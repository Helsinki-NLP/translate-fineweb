| Smith Chuck - Through the Bible C2000 SeriesShall we turn to the book of Acts, chapter one, as we begin our study of the early church.<br/>Luke, the author of the book of Acts, a companion of Paul the apostle, who was author also of the Gospel According to Luke, wrote these two treatises to a friend, Theophilus. Theophilus is a Greek name. It's a name that has a beautiful meaning. The name means lover of God. There are some who believe that it was not a man at all, but that the gospel and the book of Acts were addressed to the lovers of God, whoever you may be. There are other traditions that say that Theophilus was actually Luke's master. That in those days physicians were slaves, usually the slave of a wealthy patron. So that Luke's master was Theophilus, and he released Luke to be with Paul on the missionary journeys. Thus, Luke is writing back to his former master. This is an early tradition of the church, but it is, of course, impossible to prove, like so many of the traditions.<br/>There are also those who believe that when Paul was in Troas and he received a vision of a man calling unto him saying, "Come over to Macedonia and help us," that that man in Paul's vision was none other than Luke. For the first one that Paul really met when he came to Macedonia was Luke. And as we are in the book of Acts, you will find that when we get to that portion of the book of Acts, Luke begins to write more in the first person rather than the third person. So it is, evidently, at this particular point in the Acts of the Apostles that Luke became a companion of Paul and began to journey with him. He began to use the pronouns "we" and "us" instead of "they" and "them." This is, no doubt, where Luke became a participant and an eyewitness of those things that were happening from this point on. We will bring this out to you when we get to that point.<br/>He begins the Acts of the Apostles by tying it with the Gospel According to Luke. It is interesting that the very last thing that Luke records in his gospel is the very first thing he records in the Acts of the Apostles. We find the gospel of Luke closing as Jesus is telling His disciples to wait in Jerusalem until they be endued with power from on high. And then Jesus ascended up into heaven, and so he closes the gospel. In opening the Acts of the Apostles, he writes,<br/>The former treatise [that is, the Gospel According to Luke,] have I written unto you, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and teach ( Act 1:1 ),<br/>The key word is began. The Gospel According to Luke is not the full story of the ministry of Jesus Christ. It is only the beginning of the ministry of Jesus Christ. Jesus continues to minister to the needs of people. Jesus continues to heal the sick. Jesus continues to raise the dead. Jesus continues to minister His love and His gospel to the world, only now He is ministering through those disciples who have been anointed with His Holy Spirit. But the ministry of Christ is continuing; basically, is the premise that Luke takes in the Acts of the Apostles. The former treatise of all that Jesus began, both to do and to teach.<br/>Now because of that, the Acts of the Apostles is an unfinished book: in that the Lord today continues to work through the lives of those who have dedicated themselves to be the instruments of God. To be led and guided and anointed by His Holy Spirit, to continue the ministry of Jesus in the world today. Now God has ordained that His work should be accomplished through human instruments. I do not say that it must be accomplished. God can use angelic beings for His work, and there will come a time, during the book of Revelation when God will use angels to proclaim His gospel to people all over the world. Revelation, chapter 14, "The first angel flying through the midst of heaven having the everlasting gospel" ( Rev 14:6 ). But at the present time, God has chosen to use human instruments. As imperfect as they may be, yet that's what God has ordained to use. The exciting thing about that is, God will use me and God will use you. So many times, we're begging off, "O Lord, I can't speak. I've never been able to speak before or even now, Lord." As Moses tried to beg off the call of God. Jeremiah said, "Lord, I'm just a kid; no one's going to listen to me." And we all have our excuses why we can't be used. Don't we? We all know the reasons why God couldn't use us.<br/>One time, as the Lord was calling a prophet to do His work, he said, "Lord, send whoever you want." The Lord said, "Hey, I've called you." "Lord, good idea; send whoever you want." So often we're in that position, "Lord, send by the hand of whomsoever you will, anybody but me Lord." And yet, God has ordained to use us.<br/>Now, each of us can show our own imperfections. Each of us can point out our own inabilities, and all of us can find an excuse why God wouldn't want to use me. But yet, God has chosen to use you. That through your life He might reveal Himself to a needy world. You wonder when God has such instruments to use how He ever got the job done, don't you?<br/>Until the day in which he was taken up, after that he through the Holy Spirit had given commandments to the apostles whom he had chosen ( Act 1:2 ):<br/>That is what he ended the Gospel of Luke with. The day that Jesus was taken up, after He had told the apostles to wait for the endowment of power.<br/>To whom he also [that is the apostles he also] showed himself alive to them after his passion [or death] by many infallible proofs ( Act 1:3 ),<br/>It is difficult to deny the fact of the resurrection of Jesus Christ. I was amused, as well as annoyed and irritated, by an article I read in the Santa Ana Register this last Saturday. Of the creation science and evolutionary theories being presented in the county schools. How that, this one professor said that he teaches a science class, and thus, they deal only in facts, and that they don't have any place for theories. Because science is based upon fact and creation is based upon religious superstitions. It takes a lot of faith to believe the religious theories. When you are dealing with facts, you can just accept them. I thought, "Very interesting in that science class, they taught me it was a fact that the world was four billion years old. Now today they are teaching it's a fact that the world is twelve billion years old. And it wasn't that long ago that I went to school."<br/>It's interesting that the Bible has never needed to be revised or updated to meet the current data that men have discovered. And yet, if you would take my high school science textbooks today and try to teach a science class from them, you would find that many of the things that were taught as scientific fact when I was in high school are no longer recognized as scientific fact. The simple cell protoplasm is no longer a simple cell, but extremely complex. If there is any fact that can be attested to in history it is the fact of the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.<br/>We have a jurisprudence system that is based upon the testimony of witnesses. If a man is accused of a crime and there are people who witnessed that crime while it was being committed, and they are brought to the standard, and they swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help them God. And in their questioning they affirm that, "I saw that man in the bank on May twenty-third. I saw him pull out a gun from his coat. I heard him demand that all of the money be given to him. I saw him as he left the bank. I saw him as the officer apprehended him outside." And if you can get three or four witnesses to point to that man and will keep their testimony under cross-examination, that man is judged to be guilty. He is the one who did it. We have two or three witnesses that are testifying the same story about that man, and it is accepted as fact that he is the one who perpetrated the crime and is guilty. You've got witnesses who have sworn to tell the truth that are verifying.<br/>After the death of Jesus, when He rose again, He appeared unto many different people who gave sworn testimony that they saw Him. That they talked to Him, that He appeared to them in various places under different circumstances. And for a period of forty days was visiting with them. And at one time, up to as many as five hundred people who were gathered at one place, He appeared. It's difficult to just cast aside or deny the witness of these people. To do so is to discredit our whole jurisprudence system. But not only that, these men who testified that they saw the risen Lord, that they talked to Him, that they ate with Him, they, all of them, with the exception of one, met violent deaths at the hands of other people because of their affirming that the story they told was true. You talk about witnesses sworn to tell the truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth. If a person's life was threatened because of that witness, and it was a lie, at least one them would've broken under the pressure. They would've confessed to the entire hoax. "He showed Himself alive after His passion by many infallible proofs."<br/>being seen of them for forty days, speaking to them of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God ( Act 1:3 ):<br/>Sometimes we fault the disciples because of their questions of the timing of the kingdom of God. Let it be remembered that the kingdom of God was the favorite subject of Jesus Christ. He was always talking about the kingdom of God, and it is a great hope that He was planting into the hearts of all men. Things are not always going to continue corrupted as they are. The world is not going to go forever under the power of darkness, under the bondage of evil. God is going to one day establish His kingdom upon the earth. A kingdom of righteous joy and peace. "Jesus shall reign, where ere the sun doth her successive journeys run. And His kingdom will extend from shore to shore." And that day will be the most glorious day the world has ever seen, as sickness and suffering and pain will be abolished in His kingdom. As sin and greed and these things that have made the world such an intolerable place will be abolished in His kingdom. The godless commercialism, the exploitation of man, all of these things abolished in His glorious kingdom when He reigns. No wonder the disciples were anxious to get it on. I'm anxious to get it on; I'm anxious for His kingdom to come. And Jesus told us when we pray, the first petition is, "Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven" ( Mat 6:10 ). This is the right kind of a desire that we should all have. I desire the kingdom of God. And so He was talking to them, during this forty-day period, of the kingdom.<br/>And, being assembled together with them, he commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which, saith he, you have heard of me ( Act 1:4 ).<br/>He said, "Now look, wait here in Jerusalem until you receive the promise of the Father." This promise that He is referring to is, no doubt, the promise in Joel where the Lord promised, "And it shall come to pass in the later days, saith the Lord, that I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and daughters will prophesy, and your young men shall dream dreams, your old men shall see visions: and upon my servants and my handmaidens shall I pour out my Spirit, saith the Lord" ( Joe 2:28-29 ). The promise of the Father: the day is going to come when God is going to pour out His Spirit upon all flesh, all of the believers. They will, each one, receive that dynamic from God.<br/>For John [He said,] truly baptized with water; but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now ( Act 1:5 ).<br/>The idea of baptism was that of emersion, the bapteedzo. John baptized with water, submerged the people in water, "you're going to be submerged in the Holy Spirit in not many days."<br/>Now when they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, will you at this time restore the kingdom to Israel? ( Act 1:6 )<br/>"When is it going to be, Lord? When's the time for this restoration?" And Jesus is talking to them now, not about the kingdom, but about the power that they're going to receive for service. And so He brushes aside their question.<br/>Saying unto them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father has put in his own power ( Act 1:7 ).<br/>"It's not for you to know." They lived constantly in the anticipation of the immediate setting up of the kingdom. During the entire lifetime of Jesus, they were expecting Him at any moment to go into the phone booth and come out as the savior of the world. Shazzam! Showing His power and overthrowing the governments of the world, establishing God's kingdom upon the earth. And they were waiting daily for this change to transpire. And whenever Jesus would talk about going to Jerusalem, being turned over into the hands of sinful man, and then being crucified, "Oh, oh no, Lord. No, no you don't understand the kingdom, Lord. Be that far from Thee." When Jesus died on the cross, they were all greatly disappointed.<br/>The two disciples on the road to Emmaus, so sad. "Hey, fellows. How come you're so sad as your walking along?" "What do you mean? You must be a stranger around here if you don't know the things that have been happening lately in Jerusalem." "What things?" "Oh, a fellow by the name of Jesus of Nazareth...oh man, it was mighty and powerful. The anointing of God was upon His life. We had hoped that in Him was the deliverance of Israel, but they crucified Him. We had hoped . . . now it's dead." Now He's risen, and He's saying, "In a few days, fellows, you're going to receive the promise of the Father." "Oh, what promise? The promise of the establishing of the kingdom?" You see, it was legitimate that they should ask. "Is this it Lord? Alright! Is this the time? Are you going to set up your kingdom now?" "No. It's not for you to know those times that the Father's appointed or that the Father has in His own power. But, you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you."<br/>Now here, the Greek preposition epi is used to signify a new relationship that they were to have with the Holy Spirit. In the Gospel According to John, chapter 14, as Jesus is there promising to send the Holy Spirit, He said, "I will not leave you comfortless. I will come to you, and I will pray the Father, and He will send to you another comforter, even the Spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth Him not neither knows Him, but you know Him for He dwells with you, and He shall be in you" ( Joh 14:17-18 ). Same Greek preposition as ours, only they spell it "en" instead of "in." Two-fold relationship there in John: He is with you, but He's going to be dwelling in you. But now Jesus said you're going to receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you. The Greek preposition epi, which is translated in different texts throughout the New Testament as "upon" or "over" or I like it, "overflows."<br/>In the seventh chapter of the gospel of John: "On the last day, the great day of the feast when Jesus stood there on the Temple Mount and cried to the people, 'If any man thirst let him come unto Me and drink: and he who drinks of the water that I give, out of his innermost being there will gush torrents of living water.'" John said, "This spake He of the Spirit, which was not yet given which they who believe on Him should receive" ( Joh 7:37-39 ). What did He speak of the Spirit? That it would be like a torrent of living water flowing out. I like, "When the Spirit overflows you," upon you, or over you, or overflows from you. So the three-fold relationship: He is with you prior to your conversion, He is the one who causes you to realize that you are a sinner, He is the one who points to Jesus Christ as the answer as He convinces the world of sin, of righteous, and of judgment. The moment you open your life and heart to Jesus Christ and invite Him to come in, the Holy Spirit comes and begins to indwell you. He shall be in you. "Know ye not that you are not your own, you have been bought with a price, therefore glorify God in your body and your spirit which are His. And know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit which is in you? Be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess, but be filled, or be ye being filled with the Spirit" ( 1Co 6:19-20 ,Eph 5:18 ). But now here's a third relationship. This is an empowering experience.<br/>You will receive [the dunamus] the dynamics, when the Holy Spirit has come [epi] upon you [or over you, or when there is that overflow from you]: and ye shall be witnesses unto me ( Act 1:8 )<br/>And so the dynamic, to be a witness for Jesus Christ. It is interesting that the word witness in Greek is the word martus from where we get our word martyr. And in Greek it does mean martyr. A witness is one who not only proclaims what he believes, he lives what he believes, he is what he believes, and he believes it so strongly, that if necessary, he'll die for what he believes. That's how strong is his belief. He's a martus. You can't stop him. He's not afraid to die for what he believes.<br/>You remember when Paul was on his way back to Jerusalem and Agabus came down from Caesarea and he took Paul's girdle and tied himself up and he said, "So is the man who owns this girdle to be bound when he gets to Jerusalem." And Paul's friends began to weep, saying, "Oh, Paul, don't go, don't go." And he said, "What do you mean by these tears? Do you think you're going to dissuade me? Do you think I'm worried about being bound? I'm ready to die." He was a martus. "I'm ready to die." Being put to death for your faith did not make you a martyr; because you were a martyr, you were put to death. Because you were a witness, because you believed it so strong. So, it did not make you a witness, it only proved what you were. You were a witness all along. If you hadn't been a martus, you would've never gone to your death. You would've recanted; you would've said, "Whoa, whoa, wait, wait. Hold on, let's change course here. I think that I may have made a mistake." Then you say, "Well, he wasn't a martus. Stealing a horse doesn't make you a horse thief; it only proves that you were. No one steals a horse unless he's a horse thief. So, stealing it doesn't make you a horse thief, it only proves that you were all along. Being martyred only proves what you were a witness, a martus. "And you will be witnesses." And isn't it interesting that most of them were martyred? "Witnesses unto Me."<br/>The witness was to be both in Jerusalem, and in all of Judea ( Act 1:8 ),<br/>The witness began right at home. The hardest place, isn't it? It's to start right at home in Jerusalem, and then the area around Jerusalem, the area of Judea. And then it was to spread up into Samaria. And then it was to go out into the uttermost parts of the world. And as we study the book of Acts, we will see this very progression. How the witness began in Jerusalem. We'll get that in the next chapter. And then we'll see how it began to spread through out Judea. And then Phillip went up into Samaria, and then finally Paul and Barnabas are called to go into the uttermost parts of the world. And so the witness spread through the anointing and the empowering of the Holy Spirit.<br/>Now when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight ( Act 1:9 ).<br/>This is the final promise made by Jesus to His disciples. This is it, the final words prior to His ascension. Of course, later He came and talked to Paul and others, but prior to His ascension, this is His final word. And upon this, when He had spoken these things, while they were watching Him, He was taken up and a cloud received Him out of their sight.<br/>And while they were looking steadfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, there were two men who stood by them in white apparel ( Act 1:10 );<br/>We assume they were angels.<br/>Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as you have seen him go into heaven ( Act 1:11 ).<br/>They saw Him as He ascended up into heaven and they will behold Him when He comes again. "Behold the Lord cometh with ten thousands of His saints, to execute judgement upon the earth" (Jud 1:14-15). And then, "Unto Him who loved us and gave Himself for us and who has made us unto our God, kings and priests who shall reign with Him upon the earth, behold the Lord cometh, and every eye shall see Him, and they also who pierced Him shall mourn" Rev 1:5-7 ). So the Lord's coming. Every eye shall see Him. The Jehovah Witnesses say that He is already come, but it was a secret coming. As it was only the disciples that saw Him go, it was only the disciples, of the Jehovah Witnesses, who saw Him return. But Jesus said, "If they say unto you, 'He has come in secret and has gone into a secret chamber don't believe it'" ( Mat 24:26 ). So you have to choose, to believe Jesus or them.<br/>"This same Jesus which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as you've seen Him go into heaven."<br/>Now there's a very interesting verse in II John, verse Act 1:7 , "For many deceivers are entered into the world who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh." That, unfortunately, is a poor translation of the Greek. For this participle is in the present tense and should be translated "is coming in the flesh." Those who would deny that Jesus Christ is coming in the flesh. What does John say of them? "They are a deceiver and an antichrist. Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward. For whosoever transgresses and abides not in the doctrine of Christ, has not God. He that abides in the doctrine of Christ, he has both the Father and the Son. And if there come any unto your door (on Saturday morning) and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, and neither bid him good-bye. For he that bids him good-bye is a partaker of his evil deeds" (2Jn 1:7-11). Ask them one question, "Is Jesus coming in the flesh?" Just ask them that question. And if they say no, just remember what John warned you and what John told you. "If any confess not that Jesus Christ is coming in the flesh." Do you remember when He was with the disciples and He said, "Give me something to eat"? He said, "You know, spirits don't eat; touch me. See? It's me." So, this same Jesus is coming again in the same manner in which they saw Him go into heaven. And I, for one, believe that that coming is very soon.<br/>Then retuned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a Sabbath's day journey [about two-thirds of a mile]. And when they were come in, they went up into an upper room, where there abode both Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, and Phillip, and Thomas, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon Zelotes, and Judas the brother of James. And these all continued in one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers ( Act 1:12-14 ).<br/>This is the last mention of Mary the mother of Jesus. At this point and from this point on, there is no further mention of her in the Acts of the Apostles or in the epistles. No mention of her death or of her miraculous ascension into heaven, without death. Nothing is mentioned in the scripture. It is silent.<br/>His brethren would be a reference probably to James and to Jude and to those other brothers who were sons of Joseph and Mary.<br/>The upper room--there are some who say that it is the same upper room in which Jesus had the Last Supper with His disciples. And yet, there are others who hold to this upper room being a room in the temple precincts where the early church met. Take your choice.<br/>And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples, and said, (the number of their names together were about one hundred and twenty,) men and brethren, this Scripture must needs have been fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit by the mouth of David spake before concerning Judas, which was a guide to those who took Jesus ( Act 1:15-16 ).<br/>Here again, Peter still his same impetuous self. They're waiting in prayer and supplication, and Peter stands up and says, "Fellows, there's a scripture that's gotta be fulfilled." And you know he's going to move ahead, "Let's get the program going; let's cast lots and find out who's going to take Judas' place." I do feel that Peter was again in the flesh, manifesting that impetuous nature that was his. And I think that the future history of the church in the book of Acts points this out. I am interested in Peter's understanding of the scriptures, how that he is quoting from so many places in the Old Testament. Peter does manifest a very great understanding of the Old Testament scriptures which is a point in his favor.<br/>Notice that Peter ascribes to the Holy Spirit those things that David wrote. So that, "All scripture is given by inspiration of God" ( 2Ti 3:16 ). Not part of the scriptures. Because, if you tell me that part of the scriptures are given by inspiration of God, then I must ask you, "What parts are by inspiration and what parts are not by inspiration?" And then you are then the authority who tells me what part I can believe and what part I can't believe. And the minute that God is no longer the authority but you're the authority, I'm in trouble. Beware of those who say, "Well, you can't believe all of the scriptures." The scriptures themselves say, "All scripture is given by inspiration of God." And here, Luke in writing of what Peter was saying, declares that David was actually the spokesman for the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit, by the mouth of David, spake concerning Judas.<br/>For he was numbered with us, [he was one of the twelve] he had obtained a part of this ministry. But now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity; and falling headlong ( Act 1:17-18 ),<br/>He purchased the field, the potter's field as Zachariah the eleventh chapter declares.<br/>and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all of his bowels gushed out ( Act 1:18 ).<br/>There are those who find a discrepancy in the scriptures, because in one of the gospels we are told that when Judas came back and tried to return the money, and they said, "Hey, it's your problem. We can't take it." And put it back in the temple treasury. "It's blood money." Then he threw it there on the floor of the temple and he went out and hung himself. Here Peter tells us that he fell headlong and just popped. And there are those who imagine a discrepancy. Very simple, he went up into the tree to hang himself, tied the rope around his neck and tied it to the limb and jumped. And the force of the fall either snapped the rope or his head, and he fell on down into the canyon and just as he said it here.<br/>It was known to all of the dwellers at Jerusalem; insomuch that the field is called in their tongue, Aceldama, that is to say, The field of blood. For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be desolate, and let no man dwell therein: and, His bishoprick let another take ( Act 1:19-20 ).<br/>Now in reality he's quoting from two different Psalms here. From Psa 69:25 ,he puts it together with Psa 109:8 . And putting the two together he finds these prophecies concerning Judas.<br/>Wherefore of these men ( Act 1:21 )<br/>Now here is where they are looking for someone to take Judas' place to be an apostle. Here are the qualifications they looked for in that time.<br/>Wherefore of these men which have companied with us all the time that the Lord Jesus when in and out among us ( Act 1:21 ),<br/>Now you remember there were many disciples, many disciples of which Jesus chose ten to be apostles. And the word apostle means "one who is sent out." Or chose twelve to be apostles, so He sent out the twelve. The number of human government. "We only have eleven. We need one to take Judas' place, but we need one who has been with us all the while from the beginning with Jesus."<br/>From the time he was baptized by John, until the day he was taken up from us, must one be ordained to be a witness [of what?] of His resurrection ( Act 1:22 ).<br/>So these were the requirements they were looking for. Someone who had been around the whole while. From the time of John's baptism to the ascension. And one who saw the risen Lord, and thus could bear fact of the resurrection, their testimony to the fact.<br/>Now Paul the apostle, later in asserting the fact that he was an apostle said, "Have I not seen the risen Christ?" Evidently that was one of the requirements of apostleship. Someone asked me, "Are there apostles today?" Well, I don't know. I don't think that there are in the same sense that they were in the New Testament. Surely there is none today who can bear witness to the resurrection as they did.<br/>They appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias. And they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord, which knowest the hearts of all men, show whether of these two that you have chosen ( Act 1:23-24 ),<br/>I think that we often make this mistake of giving the Lord two choices, both wrong. Limiting God, you see. We're so prone to do this. Obviously, Paul was God's choice. Peter was impetuous, and jumping the gun said, "Hey, we've got to do something, you know, gotta help God out. You know, one's missing and we've got to fill him in." And yet, "God, which one of these two do you want?" And giving God the two choices.<br/>That he may take part of this ministry and this apostleship, from which Judas by the transgression fell, that he might go to his own place. And so they gave forth their lots ( Act 1:25-26 );<br/>An interesting way by which they sought to determine the will of God. Let's throw dice, find out what God's will is here. It's interesting to me, the various ways that people have devised to discern the will of God. Now, in the Old Testament times they had an interesting way of coming to the priest, who would inquire of the Lord for them through the Urim and the Thummim, the "lights and perfections." Just what these Urim and Thummim were, we don't know. I'm sure they were not the colored glasses that Joseph Smith found with the Golden Tablets; the magic glasses, that when you put them on, you could suddenly read the hieroglyphic writing.<br/>There are those who say that the Urim and Thummim were actually a black and a white stone that was worn in a pouch on the chest of the priest. They would pray and ask the Lord a particular question. You remember that David was asking the Lord definite questions: "Lord, shall we go out against the Philistines?" The answer was, "No." So again, the next day, "Lord, shall we go out against the Philistines?" The answer was, "Yes." "When shall we go?" They would ask specific questions, and the Lord would direct them through the Urim and the Thummin. They say that the priest would pray, seek God, and then reach in and pull out one of the two stones. If it was the white stone, it was a yes answer. If it was a no, then it would be the black stone that he would pull out. Some even say we get the term blackballed from this Urim and Thummim. Actually, back in the original it is a no vote against a particular project or idea. Just what the Urim and Thummim were, we don't know. But during the Old Testament period, they did use a method of casting lots to determine the will of God.<br/>So here the disciples are picking up on the same thing as they are throwing the dice to see which of the two fellows that God had chosen to replace Judas Iscariot.<br/>the lot fell on Matthias; he was numbered with the eleven ( Act 1:26 ).<br/>Now who in the world is Matthias? No one ever heard of him before or since. It'll be interesting to meet Matthias and find out who he is and what he did. I think from the subsequent history, it's obvious to assume that God chose Paul as an apostle. Paul declares it himself. Now this is the last time we ever read of them seeking to discern the will of God by the casting of lots or by a chance kind of a thing.<br/>I know a fellow today, in seeking to discern the will of the Lord, will pray and ask the Lord a question. He'll have ten pennies in his pocket, and as he's praying, he'll take the pennies with his eyes closed and put them down on the table, and if they all come up heads, it's a yes. An interesting thing, every once in a while, they'll all come up heads, and that's pretty good odds. Yet, we don't find any pattern for this after the Holy Spirit was given. Once the Holy Spirit came upon the church, then the Holy Spirit began to speak to them and direct them. And the Holy Spirit said, "Separate unto me Paul and Barnabas for the ministry where I have called them" ( Act 13:2 ). And the Holy Spirit sent them forth. So we find the church more directly guided by the Holy Spirit. Once the Holy Spirit came, this throwing dice to find out the will of God was set aside.<br/>"<br/><br/>King James Version<br/><br/>This is the 1769 King James Version of the Holy Bible (also known as the Authorized Version). "Public Domain" | Smith Chuck – Skozi Sveto pismo C2000 SeriesBomo obrnili na knjigo Apostolska dela, poglavje 1, kot smo začeli naše preučevanje zgodnje cerkve.<br/>Lukež, avtor knjige Apostolska dela, spremljevalec Pavla apostola, ki je bil tudi avtor evangelija Po Luku, je ta dva razprava napisal prijatelju Teofilu. Teofil je grško ime. To je ime, ki ima lep pomen. Ime pomeni ljubitelj Boga. Obstajajo nekateri, ki verjamejo, da sploh ni bil človek, ampak da sta bila evangelij in knjiga Apostolska dela naslovljena na ljubitelje Boga, kdorkoli že ste. Obstajajo tudi druge tradicije, ki pravijo, da je bil Teofil pravzaprav Lukov gospodar, da so bili v tistih časih zdravniki sužnji, običajno sužnji bogatega pokrovitelja. Tako da je bil Lukov gospodar Teofil in je izpustil Luka, da bi bil s Pavlom na misijonarskih potovanjih. Tako Luka piše nazaj svojemu nekdanjemu gospodarju. To je zgodnje izročilo cerkve, vendar ga je seveda nemogoče dokazati, tako kot mnoge tradicije.<br/>Obstajajo tudi tisti, ki verjamejo, da ko je bil Pavel v Troadi in je dobil videnje človeka, ki ga kliče, rekoč: »Pridi v Makedonijo in nam pomagaj,« da je bil ta človek v Pavlovem videnju nihče drug kot Lukež. Kajti prvi, ki ga je Pavel resnično srečal, ko je prišel v Makedonijo, je bil Lukež. In ker smo v knjigi Apostolska dela, boste ugotovili, da ko pridemo do tega dela knjige Apostolska dela, Lukež začne pisati več v prvi osebi kot v tretji osebi. Tako je očitno, da je na tej točki v Apostolskih delih Luka postal Pavlov spremljevalec in začel potovati z njim. Začel je uporabljati zaimke »mi« in »mi« namesto »oni« in »oni«. To je nedvomno mesto, kjer je Luke postal udeleženec in priča tistih stvari, ki so se dogajale od tega trenutka naprej. To vam bomo povedali, ko pridemo do te točke.<br/>Apostolska dela začne tako, da jih poveže z evangelijem po Luku. Zanimivo je, da je zadnja stvar, ki jo Luka zapiše v svojem evangeliju, prva stvar, ki jo zapiše v Apostolska dela. Najdemo evangelij Luke zaključuje, kot je Jezus pove svojim učencem, da počakajte v Jeruzalemu, dokler ne bodo obdani z močjo od zgoraj. In potem Jezus se je povzpel v nebesa, in tako zapre evangelij. V odpiranju Apostolska dela, piše,<br/>Nekdanja razprava (to je evangelij po Luku) sem ti napisal, o Teofil, o vsem, kar je Jezus začel delati in učiti (Apostolska dela 1:1),<br/>Ključna beseda se je začela. Evangelij po Lukežu ni celotna zgodba o službi Jezusa Kristusa. To je le začetek službe Jezusa Kristusa. Jezus še naprej služi potrebam ljudi. Jezus še naprej zdravi bolne. Jezus še naprej oživlja mrtve. Jezus še naprej služi svetu svojo ljubezen in evangelij, šele zdaj služi preko tistih učencev, ki so bili maziljeni s svojim Svetim Duhom. Toda Kristusova služba se nadaljuje; v bistvu, je predpostavka, da Luke sprejme v Apostolskih delih. Prejšnja razprava o vsem, kar je Jezus začel, tako delati in učiti.<br/>Zaradi tega so Apostolska dela nedokončana knjiga: v tem Gospod danes še naprej deluje skozi življenje tistih, ki so se posvetili temu, da bi bili božja orodja. Da bi ga vodil in vodil in mazilil njegov Sveti Duh, da bi danes nadaljeval Jezusovo službo v svetu. Zdaj je Bog odredil, da bi bilo njegovo delo opravljeno s človeškimi instrumenti. Ne pravim, da mora biti opravljeno. Bog lahko uporabi angelska bitja za svoje delo in prišel bo čas, ko bo Bog v knjigi Razodetja uporabil angele za oznanjevanje svojega evangelija ljudem po vsem svetu. Razodetje, poglavje 14, "Prvi angel, ki leti po sredi neba, ki imajo večni evangelij" (Raz 14:6). Toda v sedanjem času, Bog se je odločil za uporabo človeških instrumentov. Kot nepopolni, kot so lahko, vendar je to tisto, kar je Bog odredil, da se uporabljajo. Vznemirljiva stvar pri tem je, Bog me bo uporabil in Bog te bo uporabil. Tolikokrat smo prosili, "Gospod, ne morem govoriti. Nikoli nisem mogel govoriti prej ali celo zdaj, Gospod." Kot je Mojzes poskušal prositi od božjega klica. Jeremiah je rekel: "Gospod, jaz sem samo otrok; nihče me ne bo poslušal." In vsi imamo svoje izgovore, zakaj nas ne morejo uporabiti. Kajne? Vsi vemo razloge, zakaj Bog ne bi mogel uporabiti nas.<br/>Nekoč, ko je Gospod poklical preroka, da opravi njegovo delo, je rekel: »Gospod, pošlji, kogar hočeš.« Gospod je rekel: »Hej, poklical sem te.« »Gospod, dobra zamisel; pošlji, kogar hočeš.« Pogosto smo v takšnem položaju, "Gospod, pošlji po roki, kogarkoli hočeš, kogarkoli razen mene, Gospod." In kljub temu, Bog je odredil, da nas uporabi.<br/>Zdaj lahko vsak od nas pokaže svoje lastne pomanjkljivosti. Vsak od nas lahko poudari svoje lastne nesposobnosti, in vsi mi lahko najdejo izgovor, zakaj Bog ne bi želel uporabiti mene. Ampak kljub temu, Bog se je odločil, da vas uporabi. Sprašujete se, kdaj ima Bog takšna orodja za uporabo, kako je kdaj opravil svoje delo, kajne?<br/>Do dne, ko je bil vzet, potem ko je po Svetem Duhu dal zapovedi apostolom, ki jih je izbral (Apd 1,2):<br/>To je tisto, s čimer je zaključil Lukov evangelij. Na dan, ko je bil Jezus vzet, potem ko je rekel apostolom, naj počakajo na obdaritev moči.<br/>Tistim, ki jim se je po trpljenju (ali smrti) z mnogimi nezmotljivimi dokazi prikazal živ,<br/>Težko je zanikati dejstvo vstajenja Jezusa Kristusa. Bil sem zabaven, pa tudi razburjen in razdražen, s člankom, ki sem ga prebral v registru Santa Ana prejšnjo soboto. O naravoslovju in evolucijskih teorijah, ki so bile predstavljene v okrožnih šolah. Kako je ta profesor rekel, da poučuje naravoslovje, zato se ukvarjajo le z dejstvi in da nimajo prostora za teorije. Ker znanost temelji na dejstvih in ustvarjanje temelji na verskih vraževerjih. Potrebno je veliko vere, da verjamemo verskim teorijam. Ko se ukvarjate z dejstvi, jih lahko preprosto sprejmete. Pomislil sem, "Zelo zanimivo v tem znanstvenem razredu, naučili so me, da je svet star štiri milijarde let. Zdaj učijo, da je svet star dvanajst milijard let. Ni bilo tako dolgo, odkar sem šla v šolo.«<br/>Zanimivo je, da Svetega pisma nikoli ni bilo treba revidirati ali posodabljati, da bi izpolnili trenutne podatke, ki so jih odkrili ljudje. In vendar, če bi danes vzeli moje srednješolske znanstvene učbenike in poskusili iz njih poučevati naravoslovje, bi ugotovili, da veliko stvari, ki so se učile kot znanstveno dejstvo, ko sem bil v srednji šoli, niso več priznane kot znanstveno dejstvo. Enostavna celična protoplazma ni več preprosta celica, ampak izjemno zapletena. Če obstaja kakršno koli dejstvo, ki ga je mogoče potrditi v zgodovini, je to dejstvo vstajenja Jezusa Kristusa od mrtvih.<br/>Imamo sistem sodne prakse, ki temelji na pričanjih prič. Če je človek obtožen kaznivega dejanja in obstajajo ljudje, ki so bili priča temu kaznivemu dejanju, medtem ko je bilo storjeno, in so pripeljani do merila, in prisežejo, da bodo povedali resnico, vso resnico in nič drugega kot resnico, potem jim Bog pomagaj. In v svojem zaslišanju trdijo, da: "Videl sem, da je človek v banki na maj triindvajsetega. Videl sem, da je izvlekel pištolo iz plašča. Slišal sem, da zahteva, da se mu ves denar. Videl sem ga, ko je zapustil banko. Videl sem ga, ko ga je policist aretiral zunaj.« In če lahko pripeljete tri ali štiri priče, da pokažejo na tega človeka, in boste njihovo pričevanje obdržali pod navzkrižnim zaslišanjem, bo ta človek obsojen za krivega. On je tisti, ki je to storil. Imamo dve ali tri priče, ki pričajo isto zgodbo o tem človeku, in je sprejeto kot dejstvo, da je on tisti, ki je storil zločin in je kriv.<br/>Po Jezusovi smrti, ko je vstal, se je prikazal mnogim ljudem, ki so prisegli, da so ga videli, da so govorili z njim, da se jim je prikazal na različnih krajih v različnih okoliščinah. In za obdobje štirideset dni je bil na obisku z njimi. In naenkrat, do petsto ljudi, ki so se zbrali na enem mestu, se je prikazal. Težko je samo odvrniti ali zanikati pričevanje teh ljudi. To pomeni diskreditacijo celotnega sistema sodne prakse. Toda ne samo to, ti možje, ki so pričevali, da so videli vstalega Gospoda, da so govorili z njim, da so jedli z njim, so vsi, razen enega, doživeli nasilne smrti iz rok drugih ljudi, ker so trdili, da je zgodba, ki so jo povedali, resnična. Govorite o pričah, ki so prisegle, da bodo povedale resnico, vso resnico, nič drugega kot resnico. Priznali bi, da se je po trpljenju prikazal živ z mnogimi nezmotljivimi dokazi.<br/>ki jih je videl štirideset dni in jim govoril o božjem kraljestvu (Apd 1,3):<br/>Včasih krivimo učence zaradi njihovih vprašanj o času Božjega kraljestva. Naj se spomnimo, da je bilo Božje kraljestvo najljubši predmet Jezusa Kristusa. Vedno je govoril o Božjem kraljestvu in veliko upanje je, da je bil posejan v srca vseh ljudi. Stvari ne bodo vedno še naprej pokvarjene, kot so. Svet ne bo šel večno pod oblastjo teme, pod suženjstvom zla. Bog bo nekega dne vzpostavil svoje kraljestvo na zemlji. Kraljestvo pravičnega veselja in miru. "Jezus bo vladal, kjer bo sonce teklo na svojih zaporednih potovanjih in njegovo kraljestvo se bo razširilo od obale do obale." In ta dan bo najbolj veličasten dan, ki ga je svet kdaj videl, ko bodo v njegovem kraljestvu odpravljene bolezni, trpljenje in bolečina, kakor greh in pohlep ter vse te stvari, ki so naredile svet tako nevzdržno mesto, bodo odpravljene v njegovem kraljestvu. Brezbožni komercializem, izkoriščanje človeka, vse te stvari so bile odpravljene v njegovem veličastnem kraljestvu, ko je vladal. Ni čudno, da so učenci hrepeneli, da bi ga dobili. Jaz hrepenim, da bi ga dobili; Jaz hrepenim, da bi njegovo kraljestvo prišlo. In Jezus nam je povedal, ko molimo, prva prošnja je: "Pridi kraljestvo tvoje. Zgodi se volja tvoja na zemlji, kot je v nebesih" (Mat 6, 10 ). To je prava vrsta želje, ki bi jo morali vsi imeti. Želim Božje kraljestvo. In tako jim je v tem štiridesetdnevnem obdobju govoril o kraljestvu.<br/>Ko se je zbral z njimi, jim je zapovedal, naj ne odhajajo iz Jeruzalema, ampak naj čakajo na Očetovo obljubo, ki ste jo slišali od mene (Apd 1,4).<br/>Rekel je: »Glej, počakaj v Jeruzalemu, dokler ne prejmeš Očetove obljube.« Ta obljuba, o kateri govori, je nedvomno obljuba v Joelu, kjer je Gospod obljubil: »In zgodilo se bo v poznejših dneh, govori Gospod, da bom izlil svojega Duha na vsako meso; in vaši sinovi in hčere bodo prerokovali in vaši mladeniči bodo sanjali sanje, vaši starci bodo videli videnja. Očetova obljuba: bo prišel dan, ko bo Bog izlil svojega Duha na vse meso, na vse vernike. Vsak bo prejel to dinamiko od Boga.<br/>Janez je bil namreč krščen z vodo, vi pa boste krščeni s Svetim Duhom šele čez nekaj dni (Apd 1,5).<br/>Janez je krstil z vodo, potopil ljudstvo v vodo in rekel: »V nekaj dneh boste potopljeni v Svetega Duha.«<br/>Ko so se torej zbrali, so ga vprašali: »Gospod, ali boš v tem času obnovil kraljestvo Izraelu?« (Apd 1,6)<br/>»Kdaj bo to, Gospod? Kdaj bo čas za to obnovo?« In Jezus jim zdaj ne govori o kraljestvu, ampak o moči, ki jo bodo prejeli za služenje. In tako odvrne njihovo vprašanje.<br/>Rekli so jim: »Ni vaša stvar, da poznate čase ali čase, ki jih je Oče postavil v svojo lastno moč.« (Apd 1,7)<br/>"To ni za vas, da bi vedeli." Stalno so živeli v pričakovanju takojšnje vzpostavitve kraljestva. V celotnem Jezusovem življenju so pričakovali, da bo v vsakem trenutku šel v telefonsko govorilnico in prišel ven kot rešitelj sveta. Shazzam! Pokazal je svojo moč in strmoglavil vlade sveta, vzpostavil Božje kraljestvo na zemlji. In vsak dan so čakali, da se ta sprememba zgodi. In vsakič, ko je Jezus govoril o odhodu v Jeruzalem, je bil predan v roke grešnega človeka, nato pa je bil križan, "Oh, oh ne, Gospod. Ne, ne razumeš kraljestva, Gospod. Bodi tako daleč od tebe." Ko je Jezus umrl na križu, so bili vsi zelo razočarani.<br/>Dva učenca na poti v Emaus, tako žalostno. "Hej, fantje. Kako to, da ste tako žalostni, kot ste hodili?" "Kaj misliš? Morate biti tujec tukaj, če ne veste, kaj se dogaja v zadnjem času v Jeruzalemu." "Kakšne stvari?" "O, mož po imenu Jezus iz Nazareta...o človek, bil je mogočen in močan. Božje maziljenje je bilo nad njegovim življenjem. Upali smo, da je v njem osvoboditev Izraela, vendar so ga križali. Upali smo . . . zdaj je mrtev." Zdaj je vstal in pravi: »Čez nekaj dni boste prejeli Očetovo obljubo.« »Oh, kakšna obljuba? Obljuba o vzpostavitvi kraljestva?« Vidiš, bilo je upravičeno, da vprašajo. »Ali je to Gospod? V redu! Ali je to čas? Boste zdaj postavili svoje kraljestvo? "Ne. Ni za vas, da bi vedeli tiste čase, ki jih je določil Oče ali ki jih ima Oče v svoji moči. Toda prejeli boste moč, ko pride na vas Sveti Duh. "<br/>Tukaj se grški predlog epi uporablja za označevanje novega odnosa, ki naj bi ga imeli s Svetim Duhom. V Evangeliju po Janezu, poglavju 14, ko je Jezus obljubil, da bo poslal Svetega Duha, je rekel: »Ne bom vas pustil brez udobja. Prišel bom k vam in prosil Očeta, in poslal vam bo drugega tolažnika, Duha resnice, ki ga svet ne more sprejeti, ker ga ne vidi in ga ne pozna, vi pa ga poznate, ker prebiva z vami in bo v vas« (Jn 14,17-18). Isti grški predlog kot naš, le da ga črkujejo "en" namesto "v". Dvojni odnos tam v Janezu: On je z vami, vendar On bo prebival v vas. Toda zdaj je Jezus rekel, da boste prejeli moč, ko Sveti Duh pride na vas. Grški predlog epi, ki je v različnih besedilih po vsej Novi zavezi preveden kot "na" ali "preko" ali kot mi je všeč, "preliva".<br/>V sedmem poglavju Janezovega evangelija piše: »Zadnjega dne, velikega prazničnega dne, ko je Jezus stal na tempeljski gori in klical ljudstvo: ‚Če bi kdorkoli bil žejen, naj pride k meni in pije. Janez je rekel: "To je govoril o Duhu, ki še ni bilo dano, da bi tisti, ki verujejo vanj, prejeli" (Jn 7,37-39 ). Kaj je govoril o Duhu? Da bi bilo kot potok žive vode, ki teče ven. Všeč mi je: "Ko vas Duh preplavi," nad vami, ali nad vami, ali preplavi od vas. Torej trojni odnos: On je z vami pred vašim spreobrnjenjem, On je tisti, ki vam daje spoznati, da ste grešnik, On je tisti, ki kaže na Jezusa Kristusa kot odgovor, ko prepričuje svet greha, pravičnosti in sodbe. V trenutku, ko odprete svoje življenje in srce Jezusu Kristusu in ga povabite, da vstopi, pride Sveti Duh in začne prebivati v vas. On bo v vas. Ali ne veste, da niste svoji, da ste bili kupljeni z drago ceno, zato poveličujte Boga v svojem telesu in v svojem duhu, ki sta njegova? In ne veste, da je vaše telo tempelj Svetega Duha, ki je v vas? Ne pijte vina, v katerem je presežek, ampak se napolnite, ali pa se napolnite z Duhom« (1 Kor 6,19-20 , Ef 5,18 ). Zdaj pa je tu tretji odnos. To je močna izkušnja.<br/>Prejeli boste dinamiko, ko bo Sveti Duh prišel nad vas (ali nad vas, ali ko se bo to prelilo od vas) in mi boste priče (Apd 1,8).<br/>In tako dinamika, da je priča za Jezusa Kristusa. Zanimivo je, da je beseda priča v grščini je beseda martus, od koder smo dobili našo besedo mučenik. In v grščini to pomeni mučenik. Priča je tisti, ki ne samo oznanja, kar verjame, živi, kar verjame, je to, kar verjame, in verjame tako močno, da bo, če bo potrebno, umrl za to, kar verjame. To je, kako močna je njegova vera. On je martus. Ne moreš ga ustaviti, ne boji se umreti za to, v kar verjame.<br/>Spomnite se, ko je bil Pavel na poti nazaj v Jeruzalem in je Agab prišel iz Cezareje in vzel Pavlov pas, se zvezal in rekel: »Tako je s tistim, ki ima ta pas, da ga zvežejo, ko pride v Jeruzalem.« In Paulovi prijatelji so začeli jokati, rekoč: "Oh, Paul, ne odhajaj, ne odhajaj." In rekel je: "Kaj misliš s temi solzami? Misliš, da me boš odvrnil? Misliš, da me skrbi, da bi bil zvezan? Pripravljen sem umreti." Bil je martus. »Pripravljen sem umreti.« Ker si bil usmrčen za svojo vero, nisi bil mučenec; ker si bil mučenec, si bil usmrčen. Ker si bil priča, ker si veroval tako močno. Torej te ni naredilo za pričo, le dokazalo je, kakšen si. Ves čas si bil priča. Če ne bi bil martus, ne bi nikoli šel v smrt. Odrekel bi se; rekel bi: "Whoa, whoa, počakaj, počakaj. Počakaj, da spremenimo smer. Mislim, da sem naredil napako." Potem rečeš: "No, ni bil martus. Kradenje konja ne pomeni, da si konjski tat; samo dokazuje, da si bil. Nihče ne krade konja, razen če je konjski tat. Torej, če ga ukradeš, ne pomeni, da si konjski tat, ampak samo dokazuje, da si bil ves čas mučen. Biti mučenec samo dokazuje, kaj si bil priča, martus. "In vi boste priče." In ali ni zanimivo, da je bila večina mučenikov? "Priče zame."<br/>Priča naj bi bila v Jeruzalemu in po vsej Judeji (Apd 1,8).<br/>Pričevanje se je začelo doma. Najtežji kraj, kajne? Začelo se je doma v Jeruzalemu, nato območje okoli Jeruzalema, območje Judeje. In potem se je razširilo v Samarijo. In potem je bilo, da gredo ven v skrajnih delih sveta. In kot smo študirali knjigo Apostolska dela, bomo videli točno ta napredek. Kako se je pričevanje začelo v Jeruzalemu. To bomo dobili v naslednjem poglavju. In potem bomo videli, kako se je začelo širiti po Judeji. In potem je Filip šel v Samarijo, in potem sta končno Pavel in Barnaba poklicana, da gresta v skrajne konce sveta. In tako se je pričevanje širilo po maziljenju in moči Svetega Duha.<br/>Ko pa je to govoril, so ga gledali in vzdignil se je; in oblak ga je odnesel izpred njihovih oči (Apd 1,9).<br/>To je zadnja obljuba, ki jo je Jezus dal svojim učencem. To je to, zadnje besede pred Njegovim vnebohodom. Seveda je kasneje prišel in govoril s Pavlom in drugimi, toda pred Njegovim vnebohodom je to Njegova zadnja beseda. In ko je to govoril, ko so ga opazovali, so ga vzdignili in oblak ga je odnesel izpred njihovih oči.<br/>In medtem ko so gledali proti nebu, ko je šel gor, glej, dva moža sta stala ob njih v belih oblačilih (Apd 1,10).<br/>Domnevamo, da so bili angeli.<br/>Rekel je tudi: »Galilejski možje, zakaj stojite in gledate v nebesa?« Ta Jezus, ki je bil od vas vzet v nebesa, bo prišel tako, kakor ste ga videli iti v nebesa (Apd 1,11).<br/>Videli so ga, ko se je povzpel v nebesa, in ga bodo videli, ko se vrne. »Glej, Gospod prihaja z deset tisoči svojih svetnikov, da izvrši sodbo na zemlji« (Jud 1,14-15). Tistemu, ki nas je ljubil in se dal za nas in ki nas je postavil našemu Bogu, kraljem in duhovnikom, ki bodo z njim kraljevali na zemlji, glej, Gospod prihaja in vsako oko ga bo videlo in tudi tisti, ki so ga prebodli, bodo žalovali. Torej Gospod prihaja. Vsako oko ga bo videlo. Jehovove priče pravijo, da je že prišel, vendar je bil to skrivni prihod. Ker so ga videli samo učenci, ki so ga videli oditi, so ga videli le učenci, Jehovove priče, ki so ga videli, da se vrne. Jezus pa je rekel: »Če vam bodo rekli: ‚Prišel je na skrivnem in je šel v skrivno sobo, ne verjemite!‘« (Mt 24,26). Torej morate izbrati, ali verjeti Jezusu ali njim.<br/>Ta Jezus, ki je bil vzet od vas v nebesa, bo prišel tako, kakor ste ga videli iti v nebesa.<br/>Zdaj je zelo zanimiv verz v II Janez, verz Act 1:7 , "Za veliko prevarantov so vstopili na svet, ki ne priznavajo, da je Jezus Kristus prišel v mesu." To, na žalost, je slab prevod grščine. Kajti ta delež je v sedanjem času in je treba prevesti "prihaja v mesu." Tisti, ki bi zanikali, da Jezus Kristus prihaja v mesu. Kaj pravi Janez o njih? "So prevarant in antikrist. Pazite sami na sebe, da ne izgubimo tega, kar smo delali, ampak da prejmemo polno plačilo. Kdor namreč prestopi in ne ostane v nauku Kristusovem, nima Boga. Kdor ostaja v nauku Kristusovem, ima tako Očeta kot Sina. In če kdo pride k vašim vratom (v soboto zjutraj) in tega nauka ne prinaša, ga ne sprejemajte v svojo hišo in ga ne pozdravite. Kajti kdor se poslovi od njega, je deležen njegovih hudobnih del" (2Jn 1:7-11). Vprašajte jih eno vprašanje: "Ali Jezus prihaja v mesu?" Samo vprašajte jih to vprašanje. In če pravijo, da ne, samo spomnite se, kaj je Janez vas je opozoril in kaj je Janez vam povedal. "Če kdo ne prizna, da Jezus Kristus prihaja v mesu." Se spomniš, ko je bil z učenci in je rekel, "Daj mi jesti?" On je rekel, "Veš, duhovi ne jedo; dotaknite se me. Vidiš? To sem jaz." Torej, ta isti Jezus prihaja spet na enak način, kot so ga videli iti v nebesa. In jaz, za enega, verjamem, da je ta prihod zelo kmalu.<br/>Nato so se vrnili v Jeruzalem z gore, ki se imenuje Oliveta, ki je od Jeruzalema v sobotni dan potovanja. In ko so prišli, so šli gori v zgornjo sobo, kjer so prebivali Peter in Jakob in Janez in Andrej in Filip in Tomaž in Bartolomej in Matej, Jakob Alfejev in Simon Zelot in Juda Jakobov brat. In vsi so ostali v enoti v molitvi in prošnji, z ženami in Marijo, materjo Jezusovo, in z njegovimi brati (Apd 1,12-14).<br/>To je zadnja omemba Marije, Jezusove matere. Na tej točki in od tega trenutka dalje, ni več omembe o njej v Apostolskih delih ali v pismih. Nobene omembe o njeni smrti ali njenem čudežnem vnebohodu, brez smrti. Nič ni omenjeno v Svetem pismu.<br/>Njegovi bratje naj bi se verjetno nanašali na Jakoba in Judo ter na druge brate, ki so bili sinovi Jožefa in Marije.<br/>Zgornja soba - obstajajo nekateri, ki pravijo, da je to ista zgornja soba, v kateri je imel Jezus zadnjo večerjo s svojimi učenci. In vendar, obstajajo tudi drugi, ki držijo, da je ta zgornja soba soba v templju okrožjih, kjer se je zgodnja cerkev srečala. Izberi si.<br/>In v tistih dneh je Peter vstal sredi učencev in rekel (število njihovih imen je bilo skupaj okoli sto dvajset), možje in bratje, mora se izpolniti to Sveto pismo, ki ga je Sveti Duh po Davidovih ustih govoril o Judu, ki je bil vodnik tistim, ki so vzeli Jezusa (Apd 1,15-16).<br/>Peter še vedno čaka v molitvi in prošnji, Peter pa vstane in reče: "Fantje, obstaja svetopisemski stavek, ki se mora izpolniti." In veste, da bo šel naprej, "Začnimo s programom; vrzimo žreb in ugotovimo, kdo bo prevzel Judovo mesto." Čutim, da je bil Peter spet v mesu, manifestirajoč svojo naglico, ki je bila njegova narava. In mislim, da prihodnja zgodovina cerkve v knjigi Apostolska dela to kaže. Zanima me Petrovo razumevanje svetih spisov, kako citira iz toliko krajev v Stari zavezi. Peter kaže zelo veliko razumevanje Svetega pisma Stare zaveze, ki je točka v njegovo korist.<br/>Upoštevajte, da Peter pripisuje Svetemu Duhu tiste stvari, ki jih je napisal David. Tako, "Vse Sveto pismo je dano po navdihnjenju Boga" (2 Tim 3:16) . Ni del Svetega pisma. Ker, če mi poveste, da je del Svetega pisma podan po navdihnjenju Boga, potem vas moram vprašati: "Kateri deli so po navdihnjenju in kateri niso po navdihnjenju?" In potem si ti avtoriteta, ki mi pove, kateri del lahko verjamem in kateri del ne, in v trenutku, ko Bog ni več avtoriteta, ampak ti si avtoriteta, sem v težavah. Pazite se tistih, ki pravijo: "Ne morete verjeti vsemu, kar je zapisano v Svetem pismu!" In pravijo: "Vse, kar je zapisano, je od Boga navdihnjeno." In tu Luka v pisni obliki o tem, kar je govoril Peter, razglaša, da je bil David v resnici govornik Svetega Duha. Sveti Duh je po Davidovih ustih govoril o Judu.<br/>Kajti bil je prištet k nam, [je bil eden izmed dvanajstih] je dobil del te službe. Zdaj pa je ta človek kupil polje za plačilo za krivico; in padel na glavo (Apd 1,17-18),<br/>Kupil je polje, lončarjevo polje, kot pravi Zaharija v enajstem poglavju.<br/>Padel je na glavo in se raztrgal na sredini in vse njegovo črevo je izteklo (Apd 1,18).<br/>Obstajajo tisti, ki najdejo neskladje v Svetem pismu, kajti v enem od evangelijev nam je rečeno, da ko se je Juda vrnil in poskušal vrniti denar, so rekli: "Hej, to je vaš problem. Ne moremo ga vzeti." In ga vrniti v zakladnico templja. "To je krvavi denar." Potem ga je vrgel na tla templja in se obesil. Tukaj nam Peter pove, da je padel na glavo in se samo pojavil. In obstajajo tisti, ki si predstavljajo neskladje. Zelo preprosto je šel na drevo, da bi se obesil, privezal vrv okoli vratu in jo privezal na ud in skočil. In sila padca je bodisi zlomila vrv ali glavo, in padel je dol v kanjon in tako, kot je rekel tukaj.<br/>To je bilo znano vsem prebivalcem v Jeruzalemu, tako da se je polje v njihovem jeziku imenovalo Akeldama, kar pomeni: Polje krvi. Kajti pisano je v knjigi Psalmov: Naj bo njegovo prebivališče opustošeno in naj nihče ne prebiva v njem; in naj njegovo škofijo vzame drugi (Apd 1,19-20).<br/>Zdaj v resnici je citira iz dveh različnih psalmov tukaj. Iz Ps 69:25 , ga sestavi skupaj s Ps 109:8 . In dajanje obeh skupaj najde te prerokbe glede Juda.<br/>Zato ti možje (Apd 1,21)<br/>Tukaj iščejo nekoga, ki bi prevzel Judovo mesto za apostola. Tukaj so kvalifikacije, ki so jih iskali v tistem času.<br/>Zato so ti možje, ki so bili z nami ves čas, ko je Gospod Jezus prihajal in odhajal med nas (Apd 1,21),<br/>Sedaj se spomnite, da je bilo veliko učencev, od katerih je veliko učencev, ki jih je Jezus izbral deset za apostole. In beseda apostol pomeni "enega, ki je poslan." Ali izbral dvanajst, da so apostoli, tako da je poslal dvanajst. Število človeške vlade. "Imamo le enajst. Potrebujemo enega, da zavzame Judovo mesto, vendar potrebujemo enega, ki je bil z nami ves čas od začetka z Jezusom."<br/>Od dneva, ko je bil krščen po Janezu, do dneva, ko je bil vzet od nas, mora biti nekdo posvečen, da je priča njegovega vstajenja (Apd 1,22).<br/>To so torej bile zahteve, ki so jih iskali. Nekdo, ki je bil ves ta čas. Od časa Janezovega krsta do vnebohoda. In tisti, ki je videl vstalega Gospoda in bi tako lahko nosil dejstvo vstajenja, njihovo pričevanje o tem.<br/>Apostol Pavel je kasneje, ko je trdil, da je apostol, rekel: »Ali nisem videl vstalega Kristusa?« Očitno je bila to ena od zahtev apostolstva. Nekdo me je vprašal: »Ali so danes apostoli?« No, ne vem. Mislim, da ne obstajajo v istem pomenu, kot so bili v Novi zavezi. Zagotovo ni nihče danes, ki bi lahko pričeval o vstajenju, kot so to storili.<br/>In postavili sta dva, Jožefa, ki se je imenoval Barsaba, ki se je imenoval Just, in Mateja. In molili so in rekli: Ti, Gospod, ki poznaš srca vseh ljudi, pokaži, ali si od teh dveh, ki si jih izbral (Apd 1,23-24),<br/>Mislim, da pogosto naredimo to napako, da Gospodu damo dve izbiri, obe napačni. Omejitev Boga, vidite. Tako smo nagnjeni k temu. Očitno je, da je bil Pavel božja izbira. Peter je skočil s pištolo in rekel: "Hej, nekaj moramo storiti, veš, pomagati Bogu. Veš, eden je pogrešan in ga moramo napolniti." In vendar: "Bog, katerega od teh dveh hočeš?" In dal Bogu dve izbiri.<br/>da bi bil deležen te službe in tega apostolstva, iz katerega je padel Juda s prestopkom, da bi šel na svoje mesto. In tako so dali svoje žrebe (Dejanja 1:25-26);<br/>Zanimiv način, s katerim so poskušali določiti Božjo voljo. Vrzimo kocke, ugotovimo, kaj je Božja volja tukaj. Zanimivo mi je, različne načine, ki so jih ljudje izumili, da razločijo Božjo voljo. V starozaveznih časih so imeli zanimiv način, da pridejo k duhovniku, ki bi zanje vprašal Gospoda preko urima in tumima, "luči in popolnosti." Kaj so bili ti urima in tumima, ne vemo. Prepričan sem, da niso bila barvna očala, ki jih je Joseph Smith našel z zlatimi tablicami; čarobna očala, da ko jih namestite, lahko nenadoma preberete hieroglifsko pisavo.<br/>Obstajajo tisti, ki pravijo, da sta Urim in Thummim pravzaprav črno-bel kamen, ki se je nosil v vrečki na prsih duhovnika. Oni bi molili in vprašati Gospoda posebno vprašanje. Spomniš se, da je David spraševal GOSPODA: Gospod, ali naj gremo proti Filistejcem? Odgovor je bil: Ne! In zopet naslednji dan: Gospod, ali naj gremo proti Filistejcem? Odgovor je bil: Da. Kdaj naj gremo? Postavljali so posebna vprašanja in Gospod jih je vodil skozi urim in tumin. Pravijo, da bo duhovnik molil, iskal Boga, nato pa segel in izvlekel enega od dveh kamnov. Če je bil beli kamen, je bil odgovor da. Če bi bil ne, potem bi bil črni kamen, ki bi ga izvlekel. Nekateri celo pravijo, da dobimo izraz črna krogla iz tega Urima in Thummima. Pravzaprav je nazaj v izvirniku ne glas proti določenemu projektu ali ideji. Ne vemo, kakšna sta bila Urim in Thummim, toda v času Stare zaveze sta uporabljala metodo žrebanja, da bi določila Božjo voljo.<br/>Tako so tukaj učenci pobrali isto stvar, kot so vrgli kocke, da bi videli, kateri od dveh fantov, ki jih je Bog izbral, da nadomestijo Juda Iškariotskega.<br/>Žreb je padel na Mateja; bil je oštevilčen z enajstimi (Apd 1,26).<br/>Zdaj, kdo na svetu je Matthias? Nihče ni slišal za njega prej ali potem. To bo zanimivo, da izpolnjujejo Matthias in ugotovite, kdo je in kaj je storil. Mislim, da iz poznejše zgodovine, je očitno domnevati, da je Bog izbral Pavla kot apostola. Pavel to izjavlja sam. Zdaj je to zadnjič, ko beremo o njih, ki poskušajo razločiti Božjo voljo z žrebanjem ali po naključju neke vrste stvari.<br/>Danes poznam sodelavca, ki bo v prizadevanju, da bi razločil Gospodovo voljo, molil in Gospodu zastavil vprašanje. V žepu bo imel deset penijev in ko bo molil, jih bo vzel z zaprtimi očmi in jih dal na mizo, in če bodo vsi prišli na glavo, je to ja. Zanimivo je, da se občasno vsi pojavijo in to je precej dobra verjetnost. Vendar ne najdemo nobenega vzorca za to po tem, ko je bil dan Sveti Duh. Ko je Sveti Duh prišel na cerkev, potem Sveti Duh začel govoriti z njimi in jih usmeriti. In Sveti Duh je rekel, "Ločite mi Pavel in Barnaba za službo, kjer sem jih poklical" ( Act 13:2 ). In Sveti Duh jih je poslal. Tako smo ugotovili, da je cerkev bolj neposredno vodil Sveti Duh. Ko je Sveti Duh prišel, to metanje kocke, da bi ugotovili, Božja volja je bila odložena.<br/>"<br/><br/>Različica kralja Jamesa<br/><br/>To je različica Svetega pisma kralja Jakoba iz leta 1769 (znana tudi kot Pooblaščena različica). |

Yes that is correct, the Urbanears don't have a built in noise cancelling mic on the headphone itself but from what I can see there is a mic on the cable provided.<br/>1.

In fact, dynamic drivers work exactly the same as dynamic microphones but in reverse. Inside a dynamic driver there is a magnet, and when you plug in the headphones, you are sending a AC current through it which will turn the voice coil into a magnet. Depending on the direction of the current, the polarity of the magnet will change. Now since we know for a magnet, same charges repels and different charges attract, we know that the voice coil will move back and forth depending on it's polarity at the time. The voice coil is attached to the diaphragm which will then move back and forth creating a sound wave. The same occurs in reverse, if you move a coil through a magnet you produce a current instead. Since your voice is pushing the diaphragm, it is moving the voice coil back and forth generating the current you have observed.<br/><br/>100+ Head-Fier<br/><br/>Joined:<br/>Nov 7, 2011<br/><br/>Posts:<br/>134<br/><br/>Likes: 55<br/><br/>Exactly.

Stalin's opposition within the party, including Bukharin, Yagoda and Rykov were purged in these show trials, as Stalin manipulatively forced them to confess to crimes of planning a coup and opposing the state, even if there was no proof. Gabor T Rittersporn said, "Many of the victims were sincerely devoted to the principles of Bolshevism." This amplifies proof that the Bolshevik ideals that had once been the roots of the Communist Party were being disarranged and destroyed by the Purges. The party was depleted and former members helplessly watched Stalin use the great purge as a tool to transform Russia from a one party state to an unchallenged dictatorship. Again, the purges were shattering the framework of the Communist Party, formed during the Bolshevik revolution. This agrees with the "Stalin the executioner" source as both show the manipulative character, that helped the dictator to enhance his grip on Russia's throat.<br/>The manipulative manner, with which Stalin incriminated his targeted opposition during the purges, in the eyes of everyday Russians, also had an implosive impact on Soviet Society. Stalin was able to collect support from the people through his use of propaganda and the media to help him develop a "cult of personality" and the image of a heroic and brave leader. Through this support Stalin implanted mistrust into the minds of the people, convincing them that traitors of the revolution and what he described as 'enemies of the people', were amongst them.

Vendar pa je potencialno omejena v tem, da uporablja veliko primarnih podatkov, napisanih z očitnimi političnimi stališči in skritimi agendami.<br/>Stalin je povzročil politično uničenje boljševiške stranke.

Stalinovo opozicijo v stranki, vključno z Buharinom, Jagodo in Rykovom, so očistili na teh razstavnih sojenjih, saj jih je Stalin manipulativno prisilil, da priznajo zločine načrtovanja državnega udara in nasprotovanja državi, tudi če ni bilo dokazov. Gabor T. Rittersporn je dejal: "Mnoge žrtve so bile iskreno predane načelom boljševizma." To povečuje dokaz, da so boljševiške ideale, ki so nekoč bili korenine komunistične partije, čistile in uničevale. Stranka je bila izčrpana in nekdanji člani so nemočno gledali, kako Stalin uporablja veliko čistko kot orodje za preoblikovanje Rusije iz enopartijske države v nesporno diktaturo. Ponovno so čistke razbijale okvir komunistične partije, ki je nastala med boljševiško revolucijo. To se strinja z virom "Stalinovega kata", saj oba kažeta manipulativni značaj, ki je pomagal diktatorju okrepiti njegov oprijem na ruskem grlu.<br/>Manipulativni način, s katerim je Stalin obtožil svoje ciljno nasprotovanje med čistkami, je v očeh vsakdanjih Rusov prav tako imel imploziven vpliv na sovjetsko družbo. Stalin je bil sposoben zbrati podporo od ljudi s svojo uporabo propagande in medijev, da bi mu pomagali razviti "kult osebnosti" in podobo junaškega in pogumnega voditelja. S to podporo je Stalin vsadil nezaupanje v um ljudi in jih prepričal, da so med njimi izdajalci revolucije in tisti, ki jih je opisal kot "sovražnike ljudstva".

| Supercell is nerfing brawlers instead of nerfing star powers. I was at 750 last season with power 8 nita and it is very tough to go past that, like, star powers play a really dominant role. The matchmaking is also trash. When i play gem grab(around 600 trophies), there are often matchups where the enemy team has one more player than us who is maxed and it's not even that we have a lvl 9 to compete versus that. Sometimes there are even matchups where the enemy team is fully maxed and none of us are. this is why i dont play brawl stars seriously anymore. It's not even like there arent many players who are not maxed and around 600 trophies. It's annoying.<br/>Edit: I think supercell should have at least a basic mechanism that takes the average of levels of brawlers when setting up matches.<br/><br/>Except trophies don't really indicate your skill. They indicate the skill of the teammates you are placed with. And I'm fine with playing against higher level brawlers, but when one team is all level 10 and the other team isn't, clearly it's unbalanced.<br/><br/>I reccomend getting some good friends to play with, me and 2 friends got my friends power 1 tick to rank 28 by playing gem grab with a certain composition all day and we made it without a single one of us being maxed with our brawlers.<br/><br/>I Know how you feel I used to have brawlers in high trophies with low level and it's to difficult to go more further and everything I was saying to myself "I want to have star powers" really supercell needs to make balance to the star powers or at least make a better matchmaking system.<br/><br/>I kinda feel this. I ain't as good at the game as you, but I got Emz to 500 at power 1 and the matchmaking was horrible. Maxed out players everywhere! And it didn't help that the majority of my teammates had around 5-8k trophies... I had to resort to solo showdown last minute because I can either ambush unsuspecting players or simply play a little aggressive at the right times. But I really wish that it could be a bit easier for people who want to push brawlers to really high trophy ranges without having the luxury of star powers.<br/><br/>Altho spike is still good without curveball. Curveball was just a help for hitting your shots more often as spike. But even before curveball was released, spike was a really strong brawler, so he will remain the same now.<br/><br/>I agree that they should have nerfed ambush, but I think they are trying to balance both Snappy Sniping and Ambush, as they are both getting merged with this change. She was becoming a little powerful, but still not nerf-worthy<br/><br/>I'm not sure about this, but now that Darryl got a noticeable buff, looking at their new stats, it looks like Darryl might overshadow Bull, as not only he can always deal more damage than Bull, he won't die as early anymore, so their survivability will be similar without star power (although Bull's survivability is still noticeably better than Darryl's if he had Tough Guy). Not only that, Darryl's super can auto regenerate, meaning Darryl MIGHT be able to be played effectively both as a heavyweight AND an assassin at the same time (before he sucks as a heavyweight but decent as an assassin)<br/><br/>But hes overrated af. And you get trophies with him really easily. So im kinda ok with the nerf. I havent even played him since when I got him to 500 (around 5 months ago), so not that I care that much either.<br/><br/>Why doesn't Poco/Penny get a HP nerf, if they are Marksman/Healer respectively not a tank?<br/>Why isn't Rosa's tankyness nerfed, cough 70% damage reduction?<br/>Why is Tick allowed to have the highest range and the most free pokedamage in the entire game?<br/>Why doesn't Leon get a HP/Damage buff?<br/><br/>Be that as it may, it was Ambush that was OP, not base Piper. I would argue that Ambush is the best star power in the game (now even more so since the percentage of damage increase indirectly went up) and base Piper was a bottom-10 brawler.<br/><br/>What Supercell should do is revert both nerfs, reduce Ambush to 600, and reduce Snappy Sniping to 0.25 since it'd be indirectly buffed by the base damage buff.<br/><br/>Yea and I believe they went a bit too far with Rosa, because now she is basically the better bull now when it comes to tanking, which she has been for a while. Now, Darryl might as well be a smaller, more powerful bull<br/><br/>Why? I feel she needs a buff in almost everything except her star power. Her health and speed make her super a bit more difficult to use, because she can die pretty easily, and it is really difficult for her to trap faster brawlers like Crow. Her star power is a bit broken though... | Supercell je živčni pretepači namesto živčnih zvezdnih moči. Bil sem na 750 v prejšnji sezoni z močjo 8 nita in zelo težko je iti mimo tega, da imajo zvezdne moči resnično prevladujočo vlogo. Matchmaking je tudi smeti. Ko igram dragulj grab (okoli 600 trofeje), so pogosto tekme, kjer ima sovražna ekipa enega igralca več kot mi, ki je maxed in to ni niti, da imamo lvl 9 tekmovati proti temu. Včasih so celo tekme, kjer je sovražnik ekipa v celoti maxed in nihče od nas so. to je razlog, zakaj ne igrajo pretepu zvezde resno več. To ni niti, kot da ni veliko igralcev, ki niso maxed in okoli 600 trofeje. To je nadležno.<br/>Edit: Mislim, da bi morala supercelica imeti vsaj osnovni mehanizem, ki pri nastavljanju tekem vzame povprečje ravni pretepačev.<br/><br/>Razen trofeje dejansko ne kažejo vaše spretnosti. Označujejo spretnosti soigralcev, s katerimi ste postavljeni. In jaz sem v redu z igranjem proti višji ravni pretepačev, ampak ko je ena ekipa je vse ravni 10 in druga ekipa ni, očitno je, da je neuravnoteženo.<br/><br/>Priporočam, da dobite nekaj dobrih prijateljev, s katerimi se lahko igrate, jaz in 2 prijatelja sta dobila moje prijatelje moč 1 klop, da se uvrsti na 28 z igranjem dragulja z določeno sestavo ves dan in to smo naredili brez enega od nas, ki je bil maxed z našimi pretepači.<br/><br/>Vem, kako se počutite, da sem imel pretepače v visokih trofejah z nizko stopnjo in da je težko iti dlje in vse, kar sem si rekel "Želim imeti zvezdne moči", resnično supercell mora uravnotežiti zvezdne moči ali vsaj narediti boljši sistem matchmakinga.<br/><br/>Nekako se počutim tako. Nisem tako dober v igri kot ti, vendar sem dobil Emz na 500 na moči 1 in matchmaking je bil grozen. Povsod so igralci! In to ni pomagalo, da je večina mojih soigralcev imela okoli 5-8k trofeje ... Moral sem se zateči k solo obračunu v zadnjem trenutku, ker lahko bodisi zasedem nič sumljive igralce ali pa preprosto igram malo agresivno ob pravem času. Ampak resnično si želim, da bi bilo lahko malo lažje za ljudi, ki želijo potisniti pretepače na resnično visoke trofeje, ne da bi imeli razkošje zvezdnih moči.<br/><br/>Altho spike je še vedno dober brez curveballa. Curveball je bil samo pomoč pri pogostejšem udarjanju vaših posnetkov kot spike. Toda še preden je bil curveball izdan, je bil spike res močan pretepač, zato bo zdaj ostal enak.<br/><br/>Strinjam se, da bi morali imeti živčno zasedo, vendar mislim, da poskušajo uravnotežiti tako Snappy Sniping kot Ambush, saj se oba združujeta s to spremembo. Postajala je malo močna, vendar še vedno ni živčna vredna<br/><br/>Nisem prepričan o tem, toda zdaj, ko je Darryl dobil opazno buff, gleda na njihove nove statistike, se zdi, da bi Darryl lahko zasenčil Bulla, saj ne samo, da lahko vedno povzroči več škode kot Bull, ne bo umrl tako zgodaj, tako da bo njihova preživetost podobna brez zvezdne moči (čeprav je preživetje Bulla še vedno opazno boljše kot Darryl, če bi imel T Guya). Ne samo to, da se Darrylov super lahko samodejno regenerira, kar pomeni, da se Darryl lahko učinkovito igra tako kot težka kategorija in morilec hkrati (preden je zanič kot težka kategorija, vendar dostojno kot morilec)<br/><br/>Ampak on je precenjen af. In dobiš trofeje z njim res enostavno. Torej sem nekako v redu z živcem. Nisem ga niti igral, saj sem ga dobil na 500 (okoli 5 mesecev nazaj), tako da ne, da mi ni mar, da preveč.<br/><br/>Zakaj Poco/Penny ne dobi HP živca, če so Marksman/Healer oziroma ne tank?<br/>Zakaj Rosina tankičnost ni živčna, kašelj 70% zmanjšanje škode?<br/>Zakaj je Tick dovoljeno imeti najvišji razpon in najbolj brezplačno pokedamage v celotni igri?<br/>Zakaj Leon ne dobi HP/Damage buffa?<br/><br/>Kakorkoli že, to je bila zaseda, ki je bila OP, ne baza Piper. Trdil bi, da je Ambush najboljša zvezdna moč v igri (zdaj še bolj, ker se je odstotek povečanja škode posredno povečal) in baza Piper je bila spodnja 10 pretepač.<br/><br/>Supercell bi morala obrniti oba živca, zmanjšati Ambush na 600 in zmanjšati Snappy Sniping na 0,25, saj bi ga posredno nadomeščala osnovna škoda.<br/><br/>Z Roso sva šla malo predaleč, ker je zdaj v bistvu boljši bik, ko gre za tankiranje, kar je že nekaj časa.<br/><br/>Zakaj? Čutim, da potrebuje buff v skoraj vsem, razen njene zvezde moči. Njeno zdravje in hitrost jo super malo težje za uporabo, ker lahko umre precej enostavno, in to je res težko zanjo, da ujame hitrejše pretepače, kot so Crow. Njena zvezda moč je malo pokvarjena, čeprav ... |

| Self-Employment Part 1<br/><br/>When you accept an employment in any organisation, you have to perform various jobs as per the requirements of your employer and you may get a fixed amount of income as salary. You may run a small retail shop, tailoring shop, restaurant, bakery and confectionery, beauty salon, etc. in your locality. You may get engaged in trading or manufacturing on a small scale or providing some service for a price. Such economic activities are known as self-employment.<br/><br/>Meaning of Self-Employment<br/><br/>Earning is necessary for a living. Our father, mother, brothers, sisters and others may be engaged in different economic activities through which they earn their livelihood. These persons are engaged in an economic activity which is termed as wage employment or paid employment. But there are many persons who engage themselves in an occupation or some business which they start and manage on their own. They put in their best effort and take all types of risks to pursue their careers successfully. The entire earning of their work goes to them. All of us have seen small grocery shops, tailoring shops, medical stores etc. in our locality. These are owned and managed by a person, with or without the help of some assistants. Their economic activities are termed as self-employment.

Thus, self-employment may provide employment to other persons as well.<br/><br/>The earning from self-employment is not fixed. It depends on the income one can earn by producing or buying and selling goods or providing services to others at a price.<br/><br/>In self-employment, the owner alone has to take the profit and bear the risk of loss. So, we find a direct link between the effort and reward in self-employment.<br/><br/>It requires some amount of capital investment, although it may be small.<br/><br/>In self-employment, a person is free to take decisions in respect of running his business profitably and avail of any opportunity that may come up for expansion of his business. It gives complete freedom to work as per one's own will and within the parameters of the prevailing laws.<br/><br/>Thus, self-employment may be defined as, an economic activity which one may perform on his own as a gainful occupation, and this may consist of producing and selling goods, buying and selling goods, or rendering services for a price. | Samozaposlitev 1. del<br/><br/>Ko sprejmete zaposlitev v kateri koli organizaciji, morate opravljati različna delovna mesta v skladu z zahtevami vašega delodajalca in lahko dobite določen znesek dohodka kot plačo.
