The ambiguity arises from the fact that static pressure can be used, correctly, to refer to the free-stream pressure in external flows, but it is more often, and not always correctly, used to refer to the pressure in a generic point of a flow field, typically when discussing the Bernoulli equation. In order to avoid ambiguity, alternative expressions that could be used, depending on the context, are free-stream pressure, fluid pressure, thermodynamic pressure or often just pressure.<br/><br/>Equivalence of static and free-stream pressure<br/><br/>We consider as an example the atmosphere, at rest relatively to the ground. An observer standing on the ground would see a generic fluid element as not moving, and subject to the local static pressure (which, in this case, is the atmospheric pressure).<br/>We now consider an aircraft that flies straight and level with speed (airspeed and ground speed are the same, in this example), approaching the same fluid element from great distance. The distance is such that the fluid element is not perturbed by the approaching aircraft. To an observer on board the aircraft, the fluid element, like all the fluid elements at the same distance, appears as being in free-stream conditions, where all the fluid elements flow straight towards the aircraft with the same constant velocity and there are no pressure gradients inside the fluid (that is the pressure is constant anywhere in that region of fluid).[4] Given that the fluid element is the same for both observers, so is the pressure to which the element is subject, therefore what an observer at rest calls static pressure is in fact the free-stream pressure to an observer moving relatively to the fluid. This is the only case in fluid dynamics where, strictly speaking, the expression static pressure can be used appropriately[citation needed], i.e. to refer to the free-stream pressure.<br/>Note that when the fluid element comes in proximity to the aircraft, free-stream conditions are lost, its velocity changes and pressure gradients develop. The pressure exerted on the element, therefore, will not be, in general, equal to the static pressure anymore.<br/><br/>Static pressure and the Bernoulli equation<br/><br/>The Bernoulli equation, assuming incompressible, inviscid flow and negligible gravitational effects, can be written as follows:<br/><br/>Since the term ρv2 / 2 is, by definition, the so-called dynamic pressure, the term p, by contrast, is usually named static pressure although it may, or may not, refer to the above mentioned free-stream pressure. The two possible cases are:<br/><br/>Bernoulli equation referred to free-stream conditions – When the Bernoulli equation is applied to a point of the flow field far upstream of any object, both pressure and velocity take their respective free-stream values and , therefore the Bernoulli equation can be correctly read as "the sum of static pressure and (free-stream) dynamic pressure is constant across the flow field".<br/><br/>Bernoulli equation referred to a generic point – When the Bernoulli equation is written for a generic point A of the flow field, for example a point close to an airfoil, the value of the fluid pressure pA is in general different from the free-stream one, and, strictly speaking, the term should not be referred to as static pressure. The Bernoulli equation could be correctly read, for example, as "the sum of fluid pressure in A and dynamic pressure in A is constant across the flow field". Nevertheless it is very common to refer to the non-velocity-dependent term of the Bernoulli equation as static pressure anyway, regardless of whether it is applied to free-stream conditions or not.<br/><br/>The two cases can be summarized by applying the Bernoulli equation to different points of the flow field: a point far upstream, a generic point close to a body and, for completeness, a stagnation point on the body's surface:<br/><br/>where:<br/><br/>= free-stream (static) pressure<br/><br/>ρ = fluid density (assumed constant)<br/><br/>= free-stream velocity<br/><br/>p = fluid pressure in a generic point<br/><br/>v = velocity in a generic point<br/><br/>pS = stagnation (or total) pressure<br/><br/>See also<br/><br/>References<br/><br/>^ There are only a few areas (e.g. some parts of the fuselage or along the outside of a Pitot tube) where the pressure exerted is equal to the static pressure; those are the places where static ports are located.<br/><br/>^ A pressure gradient would in fact cause an acceleration, and so the velocity would not be constant anymore. Note also that we are neglecting the variation of atmospheric pressure with altitude. | Vsebina<br/><br/>Statični tlak v dinamiki tekočine<br/><br/>Uporaba izraza statični tlak v dinamiki tekočine je zelo pogosta, čeprav lahko privede do dvoumnosti. Dvosmiselnost izhaja iz dejstva, da se lahko statični tlak pravilno uporablja za sklicevanje na tlak prostega toka v zunanjih tokovih, vendar se pogosteje in ne vedno pravilno uporablja za sklicevanje na tlak v generični točki polja pretoka, običajno pri razpravi o Bernoullijevi enačbi. Da bi se izognili dvoumnosti, so alternativni izrazi, ki bi jih lahko uporabili, odvisno od konteksta, tlak prostega toka, tlak tekočine, termodinamični tlak ali pogosto samo tlak.<br/><br/>Enakovrednost statičnega tlaka in tlaka prostega toka<br/><br/>Opazovalec, ki stoji na tleh, bi videl generični fluidni element kot nepremičen in odvisen od lokalnega statičnega tlaka (ki je v tem primeru atmosferski tlak).<br/>Zdaj upoštevamo letalo, ki leti naravnost in ravnino s hitrostjo (hitrost zraka in hitrost tal sta enaka, v tem primeru), ki se približuje istemu fluidnemu elementu z velike razdalje. Razdalja je takšna, da fluidni element ne moti prihajajočega letala. Opazovalcu na krovu letala se zdi, da je fluidni element, tako kot vsi fluidni elementi na isti razdalji, v pogojih prostega toka, kjer vsi fluidni elementi tečejo naravnost proti letalu z enako konstantno hitrostjo in znotraj tekočine ni gradientov tlaka (tj. tlak je stalen kjerkoli v tem območju tekočine). To je edini primer v dinamiki tekočine, kjer se lahko, strogo gledano, ustrezno uporabi izraz statični tlak, tj. za sklicevanje na tlak prostega toka.<br/>Upoštevajte, da ko fluidni element pride v bližino letala, se izgubijo pogoji prostega toka, spremeni se njegova hitrost in razvijejo se gradienti tlaka. Tlak, ki se izvaja na elementu, zato na splošno ne bo več enak statičnemu tlaku.<br/><br/>Statični tlak in Bernoullijeva enačba<br/><br/>Bernoullijevo enačbo, ob predpostavki nestisljivega, nevidnega toka in zanemarljivih gravitacijskih učinkov, lahko zapišemo na naslednji način:<br/><br/>Ker je izraz ρv2 / 2 po definiciji tako imenovani dinamični tlak, se izraz p, nasprotno, običajno imenuje statični tlak, čeprav se lahko ali ne, nanaša na zgoraj omenjeni tlak prostega toka. Možna dva primera sta:<br/><br/>Bernoullijeva enačba se nanaša na pogoje prostega toka - Ko se Bernoullijeva enačba uporabi za točko pretočnega polja, ki je daleč nad katerim koli predmetom, tako tlak kot hitrost prevzameta svoje ustrezne vrednosti prostega toka in zato se lahko Bernoullijeva enačba pravilno bere kot "vsota statičnega tlaka in dinamičnega tlaka (prostega toka) je konstantna skozi polje pretočnega polja".<br/><br/>Bernoullijeva enačba se nanaša na generično točko - Ko je Bernoullijeva enačba napisana za generično točko A polja pretoka, na primer točko blizu zračnega lista, je vrednost tlaka tekočine pA na splošno drugačna od prostega pretoka in, strogo rečeno, izraz se ne bi smel nanašati na statični tlak. Bernoullijevo enačbo bi lahko pravilno brali, na primer, kot "vsota tlaka tekočine v A in dinamičnega tlaka v A je konstantna čez polje pretoka". Kljub temu je zelo pogosto, da se izraz Bernoullijeve enačbe, ki ni odvisen od hitrosti, vseeno nanaša na statični tlak, ne glede na to, ali se uporablja za pogoje prostega toka ali ne.<br/><br/>Oba primera lahko povzamemo z uporabo Bernoullijeve enačbe na različnih točkah pretočnega polja: točka daleč navzgor, generična točka blizu telesa in, za popolnost, točka stagnacije na površini telesa:<br/><br/>kjer:<br/><br/>= prosti tok (statični) tlak<br/><br/>ρ = gostota tekočine (predpostavljena konstanta)<br/><br/>= hitrost prostega toka<br/><br/>p = tlak tekočine v generični točki<br/><br/>v = hitrost v generični točki<br/><br/>pS = stagnacija (ali skupni) tlak<br/><br/>Glej tudi<br/><br/>Reference<br/><br/>↑ Obstaja le nekaj področij (npr. nekateri deli trupa ali vzdolž zunanje strani Pitotove cevi), kjer je tlak enak statičnemu tlaku; to so mesta, kjer se nahajajo statična vrata.<br/><br/>^ Tlačni gradient bi dejansko povzročil pospešek, zato hitrost ne bi bila več konstantna. Upoštevajte tudi, da zanemarjamo spremembo atmosferskega tlaka z nadmorsko višino. |
