Undocumented migrants have nothing. They are not allowed to work. They have no right to state benefits nor to a place to live. They are unseen and potentially the most vulnerable group in the UK today.<br/><br/>Undocumented (or irregular) migrants include those trafficked into the sex trade or for domestic servitude; they include visa overstayers; those whose asylum applications have been refused and others who have been subject to failures in the immigration system. All of these may originally have come to the UK legally.<br/><br/>'Illegal immigrants' – those imagined to have entered the country in the backs of lorries – make up a small proportion of the undocumented.<br/><br/>Indeed some sources suggest that half the estimated 120,000 undocumented children in the UK were actually born here to undocumented parents. These children are disadvantaged from birth, solely by their immigration status.<br/><br/>The blog tells the stories of the undocumented. It highlights their daily struggles and vulnerabilities, but also their strength and resilience. It's not an easy read.<br/><br/>You can access the blog via our website (bottom of right hand column on Home Page).<br/><br/>The blog has won the online category of the Speaking Together media awards. The awards were a new addition this year to the Migrant and Refugee Woman of the Year Awards celebration at the Royal Festival Hall in London as part of International Women's Day. The panel of judges – including novelist and playwright Gillian Slovo, and journalist and author, Hannah Pool – was particularly looking for work that challenged myths and stereotypes.<br/><br/>The blog has also won the Blog North Awards 2013 in the Best Writing category and was also shortlisted for an Amnesty International Media Award. | Navigacija po prispevkih<br/><br/>"Življenje brez dokumentov" osvojil nagrado za najboljše pisanje<br/><br/>Blog projekt "Življenje brez dokumentov", ki ga je ustvaril Len Grant, vsebuje zgodbe o družinah migrantov brez dokumentov in mladih. Nedokumentirani migranti nimajo ničesar. Ne smejo delati. Nimajo pravice do državnih dajatev niti do kraja za življenje. Danes so najbolj ranljiva in potencialno najbolj ranljiva skupina v Združenem kraljestvu.<br/><br/>Nedokumentirani (ali neregularni) migranti vključujejo tiste, s katerimi se trguje v trgovini s seksom ali za domače suženjstvo; vključujejo osebe, ki so presegle vizumsko dovoljenje; tiste, katerih prošnje za azil so bile zavrnjene, in druge, ki so bile predmet neuspeha v priseljenskem sistemu. Vse to je lahko prvotno prišlo v Veliko Britanijo zakonito.<br/><br/>"Nezakoniti priseljenci" - tisti, za katere se domneva, da so vstopili v državo na hrbtu tovornjakov - predstavljajo majhen delež tistih, ki nimajo dokumentov.<br/><br/>Dejansko nekateri viri kažejo, da se je polovica od ocenjenih 120.000 otrok brez dokumentov v Združenem kraljestvu dejansko rodila tukaj staršem brez dokumentov. Ti otroci so prikrajšani od rojstva, samo zaradi njihovega priseljenskega statusa.<br/><br/>Blog pripoveduje zgodbe nedokumentiranih. Poudarja njihove vsakodnevne borbe in ranljivosti, pa tudi njihovo moč in odpornost.

| Sabbath School Lesson<br/><br/>In Galatians, Paul tackles issues such as freedom, the role of the law in salvation, our condition in Christ, and the nature of the Spirit-led life, as well as the age-old question, How can sinful humans be made right before a holy and just God?<br/><br/>Many scholars believe that Galatians may be the earliest of Paul's letters. It was written in A.D. 49, shortly after the famous Jerusalem Council (Acts 15). Therefore, the book may be the oldest Christian document known. As Acts and Galatians make clear, the early church found itself in a fierce battle over the nature of salvation, especially in the case of Gentiles. According to a group of Jewish believers, known as Judaizers, belief in Jesus alone was not good enough for Gentiles. Gentiles must also be circumcised and follow the laws of Moses (Acts 15:1).<br/><br/>This quarter's Bible study guide invites us to journey with the apostle Paul as he pleads with the Galatians to remain true to Jesus. It also gives us a chance to reflect on our own understanding of the truths that opened the way for Martin Luther's ultimate break with Rome and the restoration of the biblical gospel. | Sabbath šola Lekcija<br/><br/>V Listu Galačanom se Pavel ukvarja z vprašanji, kot so svoboda, vloga postave pri odrešitvi, naše stanje v Kristusu in narava življenja, ki ga vodi Duh, pa tudi s starodavnim vprašanjem: Kako lahko grešni ljudje postanejo pravični pred svetim in pravičnim Bogom?<br/><br/>Mnogi učenjaki menijo, da so Galačani morda najzgodnejši od Pavlovih pisem. Napisana je bila v AD 49, kmalu po znameniti Jeruzalemski koncil (Apostolska dela 15). Zato je knjiga lahko najstarejši znani krščanski dokument. Kot pojasnjujejo Apostolska dela in Galačanom, se je zgodnja cerkev znašla v ostrem boju glede narave odrešenja, še posebej v primeru poganov. Po mnenju skupine judovskih vernikov, znanih kot Judaizers, vera v Jezusa sama po sebi ni bila dovolj dobra za pogane. Tudi pogani morajo biti obrezani in slediti Mojzesovim zakonom (Apostolska dela 15:1).<br/><br/>Vodnik za preučevanje Biblije v tej četrtini nas vabi, da potujemo z apostolom Pavlom, ko prosi Galačane, naj ostanejo zvesti Jezusu. Prav tako nam daje priložnost, da razmislimo o našem lastnem razumevanju resnic, ki so odprle pot Martinu Lutherju za končni prelom z Rimom in obnovo svetopisemskega evangelija. |

Bavarskim, Charlotte Luise Frederique Amalie Alexandrine, poročena 24. junija 1814 z Wilhelmom, vojvodo Nassau. Franz Friedrich Karl Ludwig Georg Heinrich, Friedrich Wilhelm Karl Joseph Ludwig Georg. Friedrich je veljal za priljubljenega in inteligentnega, v času njegove vladavine, skupaj s svojo lepo ženo Charlotte, je kulturno življenje v majhnem mestu doseglo svoj zenit. Toliko pesnikov in umetnikov je preživelo svoj čas tam, da je bil Hildburghausen vzdevek Klein-Weimar, ko je zadnji vojvoda Saško-Gotha-Altenburg umrl brez vprašanja leta 1825, so se druge veje hiše odločile za preureditev Ernestinskih vojvodstev. 12. novembra 1826 je Friderik postal vojvoda Saško-Altenburgski, kateremu je leta 1831 dal prvi temeljni zakon, v zameno za medije, povezane s Friderikom, vojvodo Saško-Altenburgskim na Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>Friderik, vojvoda Saško-Altenburgski<br/>–Super.<br/>Frederick<br/><br/>Petnajst.<br/>vojvodinja Charlotte Georgine Mecklenburg-Strelitz<br/>–Super.<br/>Charlotte Georgine se je rodila v Hannovru, elektoratu Brunswick-Lüneburg. Bila je najstarejši otrok in hči Karla II., velikega vojvode Mecklenburga, Charlotte in njene sestre, kraljica Louise Pruska, kraljica Frederica Hannoverska in princesa Therese Thurn und Taxis, so veljale za najlepše ženske svojega časa. Jean Paul Friedrich Richter je svoj roman Titan posvetil štirim lepim, Charlotte je odraščala v Hannoveru, kjer je njen oče služil kot guverner, v imenu njegovega zeta, kralja Georgea III., ki je živel v Londonu. Ko je bila Charlotte stara dvanajst let, je umrla njena mati in vzgojila jo je sestra njene matere, Charlotte, ki se je poročila z njenim očetom leta 1784, njene sestre pa je pripeljala njena babica, Maria Louise Albertine iz Leiningen-Falkenburg-Dagsburga v Darmstadtu. Charlotte se je 3. septembra 1785 pri petnajstih letih poročila z vojvodo Friderikom, vojvodo Saško-Altenburgskim, zakon ni bil srečen, Charlotte je bila duševno boljša od Friderika, ki jo je začel ignorirati. Imeli so tudi težave, Saško-Hildburghausen je bil finančno uničen zaradi katastrofalne politike Fredericksovih predhodnikov. Prejemniki so dovolili vojvodi in vojvodinji le zmanjšano civilno listo, Charlottin oče in dva brata sta pogosto ostala pri Charlotti v Hildburghausenu. Leta 1787 se je preselila v Hildburghausen in postala predsednica kreditnega odbora. Leta 1792 so Charlottina babica in njene sestre pobegnile pred napredujočo francosko vojsko iz Darmstadta v Hildburghausen in njena babica je opazila Charlottinega moža. Od vseh svojih dolžnosti je goreče opravljal svoje zakonske dolžnosti. Charlotte, ki ni nikoli ljubila tega moškega, je vedno noseča, družina je preživela nekaj brezskrbnih tednov v Hildburghausenu. Leta 1793 se je Charlottina babica vrnila iz izgnanstva in potovala s Charlottinimi sestrami v Frankfurt na Majni, Charlotte pa je imela zelo intimen in ljubeč odnos s svojo sestro Friederike in sorodniki v Strelitzu. Leta 1803 in 1805 je pruski kraljevi par obiskal Hildburghausen, za to priložnost pa so prejemniki dovolili vojvodskemu paru, da obnovi nekaj svojega pohištva. Louise je pomagala pripraviti razglasitev vojne, Christian Truchseß von Wetzhausen zu Bettenburg je bil prijatelj vojvodskega para in boter Charlottinega sina Edwarda. Številni gledalci so prišli k bavarski kronski princesi, ko je Truchseß sprejel svoje goste, je najprej poskušal pripeljati nižje uvrščeno Charlotte v svoj grad, vendar je zavrnila, sklicujoč se na svojo hčerko. Truchseß je odgovoril: "Vaše visočanstvo mi bo oprostilo, toda dokler je ta grad stal tukaj, je Terezija zgrabila barone za drugo roko in vsi trije so skupaj šli skozi vrata." Vojvodinja je dala približno polovico svojega dohodka revnim, upokojencem.<br/><br/>1617.<br/>Karel Hesensko-Kasselski<br/>–Super.<br/>Princ Karel Hessensko-Kasselski je bil kadet v rodbini Hessensko-Kasselskih in danski generalni feldmaršal. Odraščal je pri sorodnikih na danskem dvoru, večino svojega življenja je preživel na Danskem, njegova mati pa je bila hči kralja Jurija II. Velike Britanije in Caroline Ansbach ter sestra danske kraljice Louise. Njegov oče, bodoči grof, je družino zapustil leta 1747, leta 1755 pa je uradno prekinil zakon z Marijo. Dedek, Viljem VIII., deželni grof Hessen, je podelil grofijo Hanau in njene prihodke Mariji, mlademu princu Charlesu in njegovima dvema bratoma, Viljemu in Frideriku, ki ju je vzgajala mati in vzgajala protestantska sorodnika od leta 1747. Leta 1756 se je Marija preselila na Dansko, da bi skrbela za mladoletne otroke svoje sestre, danske kraljice Louise. S seboj je vzela svoje sinove, ki so bili vzgojeni na dvoru v palači Christiansborg v Københavnu. Hesijski knezi so kasneje ostali na Danskem in postali njeni pomembni gospodarji, le najstarejši brat Viljem se je leta 1785 po nastopu deželne grofije vrnil v Hessen. Karel je začel kariero na Danskem. Leta 1758 je bil imenovan za polkovnika, v starosti 20 let je bil tudi leta 1766 imenovan za generalnega guvernerja Norveške, položaj je imel do leta 1768, vendar je ostal večinoma naslov, saj v tem obdobju ni nikoli odšel na Norveško. Leta 1763 se je njegov starejši brat William poročil s svojim prvim bratrancem, Karel pa je 30. avgusta 1766 sledil njegovemu vzoru v palači Christiansborg – njegova žena je bila Louise Danska, kar je Charlesu omogočilo, da je postal svak njegovega bratranca, kralja Christiana VII. Poroka je potekala kljub nasvetom, ki so bili dani proti njej, zaradi obtožb o razuzdanosti s strani princa Charlesa. Kmalu zatem je Charles padel na dvoru in v začetku leta 1767 sta imela prvega otroka, Marie Sophie, tam leta 1767 in nato drugega otroka, Williama, leta 1769. Leta 1768 je Charles kupil posest in vas Offenbach-Rumpenheim od družine Edelsheim. Leta 1771 je dvorec razširil v grad in knežev sedež, njegova mati Marija pa je živela v palači do svoje smrti leta 1772. Leta 1781 je Karel prodal palačo Rumpenheim svojemu mlajšemu bratu, zato se je s svojo družino preselil v grad Gottorp v Schleswigu. Tam sta imela tretjega otroka Friderika leta 1771, leta 1770 pa je kralj Christian VII. dal svoji sestri posest Tegelhof v Gübyju med mestoma Schleswig in Eckernförde. Med letoma 1772 in 1776 je Charles imel poletno rezidenco zgrajeno na mestu, ki ga je poimenoval Louisenlund v čast svoje žene, septembra 1772 pa je bil Charles imenovan za vrhovnega poveljnika norveške vojske in se je z Louise preselil v Christiano. Dodelitev je bila posledica državnega udara švedskega kralja Gustava III. 19. avgusta 1772, medtem ko je na Norveškem princesa Louise rodila četrtega otroka Juliane leta 1773.<br/><br/>Osemnajst.<br/>Louise Caroline Hesse-Kassel<br/>–Super.<br/>Louise Caroline se je rodila v Gottorpu v vojvodini Schleswig Landgraufu Charlesu Hesse-Kasselskem in njegovi ženi princesi Louisi Danski.

Šteje se, da je ustanovitelj Casa dEste, saj je bil glava prve družine, ki je bila gospodar Esteja, Alberto Azzo II. je bil edini sin Alberta Azzo I., markiza Milana. Okoli leta 1020 je podedoval svoje očetovske pisarne in nenehno povečeval svoje posestvo v severni Italiji, leta 1069-1070 je poskušal pridobiti Maine za svojega sina Hugha, ker je bila njegova žena Garsende sodedinja prejšnjih grofov Maine. Hugh je bil razglašen za grofa, vendar ni mogel premagati Roberta, vojvode Normandije, v investiturnem sporu med Henrikom IV., svetim rimskim cesarjem in papežem Gregorjem VII., Azzo je poskušal posredovati, vendar se je kasneje pridružil papežu. Okoli leta 1073 je naredil grad v Esteju svojo rezidenco, iz katere je bila hiša Esteja pred njegovim gradbenim projektom malo več kot vas. Njegov sin Welf se je najprej preselil v Koroško, nato pa na Bavarsko, kar je povzročilo nastanek ene najpomembnejših družin v evropski zgodovini, drugi sin, Fulk I. Milanski, je prvič dokumentirano uporabil naziv markiz dEste. Azzo II. se je poročil s hčerko Welfa II., grofa Altdorfa, in imel enega znanega otroka, Welfskega vojvodo Bavarskega od leta 1070 do 1077 in od leta 1096 do njegove smrti, ki je bil prvi član Welfske veje dinastije Este. Njegova druga poroka je bila z Garsende, hčerko Herberta I., grofa Maine, in imela sta naslednje znane sinove, Fulca I., markiza Milana, prednika italijanske veje hiše Este Hugha V., grofa Maine, ni imela nobenih težav. Nekateri viri pravijo, da se je poročil tudi z Vitalijo Orseolo, hčerko Petra Orseola in je imel zunajzakonsko razmerje z Matildo, sestro Viljema, škofa Padove, s katero je imel hčerko po imenu Adelasia, ki se je poročila z Guglielmo Adelardi.

Bil je prvi član Welfove veje hiše Este, v genealogiji starejše hiše Welf pa se šteje kot Welf IV. Welf je bil sin Azza II. iz Esteja in njegove žene Kunigunde iz Altdorfa, ko je Welfov stric po materi Welf, vojvoda Koroške, umrl brez otrok, Welf pa je podedoval njegovo premoženje. Welf se je poročil z Ethelinde Northeimsko, hčerko Otta II., vojvode Bavarskega, ko je njegov tast, vojvoda Otto, postal sovražnik kralja Henrika IV. in izgubil njegovo vojvodstvo, je Welf ostal zvest kralju. V skladu s Henrikovimi ukazi je zapustil in se ločil od svoje vojvodinje Ethelinde in ta dogodek se je zgodil v Goslaru leta 1070, ko so se bavarske zvezne države tiho podredile na novo ustanovljenemu vojvodi, ki je bil predstavnik ene najstarejših družin v provinci. Njegova zavrnitev vojvodinje, ki bi jo lahko obravnavali kot dejanje krivice. Papež in cesar sta se površinsko uskladila leta 1076, vendar je leto ponovno videlo, da sta se ukvarjala z aktivnimi sovražnostmi. Henrik je zaradi ponavljajočih se uporniških dejanj razglasil Welfa za odstavljenega v svojem na novo pridobljenem vojvodstvu. Vendar pa je Welf, ki so ga podpirali njegovi zvesti Bavarci in mu je pomagal njegov oče v Italiji, lahko ohranil svoje mesto, vendar je Grgur umrl leta 1085 in njegovi nasledniki so imeli manj intenzivno vlogo v zadevah Nemčije. Welf, čeprav se je še vedno držal cerkvene stranke, se je po ločitvi leta 1070 od svoje prve žene poročil z Judith Flandrijsko, hčerko Baldwina IV., grofa Flandrije, in vdovo Tostiga Godwinsona, grofa Northumbrije. Leta 1089 se je Welfov sin Welf poročil z Matildo Toskansko, s čimer je okrepil odnose s papežem, vendar se je po tem, ko se je mlajša Welfka ločila od Matilde leta 1095, Welf oddolžil kralju Henriku IV. in bil ponovno potrjen kot vojvoda Bavarske. Po smrti očeta Azza leta 1097 je Welf poskušal pridobiti očetovo posest južno od Alp, leta 1099 pa se je Welf pridružil križarski vojni leta 1101, skupaj z Viljemom IX. Akvitanskim, Hugom Vermandoisskim in Ido Avstrijsko. Njegov glavni uspeh je bil preprečiti spopad med križarji, ki so plenili bizantinsko ozemlje na poti v Konstantinopel, sam Welf pa je ušel fijasku, vendar je umrl na poti nazaj v Pafos na Cipru leta 1101 in je bil pokopan v opatiji Weingarten.

Bavarski<br/>–Super.<br/>Henrik IX., imenovan Črni, je bil od leta 1120 do 1126 vojvoda Bavarski. Henrik je bil sin vojvode Welfa I. iz njegovega zakona z Judith. Kot mladenič je upravljal posest družine Este južno od Alp, s poroko z Wulfhildo, hčerko vojvode Magnusa Saškega, okoli leta 1095, je pridobil del posesti Billung okoli Lüneburga. Želel je naslediti svojega tasta kot saški vojvoda, ko je Magnus umrl brez dedičev leta 1106. Vojvoda Henrik je kljub temu ohranil tesne odnose z vladajočo salijsko dinastijo, leta 1116 pa se je pridružil cesarju Henriku V. drugemu italijanskemu pohodu, da bi zasegel posestva pokojne markize Matilde Toskanske. Nasledil je svojega starejšega brata Welfa II. kot bavarski vojvoda, ko je slednji umrl brez otrok leta 1120, je Henrik prav tako prispeval k konkordatu v Wormsu leta 1122, s čimer je končal dolgotrajni investiturni spor med papežem in cesarjem. Poroka je bila sklenjena maja 1127, odtujitev med dinastijama Welf in Hohenstaufen je trajala do 13. stoletja, ko pa je Lothar zmagal na volitvah, je naložil cesarsko prepoved Frideriku II. Henrik je kmalu zatem umrl in bil pokopan v Weingartenu, njegova žena Wulfhilde pa ga je preživela le 16 dni.

Oba sta se poročila spomladi leta 1202, skupaj z zagotavljanjem pomembne dote, njun edini otrok pa je bil Otto, ki je podedoval očetovo lastnino in leta 1235 postal prvi vojvoda Brunswick-Lüneburg.

| Follow Us<br/><br/>ARE YOU AN<br/><br/>INSIDER<br/><br/>Craving Sugar? Here's What Your Body Is Trying to Tell You<br/><br/>by<br/>Byrdie<br/><br/>PHOTO:<br/><br/>Jacquemus<br/><br/>Weight gain from out-of-control cravings aside, it can be frustrating to have a constant hankering for something unhealthy and not know why. The good news is that there's usually a reason underlying that burning desire to house a bag of potato chips, or the feeling that you might actually die if you don't get a pickle rightthisinstant (even though you're not pregnant). If you're having visions of Milky Way bars, for example, it could mean that you're missing a very specific nutrient in your diet. (Yup—it's more complicated than said chocolate bar being so darn delicious.)<br/><br/>We talked to Los Angeles–based dietitian Shira Lenchewski, M.S., R.D., to get the skinny on some common food cravings, as well as what you can do to satiate the hunger without going overboard. Keep scrolling for some seriously good information!<br/><br/>If you're craving chocolate<br/><br/>It means: You could be lacking magnesium in your diet, says Lenchewski. "Magnesium is an essential mineral involved in energy production, glucose metabolism, and muscle function. This is especially true for those hitting the gym hard," she explains. Additionally, magnesium levels lower during the pre-menstrual weeks of your period, which explains why PMS so often comes with chocolate cravings.<br/><br/>Instead, reach for high-quality, low-sugar dark chocolate, which is naturally high in magnesium. "I recommend sticking to 75 per cent cocoa or higher, and pairing it with another magnesium-rich source like sunflower seeds," says Lenchewski. She suggests the chocolate brand Hu, a small-batch food company that focuses on high-quality ingredients produced locally. "It's a little pricey, but all the more reason to keep portions in check," she says. "It's my personal favourite." We're also big fans of superfood-packed Zenbunni.<br/><br/>If you're craving candy<br/><br/>It means: "Craving pure sugar is a good indication that you're running low on energy," says Lenchewski. "Think about it. What is the one thing you're itching for after a terrible night's sleep or at around 4 p.m. during a stressful workday? The answer is usually sugar because it's used as instant fuel for our body's cells."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for apples with nut butter. "If you're raiding your co-workers' candy stash, I recommend a more slow-burn carbohydrate with a source of fat or protein," says Lenchewski. "Unlike simple sugar, this will fuel your cells while avoiding the post-sugar crash. Two options that make for great pick-me-ups the next time you're craving candy: a sliced apple with your choice of nut butter, or berries with 2% unsweetened Greek yoghurt." We like quashing a sweet tooth with these addictive coconut chips, too—they're filling, free of any added sugar, and just so good.<br/><br/>If you're craving salt<br/><br/>It means: "If nothing but the saltiest pickle will do, you may not be drinking enough H2O," says Lenchewski. "Salt helps the body hold on to water, so we crave it when we're in need of fluids."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for water. "Stay hydrated, especially as we approach the summer months," she says. The next time a craving hits, try quenching it (literally) with a few refreshing glasses and you might find the urgency to sodium binge disappears. "If plain water bores you, try adding in mint, lemon, or frozen fruit to mix it up," says Lenchewski. And if that still doesn't do the trick, there's a healthier alternative to bagged chips or fries. "If you're really just craving salt after all, toasted seaweed is a great low-calorie option," she says.<br/><br/>If you're craving starchy carbs like pasta<br/><br/>It means: "Because high-carb foods boost the feel-good hormone serotonin, starch cravings can be a sign you're in need of a mood booster," says Lenchewski.<br/><br/>Instead, reach for a bath! "Bust out the Epsom salts, because it's time for some serious R+R," says Lenchewski. "Trust me. Indulging in a starch free-for-all feels really good in the moment, but it will likely bum you out more the next day." (As anyone who has ever over-indulged a pizza or pasta craving knows.) So the next time you want to dive head first into a bowl of carbs, draw a bath, light a candle, and treat yourself without any regret or dense calories.<br/><br/>If you're craving ice cream<br/><br/>5 / 6<br/><br/>It means: "Your body may be telling you it's in need of some healthy fat."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for coconut ice cream. "I'm a realist, so if you're craving ice cream, I'm not going to recommend a handful of walnuts, which are, of course, full of healthy fat," says Lenchewski. "For ice cream emergencies, I recommend lower-in-sugar coconut ice-creams like Coconut Bliss or Kippy's three-ingredient ice cream in Los Angeles." We can vouch for the fact that coconut ice cream tastes incredible and just like the real thing.<br/><br/>If you're craving a burger<br/><br/>It means: You need iron. "If you can't stop thinking about red meat, there's a chance your body is craving iron, b12 and folic acid," says Lenchewski. "This is especially true during or around that time of the month."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for a healthier burger. "I'm a proponent of grass fed, antibiotic and hormone-free red meat once a week," says Lenchewski. "Try experimenting with an open-faced bison burger—which, cut for cut, is leaner and has more iron than beef." Don't eat meat? Try to incorporate some kind of plant-based iron supplement into your routine, like spirulina. | Spremljajte nas<br/><br/>ALI STE TI<br/><br/>INSIDER<br/><br/>Hrepenenje po sladkorju? Tukaj je tisto, kar vam vaše telo poskuša povedati<br/><br/>Poročilo<br/>Byrdie<br/><br/>FOTOGRAFIJA:<br/><br/>Jacquemus<br/><br/>Povečanje telesne teže izven nadzora apetita stran, je lahko frustrirajoče, da imajo stalno hrepenenje po nekaj nezdravega in ne vem, zakaj. Dobra novica je, da ponavadi obstaja razlog za to gorečo željo po hiši vrečko krompirjevega čipsa ali občutek, da bi lahko dejansko umrli, če v tem trenutku ne dobite kumare (čeprav niste noseči). Če imate na primer vizije ploščic Mlečne ceste, bi to lahko pomenilo, da v vaši prehrani manjka zelo specifično hranilo. (Ja, bolj zapleteno je, kot je omenjeno, da je čokolada tako prekleto okusna.)<br/><br/>Pogovarjali smo se z dietetikom Shiro Lenchewski, M.S., R.D., ki temelji v Los Angelesu, da bi dobili suhe na nekaterih pogostih željah po hrani, pa tudi, kaj lahko storite, da bi potešili lakoto, ne da bi šli čez krov.<br/><br/>Če ste željni čokolade<br/><br/>To pomeni: Morda vam primanjkuje magnezija v vaši prehrani, pravi Lenchewski. "Magnezij je bistven mineral, ki sodeluje pri proizvodnji energije, presnovi glukoze in funkciji mišic. To še posebej velja za tiste, ki trdo udarjajo v telovadnici," pojasnjuje. Poleg tega so ravni magnezija nižje med predmenstrualnimi tedni menstruacije, kar pojasnjuje, zakaj PMS tako pogosto prihaja s čokoladnimi željami.<br/><br/>Namesto tega sezite po visokokakovostni temni čokoladi z nizko vsebnostjo sladkorja, ki je naravno bogata z magnezijem. »Priporočam, da se držite 75 odstotkov kakava ali več in ga združite z drugim virom, bogatim z magnezijem, kot so sončnična semena,« pravi Lenchewski. Predlaga blagovno znamko čokolade Hu, majhno serijsko živilsko podjetje, ki se osredotoča na visokokakovostne sestavine, proizvedene lokalno. "To je malo drago, vendar še bolj razlog, da obdržite dele pod nadzorom," pravi. "To je moj osebni najljubši." Smo tudi veliki ljubitelji superfood pakiranih Zenbunni.<br/><br/>Če hrepeniš po sladkarijah<br/><br/>Pomeni: "Želja po čistem sladkorju je dober pokazatelj, da vam primanjkuje energije," pravi Lenchewski. "Razmislite o tem. Kaj je edina stvar, za katero hrepenite po strašnem nočnem spanju ali okoli 4 ure med stresnim delovnim dnem? Odgovor je običajno sladkor, ker se uporablja kot instant gorivo za celice našega telesa.<br/><br/>Namesto tega segajo po jabolka z orehovo maslo. "Če ste napadli svoje sodelavce sladkarije zalogo, priporočam več počasi gorijo ogljikovih hidratov z virom maščob ali beljakovin," pravi Lenchewski. "Za razliko od preprostega sladkorja, bo to napajalo vaše celice, hkrati pa se izognilo trčenju po sladkorju. Dve možnosti, ki naredijo veliko pick-me-ups naslednjič, ko hrepenite po sladkarijah: narezano jabolko z vašo izbiro orehovega masla ali jagode z 2% nesladkanega grškega jogurta. Radi zmečkamo sladki zob s temi zasvojenimi kokosovimi čipi - polnijo se, brez dodanega sladkorja in tako dobro.<br/><br/>Če ste željni soli<br/><br/>Pomeni: "Če bo naredila samo najbolj slana kumara, morda ne boste pili dovolj H2O," pravi Lenchewski. "Sol pomaga telesu, da se drži vode, zato jo hrepenimo, ko potrebujemo tekočine."<br/><br/>Namesto tega posezite po vodi. "Ostanite hidrirani, še posebej, ko se bližamo poletnim mesecem," pravi. Naslednjič, ko hrepenenje zadene, ga poskusite ugasniti (dobesedno) z nekaj osvežilnimi kozarci in morda boste ugotovili, da je nujnost natrijevega bingeja izginila. "Če vas navadna voda dolgočasi, poskusite dodati meto, limono ali zamrznjeno sadje, da ga zmešate," pravi Lenchewski. In če to še vedno ne naredi trik, obstaja bolj zdrava alternativa vrečkam čips ali krompirček. "Če ste res samo hrepenenje po soli navsezadnje, opečene morske alge je odlična možnost z nizko vsebnostjo kalorij," pravi.<br/><br/>Če hrepenite po škrobnih ogljikovih hidratih, kot so testenine<br/><br/>To pomeni: "Ker živila z visoko vsebnostjo ogljikovih hidratov povečajo hormon serotonin, ki se počuti dobro, je lahko želja po škrobu znak, da potrebujete ojačevalec razpoloženja," pravi Lenchewski.<br/><br/>Namesto tega posezite po kopeli! »Izkopljite Epsomove soli, ker je čas za nekaj resnega R + R,« pravi Lenchewski. »Zaupajte mi. Prepuščanje škrobu brezplačno za vse se počuti res dobro v tem trenutku, toda naslednji dan vas bo verjetno še bolj razburilo.« (Kot ve vsakdo, ki se je kdaj preveč razvajal s pico ali testeninami.) Torej, naslednjič, ko se želite najprej potopiti v skledo ogljikovih hidratov, se kopajte, prižgite svečo in se zdravite brez obžalovanja ali gostih kalorij.<br/><br/>Če ste hrepenenje sladoled<br/><br/>5 / 6<br/><br/>Pomeni: "Vaše telo vam lahko pove, da potrebuje nekaj zdrave maščobe."<br/><br/>Namesto tega posezite po kokosovem sladoledu. »Sem realist, zato, če hrepenite po sladoledu, vam ne bom priporočil peščice orehov, ki so seveda polni zdrave maščobe,« pravi Lenchewski. "Za nujne primere sladoleda priporočam sladoled z nizko vsebnostjo sladkorja, kot je Coconut Bliss ali Kippyjev sladoled s tremi sestavinami v Los Angelesu." Lahko jamčimo za dejstvo, da ima kokosov sladoled neverjeten okus in prav tako kot prava stvar.<br/><br/>Če hočeš burger<br/><br/>To pomeni: Potrebujete železo. "Če ne morete prenehati razmišljati o rdečem mesu, obstaja možnost, da vaše telo hrepeni po železu, b12 in folni kislini," pravi Lenchewski. "To še posebej velja med ali okoli tega časa v mesecu."<br/><br/>Namesto tega posezite po bolj zdravem burgerju. »Sem zagovornik rdečega mesa, ki se hrani z travo, antibiotiki in brez hormonov enkrat na teden,« pravi Lenchewski. »Poskusite eksperimentirati z bizonskim burgerjem z odprtim obrazom, ki je, če ga razrežemo, vitkejši in ima več železa kot govedino.« Ne jejte mesa? Poskusite vključiti nekakšen dodatek železa na rastlinski osnovi v vašo rutino, kot je spirulina. |

| Web Services, Vendors And Cyber Laws!<br/><br/>Updated On:April 21, 2014Bilal Ahmad<br/><br/>Computerization of this world changed human performance scenario to a great extent and that too beyond measurement. For instance, Now you can send vital information all across the globe with a single mouse click, thanks to internet connectivity. Sadly, it is this wide connectivity and popularity among people, internet has also increased chances for computer crimes. Internet crimes or computer crimes are widely known as 'Cyber Crimes'.<br/><br/>'Cyber Laws' is something new in the judiciary system but has gained a lot of attention lately. The term cyber crime is something very synonymous with conventional crime, the only difference being medium of execution. There are majorly two types of cyber crimes, the first one is in which computers are the main targets and these include cases of data damage, malicious code and even criminal data access. The second one is in which computer is only a tool using which conventional crimes are committed for eg cyber terrorism, spamming, cyber stalking and many more.<br/><br/>This is where a website consultant or a vendor comes into scene. Although not aware of all the cyber laws present till date, a website vendor can advise you on some of the most vital cyber laws while creating your site.<br/><br/>This may include common knowledge of copy rights or even protecting the content of your own website. Explaining you all the rights you posses as a website owner is also one the tasks a website vendor may do while developing your website. A vendor can also assist you by offering you information on different cyber laws to protect data. Besides all of this, a vendor can also offer you information on any new cyber law that you may not be aware of till know. Cyber laws may vary from nation to nation, one recent example can be of the cookie law released in the United Kingdom, which prevents the website from saving any user browsing data. As per the Cookie Law, websites in the United Kingdom cannot save cookie files without informational consent from the surfer.<br/><br/>It is after the implementation of such law, websites now have a pop-up window, which seeks the consent of the visitor for saving cookies files. Such files are used by websites to analyze the browsing pattern of visitors based on which advertisements are then posted on a user window. With hacking not anymore a new thing for all of us, do you think such rules and regulations can prevent online forgery or cyber crime? Technology has developed at a rapid rate but still people do not prefer shopping online due to fear of personal or bank account details getting hacked. With the rise of cyber crime, need of stringent cyber laws have also increased to curb the same and to promote a risk free shopping experience.<br/><br/>Classes of Cyber Crimes<br/><br/>Over the years there have been three major classes of cyber crimes:<br/><br/>Unauthorized access of computer system cases, which involves hacking or stealing usernames and passwords to gain access over personal information of the respective user. These kind of backdoor access are organized with the help of Trojan Horse. Releasing malicious programs like Trojan House, worms or computer viruses etc. The last class includes cyber stalking a user or online harassment .<br/><br/>Direct implications of Cyber crimes<br/><br/>Decrease in sales<br/><br/>Decrease in staff output due to network delays<br/><br/>Loss of personalized information like research work<br/><br/>Disruption in communication process<br/><br/>Indirect implications of Cyber crimes<br/><br/>Credibility issue in our financial system<br/><br/>Brand image is tarnished in the market<br/><br/>Cyber crimes affect business to business relationship in the market<br/><br/>Sense of trust in state policies and government agencies is lost<br/><br/>Preventing Cyber Crime<br/><br/>As netizens there are certain precautions that we should consider for a safe and secure online experience. Here are some of them:<br/><br/>First thing to do will be to keep personal information to your self and avoid sharing the same online.<br/><br/>Avoid sharing any photographs with online chat friends or strangers.<br/><br/>Installing latest version of anti-virus on your system can offer you a good line of defense against internet threats like viruses and malware.<br/><br/>Keeping back up of your valuable data is a good option to avoid problems like virus contamination.<br/><br/>Avoid sending credit card information to sites that are unsecured and don't have any valid certificate.<br/><br/>Installing safety programme that offers you control over site cookies and saves you from being tracked by websites.<br/><br/>Putting host-based intrusions detection devices on servers will help you keep track of irregularities on your website traffic.<br/><br/>Use of firewall is advised.<br/><br/>Why Cyber attacks are so popular?<br/><br/>Cheaper than traditional cheating methods<br/><br/>Tracking cyber crimes are not easy<br/><br/>Exact locations cannot be tracked easily<br/><br/>Absence of physical barrier in the internet world<br/><br/>Cyber crimes affect large number of people<br/><br/>Conclusion<br/><br/>The fact that human mind has unfathomable power is undeniable, which is why internet crimes are increasing at a tremendous rate. Even history has witnessed some of the greatest internet security gone kaput by the hands of hackers, who have easily got away too. The only way to curb such crime is to remain aware of the cyber laws that we have today, that can either be through internet or through website/IT vendors. Information Technology Act has to be balanced in such a way that it proves too stringent for people who are involved in cyber crimes and at the same time it should never hamper the growth of Internet industry.<br/><br/>Author Bio:– Maneet Puri at present is heading a quality web design firm located at New Delhi, India. With unmatchable expertise in technical domain, he has been offering professional web consultation services to his clients located all round the globe. He is also an avid writer and some of his commended work have been published on renowned websites | Spletne storitve, prodajalci in kibernetski zakoni!<br/><br/>Posodobljeno:April 21, 2014Bilal Ahmad<br/><br/>Računalništvo tega sveta je v veliki meri spremenilo scenarij človeškega delovanja in da je preveč izmerjeno. Na primer, Zdaj lahko pošljete vitalne informacije po vsem svetu z enim klikom miške, zahvaljujoč internetni povezavi. Na žalost, to je ta široka povezljivost in priljubljenost med ljudmi, internet je tudi povečala možnosti za računalniške kaznivih dejanj. Internet kaznivih dejanj ali računalniških kaznivih dejanj so splošno znani kot "kibernetskih kaznivih dejanj".<br/><br/>"Kibernetski zakoni" so nekaj novega v pravosodnem sistemu, vendar so v zadnjem času pridobili veliko pozornosti. Izraz kibernetski kriminal je nekaj, kar je zelo sinonim za konvencionalni kriminal, edina razlika pa je medij usmrtitve. Obstajata predvsem dve vrsti kibernetskih kaznivih dejanj, prva je, pri kateri so računalniki glavne tarče in ti vključujejo primere škode na podatkih, zlonamerno kodo in celo dostop do kriminalnih podatkov. Drugi je, da je računalnik le orodje, s katerim se izvajajo običajna kazniva dejanja, npr. kibernetski terorizem, spam, kibernetsko zalezovanje in še veliko več.<br/><br/>To je, če spletna stran svetovalec ali prodajalec pride na prizorišče. Čeprav se ne zaveda vseh kibernetskih zakonov, ki so prisotni do danes, spletna stran prodajalec vam lahko svetuje o nekaterih najbolj pomembnih kibernetskih zakonov, medtem ko ustvarjate svojo spletno stran.<br/><br/>To lahko vključuje splošno znanje o pravicah kopiranja ali celo zaščito vsebine vaše lastne spletne strani. Pojasnitev vseh pravic, ki jih imate kot lastnik spletne strani, je tudi ena od nalog, ki jih lahko izvaja prodajalec spletne strani pri razvoju vaše spletne strani. Prodajalec vam lahko pomaga tudi tako, da vam ponuja informacije o različnih kibernetskih zakonov za zaščito podatkov. Poleg vsega tega, prodajalec vam lahko ponudi tudi informacije o vseh novih kibernetskih zakonov, ki jih morda ne vedo, dokler ne vedo. Kibernetski zakoni se lahko razlikujejo od države do države, eden od nedavnih primerov je zakon o piškotkih, ki je izdan v Združenem kraljestvu, ki preprečuje, da bi spletna stran shranila podatke o brskanju uporabnikov. V skladu z Zakonom o piškotkih spletne strani v Združenem kraljestvu ne morejo shranjevati piškotkov brez informativnega soglasja uporabnika.<br/><br/>Po uveljavitvi takšnega zakona imajo spletne strani zdaj pojavno okno, ki zahteva soglasje obiskovalca za shranjevanje piškotkov. Te datoteke uporabljajo spletne strani za analizo vzorca brskanja obiskovalcev na podlagi tega, kateri oglasi so nato objavljeni v uporabniškem oknu. Ker hekanje ni več nova stvar za vse nas, ali menite, da lahko takšna pravila in predpisi preprečijo spletno ponarejanje ali kibernetski kriminal? Tehnologija se je razvila s hitro hitrostjo, vendar ljudje še vedno ne raje nakupujejo na spletu zaradi strahu pred osebnimi ali bančnimi podatki, ki so bili vlomljeni. S porastom kibernetskega kriminala se je povečala tudi potreba po strogih kibernetskih zakonih, da bi to omejili in spodbudili nakupovanje brez tveganja.<br/><br/>Razredi kibernetskih kaznivih dejanj<br/><br/>V preteklih letih so se pojavili trije glavni razredi kibernetskih kaznivih dejanj:<br/><br/>Nepooblaščen dostop do primerov računalniškega sistema, ki vključuje vdor ali krajo uporabniških imen in gesel za dostop do osebnih podatkov zadevnega uporabnika. Ta vrsta dostopa zadaj so organizirani s pomočjo trojanskega konja. Sproščanje zlonamernih programov, kot so Trojan House, črvi ali računalniški virusi itd. Zadnji razred vključuje kibernetsko zalezovanje uporabnika ali spletno nadlegovanje.<br/><br/>Neposredne posledice kibernetskega kriminala<br/><br/>Zmanjšanje prodaje<br/><br/>Zmanjšanje števila zaposlenih zaradi zamud v omrežju<br/><br/>Izguba prilagojenih informacij, kot je raziskovalno delo<br/><br/>Motnje v komunikacijskem procesu<br/><br/>Posredne posledice kibernetskih kaznivih dejanj<br/><br/>Verodostojnost v našem finančnem sistemu<br/><br/>Ugled blagovne znamke je omadeževan na trgu<br/><br/>Kibernetski kriminal vpliva na poslovne odnose na trgu<br/><br/>Izgubljen občutek zaupanja v državne politike in vladne agencije<br/><br/>Preprečevanje kibernetskega kriminala<br/><br/>Kot netizens obstajajo nekatere previdnostne ukrepe, ki bi jih morali upoštevati za varno in varno spletno izkušnjo. Tukaj je nekaj od njih:<br/><br/>Prva stvar, ki jo morate storiti, je, da osebne podatke obdržite zase in se izognete delitvi istega na spletu.<br/><br/>Izogibajte se izmenjavi fotografij s prijatelji ali tujci v spletnem klepetu.<br/><br/>Namestitev najnovejše različice protivirusnega programa na vaš sistem vam lahko ponudi dobro obrambo pred internetnimi grožnjami, kot so virusi in zlonamerna programska oprema.<br/><br/>Ohranjanje varnostnih kopij vaših dragocenih podatkov je dobra možnost, da se izognete težavam, kot je kontaminacija z virusi.<br/><br/>Izogibajte se pošiljanju podatkov o kreditni kartici na spletna mesta, ki niso varna in nimajo veljavnega potrdila.<br/><br/>Namestitev varnostnega programa, ki vam ponuja nadzor nad piškotki spletnega mesta in vas varuje pred sledenjem spletnih mest.<br/><br/>Namestitev naprav za odkrivanje vdorov, ki temeljijo na gostitelju, na strežnike vam bo pomagala spremljati nepravilnosti v prometu spletnega mesta.<br/><br/>Uporaba požarnega zidu je priporočljiva.<br/><br/>Zakaj so kibernetski napadi tako priljubljeni?<br/><br/>Cenejši od tradicionalnih metod goljufanja<br/><br/>Sledenje kibernetskemu kriminalu ni lahko<br/><br/>Natančne lokacije ni mogoče zlahka slediti<br/><br/>Odsotnost fizične ovire v svetu interneta<br/><br/>Kibernetski kriminal prizadene veliko število ljudi<br/><br/>Zaključek<br/><br/>Dejstvo, da ima človeški um neizmerno moč, je nesporno, zato se internetni kriminal povečuje z ogromno hitrostjo. Celo zgodovina je bila priča nekaterim največjim internetnim varnostnikom, ki so jih uničili hekerji, ki so zlahka pobegnili. Edini način za zajezitev takega kaznivega dejanja je, da ostanejo seznanjeni s kibernetskimi zakoni, ki jih imamo danes, ki so lahko bodisi prek interneta ali prek spletnih strani / IT dobaviteljev. Zakon o informacijski tehnologiji je treba uravnotežiti tako, da se izkaže za preveč strogega za ljudi, ki so vpleteni v kibernetski kriminal, hkrati pa ne bi smel ovirati rasti internetne industrije.<br/><br/>Avtor Bio:– Maneet Puri trenutno vodi kakovostno podjetje za spletno oblikovanje, ki se nahaja v New Delhiju v Indiji.
