| Location<br/><br/>The ephemeral nature of New Zealand's screen production industry presents particular challenges for the introduction of environmentally responsible practices. One of these challenges is reducing the environmental impacts associated with working on location including special effects that may involve the use of fire, explosives, water and artificial snow. With no fixed office or studio base, it can be difficult for productions to develop and maintain environmental management systems. The suggestions below have been developed to assist screen production companies and professionals in managing their environmental impacts on location.<br/><br/>Protected environments<br/><br/>Follow the Department of Conservation guidelines and code of practice for Commercial Filming on Public Conservation Lands and ensure that any concessions required are in place.<br/>Educate cast, crew and extras about why the location is a protected environment.<br/>Minimise the number of vehicles and people at any one location and use transportation and technical equipment respectfully with regard to the landscape and animal habitats.<br/>Ensure all rubbish is well contained while on location, and remove and dispose of all rubbish responsibly.<br/>Cordon off areas that are particularly sensitive and mark the appropriate path for walkways and vehicles. Ensure these paths are also clearly marked on the daily call sheet.<br/>Ensure that the unit is carrying spill kits in the case of a fuel spill.<br/>Evaluate the location when filming is complete to identify any damage that may have occurred during filming. If damage has occurred, ensure it is rectified appropriately and in cooperation with the relevant authorities.<br/><br/>Natural, historical and cultural heritage is protected because it is special. For that very reason, these sites are highly desirable as film sets. Working sensitively and collaborating with the relevant authorities such as the New Zealand Department of Conservation (DOC) is essential for the success of the production. Failure to gain permission from the relevant authorities and follow requirements can lead to enforcement action, prosecution, adverse publicity, and spoil it for other producers wishing to use the location – a risk not worth taking. | Lokacija<br/><br/>Efemerna narava novozelandske industrije proizvodnje zaslonov predstavlja posebne izzive za uvedbo okoljsko odgovornih praks. Eden od teh izzivov je zmanjšanje vplivov na okolje, povezanih z delom na kraju samem, vključno s posebnimi učinki, ki lahko vključujejo uporabo ognja, eksplozivov, vode in umetnega snega. Brez stalne pisarne ali studijske baze lahko produkcije težko razvijejo in vzdržujejo sisteme okoljskega ravnanja. Spodnji predlogi so bili razviti za pomoč proizvajalcem zaslonov in strokovnjakom pri upravljanju njihovih vplivov na okolje na lokaciji.<br/><br/>Zaščiteno okolje<br/><br/>Sledite smernicam Oddelka za ohranjanje in kodeksu ravnanja za komercialno snemanje na javnih zemljiščih za ohranjanje in zagotovite, da so na voljo vse potrebne koncesije.<br/>Izobraževanje igralcev, ekipe in statistov o tem, zakaj je lokacija zaščiteno okolje.<br/>Zmanjšati število vozil in oseb na kateri koli lokaciji ter uporabljati prevoz in tehnično opremo v skladu s krajino in živalskimi habitati.<br/>Prepričajte se, da so vse smeti dobro zadržane, medtem ko ste na mestu, in odstranite in odstranite vse smeti odgovorno.<br/>Odstranite območja, ki so še posebej občutljiva, in označite ustrezno pot za pešpoti in vozila. Prepričajte se, da so te poti jasno označene tudi na dnevnem klicnem listu.<br/>Prepričajte se, da enota nosi komplete za razlitje v primeru razlitja goriva.<br/>Ocenite lokacijo, ko je snemanje končano, da ugotovite morebitno škodo, ki bi lahko nastala med snemanjem. Če je prišlo do škode, poskrbite, da jo ustrezno popravite in v sodelovanju z ustreznimi organi.<br/><br/>Naravna, zgodovinska in kulturna dediščina je zaščitena, ker je posebna. Prav zato so ta območja zelo zaželena kot filmski kompleti. Občutljivo delo in sodelovanje z ustreznimi organi, kot je Ministrstvo za ohranjanje Nove Zelandije (DOC), je bistvenega pomena za uspeh proizvodnje. Če pristojni organi ne pridobijo dovoljenja in ne upoštevajo zahtev, lahko pride do izvršilnih ukrepov, kazenskega pregona, škodljivega oglaševanja in pokvarijo to za druge proizvajalce, ki želijo uporabiti lokacijo – tveganje, ki ga ni vredno prevzeti. |

| Statistics 101: Fall 2011<br/>Data Analysis and Statistical Inference<br/><br/>Professor Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel<br/><br/>Course goals & objectives:<br/><br/>The overall goal of this class is to introduce you to the discipline of statistics as a science of understanding and analyzing data and not as a branch of mathematics. This class is designed to provide you with the tools you need for solving real world problems using statistics and a better understanding of the process of scientific research and statistical inference.<br/><br/>By the end of this class you should be able to interpret statistical results in context and critique news stories and journal articles that include statistical information. We expect you to be comfortable with concepts such as association and causation, random sampling and random assignment, statistical bias and statistical significance, and to understand and appreciate why real data beats anecdotes.<br/><br/>We plan to achieve these goals by introducing you to the relevant statistical knowledge, teaching you how to use an open source (i.e. free!) statistical software called RStudio to perform data analysis, and having you engage in problem solving, application, analysis, and synthesis of statistical information through homework, labs, quizzes and exams.<br/><br/>Please see the syllabus for detailed information on the course, policies, and grading. All course materials are posted on the schedule page (lecture notes, labs, assignments, etc.). | Statistika 101: Jesen 2011<br/>Analiza podatkov in statistično sklepanje<br/><br/>Profesor Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel<br/><br/>Cilji in cilji tečaja:<br/><br/>Splošni cilj tega razreda je, da vas seznanimo z disciplino statistike kot znanost razumevanja in analiziranja podatkov in ne kot veja matematike. Ta razred je zasnovan tako, da vam zagotovi orodja, ki jih potrebujete za reševanje problemov v resničnem svetu s pomočjo statistike in boljše razumevanje procesa znanstvenih raziskav in statističnega sklepanja.<br/><br/>Do konca tega razreda bi morali biti sposobni interpretirati statistične rezultate v kontekstu in kritizirati novice in članke v revijah, ki vsebujejo statistične informacije. Pričakujemo, da boste zadovoljni s koncepti, kot so povezava in vzročnost, naključno vzorčenje in naključna dodelitev, statistična pristranskost in statistična pomembnost, ter da boste razumeli in cenili, zakaj resnični podatki premagajo anekdote.<br/><br/>Te cilje načrtujemo doseči tako, da vas seznanimo z ustreznim statističnim znanjem, vas naučimo uporabljati odprtokodno (tj. brezplačno!) statistično programsko opremo, imenovano RStudio, za izvajanje analize podatkov in da se vključite v reševanje problemov, uporabo, analizo in sintezo statističnih informacij prek domačih nalog, laboratorijev, kvizov in izpitov.<br/><br/>Prosimo, glejte učni načrt za podrobne informacije o tečaju, politiki in ocenjevanju.

| .<br/><br/>.<br/><br/>Wednesday, April 6, 2011<br/><br/>They'd found her lying in the dirt, fifty feet off the road, cold and filthy, barely alive.<br/>Now Matthew knelt in the back of the ambulance and checked the oxygen mask strapped to the old woman's face, pressed his stethoscope to her nightgown and heard a dry rattling, more like the snap of shuffled cards than a steady whooshing.<br/>His surgical shears parted the rotten cloth of her right pajama leg. Her calf muscle was gone, torn away, ragged ends of veins and ligaments hanging from her thigh like wires from a half built electrical device.<br/>Speechless, he touched her tibia, wondering if arthritis could have gnarled the bone, or turned it brown and ridged, so much like a knotted walking stick. He exhaled through his nose and turned away. "Harry?" he said, unsure what words would come next.<br/>"I'm driving as fast as I can, ok? Any faster and the ambulance is going to turn over," Harry shouted over the diesel roar of the engine. "These windy back roads are a freaking nightmare. How's she doing?"<br/>"Not so good, Harry." he whispered. He'd cut away the cloth on her other leg and found it fuzzed and green. Beyond rational thought, his training guided his shears up through the damp wool of her nightgown, crotch to throat in one easy slice.<br/>Matthew dropped the shears and sat down hard on the corrugated steel floor. Her torso was fleshless, exposed. And infested. Something, some blind rodent squeezed through the flexing tunnel of her small intestine. Her lungs were twin blackbirds. One of them turned it's head and looked at him, with the bored, unimpressed manner of all birds, everywhere, peering through the wooden rails of her ribcage. He and his brother ruffled their wings, fluffing gently with each breath.<br/>The corner of her mouth twitched. Between the black feathers of her lungs, where her heart should be, something raw shifted and turned away from the light.<br/>Matthew leaned forward, peeled back one eyelid with his thumb, gripping a penlight in his fist like a stabbers knife, and shone the light into her eye. He'd expected a maggoty hole, or at best a milky cataract, but her pupils were clear, the sclera as clean and white as a healthy child's. The iris was rich amber, with emerald and sapphire chips. It glittered like some masterwork in a jewelers case.<br/>The pupil contracted at the light's rude penetration, and her jaw fell open, and she screamed, a deafening howl like a tornado tearing through a thousand dead trees. He fell hard as the ambulance jerked to the right, and in a sickening instant he felt Harry's shock at the sudden noise, his panicked overcorrection, the skipping tires on patchy asphalt, his own body weightless as the truck began to tip, balancing for an instant on two tires, off the road into a gulley before an oak tree punched through the grille and he was dashed against a wall and knocked senseless.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Chewing, he thought. Something eating something?<br/>What is. Where am?<br/>Matthew was awake but didn't know it yet. Sensation happened without forming a coherent whole. Pain in a hundred small places and one or two big ones, and he shifted to relieve an unbearable and growing ache in his knee, which brought mind and body slowly back together.<br/>He lay on the ceiling of the overturned ambulance. The white square wrappers of medical supplies drifted everywhere, rendering the boxy interior snowy and unreal. A heavy white suitcase lay atop his broken leg. He moaned in pain and confusion.<br/>The chewing stopped. He could hear something dripping. Then a long breath drawn by shuddering wings, and he remembered the woman on the stretcher, now crouched and feasting upon his partners half-hollowed torso. Two amber rings, flecked with blue and green, found him in the dark. Then it lunged.<br/>He kicked blindly and his toe caught the metal door that separated the cabin from the rear of the ambulance, snapping it shut just as the thing leapt. It impacted wetly against the reinforced steel, then found the window and wriggled through, fingernails like tiny shells slashing purple stripes into his legs. Matthew shrank away and saw that the creature was stuck, the edges of the window now wedged into the spaces between it's ribs.<br/>Blood pulsed out of his thighs in a hot and spreading pool. The thing strained forwards, it's ribs flexing and cracking, like it would have him even if it meant tearing itself in two. He wriggled to the back door found it sealed shut, the handle bashed and useless.<br/>White flashes started to interrupt the flow of his vision as he began to slip into shock. In staccato bursts, he saw the thing, now through to it's hips. The white suitcase. His ruined legs. The suitcase.<br/>The suitcase. Of course! The creature's hand seized his ankle, and he slapped it away, heaved the suitcase onto his chest and thumbed the latches open. The ON button depressed with a satisfying click. The thing was through the hole. The suitcase chirped, then chimed. She was upon him, clawing her way up his body. He snatched the paddles and pressed them against her chest. A single blackbird eye peered out at him.<br/>A blast of electricity shot through her corrupted body. Her chest was a flurry of panicked wings that burst into flames just after the third jolt, just before the defibrillator's battery died. She fell back, stinking smoke pouring from her mouth. Matthew smiled. As consciousness slipped away, he thought he could again hear chewing, though it was a smaller sound than before. Like a rat gnawing through a wall. Or out of it's cage.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>In the ashen dawn, some hours later, Matthew struggled through the shattered windshield and rose to his feet. He breathed in the cold morning air, black wings shuddering in his chest. Between them, in his core, something raw shifted and turned in it's new nest.<br/>He was hungry. He began to walk.<br/><br/>- - - Raised among the Hill Clans of Western Massachusetts, Mr. Hooke now lives and works in Philadelphia.

Njena teleča mišica je bila izginila, odtrgana, raztrgani konci žil in vezi, ki so viseli iz njenega stegna kot žice iz napol zgrajene električne naprave.<br/>Brez besed se je dotaknil njene golenice, spraševal se je, ali bi artritis lahko zagrabil kost, ali pa bi jo spremenil v rjavo in ukrivljeno, tako kot zapleteno palico. Izdihnil je skozi nos in se obrnil. »Harry?« je dejal, negotove, kakšne besede bodo sledile.<br/>"Vozim tako hitro, kot lahko, v redu? Če bo hitreje, se bo rešilec obrnil," je zakričal Harry nad dizelskim ropotom motorja. "Te vetrne ceste so prekleta nočna mora. Kako je z njo?"<br/>»Ne tako dobro, Harry,« je zašepetal. Odrezal ji je krpo na drugi nogi in ugotovil, da je puhasta in zelena. Njegova vadba je poleg racionalne misli vodila njegove škarje skozi vlažno volno njene spalne srajce, mednožje do grla v enem preprostem kosu.<br/>Matthew je spustil škarje in se trdno usedel na valovita jeklena tla. Njen trup je bil brez mesa, izpostavljen. In okužen. Nekaj, slepi glodavci so stisnili skozi upogibni tunel njenega tankega črevesa. Njena pljuča so bila dvojčka črnih ptic. Eden od njih je obrnil glavo in ga pogledal, z dolgočasnim, nenavdušenim obnašanjem vseh ptic, povsod, ki so buljili skozi lesene tirnice njene rebrne kletke. On in njegov brat sta ropotala krila, nežno puhala z vsakim dihom.<br/>Med črnim perjem njenih pljuč, kjer naj bi bilo njeno srce, se je nekaj surovega premaknilo in se obrnilo stran od svetlobe.<br/>Matthew se je nagnil naprej, s palcem olupil eno veko nazaj, v pesti zgrabil luč za pero, kot nož za zabadanje, in ji svetilko zasvetil v oko. Pričakoval je maggotno luknjo ali v najboljšem primeru mlečno katarakto, vendar so bili njeni učenci jasni, sklera čista in bela kot zdrav otrok. Iris je bila bogata z jantarom, s smaragdnimi in safirnimi čipi. Bleščala je kot nekakšna mojstrovina v primeru z nakitom.<br/>Učenka se je pri grobem vdoru svetlobe skrčila in njena čeljust se je odprla, ona pa je zakričala, oglušujoče zavijanje kot tornado, ki je raztrgal tisoč mrtvih dreves. Trdo je padel, ko je rešilec drkal na desno, in v bolnem trenutku je začutil Harryjev šok ob nenadnem hrupu, njegovem paničnem prekomernem popravku, preskočenih pnevmatikah na raztrganem asfaltu, lastnem telesu brez teže, ko se je tovornjak začel nagibati, za trenutek uravnotežil na dveh pnevmatikah, s ceste v jarek, preden je hrast udaril skozi mrež in je bil udarjen.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Žvečil, je pomislil.<br/>Kaj je, kje sem?<br/>Matthew je bil buden, vendar tega še ni vedel. Občutek se je zgodil, ne da bi oblikoval koherentno celoto. Bolečina v stotih majhnih krajih in enem ali dveh velikih, in se je premaknil, da bi olajšal neznosno in rastočo bolečino v kolenu, ki je počasi prinesla um in telo skupaj.<br/>Ležal je na stropu prevrnjenega rešilca. Povsod so drseli beli kvadratni ovoji medicinskih potrebščin, zaradi česar je škatlasta notranjost snežna in neresnična. Težki beli kovček je ležal na zlomljeni nogi. Stokal je v bolečini in zmedi.<br/>Žvečenje se je ustavilo. Slišal je nekaj kapljajočega. Potem je dolg dih pritegnil trepetajoča krila in se spomnil ženske na nosilih, ki je zdaj sklanjala in gostila na svojih partnerjih napol votli trup. Dva oranžna prstana, prekrita z modrim in zelenim, sta ga našla v temi.<br/>Slepo je brcnil in s prstom zadel kovinska vrata, ki so ločevala kabino od zadnjega dela rešilca, in jo zaprl, ko je stvar skočila. Mokro je udaril v ojačano jeklo, nato pa je našel okno in se prebil skozi, nohti kot majhne školjke, ki so mu rezali vijolične črte v noge. Matthew se je skrčil in videl, da je bitje obtičalo, robovi okna pa so se zdaj zaklenili v prostore med rebri.<br/>Kri mu je utripala iz stegen v vročem bazenu, ki se je napenjal naprej, rebra so se upogibala in razpokala, kot da bi se raztrgal na pol. Ko je prišel do zadnjih vrat, je našel zapečatena vrata zaprta, ročaj je bil pokvarjen in neuporaben.<br/>Beli utripi so začeli motiti pretok njegove vizije, ko je začel zdrsniti v šok. V staccato razpokah je videl stvar, zdaj do bokov. Beli kovček. Njegove uničene noge. Kovček.<br/>Kovček. Seveda! Stvorova roka je zgrabila njegov gleženj in ga je udaril, dvignil kovček na prsi in odprl ključavnice. Gumb ON se je z zadovoljujočim klikom pritisnil. Stvar je bila skozi luknjo. Kovček je zažvižgal, nato zazvonil. Bila je na njem, ki se je držala navzgor po telesu. Zgrabil je vesla in jih pritisnil na prsi. Eno oko črne ptice je strmelo vanj.<br/>Skozi njeno pokvarjeno telo je izbruhnila elektrika. Njeni prsi so bili valovi paničnih kril, ki so se zažgali tik po tretjem udarcu, tik preden je baterija defibrilatorja umrla. Padla je nazaj, smrdljiv dim, ki se ji je izlil iz ust. Matthew se je nasmehnil. Ko je zavest zdrsnila, je mislil, da lahko spet sliši žvečenje, čeprav je bil to manjši zvok kot prej. Kot podgana, ki grize skozi steno. Ali iz kletke.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Ob pepelni zori, nekaj ur kasneje, se je Matthew boril skozi razbito vetrobransko steklo in vstal na noge. Vdihnil je hladen jutranji zrak, črna krila so mu drhtela v prsih.

| The play "Equus" by Peter Schaffer investigates ideas of faith, passion, violence, and adolescent sexuality. Schaffer was inspired to write the play after hearing a true story; a crime involving a teenage boy's seemingly motiveless violence and injury to horses. Equus is a fictional account of what Schaffer believes could have happened before the incident, helping to explain the psychology and reasoning behind the boy's mysterious and disturbing crime. Equus follows closely the character of 17 - year-old boy Alan Strang, but also his psychiatrist, Martin Dysart. In this piece of writing, I plan to explain how we explored the play of Equus in a variety of different activities within our drama class.<br/><br/>Response<br/><br/>The play opens with Martin Dysart, the psychiatrist, performing a soliloquy that introduces the main themes of the play. Scene one is devoted entirely to this speech, which shows its importance and vitality. We learn much about Dysart from this speech. For example, the line "All reined up in old/language and old assumptions" illustrates how he feels trapped and frustrated in his life. In addition, he says, "I'm desperate" which shows his exhaustion and frustration. | Igra "Equus" Peter Schaffer raziskuje ideje vere, strasti, nasilja in mladostniške spolnosti. Schaffer je bil navdihnjen, da napiše igro, potem ko je slišal resnično zgodbo; zločin, ki vključuje navidezno nemotivirano nasilje in poškodbe konj najstnika. Equus je izmišljena zgodba o tem, kaj se je po Schafferjevem prepričanju lahko zgodilo pred incidentom, ki pomaga razložiti psihologijo in utemeljitev fantovega skrivnostnega in vznemirljivega zločina. Equus natančno spremlja značaj 17-letnega fanta Alana Stranga, pa tudi njegovega psihiatra, Martina Dysarta. V tem delu nameravam pojasniti, kako smo raziskali igro Equus v različnih dejavnostih v našem dramskem razredu.<br/><br/>Odziv<br/><br/>Predstava se začne s psihiatrom Martinom Dysartom, ki izvaja solilokvijo, ki uvaja glavne teme igre. Scena je v celoti posvečena temu govoru, ki kaže na njegov pomen in vitalnost. O Dysartu se veliko naučimo iz tega govora. Na primer, vrstica "Vse obvlada v starem/jeziku in starih predpostavkah" ponazarja, kako se počuti ujet in frustriran v svojem življenju. Poleg tega pravi: "Jaz sem obupan", kar kaže na njegovo izčrpanost in frustracijo. |
