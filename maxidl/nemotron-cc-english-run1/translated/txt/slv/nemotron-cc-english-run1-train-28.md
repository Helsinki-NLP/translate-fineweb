| There is a well known quote by Plato who once said: "I would teach children music, physics and philosophy, but most importantly music for the patterns in music and all the arts are the keys to learning.<br/><br/>Whatever your religion or culture music will always play and important part. It often defines what is essentially unique about a particular group of people and helps to create a sense of community. Dr Shinichi Suzuki describes his teaching this way: 'Teaching music is not my main purpose. I want to make good citizens. If a child hears fine music from the day of his birth and learns to play it himself, he develops sensitivity, discipline and endurance. He gets a beautiful heart. Along with improving self-esteem and self-expression their are also benefits that include increasing memory and is believed that learning music can boost academic achievement. Although the exact mechanics of this is often not understood, the belief is that learning music stimulates parts of the brain that then have a carry-over impact on all academic areas.<br/><br/>Research indicates that the brain of a musician, even a young one works differently than that of a non-musician. In the field of Neuroscience research has shown that a larger proportion of neural pathways are used in learning music as the brain has to work harder.<br/><br/>There is a link between this and improved spacial-temporal skills that help in solving multistep problems such as in the fields of maths, engineering and the arts.<br/><br/>It also provides structure and focus which may benefit other areas of learning. As well as bringing, structure, organisation and discipline which carries over into other areas of your childs life we must not forget the most important fact about learning music. It brings enjoyment and a sense of fun. | Platon je nekoč dejal: »Učil bi otroke glasbe, fizike in filozofije, toda najpomembneje je, da je glasba za vzorce v glasbi in vse umetnosti ključ do učenja.<br/><br/>Ne glede na vašo vero ali kulturo bo glasba vedno igrala pomembno vlogo. Pogosto opredeljuje, kaj je v bistvu edinstveno za določeno skupino ljudi in pomaga ustvariti občutek skupnosti. Dr. Shinichi Suzuki opisuje svoje poučevanje takole: "Poučevanje glasbe ni moj glavni namen. Želim narediti dobre državljane. Če otrok sliši lepo glasbo od dneva svojega rojstva in se jo nauči igrati, razvije občutljivost, disciplino in vzdržljivost. Dobi lepo srce. Skupaj z izboljšanjem samospoštovanja in samoizražanja so tudi koristi, ki vključujejo povečanje spomina in je verjel, da učenje glasbe lahko poveča akademske dosežke. Čeprav natančna mehanika tega pogosto ni razumljena, je prepričanje, da učenje glasbe stimulira dele možganov, ki nato vplivajo na vsa akademska področja.<br/><br/>Raziskave kažejo, da možgani glasbenika, celo mladega, delujejo drugače kot možgani neglasbenika. Raziskave na področju nevroznanosti so pokazale, da se večji delež nevronskih poti uporablja pri učenju glasbe, saj morajo možgani delati težje.<br/><br/>Obstaja povezava med tem in izboljšanimi prostorsko-časovnimi spretnostmi, ki pomagajo pri reševanju večstopenjskih problemov, kot so na področju matematike, inženirstva in umetnosti.<br/><br/>Zagotavlja tudi strukturo in osredotočenost, ki lahko koristi drugim področjem učenja. Poleg prinašanja strukture, organizacije in discipline, ki se prenašajo na druga področja otrokovega življenja, ne smemo pozabiti na najpomembnejše dejstvo o učenju glasbe. Prinaša užitek in občutek zabave. |

| Breaking out of the Box Fay Tsitou investigates moving objects in British museums<br/><br/>Objects are the main 'protagonists' in two different fields: museums and puppetry. In both cases, the objects enable us to interact with our surroundings, our past, and our inner self.<br/><br/>Museum visitors perceive a vast majority of the museum objects from a distance, while these remain mainly static and mute in or outside the galleries' showcases. On the other hand, puppet theatre audiences join the world of moving objects/puppets that are often literally given a voice (sound or speech). Nevertheless, is there a common ground of static and moving objects worth exploring in these contexts?<br/><br/>Museum Puppetry Research<br/><br/>Museum puppetry adopts the language of puppetry within museum exhibitions. It aims at investigating the interaction among museum visitors, objects' stories, exhibits' histories and exhibitions' narratives. It examines how object-centred activities discretely disguise their visitor-centred identity while they enable visitors to free their mind and heart from possible inhibitions or preconceptions. Museum puppetry is a type of museum learning activity, similar to and often combined with museum theatre. However, as G.B. Shaw might say, 'the actor in his primitive form' (i.e. the puppet) unblocks the audiences' imagination which '…plays a far greater part than the exertions of the actors'.<br/><br/>Museum puppetry examples in UK<br/><br/>There are a number of variables that characterise a museum puppetry activity, such as the type of museum, the type of puppetry, the target group, the activity area in the museum, the degree of interaction among the four units (participants, exhibits/collections, puppets, practitioners), the use of verbal and/or object language. For instance, one type of activity could be a complete show around a museum's performing object, as for example in the Keswick museum in Cumbria where Ali Mc Caw presented a wayang kulit style performance, The Musical Stonemason. The show combined shadow and table-top puppetry with a gamelan orchestra which incorporated a museum object, the musical stone of Skiddaw. Moreover, shows can be related to an exhibit's narrative. For example Professor Geoff Felix's popular Punch and Judy street puppet theatre show was presented in the garden of the Geoffrey Museum and at the Museum of London as part of the Victoria Street exhibit (It is no surprise to learn that Felix's beautifully crafted booth was once mistaken for an exhibit as it was standing in an open area at the same museum!)<br/><br/>Other examples include:<br/><br/>A workshop on puppet construction and manipulation - like the skilfully structured workshop that follows Anna Ingleby's shadow puppetry shows<br/><br/>A puppet workshop based on the museum's handling collection - as this happens at the Horniman Museum (London) to acquaint primary school students with the various types of puppets<br/><br/>A puppet exhibit - like the automata or the dinosaur animatronics in the Natural History Museum in London<br/><br/>Creative learning processes with the use of everyday objects - as these are facilitated by Hedsor Creative Learning, to enhance museum interpretation in places such as Sheffield Museums and Galleries Trust and Manchester City Art Gallery<br/><br/>A museum tour with the puppet as a storyteller/facilitator - like Vivien Mousdell's palaeontologist Dr. Ambrose in her puppet show Fossils Alive<br/><br/>An outreach programme - like Jill Webster's interactive puppet show Pirates! All Hands on Deck!, commissioned by Glasgow Science Centre<br/><br/>Manipulation of puppets that belong to original collections is considered par excellence a museum puppetry case - as John Mc Cormick performed with the Victorian Marionettes at the Museum Theatre in London.<br/><br/>The following cases further illuminate the multifaceted potential of performing objects in museums.<br/><br/>'Authentic' metaphors<br/><br/>For twenty-five years adult museum visitors have been enjoying Robert Poulter's New Model Theatre shows in conjunction with special exhibitions and collections, in numerous European and US museums. During Poulter's sophisticated toy theatre shows, paper figures travel smoothly in time and space while interacting with each other and their stage environment. Backdrops are changing continuously. The audience perceives the world represented on stage neither as something static, nor fragmented, but fluidly constructed moment by moment. Although puppetry favours mythological and fictional stories, Poulter makes use of his talent in painting and research skills to interpret selectively historical evidence via flat figures and settings that move vertically and horizontally. The elaborate, live montage evolves as fast and as easy, as the turning of a page. For example, during the art history show Mr Turner Gets Steamed Up, action moves instantly from Margate to London, or from the view out of Turner's window onto the canvas of his famous paintings. The liberties taken with the spoken and visual narrative are noted in detail on the program of the show, allowing Poulter's beautifully crafted paper figures to stand bravely as ultimate 'authentic' metaphors on a miniature stage of History.<br/><br/>Multi-sensory experience<br/><br/>Real coffee beans, shells and cloves cover small wooden boats which sail in a Museum of Docklands' performance originally devised for visitors with the most complex educational needs. The boats' cargo can be smelled and felt as they (metaphorically) travel over the sea to London's Victorian docks in a storytelling piece entitled Over the Sea to London, devised by Emily Capstick and Alison Hale (Peoplescape Theatre). Peoplescape have been creating participatory performances in community, education and museum settings for twelve years. Taking advantage of applied theatre techniques, live music and puppetry's rich potential and flexibility, Capstick and Hale replace verbal description of the past with live action in the present. They create a multi-sensory engaging experience for an audience in-role role with the use of puppets and manipulated objects, without relying on verbal communication.<br/><br/>Popular art<br/><br/>Last year, Dr Matthew Isaac Cohen, as a dhalang shadow puppeteer performed his Ramayana in four parts with the Southbank Gamelan Players at the British Library, where an exhibition under the same title explored how the Indian epic story is retold over the centuries. Similarly to a presentation to an Indonesian audience (who enjoy a great deal of freedom in watching the popular story – spectators can move around, take a nap, leave the show and return!), the Library's audience could watch the nearly three-hour performance seated on pillows or circulating around it. During the show, the spectators could also either move towards the exhibition area to enjoy a museum experience while still hearing the superb chanting and music, or they could go behind the screen and the performers to have a drink while still enjoying the delightful puppet show from the back, viewed through a door opening. While standing in the middle, the wayang kulit Indonesian type of shadow puppetry created an intimate in-between space bridging two worlds: art and life.<br/><br/>Two remarkable cases outside UK<br/><br/>In 2002, a Brooklyn-based constructor/puppeteer, Chris Green, was commissioned to create a part of Noah's Ark exhibit in the Skirball Cultural Center in LA. His sophisticated kinetic or fully manipulated installations – interactive exhibits and puppets manipulated by the museum staff – were made of recycled materials and today attract people of all ages and backgrounds. The Noah's Ark exhibit received awards of excellence from the American Association of Museums and Themed Entertainment Association.<br/><br/>In 2001, the renowned French director Philippe Philippe Genty presented Le Concert Incroyable in the Grande Salle de l' Evolution in the Natural History Museum of Paris. High technology projections of inventive graphic designs were used and interacted with the central exhibit of the gallery: a march that consisted of large mummified animals. This puppet and physical theatre show was a composition of mesmerising images, dramatic action and chorus singing; a unique experience for an adult audience.<br/><br/>So, as we can see museum puppetry embraces a far broader spectrum of practice than might at first be thought! To perceive museums as just another sort of venue, and museum puppetry as a merely a medium suitable to attract preschoolers with their families during Christmas period, is limiting. Recognising the performing objects' potential and communicative power, some museums support their use for their activities and learning programmes year-round.<br/><br/>In fact, these are the museums that foster a close relation between the two inanimate 'soul brothers': museum exhibits and performing objects. In the hands of the experts, such interactions give an extra meaning to an old mystery: '…Inanimate objects / have you then a soul / That clings to our soul / and forces it to love?...' (Alphonse Lamartine, Milly ou la terre natale, 1822)<br/><br/>George Bernard Shaw quotation is taken from his introduction to Max Von Boehn's Puppets and Automata (Dover Publications. New York, 1972, trans. Josephine Nicoll) | Fay Tsitou raziskuje premikajoče se predmete v britanskih muzejih<br/><br/>Predmeti so glavni "protagonisti" na dveh različnih področjih: muzeji in lutkarstvo. V obeh primerih nam objekti omogočajo interakcijo z našo okolico, našo preteklostjo in našim notranjim jazom.<br/><br/>Obiskovalci muzeja zaznavajo veliko večino muzejskih predmetov na daljavo, medtem ko ti ostajajo večinoma statični in nemi v vitrinah galerij ali zunaj njih. Po drugi strani pa se lutkovno gledališče pridruži svetu gibljivih predmetov/lutk, ki jim pogosto dobesedno damo glas (zvok ali govor). Kljub temu, ali je v teh kontekstih vredno raziskati skupno podlago statičnih in gibljivih predmetov?<br/><br/>Muzej lutkovnega raziskovanja<br/><br/>Muzejsko lutkarstvo v okviru muzejskih razstav prevzame jezik lutkarstva. Njegov cilj je raziskati interakcijo med obiskovalci muzeja, zgodbe predmetov, zgodovine razstav in pripovedi razstav. Preučuje, kako objektno usmerjene dejavnosti diskretno prikrivajo svojo identiteto, medtem ko obiskovalcem omogočajo, da osvobodijo svoj um in srce morebitnih zaviranja ali predsodkov. Muzejsko lutkarstvo je vrsta muzejske učne dejavnosti, ki je podobna in pogosto kombinirana z muzejskim gledališčem. Vendar pa, kot bi lahko rekel G.B. Shaw, »igralec v svoji primitivni obliki« (tj. lutka) odpira domišljijo občinstva, ki »igra veliko večjo vlogo kot napori igralcev«.<br/><br/>Primeri muzejskega lutkarstva v Združenem kraljestvu<br/><br/>Obstaja več spremenljivk, ki označujejo muzejsko lutkovno dejavnost, kot so vrsta muzeja, vrsta lutkovne dejavnosti, ciljna skupina, področje dejavnosti v muzeju, stopnja interakcije med štirimi enotami (udeleženci, razstave / zbirke, lutke, praktiki), uporaba verbalnega in / ali objektnega jezika. Na primer, ena vrsta dejavnosti bi lahko bila popolna razstava okoli muzejskega predmeta, na primer v muzeju Keswick v Cumbriji, kjer je Ali Mc Caw predstavil predstavo v stilu Wayang Kulit, The Musical Stonemason. Razstava je združevala lutkovno senco in namizno lutko z orkestrom gamelan, ki je vključeval muzejski predmet, glasbeni kamen Skiddaw. Poleg tega so lahko razstave povezane z narativom razstave. Na primer, priljubljena lutkovna gledališka predstava profesorja Geoffa Felixa in Judy je bila predstavljena na vrtu Geoffreyjevega muzeja in v muzeju v Londonu kot del razstave Victoria Street (Ni presenetljivo, da je bila Felixova lepo izdelana stojnica nekoč zamenjana za razstavo, saj je stala na odprtem prostoru v istem muzeju!)<br/><br/>Drugi primeri vključujejo:<br/><br/>Delavnica o lutkovni gradnji in manipulaciji - kot spretno strukturirana delavnica, ki sledi lutkarskim predstavam sence Anne Ingleby<br/><br/>Lutkovna delavnica, ki temelji na muzejski zbirki - kot se to zgodi v muzeju Horniman (London), da bi osnovnošolce seznanili z različnimi vrstami lutk<br/><br/>Lutkovna razstava - kot avtomata ali animatronika dinozavrov v Naravoslovnem muzeju v Londonu<br/><br/>Ustvarjalni učni procesi z uporabo vsakdanjih predmetov - kot jih omogoča Hedsor Creative Learning, za izboljšanje muzejske interpretacije na mestih, kot so Sheffield muzeji in galerije Trust in Manchester City Art Gallery<br/><br/>Muzejska turneja z lutko kot pripovedovalko / facilitatorjem - kot paleontolog Vivien Mousdell Dr. Ambrose v njeni lutkovni predstavi Fosili Živi<br/><br/>Program ozaveščanja - kot interaktivna lutkovna predstava Jill Webster Pirati! Vse roke na palubi!, ki jo je naročil Znanstveni center Glasgow<br/><br/>Manipulacija z lutkami, ki pripadajo izvirnim zbirkam, se šteje za muzejski lutkovni primer - kot je John Mc Cormick nastopal z viktorijanskimi lutkami v muzejskem gledališču v Londonu.<br/><br/>Naslednji primeri dodatno osvetljujejo večplasten potencial izvedbenih predmetov v muzejih.<br/><br/>"Verodostojne" metafore<br/><br/>Odrasli muzejski obiskovalci že petindvajset let uživajo v gledaliških predstavah novega modela Roberta Poulterja v povezavi s posebnimi razstavami in zbirkami v številnih evropskih in ameriških muzejih. Med Poulterjevimi sofisticiranimi predstavami gledališča igrač se papirnate figure nemoteno premikajo skozi čas in prostor, hkrati pa komunicirajo med seboj in s svojim odrskim okoljem. Občinstvo dojema svet, ki je predstavljen na odru, ne kot nekaj statičnega, ne kot razdrobljenega, ampak kot fluidno konstruiran trenutek za trenutkom. Čeprav lutkarstvo favorizira mitološke in fiktivne zgodbe, Poulter uporablja svoj talent v slikarstvu in raziskovalnih veščinah za selektivno interpretacijo zgodovinskih dokazov prek ravnih figur in nastavitev, ki se gibljejo navpično in vodoravno. Prefinjena, živa montaža se razvija tako hitro in enostavno, kot obračanje strani. Na primer, med umetniško zgodovino razstave Mr Turner Gets Steamed Up se akcija takoj premakne iz Margate v London ali iz pogleda iz Turnerjevega okna na platno njegovih znanih slik. Svobode, vzete z govorno in vizualno pripovedjo, so podrobno opisane v programu predstave, kar omogoča, da Poulterjeve lepo izdelane papirnate figure pogumno stojijo kot končne "verodostojne" metafore na miniaturnem odru zgodovine.<br/><br/>Multisenzorična izkušnja<br/><br/>Prava kavna zrna, školjke in nageljni pokrivajo majhne lesene čolne, ki plujejo v predstavi muzeja Docklands, ki je bil prvotno zasnovan za obiskovalce z najbolj zapletenimi izobraževalnimi potrebami. Tovor ladij je mogoče zavohati in začutiti, ko (metaforično) potujejo po morju do londonskih viktorijanskih dokov v pripovednem delu z naslovom Over the Sea to London, ki sta ga zasnovala Emily Capstick in Alison Hale (Peoplescape Theatre). Peoplescape že dvanajst let ustvarja participativne predstave v skupnosti, izobraževanju in muzejskem okolju. Z uporabo uporabnih gledaliških tehnik, bogatega potenciala in prilagodljivosti žive glasbe in lutk, Capstick in Hale nadomeščata verbalni opis preteklosti z živim delovanjem v sedanjosti. Ustvarjajo multisenzorično privlačno izkušnjo za občinstvo v vlogi z uporabo lutk in manipuliranih predmetov, ne da bi se zanašali na verbalno komunikacijo.<br/><br/>Priljubljena umetnost<br/><br/>Lani je dr. Matthew Isaac Cohen kot lutkar v senci Dhalang v štirih delih izvedel svojo Ramayano z igralci Southbank Gamelan v Britanski knjižnici, kjer je razstava pod istim naslovom raziskala, kako se indijska epska zgodba pripoveduje skozi stoletja. Podobno kot predstavitev indonezijskemu občinstvu (ki uživa veliko svobode pri gledanju priljubljene zgodbe - gledalci se lahko premikajo, zadremajo, zapustijo predstavo in se vrnejo!), je občinstvo knjižnice lahko gledalo skoraj triurni nastop, ki je sedel na blazinah ali krožil okoli njega. Med predstavo se lahko gledalci premaknejo tudi proti razstavnemu prostoru, da bi uživali v muzejski izkušnji, medtem ko še vedno slišijo vrhunsko petje in glasbo, ali pa bi lahko šli za zaslon in izvajalce, da bi imeli pijačo, medtem ko še vedno uživajo v čudoviti lutkovni predstavi od zadaj, ki jo gledajo skozi odprtino vrat. Medtem ko stoji v sredini, je wayang kulit indonezijska vrsta lutk v senci ustvarila intimni prostor med dvema svetovoma: umetnostjo in življenjem.<br/><br/>Dva izjemna primera izven Velike Britanije<br/><br/>Leta 2002 je bil brooklynski konstruktor / lutkar Chris Green naročen, da ustvari del razstave Noetove barke v kulturnem centru Skirball v LA. Njegove prefinjene kinetične ali popolnoma manipulirane instalacije – interaktivni eksponati in lutke, ki jih manipulira muzejsko osebje – so bile narejene iz recikliranih materialov in danes privabljajo ljudi vseh starosti in ozadij. Razstava Noetove barke je prejela nagrade za odličnost Ameriškega združenja muzejev in Združenja za tematsko zabavo.<br/><br/>Leta 2001 je znani francoski režiser Philippe Philippe Genty predstavil koncert Neverjetno v Veliki dvorani evolucije v Naravoslovnem muzeju v Parizu. Uporabljene so bile visokotehnološke projekcije iznajdljivih grafičnih modelov, ki so bili v interakciji z osrednjo razstavo galerije: pohodom, ki je bil sestavljen iz velikih mumificiranih živali. Lutkovna in fizikalna gledališka predstava je bila kompozicija očarljivih podob, dramatične akcije in zborovskega petja; edinstvena izkušnja za odrasle občinstvo.<br/><br/>Torej, kot lahko vidimo, muzejsko lutkarstvo zajema veliko širši spekter prakse, kot bi lahko sprva mislili! Omejevanje dojemanja muzejev kot druge vrste prizorišča in muzejske lutke kot le medij, ki je primeren za privabljanje predšolskih otrok s svojimi družinami v božičnem obdobju. Nekateri muzeji priznavajo potencial in komunikacijsko moč izvajalskih objektov, zato podpirajo njihovo uporabo za svoje dejavnosti in učne programe skozi vse leto.<br/><br/>Pravzaprav so to muzeji, ki spodbujajo tesno povezavo med dvema neživima "bratoma duše": muzejskimi eksponati in izvedbenimi predmeti. V rokah strokovnjakov take interakcije dajejo dodaten pomen stari skrivnosti: "... Neživi predmeti/imaš potem dušo/ki se drži naše duše/in jo sili, da ljubi?« (Alphonse Lamartine, Milly ou la terre natale, 1822)<br/><br/>George Bernard Shaw je citat iz njegovega uvoda v Max von Boehn je lutke in avtomate (Dover Publications. New York, 1972, trans. Josephine Nicoll) |

We must maintain the momentum gained on these issues in the high-level panel through to the final deliberations at the UN General Assembly in 2014 on global goals for poverty eradication and sustainable development. Now more than ever, we need to recognise the centrality of gender equality. Now more than ever, we must end gender inequality as the grand objective of the 21st century.<br/><br/>Promoting gender equality in the post-2015 agenda includes finishing the work that the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) started. Unfortunately, the MDGs that are most off-track are those directly linked to achieving gender equality, such as reducing maternal mortality and ensuring universal reproductive health and rights. There is by now overwhelming evidence that gender inequality severely constrains women's independence and freedom, control over their own bodies, sexuality and childbearing, and restricts their life choices and opportunities in terms of education and work. There is also abundant evidence that it significantly slows economic growth in both rich and poor countries.<br/><br/>Across the world, in all societies, women and girls consistently face a range of barriers to equality - such as wage gaps, gender-based violence, child marriage and female genital mutilation. The poor and otherwise socially disadvantaged are further marginalised through crippling combinations of gender discrimination and poverty discrimination. Therefore, tackling the gender inequalities and critical barriers that prevent women and girls from exercising their rights and empowering themselves must be at the heart of our efforts to create sustainable, prosperous and resilient societies.<br/><br/>Achieving gender equality - including women's rights, women's health and women's empowerment - is not only a means to eradicating poverty and achieving sustainable development, it is an important end in itself.<br/><br/>Landmark documents such as the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development, and the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action have long established that women's rights are human rights. CEDAW, established in 1979 and ratified by almost every country in the world, places responsibility for ensuring equal rights for men and women with the state. Women must be offered the same access to all aspects of life as men in order to reach equal status.<br/><br/>We have not achieved this yet. Therefore, we are recommending that the UN General Assembly consider effectively tackling this challenge, and the unfinished business of the MDGs, by ensuring that gender equality and sexual and reproductive health are at the centre of the post-2015 development agenda, with relevant goals, targets and indicators approved.<br/><br/>This proposal has strong support among a wide range of stakeholders and development actors, including many governments, multilateral agencies and civil society organisations. The respective national, regional and global thematic consultations on health, inequalities and education in the post-2015 agenda, as well as the Rio+20 outcome document's framework for action and follow-up, have all stressed the centrality of gender equality and women's empowerment.<br/><br/>The MDGs created an unprecedented mobilisation of political will and resources in recent years, not least around MDGs 4 and 5 related to reducing maternal and infant death. Both of these goals are inextricably linked to gender equality and the rights, health and empowerment of women and girls. It is essential for our common efforts regarding these to be carried over and further strengthened in the post-2015 agenda. Including goals on gender equality and sexual and reproductive health and rights in the post-2015 agenda will highlight, once again, the central role of women's rights as human rights. The panel report has given a strong momentum for these issues - now it is up to all of us global actors to maintain it, and make sure that it survives all the way to 2015.<br/><br/>We are at a decisive point in our common history when our policy intentions and actions will shape the future of human development and our planet in the face of both unprecedented achievements and persistent challenges. Let us ensure that the post-2015 agenda is truly universal and inclusive, and that the ultimate goal is a world where all - men, women, young people and children - are treated as equally worthy lens is suitable for general macro work but if you want greater subject-to-lens distance a 100mm lens will give you this at a price.

Skoraj 20 let kasneje ostaja izziv zagotavljanja pravic žensk.<br/><br/>Skupina na visoki ravni generalnega sekretarja ZN za razvojno agendo za obdobje po letu 2015 je 30. maja objavila poročilo, ki vsebuje samostojni cilj o enakosti spolov in krepitvi vloge žensk in deklet. Poleg tega ponazoritveni zdravstveni cilj vsebuje cilj zagotavljanja univerzalnega spolnega in reproduktivnega zdravja in pravic.<br/><br/>Enakost spolov ter zagotavljanje splošnega spolnega in reproduktivnega zdravja in pravic sta bistveni sestavini trajnostnega razvoja. Ohraniti moramo zagon, ki smo ga pridobili pri teh vprašanjih na forumu na visoki ravni, do končnih razprav na Generalni skupščini OZN leta 2014 o globalnih ciljih za izkoreninjenje revščine in trajnostni razvoj. Zdaj bolj kot kdaj koli prej moramo priznati osrednjo vlogo enakosti spolov, zdaj bolj kot kdaj koli prej moramo končati neenakost spolov kot glavni cilj 21. stoletja.<br/><br/>Spodbujanje enakosti spolov v agendi za obdobje po letu 2015 vključuje dokončanje dela, ki se je začelo z razvojnimi cilji tisočletja. Na žalost so razvojni cilji tisočletja najbolj nezadostni tisti, ki so neposredno povezani z doseganjem enakosti spolov, kot je zmanjšanje umrljivosti mater in zagotavljanje splošnega reproduktivnega zdravja in pravic. Obstajajo že obsežni dokazi, da neenakost spolov močno omejuje neodvisnost in svobodo žensk, nadzor nad njihovimi telesi, spolnostjo in plodnostjo ter omejuje njihove življenjske izbire in priložnosti v smislu izobraževanja in dela. Obstajajo tudi številni dokazi, da znatno upočasnjuje gospodarsko rast tako v bogatih kot v revnih državah.<br/><br/>Po vsem svetu se ženske in dekleta v vseh družbah dosledno soočajo z različnimi ovirami za enakost, kot so razlike v plačah, nasilje na podlagi spola, otroške poroke in pohabljanje ženskih spolnih organov. Revni in drugače socialno prikrajšani so še bolj marginalizirani zaradi pohabljenih kombinacij diskriminacije na podlagi spola in diskriminacije zaradi revščine. Zato mora biti odpravljanje neenakosti med spoloma in kritičnih ovir, ki ženskam in dekletom preprečujejo uresničevanje njihovih pravic in krepitev vloge, v središču naših prizadevanj za ustvarjanje trajnostnih, uspešnih in odpornih družb.<br/><br/>Doseganje enakosti spolov - vključno s pravicami žensk, zdravjem žensk in opolnomočenjem žensk - ni le sredstvo za izkoreninjenje revščine in doseganje trajnostnega razvoja, ampak je pomemben cilj sam po sebi.<br/><br/>Pomembni dokumenti, kot so Konvencija o odpravi vseh oblik diskriminacije žensk (CEDAW), Akcijski program Mednarodne konference o prebivalstvu in razvoju ter Pekinška deklaracija in platforma za ukrepanje, že dolgo potrjujejo, da so pravice žensk človekove pravice. CEDAW, ki je bila ustanovljena leta 1979 in jo je ratificirala skoraj vsaka država na svetu, postavlja odgovornost za zagotavljanje enakih pravic moških in žensk z državo. Ženskam je treba zagotoviti enak dostop do vseh vidikov življenja kot moškim, da bi dosegle enak status.<br/><br/>Tega še nismo dosegli. Zato priporočamo, da Generalna skupščina Združenih narodov razmisli o učinkovitem reševanju tega izziva in nedokončanih zadev razvojnih ciljev tisočletja, tako da zagotovi, da bodo enakost spolov ter spolno in reproduktivno zdravje v središču razvojne agende po letu 2015, pri čemer bodo ustrezni cilji, cilji in kazalniki odobreni.<br/><br/>Ta predlog močno podpirajo številne zainteresirane strani in razvojni akterji, vključno s številnimi vladami, večstranskimi agencijami in organizacijami civilne družbe. Na ustreznih nacionalnih, regionalnih in globalnih tematskih posvetovanjih o zdravju, neenakostih in izobraževanju v agendi za obdobje po letu 2015 ter v okviru za ukrepanje in nadaljnje ukrepanje iz dokumenta o izidu konference Rio+20 sta bila poudarjena osrednja pomena enakosti spolov in krepitve vloge žensk.<br/><br/>Razvojni cilji tisočletja so v zadnjih letih ustvarili brez primere mobilizacijo politične volje in virov, nenazadnje v zvezi z razvojnimi cilji tisočletja 4 in 5, ki so povezani z zmanjšanjem umrljivosti mater in dojenčkov. Oba cilja sta neločljivo povezana z enakostjo spolov ter pravicami, zdravjem in opolnomočenjem žensk in deklet. Bistveno je, da se naša skupna prizadevanja glede teh ciljev prenesejo in dodatno okrepijo v agendo za obdobje po letu 2015. Vključitev ciljev na področju enakosti spolov ter spolnega in reproduktivnega zdravja in pravic v agendo za obdobje po letu 2015 bo ponovno poudarila osrednjo vlogo pravic žensk kot človekovih pravic. Poročilo odbora je dalo močan zagon tem vprašanjem - zdaj je na vseh nas, globalnih akterjih, da ga ohranimo in zagotovimo, da bo preživel vse do leta 2015.<br/><br/>Smo na odločilni točki v naši skupni zgodovini, ko bodo naši politični nameni in dejanja oblikovali prihodnost človeškega razvoja in našega planeta pred dosežki brez primere in stalnimi izzivi. Zagotovimo, da je agenda za obdobje po letu 2015 resnično univerzalna in vključujoča ter da je končni cilj svet, v katerem so vsi - moški, ženske, mladi in otroci - obravnavani kot enako vredni objektivi, primerni za splošno makro delo, če pa želite večjo razdaljo od subjekta do objektiva, vam bo objektiv 100 mm dal to za svojo ceno.

| How Mobile Games Can Help Improve Sanitation<br/><br/>More than 2.5 billion people, many of them in Africa and South Asia, face grave sanitation challenges. In many of these countries, people are more likely to own a cell phone than a toilet. Therefore there is an obvious opportunity to use mobile technology to promote the use of sanitation and good hygiene in order to make a substantial impact. Mobile phones in Kenya transfer money; Bangladeshis listen to English language classes on their phones; and in Ghana, women entrepreneurs use mobiles to market their wares.<br/><br/>The growing Games for Change industry applies principles of traditional social games to address specific challenges . For example, in the UK, Channel 4 commissioned the game developer Playniac to build an online game to improve financial literacy among the 50% of young Britons who are heavily in debt. In Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, young developers have built iPhone, Android, and Javascript games based on local storylines. Pledge 51, a Nigerian developer group, recently released Danfo, a game where the user plays as a bus driver coping with dense Nigerian traffic.<br/><br/>Hattery Labs has begun to explore how games might improve sanitation practices. The typical game-players in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia are young urban males who own smartphones, but many of the communities that face the greatest sanitation challenges have less advanced technology. However, Javascript games built for Nokia S40 phones (among the most popular handsets in the developing world) provide an opportunity to send a compelling message on good behavior practices in sanitation and hygiene. A full report on how games can promote good sanitation and behavior practice is HERE.<br/><br/>Here are a few game ideas that might prove effective:<br/><br/>Soap Wars makes hand-washing an entertaining challenge where players use the soap dispenser as a weapon against dangerous germs. Sanitation Heroes engages players in the process of sanitation maintenance from capturing, transporting, and disposing of feces to reusing it as fertilizer. It features different scenarios in a memory game that prompts the player to match the solution to each different stage of capturing and treating waste.<br/><br/>Toilet Hunt introduces obstacles along the course of finding a safe place to go to the bathroom. As the player searches for sanitary latrines on a basic map, they must use the clues to decide whether the latrine is safe.<br/><br/>There are outstanding questions that the current research hasn't resolved:<br/><br/>How does the game appeal to illiterate players, who need rich visual descriptions and narratives to guide the gameplay? The need for rich imagery does not necessarily match the small, low-resolution screens of Nokia S40 phones.<br/><br/>How does the game appeal to women, who are critical participants in sanitation but don't represent the largest percentage of mobile game players? One initial idea is to frame sanitation storylines as mobile 'comic books', allowing users to scroll through an interesting narrative with subtle sanitation and hygiene messages.<br/><br/>How can the lessons from the game translate to rural areas, where there are fewer who can access it and more who face the challenges that it seeks to mitigate? Urban users might take their phone with them to their home village and share it with their friends and family, who will begin playing the game and continue to play out the game's storyline in real life.<br/><br/>Finally, how can the game measure its impact on sanitation behavior? User adoption and engagement in this context is a false metric to evaluate impact since users might play the game but have their behavior unchanged. Any solution to measure impact should combine a mobile game with other digital and non-digital applications that help users track their sanitation use alongside their game success. Local developers can work in partnership with games for change experts, community organizations, and telecommunications companies to test these approaches.<br/><br/>This report explores the potential of using mobile games to engage citizens in addressing persistent community challenges but we want to hear from you. Is this an effective way to engage target populations? Are there other ideas for how games can impact behavior change? Would you play these games | Kako lahko mobilne igre pomagajo izboljšati sanitarije<br/><br/>Več kot 2,5 milijarde ljudi, od katerih jih je veliko v Afriki in Južni Aziji, se sooča z resnimi sanitarnimi izzivi. V mnogih teh državah so ljudje bolj verjetno, da imajo mobilni telefon kot stranišče. Zato obstaja očitna priložnost za uporabo mobilne tehnologije za spodbujanje uporabe sanitarij in dobre higiene, da bi dosegli znaten učinek. Mobilni telefoni v Keniji prenašajo denar; Bangladeščani poslušajo tečaje angleškega jezika na svojih telefonih; in v Gani ženske podjetnice uporabljajo mobilne telefone za trženje svojega blaga.<br/><br/>Rastoča industrija Igre za spremembe uporablja načela tradicionalnih družabnih iger za reševanje specifičnih izzivov . Na primer, v Veliki Britaniji je Channel 4 naročil razvijalcu iger Playniac, da zgradi spletno igro za izboljšanje finančne pismenosti med 50% mladih Britancev, ki so močno zadolženi. V podsaharski Afriki in Južni Aziji so mladi razvijalci zgradili iPhone, Android in Javascript igre, ki temeljijo na lokalnih zgodbah. Nigerijska razvijalska skupina Pledge 51 je pred kratkim izdala igro Danfo, kjer uporabnik igra kot voznik avtobusa, ki se spopada z gostim nigerijskim prometom.<br/><br/>Hattery Labs je začel raziskovati, kako lahko igre izboljšajo sanitarne prakse. Tipični igralci v podsaharski Afriki in Južni Aziji so mladi mestni moški, ki imajo pametne telefone, vendar imajo številne skupnosti, ki se soočajo z največjimi sanitarnimi izzivi, manj napredno tehnologijo. Vendar pa Javascript igre, zgrajene za telefone Nokia S40 (med najbolj priljubljenimi telefoni v svetu v razvoju), ponujajo priložnost, da pošljejo prepričljivo sporočilo o dobrih praksah vedenja v sanitarnih in higienskih razmerah. Celotno poročilo o tem, kako lahko igre spodbujajo dobro sanitarno in vedenjsko prakso, je TUKAJ.<br/><br/>Tukaj je nekaj iger, ki se lahko izkažejo za učinkovite:<br/><br/>Milo Wars naredi ročno pranje zabaven izziv, kjer igralci uporabljajo razpršilnik za milo kot orožje proti nevarnim mikroorganizmom. Sanitation Heroes vključuje igralce v proces vzdrževanja sanitarij, od zajemanja, prevoza in odstranjevanja iztrebkov do ponovne uporabe kot gnojilo. Ponaša se z različnimi scenariji v spominski igri, ki od igralca zahteva, da se ujema z rešitvijo za vsako stopnjo zajemanja in obdelave odpadkov.<br/><br/>Toilet Hunt uvaja ovire ob iskanju varnega kraja za kopalnico. Ko igralec išče sanitarne latrine na osnovnem zemljevidu, mora uporabiti namige, da se odloči, ali je latrina varna.<br/><br/>Obstajajo odprta vprašanja, ki jih sedanje raziskave niso rešile:<br/><br/>Kako igra pritegne nepismene igralce, ki potrebujejo bogate vizualne opise in pripovedi za vodenje igranja? Potreba po bogatih slikah ne ustreza nujno majhnim zaslonom z nizko ločljivostjo telefonov Nokia S40.<br/><br/>Kako je igra privlačna za ženske, ki so kritični udeleženci v sanitarijah, vendar ne predstavljajo največjega odstotka igralcev mobilnih iger? Ena od začetnih idej je uokviriti sanitarne zgodbe kot mobilne "stripe", ki uporabnikom omogočajo, da se pomikajo skozi zanimivo pripoved s subtilnimi sanitarnimi in higienskimi sporočili.<br/><br/>Kako se lahko lekcije iz igre prenesejo na podeželska območja, kjer je manj ljudi, ki lahko dostopajo do igre, in več tistih, ki se soočajo z izzivi, ki jih poskuša ublažiti? Urbani uporabniki lahko vzamejo svoj telefon s seboj v svojo domačo vas in ga delijo s prijatelji in družino, ki bodo začeli igrati igro in še naprej igrali zgodbo igre v resničnem življenju.<br/><br/>Končno, kako lahko igra meri svoj vpliv na sanitarno vedenje? Uporabniško sprejetje in sodelovanje v tem kontekstu je napačna meritev za oceno vpliva, saj lahko uporabniki igrajo igro, vendar je njihovo vedenje nespremenjeno. Vsaka rešitev za merjenje učinka mora združevati mobilno igro z drugimi digitalnimi in nedigitalnimi aplikacijami, ki uporabnikom pomagajo spremljati njihovo uporabo sanitarij skupaj z uspehom iger. Lokalni razvijalci lahko sodelujejo s strokovnjaki za spremembe, organizacijami skupnosti in telekomunikacijskimi podjetji, da preizkusijo te pristope.<br/><br/>To poročilo raziskuje potencial uporabe mobilnih iger za vključevanje državljanov v reševanje vztrajnih izzivov skupnosti, vendar želimo slišati od vas. Ali je to učinkovit način za vključevanje ciljne populacije? Ali obstajajo druge ideje o tem, kako lahko igre vplivajo na spremembo vedenja? Bi igrali te igre |
| Sculpins, form a large family (300 species) of small northern fishes living on the bottom in both marine and fresh waters. Though primarily found in shallow waters, some species occur in depths to 1280 m. Approximately 16 species of sculpins exist from the Canadian Atlantic area. The se raven, longhorn, and shorthorn sculpin are the most popular species found in Newfoundland waters. Also known as gurnets, they are sometimes incorrectly called sea robins, grondin and gurnards, which are close relatives.<br/><br/>Sea Scallops: (Placopecten magellanicus)<br/><br/>Sea Scallops<br/><br/>They are also called giant or smooth scallops, are the most important commercial species of molluscan shellfish in Canada. They have two round shells, (with the commercial shell size ranging from 15 to 20 cm in diameter) nad are cream in color.<br/><br/>Sea scallops are found in the northwest Atlantic from the northern part of the Gulf of St. Lawrence to the coastal waters of North Carolina in the United States. In the northern part of this range, they occur in shallow water (less than 18 m) while in the southern portion, they are found in water deeper than 55 m.<br/><br/>The offshore fishery occurs on Georges Bank off the southwestern tip of Nova Scotia. Depending on the area, scallop fishing can be conducted on a year-round basis.<br/><br/>Sei Whale: (Balaenoptera borealis)<br/><br/>Too big to fit in one photo<br/><br/>14 meters; 13 tons.<br/><br/>The sei whale is often confused with the larger blue and fin whales. Its blow is similar to that of a fin whale, but lower and the sei's dorsal fin is more hooked.<br/><br/>The sei shows little of itself when surfacing, although it may poke its head out of the water, it only arches its back slightly and does not show its flukes before quietly submerging. The sei whale is all one slate gray color on top and may be lighter gray underneath.<br/><br/>Look for several blows in succession as the sei lays on the surface resting between its dives. It may be seen in groups of two to five off Newfoundland.<br/><br/>Shrimp (Pandalus borealis )<br/><br/>The little guy<br/><br/>During the 1990s, carapace length statistics of northern shrimp decreased in commercial and survey catches off Newfoundland and Labrador. Decreased growth rates caused by decreases in per-capita food availability due to large population increases, exacerbated by increased metabolic demands from higher water temperatures in the mid-1990s, appear to be the main cause of the size decrease. Fishing could have had an accelerating effect on environmentally driven decreases in shrimp growth and size by 'cropping' the largest shrimp from the population. The greatest decreases in shrimp size occurred in Hudson Strait and the adjacent northern shelf, the area which also has the highest densities and largest shrimp.<br/><br/>Silver Hake (Merluccius bilinearis)<br/><br/>Silver Hake<br/><br/>Silver Hake (Merluccius bilinearis)<br/><br/>Silver hake are members of the cod family, but are more slender and have two dorsal fins. They are dark gray with silver underparts. When freshly taken from the water, they are silvery iridescent, but the bright colour soon fades. Fish in the catch range from 20 to 30 cm in length and weigh between 0.1 and 0.3 kg.<br/><br/>Occurring from the Grand Banks to South Carolina, silver hake are mainly found on Georges Bank and on the Nova Scotia Banks, particularly on Browns Bank and the Sable Island Banks in depths of 55 to 275 m. Silver hake are generally found in the warmer waters of the Canadian Atlantic (7 to 10° C).<br/><br/>Formerly under-utilized in the Canadian fisheries and harvested mainly by fleets of other nations, silver hake were fished almost exclusively by Canadians using otter trawls in the late 1990s.<br/><br/>Silver Hake is sold in Baltimore as Lake Trout.<br/><br/>Skate (Raja senta) [smooth] (Raja radiata) [thorny]<br/><br/>An unpopular sea creature<br/><br/>The analysis of data for the St. Pierre Bank, which is to the south of Newfoundland, shows the average number of barndoor skate fell from about 0.6 million in the 1950s to fewer than 500 in the 1970s Meanwhile, smaller skate species, namely the horny skate and the smooth skate increased in biomass during the same interval. No barndoor skate have been caught on the St. Pierre Bank since the 1970s.<br/><br/>Smelt (Osmerus mordax)<br/><br/>Tiny Fish for Japan<br/><br/>Native to Newfoundland and Labrador. In the spring the sexually mature ripe smelt will leave either the sea or large lakes and travel up streams to spawn. In Newfoundland this can occur when the ice is still on many of the lakes. However, usually this occurs in March, April or May. The precise time depending on latitude and temperature, usually 8.90C is optimal.<br/><br/>It should be noted that the precise time of spawning is quite specific to the individual stream.<br/><br/>Spawning may last up to three weeks, but the peak seldom lasts more than a week. Spawning takes place at night with spawners returning to the lake or ocean by day . The length of both sexes will decrease in size as the period for spawning progresses. Two males will align themselves on either side of a ripe female. The female releases her eggs in clusters, with the milk of both males being released simultaneously. Eggs become adhesive shortly after extrusion, and attach to bottom gravel.<br/><br/>Snow Crab (Chionoecetes opilio)<br/><br/>Snow Crab<br/><br/>Snow crabs are common in the estuary and the Gulf of St. Lawrence, around Cape Breton Island and in the bays of Newfoundland, from Fortune Bay to White Bay. They are also found near Hamilton Bank off Labrador.<br/><br/>Snow crabs live most commonly on muddy or sand-mud bottoms at temperatures ranging from -0.5 to 4.5°C. In the Gulf of St. Lawrence, they are usually found at depths of 70 to 140 m, while in Cape Breton the depth varies from 45 to 245 m, and 170 to 380 m off Newfoundland. The distribution of small crabs is not well documented but they are occasionally found with the adults, or on gravelly bottoms at shallower depths. In some areas, there are indications that snow crabs move from gravel bottom to mud bottom, usually in deeper waters, as they reach maturity.<br/><br/>Sowerby's Beaked Whale (Mesopolodon bidens)<br/><br/>Where's the sexy lifeguard?<br/><br/>5 meters; 1.5 tons<br/><br/>It is also known as the north sea beaked whale, a rare whale of which little is known. It is thought to be mid-ocean whale which occasionally strays inshore feeding on squid and cod<br/><br/>The majority of whale strandings in the Western north Atlantic have occurred in Newfoundland and Labrador.<br/><br/>The Sowerby's is slate gray on the dorsal side and lighter gray on the ventral region. In adult males two teeth are often seen about one third of the way back on the beak erupted outside the mouth. The beak is around 50 cm long. One onlooker said the head looks like a thermos.<br/><br/>Sperm Whale: (Physeter catadon)<br/><br/>No jokes, please.<br/><br/>13 meters; 28 tons<br/><br/>The largest of the toothed whales is often referred to as "Moby Dick." Located at the front of its head, the single blowhole sends a slanted 5-meter misty spray out 45 degrees from its body. Its massive square head and the series of bumps that replace its dorsal fin easily identify the sperm whale It is slate gray. Sperm whales, like the humpback, will throw their tails high into the air when diving.<br/><br/>They are found offshore hunting for squid in deep water, but occasionally can be seen inshore singly or in small groups. | Sculpins, tvorijo veliko družino (300 vrst) majhnih severnih rib, ki živijo na dnu tako v morskih kot sladkih vodah. Čeprav se večinoma nahajajo v plitvih vodah, se nekatere vrste pojavljajo v globinah do 1280 m. Približno 16 vrst skulpinov obstaja iz kanadskega atlantskega območja. Raven, dolgorog in kratkorog skulpin so najbolj priljubljene vrste, ki jih najdemo v vodah Newfoundlanda. Znani tudi kot gurneti, se včasih nepravilno imenujejo morski robini, grondini in gurnardi, ki so bližnji sorodniki.<br/><br/>morske školjke: (Placopecten magellanicus)<br/><br/>Morski kosmiči<br/><br/>Imenujejo se tudi velikanske ali gladke školjke, so najpomembnejše komercialne vrste školjk v Kanadi. Imajo dve okrogli lupini (s komercialno velikostjo školjke od 15 do 20 cm v premeru) in so kremne barve.<br/><br/>Morske školjke najdemo v severozahodnem Atlantiku od severnega dela zaliva St. Lawrence do obalnih voda Severne Karoline v Združenih državah Amerike. V severnem delu tega območja se pojavljajo v plitvih vodah (manj kot 18 m), v južnem delu pa v vodi, globlji od 55 m.<br/><br/>Ribolov na morju poteka na Georges Banku na jugozahodnem koncu Nove Škotske. Odvisno od območja se lahko ribolov na školjke izvaja celo leto.<br/><br/>Sei Whale: (Balaenoptera borealis)<br/><br/>Preveč velika, da bi se prilegala na eno fotografijo<br/><br/>14 metrov; 13 ton.<br/><br/>Sei kit se pogosto zamenjuje z večjimi modrimi in plavuti. Njegov udarec je podoben udarcu plavuti, vendar je nižji in hrbtna plavuti sei bolj ujeta.<br/><br/>Sei se malo pokaže, ko se pojavi na površju, čeprav lahko potegne glavo iz vode, le rahlo ukrivi hrbet in ne pokaže svojih flukes pred mirnim potapljanjem. Sei kit je vse eno skrilavca siva barva na vrhu in je lahko lažje siva spodaj.<br/><br/>Poglej za več udarcev zaporedoma, saj sei leži na površini, ki počiva med svojimi potopi. To je mogoče videti v skupinah od dveh do petih iz Newfoundlanda.<br/><br/>Kozice (Pandalus borealis)<br/><br/>Mali fantek<br/><br/>V devetdesetih letih prejšnjega stoletja se je statistika dolžine lupine severnih kozic zmanjšala v komercialnem in raziskovalnem ulovu ob Newfoundlandu in Labradorju. Zmanjšane stopnje rasti, ki so posledica zmanjšanja razpoložljivosti hrane na prebivalca zaradi velikega povečanja prebivalstva, poslabšane s povečanimi presnovnimi potrebami zaradi višjih temperatur vode sredi devetdesetih let prejšnjega stoletja, se zdijo glavni vzrok za zmanjšanje velikosti. Ribolov bi lahko imel pospešujoč učinek na okoljsko usmerjeno zmanjšanje rasti in velikosti kozic z »obrezovanjem« največjih kozic iz populacije. Največje zmanjšanje velikosti kozic se je zgodilo v Hudsonovi ožini in sosednjem severnem šelfu, območju, ki ima tudi največjo gostoto in največje kozice.<br/><br/>oslič (Merluccius bilinearis)<br/><br/>Srebrni oslič<br/><br/>oslič (Merluccius bilinearis)<br/><br/>Srebrni oslič so člani družine trsk, vendar so bolj vitki in imajo dve hrbtni plavuti. So temno sivi s srebrnimi spodnjimi deli. Ko so sveže vzeti iz vode, so srebrnkasti, vendar svetla barva kmalu zbledi. Ribe v ulovu so dolge od 20 do 30 cm in tehtajo od 0,1 do 0,3 kg.<br/><br/>Izhajajoč iz Grand Banks v Južni Karolini, srebrni oslič najdemo predvsem na Georges Bank in na Nova Scotia Banks, zlasti na Browns Bank in Sable Island Banks v globinah od 55 do 275 metrov. Srebrni oslič na splošno najdemo v toplejših vodah kanadskega Atlantika (7 do 10 ° C).<br/><br/>Nekoč premalo izkoriščena v kanadskem ribolovu in nabirana predvsem s flotami drugih narodov, so srebro osliča lovili skoraj izključno Kanadčani z vlečnimi mrežami za vidre v poznih 1990-ih.<br/><br/>Silver Hake se prodaja v Baltimoru kot Lake Trout.<br/><br/>Skate (Raja senta) [gladka] (Raja radiata) [trnjena]<br/><br/>Nepriljubljeno morsko bitje<br/><br/>Analiza podatkov za banko St. Pierre Bank, ki je južno od Newfoundlanda, kaže, da se je povprečno število drsalk padlo s približno 0,6 milijona v 1950-ih na manj kot 500 v 1970-ih Medtem so se manjše vrste drsalk, in sicer rožnate drsalke in gladke drsalke, v istem intervalu povečale v biomasi. Nobena drsalka ni bila ulovljena na banki St. Pierre od sedemdesetih let prejšnjega stoletja.<br/><br/>Smelt (Osmerus mordax)<br/><br/>Majhne ribe za Japonsko<br/><br/>Domači v Newfoundlandu in Labradorju. Spomladi bo spolno zrel vonj zapustil bodisi morje ali velika jezera in potoval potoke, da se razmnožijo. V Newfoundlandu se to lahko zgodi, ko je led še vedno na mnogih jezerih. Vendar pa se to običajno zgodi v marcu, aprilu ali maju. Natančen čas, odvisen od zemljepisne širine in temperature, je običajno 8.90C.<br/><br/>Treba je opozoriti, da je natančen čas drstenja precej specifičen za posamezni tok.<br/><br/>Drstenje lahko traja do tri tedne, vendar vrh redko traja več kot teden dni. Drstenje poteka ponoči, pri čemer se drsteči podnevi vrnejo v jezero ali ocean . Dolžina obeh spolov se bo zmanjšala v velikosti, saj obdobje drstenja napreduje. Dva samca se bosta poravnala na obeh straneh zrele samice. Samica sprosti svoja jajca v grozde, pri čemer se mleko obeh samcev sprosti hkrati. Jajca postanejo lepljiva kmalu po ekstrudiranju in se pritrdijo na spodnji gramoz.<br/><br/>Snežni rak (Chionoecetes opilio)<br/><br/>Snežni rak<br/><br/>Snežni raki so pogosti v estuariju in zalivu St. Lawrence, okoli otoka Cape Breton in v zalivih Newfoundlanda, od Fortune Baya do White Baya. Najdemo jih tudi v bližini Hamilton Bank off Labrador.<br/><br/>Snežne rake najpogosteje živijo na blatnem ali peščenem blatu pri temperaturah od -0,5 do 4,5 ° C. V zalivu St. Lawrence se običajno nahajajo na globinah od 70 do 140 m, medtem ko se v Cape Bretonu globina giblje od 45 do 245 m in od 170 do 380 m od Newfoundlanda. Porazdelitev majhnih rakov ni dobro dokumentirana, vendar jih občasno najdemo pri odraslih ali na prodnatem dnu na plitvih globinah. Na nekaterih območjih obstajajo znaki, da se snežne rake premikajo od prodnatega dna do blatnega dna, običajno v globljih vodah, ko dosežejo zrelost.<br/><br/>Sowerby's Beaked Whale (Mezopolodon bidens)<br/><br/>Kje je seksi reševalec?<br/><br/>5 metrov; 1,5 tone<br/><br/>Znan je tudi kot severnomorski kit, redek kit, o katerem je malo znano. Menijo, da je kit sredi oceana, ki občasno zaide na obalo, ki se hrani z lignji in trsko.<br/><br/>Večina naselij kitov v zahodnem severnem Atlantiku se je zgodila na Newfoundlandu in Labradorju.<br/><br/>Sowerby's je na hrbtni strani skrilavca siva in na trebušni regiji svetlejša siva. Pri odraslih moških se pogosto vidita dva zoba približno tretjino poti nazaj na kljun, ki je izbruhnil zunaj ust. Kljun je dolg približno 50 cm. Eden od opazovalcev je rekel, da glava izgleda kot termos.<br/><br/>Sperma kita: (Physeter catadon)<br/><br/>Brez šal, prosim.<br/><br/>13 metrov; 28 ton<br/><br/>Največji od zobatih kitov se pogosto imenuje "Moby Dick". Nahaja se na sprednji strani glave, ena pihalna luknja pošlje poševno 5-metrsko megleno pršenje iz telesa 45 stopinj. Njegova masivna kvadratna glava in niz udarcev, ki nadomeščajo hrbtno plavuti, zlahka prepoznajo kita sperme. Sperma kitov, kot grbavec, bo med potapljanjem vrgla svoje repe visoko v zrak.<br/><br/>Najdemo jih na morju, kjer lovijo lignje v globokih vodah, občasno pa jih lahko vidimo na kopnem posamezno ali v majhnih skupinah. |
