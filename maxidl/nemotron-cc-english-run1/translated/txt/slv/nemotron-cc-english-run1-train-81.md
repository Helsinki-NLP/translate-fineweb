| Forty-nine years ago today, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act of 1965.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Nearly a century ago, the 15th Amendment to the Constitution stated, "The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of race, color or previous condition of servitude." And nearly a century before that, our nation's founding fathers set in motion the great experiment of American democracy by declaring that "all men are created equal."<br/><br/>The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was a belated acknowledgment that even in America, our foundational ideals carry little weight if not protected by the rule of law. That's why Section 2 of the 15th Amendment granted Congress the "power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation."<br/><br/>And indeed, the codified language of the Voting Rights Act was able to achieve what the Reconstruction-era Congress and Thomas Jefferson could not. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act—and the civil rights movement from which they emerged—served as the catalyst for a dramatic increase in the opportunity for black Americans to participate in the democratic process.<br/><br/>For example, only 6.7 percent of eligible black Mississippians were registered to vote as of 1962; by 1969 that figure had reached 66.5 percent. Today, Mississippi has more black elected officials than any other state.<br/><br/>The protections put in place by the Voting Rights Act were long overdue when they were passed, representative of the arduous struggle with which they were achieved. But unthinkably, these protections are now under assault, jeopardizing the progress our nation worked so hard to achieve.<br/><br/>Last year, in the case of Shelby County v. Holder, the U.S. Supreme Court gutted a key component of the Voting Rights Act that enabled prior federal review to ensure nondiscrimination before any new voting law went into effect.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Sadly, the response of Republican leaders has been to do nothing. Sen. Ted Cruz and Gov. Rick Perry went out of their way to praise the Supreme Court's decision. Sen. Rand Paul dismissed the continued necessity of the Voting Rights Act by noting, "We have an African-American president."<br/><br/>While the election of President Barack Obama was indeed a historic milestone, it is dangerous to think that it absolves us from remaining vigilant against the lingering consequences of our nation's past. The haste with which states have moved to enact voting restrictions is confirmation that the protections put in place by Section 4 are still necessary.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Republican governors have signed strict photo-identification restrictions into law as the solution to a virtually nonexistent problem of voter impersonation, disproportionately hurting women, young people, working families and the African-American community. It's disingenuous for Republicans like Paul to seek the votes of these communities when they believe "there's nothing wrong with" putting restrictions in place that make it harder for these constituencies to vote.<br/><br/>Republicans have also sought to restrict early-voting periods, including the Sunday before Election Day, when African-American churches have had great success with Souls to the Polls programs.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>These restrictions represent a callous effort by Republicans to make voting harder, based on narrow, short-term political calculations that Republicans can win elections by shrinking the size of the electorate.<br/><br/>Democrats have a very different mission when it comes to voting: to ensure that every eligible voter can register, that every registered voter can vote and that every vote is accurately counted.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>The Democratic National Committee's Voter Expansion Project reflects our belief that greater voter participation strengthens our nation and our democracy. We'll continue to use our unmatched institutional knowledge to protect voting rights against legislation and tactics that would attempt to suppress the vote. And because the best defense is a good offense, we're also working to expand the vote by deploying our technology and data resources to register new voters.<br/><br/>On this anniversary, one of the best ways we can honor those who struggled—and in some cases gave their very lives—for the legislation's passage is for Republicans in Congress to join Democrats in passing the Voting Rights Amendment Act to restore the promise of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Democrat, represents Florida's 23rd Congressional District in the United States Congress. Since 2011, she has served as chair of the Democratic National Committee. Follow her on Twitter.<br/><br/>The Root aims to foster and advance conversations about issues relevant to the black Diaspora by presenting a variety of opinions from all perspectives, whether or not those opinions are shared by our editorial staff. | Pred devetinštiridesetimi leti je predsednik Lyndon B. Johnson podpisal zakon o volilni pravici iz leta 1965.<br/><br/>Oglaševanje<br/><br/>Pred skoraj stoletjem je 15. amandma k ustavi zapisal: "Pravica državljanov Združenih držav do glasovanja ne sme biti zavrnjena ali skrajšana s strani Združenih držav ali katere koli države zaradi rase, barve ali prejšnjega stanja suženjstva." Skoraj stoletje pred tem so ustanovni očetje našega naroda sprožili velik eksperiment ameriške demokracije z izjavo, da so "vsi ljudje ustvarjeni enaki".<br/><br/>Zakon o volilni pravici iz leta 1965 je bil zamudno priznanje, da imajo tudi v Ameriki naši temeljni ideali majhno težo, če niso zaščiteni z vladavino prava. Zato je drugi odstavek 15. amandmaja odobril kongresu "pooblastilo, da uveljavi ta člen z ustrezno zakonodajo".<br/><br/>In res, kodificirani jezik zakona o volilnih pravicah je bil sposoben doseči tisto, kar kongres iz obdobja obnove in Thomas Jefferson nista mogla. Zakon o državljanskih pravicah iz leta 1964 in zakon o volilni pravici - in gibanje za državljanske pravice, iz katerega so nastali - sta služila kot katalizator za dramatično povečanje možnosti črnih Američanov, da sodelujejo v demokratičnem procesu.<br/><br/>Leta 1962 je bilo na primer registriranih le 6,7 odstotka upravičenih črnih Mississippijevcev; do leta 1969 je ta številka dosegla 66,5 odstotka. Danes ima Mississippi več črnih izvoljenih uradnikov kot katera koli druga država.<br/><br/>Zaščita, uvedena z zakonom o glasovalnih pravicah, je bila dolgo zamujena, ko so bile sprejete, kar je predstavljalo težak boj, s katerim so bile dosežene. Toda nepredstavljivo je, da so te zaščite zdaj pod napadom, kar ogroža napredek, ki ga je naš narod tako trdo delal.<br/><br/>Lani je v primeru Shelby County proti Holderju ameriško vrhovno sodišče izločilo ključni sestavni del zakona o volilnih pravicah, ki je omogočil predhodni zvezni pregled, da bi zagotovil nediskriminacijo, preden bi začel veljati nov zakon o glasovanju.<br/><br/>Oglaševanje<br/><br/>Senator Ted Cruz in guverner Rick Perry sta pohvalila odločitev vrhovnega sodišča. Senator Rand Paul je zavrnil nadaljnjo potrebo po zakonu o volilni pravici, ko je zapisal: "Imamo afroameriškega predsednika."<br/><br/>Medtem ko je bila izvolitev predsednika Baracka Obame resnično zgodovinski mejnik, je nevarno misliti, da nas odpušča, da ostanemo pozorni na dolgotrajne posledice preteklosti našega naroda. Hitrost, s katero so se države premaknile k uveljavitvi omejitev glasovanja, je potrditev, da so zaščitni ukrepi, uvedeni s členom 4, še vedno potrebni.<br/><br/>Oglaševanje<br/><br/>Republikanski guvernerji so podpisali stroge omejitve foto-identifikacije v zakonu kot rešitev praktično neobstoječega problema oponašanja volivcev, ki nesorazmerno škoduje ženskam, mladim, delovnim družinam in afroameriški skupnosti. Za republikance, kot je Paul, je prevara, če iščejo glasove teh skupnosti, ko verjamejo, da "ni nič narobe z" uvedbo omejitev, ki otežujejo volitve v teh volilnih okrožjih.<br/><br/>Republikanci so si tudi prizadevali omejiti obdobja predčasnega glasovanja, vključno z nedeljo pred volilnim dnevom, ko so afroameriške cerkve imele velik uspeh s programi Souls na volitvah.<br/><br/>Oglaševanje<br/><br/>Te omejitve predstavljajo brezobzirno prizadevanje republikancev, da bi glasovanje težje, na podlagi ozkih, kratkoročnih političnih izračunov, da republikanci lahko zmagajo na volitvah z zmanjšanjem velikosti volilnega telesa.<br/><br/>Demokrati imajo zelo drugačno poslanstvo, ko gre za glasovanje: zagotoviti, da se lahko vsak upravičen volivec registrira, da lahko vsak registrirani volivec glasuje in da se vsak glas natančno prešteje.<br/><br/>Oglaševanje<br/><br/>Projekt širjenja volivcev Demokratičnega narodnega odbora odraža naše prepričanje, da večja udeležba volivcev krepi naš narod in našo demokracijo. Še naprej bomo uporabljali naše neprimerljivo institucionalno znanje za zaščito glasovalnih pravic pred zakonodajo in taktiko, ki bi poskušala zatreti glasovanje. In ker je najboljša obramba dober napad, si prizadevamo tudi za razširitev glasovanja z uporabo naše tehnologije in podatkovnih virov za registracijo novih volivcev.<br/><br/>Na to obletnico je eden najboljših načinov, kako lahko počastimo tiste, ki so se borili - in v nekaterih primerih dali svoja življenja - za prehod zakona je, da se republikanci v kongresu pridružijo demokratom v sprejetju zakona o spremembi glasovalnih pravic, da bi obnovili obljubo zakona o volilnih pravicah iz leta 1965.<br/><br/>Oglaševanje<br/><br/>Debbie Wasserman Schultz, demokratka, zastopa 23. kongresno okrožje Floride v kongresu Združenih držav.

| Q&A: Vatican safeguarding expert Fr Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>13 June 2021<br/><br/>Fr Hans Zollner SJ. Image: Australian Jesuits.<br/><br/>The President of the Centre for Child Protection at the Gregorian University in Rome, and a member of the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors, Fr Hans Zollner SJ, was in Australia in 2018 to speak to Catholic ministry leaders and survivors.<br/><br/>Michael McVeigh from Jesuit Communications sat down with him during the visit to explore how the Church is responding to the abuse crisis internationally, and what can be learned from our experiences in Australia.<br/><br/>MM: This is your third trip to Australia. You've visited quite a few other countries to see how the Church is responding to abuse around the world. Can you give us some idea of what the global picture looks like?<br/><br/>Fr Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>HZ: My understanding, after having visited about 50 countries on five or six continents, is that the Church is really starting to move over the last couple of years on the issue of doing justice to victims, of listening to them, and doing whatever can be done in terms of safeguarding.<br/><br/>I was with the Jesuit Provincials from all over Africa at the end of April, and the President of the Jesuit Assistancy of Africa and Madagascar is very much committed and dedicated to this. He has put up a thorough action plan for formation and for introducing guidelines all over the place. It's a very considerate and very deliberate effort to do whatever can be done to be proactively engaged as Jesuits in Africa — in a continent where until a few years ago all of this was a foreign language.<br/><br/>One of the challenges of trying to develop this global approach is that you're dealing with so many cultures, and so many different understandings. How do you bring this together and try to provide training and support religious communities tackling these issues?<br/><br/>This is one of the major questions we have. I think what I can do is stimulate discussion, stimulate reflection, and prepare people as much as possible so that they can do the groundwork.<br/><br/>The Centre for Child Protection at the Gregorian University does not pretend to have the response to every question. Not only because we don't know the specific contexts — we might know a few of them, but we're talking about thousands of cultures, we're talking about hundreds of languages, we're talking about very diverse legal backgrounds. It varies even sometimes within one country, such as Australia where you have states within the Commonwealth of Australia that have different laws than other states.<br/><br/>I am somebody who tries to elicit and stimulate discussion and reflection. I'm also very happy to listen to people.<br/><br/>You mentioned the need to listen and support victims in being heard. We've obviously had the Royal Commission here in Australia, but what are some of the other ways that you've seen that the voices of victims are being supported around the world?<br/><br/>In France there is one diocese that has established what they call 'The Listening Space'. There, victims can come forward and they can express themselves. The bishop is present. It's an open space in which people who have been hurt tremendously are free at least to express what they want to ask from the Church leadership etc.<br/><br/>There are other places in the USA or in other countries where victims have been invited by dioceses, by Provinces, by the leadership of the Church, to come forward. I have to say that overall I think there is a good will, and there are more people like bishops and provincials who listen to victims than we know. But there is no one model of giving victims not only the space to express themselves and be listened to, but also to engage actively in Church development.<br/><br/>In terms of setting up spaces for support for victims, what are some of the things you've seen that could really help — and that we could be considering here in Australia?<br/><br/>One of the major points that many victims bring up is, 'Can't we have, within parish settings, within schools settings, a regular conversation going on that includes survivors of abuse as regular members of a committee, a commission, a sounding board, a feedback group or something like that?' So that this voice is not only brought in on a specific occasion, or where a person feels like he or she is at a point to be able to speak out about it, but [is heard] on a regular basis — build that voice into the system.<br/><br/>That will help all of us. It will help survivors and victims because they will feel welcome and appreciated in the specific experience, and in the specific life challenges, that they went through. Secondly it will help the community at large, because we can at least make ourselves more and more sensitive to what the concerns and specific needs of survivors are — that can also talk to the needs of young people.<br/><br/>M: We have strong groups of survivors here in Australia who have been able to support each other through that process. But what you're saying is that we need some way of supporting those groups, and supporting those people, through our own institutions as well?<br/><br/>And I think we need to be creative. It will work for one school and one parish and one diocese in one way, and for others in a different way. Because the survivors with whom I am in constant contact, they have quite similar requests, and similar experiences in regard to being welcomed in the Church or not — feeling thrown out or dismissed. But they have also among themselves quite different expectations. So I have learned that you have also to be very forthcoming in accepting the differences in what this specific group, or this specific survivor, wants, requests and needs.<br/><br/>M: Survivors talk about wanting to have their stories heard and acknowledged. We've had the Royal Commission here in Australia, which provided an independent process where victims could come forward. Is there a need for something like that in terms of a truth, justice and reconciliation process for the Church internationally?<br/><br/>H: Yes, I think there is a need for that internationally. But I think first every local church needs to do its own homework. I don't see it happening very soon that some such council or commission would be established to look into this area for the whole Church. The Church has a membership of 1.3 billion people, and is present in 190 countries, with all kinds of differences in expectations concerning psychological, spiritual and financial support.<br/><br/>There is one thing that I have come across consistently in communicating with, working with and listening to victims, and that is that they want to be listened to. So if there was the feeling that victims were constantly being listened to — in Rome and elsewhere — I think that would give a great relief to many victims.<br/><br/>I think [Pope Francis'] concern, especially with regard to your question, is that the local churches do whatever they can so that victims will be listened to in that particular country. I have a list of people who want to speak to the Holy Father directly, and physically it is impossible. I was there in 2014 to translate for two German survivors who were chosen with two Irish and two English survivors when he received the six of them at home. He took the whole morning listening to them one after the other. For each one, he was there for 40 to 45 minutes. Were he to do this for every survivor he couldn't sleep anymore.<br/><br/>His example is modelling for the whole Catholic Church the way victims and survivors are received, welcomed and listened to. I think if the bishops and the provincials in this world, in all countries, followed his example, many survivors would be really appreciative of that.<br/><br/>Archbishop Diarmud Martin was recently quoted just before the World Meeting of Families, about the Pontifical Commission, saying that it's too small as it's currently set up to achieve what it needs to achieve. What's your take on that? Does the Church need to be putting more resources into how it's overseeing those issues?<br/><br/>At the moment we are 16 members from basically all continents, and the major language groups. We represent a variety of disciplines and professions, and the purpose of the commission — as the statutes that have just been promulgated state — is to provide counsel to the Holy Father.<br/><br/>A common misunderstanding about the commission is first that we deal with cases of allegations. That is not the case. We have no juridical or administrative power in regards to cases, because when it comes to allegations of abuse the tribunals and procedure are set.<br/><br/>A second misunderstanding is that we promote, directly, things on the ground. Our first and foremost goal is that we advise the Holy Father on issues.<br/><br/>So from my point of view, yes, we need to invest more. But we need to invest more on the local level, and we need to make sure that the proposals from the Pontifical Commission are forwarded to the Holy Father — which normally the President does — and then there is a follow-up process that reflects what we have given as our advice.<br/><br/>In Australia, Catholic Professional Standards Limited is overseeing the Church's response and providing guidelines and support for ensuring all the institutions in the Church are child-safe institutions. Is there a need for some kind of organisational support from Rome for those bishops and dioceses that are struggling to form these institutions and provide safeguarding in those dioceses?<br/><br/>I think ultimately the commission will develop in that line. They are now in the process of hiring experts in those areas.<br/><br/>I think the Church needs to understand that the local churches can learn from each other mutually. And my understanding has always been — and I think the Holy Father has reminded us — that the Church will not function as a centralised company. It does not work like that, effectively. Every bishop, every bishops conference, has, to some extent, its life on its own. What we need to learn more is to open channels of mutual communication.<br/><br/>There are a number of things that people blame for abuse in the Church. As a priest and a psychologist, and as someone who has met and worked with survivors, what are your thoughts on that issue?<br/><br/>I think the question of where does abuse come from is the most important one, and the Pope has addressed that in his letter to the people of God published on 20 August. He says in the first paragraph, and repeats it over and over again, that the question of sexual abuse is always linked — or almost always linked — not only to the question of abuse of power, but also to the abuse of conscience.<br/><br/>So the real fundamental question of abuse is much more complex than just [the question of] sexuality — be it heterosexual or homosexual. It's a power issue, and there we have to really work on the question of how do we understand priesthood, how to we understand bishophood, how do we understand and live out our ministries? What are the boundaries?<br/><br/>That's why I'm very happy that the Jesuit Province in Australia is establishing a Code of Conduct. Because we don't talk only about sexual abuse of minors. We talk about sexual abuse of adults, and we talk about abuse in other ways — like abuse of conscience, where you dictate to someone what you think, or you pretend to know by God, and you can tell another person, 'You need to do that', against the conscience of that person.<br/><br/>Many people think celibacy produces abuse. As I always say, celibacy as such is not cause for abusing — otherwise how do we explain that 99.9 per cent of all abusers do not live a celibate life, and how do we explain that 95 or 96 per cent of all priests do not abuse minors? But, celibacy, or a vow of chastity, that is not really integrated, that is not really lived out properly — yes, that produces a problem. Sometimes people take to drinking, sometime they take to gambling, and sometimes they take to sexual misconduct, with adults and with minors.<br/><br/>The real question about this is how do we deal with the notion of religious spiritual power with which priests and bishops are invested? How can theology help us to understand, and maybe how can sociology, psychology, or business administration help us to define the limits of power, and the necessity of keeping your boundaries | Vprašanja in odgovori: Vatikanski strokovnjak za varovanje oče Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>13. junij 2021<br/><br/>Fr Hans Zollner SJ. Slika: Avstralski jezuiti.<br/><br/>Predsednik Centra za zaščito otrok na Gregorijanski univerzi v Rimu in član Papeške komisije za zaščito mladoletnikov, Hans Zollner SJ, je bil leta 2018 v Avstraliji, da bi govoril voditeljem katoliške službe in preživelim.<br/><br/>Michael McVeigh iz Jezuitske komunikacije se je med obiskom usedel z njim, da bi raziskal, kako se Cerkev odziva na krizo zlorab na mednarodni ravni in kaj se lahko naučimo iz naših izkušenj v Avstraliji.<br/><br/>MM: To je vaše tretje potovanje v Avstralijo. Obiskali ste kar nekaj drugih držav, da bi videli, kako se Cerkev odziva na zlorabe po vsem svetu. Ali nam lahko podate kakšno idejo o tem, kako izgleda svetovna slika?<br/><br/>Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>HZ: Po mojem razumevanju, po obisku približno 50 držav na petih ali šestih celinah, se Cerkev v zadnjih nekaj letih resnično začenja premikati na temo zagotavljanja pravice žrtvam, poslušanja žrtev in delanja vsega, kar je mogoče storiti v smislu varovanja.<br/><br/>Konec aprila sem bil z jezuitskimi provinciali iz vse Afrike in predsednik jezuitske pomoči Afrike in Madagaskarja je temu zelo predan in predan. Pripravil je temeljit akcijski načrt za oblikovanje in uvedbo smernic povsod. To je zelo obziren in zelo nameren napor, da storimo vse, kar je mogoče, da se proaktivno vključimo kot jezuiti v Afriki - na celini, kjer je bilo do pred nekaj leti vse to tuji jezik.<br/><br/>Eden od izzivov pri poskušanju razviti ta globalni pristop je, da se ukvarjate s toliko kulturami in toliko različnimi razumevanji. Kako to združite in poskušate zagotoviti usposabljanje in podporo verskim skupnostim, ki se ukvarjajo s temi vprašanji?<br/><br/>To je eno od glavnih vprašanj, ki jih imamo, in mislim, da lahko spodbudim razpravo, spodbudim razmislek in pripravim ljudi, kolikor je mogoče, da bodo lahko opravili osnovno delo.<br/><br/>Center za varstvo otrok na Gregorijanski univerzi se ne pretvarja, da ima odgovor na vsako vprašanje. Ne samo zato, ker ne poznamo specifičnih kontekstov - morda jih poznamo nekaj, ampak govorimo o tisočih kulturah, govorimo o stotinah jezikov, govorimo o zelo različnih pravnih ozadjih. Včasih se razlikuje tudi znotraj ene države, kot je Avstralija, kjer imate države znotraj Avstralije, ki imajo drugačne zakone kot druge države.<br/><br/>Sem nekdo, ki poskuša izzvati in spodbuditi razpravo in razmišljanje. Prav tako sem zelo vesel, da poslušam ljudi.<br/><br/>Omenili ste potrebo po poslušanju in podpori žrtvam, da bi bile slišane. Očitno smo imeli Kraljevo komisijo tukaj v Avstraliji, toda kateri so nekateri drugi načini, na katere ste videli, da se glasovi žrtev podpirajo po vsem svetu?<br/><br/>V Franciji obstaja ena škofija, ki je ustanovila tisto, kar imenujejo "Prostor za poslušanje". Tam lahko žrtve pridejo in se lahko izrazijo. Škof je prisoten. Gre za odprt prostor, v katerem lahko ljudje, ki so bili zelo prizadeti, svobodno izrazijo vsaj to, kar želijo od cerkvenega vodstva itd.<br/><br/>Obstajajo tudi drugi kraji v ZDA ali drugih državah, kamor so škofije, province, vodstvo Cerkve povabile žrtve, da pridejo. Moram reči, da na splošno mislim, da obstaja dobra volja in da je več ljudi, kot so škofje in province, ki prisluhnejo žrtvam, kot jih poznamo. Vendar pa ni nobenega modela, da bi žrtvam dali ne le prostor za izražanje in poslušanje, ampak tudi za dejavno sodelovanje v razvoju Cerkve.<br/><br/>V smislu ustvarjanja prostorov za podporo žrtvam, kaj so nekatere stvari, ki ste jih videli, ki bi lahko resnično pomagale - in o katerih bi lahko razmišljali tukaj v Avstraliji?<br/><br/>Ena od glavnih točk, ki jih mnoge žrtve izpostavljajo, je: "Ali ne moremo v župnijskih prostorih, v šolskih prostorih, redno govoriti, da vključuje preživele zlorabe kot redni člani odbora, komisije, sondirnega odbora, skupine za povratne informacije ali kaj podobnega?" Tako, da se ta glas ne prinese samo ob določeni priložnosti, ali kjer se oseba počuti, kot da je na točki, da bi lahko govorila o tem, ampak [se sliši] redno - vgradite ta glas v sistem.<br/><br/>To bo pomagalo vsem nam, preživelim in žrtvam, saj se bodo počutili dobrodošle in cenjene v specifičnih izkušnjah in življenjskih izzivih, skozi katere so šli. Drugič, pomagalo bo širši skupnosti, saj lahko vsaj postanemo bolj občutljivi na skrbi in posebne potrebe preživelih, ki lahko govorijo tudi o potrebah mladih.<br/><br/>M: Tukaj v Avstraliji imamo močne skupine preživelih, ki so se lahko med seboj podpirale skozi ta proces. Toda pravite, da potrebujemo način, da podpremo te skupine in te ljudi, tudi prek naših lastnih institucij?<br/><br/>In mislim, da moramo biti ustvarjalni. Delovalo bo za eno šolo in eno župnijo in eno škofijo na en način, za druge pa na drugačen način. Ker imajo preživeli, s katerimi sem v stalnem stiku, zelo podobne prošnje in podobne izkušnje glede tega, ali so sprejeti v Cerkvi ali ne – občutek zavrženosti ali zavrženosti. Toda tudi med seboj imajo precej različna pričakovanja. Tako sem se naučil, da morate biti tudi zelo odprti pri sprejemanju razlik v tem, kaj ta posebna skupina ali ta specifični preživeli želi, zahteva in potrebuje.<br/><br/>M: Preživeli govorijo o želji, da bi bile njihove zgodbe slišane in priznane. Imeli smo Kraljevo komisijo tukaj v Avstraliji, ki je zagotovila neodvisen proces, kjer bi se žrtve lahko predstavile. Ali obstaja potreba po nečem podobnem v smislu resnice, pravičnosti in spravnega procesa za Cerkev na mednarodni ravni?<br/><br/>H: Da, mislim, da je to potrebno na mednarodni ravni, vendar mislim, da mora najprej vsaka krajevna cerkev opraviti svojo domačo nalogo. Ne verjamem, da se bo kmalu zgodilo, da bi bil ustanovljen kakšen takšen koncil ali komisija, ki bi preučevala to področje za vso Cerkev. Cerkev ima 1,3 milijarde članov in je prisotna v 190 državah, z vsemi vrstami razlik v pričakovanjih glede psihološke, duhovne in finančne podpore.<br/><br/>Obstaja ena stvar, s katero sem se dosledno srečevala pri komuniciranju, delu in poslušanju žrtev, in to je, da želijo biti slišane. Če bi torej obstajal občutek, da se žrtvam nenehno prisluhne – v Rimu in drugod – mislim, da bi to veliko olajšalo mnoge žrtve.<br/><br/>Mislim, da [papeža Frančiška] skrbi, zlasti glede vašega vprašanja, da krajevne cerkve storijo vse, kar je v njihovi moči, da bodo žrtve v tej državi prisluhnile. Imam seznam ljudi, ki želijo govoriti neposredno s Svetim očetom, in fizično je to nemogoče. Tam sem bil leta 2014, da bi prevedel za dva nemška preživela, ki sta bila izbrana z dvema irskima in dvema angleškima preživelima, ko je šest od njih prejel doma. Za vsakega je bil tam 40 do 45 minut. Če bi to storil za vsakega preživelega, ne bi mogel več spati.<br/><br/>Njegov zgled je zgled celotni katoliški Cerkvi, kako so žrtve in preživeli sprejeti, sprejeti in prisluhniti. Mislim, da bi bili mnogi preživeli, če bi škofje in provinciali v tem svetu, v vseh deželah, sledili njegovemu zgledu, resnično hvaležni za to.<br/><br/>Tik pred svetovnim srečanjem družin je bil pred kratkim citiran nadškof Diarmud Martin, ki je o Papeški komisiji dejal, da je premajhna, saj je trenutno vzpostavljena, da bi dosegla tisto, kar mora doseči. Ali mora Cerkev vlagati več sredstev v to, kako nadzoruje ta vprašanja?<br/><br/>Trenutno nas je 16 članov s skoraj vseh celin in glavnih jezikovnih skupin. Zastopamo različne discipline in poklice, namen komisije pa je – kot so pravkar razglašeni statuti – svetovati Svetemu očetu.<br/><br/>Pogost nesporazum glede komisije je, da se najprej ukvarjamo s primeri obtožb. V zadevah nimamo nobene pravne ali upravne pristojnosti, kajti ko gre za obtožbe o zlorabi, so določena sodišča in postopki.<br/><br/>Drugi nesporazum je, da neposredno spodbujamo stvari na terenu. Naš prvi in najpomembnejši cilj je, da svetujemo Svetemu očetu o zadevah.<br/><br/>Torej, po mojem mnenju, da, moramo vlagati več. Vendar pa moramo več vlagati na lokalni ravni in poskrbeti, da bodo predlogi Papeške komisije posredovani Svetemu očetu, kar običajno počne predsednik, nato pa sledi proces, ki odraža tisto, kar smo dali kot naš nasvet.<br/><br/>V Avstraliji Catholic Professional Standards Limited nadzoruje odziv Cerkve in zagotavlja smernice in podporo za zagotovitev, da so vse institucije v Cerkvi varne za otroke. Ali je potrebna nekakšna organizacijska podpora iz Rima za tiste škofe in škofije, ki se borijo za oblikovanje teh institucij in zagotavljanje varovanja v teh škofijah?<br/><br/>Menim, da se bo Komisija na koncu razvila v tej smeri in da so zdaj v postopku zaposlovanja strokovnjakov na teh področjih.<br/><br/>Mislim, da mora Cerkev razumeti, da se lahko krajevne cerkve učijo drug od drugega, in moje razumevanje je bilo vedno – in mislim, da nas je Sveti oče spomnil – da Cerkev ne bo delovala kot centralizirana družba. Ne deluje tako učinkovito. Vsak škof, vsaka škofovska konferenca, ima do neke mere svoje življenje. Kar se moramo naučiti več, je, da odpremo kanale medsebojnega komuniciranja.<br/><br/>Obstajajo številne stvari, ki jih ljudje krivijo za zlorabe v Cerkvi. Kot duhovnik in psiholog in kot nekdo, ki se je srečal in delal s preživelimi, kaj mislite o tem vprašanju?<br/><br/>Mislim, da je najpomembnejše vprašanje, od kod prihaja zloraba, in to je papež naslovil v svojem pismu Božjemu ljudstvu, ki je bilo objavljeno 20. avgusta. V prvem odstavku pravi in to ponavlja znova in znova, da je vprašanje spolne zlorabe vedno povezano – ali skoraj vedno povezano – ne le z vprašanjem zlorabe oblasti, ampak tudi z zlorabo vesti.<br/><br/>Resnično temeljno vprašanje zlorabe je torej veliko bolj zapleteno kot samo vprašanje spolnosti – naj bo to heteroseksualno ali homoseksualno. To je vprašanje moči, in tam moramo resnično delati na vprašanju, kako razumeti duhovništvo, kako razumeti škofovstvo, kako razumeti in živeti naše službe? Kakšne so meje?<br/><br/>Zato sem zelo vesel, da jezuitska provinca v Avstraliji vzpostavlja kodeks ravnanja, ker ne govorimo samo o spolnih zlorabah mladoletnikov. Govorimo o spolni zlorabi odraslih in govorimo o zlorabi na druge načine - kot je zloraba vesti, kjer narekujete nekomu, kaj mislite, ali se pretvarjate, da veste od Boga, in lahko rečete drugi osebi, "To morate storiti", proti vesti te osebe.<br/><br/>Mnogi menijo, da celibat povzroča zlorabe. Kot vedno pravim, celibat kot tak ni razlog za zlorabo – kako drugače pojasnimo, da 99,9 odstotka vseh zlorabnikov ne živi v celibatu, in kako pojasnimo, da 95 ali 96 odstotkov vseh duhovnikov ne zlorablja mladoletnikov? Toda celibat ali zaobljuba čistosti, ki ni zares integrirana, ki se v resnici ne živi pravilno – da, to povzroča problem. Včasih ljudje začnejo piti, včasih se lotijo iger na srečo, včasih pa se spolno zlorabljajo, tako z odraslimi kot z mladoletniki.<br/><br/>Pravo vprašanje glede tega je, kako se spopasti s pojmom verske duhovne moči, s katero so vloženi duhovniki in škofje? Kako nam lahko teologija pomaga razumeti, in morda kako nam lahko sociologija, psihologija ali poslovna administracija pomagajo opredeliti meje moči in nujnost ohranjanja svojih meja. |
| I'm not surprised by this mismatch. In fact, I'd even go so far as to say this isn't something that will ever change, nor should we get all steamed up about changing it. In 10 years, we'll still have bleeding edge, complex items in the biggest concerns list, and the things we're finally getting around to understanding will be the major parts of our spending.<br/><br/>Now, Gunnar and Andy both have excellent points, specifically about IT teams seeing IT problems and solving them with IT solutions; in fact, I'm positive their points hold merit.<br/><br/>But I think there are other ideas that trump those (I did comment on their blogs about it, and later decided I should just blog here). Those top 3 concerns are bleedingly new such that:<br/><br/>we fear new things because we don't understand them, or don't understand them because they're new.<br/><br/>they're too new for us to have solid approaches to handling them.<br/><br/>they're too new for us to know if we should be worried or not! we tend to default to paranoid/worried, which is good!<br/><br/>too new to have obvious budget items assigned to them. Can I buy a box or some software that provide "cloud security" or "social media security?"<br/><br/>they're so new the business doesn't even know how to use them or what they want out of them. Let alone how we can secure them while still meeting or at least not stomping all over business needs. If the business doesn't even know how to use them yet, I'm not sure security is in any position to guide that usage securely.<br/><br/>It also should be mentioned that these new things are being largely pushed via consumerland and into the business, with IT as a sort of, "Oh yeah," thought. Firewalls, AV, AM, Auth are all IT responses to typically IT issues. Of course there is a difference there. They're also very subjective issues, as opposed to very objective items like firewalls, known malicious bits, behaviors, signatures, ports. Business presents very complex issues that are often involving people (which we can't patch) and that often don't fit nicely into blanket rules. Even if we turned away from technical solutions and devoted our time into solving these problems, they are still not going to be neatly solved. Likewise, when push comes to shove, can you have and meet goals with firewalls? Can you show improvement? All of this flows from the rather subjective non-technical aspect of those issues. Sort of the difference between a child's report card and the feedback you get from a parent-teacher conference. If you have a child, which one would you be most inclined to disagree with or not necessarily believe? (The answer is the subjective one!)<br/><br/>It could be said this is the natural progression of security and technology: from shoring up the technical controls to moving up the stack towards behavior and people. Sure, these 3 top concerns can be said to punch through firewalls and network segments, but that's the nature of those things (social media "punching" through a firewall is far different than me punching through an SSH connection to bridge my home network; social media is akin to the *way* I use my SSH connection after the hold is already punched because it is needed; i.e. social media is the way port 80 is used.)<br/><br/>Basically, all indications point to not being surprised by this dichotomy. And I don't think this is some further indication that IT/security is doing it wrong, or isn't aligned properly with business, or has a technical dark-server-room background. I'm not saying we're doing things right or we're properly aligned, but the above isn't a good argument to support the theory of those deficiencies.<br/><br/>Now for a really big jump. I'd liken the current increase in mobile computing to be as big as the introduction of computers into the business and later the PC/internet into business. Now, I wasn't around when the former happened, nor was I in the industry when the personal computer revolution swept into business, but I would bet that is the closest comparison so far. I may even say the same for social media. These are damned new and they're big changes beyond just bringing in Macs or new software or some new business process. | Pravzaprav bi šel celo tako daleč, da bi rekel, da se to ne bo nikoli spremenilo, niti se ne bi smeli vsi vznemirjati zaradi tega. Čez 10 let bomo še vedno imeli krvavo rob, zapletene točke na seznamu največjih skrbi, in stvari, ki jih bomo končno prišli do razumevanja, bodo glavni deli naše porabe.<br/><br/>Zdaj imata Gunnar in Andy odlične točke, zlasti o IT ekipah, ki vidijo IT težave in jih rešujejo z IT rešitvami; v resnici sem prepričan, da imajo njihove točke zasluge.<br/><br/>Ampak mislim, da obstajajo tudi druge ideje, ki trump tiste (sem komentiral na svojih blogih o tem, in kasneje se je odločil, da bi moral samo blog tukaj). Ti top 3 skrbi so krvavo nove, tako da:<br/><br/>Bojimo se novih stvari, ker jih ne razumemo, ali pa jih ne razumemo, ker so nove.<br/><br/>Preveč so novi za nas, da bi imeli trdne pristope k ravnanju z njimi.<br/><br/>so preveč novi, da bi vedeli, če bi nas moralo skrbeti ali ne! smo ponavadi privzeto paranoidni / zaskrbljeni, kar je dobro!<br/><br/>preveč nov, da bi imeli očitne proračunske postavke, ki so jim dodeljene. Ali lahko kupim škatlo ali kakšno programsko opremo, ki zagotavlja "varnost v oblaku" ali "varnost socialnih medijev"?<br/><br/>so tako novi, da jih podjetje niti ne ve, kako uporabiti ali kaj hočejo od njih. Kaj šele, kako jih lahko zagotovimo, medtem ko še vedno izpolnjujemo ali vsaj ne zamašimo vseh poslovnih potreb. Če podjetje še ne ve, kako jih uporabljati, nisem prepričan, da je varnost v položaju, da varno vodi to uporabo.<br/><br/>Prav tako je treba omeniti, da se te nove stvari v veliki meri potiskajo skozi potrošniško državo in v posel, z IT kot nekakšno misel, "Oh ja", požarni zidovi, AV, AM, Auth so vsi IT odzivi na tipične IT težave. Seveda obstaja razlika. To so tudi zelo subjektivna vprašanja, v nasprotju z zelo objektivnimi elementi, kot so požarni zidovi, znani zlonamerni bitovi, vedenje, podpisi, vrata. Poslovanje predstavlja zelo zapletena vprašanja, ki pogosto vključujejo ljudi (ki jih ne moremo popraviti) in ki se pogosto ne ujemajo lepo v splošnih pravilih. Tudi če smo se obrnili stran od tehničnih rešitev in posvetili svoj čas reševanju teh problemov, še vedno ne bodo lepo rešeni. Podobno, ko pride do potiskanja, lahko imate in dosežete cilje s požarnimi zidovi? Ali lahko pokažete izboljšanje? Vse to izhaja iz precej subjektivnega netehničnega vidika teh vprašanj. Določite razliko med otrokovo kartico poročila in povratnimi informacijami, ki jih dobite od konference staršev in učiteljev. Če imate otroka, s katerim bi se najverjetneje strinjali ali ne? (Odgovor je subjektiven!)<br/><br/>Lahko bi rekli, da je to naravni napredek varnosti in tehnologije: od podpore tehničnega nadzora do premikanja navzgor v smeri vedenja in ljudi. Seveda lahko rečemo, da ti 3 glavni pomisleki prebijajo skozi požarne zidove in omrežne segmente, vendar je to narava teh stvari (družbeni mediji "prebijajo" skozi požarni zid je daleč drugačen od mene, ki prebijam skozi SSH povezavo za premostitev mojega domačega omrežja; socialni mediji so podobni * načinu * Uporabljam povezavo SSH, ko je zadržanje že preluknje, ker je potrebno; t.<br/><br/>V bistvu vsi znaki kažejo, da me ta dihotomija ne preseneča. In mislim, da to ni še en znak, da IT / varnost dela narobe, ali ni pravilno usklajena s poslovanjem ali ima tehnično ozadje temne sobe strežnika. Ne pravim, da delamo stvari prav ali da smo pravilno poravnani, vendar zgoraj navedeno ni dober argument za podporo teoriji teh pomanjkljivosti.<br/><br/>Zdaj za res velik skok. Rad bi, da je sedanje povečanje mobilnega računalništva tako veliko kot uvedba računalnikov v poslovanje in kasneje računalnikov / interneta v poslovanje. Nisem bil v bližini, ko se je zgodilo prvo, niti nisem bil v industriji, ko je revolucija osebnih računalnikov zajela posel, vendar bi stavil, da je to najbližja primerjava doslej. Lahko celo rečem enako za družbene medije. To so prekleto novi in so velike spremembe poleg tega, da bi prinesli Mace ali novo programsko opremo ali kakšen nov poslovni proces. |
