| Bacopa<br/><br/>19 Nov 2015<br/>Posted by Doxiderol<br/><br/>Bacopa is a perennial plant that thrives in marshy subtropical and tropical regions around the globe. The highly regarded herb is a key ingredient in Doxiderol, a nutritional supplement that enhances cognitive function. Bacopa was chosen for its ability to protect the brain and increase acetylcholine, a biochemical messenger that enables the nervous system to relay information.<br/><br/>Ayurvedic practitioners first described the therapeutic properties of bacopa in 300 BC. The physicians recorded bacopa's abilities to enhance intelligence and memory. Nearly 2,500 years later, a growing body of modern research confirms the cognitive benefits of bacopa recorded in the Ayurvedic text.<br/><br/>In 1987, researchers in India evaluated the effects of bacopa on the intellectual function of school-aged children. During the four-week study, they administered bacopa to 40 children who were 6 to 8 years old. The scientists determined that bacopa increased perception and memory. The children were able to solve maze exercises quicker and more accurately after receiving bacopa. Many parents in India routinely use bacopa to enhance their children's intellectual development.<br/><br/>A 12-week study published in the August 2001 issue of Psychopharmacology investigated the effects of bacopa on cognitive function. Scientists randomly assigned the healthy volunteers, aged 18 to 65, to receive bacopa or an inactive substance. They also used a double-blind configuration for the study to conceal the identities of the products. Researchers use this design to ensure that the test results are valid because it eliminates bias by the researchers and participants. The bacopa group experienced a significant improvement in the speed at which they were able to process visual information. The participants also learned faster and stored new memories more efficiently.<br/><br/>In 2007, a Texas A&M College of Medicine laboratory study revealed one of the mechanisms responsible for bacopa's ability to promote brain health. According to the scientists, bacopa uses polyphenols to prevent oxidative stress and the damage that it causes to healthy brain cells. Bacopa also reduces harmful deposits of a substance known as beta-amyloid, which is the primary component of the plaque in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease.<br/><br/>A double-blind study published in the July 2008 issue of the Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine evaluated the effect of bacopa on elderly patients. The study confirmed that bacopa increased cognitive performance while reducing stress. According to the authors, the benefits achieved in this study confirmed the results of earlier research.<br/><br/>A 90-day study published in the December 2008 issue of Phytotherapy Research confirms the cognitive benefits that were previously demonstrated in other bacopa studies. Bacopa significantly improved the ability of the participants to temporarily store and use information required for completing a complex task. The double-blind study also demonstrated that bacopa reduced the time required to process visual information.<br/><br/>In addition to enhancing nerve signal transmission, the scientists theorize that bacopa increases cognitive function by reducing anxiety. Numerous studies indicate that anxiety interferes with the ability to perform tasks that require higher-level cognitive functions, such as learning and memorization. Stress disrupts biochemical messengers and healthy nerve signal transmission. Bacopa alleviates stress and restores a sense of calm by increasing acetylcholine levels, which reduces your heart rate and enables you to take deeper breaths.<br/><br/>Doxiderol is a great way to obtain the benefits of bacopa. This holistic supplement also contains other natural ingredients that promote brain health and support your ability to focus and concentrate on complex task as well as memorize information. | Bacopa<br/><br/>19 Nov 2015<br/>Založnik: Doxiderol<br/><br/>Bacopa je trajnica, ki uspeva v močvirnih subtropskih in tropskih regijah po vsem svetu. Zelo cenjena zelišča so ključna sestavina v Doxiderolu, prehranskem dodatku, ki izboljša kognitivne funkcije. Zdravilo Bacopa je bilo izbrano zaradi njegove sposobnosti, da zaščiti možgane in poveča acetilholin, biokemični sel, ki omogoča živčnemu sistemu, da prenaša informacije.<br/><br/>Ayurvedski zdravniki so prvič opisali terapevtske lastnosti bakope leta 300 pred našim štetjem. Zdravniki so zabeležili Bacopine sposobnosti za izboljšanje inteligence in spomina. Skoraj 2500 let kasneje naraščajoče telo sodobnih raziskav potrjuje kognitivne koristi bakope, zabeležene v ajurvedskem besedilu.<br/><br/>Leta 1987 so raziskovalci v Indiji ocenili učinke bakope na intelektualno funkcijo otrok v šoli. Med štiritedensko študijo so dali bakopo 40 otrokom, ki so bili stari od 6 do 8 let. Znanstveniki so ugotovili, da je bacopa povečala zaznavanje in spomin. Otroci so lahko hitreje in natančneje rešili labirintne vaje po prejemu bacope. Mnogi starši v Indiji rutinsko uporabljajo bacopo za izboljšanje intelektualnega razvoja svojih otrok.<br/><br/>12-tedenska študija, objavljena v številki Psychopharmacology avgusta 2001, je raziskala učinke bakope na kognitivne funkcije. Znanstveniki so naključno dodelili zdrave prostovoljce, stare od 18 do 65 let, da bi prejeli bakopo ali neaktivno snov. Uporabili so tudi dvojno slepo konfiguracijo za študijo, da bi prikrili identitete izdelkov. Raziskovalci uporabljajo to zasnovo, da zagotovijo, da so rezultati testov veljavni, ker odpravlja pristranskost raziskovalcev in udeležencev. Skupina Bacopa je občutno izboljšala hitrost, s katero so lahko obdelovali vizualne informacije. Udeleženci so se tudi hitreje učili in učinkoviteje shranjevali nove spomine.<br/><br/>Leta 2007 je laboratorijska študija Texas A & M College of Medicine razkrila enega od mehanizmov, ki so odgovorni za sposobnost Bacope za spodbujanje zdravja možganov. Po mnenju znanstvenikov Bacopa uporablja polifenole za preprečevanje oksidativnega stresa in škode, ki jo povzroča zdravim možganskim celicam. Zdravilo Bacopa prav tako zmanjša škodljive usedline snovi, znane kot beta-amiloid, ki je glavna sestavina plaka v možganih bolnikov z Alzheimerjevo boleznijo.<br/><br/>Dvojno slepa študija, objavljena v julijski številki revije Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine leta 2008, je ovrednotila učinek bakope na starejše bolnike. Študija je potrdila, da je bakopa povečala kognitivno zmogljivost, hkrati pa zmanjšala stres. Po mnenju avtorjev so koristi, dosežene v tej študiji, potrdile rezultate prejšnjih raziskav.<br/><br/>90-dnevna študija, objavljena v izdaji Phytotherapy Research decembra 2008, potrjuje kognitivne koristi, ki so bile predhodno dokazane v drugih študijah Bacopa. Bacopa je bistveno izboljšala sposobnost udeležencev, da začasno shranjujejo in uporabljajo informacije, potrebne za dokončanje zapletene naloge. Dvojno slepa študija je pokazala tudi, da je bacopa skrajšala čas, potreben za obdelavo vizualnih informacij.<br/><br/>Poleg izboljšanja prenosa živčnih signalov, znanstveniki teoretizirajo, da bacopa povečuje kognitivne funkcije z zmanjšanjem anksioznosti. Številne študije kažejo, da anksioznost ovira sposobnost opravljanja nalog, ki zahtevajo kognitivne funkcije na višji ravni, kot sta učenje in pomnjenje. Stres moti biokemične glasnike in zdrav prenos živčnih signalov. Bacopa lajša stres in obnavlja občutek miru s povečanjem ravni acetilholina, kar zmanjšuje srčni utrip in vam omogoča globlje dihanje.<br/><br/>Doxiderol je odličen način za pridobitev prednosti bacopa. Ta celostni dodatek vsebuje tudi druge naravne sestavine, ki spodbujajo zdravje možganov in podpirajo vašo sposobnost, da se osredotočite in se osredotočite na zapleteno nalogo, pa tudi na pomnjenje informacij. |

She can also sense demonic auras as well as evil auras. When she was born and growing, however, her powers were sealed and she was much less powerful. Since the defeat of the one sealing her powers, Kagome has reached her full potential.<br/><br/>PURIFICATION By making a physical connection, Kagome has the ability to purify both poison and darkness from a subject (living and inanimate). To do so, she projects her spiritual powers through her hand.<br/><br/>SPIRITUAL BARRIERS With her full potential, Kagome has the ability to create a barrier around herself and expand it around others. It is a dome-shaped barrier that can destroy weak demons that make contact with the barrier.<br/><br/>IMPROVED EYESIGHT<br/>Kagome has the ability to see things that are often invisible to the human eye: ghosts, spirits, divine and evil auras.<br/><br/>ABILITIES WITH WEAPONS<br/>Kagome has the ability to use a bow and arrow. She has been self trained, and after years of practice, her arrow rarely misses its mark. Alongside this, Kagome has the ability to infuse her arrows with powers. She can infuse an arrows with her spiritual powers which allows them to penetrate demonic forces, destroy spells, and purify objects. She can infuse her bow with her powers and deflect enemy attacks. She has the ability to infuse her arrows with purifying energy to purify poison as well as powerful, long distant demonic attacks. And, finally, she has the ability to bypass others with her arrow: If her target happens to be behind a barrier or a hostage, the arrow can teleport and hit only her target<br/><br/>The rest of her abilities have become rather unimportant as they are related to time travel (through the Bone Eater's Well), the Shikon Jewel, or her previous incarnation.<br/><br/>the canon<br/><br/>Kagome has been pulled a few days after her high school graduation, however, before the Bone Eater's Well has opened again to allow her to return to the past permanently.<br/><br/>freestyle<br/><br/>memories<br/><br/>かごめ<br/><br/>The sound of her name was a soft whisper in the back of her mind, like a call muffled by the wind. It was the sound of a distant memory, a voice that she had started to forget but desperately clung to all the same. It was her mother's voice, twisted in the sorrow of her lost daughter. Afterall, Kagome banished without a trace. She vividly remembered those moments, the way the day had begun, what she had for breakfast and the last thing she had said to her mother. It was haunting, those memories, because it was like any other time she had slipped between worlds. She had woken, listless, because she had no purpose outside of school. She could find a job, and was scheduled for an interview that day. Her heart hadn't been in it, but it was what she needed to do.<br/><br/>She remembered the feeling of dread, sucking it up and giving herself a pep talk that she could do this. That she could progress in the life that she was meant to now that things had been settled in the past. Of course, she had the lingering feeling that she no longer belonged in her own time or her own life. Not with everything that she had left behind.<br/><br/>Kagome remembered the feeling of the wood beneath her fingers, the way her hand had curled into the handle to slide the door open. She remembered that she paused, turning to her mother with a bright and vibrant smile as she shook herself from her stupor. "I'm taking off." She remembered how strong her voice sounded, the smile on her mother's lips as her eyes shone with pride. Her mother bade her farewell, which didn't seem any different than before but somehow the weight of the words settled in heavier on Kagome's shoulders the more she reflected.<br/><br/>Briefly, the thoughts flickered forward, wondering if her mother worried over her, missed her like she did. Kagome could openly admit that her mother's strength, her support for the fact that her daughter slipped through time so frequently. There were times when she thought herself weak for not having the woman to lean on.<br/><br/>However, she remembered that she did muster up a meager amount of strength.She could remember the shift in the air, the temperature notably different than what she had expected, blinking at the sudden and unfamiliar surroundings. It was not her family's shrine. And when she turned to go back, to slip through the door she had come through, she was met with unfamiliar and cold metal beneath her fingertips and an interior that was not the entrance of her house. A man stood before her, behind a counter, who stared at her with eyes as wide as her own.<br/><br/>She didn't panic, at least. Being torn through time and placed in impossible situations at least built your willpower as far as strange happenings went. Because it wasn't every day that someone found themselves dragged into the past by a demon, intent on ripping a powerful jewel from their body that they didn't even know was there. And then there was the fact that she had shattered said powerful jewel into who knows how many pieces and was tasked on finding them. Such things were not normal, and she had needed to square up and roll with it once she realized that was her reality. It had seemed so simple, just gather the shards and fix the jewel.<br/><br/>But it hadn't been easy, there were many demons after the shards and the jewel itself. And one particularly powerful demon with a wish that he was determined to see fulfilled. To this day, she had never learned his wish but knew it had never been granted even once he had the blasted thing completed. He had ruined so many lives for the sake of nothing. Ruined so many lives for such a futile task. Naraku had been the most difficult foe, and the one who had been the center of everything that had gone wrong in all of her friend's lives.<br/><br/>But, it was that unpredicability, that necessity to roll with what was happening and the willpower that she had gained from her adventure that she remembered drawing upon to come up with a story that fit in the moment that didn't seem too whimsical or far fetched. She needed to be believed, she needed to survive.<br/><br/>Afterall, she faced worse than a man in a camera store. She had lied through her teeth to save her life before.<br/><br/>"I was looking for a job." In the end, it wasn't a complete lie. After all, she had set out of her house with the intent of attending a job interview. Her state of dress would at least attest to that much. It was one of the easier fibs she had ever told.<br/><br/>And, for some reason, that crazy man hired her.<br/><br/>かごめ<br/><br/>Kagomed rolled over in her bed as she pushed back the distant memories, refusing to acknowledge that she was really awake. She clawed at the last glimpses of sleep, begging it to return and to take her back into its embrace. She closed her eyes, willing sleep to come and was only met with memories. The echoes of a song sang in the distance of her memories, a song that had often tormented her, given the same name as her. The voice that sang was no longer reminiscent of her mother, but the voices of children who she had often played with growing up. They called back the memories, even though it had been years since she started this live, even though she was happy in this life, the call of these memories was too loud.<br/><br/>Suddenly, she was falling back into them and sleep evaded her again. She was watching herself in her family's embrace while Inuyasha was pulled back into the well, looking as startled as she had felt. The memories of that moment, those feelings, were still so strong. The feeling of heartbreak and sorrow welled up again though it had been so long since she had felt like she had been ripped away from everything that mattered to her.<br/><br/>Of course her family mattered, and she was happy to be in their arms again. She could never fully, truly describe how she had felt in those days. She still couldn't explain the way she felt split in two, with warring desires to be in both her past and present. She remembered the futile attempts to jump through the well, fingers clawing at the ground in a desperate plea to let her return. The first month home, she didn't sleep so much as she cried.<br/><br/>Elysion had garnished a similar reaction, though it was not so fierce because she didn't know exactly where she had slipped through nor did she know where she could worm her way back. Her explorations were subtle between working her job and trying to settle herself into this life. She had no intentions of staying, no intentions of lingering longer than she needed. And while she didn't try as fiercely as she had when she tried to return to the past, her passion was tenfold because she had no ties to this world. Because she was truly alone… With no hope of anyone to reach her.<br/><br/>In her irrational moments, she thought the Jewel had pulled her back and found a new hell for her to reside in. A new hell that would force her to make a wish, but she remembered very clearly that she had wished it gone forever. That didn't stop her dreams, the times when she woke up in the night sobbing. And those memories of her past were the hardest to deal with, the hardest to forget. Her heart began to race in a panic as she turned in her bed again, her breath became a struggle as she fought against a panic attack induced by her wandering mind this late into the night.<br/><br/>She hated feeling so weak, so afraid.<br/><br/>籠の中の鳥は<br/><br/>Kagome finally pulled herself from bed, her room lit with a pale light that was enough to guide her to the bathroom. She stood before the mirror, the sink running while she stared at her reflection. Raven colored hair covered her face and she felt as bad as she looked. Her first morning in Elysion was similar to this, only she was in worse shape.<br/><br/>She had found a place to sleep, managing to work out a deal with the owner of the building to allow her to stay a small period of time without paying. Perhaps it had been Miroku's influence that allowed her to strike such deals, as the monk was known for his way in charming (or scamming) people into giving them more than enough for the work they had done. The monk had always been that way, since they had first met. He would claim the dwelling of a lord to be haunted when it was not or, claim that they were subject to an attack when they would not be. He would sell his wards and charms for such high prices. It worked practically every time and she wondered why people had been so willing to trust him.<br/><br/>Perhaps it was his smile, or the fact that he was a monk that the people of the past were so willing to crumble. He never preyed on the weak, at least. He always did what was right and he was a symbol of strength to her at times when he would push through everything in order to do what was right. He pushed through the fact that he was dying, that he was cursed, and tried to do something about it rather than wallowing in his fate. He had pushed himself to the limit in the time leading up to their final fight. And she had been glad that they had defeated Naraku before he could become subject to the same fate as his father, and his father before him.<br/><br/>As far as her own charms went, however, she was more fair than her friend and made the deal reasonable. She doubted that anyone in this world would pay a hefty price for an exorcism or banishing demons. They were too technologically advanced for that. But she was clever enough, and smart enough, to make a good deal.<br/><br/>But now, Kagome was in a better place though the look on her face looked the same. Haunted, tired, drained...<br/><br/>A quick glance at a clock on the wall told her that she could try to sleep longer. But she opted out of that, not wanting to face the flashbacks again. She took a shower instead, using the cold water to chase away her demons, to fill her lungs with a sharp intake of breath and force herself awake.<br/><br/>いついつ出やる<br/><br/>It didn't work.<br/><br/>Not in the way she was wanting. The cold water certainly forced the air into her lungs, forced her mind to wake and muscles to seize. A bitter laugh was pulled from her lips as she tilted her head back and found herself remembering more. Today, she wasn't going to escape them so easily. She wasn't going to recover so simply, to recover just because she willed it.<br/><br/>Sometimes, there's no avoiding the thoughts you wanted to. Even when you were certain that you were past them.<br/><br/>Sango would have been a great help in this situation. The demon slayer was her best friend, she would even go as far as to call her the sister that she never had. An older sister who was wise, always had her side when trouble arose. Particularly boy trouble, when such things were rather trivial but it was fun to have a crush and for her friend to be mad on her behalf when Inuyasha made her sad. After all, it had been often that the half-demon would run to his dead lover's side and break her heart more than once.<br/><br/>But, Sango also inspired her in other ways. After all the woman had faced, she had always been so strong, so sure... Even in the times that she had doubted herself, she always pulled through. She admired that she had the ability to survive after losing her whole family -- the reminder of this often pushed Kagome to survive, because she lost everyone to this world -- and then having her brother become a pawn of Naraku. It wasn't easy, couldn't have been something to that just anyone could face and still go forward with. She still smiled, even with that pain and those reminders... She was often so bright, even in the darker times.<br/><br/>And right now, she wanted to lean into the older woman's side, to take comfort in the fact that she was there and she was supportive. She felt that Sango would somehow pull through this, and offer some words of strength and understanding. It was times like these that made these spells worse, the constant reminder that she was without her family.<br/><br/>"I don't want to be alone." She cried aloud in her solitude, the sound of the shower drowning out the plea.<br/><br/>She wasn't afraid to admit it.<br/><br/>夜明けの晩に<br/><br/>Another hour had slipped by before she had realized it. Her skin was cold from the water and it felt like ice ran through her veins. She hadn't realized she had begun to shiver until her hand reached to turn off the water and end her shower. Kagome didn't seek her own gaze in the mirror again, instead, she wrapped herself in towels and trudged out of the bathroom, up the stairs and into her kitchen. She started on making a light breakfast, idly reading through her notes for the day as the food cooked.<br/><br/>Her career was really taking off these last years. Her photos were featured in many galleries, her name started to frequent many lips for those who were interested in photography.<br/><br/>The job she had asked for on a whim had sparked it all. She had been far more lucky than she had expected to be in this world. Never lucky enough to slip back through the cracks into her own world, but lucky enough to do well. As she turned back to the stove, she remembered the time she had finally given up on returning home. It was about two years into her life here, as she had started to venture into photography as more than just a hobby but something she could make a name for herself with.<br/><br/>That day had been particularly pleasant, the sun was high in the sky and she had found herself taking some photos of the natural scenery. A little boy had hidden in one of the plants, and she had caught a picture of the moment his face had settled into a cheerful, mischievous grin the moment before he had jumped out to startle his prey. It reminded her of Shippou, the little kitsune she had, essentially, adopted. He, too, had been torn from his family when they had first met. His father killed and he was determined to avenge him. While young, he did seem so mature in their first encounters.<br/><br/>Maybe it had been the influence of Inuyasha that allowed the kit to act like a kid again, to be young and whimsical at times while others he was more mature. He offered comfort to her in his own way, and she tried to care for him as she would her own though she had been so young then as well. However, her youth did not stop her from understanding how to tend to him or care for him like her child. Her heart swelled when he smiled, when he had been so happy for his gift of crayons and took the time to make art. She was so proud of each drawing that he had finished that she knew that this was how a mother would feel in such a situation.<br/><br/>The pain that had ripped through her was too much, too sudden. She missed him and wanted to see how much he had grown since she had been gone. She had missed so much...<br/><br/>To spare herself any further pain, any false hopes… She gave up. And focused on bettering herself.<br/><br/>鶴と亀が<br/><br/>Breakfast tasted bland, boring, and inspired. Only after she had finished did she realized she had forgotten to any sort of spices or flavor to the food. It was too late now to remember that much, as her mind was too busy remembering other details of her life that clearly had become more important than her food.<br/><br/>"Sit!"<br/><br/>Of course, nothing happened when she had angrily yelled at one particularly frustrating client that reminded her of the half-demon. He was being particularly stubborn and rude, wanting a photo taken his way rather than letting it work out naturally. You could try to force wild animals to behave how you wanted. But, rarely did anyone succeed with force. Inuyasha wasn't as bad, however. Inuyasha had learned before she had been forced away from him. He had become gentler, more understanding, more mature though there were times he was still childish and cocky.<br/><br/>She remember how red her cheeks had burned, but how she stood her ground and fired him. She told him she refused to work for anyone or with anyone who wanted to twist something beyond it's nature, beyond it's own desires.<br/><br/>She should have compared the man to Naraku rather than Inuyasha. Though her client did not have such extreme intentions. At least the feeling afterwards was a pleasant memory. The freedom of knowing that she had come so far that she could refuse work that she didn't want to do, to be her own person that was independent of others. She could say that she made it at that point. Even though she heard rumors days later with words meant to slander her.<br/><br/>She defended herself righteously, like she did towards the end of her journey. After all, she was the only one who could protect herself in this world.<br/><br/>滑った<br/><br/>Morning light began to creep into her home, reminding her again of the passage of time. Again, she considered the list of things she had to do and debated on where to start. Or, if she should even start at all. With how the day began, she didn't know if she could consider that a great idea. It was doubtful that she would be successful with how lost in herself she was becoming.<br/><br/>She didn't want to mess up her latest work. Because she had done that on a few occasions before. It wasn't pleasant to try and recover from a complete disaster.<br/><br/>Kagome remembered the feeling of her expensive, brand new, camera slipping from her hands. She wasn't prepared to support it, because she had just removed it from her bag. Part of her screamed on the inside. A dramatic, over-the-top, full on scream that she frequently did when she was much, much younger. When she was struggling to make it through middle school while hopping between times. The other part of her had remained frozen in place while her lense completely shattered and the rest of the camera had broken along with it.<br/><br/>Seeing Inuyasha's brother, a full demon, standing before her was the last thing she expected when she had made her way out for her photos. He stood as proud as ever, as tall as ever, as imposing as she remembered. He didn't look fazed at all to be in an entirely different world, though she was never the best at reading his mind. His name on her lips was so potent, that she could remember the tiniest feelings as she did. Her lips were chapped, her mouth felt dry, and the bubbling feeling of anxiety in her stomach made her feel sick.<br/><br/>She didn't want her hopes to be up.<br/><br/>But, she wanted him to be there, even if they were not friends. They were allies, if anything, since they had fought side by side. And something was better than absolutely nothing.<br/><br/>And Kagome had the sense enough not to throw herself at him, to wrap her arms around him in relief that knowing she was not alone. Her camera no longer mattered when she approached him. She remembered that nothing else mattered for days as she spent time with him, not speaking of their world but speaking (or, she was speaking and he simply acknowledged that fact).<br/><br/>When, exactly, she fell for him though… Kagome couldn't recall. It was a subtle thing, just like he was. But she knew the feeling was there. And he let her know that she was not alone in the fact that she had fallen, that feelings had somehow blossomed.<br/><br/>後ろの正面<br/><br/>A feeling of weightlessness overtook her and suddenly her eyes opened while her mind desperately clawed for the last thing she was doing. She didn't recall when she had fallen asleep on her couch, but she knew the last place she had been was on the far too comfortable cushions. She didn't struggle, however, or fight the weightlessness as she was in familiar arms. Her head tilted against Sesshoumaru's chest, taking comfort in the fact that he was here and she wasn't alone.<br/><br/>"Welcome back." His response was a soft hum in acknowledgement. He didn't need to speak much for her to understand his intent, or the rest of what he had to say.<br/><br/>He carried her back to her bed, settled her into it with ease. Her eyes met his and she smiled easily because no more memories drifted back, no more recollections teased at her. No, whenever he was near, she never fell back into those thoughts. He had helped, and the years had helped. Today was just… One of those days.<br/><br/>"Sleep." He commanded with ease, her eyes rolled at him but she did not fight because she was tired. Her hand clung tightly to him, while she felt his opposite hand press to her forehead in assessment of her wellbeing.<br/><br/>"I'm okay," she said, her words firm with her promise.<br/><br/>She was okay. She was alive. And she was happy.<br/><br/>だあれ<br/><br/>shipper<br/><br/>summary<br/><br/>Kagome, at one point in her life, was a rather regular teenage girl until she was attacked by a demon inside her family's well house. The demon dragged her down into the well, which magically transported her about 500 years into the past. There, she learned that a sacred jewel was encased inside her body as she was the reincarnation of a priestess that had died 50 years prior to the time she was dragged into. The jewel was ripped from her body and the demon that dragged her through time was defeated by the half-demon that she freed who was pinned to the tree. Kagome befriended the half-demon, Inuyasha, in time and traveled with him to restore the jewel that she, herself, shattered. Though it was not so straightforward and easy to do as many demons and humans sought the jewel for their own purposes. She befriended a young kitsune demon, a monk, and a demon slayer who all traveled with her to restore the jewel.<br/><br/>Her group, however, was not the one to complete the jewel. Instead, an evil half-demon who manipulated the majority of the major events in most of her companion's lives. When he finally collected all the pieces of the jewel and made his wish on the tainted object, Kagome was drawn into the jewel itself with the intent of her making a selfish wish to keep her trapped inside forever, keeping the jewel alive. It was the stubbornness of Inuyasha that managed to save her from the darkness. In the end, she returned to her natural time, finished high school as was expect from a girl of her timeline. Though days later, Kagome ended up in Elysion. She has been in this world for five years, and has long since given up on returning home. She's settled happily into her new life.<br/><br/>platonic<br/><br/>It's rather easy for Kagome to make new friends, she hasn't changed much from her youth. She is a cheerful young woman who is empathetic and welcoming to most of all in her life. In her youth, she befriended demons when most would fear them. Even demons that used to eat humans, she has befriended and she changed their ways (she'd like to think). This being said, it's really easy to become her friend as long as someone is able to shown that they are willing to be redeemed, or show that they are not completely evil. She feels greatly for everyone she meets, so it's hard for her not to be drawn to others in a desire to be friends.<br/><br/>antagonistic<br/><br/>The only way to earn Kagome's wrath is to be so deplorable, so evil, and so far beyond redemption that she can't see any good in you. And she can see the good in pretty much everyone and everything. Honestly, with whom she has faced? A half-demon that pitted two lovers against each other, that cursed the entire male line of one of her friends, and then had her best friend's brother kill their family… Yeah, I don't see her hating anyone without them really, really working for it. Feel free to give it a shot, though.<br/><br/>romantic<br/><br/>When in love, Kagome is a strong support, always staying there even when things may be rough. However, Kagome is not looking for love, wasn't looking for love when she arrived so any past relationships don't exist. This isn't to say that someone hasn't fallen in love with her. She can definitely be the subject of someone's unrequited love, she'll probably be oblivious about it, though. Finally, Kagome is currently engaged to Sesshoumaru, surprisingly. I'm totally open to potential AU things, though. <3<br/><br/>fandom hell<br/><br/>age ancient<br/><br/>species space queen<br/><br/>occupation dying<br/><br/>prefers she/her<br/><br/>awards<br/><br/>pro<br/>she/her est 62woo i suck at plot replies. but ok anyway!!! neptune is very friendly and has that 'cool' persona, he's really fun to be around, and he's SUPER good to work with. like he's super patient and he'll do anything she asks of him--he's really easy to work with, definitely in comparison to other models. so i love the idea of them being all work oriented friends at first and then turning into something more. neptune definitely tries to surround himself with people, because he loves having friends, and kagome is pretty much his type too? like she's sweet and she's a strong woman, and he is actually better friends with women than he is with men, idk why, he just loves being surrounded by female friends who knows. i love my guys being super good friends and protecting their girl friends honestly. but oh M A N i love pseduo-family type relationships and neptune is an only child, so he hasn't had any like, familial relationships like that. so her looking out for him all big sister like would make him be like ????? cause he's confused but also he actually really likes that LOL! they're both good kids, i think they'd be really fun ^^<br/><br/>fandom fire emblem: fates<br/><br/>age ninteen<br/><br/>species Part human / part dragon<br/><br/>occupation representative guardian<br/><br/>prefers she/her<br/><br/>awards<br/><br/>yonder<br/>she/her aest 20 posts<br/><br/>I haven't seen Inuyasha at all but... from what I've read Kagome seems to be one of those people who might be able to help Corrin out with her emotional state. There's a lot weighing on her mind since she had to fight her birth family against her will and last time she saw them they all pretty much hated her. Frankly she hasn't worked through everything yet since she was essentially at the head of a full-scale war. I feel they could be friends as Corrin is quite open in her personality, extremely trusting as well. She's just... hiding and struggling through a lot.

I love your idea of Kagome taking a pic of Elsa! You know, she's also a singer/performer at a local theater so I can imagine Kagome going there to scope things out and then catching Elsa backstage or something--and then the friendship could blossom from there! I absolutely adore the idea of these two spending quality bff time together doing the small but fun things Elsa never experienced as a child.

Prav tako lahko zaznava demonske avre kot tudi zlobne avre. Ko pa se je rodila in odraščala, so bile njene moči zapečatene in je bila veliko manj močna. Od poraza tistega, ki je zapečatil njene moči, je Kagome dosegla svoj polni potencial.<br/><br/>OČIŠČEVANJE Kagome je s fizično povezavo sposobna očistiti tako strup kot temo subjekta (živega in neživega). Da bi to naredila, projicira svoje duhovne moči skozi svojo roko.<br/><br/>S svojim polnim potencialom ima Kagome sposobnost ustvariti oviro okoli sebe in jo razširiti okoli drugih. To je kupolasta ovira, ki lahko uniči šibke demone, ki pridejo v stik z oviro.<br/><br/>IZBOLJŠANJE OČI<br/>Kagome ima sposobnost videti stvari, ki so pogosto nevidne za človeško oko: duhovi, duhovi, božanske in zlobne avre.<br/><br/>SPOSOBNOSTI Z ORUŽJEM<br/>Kagome ima sposobnost uporabe loka in puščice. Ona je bila samousposobljena, in po letih prakse, njena puščica redko zamudi svojo oznako. Poleg tega, Kagome ima sposobnost, da napolni svoje puščice z močmi. S svojimi duhovnimi močmi lahko napolni puščice, kar jim omogoča, da prodrejo v demonske sile, uničijo uroke in očistijo predmete. Lahko napolni svoj lok s svojimi močmi in odvrne sovražnikove napade. Ima sposobnost, da napolni svoje puščice s čistilno energijo, da očisti strup, kot tudi močne, dolge oddaljene demonske napade. In končno, ona ima sposobnost, da zaobide druge s svojo puščico: Če se zgodi, da je njena tarča za oviro ali talca, lahko puščica teleportira in zadeti samo svojo tarčo.<br/><br/>Preostale njene sposobnosti so postale precej nepomembne, saj so povezane s potovanjem skozi čas (prek vodnjaka za kosti), draguljem Shikon ali njeno prejšnjo inkarnacijo.<br/><br/>kanon<br/><br/>Kagome je bila potegnjena nekaj dni po diplomi iz srednje šole, vendar preden se je ponovno odprl vodnjak, ki ji je omogočil, da se trajno vrne v preteklost.<br/><br/>Prosti slog<br/><br/>spomini<br/><br/>かごめ<br/><br/>Zvok njenega imena je bil mehak šepet v njeni glavi, kot klic, ki ga je utišal veter. To je bil zvok oddaljenega spomina, glas, ki ga je začela pozabljati, vendar se je vseeno obupno držala. To je bil glas njene matere, izkrivljen v žalosti njene izgubljene hčere. Navsezadnje je Kagome izgnala brez sledu. Živo se je spominjala tistih trenutkov, načina, kako se je dan začel, kaj je jedla za zajtrk in zadnjega, kar je rekla mami. Te spomine je preganjalo, ker je bilo kot vsak drugi čas, ko je zdrsnila med svetove. Zbudila se je, brez poguma, ker ni imela smisla izven šole. Lahko je našla službo in je bila ta dan načrtovana za razgovor. Njeno srce ni bilo v njej, toda to je bilo tisto, kar je morala storiti.<br/><br/>Spomnila se je občutka strahu, ki ga je sesala in se pogovarjala, da lahko to stori. Da lahko napreduje v življenju, ki mu je bilo namenjeno zdaj, ko so bile stvari urejene v preteklosti. Seveda je imela dolgotrajen občutek, da ne pripada več svojemu času ali svojemu življenju, ne z vsem, kar je pustila za seboj.<br/><br/>Kagome se je spomnila občutka lesa pod prsti, kako se je njena roka zvila v ročaj, da bi odprla vrata. Spomnila se je, da se je ustavila in se obrnila k mami s svetlim in živahnim nasmehom, ko se je tresla od omamljenosti. "Odhajam." Spomnila se je, kako močan je bil njen glas, nasmeh na ustnicah njene matere, ko so ji oči sijale s ponosom. Njena mati se je poslovila, kar se ni zdelo nič drugače kot prej, toda teža besed se je nekako težje usedla na Kagomejina ramena, bolj ko je razmišljala.<br/><br/>Na kratko so misli utripale naprej, spraševala se je, ali jo je mati skrbela za njo, jo pogrešala tako kot ona. Kagome je lahko odkrito priznala, da je mamina moč, njena podpora dejstvu, da je njena hči tako pogosto zdrsnila skozi čas. Včasih je mislila, da je šibka, ker se ne more nasloniti na žensko.<br/><br/>Spomnila pa se je, da je nabrala malo moči. Spomnila se je premika v zraku, temperature, ki je bila bistveno drugačna od tistega, kar je pričakovala, in utripala na nenadno in neznano okolico. In ko se je obrnila, da bi se vrnila, da bi se zdrsnila skozi vrata, ki jih je prišla skozi, jo je srečala z neznano in hladno kovino pod konicami prstov in notranjostjo, ki ni bila vhod v njeno hišo. Pred njo je stal moški za pultom, ki jo je gledal z očmi, širokimi kot njene.<br/><br/>Raztrgana skozi čas in postavljena v nemogoče situacije, je vsaj zgradila tvojo moč volje, kolikor je šlo do čudnih dogodkov. Ker ni bilo vsak dan, da je nekdo vlekel v preteklost demona, ki je nameraval iztrgati močan dragulj iz svojega telesa, za katerega sploh niso vedeli, da je tam. In potem je bilo dejstvo, da je razbil rekel močan dragulj v kdo ve, koliko kosov in je bila naloga, da jih najdejo. Takšne stvari niso bile normalne, in je morala kvadrat in roll z njim, ko je spoznala, da je njena realnost. Zdelo se je tako preprosto, samo zberite koščke in popravite dragulj.<br/><br/>Toda ni bilo lahko, ker je bilo veliko demonov za drobci in samim draguljem in še posebej močnim demonom z željo, ki jo je bil odločen videti izpolnjeno. Do danes se ni nikoli naučila njegove želje, vendar je vedela, da ji ni bilo nikoli uresničeno, tudi ko je končal to pokvarjeno stvar. Uničil je toliko življenj za nič. Uničil je toliko življenj za tako neuspešno nalogo. Naraku je bil najtežji sovražnik in tisti, ki je bil središče vsega, kar je šlo narobe v življenju njenega prijatelja.<br/><br/>Ampak, to je bila ta nepredvidljivost, ta potreba, da se premikamo s tem, kar se dogaja, in moč volje, ki jo je pridobila iz svoje pustolovščine, da se je spomnila, da je pripravila zgodbo, ki se prilega v trenutku, ki se ni zdela preveč muhasta ali daleč pridobljena. Morala je verjeti, morala je preživeti.<br/><br/>Navsezadnje se je soočila s hujšim stanjem kot moški v trgovini s fotoaparati, saj je že prej lagala skozi zobe, da bi si rešila življenje.<br/><br/>"Iskala sem službo." Na koncu ni bila popolna laž. Konec koncev je odšla iz svoje hiše z namenom, da se udeleži razgovora za službo. Njeno stanje obleke bi vsaj potrdilo, da je toliko. To je bil eden od lažjih fibs je kdaj povedal.<br/><br/>In iz nekega razloga jo je ta norec najel.<br/><br/>かごめ<br/><br/>Kagomed se je prevrnila v postelji, medtem ko je potiskala nazaj oddaljene spomine, noče priznati, da je resnično budna. Na zadnji pogled spanja je zagrabila kremplje in ga prosila, naj se vrne in jo vzame nazaj v objem. Zaprla je oči, pripravljena na spanje, da bi prišla, in srečala se je le s spomini. Odmevi pesmi so peli v daljavi njenih spominov, pesem, ki jo je pogosto mučila, dobila je isto ime kot ona. Glas, ki je pel, ni več spominjal na njeno mater, ampak na glasove otrok, s katerimi se je pogosto igrala, ko je odraščala. Poklicali so spomine, čeprav je minilo več let, odkar je začela živeti, čeprav je bila srečna v tem življenju, je bil klic teh spominov preglasen.<br/><br/>Nenadoma je padla nazaj v njih in spanec ji je spet ušel. Gledala je sebe v objemu svoje družine, medtem ko je bila Inuyasha potegnjena nazaj v vodnjak, videti tako prestrašena, kot se je počutila. Spomini na tisti trenutek, ti občutki, so bili še vedno tako močni. Občutek zlomljenega srca in žalosti je spet izbruhnil, čeprav je bilo tako dolgo, odkar se je počutila, kot da je bila odtrgana od vsega, kar ji je bilo pomembno.<br/><br/>Seveda je bila njena družina pomembna in bila je srečna, da je spet v njihovih rokah. Nikoli ni mogla v celoti, resnično opisati, kako se je takrat počutila. Še vedno ni mogla razložiti, kako se je počutila razdeljeno na dva dela, s konfliktnimi željami, da bi bila v svoji preteklosti in sedanjosti. Spomnila se je neuspešnih poskusov, da bi skočila skozi vodnjak, s prsti na tleh v obupni prošnji, da bi se vrnila. Prvi mesec doma ni spala toliko, kot je jokala.<br/><br/>Elysion je imela podobno reakcijo, čeprav ni bila tako divja, ker ni natančno vedela, kje je zdrsnila, niti ni vedela, kje bi se lahko vrnila. Njena raziskovanja so bila subtilna med delom in poskusom, da bi se ustalila v tem življenju. Ni imela namena ostati, ni imela namena, da bi ostala dlje, kot je potrebovala. Čeprav se ni tako močno trudila, ko se je poskušala vrniti v preteklost, je bila njena strast desetkrat večja, ker ni imela nobenih vezi s tem svetom, ker je bila resnično sama, brez upanja, da jo bo kdo dosegel.<br/><br/>V svojih iracionalnih trenutkih je mislila, da jo je Dragulj potegnil nazaj in našel nov pekel, v katerem bi lahko živela. Novi pekel, ki bi jo prisilil, da si zaželi željo, vendar se je zelo jasno spomnila, da si je želela, da bi za vedno izginila. To ni ustavilo njenih sanj, trenutkov, ko se je zbudila ponoči in jokala, in spomini na njeno preteklost so bili najtežji za spopadanje, najtežji za pozabljanje. Njeno srce je začelo teči v paniki, ko se je spet obrnila v postelji, njen dih je postal boj, ko se je borila proti napadu panike, ki ga je povzročil njen potepuški um tako pozno v noč.<br/><br/>Sovražila je občutek šibkosti, strahu.<br/><br/>籠の中の鳥は<br/><br/>Kagome se je končno potegnila iz postelje, njena soba je osvetljena z bledo lučjo, ki je bila dovolj, da jo je vodila v kopalnico. Stala je pred ogledalom, umivalnik teče, medtem ko je strmela v svoj odsev. Raven barvane lase prekrila obraz in se počutila tako slabo, kot je videti. Njeno prvo jutro v Elysion je bilo podobno temu, le da je bila v slabšem stanju.<br/><br/>Našla je prostor za spanje in uspela skleniti dogovor z lastnikom stavbe, da bi lahko ostala nekaj časa, ne da bi plačala. Morda je bil Mirokujev vpliv tisti, ki ji je omogočil sklepanje takšnih poslov, saj je bil menih znan po svoji poti v očarljivih (ali prevarantskih) ljudeh, da jim je dal več kot dovolj za delo, ki so ga opravili. Menih je bil vedno tak, odkar sta se prvič srečala. Trdil je, da je stanovanje gospoda preganjano, ko ni bilo, ali trdil, da so bili predmet napada, ko ne bi bili. Prodal je svoje oddelke in čare za tako visoke cene. Delovalo je praktično vsakič in spraševala se je, zakaj so mu ljudje tako pripravljeni zaupati.<br/><br/>Morda je bil to njegov nasmeh ali dejstvo, da je bil menih, da so se ljudje v preteklosti tako pripravljeni razpadati. Nikoli ni lovil šibkih, vsaj. Vedno je delal, kar je prav, in bil je simbol moči za njo v trenutkih, ko bi potisnil skozi vse, da bi naredil, kar je prav. Potisnil se je skozi dejstvo, da umira, da je bil preklet, in poskušal nekaj storiti glede tega, namesto da bi se vlekel v svojo usodo. Potisnil se je do meje v času, ki je vodil do njihovega zadnjega boja. In bila je vesela, da so premagali Narakuja, preden je lahko postal predmet iste usode kot njegov oče in njegov oče pred njim.<br/><br/>Kar se tiče njenega lastnega šarma, pa je bila bolj poštena kot njena prijateljica in je posel razumen. Dvomila je, da bi kdorkoli na tem svetu plačal visoko ceno za izganjanje hudiča ali izganjanje demonov. Bili so preveč tehnološko napredni za to. Toda bila je dovolj pametna in dovolj pametna, da je sklenila dober posel.<br/><br/>Toda zdaj je bila Kagome na boljšem kraju, čeprav je bil njen obraz videti enako.<br/><br/>Hiter pogled na uro na steni ji je povedal, da bi lahko poskusila spati dlje. Vendar se je odločila, da ne bo več želela soočiti s spomini. Namesto tega se je oprhala, s hladno vodo je pregnala svoje demone, napolnila pljuča z ostrim vdihom in se prisilila, da se je zbudila.<br/><br/>いついつ出やる<br/><br/>Ni delovalo.<br/><br/>Ne tako, kot je želela. Hladna voda je zagotovo prisilila zrak v pljuča, prisilila um, da se zbudi, in mišice, da se zgrabijo. Grenki smeh je bil potegnjen iz ustnic, ko je nagnila glavo nazaj in se spomnila več. Danes se jim ni hotela tako zlahka izogniti, da bi si opomogla samo zato, ker je tako želela.<br/><br/>Včasih se ne moreš izogniti misli, ki si si jih želel, tudi ko si bil prepričan, da si jih prebolel.<br/><br/>Sango bi bila velika pomoč v tej situaciji. Demon Slayer je bila njena najboljša prijateljica, bi celo šel tako daleč, da bi jo poklical sestra, ki je nikoli ni imela. Starejša sestra, ki je bila modra, vedno je imela svojo stran, ko so se pojavile težave. Zlasti fant težave, ko so bile takšne stvari precej trivialno, vendar je bilo zabavno, da imajo simpatijo in za svojo prijateljico, da je jezen v njenem imenu, ko Inuyasha jo je žalostno. Navsezadnje je bilo pogosto, da je napol demon tekel na stran svojega mrtvega ljubimca in ji več kot enkrat zlomil srce.<br/><br/>Toda Sango jo je navdihnil tudi na druge načine. Po vsem, s čimer se je soočila, je bila vedno tako močna, tako prepričana... Tudi v časih, ko je dvomila v sebe, je vedno uspevala. Občudovala je, da je imela sposobnost preživeti po izgubi celotne družine - spomin na to je pogosto potiskal Kagome, da preživi, ker je izgubila vse na tem svetu - in potem je njen brat postal pion Narakuja. Ni bilo lahko, ni moglo biti nekaj, s čimer bi se lahko kdo soočil in šel naprej. Še vedno se je smehljala, kljub bolečini in spominom... Pogosto je bila tako svetla, tudi v temnejših časih.<br/><br/>In prav zdaj se je želela nasloniti na stran starejše ženske, da bi se potolažila v dejstvu, da je bila tam in da je podpirala. Čutila je, da bo Sango nekako potegnil skozi to in ponudil nekaj besed moči in razumevanja. Takšni časi so poslabšali te uroke, stalni opomnik, da je bila brez družine.<br/><br/>"Nočem biti sama." Zakričala je glasno v svoji osamljenosti, zvok prhe utapljanje prošnjo.<br/><br/>Ni se bala priznati.<br/><br/>夜明けの晩に<br/><br/>Še eno uro je minilo, preden se je tega zavedala. Koža ji je bila hladna iz vode in čutila je, da ji led teče po žilah. Ni se zavedala, da se je začela tresti, dokler ni dosegla roke, da bi ugasnila vodo in končala svoj tuš. Kagome ni več iskala svojega pogleda v ogledalo, namesto tega se je zavila v brisače in izšla iz kopalnice, se povzpela po stopnicah in odšla v kuhinjo. Začela je z izdelavo lahek zajtrk, brezbrižno branje skozi njene zapiske za dan, kot je kuhana hrana.<br/><br/>Njena kariera se je v zadnjih letih res začela. Njene fotografije so bile predstavljene v številnih galerijah, njeno ime pa je začelo pogosto uporabljati veliko ustnic za tiste, ki so se zanimali za fotografijo.<br/><br/>Zaposlitev, ki jo je prosila na muhavost je sprožila vse to. Imela je veliko več sreče, kot je pričakovala, da bo na tem svetu. Nikoli ni imela sreče, da bi se vrnila skozi razpoke v svoj svet, vendar dovolj srečna, da bi naredila dobro. Ko se je obrnila nazaj k peči, se je spomnila časa, ko se je končno odrekla vrnitvi domov. To je bilo približno dve leti v njenem življenju tukaj, saj se je začela ukvarjati s fotografijo kot več kot le hobi, ampak nekaj, s čimer si je lahko ustvarila ime.<br/><br/>Tisti dan je bil še posebej prijeten, sonce je bilo visoko na nebu in našla se je pri fotografiranju naravne pokrajine. Majhen deček se je skril v eno od rastlin in ujela je sliko trenutka, ko se je njegov obraz ustalil v veselem, zlobnem nasmehu v trenutku, preden je skočil ven, da bi prestrašil svoj plen. Spomnil jo je na Shippouja, ki ga je v bistvu posvojila. Tudi on je bil odtrgan od svoje družine, ko sta se prvič srečala. Njegov oče je ubil in odločen je bil, da ga maščuje. Ko je bil mlad, se je zdelo, da je tako zrel v svojih prvih srečanjih.<br/><br/>Morda je bil vpliv Inuyasha, ki je omogočil, da se je kit spet obnašal kot otrok, da je bil mlad in muhast občasno, medtem ko so bili drugi bolj zreli. Ponudil ji je tolažbo na svoj način, in ona je skušala skrbeti zanj, kot bi bila njena lastna, čeprav je bila takrat tako mlada. Vendar ji mladost ni preprečila, da bi razumela, kako skrbeti zanj ali skrbeti za njega kot njen otrok. Njeno srce je nabreknilo, ko se je nasmehnil, ko je bil tako srečen zaradi darila svinčnikov in si vzel čas za umetnost. Bila je tako ponosna na vsako risbo, ki jo je končal, da je vedela, kako se bo mati počutila v takšni situaciji.<br/><br/>Bolečina, ki jo je raztrgala, je bila preveč, preveč nenadna. Pogrešala ga je in želela je videti, koliko je zrasel, odkar je odšla. Toliko je zamudila ...<br/><br/>Da bi si prizanesla bolečini, lažnim upanjem, se je odrekla in se osredotočila na to, da bi se izboljšala.<br/><br/>鶴と亀が<br/><br/>Zajtrk je bil mehak, dolgočasen in navdihujoč. Šele ko je končala, je spoznala, da je pozabila na vse začimbe ali okus hrane. Zdaj je bilo prepozno, da bi se spomnila toliko, saj je bil njen um preveč zaposlen s spominjanjem drugih podrobnosti njenega življenja, ki so očitno postale pomembnejše od njene hrane.<br/><br/>"Sedi!"<br/><br/>Seveda se ni zgodilo nič, ko je jezno kričala na eno posebej frustrirajočo stranko, ki jo je spominjala na pol-demona. Bil je še posebej trmast in nesramen, hotel je, da se slika, namesto da bi pustil, da bi se to izšlo naravno. Lahko bi poskušali prisiliti divje živali, da se obnašajo, kot želite. Ampak, redko kdo uspe s silo. Inuyasha ni bila tako slaba, vendar. Inuyasha se je naučil, preden je bila prisiljena stran od njega. Postal je blažji, bolj razumevajoč, bolj zrel, čeprav so bili časi, ko je bil še vedno otročji in domišljav.<br/><br/>Spomnila se je, kako so ji rdeča lica zažgala, kako pa je stala na tleh in ga odpustila. Rekla mu je, da noče delati za nikogar ali z nikomer, ki bi rad zvil nekaj izven narave, izven lastnih želja.<br/><br/>Morala bi ga primerjati z Narakujem in ne z Inuyasho, čeprav njena stranka ni imela tako skrajnih namenov. Svoboda, da ve, da je prišla tako daleč, da je lahko zavrnila delo, ki ga ni želela narediti, da bi bila njena lastna oseba, ki je bila neodvisna od drugih. Lahko bi rekla, da je to storila na tej točki. Kljub temu, da je nekaj dni kasneje slišala govorice z besedami, ki so jo obrekovale.<br/><br/>Branila se je pravično, kot se je branila proti koncu svojega potovanja, saj je bila edina, ki se je lahko branila na tem svetu.<br/><br/>滑った<br/><br/>Jutranja svetloba se je začela plaziti v njen dom, spet jo je opomnila na preteklost časa. Spet je pretehtala seznam stvari, ki jih je morala storiti, in razpravljala o tem, kje začeti. Ali, če bi sploh začela. S tem, kako se je dan začel, ni vedela, ali bi lahko menila, da je to odlična ideja. Bilo je dvomljivo, da bi bila uspešna s tem, kako izgubljena v sebi je postala.<br/><br/>Ni hotela pokvariti svojega zadnjega dela, ker je to že nekajkrat storila, zato ni bilo prijetno, da bi si opomogla od popolne katastrofe.<br/><br/>Kagome se je spominjala občutka, ko ji je dragega, povsem novega fotoaparata zdrsnil iz rok. Ni bila pripravljena, da bi ga podprla, ker ga je pravkar vzela iz torbe. Del njenega je kričal na notranji strani. Dramatična, over-the-top, polna na krik, ki je pogosto naredila, ko je bila veliko, veliko mlajši. Ko se je boril, da bi skozi srednjo šolo, medtem ko skakanje med časi. Drugi del nje je ostal zamrznjen na mestu, medtem ko se je njena leča popolnoma razbila, preostali del kamere pa se je pokvaril skupaj z njo.<br/><br/>Videti Inuyashinega brata, polnega demona, ki je stal pred njo, je bila zadnja stvar, ki jo je pričakovala, ko se je odpravila ven za svoje fotografije. Stal je ponosen kot vedno, visok kot kdajkoli, impozanten, kot se je spomnila. Ni se mu zdelo, da bi bil v povsem drugem svetu, čeprav mu nikoli ni bila najboljša pri branju misli. Njegovo ime na njenih ustnicah je bilo tako močno, da se je spominjala najmanjših občutkov, kot jih je. Njene ustnice so bile razpokane, njena usta so se počutila suha, in občutek tesnobe v trebuhu je povzročil, da se je počutila slabo.<br/><br/>Ni želela, da bi se njeni upi dvignili.<br/><br/>Želela je, da bi bil tam, čeprav nista bila prijatelja, bila sta zaveznika, ker sta se borila drug ob drugem, in nekaj je bilo boljše kot nič.<br/><br/>In Kagome je imela dovolj pameti, da se ni vrgla k njemu, da mu je z olajšanjem objela roke, da ve, da ni sama. Njen fotoaparat ni bil več pomemben, ko se mu je približala. Spomnila se je, da ni nič drugega pomembno za dneve, ko je preživela čas z njim, ne govori o njihovem svetu, ampak govori (ali je govorila in je preprosto priznal to dejstvo).<br/><br/>Ko se je zaljubila vanj, se Kagome ni mogla spomniti. Bila je subtilna stvar, tako kot je bil on. Toda vedela je, da je občutek tam. In ji je dal vedeti, da ni bila sama v dejstvu, da je padla, da so čustva nekako cvetela.<br/><br/>後ろの正面<br/><br/>Občutek breztežnosti jo je prehitel in nenadoma so se ji odprle oči, medtem ko se je njen um obupno zavzemal za zadnjo stvar, ki jo je počela. Ni se spomnila, kdaj je zaspala na svojem kavču, vendar je vedela, da je nazadnje, kjer je bila, na preveč udobnih blazinah. Vendar se ni borila ali se borila z breztežnostjo, kot je bila v znanih rokah. Njena glava se je nagnila proti Sesshoumarujevim prsim in se potolažila v dejstvu, da je bil on tukaj, ona pa ni bila sama.<br/><br/>"Dobrodošla nazaj." Njegov odgovor je bil mehko brenčanje v priznanje. Ni mu bilo treba veliko govoriti, da bi jo razumeli njegov namen, ali ostalo, kar je imel za povedati.<br/><br/>Odnesel jo je nazaj v posteljo, jo namestil v njej z lahkoto. Njene oči so se srečale z njegovim in se je zlahka nasmehnila, ker ni bilo več spominov, ki so se odmikali nazaj, ni bilo več spominov, ki so se ji dražili. Ne, ko je bil blizu, ni nikoli padla nazaj v te misli. Pomagal je, leta so pomagala, danes pa je bil eden tistih dni.<br/><br/>"Spanje." On je ukazal z lahkoto, njene oči zvalil na njem, vendar se ni borila, ker je bila utrujena. Njena roka oprijela tesno na njem, medtem ko je čutil nasprotno roko pritiska na čelo v oceni njenega počutja.<br/><br/>"V redu sem," je rekla, njene besede trdno s svojo obljubo.<br/><br/>Bila je v redu, živa in srečna.<br/><br/>だあれ<br/><br/>pošiljatelj<br/><br/>povzetek<br/><br/>Kagome, na neki točki svojega življenja, je bila precej redna najstnica, dokler je ni napadel demon v hiši njene družine. Demon jo je zvlekel v vodnjak, ki jo je magično prepeljal okoli 500 let v preteklost. Tam je izvedela, da je sveti dragulj zaprt v njenem telesu, saj je bila reinkarnacija duhovnice, ki je umrla 50 let pred časom, ko je bila vlečena. Dragulj je bil iztrgan iz njenega telesa in demon, ki jo je vlekel skozi čas, je premagal pol-demon, ki ga je osvobodila, ki je bil priklenjen na drevo. Kagome se je spoprijateljila s pol-demonom, Inuyasho, v času in potovala z njim, da bi obnovila dragulj, ki ga je sama razbila. Čeprav to ni bilo tako enostavno in enostavno narediti, saj so mnogi demoni in ljudje iskali dragulj za svoje namene. Spoprijateljila se je z mladim demonom kitsune, menihom in izganjalcem demonov, ki so vsi potovali z njo, da bi obnovili dragulj.<br/><br/>Njena skupina pa ni bila tista, ki je dokončala dragulj, temveč zlobni poldemon, ki je manipuliral večino glavnih dogodkov v večini življenj svojega spremljevalca. Ko je končno zbral vse kose dragulja in si zaželel na okuženem predmetu, je bil Kagome vlečen v sam dragulj z namenom, da bi ji naredila sebično željo, da bi jo za vedno obdržala ujetega v notranjosti in ohranila dragulj živo. Trmastost Inuyashe jo je uspela rešiti iz teme. Na koncu se je vrnila v svoj naravni čas, končala srednjo šolo, kot je bilo pričakovano od dekleta njene časovnice. Čeprav je nekaj dni kasneje Kagome končala v Elysionu. Na tem svetu je že pet let in je že dolgo obupala nad vrnitvijo domov.<br/><br/>platonsko<br/><br/>Za Kagome je precej enostavno sklepati nove prijatelje, od svoje mladosti se ni veliko spremenila. Je vesela mlada ženska, ki je najbolj empatična in vabljiva v življenju. V mladosti se je spoprijateljila z demoni, ko bi se jih večina bala. Celo demoni, ki so jedli ljudi, so se spoprijateljili in spremenili svoje načine (raje bi razmišljala). To je dejal, da je res enostavno, da postane njen prijatelj, dokler je nekdo sposoben pokazati, da so pripravljeni, da se odkupi, ali pokazati, da niso popolnoma zlo. Zelo čuti do vseh, ki jih sreča, zato ji je težko, da ne bi bila pritegnjena k drugim v želji, da bi bila prijatelja.<br/><br/>antagonist<br/><br/>Edini način, da si zaslužiš Kagomejevo jezo, je, da si tako obžalovanja vredna, tako zlobna in daleč od odrešitve, da v tebi ne vidi ničesar dobrega. In dobro vidi v skoraj vsakemu in vsem. Iskreno, s kom se je soočila? Poldemon, ki je postavila dva ljubimca drug proti drugemu, ki je preklinjal celotno moško linijo enega od njenih prijateljev, in potem je brat njenega najboljšega prijatelja pobil njihovo družino ... Lahko pa poskusiš.<br/><br/>romantika<br/><br/>Ko je zaljubljena, je Kagome močna podpora, vedno ostaja tam, tudi ko so stvari lahko grobe. Vendar, Kagome ne išče ljubezni, ni iskal ljubezni, ko je prispela, tako da nobena pretekla razmerja ne obstajajo. To ne pomeni, da se nekdo ni zaljubil vanjo. Zagotovo je lahko predmet nekoga nepovratne ljubezni, čeprav bo verjetno pozabila na to. Končno je Kagome trenutno zaročena s Sesshoumarujem, presenetljivo.

| Why You Should be on Twitter<br/><br/>Disclaimer: I am not, nor have I ever claimed to be, a social media guru. I'm just a person who thinks about stuff a lot, and this has come up a number of times.<br/><br/>I'm not an early adopter. Sometimes it takes me years to figure out what I want to use something for before I actually get on it, and Twitter was one of those things. I've been on Twitter seriously since about February of this year, so I'm pretty new at it. Still, I've learned a number of things, and I wanted to share them. Some people say I'm a Twitter pusher, and I am, because there's lots of good reasons to get on it, and virtually no downsides.<br/><br/>So what's Twitter? If you're on the internet, you've probably at least heard of it. It's a social media network that serves as a forum for conversations, updates, and news in a medium more public than something like Facebook or LinkedIn. Facebook is about who wants to find you, but Twitter is about who you want to find. Your favourite writers, actors, politicians, singers, and scientists are probably on Twitter. So are your favourite charities, radio stations, news sites, and stores. And they want you to find them and listen to what they have to say. Everyone on Twitter, at least initially, wants to talk with you.<br/><br/>But why join that? Why be a part of it? There's all kinds of reasons, and I'm going to give you a few.<br/><br/>People and Places Twitter is a great way to find out about events which are going on around the world, but also in your community. If you're travelling and looking for things to do, it's a great way to find out about things relevant to your interests (because the people you follow are people you're interested in). Even if you're not travelling, knowing about great places to go locally or knowing that people you're interested in are going to them creates an opportunity to meet them and create a deeper relationship with them. If you go back to my party post, all the people in it but two, I heard about on Twitter and then met in real life, and now we're pretty good friends. And the more you do this, the more things you'll find out about, and the more people you'll meet. And if you follow them on Twitter, you already know a bit about what they're like. They want you to. The reverse is also true, because tweeting invites people to see what you're like, and they can make the same choices about you.<br/><br/>Inspiration and Motivation<br/>Inspiration comes from the strangest places, and the influx of tweets means there's always fresh content for your imagination. I have a follow first policy, so I'll follow just about anybody, and then periodically go through and unfollow people. I don't know who's going to plant the seed of a new blog post or new project in me, so I like to keep my options open. Motivation also happens, because Twitter is just like life. If you surround yourself with people who are ambitious, dedicated, generous, and hard-working, it's easier to be like that, and push yourself. It's easier to think that if they can plan events, launch projects, or just get up in the morning, well, so can you.<br/><br/>Learning and Lifestyle Bloggers are on Twitter. Bloggers who aren't may actually be crazy. And people blog about just about everything. If you're looking to learn something, odds are good that somebody's tweeting about it. On top of that, news services and stores are also connected, which means that you can get your news up to the minute, and find out about sales and deals as they start.As far as lifestyle, looking for new recipe ideas? Follow some caterers and see what they come up with. Need a twist for that cocktail party? Twitter's got people for that too. Wardrobe recommendations, or just want to see what other people are doing with their lives? It's all there.<br/><br/>There are some common challenges I face when talking about this, and they're legitimate obstacles. It can seem pretty daunting, especially if you're getting on the bandwagon late, like I did. I spent months following only two people and not knowing what else to do. But there are ways to overcome them, and hear they are from least frequent to most.<br/><br/>#3: Twitter is for Narcissistic Jerks<br/>I think this comes from the idea that most people tweet for and about themselves as a way of getting attention. What I don't get is why there's anything wrong with that, or why doing that makes one a narcissist or a jerk. If someone has something to say, they want to be heard. Used to be you'd stand on the street corner and yell. Now you can yell in 140 characters or less. Twitter's just a new way to be heard. Now, there are certainly narcissistic jerks on Twitter. They're pretty much everywhere. Sometimes, people are jerks. Sometimes one of those people is me, I'm sorry to say. Don't follow those people. If you don't like what someone is saying, whether that's points that they're making or detailed accounts of their bathroom activities, you don't have to listen on Twitter.<br/><br/>#2: I Can't Keep Track of It All<br/>The second obstacle people often bring up is that they just don't have time to keep track of all the things which are going on on Twitter. And you know what? That's fine. Keep track of what you can. Maybe you only wander on every few days. If you're a private user (rather than tweeting for your company), and especially a beginner, that's okay. Part of something is better than all of nothing.<br/><br/>#1 I've Got Nothing I Want to Put Out There<br/>This is by far the most frequent challenge people raise. And it doesn't even matter. You don't have to join Twitter to talk. Join it to listen. Again, your favourite authors, singers, bloggers, and newspapers are on here. This is your chance to listen to them. It's your chance to gain a window into their lives and activities, and they're inviting you to do that. Want to find out what Felicia Day is going to be up to at the San Diego Comic Con? Done. I know people who only listen on Twitter, and that's great. That's what I did for a while. Eventually, maybe you'll find something to tweet about, or make something to tweet about. I hope you do, because I want to hear about it.<br/><br/>In short, if you're not using Twitter, I think you should be. If you're not using it to its full extent, try to. Don't be afraid to follow five hundred people, if all of those people are saying things you're interested in. Invite those people into bits of your life, and see how it's improved by the interaction. I look forward to hearing from you. | Zakaj bi morali biti na Twitterju<br/><br/>Opozorilo: Nisem in nikoli nisem trdil, da sem guru socialnih medijev. Sem samo oseba, ki veliko razmišlja o stvareh, in to se je večkrat pojavilo.<br/><br/>Nisem zgodnji posvojitelj. Včasih potrebujem leta, da ugotovim, za kaj želim nekaj uporabiti, preden dejansko pridem na to, in Twitter je bil ena od teh stvari. Resno sem na Twitterju od februarja letos, zato sem precej nov v tem. Kljub temu sem se naučila veliko stvari in želela sem jih deliti. Nekateri ljudje pravijo, da sem potisnik Twitterja, in sem, ker obstaja veliko dobrih razlogov, da se lotim tega, in praktično ni slabih strani.<br/><br/>Torej, kaj je Twitter? Če ste na internetu, ste verjetno vsaj slišali za to. To je socialno omrežje, ki služi kot forum za pogovore, posodobitve in novice v mediju bolj javno kot nekaj, kot je Facebook ali LinkedIn. Facebook je o tem, kdo vas želi najti, Twitter pa o tem, koga želite najti. Vaši najljubši pisatelji, igralci, politiki, pevci in znanstveniki so verjetno na Twitterju. Prav tako so vaše najljubše dobrodelne organizacije, radijske postaje, novice in trgovine. Hočejo, da jih najdete in poslušate, kar imajo povedati. Vsi na Twitterju, vsaj na začetku, želijo govoriti z vami.<br/><br/>Obstajajo različni razlogi, ki jih bom navedel, in nekaj jih bom navedel.<br/><br/>Ljudje in kraji Twitter je odličen način, da izveste o dogodkih, ki se dogajajo po vsem svetu, pa tudi v vaši skupnosti. Če potujete in iščete stvari za početi, je to odličen način, da ugotovite stvari, ki so pomembne za vaše interese (ker so ljudje, ki jih spremljate, ljudje, ki jih zanimate). Tudi če ne potujete, poznavanje odličnih krajev za obisk na lokalni ravni ali poznavanje ljudi, ki jih zanimajo, ustvarja priložnost, da se z njimi srečate in ustvarite globlji odnos. Če se vrnete na mojo stransko objavo, vse ljudi v njej razen dveh, sem slišal na Twitterju in potem spoznal v resničnem življenju, in zdaj smo precej dobri prijatelji. In bolj ko to počnete, več stvari boste izvedeli in več ljudi boste spoznali. In če jim sledite na Twitterju, že veste malo o tem, kakšni so. Hočejo, da to storite. Prav tako velja tudi obratno, ker tvitanje vabi ljudi, da vidijo, kakšni ste, in lahko o vas izberejo enako.<br/><br/>Navdih in motivacija<br/>Navdih prihaja iz najbolj čudnih krajev, in pritok tweets pomeni, da je vedno sveža vsebina za vašo domišljijo. Imam politiko slediti prvi, tako da bom sledil skoraj vsakomur, nato pa redno iti skozi in ne slediti ljudem. Ne vem, kdo bo v meni posadil seme novega bloga ali novega projekta, zato rad imam odprte možnosti. Motivacija se zgodi tudi, ker je Twitter kot življenje. Če se obkrožate z ljudmi, ki so ambiciozni, predani, velikodušni in trdo delajo, je lažje biti takšen in se potisniti. Lažje je misliti, da če lahko načrtujejo dogodke, začenjajo projekte ali vstanejo zjutraj, lahko tudi vi.<br/><br/>Učenje in življenjski slog Bloggers so na Twitterju. Bloggers, ki niso dejansko lahko nori. In ljudje blog o skoraj vsem. Če iščete, da se naučijo nekaj, so možnosti, da nekdo tweeting o tem. Poleg tega so povezane tudi novičarske storitve in trgovine, kar pomeni, da lahko svoje novice dobite do minute in izvedete o prodaji in poslih, ko se začnejo. Kar se tiče življenjskega sloga, iščete nove ideje za recepte? Sledite nekaterim gostincem in poglejte, kaj so prišli. Potrebujete twist za to koktajl zabavo? Twitter ima tudi ljudi za to. Priporočila za garderobo ali samo želite videti, kaj drugi ljudje počnejo s svojim življenjem? Vse je tam.<br/><br/>Obstaja nekaj pogostih izzivov, s katerimi se soočam, ko govorim o tem, in to so legitimne ovire. To se lahko zdi precej zastrašujoče, še posebej, če ste dobili na bandwagon pozno, kot sem storil. Mesece sem sledil samo dvema ljudema in ne vem, kaj drugega storiti. Vendar obstajajo načini, kako jih premagati in slišati, da so od najmanj pogostih do najbolj.<br/><br/>#3: Twitter je za narcistične kretene<br/>Mislim, da to izhaja iz ideje, da večina ljudi tweet za in o sebi kot način pridobivanja pozornosti. Kar ne razumem, je, zakaj je nekaj narobe s tem, ali zakaj je to naredi narcis ali kreten. Če ima nekdo kaj za povedati, hočejo biti slišani. Včasih bi stali na vogalu ulice in kričali. Zdaj lahko kričite v 140 znakih ali manj. Twitter je samo nov način, da se sliši. Zdaj so zagotovo narcistični kreteni na Twitterju. Povsod so. –Včasih so ljudje kreteni. –Eden od njih sem jaz. –Ne sledi jim. Če vam ni všeč, kaj nekdo pravi, ali so to točke, ki jih ustvarjajo, ali podrobne račune svojih kopalniških dejavnosti, vam ni treba poslušati na Twitterju.<br/><br/># 2 Ne morem slediti vsemu.<br/>Druga ovira, ki jo ljudje pogosto omenjajo, je, da preprosto nimajo časa, da bi spremljali vse stvari, ki se dogajajo na Twitterju. In veste kaj? To je v redu. Spremljajte, kaj lahko. Morda le tavate vsakih nekaj dni. Če ste zasebni uporabnik (namesto tvitanja za vaše podjetje), in še posebej začetnik, je to v redu. Del nečesa je boljši od ničesar.<br/><br/># 1 Ničesar nimam, kar bi rad dal ven.<br/>To je daleč najpogostejši izziv, ki ga ljudje postavljajo. In sploh ni pomembno. Ni se vam treba pridružiti Twitterju, da bi se pogovarjali. Pridružite se mu, da poslušate. Ponovno so tukaj vaši najljubši avtorji, pevci, blogerji in časopisi. To je vaša priložnost, da jim prisluhnete. To je vaša priložnost, da dobite okno v njihova življenja in dejavnosti, in oni vas vabijo, da to storite. Želite izvedeti, kaj Felicia Day se dogaja na San Diego Comic Con? Done. Poznam ljudi, ki samo poslušajo na Twitterju, in to je super. To je tisto, kar sem naredil za nekaj časa. Sčasoma, morda boste našli nekaj, da tweet o, ali pa nekaj, da tweet o. Upam, da boste, ker želim slišati o tem.<br/><br/>Skratka, če ne uporabljate Twitterja, mislim, da bi morali biti. Če ga ne uporabljate v celoti, poskusite. Ne bojte se slediti petsto ljudem, če vsi ti ljudje govorijo stvari, ki vas zanimajo. Povabite te ljudi v dele svojega življenja in poglejte, kako se bo interakcija izboljšala. Veselim se vašega sporočila. |
| Root Canals<br/><br/>The very thought of getting a root canal puts most people on edge. SCM Dental utilizes the latest technology and technique to make a root canal a virtually pain free and low stress procedure.<br/><br/>Rotary endodontics is an advanced technology and technique to perform endodontic treatment, the clinical term for a root canalThe term "root canal" refers to the natural cavity at the center of the tooth. The tooth's nerve is located in soft tissue (pulp) inside the root canal. If the tooth is damaged either by trauma or decay, debris can enter the sensitive root canal area and cause an infection, or in extreme circumstances, and abscess. An abscessed tooth is very serious and should be treated as an emergency, as it can create an infection that may spread to other parts of the body. If you believe you have an abscessed tooth, contact our office immediately to schedule emergency care.<br/><br/>Depending on the case, root canal therapy may require more than one visit. An initial x-ray will be taken to evaluate the tooth and root canal and determine the extent of the damage and infection if present. You will be given a form of anesthesia to make you relaxed.<br/><br/>When the area is numb, our dentist will create an access chamber to the root canal using an electric handpiece. Next, the root canal will be scraped of the infected or damaged tissue and nerve. Once the entire area has been throughly cleaned and polished, the tooth will be filled with a biocompatible rubber compound called gutta percha. The tooth is then covered with a dental filling or dental crown to restore strength and function.<br/><br/>Endodontic therapy has a bad reputation as being a painful procedure. With rotary endodontics, a root canal procedure is no more painful than having a dental filling placed. The infection and damage to the nerve is what creates the extreme pain and discomfort and patients you will experience significant relief after undergoing root canal therapy. Root canals have a success rate of 95% and allow people to preserve their natural teeth. | Root kanali<br/><br/>Sama misel na pridobivanje koreninski kanal postavlja večino ljudi na robu. SCM Dental uporablja najnovejšo tehnologijo in tehniko, da bi koreninski kanal praktično brez bolečin in nizko stres postopek.<br/><br/>Rotacijska endodoncija je napredna tehnologija in tehnika za opravljanje endodontskega zdravljenja, klinični izraz za koreninski kanalIzraz "koreninski kanal" se nanaša na naravno votlino v središču zoba. Zobni živec se nahaja v mehkem tkivu (pulpa) znotraj koreninskega kanala. Če je zob poškodovan zaradi travme ali razpada, lahko ostanki vstopijo v občutljivo območje koreninskega kanala in povzročijo okužbo ali v ekstremnih okoliščinah in absces. Abscested zob je zelo resen in ga je treba obravnavati kot nujni primer, saj lahko povzroči okužbo, ki se lahko razširi na druge dele telesa. Če menite, da imate abscested zob, se takoj obrnite na našo pisarno, da načrtujete nujno pomoč.<br/><br/>Odvisno od primera, terapija korenin kanala lahko zahteva več kot en obisk. Začetni rentgenski posnetek bo ovrednotil zob in koreninski kanal ter določil obseg poškodbe in okužbe, če je prisoten. Dali vam bodo obliko anestezije, da se boste sprostili.<br/><br/>Ko je območje odrevenelo, bo naš zobozdravnik z električnim ročajem ustvaril dostopno komoro do korenskega kanala. Nato bo koreninski kanal odrgnjen iz okuženega ali poškodovanega tkiva in živca. Ko je celotno območje prečiščeno in polirano, bo zob napolnjen z biokompatibilno gumijasto spojino, imenovano gutta percha. Zob je nato prekrit z zobnim polnilom ali zobno krono za obnovitev moči in funkcije.<br/><br/>Endodontska terapija ima slab sloves kot boleč postopek. Z rotacijsko endodontijo postopek korenin ni nič bolj boleč kot zobno polnilo. Okužba in poškodbe živcev je tisto, kar ustvarja skrajno bolečino in nelagodje in bolniki boste doživeli znatno olajšanje po zdravljenju korenin kanala. Koreninski kanali imajo 95% uspešnost in omogočajo ljudem, da ohranijo svoje naravne zobe. |

Houses were demolished without regard for the tenants who had to find whatever accommodation they could elsewhere. Managers went to livo in Kensington and St. John's Wood, while the poorest crowded into the rookeries like Seven Dials and Lisson Grove. For those between, the clerks and skilled workmen, speculative builders put up row after row of terraced villas and Mr Pooter moved into Holloway. The people of Muswell Hill watched houses creep across the fields of Finsbury Park, up Crouch Hill and down the other side, so that by 1880, Crouch End was being developed and there seemed no way to stem the flow. Ten years later the large estates of Muswell Hill were being sold. Upton Farm was sold and the Ecclesiastical Commissioners wanted to develop Churchyard Bottom Wood, now called Queen's Wood. The story would have made an Ibsen play. Two groups of honest, highly motivated people fighting for what they each thought was right. The Ecclesiastical Commissioners on the one hand and the Committee of the Hornsey Charities on the other, both believed they were doing their best for other people, and the public rose against them both in indignation<br/><br/>At that time Muswell Hill Road was a country road, with Southwood Hall at one end and Upton Farm at the other. By 1894, Onslow Gardens was built, Connaught Gardens marked out, and builders were poised to develop the Woodlands estate. Cut out of Churchyard Bottom Wood was a group of tumble-down cottages, on a triangular site. An undated map, held by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners shows six Wasteland Cottages with an opening between them - not a road, not metalled, but a way through to the strawberry beds behind. Further along was another gap which led to footpaths through the wood. These two openings were to be the basis of the plan. The same two gaps and the cleared ground, which was the strawberry field, can be seen in the 1894 map below. They are shown as 'Muswell Hill Cottages' and, quite in passing, Peter Sellers was to live on the same site much later on. To develop the wood as a housing estate, the Commissioners needed to drive two roads through from Muswell Hill Road and build houses along them. The Muswell Hill Road frontage alone would not have provided room for enough houses to make the venture worthwhile.<br/><br/>The land and cottages had been given much earlier as almshouses to house old people and were held on their behalf by the Trustees of the Hornsey Charity Commissioners. By the 1890s the cottages were tumble-down, in need of major repair. Public-spirited, wishing to do the best for their old tenants, the Trustees could not improve them since they had no money. Some years before the Ecclesiastical Commissioners had planned to develop Gravel Pit Wood (now Highgate Wood) as a housing estate, but this had met such opposition that they backed down. Instead, in 1886, they gave all 69 acres woodland to the public. At the same time they offered to sell Churchyard Bottom Wood to Hornsey Urban District Council for £25,000, but this was too much for Hornsey to raise on its own. The Council said that people living outside Hornsey also enjoyed the wood and other authorities should help, but no help was given. In the end the offer fell into abeyance.<br/><br/>Map showing the Muswell Hill Cottages which were the centre of the controversy.<br/><br/>Muswell Hill Road about 1880<br/><br/>It seems probable that these three pairs of cottages<br/>were the ones at the centre of the dispute.<br/><br/>The Ecclesiastical Commissioners wanted to raise money for its church work in Britain and abroad. They considered that they had been given the land to be used for the propogat­ion of religion and if this meant selling off land or woods, it was a lesser evil than restricting the work of the church. They had given Gravel Pit Wood to the public: in its place they would develop Churchyard Bottom Wood.<br/><br/>The Trustees of the Hornsey Charities wanted to produce an income to help their poor people, so they made an offer to the Commissioners. Their triangular piece of land was too awkwardly shaped to be developed economically, but if the Commissioners would grant them some more land to make it into a square site, they would build twenty-five neat villas. These would bring in ground rents of £225 per annum, which could be used to relieve the poverty of Hornsey people. In return they would permit the Commission­ers to cut two roads through their land so that the Commissioners could develop the woods.<br/><br/>When this offer became known people immediately reacted with alarm.<br/><br/>On the 16th December 1893 Mr Carvell Williams MP asked in the House of Commons, if the Ecclesiastical Commissioners had consented to sell a strip of land to the Hornsey Charities Trustees on condition that an existing road be widened to 40 feet, whether this was a preliminary to a building scheme and if the House of Parliament would have an opportunity to express an opinion.<br/><br/>Mr Leveson Gower, a Church Estates Commissioner replied',"Yes" to the first part.<br/><br/>Mr Carvell Williams, "Do I understand it is the intention to destroy that portion of Highgate Woods by building on it?"<br/><br/>Two days later The Star published an article worthy of any modern tabloid.<br/><br/>The Star<br/>18th December 1893<br/><br/>'Parliament must keep a keen watch on those old vandals and confederates of the jerry-builder the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. They are always alienating some piece of land or are favouring the builders as opposed to the general public. The Commissioners would not sell the Churchyard Bottom wood to the ratepayers but now propose 'to open it up' by cutting two wide roads through it in connection with one of their numerous building schemes. Will not someone ask a question in Parliament and check the brick and mortar policy of the Commissioners?'<br/><br/>By the time this was printed, the question had been asked and the answer was either untrue, or devious. Other papers took up the story. The Times, in a long report, said that the Comnussioners were not prepared to give an undertaking that Parliament, or any other public body, should have an opportunity of considering any scheme for building on the site of the wood.<br/><br/>The situation simmered for eighteen months until the Ecclesiastical Commissioners were forced to open an enquiry, which began at Highgate on 31 May 1895, chaired by an Assistant Ecclesiastical Commissioner. The Inquiry produced a flurry of newspaper letters of which this was the most important.<br/><br/>The Daily Chronicle, 5 June 1895<br/><br/>VANDALISM AT HIGHGATE<br/><br/>Sir –<br/><br/>One of the most lovely bits of woodland in suburan London is threatened. Will you help us to ward off what would be a calamity, not only to the immediate district, but to the whole of densely-populated North London? In no part of the metropolis has the builder been more active than in Crouch End and Hornsey. The beautiful meadows of a year or two ago are now houses and shops. Ballast heaps have taken the place of stately elms and chestnuts, and once pleasant villages are sharing the fate of Stroud Green, Harringay, Finsbury Park, Highbury and Islington. ---<br/><br/>---- The object is the construction of two forty-foot roads through the woods. We in this district know the meaning of forty-foot roads through woods. It means that the woods are doomed. Ten years ago agitation saved the sister-wood of sixty-five acres - The Gravel Pit Woods - and no one who saw the Bank Holiday crowds flocking up the Archway Road from the dreary streets of Holloway, Islington and Clerkenwell, and watched the keen enjoyment of the children and family parties picnicking on the grass and among the trees, could fail to realise the immense boon that the grant by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners of this wood has been to the whole of North London, but the Lower Wood of sixty acres has always been regarded as a natural complement of the other. ----<br/><br/>--- The Ecclesiastical Commissioners own nearly one-third of the large parish of Hornsey. By the liberal expenditure of the ratepayers' money in the opening up of roads and the general development of the district, the value of their property has been enormously increased, and from this unearned increment they each year draw large revenues. Surely the ratepayers whose money has thus aided in creating the immense estate may expect liberal treatment in return. ---<br/><br/>Yours obediently,<br/><br/>Signed by The Vicar of St James', Muswell Hill, the Minister of Park Chapel, Crouch End, a barrister living in Onslow Gardens and three members of the District Council.<br/><br/>It was a shot right across the bows of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. Their own religious leaders and the District Council, all up in arms saying in effect that the church was too rich and should be charitable, not greedy. The inclusion of the two clergymen was a shrewd move. Remember to that this was still in the height of the Darwin controversy. Darwin had split belief in the teachings of the Church and many people would have resented the power of the Church from that point of view alone. The Church was not so secure as it pretended to be.<br/><br/>The Evening News, 7 June 1895 said:-<br/><br/>"If the Ecclesiastical Comnussioners are not tackled at once, the building octopus will get a grip of the wood which will be very difficult to loosen later on, ---. Therefore it behoves Londoners to be up and doing if they would save one of their most delightful bits of rustic scenery. The public inquiry stands adjourned to Thursday next, and before then something must be done to convince the Commissioners that the citizens of London will not tolerate the confiscation of one of their favourite playgrounds."<br/><br/>A letter in the Daily Chronicle the next day said:-<br/><br/>.... It was with great relief that that the residents, some ten years ago, heard that the purchase of the Upper Wood had been effected; and how delightful a boon this has proved, anyone who visited them can testify, but all who exerted themselves to save these upper woods, which lie on the west side of Muswell Hill road, felt that their victory was incomplete so long as the sixty acres on the east side remained in danger. It is, as it were, an accident that the woods are divided by a broad high road. Can anyone doubt what the effect would be if the Churchyard Bottom Wood were replaced by rows of small villas, each sending out its contribution of smoke and soot? Can anyone doubt, too, the serious difference it would make to the picturesque setting of the purchased woods if a line of staring new houses were to be run up right over against their leafy frontage?'<br/><br/>This expressed the opinions of many people. In fact, the Gravel Pit Wood, which the writer calls the 'Upper Wood', had not been purchased, but given to the district by the Ecclesiastical Commission, a point they were to reiterate time and again over the years, but most people ignored it. The Commission was not going to give away a second wood whatever anyone said, and held this position to the end.<br/><br/>H.S.Chamberlain, of 5 Cranley Gardens,<br/>in a letter to the Times dated June 8, 1895, urged purchase.<br/><br/>I know that it is common to speak harshly of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, but as the trustees of a fund they are bound to administer it to the greatest advantage, and therefore, if anything is to be done to save the demolition of the wood, it appears to me that it can only be effected by the purchase of the property from the Comnussioners, who I know, are fully alive to the protection of free and open spaces for the people, and who, I feel sure, would be disposed to treat the matter of a purchase in a free and liberal spirit, as they have already done in the matter of the Shepherd's Cot-field, by granting a lease to the Crouch End Playing-fields Company - a small company in which I own a few shares, a small company which was formed exclusively for the purpose of securing the fields for cricket, tennis etc.<br/><br/>(This refers the the Crouch End Playing Fields which had been secured a few years later.)<br/><br/>As Chairman of the Muswell Hill Conservative Association, I am constantly in touch with the inhabitants, and I can safely affirm that every person resident in the neighbourhood would do anything in reason to preserve.<br/><br/>(All he wanted personally was Charity income to support his poor people. He demanded his acre of land - not a great deal surely - he believed the Commissioners' assurance that the wood was not in danger.)<br/><br/>' Muswell Hill Road was one of the best in Hornsey and would remain equally beautiful, houses or no houses',<br/><br/>(and then came the great rhetorical flourish.)<br/><br/>'Are the poor to suffer because of the sentimental objections and the hysterical cry of 'wolf just raised by your correspondents? Something must be done and that soon. An acre of back-land added to the charity-estate would make no apprec­iable difference to the land remaining, while the profit derived from it would succour many poor old and deserving persons in their declining years and enable us to hand over to our successors an estate which in the distant future would be of great value in the rendering of charitable aid to the deserving poor of the parish of Hornsey.'<br/><br/>Reading his letter one senses hysteria very near the surface. Why did he think the Commissioners wanted to build a road? Why should they spend all that money if not to build houses? He never seemed to realise that for an acre of land the the whole wood would be lost. But he had been with the problem for a long time. He was the person to whom the Commissioners had made the offer of sale for £25,000 years before and it is his name which is honoured in a plaque on Crouch End Clock Tower for saving the wood, but his trust in the Ecclesiastical Commissioners seems naive. It is sad that at the Inquiry he was to be cast as the devil.<br/><br/>The Inquiry Continued<br/><br/>The adjourned opened in Highgate on 15 June 1895. Expecting a large gather­ing, the Council Chamber had been changed completely. The usual tables had been removed and the room filled with chairs. By half past seven the room was crowded, with people jostling for seats.<br/><br/>Mr Murray, the Commissioner, said the Inquiry was really a simple one. Hornsey Parochial Charities wished to purchase a piece of land adjoining their charity property at the back. The question was whether the Charity Commission, which controlled all charities, had enough power to stop them. The Church Commissioners were prepared to sell the land at very favourable terms and the income of the Charity would be very considerable increased.<br/><br/>Against this there were three classes of objection.<br/><br/>The original Trust was for the purpose of providing cottages for the Poor, but the trustees were proposing to build villas which would be too expensive for the Poor. However, it was within the power of the Trustees to vary the terms of the Trust, so they could build villas if they thought that the Poor would benefit in the end. The poor people themselves might object, but liberal provisions had already been promised for them. The third objection related to the aesthetic and public side of the question. He took it from what he had read that the Charity Commission ought to interfere to prevent the Ecclesiastical Commissioners from exercising their own discretion in dealing with their own property.<br/><br/>The Inquiry discussed fine points, but the speakers kept coming back to the major problem of preventing any destruction of the wood. The Vestry Clerk of Islington, representing 300,000 people, made a formal protest about any part of the wood, so valuable for the people of Islington and Hornsey being used for private purposes. Mr Wilfred White said that if the Commissioners would give them time they would be able to raise the money to compensate the Trustees.<br/><br/>Mr Beaumont said they did not want villas, they wanted cottages for poor people who were being driven out of the district. Others said that there was no money to build cottages to replace the present delapidated ones but villas would be an economic proposition. Others retorted that there were score of villas to let in Highgate. The Wood was sacred. Stick to the question of the Wood.<br/><br/>Dr Fletcher said the cry among the working people was that there was nowhere to go. Working people came to him with the cry, "We are driven out of Highgate and are obliged to go to Highgate New Town." If the Muswell Hill Road frontage was sold there was no question but that roads might be cut right through the woods in the direction of Hornsey, but if the Commissioners could not get the land from the Charity Commission they could not cut the road.<br/><br/>He was very sure the cottages could be put into a fit state of repair. He was asked by the poor people, by the police and by a number of the working classes to represent these two points, that cottage accommodation was very sorely needed in Highgate and that if they once allowed the land to be sold, there was no telling where the hand of the builder would be stayed.<br/><br/>(Loud and prolonged cheers).<br/><br/>Numerous other people spoke and the Comnussioner summed up by saying that he took it that the prevailing opinion was in favour of retaining the cottages but the meeting should draw no conclusions from what he had said (Groans).<br/><br/>Others said that the Trustees of the Charity had failed in their duties by letting the the cottages fall into disrepair.<br/><br/>Mr H.R.Williams, the Trustee who had written to the paper earlier, said that he had it on the best authority that the Church Commissioners would make no roads whatever and they would not be benefitted one iota by the actions of the Charity Commissioners. Others were far less trusting and the meeting closed after nearly three hours.<br/><br/>'We are faced with the fact that in Highgate and Muswell Hill there are a number of persons who want the Churchyard Bottom Wood and will not be happy until they have got it - while nobody appears willing to spend a farthing to pay for it. Everyone says it would be a fine thing to have the wood as open space, but everybody thinks it is the duty of someone else to make it one. The Islington Vestry has 'resolved' on the subject, but the Islington Vestry does not offer a penny piece towards the purchase. --- There is no more difficult problem for the community or the individual to solve than how to gain possession of other people's property without paying for it.'<br/><br/>Paying for it was indeed the problem as Churchyard Bottom Wood became the subject of intense local and national debate. A joint committee was formed to raise money to save the wood. On 20 November 1896, C.F.Cory-Wright, Hon Treasurer, wrote to The Standard, a daily paper at that time, appealing for help. He reminded everyone of the danger of losing the wood and said it could only be saved by buying it. The Church Commissioners would sell for £25,000 and an extra (5,000 would be required for fencing and drainage, making a total of £30,000. This was too much for Hornsey Council to raise but they had already voted £10,000 towards the total. The woods were of inestimable value to all of North London so he appealed to public bodies and private people to raise the remaining £20,000. He warned that the present offer from the Church Commissioners was open only to the end of 1898. After that the builders would move in.<br/><br/>The appeal was warmly welcomed by the press. A Private Bill was rushed through Parliament and the Highgate Woods Preservation Act, 1897, became law. The Conunittee now had the right to advertise for contributions towards buying the Wood and preserving it.<br/><br/>In a fairly short time almost all the money was raised, but the last few thousand proved very difficult to raise and the Commissioners' deadline was a matter of weeks away. Mr Cory-Wright wrote pleading for more time but was granted a mere three months and then only if interest at 4 per cent was paid for the extra period on the full sum. In the end the London County Council, which had originally offered £2,500, made this up to £5,000 and the total was reached, but it was a close-run thing.<br/><br/>The Council decided to re-name the Wood as 'Queen's Woods' in honour of Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee and Hornsey put on a fine display of bunting when the Duchess of Albany formally declared the Wood open 'for the free use of the public for ever'.<br/><br/>While the campaign to save Churchyard Bottom Wood was run and directed by local people who felt passionately about this particular piece of woodland, they called on the help and experience of a vast network of people, some of whom had worked together on similar campaigns for over thirty years. The Committee issued an appeal, printed on very good quality paper and bearing some famous names.<br/><br/>The questions of open space and public health were major subjects of the Victorian vision.<br/><br/>The Open Spaces Movement<br/><br/>Octavia Hill, the great housing reformer, who had begun with three old houses in Marylebone, bought for her by Jolm Ruskin, had quickly become an expert on housing poor people in the healthiest conditions possible. Her way was to buy leases and then knock down some of the crowded houses in order to bring light and air to the rest, believing that fresh air and sunlight were the the only way poor people could be saved from 'putrid fever. She had learnt this as a child from her grandfather, Southwood Smith, who developed his theories at the Fever Hospital at King's Cross.<br/><br/>He had built the first Industrial Dwellings for poor people and had proved statistically that good air and decent drainage saved lives. Gibson Gardens, in Northwold Road, is a direct outcome of Southwood Smith's ideas. More Information on Gibson Gardens<br/><br/>The Importance of Open Air<br/><br/>Open spaces and the opportunity to breathe clean air, were essential for people living in one or two crowded rooms. Octavia Hill took her charges from the Lisson Grove slums, up Fitzjohn's Avenue to Hampstead Heath. She so loved the Fitzjohn's Avenue fields that she tried to buy them as a public park. They were to cost £10,000 and within three August weeks £8,500 had been raised. It needed only the end of the summer holidays and the return from holiday of sympathetic friends and the further £1,500 would have been raised, but the owners suddenly withdrew their offer. Despite all pleading, the fields were covered with large houses.<br/><br/>From this developed the campaign to save Parliament Hill, the next open space northwards from Lisson Grove, buying up fields in the path of the builders to make a permanent cordon sanitalre against the advancing bricks. The Parliament Hill Fields campaign was so successful that the Hampstead Heath Bill was passed and there was money over from the appeal. From this money and the impetus towards open spaces, was to develop the National Trust. Octavia Hill had been interested in protecting areas like Church Bottom Wood for years, so she was a natural ally in the fight to save the Wood.<br/><br/>The Commons Preservation Society also, was familiar with this kind of agitation and money collection. They had torn down fencing when lords of the manor had enclosed pieces of common land, leading both legal and illegal battles against the arrogant privatization of land traditionally free. Robert Hunter, their Honorary Solicitor from 1868, was always concerned with securing open spaces, large or small, for the public. He, now Sir Robert Hunter, became the Chairman of the Church Bottom Appeal. The Chairman of the Commons Preservation Society was Mr Shaw-Lefevre MP (later Lord Eversley) who played a big part in this and other campaigns in the House of Commons. Octavia Hill had been involved in their work from about 1875.<br/><br/>At the same time Octavia Hill was campaigning for a Burials Bill.<br/><br/>City churchyards had become so full and such a serious a hazard to health, by contaminating wells from which people drew their drinking water, that City burials were no longer permitted. Instead, cemetries were created on the outskirts of town. Abney Park Cemetary was one of these. There was then a movement to remove the headstones to the edges of the old town cemetries, re-inter the bodies elsewhere and turn the cemetries into gardens and open spaces, instead of building on them. This land in the centre of London was very valuable and speculators were avid to obtain it: Even the Quakers had built over one of their cemetries and threatened to do so again by building over Bunhill Fields. Octavia Hill had a network of allies in a dozen fields, so her help to save the Church Bottom Wood must have been invaluable.<br/><br/>The Metropolitan Gardens Society, set up in 1882, had laid out about two hundred small gardens in city centres by 1890. They later handed them over to the Local Authorities, so their support for the Churchyard Bottom Wood Appeal was assured from the start.<br/><br/>The Kyrle Society is forgotten now, but in its day had great influence on Town Planning and Open Space legislation. The Society had been set up about 1875 for 'the Diffusion of Beauty', to bring colour and interest into the lives of people living in dull, drab surroundings. Bright colour to walls and decoration, good singing, open spaces, Nature, Literature and Art. All these fell within the Society's remit. There was a Decorative Branch, for whom William Morris lectured; a Musical Branch to promote choirs and Happy Evenings for people in local school buildings; and a Literature Branch. The Society appealed regularly by letters in The Times, to 'the richer classes' for books and periodicals to be distributed to boys' and girls' clubs, almshouses and elsewhere. However the Open Spaces Committee was the most active. The very name 'Kyrle' came from Pope's The Man of Ross, the philanthropist who gave his birthplace to the people as a public park. | Churchyard Bottom Wood<br/><br/>Highgate<br/><br/>Cerkveno dvorišče Bottom Wood, Highgate<br/><br/>Imenuje se Queen's Wood.<br/><br/>Med letoma 1860 in 1880 je bilo središče iztrgano iz Londona, da bi zgradili kanalizacijo, železnice in nove ceste. Hiše so bile porušene, ne glede na najemnike, ki so morali najti vse nastanitve, ki so jih lahko drugje. Upravitelji so se odpravili v Kensington in St. John's Wood, najrevnejši pa so se gnečali v gostilnah, kot sta Seven Dials in Lisson Grove. Za tiste med njimi, uradniki in usposobljeni delavci, špekulativni gradbeniki so postavili vrsto za vrsto terasastih vil in g. Pooter se je preselil v Holloway. Prebivalci Muswell Hilla so opazovali, kako se hiše plazijo čez polja Finsbury Parka, navzgor po hribu Crouch in navzdol po drugi strani, tako da se je do leta 1880 razvijal Crouch End in zdelo se je, da ni mogoče ustaviti toka. Deset let kasneje so prodali velika posestva na Muswell Hillu. Uptonova kmetija je bila prodana in cerkveni komisarji so želeli razviti Churchyard Bottom Wood, zdaj imenovan Queen's Wood. Zgodba bi bila Ibsenova igra. Dve skupini poštenih, visoko motiviranih ljudi, ki se borijo za tisto, kar so mislili, da je prav. Cerkveni komisarji na eni strani in odbor dobrodelnih organizacij Hornsey na drugi strani so verjeli, da delajo vse, kar je v njihovi moči, za druge ljudi, in javnost je vstala zoper oba v ogorčenosti.<br/><br/>V tistem času je bila Muswell Hill Road podeželska cesta, s Southwood Hall na enem koncu in Upton Farm na drugem. Do leta 1894 so bili zgrajeni vrtovi Onslow, označeni vrtovi Connaught in gradbeniki so bili pripravljeni razviti posestvo Woodlands. Izrezan iz Churchyard Bottom Wooda je bila skupina potopljenih koč, na trikotnem mestu. Nedatirani zemljevid, ki ga hranijo cerkveni komisarji, prikazuje šest Koča z odprtino med njimi - ne cesta, ne kovinska, ampak pot do jagodnih postelj zadaj. Nadalje je bila še ena vrzel, ki je vodila do pešpoti skozi les. Ti dve odprtini naj bi bili osnova načrta. Enake dve vrzel in očiščeno zemljišče, ki je bilo jagodno polje, je mogoče videti na zemljevidu 1894 spodaj. Prikazani so kot "Muswell Hill Cottages" in, mimogrede, Peter Sellers je moral živeti na istem mestu veliko kasneje. Za razvoj lesa kot stanovanjskega naselja so morali komisarji voziti dve cesti od ceste Muswell Hill Road in vzdolž njiju zgraditi hiše. Sama fronta Muswell Hill Road ne bi zagotovila dovolj prostora za hiše, da bi se podvig splačal.<br/><br/>Zemljišče in koče so bile podeljene veliko prej kot miloščine za bivanje starejših ljudi in so jih v njihovem imenu imeli skrbniki dobrodelnih komisarjev Hornseyja. Do 1890-ih so bile koče propadle, ki so potrebovale večja popravila. Skrbniki, ki so bili v javnem duhu in so želeli narediti najboljše za svoje stare najemnike, jih niso mogli izboljšati, ker niso imeli denarja. Nekaj let pred tem so cerkveni komisarji načrtovali razvoj Gramoznega jamskega lesa (zdaj Highgate Wood) kot stanovanjskega naselja, vendar se je to srečalo s takšnim nasprotovanjem, da so se umaknili. Namesto tega so leta 1886 javnosti dali vseh 69 hektarjev gozdov. Hkrati so ponudili prodajo Churchyard Bottom Wooda mestnemu okrožnemu svetu Hornseyja za 25.000 funtov, vendar je bilo to preveč za Hornseyja, da bi ga zbral sam. Svet je dejal, da so tudi ljudje, ki živijo zunaj Hornseyja, uživali v lesu in da bi morale druge oblasti pomagati, vendar ni bilo pomoči. Na koncu je ponudba padla.<br/><br/>Zemljevid prikazuje Muswell Hill Cottages, ki so bili središče polemike.<br/><br/>Muswell Hill Road okoli leta 1880<br/><br/>Zdi se verjetno, da so bili ti trije pari koč v središču spora.<br/><br/>Cerkveni komisarji so želeli zbrati denar za svoje cerkveno delo v Veliki Britaniji in tujini. Menili so, da so jim dali zemljo, da bi jo uporabili za promocijo vere, in če je to pomenilo prodajo zemlje ali gozda, je bilo to manjše zlo kot omejevanje dela cerkve. Javnosti so dali Gravel Pit Wood: na njegovem mestu bi razvili Churchyard Bottom Wood.<br/><br/>Skrbniki dobrodelnih organizacij Hornsey so želeli ustvariti dohodek, da bi pomagali svojim revnim ljudem, zato so komisarjem dali ponudbo. Njihov trikotni kos zemljišča je bil preveč nerodno oblikovan, da bi ga bilo mogoče gospodarsko razviti, toda če bi jim komisarji dodelili nekaj več zemljišča, da bi ga spremenili v kvadratno območje, bi zgradili petindvajset urejenih vil. Ti bi prinesli najemnine za zemljišča v višini 225 £ letno, ki bi jih lahko uporabili za lajšanje revščine prebivalcev Hornseya, v zameno pa bi Komisiji dovolili, da prek njihove zemlje prereže dve cesti, da bi komisarji lahko razvili gozdove.<br/><br/>Ko je ta ponudba postala znana, so se ljudje takoj odzvali z alarmom.<br/><br/>16. decembra 1893 je poslanec Carvell Williams v spodnjem domu vprašal, ali so se cerkveni komisarji strinjali s prodajo pasu zemljišča skrbnikom dobrodelnih organizacij Hornsey pod pogojem, da se obstoječa cesta razširi na 40 čevljev, ali je to predhodna gradbena shema in ali bo parlament imel priložnost izraziti mnenje.<br/><br/>Gospod Leveson Gower, cerkveni komisar za premoženje, je na prvi del odgovoril z "da".<br/><br/>G. Carvell Williams, "Ali razumem, da nameravate uničiti tisti del Highgate Woodsa z gradnjo na njem?"<br/><br/>Dva dni kasneje je The Star objavil članek, vreden vsakega sodobnega tabloida.<br/><br/>Zvezda<br/>18. december 1893<br/><br/>"Parlament mora pozorno spremljati te stare vandale in konfederacije gradbenikov, cerkvenih komisarjev, ki vedno odtujujejo kak kos zemlje ali dajejo prednost graditeljem v nasprotju s splošno javnostjo. Komisarji ne bi prodajali lesa iz Churchyard Bottom plačnikom pristojbin, ampak zdaj predlagajo, da ga "odpremo" tako, da prek njega prerežemo dve široki cesti v povezavi z eno od njihovih številnih gradbenih shem. Ali ne bo kdo v Parlamentu postavil vprašanja in preveril politiko komisarjev glede opeke in malte?'<br/><br/>V času, ko je bilo to natisnjeno, je bilo vprašanje zastavljeno in odgovor je bil bodisi neresničen ali zahrbten. Časopis Times je v dolgem poročilu navedel, da Comnussioners niso pripravljeni dati zaveze, da bi Parlament ali kateri koli drug javni organ moral imeti možnost razmisliti o kakršni koli shemi za gradnjo na mestu lesa.<br/><br/>Razmere so se vlekle osemnajst mesecev, dokler niso bili cerkveni komisarji prisiljeni začeti preiskave, ki se je začela na Highgatu 31. maja 1895, ki ji je predsedoval pomočnik cerkvenega komisarja. Poizvedba je povzročila naval časopisnih pisem, od katerih je bilo to najpomembnejše.<br/><br/>Dnevna kronika, 5. junij 1895<br/><br/>VANDALIZEM NA VISOKIH OBMOČJIH<br/><br/>Gospod –<br/><br/>Ali nam boste pomagali preprečiti nesrečo, ki bi bila katastrofalna, ne samo za neposredno okrožje, ampak za celoten gosto naseljen severni London? V nobenem delu metropole ni bil graditelj bolj aktiven kot v Crouch Endu in Hornseyu. Lepi travniki pred letom ali dvema so zdaj hiše in trgovine. Balastne kupe so prevzele mesto veličastnih brestov in kostanjev, nekdaj prijetne vasi pa delijo usodo Stroud Green, Harringay, Finsbury Park, Highbury in Islington.<br/><br/>---- Predmet je gradnja dveh štirideset metrov cest skozi gozd. V tem okrožju poznamo pomen štirideset metrov cest skozi gozd. To pomeni, da so gozdovi obsojeni. Pred desetimi leti je agitacija rešila sestrski les na petinšestdeset hektarjev - Gravel Pit Woods - in nihče, ki je videl množice Bank Holiday, ki so se zbirale po Archway Road iz suhih ulic Hollowaya, Islingtona in Clerkenwella, in gledal, kako otroci in družinske zabave piknikirajo na travi in med drevesi, lahko ne zavedajo ogromnega lesa. ----<br/><br/>Cerkveni komisarji imajo v lasti skoraj tretjino velike župnije Hornsey. Z liberalno porabo denarja davkoplačevalcev za odpiranje cest in splošnim razvojem okrožja se je vrednost njihovega premoženja izjemno povečala in iz tega nezasluženega povečanja vsako leto črpajo velike prihodke. Zagotovo lahko plačniki stopenj, katerih denar je tako pomagal pri ustvarjanju ogromnega premoženja, pričakujejo liberalno obravnavo v zameno.<br/><br/>Tvoje pokorščine,<br/><br/>Podpisal je vikar svetega Jamesa, Muswell Hill, minister za Park Chapel, Crouch End, odvetnik, ki živi v Onslow Gardens in trije člani okrožnega sveta.<br/><br/>To je bil strel čez lok cerkvenih komisarjev. Njihovi verski voditelji in okrožni svet, vsi v orožju, pravijo, da je cerkev v resnici preveč bogata in bi morala biti dobrodelna, ne pohlepna. Vključitev obeh duhovnikov je bila pametna poteza. Spomnimo se, da je bilo to še vedno na vrhuncu Darwinovega spora. Darwin je razdelil vero v cerkvene nauke in mnogi bi zamerili moči Cerkve samo s tega vidika. Cerkev ni bila tako varna, kot se je pretvarjala, da je.<br/><br/>V večernih novicah, 7. junija 1895, je pisalo:<br/><br/>Če se cerkveni sogovorniki ne bodo takoj spopadli, bo gradbena hobotnica zgrabila les, ki ga bo kasneje zelo težko sprostiti. Zato bi Londončani morali biti in delati, če bi rešili enega svojih najbolj čudovitih koščkov rustikalne pokrajine. Javna preiskava je prestavljena na naslednji četrtek, pred tem pa je treba komisarje prepričati, da državljani Londona ne bodo tolerirali zaplembe enega od njihovih najljubših igrišč.“<br/><br/>Pismo v Daily Chronicle naslednji dan je pisalo:<br/><br/>..... Bilo je z velikim olajšanjem, da so prebivalci, pred kakimi desetimi leti, slišali, da je bil nakup Zgornjega gozda opravljen; in kako čudovito blagor se je to izkazalo, lahko vsak, ki jih je obiskal, priča, toda vsi, ki so se trudili rešiti te zgornje gozdove, ki ležijo na zahodni strani ceste Muswell Hill, so menili, da je njihova zmaga nepopolna, dokler je šestdeset hek na vzhoda na vzhodni strani ostaja v nevarnosti. Nesreča je, da je gozd razdeljen s široko visoko cesto. Ali lahko kdo dvomi, kakšen bi bil učinek, če bi bil Les dna cerkve zamenjan z vrstami majhnih vil, od katerih vsaka pošilja svoj prispevek dima in saje? Ali lahko kdo dvomi tudi o resni razliki, ki bi jo imela slikovita okolica kupljenega gozda, če bi se črta strmečih novih hiš zatekla naravnost proti njihovi listnati fronti?«<br/><br/>To je izrazilo mnenje številnih ljudi. Dejansko Škrlatni jamski les, ki ga pisatelj imenuje »Gornji les«, ni bil kupljen, ampak ga je cerkvena komisija dala okrožju, kar so morali skozi leta ponavljati znova in znova, vendar ga je večina ljudi ignorirala. Komisija ni nameravala dati drugega lesa, ne glede na to, kaj je kdo rekel, in je to stališče ohranila do konca.<br/><br/>H. S. Chamberlain, iz 5 Cranley Gardens, v pismu Timesu z dne 8. junija 1895, je pozval k nakupu.<br/><br/>Vem, da je običajno ostro govoriti o cerkvenih komisarjih, toda kot maloštevilni skrbniki sklada so ga dolžni upravljati za največjo korist, in zato, če je treba kaj storiti, da bi rešili rušenje lesa, se mi zdi, da je to mogoče storiti le z nakupom premoženja od Comnussioners, ki jih poznam, so popolnoma živi za zaščito prostora in se počutim zastonj.<br/><br/>(To se nanaša na igrišča Crouch End, ki so bila zavarovana nekaj let kasneje.)<br/><br/>Kot predsednik konservativnega združenja Muswell Hill sem nenehno v stiku z prebivalci in lahko varno potrdim, da bi vsaka oseba, ki živi v soseski, storila vse, da bi ohranila.<br/><br/>(Osebno je želel samo dobrodelne prihodke za podporo svojih revnih ljudi. Zahteval je svoj hektar zemlje - ne veliko zagotovo - verjel je, da je zagotovilo komisarjev, da les ni ogrožen.)<br/><br/>Muswell Hill Road je bila ena najboljših v Hornseyu in bi ostala enako lepa, hiše ali brez hiš.<br/><br/>(In potem je prišlo do velikega retoričnega razcveta.)<br/><br/>Ali bodo revni trpeli zaradi sentimentalnih nasprotovanj in histeričnega krika volka, ki so ga pravkar vzbudili vaši dopisniki? Hektar zaledja, ki bi bil dodan dobrodelnemu posestvu, ne bi bistveno spremenil preostale zemlje, medtem ko bi dobiček, ki bi iz tega izhajal, pomagal mnogim ubogim starim in vrednim osebam v njihovih upadajočih letih in nam omogočil, da bi našim naslednikom predali posest, ki bi bila v daljni prihodnosti zelo dragocena pri zagotavljanju dobrodelne pomoči vrednim revcem župnije Hornsey.<br/><br/>Ob branju njegovega pisma čutimo histerijo zelo blizu površja. Zakaj je mislil, da komisarji želijo zgraditi cesto? Zakaj bi porabili ves ta denar, če ne za gradnjo hiš? Nikoli se ni zavedal, da bo za en hektar zemlje izgubljen ves les, vendar je bil s težavo že dolgo časa. Bil je oseba, ki so ji komisarji že pred 25.000 leti ponudili prodajo za 25.000 £, njegovo ime pa je na plaketi na stolpu Crouch End Clock Tower počaščeno zaradi varčevanja z lesom, vendar se zdi njegovo zaupanje v cerkvene komisarje naivno. Žalostno je, da je bil v preiskavi vržen kot hudič.<br/><br/>Preiskava se nadaljuje<br/><br/>Prekinitev se je odprla 15. junija 1895 v Highgateu. Pričakovali so veliko zborovanje, zato je bila sejna dvorana popolnoma spremenjena. Običajne mize so bile odstranjene in soba je bila napolnjena s stoli. Ob pol sedmih je bila soba polna ljudi, ki so se borili za sedeže.<br/><br/>Gospod Murray, komisar, je dejal, da je bila preiskava v resnici preprosta in da so župnijske dobrodelne organizacije Hornsey želele kupiti zemljišče, ki je obkrožalo njihovo dobrodelno lastnino zadaj. Vprašanje je bilo, ali ima dobrodelna komisija, ki nadzoruje vse dobrodelne organizacije, dovolj moči, da jih ustavi. Cerkveni komisarji so bili pripravljeni prodati zemljišče pod zelo ugodnimi pogoji in prihodek od dobrodelnosti bi se zelo povečal.<br/><br/>Proti temu so bile tri vrste ugovorov.<br/><br/>Prvotni Trust je bil namenjen zagotavljanju koč za revne, vendar so skrbniki predlagali gradnjo vil, ki bi bile predrage za revne. Vendar pa je bilo v pristojnosti skrbnikov, da spreminjajo pogoje zaupanja, tako da bi lahko gradili vile, če bi mislili, da bi revni na koncu imeli koristi. Revni ljudje bi lahko sami ugovarjali, vendar so jim bile že obljubljene liberalne določbe. Tretji ugovor se je nanašal na estetsko in javno stran vprašanja. Iz tega, kar je prebral, je vzel, da se mora dobrodelna komisija vmešavati, da bi cerkvenim komisarjem preprečila, da bi pri ravnanju z lastnim premoženjem izvajali svojo diskrecijsko pravico.<br/><br/>Poizvedba je razpravljala o dobrih točkah, vendar so se govorniki še naprej vračali k glavnemu problemu preprečevanja kakršnega koli uničenja lesa. Nosilni uradnik iz Islingtona, ki je zastopal 300.000 ljudi, je uradno protestiral proti kateremu koli delu lesa, ki je bil tako dragocen za ljudi v Islingtonu in Hornseyu, ki so ga uporabljali za zasebne namene. Wilfred White je dejal, da bi lahko, če bi jim komisarji dali čas, zbrali denar za nadomestilo skrbnikom.<br/><br/>Beaumont je dejal, da nočejo vil, ampak koče za revne ljudi, ki so bili izgnani iz okrožja. Drugi so rekli, da ni bilo denarja za gradnjo koč, ki bi nadomestile sedanje razpadle, vendar bi bile vile ekonomski predlog. Drugi so odgovorili, da je bilo veliko vil, ki bi jih lahko spustili v Highgate. Gozd je bil sveti. Ostanite pri vprašanju lesa.<br/><br/>Dr. Fletcher je dejal, da je krik med delavci bil, da ni kam iti. Delavci so prišli k njemu s krikom, "Mi smo pregnani iz Highgate in so dolžni iti v Highgate New Town." Če je bila prodana ulica Muswell Hill Road, ni bilo nobenega dvoma, da se lahko ceste prerežejo naravnost skozi gozd v smeri Hornseyja, če pa komisarji ne morejo dobiti zemljišča od dobrodelne komisije, ne morejo prerezati ceste.<br/><br/>Prepričan je bil, da je mogoče koče postaviti v primerno stanje popravila. Revni ljudje, policija in številni delavski razredi so ga prosili, naj zastopa te dve točki, da je v Highgateu zelo potrebna nastanitev v koči in da, če bodo enkrat dovolili prodajo zemljišča, ni bilo znano, kje bo ostala gradbenikova roka.<br/><br/>(Glasno in dolgotrajno veselje).<br/><br/>Številni drugi ljudje so govorili in Comnussioner povzel, ko je dejal, da je sprejel, da je prevladujoče mnenje v prid ohranitve koč, vendar srečanje ne bi smelo sklepati iz tega, kar je rekel (Stoni).<br/><br/>Drugi so dejali, da skrbniki dobrodelne organizacije niso izpolnili svojih dolžnosti, saj so pustili, da se hiše pokvarijo.<br/><br/>Gospod H.R. Williams, skrbnik, ki je pisal časopisu prej, je dejal, da ima najboljše pooblastilo, da cerkveni komisarji ne bodo gradili cest in da jim ukrepi dobrodelnih komisarjev ne bodo koristili. Drugi so bili veliko manj zaupljivi in sestanek se je po skoraj treh urah končal.<br/><br/>"Soočamo se z dejstvom, da v Highgateu in Muswell Hillu obstajajo številni ljudje, ki želijo Churchyard Bottom Wood in ne bodo srečni, dokler ga ne dobijo - medtem ko se zdi, da nihče ni pripravljen porabiti penija, da bi ga plačal. Vsi pravijo, da bi bilo lepo imeti les kot odprt prostor, vendar vsi mislijo, da je dolžnost nekoga drugega, da ga naredi. Islington Vestry je "rešila" to temo, vendar Islington Vestry ne ponuja niti centa za nakup. Ni težjega problema za skupnost ali posameznika, ki ga je treba rešiti, kot kako pridobiti posest nad lastnino drugih ljudi, ne da bi jo plačali.<br/><br/>Plačilo za to je bil res problem, saj je Churchyard Bottom Wood postal predmet intenzivne lokalne in nacionalne razprave. Skupni odbor je bil ustanovljen za zbiranje denarja za shranjevanje lesa. 20. novembra 1896, C.F. Cory-Wright, častni blagajnik, je pisal takratnemu dnevniku The Standard, v katerem je prosil za pomoč. Vse je spomnil na nevarnost izgube lesa in dejal, da ga je mogoče rešiti le z nakupom. Cerkveni komisarji bi prodali za 25.000 £ in dodatno (5.000 bi bilo potrebno za ograje in drenažo, kar skupaj 30.000 £. To je bilo preveč za Hornsey Council dvigniti, vendar so že glasovali 10.000 £ proti skupnemu. Gozdovi so bili neprecenljivi za ves severni London, zato je pozval javne organe in zasebne ljudi, naj zberejo preostalih 20.000 funtov. Opozoril je, da je sedanja ponudba cerkvenih komisarjev odprta šele do konca leta 1898. Nato so se gradbeniki preselili.<br/><br/>Pritožba je bila toplo sprejeta s strani tiska. Zasebni predlog zakona je bil hiti skozi parlament in Highgate Woods Zakon o ohranjanju, 1897, je postal zakon. Conunittee je zdaj imel pravico oglaševati prispevke za nakup lesa in ohranjanje.<br/><br/>Skoraj vsa sredstva so bila zbrana v dokaj kratkem času, vendar se je zadnjih nekaj tisoč izkazalo za zelo težko zbrati in rok za komisarje je bil le nekaj tednov. Cory-Wright je pisal, da je zahteval več časa, vendar mu je bilo odobreno le tri mesece, nato pa le, če so bile za dodatno obdobje plačane obresti v višini 4 % na celoten znesek. Na koncu je londonski okrožni svet, ki je prvotno ponudil 2.500 funtov, to naredil do 5.000 funtov in skupni znesek je bil dosežen, vendar je bila stvar blizu.<br/><br/>Svet se je odločil, da bo les preimenoval v "Queen's Woods" v čast diamantnega jubileja kraljice Viktorije, Hornsey pa je dal dober prikaz barv, ko je vojvodinja Albanyja uradno razglasila, da je les odprt "za brezplačno uporabo javnosti za vedno".<br/><br/>Medtem ko so kampanjo za reševanje Churchyard Bottom Wooda vodili in vodili lokalni ljudje, ki so strastno čutili do tega določenega koščka gozda, so prosili za pomoč in izkušnje velike mreže ljudi, od katerih so nekateri sodelovali pri podobnih kampanjah več kot trideset let. Odbor je izdal pritožbo, natisnjeno na zelo kakovostnem papirju in z nekaterimi znanimi imeni.<br/><br/>Vprašanja odprtega prostora in javnega zdravja so bili glavni predmeti viktorijanske vizije.<br/><br/>Gibanje odprtih prostorov<br/><br/>Octavia Hill, velika stanovanjska reformatorka, ki je začela s tremi starimi hišami v Maryleboneu, ki jo je kupil Jolm Ruskin, je hitro postala strokovnjakinja za nastanitev revnih ljudi v najbolj zdravih pogojih. Njen način je bil, da je kupila najeme in nato zrušila nekaj prenatrpanih hiš, da bi prinesla svetlobo in zrak ostalim, verjela, da sta svež zrak in sončna svetloba edini način, da se revni ljudje lahko rešijo pred gnilobo. To se je naučila kot otrok od svojega dedka Southwooda Smitha, ki je razvil svoje teorije v bolnišnici Fever v King's Crossu.<br/><br/>Zgradil je prva industrijska stanovanja za revne ljudi in statistično dokazal, da je dober zrak in dostojna drenaža rešila življenja. Gibson Gardens, v Northwold Road, je neposreden rezultat idej Southwooda Smitha. Več informacij o Gibson Gardens<br/><br/>Pomen odprtega zraka<br/><br/>Odprti prostori in priložnost za dihanje čistega zraka so bili bistvenega pomena za ljudi, ki živijo v eni ali dveh prenatrpanih sobah. Octavia Hill je prevzela svoje tožbe iz slumov Lisson Grove, navzgor Fitzjohn's Avenue do Hampstead Heath. Tako je ljubila Fitzjohn's Avenue polja, da jih je poskušala kupiti kot javni park. Stali so 10.000 £ in v treh tednih avgusta je bilo zbranih 8.500 £. Potrebno je bilo le konec poletnih počitnic in vrnitev s počitnic sočutnih prijateljev in nadaljnjih 1.500 funtov, vendar so lastniki nenadoma umaknili svojo ponudbo. Kljub vsem prošnjam so bila polja prekrita z velikimi hišami.<br/><br/>Iz tega se je razvila kampanja za reševanje Parlament Hilla, naslednjega odprtega prostora severno od Lisson Grovea, ki je kupil polja na poti graditeljev, da bi naredil stalni kordon sanitarni pred napredujočo opeko. Kampanja Parlament Hill Fields je bila tako uspešna, da je bil sprejet zakon Hampstead Heath in je bil denar od pritožbe. Iz tega denarja in spodbude za odprte prostore, je bilo razviti nacionalni sklad. Octavia Hill je bila več let zainteresirana za zaščito območij, kot je cerkveni gozd, zato je bila naravna zaveznica v boju za ohranitev gozda.<br/><br/>Tudi Commons Preservation Society je bil seznanjen s to vrsto agitacije in zbiranja denarja. Podrli so ograjo, ko so gospodarji dvorca zaprli koščke skupne zemlje, ki so vodili pravne in nezakonite bitke proti arogantni privatizaciji tradicionalno proste zemlje. Robert Hunter, njihov častni odvetnik iz leta 1868, se je vedno ukvarjal z zagotavljanjem odprtih prostorov, velikih ali majhnih, za javnost. On, zdaj sir Robert Hunter, je postal predsednik Cerkvenega spodnjega pritožbe. Predsednik društva za ohranjanje občin je bil gospod Shaw-Lefevre poslanec (pozneje Lord Eversley), ki je igral veliko vlogo v tej in drugih kampanjah v spodnjem domu. Octavia Hill je bil vključen v njihovo delo od približno 1875.<br/><br/>Hkrati se je Octavia Hill zavzemala za zakon o pokopavanju.<br/><br/>Mestna pokopališča so postala tako polna in tako resna nevarnost za zdravje, saj so onesnaževali vodnjake, iz katerih so ljudje črpali pitno vodo, da mestni pogrebi niso bili več dovoljeni. Namesto tega so bila na obrobju mesta ustvarjena pokopališča. Eno izmed njih je bilo pokopališče Abney Park, ki je bilo takrat gibanje za odstranitev nagrobnikov na robovih starih mestnih pokopališč, ponovno pokopavanje trupel drugje in preoblikovanje pokopališč v vrtove in odprte prostore, namesto da bi na njih gradili. To zemljišče v središču Londona je bilo zelo dragoceno in špekulanti so bili navdušeni nad tem, da bi ga dobili: celo Kvekerji so zgradili eno od svojih pokopališč in grozili, da bodo to spet storili z gradnjo nad Bunhill Fields. Octavia Hill je imela mrežo zaveznikov na ducatu področjih, zato je bila njena pomoč pri reševanju cerkvenega gozda neprecenljiva.<br/><br/>Metropolitan Gardens Society, ustanovljen leta 1882, je do leta 1890 postavil okoli dvesto majhnih vrtov v mestnih središčih. Kasneje so jih izročili lokalnim oblastem, tako da je bila njihova podpora za pritožbo Churchyard Bottom Wood od začetka zagotovljena.<br/><br/>Društvo Kyrle je zdaj pozabljeno, vendar je v svojih dneh imelo velik vpliv na urbanistično načrtovanje in zakonodajo o odprtem prostoru. Društvo je bilo ustanovljeno okoli leta 1875 za "Difuzijo lepote", da bi vneslo barve in zanimanje v življenje ljudi, ki živijo v dolgočasnem, temnem okolju. Svetle barve za stene in dekoracijo, dobro petje, odprti prostori, narava, književnost in umetnost. Vse to je spadalo v pristojnost Društva. Tam je bil okrasni oddelek, za katerega je William Morris predaval; glasbeni oddelek za promocijo zborov in veselih večerov za ljudi v lokalnih šolskih zgradbah; in literarni oddelek. Društvo je v pismih v The Timesu redno pozivalo k »bogatejšim razredom« za razdeljevanje knjig in revij v fantovske in dekliške klube, miloščine in drugod, vendar je bil Odbor za odprte prostore najbolj aktiven. Ime Kyrle izhaja iz papeževe knjige The Man of Ross, filantropa, ki je dal svoj rojstni kraj ljudem kot javni park. |
| With Thanksgiving around the corner, here are some festive file folder games we made for the girls. Both Thanksgiving games focus on math skills. And I'm grateful once again to my husband, Ed, for making all the clipart for me.<br/><br/>Thanksgiving Pattern Making<br/><br/>Like the name says, this game is about making patterns. Little ones just learning about patterns, can simply match the pictures onto the pattern strips, while others can continue the pattern with the picture cards on the blank strips.<br/><br/>To make the file folder, you want to cut out the grid of pictures to make the card pieces. I recommend laminating them to help them last longer. Then glue the pattern strips down on the file folder.<br/><br/>I wanted to have the blank pattern strips too so that the girls could see where to continue the pattern and how many to lay out. I attached them to the side of the folder using tape so that they could fold in to pack up the game and extend to layout the pattern.<br/><br/>I also added an extra blank one so that the girls could make their own pattern as well.<br/><br/>Turkey Number Game<br/><br/>In this game the girls add the feathers to the turkey body while practicing counting and number recognition. I used the colorless feathers to act as a guide for where to add the feathers and so that the girls could match the numbers. And be sure when gluing down the turkey body you only glue in the center so that the wing pieces can slide under the body.<br/><br/>Once all the feathers are laid out, we practice some simple arithmetic, such as taking away three feathers and seeing how many are left then adding two back to see what it equals.<br/><br/>In addition to black and white wings, we also included a colorless turkey in case you want to have the little ones color their own set. Instead of a file folder game you can turn this into a craft, coloring the pieces, cutting them out, and gluing them together.<br/><br/>Another option is to use the pieces to make a felt board story. We sometimes sing a turkey version of 10 Little Indians:<br/><br/>Like this:<br/><br/>Who Am I?<br/><br/>I think this is where I'm suppose to say something witty about myself. Oh well. I'm a stay-at-home mom to three awesome kids--our twin daughters who are seven now and a two-year-old son who is full of energy. In my pre-children life I was a teacher and I now homeschool our children. I'm also married to Ed, who is currently serving in the Air Force, and is the love of my life (it'd be awkward if he wasn't). Our family is big on books, crafts, and having fun together. I just thought I would share our activities in my own little corner of the internet.<br/><br/>Zoe appears to have it all--rich, handsome husband, easy New York life--but she made mistakes in her past and those mistakes are coming back up in her new life. I found myself on the edge of my seat for most of the book and was surprised...<br/><br/>I loved this book, I love the story, and I am grateful Margot Shetterly brought it to light. My only complaint was that I wished she discussed Katherine Johnson's role in the later missions a bit more but I guess the story had to end som...<br/><br/>I wanted to like this book and I did throughout most of it. Dana finds out her estranged husband and his girlfriend are found dead in the New Mexico desert. I was immediately drawn in by her character and the story. I really enjoyed seei... | Z zahvalnim dnem za vogalom, tukaj je nekaj prazničnih iger z datotekami, ki smo jih naredili za dekleta. Obe igri za zahvalni dan se osredotočata na matematične veščine. Še enkrat sem hvaležna svojemu možu Edu, da je naredil vse izrezke zame.<br/><br/>Zahvalni dan Vzorec Izdelava<br/><br/>Kot že ime pove, ta igra je o izdelavi vzorcev. Majhni, ki se učijo o vzorcih, se lahko preprosto ujemajo s slikami na vzorčnih trakovih, medtem ko lahko drugi nadaljujejo vzorec s slikovnimi karticami na praznih trakovih.<br/><br/>Če želite narediti mapo z datotekami, želite izrezati mrežo slik, da naredite koščke kartice. Priporočam, da jih laminirate, da jim pomagate trajati dlje. Nato lepite trakove vzorca navzdol na mapo z datotekami.<br/><br/>Želel sem imeti tudi prazne vzorčne trakove, da bi dekleta videla, kje naj nadaljujejo vzorec in koliko jih naj postavijo. S pomočjo traku sem jih pritrdil na stran mape, tako da so se lahko zložili, da so pakirali igro in razširili postavitev vzorca.<br/><br/>Dodala sem tudi dodatno prazno, da bi dekleta lahko naredila tudi svoj vzorec.<br/><br/>Turčija Številka igre<br/><br/>V tej igri dekleta dodate perje na purana telo, medtem ko vadite štetje in številko prepoznavanje. Sem uporabil brezbarvne perje, da deluje kot vodnik za kje dodati perje in tako, da dekleta lahko ujemajo številke. In se prepričajte, da pri lepljenju telesa purana lepite le v sredini, tako da lahko krila drsijo pod telesom.<br/><br/>Ko so vsa peresa položena, vadimo nekaj preproste aritmetike, kot je odstranjevanje treh peres in opazovanje, koliko jih je še ostalo, nato pa dodajanje dveh nazaj, da vidimo, kaj je enako.<br/><br/>Poleg črno-belih kril smo vključili tudi brezbarvno purana v primeru, da želite, da najmlajši barve svoj set. Namesto datoteke mape igro lahko spremenite to v obrt, barvanje kosov, jih izrežemo, in jih lepljenje skupaj.<br/><br/>Druga možnost je, da uporabimo kose, da naredimo zgodbo iz klobučevine. Včasih pojemo puransko različico 10 Little Indians:<br/><br/>Takole:<br/><br/>Kdo sem jaz?<br/><br/>Mislim, da sem tukaj, da povem nekaj duhovitega o sebi. Oh no. Sem domača mama za tri čudovite otroke - naše hčere dvojčice, ki so zdaj sedem in dvoletni sin, ki je poln energije. V svojem predšolskem življenju sem bila učiteljica in zdaj doma šolam najine otroke. Poročena sem tudi z Edom, ki trenutno služi v zračnih silah in je ljubezen mojega življenja (bi bilo nerodno, če ne bi bil). Naša družina je velika v knjigah, obrti in zabavi skupaj. Mislil sem, da bom naše dejavnosti delila v svojem majhnem kotičku interneta.<br/><br/>Zoe se zdi, da ima vse - bogat, čeden mož, lahko življenje v New Yorku - vendar je naredila napake v svoji preteklosti in te napake se vračajo v svojem novem življenju. Sem se znašel na robu svojega sedeža za večino knjige in je bil presenečen ...<br/><br/>Všeč mi je bila ta knjiga, všeč mi je zgodba in hvaležna sem, da jo je Margot Shetterly prinesla na svetlobo. Moja edina pritožba je bila, da sem želela, da bi malo bolj razpravljala o vlogi Katherine Johnson v kasnejših misijah, vendar mislim, da se je zgodba morala končati ...<br/><br/>Želela sem, da bi mi bila ta knjiga všeč in sem jo večinoma. Dana ugotovi, da sta njen odtujeni mož in njegovo dekle najdena mrtva v puščavi New Mexico. Takoj me je pritegnil njen lik in zgodba. Res sem užival v gledanju ... |
| Alcohol use by persons under age 21 has been identified as a major public health problem. Studies note that it increases the risks for disability, and may be detrimental to the developing brain. Minors who drink are more likely to commit suicide, break the law, or be victims of violence. Alcohol is implicated in nearly one-third of youth traffic fatalities. The total annual cost of underage drinking is estimated at $62 billion. While most laws intended to prevent underage drinking are passed at the state level, there has been legislative activity and interest at the federal level to support states' efforts to curb the problem. This report describes the extent of underage alcohol use, recent legislative activity on this issue, and various policy implications. It will be updated as new data become available. | Uporaba alkohola pri osebah, mlajših od 21 let, je bila opredeljena kot glavni problem javnega zdravja. Študije ugotavljajo, da povečuje tveganje za invalidnost in je lahko škodljiva za možgane v razvoju. Mladoletniki, ki pijejo, so bolj verjetno, da storijo samomor, kršijo zakon, ali so žrtve nasilja. Alkohol je vpleten v skoraj eno tretjino smrtnih žrtev v prometu mladih. Skupni letni stroški pitje mladoletnih ocenjuje na 62 milijard $. Medtem ko je večina zakonov, namenjenih preprečevanju mladoletnega pitja, sprejeta na državni ravni, je bila zakonodajna dejavnost in zanimanje na zvezni ravni za podporo prizadevanjem držav za omejitev problema. To poročilo opisuje obseg uporabe alkohola med mladoletniki, nedavno zakonodajno dejavnost na tem področju in različne posledice za politiko. Posodobljeno bo, ko bodo na voljo novi podatki. |
| Tag Archives: real food<br/><br/>Last week I wrote about the Nordic Food Manifesto, and how Denmark created a strong "real food" culture largely from an intentional effort led by Claus Meyer. It wasn't political lobbying or public petitioning that resulted in food reform, but rather a grassroots effort led by citizens with the power to actually implement and follow-through with change.<br/><br/>I ended the post alluding to one question: Why is it so hard for us to do this ourselves, as individuals? If an entire country can implement and spread a common view towards food, why can't we?<br/><br/>There's nothing really stopping us from mimicking Denmark's success. The problem is, we're inundated with so many messages about what we should be eating, and how we should be living, it's hard to know where to start. So rather than following successful frameworks that have been shown to work (like the Nordic Food Manifesto), most people jump from diet craze to diet craze, trying to find the "right way to eat."<br/><br/>But how did Claus Meyer succeed? What was the secret sauce that helped the Manifesto take hold? And is it reasonable to think we can apply those lessons to our own lives?

The unique outer crispiness of the meat gave way to a perfectly juicy interior, resulting in a sound more similar to slicing into a calzone than a ground beef patty.<br/><br/>We were sitting in Copenhagen's oldest pub, which felt more like a casual bistro than a bar, and I was about to try the dish recommended by our waitress/bar tender/proprietor?<br/><br/>"The Paris Beef, it's very good," she had said. "It's not from France… it's very Danish."<br/><br/>Sign me up!<br/><br/>Paris beef with fresh veggies and raw egg yolk at Rabes Have in Copenhagen | Tag Archives: prava hrana<br/><br/>Prejšnji teden sem pisal o Nordijskem prehrambenem manifestu in o tem, kako je Danska ustvarila močno kulturo "resnične hrane" v veliki meri iz namernega prizadevanja, ki ga je vodil Claus Meyer. Reforma hrane ni bila posledica političnega lobiranja ali javnih peticij, temveč prizadevanja državljanov, ki imajo moč, da dejansko izvajajo in sledijo spremembam.<br/><br/>Zaključil sem s sklicevanjem na eno vprašanje: zakaj je tako težko, da to storimo sami, kot posamezniki? Če lahko celotna država izvaja in širi skupni pogled na hrano, zakaj ne moremo?<br/><br/>Težava je v tem, da smo preplavljeni s toliko sporočili o tem, kaj bi morali jesti in kako bi morali živeti, da je težko vedeti, kje začeti. Namesto da bi sledili uspešnim okvirom, za katere se je izkazalo, da delujejo (kot je nordijski manifest hrane), večina ljudi skoči od diete do diete, ki poskuša najti "pravi način za prehranjevanje".<br/><br/>Toda kako je Claus Meyer uspel? Kaj je bila skrivna omaka, ki je pomagala Manifestu? In ali je smiselno misliti, da lahko te lekcije uporabimo v svojem življenju?
