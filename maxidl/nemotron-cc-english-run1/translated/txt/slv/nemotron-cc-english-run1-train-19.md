| Quidditch through the ages<br/><br/>I was doodling some quidditch-related objects like broomsticks and snitches and whatnot and it sort of turned into this odd compilation of things, including Harry down there at the bottom. I am not completely satisfied with the way it came out, but since it's not bad for my second Harry Potter fan-art picture, I decided to color it anyway. If you are wondering where his scar is, it's there, but it's very very light and small because I did that bit on the computer. Sketched in pen, colored in Paint. | Quidditch skozi stoletja<br/><br/>Preučeval sem nekaj predmetov, povezanih s kvizom, kot so metle, žvižgači in podobno, in to se je spremenilo v čudno zbirko stvari, vključno s Harryjem na dnu. Nisem povsem zadovoljna s tem, kako je izšla, vendar ker ni slabo za mojo drugo sliko Harry Potter, sem se odločila, da jo vseeno pobarvam. Če se sprašujete, kje je njegova brazgotina, je tam, vendar je zelo lahka in majhna, ker sem to naredil na računalniku. |
| I just started saltwater fly fishing this summer and I need a new reel, so it'll definitely be the Kraken. (I'm in Florida; we don't have those little trout minnow things around here. ) Private Message on the way to you.<br/><br/>I'm thrilled and flattered. I'm also trying to figure out a way to explain to She-Who-Must-Be-Obeyed that I'll need to buy a new rod worthy of this reel.....<br/><br/>I've always found that no explanation is the best explanation. Don't give her a reason to ever say you're not spontaneous enough. | To poletje sem začel loviti morske muhe in potrebujem nov valj, tako da bo zagotovo Kraken. (Sem na Floridi; tukaj nimamo tistih malih stvari s postrvi. ) Zasebno sporočilo na poti do vas.<br/><br/>Navdušen sem in počaščen. Prav tako poskušam ugotoviti, kako pojasniti She-Who-Must-Be-Obeyed, da bom moral kupiti novo palico, ki je vredna tega koluta.....<br/><br/>Vedno sem ugotovila, da je razlaga najboljša. –Ne daj ji razloga, da reče, da nisi dovolj spontana. |
| If you were admitted and enrolled --> yes If you were admitted and attended another school --> yes If you took extension courses (do they even have them there? I know UCLA does) --> yes If you went to graduate school there --> yes<br/><br/>That's my interpretation because any of these scenarios would fulfill either being "admitted to an undergraduate program" or "taking courses" at UC Berkeley. I could be completely wrong though, you're better off just calling them and clarifying your specific situation.<br/><br/>My opinion: Based on the wording, I interpreted it as asking if you were admitted to Berkeley undergrad, whether or not you chose to attend. If it meant admitted and attended, they could easily have seen that through the "Undergrad Institutions" portion of the application. | Če ste bili sprejeti in vpisani -> da Če ste bili sprejeti in obiskovali drugo šolo -> da Če ste vzeli podaljške (ali jih sploh imajo? Vem, da UCLA) -> da Če ste tam šli na podiplomsko šolo -> da<br/><br/>To je moja razlaga, ker bi kateri koli od teh scenarijev izpolnil bodisi "priznan v dodiplomski program" ali "vzemajo tečaje" na UC Berkeley. Mogoče se motim, ampak bolje, da jih pokličeš in pojasniš svojo situacijo.<br/><br/>Moje mnenje: Na podlagi besedila sem to razlagal tako, da sem vprašal, ali ste bili sprejeti na Berkeley undergrad, ali ste se odločili, da se udeležite. Če bi to pomenilo sprejem in udeležbo, bi to lahko zlahka videli skozi del vloge "Undergrad Institutions". |

| Winter Protection for Fig Trees<br/><br/>Report This Article<br/><br/>Winter Protection for Fig Trees<br/><br/>Overview<br/><br/>The fig tree has been around since at least 5,000 B.C., and is grown throughout the world for its delicious fruit. Figs grow well in a mild climate without weather extremes. The fig tree is now propagated in some areas with harsh winters. Protective precautions are required to save the tree from winter damage.<br/><br/>Potted Fig Trees<br/><br/>Ornamental fig trees in pots can stand some freezing and do not require light once they enter the winter dormancy phase. Avoid extreme swings in temperature by placing the fig tree in a controlled environment such as a garage, where temperatures range between slightly under freezing and slight above. The plant should be watered as the soil dries.<br/><br/>Shielding<br/><br/>Shielding to protect the tree from the most extreme winter weather is required. Fig trees require placement in soil areas where the soil does not freeze to protect it from disease and increase its chances of winter survival. Large screens placed around the tree protects it from winter winds that can damage and freeze the wood.<br/><br/>Wrapping<br/><br/>Tree wrapping protects the tree from cold weather and prevents hard winds from destroying the branches. Fig tree wrapping should be applied once the leaves from the tree have fallen to prevent leaves from rotting inside the wrapping material. Fig trees are sensitive to slight temperature changes. It can not warm up inside the protective film or else the tree may begin to grow, making it susceptible to severe damage during the cold snap.<br/><br/>Planting<br/><br/>Cultivar practices help to protect the fig tree during harsh winters. Varieties that are resistant to cold weather are best for locations where the weathers are harsh. Brown Turkey, Brunswick and Blue Celeste are good cultivars for cold weather. Planting should be done against a wall or structure that will radiate heat towards the tree during the winter months.<br/><br/>Snow<br/><br/>Roots of the fig tree require dry soil during the winter dormancy period. Watering should be done only when the soil is dry and the roots should be protected from melting snow and rain. Protection placed on the ground under the tree, near the trunk--to keep water from draining into the soil--protects the tree from damage.<br/><br/>Keywords:<br/>fig tree protection, fig tree winter, fig tree care | Zimska zaščita za smokve<br/><br/>Prijavi ta članek<br/><br/>Zimska zaščita za smokve<br/><br/>Povzetek<br/><br/>Smokva je bila približno od vsaj 5000 pred našim štetjem in se goji po vsem svetu za svoje okusno sadje. Smokve dobro rastejo v blagi klimi brez vremenskih ekstremov. Smokva se zdaj razmnožuje na nekaterih območjih z ostrimi zimami. Potrebni so zaščitni ukrepi za zaščito drevesa pred zimskimi poškodbami.<br/><br/>Potted Fig Drevesa<br/><br/>Okrasne smokve v lončkih lahko prenesejo nekaj zmrzovanja in ne potrebujejo svetlobe, ko vstopijo v fazo zimskega mirovanja. Izogibajte se ekstremnim nihanjem temperature tako, da postavite smokvo v nadzorovano okolje, kot je garaža, kjer se temperature gibljejo od nekoliko pod zmrzovanjem do rahlo nad njim. Rastlino je treba zalivati, ko se zemlja suši.<br/><br/>Zaščita<br/><br/>Za zaščito drevesa pred najbolj ekstremnim zimskim vremenom je potrebna zaščita. Smokve zahtevajo namestitev na območjih tal, kjer zemlja ne zamrzne, da bi jo zaščitili pred boleznimi in povečali možnosti za preživetje zime. Velike zavese, nameščene okoli drevesa, ga ščitijo pred zimskimi vetrovi, ki lahko poškodujejo in zamrznejo les.<br/><br/>Zavijanje<br/><br/>Zavijanje drevesa ščiti drevo pred hladnim vremenom in preprečuje, da bi močni vetrovi uničili veje. Zavijanje figovega drevesa je treba uporabiti, ko so listi iz drevesa padli, da se prepreči gnitje listov v materialu za zavijanje. Smokve so občutljive na majhne temperaturne spremembe. Ne more se segreti znotraj zaščitnega filma, sicer lahko drevo začne rasti, zaradi česar je dovzetno za hude poškodbe med mrazom.<br/><br/>Sajenje<br/><br/>Pridelovalne prakse pomagajo zaščititi smokve v ostrih zimah. Sorte, ki so odporne na hladno vreme, so najboljše za kraje, kjer so vremenske razmere ostre. Rjava Turčija, Brunswick in Blue Celeste so dobre sorte za hladno vreme. Sajenje je treba opraviti ob steni ali strukturi, ki bo v zimskih mesecih oddajala toploto proti drevesu.<br/><br/>Sneg<br/><br/>Korenine smokve zahtevajo suho zemljo v zimskem obdobju mirovanja. Zalivanje je treba opraviti le, ko je zemlja suha, korenine pa je treba zaščititi pred taljenjem snega in dežja. Zaščita, ki je nameščena na tleh pod drevesom, v bližini debla - da voda ne odteka v zemljo - ščiti drevo pred poškodbami.<br/><br/>Ključne besede:<br/>zaščita smokve, smokve zima, nega smokve |
| Oculus CEO comes down hard on Mac support for the Rift<br/><br/>Oculus CEO, Palmer Luckey, has not minced his words when asked in an interview whether the Rift VR headset will ever support the Mac. If you had any hopes of it being soon, you might want to ready yourselves for some disappointment.<br/><br/>That is up to Apple. If they ever release a good computer, we will do it.<br/><br/>What he's referring to there in a less diplomatic sense is the discrete graphics required to run the Rift. The simple truth is that Apple just doesn't go for high-end graphics that will meet the requirements for the headset. For context, on a Windows PC, you need a minimum of an NVIDIA GTX 970, a $300 graphics card.<br/><br/>As Luckey went on to say:<br/><br/>It just boils down to the fact that Apple doesn't prioritize high-end GPUs. You can buy a $6,000 Mac Pro with the top of the line AMD FirePro D700, and it still doesn't match our recommended specs. So if they prioritize higher-end GPUs like they used to for a while back in the day, we'd love to support Mac. But right now, there's just not a single machine out there that supports it.<br/><br/>The Mac Pro can't be accused of not packing plenty of horsepower, because it does, but equally FirePro graphics are targeted more towards the creative market, just like the Mac Pro. The Mac Pro in particular far exceeds other hardware requirements, but naturally as the Rift is graphics heavy, this is where the shortfall is. Luckey is perhaps being a little over the top, but equally he's the man behind the Rift, so there's no doubts plenty of truth to what he says. Even if he doesn't say it particularly well.<br/><br/>What say you, Mac owners of the world? Are you even bothered about the Oculus Rift or is it something you wish you could have? Sound off in the comments below!<br/><br/>Reader comments<br/><br/>Oculus CEO comes down hard on Mac support for the Rift<br/><br/>No, not bothered by it since I really wasn't planning on buying an Oculus Rift. For me the product category is still too early and too much in a beta-kinda phase. But he does rise a valid point. Apple should try to get more ahead of the pack CPU/GPU wise. Right now they're always trailing behind.<br/><br/>Excuse me, but what is HTC Vive better at? And Oculus Rift most certainly supports Linux machines that meet their hardware specifications! (The issue is not OS but hardware.)<br/><br/>Also, look at WHY the HTC Vive supports OS X: it includes more of its own hardware. (Which is why it costs so much.) The Oculus solutions - both the Rift and the Samsung Gear VR - require the hardware that it is plugging into to perform more of the heavy lifting.<br/><br/>VR isn't a gimmick. 3D TVs don't always give that much of a 3d effect, and it doesn't work with everyone. VR works with everyone, and the Oculus and HTC Vive official release products have almost no latency so there shoudn't be any motion sickness. There's also plenty of game support<br/><br/>Obviously if gaming is a priority you're generally not in the market for a Mac, though. Not many game developers support OSX so these types of devices likely have limited use on a Mac (for gaming, anyways, which the Rift was designed for). At least that's the only reason I could see myself using one. I definitely wouldn't use it for watching movies.<br/><br/>Apple did implement the Metal engine into El Capitan, there might be some plan to go into the gaming market (as Apple learned from iOS how big this market is, just look at the top grossing apps).<br/>So now the hardware is missing and and game devs would probably show some interest, since Macs there are now an acceptable amount of Mac users around the world.<br/><br/>I would like to see Apple make its way into that sector of the industry. I don't use any Apple products presently but they're making a lot of the right moves in many areas and I'm very intrigued.<br/><br/>Plus, competition fuels innovation. I know that major computer part manufactures already create that competition but Apple has the RnD willpower and the cash to really turn heads. They may not win the numbers games in terms of specs, they actually rarely do, but most people who care to do the research know that performance != the sum of the device's parts. Apple can do more with "less". On paper their products appear inferior but when carefully balanced hardware meets specifically engineered software they generally perform just as well as the competition if not out perform.<br/><br/>HA! I love how, all of a sudden, having a high performance computer is not important to Apple phans! There is not a single Mac capable of the highest end graphics. Can't buy one, can't build one. Mac is not capable of being the highest in performance and you are good with that. HA! Classic!<br/><br/>I bought my MacBook Pro Retina in 2012 because of the high resolution screen and the non-discrete GPU. However, for my desktop I built a system with a 4K monitor, i7 4790K CPU, 3 GTX 970 GPU's, and 16 gb of memory all for less than what I'd pay for an iMac. I even have an SSD set up to boot in OSX. My point is Apple could do similar things if it wished, but doesn't. In fact, look at the most recent iMac. It includes discrete graphics and a slow 5400 RPM drive. My computer may not look as pretty, and it's not as thin, but in the end it's more useful - isn't that why we buy a computer in the first place?<br/><br/>I don't see why a Mac pro can not make use of the Oculus isn't it built for rendering video. I understand that it will not be able to run on iMac's and because of this the Oculus should be branded for Pro users due to the requirements and come at the price.<br/><br/>Now people are saying that your computer is doing ALL the heavy lifting, so why is the price point over $800 for something that isn't doing anything?<br/><br/>I'm excited about the direction of VR but not where it is at the moment.<br/><br/>Your display (which the Rift is) never does any of the heavy lifting. It's $800 because of what the display does; 110° viewing angle (still not human eye but much closer than other displays) with super low latency to reduce or eliminate motion sickness on a 1200x1800 per eye display for HD quality.<br/><br/>And yes, Mac's are very widely used for video rendering, but that rendering doesn't happen at 30+fps. It can take video rendering machines hours to render a single frame and sometimes years to render an entire movie. The final products, or pre-rendered material, is what then becomes 30+fps.<br/><br/>Thank you @TheRealFixxer<br/>Alot of what you say makes sense and some I was unaware of.<br/><br/>I guess I don't see VR as a game, but as an immersion and seeing Mac's are good at 3dcad and compiling video I would think they would be able to compile a scene well. I've even seen 3d renders of movie walk through. Creating a 3d world and placing cameras in areas to figure out how a scene would look<br/><br/>But I agree Mac's make more use of CPU cycles even by using there GPU's to help. WIth that said there are other directions one could take it. Like external thunderbolt video cards.<br/><br/>My big grip is the fact Octulas is looked at as a consumer product. If the requirements are that high, then it's more a pro product and needs to be advertized as that. I understand the technology is there but don't feel it's there to call it a consumer product.<br/><br/>Yes, you are right. Apple also has issues with software. Most aren't using "metal" the apple programming language which speeds up the processing for games because it's an Apple only solution where many use game engines that work on Microsoft Direct X or open source Opengl which most games use to run on Linux and oSX. Opengl is around 20% slower and sometime a lot more than that compared to direct x so a top of the line gaming card running in oSX runs as fast is a mid level gaming card in windows. So big problems not to mention most macs have built in cards that have no upgradability.<br/><br/>The mac pro is so different that Apple would have to do this as it wouldn't be worth a card vendor doing this as there is no profit in it for them with the small amount of possible buyers there would be for this. Apple doesn't like to loose money so I don't see this ever happening. Apple would loose money offering video card upgrades for mac pros.<br/><br/>Well he has a point though I do t care about oculus rift, rather wait for starVR. There should be an option to add better GPUs into an iMac and MacBook Pro. It is also sad that there is no more nVidia card, I liked the CUDA support now I will have to buy a PC and install Linux for my CUDA projects.<br/><br/>Gaming is a growing market and it won't be long until even iPhones have more GPU performance than the Macs. I agree that Apple should offer a high end GPU in a Mac<br/><br/>I am very bothered by the lack of high performance discrete graphics on Mac computers. Even the top of the like iMac uses an out of date mobile GPU which, of course, cannot be upgraded. If I want to develop software for VR, Apple has left me no choice but to buy or build a PC to run it on. As a big Apple fan (yes I admit it) this make me rather sad.<br/><br/>BTW, VR is not some passing fad. If you have tried it you know what I mean. VR is going to change gaming and content creation forever. My only worry about VR is that is too good. There could be millions of people that will become addicted to living and playing in virtual worlds. Look at how many people got addicted to MMOs that played on a flat screen. With VR you really feel like you are in the game.<br/><br/>Not worried about anything, i am pretty sure apple will have its own implementation for Mac and iOS when tech will be ready for consumers, right now it is more for hardcore users. Like always apple like to time its presence on right time, with right product. Have faith in apple.<br/><br/>It's funny that a lot of people know which vr is better based on os support. I guess you guys did heavy testing and now are the guy in the big electronic store that knows best.<br/><br/>HTC said it will bring support to the osx but that still needs to be seen.<br/><br/>I understand that a lot of you guys are stamped on there d**ks. But understand that Apple is more focused on laptops. And laptops can't be packed with more power than a PC, due to size, heat, power consumption etc.<br/><br/>He is right, even though he put it in **** terms. I love my Mac but Lord it needs a boost in graphics. Not that it needs to cost more but I would be more than willing to pay a little extra for a better graphics card or at least have the option to install my own. It's really too bad this guy had to make his statement sound like he is just plain uneducated. | Oculus CEO prihaja težko na Mac podporo za Rift<br/><br/>Oculus CEO, Palmer Luckey, ni zmešal svojih besed, ko so ga v intervjuju vprašali, ali bo slušalka Rift VR kdaj podprla Mac. Če ste imeli upanje, da bo kmalu, se boste morda želeli pripraviti na nekaj razočaranja.<br/><br/>To je odvisno od Applea. Če bodo kdaj izdali dober računalnik, bomo to storili.<br/><br/>Kar misli tam v manj diplomatskem smislu je diskretna grafika, potrebna za zagon Rifta. Preprosta resnica je, da Apple preprosto ne gre za vrhunsko grafiko, ki bo ustrezala zahtevam za slušalke. Za kontekst, na računalniku s sistemom Windows, potrebujete vsaj NVIDIA GTX 970, grafično kartico za 300 dolarjev.<br/><br/>Kot je rekel Luckey:<br/><br/>Preprosto se spušča v dejstvo, da Apple ne daje prednost vrhunskim grafičnim procesorjem. Lahko kupite $ 6,000 Mac Pro z vrhom linije AMD FirePro D700 in še vedno ne ustreza našim priporočenim specifikacijam. Torej, če dajejo prednost višjim grafičnim procesorjem, kot so nekoč, bi radi podprli Mac. Toda trenutno ni nobenega stroja, ki bi ga podpiral.<br/><br/>Mac Pro ni mogoče obtožiti, da ne pakira veliko konjske moči, ker to počne, vendar je enako FirePro grafika bolj usmerjena na ustvarjalni trg, tako kot Mac Pro. Mac Pro še posebej daleč presega druge zahteve strojne opreme, vendar seveda, kot je Rift je grafika težka, to je, kjer je primanjkljaj. Luckey je morda malce nad vrhom, vendar je prav tako človek za razpoko, tako da ni dvoma, da je veliko resnice v tem, kar pravi, tudi če tega ne pove posebej dobro.<br/><br/>Kaj pravite, Mac lastniki sveta? Ali ste sploh zaskrbljeni zaradi Oculus Rift ali je to nekaj, kar si želite, da bi lahko imeli? Zvok off v komentarjih spodaj!<br/><br/>Komentarji bralcev<br/><br/>Oculus CEO prihaja težko na Mac podporo za Rift<br/><br/>Ne, ne moti ga, ker res nisem načrtoval nakupa Oculus Rift. Zame je kategorija izdelkov še vedno prezgodaj in preveč v fazi beta-kinda. Ampak on se dvigne veljavno točko. Apple bi moral poskusiti, da bi dobili več pred paketom CPU / GPU pametno. Zdaj vedno zaostajajo.<br/><br/>Oprostite, ampak kaj je HTC Vive boljši? In Oculus Rift zagotovo podpira Linux stroje, ki ustrezajo njihovim specifikacijam strojne opreme! (Vprašanje ni OS, ampak strojna oprema.)<br/><br/>Prav tako si oglejte, zakaj HTC Vive podpira OS X: vključuje več lastne strojne opreme. (Zato stane toliko.) Rešitve Oculus - tako Rift kot Samsung Gear VR - zahtevajo strojno opremo, ki jo priključuje, da izvede več težkega dviganja.<br/><br/>VR ni trik. 3D televizorji ne dajejo vedno toliko 3d učinka in ne deluje z vsemi. VR deluje z vsemi, izdelki Oculus in HTC Vive pa nimajo skoraj nobene zamude, zato ne bo nobene bolezni gibanja. Obstaja tudi veliko podpore za igro<br/><br/>Očitno je, da če je igranje prednostna naloga, na splošno niste na trgu za Mac. Ni veliko razvijalcev iger podpira OSX, zato imajo te vrste naprav verjetno omejeno uporabo na Macu (za igre, tako ali tako, za katere je bil zasnovan Rift). Vsaj to je edini razlog, da se vidim, kako ga uporabljam. –Zagotovo ga ne bi uporabljal za gledanje filmov.<br/><br/>Apple je implementiral kovinski motor v El Capitan, morda bi obstajal načrt, da bi šel na trg iger na srečo (kot je Apple izvedel iz iOS-a, kako velik je ta trg, samo poglejte na vrhunske aplikacije).<br/>Torej zdaj manjka strojna oprema in razvijalci iger bi verjetno pokazali nekaj zanimanja, saj so Maci zdaj sprejemljiva količina uporabnikov Mac po vsem svetu.<br/><br/>Želim si, da bi Apple prišel v ta sektor industrije. Trenutno ne uporabljam nobenih izdelkov Apple, vendar na mnogih področjih delajo veliko pravih potez in zelo me zanima.<br/><br/>Poleg tega konkurenca spodbuja inovacije. Vem, da glavni računalniški proizvajalci že ustvarjajo to konkurenco, vendar ima Apple moč volje RnD in denar, da resnično obrne glave. Morda ne bodo zmagali številke iger v smislu specifikacij, pravzaprav redko, vendar večina ljudi, ki skrbijo za raziskavo, ve, da je zmogljivost ! = vsota delov naprave. Apple lahko naredi več z "manj". Na papirju se njihovi izdelki zdijo slabši, ko pa skrbno uravnotežena strojna oprema izpolnjuje posebej zasnovano programsko opremo, na splošno delujejo enako dobro kot konkurenca, če ne delujejo zunaj.<br/><br/>HA! Všeč mi je, kako nenadoma, ki imajo visoko zmogljiv računalnik ni pomembno, da Apple phans! Ni en Mac sposoben najvišje končne grafike. Ne more kupiti enega, ne more zgraditi enega. Mac ni sposoben biti najvišji v zmogljivosti in ste dobri s tem. HA! Classic!<br/><br/>MacBook Pro Retina sem kupil leta 2012 zaradi zaslona z visoko ločljivostjo in nediskretnega grafičnega procesorja. Vendar pa sem za svojo namizje zgradil sistem z monitorjem 4K, i7 4790K CPU, 3 GTX 970 GPU in 16 GB pomnilnika za manj, kot bi plačal za iMac. Imam celo SSD nastavljen za zagon v OSX. Moja točka je, da bi Apple lahko storil podobne stvari, če bi želel, vendar ne. Pravzaprav si oglejte najnovejši iMac. Vključuje diskretno grafiko in počasen pogon 5400 RPM. Moj računalnik morda ni videti tako lep in ni tako tanek, vendar je na koncu bolj uporaben - ali ni to razlog, zakaj kupujemo računalnik na prvem mestu?<br/><br/>Ne vidim, zakaj Mac Pro ne more izkoristiti Oculus ni zgrajena za upodabljanje videa. Razumem, da ne bo mogel teči na iMac in zaradi tega je treba Oculus blagovno znamko za Pro uporabnike zaradi zahtev in pridejo na ceno.<br/><br/>Zdaj ljudje pravijo, da vaš računalnik počne vse težke dvige, zakaj je cena nad 800 dolarjev za nekaj, kar ne počne ničesar?<br/><br/>Navdušen sem nad smerjo VR-ja, vendar ne tam, kjer je trenutno.<br/><br/>Vaš zaslon (ki je razpoka) nikoli ne naredi nobenega težkega dviganja. To je 800 dolarjev zaradi tega, kar zaslon počne; kot gledanja 110° (še vedno ne človeško oko, vendar veliko bližje kot drugi zasloni) z zelo nizko zakasnitvijo, da se zmanjša ali odpravi bolezen gibanja na zaslonu 1200x1800 na oko za kakovost HD.<br/><br/>In da, Maci se zelo pogosto uporabljajo za upodabljanje videoposnetkov, vendar se to upodabljanje ne zgodi pri 30 + sličicah na sekundo. Stroji za upodabljanje videoposnetkov lahko trajajo ure, da upodabljajo en okvir in včasih leta, da upodabljajo celoten film. Končni izdelki ali preddobavljeni material je tisto, kar nato postane 30 + sličic na sekundo.<br/><br/>Hvala @TheRealFixxer<br/>Veliko tega, kar si rekel, je smiselno in nekaj, česar nisem vedel.<br/><br/>Mislim, da ne vidim VR kot igro, ampak kot potopitev in gledanje Mac je dobro na 3dcad in kompilacijo video bi mislil, da bi lahko zbrali sceno dobro. Videl sem celo 3d upodabljanje filma sprehod skozi. Ustvarjanje 3D-sveta in postavitev kamer na območjih, da bi ugotovili, kako bi prizor izgledal<br/><br/>Vendar se strinjam, da Mac bolj izkoristi cikle CPU, tudi z uporabo tam GPU-jev za pomoč. WIth, ki je dejal, da obstajajo druge smeri, ki bi jih lahko vzeli. Kot zunanje grafične kartice Thunderbolt.<br/><br/>Moj velik oprijem je dejstvo, da se Octulas obravnava kot potrošniški izdelek. Če so zahteve tako visoke, potem je bolj profesionalen izdelek in ga je treba oglaševati kot to. Razumem, da je tehnologija tam, vendar ne čutim, da je tam, da bi jo poimenovali potrošniški izdelek.<br/><br/>Ja, prav imate. Apple ima tudi težave s programsko opremo. Večina ne uporablja "kovinskega" programskega jezika Apple, ki pospešuje obdelavo iger, ker je to rešitev Apple, kjer mnogi uporabljajo igralne motorje, ki delujejo na Microsoft Direct X ali Opengl, ki jih večina iger uporablja za delovanje na Linuxu in oSX. Opengl je približno 20% počasnejši in včasih veliko več kot neposredno x, tako da je vrh igralne kartice, ki teče v oSX, hiter, kot je igralna kartica srednjega nivoja v oknih. Tako velike težave, da ne omenjam, da je večina Macov vgrajena v kartice, ki nimajo nadgradljivosti.<br/><br/>Mac Pro je tako drugačen, da bi Apple moral to storiti, saj ne bi bilo vredno prodajalca kartic, saj v njem ni dobička za njih z majhno količino možnih kupcev, ki bi bili za to. Apple ne mara izgubljati denarja, zato ne vidim, da se to kdaj zgodi. Apple bi izgubil denar, ki ponuja nadgradnje grafičnih kartic za mac profesionalce.<br/><br/>No, ima točko, čeprav mi ni mar za oculus rift, raje počakajte na starVR. Obstajati mora možnost za dodajanje boljših grafičnih procesorjev v iMac in MacBook Pro. Žalostno je tudi, da ni več kartice nVidia, všeč mi je podpora CUDA, zdaj bom moral kupiti računalnik in namestiti Linux za svoje projekte CUDA.<br/><br/>Igre na srečo je rastoči trg in ne bo dolgo, dokler tudi iPhones imajo večjo zmogljivost GPU kot Macs. Strinjam se, da bi moral Apple ponuditi high-end GPU v Mac<br/><br/>Zelo me moti pomanjkanje visoko zmogljive diskretne grafike na računalnikih Mac. Tudi vrh, kot je iMac, uporablja zastarel mobilni GPU, ki ga seveda ni mogoče nadgraditi. Če želim razviti programsko opremo za VR, mi Apple ni pustil druge izbire, kot da kupim ali zgradim računalnik, da bi ga zagnal. Kot velik oboževalec Apple (da, priznam) me to precej žalosti.<br/><br/>BTW, VR ni nekakšna prehodna moda. Če ste jo poskusili, veste, kaj mislim. VR bo za vedno spremenil igranje in ustvarjanje vsebin. Moja edina skrb za VR je, da je preveč dobra. Obstajajo lahko milijoni ljudi, ki bodo postali odvisni od življenja in igranja v virtualnih svetovih. Oglejte si, koliko ljudi je postalo odvisnih od MMO-jev, ki so igrali na ravnem zaslonu. Z VR se resnično počutite, kot da ste v igri.<br/><br/>Ne skrbi za nič, sem precej prepričan, da bo Apple imel svojo implementacijo za Mac in iOS, ko bo tehnologija pripravljena za potrošnike, zdaj je bolj za hardcore uporabnike. Kot vedno, jabolko želi pravočasno upočasniti svojo prisotnost s pravim izdelkom. Verjemite v jabolko.<br/><br/>Smešno je, da veliko ljudi ve, kateri vr je boljši na podlagi podpore OS. Domnevam, da ste naredili težke teste in zdaj ste fant v veliki elektronski trgovini, ki ve najbolje.<br/><br/>HTC je dejal, da bo prinesel podporo za osx, vendar je še vedno treba videti.<br/><br/>Razumem, da je veliko od vas tam d**ks. Ampak razumem, da je Apple bolj osredotočen na prenosnike. In prenosniki ne morejo biti pakirani z več moči kot osebni računalnik, zaradi velikosti, toplote, porabe energije itd.<br/><br/>Prav ima, čeprav je to dal v **** pogojih. Ljubim svoj Mac, vendar Gospod potrebuje spodbudo v grafiko. Ne, da bi moralo staneti več, vendar bi bil več kot pripravljen plačati malo več za boljšo grafično kartico ali vsaj imeti možnost namestitve lastne. Res je slabo, da je moral ta fant narediti svojo izjavo, kot da je preprosto neizobražen. |
| The Masjid in the American Landscape: Civic Rights<br/><br/>Twelfth graders examine and explain legal rights designed to protect religious liberty. They evaluate the extent to which the First Amendment protects religious practices. They research and describe current and past legal battles over religious zoning and buildings. They discuss whether restrictions should be placed on where religious buildings are built.<br/><br/>What Members Say<br/><br/>As an online high school teacher, LP has helped me tremendously with extra resources! I have been able to use additional supplemental materials from here and students are able to gain more knowledge and a different perspective. | Masjid v ameriški krajini: državljanske pravice<br/><br/>Dvanajsti razredi preučujejo in pojasnjujejo zakonske pravice, namenjene zaščiti verske svobode. Ocenjujejo, v kolikšni meri Prvi amandma ščiti verske prakse. Raziskujejo in opisujejo sedanje in pretekle pravne bitke glede verskih območij in zgradb ter razpravljajo o tem, ali bi bilo treba omejiti, kje se gradijo verske zgradbe.<br/><br/>Kaj pravijo poslanci<br/><br/>Kot spletni učitelj na srednji šoli mi je LP ogromno pomagal z dodatnimi viri!

| What Guys Said 19<br/><br/>No, it is because entertainment producers and product marketers want actors/actresses and models who look like the majority of the audience, so that they are relatable and therefore more effective sales tools. I am sure that Asian women look wonderful to Asian men. To me, as a white man, they have zero appeal.<br/><br/>@cowboy101 I am 100 per cent straight. I do not go outside of my race. When I was a soldier I had the "me love you long time" experience in Asia. That has left me feeling uncomfortable whenever there are Asian females near me. Sometimes I become profoundly uncomfortable, even though the particular individuals have done nothing to merit it. During a visit to Thailand, I found that the only way to prevent myself being propositioned on the street was to take white a female with me as a minder.<br/><br/>Aha the thing is that there isn't many white people (or any at all) in China, but in 'white' places, (or at least Australia) there are quite a lot of Asians around there, which made me think about this question...<br/><br/>Maybe in parts of the country where you stick at (remember, birds of a feather...), just like to republicans it seems that most people are republican etc. While it can only be small minority that you are surrounded by.<br/><br/>And as far as I know, there are a lot of whites in china, mainly by business, etc. But it's simple, most of people there are Asian, so they prefere Asian girls (dogs like dogs , cats like cats, most people prefere their own kind). And there is nothing wrong with that. Same is in white countries.<br/><br/>I think Asians are the most beautful. Unfortunately for me the 2 I got involved with in my life one was using me for my place/internet a long time ago and the recent one was a gold digging stupid bitch. She never graduated college and was 30. I would be extremely happy if I met a smart cute Asian woman near my age that was not a gold digger.<br/><br/>@Prettyapathetic yes because when a man loves deeply he always good with you on bed no matter size of tits or colour of skin and a real man always respect a girl in every relation like mother, sister, wife, girlfriend etc<br/><br/>as a model from childhood I got my start with a company called sugar & spice. I was recruited in Japan while my family was stationed there.<br/><br/>you get a job because they are going for a certain look, who are they targeting, and the area you live in.<br/><br/>I had to leave the industry last year because of health reasons. I worked with with many types of people, korean, Japanese, chinese, polish, german, American, Spanish, arabic. I've worked with children, adults, teenagers all of these ethnicities.<br/><br/>I am half white half Native American (Lakota) so they loved my look from a young age. but there are many beauty standards in the industry and not all of them are as portrayed, some being made to look worse, and some not taken seriously enough...<br/><br/>Nope, it's because the Asian men are jealous and angry and invent thousands of excuses every rare time who have Asian women in the media because they are jealous of Asian women, and Americans want to keep the status of white women, this is why the couples between Asian women and white men are boycotted and all other race with white women are pushed, it's white women wiht white men and white women with other races in American media, since it's opression and offensive for the ego of men of other race the women of own race with white but white women with other race is "anti-racism". You need to understand the American political social engineering all over these years of media, democrats, politics and propaganda.<br/><br/>Anyway, in countries like china, japan, korea they have Asian men and Asian women only and the only exceptions are when they import a white women to make some fantasy scene for them but it's not so much, it's forbiden expose the hatred and jealousy of some Asian men.<br/><br/>The Asian boys will be happy if you say something against other men, but they will be angry if you say that the Asian girl will die for the blond girl date the handsome caucasian/white dude, they will try to force Asian women to make anything against these men to these small vocal group of Asian men feel better in their hatred, excuses, racism and jealousy. This is why Asian women is not showed so much, it's because the Asian men will be angry, it's because the white women can't be replaced, and the American propaganda is around white women with white men, white women with other race, white women against white men for the other race of men, white women in everything.<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>1&#124;0<br/><br/>0&#124;0<br/><br/>Opinion Owner<br/><br/>1mo<br/><br/>All the excuses of media and propaganda and all lies for racism, jealousy and hate aren't used against white women by the same men who invent the excuses, white women all the time in the media, understand, the American social engineering is made by democrats, democrats hate white men, and the most popular couples would be white men and Asian women but it's horrible for a few group of white racists who are racists even against Asians, is bad for the angry Asian men and their excuses, is bad for the white women, the democrats really don't like white men and work hard to try to make the couple and anything wiht white men and non-white women be related to bad things while pushing white women and non-white men. It's a American political problem.<br/><br/>I think it's a opression against the ego of the men of other race, so the white guys need to look bad, be some sort of jokes, be soft, while the scenes with white women and other race is the opposite of the scenes of white men and non-white women | Kaj pravijo moški 19<br/><br/>Ne, to je zato, ker proizvajalci zabave in tržniki izdelkov želijo igralce / igralke in modele, ki izgledajo kot večina občinstva, tako da so relativna in zato učinkovitejša prodajna orodja. Prepričan sem, da azijske ženske izgledajo čudovito za azijske moške. Zame, kot belega moškega, nimajo nobene privlačnosti.<br/><br/>@cowboy101 Jaz sem 100 odstotkov naravnost. Ne grem izven moje rase. Ko sem bil vojak sem imel "me love you dolgo časa" izkušnje v Aziji. To me je pustilo neprijetno, ko so azijske ženske blizu mene. Včasih mi postane zelo neprijetno, čeprav posamezni posamezniki niso storili ničesar, da bi si to zaslužili. Med obiskom na Tajskem sem ugotovil, da je edini način, da se izognem temu, da bi me predlagali na ulici, vzel belo žensko s seboj kot skrbnico.<br/><br/>Aha, stvar je v tem, da na Kitajskem ni veliko belcev (ali sploh nobenih), toda v "belih" krajih (ali vsaj v Avstraliji) je tam precej Azijcev, kar me je navedlo na to vprašanje ...<br/><br/>Morda v delih države, kjer se držite (se spomnite, ptice perja ...), tako kot republikancem se zdi, da je večina ljudi republikanci itd. Medtem ko je lahko le majhna manjšina, s katero ste obkroženi.<br/><br/>In kolikor vem, na Kitajskem je veliko belcev, predvsem posel itd. Toda preprosto je, večina ljudi je Azijcev, zato raje azijska dekleta (psi kot psi , mačke kot mačke, večina ljudi raje svojo vrsto). In nič ni narobe s tem. Enako je v belih državah.<br/><br/>Mislim, da so Azijci najlepši. Na žalost zame 2, s katerim sem se vključil v mojem življenju, me je ena že dolgo uporabljala za mojo hišo / internet, nedavna pa je bila neumna kurba, ki je kopala zlato. Nikoli ni diplomirala na kolidžu in je bila 30. Zelo bi bil srečen, če bi srečal pametno srčkano azijsko žensko v mojih letih, ki ni bila zlati kopalec.<br/><br/>@Prettyapathetic ja, ker ko človek globoko ljubi, je vedno dober z vami v postelji, ne glede na velikost jošk ali barvo kože in pravi moški vedno spoštuje dekle v vsakem odnosu, kot so mati, sestra, žena, dekle itd<br/><br/>Kot manekenka iz otroštva sem začela s podjetjem Sugar & Spice. Zaposlili so me na Japonskem, medtem ko je bila tam moja družina.<br/><br/>dobiš službo, ker gredo za določen videz, koga ciljajo in območje, v katerem živiš.<br/><br/>Lani sem moral zapustiti industrijo zaradi zdravstvenih razlogov. Delal sem z mnogimi vrstami ljudi, Korejci, Japonci, Kitajci, Poljski, Nemci, Američani, Španci, Arabci. Delal sem z otroki, odraslimi, najstniki vseh teh etničnih skupin.<br/><br/>Sem pol bela pol Indijanec (Lakota), tako da so ljubili moj videz od mladih let. vendar obstaja veliko lepotnih standardov v industriji in niso vsi tako upodobljeni, nekateri so videti slabše, nekateri pa ne jemljejo dovolj resno...<br/><br/>Ne, to je zato, ker so azijski moški ljubosumni in jezni in izumljajo na tisoče izgovorov vsakič, ko imajo azijske ženske v medijih, ker so ljubosumne na azijske ženske, in Američani želijo ohraniti status belih žensk, zato so pari med azijskimi ženskami in belimi moškimi bojkotirani in vse druge rase z belimi ženskami. Morate razumeti ameriški politični socialni inženiring v vseh teh letih medijev, demokratov, politike in propagande.<br/><br/>Kakorkoli že, v državah, kot so Kitajska, Japonska, Koreja, imajo samo azijski moški in azijske ženske in edine izjeme so, ko uvozijo bele ženske, da bi nekaj fantazijsko sceno za njih, vendar to ni toliko, da je prepovedano razkriti sovraštvo in ljubosumje nekaterih azijskih moških.<br/><br/>Azijski fantje bodo srečni, če boste rekli nekaj proti drugim moškim, vendar bodo jezni, če boste rekli, da bo azijsko dekle umrlo za blond dekle datum čeden kavkaški / beli tip, bodo poskušali prisiliti azijske ženske, da naredijo kaj proti tem moškim, da se ti majhni vokalni skupini azijskih moških počutijo bolje v svojem sovraštvu, izgovorih, rasizmu in ljubo. Zato azijske ženske niso prikazane toliko, to je zato, ker bodo azijski moški jezni, to je zato, ker belih žensk ni mogoče zamenjati, in ameriška propaganda je okoli belih žensk z belimi moškimi, bele ženske z drugo raso, bele ženske proti belim moškim za drugo raso moških, bele ženske v vsem.<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>1&#124;0<br/><br/>0&#124;0<br/><br/>Mnenje lastnika<br/><br/>1 mesec<br/><br/>Vse izgovore medijev in propagande in vse laži za rasizem, ljubosumje in sovraštvo ne uporabljajo proti belim ženskam isti moški, ki si izmišljajo izgovore, bele ženske ves čas v medijih, razumete, ameriški socialni inženiring naredijo demokrati, demokrati sovražijo bele moške in najbolj priljubljeni pari bi bili beli moški in azijske ženske, vendar je grozno za nekaj belih rasistov in belih za slabih moških. Gre za ameriški politični problem.<br/><br/>Mislim, da je to zatiranje ega moških druge rase, zato morajo beli fantje izgledati slabo, biti nekakšne šale, biti mehki, medtem ko so prizori z belimi ženskami in drugimi rasami nasprotni prizorom belih moških in nebelih žensk. |
