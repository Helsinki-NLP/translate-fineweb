| Concussion: Using Cooling Helmets to Combat Brain Injuries in College Football<br/><br/>Former football player Kevin Jackson uses brain cooling technology in the hopes of reducing the effects of traumatic brain injuries and sports-related concussions.<br/>Jackson was a running back for the University of Illinois from 1990-1994. In addition to suffering a number of injuries to his body during his playing days, Jackson also suffered a number of un-diagnosed concussions. Now a research scientist and injury spotter, Jackson uses his experience as a player to help him understand and combat brain trauma in sports.<br/>This video illustrates the chain of events that occur when a traumatic brain injury happens, explores how concussion symptoms very from person to person, highlights the need to protect oneself from repeated head traumas, and shows how using cooling technologies might aide in recovery from injury.<br/>To learn more about this research, please visit...<br/> | Pretres možganov: Uporaba hladilnih čelad za boj proti poškodbam možganov v kolidžnem nogometu<br/><br/>Nekdanji nogometaš Kevin Jackson uporablja tehnologijo hlajenja možganov v upanju, da bo zmanjšal učinke travmatičnih poškodb možganov in pretresov, povezanih s športom.<br/>Jackson je tekel nazaj za Univerzo v Illinoisu od 1990-1994. Poleg tega, da je utrpel številne poškodbe telesa med njegovimi dnevi igranja, je Jackson utrpel tudi številne nediagnosticirane pretrese možganov. Zdaj je raziskovalec in opazovalec poškodb, Jackson pa uporablja svoje izkušnje kot igralec, da bi mu pomagal razumeti in se boriti proti poškodbam možganov v športu.<br/>Ta videoposnetek prikazuje verigo dogodkov, ki se pojavijo, ko se zgodi travmatična poškodba možganov, raziskuje, kako simptomi pretresa možganov zelo od osebe do osebe, poudarja potrebo po zaščiti pred ponavljajočimi se poškodbami glave in prikazuje, kako lahko uporaba tehnologij hlajenja pomaga pri okrevanju po poškodbi.<br/>Če želite izvedeti več o tej raziskavi, obiščite... |
| Massage Therapy<br/><br/>Massage is perhaps one of the oldest healing traditions. Many ancient peoples – including the Ancient Greeks, Egyptians, Chinese and Indians – were convinced of the therapeutic properties of massage and used it to treat a variety of ailments.<br/><br/>Massage therapy is the practice of kneading or manipulating a person's muscles and other soft-tissue in order to improve their wellbeing or health. It is a form of manual therapy that includes holding, moving, and applying pressure to the muscles, tendons, ligaments and fascia.<br/><br/>The term 'massage therapy' is used to describe a wide variety of techniques that vary in the manner in which touch, pressure and the intensity of the treatment is applied.<br/><br/>Massage for treatment of some disorders<br/><br/>Research indicates that massage and myotherapy are effective in managing:<br/><br/>subacute/chronic low back pain<br/><br/>delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS)<br/><br/>anxiety<br/><br/>stress<br/><br/>soft tissue injuries<br/><br/>high blood pressure<br/><br/>insomnia.<br/><br/>They can also be effectively used to support people with:<br/><br/>a chronic disease<br/><br/>a life threatening illness such as cancer.<br/><br/>Benefits of massage<br/><br/>One of the immediate benefits of massage is a feeling of deep relaxation and calm. This occurs because massage prompts the release of endorphins – the brain chemicals (neurotransmitters) that produce feelings of wellbeing.<br/><br/>Levels of stress hormones, such as adrenalin, cortisol and norepinephrine, are also reduced. Studies indicate that high levels of stress hormones impair the immune system.<br/><br/>Some of the physical benefits of massage and myotherapy include:<br/><br/>reduced muscle tension<br/><br/>improved circulation<br/><br/>stimulation of the lymphatic system<br/><br/>reduction of stress hormones<br/><br/>relaxation<br/><br/>increased joint mobility and flexibility<br/><br/>improved skin tone<br/><br/>improved recovery of soft tissue injuries<br/><br/>heightened mental alertness<br/><br/>reduced anxiety and depression | Masažna terapija<br/><br/>Masaža je morda ena najstarejših zdravilnih tradicij. Veliko starodavnih ljudstev - vključno s starodavnimi Grki, Egipčani, Kitajci in Indijci - so bili prepričani o terapevtskih lastnostih masaže in jo uporabljali za zdravljenje različnih bolezni.<br/><br/>Masažna terapija je praksa gnetenja ali manipulacije mišic osebe in drugih mehkih tkiv, da bi izboljšali njihovo dobro počutje ali zdravje. To je oblika ročne terapije, ki vključuje držanje, premikanje in pritisk na mišice, kite, vezi in fascijo.<br/><br/>Izraz "masažna terapija" se uporablja za opis različnih tehnik, ki se razlikujejo glede na način dotika, pritiska in intenzivnosti zdravljenja.<br/><br/>Masaža za zdravljenje nekaterih motenj<br/><br/>Raziskave kažejo, da sta masaža in mioterapija učinkovita pri obvladovanju:<br/><br/>subakutna/kronična bolečina v spodnjem delu hrbta<br/><br/>zakasnjena bolečina v mišicah (DOMS)<br/><br/>anksioznost<br/><br/>stres<br/><br/>poškodbe mehkih tkiv<br/><br/>visok krvni tlak<br/><br/>nespečnost.<br/><br/>Prav tako jih je mogoče učinkovito uporabiti za podporo ljudem z:<br/><br/>kronična bolezen<br/><br/>bolezen, ki ogroža življenje, kot je rak.<br/><br/>Prednosti masaže<br/><br/>Ena od neposrednih koristi masaže je občutek globoke sprostitve in miru. To se zgodi, ker masaža spodbuja sproščanje endorfinov - možganskih kemikalij (nevrotransmiterjev), ki ustvarjajo občutek dobrega počutja.<br/><br/>Prav tako se zmanjšajo ravni stresnih hormonov, kot so adrenalin, kortizol in norepinefrin. Študije kažejo, da visoke ravni stresnih hormonov oslabijo imunski sistem.<br/><br/>Nekatere fizične prednosti masaže in mioterapije vključujejo:<br/><br/>zmanjšana mišična napetost<br/><br/>Izboljšana cirkulacija<br/><br/>stimulacija limfnega sistema<br/><br/>Zmanjšanje stresnih hormonov<br/><br/>sprostitev<br/><br/>večja skupna mobilnost in fleksibilnost<br/><br/>izboljšan ton kože<br/><br/>izboljšano okrevanje po poškodbah mehkih tkiv<br/><br/>povečana duševna budnost<br/><br/>zmanjšana anksioznost in depresija |

| Mistakes happen and it can be a long road to recovery when it comes to rebuilding credit.<br/><br/>The Shopping Cart trick is useful for people who have:<br/><br/>1. Declared bankruptcy in the past and is trying to recover 2. Defaulted on payments in the past 3. A lot of credit inquiries and doesn't want to add more inquiries 4. Made late payments in the past and had their accounts closed because of this 5. Someone who doesn't have a credit score at all<br/><br/>The caveat is If they ask you to enter your whole social security number, and not just the last 4, then it will most likely be a hard inquiry. With anything mentioned in this post, your mileage may vary, so it may work for some people and not for others.<br/><br/>If you use this method and have defaulted on payments in the past, be sure to pay off your bills every month.<br/><br/>The Shopping Cart Trick<br/><br/>The Shopping Cart Trick is visiting a website and waiting for a credit card offer to pop up when you check out. You do not need to purchase anything, it will appear before the payment page. This method only works for certain stores.<br/><br/>A few examples are Express, Overstock.com, and Williams-Sonoma. There are a few Synchrony cards like Walmart and QVC that work as well. Full list of stores can be found at the end of this post.<br/><br/>When you go through the process, be sure to have the ad blocker turned off and enter your real address. If the store can't match the last 4 digits of your SSN with your address, then the soft pull won't work. Again, you might have to go through the shopping process a few times before you receive an offer. You don't have to buy anything.<br/><br/>The credit limits might be lower for some people, but the idea is to rebuild your credit. If you do choose to go through this process, I recommend picking stores you will actually shop. It doesn't make sense to get a bonus or points at a store you don't shop at. Most, if not all of the cards, don't have annual fees, so they are good as foundation cards.<br/><br/>For me, this trick doesn't work out well because I don't frequent the listed shops often | Napake se zgodijo in to je lahko dolga pot do okrevanja, ko gre za obnovo kredita.<br/><br/>Trik nakupovalne košarice je uporaben za ljudi, ki imajo:<br/><br/>1. Razglašena stečaj v preteklosti in poskuša obnoviti 2. Neplačana plačila v preteklosti 3. Veliko kreditnih poizvedb in ne želi dodati več poizvedb 4. Zapoznela plačila v preteklosti in so bili njihovi računi zaprti zaradi tega 5. Nekdo, ki sploh nima kreditne ocene<br/><br/>Opozorilo je, če vas prosijo, da vnesete celotno številko socialnega zavarovanja, in ne samo zadnje 4, potem bo najverjetneje težko poizvedovanje. Z vsem, kar je omenjeno v tem postu, se lahko vaša kilometrina razlikuje, zato lahko deluje za nekatere ljudi in ne za druge.<br/><br/>Če uporabljate to metodo in ste v preteklosti zamudili s plačili, se prepričajte, da vsak mesec odplačujete račune.<br/><br/>Trik nakupovalne košarice<br/><br/>Nakupovalna košarica Trick obišče spletno stran in čaka na ponudbo kreditne kartice, da se prikaže, ko se odjavite. Ni vam treba ničesar kupiti, pojavil se bo pred stranjo za plačilo. Ta metoda deluje samo za določene trgovine.<br/><br/>Nekaj primerov so Express, Overstock.com in Williams-Sonoma. Obstaja nekaj sinhroniziranih kartic, kot sta Walmart in QVC, ki delujejo tudi. Celoten seznam trgovin je na voljo na koncu te objave.<br/><br/>Ko greste skozi postopek, se prepričajte, da je blokator oglasov izklopljen in vnesite svoj pravi naslov. Če trgovina ne more ujemati zadnjih 4 števk vašega SSN z vašim naslovom, potem mehki poteg ne bo deloval. Še enkrat, boste morda morali iti skozi nakupovalni proces nekajkrat, preden prejmete ponudbo. Ni vam treba ničesar kupiti.<br/><br/>Kreditne omejitve so lahko za nekatere ljudi nižje, vendar je ideja, da obnovite svoj kredit. Če se odločite za ta proces, priporočam, da izberete trgovine, ki jih boste dejansko nakupovali. Ni smiselno, da bi dobili bonus ali točke v trgovini, v kateri ne nakupujete. Večina, če ne vse kartice, nimajo letnih pristojbin, zato so dobre kot temeljne kartice.<br/><br/>Zame ta trik ne deluje dobro, ker ne pogosto obiskujem navedenih trgovin |
| Composition in Design – 15 Things You Can't Afford NOT to Know<br/><br/>Composition is one of the six crucial elements of design. Without strong and solid design composition, everything starts falling apart.<br/><br/>In this article we will give you 15 tips on how to strengthen your composition – no matter if it's a photography, illustration or any graphic design project.<br/><br/>We also prepared a beautiful collection of designs in the end, for your inspirarion. Enjoy!<br/><br/>1 . Direct the eye with leading lines<br/><br/>Usually, when you look at any visual, your eye falls first on particular object. In this case, this is the car and it is the focal point of the poster. We will talk a little bit more in our second point of the article. But if your eyes are immidiatelt attracted to certain part of visual, where do you look next? That is a tough question to start with, but a simple answer would be – you look where your eyes lead you. And your eyes lead you, where the designer uses leading lines to direct you through the layout. In this case, a leading line is the road. It also nicely frames the text on the left side and leads your eye back to the focal point of the poster.<br/><br/>Often lines can be more obvious then here, directly using arrows, flowcharts and are very useful method for explaining information and sequences.<br/><br/>2. Create focus in your design composition<br/><br/>A key element to design composition is having a strong focal point. No matter how many elements you have in your design, you have to stress and show the viewer, which is the most important part of your piece. In this case, the artist used color, contrast and scale to organize the space and create focal point. Keep in mind that the most important role of design is to communicate. Therefore, your focal point would be also your most important statement and message to your audience!<br/><br/>3. Use hierachy<br/><br/>Once that you've created your focal point, you have to figure out what to do with the rest of the elements of your design composition. Of course, you have structure these elements as well, and set a priority to them. In this example, the focal point is the man in the picture. Then, we have to look for a name of the event, what is the whole thing about. Only after that, we can keep looking for additional info, such as subheadings, dates, numbers, etc.<br/><br/>All this organization of the information with the help of size, color, weight is called hierachy.<br/><br/>4. Use complementing elements<br/><br/>Always seek to create unifed look throughout your entire design. It is not a good idea to mix and match images from different sources, with no simillarities in style between them. This will only tire the eyes of the viewer and confuse him/her.<br/><br/>This website design is a great example of cohesiveness between the images – they all have simple, one color background and the object are placed in the center. Of course, your design solution would depend on the specific project need.<br/><br/>In this case, you want the viewer to recognize and focus easily on the item to be bought, without any other distraction. The overal feel of the top image and color scheme is also repeated in the backgrounds of the products, so this is one more nice connection between the different parts of the design!<br/><br/>5. Repeat elements<br/><br/>Often your projects will consist of more than one page. If you repeat specific elements from one section of your design to another, you will help the viewer to orientate himself/ herself easier across the design.<br/><br/>Repeating elements are often used to create a certain theme as well and again, help the designcomposition to "stick together".<br/><br/>Some of the repeating elements you could use are: graphic motifs, type, cetrain layout reused in the different pages/parts of your project.<br/><br/>6. Balance elements<br/><br/>There are two types of balance in design composition – symmetrical and asymmetrical. The first uses similar elements, mirrored (distributed equally) on the both sides of an axis (visible or non-visible line). Symmetrical balance is very clean and elegant, but sometimes it can get a bit boring, so then, designers prefer asymmetrical balance instead. Obviously, in this scenario we won't have equal in size elements, placed in similar way.<br/><br/>Here, we look at the different sizes of the elements, the textures and so on. It helps to think of a design elements, as they have "weight". Larger elements would be "heavier". For example, if you have a big, "heavy", vertically pointing pumpkin, you can "balance" it out by using several horizontal lines and smaller objects on the opposite side of the "heavy" object.<br/><br/>7. Align elements<br/><br/>Alignment is another important tool to use in design composition and organize your elements. It often comes handy wen you have a lot of types, colors, images, headings and subheadings. There are many tools on the web, which can help you to snap and align elements to each other, leaving no room for floating pieces and messy design. Alignment brings an elegant vibe to a design. Even the most asymetric designs have some sorts of alignment and structuring of similar blocks of content.<br/><br/>It is a general rule, that when you have a long blocks of texts, left alignment would help the eye to scan more easily teh content. This poster is great visualization of this concept.<br/><br/>8. Use contrast<br/><br/>Contrast is used for drawing attention. If you boost the contrast of an element, this will make it pop. On the contrary, using elements with lower contrast will make them fade and "disappear".<br/><br/>Here, the contrast underlines the strong, geometic, bold architectural forms and the play of light and shadow. Not on last place, the small figure might be with lower contrast, compared to other elements, but it is still visible and nicely balances out the big, dark shape at the opposite, top left corner.<br/><br/>9. Use white space<br/><br/>White space is unreplacable tool in bringing clarity into your design composition. White space is not an "empty space", but necessary element, allowing your design to breathe. It also helps emphasizing the subject of interest.<br/><br/>For example, in this photo, all the white space (unoccupied by other elements) helps to focus all the attention on the woman figure and her posture. Do you think you would pay attention to this woman, if the image was filled in with many other elements? To help you understand the importance of white space, thinks of your own room. How would you feel if you have only one small passage from the door to the bed and everything is piled up with objects? How would you feel, if your bed doesn't not fill the whole room and there are no objects all around the place. Yes, you get the ideas – we all need space, even the design does.<br/><br/>10. Understand and use type of layouts<br/><br/>The first one we are going to look at is the so called, big photo or single visual layout which was was very popular for web designers in the recent years. It gives elegant, clean look, usually highlights a product or service with the help of single high-quality, engaging photo. This type of layout gives a sense of space. As you can suggest, it is not commonly used for news sites, where there is a lot of information to be presented. Here key phrase is quality over quantity.<br/><br/>Key elements to this type of layout are white space and simple typo.<br/><br/>Another type of layout is the Z layout. This is where the eye of the viewer is lead from one element of the design to other.<br/><br/>In this example we naturally first look at the photo, than our eyes are drawn to the text on the right side of the visual and then we continue scanning down, jumping from visual to text. Z layouts create rhythm and are often used on website with lot of information, where you have to orientate the user and "guide" him.<br/><br/>Another way to keep things nice, neat and organized is to use the so called golden ratio or rule of thirds. You can read more about in our article for taking amazing photos, where the same principle applies to photography. In short, dividing your layout into thirds – both vertically and horizontally and placing most important elements where these lines cross, will make your design more visually pleasing.<br/><br/>The example here is MailChimp's website. Notice how the monkey character is slightly to the left? It simply looks good! Oh, and one more thing – when you move a character across space, move it from left to right.<br/><br/>11. Create movement<br/><br/>Movement is change of place or position, an effort. It can be actual motion or it can be implied — arranging parts of the image so that the viewer gets a sense of motion by using lines, shapes, forms, textures, etc.<br/><br/>Since ancient times our eyes are more attracted to moving objects than still ones, and this was important for one's survival – in hunting and protecting yourself from animals. That is why, people are very attracted to images that depict movement and respectively, a composition with nice "flow" of elements is more intriguing.<br/><br/>12. People like triangles<br/><br/>The shape of triangle creates interest, sets a direction and creates movement. Surely, it is a very strong shape and designers and artists use it to organize their layout as well, and not only as visual element. In the recent years, it became hugely popular with the polygon design.<br/><br/>13. Simplification<br/><br/>Simplification is the technique of reducing a composition to only the most essential elements that support the visual statement.<br/><br/>If every part is equally important, then every part is equally unimportant. Nathan Fowkes<br/><br/>It is natural for the eyes to look at details, but it is very hard to see the design as whole and how all elements work together. When in doubt, better remove elements from your design composition, rather adding and trying to find a place for them. We know it's a cliche – but it is still legit "Less is more"!<br/><br/>14. See where your elements are in relation to edges<br/><br/>Often, you will see designers using blank space around the edges of the layout, giving the design room to breathe. Again it is natural to the eye to see elements receeding around edges and fading out. If it is busy around the edges in your design – the overal feel would be of something heavy, big and it will take away from the attention of central elements.<br/><br/>In this case, the designer used large, abstract shape to underline the typo – yeard and names. Because the shape is directing the eye, varied in thickness and has sense of movement to it, it doesn't overwhelm the viewer, but on the contrary – offers him/her aesthetic pleasure and simplicity.<br/><br/>15. Mind the transitions<br/><br/>Transition in design composition is a little bit harder to define. We discussed repetition already, in comparison, transition handles the natural flow from one shape to another, leading the eye from one spot to another. Often, designers use curved lines and shapes to smoothen transition from more angular shapes and blocks of content. Transition helps to relax the eye and "soften" the design.<br/><br/>Looking for some inspiration?<br/><br/>Now that you learnt something about the most important ingredients of good design composition, we made a small gallery with design compositions we find inspiring. Enjoy | Sestava v oblikovanju - 15 stvari, ki si jih ne morete privoščiti<br/><br/>Kompozicija je eden od šestih ključnih elementov oblikovanja. Brez močne in trdne oblikovne kompozicije se vse začne razpadati.<br/><br/>V tem članku vam bomo dali 15 nasvetov o tem, kako okrepiti svojo kompozicijo – ne glede na to, ali gre za fotografijo, ilustracijo ali kateri koli grafični projekt.<br/><br/>Na koncu smo pripravili tudi čudovito zbirko modelov, za vaš navdih. Uživajte!<br/><br/>1. Usmerite oko z vodilnimi črtami<br/><br/>Običajno, ko pogledate katero koli vizualno, vaše oko najprej pade na določen predmet. V tem primeru je to avto in je osrednja točka plakata. V drugi točki članka bomo govorili malo več. Ampak, če so vaše oči immidiatelt privlači določen del vizualnega, kje gledate naslednji? To je težko vprašanje za začetek, vendar preprost odgovor bi bil – gledate, kam vas oči vodijo. In vaše oči vas vodijo, kjer oblikovalec uporablja vodilne črte, ki vas usmerjajo skozi postavitev. V tem primeru je vodilna črta cesta. Prav tako lepo uokvirja besedilo na levi strani in vodi oko nazaj do žarišča plakata.<br/><br/>Pogosto so lahko črte bolj očitne kot tukaj, neposredno s puščicami, diagrami poteka in so zelo uporabna metoda za razlago informacij in zaporedij.<br/><br/>2. Ustvarite poudarek v svoji kompoziciji oblikovanja<br/><br/>Ključni element pri oblikovanju kompozicije je močna žariščna točka. Ne glede na to, koliko elementov imate v svojem oblikovanju, morate poudariti in pokazati gledalcu, ki je najpomembnejši del vašega dela. V tem primeru je umetnik uporabil barvo, kontrast in merilo za organizacijo prostora in ustvarjanje osrednje točke. Upoštevajte, da je najpomembnejša vloga oblikovanja komunikacija. Zato bi bila vaša osrednja točka tudi vaša najpomembnejša izjava in sporočilo vašemu občinstvu!<br/><br/>3. Uporabite hierarhijo<br/><br/>Ko ste ustvarili svojo osrednjo točko, morate ugotoviti, kaj storiti s preostalimi elementi vaše oblikovalske kompozicije. Seveda imate tudi strukturo teh elementov in jim določite prednost. V tem primeru je osrednja točka človek na sliki. Potem moramo poiskati ime dogodka, o čem je celotna stvar. Šele po tem lahko nadaljujemo z iskanjem dodatnih informacij, kot so podnaslovi, datumi, številke itd.<br/><br/>Vsa ta organizacija informacij s pomočjo velikosti, barve, teže se imenuje hierarhija.<br/><br/>4. Uporabite dopolnjujoče elemente<br/><br/>Vedno si prizadevajte ustvariti edinstven videz skozi celotno zasnovo. Ni dobra ideja, da mešate in ujemate slike iz različnih virov, brez podobnosti v slogu med njimi. To bo le utrudilo oči gledalca in ga zmedlo.<br/><br/>Oblikovanje te spletne strani je odličen primer kohezivnosti med slikami - vse imajo preprosto, eno barvno ozadje in predmet je postavljen v središče. Seveda bi bila vaša oblikovalska rešitev odvisna od specifičnih projektnih potreb.<br/><br/>V tem primeru želite, da gledalec zlahka prepozna in se osredotoči na predmet, ki ga je treba kupiti, brez kakršnih koli drugih motenj. Overal občutek zgornje slike in barvne sheme se ponavlja tudi v ozadju izdelkov, zato je to še ena lepa povezava med različnimi deli oblikovanja!<br/><br/>5. Ponovite elemente<br/><br/>Pogosto bodo vaši projekti sestavljeni iz več kot ene strani. Če ponavljate določene elemente iz enega dela vašega dizajna v drugega, boste gledalcu pomagali, da se lažje orientira skozi dizajn.<br/><br/>Ponavljajoči se elementi se pogosto uporabljajo za ustvarjanje določene teme tudi znova in znova, pomagajo oblikovanjukompozicije, da se "drži skupaj".<br/><br/>Nekateri ponavljajoči se elementi, ki jih lahko uporabite, so: grafični motivi, tip, postavitev cetraina, ki se ponovno uporabijo na različnih straneh / delih vašega projekta.<br/><br/>6. Elementi ravnotežja<br/><br/>Pri oblikovanju sestave sta dve vrsti ravnotežja – simetrična in asimetrična. Prva uporablja podobne elemente, zrcalno (enakomerno porazdeljene) na obeh straneh osi (vidna ali nevidna črta). Simetrično ravnovesje je zelo čisto in elegantno, včasih pa lahko postane malo dolgočasno, zato oblikovalci raje namesto asimetričnega ravnovesja. Očitno je, da v tem scenariju ne bomo imeli enakih velikosti elementov, postavljenih na podoben način.<br/><br/>Tukaj pogledamo različne velikosti elementov, teksture in tako naprej. Pomaga razmišljati o oblikovalskih elementih, saj imajo "težjo". Večji elementi bi bili "težji". Na primer, če imate veliko, "težko", navpično usmerjeno bučo, jo lahko "uravnotežite" z uporabo več vodoravnih črt in manjših predmetov na nasprotni strani "težkega" predmeta.<br/><br/>7. Poravnava elementov<br/><br/>Poravnava je še eno pomembno orodje, ki ga lahko uporabite pri oblikovanju sestave in organizirate svoje elemente. Pogosto je koristno, če imate veliko vrst, barv, slik, naslovov in podnaslovov. Na spletu je veliko orodij, ki vam lahko pomagajo zaskočiti in poravnati elemente drug z drugim, ne puščajo prostora za plavajoče kose in neurejeno obliko. Poravnava prinaša elegantno vibracijo v oblikovanje. Tudi najbolj asimetrični modeli imajo nekakšno poravnavo in strukturiranje podobnih blokov vsebine.<br/><br/>Splošno pravilo je, da če imate dolge bloke besedil, bi leva poravnava pomagala očesu lažje skenirati vsebino. Ta plakat je odlična vizualizacija tega koncepta.<br/><br/>8. Uporabite kontrast<br/><br/>Kontrast se uporablja za pritegnitev pozornosti. Če povečate kontrast elementa, ga bo to naredilo pop. Nasprotno, z uporabo elementov z nižjim kontrastom bodo zbledeli in "izginili".<br/><br/>Tukaj kontrast poudarja močne, geometične, drzne arhitekturne oblike in igro svetlobe in sence. Ne na zadnjem mestu je lahko majhna figura z nižjim kontrastom v primerjavi z drugimi elementi, vendar je še vedno vidna in lepo uravnava veliko, temno obliko na nasprotnem, zgornjem levem kotu.<br/><br/>9. Uporabite beli prostor<br/><br/>Beli prostor je nenadomestljivo orodje pri zagotavljanju jasnosti v vašo oblikovalsko kompozicijo. Beli prostor ni "prazni prostor", temveč potreben element, ki omogoča, da vaš dizajn diha. Prav tako pomaga poudariti predmet zanimanja.<br/><br/>Na primer, na tej fotografiji ves beli prostor (nezaseden z drugimi elementi) pomaga osredotočiti vso pozornost na žensko sliko in njeno držo. Ali mislite, da bi bili pozorni na to žensko, če bi bila slika napolnjena z mnogimi drugimi elementi? Da bi vam pomagali razumeti pomen belega prostora, pomislite na svojo sobo. Kako bi se počutili, če bi imeli le en majhen prehod od vrat do postelje in vse je nakopičeno s predmeti? Kako bi se počutili, če vaša postelja ne zapolnjuje celotne sobe in ni predmetov povsod. Da, dobite ideje - vsi potrebujemo prostor, tudi zasnova.<br/><br/>10. Razumevanje in uporaba vrste postavitev<br/><br/>Prva, ki si jo bomo ogledali, je tako imenovana, velika fotografija ali enotna vizualna postavitev, ki je bila v zadnjih letih zelo priljubljena za spletne oblikovalce. Daje eleganten, čist videz, običajno poudarja izdelek ali storitev s pomočjo ene same visokokakovostne, privlačne fotografije. Ta vrsta postavitve daje občutek prostora. Kot lahko predlagate, se običajno ne uporablja za novičarske strani, kjer je veliko informacij, ki jih je treba predstaviti. Tukaj je ključna fraza kakovost nad količino.<br/><br/>Ključni elementi te vrste postavitve so beli prostor in preprosta tipkanja.<br/><br/>Druga vrsta postavitve je postavitev Z. To je, ko je oko gledalca vodilo od enega elementa zasnove do drugega.<br/><br/>V tem primeru seveda najprej pogledamo fotografijo, nato pa se naše oči pritegnejo k besedilu na desni strani vizualnega in nato nadaljujemo s skeniranjem navzdol, skačemo iz vizualnega v besedilo. Z postavitve ustvarjajo ritem in se pogosto uporabljajo na spletni strani z veliko informacij, kjer morate usmeriti uporabnika in ga "voditi".<br/><br/>Drug način, da stvari ostanejo lepe, urejene in organizirane, je uporaba tako imenovanega zlatega razmerja ali pravila tretjin. Več o tem lahko preberete v našem članku za fotografiranje neverjetnih fotografij, kjer enako načelo velja za fotografijo. Skratka, razdelitev vaše postavitve na tretjine - tako navpično kot vodoravno in postavitev najpomembnejših elementov, kjer se te črte križajo, bo vaš dizajn bolj vizualno prijeten.<br/><br/>Primer tukaj je spletna stran MailChimp. Opazite, kako je znak opice nekoliko levo? Preprosto izgleda dobro! Oh, in še ena stvar - ko premaknete znak po prostoru, ga premaknete od leve proti desni.<br/><br/>11. Ustvarite gibanje<br/><br/>Gibanje je sprememba mesta ali položaja, napor. Lahko je dejansko gibanje ali se lahko implicira - ureditev delov slike, tako da gledalec dobi občutek gibanja z uporabo črt, oblik, oblik, tekstur itd.<br/><br/>Že od antičnih časov naše oči bolj privlačijo premikajoči se predmeti kot še vedno, in to je bilo pomembno za preživetje – pri lovu in zaščiti pred živalmi. Zato so ljudje zelo privlačni za podobe, ki prikazujejo gibanje in kompozicijo z lepim "pretokom" elementov.<br/><br/>12. Ljudje imajo radi trikotnike<br/><br/>Oblika trikotnika ustvarja zanimanje, določa smer in ustvarja gibanje. Zagotovo je zelo močna oblika, oblikovalci in umetniki pa jo uporabljajo tudi za organizacijo njihove postavitve, ne le kot vizualni element. V zadnjih letih je postal zelo priljubljen pri oblikovanju poligona.<br/><br/>13. Poenostavitev<br/><br/>Poenostavitev je tehnika zmanjševanja kompozicije le na najpomembnejše elemente, ki podpirajo vizualno izjavo.<br/><br/>Če je vsak del enako pomemben, potem je vsak del enako nepomemben. Nathan Fowkes<br/><br/>Naravno je, da oči gledajo na podrobnosti, vendar je zelo težko videti zasnovo kot celoto in kako vsi elementi delujejo skupaj. Ko ste v dvomih, bolje odstranite elemente iz svoje oblikovalske kompozicije, namesto da bi dodali in poskušali najti prostor za njih. Vemo, da je kliše – vendar je še vedno legitimno “manj je več”!<br/><br/>14. Oglejte si, kje so vaši elementi glede na robove<br/><br/>Pogosto boste videli oblikovalce, ki uporabljajo prazen prostor okoli robov postavitve, kar daje prostor za oblikovanje, da diha. Spet je naravno za oko, da vidi elemente, ki se umikajo okoli robov in izginjajo. Če je v vašem dizajnu zasedena okoli robov, bi bil občutek nekaj težkega, velikega in bi odvzel pozornost osrednjih elementov.<br/><br/>V tem primeru je oblikovalec uporabil veliko, abstraktno obliko, da bi poudaril tipkanje - letnik in imena. Ker oblika usmerja oko, je raznolika v debelini in ima občutek za gibanje, ne preplavi gledalca, temveč mu ponuja estetski užitek in preprostost.<br/><br/>15. Bodite pozorni na prehode<br/><br/>Prehod v oblikovanju kompozicije je nekoliko težje opredeliti. Ponovitev smo že razpravljali, v primerjavi s tem, prehod ravna naravni tok iz ene oblike v drugo, ki vodi oko iz ene točke v drugo. Oblikovalci pogosto uporabljajo ukrivljene črte in oblike, da bi olajšali prehod iz bolj kotnih oblik in blokov vsebine. Prehod pomaga sprostiti oko in "mehčati" zasnovo.<br/><br/>Iščete nekaj navdiha?<br/><br/>Zdaj, ko ste se naučili nekaj o najpomembnejših sestavinah dobre oblikovalske kompozicije, smo naredili majhno galerijo z oblikovalskimi kompozicijami, ki se nam zdijo navdihujoče. |

| Memory CD8+ T cells are essential cells of the immune system, retained post infection to protect from subsequent immunological insults. Many transcriptional regulators and some proximal signaling cascades associated with both naive and memory T cells have been described and have greatly informed the process by which immunological memory is formed. Despite clear differences in transcription factor expression and cytokine requirements, how global signal transduction induced by antigen binding differs between naive and memory CD8+ T cells is completely unknown and thus represents a significant gap in our knowledge base. One key signaling event that occurs in response to TCR stimulation is the activation of kinases that phosphorylate tyrosine residues on downstream signaling proteins. Therefore, comparing the phosphotyrosine signaling networks between naive and memory T cells will identify targets for modulation of the CD8+ T cell immune response to positively influence response to disease and vaccine efficacy. The objective of this specific proposal is to determine the intracellular signaling pathways that are unique to restimulated memory CD8+ T cells. Our central hypothesis is that distinct signal transduction pathways regulate the memory CD8+ T cell response. The rationale and scientific premise for the proposed work is that understanding at a global proteomic level the changes that occur in T cells as they differentiate from naive to memory T cells will enable more efficacious vaccine and drug treatment design to combat disease and infection. We will test our central hypothesis with the following specific aims: 1) Determine the TCR signal transduction changes that occur in CD8+ nave and memory T cells. To profile kinase signaling networks, we will utilize a highly sensitive quantitative mass spectrometric assay we developed on naive, effector and memory CD8+ T cells. Based on a preliminary screen, we identified that Jak2 is hyperphosphorylated, indicating it is a key mediator of the recall response. We will test the hypothesis that Jak2 hyperactivation is critical for memory recall responses. Together, the completion of Aim1 will identify novel signaling networks that contribute to CD8+ memory recall responses and 2) Defining phosphorylation of CREB binding protein (CBP) as a molecular switch that regulates transcriptional networks in memory CD8+ T cells. Given our preliminary data in which we uncovered unique signaling pathways associated with CD8+ memory T cell formation, we hypothesize that in memory CD8+ T cells, increased Jak2 activation drives phosphorylation of CBP to promote a unique transcriptional landscape versus a nave T cell. We will identify how phosphorylation of CBP regulates binding of transcription factors such as CREB and MYB. Additionally, we will take a genetic approach to determine how CBP functions in the formation of CD8+ memory cells and CD8+ memory recall responses. Together, data obtained in this Aim2 will establish a novel mechanism that explains how changes in tyrosine kinase activity associated with CD8+ T cell memory formation drive unique transcriptional programs.<br/><br/>Public Health Relevance<br/><br/>The studies proposed herein will determine, using mass spectrometry, the signal transduction events that take place in memory CD8+ T cells upon restimulation, relative to nave CD8+ T cells. Given that these cells play an essential role in protection from secondary infection, it is imperative that we understand the molecular mechanisms by which these cells exert their effector function for the protection of human health. | Pomnilniške celice CD8+ T so esencialne celice imunskega sistema, ki se ohranijo po okužbi za zaščito pred kasnejšimi imunološkimi poškodbami. Mnogi transkripcijski regulatorji in nekatere proksimalne signalne kaskade, povezane z naivnimi in spominskimi T-celicami, so bili opisani in so v veliki meri informirali proces, s katerim se oblikuje imunološki spomin. Kljub jasnim razlikam v izražanju transkripcijskih faktorjev in zahtevah po citokinah je globalna transdukcija signala, ki jo povzroča vezava antigena, med naivnimi in spominskimi celicami CD8+ T popolnoma neznana in tako predstavlja pomembno vrzel v naši bazi znanja. Ključni signalni dogodek, ki se pojavi kot odziv na stimulacijo TCR, je aktivacija kinaz, ki fosforilirajo ostanke tirozina na signalnih beljakovinah. Zato bo primerjava fosfotirozinskih signalnih omrežij med naivnimi in spominskimi T-celicami identificirala cilje za modulacijo imunskega odziva CD8+ T-celic na pozitiven vpliv na odziv na bolezen in učinkovitost cepiva. Cilj tega posebnega predloga je določiti znotrajcelične signalne poti, ki so edinstvene za restimulirane spominske celice CD8 + T. Naša osrednja hipoteza je, da različne poti prenosa signala uravnavajo odziv spominskih celic CD8 + T. Utemeljitev in znanstvena predpostavka za predlagano delo je, da bo razumevanje sprememb, ki se pojavljajo v T-celicah na globalni proteomski ravni, ko se razlikujejo od naivnih do spominskih T-celic, omogočilo učinkovitejšo zasnovo cepiva in zdravljenja z zdravili za boj proti boleznim in okužbam. Osrednjo hipotezo bomo preizkusili z naslednjimi specifičnimi cilji: 1) Določite spremembe transdukcije signala TCR, ki se pojavijo v celicah CD8 + nave in spominskih T celicah. Za profiliranje signalnih omrežij kinaz bomo uporabili zelo občutljiv kvantitativni masni spektrometrični test, ki smo ga razvili na naivnih, efektorskih in spominskih celicah CD8+ T. Na podlagi predhodnega zaslona smo ugotovili, da je Jak2 hiperfosforiliran, kar kaže, da je ključni posrednik odziva na odpoklic. Testirali bomo hipotezo, da je Jak2 hiperaktivacija ključnega pomena za odzive na odpoklic spomina. Skupaj bo dokončanje Aim1 identificiralo nova signalna omrežja, ki prispevajo k odzivom spomina CD8 + in 2) Opredelitev fosforilacije CREB-vezujočega proteina (CBP) kot molekularnega stikala, ki uravnava transkripcijska omrežja v pomnilniških celicah CD8 + T. Glede na naše predhodne podatke, v katerih smo odkrili edinstvene signalne poti, povezane s tvorbo CD8 + pomnilniških T celic, predvidevamo, da v pomnilniških CD8 + T celicah povečana aktivacija Jak2 poganja fosforilacijo CBP za spodbujanje edinstvene transkripcijske pokrajine v primerjavi z navo T celico. Opredelili bomo, kako fosforilacija CBP uravnava vezavo transkripcijskih faktorjev, kot sta CREB in MYB. Poleg tega bomo z genetskim pristopom določili, kako CBP deluje pri nastanku spominskih celic CD8+ in odzivih spominskega odpoklica CD8+. Skupaj bodo podatki, pridobljeni v tem cilju 2, vzpostavili nov mehanizem, ki pojasnjuje, kako spremembe v aktivnosti tirozinske kinaze, povezane s CD8 + T celičnim spominom, vodijo edinstvene transkripcijske programe.<br/><br/>Pomen javnega zdravja<br/><br/>Študije, predlagane v tem dokumentu, bodo z uporabo masne spektrometrije določile dogodke prenosa signalov, ki se pojavijo v celicah spomina CD8+ T po restimulaciji, v primerjavi z celicami nave CD8+ T. Glede na to, da imajo te celice bistveno vlogo pri zaščiti pred sekundarno okužbo, je nujno, da razumemo molekularne mehanizme, s katerimi te celice izvajajo svojo funkcijo efektorja za zaščito zdravja ljudi. |
