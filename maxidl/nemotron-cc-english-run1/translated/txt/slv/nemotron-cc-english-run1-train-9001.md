| UNDERSTANDING SELF-EXECUTING TREATIES VIA STATE PRACTICE<br/><br/>Updated: Feb 2<br/><br/>Introduction:<br/><br/>Consider this paradox, when a country ratifies a treaty, it is said to have consented to accept the treaty in its entirety (reservations and declarations being exceptions); but in some cases, the countries go ahead and refuse to adhere to its provisions. For example, Article VI, Clause 2 of the American Constitution has the provisions that "all treaties … shall be the supreme Law of the Land." Although it is evident that treaties on their own do not have the same effect as federal laws. In truth, they only become operational once these provisions come into force as Federal law with Senate and Presidential approval. Although this is the practice, it is a generally accepted principle in international law that certain treaties have a binding effect on countries. The treaty must fulfil the requirement of being a self-executing treaty to affect the country without any corresponding domestic legislature directly.<br/><br/>This raises the question as to which treaty will qualify as "self-executing" and which will not?<br/><br/>Whether a treaty is a self-executing treaty or not is decided by national judges on a case-to-case basis (Buergenthal, 1992). In order to understand this, the paper will first look at the two types of theories followed by countries on the nature of treaties applying to domestic law. These two theories are monism and dualism. They basically view the framework of domestic and international law as a single hierarchy and two separate hierarchies, respectively (Wildhaber, 1971). Countries following monism believe that certain treaties immediately are binding and immediately have an effect on the country. Once the treaty has been ratified, it can be invoked in national courts and is considered to be a part of the law of the country. Countries following dualism believe that a treaty does not affect domestic law until it has been reinforced by a legislature passed in the parliament. An example of dualism is how the European Convention on Human Rights became operational in the United Kingdom after passing the Human Rights Act 1998 in their parliament (Laws, 2000).<br/><br/>International law is diverse, and so are the types of procedures different countries follow for the acceptance of treaties. Some constitutions' themselves mention the procedures for the ratification of a treaty. Some countries even have different treatment given to international treaty law and customary international law. Certain international organizations like the European Union often affect the domestic law of its member states. The member states of the European Union have to give effect to certain forms of community legislature. Although, it has an essential difference from self-executing treaties. The difference is that it is not for national judges to decide whether the provisions are self-executing or not, but rather for the European Court of Justice to interpret under its constitutive treaties. Other forms of international law formed via resolutions or such might not have the same effect for these states. Nevertheless, they might consider them as forms of "soft law" and look into them to interpret the intent of the law. Sometimes, proclamations made by the judicial organs of international organizations such as the Inter-American Court of Human Rights affect their member states. Although these proclamations are not binding on the member states, the national judges seem to refer to these for authoritative interpretation.<br/><br/>Therefore, a case-to-case approach must be taken while analyzing the procedures and precedents set in different countries. To examine the concept of self-executing treaties, this paper will compare the precedents set by different jurisdictions. If the reader wishes to conduct a similar analysis, they can do so by looking into the different national yearbooks on international law. Mostly, these yearbooks will have a section devoted to the relationship between international and national law.<br/><br/>International Jurisprudence:<br/><br/>The most significant issue that comes up for national courts is whether the treaty is self-executing? If the treaty can be applied without any additional domestic legislature having passed to reinforce it. This question came up in the case of Czesław S v State Treasury and Minister of the State Treasury, wherein the Polish Constitutional Court held that since the treaty provisions referred to domestic measures to be taken, the treaty was not self-executing in nature (Bug river claims, Czesław S v State Treasury and Minister of the State Treasury, 2003). Essentially, when the treaty refers to domestic measures to be taken, it does not in itself create new obligations. It instead reinforces the treaty's intent for the domestic legal process to take measures for the same. A similar issue was raised in the Sosa case in the United States of America. In this case, the court considered whether the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights was a self-executing treaty. The American Supreme Court has also declared that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is not a self-executing treaty (Court, 2004). The Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland also examined the self-executing nature of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The issue before the court was whether Article 13(2)(b) and (c) were self-executing in nature. The court examined whether the treaty was partially self-executing and did so by checking whether there existed a minimum core content for the treaty to be applicable. The court held that it found no such provision within the treaty (A and B v Government of the Canton of Zurich, 2000).<br/><br/>It is essential to understand that these issues differ from the fundamental question of whether international law can be applied as part of the law of the land? In order to answer this question, the paper will examine the judgement by the Supreme Court of the Dominican Republic. The Supreme Court stated that Article 3 of the Dominican Republic's Constitution made international law binding on the domestic legal order. The court rejected the Superior Land Court's interpretation that these treaties were "foreign legislature" and not part of the domestic legal order. The Supreme Court laid down that all treaties ratified by the Dominican Republic formed a part of Dominican Law and, therefore, can be termed as self-executing (Gallardo Montilla v Gallardo Concepción and ors, 1997). The Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland has examined whether the Libson Treaty was self-executing and directly applicable to Swiss Universities. The court held, "According to relevant case law, a treaty norm is directly applicable if its content is sufficiently precise and clear to form the basis of a decision in a particular case. The norm thus has to be justiciable, i.e. define the rights and obligations of an individual and be directed at the competent authorities" (X v University of Lucerne, 2014). This implies that whether the treaty is directly applicable or not, depends upon on whether the norm is justiciable. The Lisbon Treaty is based on the principle of qualifications acquired aboard. This is conveyed through Article IV (1) of the treaty. The purpose of this was to create an obligation for states to show that their decision-making process is fair, transparent and non-discriminatory. The responsibility for proving that the applicant has not met the required criteria is on the "body undertaking the assessment." The treaty guarantees procedural safeguards, which are generally accepted by countries and hence, the court held this treaty to be self-executing. This goes on to showcase the different interpretations undertaken by the courts of various countries.<br/><br/>It is essential to observe whether the norms set out by treaties are actually being complied with. The case laws from various jurisdictions have emphasized that national courts are the final authority on the issue of whether a treaty is self-executing. There is also an inherent duty cast on countries for the observance and due performance of treaties. Such is cast by the Pacta Sunt Servanda rule as enshrined within Article 26 of the Vienna Convention on Law of Treaties (VCLT). Article 27 goes on to reinforce it by stating that international law obligations cannot be ignored by using domestic law as a justification. Many countries' courts have used this as a source of interpretation, such as the Latvian Constitutional Court. In the case of a national norm conflicting with an international norm, the court held that the national norm was null and void. To reach its conclusion, the court strongly relied on the necessary performance of treaties in good faith as envisaged in Article 26 of the VCLT (Linija v Latvia, 2004).<br/><br/>Conclusion:<br/><br/>From the above, it is clear that treaties have particular requirements before they can be considered self-executing. However, keeping all of these aside, the most important still remains the national courts' interpretation. The national courts decide whether the treaty can be called self-executing or not. Although their Constitution's might contain a provision regarding treaty law being the supreme law of the land, courts from different countries interpret these provisions in different manners. This can be seen as to how the American and Dominican Constitutions' both contain these provisions but follow completely different interpretations of the same. The term "self-executing" may not be congruous for these treaties since, in practice, they still need approval from the national courts. Ideally, the way forward should be that countries acknowledge the self-executing nature of treaties and treat them in a fashion wherein Article 26 and 27 of the VCLT are respected. Again, this is the "ideal" situation and is not likely to find its way into state practice of certain jurisdictions anytime soon. Still, hope can be gained via looking into the interpretations of national courts that respect these norms and hopefully pave the way for other courts to acknowledge this.<br/><br/>References:<br/><br/>Buergenthal, T.

Na primer, člen VI, klavzula 2 ameriške ustave ima določbe, da so "vse pogodbe ... vrhovni zakon dežele." Čeprav je očitno, da pogodbe same po sebi nimajo enakega učinka kot zvezni zakoni. V resnici začnejo delovati šele, ko te določbe začnejo veljati kot zvezni zakon s senatom in predsedniško odobritvijo. Čeprav je to praksa, je splošno sprejeto načelo v mednarodnem pravu, da imajo nekatere pogodbe zavezujoč učinek na države. Pogodba mora izpolnjevati zahtevo, da je samoizvršljiva pogodba, ki neposredno vpliva na državo brez ustreznega domačega zakonodajalca.<br/><br/>To postavlja vprašanje, katera pogodba se bo opredelila kot "samoizvrševanje" in katera ne?<br/><br/>O tem, ali je pogodba samoizvršljiva ali ne, odločajo nacionalni sodniki za vsak primer posebej (Buergenthal, 1992). Da bi to razumeli, bomo najprej preučili dve vrsti teorij, ki jima sledijo države o naravi pogodb, ki se uporabljajo za domače pravo. Ti dve teoriji sta monizem in dualizem. V bistvu vidijo okvir domačega in mednarodnega prava kot eno hierarhijo in dve ločeni hierarhiji (Wildhaber, 1971). Države, ki sledijo monizmu, verjamejo, da so nekatere pogodbe takoj zavezujoče in imajo takojšen učinek na državo. Ko je pogodba ratificirana, se lahko sklicuje na nacionalna sodišča in se šteje za del prava države. Države, ki sledijo dualizmu, verjamejo, da pogodba ne vpliva na notranjo zakonodajo, dokler je ne okrepi zakonodajalec, ki je bil sprejet v parlamentu. Primer dualizma je, kako je Evropska konvencija o človekovih pravicah začela delovati v Združenem kraljestvu po sprejetju Zakona o človekovih pravicah 1998 v njihovem parlamentu (Zakoni, 2000).<br/><br/>Mednarodno pravo je raznoliko, prav tako vrste postopkov, ki jih različne države uporabljajo za sprejemanje pogodb. Nekatere ustave same omenjajo postopke za ratifikacijo pogodbe. Nekatere države imajo celo drugačno obravnavo mednarodnega pogodbenega prava in običajnega mednarodnega prava. Nekatere mednarodne organizacije, kot je Evropska unija, pogosto vplivajo na domače pravo svojih držav članic. Države članice Evropske unije morajo uveljaviti določene oblike zakonodajalca Skupnosti, čeprav se bistveno razlikuje od samoizvršnih pogodb. Razlika je v tem, da o tem, ali so določbe samoizvršljive ali ne, ne odločajo nacionalni sodniki, temveč Sodišče Evropske unije, ki razlaga te določbe v skladu s svojimi ustavodajnimi pogodbami. Druge oblike mednarodnega prava, oblikovane z resolucijami ali takšnimi, morda nimajo enakega učinka za te države. Kljub temu bi jih lahko obravnavali kot oblike "mehkega prava" in jih preučili za razlago namena prava. Včasih razglasitve sodnih organov mednarodnih organizacij, kot je Medameriško sodišče za človekove pravice, vplivajo na njihove države članice. Čeprav te razglasitve niso zavezujoče za države članice, se zdi, da se nacionalni sodniki nanje sklicujejo zaradi avtoritativne razlage.<br/><br/>Zato je treba pri analizi postopkov in precedensov, določenih v različnih državah, uporabiti pristop od primera do primera. Da bi preučili koncept samoizvršnih pogodb, bomo v tem prispevku primerjali precedense, določene v različnih jurisdikcijah. Če želi bralec izvesti podobno analizo, lahko to stori tako, da si ogleda različne nacionalne letopise o mednarodnem pravu. V glavnem bodo ti letopisi imeli razdelek, namenjen razmerju med mednarodnim in nacionalnim pravom.<br/><br/>Mednarodna sodna praksa:<br/><br/>Najpomembnejše vprašanje, ki se pojavlja za nacionalna sodišča, je, ali je pogodba samoizvrševanje? Če je mogoče pogodbo uporabljati, ne da bi kateri koli dodatni domači zakonodajalec sprejela, da ga okrepi. To vprašanje se je pojavilo v zadevi Czesław S proti državni zakladnici in ministru za državno zakladnico, v kateri je poljsko ustavno sodišče odločilo, da pogodba, ker so se določbe pogodbe nanašale na domače ukrepe, ki jih je treba sprejeti, ni bila samoizvršljiva (terjatve reke Bug, Czesław S proti državni zakladnici in minister za državno zakladnico, 2003). Ko se pogodba sklicuje na domače ukrepe, ki jih je treba sprejeti, sama po sebi ne ustvarja novih obveznosti, temveč krepi namen pogodbe, da bi domači pravni postopek sprejel ukrepe za to. Podobno vprašanje je bilo postavljeno v zadevi Sosa v Združenih državah Amerike. V tem primeru je sodišče preučilo, ali je Mednarodni pakt o državljanskih in političnih pravicah samoizvršna pogodba. Ameriško vrhovno sodišče je tudi razsodilo, da Mednarodni pakt o državljanskih in političnih pravicah ni samoizvršljiva pogodba (Sodišče, 2004). Zvezno vrhovno sodišče Švice je prav tako preučilo samoizvršitveno naravo Mednarodnega pakta o državljanskih in političnih pravicah. Vprašanje pred sodiščem je bilo, ali sta bila člena 13(2)(b) in (c) samoizvršitvena po naravi. Sodišče je preučilo, ali je bila pogodba delno samoizvršljiva, in to s preverjanjem, ali obstaja minimalna osnovna vsebina pogodbe, ki naj bi se uporabljala. Sodišče je ugotovilo, da take določbe ni našlo v pogodbi (A in B proti vladi kantona Zürich, 2000).<br/><br/>Bistveno je razumeti, da se ta vprašanja razlikujejo od temeljnega vprašanja, ali se lahko mednarodno pravo uporablja kot del deželnega prava? Da bi odgovorili na to vprašanje, bo dokument preučil sodbo vrhovnega sodišča Dominikanske republike. Vrhovno sodišče je navedlo, da je člen 3 ustave Dominikanske republike mednarodno pravo zavezujoče za domači pravni red. Sodišče je zavrnilo razlago vrhovnega deželnega sodišča, da so te pogodbe "tuji zakonodajalec" in ne del domačega pravnega reda. Vrhovno sodišče je določilo, da so vse pogodbe, ki jih je ratificirala Dominikanska republika, sestavni del dominikanskega prava in se zato lahko imenujejo samoizvršitvene (Gallardo Montilla proti Gallardo Concepción in ors, 1997). Zvezno vrhovno sodišče Švice je preučilo, ali je bila Libsonska pogodba samoizvršljiva in neposredno veljavna za švicarske univerze. V skladu z ustrezno sodno prakso se pogodba neposredno uporablja, če je njena vsebina dovolj natančna in jasna, da tvori podlago za odločitev v določenem primeru. Norma mora biti torej pravnomočna, tj. opredeliti pravice in obveznosti posameznika ter biti naslovljena na pristojne organe" (X proti Univerzi v Lucernu, 2014). To pomeni, da je neposredno veljavna pogodba ali ne, odvisno od tega, ali je norma pravnomočna. Lizbonska pogodba temelji na načelu kvalifikacij, pridobljenih na krovu. To se prenaša s členom IV(1) Pogodbe. Namen tega je bil ustvariti obveznost, da države dokažejo, da je njihov postopek odločanja pošten, pregleden in nediskriminatoren. Odgovornost za dokazovanje, da prosilec ni izpolnil zahtevanih meril, je na „organu, ki izvaja ocenjevanje“. Pogodba zagotavlja postopkovna jamstva, ki jih države na splošno sprejemajo, zato je sodišče to pogodbo štelo za samoizvršljivo. To kaže na različne razlage, ki jih sprejemajo sodišča različnih držav.<br/><br/>Bistveno je, da se ugotovi, ali se dejansko spoštujejo norme, določene v pogodbah. V sodni praksi različnih jurisdikcij je poudarjeno, da so nacionalna sodišča končni organ pri vprašanju, ali je pogodba samoizvršljiva. Prav tako je državam naložena dolžnost, da spoštujejo in ustrezno izvršujejo pogodbe, kot jo določa pravilo Pacta Sunt Servanda, kot je določeno v členu 26 Dunajske konvencije o mednarodnem pravu (VCLT). Člen 27 ga še krepi z navedbo, da obveznosti mednarodnega prava ni mogoče prezreti z uporabo domačega prava kot utemeljitve. To sodišča številnih držav uporabljajo kot vir razlage, kot je na primer latvijsko ustavno sodišče. V primeru nacionalne norme, ki je v nasprotju z mednarodno normo, je sodišče presodilo, da je nacionalna norma nična. Sodišče se je pri svojem sklepu močno sklicevalo na potrebno izvajanje pogodb v dobri veri, kot je predvideno v členu 26 VCLT (Linija proti Latviji, 2004).<br/><br/>Zaključek:<br/><br/>Iz zgoraj navedenega je jasno, da imajo pogodbe posebne zahteve, preden jih je mogoče šteti za samoizvršljive, vendar je ob upoštevanju vseh teh še vedno najpomembnejša razlaga nacionalnih sodišč. Nacionalna sodišča odločijo, ali se pogodba lahko imenuje samoizvršitev ali ne. Čeprav bi njihova ustava lahko vsebovala določbo, da je pogodbeno pravo najvišji zakon v državi, sodišča iz različnih držav razlagajo te določbe na različne načine. To je razvidno iz tega, kako ameriška in dominikanska ustava vsebujeta te določbe, vendar sledita popolnoma različni razlagi istega. Izraz "samoizvršitev" morda ni skladen s temi pogodbami, saj v praksi še vedno potrebujejo odobritev nacionalnih sodišč. V idealnem primeru bi morala biti pot naprej takšna, da države priznajo samoizvršljivost pogodb in jih obravnavajo tako, da se spoštujeta člena 26 in 27 VCLT. Ponovno, to je "idealna" situacija in je malo verjetno, da bi našli svojo pot v državni praksi nekaterih jurisdikcij v bližnji prihodnosti. Kljub temu je upanje mogoče pridobiti z obravnavo razlag nacionalnih sodišč, ki spoštujejo te norme, in upajmo, da bodo druga sodišča to priznala.<br/><br/>Reference:<br/><br/>Buergenthal, T. (1992).

| Behind-the-Scenes Tragedies That Affected the Cast of TV's Deadliest Catch<br/><br/>Lowered Fishing Quotas<br/><br/>Even though the crew on Deadliest Catch make the majority of their money from Discovery, that doesn't mean they don't actually sell their haul. So, you could say they have two sources of income, which is something that most people in their line of work don't have.<br/><br/>However, back in 2017, the Alaska Department of Fish and Game started a quota system, which limited the amount of fish any fishing boat could bring back to shore by half. That meant the crew on Deadliest Catch experienced a huge drop in profits for several years. Hey, at least they have Discovery to pay the bills, right? | Tragedije v ozadju, ki so prizadele igralce najsmrtonosnejšega ulova na televiziji<br/><br/>Znižane ribolovne kvote<br/><br/>Čeprav posadka na Deadliest Catch zasluži večino svojega denarja iz Discoveryja, to ne pomeni, da pravzaprav ne prodajajo svojega prevoza. Torej, lahko bi rekli, da imajo dva vira dohodka, kar je nekaj, česar večina ljudi v svojem poklicu nima.<br/><br/>Vendar pa je leta 2017 oddelek za ribe in divjad na Aljaski začel sistem kvot, ki je omejil količino rib, ki bi jo lahko ribiška ladja prinesla nazaj na obalo za polovico. To je pomenilo, da je posadka na Deadliest Catchu že nekaj let doživela velik padec dobička. |

Whether it is a last-minute job request or a paper that you forgot to write and it is due the next day, stress can always find a way into your day if you allow it. Today I will show you a few things you can do to eliminate or prevent stress.<br/><br/>The first thing you can do is to exercise. Exercising is a great way to relieve stress because it lowers the stress hormone in your body known as cortisol. The lower levels of cortisol in your body, the lower your stress level will be. Exercise can also increase your confidence, and when your confidence is up then your stress is usually down. For me, when I get stressed, I always exercise by going to the gym and practice boxing, it helps me burn calories and reduce stress while having fun.<br/><br/>Writing things down has been a way to calm people down for a very long time, and it is the next topic on our list. Writing down what is making you stressed is a way to clear the mind, and it helps get rid of stress as well. I have a similar experience when writing stories, usually if I cannot think of a new idea because of an old one, I will write the old idea down and think on it. That is when new ideas start to spring up and I can continue writing normally. It is the same with stress. Think about a stream it continues to flow down it's path until it hits a beaver dam, and that dam blocks the flow of water and everything starts to build up. The only way to get the water flow back to normal is to remove the dam. This is where writing comes in. When you write it down, you are removing stress piece by piece until you can think normally again.<br/><br/>Stress can come into our lives through doors in our life that we keep open. Procrastination is a way that we can leave the doors open for stress. Waiting until tomorrow may be fun for today, but it will hurt you tomorrow, and is a very short-sighted solution. The longer you wait to do something, the larger that something becomes, and the larger it becomes the more stress you will be inviting into your life. Taking care of something as soon as we receive it is a great way to prevent stress, but it is something that takes great discipline to do. The more you cut Procrastination out of your life, the more stress free you will be. So shut that door, you're letting all the cold air out.<br/><br/>So let's review: Exercise, Write down what is stressing you, and Do not Procrastinate. These are only a few ways to relieve stress but to me, they are the most effective. While I know these may not work for everyone I would like to invite anyone feeling stressed to research how to get rid of it. | BLOGI<br/><br/>Oglejte si našo zbirko blogov, ki so jih napisali sodelavci.<br/><br/>INFORMATIVNI BLOGI<br/><br/>Ne stresajte ga<br/><br/>Poročilo<br/>Kristen Hogan<br/>&#124; Nov 12, 2020<br/><br/>Stres, ne glede na to, kako velike stvari se dogajajo, lahko vedno najde način, da dvigne svojo grdo glavo. Ne glede na to, ali gre za prošnjo za delo v zadnjem trenutku ali papir, ki ste ga pozabili napisati in je zaradi naslednjega dne, stres lahko vedno najde pot v svoj dan, če to dovolite. Danes vam bomo pokazali nekaj stvari, ki jih lahko storite za odpravo ali preprečevanje stresa.<br/><br/>Prva stvar, ki jo lahko storite, je vadba. Vadba je odličen način za lajšanje stresa, saj znižuje stresni hormon v telesu, znan kot kortizol. Nižja raven kortizola v telesu, nižja bo vaša raven stresa. Vaja lahko poveča tudi vaše zaupanje, in ko je vaša samozavest gor, potem je vaš stres ponavadi dol. Zame, ko sem pod stresom, vedno vadim tako, da grem v telovadnico in vadim boks, mi pomaga, da gorijo kalorije in zmanjšajo stres, medtem ko se zabavajo.<br/><br/>Pisanje stvari navzdol je bil način, da se ljudje umirijo za zelo dolgo časa, in to je naslednja tema na našem seznamu. Pisanje navzdol, kaj je zaradi česar ste pod stresom je način, da počistite um, in to pomaga znebiti stresa, kot tudi. Podobne izkušnje imam pri pisanju zgodb, ponavadi, če se ne morem spomniti nove ideje zaradi stare, bom staro idejo napisal in razmišljal o njej. Takrat se začnejo pojavljati nove ideje in lahko nadaljujem s pisanjem normalno. Enako je s stresom. Pomislite na tok, ki še naprej teče navzdol po svoji poti, dokler ne zadene jezu bobra, in ta jez blokira pretok vode in vse se začne kopičiti. Edini način, da se pretok vode vrne v normalno stanje, je odstraniti jez. Ko ga zapišete, odstranite stresni del po delih, dokler ne boste spet lahko normalno razmišljali.<br/><br/>Stres lahko vstopijo v naše življenje skozi vrata v našem življenju, da smo odprti. Odlašanje je način, da lahko pustimo vrata odprta za stres. Čakanje na jutri je lahko zabavno za danes, vendar vas bo jutri prizadelo in je zelo kratkovidna rešitev. Dlje ko čakate, da nekaj storite, večje je, da nekaj postane, in večje postane, več stresa boste vabili v svoje življenje. Skrb za nekaj takoj, ko prejmemo, je odličen način za preprečevanje stresa, vendar je to nekaj, kar zahteva veliko disciplino. Bolj kot boste izrezali odlašanje iz svojega življenja, več stresa boste brez. Zapri vrata, da ne bo več mrzlega zraka.<br/><br/>Torej, pregledajmo: Vaja, Zapišite, kaj vas stresa, in ne odlašajte. To je le nekaj načinov za lajšanje stresa, vendar so zame najučinkovitejši. Čeprav vem, da to morda ne bo delovalo za vsakogar, bi rad povabil vsakogar, ki se počuti pod stresom, da razišče, kako se ga znebiti. |
