| Sleep Clinic<br/><br/>The sleep disorders program evaluates and treats children and adults affected by sleep-related problems such as insomnia, sleep apnea, narcolepsy and other hypersomnias, parasomnias and night time enuresis. The residents see patients during sleep disorders clinic hours.<br/><br/>During this rotation, the residents are exposed to a wide variety of sleep disorders. They are trained to investigate and evaluate their own patient care experiences pertaining to sleep evaluations with appraisal and assimilation of current scientific evidence. The residents work closely with sleep disorder faculty physicians and acquire the skills to formulate and communicate with patients and families about their diagnostic assessment and management plan, including neuropharmacology. Providing care plans to other physicians and care providers either verbally or via letter/note is an integral part of the program. | Sleep Clinic<br/><br/>Program motenj spanja ocenjuje in zdravi otroke in odrasle, ki jih prizadenejo težave, povezane s spanjem, kot so nespečnost, apneja v spanju, narkolepsija in druge hipersomnije, parasomnije in nočna enureza.

| Truly Handsfree Bluetooth Headset Takes Voice Commands<br/><br/>Most Bluetooth headsets are perfectly capable of the voice dial thing, assuming that the connected mobile phone can do it, but the BlueAnt V1 takes voice control to a new high. The incredibly compact Bluetooth headset is being marketed as the first ever with a true voice-based user interface.<br/><br/>Instead of clicking a physical button to answer your calls, you simply speak into the microphone and say "accept call". Other basic voice commands could include "volume up", "reject call", or "do the laundry". Okay, maybe it won't do that last thing, but you can see how a completely handsfree experience like that offered by the BlueAnt V1 can be excellent for drivers and other people who need their hands. That is why you're using a Bluetooth headset in the first place.<br/><br/>The downside is that the voice control can be "wonky" and it can be quite frustrating when you accidentally give it a command that you don't want it to do. What happens if you're in a call with someone and you happens to say "end call"? | Resnično Handsfree Bluetooth slušalke vzame glasovne ukaze<br/><br/>Večina slušalk Bluetooth je popolnoma sposobna za glasovno klicanje, ob predpostavki, da lahko to stori povezani mobilni telefon, vendar BlueAnt V1 vzame glasovni nadzor na novo visoko. Neverjetno kompaktne slušalke Bluetooth se tržijo kot prve z resničnim uporabniškim vmesnikom, ki temelji na glasu.<br/><br/>Namesto da kliknete fizični gumb za odgovor na vaše klice, preprosto govorite v mikrofon in rečete "sprejmi klic". Drugi osnovni glasovni ukazi lahko vključujejo "glasnost", "zavrni klic" ali "pranje perila". Ok, morda ne bo naredil zadnje stvari, vendar lahko vidite, kako je lahko popolnoma brezžična izkušnja, kot jo ponuja BlueAnt V1, odlična za voznike in druge ljudi, ki potrebujejo svoje roke. To je razlog, zakaj uporabljate Bluetooth slušalke na prvem mestu.<br/><br/>Slaba stran je, da je glasovni nadzor lahko "neprijeten" in je lahko precej frustrirajoč, ko mu po nesreči date ukaz, ki ga ne želite storiti. Kaj se zgodi, če ste v klicu z nekom in se zgodi, da rečete "konec klica"? |
| Wednesday, July 06, 2005<br/><br/>Going to college? DREAM on<br/><br/>Here is another great article about our failing (and increasingly ridiculous) immigration system, this time from the Boston Globe. A 18-year undocumented immigrant from Massachusetts was awarded a four-year scholarship at any state university because of her high test scores, but this was later rescinded once state officials found out about her immigration status. As the author of the article so rightly says,<br/><br/>"So much for celebrating the building blocks for success and the American dream. Romney says, tough luck if you are smart, hardworking, and the child of illegal immigrants."<br/><br/>It's beyond me why anyone wants to keep smart, high-achieving kids like this one out of college. Does anybody really think that denying in-state tuition and scholarships to undocumented immigrants will make any potential immigrants think twice about coming here to work? Or are policies like these motivated by fear? Despite the increasingly widespread movement in favor of the DREAM Act and state laws (see this previous post) to allow undocumented students to pay in-state tuition, it seems like the power of fear is growing.<br/><br/>It's interesting that Mass. Gov. Romney is bashing undocumented immigrants now - this article in the Economist shows how his campaign to end gay marriage in Massachusetts is closely linked to his anticipated run for the presidency in 2008. Here in New York, presumed Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton has gone to the right on immigration, claiming that she is "adamantly against illegal immigrants." It's unfortunate that the way to get ahead in politics (particularly in the red states) is to blame immigrants for our problems. It will be interesting to see if an increased Latino turnout in places like the Southwest will prove Hillary wrong.<br/><br/>3 comments:<br/><br/>Maybe people do not want illegal aliens to get scholarhips for the following reasons:<br/><br/>1. Their parents violated the law to enter the country. 2. Their parents had to steal someone's identity to work in this country. 3. Their parents have to cheat on their income taxes (and other taxes) to stay here. 4. Their parents had to lie to get their children admitted. 5. their parents lied on applications for things like free lunch.<br/><br/>First, the Supreme Court ruled in 1982 that all children have the right to public education regardless of immigration status. Schools are prohibited from asking about a child's immigration status, meaning that undocumented parents do not have to "lie" to get their kids free lunch.<br/><br/>Second, many immigrants do not have to use another identity or cheat on income taxes in order to work here -- many employers knowingly hire undocumented immigrants (this has been happening for some time - the 1986 Imm. Reform and Control Act's attempted to deal with it, and many anti-immigrant advocates argue that employer sanctions need to be strengthened today) and quite a few immigrants pay income taxes and other taxes that they never end up receiving the benefits of (the New York Times reported that illegal immigrants provide social security with a subsidy of $7 billion a year).<br/><br/>Finally, if the biggest problem with undocumented immigrants is that they are breaking the law by being here, should that same standard be applied to businesses that knowingly hire them (which, by the way, is also against the law even though it is rarely enforced)? Should the kids of these businesspeople be denied the same opportunities because their parents broke the law? Could we extend this argument to the children of everyone who has ever broken the law in this country?<br/><br/>Whatever you think about illegal immigration, the point is that the kids should not be punished for their parents' decisions to come here. Especially when these bright and hardworking undocumented students have the potential to contribute so much to our society. | sreda, julij 06, 2005<br/><br/>Greš na kolidž? SANJAJ<br/><br/>Tukaj je še en odličen članek o našem neuspešnem (in vse bolj smešnem) imigracijskem sistemu, tokrat iz Bostonskega globusa. 18-letna neprijavljena priseljenka iz Massachusettsa je zaradi visokih rezultatov testov prejela štiriletno štipendijo na kateri koli državni univerzi, vendar je bila ta kasneje preklicana, ko so državni uradniki izvedeli za njen priseljenski status. Kot pravi avtor članka,<br/><br/>"Toliko za praznovanje gradnikov za uspeh in ameriške sanje. Romney pravi, težko srečo, če ste pametni, trdo delati, in otrok nezakonitih priseljencev."<br/><br/>Ne vem, zakaj bi kdorkoli rad obdržal pametne, visoko uspešne otroke, kot je ta, zunaj kolidža. Ali kdo res misli, da bo zavrnitev državne šolnine in štipendij za neprijavljene priseljence povzročila, da bodo potencialni priseljenci dvakrat razmislili o prihodu sem na delo? Ali so politike, kot so te, motivirane s strahom? Kljub vse bolj razširjenemu gibanju v korist zakona DREAM in državnih zakonov (glej to prejšnjo objavo), ki omogočajo študentom brez dokumentov, da plačajo šolnino v državi, se zdi, da moč strahu narašča.<br/><br/>Zanimivo je, da guverner Romney zdaj pretepa neprijavljene priseljence - ta članek v Economistu kaže, kako je njegova kampanja za odpravo istospolnih porok v Massachusettsu tesno povezana z njegovim pričakovanim predsedniškim mandatom leta 2008. Tukaj v New Yorku je domnevna demokratska predsednica Hillary Clinton šla na desno glede priseljevanja in trdila, da je "odkrito proti nezakonitim priseljencem". Žalostno je, da je način, kako napredovati v politiki (zlasti v rdečih državah), da za naše težave krivimo priseljence. Zanimivo bo videti, ali bo povečana latino udeležba v krajih, kot je jugozahod, dokazala, da se Hillary moti.<br/><br/>3 komentarji:<br/><br/>Morda ljudje ne želijo, da bi nezakoniti tujci dobili stipendijo iz naslednjih razlogov:<br/><br/>1. Njihovi starši so kršili zakon, da bi vstopili v državo. 2. Njihovi starši so morali ukrasti identiteto nekoga, da bi delali v tej državi. 3. Njihovi starši morajo goljufati na svojih davkih na dohodek (in drugih davkih), da ostanejo tukaj. 4. Njihovi starši so morali lagati, da so njihovi otroci sprejeli. 5. njihovi starši so lagali o vlogah za stvari, kot je brezplačno kosilo.<br/><br/>Prvo, vrhovno sodišče je leta 1982 odločilo, da imajo vsi otroci pravico do javnega izobraževanja ne glede na priseljenski status. Šolam je prepovedano spraševati o otrokovem imigracijskem statusu, kar pomeni, da staršem brez dokumentov ni treba "lagati", da bi svojim otrokom dobili brezplačno kosilo.<br/><br/>Drugič, mnogim priseljencem ni treba uporabljati druge identitete ali goljufati na dohodninskih davkih, da bi delali tukaj - mnogi delodajalci zavestno najemajo neprijavljene priseljence (to se že nekaj časa dogaja - 1986 Imm. Zakon o reformi in nadzoru se je poskušal ukvarjati z njim, in mnogi zagovorniki proti priseljencem trdijo, da je treba danes okrepiti sankcije delodajalca) in precej priseljencev plačati dohodnine in druge davke, ki jih nikoli ne prejmejo ugodnosti (New York Times je poročal, da nezakoniti priseljenci zagotavljajo socialno varnost s subvencijo v višini 7 milijard dolarjev na leto).<br/><br/>Nazadnje, če je največji problem pri priseljencih brez dokumentov to, da s tem, ko so tu, kršijo zakon, ali naj se ta isti standard uporablja za podjetja, ki jih zavestno najamejo (kar je, mimogrede, tudi v nasprotju z zakonom, čeprav se le redko uveljavlja)? Ali bi morali otrokom teh poslovnežev odvzeti enake možnosti, ker so njihovi starši prekršili zakon? Ali bi lahko ta argument razširili na otroke vseh, ki so kdaj prekršili zakon v tej državi?<br/><br/>Karkoli mislite o nezakonitem priseljevanju, bistvo je, da otroci ne bi smeli biti kaznovani za odločitve svojih staršev, da pridejo sem. Še posebej, ko imajo ti svetli in marljivi študenti brez dokumentov potencial, da toliko prispevajo k naši družbi. |

| ΑΛΗΘΩΣ<br/><br/>Corporations are not people and money is not speech<br/><br/>In Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned century-old restrictions on corporate spending in elections under the guise of protecting First Amendment free speech rights. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, writing for the majority, said, "If the First Amendment has any force, it prohibits Congress from fining or jailing citizens, or associations of citizens, for simply engaging in political speech." This argument of the majority decision rests on the notions that corporations are covered by the same free speech protections as individual citizens and that campaign donations or financing are the same as speech.<br/><br/>Corporations, however, are inherently not the same as individuals and thus cannot have the same protections as individuals. There are a slew of laws that protect corporations and their interests in the arena for which they are by definition formed—namely the marketplace. The laws that govern corporations and the rights enjoyed by them are distinct from the laws and rights of individuals. A corporation, for example, can enter into contracts like an individual, but unlike an individual, a corporation's members can be protected by limited liability so their personal assets are not at stake.<br/><br/>If a corporation, then, is a distinct legal entity governed by different laws than an individual is, corporations are not protected under the First Amendment in the same way that individuals are protected. Corporations, especially in their most powerful and wealthy incarnations, are exponentially more influential than most individuals in America. The restrictions on corporate spending in elections that were overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court were meant to redress this power balance between average individuals and unduly influential businesses. Corporations already have a plethora of ways to influence politics, from political action committees to lobbyists on Capitol Hill. The framers of the Bill of Rights wanted to protect the voices of the trampled, not amplify the voices of the elite.<br/><br/>The other part of the Supreme Court's premise for its decision is that the First Amendment free speech clause applies to campaign funding. While speech can be interpreted loosely as any form of expression, such an open, ambiguous definition would create a myriad of problems with all kinds of laws. An architect has a vision of a building: it is his art, his self expression, yet he cannot ignore local zoning laws that, for instance, restrict the height of his building. Should he sue the state for violation of his free speech, his right to expression? Equating money with speech also opens the door to sundry ludicrous claims by, for instance, an employer who objects to minimum wage laws since he'd like to express that his employees are only worth paying $3 an hour. There have to be restrictions on what constitutes speech to prevent a bastardization of the term and an overly liberal interpretation of the First Amendment.<br/><br/>A corporation already has the power to issue a statement in favor of a candidate or policy through its political action committees, and individual members of a business are welcome to contribute money as well. However, allowing a corporation to use its vast profits to directly finance the election or to remove a candidate compromises the democratic notion of a free and fair election. There are unseemly ties even now between politicians and various industries, but this new ruling would make such connections more robust and give them a veneer of legitimacy. A politician financed by a business would become completely beholden to its political agenda and not to the voters.<br/><br/>It's not only the independence of politicians that's at stake, but also the independence of our judges, who are at the very least expected to be impartial. Many states still use elections to appoint judges, which leaves them vulnerable to the influence of political spending. In a recent speech at a law school conference, former Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor worried about the impact of corporate campaign funding in judicial elections, saying that "judicial campaigning makes last week's decision in Citizens United an increasing problem for maintaining an independent judiciary."<br/><br/>Two cornerstones of our democracy—free elections and an independent judiciary—are threatened by the Supreme Court's activist and meddling decision. The case could have been decided much more narrowly in favor of Citizens United, but instead, the majority of the justices decided to expand the case to champion the rights of big money over the interest of the American people. Senators Dick Durbin (D-IL) and Arlen Specter (D-PA) introduced the Fair Elections Now Act last March. It would prohibit contributions from political action committees and would match individual donations, limited to $100, on a 4:1 basis so that fundraising focuses on the people. Such a system has been in place in New York City since the 1988 Campaign Finance Act. The rest of the country is long overdue to follow. Never before has the fight for public financing been more necessary.<br/><br/>The author is a Columbia College junior majoring in political science. She is a prospective law student.<br/><br/>The 14th amendment, which was one of the Reconstruction amendments added following the War of Northern Aggression was never legally ratified by the States and has caused more problems than all the other post-war amendments combined. If my memory serves me right, corporations were declared by the Supreme Court to be 14th Amemdment citizens during the late 1800s or early 1900s. In case you are unfamiliar with the wording of this amendment, it basically made everyone a citizen (and subject) of the United States. Prior to the War, all individuals were citizens of the State within which they resided and no one was a citizen of the United States nor were they subject to the jurisdiction of the United States except for those who resided in the District of Columbia or resided within one of the territories under the jurisdiction of the United States. The main purposes of the War of Northern Aggression was to destroy the soverienty of the individual States and reduce the status of every American to that of a subject under the control and jurisdiction of the United States government. The founding fathers set up our government as a loose confederation of Sovereign States with the States exercising all meaningful polical power. They never invisioned or intended any effective political power to reside in Washington. Things will only get much worse until We the People throw the theives and money changers out of Washington and restore our government back to what it once was.<br/><br/>The word person means corporation in law. It is not that corporations are not people, it is that people are not corporations. We have been tricked into accepting a corporate identity[ALL CAPS]. Look at your drivers license. Every time we go to court,we go as a corporation, not as a natural person.The first corporations were governments. Looked at logically, limited liability for a corporation is the extension of sovereign immunity to the king after he was no longer king. The same ruling elite families are still in control and that goes all the way back to the first known about extraterrestrials[anunaki] that the Sumerian documents talk about.The same group also take the credit or blame for all the religions and secret societies.<br/><br/>What difference does it make? Really. Think about it, the whole entire Congress and Senate are a dog and pony show, the real power brokers who control it all are in the shadows, working the deals, doing what they want, with the AL-CIA-DA and MOSSAD out there killing everyone who disagrees with these shadow government assholes who truly run it all.<br/><br/>So, why is it so important now to be so upset over this shit? Why now? After more than two hundred years of absolute proof that the politicians are just a fancy hand puppet show to distract us from the REAL WHEELING AND DEALING IN THE BACK ROOMS elsewhere, why does it matter now that the total contempt of democracy is being demonstrated by SCOTUS in this ruling? The assholes on this court know that the real guys with their hands on the power levers of the system aren't in the Congress and the Senate.<br/><br/>When the Rule of Law became OBSOLETE in the world, in general, and everything became more or less ROLLERBALL only this time, on STEROIDS, for and by the CORPORATIONS, why did this sole ruling make all that much difference? Why do all of you assholes think that this 'lagging' indicator of the end of any semblances of democratic government makes any difference.<br/><br/>Hypothetically, let's say this ruling had not happened. Do any of you think that the corporations and the moneyed influences in the shadows wouldn't have continued to exert any and all of their will on the rest of us?<br/><br/>For those of you who think it'd been different, I suggest you find a remedy to your TOTAL NAIVETE!!!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>this ruling didn't make one iota of a difference. It was always like this, long before SCOTUS basically said to corporations; "go ahead, do what the fuck you want…the little people are just cannon fodder for your wars, chattel for you to barter and sell at your leisure.."<br/><br/>democracy was always an illusion. We never ever had any control, ever. making such a mountain out of this mole hill is absolutely unwarranted, in light of the fact that for the whole entire 230 year history of this republic, the fat cats and the rich oligarchs never needed any Congress or Senate to do what they pleased, under any circumstances, ever. They just did it.<br/><br/>The government you were looking at was a chimera, not real..<br/><br/>the sooner you all come to that realization, the sooner we can get on with less pissing and moaning over a mere joke of a technicality that was always the case from day one, and was not foisted on us by the SCOTUS, the court only quite belatedly declared to us what has been happening for a long long long, corrupt time.<br/><br/>I've got a mad crush on Exxon, and Exxon has one on me, wedding bells in the spring – a bit quick I know, but our love can't be denied. Exxon is a little shy, so don't expect any public announcements, we're thinking a quiet wedding in Reno.<br/><br/>Any business is simply a group of individuals (small or large) exercising their individual rights collectively. Therefore, any business has the same rights as those individuals (except, of course, the right to vote, which is reserved to the individuals themselves). The freedom to dispose of one's wealth as one sees fit comes along with the freedom to earn it. If an aggregate of individuals has earned money, it should be free to decide how do dispose of that money. The real problem is not that businesses can donate to campaigns, it is that the government has been allowed to meddle in business – i.e. that the government can grant some favor in return for that money. We need separation of commerce and state in the same way and for the same reasons as we have separation of church and state. I also find it interesting that the author chose as examples two laws (zoning and minimum wage) that also violate individual rights. The first violates property rights and the second violates the rights of individuals to contract freely.<br/><br/>under your jackoffian analysis, nobody should interfere with anything anyone does at all. say, if I were in a crowd, with a saturday night special, and I want to 'free speech' your butt with it much in the same way the CIA free speeched Bobby Kennedy in L.A. one night, that's fine, because to interfere with me is interfering with my right to free speech you.<br/><br/>that's the critical flaw with you libertarian assholes….you think that there is no societal role for any rule of law, that anything that fits under 'ends justify means' rationale shouldn't ever be interfered with, just let everyone do whatever they so choose, and it all works out. That Ayn Rand bullshit doesn't work, dude! It works right up to the point where someone else pays a price for your 'whatever i wanna do' freedom crosses a line and then interfere with my freedom.<br/><br/>rules and laws SHOULD exist in the framework of society strictly to keep in check that good old "I can do anything I want to and it's just me being free" line of horse shit.<br/><br/>Corporations do not have any rights, dorkus! globally, they have been the reason why there are so many failed states, pillaged by the will of corporatocrats based in the U.S.S.A. who think that freedom of their speech translates into; "do what we tell you or we'll bomb you to get your resources we need" kind of raping and pillaging.<br/><br/>someday, I hope some asshole fucks you with their 'free speech' and then we'll hear your sorry ass whine about how the law let you down. What law? In your libertarian world of 'I can do what I want', the only rule of law is the one you make up to justify your end goal. For you then, it'll be fun to see how you cope with some other asshole's interpretation of your boundary being just a little bit of a mere inconvenience for his goals, which didn't necessarily respect your boundaries at all, for damned sure!<br/><br/>Someone by the name of "uh huh, right.." might have a logical point hidden in the forest of name-calling and straw-man abuse, but how about this: Corporations are inventions of the State that are created to pass some of the risks of doing business from the people running the business over to the stockholders (if any), the customers (if any) and the public. So if a corporation commits a fraud, it is the corporation that's punished (usually) and fined and the people who run the corporation get to walk away with a golden handshake. And the cost of the fine is passed along to the customers and paid to the government (not the victims!). To "David"s point, if we were to separate government and commerce, corporations would cease to exist! Not a bad idea.<br/><br/>I think that the point is, that if a corporation commits a financial crime, and nobody notices (the if the tree falls in the forest and nobody hears it, did it truly make a noise argument) then did a crime actually take place?<br/><br/>and in a veitch diagram, where the two blobs collide and interact, if one encroaches on the other one's boundary, who is the arbiter of who got violated?<br/><br/>my point is this: there are no straw man arguments with regard to david's asinine assessment that corporations can do whatever they want with abandon. the truth of the matter is, granting corporations, and oligarchs, or whomever, a license to do what they want, whenever they want, under the premise that THEY ARE INDIVIDUALS and hence, guaranteed FREE SPEECH, is both absurd and horse shit.<br/><br/>corporations are made up of groups of people. people who should live by some semblance of Rule of Law. When they don't have to, then it's "I can do anything I want as long as nobody catches me or holds me accountable for my transgressions" going on here.<br/><br/>if that's the world David wants to live in, let him go there and make it happen, but goddamn it, don't expect me not to fucking object to that shit!<br/><br/>We can all get along, just as long as boundaries are not gratuitously violated at will by anyone who thinks their right to do what they want actually nullifies my right not to be interfered with by their actions.<br/><br/>with regard to corporations, they have no right to violate my rights, or yours, or anyone elses. If they can't function in the community as a benevolent and hence, non interfering entity, then they have no right to exist.<br/><br/>and David wasn't being threatened. he's an asshole for asserting that "do what you want, it's freedom of speech" is a bunch of horse shit. It's la la land bullshit. And I object to anyone or anything violating my boundaries with that free speech assertion. That's a crock of shit and you know it is!<br/><br/>Well, that was a colorful response. Sadly, "uh-uh", you are way off the mark. I never said people have the right to infringe on anyone else's rights…and I repudiate "ends justify the means" thinking. Yes, laws SHOULD exist, but ONLY to PROTECT the rights of people. I'm sorry you have such a warped and horribly incorrect view of my argument.<br/><br/>your point well taken, David. I apologize for peeing in your corn flakes. I think I thought you were inferring that corporations were able to do whatever they pleased under this right of FREEDOM OF SPEECH, which in Amerk'a is a joke today because the PATRIOT ACT and a non-declared state of MARTIAL LAW we've been living under since Sept. 2001, has given the government the ability to suspend and or 'shred' the U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights.<br/><br/>sadly, people have only a few rights. we have the right to be taxed to the point of absurdity. we have the right to be conscripted and become cannon fodder for oligarch wars. and we have the right to shut the fuck up and be quiet while we are being joy boinked by corporations and oligarchs and bankers. those are our rights, and sadly, they truly SUCKETH, David. I think we can agree on that!<br/><br/>I'm still wondering how the newbie, Roberts, inherited the Chief Justiceship after Rhenquist rather than that role going to someone with more experience on the bench. What does "The Roberts Court" plan to do next, though, for corporations? Give them the right to vote at the polls like real people?; perhaps have votes by human beings counted as 3/5 of a person or less to their 1?<br/><br/>I haven't read all of the 183-page booklength "ruling" yet but find these appalling statements therein to be not only contradictory to their expansive actions in this case but also something of an abdication of their duty:<br/><br/>"the gravest and most delicate duty that this Court is called upon to perform." Blodgett v. Holden, 275 U. S. 142, 147–148 (1927) (Holmes, J., concurring). Because the stakes are so high, our standard practice is to refrain from addressing constitutional questions except when necessary to rule on particular claims before us. See Ashwander v. TVA, 297 U. S. 288, 346–348 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concur-ring). This policy underlies both our willingness to construe ambiguous statutes to avoid constitutional problems and our practice "'never to formulate a rule of constitutional law broader than is required by the precise facts to which it is to be applied.'" United States v. Raines, 362<br/>U. S. 17, 21 (1960) (quoting Liverpool, New York & Philadelphia S. S. Co. v. Commissioners of Emigration, 113<br/>U. S. 33, 39 (1885)).<br/>The majority and dissent are united in expressing allegiance to these principles. Ante, at 12; post, at 14 (STEVENS, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). >><br/><br/>Roberts, by virtue of his lies during CONfirmation by the DEMS who shoved his lying ass thru the process at mach speed, needs to be 'impeached' for being a fucking liar. He specifically stated he would not go this route of writing decisions not based on settled, non controversial concepts of the U.S. Constitution…and here clearly he has done exactly the opposite of that.<br/><br/>The real blame should be on the shoulders of the cocksuckers in the SENATE that confirmed the son of a bitch in the first place, stating they wouldn't vote against his confirmation because they were saving their ammo for REAL THREATS TO US..<br/><br/>I blame the fucking DINOCRATS more than I blame this lying pile of shit named Roberts. Pricks like SCHUMER and that other asshole from Illinois, and that lying zionist bastard Levin from Michigan. Just a couple of them holding their ground could have stopped the confirmation of Alito, and then Roberts. But they let it slide.<br/><br/>the assertion that all of this is indeed window dressing is a correct one, and the truth is, though blatantly a violation of our rights across the board, these scum in the SCOTUS are only post fact, asserting the screwing they were doing to us for a long, long, long time.<br/><br/>the truth is, it never mattered what we thought was going on, because Corporations have been functioning well outside the law for a long time now, and nobody has held them accountable. the very bastards that sit on the SCOTUS are benefactors of the wrongdoing and greed of the corporations who provide kickbacks to them for their decisions, in the form of STOCK DIVIDENDS.<br/><br/>unfortunately, focusing on the corrupt SCOTUS doesn't help us much. It's like stating the obvious, and expecting it to be punishable, when it is not.<br/><br/>we are fucked no matter how we look at it, but there will be a day of atonement. Once they take away every last vestige of personal dignity of the entire middle class in this country, there will be hell to pay. There will be a violent, bloody backlash the likes of which has only been seen in France, but eventually will come home to roost here.<br/><br/>Communists have long been in the business of fomenting class war along economic lines and brackets. Try to think more in terms of the Constitutionalist Class than the "middle class" as their linguists prefer. Works better, imo, to throw them off their gameplans.<br/><br/>what is happening now is a quickening in the realization by the Sheeple that something is seriously wrong, and that the facade and the illusion are wearing thin and falling down, revealing the ugly, multi tentacled ROTHSCHILD beast behind the corporatocracy push for more power and absolute rule.<br/><br/>as the 'middle class' or whatever you want to call it, gets increasingly decimated and destroyed, ultimately enough Sheeple will have awakened to the point where they realize it's either stand up and fight or die on all fours.<br/><br/>the system ROTHSCHILDS is collapsing in on itself, due to way too much out of control, unchecked GREED, and now, it's like a tall building going back and forth like a pendulum in an earthquake, at some point it will finally 'snap' and fall. we're in the end game, as you will, of democracy and the faux economic system that was being perpetrated upon everyone, so there's a collision with REALITY about to happen pretty soon, and it will not be pretty.<br/><br/>IF I were SCOTUS, I'd be making sure those biz jets are fueled, pilots standing by, for their final PARAGUAYAN trip to the Bush compound where they'll hide once the balloon finally goes up here.<br/><br/>but increasingly, it looks like they're pushing hard for World War III to take everyone's eyes off the mind blowing, incredible HUBRIS of their ilk.<br/><br/>a day of reckoning is indeed coming.

Sounds like Treason to me.<br/><br/>In my own idea and understanding there have to be restrictions on what constitutes speech to prevent a bastardization of the term and an overly liberal interpretation of the First Amendment..Great post!!<br/><br/>4 We need not reach the question whether the Government has a compelling interest in preventing foreign individuals or associations from influencing our Nation's political process. Cf. 2 U. S. C. §441e (contribution and expenditure ban applied to "foreign national[s]"). Section 441b is not limited to corporations or associations that were created in foreign countries or funded predominantly by foreign shareholders. Section 441b therefore would be overbroad even if we assumed, arguendo, that the Government has a compelling interest in limiting foreign influence over our political process. See Broadrick, 413<br/>U. S., at 615. >><br/><br/>The US went bankrupt when FDR called in the gold. We had no more gold to pay for the paper we borrowed from the FED. It is now in a yearly bankruptcy rollover. The government is now private like BLACKWATER. All government agencies are listed on DUNN AND BRADSTREET. The common law which the constitution specifies pertains to natural people. All business by the courts today is corporate meaning that we are viewed as individual corporations. We exist by contract with the state. Remember the 14th amendment. There were no US citizens before that. Most of us have unwittingly claimed US corporate citizenship. We need to address the rule by the banking elite.Almost all leading REPS and DEMS are members of the COUNCIL OF FOREIGN RELATIONS or the TLC. LOok up the history of who started and controls these. Rush, Glenn and Sean are all liars and banker bootlickers. Obama is a puppet for the CFR. 911 truth has a great deal more bearing and would serve to unite the honest people in this country.<br/><br/>I don't really believe I'm a corporation or the citizen of one but, if the gubbermint thinks so, does the SCOTUS ruling mean that there are no more campaign contribution limits on anyone, businesses or individuals? I'd rather see money removed from our electoral process altogether — equal time on America's airwaves given at no charge for all candidates | ΑΛΗΘΩΣ<br/><br/>Korporacije niso ljudje in denar ni govor.<br/><br/>V primeru Citizens United proti Zvezni volilni komisiji je ameriško vrhovno sodišče razveljavilo stoletne omejitve porabe podjetij na volitvah pod krinko zaščite pravic do svobode govora. Sodnik Anthony M. Kennedy, ki je pisal za večino, je dejal: "Če ima prvi amandma kakršno koli moč, prepoveduje kongresu, da kaznuje ali zapira državljane ali združenja državljanov, ker se preprosto ukvarjajo s političnim govorom." Ta argument večinske odločitve temelji na prepričanju, da so korporacije zajete z enako zaščito svobode govora kot posamezni državljani in da so donacije ali financiranje kampanj enake kot govor.<br/><br/>Vendar pa korporacije po svoji naravi niso enake posameznikom in zato ne morejo imeti enake zaščite kot posamezniki. Obstaja množica zakonov, ki ščitijo korporacije in njihove interese v areni, za katero so po definiciji oblikovani - in sicer na trgu. Zakoni, ki urejajo korporacije, in pravice, ki jih imajo, se razlikujejo od zakonov in pravic posameznikov. Družba lahko na primer sklene pogodbe kot posameznik, vendar za razliko od posameznika lahko člani družbe zaščitijo z omejeno odgovornostjo, tako da njihovo osebno premoženje ni ogroženo.<br/><br/>Če je korporacija ločena pravna oseba, ki jo ureja drugačna zakonodaja kot posameznik, potem korporacije niso zaščitene po Prvem amandmaju na enak način, kot so zaščitene posamezniki. Korporacije, zlasti v svojih najmočnejših in najbogatejših inkarnacijah, so eksponentno bolj vplivne kot večina posameznikov v Ameriki. Omejitve porabe podjetij na volitvah, ki jih je razveljavilo ameriško vrhovno sodišče, so bile namenjene temu ravnovesju moči med povprečnimi posamezniki in neupravičeno vplivnimi podjetji. Korporacije že imajo številne načine vplivanja na politiko, od političnih akcijskih odborov do lobistov na Capitol Hillu. Pripravljavci zakona o pravicah so želeli zaščititi glasove pohabljenih, ne pa okrepiti glasove elite.<br/><br/>Drugi del predpostavke vrhovnega sodišča za svojo odločitev je, da se klavzula o svobodi govora prvega amandmaja uporablja za financiranje kampanj. Medtem ko se govor lahko razlaga ohlapno kot katera koli oblika izražanja, bi takšna odprta, dvoumna definicija ustvarila nešteto težav z vsemi vrstami zakonov. Arhitekt ima vizijo stavbe: to je njegova umetnost, njegovo samoizražanje, vendar ne more prezreti lokalnih zakonov o prostorskem načrtovanju, ki na primer omejujejo višino njegove stavbe. Ali naj toži državo zaradi kršitve njegove svobode govora, njegove pravice do izražanja? Izenačevanje denarja z govorom tudi odpira vrata različnim smešnim trditvam delodajalca, ki nasprotuje zakonom o minimalni plači, saj bi rad izrazil, da so njegovi zaposleni vredni samo 3 dolarje na uro. Obstajati morajo omejitve glede tega, kaj je govor, da bi preprečili bastardizacijo izraza in preveč liberalno razlago Prvega amandmaja.<br/><br/>Korporacija ima že pooblastilo, da prek svojih odborov za politično ukrepanje izda izjavo v korist kandidata ali politike, posamezni člani podjetja pa so dobrodošli, da prispevajo tudi denar. Vendar pa omogočanje korporacijam, da svoje ogromne dobičke uporabijo za neposredno financiranje volitev ali odstranitev kandidata, ogroža demokratično idejo svobodnih in poštenih volitev. Tudi zdaj obstajajo neprimerne vezi med politiki in različnimi panogami, vendar bi ta nova sodba takšne povezave okrepila in jim dala lupino legitimnosti. Politik, ki ga financira podjetje, bi postal popolnoma zavezan svojemu političnemu programu in ne volivcem.<br/><br/>Ne gre le za neodvisnost politikov, ampak tudi za neodvisnost naših sodnikov, za katere se vsaj pričakuje, da bodo nepristranski. Mnoge države še vedno uporabljajo volitve za imenovanje sodnikov, zaradi česar so ranljivi za vpliv politične porabe. Nekdanja sodnica vrhovnega sodišča Sandra Day O'Connor je bila v nedavnem govoru na konferenci na pravni šoli zaskrbljena zaradi vpliva financiranja korporativnih kampanj na sodne volitve, ko je dejala, da "sodne kampanje naredijo odločitev prejšnjega tedna v Citizens United vedno večji problem za vzdrževanje neodvisnega sodstva."<br/><br/>Dva temelja naše demokracije – svobodne volitve in neodvisno sodstvo – ogrožata aktivistična in vmešavajuča se odločitev vrhovnega sodišča. Primer bi lahko rešili veliko ožje v korist Citizens United, vendar se je namesto tega večina sodnikov odločila razširiti primer, da bi se zavzela za pravice velikega denarja nad interesi ameriškega ljudstva. Senatorja Dick Durbin (D-IL) in Arlen Specter (D-PA) sta marca lansko leto predstavila zakon o poštenih volitvah. Prepovedala bi prispevke političnih akcijskih odborov in ustrezala posameznim donacijam, omejenim na 100 dolarjev, na osnovi 4: 1, tako da se zbiranje sredstev osredotoča na ljudi. Takšen sistem je bil vzpostavljen v New Yorku od leta 1988 Zakon o financiranju kampanje. Preostali del države je že dolgo treba slediti. Nikoli prej ni bil boj za javno financiranje bolj potreben.<br/><br/>Avtorica je študentka političnih znanosti na Columbia College.<br/><br/>14. amandma, ki je bil eden od amandmajev za obnovo, dodanih po vojni severne agresije, države nikoli niso pravno ratificirale in je povzročil več težav kot vse druge povojne amandmaje skupaj. Če se prav spomnim, je vrhovno sodišče v poznih 1800-ih ali zgodnjih 1900-ih korporacije razglasilo za državljane 14. amandmaja. V primeru, da niste seznanjeni z besedilom te spremembe, je v bistvu vsakdo državljan (in predmet) Združenih držav Amerike. Pred vojno so bili vsi posamezniki državljani države, v kateri prebivajo, in nihče ni bil državljan Združenih držav, niti niso bili pod jurisdikcijo Združenih držav, razen tistih, ki so prebivali v okrožju Columbia ali na enem od ozemelj pod jurisdikcijo Združenih držav. Glavni namen vojne severne agresije je bil uničiti suverenost posameznih držav in zmanjšati status vsakega Američana na subjekt pod nadzorom in jurisdikcijo vlade Združenih držav. Ustanovni očetje so ustanovili našo vlado kot ohlapno konfederacijo suverenih držav z državami, ki izvajajo vso smiselno politično moč. Nikoli si niso predstavljali ali nameravali nobene učinkovite politične moči, da bi prebivali v Washingtonu. Stvari se bodo samo še poslabšale, dokler Mi, ljudje, ne vržemo menjalnikov denarja iz Washingtona in ne vrnemo naše vlade nazaj k temu, kar je bila nekoč.<br/><br/>Beseda oseba pomeni korporacija v zakonu. Ne gre za to, da korporacije niso ljudje, gre za to, da ljudje niso korporacije. Bili smo prevarani, da sprejmemo korporativno identiteto. Poglej svoje vozniško dovoljenje. Vsakič, ko gremo na sodišče, gremo kot korporacija, ne kot fizična oseba. Prve korporacije so bile vlade. Gledano logično, omejena odgovornost za korporacijo je podaljšanje suverene imunitete kralju, potem ko ni bil več kralj. Ista vladajoča elitna družina je še vedno pod nadzorom in to sega vse do prvih znanih nezemljanov, o katerih govorijo sumerski dokumenti. Ista skupina prevzame tudi zasluge ali krivdo za vse religije in skrivne družbe.<br/><br/>Kakšna je razlika? Razmislite o tem, celoten kongres in senat sta pes in poni show, pravi moč posredniki, ki nadzorujejo vse, so v senci, delajo poslov, delajo, kar hočejo, z AL-CIA-DA in MOSSAD tam ubija vse, ki se ne strinjajo s temi senci vladnih kretenov, ki resnično vodijo vse.<br/><br/>Zakaj je zdaj tako pomembno, da si vznemirjen zaradi tega sranja? Po več kot dvesto letih absolutnega dokazovanja, da so politiki le lutka, ki nas odvrača od PRAVEGA JOHANJA IN POSLUŠANJA V ZADNJIH SOBAH drugje, zakaj je zdaj pomembno, da SCOTUS v tej sodbi kaže popolno prezir do demokracije? Kreteni na tem sodišču vedo, da pravi fantje z rokami na vzvodih sistema niso v kongresu in senatu.<br/><br/>Ko je vladanje zakona postalo OBSOLETE v svetu na splošno in je vse postalo bolj ali manj ROLLERBALL samo tokrat, na STEROIDS, za in s strani CORPORATIONS, zakaj je ta edina sodba naredila toliko razlike? Zakaj vsi vi kreteni mislite, da ta "zaostajajoči" kazalnik konca vsakršne navidezne demokratične vlade naredi kakršno koli razliko.<br/><br/>Hipotetično, recimo, da se ta sodba ni zgodila. Ali kdorkoli od vas misli, da korporacije in finančni vplivi v senci ne bi še naprej izvajali nobene in vse svoje volje na nas ostale?<br/><br/>Za tiste, ki mislite, da bi bilo drugače, predlagam, da poiščete zdravilo za vaš TOTAL NAIVETE !!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>Ta odločitev ni naredila nobene razlike. Vedno je bilo tako, dolgo preden je SCOTUS v bistvu rekel korporacijam: "Pojdite naprej, delajte, kar hočete ... majhni ljudje so samo topovska krma za vaše vojne, chattel za vas, da trgujete in prodajate v prostem času. "<br/><br/>Demokracija je bila vedno iluzija, nikoli nismo imeli nadzora. Izdelava takšne gore iz tega krtovega hriba je popolnoma neupravičena, glede na dejstvo, da v celotni 230-letni zgodovini te republike debele mačke in bogati oligarhi nikoli niso potrebovali kongresa ali senata, da bi delali, kar jim je všeč, pod nobenimi pogoji, kdajkoli. Pravkar so to storili.<br/><br/>Vlada, ki ste jo gledali, je bila himera, ne resnična.<br/><br/>Prej ko boste vsi prišli do tega spoznanja, prej bomo lahko nadaljevali z manj lulanjem in stokanjem nad samo šalo o tehničnosti, ki je bila vedno taka od prvega dne, in nam je ni vtisnil SCOTUS, sodišče nam je le precej prepozno razglasilo, kaj se dogaja že dolgo, dolgo, pokvarjeno obdobje.<br/><br/>Noro sem zaljubljena v Exxon in Exxon ima enega na meni, poročni zvonovi spomladi - malo hitro vem, vendar najine ljubezni ni mogoče zanikati. Exxon je malo sramežljiv, zato ne pričakujte nobenih javnih napovedi, razmišljamo o mirni poroki v Renu.<br/><br/>Vsako podjetje je preprosto skupina posameznikov (majhnih ali velikih), ki kolektivno uveljavljajo svoje individualne pravice. Zato ima vsako podjetje enake pravice kot ti posamezniki (razen, seveda, volilne pravice, ki je pridržana posameznikom samim). Svoboda razpolaganja s svojim bogastvom, kot se zdi primerno, prihaja skupaj s svobodo, da si ga zaslužijo. Če je skupina posameznikov zaslužila denar, bi se morala svobodno odločiti, kako bo ta denar odtujila. Resnična težava ni v tem, da podjetja lahko donirajo kampanjam, temveč v tem, da se vlada lahko vmešava v poslovanje – to je, da lahko vlada v zameno za ta denar podeli nekaj uslug. Ločitev trgovine in države potrebujemo na enak način in iz istih razlogov kot ločitev cerkve in države. Zanimivo se mi zdi tudi, da je avtor kot primer izbral dva zakona (coniranje in minimalna plača), ki tudi kršita individualne pravice. Prva krši lastninske pravice, druga pa pravice posameznikov do svobodnega sklepanja pogodb.<br/><br/>Po tvoji Jackoffian analizi se nihče ne bi smel vmešavati v nič, kar kdorkoli počne. Recimo, če bi bil v množici, s posebno soboto zvečer, in želim, da "svoboda govora" rit z njim veliko na enak način, CIA svoboda govora Bobby Kennedy v L.A. Neko noč, da je v redu, ker vmešavajo z mano je vmešavanje v mojo pravico do svobode govora vas.<br/><br/>To je kritična napaka pri vas libertarnih kretenih ... mislite, da za nobeno pravno državo ni nobene družbene vloge, da se vse, kar spada pod "konec opravičuje pomeni", nikoli ne bi smelo vmešavati v racionalnost, samo pustite, da vsi počnejo, kar hočejo, in vse se izide. To sranje z Ayn Rand ne deluje! Deluje do točke, ko nekdo drug plača ceno za tvojo "karkoli hočem narediti" svobodo, potem pa se vmešava v mojo svobodo.<br/><br/>Pravila in zakoni bi morali obstajati v okviru družbe strogo obdržati pod nadzorom, da dobri stari "lahko naredim vse, kar hočem, in to je samo jaz, da sem svoboden" linija konjskih drekov.<br/><br/>Korporacije nimajo nobenih pravic, butec! Na svetovni ravni so bili razlog, zakaj je toliko propadlih držav, oropanih po volji korporatokratov s sedežem v ZDA, ki mislijo, da se svoboda njihovega govora prevaja v: "naredite, kar vam rečemo, ali pa vas bomo bombardirali, da bi dobili vaše vire, ki jih potrebujemo" neke vrste posilstvo in plenjenje.<br/><br/>Upam, da te bo nekega dne kakšen kreten zajebal s svobodo govora in potem bomo slišali tvojo žalostno rit, kako te je zakon razočaral. –Kakšen zakon? V vašem libertarnem svetu »lahko delam, kar hočem« je edina pravna država tista, ki jo izmislite, da upravičite svoj končni cilj. Za vas bo potem zabavno videti, kako se spopadate z razlago nekega drugega kretena, da je vaša meja le majhna neprijetnost za njegove cilje, ki sploh ni nujno spoštovala vaših meja, za prekleto gotovo!<br/><br/>Nekdo z imenom "uh huh, pravica .." bi lahko imel logično točko, skrito v gozdu klicanja in zlorabe slame, ampak kaj pa to: Korporacije so izumi države, ki so ustvarjene, da prenesejo nekatera tveganja poslovanja od ljudi, ki vodijo posel, na delničarje (če obstajajo), stranke (če obstajajo) in javnost. Torej, če korporacija stori goljufijo, je korporacija tista, ki je kaznovana (običajno) in kaznovana, in ljudje, ki vodijo korporacijo, odidejo z zlatim rokovanjem. In stroški globe se prenesejo na stranke in plačajo vladi (ne žrtvam!). Na "Davidovo" točko, če bi ločili vlado in trgovino, bi korporacije prenehale obstajati! Ni slaba ideja.<br/><br/>Mislim, da je bistvo v tem, da če korporacija stori finančni zločin, in nihče ne opazi (če drevo pade v gozdu in nihče ne sliši, je to res hrup argument), potem je zločin dejansko zgodilo?<br/><br/>In na sliki, kjer se dve kocki trčita in se prepletata, če ena posega na mejo druge, kdo je sodnik, ki je bil kršen?<br/><br/>Moja poanta je tole: ni slamnatih argumentov v zvezi z Davidovo asininsko oceno, da lahko korporacije delajo, kar hočejo z opustitvijo. Resnica je, da je dajanje licence korporacijam in oligarhom, ali komurkoli, da delajo, kar hočejo, kadar hočejo, pod predpostavko, da so posamezniki in zato zagotovljeno svobodo govora, absurdno in konjsko sranje.<br/><br/>korporacije so sestavljene iz skupin ljudi. ljudje, ki bi morali živeti po nekem videzu pravne države. Ko jim ni treba, potem je to "Lahko storim vse, kar hočem, dokler me nihče ne ujame ali me drži odgovornega za moje prestopke", ki se dogaja tukaj.<br/><br/>Če si David želi živeti v takem svetu, naj gre tja in se to zgodi, toda ne pričakuj, da ne bom ugovarjal temu sranju!<br/><br/>Vsi se lahko razumemo, dokler meje ne krši kdorkoli, ki meni, da je njegova pravica, da dela, kar hoče, pravzaprav izniči mojo pravico, da se ne vmešava s svojimi dejanji.<br/><br/>Kar zadeva korporacije, nimajo pravice kršiti mojih pravic, vaših ali kogarkoli drugega. Če ne morejo delovati v skupnosti kot dobrohotna in s tem ne vmešavajoča se entiteta, potem nimajo pravice do obstoja.<br/><br/>Davidu niso grozili, on je kreten, ker je trdil, da je "naredi, kar hočeš, to je svoboda govora" kup konjskega dreka. To je la la la land sranje. In ugovarjam, da kdorkoli ali karkoli krši moje meje s to trditvijo o svobodi govora. To je sranje in ti veš, da je!<br/><br/>No, to je bil barvit odgovor. Na žalost, "uh-uh", ste daleč od oznake. Nikoli nisem rekel, da imajo ljudje pravico kršiti pravice drugih ... in zavračam "konec upravičuje sredstva" razmišljanje. Da, zakoni bi morali obstajati, vendar samo za zaščito pravic ljudi. Žal mi je, da imate tako popačen in grozno napačen pogled na moj argument.<br/><br/>Opravičujem se, ker sem lulal v tvoje koruzne kosmiče. Mislim, da sem mislil, da ste sklepali, da so korporacije sposobne delati, kar hočejo v skladu s to pravico do svobode govora, kar je v Amerku danes šala, ker je Patriotski akt in neprijavljeno stanje VOJNEGA ZAKONA, v katerem živimo od septembra 2001, dal vladi možnost, da suspendira in "prekriža" ameriško ustavo in zakon o pravicah.<br/><br/>Na žalost imajo ljudje le nekaj pravic. Imamo pravico, da nas obdavčijo do točke absurda. Imamo pravico, da nas vpokličejo in postanemo topovska krma za oligarhične vojne. in imamo pravico, da utihnemo in utihnemo, medtem ko nas veselijo korporacije, oligarhi in bankirji. to so naše pravice in na žalost, resnično SUCKETH, David. Mislim, da se lahko strinjamo o tem!<br/><br/>Še vedno se sprašujem, kako je novinec, Roberts, podedoval glavno sodstvo po Rhenquistu, namesto da bi to vlogo prevzel nekdo z več izkušnjami na klopi. Dajte jim pravico, da volijo na volitvah kot pravi ljudje?; morda imajo glasove ljudi, ki se štejejo kot 3/5 osebe ali manj kot njihov 1?<br/><br/>Nisem še prebral vseh 183 strani dolgih knjig "vlada", vendar se mi zdijo te grozljive izjave v njih ne le v nasprotju z njihovimi ekspanzivnimi dejanji v tem primeru, ampak tudi nekaj o odpovedi njihovi dolžnosti:<br/><br/>Blodgett proti Holden, 275 U. S. 142, 147–148 (1927) (Holmes, J., concurring). Ker so vloge tako visoke, je naša standardna praksa, da se vzdržimo obravnave ustavnih vprašanj, razen kadar je to potrebno za odločanje o posameznih zahtevkih pred nami. Glej Ashwander proti DDV, 297 U.S. 288, 346–348 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concur-ring). Ta politika je podlaga za našo pripravljenost za razlago dvoumnih zakonov, da bi se izognili ustavnim problemom, in za našo prakso, da "nikoli ne oblikujemo ustavnega prava širše, kot to zahtevajo natančna dejstva, za katera se uporablja".

Izrecno je izjavil, da ne bo šel po tej poti pisanja odločitev, ki ne temeljijo na uveljavljenih, nekontroverznih konceptih ameriške ustave ... in tukaj je očitno storil ravno nasprotno.<br/><br/>Resnična krivda bi morala biti na ramenih pizdunov v senatu, ki so najprej potrdili kurbinega sina, da ne bi glasovali proti njegovi potrditvi, ker so varčevali s strelivom za PRAVE GROŽNJE NAM..<br/><br/>Bolj krivim preklete dinokrate, kot pa to gomilo drekačev, kot sta Schumer in tisti drugi kreten iz Illinoisa in tisti lažnivi sionistični pankrt Levin iz Michigana. Samo nekaj jih je lahko ustavilo Alitovo potrditev, potem pa Robertsovo.<br/><br/>Trditev, da je vse to le prevleka za okno, je pravilna in resnica je, da so ti izmečki v SCOTUS-u le post-fakt, ki trdijo, da so nas dolgo, dolgo, dolgo časa zajebavali.<br/><br/>Resnica je, da nikoli ni bilo pomembno, kaj smo mislili, da se dogaja, ker korporacije že dolgo delujejo izven zakona in nihče jih ni privedel do odgovornosti. Barabe, ki sedijo na SCOTUS-u, so dobrotniki prestopkov in pohlepa korporacij, ki jim zagotavljajo povračila za njihove odločitve, v obliki delnic.<br/><br/>Na žalost, osredotočanje na skorumpirane SCOTUS nam ne pomaga veliko. To je kot izrekanje očitnega, in pričakovanje, da bo kaznovano, ko ni.<br/><br/>Ne glede na to, kako gledamo na to, smo zajebani, vendar bo prišel dan sprave, ko bodo odvzeli vse sledove osebnega dostojanstva celotnemu srednjemu razredu v tej državi, bo pekel plačati.

Bolje deluje, IMO, da jih vrže iz njihovih načrtov igre.<br/><br/>To, kar se zdaj dogaja, je pospešitev v spoznanju pastirjev, da je nekaj resno narobe in da se fasada in iluzija obrabljata in padata, razkrivajoč grdo, večkratno ROTHSCHILD zver za korporatokracijo, ki si prizadeva za več moči in absolutno vladavino.<br/><br/>kot "srednji razred" ali kakorkoli ga želite imenovati, je vedno bolj desetkovan in uničen, na koncu se bo dovolj Sheeple prebudil do točke, ko bodo spoznali, da je bodisi vstati in se boriti ali umreti na vseh štirih.<br/><br/>sistem ROTHSCHILDS propada sam po sebi, zaradi preveč izven nadzora, nenadzorovane POŽARNOSTI, in zdaj, je kot visoka stavba, ki gre naprej in nazaj kot nihalo v potresu, na neki točki bo končno "zaskočil" in padel.

Oddelek 441b ni omejen na družbe ali združenja, ki so bila ustanovljena v tujini ali jih financirajo pretežno tuji delničarji. Oddelek 441b bi bil zato preveč razširjen, tudi če bi domnevali, da ima vlada prepričljiv interes za omejevanje tujega vpliva na naš politični proces.<br/>ZDA, na 615. >><br/><br/>ZDA so bankrotirale, ko je FDR poklical zlato. Nismo imeli več zlata za plačilo papirja, ki smo si ga izposodili od FED-a. Zdaj je v letnem stečaju. Vlada je zdaj zasebna kot BLACKWATER. Vse vladne agencije so navedene na DUNN AND BRADSTREET. Skupno pravo, ki ga ustava določa, se nanaša na fizične osebe. Vsa podjetja, ki jih sodišča danes je korporativni pomen, da smo obravnavani kot posamezne korporacije. Obstajamo po pogodbi z državo. Spomnite se 14. amandmaja. Pred tem ni bilo ameriških državljanov. Večina nas je nevede zahtevala ameriško korporativno državljanstvo. Pravilo bančne elite moramo obravnavati. Skoraj vsi vodilni REPS in DEMS so člani SVETA ZUNANJIH ODNOSOV ali TLC. Poglej zgodovino, kdo je začel in nadzoruje to. Rush, Glenn in Sean so vsi lažnivci in bankirji. Obama je lutka za CFR. 911 resnica ima veliko več nosilnosti in bi služila za združevanje poštenih ljudi v tej državi.<br/><br/>Resnično ne verjamem, da sem korporacija ali državljan enega, toda, če gubermint misli, da je, ali sodba SCOTUS pomeni, da ni več omejitev prispevkov kampanje za nikogar, podjetja ali posameznike? Raje bi videl, da bi denar odstranili iz našega volilnega procesa v celoti - enak čas na ameriških radijskih valovih, ki je brezplačen za vse kandidate. |
| And so the TWEWY Spriting Thread army set off, their destination being Japan. Unfortunately, no airline whatsoever would let them on board because of their rather large amassment of weapons of moderate destruction. And pitchtorches, which constituted both a fire and a stabbing hazard. And so, they just went home and downloaded the movie Kanon wanted to watch illegally. They gave it 7/10 stars on rotten tomatoes. The End.<br/><br/>Spoiler:The bottom right Sprite is the new one.<br/><br/>Highlight this box with your cursor to read the spoiler text. Yes, he's using a sword. I like to be boring and generic like that. Besides, no one else took the easy, predictable route, so somebody had to.

Besides, no one else took the easy, predictable route, so somebody had to. Peace out.<br/><br/>The first sprite was half made by me. The second row contains a teaser for the continuation of the clown sprites i made a while back. And the third row is just a few old sprites that i decided to fix up and redo some parts.<br/><br/>So I just joined, and tried to make a sprite, it turned out ok, but it seemed like a lot of work, and I only made a few changes to neku. How do you make the complicated ones?<br/><br/>Spoiler:<br/><br/>Highlight this box with your cursor to read the spoiler text.<br/><br/>Spoiler:<br/><br/>How to get better at spriting:<br/><br/>1. To start off, master the art of recoloring sprites and shading. 2. Next start copying and pasting body parts to other sprites. E.x Take the arm band off of neku and put it on joshua. 3. Start small by switching around body parts and re-coloring them. (in other words, just experiment and see which combo you like) 4. Then start to challenging yourself to make more complex sprites. Instead of copying and pasting and recoloring, you can try and draw clothes or faces. 5. PRACTICE PRACTICE AND MORE PRACTICE. Keep practicing and experimenting and never give upPeace out.<br/><br/>Sometimes people need to be reminded not to give up so easily and continue to persist. | In tako se je vojska TWEWY Spriting Thread odpravila, njihova destinacija je bila Japonska. Na žalost jih nobena letalska družba ne bi pustila na krovu zaradi njihovega precej velikega kopičenja orožja zmernega uničenja. In bakle, ki so predstavljale ogenj in nevarnost zabodenja. In tako so šli domov in prenesli film, ki ga je Kanon želel gledati nezakonito. Dali so mu 7/10 zvezd na gnilih paradižnikih. Konec.<br/><br/>Spojler: Spodnji desni Sprite je novi.<br/><br/>Označite to polje s kazalcem, da preberete besedilo spojlerja. Da, uporablja meč. Rad sem dolgočasen in splošen.

Poleg tega nihče drug ni šel po lahki, predvidljivi poti, zato je nekdo moral. Pomiri se.<br/><br/>Prvi sprite je bil napol moj. Druga vrstica vsebuje teaser za nadaljevanje klovnov sprites sem naredil nekaj časa nazaj. In tretja vrstica je le nekaj starih sprites, ki sem se odločil, da popraviti in ponoviti nekatere dele.<br/><br/>Tako sem se pridružil in poskušal narediti sprite, se je izkazalo, da je v redu, vendar se je zdelo, da je veliko dela, in sem naredil le nekaj sprememb v neku. Kako naredite zapletene?<br/><br/>Spojlerji:<br/><br/>Označite to polje s kazalcem, da preberete besedilo spojlerja.<br/><br/>Spojlerji:<br/><br/>Kako postati boljši pri pršenju:<br/><br/>1. Če želite začeti, obvladajte umetnost prebarvanja in senčenja. 2. Nato začnite kopirati in prilepiti dele telesa na druge sprite. E.x Vzemite trak za roko iz nekuja in ga položite na joshua. 3. Začnite z majhnim preklapljanjem okoli delov telesa in jih ponovno barvanje. (z drugimi besedami, samo eksperimentirajte in poglejte, katera kombinacija vam je všeč) 4. Nato se začnite izzivati, da naredite bolj zapletene sprite. Namesto kopiranja in lepljenja ter prebarvanja lahko poskusite risati oblačila ali obraze. 5. PRAKSA PRAKSE IN VEČ PRAKSE. Nadaljujte z vadbo in eksperimentiranjem in nikoli ne obupajte.<br/><br/>Včasih je treba ljudi opomniti, naj ne obupajo tako zlahka in nadaljujejo z vztrajanjem. |
| Interpretive Summary: This book chapter reviews various aspects of what is needed for the selection of model weeds to answer questions pertinent to weed science. Specifically, the chapter covers why we need model species, attributes of model species, and provides the current state of knowledge and resources that have been developed for a few key weeds such as leafy spurge, Canada thistle, waterhemp, and purple false brome that may make them good potential models.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract:<br/>Selection of a limited number of model weeds and development of genomic-based tools and resources will facilitate studies on the ecology, biology, physiology and development of weedy species. Such studies will help answer fundamental questions of concern to weed scientists. However, to ensure the weed science community can appropriately and fully utilize these model weeds, they will need to be carefully selected. Various attributes such as ease of study, weedy characteristics, and importance as a weedy species will need to be considered. Additionally, the availability of existing genomic resources can be used to extend the list of viable model weeds. Several resources have also been developed specifically for weeds such as leafy spurge, Canada thistle, waterhemp, and purple false brome. | Povzetek: To poglavje knjige obravnava različne vidike tega, kar je potrebno za izbiro modela plevela, da bi odgovorili na vprašanja, ki se nanašajo na znanost o plevelih. Natančneje, poglavje pokriva, zakaj potrebujemo modelne vrste, atribute modelnih vrst, in zagotavlja trenutno stanje znanja in virov, ki so bili razviti za nekaj ključnih plevelov, kot so listnati škrob, kanadski bodica, konoplja in vijolični lažni brom, ki jih lahko naredijo dobre potencialne modele.<br/><br/>Tehnični povzetek:<br/>Izbira omejenega števila modelov plevela ter razvoj orodij in virov na podlagi genoma bosta olajšala študije o ekologiji, biologiji, fiziologiji in razvoju plevelnih vrst. Takšne študije bodo pomagale odgovoriti na temeljna vprašanja, ki so zaskrbljujoča za znanstvenike o plevelu. Vendar pa bo za zagotovitev, da lahko znanstvena skupnost plevela ustrezno in v celoti izkoristi te modele plevela, jih bo treba skrbno izbrati. Upoštevati bo treba različne lastnosti, kot so enostavnost študija, značilnosti plevela in pomen kot plevelne vrste. Poleg tega se lahko razpoložljivost obstoječih genomskih virov uporabi za razširitev seznama izvedljivih modelov plevela. Številni viri so bili razviti tudi posebej za plevele, kot so listnati šparglji, kanadski bodič, konoplja in vijolični lažni brom. |
