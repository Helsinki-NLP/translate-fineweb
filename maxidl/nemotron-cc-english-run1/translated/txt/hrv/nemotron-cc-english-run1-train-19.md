| Quidditch through the ages<br/><br/>I was doodling some quidditch-related objects like broomsticks and snitches and whatnot and it sort of turned into this odd compilation of things, including Harry down there at the bottom. I am not completely satisfied with the way it came out, but since it's not bad for my second Harry Potter fan-art picture, I decided to color it anyway. If you are wondering where his scar is, it's there, but it's very very light and small because I did that bit on the computer. Sketched in pen, colored in Paint. | Quidditch kroz stoljeća<br/><br/>Pratio sam neke predmete vezane uz quidditch, kao što su metlice i cinkaroši i sve ostalo, i pretvorilo se u čudnu kompilaciju stvari, uključujući Harryja na dnu. Nisam u potpunosti zadovoljan načinom na koji je izašao, ali budući da nije loše za moju drugu sliku Harryja Pottera, odlučio sam je obojiti. Ako se pitate gdje mu je ožiljak, on je tamo, ali vrlo je lagan i malen jer sam to napravio na računalu. Nacrtano u olovci, obojeno u boji. |
| I just started saltwater fly fishing this summer and I need a new reel, so it'll definitely be the Kraken. (I'm in Florida; we don't have those little trout minnow things around here. ) Private Message on the way to you.<br/><br/>I'm thrilled and flattered. I'm also trying to figure out a way to explain to She-Who-Must-Be-Obeyed that I'll need to buy a new rod worthy of this reel.....<br/><br/>I've always found that no explanation is the best explanation. Don't give her a reason to ever say you're not spontaneous enough. | Počela sam loviti slanovodne muhe ovog ljeta i trebam novu rolu, tako da će to definitivno biti Kraken. (Ja sam na Floridi; ovdje nemamo one male pastrmke.) Privatna poruka na putu do vas.<br/><br/>Oduševljen sam i polaskan. Također pokušavam smisliti način da objasnim She-Who-Must-Be-Obeyed da ću morati kupiti novi štap dostojan ove role.....<br/><br/>Ne daj joj razlog da kaže da nisi dovoljno spontana. |
| If you were admitted and enrolled --> yes If you were admitted and attended another school --> yes If you took extension courses (do they even have them there? I know UCLA does) --> yes If you went to graduate school there --> yes<br/><br/>That's my interpretation because any of these scenarios would fulfill either being "admitted to an undergraduate program" or "taking courses" at UC Berkeley. I could be completely wrong though, you're better off just calling them and clarifying your specific situation.<br/><br/>My opinion: Based on the wording, I interpreted it as asking if you were admitted to Berkeley undergrad, whether or not you chose to attend. If it meant admitted and attended, they could easily have seen that through the "Undergrad Institutions" portion of the application. | Ako ste bili primljeni i upisani --> da Ako ste bili primljeni i pohađali drugu školu --> da Ako ste pohađali tečajeve proširenja (da li ih uopće imaju? Znam da UCLA radi) --> da Ako ste tamo pohađali diplomsku školu --> da<br/><br/>To je moja interpretacija jer bi bilo koji od ovih scenarija ispunio ili "primljen na dodiplomski program" ili "pohađanje tečajeva" na UC Berkeleyu. Možda sam potpuno u krivu, ali bolje je da ih nazoveš i razjasniš svoju specifičnu situaciju.<br/><br/>Moje mišljenje: Na temelju formulacije, protumačio sam to kao pitanje jeste li primljeni na preddiplomski studij u Berkeleyu, jeste li odlučili pohađati ili ne. Ako je to značilo primljen i pohađao, lako su to mogli vidjeti kroz "Undergrad Institutions" dio prijave. |
| ...........A lot of the time head bolts are angle tightened so you set them at say 20Nm for a starting point then angle tighten them from there.<br/><br/>.....I would have preferred a bigger hammer<br/><br/>Cheers.<br/><br/>You can never have too big a hammer<br/><br/>I'll confess.<br/>There must be a fine distinction between torque setting with a Click torque wrench and angle setting but even as an engineer, I don't really understand it.<br/><br/>To me, if you tighten a bolt you get to a point when it locks. And as TTT says at a relatively low torque. After that, further tightening both increases the torque load and the head angle ??<br/><br/>To me it's a distinction between measurement techniques rather then final result. If anyone can explain why one instead of the other I'd be greatful ??<br/><br/>I'm sure other old farts will remember old style torque wrenches with the separate pointer that swung around a graduated scale as you put load on them.<br/>Graduated in Ft Lbs, measurement in angle.<br/>Aren't these just a variation on the theme ?? | ...........Mnogo vremena glava vijci su kut zategnuti tako da ih postavite na recimo 20Nm za početnu točku, a zatim kut ih zategnuti od tamo.<br/><br/>Više bih volio veći čekić.<br/><br/>Živjeli.<br/><br/>Nikada ne možete imati preveliki čekić<br/><br/>Priznat ću.<br/>Mora postojati fina razlika između podešavanja zakretnog momenta s ključem za zakretni moment i podešavanja kuta, ali čak i kao inženjer, stvarno to ne razumijem.<br/><br/>Za mene, ako zategnete vijak, doći ćete do točke kada se zaključava.

| Winter Protection for Fig Trees<br/><br/>Report This Article<br/><br/>Winter Protection for Fig Trees<br/><br/>Overview<br/><br/>The fig tree has been around since at least 5,000 B.C., and is grown throughout the world for its delicious fruit. Figs grow well in a mild climate without weather extremes. The fig tree is now propagated in some areas with harsh winters. Protective precautions are required to save the tree from winter damage.<br/><br/>Potted Fig Trees<br/><br/>Ornamental fig trees in pots can stand some freezing and do not require light once they enter the winter dormancy phase. Avoid extreme swings in temperature by placing the fig tree in a controlled environment such as a garage, where temperatures range between slightly under freezing and slight above. The plant should be watered as the soil dries.<br/><br/>Shielding<br/><br/>Shielding to protect the tree from the most extreme winter weather is required. Fig trees require placement in soil areas where the soil does not freeze to protect it from disease and increase its chances of winter survival. Large screens placed around the tree protects it from winter winds that can damage and freeze the wood.<br/><br/>Wrapping<br/><br/>Tree wrapping protects the tree from cold weather and prevents hard winds from destroying the branches. Fig tree wrapping should be applied once the leaves from the tree have fallen to prevent leaves from rotting inside the wrapping material. Fig trees are sensitive to slight temperature changes. It can not warm up inside the protective film or else the tree may begin to grow, making it susceptible to severe damage during the cold snap.<br/><br/>Planting<br/><br/>Cultivar practices help to protect the fig tree during harsh winters. Varieties that are resistant to cold weather are best for locations where the weathers are harsh. Brown Turkey, Brunswick and Blue Celeste are good cultivars for cold weather. Planting should be done against a wall or structure that will radiate heat towards the tree during the winter months.<br/><br/>Snow<br/><br/>Roots of the fig tree require dry soil during the winter dormancy period. Watering should be done only when the soil is dry and the roots should be protected from melting snow and rain. Protection placed on the ground under the tree, near the trunk--to keep water from draining into the soil--protects the tree from damage.<br/><br/>Keywords:<br/>fig tree protection, fig tree winter, fig tree care | Zimska zaštita za smokve<br/><br/>Prijavite ovaj članak<br/><br/>Zimska zaštita za smokve<br/><br/>Prethodni članak<br/><br/>Smokva je oko od najmanje 5000 godina prije Krista, a uzgaja se diljem svijeta zbog ukusnog voća.

| Oculus CEO comes down hard on Mac support for the Rift<br/><br/>Oculus CEO, Palmer Luckey, has not minced his words when asked in an interview whether the Rift VR headset will ever support the Mac. If you had any hopes of it being soon, you might want to ready yourselves for some disappointment.<br/><br/>That is up to Apple. If they ever release a good computer, we will do it.<br/><br/>What he's referring to there in a less diplomatic sense is the discrete graphics required to run the Rift. The simple truth is that Apple just doesn't go for high-end graphics that will meet the requirements for the headset. For context, on a Windows PC, you need a minimum of an NVIDIA GTX 970, a $300 graphics card.<br/><br/>As Luckey went on to say:<br/><br/>It just boils down to the fact that Apple doesn't prioritize high-end GPUs. You can buy a $6,000 Mac Pro with the top of the line AMD FirePro D700, and it still doesn't match our recommended specs. So if they prioritize higher-end GPUs like they used to for a while back in the day, we'd love to support Mac. But right now, there's just not a single machine out there that supports it.<br/><br/>The Mac Pro can't be accused of not packing plenty of horsepower, because it does, but equally FirePro graphics are targeted more towards the creative market, just like the Mac Pro. The Mac Pro in particular far exceeds other hardware requirements, but naturally as the Rift is graphics heavy, this is where the shortfall is. Luckey is perhaps being a little over the top, but equally he's the man behind the Rift, so there's no doubts plenty of truth to what he says. Even if he doesn't say it particularly well.<br/><br/>What say you, Mac owners of the world? Are you even bothered about the Oculus Rift or is it something you wish you could have? Sound off in the comments below!<br/><br/>Reader comments<br/><br/>Oculus CEO comes down hard on Mac support for the Rift<br/><br/>No, not bothered by it since I really wasn't planning on buying an Oculus Rift. For me the product category is still too early and too much in a beta-kinda phase. But he does rise a valid point. Apple should try to get more ahead of the pack CPU/GPU wise. Right now they're always trailing behind.<br/><br/>Excuse me, but what is HTC Vive better at? And Oculus Rift most certainly supports Linux machines that meet their hardware specifications! (The issue is not OS but hardware.)<br/><br/>Also, look at WHY the HTC Vive supports OS X: it includes more of its own hardware. (Which is why it costs so much.) The Oculus solutions - both the Rift and the Samsung Gear VR - require the hardware that it is plugging into to perform more of the heavy lifting.<br/><br/>VR isn't a gimmick. 3D TVs don't always give that much of a 3d effect, and it doesn't work with everyone. VR works with everyone, and the Oculus and HTC Vive official release products have almost no latency so there shoudn't be any motion sickness. There's also plenty of game support<br/><br/>Obviously if gaming is a priority you're generally not in the market for a Mac, though. Not many game developers support OSX so these types of devices likely have limited use on a Mac (for gaming, anyways, which the Rift was designed for). At least that's the only reason I could see myself using one. I definitely wouldn't use it for watching movies.<br/><br/>Apple did implement the Metal engine into El Capitan, there might be some plan to go into the gaming market (as Apple learned from iOS how big this market is, just look at the top grossing apps).<br/>So now the hardware is missing and and game devs would probably show some interest, since Macs there are now an acceptable amount of Mac users around the world.<br/><br/>I would like to see Apple make its way into that sector of the industry. I don't use any Apple products presently but they're making a lot of the right moves in many areas and I'm very intrigued.<br/><br/>Plus, competition fuels innovation. I know that major computer part manufactures already create that competition but Apple has the RnD willpower and the cash to really turn heads. They may not win the numbers games in terms of specs, they actually rarely do, but most people who care to do the research know that performance != the sum of the device's parts. Apple can do more with "less". On paper their products appear inferior but when carefully balanced hardware meets specifically engineered software they generally perform just as well as the competition if not out perform.<br/><br/>HA! I love how, all of a sudden, having a high performance computer is not important to Apple phans! There is not a single Mac capable of the highest end graphics. Can't buy one, can't build one. Mac is not capable of being the highest in performance and you are good with that. HA! Classic!<br/><br/>I bought my MacBook Pro Retina in 2012 because of the high resolution screen and the non-discrete GPU. However, for my desktop I built a system with a 4K monitor, i7 4790K CPU, 3 GTX 970 GPU's, and 16 gb of memory all for less than what I'd pay for an iMac. I even have an SSD set up to boot in OSX. My point is Apple could do similar things if it wished, but doesn't. In fact, look at the most recent iMac. It includes discrete graphics and a slow 5400 RPM drive. My computer may not look as pretty, and it's not as thin, but in the end it's more useful - isn't that why we buy a computer in the first place?<br/><br/>I don't see why a Mac pro can not make use of the Oculus isn't it built for rendering video. I understand that it will not be able to run on iMac's and because of this the Oculus should be branded for Pro users due to the requirements and come at the price.<br/><br/>Now people are saying that your computer is doing ALL the heavy lifting, so why is the price point over $800 for something that isn't doing anything?<br/><br/>I'm excited about the direction of VR but not where it is at the moment.<br/><br/>Your display (which the Rift is) never does any of the heavy lifting. It's $800 because of what the display does; 110° viewing angle (still not human eye but much closer than other displays) with super low latency to reduce or eliminate motion sickness on a 1200x1800 per eye display for HD quality.<br/><br/>And yes, Mac's are very widely used for video rendering, but that rendering doesn't happen at 30+fps. It can take video rendering machines hours to render a single frame and sometimes years to render an entire movie. The final products, or pre-rendered material, is what then becomes 30+fps.<br/><br/>Thank you @TheRealFixxer<br/>Alot of what you say makes sense and some I was unaware of.<br/><br/>I guess I don't see VR as a game, but as an immersion and seeing Mac's are good at 3dcad and compiling video I would think they would be able to compile a scene well. I've even seen 3d renders of movie walk through. Creating a 3d world and placing cameras in areas to figure out how a scene would look<br/><br/>But I agree Mac's make more use of CPU cycles even by using there GPU's to help. WIth that said there are other directions one could take it. Like external thunderbolt video cards.<br/><br/>My big grip is the fact Octulas is looked at as a consumer product. If the requirements are that high, then it's more a pro product and needs to be advertized as that. I understand the technology is there but don't feel it's there to call it a consumer product.<br/><br/>Yes, you are right. Apple also has issues with software. Most aren't using "metal" the apple programming language which speeds up the processing for games because it's an Apple only solution where many use game engines that work on Microsoft Direct X or open source Opengl which most games use to run on Linux and oSX. Opengl is around 20% slower and sometime a lot more than that compared to direct x so a top of the line gaming card running in oSX runs as fast is a mid level gaming card in windows. So big problems not to mention most macs have built in cards that have no upgradability.<br/><br/>The mac pro is so different that Apple would have to do this as it wouldn't be worth a card vendor doing this as there is no profit in it for them with the small amount of possible buyers there would be for this. Apple doesn't like to loose money so I don't see this ever happening. Apple would loose money offering video card upgrades for mac pros.<br/><br/>Well he has a point though I do t care about oculus rift, rather wait for starVR. There should be an option to add better GPUs into an iMac and MacBook Pro. It is also sad that there is no more nVidia card, I liked the CUDA support now I will have to buy a PC and install Linux for my CUDA projects.<br/><br/>Gaming is a growing market and it won't be long until even iPhones have more GPU performance than the Macs. I agree that Apple should offer a high end GPU in a Mac<br/><br/>I am very bothered by the lack of high performance discrete graphics on Mac computers. Even the top of the like iMac uses an out of date mobile GPU which, of course, cannot be upgraded. If I want to develop software for VR, Apple has left me no choice but to buy or build a PC to run it on. As a big Apple fan (yes I admit it) this make me rather sad.<br/><br/>BTW, VR is not some passing fad. If you have tried it you know what I mean. VR is going to change gaming and content creation forever. My only worry about VR is that is too good. There could be millions of people that will become addicted to living and playing in virtual worlds. Look at how many people got addicted to MMOs that played on a flat screen. With VR you really feel like you are in the game.<br/><br/>Not worried about anything, i am pretty sure apple will have its own implementation for Mac and iOS when tech will be ready for consumers, right now it is more for hardcore users. Like always apple like to time its presence on right time, with right product. Have faith in apple.<br/><br/>It's funny that a lot of people know which vr is better based on os support. I guess you guys did heavy testing and now are the guy in the big electronic store that knows best.<br/><br/>HTC said it will bring support to the osx but that still needs to be seen.<br/><br/>I understand that a lot of you guys are stamped on there d**ks. But understand that Apple is more focused on laptops. And laptops can't be packed with more power than a PC, due to size, heat, power consumption etc.<br/><br/>He is right, even though he put it in **** terms. I love my Mac but Lord it needs a boost in graphics. Not that it needs to cost more but I would be more than willing to pay a little extra for a better graphics card or at least have the option to install my own. It's really too bad this guy had to make his statement sound like he is just plain uneducated. | Oculus CEO teško pada na Mac podršku za Rift<br/><br/>Oculus CEO, Palmer Luckey, nije izmiješao svoje riječi kada je u intervjuu pitao hoće li Rift VR slušalice ikada podržati Mac. Ako ste se nadali da će to uskoro biti, možda ćete se htjeti pripremiti za neko razočaranje.<br/><br/>To ovisi o Appleu. Ako ikada izdaju dobro računalo, mi ćemo to učiniti.<br/><br/>Ono što on misli tamo u manje diplomatskom smislu je diskretna grafika potrebna za pokretanje Rifta. Jednostavna istina je da Apple jednostavno ne ide za vrhunsku grafiku koja će zadovoljiti zahtjeve za slušalice. Za kontekst, na računalu sa sustavom Windows, potreban vam je najmanje NVIDIA GTX 970, grafička kartica od 300 dolara.<br/><br/>Kao što je Luckey rekao:<br/><br/>To se samo svodi na činjenicu da Apple ne daje prioritet high-end grafičkim procesorima. Možete kupiti $ 6,000 Mac Pro s vrhom linije AMD FirePro D700, a još uvijek ne odgovara našim preporučenim specifikacijama. Dakle, ako daju prednost vrhunskim grafičkim procesorima kao nekada, voljeli bismo podržati Mac. Ali sada, jednostavno ne postoji niti jedan stroj koji ga podržava.<br/><br/>Mac Pro se ne može optužiti da ne pakira puno konjskih snaga, jer to čini, ali jednako FirePro grafika usmjerena je više na kreativno tržište, baš kao i Mac Pro. Mac Pro posebno daleko premašuje druge hardverske zahtjeve, ali naravno kako je Rift teška grafika, tu je nedostatak. Luckey je možda malo iznad vrha, ali jednako je čovjek iza Rifta, tako da nema sumnje u puno istine u ono što govori, čak i ako to ne govori posebno dobro.<br/><br/>Što kažete, Mac vlasnici svijeta? Jeste li uopće zabrinuti zbog Oculus Rifta ili je to nešto što biste željeli imati? Zvuk u komentarima ispod!<br/><br/>Komentari čitatelja<br/><br/>Oculus CEO teško pada na Mac podršku za Rift<br/><br/>Ne, ne smeta mi jer stvarno nisam planirao kupiti Oculus Rift. Za mene je kategorija proizvoda još uvijek prerano i previše u fazi beta-kinda. Ali on se diže na važeću točku. Apple bi trebao pokušati dobiti više ispred paketa CPU / GPU mudar. Sada uvijek zaostaju.<br/><br/>Oprostite, ali što je HTC Vive bolje? I Oculus Rift svakako podržava Linux strojeve koji zadovoljavaju njihove specifikacije hardvera! (Problem nije OS, već hardver.)<br/><br/>Također, pogledajte zašto HTC Vive podržava OS X: uključuje više vlastitog hardvera. (Zato toliko košta.) Oculus rješenja - i Rift i Samsung Gear VR - zahtijevaju hardver u koji se priključuje kako bi izvršio više teškog dizanja.<br/><br/>VR nije trik. 3D televizori ne daju uvijek toliko 3D efekta, a to ne radi sa svima. VR radi sa svima, a Oculus i HTC Vive službeni proizvodi za izdanje nemaju gotovo nikakvu latenciju, tako da neće biti nikakve bolesti kretanja. Tu je i puno podrške za igru<br/><br/>Očito je da ako je igranje prioritet, općenito niste na tržištu za Mac. Mnogi programeri igara ne podržavaju OSX, tako da ove vrste uređaja vjerojatno imaju ograničenu upotrebu na Macu (za igre, u svakom slučaju, za koje je Rift dizajniran). Barem je to jedini razlog zašto sam se mogao vidjeti kako ga koristim.<br/><br/>Apple je implementirao metalni motor u El Capitan, možda postoji neki plan za ulazak na tržište igara (kao što je Apple saznao iz iOS-a koliko je ovo tržište veliko, samo pogledajte najbolje aplikacije za zaradu).<br/>Dakle, sada nedostaje hardver i razvijatelji igara vjerojatno bi pokazali neki interes, budući da Macovi sada imaju prihvatljivu količinu korisnika Macova diljem svijeta.<br/><br/>Želio bih vidjeti kako Apple ulazi u taj sektor industrije. Trenutno ne koristim Appleove proizvode, ali oni čine puno ispravnih poteza u mnogim područjima i jako sam zaintrigiran.<br/><br/>Osim toga, konkurencija potiče inovacije. Znam da glavni proizvođači računala već stvaraju tu konkurenciju, ali Apple ima RnD volju i novac da stvarno okrenu glave. Oni ne mogu osvojiti brojeve igara u smislu specifikacija, oni zapravo rijetko učiniti, ali većina ljudi koji brinu za to istraživanje znaju da performanse != zbroj dijelova uređaja. Apple može učiniti više s "manje". Na papiru njihovi proizvodi izgledaju inferiorni, ali kada se pažljivo uravnoteženi hardver susreće sa posebno projektiranim softverom, oni općenito rade jednako dobro kao i konkurencija, ako ne i izvana.<br/><br/>HA! Volim kako, odjednom, imati računalo visokih performansi nije važno za Apple phans! Ne postoji jedan Mac sposoban za najviši kraj grafike. Ne mogu kupiti jedan, ne mogu izgraditi jedan. Mac nije sposoban biti najviši u performansama i vi ste dobri s tim. HA! Klasik!<br/><br/>Kupio sam svoj MacBook Pro Retina u 2012. zbog zaslona visoke razlučivosti i nediskretnog GPU-a. Međutim, za svoju radnu površinu izgradio sam sustav s 4K monitorom, i7 4790K CPU-om, 3 GTX 970 GPU-a i 16 GB memorije za manje od onoga što bih platio za iMac. Čak imam SSD postavljen za pokretanje u OSX-u. Moja poanta je da Apple može učiniti slične stvari ako želi, ali ne. Zapravo, pogledajte najnoviji iMac. Uključuje diskretnu grafiku i spori pogon 5400 okretaja u minuti. Moje računalo možda ne izgleda tako lijepo i nije tako tanko, ali na kraju je korisnije - nije li to razlog zašto kupujemo računalo na prvom mjestu?<br/><br/>Ne vidim zašto Mac Pro ne može iskoristiti Oculus nije izgrađen za renderiranje videozapisa. Razumijem da neće moći pokrenuti na iMac-u i zbog toga bi Oculus trebao biti brendiran za Pro korisnike zbog zahtjeva i dolazi po cijeni.<br/><br/>Sada ljudi kažu da vaše računalo radi SVE teške podizanje, pa zašto je cijena iznad $ 800 za nešto što ne radi ništa?<br/><br/>Uzbuđen sam zbog smjera VR-a, ali ne i zbog toga gdje se trenutno nalazi.<br/><br/>Vaš prikaz (koji je rascjep) nikada ne podiže teške terete. To je 800 dolara zbog onoga što zaslon radi; kut gledanja od 110° (još nije ljudsko oko, ali mnogo bliže od drugih zaslona) s super niskom latencijom kako bi se smanjila ili eliminirala bolest kretanja na zaslonu od 1200x1800 po oku za HD kvalitetu.<br/><br/>I da, Macovi se vrlo široko koriste za renderiranje videozapisa, ali to se renderiranje ne događa pri 30 + fps. Strojevima za renderiranje videozapisa mogu biti potrebni sati za renderiranje jednog kadra, a ponekad i godina za renderiranje cijelog filma. Konačni proizvodi, ili pre-renderirani materijal, je ono što tada postaje 30 + fps.<br/><br/>Hvala @TheRealFixxer<br/>Puno toga što govoriš ima smisla, a nekih nisam ni znao.<br/><br/>Valjda ne vidim VR kao igru, ali kao uranjanje i gledajući Mac su dobri na 3dcad i sastavljanje videa mislim da bi mogli sastaviti scenu dobro. Čak sam vidio 3d rendere filma hoda kroz. Stvaranje 3D svijeta i postavljanje kamera u područja kako bi se shvatilo kako bi scena izgledala<br/><br/>Ali slažem se da Mac više koristi cikluse CPU-a, čak i koristeći tamo GPU-ove za pomoć. WIth koji je rekao da postoje i drugi smjerovi koji bi se mogli poduzeti. Poput vanjskih grafičkih kartica Thunderbolt.<br/><br/>Moj veliki grip je činjenica da se na Octulas gleda kao na potrošački proizvod. Ako su zahtjevi tako visoki, onda je to više profesionalan proizvod i treba ga oglašavati kao takav. Razumijem da je tehnologija tu, ali ne osjećam da je tu da je nazovem potrošačkim proizvodom.<br/><br/>Da, u pravu ste. Apple također ima problema sa softverom. Većina ne koristi "metal" programski jezik Apple koji ubrzava obradu igara jer je to Appleovo jedino rješenje gdje mnogi koriste igre motore koji rade na Microsoft Direct X ili open source Opengl koji većina igara koristi za pokretanje na Linuxu i oSX-u. Opengl je oko 20% sporiji, a ponekad i puno više u usporedbi s izravnim x-om, tako da vrh linije igraće kartice koja se pokreće u oSX-u radi brzo kao što je igraća kartica srednje razine u prozorima. Dakle, veliki problemi da ne spominjem većinu mac računala su ugrađeni u kartice koje nemaju nadogradnju.<br/><br/>Mac Pro je toliko drugačiji da bi Apple morao to učiniti jer ne bi bilo vrijedno prodavača kartica to učiniti jer nema profita za njih s malom količinom mogućih kupaca koji bi bili za to. Apple ne voli gubiti novac pa ne vidim da se to ikada događa. Apple bi izgubio novac nudeći nadogradnje grafičkih kartica za mac profesionalce.<br/><br/>Pa on ima točku, iako mi nije stalo do oculus rascjepa, a čekati za starVR. Tu bi trebala biti opcija za dodavanje boljih GPU-ova u iMac i MacBook Pro. Također je tužno da nema više nVidia kartice, svidjela mi se podrška CUDA sada ću morati kupiti računalo i instalirati Linux za moje CUDA projekte.<br/><br/>Igranje je rastuće tržište i neće biti dugo prije nego što čak i iPhoneovi imaju više GPU performansi od Macova. Slažem se da bi Apple trebao ponuditi high-end GPU u Macu<br/><br/>Jako me muči nedostatak visokih performansi diskretne grafike na Mac računalima. Čak i vrh poput iMac koristi zastarjeli mobilni GPU koji, naravno, ne može se nadograditi. Ako želim razviti softver za VR, Apple mi nije ostavio izbora nego kupiti ili izgraditi računalo za pokretanje. Kao veliki Appleov obožavatelj (da, priznajem) to me čini prilično tužnim.<br/><br/>BTW, VR nije neka prolazna moda. Ako ste ga probali, znate na što mislim. VR će zauvijek promijeniti igranje i stvaranje sadržaja. Moja jedina briga o VR-u je da je to previše dobro. Mogli bi postojati milijuni ljudi koji će postati ovisni o životu i igranju u virtualnim svjetovima. Pogledajte koliko je ljudi postalo ovisno o MMO-ima koji su igrali na ravnom zaslonu. S VR-om stvarno se osjećate kao da ste u igri.<br/><br/>Ne brine ništa, prilično sam siguran da će Apple imati vlastitu implementaciju za Mac i iOS kada će tehnologija biti spremna za potrošače, sada je više za hardcore korisnike. Kao i uvijek, jabuka voli da se pojavi u pravo vrijeme, s pravim proizvodom. Imajte vjere u jabuku.<br/><br/>Smiješno je da mnogi ljudi znaju koji je vr bolji na temelju OS podrške. Pretpostavljam da ste napravili teška testiranja i sada ste tip u velikoj elektroničkoj trgovini koji najbolje zna.<br/><br/>HTC je rekao da će donijeti podršku OSX-u, ali to još uvijek treba vidjeti.<br/><br/>Razumijem da su mnogi od vas d**ks. Ali shvatite da je Apple više usredotočen na prijenosna računala. I prijenosna računala ne mogu biti pakirani s više snage od računala, zbog veličine, topline, potrošnje energije itd.<br/><br/>On je u pravu, iako je to stavio u **** terminima. Volim svoj Mac, ali Gospodin treba poticaj u grafiku. Nije da to mora koštati više, ali ja bih bio više nego voljan platiti malo više za bolju grafičku karticu ili barem imaju mogućnost instalirati svoj vlastiti. To je stvarno loše ovaj tip morao napraviti svoju izjavu zvuči kao da je jednostavno neobrazovan. |
| The Masjid in the American Landscape: Civic Rights<br/><br/>Twelfth graders examine and explain legal rights designed to protect religious liberty. They evaluate the extent to which the First Amendment protects religious practices. They research and describe current and past legal battles over religious zoning and buildings. They discuss whether restrictions should be placed on where religious buildings are built.<br/><br/>What Members Say<br/><br/>As an online high school teacher, LP has helped me tremendously with extra resources! I have been able to use additional supplemental materials from here and students are able to gain more knowledge and a different perspective. | Masjid u američkom krajoliku: građanska prava<br/><br/>Dvanaesti razredi ispituju i objašnjavaju zakonska prava osmišljena za zaštitu vjerske slobode.

| What Guys Said 19<br/><br/>No, it is because entertainment producers and product marketers want actors/actresses and models who look like the majority of the audience, so that they are relatable and therefore more effective sales tools. I am sure that Asian women look wonderful to Asian men. To me, as a white man, they have zero appeal.<br/><br/>@cowboy101 I am 100 per cent straight. I do not go outside of my race. When I was a soldier I had the "me love you long time" experience in Asia. That has left me feeling uncomfortable whenever there are Asian females near me. Sometimes I become profoundly uncomfortable, even though the particular individuals have done nothing to merit it. During a visit to Thailand, I found that the only way to prevent myself being propositioned on the street was to take white a female with me as a minder.<br/><br/>Aha the thing is that there isn't many white people (or any at all) in China, but in 'white' places, (or at least Australia) there are quite a lot of Asians around there, which made me think about this question...<br/><br/>Maybe in parts of the country where you stick at (remember, birds of a feather...), just like to republicans it seems that most people are republican etc. While it can only be small minority that you are surrounded by.<br/><br/>And as far as I know, there are a lot of whites in china, mainly by business, etc. But it's simple, most of people there are Asian, so they prefere Asian girls (dogs like dogs , cats like cats, most people prefere their own kind). And there is nothing wrong with that. Same is in white countries.<br/><br/>I think Asians are the most beautful. Unfortunately for me the 2 I got involved with in my life one was using me for my place/internet a long time ago and the recent one was a gold digging stupid bitch. She never graduated college and was 30. I would be extremely happy if I met a smart cute Asian woman near my age that was not a gold digger.<br/><br/>@Prettyapathetic yes because when a man loves deeply he always good with you on bed no matter size of tits or colour of skin and a real man always respect a girl in every relation like mother, sister, wife, girlfriend etc<br/><br/>as a model from childhood I got my start with a company called sugar & spice. I was recruited in Japan while my family was stationed there.<br/><br/>you get a job because they are going for a certain look, who are they targeting, and the area you live in.<br/><br/>I had to leave the industry last year because of health reasons. I worked with with many types of people, korean, Japanese, chinese, polish, german, American, Spanish, arabic. I've worked with children, adults, teenagers all of these ethnicities.<br/><br/>I am half white half Native American (Lakota) so they loved my look from a young age. but there are many beauty standards in the industry and not all of them are as portrayed, some being made to look worse, and some not taken seriously enough...<br/><br/>Nope, it's because the Asian men are jealous and angry and invent thousands of excuses every rare time who have Asian women in the media because they are jealous of Asian women, and Americans want to keep the status of white women, this is why the couples between Asian women and white men are boycotted and all other race with white women are pushed, it's white women wiht white men and white women with other races in American media, since it's opression and offensive for the ego of men of other race the women of own race with white but white women with other race is "anti-racism". You need to understand the American political social engineering all over these years of media, democrats, politics and propaganda.<br/><br/>Anyway, in countries like china, japan, korea they have Asian men and Asian women only and the only exceptions are when they import a white women to make some fantasy scene for them but it's not so much, it's forbiden expose the hatred and jealousy of some Asian men.<br/><br/>The Asian boys will be happy if you say something against other men, but they will be angry if you say that the Asian girl will die for the blond girl date the handsome caucasian/white dude, they will try to force Asian women to make anything against these men to these small vocal group of Asian men feel better in their hatred, excuses, racism and jealousy. This is why Asian women is not showed so much, it's because the Asian men will be angry, it's because the white women can't be replaced, and the American propaganda is around white women with white men, white women with other race, white women against white men for the other race of men, white women in everything.<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>1&#124;0<br/><br/>0&#124;0<br/><br/>Opinion Owner<br/><br/>1mo<br/><br/>All the excuses of media and propaganda and all lies for racism, jealousy and hate aren't used against white women by the same men who invent the excuses, white women all the time in the media, understand, the American social engineering is made by democrats, democrats hate white men, and the most popular couples would be white men and Asian women but it's horrible for a few group of white racists who are racists even against Asians, is bad for the angry Asian men and their excuses, is bad for the white women, the democrats really don't like white men and work hard to try to make the couple and anything wiht white men and non-white women be related to bad things while pushing white women and non-white men. It's a American political problem.<br/><br/>I think it's a opression against the ego of the men of other race, so the white guys need to look bad, be some sort of jokes, be soft, while the scenes with white women and other race is the opposite of the scenes of white men and non-white women | Što su ljudi govorili 19<br/><br/>Ne, to je zato što proizvođači zabave i marketeri proizvoda žele glumce / glumice i modele koji izgledaju kao većina publike, tako da su relativni i stoga učinkovitiji alati prodaje. Siguran sam da azijske žene izgledaju divno za azijske muškarce. Za mene, kao bijelog čovjeka, oni imaju nultu privlačnost.<br/><br/>@cowboy101 Ja sam 100 posto ravno. Ne idem izvan moje utrke. Kada sam bio vojnik imao sam iskustvo "volim te dugo vremena" u Aziji. To me je ostavilo neugodno kad god su azijske žene blizu mene. Ponekad mi postane duboko neugodno, iako pojedinci nisu učinili ništa da to zasluže. Tijekom posjeta Tajlandu, otkrio sam da je jedini način da se spriječi da se predloži na ulici je da se bijela žena sa mnom kao skrbnik.<br/><br/>Aha, stvar je u tome što u Kini nema puno bijelaca (ili uopće nema bijelaca), ali u 'bijelim' mjestima, (ili barem u Australiji) ima dosta Azijata, što me natjeralo da razmislim o ovom pitanju...<br/><br/>Možda u dijelovima zemlje gdje se držite (zapamtite, ptice pernate...), baš kao i republikancima, čini se da je većina ljudi republikanci itd. Dok može biti samo mala manjina kojom ste okruženi.<br/><br/>I koliko ja znam, u Kini ima puno bijelaca, uglavnom poslovno itd. Ali to je jednostavno, većina ljudi tamo su Azijati, pa preferiraju azijske djevojke (psi poput pasa , mačke poput mačaka, većina ljudi preferira vlastitu vrstu). I nema ništa loše u tome. Isto je i u bijelim zemljama.<br/><br/>Mislim da su Azijati najljepši. Nažalost za mene 2 sam se upleo u mom životu jedan me koristio za moje mjesto / internet davno i nedavno je bio zlatni kopanje glupa kuja. Ona nikada nije diplomirala na fakultetu i bio 30. Bio bih iznimno sretan kad bih upoznao pametnu, slatku Azijatkinju mojih godina koja nije bila zlatni kopač.<br/><br/>@Prettyapathetic da, jer kada čovjek voli duboko on uvijek dobro s vama u krevetu bez obzira na veličinu sisa ili boju kože i pravi muškarac uvijek poštuje djevojku u svakoj vezi kao što su majka, sestra, supruga, djevojka itd<br/><br/>kao model iz djetinjstva sam započeo s tvrtkom pod nazivom šećer i začin. Bio sam regrutiran u Japanu dok je moja obitelj bila stacionirana tamo.<br/><br/>dobijete posao jer idu za određenim izgledom, na koga ciljaju, i područje u kojem živite.<br/><br/>Morao sam napustiti industriju prošle godine zbog zdravstvenih razloga. Radio sam s mnogim vrstama ljudi, korejskim, japanskim, kineskim, poljskim, njemačkim, američkim, španjolskim, arapskim. Radio sam s djecom, odraslima, tinejdžerima svih tih etničkih skupina.<br/><br/>Ja sam pola bijela pola Indijanac (Lakota) tako da su voljeli moj izgled od mladosti. ali postoje mnogi standardi ljepote u industriji i nisu svi oni kao što je prikazano, neki su napravljeni da izgledaju gore, a neki nisu uzeti dovoljno ozbiljno...<br/><br/>Ne, to je zato što su azijski muškarci ljubomorni i ljuti i izmišljaju tisuće izgovora svaki rijedak put koji imaju azijske žene u medijima jer su ljubomorni na azijske žene, a Amerikanci žele zadržati status bijelih žena, to je razlog zašto su parovi između azijskih žena i bijelih muškaraca bojkotirani, a sve ostale rase s bijelim ženama su gurne, ali bijele žene s drugim rasama. Morate razumjeti američki politički društveni inženjering tijekom svih ovih godina medija, demokrata, politike i propagande.<br/><br/>U svakom slučaju, u zemljama kao što su Kina, Japan, Koreja imaju samo azijske muškarce i azijske žene i jedine iznimke su kada uvoze bijele žene kako bi napravile neku fantasy scenu za njih, ali to nije toliko, zabranjeno je razotkriti mržnju i ljubomoru nekih azijskih muškaraca.<br/><br/>Azijski dječaci će biti sretni ako kažete nešto protiv drugih muškaraca, ali oni će biti ljuti ako kažete da će azijska djevojka umrijeti za plavušu koja izlazi s zgodnim bijelcem / bijelim tipom, oni će pokušati prisiliti azijske žene da učine bilo što protiv tih muškaraca da se ova mala vokalna skupina azijskih muškaraca osjeća bolje u svojoj mržnji, izgovorima, rasizmu i ljubom. Zato se azijske žene ne prikazuju toliko, to je zato što će azijski muškarci biti ljuti, to je zato što bijele žene ne mogu biti zamijenjene, a američka propaganda je oko bijelih žena s bijelim muškarcima, bijelih žena s drugom rasom, bijelih žena protiv bijelih muškaraca za drugu rasu muškaraca, bijelih žena u svemu.<br/><br/>1 .<br/><br/>1&#124;0<br/><br/>0&#124;0<br/><br/>Vlasnik mišljenja<br/><br/>1 mjesec<br/><br/>Sve izgovore medija i propagande i sve laži za rasizam, ljubomoru i mržnju ne koriste bijele žene protiv bijelih žena od strane istih muškaraca koji izmišljaju izgovore, bijele žene cijelo vrijeme u medijima, razumiju, američki društveni inženjering čine demokrati, demokrati mrze bijele muškarce, a najpopularniji parovi bi bili bijelci i azijske žene, ali to je užasno za nekoliko skupina bijelih rasista i bijelih muškaraca, azijski muškarci su ljuti čak i za azijske žene. To je američki politički problem.<br/><br/>Mislim da je to ugnjetavanje ega muškaraca druge rase, tako da bijeli momci moraju izgledati loše, biti neka vrsta šale, biti mekani, dok su scene s bijelim ženama i drugim rasama suprotne scenama bijelih muškaraca i ne-bijelih žena. |
