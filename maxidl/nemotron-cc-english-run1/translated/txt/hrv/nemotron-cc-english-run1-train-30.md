Undocumented migrants have nothing. They are not allowed to work. They have no right to state benefits nor to a place to live. They are unseen and potentially the most vulnerable group in the UK today.<br/><br/>Undocumented (or irregular) migrants include those trafficked into the sex trade or for domestic servitude; they include visa overstayers; those whose asylum applications have been refused and others who have been subject to failures in the immigration system. All of these may originally have come to the UK legally.<br/><br/>'Illegal immigrants' – those imagined to have entered the country in the backs of lorries – make up a small proportion of the undocumented.<br/><br/>Indeed some sources suggest that half the estimated 120,000 undocumented children in the UK were actually born here to undocumented parents. These children are disadvantaged from birth, solely by their immigration status.<br/><br/>The blog tells the stories of the undocumented. It highlights their daily struggles and vulnerabilities, but also their strength and resilience. It's not an easy read.<br/><br/>You can access the blog via our website (bottom of right hand column on Home Page).<br/><br/>The blog has won the online category of the Speaking Together media awards. The awards were a new addition this year to the Migrant and Refugee Woman of the Year Awards celebration at the Royal Festival Hall in London as part of International Women's Day. The panel of judges – including novelist and playwright Gillian Slovo, and journalist and author, Hannah Pool – was particularly looking for work that challenged myths and stereotypes.<br/><br/>The blog has also won the Blog North Awards 2013 in the Best Writing category and was also shortlisted for an Amnesty International Media Award. | Navigacija<br/><br/>"Život bez dokumenata" osvojio nagradu za najbolji scenarij<br/><br/>Blog projekt "Život bez dokumenata", koji je kreirao Len Grant, sadrži priče o nedokumentiranim migrantskim obiteljima i mladim ljudima. Migranti bez dokumenata nemaju ništa. Ne smiju raditi. Nemaju pravo na državne povlastice niti na mjesto za život. Oni su nevidljiva i potencijalno najranjivija skupina u Velikoj Britaniji danas.<br/><br/>Migranti bez dokumenata (ili nezakoniti) uključuju one koji su krijumčareni u seksualnu trgovinu ili za domaće ropstvo; oni uključuju vize za prekovremeni boravak; oni čiji su zahtjevi za azil odbijeni i drugi koji su bili izloženi neuspjesima u imigracijskom sustavu. Sve je to moglo biti legalno pristiglo u Veliku Britaniju.<br/><br/>"Ilegalni imigranti" - oni za koje se misli da su ušli u zemlju na leđima kamiona - čine mali udio nedokumentiranih.<br/><br/>Doista, neki izvori sugeriraju da je polovica od procijenjenih 120.000 djece bez dokumenata u Velikoj Britaniji zapravo rođena ovdje od roditelja bez dokumenata. Ta djeca su u nepovoljnom položaju od rođenja, isključivo zbog njihovog imigracijskog statusa.<br/><br/>Blog govori o pričama nedokumentiranih. Naglašava njihove dnevne borbe i ranjivosti, ali i njihovu snagu i otpornost. To nije lako čitati.<br/><br/>Blogu možete pristupiti putem naše web stranice (donji desni stupac na početnoj stranici).<br/><br/>Blog je osvojio online kategoriju medijskih nagrada Speaking Together. Nagrade su ove godine novi dodatak proslavi dodjele nagrada Migrant and Refugee Woman of the Year u Royal Festival Hallu u Londonu u sklopu Međunarodnog dana žena. Povjerenstvo žirija, uključujući spisateljicu i dramatičarku Gillian Slovo, te novinarku i autoricu Hannah Pool, posebno je tražilo rad koji bi doveo u pitanje mitove i stereotipe.<br/><br/>Blog je također osvojio Blog North Awards 2013 u kategoriji najboljeg pisanja, a također je bio u užem izboru za nagradu Amnesty International Media Award. |
| Sabbath School Lesson<br/><br/>In Galatians, Paul tackles issues such as freedom, the role of the law in salvation, our condition in Christ, and the nature of the Spirit-led life, as well as the age-old question, How can sinful humans be made right before a holy and just God?<br/><br/>Many scholars believe that Galatians may be the earliest of Paul's letters. It was written in A.D. 49, shortly after the famous Jerusalem Council (Acts 15). Therefore, the book may be the oldest Christian document known. As Acts and Galatians make clear, the early church found itself in a fierce battle over the nature of salvation, especially in the case of Gentiles. According to a group of Jewish believers, known as Judaizers, belief in Jesus alone was not good enough for Gentiles. Gentiles must also be circumcised and follow the laws of Moses (Acts 15:1).<br/><br/>This quarter's Bible study guide invites us to journey with the apostle Paul as he pleads with the Galatians to remain true to Jesus. It also gives us a chance to reflect on our own understanding of the truths that opened the way for Martin Luther's ultimate break with Rome and the restoration of the biblical gospel. | Sabat Škola Lekcija<br/><br/>U Galaćanima, Pavao se bavi pitanjima kao što su sloboda, uloga zakona u spasenju, naše stanje u Kristu i priroda života vođenog Duhom, kao i vječno pitanje: Kako grešni ljudi mogu biti učinjeni pravednima pred svetim i pravednim Bogom?<br/><br/>Mnogi znanstvenici vjeruju da Galaćanima može biti najstariji od Pavlovih pisama. To je napisano u 49. godine, ubrzo nakon poznatog Jeruzalemskog koncila (Djela 15). Stoga, knjiga može biti najstariji kršćanski dokument poznat. Kao što Djela apostolska i Galaćanima jasno pokazuju, rana se crkva našla u žestokoj borbi oko prirode spasenja, osobito u slučaju pogana. Prema skupini židovskih vjernika, poznatih kao judaisti, vjera u Isusa nije bila dovoljna za pogane. Pogani također moraju biti obrezani i slijediti Mojsijeve zakone (Djela 15:1).<br/><br/>Vodič za proučavanje Biblije ovog kvartala poziva nas da putujemo s apostolom Pavlom dok on moli Galaćane da ostanu vjerni Isusu. Također nam daje priliku da razmislimo o vlastitom razumijevanju istina koje su otvorile put Martinu Lutheru za krajnji prekid s Rimom i obnovu biblijskog evanđelja. |

Franz Frederick Karl Ludwig Georg Heinrich, Frederick Wilhelm Karl Joseph Ludwig Georg. Frederick se smatrao popularnim i inteligentnim, za vrijeme njegove vladavine, zajedno sa svojom lijepom suprugom, Charlotte, kulturni život u malom gradu dostigao je svoj zenit. Toliko je pjesnika i umjetnika provelo svoje vrijeme tamo da je Hildburghausen dobio nadimak Klein-Weimar, kada je posljednji vojvoda Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg umro bez problema 1825. godine, ostale grane kuće odlučile su se na preustroj Ernestinskih vojvodstava. Frederick je postao vojvoda od Saxe-Altenburga, kojem je dao prvi Temeljni zakon 1831. godine, u zamjenu za medije povezane s Frederickom, vojvodom od Saxe-Altenburga na Wikimedia Commonsu. net<br/><br/>Fridrik, vojvoda od Saksonije-Altenburga<br/>– –<br/>Frederick<br/><br/>Petnaest.<br/>Vojvotkinja Charlotte Georgine od Mecklenburga-Strelitza<br/>– –<br/>Charlotte Georgine rođena je u Hannoveru, kneževini Brunswick-Lüneburg. Bila je najstarije dijete i kći Karla II, velikog vojvode od Mecklenburga, Charlotte i njezine sestre, kraljica Louise od Pruske, kraljica Frederica od Hannovera i princeza Therese od Thurn und Taxisa, smatrane su najljepšim ženama svog vremena. Jean Paul Friedrich Richter posvetio je svoj roman Titan četvorici lijepih, Charlotte je odrasla u Hannoveru, gdje je njezin otac služio kao guverner, u ime svog šurjaka, kralja Georgea III od Ujedinjenog Kraljevstva, koji je živio u Londonu. Kada je Charlotte imala dvanaest godina, umrla joj je majka, a odgojila ju je njezina sestra, Charlotte, koja se udala za njenog oca 1784. godine, a njezine sestre donijela je njezina baka, Maria Louise Albertine od Leiningen-Falkenburg-Dagsburga u Darmstadtu. Dana 3. rujna 1785., u dobi od petnaest godina, Charlotte se udala za vojvodu Fredericka, vojvodu od Saxe-Altenburga, brak nije bio sretan, Charlotte je bila mentalno superiorna Fredericku, koji ju je počeo ignorirati. Također su imali problema, Saxe-Hildburghausen je bio financijski uništen katastrofalnom politikom Fredericksovih prethodnika. Primatelji su dozvolili vojvodi i vojvotkinji samo smanjenu civilnu listu, Charlottin otac i dva brata često su boravili s Charlotte u Hildburghausenu. Godine 1787. ona se trajno preselila u Hildburghausen i postala predsjednica kreditnog odbora. Godine 1792. Charlottina baka i njezine sestre pobjegle su pred napredujućom francuskom vojskom iz Darmstadta u Hildburghausen, a njezina baka je primijetila Charlottinog muža. Od svih svojih dužnosti on revno ispunjava svoje bračne dužnosti. Charlotte, koja nikada nije voljela ovog čovjeka, uvijek je trudna, obitelj je provela nekoliko bezbrižnih tjedana u Hildburghausenu. Godine 1793., Charlottina baka se vratila iz egzila i putovala sa Charlottinim sestrama u Frankfurt na Majni, Charlotte je imala vrlo intimnu i ljubavnu vezu sa svojom sestrom Friederike i rođacima u Strelitzu. Godine 1803. i 1805. pruski kraljevski par posjetio je Hildburghausen, za ovu prigodu, primatelji su dozvolili vojvodskom paru da obnovi dio svog namještaja. Louise je pomogla u izradi objave rata, Christian Truchseß von Wetzhausen zu Bettenburg bio je prijatelj vojvodskog para i kum Charlottinog sina Edwarda. Mnogi gledatelji došli su vidjeti bavarsku krunu princezu, a kada je primio svoje goste, Truchseß je pokušao prvo odvesti niže rangiranu Charlotte u svoj dvorac, ali je ona odbila, pozivajući se na svoju kćer. Truchseß je odgovorio: "Vaše visočanstvo će mi oprostiti, ali dok je ovaj dvorac stajao ovdje, Terezija je zatim zgrabila barune za drugu ruku, a njih troje su zajedno prošli kroz vrata. Vojvotkinja je dala oko polovice svog prihoda siromašnima, umirovljenicima<br/><br/>1617. godine.<br/>princ Charles od Hesse-Kassela<br/>– –<br/>Princ Charles od Hesse-Kassela bio je kadetski član dinastije Hesse-Kassel i danski general-feldmaršal. Odgojen s rođacima na danskom dvoru, proveo je većinu svog života u Danskoj, a majka mu je bila kći kralja Georgea II od Velike Britanije i Caroline od Ansbacha i sestra kraljice Louise od Danske. Njegov otac, budući landgrof, napustio je obitelj 1747. godine, a 1755. službeno je prekinuo brak s Marijom. Djed, Vilim VIII., landgrof od Hessena, dodijelio je grofoviju Hanau i njezine prihode Mariji, mladom princu Charlesu i njegovoj dvojici braće, Vilimu i Frederiku, koju je odgajala njihova majka i koju su od 1747. hranili protestantski rođaci. Godine 1756., Marija se preselila u Dansku, kako bi se brinula o maloljetnoj djeci svoje sestre, kraljice Louise od Danske. S njom je odvela svoje sinove koji su odgajani na dvoru u palači Christiansborg u Kopenhagenu. Hesenski prinčevi kasnije su ostali u Danskoj, postajući njezini važni gospodari, samo se najstariji brat William vratio u Hessen, 1785. godine, nakon uspona landgrofstva. Karlo je započeo karijeru u Danskoj. Godine 1758. imenovan je pukovnikom, u dobi od 20 godina general-major, također 1766. imenovan je general-guvernerom Norveške, položaj koji je obnašao do 1768. godine, ali koji je uglavnom ostao titularni, jer nikada nije otišao u Norvešku tijekom tog razdoblja. Godine 1763. njegov stariji brat William oženio se prvim rođakom, Charles je slijedio njegov primjer 30. kolovoza 1766. u palači Christiansborg - njegova supruga bila je Louise od Danske, a Charles je tako postao šurjak svog rođaka, kralja Christiana VII. Brak se održao unatoč savjetima protiv njega, zbog optužbi za razvrat od strane princa Charlesa. Ubrzo nakon toga, Charles je pao u nemilost na dvoru, a početkom 1767. godine on i oni su imali svoje prvo dijete, Marie Sophie, tamo 1767. godine, a zatim njihovo drugo dijete, William, 1769. godine. Godine 1768. Charles je kupio imanje i selo Offenbach-Rumpenheim od obitelji Edelsheim. Godine 1771. imao je dvorac proširen u dvorac i kneževsko sjedište, a njegova majka Marija živjela je u palači do svoje smrti 1772. Godine 1781., Charles je prodao palaču Rumpenheim svom mlađem bratu, Charles se nastanio u dvorcu Gottorp u Schleswigu sa svojom obitelji. Tamo su 1771. dobili svoje treće dijete Frederick, a 1770. kralj Christian VII. dao je svojoj sestri imanje Tegelhof u Gübyju između grada Schleswiga i Eckernfördea. Od 1772. do 1776. godine, Charles je imao ljetnu rezidenciju izgrađenu na mjestu koje je nazvao Louisenlund u čast svoje supruge, u rujnu 1772. godine, Charles je imenovan vrhovnim zapovjednikom norveške vojske, a on i Louise preselili su se u Christianu. Dodjela je bila posljedica državnog udara švedskog kralja Gustava III. 19. kolovoza 1772. godine, dok je u Norveškoj princeza Louise rodila njihovo četvrto dijete Juliane 1773. godine.<br/><br/>Osamnaest.<br/>Louise Caroline od Hesse-Kassela<br/>– –<br/>Louise Caroline rođena je u Gottorpu u vojvodstvu Schleswig u obitelji landgrofa Charlesa od Hesse-Kassela i njegove supruge princeze Louise od Danske.<br/>– –<br/>Princeza Louise Caroline<br/><br/>Devetnaest.<br/>princ Frederick od Hessena<br/>– –<br/>landgrof Frederick<br/><br/>Dvadeset.<br/>Princ William od HessenaPrinc William od Hessena<br/>– –<br/>Vilim od Hesse-Kassela<br/><br/>212223.<br/>Princeza Louise24.<br/>Sophia Frederica od Mecklenburga-Schwerina<br/>– –<br/>Sophia Frederica od Me252627 majke28.<br/>Albert Azzo II, markiz Milana<br/>– –<br/>Alberto Azzo II, markgrof Milana i Ligurije, grof Gavello i Padove, Rovigo, Lunigiana, Monselice i Montagnana, poznatiji kao Albertezzo II, bio je moćan plemić u Svetom Rimskom Carstvu. Smatra se osnivačem Casa dEste, budući da je bio glava prve obitelji koja je bila gospodar Estea, Alberto Azzo II bio je jedini sin Alberta Azzo I, markiza od Milana. Naslijedio je očeve urede oko 1020. i neprestano povećavao svoje imanje u sjevernoj Italiji, 1069.-1070. pokušao je steći Maine za svog sina Hugha, jer je njegova supruga Garsende bila sunasljednica prethodnih grofova Mainea. Hugh je proglašen grofom, ali nije mogao nadvladati Roberta, vojvodu Normandije, u investiturnoj raspravi između Henrika IV., Svetog rimskog cara, i pape Grgura VII., Azzo je pokušao posredovati, ali se kasnije pridružio papi. Oko 1073. godine napravio je dvorac u Esteu svoju rezidenciju, odakle je kuća Este, prije njegova građevinskog projekta, Este bila nešto više od sela. Njegov sin Welf preselio se najprije u Korušku, a zatim u Bavarsku, što je dovelo do jedne od najvažnijih obitelji u europskoj povijesti, a drugi sin, Fulk I od Milana, prvi je dokumentirano koristio titulu markiza dEste. Azzo II. oženio se Kunigundom, kćerkom Welfa II., grofa od Altdorfa i imali su jedno poznato dijete, Welfskog vojvodu od Bavarske od 1070. do 1077. i od 1096. do njegove smrti koji je bio prvi član Welfskog ogranka dinastije Este. Njegov drugi brak bio je s Garsende, kćeri Herberta I, grofa od Mainea, a imali su sljedeće poznate sinove, Fulco I, markiz od Milana, predak talijanskog ogranka kuće Este Hugh V, grof od Mainea, nije imao problema. Neki izvori kažu da je također oženio Vitaliju Orseolo, kćer Petra Orseola i da je imao izvanbračnu vezu s Matildom, sestrom Williama, biskupa Padove, s kojom je imao kćer po imenu Adelasia koja se udala za Guglielma Adelardija.

Bio je prvi član Welf ogranka kuće Este, u rodoslovlju Starije kuće Welf se računa kao Welf IV. Welf je bio sin Azza II od Estea i njegove supruge Kunigunde od Altdorfa, kada je Welfov stric po majci, Welf, vojvoda od Koruške, umro bez djece, Welf je naslijedio svoju imovinu. Welf se oženio Ethelinde od Northeima, kćeri Otona II., vojvode od Bavarske, kada je njegov tast, vojvoda Otto, postao neprijatelj kralja Henrika IV. i izgubio njegovo vojvodstvo, Welf je ostao vjeran kralju. U skladu s Henryjevim naredbama, odbacio je i razveo se od svoje vojvotkinje Ethelinde, a taj se događaj dogodio u Goslaru 1070. godine, kada su se bavarske države tiho podvrgnule novonastalom vojvodi, koji je bio predstavnik jedne od najstarijih obitelji u pokrajini. Njegovo odbacivanje vojvotkinje, koje bi se moglo smatrati činom nepravde. Papa i car su se površno pomirili 1076. godine, ali je godine ponovno sudjelovali u aktivnim neprijateljstvima. Henrik je, kao posljedica ponovljenih pobuna, proglasio Welfa svrgnutim u svom novostečenom vojvodstvu. Međutim, uz podršku svojih vjernih Bavaraca, a uz pomoć oca u Italiji, Welf je uspio održati svoje mjesto, međutim, Grgur je umro 1085. godine, a njegovi nasljednici su manje intenzivno sudjelovali u poslovima Njemačke. Welf, iako se još uvijek pridržavao crkvene stranke, nakon razvoda, 1070. godine, od svoje prve supruge, Welf se oženio Judith od Flandrije, kćeri Baldwina IV., grofa od Flandrije, i udovicom Tostiga Godwinsona, grofa od Northumbrije. Godine 1089. Welfov sin Welf oženio je Matildu od Toskane, čime je ojačao odnose s papom, međutim, nakon što se mlađi Welf razveo od Matilde 1095., Welf se iskupio kralju Henriku IV. i bio je ponovno potvrđen kao vojvoda Bavarske. Nakon smrti svog oca Azza 1097. godine, Welf je pokušao steći očevo vlasništvo južno od Alpa, 1099. godine, Welf se pridružio onome što će postati poznato kao križarski rat 1101. godine, zajedno s Vilimom IX. od Akvitanije, Hugom od Vermandoisa i Idom od Austrije. Njegov glavni uspjeh bio je spriječiti sukob između sunarodnjaka križara, koji su pljačkali bizantske teritorije na putu za Carigrad, sam Welf je pobjegao od fijaska, ali je umro na povratku u Pafos na Cipru 1101. godine i pokopan je u opatiji Weingarten.

Nastojao je naslijediti svog tasta kao saksonski vojvoda kada je Magnus umro bez nasljednika 1106. godine. Vojvoda Henrik ipak je održavao bliske odnose s vladajućom dinastijom Salijan, 1116. pridružio se caru Henriku V. drugom talijanskom pohodu kako bi zauzeo posjede pokojne markize Matilde od Toskane. Naslijedio je svog starijeg brata Welfa II. kao bavarski vojvoda, kada je potonji umro bez djece 1120. godine, Henrik je također bio instrument u donošenju Konkordata u Wormsu 1122. godine, okončavši dugotrajnu investiturnu kontroverzu između pape i cara. Brak je sklopljen u svibnju 1127. godine, otuđenje između dinastija Welf i Hohenstaufen trajalo je do 13. stoljeća. Nakon što je Lothair pobijedio na izborima, nametnuo je carsku zabranu Fridriku II.

| Follow Us<br/><br/>ARE YOU AN<br/><br/>INSIDER<br/><br/>Craving Sugar? Here's What Your Body Is Trying to Tell You<br/><br/>by<br/>Byrdie<br/><br/>PHOTO:<br/><br/>Jacquemus<br/><br/>Weight gain from out-of-control cravings aside, it can be frustrating to have a constant hankering for something unhealthy and not know why. The good news is that there's usually a reason underlying that burning desire to house a bag of potato chips, or the feeling that you might actually die if you don't get a pickle rightthisinstant (even though you're not pregnant). If you're having visions of Milky Way bars, for example, it could mean that you're missing a very specific nutrient in your diet. (Yup—it's more complicated than said chocolate bar being so darn delicious.)<br/><br/>We talked to Los Angeles–based dietitian Shira Lenchewski, M.S., R.D., to get the skinny on some common food cravings, as well as what you can do to satiate the hunger without going overboard. Keep scrolling for some seriously good information!<br/><br/>If you're craving chocolate<br/><br/>It means: You could be lacking magnesium in your diet, says Lenchewski. "Magnesium is an essential mineral involved in energy production, glucose metabolism, and muscle function. This is especially true for those hitting the gym hard," she explains. Additionally, magnesium levels lower during the pre-menstrual weeks of your period, which explains why PMS so often comes with chocolate cravings.<br/><br/>Instead, reach for high-quality, low-sugar dark chocolate, which is naturally high in magnesium. "I recommend sticking to 75 per cent cocoa or higher, and pairing it with another magnesium-rich source like sunflower seeds," says Lenchewski. She suggests the chocolate brand Hu, a small-batch food company that focuses on high-quality ingredients produced locally. "It's a little pricey, but all the more reason to keep portions in check," she says. "It's my personal favourite." We're also big fans of superfood-packed Zenbunni.<br/><br/>If you're craving candy<br/><br/>It means: "Craving pure sugar is a good indication that you're running low on energy," says Lenchewski. "Think about it. What is the one thing you're itching for after a terrible night's sleep or at around 4 p.m. during a stressful workday? The answer is usually sugar because it's used as instant fuel for our body's cells."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for apples with nut butter. "If you're raiding your co-workers' candy stash, I recommend a more slow-burn carbohydrate with a source of fat or protein," says Lenchewski. "Unlike simple sugar, this will fuel your cells while avoiding the post-sugar crash. Two options that make for great pick-me-ups the next time you're craving candy: a sliced apple with your choice of nut butter, or berries with 2% unsweetened Greek yoghurt." We like quashing a sweet tooth with these addictive coconut chips, too—they're filling, free of any added sugar, and just so good.<br/><br/>If you're craving salt<br/><br/>It means: "If nothing but the saltiest pickle will do, you may not be drinking enough H2O," says Lenchewski. "Salt helps the body hold on to water, so we crave it when we're in need of fluids."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for water. "Stay hydrated, especially as we approach the summer months," she says. The next time a craving hits, try quenching it (literally) with a few refreshing glasses and you might find the urgency to sodium binge disappears. "If plain water bores you, try adding in mint, lemon, or frozen fruit to mix it up," says Lenchewski. And if that still doesn't do the trick, there's a healthier alternative to bagged chips or fries. "If you're really just craving salt after all, toasted seaweed is a great low-calorie option," she says.<br/><br/>If you're craving starchy carbs like pasta<br/><br/>It means: "Because high-carb foods boost the feel-good hormone serotonin, starch cravings can be a sign you're in need of a mood booster," says Lenchewski.<br/><br/>Instead, reach for a bath! "Bust out the Epsom salts, because it's time for some serious R+R," says Lenchewski. "Trust me. Indulging in a starch free-for-all feels really good in the moment, but it will likely bum you out more the next day." (As anyone who has ever over-indulged a pizza or pasta craving knows.) So the next time you want to dive head first into a bowl of carbs, draw a bath, light a candle, and treat yourself without any regret or dense calories.<br/><br/>If you're craving ice cream<br/><br/>5 / 6<br/><br/>It means: "Your body may be telling you it's in need of some healthy fat."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for coconut ice cream. "I'm a realist, so if you're craving ice cream, I'm not going to recommend a handful of walnuts, which are, of course, full of healthy fat," says Lenchewski. "For ice cream emergencies, I recommend lower-in-sugar coconut ice-creams like Coconut Bliss or Kippy's three-ingredient ice cream in Los Angeles." We can vouch for the fact that coconut ice cream tastes incredible and just like the real thing.<br/><br/>If you're craving a burger<br/><br/>It means: You need iron. "If you can't stop thinking about red meat, there's a chance your body is craving iron, b12 and folic acid," says Lenchewski. "This is especially true during or around that time of the month."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for a healthier burger. "I'm a proponent of grass fed, antibiotic and hormone-free red meat once a week," says Lenchewski. "Try experimenting with an open-faced bison burger—which, cut for cut, is leaner and has more iron than beef." Don't eat meat? Try to incorporate some kind of plant-based iron supplement into your routine, like spirulina. | Pratite nas<br/><br/>JESI LI TI<br/><br/>INSIDER<br/><br/>Žudnja za šećerom? Evo što vam vaše tijelo pokušava reći<br/><br/>od strane<br/>Byrdie<br/><br/>FOTOGRAFIJA:<br/><br/>Jacquemus<br/><br/>Pored povećanja tjelesne težine zbog nekontrolirane žudnje, može biti frustrirajuće imati stalnu žudnju za nečim nezdravim i ne znati zašto. Dobra vijest je da obično postoji razlog za tu goruću želju za smještajem vrećice čipsa od krumpira, ili osjećaj da biste zapravo mogli umrijeti ako ne dobijete krastavac odmah u ovom trenutku (čak i ako niste trudni). Ako imate vizije Mliječnog puta, na primjer, to bi moglo značiti da vam nedostaje vrlo specifična hranjiva tvar u vašoj prehrani. (Da — to je kompliciranije nego što je rečeno da je čokoladica tako prokleto ukusna.)<br/><br/>Razgovarali smo s dijetologom iz Los Angelesa Shira Lenchewski, MS, R.D., kako bismo dobili mršav na nekim uobičajenim žudnjama za hranom, kao i što možete učiniti kako biste zasitili glad bez pretjerivanja. Nastavite pomicati za neke ozbiljno dobre informacije!<br/><br/>Ako žudite za čokoladom<br/><br/>To znači: Možda vam nedostaje magnezij u prehrani, kaže Lenchewski. "Magnezij je bitan mineral koji je uključen u proizvodnju energije, metabolizam glukoze i funkciju mišića. To posebno vrijedi za one koji teško udaraju u teretanu", objašnjava ona. Osim toga, razine magnezija se smanjuju tijekom predmenstrualnih tjedana menstruacije, što objašnjava zašto PMS tako često dolazi s čokoladnim žudnjama.<br/><br/>Umjesto toga, posegnite za visokokvalitetnom tamnom čokoladom s niskim udjelom šećera, koja je prirodno bogata magnezijem. "Preporučujem da se držite 75 posto kakaoa ili više i uparite ga s drugim izvorom bogatim magnezijem kao što su sjemenke suncokreta", kaže Lenchewski. Ona predlaže čokoladnu marku Hu, tvrtku za hranu male serije koja se usredotočuje na visokokvalitetne sastojke proizvedene lokalno. "To je malo skupo, ali još više razloga za držanje porcija pod kontrolom", kaže ona. "To je moj osobni favorit." Također smo veliki ljubitelji superhrane Zenbunni.<br/><br/>Ako žudiš za slatkišima<br/><br/>To znači: "Žudnja za čistim šećerom dobar je pokazatelj da vam ponestaje energije", kaže Lenchewski. "Razmislite o tome. Koja je jedina stvar za kojom žudite nakon strašnog noćnog sna ili oko 16 sati tijekom stresnog radnog dana? Odgovor je obično šećer jer se koristi kao instant gorivo za stanice našeg tijela.<br/><br/>Umjesto toga, posegnite za jabukama s maslacem od oraha. "Ako upadate u zalihu slatkiša svojih suradnika, preporučujem više ugljikohidrata s sporim sagorijevanjem s izvorom masti ili proteina", kaže Lenchewski. Za razliku od običnog šećera, to će napajati vaše stanice dok izbjegavate pad nakon šećera. Dvije opcije koje čine veliki pick-me-ups sljedeći put kada žudite za slatkišima: narezana jabuka s orahovim maslacem po vašem izboru ili bobice s 2% nezaslađenog grčkog jogurta. Volimo i lomljenje slatkog zuba s ovim zaraznim kokosovim čipsom - pune se, bez dodanog šećera i tako su dobre.<br/><br/>Ako žudite za solju<br/><br/>To znači: "Ako ništa osim najslanijeg krastavaca neće učiniti, možda ne pijete dovoljno H2O", kaže Lenchewski. "Sol pomaže tijelu da se drži vode, pa ga žudimo kada nam je potrebna tekućina."<br/><br/>Umjesto toga, posegnite za vodom. "Ostanite hidratizirani, pogotovo kako se približavamo ljetnim mjesecima", kaže ona. Sljedeći put kada žudnja pogodi, pokušajte ga ugasiti (doslovno) s nekoliko osvježavajućih čaša i možda ćete otkriti da hitnost natrijevog prejedanja nestaje. "Ako vam obična voda dosadi, pokušajte dodati mentu, limun ili smrznuto voće kako biste ga pomiješali", kaže Lenchewski. A ako to još uvijek ne radi trik, postoji zdravija alternativa vrećicama čipsa ili pomfrita. "Ako stvarno samo žudite za solju, pržene morske alge su odlična niskokalorična opcija", kaže ona.<br/><br/>Ako žudite za škrobnim ugljikohidratima poput tjestenine<br/><br/>To znači: "Budući da hrana s visokim udjelom ugljikohidrata povećava hormon serotonina, želja za škrobom može biti znak da trebate pojačivač raspoloženja", kaže Lenchewski.<br/><br/>Umjesto toga, posegnite za kupkom! "Izbacite Epsom soli, jer je vrijeme za neki ozbiljan R + R", kaže Lenchewski. "Vjerujte mi. Upuštanje u škrob besplatno za sve osjeća se stvarno dobro u ovom trenutku, ali vjerojatno će vas izbaciti više sljedeći dan." (Kao što zna svatko tko je ikada pretjerano uživao u pizzi ili tjestenini.) Dakle, sljedeći put kada želite zaroniti glavu prvo u zdjelu ugljikohidrata, nacrtajte kupku, zapalite svijeću i liječite se bez žaljenja ili gustih kalorija.<br/><br/>Ako žudiš za sladoledom<br/><br/>5 / 6<br/><br/>To znači: "Vaše tijelo vam možda govori da mu je potrebna neka zdrava mast."<br/><br/>Umjesto toga, posegnite za kokosovim sladoledom. "Ja sam realist, pa ako žudite za sladoledom, neću vam preporučiti šaku oraha, koji su, naravno, puni zdrave masti", kaže Lenchewski. "Za hitne slučajeve sa sladoledom, preporučujem sladoled od kokosa s niskim unosom šećera kao što je Coconut Bliss ili Kippyjev sladoled s tri sastojka u Los Angelesu." Možemo jamčiti za činjenicu da sladoled od kokosa ima nevjerojatan okus i baš kao prava stvar.<br/><br/>Ako žudiš za hamburgerom<br/><br/>To znači: Trebate željezo. "Ako ne možete prestati razmišljati o crvenom mesu, postoji šansa da vaše tijelo žudi za željezom, b12 i folnom kiselinom", kaže Lenchewski. "To je osobito istinito tijekom ili oko tog doba mjeseca."<br/><br/>Umjesto toga, posegnite za zdravijim hamburgerom. "Ja sam zagovornik hranjenja travom, antibiotikom i crvenim mesom bez hormona jednom tjedno", kaže Lenchewski. "Probajte eksperimentirati s bizonskim hamburgerom s otvorenim licem - koji je, izrezan za rezanje, mršaviji i ima više željeza nego govedina." Ne jedete meso? Pokušajte uključiti neku vrstu dodatka željeza na biljnoj osnovi u svoju rutinu, kao što je spirulina. |

Spoiler alert: This brain teaser is entirely solvable. Scroll down to read the puzzle, and to get the answer. Good luck!<br/><br/>Here's The Puzzle<br/><br/>Alice and Bob are each told a number, but neither knows the other's number. Both of the numbers are positive and consecutive. In the room with Alice and Bob, there is a clock that dings every minute. Someone can guess the other's number only at the ding of that clock, but they can also remain silent. If someone correctly guesses the other's number on the first try, both people $1 million.<br/><br/>There is a way to win without any form of communication between Alice and Bob, and, duh, without cheating. It's completely logical and can guarantee a win on the first try. How can they do it? Watch the video below to find out.<br/><br/>The Seemingly Impossible Guess The Number Puzzle<br/><br/>Share the knowledge!<br/><br/>Here's The Answer<br/><br/>Suppose Alice is told the number N. She hears the clock ding N-1 times, so she knows that Bob was told N+1. Therefore, on the next ding, she can correctly guess Bob's secret number. If we're dealing with small numbers, however, it can be played differently. If Alice was told 1, she knows Bob was told 2 because 0 is not a positive (or negative) number.

Srecno! -Srecno!<br/><br/>Evo i zagonetke<br/><br/>Alice i Bobu svaki kaže broj, ali ni jedan ne zna broj drugoga. Oba broja su pozitivna i uzastopna. U sobi s Alice i Bobom, tu je sat koji dings svake minute. Netko može pogoditi broj drugoga samo na dingu tog sata, ali također mogu šutjeti. Ako netko ispravno pogodi broj drugoga na prvom pokušaju, obje osobe iznose milijun dolara.<br/><br/>Postoji način za pobjedu bez ikakvog oblika komunikacije između Alice i Boba, i, duh, bez varanja. Potpuno je logično i može jamčiti pobjedu na prvom pokušaju. Kako to mogu učiniti? Pogledajte videozapis u nastavku kako biste saznali.<br/><br/>Naizgled nemoguća zagonetka broja<br/><br/>Podijelite znanje!<br/><br/>Evo odgovora<br/><br/>Pretpostavimo da Alice je rekao broj N. Ona čuje sat ding N-1 puta, tako da ona zna da je Bob rekao N + 1. Stoga, na sljedećoj ding, ona može točno pogoditi Bob tajni broj. Ako imamo posla s malim brojevima, međutim, može se igrati drugačije. Ako je Alice rečeno 1, zna da je Bob rekao 2 jer 0 nije pozitivan (ili negativan) broj.

| Web Services, Vendors And Cyber Laws!<br/><br/>Updated On:April 21, 2014Bilal Ahmad<br/><br/>Computerization of this world changed human performance scenario to a great extent and that too beyond measurement. For instance, Now you can send vital information all across the globe with a single mouse click, thanks to internet connectivity. Sadly, it is this wide connectivity and popularity among people, internet has also increased chances for computer crimes. Internet crimes or computer crimes are widely known as 'Cyber Crimes'.<br/><br/>'Cyber Laws' is something new in the judiciary system but has gained a lot of attention lately. The term cyber crime is something very synonymous with conventional crime, the only difference being medium of execution. There are majorly two types of cyber crimes, the first one is in which computers are the main targets and these include cases of data damage, malicious code and even criminal data access. The second one is in which computer is only a tool using which conventional crimes are committed for eg cyber terrorism, spamming, cyber stalking and many more.<br/><br/>This is where a website consultant or a vendor comes into scene. Although not aware of all the cyber laws present till date, a website vendor can advise you on some of the most vital cyber laws while creating your site.<br/><br/>This may include common knowledge of copy rights or even protecting the content of your own website. Explaining you all the rights you posses as a website owner is also one the tasks a website vendor may do while developing your website. A vendor can also assist you by offering you information on different cyber laws to protect data. Besides all of this, a vendor can also offer you information on any new cyber law that you may not be aware of till know. Cyber laws may vary from nation to nation, one recent example can be of the cookie law released in the United Kingdom, which prevents the website from saving any user browsing data. As per the Cookie Law, websites in the United Kingdom cannot save cookie files without informational consent from the surfer.<br/><br/>It is after the implementation of such law, websites now have a pop-up window, which seeks the consent of the visitor for saving cookies files. Such files are used by websites to analyze the browsing pattern of visitors based on which advertisements are then posted on a user window. With hacking not anymore a new thing for all of us, do you think such rules and regulations can prevent online forgery or cyber crime? Technology has developed at a rapid rate but still people do not prefer shopping online due to fear of personal or bank account details getting hacked. With the rise of cyber crime, need of stringent cyber laws have also increased to curb the same and to promote a risk free shopping experience.<br/><br/>Classes of Cyber Crimes<br/><br/>Over the years there have been three major classes of cyber crimes:<br/><br/>Unauthorized access of computer system cases, which involves hacking or stealing usernames and passwords to gain access over personal information of the respective user. These kind of backdoor access are organized with the help of Trojan Horse. Releasing malicious programs like Trojan House, worms or computer viruses etc. The last class includes cyber stalking a user or online harassment .<br/><br/>Direct implications of Cyber crimes<br/><br/>Decrease in sales<br/><br/>Decrease in staff output due to network delays<br/><br/>Loss of personalized information like research work<br/><br/>Disruption in communication process<br/><br/>Indirect implications of Cyber crimes<br/><br/>Credibility issue in our financial system<br/><br/>Brand image is tarnished in the market<br/><br/>Cyber crimes affect business to business relationship in the market<br/><br/>Sense of trust in state policies and government agencies is lost<br/><br/>Preventing Cyber Crime<br/><br/>As netizens there are certain precautions that we should consider for a safe and secure online experience. Here are some of them:<br/><br/>First thing to do will be to keep personal information to your self and avoid sharing the same online.<br/><br/>Avoid sharing any photographs with online chat friends or strangers.<br/><br/>Installing latest version of anti-virus on your system can offer you a good line of defense against internet threats like viruses and malware.<br/><br/>Keeping back up of your valuable data is a good option to avoid problems like virus contamination.<br/><br/>Avoid sending credit card information to sites that are unsecured and don't have any valid certificate.<br/><br/>Installing safety programme that offers you control over site cookies and saves you from being tracked by websites.<br/><br/>Putting host-based intrusions detection devices on servers will help you keep track of irregularities on your website traffic.<br/><br/>Use of firewall is advised.<br/><br/>Why Cyber attacks are so popular?<br/><br/>Cheaper than traditional cheating methods<br/><br/>Tracking cyber crimes are not easy<br/><br/>Exact locations cannot be tracked easily<br/><br/>Absence of physical barrier in the internet world<br/><br/>Cyber crimes affect large number of people<br/><br/>Conclusion<br/><br/>The fact that human mind has unfathomable power is undeniable, which is why internet crimes are increasing at a tremendous rate. Even history has witnessed some of the greatest internet security gone kaput by the hands of hackers, who have easily got away too. The only way to curb such crime is to remain aware of the cyber laws that we have today, that can either be through internet or through website/IT vendors. Information Technology Act has to be balanced in such a way that it proves too stringent for people who are involved in cyber crimes and at the same time it should never hamper the growth of Internet industry.<br/><br/>Author Bio:– Maneet Puri at present is heading a quality web design firm located at New Delhi, India. With unmatchable expertise in technical domain, he has been offering professional web consultation services to his clients located all round the globe. He is also an avid writer and some of his commended work have been published on renowned websites | Web usluge, dobavljači i cyber zakoni!<br/><br/>Ažurirano:Travanj 21, 2014Bilal Ahmad<br/><br/>Kompjuterizacija ovog svijeta promijenio scenarij ljudske izvedbe u velikoj mjeri i da previše izvan mjerenja. Na primjer, Sada možete poslati važne informacije diljem svijeta s jednim klikom miša, zahvaljujući internetskoj povezivosti. Nažalost, to je ta široka povezanost i popularnost među ljudima, Internet je također povećao šanse za računalne zločine. Internet zločini ili računalni zločini su naširoko poznati kao "Cyber Crimes".<br/><br/>'Cyber zakoni' su nešto novo u pravosudnom sustavu, ali su u posljednje vrijeme dobili puno pažnje. Pojam cyber kriminal je nešto vrlo sinonim za konvencionalni kriminal, a jedina razlika je medij izvršenja. Uglavnom postoje dvije vrste cyber kriminala, od kojih je prva u kojoj su računala glavne mete, a to su slučajevi oštećenja podataka, zlonamjernog koda, pa čak i kriminalnog pristupa podacima. Drugi je u kojem je računalo samo alat pomoću kojeg se počinju konvencionalni zločini npr. za cyber terorizam, spam, cyber uhođenje i još mnogo toga.<br/><br/>Ovo je mjesto gdje web savjetnik ili prodavač dolazi na scenu. Iako nisu svjesni svih cyber zakona prisutnih do danas, prodavač web stranica može vam savjetovati o nekim od najvažnijih cyber zakona prilikom izrade vaše web stranice.<br/><br/>To može uključivati opće poznavanje prava kopiranja ili čak zaštitu sadržaja vlastite web stranice. Objašnjenje svih prava koja imate kao vlasnik web stranice također je jedan od zadataka koje dobavljač web stranice može učiniti tijekom razvoja vaše web stranice. Prodavač vam također može pomoći nudeći vam informacije o različitim cyber zakonima za zaštitu podataka. Osim svega toga, prodavač vam također može ponuditi informacije o bilo kojem novom cyber zakonu za koji možda niste svjesni dok ne saznate. Cyber zakoni mogu se razlikovati od države do države, jedan nedavni primjer može biti zakon o kolačićima objavljen u Velikoj Britaniji, koji sprječava web stranicu da spremi bilo kakve podatke o pregledavanju korisnika. Prema Zakonu o kolačićima, internetske stranice u Velikoj Britaniji ne mogu pohraniti datoteke kolačića bez informativne suglasnosti surfera.<br/><br/>Upravo nakon primjene takvog zakona, web stranice sada imaju pop-up prozor, koji traži pristanak posjetitelja za spremanje datoteka kolačića. Takve datoteke koriste internetske stranice za analizu obrasca pregledavanja posjetitelja na temelju kojih se oglasi zatim objavljuju u korisničkom prozoru. Budući da hakiranje više nije nova stvar za sve nas, mislite li da takva pravila i propisi mogu spriječiti online krivotvorenje ili cyber kriminal? Tehnologija se razvila brzom brzinom, ali ljudi još uvijek ne vole kupovati online zbog straha od hakiranja osobnih podataka ili bankovnih računa. S porastom kibernetičkog kriminala, potreba za strogim kibernetičkim zakonima također je porasla kako bi se ograničili isti i kako bi se promicalo iskustvo kupovine bez rizika.<br/><br/>Klase kibernetičkih zločina<br/><br/>Tijekom godina postojale su tri glavne klase cyber kriminala:<br/><br/>Neovlašteni pristup računalnim sustavima, koji uključuje hakiranje ili krađu korisničkih imena i lozinki za pristup osobnim podacima odgovarajućeg korisnika. Ova vrsta backdoor pristupa organizirana je uz pomoć trojanskog konja. Oslobađanje zlonamjernih programa kao što su Trojanska kuća, crvi ili računalni virusi itd. Posljednja klasa uključuje cyber uhođenje korisnika ili online uznemiravanje .<br/><br/>Izravne implikacije kibernetičkog kriminala<br/><br/>Smanjenje prodaje<br/><br/>Smanjenje broja zaposlenika zbog kašnjenja u radu mreže<br/><br/>Gubitak personaliziranih informacija kao što je istraživački rad<br/><br/>Poremećaji u komunikacijskom procesu<br/><br/>Neizravne implikacije kibernetičkog kriminala<br/><br/>Problem vjerodostojnosti u našem financijskom sustavu<br/><br/>Imidž robne marke narušen je na tržištu<br/><br/>Kibernetički kriminal utječe na poslovanje na tržištu<br/><br/>Gubi se osjećaj povjerenja u državne politike i vladine agencije<br/><br/>Sprječavanje kibernetičkog kriminala<br/><br/>Kao netizens postoje određene mjere predostrožnosti koje bismo trebali razmotriti za sigurno i sigurno online iskustvo. Evo nekih od njih:<br/><br/>Prva stvar koju trebate učiniti je zadržati osobne podatke za sebe i izbjegavati dijeljenje istih na internetu.<br/><br/>Izbjegavajte dijeljenje fotografija s prijateljima ili strancima.<br/><br/>Instaliranje najnovije verzije antivirusa na vaš sustav može vam ponuditi dobru liniju obrane od internetskih prijetnji kao što su virusi i zlonamjerni softver.<br/><br/>Održavanje sigurnosnih kopija vaših vrijednih podataka dobra je opcija za izbjegavanje problema kao što je kontaminacija virusima.<br/><br/>Izbjegavajte slanje podataka o kreditnoj kartici na stranice koje nisu osigurane i nemaju valjanu potvrdu.<br/><br/>Instaliranje sigurnosnog programa koji vam nudi kontrolu nad kolačićima web-lokacije i štedi vas od praćenja web-lokacija.<br/><br/>Postavljanje uređaja za otkrivanje upada na poslužitelje pomoći će vam da pratite nepravilnosti u prometu na web-lokaciji.<br/><br/>Preporučuje se korištenje firewalla.<br/><br/>Zašto su cyber napadi tako popularni?<br/><br/>Jeftinije od tradicionalnih metoda varanja<br/><br/>Praćenje kibernetičkog kriminala nije lako<br/><br/>Točne lokacije se ne mogu lako pratiti<br/><br/>Nepostojanje fizičkih barijera u svijetu interneta<br/><br/>Kibernetički kriminal utječe na velik broj ljudi<br/><br/>Zaključak<br/><br/>Činjenica da ljudski um ima neopisivu moć je neporeciva, zbog čega internetski kriminal raste ogromnom brzinom. Čak je i povijest svjedočila da su neke od najvećih internetskih sigurnosti propale od strane hakera, koji su također lako pobjegli. Jedini način za suzbijanje takvog kriminala je da ostanemo svjesni kibernetičkih zakona koje imamo danas, koji mogu biti ili putem interneta ili putem web stranica / IT dobavljača. Zakon o informacijskoj tehnologiji mora biti uravnotežen na takav način da se pokaže prestrogim za ljude koji su uključeni u kibernetičke zločine, a istodobno nikada ne bi smio ometati rast internetske industrije.<br/><br/>Autor Bio: – Maneet Puri trenutno vodi kvalitetnu tvrtku za web dizajn koja se nalazi u New Delhiju, Indija.
