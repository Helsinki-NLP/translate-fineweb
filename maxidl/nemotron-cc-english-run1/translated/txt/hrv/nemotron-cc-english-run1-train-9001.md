| UNDERSTANDING SELF-EXECUTING TREATIES VIA STATE PRACTICE<br/><br/>Updated: Feb 2<br/><br/>Introduction:<br/><br/>Consider this paradox, when a country ratifies a treaty, it is said to have consented to accept the treaty in its entirety (reservations and declarations being exceptions); but in some cases, the countries go ahead and refuse to adhere to its provisions. For example, Article VI, Clause 2 of the American Constitution has the provisions that "all treaties … shall be the supreme Law of the Land." Although it is evident that treaties on their own do not have the same effect as federal laws. In truth, they only become operational once these provisions come into force as Federal law with Senate and Presidential approval. Although this is the practice, it is a generally accepted principle in international law that certain treaties have a binding effect on countries. The treaty must fulfil the requirement of being a self-executing treaty to affect the country without any corresponding domestic legislature directly.<br/><br/>This raises the question as to which treaty will qualify as "self-executing" and which will not?<br/><br/>Whether a treaty is a self-executing treaty or not is decided by national judges on a case-to-case basis (Buergenthal, 1992). In order to understand this, the paper will first look at the two types of theories followed by countries on the nature of treaties applying to domestic law. These two theories are monism and dualism. They basically view the framework of domestic and international law as a single hierarchy and two separate hierarchies, respectively (Wildhaber, 1971). Countries following monism believe that certain treaties immediately are binding and immediately have an effect on the country. Once the treaty has been ratified, it can be invoked in national courts and is considered to be a part of the law of the country. Countries following dualism believe that a treaty does not affect domestic law until it has been reinforced by a legislature passed in the parliament. An example of dualism is how the European Convention on Human Rights became operational in the United Kingdom after passing the Human Rights Act 1998 in their parliament (Laws, 2000).<br/><br/>International law is diverse, and so are the types of procedures different countries follow for the acceptance of treaties. Some constitutions' themselves mention the procedures for the ratification of a treaty. Some countries even have different treatment given to international treaty law and customary international law. Certain international organizations like the European Union often affect the domestic law of its member states. The member states of the European Union have to give effect to certain forms of community legislature. Although, it has an essential difference from self-executing treaties. The difference is that it is not for national judges to decide whether the provisions are self-executing or not, but rather for the European Court of Justice to interpret under its constitutive treaties. Other forms of international law formed via resolutions or such might not have the same effect for these states. Nevertheless, they might consider them as forms of "soft law" and look into them to interpret the intent of the law. Sometimes, proclamations made by the judicial organs of international organizations such as the Inter-American Court of Human Rights affect their member states. Although these proclamations are not binding on the member states, the national judges seem to refer to these for authoritative interpretation.<br/><br/>Therefore, a case-to-case approach must be taken while analyzing the procedures and precedents set in different countries. To examine the concept of self-executing treaties, this paper will compare the precedents set by different jurisdictions. If the reader wishes to conduct a similar analysis, they can do so by looking into the different national yearbooks on international law. Mostly, these yearbooks will have a section devoted to the relationship between international and national law.<br/><br/>International Jurisprudence:<br/><br/>The most significant issue that comes up for national courts is whether the treaty is self-executing? If the treaty can be applied without any additional domestic legislature having passed to reinforce it. This question came up in the case of Czesław S v State Treasury and Minister of the State Treasury, wherein the Polish Constitutional Court held that since the treaty provisions referred to domestic measures to be taken, the treaty was not self-executing in nature (Bug river claims, Czesław S v State Treasury and Minister of the State Treasury, 2003). Essentially, when the treaty refers to domestic measures to be taken, it does not in itself create new obligations. It instead reinforces the treaty's intent for the domestic legal process to take measures for the same. A similar issue was raised in the Sosa case in the United States of America. In this case, the court considered whether the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights was a self-executing treaty. The American Supreme Court has also declared that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is not a self-executing treaty (Court, 2004). The Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland also examined the self-executing nature of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The issue before the court was whether Article 13(2)(b) and (c) were self-executing in nature. The court examined whether the treaty was partially self-executing and did so by checking whether there existed a minimum core content for the treaty to be applicable. The court held that it found no such provision within the treaty (A and B v Government of the Canton of Zurich, 2000).<br/><br/>It is essential to understand that these issues differ from the fundamental question of whether international law can be applied as part of the law of the land? In order to answer this question, the paper will examine the judgement by the Supreme Court of the Dominican Republic. The Supreme Court stated that Article 3 of the Dominican Republic's Constitution made international law binding on the domestic legal order. The court rejected the Superior Land Court's interpretation that these treaties were "foreign legislature" and not part of the domestic legal order. The Supreme Court laid down that all treaties ratified by the Dominican Republic formed a part of Dominican Law and, therefore, can be termed as self-executing (Gallardo Montilla v Gallardo Concepción and ors, 1997). The Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland has examined whether the Libson Treaty was self-executing and directly applicable to Swiss Universities. The court held, "According to relevant case law, a treaty norm is directly applicable if its content is sufficiently precise and clear to form the basis of a decision in a particular case. The norm thus has to be justiciable, i.e. define the rights and obligations of an individual and be directed at the competent authorities" (X v University of Lucerne, 2014). This implies that whether the treaty is directly applicable or not, depends upon on whether the norm is justiciable. The Lisbon Treaty is based on the principle of qualifications acquired aboard. This is conveyed through Article IV (1) of the treaty. The purpose of this was to create an obligation for states to show that their decision-making process is fair, transparent and non-discriminatory. The responsibility for proving that the applicant has not met the required criteria is on the "body undertaking the assessment." The treaty guarantees procedural safeguards, which are generally accepted by countries and hence, the court held this treaty to be self-executing. This goes on to showcase the different interpretations undertaken by the courts of various countries.<br/><br/>It is essential to observe whether the norms set out by treaties are actually being complied with. The case laws from various jurisdictions have emphasized that national courts are the final authority on the issue of whether a treaty is self-executing. There is also an inherent duty cast on countries for the observance and due performance of treaties. Such is cast by the Pacta Sunt Servanda rule as enshrined within Article 26 of the Vienna Convention on Law of Treaties (VCLT). Article 27 goes on to reinforce it by stating that international law obligations cannot be ignored by using domestic law as a justification. Many countries' courts have used this as a source of interpretation, such as the Latvian Constitutional Court. In the case of a national norm conflicting with an international norm, the court held that the national norm was null and void. To reach its conclusion, the court strongly relied on the necessary performance of treaties in good faith as envisaged in Article 26 of the VCLT (Linija v Latvia, 2004).<br/><br/>Conclusion:<br/><br/>From the above, it is clear that treaties have particular requirements before they can be considered self-executing. However, keeping all of these aside, the most important still remains the national courts' interpretation. The national courts decide whether the treaty can be called self-executing or not. Although their Constitution's might contain a provision regarding treaty law being the supreme law of the land, courts from different countries interpret these provisions in different manners. This can be seen as to how the American and Dominican Constitutions' both contain these provisions but follow completely different interpretations of the same. The term "self-executing" may not be congruous for these treaties since, in practice, they still need approval from the national courts. Ideally, the way forward should be that countries acknowledge the self-executing nature of treaties and treat them in a fashion wherein Article 26 and 27 of the VCLT are respected. Again, this is the "ideal" situation and is not likely to find its way into state practice of certain jurisdictions anytime soon. Still, hope can be gained via looking into the interpretations of national courts that respect these norms and hopefully pave the way for other courts to acknowledge this.<br/><br/>References:<br/><br/>Buergenthal, T.

Na primjer, članak VI, klauzula 2 američkog Ustava ima odredbe da "svi ugovori ... će biti vrhovni zakon zemlje." Iako je očito da ugovori sami po sebi nemaju isti učinak kao savezni zakoni. Zapravo, one postaju operativne tek nakon što ove odredbe stupe na snagu kao savezni zakon uz odobrenje Senata i predsjednika. Iako je to praksa, opće je prihvaćeno načelo u međunarodnom pravu da određeni ugovori imaju obvezujući učinak na zemlje. Ugovor mora ispuniti uvjet da bude ugovor koji se sam izvršava kako bi izravno utjecao na zemlju bez odgovarajućeg domaćeg zakonodavstva.<br/><br/>To postavlja pitanje o tome koji će se ugovor kvalificirati kao "samoprovođenje", a koji neće?<br/><br/>O tome je li ugovor ugovor koji se sam izvršava ili ne odlučuju nacionalni suci od slučaja do slučaja (Buergenthal, 1992.). Kako bi se to razumjelo, u radu će se najprije razmotriti dvije vrste teorija koje slijede zemlje o prirodi ugovora koji se primjenjuju na domaće pravo. Ove dvije teorije su monizam i dualizam. U osnovi gledaju na okvir domaćeg i međunarodnog prava kao na jednu hijerarhiju, odnosno dvije odvojene hijerarhije (Wildhaber, 1971). Zemlje koje slijede monizam vjeruju da su određeni ugovori odmah obvezujući i odmah utječu na zemlju. Nakon što je ugovor ratificiran, može se pozvati na nacionalne sudove i smatra se dijelom zakona zemlje. Zemlje koje slijede dualizam vjeruju da ugovor ne utječe na domaće zakonodavstvo dok ga ne ojača zakonodavstvo usvojeno u parlamentu. Primjer dualizma je kako je Europska konvencija o ljudskim pravima postala operativna u Ujedinjenom Kraljevstvu nakon donošenja Zakona o ljudskim pravima 1998. u njihovom parlamentu (Zakoni, 2000.).<br/><br/>Međunarodno pravo je raznoliko, kao i vrste postupaka koje različite zemlje slijede za prihvaćanje ugovora. Neki ustavovi sami spominju postupke za ratifikaciju ugovora. Neke zemlje čak imaju različit tretman međunarodnog ugovornog prava i uobičajenog međunarodnog prava. Određene međunarodne organizacije kao što je Europska unija često utječu na domaće pravo svojih država članica. Države članice Europske unije moraju provesti određene oblike zakonodavstva Zajednice. Iako, ona ima bitnu razliku od samoprovodećih ugovora. Razlika je u tome što nije na nacionalnim sucima da odlučuju o tome jesu li odredbe samoprovedljive ili ne, nego je na Europskom sudu pravde da ih tumači u skladu sa svojim osnivačkim ugovorima. Drugi oblici međunarodnog prava formirani rezolucijama ili takvima možda neće imati isti učinak za ove države. Ipak, oni bi ih mogli smatrati oblicima "mekog prava" i pogledati ih kako bi tumačili namjeru zakona. Ponekad proklamacije pravosudnih tijela međunarodnih organizacija kao što je Međuamerički sud za ljudska prava utječu na njihove države članice. Iako ove objave nisu obvezujuće za države članice, čini se da se nacionalni suci na njih pozivaju radi autoritativnog tumačenja.<br/><br/>Stoga se mora primijeniti pristup od slučaja do slučaja pri analizi postupaka i presedana postavljenih u različitim zemljama. Kako bi se ispitao koncept samoprovedbe ugovora, u ovom radu će se usporediti presedani postavljeni od strane različitih jurisdikcija. Ako čitatelj želi provesti sličnu analizu, to može učiniti gledajući u različite nacionalne godišnjake o međunarodnom pravu. Uglavnom, ti godišnjaci će imati dio posvećen odnosu između međunarodnog i nacionalnog prava.<br/><br/>Međunarodna sudska praksa:<br/><br/>Najvažnije pitanje koje se postavlja nacionalnim sudovima je je li ugovor samoprovedba? Ako se ugovor može primijeniti bez dodatnog domaćeg zakonodavstva koje je donijelo da ga ojača. To se pitanje pojavilo u predmetu Czesław S protiv državne riznice i ministra državne riznice, u kojem je poljski Ustavni sud presudio da, budući da se odredbe Ugovora odnose na domaće mjere koje treba poduzeti, ugovor nije bio samoprovedbene prirode (tvrdi Bug River, Czesław S protiv državne riznice i ministar državne riznice, 2003.). U osnovi, kada se Ugovor odnosi na domaće mjere koje treba poduzeti, on sam po sebi ne stvara nove obveze. Umjesto toga, on jača namjeru Ugovora da domaći pravni proces poduzme mjere za isto. Slično pitanje postavljeno je u predmetu Sosa u Sjedinjenim Američkim Državama. U ovom slučaju sud je razmotrio je li Međunarodni pakt o građanskim i političkim pravima samoprovedbeni ugovor. Američki Vrhovni sud također je proglasio da Međunarodni pakt o građanskim i političkim pravima nije ugovor koji se sam izvršava (Sud, 2004.). Savezni vrhovni sud Švicarske također je ispitao samoizvršnu prirodu Međunarodnog pakta o građanskim i političkim pravima. Pitanje pred sudom bilo je jesu li članak 13. stavak 2. točke (b) i (c) samoizvršne prirode. Sud je ispitao je li ugovor djelomično samoprovođenje i provjerio je li postojao minimalni temeljni sadržaj ugovora koji bi se primjenjivao. Sud je presudio da nije pronašao takvu odredbu unutar Ugovora (A i B protiv Vlade kantona Zürich, 2000.).<br/><br/>Bitno je shvatiti da se ta pitanja razlikuju od temeljnog pitanja može li se međunarodno pravo primijeniti kao dio prava zemlje? Kako bi se odgovorilo na ovo pitanje, rad će ispitati presudu Vrhovnog suda Dominikanske Republike. Vrhovni sud je naveo da članak 3. Ustava Dominikanske Republike čini međunarodno pravo obvezujućim za domaći pravni poredak. Sud je odbacio tumačenje Višeg zemaljskog suda da su ti ugovori "strani zakonodavac", a ne dio domaćeg pravnog poretka. Vrhovni sud je utvrdio da su svi ugovori koje je ratificirala Dominikanska Republika sastavni dio dominikanskog zakona i stoga se mogu nazvati samoizvršnim (Gallardo Montilla v Gallardo Concepción et ors, 1997). Savezni vrhovni sud Švicarske ispitao je je li Libsonski ugovor samoprovedljiv i izravno primjenjiv na švicarska sveučilišta. Prema relevantnoj sudskoj praksi, ugovorna norma izravno se primjenjuje ako je njezin sadržaj dovoljno precizan i jasan da bude temelj odluke u određenom slučaju. Norma stoga mora biti podložna pravnom postupku, odnosno definirati prava i obveze pojedinca te biti upućena nadležnim tijelima" (X protiv Sveučilišta u Lucernu, 2014.). To podrazumijeva da je li ugovor izravno primjenjiv ili ne, ovisi o tome je li norma podložna pravnom postupku. Lisabonski ugovor temelji se na načelu kvalifikacija stečenih na brodu. To se prenosi kroz članak IV (1) Ugovora. Svrha je bila stvoriti obvezu za države da pokažu da je njihov postupak donošenja odluka pošten, transparentan i nediskriminirajući. Odgovornost za dokazivanje da podnositelj zahtjeva nije ispunio tražene kriterije leži na „tijelu koje provodi procjenu”. Ugovorom se jamče postupovne zaštitne mjere, koje su općenito prihvaćene od strane zemalja i stoga je sud smatrao da je ovaj ugovor samoprovedba. To dalje pokazuje različite interpretacije koje poduzimaju sudovi različitih zemalja.<br/><br/>Bitno je promatrati poštuju li se norme utvrđene ugovorima. U sudskim propisima iz različitih jurisdikcija naglašeno je da su nacionalni sudovi konačni autoritet u pitanju je li ugovor samoprovođenje. Tu je također inherentna dužnost staviti na zemlje za poštovanje i propisno izvršenje ugovora. Takva je stavljena na temelju pravila Pacta Sunt Servanda kako je utvrđeno u članku 26. Bečke konvencije o pravu ugovora (VCLT). Članak 27. nastavlja ga ojačati navodeći da se obveze međunarodnog prava ne mogu zanemariti korištenjem domaćeg prava kao opravdanja. Sudovi mnogih zemalja koristili su to kao izvor tumačenja, kao što je Ustavni sud Latvije. U slučaju nacionalne norme koja je u suprotnosti s međunarodnom normom, sud je presudio da je nacionalna norma ništavna. Kako bi donio svoj zaključak, Sud se snažno oslanjao na nužno izvršenje ugovora u dobroj vjeri kako je predviđeno člankom 26. VCLT-a (Linija protiv Latvije, 2004.).<br/><br/>Zaključak:<br/><br/>Iz gore navedenog jasno je da ugovori imaju posebne zahtjeve prije nego što se mogu smatrati samoprovedbom. Međutim, ako se sve to zanemari, najvažnije još uvijek ostaje tumačenje nacionalnih sudova. Nacionalni sudovi odlučuju može li se ugovor nazvati samoprovođenjem ili ne. Iako njihov Ustav može sadržavati odredbu prema kojoj je ugovorno pravo vrhovni zakon zemlje, sudovi iz različitih zemalja tumače te odredbe na različite načine. To se može vidjeti iz načina na koji američki i dominikanski ustav sadrže te odredbe, ali slijede potpuno različita tumačenja iste. Izraz „samoizvršenje” možda nije u skladu s tim ugovorima jer u praksi još uvijek trebaju odobrenje nacionalnih sudova. U idealnom slučaju, napredak bi trebao biti u tome da zemlje priznaju samoprovedbenu prirodu ugovora i postupaju s njima na način da se poštuju članci 26. i 27. Opet, ovo je "idealna" situacija i nije vjerojatno da će uskoro pronaći svoj put u državnu praksu određenih jurisdikcija. Ipak, nada se može steći proučavanjem tumačenja nacionalnih sudova koji poštuju te norme i nadamo se da će otvoriti put drugim sudovima da to priznaju.<br/><br/>Reference:<br/><br/>Buergenthal, T.

| Behind-the-Scenes Tragedies That Affected the Cast of TV's Deadliest Catch<br/><br/>Lowered Fishing Quotas<br/><br/>Even though the crew on Deadliest Catch make the majority of their money from Discovery, that doesn't mean they don't actually sell their haul. So, you could say they have two sources of income, which is something that most people in their line of work don't have.<br/><br/>However, back in 2017, the Alaska Department of Fish and Game started a quota system, which limited the amount of fish any fishing boat could bring back to shore by half. That meant the crew on Deadliest Catch experienced a huge drop in profits for several years. Hey, at least they have Discovery to pay the bills, right? | Tragedije iza kulisa koje su utjecale na glumce najsmrtonosnijeg televizijskog ulova<br/><br/>Smanjene ribolovne kvote<br/><br/>Iako posada na Deadliest Catch zarađuje većinu svog novca od Discoveryja, to ne znači da zapravo ne prodaju svoj ulov. Dakle, mogli biste reći da imaju dva izvora prihoda, što je nešto što većina ljudi u njihovom poslu nema.<br/><br/>Međutim, 2017. godine Odjel za ribu i divljač Aljaske pokrenuo je sustav kvota, koji je ograničio količinu ribe koju bi bilo koji ribarski brod mogao vratiti na obalu za pola. To je značilo da je posada na "Najsmrtonosnijem ulovu" doživjela ogroman pad profita već nekoliko godina. |

| BLOGS<br/><br/>Check out our collection of blogs written by fellow staff members.<br/><br/>INFORMATIONAL BLOGS<br/><br/>Don't Stress It<br/><br/>by<br/>Kristen Hogan<br/>&#124; Nov 12, 2020<br/><br/>Stress, no matter how great things are going, it can always find a way to rear its ugly head. Whether it is a last-minute job request or a paper that you forgot to write and it is due the next day, stress can always find a way into your day if you allow it. Today I will show you a few things you can do to eliminate or prevent stress.<br/><br/>The first thing you can do is to exercise. Exercising is a great way to relieve stress because it lowers the stress hormone in your body known as cortisol. The lower levels of cortisol in your body, the lower your stress level will be. Exercise can also increase your confidence, and when your confidence is up then your stress is usually down. For me, when I get stressed, I always exercise by going to the gym and practice boxing, it helps me burn calories and reduce stress while having fun.<br/><br/>Writing things down has been a way to calm people down for a very long time, and it is the next topic on our list. Writing down what is making you stressed is a way to clear the mind, and it helps get rid of stress as well. I have a similar experience when writing stories, usually if I cannot think of a new idea because of an old one, I will write the old idea down and think on it. That is when new ideas start to spring up and I can continue writing normally. It is the same with stress. Think about a stream it continues to flow down it's path until it hits a beaver dam, and that dam blocks the flow of water and everything starts to build up. The only way to get the water flow back to normal is to remove the dam. This is where writing comes in. When you write it down, you are removing stress piece by piece until you can think normally again.<br/><br/>Stress can come into our lives through doors in our life that we keep open. Procrastination is a way that we can leave the doors open for stress. Waiting until tomorrow may be fun for today, but it will hurt you tomorrow, and is a very short-sighted solution. The longer you wait to do something, the larger that something becomes, and the larger it becomes the more stress you will be inviting into your life. Taking care of something as soon as we receive it is a great way to prevent stress, but it is something that takes great discipline to do. The more you cut Procrastination out of your life, the more stress free you will be. So shut that door, you're letting all the cold air out.<br/><br/>So let's review: Exercise, Write down what is stressing you, and Do not Procrastinate. These are only a few ways to relieve stress but to me, they are the most effective. While I know these may not work for everyone I would like to invite anyone feeling stressed to research how to get rid of it. | BLOGOVI<br/><br/>Pogledajte našu zbirku blogova koje su napisali članovi osoblja.<br/><br/>INFORMATIVNI BLOG<br/><br/>Ne naglašavajte<br/><br/>od strane<br/>Kristen Hogan<br/>&#124; Studenog 12, 2020<br/><br/>Stres, bez obzira na to koliko velike stvari idu, uvijek može pronaći način da podigne svoju ružnu glavu. Bilo da se radi o zahtjevu za posao u zadnji trenutak ili papiru koji ste zaboravili napisati i to je zbog sljedećeg dana, stres uvijek može pronaći put u svoj dan ako to dopustite. Danas ću vam pokazati nekoliko stvari koje možete učiniti kako biste uklonili ili spriječili stres.<br/><br/>Prva stvar koju možete učiniti je vježbati. Vježbanje je odličan način za ublažavanje stresa, jer snižava hormon stresa u vašem tijelu poznat kao kortizol. Niža razina kortizola u vašem tijelu, niža razina stresa će biti. Vježba također može povećati vaše samopouzdanje, a kada je vaše samopouzdanje gore onda je vaš stres obično dolje. Za mene, kada sam pod stresom, uvijek vježbam odlaskom u teretanu i vježbanjem boksa, pomaže mi sagorijevati kalorije i smanjiti stres dok se zabavljam.<br/><br/>Pisanje stvari je bio način da se smiri ljude za vrlo dugo vremena, a to je sljedeća tema na našoj listi. Pisanje ono što vas čini pod stresom je način da se očisti um, a to pomaže da biste dobili osloboditi od stresa kao dobro. Imam slično iskustvo kada pišem priče, obično ako ne mogu smisliti novu ideju zbog stare, napisat ću staru ideju i razmišljati o njoj. Tada se počnu javljati nove ideje i mogu nastaviti normalno pisati. Isto je i sa stresom. Razmislite o potoku koji nastavlja teći niz svoj put dok ne udari u branu od dabra, a ta brana blokira protok vode i sve počinje da se nakuplja. Jedini način da se protok vode vrati u normalu je uklanjanje brane. Ovo je mjesto gdje dolazi pisanje. Kada ga zapišete, uklanjate stres komad po komad dok ne možete ponovno normalno razmišljati.<br/><br/>Stres može ući u naše živote kroz vrata u našem životu koje držimo otvorenim. Odugovlačenje je način na koji možemo ostaviti vrata otvorena za stres. Čekanje do sutra može biti zabavno za danas, ali će vas povrijediti sutra, a to je vrlo kratkovidno rješenje. Što duže čekate da nešto učinite, to će nešto postati veće, a što bude veće, to ćete više stresa pozvati u svoj život. Briga o nečemu čim ga primimo odličan je način za sprječavanje stresa, ali to je nešto što zahtijeva veliku disciplinu. Što više odugovlačenja izbacite iz svog života, to ćete biti slobodniji od stresa. Zatvori ta vrata, ispuštaš sav hladan zrak.<br/><br/>Zato pregledajmo: Vježbajte, Zapišite što vas naglašava i nemojte odgađati. Ovo su samo nekoliko načina za ublažavanje stresa, ali za mene su najučinkovitiji. Iako znam da to možda neće raditi za svakoga, želio bih pozvati svakoga tko se osjeća pod stresom da istraži kako ga se riješiti. |
