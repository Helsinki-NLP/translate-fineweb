| There is a well known quote by Plato who once said: "I would teach children music, physics and philosophy, but most importantly music for the patterns in music and all the arts are the keys to learning.<br/><br/>Whatever your religion or culture music will always play and important part. It often defines what is essentially unique about a particular group of people and helps to create a sense of community. Dr Shinichi Suzuki describes his teaching this way: 'Teaching music is not my main purpose. I want to make good citizens. If a child hears fine music from the day of his birth and learns to play it himself, he develops sensitivity, discipline and endurance. He gets a beautiful heart. Along with improving self-esteem and self-expression their are also benefits that include increasing memory and is believed that learning music can boost academic achievement. Although the exact mechanics of this is often not understood, the belief is that learning music stimulates parts of the brain that then have a carry-over impact on all academic areas.<br/><br/>Research indicates that the brain of a musician, even a young one works differently than that of a non-musician. In the field of Neuroscience research has shown that a larger proportion of neural pathways are used in learning music as the brain has to work harder.<br/><br/>There is a link between this and improved spacial-temporal skills that help in solving multistep problems such as in the fields of maths, engineering and the arts.<br/><br/>It also provides structure and focus which may benefit other areas of learning. As well as bringing, structure, organisation and discipline which carries over into other areas of your childs life we must not forget the most important fact about learning music. It brings enjoyment and a sense of fun. | Platon je jednom rekao: "Ja bih podučavao djecu glazbi, fizici i filozofiji, ali najvažnije, glazba za uzorke u glazbi i svim umjetnostima su ključevi za učenje.<br/><br/>Bez obzira na vašu religiju ili kulturu, glazba će uvijek igrati važnu ulogu. Često definira ono što je u biti jedinstveno o određenoj skupini ljudi i pomaže stvoriti osjećaj zajedništva. Dr. Shinichi Suzuki ovako opisuje svoje podučavanje: "Podučavanje glazbe nije moja glavna svrha. Želim napraviti dobre građane. Ako dijete čuje dobru glazbu od dana rođenja i nauči je svirati, razvija osjetljivost, disciplinu i izdržljivost. On dobiva lijepo srce. Uz poboljšanje samopoštovanja i samoizražavanja njihove su i prednosti koje uključuju povećanje pamćenja i vjeruje se da učenje glazbe može povećati akademska postignuća. Iako se točna mehanika toga često ne razumije, uvjerenje je da učenje glazbe potiče dijelove mozga koji tada imaju učinak prijenosa na sva akademska područja.<br/><br/>Istraživanja pokazuju da mozak glazbenika, čak i mladog, funkcionira drugačije od mozga ne-glazbenika. U području neuroznanosti istraživanja su pokazala da se veći udio neuronskih puteva koristi u učenju glazbe jer mozak mora raditi više.<br/><br/>Postoji veza između toga i poboljšanih prostorno-vremenskih vještina koje pomažu u rješavanju višestepenih problema kao što su na području matematike, inženjerstva i umjetnosti.<br/><br/>Također pruža strukturu i fokus koji može koristiti drugim područjima učenja. Osim što donosimo strukturu, organizaciju i disciplinu koja se prenosi u druga područja života vašeg djeteta, ne smijemo zaboraviti najvažniju činjenicu o učenju glazbe. Ona donosi užitak i osjećaj zabave. |

| Breaking out of the Box Fay Tsitou investigates moving objects in British museums<br/><br/>Objects are the main 'protagonists' in two different fields: museums and puppetry. In both cases, the objects enable us to interact with our surroundings, our past, and our inner self.<br/><br/>Museum visitors perceive a vast majority of the museum objects from a distance, while these remain mainly static and mute in or outside the galleries' showcases. On the other hand, puppet theatre audiences join the world of moving objects/puppets that are often literally given a voice (sound or speech). Nevertheless, is there a common ground of static and moving objects worth exploring in these contexts?<br/><br/>Museum Puppetry Research<br/><br/>Museum puppetry adopts the language of puppetry within museum exhibitions. It aims at investigating the interaction among museum visitors, objects' stories, exhibits' histories and exhibitions' narratives. It examines how object-centred activities discretely disguise their visitor-centred identity while they enable visitors to free their mind and heart from possible inhibitions or preconceptions. Museum puppetry is a type of museum learning activity, similar to and often combined with museum theatre. However, as G.B. Shaw might say, 'the actor in his primitive form' (i.e. the puppet) unblocks the audiences' imagination which '…plays a far greater part than the exertions of the actors'.<br/><br/>Museum puppetry examples in UK<br/><br/>There are a number of variables that characterise a museum puppetry activity, such as the type of museum, the type of puppetry, the target group, the activity area in the museum, the degree of interaction among the four units (participants, exhibits/collections, puppets, practitioners), the use of verbal and/or object language. For instance, one type of activity could be a complete show around a museum's performing object, as for example in the Keswick museum in Cumbria where Ali Mc Caw presented a wayang kulit style performance, The Musical Stonemason. The show combined shadow and table-top puppetry with a gamelan orchestra which incorporated a museum object, the musical stone of Skiddaw. Moreover, shows can be related to an exhibit's narrative. For example Professor Geoff Felix's popular Punch and Judy street puppet theatre show was presented in the garden of the Geoffrey Museum and at the Museum of London as part of the Victoria Street exhibit (It is no surprise to learn that Felix's beautifully crafted booth was once mistaken for an exhibit as it was standing in an open area at the same museum!)<br/><br/>Other examples include:<br/><br/>A workshop on puppet construction and manipulation - like the skilfully structured workshop that follows Anna Ingleby's shadow puppetry shows<br/><br/>A puppet workshop based on the museum's handling collection - as this happens at the Horniman Museum (London) to acquaint primary school students with the various types of puppets<br/><br/>A puppet exhibit - like the automata or the dinosaur animatronics in the Natural History Museum in London<br/><br/>Creative learning processes with the use of everyday objects - as these are facilitated by Hedsor Creative Learning, to enhance museum interpretation in places such as Sheffield Museums and Galleries Trust and Manchester City Art Gallery<br/><br/>A museum tour with the puppet as a storyteller/facilitator - like Vivien Mousdell's palaeontologist Dr. Ambrose in her puppet show Fossils Alive<br/><br/>An outreach programme - like Jill Webster's interactive puppet show Pirates! All Hands on Deck!, commissioned by Glasgow Science Centre<br/><br/>Manipulation of puppets that belong to original collections is considered par excellence a museum puppetry case - as John Mc Cormick performed with the Victorian Marionettes at the Museum Theatre in London.<br/><br/>The following cases further illuminate the multifaceted potential of performing objects in museums.<br/><br/>'Authentic' metaphors<br/><br/>For twenty-five years adult museum visitors have been enjoying Robert Poulter's New Model Theatre shows in conjunction with special exhibitions and collections, in numerous European and US museums. During Poulter's sophisticated toy theatre shows, paper figures travel smoothly in time and space while interacting with each other and their stage environment. Backdrops are changing continuously. The audience perceives the world represented on stage neither as something static, nor fragmented, but fluidly constructed moment by moment. Although puppetry favours mythological and fictional stories, Poulter makes use of his talent in painting and research skills to interpret selectively historical evidence via flat figures and settings that move vertically and horizontally. The elaborate, live montage evolves as fast and as easy, as the turning of a page. For example, during the art history show Mr Turner Gets Steamed Up, action moves instantly from Margate to London, or from the view out of Turner's window onto the canvas of his famous paintings. The liberties taken with the spoken and visual narrative are noted in detail on the program of the show, allowing Poulter's beautifully crafted paper figures to stand bravely as ultimate 'authentic' metaphors on a miniature stage of History.<br/><br/>Multi-sensory experience<br/><br/>Real coffee beans, shells and cloves cover small wooden boats which sail in a Museum of Docklands' performance originally devised for visitors with the most complex educational needs. The boats' cargo can be smelled and felt as they (metaphorically) travel over the sea to London's Victorian docks in a storytelling piece entitled Over the Sea to London, devised by Emily Capstick and Alison Hale (Peoplescape Theatre). Peoplescape have been creating participatory performances in community, education and museum settings for twelve years. Taking advantage of applied theatre techniques, live music and puppetry's rich potential and flexibility, Capstick and Hale replace verbal description of the past with live action in the present. They create a multi-sensory engaging experience for an audience in-role role with the use of puppets and manipulated objects, without relying on verbal communication.<br/><br/>Popular art<br/><br/>Last year, Dr Matthew Isaac Cohen, as a dhalang shadow puppeteer performed his Ramayana in four parts with the Southbank Gamelan Players at the British Library, where an exhibition under the same title explored how the Indian epic story is retold over the centuries. Similarly to a presentation to an Indonesian audience (who enjoy a great deal of freedom in watching the popular story – spectators can move around, take a nap, leave the show and return!), the Library's audience could watch the nearly three-hour performance seated on pillows or circulating around it. During the show, the spectators could also either move towards the exhibition area to enjoy a museum experience while still hearing the superb chanting and music, or they could go behind the screen and the performers to have a drink while still enjoying the delightful puppet show from the back, viewed through a door opening. While standing in the middle, the wayang kulit Indonesian type of shadow puppetry created an intimate in-between space bridging two worlds: art and life.<br/><br/>Two remarkable cases outside UK<br/><br/>In 2002, a Brooklyn-based constructor/puppeteer, Chris Green, was commissioned to create a part of Noah's Ark exhibit in the Skirball Cultural Center in LA. His sophisticated kinetic or fully manipulated installations – interactive exhibits and puppets manipulated by the museum staff – were made of recycled materials and today attract people of all ages and backgrounds. The Noah's Ark exhibit received awards of excellence from the American Association of Museums and Themed Entertainment Association.<br/><br/>In 2001, the renowned French director Philippe Philippe Genty presented Le Concert Incroyable in the Grande Salle de l' Evolution in the Natural History Museum of Paris. High technology projections of inventive graphic designs were used and interacted with the central exhibit of the gallery: a march that consisted of large mummified animals. This puppet and physical theatre show was a composition of mesmerising images, dramatic action and chorus singing; a unique experience for an adult audience.<br/><br/>So, as we can see museum puppetry embraces a far broader spectrum of practice than might at first be thought! To perceive museums as just another sort of venue, and museum puppetry as a merely a medium suitable to attract preschoolers with their families during Christmas period, is limiting. Recognising the performing objects' potential and communicative power, some museums support their use for their activities and learning programmes year-round.<br/><br/>In fact, these are the museums that foster a close relation between the two inanimate 'soul brothers': museum exhibits and performing objects. In the hands of the experts, such interactions give an extra meaning to an old mystery: '…Inanimate objects / have you then a soul / That clings to our soul / and forces it to love?...' (Alphonse Lamartine, Milly ou la terre natale, 1822)<br/><br/>George Bernard Shaw quotation is taken from his introduction to Max Von Boehn's Puppets and Automata (Dover Publications. New York, 1972, trans. Josephine Nicoll) | Probijanje iz kutije Fay Tsitou istražuje pokretne predmete u britanskim muzejima<br/><br/>Objekti su glavni 'protagonisti' u dva različita područja: muzejima i lutkarstvu. U oba slučaja, objekti nam omogućuju interakciju s našim okruženjem, našom prošlošću i našim unutarnjim ja.<br/><br/>Posjetitelji muzeja uočavaju veliku većinu muzejskih predmeta iz daljine, dok oni ostaju uglavnom statični i nijemi u ili izvan izloga galerija. S druge strane, gledatelji kazališta lutaka pridružuju se svijetu pokretnih objekata/lutaka kojima se često doslovno daje glas (zvuk ili govor). Ipak, postoji li zajedničko tlo statičnih i pokretnih objekata koje je vrijedno istražiti u tim kontekstima?<br/><br/>Muzej lutkarstva Istraživanje<br/><br/>Muzejsko lutkarstvo usvaja jezik lutkarstva u okviru muzejskih izložbi. Cilj mu je istražiti interakciju među posjetiteljima muzeja, priče predmeta, povijesti izložbi i narative izložbi. Istražuje kako aktivnosti usmjerene na objekt diskretno prikrivaju svoj identitet usmjeren na posjetitelje, a posjetiteljima omogućuju da oslobode svoj um i srce od mogućih inhibicija ili predrasuda. Muzejsko lutkarstvo je vrsta muzejske aktivnosti učenja, slično i često u kombinaciji s muzejskim kazalištem. Međutim, kako bi G.B. Shaw mogao reći, 'glumac u svom primitivnom obliku' (tj. lutka) odblokira maštu publike koja '...igra daleko veći dio od napora glumaca'.<br/><br/>Primjeri muzejskih lutaka u Velikoj Britaniji<br/><br/>Postoji niz varijabli koje karakteriziraju muzejsku lutkarsku djelatnost, kao što su vrsta muzeja, vrsta lutkarstva, ciljna skupina, područje aktivnosti u muzeju, stupanj interakcije između četiriju cjelina (sudionici, izložbe/zbirke, lutke, praktičari), upotreba verbalnog i/ili objektnog jezika. Na primjer, jedna vrsta aktivnosti mogla bi biti cjelokupna predstava oko muzejskog izvedbenog objekta, kao što je na primjer u muzeju Keswick u Cumbriji gdje je Ali Mc Caw predstavio izvedbu u stilu Wayang Kulit, Muzički kamenoklesar. Izložba je kombinirala lutkarstvo sjena i stola s orkestrom gamelan koji je uključivao muzejski predmet, glazbeni kamen Skiddaw. Osim toga, predstave se mogu povezati s narativom izložbe. Primjerice, popularna kazališna predstava profesora Geoffa Felixa Puncha i Judy u uličnom kazalištu predstavljena je u vrtu Geoffreyjevog muzeja i u Muzeju u Londonu kao dio izložbe Victoria Street (nije iznenađujuće saznati da je Felixov lijepo izrađeni štand jednom bio zamijenjen izložbom jer je stajao na otvorenom prostoru u istom muzeju!)<br/><br/>Ostali primjeri uključuju:<br/><br/>Radionica o lutkarskoj konstrukciji i manipulaciji - poput vješto strukturirane radionice koja prati prikaze lutkarstva u sjeni Anne Ingleby<br/><br/>Lutkarska radionica temeljena na muzejskoj zbirci rukovanja - kako se to događa u Muzeju Horniman (London) kako bi se učenici osnovnih škola upoznali s različitim vrstama lutaka<br/><br/>Izložba lutaka - poput automata ili animatronike dinosaura u Prirodoslovnom muzeju u Londonu<br/><br/>Kreativni procesi učenja uz korištenje svakodnevnih predmeta - kao što su olakšani od strane Hedsor Creative Learning, kako bi se poboljšalo muzejsko tumačenje na mjestima kao što su Sheffield muzeji i galerije Trust i Manchester City Art Gallery<br/><br/>Obilazak muzeja s lutkom kao pripovjedačem / facilitatorom - poput paleontologinje Vivien Mousdell Dr. Ambrose u njezinoj lutkarskoj predstavi Fosili Živi<br/><br/>Promidžbeni program - poput interaktivne lutkarske emisije Jill Webster Pirates! Sve ruke na palubi!, po narudžbi Znanstvenog centra Glasgow<br/><br/>Manipuliranje lutkama koje pripadaju originalnim zbirkama smatra se par excellence muzejskim lutkarskim slučajem - kao što je John Mc Cormick nastupao s viktorijanskim lutkama u Muzejskom kazalištu u Londonu.<br/><br/>Sljedeći slučajevi dodatno osvjetljavaju višestruki potencijal izvođenja predmeta u muzejima.<br/><br/>'Autentične' metafore<br/><br/>Dvadeset i pet godina posjetitelji muzeja za odrasle uživaju u kazališnim predstavama novog modela Roberta Poultera u kombinaciji s posebnim izložbama i zbirkama, u brojnim europskim i američkim muzejima. Tijekom Poulterovih sofisticiranih kazališnih predstava, papirnate figure glatko putuju u vremenu i prostoru, a u interakciji jedni s drugima i njihovom scenskom okolinom. Pozadine se neprestano mijenjaju. Publika doživljava svijet predstavljen na pozornici ne kao nešto statično, niti fragmentirano, već fluidno konstruirano iz trenutka u trenutak. Iako lutkarstvo favorizira mitološke i fiktivne priče, Poulter koristi svoj talent u slikarstvu i istraživačkim vještinama za selektivno tumačenje povijesnih dokaza putem ravnih figura i postavki koje se kreću okomito i vodoravno. Složena, živa montaža razvija se brzo i jednostavno, kao i okretanje stranice. Na primjer, tijekom izložbe povijesti umjetnosti Mr. Turner Gets Steamed Up, akcija se odmah kreće iz Margatea u London, ili iz pogleda s Turnerovog prozora na platno njegovih poznatih slika. Slobode preuzete s izgovorenim i vizualnim narativom detaljno su zabilježene u programu emisije, dopuštajući Poulterovim lijepo izrađenim papirnatim figurama da hrabro stoje kao krajnje "autentične" metafore na minijaturnoj pozornici povijesti.<br/><br/>Multisenzorno iskustvo<br/><br/>Prava zrna kave, školjke i klinčići pokrivaju male drvene brodice koje plove u izvedbi Muzeja dokova izvorno osmišljene za posjetitelje s najsloženijim obrazovnim potrebama. Teret brodova može se namirisati i osjetiti dok (metaforički) putuju preko mora do londonskih viktorijanskih dokova u pripovjedačkom komadu pod nazivom Over the Sea to London, koji su osmislili Emily Capstick i Alison Hale (Peoplescape Theatre). Peoplescape stvara participativne predstave u zajednici, obrazovanju i muzejskim postavkama već dvanaest godina. Iskorištavajući primijenjene kazališne tehnike, bogati potencijal i fleksibilnost žive glazbe i lutkarstva, Capstick i Hale zamjenjuju verbalni opis prošlosti uživom akcijom u sadašnjosti. Oni stvaraju multisenzorno privlačno iskustvo za publiku u ulozi s korištenjem lutaka i manipuliranih predmeta, bez oslanjanjanja na verbalnu komunikaciju.<br/><br/>Popularna umjetnost<br/><br/>Prošle godine, dr. Matthew Isaac Cohen, kao dhalang lutkar u sjeni, izveo je svoju Ramayanu u četiri dijela s igračima Southbank Gamelan Players u Britanskoj knjižnici, gdje je izložba pod istim naslovom istražila kako je indijska epska priča ispričana tijekom stoljeća. Slično prezentaciji pred indonezijskom publikom (koja uživa veliku slobodu u gledanju popularne priče - gledatelji se mogu kretati, odspavati, napustiti emisiju i vratiti se!), Publika Knjižnice mogla je gledati gotovo trosatnu izvedbu sjedeći na jastucima ili cirkulirajući oko nje. Tijekom predstave, gledatelji su se također mogli premjestiti prema izložbenom prostoru kako bi uživali u muzejskom iskustvu dok još uvijek čuju vrhunsko pjevanje i glazbu, ili su mogli otići iza ekrana i izvođača na piće dok su još uvijek uživali u prekrasnoj lutkarskoj predstavi s leđa, gledajući kroz otvor vrata. Dok je stajao u sredini, indonezijski tip lutkarstva u sjeni stvorio je intimni prostor između dva svijeta: umjetnost i život.<br/><br/>Dva izvanredna slučaja izvan Velike Britanije<br/><br/>Godine 2002., konstruktor/lutkar iz Brooklyna, Chris Green, dobio je zadatak da stvori dio izložbe Noine barke u Kulturnom centru Skirball u LA-u. Njegove sofisticirane kinetičke ili potpuno manipulirane instalacije – interaktivni eksponati i lutke kojima manipulira osoblje muzeja – izrađene su od recikliranih materijala i danas privlače ljude svih dobnih skupina i pozadina. Izložba Noina arka dobila je nagrade za izvrsnost od Američkog udruženja muzeja i tematskog udruženja za zabavu.<br/><br/>Godine 2001. poznati francuski redatelj Philippe Philippe Genty predstavio je Le Concert Incredible u Velikoj dvorani evolucije u Prirodoslovnom muzeju u Parizu. Upotrijebljene su visokotehnološke projekcije inventivnih grafičkih dizajna i interakcija sa središnjim eksponatom galerije: maršom koji se sastojao od velikih mumificiranih životinja. Ova lutkarsko-fizička kazališna predstava bila je kompozicija očaravajućih slika, dramske akcije i zborskog pjevanja; jedinstveno iskustvo za odraslu publiku.<br/><br/>Dakle, kao što možemo vidjeti muzejsko lutkarstvo obuhvaća daleko širi spektar prakse nego što se u početku moglo misliti! Shvaćanje muzeja kao samo još jedne vrste mjesta, a muzejskog lutkarstva kao samo medija prikladnog za privlačenje predškolske djece sa svojim obiteljima tijekom božićnog razdoblja, ograničava. Prepoznajući potencijal i komunikativnu moć predmeta izvedbe, neki muzeji podržavaju njihovo korištenje za svoje aktivnosti i programe učenja tijekom cijele godine.<br/><br/>Zapravo, to su muzeji koji potiču blisku vezu između dvije nežive "braće duše": muzejskih eksponata i izvođenja predmeta. U rukama stručnjaka, takve interakcije daju dodatno značenje staroj misteriji: "... Neživi predmeti / imate li onda dušu / koja se prianja za našu dušu / i prisiljava je da voli?...” (Alphonse Lamartine, Milly ou la terre natale, 1822)<br/><br/>George Bernard Shaw citat je preuzet iz njegovog uvoda u Max von Boehn's Puppets and Automata (Dover Publications. New York, 1972, trans. Josephine Nicoll) |

Almost 20 years later, the challenge of ensuring women's rights remains.<br/><br/>On May 30, the UN Secretary-General's High-Level Panel on the Post-2015 Development Agenda released its report, which contains a standalone goal on gender equality and empowerment of women and girls. In addition, the illustrative health goal contains a target on ensuring universal sexual and reproductive health and rights.<br/><br/>Gender equality and ensuring universal sexual and reproductive health and rights are essential ingredients for sustainable development. We must maintain the momentum gained on these issues in the high-level panel through to the final deliberations at the UN General Assembly in 2014 on global goals for poverty eradication and sustainable development. Now more than ever, we need to recognise the centrality of gender equality. Now more than ever, we must end gender inequality as the grand objective of the 21st century.<br/><br/>Promoting gender equality in the post-2015 agenda includes finishing the work that the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) started. Unfortunately, the MDGs that are most off-track are those directly linked to achieving gender equality, such as reducing maternal mortality and ensuring universal reproductive health and rights. There is by now overwhelming evidence that gender inequality severely constrains women's independence and freedom, control over their own bodies, sexuality and childbearing, and restricts their life choices and opportunities in terms of education and work. There is also abundant evidence that it significantly slows economic growth in both rich and poor countries.<br/><br/>Across the world, in all societies, women and girls consistently face a range of barriers to equality - such as wage gaps, gender-based violence, child marriage and female genital mutilation. The poor and otherwise socially disadvantaged are further marginalised through crippling combinations of gender discrimination and poverty discrimination. Therefore, tackling the gender inequalities and critical barriers that prevent women and girls from exercising their rights and empowering themselves must be at the heart of our efforts to create sustainable, prosperous and resilient societies.<br/><br/>Achieving gender equality - including women's rights, women's health and women's empowerment - is not only a means to eradicating poverty and achieving sustainable development, it is an important end in itself.<br/><br/>Landmark documents such as the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development, and the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action have long established that women's rights are human rights. CEDAW, established in 1979 and ratified by almost every country in the world, places responsibility for ensuring equal rights for men and women with the state. Women must be offered the same access to all aspects of life as men in order to reach equal status.<br/><br/>We have not achieved this yet. Therefore, we are recommending that the UN General Assembly consider effectively tackling this challenge, and the unfinished business of the MDGs, by ensuring that gender equality and sexual and reproductive health are at the centre of the post-2015 development agenda, with relevant goals, targets and indicators approved.<br/><br/>This proposal has strong support among a wide range of stakeholders and development actors, including many governments, multilateral agencies and civil society organisations. The respective national, regional and global thematic consultations on health, inequalities and education in the post-2015 agenda, as well as the Rio+20 outcome document's framework for action and follow-up, have all stressed the centrality of gender equality and women's empowerment.<br/><br/>The MDGs created an unprecedented mobilisation of political will and resources in recent years, not least around MDGs 4 and 5 related to reducing maternal and infant death. Both of these goals are inextricably linked to gender equality and the rights, health and empowerment of women and girls. It is essential for our common efforts regarding these to be carried over and further strengthened in the post-2015 agenda. Including goals on gender equality and sexual and reproductive health and rights in the post-2015 agenda will highlight, once again, the central role of women's rights as human rights. The panel report has given a strong momentum for these issues - now it is up to all of us global actors to maintain it, and make sure that it survives all the way to 2015.<br/><br/>We are at a decisive point in our common history when our policy intentions and actions will shape the future of human development and our planet in the face of both unprecedented achievements and persistent challenges. Let us ensure that the post-2015 agenda is truly universal and inclusive, and that the ultimate goal is a world where all - men, women, young people and children - are treated as equally worthy lens is suitable for general macro work but if you want greater subject-to-lens distance a 100mm lens will give you this at a price.

Gotovo 20 godina kasnije, izazov osiguravanja prava žena ostaje.<br/><br/>Dana 30. svibnja, Panel na visokoj razini glavnog tajnika UN-a za razvojni program nakon 2015. godine objavio je izvješće koje sadrži samostalni cilj o ravnopravnosti spolova i osnaživanju žena i djevojčica. Osim toga, ilustrativni zdravstveni cilj sadrži cilj osiguravanja univerzalnog seksualnog i reproduktivnog zdravlja i prava.<br/><br/>Rodna ravnopravnost i osiguravanje općeg spolnog i reproduktivnog zdravlja i prava ključni su sastojci održivog razvoja. Moramo zadržati zamah stečen na tim pitanjima na panelu na visokoj razini do završnih rasprava na Općoj skupštini UN-a 2014. o globalnim ciljevima iskorjenjivanja siromaštva i održivog razvoja. Sada više nego ikad, moramo priznati središnju ulogu rodne ravnopravnosti. Sada više nego ikada, moramo okončati rodnu nejednakost kao glavni cilj 21. stoljeća.<br/><br/>Promicanje rodne ravnopravnosti u programu za razdoblje nakon 2015. uključuje dovršetak rada koji je započeo Milenijskim razvojnim ciljevima. Nažalost, milenijske razvojne ciljeve koji su najnepovoljniji izravno su povezani s ostvarivanjem rodne ravnopravnosti, kao što su smanjenje smrtnosti majki i osiguravanje univerzalnog reproduktivnog zdravlja i prava. Već sada postoje opsežni dokazi da rodna nejednakost ozbiljno ograničava neovisnost i slobodu žena, kontrolu nad vlastitim tijelom, seksualnost i rađanje te ograničava njihove životne izbore i mogućnosti u pogledu obrazovanja i rada. Postoje i brojni dokazi da značajno usporava gospodarski rast i u bogatim i u siromašnim zemljama.<br/><br/>Širom svijeta, u svim društvima, žene i djevojčice dosljedno se suočavaju s nizom prepreka jednakosti - kao što su razlike u plaćama, rodno uvjetovano nasilje, dječji brakovi i sakaćenje ženskih genitalija. Siromašni i na drugi način socijalno ugroženi dodatno su marginalizirani zbog teških kombinacija rodne diskriminacije i diskriminacije u pogledu siromaštva. Stoga rješavanje rodnih nejednakosti i kritičnih prepreka koje sprečavaju žene i djevojčice da ostvaruju svoja prava i osnažuju se mora biti u središtu naših napora za stvaranje održivih, prosperitetnih i otpornih društava.<br/><br/>Postizanje rodne ravnopravnosti, uključujući prava žena, zdravlje žena i osnaživanje žena, nije samo sredstvo iskorjenjivanja siromaštva i postizanja održivog razvoja, već je i važan cilj sam po sebi.<br/><br/>Iznimni dokumenti kao što su Konvencija o uklanjanju svih oblika diskriminacije žena (CEDAW), Program djelovanja Međunarodne konferencije o stanovništvu i razvoju te Pekinška deklaracija i Platforma za djelovanje odavno su utvrdili da su prava žena ljudska prava. CEDAW, osnovana 1979. godine i ratificirana od strane gotovo svake zemlje na svijetu, stavlja odgovornost za osiguravanje jednakih prava za muškarce i žene s državom. Ženama se mora omogućiti jednak pristup svim aspektima života kao i muškarcima kako bi se postigao jednak status.<br/><br/>To još nismo postigli. Stoga preporučujemo da Opća skupština UN-a razmotri učinkovito rješavanje ovog izazova i nedovršenih poslova Milenijskih razvojnih ciljeva, osiguravajući da rodna ravnopravnost i spolno i reproduktivno zdravlje budu u središtu razvojnog programa nakon 2015., s odgovarajućim ciljevima i pokazateljima koji su odobreni.<br/><br/>Ovaj prijedlog ima snažnu potporu širokog raspona dionika i razvojnih aktera, uključujući mnoge vlade, multilateralne agencije i organizacije civilnog društva. Na odgovarajućim nacionalnim, regionalnim i globalnim tematskim savjetovanjima o zdravlju, nejednakostima i obrazovanju u programu za razdoblje nakon 2015., kao i u okviru za djelovanje i daljnje postupanje u okviru dokumenta Rio+20, naglašena je središnja važnost rodne ravnopravnosti i osnaživanja žena.<br/><br/>Milenijima milenijskih razvojnih ciljeva posljednjih je godina ostvarena neviđena mobilizacija političke volje i resursa, posebice oko Milenijskih razvojnih ciljeva 4. i 5., koji se odnose na smanjenje smrtnosti majki i dojenčadi. Oba su cilja neraskidivo povezana s ravnopravnošću spolova i pravima, zdravljem i osnaživanjem žena i djevojčica. Ključno je da se naši zajednički napori u vezi s tim prenesu i dodatno ojačaju u program nakon 2015. Uključivanjem ciljeva o ravnopravnosti spolova te seksualnom i reproduktivnom zdravlju i pravima u program za razdoblje nakon 2015. ponovno će se naglasiti središnja uloga prava žena kao ljudskih prava. Izvješće panela dalo je snažan zamah tim pitanjima - sada je na svima nama, globalnim akterima, da ga zadržimo i pobrinemo se da preživi sve do 2015.<br/><br/>Nalazimo se u odlučujućoj točki u našoj zajedničkoj povijesti kada će naše političke namjere i postupci oblikovati budućnost ljudskog razvoja i našeg planeta suočenog s dosad neviđenim postignućima i trajnim izazovima. Osigurajmo da je agenda za razdoblje nakon 2015. uistinu univerzalna i uključiva, te da je krajnji cilj svijet u kojem se svi - muškarci, žene, mladi i djeca - tretiraju kao jednako vrijedni objektivi prikladni za opći makro rad, ali ako želite veću udaljenost od objekta do objektiva, objektiv od 100 mm će vam to dati po cijeni.

| How Mobile Games Can Help Improve Sanitation<br/><br/>More than 2.5 billion people, many of them in Africa and South Asia, face grave sanitation challenges. In many of these countries, people are more likely to own a cell phone than a toilet. Therefore there is an obvious opportunity to use mobile technology to promote the use of sanitation and good hygiene in order to make a substantial impact. Mobile phones in Kenya transfer money; Bangladeshis listen to English language classes on their phones; and in Ghana, women entrepreneurs use mobiles to market their wares.<br/><br/>The growing Games for Change industry applies principles of traditional social games to address specific challenges . For example, in the UK, Channel 4 commissioned the game developer Playniac to build an online game to improve financial literacy among the 50% of young Britons who are heavily in debt. In Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, young developers have built iPhone, Android, and Javascript games based on local storylines. Pledge 51, a Nigerian developer group, recently released Danfo, a game where the user plays as a bus driver coping with dense Nigerian traffic.<br/><br/>Hattery Labs has begun to explore how games might improve sanitation practices. The typical game-players in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia are young urban males who own smartphones, but many of the communities that face the greatest sanitation challenges have less advanced technology. However, Javascript games built for Nokia S40 phones (among the most popular handsets in the developing world) provide an opportunity to send a compelling message on good behavior practices in sanitation and hygiene. A full report on how games can promote good sanitation and behavior practice is HERE.<br/><br/>Here are a few game ideas that might prove effective:<br/><br/>Soap Wars makes hand-washing an entertaining challenge where players use the soap dispenser as a weapon against dangerous germs. Sanitation Heroes engages players in the process of sanitation maintenance from capturing, transporting, and disposing of feces to reusing it as fertilizer. It features different scenarios in a memory game that prompts the player to match the solution to each different stage of capturing and treating waste.<br/><br/>Toilet Hunt introduces obstacles along the course of finding a safe place to go to the bathroom. As the player searches for sanitary latrines on a basic map, they must use the clues to decide whether the latrine is safe.<br/><br/>There are outstanding questions that the current research hasn't resolved:<br/><br/>How does the game appeal to illiterate players, who need rich visual descriptions and narratives to guide the gameplay? The need for rich imagery does not necessarily match the small, low-resolution screens of Nokia S40 phones.<br/><br/>How does the game appeal to women, who are critical participants in sanitation but don't represent the largest percentage of mobile game players? One initial idea is to frame sanitation storylines as mobile 'comic books', allowing users to scroll through an interesting narrative with subtle sanitation and hygiene messages.<br/><br/>How can the lessons from the game translate to rural areas, where there are fewer who can access it and more who face the challenges that it seeks to mitigate? Urban users might take their phone with them to their home village and share it with their friends and family, who will begin playing the game and continue to play out the game's storyline in real life.<br/><br/>Finally, how can the game measure its impact on sanitation behavior? User adoption and engagement in this context is a false metric to evaluate impact since users might play the game but have their behavior unchanged. Any solution to measure impact should combine a mobile game with other digital and non-digital applications that help users track their sanitation use alongside their game success. Local developers can work in partnership with games for change experts, community organizations, and telecommunications companies to test these approaches.<br/><br/>This report explores the potential of using mobile games to engage citizens in addressing persistent community challenges but we want to hear from you. Is this an effective way to engage target populations? Are there other ideas for how games can impact behavior change? Would you play these games | Kako mobilne igre mogu pomoći u poboljšanju zdravlja<br/><br/>Više od 2,5 milijarde ljudi, od kojih su mnogi u Africi i Južnoj Aziji, suočavaju se s ozbiljnim izazovima u području sanitarnih uvjeta. U mnogim od tih zemalja, ljudi su više vjerojatno da će posjedovati mobitel nego WC. Stoga postoji očita prilika za korištenje mobilne tehnologije za promicanje upotrebe sanitarnih uvjeta i dobre higijene kako bi se ostvario znatan učinak. Mobilni telefoni u Keniji prenose novac, Bangladešani slušaju satove engleskog jezika na svojim telefonima, a u Gani žene poduzetnice koriste mobilne telefone za prodaju svojih proizvoda.<br/><br/>Rastuća industrija Igre za promjene primjenjuje načela tradicionalnih društvenih igara za rješavanje specifičnih izazova . Na primjer, u Velikoj Britaniji, Channel 4 naručio je razvoj igara Playniac izgraditi online igru kako bi se poboljšala financijska pismenost među 50% mladih Britanaca koji su u velikim dugovima. U subsaharskoj Africi i južnoj Aziji, mladi programeri su napravili iPhone, Android i Javascript igre temeljene na lokalnim pričama. Pledge 51, nigerijska razvojna grupa, nedavno je objavila Danfo, igru u kojoj korisnik igra kao vozač autobusa koji se nosi s gustim nigerijskim prometom.<br/><br/>Hattery Labs je počeo istraživati kako bi igre mogle poboljšati sanitarne prakse. Tipični igrači igara u subsaharskoj Africi i južnoj Aziji su mladi urbani muškarci koji posjeduju pametne telefone, ali mnoge zajednice koje se suočavaju s najvećim sanitarnim izazovima imaju manje napredne tehnologije. Međutim, Javascript igre napravljene za Nokia S40 telefone (među najpopularnijim telefonima u svijetu u razvoju) pružaju priliku da pošalju uvjerljivu poruku o dobrim praksama ponašanja u sanitarnim i higijenskim uvjetima. Potpuno izvješće o tome kako igre mogu promicati dobru praksu sanitarne zaštite i ponašanja nalazi se OVDJE.<br/><br/>Evo nekoliko ideja za igru koje bi se mogle pokazati učinkovitima:<br/><br/>Sapun Wars čini pranje ruku zabavnim izazovom u kojem igrači koriste dozator sapuna kao oružje protiv opasnih mikroba. Sanitation Heroes angažira igrače u procesu održavanja sanitarnih uvjeta od hvatanja, transporta i odlaganja izmeta do ponovnog korištenja kao gnojiva. Ima različite scenarije u memorijskoj igri koja traži od igrača da odgovara rješenju za svaku različitu fazu hvatanja i obrade otpada.<br/><br/>Toilet Hunt uvodi prepreke tijekom pronalaženja sigurnog mjesta za odlazak u kupaonicu. Dok igrač traži sanitarne latrine na osnovnoj karti, moraju koristiti tragove kako bi odlučili je li latrina sigurna.<br/><br/>Postoje otvorena pitanja koja dosadašnja istraživanja nisu riješila:<br/><br/>Kako igra privlači nepismene igrače, kojima su potrebni bogati vizualni opisi i narativi kako bi vodili gameplay? Potreba za bogatim slikama ne mora nužno odgovarati malim zaslonima s niskom razlučivošću telefona Nokia S40.<br/><br/>Kako se igra sviđa ženama, koje su kritični sudionici u sanitarnim uvjetima, ali ne predstavljaju najveći postotak igrača mobilnih igara? Jedna početna ideja je uokviriti sanitarne priče kao mobilne "stripove", omogućujući korisnicima da se kreću kroz zanimljivu pripovijest s suptilnim sanitarnim i higijenskim porukama.<br/><br/>Kako se lekcije iz igre mogu prenijeti u ruralna područja, gdje je manje onih koji joj mogu pristupiti, a više onih koji se suočavaju s izazovima koje nastoji ublažiti? Urbani korisnici mogli bi ponijeti svoj telefon sa sobom u svoje rodno selo i podijeliti ga sa svojim prijateljima i obitelji, koji će početi igrati igru i nastaviti igrati priču igre u stvarnom životu.<br/><br/>Konačno, kako igra može mjeriti svoj utjecaj na sanitarno ponašanje? Usvajanje i angažman korisnika u ovom kontekstu je lažna mjerna vrijednost za procjenu utjecaja jer korisnici mogu igrati igru, ali njihovo ponašanje ostaje nepromijenjeno. Svako rješenje za mjerenje učinka trebalo bi kombinirati mobilnu igru s drugim digitalnim i nedigitalnim aplikacijama koje korisnicima pomažu u praćenju njihove upotrebe sanitarnih uređaja uz njihov uspjeh u igrama. Lokalni programeri mogu raditi u partnerstvu sa stručnjacima za promjene, organizacijama u zajednici i telekomunikacijskim tvrtkama kako bi testirali ove pristupe.<br/><br/>Ovo izvješće istražuje potencijal korištenja mobilnih igara za uključivanje građana u rješavanje trajnih izazova zajednice, ali želimo čuti od vas. Je li to učinkovit način za uključivanje ciljane populacije? Postoje li druge ideje o tome kako igre mogu utjecati na promjenu ponašanja? Biste li igrali ove igre |
| Sculpins, form a large family (300 species) of small northern fishes living on the bottom in both marine and fresh waters. Though primarily found in shallow waters, some species occur in depths to 1280 m. Approximately 16 species of sculpins exist from the Canadian Atlantic area. The se raven, longhorn, and shorthorn sculpin are the most popular species found in Newfoundland waters. Also known as gurnets, they are sometimes incorrectly called sea robins, grondin and gurnards, which are close relatives.<br/><br/>Sea Scallops: (Placopecten magellanicus)<br/><br/>Sea Scallops<br/><br/>They are also called giant or smooth scallops, are the most important commercial species of molluscan shellfish in Canada. They have two round shells, (with the commercial shell size ranging from 15 to 20 cm in diameter) nad are cream in color.<br/><br/>Sea scallops are found in the northwest Atlantic from the northern part of the Gulf of St. Lawrence to the coastal waters of North Carolina in the United States. In the northern part of this range, they occur in shallow water (less than 18 m) while in the southern portion, they are found in water deeper than 55 m.<br/><br/>The offshore fishery occurs on Georges Bank off the southwestern tip of Nova Scotia. Depending on the area, scallop fishing can be conducted on a year-round basis.<br/><br/>Sei Whale: (Balaenoptera borealis)<br/><br/>Too big to fit in one photo<br/><br/>14 meters; 13 tons.<br/><br/>The sei whale is often confused with the larger blue and fin whales. Its blow is similar to that of a fin whale, but lower and the sei's dorsal fin is more hooked.<br/><br/>The sei shows little of itself when surfacing, although it may poke its head out of the water, it only arches its back slightly and does not show its flukes before quietly submerging. The sei whale is all one slate gray color on top and may be lighter gray underneath.<br/><br/>Look for several blows in succession as the sei lays on the surface resting between its dives. It may be seen in groups of two to five off Newfoundland.<br/><br/>Shrimp (Pandalus borealis )<br/><br/>The little guy<br/><br/>During the 1990s, carapace length statistics of northern shrimp decreased in commercial and survey catches off Newfoundland and Labrador. Decreased growth rates caused by decreases in per-capita food availability due to large population increases, exacerbated by increased metabolic demands from higher water temperatures in the mid-1990s, appear to be the main cause of the size decrease. Fishing could have had an accelerating effect on environmentally driven decreases in shrimp growth and size by 'cropping' the largest shrimp from the population. The greatest decreases in shrimp size occurred in Hudson Strait and the adjacent northern shelf, the area which also has the highest densities and largest shrimp.<br/><br/>Silver Hake (Merluccius bilinearis)<br/><br/>Silver Hake<br/><br/>Silver Hake (Merluccius bilinearis)<br/><br/>Silver hake are members of the cod family, but are more slender and have two dorsal fins. They are dark gray with silver underparts. When freshly taken from the water, they are silvery iridescent, but the bright colour soon fades. Fish in the catch range from 20 to 30 cm in length and weigh between 0.1 and 0.3 kg.<br/><br/>Occurring from the Grand Banks to South Carolina, silver hake are mainly found on Georges Bank and on the Nova Scotia Banks, particularly on Browns Bank and the Sable Island Banks in depths of 55 to 275 m. Silver hake are generally found in the warmer waters of the Canadian Atlantic (7 to 10° C).<br/><br/>Formerly under-utilized in the Canadian fisheries and harvested mainly by fleets of other nations, silver hake were fished almost exclusively by Canadians using otter trawls in the late 1990s.<br/><br/>Silver Hake is sold in Baltimore as Lake Trout.<br/><br/>Skate (Raja senta) [smooth] (Raja radiata) [thorny]<br/><br/>An unpopular sea creature<br/><br/>The analysis of data for the St. Pierre Bank, which is to the south of Newfoundland, shows the average number of barndoor skate fell from about 0.6 million in the 1950s to fewer than 500 in the 1970s Meanwhile, smaller skate species, namely the horny skate and the smooth skate increased in biomass during the same interval. No barndoor skate have been caught on the St. Pierre Bank since the 1970s.<br/><br/>Smelt (Osmerus mordax)<br/><br/>Tiny Fish for Japan<br/><br/>Native to Newfoundland and Labrador. In the spring the sexually mature ripe smelt will leave either the sea or large lakes and travel up streams to spawn. In Newfoundland this can occur when the ice is still on many of the lakes. However, usually this occurs in March, April or May. The precise time depending on latitude and temperature, usually 8.90C is optimal.<br/><br/>It should be noted that the precise time of spawning is quite specific to the individual stream.<br/><br/>Spawning may last up to three weeks, but the peak seldom lasts more than a week. Spawning takes place at night with spawners returning to the lake or ocean by day . The length of both sexes will decrease in size as the period for spawning progresses. Two males will align themselves on either side of a ripe female. The female releases her eggs in clusters, with the milk of both males being released simultaneously. Eggs become adhesive shortly after extrusion, and attach to bottom gravel.<br/><br/>Snow Crab (Chionoecetes opilio)<br/><br/>Snow Crab<br/><br/>Snow crabs are common in the estuary and the Gulf of St. Lawrence, around Cape Breton Island and in the bays of Newfoundland, from Fortune Bay to White Bay. They are also found near Hamilton Bank off Labrador.<br/><br/>Snow crabs live most commonly on muddy or sand-mud bottoms at temperatures ranging from -0.5 to 4.5°C. In the Gulf of St. Lawrence, they are usually found at depths of 70 to 140 m, while in Cape Breton the depth varies from 45 to 245 m, and 170 to 380 m off Newfoundland. The distribution of small crabs is not well documented but they are occasionally found with the adults, or on gravelly bottoms at shallower depths. In some areas, there are indications that snow crabs move from gravel bottom to mud bottom, usually in deeper waters, as they reach maturity.<br/><br/>Sowerby's Beaked Whale (Mesopolodon bidens)<br/><br/>Where's the sexy lifeguard?<br/><br/>5 meters; 1.5 tons<br/><br/>It is also known as the north sea beaked whale, a rare whale of which little is known. It is thought to be mid-ocean whale which occasionally strays inshore feeding on squid and cod<br/><br/>The majority of whale strandings in the Western north Atlantic have occurred in Newfoundland and Labrador.<br/><br/>The Sowerby's is slate gray on the dorsal side and lighter gray on the ventral region. In adult males two teeth are often seen about one third of the way back on the beak erupted outside the mouth. The beak is around 50 cm long. One onlooker said the head looks like a thermos.<br/><br/>Sperm Whale: (Physeter catadon)<br/><br/>No jokes, please.<br/><br/>13 meters; 28 tons<br/><br/>The largest of the toothed whales is often referred to as "Moby Dick." Located at the front of its head, the single blowhole sends a slanted 5-meter misty spray out 45 degrees from its body. Its massive square head and the series of bumps that replace its dorsal fin easily identify the sperm whale It is slate gray. Sperm whales, like the humpback, will throw their tails high into the air when diving.<br/><br/>They are found offshore hunting for squid in deep water, but occasionally can be seen inshore singly or in small groups. | Sculpins, tvore veliku obitelj (300 vrsta) malih sjevernih riba koje žive na dnu iu morskim i slatkim vodama. Iako se prvenstveno nalaze u plitkim vodama, neke vrste se javljaju na dubinama do 1280 m. Otprilike 16 vrsta skulpina postoji iz kanadskog atlantskog područja. Se gavran, dugorog i kratkorog skulpin su najpopularnije vrste koje se nalaze u vodama Newfoundlanda. Također poznati kao gurneti, ponekad se pogrešno nazivaju morski robini, grondini i gurnardi, koji su bliski rođaci.<br/><br/>Morska grdobina: (Placopecten magellanicus)<br/><br/>Morski grbavci<br/><br/>Također se nazivaju divovskim ili glatkim školjkama, najvažnije su komercijalne vrste školjkaša u Kanadi. Imaju dvije okrugle školjke, (s komercijalnom veličinom školjke u rasponu od 15 do 20 cm u promjeru) nad su krem boje.<br/><br/>Morske školjke nalaze se u sjeverozapadnom Atlantiku od sjevernog dijela zaljeva St. Lawrence do obalnih voda Sjeverne Karoline u Sjedinjenim Državama. U sjevernom dijelu ovog raspona javljaju se u plitkim vodama (manje od 18 m), dok se u južnom dijelu nalaze u vodama dubljim od 55 m.<br/><br/>Offshore ribolov se odvija na Georges Banku na jugozapadnom vrhu Nove Škotske. Ovisno o području, ribolov školjki može se provoditi tijekom cijele godine.<br/><br/>Sei Whale: (Balaenoptera borealis)<br/><br/>Prevelika da stane u jednu fotografiju<br/><br/>14 metara; 13 tona.<br/><br/>Sei kit se često miješa s većim plavim i perajnim kitovima. Njegov udarac je sličan udarcu perajnog kita, ali niži i leđna peraja sei je više zakačena.<br/><br/>Sei pokazuje malo o sebi kada se pojavljuje na površini, iako može izvući glavu iz vode, samo lagano izboči leđa i ne pokazuje svoje pahuljice prije mirnog ronjenja. Sei kit je sve jedna škriljevca sive boje na vrhu i može biti svjetlija siva ispod.<br/><br/>Potražite nekoliko udaraca uzastopno dok sei leži na površini između svojih ronjenja. Može se vidjeti u skupinama od dva do pet izvan Newfoundlanda.<br/><br/>Škampi (Pandalus borealis )<br/><br/>Mali čovjek<br/><br/>Tijekom 1990-ih, statistika duljine oklopa sjevernih škampa smanjila se u komercijalnom i istraživačkom ulovu kod Newfoundlanda i Labradora. Smanjene stope rasta uzrokovane smanjenjem dostupnosti hrane po glavi stanovnika zbog velikog porasta populacije, pogoršane povećanim metaboličkim potrebama zbog viših temperatura vode sredinom 1990-ih, čini se da su glavni uzrok smanjenja veličine. Ribolov je mogao imati ubrzavajući učinak na ekološki potaknuto smanjenje rasta i veličine škampa tako što je "uzgajao" najveće škampe iz populacije. Najveće smanjenje veličine škampa dogodilo se u Hudsonovom tjesnacu i susjednom sjevernom grebenu, području koje također ima najveću gustoću i najveće škampe.<br/><br/>oslić (Merluccius bilinearis)<br/><br/>Srebrna oslića<br/><br/>oslić (Merluccius bilinearis)<br/><br/>Srebrna oslića su pripadnici obitelji bakalara, ali su vitkiji i imaju dvije leđne peraje. Tamno sive su sa srebrnim donjim dijelovima. Kad se svježe izvade iz vode, srebrnkaste su prelijeva, ali svijetla boja uskoro blijedi. Ribe u ulovu kreću se od 20 do 30 cm u dužinu i teže između 0,1 i 0,3 kg.<br/><br/>Od Grand Banksa do Južne Karoline, srebrna oslića se uglavnom nalazi na Georges Banku i na bankama Nove Škotske, osobito na Browns Banku i Sable Island Banks na dubinama od 55 do 275 metara. Srebrna oslića obično se nalazi u toplijim vodama kanadskog Atlantika (7 do 10° C).<br/><br/>Nekada nedovoljno iskorištena u kanadskom ribarstvu i ulovljena uglavnom od strane flota drugih naroda, srebro oslića su lovili gotovo isključivo Kanađani koristeći koće vidre u kasnim 1990-ima.<br/><br/>Silver Hake se prodaje u Baltimoreu kao Lake Trout.<br/><br/>Skate (Raja senta) [glatka] (Raja radiata) [trnovita]<br/><br/>Nepopularno morsko stvorenje<br/><br/>Analiza podataka za St. Pierre Bank, koja se nalazi južno od Newfoundlanda, pokazuje da je prosječni broj klizaljki pao s oko 0,6 milijuna u 1950-ima na manje od 500 u 1970-ima U međuvremenu, manje vrste klizaljki, odnosno rožnate klizaljke i glatke klizaljke, povećale su se u biomasi tijekom istog intervala. Nijedna klizaljka nije uhvaćena u St. Pierre Banku od 1970-ih.<br/><br/>Smelt (Osmerus mordax)<br/><br/>Mala riba za Japan<br/><br/>Porijeklom iz Newfoundlanda i Labradora. U proljeće će spolno zreli mirisni miris napustiti ili more ili velika jezera i putovati potocima kako bi se mrijestili. U Newfoundlandu se to može dogoditi kada je led još uvijek na mnogim jezerima. Međutim, obično se to događa u ožujku, travnju ili svibnju. Točno vrijeme ovisno o zemljopisnoj širini i temperaturi, obično 8.90C je optimalno.<br/><br/>Treba napomenuti da je točno vrijeme mrijesta vrlo specifično za pojedini tok.<br/><br/>Mrijest može trajati i do tri tjedna, ali vrhunac rijetko traje više od tjedan dana. Mrijest se odvija noću s mrijestiteljima koji se danju vraćaju u jezero ili ocean . Duljina oba spola smanjit će se u veličini kako razdoblje za mrijest napreduje. Dva mužjaka će se poravnati s obje strane zrele ženke. Ženka oslobađa jaja u grozdovima, a mlijeko oba mužjaka se oslobađa istodobno. Jaja postaju ljepljiva ubrzo nakon ekstruzije i pričvršćuju se na donji šljunak.<br/><br/>Snježni rak (Chionoecetes opilio)<br/><br/>Snježni rak<br/><br/>Snježni rakovi su uobičajeni u estuariju i zaljevu St. Lawrence, oko otoka Cape Breton i u uvalama Newfoundlanda, od Fortune Baya do White Baya. Također se nalaze u blizini Hamilton Bank off Labrador.<br/><br/>Snježni rakovi najčešće žive na blatnjavim ili pješčanim blatnjavim dnima na temperaturama u rasponu od -0,5 do 4,5°C. U zaljevu St. Lawrence obično se nalaze na dubinama od 70 do 140 m, dok u Cape Bretonu dubina varira od 45 do 245 m, a 170 do 380 m od Newfoundlanda. Raspodjela malih rakova nije dobro dokumentirana, ali se povremeno nalaze kod odraslih, ili na šljunčanim dnima na plitkim dubinama. U nekim područjima postoje naznake da se snježni rakovi kreću od šljunčanog dna do blatnog dna, obično u dubljim vodama, kako dostižu zrelost.<br/><br/>Sowerby's Beaked Whale (Mezopolodon bidens)<br/><br/>Gdje je seksi spasilac?<br/><br/>5 metara; 1,5 tona<br/><br/>Poznat je i kao kit sa sjevernim morskim kljunom, rijetki kit o kojem se malo zna. Smatra se da je kit srednjeg oceana koji povremeno luta obalom hraneći se lignjama i bakalarima<br/><br/>Većina iskrcaja kitova u zapadnom sjevernom Atlantiku dogodila se u Newfoundlandu i Labradoru.<br/><br/>Sowerby's je škriljevca siva na leđnoj strani i svijetlije siva na trbušnoj regiji. Kod odraslih mužjaka često se vide dva zuba oko jedne trećine puta natrag na kljun koji je izbio izvan usta. Kljun je dug oko 50 cm. Jedan promatrač je rekao da glava izgleda kao termos.<br/><br/>Sperma kita: (Physeter katadon)<br/><br/>Bez šala, molim vas.<br/><br/>13 metara; 28 tona<br/><br/>Najveći od zubastih kitova često se naziva "Moby Dick". Smješten na prednjoj strani glave, jedan otvor za puhanje šalje koso 5 metara maglovito prskanje 45 stupnjeva od svog tijela. Njegova masivna kvadratna glava i niz kvrga koje zamjenjuju leđnu peraju lako identificiraju kita spermija. Sperma kitovi, poput grbavca, bacaju repove visoko u zrak prilikom ronjenja.<br/><br/>Nalaze se u dubokomorskom lovu na lignje, ali se povremeno mogu vidjeti na obali pojedinačno ili u malim skupinama. |
