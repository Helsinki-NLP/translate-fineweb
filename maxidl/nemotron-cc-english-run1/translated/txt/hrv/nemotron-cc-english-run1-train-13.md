| Sleep Clinic<br/><br/>The sleep disorders program evaluates and treats children and adults affected by sleep-related problems such as insomnia, sleep apnea, narcolepsy and other hypersomnias, parasomnias and night time enuresis. The residents see patients during sleep disorders clinic hours.<br/><br/>During this rotation, the residents are exposed to a wide variety of sleep disorders. They are trained to investigate and evaluate their own patient care experiences pertaining to sleep evaluations with appraisal and assimilation of current scientific evidence. The residents work closely with sleep disorder faculty physicians and acquire the skills to formulate and communicate with patients and families about their diagnostic assessment and management plan, including neuropharmacology. Providing care plans to other physicians and care providers either verbally or via letter/note is an integral part of the program. | Sleep Clinic<br/><br/>Program poremećaja spavanja procjenjuje i liječi djecu i odrasle koji pate od problema povezanih sa spavanjem kao što su nesanica, apneja za vrijeme spavanja, narkolepsija i druge hipersomnije, parasomnije i noćna enureza.

| Truly Handsfree Bluetooth Headset Takes Voice Commands<br/><br/>Most Bluetooth headsets are perfectly capable of the voice dial thing, assuming that the connected mobile phone can do it, but the BlueAnt V1 takes voice control to a new high. The incredibly compact Bluetooth headset is being marketed as the first ever with a true voice-based user interface.<br/><br/>Instead of clicking a physical button to answer your calls, you simply speak into the microphone and say "accept call". Other basic voice commands could include "volume up", "reject call", or "do the laundry". Okay, maybe it won't do that last thing, but you can see how a completely handsfree experience like that offered by the BlueAnt V1 can be excellent for drivers and other people who need their hands. That is why you're using a Bluetooth headset in the first place.<br/><br/>The downside is that the voice control can be "wonky" and it can be quite frustrating when you accidentally give it a command that you don't want it to do. What happens if you're in a call with someone and you happens to say "end call"? | Uistinu Handsfree Bluetooth slušalice uzima glasovne naredbe<br/><br/>Većina Bluetooth slušalica savršeno je sposobna za glasovno biranje, pod pretpostavkom da povezani mobilni telefon to može, ali BlueAnt V1 uzima glasovnu kontrolu na novu visinu. Nevjerojatno kompaktne Bluetooth slušalice prodaju se kao prve u povijesti s pravim glasovnim korisničkim sučeljem.<br/><br/>Umjesto da kliknete na fizički gumb za odgovor na vaše pozive, jednostavno govorite u mikrofon i kažete "prihvati poziv". Ostale osnovne glasovne naredbe mogu uključivati "glasnoća", "odbijanje poziva" ili "pranje rublja". Ok, možda to neće učiniti posljednju stvar, ali možete vidjeti kako potpuno handsfree iskustvo poput onog koje nudi BlueAnt V1 može biti izvrsno za vozače i druge ljude koji trebaju svoje ruke. To je razlog zašto koristite Bluetooth slušalice na prvom mjestu.<br/><br/>Nedostatak je da glasovna kontrola može biti "wonky" i može biti prilično frustrirajuće kada slučajno date naredbu da to ne želite učiniti. Što se događa ako ste u pozivu s nekim i slučajno kažete "kraj poziva"? |
| Wednesday, July 06, 2005<br/><br/>Going to college? DREAM on<br/><br/>Here is another great article about our failing (and increasingly ridiculous) immigration system, this time from the Boston Globe. A 18-year undocumented immigrant from Massachusetts was awarded a four-year scholarship at any state university because of her high test scores, but this was later rescinded once state officials found out about her immigration status. As the author of the article so rightly says,<br/><br/>"So much for celebrating the building blocks for success and the American dream. Romney says, tough luck if you are smart, hardworking, and the child of illegal immigrants."<br/><br/>It's beyond me why anyone wants to keep smart, high-achieving kids like this one out of college. Does anybody really think that denying in-state tuition and scholarships to undocumented immigrants will make any potential immigrants think twice about coming here to work? Or are policies like these motivated by fear? Despite the increasingly widespread movement in favor of the DREAM Act and state laws (see this previous post) to allow undocumented students to pay in-state tuition, it seems like the power of fear is growing.<br/><br/>It's interesting that Mass. Gov. Romney is bashing undocumented immigrants now - this article in the Economist shows how his campaign to end gay marriage in Massachusetts is closely linked to his anticipated run for the presidency in 2008. Here in New York, presumed Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton has gone to the right on immigration, claiming that she is "adamantly against illegal immigrants." It's unfortunate that the way to get ahead in politics (particularly in the red states) is to blame immigrants for our problems. It will be interesting to see if an increased Latino turnout in places like the Southwest will prove Hillary wrong.<br/><br/>3 comments:<br/><br/>Maybe people do not want illegal aliens to get scholarhips for the following reasons:<br/><br/>1. Their parents violated the law to enter the country. 2. Their parents had to steal someone's identity to work in this country. 3. Their parents have to cheat on their income taxes (and other taxes) to stay here. 4. Their parents had to lie to get their children admitted. 5. their parents lied on applications for things like free lunch.<br/><br/>First, the Supreme Court ruled in 1982 that all children have the right to public education regardless of immigration status. Schools are prohibited from asking about a child's immigration status, meaning that undocumented parents do not have to "lie" to get their kids free lunch.<br/><br/>Second, many immigrants do not have to use another identity or cheat on income taxes in order to work here -- many employers knowingly hire undocumented immigrants (this has been happening for some time - the 1986 Imm. Reform and Control Act's attempted to deal with it, and many anti-immigrant advocates argue that employer sanctions need to be strengthened today) and quite a few immigrants pay income taxes and other taxes that they never end up receiving the benefits of (the New York Times reported that illegal immigrants provide social security with a subsidy of $7 billion a year).<br/><br/>Finally, if the biggest problem with undocumented immigrants is that they are breaking the law by being here, should that same standard be applied to businesses that knowingly hire them (which, by the way, is also against the law even though it is rarely enforced)? Should the kids of these businesspeople be denied the same opportunities because their parents broke the law? Could we extend this argument to the children of everyone who has ever broken the law in this country?<br/><br/>Whatever you think about illegal immigration, the point is that the kids should not be punished for their parents' decisions to come here. Especially when these bright and hardworking undocumented students have the potential to contribute so much to our society. | srijeda, 6. srpnja 2005.<br/><br/>Ideš na koledž? SAN na<br/><br/>Evo još jednog sjajnog članka o našem neuspješnom (i sve smiješnijem) imigracijskom sustavu, ovaj put iz Bostonskog globusa. 18-godišnja imigrantica iz Massachusettsa dobila je četverogodišnju stipendiju na bilo kojem državnom sveučilištu zbog svojih visokih rezultata na testovima, ali to je kasnije ukinuto nakon što su državni dužnosnici saznali za njezin imigracijski status. Kao što autor članka s pravom kaže,<br/><br/>"Toliko o slavljenju građevnih blokova za uspjeh i američki san. Romney kaže, teška sreća ako ste pametni, marljivi i dijete ilegalnih imigranata."<br/><br/>To je izvan mene zašto svatko želi zadržati pametan, visoko postignuća djeca kao što je ovaj jedan izvan koledža. Da li itko stvarno misli da će uskraćivanje školarine i stipendije nedokumentiranim imigrantima natjerati potencijalne imigrante da dvaput razmisle o dolasku ovdje na posao? Ili su takve politike motivirane strahom? Unatoč sve raširenijem pokretu u korist Zakona o snu i državnih zakona (vidi ovaj prethodni post) kako bi se nedokumentiranim studentima omogućilo plaćanje školarine u državi, čini se da moć straha raste.<br/><br/>Zanimljivo je da guverner Romney sada tuče nedokumentirane imigrante - ovaj članak u Economistu pokazuje kako je njegova kampanja za okončanje istospolnih brakova u Massachusettsu usko povezana s njegovom očekivanom kandidaturom za predsjednika 2008. godine. Ovdje u New Yorku, pretpostavljena demokratska predvodnica Hillary Clinton otišla je desno na imigraciju, tvrdeći da je "adamantno protiv ilegalnih imigranata". Nažalost, način da se napreduje u politici (osobito u crvenim državama) je okriviti imigrante za naše probleme. Bit će zanimljivo vidjeti hoće li povećana latino izlaznost u mjestima poput Jugozapada dokazati da Hillary nije u pravu.<br/><br/>3 komentara:<br/><br/>Možda ljudi ne žele da ilegalni vanzemaljci dobiju stipendije iz sljedećih razloga:<br/><br/>1. Njihovi roditelji su prekršili zakon kako bi ušli u zemlju. 2. Njihovi roditelji su morali ukrasti nečiji identitet kako bi radili u ovoj zemlji. 3. Njihovi roditelji moraju varati na porezima na dohodak (i drugim porezima) kako bi ostali ovdje. 4. Njihovi roditelji su morali lagati kako bi primili djecu. 5. njihovi roditelji su lagali o zahtjevima za stvari poput besplatnog ručka.<br/><br/>Prvo, Vrhovni sud je 1982. presudio da sva djeca imaju pravo na javno obrazovanje bez obzira na imigracijski status. Školama je zabranjeno postavljati pitanja o imigracijskom statusu djeteta, što znači da roditelji bez dokumenata ne moraju "lagati" kako bi svojoj djeci osigurali besplatan ručak.<br/><br/>Drugo, mnogi imigranti ne moraju koristiti drugi identitet ili varati na porezu na dohodak kako bi radili ovdje -- mnogi poslodavci svjesno zapošljavaju nedokumentirane imigrante (to se događa već neko vrijeme - 1986 Imm. Zakon o reformi i kontroli pokušao se nositi s tim, a mnogi anti-imigrantski zagovornici tvrde da sankcije poslodavca treba ojačati danas) i prilično malo imigranata plaćaju porez na dohodak i druge poreze koji nikada ne završe primajući koristi od (New York Times izvijestio da ilegalni imigranti pružaju socijalnu sigurnost s subvencijom od 7 milijardi dolara godišnje).<br/><br/>Konačno, ako je najveći problem s nedokumentiranim useljenicima to što krše zakon time što su ovdje, treba li isti standard primijeniti i na poduzeća koja ih svjesno zapošljavaju (što je, usput rečeno, također protivno zakonu iako se rijetko provodi)? Treba li djeci tih poslovnih ljudi uskratiti iste mogućnosti jer su njihovi roditelji prekršili zakon? Možemo li proširiti ovaj argument na djecu svakoga tko je ikada prekršio zakon u ovoj zemlji?<br/><br/>Što god mislite o ilegalnoj imigraciji, poanta je da djeca ne bi trebala biti kažnjena za odluke svojih roditelja da dođu ovdje. Pogotovo kada ti pametni i marljivi studenti bez dokumenata imaju potencijal toliko doprinijeti našem društvu. |

| ΑΛΗΘΩΣ<br/><br/>Corporations are not people and money is not speech<br/><br/>In Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned century-old restrictions on corporate spending in elections under the guise of protecting First Amendment free speech rights. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, writing for the majority, said, "If the First Amendment has any force, it prohibits Congress from fining or jailing citizens, or associations of citizens, for simply engaging in political speech." This argument of the majority decision rests on the notions that corporations are covered by the same free speech protections as individual citizens and that campaign donations or financing are the same as speech.<br/><br/>Corporations, however, are inherently not the same as individuals and thus cannot have the same protections as individuals. There are a slew of laws that protect corporations and their interests in the arena for which they are by definition formed—namely the marketplace. The laws that govern corporations and the rights enjoyed by them are distinct from the laws and rights of individuals. A corporation, for example, can enter into contracts like an individual, but unlike an individual, a corporation's members can be protected by limited liability so their personal assets are not at stake.<br/><br/>If a corporation, then, is a distinct legal entity governed by different laws than an individual is, corporations are not protected under the First Amendment in the same way that individuals are protected. Corporations, especially in their most powerful and wealthy incarnations, are exponentially more influential than most individuals in America. The restrictions on corporate spending in elections that were overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court were meant to redress this power balance between average individuals and unduly influential businesses. Corporations already have a plethora of ways to influence politics, from political action committees to lobbyists on Capitol Hill. The framers of the Bill of Rights wanted to protect the voices of the trampled, not amplify the voices of the elite.<br/><br/>The other part of the Supreme Court's premise for its decision is that the First Amendment free speech clause applies to campaign funding. While speech can be interpreted loosely as any form of expression, such an open, ambiguous definition would create a myriad of problems with all kinds of laws. An architect has a vision of a building: it is his art, his self expression, yet he cannot ignore local zoning laws that, for instance, restrict the height of his building. Should he sue the state for violation of his free speech, his right to expression? Equating money with speech also opens the door to sundry ludicrous claims by, for instance, an employer who objects to minimum wage laws since he'd like to express that his employees are only worth paying $3 an hour. There have to be restrictions on what constitutes speech to prevent a bastardization of the term and an overly liberal interpretation of the First Amendment.<br/><br/>A corporation already has the power to issue a statement in favor of a candidate or policy through its political action committees, and individual members of a business are welcome to contribute money as well. However, allowing a corporation to use its vast profits to directly finance the election or to remove a candidate compromises the democratic notion of a free and fair election. There are unseemly ties even now between politicians and various industries, but this new ruling would make such connections more robust and give them a veneer of legitimacy. A politician financed by a business would become completely beholden to its political agenda and not to the voters.<br/><br/>It's not only the independence of politicians that's at stake, but also the independence of our judges, who are at the very least expected to be impartial. Many states still use elections to appoint judges, which leaves them vulnerable to the influence of political spending. In a recent speech at a law school conference, former Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor worried about the impact of corporate campaign funding in judicial elections, saying that "judicial campaigning makes last week's decision in Citizens United an increasing problem for maintaining an independent judiciary."<br/><br/>Two cornerstones of our democracy—free elections and an independent judiciary—are threatened by the Supreme Court's activist and meddling decision. The case could have been decided much more narrowly in favor of Citizens United, but instead, the majority of the justices decided to expand the case to champion the rights of big money over the interest of the American people. Senators Dick Durbin (D-IL) and Arlen Specter (D-PA) introduced the Fair Elections Now Act last March. It would prohibit contributions from political action committees and would match individual donations, limited to $100, on a 4:1 basis so that fundraising focuses on the people. Such a system has been in place in New York City since the 1988 Campaign Finance Act. The rest of the country is long overdue to follow. Never before has the fight for public financing been more necessary.<br/><br/>The author is a Columbia College junior majoring in political science. She is a prospective law student.<br/><br/>The 14th amendment, which was one of the Reconstruction amendments added following the War of Northern Aggression was never legally ratified by the States and has caused more problems than all the other post-war amendments combined. If my memory serves me right, corporations were declared by the Supreme Court to be 14th Amemdment citizens during the late 1800s or early 1900s. In case you are unfamiliar with the wording of this amendment, it basically made everyone a citizen (and subject) of the United States. Prior to the War, all individuals were citizens of the State within which they resided and no one was a citizen of the United States nor were they subject to the jurisdiction of the United States except for those who resided in the District of Columbia or resided within one of the territories under the jurisdiction of the United States. The main purposes of the War of Northern Aggression was to destroy the soverienty of the individual States and reduce the status of every American to that of a subject under the control and jurisdiction of the United States government. The founding fathers set up our government as a loose confederation of Sovereign States with the States exercising all meaningful polical power. They never invisioned or intended any effective political power to reside in Washington. Things will only get much worse until We the People throw the theives and money changers out of Washington and restore our government back to what it once was.<br/><br/>The word person means corporation in law. It is not that corporations are not people, it is that people are not corporations. We have been tricked into accepting a corporate identity[ALL CAPS]. Look at your drivers license. Every time we go to court,we go as a corporation, not as a natural person.The first corporations were governments. Looked at logically, limited liability for a corporation is the extension of sovereign immunity to the king after he was no longer king. The same ruling elite families are still in control and that goes all the way back to the first known about extraterrestrials[anunaki] that the Sumerian documents talk about.The same group also take the credit or blame for all the religions and secret societies.<br/><br/>What difference does it make? Really. Think about it, the whole entire Congress and Senate are a dog and pony show, the real power brokers who control it all are in the shadows, working the deals, doing what they want, with the AL-CIA-DA and MOSSAD out there killing everyone who disagrees with these shadow government assholes who truly run it all.<br/><br/>So, why is it so important now to be so upset over this shit? Why now? After more than two hundred years of absolute proof that the politicians are just a fancy hand puppet show to distract us from the REAL WHEELING AND DEALING IN THE BACK ROOMS elsewhere, why does it matter now that the total contempt of democracy is being demonstrated by SCOTUS in this ruling? The assholes on this court know that the real guys with their hands on the power levers of the system aren't in the Congress and the Senate.<br/><br/>When the Rule of Law became OBSOLETE in the world, in general, and everything became more or less ROLLERBALL only this time, on STEROIDS, for and by the CORPORATIONS, why did this sole ruling make all that much difference? Why do all of you assholes think that this 'lagging' indicator of the end of any semblances of democratic government makes any difference.<br/><br/>Hypothetically, let's say this ruling had not happened. Do any of you think that the corporations and the moneyed influences in the shadows wouldn't have continued to exert any and all of their will on the rest of us?<br/><br/>For those of you who think it'd been different, I suggest you find a remedy to your TOTAL NAIVETE!!!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>this ruling didn't make one iota of a difference. It was always like this, long before SCOTUS basically said to corporations; "go ahead, do what the fuck you want…the little people are just cannon fodder for your wars, chattel for you to barter and sell at your leisure.."<br/><br/>democracy was always an illusion. We never ever had any control, ever. making such a mountain out of this mole hill is absolutely unwarranted, in light of the fact that for the whole entire 230 year history of this republic, the fat cats and the rich oligarchs never needed any Congress or Senate to do what they pleased, under any circumstances, ever. They just did it.<br/><br/>The government you were looking at was a chimera, not real..<br/><br/>the sooner you all come to that realization, the sooner we can get on with less pissing and moaning over a mere joke of a technicality that was always the case from day one, and was not foisted on us by the SCOTUS, the court only quite belatedly declared to us what has been happening for a long long long, corrupt time.<br/><br/>I've got a mad crush on Exxon, and Exxon has one on me, wedding bells in the spring – a bit quick I know, but our love can't be denied. Exxon is a little shy, so don't expect any public announcements, we're thinking a quiet wedding in Reno.<br/><br/>Any business is simply a group of individuals (small or large) exercising their individual rights collectively. Therefore, any business has the same rights as those individuals (except, of course, the right to vote, which is reserved to the individuals themselves). The freedom to dispose of one's wealth as one sees fit comes along with the freedom to earn it. If an aggregate of individuals has earned money, it should be free to decide how do dispose of that money. The real problem is not that businesses can donate to campaigns, it is that the government has been allowed to meddle in business – i.e. that the government can grant some favor in return for that money. We need separation of commerce and state in the same way and for the same reasons as we have separation of church and state. I also find it interesting that the author chose as examples two laws (zoning and minimum wage) that also violate individual rights. The first violates property rights and the second violates the rights of individuals to contract freely.<br/><br/>under your jackoffian analysis, nobody should interfere with anything anyone does at all. say, if I were in a crowd, with a saturday night special, and I want to 'free speech' your butt with it much in the same way the CIA free speeched Bobby Kennedy in L.A. one night, that's fine, because to interfere with me is interfering with my right to free speech you.<br/><br/>that's the critical flaw with you libertarian assholes….you think that there is no societal role for any rule of law, that anything that fits under 'ends justify means' rationale shouldn't ever be interfered with, just let everyone do whatever they so choose, and it all works out. That Ayn Rand bullshit doesn't work, dude! It works right up to the point where someone else pays a price for your 'whatever i wanna do' freedom crosses a line and then interfere with my freedom.<br/><br/>rules and laws SHOULD exist in the framework of society strictly to keep in check that good old "I can do anything I want to and it's just me being free" line of horse shit.<br/><br/>Corporations do not have any rights, dorkus! globally, they have been the reason why there are so many failed states, pillaged by the will of corporatocrats based in the U.S.S.A. who think that freedom of their speech translates into; "do what we tell you or we'll bomb you to get your resources we need" kind of raping and pillaging.<br/><br/>someday, I hope some asshole fucks you with their 'free speech' and then we'll hear your sorry ass whine about how the law let you down. What law? In your libertarian world of 'I can do what I want', the only rule of law is the one you make up to justify your end goal. For you then, it'll be fun to see how you cope with some other asshole's interpretation of your boundary being just a little bit of a mere inconvenience for his goals, which didn't necessarily respect your boundaries at all, for damned sure!<br/><br/>Someone by the name of "uh huh, right.." might have a logical point hidden in the forest of name-calling and straw-man abuse, but how about this: Corporations are inventions of the State that are created to pass some of the risks of doing business from the people running the business over to the stockholders (if any), the customers (if any) and the public. So if a corporation commits a fraud, it is the corporation that's punished (usually) and fined and the people who run the corporation get to walk away with a golden handshake. And the cost of the fine is passed along to the customers and paid to the government (not the victims!). To "David"s point, if we were to separate government and commerce, corporations would cease to exist! Not a bad idea.<br/><br/>I think that the point is, that if a corporation commits a financial crime, and nobody notices (the if the tree falls in the forest and nobody hears it, did it truly make a noise argument) then did a crime actually take place?<br/><br/>and in a veitch diagram, where the two blobs collide and interact, if one encroaches on the other one's boundary, who is the arbiter of who got violated?<br/><br/>my point is this: there are no straw man arguments with regard to david's asinine assessment that corporations can do whatever they want with abandon. the truth of the matter is, granting corporations, and oligarchs, or whomever, a license to do what they want, whenever they want, under the premise that THEY ARE INDIVIDUALS and hence, guaranteed FREE SPEECH, is both absurd and horse shit.<br/><br/>corporations are made up of groups of people. people who should live by some semblance of Rule of Law. When they don't have to, then it's "I can do anything I want as long as nobody catches me or holds me accountable for my transgressions" going on here.<br/><br/>if that's the world David wants to live in, let him go there and make it happen, but goddamn it, don't expect me not to fucking object to that shit!<br/><br/>We can all get along, just as long as boundaries are not gratuitously violated at will by anyone who thinks their right to do what they want actually nullifies my right not to be interfered with by their actions.<br/><br/>with regard to corporations, they have no right to violate my rights, or yours, or anyone elses. If they can't function in the community as a benevolent and hence, non interfering entity, then they have no right to exist.<br/><br/>and David wasn't being threatened. he's an asshole for asserting that "do what you want, it's freedom of speech" is a bunch of horse shit. It's la la land bullshit. And I object to anyone or anything violating my boundaries with that free speech assertion. That's a crock of shit and you know it is!<br/><br/>Well, that was a colorful response. Sadly, "uh-uh", you are way off the mark. I never said people have the right to infringe on anyone else's rights…and I repudiate "ends justify the means" thinking. Yes, laws SHOULD exist, but ONLY to PROTECT the rights of people. I'm sorry you have such a warped and horribly incorrect view of my argument.<br/><br/>your point well taken, David. I apologize for peeing in your corn flakes. I think I thought you were inferring that corporations were able to do whatever they pleased under this right of FREEDOM OF SPEECH, which in Amerk'a is a joke today because the PATRIOT ACT and a non-declared state of MARTIAL LAW we've been living under since Sept. 2001, has given the government the ability to suspend and or 'shred' the U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights.<br/><br/>sadly, people have only a few rights. we have the right to be taxed to the point of absurdity. we have the right to be conscripted and become cannon fodder for oligarch wars. and we have the right to shut the fuck up and be quiet while we are being joy boinked by corporations and oligarchs and bankers. those are our rights, and sadly, they truly SUCKETH, David. I think we can agree on that!<br/><br/>I'm still wondering how the newbie, Roberts, inherited the Chief Justiceship after Rhenquist rather than that role going to someone with more experience on the bench. What does "The Roberts Court" plan to do next, though, for corporations? Give them the right to vote at the polls like real people?; perhaps have votes by human beings counted as 3/5 of a person or less to their 1?<br/><br/>I haven't read all of the 183-page booklength "ruling" yet but find these appalling statements therein to be not only contradictory to their expansive actions in this case but also something of an abdication of their duty:<br/><br/>"the gravest and most delicate duty that this Court is called upon to perform." Blodgett v. Holden, 275 U. S. 142, 147–148 (1927) (Holmes, J., concurring). Because the stakes are so high, our standard practice is to refrain from addressing constitutional questions except when necessary to rule on particular claims before us. See Ashwander v. TVA, 297 U. S. 288, 346–348 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concur-ring). This policy underlies both our willingness to construe ambiguous statutes to avoid constitutional problems and our practice "'never to formulate a rule of constitutional law broader than is required by the precise facts to which it is to be applied.'" United States v. Raines, 362<br/>U. S. 17, 21 (1960) (quoting Liverpool, New York & Philadelphia S. S. Co. v. Commissioners of Emigration, 113<br/>U. S. 33, 39 (1885)).<br/>The majority and dissent are united in expressing allegiance to these principles. Ante, at 12; post, at 14 (STEVENS, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). >><br/><br/>Roberts, by virtue of his lies during CONfirmation by the DEMS who shoved his lying ass thru the process at mach speed, needs to be 'impeached' for being a fucking liar. He specifically stated he would not go this route of writing decisions not based on settled, non controversial concepts of the U.S. Constitution…and here clearly he has done exactly the opposite of that.<br/><br/>The real blame should be on the shoulders of the cocksuckers in the SENATE that confirmed the son of a bitch in the first place, stating they wouldn't vote against his confirmation because they were saving their ammo for REAL THREATS TO US..<br/><br/>I blame the fucking DINOCRATS more than I blame this lying pile of shit named Roberts. Pricks like SCHUMER and that other asshole from Illinois, and that lying zionist bastard Levin from Michigan. Just a couple of them holding their ground could have stopped the confirmation of Alito, and then Roberts. But they let it slide.<br/><br/>the assertion that all of this is indeed window dressing is a correct one, and the truth is, though blatantly a violation of our rights across the board, these scum in the SCOTUS are only post fact, asserting the screwing they were doing to us for a long, long, long time.<br/><br/>the truth is, it never mattered what we thought was going on, because Corporations have been functioning well outside the law for a long time now, and nobody has held them accountable. the very bastards that sit on the SCOTUS are benefactors of the wrongdoing and greed of the corporations who provide kickbacks to them for their decisions, in the form of STOCK DIVIDENDS.<br/><br/>unfortunately, focusing on the corrupt SCOTUS doesn't help us much. It's like stating the obvious, and expecting it to be punishable, when it is not.<br/><br/>we are fucked no matter how we look at it, but there will be a day of atonement.

Cf. 2 U. S. C. §441e (contribution and expenditure ban applied to "foreign national[s]"). Section 441b is not limited to corporations or associations that were created in foreign countries or funded predominantly by foreign shareholders. Section 441b therefore would be overbroad even if we assumed, arguendo, that the Government has a compelling interest in limiting foreign influence over our political process.

It is now in a yearly bankruptcy rollover. The government is now private like BLACKWATER. All government agencies are listed on DUNN AND BRADSTREET. The common law which the constitution specifies pertains to natural people. All business by the courts today is corporate meaning that we are viewed as individual corporations. We exist by contract with the state. Remember the 14th amendment. There were no US citizens before that. Most of us have unwittingly claimed US corporate citizenship. We need to address the rule by the banking elite.Almost all leading REPS and DEMS are members of the COUNCIL OF FOREIGN RELATIONS or the TLC. LOok up the history of who started and controls these. Rush, Glenn and Sean are all liars and banker bootlickers. Obama is a puppet for the CFR. 911 truth has a great deal more bearing and would serve to unite the honest people in this country.<br/><br/>I don't really believe I'm a corporation or the citizen of one but, if the gubbermint thinks so, does the SCOTUS ruling mean that there are no more campaign contribution limits on anyone, businesses or individuals? I'd rather see money removed from our electoral process altogether — equal time on America's airwaves given at no charge for all candidates | ΑΛΗΘΩΣ<br/><br/>Korporacije nisu ljudi, a novac nije govor<br/><br/>U predmetu Citizens United protiv Federalnog izbornog povjerenstva, Vrhovni sud SAD-a poništio je stoljetna ograničenja korporativne potrošnje na izborima pod krinkom zaštite prava na slobodu govora iz Prvog amandmana. Sudac Anthony M. Kennedy, koji je pisao za većinu, izjavio je: "Ako Prvi amandman ima bilo kakvu snagu, on zabranjuje Kongresu da kazni ili zatvori građane ili udruge građana, samo za sudjelovanje u političkom govoru." Ovaj argument odluke većine počiva na pretpostavci da su korporacije obuhvaćene istom zaštitom slobode govora kao i pojedini građani te da su donacije za kampanju ili financiranje iste kao i govor.<br/><br/>Korporacije, međutim, inherentno nisu iste kao pojedinci i stoga ne mogu imati istu zaštitu kao pojedinci. Postoji niz zakona koji štite korporacije i njihove interese u areni za koju su po definiciji formirani – naime na tržištu. Zakoni koji uređuju korporacije i prava koja uživaju razlikuju se od zakona i prava pojedinaca. Korporacija, na primjer, može sklapati ugovore kao pojedinac, ali za razliku od pojedinca, članovi korporacije mogu biti zaštićeni ograničenom odgovornošću tako da njihova osobna imovina nije u pitanju.<br/><br/>Ako je, dakle, korporacija zasebna pravna osoba koja je uređena različitim zakonima od pojedinca, korporacije nisu zaštićene Prvim amandmanom na isti način na koji su zaštićeni pojedinci. Korporacije, posebno u svojim najmoćnijim i najbogatijim inkarnacijama, eksponencijalno su utjecajnije od većine pojedinaca u Americi. Ograničenja korporativne potrošnje na izborima koja je poništio Vrhovni sud SAD-a trebala su popraviti tu ravnotežu moći između prosječnih pojedinaca i neopravdano utjecajnih poduzeća. Korporacije već imaju mnoštvo načina da utječu na politiku, od odbora za političku akciju do lobista na Capitol Hillu. Tvorci Povelje o pravima željeli su zaštititi glasove izgaženih, a ne pojačati glasove elite.<br/><br/>Drugi dio premise Vrhovnog suda za svoju odluku je da se klauzula o slobodi govora prvog amandmana primjenjuje na financiranje kampanje. Dok se govor može tumačiti labavo kao bilo koji oblik izražavanja, takva otvorena, dvosmislena definicija stvorila bi bezbroj problema sa svim vrstama zakona. Arhitekt ima viziju zgrade: to je njegova umjetnost, njegovo samoizražavanje, ali on ne može zanemariti lokalne zakone o zoniranju koji, na primjer, ograničavaju visinu njegove zgrade. Treba li tužiti državu zbog kršenja njegova slobode govora, njegova prava na izražavanje? Izjednačavanje novca s govorom također otvara vrata raznim smiješnim tvrdnjama poslodavca koji se protivi zakonima o minimalnoj plaći jer želi izraziti da njegovi zaposlenici vrijede samo 3 dolara na sat. Moraju postojati ograničenja na ono što čini govor kako bi se spriječilo bastardizacija termina i pretjerano liberalno tumačenje Prvog amandmana.<br/><br/>Korporacija već ima ovlasti izdati izjavu u korist kandidata ili politike putem svojih političkih akcijskih odbora, a pojedini članovi tvrtke također su dobrodošli da doprinesu novcem. Međutim, dopuštanje korporaciji da koristi svoju ogromnu dobit za izravno financiranje izbora ili uklanjanje kandidata kompromitira demokratski koncept slobodnih i poštenih izbora. Čak i sada postoje neprimjerene veze između političara i raznih industrija, ali ova nova presuda bi takve veze učinila snažnijima i dala im furnir legitimiteta. Političar koji se financira od strane poduzeća bio bi u potpunosti obvezan na svoju političku agendu, a ne na glasače.<br/><br/>Ne radi se samo o neovisnosti političara, već i o neovisnosti naših sudaca, od kojih se barem očekuje da budu nepristrani. Mnoge države i dalje koriste izbore za imenovanje sudaca, što ih čini ranjivima na utjecaj političke potrošnje. Bivša sutkinja Vrhovnog suda Sandra Day O'Connor izrazila je zabrinutost zbog utjecaja financiranja korporativnih kampanja na pravosudne izbore, rekavši da "pravosudna kampanja čini prošlotjednu odluku u Citizens Unitedu sve većim problemom za održavanje neovisnog pravosuđa".<br/><br/>Dva temelja naše demokracije – slobodni izbori i neovisno pravosuđe – ugroženi su aktivističkom odlukom Vrhovnog suda. Slučaj je mogao biti odlučen mnogo uže u korist Citizens Uniteda, ali umjesto toga, većina sudaca odlučila je proširiti slučaj kako bi se zalagala za prava velikog novca iznad interesa američkog naroda. Senatori Dick Durbin (D-IL) i Arlen Specter (D-PA) predstavili su Zakon o poštenim izborima u ožujku prošle godine. Njime bi se zabranili doprinosi političkih akcijskih odbora i odgovarale bi pojedinačne donacije, ograničene na 100 dolara, na osnovi 4: 1, tako da se prikupljanje sredstava usredotočuje na ljude. Takav sustav je na snazi u New Yorku od 1988 Zakona o financiranju kampanje. Ostatak zemlje je davno trebao slijediti. Nikada prije borba za javno financiranje nije bila potrebnija.<br/><br/>Autorica je studentica političke znanosti na Columbia Collegeu, budući student prava.<br/><br/>Četrnaesti amandman, koji je bio jedan od amandmana na rekonstrukciju dodanih nakon rata sjeverne agresije, nikada nije bio pravno ratificiran od strane država i izazvao je više problema od svih ostalih poslijeratnih amandmana zajedno. Ako se dobro sjećam, Vrhovni sud je proglasio korporacije 14. amandmanom tijekom kasnih 1800-ih ili ranih 1900-ih. U slučaju da niste upoznati s tekstom ovog amandmana, u osnovi je svatko postao građanin (i podanik) Sjedinjenih Država. Prije rata, svi pojedinci bili su državljani države u kojoj su boravili i nitko nije bio državljanin Sjedinjenih Država niti su bili pod jurisdikcijom Sjedinjenih Država, osim onih koji su boravili u Distriktu Columbia ili koji su boravili na jednom od područja pod jurisdikcijom Sjedinjenih Država. Glavna svrha rata sjeverne agresije bila je uništiti suverenitet pojedinih država i svesti status svakog Amerikanca na status subjekta pod kontrolom i jurisdikcijom vlade Sjedinjenih Država. Očevi osnivači uspostavili su našu vladu kao labavu konfederaciju suverenih država sa državama koje imaju svu značajnu političku vlast. Nikada nisu zamišljali niti namjeravali bilo kakvu učinkovitu političku moć koja bi boravila u Washingtonu. Stvari će se samo pogoršati dok mi, narod, ne izbacimo mjenjače novca iz Washingtona i ne vratimo našu vladu na staro.<br/><br/>Riječ osoba znači korporacija u zakonu. Nije da korporacije nisu ljudi, to je da ljudi nisu korporacije. Bili smo prevareni u prihvaćanju korporativnog identiteta. Pogledajte svoju vozačku dozvolu. Svaki put kad idemo na sud, idemo kao korporacija, a ne kao fizička osoba. Prve korporacije bile su vlade. Gledano logično, ograničena odgovornost za korporaciju je produženje suverenog imuniteta kralju nakon što više nije bio kralj. Iste vladajuće elitne obitelji još uvijek imaju kontrolu, a to seže sve do prvih poznatih izvanzemaljaca o kojima govore sumerski dokumenti. Ista skupina također preuzima zasluge ili krivnju za sve religije i tajna društva.<br/><br/>Kakve to veze ima? Razmislite o tome, cijeli Kongres i Senat su predstava pasa i ponija, pravi brokeri moći koji kontroliraju sve su u sjeni, rade poslove, rade što žele, s AL-CIA-DA i MOSSAD-om tamo ubijaju sve koji se ne slažu s tim šupcima iz vlade u sjeni koji stvarno vode sve.<br/><br/>Zašto je sada toliko važno biti uzrujan zbog ovog sranja? Nakon više od dvjesto godina apsolutnog dokaza da su političari samo maštovita marioneta kako bi nas odvratili od pravog WHEELING-a i DELING-a u stražnjim sobama drugdje, zašto je važno sada kada SCOTUS pokazuje potpuni prezir prema demokraciji u ovoj presudi? Šupci na ovom sudu znaju da pravi dečki s rukama na polugama sustava nisu u Kongresu i Senatu.<br/><br/>Kada je vladavina zakona postala OPSOLETNA u svijetu, općenito, i sve je postalo manje-više ROLLERBALL samo ovaj put, na STEROIDIMA, za i od strane KORPORACIJA, zašto je ova jedina presuda napravila toliku razliku? Zašto svi vi šupci mislite da ovaj 'zaostajući' pokazatelj kraja bilo kakvog izgleda demokratske vlasti čini bilo kakvu razliku.<br/><br/>Hipotetski, recimo da se ova presuda nije dogodila. Misli li itko od vas da korporacije i bogati utjecaji u sjeni ne bi nastavili izvršavati bilo kakvu i svu svoju volju na nas ostale?<br/><br/>Za one od vas koji misle da bi bilo drugačije, predlažem da pronađete lijek za vaš TOTAL NAIVETE !!!!!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>Ova presuda nije napravila ni mrvicu razlike. Uvijek je bilo ovako, dugo prije nego što je SCOTUS u osnovi rekao korporacijama: "Hajde, radite što god želite ... mali ljudi su samo topovska hrana za vaše ratove, chattel za vas da trgujete i prodajete u slobodno vrijeme."<br/><br/>Demokracija je oduvijek bila iluzija, nikada nismo imali kontrolu. Izrada takve planine iz ovog krtičnjaka je apsolutno neopravdana, s obzirom na činjenicu da tijekom cijele 230-godišnje povijesti ove republike, debelim mačkama i bogatim oligarsima nikada nije bio potreban Kongres ili Senat da rade ono što žele, pod bilo kojim okolnostima, ikada. Upravo su to učinili.<br/><br/>Vlada koju ste gledali je bila himera, ne stvarna.<br/><br/>Što prije dođete do te spoznaje, što prije možemo nastaviti s manje pišanja i jadikovanja zbog obične šale o tehničkosti koja je uvijek bila slučaj od prvog dana, a nije nam nametnuta od strane SCOTUS-a, sud nam je tek prilično zakašnjelo objavio što se događa već dugo, dugo, korumpirano vrijeme.<br/><br/>Ja sam ludo zaljubljena u Exxon, a Exxon ima jedno na meni, svadbena zvona u proljeće – malo brzo znam, ali naša ljubav se ne može poreći. Exxon je malo sramežljiv, pa ne očekuj nikakve javne najave, razmišljamo o mirnom vjenčanju u Renu.<br/><br/>Svako poduzeće je jednostavno skupina pojedinaca (malih ili velikih) koji kolektivno ostvaruju svoja individualna prava. Stoga, svako poduzeće ima ista prava kao i ti pojedinci (osim, naravno, prava glasa, koje je rezervirano za same pojedince). Sloboda raspolaganja nečijim bogatstvom kako se smatra prikladnim dolazi zajedno sa slobodom da ga zaradite. Ako je agregat pojedinaca zaradio novac, trebao bi biti slobodan odlučiti kako raspolagati tim novcem. Stvarni problem nije u tome što poduzeća mogu donirati kampanjama, već u tome što je vladi dopušteno da se miješa u poslovanje – tj. da vlada može dati neku uslugu u zamjenu za taj novac. Potrebno nam je razdvajanje trgovine i države na isti način i iz istih razloga kao i razdvajanje crkve i države. Također mi je zanimljivo da je autor kao primjere izabrao dva zakona (zoniranje i minimalna plaća) koji također krše individualna prava. Prva krši imovinska prava, a druga prava pojedinaca na slobodno sklapanje ugovora.<br/><br/>Prema tvojoj Jackoffian analizi, nitko se ne bi trebao miješati u bilo što što itko radi. Recimo, ako sam bio u gužvi, s posebnom subotom navečer, i želim 'slobodu govora' dupe s njim puno na isti način CIA sloboda govora Bobby Kennedy u LA-u jedne noći, to je u redu, jer miješati se sa mnom je ometanje moje pravo na slobodu govora vas.<br/><br/>To je kritična mana kod vas libertarijanskih šupkova... mislite da nema društvene uloge za bilo koju vladavinu prava, da se ništa što se uklapa pod "krajevi opravdavaju znače" racionalnost nikada ne smije miješati, samo neka svatko radi što god želi, i sve funkcionira. To sranje od Ayn Rand ne radi, čovječe, radi do točke gdje netko drugi plaća cijenu za tvoju "što god želim" slobodu prelazi crtu i onda se miješa u moju slobodu.<br/><br/>Pravila i zakoni bi trebali postojati u okviru društva strogo držati pod kontrolom da je dobar stari "Mogu učiniti sve što želim i to je samo ja biti slobodan" linija konjskih govana.<br/><br/>Korporacije nemaju nikakva prava, glupane! Globalno, oni su razlog zašto postoji toliko mnogo propalih država, opljačkanih voljom korporatokrata sa sjedištem u SAD-u koji misle da se sloboda njihovog govora prevodi u: "Učinite ono što vam kažemo ili ćemo vas bombardirati da dobijemo vaše resurse koje trebamo" vrsta silovanja i pljačke.<br/><br/>Jednog dana, nadam se da će te neki seronja zajebavati sa svojim "slobodnim govorom" i onda ćemo čuti tvoju jadnu guzicu kako cvili o tome kako te je zakon iznevjerio. U vašem libertarijanskom svijetu 'Mogu raditi što želim', jedina vladavina prava je ona koju izmišljate kako biste opravdali svoj krajnji cilj. Za vas će onda biti zabavno vidjeti kako se nosite s tuđim tumačenjem vaše granice kao malo neugodnosti za njegove ciljeve, koji nisu nužno poštivali vaše granice, za prokletu sigurnost!<br/><br/>Netko po imenu "uh huh, točno." možda ima logičnu točku skrivenu u šumi nazivanja i zlostavljanja slamnatim čovjekom, ali što kažete na ovo: Korporacije su izumi države koji su stvoreni da prenesu neke od rizika poslovanja od ljudi koji vode posao na dioničare (ako ih ima), kupce (ako ih ima) i javnost. Dakle, ako korporacija počini prijevaru, to je korporacija koja je kažnjena (obično) i novčano kažnjena, a ljudi koji vode korporaciju odlaze sa zlatnim rukovanjem. A trošak kazne se prenosi na kupce i plaća se vladi (ne žrtvama!). Prema "Davidovoj" točki, ako bismo odvojili vladu i trgovinu, korporacije bi prestale postojati! Nije loša ideja.<br/><br/>Mislim da je poanta u tome da ako korporacija počini financijski zločin, a nitko ne primijeti (ako drvo padne u šumu i nitko to ne čuje, je li to stvarno buka argument) onda je zločin zapravo dogodilo?<br/><br/>i u dijagramu veitcha, gdje se dvije kvržice sudaraju i međusobno djeluju, ako jedna dođe na granicu druge, tko je sudac onoga tko je prekršen?<br/><br/>Moja poanta je ovo: nema slamnatih argumenata s obzirom na Davidovu asininsku procjenu da korporacije mogu raditi što god žele s napuštenošću. Istina je davanje dozvola korporacijama i oligarsima, ili bilo kome drugome, da rade što žele, kad god to žele, pod pretpostavkom da su pojedinci i da je stoga zajamčena slobodna riječ, apsurdno je i konjsko govno.<br/><br/>korporacije se sastoje od grupa ljudi. ljudi koji bi trebali živjeti po nekom liku vladavine zakona. Kada ne moraju, onda je to "Mogu učiniti sve što želim sve dok me nitko ne uhvati ili me drži odgovornim za moje prijestupe" koji se ovdje događaju.<br/><br/>Ako je to svijet u kojem David želi živjeti, neka ide tamo i neka se to dogodi, ali dovraga, ne očekuj od mene da se ne protivim tom sranju!<br/><br/>Svi se možemo slagati, sve dok se granice ne narušavaju besplatno po volji od strane bilo koga tko misli da njihovo pravo da rade ono što žele zapravo poništava moje pravo da se ne miješaju svojim postupcima.<br/><br/>Što se tiče korporacija, oni nemaju pravo kršiti moja prava, ili vaša, ili bilo tko drugi. Ako oni ne mogu funkcionirati u zajednici kao dobronamjerni i stoga, ne ometajući entitet, onda oni nemaju pravo postojati.<br/><br/>Davidu nisu prijetili, on je seronja jer je tvrdio da je "radi što hoćeš, to je sloboda govora" hrpa konjskih govana. To je la la land sranje. I prigovaram svakome ili bilo čemu tko krši moje granice s tom tvrdnjom o slobodi govora. To je sranje i ti to znaš!<br/><br/>Pa, to je bio šareni odgovor. Nažalost, "uh-uh", ti si daleko od obilježja. Nikad nisam rekao da ljudi imaju pravo kršiti tuđa prava ... i odbacujem "krajevi opravdavaju sredstva" razmišljanja. Da, zakoni bi trebali postojati, ali SAMO za zaštitu prava ljudi. Žao mi je što imate tako iskrivljen i užasno pogrešan pogled na moj argument.<br/><br/>Ispričavam se što sam piškio u tvoje kukuruzne pahuljice. Mislim da sam mislio da ste zaključili da korporacije mogu raditi što god žele pod ovim pravom SLOBODE GOVORA, što je u Amerku danas šala, jer Patriotski akt i neprijavljeno stanje VOJNOG ZAKONA pod kojim živimo od rujna 2001. godine, dalo je vladi mogućnost da suspendira i ili "škripira" Ustav SAD-a i Zakon o pravima.<br/><br/>Nažalost, ljudi imaju samo nekoliko prava. imamo pravo biti oporezovani do točke apsurda. imamo pravo biti regrutirani i postati topovska hrana za oligarhijske ratove. i imamo pravo da umuknemo i budemo tihi dok nas raduju korporacije i oligarsi i bankari. to su naša prava, i nažalost, oni doista uspijevaju, Davide. Mislim da se možemo složiti oko toga!<br/><br/>Još se pitam kako je novajlija Roberts naslijedio vrhovno pravosuđe nakon Rhenquista, a ne tu ulogu idući nekome s više iskustva na klupi. Što "Roberts Court" planira učiniti sljedeće, ipak, za korporacije? Dajte im pravo glasa na izborima kao stvarni ljudi?; možda imaju glasove ljudskih bića koji se računaju kao 3/5 osobe ili manje od njihovog 1?<br/><br/>Još nisam pročitao sve od 183 stranice duge knjige "vlada", ali smatram da su ove zastrašujuće izjave u njima ne samo proturječne njihovim ekspanzivnim akcijama u ovom slučaju, već i nešto o odricanju od njihove dužnosti:<br/><br/>"najteža i najosjetljivija dužnost koju je ovaj sud pozvan izvršiti." Blodgett protiv Holdena, 275 U.S. 142, 147–148 (1927) (Holmes, J., concurring). Budući da su ulozi tako visoki, naša standardna praksa je da se suzdržimo od rješavanja ustavnih pitanja osim kada je to potrebno za odlučivanje o određenim potraživanjima pred nama. Vidi Ashwander protiv PDV-a, 297 U.S. 288, 346-348 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concur-ring). Ova politika podrazumijeva i našu spremnost da konstruiramo dvosmislene statute kako bismo izbjegli ustavne probleme i našu praksu "nikada ne formulirati pravilo ustavnog prava šire nego što to zahtijevaju točne činjenice na koje se treba primijeniti". Sjedinjene Države protiv Raines, 362<br/>U. S. 17, 21 (1960.) (citat Liverpool, New York & Philadelphia S. S. Co. protiv povjerenika za iseljavanje, 113<br/>U.S. 33, 39 (1885).<br/>Većina i neslaganje ujedinjeni su u izražavanju vjernosti ovim načelima. Ante, na 12; post, na 14 (STEVENS, J., dijelom suglasan, a dijelom neslaganje). >><br/><br/>Roberts, na temelju njegovih laži tijekom potvrde od strane DEMS-a koji je gurnuo svoju lažnu guzicu kroz proces mach brzinom, mora biti "optužio" jer je jebeni lažljivac. On je izričito izjavio da neće ići tim putem pisanja odluka koje se ne temelje na utvrđenim, nekontroverznim konceptima američkog Ustava ... i ovdje je jasno učinio upravo suprotno od toga.<br/><br/>Prava krivnja bi trebala biti na ramenima kurvinih sisača u SENAT-u koji su potvrdili kurvinog sina na prvom mjestu, navodeći da neće glasati protiv njegove potvrde jer su čuvali svoje streljivo za PRAVU PRIJETNJU NAMA.<br/><br/>Krivim jebene DINOKRATE više nego ovu lažljivu gomilu govana po imenu Roberts, kretene poput SCHUMER-a i onog drugog šupka iz Illinoisa, i onog lažljivog cionističkog gada Levina iz Michigana. Samo par njih je moglo zaustaviti Alitovu potvrdu, a onda Robertsovu.<br/><br/>Tvrdnja da je sve ovo doista oblačenje prozora je ispravna, a istina je, iako je očito kršenje naših prava u cijeloj ploči, da su ovi ološ u SCOTUS-u samo post-činjenica, tvrdeći da su nas jebali dugo, dugo, dugo vremena.<br/><br/>Istina je da nikada nije bilo važno što smo mislili da se događa, jer korporacije već dugo funkcioniraju izvan zakona i nitko ih nije smatrao odgovornima. Sami gadovi koji sjede na SCOTUS-u su dobročinitelji zla i pohlepe korporacija koje im pružaju povrate za njihove odluke, u obliku dioničkih dividendi.<br/><br/>Na žalost, fokusiranje na korumpirane SCOTUS-e nam ne pomaže mnogo. To je kao da kažete očito, i očekujete da bude kažnjivo, kada nije.<br/><br/>Sjebani smo bez obzira na to kako gledamo na to, ali bit će dan pomirenja. Jednom kada oduzmu svaki posljednji trag osobnog dostojanstva cijele srednje klase u ovoj zemlji, bit će pakla za platiti. Biti će nasilna, krvava reakcija kakva je viđena samo u Francuskoj, ali će se na kraju vratiti kući da se skrasimo ovdje.<br/><br/>Komunisti su dugo bili u poslu poticanja klasnog rata po ekonomskim linijama i zagradama. Pokušajte razmišljati više u smislu ustavne klase od "srednje klase" kao što njihovi lingvisti vole. Radi bolje, IMO, da ih baciti iz njihovih planova igre.<br/><br/>Ono što se sada događa je ubrzanje u shvaćanju od strane Pastira da nešto ozbiljno nije u redu, i da fasada i iluzija postaju tanke i padaju, otkrivajući ružnu, višestruko pipakiranu ROTHSCHILD zvijer iza korporativnog pritiska za više moći i apsolutne vladavine.<br/><br/>Kao "srednja klasa" ili kako god to želite nazvati, postaje sve više desetkovana i uništena, u konačnici dovoljno Sheeple će se probuditi do točke gdje će shvatiti da je ili ustati i boriti se ili umrijeti na sve četiri.<br/><br/>Sustav ROTHSCHILDS se urušava sam po sebi, zbog previše izvan kontrole, nekontroliranog GREED-a, a sada, to je kao visoka zgrada koja ide naprijed-nazad kao klatno u potresu, u nekom trenutku će konačno 'uhvatiti' i pasti. mi smo na kraju igre, kao što ćete i vi, demokracije i lažnog ekonomskog sustava koji se provodio na svima, tako da će doći do sudara sa STVARNOŠĆU uskoro, i to neće biti lijepo.<br/><br/>Da sam na Scotusu, pobrinuo bih se da ti avioni budu napunjeni gorivom, piloti čekaju, za njihovo posljednje paragvajsko putovanje do Bushovog kompleksa gdje će se sakriti kada balon konačno dođe ovdje.<br/><br/>Ali sve više i više, čini se da se jako zalažu za Treći svjetski rat kako bi skinuli oči sa svih umova koji pušu, nevjerojatni HUBRI njihovih glava.<br/><br/>Uistinu, dolazi dan obračuna, i neće biti lijep.<br/><br/>Komentar po onome što mislim da se događa sada je ovo .. &#124;<br/>2. veljače 2010.<br/>&#124; Odgovori<br/><br/>Slažem se da su sustavi koji se urušavaju njihovi, a ne američki, i provjerite ovaj link s Rense.com:<br/><br/>Izgleda kao ružna, multi-pipkasta ROTHSCHILD zvijer iza korporatokracije pokušava se prerušiti u offshore naftnu platformu ili nešto slično, zar ne?<br/><br/>U svom nastojanju za Trećim svjetskim ratom, oni također guraju za pobunu ovdje odbaciti Ustav u ogorčenosti i preziru tako da ga mogu zamijeniti sa svojim vlastitim dizajnom. Zvuči kao izdaja za mene.<br/><br/>U mojoj vlastitoj ideji i razumijevanju moraju postojati ograničenja na ono što predstavlja govor kako bi se spriječilo kopileizaciju termina i pretjerano liberalno tumačenje Prvog amandmana.<br/><br/>Ne trebamo doprijeti do pitanja ima li Vlada uvjerljiv interes da spriječi strane pojedince ili udruge da utječu na politički proces naše nacije. Usp. 2 U.S.C. §441e (zabrana doprinosa i rashoda primjenjiva na "strane državljane"). Odjeljak 441b nije ograničen na korporacije ili udruženja koja su osnovana u stranim zemljama ili financirana pretežno od strane stranih dioničara. Odjeljak 441b stoga bi bio preširok čak i ako bismo pretpostavili, argumentirajući, da vlada ima uvjerljiv interes za ograničavanje stranog utjecaja na naš politički proces.<br/>Sjedinjene Američke Države, na 615. >><br/><br/>SAD je bankrotirao kada je FDR pozvao zlato. Nismo imali više zlata za plaćanje papira koji smo posudili od FED-a. Sada je u godišnjem bankrotu. Vlada je sada privatna kao BLACKWATER. Sve vladine agencije su navedene na DUNN AND BRADSTREET. Zajedničko pravo koje ustav određuje odnosi se na fizičke ljude. Sve poslovanje od strane sudova danas je korporativno značenje da se gleda kao na pojedinačne korporacije. Postojimo po ugovoru s državom. Sjetite se 14. amandmana. Prije toga nije bilo američkih građana. Većina nas je nesvjesno zatražila američko korporativno državljanstvo. Moramo se pozabaviti pravilom bankovne elite. Gotovo svi vodeći REPS i DEMS članovi su VIJEĆA ZA STRANE ODNOSE ili TLC-a. Pogledajte povijest onih koji su započeli i kontroliraju ih. Rush, Glenn i Sean su svi lažljivci i bankari. Obama je lutka za CFR. Istina iz 911 ima mnogo više značenja i služila bi ujedinjenju poštenih ljudi u ovoj zemlji.<br/><br/>Ja stvarno ne vjerujem da sam korporacija ili građanin jedne, ali, ako gubermint misli tako, znači li odluka SCOTUS-a da nema više ograničenja doprinosa kampanje za bilo koga, tvrtke ili pojedince? Radije bih da se novac ukloni iz našeg izbornog procesa u potpunosti - jednako vrijeme na američkim emitiranim valovima dano je besplatno za sve kandidate |
| And so the TWEWY Spriting Thread army set off, their destination being Japan. Unfortunately, no airline whatsoever would let them on board because of their rather large amassment of weapons of moderate destruction. And pitchtorches, which constituted both a fire and a stabbing hazard. And so, they just went home and downloaded the movie Kanon wanted to watch illegally. They gave it 7/10 stars on rotten tomatoes. The End.<br/><br/>Spoiler:The bottom right Sprite is the new one.<br/><br/>Highlight this box with your cursor to read the spoiler text.

Besides, no one else took the easy, predictable route, so somebody had to. Peace out.<br/><br/>The first sprite was half made by me. The second row contains a teaser for the continuation of the clown sprites i made a while back. And the third row is just a few old sprites that i decided to fix up and redo some parts.<br/><br/>So I just joined, and tried to make a sprite, it turned out ok, but it seemed like a lot of work, and I only made a few changes to neku. How do you make the complicated ones?<br/><br/>Spoiler:<br/><br/>Highlight this box with your cursor to read the spoiler text.<br/><br/>Spoiler:<br/><br/>How to get better at spriting:<br/><br/>1. To start off, master the art of recoloring sprites and shading. 2. Next start copying and pasting body parts to other sprites. E.x Take the arm band off of neku and put it on joshua. 3. Start small by switching around body parts and re-coloring them. (in other words, just experiment and see which combo you like) 4. Then start to challenging yourself to make more complex sprites. Instead of copying and pasting and recoloring, you can try and draw clothes or faces. 5. PRACTICE PRACTICE AND MORE PRACTICE. Keep practicing and experimenting and never give upPeace out.<br/><br/>Sometimes people need to be reminded not to give up so easily and continue to persist. | I tako je vojska TWEWY Spriting Thread krenula, a njihovo odredište bio je Japan. Nažalost, nijedna zrakoplovna kompanija ih ne bi pustila na brod zbog njihove prilično velike gomile oružja umjerenog uništenja. I baklje, koje su predstavljale i vatru i opasnost od ubadanja. I tako su samo otišli kući i skinuli film Kanon koji su htjeli ilegalno gledati. Dali su mu 7/10 zvjezdica na trulim rajčicama.

Za početak, svladajte umjetnost prebojavanja sprita i sjenčanja. 2. Zatim počnite kopirati i zalijepiti dijelove tijela na druge sprites. E.x Skinite traku za ruku s neku i stavite je na joshua. 3. Počnite s malim prebacivanjem dijelova tijela i ponovnom bojom. (drugim riječima, samo eksperimentirajte i pogledajte koja vam se kombinacija sviđa) 4. Zatim se počnite izazivati kako biste napravili složenije spriteove. Umjesto kopiranja i lijepljenja i prebojavanja, možete pokušati nacrtati odjeću ili lica. 5. PRAKSA PRAKSE I VIŠE PRAKSE.

| Interpretive Summary: This book chapter reviews various aspects of what is needed for the selection of model weeds to answer questions pertinent to weed science. Specifically, the chapter covers why we need model species, attributes of model species, and provides the current state of knowledge and resources that have been developed for a few key weeds such as leafy spurge, Canada thistle, waterhemp, and purple false brome that may make them good potential models.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract:<br/>Selection of a limited number of model weeds and development of genomic-based tools and resources will facilitate studies on the ecology, biology, physiology and development of weedy species. Such studies will help answer fundamental questions of concern to weed scientists. However, to ensure the weed science community can appropriately and fully utilize these model weeds, they will need to be carefully selected. Various attributes such as ease of study, weedy characteristics, and importance as a weedy species will need to be considered. Additionally, the availability of existing genomic resources can be used to extend the list of viable model weeds. Several resources have also been developed specifically for weeds such as leafy spurge, Canada thistle, waterhemp, and purple false brome. | Sažetak: U ovom poglavlju knjige razmatraju se različiti aspekti onoga što je potrebno za odabir modela korova kako bi se odgovorilo na pitanja relevantna za znanost o korovima. Konkretno, poglavlje pokriva zašto su nam potrebne vrste modela, atributi vrsta modela, te pruža trenutno stanje znanja i resursa koji su razvijeni za nekoliko ključnih korova kao što su lisnati korijen, kanadski čičak, konoplja i ljubičasti lažni brom koji ih mogu učiniti dobrim potencijalnim modelima.<br/><br/>Tehnički sažetak:<br/>Odabirom ograničenog broja modela korova i razvojem alata i resursa na temelju genoma olakšat će se proučavanje ekologije, biologije, fiziologije i razvoja korovnih vrsta. Takve studije pomoći će odgovoriti na temeljna pitanja koja zabrinjavaju znanstvenike korova. Međutim, kako bi se osiguralo da znanstvena zajednica korova može na odgovarajući način i u potpunosti iskoristiti ove modele korova, morat će ih pažljivo odabrati. Potrebno je razmotriti različite atribute kao što su lakoća proučavanja, karakteristike korova i važnost kao korovne vrste. Osim toga, dostupnost postojećih genomskih resursa može se koristiti za proširenje popisa održivih modela korova. Nekoliko resursa također je razvijeno posebno za korov kao što su lisnati čičak, kanadski čičak, konoplja i ljubičasti lažni brom. |
