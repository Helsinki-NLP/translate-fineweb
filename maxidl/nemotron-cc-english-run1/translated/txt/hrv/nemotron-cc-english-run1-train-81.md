| Forty-nine years ago today, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act of 1965.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Nearly a century ago, the 15th Amendment to the Constitution stated, "The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of race, color or previous condition of servitude." And nearly a century before that, our nation's founding fathers set in motion the great experiment of American democracy by declaring that "all men are created equal."<br/><br/>The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was a belated acknowledgment that even in America, our foundational ideals carry little weight if not protected by the rule of law. That's why Section 2 of the 15th Amendment granted Congress the "power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation."<br/><br/>And indeed, the codified language of the Voting Rights Act was able to achieve what the Reconstruction-era Congress and Thomas Jefferson could not. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act—and the civil rights movement from which they emerged—served as the catalyst for a dramatic increase in the opportunity for black Americans to participate in the democratic process.<br/><br/>For example, only 6.7 percent of eligible black Mississippians were registered to vote as of 1962; by 1969 that figure had reached 66.5 percent. Today, Mississippi has more black elected officials than any other state.<br/><br/>The protections put in place by the Voting Rights Act were long overdue when they were passed, representative of the arduous struggle with which they were achieved. But unthinkably, these protections are now under assault, jeopardizing the progress our nation worked so hard to achieve.<br/><br/>Last year, in the case of Shelby County v. Holder, the U.S. Supreme Court gutted a key component of the Voting Rights Act that enabled prior federal review to ensure nondiscrimination before any new voting law went into effect.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Sadly, the response of Republican leaders has been to do nothing. Sen. Ted Cruz and Gov. Rick Perry went out of their way to praise the Supreme Court's decision. Sen. Rand Paul dismissed the continued necessity of the Voting Rights Act by noting, "We have an African-American president."<br/><br/>While the election of President Barack Obama was indeed a historic milestone, it is dangerous to think that it absolves us from remaining vigilant against the lingering consequences of our nation's past. The haste with which states have moved to enact voting restrictions is confirmation that the protections put in place by Section 4 are still necessary.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Republican governors have signed strict photo-identification restrictions into law as the solution to a virtually nonexistent problem of voter impersonation, disproportionately hurting women, young people, working families and the African-American community. It's disingenuous for Republicans like Paul to seek the votes of these communities when they believe "there's nothing wrong with" putting restrictions in place that make it harder for these constituencies to vote.<br/><br/>Republicans have also sought to restrict early-voting periods, including the Sunday before Election Day, when African-American churches have had great success with Souls to the Polls programs.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>These restrictions represent a callous effort by Republicans to make voting harder, based on narrow, short-term political calculations that Republicans can win elections by shrinking the size of the electorate.<br/><br/>Democrats have a very different mission when it comes to voting: to ensure that every eligible voter can register, that every registered voter can vote and that every vote is accurately counted.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>The Democratic National Committee's Voter Expansion Project reflects our belief that greater voter participation strengthens our nation and our democracy. We'll continue to use our unmatched institutional knowledge to protect voting rights against legislation and tactics that would attempt to suppress the vote. And because the best defense is a good offense, we're also working to expand the vote by deploying our technology and data resources to register new voters.<br/><br/>On this anniversary, one of the best ways we can honor those who struggled—and in some cases gave their very lives—for the legislation's passage is for Republicans in Congress to join Democrats in passing the Voting Rights Amendment Act to restore the promise of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Democrat, represents Florida's 23rd Congressional District in the United States Congress. Since 2011, she has served as chair of the Democratic National Committee. Follow her on Twitter.<br/><br/>The Root aims to foster and advance conversations about issues relevant to the black Diaspora by presenting a variety of opinions from all perspectives, whether or not those opinions are shared by our editorial staff. | Prije četrdeset i devet godina, predsjednik Lyndon B. Johnson potpisao je Zakon o glasačkim pravima iz 1965. godine.<br/><br/>Oglašavanje<br/><br/>Prije gotovo stotinu godina, 15. amandman Ustava glasao je: "Pravo građana Sjedinjenih Država da glasaju ne smije biti uskraćeno ili skraćeno od strane Sjedinjenih Država ili bilo koje države zbog rase, boje ili prethodnog stanja ropstva." I gotovo stotinu godina prije toga, očevi osnivači naše nacije pokrenuli su veliki eksperiment američke demokracije izjavljujući da su "svi ljudi stvoreni jednaki".<br/><br/>Zakon o glasačkim pravima iz 1965. bio je zakašnjelo priznanje da čak i u Americi, naši temeljni ideali imaju malu težinu ako nisu zaštićeni vladavinom prava. Zato je odjeljak 2 15. amandmana Kongresu dodijelio "ovlašćenje da provede ovaj članak odgovarajućim zakonodavstvom".<br/><br/>I doista, kodificirani jezik Zakona o glasačkim pravima bio je u stanju postići ono što Kongres iz doba obnove i Thomas Jefferson nisu mogli. Zakon o građanskim pravima iz 1964. i Zakon o glasačkim pravima - i pokret za građanska prava iz kojih su nastali - služili su kao katalizator za dramatično povećanje mogućnosti crnih Amerikanaca da sudjeluju u demokratskom procesu.<br/><br/>Na primjer, samo 6,7 posto prihvatljivih crnih Mississippijanaca registrirano je za glasanje od 1962. godine; do 1969. ta je brojka dosegla 66.5 posto. Danas, Mississippi ima više crnih izabranih dužnosnika nego bilo koja druga država.<br/><br/>Zaštite uvedene Zakonom o glasačkim pravima bile su davno donesene, što je predstavljalo tešku borbu s kojom su postignute. Ali nezamislivo, ove zaštite su sada pod napadom, ugrožavajući napredak koji je naša nacija tako naporno radila da postigne.<br/><br/>Prošle godine, u slučaju Shelby County protiv Holdera, Vrhovni sud SAD-a iscrpio je ključnu komponentu Zakona o glasačkim pravima koja je omogućila prethodnu federalnu reviziju kako bi se osigurala nediskriminacija prije nego što bilo koji novi zakon o glasanju stupi na snagu.<br/><br/>Oglašavanje<br/><br/>Senator Ted Cruz i guverner Rick Perry hvalili su odluku Vrhovnog suda. Senator Rand Paul odbacio je kontinuiranu nužnost Zakona o glasačkim pravima, napominjući: "Imamo afroameričkog predsjednika."<br/><br/>Iako je izbor predsjednika Baracka Obame doista bio povijesna prekretnica, opasno je misliti da nas oslobađa budnosti zbog dugotrajnih posljedica prošlosti naše nacije. Žurba s kojom su se države pomaknule prema uvođenju ograničenja glasovanja potvrda je da su zaštitne mjere uvedene odjeljkom 4. i dalje potrebne.<br/><br/>Oglašavanje<br/><br/>Republikanski guverneri potpisali su stroga ograničenja foto-identifikacije u zakonu kao rješenje za gotovo nepostojeći problem oponašanja birača, nesrazmjerno ozljeđujući žene, mlade ljude, radne obitelji i afroameričku zajednicu. Nepristojno je da republikanci poput Paula traže glasove tih zajednica kada vjeruju da "nema ništa loše u" postavljanju ograničenja koja otežavaju tim izbornim jedinicama da glasaju.<br/><br/>Republikanci su također nastojali ograničiti razdoblja ranog glasanja, uključujući nedjelju prije izbora, kada su afroameričke crkve imale veliki uspjeh s programima Souls na izborima.<br/><br/>Oglašavanje<br/><br/>Ove restrikcije predstavljaju bezobzirni napor republikanaca da otežaju glasanje, na temelju uskih, kratkoročnih političkih proračuna da republikanci mogu pobijediti na izborima smanjivanjem veličine birača.<br/><br/>Demokrati imaju vrlo različitu misiju kada je riječ o glasovanju: osigurati da se svaki birač koji ima pravo glasa može registrirati, da svaki registrirani birač može glasovati i da se svaki glas točno broji.<br/><br/>Oglašavanje<br/><br/>Projekt proširenja birača Demokratskog nacionalnog odbora odražava naše uvjerenje da veće sudjelovanje birača jača našu naciju i našu demokraciju. Nastavit ćemo koristiti naše neusporedivo institucionalno znanje kako bismo zaštitili glasačka prava protiv zakona i taktike koja bi pokušala suzbiti glasanje. A budući da je najbolja obrana dobar napad, također radimo na proširenju glasovanja raspoređivanjem naše tehnologije i podatkovnih resursa za registraciju novih birača.<br/><br/>Na ovu obljetnicu, jedan od najboljih načina na koji možemo odati počast onima koji su se borili - au nekim slučajevima i dali svoje živote - za usvajanje zakona je da se republikanci u Kongresu pridruže demokratima u donošenju Zakona o izmjenama i dopunama glasačkih prava kako bi obnovili obećanje Zakona o glasačkim pravima iz 1965. godine.<br/><br/>Oglašavanje<br/><br/>Debbie Wasserman Schultz, demokratka, predstavlja 23. kongresni okrug Floride u Kongresu Sjedinjenih Država.

| Q&A: Vatican safeguarding expert Fr Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>13 June 2021<br/><br/>Fr Hans Zollner SJ. Image: Australian Jesuits.<br/><br/>The President of the Centre for Child Protection at the Gregorian University in Rome, and a member of the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors, Fr Hans Zollner SJ, was in Australia in 2018 to speak to Catholic ministry leaders and survivors.<br/><br/>Michael McVeigh from Jesuit Communications sat down with him during the visit to explore how the Church is responding to the abuse crisis internationally, and what can be learned from our experiences in Australia.<br/><br/>MM: This is your third trip to Australia. You've visited quite a few other countries to see how the Church is responding to abuse around the world. Can you give us some idea of what the global picture looks like?<br/><br/>Fr Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>HZ: My understanding, after having visited about 50 countries on five or six continents, is that the Church is really starting to move over the last couple of years on the issue of doing justice to victims, of listening to them, and doing whatever can be done in terms of safeguarding.<br/><br/>I was with the Jesuit Provincials from all over Africa at the end of April, and the President of the Jesuit Assistancy of Africa and Madagascar is very much committed and dedicated to this. He has put up a thorough action plan for formation and for introducing guidelines all over the place. It's a very considerate and very deliberate effort to do whatever can be done to be proactively engaged as Jesuits in Africa — in a continent where until a few years ago all of this was a foreign language.<br/><br/>One of the challenges of trying to develop this global approach is that you're dealing with so many cultures, and so many different understandings. How do you bring this together and try to provide training and support religious communities tackling these issues?<br/><br/>This is one of the major questions we have. I think what I can do is stimulate discussion, stimulate reflection, and prepare people as much as possible so that they can do the groundwork.<br/><br/>The Centre for Child Protection at the Gregorian University does not pretend to have the response to every question. Not only because we don't know the specific contexts — we might know a few of them, but we're talking about thousands of cultures, we're talking about hundreds of languages, we're talking about very diverse legal backgrounds. It varies even sometimes within one country, such as Australia where you have states within the Commonwealth of Australia that have different laws than other states.<br/><br/>I am somebody who tries to elicit and stimulate discussion and reflection. I'm also very happy to listen to people.<br/><br/>You mentioned the need to listen and support victims in being heard. We've obviously had the Royal Commission here in Australia, but what are some of the other ways that you've seen that the voices of victims are being supported around the world?<br/><br/>In France there is one diocese that has established what they call 'The Listening Space'. There, victims can come forward and they can express themselves. The bishop is present. It's an open space in which people who have been hurt tremendously are free at least to express what they want to ask from the Church leadership etc.<br/><br/>There are other places in the USA or in other countries where victims have been invited by dioceses, by Provinces, by the leadership of the Church, to come forward. I have to say that overall I think there is a good will, and there are more people like bishops and provincials who listen to victims than we know. But there is no one model of giving victims not only the space to express themselves and be listened to, but also to engage actively in Church development.<br/><br/>In terms of setting up spaces for support for victims, what are some of the things you've seen that could really help — and that we could be considering here in Australia?<br/><br/>One of the major points that many victims bring up is, 'Can't we have, within parish settings, within schools settings, a regular conversation going on that includes survivors of abuse as regular members of a committee, a commission, a sounding board, a feedback group or something like that?' So that this voice is not only brought in on a specific occasion, or where a person feels like he or she is at a point to be able to speak out about it, but [is heard] on a regular basis — build that voice into the system.<br/><br/>That will help all of us. It will help survivors and victims because they will feel welcome and appreciated in the specific experience, and in the specific life challenges, that they went through. Secondly it will help the community at large, because we can at least make ourselves more and more sensitive to what the concerns and specific needs of survivors are — that can also talk to the needs of young people.<br/><br/>M: We have strong groups of survivors here in Australia who have been able to support each other through that process. But what you're saying is that we need some way of supporting those groups, and supporting those people, through our own institutions as well?<br/><br/>And I think we need to be creative. It will work for one school and one parish and one diocese in one way, and for others in a different way. Because the survivors with whom I am in constant contact, they have quite similar requests, and similar experiences in regard to being welcomed in the Church or not — feeling thrown out or dismissed. But they have also among themselves quite different expectations. So I have learned that you have also to be very forthcoming in accepting the differences in what this specific group, or this specific survivor, wants, requests and needs.<br/><br/>M: Survivors talk about wanting to have their stories heard and acknowledged. We've had the Royal Commission here in Australia, which provided an independent process where victims could come forward. Is there a need for something like that in terms of a truth, justice and reconciliation process for the Church internationally?<br/><br/>H: Yes, I think there is a need for that internationally. But I think first every local church needs to do its own homework. I don't see it happening very soon that some such council or commission would be established to look into this area for the whole Church. The Church has a membership of 1.3 billion people, and is present in 190 countries, with all kinds of differences in expectations concerning psychological, spiritual and financial support.<br/><br/>There is one thing that I have come across consistently in communicating with, working with and listening to victims, and that is that they want to be listened to. So if there was the feeling that victims were constantly being listened to — in Rome and elsewhere — I think that would give a great relief to many victims.<br/><br/>I think [Pope Francis'] concern, especially with regard to your question, is that the local churches do whatever they can so that victims will be listened to in that particular country. I have a list of people who want to speak to the Holy Father directly, and physically it is impossible. I was there in 2014 to translate for two German survivors who were chosen with two Irish and two English survivors when he received the six of them at home. He took the whole morning listening to them one after the other. For each one, he was there for 40 to 45 minutes. Were he to do this for every survivor he couldn't sleep anymore.<br/><br/>His example is modelling for the whole Catholic Church the way victims and survivors are received, welcomed and listened to. I think if the bishops and the provincials in this world, in all countries, followed his example, many survivors would be really appreciative of that.<br/><br/>Archbishop Diarmud Martin was recently quoted just before the World Meeting of Families, about the Pontifical Commission, saying that it's too small as it's currently set up to achieve what it needs to achieve. What's your take on that? Does the Church need to be putting more resources into how it's overseeing those issues?<br/><br/>At the moment we are 16 members from basically all continents, and the major language groups. We represent a variety of disciplines and professions, and the purpose of the commission — as the statutes that have just been promulgated state — is to provide counsel to the Holy Father.<br/><br/>A common misunderstanding about the commission is first that we deal with cases of allegations. That is not the case. We have no juridical or administrative power in regards to cases, because when it comes to allegations of abuse the tribunals and procedure are set.<br/><br/>A second misunderstanding is that we promote, directly, things on the ground. Our first and foremost goal is that we advise the Holy Father on issues.<br/><br/>So from my point of view, yes, we need to invest more. But we need to invest more on the local level, and we need to make sure that the proposals from the Pontifical Commission are forwarded to the Holy Father — which normally the President does — and then there is a follow-up process that reflects what we have given as our advice.<br/><br/>In Australia, Catholic Professional Standards Limited is overseeing the Church's response and providing guidelines and support for ensuring all the institutions in the Church are child-safe institutions. Is there a need for some kind of organisational support from Rome for those bishops and dioceses that are struggling to form these institutions and provide safeguarding in those dioceses?<br/><br/>I think ultimately the commission will develop in that line. They are now in the process of hiring experts in those areas.<br/><br/>I think the Church needs to understand that the local churches can learn from each other mutually. And my understanding has always been — and I think the Holy Father has reminded us — that the Church will not function as a centralised company. It does not work like that, effectively. Every bishop, every bishops conference, has, to some extent, its life on its own. What we need to learn more is to open channels of mutual communication.<br/><br/>There are a number of things that people blame for abuse in the Church. As a priest and a psychologist, and as someone who has met and worked with survivors, what are your thoughts on that issue?<br/><br/>I think the question of where does abuse come from is the most important one, and the Pope has addressed that in his letter to the people of God published on 20 August. He says in the first paragraph, and repeats it over and over again, that the question of sexual abuse is always linked — or almost always linked — not only to the question of abuse of power, but also to the abuse of conscience.<br/><br/>So the real fundamental question of abuse is much more complex than just [the question of] sexuality — be it heterosexual or homosexual. It's a power issue, and there we have to really work on the question of how do we understand priesthood, how to we understand bishophood, how do we understand and live out our ministries? What are the boundaries?<br/><br/>That's why I'm very happy that the Jesuit Province in Australia is establishing a Code of Conduct. Because we don't talk only about sexual abuse of minors. We talk about sexual abuse of adults, and we talk about abuse in other ways — like abuse of conscience, where you dictate to someone what you think, or you pretend to know by God, and you can tell another person, 'You need to do that', against the conscience of that person.<br/><br/>Many people think celibacy produces abuse. As I always say, celibacy as such is not cause for abusing — otherwise how do we explain that 99.9 per cent of all abusers do not live a celibate life, and how do we explain that 95 or 96 per cent of all priests do not abuse minors? But, celibacy, or a vow of chastity, that is not really integrated, that is not really lived out properly — yes, that produces a problem. Sometimes people take to drinking, sometime they take to gambling, and sometimes they take to sexual misconduct, with adults and with minors.<br/><br/>The real question about this is how do we deal with the notion of religious spiritual power with which priests and bishops are invested? How can theology help us to understand, and maybe how can sociology, psychology, or business administration help us to define the limits of power, and the necessity of keeping your boundaries | Pitanja i odgovori: Stručnjak za zaštitu Vatikana fra Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>13. lipnja 2021.<br/><br/>Otac Hans Zollner SJ. Slika: Australski isusovci.<br/><br/>Predsjednik Centra za zaštitu djece na Gregorijanskom sveučilištu u Rimu i član Papinskog povjerenstva za zaštitu maloljetnika, fra Hans Zollner SJ, boravio je u Australiji 2018. godine kako bi razgovarao s vođama katoličke službe i preživjelima.<br/><br/>Michael McVeigh iz isusovačkih komunikacija sjeo je s njim tijekom posjeta kako bi istražio kako Crkva reagira na krizu zlostavljanja na međunarodnoj razini i što se može naučiti iz naših iskustava u Australiji.<br/><br/>MM: Ovo je vaše treće putovanje u Australiju. Posjetili ste dosta drugih zemalja kako biste vidjeli kako Crkva reagira na zlostavljanje diljem svijeta. Možete li nam dati neku ideju o tome kako izgleda globalna slika?<br/><br/>Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>HZ: Moje razumijevanje, nakon što sam posjetio oko 50 zemalja na pet ili šest kontinenata, jest da se Crkva u posljednjih nekoliko godina stvarno počinje kretati oko pitanja pravde prema žrtvama, slušajući ih i čineći sve što se može učiniti u pogledu zaštite.<br/><br/>Bio sam s isusovačkim provincijalima iz cijele Afrike krajem travnja, a predsjednik isusovske asistencije za Afriku i Madagaskar je vrlo predan i posvećen tome. Izradio je detaljan akcijski plan za formiranje i uvođenje smjernica posvuda. To je vrlo obziran i vrlo namjeran napor da se učini sve što se može kako bi se proaktivno angažirali kao isusovci u Africi — na kontinentu gdje je do prije nekoliko godina sve to bilo strani jezik.<br/><br/>Jedan od izazova u pokušaju da se razvije ovaj globalni pristup je da imate posla s toliko kultura i toliko različitih razumijevanja. Kako to povezujete i pokušavate pružiti obuku i podršku vjerskim zajednicama koje se bave tim pitanjima?<br/><br/>To je jedno od glavnih pitanja koje imamo. Mislim da mogu potaknuti raspravu, potaknuti razmišljanje i pripremiti ljude što je više moguće kako bi mogli raditi temelje.<br/><br/>Centar za zaštitu djece na Gregorijanskom sveučilištu ne tvrdi da ima odgovor na svako pitanje. Ne samo zato što ne znamo specifične kontekste — možda znamo neke od njih, već govorimo o tisućama kultura, govorimo o stotinama jezika, govorimo o vrlo različitim pravnim pozadinama. Razlikuje se čak i ponekad unutar jedne zemlje, kao što je Australija, gdje imate države unutar Commonwealth of Australia koje imaju različite zakone od drugih država.<br/><br/>Ja sam netko tko pokušava potaknuti i potaknuti raspravu i razmišljanje. Također sam vrlo sretan da slušam ljude.<br/><br/>Spomenuli ste potrebu za slušanjem i podrškom žrtvama da budu saslušane. Očito smo imali Kraljevsku komisiju ovdje u Australiji, ali koji su neki od drugih načina na koje ste vidjeli da se glasovi žrtava podržavaju diljem svijeta?<br/><br/>U Francuskoj postoji jedna biskupija koja je uspostavila ono što oni nazivaju 'Prostor za slušanje'. Tamo žrtve mogu istupiti i mogu se izraziti. Biskup je prisutan. To je otvoreni prostor u kojem ljudi koji su pretrpjeli ogromnu štetu mogu barem slobodno izraziti ono što žele tražiti od crkvenog vodstva itd.<br/><br/>Postoje i druga mjesta u SAD-u ili u drugim zemljama gdje su biskupije, pokrajine, crkveno vodstvo pozivale žrtve da istupe. Moram reći da općenito mislim da postoji dobra volja, a ima više ljudi poput biskupa i provincijalaca koji slušaju žrtve nego što znamo. Ali ne postoji jedan model davanja žrtvama ne samo prostora za izražavanje i slušanje, već i za aktivno sudjelovanje u razvoju Crkve.<br/><br/>Što se tiče postavljanja prostora za podršku žrtvama, koje su neke od stvari koje ste vidjeli da bi stvarno mogle pomoći — i koje bismo mogli razmotriti ovdje u Australiji?<br/><br/>Jedna od glavnih točaka koje mnoge žrtve spominju je: ‘Zar ne možemo imati, unutar župnih prostora, unutar školskih prostora, redoviti razgovor koji uključuje preživjele zlostavljanja kao redovite članove odbora, komisije, zvučne ploče, grupe za povratne informacije ili nešto slično?’ Tako da se taj glas ne dovodi samo u određenoj prigodi, ili gdje se osoba osjeća kao da je u toj točki da može govoriti o tome, već se [čuje] redovito - ugraditi taj glas u sustav.<br/><br/>To će pomoći svima nama. To će pomoći preživjelima i žrtvama jer će se osjećati dobrodošli i cijenjeni u specifičnom iskustvu i specifičnim životnim izazovima kroz koje su prošli. Drugo, pomoći će zajednici u cjelini, jer možemo barem postati sve osjetljiviji na brige i specifične potrebe preživjelih – koje također mogu govoriti o potrebama mladih.<br/><br/>M: Imamo jake skupine preživjelih ovdje u Australiji koji su bili u mogućnosti podržati jedni druge kroz taj proces. Ali ono što želite reći je da nam je potreban neki način podrške tim skupinama, i podrške tim ljudima, kroz naše vlastite institucije također?<br/><br/>I mislim da moramo biti kreativni. To će raditi za jednu školu i jednu župu i jednu biskupiju na jedan način, a za druge na drugačiji način. Budući da su preživjeli s kojima sam u stalnom kontaktu, oni imaju vrlo slične zahtjeve i slična iskustva u vezi s prihvaćanjem u Crkvi ili ne – osjećaj izbacivanja ili odbacivanja. Ali oni također imaju među sobom prilično različita očekivanja. Tako sam naučio da također morate biti vrlo spremni u prihvaćanju razlika u onome što ova određena skupina, ili ovaj specifični preživjeli, želi, zahtjeva i potreba.<br/><br/>M: Preživjeli govore o tome da žele da se njihove priče čuju i priznaju. Imali smo Kraljevsku komisiju ovdje u Australiji, koja je osigurala neovisan proces u kojem žrtve mogu istupiti. Postoji li potreba za nečim takvim u smislu istine, pravde i procesa pomirenja za Crkvu na međunarodnoj razini?<br/><br/>H: Da, mislim da postoji potreba za tim na međunarodnoj razini. Ali mislim da prije svega svaka lokalna crkva mora napraviti svoju domaću zadaću. Ne vidim da će se uskoro dogoditi da se uspostavi neki takav koncil ili povjerenstvo koje će razmotriti ovo područje za cijelu Crkvu. Crkva ima 1,3 milijarde članova i prisutna je u 190 zemalja, sa svim vrstama razlika u očekivanjima u pogledu psihološke, duhovne i financijske podrške.<br/><br/>Postoji jedna stvar s kojom sam se dosljedno susreo u komunikaciji, radu s žrtvama i slušanju žrtava, a to je da oni žele biti saslušani. Dakle, ako je postojao osjećaj da se žrtve stalno slušaju - u Rimu i drugdje - mislim da bi to pružilo veliko olakšanje mnogim žrtvama.<br/><br/>Mislim da je [papa Franjo] zabrinut, osobito u vezi s vašim pitanjem, da lokalne crkve učine sve što mogu kako bi žrtve bile saslušane u toj zemlji. Imam popis ljudi koji žele izravno razgovarati sa Svetim Ocem, a fizički je to nemoguće. Bio sam tamo 2014. da prevedem za dva njemačka preživjela koja su odabrana s dva irska i dva engleska preživjela kada je primio šest od njih kod kuće. Uzeo je cijelo jutro slušajući ih jedan za drugim. Za svakog od njih, bio je tamo 40 do 45 minuta. Da je to učinio za svakog preživjelog, više nije mogao spavati.<br/><br/>Njegov primjer uzor je za cijelu Katoličku Crkvu način na koji su žrtve i preživjeli primljeni, dočekani i saslušani. Mislim da ako bi biskupi i provincijalci u ovom svijetu, u svim zemljama, slijedili njegov primjer, mnogi preživjeli bili bi doista zahvalni na tome.<br/><br/>Nedavno je citiran nadbiskup Diarmud Martin, neposredno prije Svjetskog susreta obitelji, o Papinskom povjerenstvu, rekavši da je ono premalo jer je trenutno postavljeno da postigne ono što treba postići. Kakvo je vaše stajalište o tome? Treba li Crkva uložiti više sredstava u to kako nadgleda ta pitanja?<br/><br/>Trenutno nas je 16 članova sa svih kontinenata i glavnih jezičnih skupina. Mi zastupamo razne discipline i profesije, a svrha povjerenstva – kao i statuta koji su upravo proglašeni – je pružiti savjet Svetom Ocu.<br/><br/>Uobičajeni nesporazum o komisiji je da se prvo bavimo slučajevima optužbi. To nije slučaj. Nemamo nikakvu pravnu ili upravnu ovlast u pogledu predmeta, jer kada je riječ o navodnim zlouporabama, sudovi i postupci su postavljeni.<br/><br/>Drugi nesporazum je da izravno promoviramo stvari na terenu. Naš prvi i najvažniji cilj je da savjetujemo Svetog Oca o pitanjima.<br/><br/>Dakle, s moje točke gledišta, da, moramo ulagati više. Ali moramo više ulagati na lokalnoj razini i moramo se pobrinuti da se prijedlozi Papinskog povjerenstva prosljeđuju Svetom Ocu – što inače čini predsjednik – a zatim slijedi proces koji odražava ono što smo dali kao naš savjet.<br/><br/>U Australiji, Catholic Professional Standards Limited nadgleda odgovor Crkve i pruža smjernice i podršku kako bi se osiguralo da sve institucije u Crkvi budu sigurne za djecu. Postoji li potreba za nekom vrstom organizacijske podrške od strane Rima za one biskupe i biskupije koji se bore za formiranje tih institucija i pružanje zaštite u tim biskupijama?<br/><br/>Mislim da će se u konačnici komisija razvijati u tom smjeru. Oni su sada u procesu zapošljavanja stručnjaka u tim područjima.<br/><br/>Mislim da Crkva treba shvatiti da lokalne crkve mogu učiti jedna od druge. A moje razumijevanje je uvijek bilo – i mislim da nas je Sveti Otac podsjetio – da Crkva neće funkcionirati kao centralizirano društvo. To ne funkcionira tako učinkovito. Svaki biskup, svaka biskupska konferencija, ima, u određenoj mjeri, svoj vlastiti život. Ono što trebamo više naučiti jest otvoriti kanale međusobne komunikacije.<br/><br/>Postoje brojne stvari koje ljudi krive za zlostavljanje u Crkvi. Kao svećenik i psiholog, i kao netko tko se susreo i radio s preživjelima, što mislite o tom pitanju?<br/><br/>Mislim da je pitanje odakle dolazi zlostavljanje najvažnije, a Papa se tome obraća u svom pismu Božjem narodu objavljenom 20. kolovoza. U prvom odlomku kaže i ponavlja iznova da je pitanje seksualnog zlostavljanja uvijek povezano – ili gotovo uvijek povezano – ne samo s pitanjem zlouporabe vlasti, već i sa zlouporabom savjesti.<br/><br/>Dakle, pravo temeljno pitanje zlostavljanja mnogo je složenije od samog pitanja seksualnosti — bilo da je riječ o heteroseksualnom ili homoseksualnom. To je pitanje moći, i tu zaista moramo raditi na pitanju kako razumijemo svećenstvo, kako razumijemo biskupstvo, kako razumijemo i živimo naše službe? Koje su granice?<br/><br/>Zato mi je drago što isusovačka provincija u Australiji uspostavlja Kodeks ponašanja, jer ne govorimo samo o seksualnom zlostavljanju maloljetnika. Govorimo o seksualnom zlostavljanju odraslih, i govorimo o zlostavljanju na druge načine — kao što je zlostavljanje savjesti, gdje diktirate nekome što mislite, ili se pretvarate da znate od Boga, i možete reći drugoj osobi, "Morate to učiniti", protiv savjesti te osobe.<br/><br/>Mnogi ljudi misle da celibat uzrokuje zlostavljanje. Kao što uvijek kažem, celibat kao takav nije razlog za zlostavljanje – inače, kako objasniti da 99,9 posto svih zlostavljača ne živi u celibatu, i kako objasniti da 95 ili 96 posto svih svećenika ne zlostavlja maloljetnike? Ali, celibat, ili zavjet čednosti, koji zapravo nije integriran, koji se zapravo ne živi kako treba — da, to stvara problem. Ponekad ljudi počnu piti, ponekad počnu kockati, a ponekad počnu seksualno zlostavljati, s odraslima i maloljetnicima.<br/><br/>Pravo pitanje o tome je kako se nositi s pojmom vjerske duhovne moći s kojom su uloženi svećenici i biskupi? Kako nam teologija može pomoći da razumijemo, a možda i kako nam sociologija, psihologija ili poslovna administracija mogu pomoći da definiramo granice moći i nužnost održavanja svojih granica. |
| I'm not surprised by this mismatch. In fact, I'd even go so far as to say this isn't something that will ever change, nor should we get all steamed up about changing it. In 10 years, we'll still have bleeding edge, complex items in the biggest concerns list, and the things we're finally getting around to understanding will be the major parts of our spending.<br/><br/>Now, Gunnar and Andy both have excellent points, specifically about IT teams seeing IT problems and solving them with IT solutions; in fact, I'm positive their points hold merit.<br/><br/>But I think there are other ideas that trump those (I did comment on their blogs about it, and later decided I should just blog here). Those top 3 concerns are bleedingly new such that:<br/><br/>we fear new things because we don't understand them, or don't understand them because they're new.<br/><br/>they're too new for us to have solid approaches to handling them.<br/><br/>they're too new for us to know if we should be worried or not! we tend to default to paranoid/worried, which is good!<br/><br/>too new to have obvious budget items assigned to them. Can I buy a box or some software that provide "cloud security" or "social media security?"<br/><br/>they're so new the business doesn't even know how to use them or what they want out of them. Let alone how we can secure them while still meeting or at least not stomping all over business needs. If the business doesn't even know how to use them yet, I'm not sure security is in any position to guide that usage securely.<br/><br/>It also should be mentioned that these new things are being largely pushed via consumerland and into the business, with IT as a sort of, "Oh yeah," thought. Firewalls, AV, AM, Auth are all IT responses to typically IT issues. Of course there is a difference there. They're also very subjective issues, as opposed to very objective items like firewalls, known malicious bits, behaviors, signatures, ports. Business presents very complex issues that are often involving people (which we can't patch) and that often don't fit nicely into blanket rules. Even if we turned away from technical solutions and devoted our time into solving these problems, they are still not going to be neatly solved. Likewise, when push comes to shove, can you have and meet goals with firewalls? Can you show improvement? All of this flows from the rather subjective non-technical aspect of those issues. Sort of the difference between a child's report card and the feedback you get from a parent-teacher conference. If you have a child, which one would you be most inclined to disagree with or not necessarily believe? (The answer is the subjective one!)<br/><br/>It could be said this is the natural progression of security and technology: from shoring up the technical controls to moving up the stack towards behavior and people. Sure, these 3 top concerns can be said to punch through firewalls and network segments, but that's the nature of those things (social media "punching" through a firewall is far different than me punching through an SSH connection to bridge my home network; social media is akin to the *way* I use my SSH connection after the hold is already punched because it is needed; i.e. social media is the way port 80 is used.)<br/><br/>Basically, all indications point to not being surprised by this dichotomy. And I don't think this is some further indication that IT/security is doing it wrong, or isn't aligned properly with business, or has a technical dark-server-room background. I'm not saying we're doing things right or we're properly aligned, but the above isn't a good argument to support the theory of those deficiencies.<br/><br/>Now for a really big jump. I'd liken the current increase in mobile computing to be as big as the introduction of computers into the business and later the PC/internet into business. Now, I wasn't around when the former happened, nor was I in the industry when the personal computer revolution swept into business, but I would bet that is the closest comparison so far. I may even say the same for social media. These are damned new and they're big changes beyond just bringing in Macs or new software or some new business process. | Zapravo, čak bih išao tako daleko da kažem da se to nikada neće promijeniti, niti bismo se trebali uzbuđivati zbog toga. Za 10 godina, i dalje ćemo imati krvavi rub, složene stavke na popisu najvećih briga, a stvari koje napokon dolazimo do razumijevanja bit će glavni dijelovi naše potrošnje.<br/><br/>Sada, Gunnar i Andy imaju odlične točke, posebno o IT timovima koji vide IT probleme i rješavaju ih s IT rješenjima; u stvari, siguran sam da njihove točke imaju vrijednost.<br/><br/>Ali mislim da postoje i druge ideje koje trumf one (ja sam komentirao na svojim blogovima o tome, a kasnije sam odlučio da bih trebao samo blog ovdje). Ti top 3 zabrinutosti su krvavo novi takvi da:<br/><br/>Bojimo se novih stvari jer ih ne razumijemo, ili ih ne razumijemo jer su nove.<br/><br/>Previše su novi za nas da bismo imali čvrste pristupe njihovom rukovanju.<br/><br/>Previše su novi da bismo znali trebamo li biti zabrinuti ili ne! imamo tendenciju da postanemo paranoični / zabrinuti, što je dobro!<br/><br/>previše novi da imaju očite proračunske stavke dodijeljene njima. Mogu li kupiti kutiju ili neki softver koji pružaju "cloud sigurnost" ili "sigurnost društvenih medija"?<br/><br/>Oni su toliko novi da posao ne zna ni kako ih koristiti ili što žele od njih. Da ne spominjem kako ih možemo osigurati dok još uvijek zadovoljavamo ili barem ne gazimo sve poslovne potrebe. Ako tvrtka još uvijek ne zna kako ih koristiti, nisam siguran da je sigurnost u poziciji da sigurno vodi tu upotrebu.<br/><br/>Također treba napomenuti da se ove nove stvari u velikoj mjeri guraju preko potrošačke zemlje i u posao, s IT-om kao vrstom "O da", misli. Firewall, AV, AM, Auth su svi IT odgovori na tipične IT probleme. Naravno, postoji razlika. Oni su također vrlo subjektivni problemi, za razliku od vrlo objektivnih stavki kao što su vatrozid, poznati zlonamjerni bitovi, ponašanja, potpisi, portovi. Poslovanje predstavlja vrlo složena pitanja koja često uključuju ljude (koje ne možemo popraviti) i koja se često ne uklapaju u opća pravila. Čak i ako smo se okrenuli od tehničkih rješenja i posvetili svoje vrijeme rješavanju tih problema, oni još uvijek neće biti uredno riješeni. Isto tako, kada dođe do guranja, možete li imati i ostvariti ciljeve s vatrozidovima? Možete li pokazati poboljšanje? Sve to proizlazi iz prilično subjektivnog netehničkog aspekta tih pitanja. Neka vrsta razlike između kartice izvješća djeteta i povratnih informacija koje dobivate od konferencije roditelj-nastavnik. Ako imate dijete, s kojim biste se najvjerojatnije složili ili ne nužno vjerovali? (Odgovor je subjektivan!)<br/><br/>Moglo bi se reći da je to prirodni napredak sigurnosti i tehnologije: od jačanja tehničkih kontrola do kretanja prema ponašanju i ljudima. Naravno, ova 3 glavna pitanja mogu se reći da probijaju kroz vatrozid i mrežne segmente, ali to je priroda tih stvari (društveni mediji "probijaju" kroz vatrozid je daleko drugačiji od mene probijanja kroz SSH vezu za most moju kućnu mrežu; Društveni mediji su slični * načinu * Koristim svoju SSH vezu nakon što je zadržavanje već probijeno jer je potrebno; tj.<br/><br/>U osnovi, sve indikacije ukazuju na to da nas ova dihotomija ne iznenađuje. I ne mislim da je to neka daljnja naznaka da IT/sigurnost to radi pogrešno, ili nije pravilno usklađena s poslovanjem, ili ima tehničku pozadinu mračnog poslužitelja. Ne kažem da radimo stvari ispravno ili da smo ispravno usklađeni, ali gore navedeno nije dobar argument za potporu teoriji tih nedostataka.<br/><br/>Sada za stvarno veliki skok. Volio bih da je trenutni porast u mobilnim računalima jednako velik kao i uvođenje računala u posao, a kasnije i računala / internet u posao. Sada, nisam bio u blizini kada se prvi dogodio, niti sam bio u industriji kada je revolucija osobnog računala ušla u posao, ali kladim se da je to najbliža usporedba do sada. Mogu čak reći isto za društvene medije. To su prokleto nove i velike promjene osim što donose Macove ili novi softver ili neki novi poslovni proces. |
