| While acknowledging that it's impossible to argue someone into loving something they hate, and vice versa, it's still often enjoyable to attempt the argument. When we talk to people whose opinions directly contradict ours, we're forced to defend our tastes, define our opinions, and analyze why we react the way we do. Which is why we have Why Don't You Like This?, in which two of our staffers will attempt to discover whether people with opposing opinions can get beyond "No, you're wrong!" and have a civil, constructive, and possibly even convincing discussion about their points of contention. Because no matter what talk radio says, there's still a middle ground between "We agree utterly" and "I'm right, and you're stupid and evil."<br/><br/>Scott: Since discussing my Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World apostasy, we've been looking for a case where I can call you out for not liking something wonderful, and we didn't have to look for long. We were sitting right next to each other during Martin Scorsese's Hugo—me, utterly enchanted by its fantastical tribute to the wonders of early silent cinema, and you, apparently resisting it at every turn. Critical consensus has been on my side: It hit the No. 9 spot on our collective Top 15 (though you listed it as your Overrated choice), has won (or placed) in various film-critic awards, and currently enjoys an 83 score on Metacritic. That doesn't mean you're wrong, of course, but the onus is on you to explain why Hugo was, in your words, "hollow and artificial," where many of us saw it as a lovely evocation of Scorsese's childhood and the medium when it was still in its infancy. And please be gentle as you rip this butterfly apart by the wings.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Tasha: I can't be gentle, Scott. Sometimes it hurts less if you rip the Band-Aid off all at once. (And even if it doesn't, who wants to walk around wearing a half-ripped-off Band-Aid? Gross.) The fact is, I found Hugo to be a wearyingly manipulative exercise in fakery, starting from its opening glide through a Paris train station, which reminded me more than anything of Robert Zemeckis' The Polar Express. Unlike Mike D'Angelo, I'm a fan of long, unbroken takes as a way of establishing a space and encouraging viewers to unconsciously hold their breaths as a camera explores an area; but when the space being explored is a slick, shiny CGI creation, and the camera floats weightlessly through it with no physical sense that either the camera or the surroundings are really there, that exploration starts to feel like watching someone else play a videogame. And the rest of the film felt similarly poreless and unreal to me, both in terms of its setting and in terms of its highly contrived, maudlin story.<br/><br/>I don't necessarily have a problem with manufactured, stylized environments in film. I loved Baz Luhrmann's equally sprawling, utterly artificial take on Paris in Moulin Rouge, for instance, but that film has a sense of its own ridiculousness, a sense of humor about how deliberately over-the-top it is. Ditto the stylization of Jean-Pierre Jeunet, particularly in Amélie. (Both Jeunet and Luhrmann felt like strong visual influences here.) I got the sense, however, that Martin Scorsese wanted me to take Hugo entirely seriously. Even though it's yet another achingly sentimental story about a plucky orphan bringing color back into the life of a grumpy old curmudgeon. And I just couldn't.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>There is nothing I enjoy more in film than being surprised. And there's nothing I resent and resist more than being overtly manipulated, being loudly told what to feel and when to feel it. A good film does this kind of thing subtly; a bad one uses crashing music cues and sweet strings—and in this case, a grubby, huge-eyed, disheveled orphan staring woefully at the camera—to demand pathos, and to tell viewers they're horrible people if they don't serve it up on demand. That said, I can deal with sad kids and grumpy adults making life better for each other—I really dug this year's Le Havre, which was essentially the same plot without all the cutesiness—but I find the artificial environments reflect badly on the artificial emotions, and each makes the other seem more fake by turns.<br/><br/>Let's start with that. In our overlooked films video, you and Noel both took Keith to task for championing Tyrannosaur, because you felt it wasn't realistic enough—too contrived, too miserablist, too much, too far. How is it possible that you can't buy a stymied old crank who breaks things when he's angry, but you can buy an orphan living inside a giant train-station clock and embarking upon a whimsical journey to repair a mysterious automaton that he believes might bear secrets from his dead father, but which instead leads him on a quirky voyage of self-discovery, into the magical land of cinema? Did you never find Hugo's gaudy rococo design, aggressive heartstring-plucking, or wheelbarrow-loads of quirk even a little excessive or hard to swallow?<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Scott: Jeunet and Luhrmann as influences on Scorsese?! Forget being indelicate, now you're deliberately poking me with a sharp stick. If you're looking for inspirations for Hugo—indeed, if you're looking for the emotional core of Hugo—you have to go back to Scorsese's childhood on Elizabeth Street in Little Italy, where an asthmatic little boy, unable to play outside with the other kids, retreated to Alexander Korda fantasies like The Thief Of Bagdad. Or, more simply, just go straight to the source himself: George Méliès, whose A Trip To The Moon remains the Big Bang of all cinematic fantasies, that moment when the camera was not used to document the world as it is, but whatever whimsical, magical, transporting place a filmmaker wants to invent for it. And that tradition has been developed and expanded upon for decades before the likes of Jeunet and Luhrmann got their grubby little paws on it.<br/><br/>And speaking of Jeunet, nice attempt to take away my rhetorical weapon, but I'll say it anyway: How can you love Amélie, yet find Hugo synthetic and "excessive" and "wearyingly manipulative"? You say that Amélie and Moulin Rouge have redeeming "sense of [their] own ridiculousness" where Scorsese means us to take Hugo seriously, and I don't think that's the case, at least on the latter point. That Scorsese feels evident passion about the movies is, I suppose, why you'd interpret Hugo as self-serious. But to me, it's those feelings that give the film an emotional ballast that the Luhrmann and Jeunet films don't have. All three films make aggressive use of the marvels of CGI—and Scorsese adds 3D to the mix, to wonderful effect—but where you and I differ is on the issue of weightlessness. I agree that CGI has a distancing effect; worlds composed entirely of digital plasticine are flexible to the point where they sometimes have no presence. You referred to Hugo in your "Overrated" entry for our Best Of Film piece as "a CGI gimcrack"—a perfect dis… for another movie.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>It's fair to say that Scorsese has built Hugo around a standard-issue, "heartstring-plucking" children's book/movie plot: Orphan misses his daddy, creates his own little fantasy world, gloms onto a new friend, convinces a crusty old fuddy-duddy to soften up and maybe adopt him. But that's just the narrative skeleton, and Scorsese provides plenty of flesh and blood. For one, you can't watch Hugo, the lonely boy, peering out from clock towers to the hustle-and-bustle of a Paris train station without thinking of Scorsese, another lonely boy, staring out of his bedroom window on Elizabeth Street. And even if you're not a big enough film nerd to make that connection, I really feel like Hugo's journey is not in finding a new father figure, but in persisting with the mechanical magic that stands as his own father's legacy. That's what film is: The persistence of vision that allows us to accept an illusory version of the world at 24 frames per second is science and magic at once. Hugo's relationship with Méliès isn't about him cozying up to a new daddy, but sharing a common enthusiasm the old man has submerged in bitterness. To me, that's a far more unique angle on a potentially shopworn premise.<br/><br/>Did you really find none of Hugo enchanting? Even the film's few detractors seem willing to admit that the sequences evoking cinema history and Méliès' studio—with Michael Stuhlbarg as the heroic film scholar!—were terrific. It felt, in the best possible way, like a heady compression of my History Of Film 101 class in college, condensing a semester's worth of clips and context into something between a montage and an animated pop-up book. And it speaks to the ingenious design of the film, which layers fact and fantasy so beautifully that it's at once a history of Méliès and the birth of cinema, and just the sort of simple, sumptuously produced cinematic wonder that Scorsese himself would have loved as a child. Thank goodness Hugo doesn't follow the Jeunet/Luhrmann model and have "a sense of its own ridiculousness." As a fantasy connoisseur yourself, wouldn't you say there's value in playing it straight and earnest and unabashed rather than winking at the audience? You may find Hugo sickly sweet, but I don't think the authenticity of its sentiment is to be denied.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Tasha: Yes, I did in fact find parts of Hugo enchanting. (Notice how I'm answering your question up front, whereas you were too busy frothing with apoplexy to address mine, though I assume that's an answer in its own right. Okay, "influence" may be overstating the case—I just meant the visual style looked very familiar. Though as Keith pointed out when you brought this up in person, Scorsese is neither opposed to drawing inspiration from other people's visuals, nor immune to it.) Primarily, I was enchanted by the parts dealing with Georges Méliès' backstory, with his love of cinema, with the work he put into his art and the joy he got out of it. There's an awful lot of beauty and fun in the staging of the underwater-court scene from Méliès' "Fairyland," and in the sequence at the end, focusing on Méliès footage. I'll grant you that Hugo's connection with Méliès over a shared love of film is a nice touch. And I do enjoy a good film about filmmaking.<br/><br/>But Hugo isn't primarily about film, in spite of the Méliès tie-ins. In addition to the themes you cite, it's also about finding your purpose, as the characters expressly, laboriously explain to each other and to us. And it's about spectacle, and big action setpieces, and chases, and happily-ever-after endings where even the angry bully and the shy older couple and fergawdsakes even the cranky dachshund all get paired off with charming love interests by the end. It's about the super-precocious Hermione Granger-type being bossy and perky and clever and praising the magical worlds encased in books. And all of this business is mighty familiar, and mighty artificial.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Yes, Scorsese is playing with archetypes. Problem is, I never felt he imbued them with anything new, fresh, or believable, in spite of his own backstory. I would have much preferred a story about a young Scorsese growing up with asthma—something small-scale and real, without vast rooms full of CGI clockwork and golden glowing dust-motes and prophetic dreams and a raging adult tyrant-guard with a heart of gold—all of that outsized, over-the-top nonsense. You keep citing Scorsese's personal background and love of film as evidence that he's really feeling what he's putting on the screen, but I don't feel his personal touch in any of this, except the moments that are expressly about film. The core emotions may be real, but that doesn't make the execution less false.<br/><br/>You say the authenticity of the emotion isn't to be denied. I don't question whether Scorsese personally felt lonely and isolated as a child, but I don't feel loneliness and isolation on the screen—I see a bunch of exaggerated signifiers (Hugo is filthy and his clothes are worn and all the adults yell at him and he regularly gets chased by a scary dog!) and big beats, with shouting and weeping and Spielbergian wonder-emoting. For me, sincerity is more convincing and more personal when it's quiet and direct; when someone's shouting his opinions at me, I assume he's either really angry, or just trying to overwhelm my senses to keep me from expressing my own opinion. Hugo was one long shout, as far as I was concerned.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Why didn't I get that sense of fakery from Amélie, you ask? Actually, I did. I'll completely acknowledge that Amélie and Moulin Rouge are both big, manipulative, artificial constructions in the exact same vein, demanding specific emotions at specific intervals, and trying to sell those emotions with heavy emoting and aggressive soundtrack prodding. Neither of them really sold me on their emotions as authentic human feeling. What I enjoyed in those two films was the construction—particularly Amélie's heady, laughable lists of random characterizing features and experiences for its cast, and Moulin Rouge's musical-magpie mashups and recontextualizations. I'm often sold on stories that do creative or ambitious things with structure, and both of those movies qualify, where Hugo is a much more linear, standard kid-quest.<br/><br/>But in the end, for me, it really does come down to a feeling that those movies are goofs, whereas Hugo is meant to be taken seriously at every treacly moment. You don't think that's true—but you're simultaneously defending its integrity in terms of its absolutely authentic, rooted-in-Scorsese's-history emotion, and telling me I'm wrong, and he doesn't mean it to be taken seriously. How do you reconcile those two statements? What about the film suggests to you that it isn't meant to be taken at face value? And is it possible this is just another Curious Case Of Benjamin Button-like situation where I find the use of kids in big-budget films to be largely sappy and melodramatic, whereas you as a dad find it bypasses your cynicism and goes straight to your family-feeling?<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Scott: Not sure I meant that Scorsese doesn't mean to be taken seriously; it's just that he's chosen a whimsical vehicle through which to express a serious love of the movies. When you say, "But Hugo isn't primarily about film, in spite of the Méliès tie-ins," I'm mystified. I grant that you find many elements of Hugo overly familiar and laborious and full of Spielbergian wonder-emoting—there's nothing I can do to argue around that perception, which other Hugo doubters share. Sometimes a film means to charm and enchant, and it doesn't for some; you've got Hugo and I've got Amélie, though I think the latter, deliberately artificial as it is, means for us to find it romantic. (Rather than, say, some horrible mechanical contraption fit for a Saw sequel.)<br/><br/>But to say Hugo isn't primarily about film? If it's not about film, then it's the most pointlessly discursive story about [whatever you think it's about] I've ever seen. The relationship between Hugo and Méliès is the heart of the movie, and at the heart of that is not just some stock connection between Plucky Orphan and Crusty Old Guy With A Heart Of Gold, but a shared affinity for engineered magic—specifically the magic of the movies. I think Scorsese and his collaborators have found a way to express their enthusiasm over the early days of cinema through a fantasy that's accessible to all ages. The archetype-filled children's tale is the merely the crust here; cinema is the pie. (Mmmm… pie.)<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>As for The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button, I don't see much of a connection, other than trying to expose me as a Benjamin Button defender as a way of damaging my credibility. (Incidentally, how are the extras on that G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra Blu-ray?) I've said to you that the sleep-deprived new dad in me was perhaps vulnerable to Benjamin Button, but I can't imagine a time when the premise of aging in reverse wouldn't move me. (Cradling the love of your life in your arms as an infant? How can you not be affected by that?) And besides, I don't see how Benjamin Button relates much to Hugo as a film concerning kids, since that's just a small segment of a story that spans a much larger trajectory.<br/><br/>So have I convinced you? Likely not. But I'm happy to learn that Hugo wasn't entirely devoid of enchantments for you. The sequences on Méliès the filmmaker are what put Hugo over for me—and in that, at least, we can share some movie love.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Tasha: Nope, I can't say you've convinced me, any more than I've convinced you. It's impossible to argue anyone into a visceral love of anything, and it really should be equally impossible to talk someone down from visceral love. Mostly, you've let me see Hugo in Scott-O-Vision, which is an interesting experience; at least now I'm mildly convinced that we didn't somehow manage to see entirely different films which both somehow had the same name and director.<br/><br/>We certainly had different experiences, though, and to my mind, focused on different aspects of the production: I still don't see the "film is marvelous" theme as the movie's single strand, so much as one among too many. "Pointlessly discursive" almost covers it, though I'd throw in "often needlessly cutesy and precious" on top of that. While you're focused on the film's tasty pie filling, I feel like that pie was covered with a pound of crystallized sugar, and I think that does make a difference, regardless of the film's core message or handful of terrific scenes. See also Benjamin Button, which I did not bring up just to chafe you—I really do think you have more of a sentimental streak than I do regarding children in cinema, especially when they're used more as symbols of vulnerability and innocence than as human characters. Hey, you know what film totally does not have cute wide-eyed moppets bringing hope to a cynical world? G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra. Maybe I will go watch those Blu-ray extras. I could use some explosion-insulin to compensate for Hugo's sweetness. | Iako priznajemo da je nemoguće argumentirati nekoga da voli nešto što mrzi, i obrnuto, još uvijek je često ugodno pokušati argument. Kada razgovaramo s ljudima čija su mišljenja izravno u suprotnosti s našima, prisiljeni smo braniti svoje ukuse, definirati svoja mišljenja i analizirati zašto reagiramo na način na koji reagiramo. Zato imamo Why Don't You Like This?, u kojem će dvojica naših zaposlenika pokušati otkriti mogu li ljudi s suprotnim mišljenjima preći preko "Ne, griješite!" i imati građansku, konstruktivnu, a možda čak i uvjerljivu raspravu o svojim argumentima. Jer bez obzira što radio govori, još uvijek postoji sredina između "Slažemo se u potpunosti" i "Ja sam u pravu, a ti si glup i zao."<br/><br/>Scott: Otkad smo raspravljali o mom Scott Pilgrim vs. The World otpadništvu, tražili smo slučaj u kojem vas mogu pozvati jer vam se ne sviđa nešto prekrasno, i nismo morali dugo tražiti. Sjedili smo jedan do drugoga tijekom filma Martina Scorsesea Hugo – mene, potpuno očaranog njegovim fantastičnim odavanjem počast čudima rane nijeme kinematografije, a vas, očito, odupirete mu se na svakom koraku. Kritički konsenzus je bio na mojoj strani: pogodio je 9. mjesto na našem kolektivnom Top 15-u (iako ste ga naveli kao svoj precijenjeni izbor), osvojio je (ili plasirao) na razne nagrade filmskih kritičara, a trenutno uživa u rezultatu od 83 na Metacritic-u. To ne znači da ste u krivu, naravno, ali teret je na vama da objasnite zašto je Hugo bio, po vašim riječima, "šuplji i umjetni", gdje su ga mnogi od nas vidjeli kao lijep prisjećaj Scorseseovog djetinjstva i medija dok je bio još u djetinjstvu. I molim vas budite nježni dok trgate ovog leptira po krilima.<br/><br/>Oglašavanje<br/><br/>Tasha: Ne mogu biti nježna, Scott. Ponekad boli manje ako skineš zavoj odjednom. (A čak i ako ne, tko želi hodati okolo noseći polu-pokidan zavoj? Grozno.) Činjenica je da sam otkrio da je Hugo zamorno manipulativna vježba u krivotvorenju, počevši od svog otvaranja klizanja kroz željezničku stanicu u Parizu, što me više podsjećalo na bilo što od Polar Expressa Roberta Zemeckisa. Za razliku od Mikea D'Angela, ja sam ljubitelj dugog, neprekinutog prostora koji se uzima kao način uspostavljanja prostora i potiče gledatelje da nesvjesno zadrže dah dok kamera istražuje područje; ali kada je prostor koji se istražuje glatka, sjajna CGI kreacija, a kamera pluta bestežinsko kroz njega bez fizičkog osjećaja da je kamera ili okolica stvarno tamo, da se netko počinje gledati video. Ostatak filma osjećao se jednako poreless i nerealno za mene, kako u smislu postave, tako i u smislu njegove vrlo izmišljene, maudlin priče.<br/><br/>Nemam nužno problema s proizvedenim, stiliziranim okruženjima u filmu. Volio sam Baza Luhrmanna jednako rasprostranjen, potpuno umjetni pogled na Pariz u Moulin Rougeu, na primjer, ali taj film ima osjećaj vlastite smiješnosti, smisao za humor o tome kako je namjerno over-the-top je. Do stilizacije Jean-Pierrea Jeuneta, posebice u Amélie. (I Jeunet i Luhrmann su se ovdje osjećali kao jaki vizualni utjecaji.) Dobio sam, međutim, osjećaj da je Martin Scorsese želio da Huga shvatim potpuno ozbiljno. Iako je to još jedna bolno sentimentalna priča o hrabrom siročetu koje vraća boju u život mrzovoljnog starca.<br/><br/>Oglašavanje<br/><br/>Ne postoji ništa što više uživam u filmu nego biti iznenađen. I ne postoji ništa što zamjeram i opirem se više nego biti otvoreno manipuliran, biti glasno rečeno što osjećati i kada to osjećati. Dobar film čini takve stvari suptilno; loš koristi razbijanje glazbenih znakova i slatkih žica - au ovom slučaju, grubo, ogromno očiju, rastrgano siroče koje tužno bulji u kameru - da zahtijeva patos i da kaže gledateljima da su užasni ljudi ako ga ne poslužuju na zahtjev. To je rekao, mogu se nositi s tužnom djecom i mrzovoljnim odraslima koji čine život boljim jedni za druge - stvarno sam iskopao ovogodišnji Le Havre, koji je u suštini bio isti zaplet bez sve slatkoće - ali pronašao sam umjetno okruženje koje se loše odražava na umjetne emocije, a svaki čini da drugi izgledaju lažniji naizmjence.<br/><br/>Počnimo s tim. U našim previdjenim filmskim videozapisima, ti i Noel ste obojica odveli Keitha na zadatak zagovaranja Tiranosaura, jer ste smatrali da to nije dovoljno realistično - previše izmišljeno, previše jadno, previše, previše daleko. Kako je moguće da ne možete kupiti uštogljenu staru polugu koja razbija stvari kad je ljuta, ali možete kupiti siroče koje živi unutar divovskog sata na željezničkoj stanici i kreće na hirovito putovanje kako bi popravio tajanstveni automat za koji vjeruje da može nositi tajne od svog mrtvog oca, ali koji ga umjesto toga vodi na čudno putovanje samootkrivanja, u čarobnu zemlju filma? Zar nikad nisi našao Hugov gaudy rokoko dizajn, agresivne srčane žice, ili kolica puna čudaka, čak i malo pretjerana ili teška za progutati?<br/><br/>Oglašavanje<br/><br/>Scott: Jeunet i Luhrmann kao utjecaji na Scorsesea?! Zaboravite biti bezobzirni, sada me namjerno ubadate oštrim štapom. Ako tražite inspiraciju za Huga – zapravo, ako tražite emocionalnu jezgru Huga – morate se vratiti u Scorseseovo djetinjstvo u Elizabeth Streetu u Maloj Italiji, gdje se astmatični dječak, nesposoban igrati vani s drugom djecom, povukao u fantazije Alexandera Korde poput The Thief Of Bagdad. Ili, jednostavnije, samo idite ravno na sam izvor: George Méliès, čije putovanje na Mjesec ostaje Veliki prasak svih filmskih fantazija, onaj trenutak kada kamera nije korištena za dokumentiranje svijeta kakav jest, već ono hirovito, čarobno, transportno mjesto koje filmaš želi izmisliti za njega. I ta tradicija je razvijena i proširena desetljećima prije nego što su Jeunet i Luhrmann dobili svoje grube male šape na njemu.<br/><br/>Govoreći o Jeunetu, dobar pokušaj da mi oduzme retoričko oružje, ali reći ću to u svakom slučaju: kako možeš voljeti Amelie, a ipak pronaći Huga sintetičkim i "pretjeranim" i "dosadno manipulativnim"? Kažete da Amélie i Moulin Rouge imaju "osjećaj vlastite smiješnosti" gdje Scorsese znači da ozbiljno shvaćamo Huga, a ja ne mislim da je to slučaj, barem u potonjem trenutku. To što Scorsese osjeća očitu strast prema filmovima je, pretpostavljam, razlog zašto biste interpretirali Huga kao samoozbiljnog, ali za mene, upravo ti osjećaji daju filmu emocionalni balast koji filmovi Luhrmann i Jeunet nemaju. Sva tri filma agresivno iskorištavaju čuda CGI-a – a Scorsese dodaje 3D u mješavinu, za prekrasan učinak – ali ono što se ti i ja razlikujemo je pitanje bestežinskog stanja. Slažem se da CGI ima distancirajući učinak; svjetovi sastavljeni u cijelosti od digitalnog plastelina su fleksibilni do točke u kojoj ponekad nemaju prisutnost. Spomenuli ste Huga u svom "Overrated" unosu za naš najbolji filmski komad kao "CGI gimcrack" - savršen dis ... za drugi film.<br/><br/>Oglašavanje<br/><br/>Pošteno je reći da je Scorsese izgradio Huga oko standardnog izdanja dječje knjige / filma: Siroče nedostaje svom tati, stvara svoj mali svijet mašte, uvjerava novog prijatelja, uvjerava hrskavog starca da se omekša i možda ga usvoji. Ali to je samo narativni kostur, a Scorsese daje puno mesa i krvi. Kao prvo, ne možete gledati Huga, usamljenog dječaka, kako bulji od satnih tornjeva do vreve pariškog željezničkog kolodvora, a da ne pomislite na Scorsesea, još jednog usamljenog dječaka, koji bulji kroz prozor svoje spavaće sobe u Elizabeth Streetu. Čak i ako niste dovoljno veliki filmski štreber da uspostavite tu vezu, stvarno osjećam da Hugovo putovanje nije u pronalaženju nove očeve figure, već u upornosti s mehaničkom magijom koja stoji kao nasljeđe njegovog oca. To je ono što je film: Upornost vizije koja nam omogućuje da prihvatimo iluzornu verziju svijeta pri 24 kadra u sekundi je znanost i magija odjednom. Hugov odnos s Mélièsom nije o tome da se on udoban do novog tate, ali dijeleći zajednički entuzijazam stari čovjek je uronjen u gorčinu. Za mene, to je daleko jedinstveniji kut na potencijalno shoppowered premise.<br/><br/>Čak i nekoliko kritičara filma spremni su priznati da su sekvence koje evociraju povijest kinematografije i Mélièsovog studija – s Michaelom Stuhlbargom kao herojskim filmskim znanstvenikom! – bile sjajne. Osjećao se, na najbolji mogući način, kao oštroumno sažimanje mog časa History Of Film 101 na koledžu, kondenziranjem semestra vrijednih isječaka i konteksta u nešto između montaže i animirane pop-up knjige. Govori o genijalnom dizajnu filma, koji tako lijepo prekriva činjenicu i fantaziju da je to odjednom priča o Mélièsu i rođenju kinematografije, i samo vrsta jednostavnog, raskošno proizvedenog kinematografskog čuda koje bi Scorsese volio kao dijete. Hvala Bogu, Hugo ne slijedi Jeunet/Luhrmann model i ima "osjećaj vlastite smiješnosti". Kao poznavatelj fantazije, zar ne biste rekli da je vrijedno igrati ga ravno i ozbiljno i besramno, umjesto namigivanja publici? Možda vam je Hugo bolesno sladak, ali mislim da autentičnost njegovih osjećaja ne treba poricati.<br/><br/>Oglašavanje<br/><br/>Tasha: Da, zapravo sam pronašao dijelove Hugo očaravajuće. (Primjetite kako sam odgovorio na vaše pitanje unaprijed, dok ste bili previše zauzeti pjenjenjem s apopleksijom da biste se obratili mojoj, iako pretpostavljam da je to odgovor sam po sebi. U redu, "utjecaj" može biti prenaglašavanje slučaja - samo sam mislio vizualni stil izgledao vrlo poznato. Iako, kao što je Keith istaknuo kada ste to osobno spomenuli, Scorsese se ne protivi crpljenju inspiracije iz tuđih vizuala, niti je imun na to.) Prije svega, bio sam očaran dijelovima koji se bave pozadinom Georgesa Mélièsa, njegovom ljubavlju prema kinematografiji, radom koji je uložio u svoju umjetnost i radošću koju je iz nje izvukao. Postoji strašno puno ljepote i zabave u postavljanju podvodne scene iz Mélièsove "Zemlje vila", i u nizu na kraju, usredotočujući se na Mélièsove snimke. Priznajem da je Hugova veza s Méliès zbog zajedničke ljubavi prema filmu lijep dodir, a ja uživam u dobrom filmu o snimanju.<br/><br/>Ali Hugo nije prije svega o filmu, unatoč Mélièsovim vezama. Osim tema koje citirate, radi se i o pronalaženju vaše svrhe, kao što likovi izričito, mukotrpno objašnjavaju jedni drugima i nama. I radi se o spektaklu, i velikim akcijskim setpiecesima, i potjerama, i sretno-uvijek-nakon-krajeva gdje čak i ljuti nasilnik i sramežljivi stariji par i fergawdsakes čak i razdražljivi jazavčari sve se upare s šarmantnim ljubavnim interesima do kraja. Radi se o super preuranjenoj Hermioni Granger, koja je nadmoćna i razmetljiva i pametna i hvali čarobne svjetove u knjigama.<br/><br/>Oglašavanje<br/><br/>Da, Scorsese se igra s arhetipovima. Problem je u tome što nikada nisam osjetio da ih je prožimao nečim novim, svježim ili vjerodostojnim, unatoč vlastitoj pozadini. Više bih volio priču o mladom Scorseseu koji odrasta s astmom - nešto malo i stvarno, bez ogromnih soba punih CGI mehaničkih satova i zlatnih sjajnih prašnjavih motora i proročkih snova i bijesnog odraslog tiranina-čuvara sa srcem od zlata - sve te prevelike, prekomjerne gluposti. Stalno navodite Scorseseovu osobnu pozadinu i ljubav prema filmu kao dokaz da on stvarno osjeća ono što stavlja na ekran, ali ja ne osjećam njegov osobni dodir u bilo čemu od toga, osim u trenucima koji su izričito o filmu. Osnovne emocije mogu biti stvarne, ali to ne čini izvršenje manje lažnim.<br/><br/>Kažeš da se autentičnost emocija ne može poreći. Ne dovodim u pitanje je li se Scorsese osobno osjećao usamljeno i izolirano kao dijete, ali ne osjećam usamljenost i izolaciju na ekranu - vidim hrpu pretjeranih značenja (Hugo je prljav i njegova odjeća se nosi i svi odrasli viču na njega i redovito ga juri strašni pas!) i velike otkucaje, s vrištanjem i plačućim Spielbergian. Za mene je iskrenost uvjerljivija i osobnija kada je tiha i izravna; kada netko viče na mene svoje mišljenje, pretpostavljam da je ili stvarno ljut, ili samo pokušava preplaviti moja osjetila kako bi me spriječio da izrazim vlastito mišljenje. Hugo je bio jedan dugi vrisak, što se mene tiče.<br/><br/>Oglašavanje<br/><br/>Zašto nisam dobio taj osjećaj lažiranja od Amelie, pitate? Potpuno ću priznati da su Amélie i Moulin Rouge velike, manipulativne, umjetne konstrukcije u istom duhu, koje zahtijevaju specifične emocije u određenim intervalima, i pokušavaju prodati te emocije s teškim emocionalnim i agresivnim soundtrackom. Nijedan od njih me nije prodao svojim osjećajima kao autentičnim ljudskim osjećajima. Ono što mi se svidjelo u ta dva filma bila je konstrukcija - osobito Amélieine napuhane, smiješne liste slučajnih karakteristika i iskustava za njezinu glumačku postavu, te glazbeno-magpie mashups i recontextualizations Moulin Rougea. Često me prodaju na pričama koje rade kreativne ili ambiciozne stvari sa strukturom, i oba ta filma se kvalificiraju, gdje je Hugo mnogo linearnija, standardna dječja potraga.<br/><br/>Ali na kraju, za mene, to se stvarno svodi na osjećaj da su ti filmovi gluposti, dok je Hugo trebao biti shvaćen ozbiljno u svakom treakly trenutku. Vi ne mislite da je to istina, ali istovremeno branite njegov integritet u smislu njegove apsolutno autentične, ukorijenjene emocije u povijesti Scorsesea i govorite mi da griješim, a on ne znači da to treba shvatiti ozbiljno. A što je s filmom koji vam sugerira da se ne smije uzimati u obzir? I je li moguće da je ovo samo još jedna radoznala situacija poput Benjamina Buttona u kojoj smatram da je korištenje djece u velikim proračunskim filmovima uglavnom siromašno i melodramatično, dok ti kao tata smatraš da to zaobilazi tvoj cinizam i ide ravno u tvoj obiteljski osjećaj?<br/><br/>Oglašavanje<br/><br/>Nisam siguran da sam mislio da Scorsese ne znači biti shvaćen ozbiljno; to je samo da je odabrao hirovito vozilo kroz koje će izraziti ozbiljnu ljubav prema filmovima. Kada kažete, "Ali Hugo nije prvenstveno o filmu, unatoč Mélièsovim vezama," ja sam zbunjen. Priznajem da smatrate da su mnogi elementi Huga previše poznati i naporni i puni Spielbergovih čudesnih emocija - ne mogu ništa učiniti da se raspravlja o toj percepciji, koju dijele drugi sumnjači u Huga. Ponekad film znači šarmirati i očarati, a nekima to ne znači; imate Huga i imam Amélie, iako mislim da potonji, namjerno umjetni, znači da ga smatramo romantičnim. (Umjesto, recimo, neke strašne mehaničke izmišljotine pogodne za nastavak Pile.)<br/><br/>Ali reći da Hugo nije prvenstveno o filmu? Ako nije o filmu, onda je to najbesmislenija diskurzivna priča o [o čemu god da mislite da je] koju sam ikada vidio. Odnos između Huga i Mélièsa je srce filma, a u središtu toga nije samo neka stock veza između Plucky Orphan i Crusty Old Guy s srcem od zlata, već zajednički afinitet za inženjersku magiju - posebno čaroliju filmova. Mislim da su Scorsese i njegovi suradnici pronašli način da izraze svoj entuzijazam tijekom ranih dana kinematografije kroz fantaziju koja je dostupna svim uzrastima. Dječja priča ispunjena arhetipom je samo kora ovdje; kino je pita. (Mmmm... stopalo.)<br/><br/>Oglašavanje<br/><br/>Što se tiče čudnog slučaja Benjamina Buttona, ne vidim mnogo veze, osim što me pokušava izložiti kao branitelja Benjamina Buttona kao način da oštetim svoj kredibilitet. (Usput, kako su statisti na tom G.I. Joe: Uspon Cobra Blu-ray?) Rekao sam ti da je novi tata u meni koji je lišen sna možda bio ranjiv na Benjamina Buttona, ali ne mogu zamisliti vrijeme kada me pretpostavka starenja u suprotnom ne bi pomaknula. Kako to ne može utjecati na vas?) Osim toga, ne vidim kako se Benjamin Button puno odnosi na Huga kao film o djeci, budući da je to samo mali dio priče koji se proteže puno većom putanjom.<br/><br/>Jesam li vas uvjerio? Vjerojatno ne. Ali drago mi je saznati da Hugo nije bio potpuno lišen čarolija za vas. Slike na Méliès filmaš su ono što je stavio Hugo preko za mene - i u tome, barem, možemo podijeliti neke filmske ljubavi.<br/><br/>Oglašavanje<br/><br/>Tasha: Ne, ne mogu reći da si me uvjerio, više nego što sam uvjerio tebe. Nemoguće je raspravljati bilo koga u visceralnoj ljubavi prema bilo čemu, i stvarno bi trebalo biti jednako nemoguće razgovarati nekoga iz visceralne ljubavi. Uglavnom, dopustili ste mi da vidim Huga u Scott-O-Vision, što je zanimljivo iskustvo; barem sam sada blago uvjeren da nismo nekako uspjeli vidjeti potpuno različite filmove koji su na neki način imali isto ime i redatelja.<br/><br/>Svakako smo imali različita iskustva i, po mom mišljenju, usredotočili smo se na različite aspekte produkcije: još uvijek ne vidim temu "film je čudesan" kao jedan niz filma, koliko i jedan od previše. "Besmisleno diskurzivno" ga gotovo pokriva, iako bih bacio na "često nepotrebno slatko i dragocjeno" na vrhu toga. Dok ste usredotočeni na ukusno punjenje pite filma, osjećam se kao da je ta pita bila prekrivena funtom kristaliziranog šećera, i mislim da to čini razliku, bez obzira na osnovnu poruku filma ili šačicu sjajnih scena. Vidi također Benjamin Button, kojeg nisam spomenuo samo da bih vas iskasapio – stvarno mislim da imate više sentimentalnog niza nego što ja imam u vezi s djecom u kinu, pogotovo kada se više koriste kao simboli ranjivosti i nevinosti nego kao ljudski likovi. Hej, znate koji film uopće nema slatke širokooke lutke koje donose nadu ciničnom svijetu? G.I. Joe: Uspon Kobre. Možda ću ići gledati one Blu-ray dodatke. Mogao bih koristiti neki eksplozivni inzulin da nadoknadim Hugovu slatkoću. |
| "I hoped my daughter would be free from difficult and troubling times": Mee Mee's story as a refugee Mom<br/><br/>Hope in Times of Crisis: A Mother's Day Story<br/><br/>By Judith Santiago*<br/><br/>Mee Mee heard that the soldiers were coming. She took hold of her son and frantically joined the rest of the villagers who were running toward the Thai-Burmese border, where the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) was located. Her husband was in another village running in the opposite direction, Mee later learned. After the soldiers' pursuit ended, Mee returned home to her small village in Koechi, Burma.<br/><br/>During 1997-2000, Mee and thousands like her lived under the constant threat of violence from Burmese soldiers. Many people would take temporary refuge in the jungle, and return home to their village after soldiers left the area, just to do it all over again days later. About once a week, Mee and others would be on the move to avoid capture, rape, or death by soldiers.<br/><br/>During one incident, Mee's husband ran ahead of his wife to secure food for his family. Her husband was spotted by soldiers and shot. The bullet shattered a portion of his ribcage, leaving him severely wounded and in distress as he journeyed toward the jungle with his family for safety.<br/><br/>For three months, Mee's husband hid and moved the family with an exasperating wound at his side. He received no medical care, except for Mee's tending.<br/><br/>"I was afraid to return to Burma," Mee said through an interpreter. "I feared dying. I cried and cried every day," she continued.<br/><br/>Mee's husband eventually drew enough strength to walk five days toward a small village in Thailand where they learned the location of a hospital and a refugee camp. When Mee and her husband finally arrived at the hospital, he underwent immediate surgery and later recovered.<br/><br/>Symbol of Hope<br/><br/>Life in the jungle for those fleeing Burmese soldiers was indeed terrifying and difficult. Makeshift bamboo tents with only roof and floor coverings became suitable temporary dwellings. Many women including Mee gave birth to children in the jungle. Mee's then six-year-old son assisted in the delivery of his sister named Eh Ku Hser. Her name means love – cold – sweet. "Cold" in Burmese culture means so as to not pass through the fire of life, as heat represents troubled times.<br/><br/>"I hoped my daughter would be free from difficult and troubling times," said Mee. "I did not want her to go through what I had experienced," she continued.<br/><br/>For Mee, the birth of her daughter in the midst of darkness, torment and fear, was a symbol of hope for a new life to come. Hope in times of crisis, the very premise of the United Methodist Committee on Relief's (UMCOR) newly co-branded UMCOR-Prosperity Candle, is also the essence of that which candles shed light upon.<br/><br/>A New Beginning<br/><br/>With the help of UNHCR, hope for a new life did indeed materialize for Mee and her family when they resettled in West Springfield, Massachusetts. There, Mee met Moo Kho Paw, another woman who emigrated from Burma, and who was working at Prosperity Candle in Florence. The organization helps refugee women who have escaped areas of conflict rebuild their lives through the art of candle making. Moo Kho recommended that Mee join the organization, and Mee gladly accepted.<br/><br/>"I was excited to be out of the house," said Mee, "I was raised to believe that because I was a woman, my role was to remain at home and raise my family," she continued. "While many Burmese women want to do more for themselves, they are often encouraged to remain homemakers."<br/><br/>Today, Mee has plans to go into the candle-making business for herself and support her five children, but she expressed the need to learn English first.<br/><br/>"In the Thai refugee camp, we had education, but it was not so good," said Mee. "When I was a child, I wanted to go to school, but I was told to stay home because I was a woman. Now, I have hopes for my daughters to go to college and become doctors or policewomen," continued Mee.<br/><br/>Mee has struck an even balance in her life that she wishes others would have found—a simple, happy life where work, caring for family members and freedom of choice all have their place.<br/><br/>Support Refugee Women in the US<br/><br/>Share this Mother's Day story with your loved ones. And, when you purchase handmade candles by Mee, Moo Kho, and Naw, another Burmese refugee woman working at Prosperity Candle , know you are helping to support their livelihood as they rebuild their lives and those of their family members in the US. | "Nadala sam se da će moja kći biti slobodna od teških i uznemirujućih vremena": priča Mee Mee kao izbjeglice mama<br/><br/>Nada u kriznim vremenima: Priča o majčinom danu<br/><br/>Od Judith Santiago*<br/><br/>Mee Mee je čula da vojnici dolaze. Zgrabila je sina i pridružila se ostatku seljaka koji su trčali prema tajlandsko-burmanskoj granici, gdje se nalazio Ured Visokog povjerenika Ujedinjenih naroda za izbjeglice (UNHCR). Nakon što je potjera vojnika završila, Mee se vratila kući u svoje malo selo u Koechiju u Burmi.<br/><br/>Tijekom 1997-2000, Mee i tisuće poput nje živjele su pod stalnom prijetnjom nasilja od strane burmanskih vojnika. Mnogi bi se ljudi privremeno sklonili u džunglu i vratili kući u svoje selo nakon što su vojnici napustili područje, samo da bi to učinili nekoliko dana kasnije. Otprilike jednom tjedno, Mee i drugi bi bili u pokretu kako bi izbjegli zarobljavanje, silovanje ili smrt od strane vojnika.<br/><br/>Tijekom jednog incidenta, Meein muž je trčao ispred svoje žene kako bi osigurao hranu za svoju obitelj. Metak je razbio dio njegovog rebara, ostavljajući ga teško ranjenog i u nevolji dok je putovao prema džungli sa svojom obitelji radi sigurnosti.<br/><br/>Tri mjeseca, Meein muž se skrivao i premještao obitelj s uznemirujućom ranom na svojoj strani. Nije primio nikakvu medicinsku pomoć, osim Meeine njege.<br/><br/>"Bojala sam se vratiti u Burmu", rekla je Mee preko prevoditelja. "Bojala sam se umiranja. Plakala sam i plakala svaki dan", nastavila je.<br/><br/>Meein suprug je na kraju skupio dovoljno snage da pet dana hoda prema malom selu na Tajlandu gdje su saznali lokaciju bolnice i izbjegličkog kampa. Kada su Mee i njezin suprug konačno stigli u bolnicu, podvrgnut je hitnoj operaciji i kasnije se oporavio.<br/><br/>Simbol nade<br/><br/>Život u džungli za one koji su bježali od burmanskih vojnika bio je zaista zastrašujući i težak. Proizvedeni šatori od bambusa sa samo krovnim i podnim pokrivačima postali su prikladni privremeni stanovi. Mnoge žene, uključujući Mee, rodile su djecu u džungli. Mee je tada šestogodišnji sin pomagao u porodu svoje sestre po imenu Eh Ku Hser. Njeno ime znači ljubav - hladno - slatko. "Hladno" u burmanskoj kulturi znači da ne prolazi kroz vatru života, jer vrućina predstavlja problematična vremena.<br/><br/>"Nadala sam se da će moja kći biti oslobođena teških i uznemirujućih vremena", rekla je Mee. "Nisam htjela da prođe kroz ono što sam ja doživjela", nastavila je.<br/><br/>Za Mee, rođenje njezine kćeri usred tame, muke i straha, bio je simbol nade za novi život koji dolazi. Nada u kriznim vremenima, sama pretpostavka UMCOR-a (Ujedinjenog metodističkog odbora za pomoć) novonazvane UMCOR-Prosperity Candle, također je bit onoga na što svijeće bacaju svjetlo.<br/><br/>Novi početak<br/><br/>Uz pomoć UNHCR-a, nada za novi život doista se ostvarila za Mee i njezinu obitelj kada su se preselili u West Springfield, Massachusetts. Tamo je Mee upoznala Moo Kho Paw, drugu ženu koja je emigrirala iz Burme i koja je radila u Prosperity Candle u Firenci. Organizacija pomaže izbjeglicama koje su pobjegle iz područja sukoba da obnove svoje živote kroz umjetnost izrade svijeća. Moo Kho je preporučio da se Mee pridruži organizaciji, a Mee je rado prihvatio.<br/><br/>"Bila sam uzbuđena što sam izvan kuće", rekla je Mee, "odgojena sam da vjerujem da je, budući da sam žena, moja uloga bila ostati kod kuće i odgajati svoju obitelj", nastavila je. "Iako mnoge žene u Burmi žele učiniti više za sebe, često ih se ohrabruje da ostanu domaćice."<br/><br/>Danas Mee planira ući u posao izrade svijeća za sebe i izdržavati svoje petero djece, ali je izrazila potrebu da prvo nauči engleski jezik.<br/><br/>"U tajlandskom izbjegličkom kampu imali smo obrazovanje, ali nije bilo tako dobro", rekla je Mee. "Kad sam bila dijete, željela sam ići u školu, ali mi je rečeno da ostanem kod kuće jer sam žena. Sada se nadam da će moje kćeri ići na fakultet i postati liječnice ili policajke", nastavila je Mee.<br/><br/>Mee je pronašla ravnotežu u svom životu koju bi željela da su drugi pronašli - jednostavan, sretan život u kojem posao, briga za članove obitelji i sloboda izbora imaju svoje mjesto.<br/><br/>Podrška izbjeglicama u SAD-u<br/><br/>Podijelite ovu priču o Majčinom danu sa svojim najmilijima. A kada kupite ručno izrađene svijeće od Mee, Moo Kho i Naw, još jedne burmanske izbjeglice koja radi u Prosperity Candle, znajte da pomažete u podupiranju njihovog života dok obnavljaju svoje živote i živote svojih članova obitelji u SAD-u. |
| The Precedency Essay<br/><br/>1562 words - 7 pages<br/><br/>Affirmative action is a government policy that gives opportunities to minorities, women, and any group who has been the victim of discrimination in the past. Affirmative action is the outcome of the 1960's Civil Rights movement, growing out of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 which outlawed discrimination based on race, ethnicity, or gender. It was the 1978 Supreme Court decision, The Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, which allowed for the use of race-based preferences as a means of fostering diversity, allowing affirmative action to be used in admissions policies. It was created with the intention to provide equal opportunities for members of minority groups in education and ...view middle of the document...<br/><br/>However, according to a 2007 report by the Pew Research Center, support for affirmative action among the American public has actually increased substantiallyin recent years, climbing from 58% in 1995 to 70% in 2007. Supporters of affirmative action make many arguments in support of affirmative action, in the hopes of getting others to see the genuine good that affirmative actin policies bring to our society. Supporters believe that affirmative action is more of a process rather than an admissions policy. Colleges and universities take the extra initiative to reach out to minority groups, encouraging them to apply. Colleges and universities offer additional financial aid and provide on-campus resources to help better the student's college education. Supporters also note the rising number of minority applications to colleges and universities due in part to affirmative action policies.<br/>Statistics have proven that when affirmative action is eliminated, such as when it was at Berkley College and UCLA in 1998, the minority student admissions fell 61 percent and 36 percent respectively, proving that affirmative action plays a major role in a minority students college admissions process. Affirmative action supporters also believe that diversity in higher education provides a better educational atmosphere for all students, personally and intellectually. If affirmative action were to be eliminated, there would be fewer minority students enrolled in colleges, causing diversity to be fairly slim. Affirmative action policies are also necessary in order to compensate for centuries of racial, economic, and social oppression. Individuals with a higher socioeconomic status have more opportunities than those of lower socioeconomic backgrounds. Supporters believe that certain racial or ethnic groups are disadvantaged because they are frequently in lower income households and consequently are not exposed to the same resources as students from higher socioeconomic classes. Advocates support the notion of competition between students based on merit, but argue that affirmative action compensates for economic differences. College graduates, who have benefitted from affirmative action, have also said that they received better jobs, earned more money, and overall live better lives because of the fortunate opportunities they received through affirmative action.<br/>Supporters of affirmative action continuously stress the severe importance of affirmative action, considering its contributions to enhancing both the college experience and society in general. However, opponents of affirmative action believe that the time has come to end affirmative action. Opponents believe affirmative action was created to ensure fair admission practices to bring change to a long period of racial discrimination. They believe the policy is outdated."It's time to pull the plug on race-based decision making," says Ward Connerly, a Sacramento, California businessman and lead organizer of...<br/><br/>Find Another Essay On The Precedency<br/><br/>754 words - 4 pages<br/>of the burden to continue prospering.

Afirmativna akcija je rezultat pokreta za građanska prava 1960-ih, koji je izrastao iz Zakona o građanskim pravima iz 1964. godine koji je zabranio diskriminaciju na temelju rase, etničke pripadnosti ili spola. To je bila odluka Vrhovnog suda iz 1978. godine, The Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, koja je omogućila korištenje rasnih preferencija kao sredstva za poticanje raznolikosti, dopuštajući da se afirmativna akcija koristi u politikama prijema. Nastao je s namjerom da se pripadnicima manjinskih skupina osiguraju jednake mogućnosti u obrazovanju i obrazovanju te da se...pogledajte sredinu dokumenta...<br/><br/>Međutim, prema izvješću Pew Research Centera iz 2007. godine, podrška za afirmativne akcije među američkom javnošću zapravo se znatno povećala u posljednjim godinama, s 58% u 1995. godini na 70% u 2007. godini. Zagovornici afirmativne akcije iznose mnoge argumente u prilog afirmativnoj akciji, u nadi da će drugi vidjeti istinsko dobro koje afirmativna akcijska politika donosi našem društvu. Zagovornici vjeruju da je afirmativna akcija više proces nego politika prijema. Koledži i sveučilišta poduzimaju dodatnu inicijativu kako bi doprli do manjinskih skupina, potičući ih da se prijave. Fakulteti i sveučilišta nude dodatnu financijsku pomoć i osiguravaju resurse na kampusu kako bi pomogli studentu u boljem obrazovanju na fakultetu. Pobornici također primjećuju rastući broj manjinskih prijava na fakultete i sveučilišta, djelomično zbog politike afirmativnih akcija.<br/>Statistike su pokazale da kada se afirmativna akcija eliminira, kao što je to bilo na Berkley Collegeu i UCLA-u 1998. godine, manjinski studentski prijem pao je za 61 posto odnosno 36 posto, što dokazuje da afirmativna akcija igra veliku ulogu u procesu upisa manjinskih studenata na fakultet. Zagovornici afirmativne akcije također vjeruju da raznolikost u visokom obrazovanju pruža bolju obrazovnu atmosferu za sve studente, osobno i intelektualno. Kada bi se ukinule afirmativne akcije, na fakultetima bi se upisalo manje manjinskih studenata, zbog čega bi raznolikost bila prilično tanka. Politike afirmativnog djelovanja također su potrebne kako bi se nadoknadili stoljećima rasnog, ekonomskog i društvenog ugnjetavanja. Pojedinci s višim socioekonomskim statusom imaju više mogućnosti od onih nižih socioekonomskih pozadina. Pristaše smatraju da su određene rasne ili etničke skupine u nepovoljnom položaju jer se često nalaze u kućanstvima s nižim dohotkom i stoga nisu izložene istim resursima kao studenti iz viših socioekonomskih razreda. Zagovornici podupiru pojam natjecanja između studenata na temelju zasluga, ali tvrde da afirmativno djelovanje nadoknađuje ekonomske razlike. Diplomci, koji su imali koristi od afirmativne akcije, također su rekli da su dobili bolje poslove, zaradili više novca i općenito žive bolje živote zbog sretnih prilika koje su dobili putem afirmativne akcije.<br/>Pobornici afirmativne akcije kontinuirano naglašavaju iznimnu važnost afirmativne akcije, s obzirom na njezin doprinos unapređenju iskustva kolegija i društva općenito. Međutim, protivnici afirmativne akcije vjeruju da je došlo vrijeme da se okonča afirmativna akcija. Protivnici vjeruju da je afirmativna akcija stvorena kako bi se osigurala pravedna praksa prijema kako bi se promijenilo dugo razdoblje rasne diskriminacije. Oni vjeruju da je politika zastarjela. "Vrijeme je da povučemo čep za donošenje odluka na temelju rase", kaže Ward Connerly, Sacramento, kalifornijski poslovni čovjek i vodeći organizator...<br/><br/>Nađite još jedan esej o predrasudama<br/><br/>Iako je Jackson stvorio i potpisao sve za indijski Zakon o uklanjanju, zakon neće stupiti na snagu sve do Jacksonovog prethodnika.<br/>Ideja o nacionalnoj banci bila je novi prijedlog u američkom 1800-ih.

Ona piše: "Neka Grci budu Grci, a žene ono što jesu / muškarci imaju prednost i još uvijek se ističu ... nadmoć u svemu i svaka je vaša..." (36-41). Za Bradstreet, tema prkosa je prihvatljiva kada je riječ o kritiziranju fizičkog govora protiv stvarnosti svakodnevnog života - ali nije prihvatljivo primijeniti se na duhovno.

Gledatelji na našim 15 postajama za gledanje na kampusu uživali su u pristupu stručnjacima za pomrčinu i drugim obrazovnim mogućnostima dok su sigurno uživali u pomrčini Sunca. |
| Birthdays<br/><br/>Some people in your organisation may not wish to give you their birth date. Infoodle allows you to remove the birth year of a person! To do this:<br/><br/>When Adding a Person click the Hide Year button to remove the year of birth for the person.<br/><br/>Alternatively, when Editing a Person find the date of birth field for your site. Click the Edit button, then click Hide Year and save.<br/><br/>Easy as that!<br/><br/>Note: A person who has their birth year removed won't appear in any reports regarding an age criteria and is classed as an adult because their date of birth is actually set to 1902! The date of birth field is normally found in the information section but may have been<br/>moved under a different tab by your administrator. | Rođendani<br/><br/>Neki ljudi u vašoj organizaciji možda vam ne žele dati datum rođenja. Infoodle vam omogućuje uklanjanje godine rođenja osobe! Da biste to učinili:<br/><br/>Prilikom dodavanja osobe kliknite gumb Sakrij godinu da biste uklonili godinu rođenja osobe.<br/><br/>Alternativno, prilikom uređivanja osobe pronađite polje datuma rođenja za vaše web-mjesto. Kliknite gumb Uređivanje, a zatim kliknite Sakrij godinu i spremite.<br/><br/>Lagano kao što je to!<br/><br/>Napomena: Osoba kojoj je uklonjena godina rođenja neće se pojaviti u bilo kojim izvještajima u vezi s dobnim kriterijima i klasificirana je kao odrasla osoba jer je njihov datum rođenja zapravo postavljen na 1902. godinu! Datum rođenja obično se nalazi u informativnom odjeljku, ali ga je administrator možda premjestio pod drugom karticom. |
| Combinations<br/><br/>Combinations Are defenses against a punch, choreographed responses to different types of attacks. They have many names across the martial arts but (in my experience) every art has a version of them. This makes them different than forms because there are plenty of martial arts that have no forms. What makes there partner exercises so universal? Why practice a specific response when (in reality) timing, type of attack, size of the attacker, and a hundred other factors will make it so you never use that entire choreographed response? And finally, how can we practice for a real defense situation and avoid injury at the same time?<br/><br/>The universality of combinations is impressive, to say the least. Our style of Kenpo karate has a list of 108 combos that can be learned. (Most students only learn 20-30 though) In Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu you spend whole classes practicing arm bars and chokes, learning every subtlety to the move while your partner offers little to no resistance. Every boxer has spent hours in front of the bag and/or mirror throwing the same combination of punches until their body moves by reflex alone. Combinations are universal because we have no better way to introduce movement and then practice the subtle positions required to make them work. Hitting a small pressure point through clothing takes A LOT of practice, catching an arm bar with control requires a carefully placed hip and a sneaky setup, and a great combination is only useful if you can through it from a balanced and protected position. Can you think of a better way to gain these skills?<br/><br/>There is any number of factors that determine how you respond to an attack and whether in a sparring match or in a fight, I have NEVER used a full combination in my defense. Why, then, do we spend hours practicing them? We practice these choreographed responses because the objective is not to pull combination 8 out every time you see a hook punch but to show you one way of blocking it and then a possible way to follow it up. I have never chosen to use combination 3 in a reality situation but the block is one of my go-to moves. Combinations add tools to the toolbox they do not fix the car.<br/><br/>The last question is a question of safety. If we practice for the sake of reality we need to replicate reality. How do we prevent injury while doing so? When it comes down to it, it's about building trust. We start slow and learn to trust that we have control over ourselves. We learn to trust our partners have control as well. In more time we learn to trust our control over our partner and (a little scarier) we learn to trust our partner's control over us. In the end (with a lot of practice) you can move are full speed, tossing your partner, and being thrown without fear of injury.<br/><br/>Combinations are universal for a reason; they are practiced so they can be dissected into their parts, and we stay safe by starting slow and building trust. As with everything else in the martial arts, combinations have many reasons behind their practice and execution. | Kombinacije<br/><br/>Kombinacije su obrana od udarca, koreografski odgovori na različite vrste napada. Imaju mnogo imena u borilačkim vještinama, ali (po mom iskustvu) svaka umjetnost ima njihovu verziju. To ih čini drugačijim od oblika jer postoji mnogo borilačkih vještina koje nemaju oblike. Što čini partnerske vježbe tako univerzalnim? Zašto vježbati određeni odgovor kada će (u stvarnosti) vrijeme, vrsta napada, veličina napadača i stotinu drugih čimbenika to učiniti tako da nikada ne koristite cijeli koreografski odgovor? I na kraju, kako možemo vježbati za stvarnu obrambenu situaciju i izbjeći ozljede u isto vrijeme?<br/><br/>Univerzalnost kombinacija je impresivna, u najmanju ruku. Naš stil Kenpo karatea ima popis od 108 kombinacija koje se mogu naučiti. (Većina učenika uči samo 20-30) U brazilskom Jiu-Jitsuu provodite cijele klase vježbajući šipke za ruke i gušenja, učeći svaku suptilnost u pokretu dok vaš partner nudi malo ili nimalo otpora. Svaki boksač proveo je sate ispred torbe i / ili ogledala bacajući istu kombinaciju udaraca dok se njegovo tijelo ne pokrene samo refleksom. Kombinacije su univerzalne jer nemamo bolji način za uvođenje pokreta, a zatim vježbanje suptilnih položaja potrebnih za njihov rad. Udaranje male točke pritiska kroz odjeću zahtijeva puno prakse, hvatanje šake s kontrolom zahtijeva pažljivo postavljen kuk i podmuklo postavljanje, a odlična kombinacija je korisna samo ako je možete proći iz uravnoteženog i zaštićenog položaja. Možete li smisliti bolji način za stjecanje tih vještina?<br/><br/>Postoji niz čimbenika koji određuju kako reagirate na napad i da li u sparing utakmici ili u borbi NIKADA nisam koristio punu kombinaciju u svoju obranu. Zašto onda provodimo sate vježbajući ih? Prakticiramo ove koreografske odgovore jer cilj nije izvući kombinaciju 8 svaki put kada vidite udarac kukom, već vam pokazati jedan način da ga blokirate, a zatim mogući način da ga pratite. Nikad nisam odlučio koristiti kombinaciju 3 u stvarnosti situaciji, ali blok je jedan od mojih go-to poteza. Kombinacije dodati alate u kutiju s alatima oni ne popraviti automobil.<br/><br/>Posljednje pitanje je pitanje sigurnosti. Ako vježbamo radi stvarnosti, moramo replicirati stvarnost. Kako spriječiti ozljede dok to činimo? Kada se radi o tome, radi se o izgradnji povjerenja. Počinjemo polako i učimo vjerovati da imamo kontrolu nad sobom. Naučimo vjerovati da i naši partneri imaju kontrolu. U više vremena naučimo vjerovati našoj kontroli nad našim partnerom i (malo zastrašujuće) naučimo vjerovati partnerovoj kontroli nad nama. Na kraju (s puno prakse) možete se kretati punom brzinom, bacanjem partnera i bacanjem bez straha od ozljede.<br/><br/>Kombinacije su univerzalne s razlogom; prakticiraju se tako da se mogu secirati na svoje dijelove, a mi ostajemo sigurni počevši polako i gradeći povjerenje. Kao i sve ostalo u borilačkim vještinama, kombinacije imaju mnogo razloga za svoju praksu i izvršenje. |
