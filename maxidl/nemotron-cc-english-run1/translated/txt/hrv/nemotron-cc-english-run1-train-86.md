| Leclaire<br/><br/>The historic Leclaire neighborhood, once referred to as Edwardsville's "suburb to the south," was founded as a cooperative community in 1890 and remained a separate village until annexed to the city of Edwardsville in 1934. Newspapers and magazines throughout the United States and Europe reported on the Leclaire experiment, particularly during the first 20 years of its existence. In 1979, due to its unique history, the former village was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.<br/><br/>Leclaire was founded by Nelson Oliver Nelson, a St. Louis plumbing manufacturer who, for many years, sought to advance the plight of the working class. Nelson wanted to improve working conditions for his employees and provide housing near the factories so workers and their families could easily participate in recreational and educational programs offered free of charge by the company. Prior to 1890, while still in St. Louis, the N. O. Nelson Company's manufacturing and distribution businesses began providing profit sharing along with educational and recreational opportunities. The Leclaire cooperative experiment would bring additional benefits.<br/><br/>When Nelson employees indicated they wanted to relocate to a rural location, company representatives approached leaders of small towns in several Missouri and Illinois communities near their St. Louis headquarters. They were looking for a suitable property to build new factories and a model village. South of Edwardsville they found a 125-acre tract of land with access to water, coal, and transportation. Local businessmen acted quickly to offer a financial incentive. In less than three weeks, the community raised a fund of $20,000 from individual contributions of between $1 and $1,000 to entice Nelson to choose Edwardsville for his enterprise.<br/><br/>City leaders had hoped to locate property inside the city limits of Edwardsville, but when no suitable site could be found, they were confident that the Nelson investment south of town would soon become a part of Edwardsville. Although Nelson fulfilled all the contingencies for construction and job creation in his contract, it would be 44 years before annexation to Edwardsville. Leclaire, bounded by Madison/Brown Avenues to the east, the railroad tracks to the west, Hadley/McKinley Avenues on the south and Wolf Street to the north, remained an independent village from 1890 to 1934. During that time it earned a reputation for innovations in business, education and residential planning.<br/><br/>The village of Leclaire on a 1931 map of Edwardsville<br/>Courtesy of Paul Jenkins<br/><br/>Nelson's decision to build a village was not made on a whim. By the late 1880s he was an international leader in the fields of cooperation and profit-sharing, exchanging social theories with others around the world while expanding his St. Louis business. He named his experimental village after the Parisian profit-sharer, Edme Jean Leclaire, but he visited many other social visionaries who provided information and inspiration. Compiling the best ideas from these examples, Nelson founded Leclaire to, in his words, "give work, promote intelligence, provide recreation, foster beauty, and make homes." These were all factors he determined necessary for men to lead fulfilling lives. Later writers used these words to formulate Leclaire's founding principles: Work, Homes, Education, Recreation, and Beauty, but with the additional important principle of Freedom.<br/><br/>Work<br/><br/>Work could be considered the most important of these factors since without the factory jobs in Leclaire, there would be no village. The brick factory buildings were designed by architect E. A. Cameron to provide natural light, ventilation in the summer, and heated floors in the winter. There was a fire suppression system and, although industrial accidents were not eliminated, every effort was made to guarantee the safety of the workers. The ivy-covered brick buildings were surrounded by well-manicured lawns and flower gardens giving the complex a campus-like appearance. In 1894, New York World reporter Nellie Bly called the buildings "the ideal perfection of buildings for man to labor in".<br/><br/>The manufacturing complex of the N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company in Leclaire<br/>From Friends of Leclaire<br/><br/>Nelson company policies were designed to protect the financial stability of employees. Workers could earn a share of the profits and have a voice in the company if they chose that option. The profit-sharing plan gave Nelson employees a pride of ownership that resulted in a supportive workforce. There were a few short-lived labor strikes over the years, but for the most part, labor problems were rare. Workers also had reasonable hours and competitive wages. There was a provident fund that provided for pensions and sick leave, as well as widow pensions if a worker died, whether or not the death was related to his employment.<br/><br/>Company headquarters for the N. O. Nelson Company (NONCO) remained in St. Louis, but all of the N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company was moved to Leclaire. The manufacturing company was divided into shops that made a variety of products. In 1900, the shops became independent companies for tax purposes, but all were still owned by the N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company. The shops included the Cabinet Mill where wood products from cabinetry to millwork were produced. The skilled craftsmen that worked here also fulfilled special contracts, including teller cages for a local bank and an altar still in use at St. Andrew's Episcopal Church in Edwardsville. The Marble Shop specialized in architectural marble that was cut and installed by Nelson crews in homes, businesses, and even state capitols throughout the Midwest. The Machine Shop, which became Bignall and Keeler, made pipe fitting machines, pumps, gauges, and various mechanical tools expected in the plumbing trade. They also branched out to manufacture specialty items like the Leclaire Bicycle in the mid-1890s. The Brass Shop included a foundry where various plumbing pipes and tools were manufactured. These examples represent just some of the work done in the Leclaire factories. The company's logo was a stylized "NONCO" that can still be seen on plumbing fixtures and some fire hydrants in Edwardsville today.<br/><br/>Homes<br/><br/>Before homes could be built, housing was needed for workers who were completing the factory buildings as well as building homes. To meet those needs, the company built the "Club House," a large building that served many purposes. In addition to lodging, it was the community's first educational building, and it contained a well-stocked library.<br/><br/>Construction of the residential portion of Leclaire began immediately after the village was founded in June of 1890. Julius Pitzman, the innovative landscape architect who laid out the first lots in Leclaire, set them up with a number of protective covenants. The covenants provided for wide, curvilinear streets, large lots, and a deed restriction that limited the properties to residential or educational purposes only. The company paved the streets, provided electric street lights, installed sidewalks, and planted hundreds of trees along the streets of Leclaire. Later sections of Leclaire were laid out with a conventional grid design and smaller lots, but still included the deed restrictions.<br/><br/>A Leclaire Victorian cottage in 1907<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Initially the homes were built by the company and then sold at near cost to Nelson employees to encourage home ownership. If a worker became ill and could not make his mortgage, payments were suspended until after he returned to work. The homes were offered in a variety of house designs and the company advertised that no two dwellings were alike. The earliest homes were primarily Victorian cottages that came with electricity and running water. These were followed by bungalows, foursquares, and even some kit homes. Residents could purchase a company-built home or buy an empty lot and build a house themselves, provided the architectural design met company standards.<br/><br/>In later years, lots were sold to investors, usually Edwardsville residents, and many homes in the 1920s were built by local contractors who then sold them to area residents.<br/><br/>Education<br/><br/>Nelson believed in education for everyone, including the working class. Educational programming began with a kindergarten at the Club House in 1892 and continued in the new educational building at 722 Holyoake Road. Commonly called the "School House," this building provided a large hall for meetings and programs, but had moveable partitions to divide it into classroom space during the day. In the evenings, there were dances, meetings, or programs of the Leclaire Self-Culture Club which featured weekly lectures by Washington University professors or nationally known speakers who, like N. O. Nelson, were part of the social betterment movement at the turn of the century. These included Jane Addams, Edward Everett Hale, Samuel "Golden Rule" Jones, and author Charlotte Perkins Gilman, among others.<br/><br/>Children enrolled in the Leclaire kindergarten in 1913<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>In the ten years following the 1895 construction of the education building, there were a series of educational experiments including an industrial school, college, night school, and an academy. The earliest and longest-lived endeavor was the morning kindergarten, founded in 1892, that used the Fröbel Model. This two-year program was free to everyone, including Edwardsville children, until 1931 when for financial reasons the company began charging tuition to students who were not the children of employees. Nelson Manufacturing operated a kindergarten until 1934 when the building was turned over to the Edwardsville School District for a nominal fee.<br/><br/>Recreation<br/><br/>Boaters on Leclaire Lake in 1915<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Recreation was an important feature of Leclaire. The company provided sports facilities for baseball, tennis, and later, football. A bowling and billiard hall was constructed and there was a lake for boating, swimming, fishing, or ice skating in winter. Leclaire Park was furnished with boathouses, male & female bath houses, and a large pavilion. Residents organized dances, hayrides, spelling bees, and other activities, and the company sponsored a band that played regularly at entertainments in the village or in Edwardsville. Like the educational functions at the Club House and School House, the recreational facilities at Leclaire were open to all and were often a destination for Edwardsville and even St. Louis visitors.<br/><br/>Beauty<br/><br/>Early photograph of Leclaire Lake<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>The last of the factors Nelson deemed important for a satisfying life concerned the environment. Nelson knew about the importance of healthy living. He valued the beauty and cleanliness that could be found in the country, and encouraged all in Leclaire to beautify their property by planting gardens and orchards. Nelson himself led by example, so a company greenhouse provided free flowers and competitions were held for the most beautiful yards. Leclaire was laid out so that the entire village had a park-like setting still evident today.<br/><br/>Freedom<br/><br/>The Leclaire Cooperative store<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Nelson listed five founding principles for Leclaire, but modern writers add a sixth: Freedom. All of the programs offered by the company were available to employees as well as local residents, but none were mandatory. The freedom to choose whether or not to participate in company programs was entirely up to the individual. Residents of Leclaire could work for Nelson Manufacturing or elsewhere, and workers were under no obligation to live in Leclaire. Participation in recreational and educational programs was also optional. There was also a company store where employees could shop, but unlike other company towns, no one was in debt to the company store. The Leclaire Store was a cooperative where members were charged fair market prices, but were then paid quarterly dividends.<br/><br/>A Different Company Town<br/><br/>All of these benefits made Leclaire unique from other company towns. But there were also individual instances where the company showed compassion and care for the employees. The company closed the factories and hired excursion trains to take workers and their families to St. Louis for a day at the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair. When money was tight, Nelson would occasionally place extra cash in each pay envelope to make life easier for workers, and if he instituted a program the men did not agree with, they talked it out and, as often as not, Nelson would reverse himself.<br/><br/>Born in Lillesand, Norway, in 1841, N. O. Nelson was a complicated man. He was a capitalist who believed in free enterprise, but also a socialist, a follower of the "Golden Rule", and a patriot who served for the Union in the Civil War. By 1900, he was a multimillionaire, but by the time of his death in 1922, he had given it all away for the betterment of the working class.<br/><br/>Although Leclaire was not Nelson's only social experiment, it is considered his most successful endeavor. Other major efforts for social betterment included a chain of co-operative grocery stores in New Orleans, a kindergarten for the children of black employees in his Bessemer, Alabama, factories, and a home for consumptives in Indio, California.<br/><br/>Nelson's Village of Leclaire was renowned internationally as a noteworthy and successful experiment. It was described in the New York World on numerous occasions but in particular by reporter Nellie Bly in 1894 who wrote at length about the model town where "The labor question is solved and everybody happy in a little village near St. Louis." The Los Angeles Times also regularly reported on N. O. Nelson, as did the Chicago Daily Tribune and numerous other publications.<br/><br/>In a speech at Leclaire's 15th anniversary celebration in 1915, Nelson said, "Leclaire extends to you a wide open hospitality, and bids you enjoy today the ease and comfort and beauty and inspiration which we enjoy every day." More than a century has passed since that day, but the invitation still stands. Residents and researchers are invited to learn about Leclaire's history and consider the lessons that might be learned for the betterment of future generations.<br/><br/>One of the former buildings of the manufacturing complex in 2019, which now serves as the N. O. Nelson Campus of Lewis and Clark Community College<br/>Photo by Ben Ostermeier<br/><br/>Friends of Leclaire, organized in 1990 following Leclaire's Centennial celebration, promotes the history of Leclaire through a website (historic-leclaire.org), publications, and a festival, Leclaire Parkfest, held annually on the third Sunday in October | Leclaire<br/><br/>Povijesna četvrt Leclaire, nekada poznata kao Edwardsvilleovo "predgrađe na jugu", osnovana je kao zadružna zajednica 1890. godine i ostala je zasebno selo sve dok nije pripojena gradu Edwardsvilleu 1934. godine. Novine i časopisi diljem Sjedinjenih Država i Europe izvijestili su o Leclaireovom eksperimentu, osobito tijekom prvih 20 godina njegova postojanja. Godine 1979., zbog svoje jedinstvene povijesti, nekadašnje selo je uvršteno u Nacionalni registar povijesnih mjesta.<br/><br/>Leclaire je osnovao Nelson Oliver Nelson, proizvođač vodovoda iz St. Louisa koji je dugi niz godina nastojao unaprijediti stanje radničke klase. Nelson je želio poboljšati radne uvjete za svoje zaposlenike i osigurati smještaj u blizini tvornica kako bi radnici i njihove obitelji mogli lako sudjelovati u rekreativnim i obrazovnim programima koje tvrtka nudi besplatno. Prije 1890. godine, dok je još bio u St. Louisu, proizvodnja i distribucija tvrtke N. O. Nelson Company počela je dijeliti dobit uz obrazovne i rekreativne prilike. Leclaireov kooperativni eksperiment bi donio dodatne koristi.<br/><br/>Kada su Nelsonovi zaposlenici naznačili da se žele preseliti na ruralnu lokaciju, predstavnici tvrtke obratili su se čelnicima malih gradova u nekoliko zajednica u Missouriju i Illinoisu u blizini njihovog sjedišta u St. Louisu. Tražili su prikladnu nekretninu za izgradnju novih tvornica i model sela. Južno od Edwardsvillea pronašli su 125 hektara zemljišta s pristupom vodi, ugljenu i prijevozu. Lokalni poslovni ljudi brzo su djelovali kako bi ponudili financijski poticaj. Za manje od tri tjedna, zajednica je prikupila fond od 20.000 dolara od pojedinačnih doprinosa između 1 i 1000 dolara kako bi privukla Nelsona da odabere Edwardsville za svoj poduhvat.<br/><br/>Gradski vođe su se nadali da će locirati nekretnine unutar granica grada Edwardsvillea, ali kada se nije moglo pronaći prikladno mjesto, bili su uvjereni da će Nelsonova investicija južno od grada uskoro postati dio Edwardsvillea. Iako je Nelson ispunio sve uvjete za izgradnju i stvaranje radnih mjesta u svom ugovoru, bilo bi 44 godine prije aneksije Edwardsvillea. Leclaire, omeđen Madison/Brown Avenues na istoku, željezničke pruge na zapadu, Hadley/McKinley Avenues na jugu i Wolf Street na sjeveru, ostao je nezavisno selo od 1890. do 1934. godine. Za to vrijeme stekao je reputaciju inovacija u poslovanju, obrazovanju i stambenom planiranju.<br/><br/>Selo Leclaire na karti Edwardsvillea iz 1931. godine<br/>Ljubaznošću Paula Jenkinsa<br/><br/>Nelsonova odluka o izgradnji sela nije donesena iz hira. Do kasnih 1880-ih bio je međunarodni lider u području suradnje i podjele dobiti, razmjenjujući društvene teorije s drugima diljem svijeta dok je širio svoje poslovanje u St. Louisu. Svoje eksperimentalno selo nazvao je po pariškom profitašicu Edme Jean Leclaire, ali je posjetio mnoge druge društvene vizionare koji su pružali informacije i inspiraciju. Sastavljajući najbolje ideje iz ovih primjera, Nelson je osnovao Leclairea kako bi, prema njegovim riječima, "dao rad, promicao inteligenciju, pružio rekreaciju, njegovao ljepotu i stvorio dom." To su bili svi čimbenici koje je utvrdio potrebni za muškarce da vode ispunjene živote. Kasniji pisci koristili su ove riječi kako bi formulirali Leclaireova temeljna načela: Rad, domovi, obrazovanje, rekreacija i ljepota, ali s dodatnim važnim načelom slobode.<br/><br/>Posao<br/><br/>Rad bi se mogao smatrati najvažnijim od tih čimbenika jer bez tvorničkih radnih mjesta u Leclaireu ne bi bilo sela. Zgrade tvornice opeke projektirao je arhitekt E. A. Cameron kako bi pružio prirodno svjetlo, ventilaciju ljeti i grijane podove zimi. Postojao je sustav za suzbijanje požara i, iako industrijske nesreće nisu bile eliminirane, uloženi su svi napori kako bi se zajamčila sigurnost radnika. Zgrade prekrivene bršljanom bile su okružene dobro uređenim travnjacima i cvjetnim vrtovima koji kompleksu daju izgled nalik kampusu. Godine 1894., New York World reporter Nellie Bly nazvao je zgrade "idealnim savršenstvom zgrada za čovjeka da radi u".<br/><br/>Proizvodni kompleks N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company u Leclaireu<br/>Prijatelji Leclairea<br/><br/>Politike tvrtke Nelson osmišljene su kako bi zaštitile financijsku stabilnost zaposlenika. Radnici bi mogli zaraditi udio u profitu i imati glas u tvrtki ako su odabrali tu opciju. Plan podjele dobiti dao je zaposlenicima Nelsona ponos vlasništva koji je rezultirao potpornom radnom snagom. Tijekom godina bilo je nekoliko kratkotrajnih radnih štrajkova, ali većinom su problemi s radom bili rijetki. Radnici su također imali razumne sate i konkurentne plaće. Postojao je fond osiguranja koji je osiguravao mirovine i bolovanje, kao i udovice mirovine ako je radnik umro, bez obzira na to je li smrt bila povezana s njegovim poslom.<br/><br/>Sjedište tvrtke za N. O. Nelson Company (NONCO) ostao je u St. Louisu, ali sve N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company je premješten u Leclaire. Proizvodna tvrtka je podijeljena u trgovine koje su napravile razne proizvode. Godine 1900. trgovine su postale neovisne tvrtke za porezne svrhe, ali sve su još uvijek bile u vlasništvu N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company. Trgovine su uključivale Kabinet Mill gdje su se proizvodili proizvodi od drva od ormara do mlina. Kvalificirani obrtnici koji su ovdje radili također su ispunili posebne ugovore, uključujući kaveze za blagajnike za lokalnu banku i oltar koji se još uvijek koristi u biskupskoj crkvi sv. Mramorna trgovina specijalizirana je za arhitektonski mramor koji su izrezali i instalirali Nelsonovi posade u domovima, tvrtkama, pa čak i državnim prijestolnicama diljem Srednjeg zapada. Strojarnica, koja je postala Bignall i Keeler, izrađivala je strojeve za ugradnju cijevi, pumpe, mjerne uređaje i razne mehaničke alate koji se očekivali u industriji vodovoda. Također su se razgranali za proizvodnju specijaliziranih predmeta kao što je Leclaire Bicycle sredinom 1890-ih. Dućan za lijevanje mjedi obuhvaćao je ljevaonicu u kojoj su se proizvodile razne vodovodne cijevi i alati. Ovi primjeri predstavljaju samo neke od radova obavljenih u tvornicama Leclaire. Logotip tvrtke bio je stilizirani "NONCO" koji se i danas može vidjeti na vodovodnim instalacijama i nekim vatrogasnim hidrantima u Edwardsvilleu.<br/><br/>Kuće<br/><br/>Prije nego što su se kuće mogle izgraditi, bilo je potrebno stanovanje za radnike koji su dovršavali tvorničke zgrade, kao i za izgradnju kuća. Kako bi zadovoljili te potrebe, tvrtka je izgradila "Klubsku kuću", veliku zgradu koja je služila mnogim svrhama. Osim smještaja, to je bila prva obrazovna zgrada u zajednici, a sadržavala je i dobro opskrbljenu knjižnicu.<br/><br/>Izgradnja stambenog dijela Leclairea započela je odmah nakon što je selo osnovano u lipnju 1890. godine. Julius Pitzman, inovativni krajobrazni arhitekt koji je postavio prve parcele u Leclaireu, postavio ih je nizom zaštitnih zavjeta. Zavjeti su predviđali široke, zakrivljene ulice, velike parcele i ograničenje djela koje je ograničilo imovinu samo u stambene ili obrazovne svrhe. Tvrtka je popločala ulice, osigurala električna ulična svjetla, postavila pločnike i posadila stotine stabala duž ulica Leclairea. Kasniji dijelovi Leclairea postavljeni su s konvencionalnim dizajnom rešetke i manjim serijama, ali su i dalje uključivali ograničenja djela.<br/><br/>Viktorijanska koliba Leclaire 1907. godine<br/>Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>U početku su kuće izgrađene od strane tvrtke, a zatim prodane po gotovo trošku zaposlenicima Nelsona kako bi potaknuli vlasništvo nad kućama. Ako se radnik razbolio i nije mogao napraviti svoju hipoteku, plaćanja su suspendirana sve do nakon što se vratio na posao. Kuće su ponuđene u različitim dizajnima kuća, a tvrtka je oglašavala da nema dva stana. Najranije kuće bile su prvenstveno viktorijanske vikendice koje su dolazile sa strujom i tekućom vodom. Nakon toga slijedili su bungalovi, četverokuti, pa čak i neki kit domovi. Stanovnici su mogli kupiti kuću izgrađenu od tvrtke ili kupiti praznu parcelu i sami izgraditi kuću, pod uvjetom da arhitektonski dizajn zadovoljava standarde tvrtke.<br/><br/>U kasnijim godinama, parcele su prodane investitorima, obično stanovnicima Edwardsvillea, a mnoge kuće 1920-ih izgradili su lokalni izvođači koji su ih zatim prodali stanovnicima područja.<br/><br/>Obrazovanje<br/><br/>Nelson je vjerovao u obrazovanje za sve, uključujući i radničku klasu. Obrazovni program započeo je s vrtićem u Klubskoj kući 1892. godine i nastavio se u novoj obrazovnoj zgradi na 722 Holyoake Road. Ova zgrada, koja se obično naziva "Školska kuća", pružala je veliku dvoranu za sastanke i programe, ali imala je pomične pregrade koje su je tijekom dana dijelile u učionicu. U večernjim satima održavali su se plesovi, sastanci ili programi kluba Leclaire Self-Culture Club koji je sadržavao tjedna predavanja profesora sa Sveučilišta Washington ili nacionalno poznatih govornika koji su, poput N. O. Nelsona, bili dio pokreta za društveno poboljšanje na prijelazu stoljeća. Među njima su bili Jane Addams, Edward Everett Hale, Samuel "Zlatno pravilo" Jones i autorica Charlotte Perkins Gilman, među ostalima.<br/><br/>Djeca upisana u vrtić Leclaire 1913. godine<br/>Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>U deset godina nakon izgradnje obrazovne zgrade 1895. godine, došlo je do niza obrazovnih eksperimenata, uključujući industrijsku školu, fakultet, noćnu školu i akademiju. Najraniji i najdugovječniji pothvat bio je jutarnji vrtić, osnovan 1892. godine, koji je koristio Fröbelov model. Ovaj dvogodišnji program bio je besplatan za sve, uključujući djecu Edwardsvillea, sve do 1931. godine kada je tvrtka iz financijskih razloga počela naplaćivati školarinu studentima koji nisu djeca zaposlenika. Nelson Manufacturing je vodio vrtić sve do 1934. godine, kada je zgrada predana školskom okrugu Edwardsville za nominalnu naknadu.<br/><br/>Rekreacija<br/><br/>Brodovi na jezeru Leclaire 1915. godine<br/>Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Rekreacija je bila važna značajka Leclairea. Tvrtka je pružala sportske sadržaje za bejzbol, tenis, a kasnije i nogomet. Izgrađena je kuglana i biljar, a zimi je bilo jezero za jedrenje, plivanje, ribolov ili klizanje. Park Leclaire bio je namješten s brodskim kućama, muškim i ženskim kupalištima i velikim paviljonom. Stanovnici su organizirali plesove, plesove, pčele i druge aktivnosti, a tvrtka je sponzorirala bend koji je redovito svirao na zabavama u selu ili u Edwardsvilleu. Kao i obrazovne funkcije u klubu i školskoj kući, rekreacijski objekti u Leclaireu bili su otvoreni za sve i često su bili odredište za posjetitelje Edwardsvillea, pa čak i St. Louisa.<br/><br/>Ljepota<br/><br/>Rana fotografija jezera Leclaire<br/>Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Posljednji od čimbenika koji je Nelson smatrao važnim za zadovoljavajući život odnosio se na okoliš. Nelson je znao o važnosti zdravog života. Cijenio je ljepotu i čistoću koja se mogla naći u zemlji i potaknuo sve u Leclaireu da uljepšaju svoje imanje sadnjom vrtova i voćnjaka. Nelson je sam vodio primjerom, tako da je tvrtka staklenik osigurao besplatno cvijeće i natjecanja su održana za najljepše dvorišta. Leclaire je postavljen tako da je cijelo selo imalo park-like postavku i danas vidljivo.<br/><br/>Sloboda<br/><br/>Trgovina zadruga Leclaire<br/>Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Nelson je naveo pet temeljnih načela za Leclaire, ali moderni pisci dodaju šesti: Sloboda. Svi programi koje je tvrtka ponudila bili su dostupni zaposlenicima kao i lokalnim stanovnicima, ali nijedan nije bio obvezan. Sloboda izbora hoće li sudjelovati u programima tvrtke u potpunosti je ovisila o pojedincu. Stanovnici Leclairea mogli su raditi za Nelson Manufacturing ili drugdje, a radnici nisu bili obvezni živjeti u Leclaireu. Sudjelovanje u rekreativnim i edukativnim programima također je bilo neobavezno. Postojala je i tvrtka trgovina u kojoj su zaposlenici mogli kupovati, ali za razliku od drugih tvrtkinih gradova, nitko nije bio u dugovima prema tvrtkinoj trgovini. Trgovina Leclaire bila je zadruga u kojoj su članovi naplaćivali poštene tržišne cijene, ali su zatim isplaćivali tromjesečne dividende.<br/><br/>Drukčiji gradić<br/><br/>Sve te prednosti učinile su Leclaire jedinstvenim u odnosu na druge gradove tvrtke, ali bilo je i pojedinačnih slučajeva u kojima je tvrtka pokazala suosjećanje i brigu za zaposlenike. Tvrtka je zatvorila tvornice i unajmila izletničke vlakove kako bi odvezla radnike i njihove obitelji u St. Louis na jedan dan na Svjetskom sajmu St. Louis 1904. godine. Kada je novac bio ograničen, Nelson bi povremeno stavio dodatni novac u svaku plaću kako bi olakšao život radnicima, a ako je uspostavio program s kojim se muškarci nisu slagali, razgovarali su o tome i, koliko često ne, Nelson bi se preokrenuo.<br/><br/>Rođen u Lillesandu, Norveška, 1841. godine, N. O. Nelson je bio kompliciran čovjek. Bio je kapitalist koji je vjerovao u slobodno poduzetništvo, ali i socijalist, sljedbenik "Zlatnog pravila" i domoljub koji je služio Uniji u građanskom ratu. Do 1900. godine bio je multimilijunaš, ali do svoje smrti 1922. godine sve je dao za poboljšanje radničke klase.<br/><br/>Iako Leclaire nije bio jedini Nelsonov društveni eksperiment, smatra se njegovim najuspješnijim poduhvatom. Drugi veliki napori za društveno poboljšanje uključivali su lanac zadružnih trgovina prehrambenim proizvodima u New Orleansu, vrtić za djecu crnih zaposlenika u Bessemeru, Alabama, tvornice i dom za potrošače u Indiju, Kalifornija.<br/><br/>Nelsonovo selo Leclaire bilo je međunarodno poznato kao vrijedan i uspješan eksperiment. Opisan je u New York Worldu u brojnim prilikama, ali posebno novinarka Nellie Bly 1894. godine koja je opširno pisala o uzornom gradu gdje je "Radno pitanje riješeno i svi su sretni u malom selu blizu St. Louisa." Los Angeles Times je također redovito izvještavao o N. O.

| Author Visits via Zoom or Skype<br/><br/>I'm excited to visit with your students via Zoom or Skype! Skype is a great option for schools/classes who aren't bringing in in-person authors, but who want to explore books and poetry, connect with an author, and ask one-on-one questions.<br/><br/>Cost<br/><br/>I offer 30-45-minute Zoom or Skype visits with schools for $125 per session (or $200 for two sessions happening within three hours in the morning or the afternoon; $325 for three sessions in one day; $425 for four sessions in one day). In each session, I try to get kids as actively involved as possible. No, it's not the same kind of connection as an in-person visit offers, but it can still be inspiring and motivating for kids!<br/><br/>What I Do<br/><br/>Each session for up to 50 students includes:<br/><br/>5 minutes of tech set-up<br/><br/>3 segments of 10ish-minutes each — You choose from:<br/><br/>How I became a writer<br/><br/>Writing this particular book (you choose which book I focus on)<br/><br/>Reading (I read some poems and kids help me read others)<br/><br/>Classroom presentation (your students put on a reading or performance for me—a very appreciative audience!)<br/><br/>Writing a poem together<br/><br/>Question and answer session<br/><br/>5 minutes of wrap-ups/goodbyes<br/><br/>I also chat with classes of pre-service teachers or groups of in-service teachers about poetry and writing.<br/><br/>Tips for a Great Virtual Visit<br/><br/>Tips for a Successful Virtual Visit<br/><br/>One of my goals for virtual school visits is to capture the interactivity that makes in-person visits successful and fun. But the truth is that sometimes it's tough to be virtually interactive! The timing might not sync up correctly, which makes reading together a challenge, and it's really hard for me to hear individual students unless they come up and speak directly into the microphone/computer. But after some trial and error, I've discovered some ways to have the best virtual visits possible. Here they are: 10 ways to make my visit with your students a great experience!<br/><br/>Before the Visit<br/><br/>Get kids as excited as possible about the visit. Visit my website with them. Read some of my books with them. Gather some questions students have for me. Anything you do ahead of time to make it feel like a BIG DEAL will go a long way toward student engagement.<br/><br/>Position the video camera or laptop with webcam so that I can see as much of the audience as possible. It's hard to assess student engagement when I can only see a couple of students.<br/><br/>Limit each group to 50 students. It's incredibly hard to engage large groups via video.<br/><br/>I'll move quickly from topic to topic or poem to poem. Please remind students that they'll need to listen closely to understand what's going on.<br/><br/>Occasionally, I do a little Reader's Theater with students. If I send you any scripted student parts ahead of time, print a copy for EACH session and cut into pieces, if needed.<br/><br/>During the Visit<br/><br/>When I discuss a book, if you have that printed book, please hold it up for students to see.<br/><br/>You are my proxy. I often can't call on students and hear individual replies. So, I might say, "We're going to get 3 ideas. Raise your hand if you have an idea." Then YOU take over, call on three students, and announce those answers to everyone in the room and to me.<br/><br/>Choose confident, outgoing students for scripted student parts (if I send any ahead of time). During my in-person school visits, I try to draw out some of the less confident students, but I've found that this doesn't work as well during virtual visits because I can't hear them.<br/><br/>Have students with speaking parts sit up front. When it's time, have them stand up and remind them to speak loudly.<br/><br/>In virtual visits, behavior management falls solely on you. I often can't see exactly what's going on, so do please step in as needed. If there's a big disruption, just ask me to hold on for a moment so that I don't chatter on while nobody's paying attention:>)<br/><br/>Feel free to take pictures of me on-screen and share on social media–even though pictures of me often look ridiculous because I'm making funny faces or something while I read!<br/><br/>If you have any questions at all, please just ask, either before or during the visit!<br/><br/>Scheduling a Virtual Session<br/><br/>Are you interested in scheduling a virtual visit with me? Just email me to set up a date, and we'll go from there | Posjeti autora putem Zooma ili Skypea<br/><br/>Uzbuđen sam što ću posjetiti vaše učenike putem Zooma ili Skypea! Skype je odlična opcija za škole / razrede koji ne donose osobne autore, ali koji žele istražiti knjige i poeziju, povezati se s autorom i postaviti pitanja jedan na jedan.<br/><br/>Troškovi<br/><br/>Nudim 30-45-minutne Zoom ili Skype posjete školama za 125 dolara po sesiji (ili 200 dolara za dvije sesije koje se odvijaju u roku od tri sata ujutro ili poslijepodne; 325 dolara za tri sesije u jednom danu; 425 dolara za četiri sesije u jednom danu). U svakoj sjednici nastojim što aktivnije uključiti djecu. Ne, to nije ista vrsta veze koju nudi osobna posjeta, ali još uvijek može biti inspirativna i motivirajuća za djecu!<br/><br/>Što radim<br/><br/>Svaka sesija za do 50 učenika uključuje:<br/><br/>5 minuta tehnološkog podešavanja<br/><br/>3 segmenta od 10ish-minutes svaki — Možete birati između:<br/><br/>Kako sam postao pisac<br/><br/>Pisanje ove knjige (ti biraš na koju knjigu ću se usredotočiti)<br/><br/>Čitanje (Čitam neke pjesme, a djeca mi pomažu čitati druge)<br/><br/>Prezentacija u učionici (vaši učenici stavili na čitanje ili nastup za mene - vrlo zahvalna publika!)<br/><br/>Pisanje pjesme zajedno<br/><br/>Sjednica pitanja i odgovora<br/><br/>5 minuta zamotavanja / oproštaja<br/><br/>Također razgovaram s razredima predškolskih nastavnika ili skupinama nastavnika u službi o poeziji i pisanju.<br/><br/>Savjeti za odličan virtualni posjet<br/><br/>Savjeti za uspješan virtualni posjet<br/><br/>Jedan od mojih ciljeva za virtualne školske posjete je uhvatiti interaktivnost koja čini osobne posjete uspješnim i zabavnim. Ali istina je da je ponekad teško biti virtualno interaktivan! Tajming se možda ne sinkronizira ispravno, što čitanje zajedno čini izazovom, i stvarno mi je teško čuti pojedinačne učenike osim ako ne dođu i govore izravno u mikrofon / računalo. Ali nakon nekog pokušaja i pogreške, otkrio sam neke načine da imaju najbolje virtualne posjete moguće. Evo ih: 10 načina da moj posjet sa svojim studentima veliko iskustvo!<br/><br/>Prije posjeta<br/><br/>Uzbudite djecu što je više moguće o posjetu. Posjetite moju web stranicu s njima. Pročitajte neke od mojih knjiga s njima. Prikupite neka pitanja koja studenti imaju za mene. Sve što učinite unaprijed kako biste se osjećali kao VELIKI DOGOVOR će ići dug put prema angažmanu studenata.<br/><br/>Postavite video kameru ili prijenosno računalo s web kamerom tako da mogu vidjeti što je više moguće publike. Teško je procijeniti angažman studenata kada mogu vidjeti samo nekoliko studenata.<br/><br/>Ograničite svaku grupu na 50 učenika. Nevjerojatno je teško uključiti velike grupe putem videozapisa.<br/><br/>Brzo ću prijeći s teme na temu ili pjesmu na pjesmu. Podsjetite učenike da će morati pažljivo slušati kako bi razumjeli što se događa.<br/><br/>Povremeno radim malo Reader's Theater sa studentima. Ako vam pošaljem bilo kakve skriptirane studentske dijelove unaprijed, ispišite kopiju za SVAKU sesiju i izrežite na komade, ako je potrebno.<br/><br/>Tijekom posjeta<br/><br/>Kada govorim o knjizi, ako imate tu tiskanu knjigu, molimo vas da je držite da je studenti mogu vidjeti.<br/><br/>Ti si moj zastupnik. Često ne mogu nazvati studente i čuti pojedinačne odgovore. Tako, mogao bih reći, "Mi ćemo dobiti 3 ideje. Podignite ruku ako imate ideju." Zatim preuzmite, nazovite tri studenta i objavite te odgovore svima u sobi i meni.<br/><br/>Izaberite samouvjerene, odlazne studente za skriptirane studentske dijelove (ako ih pošaljem unaprijed). Tijekom mojih osobnih posjeta školi, pokušavam izvući neke od manje samouvjerenih učenika, ali otkrio sam da to ne funkcionira tako dobro tijekom virtualnih posjeta jer ih ne mogu čuti.<br/><br/>Neka učenici s govornim dijelovima sjednu naprijed. Kada je vrijeme, neka ustanu i podsjete ih da govore glasno.<br/><br/>U virtualnim posjetima, upravljanje ponašanjem pada isključivo na vas. Često ne mogu točno vidjeti što se događa, pa vas molimo da uskočite po potrebi. Ako dođe do velikog poremećaja, samo me zamolite da se zadržim na trenutak kako ne bih brbljao dok nitko ne obraća pažnju:>)<br/><br/>Slobodno me slikajte na ekranu i dijelite na društvenim mrežama – iako moje slike često izgledaju smiješno jer pravim smiješna lica ili nešto dok čitam!<br/><br/>Ako imate bilo kakvih pitanja, samo pitajte, prije ili tijekom posjeta!<br/><br/>Zakazivanje virtualne sesije<br/><br/>Zainteresirani ste za zakazivanje virtualnog posjeta sa mnom? Samo mi pošaljite e-mail da zakažem datum, i idemo odatle |

On the one hand it has prompted stigma and violence and on the other it has brought about constructive and supportive responses from various individuals and groups. A new book, Acting on HIV, edited by Prof. Dennis Francis, Dean of the Faculty of Education at the University of the Free State, looks at how drama can be used to promote vital social change as well as individual behavioural change.<br/><br/>Acting on HIV offers a systematic inquiry into drama as an approach to discuss HIV/AIDS and related attitudes and behaviours. The book is a scholarly text and includes the work of some twenty exceptionally creative authors. Contributing authors to the book include, amongst others, Proff. Hazel Barnes (University of the Witwatersrand), Rob Pattman (Stellenbosch University) and Yvonne Sliep from the University of KwaZulu-Natal.<br/><br/>"This project started in 2009 and has taken much of my time to bring together the work of exceptionally creative authors. The research that is communicated through the book is original and timely and makes a significant contribution to conversations about the role/s and significance of drama in addressing issues of HIV & AIDS," says Prof. Francis | Arhiva vijesti<br/><br/>Nova knjiga razmatra načine rješavanja HIV izazova<br/><br/>2011-11-29<br/><br/>Prof. Dennis Francis s Marjorie Human koji je dizajnirao naslovnicu knjige, Djelovanje na HIV.<br/><br/>Pandemija HIV-a iznijela je najbolje i najgore u ljudima u smislu odgovora. S jedne strane potaknula je stigmu i nasilje, a s druge strane dovela je do konstruktivnih i podržavajućih odgovora različitih pojedinaca i skupina. Nova knjiga, Djelovanje o HIV-u, koju je uredio prof. Dennis Francis, dekan Pedagoškog fakulteta Sveučilišta Slobodne države, razmatra kako se drama može koristiti za promicanje vitalnih društvenih promjena, kao i individualnih promjena u ponašanju.<br/><br/>Djelovanje o HIV-u nudi sustavno istraživanje drame kao pristupa raspravi o HIV-u / AIDS-u i povezanim stavovima i ponašanjima. Knjiga je znanstveni tekst i uključuje rad dvadesetak iznimno kreativnih autora. Autori knjige su, između ostalog, prof. Hazel Barnes (Sveučilište Witwatersrand), Rob Pattman (Stellenbosch Sveučilište) i Yvonne Sliep sa Sveučilišta KwaZulu-Natal.<br/><br/>"Ovaj projekt započeo je 2009. godine i oduzeo mi je puno vremena da okupim radove iznimno kreativnih autora. Istraživanje koje se prenosi kroz knjigu je originalno i pravovremeno i daje značajan doprinos razgovorima o ulozi i značaju drame u rješavanju problema HIV-a i AIDS-a", kaže prof. |

The results show that they cannibalized two crabs in the trap, then, at least for the duration of my test, were satiated.<br/><br/>Ghost traps do affect the organisms stuck in them, namely C. sapidus.C. sapidus has no problem resorting to cannibalism when no other food source is available.Cannot extrapolate my data over whole bay. | Transcript of Testiranje utjecaja duhovnih zamki na Plavi rak, Callinectis Sapidus , u zaljevu Barnegat<br/><br/>Michael FranklinMarine Field Methods16. rujna 2008.<br/><br/>Odlučio sam koristiti Plavi rak, Callinectus sapidus, za moj eksperiment jer je ovdje u zaljevu Barnegat u izobilju i relativno je lako uhvatiti.<br/><br/>Callinectes sapidus je rak plivački važan za komercijalne rakove s mekom školjkom, komercijalne i rekreativne (Jivoff 2008)<br/><br/>Zamke za duhove javljaju se kada se zamka izgubi, ali nastavlja hvatati organizme (Breen 1990)John Wnek kaže da u Barnegat Bayu ima lako 2.000 Budući da je C. sapidus tako agresivan (Pollock 1998) , što se događa kada se zaglave u kavezu bez hrane i kakav utjecaj to ima?<br/><br/>Ako je uhvaćen u zamku duhova, C. sapidus će imati kanibalističke tendencije sve dok posljednji ne umre od gladi.<br/><br/>Kako možemo duplicirati duhovnu zamku u laboratoriju?Stvorite duhovnu zamku zatvaranjem ulaza s žičanom mrežom i zip kravatamaKada se uzorak učita, zatvorite vrh sa zip kravatama<br/><br/>Ulaz za rakove zatvoren žičanom mrežom<br/><br/>Crab TrapWire Mesh Wire CuttersRopeKameraZip kravate<br/><br/>Kako ćemo dobiti rakove?Zamka nekoliko dana ranije i izgladnjivati ihKada ste spremni za početak, prikupiti nove rakove iz zamkiDodajte izravno u duhovnu zamku s 2 iz izgladnjelog spremnika<br/><br/>Šest rakova ukupno, jedan nedostajePronađen je mali prostor za bijeg; zakrpljen sa zip kravatomDva krava mrtvaJedan je ostao samo kandžamaDrugi nedostaju oba lopatica i jedna kandža<br/><br/>Četiri kraba su živa i netaknutaVeća mrtva kraba nema promjeneManja mrtva kraba ima samo dio karapike.<br/><br/>Posljednji dan pokusaUzorkovanje dvaju uzorakaBez promjene od drugog dana u prvom uzorkuDrugo promatranje, veći karapiks odvojen od ostatka tijela/kandži<br/><br/>Na temelju rezultata, odbacujem svoju nultu hipotezu da će rakovi jednostavno biti u zamci.

| Storyworld Spotlight<br/><br/>25 years of Tomb Raider<br/><br/>Tomb Raider is one of the most recognizable entertainment properties in the world. Since Lara Croft's first videogame appearance in Tomb Raider (1996), her exploits as an adventurous and quick-witted explorer have resonated widely with players, earning her a place in the pantheon of great pop culture characters. For that reason we will be putting The World of Lara Croft in the Storyworld Spotlight from December 22, 2021 to March 6, 2022.<br/><br/>Crafting a Croft<br/><br/>Lara Croft was created by studio Core Design, in Derby (UK), in 1996. The studio was looking for a lead character for their upcoming a 3D adventure game for PlayStation 1. A game in a 3rd person perspective where players would see the main character in full throughout every scene.<br/><br/>As the game was about 'raiding mysterious tombs deep under pyramids,' the lead character would need to look adventurous, and have the brains to survive complex raiding missions. After some deliberation, Lara Croft was born, a young, upper-class and utterly British woman, who was as enigmatic and intelligent as she was tough and self-reliant.<br/><br/>Success and controversy<br/><br/>Tomb Raider (1996) was a breakaway success for Core Design, who quickly doubled down on building Tomb Raider 2 (1997) and 3 (1998). A big part of the success was attributed to the games' leading lady, who found admirers both with male and female players. This baffled critics who just saw Lara Croft as a sexist cartoon.<br/><br/>Explore The World of Lara Croft in Storyworld<br/><br/>This exhibition explores the successful franchise in-depth. It looks at the history of the games and why its leading lady resonates with so many people. It also dives into the mystery of what makes Tomb Raider games tick, from the deep world building to the clever puzzles and traps, and from fantastic enemy and monster designs to the character design of the legendary heroine.<br/><br/>After all, mysteries are there to explore, and have been for the past 25 years.<br/><br/>Tickets<br/><br/>Buy your tickets for Storyworld online with a start date and entry time from Wednesday December 22.

Otkad se Lara Croft prvi put pojavila u video igrici Tomb Raider (1996.), njezini podvizi kao pustolovni i brzi istraživači odjeknuli su s igračima, zaradivši joj mjesto u panteonu velikih likova pop kulture.

Studio je tražio glavnog lika za nadolazeću 3D avanturu za PlayStation 1. Igra u perspektivi treće osobe u kojoj bi igrači vidjeli glavnog lika u cijelosti tijekom svake scene.<br/><br/>Budući da je igra bila o "pljačkanju tajanstvenih grobnica duboko pod piramidama", glavni lik morao bi izgledati avanturistički i imati mozak da preživi složene racije. Nakon nekog razmišljanja, rođena je Lara Croft, mlada, više klase i potpuno Britanka, koja je bila jednako zagonetna i inteligentna kao što je bila tvrda i samopouzdana.<br/><br/>Uspjeh i kontroverze<br/><br/>Tomb Raider (1996) bio je separatistički uspjeh za Core Design, koji se brzo udvostručio na izgradnji Tomb Raider 2 (1997) i 3 (1998). Veliki dio uspjeha pripisan je vodećoj dami igara, koja je pronašla obožavatelje i kod muških i kod ženskih igrača.

| Real Estate Word of the Day: Option<br/><br/>Option: An agreement to keep open, for a set period, an offer to sell or lease real property. An option can be used, for example, to give the buyer time to resolve questions of financing, title, zoning and feasibility before committing the buyer to purchase. Options are frequently used in the land assemblage process. The option must be supported by its actual consideration, separate and independent of the purchase price of the property. Mere recital of consideration alone is not sufficient except in a lease-option in which the provisions of the lease are themselves sufficient consideration to support the option. An option merely creates a contractual right; it does not give the optionee any estate in the property. At the time the option is signed, the owner does not sell, nor does the buyer purchase, the property. Although the owner is obligated to sell if given notice by the buyer, the buyer is not obligated to purchase. An option to buy is also known as a call; an option to sell is known as a put. | Nekretnine Riječ dana: opcija<br/><br/>Opcija: Ugovor o zadržavanju otvorene, za određeno razdoblje, ponude za prodaju ili najam nekretnina. Opcija se može koristiti, na primjer, kako bi se kupcu dalo vrijeme za rješavanje pitanja financiranja, naslova, zoniranja i izvedivosti prije obvezivanja kupca na kupnju. Opcije se često koriste u procesu montaže zemljišta. Opcija mora biti potkrijepljena stvarnim razmatranjem, odvojeno i neovisno o kupovnoj cijeni nekretnine. Sama uvodna izjava o razmatranju nije dovoljna, osim u slučaju opcije najma u kojem su odredbe o najmu same po sebi dovoljne za potporu opciji. Opcija samo stvara ugovorno pravo; ona ne daje opcijinika bilo kakvu imovinu u nekretnini. U trenutku potpisivanja opcije vlasnik ne prodaje, niti kupac kupuje nekretninu. Iako je vlasnik dužan prodati ako ga kupac obavijesti, kupac nije dužan kupiti. Opcija kupnje poznata je i kao poziv; opcija prodaje poznata je kao put. |
| Benefits of Carotenoids for the Skin<br/><br/>Have you heard of carotenoids? These powerful phytochemicals are the pigmented constituents found in plants that give flowers, fruits, and leaves their yellow, orange and red colours.<br/><br/>Since the 1930s, scientists have identified about 800 carotenoids and about 40 are found in the human body, including the outermost layer of the epidermis, the dermis and subcutaneous fat. The most common carotenoids are beta-carotene, alpha-carotene, lutein, zeaxanthin, lycopene, and astaxanthin. You can read more about astaxanthin here.<br/><br/>The content of carotenoids in the skin is influenced by numerous factors, including the intake of fruits and vegetables, their bioavailability from various foods, supplementation, exposure to UV radiation, air pollution, alcohol consumption, smoking and stress.<br/><br/>How do Carotenoids Help My Skin?<br/><br/>Carotenoids are some of the best-known antioxidants for the skin and they also have important functions as anti-inflammatory agents.<br/><br/>Healthy Aging and Skin Repair<br/><br/>Antioxidants are essential for healthy skin because they help to prevent free radical damage to cells. Free radical damage causes premature aging and the onset of various types of skin cancers. Carotenoids, along with vitamin E, vitamin C, and Co enzyme Q10 are important dermal antioxidants.<br/><br/>Due to their antioxidant activity, carotenoids support and encourage collagen and elastin production in the skin. This helps to increase the skin's density, thickness, elasticity, and firmness. Collagen and elastin decrease as we age, so getting enough carotenoids in the diet and topically is critical for aging well.<br/><br/>Carotenoids can improve the signs of photoaging, skin discolouration, elasticity, hydration, texture, and can reduce transepidermal water loss.<br/><br/>Astaxanthin in particular stimulates fibroblasts to produce collagen and elastin, inhibits the activity of the enzymes that breakdown collagen and elastin, and shows anti-inflammatory and UV-filtering effects. It has been shown to reduce melanin in the skin, which results in the decrease in the appearance of freckles and melasma.<br/><br/>Anti-acne activity: the anti-inflammatory activity of carotenoids helps to dampen the inflammation and irritation associated with acne. Carotenoids also help to normalize and balance oil secretions from the sebaceous glands. They are valuable agents in skin repair and they stimulate epidermal regeneration, helping to smooth and soften skin.<br/><br/>Where Can I Find Carotenoids?<br/><br/>There are two ways to get your daily dose of carotenoids: through diet and through topical application. The combination of both is the ideal approach to well-aging skincare.<br/><br/>Carotenoids are fat-soluble, so your body needs fat to absorb them (think tomatoes and olive oil, broccoli and butter, or spinach and avocado). Common sources of carotenoids in food are avocado, egg yolks, kale, spinach, carrots, sweet potatoes, papaya, and tomatoes.<br/><br/>While we advocate getting as many of your nutrients and antioxidants as you can from food rather than supplementation; one study showed that astaxanthin combined with collagen hydrolysate significantly improved barrier integrity, reduced transepidermal water loss, and increased the expression of procollagen type I mRNA.<br/><br/>Topical application is key to healthy skin. Studies show that high concentrations of antioxidants in human skin offer the best protection for healthy skin at any age.<br/><br/>At Sarka Botanicals, we blend carotenoid-rich, whole plants such as calendula, dandelion, and extracts like astaxanthin with cold-pressed oils and functional ingredients. Calendula alone contains over 19 different types of carotenoids. This may explain why it has such a long history of use in skin care. Studies show that carotenoids blended with co-enzyme Q10 are especially effective at reducing inflammation and slowing premature skin aging due to sun exposure. | Prednosti karotenoida za kožu<br/><br/>Jeste li čuli za karotenoide? Ove moćne fitokemikalije su pigmentirani sastojci koji se nalaze u biljkama koje daju cvijeće, plodove i ostavljaju žute, narančaste i crvene boje.<br/><br/>Od 1930-ih znanstvenici su identificirali oko 800 karotenoida, a oko 40 ih se nalazi u ljudskom tijelu, uključujući najudaljeniji sloj epiderme, dermisa i potkožne masti. Najčešći karotenoidi su beta-karoten, alfa-karoten, lutein, zeaksantin, likopen i astaksantin. Više o astaksantinu možete pročitati ovdje.<br/><br/>Na sadržaj karotenoida u koži utječu brojni čimbenici, uključujući unos voća i povrća, njihovu bioraspoloživost iz raznih namirnica, dodataka prehrani, izloženosti UV zračenju, zagađenju zraka, konzumaciji alkohola, pušenju i stresu.<br/><br/>Kako karotenoidi pomažu mojoj koži?<br/><br/>Karotenoidi su neki od najpoznatijih antioksidansa za kožu, a također imaju važne funkcije kao protuupalni agensi.<br/><br/>Zdravo starenje i popravak kože<br/><br/>Antioksidansi su neophodni za zdravu kožu jer pomažu spriječiti oštećenje stanica slobodnim radikalima. Oštećenje slobodnih radikala uzrokuje prerano starenje i pojavu različitih vrsta raka kože. Karotenoidi, zajedno s vitaminom E, vitaminom C i Co enzimom Q10, važni su dermalni antioksidansi.<br/><br/>Zbog svoje antioksidativne aktivnosti, karotenoidi podržavaju i potiču proizvodnju kolagena i elastina u koži. To pomaže povećati gustoću, debljinu, elastičnost i čvrstoću kože. Kolagen i elastin se smanjuju kako starimo, tako da je dobivanje dovoljno karotenoida u prehrani i lokalno kritično za dobro starenje.<br/><br/>Karotenoidi mogu poboljšati znakove fotostarenja, promjene boje kože, elastičnosti, hidratacije, teksture i mogu smanjiti transepidermalni gubitak vode.<br/><br/>Astaksantin posebno stimulira fibroblaste za proizvodnju kolagena i elastina, inhibira aktivnost enzima koji razgrađuju kolagen i elastin te pokazuje protuupalne i UV-filtrirajuće učinke. Pokazalo se da smanjuje melanin u koži, što rezultira smanjenjem pojave pjega i melazme.<br/><br/>Anti-akne aktivnost: protuupalno djelovanje karotenoida pomaže ublažiti upalu i iritaciju povezanu s aknama. Karotenoidi također pomažu normalizirati i uravnotežiti sekret ulja iz lojnih žlijezda. Oni su vrijedni agensi u popravku kože i stimuliraju regeneraciju epiderme, pomažući u zaglađivanju i omekšavanju kože.<br/><br/>Gdje mogu pronaći karotenoide?<br/><br/>Postoje dva načina za dobivanje dnevne doze karotenoida: dijetom i lokalnom primjenom. Kombinacija oba je idealan pristup njezi kože dobrog starenja.<br/><br/>Karotenoidi su topivi u mastima, tako da vaše tijelo treba masti da ih apsorbira (mislite na rajčice i maslinovo ulje, brokule i maslac, ili špinat i avokado). Uobičajeni izvori karotenoida u hrani su avokado, žumanjci, kelj, špinat, mrkva, slatki krumpir, papaja i rajčica.<br/><br/>Iako se zalažemo za dobivanje što više hranjivih tvari i antioksidansa iz hrane, a ne dodataka prehrani, jedna studija pokazala je da je astaksantin u kombinaciji s hidrolizata kolagena značajno poboljšao integritet barijere, smanjio transepidermalni gubitak vode i povećao ekspresiju prokolagena tipa I mRNA.<br/><br/>Lokalna primjena je ključna za zdravu kožu. Istraživanja pokazuju da visoke koncentracije antioksidanata u ljudskoj koži pružaju najbolju zaštitu za zdravu kožu u bilo kojoj dobi.<br/><br/>U Sarka Botanicals miješamo bogate karotenoidima, cijele biljke kao što su nevena, maslačak i ekstrakti poput astaksantina s hladno prešanim uljima i funkcionalnim sastojcima. Samo nevena sadrži preko 19 različitih vrsta karotenoida. Istraživanja pokazuju da su karotenoidi pomiješani s koenzimom Q10 posebno učinkoviti u smanjenju upale i usporavanju prijevremenog starenja kože zbog izlaganja suncu. |
