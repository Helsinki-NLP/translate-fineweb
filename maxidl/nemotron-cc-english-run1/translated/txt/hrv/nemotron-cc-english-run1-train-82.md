In simple terms, the condition is characterized by: one develops a kidney disease and undergoes a kidney transplant and other diseases associated with acidic concentration in the blood and gout. In theory, the condition will occur even if the genetic change is inherited from one parent and sporadically occurs when there is no family history.<br/><br/>Common names of autosomal dominant interstitial kidney disease<br/><br/>The condition has other names as well namely: medullary cystic kidney disease, although this name is not used as much because most people suffering from this condition do not have medullary cysts. It is also referred to as juvenile hyperuricemic nephropathy. The disease tends to affect people of ages 20 to 50. The latter condition as aforementioned occurs in young children, something, which translate to get it from both parents.<br/>Cystic kidney disease is an inherited condition whereby the cysts in the centre of each kidney gradually lose their ability to function properly. Cysts refer to abnormal blisters of fluid in the kidney. The condition further scares the kidney making unable to concentrate the urine and as a result, producing too much urine. Its symptoms include excessive urination, salt cravings, weakness, confusion, bleeding, fatigue, frequent hiccups, low blood pressure, nausea and vomiting, headaches, pale skin, reduced sensation in the hands, weight loss among many others. Other complications include: anemia, ulcers, loss of bone density, infertility and other heart related problems.<br/>Its analysis incorporates blood tests to check for sodium levels and general kidney functions, urine tests to check the levels of concentration and other imbalances, x rays to check for the size of kidneys that may be altered owing to increased urine concentrations, renal biopsy and genetic testing to verify any genetic changes that might have taken place in due time.<br/>While the disease does not have a cut and dry treatment to it, one may focus on controlling measures, which include intake of fluids and salt to supplement the one lost as the disease progresses into latter stages. This also helps reduce dehydration. Other treatments include taking of prescribed medication and diet changes and minimal intakes of foods containing phosphorous and potassium. Further complications may also require one to have a kidney transplant. Basically, this is not a curable disease but rather a manageable once detected in the early stages.<br/><br/>The common yet different factor of Autosomal dominant interstitial kidney disease<br/><br/>Nephronophthisis and medullary cystic kidney disease are mainly grouped together because, in essence, they share the same features but with a slight difference in regards inheritance patterns to the former affecting children and the latter affecting young adults and older age groups. Similar features for both are ADH resistant urine concentration that leads to polyuria and polydipsia, anemia and renal diseases.<br/>The former aforementioned condition is Autosomal recessive accounting to 15% of chronic diseases and causes ESRD during early childhood while the latter is Autosomal dominant with a few sporadic new mutations and causes ESRD for people between the ages of 30 and 50. | Online CPR certifikacija Blog<br/><br/>Datum: 23. srpnja 2014.<br/><br/>Autosomno dominantna intersticijska bolest bubrega je rijetka zbirka bolesti koje utječu na poznate funkcije bubrega.

| Hobbes' vs. Locke's Account on the State of Nature<br/><br/>Topic: PhilosophyWords: 2539Pages: 9Aug 3rd, 2021<br/><br/>Hobbes and Locke are among the most influential political philosophers to ever write in English. The state of nature, which precedes the organization of the complex societies, is the common premise that both Hobbes and Locke share but interpret in different ways. The former views humans in their natural state as equally dangerous and free to pursue their egoistic goals unrestricted by the nonexistent notions of justice, which is why his natural state amounts to the "war of every man against every man" (Hobbes76). The latter, on the other hand, views humans in their original condition as equally valuable and restricts natural freedom by the idea of justice that requires not to harm others, which allows defining the state of nature as "mutual assistance and preservation" rather than war (Locke 15). The key difference between the two philosophers' accounts of natural state is that Locke uses ethical considerations while Hobbes does not, and it ultimately leads Hobbes to envisage a state exercising unlimited power over human beings, while Locke limits the government by the moral principles, which he considers a natural law.<br/><br/>Hobbes bases his assumptions regarding the state of nature on the fact that all people are roughly equal in their physical and mental capabilities. He admits that some individuals may demonstrate greater physical strength or superior intellect but insists that "when all is reckoned together, the difference between man and man is not so considerable" (Hobbes 74). Since humans are roughly equal in their capabilities, they also have similar hopes to attain their ends and satisfy their needs (Hobbes 75). As a logical outcome of this equality, when the people begin competing for scarce resources, no one may feel entirely secure in his or her possessions. Even if a mighty, cunning, and capable person succeeds in subjugating "the persons of all men he can," it still does not guarantee the ultimate security (Hobbes 75). As no human can obtain such superiority over the others that renders him or her utterly immune to their strength of intellect, no human can feel completely safe when surrounded by his or her equals. Hobbes' equality in the natural state is equality of fear, where all humans view each other as dangerous competitors.<br/><br/>Just as Hobbes, Locke considers all human beings to be fundamentally equal, but assigns a very different meaning to the term. From his perspective, it is not the equality of capabilities, but, rather, the equality of value. He opines that the people "promiscuously born to all the same advantages of nature" should logically enjoy the perfect equality among them, as there is no reason to consider anyone inherently more valuable (Locke 8). The only possible foundation for designating some people as superior to others would be if God "by any manifest declaration of his will, set one above another" (Locke 8). Since such divine sanction of superiority is absent, Locke concludes that the natural equality of all representatives of humankind is not to be called into question. Hobbes approaches equality pragmatically and stresses that people in their natural state are equally dangerous, but Locke employs an ethical approach and emphasizes that humans are equally valuable in God's eyes. This disagreement is but the first difference between the two authors based on the fact that Locke includes God as a premise into his political philosophy, while Hobbes does not.<br/><br/>Another characteristic feature of Hobbes' account of the natural state is his interpretation of liberty. According to Hobbes, the state of nature implies unlimited freedom to do whatever is necessary for one's continued existence. The philosopher defines liberty as "the absence of external impediments" in using one's abilities to attain one's goals (Hobbes 79). The primary purpose of every sentient being is to maintain its continued existence. As a consequence, Hobbesian freedom amounts to the unhindered opportunity to do anything that, in one's judgment, would be best suited to preserve one's life and possessions (Hobbes 79). The only limitation to liberty is that a person cannot do anything contradictory to sustaining his or her life or destroying "the means of preserving the same" (Hobbes 79). Apart from that, there are no boundaries, and everyone has "a right to everything, even to one another's body" if that furthers one's survival (Hobbes 80). Thus, natural liberty, as viewed by Hobbes, is the absence of externally enforced obstacles in pursuing one's right to everything to sustain and secure one's continued existence.<br/><br/>Locke also upholds the idea of natural liberty but, unsurprisingly, approaches it in a manner that is significantly different from that of Hobbes. As soon as he begins discussing liberty in the state of nature, he immediately notes that a state of freedom does not equate "a state of license" (Locke 9). The philosopher identifies two specific limitations to human freedom in the state of nature. The first one is identical to that introduce by Hobbes: however free and independent, a person nevertheless "has not liberty to destroy himself" (Locke 9). Yet the second limitation contradicts Hobbes' prepositions directly. According to Locke, every human being has a natural obligation not to "harm another in his life, health, liberty, or possessions" (9). Just as with his interpretation of equality, the author bases this assertion on ethical and religious grounds: people should preserve each other's existence since they are all creations of the same "omnipotent, and infinitely wise maker" (Locke 9). Thus, Locke's limits liberty in the natural state far more stringently than Hobbes by introducing the obligation to refrain from harming both oneself and the others.<br/><br/>The differences between the two authors also manifest in their accounts of justice in the natural state of humanity. As far as Hobbes is concerned, delineating just and unjust practices is merely the matter of the law. There is no jurisprudence in the state of nature, and the only law governing human beings in their original condition is a natural law that only obliges them to seek personal security. As a result, nothing can be unjust in the original state of the humankind: "notions of right and wrong justice and injustice" have no place and no meaning in the absence of the stringently enforced law (Hobbes 78). As long as the people use their virtually unlimited freedom to ruthlessly compete with each other for resources, to which they are equally entitled, they have no criteria to differentiate between just and unjust actions. Therefore, the Hobbesian state of nature defies the very idea of justice since the author interprets it as a mere function of the formalized and established law.<br/><br/>Locke assigns different meaning to justice and views it not so much in legislative as in the ethical terms. This paper already mentioned that, unlike Hobbes, Locke employs ethical notions and generally bases his political philosophy on moral rather than purely practical presumptions. Locke's natural law, unlike that of Hobbes, obliges human beings to take care of each other rather than simply leaving everyone to fend for themselves. As a result, there is a place for justice and injustice in his state of nature. The author points to this fact himself when noting that no one should deprive another of his or her life of the means of preserving it "unless it be to do justice on an offender" (Locke 9). This statement reveals with the utmost clarity that, according to Locke, there is justice in the state of nature, and, moreover, humans have to preserve it actively. The criterion of justice, which Hobbes' natural state lacks, is the second limitation on natural liberty imposed by Locke: an action is unjust if it constitutes an unwarranted threat to another person's life and possessions.<br/><br/>These differences in the two authors' treatment of equality, liberty, and justice or injustice culminate in their interpretation of the relationship between the state of nature and the state of war. From Hobbes's perspective, the two are synonymous, because the ruthless competition is the only logical outcome of putting people with equivalent capabilities and similar needs in an environment with limited resources. He states this connection outright: "if any two men desire the same thing, which nevertheless they cannot both enjoy, they become enemies" and are, therefore, in the state of war with each other (Hobbes 75). Yet since humans are numerous and all possess similar capabilities and needs, this competition manifests not only in the individual interactions but also on the level of humanity as a whole. As long as all humans have equal and unlimited rights to all resources and even to each other's bodies and lives, the state of nature is a war of "every man against every man" (Hobbes 76). This grim interpretation stems directly from Hobbes' portrayal of the state of nature as governed solely by the individuals' egoistic urges.<br/><br/>Locke, on the other hand, differentiates between the state of nature and the state of war and points out that, while they may occur simultaneously, it is no reason to identify one with the other. Locke's definition of the state of war is virtually identical to that offered by Hobbes. According to Locke, "he who attempts to get another man into his absolute power does thereby put himself into a state of war with him" (14). This explanation lines up perfectly with the Hobbesian notion that everyone's universal right to everything, including the other people's bodies and lives, leads to the state of war. Yet Locke refuses to equate the state of war and the state of nature precisely because he denies Hobbes' interpretation of natural freedom. Since Locke's natural state restrains people from harming each other through the second limitation of liberty, an attempt on another person's freedom is a transgression against the natural law. While for Hobbes, war is the humankind's condition by default, Locke portrays it as a perversion of the state of nature rather than its rule.<br/><br/>These differences in delineating the state on nature and its constituents, such as liberty, equality, justice, and war, pave the way to the authors contrasting portrayals of government. Based on his pessimistic assessment of the state of nature, the author of Leviathan concludes that, under conditions of war, there can be no definite hope for "living out the time which nature ordinarily alloweth men to live" (Hobbes 80). The solution is laying down the universal right to everything and leaving everyone "so much liberty against other men, as he would allow other men against himself" (Hobbes 80). The participants of the resulting social contract invest the unlimited liberties they have surrendered into a sovereign – the bearer of the supreme power whose purpose is to preserve the achieved status quo by punishing all transgressions against it. Sovereign's power is absolute: the ruler has the authority "to do whatsoever he shall think necessary" to promote peace between his subjects so that no one would assail another's life or property (113). Hobbes concludes that without such an unassailable figure entitled with the right to do anything to the subjects, there can be no peace and no guarantee of security.<br/><br/>While Locke agrees with the necessity of creating politically organized societies, he nevertheless opposes Hobbes' idea of the sovereign power as unlimited and unassailable. As mentioned above, Locke's state of nature is not nearly as dreadful as that painted by Hobbes because of the people's obligation to preserve not only themselves but each other as well. Therefore, the need for social contract arises not from the fear of the others, but from the sheer convenience. Small communities may not need numerous laws to solve conflicts and "officers to superintend the process," but larger associations find it advisable to institute governments for that purpose (Locke 57). Yet the power of the government cannot be unlimited because it would result in subduing the subjects to an "inconstant, uncertain, unknown, arbitrary will of another man" (Locke 17). Such a government would constitute a twofold violation of the natural law. By agreeing to another person's absolute power over his life, a subject would violate its first limitation prohibiting to harm oneself. As for the ruler, destroying another person's liberty would constitute direct harm and, as such, be contradictory to the second limitation.<br/><br/>As a direct continuation of his case for unlimited governmental authority, Hobbes denies the separation of powers as a principle. From his perspective, the sovereign, once instituted, possesses "the whole power of prescribing the rules" governing the lives of the subjects or, in shorter terms, the legislative power (Hobbes 114). The sovereign also reserves the right of "hearing and deciding all controversies" – that is, the judicial power (Hobbes 114). Finally, since the entire purpose of the sovereign is to force the subjects to refrain from harming each other, there can be no doubt that executive power is also his or her exclusive prerogative. The separation of powers as a concept is alien to Hobbes because of his views on the state of nature. Creating a political entity where the executive, legislative, and judicial branches would check each other – that is, compete – would mean recreating the Hobbesian state of nature-as-war on a higher level. Since the people enter a social contract and institute a government to put the state of nature behind them, not reinstate it in a different form, the separation of powers contradictory Hobbes' views directly.<br/><br/>Locke, on the other hand, embraces separation of power as a foundational principle of his political theory. His case for the separation is evident in the discussion of the limits of the legislative power. As Locke puts it, it would be hardly advisable "for the same persons, who have the power of making laws, to have also in their hands the power to execute them" (76). The philosopher points to the imperfections of human nature and the inherent desire to "grasp at power" as a rationale for this precautionary measure (Locke 76). Just as in Hobbes' case, Locke's account of the separation of powers stems directly from his interpretation of the state of nature. If there is already justice in the state of nature and the people can understand it, any government is inevitably subject to the same natural law. Since absolute power over people violates both limitations of this law, separating and distributing it is advisable so that the government would function appropriately.<br/><br/>This paper has demonstrated that, while the differences between Hobbes' and Locke's accounts of the natural state of humanity are numerous, they ultimately amount to the presence of absence of moral premises. Hobbes views the natural state as that of unlimited liberty, where people endowed with equal capabilities and not bound by any moral notions, such as justice, compete for the resources unceasingly. Locke, however, interprets equality and liberty ethically rather than practically and opines that war is a perversion of the natural state, as the natural law obliges humans not to harm each other. This disagreement influences the philosophers' approaches to government. Hobbes insists on an all-powerful ruler, as, in the absence of ethical restraints, no other authority could force the humans to refrain from harming each other. Yet, in Locke's view, granting the government unlimited powers would be contradictory to the ethical limitations embedded in the law of nature, which is why he, unlike Hobbes, advocates separation of powers. | Hobbes vs. Lockeov račun o stanju prirode<br/><br/>Tema: FilozofijaRiječi: 2539Stranice: 9Aug 3rd, 2021<br/><br/>Hobbes i Locke su među najutjecajnijim političkim filozofima koji su ikada pisali na engleskom jeziku. Stanje prirode, koje prethodi organizaciji složenih društava, uobičajena je pretpostavka da i Hobbes i Locke dijele, ali tumače na različite načine. Bivši vidi ljude u njihovom prirodnom stanju kao jednako opasne i slobodne da slijede svoje sebične ciljeve, neograničene nepostojećim pojmovima pravde, zbog čega se njegovo prirodno stanje svodi na "rat svakog čovjeka protiv svakog čovjeka" (Hobbes, 76). Potonji, s druge strane, vidi ljude u njihovom izvornom stanju kao jednako vrijedne i ograničava prirodnu slobodu idejom pravde koja zahtijeva da se ne šteti drugima, što omogućuje definiranje stanja prirode kao "uzajamne pomoći i očuvanja", a ne rata (Locke 15). Ključna razlika između dvaju filozofa o prirodnom stanju je da Locke koristi etička razmatranja, dok Hobbes ne, i to u konačnici vodi Hobbesu da zamisli državu koja ima neograničenu vlast nad ljudskim bićima, dok Locke ograničava vladu moralnim načelima, koja on smatra prirodnim zakonom.<br/><br/>Hobbes svoje pretpostavke o stanju prirode temelji na činjenici da su svi ljudi otprilike jednaki u svojim fizičkim i mentalnim sposobnostima. On priznaje da neki pojedinci mogu pokazati veću fizičku snagu ili nadmoćni intelekt, ali inzistira da "kada se sve računa zajedno, razlika između čovjeka i čovjeka nije toliko značajna" (Hobbes 74). Budući da su ljudi otprilike jednaki u svojim sposobnostima, oni također imaju slične nade da postignu svoje ciljeve i zadovolje svoje potrebe (Hobbes 75). Kao logičan ishod te jednakosti, kada se ljudi počnu natjecati za oskudne resurse, nitko se ne može osjećati potpuno sigurnim u svojoj imovini. Čak i ako moćna, lukava i sposobna osoba uspije pokoriti "osobe svih ljudi koje može", ona još uvijek ne jamči krajnju sigurnost (Hobbes 75). Budući da nijedan čovjek ne može steći takvu superiornost nad drugima koja ga čini potpuno imunim na njihovu snagu intelekta, nijedan se čovjek ne može osjećati potpuno sigurnim kada je okružen svojim jednakima. Hobbesova jednakost u prirodnom stanju je jednakost straha, gdje svi ljudi vide jedni druge kao opasne konkurente.<br/><br/>Baš kao i Hobbes, Locke smatra da su sva ljudska bića u osnovi jednaka, ali pripisuje vrlo različito značenje izrazu. Iz njegove perspektive, to nije jednakost sposobnosti, nego, prije, jednakost vrijednosti. On smatra da bi ljudi "promiskuitetno rođeni iz istih prednosti prirode" trebali logično uživati savršenu jednakost među njima, jer nema razloga smatrati nekoga inherentno vrijednijim (Locke 8). Jedini mogući temelj za određivanje nekih ljudi kao superiornih nad drugima bio bi ako bi Bog "svakom jasnom izjavom svoje volje postavio jednoga iznad drugoga" (Locke 8). Budući da takvo božansko odobrenje superiornosti nije prisutno, Locke zaključuje da se prirodna jednakost svih predstavnika čovječanstva ne smije dovoditi u pitanje. Hobbes pristupa jednakosti pragmatično i naglašava da su ljudi u svom prirodnom stanju jednako opasni, ali Locke primjenjuje etički pristup i naglašava da su ljudi jednako vrijedni u Božjim očima. Ovo neslaganje je samo prva razlika između dva autora na temelju činjenice da Locke uključuje Boga kao premisu u svojoj političkoj filozofiji, dok Hobbes ne.<br/><br/>Još jedna karakteristična značajka Hobbesovog prikaza prirodnog stanja je njegovo tumačenje slobode. Prema Hobbesu, stanje prirode podrazumijeva neograničenu slobodu da radi sve što je potrebno za nastavak postojanja. Filozof definira slobodu kao "odsutnost vanjskih prepreka" u korištenju svojih sposobnosti za postizanje svojih ciljeva (Hobbes 79). Primarna svrha svakog osjetilnog bića je održavanje njegovog kontinuiranog postojanja. Kao posljedica toga, hobbesovska sloboda svodi se na neometanu priliku da se učini sve što bi, po vlastitom sudu, bilo najprikladnije za očuvanje vlastitog života i imovine (Hobbes 79). Jedino ograničenje slobode jest da osoba ne može učiniti ništa proturječno održavanju vlastitog života ili uništavanju "sredstava za njegovo očuvanje" (Hobbes 79). Osim toga, ne postoje granice, i svatko ima "pravo na sve, čak i na tijelo drugoga", ako to unapređuje nečije preživljavanje (Hobbes 80). Dakle, prirodna sloboda, kako ju je Hobbes promatrao, je odsutnost vanjsko nametnutih prepreka u ostvarivanju nečijeg prava na sve kako bi se održala i osigurala njegova kontinuirana egzistencija.<br/><br/>Locke također podržava ideju prirodne slobode, ali, ne iznenađuje, pristupa joj na način koji se bitno razlikuje od Hobbesovog. Čim počne raspravljati o slobodi u prirodnom stanju, odmah napominje da stanje slobode ne izjednačava "stanje dozvole" (Locke 9). Filozof identificira dva specifična ograničenja ljudske slobode u prirodnom stanju. Prva je identična onoj koju je uveo Hobbes: koliko god da je slobodan i neovisan, osoba ipak "nema slobodu da se uništi" (Locke 9). Ipak, drugo ograničenje izravno proturječi Hobbesovim prijedlozima. Prema Lockeu, svako ljudsko biće ima prirodnu obvezu da "ne povrijedi drugoga u svom životu, zdravlju, slobodi ili posjedu" (9). Kao i u svom tumačenju jednakosti, autor tu tvrdnju temelji na etičkim i vjerskim temeljima: ljudi trebaju čuvati egzistenciju jedni drugih, budući da su svi stvorenja istog "svemoćnog i beskrajno mudrog tvorca" (Locke 9). Dakle, Lockeova sloboda u prirodnom stanju mnogo je stroža od Hobbesove, uvodeći obvezu suzdržavanja od nanošenja štete sebi i drugima.<br/><br/>Razlike između dva autora također se očituju u njihovim izvještajima o pravdi u prirodnom stanju čovječanstva. Što se Hobbesova tiče, ocrtavanje pravednih i nepravednih praksi samo je pitanje zakona. U prirodi ne postoji nikakva sudska praksa, a jedini zakon kojim se uređuju ljudska bića u njihovom izvornom stanju je prirodni zakon koji ih obvezuje samo da traže osobnu sigurnost. Kao rezultat toga, ništa ne može biti nepravedno u izvornom stanju čovječanstva: "pojmovi o ispravnoj i pogrešnoj pravdi i nepravdi" nemaju mjesta i smisla u odsustvu strogo primijenjenog zakona. Sve dok ljudi koriste svoju gotovo neograničenu slobodu da se nemilosrdno natječu jedni s drugima za resurse na koje imaju jednako pravo, nemaju kriterije za razlikovanje pravednih i nepravednih postupaka. Stoga, Hobbesovo stanje prirode prkosi samoj ideji pravde budući da je autor tumači kao puku funkciju formaliziranog i utvrđenog zakona.<br/><br/>Locke pripisuje različito značenje pravdi i gleda na nju ne toliko u zakonodavnom, koliko u etičkom smislu. Ovaj rad je već spomenuo da, za razliku od Hobbesa, Locke koristi etičke pojmove i općenito temelji svoju političku filozofiju na moralnim, a ne isključivo praktičnim pretpostavkama. Lockeov prirodni zakon, za razliku od Hobbesovog, obvezuje ljudska bića da se brinu jedni o drugima umjesto da jednostavno ostavljaju sve da se brinu za sebe. Kao rezultat toga, u njegovom prirodnom stanju postoji mjesto za pravdu i nepravdu. Sam autor ukazuje na tu činjenicu kad napominje da nitko ne smije lišiti drugoga njegova života sredstava za njegovo očuvanje "osim ako se radi o pravdi nad prijestupnikom" (Locke 9). Ova izjava otkriva s najvećom jasnoćom da, prema Lockeu, postoji pravda u stanju prirode, i, štoviše, ljudi je moraju aktivno čuvati. Kriterij pravde, kojeg Hobbesovo prirodno stanje nema, drugo je ograničenje prirodne slobode koje je nametnuo Locke: djelo je nepravedno ako predstavlja neopravdanu prijetnju životu i imovini druge osobe.<br/><br/>Te razlike u postupanju dvaju autora o jednakosti, slobodi i pravdi ili nepravdi kulminiraju u njihovom tumačenju odnosa između stanja prirode i stanja rata. Iz Hobbesove perspektive, ta su dva sinonima, jer je nemilosrdna konkurencija jedini logičan ishod stavljanja ljudi s jednakim sposobnostima i sličnim potrebama u okruženje s ograničenim resursima. Izravno izjavljuje tu vezu: "ako neka dvojica ljudi žele istu stvar, koju ipak ne mogu oboje uživati, postaju neprijatelji" i stoga su u stanju rata jedni s drugima (Hobbes 75). Ipak, budući da su ljudi brojni i svi imaju slične sposobnosti i potrebe, to se natjecanje očituje ne samo u pojedinačnim interakcijama, već i na razini čovječanstva u cjelini. Sve dok svi ljudi imaju jednaka i neograničena prava na sve resurse, pa čak i na međusobna tijela i živote, stanje prirode je rat "svaki čovjek protiv svakog čovjeka" (Hobbes, 76). Ovo sumorno tumačenje proizlazi izravno iz Hobbesovog prikaza stanja prirode koje je uređeno isključivo egoističkim nagonima pojedinaca.<br/><br/>Locke, s druge strane, razlikuje stanje prirode i stanje rata i ističe da, iako se mogu pojaviti istodobno, nema razloga da se poistovjećuju jedno s drugim. Lockeova definicija ratnog stanja praktički je identična onoj koju je ponudio Hobbes. Prema Lockeu, "onaj tko pokušava dovesti drugog čovjeka u njegovu apsolutnu vlast, time se stavlja u stanje rata s njim" (14). Ovo objašnjenje savršeno se poklapa s Hobbesovom idejom da svačije univerzalno pravo na sve, uključujući tijela i živote drugih ljudi, vodi u ratno stanje. Ipak, Locke odbija izjednačiti stanje rata i stanje prirode upravo zato što negira Hobbesovu interpretaciju prirodne slobode. Budući da Lockeovo prirodno stanje sprječava ljude da nanose jedni drugima štetu kroz drugo ograničenje slobode, pokušaj narušavanja slobode druge osobe je prekršaj protiv prirodnog zakona. Dok je za Hobbesa rat po defaultu stanje čovječanstva, Locke ga opisuje kao perverziju stanja prirode, a ne kao njegovu vladavinu.<br/><br/>Te razlike u ocrtavanju države o prirodi i njezinim sastavnim dijelovima, kao što su sloboda, jednakost, pravda i rat, utiru put autorima suprotstavljenim prikazima vlasti. Na temelju svoje pesimistične procjene stanja prirode, autor Leviathan zaključuje da, u uvjetima rata, ne može postojati određena nada za "živjeti vrijeme koje priroda obično dopušta ljudima da žive" (Hobbes 80). Rješenje je utvrđivanje univerzalnog prava na sve i ostavljanje svima "toliko slobode protiv drugih ljudi, koliko bi on dopustio drugim ljudima protiv sebe" (Hobbes 80). Sudionici rezultirajućeg društvenog ugovora ulažu neograničene slobode koje su se predali u suverena – nositelja vrhovne vlasti čija je svrha očuvanje postignutog statusa quo kažnjavanjem svih prekršaja protiv njega. Suverena vlast je apsolutna: vladar ima vlast "činiti sve što smatra potrebnim" kako bi promicao mir među svojim podanicima, kako nitko ne bi napao tuđi život ili imovinu. Hobbes zaključuje da bez takve neosporne figure koja ima pravo učiniti bilo što podanicima, ne može biti mira i jamstva sigurnosti.<br/><br/>Iako se Locke slaže s nužnošću stvaranja politički organiziranih društava, on se ipak suprotstavlja Hobbesovoj ideji suverene moći kao neograničene i nepobjedive. Kao što je gore spomenuto, Lockeovo stanje prirode nije ni približno tako strašno kao ono koje je naslikao Hobbes zbog obveze ljudi da očuvaju ne samo sebe nego i jedni druge. Stoga potreba za društvenim ugovorom ne proizlazi iz straha od drugih, već iz same praktičnosti. Male zajednice možda ne trebaju brojne zakone za rješavanje sukoba i "službenike da nadgledaju proces", ali veća udruženja smatraju da je poželjno uspostaviti vlade u tu svrhu (Locke 57). Ipak, moć vlade ne može biti neograničena jer bi rezultirala podvrgavanjem podanika "nestalnoj, nesigurnoj, nepoznatoj, samovoljnoj volji drugog čovjeka" (Locke 17). Takva bi vlada predstavljala dvostruko kršenje prirodnog zakona. Prihvaćajući apsolutnu vlast druge osobe nad svojim životom, subjekt bi prekršio svoje prvo ograničenje koje zabranjuje samoozljeđivanje. Što se tiče vladara, uništavanje slobode druge osobe predstavljalo bi izravnu štetu i, kao takva, bilo bi u suprotnosti s drugim ograničenjem.<br/><br/>Kao izravni nastavak svog slučaja za neograničenu vladinu vlast, Hobbes negira podjelu vlasti kao načelo. Iz njegove perspektive, suveren, jednom uspostavljen, posjeduje "svu moć propisivanja pravila" koja upravlja životima podanika ili, kraće rečeno, zakonodavnu vlast (Hobbes 114). Suveren također zadržava pravo "saslušanja i odlučivanja o svim kontroverzama" - to jest pravosudne vlasti (Hobbes 114). Konačno, budući da je cjelokupna svrha suverena prisiliti podanike da se suzdrže od nanošenja štete jedni drugima, ne može biti sumnje da je izvršna vlast također njegova isključiva prerogativa. Razdvajanje vlasti kao koncept je strano Hobbesu zbog njegovih stavova o stanju prirode. Stvaranje političkog entiteta u kojem bi se izvršna, zakonodavna i sudska grana međusobno provjeravale – to jest, natjecale – značilo bi ponovno stvaranje hobbesovskog stanja prirode kao rata na višoj razini. Budući da ljudi ulaze u društveni ugovor i uspostavljaju vladu kako bi stavili stanje prirode iza sebe, a ne da ga ponovno uspostavljaju u drugom obliku, Hobbesovo razdvajanje vlasti izravno proturječi stavovima.<br/><br/>Locke, s druge strane, prihvaća razdvajanje vlasti kao temeljno načelo svoje političke teorije. Njegov slučaj za razdvajanje vidljiv je u raspravi o granicama zakonodavne vlasti. Kao što Locke kaže, bilo bi teško poželjno "da iste osobe, koje imaju moć donošenja zakona, imaju i moć da ih izvrše" (76). Filozof upućuje na nesavršenosti ljudske naravi i urođenu želju da se "uhvati za vlast" kao razlog za tu mjeru predostrožnosti (Locke 76). Kao i u Hobbesovom slučaju, Lockeov izvještaj o razdvajanju moći proizlazi izravno iz njegove interpretacije stanja prirode. Ako već postoji pravda u prirodi i ljudi to mogu razumjeti, svaka vlada neizbježno podliježe istom prirodnom zakonu. Budući da apsolutna vlast nad ljudima krši oba ograničenja ovog zakona, razdvajanje i distribucija je preporučljivo kako bi vlada funkcionirala na odgovarajući način.<br/><br/>Ovaj rad je pokazao da, iako su razlike između Hobbesovih i Lockeovih izvještaja o prirodnom stanju čovječanstva brojne, one u konačnici iznose prisutnost odsutnosti moralnih pretpostavki. Hobbes vidi prirodno stanje kao stanje neograničene slobode, gdje se ljudi obdareni jednakim sposobnostima i nevezani nikakvim moralnim pojmovima, kao što je pravda, neprestano natječu za resurse. Locke, međutim, tumači jednakost i slobodu etički, a ne praktično, i smatra da je rat perverzija prirodnog stanja, jer prirodni zakon obvezuje ljude da ne nanose jedni drugima štetu. Hobbes inzistira na svemoćnom vladaru, jer, u nedostatku etičkih ograničenja, nijedan drugi autoritet ne može prisiliti ljude da se suzdrže od nanošenja štete jedni drugima. Ipak, prema Lockeovom mišljenju, davanje neograničenih ovlasti vladi bilo bi u suprotnosti s etičkim ograničenjima ugrađenim u zakon prirode, zbog čega se on, za razliku od Hobbesa, zalaže za razdvajanje vlasti. |
| Fashion Police: What Game of Thrones threw up<br/><br/>Canadian-French singer Abbas Hasan put blinding effort to outshine all of humanity at Fashion Parade 2014. Nothing wrong with that, except safety is priority and the musician is a health hazard here.<br/><br/>We get he wants to be a star. Sadly, he didn't get the memo where they tell the desperate and the infamous that stardom is a metaphor. You don't have to look like one and literally set our sight ablaze. Also, the All Pakistan Aunty Association has officially lodged a complaint against him. The local market has run dry of fake crystals and sequined monstrosities. They have nothing to wear to their biweekly high teas and they claim he is to blame. Apparently, the outfit is inspired by Game of Thrones. Can he please stick to composing sad songs about his neighbour's dead dog instead of conceptualising outfits? Or maybe it's the trauma of losing the dog, whose death he is clearly not over as he is still wearing its carcass.<br/><br/>The charge sheet Outfit<br/><br/>No one can decide where the outfit begins and where Abbas ends. You stare in fascination, sinking into a deep abyss and wonder why he is wearing leather pants. Whose horse did he kill to steal the saddle draped across his shoulders? Was he in prison right before his red carpet appearance and forgot to take off the chains? How will he survive the synthetic leather and post-sequin rash that is bound to be lethal in such high dosage? Why am I still alive?<br/><br/>Idea<br/><br/>His inspiration was seemingly Game of Thrones, but he eventually ended up looking like he was thrown out of a Viking restaurant. Had he come across any of the characters from the show, he would've been slain in the first five seconds of the first episode.<br/><br/>The mental health or lack thereof: Someone get him to a counsellor ASAP! He seems to be under the assumption that wearing a dead dog means that the only friend he had in his life is still alive. Dear Abbas:<br/><br/>1. Denial is not a river in Egypt<br/><br/>2. Your tortured psyche is not helping your music, so get help<br/><br/>3. Try imaginary friends<br/><br/>Bail out!<br/><br/>All of us at the Fashion Police headquarters are severely traumatised. Abbas is someone we did not enjoy arresting. He is currently in custody and attempting revenge by putting on attires from other fantasy shows. He just glitter glued himself in order to look like Edward Cullen from Twilight. As a public service message and to prevent further nervous breakdowns, we gave him the following examples of men from the red carpet of the same event.<br/><br/>Zohaib Hassan<br/><br/>When in doubt, play it safe. The singer looks like your average uncle at a shaadi. A plain black suit with no accessories, even if it's a tad disproportionate, is workable. Zohaib's look is blended into everything and nothing, and when you don't have a fashion sense or the money to hire a stylist, this is okay. It does not carry the risk of cardiac arrest for fellow attendees at an event. Given Abbas' delicate mental condition, this look is what he should aim for. Always and forever.<br/><br/>Ali Zafar<br/><br/>One day, after decades of therapy, Abbas could aspire to wear attire like Ali Zafar's. The dapper summer look is done to near perfection. Ali came really close to looking like a maître d at a French restaurant with his white summer jacket with black lapels, but the shirt saves it, never mind the satin. His pants would have been ridiculous had they not been folded at the ankles. The shoes are what hipster chic happy endings are made of. | Modna policija: Što je Igra prijestolja povraćala<br/><br/>Kanadsko-francuski pjevač Abbas Hasan stavio je zasljepljujući napor da zasjeni cijelo čovječanstvo na Fashion Parade 2014. Ništa loše u tome, osim što je sigurnost prioritet, a glazbenik je ovdje opasnost po zdravlje.<br/><br/>On želi biti zvijezda. Nažalost, nije dobio dopis u kojem očajnim i zloglasnim kažu da je zvijezda metafora. Ne morate izgledati kao zvijezda i doslovno nam zapaliti vid. Također, All Pakistan Aunty Association službeno je podnio pritužbu protiv njega. Lokalno tržište je presušilo od lažnih kristala i šljokica monstruoznosti. Oni nemaju što nositi na svojim dvotjednim visokim čajevima i tvrde da je on kriv. Očigledno, odjeća je inspirirana Igrom prijestolja. Može li se, molim vas, držati tužnih pjesama o mrtvom psu svog susjeda umjesto konceptualiziranja odjeće? Ili možda je to trauma gubitka psa, čija smrt očito nije gotova jer još uvijek nosi leš.<br/><br/>Naplatni list Odjeća<br/><br/>Nitko ne može odlučiti gdje počinje odjeća i gdje Abbas završava. Vi buljite u fascinaciju, tonete u duboki ponor i pitate se zašto nosi kožne hlače. Čijeg je konja ubio da bi ukrao sedlo prekriveno preko ramena? Je li bio u zatvoru neposredno prije pojave crvenog tepiha i zaboravio skinuti lance? Kako će preživjeti sintetičku kožu i osip nakon šljokica koji će biti smrtonosan u tako visokoj dozi? Zašto sam još uvijek živ?<br/><br/>Ideja<br/><br/>Njegova inspiracija naizgled je bila Igra prijestolja, ali na kraju je izgledao kao da je izbačen iz vikinškog restorana. Da je naišao na bilo koji od likova iz serije, bio bi ubijen u prvih pet sekundi prve epizode.<br/><br/>Mentalno zdravlje ili nedostatak toga: Netko ga odvesti do savjetnika ASAP! Čini se da je pod pretpostavkom da nosi mrtvog psa znači da je jedini prijatelj koji je imao u svom životu je još uvijek živ. Dragi Abbas:<br/><br/>1. Poricanje nije rijeka u Egiptu<br/><br/>2. Vaša mučena psiha ne pomaže vašoj glazbi, pa potražite pomoć<br/><br/>3. Pokušajte imaginarne prijatelje<br/><br/>Izvucite se!<br/><br/>Svi smo u sjedištu Modne policije teško traumatizirani. Abbas je netko koga nismo uživali u uhićenju. Trenutno je u pritvoru i pokušava se osvetiti oblačenjem odjeće iz drugih fantasy emisija. Samo se zalijepio kako bi izgledao kao Edward Cullen iz Sumraka. Kao poruka javne službe i kako bismo spriječili daljnje živčane slomove, dali smo mu sljedeće primjere muškaraca s crvenog tepiha istog događaja.<br/><br/>Zohaib Hassan<br/><br/>Kad ste u nedoumici, igrajte na sigurno. Pjevačica izgleda kao vaš prosječni ujak u shaadi. Obično crno odijelo bez pribora, čak i ako je malo nesrazmjerno, izvedivo je. Zohaibov izgled je uklopljen u sve i ništa, a kada nemate smisao za modu ili novac za unajmljivanje stilista, to je u redu. To ne nosi rizik od srčanog zastoja za kolege sudionike na događaju. S obzirom na Abbasovo osjetljivo mentalno stanje, ovaj pogled bi trebao biti cilj.<br/><br/>Ali Zafar<br/><br/>Jednog dana, nakon desetljeća terapije, Abbas bi mogao težiti da nosi odjeću poput Alija Zafara. Ali je bio vrlo blizu da izgleda kao maestro d u francuskom restoranu s bijelom ljetnom jaknom s crnim reverima, ali košulja ga štedi, a kamoli saten. Njegove hlače bi bile smiješne da nisu presavijene na gležnjeve. Cipele su ono što hipster chic sretan završetak su izrađeni od. |
| Determining soil hydraulic properties with different wetting liquids : A thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the Degree of Master of Science at Lincoln University<br/><br/>Abstract<br/><br/>Soil hydraulic properties such as hydraulic conductivity, water retention and plant water relationships dominate the water movement processes. For example, the infiltration, evaporation and water flow within the soil. As a widespread phenomenon in soil, soil water repellency alters the soil hydraulic functions by resisting the water flow into the soils. Moreover, the hydraulic properties not only depend on the pore system of soil but also are affected by the physicochemical properties of the pore surfaces. Compared to water, ethanol is not affected by the water repellency due to its lower surface tension. The purpose of using ethanol is to eliminate the effect of soil water repellency on hydraulic properties measurements. However, applying pure ethanol into natural soil can degrade the soil organic materials and lead to changes in physical properties. Therefore, the aqueous ethanol solutions can be an alternative option. Nevertheless, the feasibility of using aqueous ethanol for determining soil liquid retention curve remains unknown. This study aims to test the feasibility of the aqueous ethanol solutions (0, 10 %, 20 %, 30 %, 40 %, 50 % and 100 % v/v) for establishing liquid retention curve under a small range of applied pressure in coarse sand samples with different wettability and organic amended natural soil (Templeton silt loam (TSL) with mushroom compost, biochar, dairy effluent, and municipal compost, the application rate was 15 % by weight). The result showed that the desorption of testing aqueous ethanol solutions compared to water was quicker by approximately 1 to 3x based on the liquid content at the same applied pressure and the time for reaching each equilibrium. The outcomes from the sand experiment suggested that when the concentration of aqueous ethanol solution was below 50 %, the losses via evaporation were less than 1% and the relative differences between testing liquid and water was lower than 10 %. However, the evaporation losses were 11.06 % and 24.6 %, and the relative differences were all around 15 % and 30 % in 50 % and 100 % ethanol solution, respectively. In contrast, the organic amendments in Templeton silt loam not only increased the water retention capability but also reduced the evaporation losses. The evaporation losses in TSL soil and TSL with organic amendments soil were with 1 % in solutions with less than 50 % ethanol content. Evaporation losses of 50 % and 100 % ethanol were 2.8 % and 2.9 %, respectively. The relative differences between water and testing liquid were similar to the sand experiment when the testing liquid concentrations were below 50 %. However, the relative differences in 50 % and 100 % ethanol solution were smaller than in the sand sample with around 10 % and 15%, respectively. Additionally, the analysis of relative difference suggested that almost all aqueous ethanol solutions had lower volumetric liquid content at the same supplied pressure compared to water, which was a reflection of the aqueous ethanol solutions desorbed faster than water under equivalent pressure. Therefore, 10 % to 40 % of ethanol solutions could be considered an alternative for determining soil hydraulic properties due to their faster desorption rate and not being affected by soil water repellency. Due to the evaporation and dissolution of organic material, aqueous ethanol solutions above 50% concentration were not suitable for coarse sand or medium-textured soil.... [Show full abstract] | Utvrđivanje hidrauličkih svojstava tla s različitim tekućinama za vlaženje : Diplomski rad podnesen u djelomičnom ispunjavanju zahtjeva za magisterij znanosti na Sveučilištu Lincoln<br/><br/>Sažetak<br/><br/>Hidraulička svojstva tla kao što su hidraulička vodljivost, zadržavanje vode i odnosi biljnih voda dominiraju procesima kretanja vode. Na primjer, infiltracija, isparavanje i protok vode unutar tla. Kao raširena pojava u tlu, odbojnost vode u tlu mijenja hidrauličke funkcije tla tako što se opire protoku vode u tlo. Osim toga, hidraulička svojstva ne ovise samo o sustavu pora tla, već i na njih utječu fizikalno-kemijska svojstva površina pora. U usporedbi s vodom, na etanol ne utječe vodoodbojnost zbog niže površinske napetosti. Svrha upotrebe etanola je eliminirati učinak odbojnosti vode u tlu na mjerenja hidrauličnih svojstava. Međutim, primjena čistog etanola u prirodno tlo može degradirati organske materijale tla i dovesti do promjena u fizikalnim svojstvima. Stoga, vodene otopine etanola mogu biti alternativa. Ipak, izvedivost korištenja vodenog etanola za određivanje krivulje zadržavanja tekućine u tlu ostaje nepoznata. Cilj ovog istraživanja je ispitati izvedivost vodenih otopina etanola (0, 10 %, 20 %, 30 %, 40 %, 50 % i 100 % v/v) za utvrđivanje krivulje zadržavanja tekućine pod malim rasponom primijenjenog tlaka u uzorcima grubog pijeska s različitom ovlaživošću i organski modificiranim prirodnim tlom (Templeton mulj (TSL) s kompostom od gljiva, bio je 15 %, bio kompost, bio je bio bio bio bio bio bio bio je bio i mlije. Rezultat je pokazao da je desorpcija ispitivanih vodenih otopina etanola u usporedbi s vodom bila brža za približno 1 do 3x na temelju sadržaja tekućine pri istom primijenjenom tlaku i vremena postizanja svake ravnoteže. Rezultati eksperimenta s pijeskom sugeriraju da kada je koncentracija vodene otopine etanola bila ispod 50 %, gubici isparavanjem bili su manji od 1 %, a relativne razlike između ispitivane tekućine i vode bile su manje od 10 %. Međutim, gubici isparavanja iznosili su 11,06 % i 24,6 %, a relativne razlike iznosile su oko 15 % i 30 % u otopini etanola od 50 % odnosno 100 %. Suprotno tome, organske izmjene u mulju Templeton ne samo da su povećale sposobnost zadržavanja vode, već su i smanjile gubitke isparavanja. Gubici isparavanja u TSL tlu i TSL tlu s organskim modifikacijama iznosili su 1 % u otopinama s udjelom etanola manjim od 50 %. Gubici isparavanja od 50 % i 100 % etanola iznosili su 2,8 % odnosno 2,9 %. Relativne razlike između vode i ispitne tekućine bile su slične pokusu s pijeskom kada su ispitne koncentracije tekućine bile ispod 50 %. Međutim, relativne razlike u 50 % i 100 % otopini etanola bile su manje nego u uzorku pijeska s oko 10 % odnosno 15 %. Osim toga, analiza relativne razlike pokazala je da gotovo sve vodene otopine etanola imaju niži volumenski sadržaj tekućine pri istom isporučenom tlaku u usporedbi s vodom, što je odraz vodene otopine etanola koja se desorbira brže od vode pod ekvivalentnim tlakom. Stoga se 10 % do 40 % otopina etanola može smatrati alternativom za određivanje hidrauličnih svojstava tla zbog njihove brže desorpcije i zbog toga što na njih ne utječe odbojnost vode u tlu. Zbog isparavanja i otapanja organskog materijala, vodene otopine etanola iznad 50% koncentracije nisu bile prikladne za grubi pijesak ili tlo srednje teksture.... [Prikaži cijeli sažetak] |
