| Smith Chuck - Through the Bible C2000 SeriesShall we turn to the book of Acts, chapter one, as we begin our study of the early church.<br/>Luke, the author of the book of Acts, a companion of Paul the apostle, who was author also of the Gospel According to Luke, wrote these two treatises to a friend, Theophilus. Theophilus is a Greek name. It's a name that has a beautiful meaning. The name means lover of God. There are some who believe that it was not a man at all, but that the gospel and the book of Acts were addressed to the lovers of God, whoever you may be. There are other traditions that say that Theophilus was actually Luke's master. That in those days physicians were slaves, usually the slave of a wealthy patron. So that Luke's master was Theophilus, and he released Luke to be with Paul on the missionary journeys. Thus, Luke is writing back to his former master. This is an early tradition of the church, but it is, of course, impossible to prove, like so many of the traditions.<br/>There are also those who believe that when Paul was in Troas and he received a vision of a man calling unto him saying, "Come over to Macedonia and help us," that that man in Paul's vision was none other than Luke. For the first one that Paul really met when he came to Macedonia was Luke. And as we are in the book of Acts, you will find that when we get to that portion of the book of Acts, Luke begins to write more in the first person rather than the third person. So it is, evidently, at this particular point in the Acts of the Apostles that Luke became a companion of Paul and began to journey with him. He began to use the pronouns "we" and "us" instead of "they" and "them." This is, no doubt, where Luke became a participant and an eyewitness of those things that were happening from this point on. We will bring this out to you when we get to that point.<br/>He begins the Acts of the Apostles by tying it with the Gospel According to Luke. It is interesting that the very last thing that Luke records in his gospel is the very first thing he records in the Acts of the Apostles. We find the gospel of Luke closing as Jesus is telling His disciples to wait in Jerusalem until they be endued with power from on high. And then Jesus ascended up into heaven, and so he closes the gospel. In opening the Acts of the Apostles, he writes,<br/>The former treatise [that is, the Gospel According to Luke,] have I written unto you, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and teach ( Act 1:1 ),<br/>The key word is began. The Gospel According to Luke is not the full story of the ministry of Jesus Christ. It is only the beginning of the ministry of Jesus Christ. Jesus continues to minister to the needs of people. Jesus continues to heal the sick. Jesus continues to raise the dead. Jesus continues to minister His love and His gospel to the world, only now He is ministering through those disciples who have been anointed with His Holy Spirit. But the ministry of Christ is continuing; basically, is the premise that Luke takes in the Acts of the Apostles. The former treatise of all that Jesus began, both to do and to teach.<br/>Now because of that, the Acts of the Apostles is an unfinished book: in that the Lord today continues to work through the lives of those who have dedicated themselves to be the instruments of God. To be led and guided and anointed by His Holy Spirit, to continue the ministry of Jesus in the world today. Now God has ordained that His work should be accomplished through human instruments. I do not say that it must be accomplished. God can use angelic beings for His work, and there will come a time, during the book of Revelation when God will use angels to proclaim His gospel to people all over the world. Revelation, chapter 14, "The first angel flying through the midst of heaven having the everlasting gospel" ( Rev 14:6 ). But at the present time, God has chosen to use human instruments. As imperfect as they may be, yet that's what God has ordained to use. The exciting thing about that is, God will use me and God will use you. So many times, we're begging off, "O Lord, I can't speak. I've never been able to speak before or even now, Lord." As Moses tried to beg off the call of God. Jeremiah said, "Lord, I'm just a kid; no one's going to listen to me." And we all have our excuses why we can't be used. Don't we? We all know the reasons why God couldn't use us.<br/>One time, as the Lord was calling a prophet to do His work, he said, "Lord, send whoever you want." The Lord said, "Hey, I've called you." "Lord, good idea; send whoever you want." So often we're in that position, "Lord, send by the hand of whomsoever you will, anybody but me Lord." And yet, God has ordained to use us.<br/>Now, each of us can show our own imperfections. Each of us can point out our own inabilities, and all of us can find an excuse why God wouldn't want to use me. But yet, God has chosen to use you. That through your life He might reveal Himself to a needy world. You wonder when God has such instruments to use how He ever got the job done, don't you?<br/>Until the day in which he was taken up, after that he through the Holy Spirit had given commandments to the apostles whom he had chosen ( Act 1:2 ):<br/>That is what he ended the Gospel of Luke with. The day that Jesus was taken up, after He had told the apostles to wait for the endowment of power.<br/>To whom he also [that is the apostles he also] showed himself alive to them after his passion [or death] by many infallible proofs ( Act 1:3 ),<br/>It is difficult to deny the fact of the resurrection of Jesus Christ. I was amused, as well as annoyed and irritated, by an article I read in the Santa Ana Register this last Saturday. Of the creation science and evolutionary theories being presented in the county schools. How that, this one professor said that he teaches a science class, and thus, they deal only in facts, and that they don't have any place for theories. Because science is based upon fact and creation is based upon religious superstitions. It takes a lot of faith to believe the religious theories. When you are dealing with facts, you can just accept them. I thought, "Very interesting in that science class, they taught me it was a fact that the world was four billion years old. Now today they are teaching it's a fact that the world is twelve billion years old. And it wasn't that long ago that I went to school."<br/>It's interesting that the Bible has never needed to be revised or updated to meet the current data that men have discovered. And yet, if you would take my high school science textbooks today and try to teach a science class from them, you would find that many of the things that were taught as scientific fact when I was in high school are no longer recognized as scientific fact. The simple cell protoplasm is no longer a simple cell, but extremely complex. If there is any fact that can be attested to in history it is the fact of the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.<br/>We have a jurisprudence system that is based upon the testimony of witnesses. If a man is accused of a crime and there are people who witnessed that crime while it was being committed, and they are brought to the standard, and they swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help them God. And in their questioning they affirm that, "I saw that man in the bank on May twenty-third. I saw him pull out a gun from his coat. I heard him demand that all of the money be given to him. I saw him as he left the bank. I saw him as the officer apprehended him outside." And if you can get three or four witnesses to point to that man and will keep their testimony under cross-examination, that man is judged to be guilty. He is the one who did it. We have two or three witnesses that are testifying the same story about that man, and it is accepted as fact that he is the one who perpetrated the crime and is guilty. You've got witnesses who have sworn to tell the truth that are verifying.<br/>After the death of Jesus, when He rose again, He appeared unto many different people who gave sworn testimony that they saw Him. That they talked to Him, that He appeared to them in various places under different circumstances. And for a period of forty days was visiting with them. And at one time, up to as many as five hundred people who were gathered at one place, He appeared. It's difficult to just cast aside or deny the witness of these people. To do so is to discredit our whole jurisprudence system. But not only that, these men who testified that they saw the risen Lord, that they talked to Him, that they ate with Him, they, all of them, with the exception of one, met violent deaths at the hands of other people because of their affirming that the story they told was true. You talk about witnesses sworn to tell the truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth. If a person's life was threatened because of that witness, and it was a lie, at least one them would've broken under the pressure. They would've confessed to the entire hoax. "He showed Himself alive after His passion by many infallible proofs."<br/>being seen of them for forty days, speaking to them of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God ( Act 1:3 ):<br/>Sometimes we fault the disciples because of their questions of the timing of the kingdom of God. Let it be remembered that the kingdom of God was the favorite subject of Jesus Christ. He was always talking about the kingdom of God, and it is a great hope that He was planting into the hearts of all men. Things are not always going to continue corrupted as they are. The world is not going to go forever under the power of darkness, under the bondage of evil. God is going to one day establish His kingdom upon the earth. A kingdom of righteous joy and peace. "Jesus shall reign, where ere the sun doth her successive journeys run. And His kingdom will extend from shore to shore." And that day will be the most glorious day the world has ever seen, as sickness and suffering and pain will be abolished in His kingdom. As sin and greed and these things that have made the world such an intolerable place will be abolished in His kingdom. The godless commercialism, the exploitation of man, all of these things abolished in His glorious kingdom when He reigns. No wonder the disciples were anxious to get it on. I'm anxious to get it on; I'm anxious for His kingdom to come. And Jesus told us when we pray, the first petition is, "Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven" ( Mat 6:10 ). This is the right kind of a desire that we should all have. I desire the kingdom of God. And so He was talking to them, during this forty-day period, of the kingdom.<br/>And, being assembled together with them, he commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which, saith he, you have heard of me ( Act 1:4 ).<br/>He said, "Now look, wait here in Jerusalem until you receive the promise of the Father." This promise that He is referring to is, no doubt, the promise in Joel where the Lord promised, "And it shall come to pass in the later days, saith the Lord, that I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and daughters will prophesy, and your young men shall dream dreams, your old men shall see visions: and upon my servants and my handmaidens shall I pour out my Spirit, saith the Lord" ( Joe 2:28-29 ). The promise of the Father: the day is going to come when God is going to pour out His Spirit upon all flesh, all of the believers. They will, each one, receive that dynamic from God.<br/>For John [He said,] truly baptized with water; but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now ( Act 1:5 ).<br/>The idea of baptism was that of emersion, the bapteedzo. John baptized with water, submerged the people in water, "you're going to be submerged in the Holy Spirit in not many days."<br/>Now when they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, will you at this time restore the kingdom to Israel? ( Act 1:6 )<br/>"When is it going to be, Lord? When's the time for this restoration?" And Jesus is talking to them now, not about the kingdom, but about the power that they're going to receive for service. And so He brushes aside their question.<br/>Saying unto them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father has put in his own power ( Act 1:7 ).<br/>"It's not for you to know." They lived constantly in the anticipation of the immediate setting up of the kingdom. During the entire lifetime of Jesus, they were expecting Him at any moment to go into the phone booth and come out as the savior of the world. Shazzam! Showing His power and overthrowing the governments of the world, establishing God's kingdom upon the earth. And they were waiting daily for this change to transpire. And whenever Jesus would talk about going to Jerusalem, being turned over into the hands of sinful man, and then being crucified, "Oh, oh no, Lord. No, no you don't understand the kingdom, Lord. Be that far from Thee." When Jesus died on the cross, they were all greatly disappointed.<br/>The two disciples on the road to Emmaus, so sad. "Hey, fellows. How come you're so sad as your walking along?" "What do you mean? You must be a stranger around here if you don't know the things that have been happening lately in Jerusalem." "What things?" "Oh, a fellow by the name of Jesus of Nazareth...oh man, it was mighty and powerful. The anointing of God was upon His life. We had hoped that in Him was the deliverance of Israel, but they crucified Him. We had hoped . . . now it's dead." Now He's risen, and He's saying, "In a few days, fellows, you're going to receive the promise of the Father." "Oh, what promise? The promise of the establishing of the kingdom?" You see, it was legitimate that they should ask. "Is this it Lord? Alright! Is this the time? Are you going to set up your kingdom now?" "No. It's not for you to know those times that the Father's appointed or that the Father has in His own power. But, you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you."<br/>Now here, the Greek preposition epi is used to signify a new relationship that they were to have with the Holy Spirit. In the Gospel According to John, chapter 14, as Jesus is there promising to send the Holy Spirit, He said, "I will not leave you comfortless. I will come to you, and I will pray the Father, and He will send to you another comforter, even the Spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth Him not neither knows Him, but you know Him for He dwells with you, and He shall be in you" ( Joh 14:17-18 ). Same Greek preposition as ours, only they spell it "en" instead of "in." Two-fold relationship there in John: He is with you, but He's going to be dwelling in you. But now Jesus said you're going to receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you. The Greek preposition epi, which is translated in different texts throughout the New Testament as "upon" or "over" or I like it, "overflows."<br/>In the seventh chapter of the gospel of John: "On the last day, the great day of the feast when Jesus stood there on the Temple Mount and cried to the people, 'If any man thirst let him come unto Me and drink: and he who drinks of the water that I give, out of his innermost being there will gush torrents of living water.'" John said, "This spake He of the Spirit, which was not yet given which they who believe on Him should receive" ( Joh 7:37-39 ). What did He speak of the Spirit? That it would be like a torrent of living water flowing out. I like, "When the Spirit overflows you," upon you, or over you, or overflows from you. So the three-fold relationship: He is with you prior to your conversion, He is the one who causes you to realize that you are a sinner, He is the one who points to Jesus Christ as the answer as He convinces the world of sin, of righteous, and of judgment. The moment you open your life and heart to Jesus Christ and invite Him to come in, the Holy Spirit comes and begins to indwell you. He shall be in you. "Know ye not that you are not your own, you have been bought with a price, therefore glorify God in your body and your spirit which are His. And know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit which is in you? Be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess, but be filled, or be ye being filled with the Spirit" ( 1Co 6:19-20 ,Eph 5:18 ). But now here's a third relationship. This is an empowering experience.<br/>You will receive [the dunamus] the dynamics, when the Holy Spirit has come [epi] upon you [or over you, or when there is that overflow from you]: and ye shall be witnesses unto me ( Act 1:8 )<br/>And so the dynamic, to be a witness for Jesus Christ. It is interesting that the word witness in Greek is the word martus from where we get our word martyr. And in Greek it does mean martyr. A witness is one who not only proclaims what he believes, he lives what he believes, he is what he believes, and he believes it so strongly, that if necessary, he'll die for what he believes. That's how strong is his belief. He's a martus. You can't stop him. He's not afraid to die for what he believes.<br/>You remember when Paul was on his way back to Jerusalem and Agabus came down from Caesarea and he took Paul's girdle and tied himself up and he said, "So is the man who owns this girdle to be bound when he gets to Jerusalem." And Paul's friends began to weep, saying, "Oh, Paul, don't go, don't go." And he said, "What do you mean by these tears? Do you think you're going to dissuade me? Do you think I'm worried about being bound? I'm ready to die." He was a martus. "I'm ready to die." Being put to death for your faith did not make you a martyr; because you were a martyr, you were put to death. Because you were a witness, because you believed it so strong. So, it did not make you a witness, it only proved what you were. You were a witness all along. If you hadn't been a martus, you would've never gone to your death. You would've recanted; you would've said, "Whoa, whoa, wait, wait. Hold on, let's change course here. I think that I may have made a mistake." Then you say, "Well, he wasn't a martus. Stealing a horse doesn't make you a horse thief; it only proves that you were. No one steals a horse unless he's a horse thief. So, stealing it doesn't make you a horse thief, it only proves that you were all along. Being martyred only proves what you were a witness, a martus. "And you will be witnesses." And isn't it interesting that most of them were martyred? "Witnesses unto Me."<br/>The witness was to be both in Jerusalem, and in all of Judea ( Act 1:8 ),<br/>The witness began right at home. The hardest place, isn't it? It's to start right at home in Jerusalem, and then the area around Jerusalem, the area of Judea. And then it was to spread up into Samaria. And then it was to go out into the uttermost parts of the world. And as we study the book of Acts, we will see this very progression. How the witness began in Jerusalem. We'll get that in the next chapter. And then we'll see how it began to spread through out Judea. And then Phillip went up into Samaria, and then finally Paul and Barnabas are called to go into the uttermost parts of the world. And so the witness spread through the anointing and the empowering of the Holy Spirit.<br/>Now when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight ( Act 1:9 ).<br/>This is the final promise made by Jesus to His disciples. This is it, the final words prior to His ascension. Of course, later He came and talked to Paul and others, but prior to His ascension, this is His final word. And upon this, when He had spoken these things, while they were watching Him, He was taken up and a cloud received Him out of their sight.<br/>And while they were looking steadfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, there were two men who stood by them in white apparel ( Act 1:10 );<br/>We assume they were angels.<br/>Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as you have seen him go into heaven ( Act 1:11 ).<br/>They saw Him as He ascended up into heaven and they will behold Him when He comes again. "Behold the Lord cometh with ten thousands of His saints, to execute judgement upon the earth" (Jud 1:14-15). And then, "Unto Him who loved us and gave Himself for us and who has made us unto our God, kings and priests who shall reign with Him upon the earth, behold the Lord cometh, and every eye shall see Him, and they also who pierced Him shall mourn" Rev 1:5-7 ). So the Lord's coming. Every eye shall see Him. The Jehovah Witnesses say that He is already come, but it was a secret coming. As it was only the disciples that saw Him go, it was only the disciples, of the Jehovah Witnesses, who saw Him return. But Jesus said, "If they say unto you, 'He has come in secret and has gone into a secret chamber don't believe it'" ( Mat 24:26 ). So you have to choose, to believe Jesus or them.<br/>"This same Jesus which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as you've seen Him go into heaven."<br/>Now there's a very interesting verse in II John, verse Act 1:7 , "For many deceivers are entered into the world who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh." That, unfortunately, is a poor translation of the Greek. For this participle is in the present tense and should be translated "is coming in the flesh." Those who would deny that Jesus Christ is coming in the flesh. What does John say of them? "They are a deceiver and an antichrist. Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward. For whosoever transgresses and abides not in the doctrine of Christ, has not God. He that abides in the doctrine of Christ, he has both the Father and the Son. And if there come any unto your door (on Saturday morning) and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, and neither bid him good-bye. For he that bids him good-bye is a partaker of his evil deeds" (2Jn 1:7-11). Ask them one question, "Is Jesus coming in the flesh?" Just ask them that question. And if they say no, just remember what John warned you and what John told you. "If any confess not that Jesus Christ is coming in the flesh." Do you remember when He was with the disciples and He said, "Give me something to eat"? He said, "You know, spirits don't eat; touch me. See? It's me." So, this same Jesus is coming again in the same manner in which they saw Him go into heaven. And I, for one, believe that that coming is very soon.<br/>Then retuned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a Sabbath's day journey [about two-thirds of a mile]. And when they were come in, they went up into an upper room, where there abode both Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, and Phillip, and Thomas, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon Zelotes, and Judas the brother of James. And these all continued in one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers ( Act 1:12-14 ).<br/>This is the last mention of Mary the mother of Jesus. At this point and from this point on, there is no further mention of her in the Acts of the Apostles or in the epistles. No mention of her death or of her miraculous ascension into heaven, without death. Nothing is mentioned in the scripture. It is silent.<br/>His brethren would be a reference probably to James and to Jude and to those other brothers who were sons of Joseph and Mary.<br/>The upper room--there are some who say that it is the same upper room in which Jesus had the Last Supper with His disciples. And yet, there are others who hold to this upper room being a room in the temple precincts where the early church met. Take your choice.<br/>And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples, and said, (the number of their names together were about one hundred and twenty,) men and brethren, this Scripture must needs have been fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit by the mouth of David spake before concerning Judas, which was a guide to those who took Jesus ( Act 1:15-16 ).<br/>Here again, Peter still his same impetuous self. They're waiting in prayer and supplication, and Peter stands up and says, "Fellows, there's a scripture that's gotta be fulfilled." And you know he's going to move ahead, "Let's get the program going; let's cast lots and find out who's going to take Judas' place." I do feel that Peter was again in the flesh, manifesting that impetuous nature that was his. And I think that the future history of the church in the book of Acts points this out. I am interested in Peter's understanding of the scriptures, how that he is quoting from so many places in the Old Testament. Peter does manifest a very great understanding of the Old Testament scriptures which is a point in his favor.<br/>Notice that Peter ascribes to the Holy Spirit those things that David wrote. So that, "All scripture is given by inspiration of God" ( 2Ti 3:16 ). Not part of the scriptures. Because, if you tell me that part of the scriptures are given by inspiration of God, then I must ask you, "What parts are by inspiration and what parts are not by inspiration?" And then you are then the authority who tells me what part I can believe and what part I can't believe. And the minute that God is no longer the authority but you're the authority, I'm in trouble. Beware of those who say, "Well, you can't believe all of the scriptures." The scriptures themselves say, "All scripture is given by inspiration of God." And here, Luke in writing of what Peter was saying, declares that David was actually the spokesman for the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit, by the mouth of David, spake concerning Judas.<br/>For he was numbered with us, [he was one of the twelve] he had obtained a part of this ministry. But now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity; and falling headlong ( Act 1:17-18 ),<br/>He purchased the field, the potter's field as Zachariah the eleventh chapter declares.<br/>and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all of his bowels gushed out ( Act 1:18 ).<br/>There are those who find a discrepancy in the scriptures, because in one of the gospels we are told that when Judas came back and tried to return the money, and they said, "Hey, it's your problem. We can't take it." And put it back in the temple treasury. "It's blood money." Then he threw it there on the floor of the temple and he went out and hung himself. Here Peter tells us that he fell headlong and just popped. And there are those who imagine a discrepancy. Very simple, he went up into the tree to hang himself, tied the rope around his neck and tied it to the limb and jumped. And the force of the fall either snapped the rope or his head, and he fell on down into the canyon and just as he said it here.<br/>It was known to all of the dwellers at Jerusalem; insomuch that the field is called in their tongue, Aceldama, that is to say, The field of blood. For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be desolate, and let no man dwell therein: and, His bishoprick let another take ( Act 1:19-20 ).<br/>Now in reality he's quoting from two different Psalms here. From Psa 69:25 ,he puts it together with Psa 109:8 . And putting the two together he finds these prophecies concerning Judas.<br/>Wherefore of these men ( Act 1:21 )<br/>Now here is where they are looking for someone to take Judas' place to be an apostle. Here are the qualifications they looked for in that time.<br/>Wherefore of these men which have companied with us all the time that the Lord Jesus when in and out among us ( Act 1:21 ),<br/>Now you remember there were many disciples, many disciples of which Jesus chose ten to be apostles. And the word apostle means "one who is sent out." Or chose twelve to be apostles, so He sent out the twelve. The number of human government. "We only have eleven. We need one to take Judas' place, but we need one who has been with us all the while from the beginning with Jesus."<br/>From the time he was baptized by John, until the day he was taken up from us, must one be ordained to be a witness [of what?] of His resurrection ( Act 1:22 ).<br/>So these were the requirements they were looking for. Someone who had been around the whole while. From the time of John's baptism to the ascension. And one who saw the risen Lord, and thus could bear fact of the resurrection, their testimony to the fact.<br/>Now Paul the apostle, later in asserting the fact that he was an apostle said, "Have I not seen the risen Christ?" Evidently that was one of the requirements of apostleship. Someone asked me, "Are there apostles today?" Well, I don't know. I don't think that there are in the same sense that they were in the New Testament. Surely there is none today who can bear witness to the resurrection as they did.<br/>They appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias. And they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord, which knowest the hearts of all men, show whether of these two that you have chosen ( Act 1:23-24 ),<br/>I think that we often make this mistake of giving the Lord two choices, both wrong. Limiting God, you see. We're so prone to do this. Obviously, Paul was God's choice. Peter was impetuous, and jumping the gun said, "Hey, we've got to do something, you know, gotta help God out. You know, one's missing and we've got to fill him in." And yet, "God, which one of these two do you want?" And giving God the two choices.<br/>That he may take part of this ministry and this apostleship, from which Judas by the transgression fell, that he might go to his own place. And so they gave forth their lots ( Act 1:25-26 );<br/>An interesting way by which they sought to determine the will of God. Let's throw dice, find out what God's will is here. It's interesting to me, the various ways that people have devised to discern the will of God. Now, in the Old Testament times they had an interesting way of coming to the priest, who would inquire of the Lord for them through the Urim and the Thummim, the "lights and perfections." Just what these Urim and Thummim were, we don't know. I'm sure they were not the colored glasses that Joseph Smith found with the Golden Tablets; the magic glasses, that when you put them on, you could suddenly read the hieroglyphic writing.<br/>There are those who say that the Urim and Thummim were actually a black and a white stone that was worn in a pouch on the chest of the priest. They would pray and ask the Lord a particular question. You remember that David was asking the Lord definite questions: "Lord, shall we go out against the Philistines?" The answer was, "No." So again, the next day, "Lord, shall we go out against the Philistines?" The answer was, "Yes." "When shall we go?" They would ask specific questions, and the Lord would direct them through the Urim and the Thummin. They say that the priest would pray, seek God, and then reach in and pull out one of the two stones. If it was the white stone, it was a yes answer. If it was a no, then it would be the black stone that he would pull out. Some even say we get the term blackballed from this Urim and Thummim. Actually, back in the original it is a no vote against a particular project or idea. Just what the Urim and Thummim were, we don't know. But during the Old Testament period, they did use a method of casting lots to determine the will of God.<br/>So here the disciples are picking up on the same thing as they are throwing the dice to see which of the two fellows that God had chosen to replace Judas Iscariot.<br/>the lot fell on Matthias; he was numbered with the eleven ( Act 1:26 ).<br/>Now who in the world is Matthias? No one ever heard of him before or since. It'll be interesting to meet Matthias and find out who he is and what he did. I think from the subsequent history, it's obvious to assume that God chose Paul as an apostle. Paul declares it himself. Now this is the last time we ever read of them seeking to discern the will of God by the casting of lots or by a chance kind of a thing.<br/>I know a fellow today, in seeking to discern the will of the Lord, will pray and ask the Lord a question. He'll have ten pennies in his pocket, and as he's praying, he'll take the pennies with his eyes closed and put them down on the table, and if they all come up heads, it's a yes. An interesting thing, every once in a while, they'll all come up heads, and that's pretty good odds. Yet, we don't find any pattern for this after the Holy Spirit was given. Once the Holy Spirit came upon the church, then the Holy Spirit began to speak to them and direct them. And the Holy Spirit said, "Separate unto me Paul and Barnabas for the ministry where I have called them" ( Act 13:2 ). And the Holy Spirit sent them forth. So we find the church more directly guided by the Holy Spirit. Once the Holy Spirit came, this throwing dice to find out the will of God was set aside.<br/>"<br/><br/>King James Version<br/><br/>This is the 1769 King James Version of the Holy Bible (also known as the Authorized Version). "Public Domain" | Smith Chuck - Kroz Bibliju C2000 serijeHoćemo li se okrenuti knjizi Djela apostolska, poglavlje 1, dok započinjemo naše proučavanje rane crkve.<br/>Luka, autor knjige Djela apostolskih, pratitelj Pavla apostola, koji je također bio autor Evanđelja prema Luki, napisao je ova dva traktata prijatelju, Teofilu. Teofil je grčko ime. To je ime koje ima lijepo značenje. Ime znači ljubitelj Boga. Postoje neki koji vjeruju da to uopće nije bio čovjek, već da su evanđelje i knjiga Djela apostolska bili upućeni ljubiteljima Boga, tko god bili. Postoje i druge tradicije koje kažu da je Teofil zapravo bio Lukin gospodar. Da su u to vrijeme liječnici bili robovi, obično rob bogatog pokrovitelja. Tako da je Lukin učitelj bio Teofil, i on je pustio Luku da bude s Pavlom na misionarskim putovanjima. Tako Luka piše natrag svom bivšem gospodaru. To je rana tradicija Crkve, ali je, naravno, nemoguće dokazati, kao i mnoge druge tradicije.<br/>Ima i onih koji vjeruju da, dok je Pavao bio u Troadi, primi viđenje čovjeka koji ga doziva govoreći: "Dođi u Makedoniju i pomozi nam", da taj čovjek u Pavlovom viđenju nije bio nitko drugi nego Luka. Jer prvi koji je Pavao stvarno susreo kada je došao u Makedoniju bio je Luka. A budući da smo u knjizi Djela apostolska, vidjet ćete da kada dođemo do tog dijela knjige Djela apostolskih, Luka počinje pisati više u prvoj osobi nego u trećoj osobi. Tako je, očito, u ovom trenutku u Djelima apostolskim Luka postao Pavlov suputnik i počeo putovati s njim. Počeo je koristiti zamjenice "mi" i "nas" umjesto "oni" i "oni". Ovo je, bez sumnje, mjesto gdje je Luke postao sudionik i očevidac onih stvari koje su se od ovog trenutka događale. Mi ćemo vam to iznijeti kada dođemo do te točke.<br/>On započinje Djela apostolska povezujući ga s Evanđeljem prema Luki. Zanimljivo je da je posljednja stvar koju Luka bilježi u svom evanđelju prva stvar koju bilježi u Djelima apostolskim. Pronalazimo evanđelje Luke zatvaranje kao što je Isus govori svojim učenicima da čekaju u Jeruzalemu dok su obdarena snagom odozgo. A onda je Isus uzašao na nebo, i tako on zatvara evanđelje. U otvaranju Djela apostolska, on piše,<br/>Napisao sam ti, Teofile, prijašnju raspravu o svemu što je Isus počeo činiti i učiti (Djela 1:1).<br/>Ključna riječ je započela. Evanđelje prema Luki nije puna priča o službi Isusa Krista. To je samo početak službe Isusa Krista. Isus nastavlja služiti potrebama ljudi. Isus nastavlja liječiti bolesne. Isus nastavlja uskrsnuti mrtve. Isus nastavlja služiti svojoj ljubavi i evanđelju svijetu, tek sada služi preko onih učenika koji su pomazani Njegovim Duhom Svetim. Ali Kristova služba se nastavlja; u osnovi, to je pretpostavka da Luka uzima u Djelima apostolskim. Bivši traktat o svemu što je Isus započeo, i da radi i da uči.<br/>Zbog toga su Djela apostolska nedovršena knjiga: u tome Gospodin i danas nastavlja djelovati kroz živote onih koji su se posvetili tome da budu Božja oruđa. Biti vođeni i vođeni i pomazani Njegovim Duhom Svetim, nastaviti službu Isusa u svijetu danas. Sada je Bog odredio da se Njegovo djelo treba izvršiti putem ljudskih instrumenata. Ne kažem da to mora biti izvršeno. Bog može koristiti anđeoska bića za svoje djelo, i doći će vrijeme, tijekom knjige Otkrivenja, kada će Bog koristiti anđele da naviještaju njegovo evanđelje ljudima diljem svijeta. Otkrivenje, poglavlje 14, "Prvi anđeo koji leti kroz sredinu neba ima vječno evanđelje" (Otkrivenje 14:6 ). Ali u ovom trenutku, Bog je odlučio koristiti ljudske instrumente. Kao nesavršeni kao što mogu biti, ipak je to ono što je Bog naredio da se koristi. Uzbudljiva stvar o tome je, Bog će me koristiti i Bog će vas koristiti. Toliko puta, mi smo moleći se, "Gospodine, ne mogu govoriti. Nikad nisam bio u mogućnosti govoriti prije ili čak i sada, Gospodine." Kao što je Mojsije pokušao moliti od Božjeg poziva. Jeremija je rekao: "Gospodine, ja sam samo dijete; nitko me neće slušati." I svi imamo svoje izgovore zašto ne možemo biti iskorišteni. Zar ne? Svi znamo razloge zašto Bog nije mogao koristiti nas.<br/>Jednom, dok je Gospodin pozivao proroka da izvrši svoje djelo, rekao je: "Gospodine, pošalji koga hoćeš." Gospodin je rekao: "Hej, pozvao sam te." "Gospodine, dobra ideja; pošalji koga hoćeš." Često smo u toj poziciji, "Gospodine, pošalji po rukama koga god hoćeš, bilo koga osim mene, Gospodine." A ipak, Bog je odredio da nas koristi.<br/>Sada, svatko od nas može pokazati svoje vlastite nesavršenosti. Svatko od nas može ukazati na vlastite nesposobnosti, i svi mi možemo pronaći izgovor zašto Bog ne bi htio da me koristi. Ali ipak, Bog je izabrao da vas koristi. Da se kroz tvoj život može otkriti svijetu u potrebi. Pitaš se kada Bog ima takve instrumente za korištenje kako je ikada učinio posao, zar ne?<br/>Sve do dana kad je bio uznesen, nakon što je po Duhu Svetom dao zapovijedi apostolima koje je izabrao (Djela 1:2):<br/>To je ono čime je završio Evanđelje po Luki. Na dan kada je Isus bio uznesen, nakon što je rekao apostolima da čekaju obdarenje moći.<br/>I njima se, nakon muke svoje, po mnogim nepogrešivim dokazima pokazao živim (Dj 1,3).<br/>Teško je poricati činjenicu uskrsnuća Isusa Krista. Bio sam zabavljen, kao i uznemiren i iritiran, člankom koji sam pročitao u Santa Ana Registru prošle subote. O znanosti o stvaranju i evolucijskim teorijama koje su predstavljene u okružnim školama. Kako to, ovaj profesor je rekao da predaje nastavu o znanosti, i da se tako bave samo činjenicama, i da nemaju mjesta za teorije. Budući da se znanost temelji na činjenicama, a stvaranje se temelji na vjerskim praznovjerjima. Potrebno je puno vjere da biste vjerovali vjerskim teorijama. Kada se bavite činjenicama, možete ih jednostavno prihvatiti. Pomislio sam, "Vrlo zanimljivo u toj klasi znanosti, naučili su me da je to činjenica da je svijet star četiri milijarde godina. Danas uče da je to činjenica da je svijet star dvanaest milijardi godina. Ne tako davno sam išao u školu."<br/>Zanimljivo je da Bibliju nikada nije trebalo revidirati ili ažurirati kako bi zadovoljila trenutne podatke koje su ljudi otkrili. A ipak, ako biste danas uzeli moje srednjoškolske prirodoslovne udžbenike i pokušali od njih podučavati prirodoslovne predmete, otkrili biste da mnoge stvari koje su podučavane kao znanstvene činjenice kada sam bio u srednjoj školi više nisu prepoznate kao znanstvene činjenice. Jednostavna stanična protoplazma više nije jednostavna stanica, već iznimno složena. Ako postoji činjenica koja se može posvjedočiti u povijesti, to je činjenica uskrsnuća Isusa Krista od mrtvih.<br/>Imamo sustav sudske prakse koji se temelji na svjedočenju svjedoka. Ako je čovjek optužen za zločin i postoje ljudi koji su svjedočili tom zločinu dok je bio počinjen, i oni su dovedeni do standarda, i zaklinju se da će govoriti istinu, cijelu istinu i ništa osim istine, tako im Bog pomogao. I u svom ispitivanju oni tvrde da: "Vidio sam tog čovjeka u banci dvadeset trećeg svibnja. Vidio sam ga kako izvlači pištolj iz svog kaputa. Čuo sam ga kako zahtijeva da mu se sav novac preda. Vidio sam ga dok je izlazio iz banke. Vidio sam ga kako ga je časnik uhitio vani." I ako možete dobiti tri ili četiri svjedoka da ukažu na tog čovjeka i držati svoje svjedočanstvo pod unakrsnim ispitivanjem, taj se čovjek proglašava krivim. On je taj koji je to učinio. Imamo dva ili tri svjedoka koji svjedoče istu priču o tom čovjeku, i prihvaćeno je kao činjenica da je on počinio zločin i da je kriv. Imate svjedoke koji su se zakleli da će reći istinu koji provjeravaju.<br/>Nakon Isusove smrti, kad je uskrsnuo, ukazao se mnogim drugim ljudima koji su svjedočili pod zakletvom da su ga vidjeli. Da su razgovarali s njim, da im se ukazao na različitim mjestima pod različitim okolnostima. I za razdoblje od četrdeset dana je bio u posjetu s njima. I u jednom trenutku, do pet stotina ljudi koji su se okupili na jednom mjestu, On se pojavio. Teško je samo odbaciti ili poricati svjedočanstvo tih ljudi. To znači diskreditirati cijeli naš sustav sudske prakse. Ali ne samo to, ovi ljudi koji su svjedočili da su vidjeli uskrsloga Gospodina, da su razgovarali s njim, da su jeli s njim, svi su, osim jednoga, susreli nasilnu smrt od ruku drugih ljudi jer su tvrdili da je priča koju su ispričali istinita. Govorite o svjedocima koji su se zakleli da će reći istinu, cijelu istinu, ništa osim istine. Ako je nečiji život bio ugrožen zbog tog svjedoka, a to je bila laž, barem bi jedan od njih bio slomljen pod pritiskom. Priznali bi cijelu prevaru. "Pokazao se živ nakon svoje muke kroz mnoge nepogrešive dokaze."<br/>Četrdeset dana viđao ih je i govorio im o kraljevstvu Božjem (Dj 1, 3).<br/>Ponekad krivimo učenike zbog njihovih pitanja o vremenu Božjeg kraljevstva. Neka se podsjetimo da je kraljevstvo Božje bio omiljeni subjekt Isusa Krista. On je uvijek govorio o kraljevstvu Božjem, i velika je nada da je On usadio u srca svih ljudi. Stvari neće uvijek ostati pokvarene kao što jesu. Svijet neće zauvijek proći pod vlašću tame, pod ropstvom zla. Bog će jednog dana uspostaviti svoje kraljevstvo na zemlji. Kraljevstvo pravedne radosti i mira. "Isus će vladati, gdje sunce trči svoja uzastopna putovanja, a njegovo kraljevstvo će se protezati od obale do obale." I taj dan će biti najslavniji dan koji je svijet ikada vidio, kao što će bolest i patnja i bol biti ukinuti u Njegovom kraljevstvu. Kao što će grijeh i pohlepa i te stvari koje su učinile svijet tako nepodnošljivim mjestom biti ukinute u Njegovom kraljevstvu. Bezbožni komercijalizam, iskorištavanje čovjeka, sve te stvari su ukinute u Njegovom slavnom kraljevstvu kada On vlada. Nije ni čudo da su učenici bili željni da ga dobiju. Ja sam željan da ga dobijem; Ja sam željan da Njegovo kraljevstvo dođe. I Isus nam je rekao kada se molimo, prva molba je: "Dođi kraljevstvo tvoje. Budi volja tvoja na zemlji, kao što je na nebu" (Matej 6:10). To je ispravna vrsta želje koju svi trebamo imati. Želim kraljevstvo Božje. I tako im je tijekom tog četrdesetodnevnog razdoblja govorio o kraljevstvu.<br/>I okupivši se s njima, zapovjedi im da ne odlaze iz Jeruzalema, nego da čekaju obećanje Očevo, koje ste čuli od mene (Dj 1, 4).<br/>On je rekao: "Evo, ostanite ovdje u Jeruzalemu dok ne primite obećanje Oca." Ovo obećanje na koje se on odnosi je, bez sumnje, obećanje u Joelu gdje je Gospodin obećao: "I dogodit će se u kasnijim danima, govori Gospodin, da ću izliti Duha svoga na svako tijelo; i vaši sinovi i kćeri prorokovat će, i vaši mladići će sanjati snove, vaši starci će vidjeti vizije; i na moje sluge i moje sluškinje izlit ću Gospodina." Očevo obećanje: doći će dan kada će Bog izliti svoga Duha na svako tijelo, na sve vjernike. Svatko će primiti tu dinamiku od Boga.<br/>Doista, Ivan je kršten vodom, ali vi ćete biti kršteni Duhom Svetim za nekoliko dana (Dj 1, 5).<br/>Ivan je krstio vodom, potopio ljude u vodu, "uskoro ćete biti uronjeni u Duha Svetoga."<br/>Kad su se okupili, pitali su ga: "Gospodine, hoćeš li u ovo vrijeme obnoviti kraljevstvo Izraelu?"<br/>"Kad će to biti, Gospodine? Kada je vrijeme za ovu obnovu?" I Isus im sada govori, ne o kraljevstvu, već o moći koju će primiti za službu. I tako On odbacuje njihovo pitanje.<br/>Rekoše im: "Nije na vama da znate vremena ili razdoblja koja je Otac postavio u svoju vlastitu vlast" (Dj 1, 7).<br/>"To nije za vas da znate." Oni su stalno živjeli u iščekivanju neposrednog uspostavljanja kraljevstva. Tijekom cijelog Isusovog života, oni su očekivali da će u bilo kojem trenutku ući u telefonsku govornicu i izaći kao Spasitelj svijeta. Shazzam! Pokazao je svoju moć i svrgnuo svjetske vladavine, uspostavio Božje kraljevstvo na zemlji. I oni su svakodnevno čekali da se ta promjena dogodi. I kad god bi Isus govorio o odlasku u Jeruzalem, predan u ruke grešnom čovjeku, a zatim razapet, "Oh, oh ne, Gospodine. Ne, ne razumiješ kraljevstvo, Gospodine. Budi tako daleko od tebe." Kad je Isus umro na križu, svi su bili razočarani.<br/>Dva učenika na putu za Emaus, tako tužna. "Hej, dečki. Kako to da ste tako tužni kao što hodate?" "Kako to mislite? Mora da ste stranac ovdje ako ne znate što se događa u posljednje vrijeme u Jeruzalemu." "Koje stvari?" "O, čovjek po imenu Isus iz Nazareta...o, čovjek, bio je moćan i moćan. Pomazanje Božje bilo je na njegovom životu. Nadali smo se da je u njemu bilo izbavljenje Izraela, ali su ga razapeli. Nadali smo se . . . sada je mrtav. " Sada je uskrsnuo i kaže: "Za nekoliko dana, ljudi, primit ćete obećanje Oca." "O, kakvo obećanje? Obećanje uspostave kraljevstva?" Vidite, bilo je legitimno da pitaju. "Je li to Gospodin? U redu! Je li vrijeme? Hoćete li sada uspostaviti svoje kraljevstvo?" "Ne. Nije za vas da znate vremena koja je Otac odredio ili koja Otac ima u svojoj vlasti. Ali primit ćete snagu kad Duh Sveti siđe na vas."<br/>Ovdje se grčki prijedlog epi koristi za označavanje novog odnosa koji su trebali imati sa Duhom Svetim. U Evanđelju po Ivanu, poglavlje 14, dok je Isus obećavao da će poslati Duha Svetoga, rekao je: "Neću vas ostaviti bez utjehe. Ja ću doći k vama i zamolit ću Oca, i on će vam poslati drugoga tješitelja, Duha istine, kojeg svijet ne može primiti jer ga ne vidi niti ga poznaje, nego ga poznajete jer prebiva s vama i bit će u vama" (Iv 14,17-18). Isti grčki prijedlog kao i naš, samo ga pišu "en" umjesto "u". Dvostruki odnos postoji u Ivanu: On je s vama, ali On će prebivati u vama. Ali sada je Isus rekao da ćete primiti snagu kada Duh Sveti dođe na vas. Grčki prijedlog epi, koji se u različitim tekstovima u Novom zavjetu prevodi kao "na" ili "preko", ili mi se sviđa, "prelijeva".<br/>U sedmom poglavlju Ivanovog evanđelja: "Posljednjeg dana, velikog blagdana, kada je Isus stajao ondje na Hramskoj gori i vikao narodu: 'Ako tko bude žedan, neka dođe k meni i neka pije. Ivan je rekao: "Ovo je govorio o Duhu, koji još nije dao da oni koji vjeruju u njega treba primiti" (Iv 7:37-39 ). Što je govorio o Duhu? Da će biti kao potok žive vode koja teče. Volim: "Kad vas Duh izlijeva", na vas, ili nad vama, ili izlijeva od vas. Dakle, trostruki odnos: On je s vama prije vašeg obraćenja, On je onaj koji vas tjera da shvatite da ste grešnik, On je onaj koji ukazuje na Isusa Krista kao odgovor dok uvjerava svijet u grijeh, pravednost i sud. U trenutku kada otvorite svoj život i srce Isusu Kristu i pozovete ga da uđe, Duh Sveti dolazi i počinje prebivati u vama. On će biti u vama. "Ne znate li da niste svoji, skupo ste kupljeni, dakle proslavite Boga u tijelu svojemu i u duhu svojemu, a ne znate li da je tijelo vaše hram Duha Svetoga koji je u vama? Ne opijajte se vinom, u kojem je viška, nego se napunite, ili se napunite Duhom" (1 Kor 6,19-20; Efežanima 5,18). Ali evo trećeg odnosa. To je iskustvo osnaživanja.<br/>Vi ćete primiti dinamiku kad Duh Sveti siđe na vas, i bit ćete mi svjedoci (Dj 1,8).<br/>I tako dinamika, biti svjedok za Isusa Krista. Zanimljivo je da je riječ svjedočanstvo na grčkom je riječ martus odakle smo dobili našu riječ mučenik. A na grčkom to znači mučenik. Svjedok je onaj koji ne samo da proglašava ono u što vjeruje, on živi ono u što vjeruje, on je ono u što vjeruje, i on to tako snažno vjeruje, da će, ako je potrebno, umrijeti za ono u što vjeruje. To je koliko je njegova vjera jaka. On je Martus. Ne boji se umrijeti za ono u što vjeruje.<br/>Sjećate se kad se Pavao vraćao u Jeruzalem, a Agab je sišao iz Cezareje, uzeo Pavlov pojas, zavezao se i rekao: "Tako je čovjek koji posjeduje ovaj pojas da bude svezan kad dođe u Jeruzalem." I Pavlovi prijatelji su počeli plakati, govoreći: "Pavle, ne idi, ne idi." A on je rekao: "Što misliš pod ovim suzama? Misliš li da ćeš me odvratiti? Misliš li da se brinem da ću biti vezan? Spreman sam umrijeti." On je bio kukavica. "Spreman sam umrijeti." Smrt zbog vjere te nije učinila mučenikom; jer si bio mučenik, bio si pogubljen. Jer si bio svjedok, jer si tako čvrsto vjerovao. Dakle, to te nije učinilo svjedokom, samo je dokazalo tko si. Bio si svjedok cijelo vrijeme. Da nisi bio Martus, nikada ne bi otišao u smrt. Odustao bi; rekao bi, "Whoa, whoa, čekaj, čekaj. Čekajte, promijenimo kurs ovdje. Mislim da sam možda pogriješio." Onda kažete, "Pa, on nije bio Martus. Krađa konja ne čini vas konjokradicom; to samo dokazuje da ste bili. Nitko ne krade konja osim ako je konjokradica. Dakle, krađa ne čini vas konjokradicom, to samo dokazuje da ste cijelo vrijeme bili. Biti mučenik samo dokazuje što ste bili svjedok, Martus. "I vi ćete biti svjedoci." I nije li zanimljivo da je većina njih bila mučenik? "Svjedoci meni."<br/>Svjedočanstvo je trebalo biti i u Jeruzalemu i u cijeloj Judeji (Dj 1, 8).<br/>Svjedočanstvo je počelo kod kuće. Najteže mjesto, zar ne? Počelo je kod kuće u Jeruzalemu, a zatim područje oko Jeruzalema, područje Judeje. A onda se proširilo u Samariji. A onda je trebalo otići u krajnje dijelove svijeta. I dok proučavamo knjigu Djela apostolska, vidjet ćemo upravo taj napredak. Kako je svjedočanstvo započelo u Jeruzalemu. To ćemo saznati u sljedećem poglavlju. A onda ćemo vidjeti kako se počeo širiti po Judeji. I onda je Filip otišao u Samariju, i onda su konačno Pavao i Barnaba pozvani da idu u krajeve svijeta. I tako se svjedočanstvo širilo pomazanjem i osnaživanjem Duha Svetoga.<br/>Kad je to govorio, dok su oni gledali, bio je podignut, a oblak ga je primio od njihovih očiju (Dj 1, 9).<br/>Ovo je posljednje obećanje koje je Isus dao svojim učenicima. To su posljednje riječi prije Njegovog uzašašća. Naravno, kasnije je došao i razgovarao s Pavlom i drugima, ali prije Njegovog uzašašća, to je Njegova posljednja riječ. Kad je to rekao dok su ga promatrali, podignu ga i oblak im ga odnese od očiju.<br/>Dok su gledali prema nebu dok je uzalazio, gle, dva čovjeka stajahu s njima u bijelom odijelu.<br/>Pretpostavljamo da su to bili anđeli.<br/>Koji je također rekao: "Galilejanci, što stojite i gledate u nebo? Ovaj Isus, koji je od vas uznesen na nebo, tako će doći kao što ste ga vidjeli da ide na nebo" (Dj 1, 11).<br/>Vidjeli su ga kako se uzdiže na nebo i vidjet će ga kad se vrati. "Gle, Gospodin dolazi s deset tisuća svojih svetaca da izvrši sud na zemlji" (Jud 1,14-15). "Onomu koji nas je ljubio i sebe dao za nas i koji nas je Bogu našemu načinio kraljevima i svećenicima koji će s njim kraljevati na zemlji, gle, Gospodin dolazi i vidjet će ga svako oko, i oplakivat će i oni koji su ga proboli" (Otk 1, 5-7). Dakle, Gospodin dolazi. Svako oko će Ga vidjeti. Jehovini svjedoci kažu da je već došao, ali to je bio tajni dolazak. Budući da su ga samo učenici vidjeli kako odlazi, samo su ga učenici, Jehovini svjedoci, vidjeli kako se vraća. A Isus reče: "Ako vam kažu: 'U tajnosti je došao i ušao u tajnu sobu, ne vjerujte!'" (Mt 24,26). Dakle, morate izabrati: vjerovati li Isusu ili njima.<br/>"Ovaj Isus, koji je od vas uznesen na nebo, doći će onako kako ste ga vidjeli da odlazi na nebo."<br/>Sada postoji vrlo zanimljiv stih u II Ivan, stih Djela 1:7 , "Jer mnogi varalice su ušli u svijet koji ne priznaju da je Isus Krist došao u tijelu." To je, nažalost, loš prijevod s grčkog. Jer ovaj sudionik je u sadašnjem vremenu i treba prevesti "dolazi u tijelu." Oni koji bi poricati da Isus Krist dolazi u tijelu. Što Ivan kaže o njima? "Oni su varalica i antikrist. Pazite da ne izgubimo ono što smo radili, nego da primimo punu nagradu. Jer tko god prijestupi i ne ostane u nauku Kristovu, nema Boga. Tko ostaje u nauku Kristovu, ima i Oca i Sina. I ako tko dođe na vaša vrata (u subotu ujutro) i ne donese ovu nauku, ne primajte ga u kuću i ne opraštajte se s njim. Jer onaj koji ga oprašta, sudionik je njegovih zlih djela" (2Ivan 1:7-11). Pitajte ih jedno pitanje: "Dolazi li Isus u tijelu?" Samo ih pitajte to pitanje. A ako kažu ne, samo se sjetite što vas je Ivan upozorio i što vam je Ivan rekao. "Ako tko ne priznaje da Isus Krist dolazi u tijelu." Sjećaš li se kad je bio s učenicima i rekao: "Daj mi da jedem?" On je rekao: "Znaš, duhovi ne jedu; dotakni me. Vidiš? Ja sam." Dakle, taj isti Isus ponovno dolazi na isti način na koji su ga vidjeli da ide na nebo. A ja, za jednu, vjerujem da je taj dolazak vrlo brzo.<br/>Zatim se vratiše u Jeruzalem s gore zvane Maslinska, koja je od Jeruzalema udaljena oko dvije trećine milje. A kad uđoše, uziđoše u gornju sobu gdje bijahu i Petar, i Jakov, i Ivan, i Andrija, i Filip, i Toma, i Bartolomej, i Matej, i Jakov, sin Alfejev, i Šimun, i Juda, brat Jakovljev. I svi su oni jednodušno ostajali u molitvi i prošnji, sa ženama, s Marijom, majkom Isusovom, i s braćom njegovom (Dj 1,12-14).<br/>Ovo je posljednje spominjanje Marije, Isusove majke. U ovom trenutku i od ovog trenutka dalje, nema daljnjeg spominjanja nje u Djelima apostolskim ili u poslanicama. Nema spominjanja njezine smrti ili njezina čudesnog uzašašća na nebo, bez smrti. Ništa se ne spominje u Pismu. To je tišina.<br/>Njegova braća bi vjerojatno bila referenca na Jakova i Judu i onu drugu braću koja su bila sinovi Josipa i Marije.<br/>Gornja soba - postoje neki koji kažu da je to ista gornja soba u kojoj je Isus imao Posljednju večeru sa svojim učenicima. Pa ipak, postoje i drugi koji drže da je ova gornja soba soba u hramskim prostorijama gdje se rana crkva sastala. Izaberite.<br/>U one dane Petar ustade usred učenika i reče (broj njihovih imena zajedno je bio oko stotinu i dvadeset), braćo, mora da se ispuni ovo Pismo, koje je Duh Sveti preko usta Davidovih govorio o Judi, koji je bio vodič onima koji su uzeli Isusa (Dj 1,15-16).<br/>Opet ovdje, Petar je još uvijek isti nagli ja. Oni čekaju u molitvi i molbi, a Petar ustaje i kaže, "Fellows, postoji Pismo koje se mora ispuniti." I znate da će krenuti naprijed, "Hajdemo pokrenuti program; bacimo ždrijeb i saznajmo tko će zauzeti Judino mjesto." Osjećam da je Petar ponovno bio u tijelu, manifestirajući tu nasilnu prirodu koja je bila njegova. I mislim da buduća povijest Crkve u knjizi Djela apostolskih to pokazuje. Zanima me Petrovo razumijevanje Pisma, kako on citira s toliko mjesta u Starom zavjetu. Petar pokazuje vrlo veliko razumijevanje starozavjetnih spisa, što je točka u njegovu korist.<br/>Zapazite da Petar pripisuje Duhu Svetom ono što je David napisao. Tako, "Sve Pismo je dano nadahnućem Božjim" (2 Ti 3:16) . Nije dio Pisma. Jer, ako mi kažete da je dio Svetog pisma dao nadahnuće od Boga, onda vas moram pitati: "Koji su dijelovi nadahnuće, a koji nisu nadahnuće?" A onda si ti autoritet koji mi govori u koji dio mogu vjerovati, a u koji ne mogu vjerovati, i onog trenutka kad Bog više nije autoritet, već ti si autoritet, ja sam u nevolji. Čuvajte se onih koji govore: "Pa vi ne vjerujete u sve Pisma!" I sami Pisma govore: "Sve Pisma su od Boga nadahnute." A ovdje, Luka piše o onome što je Petar govorio, izjavljuje da je David zapravo bio glasnik Duha Svetoga. Duh Sveti, po ustima Davidovim, govorio je o Judi.<br/>Doista, on bijaše ubrojen među nas, jedan od dvanaestorice, koji bijaše stekao dio ove službe. Ali sada ovaj čovjek kupi polje uz plaću za bezakonje i pade naglavačke (Dj 1,17-18).<br/>On je kupio polje, lončarovo polje kao što Zaharija izjavljuje u jedanaestom poglavlju.<br/>Pade naglavačke i rasprsnu se u sredini, i sva mu utroba iznikne (Dj 1,18).<br/>Postoje oni koji nalaze neslaganje u pismima, jer u jednom od evanđelja nam je rečeno da kada se Juda vratio i pokušao vratiti novac, oni su rekli, "Hej, to je vaš problem. Ne možemo ga uzeti." I stavili ga natrag u riznicu hrama. "To je krvavi novac." Zatim ga je bacio tamo na pod hrama i otišao se objesiti. Ovdje nam Petar kaže da je pao naglavačke i samo se pojavio. A postoje i oni koji zamišljaju neslaganje. Vrlo jednostavno, popeo se na drvo da se objesi, zavezao konopac oko vrata i zavezao ga za ud i skočio. I sila pada ili je slomila konopac ili glavu, i pao je dolje u kanjon i baš kao što je rekao ovdje.<br/>Svi su stanovnici Jeruzalema znali da se to polje na njihovom jeziku zove Akeldama, što znači: Polje krvi. Jer je napisano u knjizi Psalama: "Neka opuste prebivalište njegovo i neka nitko ne prebiva u njemu; i neka njegova biskupija uzme drugi" (Dj 1,19-20).<br/>Sada u stvarnosti on citira iz dva različita psalma ovdje. Iz Psalma 69:25 , on ga stavlja zajedno s Psalm 109:8 . I stavljajući ih zajedno pronalazi ove proročanstva o Judi.<br/>Zato od tih ljudi (Dj 1, 21)<br/>Sada ovdje traže nekoga da zauzme Judino mjesto da bude apostol. Ovdje su kvalifikacije koje su tražili u to vrijeme.<br/>Zbog toga od ovih ljudi koji su bili s nama sve vrijeme dok je Gospodin Isus ulazio i izlazio među nas (Dj 1, 21)<br/>Sada se sjećate da je bilo mnogo učenika, od kojih je mnogo učenika Isus izabrao deset da budu apostoli. A riječ apostol znači "jedan koji je poslan." Ili je izabrao dvanaest da budu apostoli, pa je poslao dvanaest. Broj ljudske vlade. "Imamo samo jedanaest. Trebamo jednoga da zauzme Judino mjesto, ali trebamo jednoga koji je bio s nama sve vrijeme od početka s Isusom."<br/>Od dana Ivanova krštenja pa sve do dana kad je od nas uznesen, netko mora biti zaređen da bude svjedok njegova uskrsnuća (Dj 1,22).<br/>Dakle, to su bili zahtjevi koje su tražili. Netko tko je bio oko cijelog vremena. Od vremena Ivanovog krštenja do uzašašća. I onaj koji je vidio uskrslog Gospodina, i tako mogao nositi činjenicu uskrsnuća, njihovo svjedočanstvo o činjenici.<br/>Apostol Pavao, kasnije tvrdeći da je apostol, rekao je: "Zar nisam vidio uskrslog Krista?" Očito je to bio jedan od zahtjeva apostolstva. Netko me upitao: "Ima li danas apostola?" Pa, ne znam. Ne mislim da postoje u istom smislu kao što su bili u Novom zavjetu. Sigurno ne postoji nitko danas koji može svjedočiti uskrsnuće kao što su to učinili.<br/>Imenovaše dvojicu: Josipa, koji se zvao Barsaba, a zvao se Just, i Mateja. I oni su molili, govoreći: "Ti, Gospodine, koji poznaješ srca svih ljudi, pokaži jesi li od ove dvojice koje si izabrao,<br/>Mislim da često činimo ovu pogrešku dajući Gospodinu dva izbora, oba pogrešna. Ograničavanje Boga, vidite. Mi smo tako skloni tome. Očito, Pavao je bio Božji izbor. Peter je bio napet, i skočio je i rekao, "Hej, moramo učiniti nešto, znaš, moramo pomoći Bogu. Znaš, jedan je nestao i moramo ga napuniti." A opet, "Bože, koji od ove dvojice želiš?" I dao Bogu dva izbora.<br/>da bi mogao sudjelovati u ovoj službi i ovom apostolstvu, iz kojega je Juda pao prijestupom, da bi mogao otići na svoje mjesto. I tako su dali svoje ždrijebove (Djela 1:25-26);<br/>Zanimljiv način na koji su nastojali odrediti Božju volju. Bacimo kockice, saznajmo što je Božja volja ovdje. Zanimljivo mi je, razni načini na koje su ljudi osmislili da razaznaju Božju volju. Sada, u starozavjetnim vremenima imali su zanimljiv način dolaska svećeniku, koji bi pitao Gospodina za njih preko urima i tumima, "svjetla i savršenstva." Samo što su ti urima i tumima bili, ne znamo. Siguran sam da to nisu bile naočale u boji koje je Joseph Smith pronašao sa Zlatnim pločama; čarobne naočale, da kada ih stavite, odjednom možete pročitati hijeroglifski natpis.<br/>Postoje oni koji kažu da su urim i tummim zapravo crno-bijeli kamen koji se nosio u vrećici na prsima svećenika. Oni bi se molili i pitali Gospodina posebno pitanje. Sjećaš li se da je David pitao Jahvu: "Gospodine, hoćemo li izaći na Filistejce?" Odgovor je bio: "Ne!" Sutradan opet: "Gospodine, hoćemo li izaći na Filistejce?" Odgovor je bio: "Da." "Kad ćemo izaći?" Postavljali bi konkretna pitanja, a Gospodin bi ih vodio kroz Urim i Thummin. Kažu da bi se svećenik molio, tražio Boga, a zatim posegnuo i izvukao jedan od dva kamena. Ako je to bio bijeli kamen, to je bio odgovor da. Ako je to bilo ne, onda bi to bio crni kamen koji bi izvukao. Neki čak kažu da smo dobili izraz crna kugla iz ovog Urim i Thummim. Zapravo, natrag u izvorniku to je ne glas protiv određenog projekta ili ideje. Ne znamo što su Urim i Thummim bili, ali tijekom Starog zavjeta, koristili su metodu bacanja ždrijeba kako bi odredili Božju volju.<br/>Dakle, ovdje učenici podižu istu stvar kao što bacaju kocke kako bi vidjeli koji je od dvojice koje je Bog izabrao zamijeniti Judu Iškariotskog.<br/>Ždrijeb je pao na Mateja; on je bio izbrojan s jedanaest (Djela 1:26).<br/>Sada tko je u svijetu Matthias? Nitko nikada nije čuo za njega prije ili poslije. Bit će zanimljivo upoznati Matthias i saznati tko je on i što je učinio. Mislim da je iz kasnije povijesti, očito je pretpostaviti da je Bog izabrao Pavla kao apostola. Pavao to izjavljuje sam. Sada je to posljednji put da smo ikada pročitali o njima nastoje razlikovati Božju volju bacanjem ždrijebom ili slučajno vrsta stvari.<br/>Znam jednog čovjeka koji će danas, nastojeći razaznati Gospodinovu volju, moliti i postaviti Gospodinu jedno pitanje. Imat će deset penija u džepu, i dok se moli, uzet će ih sa zatvorenim očima i staviti ih na stol, a ako sve dođu glave, to je da. Zanimljiva stvar, s vremena na vrijeme, svi će se pojaviti, a to je prilično dobra vjerojatnost. Ipak, ne nalazimo nikakav uzorak za to nakon što je Duh Sveti dao. Nakon što je Duh Sveti došao na crkvu, onda je Duh Sveti počeo govoriti s njima i usmjeriti ih. I Duh Sveti je rekao, "Odvojite mi Pavla i Barnabu za službu gdje sam ih pozvao" ( Djela 13:2 ). I Duh Sveti ih je poslao. Tako smo pronašli crkvu više izravno vođeni Duhom Svetim. Nakon što je Duh Sveti došao, ovaj bacanje kocke kako bi saznali Božju volju je stavljen na stranu.<br/>"<br/><br/>Verzija kralja Jakova<br/><br/>Ovo je verzija Biblije kralja Jakova iz 1769. godine (također poznata kao Ovlaštena verzija). |

Yes that is correct, the Urbanears don't have a built in noise cancelling mic on the headphone itself but from what I can see there is a mic on the cable provided.<br/>1.

In fact, dynamic drivers work exactly the same as dynamic microphones but in reverse. Inside a dynamic driver there is a magnet, and when you plug in the headphones, you are sending a AC current through it which will turn the voice coil into a magnet. Depending on the direction of the current, the polarity of the magnet will change. Now since we know for a magnet, same charges repels and different charges attract, we know that the voice coil will move back and forth depending on it's polarity at the time. The voice coil is attached to the diaphragm which will then move back and forth creating a sound wave. The same occurs in reverse, if you move a coil through a magnet you produce a current instead. Since your voice is pushing the diaphragm, it is moving the voice coil back and forth generating the current you have observed.<br/><br/>100+ Head-Fier<br/><br/>Joined:<br/>Nov 7, 2011<br/><br/>Posts:<br/>134<br/><br/>Likes: 55<br/><br/>Exactly.

Budući da znamo za magnet, isti naboji odbijaju i različiti naboji privlače, znamo da će se glasovna zavojnica pomicati naprijed-nazad ovisno o polarnosti u tom trenutku. Glasovna zavojnica je pričvršćena na dijafragmu koja će se zatim pomicati naprijed-nazad stvarajući zvučni val. Isto se događa u obrnutom smjeru, ako pomičete zavojnicu kroz magnet umjesto toga proizvodite struju.

Stalin's opposition within the party, including Bukharin, Yagoda and Rykov were purged in these show trials, as Stalin manipulatively forced them to confess to crimes of planning a coup and opposing the state, even if there was no proof. Gabor T Rittersporn said, "Many of the victims were sincerely devoted to the principles of Bolshevism." This amplifies proof that the Bolshevik ideals that had once been the roots of the Communist Party were being disarranged and destroyed by the Purges. The party was depleted and former members helplessly watched Stalin use the great purge as a tool to transform Russia from a one party state to an unchallenged dictatorship. Again, the purges were shattering the framework of the Communist Party, formed during the Bolshevik revolution. This agrees with the "Stalin the executioner" source as both show the manipulative character, that helped the dictator to enhance his grip on Russia's throat.<br/>The manipulative manner, with which Stalin incriminated his targeted opposition during the purges, in the eyes of everyday Russians, also had an implosive impact on Soviet Society. Stalin was able to collect support from the people through his use of propaganda and the media to help him develop a "cult of personality" and the image of a heroic and brave leader. Through this support Stalin implanted mistrust into the minds of the people, convincing them that traitors of the revolution and what he described as 'enemies of the people', were amongst them.

Staljinova opozicija unutar stranke, uključujući Buharina, Jagodu i Rykova, bila je očišćena na ovim suđenjima, jer ih je Staljin manipulativno prisilio da priznaju zločine planiranja državnog udara i suprotstavljanja državi, čak i ako nije bilo dokaza. Gabor T. Rittersporn je rekao: "Mnoge od žrtava su bile iskreno posvećene načelima boljševizma." To pojačava dokaz da su boljševički ideali koji su nekada bili korijeni Komunističke partije bili dezorganizirani i uništeni čistkama. Stranka je bila iscrpljena, a bivši članovi bespomoćno su gledali Staljina kako koristi veliku čistku kao alat za transformaciju Rusije iz jednopartijske države u neosporenu diktaturu. Opet, čistke su razbijale okvir Komunističke partije, formirane tijekom boljševičke revolucije. To se slaže s izvorom "Staljina dželata" jer oba pokazuju manipulativni karakter, koji je pomogao diktatoru da ojača svoj zagrljaj na ruskom grlu.<br/>Manipulativni način na koji je Staljin inkriminirao svoje ciljano protivljenje tijekom čistki, u očima svakodnevnih Rusa, također je imao implozivni utjecaj na sovjetsko društvo. Staljin je bio u stanju prikupiti potporu od ljudi kroz njegovu upotrebu propagande i medija kako bi mu pomogli razviti "kult osobnosti" i sliku herojskog i hrabrog vođe. Kroz ovu podršku Staljin je usadio nepovjerenje u umove ljudi, uvjeravajući ih da su izdajnici revolucije i ono što je opisao kao "neprijatelji naroda" bili među njima.

| Supercell is nerfing brawlers instead of nerfing star powers. I was at 750 last season with power 8 nita and it is very tough to go past that, like, star powers play a really dominant role. The matchmaking is also trash. When i play gem grab(around 600 trophies), there are often matchups where the enemy team has one more player than us who is maxed and it's not even that we have a lvl 9 to compete versus that. Sometimes there are even matchups where the enemy team is fully maxed and none of us are. this is why i dont play brawl stars seriously anymore. It's not even like there arent many players who are not maxed and around 600 trophies. It's annoying.<br/>Edit: I think supercell should have at least a basic mechanism that takes the average of levels of brawlers when setting up matches.<br/><br/>Except trophies don't really indicate your skill. They indicate the skill of the teammates you are placed with. And I'm fine with playing against higher level brawlers, but when one team is all level 10 and the other team isn't, clearly it's unbalanced.<br/><br/>I reccomend getting some good friends to play with, me and 2 friends got my friends power 1 tick to rank 28 by playing gem grab with a certain composition all day and we made it without a single one of us being maxed with our brawlers.<br/><br/>I Know how you feel I used to have brawlers in high trophies with low level and it's to difficult to go more further and everything I was saying to myself "I want to have star powers" really supercell needs to make balance to the star powers or at least make a better matchmaking system.<br/><br/>I kinda feel this. I ain't as good at the game as you, but I got Emz to 500 at power 1 and the matchmaking was horrible. Maxed out players everywhere! And it didn't help that the majority of my teammates had around 5-8k trophies... I had to resort to solo showdown last minute because I can either ambush unsuspecting players or simply play a little aggressive at the right times. But I really wish that it could be a bit easier for people who want to push brawlers to really high trophy ranges without having the luxury of star powers.<br/><br/>Altho spike is still good without curveball. Curveball was just a help for hitting your shots more often as spike. But even before curveball was released, spike was a really strong brawler, so he will remain the same now.<br/><br/>I agree that they should have nerfed ambush, but I think they are trying to balance both Snappy Sniping and Ambush, as they are both getting merged with this change. She was becoming a little powerful, but still not nerf-worthy<br/><br/>I'm not sure about this, but now that Darryl got a noticeable buff, looking at their new stats, it looks like Darryl might overshadow Bull, as not only he can always deal more damage than Bull, he won't die as early anymore, so their survivability will be similar without star power (although Bull's survivability is still noticeably better than Darryl's if he had Tough Guy). Not only that, Darryl's super can auto regenerate, meaning Darryl MIGHT be able to be played effectively both as a heavyweight AND an assassin at the same time (before he sucks as a heavyweight but decent as an assassin)<br/><br/>But hes overrated af. And you get trophies with him really easily. So im kinda ok with the nerf. I havent even played him since when I got him to 500 (around 5 months ago), so not that I care that much either.<br/><br/>Why doesn't Poco/Penny get a HP nerf, if they are Marksman/Healer respectively not a tank?<br/>Why isn't Rosa's tankyness nerfed, cough 70% damage reduction?<br/>Why is Tick allowed to have the highest range and the most free pokedamage in the entire game?<br/>Why doesn't Leon get a HP/Damage buff?<br/><br/>Be that as it may, it was Ambush that was OP, not base Piper. I would argue that Ambush is the best star power in the game (now even more so since the percentage of damage increase indirectly went up) and base Piper was a bottom-10 brawler.<br/><br/>What Supercell should do is revert both nerfs, reduce Ambush to 600, and reduce Snappy Sniping to 0.25 since it'd be indirectly buffed by the base damage buff.<br/><br/>Yea and I believe they went a bit too far with Rosa, because now she is basically the better bull now when it comes to tanking, which she has been for a while. Now, Darryl might as well be a smaller, more powerful bull<br/><br/>Why? I feel she needs a buff in almost everything except her star power. Her health and speed make her super a bit more difficult to use, because she can die pretty easily, and it is really difficult for her to trap faster brawlers like Crow. Her star power is a bit broken though... | Supercell je nervira svađalice umjesto nervira zvjezdane moći. Bio sam na 750 prošle sezone s power 8 nita i to je vrlo teško proći da, kao, zvjezdane moći igraju stvarno dominantnu ulogu. Matchmaking je također smeće. Kada igram dragulj grab (oko 600 trofeja), tu su često utakmice gdje neprijateljska momčad ima jedan igrač više od nas koji je maksimizirao i to čak nije da imamo lvl 9 natjecati protiv toga. Ponekad postoje čak i utakmice u kojima je neprijateljska momčad u potpunosti maksimizirana i nitko od nas nije. to je razlog zašto više ne igram svađa zvijezde ozbiljno. Nije čak ni kao da nema mnogo igrača koji nisu maksimizirani i oko 600 trofeja. To je neugodno.<br/>Edit: Mislim da bi superćelija trebala imati barem osnovni mehanizam koji uzima prosjek razina svađalica pri postavljanju utakmica.<br/><br/>Osim što trofeji zapravo ne ukazuju na vašu vještinu. Oni ukazuju na vještinu suigrača s kojima ste postavljeni. I ja sam u redu s igranjem protiv svađača više razine, ali kada je jedna momčad na razini 10, a druga momčad nije, očito je neuravnotežena.<br/><br/>Preporučujem dobivanje dobrih prijatelja s kojima se igram, ja i 2 prijatelja dobili su moje prijatelje moć 1 krpelj na rang 28 igrajući dragulj grab s određenim sastavom cijeli dan i to smo napravili bez da se niti jedan od nas maksimira s našim svađalicama.<br/><br/>Znam kako se osjećate kada sam imao svađalice u visokim trofejima s niskom razinom i teško je ići dalje i sve što sam govorio sebi "Želim imati zvjezdane moći" stvarno superćelija treba balansirati zvjezdane moći ili barem napraviti bolji sustav matchmakinga.<br/><br/>Osjećam se nekako ovako. Nisam dobar u igri kao ti, ali dobio sam Emz na 500 na snazi 1 i matchmaking je bio užasan. Maks. igrači posvuda! I to nije pomoglo da je većina mojih suigrača imala oko 5-8k trofeja... Morao sam pribjeći solo obračunu u posljednjem trenutku jer mogu ili iz zasjede ničega sumnjivih igrača ili jednostavno igrati malo agresivno u pravo vrijeme. Ali stvarno bih volio da bi to moglo biti malo lakše za ljude koji žele gurnuti svađe do stvarno visokih raspona trofeja bez luksuza zvjezdanih moći.<br/><br/>Altho šiljak je još uvijek dobar bez curveballa. Curveball je bio samo pomoć za udaranje vaših udaraca češće kao šiljak. Ali čak i prije nego što je curveball pušten, šiljak je bio stvarno jak svađač, tako da će sada ostati isti.<br/><br/>Slažem se da su trebali nervirao zasjedu, ali mislim da pokušavaju uravnotežiti i Snappy Sniping i Ambush, kao što su obje se spajaju s ovom promjenom. Ona je postala malo moćan, ali još uvijek nije živčan-vrijedna<br/><br/>Nisam siguran za to, ali sada kada je Darryl dobio uočljivu ljubav, gledajući njihove nove statistike, izgleda da bi Darryl mogao zasjeniti Bulla, jer ne samo da uvijek može nanijeti više štete od Bulla, on više neće umrijeti tako da će njihova preživljavanje biti slično bez zvjezdane snage (iako je Bullova preživljavanje još uvijek primjetno bolje od Darrylovog T Guya). Ne samo to, Darrylov super može se automatski regenerirati, što znači da bi se Darryl mogao učinkovito igrati i kao teškaš i ubojica u isto vrijeme (prije nego što je sisao kao teškaš, ali pristojan kao ubojica)<br/><br/>Ali on je precijenjen af. A vi ćete dobiti trofeje s njim stvarno lako. Tako da sam nekako ok s živcem. Nisam ga ni igrao od kada sam ga dobio na 500 (prije oko 5 mjeseci), tako da ne da mi je stalo toliko.<br/><br/>Zašto Poco/Penny ne dobije HP živac, ako su Marksman/Iscjelitelj odnosno ne tenk?<br/>Zašto Rosina tankost nije živčana, kašalj 70% smanjenje štete?<br/>Zašto je Ticku dopušteno imati najviši domet i najslobodniji pokedamage u cijeloj igri?<br/>Zašto Leon ne dobije HP/Damage buff?<br/><br/>Bilo kako bilo, to je bila zasjeda koja je bila OP, a ne baza Piper. Ja bih tvrdio da je Ambush najbolja zvijezda snaga u igri (sada još više jer je postotak povećanja štete neizravno porastao) i baza Piper bila je donja 10 svađalica.<br/><br/>Ono što bi Supercell trebao učiniti je preokrenuti oba živca, smanjiti Ambush na 600, i smanjiti Snappy Sniping na 0,25 jer bi ga indirektno napunio osnovni buff štete.<br/><br/>Da i ja vjerujem da su otišli malo predaleko s Rosom, jer sada je ona u osnovi bolji bik sada kada je u pitanju tankiranje, što je već neko vrijeme. Sada, Darryl bi mogao biti manji, moćniji bik<br/><br/>Zašto? Osjećam da joj je potreban buff u gotovo svemu osim njezine zvijezde snage. Njezino zdravlje i brzina čine ju super malo teže koristiti, jer ona može umrijeti prilično lako, a to je stvarno teško za nju uhvatiti brže svađalice poput Crow. Njezina zvijezda moć je malo slomljena iako... |

| Self-Employment Part 1<br/><br/>When you accept an employment in any organisation, you have to perform various jobs as per the requirements of your employer and you may get a fixed amount of income as salary. You may run a small retail shop, tailoring shop, restaurant, bakery and confectionery, beauty salon, etc. in your locality. You may get engaged in trading or manufacturing on a small scale or providing some service for a price. Such economic activities are known as self-employment.<br/><br/>Meaning of Self-Employment<br/><br/>Earning is necessary for a living. Our father, mother, brothers, sisters and others may be engaged in different economic activities through which they earn their livelihood. These persons are engaged in an economic activity which is termed as wage employment or paid employment. But there are many persons who engage themselves in an occupation or some business which they start and manage on their own. They put in their best effort and take all types of risks to pursue their careers successfully. The entire earning of their work goes to them. All of us have seen small grocery shops, tailoring shops, medical stores etc. in our locality. These are owned and managed by a person, with or without the help of some assistants. Their economic activities are termed as self-employment. So, when an individual engages in any economic activity and manages it on his own, it is known as self-employment.<br/><br/>Objectives<br/><br/>After studying this lesson, you will be able to:<br/><br/>Image of Objectives<br/><br/>Image of Objectives<br/><br/>Characteristics of Self-Employment<br/><br/>It involves ownership and management of activities by a person although he/she may take the help of one or two persons to assist him/her. Thus, self-employment may provide employment to other persons as well.<br/><br/>The earning from self-employment is not fixed. It depends on the income one can earn by producing or buying and selling goods or providing services to others at a price.<br/><br/>In self-employment, the owner alone has to take the profit and bear the risk of loss. So, we find a direct link between the effort and reward in self-employment.<br/><br/>It requires some amount of capital investment, although it may be small.<br/><br/>In self-employment, a person is free to take decisions in respect of running his business profitably and avail of any opportunity that may come up for expansion of his business. It gives complete freedom to work as per one's own will and within the parameters of the prevailing laws.<br/><br/>Thus, self-employment may be defined as, an economic activity which one may perform on his own as a gainful occupation, and this may consist of producing and selling goods, buying and selling goods, or rendering services for a price. | Samozapošljavanje 1. dio<br/><br/>Kada prihvatite posao u bilo kojoj organizaciji, morate obavljati različite poslove prema zahtjevima vašeg poslodavca i možete dobiti fiksni iznos prihoda kao plaću.
