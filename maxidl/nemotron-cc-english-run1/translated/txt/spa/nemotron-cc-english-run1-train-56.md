| While acknowledging that it's impossible to argue someone into loving something they hate, and vice versa, it's still often enjoyable to attempt the argument. When we talk to people whose opinions directly contradict ours, we're forced to defend our tastes, define our opinions, and analyze why we react the way we do. Which is why we have Why Don't You Like This?, in which two of our staffers will attempt to discover whether people with opposing opinions can get beyond "No, you're wrong!" and have a civil, constructive, and possibly even convincing discussion about their points of contention. Because no matter what talk radio says, there's still a middle ground between "We agree utterly" and "I'm right, and you're stupid and evil."<br/><br/>Scott: Since discussing my Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World apostasy, we've been looking for a case where I can call you out for not liking something wonderful, and we didn't have to look for long. We were sitting right next to each other during Martin Scorsese's Hugo—me, utterly enchanted by its fantastical tribute to the wonders of early silent cinema, and you, apparently resisting it at every turn. Critical consensus has been on my side: It hit the No. 9 spot on our collective Top 15 (though you listed it as your Overrated choice), has won (or placed) in various film-critic awards, and currently enjoys an 83 score on Metacritic. That doesn't mean you're wrong, of course, but the onus is on you to explain why Hugo was, in your words, "hollow and artificial," where many of us saw it as a lovely evocation of Scorsese's childhood and the medium when it was still in its infancy. And please be gentle as you rip this butterfly apart by the wings.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Tasha: I can't be gentle, Scott. Sometimes it hurts less if you rip the Band-Aid off all at once. (And even if it doesn't, who wants to walk around wearing a half-ripped-off Band-Aid? Gross.) The fact is, I found Hugo to be a wearyingly manipulative exercise in fakery, starting from its opening glide through a Paris train station, which reminded me more than anything of Robert Zemeckis' The Polar Express. Unlike Mike D'Angelo, I'm a fan of long, unbroken takes as a way of establishing a space and encouraging viewers to unconsciously hold their breaths as a camera explores an area; but when the space being explored is a slick, shiny CGI creation, and the camera floats weightlessly through it with no physical sense that either the camera or the surroundings are really there, that exploration starts to feel like watching someone else play a videogame. And the rest of the film felt similarly poreless and unreal to me, both in terms of its setting and in terms of its highly contrived, maudlin story.<br/><br/>I don't necessarily have a problem with manufactured, stylized environments in film. I loved Baz Luhrmann's equally sprawling, utterly artificial take on Paris in Moulin Rouge, for instance, but that film has a sense of its own ridiculousness, a sense of humor about how deliberately over-the-top it is. Ditto the stylization of Jean-Pierre Jeunet, particularly in Amélie. (Both Jeunet and Luhrmann felt like strong visual influences here.) I got the sense, however, that Martin Scorsese wanted me to take Hugo entirely seriously. Even though it's yet another achingly sentimental story about a plucky orphan bringing color back into the life of a grumpy old curmudgeon. And I just couldn't.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>There is nothing I enjoy more in film than being surprised. And there's nothing I resent and resist more than being overtly manipulated, being loudly told what to feel and when to feel it. A good film does this kind of thing subtly; a bad one uses crashing music cues and sweet strings—and in this case, a grubby, huge-eyed, disheveled orphan staring woefully at the camera—to demand pathos, and to tell viewers they're horrible people if they don't serve it up on demand. That said, I can deal with sad kids and grumpy adults making life better for each other—I really dug this year's Le Havre, which was essentially the same plot without all the cutesiness—but I find the artificial environments reflect badly on the artificial emotions, and each makes the other seem more fake by turns.<br/><br/>Let's start with that. In our overlooked films video, you and Noel both took Keith to task for championing Tyrannosaur, because you felt it wasn't realistic enough—too contrived, too miserablist, too much, too far. How is it possible that you can't buy a stymied old crank who breaks things when he's angry, but you can buy an orphan living inside a giant train-station clock and embarking upon a whimsical journey to repair a mysterious automaton that he believes might bear secrets from his dead father, but which instead leads him on a quirky voyage of self-discovery, into the magical land of cinema? Did you never find Hugo's gaudy rococo design, aggressive heartstring-plucking, or wheelbarrow-loads of quirk even a little excessive or hard to swallow?<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Scott: Jeunet and Luhrmann as influences on Scorsese?! Forget being indelicate, now you're deliberately poking me with a sharp stick. If you're looking for inspirations for Hugo—indeed, if you're looking for the emotional core of Hugo—you have to go back to Scorsese's childhood on Elizabeth Street in Little Italy, where an asthmatic little boy, unable to play outside with the other kids, retreated to Alexander Korda fantasies like The Thief Of Bagdad. Or, more simply, just go straight to the source himself: George Méliès, whose A Trip To The Moon remains the Big Bang of all cinematic fantasies, that moment when the camera was not used to document the world as it is, but whatever whimsical, magical, transporting place a filmmaker wants to invent for it. And that tradition has been developed and expanded upon for decades before the likes of Jeunet and Luhrmann got their grubby little paws on it.<br/><br/>And speaking of Jeunet, nice attempt to take away my rhetorical weapon, but I'll say it anyway: How can you love Amélie, yet find Hugo synthetic and "excessive" and "wearyingly manipulative"? You say that Amélie and Moulin Rouge have redeeming "sense of [their] own ridiculousness" where Scorsese means us to take Hugo seriously, and I don't think that's the case, at least on the latter point. That Scorsese feels evident passion about the movies is, I suppose, why you'd interpret Hugo as self-serious. But to me, it's those feelings that give the film an emotional ballast that the Luhrmann and Jeunet films don't have. All three films make aggressive use of the marvels of CGI—and Scorsese adds 3D to the mix, to wonderful effect—but where you and I differ is on the issue of weightlessness. I agree that CGI has a distancing effect; worlds composed entirely of digital plasticine are flexible to the point where they sometimes have no presence. You referred to Hugo in your "Overrated" entry for our Best Of Film piece as "a CGI gimcrack"—a perfect dis… for another movie.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>It's fair to say that Scorsese has built Hugo around a standard-issue, "heartstring-plucking" children's book/movie plot: Orphan misses his daddy, creates his own little fantasy world, gloms onto a new friend, convinces a crusty old fuddy-duddy to soften up and maybe adopt him. But that's just the narrative skeleton, and Scorsese provides plenty of flesh and blood. For one, you can't watch Hugo, the lonely boy, peering out from clock towers to the hustle-and-bustle of a Paris train station without thinking of Scorsese, another lonely boy, staring out of his bedroom window on Elizabeth Street. And even if you're not a big enough film nerd to make that connection, I really feel like Hugo's journey is not in finding a new father figure, but in persisting with the mechanical magic that stands as his own father's legacy. That's what film is: The persistence of vision that allows us to accept an illusory version of the world at 24 frames per second is science and magic at once. Hugo's relationship with Méliès isn't about him cozying up to a new daddy, but sharing a common enthusiasm the old man has submerged in bitterness. To me, that's a far more unique angle on a potentially shopworn premise.<br/><br/>Did you really find none of Hugo enchanting? Even the film's few detractors seem willing to admit that the sequences evoking cinema history and Méliès' studio—with Michael Stuhlbarg as the heroic film scholar!—were terrific. It felt, in the best possible way, like a heady compression of my History Of Film 101 class in college, condensing a semester's worth of clips and context into something between a montage and an animated pop-up book. And it speaks to the ingenious design of the film, which layers fact and fantasy so beautifully that it's at once a history of Méliès and the birth of cinema, and just the sort of simple, sumptuously produced cinematic wonder that Scorsese himself would have loved as a child. Thank goodness Hugo doesn't follow the Jeunet/Luhrmann model and have "a sense of its own ridiculousness." As a fantasy connoisseur yourself, wouldn't you say there's value in playing it straight and earnest and unabashed rather than winking at the audience? You may find Hugo sickly sweet, but I don't think the authenticity of its sentiment is to be denied.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Tasha: Yes, I did in fact find parts of Hugo enchanting. (Notice how I'm answering your question up front, whereas you were too busy frothing with apoplexy to address mine, though I assume that's an answer in its own right. Okay, "influence" may be overstating the case—I just meant the visual style looked very familiar. Though as Keith pointed out when you brought this up in person, Scorsese is neither opposed to drawing inspiration from other people's visuals, nor immune to it.) Primarily, I was enchanted by the parts dealing with Georges Méliès' backstory, with his love of cinema, with the work he put into his art and the joy he got out of it. There's an awful lot of beauty and fun in the staging of the underwater-court scene from Méliès' "Fairyland," and in the sequence at the end, focusing on Méliès footage. I'll grant you that Hugo's connection with Méliès over a shared love of film is a nice touch. And I do enjoy a good film about filmmaking.<br/><br/>But Hugo isn't primarily about film, in spite of the Méliès tie-ins. In addition to the themes you cite, it's also about finding your purpose, as the characters expressly, laboriously explain to each other and to us. And it's about spectacle, and big action setpieces, and chases, and happily-ever-after endings where even the angry bully and the shy older couple and fergawdsakes even the cranky dachshund all get paired off with charming love interests by the end. It's about the super-precocious Hermione Granger-type being bossy and perky and clever and praising the magical worlds encased in books. And all of this business is mighty familiar, and mighty artificial.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Yes, Scorsese is playing with archetypes. Problem is, I never felt he imbued them with anything new, fresh, or believable, in spite of his own backstory. I would have much preferred a story about a young Scorsese growing up with asthma—something small-scale and real, without vast rooms full of CGI clockwork and golden glowing dust-motes and prophetic dreams and a raging adult tyrant-guard with a heart of gold—all of that outsized, over-the-top nonsense. You keep citing Scorsese's personal background and love of film as evidence that he's really feeling what he's putting on the screen, but I don't feel his personal touch in any of this, except the moments that are expressly about film. The core emotions may be real, but that doesn't make the execution less false.<br/><br/>You say the authenticity of the emotion isn't to be denied. I don't question whether Scorsese personally felt lonely and isolated as a child, but I don't feel loneliness and isolation on the screen—I see a bunch of exaggerated signifiers (Hugo is filthy and his clothes are worn and all the adults yell at him and he regularly gets chased by a scary dog!) and big beats, with shouting and weeping and Spielbergian wonder-emoting. For me, sincerity is more convincing and more personal when it's quiet and direct; when someone's shouting his opinions at me, I assume he's either really angry, or just trying to overwhelm my senses to keep me from expressing my own opinion. Hugo was one long shout, as far as I was concerned.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Why didn't I get that sense of fakery from Amélie, you ask? Actually, I did. I'll completely acknowledge that Amélie and Moulin Rouge are both big, manipulative, artificial constructions in the exact same vein, demanding specific emotions at specific intervals, and trying to sell those emotions with heavy emoting and aggressive soundtrack prodding. Neither of them really sold me on their emotions as authentic human feeling. What I enjoyed in those two films was the construction—particularly Amélie's heady, laughable lists of random characterizing features and experiences for its cast, and Moulin Rouge's musical-magpie mashups and recontextualizations. I'm often sold on stories that do creative or ambitious things with structure, and both of those movies qualify, where Hugo is a much more linear, standard kid-quest.<br/><br/>But in the end, for me, it really does come down to a feeling that those movies are goofs, whereas Hugo is meant to be taken seriously at every treacly moment. You don't think that's true—but you're simultaneously defending its integrity in terms of its absolutely authentic, rooted-in-Scorsese's-history emotion, and telling me I'm wrong, and he doesn't mean it to be taken seriously. How do you reconcile those two statements? What about the film suggests to you that it isn't meant to be taken at face value? And is it possible this is just another Curious Case Of Benjamin Button-like situation where I find the use of kids in big-budget films to be largely sappy and melodramatic, whereas you as a dad find it bypasses your cynicism and goes straight to your family-feeling?<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Scott: Not sure I meant that Scorsese doesn't mean to be taken seriously; it's just that he's chosen a whimsical vehicle through which to express a serious love of the movies. When you say, "But Hugo isn't primarily about film, in spite of the Méliès tie-ins," I'm mystified. I grant that you find many elements of Hugo overly familiar and laborious and full of Spielbergian wonder-emoting—there's nothing I can do to argue around that perception, which other Hugo doubters share. Sometimes a film means to charm and enchant, and it doesn't for some; you've got Hugo and I've got Amélie, though I think the latter, deliberately artificial as it is, means for us to find it romantic. (Rather than, say, some horrible mechanical contraption fit for a Saw sequel.)<br/><br/>But to say Hugo isn't primarily about film? If it's not about film, then it's the most pointlessly discursive story about [whatever you think it's about] I've ever seen. The relationship between Hugo and Méliès is the heart of the movie, and at the heart of that is not just some stock connection between Plucky Orphan and Crusty Old Guy With A Heart Of Gold, but a shared affinity for engineered magic—specifically the magic of the movies. I think Scorsese and his collaborators have found a way to express their enthusiasm over the early days of cinema through a fantasy that's accessible to all ages. The archetype-filled children's tale is the merely the crust here; cinema is the pie. (Mmmm… pie.)<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>As for The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button, I don't see much of a connection, other than trying to expose me as a Benjamin Button defender as a way of damaging my credibility. (Incidentally, how are the extras on that G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra Blu-ray?) I've said to you that the sleep-deprived new dad in me was perhaps vulnerable to Benjamin Button, but I can't imagine a time when the premise of aging in reverse wouldn't move me. (Cradling the love of your life in your arms as an infant? How can you not be affected by that?) And besides, I don't see how Benjamin Button relates much to Hugo as a film concerning kids, since that's just a small segment of a story that spans a much larger trajectory.<br/><br/>So have I convinced you? Likely not. But I'm happy to learn that Hugo wasn't entirely devoid of enchantments for you. The sequences on Méliès the filmmaker are what put Hugo over for me—and in that, at least, we can share some movie love.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Tasha: Nope, I can't say you've convinced me, any more than I've convinced you. It's impossible to argue anyone into a visceral love of anything, and it really should be equally impossible to talk someone down from visceral love. Mostly, you've let me see Hugo in Scott-O-Vision, which is an interesting experience; at least now I'm mildly convinced that we didn't somehow manage to see entirely different films which both somehow had the same name and director.<br/><br/>We certainly had different experiences, though, and to my mind, focused on different aspects of the production: I still don't see the "film is marvelous" theme as the movie's single strand, so much as one among too many. "Pointlessly discursive" almost covers it, though I'd throw in "often needlessly cutesy and precious" on top of that. While you're focused on the film's tasty pie filling, I feel like that pie was covered with a pound of crystallized sugar, and I think that does make a difference, regardless of the film's core message or handful of terrific scenes. See also Benjamin Button, which I did not bring up just to chafe you—I really do think you have more of a sentimental streak than I do regarding children in cinema, especially when they're used more as symbols of vulnerability and innocence than as human characters. Hey, you know what film totally does not have cute wide-eyed moppets bringing hope to a cynical world? G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra. Maybe I will go watch those Blu-ray extras. I could use some explosion-insulin to compensate for Hugo's sweetness. | Si bien reconoce que es imposible argumentar a alguien para que ame algo que odia, y viceversa, a menudo es agradable intentar la discusión. Cuando hablamos con personas cuyas opiniones contradicen directamente las nuestras, nos vemos obligados a defender nuestros gustos, definir nuestras opiniones y analizar por qué reaccionamos de la manera en que lo hacemos. Es por eso que tenemos ¿Por qué no te gusta esto?, en el que dos de nuestros empleados intentarán descubrir si las personas con opiniones opuestas pueden ir más allá de "¡No, estás equivocado!" y tener una discusión civil, constructiva y posiblemente incluso convincente sobre sus puntos de contención. Porque no importa lo que diga la radio, todavía hay un punto medio entre "Estamos totalmente de acuerdo" y "Tengo razón, y eres estúpido y malvado".<br/><br/>Scott: Desde que discutí mi Scott Pilgrim Vs. La apostasía mundial, hemos estado buscando un caso en el que pueda llamarte por no gustarte algo maravilloso, y no tuvimos que buscar por mucho tiempo. Estábamos sentados uno al lado del otro durante el Hugo-me de Martin Scorsese, completamente encantados por su fantástico tributo a las maravillas del cine mudo temprano, y tú, aparentemente resistiéndote a cada paso. El consenso crítico ha estado de mi lado: alcanzó el puesto número 9 en nuestro colectivo Top 15 (aunque lo enumeraste como tu opción sobrevalorada), ha ganado (o colocado) en varios premios de crítica cinematográfica y actualmente disfruta de una puntuación de 83 en Metacritic. Eso no significa que estés equivocado, por supuesto, pero la responsabilidad recae en ti para explicar por qué Hugo era, en tus palabras, "hueco y artificial", donde muchos de nosotros lo vimos como una encantadora evocación de la infancia de Scorsese y el medio cuando todavía estaba en su infancia. Y por favor sea amable mientras desgarra esta mariposa por las alas.<br/><br/>Publicidad<br/><br/>Tasha: No puedo ser gentil, Scott. A veces duele menos si te quitas la curita de una vez. (Y aunque no sea así, ¿quién quiere caminar por ahí usando una curita a medio rasguear? El hecho es que me pareció que Hugo era un ejercicio agotador de manipulación de la falsificación, a partir de su deslizamiento de apertura a través de una estación de tren de París, que me recordó más que nada de Robert Zemeckis 'The Polar Express. A diferencia de Mike D'Angelo, soy un fanático de las tomas largas e ininterrumpidas como una forma de establecer un espacio y alentar a los espectadores a contener la respiración inconscientemente mientras una cámara explora un área; pero cuando el espacio que se está explorando es una brillante y brillante creación de CGI, y la cámara flota ingrávidamente a través de ella sin sentido físico de que la cámara o los alrededores están realmente allí, esa exploración comienza a sentirse como ver a otra persona jugar un videojuego. Y el resto de la película se sentía similarmente sin poros e irreal para mí, tanto en términos de su entorno como en términos de su historia muy artificial.<br/><br/>No necesariamente tengo un problema con los entornos manufacturados y estilizados en el cine. Me encantó la visión igualmente extensa y completamente artificial de Baz Luhrmann sobre París en Moulin Rouge, por ejemplo, pero esa película tiene un sentido de su propia ridiculez, un sentido del humor sobre cuán deliberadamente exagerada es. Lo mismo sucedió con la estilización de Jean-Pierre Jeunet, particularmente en Amélie. (Tanto Jeunet como Luhrmann se sintieron fuertes influencias visuales aquí). Sin embargo, tuve la sensación de que Martin Scorsese quería que tomara a Hugo completamente en serio. A pesar de que es otra historia dolorosamente sentimental sobre un huérfano valiente que devuelve el color a la vida de un viejo cascarrabias gruñón.<br/><br/>Publicidad<br/><br/>No hay nada que disfrute más en el cine que ser sorprendido, y no hay nada que me resista más que ser manipulado abiertamente, que me digan en voz alta qué sentir y cuándo sentirlo. Una buena película hace este tipo de cosas sutilmente; una mala usa señales musicales chocantes y cuerdas dulces, y en este caso, un huérfano sucio, de ojos enormes y desaliñado mirando tristemente a la cámara, para exigir pathos y decirle a los espectadores que son personas horribles si no lo sirven a pedido. Dicho esto, puedo lidiar con niños tristes y adultos malhumorados que mejoran la vida el uno para el otro, realmente cavé el Le Havre de este año, que era esencialmente la misma trama sin toda la ternura, pero encuentro que los entornos artificiales se reflejan mal en las emociones artificiales, y cada uno hace que el otro parezca más falso por turnos.<br/><br/>En nuestro video de películas pasadas por alto, tú y Noel llevaron a Keith a la tarea por defender el Tiranosaurio, porque sentías que no era lo suficientemente realista, demasiado artificial, demasiado miserable, demasiado, demasiado lejos. ¿Cómo es posible que no puedas comprar a un viejo maniático que rompe cosas cuando está enojado, pero puedes comprar a un huérfano que vive dentro de un reloj gigante de una estación de tren y se embarca en un viaje caprichoso para reparar a un misterioso autómata que cree que podría tener secretos de su padre muerto, pero que en cambio lo lleva a un viaje peculiar de autodescubrimiento, a la tierra mágica del cine? ¿Nunca encontraste el llamativo diseño rococó de Hugo, el agresivo desplome de las cuerdas del corazón o las cargas de carretillas de peculiaridad, incluso un poco excesivas o difíciles de tragar?<br/><br/>Publicidad<br/><br/>Scott: Jeunet y Luhrmann como influencias en Scorsese?! Olvídate de ser indelicado, ahora me estás pinchando deliberadamente con un palo afilado. Si estás buscando inspiración para Hugo, de hecho, si estás buscando el núcleo emocional de Hugo, tienes que volver a la infancia de Scorsese en Elizabeth Street en Little Italy, donde un niño asmático, incapaz de jugar afuera con los otros niños, se retiró a Alexander Korda fantasías como El ladrón de Bagdad. O, más simplemente, vaya directamente a la fuente: George Méliés, cuyo Viaje a la Luna sigue siendo el Big Bang de todas las fantasías cinematográficas, ese momento en que la cámara no se usó para documentar el mundo tal como es, sino cualquier lugar caprichoso, mágico y de transporte que un cineasta quiera inventar para él. Y esa tradición se ha desarrollado y ampliado durante décadas antes de que gente como Jeunet y Luhrmann pusieran sus pequeñas y sucias patas en ella.<br/><br/>Y hablando de Jeunet, buen intento de quitarme mi arma retórica, pero lo diré de todos modos: ¿Cómo puedes amar a Amélie, pero encontrar a Hugo sintético y "excesivo" y "cansancio manipulador"? Dices que Amélie y Moulin Rouge tienen un "sentido de su propia ridiculez" en el que Scorsese quiere que tomemos a Hugo en serio, y no creo que ese sea el caso, al menos en este último punto. Supongo que el hecho de que Scorsese sienta una evidente pasión por las películas es la razón por la que interpretarías a Hugo como alguien serio, pero para mí son esos sentimientos los que le dan a la película un lastre emocional que las películas de Luhrmann y Jeunet no tienen. Las tres películas hacen un uso agresivo de las maravillas de CGI, y Scorsese agrega 3D a la mezcla, con un efecto maravilloso, pero donde tú y yo diferimos es en el tema de la ingravidez. Estoy de acuerdo en que el CGI tiene un efecto distanciador; los mundos compuestos completamente de plastilina digital son flexibles hasta el punto en que a veces no tienen presencia. Usted se refirió a Hugo en su entrada "Sobrevalorado" para nuestra pieza Best Of Film como "un gimcrack CGI", una perfecta dis... para otra película.<br/><br/>Publicidad<br/><br/>Es justo decir que Scorsese ha construido a Hugo en torno a una trama estándar de libros / películas para niños: Huérfano extraña a su papá, crea su propio pequeño mundo de fantasía, se acerca a un nuevo amigo, convence a un viejo y crujiente fuddy para que lo suavice y tal vez lo adopte. Pero eso es solo el esqueleto narrativo, y Scorsese proporciona mucha carne y sangre. Por un lado, no se puede ver a Hugo, el niño solitario, mirando desde las torres del reloj al ajetreo y el bullicio de una estación de tren de París sin pensar en Scorsese, otro niño solitario, mirando por la ventana de su dormitorio en Elizabeth Street. E incluso si no eres un nerd lo suficientemente grande como para hacer esa conexión, realmente siento que el viaje de Hugo no es encontrar una nueva figura paterna, sino persistir con la magia mecánica que se erige como el legado de su propio padre. Eso es lo que es el cine: la persistencia de la visión que nos permite aceptar una versión ilusoria del mundo a 24 cuadros por segundo es ciencia y magia a la vez. No se trata de que Hugo se sienta cómodo con un nuevo padre, sino de que comparta el entusiasmo común que el viejo ha sumergido en la amargura.<br/><br/>Incluso los pocos detractores de la película parecen dispuestos a admitir que las secuencias que evocan la historia del cine y el estudio de Méliés, con Michael Stuhlbarg como el heroico estudioso del cine, fueron geniales. Se sentía, de la mejor manera posible, como una compresión embriagadora de mi clase de History Of Film 101 en la universidad, condensando un semestre de clips y contexto en algo entre un montaje y un libro pop-up animado. Y habla del ingenioso diseño de la película, que combina la realidad y la fantasía tan bellamente que es a la vez una historia de Méliés y el nacimiento del cine, y el tipo de maravilla cinematográfica simple y suntuosamente producida que el propio Scorsese hubiera amado cuando era niño. Gracias a Dios Hugo no sigue el modelo de Jeunet / Luhrmann y tiene "un sentido de su propia ridiculez". Como un conocedor de la fantasía a ti mismo, ¿no dirías que hay valor en jugar recto y serio y desvergonzado en lugar de guiñar un ojo a la audiencia? Usted puede encontrar Hugo enfermizo dulce, pero no creo que la autenticidad de su sentimiento es para ser negado.<br/><br/>Publicidad<br/><br/>Tasha: Sí, de hecho encontré partes de Hugo encantadoras. (Note cómo estoy respondiendo su pregunta por adelantado, mientras que usted estaba demasiado ocupado espumando con apoplejía para abordar la mía, aunque asumo que es una respuesta en sí misma. De acuerdo, "influencia" puede estar exagerando el caso, solo quería decir que el estilo visual parecía muy familiar. Aunque como Keith señaló cuando mencionaste esto en persona, Scorsese no se opone a inspirarse en las imágenes de otras personas, ni es inmune a ello.) En primer lugar, me encantaron las partes relacionadas con la historia de fondo de Georges Méliés, con su amor por el cine, con el trabajo que puso en su arte y la alegría que obtuvo de él. Hay una gran cantidad de belleza y diversión en la puesta en escena de la escena de la corte submarina de "Fairyland" de Méli's, y en la secuencia al final, centrándose en las imágenes de Méli's. Les concedo que la conexión de Hugo con Mélié por un amor compartido por el cine es un buen toque, y disfruto de una buena película sobre cine.<br/><br/>Pero Hugo no se trata principalmente de cine, a pesar de los tie-ins de Méliés. Además de los temas que cita, también se trata de encontrar su propósito, como los personajes expresamente, laboriosamente se explican entre sí y a nosotros. Y se trata de espectáculo, y grandes jugadas de acción, y persecuciones, y finales felices para siempre donde incluso el acosador enojado y la tímida pareja mayor y ferrawdsakes incluso el dachshund malhumorado se emparejan con encantadores intereses amorosos al final. Se trata del superprecocio Hermione Granger siendo mandona, alegre e inteligente y elogiando los mundos mágicos encerrados en los libros.<br/><br/>Publicidad<br/><br/>Sí, Scorsese está jugando con arquetipos. El problema es que nunca sentí que los imbuyó de nada nuevo, fresco o creíble, a pesar de su propia historia de fondo. Hubiera preferido mucho más una historia sobre un joven Scorsese que crece con asma, algo a pequeña escala y real, sin vastas habitaciones llenas de relojes CGI y motas de polvo doradas y sueños proféticos y un tirano adulto furioso con un corazón de oro, todas esas tonterías exageradas y exageradas. Sigues citando los antecedentes personales de Scorsese y el amor por el cine como evidencia de que realmente está sintiendo lo que está poniendo en la pantalla, pero no siento su toque personal en nada de esto, excepto los momentos que son expresamente sobre el cine. Las emociones centrales pueden ser reales, pero eso no hace que la ejecución sea menos falsa.<br/><br/>Usted dice que la autenticidad de la emoción no debe ser negada. No me pregunto si Scorsese personalmente se sintió solo y aislado cuando era niño, pero no siento soledad y aislamiento en la pantalla: veo un montón de significantes exagerados (Hugo está sucio y su ropa está gastada y todos los adultos le gritan y regularmente es perseguido por un perro aterrador!) Para mí, la sinceridad es más convincente y más personal cuando es tranquila y directa; cuando alguien me grita sus opiniones, asumo que está realmente enojado, o simplemente tratando de abrumar mis sentidos para evitar que exprese mi propia opinión. Hugo fue un grito largo, en lo que a mí respecta.<br/><br/>Publicidad<br/><br/>¿Por qué no recibí esa sensación de falsedad de parte de Amélie? Reconozco completamente que Amélie y Moulin Rouge son construcciones grandes, manipuladoras y artificiales en la misma línea, que exigen emociones específicas a intervalos específicos e intentan vender esas emociones con fuertes emociones y una banda sonora agresiva. Ninguno de ellos realmente me vendió sus emociones como auténtico sentimiento humano. Lo que disfruté en esas dos películas fue la construcción, particularmente las listas embriagadoras e irrisorias de Amélie de características y experiencias aleatorias para su elenco, y los mashups y recontextualizaciones musical-magpie de Moulin Rouge. A menudo me venden historias que hacen cosas creativas o ambiciosas con la estructura, y ambas películas califican, donde Hugo es un niño mucho más lineal y estándar.<br/><br/>Pero al final, para mí, realmente se reduce a la sensación de que esas películas son tontas, mientras que Hugo está destinado a ser tomado en serio en cada momento. No crees que eso sea cierto, pero simultáneamente estás defendiendo su integridad en términos de su emoción absolutamente auténtica, arraigada en la historia de Scorsese, y diciéndome que estoy equivocado, y él no quiere decir que se lo tome en serio. ¿Cómo concilias esas dos afirmaciones? ¿Qué hay de la película que te sugiere que no está destinada a ser tomada al pie de la letra? ¿Y es posible que esta sea solo otra situación similar a Curious Case Of Benjamin Button en la que encuentro que el uso de niños en películas de gran presupuesto es en gran medida sensible y melodramático, mientras que usted como padre lo encuentra pasando por alto su cinismo y va directamente a su sentimiento familiar?<br/><br/>Publicidad<br/><br/>Scott: No estoy seguro de querer decir que Scorsese no quiere ser tomado en serio; es solo que ha elegido un vehículo caprichoso a través del cual expresar un amor serio por las películas. Cuando dices: "Pero Hugo no se trata principalmente de cine, a pesar de los vínculos de Méli's", estoy desconcertado. Le concedo que encuentre muchos elementos de Hugo demasiado familiares y laboriosos y llenos de emociones de asombro de Spielberg: no hay nada que pueda hacer para discutir sobre esa percepción, que otros escépticos de Hugo comparten. A veces una película significa encantar y encantar, y no lo hace para algunos; tienes a Hugo y yo a Amélie, aunque creo que esto último, deliberadamente artificial como es, significa que lo encontremos romántico. (En lugar de, digamos, algún horrible artilugio mecánico adecuado para una secuela de Saw).<br/><br/>Pero decir que Hugo no se trata principalmente de cine, si no se trata de cine, entonces es la historia más discursiva sin sentido sobre [lo que sea que pienses que se trata] que he visto. La relación entre Hugo y Méliés es el corazón de la película, y en el corazón de eso no es solo una conexión entre Plucky Orphan y Crusty Old Guy With A Heart Of Gold, sino una afinidad compartida por la magia de ingeniería, específicamente la magia de las películas. Creo que Scorsese y sus colaboradores han encontrado una manera de expresar su entusiasmo durante los primeros días del cine a través de una fantasía que es accesible a todas las edades. El cuento infantil lleno de arquetipos es la corteza aquí; el cine es el pastel. (Mmmm... pastel.)<br/><br/>Publicidad<br/><br/>En cuanto a El curioso caso de Benjamin Button, no veo mucha conexión, aparte de tratar de exponerme como un defensor de Benjamin Button como una forma de dañar mi credibilidad. (Por cierto, ¿cómo son los extras en ese G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra Blu-ray?) Te he dicho que el nuevo padre privado de sueño en mí era quizás vulnerable a Benjamin Button, pero no puedo imaginar un momento en el que la premisa de envejecer a la inversa no me conmoviera. Y además, no veo cómo Benjamin Button se relaciona mucho con Hugo como una película sobre niños, ya que eso es solo un pequeño segmento de una historia que abarca una trayectoria mucho más grande.<br/><br/>Así que te he convencido? Probablemente no. Pero estoy feliz de saber que Hugo no estaba del todo desprovisto de encantos para ti. Las secuencias en Méli's el cineasta son lo que puso a Hugo para mí, y en eso, al menos, podemos compartir un poco de amor por el cine.<br/><br/>Publicidad<br/><br/>Tasha: No, no puedo decir que me hayas convencido, más de lo que yo te he convencido, es imposible argumentar a nadie en un amor visceral de cualquier cosa, y realmente debería ser igualmente imposible convencer a alguien por amor visceral. Sobre todo, me has dejado ver a Hugo en Scott-O-Vision, que es una experiencia interesante; al menos ahora estoy ligeramente convencido de que de alguna manera no logramos ver películas completamente diferentes que de alguna manera tuvieran el mismo nombre y director.<br/><br/>Sin embargo, ciertamente tuvimos diferentes experiencias, y en mi opinión, nos centramos en diferentes aspectos de la producción: todavía no veo el tema de "la película es maravillosa" como el único hilo de la película, tanto como uno entre demasiados. "Pointlessly discursive" casi lo cubre, aunque yo añadiría "a menudo innecesariamente monada y preciosa" encima de eso. Mientras te enfocas en el sabroso relleno de pastel de la película, siento que ese pastel estaba cubierto con una libra de azúcar cristalizada, y creo que eso marca la diferencia, independientemente del mensaje central de la película o del puñado de escenas fabulosas. Véase también Benjamin Button, que no mencioné solo para irritarte, realmente creo que tienes más una vena sentimental que yo con respecto a los niños en el cine, especialmente cuando se usan más como símbolos de vulnerabilidad e inocencia que como personajes humanos. Oye, ¿sabes qué película no tiene moppets lindos de ojos abiertos que traen esperanza a un mundo cínico? G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra. Tal vez iré a ver esos extras de Blu-ray. Podría usar un poco de insulina de explosión para compensar la dulzura de Hugo. |
| "I hoped my daughter would be free from difficult and troubling times": Mee Mee's story as a refugee Mom<br/><br/>Hope in Times of Crisis: A Mother's Day Story<br/><br/>By Judith Santiago*<br/><br/>Mee Mee heard that the soldiers were coming. She took hold of her son and frantically joined the rest of the villagers who were running toward the Thai-Burmese border, where the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) was located. Her husband was in another village running in the opposite direction, Mee later learned. After the soldiers' pursuit ended, Mee returned home to her small village in Koechi, Burma.<br/><br/>During 1997-2000, Mee and thousands like her lived under the constant threat of violence from Burmese soldiers. Many people would take temporary refuge in the jungle, and return home to their village after soldiers left the area, just to do it all over again days later. About once a week, Mee and others would be on the move to avoid capture, rape, or death by soldiers.<br/><br/>During one incident, Mee's husband ran ahead of his wife to secure food for his family. Her husband was spotted by soldiers and shot. The bullet shattered a portion of his ribcage, leaving him severely wounded and in distress as he journeyed toward the jungle with his family for safety.<br/><br/>For three months, Mee's husband hid and moved the family with an exasperating wound at his side. He received no medical care, except for Mee's tending.<br/><br/>"I was afraid to return to Burma," Mee said through an interpreter. "I feared dying. I cried and cried every day," she continued.<br/><br/>Mee's husband eventually drew enough strength to walk five days toward a small village in Thailand where they learned the location of a hospital and a refugee camp. When Mee and her husband finally arrived at the hospital, he underwent immediate surgery and later recovered.<br/><br/>Symbol of Hope<br/><br/>Life in the jungle for those fleeing Burmese soldiers was indeed terrifying and difficult. Makeshift bamboo tents with only roof and floor coverings became suitable temporary dwellings. Many women including Mee gave birth to children in the jungle. Mee's then six-year-old son assisted in the delivery of his sister named Eh Ku Hser. Her name means love – cold – sweet. "Cold" in Burmese culture means so as to not pass through the fire of life, as heat represents troubled times.<br/><br/>"I hoped my daughter would be free from difficult and troubling times," said Mee. "I did not want her to go through what I had experienced," she continued.<br/><br/>For Mee, the birth of her daughter in the midst of darkness, torment and fear, was a symbol of hope for a new life to come. Hope in times of crisis, the very premise of the United Methodist Committee on Relief's (UMCOR) newly co-branded UMCOR-Prosperity Candle, is also the essence of that which candles shed light upon.<br/><br/>A New Beginning<br/><br/>With the help of UNHCR, hope for a new life did indeed materialize for Mee and her family when they resettled in West Springfield, Massachusetts. There, Mee met Moo Kho Paw, another woman who emigrated from Burma, and who was working at Prosperity Candle in Florence. The organization helps refugee women who have escaped areas of conflict rebuild their lives through the art of candle making. Moo Kho recommended that Mee join the organization, and Mee gladly accepted.<br/><br/>"I was excited to be out of the house," said Mee, "I was raised to believe that because I was a woman, my role was to remain at home and raise my family," she continued. "While many Burmese women want to do more for themselves, they are often encouraged to remain homemakers."<br/><br/>Today, Mee has plans to go into the candle-making business for herself and support her five children, but she expressed the need to learn English first.<br/><br/>"In the Thai refugee camp, we had education, but it was not so good," said Mee. "When I was a child, I wanted to go to school, but I was told to stay home because I was a woman. Now, I have hopes for my daughters to go to college and become doctors or policewomen," continued Mee.<br/><br/>Mee has struck an even balance in her life that she wishes others would have found—a simple, happy life where work, caring for family members and freedom of choice all have their place.<br/><br/>Support Refugee Women in the US<br/><br/>Share this Mother's Day story with your loved ones. And, when you purchase handmade candles by Mee, Moo Kho, and Naw, another Burmese refugee woman working at Prosperity Candle , know you are helping to support their livelihood as they rebuild their lives and those of their family members in the US. | "Esperaba que mi hija estuviera libre de tiempos difíciles y preocupantes": la historia de Mee Mee como una madre refugiada<br/><br/>Esperanza en tiempos de crisis: la historia del día de la madre<br/><br/>por Judith Santiago<br/><br/>Mee Mee oyó que los soldados venían. Se apoderó de su hijo y se unió frenéticamente al resto de los aldeanos que corrían hacia la frontera entre Tailandia y Birmania, donde se encontraba la Oficina del Alto Comisionado de las Naciones Unidas para los Refugiados (ACNUR). Su marido estaba en otra aldea corriendo en la dirección opuesta, Mee se enteró más tarde.Después de la persecución de los soldados terminó, Mee regresó a casa a su pequeño pueblo en Koechi, Birmania.<br/><br/>Durante 1997-2000, Mee y miles como ella vivieron bajo la constante amenaza de la violencia de los soldados birmanos. Muchas personas se refugiaban temporalmente en la selva y regresaban a su pueblo después de que los soldados abandonaran el área, solo para hacerlo de nuevo días después. Aproximadamente una vez a la semana, Mee y otros estarían en movimiento para evitar la captura, la violación o la muerte por parte de los soldados.<br/><br/>Durante un incidente, el marido de Mee corrió delante de su esposa para conseguir comida para su familia. La bala destrozó una parte de su caja torácica, dejándolo gravemente herido y en peligro mientras viajaba hacia la selva con su familia por seguridad.<br/><br/>Durante tres meses, el esposo de Mee se escondió y trasladó a la familia con una herida exasperante a su lado. No recibió atención médica, excepto por la atención de Mee.<br/><br/>"Tenía miedo de regresar a Birmania", dijo Mee a través de un intérprete. "Temía morir. Lloré y lloré todos los días", continuó.<br/><br/>El esposo de Mee finalmente sacó la fuerza suficiente para caminar cinco días hacia un pequeño pueblo en Tailandia, donde se enteraron de la ubicación de un hospital y un campo de refugiados. Cuando Mee y su esposo finalmente llegaron al hospital, se sometió a una cirugía inmediata y luego se recuperó.<br/><br/>Símbolo de la esperanza<br/><br/>La vida en la selva para aquellos que huían de los soldados birmanos era realmente aterradora y difícil. Las tiendas de bambú improvisadas con solo techo y suelos se convirtieron en viviendas temporales adecuadas. Muchas mujeres, incluida Mee, dieron a luz a niños en la selva. El hijo de seis años de Mee ayudó en la entrega de su hermana llamada Eh Ku Hser. Su nombre significa amor, frío, dulce. "Frío" en la cultura birmana significa no pasar por el fuego de la vida, ya que el calor representa tiempos difíciles.<br/><br/>“Esperaba que mi hija estuviera libre de momentos difíciles y preocupantes”, dijo Mee, “no quería que pasara por lo que yo había experimentado”.<br/><br/>Para mí, el nacimiento de su hija en medio de la oscuridad, el tormento y el miedo, era un símbolo de esperanza para una nueva vida por venir. La esperanza en tiempos de crisis, la premisa misma de la recién co-marcada vela UMCOR-Prosperity del United Methodist Committee on Relief (UMCOR), es también la esencia de aquello sobre lo que las velas arrojan luz.<br/><br/>Un nuevo comienzo<br/><br/>Con la ayuda de ACNUR, la esperanza de una nueva vida se materializó para Mee y su familia cuando se reasentaron en West Springfield, Massachusetts. Allí, Mee conoció a Moo Kho Paw, otra mujer que emigró de Birmania, y que trabajaba en Prosperity Candle en Florencia. La organización ayuda a las mujeres refugiadas que han escapado de áreas de conflicto a reconstruir sus vidas a través del arte de hacer velas. Moo Kho recomendó que Mee se uniera a la organización, y Mee aceptó con gusto.<br/><br/>"Estaba emocionada de estar fuera de la casa", dijo Mee, "me criaron para creer que porque era una mujer, mi papel era permanecer en casa y criar a mi familia", continuó. “Si bien muchas mujeres birmanas quieren hacer más por sí mismas, a menudo se les alienta a seguir siendo amas de casa”.<br/><br/>Hoy en día, Mee tiene planes de entrar en el negocio de fabricación de velas para ella y mantener a sus cinco hijos, pero ella expresó la necesidad de aprender inglés primero.<br/><br/>“En el campo de refugiados de Tailandia, tuvimos educación, pero no fue tan buena”, dijo Mee. “Cuando era niña, quería ir a la escuela, pero me dijeron que me quedara en casa porque era mujer. Ahora, tengo esperanzas de que mis hijas vayan a la universidad y se conviertan en doctoras o policías”, continuó Mee.<br/><br/>Mee ha logrado un equilibrio uniforme en su vida que desearía que otros hubieran encontrado: una vida simple y feliz donde el trabajo, el cuidado de los miembros de la familia y la libertad de elección tengan su lugar.<br/><br/>Apoyar a las mujeres refugiadas en los Estados Unidos<br/><br/>Comparte esta historia del Día de la Madre con tus seres queridos. Y, cuando compras velas hechas a mano por Mee, Moo Kho y Naw, otra refugiada birmana que trabaja en Prosperity Candle, sabes que estás ayudando a mantener su sustento mientras reconstruyen sus vidas y las de sus familiares en los Estados Unidos. |
| The Precedency Essay<br/><br/>1562 words - 7 pages<br/><br/>Affirmative action is a government policy that gives opportunities to minorities, women, and any group who has been the victim of discrimination in the past. Affirmative action is the outcome of the 1960's Civil Rights movement, growing out of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 which outlawed discrimination based on race, ethnicity, or gender. It was the 1978 Supreme Court decision, The Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, which allowed for the use of race-based preferences as a means of fostering diversity, allowing affirmative action to be used in admissions policies. It was created with the intention to provide equal opportunities for members of minority groups in education and ...view middle of the document...<br/><br/>However, according to a 2007 report by the Pew Research Center, support for affirmative action among the American public has actually increased substantiallyin recent years, climbing from 58% in 1995 to 70% in 2007. Supporters of affirmative action make many arguments in support of affirmative action, in the hopes of getting others to see the genuine good that affirmative actin policies bring to our society. Supporters believe that affirmative action is more of a process rather than an admissions policy. Colleges and universities take the extra initiative to reach out to minority groups, encouraging them to apply. Colleges and universities offer additional financial aid and provide on-campus resources to help better the student's college education. Supporters also note the rising number of minority applications to colleges and universities due in part to affirmative action policies.<br/>Statistics have proven that when affirmative action is eliminated, such as when it was at Berkley College and UCLA in 1998, the minority student admissions fell 61 percent and 36 percent respectively, proving that affirmative action plays a major role in a minority students college admissions process. Affirmative action supporters also believe that diversity in higher education provides a better educational atmosphere for all students, personally and intellectually. If affirmative action were to be eliminated, there would be fewer minority students enrolled in colleges, causing diversity to be fairly slim. Affirmative action policies are also necessary in order to compensate for centuries of racial, economic, and social oppression. Individuals with a higher socioeconomic status have more opportunities than those of lower socioeconomic backgrounds. Supporters believe that certain racial or ethnic groups are disadvantaged because they are frequently in lower income households and consequently are not exposed to the same resources as students from higher socioeconomic classes. Advocates support the notion of competition between students based on merit, but argue that affirmative action compensates for economic differences. College graduates, who have benefitted from affirmative action, have also said that they received better jobs, earned more money, and overall live better lives because of the fortunate opportunities they received through affirmative action.<br/>Supporters of affirmative action continuously stress the severe importance of affirmative action, considering its contributions to enhancing both the college experience and society in general. However, opponents of affirmative action believe that the time has come to end affirmative action. Opponents believe affirmative action was created to ensure fair admission practices to bring change to a long period of racial discrimination. They believe the policy is outdated."It's time to pull the plug on race-based decision making," says Ward Connerly, a Sacramento, California businessman and lead organizer of...<br/><br/>Find Another Essay On The Precedency<br/><br/>754 words - 4 pages<br/>of the burden to continue prospering.

La acción afirmativa es el resultado del movimiento de derechos civiles de 1960, que surgió de la Ley de derechos civiles de 1964, que prohibió la discriminación basada en la raza, el origen étnico o el género. Fue la decisión de la Corte Suprema de 1978, The Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, que permitió el uso de preferencias basadas en la raza como un medio para fomentar la diversidad, permitiendo que la acción afirmativa se use en las políticas de admisión. Fue creado con la intención de proporcionar igualdad de oportunidades para los miembros de los grupos minoritarios en la educación y la educación.<br/><br/>Sin embargo, según un informe de 2007 del Pew Research Center, el apoyo a la acción afirmativa entre el público estadounidense ha aumentado sustancialmente en los últimos años, pasando del 58% en 1995 al 70% en 2007. Los partidarios de la acción afirmativa hacen muchos argumentos en apoyo de la acción afirmativa, con la esperanza de lograr que otros vean el bien genuino que las políticas de actina afirmativa traen a nuestra sociedad. Los partidarios creen que la acción afirmativa es más un proceso que una política de admisión. Los colegios y las universidades toman la iniciativa adicional de llegar a los grupos minoritarios, alentándolos a postularse. Las universidades ofrecen ayuda financiera adicional y proporcionan recursos en el campus para ayudar a mejorar la educación universitaria del estudiante. Los partidarios también señalan el creciente número de solicitudes de minorías a colegios y universidades debido en parte a las políticas de acción afirmativa.<br/>Las estadísticas han demostrado que cuando se elimina la acción afirmativa, como cuando estaba en Berkley College y UCLA en 1998, las admisiones de estudiantes minoritarios cayeron un 61 por ciento y un 36 por ciento respectivamente, lo que demuestra que la acción afirmativa juega un papel importante en un proceso de admisión de estudiantes minoritarios. Los partidarios de la acción afirmativa también creen que la diversidad en la educación superior proporciona un mejor ambiente educativo para todos los estudiantes, personal e intelectualmente. Si se eliminara la acción afirmativa, habría menos estudiantes minoritarios matriculados en las universidades, lo que haría que la diversidad fuera bastante escasa. Las políticas de acción afirmativa también son necesarias para compensar siglos de opresión racial, económica y social. Los individuos con un estatus socioeconómico más alto tienen más oportunidades que los de entornos socioeconómicos más bajos. Los partidarios creen que ciertos grupos raciales o étnicos están en desventaja porque con frecuencia están en hogares de bajos ingresos y, en consecuencia, no están expuestos a los mismos recursos que los estudiantes de clases socioeconómicas más altas. Los defensores apoyan la noción de competencia entre estudiantes basada en el mérito, pero argumentan que la acción afirmativa compensa las diferencias económicas. Los graduados universitarios, que se han beneficiado de la acción afirmativa, también han dicho que recibieron mejores trabajos, ganaron más dinero y, en general, viven mejor debido a las afortunadas oportunidades que recibieron a través de la acción afirmativa.<br/>Los partidarios de la acción afirmativa enfatizan continuamente la gran importancia de la acción afirmativa, considerando sus contribuciones para mejorar tanto la experiencia universitaria como la sociedad en general. Sin embargo, quienes se oponen a la acción afirmativa creen que ha llegado el momento de poner fin a la acción afirmativa y creen que la acción afirmativa se creó para garantizar prácticas de admisión justas para lograr un cambio en un largo período de discriminación racial.

| Combinations<br/><br/>Combinations Are defenses against a punch, choreographed responses to different types of attacks. They have many names across the martial arts but (in my experience) every art has a version of them. This makes them different than forms because there are plenty of martial arts that have no forms. What makes there partner exercises so universal? Why practice a specific response when (in reality) timing, type of attack, size of the attacker, and a hundred other factors will make it so you never use that entire choreographed response? And finally, how can we practice for a real defense situation and avoid injury at the same time?<br/><br/>The universality of combinations is impressive, to say the least. Our style of Kenpo karate has a list of 108 combos that can be learned. (Most students only learn 20-30 though) In Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu you spend whole classes practicing arm bars and chokes, learning every subtlety to the move while your partner offers little to no resistance. Every boxer has spent hours in front of the bag and/or mirror throwing the same combination of punches until their body moves by reflex alone. Combinations are universal because we have no better way to introduce movement and then practice the subtle positions required to make them work. Hitting a small pressure point through clothing takes A LOT of practice, catching an arm bar with control requires a carefully placed hip and a sneaky setup, and a great combination is only useful if you can through it from a balanced and protected position. Can you think of a better way to gain these skills?<br/><br/>There is any number of factors that determine how you respond to an attack and whether in a sparring match or in a fight, I have NEVER used a full combination in my defense. Why, then, do we spend hours practicing them? We practice these choreographed responses because the objective is not to pull combination 8 out every time you see a hook punch but to show you one way of blocking it and then a possible way to follow it up. I have never chosen to use combination 3 in a reality situation but the block is one of my go-to moves. Combinations add tools to the toolbox they do not fix the car.<br/><br/>The last question is a question of safety. If we practice for the sake of reality we need to replicate reality. How do we prevent injury while doing so? When it comes down to it, it's about building trust. We start slow and learn to trust that we have control over ourselves. We learn to trust our partners have control as well. In more time we learn to trust our control over our partner and (a little scarier) we learn to trust our partner's control over us. In the end (with a lot of practice) you can move are full speed, tossing your partner, and being thrown without fear of injury.<br/><br/>Combinations are universal for a reason; they are practiced so they can be dissected into their parts, and we stay safe by starting slow and building trust. As with everything else in the martial arts, combinations have many reasons behind their practice and execution. | Combinaciones<br/><br/>Las combinaciones son defensas contra un golpe, respuestas coreografiadas a diferentes tipos de ataques. Tienen muchos nombres en las artes marciales pero (en mi experiencia) cada arte tiene una versión de ellos. Esto los hace diferentes a las formas porque hay muchas artes marciales que no tienen formas. ¿Qué hace que los ejercicios de pareja sean tan universales? ¿Por qué practicar una respuesta específica cuando (en realidad) el tiempo, el tipo de ataque, el tamaño del atacante y otros cien factores harán que nunca uses toda esa respuesta coreografiada? Y finalmente, ¿cómo podemos practicar para una situación de defensa real y evitar lesiones al mismo tiempo?<br/><br/>La universalidad de las combinaciones es impresionante, por decir lo menos. Nuestro estilo de karate Kenpo tiene una lista de 108 combos que se pueden aprender. (Sin embargo, la mayoría de los estudiantes solo aprenden de 20 a 30) En el Jiu-Jitsu brasileño pasas clases completas practicando barras de brazo y estrangulamientos, aprendiendo cada sutileza del movimiento mientras tu pareja ofrece poca o ninguna resistencia. Cada boxeador ha pasado horas frente a la bolsa y / o espejo lanzando la misma combinación de golpes hasta que su cuerpo se mueve por reflejo solo. Las combinaciones son universales porque no tenemos una mejor manera de introducir el movimiento y luego practicar las posiciones sutiles requeridas para que funcionen. Golpear un pequeño punto de presión a través de la ropa requiere MUCHA práctica, atrapar una barra de brazo con control requiere una cadera cuidadosamente colocada y una configuración furtiva, y una gran combinación solo es útil si puede hacerlo desde una posición equilibrada y protegida. ¿Se te ocurre una mejor manera de adquirir estas habilidades?<br/><br/>Hay una serie de factores que determinan cómo respondes a un ataque y si en un combate de sparring o en una pelea, NUNCA he usado una combinación completa en mi defensa. ¿Por qué, entonces, pasamos horas practicándolos? Practicamos estas respuestas coreografiadas porque el objetivo no es sacar la combinación 8 cada vez que ves un golpe de gancho, sino mostrarte una forma de bloquearlo y luego una posible forma de seguirlo. Nunca he elegido usar la combinación 3 en una situación de realidad, pero el bloque es uno de mis movimientos. Las combinaciones agregan herramientas a la caja de herramientas que no arreglan el automóvil.<br/><br/>La última pregunta es una cuestión de seguridad. Si practicamos por el bien de la realidad, necesitamos replicar la realidad. ¿Cómo evitamos lesiones mientras lo hacemos? Cuando se trata de eso, se trata de generar confianza. Comenzamos despacio y aprendemos a confiar en que tenemos control sobre nosotros mismos. Aprendemos a confiar en que nuestros socios también tienen control. En más tiempo aprendemos a confiar en nuestro control sobre nuestro socio y (un poco más aterrador) aprendemos a confiar en el control de nuestro socio sobre nosotros. Al final (con mucha práctica) puedes moverte a toda velocidad, lanzar a tu pareja y ser lanzado sin miedo a las lesiones.<br/><br/>Las combinaciones son universales por una razón; se practican para que puedan ser diseccionadas en sus partes, y nos mantenemos seguros comenzando lentamente y construyendo confianza. Al igual que con todo lo demás en las artes marciales, las combinaciones tienen muchas razones detrás de su práctica y ejecución. |
