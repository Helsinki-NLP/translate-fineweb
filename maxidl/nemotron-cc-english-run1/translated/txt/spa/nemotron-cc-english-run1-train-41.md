| Bacopa<br/><br/>19 Nov 2015<br/>Posted by Doxiderol<br/><br/>Bacopa is a perennial plant that thrives in marshy subtropical and tropical regions around the globe. The highly regarded herb is a key ingredient in Doxiderol, a nutritional supplement that enhances cognitive function. Bacopa was chosen for its ability to protect the brain and increase acetylcholine, a biochemical messenger that enables the nervous system to relay information.<br/><br/>Ayurvedic practitioners first described the therapeutic properties of bacopa in 300 BC. The physicians recorded bacopa's abilities to enhance intelligence and memory. Nearly 2,500 years later, a growing body of modern research confirms the cognitive benefits of bacopa recorded in the Ayurvedic text.<br/><br/>In 1987, researchers in India evaluated the effects of bacopa on the intellectual function of school-aged children. During the four-week study, they administered bacopa to 40 children who were 6 to 8 years old. The scientists determined that bacopa increased perception and memory. The children were able to solve maze exercises quicker and more accurately after receiving bacopa. Many parents in India routinely use bacopa to enhance their children's intellectual development.<br/><br/>A 12-week study published in the August 2001 issue of Psychopharmacology investigated the effects of bacopa on cognitive function. Scientists randomly assigned the healthy volunteers, aged 18 to 65, to receive bacopa or an inactive substance. They also used a double-blind configuration for the study to conceal the identities of the products. Researchers use this design to ensure that the test results are valid because it eliminates bias by the researchers and participants. The bacopa group experienced a significant improvement in the speed at which they were able to process visual information. The participants also learned faster and stored new memories more efficiently.<br/><br/>In 2007, a Texas A&M College of Medicine laboratory study revealed one of the mechanisms responsible for bacopa's ability to promote brain health. According to the scientists, bacopa uses polyphenols to prevent oxidative stress and the damage that it causes to healthy brain cells. Bacopa also reduces harmful deposits of a substance known as beta-amyloid, which is the primary component of the plaque in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease.<br/><br/>A double-blind study published in the July 2008 issue of the Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine evaluated the effect of bacopa on elderly patients. The study confirmed that bacopa increased cognitive performance while reducing stress. According to the authors, the benefits achieved in this study confirmed the results of earlier research.<br/><br/>A 90-day study published in the December 2008 issue of Phytotherapy Research confirms the cognitive benefits that were previously demonstrated in other bacopa studies. Bacopa significantly improved the ability of the participants to temporarily store and use information required for completing a complex task. The double-blind study also demonstrated that bacopa reduced the time required to process visual information.<br/><br/>In addition to enhancing nerve signal transmission, the scientists theorize that bacopa increases cognitive function by reducing anxiety. Numerous studies indicate that anxiety interferes with the ability to perform tasks that require higher-level cognitive functions, such as learning and memorization. Stress disrupts biochemical messengers and healthy nerve signal transmission. Bacopa alleviates stress and restores a sense of calm by increasing acetylcholine levels, which reduces your heart rate and enables you to take deeper breaths.<br/><br/>Doxiderol is a great way to obtain the benefits of bacopa. This holistic supplement also contains other natural ingredients that promote brain health and support your ability to focus and concentrate on complex task as well as memorize information. | Bacopa<br/><br/>19 Nov 2015<br/>Publicado por Doxidrol<br/><br/>Bacopa es una planta perenne que prospera en las regiones subtropicales y tropicales pantanosas de todo el mundo.

Numerosos estudios indican que la ansiedad interfiere con la capacidad de realizar tareas que requieren funciones cognitivas de alto nivel, como el aprendizaje y la memorización.El estrés interrumpe los mensajeros bioquímicos y la transmisión de señales nerviosas saludables. Bacopa alivia el estrés y restaura una sensación de calma al aumentar los niveles de acetilcolina, lo que reduce su ritmo cardíaco y le permite respirar más profundamente.<br/><br/>Doxidrol es una gran manera de obtener los beneficios de la bacopa.

She can also sense demonic auras as well as evil auras. When she was born and growing, however, her powers were sealed and she was much less powerful. Since the defeat of the one sealing her powers, Kagome has reached her full potential.<br/><br/>PURIFICATION By making a physical connection, Kagome has the ability to purify both poison and darkness from a subject (living and inanimate). To do so, she projects her spiritual powers through her hand.<br/><br/>SPIRITUAL BARRIERS With her full potential, Kagome has the ability to create a barrier around herself and expand it around others. It is a dome-shaped barrier that can destroy weak demons that make contact with the barrier.<br/><br/>IMPROVED EYESIGHT<br/>Kagome has the ability to see things that are often invisible to the human eye: ghosts, spirits, divine and evil auras.<br/><br/>ABILITIES WITH WEAPONS<br/>Kagome has the ability to use a bow and arrow. She has been self trained, and after years of practice, her arrow rarely misses its mark. Alongside this, Kagome has the ability to infuse her arrows with powers. She can infuse an arrows with her spiritual powers which allows them to penetrate demonic forces, destroy spells, and purify objects. She can infuse her bow with her powers and deflect enemy attacks. She has the ability to infuse her arrows with purifying energy to purify poison as well as powerful, long distant demonic attacks. And, finally, she has the ability to bypass others with her arrow: If her target happens to be behind a barrier or a hostage, the arrow can teleport and hit only her target<br/><br/>The rest of her abilities have become rather unimportant as they are related to time travel (through the Bone Eater's Well), the Shikon Jewel, or her previous incarnation.<br/><br/>the canon<br/><br/>Kagome has been pulled a few days after her high school graduation, however, before the Bone Eater's Well has opened again to allow her to return to the past permanently.<br/><br/>freestyle<br/><br/>memories<br/><br/>かごめ<br/><br/>The sound of her name was a soft whisper in the back of her mind, like a call muffled by the wind. It was the sound of a distant memory, a voice that she had started to forget but desperately clung to all the same. It was her mother's voice, twisted in the sorrow of her lost daughter. Afterall, Kagome banished without a trace. She vividly remembered those moments, the way the day had begun, what she had for breakfast and the last thing she had said to her mother. It was haunting, those memories, because it was like any other time she had slipped between worlds. She had woken, listless, because she had no purpose outside of school. She could find a job, and was scheduled for an interview that day. Her heart hadn't been in it, but it was what she needed to do.<br/><br/>She remembered the feeling of dread, sucking it up and giving herself a pep talk that she could do this. That she could progress in the life that she was meant to now that things had been settled in the past. Of course, she had the lingering feeling that she no longer belonged in her own time or her own life. Not with everything that she had left behind.<br/><br/>Kagome remembered the feeling of the wood beneath her fingers, the way her hand had curled into the handle to slide the door open. She remembered that she paused, turning to her mother with a bright and vibrant smile as she shook herself from her stupor. "I'm taking off." She remembered how strong her voice sounded, the smile on her mother's lips as her eyes shone with pride. Her mother bade her farewell, which didn't seem any different than before but somehow the weight of the words settled in heavier on Kagome's shoulders the more she reflected.<br/><br/>Briefly, the thoughts flickered forward, wondering if her mother worried over her, missed her like she did. Kagome could openly admit that her mother's strength, her support for the fact that her daughter slipped through time so frequently. There were times when she thought herself weak for not having the woman to lean on.<br/><br/>However, she remembered that she did muster up a meager amount of strength.She could remember the shift in the air, the temperature notably different than what she had expected, blinking at the sudden and unfamiliar surroundings. It was not her family's shrine. And when she turned to go back, to slip through the door she had come through, she was met with unfamiliar and cold metal beneath her fingertips and an interior that was not the entrance of her house. A man stood before her, behind a counter, who stared at her with eyes as wide as her own.<br/><br/>She didn't panic, at least. Being torn through time and placed in impossible situations at least built your willpower as far as strange happenings went. Because it wasn't every day that someone found themselves dragged into the past by a demon, intent on ripping a powerful jewel from their body that they didn't even know was there. And then there was the fact that she had shattered said powerful jewel into who knows how many pieces and was tasked on finding them. Such things were not normal, and she had needed to square up and roll with it once she realized that was her reality. It had seemed so simple, just gather the shards and fix the jewel.<br/><br/>But it hadn't been easy, there were many demons after the shards and the jewel itself. And one particularly powerful demon with a wish that he was determined to see fulfilled. To this day, she had never learned his wish but knew it had never been granted even once he had the blasted thing completed. He had ruined so many lives for the sake of nothing. Ruined so many lives for such a futile task. Naraku had been the most difficult foe, and the one who had been the center of everything that had gone wrong in all of her friend's lives.<br/><br/>But, it was that unpredicability, that necessity to roll with what was happening and the willpower that she had gained from her adventure that she remembered drawing upon to come up with a story that fit in the moment that didn't seem too whimsical or far fetched. She needed to be believed, she needed to survive.<br/><br/>Afterall, she faced worse than a man in a camera store. She had lied through her teeth to save her life before.<br/><br/>"I was looking for a job." In the end, it wasn't a complete lie. After all, she had set out of her house with the intent of attending a job interview. Her state of dress would at least attest to that much. It was one of the easier fibs she had ever told.<br/><br/>And, for some reason, that crazy man hired her.<br/><br/>かごめ<br/><br/>Kagomed rolled over in her bed as she pushed back the distant memories, refusing to acknowledge that she was really awake. She clawed at the last glimpses of sleep, begging it to return and to take her back into its embrace. She closed her eyes, willing sleep to come and was only met with memories. The echoes of a song sang in the distance of her memories, a song that had often tormented her, given the same name as her. The voice that sang was no longer reminiscent of her mother, but the voices of children who she had often played with growing up. They called back the memories, even though it had been years since she started this live, even though she was happy in this life, the call of these memories was too loud.<br/><br/>Suddenly, she was falling back into them and sleep evaded her again. She was watching herself in her family's embrace while Inuyasha was pulled back into the well, looking as startled as she had felt. The memories of that moment, those feelings, were still so strong. The feeling of heartbreak and sorrow welled up again though it had been so long since she had felt like she had been ripped away from everything that mattered to her.<br/><br/>Of course her family mattered, and she was happy to be in their arms again. She could never fully, truly describe how she had felt in those days. She still couldn't explain the way she felt split in two, with warring desires to be in both her past and present. She remembered the futile attempts to jump through the well, fingers clawing at the ground in a desperate plea to let her return. The first month home, she didn't sleep so much as she cried.<br/><br/>Elysion had garnished a similar reaction, though it was not so fierce because she didn't know exactly where she had slipped through nor did she know where she could worm her way back. Her explorations were subtle between working her job and trying to settle herself into this life. She had no intentions of staying, no intentions of lingering longer than she needed. And while she didn't try as fiercely as she had when she tried to return to the past, her passion was tenfold because she had no ties to this world. Because she was truly alone… With no hope of anyone to reach her.<br/><br/>In her irrational moments, she thought the Jewel had pulled her back and found a new hell for her to reside in. A new hell that would force her to make a wish, but she remembered very clearly that she had wished it gone forever. That didn't stop her dreams, the times when she woke up in the night sobbing. And those memories of her past were the hardest to deal with, the hardest to forget. Her heart began to race in a panic as she turned in her bed again, her breath became a struggle as she fought against a panic attack induced by her wandering mind this late into the night.<br/><br/>She hated feeling so weak, so afraid.<br/><br/>籠の中の鳥は<br/><br/>Kagome finally pulled herself from bed, her room lit with a pale light that was enough to guide her to the bathroom. She stood before the mirror, the sink running while she stared at her reflection. Raven colored hair covered her face and she felt as bad as she looked. Her first morning in Elysion was similar to this, only she was in worse shape.<br/><br/>She had found a place to sleep, managing to work out a deal with the owner of the building to allow her to stay a small period of time without paying. Perhaps it had been Miroku's influence that allowed her to strike such deals, as the monk was known for his way in charming (or scamming) people into giving them more than enough for the work they had done. The monk had always been that way, since they had first met. He would claim the dwelling of a lord to be haunted when it was not or, claim that they were subject to an attack when they would not be. He would sell his wards and charms for such high prices. It worked practically every time and she wondered why people had been so willing to trust him.<br/><br/>Perhaps it was his smile, or the fact that he was a monk that the people of the past were so willing to crumble. He never preyed on the weak, at least. He always did what was right and he was a symbol of strength to her at times when he would push through everything in order to do what was right. He pushed through the fact that he was dying, that he was cursed, and tried to do something about it rather than wallowing in his fate. He had pushed himself to the limit in the time leading up to their final fight. And she had been glad that they had defeated Naraku before he could become subject to the same fate as his father, and his father before him.<br/><br/>As far as her own charms went, however, she was more fair than her friend and made the deal reasonable. She doubted that anyone in this world would pay a hefty price for an exorcism or banishing demons. They were too technologically advanced for that. But she was clever enough, and smart enough, to make a good deal.<br/><br/>But now, Kagome was in a better place though the look on her face looked the same. Haunted, tired, drained...<br/><br/>A quick glance at a clock on the wall told her that she could try to sleep longer. But she opted out of that, not wanting to face the flashbacks again. She took a shower instead, using the cold water to chase away her demons, to fill her lungs with a sharp intake of breath and force herself awake.<br/><br/>いついつ出やる<br/><br/>It didn't work.<br/><br/>Not in the way she was wanting. The cold water certainly forced the air into her lungs, forced her mind to wake and muscles to seize. A bitter laugh was pulled from her lips as she tilted her head back and found herself remembering more. Today, she wasn't going to escape them so easily. She wasn't going to recover so simply, to recover just because she willed it.<br/><br/>Sometimes, there's no avoiding the thoughts you wanted to. Even when you were certain that you were past them.<br/><br/>Sango would have been a great help in this situation. The demon slayer was her best friend, she would even go as far as to call her the sister that she never had. An older sister who was wise, always had her side when trouble arose. Particularly boy trouble, when such things were rather trivial but it was fun to have a crush and for her friend to be mad on her behalf when Inuyasha made her sad. After all, it had been often that the half-demon would run to his dead lover's side and break her heart more than once.<br/><br/>But, Sango also inspired her in other ways. After all the woman had faced, she had always been so strong, so sure... Even in the times that she had doubted herself, she always pulled through. She admired that she had the ability to survive after losing her whole family -- the reminder of this often pushed Kagome to survive, because she lost everyone to this world -- and then having her brother become a pawn of Naraku. It wasn't easy, couldn't have been something to that just anyone could face and still go forward with. She still smiled, even with that pain and those reminders... She was often so bright, even in the darker times.<br/><br/>And right now, she wanted to lean into the older woman's side, to take comfort in the fact that she was there and she was supportive. She felt that Sango would somehow pull through this, and offer some words of strength and understanding. It was times like these that made these spells worse, the constant reminder that she was without her family.<br/><br/>"I don't want to be alone." She cried aloud in her solitude, the sound of the shower drowning out the plea.<br/><br/>She wasn't afraid to admit it.<br/><br/>夜明けの晩に<br/><br/>Another hour had slipped by before she had realized it. Her skin was cold from the water and it felt like ice ran through her veins. She hadn't realized she had begun to shiver until her hand reached to turn off the water and end her shower. Kagome didn't seek her own gaze in the mirror again, instead, she wrapped herself in towels and trudged out of the bathroom, up the stairs and into her kitchen. She started on making a light breakfast, idly reading through her notes for the day as the food cooked.<br/><br/>Her career was really taking off these last years. Her photos were featured in many galleries, her name started to frequent many lips for those who were interested in photography.<br/><br/>The job she had asked for on a whim had sparked it all. She had been far more lucky than she had expected to be in this world. Never lucky enough to slip back through the cracks into her own world, but lucky enough to do well. As she turned back to the stove, she remembered the time she had finally given up on returning home. It was about two years into her life here, as she had started to venture into photography as more than just a hobby but something she could make a name for herself with.<br/><br/>That day had been particularly pleasant, the sun was high in the sky and she had found herself taking some photos of the natural scenery. A little boy had hidden in one of the plants, and she had caught a picture of the moment his face had settled into a cheerful, mischievous grin the moment before he had jumped out to startle his prey. It reminded her of Shippou, the little kitsune she had, essentially, adopted. He, too, had been torn from his family when they had first met. His father killed and he was determined to avenge him. While young, he did seem so mature in their first encounters.<br/><br/>Maybe it had been the influence of Inuyasha that allowed the kit to act like a kid again, to be young and whimsical at times while others he was more mature. He offered comfort to her in his own way, and she tried to care for him as she would her own though she had been so young then as well. However, her youth did not stop her from understanding how to tend to him or care for him like her child. Her heart swelled when he smiled, when he had been so happy for his gift of crayons and took the time to make art. She was so proud of each drawing that he had finished that she knew that this was how a mother would feel in such a situation.<br/><br/>The pain that had ripped through her was too much, too sudden. She missed him and wanted to see how much he had grown since she had been gone. She had missed so much...<br/><br/>To spare herself any further pain, any false hopes… She gave up. And focused on bettering herself.<br/><br/>鶴と亀が<br/><br/>Breakfast tasted bland, boring, and inspired. Only after she had finished did she realized she had forgotten to any sort of spices or flavor to the food. It was too late now to remember that much, as her mind was too busy remembering other details of her life that clearly had become more important than her food.<br/><br/>"Sit!"<br/><br/>Of course, nothing happened when she had angrily yelled at one particularly frustrating client that reminded her of the half-demon. He was being particularly stubborn and rude, wanting a photo taken his way rather than letting it work out naturally. You could try to force wild animals to behave how you wanted. But, rarely did anyone succeed with force. Inuyasha wasn't as bad, however. Inuyasha had learned before she had been forced away from him. He had become gentler, more understanding, more mature though there were times he was still childish and cocky.<br/><br/>She remember how red her cheeks had burned, but how she stood her ground and fired him. She told him she refused to work for anyone or with anyone who wanted to twist something beyond it's nature, beyond it's own desires.<br/><br/>She should have compared the man to Naraku rather than Inuyasha. Though her client did not have such extreme intentions. At least the feeling afterwards was a pleasant memory. The freedom of knowing that she had come so far that she could refuse work that she didn't want to do, to be her own person that was independent of others. She could say that she made it at that point. Even though she heard rumors days later with words meant to slander her.<br/><br/>She defended herself righteously, like she did towards the end of her journey. After all, she was the only one who could protect herself in this world.<br/><br/>滑った<br/><br/>Morning light began to creep into her home, reminding her again of the passage of time. Again, she considered the list of things she had to do and debated on where to start. Or, if she should even start at all. With how the day began, she didn't know if she could consider that a great idea. It was doubtful that she would be successful with how lost in herself she was becoming.<br/><br/>She didn't want to mess up her latest work. Because she had done that on a few occasions before. It wasn't pleasant to try and recover from a complete disaster.<br/><br/>Kagome remembered the feeling of her expensive, brand new, camera slipping from her hands. She wasn't prepared to support it, because she had just removed it from her bag. Part of her screamed on the inside. A dramatic, over-the-top, full on scream that she frequently did when she was much, much younger. When she was struggling to make it through middle school while hopping between times. The other part of her had remained frozen in place while her lense completely shattered and the rest of the camera had broken along with it.<br/><br/>Seeing Inuyasha's brother, a full demon, standing before her was the last thing she expected when she had made her way out for her photos. He stood as proud as ever, as tall as ever, as imposing as she remembered. He didn't look fazed at all to be in an entirely different world, though she was never the best at reading his mind. His name on her lips was so potent, that she could remember the tiniest feelings as she did. Her lips were chapped, her mouth felt dry, and the bubbling feeling of anxiety in her stomach made her feel sick.<br/><br/>She didn't want her hopes to be up.<br/><br/>But, she wanted him to be there, even if they were not friends. They were allies, if anything, since they had fought side by side. And something was better than absolutely nothing.<br/><br/>And Kagome had the sense enough not to throw herself at him, to wrap her arms around him in relief that knowing she was not alone. Her camera no longer mattered when she approached him. She remembered that nothing else mattered for days as she spent time with him, not speaking of their world but speaking (or, she was speaking and he simply acknowledged that fact).<br/><br/>When, exactly, she fell for him though… Kagome couldn't recall. It was a subtle thing, just like he was. But she knew the feeling was there. And he let her know that she was not alone in the fact that she had fallen, that feelings had somehow blossomed.<br/><br/>後ろの正面<br/><br/>A feeling of weightlessness overtook her and suddenly her eyes opened while her mind desperately clawed for the last thing she was doing. She didn't recall when she had fallen asleep on her couch, but she knew the last place she had been was on the far too comfortable cushions. She didn't struggle, however, or fight the weightlessness as she was in familiar arms. Her head tilted against Sesshoumaru's chest, taking comfort in the fact that he was here and she wasn't alone.<br/><br/>"Welcome back." His response was a soft hum in acknowledgement. He didn't need to speak much for her to understand his intent, or the rest of what he had to say.<br/><br/>He carried her back to her bed, settled her into it with ease. Her eyes met his and she smiled easily because no more memories drifted back, no more recollections teased at her. No, whenever he was near, she never fell back into those thoughts. He had helped, and the years had helped. Today was just… One of those days.<br/><br/>"Sleep." He commanded with ease, her eyes rolled at him but she did not fight because she was tired. Her hand clung tightly to him, while she felt his opposite hand press to her forehead in assessment of her wellbeing.<br/><br/>"I'm okay," she said, her words firm with her promise.<br/><br/>She was okay. She was alive. And she was happy.<br/><br/>だあれ<br/><br/>shipper<br/><br/>summary<br/><br/>Kagome, at one point in her life, was a rather regular teenage girl until she was attacked by a demon inside her family's well house. The demon dragged her down into the well, which magically transported her about 500 years into the past. There, she learned that a sacred jewel was encased inside her body as she was the reincarnation of a priestess that had died 50 years prior to the time she was dragged into. The jewel was ripped from her body and the demon that dragged her through time was defeated by the half-demon that she freed who was pinned to the tree. Kagome befriended the half-demon, Inuyasha, in time and traveled with him to restore the jewel that she, herself, shattered. Though it was not so straightforward and easy to do as many demons and humans sought the jewel for their own purposes. She befriended a young kitsune demon, a monk, and a demon slayer who all traveled with her to restore the jewel.<br/><br/>Her group, however, was not the one to complete the jewel. Instead, an evil half-demon who manipulated the majority of the major events in most of her companion's lives. When he finally collected all the pieces of the jewel and made his wish on the tainted object, Kagome was drawn into the jewel itself with the intent of her making a selfish wish to keep her trapped inside forever, keeping the jewel alive. It was the stubbornness of Inuyasha that managed to save her from the darkness. In the end, she returned to her natural time, finished high school as was expect from a girl of her timeline. Though days later, Kagome ended up in Elysion. She has been in this world for five years, and has long since given up on returning home. She's settled happily into her new life.<br/><br/>platonic<br/><br/>It's rather easy for Kagome to make new friends, she hasn't changed much from her youth. She is a cheerful young woman who is empathetic and welcoming to most of all in her life. In her youth, she befriended demons when most would fear them. Even demons that used to eat humans, she has befriended and she changed their ways (she'd like to think). This being said, it's really easy to become her friend as long as someone is able to shown that they are willing to be redeemed, or show that they are not completely evil. She feels greatly for everyone she meets, so it's hard for her not to be drawn to others in a desire to be friends.<br/><br/>antagonistic<br/><br/>The only way to earn Kagome's wrath is to be so deplorable, so evil, and so far beyond redemption that she can't see any good in you. And she can see the good in pretty much everyone and everything. Honestly, with whom she has faced? A half-demon that pitted two lovers against each other, that cursed the entire male line of one of her friends, and then had her best friend's brother kill their family… Yeah, I don't see her hating anyone without them really, really working for it. Feel free to give it a shot, though.<br/><br/>romantic<br/><br/>When in love, Kagome is a strong support, always staying there even when things may be rough. However, Kagome is not looking for love, wasn't looking for love when she arrived so any past relationships don't exist. This isn't to say that someone hasn't fallen in love with her. She can definitely be the subject of someone's unrequited love, she'll probably be oblivious about it, though. Finally, Kagome is currently engaged to Sesshoumaru, surprisingly. I'm totally open to potential AU things, though. <3<br/><br/>fandom hell<br/><br/>age ancient<br/><br/>species space queen<br/><br/>occupation dying<br/><br/>prefers she/her<br/><br/>awards<br/><br/>pro<br/>she/her est 62woo i suck at plot replies. but ok anyway!!! neptune is very friendly and has that 'cool' persona, he's really fun to be around, and he's SUPER good to work with. like he's super patient and he'll do anything she asks of him--he's really easy to work with, definitely in comparison to other models. so i love the idea of them being all work oriented friends at first and then turning into something more. neptune definitely tries to surround himself with people, because he loves having friends, and kagome is pretty much his type too? like she's sweet and she's a strong woman, and he is actually better friends with women than he is with men, idk why, he just loves being surrounded by female friends who knows. i love my guys being super good friends and protecting their girl friends honestly. but oh M A N i love pseduo-family type relationships and neptune is an only child, so he hasn't had any like, familial relationships like that. so her looking out for him all big sister like would make him be like ????? cause he's confused but also he actually really likes that LOL! they're both good kids, i think they'd be really fun ^^<br/><br/>fandom fire emblem: fates<br/><br/>age ninteen<br/><br/>species Part human / part dragon<br/><br/>occupation representative guardian<br/><br/>prefers she/her<br/><br/>awards<br/><br/>yonder<br/>she/her aest 20 posts<br/><br/>I haven't seen Inuyasha at all but... from what I've read Kagome seems to be one of those people who might be able to help Corrin out with her emotional state.

Frankly she hasn't worked through everything yet since she was essentially at the head of a full-scale war.

You know, she's also a singer/performer at a local theater so I can imagine Kagome going there to scope things out and then catching Elsa backstage or something--and then the friendship could blossom from there!

También puede sentir auras demoníacas, así como auras malvadas. Cuando nació y creció, sin embargo, sus poderes fueron sellados y ella era mucho menos poderosa. Desde la derrota de la que sella sus poderes, Kagome ha alcanzado su máximo potencial.<br/><br/>Al hacer una conexión física, Kagome tiene la capacidad de purificar tanto el veneno como la oscuridad de un sujeto (vivo e inanimado). Para hacerlo, proyecta sus poderes espirituales a través de su mano.<br/><br/>Con todo su potencial, Kagome tiene la capacidad de crear una barrera alrededor de sí misma y expandirla alrededor de los demás. Es una barrera en forma de cúpula que puede destruir demonios débiles que hacen contacto con la barrera.<br/><br/>MEJORA DE LOS OJOS<br/>Kagome tiene la capacidad de ver cosas que a menudo son invisibles para el ojo humano: fantasmas, espíritus, auras divinas y malvadas.<br/><br/>HABILIDADES CON ARMAS<br/>Kagome tiene la habilidad de usar un arco y una flecha. Ella ha sido autoentrenada, y después de años de práctica, su flecha rara vez pierde su marca. Además de esto, Kagome tiene la capacidad de infundir sus flechas con poderes. Ella puede infundir una flecha con sus poderes espirituales que les permite penetrar las fuerzas demoníacas, destruir hechizos y purificar objetos.Ella puede infundir su arco con sus poderes y desviar los ataques enemigos. Ella tiene la capacidad de infundir sus flechas con energía purificadora para purificar el veneno, así como ataques demoníacos poderosos y distantes. Y, finalmente, tiene la capacidad de evitar a los demás con su flecha: si su objetivo está detrás de una barrera o un rehén, la flecha puede teletransportarse y golpear solo a su objetivo.<br/><br/>El resto de sus habilidades se han vuelto poco importantes, ya que están relacionadas con el viaje en el tiempo (a través del Pozo del Comehuesos), la Joya de Shikon o su encarnación anterior.<br/><br/>El canon<br/><br/>Kagome ha sido retirada unos días después de su graduación de la escuela secundaria, sin embargo, antes de que el Pozo del Comehuesos se haya abierto de nuevo para permitirle regresar al pasado de forma permanente.<br/><br/>freestyle<br/><br/>memorias<br/><br/>?<br/><br/>El sonido de su nombre era un suave susurro en el fondo de su mente, como una llamada amortiguada por el viento; era el sonido de un recuerdo lejano, una voz que había empezado a olvidar, pero que desesperadamente se aferraba a todo lo mismo. Era la voz de su madre, retorcida por el dolor de su hija perdida. Después de todo, Kagome desterró sin dejar rastro. Recordó vívidamente esos momentos, la forma en que había comenzado el día, lo que había desayunado y lo último que le había dicho a su madre. Era inquietante, esos recuerdos, porque era como cualquier otra vez que se había deslizado entre los mundos. Se había despertado, apático, porque no tenía ningún propósito fuera de la escuela. Podía encontrar un trabajo, y estaba programado para una entrevista ese día. Su corazón no había estado en ella, pero era lo que tenía que hacer.<br/><br/>Recordó la sensación de temor, absorbiéndola y dándose una charla de que podía hacer esto. Que podía progresar en la vida que estaba destinada a ahora que las cosas se habían resuelto en el pasado. Por supuesto, tenía la sensación persistente de que ya no pertenecía a su propio tiempo ni a su propia vida, no con todo lo que había dejado atrás.<br/><br/>Kagome recordó la sensación de la madera debajo de sus dedos, la forma en que su mano se había acurrucado en la manija para deslizar la puerta abierta. Recordó que se detuvo, volviéndose hacia su madre con una sonrisa brillante y vibrante mientras se sacudía de su estupor. Recordó lo fuerte que sonaba su voz, la sonrisa en los labios de su madre mientras sus ojos brillaban de orgullo. Su madre se despidió, lo que no parecía diferente de antes, pero de alguna manera el peso de las palabras se asentó más pesado en los hombros de Kagome cuanto más reflexionaba.<br/><br/>Brevemente, los pensamientos parpadearon hacia adelante, preguntándose si su madre se preocupaba por ella, la extrañaba como ella lo hizo. Kagome podía admitir abiertamente que la fuerza de su madre, su apoyo al hecho de que su hija se deslizaba a través del tiempo con tanta frecuencia. Hubo momentos en que se consideraba débil por no tener a la mujer en quien apoyarse.<br/><br/>Sin embargo, recordó que había reunido una escasa cantidad de fuerza y que podía recordar el cambio en el aire, la temperatura notablemente diferente de lo que había esperado, parpadeando ante el entorno repentino y desconocido. No era el santuario de su familia, y cuando se volvió para volver, para pasar por la puerta que había atravesado, se encontró con un metal frío y desconocido debajo de las yemas de los dedos y un interior que no era la entrada de su casa. Un hombre estaba de pie ante ella, detrás de un mostrador, que la miraba con los ojos tan abiertos como los suyos.<br/><br/>Ella no entró en pánico, al menos, al ser desgarrada a través del tiempo y colocada en situaciones imposibles, al menos construyó su fuerza de voluntad en lo que respecta a extraños sucesos. Porque no todos los días alguien se veía arrastrado al pasado por un demonio, con la intención de arrancar una poderosa joya de su cuerpo que ni siquiera sabían que estaba allí. Y luego estaba el hecho de que se había hecho añicos la poderosa joya en quién sabe cuántas piezas y tenía la tarea de encontrarlas. Tales cosas no eran normales, y había tenido que cuadrar y rodar con ella una vez que se dio cuenta de que esa era su realidad. Parecía tan simple, simplemente recoja los fragmentos y arregle la joya.<br/><br/>Pero no había sido fácil, había muchos demonios después de los fragmentos y la joya en sí, y un demonio particularmente poderoso con un deseo que estaba decidido a ver cumplido. Hasta el día de hoy, ella nunca había aprendido su deseo, pero sabía que nunca se había concedido ni siquiera una vez que había completado la cosa arruinada. Había arruinado tantas vidas por el bien de la nada. Arruinó tantas vidas por una tarea tan inútil. Naraku había sido el enemigo más difícil, y el que había sido el centro de todo lo que había salido mal en todas las vidas de su amiga.<br/><br/>Pero, era esa impredicabilidad, esa necesidad de seguir adelante con lo que estaba sucediendo y la fuerza de voluntad que había ganado de su aventura que recordaba haber dibujado para llegar a una historia que encajara en el momento que no parecía demasiado caprichosa o descabellada. Necesitaba que la creyeran, necesitaba sobrevivir.<br/><br/>Después de todo, se enfrentaba a algo peor que un hombre en una tienda de cámaras y había mentido entre dientes para salvar su vida.<br/><br/>"Estaba buscando un trabajo." Al final, no era una mentira completa. Después de todo, ella había salido de su casa con la intención de asistir a una entrevista de trabajo. Su estado de vestimenta al menos lo atestiguaría. Fue una de las mentiras más fáciles que había contado.<br/><br/>Y, por alguna razón, ese loco la contrató.<br/><br/>?<br/><br/>Kagomed se revolcó en su cama mientras hacía retroceder los recuerdos distantes, negándose a reconocer que estaba realmente despierta, arañando los últimos destellos de sueño, rogándole que regresara y la llevara de vuelta a su abrazo. Cerró los ojos, dispuesta a dormir y solo se encontró con recuerdos. Los ecos de una canción cantaban en la distancia de sus recuerdos, una canción que a menudo la había atormentado, con el mismo nombre que ella. La voz que cantaba ya no era una reminiscencia de su madre, sino las voces de los niños con los que había jugado a menudo al crecer. Recordaron los recuerdos, a pesar de que habían pasado años desde que comenzó esta vida, a pesar de que era feliz en esta vida, la llamada de estos recuerdos era demasiado fuerte.<br/><br/>De repente, ella estaba cayendo de nuevo en ellos y el sueño evadió de nuevo.Ella estaba mirando a sí misma en el abrazo de su familia, mientras que Inuyasha fue empujado de nuevo en el pozo, mirando tan sorprendido como se había sentido. Los recuerdos de ese momento, esos sentimientos, seguían siendo tan fuertes, el sentimiento de angustia y tristeza brotaba de nuevo, aunque había pasado tanto tiempo desde que había sentido que había sido arrancada de todo lo que le importaba.<br/><br/>Por supuesto que su familia importaba, y ella estaba feliz de estar en sus brazos de nuevo. Ella nunca pudo describir completamente, realmente cómo se había sentido en esos días. Todavía no podía explicar la forma en que se sentía dividida en dos, con deseos en guerra de estar tanto en su pasado como en su presente. Recordó los vanos intentos de saltar a través del pozo, con los dedos arañando el suelo en una súplica desesperada para dejarla regresar. El primer mes en casa, no durmió tanto como lloró.<br/><br/>Elysion había embargado una reacción similar, aunque no era tan feroz porque no sabía exactamente por dónde se había deslizado ni sabía dónde podía recorrer su camino de regreso. Sus exploraciones fueron sutiles entre trabajar en su trabajo y tratar de establecerse en esta vida. No tenía intenciones de quedarse, no tenía intenciones de permanecer más tiempo del que necesitaba. Y aunque no lo intentó tan ferozmente como cuando trató de regresar al pasado, su pasión era diez veces mayor porque no tenía vínculos con este mundo, porque estaba realmente sola... sin esperanza de que nadie la alcanzara.<br/><br/>En sus momentos irracionales, pensó que la Joya la había tirado hacia atrás y había encontrado un nuevo infierno para que ella residiera, un nuevo infierno que la obligaría a pedir un deseo, pero recordó muy claramente que había deseado que se fuera para siempre. Eso no detuvo sus sueños, los momentos en que se despertaba sollozando, y esos recuerdos de su pasado eran los más difíciles de tratar, los más difíciles de olvidar. Su corazón comenzó a correr en pánico cuando se volvió en su cama de nuevo, su aliento se convirtió en una lucha mientras luchaba contra un ataque de pánico inducido por su mente errante tan tarde en la noche.<br/><br/>Odiaba sentirse tan débil, tan asustada.<br/><br/>?<br/><br/>Kagome finalmente se levantó de la cama, su habitación iluminada con una luz pálida que era suficiente para guiarla al baño. Se paró frente al espejo, el fregadero corriendo mientras miraba su reflejo. El cabello de Raven le cubría la cara y se sentía tan mal como parecía. Su primera mañana en Elysion fue similar a esto, solo que estaba en peor forma.<br/><br/>Había encontrado un lugar para dormir, logrando llegar a un acuerdo con el propietario del edificio para permitirle quedarse un pequeño período de tiempo sin pagar. Tal vez fue la influencia de Miroku lo que le permitió llegar a tales acuerdos, ya que el monje era conocido por su manera de cautivar (o estafar) a las personas para que les dieran más que suficiente por el trabajo que habían hecho. El monje siempre había sido así, desde que se conocieron. Afirmaría que la morada de un señor estaba embrujada cuando no lo estaba o, afirmaría que estaban sujetos a un ataque cuando no lo estaban. Vendería sus pupilos y encantos por precios tan altos. Funcionó prácticamente cada vez y se preguntó por qué la gente había estado tan dispuesta a confiar en él.<br/><br/>Tal vez fue su sonrisa, o el hecho de que era un monje que la gente del pasado estaba tan dispuesta a desmoronarse. Nunca se aprovechó de los débiles, al menos. Siempre hacía lo correcto y era un símbolo de fuerza para ella en momentos en que empujaba todo para hacer lo correcto. Empujó el hecho de que estaba muriendo, que estaba maldito, y trató de hacer algo al respecto en lugar de revolcarse en su destino. Se había empujado al límite en el tiempo previo a su pelea final. Y ella se había alegrado de que hubieran derrotado a Naraku antes de que él pudiera estar sujeto al mismo destino que su padre, y su padre antes que él.<br/><br/>Sin embargo, en lo que respecta a sus propios encantos, era más justa que su amiga e hizo que el trato fuera razonable. Dudaba que alguien en este mundo pagara un alto precio por un exorcismo o desterrar demonios. Eran demasiado avanzados tecnológicamente para eso. Pero ella era lo suficientemente inteligente, y lo suficientemente inteligente, para hacer un buen trato.<br/><br/>Pero ahora, Kagome estaba en un lugar mejor, aunque la mirada en su rostro se veía igual.<br/><br/>Una rápida mirada a un reloj en la pared le dijo que podía intentar dormir más tiempo, pero optó por no hacerlo, ya que no quería volver a enfrentarse a los flashbacks. En cambio, se duchó, usando el agua fría para ahuyentar a sus demonios, para llenar sus pulmones con una fuerte ingesta de aliento y obligarse a despertar.<br/><br/>?<br/><br/>No funcionó.<br/><br/>No de la manera que ella quería. El agua fría ciertamente forzó el aire en sus pulmones, forzó su mente a despertar y los músculos a agarrar. Una risa amarga fue sacada de sus labios mientras inclinaba su cabeza hacia atrás y se encontraba recordando más. Hoy, ella no iba a escapar tan fácilmente, no iba a recuperarse tan simplemente, para recuperarse solo porque lo quería.<br/><br/>A veces, no se puede evitar los pensamientos que querías, incluso cuando estabas seguro de que los habías pasado.<br/><br/>Sango habría sido una gran ayuda en esta situación. La cazadora de demonios era su mejor amiga, incluso iría tan lejos como para llamarla la hermana que nunca tuvo. Una hermana mayor que era sabia, siempre tenía su lado cuando surgían los problemas. Particularmente problemas de chicos, cuando tales cosas eran bastante triviales, pero era divertido enamorarse y que su amiga se enojara en su nombre cuando Inuyasha la entristecía. Después de todo, había sido a menudo que el medio demonio corría al lado de su amante muerto y le rompía el corazón más de una vez.<br/><br/>Pero, Sango también la inspiró de otras maneras. Después de todo lo que la mujer había enfrentado, siempre había sido tan fuerte, tan segura... Incluso en los momentos en que había dudado de sí misma, siempre se las arregló para salir adelante. Admiraba que tuviera la capacidad de sobrevivir después de perder a toda su familia, el recordatorio de esto a menudo empujaba a Kagome a sobrevivir, porque perdió a todos en este mundo, y luego hacer que su hermano se convirtiera en un peón de Naraku. No fue fácil, no podría haber sido algo que cualquiera pudiera enfrentar y seguir adelante. Ella todavía sonreía, incluso con ese dolor y esos recordatorios... A menudo era tan brillante, incluso en los tiempos más oscuros.<br/><br/>Y en este momento, ella quería apoyarse en el lado de la mujer mayor, para consolarse en el hecho de que ella estaba allí y ella era de apoyo. Ella sintió que Sango de alguna manera sacaría adelante esto, y ofrecer algunas palabras de fuerza y comprensión. Fueron momentos como estos los que empeoraron estos hechizos, el recordatorio constante de que estaba sin su familia.<br/><br/>-No quiero estar sola -exclamó en voz alta en su soledad, el sonido de la ducha ahogando la súplica-.<br/><br/>No tenía miedo de admitirlo.<br/><br/>?<br/><br/>Había pasado otra hora antes de que se diera cuenta. Tenía la piel fría del agua y parecía que el hielo corría por sus venas. No se había dado cuenta de que había comenzado a temblar hasta que su mano alcanzó para apagar el agua y terminar con su ducha. Kagome no volvió a buscar su propia mirada en el espejo, sino que se envolvió en toallas y salió caminando del baño, subió las escaleras y entró en su cocina. Comenzó a hacer un desayuno ligero, leyendo ociosamente sus notas del día mientras la comida se cocinaba.<br/><br/>Su carrera estaba realmente despegando estos últimos años. Sus fotos aparecieron en muchas galerías, su nombre comenzó a frecuentar muchos labios para aquellos que estaban interesados en la fotografía.<br/><br/>El trabajo que ella había pedido por capricho lo había provocado todo. Ella había sido mucho más afortunada de lo que esperaba ser en este mundo. Nunca tuvo la suerte de deslizarse de nuevo a través de las grietas en su propio mundo, pero tuvo la suerte de hacerlo bien. Cuando volvió a la estufa, recordó el momento en que finalmente había renunciado a regresar a casa. Fue alrededor de dos años en su vida aquí, ya que había comenzado a aventurarse en la fotografía como algo más que un hobby, pero algo con lo que podía hacerse un nombre.<br/><br/>Ese día había sido particularmente agradable, el sol estaba alto en el cielo y se había encontrado tomando algunas fotos del paisaje natural. Un niño pequeño se había escondido en una de las plantas, y ella había captado una imagen del momento en que su rostro se había asentado en una sonrisa alegre y maliciosa el momento antes de que hubiera saltado para asustar a su presa. Le recordó a Shippou, el pequeño kitsune que ella había adoptado. Él también había sido arrancado de su familia cuando se conocieron. Su padre mató y estaba decidido a vengarlo. Cuando era joven, parecía tan maduro en sus primeros encuentros.<br/><br/>Tal vez fue la influencia de Inuyasha lo que permitió que el kit actuara como un niño nuevamente, que fuera joven y caprichoso a veces, mientras que otros eran más maduros. Él le ofreció consuelo a su manera, y ella trató de cuidarlo como lo haría a su manera, aunque también había sido muy joven, sin embargo, su juventud no le impidió entender cómo cuidarlo o cuidarlo como su hijo. Su corazón se le hinchaba cuando sonreía, cuando había estado tan feliz por su regalo de crayones y se había tomado el tiempo para hacer arte. Estaba tan orgullosa de cada dibujo que había terminado que sabía que así era como se sentiría una madre en tal situación.<br/><br/>El dolor que la había desgarrado era demasiado, demasiado repentino. Ella lo extrañaba y quería ver cuánto había crecido desde que se había ido. Ella había extrañado tanto...<br/><br/>Para ahorrarse más dolor, falsas esperanzas... se dio por vencida y se enfocó en mejorarse a sí misma.<br/><br/>?<br/><br/>El desayuno sabía soso, aburrido e inspirado, y sólo después de que había terminado se dio cuenta de que se había olvidado de cualquier tipo de especias o sabor de la comida. Era demasiado tarde para recordar eso, ya que su mente estaba demasiado ocupada recordando otros detalles de su vida que claramente se habían vuelto más importantes que su comida.<br/><br/>"¡Siéntate!"<br/><br/>Por supuesto, no pasó nada cuando ella le gritó airadamente a un cliente particularmente frustrante que le recordaba al medio demonio. Él estaba siendo particularmente terco y grosero, que quería que le tomaran una foto en lugar de dejar que funcionara naturalmente. Podrías tratar de obligar a los animales salvajes a comportarse como quisieras, pero rara vez alguien tuvo éxito con la fuerza. Sin embargo, Inuyasha no era tan mala. Inuyasha había aprendido antes de que la obligaran a alejarse de él. Se había vuelto más gentil, más comprensivo, más maduro, aunque había veces que todavía era infantil y engreído.<br/><br/>Recordó lo rojas que estaban sus mejillas, pero cómo se mantuvo firme y lo despidió, y le dijo que se negaba a trabajar para cualquiera o con cualquiera que quisiera torcer algo más allá de su naturaleza, más allá de sus propios deseos.<br/><br/>Debería haber comparado al hombre con Naraku en lugar de Inuyasha. Aunque su cliente no tenía intenciones tan extremas. Al menos la sensación después fue un recuerdo agradable. La libertad de saber que había llegado tan lejos que podía rechazar un trabajo que no quería hacer, ser su propia persona que era independiente de los demás. Podría decir que lo hizo en ese momento. A pesar de que escuchó rumores días después con palabras destinadas a calumniarla.<br/><br/>Ella se defendió con rectitud, como lo hizo hacia el final de su viaje. Después de todo, ella era la única que podía protegerse en este mundo.<br/><br/>?<br/><br/>La luz de la mañana comenzó a entrar en su casa, recordándole nuevamente el paso del tiempo. Una vez más, consideró la lista de cosas que tenía que hacer y debatió sobre dónde comenzar. O, si siquiera debería comenzar. Con cómo comenzó el día, no sabía si podía considerar que era una gran idea. Era dudoso que tuviera éxito con lo perdida en sí misma que se estaba convirtiendo.<br/><br/>No quería estropear su último trabajo porque lo había hecho en varias ocasiones antes, no era agradable tratar de recuperarse de un completo desastre.<br/><br/>Kagome recordó la sensación de su costosa y nueva cámara que se le escapaba de las manos. No estaba preparada para soportarla, porque acababa de sacarla de su bolso. Parte de ella gritó por dentro. Un dramático, exagerado, lleno de gritos que hacía con frecuencia cuando era mucho, mucho más joven. Cuando estaba luchando para llegar a la escuela secundaria mientras saltaba entre tiempos. La otra parte de ella había permanecido congelada en su lugar mientras su lente se rompía por completo y el resto de la cámara se había roto junto con ella.<br/><br/>Ver al hermano de Inuyasha, un demonio completo, de pie delante de ella era lo último que esperaba cuando había salido para sus fotos. Se mantuvo tan orgulloso como siempre, tan alto como siempre, tan imponente como ella recordaba. No parecía en absoluto desconcertado por estar en un mundo completamente diferente, aunque ella nunca fue la mejor en leer su mente. Su nombre en sus labios era tan potente, que podía recordar los sentimientos más pequeños como lo hizo. Sus labios estaban agrietados, su boca se sentía seca y la sensación burbujeante de ansiedad en su estómago la hacía sentir enferma.<br/><br/>Ella no quería que sus esperanzas se levantaran.<br/><br/>Pero ella quería que él estuviera allí, incluso si no eran amigos. Eran aliados, en todo caso, ya que habían luchado uno al lado del otro. Y algo era mejor que absolutamente nada.<br/><br/>Y Kagome tuvo el suficiente sentido común como para no lanzarse a él, para envolver sus brazos alrededor de él en alivio de saber que ella no estaba sola. Su cámara ya no importaba cuando se acercaba a él. Recordó que nada más importaba durante días mientras pasaba tiempo con él, no hablando de su mundo sino hablando (o, ella estaba hablando y él simplemente reconoció ese hecho).<br/><br/>Cuando, exactamente, ella se enamoró de él, Kagome no podía recordarlo, era algo sutil, como él, pero ella sabía que el sentimiento estaba allí, y él le hizo saber que ella no estaba sola en el hecho de que ella se había caído, que los sentimientos habían florecido de alguna manera.<br/><br/>?<br/><br/>Una sensación de ingravidez la alcanzó y de repente sus ojos se abrieron mientras su mente arañaba desesperadamente por lo último que estaba haciendo. No recordaba cuándo se había quedado dormida en su sofá, pero sabía que el último lugar donde había estado era en los cojines demasiado cómodos. Sin embargo, no luchó ni luchó contra la ingravidez, ya que estaba en brazos familiares. Su cabeza se inclinó contra el pecho de Sesshoumaru, reconfortándose con el hecho de que él estaba aquí y ella no estaba sola.<br/><br/>"Bienvenido de vuelta". Su respuesta fue un suave zumbido en reconocimiento. No necesitaba hablar mucho para que ella entendiera su intención, o el resto de lo que tenía que decir.<br/><br/>La llevó de regreso a su cama, la colocó en ella con facilidad. Sus ojos se encontraron con los de él y ella sonrió fácilmente porque no había más recuerdos a la deriva, no más recuerdos se burlaban de ella. No, cada vez que estaba cerca, ella nunca volvió a caer en esos pensamientos. Él había ayudado, y los años habían ayudado. Hoy era solo... uno de esos días.<br/><br/>"Dormir." Mandó con facilidad, sus ojos giraron hacia él, pero ella no peleó porque estaba cansada. Su mano se aferró firmemente a él, mientras ella sentía su mano opuesta presionarse contra su frente para evaluar su bienestar.<br/><br/>"Estoy bien", dijo ella, sus palabras firmes con su promesa.<br/><br/>Estaba bien, estaba viva y era feliz.<br/><br/>?<br/><br/>expedidor<br/><br/>resumen<br/><br/>Kagome, en un momento de su vida, era una adolescente bastante regular hasta que fue atacada por un demonio dentro de la casa del pozo de su familia. El demonio la arrastró hacia el pozo, que mágicamente la transportó unos 500 años en el pasado. Allí, se enteró de que una joya sagrada estaba encerrada dentro de su cuerpo, ya que ella era la reencarnación de una sacerdotisa que había muerto 50 años antes del momento en que fue arrastrada. La joya fue arrancada de su cuerpo y el demonio que la arrastró a través del tiempo fue derrotado por el medio demonio que liberó que fue clavado en el árbol. Kagome se hizo amiga del medio demonio, Inuyasha, en el tiempo y viajó con él para restaurar la joya que ella misma destrozó, aunque no era tan sencillo y fácil de hacer como muchos demonios y humanos buscaron la joya para sus propios fines. Se hizo amiga de un joven demonio kitsune, un monje y un cazador de demonios que viajaron con ella para restaurar la joya.<br/><br/>Su grupo, sin embargo, no fue el que completó la joya. En cambio, un demonio medio malvado que manipuló la mayoría de los eventos importantes en la mayoría de las vidas de su compañero. Cuando finalmente recogió todas las piezas de la joya e hizo su deseo sobre el objeto contaminado, Kagome fue atraído hacia la joya misma con la intención de que ella hiciera un deseo egoísta de mantenerla atrapada dentro para siempre, manteniendo viva la joya. Fue la terquedad de Inuyasha la que logró salvarla de la oscuridad. Al final, regresó a su tiempo natural, terminó la escuela secundaria como se esperaba de una chica de su línea de tiempo. Aunque días después, Kagome terminó en Elysion. Ella ha estado en este mundo durante cinco años, y desde hace mucho tiempo ha renunciado a regresar a casa.<br/><br/>platónico<br/><br/>Es bastante fácil para Kagome hacer nuevos amigos, ella no ha cambiado mucho desde su juventud. Ella es una joven alegre que es empática y acogedora sobre todo en su vida. En su juventud, se hizo amiga de los demonios cuando la mayoría les temería. Incluso los demonios que solían comer humanos, ella se ha hecho amiga y ha cambiado sus formas (a ella le gustaría pensar). Dicho esto, es muy fácil convertirse en su amigo, siempre y cuando alguien sea capaz de demostrar que están dispuestos a ser redimidos, o demostrar que no son completamente malvados. Ella siente mucho por todos los que conoce, por lo que es difícil para ella no sentirse atraída por los demás en un deseo de ser amiga.<br/><br/>antagónico<br/><br/>La única manera de ganarse la ira de Kagome es ser tan deplorable, tan malvada, y tan lejos de la redención que no pueda ver nada bueno en ti. Un medio demonio que enfrentó a dos amantes el uno contra el otro, que maldijo toda la línea masculina de uno de sus amigos, y luego hizo que el hermano de su mejor amiga matara a su familia ... Sí, no la veo odiando a nadie sin ellos realmente, realmente trabajando para ello. Sin embargo, siéntase libre de intentarlo.<br/><br/>romántico<br/><br/>Cuando está enamorada, Kagome es un fuerte apoyo, siempre quedándose allí, incluso cuando las cosas pueden ser difíciles. Sin embargo, Kagome no está buscando el amor, no estaba buscando el amor cuando llegó por lo que las relaciones pasadas no existen. Esto no quiere decir que alguien no se haya enamorado de ella.

| Why You Should be on Twitter<br/><br/>Disclaimer: I am not, nor have I ever claimed to be, a social media guru. I'm just a person who thinks about stuff a lot, and this has come up a number of times.<br/><br/>I'm not an early adopter. Sometimes it takes me years to figure out what I want to use something for before I actually get on it, and Twitter was one of those things. I've been on Twitter seriously since about February of this year, so I'm pretty new at it. Still, I've learned a number of things, and I wanted to share them. Some people say I'm a Twitter pusher, and I am, because there's lots of good reasons to get on it, and virtually no downsides.<br/><br/>So what's Twitter? If you're on the internet, you've probably at least heard of it. It's a social media network that serves as a forum for conversations, updates, and news in a medium more public than something like Facebook or LinkedIn. Facebook is about who wants to find you, but Twitter is about who you want to find. Your favourite writers, actors, politicians, singers, and scientists are probably on Twitter. So are your favourite charities, radio stations, news sites, and stores. And they want you to find them and listen to what they have to say. Everyone on Twitter, at least initially, wants to talk with you.<br/><br/>But why join that? Why be a part of it? There's all kinds of reasons, and I'm going to give you a few.<br/><br/>People and Places Twitter is a great way to find out about events which are going on around the world, but also in your community. If you're travelling and looking for things to do, it's a great way to find out about things relevant to your interests (because the people you follow are people you're interested in). Even if you're not travelling, knowing about great places to go locally or knowing that people you're interested in are going to them creates an opportunity to meet them and create a deeper relationship with them. If you go back to my party post, all the people in it but two, I heard about on Twitter and then met in real life, and now we're pretty good friends. And the more you do this, the more things you'll find out about, and the more people you'll meet. And if you follow them on Twitter, you already know a bit about what they're like. They want you to. The reverse is also true, because tweeting invites people to see what you're like, and they can make the same choices about you.<br/><br/>Inspiration and Motivation<br/>Inspiration comes from the strangest places, and the influx of tweets means there's always fresh content for your imagination. I have a follow first policy, so I'll follow just about anybody, and then periodically go through and unfollow people. I don't know who's going to plant the seed of a new blog post or new project in me, so I like to keep my options open. Motivation also happens, because Twitter is just like life. If you surround yourself with people who are ambitious, dedicated, generous, and hard-working, it's easier to be like that, and push yourself. It's easier to think that if they can plan events, launch projects, or just get up in the morning, well, so can you.<br/><br/>Learning and Lifestyle Bloggers are on Twitter. Bloggers who aren't may actually be crazy. And people blog about just about everything. If you're looking to learn something, odds are good that somebody's tweeting about it. On top of that, news services and stores are also connected, which means that you can get your news up to the minute, and find out about sales and deals as they start.As far as lifestyle, looking for new recipe ideas? Follow some caterers and see what they come up with. Need a twist for that cocktail party? Twitter's got people for that too. Wardrobe recommendations, or just want to see what other people are doing with their lives? It's all there.<br/><br/>There are some common challenges I face when talking about this, and they're legitimate obstacles. It can seem pretty daunting, especially if you're getting on the bandwagon late, like I did. I spent months following only two people and not knowing what else to do. But there are ways to overcome them, and hear they are from least frequent to most.<br/><br/>#3: Twitter is for Narcissistic Jerks<br/>I think this comes from the idea that most people tweet for and about themselves as a way of getting attention. What I don't get is why there's anything wrong with that, or why doing that makes one a narcissist or a jerk. If someone has something to say, they want to be heard. Used to be you'd stand on the street corner and yell. Now you can yell in 140 characters or less. Twitter's just a new way to be heard. Now, there are certainly narcissistic jerks on Twitter. They're pretty much everywhere. Sometimes, people are jerks. Sometimes one of those people is me, I'm sorry to say. Don't follow those people. If you don't like what someone is saying, whether that's points that they're making or detailed accounts of their bathroom activities, you don't have to listen on Twitter.<br/><br/>#2: I Can't Keep Track of It All<br/>The second obstacle people often bring up is that they just don't have time to keep track of all the things which are going on on Twitter. And you know what? That's fine. Keep track of what you can. Maybe you only wander on every few days. If you're a private user (rather than tweeting for your company), and especially a beginner, that's okay. Part of something is better than all of nothing.<br/><br/>#1 I've Got Nothing I Want to Put Out There<br/>This is by far the most frequent challenge people raise. And it doesn't even matter. You don't have to join Twitter to talk. Join it to listen. Again, your favourite authors, singers, bloggers, and newspapers are on here. This is your chance to listen to them. It's your chance to gain a window into their lives and activities, and they're inviting you to do that. Want to find out what Felicia Day is going to be up to at the San Diego Comic Con? Done. I know people who only listen on Twitter, and that's great. That's what I did for a while. Eventually, maybe you'll find something to tweet about, or make something to tweet about. I hope you do, because I want to hear about it.<br/><br/>In short, if you're not using Twitter, I think you should be. If you're not using it to its full extent, try to. Don't be afraid to follow five hundred people, if all of those people are saying things you're interested in. Invite those people into bits of your life, and see how it's improved by the interaction. I look forward to hearing from you. | Por qué deberías estar en Twitter<br/><br/>Disclaimer: No soy, ni he afirmado ser, un gurú de las redes sociales. Solo soy una persona que piensa mucho en cosas, y esto ha surgido varias veces.<br/><br/>No soy un adoptante temprano. A veces me toma años averiguar para qué quiero usar algo antes de que realmente lo haga, y Twitter fue una de esas cosas. He estado en Twitter en serio desde febrero de este año, así que soy bastante nuevo en eso. Aún así, he aprendido varias cosas, y quería compartirlas. Algunas personas dicen que soy un empujador de Twitter, y lo soy, porque hay muchas buenas razones para hacerlo, y prácticamente no hay inconvenientes.<br/><br/>Entonces, ¿qué es Twitter? Si estás en Internet, es probable que al menos hayas oído hablar de él. Es una red social que sirve como foro para conversaciones, actualizaciones y noticias en un medio más público que algo como Facebook o LinkedIn. Facebook se trata de quién quiere encontrarte, pero Twitter se trata de a quién quieres encontrar. Tus escritores, actores, políticos, cantantes y científicos favoritos probablemente estén en Twitter. También lo están tus organizaciones benéficas, estaciones de radio, sitios de noticias y tiendas favoritas. Y quieren que los encuentres y escuches lo que tienen que decir. Todos en Twitter, al menos inicialmente, quieren hablar contigo.<br/><br/>Pero ¿por qué unirse a eso? ¿Por qué ser parte de eso? Hay todo tipo de razones, y voy a darte algunas.<br/><br/>Twitter es una gran manera de averiguar acerca de los eventos que están sucediendo en todo el mundo, sino también en su comunidad. Si viajas y buscas cosas que hacer, es una excelente manera de descubrir cosas relevantes para tus intereses (porque las personas que sigues son personas que te interesan). Incluso si no viajas, conoces buenos lugares para ir localmente o sabes que las personas que te interesan van a ellos, crea una oportunidad para conocerlos y crear una relación más profunda con ellos. Si vuelves a mi post de la fiesta, toda la gente en ella, excepto dos, me enteré en Twitter y luego me encontré en la vida real, y ahora somos muy buenos amigos. Y cuanto más hagas esto, más cosas te enterarás, y más gente conocerás. Y si los sigues en Twitter, ya sabes un poco sobre cómo son. Quieren que lo hagas. Lo contrario también es cierto, porque tuitear invita a las personas a ver cómo eres, y pueden tomar las mismas decisiones sobre ti.<br/><br/>Inspiración y Motivación<br/>La inspiración viene de los lugares más extraños, y la afluencia de tweets significa que siempre hay contenido fresco para su imaginación. Tengo una política de seguir primero, así que seguiré a casi cualquier persona, y luego periódicamente ir a través y dejar de seguir a la gente. No sé quién va a plantar la semilla de una nueva entrada de blog o un nuevo proyecto en mí, así que me gusta mantener mis opciones abiertas. La motivación también sucede, porque Twitter es como la vida. Si te rodeas de personas ambiciosas, dedicadas, generosas y trabajadoras, es más fácil ser así y esforzarse. Es más fácil pensar que si pueden planificar eventos, lanzar proyectos o simplemente levantarse por la mañana, bueno, tú también puedes.<br/><br/>Los bloggers de aprendizaje y estilo de vida están en Twitter. Bloggers que no lo están en realidad pueden estar locos. Y la gente bloguea sobre casi todo. Si estás buscando aprender algo, las probabilidades son buenas de que alguien esté twitteando al respecto. Además de eso, los servicios de noticias y las tiendas también están conectados, lo que significa que puede obtener sus noticias al minuto, y averiguar sobre ventas y ofertas a medida que comienzan. En cuanto al estilo de vida, ¿busca nuevas ideas de recetas? Sigue a algunos proveedores y ve lo que se les ocurre. ¿Necesitas un giro para ese cóctel? Twitter tiene gente para eso también. Recomendaciones de vestuario, o simplemente quieres ver lo que otras personas están haciendo con sus vidas? Todo está ahí.<br/><br/>Hay algunos desafíos comunes que enfrento cuando hablo de esto, y son obstáculos legítimos. Puede parecer bastante desalentador, especialmente si te subes al tren tarde, como lo hice. Pasé meses siguiendo solo a dos personas y sin saber qué más hacer, pero hay formas de superarlas y escuchar que son de menos a más frecuentes.<br/><br/>Artículo siguienteTwitter es para narcisistas<br/>Creo que esto proviene de la idea de que la mayoría de la gente twittea para sí misma y sobre sí misma como una forma de llamar la atención. Lo que no entiendo es por qué hay algo malo en eso, o por qué hacer eso hace que uno sea un narcisista o un idiota. Si alguien tiene algo que decir, quiere ser escuchado. Solía ser que te parabas en la esquina de la calle y gritabas. Ahora puedes gritar en 140 caracteres o menos. Twitter es solo una nueva forma de ser escuchado. Ahora, ciertamente hay idiotas narcisistas en Twitter. Están casi en todas partes. A veces, las personas son idiotas. A veces una de esas personas soy yo, siento decirlo. No sigas a esas personas. Si no te gusta lo que alguien está diciendo, ya sean puntos que están haciendo o cuentas detalladas de sus actividades en el baño, no tienes que escuchar en Twitter.<br/><br/>Capítulo 2: No puedo estar al tanto de todo<br/>El segundo obstáculo que la gente suele mencionar es que simplemente no tienen tiempo para hacer un seguimiento de todas las cosas que están sucediendo en Twitter. ¿Y sabes qué? Está bien. Haz un seguimiento de lo que puedes. Tal vez solo paseas cada pocos días. Si eres un usuario privado (en lugar de tuitear para tu empresa), y especialmente un principiante, está bien. Parte de algo es mejor que todo de nada.<br/><br/>1 No tengo nada que quiero poner ahí fuera<br/>Este es, con mucho, el desafío más frecuente que las personas plantean. Y ni siquiera importa. No tienes que unirte a Twitter para hablar. únete a él para escuchar. Una vez más, tus autores, cantantes, bloggers y periódicos favoritos están aquí. Esta es tu oportunidad de escucharlos. Es tu oportunidad de obtener una ventana a sus vidas y actividades, y te invitan a hacerlo. ¿Quieres saber qué hará Felicia Day en la Comic Con de San Diego? Conozco personas que solo escuchan en Twitter, y eso es genial. Eso es lo que hice por un tiempo. Eventualmente, tal vez encuentres algo sobre lo que tuitear o hagas algo sobre lo que tuitear. Espero que lo hagas, porque quiero escucharlo.<br/><br/>En resumen, si no estás usando Twitter, creo que deberías. Si no lo estás usando en toda su extensión, inténtalo. No tengas miedo de seguir a quinientas personas, si todas esas personas están diciendo cosas que te interesan. Invite a esas personas a partes de su vida, y vea cómo ha mejorado por la interacción. Espero escuchar de usted. |
| Root Canals<br/><br/>The very thought of getting a root canal puts most people on edge. SCM Dental utilizes the latest technology and technique to make a root canal a virtually pain free and low stress procedure.<br/><br/>Rotary endodontics is an advanced technology and technique to perform endodontic treatment, the clinical term for a root canalThe term "root canal" refers to the natural cavity at the center of the tooth. The tooth's nerve is located in soft tissue (pulp) inside the root canal. If the tooth is damaged either by trauma or decay, debris can enter the sensitive root canal area and cause an infection, or in extreme circumstances, and abscess. An abscessed tooth is very serious and should be treated as an emergency, as it can create an infection that may spread to other parts of the body. If you believe you have an abscessed tooth, contact our office immediately to schedule emergency care.<br/><br/>Depending on the case, root canal therapy may require more than one visit. An initial x-ray will be taken to evaluate the tooth and root canal and determine the extent of the damage and infection if present. You will be given a form of anesthesia to make you relaxed.<br/><br/>When the area is numb, our dentist will create an access chamber to the root canal using an electric handpiece. Next, the root canal will be scraped of the infected or damaged tissue and nerve. Once the entire area has been throughly cleaned and polished, the tooth will be filled with a biocompatible rubber compound called gutta percha. The tooth is then covered with a dental filling or dental crown to restore strength and function.<br/><br/>Endodontic therapy has a bad reputation as being a painful procedure. With rotary endodontics, a root canal procedure is no more painful than having a dental filling placed. The infection and damage to the nerve is what creates the extreme pain and discomfort and patients you will experience significant relief after undergoing root canal therapy. Root canals have a success rate of 95% and allow people to preserve their natural teeth. | Canales de raíz<br/><br/>La idea de conseguir un tratamiento de conducto pone a la mayoría de la gente en el borde.SCM Dental utiliza la última tecnología y técnica para hacer un tratamiento de conducto un procedimiento prácticamente libre de dolor y bajo estrés.<br/><br/>La endodoncia rotatoria es una tecnología y técnica avanzada para realizar el tratamiento de endodoncia, el término clínico para un conducto radicular. El término "canal radicular" se refiere a la cavidad natural en el centro del diente. El nervio del diente se encuentra en el tejido blando (pulpa) dentro del conducto radicular.Si el diente está dañado por un traumatismo o caries, los desechos pueden entrar en el área sensible del conducto radicular y causar una infección, o en circunstancias extremas, y absceso. Un absceso dental es muy grave y debe tratarse como una emergencia, ya que puede crear una infección que puede propagarse a otras partes del cuerpo. Si cree que tiene un absceso dental, comuníquese con nuestra oficina inmediatamente para programar la atención de emergencia.<br/><br/>Dependiendo del caso, la terapia de conducto radicular puede requerir más de una visita. Se tomará una radiografía inicial para evaluar el diente y el conducto radicular y determinar la extensión del daño y la infección si está presente. Se le administrará una forma de anestesia para que se relaje.<br/><br/>Cuando el área está adormecida, nuestro dentista creará una cámara de acceso al conducto radicular con una pieza de mano eléctrica. A continuación, el conducto radicular se raspará del tejido y el nervio infectados o dañados. Una vez que toda el área ha sido limpiada y pulida, el diente se llenará con un compuesto de goma biocompatible llamado gutapercha. El diente se cubre con un relleno dental o corona dental para restaurar la fuerza y la función.<br/><br/>La terapia de endodoncia tiene una mala reputación de ser un procedimiento doloroso. Con la endodoncia rotatoria, un procedimiento de conducto radicular no es más doloroso que tener un empaste dental colocado. La infección y el daño al nervio es lo que crea el dolor extremo y el malestar y los pacientes experimentarán un alivio significativo después de someterse a una terapia de conducto radicular. Los conductos radiculares tienen una tasa de éxito del 95% y permiten a las personas preservar sus dientes naturales. |
| Churchyard Bottom Wood<br/><br/>Highgate<br/><br/>Churchyard Bottom Wood, Highgate<br/><br/>Now called Queen's Wood<br/><br/>Between 1860 and 1880 the centre was torn out of the City of London to build sewers, railways and new roads. Houses were demolished without regard for the tenants who had to find whatever accommodation they could elsewhere. Managers went to livo in Kensington and St. John's Wood, while the poorest crowded into the rookeries like Seven Dials and Lisson Grove. For those between, the clerks and skilled workmen, speculative builders put up row after row of terraced villas and Mr Pooter moved into Holloway. The people of Muswell Hill watched houses creep across the fields of Finsbury Park, up Crouch Hill and down the other side, so that by 1880, Crouch End was being developed and there seemed no way to stem the flow. Ten years later the large estates of Muswell Hill were being sold. Upton Farm was sold and the Ecclesiastical Commissioners wanted to develop Churchyard Bottom Wood, now called Queen's Wood. The story would have made an Ibsen play. Two groups of honest, highly motivated people fighting for what they each thought was right. The Ecclesiastical Commissioners on the one hand and the Committee of the Hornsey Charities on the other, both believed they were doing their best for other people, and the public rose against them both in indignation<br/><br/>At that time Muswell Hill Road was a country road, with Southwood Hall at one end and Upton Farm at the other. By 1894, Onslow Gardens was built, Connaught Gardens marked out, and builders were poised to develop the Woodlands estate. Cut out of Churchyard Bottom Wood was a group of tumble-down cottages, on a triangular site. An undated map, held by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners shows six Wasteland Cottages with an opening between them - not a road, not metalled, but a way through to the strawberry beds behind. Further along was another gap which led to footpaths through the wood. These two openings were to be the basis of the plan. The same two gaps and the cleared ground, which was the strawberry field, can be seen in the 1894 map below. They are shown as 'Muswell Hill Cottages' and, quite in passing, Peter Sellers was to live on the same site much later on. To develop the wood as a housing estate, the Commissioners needed to drive two roads through from Muswell Hill Road and build houses along them. The Muswell Hill Road frontage alone would not have provided room for enough houses to make the venture worthwhile.<br/><br/>The land and cottages had been given much earlier as almshouses to house old people and were held on their behalf by the Trustees of the Hornsey Charity Commissioners. By the 1890s the cottages were tumble-down, in need of major repair. Public-spirited, wishing to do the best for their old tenants, the Trustees could not improve them since they had no money. Some years before the Ecclesiastical Commissioners had planned to develop Gravel Pit Wood (now Highgate Wood) as a housing estate, but this had met such opposition that they backed down. Instead, in 1886, they gave all 69 acres woodland to the public. At the same time they offered to sell Churchyard Bottom Wood to Hornsey Urban District Council for £25,000, but this was too much for Hornsey to raise on its own. The Council said that people living outside Hornsey also enjoyed the wood and other authorities should help, but no help was given. In the end the offer fell into abeyance.<br/><br/>Map showing the Muswell Hill Cottages which were the centre of the controversy.<br/><br/>Muswell Hill Road about 1880<br/><br/>It seems probable that these three pairs of cottages<br/>were the ones at the centre of the dispute.<br/><br/>The Ecclesiastical Commissioners wanted to raise money for its church work in Britain and abroad. They considered that they had been given the land to be used for the propogat­ion of religion and if this meant selling off land or woods, it was a lesser evil than restricting the work of the church. They had given Gravel Pit Wood to the public: in its place they would develop Churchyard Bottom Wood.<br/><br/>The Trustees of the Hornsey Charities wanted to produce an income to help their poor people, so they made an offer to the Commissioners. Their triangular piece of land was too awkwardly shaped to be developed economically, but if the Commissioners would grant them some more land to make it into a square site, they would build twenty-five neat villas. These would bring in ground rents of £225 per annum, which could be used to relieve the poverty of Hornsey people. In return they would permit the Commission­ers to cut two roads through their land so that the Commissioners could develop the woods.<br/><br/>When this offer became known people immediately reacted with alarm.<br/><br/>On the 16th December 1893 Mr Carvell Williams MP asked in the House of Commons, if the Ecclesiastical Commissioners had consented to sell a strip of land to the Hornsey Charities Trustees on condition that an existing road be widened to 40 feet, whether this was a preliminary to a building scheme and if the House of Parliament would have an opportunity to express an opinion.<br/><br/>Mr Leveson Gower, a Church Estates Commissioner replied',"Yes" to the first part.<br/><br/>Mr Carvell Williams, "Do I understand it is the intention to destroy that portion of Highgate Woods by building on it?"<br/><br/>Two days later The Star published an article worthy of any modern tabloid.<br/><br/>The Star<br/>18th December 1893<br/><br/>'Parliament must keep a keen watch on those old vandals and confederates of the jerry-builder the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. They are always alienating some piece of land or are favouring the builders as opposed to the general public. The Commissioners would not sell the Churchyard Bottom wood to the ratepayers but now propose 'to open it up' by cutting two wide roads through it in connection with one of their numerous building schemes. Will not someone ask a question in Parliament and check the brick and mortar policy of the Commissioners?'<br/><br/>By the time this was printed, the question had been asked and the answer was either untrue, or devious. Other papers took up the story. The Times, in a long report, said that the Comnussioners were not prepared to give an undertaking that Parliament, or any other public body, should have an opportunity of considering any scheme for building on the site of the wood.<br/><br/>The situation simmered for eighteen months until the Ecclesiastical Commissioners were forced to open an enquiry, which began at Highgate on 31 May 1895, chaired by an Assistant Ecclesiastical Commissioner. The Inquiry produced a flurry of newspaper letters of which this was the most important.<br/><br/>The Daily Chronicle, 5 June 1895<br/><br/>VANDALISM AT HIGHGATE<br/><br/>Sir –<br/><br/>One of the most lovely bits of woodland in suburan London is threatened. Will you help us to ward off what would be a calamity, not only to the immediate district, but to the whole of densely-populated North London? In no part of the metropolis has the builder been more active than in Crouch End and Hornsey. The beautiful meadows of a year or two ago are now houses and shops. Ballast heaps have taken the place of stately elms and chestnuts, and once pleasant villages are sharing the fate of Stroud Green, Harringay, Finsbury Park, Highbury and Islington. ---<br/><br/>---- The object is the construction of two forty-foot roads through the woods. We in this district know the meaning of forty-foot roads through woods. It means that the woods are doomed. Ten years ago agitation saved the sister-wood of sixty-five acres - The Gravel Pit Woods - and no one who saw the Bank Holiday crowds flocking up the Archway Road from the dreary streets of Holloway, Islington and Clerkenwell, and watched the keen enjoyment of the children and family parties picnicking on the grass and among the trees, could fail to realise the immense boon that the grant by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners of this wood has been to the whole of North London, but the Lower Wood of sixty acres has always been regarded as a natural complement of the other. ----<br/><br/>--- The Ecclesiastical Commissioners own nearly one-third of the large parish of Hornsey. By the liberal expenditure of the ratepayers' money in the opening up of roads and the general development of the district, the value of their property has been enormously increased, and from this unearned increment they each year draw large revenues. Surely the ratepayers whose money has thus aided in creating the immense estate may expect liberal treatment in return. ---<br/><br/>Yours obediently,<br/><br/>Signed by The Vicar of St James', Muswell Hill, the Minister of Park Chapel, Crouch End, a barrister living in Onslow Gardens and three members of the District Council.<br/><br/>It was a shot right across the bows of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. Their own religious leaders and the District Council, all up in arms saying in effect that the church was too rich and should be charitable, not greedy. The inclusion of the two clergymen was a shrewd move. Remember to that this was still in the height of the Darwin controversy. Darwin had split belief in the teachings of the Church and many people would have resented the power of the Church from that point of view alone. The Church was not so secure as it pretended to be.<br/><br/>The Evening News, 7 June 1895 said:-<br/><br/>"If the Ecclesiastical Comnussioners are not tackled at once, the building octopus will get a grip of the wood which will be very difficult to loosen later on, ---. Therefore it behoves Londoners to be up and doing if they would save one of their most delightful bits of rustic scenery. The public inquiry stands adjourned to Thursday next, and before then something must be done to convince the Commissioners that the citizens of London will not tolerate the confiscation of one of their favourite playgrounds."<br/><br/>A letter in the Daily Chronicle the next day said:-<br/><br/>.... It was with great relief that that the residents, some ten years ago, heard that the purchase of the Upper Wood had been effected; and how delightful a boon this has proved, anyone who visited them can testify, but all who exerted themselves to save these upper woods, which lie on the west side of Muswell Hill road, felt that their victory was incomplete so long as the sixty acres on the east side remained in danger. It is, as it were, an accident that the woods are divided by a broad high road. Can anyone doubt what the effect would be if the Churchyard Bottom Wood were replaced by rows of small villas, each sending out its contribution of smoke and soot? Can anyone doubt, too, the serious difference it would make to the picturesque setting of the purchased woods if a line of staring new houses were to be run up right over against their leafy frontage?'<br/><br/>This expressed the opinions of many people. In fact, the Gravel Pit Wood, which the writer calls the 'Upper Wood', had not been purchased, but given to the district by the Ecclesiastical Commission, a point they were to reiterate time and again over the years, but most people ignored it. The Commission was not going to give away a second wood whatever anyone said, and held this position to the end.<br/><br/>H.S.Chamberlain, of 5 Cranley Gardens,<br/>in a letter to the Times dated June 8, 1895, urged purchase.<br/><br/>I know that it is common to speak harshly of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, but as the trustees of a fund they are bound to administer it to the greatest advantage, and therefore, if anything is to be done to save the demolition of the wood, it appears to me that it can only be effected by the purchase of the property from the Comnussioners, who I know, are fully alive to the protection of free and open spaces for the people, and who, I feel sure, would be disposed to treat the matter of a purchase in a free and liberal spirit, as they have already done in the matter of the Shepherd's Cot-field, by granting a lease to the Crouch End Playing-fields Company - a small company in which I own a few shares, a small company which was formed exclusively for the purpose of securing the fields for cricket, tennis etc.<br/><br/>(This refers the the Crouch End Playing Fields which had been secured a few years later.)<br/><br/>As Chairman of the Muswell Hill Conservative Association, I am constantly in touch with the inhabitants, and I can safely affirm that every person resident in the neighbourhood would do anything in reason to preserve.<br/><br/>(All he wanted personally was Charity income to support his poor people. He demanded his acre of land - not a great deal surely - he believed the Commissioners' assurance that the wood was not in danger.)<br/><br/>' Muswell Hill Road was one of the best in Hornsey and would remain equally beautiful, houses or no houses',<br/><br/>(and then came the great rhetorical flourish.)<br/><br/>'Are the poor to suffer because of the sentimental objections and the hysterical cry of 'wolf just raised by your correspondents? Something must be done and that soon. An acre of back-land added to the charity-estate would make no apprec­iable difference to the land remaining, while the profit derived from it would succour many poor old and deserving persons in their declining years and enable us to hand over to our successors an estate which in the distant future would be of great value in the rendering of charitable aid to the deserving poor of the parish of Hornsey.'<br/><br/>Reading his letter one senses hysteria very near the surface. Why did he think the Commissioners wanted to build a road? Why should they spend all that money if not to build houses? He never seemed to realise that for an acre of land the the whole wood would be lost. But he had been with the problem for a long time. He was the person to whom the Commissioners had made the offer of sale for £25,000 years before and it is his name which is honoured in a plaque on Crouch End Clock Tower for saving the wood, but his trust in the Ecclesiastical Commissioners seems naive. It is sad that at the Inquiry he was to be cast as the devil.<br/><br/>The Inquiry Continued<br/><br/>The adjourned opened in Highgate on 15 June 1895. Expecting a large gather­ing, the Council Chamber had been changed completely. The usual tables had been removed and the room filled with chairs. By half past seven the room was crowded, with people jostling for seats.<br/><br/>Mr Murray, the Commissioner, said the Inquiry was really a simple one. Hornsey Parochial Charities wished to purchase a piece of land adjoining their charity property at the back. The question was whether the Charity Commission, which controlled all charities, had enough power to stop them. The Church Commissioners were prepared to sell the land at very favourable terms and the income of the Charity would be very considerable increased.<br/><br/>Against this there were three classes of objection.<br/><br/>The original Trust was for the purpose of providing cottages for the Poor, but the trustees were proposing to build villas which would be too expensive for the Poor. However, it was within the power of the Trustees to vary the terms of the Trust, so they could build villas if they thought that the Poor would benefit in the end. The poor people themselves might object, but liberal provisions had already been promised for them. The third objection related to the aesthetic and public side of the question. He took it from what he had read that the Charity Commission ought to interfere to prevent the Ecclesiastical Commissioners from exercising their own discretion in dealing with their own property.<br/><br/>The Inquiry discussed fine points, but the speakers kept coming back to the major problem of preventing any destruction of the wood. The Vestry Clerk of Islington, representing 300,000 people, made a formal protest about any part of the wood, so valuable for the people of Islington and Hornsey being used for private purposes. Mr Wilfred White said that if the Commissioners would give them time they would be able to raise the money to compensate the Trustees.<br/><br/>Mr Beaumont said they did not want villas, they wanted cottages for poor people who were being driven out of the district. Others said that there was no money to build cottages to replace the present delapidated ones but villas would be an economic proposition. Others retorted that there were score of villas to let in Highgate. The Wood was sacred. Stick to the question of the Wood.<br/><br/>Dr Fletcher said the cry among the working people was that there was nowhere to go. Working people came to him with the cry, "We are driven out of Highgate and are obliged to go to Highgate New Town." If the Muswell Hill Road frontage was sold there was no question but that roads might be cut right through the woods in the direction of Hornsey, but if the Commissioners could not get the land from the Charity Commission they could not cut the road.<br/><br/>He was very sure the cottages could be put into a fit state of repair. He was asked by the poor people, by the police and by a number of the working classes to represent these two points, that cottage accommodation was very sorely needed in Highgate and that if they once allowed the land to be sold, there was no telling where the hand of the builder would be stayed.<br/><br/>(Loud and prolonged cheers).<br/><br/>Numerous other people spoke and the Comnussioner summed up by saying that he took it that the prevailing opinion was in favour of retaining the cottages but the meeting should draw no conclusions from what he had said (Groans).<br/><br/>Others said that the Trustees of the Charity had failed in their duties by letting the the cottages fall into disrepair.<br/><br/>Mr H.R.Williams, the Trustee who had written to the paper earlier, said that he had it on the best authority that the Church Commissioners would make no roads whatever and they would not be benefitted one iota by the actions of the Charity Commissioners. Others were far less trusting and the meeting closed after nearly three hours.<br/><br/>'We are faced with the fact that in Highgate and Muswell Hill there are a number of persons who want the Churchyard Bottom Wood and will not be happy until they have got it - while nobody appears willing to spend a farthing to pay for it. Everyone says it would be a fine thing to have the wood as open space, but everybody thinks it is the duty of someone else to make it one. The Islington Vestry has 'resolved' on the subject, but the Islington Vestry does not offer a penny piece towards the purchase. --- There is no more difficult problem for the community or the individual to solve than how to gain possession of other people's property without paying for it.'<br/><br/>Paying for it was indeed the problem as Churchyard Bottom Wood became the subject of intense local and national debate. A joint committee was formed to raise money to save the wood. On 20 November 1896, C.F.Cory-Wright, Hon Treasurer, wrote to The Standard, a daily paper at that time, appealing for help. He reminded everyone of the danger of losing the wood and said it could only be saved by buying it. The Church Commissioners would sell for £25,000 and an extra (5,000 would be required for fencing and drainage, making a total of £30,000. This was too much for Hornsey Council to raise but they had already voted £10,000 towards the total. The woods were of inestimable value to all of North London so he appealed to public bodies and private people to raise the remaining £20,000. He warned that the present offer from the Church Commissioners was open only to the end of 1898. After that the builders would move in.<br/><br/>The appeal was warmly welcomed by the press. A Private Bill was rushed through Parliament and the Highgate Woods Preservation Act, 1897, became law. The Conunittee now had the right to advertise for contributions towards buying the Wood and preserving it.<br/><br/>In a fairly short time almost all the money was raised, but the last few thousand proved very difficult to raise and the Commissioners' deadline was a matter of weeks away. Mr Cory-Wright wrote pleading for more time but was granted a mere three months and then only if interest at 4 per cent was paid for the extra period on the full sum. In the end the London County Council, which had originally offered £2,500, made this up to £5,000 and the total was reached, but it was a close-run thing.<br/><br/>The Council decided to re-name the Wood as 'Queen's Woods' in honour of Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee and Hornsey put on a fine display of bunting when the Duchess of Albany formally declared the Wood open 'for the free use of the public for ever'.<br/><br/>While the campaign to save Churchyard Bottom Wood was run and directed by local people who felt passionately about this particular piece of woodland, they called on the help and experience of a vast network of people, some of whom had worked together on similar campaigns for over thirty years. The Committee issued an appeal, printed on very good quality paper and bearing some famous names.<br/><br/>The questions of open space and public health were major subjects of the Victorian vision.<br/><br/>The Open Spaces Movement<br/><br/>Octavia Hill, the great housing reformer, who had begun with three old houses in Marylebone, bought for her by Jolm Ruskin, had quickly become an expert on housing poor people in the healthiest conditions possible. Her way was to buy leases and then knock down some of the crowded houses in order to bring light and air to the rest, believing that fresh air and sunlight were the the only way poor people could be saved from 'putrid fever. She had learnt this as a child from her grandfather, Southwood Smith, who developed his theories at the Fever Hospital at King's Cross.<br/><br/>He had built the first Industrial Dwellings for poor people and had proved statistically that good air and decent drainage saved lives. Gibson Gardens, in Northwold Road, is a direct outcome of Southwood Smith's ideas. More Information on Gibson Gardens<br/><br/>The Importance of Open Air<br/><br/>Open spaces and the opportunity to breathe clean air, were essential for people living in one or two crowded rooms. Octavia Hill took her charges from the Lisson Grove slums, up Fitzjohn's Avenue to Hampstead Heath. She so loved the Fitzjohn's Avenue fields that she tried to buy them as a public park. They were to cost £10,000 and within three August weeks £8,500 had been raised. It needed only the end of the summer holidays and the return from holiday of sympathetic friends and the further £1,500 would have been raised, but the owners suddenly withdrew their offer. Despite all pleading, the fields were covered with large houses.<br/><br/>From this developed the campaign to save Parliament Hill, the next open space northwards from Lisson Grove, buying up fields in the path of the builders to make a permanent cordon sanitalre against the advancing bricks. The Parliament Hill Fields campaign was so successful that the Hampstead Heath Bill was passed and there was money over from the appeal. From this money and the impetus towards open spaces, was to develop the National Trust. Octavia Hill had been interested in protecting areas like Church Bottom Wood for years, so she was a natural ally in the fight to save the Wood.<br/><br/>The Commons Preservation Society also, was familiar with this kind of agitation and money collection. They had torn down fencing when lords of the manor had enclosed pieces of common land, leading both legal and illegal battles against the arrogant privatization of land traditionally free. Robert Hunter, their Honorary Solicitor from 1868, was always concerned with securing open spaces, large or small, for the public. He, now Sir Robert Hunter, became the Chairman of the Church Bottom Appeal. The Chairman of the Commons Preservation Society was Mr Shaw-Lefevre MP (later Lord Eversley) who played a big part in this and other campaigns in the House of Commons. Octavia Hill had been involved in their work from about 1875.<br/><br/>At the same time Octavia Hill was campaigning for a Burials Bill.<br/><br/>City churchyards had become so full and such a serious a hazard to health, by contaminating wells from which people drew their drinking water, that City burials were no longer permitted. Instead, cemetries were created on the outskirts of town. Abney Park Cemetary was one of these. There was then a movement to remove the headstones to the edges of the old town cemetries, re-inter the bodies elsewhere and turn the cemetries into gardens and open spaces, instead of building on them. This land in the centre of London was very valuable and speculators were avid to obtain it: Even the Quakers had built over one of their cemetries and threatened to do so again by building over Bunhill Fields. Octavia Hill had a network of allies in a dozen fields, so her help to save the Church Bottom Wood must have been invaluable.<br/><br/>The Metropolitan Gardens Society, set up in 1882, had laid out about two hundred small gardens in city centres by 1890. They later handed them over to the Local Authorities, so their support for the Churchyard Bottom Wood Appeal was assured from the start.<br/><br/>The Kyrle Society is forgotten now, but in its day had great influence on Town Planning and Open Space legislation. The Society had been set up about 1875 for 'the Diffusion of Beauty', to bring colour and interest into the lives of people living in dull, drab surroundings. Bright colour to walls and decoration, good singing, open spaces, Nature, Literature and Art. All these fell within the Society's remit. There was a Decorative Branch, for whom William Morris lectured; a Musical Branch to promote choirs and Happy Evenings for people in local school buildings; and a Literature Branch. The Society appealed regularly by letters in The Times, to 'the richer classes' for books and periodicals to be distributed to boys' and girls' clubs, almshouses and elsewhere. However the Open Spaces Committee was the most active. The very name 'Kyrle' came from Pope's The Man of Ross, the philanthropist who gave his birthplace to the people as a public park. | Madera de fondo Churchyard<br/><br/>Highgate<br/><br/>Madera de fondo Churchyard, Highgate<br/><br/>Ahora se llama Queen's Wood<br/><br/>Entre 1860 y 1880 el centro fue arrancado de la City de Londres para construir alcantarillas, ferrocarriles y nuevas carreteras. Las casas fueron demolidas sin tener en cuenta a los inquilinos que tenían que encontrar cualquier alojamiento que pudieran en otro lugar. Los gerentes fueron a Livo en Kensington y St. John's Wood, mientras que los más pobres se apiñaron en las colonias como Seven Dials y Lisson Grove. Para aquellos entre los empleados y trabajadores calificados, los constructores especulativos pusieron fila tras fila de villas adosadas y el Sr. Pooter se mudó a Holloway. La gente de Muswell Hill vio casas arrastrarse a través de los campos de Finsbury Park, hasta Crouch Hill y por el otro lado, por lo que en 1880, Crouch End se estaba desarrollando y no parecía haber manera de detener el flujo. Diez años más tarde, las grandes propiedades de Muswell Hill estaban siendo vendidas. Upton Farm fue vendida y los Comisionados Eclesiásticos querían desarrollar Churchyard Bottom Wood, ahora llamado Queen's Wood. La historia habría hecho una obra de Ibsen. Dos grupos de personas honestas y altamente motivadas que luchan por lo que cada uno pensaba que era correcto. Los Comisarios Eclesiásticos por un lado y el Comité de las Caridades Hornsey por el otro, ambos creían que estaban haciendo lo mejor para otras personas, y el público se levantó contra ellos con indignación.<br/><br/>En ese momento Muswell Hill Road era una carretera rural, con Southwood Hall en un extremo y Upton Farm en el otro. En 1894, se construyeron Onslow Gardens, Connaught Gardens marcado, y los constructores estaban a punto de desarrollar la finca Woodlands. Cortado de Churchyard Bottom Wood había un grupo de cabañas derrumbadas, en un sitio triangular. Un mapa sin fecha, sostenido por los Comisionados Eclesiásticos, muestra seis cabañas de Wasteland con una abertura entre ellas, no un camino, no metalizado, sino un camino a través de los lechos de fresas detrás. Más adelante había otra brecha que conducía a senderos a través de la madera. Estas dos aberturas debían ser la base del plan. Las mismas dos brechas y el terreno despejado, que era el campo de fresas, se pueden ver en el mapa de 1894 a continuación. Se muestran como 'Muswell Hill Cottages' y, de paso, Peter Sellers iba a vivir en el mismo sitio mucho más tarde. Para desarrollar la madera como una urbanización, los comisionados necesitaban conducir dos caminos desde Muswell Hill Road y construir casas a lo largo de ellos. La fachada de Muswell Hill Road por sí sola no habría proporcionado espacio para suficientes casas para que la empresa valiera la pena.<br/><br/>La tierra y las cabañas se habían dado mucho antes como casas de limosna para albergar a los ancianos y fueron retenidas en su nombre por los Fideicomisarios de los Comisionados de Caridad de Hornsey. De espíritu público, deseando hacer lo mejor por sus antiguos inquilinos, los Fideicomisarios no podían mejorarlos ya que no tenían dinero. Algunos años antes los Comisionados Eclesiásticos habían planeado desarrollar Gravel Pit Wood (ahora Highgate Wood) como una urbanización, pero esto había encontrado tal oposición que retrocedieron. En su lugar, en 1886, dieron los 69 acres de bosque al público. Al mismo tiempo, ofrecieron vender Churchyard Bottom Wood al Consejo del Distrito Urbano de Hornsey por 25.000 libras, pero esto era demasiado para que Hornsey lo recaudara por sí solo. El Consejo dijo que las personas que vivían fuera de Hornsey también disfrutaban de la madera y que otras autoridades deberían ayudar, pero no se les dio ayuda.<br/><br/>Mapa que muestra las cabañas de Muswell Hill que fueron el centro de la controversia.<br/><br/>Muswell Hill Road alrededor de 1880<br/><br/>Parece probable que estos tres pares de cabañas fueran los que estaban en el centro de la disputa.<br/><br/>Los Comisionados Eclesiásticos querían recaudar dinero para su trabajo de iglesia en Gran Bretaña y en el extranjero. Consideraron que se les había dado la tierra para ser utilizada para la propaganda de la religión y si esto significaba vender tierras o bosques, era un mal menor que restringir el trabajo de la iglesia. Habían dado Gravel Pit Wood al público: en su lugar desarrollarían Churchyard Bottom Wood.<br/><br/>Los fideicomisarios de las Caridades Hornsey querían producir un ingreso para ayudar a sus pobres, por lo que hicieron una oferta a los Comisionados. Su terreno triangular tenía una forma demasiado incómoda para desarrollarse económicamente, pero si los comisionados les otorgaban más tierra para convertirlo en un sitio cuadrado, construirían veinticinco villas ordenadas. En cambio, permitirían a los miembros de la Comisión cortar dos carreteras a través de sus tierras para que los Comisarios pudieran desarrollar el bosque.<br/><br/>Cuando esta oferta se hizo conocida, la gente reaccionó inmediatamente con alarma.<br/><br/>El 16 de diciembre de 1893 el Sr. Carvell Williams MP preguntó en la Cámara de los Comunes, si los Comisarios Eclesiásticos habían consentido en vender una franja de tierra a los Fideicomisarios de Caridades de Hornsey a condición de que un camino existente se ensanchara a 40 pies, si esto era un preliminar a un esquema de construcción y si la Cámara del Parlamento tendría una oportunidad de expresar una opinión.<br/><br/>El Sr. Leveson Gower, un Comisionado de Church Estates respondió: "Sí" a la primera parte.<br/><br/>Carvell Williams, "¿Entiendo que es la intención de destruir esa parte de Highgate Woods construyendo sobre ella?"<br/><br/>Dos días después The Star publicó un artículo digno de cualquier tabloide moderno.<br/><br/>La estrella<br/>18 de diciembre de 1893<br/><br/>«El Parlamento debe vigilar atentamente a los antiguos vándalos y cómplices de los Comisarios eclesiásticos, que siempre están enajenando algún terreno o favoreciendo a los constructores frente al público en general. Los Comisarios no venderían la madera de Churchyard Bottom a los contribuyentes, pero ahora proponen "abrirla" cortando dos carreteras anchas a través de ella en relación con uno de sus numerosos esquemas de construcción. ¿No hará alguien una pregunta en el Parlamento y comprobará la política de los Comisarios?<br/><br/>En el momento en que esto se imprimió, la pregunta se había hecho y la respuesta era falsa o tortuosa. Otros periódicos retomaron la historia. El Times, en un largo informe, dijo que los Comnussioners no estaban dispuestos a comprometerse a que el Parlamento, o cualquier otro organismo público, tuviera la oportunidad de considerar cualquier plan para construir en el sitio de la madera.<br/><br/>La situación coció a fuego lento durante dieciocho meses hasta que los Comisionados Eclesiásticos se vieron obligados a abrir una investigación, que comenzó en Highgate el 31 de mayo de 1895, presidida por un Comisionado Eclesiástico Adjunto. La Investigación produjo una ráfaga de cartas de periódico de las cuales esto era el más importante.<br/><br/>The Daily Chronicle, 5 de junio de 1895<br/><br/>VANDALISMO EN ALTA GATE<br/><br/>Señor -<br/><br/>Uno de los más bellos trozos de bosque en el suburan de Londres está amenazado. ¿Nos ayudará a evitar lo que sería una calamidad, no solo para el distrito inmediato, sino para todo el densamente poblado norte de Londres? En ninguna parte de la metrópolis el constructor ha sido más activo que en Crouch End y Hornsey. Los hermosos prados de hace un año o dos son ahora casas y tiendas. Montones de lastre han tomado el lugar de majestuosos olmos y castañas, y una vez agradables aldeas están compartiendo el destino de Stroud Green, Harringay, Finsbury Park, Highbury e Islington.<br/><br/>---- El objeto es la construcción de dos caminos de cuarenta pies a través del bosque. Nosotros en este distrito conocemos el significado de caminos de cuarenta pies a través del bosque. Significa que el bosque está condenado. Hace diez años, la agitación salvó el bosque hermano de sesenta y cinco acres, el Gravel Pit Woods, y nadie que haya visto a las multitudes de Bank Holiday subir en masa por Archway Road desde las sombrías calles de Holloway, Islington y Clerkenwell, y haya visto el agudo disfrute de los niños y las fiestas familiares que hacen picnic en la hierba y entre los árboles, siempre podría dejar de darse cuenta de la inmensa bendición que la concesión de los comisionados eclesiásticos de este bosque. ----<br/><br/>--- Los Comisionados Eclesiásticos poseen casi un tercio de la gran parroquia de Hornsey. Por el gasto liberal del dinero de los contribuyentes en la apertura de las carreteras y el desarrollo general del distrito, el valor de su propiedad se ha incrementado enormemente, y de este incremento no ganado cada año obtienen grandes ingresos. Seguramente los contribuyentes cuyo dinero ha ayudado a crear el inmenso patrimonio pueden esperar un tratamiento liberal a cambio.<br/><br/>Vuestra obediencia,<br/><br/>Firmado por el Vicario de St James, Muswell Hill, el Ministro de Park Chapel, Crouch End, un abogado que vive en Onslow Gardens y tres miembros del Consejo de Distrito.<br/><br/>Fue un disparo a través de los arcos de los Comisionados Eclesiásticos. Sus propios líderes religiosos y el Consejo de Distrito, todos en armas, diciendo en efecto que la iglesia era demasiado rica y debía ser caritativa, no codiciosa. La inclusión de los dos clérigos fue un movimiento astuto. Recuerde que esto todavía estaba en el apogeo de la controversia de Darwin. Darwin había dividido la creencia en las enseñanzas de la Iglesia y muchas personas habrían resentido el poder de la Iglesia desde ese punto de vista solamente. La Iglesia no era tan segura como pretendía ser.<br/><br/>The Evening News, 7 de junio de 1895 dijo:<br/><br/>"Si los Comunicadores Eclesiásticos no son atacados de inmediato, el pulpo del edificio obtendrá un agarre de la madera que será muy difícil de aflojar más adelante, ---. Por lo tanto, corresponde a los londinenses estar despiertos y haciendo si quieren salvar uno de sus más deliciosos pedacitos de paisaje rústico. La investigación pública se suspende hasta el jueves siguiente, y antes de eso hay que hacer algo para convencer a los comisarios de que los ciudadanos de Londres no tolerarán la confiscación de uno de sus parques infantiles favoritos.<br/><br/>Una carta en el Daily Chronicle al día siguiente dijo:<br/><br/>.... Fue con gran alivio que los residentes, hace unos diez años, se enteraron de que la compra del Bosque Superior se había efectuado; y cuán delicioso ha demostrado esto, cualquiera que los visitara puede testificar, pero todos los que se esforzaron por salvar estos bosques superiores, que se encuentran en el lado oeste de la carretera de Muswell Hill, sintieron que su victoria era incompleta mientras los sesenta acres en el lado este permanecieran en peligro. Es, por así decirlo, un accidente que los bosques estén divididos por un amplio camino alto. ¿Puede alguien dudar de cuál sería el efecto si el Bosque Inferior del Patio de la Iglesia fuera reemplazado por filas de pequeñas villas, cada una enviando su contribución de humo y hollín? ¿Puede alguien dudar, también, de la seria diferencia que haría para el pintoresco entorno de los bosques comprados si una línea de nuevas casas fijas fueran atropelladas contra su frondosa fachada?<br/><br/>Esto expresaba las opiniones de muchas personas. De hecho, el Gravel Pit Wood, que el escritor llama el 'Upper Wood', no había sido comprado, sino dado al distrito por la Comisión Eclesiástica, un punto que debían reiterar una y otra vez a lo largo de los años, pero la mayoría de la gente lo ignoró. La Comisión no iba a regalar una segunda madera, lo que nadie dijo, y mantuvo esta posición hasta el final.<br/><br/>H.S. Chamberlain, de 5 Cranley Gardens, en una carta al Times fechada el 8 de junio de 1895, instó a la compra.<br/><br/>Sé que es común hablar con dureza de los Comisarios eclesiásticos, pero como los fideicomisarios de un fondo que están obligados a administrar con la mayor ventaja, y por lo tanto, si algo se va a hacer para salvar la demolición de la madera, me parece que sólo se puede efectuar mediante la compra de la propiedad de los Comnussioners, que sé, están plenamente vivos para la protección de los espacios libres y abiertos para el pueblo.<br/><br/>(Esto se refiere a los Campos de Juego Crouch End que se habían asegurado unos años más tarde).<br/><br/>Como presidente de la Asociación Conservadora de Muswell Hill, estoy constantemente en contacto con los habitantes, y puedo afirmar con seguridad que cada persona residente en el vecindario haría cualquier cosa para preservar.<br/><br/>(Todo lo que quería personalmente era ingresos de caridad para mantener a su pobre pueblo, y exigió su acre de tierra -no mucho seguro- creía que la garantía de los comisionados de que la madera no estaba en peligro.)<br/><br/>Muswell Hill Road era una de las mejores de Hornsey y seguiría siendo igualmente hermosa, casas o no casas.<br/><br/>(Y luego vino el gran florecimiento retórico.)<br/><br/>¿Sufrirán los pobres a causa de las objeciones sentimentales y el grito histérico de lobo que acaban de levantar sus corresponsales? Un acre de tierra de fondo añadido a la caridad-estado no haría ninguna diferencia apreciable a la tierra restante, mientras que el beneficio derivado de ella ayudaría a muchos pobres ancianos y merecedores de personas en sus años de declive y nos permiten entregar a nuestros sucesores una finca que en un futuro lejano sería de gran valor en la prestación de ayuda caritativa a los pobres merecedores de la parroquia de Hornsey.<br/><br/>Leyendo su carta uno siente la histeria muy cerca de la superficie. ¿Por qué pensó que los Comisarios querían construir una carretera? ¿Por qué deberían gastar todo ese dinero si no para construir casas? Nunca pareció darse cuenta de que por un acre de tierra se perdería todo el bosque, pero había estado con el problema durante mucho tiempo. Era la persona a quien los comisarios habían hecho la oferta de venta por 25.000 años antes y es su nombre el que se honra en una placa en la Torre del Reloj de Crouch End por salvar la madera, pero su confianza en los comisarios eclesiásticos parece ingenua. Es triste que en la investigación fuera lanzado como el diablo.<br/><br/>La investigación continuó<br/><br/>La sesión se abrió en Highgate el 15 de junio de 1895. Esperando una gran reunión, el Salón del Consejo se había cambiado por completo. Se habían retirado las mesas habituales y la sala se había llenado de sillas. A las siete y media la habitación estaba abarrotada, con la gente empujándose por los asientos.<br/><br/>El Sr. Murray, el Comisario, dijo que la investigación era realmente sencilla y que Hornsey Parochial Charities deseaba comprar un terreno contiguo a su propiedad de caridad en la parte posterior. La pregunta era si la Comisión de Caridad, que controlaba todas las organizaciones benéficas, tenía suficiente poder para detenerlas. Los Comisionados de la Iglesia estaban dispuestos a vender la tierra en términos muy favorables y los ingresos de la Caridad se incrementarían considerablemente.<br/><br/>Contra esto había tres clases de objeciones.<br/><br/>El Fideicomiso original tenía el propósito de proporcionar cabañas para los pobres, pero los fideicomisarios proponían construir villas que serían demasiado caras para los pobres. Sin embargo, estaba dentro del poder de los Fideicomisarios variar los términos del Fideicomiso, para que pudieran construir villas si pensaban que los pobres se beneficiarían al final. Los propios pobres podrían objetar, pero ya se les habían prometido disposiciones liberales; la tercera objeción se refería a la parte estética y pública de la cuestión. Lo tomó de lo que había leído que la Comisión de Caridad debería interferir para evitar que los Comisionados Eclesiásticos ejerzan su propia discreción al tratar con su propia propiedad.<br/><br/>La investigación discutió los puntos finos, pero los oradores siguieron volviendo al problema principal de evitar cualquier destrucción de la madera. El secretario de la Iglesia de Islington, que representa a 300.000 personas, hizo una protesta formal sobre cualquier parte de la madera, tan valiosa para la gente de Islington y Hornsey que se utiliza para fines privados. El Sr. Wilfred White dijo que si los Comisarios les dieran tiempo, podrían recaudar el dinero para compensar a los Fideicomisarios.<br/><br/>Beaumont dijo que no querían villas, querían casas de campo para personas pobres que estaban siendo expulsadas del distrito. Otros dijeron que no había dinero para construir casas de campo para reemplazar a los actuales desapacibles, pero que las villas serían una propuesta económica. Otros replicaron que había decenas de villas para dejar entrar a Highgate. El bosque era sagrado. Cíñete a la cuestión de la madera.<br/><br/>El Dr. Fletcher dijo que el grito entre los trabajadores era que no había a dónde ir, y que los trabajadores se le acercaron con el grito: "Nos expulsan de Highgate y nos obligan a ir a Highgate New Town". Si la fachada de Muswell Hill Road se vendía, no había duda de que las carreteras podrían cortarse a través del bosque en dirección a Hornsey, pero si los comisionados no podían obtener la tierra de la Comisión de Caridad, no podían cortar la carretera.<br/><br/>Estaba muy seguro de que las cabañas podrían ponerse en un estado de reparación adecuado. La gente pobre, la policía y varias clases trabajadoras le pidieron que representara estos dos puntos, que el alojamiento en casas rurales era muy necesario en Highgate y que si una vez permitían que se vendiera la tierra, no se sabía dónde se alojaría la mano del constructor.<br/><br/>(Grandes y prolongados aplausos).<br/><br/>Muchas otras personas hablaron y el Comnussioner resumió diciendo que él entendía que la opinión predominante era a favor de retener las cabañas, pero la reunión no debería sacar conclusiones de lo que había dicho (Groans).<br/><br/>Otros dijeron que los Fideicomisarios de la Caridad habían fallado en sus deberes al dejar que las cabañas cayeran en mal estado.<br/><br/>El Sr. H.R. Williams, el Fideicomisario que había escrito al periódico anteriormente, dijo que tenía la mejor autoridad para que los Comisionados de la Iglesia no hicieran ningún camino y que no se beneficiarían ni un ápice por las acciones de los Comisionados de Caridad. Otros fueron mucho menos confiados y la reunión se cerró después de casi tres horas.<br/><br/>“Nos enfrentamos con el hecho de que en Highgate y Muswell Hill hay un número de personas que quieren el Churchyard Bottom Wood y no serán felices hasta que lo hayan conseguido, mientras que nadie parece dispuesto a gastar un centavo para pagarlo. Todo el mundo dice que sería una buena cosa tener la madera como espacio abierto, pero todo el mundo piensa que es el deber de otra persona para que sea uno. La Islington Vestry se ha "resuelto" sobre el tema, pero la Islington Vestry no ofrece una pieza de un centavo para la compra. No hay problema más difícil de resolver para la comunidad o el individuo que cómo obtener la posesión de los bienes de otras personas sin pagar por ello.<br/><br/>Pagar por ello fue de hecho el problema, ya que Churchyard Bottom Wood se convirtió en el tema de un intenso debate local y nacional. Se formó un comité conjunto para recaudar dinero para salvar la madera. El 20 de noviembre de 1896, C.F. Cory-Wright, el Tesorero Hon, escribió a The Standard, un diario en ese momento, pidiendo ayuda. Recordó a todos el peligro de perder la madera y dijo que solo se podía salvar comprándola. Los comisionados de la Iglesia se venderían por 25.000 libras esterlinas y un extra (5.000 serían necesarios para la esgrima y el drenaje, lo que supondría un total de 30.000 libras esterlinas, lo que era demasiado para que el Consejo de Hornsey lo recaudara, pero ya habían votado 10.000 libras esterlinas hacia el total. Los bosques eran de inestimable valor para todo el norte de Londres, por lo que hizo un llamamiento a los organismos públicos y a las personas privadas para que recaudaran los 20.000 euros restantes, advirtiendo que la oferta actual de los comisionados de la Iglesia estaba abierta solo hasta finales de 1898. Después de eso, los constructores se mudaron.<br/><br/>La apelación fue bien recibida por la prensa. Un proyecto de ley privado fue apresurado a través del Parlamento y la Ley de Preservación de los Bosques de Highgate, 1897, se convirtió en ley. El Consejo ahora tenía el derecho de publicitar contribuciones para comprar la madera y preservarla.<br/><br/>En un tiempo bastante corto se recaudó casi todo el dinero, pero los últimos miles resultaron muy difíciles de recaudar y el plazo de los Comisarios era cuestión de semanas. Cory-Wright escribió suplicando por más tiempo, pero se le concedió solo tres meses y luego solo si se pagaban intereses al 4 por ciento por el período adicional sobre la suma total. Al final, el Consejo del Condado de Londres, que originalmente había ofrecido 2.500 libras esterlinas, hizo esto hasta 5.000 libras esterlinas y se alcanzó el total, pero fue algo cercano.<br/><br/>El Consejo decidió cambiar el nombre de la madera como "Bosques de la Reina" en honor al Jubileo de Diamante de la reina Victoria y Hornsey puso en una fina exhibición de bunting cuando la duquesa de Albany declaró formalmente el bosque abierto "para el uso libre del público para siempre".<br/><br/>Si bien la campaña para salvar Churchyard Bottom Wood fue dirigida por personas locales que sentían pasión por este pedazo de bosque en particular, recurrieron a la ayuda y la experiencia de una vasta red de personas, algunas de las cuales habían trabajado juntas en campañas similares durante más de treinta años. El Comité emitió un llamamiento, impreso en papel de muy buena calidad y con algunos nombres famosos.<br/><br/>Las cuestiones del espacio abierto y la salud pública fueron los temas principales de la visión victoriana.<br/><br/>El movimiento de los espacios abiertos<br/><br/>Octavia Hill, la gran reformadora de viviendas, que había comenzado con tres casas antiguas en Marylebone, compradas para ella por Jolm Ruskin, se había convertido rápidamente en una experta en alojar a personas pobres en las condiciones más saludables posibles. Su manera era comprar arrendamientos y luego derribar algunas de las casas abarrotadas para traer luz y aire al resto, creyendo que el aire fresco y la luz solar eran la única forma en que las personas pobres podían salvarse de la fiebre putrefacta. Ella había aprendido esto cuando era niña de su abuelo, Southwood Smith, quien desarrolló sus teorías en el Hospital de Fiebre en King's Cross.<br/><br/>Había construido las primeras viviendas industriales para los pobres y había demostrado estadísticamente que el buen aire y el drenaje decente salvaron vidas. Gibson Gardens, en Northwold Road, es un resultado directo de las ideas de Southwood Smith. Más información sobre Gibson Gardens<br/><br/>La importancia del aire libre<br/><br/>Los espacios abiertos y la oportunidad de respirar aire limpio eran esenciales para las personas que vivían en una o dos habitaciones abarrotadas. Octavia Hill tomó sus cargos desde los barrios pobres de Lisson Grove, hasta la avenida Fitzjohn hasta Hampstead Heath. Le encantaban tanto los campos de Fitzjohn's Avenue que intentó comprarlos como parque público, que costarían 10.000 libras y en tres semanas de agosto se habían recaudado 8.500 libras. Solo se necesitaría el final de las vacaciones de verano y el regreso de amigos comprensivos y las 1.500 libras adicionales que se habrían recaudado, pero los propietarios de repente retiraron su oferta. A pesar de todas las súplicas, los campos estaban cubiertos de grandes casas.<br/><br/>A partir de esto se desarrolló la campaña para salvar Parliament Hill, el siguiente espacio abierto hacia el norte desde Lisson Grove, comprando campos en el camino de los constructores para hacer un cordón sanitario permanente contra los ladrillos que avanzaban. La campaña de Parliament Hill Fields tuvo tanto éxito que se aprobó el proyecto de ley de Hampstead Heath y hubo dinero de la apelación. De este dinero y el impulso hacia los espacios abiertos, se desarrolló el National Trust. Octavia Hill había estado interesada en proteger áreas como Church Bottom Wood durante años, por lo que fue una aliada natural en la lucha por salvar el bosque.<br/><br/>La Sociedad de Preservación de los Comunes también estaba familiarizada con este tipo de agitación y recolección de dinero. Habían derribado cercas cuando los señores de la mansión habían encerrado pedazos de tierra común, liderando batallas legales e ilegales contra la arrogante privatización de la tierra tradicionalmente libre. Robert Hunter, su Procurador Honorario de 1868, siempre se preocupó por asegurar espacios abiertos, grandes o pequeños, para el público. Él, ahora Sir Robert Hunter, se convirtió en el Presidente de la Iglesia Bottom Appeal. El presidente de la Sociedad de Preservación de los Comunes fue el Sr. Shaw-Lefevre MP (más tarde Lord Eversley) que jugó un papel importante en esta y otras campañas en la Cámara de los Comunes.<br/><br/>Al mismo tiempo, Octavia Hill estaba haciendo campaña por un proyecto de ley de entierros.<br/><br/>Los cementerios de la ciudad se habían vuelto tan llenos y un peligro tan grave para la salud, al contaminar los pozos de los que la gente sacaba su agua potable, que los entierros de la ciudad ya no estaban permitidos. El Cementerio de Abney Park fue uno de ellos, y hubo un movimiento para quitar las lápidas a los bordes de los cementerios del casco antiguo, volver a interponer los cuerpos en otros lugares y convertir los cementerios en jardines y espacios abiertos, en lugar de construir sobre ellos. Esta tierra en el centro de Londres era muy valiosa y los especuladores estaban ávidos de obtenerla: incluso los cuáqueros habían construido sobre uno de sus cementerios y amenazaron con hacerlo de nuevo construyendo sobre Bunhill Fields. Octavia Hill tenía una red de aliados en una docena de campos, por lo que su ayuda para salvar el Bosque Inferior de la Iglesia debe haber sido invaluable.<br/><br/>La Sociedad de Jardines Metropolitanos, creada en 1882, había establecido unos doscientos pequeños jardines en los centros de las ciudades en 1890, que más tarde se entregaron a las autoridades locales, por lo que su apoyo al Churchyard Bottom Wood Appeal se aseguró desde el principio.<br/><br/>La Sociedad Kyrle está olvidada ahora, pero en su día tuvo una gran influencia en la planificación urbana y la legislación de espacio abierto. La Sociedad se había creado alrededor de 1875 para "la difusión de la belleza", para traer el color y el interés en la vida de las personas que viven en un entorno aburrido y monótono. Color brillante a las paredes y la decoración, buen canto, espacios abiertos, Naturaleza, Literatura y Arte. Había una Rama Decorativa, para quien William Morris dio una conferencia; una Rama Musical para promover coros y Noches Felices para la gente en los edificios escolares locales; y una Rama de Literatura. La Sociedad apeló regularmente por cartas en The Times, a 'las clases más ricas' para libros y publicaciones periódicas para distribuirse a clubes de muchachos y muchachas, casas de la limosna y en otra parte. El mismo nombre "Kyrle" vino de El hombre de Ross de Pope, el filántropo que dio su lugar de nacimiento a la gente como un parque público. |
| With Thanksgiving around the corner, here are some festive file folder games we made for the girls. Both Thanksgiving games focus on math skills. And I'm grateful once again to my husband, Ed, for making all the clipart for me.<br/><br/>Thanksgiving Pattern Making<br/><br/>Like the name says, this game is about making patterns. Little ones just learning about patterns, can simply match the pictures onto the pattern strips, while others can continue the pattern with the picture cards on the blank strips.<br/><br/>To make the file folder, you want to cut out the grid of pictures to make the card pieces. I recommend laminating them to help them last longer. Then glue the pattern strips down on the file folder.<br/><br/>I wanted to have the blank pattern strips too so that the girls could see where to continue the pattern and how many to lay out. I attached them to the side of the folder using tape so that they could fold in to pack up the game and extend to layout the pattern.<br/><br/>I also added an extra blank one so that the girls could make their own pattern as well.<br/><br/>Turkey Number Game<br/><br/>In this game the girls add the feathers to the turkey body while practicing counting and number recognition. I used the colorless feathers to act as a guide for where to add the feathers and so that the girls could match the numbers. And be sure when gluing down the turkey body you only glue in the center so that the wing pieces can slide under the body.<br/><br/>Once all the feathers are laid out, we practice some simple arithmetic, such as taking away three feathers and seeing how many are left then adding two back to see what it equals.<br/><br/>In addition to black and white wings, we also included a colorless turkey in case you want to have the little ones color their own set. Instead of a file folder game you can turn this into a craft, coloring the pieces, cutting them out, and gluing them together.<br/><br/>Another option is to use the pieces to make a felt board story. We sometimes sing a turkey version of 10 Little Indians:<br/><br/>Like this:<br/><br/>Who Am I?<br/><br/>I think this is where I'm suppose to say something witty about myself. Oh well. I'm a stay-at-home mom to three awesome kids--our twin daughters who are seven now and a two-year-old son who is full of energy. In my pre-children life I was a teacher and I now homeschool our children. I'm also married to Ed, who is currently serving in the Air Force, and is the love of my life (it'd be awkward if he wasn't). Our family is big on books, crafts, and having fun together. I just thought I would share our activities in my own little corner of the internet.<br/><br/>Zoe appears to have it all--rich, handsome husband, easy New York life--but she made mistakes in her past and those mistakes are coming back up in her new life. I found myself on the edge of my seat for most of the book and was surprised...<br/><br/>I loved this book, I love the story, and I am grateful Margot Shetterly brought it to light. My only complaint was that I wished she discussed Katherine Johnson's role in the later missions a bit more but I guess the story had to end som...<br/><br/>I wanted to like this book and I did throughout most of it.

I really enjoyed seei... | Con Acción de Gracias a la vuelta de la esquina, aquí hay algunos juegos de carpetas de archivos festivos que hicimos para las chicas. Ambos juegos de Acción de Gracias se centran en las habilidades matemáticas. Y estoy agradecido una vez más a mi esposo, Ed, por hacer todo el clipart para mí.<br/><br/>Patrones de Acción de Gracias<br/><br/>Como su nombre indica, este juego se trata de hacer patrones. Los pequeños que acaban de aprender sobre patrones, simplemente pueden hacer coincidir las imágenes en las tiras de patrones, mientras que otros pueden continuar el patrón con las tarjetas de imágenes en las tiras en blanco.<br/><br/>Para hacer la carpeta de archivos, desea recortar la cuadrícula de imágenes para hacer las piezas de la tarjeta. Recomiendo laminarlas para ayudarlas a durar más tiempo. Luego pegue las tiras de patrones en la carpeta de archivos.<br/><br/>Quería tener las tiras de patrón en blanco también para que las chicas pudieran ver dónde continuar el patrón y cuántos poner. Los uní al lado de la carpeta usando cinta para que pudieran plegarse para empacar el juego y extenderse para diseñar el patrón.<br/><br/>También agregué uno en blanco adicional para que las chicas pudieran hacer su propio patrón también.<br/><br/>Número de Turquía Juego<br/><br/>En este juego las chicas agregan las plumas al cuerpo del pavo mientras practican el conteo y el reconocimiento de números. Utilicé las plumas incoloras para actuar como una guía de dónde agregar las plumas y para que las chicas pudieran coincidir con los números. Y asegúrese de que al pegar el cuerpo del pavo solo pegue en el centro para que las piezas del ala puedan deslizarse debajo del cuerpo.<br/><br/>Una vez que todas las plumas están dispuestas, practicamos algo de aritmética simple, como quitar tres plumas y ver cuántas quedan y luego agregar dos para ver qué es lo que equivale.<br/><br/>Además de las alas en blanco y negro, también incluimos un pavo incoloro en caso de que quieras tener a los más pequeños coloreando su propio conjunto. En lugar de un juego de carpetas de archivos, puede convertir esto en un arte, colorear las piezas, cortarlas y pegarlas.<br/><br/>Otra opción es usar las piezas para hacer una historia de fieltro. A veces cantamos una versión de pavo de 10 Little Indians:<br/><br/>Me gusta:<br/><br/>¿Quién soy?<br/><br/>Creo que aquí es donde se supone que debo decir algo ingenioso sobre mí. Soy una ama de casa de tres hijos increíbles, nuestras hijas gemelas que ahora tienen siete años y un hijo de dos años que está lleno de energía. En mi vida pre-niños yo era un maestro y ahora homeschool nuestros hijos. También estoy casado con Ed, que actualmente está sirviendo en la Fuerza Aérea, y es el amor de mi vida (sería incómodo si no lo fuera). Nuestra familia es grande en libros, artesanías y divertirse juntos. Solo pensé en compartir nuestras actividades en mi propio pequeño rincón de Internet.<br/><br/>Zoe parece tenerlo todo, un marido rico y guapo, una vida fácil en Nueva York, pero cometió errores en su pasado y esos errores vuelven a aparecer en su nueva vida.<br/><br/>Me encantó este libro, me encanta la historia, y estoy agradecido Margot Shetterly trajo a la luz. Mi única queja fue que me gustaría que ella discutió el papel de Katherine Johnson en las misiones posteriores un poco más, pero supongo que la historia tenía que terminar así ...<br/><br/>Quería que me gustara este libro y lo hice durante la mayor parte. Dana descubre que su esposo separado y su novia se encuentran muertos en el desierto de Nuevo México. Inmediatamente me atrajo su personaje y la historia. Realmente disfruté v... |
| Alcohol use by persons under age 21 has been identified as a major public health problem. Studies note that it increases the risks for disability, and may be detrimental to the developing brain. Minors who drink are more likely to commit suicide, break the law, or be victims of violence. Alcohol is implicated in nearly one-third of youth traffic fatalities. The total annual cost of underage drinking is estimated at $62 billion. While most laws intended to prevent underage drinking are passed at the state level, there has been legislative activity and interest at the federal level to support states' efforts to curb the problem. This report describes the extent of underage alcohol use, recent legislative activity on this issue, and various policy implications. It will be updated as new data become available. | El consumo de alcohol por personas menores de 21 años se ha identificado como un problema importante de salud pública. Los estudios señalan que aumenta los riesgos de discapacidad y puede ser perjudicial para el cerebro en desarrollo. Los menores que beben tienen más probabilidades de cometer suicidio, violar la ley o ser víctimas de violencia. El alcohol está implicado en casi un tercio de las muertes de tráfico juvenil. El costo total anual del consumo de alcohol por menores de edad se estima en $ 62 mil millones. Si bien la mayoría de las leyes destinadas a prevenir el consumo de alcohol por menores de edad se aprueban a nivel estatal, ha habido actividad legislativa e interés a nivel federal para apoyar los esfuerzos de los estados para frenar el problema. Este informe describe el alcance del consumo de alcohol por menores de edad, la actividad legislativa reciente sobre este tema y las diversas implicaciones políticas. Se actualizará a medida que se disponga de nuevos datos. |
| Tag Archives: real food<br/><br/>Last week I wrote about the Nordic Food Manifesto, and how Denmark created a strong "real food" culture largely from an intentional effort led by Claus Meyer. It wasn't political lobbying or public petitioning that resulted in food reform, but rather a grassroots effort led by citizens with the power to actually implement and follow-through with change.<br/><br/>I ended the post alluding to one question: Why is it so hard for us to do this ourselves, as individuals? If an entire country can implement and spread a common view towards food, why can't we?<br/><br/>There's nothing really stopping us from mimicking Denmark's success. The problem is, we're inundated with so many messages about what we should be eating, and how we should be living, it's hard to know where to start. So rather than following successful frameworks that have been shown to work (like the Nordic Food Manifesto), most people jump from diet craze to diet craze, trying to find the "right way to eat."<br/><br/>But how did Claus Meyer succeed? What was the secret sauce that helped the Manifesto take hold? And is it reasonable to think we can apply those lessons to our own lives? Continue reading →<br/><br/>Share this:<br/><br/>My knife plunged into the beef with an audible crunch, pop, and sizzle.<br/><br/>"Whooaaah!"<br/><br/>I looked up at my sister as we both laughed in surprise, and continued smiling as I finished cutting my first bite. The unique outer crispiness of the meat gave way to a perfectly juicy interior, resulting in a sound more similar to slicing into a calzone than a ground beef patty.<br/><br/>We were sitting in Copenhagen's oldest pub, which felt more like a casual bistro than a bar, and I was about to try the dish recommended by our waitress/bar tender/proprietor?<br/><br/>"The Paris Beef, it's very good," she had said. "It's not from France… it's very Danish."<br/><br/>Sign me up!<br/><br/>Paris beef with fresh veggies and raw egg yolk at Rabes Have in Copenhagen | Archivo de la etiqueta: comida real<br/><br/>La semana pasada escribí sobre el Manifiesto Nórdico de la Alimentación, y cómo Dinamarca creó una fuerte cultura de la "comida real" en gran parte a partir de un esfuerzo intencional dirigido por Claus Meyer. No fue el cabildeo político o la petición pública lo que resultó en una reforma alimentaria, sino más bien un esfuerzo de base liderado por ciudadanos con el poder de implementar y seguir con el cambio.<br/><br/>Terminé el post aludiendo a una pregunta: ¿Por qué es tan difícil para nosotros hacer esto nosotros mismos, como individuos? Si todo un país puede implementar y difundir una visión común hacia la comida, ¿por qué no podemos?<br/><br/>No hay nada que nos impida imitar el éxito de Dinamarca. El problema es que estamos inundados con tantos mensajes sobre lo que deberíamos comer y cómo deberíamos vivir. Es difícil saber por dónde empezar. Entonces, en lugar de seguir marcos exitosos que se ha demostrado que funcionan (como el Manifiesto Nórdico de Alimentos), la mayoría de las personas saltan de la locura de la dieta a la locura de la dieta, tratando de encontrar la "manera correcta de comer".<br/><br/>Pero, ¿cómo tuvo éxito Claus Meyer? ¿Cuál fue la salsa secreta que ayudó al Manifiesto a afianzarse? ¿Y es razonable pensar que podemos aplicar esas lecciones a nuestras propias vidas?<br/><br/>Comparte esto:<br/><br/>Mi cuchillo se hundió en la carne con un crujido audible, estallido y chisporroteo.<br/><br/>"Whooaaah!"<br/><br/>Miré a mi hermana mientras los dos nos reíamos sorprendidos, y continué sonriendo cuando terminé de cortar mi primer bocado. La crujiente exterior única de la carne dio paso a un interior perfectamente jugoso, lo que resultó en un sonido más similar a cortar en una calzona que una empanada de carne molida.<br/><br/>Estábamos sentados en el pub más antiguo de Copenhague, que se sentía más como un bistro casual que un bar, y yo estaba a punto de probar el plato recomendado por nuestra camarera / bar tierno / propietario?<br/><br/>"La carne de vacuno de París, es muy buena", había dicho.
