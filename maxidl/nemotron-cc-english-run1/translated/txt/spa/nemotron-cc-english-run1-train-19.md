| Quidditch through the ages<br/><br/>I was doodling some quidditch-related objects like broomsticks and snitches and whatnot and it sort of turned into this odd compilation of things, including Harry down there at the bottom. I am not completely satisfied with the way it came out, but since it's not bad for my second Harry Potter fan-art picture, I decided to color it anyway. If you are wondering where his scar is, it's there, but it's very very light and small because I did that bit on the computer. Sketched in pen, colored in Paint. | Quidditch a través de las edades<br/><br/>Estaba garabateando algunos objetos relacionados con quidditch como escobas y soplones y todo eso y se convirtió en una especie de extraña compilación de cosas, incluido Harry allí en la parte inferior. No estoy completamente satisfecho con la forma en que salió, pero como no está mal para mi segunda película de Harry Potter, decidí colorearla de todos modos. Si te estás preguntando dónde está su cicatriz, está ahí, pero es muy, muy ligera y pequeña porque hice eso en la computadora. |
| I just started saltwater fly fishing this summer and I need a new reel, so it'll definitely be the Kraken. (I'm in Florida; we don't have those little trout minnow things around here. ) Private Message on the way to you.<br/><br/>I'm thrilled and flattered. I'm also trying to figure out a way to explain to She-Who-Must-Be-Obeyed that I'll need to buy a new rod worthy of this reel.....<br/><br/>I've always found that no explanation is the best explanation. Don't give her a reason to ever say you're not spontaneous enough. | Acabo de comenzar la pesca con mosca de agua salada este verano y necesito un nuevo carrete, así que definitivamente será el Kraken. (Estoy en Florida; no tenemos esas pequeñas cosas de truchas por aquí. ) Mensaje privado en el camino a usted.<br/><br/>Estoy emocionado y halagado. También estoy tratando de encontrar una manera de explicarle a She-Who-Must-Be-Obeyed que necesitaré comprar una nueva vara digna de este carrete .....<br/><br/>Siempre he encontrado que ninguna explicación es la mejor explicación, no le des una razón para decir que no eres lo suficientemente espontánea. |
| If you were admitted and enrolled --> yes If you were admitted and attended another school --> yes If you took extension courses (do they even have them there? I know UCLA does) --> yes If you went to graduate school there --> yes<br/><br/>That's my interpretation because any of these scenarios would fulfill either being "admitted to an undergraduate program" or "taking courses" at UC Berkeley. I could be completely wrong though, you're better off just calling them and clarifying your specific situation.<br/><br/>My opinion: Based on the wording, I interpreted it as asking if you were admitted to Berkeley undergrad, whether or not you chose to attend. If it meant admitted and attended, they could easily have seen that through the "Undergrad Institutions" portion of the application. | Si usted fue admitido y matriculado --- sí Si usted fue admitido y asistió a otra escuela --- sí Si usted tomó cursos de extensión (¿incluso los tienen allí? Sé que lo hace UCLA) --- sí Si usted fue a la escuela de posgrado allí --- sí<br/><br/>Esa es mi interpretación porque cualquiera de estos escenarios cumpliría con ser "admitido a un programa de pregrado" o "tomar cursos" en UC Berkeley. Sin embargo, podría estar completamente equivocado, es mejor que simplemente los llame y aclare su situación específica.<br/><br/>Mi opinión: Basado en la redacción, lo interpreté como preguntando si usted fue admitido en Berkeley, si eligió o no asistir. Si significaba admitido y asistido, fácilmente podrían haberlo visto a través de la parte "Instituciones Undergrad" de la aplicación. |
| ...........A lot of the time head bolts are angle tightened so you set them at say 20Nm for a starting point then angle tighten them from there.<br/><br/>.....I would have preferred a bigger hammer<br/><br/>Cheers.<br/><br/>You can never have too big a hammer<br/><br/>I'll confess.<br/>There must be a fine distinction between torque setting with a Click torque wrench and angle setting but even as an engineer, I don't really understand it.<br/><br/>To me, if you tighten a bolt you get to a point when it locks. And as TTT says at a relatively low torque. After that, further tightening both increases the torque load and the head angle ??<br/><br/>To me it's a distinction between measurement techniques rather then final result.

| Winter Protection for Fig Trees<br/><br/>Report This Article<br/><br/>Winter Protection for Fig Trees<br/><br/>Overview<br/><br/>The fig tree has been around since at least 5,000 B.C., and is grown throughout the world for its delicious fruit. Figs grow well in a mild climate without weather extremes. The fig tree is now propagated in some areas with harsh winters. Protective precautions are required to save the tree from winter damage.<br/><br/>Potted Fig Trees<br/><br/>Ornamental fig trees in pots can stand some freezing and do not require light once they enter the winter dormancy phase. Avoid extreme swings in temperature by placing the fig tree in a controlled environment such as a garage, where temperatures range between slightly under freezing and slight above. The plant should be watered as the soil dries.<br/><br/>Shielding<br/><br/>Shielding to protect the tree from the most extreme winter weather is required. Fig trees require placement in soil areas where the soil does not freeze to protect it from disease and increase its chances of winter survival. Large screens placed around the tree protects it from winter winds that can damage and freeze the wood.<br/><br/>Wrapping<br/><br/>Tree wrapping protects the tree from cold weather and prevents hard winds from destroying the branches. Fig tree wrapping should be applied once the leaves from the tree have fallen to prevent leaves from rotting inside the wrapping material. Fig trees are sensitive to slight temperature changes. It can not warm up inside the protective film or else the tree may begin to grow, making it susceptible to severe damage during the cold snap.<br/><br/>Planting<br/><br/>Cultivar practices help to protect the fig tree during harsh winters. Varieties that are resistant to cold weather are best for locations where the weathers are harsh. Brown Turkey, Brunswick and Blue Celeste are good cultivars for cold weather. Planting should be done against a wall or structure that will radiate heat towards the tree during the winter months.<br/><br/>Snow<br/><br/>Roots of the fig tree require dry soil during the winter dormancy period. Watering should be done only when the soil is dry and the roots should be protected from melting snow and rain. Protection placed on the ground under the tree, near the trunk--to keep water from draining into the soil--protects the tree from damage.<br/><br/>Keywords:<br/>fig tree protection, fig tree winter, fig tree care | Protección de invierno para higueras<br/><br/>Reportar este artículo<br/><br/>Protección de invierno para higueras<br/><br/>Sinopsis<br/><br/>La higuera ha existido desde al menos 5.000 aC, y se cultiva en todo el mundo por su deliciosa fruta.

| Oculus CEO comes down hard on Mac support for the Rift<br/><br/>Oculus CEO, Palmer Luckey, has not minced his words when asked in an interview whether the Rift VR headset will ever support the Mac. If you had any hopes of it being soon, you might want to ready yourselves for some disappointment.<br/><br/>That is up to Apple. If they ever release a good computer, we will do it.<br/><br/>What he's referring to there in a less diplomatic sense is the discrete graphics required to run the Rift. The simple truth is that Apple just doesn't go for high-end graphics that will meet the requirements for the headset. For context, on a Windows PC, you need a minimum of an NVIDIA GTX 970, a $300 graphics card.<br/><br/>As Luckey went on to say:<br/><br/>It just boils down to the fact that Apple doesn't prioritize high-end GPUs. You can buy a $6,000 Mac Pro with the top of the line AMD FirePro D700, and it still doesn't match our recommended specs. So if they prioritize higher-end GPUs like they used to for a while back in the day, we'd love to support Mac. But right now, there's just not a single machine out there that supports it.<br/><br/>The Mac Pro can't be accused of not packing plenty of horsepower, because it does, but equally FirePro graphics are targeted more towards the creative market, just like the Mac Pro. The Mac Pro in particular far exceeds other hardware requirements, but naturally as the Rift is graphics heavy, this is where the shortfall is. Luckey is perhaps being a little over the top, but equally he's the man behind the Rift, so there's no doubts plenty of truth to what he says. Even if he doesn't say it particularly well.<br/><br/>What say you, Mac owners of the world? Are you even bothered about the Oculus Rift or is it something you wish you could have? Sound off in the comments below!<br/><br/>Reader comments<br/><br/>Oculus CEO comes down hard on Mac support for the Rift<br/><br/>No, not bothered by it since I really wasn't planning on buying an Oculus Rift. For me the product category is still too early and too much in a beta-kinda phase. But he does rise a valid point. Apple should try to get more ahead of the pack CPU/GPU wise. Right now they're always trailing behind.<br/><br/>Excuse me, but what is HTC Vive better at? And Oculus Rift most certainly supports Linux machines that meet their hardware specifications! (The issue is not OS but hardware.)<br/><br/>Also, look at WHY the HTC Vive supports OS X: it includes more of its own hardware. (Which is why it costs so much.) The Oculus solutions - both the Rift and the Samsung Gear VR - require the hardware that it is plugging into to perform more of the heavy lifting.<br/><br/>VR isn't a gimmick. 3D TVs don't always give that much of a 3d effect, and it doesn't work with everyone. VR works with everyone, and the Oculus and HTC Vive official release products have almost no latency so there shoudn't be any motion sickness. There's also plenty of game support<br/><br/>Obviously if gaming is a priority you're generally not in the market for a Mac, though. Not many game developers support OSX so these types of devices likely have limited use on a Mac (for gaming, anyways, which the Rift was designed for). At least that's the only reason I could see myself using one. I definitely wouldn't use it for watching movies.<br/><br/>Apple did implement the Metal engine into El Capitan, there might be some plan to go into the gaming market (as Apple learned from iOS how big this market is, just look at the top grossing apps).<br/>So now the hardware is missing and and game devs would probably show some interest, since Macs there are now an acceptable amount of Mac users around the world.<br/><br/>I would like to see Apple make its way into that sector of the industry. I don't use any Apple products presently but they're making a lot of the right moves in many areas and I'm very intrigued.<br/><br/>Plus, competition fuels innovation. I know that major computer part manufactures already create that competition but Apple has the RnD willpower and the cash to really turn heads. They may not win the numbers games in terms of specs, they actually rarely do, but most people who care to do the research know that performance != the sum of the device's parts. Apple can do more with "less". On paper their products appear inferior but when carefully balanced hardware meets specifically engineered software they generally perform just as well as the competition if not out perform.<br/><br/>HA! I love how, all of a sudden, having a high performance computer is not important to Apple phans! There is not a single Mac capable of the highest end graphics. Can't buy one, can't build one. Mac is not capable of being the highest in performance and you are good with that. HA! Classic!<br/><br/>I bought my MacBook Pro Retina in 2012 because of the high resolution screen and the non-discrete GPU. However, for my desktop I built a system with a 4K monitor, i7 4790K CPU, 3 GTX 970 GPU's, and 16 gb of memory all for less than what I'd pay for an iMac. I even have an SSD set up to boot in OSX. My point is Apple could do similar things if it wished, but doesn't. In fact, look at the most recent iMac. It includes discrete graphics and a slow 5400 RPM drive. My computer may not look as pretty, and it's not as thin, but in the end it's more useful - isn't that why we buy a computer in the first place?<br/><br/>I don't see why a Mac pro can not make use of the Oculus isn't it built for rendering video. I understand that it will not be able to run on iMac's and because of this the Oculus should be branded for Pro users due to the requirements and come at the price.<br/><br/>Now people are saying that your computer is doing ALL the heavy lifting, so why is the price point over $800 for something that isn't doing anything?<br/><br/>I'm excited about the direction of VR but not where it is at the moment.<br/><br/>Your display (which the Rift is) never does any of the heavy lifting. It's $800 because of what the display does; 110° viewing angle (still not human eye but much closer than other displays) with super low latency to reduce or eliminate motion sickness on a 1200x1800 per eye display for HD quality.<br/><br/>And yes, Mac's are very widely used for video rendering, but that rendering doesn't happen at 30+fps. It can take video rendering machines hours to render a single frame and sometimes years to render an entire movie. The final products, or pre-rendered material, is what then becomes 30+fps.<br/><br/>Thank you @TheRealFixxer<br/>Alot of what you say makes sense and some I was unaware of.<br/><br/>I guess I don't see VR as a game, but as an immersion and seeing Mac's are good at 3dcad and compiling video I would think they would be able to compile a scene well. I've even seen 3d renders of movie walk through. Creating a 3d world and placing cameras in areas to figure out how a scene would look<br/><br/>But I agree Mac's make more use of CPU cycles even by using there GPU's to help. WIth that said there are other directions one could take it. Like external thunderbolt video cards.<br/><br/>My big grip is the fact Octulas is looked at as a consumer product. If the requirements are that high, then it's more a pro product and needs to be advertized as that. I understand the technology is there but don't feel it's there to call it a consumer product.<br/><br/>Yes, you are right. Apple also has issues with software. Most aren't using "metal" the apple programming language which speeds up the processing for games because it's an Apple only solution where many use game engines that work on Microsoft Direct X or open source Opengl which most games use to run on Linux and oSX. Opengl is around 20% slower and sometime a lot more than that compared to direct x so a top of the line gaming card running in oSX runs as fast is a mid level gaming card in windows. So big problems not to mention most macs have built in cards that have no upgradability.<br/><br/>The mac pro is so different that Apple would have to do this as it wouldn't be worth a card vendor doing this as there is no profit in it for them with the small amount of possible buyers there would be for this. Apple doesn't like to loose money so I don't see this ever happening. Apple would loose money offering video card upgrades for mac pros.<br/><br/>Well he has a point though I do t care about oculus rift, rather wait for starVR. There should be an option to add better GPUs into an iMac and MacBook Pro. It is also sad that there is no more nVidia card, I liked the CUDA support now I will have to buy a PC and install Linux for my CUDA projects.<br/><br/>Gaming is a growing market and it won't be long until even iPhones have more GPU performance than the Macs. I agree that Apple should offer a high end GPU in a Mac<br/><br/>I am very bothered by the lack of high performance discrete graphics on Mac computers. Even the top of the like iMac uses an out of date mobile GPU which, of course, cannot be upgraded. If I want to develop software for VR, Apple has left me no choice but to buy or build a PC to run it on. As a big Apple fan (yes I admit it) this make me rather sad.<br/><br/>BTW, VR is not some passing fad. If you have tried it you know what I mean. VR is going to change gaming and content creation forever. My only worry about VR is that is too good. There could be millions of people that will become addicted to living and playing in virtual worlds. Look at how many people got addicted to MMOs that played on a flat screen. With VR you really feel like you are in the game.<br/><br/>Not worried about anything, i am pretty sure apple will have its own implementation for Mac and iOS when tech will be ready for consumers, right now it is more for hardcore users. Like always apple like to time its presence on right time, with right product. Have faith in apple.<br/><br/>It's funny that a lot of people know which vr is better based on os support. I guess you guys did heavy testing and now are the guy in the big electronic store that knows best.<br/><br/>HTC said it will bring support to the osx but that still needs to be seen.<br/><br/>I understand that a lot of you guys are stamped on there d**ks. But understand that Apple is more focused on laptops. And laptops can't be packed with more power than a PC, due to size, heat, power consumption etc.<br/><br/>He is right, even though he put it in **** terms. I love my Mac but Lord it needs a boost in graphics. Not that it needs to cost more but I would be more than willing to pay a little extra for a better graphics card or at least have the option to install my own. It's really too bad this guy had to make his statement sound like he is just plain uneducated. | CEO de Oculus cae duro en el soporte de Mac para el Rift<br/><br/>El CEO de Oculus, Palmer Luckey, no ha escatimado sus palabras cuando se le preguntó en una entrevista si los auriculares Rift VR alguna vez apoyarán al Mac. Si tenía alguna esperanza de que fuera pronto, es posible que desee prepararse para alguna decepción.<br/><br/>Eso depende de Apple. Si alguna vez lanzan una buena computadora, lo haremos.<br/><br/>A lo que se refiere allí en un sentido menos diplomático son los gráficos discretos necesarios para ejecutar el Rift. La simple verdad es que Apple simplemente no va por gráficos de alta gama que cumplan con los requisitos para los auriculares. Para el contexto, en una PC con Windows, necesita un mínimo de una NVIDIA GTX 970, una tarjeta gráfica de $ 300.<br/><br/>Como dijo Luckey:<br/><br/>Simplemente se reduce al hecho de que Apple no prioriza las GPU de gama alta. Puedes comprar una Mac Pro de $ 6,000 con la parte superior de la línea AMD FirePro D700, y aún no coincide con nuestras especificaciones recomendadas. Entonces, si priorizan las GPU de gama alta como solían hacerlo hace un tiempo, nos encantaría admitir Mac, pero en este momento, no hay una sola máquina que lo admita.<br/><br/>El Mac Pro no puede ser acusado de no tener muchos caballos de fuerza, porque sí, pero igualmente los gráficos FirePro están dirigidos más hacia el mercado creativo, al igual que el Mac Pro. El Mac Pro, en particular, supera con creces otros requisitos de hardware, pero naturalmente, como el Rift es gráfico pesado, aquí es donde está el déficit. Luckey es tal vez un poco exagerado, pero igualmente es el hombre detrás de la grieta, así que no hay duda de la verdad de lo que dice, incluso si no lo dice particularmente bien.<br/><br/>¿Qué les parece a ustedes, los dueños de Mac del mundo? ¿Están preocupados por el Oculus Rift o es algo que desearían tener? ¡Suena apagado en los comentarios a continuación!<br/><br/>Comentarios de los lectores<br/><br/>CEO de Oculus cae duro en el soporte de Mac para el Rift<br/><br/>No, no me molestó, ya que realmente no estaba planeando comprar un Oculus Rift. Para mí, la categoría de productos aún es demasiado temprana y está demasiado en fase beta. Pero él plantea un punto válido. Apple debería tratar de adelantarse al paquete de CPU / GPU. En este momento siempre están detrás.<br/><br/>Disculpe, pero ¿en qué es mejor HTC Vive? ¡Y Oculus Rift ciertamente es compatible con máquinas Linux que cumplen con sus especificaciones de hardware! (El problema no es el sistema operativo, sino el hardware).<br/><br/>Además, mira por qué el HTC Vive es compatible con OS X: incluye más de su propio hardware. (Por eso cuesta tanto.) Las soluciones de Oculus, tanto el Rift como el Samsung Gear VR, requieren el hardware en el que se está conectando para realizar más del trabajo pesado.<br/><br/>La realidad virtual no es un truco. Los televisores 3D no siempre dan mucho efecto 3D, y no funciona con todos. La realidad virtual funciona con todos, y los productos de lanzamiento oficial de Oculus y HTC Vive casi no tienen latencia, por lo que no hay ningún mareo por movimiento. También hay un montón de apoyo de juego<br/><br/>Obviamente, si el juego es una prioridad, generalmente no está en el mercado para una Mac, sin embargo, no muchos desarrolladores de juegos admiten OSX, por lo que este tipo de dispositivos probablemente tengan un uso limitado en una Mac (para juegos, de todos modos, para el que fue diseñado el Rift). Al menos esa es la única razón por la que podría verme usando uno. Definitivamente no lo usaría para ver películas.<br/><br/>Apple implementó el motor de Metal en El Capitan, podría haber algún plan para ingresar al mercado de los juegos (como Apple aprendió de iOS cuán grande es este mercado, solo mire las aplicaciones más taquilleras).<br/>Así que ahora falta el hardware y los desarrolladores de juegos probablemente muestren algo de interés, ya que ahora hay una cantidad aceptable de usuarios de Mac en todo el mundo.<br/><br/>Me gustaría ver a Apple abrirse camino en ese sector de la industria. No uso ningún producto de Apple en la actualidad, pero están haciendo muchos de los movimientos correctos en muchas áreas y estoy muy intrigado.<br/><br/>Además, la competencia alimenta la innovación. Sé que los principales fabricantes de piezas de computadoras ya crean esa competencia, pero Apple tiene la fuerza de voluntad RnD y el dinero para llamar la atención. Es posible que no ganen los juegos de números en términos de especificaciones, en realidad rara vez lo hacen, pero la mayoría de las personas que se preocupan por hacer la investigación saben que el rendimiento es la suma de las partes del dispositivo. En el papel, sus productos parecen inferiores, pero cuando el hardware cuidadosamente equilibrado cumple con el software específicamente diseñado, generalmente funcionan tan bien como la competencia si no lo hacen.<br/><br/>¡HA! Me encanta cómo, de repente, tener una computadora de alto rendimiento no es importante para los fanáticos de Apple. No hay un solo Mac capaz de los gráficos de gama alta. No puedo comprar uno, no puedo construir uno. Mac no es capaz de ser el más alto en rendimiento y que son buenos con eso. HA! Clásico!<br/><br/>Compré mi MacBook Pro Retina en 2012 debido a la pantalla de alta resolución y la GPU no discreta. Sin embargo, para mi escritorio construí un sistema con un monitor 4K, una CPU i7 4790K, 3 GPU GTX 970 y 16 GB de memoria, todo por menos de lo que pagaría por un iMac. Incluso tengo un SSD configurado para arrancar en OSX. Mi punto es que Apple podría hacer cosas similares si lo desea, pero no lo hace. De hecho, mira el iMac más reciente. Incluye gráficos discretos y una unidad lenta de 5400 RPM. Mi computadora puede no parecer tan bonita, y no es tan delgada, pero al final es más útil, ¿no es por eso que compramos una computadora en primer lugar?<br/><br/>No veo por qué un Mac Pro no puede hacer uso del Oculus no está diseñado para renderizar video. Entiendo que no podrá ejecutarse en iMac y, debido a esto, el Oculus debe marcarse para usuarios Pro debido a los requisitos y al precio.<br/><br/>Ahora la gente está diciendo que su computadora está haciendo todo el trabajo pesado, así que ¿por qué el precio es de más de $ 800 para algo que no está haciendo nada?<br/><br/>Estoy entusiasmado con la dirección de VR, pero no dónde está en este momento.<br/><br/>Su pantalla (que es el Rift) nunca hace nada del trabajo pesado. Es $ 800 debido a lo que hace la pantalla; ángulo de visión de 110 ° (todavía no ojo humano, pero mucho más cerca que otras pantallas) con latencia súper baja para reducir o eliminar el mareo por movimiento en una pantalla de 1200x1800 por ojo para calidad HD.<br/><br/>Y sí, los Mac son muy utilizados para la representación de video, pero esa representación no sucede a 30+fps. Puede llevar horas a las máquinas de representación de video renderizar un solo fotograma y, a veces, años renderizar una película completa. Los productos finales, o material pre-renderizado, es lo que luego se convierte en 30 + fps.<br/><br/>Gracias por tu calificación<br/>Mucho de lo que dices tiene sentido y algo de lo que no estaba al tanto.<br/><br/>Supongo que no veo la realidad virtual como un juego, pero como una inmersión y ver que los Mac son buenos en 3dcad y compilar video, creo que podrían compilar una escena bien. Incluso he visto renderizados en 3D de películas. Crear un mundo en 3D y colocar cámaras en áreas para descubrir cómo se vería una escena<br/><br/>Pero estoy de acuerdo Mac hacer más uso de los ciclos de la CPU, incluso mediante el uso de GPU para ayudar. Con que dijo que hay otras direcciones que uno podría tomar. Como las tarjetas de vídeo de rayos externos.<br/><br/>Mi gran agarre es el hecho de que Octulas es visto como un producto de consumo. Si los requisitos son tan altos, entonces es más un producto profesional y necesita ser anunciado como tal. Entiendo que la tecnología está ahí, pero no siento que esté ahí para llamarlo un producto de consumo.<br/><br/>Sí, tienes razón, Apple también tiene problemas con el software. La mayoría no está usando "metal" el lenguaje de programación de Apple que acelera el procesamiento de juegos porque es una solución única de Apple donde muchos usan motores de juegos que funcionan en Microsoft Direct X o Opengl de código abierto que la mayoría de los juegos usan para ejecutarse en Linux y oSX. Opengl es alrededor de un 20% más lento y en algún momento mucho más que eso en comparación con la x directa, por lo que una tarjeta de juego de primera línea que se ejecuta en oSX se ejecuta tan rápido como una tarjeta de juego de nivel medio en Windows. Así que grandes problemas por no hablar de la mayoría de los Mac han construido en las tarjetas que no tienen capacidad de actualización.<br/><br/>El Mac Pro es tan diferente que Apple tendría que hacer esto, ya que no valdría la pena que un vendedor de tarjetas lo hiciera, ya que no hay ganancias para ellos con la pequeña cantidad de posibles compradores que habría para esto. A Apple no le gusta perder dinero, así que no veo que esto suceda. Apple perdería dinero ofreciendo actualizaciones de tarjetas de video para profesionales de Mac.<br/><br/>Bueno, él tiene un punto, aunque no me importa oculus rift, en lugar de esperar a starVR. Debería haber una opción para agregar mejores GPU en un iMac y MacBook Pro. También es triste que no haya más tarjeta nVidia, me gustó el soporte de CUDA ahora tendré que comprar un PC e instalar Linux para mis proyectos CUDA.<br/><br/>Los juegos son un mercado en crecimiento y no pasará mucho tiempo hasta que incluso los iPhones tengan más rendimiento de GPU que los Macs. Estoy de acuerdo en que Apple debería ofrecer una GPU de gama alta en un Mac<br/><br/>Me molesta mucho la falta de gráficos discretos de alto rendimiento en las computadoras Mac. Incluso la parte superior de un iMac similar utiliza una GPU móvil obsoleta que, por supuesto, no se puede actualizar. Si quiero desarrollar software para VR, Apple no me ha dejado otra opción que comprar o construir un PC para ejecutarlo. Como un gran fan de Apple (sí, lo admito) esto me pone bastante triste.<br/><br/>Por cierto, VR no es una moda pasajera. Si lo has probado, sabes lo que quiero decir. VR va a cambiar los juegos y la creación de contenido para siempre. Mi única preocupación sobre VR es que es demasiado bueno. Podría haber millones de personas que se volverán adictas a vivir y jugar en mundos virtuales. Mira cuántas personas se volvieron adictas a los MMO que jugaron en una pantalla plana. Con VR realmente sientes que estás en el juego.<br/><br/>No estoy preocupado por nada, estoy bastante seguro de que Apple tendrá su propia implementación para Mac e iOS cuando la tecnología esté lista para los consumidores, en este momento es más para usuarios hardcore. Como siempre, a la manzana le gusta cronometrar su presencia en el momento adecuado, con el producto correcto.<br/><br/>Es gracioso que mucha gente sepa qué vr es mejor basado en el soporte de OS. Supongo que ustedes hicieron pruebas pesadas y ahora son el tipo en la gran tienda electrónica que mejor sabe.<br/><br/>HTC dijo que traerá soporte para el osx, pero eso aún necesita ser visto.<br/><br/>Entiendo que muchos de ustedes están estampados allí, pero entiendo que Apple está más enfocado en las computadoras portátiles. Y las computadoras portátiles no pueden empacarse con más energía que una PC, debido al tamaño, el calor, el consumo de energía, etc.<br/><br/>Él tiene razón, a pesar de que lo puso en términos . Me encanta mi Mac, pero Señor que necesita un impulso en los gráficos. No es que tenga que costar más, pero estaría más que dispuesto a pagar un poco más por una mejor tarjeta gráfica o al menos tener la opción de instalar la mía.

| What Guys Said 19<br/><br/>No, it is because entertainment producers and product marketers want actors/actresses and models who look like the majority of the audience, so that they are relatable and therefore more effective sales tools. I am sure that Asian women look wonderful to Asian men. To me, as a white man, they have zero appeal.<br/><br/>@cowboy101 I am 100 per cent straight. I do not go outside of my race. When I was a soldier I had the "me love you long time" experience in Asia. That has left me feeling uncomfortable whenever there are Asian females near me. Sometimes I become profoundly uncomfortable, even though the particular individuals have done nothing to merit it. During a visit to Thailand, I found that the only way to prevent myself being propositioned on the street was to take white a female with me as a minder.<br/><br/>Aha the thing is that there isn't many white people (or any at all) in China, but in 'white' places, (or at least Australia) there are quite a lot of Asians around there, which made me think about this question...<br/><br/>Maybe in parts of the country where you stick at (remember, birds of a feather...), just like to republicans it seems that most people are republican etc. While it can only be small minority that you are surrounded by.<br/><br/>And as far as I know, there are a lot of whites in china, mainly by business, etc. But it's simple, most of people there are Asian, so they prefere Asian girls (dogs like dogs , cats like cats, most people prefere their own kind). And there is nothing wrong with that. Same is in white countries.<br/><br/>I think Asians are the most beautful. Unfortunately for me the 2 I got involved with in my life one was using me for my place/internet a long time ago and the recent one was a gold digging stupid bitch. She never graduated college and was 30. I would be extremely happy if I met a smart cute Asian woman near my age that was not a gold digger.<br/><br/>@Prettyapathetic yes because when a man loves deeply he always good with you on bed no matter size of tits or colour of skin and a real man always respect a girl in every relation like mother, sister, wife, girlfriend etc<br/><br/>as a model from childhood I got my start with a company called sugar & spice. I was recruited in Japan while my family was stationed there.<br/><br/>you get a job because they are going for a certain look, who are they targeting, and the area you live in.<br/><br/>I had to leave the industry last year because of health reasons. I worked with with many types of people, korean, Japanese, chinese, polish, german, American, Spanish, arabic. I've worked with children, adults, teenagers all of these ethnicities.<br/><br/>I am half white half Native American (Lakota) so they loved my look from a young age. but there are many beauty standards in the industry and not all of them are as portrayed, some being made to look worse, and some not taken seriously enough...<br/><br/>Nope, it's because the Asian men are jealous and angry and invent thousands of excuses every rare time who have Asian women in the media because they are jealous of Asian women, and Americans want to keep the status of white women, this is why the couples between Asian women and white men are boycotted and all other race with white women are pushed, it's white women wiht white men and white women with other races in American media, since it's opression and offensive for the ego of men of other race the women of own race with white but white women with other race is "anti-racism". You need to understand the American political social engineering all over these years of media, democrats, politics and propaganda.<br/><br/>Anyway, in countries like china, japan, korea they have Asian men and Asian women only and the only exceptions are when they import a white women to make some fantasy scene for them but it's not so much, it's forbiden expose the hatred and jealousy of some Asian men.<br/><br/>The Asian boys will be happy if you say something against other men, but they will be angry if you say that the Asian girl will die for the blond girl date the handsome caucasian/white dude, they will try to force Asian women to make anything against these men to these small vocal group of Asian men feel better in their hatred, excuses, racism and jealousy. This is why Asian women is not showed so much, it's because the Asian men will be angry, it's because the white women can't be replaced, and the American propaganda is around white women with white men, white women with other race, white women against white men for the other race of men, white women in everything.<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>1&#124;0<br/><br/>0&#124;0<br/><br/>Opinion Owner<br/><br/>1mo<br/><br/>All the excuses of media and propaganda and all lies for racism, jealousy and hate aren't used against white women by the same men who invent the excuses, white women all the time in the media, understand, the American social engineering is made by democrats, democrats hate white men, and the most popular couples would be white men and Asian women but it's horrible for a few group of white racists who are racists even against Asians, is bad for the angry Asian men and their excuses, is bad for the white women, the democrats really don't like white men and work hard to try to make the couple and anything wiht white men and non-white women be related to bad things while pushing white women and non-white men. It's a American political problem.<br/><br/>I think it's a opression against the ego of the men of other race, so the white guys need to look bad, be some sort of jokes, be soft, while the scenes with white women and other race is the opposite of the scenes of white men and non-white women | Lo que dicen los hombres 19<br/><br/>No, es porque los productores de entretenimiento y los vendedores de productos quieren actores/actrices y modelos que se parezcan a la mayoría de la audiencia, para que sean herramientas de ventas identificables y, por lo tanto, más efectivas. Estoy seguro de que las mujeres asiáticas se ven maravillosas para los hombres asiáticos. Para mí, como hombre blanco, tienen cero atractivo.<br/><br/>Soy 100% heterosexual. No salgo de mi raza. Cuando era soldado tuve la experiencia de "te amo desde hace mucho tiempo" en Asia. Eso me ha hecho sentir incómoda cada vez que hay mujeres asiáticas cerca de mí. A veces me siento profundamente incómodo, a pesar de que los individuos particulares no han hecho nada para merecerlo. Durante una visita a Tailandia, me di cuenta de que la única manera de evitar que me hicieran proposiciones en la calle era llevar a una mujer blanca conmigo como cuidadora.<br/><br/>Ah, la cosa es que no hay mucha gente blanca (o ninguna) en China, pero en lugares "blancos", (o al menos en Australia) hay bastantes asiáticos por ahí, lo que me hizo pensar en esta pregunta ...<br/><br/>Tal vez en partes del país donde te quedas (recuerda, pájaros de una pluma...), al igual que para los republicanos, parece que la mayoría de la gente es republicana, etc. Aunque solo puede ser una pequeña minoría la que te rodea.<br/><br/>Y por lo que sé, hay muchos blancos en China, principalmente por negocios, etc. Pero es simple, la mayoría de las personas son asiáticas, por lo que prefieren las chicas asiáticas (perros como perros, gatos como gatos, la mayoría de las personas prefieren su propio tipo). Y no hay nada de malo en eso, lo mismo ocurre en los países blancos.<br/><br/>Creo que los asiáticos son los más bellos. Desafortunadamente para mí, los 2 con los que me involucré en mi vida uno me estaba usando para mi lugar / Internet hace mucho tiempo y el reciente fue una perra estúpida que cavaba oro. Nunca se graduó de la universidad y tenía 30 años. Sería extremadamente feliz si conociera a una mujer asiática inteligente y linda cerca de mi edad que no fuera una buscadora de oro.<br/><br/>Prettiapathetic sí porque cuando un hombre ama profundamente siempre es bueno contigo en la cama sin importar el tamaño de las tetas o el color de la piel y un hombre real siempre respeta a una chica en todas las relaciones como madre, hermana, esposa, novia, etc.<br/><br/>Como modelo desde la infancia comencé con una compañía llamada Sugar & Spice. Me reclutaron en Japón mientras mi familia estaba estacionada allí.<br/><br/>consigues un trabajo porque van por un cierto aspecto, a quién se dirigen y el área en la que vives.<br/><br/>Tuve que dejar la industria el año pasado por razones de salud. Trabajé con muchos tipos de personas, coreanos, japoneses, chinos, polacos, alemanes, estadounidenses, españoles, árabes. He trabajado con niños, adultos, adolescentes, todas estas etnias.<br/><br/>Soy mitad blanco mitad nativo americano (Lakota), así que les encantó mi aspecto desde una edad temprana. pero hay muchos estándares de belleza en la industria y no todos son como se representan, algunos se ven peor, y algunos no se toman lo suficientemente en serio ...<br/><br/>No, es porque los hombres asiáticos están celosos y enojados e inventan miles de excusas cada vez que tienen mujeres asiáticas en los medios porque están celosas de las mujeres asiáticas, y los estadounidenses quieren mantener el estatus de mujeres blancas, esta es la razón por la que las parejas entre mujeres asiáticas y hombres blancos son boicoteadas y todas las demás razas con mujeres blancas son empujadas, son mujeres blancas con otras razas en los medios estadounidenses, ya que es la opresión de las mujeres blancas. Necesitas entender la ingeniería social política estadounidense a lo largo de estos años de medios, demócratas, política y propaganda.<br/><br/>De todos modos, en países como China, Japón, Corea solo tienen hombres asiáticos y mujeres asiáticas y las únicas excepciones son cuando importan una mujer blanca para hacer alguna escena de fantasía para ellos, pero no es tanto, está prohibido exponer el odio y los celos de algunos hombres asiáticos.<br/><br/>Los chicos asiáticos serán felices si dices algo contra otros hombres, pero se enojarán si dices que la chica asiática morirá por la cita rubia con el guapo tipo caucásico / blanco, tratarán de obligar a las mujeres asiáticas a hacer que cualquier cosa contra estos hombres a este pequeño grupo vocal de hombres asiáticos se sienta mejor en su odio, excusas, racismo y celos. Esta es la razón por la que las mujeres asiáticas no se muestran tanto, es porque los hombres asiáticos se enojarán, es porque las mujeres blancas no pueden ser reemplazadas, y la propaganda estadounidense está alrededor de mujeres blancas con hombres blancos, mujeres blancas con otra raza, mujeres blancas contra hombres blancos para la otra raza de hombres, mujeres blancas en todo.<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>1 a 0<br/><br/>0-0<br/><br/>Propietario de opinión<br/><br/>1 mes<br/><br/>Todas las excusas de los medios y la propaganda y todas las mentiras para el racismo, los celos y el odio no son utilizadas contra las mujeres blancas por los mismos hombres que inventan las excusas, las mujeres blancas todo el tiempo en los medios, entiendo, la ingeniería social estadounidense es hecha por demócratas, los demócratas odian a los hombres blancos, y las parejas más populares serían hombres blancos y mujeres asiáticas, pero es horrible para un pequeño grupo de blancos racistas que son racistas incluso contra los asiáticos. Es un problema político estadounidense.<br/><br/>Creo que es una opresión contra el ego de los hombres de otra raza, por lo que los hombres blancos deben verse mal, ser una especie de broma, ser suaves, mientras que las escenas con mujeres blancas y otras razas son lo opuesto a las escenas de hombres blancos y mujeres no blancas. |
