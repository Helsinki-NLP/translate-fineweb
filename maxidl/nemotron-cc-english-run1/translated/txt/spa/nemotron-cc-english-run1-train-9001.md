| UNDERSTANDING SELF-EXECUTING TREATIES VIA STATE PRACTICE<br/><br/>Updated: Feb 2<br/><br/>Introduction:<br/><br/>Consider this paradox, when a country ratifies a treaty, it is said to have consented to accept the treaty in its entirety (reservations and declarations being exceptions); but in some cases, the countries go ahead and refuse to adhere to its provisions. For example, Article VI, Clause 2 of the American Constitution has the provisions that "all treaties … shall be the supreme Law of the Land." Although it is evident that treaties on their own do not have the same effect as federal laws. In truth, they only become operational once these provisions come into force as Federal law with Senate and Presidential approval. Although this is the practice, it is a generally accepted principle in international law that certain treaties have a binding effect on countries. The treaty must fulfil the requirement of being a self-executing treaty to affect the country without any corresponding domestic legislature directly.<br/><br/>This raises the question as to which treaty will qualify as "self-executing" and which will not?<br/><br/>Whether a treaty is a self-executing treaty or not is decided by national judges on a case-to-case basis (Buergenthal, 1992). In order to understand this, the paper will first look at the two types of theories followed by countries on the nature of treaties applying to domestic law. These two theories are monism and dualism. They basically view the framework of domestic and international law as a single hierarchy and two separate hierarchies, respectively (Wildhaber, 1971). Countries following monism believe that certain treaties immediately are binding and immediately have an effect on the country. Once the treaty has been ratified, it can be invoked in national courts and is considered to be a part of the law of the country. Countries following dualism believe that a treaty does not affect domestic law until it has been reinforced by a legislature passed in the parliament. An example of dualism is how the European Convention on Human Rights became operational in the United Kingdom after passing the Human Rights Act 1998 in their parliament (Laws, 2000).<br/><br/>International law is diverse, and so are the types of procedures different countries follow for the acceptance of treaties. Some constitutions' themselves mention the procedures for the ratification of a treaty. Some countries even have different treatment given to international treaty law and customary international law. Certain international organizations like the European Union often affect the domestic law of its member states. The member states of the European Union have to give effect to certain forms of community legislature. Although, it has an essential difference from self-executing treaties. The difference is that it is not for national judges to decide whether the provisions are self-executing or not, but rather for the European Court of Justice to interpret under its constitutive treaties. Other forms of international law formed via resolutions or such might not have the same effect for these states. Nevertheless, they might consider them as forms of "soft law" and look into them to interpret the intent of the law. Sometimes, proclamations made by the judicial organs of international organizations such as the Inter-American Court of Human Rights affect their member states. Although these proclamations are not binding on the member states, the national judges seem to refer to these for authoritative interpretation.<br/><br/>Therefore, a case-to-case approach must be taken while analyzing the procedures and precedents set in different countries. To examine the concept of self-executing treaties, this paper will compare the precedents set by different jurisdictions. If the reader wishes to conduct a similar analysis, they can do so by looking into the different national yearbooks on international law. Mostly, these yearbooks will have a section devoted to the relationship between international and national law.<br/><br/>International Jurisprudence:<br/><br/>The most significant issue that comes up for national courts is whether the treaty is self-executing? If the treaty can be applied without any additional domestic legislature having passed to reinforce it. This question came up in the case of Czesław S v State Treasury and Minister of the State Treasury, wherein the Polish Constitutional Court held that since the treaty provisions referred to domestic measures to be taken, the treaty was not self-executing in nature (Bug river claims, Czesław S v State Treasury and Minister of the State Treasury, 2003). Essentially, when the treaty refers to domestic measures to be taken, it does not in itself create new obligations. It instead reinforces the treaty's intent for the domestic legal process to take measures for the same. A similar issue was raised in the Sosa case in the United States of America. In this case, the court considered whether the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights was a self-executing treaty. The American Supreme Court has also declared that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is not a self-executing treaty (Court, 2004). The Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland also examined the self-executing nature of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The issue before the court was whether Article 13(2)(b) and (c) were self-executing in nature. The court examined whether the treaty was partially self-executing and did so by checking whether there existed a minimum core content for the treaty to be applicable. The court held that it found no such provision within the treaty (A and B v Government of the Canton of Zurich, 2000).<br/><br/>It is essential to understand that these issues differ from the fundamental question of whether international law can be applied as part of the law of the land? In order to answer this question, the paper will examine the judgement by the Supreme Court of the Dominican Republic. The Supreme Court stated that Article 3 of the Dominican Republic's Constitution made international law binding on the domestic legal order. The court rejected the Superior Land Court's interpretation that these treaties were "foreign legislature" and not part of the domestic legal order. The Supreme Court laid down that all treaties ratified by the Dominican Republic formed a part of Dominican Law and, therefore, can be termed as self-executing (Gallardo Montilla v Gallardo Concepción and ors, 1997). The Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland has examined whether the Libson Treaty was self-executing and directly applicable to Swiss Universities. The court held, "According to relevant case law, a treaty norm is directly applicable if its content is sufficiently precise and clear to form the basis of a decision in a particular case. The norm thus has to be justiciable, i.e. define the rights and obligations of an individual and be directed at the competent authorities" (X v University of Lucerne, 2014). This implies that whether the treaty is directly applicable or not, depends upon on whether the norm is justiciable. The Lisbon Treaty is based on the principle of qualifications acquired aboard. This is conveyed through Article IV (1) of the treaty. The purpose of this was to create an obligation for states to show that their decision-making process is fair, transparent and non-discriminatory. The responsibility for proving that the applicant has not met the required criteria is on the "body undertaking the assessment." The treaty guarantees procedural safeguards, which are generally accepted by countries and hence, the court held this treaty to be self-executing. This goes on to showcase the different interpretations undertaken by the courts of various countries.<br/><br/>It is essential to observe whether the norms set out by treaties are actually being complied with. The case laws from various jurisdictions have emphasized that national courts are the final authority on the issue of whether a treaty is self-executing. There is also an inherent duty cast on countries for the observance and due performance of treaties. Such is cast by the Pacta Sunt Servanda rule as enshrined within Article 26 of the Vienna Convention on Law of Treaties (VCLT). Article 27 goes on to reinforce it by stating that international law obligations cannot be ignored by using domestic law as a justification. Many countries' courts have used this as a source of interpretation, such as the Latvian Constitutional Court. In the case of a national norm conflicting with an international norm, the court held that the national norm was null and void. To reach its conclusion, the court strongly relied on the necessary performance of treaties in good faith as envisaged in Article 26 of the VCLT (Linija v Latvia, 2004).<br/><br/>Conclusion:<br/><br/>From the above, it is clear that treaties have particular requirements before they can be considered self-executing. However, keeping all of these aside, the most important still remains the national courts' interpretation. The national courts decide whether the treaty can be called self-executing or not. Although their Constitution's might contain a provision regarding treaty law being the supreme law of the land, courts from different countries interpret these provisions in different manners. This can be seen as to how the American and Dominican Constitutions' both contain these provisions but follow completely different interpretations of the same. The term "self-executing" may not be congruous for these treaties since, in practice, they still need approval from the national courts. Ideally, the way forward should be that countries acknowledge the self-executing nature of treaties and treat them in a fashion wherein Article 26 and 27 of the VCLT are respected. Again, this is the "ideal" situation and is not likely to find its way into state practice of certain jurisdictions anytime soon. Still, hope can be gained via looking into the interpretations of national courts that respect these norms and hopefully pave the way for other courts to acknowledge this.<br/><br/>References:<br/><br/>Buergenthal, T.

Por ejemplo, el Artículo VI, Cláusula 2 de la Constitución Americana tiene las disposiciones que "todos los tratados ... serán la ley suprema de la Tierra." Aunque es evidente que los tratados por sí solos no tienen el mismo efecto que las leyes federales. En verdad, sólo entran en funcionamiento una vez que estas disposiciones entran en vigor como ley federal con la aprobación del Senado y el Presidente. Aunque esta es la práctica, es un principio generalmente aceptado en el derecho internacional que ciertos tratados tienen un efecto vinculante en los países. El tratado debe cumplir el requisito de ser un tratado de auto-ejecución para afectar al país sin ninguna legislación nacional correspondiente directamente.<br/><br/>Esto plantea la cuestión de qué tratado se considerará "autoejecutable" y cuál no.<br/><br/>Si un tratado es un tratado de autoejecución o no es decidido por jueces nacionales caso por caso (Buergenthal, 1992). Para entender esto, el documento analizará primero los dos tipos de teorías seguidas por los países sobre la naturaleza de los tratados que se aplican al derecho interno. Estas dos teorías son el monismo y el dualismo. Básicamente ven el marco del derecho nacional e internacional como una sola jerarquía y dos jerarquías separadas, respectivamente (Wildhaber, 1971). Los países que siguen el monismo creen que ciertos tratados son vinculantes y tienen un efecto inmediato en el país. Una vez que el tratado ha sido ratificado, puede ser invocado en los tribunales nacionales y se considera que es parte de la ley del país. Los países que siguen el dualismo creen que un tratado no afecta el derecho interno hasta que haya sido reforzado por una legislatura pasada en el parlamento. Un ejemplo de dualismo es cómo el Convenio Europeo de Derechos Humanos entró en funcionamiento en el Reino Unido después de aprobar la Ley de Derechos Humanos de 1998 en su parlamento (Leyes, 2000).<br/><br/>El derecho internacional es diverso, y también lo son los tipos de procedimientos que siguen los diferentes países para la aceptación de los tratados. Algunos países incluso tienen un trato diferente dado al derecho internacional convencional y al derecho internacional consuetudinario. Ciertas organizaciones internacionales como la Unión Europea a menudo afectan el derecho interno de sus Estados miembros. Los Estados miembros de la Unión Europea tienen que dar efecto a ciertas formas de legislación comunitaria, aunque tiene una diferencia esencial con los tratados de autoejecución. La diferencia es que no corresponde a los jueces nacionales decidir si las disposiciones son autoejecutables o no, sino más bien al Tribunal de Justicia Europeo interpretarlas en virtud de sus tratados constitutivos. Otras formas de derecho internacional formadas a través de resoluciones o similares podrían no tener el mismo efecto para estos estados, sin embargo, podrían considerarlas como formas de "derecho blando" y considerarlas para interpretar la intención de la ley. A veces, las proclamaciones hechas por los órganos judiciales de organizaciones internacionales como la Corte Interamericana de Derechos Humanos afectan a sus Estados miembros. Aunque estas proclamaciones no son vinculantes para los Estados miembros, los jueces nacionales parecen referirse a ellas para una interpretación autorizada.<br/><br/>Por lo tanto, se debe tomar un enfoque caso por caso al analizar los procedimientos y precedentes establecidos en diferentes países. Para examinar el concepto de tratados de autoejecución, este documento comparará los precedentes establecidos por diferentes jurisdicciones. Si el lector desea realizar un análisis similar, puede hacerlo examinando los diferentes anuarios nacionales sobre derecho internacional. En su mayoría, estos anuarios tendrán una sección dedicada a la relación entre el derecho internacional y el derecho nacional.<br/><br/>Jurisprudencia Internacional:<br/><br/>La cuestión más importante que se plantea a los tribunales nacionales es si el tratado es de autoejecución, si el tratado puede aplicarse sin que se haya aprobado ninguna legislación nacional adicional para reforzarlo. Esta cuestión surgió en el caso de Czeslaw S/Tesorería del Estado y Ministro del Tesoro del Estado, en el que el Tribunal Constitucional polaco sostuvo que, dado que las disposiciones del tratado se referían a las medidas internas que debían adoptarse, el tratado no era de naturaleza autoejecutable (reclamaciones Bug river, Czeslaw S/Tesorería del Estado y Ministro del Tesoro del Estado, 2003). Esencialmente, cuando el tratado se refiere a las medidas internas que deben adoptarse, no crea por sí mismo nuevas obligaciones, sino que refuerza la intención del tratado de que el proceso jurídico interno adopte medidas para el mismo. Una cuestión similar se planteó en el caso Sosa en los Estados Unidos de América, en el que el tribunal examinó si el Pacto Internacional de Derechos Civiles y Políticos era un tratado de autoejecución. La Corte Suprema de los Estados Unidos también ha declarado que el Pacto Internacional de Derechos Civiles y Políticos no es un tratado de autoejecución (Tribunal, 2004). El Tribunal Supremo Federal de Suiza examinó también el carácter autoejecutivo del Pacto Internacional de Derechos Civiles y Políticos y examinó si el artículo 13, apartado 2, letras b) y c), era autoejecutable. El tribunal examinó si el tratado era parcialmente autoejecutable y lo hizo comprobando si existía un contenido básico mínimo para que el tratado fuera aplicable. El tribunal sostuvo que no había ninguna disposición de ese tipo en el marco del tratado (A y B contra Gobierno del Cantón de Zúrich, 2000).<br/><br/>Es esencial entender que estas cuestiones difieren de la cuestión fundamental de si el derecho internacional puede aplicarse como parte del derecho de la tierra. Para responder a esta pregunta, el documento examinará la sentencia de la Corte Suprema de la República Dominicana. La Corte Suprema declaró que el artículo 3 de la Constitución de la República Dominicana hacía que el derecho internacional fuera vinculante para el orden jurídico interno. El tribunal rechazó la interpretación del Tribunal de Tierras Superior que estos tratados eran "legislativa extranjera" y no la parte del pedido judicial doméstico. El Tribunal Supremo estableció que todos los tratados ratificados por la República Dominicana formaban parte del derecho dominicano y, por lo tanto, podían calificarse de autoejecutables (Gallardo Montilla / Gallardo Concepción y Ors, 1997). El Tribunal Supremo Federal de Suiza ha examinado si el Tratado Libson era de autoejecución y directamente aplicable a las universidades suizas. De acuerdo con la jurisprudencia pertinente, una norma de un tratado es directamente aplicable si su contenido es lo suficientemente preciso y claro como para formar la base de una decisión en un caso particular. Por lo tanto, la norma debe ser justiciable, es decir, definir los derechos y obligaciones de una persona y dirigirse a las autoridades competentes" (X / Universidad de Lucerna, 2014). Esto implica que si el tratado es directamente aplicable o no, depende de si la norma es justiciable. El Tratado de Lisboa se basa en el principio de cualificaciones adquiridas a bordo. Esto se transmite a través del Artículo IV (1) del tratado. El propósito de esto era crear una obligación para que los Estados demuestren que su proceso de toma de decisiones es justo, transparente y no discriminatorio. La responsabilidad de probar que el solicitante no ha cumplido con los criterios requeridos recae en el "organismo que realiza la evaluación". El tratado garantiza garantías procesales generalmente aceptadas por los países y, por lo tanto, el tribunal consideró que este tratado era de autoejecución, lo que demuestra las diferentes interpretaciones realizadas por los tribunales de varios países.<br/><br/>Es esencial observar si se están cumpliendo efectivamente las normas establecidas en los tratados. Las leyes jurisprudenciales de diversas jurisdicciones han hecho hincapié en que los tribunales nacionales son la autoridad final sobre la cuestión de si un tratado se aplica por sí solo. También existe un deber inherente a los países para la observancia y el debido cumplimiento de los tratados, tal como lo establece la norma Pacta Sunt Servanda consagrada en el artículo 26 de la Convención de Viena sobre el Derecho de los Tratados (VCLT). El artículo 27 lo refuerza afirmando que las obligaciones de derecho internacional no pueden ignorarse utilizando el derecho interno como justificación, ya que muchos tribunales de países lo han utilizado como fuente de interpretación, como el Tribunal Constitucional de Letonia. En el caso de una norma nacional en conflicto con una norma internacional, el tribunal sostuvo que la norma nacional era nula de pleno derecho. Para llegar a su conclusión, el tribunal se basó firmemente en el cumplimiento necesario de los tratados de buena fe, tal como se prevé en el artículo 26 del VCLT (Linija c. Letonia, 2004).<br/><br/>Conclusión:<br/><br/>De lo anterior se desprende claramente que los tratados tienen requisitos particulares antes de que puedan considerarse de autoejecución; sin embargo, dejando todo esto a un lado, lo más importante sigue siendo la interpretación de los tribunales nacionales. Los tribunales nacionales deciden si el tratado puede llamarse autoejecutable o no. Aunque su Constitución podría contener una disposición relativa a que el derecho de los tratados es la ley suprema del país, los tribunales de diferentes países interpretan estas disposiciones de diferentes maneras. Esto se puede ver en cuanto a cómo las Constituciones estadounidense y dominicana contienen estas disposiciones, pero siguen interpretaciones completamente diferentes de las mismas. El término "autoejecutable" puede no ser congruente para estos tratados ya que, en la práctica, todavía necesitan la aprobación de los tribunales nacionales. Idealmente, el camino a seguir debería ser que los países reconozcan el carácter autoejecutivo de los tratados y los traten de manera que se respeten los artículos 26 y 27 de la Convención. Una vez más, esta es la situación "ideal" y no es probable que encuentre su camino en la práctica estatal de ciertas jurisdicciones en el corto plazo. Aún así, se puede obtener esperanza examinando las interpretaciones de los tribunales nacionales que respetan estas normas y, con suerte, allanan el camino para que otros tribunales lo reconozcan.<br/><br/>Referencias:<br/><br/>Buergenthal, T.

Whether it is a last-minute job request or a paper that you forgot to write and it is due the next day, stress can always find a way into your day if you allow it. Today I will show you a few things you can do to eliminate or prevent stress.<br/><br/>The first thing you can do is to exercise. Exercising is a great way to relieve stress because it lowers the stress hormone in your body known as cortisol. The lower levels of cortisol in your body, the lower your stress level will be. Exercise can also increase your confidence, and when your confidence is up then your stress is usually down. For me, when I get stressed, I always exercise by going to the gym and practice boxing, it helps me burn calories and reduce stress while having fun.<br/><br/>Writing things down has been a way to calm people down for a very long time, and it is the next topic on our list. Writing down what is making you stressed is a way to clear the mind, and it helps get rid of stress as well. I have a similar experience when writing stories, usually if I cannot think of a new idea because of an old one, I will write the old idea down and think on it. That is when new ideas start to spring up and I can continue writing normally. It is the same with stress. Think about a stream it continues to flow down it's path until it hits a beaver dam, and that dam blocks the flow of water and everything starts to build up. The only way to get the water flow back to normal is to remove the dam. This is where writing comes in. When you write it down, you are removing stress piece by piece until you can think normally again.<br/><br/>Stress can come into our lives through doors in our life that we keep open. Procrastination is a way that we can leave the doors open for stress. Waiting until tomorrow may be fun for today, but it will hurt you tomorrow, and is a very short-sighted solution. The longer you wait to do something, the larger that something becomes, and the larger it becomes the more stress you will be inviting into your life. Taking care of something as soon as we receive it is a great way to prevent stress, but it is something that takes great discipline to do. The more you cut Procrastination out of your life, the more stress free you will be. So shut that door, you're letting all the cold air out.<br/><br/>So let's review: Exercise, Write down what is stressing you, and Do not Procrastinate. These are only a few ways to relieve stress but to me, they are the most effective. While I know these may not work for everyone I would like to invite anyone feeling stressed to research how to get rid of it. | BLOGS<br/><br/>Echa un vistazo a nuestra colección de blogs escritos por otros miembros del personal.<br/><br/>BLOGS INFORMATIVOS<br/><br/>No lo estreses<br/><br/>por<br/>Kristen Hogan<br/>12 de nov. de 2020<br/><br/>Estrés, no importa lo bien que vayan las cosas, siempre puede encontrar una manera de levantar su fea cabeza. Ya sea una solicitud de trabajo de último minuto o un papel que se olvidó de escribir y se debe al día siguiente, el estrés siempre puede encontrar una manera en su día si lo permite. Hoy te voy a mostrar algunas cosas que puedes hacer para eliminar o prevenir el estrés.<br/><br/>Lo primero que puede hacer es hacer ejercicio. Hacer ejercicio es una excelente manera de aliviar el estrés porque reduce la hormona del estrés en su cuerpo conocida como cortisol. Cuantos más bajos sean los niveles de cortisol en su cuerpo, menor será su nivel de estrés. El ejercicio también puede aumentar su confianza, y cuando su confianza aumenta, su estrés generalmente disminuye. Para mí, cuando me estreso, siempre hago ejercicio yendo al gimnasio y practicando boxeo, me ayuda a quemar calorías y reducir el estrés mientras me divierto.<br/><br/>Escribir las cosas ha sido una forma de calmar a la gente durante mucho tiempo, y es el siguiente tema en nuestra lista. Escribir lo que te está estresando es una forma de despejar la mente, y también ayuda a deshacerse del estrés. Tengo una experiencia similar cuando escribo historias, por lo general, si no puedo pensar en una idea nueva debido a una vieja, escribiré la vieja idea y pensaré en ella. Es entonces cuando comienzan a surgir nuevas ideas y puedo continuar escribiendo normalmente. Es lo mismo con el estrés. Piensa en una corriente que continúa fluyendo por su camino hasta que golpea una presa de castor, y esa presa bloquea el flujo de agua y todo comienza a acumularse. La única manera de hacer que el flujo de agua vuelva a la normalidad es quitar la presa. Aquí es donde entra la escritura. Cuando la escribes, estás eliminando el estrés pieza por pieza hasta que puedas volver a pensar normalmente.<br/><br/>El estrés puede entrar en nuestras vidas a través de puertas en nuestras vidas que mantenemos abiertas. La dilación es una forma en que podemos dejar las puertas abiertas para el estrés. Esperar hasta mañana puede ser divertido para hoy, pero mañana te hará daño, y es una solución muy miope. Cuanto más esperes para hacer algo, más grande será ese algo, y cuanto más grande se vuelva, más estrés invitarás a tu vida. Cuidar algo tan pronto como lo recibimos es una excelente manera de prevenir el estrés, pero es algo que requiere una gran disciplina. Cuanto más elimines la procrastinación de tu vida, más libre de estrés estarás. Así que cierra esa puerta, estás dejando salir todo el aire frío.<br/><br/>Así que repasemos: Haga ejercicio, anote lo que lo está estresando y no procrastine. Estas son solo algunas formas de aliviar el estrés, pero para mí, son las más efectivas. Aunque sé que esto puede no funcionar para todos, me gustaría invitar a cualquier persona que se sienta estresada a investigar cómo deshacerse de él. |
