| Smith Chuck - Through the Bible C2000 SeriesShall we turn to the book of Acts, chapter one, as we begin our study of the early church.<br/>Luke, the author of the book of Acts, a companion of Paul the apostle, who was author also of the Gospel According to Luke, wrote these two treatises to a friend, Theophilus. Theophilus is a Greek name. It's a name that has a beautiful meaning. The name means lover of God. There are some who believe that it was not a man at all, but that the gospel and the book of Acts were addressed to the lovers of God, whoever you may be. There are other traditions that say that Theophilus was actually Luke's master. That in those days physicians were slaves, usually the slave of a wealthy patron. So that Luke's master was Theophilus, and he released Luke to be with Paul on the missionary journeys. Thus, Luke is writing back to his former master. This is an early tradition of the church, but it is, of course, impossible to prove, like so many of the traditions.<br/>There are also those who believe that when Paul was in Troas and he received a vision of a man calling unto him saying, "Come over to Macedonia and help us," that that man in Paul's vision was none other than Luke. For the first one that Paul really met when he came to Macedonia was Luke. And as we are in the book of Acts, you will find that when we get to that portion of the book of Acts, Luke begins to write more in the first person rather than the third person. So it is, evidently, at this particular point in the Acts of the Apostles that Luke became a companion of Paul and began to journey with him. He began to use the pronouns "we" and "us" instead of "they" and "them." This is, no doubt, where Luke became a participant and an eyewitness of those things that were happening from this point on. We will bring this out to you when we get to that point.<br/>He begins the Acts of the Apostles by tying it with the Gospel According to Luke. It is interesting that the very last thing that Luke records in his gospel is the very first thing he records in the Acts of the Apostles. We find the gospel of Luke closing as Jesus is telling His disciples to wait in Jerusalem until they be endued with power from on high. And then Jesus ascended up into heaven, and so he closes the gospel. In opening the Acts of the Apostles, he writes,<br/>The former treatise [that is, the Gospel According to Luke,] have I written unto you, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and teach ( Act 1:1 ),<br/>The key word is began. The Gospel According to Luke is not the full story of the ministry of Jesus Christ. It is only the beginning of the ministry of Jesus Christ. Jesus continues to minister to the needs of people. Jesus continues to heal the sick. Jesus continues to raise the dead. Jesus continues to minister His love and His gospel to the world, only now He is ministering through those disciples who have been anointed with His Holy Spirit. But the ministry of Christ is continuing; basically, is the premise that Luke takes in the Acts of the Apostles. The former treatise of all that Jesus began, both to do and to teach.<br/>Now because of that, the Acts of the Apostles is an unfinished book: in that the Lord today continues to work through the lives of those who have dedicated themselves to be the instruments of God. To be led and guided and anointed by His Holy Spirit, to continue the ministry of Jesus in the world today. Now God has ordained that His work should be accomplished through human instruments. I do not say that it must be accomplished. God can use angelic beings for His work, and there will come a time, during the book of Revelation when God will use angels to proclaim His gospel to people all over the world. Revelation, chapter 14, "The first angel flying through the midst of heaven having the everlasting gospel" ( Rev 14:6 ). But at the present time, God has chosen to use human instruments. As imperfect as they may be, yet that's what God has ordained to use. The exciting thing about that is, God will use me and God will use you. So many times, we're begging off, "O Lord, I can't speak. I've never been able to speak before or even now, Lord." As Moses tried to beg off the call of God. Jeremiah said, "Lord, I'm just a kid; no one's going to listen to me." And we all have our excuses why we can't be used. Don't we? We all know the reasons why God couldn't use us.<br/>One time, as the Lord was calling a prophet to do His work, he said, "Lord, send whoever you want." The Lord said, "Hey, I've called you." "Lord, good idea; send whoever you want." So often we're in that position, "Lord, send by the hand of whomsoever you will, anybody but me Lord." And yet, God has ordained to use us.<br/>Now, each of us can show our own imperfections. Each of us can point out our own inabilities, and all of us can find an excuse why God wouldn't want to use me. But yet, God has chosen to use you. That through your life He might reveal Himself to a needy world. You wonder when God has such instruments to use how He ever got the job done, don't you?<br/>Until the day in which he was taken up, after that he through the Holy Spirit had given commandments to the apostles whom he had chosen ( Act 1:2 ):<br/>That is what he ended the Gospel of Luke with. The day that Jesus was taken up, after He had told the apostles to wait for the endowment of power.<br/>To whom he also [that is the apostles he also] showed himself alive to them after his passion [or death] by many infallible proofs ( Act 1:3 ),<br/>It is difficult to deny the fact of the resurrection of Jesus Christ. I was amused, as well as annoyed and irritated, by an article I read in the Santa Ana Register this last Saturday. Of the creation science and evolutionary theories being presented in the county schools. How that, this one professor said that he teaches a science class, and thus, they deal only in facts, and that they don't have any place for theories. Because science is based upon fact and creation is based upon religious superstitions. It takes a lot of faith to believe the religious theories. When you are dealing with facts, you can just accept them. I thought, "Very interesting in that science class, they taught me it was a fact that the world was four billion years old. Now today they are teaching it's a fact that the world is twelve billion years old. And it wasn't that long ago that I went to school."<br/>It's interesting that the Bible has never needed to be revised or updated to meet the current data that men have discovered. And yet, if you would take my high school science textbooks today and try to teach a science class from them, you would find that many of the things that were taught as scientific fact when I was in high school are no longer recognized as scientific fact. The simple cell protoplasm is no longer a simple cell, but extremely complex. If there is any fact that can be attested to in history it is the fact of the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.<br/>We have a jurisprudence system that is based upon the testimony of witnesses. If a man is accused of a crime and there are people who witnessed that crime while it was being committed, and they are brought to the standard, and they swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help them God. And in their questioning they affirm that, "I saw that man in the bank on May twenty-third. I saw him pull out a gun from his coat. I heard him demand that all of the money be given to him. I saw him as he left the bank. I saw him as the officer apprehended him outside." And if you can get three or four witnesses to point to that man and will keep their testimony under cross-examination, that man is judged to be guilty. He is the one who did it. We have two or three witnesses that are testifying the same story about that man, and it is accepted as fact that he is the one who perpetrated the crime and is guilty. You've got witnesses who have sworn to tell the truth that are verifying.<br/>After the death of Jesus, when He rose again, He appeared unto many different people who gave sworn testimony that they saw Him. That they talked to Him, that He appeared to them in various places under different circumstances. And for a period of forty days was visiting with them. And at one time, up to as many as five hundred people who were gathered at one place, He appeared. It's difficult to just cast aside or deny the witness of these people. To do so is to discredit our whole jurisprudence system. But not only that, these men who testified that they saw the risen Lord, that they talked to Him, that they ate with Him, they, all of them, with the exception of one, met violent deaths at the hands of other people because of their affirming that the story they told was true. You talk about witnesses sworn to tell the truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth. If a person's life was threatened because of that witness, and it was a lie, at least one them would've broken under the pressure. They would've confessed to the entire hoax. "He showed Himself alive after His passion by many infallible proofs."<br/>being seen of them for forty days, speaking to them of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God ( Act 1:3 ):<br/>Sometimes we fault the disciples because of their questions of the timing of the kingdom of God. Let it be remembered that the kingdom of God was the favorite subject of Jesus Christ. He was always talking about the kingdom of God, and it is a great hope that He was planting into the hearts of all men. Things are not always going to continue corrupted as they are. The world is not going to go forever under the power of darkness, under the bondage of evil. God is going to one day establish His kingdom upon the earth. A kingdom of righteous joy and peace. "Jesus shall reign, where ere the sun doth her successive journeys run. And His kingdom will extend from shore to shore." And that day will be the most glorious day the world has ever seen, as sickness and suffering and pain will be abolished in His kingdom. As sin and greed and these things that have made the world such an intolerable place will be abolished in His kingdom. The godless commercialism, the exploitation of man, all of these things abolished in His glorious kingdom when He reigns. No wonder the disciples were anxious to get it on. I'm anxious to get it on; I'm anxious for His kingdom to come. And Jesus told us when we pray, the first petition is, "Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven" ( Mat 6:10 ). This is the right kind of a desire that we should all have. I desire the kingdom of God. And so He was talking to them, during this forty-day period, of the kingdom.<br/>And, being assembled together with them, he commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which, saith he, you have heard of me ( Act 1:4 ).<br/>He said, "Now look, wait here in Jerusalem until you receive the promise of the Father." This promise that He is referring to is, no doubt, the promise in Joel where the Lord promised, "And it shall come to pass in the later days, saith the Lord, that I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and daughters will prophesy, and your young men shall dream dreams, your old men shall see visions: and upon my servants and my handmaidens shall I pour out my Spirit, saith the Lord" ( Joe 2:28-29 ). The promise of the Father: the day is going to come when God is going to pour out His Spirit upon all flesh, all of the believers. They will, each one, receive that dynamic from God.<br/>For John [He said,] truly baptized with water; but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now ( Act 1:5 ).<br/>The idea of baptism was that of emersion, the bapteedzo. John baptized with water, submerged the people in water, "you're going to be submerged in the Holy Spirit in not many days."<br/>Now when they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, will you at this time restore the kingdom to Israel? ( Act 1:6 )<br/>"When is it going to be, Lord? When's the time for this restoration?" And Jesus is talking to them now, not about the kingdom, but about the power that they're going to receive for service. And so He brushes aside their question.<br/>Saying unto them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father has put in his own power ( Act 1:7 ).<br/>"It's not for you to know." They lived constantly in the anticipation of the immediate setting up of the kingdom. During the entire lifetime of Jesus, they were expecting Him at any moment to go into the phone booth and come out as the savior of the world. Shazzam! Showing His power and overthrowing the governments of the world, establishing God's kingdom upon the earth. And they were waiting daily for this change to transpire. And whenever Jesus would talk about going to Jerusalem, being turned over into the hands of sinful man, and then being crucified, "Oh, oh no, Lord. No, no you don't understand the kingdom, Lord. Be that far from Thee." When Jesus died on the cross, they were all greatly disappointed.<br/>The two disciples on the road to Emmaus, so sad. "Hey, fellows. How come you're so sad as your walking along?" "What do you mean? You must be a stranger around here if you don't know the things that have been happening lately in Jerusalem." "What things?" "Oh, a fellow by the name of Jesus of Nazareth...oh man, it was mighty and powerful. The anointing of God was upon His life. We had hoped that in Him was the deliverance of Israel, but they crucified Him. We had hoped . . . now it's dead." Now He's risen, and He's saying, "In a few days, fellows, you're going to receive the promise of the Father." "Oh, what promise? The promise of the establishing of the kingdom?" You see, it was legitimate that they should ask. "Is this it Lord? Alright! Is this the time? Are you going to set up your kingdom now?" "No. It's not for you to know those times that the Father's appointed or that the Father has in His own power. But, you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you."<br/>Now here, the Greek preposition epi is used to signify a new relationship that they were to have with the Holy Spirit. In the Gospel According to John, chapter 14, as Jesus is there promising to send the Holy Spirit, He said, "I will not leave you comfortless. I will come to you, and I will pray the Father, and He will send to you another comforter, even the Spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth Him not neither knows Him, but you know Him for He dwells with you, and He shall be in you" ( Joh 14:17-18 ). Same Greek preposition as ours, only they spell it "en" instead of "in." Two-fold relationship there in John: He is with you, but He's going to be dwelling in you. But now Jesus said you're going to receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you. The Greek preposition epi, which is translated in different texts throughout the New Testament as "upon" or "over" or I like it, "overflows."<br/>In the seventh chapter of the gospel of John: "On the last day, the great day of the feast when Jesus stood there on the Temple Mount and cried to the people, 'If any man thirst let him come unto Me and drink: and he who drinks of the water that I give, out of his innermost being there will gush torrents of living water.'" John said, "This spake He of the Spirit, which was not yet given which they who believe on Him should receive" ( Joh 7:37-39 ). What did He speak of the Spirit? That it would be like a torrent of living water flowing out. I like, "When the Spirit overflows you," upon you, or over you, or overflows from you. So the three-fold relationship: He is with you prior to your conversion, He is the one who causes you to realize that you are a sinner, He is the one who points to Jesus Christ as the answer as He convinces the world of sin, of righteous, and of judgment. The moment you open your life and heart to Jesus Christ and invite Him to come in, the Holy Spirit comes and begins to indwell you. He shall be in you. "Know ye not that you are not your own, you have been bought with a price, therefore glorify God in your body and your spirit which are His. And know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit which is in you? Be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess, but be filled, or be ye being filled with the Spirit" ( 1Co 6:19-20 ,Eph 5:18 ). But now here's a third relationship. This is an empowering experience.<br/>You will receive [the dunamus] the dynamics, when the Holy Spirit has come [epi] upon you [or over you, or when there is that overflow from you]: and ye shall be witnesses unto me ( Act 1:8 )<br/>And so the dynamic, to be a witness for Jesus Christ. It is interesting that the word witness in Greek is the word martus from where we get our word martyr. And in Greek it does mean martyr. A witness is one who not only proclaims what he believes, he lives what he believes, he is what he believes, and he believes it so strongly, that if necessary, he'll die for what he believes. That's how strong is his belief. He's a martus. You can't stop him. He's not afraid to die for what he believes.<br/>You remember when Paul was on his way back to Jerusalem and Agabus came down from Caesarea and he took Paul's girdle and tied himself up and he said, "So is the man who owns this girdle to be bound when he gets to Jerusalem." And Paul's friends began to weep, saying, "Oh, Paul, don't go, don't go." And he said, "What do you mean by these tears? Do you think you're going to dissuade me? Do you think I'm worried about being bound? I'm ready to die." He was a martus. "I'm ready to die." Being put to death for your faith did not make you a martyr; because you were a martyr, you were put to death. Because you were a witness, because you believed it so strong. So, it did not make you a witness, it only proved what you were. You were a witness all along. If you hadn't been a martus, you would've never gone to your death. You would've recanted; you would've said, "Whoa, whoa, wait, wait. Hold on, let's change course here. I think that I may have made a mistake." Then you say, "Well, he wasn't a martus. Stealing a horse doesn't make you a horse thief; it only proves that you were. No one steals a horse unless he's a horse thief. So, stealing it doesn't make you a horse thief, it only proves that you were all along. Being martyred only proves what you were a witness, a martus. "And you will be witnesses." And isn't it interesting that most of them were martyred? "Witnesses unto Me."<br/>The witness was to be both in Jerusalem, and in all of Judea ( Act 1:8 ),<br/>The witness began right at home. The hardest place, isn't it? It's to start right at home in Jerusalem, and then the area around Jerusalem, the area of Judea. And then it was to spread up into Samaria. And then it was to go out into the uttermost parts of the world. And as we study the book of Acts, we will see this very progression. How the witness began in Jerusalem. We'll get that in the next chapter. And then we'll see how it began to spread through out Judea. And then Phillip went up into Samaria, and then finally Paul and Barnabas are called to go into the uttermost parts of the world. And so the witness spread through the anointing and the empowering of the Holy Spirit.<br/>Now when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight ( Act 1:9 ).<br/>This is the final promise made by Jesus to His disciples. This is it, the final words prior to His ascension. Of course, later He came and talked to Paul and others, but prior to His ascension, this is His final word. And upon this, when He had spoken these things, while they were watching Him, He was taken up and a cloud received Him out of their sight.<br/>And while they were looking steadfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, there were two men who stood by them in white apparel ( Act 1:10 );<br/>We assume they were angels.<br/>Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as you have seen him go into heaven ( Act 1:11 ).<br/>They saw Him as He ascended up into heaven and they will behold Him when He comes again. "Behold the Lord cometh with ten thousands of His saints, to execute judgement upon the earth" (Jud 1:14-15). And then, "Unto Him who loved us and gave Himself for us and who has made us unto our God, kings and priests who shall reign with Him upon the earth, behold the Lord cometh, and every eye shall see Him, and they also who pierced Him shall mourn" Rev 1:5-7 ). So the Lord's coming. Every eye shall see Him. The Jehovah Witnesses say that He is already come, but it was a secret coming. As it was only the disciples that saw Him go, it was only the disciples, of the Jehovah Witnesses, who saw Him return. But Jesus said, "If they say unto you, 'He has come in secret and has gone into a secret chamber don't believe it'" ( Mat 24:26 ). So you have to choose, to believe Jesus or them.<br/>"This same Jesus which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as you've seen Him go into heaven."<br/>Now there's a very interesting verse in II John, verse Act 1:7 , "For many deceivers are entered into the world who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh." That, unfortunately, is a poor translation of the Greek. For this participle is in the present tense and should be translated "is coming in the flesh." Those who would deny that Jesus Christ is coming in the flesh. What does John say of them? "They are a deceiver and an antichrist. Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward. For whosoever transgresses and abides not in the doctrine of Christ, has not God. He that abides in the doctrine of Christ, he has both the Father and the Son. And if there come any unto your door (on Saturday morning) and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, and neither bid him good-bye. For he that bids him good-bye is a partaker of his evil deeds" (2Jn 1:7-11). Ask them one question, "Is Jesus coming in the flesh?" Just ask them that question. And if they say no, just remember what John warned you and what John told you. "If any confess not that Jesus Christ is coming in the flesh." Do you remember when He was with the disciples and He said, "Give me something to eat"? He said, "You know, spirits don't eat; touch me. See? It's me." So, this same Jesus is coming again in the same manner in which they saw Him go into heaven. And I, for one, believe that that coming is very soon.<br/>Then retuned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a Sabbath's day journey [about two-thirds of a mile]. And when they were come in, they went up into an upper room, where there abode both Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, and Phillip, and Thomas, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon Zelotes, and Judas the brother of James. And these all continued in one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers ( Act 1:12-14 ).<br/>This is the last mention of Mary the mother of Jesus. At this point and from this point on, there is no further mention of her in the Acts of the Apostles or in the epistles. No mention of her death or of her miraculous ascension into heaven, without death. Nothing is mentioned in the scripture. It is silent.<br/>His brethren would be a reference probably to James and to Jude and to those other brothers who were sons of Joseph and Mary.<br/>The upper room--there are some who say that it is the same upper room in which Jesus had the Last Supper with His disciples. And yet, there are others who hold to this upper room being a room in the temple precincts where the early church met. Take your choice.<br/>And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples, and said, (the number of their names together were about one hundred and twenty,) men and brethren, this Scripture must needs have been fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit by the mouth of David spake before concerning Judas, which was a guide to those who took Jesus ( Act 1:15-16 ).<br/>Here again, Peter still his same impetuous self. They're waiting in prayer and supplication, and Peter stands up and says, "Fellows, there's a scripture that's gotta be fulfilled." And you know he's going to move ahead, "Let's get the program going; let's cast lots and find out who's going to take Judas' place." I do feel that Peter was again in the flesh, manifesting that impetuous nature that was his. And I think that the future history of the church in the book of Acts points this out. I am interested in Peter's understanding of the scriptures, how that he is quoting from so many places in the Old Testament. Peter does manifest a very great understanding of the Old Testament scriptures which is a point in his favor.<br/>Notice that Peter ascribes to the Holy Spirit those things that David wrote. So that, "All scripture is given by inspiration of God" ( 2Ti 3:16 ). Not part of the scriptures. Because, if you tell me that part of the scriptures are given by inspiration of God, then I must ask you, "What parts are by inspiration and what parts are not by inspiration?" And then you are then the authority who tells me what part I can believe and what part I can't believe. And the minute that God is no longer the authority but you're the authority, I'm in trouble. Beware of those who say, "Well, you can't believe all of the scriptures." The scriptures themselves say, "All scripture is given by inspiration of God." And here, Luke in writing of what Peter was saying, declares that David was actually the spokesman for the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit, by the mouth of David, spake concerning Judas.<br/>For he was numbered with us, [he was one of the twelve] he had obtained a part of this ministry. But now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity; and falling headlong ( Act 1:17-18 ),<br/>He purchased the field, the potter's field as Zachariah the eleventh chapter declares.<br/>and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all of his bowels gushed out ( Act 1:18 ).<br/>There are those who find a discrepancy in the scriptures, because in one of the gospels we are told that when Judas came back and tried to return the money, and they said, "Hey, it's your problem. We can't take it." And put it back in the temple treasury. "It's blood money." Then he threw it there on the floor of the temple and he went out and hung himself. Here Peter tells us that he fell headlong and just popped. And there are those who imagine a discrepancy. Very simple, he went up into the tree to hang himself, tied the rope around his neck and tied it to the limb and jumped. And the force of the fall either snapped the rope or his head, and he fell on down into the canyon and just as he said it here.<br/>It was known to all of the dwellers at Jerusalem; insomuch that the field is called in their tongue, Aceldama, that is to say, The field of blood. For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be desolate, and let no man dwell therein: and, His bishoprick let another take ( Act 1:19-20 ).<br/>Now in reality he's quoting from two different Psalms here. From Psa 69:25 ,he puts it together with Psa 109:8 . And putting the two together he finds these prophecies concerning Judas.<br/>Wherefore of these men ( Act 1:21 )<br/>Now here is where they are looking for someone to take Judas' place to be an apostle. Here are the qualifications they looked for in that time.<br/>Wherefore of these men which have companied with us all the time that the Lord Jesus when in and out among us ( Act 1:21 ),<br/>Now you remember there were many disciples, many disciples of which Jesus chose ten to be apostles. And the word apostle means "one who is sent out." Or chose twelve to be apostles, so He sent out the twelve. The number of human government. "We only have eleven. We need one to take Judas' place, but we need one who has been with us all the while from the beginning with Jesus."<br/>From the time he was baptized by John, until the day he was taken up from us, must one be ordained to be a witness [of what?] of His resurrection ( Act 1:22 ).<br/>So these were the requirements they were looking for. Someone who had been around the whole while. From the time of John's baptism to the ascension. And one who saw the risen Lord, and thus could bear fact of the resurrection, their testimony to the fact.<br/>Now Paul the apostle, later in asserting the fact that he was an apostle said, "Have I not seen the risen Christ?" Evidently that was one of the requirements of apostleship. Someone asked me, "Are there apostles today?" Well, I don't know. I don't think that there are in the same sense that they were in the New Testament. Surely there is none today who can bear witness to the resurrection as they did.<br/>They appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias. And they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord, which knowest the hearts of all men, show whether of these two that you have chosen ( Act 1:23-24 ),<br/>I think that we often make this mistake of giving the Lord two choices, both wrong. Limiting God, you see. We're so prone to do this. Obviously, Paul was God's choice. Peter was impetuous, and jumping the gun said, "Hey, we've got to do something, you know, gotta help God out. You know, one's missing and we've got to fill him in." And yet, "God, which one of these two do you want?" And giving God the two choices.<br/>That he may take part of this ministry and this apostleship, from which Judas by the transgression fell, that he might go to his own place. And so they gave forth their lots ( Act 1:25-26 );<br/>An interesting way by which they sought to determine the will of God. Let's throw dice, find out what God's will is here. It's interesting to me, the various ways that people have devised to discern the will of God. Now, in the Old Testament times they had an interesting way of coming to the priest, who would inquire of the Lord for them through the Urim and the Thummim, the "lights and perfections." Just what these Urim and Thummim were, we don't know. I'm sure they were not the colored glasses that Joseph Smith found with the Golden Tablets; the magic glasses, that when you put them on, you could suddenly read the hieroglyphic writing.<br/>There are those who say that the Urim and Thummim were actually a black and a white stone that was worn in a pouch on the chest of the priest. They would pray and ask the Lord a particular question. You remember that David was asking the Lord definite questions: "Lord, shall we go out against the Philistines?" The answer was, "No." So again, the next day, "Lord, shall we go out against the Philistines?" The answer was, "Yes." "When shall we go?" They would ask specific questions, and the Lord would direct them through the Urim and the Thummin. They say that the priest would pray, seek God, and then reach in and pull out one of the two stones. If it was the white stone, it was a yes answer. If it was a no, then it would be the black stone that he would pull out. Some even say we get the term blackballed from this Urim and Thummim. Actually, back in the original it is a no vote against a particular project or idea. Just what the Urim and Thummim were, we don't know. But during the Old Testament period, they did use a method of casting lots to determine the will of God.<br/>So here the disciples are picking up on the same thing as they are throwing the dice to see which of the two fellows that God had chosen to replace Judas Iscariot.<br/>the lot fell on Matthias; he was numbered with the eleven ( Act 1:26 ).<br/>Now who in the world is Matthias? No one ever heard of him before or since. It'll be interesting to meet Matthias and find out who he is and what he did. I think from the subsequent history, it's obvious to assume that God chose Paul as an apostle. Paul declares it himself. Now this is the last time we ever read of them seeking to discern the will of God by the casting of lots or by a chance kind of a thing.<br/>I know a fellow today, in seeking to discern the will of the Lord, will pray and ask the Lord a question. He'll have ten pennies in his pocket, and as he's praying, he'll take the pennies with his eyes closed and put them down on the table, and if they all come up heads, it's a yes. An interesting thing, every once in a while, they'll all come up heads, and that's pretty good odds. Yet, we don't find any pattern for this after the Holy Spirit was given. Once the Holy Spirit came upon the church, then the Holy Spirit began to speak to them and direct them. And the Holy Spirit said, "Separate unto me Paul and Barnabas for the ministry where I have called them" ( Act 13:2 ). And the Holy Spirit sent them forth. So we find the church more directly guided by the Holy Spirit. Once the Holy Spirit came, this throwing dice to find out the will of God was set aside.<br/>"<br/><br/>King James Version<br/><br/>This is the 1769 King James Version of the Holy Bible (also known as the Authorized Version). "Public Domain" | Smith Chuck - A través de la Biblia C2000 SeriesShall nos dirigimos al libro de Hechos, capítulo uno, a medida que comenzamos nuestro estudio de la iglesia primitiva.<br/>Lucas, el autor del libro de Hechos, un compañero del apóstol Pablo, que también fue autor del Evangelio según Lucas, escribió estos dos tratados a un amigo, Teófilo. Teófilo es un nombre griego. Es un nombre que tiene un significado hermoso. El nombre significa amante de Dios; hay algunos que creen que no fue un hombre en absoluto, sino que el evangelio y el libro de los Hechos fueron dirigidos a los amantes de Dios, quienquiera que ustedes sean. Hay otras tradiciones que dicen que Teófilo era en realidad el amo de Lucas. Que en aquellos días los médicos eran esclavos, por lo general el esclavo de un patrón rico. Así que el amo de Lucas era Teófilo, y él liberó a Lucas para que estuviera con Pablo en los viajes misioneros. Esta es una tradición antigua de la iglesia, pero es, por supuesto, imposible de probar, como muchas de las tradiciones.<br/>También hay quienes creen que cuando Pablo estaba en Troas y recibió una visión de un hombre llamándole diciendo: "Ven a Macedonia y ayúdanos", que ese hombre en la visión de Pablo no era otro que Lucas. Para el primero que Pablo realmente conoció cuando vino a Macedonia fue Lucas, y como estamos en el libro de los Hechos, usted encontrará que cuando llegamos a esa porción del libro de los Hechos, Lucas comienza a escribir más en primera persona en lugar de en tercera persona. Así es, evidentemente, en este punto particular en los Hechos de los Apóstoles que Lucas se convirtió en compañero de Pablo y comenzó a caminar con él. Comenzó a usar los pronombres "nosotros" y "nosotros" en lugar de "ellos" y "ellos". Aquí es, sin duda, donde Luke se convirtió en un participante y un testigo ocular de esas cosas que estaban sucediendo a partir de este momento. Les traeremos esto cuando lleguemos a ese punto.<br/>Él comienza los Hechos de los Apóstoles vinculándolo con el Evangelio según Lucas. Es interesante que lo último que Lucas registra en su evangelio es lo primero que registra en los Hechos de los Apóstoles. Encontramos que el evangelio de Lucas se cierra cuando Jesús está diciendo a Sus discípulos que esperen en Jerusalén hasta que sean investidos con poder desde lo alto. Y luego Jesús ascendió al cielo, y así cierra el evangelio. Al abrir los Hechos de los Apóstoles, escribe:<br/>El primer tratado [es decir, el Evangelio según Lucas,] te he escrito, oh Teófilo, de todo lo que Jesús comenzó a hacer y enseñar (Hechos 1:1),<br/>La palabra clave ha comenzado. El Evangelio según Lucas no es la historia completa del ministerio de Jesucristo. Es solo el comienzo del ministerio de Jesucristo. Jesús continúa ministrando a las necesidades de las personas. Jesús continúa sanando a los enfermos. Jesús continúa ministrando Su amor y Su evangelio al mundo, solo que ahora Él está ministrando a través de aquellos discípulos que han sido ungidos con Su Espíritu Santo. Pero el ministerio de Cristo continúa; básicamente, es la premisa que Lucas toma en los Hechos de los Apóstoles. El primer tratado de todo lo que Jesús comenzó, tanto para hacer como para enseñar.<br/>Ahora, por eso, los Hechos de los Apóstoles es un libro inacabado: en que el Señor hoy sigue trabajando a través de la vida de aquellos que se han dedicado a ser los instrumentos de Dios. Para ser guiado y ungido por Su Espíritu Santo, para continuar el ministerio de Jesús en el mundo de hoy. Ahora Dios ha ordenado que Su obra se lleve a cabo a través de instrumentos humanos. No digo que se deba llevar a cabo. Dios puede usar seres angélicos para Su obra, y llegará un momento, durante el libro de Apocalipsis, cuando Dios usará ángeles para proclamar Su evangelio a personas de todo el mundo. Apocalipsis, capítulo 14, "El primer ángel volando por en medio del cielo teniendo el evangelio eterno" (Apocalipsis 14:6). Pero en la actualidad, Dios ha elegido usar instrumentos humanos. Por imperfectos que sean, sin embargo, eso es lo que Dios ha ordenado usar. Lo emocionante de eso es que Dios me usará a mí y Dios te usará a ti. Muchas veces, estamos pidiendo, "Oh Señor, no puedo hablar. Nunca he podido hablar antes o incluso ahora, Señor". Mientras Moisés trataba de pedir el llamado de Dios. Jeremías dijo: "Señor, soy solo un niño; nadie me va a escuchar". Y todos tenemos nuestras excusas de por qué no podemos ser usados. ¿No es así? Todos sabemos las razones por las cuales Dios no pudo usarnos.<br/>Una vez, mientras el Señor llamaba a un profeta para que hiciera Su obra, dijo: “Señor, envía a quien quieras”. El Señor dijo: “Oye, te he llamado”. “Señor, buena idea; envía a quien quieras”. Muy a menudo estamos en esa posición, "Señor, envía por la mano de quien quieras, a cualquiera que no sea yo Señor." Y sin embargo, Dios ha ordenado que nos usemos.<br/>Ahora, cada uno de nosotros puede mostrar sus propias imperfecciones. Cada uno de nosotros puede señalar sus propias incapacidades, y todos podemos encontrar una excusa por la que Dios no querría usarme. Pero, sin embargo, Dios ha elegido usarte. Para que a través de tu vida Él pueda revelarse a un mundo necesitado, te preguntas cuándo Dios tiene tales instrumentos para usar cómo Él hizo el trabajo, ¿no es así?<br/>Hasta el día en que fue recibido arriba, después de que él por el Espíritu Santo había dado mandamientos a los apóstoles que había elegido (Hechos 1:2):<br/>Con eso terminó el Evangelio de Lucas: el día en que Jesús fue recibido arriba, después de haber dicho a los apóstoles que esperaran la investidura del poder.<br/>A quien también [es decir, los apóstoles también] se les mostró vivo después de su pasión [o muerte] por muchas pruebas infalibles (Hechos 1:3),<br/>Es difícil negar el hecho de la resurrección de Jesucristo. Me divertí, así como me molestó e irritó, un artículo que leí en el Registro de Santa Ana este sábado pasado. De la ciencia de la creación y las teorías evolutivas que se presentan en las escuelas del condado. Cómo eso, este profesor dijo que él enseña una clase de ciencias, y por lo tanto, se ocupan solo de los hechos, y que no tienen lugar para las teorías. Debido a que la ciencia se basa en hechos y la creación se basa en supersticiones religiosas. Se necesita mucha fe para creer en las teorías religiosas. Cuando se trata de hechos, simplemente puedes aceptarlos. Pensé: "Muy interesante en esa clase de ciencias, me enseñaron que era un hecho que el mundo tenía cuatro mil millones de años. Ahora están enseñando que es un hecho que el mundo tiene doce mil millones de años. Y no fue hace tanto tiempo que fui a la escuela”.<br/>Es interesante que la Biblia nunca ha necesitado ser revisada o actualizada para cumplir con los datos actuales que los hombres han descubierto. Y, sin embargo, si tomara mis libros de texto de ciencias de la escuela secundaria hoy y tratara de enseñar una clase de ciencias de ellos, encontraría que muchas de las cosas que se enseñaron como hechos científicos cuando estaba en la escuela secundaria ya no se reconocen como hechos científicos. El protoplasma celular simple ya no es una célula simple, sino extremadamente compleja. Si hay algún hecho que se pueda atestiguar en la historia es el hecho de la resurrección de Jesucristo de entre los muertos.<br/>Tenemos un sistema de jurisprudencia que se basa en el testimonio de los testigos. Si un hombre es acusado de un crimen y hay personas que presenciaron ese crimen mientras se estaba cometiendo, y son llevados a la norma, y juran decir la verdad, toda la verdad y nada más que la verdad, así que ayúdenlos a Dios. Y al interrogarlos afirman que, "Vi a ese hombre en el banco el veintitrés de mayo. Lo vi sacar un arma de su abrigo. Lo oí exigir que se le diera todo el dinero. Lo vi cuando salió del banco. Yo lo vi como el oficial lo aprehendió afuera." Y si usted puede conseguir tres o cuatro testigos para señalar a ese hombre y mantener su testimonio bajo interrogatorio, ese hombre es juzgado como culpable. Tenemos dos o tres testigos que están testificando la misma historia sobre ese hombre, y se acepta como un hecho que él es el que perpetró el crimen y es culpable.<br/>Después de la muerte de Jesús, cuando resucitó, se apareció a muchas personas diferentes que dieron testimonio jurado de que lo vieron, de que le hablaron, de que se les apareció en varios lugares en diferentes circunstancias. Y por un período de cuarenta días estuvo de visita con ellos. Y en un tiempo, hasta quinientas personas que estaban reunidas en un lugar, Él apareció. Es difícil simplemente dejar de lado o negar el testimonio de estas personas. Hacerlo es desacreditar todo nuestro sistema de jurisprudencia. Pero no solo eso, estos hombres que testificaron que vieron al Señor resucitado, que hablaron con Él, que comieron con Él, ellos, todos ellos, con la excepción de uno, encontraron muertes violentas a manos de otras personas debido a que afirmaron que la historia que contaron era verdadera. Hablas de testigos que juraron decir la verdad, toda la verdad, nada más que la verdad. Si la vida de una persona fuera amenazada por ese testigo, y fuera una mentira, al menos uno de ellos habría roto bajo la presión. Habrían confesado todo el engaño: "Se mostró vivo después de su pasión por muchas pruebas infalibles".<br/>ser vistos de ellos por cuarenta días, hablándoles de las cosas que pertenecen al reino de Dios (Hechos 1:3):<br/>A veces culpamos a los discípulos por sus preguntas sobre el tiempo del reino de Dios; recordemos que el reino de Dios era el tema favorito de Jesucristo. Él siempre estaba hablando del reino de Dios, y es una gran esperanza que Él estaba plantando en los corazones de todos los hombres. Las cosas no siempre van a continuar corrompidas como están. El mundo no irá para siempre bajo el poder de las tinieblas, bajo la esclavitud del mal. Un día Dios establecerá Su reino sobre la tierra. Un reino de gozo y paz justos. “Jesús reinará, donde antes el sol correrá sus viajes sucesivos; y su reino se extenderá de orilla a orilla.” Y ese día será el día más glorioso que el mundo haya visto jamás, así como la enfermedad, el sufrimiento y el dolor serán abolidos en Su reino, así como el pecado, la codicia y estas cosas que han hecho del mundo un lugar tan intolerable serán abolidas en Su reino. El comercialismo impío, la explotación del hombre, todas estas cosas abolidas en Su glorioso reino cuando Él reina. No es de extrañar que los discípulos estuvieran ansiosos por conseguirlo. Estoy ansioso por conseguirlo; estoy ansioso por que Su reino venga. Y Jesús nos dijo cuando oramos, la primera petición es: "Venga tu reino. Hágase tu voluntad en la tierra, como en el cielo" (Mateo 6:10). Esta es la clase correcta de un deseo que todos debemos tener. Yo deseo el reino de Dios. Y así les estaba hablando, durante este período de cuarenta días, del reino.<br/>Y estando reunidos con ellos, les mandó que no se apartaran de Jerusalén, sino que esperaran la promesa del Padre, la cual, dice él, vosotros habéis oído de mí (Hechos 1:4).<br/>Él dijo: “Mira, espera aquí en Jerusalén hasta que recibas la promesa del Padre”. Esta promesa a la que se refiere es, sin duda, la promesa en Joel, donde el Señor prometió: "Y acontecerá en los días venideros, dice el Señor, que derramaré mi Espíritu sobre toda carne; y vuestros hijos e hijas profetizarán, y vuestros jóvenes soñarán sueños, y vuestros ancianos verán visiones; y sobre mis siervos y mis siervas derramaré mi Espíritu, dice el Señor" (Jo 2, 28-29). La promesa del Padre: vendrá el día en que Dios derramará su Espíritu sobre toda carne, sobre todos los creyentes, y cada uno de ellos recibirá esa dinámica de Dios.<br/>Porque Juan verdaderamente bautizó con agua; pero vosotros seréis bautizados con el Espíritu Santo dentro de no muchos días (Hechos 1:5).<br/>La idea del bautismo era la de la emersión, el bapteedzo. Juan bautizó con agua, sumergió a la gente en agua, "vas a ser sumergido en el Espíritu Santo en no muchos días."<br/>Y cuando se juntaron, le preguntaron, diciendo: Señor, ¿restaurarás el reino a Israel en este tiempo?<br/>"¿Cuándo va a ser, Señor? ¿Cuándo es el momento de esta restauración?" Y Jesús está hablando con ellos ahora, no sobre el reino, sino sobre el poder que van a recibir para el servicio.<br/>Diciéndoles: No os toca a vosotros saber los tiempos o las sazones que el Padre ha puesto en su poder (Hechos 1:7).<br/>Ellos vivieron constantemente en la anticipación del establecimiento inmediato del reino. Durante toda la vida de Jesús, ellos estaban esperando que Él en cualquier momento entrara a la cabina telefónica y saliera como el salvador del mundo. ¡Shazzam! Demostrando su poder y derrocando a los gobiernos del mundo, estableciendo el reino de Dios sobre la tierra. Y ellos estaban esperando diariamente que este cambio sucediera. Y cada vez que Jesús hablaba de ir a Jerusalén, ser entregado en manos de un hombre pecador, y luego ser crucificado, "Oh, oh no, Señor. No, no entiendes el reino, Señor. Cuando Jesús murió en la cruz, todos estaban muy decepcionados.<br/>Los dos discípulos en el camino a Emaús, tan tristes. "Oigan, compañeros. ¿Por qué están tan tristes como caminando a lo largo?" "¿Qué quieres decir? Usted debe ser un extraño por aquí si no sabes las cosas que han estado sucediendo últimamente en Jerusalén." "Oh, un hombre llamado Jesús de Nazaret... oh hombre, era poderoso y poderoso. La unción de Dios estaba sobre su vida. Teníamos la esperanza de que en Él estaba la liberación de Israel, pero lo crucificaron. Teníamos la esperanza. . . ahora está muerto ". Ahora El ha resucitado, y El está diciendo: “En unos pocos días, compañeros, ustedes van a recibir la promesa del Padre.” “Oh, ¿qué promesa? ¿La promesa del establecimiento del reino?” ¿Es este el tiempo? ¿Vas a establecer tu reino ahora? "No. No es para ti saber esas veces que el Padre ha designado o que el Padre tiene en su propio poder. Pero, recibirás poder cuando el Espíritu Santo haya venido sobre ti."<br/>Ahora, aquí, la preposición griega epi se usa para significar una nueva relación que debían tener con el Espíritu Santo. En el Evangelio según Juan, capítulo 14, como Jesús está allí prometiendo enviar al Espíritu Santo, Él dijo: "No os dejaré sin consuelo. Yo vendré a vosotros, y yo rogaré al Padre, y él os enviará otro consolador, el Espíritu de Verdad, al cual el mundo no puede recibir porque no le ve, ni le conoce; pero vosotros le conocéis, porque mora con vosotros, y estará en vosotros” (Juan 14:17-18). La misma preposición griega que la nuestra, solo que la deletrean "en" en lugar de "en". Relación doble allí en Juan: Él está contigo, pero Él va a morar en ti. Pero ahora Jesús dijo que vas a recibir poder cuando el Espíritu Santo venga sobre ti. La preposición griega epi, que se traduce en diferentes textos a lo largo del Nuevo Testamento como "sobre" o "sobre" o me gusta, "desbordamientos".<br/>En el séptimo capítulo del evangelio de Juan: “En el último día, el gran día de la fiesta cuando Jesús estaba allí en el Monte del Templo y clamó al pueblo: ‘Si alguno tiene sed, venga a mí y beba; y el que beba del agua que yo doy, de lo más profundo de su ser brotarán torrentes de agua viva’”. Juan dijo: "Esto dijo del Espíritu, que aún no había sido dado, y que habían de recibir los que creyeran en él" (Juan 7:37-39). ¿Qué habló del Espíritu? Para que fuera como un torrente de agua viva que fluye. Me gusta: "Cuando el Espíritu se derrama sobre vosotros", o sobre vosotros, o se derrama de vosotros. Así que la triple relación: Él está contigo antes de tu conversión, Él es quien te hace darte cuenta de que eres un pecador, Él es quien señala a Jesucristo como la respuesta mientras convence al mundo de pecado, de justicia y de juicio. En el momento en que abres tu vida y tu corazón a Jesucristo y lo invitas a entrar, el Espíritu Santo viene y comienza a morar en ti. Él estará en ti. "No sabéis que no sois vuestros, sino que habéis sido comprados por precio; glorificad, pues, a Dios en vuestro cuerpo y en vuestro espíritu, los cuales son suyos; y ¿no sabéis que vuestro cuerpo es templo del Espíritu Santo que está en vosotros? No os embriaguéis con vino, en lo cual hay exceso, sino sed llenos, o sed llenos del Espíritu” (1 Corintios 6:19-20, Efesios 5:18). Pero ahora aquí hay una tercera relación.<br/>Recibirás [el dunamus] la dinámica, cuando el Espíritu Santo haya venido sobre ti [o sobre vosotros, o cuando haya desbordamiento de vosotros], y me seréis testigos” (Hechos 1:8).<br/>Y así la dinámica, ser testigo de Jesucristo. Es interesante que la palabra testigo en griego es la palabra martus de donde obtenemos nuestra palabra mártir. Y en griego significa mártir. Un testigo es aquel que no sólo proclama lo que cree, sino que vive lo que cree, es lo que cree, y lo cree con tanta fuerza que, si es necesario, morirá por lo que cree. No puedes detenerlo, no tiene miedo de morir por lo que cree.<br/>Usted recuerda cuando Pablo estaba en su camino de regreso a Jerusalén y Agabo bajó de Cesarea y tomó el cinturón de Pablo y se ató a sí mismo y dijo: "Así es el hombre que posee este cinturón para ser atado cuando llegue a Jerusalén." Y los amigos de Pablo comenzaron a llorar, diciendo: "Oh, Pablo, no vayas, no vayas". Y él dijo: "¿Qué quieres decir con estas lágrimas? ¿Crees que vas a disuadirme? ¿Crees que estoy preocupado por estar atado? Estoy listo para morir ". Él era un martus. "Estoy dispuesto a morir." Ser condenado a muerte por tu fe no te convirtió en un mártir; porque fuiste un mártir, fuiste condenado a muerte; porque fuiste un testigo, porque lo creíste tan fuerte. Por lo tanto, no te hizo testigo, solo demostró lo que eras. Fuiste testigo todo el tiempo. Si no hubieras sido un martus, nunca habrías ido a tu muerte. Te habrías retractado; habrías dicho: "Whoa, whoa, espera, espera. Espere, vamos a cambiar de rumbo aquí. Creo que puedo haber cometido un error." Entonces dices: "Bueno, él no era un martus. Robar un caballo no te hace un ladrón de caballos; solo demuestra que lo eras. Nadie roba un caballo a menos que sea un ladrón de caballos. Así que robarlo no te convierte en un ladrón de caballos, solo prueba que siempre fuiste martirizado. Ser martirizado solo prueba lo que fuiste un testigo, un martus. "Y serás testigos". ¿Y no es interesante que la mayoría de ellos fueron martirizados? "Testigos para Mí".<br/>El testigo debía estar tanto en Jerusalén como en toda Judea (Hechos 1:8).<br/>El testigo comenzó justo en su casa, el lugar más difícil, ¿no es así? Es comenzar justo en su casa en Jerusalén, y luego en el área alrededor de Jerusalén, el área de Judea. Y luego se extendió a Samaria. Y entonces fue para salir a los confines del mundo. Y mientras estudiamos el libro de Hechos, veremos esta misma progresión. Cómo comenzó el testimonio en Jerusalén. Obtendremos eso en el próximo capítulo. Y luego veremos cómo comenzó a extenderse por Judea, y luego Felipe subió a Samaria, y finalmente Pablo y Bernabé son llamados a ir a los confines del mundo. Y así el testimonio se difundió a través de la unción y el poder del Espíritu Santo.<br/>Y habiendo dicho estas cosas, mientras ellos miraban, fue alzado; y una nube lo recibió de delante de ellos” (Hechos 1:9).<br/>Esta es la promesa final hecha por Jesús a Sus discípulos. Estas son las palabras finales antes de Su ascensión. Por supuesto, más tarde Él vino y habló con Pablo y otros, pero antes de Su ascensión, esta es Su palabra final. Y sobre esto, habiendo dicho estas cosas, viéndolo ellos, fue alzado, y una nube le recibió de delante de sus ojos.<br/>Y mientras miraban fijamente hacia el cielo mientras subía, he aquí, había dos hombres que estaban junto a ellos vestidos de blanco (Hechos 1:10).<br/>Suponemos que eran ángeles.<br/>Los cuales también dijeron: Varones galileos, ¿por qué estáis mirando al cielo? Este mismo Jesús, que ha sido tomado de vosotros al cielo, así vendrá como le habéis visto ir al cielo (Hechos 1:11).<br/>Lo vieron cuando ascendió al cielo y lo verán cuando vuelva: "He aquí que el Señor viene con diez millares de sus santos, para hacer juicio sobre la tierra" (Jueces 1:14-15). Y luego, "Al que nos amó y se entregó por nosotros y nos hizo para nuestro Dios, reyes y sacerdotes que reinarán con él sobre la tierra, he aquí viene el Señor, y todo ojo le verá, y también los que le traspasaron se lamentarán" (Apocalipsis 1: 5-7). Los Testigos de Jehová dicen que Él ya ha venido, pero fue una venida secreta, ya que solo los discípulos lo vieron ir, solo los discípulos de los Testigos de Jehová lo vieron regresar. Pero Jesús dijo: “Si os dicen: ‘Él ha venido en secreto y ha entrado en una cámara secreta, no lo creáis’” (Mateo 24:26), así que tenéis que elegir, creer a Jesús o a ellos.<br/>"Este mismo Jesús, que ha sido tomado de vosotros al cielo, vendrá de la misma manera que le habéis visto ir al cielo."<br/>Ahora hay un verso muy interesante en II Juan, verso Acto 1:7, "Porque muchos engañadores han entrado en el mundo que no confiesan que Jesucristo ha venido en la carne." Eso, por desgracia, es una mala traducción del griego. Porque este participio está en tiempo presente y debe traducirse "viene en la carne". Los que niegan que Jesucristo viene en la carne. ¿Qué dice Juan de ellos? "Son un engañador y un anticristo. Mirad a vosotros mismos, que no perdamos lo que hemos hecho, sino que recibamos una recompensa completa; porque cualquiera que transgrede y no permanece en la doctrina de Cristo, no tiene a Dios. El que permanece en la doctrina de Cristo, tiene tanto al Padre como al Hijo; y si alguno llega a tu puerta (el sábado por la mañana) y no traes esta doctrina, no lo recibas en tu casa, y no le digas adiós. Porque el que le dice adiós es partícipe de sus malas obras” (2Jn 1:7-11). Hágales una pregunta: “¿Viene Jesús en la carne?” Simplemente hágales esa pregunta. Y si dicen que no, recuerden lo que Juan les advirtió y lo que Juan les dijo. "Si alguno no confiesa que Jesucristo viene en la carne." ¿Te acuerdas cuando estaba con los discípulos y dijo: "Dame de comer"? Él dijo: "Ustedes saben, los espíritus no comen; tóquenme. Por lo tanto, este mismo Jesús viene otra vez de la misma manera en que lo vieron ir al cielo. Y yo, por mi parte, creo que esa venida es muy pronto.<br/>Luego regresaron a Jerusalén desde el monte llamado de los Olivos, que es de Jerusalén, un viaje de un día de reposo [como dos tercios de milla]. Y cuando hubieron entrado, subieron al aposento alto, donde estaban Pedro, Jacobo, Juan, Andrés, Felipe, Tomás, Bartolomé, Mateo, Jacobo hijo de Alfeo, Simón el Zelote y Judas hermano de Jacobo. Y todos estos continuaron unánimes en oración y ruego, con las mujeres, y con María la madre de Jesús, y con sus hermanos (Hechos 1:12-14).<br/>Esta es la última mención de María, la madre de Jesús. En este punto y a partir de este momento, no hay más mención de ella en los Hechos de los Apóstoles o en las epístolas. Ninguna mención de su muerte o de su ascensión milagrosa al cielo, sin muerte. Nada se menciona en la Escritura, es silencioso.<br/>Sus hermanos serían una referencia probablemente a Santiago y a Judas y a aquellos otros hermanos que eran hijos de José y María.<br/>El aposento superior, hay algunos que dicen que es el mismo aposento superior en el que Jesús tuvo la última cena con Sus discípulos; y sin embargo, hay otros que sostienen que este aposento superior es un aposento en los recintos del templo donde se reunía la iglesia primitiva. Toma tu decisión.<br/>Y en aquellos días Pedro se puso de pie en medio de los discípulos, y dijo, (el número de sus nombres juntos era como ciento veinte), hombres y hermanos, esta Escritura debe haber sido cumplida, que el Espíritu Santo habló antes por boca de David acerca de Judas, que era una guía para los que tomaron a Jesús (Hechos 1:15-16).<br/>Una vez más, Pedro sigue siendo su mismo yo impetuoso. Están esperando en oración y súplica, y Pedro se pone de pie y dice: "Queridos, hay una escritura que debe cumplirse". Y usted sabe que él va a seguir adelante, "Vamos a poner en marcha el programa; vamos a echar suertes y averiguar quién va a tomar el lugar de Judas." Siento que Pedro estaba de nuevo en la carne, manifestando esa naturaleza impetuosa que era suya. Y creo que la historia futura de la iglesia en el libro de Hechos señala esto. Estoy interesado en la comprensión de Pedro de las escrituras, cómo él está citando de tantos lugares en el Antiguo Testamento. Pedro manifiesta una gran comprensión de las escrituras del Antiguo Testamento, que es un punto a su favor.<br/>Note que Pedro atribuye al Espíritu Santo las cosas que David escribió. De modo que, "Toda la Escritura es inspirada por Dios" (2 Ti 3:16). No es parte de las Escrituras. Porque, si me dices que parte de las Escrituras son dadas por inspiración de Dios, entonces debo preguntarte: "¿Qué partes son por inspiración y qué partes no son por inspiración?" Y entonces tú eres la autoridad que me dice en qué parte puedo creer y en qué parte no puedo creer, y en el momento en que Dios ya no es la autoridad, pero tú eres la autoridad, estoy en problemas. Tenga cuidado con aquellos que dicen: "Bueno, no puedes creer en todas las Escrituras". Las Escrituras mismas dicen: "Toda la Escritura es inspirada por Dios". Y aquí, Lucas por escrito de lo que Pedro estaba diciendo, declara que David era en realidad el portavoz del Espíritu Santo, el Espíritu Santo, por boca de David, habló acerca de Judas.<br/>Porque había sido contado con nosotros, [él era uno de los doce] que había obtenido una parte de este ministerio. Pero ahora este hombre compró un campo con la recompensa de la iniquidad, y cayendo de cabeza (Hechos 1:17-18),<br/>Él compró el campo, el campo del alfarero como Zachariah el undécimo capítulo declara.<br/>Y cayendo de cabeza, rompió en pedazos en medio, y todas sus entrañas brotaron (Hechos 1:18).<br/>Hay quienes encuentran una discrepancia en las Escrituras, porque en uno de los evangelios se nos dice que cuando Judas regresó y trató de devolver el dinero, y dijeron: "Oye, es tu problema, no podemos tomarlo". Y lo puso de nuevo en el tesoro del templo. "Es dinero de sangre." Luego lo tiró allí en el piso del templo y salió y se ahorcó. Aquí Pedro nos dice que se cayó de cabeza y simplemente hizo estallar. Y hay quienes imaginan una discrepancia. Muy simple, subió al árbol para ahorcarse, se ató la cuerda alrededor del cuello y la ató a la extremidad y saltó. Y la fuerza de la caída rompió la cuerda o su cabeza, y cayó en el cañón y tal como lo dijo aquí.<br/>Era conocido por todos los habitantes de Jerusalén; de tal manera que el campo es llamado en su lengua, Aceldama, es decir, el campo de sangre. Porque está escrito en el libro de los Salmos: Sea desolada su morada, y nadie more en ella; y su obispado tome otro (Hechos 1:19-20).<br/>Ahora en realidad él está citando dos Salmos diferentes aquí. De Salmo 69:25, él lo pone junto con Salmo 109:8. Y juntando los dos él encuentra estas profecías concernientes a Judas.<br/>Por lo tanto, de estos hombres (Hechos 1:21)<br/>Ahora aquí es donde ellos están buscando a alguien que tome el lugar de Judas para ser un apóstol. Aquí están las calificaciones que ellos buscaron en ese tiempo.<br/>Por lo tanto, de estos hombres que han estado con nosotros todo el tiempo que el Señor Jesús entraba y salía entre nosotros (Hechos 1:21),<br/>Ahora recuerden que había muchos discípulos, muchos discípulos de los cuales Jesús escogió a diez para ser apóstoles. Y la palabra apóstol significa "el que ha sido enviado". O escogió a doce para ser apóstoles, así que Él envió a los doce. "Solo tenemos once. Necesitamos a uno para tomar el lugar de Judas, pero necesitamos a uno que haya estado con nosotros todo el tiempo desde el principio con Jesús".<br/>Desde el momento en que fue bautizado por Juan, hasta el día en que fue tomado de entre nosotros, debe uno ser ordenado para ser testigo [¿de qué?] de Su resurrección (Hechos 1:22).<br/>Así que estos eran los requisitos que buscaban. Alguien que había estado alrededor todo el tiempo. Desde el momento del bautismo de Juan hasta la ascensión. Y uno que vio al Señor resucitado, y así pudo soportar el hecho de la resurrección, su testimonio del hecho.<br/>Ahora bien, el apóstol Pablo, más tarde, al afirmar el hecho de que él era un apóstol, dijo: "¿No he visto al Cristo resucitado?" Evidentemente, ese era uno de los requisitos del apostolado. Alguien me preguntó: "¿Hay apóstoles hoy?" Bueno, no sé. No creo que haya en el mismo sentido que estaban en el Nuevo Testamento. Seguramente no hay nadie hoy en día que pueda dar testimonio de la resurrección como lo hicieron.<br/>Y nombraron a dos: a José, llamado Barsabas, que tenía por sobrenombre Justo, y a Matías; y orando, dijeron: Tú, Señor, que conoces el corazón de todos, muestra si de estos dos has escogido.<br/>Creo que a menudo cometemos este error de darle al Señor dos opciones, ambas equivocadas. Limitar a Dios, ya ves. Somos muy propensos a hacer esto. Obviamente, Pablo fue la elección de Dios. Peter era impetuoso, y saltando el arma dijo: "Oye, tenemos que hacer algo, ya sabes, tenemos que ayudar a Dios, ya sabes, uno está perdido y tenemos que llenarlo." Y sin embargo, "Dios, ¿cuál de estos dos quieres?" Y darle a Dios las dos opciones.<br/>Para que participe de este ministerio y de este apostolado, de los cuales cayó Judas por la transgresión, y se fuera a su lugar; y así dieron su suerte” (Hechos 1:25-26).<br/>Una manera interesante por la cual trataron de determinar la voluntad de Dios. Vamos a tirar dados, averiguar cuál es la voluntad de Dios está aquí. Es interesante para mí, las diversas maneras que las personas han ideado para discernir la voluntad de Dios. Ahora, en los tiempos del Antiguo Testamento ellos tenían una manera interesante de venir al sacerdote, quien consultaría al Señor por ellos a través del Urim y el Tumim, las "luces y perfecciones". Estoy seguro de que no eran las gafas de colores que José Smith encontró con las Tablas Doradas; las gafas mágicas, que cuando te las pones, de repente podrías leer la escritura jeroglífica.<br/>Hay quienes dicen que el Urim y Tumim eran en realidad una piedra negra y una piedra blanca que se llevaba en una bolsa en el pecho del sacerdote. Ellos oraban y le hacían al Señor una pregunta en particular. ¿Recuerdas que David estaba haciendo preguntas definitivas al Señor: "Señor, ¿saldremos contra los filisteos?" La respuesta fue: "No". Así que de nuevo, al día siguiente, "Señor, ¿saldremos contra los filisteos?" La respuesta fue: "Sí". Ellos hacían preguntas específicas, y el Señor los dirigía a través del Urim y los Tumin. Dicen que el sacerdote oraba, buscaba a Dios, y luego se acercaba y sacaba una de las dos piedras. Si era la piedra blanca, era una respuesta afirmativa. Si fuera un no, entonces sería la piedra negra que él sacaría. Algunos incluso dicen que obtenemos el término blackballed de este Urim y Tumim. En realidad, en el original es un voto negativo contra un proyecto o idea en particular. No sabemos lo que eran el Urim y Tumim, pero durante el período del Antiguo Testamento, usaron un método de echar suertes para determinar la voluntad de Dios.<br/>Así que aquí los discípulos están recogiendo la misma cosa, ya que están tirando los dados para ver cuál de los dos tipos que Dios había elegido para reemplazar a Judas Iscariote.<br/>la suerte cayó sobre Matías; fue contado con los once (Hechos 1:26).<br/>Ahora, ¿quién en el mundo es Matías? Nadie ha oído hablar de él antes o después. Será interesante conocer a Matías y averiguar quién es y qué hizo. Creo que a partir de la historia posterior, es obvio suponer que Dios eligió a Pablo como apóstol. Pablo mismo lo declara: “Esta es la última vez que leemos de ellos tratando de discernir la voluntad de Dios por echar suertes o por una suerte de cosa.<br/>Conozco a un compañero hoy, al tratar de discernir la voluntad del Señor, orará y le hará una pregunta al Señor. Tendrá diez peniques en su bolsillo, y mientras está orando, tomará los peniques con los ojos cerrados y los pondrá sobre la mesa, y si todos salen cara, es un sí. Una cosa interesante, de vez en cuando, todos van a salir cara, y eso es bastante buena probabilidad, sin embargo, no encontramos ningún patrón para esto después de que el Espíritu Santo fue dado. Una vez que el Espíritu Santo vino sobre la iglesia, entonces el Espíritu Santo comenzó a hablarles y dirigirlos, y el Espíritu Santo dijo: "Apartadme a Pablo y a Bernabé para el ministerio donde los he llamado" (Hechos 13:2). Y el Espíritu Santo los envió, así que encontramos a la iglesia guiada más directamente por el Espíritu Santo. Una vez que vino el Espíritu Santo, este lanzar dados para descubrir la voluntad de Dios fue puesto a un lado.<br/>"<br/><br/>Versión King James<br/><br/>Esta es la versión King James de 1769 de la Santa Biblia (también conocida como la Versión Autorizada). |

Yes that is correct, the Urbanears don't have a built in noise cancelling mic on the headphone itself but from what I can see there is a mic on the cable provided.<br/>1. Well the mic is usually placed where it can have a connection to the PCB which are within the headphones so if you mean that the mic shouldn't be on the headphone itself, that (from my experience) is incorrect.<br/>2.

In fact, dynamic drivers work exactly the same as dynamic microphones but in reverse. Inside a dynamic driver there is a magnet, and when you plug in the headphones, you are sending a AC current through it which will turn the voice coil into a magnet. Depending on the direction of the current, the polarity of the magnet will change. Now since we know for a magnet, same charges repels and different charges attract, we know that the voice coil will move back and forth depending on it's polarity at the time. The voice coil is attached to the diaphragm which will then move back and forth creating a sound wave. The same occurs in reverse, if you move a coil through a magnet you produce a current instead. Since your voice is pushing the diaphragm, it is moving the voice coil back and forth generating the current you have observed.<br/><br/>100+ Head-Fier<br/><br/>Joined:<br/>Nov 7, 2011<br/><br/>Posts:<br/>134<br/><br/>Likes: 55<br/><br/>Exactly.

Dentro de un controlador dinámico hay un imán, y cuando conecta los auriculares, está enviando una corriente alterna a través de él que convertirá la bobina de voz en un imán. Dependiendo de la dirección de la corriente, la polaridad del imán cambiará. Ahora que sabemos que para un imán, las mismas cargas se repelen y diferentes cargas se atraen, sabemos que la bobina de voz se moverá hacia adelante y hacia atrás dependiendo de su polaridad en ese momento. La bobina de voz está unida al diafragma que luego se moverá hacia adelante y hacia atrás creando una onda de sonido. Lo mismo ocurre a la inversa, si mueve una bobina a través de un imán, produce una corriente en su lugar.

Stalin's opposition within the party, including Bukharin, Yagoda and Rykov were purged in these show trials, as Stalin manipulatively forced them to confess to crimes of planning a coup and opposing the state, even if there was no proof. Gabor T Rittersporn said, "Many of the victims were sincerely devoted to the principles of Bolshevism." This amplifies proof that the Bolshevik ideals that had once been the roots of the Communist Party were being disarranged and destroyed by the Purges. The party was depleted and former members helplessly watched Stalin use the great purge as a tool to transform Russia from a one party state to an unchallenged dictatorship. Again, the purges were shattering the framework of the Communist Party, formed during the Bolshevik revolution. This agrees with the "Stalin the executioner" source as both show the manipulative character, that helped the dictator to enhance his grip on Russia's throat.<br/>The manipulative manner, with which Stalin incriminated his targeted opposition during the purges, in the eyes of everyday Russians, also had an implosive impact on Soviet Society. Stalin was able to collect support from the people through his use of propaganda and the media to help him develop a "cult of personality" and the image of a heroic and brave leader. Through this support Stalin implanted mistrust into the minds of the people, convincing them that traitors of the revolution and what he described as 'enemies of the people', were amongst them.

Gabor T. Rittersporn dijo: "Muchas de las víctimas estaban sinceramente dedicadas a los principios del bolchevismo". Esto amplifica la prueba de que los ideales bolcheviques que una vez habían sido las raíces del Partido Comunista estaban siendo desorganizados y destruidos por las Purgas. El partido se agotó y los antiguos miembros vieron impotentes a Stalin usar la gran purga como una herramienta para transformar a Rusia de un estado de partido a una dictadura sin oposición.

| Supercell is nerfing brawlers instead of nerfing star powers. I was at 750 last season with power 8 nita and it is very tough to go past that, like, star powers play a really dominant role. The matchmaking is also trash. When i play gem grab(around 600 trophies), there are often matchups where the enemy team has one more player than us who is maxed and it's not even that we have a lvl 9 to compete versus that. Sometimes there are even matchups where the enemy team is fully maxed and none of us are. this is why i dont play brawl stars seriously anymore. It's not even like there arent many players who are not maxed and around 600 trophies. It's annoying.<br/>Edit: I think supercell should have at least a basic mechanism that takes the average of levels of brawlers when setting up matches.<br/><br/>Except trophies don't really indicate your skill. They indicate the skill of the teammates you are placed with. And I'm fine with playing against higher level brawlers, but when one team is all level 10 and the other team isn't, clearly it's unbalanced.<br/><br/>I reccomend getting some good friends to play with, me and 2 friends got my friends power 1 tick to rank 28 by playing gem grab with a certain composition all day and we made it without a single one of us being maxed with our brawlers.<br/><br/>I Know how you feel I used to have brawlers in high trophies with low level and it's to difficult to go more further and everything I was saying to myself "I want to have star powers" really supercell needs to make balance to the star powers or at least make a better matchmaking system.<br/><br/>I kinda feel this. I ain't as good at the game as you, but I got Emz to 500 at power 1 and the matchmaking was horrible. Maxed out players everywhere! And it didn't help that the majority of my teammates had around 5-8k trophies... I had to resort to solo showdown last minute because I can either ambush unsuspecting players or simply play a little aggressive at the right times. But I really wish that it could be a bit easier for people who want to push brawlers to really high trophy ranges without having the luxury of star powers.<br/><br/>Altho spike is still good without curveball. Curveball was just a help for hitting your shots more often as spike. But even before curveball was released, spike was a really strong brawler, so he will remain the same now.<br/><br/>I agree that they should have nerfed ambush, but I think they are trying to balance both Snappy Sniping and Ambush, as they are both getting merged with this change. She was becoming a little powerful, but still not nerf-worthy<br/><br/>I'm not sure about this, but now that Darryl got a noticeable buff, looking at their new stats, it looks like Darryl might overshadow Bull, as not only he can always deal more damage than Bull, he won't die as early anymore, so their survivability will be similar without star power (although Bull's survivability is still noticeably better than Darryl's if he had Tough Guy). Not only that, Darryl's super can auto regenerate, meaning Darryl MIGHT be able to be played effectively both as a heavyweight AND an assassin at the same time (before he sucks as a heavyweight but decent as an assassin)<br/><br/>But hes overrated af. And you get trophies with him really easily. So im kinda ok with the nerf. I havent even played him since when I got him to 500 (around 5 months ago), so not that I care that much either.<br/><br/>Why doesn't Poco/Penny get a HP nerf, if they are Marksman/Healer respectively not a tank?<br/>Why isn't Rosa's tankyness nerfed, cough 70% damage reduction?<br/>Why is Tick allowed to have the highest range and the most free pokedamage in the entire game?<br/>Why doesn't Leon get a HP/Damage buff?<br/><br/>Be that as it may, it was Ambush that was OP, not base Piper. I would argue that Ambush is the best star power in the game (now even more so since the percentage of damage increase indirectly went up) and base Piper was a bottom-10 brawler.<br/><br/>What Supercell should do is revert both nerfs, reduce Ambush to 600, and reduce Snappy Sniping to 0.25 since it'd be indirectly buffed by the base damage buff.<br/><br/>Yea and I believe they went a bit too far with Rosa, because now she is basically the better bull now when it comes to tanking, which she has been for a while. Now, Darryl might as well be a smaller, more powerful bull<br/><br/>Why? I feel she needs a buff in almost everything except her star power. Her health and speed make her super a bit more difficult to use, because she can die pretty easily, and it is really difficult for her to trap faster brawlers like Crow. Her star power is a bit broken though... | Supercell está nerfing peleadores en lugar de nerfing poderes de estrellas. Yo estaba en 750 la temporada pasada con poder 8 nita y es muy difícil ir más allá de eso, como, poderes de estrellas juegan un papel muy dominante. El emparejamiento también es basura. Cuando juego en gemas (alrededor de 600 trofeos), a menudo hay enfrentamientos en los que el equipo enemigo tiene un jugador más que nosotros que está al máximo y ni siquiera tenemos un lvl 9 para competir contra eso. A veces incluso hay enfrentamientos donde el equipo enemigo está completamente maximizado y ninguno de nosotros lo está. Es por eso que ya no juego a las estrellas de la pelea en serio. Ni siquiera es como si no hubiera muchos jugadores que no estén maximizados y alrededor de 600 trofeos. Es molesto.<br/>Editar: Creo que la supercélula debería tener al menos un mecanismo básico que tome el promedio de niveles de peleadores al configurar partidas.<br/><br/>Excepto que los trofeos no indican realmente tu habilidad, indican la habilidad de los compañeros de equipo con los que estás colocado, y estoy bien jugando contra peleadores de nivel superior, pero cuando un equipo es de nivel 10 y el otro equipo no, claramente está desequilibrado.<br/><br/>Recomiendo conseguir algunos buenos amigos para jugar, yo y 2 amigos conseguimos mis amigos poder 1 tick para el rango 28 jugando gema agarrar con una cierta composición todo el día y lo hicimos sin uno solo de nosotros estar al máximo con nuestros peleadores.<br/><br/>Sé cómo te sientes, solía tener peleadores en trofeos altos con bajo nivel y es difícil ir más lejos y todo lo que me decía a mí mismo "Quiero tener poderes estelares" realmente la supercélula necesita equilibrar los poderes estelares o al menos hacer un mejor sistema de emparejamiento.<br/><br/>Siento algo así. No soy tan bueno en el juego como tú, pero conseguí que Emz llegara a 500 en el poder 1 y el emparejamiento fue horrible. ¡Maxed out jugadores en todas partes! Y no ayudó que la mayoría de mis compañeros de equipo tuvieran alrededor de 5-8k trofeos... Tuve que recurrir al enfrentamiento en solitario de último minuto porque puedo emboscar a jugadores desprevenidos o simplemente jugar un poco agresivo en el momento adecuado. Pero realmente desearía que fuera un poco más fácil para las personas que quieren empujar a los luchadores a rangos de trofeos realmente altos sin tener el lujo de los poderes de las estrellas.<br/><br/>Alto pico sigue siendo bueno sin curveball. Curveball fue solo una ayuda para golpear sus tiros más a menudo como pico. Pero incluso antes de que se lanzara curveball, el pico era un luchador muy fuerte, por lo que seguirá siendo el mismo ahora.<br/><br/>Estoy de acuerdo en que deberían haber nerfed emboscada, pero creo que están tratando de equilibrar tanto Snappy Sniping y Emboscada, ya que ambos se están fusionando con este cambio.<br/><br/>No estoy seguro de esto, pero ahora que Darryl obtuvo un beneficio notable, mirando sus nuevas estadísticas, parece que Darryl podría eclipsar a Bull, ya que no solo siempre puede hacer más daño que Bull, sino que ya no morirá tan pronto, por lo que su supervivencia será similar sin poder estelar (aunque la supervivencia de Bull sigue siendo notablemente mejor que la de Darryl si tuviera Tough Guy). No solo eso, el super de Darryl puede regenerarse automáticamente, lo que significa que Darryl podría jugarse de manera efectiva tanto como un peso pesado como un asesino al mismo tiempo (antes de que apesta como un peso pesado pero decente como un asesino)<br/><br/>Pero está sobrevalorado af. Y obtienes trofeos con él muy fácilmente. Así que estoy un poco bien con el nerf. Ni siquiera lo he jugado desde que lo llevé a 500 (hace unos 5 meses), así que tampoco me importa mucho.<br/><br/>¿Por qué Poco/Penny no consiguen un HP nerf, si son Marksman/Healer respectivamente no un tanque?<br/>¿Por qué la flojera de Rosa no se nutre, reduce el daño en la tos en un 70%?<br/>¿Por qué se permite que Tick tenga el rango más alto y el pokedamage más libre en todo el juego?<br/>¿Por qué Leon no consigue un HP/Damage buff?<br/><br/>Sea como fuere, fue Ambush que fue OP, no base Piper. Yo diría que Ambush es la mejor potencia estelar en el juego (ahora aún más ya que el porcentaje de aumento de daño aumentó indirectamente) y base Piper fue un luchador de fondo 10.<br/><br/>Lo que Supercell debería hacer es revertir ambos nerfs, reducir Ambush a 600 y reducir Snappy Sniping a 0.25 ya que sería indirectamente mejorado por el buff de daño base.<br/><br/>Sí y creo que fueron un poco demasiado lejos con Rosa, porque ahora ella es básicamente el mejor toro ahora cuando se trata de tanking, lo que ha sido por un tiempo. Ahora, Darryl también podría ser un toro más pequeño y más poderoso.<br/><br/>Su salud y velocidad la hacen un poco más difícil de usar, porque puede morir con bastante facilidad, y es realmente difícil para ella atrapar peleadores más rápidos como Crow. Su poder estelar está un poco roto... |

| Self-Employment Part 1<br/><br/>When you accept an employment in any organisation, you have to perform various jobs as per the requirements of your employer and you may get a fixed amount of income as salary. You may run a small retail shop, tailoring shop, restaurant, bakery and confectionery, beauty salon, etc. in your locality. You may get engaged in trading or manufacturing on a small scale or providing some service for a price. Such economic activities are known as self-employment.<br/><br/>Meaning of Self-Employment<br/><br/>Earning is necessary for a living. Our father, mother, brothers, sisters and others may be engaged in different economic activities through which they earn their livelihood. These persons are engaged in an economic activity which is termed as wage employment or paid employment. But there are many persons who engage themselves in an occupation or some business which they start and manage on their own. They put in their best effort and take all types of risks to pursue their careers successfully. The entire earning of their work goes to them. All of us have seen small grocery shops, tailoring shops, medical stores etc. in our locality. These are owned and managed by a person, with or without the help of some assistants. Their economic activities are termed as self-employment. So, when an individual engages in any economic activity and manages it on his own, it is known as self-employment.<br/><br/>Objectives<br/><br/>After studying this lesson, you will be able to:<br/><br/>Image of Objectives<br/><br/>Image of Objectives<br/><br/>Characteristics of Self-Employment<br/><br/>It involves ownership and management of activities by a person although he/she may take the help of one or two persons to assist him/her. Thus, self-employment may provide employment to other persons as well.<br/><br/>The earning from self-employment is not fixed. It depends on the income one can earn by producing or buying and selling goods or providing services to others at a price.<br/><br/>In self-employment, the owner alone has to take the profit and bear the risk of loss. So, we find a direct link between the effort and reward in self-employment.<br/><br/>It requires some amount of capital investment, although it may be small.<br/><br/>In self-employment, a person is free to take decisions in respect of running his business profitably and avail of any opportunity that may come up for expansion of his business. It gives complete freedom to work as per one's own will and within the parameters of the prevailing laws.<br/><br/>Thus, self-employment may be defined as, an economic activity which one may perform on his own as a gainful occupation, and this may consist of producing and selling goods, buying and selling goods, or rendering services for a price. | Autoempleo Parte 1<br/><br/>Cuando acepta un empleo en cualquier organización, tiene que realizar varios trabajos según los requisitos de su empleador y puede obtener una cantidad fija de ingresos como salario. Puede tener una pequeña tienda minorista, sastrería, restaurante, panadería y confitería, salón de belleza, etc. en su localidad. Puede dedicarse al comercio o la fabricación a pequeña escala o proporcionar algún servicio por un precio. Tales actividades económicas se conocen como autoempleo.<br/><br/>Significado del autoempleo<br/><br/>Nuestro padre, madre, hermanos, hermanas y otras personas pueden participar en diferentes actividades económicas a través de las cuales se ganan la vida. Estas personas se dedican a una actividad económica que se denomina empleo asalariado o empleo remunerado, pero hay muchas personas que se dedican a una ocupación o a algún negocio que inician y gestionan por su cuenta. Ponen su mejor esfuerzo y toman todo tipo de riesgos para seguir sus carreras con éxito. Toda la ganancia de su trabajo va a ellos. Todos hemos visto pequeñas tiendas de comestibles, sastrerías, tiendas médicas, etc. en nuestra localidad. Estos son propiedad y están administrados por una persona, con o sin la ayuda de algunos asistentes. Sus actividades económicas se denominan autoempleo. Por lo tanto, cuando un individuo se dedica a cualquier actividad económica y la administra por su cuenta, se conoce como autoempleo.<br/><br/>Objetivos<br/><br/>Después de estudiar esta lección, usted será capaz de:<br/><br/>Imagen de los objetivos<br/><br/>Imagen de los objetivos<br/><br/>Características del autoempleo<br/><br/>Se trata de la propiedad y la gestión de las actividades por una persona, aunque él / ella puede tomar la ayuda de una o dos personas para ayudarle. Por lo tanto, el trabajo por cuenta propia puede proporcionar empleo a otras personas también.<br/><br/>La ganancia del trabajo por cuenta propia no es fija, sino que depende de los ingresos que uno pueda obtener produciendo o comprando y vendiendo bienes o prestando servicios a otros a un precio.<br/><br/>En el trabajo por cuenta propia, solo el propietario tiene que tomar las ganancias y asumir el riesgo de pérdida. Por lo tanto, encontramos un vínculo directo entre el esfuerzo y la recompensa en el trabajo por cuenta propia.<br/><br/>Requiere cierta cantidad de inversión de capital, aunque puede ser pequeña.<br/><br/>En el trabajo por cuenta propia, una persona es libre de tomar decisiones con respecto a dirigir su negocio de manera rentable y aprovechar cualquier oportunidad que pueda surgir para la expansión de su negocio. Da completa libertad para trabajar según la propia voluntad y dentro de los parámetros de las leyes prevalecientes.<br/><br/>Por lo tanto, el autoempleo puede definirse como una actividad económica que uno puede realizar por sí mismo como una ocupación lucrativa, y esto puede consistir en producir y vender bienes, comprar y vender bienes o prestar servicios por un precio. |
