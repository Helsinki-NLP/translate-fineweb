| The Masterpiece: a Chain Poetry Challenge<br/><br/>John has been writing poetry since his school days. He was awarded the "Best Poet 2014 and 2021" Hubby Awards.<br/><br/>Madame Monet in a Japanese kimono, 1875<br/><br/>Claude Monet [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>A Brief History of Collaborative, Collective, or Chain Poetry<br/><br/>Collaborative,collective, or chain poetry is an alternative and creative technique for writing poetry by more than one person. The principal aim of this type of poetry is to create poems through the collaboration of various authors/poets, trying to form a unified voice while still maintain their individual voices.<br/><br/>Examples of collaboration abound in Japanese poetry. Though the precise accounts and records of many such events are either lost or missing.<br/><br/>One of the most famous examples of collective poetry writing was the poem collection titled Ralentir Travaux by Surrealist French poets André Breton, Paul Éluard and René Char. These three poets collaborated to write the poems in this collection over just five days in 1930.<br/><br/>During the 1940s, Charles Henri Ford, an American poet, invented what he called the "chain poem", where each poet wrote a line and then sent the poem to another person (to continue) in another part of the world, by post.<br/><br/>In 2007 a collection of American collaborative poetry Saints of Hysteria: A Half-Century of Collaborative American Poetry was edited and published by Denise Duhamel, Maureen Seaton and David Trinidad.<br/><br/>Collaborative poetry writing has been used in schools and colleges to teach students teamwork and to discover ways in which they are connected.(source: Wikipedia)<br/><br/>Study of a Figure Outdoors: Woman with a Parasol, facing left, 1886<br/><br/>Claude Monet [Public domain or Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>The Aim of This Article and How to Approach the Challenge<br/><br/>A few years back I wrote an article called "Poem Without an End" which included a Christmas poem I had written that lent itself to being added to. I was amazed by the response as at that stage I only had a few followers here. People wrote a stanza of poetry each in "comments" on the hub to follow on from the previous commenter's stanza. It worked out very well and at the end I compiled all the contributions into a single poem as part of the hub.<br/><br/>Similar challenges have been issued since, including one by Frank Atanacio called "Spirits Sat as Mourners" that was also very successful. The difference being that in that instance contributors wrote their own hubs for their stanza of poetry and placed a link on Frank's original hub.<br/><br/>For this particular challenge I don't expect everyone to spend valuable time writing separate hubs for one stanza of poetry (unless you really want to). The main problem being that to make it effective you would have to copy the previously written parts of the poem onto your hub and would probably be hit with "duplication" label.<br/><br/>So, that being the case, and also to save having to leave links everywhere, I just ask that anyone who wants to take part just write their stanza here in "comments." Check the last comment before yours that is contributing to the challenge and follow on. If I see more than one following from the same stanza I will use my poetic licence to work them in as I deem best.<br/><br/>At some stage when I feel there has been enough stanzas added I will probably call an end to the challenge and then compile them all together as the completed poem as part of the article (also giving credit to each contributor).<br/><br/>Flowered Riverbank, Argenteuil<br/><br/>Claude Monet [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>The Challenge!<br/><br/>Now comes the interesting part. If you join this chain poetry challenge you have to try to keep the style and voice of the poem as close as possible to the preceding verses, so that to uninformed readers it will appear that only one author has written the entire poem.<br/><br/>Sounds easy, you say? Well maybe it would be if the poem had a traditional style, rhyme or meter. But this one doesn't! The poem you will be adding to was started by an acquaintance of mine Andriealphus as a "chain poem challenge" elsewhere. At the time of writing I was the only other person who had accepted the challenge, and because I loved the subject I thought it would be a great challenge for my fellow writers and decided to use it here and see if the response would be better. (I know of a few poets here whose writing would suit this style)<br/><br/>Rules :<br/><br/>Follow on from the previous stanza in comments<br/><br/>Try to retain the voice and style of the poem<br/><br/>Keep your stanza/verse to approximately the same length as those before<br/><br/>Claude Monet was one of the most famous painters in the history of art and a leading figure in the Impressionist movement.<br/><br/>In 1883 Monet moved to Giverny. Here, he loved to paint outdoors in the gardens that he helped create. The water lilies found in the pond had a particular appeal, and he painted several series of them throughout the rest of his life; the Japanese-style bridge over the pond became the subject of several works, as well.<br/><br/>In 1912 Monet painted a series of 12 waterlily paintings commissioned by the Orangerie des Tuileries, a museum in Paris. He chose to make them on a very large scale, and to serve as a "haven of peaceful meditation." This project consumed much of Monet's later years. Monet once stated, "These landscapes of water and reflection have become an obsession for me. It is beyond my strength as an old man, and yet I want to render what I feel."<br/><br/>His health was now an obstacle, as well. Nearly blind, with both of his eyes seriously affected by cataracts, Monet finally agreed to undergo surgery for the ailment in 1923.<br/><br/>Monet's famous water lilies turned redder as his cataracts progressed. After getting corrective surgery he destroyed most of the "red lily" paintings, angry that no one really mentioned it to him. Ironically, these paintings were probably what made his impressionistic style so famous in that time -- artists started taking more risks with color and such during this point. (source: biography.com)<br/><br/>The Masterpiece<br/><br/>"The boy sitting behind you says you look like a masterpiece.<br/><br/>Ask him, has he ever seen a Monet up close?<br/><br/>Close enough to see nothing but muddled strokes of weedy lakeshore?<br/><br/>Close enough to dip his fingers into the ridges<br/><br/>where oil paints hardened under an artist's gaze?<br/><br/>Close enough to breathe onto the blood lilies?<br/><br/>Ask him, why did he paint them red?" (Andriealphus)<br/><br/>He grinned like Carroll's cheshire cat.<br/><br/>"Through clouded and bloodshot eyes I imagine.<br/><br/>Be my waterlilies!" he says,<br/><br/>"Feel my breath and let my fingers delve,<br/><br/>become my masterpiece instead.<br/><br/>A brush has never touched a canvas as fine as your fair skin.<br/><br/>Let the masters weep in jealousy,<br/><br/>and Van Gogh slice his ear in envy at the beauty of your nakedness."(Jodah)<br/><br/>Self portrait with bandaged ear<br/><br/>Vincent van Gogh [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>Responses<br/><br/>Now it's your turn. Please write your response in the comments below, remembering to check those immediately before yours for the last written stanza of the poem. If you do decide to write a separate hub for your stanza of verse, make sure you leave a link here in comments.<br/><br/>The Finished Masterpiece<br/><br/>All contributions have been received and I have put the finished poem together with only some slight edits. I hope everyone is happy with the result. If you think I could improve the order of stanzas etc, feel free to let me know.<br/><br/>Comments<br/><br/>Hey Diana, looks like I have to go add another stanza to the finished poem :)<br/><br/>Thanks for this contribution.Quite beautiful.<br/><br/>Diana L Pierce from Potter County, Pa. on September 19, 2015:<br/><br/>No tears splash water below,<br/><br/>From the bridge beneath his feet,<br/><br/>Nor can his brush paint his thoughts,<br/><br/>From the mystery maid he seeks.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 21, 2015:<br/><br/>Thank you Cris, I am sure everyone appreciates your comment.

And the beauty we can still enjoy today from all his work.<br/><br/>This is a great challenge! I am really looking forward to adding to this.<br/><br/>I first wanted to stop in and let you know that, up for sure. Shared too.<br/><br/>And thank you so much for all the challenges to help the rest of us, keep our mental energy flowing and giving it a work out! You are the best.<br/><br/>The information about LuLu and the free ISBN number is an answered prayer! So, smile my friend. You are a gift!<br/><br/>Hugs. :-)<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 12, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi again Marj. I think I may have all the verses that are going to come. I have been doing my best to arrange them as I think best with just a little editing. I will probably post the finished poem as a separate hub with a link on this one to it. My book is available on Lulu and iBooks...there's a link on one of the earlier comments. I'd really appreciate it if you were to purhase a copy. Bear in mind it's my first eBook so the formatting etc isn't perfect, but it's taken me seven revisions I think to get it where it is. It will all be easier next time. If you need help let me know.<br/><br/>travmaj from australia on August 12, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi John, you have certainly had some excellent responses to your challenge - I'm sure you'll fuse it altogether beautifully although I imagine a difficult task. I'm interested in your poetry books also - I really have to get my act together technologically - I'll try and check it all out...cheers -<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi Jo, both books 'On the Wings of Eagles" and "I Laughed a Smile" have mostly the same content...except the former has one extra poem. Originally they were in different formats, one ePub, the other PDF but now they are both ePub. They are available through Lulu and iBooks, soon Barnes and Noble and Nook (not Amazon). I may try publishing another book through Amazon soon just to see how it compares. Thanks again.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>John, thanks a lot, the info on publishing with Lulu will be quite useful as I'm thinking of publishing but I'm currently torn between Amazon and Lulu. I wanted to purchase one of your books, but I couldn't seem to find them on Amazon. However, I'll probably get it from Lulu. Wishing you every success, you deserve it.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Hey Phyllis, thanks for ontributing. I like it, a perfect ending to the poem I think.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks Faith.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi Jo, I think I have sorted out the poem satisfactorily. Just waiting to see if there is any more to add. Publishing with Lulu wasn't bad and now that I've done it once it will be easier next time. Getting the formatting to look right in the eBook was the hardest, though you and just type it in a word document and Lulu automatically produces the contents page and converts the document to ePub or PDF you can only use certain fonts and have to make sure the chapter names or poem titles are in Heading 1. They also provide a free ISBN number if you want. Overall it was easier than expected however.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Phyllis, this is succinct and beautiful, I love it. Shyron's did an excellent job also, I thought I'd already commented on her verse, but I hadn't.<br/><br/>Phyllis Doyle Burns from High desert of Nevada. on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Wonderful hub, great idea, Jodah. Here is one from me. Short but sweet. Hope it is okay:<br/><br/>And this the beauty be<br/><br/>From Masters past we see<br/><br/>Impressed upon the boy<br/><br/>Bestowed on her with joy<br/><br/>Faith Reaper from southern USA on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks John and Jo. You are kind. Jo, you have always been a brilliant poet. I, too, am looking forward to the end result after John does his magic to pull it all together.<br/><br/>I will share again to see if there are any more takers.<br/><br/>Blessings<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Faith, beautifully done, I find it incredible how someone with such limited vision can teach us so much about beauty, light and shadows. John, looking forward to reading the end result.<br/><br/>By the way, congtats on publishing your poems. How did you find the process of publishing with Lulu?<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks for your great submission Faith. No it's not too late, I'm still compiling the final poem so it should be up for all to see in a day or two.<br/><br/>Faith Reaper from southern USA on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi John,<br/><br/>I apologize for my late submission here to your wonderful challenge. I am off from work a couple of day and decided to give this a go while my husband is resting from knee surgery. If it does not meet with your standards, please feel free to not use it in your final poem or edit as you deem necessary.<br/><br/>Blessings always<br/><br/>Here it goes:<br/><br/>Confessions to friend Georges Clemenceau<br/><br/>Of light encapsulating both torment, joy<br/><br/>Fervent madness in analyzing colors<br/><br/>Consequential spontaneous creations<br/><br/>Season after season of obsession<br/><br/>Capturing different hues in a single moment<br/><br/>Attentive while strolling in Argenteuill<br/><br/>Brushwork bares masterpiece.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 09, 2015:<br/><br/>Just a shout out to see if anyone else still wants to contribute to this chain poem. I have started compiling the stanzas together but will leave it open for a couple more days in case anyone else is intending to join in. Thanks to all who have contributed.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 02, 2015:<br/><br/>Thank you Genna. It appears Monet is a favourite arist of many here. I hope you'll take part in this challenge too :)<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 02, 2015:<br/><br/>Thank you for a great contribution Shyron. This is a very nice verse. Well done.<br/><br/>Genna East from Massachusetts, USA on August 02, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi John...<br/><br/>I started to read this wonderful challenge (Monet is one of my favorite artists), then came back to finish reading some of the beautiful contributions that give this painting a stunning voice through perception and the senses.

I'm so glad you like my contribution. This is a very good idea, I know you'll have fun putting it all together. Take care and my best to you.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks Deb, yes I am impressed by the standard of submissions. I'm looking forward to putting it all together.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Yes Ann, it is good to see the poets among us take up the challenge with some great contributions so far. I just hope Imcan do it justice when it comes to putting it together.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Well done Jo. The word "sublime" comes to mind. I hoped all the poets would rise to the fore, and they have. Love it, thanks for contributing.<br/><br/>Deb Hirt from Stillwater, OK on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>I am excited to see what you end up with here. There are a number of fine poets rising to the challenge, so go to it!<br/><br/>Ann Carr from SW England on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Great one, Jo!<br/><br/>You've got everyone going, John! Rather you than me, putting all this together, but it's going to be a humdinger of a poem when it finally comes to an end - if it ever does! You've really started something.<br/><br/>Ann<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Ok, John here goes nothing! Following from Kim's. I hope it reads well.<br/><br/>And the boy began to walk away<br/><br/>But in his wake, I heard him say<br/><br/>"I took a trip to Orangerie<br/><br/>Where the ghost of Monet still abides<br/><br/>I sat right down and gazed awhile<br/><br/>Until I heard a soft voice cry.<br/><br/>"Have you ever seen a fluid dream?<br/><br/>Where light evolves into what it touch<br/><br/>Where serenity flows through cloudy veil<br/><br/>Where the magician's brush like lightening rush<br/><br/>Have you ever seen a sight sublime?<br/><br/>A child born of distorted illusion<br/><br/>This flowering pond that traps the light<br/><br/>That lift the heart and beckons the soul<br/><br/>An abstract pulchritude up close<br/><br/>Move back, behold; such tranquil delight."<br/><br/>I hope this is in line with what the others have done. Feel free to edit if needed. My best...<br/><br/>Jo.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Alrighty!<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Yes Jo, please do. Anyone is welcome to do more than one stanza. I may add another myself at some stage.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>John, I've decided to have a go, but it's about 16 lines, can I do it in two stanzas following on from Kim's wonderful submission? You can always edit it later.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on July 31, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi Jo, sorry to hear you are under the weather at the moment. I am not in a hurry to close this challenge so I'll keep it open until you are back firing on all cylinders and are able to contribute. You are one of the hubbers I was looking forward to getting a response from as I thought it would suit. Thank you for your kind words, and get well soon.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on July 31, 2015:<br/><br/>Wow! John I can't believe I almost missed your incredible challenged. This is something in which I would have loved to participate since Claude Monet is one of my all times favourite artist. Unfortunately, I must cry off. I'm a bit under the weather with a head full of cotton wool, or so it seems. If the challenge is still open when I get rid of this pesky flu I may give it a go, but I must say, the standard is exceptionally high. Maj took it to another level but all the submissions are brilliant. Kudos to you Andriealphus and the other writers who participated so far in this artistic and creative masterpiece.<br/><br/>My best always Jo.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on July 31, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi again Maj, glad this poem inspired you, and yes it beats watching the cricket especially with the Aussie batsmen performing badly in this third test. It will be an interesting exercise for me to fuse all the stanzas together but should be good.<br/><br/>travmaj from australia on July 30, 2015:<br/><br/>John, thank you, I'm most happy you like my offering. I found the poem intriguing and suddenly felt inspired to write my version in the same mode. I'm not sure I wrote a continuation from the stanza before (alwaysexploring) but I'm sure you will fuse it altogether when the time comes. Love all the responses. I haven't managed any creative writing for yonks, can't wait now to start over, just need some time. (beats watching the cricket too!!!) Cheers John, will be checking in -<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on July 30, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks for checking Dana. I am pleased with the quality of responses so far. I just have to wait and see how many more come in. The final,poem should be great.<br/><br/>Dana Tate from LOS ANGELES on July 30, 2015:<br/><br/>Just checking in to see how things are going, I can't wait for the finished product. I attended a poetry class and we did this also it was really fun.<br/><br/>ocfireflies from North Carolina on July 29, 2015:<br/><br/>John,<br/><br/>Thanks so much for providing the platform for without that it is easy to fall down.<br/><br/>; ) Kim<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on July 29, 2015:<br/><br/>Thank you Devika.

Fue galardonado con el "Mejor Poeta 2014 y 2021" Premios Hubby.<br/><br/>Madame Monet en un kimono japonés, 1875<br/><br/>Claude Monet [Dominio público], vía Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>Breve historia de la poesía colaborativa, colectiva o en cadena<br/><br/>La poesía colaborativa, colectiva o en cadena es una técnica alternativa y creativa para escribir poesía por más de una persona. El objetivo principal de este tipo de poesía es crear poemas a través de la colaboración de varios autores / poetas, tratando de formar una voz unificada sin dejar de mantener sus voces individuales.<br/><br/>Ejemplos de colaboración abundan en la poesía japonesa. Aunque los relatos precisos y los registros de muchos de estos eventos se pierden o faltan.<br/><br/>Uno de los ejemplos más famosos de poesía colectiva fue la colección de poemas titulada Ralentir Travaux por los poetas surrealistas franceses André Breton, Paul Éluard y René Char. Estos tres poetas colaboraron para escribir los poemas en esta colección durante sólo cinco días en 1930.<br/><br/>Durante la década de 1940, Charles Henri Ford, un poeta estadounidense, inventó lo que llamó el "poema en cadena", donde cada poeta escribió una línea y luego envió el poema a otra persona (para continuar) en otra parte del mundo, por correo.<br/><br/>En 2007, una colección de Saints of Hysteria: A Half-Century of Collaborative American Poetry fue editada y publicada por Denise Duhamel, Maureen Seaton y David Trinidad.<br/><br/>La escritura de poesía colaborativa se ha utilizado en escuelas y colegios para enseñar a los estudiantes a trabajar en equipo y descubrir formas en que están conectados.<br/><br/>Estudio de una figura al aire libre: mujer con una sombrilla, mirando a la izquierda, 1886<br/><br/>Claude Monet [Dominio público o dominio público], vía Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>El objetivo de este artículo y cómo abordar el desafío<br/><br/>Hace unos años escribí un artículo llamado "Poema sin final", que incluía un poema de Navidad que había escrito que se prestaba a ser añadido. Me sorprendió la respuesta ya que en ese momento solo tenía unos pocos seguidores aquí. La gente escribió una estrofa de poesía cada una en "comentarios" en el centro para seguir la estrofa del comentarista anterior. Funcionó muy bien y al final compilé todas las contribuciones en un solo poema como parte del centro.<br/><br/>Desafíos similares se han emitido desde entonces, incluyendo uno de Frank Atanacio llamado "Spirits Sat as Mourners" que también tuvo mucho éxito. La diferencia es que en ese caso los colaboradores escribieron sus propios centros para su estrofa de poesía y colocaron un enlace en el centro original de Frank.<br/><br/>Para este desafío en particular, no espero que todos pasen un tiempo valioso escribiendo centros separados para una estrofa de poesía (a menos que realmente quieras). El principal problema es que para que sea efectivo tendrías que copiar las partes previamente escritas del poema en tu centro y probablemente serías golpeado con la etiqueta de "duplicación".<br/><br/>Entonces, siendo ese el caso, y también para ahorrar tener que dejar enlaces en todas partes, solo pido que cualquiera que quiera participar simplemente escriba su estrofa aquí en "comentarios". Compruebe el último comentario antes del suyo que está contribuyendo al desafío y siga. Si veo más de un seguidor de la misma estrofa, usaré mi licencia poética para trabajarlos como mejor me parezca.<br/><br/>En algún momento cuando siento que ha habido suficientes estrofas añadidas probablemente voy a poner fin al desafío y luego compilar todos juntos como el poema completo como parte del artículo (también dando crédito a cada colaborador).<br/><br/>Buscar McDonald's, Argenteuil<br/><br/>Claude Monet [Dominio público], vía Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>¡El desafío!<br/><br/>Ahora viene la parte interesante. Si te unes a este desafío de poesía en cadena, debes tratar de mantener el estilo y la voz del poema lo más cerca posible de los versos anteriores, de modo que para los lectores desinformados parezca que solo un autor ha escrito todo el poema.<br/><br/>¿Suena fácil, dices? Bueno, tal vez lo sería si el poema tuviera un estilo tradicional, rima o metro. ¡Pero este no! El poema al que agregarás fue iniciado por un conocido mío Andriealphus como un "desafío de poema en cadena" en otro lugar. En el momento de escribir este artículo, yo era la única persona que había aceptado el desafío, y como me encantaba el tema, pensé que sería un gran desafío para mis compañeros escritores y decidí usarlo aquí y ver si la respuesta sería mejor.

Los nenúfares encontrados en el estanque tenían un atractivo particular, y pintó varias series de ellos durante el resto de su vida; el puente de estilo japonés sobre el estanque también se convirtió en objeto de varias obras.<br/><br/>En 1912, Monet pintó una serie de 12 pinturas de nenúfares encargadas por la Orangerie des Tuileries, un museo en París, y decidió hacerlas a gran escala y servir como un "refugio de meditación pacífica". Este proyecto consumió gran parte de los últimos años de Monet. Monet dijo una vez: "Estos paisajes de agua y reflexión se han convertido en una obsesión para mí. Está más allá de mi fuerza como anciano, y sin embargo quiero representar lo que siento".<br/><br/>Casi ciego, con los dos ojos gravemente afectados por las cataratas, Monet finalmente aceptó someterse a una cirugía para la dolencia en 1923.<br/><br/>Los famosos nenúfares de Monet se volvieron más rojos a medida que avanzaban sus cataratas. Después de someterse a una cirugía correctiva, destruyó la mayoría de las pinturas de "lirio rojo", enojado porque nadie realmente se lo mencionó. Irónicamente, estas pinturas fueron probablemente lo que hizo que su estilo impresionista fuera tan famoso en ese momento: los artistas comenzaron a tomar más riesgos con el color y cosas así durante este punto.<br/><br/>La obra maestra<br/><br/>El chico que está sentado detrás de ti dice que pareces una obra maestra.<br/><br/>Pregúntale, ¿ha visto alguna vez un Monet de cerca?<br/><br/>¿Lo suficientemente cerca como para ver nada más que trazos confusos de la orilla del lago?<br/><br/>Lo suficientemente cerca como para sumergir sus dedos en las crestas<br/><br/>donde las pinturas al óleo se endurecen bajo la mirada de un artista?<br/><br/>¿Lo suficientemente cerca como para respirar en los lirios de sangre?<br/><br/>Pregúntenle, ¿por qué los pintó de rojo?”<br/><br/>Sonrió como el gato de Carroll.<br/><br/>"A través de ojos nublados y inyectados de sangre, me imagino.<br/><br/>¡Sean mis nenúfares!”, dice.<br/><br/>"Siente mi aliento y deja que mis dedos ahonden,<br/><br/>Conviértete en mi obra maestra en su lugar.<br/><br/>Un pincel nunca ha tocado un lienzo tan fino como su piel clara.<br/><br/>Que los amos lloren de celos,<br/><br/>y Van Gogh se corta la oreja con envidia ante la belleza de tu desnudez”.<br/><br/>Autorretrato con oreja vendada<br/><br/>Vincent van Gogh [Dominio público], vía Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>Respuestas<br/><br/>Ahora es tu turno.

Creo que puedo tener todos los versos que van a venir. He estado haciendo todo lo posible para organizarlos como creo que mejor con solo un poco de edición. Probablemente publicaré el poema terminado como un centro separado con un enlace en este. Mi libro está disponible en Lulu e iBooks... hay un enlace en uno de los comentarios anteriores. Realmente apreciaría si tuvieras que purhase una copia. Tenga en cuenta que es mi primer libro electrónico, por lo que el formato, etc. no es perfecto, pero me ha llevado siete revisiones, creo, para llevarlo a donde está. La próxima vez todo será más fácil. Si necesita ayuda, hágamelo saber.<br/><br/>travmaj de australia el agosto 12, 2015:<br/><br/>Hola John, ciertamente has tenido algunas respuestas excelentes a tu desafío, estoy seguro de que lo fusionarás maravillosamente, aunque imagino que será una tarea difícil. Estoy interesado en sus libros de poesía también - que realmente tengo que conseguir mi acto juntos tecnológicamente - voy a tratar de comprobar todo ...<br/><br/>John Hansen (autor) de Gondwana Land el 11 de agosto de 2015:<br/><br/>Hola Jo, ambos libros 'On the Wings of Eagles' y "I Laughed a Smile" tienen en su mayoría el mismo contenido... excepto que el primero tiene un poema extra. Originalmente estaban en diferentes formatos, un ePub, el otro PDF pero ahora ambos son ePub. Están disponibles a través de Lulu e iBooks, pronto Barnes and Noble y Nook (no Amazon). Puedo intentar publicar otro libro a través de Amazon pronto solo para ver cómo se compara. Gracias de nuevo.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues de Lincolnshire, Reino Unido el 11 de agosto de 2015:<br/><br/>John, muchas gracias, la información sobre la publicación con Lulu será muy útil ya que estoy pensando en publicar, pero actualmente estoy dividido entre Amazon y Lulu. Quería comprar uno de sus libros, pero parece que no pude encontrarlos en Amazon. Sin embargo, probablemente lo conseguiré de Lulu, deseándote todo el éxito, te lo mereces.<br/><br/>John Hansen (autor) de Gondwana Land el 11 de agosto de 2015:<br/><br/>Hey Phyllis, gracias por onttribuir.

Solo espero a ver si hay más para agregar. Publicar con Lulu no fue malo y ahora que lo he hecho una vez será más fácil la próxima vez. Obtener el formato para que se vea bien en el libro electrónico fue el más difícil, aunque usted y solo escriba en un documento de Word y Lulu produce automáticamente la página de contenido y convierte el documento a ePub o PDF, solo puede usar ciertas fuentes y debe asegurarse de que los nombres de los capítulos o títulos de los poemas estén en el título 1. También proporcionan un número ISBN gratuito si lo desea. Sin embargo, en general fue más fácil de lo esperado.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues de Lincolnshire, Reino Unido el 11 de agosto de 2015:<br/><br/>Phyllis, esto es sucinto y hermoso, me encanta.

Eres amable. Jo, siempre has sido un poeta brillante. Yo también espero con ansias el resultado final después de que John haga su magia para unirlo todo.<br/><br/>Voy a compartir de nuevo para ver si hay más compradores.<br/><br/>Bendiciones<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues de Lincolnshire, Reino Unido el 10 de agosto de 2015:<br/><br/>La fe, bellamente hecha, me parece increíble cómo alguien con una visión tan limitada puede enseñarnos tanto sobre la belleza, la luz y las sombras. John, esperando leer el resultado final.<br/><br/>Por cierto, congtats en la publicación de sus poemas. ¿Cómo encontró el proceso de publicación con Lulu?<br/><br/>John Hansen (autor) de Gondwana Land el 10 de agosto de 2015:<br/><br/>Gracias por tu gran sumisión Faith. No, no es demasiado tarde, todavía estoy compilando el poema final, así que debería estar listo para que todos lo vean en un día o dos.<br/><br/>Faith Reaper del sur de Estados Unidos el 10 de agosto de 2015:<br/><br/>Hola John,<br/><br/>Me disculpo por mi sumisión tardía aquí a su maravilloso desafío. Estoy fuera del trabajo un par de días y decidí darle una oportunidad mientras mi marido está descansando de la cirugía de rodilla. Si no cumple con sus estándares, no dude en no usarlo en su poema final o editarlo como considere necesario.<br/><br/>Bendiciones siempre<br/><br/>Aquí va:<br/><br/>Confesiones a mi amigo Georges Clemenceau<br/><br/>De luz encapsulando tanto tormento, alegría<br/><br/>Ferviente locura en el análisis de los colores<br/><br/>Creaciones espontáneas consecuentes<br/><br/>Temporada tras temporada de obsesión<br/><br/>Captura diferentes tonos en un solo momento<br/><br/>Atento mientras pasea por Argenteuil<br/><br/>Pincel desnuda obra maestra.<br/><br/>John Hansen (autor) de Gondwana Land el 09 de agosto de 2015:<br/><br/>Solo un grito para ver si alguien más todavía quiere contribuir a este poema en cadena. He comenzado a compilar las estrofas juntos, pero lo dejaré abierto por un par de días más en caso de que alguien más tenga la intención de unirse. Gracias a todos los que han contribuido.<br/><br/>John Hansen (autor) de Gondwana Land el 02 de agosto de 2015:<br/><br/>Gracias Genna. Parece que Monet es uno de los aristas favoritos de muchos aquí. Espero que también participes en este desafío :)<br/><br/>John Hansen (autor) de Gondwana Land el 02 de agosto de 2015:<br/><br/>Gracias por una gran contribución Shyron. Este es un verso muy agradable. Bien hecho.<br/><br/>Genna East de Massachusetts, EE.UU. el 02 de agosto de 2015:<br/><br/>Hola John...<br/><br/>Comencé a leer este maravilloso desafío (Monet es uno de mis artistas favoritos), luego volví para terminar de leer algunas de las hermosas contribuciones que le dan a esta pintura una voz impresionante a través de la percepción y los sentidos.

Estoy muy contento de que te guste mi contribución. Esta es una muy buena idea, sé que te divertirás poniéndolo todo junto. Cuídate y lo mejor para ti.<br/><br/>John Hansen (autor) de Gondwana Land el 01 de agosto de 2015:<br/><br/>Gracias Deb, sí, estoy impresionado por el estándar de las presentaciones. Estoy deseando ponerlo todo junto.<br/><br/>John Hansen (autor) de Gondwana Land el 01 de agosto de 2015:<br/><br/>Sí Ann, es bueno ver a los poetas entre nosotros asumir el desafío con algunas grandes contribuciones hasta ahora. Solo espero que Imcan le haga justicia cuando se trata de armarlo.<br/><br/>John Hansen (autor) de Gondwana Land el 01 de agosto de 2015:<br/><br/>Bien hecho Jo. Me viene a la mente la palabra "sublime". Esperaba que todos los poetas se pusieran en primer plano, y lo han hecho. Me encanta, gracias por contribuir.<br/><br/>Deb Hirt de Stillwater, OK el 01 de agosto de 2015:<br/><br/>Estoy emocionado de ver con lo que terminas aquí.

Realmente has comenzado algo.<br/><br/>Ann<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues de Lincolnshire, Reino Unido el 01 de agosto de 2015:<br/><br/>Bien, John aquí no va nada! Siguiendo de Kim. Espero que se lea bien.<br/><br/>Y el muchacho comenzó a alejarse<br/><br/>Pero en su estela, le oí decir<br/><br/>"Hice un viaje a Orangerie<br/><br/>Donde el fantasma de Monet aún permanece<br/><br/>Me senté y miré un rato<br/><br/>Hasta que oí una voz suave llorar.<br/><br/>¿Alguna vez has visto un sueño fluido?<br/><br/>Donde la luz evoluciona en lo que toca<br/><br/>Donde la serenidad fluye a través del velo nublado<br/><br/>Donde el pincel del mago como rayo se apresura<br/><br/>¿Alguna vez has visto una vista sublime?<br/><br/>Un niño nacido de una ilusión distorsionada<br/><br/>Este estanque floreciente que atrapa la luz<br/><br/>Que levanta el corazón y llama al alma<br/><br/>Una pulcritud abstracta de cerca<br/><br/>Retrocedan, he aquí; tan tranquilo deleite.<br/><br/>Espero que esto esté en línea con lo que los demás han hecho. Siéntase libre de editar si es necesario. Mi mejor...<br/><br/>Jo.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues de Lincolnshire, Reino Unido el 01 de agosto de 2015:<br/><br/>¡Muy bien!<br/><br/>John Hansen (autor) de Gondwana Land el 01 de agosto de 2015:<br/><br/>Sí Jo, por favor hazlo. Cualquiera es bienvenido a hacer más de una estrofa. Puedo agregar otra yo mismo en algún momento.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues de Lincolnshire, Reino Unido el 01 de agosto de 2015:<br/><br/>John, he decidido intentarlo, pero se trata de 16 líneas, ¿puedo hacerlo en dos estrofas después de la maravillosa presentación de Kim? Siempre puedes editarlo más tarde.<br/><br/>John Hansen (autor) de Gondwana Land el 31 de julio de 2015:<br/><br/>Hola Jo, lamento escuchar que estás bajo el clima en este momento. No tengo prisa por cerrar este desafío, así que lo mantendré abierto hasta que vuelvas a disparar con todos los cilindros y puedas contribuir. Usted es uno de los hubbers que estaba deseando obtener una respuesta de como pensé que sería adecuado. Gracias por sus amables palabras, y ponerse bien pronto.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues de Lincolnshire, Reino Unido el 31 de julio de 2015:<br/><br/>¡Wow! John No puedo creer que casi me perdí su increíble desafío. Esto es algo en lo que me hubiera encantado participar ya que Claude Monet es uno de mis artistas favoritos de todos los tiempos. Desafortunadamente, debo llorar. Estoy un poco bajo el clima con una cabeza llena de algodón, o eso parece. Si el desafío todavía está abierto cuando me deshago de esta molesta gripe, puedo intentarlo, pero debo decir que el estándar es excepcionalmente alto. Maj lo llevó a otro nivel, pero todas las presentaciones son brillantes. Gracias a ti Andriealphus y a los otros escritores que participaron hasta ahora en esta obra maestra artística y creativa.<br/><br/>Mi mejor siempre Jo.<br/><br/>John Hansen (autor) de Gondwana Land el 31 de julio de 2015:<br/><br/>Hola de nuevo Maj, me alegro de que este poema te haya inspirado, y sí, es mejor ver el grillo especialmente con los bateadores australianos actuando mal en esta tercera prueba. Será un ejercicio interesante para mí fusionar todas las estrofas, pero debería ser bueno.<br/><br/>travmaj de australia el julio 30, 2015:<br/><br/>John, gracias, estoy muy feliz de que te guste mi ofrenda. Encontré el poema intrigante y de repente me sentí inspirado a escribir mi versión de la misma manera. No estoy seguro de haber escrito una continuación de la estrofa antes (siempre explorando), pero estoy seguro de que lo fusionarás por completo cuando llegue el momento. No he logrado ninguna escritura creativa para yonks, no puedo esperar ahora para empezar de nuevo, solo necesito algo de tiempo.<br/><br/>John Hansen (autor) de Gondwana Land el 30 de julio de 2015:<br/><br/>Gracias por revisar Dana. Estoy satisfecho con la calidad de las respuestas hasta ahora. Solo tengo que esperar y ver cuántos más entran. El final, el poema debería ser genial.<br/><br/>Dana Tate de LOS ANGELES el 30 de julio de 2015:<br/><br/>Solo ver cómo van las cosas, no puedo esperar por el producto terminado. Asistí a una clase de poesía y lo hicimos también fue muy divertido.<br/><br/>ocfiriflies de Carolina del Norte el 29 de julio de 2015:<br/><br/>John,<br/><br/>Muchas gracias por proporcionar la plataforma para sin que sea fácil caer.<br/><br/>; ) Kim<br/><br/>John Hansen (autor) de Gondwana Land el 29 de julio de 2015:<br/><br/>Gracias Devika, hace tiempo que no te veo, espero que todo esté bien.<br/><br/>John Hansen (autor) de Gondwana Land el 29 de julio de 2015:<br/><br/>Hermoso trabajo Kim.

Estoy muy satisfecho con la calidad de las respuestas hasta ahora.<br/><br/>ocfiriflies de Carolina del Norte el 29 de julio de 2015:<br/><br/>John,<br/><br/>Había enviado esto antes de la impresionante contribución de travmaj, pero tal vez todavía funciona (Hice un poco de ajuste)<br/><br/>siguiente en lugar de anterior - no sé si<br/><br/>Estoy haciendo cualquier sentido. Si no funciona, sienta por favor libre de borrar e intentaré otra vez. |

| First of all EEQT itself needs to be further developed in order to provide a theoretical and computational answer to the needs of modern quantum engineering<br/>and technology. We need to include classical systems with infinite<br/>numbers of degrees of freedom - like electromagnetic and/or gravitational<br/>field. We also need to include infinite quantum systems so as<br/>to understand and simulate Bose gas and its phase transitions. But, there<br/>are also steps that must be taken far beyond the paradigm of EEQT.<br/>As we have emphasized so many times: quantum theory has yet<br/>to be understood in terms of a "non-linear classical theory." But what we mean by a "classical theory" is something much more advanced and more<br/>general than clasical mechanics or classical field theory. By a "classical theory" we mean first of all, a theory that is not based<br/>on probabilities from the start; a theory in which probabilities appear at a<br/>later stage, derived from the theory; derived perhaps, in a necessary way. Such a theory must not only specify the mathematical objects and their relations but also make "predictions".<br/>A classical theory is, in particular, a theory in which discrete events can happen, events that are "objective." They may be events that affect mainly the physical stratum, but they may be also "mental<br/>events," changes of states of "consciousness;" whatever they are, even if they<br/>are concerned with branchings of universes, - they DO HAPPEN.<br/>Such a theory, encompassing the quantum theory as we know it today,<br/>does not yet exist, but we can envisage its possible shape. Nothing serves better than an example, so let us give here an example of how<br/>such a theory can be construed.<br/>Imagine a theory developed a'la Einstein's unified field theory, but<br/>with variable metric signature, possibly with a complex causal web, multiple<br/>Einstein-Rosen [40] (see also [41]) bridges,<br/>time loops, nondifferrentiability, fractal structure, all of that additionally complicated by variable dimensionality of space and of "time" (cf [42]. Imagine such a theory to be able to accomodate all the four fundamental<br/>forces known to us, but it also involves an extra field, which is different<br/>from physical fields, and which is non-local in the sense that it does not<br/>survive taking a macro-average-limit when causal space-time<br/>structure of Einstein's general relativity is recovered. This extra field<br/>would be a place for "thought forms" and our theory would couple these<br/>thought forms to more "physical" levels of reality. The very concept of<br/>"time" would arise only in one particular limiting structure. Nothing<br/>prevents a theory of such a type to have mathematical structures rich enough to accomodate consciousness and mind. Due to its complexity,<br/>density of time-loops, bubble-like causal structure, making predictions<br/>in such theory is possible only by applying probability -<br/>as it is the case with systems evolving according to deterministic<br/>but chaotic dynamics. Quantum wave function would emerge in such a<br/>theory as an effective way of predicting. That type of explanation<br/>of quantum indeterminism was postulated long ago by I. J. Good. In<br/>[3] he speculated that<br/>quantum indeterminism can be understood if we admit that individual quantum events that actually happen here and now have future<br/>advanced causes as well has past retarded causes.<br/>A glimpse of such a thought<br/>may have occured to Alan Turing when he wrote his famous, already quoted sentence: "prediction must be linear, description must be nonlinear."<br/>A theory going partially in this direction is being developed by L. Nottale<br/>[43] who states the observation, attributed to Feynman, that "the typical paths of quantum mechanical particles are continuous non-differentiable." Then he continues his development of fractal<br/>space-time ideas to conclude with: "The quantum behavior becomes, in this theory,<br/>a manifestation of the fractal geometry of space-time, in the same way gravitation is, in Einstein's theory of general (motion-)relativity, a manifestation of the curvature of space-time.<br/>Another step in this direction comes from the work of Russian scientists - which started with the most original ideas of N.A. Kozyrev [44]<br/>and A. Sakharov [45], and is being developed in Moscow, the Urals and Siberia, see e.g. [46, 47, 48]. | En primer lugar, EEQT necesita desarrollarse aún más para proporcionar una respuesta teórica y computacional a las necesidades de la ingeniería y tecnología cuántica moderna. Necesitamos incluir sistemas clásicos con un número infinito de grados de libertad, como el campo electromagnético y / o gravitacional. También necesitamos incluir sistemas cuánticos infinitos para comprender y simular el gas Bose y sus transiciones de fase. Pero también hay pasos que deben tomarse mucho más allá del paradigma de la EEQT.<br/>Como hemos enfatizado tantas veces: la teoría cuántica aún no se ha entendido en términos de una "teoría clásica no lineal". Pero lo que entendemos por "teoría clásica" es algo mucho más avanzado y más general que la mecánica clásica o la teoría de campo clásica. Por "teoría clásica" entendemos en primer lugar, una teoría que no se basa en probabilidades desde el principio; una teoría en la que las probabilidades aparecen en una etapa posterior, derivada de la teoría; derivada tal vez, de una manera necesaria. Tal teoría no sólo debe especificar los objetos matemáticos y sus relaciones, sino también hacer "predicciones".<br/>Una teoría clásica es, en particular, una teoría en la que pueden ocurrir eventos discretos, eventos que son "objetivos". Pueden ser eventos que afectan principalmente al estrato físico, pero también pueden ser "eventos mentales", cambios de estados de "conciencia"; sean lo que sean, incluso si están interesados en ramificaciones de universos, OCURREN.<br/>Tal teoría, que abarca la teoría cuántica tal como la conocemos hoy en día, aún no existe, pero podemos prever su posible forma. Nada sirve mejor que un ejemplo, así que demos aquí un ejemplo de cómo se puede interpretar tal teoría.<br/>Imaginemos que una teoría desarrollase la teoría del campo unificado de Einstein, pero con una firma métrica variable, posiblemente con una red causal compleja, múltiple.<br/>Einstein-Rosen [40] (véase también [41]) puentes, bucles de tiempo, no diferenciabilidad, estructura fractal, todo eso adicionalmente complicado por la dimensionalidad variable del espacio y del "tiempo" (véase [42]. Imaginemos tal teoría para poder acomodar las cuatro fuerzas fundamentales conocidas por nosotros, pero también involucra un campo extra, que es diferente de los campos físicos, y que no es local en el sentido de que no sobrevive tomando un límite macro-promedio cuando se recupera la estructura espacio-tiempo causal de la relatividad general de Einstein. Este campo adicional sería un lugar para "formas de pensamiento" y nuestra teoría uniría estas formas de pensamiento a niveles más "físicos" de la realidad.<br/>Nada impide que una teoría de este tipo tenga estructuras matemáticas lo suficientemente ricas como para acomodar la conciencia y la mente. Debido a su complejidad, la densidad de los bucles de tiempo, la estructura causal similar a una burbuja, hacer predicciones en tal teoría es posible solo aplicando la probabilidad.<br/>como es el caso con los sistemas que evolucionan según la dinámica determinista pero caótica. La función de onda cuántica emergería en tal teoría como una forma efectiva de predecir. Ese tipo de explicación del indeterminismo cuántico fue postulado hace mucho tiempo por I. J. Good.<br/>Especuló que el indeterminismo cuántico se puede entender si admitimos que los eventos cuánticos individuales que realmente ocurren aquí y ahora tienen causas avanzadas futuras también tienen causas retardadas en el pasado.<br/>Puede que se le haya ocurrido un atisbo de tal pensamiento a Alan Turing cuando escribió su famosa frase, ya citada: "la predicción debe ser lineal, la descripción debe ser no lineal".<br/>Una teoría que va parcialmente en esta dirección está siendo desarrollada por L. Nottale<br/>Quien afirma la observación, atribuida a Feynman, que "los caminos típicos de partículas mecánicas cuánticas son continuos no diferenciables". El comportamiento cuántico se convierte, en esta teoría, en una manifestación de la geometría fractal del espacio-tiempo, de la misma manera que la gravitación es, en la teoría de la (movimiento-)relatividad general de Einstein, una manifestación de la curvatura del espacio-tiempo.<br/>Otro paso en esta dirección proviene del trabajo de los científicos rusos - que comenzó con las ideas más originales de NA Kozyrev [44]<br/>y A. Sajarov [45], y se está desarrollando en Moscú, los Urales y Siberia, ver por ejemplo [46, 47, 48]. |
| Best Nutrition And Exercise For Lose Weight<br/><br/>How is breakfast really healthy?<br/><br/>In the morning like an emperor, at noon like a king, in the evening like a beggar – goes a well-known proverb. A study by the medical organization Endocrine Society confirms the key message behind the saying: It shows that breakfast plays a more important role than is often assumed. In the morning, the human body actually has more than twice as high a metabolic activity as at other times of the day: A large breakfast not only keeps you full for a long time, blood sugar and insulin levels also rise slowly. The appetite for sweets is regulated, we eat snacks less often during the day. Therefore, breakfast should not be skipped even during a diet.<br/><br/>Of course, having a big breakfast doesn't mean that we should have several croissants with nut nougat cream and sweet breakfast pancakes in the morning. Breakfast is healthy best when it is high in protein and fiber, as well as providing vitamins and minerals. Whole grain bread or muesli, oat flakes, fruits and nuts are energy suppliers that are good for you and keep you full for a long time.<br/><br/>The fact that a large breakfast is better than a large dinner does not necessarily mean that breakfast is essential for losing weight. A meta-analysis carried out in 2019 showed, that the total daily energy intake of people who eat breakfast is on average higher, than that of those who do not have breakfast. The latter were on average just under half a kilo lighter. So, according to the results of this major study, you don't necessarily have to eat breakfast if you want to lose weight.<br/><br/>Lose weight with the right diet – that's how easy it is to put healthy on your plate<br/><br/>Eating healthy in no way means less taste. Fresh vegetables, fish or meat as protein sources and other healthy ingredients conjure up taste in the pot and a smile on your lips – ideally also when you step on the scales. A US study has shown that people who cook their own food and consciously deal with what they eat have a body mass index in the normal range. Restaurant visits or fast food, on the other hand, quickly lure you into the sugar trap: Often there is no indication of how much sugar is in salad dressings, how much fat the potatoes were fried in or whether the meat was not treated.<br/><br/>A healthy lunch consists of three parts – the largest part is fruits or vegetables and should cover half of the plate. A quarter of the meal should consist of protein, i.e. fish, meat or tofu. The remaining quarter consists of carbohydrates and is ideally made from whole grain products. Important: Don't eat at your desk in the office, but stimulate your metabolism and ideally take a short walk before or after lunch.<br/><br/>When should you eat to lose weight?<br/><br/>In the evening, you should focus on light meals that are rather low in carbohydrates. These are the least likely to cause insulin to skyrocket, which is good for our body. Vegetables, dairy products and nuts, for example, are well suited for this.<br/><br/>You should also be careful not to have dinner too late. It is best to have eaten until 7 p.m. – then the body can relax and prepare for the night. Sufficient sleep is important for healthy weight loss. A US study found that people who slept about eight hours a night had better fat deposits. So good night! Allow yourself more than six hours of sleep so that you can start the next day fit and refreshed.<br/><br/>Losing weight without exercise – is it really possible?<br/><br/>It would be so easy, if the dream weight could be achieved simply by lowering the calorie intake. But you probably know the wisdom that diet is only one side of the coin and exercise is the other. So nothing helps: Put on your sportswear and off you go!<br/><br/>Anyone who, in addition to the sports program such as jogging, walking or swimming, also lets the elevator go alone and takes the stairs, takes a little detour or uses the bike instead of the car, is doing wellis also called something good. Even simple walking is good for health. | La mejor nutrición y ejercicio para perder peso<br/><br/>¿Cómo es el desayuno realmente saludable?<br/><br/>Por la mañana como un emperador, al mediodía como un rey, por la noche como un mendigo, dice un conocido proverbio. Un estudio de la organización médica Endocrine Society confirma el mensaje clave detrás del dicho: muestra que el desayuno juega un papel más importante de lo que a menudo se asume. Por la mañana, el cuerpo humano tiene una actividad metabólica más del doble que en otros momentos del día: un gran desayuno no solo lo mantiene lleno durante mucho tiempo, los niveles de azúcar en la sangre y la insulina también aumentan lentamente. El apetito por los dulces está regulado, comemos bocadillos con menos frecuencia durante el día. Por lo tanto, el desayuno no debe omitirse incluso durante una dieta.<br/><br/>Por supuesto, tener un gran desayuno no significa que debamos tener varios cruasanes con crema de turrón de nueces y panqueques dulces para el desayuno por la mañana. El desayuno es saludable cuando es rico en proteínas y fibra, además de proporcionar vitaminas y minerales. Pan integral o muesli, copos de avena, frutas y nueces son proveedores de energía que son buenos para usted y lo mantienen lleno durante mucho tiempo.<br/><br/>El hecho de que un desayuno grande sea mejor que una cena grande no significa necesariamente que el desayuno sea esencial para perder peso. Un metaanálisis realizado en 2019 mostró que la ingesta energética diaria total de las personas que desayunan es en promedio más alta que la de las que no desayunan, estas últimas un poco menos de medio kilo más ligeras. Por lo tanto, de acuerdo con los resultados de este importante estudio, no necesariamente tiene que desayunar si desea perder peso.<br/><br/>Perder peso con la dieta correcta: así de fácil es poner saludable en su plato<br/><br/>Comer sano de ninguna manera significa menos sabor. Las verduras frescas, el pescado o la carne como fuentes de proteínas y otros ingredientes saludables evocan el sabor en la olla y una sonrisa en los labios, idealmente también cuando pisas la báscula. Un estudio estadounidense ha demostrado que las personas que cocinan sus propios alimentos y se ocupan conscientemente de lo que comen tienen un índice de masa corporal en el rango normal. Las visitas al restaurante o la comida rápida, por otro lado, lo atraen rápidamente a la trampa de azúcar: a menudo no hay indicios de cuánta azúcar hay en los aderezos para ensaladas, cuánta grasa se fríen las papas o si la carne no se trata.<br/><br/>Un almuerzo saludable consta de tres partes: la mayor parte son frutas o verduras y debe cubrir la mitad del plato. Una cuarta parte de la comida debe consistir en proteínas, es decir, pescado, carne o tofu. Importante: No coma en su escritorio en la oficina, sino que estimule su metabolismo e idealmente dé un corto paseo antes o después del almuerzo.<br/><br/>¿Cuándo debes comer para perder peso?<br/><br/>Por la noche, debe centrarse en las comidas ligeras que son bastante bajas en carbohidratos. Estos son los menos propensos a causar que la insulina se dispare, lo cual es bueno para nuestro cuerpo. Las verduras, los productos lácteos y las nueces, por ejemplo, son muy adecuados para esto.<br/><br/>También debe tener cuidado de no cenar demasiado tarde. Lo mejor es haber comido hasta las 7 p.m. – entonces el cuerpo puede relajarse y prepararse para la noche. Dormir lo suficiente es importante para una pérdida de peso saludable. Un estudio estadounidense encontró que las personas que dormían unas ocho horas por noche tenían mejores depósitos de grasa. ¡Así que buenas noches! Permítete dormir más de seis horas para que puedas comenzar el día siguiente en forma y fresco.<br/><br/>Perder peso sin hacer ejercicio, ¿es realmente posible?<br/><br/>Sería tan fácil, si el peso del sueño se pudiera lograr simplemente reduciendo la ingesta de calorías. Pero probablemente conozca la sabiduría de que la dieta es solo una cara de la moneda y el ejercicio es la otra. Así que nada ayuda: ¡Ponte tu ropa deportiva y listo!<br/><br/>Cualquier persona que, además del programa deportivo como trotar, caminar o nadar, también deja que el ascensor vaya solo y toma las escaleras, toma un pequeño desvío o usa la bicicleta en lugar del automóvil, también se llama algo bueno. Incluso caminar es bueno para la salud. |
| Why We Open Sourced the Anvil App Server<br/><br/>Why Open Source?<br/><br/>A little while ago, we open-sourced the Anvil App Server. The community reaction has been great, even a little overwhelming (yes, every reply to that announcement really did land in my inbox!). We've already incorporated a bunch of that feedback into our version 1.2 release. But we keep getting asked, " Why did you open-source such a core part of your product? "<br/><br/>Why do this at all?<br/><br/>Anvil is a tool that makes it as simple as possible to build a web app. We do that by enabling you to build the whole application in one language, Python.<br/><br/>Simple hosting is part of that.<br/><br/>The web platform is broken , and Anvil is our attempt to fix it. And, because there is so much complexity in deploying a web app, a cloud-hosted service was the best way to provide the simplicity we want. That way, you can build your app in the Anvil Editor, and make it live on the Internet with one click.<br/><br/>But we kept hearing from people who said, "that's great, but…"<br/><br/>"…but I need to run this on an offshore platform without reliable internet access"<br/><br/>"…but I want to package my app into an IoT device I sell"<br/><br/>or simply, "…but if I'm putting my eggs in this basket, how can I be sure I can still run my app in ten years' time?"<br/><br/>These are all good points! A cloud service isn't the right solution for everyone. If we want to serve these users, there's got to be some way for them to get their apps out of Anvil and run them locally, under their own complete control.<br/><br/>Open Source: Escape hatch, not an ejector seat<br/><br/>We believe in escape hatches, not ejector seats. At conferences, we sometimes get asked, "can I export this as a Flask+JS app?". Sure, it would be possible – we could generate a server package, compile the client-side Python to Javascript, and spit out a classic web app. But it would have serious drawbacks, because:<br/><br/>Not a comfy ride.<br/><br/>Code generation is an ejector seat. Generated code is better than nothing – at least you can edit it! But the moment you edit that code, you lose all the benefits of the system that generated it. If you're using Anvil because of its drag-and-drop editor and Python in the browser, why should our locally-hosted users have to use vim and Javascript?<br/><br/>So we did it the right way: we open-sourced Anvil's runtime engine. It's the same code that serves your app in our hosted service, and it represents your app the same way. You can edit your code with a text editor, run it, then git push it back into our online IDE. It's not an ejector seat: there's no explosive transition. It's an escape hatch: you can climb out, and climb right back in.<br/><br/>What about our business model?<br/><br/>Anvil was never meant to be one of those enterprise low-code systems that charge you $20/mo for each person who uses your app. Anvil is a developer tool. The apps you develop are yours. Enabling you to run them on a Raspberry Pi is cool, but it doesn't change our business model.<br/><br/>We're doing what we always were: We make and sell a development tool that makes it drastically simpler to build web applications. We provide hosting for Anvil apps. We offer the entire development-and-hosting platform on-site for enterprise customers. And, of course, we offer a free plan so that everyone can use Anvil for hobby or educational purposes – or to start building something and see how it goes.<br/><br/>We've open-sourced the Anvil App Server for the (relatively small) number of people who need it, and to provide the ultimate insurance policy. Sure, you can build an app with vim and host it yourself, without even registering an account with us (we've got docs to show you how!). But the Anvil Editor is the world's easiest way to build a web app, and our hosted service is the easiest way to deploy it – so that's what we expect most of our users to continue doing. And you can build with confidence, knowing that the open-source code is right there if you need it.<br/><br/>Try it yourself<br/><br/>If our development philosophy resonates with you, why not try Anvil yourself? | Por qué abrimos el Anvil App Server<br/><br/>¿Por qué Open Source?<br/><br/>Hace un tiempo, abrimos el Anvil App Server. La reacción de la comunidad ha sido genial, incluso un poco abrumadora (¡sí, cada respuesta a ese anuncio realmente llegó a mi bandeja de entrada!). Ya hemos incorporado un montón de esa retroalimentación en nuestra versión 1.2. Pero seguimos siendo preguntados, "¿Por qué de código abierto una parte tan central de su producto?"<br/><br/>¿Por qué hacer esto?<br/><br/>Anvil es una herramienta que hace que sea lo más simple posible construir una aplicación web. Lo hacemos al permitirle construir toda la aplicación en un idioma, Python.<br/><br/>El alojamiento simple es parte de eso.<br/><br/>La plataforma web está rota, y Anvil es nuestro intento de solucionarlo. Y, debido a que hay tanta complejidad en la implementación de una aplicación web, un servicio alojado en la nube era la mejor manera de proporcionar la simplicidad que queremos. De esa manera, puede crear su aplicación en Anvil Editor y hacerla en vivo en Internet con un solo clic.<br/><br/>Pero seguimos escuchando de personas que dijeron: "Eso es genial, pero..."<br/><br/>"...pero necesito ejecutar esto en una plataforma offshore sin acceso confiable a Internet"<br/><br/>"...pero quiero empaquetar mi aplicación en un dispositivo IoT que vendo"<br/><br/>o simplemente, "... pero si estoy poniendo mis huevos en esta cesta, ¿cómo puedo estar seguro de que todavía puedo ejecutar mi aplicación dentro de diez años?"<br/><br/>¡Todos estos son buenos puntos! Un servicio en la nube no es la solución adecuada para todos. Si queremos servir a estos usuarios, tiene que haber alguna manera de que saquen sus aplicaciones de Anvil y las ejecuten localmente, bajo su propio control completo.<br/><br/>Fuente abierta: Escotilla de escape, no un asiento eyector<br/><br/>Creemos en las escotillas de escape, no en los asientos eyectores. En las conferencias, a veces nos preguntan, "¿puedo exportar esto como una aplicación Flask + JS?". Claro, sería posible: podríamos generar un paquete de servidor, compilar el Python del lado del cliente a Javascript y escupir una aplicación web clásica. Pero tendría serios inconvenientes, porque:<br/><br/>No es un viaje cómodo.<br/><br/>La generación de código es un asiento de eyector. El código generado es mejor que nada, ¡al menos puedes editarlo! Pero en el momento en que editas ese código, pierdes todos los beneficios del sistema que lo generó. Si está utilizando Anvil debido a su editor de arrastrar y soltar y Python en el navegador, ¿por qué deberían nuestros usuarios alojados localmente tener que usar vim y Javascript?<br/><br/>Así que lo hicimos de la manera correcta: abrimos el motor de tiempo de ejecución de Anvil. Es el mismo código que sirve su aplicación en nuestro servicio alojado, y representa su aplicación de la misma manera. Puedes editar tu código con un editor de texto, ejecutarlo, luego empujarlo de nuevo a nuestro IDE en línea. No es un asiento eyector: no hay transición explosiva. Es una escotilla de escape: puedes salir y volver a entrar.<br/><br/>¿Y nuestro modelo de negocio?<br/><br/>Anvil nunca tuvo la intención de ser uno de esos sistemas empresariales de código bajo que te cobran $ 20 / mes por cada persona que usa tu aplicación. Anvil es una herramienta para desarrolladores. Las aplicaciones que desarrollas son tuyas. Habilitarlo para ejecutarlos en una Raspberry Pi es genial, pero no cambia nuestro modelo de negocio.<br/><br/>Estamos haciendo lo que siempre fuimos: creamos y vendemos una herramienta de desarrollo que simplifica drásticamente la creación de aplicaciones web. Proporcionamos alojamiento para aplicaciones Anvil. Ofrecemos toda la plataforma de desarrollo y alojamiento en el sitio para clientes empresariales. Y, por supuesto, ofrecemos un plan gratuito para que todos puedan usar Anvil con fines de hobby o educativos, o para comenzar a construir algo y ver cómo va.<br/><br/>Hemos abierto el Anvil App Server para el (relativamente pequeño) número de personas que lo necesitan, y para proporcionar la póliza de seguro definitiva. Claro, puedes crear una aplicación con Vim y alojarla tú mismo, sin siquiera registrar una cuenta con nosotros (¡tenemos documentos para mostrarte cómo!). Pero Anvil Editor es la forma más fácil del mundo de crear una aplicación web, y nuestro servicio alojado es la forma más fácil de implementarlo, por lo que esperamos que la mayoría de nuestros usuarios continúen haciéndolo. Y puede construir con confianza, sabiendo que el código de código abierto está ahí si lo necesita.<br/><br/>Pruébalo tú mismo<br/><br/>Si nuestra filosofía de desarrollo resuena con usted, ¿por qué no probar Anvil usted mismo? |
