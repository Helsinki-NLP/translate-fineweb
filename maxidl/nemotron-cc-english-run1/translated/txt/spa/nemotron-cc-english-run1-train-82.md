In simple terms, the condition is characterized by: one develops a kidney disease and undergoes a kidney transplant and other diseases associated with acidic concentration in the blood and gout. In theory, the condition will occur even if the genetic change is inherited from one parent and sporadically occurs when there is no family history.<br/><br/>Common names of autosomal dominant interstitial kidney disease<br/><br/>The condition has other names as well namely: medullary cystic kidney disease, although this name is not used as much because most people suffering from this condition do not have medullary cysts. It is also referred to as juvenile hyperuricemic nephropathy. The disease tends to affect people of ages 20 to 50. The latter condition as aforementioned occurs in young children, something, which translate to get it from both parents.<br/>Cystic kidney disease is an inherited condition whereby the cysts in the centre of each kidney gradually lose their ability to function properly. Cysts refer to abnormal blisters of fluid in the kidney. The condition further scares the kidney making unable to concentrate the urine and as a result, producing too much urine. Its symptoms include excessive urination, salt cravings, weakness, confusion, bleeding, fatigue, frequent hiccups, low blood pressure, nausea and vomiting, headaches, pale skin, reduced sensation in the hands, weight loss among many others. Other complications include: anemia, ulcers, loss of bone density, infertility and other heart related problems.<br/>Its analysis incorporates blood tests to check for sodium levels and general kidney functions, urine tests to check the levels of concentration and other imbalances, x rays to check for the size of kidneys that may be altered owing to increased urine concentrations, renal biopsy and genetic testing to verify any genetic changes that might have taken place in due time.<br/>While the disease does not have a cut and dry treatment to it, one may focus on controlling measures, which include intake of fluids and salt to supplement the one lost as the disease progresses into latter stages. This also helps reduce dehydration. Other treatments include taking of prescribed medication and diet changes and minimal intakes of foods containing phosphorous and potassium. Further complications may also require one to have a kidney transplant. Basically, this is not a curable disease but rather a manageable once detected in the early stages.<br/><br/>The common yet different factor of Autosomal dominant interstitial kidney disease<br/><br/>Nephronophthisis and medullary cystic kidney disease are mainly grouped together because, in essence, they share the same features but with a slight difference in regards inheritance patterns to the former affecting children and the latter affecting young adults and older age groups. Similar features for both are ADH resistant urine concentration that leads to polyuria and polydipsia, anemia and renal diseases.<br/>The former aforementioned condition is Autosomal recessive accounting to 15% of chronic diseases and causes ESRD during early childhood while the latter is Autosomal dominant with a few sporadic new mutations and causes ESRD for people between the ages of 30 and 50. | Certificación de RCP en línea Blog<br/><br/>Fecha: 23 de julio de 2014<br/><br/>La enfermedad renal intersticial autosómica dominante es una colección rara de enfermedades que afectan las funciones conocidas del riñón. En términos simples, la condición se caracteriza por: uno desarrolla una enfermedad renal y se somete a un trasplante de riñón y otras enfermedades asociadas con la concentración ácida en la sangre y la gota. En teoría, la condición ocurrirá incluso si el cambio genético se hereda de uno de los padres y ocurre esporádicamente cuando no hay antecedentes familiares.<br/><br/>Nombres comunes de la enfermedad renal intersticial autosómica dominante<br/><br/>La condición también tiene otros nombres: enfermedad renal quística medular, aunque este nombre no se usa tanto porque la mayoría de las personas que padecen esta condición no tienen quistes medulares. También se le conoce como nefropatía hiperuricémica juvenil. La enfermedad tiende a afectar a personas de 20 a 50 años. Esta última condición, como se mencionó anteriormente, ocurre en niños pequeños, algo que se traduce en que ambos padres la contraen.<br/>La enfermedad renal quística es una condición hereditaria por la cual los quistes en el centro de cada riñón pierden gradualmente su capacidad para funcionar correctamente.Los quistes se refieren a ampollas anormales de líquido en el riñón. La condición asusta aún más al riñón al no poder concentrar la orina y, como resultado, producir demasiada orina. Sus síntomas incluyen micción excesiva, antojos de sal, debilidad, confusión, sangrado, fatiga, hipo frecuente, presión arterial baja, náuseas y vómitos, dolores de cabeza, piel pálida, sensación reducida en las manos, pérdida de peso entre muchos otros. Otras complicaciones incluyen: anemia, úlceras, pérdida de densidad ósea, infertilidad y otros problemas relacionados con el corazón.<br/>Su análisis incorpora análisis de sangre para verificar los niveles de sodio y las funciones generales de los riñones, análisis de orina para verificar los niveles de concentración y otros desequilibrios, rayos X para verificar el tamaño de los riñones que pueden alterarse debido al aumento de las concentraciones de orina, biopsia renal y pruebas genéticas para verificar cualquier cambio genético que pueda haber tenido lugar a su debido tiempo.<br/>Si bien la enfermedad no tiene un tratamiento de corte y secado, uno puede enfocarse en medidas de control, que incluyen la ingesta de líquidos y sal para complementar la perdida a medida que la enfermedad progresa en las últimas etapas, lo que también ayuda a reducir la deshidratación. Otros tratamientos incluyen tomar medicamentos recetados y cambios en la dieta y una ingesta mínima de alimentos que contienen fósforo y potasio. Otras complicaciones también pueden requerir que uno tenga un trasplante de riñón. Básicamente, esta no es una enfermedad curable, sino más bien una enfermedad manejable una vez detectada en las primeras etapas.<br/><br/>El factor común pero diferente de la enfermedad renal intersticial autosómica dominante<br/><br/>La nefronoftisis y la enfermedad renal quística medular se agrupan principalmente porque, en esencia, comparten las mismas características pero con una ligera diferencia en cuanto a los patrones de herencia con respecto a los primeros que afectan a los niños y los últimos que afectan a los adultos jóvenes y a los grupos de mayor edad. Características similares para ambos son la concentración de orina resistente a ADH que conduce a poliuria y polidipsia, anemia y enfermedades renales.<br/>La primera condición mencionada anteriormente es autosómica recesiva que representa el 15% de las enfermedades crónicas y causa ESRD durante la primera infancia, mientras que la segunda es autosómica dominante con algunas mutaciones nuevas esporádicas y causa ESRD para personas entre las edades de 30 y 50. |
| Hobbes' vs. Locke's Account on the State of Nature<br/><br/>Topic: PhilosophyWords: 2539Pages: 9Aug 3rd, 2021<br/><br/>Hobbes and Locke are among the most influential political philosophers to ever write in English. The state of nature, which precedes the organization of the complex societies, is the common premise that both Hobbes and Locke share but interpret in different ways. The former views humans in their natural state as equally dangerous and free to pursue their egoistic goals unrestricted by the nonexistent notions of justice, which is why his natural state amounts to the "war of every man against every man" (Hobbes76). The latter, on the other hand, views humans in their original condition as equally valuable and restricts natural freedom by the idea of justice that requires not to harm others, which allows defining the state of nature as "mutual assistance and preservation" rather than war (Locke 15). The key difference between the two philosophers' accounts of natural state is that Locke uses ethical considerations while Hobbes does not, and it ultimately leads Hobbes to envisage a state exercising unlimited power over human beings, while Locke limits the government by the moral principles, which he considers a natural law.<br/><br/>Hobbes bases his assumptions regarding the state of nature on the fact that all people are roughly equal in their physical and mental capabilities. He admits that some individuals may demonstrate greater physical strength or superior intellect but insists that "when all is reckoned together, the difference between man and man is not so considerable" (Hobbes 74). Since humans are roughly equal in their capabilities, they also have similar hopes to attain their ends and satisfy their needs (Hobbes 75). As a logical outcome of this equality, when the people begin competing for scarce resources, no one may feel entirely secure in his or her possessions. Even if a mighty, cunning, and capable person succeeds in subjugating "the persons of all men he can," it still does not guarantee the ultimate security (Hobbes 75). As no human can obtain such superiority over the others that renders him or her utterly immune to their strength of intellect, no human can feel completely safe when surrounded by his or her equals. Hobbes' equality in the natural state is equality of fear, where all humans view each other as dangerous competitors.<br/><br/>Just as Hobbes, Locke considers all human beings to be fundamentally equal, but assigns a very different meaning to the term. From his perspective, it is not the equality of capabilities, but, rather, the equality of value. He opines that the people "promiscuously born to all the same advantages of nature" should logically enjoy the perfect equality among them, as there is no reason to consider anyone inherently more valuable (Locke 8). The only possible foundation for designating some people as superior to others would be if God "by any manifest declaration of his will, set one above another" (Locke 8). Since such divine sanction of superiority is absent, Locke concludes that the natural equality of all representatives of humankind is not to be called into question. Hobbes approaches equality pragmatically and stresses that people in their natural state are equally dangerous, but Locke employs an ethical approach and emphasizes that humans are equally valuable in God's eyes. This disagreement is but the first difference between the two authors based on the fact that Locke includes God as a premise into his political philosophy, while Hobbes does not.<br/><br/>Another characteristic feature of Hobbes' account of the natural state is his interpretation of liberty. According to Hobbes, the state of nature implies unlimited freedom to do whatever is necessary for one's continued existence. The philosopher defines liberty as "the absence of external impediments" in using one's abilities to attain one's goals (Hobbes 79). The primary purpose of every sentient being is to maintain its continued existence. As a consequence, Hobbesian freedom amounts to the unhindered opportunity to do anything that, in one's judgment, would be best suited to preserve one's life and possessions (Hobbes 79). The only limitation to liberty is that a person cannot do anything contradictory to sustaining his or her life or destroying "the means of preserving the same" (Hobbes 79). Apart from that, there are no boundaries, and everyone has "a right to everything, even to one another's body" if that furthers one's survival (Hobbes 80). Thus, natural liberty, as viewed by Hobbes, is the absence of externally enforced obstacles in pursuing one's right to everything to sustain and secure one's continued existence.<br/><br/>Locke also upholds the idea of natural liberty but, unsurprisingly, approaches it in a manner that is significantly different from that of Hobbes. As soon as he begins discussing liberty in the state of nature, he immediately notes that a state of freedom does not equate "a state of license" (Locke 9). The philosopher identifies two specific limitations to human freedom in the state of nature. The first one is identical to that introduce by Hobbes: however free and independent, a person nevertheless "has not liberty to destroy himself" (Locke 9). Yet the second limitation contradicts Hobbes' prepositions directly. According to Locke, every human being has a natural obligation not to "harm another in his life, health, liberty, or possessions" (9). Just as with his interpretation of equality, the author bases this assertion on ethical and religious grounds: people should preserve each other's existence since they are all creations of the same "omnipotent, and infinitely wise maker" (Locke 9). Thus, Locke's limits liberty in the natural state far more stringently than Hobbes by introducing the obligation to refrain from harming both oneself and the others.<br/><br/>The differences between the two authors also manifest in their accounts of justice in the natural state of humanity. As far as Hobbes is concerned, delineating just and unjust practices is merely the matter of the law. There is no jurisprudence in the state of nature, and the only law governing human beings in their original condition is a natural law that only obliges them to seek personal security. As a result, nothing can be unjust in the original state of the humankind: "notions of right and wrong justice and injustice" have no place and no meaning in the absence of the stringently enforced law (Hobbes 78). As long as the people use their virtually unlimited freedom to ruthlessly compete with each other for resources, to which they are equally entitled, they have no criteria to differentiate between just and unjust actions. Therefore, the Hobbesian state of nature defies the very idea of justice since the author interprets it as a mere function of the formalized and established law.<br/><br/>Locke assigns different meaning to justice and views it not so much in legislative as in the ethical terms. This paper already mentioned that, unlike Hobbes, Locke employs ethical notions and generally bases his political philosophy on moral rather than purely practical presumptions. Locke's natural law, unlike that of Hobbes, obliges human beings to take care of each other rather than simply leaving everyone to fend for themselves. As a result, there is a place for justice and injustice in his state of nature. The author points to this fact himself when noting that no one should deprive another of his or her life of the means of preserving it "unless it be to do justice on an offender" (Locke 9). This statement reveals with the utmost clarity that, according to Locke, there is justice in the state of nature, and, moreover, humans have to preserve it actively. The criterion of justice, which Hobbes' natural state lacks, is the second limitation on natural liberty imposed by Locke: an action is unjust if it constitutes an unwarranted threat to another person's life and possessions.<br/><br/>These differences in the two authors' treatment of equality, liberty, and justice or injustice culminate in their interpretation of the relationship between the state of nature and the state of war. From Hobbes's perspective, the two are synonymous, because the ruthless competition is the only logical outcome of putting people with equivalent capabilities and similar needs in an environment with limited resources. He states this connection outright: "if any two men desire the same thing, which nevertheless they cannot both enjoy, they become enemies" and are, therefore, in the state of war with each other (Hobbes 75). Yet since humans are numerous and all possess similar capabilities and needs, this competition manifests not only in the individual interactions but also on the level of humanity as a whole. As long as all humans have equal and unlimited rights to all resources and even to each other's bodies and lives, the state of nature is a war of "every man against every man" (Hobbes 76). This grim interpretation stems directly from Hobbes' portrayal of the state of nature as governed solely by the individuals' egoistic urges.<br/><br/>Locke, on the other hand, differentiates between the state of nature and the state of war and points out that, while they may occur simultaneously, it is no reason to identify one with the other. Locke's definition of the state of war is virtually identical to that offered by Hobbes. According to Locke, "he who attempts to get another man into his absolute power does thereby put himself into a state of war with him" (14). This explanation lines up perfectly with the Hobbesian notion that everyone's universal right to everything, including the other people's bodies and lives, leads to the state of war. Yet Locke refuses to equate the state of war and the state of nature precisely because he denies Hobbes' interpretation of natural freedom. Since Locke's natural state restrains people from harming each other through the second limitation of liberty, an attempt on another person's freedom is a transgression against the natural law. While for Hobbes, war is the humankind's condition by default, Locke portrays it as a perversion of the state of nature rather than its rule.<br/><br/>These differences in delineating the state on nature and its constituents, such as liberty, equality, justice, and war, pave the way to the authors contrasting portrayals of government. Based on his pessimistic assessment of the state of nature, the author of Leviathan concludes that, under conditions of war, there can be no definite hope for "living out the time which nature ordinarily alloweth men to live" (Hobbes 80). The solution is laying down the universal right to everything and leaving everyone "so much liberty against other men, as he would allow other men against himself" (Hobbes 80). The participants of the resulting social contract invest the unlimited liberties they have surrendered into a sovereign – the bearer of the supreme power whose purpose is to preserve the achieved status quo by punishing all transgressions against it. Sovereign's power is absolute: the ruler has the authority "to do whatsoever he shall think necessary" to promote peace between his subjects so that no one would assail another's life or property (113). Hobbes concludes that without such an unassailable figure entitled with the right to do anything to the subjects, there can be no peace and no guarantee of security.<br/><br/>While Locke agrees with the necessity of creating politically organized societies, he nevertheless opposes Hobbes' idea of the sovereign power as unlimited and unassailable. As mentioned above, Locke's state of nature is not nearly as dreadful as that painted by Hobbes because of the people's obligation to preserve not only themselves but each other as well. Therefore, the need for social contract arises not from the fear of the others, but from the sheer convenience. Small communities may not need numerous laws to solve conflicts and "officers to superintend the process," but larger associations find it advisable to institute governments for that purpose (Locke 57). Yet the power of the government cannot be unlimited because it would result in subduing the subjects to an "inconstant, uncertain, unknown, arbitrary will of another man" (Locke 17). Such a government would constitute a twofold violation of the natural law. By agreeing to another person's absolute power over his life, a subject would violate its first limitation prohibiting to harm oneself. As for the ruler, destroying another person's liberty would constitute direct harm and, as such, be contradictory to the second limitation.<br/><br/>As a direct continuation of his case for unlimited governmental authority, Hobbes denies the separation of powers as a principle. From his perspective, the sovereign, once instituted, possesses "the whole power of prescribing the rules" governing the lives of the subjects or, in shorter terms, the legislative power (Hobbes 114). The sovereign also reserves the right of "hearing and deciding all controversies" – that is, the judicial power (Hobbes 114). Finally, since the entire purpose of the sovereign is to force the subjects to refrain from harming each other, there can be no doubt that executive power is also his or her exclusive prerogative. The separation of powers as a concept is alien to Hobbes because of his views on the state of nature. Creating a political entity where the executive, legislative, and judicial branches would check each other – that is, compete – would mean recreating the Hobbesian state of nature-as-war on a higher level. Since the people enter a social contract and institute a government to put the state of nature behind them, not reinstate it in a different form, the separation of powers contradictory Hobbes' views directly.<br/><br/>Locke, on the other hand, embraces separation of power as a foundational principle of his political theory. His case for the separation is evident in the discussion of the limits of the legislative power. As Locke puts it, it would be hardly advisable "for the same persons, who have the power of making laws, to have also in their hands the power to execute them" (76). The philosopher points to the imperfections of human nature and the inherent desire to "grasp at power" as a rationale for this precautionary measure (Locke 76). Just as in Hobbes' case, Locke's account of the separation of powers stems directly from his interpretation of the state of nature. If there is already justice in the state of nature and the people can understand it, any government is inevitably subject to the same natural law. Since absolute power over people violates both limitations of this law, separating and distributing it is advisable so that the government would function appropriately.<br/><br/>This paper has demonstrated that, while the differences between Hobbes' and Locke's accounts of the natural state of humanity are numerous, they ultimately amount to the presence of absence of moral premises. Hobbes views the natural state as that of unlimited liberty, where people endowed with equal capabilities and not bound by any moral notions, such as justice, compete for the resources unceasingly. Locke, however, interprets equality and liberty ethically rather than practically and opines that war is a perversion of the natural state, as the natural law obliges humans not to harm each other. This disagreement influences the philosophers' approaches to government. Hobbes insists on an all-powerful ruler, as, in the absence of ethical restraints, no other authority could force the humans to refrain from harming each other. Yet, in Locke's view, granting the government unlimited powers would be contradictory to the ethical limitations embedded in the law of nature, which is why he, unlike Hobbes, advocates separation of powers. | La cuenta de Hobbes vs. Locke sobre el estado de la naturaleza<br/><br/>Tema: FilosofíaPalabras: 2539Páginas: 9Aug 3rd, 2021<br/><br/>Hobbes y Locke se encuentran entre los filósofos políticos más influyentes que jamás hayan escrito en inglés. El estado de naturaleza, que precede a la organización de las sociedades complejas, es la premisa común que tanto Hobbes como Locke comparten pero interpretan de diferentes maneras. El primero ve a los humanos en su estado natural como igualmente peligrosos y libres para perseguir sus objetivos egoístas sin restricciones por las nociones inexistentes de justicia, por lo que su estado natural equivale a la "guerra de cada hombre contra cada hombre" (Hobbes 76). Este último, por otro lado, ve a los humanos en su condición original como igualmente valiosos y restringe la libertad natural por la idea de justicia que requiere no dañar a otros, lo que permite definir el estado de la naturaleza como "ayuda mutua y preservación" en lugar de guerra (Locke 15). La diferencia clave entre los relatos de los dos filósofos sobre el estado natural es que Locke utiliza consideraciones éticas, mientras que Hobbes no lo hace, y en última instancia lleva a Hobbes a imaginar un estado que ejerce un poder ilimitado sobre los seres humanos, mientras que Locke limita el gobierno por los principios morales, que él considera una ley natural.<br/><br/>Hobbes basa sus suposiciones con respecto al estado de la naturaleza en el hecho de que todas las personas son aproximadamente iguales en sus capacidades físicas y mentales. Admite que algunos individuos pueden demostrar una mayor fuerza física o intelecto superior, pero insiste en que "cuando todo se cuenta, la diferencia entre el hombre y el hombre no es tan considerable" (Hobbes 74). Dado que los humanos son más o menos iguales en sus capacidades, también tienen esperanzas similares de alcanzar sus fines y satisfacer sus necesidades (Hobbes 75). Como resultado lógico de esta igualdad, cuando las personas comienzan a competir por los recursos escasos, nadie puede sentirse completamente seguro en sus posesiones. Incluso si una persona poderosa, astuta y capaz logra subyugar "a las personas de todos los hombres que puede", todavía no garantiza la máxima seguridad (Hobbes 75). Como ningún humano puede obtener tal superioridad sobre los demás que lo haga completamente inmune a su fuerza de intelecto, ningún humano puede sentirse completamente seguro cuando está rodeado por sus iguales. La igualdad de Hobbes en el estado natural es la igualdad del miedo, donde todos los humanos se ven unos a otros como competidores peligrosos.<br/><br/>Al igual que Hobbes, Locke considera que todos los seres humanos son fundamentalmente iguales, pero asigna un significado muy diferente al término. Desde su perspectiva, no es la igualdad de capacidades, sino, más bien, la igualdad de valor. Él opina que las personas "promiscuamente nacidas de las mismas ventajas de la naturaleza" deberían lógicamente disfrutar de la igualdad perfecta entre ellos, ya que no hay razón para considerar a nadie intrínsecamente más valioso (Locke 8). El único fundamento posible para designar a algunas personas como superiores a otras sería si Dios "por cualquier declaración manifiesta de su voluntad, se pusiera unos sobre otros" (Locke 8). Dado que tal sanción divina de superioridad está ausente, Locke concluye que la igualdad natural de todos los representantes de la humanidad no debe ser cuestionada. Hobbes aborda la igualdad pragmáticamente y enfatiza que las personas en su estado natural son igualmente peligrosas, pero Locke emplea un enfoque ético y enfatiza que los humanos son igualmente valiosos a los ojos de Dios. Este desacuerdo no es más que la primera diferencia entre los dos autores basada en el hecho de que Locke incluye a Dios como una premisa en su filosofía política, mientras que Hobbes no lo hace.<br/><br/>Otro rasgo característico del relato de Hobbes sobre el estado natural es su interpretación de la libertad. Según Hobbes, el estado de naturaleza implica libertad ilimitada para hacer lo que sea necesario para la existencia continua de uno. El filósofo define la libertad como "la ausencia de impedimentos externos" en el uso de las habilidades de uno para alcanzar los objetivos de uno (Hobbes 79). El propósito principal de cada ser sintiente es mantener su existencia continua. Como consecuencia, la libertad hobbesiana equivale a la oportunidad sin obstáculos de hacer cualquier cosa que, a juicio de uno, sería la más adecuada para preservar la vida y las posesiones de uno (Hobbes 79). La única limitación a la libertad es que una persona no puede hacer nada contradictorio para sostener su vida o destruir "los medios de preservar la misma" (Hobbes 79). Aparte de eso, no hay límites, y todos tienen "derecho a todo, incluso al cuerpo del otro" si eso promueve la supervivencia de uno (Hobbes 80). Por lo tanto, la libertad natural, como lo ve Hobbes, es la ausencia de obstáculos forzados externamente en la búsqueda del derecho de uno a todo para sostener y asegurar la existencia continua de uno.<br/><br/>Locke también defiende la idea de la libertad natural, pero, como era de esperar, se acerca a ella de una manera que es significativamente diferente de la de Hobbes. Tan pronto como comienza a discutir la libertad en el estado de naturaleza, inmediatamente señala que un estado de libertad no equivale a "un estado de licencia" (Locke 9).El filósofo identifica dos limitaciones específicas a la libertad humana en el estado de naturaleza. La primera es idéntica a la introducida por Hobbes: por libre e independiente que sea, una persona "no tiene libertad para destruirse a sí misma" (Locke 9). Según Locke, todo ser humano tiene la obligación natural de no "dañar a otro en su vida, salud, libertad o posesiones" (9). Al igual que con su interpretación de la igualdad, el autor basa esta afirmación en motivos éticos y religiosos: las personas deben preservar la existencia de los demás, ya que todas son creaciones del mismo "creador omnipotente e infinitamente sabio" (Locke 9). Por lo tanto, los límites de Locke libertad en el estado natural mucho más rigurosamente que Hobbes mediante la introducción de la obligación de abstenerse de dañar a uno mismo y los demás.<br/><br/>Las diferencias entre los dos autores también se manifiestan en sus relatos de la justicia en el estado natural de la humanidad. En lo que respecta a Hobbes, delinear prácticas justas e injustas es simplemente una cuestión de la ley. No hay jurisprudencia en el estado de naturaleza, y la única ley que rige a los seres humanos en su condición original es una ley natural que solo los obliga a buscar seguridad personal. Como resultado, nada puede ser injusto en el estado original de la humanidad: "las nociones de justicia e injusticia correctas e incorrectas" no tienen lugar ni sentido en ausencia de la ley estrictamente impuesta (Hobbes 78). Mientras las personas usen su libertad virtualmente ilimitada para competir despiadadamente entre sí por los recursos, a los que tienen el mismo derecho, no tienen criterios para diferenciar entre acciones justas e injustas. Por lo tanto, el estado hobbesiano de la naturaleza desafía la idea misma de la justicia, ya que el autor la interpreta como una mera función de la ley formalizada y establecida.<br/><br/>Locke asigna un significado diferente a la justicia y la ve no tanto en términos legislativos como en términos éticos. Este artículo ya mencionaba que, a diferencia de Hobbes, Locke emplea nociones éticas y generalmente basa su filosofía política en presunciones morales más que puramente prácticas. La ley natural de Locke, a diferencia de la de Hobbes, obliga a los seres humanos a cuidarse unos a otros en lugar de simplemente dejar que todos se valgan por sí mismos. Como resultado, hay un lugar para la justicia y la injusticia en su estado de naturaleza. El propio autor señala este hecho cuando señala que nadie debe privar a otro de su vida de los medios para preservarla "a menos que sea para hacer justicia a un delincuente" (Locke 9). Esta declaración revela con la mayor claridad que, según Locke, hay justicia en el estado de la naturaleza, y, además, los humanos tienen que preservarla activamente. El criterio de justicia, del que carece el estado natural de Hobbes, es la segunda limitación a la libertad natural impuesta por Locke: una acción es injusta si constituye una amenaza injustificada a la vida y posesiones de otra persona.<br/><br/>Estas diferencias en el tratamiento de los dos autores de la igualdad, la libertad y la justicia o injusticia culminan en su interpretación de la relación entre el estado de naturaleza y el estado de guerra. Desde la perspectiva de Hobbes, los dos son sinónimos, porque la competencia despiadada es el único resultado lógico de poner a las personas con capacidades equivalentes y necesidades similares en un entorno con recursos limitados. Afirma esta conexión directamente: "si dos hombres cualesquiera desean la misma cosa, que sin embargo no pueden disfrutar ambos, se hacen enemigos" y están, por lo tanto, en el estado de guerra el uno con el otro (Hobbes 75). Sin embargo, dado que los humanos son numerosos y todos poseen capacidades y necesidades similares, esta competencia se manifiesta no solo en las interacciones individuales sino también en el nivel de la humanidad en su conjunto. Mientras todos los humanos tengan derechos iguales e ilimitados sobre todos los recursos e incluso sobre los cuerpos y vidas de los demás, el estado de la naturaleza es una guerra de "cada hombre contra cada hombre" (Hobbes 76). Esta interpretación sombría se deriva directamente de la representación de Hobbes del estado de la naturaleza como gobernado únicamente por los impulsos egoístas de los individuos.<br/><br/>Locke, por otro lado, diferencia entre el estado de naturaleza y el estado de guerra y señala que, si bien pueden ocurrir simultáneamente, no es razón para identificar uno con el otro. La definición de Locke del estado de guerra es prácticamente idéntica a la ofrecida por Hobbes: "el que intenta poner a otro hombre en su poder absoluto se pone en un estado de guerra con él" (14). Esta explicación se alinea perfectamente con la noción hobbesiana de que el derecho universal de todos a todo, incluidos los cuerpos y las vidas de las otras personas, conduce al estado de guerra. Sin embargo, Locke se niega a equiparar el estado de guerra y el estado de naturaleza precisamente porque niega la interpretación de Hobbes de la libertad natural. Dado que el estado natural de Locke impide que las personas se dañen entre sí a través de la segunda limitación de la libertad, un atentado contra la libertad de otra persona es una transgresión contra la ley natural. Mientras que para Hobbes, la guerra es la condición de la humanidad por defecto, Locke la retrata como una perversión del estado de la naturaleza en lugar de su regla.<br/><br/>Estas diferencias en la delineación del estado sobre la naturaleza y sus constituyentes, como la libertad, la igualdad, la justicia y la guerra, allanan el camino para que los autores contrasten las representaciones del gobierno. Sobre la base de su evaluación pesimista del estado de la naturaleza, el autor de Leviatán concluye que, en condiciones de guerra, no puede haber una esperanza definitiva de "vivir el tiempo que la naturaleza ordinariamente permite que los hombres vivan" (Hobbes 80). La solución es establecer el derecho universal a todo y dejar a todos "tanta libertad contra otros hombres, como él permitiría a otros hombres contra sí mismo" (Hobbes 80). Los participantes del contrato social resultante invierten las libertades ilimitadas que han entregado en un soberano, el portador del poder supremo cuyo propósito es preservar el status quo logrado castigando todas las transgresiones contra él. El poder del soberano es absoluto: el gobernante tiene la autoridad "para hacer lo que considere necesario" para promover la paz entre sus súbditos para que nadie asalte la vida o la propiedad de otro. Hobbes concluye que sin una figura tan inexpugnable con derecho a hacer cualquier cosa a los súbditos, no puede haber paz ni garantía de seguridad.<br/><br/>Mientras Locke está de acuerdo con la necesidad de crear sociedades políticamente organizadas, sin embargo se opone a la idea de Hobbes del poder soberano como ilimitado e inexpugnable. Como se mencionó anteriormente, el estado de naturaleza de Locke no es tan terrible como el pintado por Hobbes debido a la obligación del pueblo de preservar no solo a sí mismos, sino también a los demás. Por lo tanto, la necesidad de un contrato social no surge del miedo a los demás, sino de la mera conveniencia. Es posible que las comunidades pequeñas no necesiten numerosas leyes para resolver conflictos y "oficiales para supervisar el proceso", pero las asociaciones más grandes consideran aconsejable instituir gobiernos para ese propósito (Locke 57). Sin embargo, el poder del gobierno no puede ser ilimitado, ya que resultaría en someter a los súbditos a una “voluntad inconstante, incierta, desconocida y arbitraria de otro hombre” (Locke 17). Al aceptar el poder absoluto de otra persona sobre su vida, un sujeto violaría su primera limitación que prohíbe hacerse daño a sí mismo. En cuanto al gobernante, destruir la libertad de otra persona constituiría un daño directo y, como tal, sería contradictorio con la segunda limitación.<br/><br/>Como una continuación directa de su caso para la autoridad gubernamental ilimitada, Hobbes niega la separación de poderes como un principio. Desde su perspectiva, el soberano, una vez instituido, posee "todo el poder de prescribir las reglas" que rigen la vida de los súbditos o, en términos más cortos, el poder legislativo (Hobbes 114). El soberano también se reserva el derecho de "escuchar y decidir todas las controversias", es decir, el poder judicial (Hobbes 114). Por último, dado que el propósito del soberano es obligar a los súbditos a abstenerse de dañarse unos a otros, no puede haber duda de que el poder ejecutivo es también su prerrogativa exclusiva. La separación de poderes como concepto es ajena a Hobbes debido a sus puntos de vista sobre el estado de la naturaleza. Crear una entidad política donde los poderes ejecutivo, legislativo y judicial se controlen entre sí, es decir, compitan, significaría recrear el estado hobbesiano de naturaleza como guerra en un nivel superior. Puesto que la gente entra en un contrato social e instituye un gobierno para poner el estado de naturaleza detrás de ellos, no restablecerlo en una forma diferente, la separación de poderes contradice directamente las opiniones de Hobbes.<br/><br/>Locke, por otro lado, abraza la separación del poder como un principio fundamental de su teoría política. Su argumento a favor de la separación es evidente en la discusión de los límites del poder legislativo. Como dice Locke, difícilmente sería aconsejable "que las mismas personas, que tienen el poder de hacer leyes, tengan también en sus manos el poder de ejecutarlas" (76). El filósofo señala las imperfecciones de la naturaleza humana y el deseo inherente de "agarrar el poder" como una justificación para esta medida de precaución (Locke 76). Al igual que en el caso de Hobbes, el relato de Locke sobre la separación de poderes se deriva directamente de su interpretación del estado de la naturaleza. Si ya hay justicia en el estado de naturaleza y el pueblo puede entenderla, cualquier gobierno está inevitablemente sujeto a la misma ley natural. Dado que el poder absoluto sobre las personas viola ambas limitaciones de esta ley, es aconsejable separarla y distribuirla para que el gobierno funcione adecuadamente.<br/><br/>Este documento ha demostrado que, si bien las diferencias entre los relatos de Hobbes y Locke sobre el estado natural de la humanidad son numerosas, en última instancia equivalen a la presencia de la ausencia de premisas morales. Hobbes ve el estado natural como el de la libertad ilimitada, donde las personas dotadas de las mismas capacidades y no atadas por ninguna noción moral, como la justicia, compiten por los recursos incesantemente. Locke, sin embargo, interpreta la igualdad y la libertad éticamente en lugar de prácticamente y opina que la guerra es una perversión del estado natural, ya que la ley natural obliga a los humanos a no dañarse entre sí. Hobbes insiste en un gobernante todopoderoso, ya que, en ausencia de restricciones éticas, ninguna otra autoridad podría obligar a los humanos a abstenerse de hacerse daño unos a otros. Sin embargo, en opinión de Locke, otorgar poderes ilimitados al gobierno sería contradictorio con las limitaciones éticas incrustadas en la ley de la naturaleza, por lo que él, a diferencia de Hobbes, aboga por la separación de poderes. |
| Fashion Police: What Game of Thrones threw up<br/><br/>Canadian-French singer Abbas Hasan put blinding effort to outshine all of humanity at Fashion Parade 2014. Nothing wrong with that, except safety is priority and the musician is a health hazard here.<br/><br/>We get he wants to be a star. Sadly, he didn't get the memo where they tell the desperate and the infamous that stardom is a metaphor. You don't have to look like one and literally set our sight ablaze. Also, the All Pakistan Aunty Association has officially lodged a complaint against him. The local market has run dry of fake crystals and sequined monstrosities. They have nothing to wear to their biweekly high teas and they claim he is to blame. Apparently, the outfit is inspired by Game of Thrones. Can he please stick to composing sad songs about his neighbour's dead dog instead of conceptualising outfits? Or maybe it's the trauma of losing the dog, whose death he is clearly not over as he is still wearing its carcass.<br/><br/>The charge sheet Outfit<br/><br/>No one can decide where the outfit begins and where Abbas ends. You stare in fascination, sinking into a deep abyss and wonder why he is wearing leather pants. Whose horse did he kill to steal the saddle draped across his shoulders? Was he in prison right before his red carpet appearance and forgot to take off the chains? How will he survive the synthetic leather and post-sequin rash that is bound to be lethal in such high dosage? Why am I still alive?<br/><br/>Idea<br/><br/>His inspiration was seemingly Game of Thrones, but he eventually ended up looking like he was thrown out of a Viking restaurant. Had he come across any of the characters from the show, he would've been slain in the first five seconds of the first episode.<br/><br/>The mental health or lack thereof: Someone get him to a counsellor ASAP! He seems to be under the assumption that wearing a dead dog means that the only friend he had in his life is still alive. Dear Abbas:<br/><br/>1. Denial is not a river in Egypt<br/><br/>2. Your tortured psyche is not helping your music, so get help<br/><br/>3. Try imaginary friends<br/><br/>Bail out!<br/><br/>All of us at the Fashion Police headquarters are severely traumatised. Abbas is someone we did not enjoy arresting. He is currently in custody and attempting revenge by putting on attires from other fantasy shows. He just glitter glued himself in order to look like Edward Cullen from Twilight. As a public service message and to prevent further nervous breakdowns, we gave him the following examples of men from the red carpet of the same event.<br/><br/>Zohaib Hassan<br/><br/>When in doubt, play it safe. The singer looks like your average uncle at a shaadi. A plain black suit with no accessories, even if it's a tad disproportionate, is workable. Zohaib's look is blended into everything and nothing, and when you don't have a fashion sense or the money to hire a stylist, this is okay. It does not carry the risk of cardiac arrest for fellow attendees at an event. Given Abbas' delicate mental condition, this look is what he should aim for. Always and forever.<br/><br/>Ali Zafar<br/><br/>One day, after decades of therapy, Abbas could aspire to wear attire like Ali Zafar's. The dapper summer look is done to near perfection. Ali came really close to looking like a maître d at a French restaurant with his white summer jacket with black lapels, but the shirt saves it, never mind the satin. His pants would have been ridiculous had they not been folded at the ankles. The shoes are what hipster chic happy endings are made of. | Fashion Police: Lo que tiró Juego de Tronos<br/><br/>El cantante canadiense-francés Abbas Hasan hizo un esfuerzo cegador para eclipsar a toda la humanidad en Fashion Parade 2014. Nada de malo en eso, excepto que la seguridad es prioridad y el músico es un peligro para la salud aquí.<br/><br/>Entendemos que quiere ser una estrella. Tristemente, no recibió el memorándum donde le dicen a los desesperados e infames que el estrellato es una metáfora. No tienes que parecerte a uno y literalmente prender fuego a nuestra vista. Además, la Asociación de Todas las Tías de Pakistán ha presentado oficialmente una queja en su contra. El mercado local se ha secado de cristales falsos y monstruosidades con lentejuelas. No tienen nada que usar para sus tés altos quincenales y afirman que él es el culpable. Aparentemente, el atuendo está inspirado en Juego de Tronos. ¿Puede por favor atenerse a componer canciones tristes sobre el perro muerto de su vecino en lugar de conceptualizar los atuendos? O tal vez es el trauma de perder al perro, cuya muerte claramente no ha terminado ya que todavía está usando su cadáver.<br/><br/>La hoja de cargos Outfit<br/><br/>Nadie puede decidir dónde comienza el equipo y dónde termina Abbas. Usted mira fijamente en la fascinación, hundiéndose en un abismo profundo y se pregunta por qué lleva pantalones de cuero. ¿De quién caballo mató para robar la silla de montar colgada sobre sus hombros? ¿Estaba en prisión justo antes de su aparición en la alfombra roja y se olvidó de quitarse las cadenas? ¿Cómo sobrevivirá a la erupción de cuero sintético y post-sequin que seguramente será letal en una dosis tan alta? ¿Por qué todavía estoy vivo?<br/><br/>Idea<br/><br/>Su inspiración aparentemente era Juego de Tronos, pero finalmente terminó pareciendo que fue expulsado de un restaurante vikingo. Si se hubiera encontrado con alguno de los personajes del programa, habría sido asesinado en los primeros cinco segundos del primer episodio.<br/><br/>La salud mental o la falta de ella: Alguien que lo lleve a un consejero lo antes posible! Parece estar bajo la suposición de que el uso de un perro muerto significa que el único amigo que tenía en su vida todavía está vivo.<br/><br/>La negación no es un río en Egipto<br/><br/>2. Tu psique torturada no está ayudando a tu música, así que busca ayuda<br/><br/>3. Prueba amigos imaginarios<br/><br/>¡Salve!<br/><br/>Todos nosotros en la sede de Fashion Police estamos gravemente traumatizados. Abbas es alguien a quien no disfrutamos arrestar. Actualmente está bajo custodia e intenta vengarse vistiendo atuendos de otros programas de fantasía. Como mensaje de servicio público y para evitar más crisis nerviosas, le dimos los siguientes ejemplos de hombres de la alfombra roja del mismo evento.<br/><br/>Zohaib Hassan<br/><br/>En caso de duda, ponte a salvo. El cantante se parece a tu tío promedio en un shaadi. Un traje negro liso sin accesorios, incluso si es un poco desproporcionado, es viable. El aspecto de Zohaib se mezcla con todo y nada, y cuando no tienes un sentido de la moda o el dinero para contratar a un estilista, esto está bien. No conlleva el riesgo de paro cardíaco para los compañeros asistentes a un evento. Dada la delicada condición mental de Abbas, esta mirada es lo que debe aspirar. Siempre y para siempre.<br/><br/>Ali Zafar<br/><br/>Un día, después de décadas de terapia, Abbas podría aspirar a vestirse como el traje de Ali Zafar. Ali estuvo a punto de parecer un maestro en un restaurante francés con su chaqueta blanca de verano con solapas negras, pero la camisa la salva, no importa el raso. Sus pantalones habrían sido ridículos si no hubieran sido doblados en los tobillos. Los zapatos son de lo que están hechos los finales felices hipster chic. |
| Determining soil hydraulic properties with different wetting liquids : A thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the Degree of Master of Science at Lincoln University<br/><br/>Abstract<br/><br/>Soil hydraulic properties such as hydraulic conductivity, water retention and plant water relationships dominate the water movement processes. For example, the infiltration, evaporation and water flow within the soil. As a widespread phenomenon in soil, soil water repellency alters the soil hydraulic functions by resisting the water flow into the soils. Moreover, the hydraulic properties not only depend on the pore system of soil but also are affected by the physicochemical properties of the pore surfaces. Compared to water, ethanol is not affected by the water repellency due to its lower surface tension. The purpose of using ethanol is to eliminate the effect of soil water repellency on hydraulic properties measurements. However, applying pure ethanol into natural soil can degrade the soil organic materials and lead to changes in physical properties. Therefore, the aqueous ethanol solutions can be an alternative option. Nevertheless, the feasibility of using aqueous ethanol for determining soil liquid retention curve remains unknown. This study aims to test the feasibility of the aqueous ethanol solutions (0, 10 %, 20 %, 30 %, 40 %, 50 % and 100 % v/v) for establishing liquid retention curve under a small range of applied pressure in coarse sand samples with different wettability and organic amended natural soil (Templeton silt loam (TSL) with mushroom compost, biochar, dairy effluent, and municipal compost, the application rate was 15 % by weight). The result showed that the desorption of testing aqueous ethanol solutions compared to water was quicker by approximately 1 to 3x based on the liquid content at the same applied pressure and the time for reaching each equilibrium. The outcomes from the sand experiment suggested that when the concentration of aqueous ethanol solution was below 50 %, the losses via evaporation were less than 1% and the relative differences between testing liquid and water was lower than 10 %. However, the evaporation losses were 11.06 % and 24.6 %, and the relative differences were all around 15 % and 30 % in 50 % and 100 % ethanol solution, respectively. In contrast, the organic amendments in Templeton silt loam not only increased the water retention capability but also reduced the evaporation losses. The evaporation losses in TSL soil and TSL with organic amendments soil were with 1 % in solutions with less than 50 % ethanol content. Evaporation losses of 50 % and 100 % ethanol were 2.8 % and 2.9 %, respectively. The relative differences between water and testing liquid were similar to the sand experiment when the testing liquid concentrations were below 50 %. However, the relative differences in 50 % and 100 % ethanol solution were smaller than in the sand sample with around 10 % and 15%, respectively. Additionally, the analysis of relative difference suggested that almost all aqueous ethanol solutions had lower volumetric liquid content at the same supplied pressure compared to water, which was a reflection of the aqueous ethanol solutions desorbed faster than water under equivalent pressure. Therefore, 10 % to 40 % of ethanol solutions could be considered an alternative for determining soil hydraulic properties due to their faster desorption rate and not being affected by soil water repellency. Due to the evaporation and dissolution of organic material, aqueous ethanol solutions above 50% concentration were not suitable for coarse sand or medium-textured soil.... [Show full abstract] | Determinación de las propiedades hidráulicas del suelo con diferentes líquidos humectantes: una tesis presentada en cumplimiento parcial de los requisitos para el Grado de Maestría en Ciencias de la Universidad de Lincoln<br/><br/>Abstracto<br/><br/>Las propiedades hidráulicas del suelo, como la conductividad hidráulica, la retención de agua y las relaciones del agua de la planta, dominan los procesos de movimiento del agua, por ejemplo, la infiltración, la evaporación y el flujo de agua dentro del suelo. Como un fenómeno generalizado en el suelo, la repelencia del agua del suelo altera las funciones hidráulicas del suelo al resistir el flujo de agua en los suelos. Además, las propiedades hidráulicas no solo dependen del sistema de poros del suelo, sino que también se ven afectadas por las propiedades fisicoquímicas de las superficies de los poros. En comparación con el agua, el etanol no se ve afectado por la repelencia al agua debido a su menor tensión superficial. El propósito de usar etanol es eliminar el efecto de la repelencia del agua del suelo en las mediciones de propiedades hidráulicas. Sin embargo, la aplicación de etanol puro en el suelo natural puede degradar los materiales orgánicos del suelo y provocar cambios en las propiedades físicas. Por lo tanto, las soluciones acuosas de etanol pueden ser una opción alternativa, sin embargo, la viabilidad de usar etanol acuoso para determinar la curva de retención de líquidos del suelo sigue siendo desconocida. Este estudio tiene como objetivo probar la viabilidad de las soluciones acuosas de etanol (0, 10 %, 20 %, 30 %, 40 %, 50 % y 100 % v/v) para establecer la curva de retención de líquidos bajo un pequeño intervalo de presión aplicada en muestras de arena gruesa con diferente humectabilidad y suelo natural modificado orgánico (Templeton loam (TSL) con compost de hongos, biochar, efluente lácteo y compost municipal, la tasa de aplicación fue del 15 % en peso). El resultado mostró que la desorción de las soluciones acuosas de etanol de prueba en comparación con el agua fue más rápida en aproximadamente 1 a 3x en base al contenido líquido a la misma presión aplicada y el tiempo para alcanzar cada equilibrio. Los resultados del experimento con arena sugirieron que cuando la concentración de la solución acuosa de etanol era inferior al 50 %, las pérdidas por evaporación eran inferiores al 1 % y las diferencias relativas entre el líquido de ensayo y el agua eran inferiores al 10 %. Sin embargo, las pérdidas por evaporación fueron de 11,06 % y 24,6 %, y las diferencias relativas fueron todas alrededor de 15 % y 30 % en solución de etanol al 50 % y 100 %, respectivamente. Por el contrario, las modificaciones orgánicas en el limo de Templeton no solo aumentaron la capacidad de retención de agua, sino que también redujeron las pérdidas por evaporación. Las pérdidas por evaporación en suelos TSL y TSL con enmiendas orgánicas fueron del 1 % en soluciones con menos del 50 % de contenido de etanol. Las pérdidas por evaporación del 50 % y 100 % de etanol fueron del 2,8 % y 2,9 %, respectivamente. Las diferencias relativas entre el agua y el líquido de ensayo fueron similares al experimento de arena cuando las concentraciones de líquido de ensayo estaban por debajo del 50%. Sin embargo, las diferencias relativas en la solución de etanol al 50% y al 100% fueron más pequeñas que en la muestra de arena con alrededor del 10% y el 15%, respectivamente. Además, el análisis de la diferencia relativa sugirió que casi todas las soluciones acuosas de etanol tenían un contenido líquido volumétrico más bajo a la misma presión suministrada en comparación con el agua, que era un reflejo de las soluciones acuosas de etanol desorbidas más rápido que el agua a presión equivalente. Por lo tanto, del 10 % al 40 % de las soluciones de etanol podrían considerarse una alternativa para determinar las propiedades hidráulicas del suelo debido a su velocidad de desorción más rápida y a que no se ven afectadas por la repelencia al agua del suelo. Debido a la evaporación y disolución del material orgánico, las soluciones acuosas de etanol por encima del 50% de concentración no eran adecuadas para arena gruesa o suelo de textura media. |
