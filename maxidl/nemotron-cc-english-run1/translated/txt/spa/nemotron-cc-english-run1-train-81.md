| Forty-nine years ago today, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act of 1965.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Nearly a century ago, the 15th Amendment to the Constitution stated, "The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of race, color or previous condition of servitude." And nearly a century before that, our nation's founding fathers set in motion the great experiment of American democracy by declaring that "all men are created equal."<br/><br/>The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was a belated acknowledgment that even in America, our foundational ideals carry little weight if not protected by the rule of law. That's why Section 2 of the 15th Amendment granted Congress the "power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation."<br/><br/>And indeed, the codified language of the Voting Rights Act was able to achieve what the Reconstruction-era Congress and Thomas Jefferson could not. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act—and the civil rights movement from which they emerged—served as the catalyst for a dramatic increase in the opportunity for black Americans to participate in the democratic process.<br/><br/>For example, only 6.7 percent of eligible black Mississippians were registered to vote as of 1962; by 1969 that figure had reached 66.5 percent. Today, Mississippi has more black elected officials than any other state.<br/><br/>The protections put in place by the Voting Rights Act were long overdue when they were passed, representative of the arduous struggle with which they were achieved. But unthinkably, these protections are now under assault, jeopardizing the progress our nation worked so hard to achieve.<br/><br/>Last year, in the case of Shelby County v. Holder, the U.S. Supreme Court gutted a key component of the Voting Rights Act that enabled prior federal review to ensure nondiscrimination before any new voting law went into effect.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Sadly, the response of Republican leaders has been to do nothing. Sen. Ted Cruz and Gov. Rick Perry went out of their way to praise the Supreme Court's decision. Sen. Rand Paul dismissed the continued necessity of the Voting Rights Act by noting, "We have an African-American president."<br/><br/>While the election of President Barack Obama was indeed a historic milestone, it is dangerous to think that it absolves us from remaining vigilant against the lingering consequences of our nation's past. The haste with which states have moved to enact voting restrictions is confirmation that the protections put in place by Section 4 are still necessary.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Republican governors have signed strict photo-identification restrictions into law as the solution to a virtually nonexistent problem of voter impersonation, disproportionately hurting women, young people, working families and the African-American community. It's disingenuous for Republicans like Paul to seek the votes of these communities when they believe "there's nothing wrong with" putting restrictions in place that make it harder for these constituencies to vote.<br/><br/>Republicans have also sought to restrict early-voting periods, including the Sunday before Election Day, when African-American churches have had great success with Souls to the Polls programs.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>These restrictions represent a callous effort by Republicans to make voting harder, based on narrow, short-term political calculations that Republicans can win elections by shrinking the size of the electorate.<br/><br/>Democrats have a very different mission when it comes to voting: to ensure that every eligible voter can register, that every registered voter can vote and that every vote is accurately counted.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>The Democratic National Committee's Voter Expansion Project reflects our belief that greater voter participation strengthens our nation and our democracy. We'll continue to use our unmatched institutional knowledge to protect voting rights against legislation and tactics that would attempt to suppress the vote. And because the best defense is a good offense, we're also working to expand the vote by deploying our technology and data resources to register new voters.<br/><br/>On this anniversary, one of the best ways we can honor those who struggled—and in some cases gave their very lives—for the legislation's passage is for Republicans in Congress to join Democrats in passing the Voting Rights Amendment Act to restore the promise of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Democrat, represents Florida's 23rd Congressional District in the United States Congress. Since 2011, she has served as chair of the Democratic National Committee.

Johnson firmó la Ley de Derecho al Voto de 1965.<br/><br/>Publicidad<br/><br/>Hace casi un siglo, la Decimoquinta Enmienda a la Constitución declaró: "El derecho de los ciudadanos de los Estados Unidos a votar no será negado ni limitado por los Estados Unidos ni por ningún estado debido a su raza, color o condición previa de servidumbre". Y casi un siglo antes de eso, los padres fundadores de nuestra nación pusieron en marcha el gran experimento de la democracia estadounidense al declarar que "todos los hombres son creados iguales".<br/><br/>La Ley de Derecho al Voto de 1965 fue un reconocimiento tardío de que incluso en Estados Unidos, nuestros ideales fundacionales tienen poco peso si no están protegidos por el estado de derecho. Es por eso que la Sección 2 de la Decimoquinta Enmienda otorgó al Congreso el “poder de hacer cumplir este artículo mediante la legislación apropiada”.<br/><br/>Y, de hecho, el lenguaje codificado de la Ley de Derecho al Voto fue capaz de lograr lo que el Congreso de la era de la Reconstrucción y Thomas Jefferson no pudieron. La Ley de Derechos Civiles de 1964 y la Ley de Derechos Electorales, y el movimiento de derechos civiles del que surgieron, sirvieron como catalizador para un aumento dramático en la oportunidad de que los estadounidenses negros participen en el proceso democrático.<br/><br/>Por ejemplo, solo el 6,7 por ciento de los negros elegibles de Mississippi estaban registrados para votar a partir de 1962; para 1969 esa cifra había alcanzado el 66,5 por ciento. Hoy en día, Mississippi tiene más funcionarios electos negros que cualquier otro estado.<br/><br/>Las protecciones puestas en marcha por la Ley de Derecho al Voto estaban muy retrasadas cuando se aprobaron, representativas de la ardua lucha con la que se lograron. Pero, inconcebiblemente, estas protecciones ahora están bajo ataque, poniendo en peligro el progreso por el que nuestra nación trabajó tan duro para lograr.<br/><br/>Holder, la Corte Suprema de los Estados Unidos destruyó un componente clave de la Ley de Derechos Electorales que permitió una revisión federal previa para garantizar la no discriminación antes de que entrara en vigencia cualquier nueva ley de votación.<br/><br/>Publicidad<br/><br/>Lamentablemente, la respuesta de los líderes republicanos ha sido no hacer nada. El senador Ted Cruz y el gobernador Rick Perry hicieron todo lo posible para elogiar la decisión de la Corte Suprema. El senador Rand Paul desestimó la continua necesidad de la Ley de Derecho al Voto al señalar: "Tenemos un presidente afroamericano".<br/><br/>Si bien la elección del presidente Barack Obama fue de hecho un hito histórico, es peligroso pensar que nos absuelve de permanecer vigilantes contra las consecuencias persistentes del pasado de nuestra nación. La prisa con la que los estados se han movido para promulgar restricciones de votación es la confirmación de que las protecciones establecidas por la Sección 4 siguen siendo necesarias.<br/><br/>Publicidad<br/><br/>Los gobernadores republicanos han promulgado estrictas restricciones de identificación con fotos como la solución a un problema prácticamente inexistente de suplantación de votantes, que perjudica desproporcionadamente a las mujeres, los jóvenes, las familias trabajadoras y la comunidad afroamericana. Es falso que los republicanos como Paul busquen los votos de estas comunidades cuando creen que "no hay nada malo en" establecer restricciones que dificulten el voto de estos distritos electorales.<br/><br/>Los republicanos también han tratado de restringir los períodos de votación temprana, incluido el domingo anterior al día de las elecciones, cuando las iglesias afroamericanas han tenido un gran éxito con los programas Souls to the Polls.<br/><br/>Publicidad<br/><br/>Estas restricciones representan un insensible esfuerzo de los republicanos para dificultar el voto, basado en cálculos políticos estrechos y a corto plazo de que los republicanos pueden ganar elecciones reduciendo el tamaño del electorado.<br/><br/>Los demócratas tienen una misión muy diferente cuando se trata de votar: garantizar que cada votante elegible pueda registrarse, que cada votante registrado pueda votar y que cada voto se cuente con precisión.<br/><br/>Publicidad<br/><br/>El Proyecto de Expansión de Votantes del Comité Nacional Demócrata refleja nuestra creencia de que una mayor participación de los votantes fortalece nuestra nación y nuestra democracia. Continuaremos utilizando nuestro conocimiento institucional sin igual para proteger el derecho al voto contra la legislación y las tácticas que intentarían suprimir el voto. Y debido a que la mejor defensa es una buena ofensiva, también estamos trabajando para expandir el voto mediante el despliegue de nuestra tecnología y recursos de datos para registrar nuevos votantes.<br/><br/>En este aniversario, una de las mejores maneras en que podemos honrar a aquellos que lucharon, y en algunos casos dieron sus propias vidas, porque la aprobación de la legislación es que los republicanos en el Congreso se unan a los demócratas para aprobar la Ley de Enmienda del Derecho al Voto para restaurar la promesa de la Ley de Derecho al Voto de 1965.<br/><br/>Publicidad<br/><br/>Debbie Wasserman Schultz, una demócrata, representa al 23o Distrito Congresional de Florida en el Congreso de los Estados Unidos.

| Q&A: Vatican safeguarding expert Fr Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>13 June 2021<br/><br/>Fr Hans Zollner SJ. Image: Australian Jesuits.<br/><br/>The President of the Centre for Child Protection at the Gregorian University in Rome, and a member of the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors, Fr Hans Zollner SJ, was in Australia in 2018 to speak to Catholic ministry leaders and survivors.<br/><br/>Michael McVeigh from Jesuit Communications sat down with him during the visit to explore how the Church is responding to the abuse crisis internationally, and what can be learned from our experiences in Australia.<br/><br/>MM: This is your third trip to Australia. You've visited quite a few other countries to see how the Church is responding to abuse around the world. Can you give us some idea of what the global picture looks like?<br/><br/>Fr Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>HZ: My understanding, after having visited about 50 countries on five or six continents, is that the Church is really starting to move over the last couple of years on the issue of doing justice to victims, of listening to them, and doing whatever can be done in terms of safeguarding.<br/><br/>I was with the Jesuit Provincials from all over Africa at the end of April, and the President of the Jesuit Assistancy of Africa and Madagascar is very much committed and dedicated to this. He has put up a thorough action plan for formation and for introducing guidelines all over the place. It's a very considerate and very deliberate effort to do whatever can be done to be proactively engaged as Jesuits in Africa — in a continent where until a few years ago all of this was a foreign language.<br/><br/>One of the challenges of trying to develop this global approach is that you're dealing with so many cultures, and so many different understandings. How do you bring this together and try to provide training and support religious communities tackling these issues?<br/><br/>This is one of the major questions we have. I think what I can do is stimulate discussion, stimulate reflection, and prepare people as much as possible so that they can do the groundwork.<br/><br/>The Centre for Child Protection at the Gregorian University does not pretend to have the response to every question. Not only because we don't know the specific contexts — we might know a few of them, but we're talking about thousands of cultures, we're talking about hundreds of languages, we're talking about very diverse legal backgrounds. It varies even sometimes within one country, such as Australia where you have states within the Commonwealth of Australia that have different laws than other states.<br/><br/>I am somebody who tries to elicit and stimulate discussion and reflection. I'm also very happy to listen to people.<br/><br/>You mentioned the need to listen and support victims in being heard. We've obviously had the Royal Commission here in Australia, but what are some of the other ways that you've seen that the voices of victims are being supported around the world?<br/><br/>In France there is one diocese that has established what they call 'The Listening Space'. There, victims can come forward and they can express themselves. The bishop is present. It's an open space in which people who have been hurt tremendously are free at least to express what they want to ask from the Church leadership etc.<br/><br/>There are other places in the USA or in other countries where victims have been invited by dioceses, by Provinces, by the leadership of the Church, to come forward. I have to say that overall I think there is a good will, and there are more people like bishops and provincials who listen to victims than we know. But there is no one model of giving victims not only the space to express themselves and be listened to, but also to engage actively in Church development.<br/><br/>In terms of setting up spaces for support for victims, what are some of the things you've seen that could really help — and that we could be considering here in Australia?<br/><br/>One of the major points that many victims bring up is, 'Can't we have, within parish settings, within schools settings, a regular conversation going on that includes survivors of abuse as regular members of a committee, a commission, a sounding board, a feedback group or something like that?' So that this voice is not only brought in on a specific occasion, or where a person feels like he or she is at a point to be able to speak out about it, but [is heard] on a regular basis — build that voice into the system.<br/><br/>That will help all of us. It will help survivors and victims because they will feel welcome and appreciated in the specific experience, and in the specific life challenges, that they went through. Secondly it will help the community at large, because we can at least make ourselves more and more sensitive to what the concerns and specific needs of survivors are — that can also talk to the needs of young people.<br/><br/>M: We have strong groups of survivors here in Australia who have been able to support each other through that process. But what you're saying is that we need some way of supporting those groups, and supporting those people, through our own institutions as well?<br/><br/>And I think we need to be creative. It will work for one school and one parish and one diocese in one way, and for others in a different way. Because the survivors with whom I am in constant contact, they have quite similar requests, and similar experiences in regard to being welcomed in the Church or not — feeling thrown out or dismissed. But they have also among themselves quite different expectations. So I have learned that you have also to be very forthcoming in accepting the differences in what this specific group, or this specific survivor, wants, requests and needs.<br/><br/>M: Survivors talk about wanting to have their stories heard and acknowledged. We've had the Royal Commission here in Australia, which provided an independent process where victims could come forward. Is there a need for something like that in terms of a truth, justice and reconciliation process for the Church internationally?<br/><br/>H: Yes, I think there is a need for that internationally. But I think first every local church needs to do its own homework. I don't see it happening very soon that some such council or commission would be established to look into this area for the whole Church. The Church has a membership of 1.3 billion people, and is present in 190 countries, with all kinds of differences in expectations concerning psychological, spiritual and financial support.<br/><br/>There is one thing that I have come across consistently in communicating with, working with and listening to victims, and that is that they want to be listened to. So if there was the feeling that victims were constantly being listened to — in Rome and elsewhere — I think that would give a great relief to many victims.<br/><br/>I think [Pope Francis'] concern, especially with regard to your question, is that the local churches do whatever they can so that victims will be listened to in that particular country. I have a list of people who want to speak to the Holy Father directly, and physically it is impossible. I was there in 2014 to translate for two German survivors who were chosen with two Irish and two English survivors when he received the six of them at home. He took the whole morning listening to them one after the other. For each one, he was there for 40 to 45 minutes. Were he to do this for every survivor he couldn't sleep anymore.<br/><br/>His example is modelling for the whole Catholic Church the way victims and survivors are received, welcomed and listened to. I think if the bishops and the provincials in this world, in all countries, followed his example, many survivors would be really appreciative of that.<br/><br/>Archbishop Diarmud Martin was recently quoted just before the World Meeting of Families, about the Pontifical Commission, saying that it's too small as it's currently set up to achieve what it needs to achieve. What's your take on that? Does the Church need to be putting more resources into how it's overseeing those issues?<br/><br/>At the moment we are 16 members from basically all continents, and the major language groups. We represent a variety of disciplines and professions, and the purpose of the commission — as the statutes that have just been promulgated state — is to provide counsel to the Holy Father.<br/><br/>A common misunderstanding about the commission is first that we deal with cases of allegations. That is not the case. We have no juridical or administrative power in regards to cases, because when it comes to allegations of abuse the tribunals and procedure are set.<br/><br/>A second misunderstanding is that we promote, directly, things on the ground. Our first and foremost goal is that we advise the Holy Father on issues.<br/><br/>So from my point of view, yes, we need to invest more. But we need to invest more on the local level, and we need to make sure that the proposals from the Pontifical Commission are forwarded to the Holy Father — which normally the President does — and then there is a follow-up process that reflects what we have given as our advice.<br/><br/>In Australia, Catholic Professional Standards Limited is overseeing the Church's response and providing guidelines and support for ensuring all the institutions in the Church are child-safe institutions. Is there a need for some kind of organisational support from Rome for those bishops and dioceses that are struggling to form these institutions and provide safeguarding in those dioceses?<br/><br/>I think ultimately the commission will develop in that line. They are now in the process of hiring experts in those areas.<br/><br/>I think the Church needs to understand that the local churches can learn from each other mutually. And my understanding has always been — and I think the Holy Father has reminded us — that the Church will not function as a centralised company. It does not work like that, effectively. Every bishop, every bishops conference, has, to some extent, its life on its own. What we need to learn more is to open channels of mutual communication.<br/><br/>There are a number of things that people blame for abuse in the Church. As a priest and a psychologist, and as someone who has met and worked with survivors, what are your thoughts on that issue?<br/><br/>I think the question of where does abuse come from is the most important one, and the Pope has addressed that in his letter to the people of God published on 20 August. He says in the first paragraph, and repeats it over and over again, that the question of sexual abuse is always linked — or almost always linked — not only to the question of abuse of power, but also to the abuse of conscience.<br/><br/>So the real fundamental question of abuse is much more complex than just [the question of] sexuality — be it heterosexual or homosexual. It's a power issue, and there we have to really work on the question of how do we understand priesthood, how to we understand bishophood, how do we understand and live out our ministries? What are the boundaries?<br/><br/>That's why I'm very happy that the Jesuit Province in Australia is establishing a Code of Conduct. Because we don't talk only about sexual abuse of minors. We talk about sexual abuse of adults, and we talk about abuse in other ways — like abuse of conscience, where you dictate to someone what you think, or you pretend to know by God, and you can tell another person, 'You need to do that', against the conscience of that person.<br/><br/>Many people think celibacy produces abuse. As I always say, celibacy as such is not cause for abusing — otherwise how do we explain that 99.9 per cent of all abusers do not live a celibate life, and how do we explain that 95 or 96 per cent of all priests do not abuse minors? But, celibacy, or a vow of chastity, that is not really integrated, that is not really lived out properly — yes, that produces a problem. Sometimes people take to drinking, sometime they take to gambling, and sometimes they take to sexual misconduct, with adults and with minors.<br/><br/>The real question about this is how do we deal with the notion of religious spiritual power with which priests and bishops are invested? How can theology help us to understand, and maybe how can sociology, psychology, or business administration help us to define the limits of power, and the necessity of keeping your boundaries | Preguntas y respuestas: P. Hans Zollner SJ, experto en salvaguardias del Vaticano<br/><br/>13 de junio de 2021<br/><br/>P. Hans Zollner SJ. Imagen: Jesuitas australianos.<br/><br/>El presidente del Centro para la Protección de la Infancia de la Universidad Gregoriana de Roma y miembro de la Pontificia Comisión para la Protección de los Menores, el padre Hans Zollner SJ, estuvo en Australia en 2018 para hablar con los líderes y sobrevivientes del ministerio católico.<br/><br/>Michael McVeigh de Jesuit Communications se sentó con él durante la visita para explorar cómo la Iglesia está respondiendo a la crisis de abuso a nivel internacional, y lo que se puede aprender de nuestras experiencias en Australia.<br/><br/>MM: Este es su tercer viaje a Australia. Usted ha visitado muchos otros países para ver cómo la Iglesia está respondiendo al abuso en todo el mundo. ¿Puede darnos una idea de cómo es el panorama global?<br/><br/>P. Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>HZ: Lo que entiendo, después de haber visitado unos 50 países en cinco o seis continentes, es que la Iglesia realmente está empezando a moverse en los últimos años sobre el tema de hacer justicia a las víctimas, de escucharlas y hacer lo que se pueda en términos de protección.<br/><br/>Estuve con los Provinciales Jesuitas de toda África a finales de abril, y el Presidente de la Asistencia Jesuita de África y Madagascar está muy comprometido y dedicado a esto. Ha presentado un plan de acción exhaustivo para la formación y para la introducción de directrices en todo el lugar. Es un esfuerzo muy considerado y muy deliberado hacer lo que se pueda hacer para participar proactivamente como jesuitas en África, en un continente donde hasta hace unos años todo esto era un idioma extranjero.<br/><br/>Uno de los desafíos de tratar de desarrollar este enfoque global es que se trata de tantas culturas y tantos entendimientos diferentes. ¿Cómo reúnes esto y tratas de proporcionar capacitación y apoyo a las comunidades religiosas que abordan estos problemas?<br/><br/>Creo que lo que puedo hacer es estimular la discusión, estimular la reflexión y preparar a la gente tanto como sea posible para que puedan hacer el trabajo preliminar.<br/><br/>El Centro de Protección de la Infancia de la Universidad Gregoriana no pretende tener la respuesta a todas las preguntas. No solo porque no conocemos los contextos específicos, sino que estamos hablando de miles de culturas, estamos hablando de cientos de idiomas, estamos hablando de antecedentes legales muy diversos. Varía incluso a veces dentro de un país, como Australia, donde tiene estados dentro de la Commonwealth de Australia que tienen leyes diferentes a las de otros estados.<br/><br/>Soy alguien que trata de provocar y estimular la discusión y la reflexión. También estoy muy feliz de escuchar a la gente.<br/><br/>Obviamente hemos tenido la Comisión Real aquí en Australia, pero ¿cuáles son algunas de las otras formas en que han visto que las voces de las víctimas están siendo apoyadas en todo el mundo?<br/><br/>En Francia hay una diócesis que ha establecido lo que ellos llaman 'El Espacio de la Escucha'. Allí, las víctimas pueden presentarse y pueden expresarse. El obispo está presente. Es un espacio abierto en el que las personas que han sido tremendamente heridas son libres al menos de expresar lo que quieren pedir al liderazgo de la Iglesia, etc.<br/><br/>Hay otros lugares en los Estados Unidos o en otros países donde las víctimas han sido invitadas por las diócesis, por las provincias, por el liderazgo de la Iglesia, para presentarse. Tengo que decir que, en general, creo que hay una buena voluntad, y hay más personas como obispos y provinciales que escuchan a las víctimas de lo que sabemos. Pero no hay un solo modelo de dar a las víctimas no solo el espacio para expresarse y ser escuchadas, sino también para participar activamente en el desarrollo de la Iglesia.<br/><br/>En términos de establecer espacios de apoyo para las víctimas, ¿cuáles son algunas de las cosas que han visto que realmente podrían ayudar, y que podríamos estar considerando aquí en Australia?<br/><br/>Uno de los puntos principales que muchas víctimas mencionan es: ‘¿No podemos tener, dentro de los entornos parroquiales, dentro de los entornos escolares, una conversación regular que incluya a los sobrevivientes de abuso como miembros regulares de un comité, una comisión, una caja de resonancia, un grupo de retroalimentación o algo así?’ Para que esta voz no solo sea traída en una ocasión específica, o cuando una persona siente que está en un punto para poder hablar sobre ella, sino que [se escucha] regularmente: construye esa voz en el sistema.<br/><br/>Eso nos ayudará a todos, ayudará a los sobrevivientes y a las víctimas porque se sentirán bienvenidos y apreciados en la experiencia específica y en los desafíos específicos de la vida por los que pasaron. En segundo lugar, ayudará a la comunidad en general, porque al menos podemos ser cada vez más sensibles a cuáles son las preocupaciones y las necesidades específicas de los sobrevivientes, que también pueden hablar de las necesidades de los jóvenes.<br/><br/>M: Tenemos grupos fuertes de sobrevivientes aquí en Australia que han podido apoyarse mutuamente a través de ese proceso. Pero lo que está diciendo es que necesitamos alguna forma de apoyar a esos grupos, y apoyar a esas personas, a través de nuestras propias instituciones también.<br/><br/>Y creo que tenemos que ser creativos. Funcionará para una escuela y una parroquia y una diócesis de una manera, y para otros de una manera diferente. Debido a que los sobrevivientes con los que estoy en contacto constante, tienen peticiones bastante similares, y experiencias similares con respecto a ser bienvenidos en la Iglesia o no, sintiéndose expulsados o despedidos. Pero también tienen entre sí expectativas muy diferentes, por lo que he aprendido que también hay que ser muy comunicativo al aceptar las diferencias en lo que este grupo específico, o este sobreviviente específico, quiere, pide y necesita.<br/><br/>M: Los sobrevivientes hablan de querer que sus historias sean escuchadas y reconocidas. Hemos tenido la Comisión Real aquí en Australia, que proporcionó un proceso independiente donde las víctimas podían presentarse. ¿Hay necesidad de algo así en términos de un proceso de verdad, justicia y reconciliación para la Iglesia a nivel internacional?<br/><br/>H: Sí, creo que hay una necesidad de que a nivel internacional. Pero creo que primero cada iglesia local tiene que hacer su propia tarea. No veo que suceda muy pronto que se establezca algún consejo o comisión de este tipo para investigar esta área para toda la Iglesia. La Iglesia tiene una membresía de 1.300 millones de personas, y está presente en 190 países, con todo tipo de diferencias en las expectativas con respecto al apoyo psicológico, espiritual y financiero.<br/><br/>Hay una cosa con la que me he encontrado consistentemente al comunicarme, trabajar y escuchar a las víctimas, y es que quieren ser escuchadas. Así que si hubiera la sensación de que las víctimas estaban siendo escuchadas constantemente, en Roma y en otros lugares, creo que eso daría un gran alivio a muchas víctimas.<br/><br/>Creo que su preocupación, especialmente con respecto a su pregunta, es que las iglesias locales hagan lo que puedan para que las víctimas sean escuchadas en ese país en particular. Tengo una lista de personas que quieren hablar con el Santo Padre directamente, y físicamente es imposible. Estuve allí en 2014 para traducir para dos sobrevivientes alemanes que fueron elegidos con dos sobrevivientes irlandeses y dos sobrevivientes ingleses cuando recibió a los seis en casa. Se tomó toda la mañana escuchándolos uno tras otro. Para cada uno, estuvo allí durante 40 a 45 minutos. Si hiciera esto por cada sobreviviente, no podría dormir más.<br/><br/>Su ejemplo es modelar para toda la Iglesia Católica la forma en que las víctimas y los sobrevivientes son recibidos, recibidos y escuchados. Creo que si los obispos y los provinciales en este mundo, en todos los países, siguieran su ejemplo, muchos sobrevivientes estarían realmente agradecidos por eso.<br/><br/>El arzobispo Diarmud Martin fue citado recientemente justo antes del Encuentro Mundial de las Familias, sobre la Pontificia Comisión, diciendo que es demasiado pequeña, ya que actualmente está configurada para lograr lo que necesita lograr. ¿Cuál es su opinión sobre eso? ¿Necesita la Iglesia poner más recursos en cómo está supervisando esos asuntos?<br/><br/>En este momento somos 16 miembros de básicamente todos los continentes, y los principales grupos de idiomas. Representamos una variedad de disciplinas y profesiones, y el propósito de la comisión, como los estatutos que acaban de promulgarse, es proporcionar consejo al Santo Padre.<br/><br/>Un malentendido común acerca de la comisión es, en primer lugar, que nos ocupamos de los casos de alegaciones, pero no es así. No tenemos poder jurídico o administrativo en lo que respecta a los casos, porque cuando se trata de denuncias de abuso se establecen los tribunales y el procedimiento.<br/><br/>Un segundo malentendido es que promovemos, directamente, las cosas sobre el terreno. Nuestro primer y principal objetivo es que asesoremos al Santo Padre sobre temas.<br/><br/>Así que desde mi punto de vista, sí, necesitamos invertir más. Pero necesitamos invertir más a nivel local, y debemos asegurarnos de que las propuestas de la Comisión Pontificia se transmitan al Santo Padre, lo que normalmente hace el Presidente, y luego hay un proceso de seguimiento que refleja lo que hemos dado como nuestro consejo.<br/><br/>En Australia, Catholic Professional Standards Limited supervisa la respuesta de la Iglesia y proporciona directrices y apoyo para garantizar que todas las instituciones de la Iglesia sean instituciones seguras para los niños. ¿Hay necesidad de algún tipo de apoyo organizativo de Roma para aquellos obispos y diócesis que están luchando para formar estas instituciones y proporcionar protección en esas diócesis?<br/><br/>Creo que, en última instancia, la comisión se desarrollará en esa línea y ahora está contratando expertos en esas áreas.<br/><br/>Creo que la Iglesia debe entender que las iglesias locales pueden aprender unas de otras, y mi entendimiento siempre ha sido, y creo que el Santo Padre nos lo ha recordado, que la Iglesia no funcionará como una compañía centralizada. No funciona así, efectivamente. Cada obispo, cada conferencia episcopal, tiene, hasta cierto punto, su vida por sí misma. Lo que necesitamos aprender más es abrir canales de comunicación mutua.<br/><br/>Hay una serie de cosas que la gente culpa por el abuso en la Iglesia. Como sacerdote y psicólogo, y como alguien que se ha reunido y trabajado con sobrevivientes, ¿cuáles son sus pensamientos sobre ese tema?<br/><br/>Creo que la pregunta de dónde viene el abuso es la más importante, y el Papa lo ha dirigido en su carta al pueblo de Dios publicada el 20 de agosto. Dice en el primer párrafo, y lo repite una y otra vez, que la cuestión del abuso sexual está siempre vinculada, o casi siempre vinculada, no solo a la cuestión del abuso de poder, sino también al abuso de conciencia.<br/><br/>Así que la verdadera cuestión fundamental del abuso es mucho más compleja que solo [la cuestión de] la sexualidad, ya sea heterosexual u homosexual. Es una cuestión de poder, y allí tenemos que trabajar realmente en la cuestión de cómo entendemos el sacerdocio, cómo entendemos el obispado, ¿cómo entendemos y vivimos nuestros ministerios?<br/><br/>Es por eso que estoy muy feliz de que la Provincia Jesuita en Australia esté estableciendo un Código de Conducta, porque no hablamos solo de abuso sexual de menores. Hablamos de abuso sexual de adultos, y hablamos de abuso de otras maneras, como el abuso de conciencia, donde le dictas a alguien lo que piensas, o pretendes saber por Dios, y puedes decirle a otra persona: ‘Tienes que hacer eso’, en contra de la conciencia de esa persona.<br/><br/>Mucha gente piensa que el celibato produce abuso. Como siempre digo, el celibato como tal no es motivo para abusar, de lo contrario, ¿cómo explicamos que el 99.9 por ciento de todos los abusadores no viven una vida célibe, y cómo explicamos que el 95 o el 96 por ciento de todos los sacerdotes no abusan de los menores? Pero, el celibato, o un voto de castidad, que no está realmente integrado, que no está realmente vivido correctamente, sí, eso produce un problema. A veces la gente toma a la bebida, a veces toman a los juegos de azar, y a veces toman a la mala conducta sexual, con adultos y con menores de edad.<br/><br/>La verdadera pregunta acerca de esto es ¿cómo lidiamos con la noción de poder espiritual religioso con el que los sacerdotes y obispos están investidos? ¿Cómo puede la teología ayudarnos a entender, y tal vez cómo puede la sociología, la psicología o la administración de empresas ayudarnos a definir los límites del poder y la necesidad de mantener sus límites? |
| I'm not surprised by this mismatch. In fact, I'd even go so far as to say this isn't something that will ever change, nor should we get all steamed up about changing it. In 10 years, we'll still have bleeding edge, complex items in the biggest concerns list, and the things we're finally getting around to understanding will be the major parts of our spending.<br/><br/>Now, Gunnar and Andy both have excellent points, specifically about IT teams seeing IT problems and solving them with IT solutions; in fact, I'm positive their points hold merit.<br/><br/>But I think there are other ideas that trump those (I did comment on their blogs about it, and later decided I should just blog here). Those top 3 concerns are bleedingly new such that:<br/><br/>we fear new things because we don't understand them, or don't understand them because they're new.<br/><br/>they're too new for us to have solid approaches to handling them.<br/><br/>they're too new for us to know if we should be worried or not! we tend to default to paranoid/worried, which is good!<br/><br/>too new to have obvious budget items assigned to them. Can I buy a box or some software that provide "cloud security" or "social media security?"<br/><br/>they're so new the business doesn't even know how to use them or what they want out of them. Let alone how we can secure them while still meeting or at least not stomping all over business needs. If the business doesn't even know how to use them yet, I'm not sure security is in any position to guide that usage securely.<br/><br/>It also should be mentioned that these new things are being largely pushed via consumerland and into the business, with IT as a sort of, "Oh yeah," thought. Firewalls, AV, AM, Auth are all IT responses to typically IT issues. Of course there is a difference there. They're also very subjective issues, as opposed to very objective items like firewalls, known malicious bits, behaviors, signatures, ports. Business presents very complex issues that are often involving people (which we can't patch) and that often don't fit nicely into blanket rules. Even if we turned away from technical solutions and devoted our time into solving these problems, they are still not going to be neatly solved. Likewise, when push comes to shove, can you have and meet goals with firewalls? Can you show improvement? All of this flows from the rather subjective non-technical aspect of those issues. Sort of the difference between a child's report card and the feedback you get from a parent-teacher conference. If you have a child, which one would you be most inclined to disagree with or not necessarily believe? (The answer is the subjective one!)<br/><br/>It could be said this is the natural progression of security and technology: from shoring up the technical controls to moving up the stack towards behavior and people. Sure, these 3 top concerns can be said to punch through firewalls and network segments, but that's the nature of those things (social media "punching" through a firewall is far different than me punching through an SSH connection to bridge my home network; social media is akin to the *way* I use my SSH connection after the hold is already punched because it is needed; i.e. social media is the way port 80 is used.)<br/><br/>Basically, all indications point to not being surprised by this dichotomy. And I don't think this is some further indication that IT/security is doing it wrong, or isn't aligned properly with business, or has a technical dark-server-room background. I'm not saying we're doing things right or we're properly aligned, but the above isn't a good argument to support the theory of those deficiencies.<br/><br/>Now for a really big jump. I'd liken the current increase in mobile computing to be as big as the introduction of computers into the business and later the PC/internet into business. Now, I wasn't around when the former happened, nor was I in the industry when the personal computer revolution swept into business, but I would bet that is the closest comparison so far. I may even say the same for social media. These are damned new and they're big changes beyond just bringing in Macs or new software or some new business process. | No me sorprende este desajuste, de hecho, incluso diría que esto no es algo que vaya a cambiar, ni deberíamos preocuparnos por cambiarlo. En 10 años, todavía tendremos cosas complejas en la lista de preocupaciones más grandes, y las cosas que finalmente estamos entendiendo serán la mayor parte de nuestros gastos.<br/><br/>Ahora, Gunnar y Andy tienen excelentes puntos, específicamente sobre los equipos de TI que ven problemas de TI y los resuelven con soluciones de TI; de hecho, estoy seguro de que sus puntos tienen mérito.<br/><br/>Pero creo que hay otras ideas que triunfan sobre ellos (comenté en sus blogs al respecto, y más tarde decidí que debería bloguear aquí). Esas 3 principales preocupaciones son sangrantemente nuevas de tal manera que:<br/><br/>Tememos a las cosas nuevas porque no las entendemos, o no las entendemos porque son nuevas.<br/><br/>Son demasiado nuevos para que tengamos enfoques sólidos para manejarlos.<br/><br/>¡Son demasiado nuevos para que sepamos si deberíamos estar preocupados o no! tendemos a paranoicos / preocupados, ¡lo cual es bueno!<br/><br/>¿Puedo comprar una caja o algún software que proporcione "seguridad en la nube" o "seguridad en las redes sociales"?<br/><br/>son tan nuevos que el negocio ni siquiera sabe cómo usarlos o lo que quieren de ellos. Y mucho menos cómo podemos asegurarlos sin dejar de satisfacer o al menos no pisotear todas las necesidades comerciales. Si la empresa ni siquiera sabe cómo usarlos todavía, no estoy seguro de que la seguridad esté en condiciones de guiar ese uso de forma segura.<br/><br/>También hay que mencionar que estas nuevas cosas están siendo impulsadas en gran medida a través de los consumidores y en el negocio, con TI como una especie de "Oh, sí", pensó. Firewalls, AV, AM, Auth son todas las respuestas de TI a los problemas típicos de TI. También son cuestiones muy subjetivas, a diferencia de elementos muy objetivos como cortafuegos, bits maliciosos conocidos, comportamientos, firmas y puertos. Los negocios presentan problemas muy complejos que a menudo involucran a las personas (que no podemos parchear) y que a menudo no encajan bien en las reglas generales. Incluso si nos alejamos de las soluciones técnicas y dedicamos nuestro tiempo a resolver estos problemas, todavía no se van a resolver perfectamente. Del mismo modo, cuando se trata de empujar, ¿puedes tener y cumplir objetivos con firewalls? ¿Puedes mostrar una mejora? Todo esto fluye desde el aspecto no técnico bastante subjetivo de esos problemas. Tipo de la diferencia entre la libreta de calificaciones de un niño y la retroalimentación que obtiene de una conferencia de padres y maestros. Si tienes un hijo, ¿con cuál estarías más inclinado a estar en desacuerdo o no necesariamente creer? (¡La respuesta es subjetiva!)<br/><br/>Se podría decir que esta es la progresión natural de la seguridad y la tecnología: desde apuntalar los controles técnicos hasta avanzar hacia el comportamiento y las personas. Claro, se puede decir que estas 3 principales preocupaciones atraviesan los cortafuegos y los segmentos de red, pero esa es la naturaleza de esas cosas (las redes sociales "perforan" a través de un cortafuegos es muy diferente a mí perforando a través de una conexión SSH para unir mi red doméstica; las redes sociales son similares a la "manera" en la que uso mi conexión SSH después de que la retención ya está perforada porque es necesaria; es decir, las redes sociales son la forma en que se usa el puerto 80).<br/><br/>Básicamente, todos los indicios apuntan a no sorprenderse por esta dicotomía. Y no creo que esto sea una indicación más de que TI / seguridad lo esté haciendo mal, o no esté alineado correctamente con los negocios, o tenga un fondo técnico de sala de servidores oscuros. No estoy diciendo que estamos haciendo las cosas bien o que estamos correctamente alineados, pero lo anterior no es un buen argumento para apoyar la teoría de esas deficiencias.<br/><br/>Ahora, para dar un salto realmente grande, me gustaría que el aumento actual de la informática móvil fuera tan grande como la introducción de las computadoras en el negocio y más tarde la PC / Internet en el negocio. Ahora, yo no estaba presente cuando sucedió lo primero, ni estaba en la industria cuando la revolución de las computadoras personales entró en el negocio, pero apuesto a que es la comparación más cercana hasta ahora. Estos son malditamente nuevos y son grandes cambios más allá de solo traer Macs o nuevo software o algún nuevo proceso de negocios. |
