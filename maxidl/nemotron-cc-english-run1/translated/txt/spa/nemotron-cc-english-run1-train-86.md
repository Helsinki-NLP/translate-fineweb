| Leclaire<br/><br/>The historic Leclaire neighborhood, once referred to as Edwardsville's "suburb to the south," was founded as a cooperative community in 1890 and remained a separate village until annexed to the city of Edwardsville in 1934. Newspapers and magazines throughout the United States and Europe reported on the Leclaire experiment, particularly during the first 20 years of its existence. In 1979, due to its unique history, the former village was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.<br/><br/>Leclaire was founded by Nelson Oliver Nelson, a St. Louis plumbing manufacturer who, for many years, sought to advance the plight of the working class. Nelson wanted to improve working conditions for his employees and provide housing near the factories so workers and their families could easily participate in recreational and educational programs offered free of charge by the company. Prior to 1890, while still in St. Louis, the N. O. Nelson Company's manufacturing and distribution businesses began providing profit sharing along with educational and recreational opportunities. The Leclaire cooperative experiment would bring additional benefits.<br/><br/>When Nelson employees indicated they wanted to relocate to a rural location, company representatives approached leaders of small towns in several Missouri and Illinois communities near their St. Louis headquarters. They were looking for a suitable property to build new factories and a model village. South of Edwardsville they found a 125-acre tract of land with access to water, coal, and transportation. Local businessmen acted quickly to offer a financial incentive. In less than three weeks, the community raised a fund of $20,000 from individual contributions of between $1 and $1,000 to entice Nelson to choose Edwardsville for his enterprise.<br/><br/>City leaders had hoped to locate property inside the city limits of Edwardsville, but when no suitable site could be found, they were confident that the Nelson investment south of town would soon become a part of Edwardsville. Although Nelson fulfilled all the contingencies for construction and job creation in his contract, it would be 44 years before annexation to Edwardsville. Leclaire, bounded by Madison/Brown Avenues to the east, the railroad tracks to the west, Hadley/McKinley Avenues on the south and Wolf Street to the north, remained an independent village from 1890 to 1934. During that time it earned a reputation for innovations in business, education and residential planning.<br/><br/>The village of Leclaire on a 1931 map of Edwardsville<br/>Courtesy of Paul Jenkins<br/><br/>Nelson's decision to build a village was not made on a whim. By the late 1880s he was an international leader in the fields of cooperation and profit-sharing, exchanging social theories with others around the world while expanding his St. Louis business. He named his experimental village after the Parisian profit-sharer, Edme Jean Leclaire, but he visited many other social visionaries who provided information and inspiration. Compiling the best ideas from these examples, Nelson founded Leclaire to, in his words, "give work, promote intelligence, provide recreation, foster beauty, and make homes." These were all factors he determined necessary for men to lead fulfilling lives. Later writers used these words to formulate Leclaire's founding principles: Work, Homes, Education, Recreation, and Beauty, but with the additional important principle of Freedom.<br/><br/>Work<br/><br/>Work could be considered the most important of these factors since without the factory jobs in Leclaire, there would be no village. The brick factory buildings were designed by architect E. A. Cameron to provide natural light, ventilation in the summer, and heated floors in the winter. There was a fire suppression system and, although industrial accidents were not eliminated, every effort was made to guarantee the safety of the workers. The ivy-covered brick buildings were surrounded by well-manicured lawns and flower gardens giving the complex a campus-like appearance. In 1894, New York World reporter Nellie Bly called the buildings "the ideal perfection of buildings for man to labor in".<br/><br/>The manufacturing complex of the N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company in Leclaire<br/>From Friends of Leclaire<br/><br/>Nelson company policies were designed to protect the financial stability of employees. Workers could earn a share of the profits and have a voice in the company if they chose that option. The profit-sharing plan gave Nelson employees a pride of ownership that resulted in a supportive workforce. There were a few short-lived labor strikes over the years, but for the most part, labor problems were rare. Workers also had reasonable hours and competitive wages. There was a provident fund that provided for pensions and sick leave, as well as widow pensions if a worker died, whether or not the death was related to his employment.<br/><br/>Company headquarters for the N. O. Nelson Company (NONCO) remained in St. Louis, but all of the N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company was moved to Leclaire. The manufacturing company was divided into shops that made a variety of products. In 1900, the shops became independent companies for tax purposes, but all were still owned by the N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company. The shops included the Cabinet Mill where wood products from cabinetry to millwork were produced. The skilled craftsmen that worked here also fulfilled special contracts, including teller cages for a local bank and an altar still in use at St. Andrew's Episcopal Church in Edwardsville. The Marble Shop specialized in architectural marble that was cut and installed by Nelson crews in homes, businesses, and even state capitols throughout the Midwest. The Machine Shop, which became Bignall and Keeler, made pipe fitting machines, pumps, gauges, and various mechanical tools expected in the plumbing trade. They also branched out to manufacture specialty items like the Leclaire Bicycle in the mid-1890s. The Brass Shop included a foundry where various plumbing pipes and tools were manufactured. These examples represent just some of the work done in the Leclaire factories. The company's logo was a stylized "NONCO" that can still be seen on plumbing fixtures and some fire hydrants in Edwardsville today.<br/><br/>Homes<br/><br/>Before homes could be built, housing was needed for workers who were completing the factory buildings as well as building homes. To meet those needs, the company built the "Club House," a large building that served many purposes. In addition to lodging, it was the community's first educational building, and it contained a well-stocked library.<br/><br/>Construction of the residential portion of Leclaire began immediately after the village was founded in June of 1890. Julius Pitzman, the innovative landscape architect who laid out the first lots in Leclaire, set them up with a number of protective covenants. The covenants provided for wide, curvilinear streets, large lots, and a deed restriction that limited the properties to residential or educational purposes only. The company paved the streets, provided electric street lights, installed sidewalks, and planted hundreds of trees along the streets of Leclaire. Later sections of Leclaire were laid out with a conventional grid design and smaller lots, but still included the deed restrictions.<br/><br/>A Leclaire Victorian cottage in 1907<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Initially the homes were built by the company and then sold at near cost to Nelson employees to encourage home ownership. If a worker became ill and could not make his mortgage, payments were suspended until after he returned to work. The homes were offered in a variety of house designs and the company advertised that no two dwellings were alike. The earliest homes were primarily Victorian cottages that came with electricity and running water. These were followed by bungalows, foursquares, and even some kit homes. Residents could purchase a company-built home or buy an empty lot and build a house themselves, provided the architectural design met company standards.<br/><br/>In later years, lots were sold to investors, usually Edwardsville residents, and many homes in the 1920s were built by local contractors who then sold them to area residents.<br/><br/>Education<br/><br/>Nelson believed in education for everyone, including the working class. Educational programming began with a kindergarten at the Club House in 1892 and continued in the new educational building at 722 Holyoake Road. Commonly called the "School House," this building provided a large hall for meetings and programs, but had moveable partitions to divide it into classroom space during the day. In the evenings, there were dances, meetings, or programs of the Leclaire Self-Culture Club which featured weekly lectures by Washington University professors or nationally known speakers who, like N. O. Nelson, were part of the social betterment movement at the turn of the century. These included Jane Addams, Edward Everett Hale, Samuel "Golden Rule" Jones, and author Charlotte Perkins Gilman, among others.<br/><br/>Children enrolled in the Leclaire kindergarten in 1913<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>In the ten years following the 1895 construction of the education building, there were a series of educational experiments including an industrial school, college, night school, and an academy. The earliest and longest-lived endeavor was the morning kindergarten, founded in 1892, that used the Fröbel Model. This two-year program was free to everyone, including Edwardsville children, until 1931 when for financial reasons the company began charging tuition to students who were not the children of employees. Nelson Manufacturing operated a kindergarten until 1934 when the building was turned over to the Edwardsville School District for a nominal fee.<br/><br/>Recreation<br/><br/>Boaters on Leclaire Lake in 1915<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Recreation was an important feature of Leclaire. The company provided sports facilities for baseball, tennis, and later, football. A bowling and billiard hall was constructed and there was a lake for boating, swimming, fishing, or ice skating in winter. Leclaire Park was furnished with boathouses, male & female bath houses, and a large pavilion. Residents organized dances, hayrides, spelling bees, and other activities, and the company sponsored a band that played regularly at entertainments in the village or in Edwardsville. Like the educational functions at the Club House and School House, the recreational facilities at Leclaire were open to all and were often a destination for Edwardsville and even St. Louis visitors.<br/><br/>Beauty<br/><br/>Early photograph of Leclaire Lake<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>The last of the factors Nelson deemed important for a satisfying life concerned the environment. Nelson knew about the importance of healthy living. He valued the beauty and cleanliness that could be found in the country, and encouraged all in Leclaire to beautify their property by planting gardens and orchards. Nelson himself led by example, so a company greenhouse provided free flowers and competitions were held for the most beautiful yards. Leclaire was laid out so that the entire village had a park-like setting still evident today.<br/><br/>Freedom<br/><br/>The Leclaire Cooperative store<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Nelson listed five founding principles for Leclaire, but modern writers add a sixth: Freedom. All of the programs offered by the company were available to employees as well as local residents, but none were mandatory. The freedom to choose whether or not to participate in company programs was entirely up to the individual. Residents of Leclaire could work for Nelson Manufacturing or elsewhere, and workers were under no obligation to live in Leclaire. Participation in recreational and educational programs was also optional. There was also a company store where employees could shop, but unlike other company towns, no one was in debt to the company store. The Leclaire Store was a cooperative where members were charged fair market prices, but were then paid quarterly dividends.<br/><br/>A Different Company Town<br/><br/>All of these benefits made Leclaire unique from other company towns. But there were also individual instances where the company showed compassion and care for the employees. The company closed the factories and hired excursion trains to take workers and their families to St. Louis for a day at the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair. When money was tight, Nelson would occasionally place extra cash in each pay envelope to make life easier for workers, and if he instituted a program the men did not agree with, they talked it out and, as often as not, Nelson would reverse himself.<br/><br/>Born in Lillesand, Norway, in 1841, N. O. Nelson was a complicated man. He was a capitalist who believed in free enterprise, but also a socialist, a follower of the "Golden Rule", and a patriot who served for the Union in the Civil War. By 1900, he was a multimillionaire, but by the time of his death in 1922, he had given it all away for the betterment of the working class.<br/><br/>Although Leclaire was not Nelson's only social experiment, it is considered his most successful endeavor. Other major efforts for social betterment included a chain of co-operative grocery stores in New Orleans, a kindergarten for the children of black employees in his Bessemer, Alabama, factories, and a home for consumptives in Indio, California.<br/><br/>Nelson's Village of Leclaire was renowned internationally as a noteworthy and successful experiment. It was described in the New York World on numerous occasions but in particular by reporter Nellie Bly in 1894 who wrote at length about the model town where "The labor question is solved and everybody happy in a little village near St. Louis." The Los Angeles Times also regularly reported on N. O. Nelson, as did the Chicago Daily Tribune and numerous other publications.<br/><br/>In a speech at Leclaire's 15th anniversary celebration in 1915, Nelson said, "Leclaire extends to you a wide open hospitality, and bids you enjoy today the ease and comfort and beauty and inspiration which we enjoy every day." More than a century has passed since that day, but the invitation still stands. Residents and researchers are invited to learn about Leclaire's history and consider the lessons that might be learned for the betterment of future generations.<br/><br/>One of the former buildings of the manufacturing complex in 2019, which now serves as the N. O. Nelson Campus of Lewis and Clark Community College<br/>Photo by Ben Ostermeier<br/><br/>Friends of Leclaire, organized in 1990 following Leclaire's Centennial celebration, promotes the history of Leclaire through a website (historic-leclaire.org), publications, and a festival, Leclaire Parkfest, held annually on the third Sunday in October | Leclaire<br/><br/>El histórico barrio de Leclaire, una vez conocido como el "suburbio al sur" de Edwardsville, fue fundado como una comunidad cooperativa en 1890 y permaneció como un pueblo separado hasta anexado a la ciudad de Edwardsville en 1934. Periódicos y revistas de todo Estados Unidos y Europa informaron sobre el experimento Leclaire, particularmente durante los primeros 20 años de su existencia. En 1979, debido a su historia única, el antiguo pueblo fue incluido en el Registro Nacional de Lugares Históricos.<br/><br/>Leclaire fue fundada por Nelson Oliver Nelson, un fabricante de plomería de St. Louis que, durante muchos años, buscó avanzar en la difícil situación de la clase trabajadora. Nelson quería mejorar las condiciones de trabajo de sus empleados y proporcionar viviendas cerca de las fábricas para que los trabajadores y sus familias pudieran participar fácilmente en los programas recreativos y educativos ofrecidos de forma gratuita por la empresa. Antes de 1890, mientras todavía estaba en St. Louis, los negocios de fabricación y distribución de la N. O. Nelson Company comenzaron a proporcionar participación en las ganancias junto con oportunidades educativas y recreativas. El experimento cooperativo de Leclaire traería beneficios adicionales.<br/><br/>Cuando los empleados de Nelson indicaron que querían trasladarse a un lugar rural, los representantes de la compañía se acercaron a los líderes de pequeñas ciudades en varias comunidades de Missouri e Illinois cerca de su sede de St. Louis. Buscaban una propiedad adecuada para construir nuevas fábricas y un pueblo modelo. Al sur de Edwardsville encontraron una extensión de tierra de 125 acres con acceso a agua, carbón y transporte. Los empresarios locales actuaron rápidamente para ofrecer un incentivo financiero. En menos de tres semanas, la comunidad recaudó un fondo de $ 20,000 de contribuciones individuales de entre $ 1 y $ 1,000 para atraer a Nelson a elegir Edwardsville para su empresa.<br/><br/>Los líderes de la ciudad habían esperado localizar la propiedad dentro de los límites de la ciudad de Edwardsville, pero cuando ningún sitio conveniente se podría encontrar, confiaban en que la inversión de Nelson al sur de la ciudad se haría pronto una parte de Edwardsville. Aunque Nelson cumplió con todas las contingencias para la construcción y la creación de empleo en su contrato, pasarían 44 años antes de la anexión a Edwardsville. Leclaire, limitado por Madison/Brown Avenues al este, las pistas del ferrocarril al Oeste, Hadley/McKinley Avenues en el sur y Wolf Street al norte, permaneció un pueblo independiente a partir de 1890 hasta 1934. Durante ese tiempo se ganó una reputación de innovaciones en negocios, educación y planificación residencial.<br/><br/>El pueblo de Leclaire en un mapa de 1931 de Edwardsville<br/>Cortesía de Paul Jenkins<br/><br/>La decisión de Nelson de construir un pueblo no se tomó por capricho, ya que a finales de la década de 1880 era un líder internacional en los campos de la cooperación y la participación en las ganancias, intercambiando teorías sociales con otros en todo el mundo mientras expandía su negocio en St. Louis. Nombró a su pueblo experimental en honor a la parisina Edme Jean Leclaire, pero visitó a muchos otros visionarios sociales que le proporcionaron información e inspiración. Recopilando las mejores ideas de estos ejemplos, Nelson fundó Leclaire para, en sus palabras, "dar trabajo, promover la inteligencia, proporcionar recreación, fomentar la belleza y hacer hogares". Todos estos fueron factores que determinó necesarios para que los hombres llevaran vidas satisfactorias. Los escritores posteriores usaron estas palabras para formular los principios fundadores de Leclaire: Trabajo, Hogares, Educación, Recreación y Belleza, pero con el importante principio adicional de Libertad.<br/><br/>Trabajo<br/><br/>El trabajo podría considerarse el más importante de estos factores, ya que sin los trabajos de fábrica en Leclaire, no habría aldea. Los edificios de la fábrica de ladrillos fueron diseñados por el arquitecto E. A. Cameron para proporcionar luz natural, ventilación en el verano y pisos con calefacción en el invierno. Había un sistema de extinción de incendios y, aunque no se eliminaron los accidentes industriales, se hizo todo lo posible para garantizar la seguridad de los trabajadores. Los edificios de ladrillo cubiertos de hiedra estaban rodeados de céspedes bien cuidados y jardines de flores que daban al complejo una apariencia de campus. En 1894, la reportera de New York World Nellie Bly llamó a los edificios "la perfección ideal de edificios para que el hombre trabaje".<br/><br/>El complejo de fabricación de N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company en Leclaire<br/>Amigos de Leclaire<br/><br/>Las políticas de la compañía Nelson fueron diseñadas para proteger la estabilidad financiera de los empleados. Los trabajadores podrían ganar una parte de las ganancias y tener una voz en la compañía si eligieran esa opción. El plan de participación en las ganancias les dio a los empleados de Nelson un orgullo de propiedad que resultó en una fuerza laboral de apoyo. Hubo algunas huelgas laborales de corta duración a lo largo de los años, pero en su mayor parte, los problemas laborales eran raros. Los trabajadores también tenían horas razonables y salarios competitivos, y había un fondo providente que preveía pensiones y bajas por enfermedad, así como pensiones de viudedad si un trabajador moría, independientemente de que la muerte estuviera o no relacionada con su empleo.<br/><br/>La sede de la compañía para la N. O. Nelson Company (NONCO) permaneció en St. Louis, pero toda la N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company se trasladó a Leclaire. La compañía de fabricación se dividió en tiendas que fabricaban una variedad de productos. En 1900, las tiendas se convirtieron en compañías independientes a efectos fiscales, pero todas todavía eran propiedad de la N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company. Las tiendas incluían el molino de gabinetes donde se producían productos de madera desde gabinetes hasta fresas. Los hábiles artesanos que trabajaron aquí también cumplieron contratos especiales, incluyendo jaulas de cajeros para un banco local y un altar todavía en uso en la Iglesia Episcopal de San Andrés en Edwardsville. The Marble Shop se especializó en mármol arquitectónico que fue cortado e instalado por equipos de Nelson en hogares, negocios e incluso capitolios estatales en todo el Medio Oeste. La tienda de máquinas, que se convirtió en Bignall y Keeler, hizo máquinas de accesorios de tubería, bombas, medidores y varias herramientas mecánicas esperadas en el comercio de plomería. También se ramificó para fabricar artículos especializados como la bicicleta Leclaire a mediados de la década de 1890. La tienda de latón incluía una fundición donde se fabricaban varias tuberías y herramientas de plomería. Estos ejemplos representan solo parte del trabajo realizado en las fábricas de Leclaire. El logotipo de la compañía era un "NONCO" estilizado que todavía se puede ver en accesorios de plomería y algunos hidrantes contra incendios en Edwardsville hoy.<br/><br/>Hogares<br/><br/>Antes de que se pudieran construir casas, se necesitaba vivienda para los trabajadores que estaban completando los edificios de la fábrica, así como la construcción de viviendas. Para satisfacer esas necesidades, la compañía construyó la "Casa Club", un gran edificio que sirvió para muchos propósitos. Además de alojamiento, fue el primer edificio educativo de la comunidad, y contenía una biblioteca bien surtida.<br/><br/>La construcción de la parte residencial de Leclaire comenzó inmediatamente después de que el pueblo fue fundado en junio de 1890. Julius Pitzman, el innovador arquitecto paisajista que presentó los primeros lotes en Leclaire, los estableció con una serie de convenios de protección. Los convenios preveían calles anchas y curvilíneas, lotes grandes y una restricción de escritura que limitaba las propiedades solo con fines residenciales o educativos. La compañía pavimentó las calles, proporcionó luces eléctricas, instaló aceras y plantó cientos de árboles a lo largo de las calles de Leclaire. Las secciones posteriores de Leclaire se diseñaron con un diseño de rejilla convencional y lotes más pequeños, pero aún incluían las restricciones de escritura.<br/><br/>Una casa victoriana Leclaire en 1907<br/>por Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Inicialmente, las casas fueron construidas por la compañía y luego vendidas a casi costo a los empleados de Nelson para alentar la propiedad de la vivienda. Si un trabajador se enfermaba y no podía hacer su hipoteca, los pagos se suspendieron hasta después de que regresara al trabajo. Las casas se ofrecían en una variedad de diseños de casas y la compañía anunciaba que no había dos viviendas iguales. Las primeras casas eran principalmente casas victorianas que venían con electricidad y agua corriente. Estos fueron seguidos por bungalows, foursquares e incluso algunas casas de kits. Los residentes podían comprar una casa construida por la compañía o comprar un lote vacío y construir una casa ellos mismos, siempre que el diseño arquitectónico cumpliera con los estándares de la compañía.<br/><br/>En años posteriores, los lotes se vendieron a inversionistas, generalmente residentes de Edwardsville, y muchas casas en la década de 1920 fueron construidas por contratistas locales que luego las vendieron a los residentes del área.<br/><br/>Educación<br/><br/>Nelson creía en la educación para todos, incluida la clase trabajadora. La programación educativa comenzó con un jardín de infantes en la Casa Club en 1892 y continuó en el nuevo edificio educativo en 722 Holyoake Road. Comúnmente llamada la "Casa Escolar", este edificio proporcionaba una gran sala para reuniones y programas, pero tenía particiones móviles para dividirlo en espacio de aula durante el día. Por las noches, había bailes, reuniones o programas del Club de la Auto-Cultura de Leclaire que presentó conferencias semanales de profesores de la universidad de Washington o altavoces conocidos a nivel nacional que, como N. O. Nelson, eran la parte del movimiento de mejoramiento social a finales del siglo. Estos incluyeron a Jane Addams, Edward Everett Hale, Samuel "Golden Rule" Jones y la autora Charlotte Perkins Gilman, entre otros.<br/><br/>Niños matriculados en el jardín de infantes Leclaire en 1913<br/>por Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>En los diez años siguientes a la construcción del edificio educativo en 1895, hubo una serie de experimentos educativos que incluyeron una escuela industrial, una universidad, una escuela nocturna y una academia. El esfuerzo más temprano y más longevo era el jardín de infantes de la mañana, fundado en 1892, que usó el Modelo de Frébel. Este programa de dos años era gratuito para todos, incluidos los niños de Edwardsville, hasta 1931 cuando, por razones financieras, la compañía comenzó a cobrar la matrícula a estudiantes que no eran hijos de empleados. Nelson Manufacturing operó un jardín de infantes hasta 1934, cuando el edificio fue entregado al Distrito Escolar de Edwardsville por una tarifa nominal.<br/><br/>Recreación<br/><br/>Barcos en el lago Leclaire en 1915<br/>por Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>La recreación era una característica importante de Leclaire. La compañía proporcionaba instalaciones deportivas para el béisbol, el tenis y, más tarde, el fútbol. Se construyó una sala de bolos y billar y había un lago para pasear en bote, nadar, pescar o patinar sobre hielo en invierno. Leclaire Park estaba amueblado con casas de botes, casas de baño masculinas y femeninas, y un gran pabellón. Los residentes organizaron bailes, paseos en heno, deletreo de abejas y otras actividades, y la compañía patrocinó una banda que tocaba regularmente en entretenimientos en el pueblo o en Edwardsville. Al igual que las funciones educativas en la Casa Club y la Casa Escolar, las instalaciones recreativas en Leclaire estaban abiertas a todos y a menudo eran un destino para los visitantes de Edwardsville e incluso de St. Louis.<br/><br/>Belleza<br/><br/>Primera fotografía del lago Leclaire<br/>por Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>El último de los factores que Nelson consideraba importantes para una vida satisfactoria se refería al medio ambiente. Nelson sabía de la importancia de una vida saludable. Valoró la belleza y la limpieza que se podía encontrar en el país, y alentó a todos en Leclaire a embellecer su propiedad plantando jardines y huertos. El propio Nelson lideró con el ejemplo, por lo que un invernadero de la compañía proporcionó flores gratuitas y se celebraron competiciones para los patios más bellos. Leclaire fue diseñado para que todo el pueblo tuviera un entorno similar al parque todavía evidente hoy en día.<br/><br/>Libertad<br/><br/>La tienda cooperativa Leclaire<br/>por Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Nelson enumeró cinco principios fundadores para Leclaire, pero los escritores modernos agregan un sexto: Libertad. Todos los programas ofrecidos por la compañía estaban disponibles para los empleados, así como para los residentes locales, pero ninguno era obligatorio. Los residentes de Leclaire podían trabajar para Nelson Manufacturing o en otro lugar, y los trabajadores no tenían la obligación de vivir en Leclaire. La participación en programas recreativos y educativos también era opcional. También había una tienda de la empresa donde los empleados podían comprar, pero a diferencia de otras ciudades de la empresa, nadie estaba en deuda con la tienda de la empresa. La tienda Leclaire era una cooperativa donde a los miembros se les cobraban precios justos de mercado, pero luego se les pagaban dividendos trimestrales.<br/><br/>Una ciudad de empresa diferente<br/><br/>Todos estos beneficios hicieron a Leclaire único de otras ciudades de la compañía. Pero también hubo casos individuales en los que la compañía mostró compasión y cuidado por los empleados. La compañía cerró las fábricas y contrató trenes de excursión para llevar a los trabajadores y sus familias a St. Louis por un día en la Feria Mundial de St. Louis de 1904. Cuando el dinero era escaso, Nelson ocasionalmente colocaba dinero extra en cada sobre de pago para facilitar la vida de los trabajadores, y si instituyeba un programa con el que los hombres no estaban de acuerdo, lo hablaban y, tan a menudo como no, Nelson se revertía.<br/><br/>Nacido en Lillesand, Noruega, en 1841, N. O. Nelson era un hombre complicado. Era un capitalista que creía en la libre empresa, pero también un socialista, un seguidor de la "Regla de Oro", y un patriota que sirvió para la Unión en la Guerra Civil. En 1900, era multimillonario, pero en el momento de su muerte en 1922, lo había entregado todo para el mejoramiento de la clase trabajadora.<br/><br/>Aunque Leclaire no fue el único experimento social de Nelson, se considera su esfuerzo más exitoso. Otros esfuerzos importantes para el mejoramiento social incluyeron una cadena de tiendas de comestibles cooperativas en Nueva Orleans, un jardín de infantes para los hijos de empleados negros en sus fábricas de Bessemer, Alabama, y un hogar para consumidores en Indio, California.<br/><br/>El pueblo de Leclaire de Nelson fue reconocido internacionalmente como un experimento notable y exitoso. Fue descrito en el New York World en numerosas ocasiones, pero en particular por la reportera Nellie Bly en 1894 que escribió extensamente sobre la ciudad modelo donde "La cuestión laboral está resuelta y todos felices en un pequeño pueblo cerca de St. Louis". Los Angeles Times también informó regularmente sobre N. O. Nelson, al igual que el Chicago Daily Tribune y numerosas otras publicaciones.<br/><br/>En un discurso en la celebración del 15o aniversario de Leclaire en 1915, Nelson dijo: "Leclaire le extiende una amplia hospitalidad abierta, y le pide que disfrute hoy de la facilidad, comodidad, belleza e inspiración que disfrutamos todos los días". Más de un siglo ha pasado desde ese día, pero la invitación sigue en pie. Residentes e investigadores están invitados a aprender sobre la historia de Leclaire y considerar las lecciones que se podrían aprender para el mejoramiento de las generaciones futuras.<br/><br/>Uno de los antiguos edificios del complejo manufacturero en 2019, que ahora sirve como el campus N.

| Author Visits via Zoom or Skype<br/><br/>I'm excited to visit with your students via Zoom or Skype! Skype is a great option for schools/classes who aren't bringing in in-person authors, but who want to explore books and poetry, connect with an author, and ask one-on-one questions.<br/><br/>Cost<br/><br/>I offer 30-45-minute Zoom or Skype visits with schools for $125 per session (or $200 for two sessions happening within three hours in the morning or the afternoon; $325 for three sessions in one day; $425 for four sessions in one day). In each session, I try to get kids as actively involved as possible. No, it's not the same kind of connection as an in-person visit offers, but it can still be inspiring and motivating for kids!<br/><br/>What I Do<br/><br/>Each session for up to 50 students includes:<br/><br/>5 minutes of tech set-up<br/><br/>3 segments of 10ish-minutes each — You choose from:<br/><br/>How I became a writer<br/><br/>Writing this particular book (you choose which book I focus on)<br/><br/>Reading (I read some poems and kids help me read others)<br/><br/>Classroom presentation (your students put on a reading or performance for me—a very appreciative audience!)<br/><br/>Writing a poem together<br/><br/>Question and answer session<br/><br/>5 minutes of wrap-ups/goodbyes<br/><br/>I also chat with classes of pre-service teachers or groups of in-service teachers about poetry and writing.<br/><br/>Tips for a Great Virtual Visit<br/><br/>Tips for a Successful Virtual Visit<br/><br/>One of my goals for virtual school visits is to capture the interactivity that makes in-person visits successful and fun. But the truth is that sometimes it's tough to be virtually interactive! The timing might not sync up correctly, which makes reading together a challenge, and it's really hard for me to hear individual students unless they come up and speak directly into the microphone/computer. But after some trial and error, I've discovered some ways to have the best virtual visits possible. Here they are: 10 ways to make my visit with your students a great experience!<br/><br/>Before the Visit<br/><br/>Get kids as excited as possible about the visit. Visit my website with them. Read some of my books with them. Gather some questions students have for me. Anything you do ahead of time to make it feel like a BIG DEAL will go a long way toward student engagement.<br/><br/>Position the video camera or laptop with webcam so that I can see as much of the audience as possible. It's hard to assess student engagement when I can only see a couple of students.<br/><br/>Limit each group to 50 students. It's incredibly hard to engage large groups via video.<br/><br/>I'll move quickly from topic to topic or poem to poem. Please remind students that they'll need to listen closely to understand what's going on.<br/><br/>Occasionally, I do a little Reader's Theater with students. If I send you any scripted student parts ahead of time, print a copy for EACH session and cut into pieces, if needed.<br/><br/>During the Visit<br/><br/>When I discuss a book, if you have that printed book, please hold it up for students to see.<br/><br/>You are my proxy. I often can't call on students and hear individual replies. So, I might say, "We're going to get 3 ideas. Raise your hand if you have an idea." Then YOU take over, call on three students, and announce those answers to everyone in the room and to me.<br/><br/>Choose confident, outgoing students for scripted student parts (if I send any ahead of time). During my in-person school visits, I try to draw out some of the less confident students, but I've found that this doesn't work as well during virtual visits because I can't hear them.<br/><br/>Have students with speaking parts sit up front. When it's time, have them stand up and remind them to speak loudly.<br/><br/>In virtual visits, behavior management falls solely on you. I often can't see exactly what's going on, so do please step in as needed. If there's a big disruption, just ask me to hold on for a moment so that I don't chatter on while nobody's paying attention:>)<br/><br/>Feel free to take pictures of me on-screen and share on social media–even though pictures of me often look ridiculous because I'm making funny faces or something while I read!<br/><br/>If you have any questions at all, please just ask, either before or during the visit!<br/><br/>Scheduling a Virtual Session<br/><br/>Are you interested in scheduling a virtual visit with me? Just email me to set up a date, and we'll go from there | Visitas de autores a través de Zoom o Skype<br/><br/>Skype es una excelente opción para las escuelas/clases que no están trayendo autores en persona, pero que desean explorar libros y poesía, conectarse con un autor y hacer preguntas individuales.<br/><br/>Coste<br/><br/>Ofrezco visitas Zoom o Skype de 30-45 minutos con las escuelas por $125 por sesión (o $200 por dos sesiones que ocurren dentro de las tres horas de la mañana o la tarde; $325 por tres sesiones en un día; $425 por cuatro sesiones en un día). En cada sesión, trato de involucrar a los niños lo más activamente posible. No, no es el mismo tipo de conexión que ofrece una visita en persona, ¡pero aún puede ser inspirador y motivador para los niños!<br/><br/>Lo que hago<br/><br/>Cada sesión para hasta 50 estudiantes incluye:<br/><br/>5 minutos de puesta a punto técnica<br/><br/>3 segmentos de 10 ish-minutos cada uno – Usted elige entre:<br/><br/>Cómo me convertí en escritor<br/><br/>Escribir este libro en particular (tú eliges en qué libro me concentro)<br/><br/>Lectura (Leo algunos poemas y los niños me ayudan a leer otros)<br/><br/>Presentación en el aula (sus alumnos ponen una lectura o actuación para mí, ¡una audiencia muy apreciada!)<br/><br/>Escribir un poema juntos<br/><br/>Sesión de preguntas y respuestas<br/><br/>5 minutos de recapitulación/adiós<br/><br/>También chateo con clases de maestros antes del servicio o grupos de maestros en servicio sobre poesía y escritura.<br/><br/>Consejos para una gran visita virtual<br/><br/>Consejos para una visita virtual exitosa<br/><br/>Uno de mis objetivos para las visitas virtuales a la escuela es capturar la interactividad que hace que las visitas en persona sean exitosas y divertidas. ¡Pero la verdad es que a veces es difícil ser virtualmente interactivo! Es posible que el tiempo no se sincronice correctamente, lo que hace que leer juntos sea un desafío, y es realmente difícil para mí escuchar a estudiantes individuales a menos que vengan y hablen directamente por el micrófono / computadora. Pero después de un poco de prueba y error, he descubierto algunas maneras de tener las mejores visitas virtuales posibles. ¡Aquí están: 10 maneras de hacer que mi visita con sus estudiantes sea una gran experiencia!<br/><br/>Antes de la visita<br/><br/>Haga que los niños se emocionen lo más posible con la visita. Visite mi sitio web con ellos. Lea algunos de mis libros con ellos. Reúna algunas preguntas que los estudiantes tienen para mí. Cualquier cosa que hagas con anticipación para que parezca una GRAN OFERTA contribuirá en gran medida al compromiso de los estudiantes.<br/><br/>Posiciona la cámara de video o el portátil con cámara web para que pueda ver la mayor cantidad de audiencia posible. Es difícil evaluar la participación de los estudiantes cuando solo puedo ver a un par de estudiantes.<br/><br/>Limite cada grupo a 50 estudiantes. Es increíblemente difícil involucrar a grupos grandes a través de video.<br/><br/>Me moveré rápidamente de un tema a otro o de un poema a un poema. Por favor, recuerde a los estudiantes que tendrán que escuchar atentamente para entender lo que está pasando.<br/><br/>De vez en cuando, hago un poco de teatro de lectura con los estudiantes. Si te envío cualquier parte del estudiante con guión antes de tiempo, imprime una copia para CADA sesión y córtala en pedazos, si es necesario.<br/><br/>Durante la visita<br/><br/>Cuando discuto un libro, si tiene ese libro impreso, por favor sostenlo para que los estudiantes lo vean.<br/><br/>Eres mi representante. A menudo no puedo llamar a los estudiantes y escuchar respuestas individuales. Así que, podría decir: "Vamos a tener 3 ideas. Levante la mano si tiene una idea". Luego USTED toma el control, llama a tres estudiantes y anuncia esas respuestas a todos en la sala y a mí.<br/><br/>Elija estudiantes seguros y extrovertidos para las partes de los estudiantes con guión (si envío alguna con anticipación). Durante mis visitas a la escuela en persona, trato de atraer a algunos de los estudiantes menos seguros, pero he descubierto que esto no funciona tan bien durante las visitas virtuales porque no puedo escucharlos.<br/><br/>Haga que los estudiantes con partes parlantes se sienten al frente. Cuando sea el momento, pídales que se pongan de pie y les recuerden que deben hablar en voz alta.<br/><br/>En las visitas virtuales, la gestión del comportamiento recae únicamente en ti. A menudo no puedo ver exactamente lo que está pasando, así que por favor intervenga según sea necesario. Si hay una gran interrupción, solo pídeme que espere un momento para que no parlotee mientras nadie está prestando atención:)<br/><br/>Siéntase libre de tomar fotos de mí en la pantalla y compartirlas en las redes sociales, a pesar de que las fotos de mí a menudo se ven ridículas porque estoy haciendo caras graciosas o algo mientras leo.<br/><br/>Si usted tiene alguna pregunta en absoluto, por favor pregunte, ya sea antes o durante la visita!<br/><br/>Programación de una sesión virtual<br/><br/>¿Estás interesado en programar una visita virtual conmigo? Solo envíame un correo electrónico para establecer una fecha, y vamos a partir de ahí |

| Storyworld Spotlight<br/><br/>25 years of Tomb Raider<br/><br/>Tomb Raider is one of the most recognizable entertainment properties in the world. Since Lara Croft's first videogame appearance in Tomb Raider (1996), her exploits as an adventurous and quick-witted explorer have resonated widely with players, earning her a place in the pantheon of great pop culture characters. For that reason we will be putting The World of Lara Croft in the Storyworld Spotlight from December 22, 2021 to March 6, 2022.<br/><br/>Crafting a Croft<br/><br/>Lara Croft was created by studio Core Design, in Derby (UK), in 1996. The studio was looking for a lead character for their upcoming a 3D adventure game for PlayStation 1. A game in a 3rd person perspective where players would see the main character in full throughout every scene.<br/><br/>As the game was about 'raiding mysterious tombs deep under pyramids,' the lead character would need to look adventurous, and have the brains to survive complex raiding missions. After some deliberation, Lara Croft was born, a young, upper-class and utterly British woman, who was as enigmatic and intelligent as she was tough and self-reliant.<br/><br/>Success and controversy<br/><br/>Tomb Raider (1996) was a breakaway success for Core Design, who quickly doubled down on building Tomb Raider 2 (1997) and 3 (1998). A big part of the success was attributed to the games' leading lady, who found admirers both with male and female players. This baffled critics who just saw Lara Croft as a sexist cartoon.<br/><br/>Explore The World of Lara Croft in Storyworld<br/><br/>This exhibition explores the successful franchise in-depth. It looks at the history of the games and why its leading lady resonates with so many people. It also dives into the mystery of what makes Tomb Raider games tick, from the deep world building to the clever puzzles and traps, and from fantastic enemy and monster designs to the character design of the legendary heroine.<br/><br/>After all, mysteries are there to explore, and have been for the past 25 years.<br/><br/>Tickets<br/><br/>Buy your tickets for Storyworld online with a start date and entry time from Wednesday December 22.

Un juego en una perspectiva en tercera persona donde los jugadores verían al personaje principal en su totalidad a lo largo de cada escena.<br/><br/>Como el juego se trataba de "raising misteriosas tumbas en las profundidades de las pirámides", el personaje principal tendría que parecer aventurero, y tener los cerebros para sobrevivir a misiones de asalto complejas. Después de algunas deliberaciones, nació Lara Croft, una mujer joven, de clase alta y completamente británica, que era tan enigmática e inteligente como dura y autosuficiente.<br/><br/>Éxito y controversia<br/><br/>Tomb Raider (1996) fue un éxito de ruptura para Core Design, que rápidamente se duplicó en la construcción de Tomb Raider 2 (1997) y 3 (1998).Una gran parte del éxito se atribuyó a la protagonista de los juegos, que encontró admiradores tanto con jugadores masculinos como femeninos.

| Real Estate Word of the Day: Option<br/><br/>Option: An agreement to keep open, for a set period, an offer to sell or lease real property. An option can be used, for example, to give the buyer time to resolve questions of financing, title, zoning and feasibility before committing the buyer to purchase. Options are frequently used in the land assemblage process. The option must be supported by its actual consideration, separate and independent of the purchase price of the property. Mere recital of consideration alone is not sufficient except in a lease-option in which the provisions of the lease are themselves sufficient consideration to support the option. An option merely creates a contractual right; it does not give the optionee any estate in the property. At the time the option is signed, the owner does not sell, nor does the buyer purchase, the property. Although the owner is obligated to sell if given notice by the buyer, the buyer is not obligated to purchase. An option to buy is also known as a call; an option to sell is known as a put. | Palabra del día: Opción<br/><br/>Opción: Un acuerdo para mantener abierta, por un período determinado, una oferta de venta o arrendamiento de bienes inmuebles. Una opción se puede utilizar, por ejemplo, para dar al comprador tiempo para resolver cuestiones de financiación, título, zonificación y viabilidad antes de comprometer al comprador a comprar. Las opciones se utilizan con frecuencia en el proceso de ensamblaje de la tierra. La opción debe estar respaldada por su consideración real, separada e independiente del precio de compra de la propiedad. El mero considerando de la consideración por sí solo no es suficiente, excepto en una opción de arrendamiento en la que las disposiciones del arrendamiento son en sí mismas una consideración suficiente para respaldar la opción. Una opción simplemente crea un derecho contractual; no le da al beneficiario de la opción ningún patrimonio en la propiedad. En el momento en que se firma la opción, el propietario no vende, ni el comprador compra, la propiedad. Aunque el propietario está obligado a vender si el comprador lo notifica, el comprador no está obligado a comprar. Una opción de compra también se conoce como una llamada; Una opción de venta se conoce como una venta. |
| Benefits of Carotenoids for the Skin<br/><br/>Have you heard of carotenoids? These powerful phytochemicals are the pigmented constituents found in plants that give flowers, fruits, and leaves their yellow, orange and red colours.<br/><br/>Since the 1930s, scientists have identified about 800 carotenoids and about 40 are found in the human body, including the outermost layer of the epidermis, the dermis and subcutaneous fat. The most common carotenoids are beta-carotene, alpha-carotene, lutein, zeaxanthin, lycopene, and astaxanthin. You can read more about astaxanthin here.<br/><br/>The content of carotenoids in the skin is influenced by numerous factors, including the intake of fruits and vegetables, their bioavailability from various foods, supplementation, exposure to UV radiation, air pollution, alcohol consumption, smoking and stress.<br/><br/>How do Carotenoids Help My Skin?<br/><br/>Carotenoids are some of the best-known antioxidants for the skin and they also have important functions as anti-inflammatory agents.<br/><br/>Healthy Aging and Skin Repair<br/><br/>Antioxidants are essential for healthy skin because they help to prevent free radical damage to cells. Free radical damage causes premature aging and the onset of various types of skin cancers. Carotenoids, along with vitamin E, vitamin C, and Co enzyme Q10 are important dermal antioxidants.<br/><br/>Due to their antioxidant activity, carotenoids support and encourage collagen and elastin production in the skin. This helps to increase the skin's density, thickness, elasticity, and firmness. Collagen and elastin decrease as we age, so getting enough carotenoids in the diet and topically is critical for aging well.<br/><br/>Carotenoids can improve the signs of photoaging, skin discolouration, elasticity, hydration, texture, and can reduce transepidermal water loss.<br/><br/>Astaxanthin in particular stimulates fibroblasts to produce collagen and elastin, inhibits the activity of the enzymes that breakdown collagen and elastin, and shows anti-inflammatory and UV-filtering effects. It has been shown to reduce melanin in the skin, which results in the decrease in the appearance of freckles and melasma.<br/><br/>Anti-acne activity: the anti-inflammatory activity of carotenoids helps to dampen the inflammation and irritation associated with acne. Carotenoids also help to normalize and balance oil secretions from the sebaceous glands. They are valuable agents in skin repair and they stimulate epidermal regeneration, helping to smooth and soften skin.<br/><br/>Where Can I Find Carotenoids?<br/><br/>There are two ways to get your daily dose of carotenoids: through diet and through topical application. The combination of both is the ideal approach to well-aging skincare.<br/><br/>Carotenoids are fat-soluble, so your body needs fat to absorb them (think tomatoes and olive oil, broccoli and butter, or spinach and avocado). Common sources of carotenoids in food are avocado, egg yolks, kale, spinach, carrots, sweet potatoes, papaya, and tomatoes.<br/><br/>While we advocate getting as many of your nutrients and antioxidants as you can from food rather than supplementation; one study showed that astaxanthin combined with collagen hydrolysate significantly improved barrier integrity, reduced transepidermal water loss, and increased the expression of procollagen type I mRNA.<br/><br/>Topical application is key to healthy skin. Studies show that high concentrations of antioxidants in human skin offer the best protection for healthy skin at any age.<br/><br/>At Sarka Botanicals, we blend carotenoid-rich, whole plants such as calendula, dandelion, and extracts like astaxanthin with cold-pressed oils and functional ingredients. Calendula alone contains over 19 different types of carotenoids. This may explain why it has such a long history of use in skin care. Studies show that carotenoids blended with co-enzyme Q10 are especially effective at reducing inflammation and slowing premature skin aging due to sun exposure. | Beneficios de los carotenoides para la piel<br/><br/>¿Has oído hablar de los carotenoides? Estos poderosos fitoquímicos son los componentes pigmentados que se encuentran en las plantas que dan flores, frutas y hojas de sus colores amarillo, naranja y rojo.<br/><br/>Desde la década de 1930, los científicos han identificado alrededor de 800 carotenoides y alrededor de 40 se encuentran en el cuerpo humano, incluyendo la capa más externa de la epidermis, la dermis y la grasa subcutánea. Los carotenoides más comunes son betacaroteno, alfacaroteno, luteína, zeaxantina, licopeno y astaxantina. Puede leer más sobre la astaxantina aquí.<br/><br/>El contenido de carotenoides en la piel está influenciado por numerosos factores, incluyendo la ingesta de frutas y verduras, su biodisponibilidad a partir de diversos alimentos, la suplementación, la exposición a la radiación UV, la contaminación del aire, el consumo de alcohol, el tabaquismo y el estrés.<br/><br/>¿Cómo ayudan los carotenoides a mi piel?<br/><br/>Los carotenoides son algunos de los antioxidantes más conocidos para la piel y también tienen funciones importantes como agentes antiinflamatorios.<br/><br/>Envejecimiento saludable y reparación de la piel<br/><br/>Los antioxidantes son esenciales para una piel sana porque ayudan a prevenir el daño de los radicales libres a las células. El daño de los radicales libres causa el envejecimiento prematuro y la aparición de varios tipos de cánceres de piel. Los carotenoides, junto con la vitamina E, la vitamina C y la enzima Co Q10 son importantes antioxidantes dérmicos.<br/><br/>Debido a su actividad antioxidante, los carotenoides apoyan y estimulan la producción de colágeno y elastina en la piel, lo que ayuda a aumentar la densidad, el grosor, la elasticidad y la firmeza de la piel. El colágeno y la elastina disminuyen a medida que envejecemos, por lo que obtener suficientes carotenoides en la dieta y tópicamente es fundamental para envejecer bien.<br/><br/>Los carotenoides pueden mejorar los signos de fotoenvejecimiento, decoloración de la piel, elasticidad, hidratación, textura y pueden reducir la pérdida de agua transepidérmica.<br/><br/>La astaxantina en particular estimula los fibroblastos para producir colágeno y elastina, inhibe la actividad de las enzimas que descomponen el colágeno y la elastina, y muestra efectos antiinflamatorios y de filtración UV. Se ha demostrado que reduce la melanina en la piel, lo que resulta en la disminución de la aparición de pecas y melasma.<br/><br/>Actividad antiacné: la actividad antiinflamatoria de los carotenoides ayuda a amortiguar la inflamación y la irritación asociadas con el acné. Los carotenoides también ayudan a normalizar y equilibrar las secreciones de aceite de las glándulas sebáceas. Son agentes valiosos en la reparación de la piel y estimulan la regeneración epidérmica, ayudando a suavizar y suavizar la piel.<br/><br/>¿Dónde puedo encontrar carotenoides?<br/><br/>Hay dos maneras de obtener su dosis diaria de carotenoides: a través de la dieta y a través de la aplicación tópica. La combinación de ambos es el enfoque ideal para el cuidado de la piel que envejece bien.<br/><br/>Los carotenoides son solubles en grasa, por lo que su cuerpo necesita grasa para absorberlos (como los tomates y el aceite de oliva, el brócoli y la mantequilla, o las espinacas y el aguacate). Las fuentes comunes de carotenoides en los alimentos son el aguacate, las yemas de huevo, la col rizada, las espinacas, las zanahorias, las batatas, la papaya y los tomates.<br/><br/>Si bien abogamos por obtener tantos nutrientes y antioxidantes como pueda de los alimentos en lugar de la suplementación; un estudio mostró que la astaxantina combinada con el hidrolizado de colágeno mejoró significativamente la integridad de la barrera, redujo la pérdida de agua transepidérmica y aumentó la expresión del ARNm de procolágeno tipo I.<br/><br/>La aplicación tópica es clave para una piel sana. Los estudios demuestran que las altas concentraciones de antioxidantes en la piel humana ofrecen la mejor protección para una piel sana a cualquier edad.<br/><br/>En Sarka Botanicals, mezclamos plantas enteras ricas en carotenoides como la caléndula, el diente de león y extractos como la astaxantina con aceites prensados en frío e ingredientes funcionales. Solo la caléndula contiene más de 19 tipos diferentes de carotenoides. Los estudios demuestran que los carotenoides mezclados con la coenzima Q10 son especialmente efectivos para reducir la inflamación y retrasar el envejecimiento prematuro de la piel debido a la exposición al sol. |
