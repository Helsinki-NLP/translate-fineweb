Undocumented migrants have nothing. They are not allowed to work. They have no right to state benefits nor to a place to live. They are unseen and potentially the most vulnerable group in the UK today.<br/><br/>Undocumented (or irregular) migrants include those trafficked into the sex trade or for domestic servitude; they include visa overstayers; those whose asylum applications have been refused and others who have been subject to failures in the immigration system. All of these may originally have come to the UK legally.<br/><br/>'Illegal immigrants' – those imagined to have entered the country in the backs of lorries – make up a small proportion of the undocumented.<br/><br/>Indeed some sources suggest that half the estimated 120,000 undocumented children in the UK were actually born here to undocumented parents. These children are disadvantaged from birth, solely by their immigration status.<br/><br/>The blog tells the stories of the undocumented. It highlights their daily struggles and vulnerabilities, but also their strength and resilience. It's not an easy read.<br/><br/>You can access the blog via our website (bottom of right hand column on Home Page).<br/><br/>The blog has won the online category of the Speaking Together media awards. The awards were a new addition this year to the Migrant and Refugee Woman of the Year Awards celebration at the Royal Festival Hall in London as part of International Women's Day. The panel of judges – including novelist and playwright Gillian Slovo, and journalist and author, Hannah Pool – was particularly looking for work that challenged myths and stereotypes.<br/><br/>The blog has also won the Blog North Awards 2013 in the Best Writing category and was also shortlisted for an Amnesty International Media Award. | Navegación de entradas<br/><br/>"La vida sin papeles" gana el premio a la mejor escritura<br/><br/>El proyecto del blog, "Vida sin papeles", creado por Len Grant, presenta historias de familias y jóvenes migrantes indocumentados. Los migrantes indocumentados no tienen nada. No se les permite trabajar. No tienen derecho a beneficios estatales ni a un lugar para vivir. Son invisibles y potencialmente el grupo más vulnerable en el Reino Unido hoy en día.<br/><br/>Los migrantes indocumentados (o irregulares) incluyen a aquellos traficados en el comercio sexual o por servidumbre doméstica; incluyen a los que se quedan más tiempo; aquellos cuyas solicitudes de asilo han sido rechazadas y otros que han sido objeto de fallas en el sistema de inmigración. Todos estos pueden haber llegado originalmente al Reino Unido legalmente.<br/><br/>Los "inmigrantes ilegales" -aquellos que se imaginan que entraron al país en camiones- representan una pequeña proporción de los indocumentados.<br/><br/>De hecho, algunas fuentes sugieren que la mitad de los aproximadamente 120.000 niños indocumentados en el Reino Unido en realidad nacieron aquí de padres indocumentados. Estos niños están en desventaja desde el nacimiento, únicamente por su estatus migratorio.<br/><br/>El blog cuenta las historias de los indocumentados. Destaca sus luchas y vulnerabilidades diarias, pero también su fuerza y resistencia. No es una lectura fácil.<br/><br/>Puede acceder al blog a través de nuestro sitio web (columna inferior derecha en la página de inicio).<br/><br/>El blog ha ganado la categoría en línea de los premios Speaking Together.

| Sabbath School Lesson<br/><br/>In Galatians, Paul tackles issues such as freedom, the role of the law in salvation, our condition in Christ, and the nature of the Spirit-led life, as well as the age-old question, How can sinful humans be made right before a holy and just God?<br/><br/>Many scholars believe that Galatians may be the earliest of Paul's letters. It was written in A.D. 49, shortly after the famous Jerusalem Council (Acts 15). Therefore, the book may be the oldest Christian document known. As Acts and Galatians make clear, the early church found itself in a fierce battle over the nature of salvation, especially in the case of Gentiles. According to a group of Jewish believers, known as Judaizers, belief in Jesus alone was not good enough for Gentiles. Gentiles must also be circumcised and follow the laws of Moses (Acts 15:1).<br/><br/>This quarter's Bible study guide invites us to journey with the apostle Paul as he pleads with the Galatians to remain true to Jesus. It also gives us a chance to reflect on our own understanding of the truths that opened the way for Martin Luther's ultimate break with Rome and the restoration of the biblical gospel. | Lección de Escuela Sabática<br/><br/>En Gálatas, Pablo aborda temas como la libertad, el papel de la ley en la salvación, nuestra condición en Cristo y la naturaleza de la vida dirigida por el Espíritu, así como la pregunta secular: ¿Cómo pueden los seres humanos pecadores ser hechos justos ante un Dios santo y justo?<br/><br/>Muchos eruditos creen que Gálatas puede ser la primera de las cartas de Pablo. Fue escrito en el año 49 d.C., poco después del famoso Concilio de Jerusalén (Hechos 15). Por lo tanto, el libro puede ser el documento cristiano más antiguo conocido. Como Hechos y Gálatas dejan claro, la iglesia primitiva se encontró en una feroz batalla sobre la naturaleza de la salvación, especialmente en el caso de los gentiles. Según un grupo de creyentes judíos, conocidos como judaizantes, la creencia en Jesús solo no era lo suficientemente buena para los gentiles. Los gentiles también deben ser circuncidados y seguir las leyes de Moisés (Hechos 15:1).<br/><br/>La guía de estudio bíblico de este trimestre nos invita a caminar con el apóstol Pablo mientras suplica a los Gálatas que permanezcan fieles a Jesús. También nos da la oportunidad de reflexionar sobre nuestra propia comprensión de las verdades que abrieron el camino para la ruptura final de Martín Lutero con Roma y la restauración del evangelio bíblico. |

Cuando Charlotte tenía doce años, su madre murió y fue criada por su hermana de la madre, Charlotte, que se casó con su padre en 1784 y sus hermanas fueron traídas por su abuela, Maria Louise Albertine de Leiningen-Falkenburg-Dagsburg en Darmstadt. El 3 de septiembre de 1785, a la edad de quince años, Charlotte se casó con el duque Federico, duque de Sajonia-Altenburg, el matrimonio no era feliz, Charlotte era mentalmente superior a Federico, que comenzó a ignorarla. También tenían problemas, Saxe-Hildburghausen había sido financieramente arruinado por las políticas desastrosas de los predecesores de Frederick. Los receptores le permitieron al duque y a la duquesa solo una lista civil reducida, el padre de Charlotte y dos hermanos a menudo se quedaban con Charlotte en Hildburghausen. En 1787, se mudó a Hildburghausen permanentemente y se convirtió en presidenta del comité de crédito. En 1792, la abuela de Charlotte y sus hermanas huyeron antes de que el ejército francés avanzara de Darmstadt a Hildburghausen y su abuela notó al marido de Charlotte.De todos sus deberes, cumple sus deberes matrimoniales con celo.

En 1803 y 1805, la pareja real prusiana visitó Hildburghausen, para esta ocasión, los receptores permitieron que la pareja ducal renovara algunos de sus muebles.

Muchos espectadores habían venido a ver a la princesa heredera bávara, al recibir a sus invitados, Truchsee trató de llevar a la Charlotte de menor rango primero a su castillo, pero ella se negó, refiriéndose a su hija. Truchsee respondió: "Su Alteza me perdonará, pero mientras este castillo ha estado aquí, Teresa tomó el otro brazo de los barones, y los tres caminaron juntos por la puerta".<br/><br/>1617.<br/>Príncipe Carlos de Hesse-Kassel<br/>–<br/>El príncipe Charles de Hesse-Kassel era un cadete miembro de la casa de Hesse-Kassel y un mariscal de campo general danés.

El abuelo, Guillermo VIII, Landgrave de Hesse, concedió el condado de Hanau y sus ingresos a Mary, el príncipe joven Charles y sus dos hermanos, Guillermo y Frederick, fueron criados por su madre y criados por parientes protestantes desde 1747. En 1756, María se trasladó a Dinamarca, para cuidar de los hijos menores de edad de su hermana, la reina Luisa de Dinamarca, y con ella se llevó a sus hijos que fueron criados en la corte del Palacio de Christiansborg en Copenhague.

En cumplimiento de las órdenes de Henry, repudió y se divorció de su duquesa, Ethelinde, y este evento tuvo lugar en Goslar en 1070, cuando los Estados de Baviera se sometieron silenciosamente al duque recién hecho, que era el representante de una de las familias más antiguas de la provincia. Su repudio a la duquesa, que podría haber considerado un acto de injusticia. Papa y emperador fueron reconciliados superficialmente en 1076, pero el año los vio nuevamente involucrados en hostilidades activas. Enrique, a consecuencia de repetidos actos de rebelión, declaró a Welf depuesto en su recién adquirido ducado. Sin embargo, apoyado por sus bávaros fieles y ayudado por su padre en Italia, Welf era capaz de mantener su lugar, sin embargo, Gregory murió en 1.085 y sus sucesores tomaron una parte menos intensiva en los asuntos de Alemania. Welf, aunque todavía adhiriéndose al partido de la iglesia, después del divorcio, en 1070, de su primera esposa, Welf se casó con Judith de Flandes, la hija de Balduino IV, el Conde de Flandes, y la viuda de Tostig Godwinson, el Conde de Northumbria. En 1089, Welf hijo de Welf se casó con Matilde de Toscana, fortaleciendo así las relaciones con el Papa, sin embargo, después de que el joven Welf se divorciara de Matilde en 1095, Welf hizo las paces con el rey Enrique IV y fue reconfirmado en su posición como duque de Baviera. Después de la muerte de su padre Azzo en 1097, Welf trató de adquirir la propiedad de su padre al sur de los Alpes, en 1099, Welf se unió a lo que se conocería como la Cruzada de 1101, junto con Guillermo IX de Aquitania, Hugo de Vermandois e Ida de Austria. Su éxito principal era prevenir un choque entre cruzados del mismo tipo, que habían estado saqueando el territorio Bizantino en su camino a Constantinople, propio Welf escapó del fiasco, pero murió en su camino atrás en Paphos, Chipre en 1101 y se sepultó en la Abadía Weingarten.

| Follow Us<br/><br/>ARE YOU AN<br/><br/>INSIDER<br/><br/>Craving Sugar? Here's What Your Body Is Trying to Tell You<br/><br/>by<br/>Byrdie<br/><br/>PHOTO:<br/><br/>Jacquemus<br/><br/>Weight gain from out-of-control cravings aside, it can be frustrating to have a constant hankering for something unhealthy and not know why. The good news is that there's usually a reason underlying that burning desire to house a bag of potato chips, or the feeling that you might actually die if you don't get a pickle rightthisinstant (even though you're not pregnant). If you're having visions of Milky Way bars, for example, it could mean that you're missing a very specific nutrient in your diet. (Yup—it's more complicated than said chocolate bar being so darn delicious.)<br/><br/>We talked to Los Angeles–based dietitian Shira Lenchewski, M.S., R.D., to get the skinny on some common food cravings, as well as what you can do to satiate the hunger without going overboard. Keep scrolling for some seriously good information!<br/><br/>If you're craving chocolate<br/><br/>It means: You could be lacking magnesium in your diet, says Lenchewski. "Magnesium is an essential mineral involved in energy production, glucose metabolism, and muscle function. This is especially true for those hitting the gym hard," she explains. Additionally, magnesium levels lower during the pre-menstrual weeks of your period, which explains why PMS so often comes with chocolate cravings.<br/><br/>Instead, reach for high-quality, low-sugar dark chocolate, which is naturally high in magnesium. "I recommend sticking to 75 per cent cocoa or higher, and pairing it with another magnesium-rich source like sunflower seeds," says Lenchewski. She suggests the chocolate brand Hu, a small-batch food company that focuses on high-quality ingredients produced locally. "It's a little pricey, but all the more reason to keep portions in check," she says. "It's my personal favourite." We're also big fans of superfood-packed Zenbunni.<br/><br/>If you're craving candy<br/><br/>It means: "Craving pure sugar is a good indication that you're running low on energy," says Lenchewski. "Think about it. What is the one thing you're itching for after a terrible night's sleep or at around 4 p.m. during a stressful workday? The answer is usually sugar because it's used as instant fuel for our body's cells."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for apples with nut butter. "If you're raiding your co-workers' candy stash, I recommend a more slow-burn carbohydrate with a source of fat or protein," says Lenchewski. "Unlike simple sugar, this will fuel your cells while avoiding the post-sugar crash. Two options that make for great pick-me-ups the next time you're craving candy: a sliced apple with your choice of nut butter, or berries with 2% unsweetened Greek yoghurt." We like quashing a sweet tooth with these addictive coconut chips, too—they're filling, free of any added sugar, and just so good.<br/><br/>If you're craving salt<br/><br/>It means: "If nothing but the saltiest pickle will do, you may not be drinking enough H2O," says Lenchewski. "Salt helps the body hold on to water, so we crave it when we're in need of fluids."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for water. "Stay hydrated, especially as we approach the summer months," she says. The next time a craving hits, try quenching it (literally) with a few refreshing glasses and you might find the urgency to sodium binge disappears. "If plain water bores you, try adding in mint, lemon, or frozen fruit to mix it up," says Lenchewski. And if that still doesn't do the trick, there's a healthier alternative to bagged chips or fries. "If you're really just craving salt after all, toasted seaweed is a great low-calorie option," she says.<br/><br/>If you're craving starchy carbs like pasta<br/><br/>It means: "Because high-carb foods boost the feel-good hormone serotonin, starch cravings can be a sign you're in need of a mood booster," says Lenchewski.<br/><br/>Instead, reach for a bath! "Bust out the Epsom salts, because it's time for some serious R+R," says Lenchewski. "Trust me. Indulging in a starch free-for-all feels really good in the moment, but it will likely bum you out more the next day." (As anyone who has ever over-indulged a pizza or pasta craving knows.) So the next time you want to dive head first into a bowl of carbs, draw a bath, light a candle, and treat yourself without any regret or dense calories.<br/><br/>If you're craving ice cream<br/><br/>5 / 6<br/><br/>It means: "Your body may be telling you it's in need of some healthy fat."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for coconut ice cream. "I'm a realist, so if you're craving ice cream, I'm not going to recommend a handful of walnuts, which are, of course, full of healthy fat," says Lenchewski. "For ice cream emergencies, I recommend lower-in-sugar coconut ice-creams like Coconut Bliss or Kippy's three-ingredient ice cream in Los Angeles." We can vouch for the fact that coconut ice cream tastes incredible and just like the real thing.<br/><br/>If you're craving a burger<br/><br/>It means: You need iron. "If you can't stop thinking about red meat, there's a chance your body is craving iron, b12 and folic acid," says Lenchewski. "This is especially true during or around that time of the month."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for a healthier burger. "I'm a proponent of grass fed, antibiotic and hormone-free red meat once a week," says Lenchewski. "Try experimenting with an open-faced bison burger—which, cut for cut, is leaner and has more iron than beef." Don't eat meat? Try to incorporate some kind of plant-based iron supplement into your routine, like spirulina. | Síguenos en Facebook<br/><br/>¿ES USTED UN<br/><br/>INSIDER<br/><br/>¿Anhelando azúcar? Esto es lo que tu cuerpo está tratando de decirte<br/><br/>por<br/>Byrdie<br/><br/>FOTO:<br/><br/>Jacquemus<br/><br/>Aparte del aumento de peso de los antojos fuera de control, puede ser frustrante tener un anhelo constante de algo poco saludable y no saber por qué. La buena noticia es que por lo general hay una razón subyacente a ese deseo ardiente de albergar una bolsa de papas fritas, o la sensación de que en realidad podría morir si no recibes un pepinillo de inmediato (a pesar de que no estás embarazada). Si tiene visiones de barras de la Vía Láctea, por ejemplo, podría significar que le falta un nutriente muy específico en su dieta (sí, es más complicado que dicha barra de chocolate sea tan deliciosa).<br/><br/>Hablamos con la dietista con sede en Los Ángeles Shira Lenchewski, M.S., R.D., para obtener información sobre algunos antojos de alimentos comunes, así como sobre lo que puede hacer para saciar el hambre sin exagerar. ¡Siga desplazándose para obtener información realmente buena!<br/><br/>Si tienes ganas de chocolate<br/><br/>Esto significa que podría carecer de magnesio en su dieta, dice Lenchewski. "El magnesio es un mineral esencial involucrado en la producción de energía, el metabolismo de la glucosa y la función muscular. Esto es especialmente cierto para aquellos que van al gimnasio duro", explica. Además, los niveles de magnesio disminuyen durante las semanas premenstruales de su período, lo que explica por qué el síndrome premenstrual tan a menudo viene con antojos de chocolate.<br/><br/>En su lugar, busque chocolate negro de alta calidad y bajo en azúcar, que es naturalmente alto en magnesio. "Recomiendo pegarse al 75 por ciento de cacao o más, y combinarlo con otra fuente rica en magnesio como las semillas de girasol", dice Lenchewski. Ella sugiere la marca de chocolate Hu, una compañía de alimentos de lotes pequeños que se centra en ingredientes de alta calidad producidos localmente. "Es un poco caro, pero una razón más para mantener las porciones bajo control", dice. "Es mi favorito personal". También somos grandes fans de Zenbunni repleto de superalimentos.<br/><br/>Si tienes ganas de caramelos<br/><br/>Significa: "Craving azúcar pura es una buena indicación de que te estás quedando sin energía", dice Lenchewski. "Piénsalo. ¿Cuál es la única cosa que estás ansioso por después de una terrible noche de sueño o alrededor de las 4 p.m. durante un día de trabajo estresante? La respuesta suele ser el azúcar, ya que se utiliza como combustible instantáneo para las células de nuestro cuerpo.<br/><br/>"Si está asaltando el alijo de dulces de sus compañeros de trabajo, le recomiendo un carbohidrato de combustión más lenta con una fuente de grasa o proteína", dice Lenchewski. "A diferencia del azúcar simple, esto alimentará sus células mientras evita el choque posterior al azúcar. Dos opciones que hacen grandes pick-me-ups la próxima vez que estés deseando dulces: una manzana en rodajas con su elección de mantequilla de nuez, o bayas con 2% de yogur griego sin azúcar. También nos gusta aplastar un diente dulce con estas adictivas patatas fritas de coco: se están llenando, sin azúcar agregada y tan buenas.<br/><br/>Si tienes antojo de sal<br/><br/>Significa: "Si nada más que el pepinillo más salado sirve, es posible que no esté bebiendo suficiente H2O", dice Lenchewski. "La sal ayuda al cuerpo a retener el agua, por lo que la anhelamos cuando necesitamos líquidos".<br/><br/>En su lugar, busque agua. "Manténgase hidratado, especialmente a medida que nos acercamos a los meses de verano", dice. La próxima vez que llegue un antojo, intente apagarlo (literalmente) con unos vasos refrescantes y es posible que la urgencia de los atracones de sodio desaparezca. "Si el agua pura te aburre, intenta agregar menta, limón o fruta congelada para mezclarlo", dice Lenchewski, y si eso aún no funciona, hay una alternativa más saludable a las papas fritas o papas fritas en bolsas. "Si realmente solo anhelas sal después de todo, las algas tostadas son una excelente opción baja en calorías", dice ella.<br/><br/>Si tienes antojo de carbohidratos almidonados como la pasta<br/><br/>Significa: "Debido a que los alimentos altos en carbohidratos aumentan la hormona serotonina para sentirse bien, los antojos de almidón pueden ser una señal de que necesita un refuerzo del estado de ánimo", dice Lenchewski.<br/><br/>En su lugar, busque un baño. "Saque las sales de Epsom, porque es hora de un poco de R + R serio", dice Lenchewski. "Confía en mí. Disfrutar de un almidón libre para todos se siente muy bien en el momento, pero es probable que te ahogue más al día siguiente". (Como sabe cualquiera que alguna vez haya disfrutado demasiado de una pizza o un antojo de pasta.) Así que la próxima vez que desee sumergirse de cabeza en un tazón de carbohidratos, dibuje un baño, encienda una vela y trátese sin remordimientos ni calorías densas.<br/><br/>Si tienes ganas de helado<br/><br/>5 / 6<br/><br/>Significa: "Tu cuerpo puede estar diciéndote que necesita un poco de grasa saludable".<br/><br/>"Soy realista, así que si tienes antojos de helado, no voy a recomendar un puñado de nueces, que, por supuesto, están llenas de grasa saludable", dice Lenchewski. "Para emergencias de helados, recomiendo helados de coco con bajo contenido de azúcar como Coconut Bliss o el helado de tres ingredientes de Kippy en Los Ángeles". Podemos dar fe del hecho de que el helado de coco sabe increíble y al igual que el real.<br/><br/>Si te apetece una hamburguesa<br/><br/>Significa: Necesita hierro. "Si no puede dejar de pensar en la carne roja, existe la posibilidad de que su cuerpo esté deseando hierro, vitamina B12 y ácido fólico", dice Lenchewski. "Esto es especialmente cierto durante o alrededor de esa época del mes".<br/><br/>"Soy un defensor de la carne roja alimentada con pasto, sin antibióticos y sin hormonas una vez a la semana", dice Lenchewski. "Intente experimentar con una hamburguesa de bisonte de cara abierta, que, cortada para cortar, es más delgada y tiene más hierro que la carne de res". Trate de incorporar algún tipo de suplemento de hierro a base de plantas en su rutina, como la espirulina. |

The term cyber crime is something very synonymous with conventional crime, the only difference being medium of execution. There are majorly two types of cyber crimes, the first one is in which computers are the main targets and these include cases of data damage, malicious code and even criminal data access. The second one is in which computer is only a tool using which conventional crimes are committed for eg cyber terrorism, spamming, cyber stalking and many more.<br/><br/>This is where a website consultant or a vendor comes into scene. Although not aware of all the cyber laws present till date, a website vendor can advise you on some of the most vital cyber laws while creating your site.<br/><br/>This may include common knowledge of copy rights or even protecting the content of your own website. Explaining you all the rights you posses as a website owner is also one the tasks a website vendor may do while developing your website. A vendor can also assist you by offering you information on different cyber laws to protect data. Besides all of this, a vendor can also offer you information on any new cyber law that you may not be aware of till know. Cyber laws may vary from nation to nation, one recent example can be of the cookie law released in the United Kingdom, which prevents the website from saving any user browsing data. As per the Cookie Law, websites in the United Kingdom cannot save cookie files without informational consent from the surfer.<br/><br/>It is after the implementation of such law, websites now have a pop-up window, which seeks the consent of the visitor for saving cookies files. Such files are used by websites to analyze the browsing pattern of visitors based on which advertisements are then posted on a user window. With hacking not anymore a new thing for all of us, do you think such rules and regulations can prevent online forgery or cyber crime? Technology has developed at a rapid rate but still people do not prefer shopping online due to fear of personal or bank account details getting hacked. With the rise of cyber crime, need of stringent cyber laws have also increased to curb the same and to promote a risk free shopping experience.<br/><br/>Classes of Cyber Crimes<br/><br/>Over the years there have been three major classes of cyber crimes:<br/><br/>Unauthorized access of computer system cases, which involves hacking or stealing usernames and passwords to gain access over personal information of the respective user. These kind of backdoor access are organized with the help of Trojan Horse. Releasing malicious programs like Trojan House, worms or computer viruses etc. The last class includes cyber stalking a user or online harassment .<br/><br/>Direct implications of Cyber crimes<br/><br/>Decrease in sales<br/><br/>Decrease in staff output due to network delays<br/><br/>Loss of personalized information like research work<br/><br/>Disruption in communication process<br/><br/>Indirect implications of Cyber crimes<br/><br/>Credibility issue in our financial system<br/><br/>Brand image is tarnished in the market<br/><br/>Cyber crimes affect business to business relationship in the market<br/><br/>Sense of trust in state policies and government agencies is lost<br/><br/>Preventing Cyber Crime<br/><br/>As netizens there are certain precautions that we should consider for a safe and secure online experience. Here are some of them:<br/><br/>First thing to do will be to keep personal information to your self and avoid sharing the same online.<br/><br/>Avoid sharing any photographs with online chat friends or strangers.<br/><br/>Installing latest version of anti-virus on your system can offer you a good line of defense against internet threats like viruses and malware.<br/><br/>Keeping back up of your valuable data is a good option to avoid problems like virus contamination.<br/><br/>Avoid sending credit card information to sites that are unsecured and don't have any valid certificate.<br/><br/>Installing safety programme that offers you control over site cookies and saves you from being tracked by websites.<br/><br/>Putting host-based intrusions detection devices on servers will help you keep track of irregularities on your website traffic.<br/><br/>Use of firewall is advised.<br/><br/>Why Cyber attacks are so popular?<br/><br/>Cheaper than traditional cheating methods<br/><br/>Tracking cyber crimes are not easy<br/><br/>Exact locations cannot be tracked easily<br/><br/>Absence of physical barrier in the internet world<br/><br/>Cyber crimes affect large number of people<br/><br/>Conclusion<br/><br/>The fact that human mind has unfathomable power is undeniable, which is why internet crimes are increasing at a tremendous rate. Even history has witnessed some of the greatest internet security gone kaput by the hands of hackers, who have easily got away too. The only way to curb such crime is to remain aware of the cyber laws that we have today, that can either be through internet or through website/IT vendors. Information Technology Act has to be balanced in such a way that it proves too stringent for people who are involved in cyber crimes and at the same time it should never hamper the growth of Internet industry.<br/><br/>Author Bio:– Maneet Puri at present is heading a quality web design firm located at New Delhi, India.

Por ejemplo, Ahora puede enviar información vital en todo el mundo con un solo clic del mouse, gracias a la conectividad a Internet. Lamentablemente, es esta amplia conectividad y popularidad entre las personas, Internet también ha aumentado las posibilidades de delitos informáticos. Los delitos en Internet o los delitos informáticos son ampliamente conocidos como 'Cibercrímenes'.<br/><br/>Las 'leyes cibernéticas' son algo nuevo en el sistema judicial, pero últimamente han ganado mucha atención. El término ciberdelincuencia es algo muy sinónimo de crimen convencional, la única diferencia es el medio de ejecución. Hay principalmente dos tipos de delitos cibernéticos, el primero es en el que las computadoras son los principales objetivos y estos incluyen casos de daño de datos, código malicioso e incluso acceso a datos criminales. La segunda es en la que la computadora es solo una herramienta que utiliza los delitos convencionales que se cometen, por ejemplo, el ciberterrorismo, el spamming, el ciberacoso y muchos más.<br/><br/>Aquí es donde entra en escena un consultor de sitios web o un proveedor. Aunque no conoce todas las leyes cibernéticas existentes hasta la fecha, un proveedor de sitios web puede aconsejarle sobre algunas de las leyes cibernéticas más importantes al crear su sitio.<br/><br/>Esto puede incluir el conocimiento común de los derechos de copia o incluso la protección del contenido de su propio sitio web. Explicarle todos los derechos que posee como propietario de un sitio web es también una de las tareas que un proveedor de sitios web puede hacer mientras desarrolla su sitio web. Un proveedor también puede ayudarlo ofreciéndole información sobre diferentes leyes cibernéticas para proteger los datos. Además de todo esto, un proveedor también puede brindarle información sobre cualquier nueva ley cibernética que no conozca hasta que sepa. Las leyes cibernéticas pueden variar de un país a otro, un ejemplo reciente puede ser la ley de cookies publicada en el Reino Unido, que impide que el sitio web guarde los datos de navegación del usuario. De acuerdo con la Ley de Cookies, los sitios web en el Reino Unido no pueden guardar archivos de cookies sin el consentimiento informativo del internauta.<br/><br/>Es después de la implementación de dicha ley, los sitios web ahora tienen una ventana emergente, que busca el consentimiento del visitante para guardar archivos de cookies. Dichos archivos son utilizados por los sitios web para analizar el patrón de navegación de los visitantes en función del cual los anuncios se publican en una ventana de usuario. Con la piratería ya no es algo nuevo para todos nosotros, ¿crees que tales reglas y regulaciones pueden prevenir la falsificación en línea o el delito cibernético? La tecnología se ha desarrollado a un ritmo rápido, pero aún así la gente no prefiere comprar en línea debido al temor a que los detalles personales o bancarios sean pirateados. Con el aumento de la delincuencia cibernética, la necesidad de leyes cibernéticas estrictas también ha aumentado para frenar la misma y promover una experiencia de compra sin riesgo.<br/><br/>Clases de Crímenes Cibernéticos<br/><br/>A lo largo de los años ha habido tres clases principales de delitos cibernéticos:<br/><br/>Acceso no autorizado a casos de sistemas informáticos, que implica piratear o robar nombres de usuario y contraseñas para obtener acceso a la información personal del usuario respectivo. Este tipo de acceso de puerta trasera se organiza con la ayuda de Trojan Horse. Liberar programas maliciosos como Trojan House, gusanos o virus informáticos, etc. La última clase incluye el acoso cibernético de un usuario o el acoso en línea.<br/><br/>Implicaciones directas de los delitos cibernéticos<br/><br/>Disminución de las ventas<br/><br/>Disminución en la producción de personal debido a retrasos en la red<br/><br/>Pérdida de información personalizada como trabajo de investigación<br/><br/>Interrupción en el proceso de comunicación<br/><br/>Implicaciones indirectas de los delitos cibernéticos<br/><br/>Problema de credibilidad en nuestro sistema financiero<br/><br/>La imagen de marca se empaña en el mercado<br/><br/>Los delitos cibernéticos afectan las relaciones de negocio a negocio en el mercado<br/><br/>Se pierde el sentido de confianza en las políticas estatales y las agencias gubernamentales<br/><br/>Prevenir el cibercrimen<br/><br/>Como cibernautas hay ciertas precauciones que debemos considerar para una experiencia en línea segura y protegida. Aquí están algunos de ellos:<br/><br/>Lo primero que debes hacer es mantener la información personal para ti y evitar compartirla en línea.<br/><br/>Evite compartir fotografías con amigos de chat en línea o extraños.<br/><br/>Instalar la última versión de antivirus en su sistema puede ofrecerle una buena línea de defensa contra amenazas de Internet como virus y malware.<br/><br/>Mantener una copia de seguridad de sus datos valiosos es una buena opción para evitar problemas como la contaminación por virus.<br/><br/>Evite enviar información de tarjeta de crédito a sitios que no están asegurados y no tienen ningún certificado válido.<br/><br/>Instalar un programa de seguridad que le ofrezca control sobre las cookies del sitio y le evite ser rastreado por los sitios web.<br/><br/>Poner dispositivos de detección de intrusiones basados en host en servidores te ayudará a realizar un seguimiento de las irregularidades en el tráfico de tu sitio web.<br/><br/>Se recomienda el uso de firewall.<br/><br/>¿Por qué los ciberataques son tan populares?<br/><br/>Más barato que los métodos tradicionales de engaño<br/><br/>Hacer un seguimiento de los delitos cibernéticos no es fácil<br/><br/>Las ubicaciones exactas no se pueden rastrear fácilmente<br/><br/>Ausencia de barrera física en el mundo de Internet<br/><br/>Los ciberdelitos afectan a un gran número de personas<br/><br/>Conclusión<br/><br/>El hecho de que la mente humana tenga un poder insondable es innegable, por lo que los crímenes en Internet están aumentando a un ritmo tremendo. Incluso la historia ha sido testigo de algunos de los mayores ataques de seguridad en Internet que han sido cometidos por hackers, que también se han escapado fácilmente. La única forma de frenar este tipo de delitos es estar al tanto de las leyes cibernéticas que tenemos hoy en día, que pueden ser a través de Internet o a través de proveedores de sitios web / TI. La Ley de Tecnología de la Información debe equilibrarse de tal manera que resulte demasiado estricta para las personas que están involucradas en delitos cibernéticos y, al mismo tiempo, nunca debe obstaculizar el crecimiento de la industria de Internet.<br/><br/>Autor Bio: Maneet Puri actualmente dirige una firma de diseño web de calidad ubicada en Nueva Delhi, India.
