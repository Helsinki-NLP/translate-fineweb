| While acknowledging that it's impossible to argue someone into loving something they hate, and vice versa, it's still often enjoyable to attempt the argument. When we talk to people whose opinions directly contradict ours, we're forced to defend our tastes, define our opinions, and analyze why we react the way we do. Which is why we have Why Don't You Like This?, in which two of our staffers will attempt to discover whether people with opposing opinions can get beyond "No, you're wrong!" and have a civil, constructive, and possibly even convincing discussion about their points of contention. Because no matter what talk radio says, there's still a middle ground between "We agree utterly" and "I'm right, and you're stupid and evil."<br/><br/>Scott: Since discussing my Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World apostasy, we've been looking for a case where I can call you out for not liking something wonderful, and we didn't have to look for long. We were sitting right next to each other during Martin Scorsese's Hugo—me, utterly enchanted by its fantastical tribute to the wonders of early silent cinema, and you, apparently resisting it at every turn. Critical consensus has been on my side: It hit the No. 9 spot on our collective Top 15 (though you listed it as your Overrated choice), has won (or placed) in various film-critic awards, and currently enjoys an 83 score on Metacritic. That doesn't mean you're wrong, of course, but the onus is on you to explain why Hugo was, in your words, "hollow and artificial," where many of us saw it as a lovely evocation of Scorsese's childhood and the medium when it was still in its infancy. And please be gentle as you rip this butterfly apart by the wings.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Tasha: I can't be gentle, Scott. Sometimes it hurts less if you rip the Band-Aid off all at once. (And even if it doesn't, who wants to walk around wearing a half-ripped-off Band-Aid? Gross.) The fact is, I found Hugo to be a wearyingly manipulative exercise in fakery, starting from its opening glide through a Paris train station, which reminded me more than anything of Robert Zemeckis' The Polar Express. Unlike Mike D'Angelo, I'm a fan of long, unbroken takes as a way of establishing a space and encouraging viewers to unconsciously hold their breaths as a camera explores an area; but when the space being explored is a slick, shiny CGI creation, and the camera floats weightlessly through it with no physical sense that either the camera or the surroundings are really there, that exploration starts to feel like watching someone else play a videogame. And the rest of the film felt similarly poreless and unreal to me, both in terms of its setting and in terms of its highly contrived, maudlin story.<br/><br/>I don't necessarily have a problem with manufactured, stylized environments in film. I loved Baz Luhrmann's equally sprawling, utterly artificial take on Paris in Moulin Rouge, for instance, but that film has a sense of its own ridiculousness, a sense of humor about how deliberately over-the-top it is. Ditto the stylization of Jean-Pierre Jeunet, particularly in Amélie. (Both Jeunet and Luhrmann felt like strong visual influences here.) I got the sense, however, that Martin Scorsese wanted me to take Hugo entirely seriously. Even though it's yet another achingly sentimental story about a plucky orphan bringing color back into the life of a grumpy old curmudgeon. And I just couldn't.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>There is nothing I enjoy more in film than being surprised. And there's nothing I resent and resist more than being overtly manipulated, being loudly told what to feel and when to feel it. A good film does this kind of thing subtly; a bad one uses crashing music cues and sweet strings—and in this case, a grubby, huge-eyed, disheveled orphan staring woefully at the camera—to demand pathos, and to tell viewers they're horrible people if they don't serve it up on demand. That said, I can deal with sad kids and grumpy adults making life better for each other—I really dug this year's Le Havre, which was essentially the same plot without all the cutesiness—but I find the artificial environments reflect badly on the artificial emotions, and each makes the other seem more fake by turns.<br/><br/>Let's start with that. In our overlooked films video, you and Noel both took Keith to task for championing Tyrannosaur, because you felt it wasn't realistic enough—too contrived, too miserablist, too much, too far. How is it possible that you can't buy a stymied old crank who breaks things when he's angry, but you can buy an orphan living inside a giant train-station clock and embarking upon a whimsical journey to repair a mysterious automaton that he believes might bear secrets from his dead father, but which instead leads him on a quirky voyage of self-discovery, into the magical land of cinema? Did you never find Hugo's gaudy rococo design, aggressive heartstring-plucking, or wheelbarrow-loads of quirk even a little excessive or hard to swallow?<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Scott: Jeunet and Luhrmann as influences on Scorsese?! Forget being indelicate, now you're deliberately poking me with a sharp stick. If you're looking for inspirations for Hugo—indeed, if you're looking for the emotional core of Hugo—you have to go back to Scorsese's childhood on Elizabeth Street in Little Italy, where an asthmatic little boy, unable to play outside with the other kids, retreated to Alexander Korda fantasies like The Thief Of Bagdad. Or, more simply, just go straight to the source himself: George Méliès, whose A Trip To The Moon remains the Big Bang of all cinematic fantasies, that moment when the camera was not used to document the world as it is, but whatever whimsical, magical, transporting place a filmmaker wants to invent for it. And that tradition has been developed and expanded upon for decades before the likes of Jeunet and Luhrmann got their grubby little paws on it.<br/><br/>And speaking of Jeunet, nice attempt to take away my rhetorical weapon, but I'll say it anyway: How can you love Amélie, yet find Hugo synthetic and "excessive" and "wearyingly manipulative"? You say that Amélie and Moulin Rouge have redeeming "sense of [their] own ridiculousness" where Scorsese means us to take Hugo seriously, and I don't think that's the case, at least on the latter point. That Scorsese feels evident passion about the movies is, I suppose, why you'd interpret Hugo as self-serious. But to me, it's those feelings that give the film an emotional ballast that the Luhrmann and Jeunet films don't have. All three films make aggressive use of the marvels of CGI—and Scorsese adds 3D to the mix, to wonderful effect—but where you and I differ is on the issue of weightlessness. I agree that CGI has a distancing effect; worlds composed entirely of digital plasticine are flexible to the point where they sometimes have no presence. You referred to Hugo in your "Overrated" entry for our Best Of Film piece as "a CGI gimcrack"—a perfect dis… for another movie.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>It's fair to say that Scorsese has built Hugo around a standard-issue, "heartstring-plucking" children's book/movie plot: Orphan misses his daddy, creates his own little fantasy world, gloms onto a new friend, convinces a crusty old fuddy-duddy to soften up and maybe adopt him. But that's just the narrative skeleton, and Scorsese provides plenty of flesh and blood. For one, you can't watch Hugo, the lonely boy, peering out from clock towers to the hustle-and-bustle of a Paris train station without thinking of Scorsese, another lonely boy, staring out of his bedroom window on Elizabeth Street. And even if you're not a big enough film nerd to make that connection, I really feel like Hugo's journey is not in finding a new father figure, but in persisting with the mechanical magic that stands as his own father's legacy. That's what film is: The persistence of vision that allows us to accept an illusory version of the world at 24 frames per second is science and magic at once. Hugo's relationship with Méliès isn't about him cozying up to a new daddy, but sharing a common enthusiasm the old man has submerged in bitterness. To me, that's a far more unique angle on a potentially shopworn premise.<br/><br/>Did you really find none of Hugo enchanting? Even the film's few detractors seem willing to admit that the sequences evoking cinema history and Méliès' studio—with Michael Stuhlbarg as the heroic film scholar!—were terrific. It felt, in the best possible way, like a heady compression of my History Of Film 101 class in college, condensing a semester's worth of clips and context into something between a montage and an animated pop-up book. And it speaks to the ingenious design of the film, which layers fact and fantasy so beautifully that it's at once a history of Méliès and the birth of cinema, and just the sort of simple, sumptuously produced cinematic wonder that Scorsese himself would have loved as a child. Thank goodness Hugo doesn't follow the Jeunet/Luhrmann model and have "a sense of its own ridiculousness." As a fantasy connoisseur yourself, wouldn't you say there's value in playing it straight and earnest and unabashed rather than winking at the audience? You may find Hugo sickly sweet, but I don't think the authenticity of its sentiment is to be denied.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Tasha: Yes, I did in fact find parts of Hugo enchanting. (Notice how I'm answering your question up front, whereas you were too busy frothing with apoplexy to address mine, though I assume that's an answer in its own right. Okay, "influence" may be overstating the case—I just meant the visual style looked very familiar. Though as Keith pointed out when you brought this up in person, Scorsese is neither opposed to drawing inspiration from other people's visuals, nor immune to it.) Primarily, I was enchanted by the parts dealing with Georges Méliès' backstory, with his love of cinema, with the work he put into his art and the joy he got out of it. There's an awful lot of beauty and fun in the staging of the underwater-court scene from Méliès' "Fairyland," and in the sequence at the end, focusing on Méliès footage. I'll grant you that Hugo's connection with Méliès over a shared love of film is a nice touch. And I do enjoy a good film about filmmaking.<br/><br/>But Hugo isn't primarily about film, in spite of the Méliès tie-ins. In addition to the themes you cite, it's also about finding your purpose, as the characters expressly, laboriously explain to each other and to us. And it's about spectacle, and big action setpieces, and chases, and happily-ever-after endings where even the angry bully and the shy older couple and fergawdsakes even the cranky dachshund all get paired off with charming love interests by the end. It's about the super-precocious Hermione Granger-type being bossy and perky and clever and praising the magical worlds encased in books. And all of this business is mighty familiar, and mighty artificial.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Yes, Scorsese is playing with archetypes. Problem is, I never felt he imbued them with anything new, fresh, or believable, in spite of his own backstory. I would have much preferred a story about a young Scorsese growing up with asthma—something small-scale and real, without vast rooms full of CGI clockwork and golden glowing dust-motes and prophetic dreams and a raging adult tyrant-guard with a heart of gold—all of that outsized, over-the-top nonsense. You keep citing Scorsese's personal background and love of film as evidence that he's really feeling what he's putting on the screen, but I don't feel his personal touch in any of this, except the moments that are expressly about film. The core emotions may be real, but that doesn't make the execution less false.<br/><br/>You say the authenticity of the emotion isn't to be denied. I don't question whether Scorsese personally felt lonely and isolated as a child, but I don't feel loneliness and isolation on the screen—I see a bunch of exaggerated signifiers (Hugo is filthy and his clothes are worn and all the adults yell at him and he regularly gets chased by a scary dog!) and big beats, with shouting and weeping and Spielbergian wonder-emoting. For me, sincerity is more convincing and more personal when it's quiet and direct; when someone's shouting his opinions at me, I assume he's either really angry, or just trying to overwhelm my senses to keep me from expressing my own opinion. Hugo was one long shout, as far as I was concerned.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Why didn't I get that sense of fakery from Amélie, you ask? Actually, I did. I'll completely acknowledge that Amélie and Moulin Rouge are both big, manipulative, artificial constructions in the exact same vein, demanding specific emotions at specific intervals, and trying to sell those emotions with heavy emoting and aggressive soundtrack prodding. Neither of them really sold me on their emotions as authentic human feeling. What I enjoyed in those two films was the construction—particularly Amélie's heady, laughable lists of random characterizing features and experiences for its cast, and Moulin Rouge's musical-magpie mashups and recontextualizations. I'm often sold on stories that do creative or ambitious things with structure, and both of those movies qualify, where Hugo is a much more linear, standard kid-quest.<br/><br/>But in the end, for me, it really does come down to a feeling that those movies are goofs, whereas Hugo is meant to be taken seriously at every treacly moment. You don't think that's true—but you're simultaneously defending its integrity in terms of its absolutely authentic, rooted-in-Scorsese's-history emotion, and telling me I'm wrong, and he doesn't mean it to be taken seriously. How do you reconcile those two statements? What about the film suggests to you that it isn't meant to be taken at face value? And is it possible this is just another Curious Case Of Benjamin Button-like situation where I find the use of kids in big-budget films to be largely sappy and melodramatic, whereas you as a dad find it bypasses your cynicism and goes straight to your family-feeling?<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Scott: Not sure I meant that Scorsese doesn't mean to be taken seriously; it's just that he's chosen a whimsical vehicle through which to express a serious love of the movies. When you say, "But Hugo isn't primarily about film, in spite of the Méliès tie-ins," I'm mystified. I grant that you find many elements of Hugo overly familiar and laborious and full of Spielbergian wonder-emoting—there's nothing I can do to argue around that perception, which other Hugo doubters share. Sometimes a film means to charm and enchant, and it doesn't for some; you've got Hugo and I've got Amélie, though I think the latter, deliberately artificial as it is, means for us to find it romantic. (Rather than, say, some horrible mechanical contraption fit for a Saw sequel.)<br/><br/>But to say Hugo isn't primarily about film? If it's not about film, then it's the most pointlessly discursive story about [whatever you think it's about] I've ever seen. The relationship between Hugo and Méliès is the heart of the movie, and at the heart of that is not just some stock connection between Plucky Orphan and Crusty Old Guy With A Heart Of Gold, but a shared affinity for engineered magic—specifically the magic of the movies. I think Scorsese and his collaborators have found a way to express their enthusiasm over the early days of cinema through a fantasy that's accessible to all ages. The archetype-filled children's tale is the merely the crust here; cinema is the pie. (Mmmm… pie.)<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>As for The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button, I don't see much of a connection, other than trying to expose me as a Benjamin Button defender as a way of damaging my credibility. (Incidentally, how are the extras on that G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra Blu-ray?) I've said to you that the sleep-deprived new dad in me was perhaps vulnerable to Benjamin Button, but I can't imagine a time when the premise of aging in reverse wouldn't move me. (Cradling the love of your life in your arms as an infant? How can you not be affected by that?) And besides, I don't see how Benjamin Button relates much to Hugo as a film concerning kids, since that's just a small segment of a story that spans a much larger trajectory.<br/><br/>So have I convinced you? Likely not. But I'm happy to learn that Hugo wasn't entirely devoid of enchantments for you. The sequences on Méliès the filmmaker are what put Hugo over for me—and in that, at least, we can share some movie love.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Tasha: Nope, I can't say you've convinced me, any more than I've convinced you. It's impossible to argue anyone into a visceral love of anything, and it really should be equally impossible to talk someone down from visceral love. Mostly, you've let me see Hugo in Scott-O-Vision, which is an interesting experience; at least now I'm mildly convinced that we didn't somehow manage to see entirely different films which both somehow had the same name and director.<br/><br/>We certainly had different experiences, though, and to my mind, focused on different aspects of the production: I still don't see the "film is marvelous" theme as the movie's single strand, so much as one among too many. "Pointlessly discursive" almost covers it, though I'd throw in "often needlessly cutesy and precious" on top of that. While you're focused on the film's tasty pie filling, I feel like that pie was covered with a pound of crystallized sugar, and I think that does make a difference, regardless of the film's core message or handful of terrific scenes. See also Benjamin Button, which I did not bring up just to chafe you—I really do think you have more of a sentimental streak than I do regarding children in cinema, especially when they're used more as symbols of vulnerability and innocence than as human characters. Hey, you know what film totally does not have cute wide-eyed moppets bringing hope to a cynical world? G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra. Maybe I will go watch those Blu-ray extras. I could use some explosion-insulin to compensate for Hugo's sweetness. | Chociaż przyznaje się, że nie można argumentować kogoś, że kocha coś, czego nienawidzi, i odwrotnie, to wciąż często przyjemne jest próbować argumentu.

Bo bez względu na to, co mówi radio, wciąż istnieje środek między "Zgadzamy się całkowicie" i "Mam rację, a ty jesteś głupi i zły".<br/><br/>Scott: Odkąd omawialiśmy moją apostazję Scotta Pilgrima vs. The World, szukaliśmy przypadku, w którym mogę cię wezwać za to, że nie lubisz czegoś wspaniałego, i nie musieliśmy długo szukać. Siedzieliśmy obok siebie podczas „Hugo” Martina Scorsese – ja, całkowicie zachwycony jego fantastycznym hołdem dla cudów wczesnego kina niemego, a wy, najwyraźniej, stawialiście mu opór na każdym kroku. Konsensus krytyczny był po mojej stronie: trafił na 9 miejsce w naszym zbiorowym Top 15 (chociaż wymieniłeś go jako Twój przecenowany wybór), wygrał (lub umieścił) w różnych nagrodach krytyków filmowych i obecnie cieszy się wynikiem 83 na Metacritic. To nie znaczy, że się mylisz, oczywiście, ale musisz wyjaśnić, dlaczego Hugo był, według twoich słów, "pusty i sztuczny", gdzie wielu z nas widziało to jako piękne przywołanie dzieciństwa Scorsese i medium, gdy był jeszcze w dzieciństwie. I proszę, bądź delikatny, gdy rozrywasz tego motyla za skrzydła.<br/><br/>Reklama<br/><br/>Tasha: Nie mogę być łagodna, Scott. Czasami boli mniej, jeśli zerwiesz Band-Aid na raz. (A nawet jeśli nie, kto chce chodzić w połowie zerwany Band-Aid? Brutalne.) Faktem jest, że uznałem Hugo za męcząco manipulujące ćwiczenie w fałszerstwie, począwszy od jego otwarcia przesuwającego się przez dworzec kolejowy w Paryżu, który bardziej niż cokolwiek innego przypominał mi Polar Express Roberta Zemeckisa. W przeciwieństwie do Mike'a D'Angelo, jestem fanem długiego, nieprzerwanego sposobu tworzenia przestrzeni i zachęcania widzów do nieświadomego wstrzymywania oddechu, gdy kamera bada obszar; ale gdy przestrzeń jest gładka, lśniąca kreacja CGI, a kamera unosi się przez nią bez wagi, bez fizycznego poczucia, że kamera lub otoczenie naprawdę tam są, że ktoś zaczyna oglądać wideo. A reszta filmu wydawała mi się równie beznadziejna i nierzeczywista, zarówno pod względem jego ustawienia, jak i jego wysoce wymyślonej, maudlinowej historii.<br/><br/>Niekoniecznie mam problem z produkowanymi, stylizowanymi środowiskami w filmie. Uwielbiałem równie rozległe, całkowicie sztuczne podejście Baza Luhrmanna do Paryża w Moulin Rouge, na przykład, ale ten film ma poczucie własnej niedorzeczności, poczucie humoru o tym, jak celowo jest over-the-top. Do stylizacji Jean-Pierre Jeunet, zwłaszcza w Amélie. (Zarówno Jeunet, jak i Luhrmann czuli się tu jak silne wpływy wizualne.) Mam jednak wrażenie, że Martin Scorsese chciał, abym potraktował Hugo całkowicie poważnie. Choć to kolejna bolesnie sentymentalna opowieść o odważnej sierocie, która wnosi kolory z powrotem do życia starego zrzędy, a ja po prostu nie mogłam.<br/><br/>Reklama<br/><br/>Nie ma nic, co bardziej podoba mi się w filmie niż bycie zaskoczonym. I nie ma nic, czego bym się bardziej chwalił i opierał niż bycie otwarcie manipulowanym, głośno mówiącym, co czuć i kiedy to czuć. Dobry film robi tego typu rzeczy subtelnie; zły używa rozbijających się sygnałów muzycznych i słodkich strun - a w tym przypadku, zgrabny, olbrzymi, rozproszony sierota patrząc żałośnie w kamerę - aby domagać się patosu i powiedzieć widzom, że są okropnymi ludźmi, jeśli nie podają go na żądanie. To powiedziawszy, mogę radzić sobie ze smutnymi dziećmi i złośliwymi dorosłymi, którzy poprawiają sobie życie - naprawdę wykopałem tegoroczny Le Havre, który był zasadniczo tym samym fabułą bez całej urody - ale uważam, że sztuczne środowiska źle odzwierciedlają sztuczne emocje, a każde z nich sprawia, że inne wydają się bardziej fałszywe.<br/><br/>Zacznijmy od tego. W naszym przeoczonym filmie, ty i Noel wzięliście Keitha do walki z Tyranozaurem, ponieważ uważaliście, że to nie jest wystarczająco realistyczne - zbyt wymyślone, zbyt nędzne, zbyt daleko, zbyt daleko. Jak to możliwe, że nie można kupić starego dziwaka, który łamie rzeczy, gdy jest zły, ale można kupić sierotę mieszkającą wewnątrz gigantycznego zegara na stacji kolejowej i wyruszającą w kapryśną podróż, aby naprawić tajemniczy automat, który wierzy, że może nieść sekrety od swojego zmarłego ojca, ale który zamiast tego prowadzi go w dziwaczną podróż odkrywania siebie, do magicznej krainy kina? Czy kiedykolwiek znalazłeś huk rokoko Hugo, agresywny string-plucking serca, lub taczki-ładunki dziwactwem nawet trochę nadmierne lub trudne do połknięcia?<br/><br/>Reklama<br/><br/>Scott: Jeunet i Luhrmann jako wpływy na Scorsese?! Zapomnij o nieostrożności, teraz celowo dźgasz mnie ostrym kijem. Jeśli szukasz inspiracji dla Hugo – w rzeczywistości, jeśli szukasz emocjonalnego rdzenia Hugo – musisz wrócić do dzieciństwa Scorsese na Elizabeth Street w Little Italy, gdzie astmatyczny mały chłopiec, niezdolny do zabawy na zewnątrz z innymi dziećmi, wycofał się do fantazji Alexandra Kordy, takich jak Złodziej z Bagdadu. Albo, prościej, po prostu idź prosto do samego źródła: George Méliès, którego Podróż na Księżyc pozostaje Wielkim Wybuchem wszystkich filmowych fantazji, tym momentem, kiedy kamera nie była używana do udokumentowania świata takim, jaki jest, ale jakimkolwiek kapryśnym, magicznym, transportowym miejscem twórca chce dla niego wymyślić. I ta tradycja została rozwinięta i rozszerzona przez dziesięciolecia, zanim takie jak Jeunet i Luhrmann dostały na nią swoje obrzydliwe małe łapki.<br/><br/>A mówiąc o Jeunecie, miła próba odebrania mi retorycznej broni, ale i tak powiem: jak można kochać Amélie, a jednak znaleźć Hugo syntetycznym i "nadmiernym" i "nudnym manipulatorem"? Mówisz, że Amélie i Moulin Rouge mają „poczucie własnej absurdalności”, gdzie Scorsese chce, żebyśmy potraktowali Hugo poważnie, a ja nie sądzę, że tak jest, przynajmniej w tym ostatnim punkcie. To, że Scorsese odczuwa oczywistą pasję do filmów, jest, jak sądzę, powodem, dla którego zinterpretowałeś Hugo jako samopoważnego, ale dla mnie, to te uczucia nadają filmowi emocjonalny balast, którego nie mają filmy Luhrmanna i Jeuneta. Wszystkie trzy filmy agresywnie wykorzystują cuda CGI – a Scorsese dodaje 3D do mixu, aby uzyskać wspaniały efekt – ale różnica między tobą a mną dotyczy kwestii nieważkości. Zgadzam się, że CGI ma efekt dystansujący; światy złożone w całości z cyfrowej plastyliny są elastyczne do tego stopnia, że czasami nie są obecne. Odniosłeś się do Hugo w swoim wpisie "Overrated" dla naszego utworu Best Of Film jako "CGI gimcrack" - doskonały dis ... dla innego filmu.<br/><br/>Reklama<br/><br/>Sprawiedliwie można powiedzieć, że Scorsese zbudował Hugo wokół standardowego wydania, "wyciągającego z serca" książkę / film dla dzieci: Sierota tęskni za swoim ojcem, tworzy swój własny mały świat fantazji, wpada na nowego przyjaciela, przekonuje starego zmiękczonego staruszka, aby go adoptował. Ale to tylko szkielet narracji, a Scorsese dostarcza mnóstwo krwi i mięsa. Po pierwsze, nie można patrzeć na Hugo, samotnego chłopca, patrzącego z wież zegarowych na zgiełk dworca kolejowego w Paryżu, nie myśląc o Scorsese, innym samotnym chłopcu, patrzącym przez okno sypialni na Elizabeth Street. I nawet jeśli nie jesteś wystarczająco dużym filmowym kujonem, aby nawiązać ten związek, naprawdę czuję, że podróż Hugo nie polega na znalezieniu nowej postaci ojca, ale na trwaniu w mechanicznej magii, która stoi jako spuścizna własnego ojca. Wytrwałość wizji, która pozwala nam zaakceptować iluzoryczną wersję świata z prędkością 24 klatek na sekundę, jest jednocześnie nauką i magią. Relacja Hugo z Mélièsem nie polega na tym, że zaprzyjaźnia się z nowym tatą, ale na tym, że dzieli wspólny entuzjazm, który starzec pogrążył w goryczy.<br/><br/>Nawet nieliczni krytycy filmu wydają się być gotowi przyznać, że sekwencje przypominające historię kina i studia Mélièsa – z Michaelem Stuhlbargiem jako bohaterskim uczonym filmowym! – były niesamowite. Czułem się, w najlepszy możliwy sposób, jak energiczna kompresja mojej klasy History Of Film 101 w college'u, skondensując semestr wartości klipów i kontekstu w coś między montażem a animowaną książką pop-up. Mówi o genialnym projekcie filmu, który tak pięknie łączy fakty i fantazje, że jest jednocześnie historią Mélièsa i narodzinami kina, i po prostu rodzajem prostego, wystawnie stworzonego kinowego cudu, który sam Scorsese pokochałby jako dziecko. Dzięki Bogu Hugo nie podąża za modelem Jeuneta/Luhrmanna i ma „poczucie własnej niedorzeczności”. Jako koneser fantasy, czy nie powiedziałbyś, że granie go prosto, poważnie i bezwstydnie ma wartość, zamiast mrugania okiem publiczności? Możesz uznać Hugo za chorego słodkiego, ale nie sądzę, że autentyczność jego uczuć powinna być zaprzeczona.<br/><br/>Reklama<br/><br/>Tasha: Tak, rzeczywiście znalazłem części Hugo zachwycające. (Zauważ, jak odpowiadam na twoje pytanie z góry, podczas gdy byłeś zbyt zajęty pianiem z apopleksją, aby zająć się moim, chociaż zakładam, że jest to odpowiedź sama w sobie. Ok, "wpływ" może być przesadzeniem sprawy - miałem na myśli styl wizualny wyglądał bardzo znajomo. Chociaż, jak zauważył Keith, gdy osobiście o tym wspomniałeś, Scorsese nie sprzeciwia się czerpaniu inspiracji z wizerunków innych ludzi, ani nie jest na to odporny.) Przede wszystkim zachwyciły mnie części dotyczące historii Georgesa Mélièsa, jego miłości do kina, pracy, którą włożył w swoją sztukę i radości, jaką z niej wydobył. Jest strasznie dużo piękna i zabawy w inscenizacji podwodnej sceny z "Fairyland" Mélièsa, aw sekwencji na końcu, koncentrując się na nagraniach Mélièsa. Przyznaję, że związek Hugo z Méliès przez wspólną miłość do filmu jest miłym akcentem, a ja lubię dobry film o filmowaniu.<br/><br/>Ale Hugo nie jest przede wszystkim o filmie, pomimo powiązań Mélièsa. Oprócz tematów, które cytujesz, chodzi również o znalezienie celu, jak bohaterowie wyraźnie, pracowicie wyjaśniają sobie i nam. Chodzi o spektakl, wielkie sceny akcji, pościgi i szczęśliwe zakończenia, gdzie nawet wściekły tyran i nieśmiała starsza para i fergawdsakes, nawet dziwaczny jamnik, do końca łączą się z uroczymi zainteresowaniami miłosnymi. Chodzi o to, że Hermiona Granger jest bardzo wcześniakiem, bystrą i sprytną, chwalącą magiczne światy zamknięte w książkach, a cała ta sprawa jest bardzo znana i sztuczna.<br/><br/>Reklama<br/><br/>Tak, Scorsese bawi się archetypami. Problem w tym, że nigdy nie czułem, że nasycił ich czymś nowym, świeżym lub wiarygodnym, pomimo własnej historii. Wolałabym opowieść o młodym Scorsese dorastającym z astmą – coś małego i prawdziwego, bez rozległych pomieszczeń pełnych zegarów CGI i złotych świecących pyłów i proroczych snów oraz wściekłego dorosłego tyrana-strażnika ze złotym sercem – wszystko to przesadne, bezsensowne bzdury. Ciągle powołujesz się na osobiste tło Scorsese i miłość do filmu jako dowód na to, że naprawdę czuje to, co umieszcza na ekranie, ale nie czuję jego osobistego dotyku w żadnym z nich, z wyjątkiem chwil, które są wyraźnie związane z filmem. Podstawowe emocje mogą być prawdziwe, ale to nie czyni egzekucji mniej fałszywej.<br/><br/>Mówisz, że autentyczności emocji nie można zaprzeczyć. Nie kwestionuję, czy Scorsese osobiście czuł się samotny i odizolowany jako dziecko, ale nie czuję samotności i izolacji na ekranie - widzę grupę przesadnych oznaczeń (Hugo jest brudny i jego ubrania są noszone, a wszyscy dorośli krzyczą na niego, a on regularnie jest ścigany przez przerażającego psa!) i duże uderzenia, z krzykiem i płaczem i Spielbergianem. Dla mnie szczerość jest bardziej przekonująca i bardziej osobista, gdy jest cicha i bezpośrednia; kiedy ktoś krzyczy na mnie swoje opinie, zakładam, że jest albo naprawdę zły, albo po prostu próbuje przytłoczyć moje zmysły, aby powstrzymać mnie od wyrażania własnej opinii. Hugo był jednym długim krzykiem, jeśli o mnie chodzi.<br/><br/>Reklama<br/><br/>Dlaczego nie dostałem tego poczucia fałszerstwa od Amélie, pytasz? Całkowicie przyznaję, że Amélie i Moulin Rouge są zarówno dużymi, manipulacyjnymi, sztucznymi konstrukcjami w tym samym duchu, wymagającymi konkretnych emocji w określonych odstępach czasu i próbującymi sprzedać te emocje z ciężkimi emocjami i agresywnym podżeganiem do ścieżki dźwiękowej. Żaden z nich tak naprawdę nie sprzedał mi swoich emocji jako autentycznych ludzkich uczuć. To, co podobało mi się w tych dwóch filmach, to konstrukcja - zwłaszcza śmieszne, śmieszne listy losowych cech i doświadczeń Amélie dla jej obsady oraz muzyczno-magpie Mashups i rekontekstualizacje Moulin Rouge. Często sprzedają mi historie, które robią kreatywne lub ambitne rzeczy o strukturze, a oba te filmy kwalifikują się, gdzie Hugo jest znacznie bardziej linearnym, standardowym kid-questem.<br/><br/>Ale w końcu, dla mnie, naprawdę sprowadza się do poczucia, że te filmy są bzdurami, podczas gdy Hugo ma być traktowany poważnie w każdej chwili. Nie sądzisz, że to prawda, ale jednocześnie bronisz jej integralności w kategoriach jej absolutnie autentycznej, zakorzenionej w historii emocji Scorsese'a i mówisz mi, że się mylę, i nie chce, aby to było traktowane poważnie. A co z tym filmem, który sugeruje, że nie ma być brany za cenę nominalną? I czy to możliwe, że to tylko kolejna ciekawa sprawa Benjamina Buttona, w której uważam, że dzieci w filmach o dużym budżecie są w dużej mierze beznadziejne i melodramatyczne, podczas gdy ty jako tata uważasz, że to omija twój cynizm i idzie prosto do twojego rodzinnego uczucia?<br/><br/>Reklama<br/><br/>Scott: Nie jestem pewien, czy miałem na myśli, że Scorsese nie chce być traktowany poważnie; po prostu wybrał kapryśny pojazd, przez który wyraża poważną miłość do filmów. Kiedy mówisz, "Ale Hugo nie jest przede wszystkim o filmie, pomimo Méliès krawatów", jestem zdumiony. Przyznaję, że wiele elementów Hugo jest zbyt znajomych i pracochłonnych i pełnych spielbergowskich cudów - nie mogę nic zrobić, aby argumentować wokół tej percepcji, którą podzielają inni wątpiący w Hugo. Czasami film oznacza urok i zaklęcie, a nie dla niektórych nie; masz Hugo i mam Amélie, chociaż myślę, że ten drugi, celowo sztuczny, oznacza dla nas, że jest romantyczny. (Zamiast, powiedzmy, jakiegoś strasznego mechanicznego wynalazku pasującego do sequela Piły.)<br/><br/>Ale powiedzieć, że Hugo nie jest przede wszystkim o filmie? Jeśli nie jest o filmie, to jest to najbardziej bezsensowna opowieść o [o czymkolwiek myślisz], jaką kiedykolwiek widziałem. Relacja między Hugo i Mélièsem jest sercem filmu, a sercem tego jest nie tylko jakieś powiązanie między Plucky Orphan i Crusty Old Guy With A Heart Of Gold, ale wspólne powinowactwo do inżynierskiej magii - w szczególności magii filmów. Myślę, że Scorsese i jego współpracownicy znaleźli sposób, aby wyrazić swój entuzjazm w pierwszych dniach kina poprzez fantazję, która jest dostępna dla wszystkich grup wiekowych. (Mmmm... pie.)<br/><br/>Reklama<br/><br/>Jeśli chodzi o The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, nie widzę związku, poza próbą ujawnienia mnie jako obrońcy Benjamina Buttona jako sposobu na uszkodzenie mojej wiarygodności. (Nawiasem mówiąc, jak wyglądają dodatki do tego G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra Blu-ray?) Mówiłam ci, że mój nowy tata pozbawiony snu był może podatny na Benjamina Buttona, ale nie wyobrażam sobie czasu, w którym założenie starzenia się w odwrotnym kierunku nie poruszyłoby mnie. (Kołysanie miłości twojego życia w ramionach jako niemowlę? A poza tym, nie widzę, jak Benjamin Button odnosi się do Hugo jako filmu o dzieciach, ponieważ jest to tylko mały odcinek historii, który rozciąga się na znacznie większą trajektorię.<br/><br/>Czy przekonałem cię? Prawdopodobnie nie. Ale cieszę się, że Hugo nie był dla ciebie całkowicie pozbawiony zaklęć. Sekwencje na Méliès, reżysera, są tym, co dla mnie przełożyło Hugo - i w tym przynajmniej możemy podzielić się miłością filmową.<br/><br/>Reklama<br/><br/>Tasha: Nie, nie mogę powiedzieć, że przekonałeś mnie, bardziej niż ja ciebie. Niemożliwe jest kłócić się z kimś o trzewiową miłość do czegokolwiek, a naprawdę powinno być równie niemożliwe odmówić komuś od trzewiowej miłości. Przede wszystkim pozwoliliście mi zobaczyć Hugo w Scott-O-Vision, co jest interesującym doświadczeniem; przynajmniej teraz jestem łagodnie przekonany, że jakoś nie udało nam się zobaczyć zupełnie innych filmów, które w jakiś sposób miały tę samą nazwę i reżysera.<br/><br/>Z pewnością mieliśmy jednak różne doświadczenia i moim zdaniem skupiliśmy się na różnych aspektach produkcji: nadal nie widzę tematu "film jest wspaniały" jako pojedynczej nici filmu, tak bardzo, jak jeden z zbyt wielu. "Niepotrzebnie dyskursywna" prawie ją pokrywa, chociaż dodałbym do tego "często niepotrzebnie urocza i cenna". Podczas gdy skupiasz się na smacznym wypełnieniu ciasta w filmie, czuję, że to ciasto było pokryte funtem skrystalizowanego cukru i myślę, że to robi różnicę, niezależnie od głównego przesłania filmu lub garści wspaniałych scen. Zobacz także Benjamin Button, o którym nie wspomniałem tylko po to, aby cię zranić – naprawdę myślę, że masz bardziej sentymentalną serię niż ja w przypadku dzieci w kinie, zwłaszcza gdy są one używane bardziej jako symbole bezbronności i niewinności niż jako ludzkie postacie. Hej, wiesz, który film nie ma uroczych, szerokich oczu małp, które przynoszą nadzieję cynicznemu światu? G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra. Może pójdę obejrzeć te dodatki Blu-ray. Mógłbym użyć trochę insuliny wybuchowej, aby zrekompensować słodkość Hugo. |
| "I hoped my daughter would be free from difficult and troubling times": Mee Mee's story as a refugee Mom<br/><br/>Hope in Times of Crisis: A Mother's Day Story<br/><br/>By Judith Santiago*<br/><br/>Mee Mee heard that the soldiers were coming. She took hold of her son and frantically joined the rest of the villagers who were running toward the Thai-Burmese border, where the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) was located. Her husband was in another village running in the opposite direction, Mee later learned. After the soldiers' pursuit ended, Mee returned home to her small village in Koechi, Burma.<br/><br/>During 1997-2000, Mee and thousands like her lived under the constant threat of violence from Burmese soldiers. Many people would take temporary refuge in the jungle, and return home to their village after soldiers left the area, just to do it all over again days later. About once a week, Mee and others would be on the move to avoid capture, rape, or death by soldiers.<br/><br/>During one incident, Mee's husband ran ahead of his wife to secure food for his family. Her husband was spotted by soldiers and shot. The bullet shattered a portion of his ribcage, leaving him severely wounded and in distress as he journeyed toward the jungle with his family for safety.<br/><br/>For three months, Mee's husband hid and moved the family with an exasperating wound at his side. He received no medical care, except for Mee's tending.<br/><br/>"I was afraid to return to Burma," Mee said through an interpreter. "I feared dying. I cried and cried every day," she continued.<br/><br/>Mee's husband eventually drew enough strength to walk five days toward a small village in Thailand where they learned the location of a hospital and a refugee camp. When Mee and her husband finally arrived at the hospital, he underwent immediate surgery and later recovered.<br/><br/>Symbol of Hope<br/><br/>Life in the jungle for those fleeing Burmese soldiers was indeed terrifying and difficult. Makeshift bamboo tents with only roof and floor coverings became suitable temporary dwellings. Many women including Mee gave birth to children in the jungle. Mee's then six-year-old son assisted in the delivery of his sister named Eh Ku Hser. Her name means love – cold – sweet. "Cold" in Burmese culture means so as to not pass through the fire of life, as heat represents troubled times.<br/><br/>"I hoped my daughter would be free from difficult and troubling times," said Mee. "I did not want her to go through what I had experienced," she continued.<br/><br/>For Mee, the birth of her daughter in the midst of darkness, torment and fear, was a symbol of hope for a new life to come. Hope in times of crisis, the very premise of the United Methodist Committee on Relief's (UMCOR) newly co-branded UMCOR-Prosperity Candle, is also the essence of that which candles shed light upon.<br/><br/>A New Beginning<br/><br/>With the help of UNHCR, hope for a new life did indeed materialize for Mee and her family when they resettled in West Springfield, Massachusetts. There, Mee met Moo Kho Paw, another woman who emigrated from Burma, and who was working at Prosperity Candle in Florence. The organization helps refugee women who have escaped areas of conflict rebuild their lives through the art of candle making. Moo Kho recommended that Mee join the organization, and Mee gladly accepted.<br/><br/>"I was excited to be out of the house," said Mee, "I was raised to believe that because I was a woman, my role was to remain at home and raise my family," she continued. "While many Burmese women want to do more for themselves, they are often encouraged to remain homemakers."<br/><br/>Today, Mee has plans to go into the candle-making business for herself and support her five children, but she expressed the need to learn English first.<br/><br/>"In the Thai refugee camp, we had education, but it was not so good," said Mee. "When I was a child, I wanted to go to school, but I was told to stay home because I was a woman. Now, I have hopes for my daughters to go to college and become doctors or policewomen," continued Mee.<br/><br/>Mee has struck an even balance in her life that she wishes others would have found—a simple, happy life where work, caring for family members and freedom of choice all have their place.<br/><br/>Support Refugee Women in the US<br/><br/>Share this Mother's Day story with your loved ones. And, when you purchase handmade candles by Mee, Moo Kho, and Naw, another Burmese refugee woman working at Prosperity Candle , know you are helping to support their livelihood as they rebuild their lives and those of their family members in the US. | "Małam nadzieję, że moja córka będzie wolna od trudnych i niepokojących czasów": historia Mee Mee jako uchodźczyni<br/><br/>Nadzieja w czasach kryzysu: Opowieść o Dniu Matki<br/><br/>Przez Judith Santiago*<br/><br/>Mee Mee usłyszała, że żołnierze nadchodzą. Wzięła syna i gorączkowo dołączyła do reszty mieszkańców wioski, którzy biegli w kierunku granicy tajsko-birmańskiej, gdzie znajdowało się Biuro Wysokiego Komisarza Narodów Zjednoczonych ds. Uchodźców (UNHCR). Jej mąż był w innej wiosce biegnącej w przeciwnym kierunku, o czym później dowiedziała się Mee. Po zakończeniu pościgu żołnierzy Mee wróciła do domu do swojej małej wioski w Koechi w Birmie.<br/><br/>W latach 1997-2000 Mee i tysiące jej podobnych żyło pod ciągłym groźbą przemocy ze strony birmańskich żołnierzy. Wielu ludzi szukało tymczasowego schronienia w dżungli i wracało do domu po opuszczeniu wioski przez żołnierzy, aby zrobić to wszystko ponownie kilka dni później. Około raz w tygodniu Mee i inni byli w ruchu, aby uniknąć schwytania, gwałtu lub śmierci przez żołnierzy.<br/><br/>Podczas jednego z incydentów, mąż Mee pobiegł przed swoją żoną, aby zapewnić żywność dla swojej rodziny. Jej mąż został zauważony przez żołnierzy i zastrzelony. Kula roztrzaskała część jego klatki piersiowej, pozostawiając go poważnie rannym i w niebezpieczeństwie, gdy udał się z rodziną do dżungli w poszukiwaniu bezpieczeństwa.<br/><br/>Przez trzy miesiące mąż Mee ukrywał się i przenosił rodzinę z rozdrażniającą raną u boku. Nie otrzymał żadnej opieki medycznej, z wyjątkiem opieki Mee.<br/><br/>– Bałam się wrócić do Birmy – powiedziała Mee przez tłumacza. – Bałam się śmierci. Płakałam i płakałam każdego dnia – kontynuowała.<br/><br/>Mąż Mee ostatecznie nabrał sił, aby przejść pięć dni w kierunku małej wioski w Tajlandii, gdzie dowiedzieli się o lokalizacji szpitala i obozu dla uchodźców. Kiedy Mee i jej mąż w końcu przybyli do szpitala, przeszedł natychmiastową operację i później wyzdrowiał.<br/><br/>Symbol nadziei<br/><br/>Życie w dżungli dla uciekających birmańskich żołnierzy było naprawdę przerażające i trudne. Prowizoryczne namioty bambusowe z tylko dachem i pokryciami podłogowymi stały się odpowiednimi tymczasowymi mieszkaniami. Wiele kobiet, w tym Mee, urodziło dzieci w dżungli. Wtedy sześcioletni syn Mee asystował przy porodzie swojej siostry o imieniu Eh Ku Hser. Jej imię oznacza miłość – zimno – słodkie. "Zimno" w kulturze birmańskiej oznacza, że nie przechodzi przez ogień życia, ponieważ upał reprezentuje trudne czasy.<br/><br/>"Małam nadzieję, że moja córka będzie wolna od trudnych i kłopotliwych czasów" - powiedziała Mee. "Nie chciałam, aby przeszła przez to, czego doświadczyłam" - kontynuowała.<br/><br/>Dla Mee narodziny jej córki pośród ciemności, męki i strachu były symbolem nadziei na nowe życie. Nadzieja w czasach kryzysu, sama przesłanka nowego UMCOR-Prosperity Candle (United Methodist Committee on Relief) jest również istotą tego, na co świece rzucają światło.<br/><br/>Nowy początek<br/><br/>Z pomocą UNHCR nadzieja na nowe życie rzeczywiście zmaterializowała się dla Mee i jej rodziny, kiedy przesiedlili się do West Springfield w stanie Massachusetts. Tam Mee poznała Moo Kho Paw, inną kobietę, która wyemigrowała z Birmy i która pracowała w Prosperity Candle we Florencji. Organizacja pomaga uchodźcom, którzy uciekli z obszarów konfliktu, odbudować swoje życie poprzez sztukę tworzenia świec. Moo Kho zalecił, aby Mee dołączył do organizacji, a Mee chętnie przyjął.<br/><br/>"Byłam podekscytowana, że wychodzę z domu" - powiedziała Mee. "Wychowałam się, aby wierzyć, że ponieważ jestem kobietą, moją rolą było pozostać w domu i wychowywać rodzinę" - kontynuowała. Podczas gdy wiele birmańskich kobiet chce zrobić więcej dla siebie, często są zachęcane do pozostania gospodyniami domowymi.<br/><br/>Dziś Mee planuje zająć się produkcją świec dla siebie i wspierać pięcioro dzieci, ale wyraziła potrzebę nauki angielskiego w pierwszej kolejności.<br/><br/>„W tajskim obozie dla uchodźców mieliśmy wykształcenie, ale nie było to takie dobre”, powiedziała Mee. „Kiedy byłam dzieckiem, chciałam iść do szkoły, ale powiedziano mi, abym została w domu, ponieważ jestem kobietą. Teraz mam nadzieję, że moje córki pójdą do college'u i staną się lekarzami lub policjantkami" - dodała.<br/><br/>Mee znalazła równowagę w swoim życiu, którą chciałaby, aby znaleźli inni – proste, szczęśliwe życie, w którym praca, troska o członków rodziny i wolność wyboru mają swoje miejsce.<br/><br/>Wsparcie dla kobiet uchodźców w USA<br/><br/>Podziel się historią Dnia Matki ze swoimi bliskimi. A kiedy kupujesz ręcznie robione świece przez Mee, Moo Kho i Naw, inną birmańską uchodźczynię pracującą w Prosperity Candle, wiesz, że pomagasz we wspieraniu ich utrzymania, gdy odbudowują swoje życie i życie swoich członków rodziny w USA. |
| The Precedency Essay<br/><br/>1562 words - 7 pages<br/><br/>Affirmative action is a government policy that gives opportunities to minorities, women, and any group who has been the victim of discrimination in the past. Affirmative action is the outcome of the 1960's Civil Rights movement, growing out of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 which outlawed discrimination based on race, ethnicity, or gender. It was the 1978 Supreme Court decision, The Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, which allowed for the use of race-based preferences as a means of fostering diversity, allowing affirmative action to be used in admissions policies. It was created with the intention to provide equal opportunities for members of minority groups in education and ...view middle of the document...<br/><br/>However, according to a 2007 report by the Pew Research Center, support for affirmative action among the American public has actually increased substantiallyin recent years, climbing from 58% in 1995 to 70% in 2007. Supporters of affirmative action make many arguments in support of affirmative action, in the hopes of getting others to see the genuine good that affirmative actin policies bring to our society. Supporters believe that affirmative action is more of a process rather than an admissions policy. Colleges and universities take the extra initiative to reach out to minority groups, encouraging them to apply. Colleges and universities offer additional financial aid and provide on-campus resources to help better the student's college education. Supporters also note the rising number of minority applications to colleges and universities due in part to affirmative action policies.<br/>Statistics have proven that when affirmative action is eliminated, such as when it was at Berkley College and UCLA in 1998, the minority student admissions fell 61 percent and 36 percent respectively, proving that affirmative action plays a major role in a minority students college admissions process. Affirmative action supporters also believe that diversity in higher education provides a better educational atmosphere for all students, personally and intellectually. If affirmative action were to be eliminated, there would be fewer minority students enrolled in colleges, causing diversity to be fairly slim. Affirmative action policies are also necessary in order to compensate for centuries of racial, economic, and social oppression. Individuals with a higher socioeconomic status have more opportunities than those of lower socioeconomic backgrounds. Supporters believe that certain racial or ethnic groups are disadvantaged because they are frequently in lower income households and consequently are not exposed to the same resources as students from higher socioeconomic classes. Advocates support the notion of competition between students based on merit, but argue that affirmative action compensates for economic differences. College graduates, who have benefitted from affirmative action, have also said that they received better jobs, earned more money, and overall live better lives because of the fortunate opportunities they received through affirmative action.<br/>Supporters of affirmative action continuously stress the severe importance of affirmative action, considering its contributions to enhancing both the college experience and society in general. However, opponents of affirmative action believe that the time has come to end affirmative action. Opponents believe affirmative action was created to ensure fair admission practices to bring change to a long period of racial discrimination. They believe the policy is outdated."It's time to pull the plug on race-based decision making," says Ward Connerly, a Sacramento, California businessman and lead organizer of...<br/><br/>Find Another Essay On The Precedency<br/><br/>754 words - 4 pages<br/>of the burden to continue prospering.

Akcja afirmatywna jest wynikiem ruchu praw obywatelskich z lat 60., wyrastającego z ustawy o prawach obywatelskich z 1964 r., która zakazała dyskryminacji ze względu na rasę, pochodzenie etniczne lub płeć. Decyzja Sądu Najwyższego z 1978 roku, The Regents of University of California v. Bakke, zezwoliła na wykorzystanie preferencji rasowych jako środka wspierania różnorodności, umożliwiając akcje afirmatywne do wykorzystania w polityce rekrutacyjnej. Została ona stworzona z myślą o zapewnieniu równych szans członkom grup mniejszościowych w edukacji i ...zobacz środek dokumentu...<br/><br/>Jednak według raportu Pew Research Center z 2007 r. poparcie dla działań afirmatywnych wśród amerykańskiej opinii publicznej wzrosło znacząco w ostatnich latach, z 58% w 1995 r. do 70% w 2007 r. Zwolennicy akcji afirmatywnej wysuwają wiele argumentów na poparcie akcji afirmatywnej, mając nadzieję, że inni zobaczą prawdziwe dobro, jakie polityka afirmatywna przynosi naszemu społeczeństwu. Zwolennicy uważają, że akcja afirmatywna jest bardziej procesem niż polityką przyjęć. Kolegia i uniwersytety podejmują dodatkową inicjatywę, aby dotrzeć do grup mniejszościowych, zachęcając je do stosowania. Uczelnie i uniwersytety oferują dodatkową pomoc finansową i zapewniają zasoby na terenie kampusu, aby pomóc w lepszym kształceniu studentów. Zwolennicy zauważają również rosnącą liczbę wniosków mniejszościowych do szkół wyższych i uniwersytetów, częściowo ze względu na politykę działań afirmatywnych.<br/>Statystyki udowodniły, że gdy akcja afirmatywna jest wyeliminowana, na przykład w Berkley College i UCLA w 1998 roku, przyjęć studentów mniejszości spadła odpowiednio o 61% i 36%, co dowodzi, że akcja afirmatywna odgrywa główną rolę w procesie przyjmowania studentów mniejszości. Zwolennicy afirmatywnych działań wierzą również, że różnorodność w szkolnictwie wyższym zapewnia lepszą atmosferę edukacyjną dla wszystkich studentów, zarówno osobiście, jak i intelektualnie. Gdyby wyeliminowano akcje afirmatywne, na uczelniach zapisałoby się mniej studentów z mniejszości, co spowodowałoby, że różnorodność byłaby dość smukła. Polityka działań afirmatywnych jest również konieczna, aby zrekompensować wieki ucisku rasowego, ekonomicznego i społecznego. Osoby o wyższym statusie społeczno-ekonomicznym mają więcej możliwości niż osoby o niższym pochodzeniu społeczno-ekonomicznym. Zwolennicy uważają, że niektóre grupy rasowe lub etniczne są w niekorzystnej sytuacji, ponieważ często znajdują się w gospodarstwach domowych o niższych dochodach i w konsekwencji nie są narażone na takie same zasoby jak studenci z wyższych klas społeczno-ekonomicznych. Zwolennicy popierają pojęcie konkurencji między studentami w oparciu o zasługi, ale twierdzą, że działania afirmatywne kompensują różnice ekonomiczne. Absolwenci uczelni, którzy skorzystali z akcji afirmatywnej, powiedzieli również, że otrzymali lepszą pracę, zarobili więcej pieniędzy i ogólnie żyją lepiej dzięki szczęśliwym możliwościom, które otrzymali dzięki akcji afirmatywnej.<br/>Zwolennicy akcji afirmatywnej nieustannie podkreślają poważne znaczenie akcji afirmatywnej, biorąc pod uwagę jej wkład w poprawę zarówno doświadczenia uczelni, jak i społeczeństwa w ogóle. Przeciwnicy akcji afirmatywnej uważają jednak, że nadszedł czas, aby zakończyć akcje afirmatywne. Przeciwnicy uważają, że akcja afirmatywna została stworzona w celu zapewnienia uczciwych praktyk przyjmowania, aby wprowadzić zmiany do długiego okresu dyskryminacji rasowej. Uważają, że polityka jest przestarzała."

| Combinations<br/><br/>Combinations Are defenses against a punch, choreographed responses to different types of attacks. They have many names across the martial arts but (in my experience) every art has a version of them. This makes them different than forms because there are plenty of martial arts that have no forms. What makes there partner exercises so universal? Why practice a specific response when (in reality) timing, type of attack, size of the attacker, and a hundred other factors will make it so you never use that entire choreographed response? And finally, how can we practice for a real defense situation and avoid injury at the same time?<br/><br/>The universality of combinations is impressive, to say the least. Our style of Kenpo karate has a list of 108 combos that can be learned. (Most students only learn 20-30 though) In Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu you spend whole classes practicing arm bars and chokes, learning every subtlety to the move while your partner offers little to no resistance. Every boxer has spent hours in front of the bag and/or mirror throwing the same combination of punches until their body moves by reflex alone. Combinations are universal because we have no better way to introduce movement and then practice the subtle positions required to make them work. Hitting a small pressure point through clothing takes A LOT of practice, catching an arm bar with control requires a carefully placed hip and a sneaky setup, and a great combination is only useful if you can through it from a balanced and protected position. Can you think of a better way to gain these skills?<br/><br/>There is any number of factors that determine how you respond to an attack and whether in a sparring match or in a fight, I have NEVER used a full combination in my defense. Why, then, do we spend hours practicing them? We practice these choreographed responses because the objective is not to pull combination 8 out every time you see a hook punch but to show you one way of blocking it and then a possible way to follow it up. I have never chosen to use combination 3 in a reality situation but the block is one of my go-to moves. Combinations add tools to the toolbox they do not fix the car.<br/><br/>The last question is a question of safety. If we practice for the sake of reality we need to replicate reality. How do we prevent injury while doing so? When it comes down to it, it's about building trust. We start slow and learn to trust that we have control over ourselves. We learn to trust our partners have control as well. In more time we learn to trust our control over our partner and (a little scarier) we learn to trust our partner's control over us. In the end (with a lot of practice) you can move are full speed, tossing your partner, and being thrown without fear of injury.<br/><br/>Combinations are universal for a reason; they are practiced so they can be dissected into their parts, and we stay safe by starting slow and building trust. As with everything else in the martial arts, combinations have many reasons behind their practice and execution. | Kombinacje<br/><br/>Kombinacje to obrona przed uderzeniem, choreograficzne odpowiedzi na różne rodzaje ataków. Mają wiele imion w sztukach walki, ale (z mojego doświadczenia) każda sztuka ma ich wersję. To sprawia, że różnią się one od form, ponieważ istnieje wiele sztuk walki, które nie mają form. Co sprawia, że ćwiczenia partnerskie są tak uniwersalne? Po co ćwiczyć konkretną odpowiedź, gdy (w rzeczywistości) czas, rodzaj ataku, wielkość atakującego i setki innych czynników sprawią, że nigdy nie użyjesz całej tej choreograficznej odpowiedzi? I wreszcie, jak możemy ćwiczyć w prawdziwej sytuacji obronnej i jednocześnie unikać kontuzji?<br/><br/>Uniwersalność kombinacji jest imponująca. Nasz styl Kenpo karate ma listę 108 kombinacji, których można się nauczyć. (Większość uczniów uczy się tylko 20-30) W brazylijskim jiu-jitsu spędzasz całe lekcje ćwicząc paski i dławiki, ucząc się każdej subtelności ruchu, podczas gdy twój partner oferuje niewiele lub wcale nie ma oporu. Każdy bokser spędził godziny przed torbą i / lub lustrem rzucając taką samą kombinację ciosów, aż ich ciało porusza się odruchem. Kombinacje są uniwersalne, ponieważ nie mamy lepszego sposobu, aby wprowadzić ruch, a następnie ćwiczyć subtelne pozycje wymagane do ich pracy. Uderzenie małego punktu nacisku przez odzież wymaga dużo praktyki, złapanie ramienia z kontrolą wymaga starannie umieszczonego biodra i podstępnego ustawienia, a świetna kombinacja jest przydatna tylko wtedy, gdy możesz przejść przez nią z zrównoważonej i chronionej pozycji. Czy możesz wymyślić lepszy sposób na zdobycie tych umiejętności?<br/><br/>Istnieje wiele czynników, które decydują o tym, jak reagujesz na atak i czy w meczu sparingowym czy w walce nigdy nie użyłem pełnej kombinacji w swojej obronie. Dlaczego więc spędzamy godziny na ich ćwiczeniach? Ćwiczymy te choreograficzne odpowiedzi, ponieważ celem nie jest wyciągnięcie kombinacji 8 za każdym razem, gdy widzisz uderzenie hakiem, ale aby pokazać ci jeden sposób na zablokowanie go, a następnie możliwy sposób na śledzenie go. Nigdy nie zdecydowałem się na użycie kombinacji 3 w rzeczywistości, ale blok jest jednym z moich ruchów. Kombinacje dodają narzędzia do skrzynki narzędziowej, nie naprawią samochodu.<br/><br/>Ostatnie pytanie jest kwestią bezpieczeństwa. Jeśli ćwiczymy dla dobra rzeczywistości, musimy powielać rzeczywistość. Jak zapobiegać urazom przy tym? Jeśli chodzi o to, chodzi o budowanie zaufania. Zaczynamy powoli i uczymy się ufać, że mamy kontrolę nad sobą. Uczymy się również ufać, że nasi partnerzy mają kontrolę. Z biegiem czasu uczymy się ufać naszej kontroli nad naszym partnerem i (trochę bardziej przerażające) uczymy się ufać kontroli naszego partnera nad nami. W końcu (z dużą ilością ćwiczeń) możesz poruszać się z pełną prędkością, rzucając swoim partnerem i rzucając się bez obawy o obrażenia.<br/><br/>Kombinacje są uniwersalne z jakiegoś powodu; są one praktykowane, aby można je było podzielić na części, a my pozostajemy bezpieczni, zaczynając powoli i budując zaufanie. Podobnie jak wszystko inne w sztukach walki, kombinacje mają wiele powodów do ich praktyki i wykonania. |
