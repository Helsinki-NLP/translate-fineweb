| Smith Chuck - Through the Bible C2000 SeriesShall we turn to the book of Acts, chapter one, as we begin our study of the early church.<br/>Luke, the author of the book of Acts, a companion of Paul the apostle, who was author also of the Gospel According to Luke, wrote these two treatises to a friend, Theophilus. Theophilus is a Greek name. It's a name that has a beautiful meaning. The name means lover of God. There are some who believe that it was not a man at all, but that the gospel and the book of Acts were addressed to the lovers of God, whoever you may be. There are other traditions that say that Theophilus was actually Luke's master. That in those days physicians were slaves, usually the slave of a wealthy patron. So that Luke's master was Theophilus, and he released Luke to be with Paul on the missionary journeys. Thus, Luke is writing back to his former master. This is an early tradition of the church, but it is, of course, impossible to prove, like so many of the traditions.<br/>There are also those who believe that when Paul was in Troas and he received a vision of a man calling unto him saying, "Come over to Macedonia and help us," that that man in Paul's vision was none other than Luke. For the first one that Paul really met when he came to Macedonia was Luke. And as we are in the book of Acts, you will find that when we get to that portion of the book of Acts, Luke begins to write more in the first person rather than the third person. So it is, evidently, at this particular point in the Acts of the Apostles that Luke became a companion of Paul and began to journey with him. He began to use the pronouns "we" and "us" instead of "they" and "them." This is, no doubt, where Luke became a participant and an eyewitness of those things that were happening from this point on. We will bring this out to you when we get to that point.<br/>He begins the Acts of the Apostles by tying it with the Gospel According to Luke. It is interesting that the very last thing that Luke records in his gospel is the very first thing he records in the Acts of the Apostles. We find the gospel of Luke closing as Jesus is telling His disciples to wait in Jerusalem until they be endued with power from on high. And then Jesus ascended up into heaven, and so he closes the gospel. In opening the Acts of the Apostles, he writes,<br/>The former treatise [that is, the Gospel According to Luke,] have I written unto you, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and teach ( Act 1:1 ),<br/>The key word is began. The Gospel According to Luke is not the full story of the ministry of Jesus Christ. It is only the beginning of the ministry of Jesus Christ. Jesus continues to minister to the needs of people. Jesus continues to heal the sick. Jesus continues to raise the dead. Jesus continues to minister His love and His gospel to the world, only now He is ministering through those disciples who have been anointed with His Holy Spirit. But the ministry of Christ is continuing; basically, is the premise that Luke takes in the Acts of the Apostles. The former treatise of all that Jesus began, both to do and to teach.<br/>Now because of that, the Acts of the Apostles is an unfinished book: in that the Lord today continues to work through the lives of those who have dedicated themselves to be the instruments of God. To be led and guided and anointed by His Holy Spirit, to continue the ministry of Jesus in the world today. Now God has ordained that His work should be accomplished through human instruments. I do not say that it must be accomplished. God can use angelic beings for His work, and there will come a time, during the book of Revelation when God will use angels to proclaim His gospel to people all over the world. Revelation, chapter 14, "The first angel flying through the midst of heaven having the everlasting gospel" ( Rev 14:6 ). But at the present time, God has chosen to use human instruments. As imperfect as they may be, yet that's what God has ordained to use. The exciting thing about that is, God will use me and God will use you. So many times, we're begging off, "O Lord, I can't speak. I've never been able to speak before or even now, Lord." As Moses tried to beg off the call of God. Jeremiah said, "Lord, I'm just a kid; no one's going to listen to me." And we all have our excuses why we can't be used. Don't we? We all know the reasons why God couldn't use us.<br/>One time, as the Lord was calling a prophet to do His work, he said, "Lord, send whoever you want." The Lord said, "Hey, I've called you." "Lord, good idea; send whoever you want." So often we're in that position, "Lord, send by the hand of whomsoever you will, anybody but me Lord." And yet, God has ordained to use us.<br/>Now, each of us can show our own imperfections. Each of us can point out our own inabilities, and all of us can find an excuse why God wouldn't want to use me. But yet, God has chosen to use you. That through your life He might reveal Himself to a needy world. You wonder when God has such instruments to use how He ever got the job done, don't you?<br/>Until the day in which he was taken up, after that he through the Holy Spirit had given commandments to the apostles whom he had chosen ( Act 1:2 ):<br/>That is what he ended the Gospel of Luke with. The day that Jesus was taken up, after He had told the apostles to wait for the endowment of power.<br/>To whom he also [that is the apostles he also] showed himself alive to them after his passion [or death] by many infallible proofs ( Act 1:3 ),<br/>It is difficult to deny the fact of the resurrection of Jesus Christ. I was amused, as well as annoyed and irritated, by an article I read in the Santa Ana Register this last Saturday. Of the creation science and evolutionary theories being presented in the county schools. How that, this one professor said that he teaches a science class, and thus, they deal only in facts, and that they don't have any place for theories. Because science is based upon fact and creation is based upon religious superstitions. It takes a lot of faith to believe the religious theories. When you are dealing with facts, you can just accept them. I thought, "Very interesting in that science class, they taught me it was a fact that the world was four billion years old. Now today they are teaching it's a fact that the world is twelve billion years old. And it wasn't that long ago that I went to school."<br/>It's interesting that the Bible has never needed to be revised or updated to meet the current data that men have discovered. And yet, if you would take my high school science textbooks today and try to teach a science class from them, you would find that many of the things that were taught as scientific fact when I was in high school are no longer recognized as scientific fact. The simple cell protoplasm is no longer a simple cell, but extremely complex. If there is any fact that can be attested to in history it is the fact of the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.<br/>We have a jurisprudence system that is based upon the testimony of witnesses. If a man is accused of a crime and there are people who witnessed that crime while it was being committed, and they are brought to the standard, and they swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help them God. And in their questioning they affirm that, "I saw that man in the bank on May twenty-third. I saw him pull out a gun from his coat. I heard him demand that all of the money be given to him. I saw him as he left the bank. I saw him as the officer apprehended him outside." And if you can get three or four witnesses to point to that man and will keep their testimony under cross-examination, that man is judged to be guilty. He is the one who did it. We have two or three witnesses that are testifying the same story about that man, and it is accepted as fact that he is the one who perpetrated the crime and is guilty. You've got witnesses who have sworn to tell the truth that are verifying.<br/>After the death of Jesus, when He rose again, He appeared unto many different people who gave sworn testimony that they saw Him. That they talked to Him, that He appeared to them in various places under different circumstances. And for a period of forty days was visiting with them. And at one time, up to as many as five hundred people who were gathered at one place, He appeared. It's difficult to just cast aside or deny the witness of these people. To do so is to discredit our whole jurisprudence system. But not only that, these men who testified that they saw the risen Lord, that they talked to Him, that they ate with Him, they, all of them, with the exception of one, met violent deaths at the hands of other people because of their affirming that the story they told was true. You talk about witnesses sworn to tell the truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth. If a person's life was threatened because of that witness, and it was a lie, at least one them would've broken under the pressure. They would've confessed to the entire hoax. "He showed Himself alive after His passion by many infallible proofs."<br/>being seen of them for forty days, speaking to them of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God ( Act 1:3 ):<br/>Sometimes we fault the disciples because of their questions of the timing of the kingdom of God. Let it be remembered that the kingdom of God was the favorite subject of Jesus Christ. He was always talking about the kingdom of God, and it is a great hope that He was planting into the hearts of all men. Things are not always going to continue corrupted as they are. The world is not going to go forever under the power of darkness, under the bondage of evil. God is going to one day establish His kingdom upon the earth. A kingdom of righteous joy and peace. "Jesus shall reign, where ere the sun doth her successive journeys run. And His kingdom will extend from shore to shore." And that day will be the most glorious day the world has ever seen, as sickness and suffering and pain will be abolished in His kingdom. As sin and greed and these things that have made the world such an intolerable place will be abolished in His kingdom. The godless commercialism, the exploitation of man, all of these things abolished in His glorious kingdom when He reigns. No wonder the disciples were anxious to get it on. I'm anxious to get it on; I'm anxious for His kingdom to come. And Jesus told us when we pray, the first petition is, "Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven" ( Mat 6:10 ). This is the right kind of a desire that we should all have. I desire the kingdom of God. And so He was talking to them, during this forty-day period, of the kingdom.<br/>And, being assembled together with them, he commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which, saith he, you have heard of me ( Act 1:4 ).<br/>He said, "Now look, wait here in Jerusalem until you receive the promise of the Father." This promise that He is referring to is, no doubt, the promise in Joel where the Lord promised, "And it shall come to pass in the later days, saith the Lord, that I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and daughters will prophesy, and your young men shall dream dreams, your old men shall see visions: and upon my servants and my handmaidens shall I pour out my Spirit, saith the Lord" ( Joe 2:28-29 ). The promise of the Father: the day is going to come when God is going to pour out His Spirit upon all flesh, all of the believers. They will, each one, receive that dynamic from God.<br/>For John [He said,] truly baptized with water; but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now ( Act 1:5 ).<br/>The idea of baptism was that of emersion, the bapteedzo. John baptized with water, submerged the people in water, "you're going to be submerged in the Holy Spirit in not many days."<br/>Now when they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, will you at this time restore the kingdom to Israel? ( Act 1:6 )<br/>"When is it going to be, Lord? When's the time for this restoration?" And Jesus is talking to them now, not about the kingdom, but about the power that they're going to receive for service. And so He brushes aside their question.<br/>Saying unto them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father has put in his own power ( Act 1:7 ).<br/>"It's not for you to know." They lived constantly in the anticipation of the immediate setting up of the kingdom. During the entire lifetime of Jesus, they were expecting Him at any moment to go into the phone booth and come out as the savior of the world. Shazzam! Showing His power and overthrowing the governments of the world, establishing God's kingdom upon the earth. And they were waiting daily for this change to transpire. And whenever Jesus would talk about going to Jerusalem, being turned over into the hands of sinful man, and then being crucified, "Oh, oh no, Lord. No, no you don't understand the kingdom, Lord. Be that far from Thee." When Jesus died on the cross, they were all greatly disappointed.<br/>The two disciples on the road to Emmaus, so sad. "Hey, fellows. How come you're so sad as your walking along?" "What do you mean? You must be a stranger around here if you don't know the things that have been happening lately in Jerusalem." "What things?" "Oh, a fellow by the name of Jesus of Nazareth...oh man, it was mighty and powerful. The anointing of God was upon His life. We had hoped that in Him was the deliverance of Israel, but they crucified Him. We had hoped . . . now it's dead." Now He's risen, and He's saying, "In a few days, fellows, you're going to receive the promise of the Father." "Oh, what promise? The promise of the establishing of the kingdom?" You see, it was legitimate that they should ask. "Is this it Lord? Alright! Is this the time? Are you going to set up your kingdom now?" "No. It's not for you to know those times that the Father's appointed or that the Father has in His own power. But, you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you."<br/>Now here, the Greek preposition epi is used to signify a new relationship that they were to have with the Holy Spirit. In the Gospel According to John, chapter 14, as Jesus is there promising to send the Holy Spirit, He said, "I will not leave you comfortless. I will come to you, and I will pray the Father, and He will send to you another comforter, even the Spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth Him not neither knows Him, but you know Him for He dwells with you, and He shall be in you" ( Joh 14:17-18 ). Same Greek preposition as ours, only they spell it "en" instead of "in." Two-fold relationship there in John: He is with you, but He's going to be dwelling in you. But now Jesus said you're going to receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you. The Greek preposition epi, which is translated in different texts throughout the New Testament as "upon" or "over" or I like it, "overflows."<br/>In the seventh chapter of the gospel of John: "On the last day, the great day of the feast when Jesus stood there on the Temple Mount and cried to the people, 'If any man thirst let him come unto Me and drink: and he who drinks of the water that I give, out of his innermost being there will gush torrents of living water.'" John said, "This spake He of the Spirit, which was not yet given which they who believe on Him should receive" ( Joh 7:37-39 ). What did He speak of the Spirit? That it would be like a torrent of living water flowing out. I like, "When the Spirit overflows you," upon you, or over you, or overflows from you. So the three-fold relationship: He is with you prior to your conversion, He is the one who causes you to realize that you are a sinner, He is the one who points to Jesus Christ as the answer as He convinces the world of sin, of righteous, and of judgment. The moment you open your life and heart to Jesus Christ and invite Him to come in, the Holy Spirit comes and begins to indwell you. He shall be in you. "Know ye not that you are not your own, you have been bought with a price, therefore glorify God in your body and your spirit which are His. And know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit which is in you? Be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess, but be filled, or be ye being filled with the Spirit" ( 1Co 6:19-20 ,Eph 5:18 ). But now here's a third relationship. This is an empowering experience.<br/>You will receive [the dunamus] the dynamics, when the Holy Spirit has come [epi] upon you [or over you, or when there is that overflow from you]: and ye shall be witnesses unto me ( Act 1:8 )<br/>And so the dynamic, to be a witness for Jesus Christ. It is interesting that the word witness in Greek is the word martus from where we get our word martyr. And in Greek it does mean martyr. A witness is one who not only proclaims what he believes, he lives what he believes, he is what he believes, and he believes it so strongly, that if necessary, he'll die for what he believes. That's how strong is his belief. He's a martus. You can't stop him. He's not afraid to die for what he believes.<br/>You remember when Paul was on his way back to Jerusalem and Agabus came down from Caesarea and he took Paul's girdle and tied himself up and he said, "So is the man who owns this girdle to be bound when he gets to Jerusalem." And Paul's friends began to weep, saying, "Oh, Paul, don't go, don't go." And he said, "What do you mean by these tears? Do you think you're going to dissuade me? Do you think I'm worried about being bound? I'm ready to die." He was a martus. "I'm ready to die." Being put to death for your faith did not make you a martyr; because you were a martyr, you were put to death. Because you were a witness, because you believed it so strong. So, it did not make you a witness, it only proved what you were. You were a witness all along. If you hadn't been a martus, you would've never gone to your death. You would've recanted; you would've said, "Whoa, whoa, wait, wait. Hold on, let's change course here. I think that I may have made a mistake." Then you say, "Well, he wasn't a martus. Stealing a horse doesn't make you a horse thief; it only proves that you were. No one steals a horse unless he's a horse thief. So, stealing it doesn't make you a horse thief, it only proves that you were all along. Being martyred only proves what you were a witness, a martus. "And you will be witnesses." And isn't it interesting that most of them were martyred? "Witnesses unto Me."<br/>The witness was to be both in Jerusalem, and in all of Judea ( Act 1:8 ),<br/>The witness began right at home. The hardest place, isn't it? It's to start right at home in Jerusalem, and then the area around Jerusalem, the area of Judea. And then it was to spread up into Samaria. And then it was to go out into the uttermost parts of the world. And as we study the book of Acts, we will see this very progression. How the witness began in Jerusalem. We'll get that in the next chapter. And then we'll see how it began to spread through out Judea. And then Phillip went up into Samaria, and then finally Paul and Barnabas are called to go into the uttermost parts of the world. And so the witness spread through the anointing and the empowering of the Holy Spirit.<br/>Now when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight ( Act 1:9 ).<br/>This is the final promise made by Jesus to His disciples. This is it, the final words prior to His ascension. Of course, later He came and talked to Paul and others, but prior to His ascension, this is His final word. And upon this, when He had spoken these things, while they were watching Him, He was taken up and a cloud received Him out of their sight.<br/>And while they were looking steadfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, there were two men who stood by them in white apparel ( Act 1:10 );<br/>We assume they were angels.<br/>Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as you have seen him go into heaven ( Act 1:11 ).<br/>They saw Him as He ascended up into heaven and they will behold Him when He comes again. "Behold the Lord cometh with ten thousands of His saints, to execute judgement upon the earth" (Jud 1:14-15). And then, "Unto Him who loved us and gave Himself for us and who has made us unto our God, kings and priests who shall reign with Him upon the earth, behold the Lord cometh, and every eye shall see Him, and they also who pierced Him shall mourn" Rev 1:5-7 ). So the Lord's coming. Every eye shall see Him. The Jehovah Witnesses say that He is already come, but it was a secret coming. As it was only the disciples that saw Him go, it was only the disciples, of the Jehovah Witnesses, who saw Him return. But Jesus said, "If they say unto you, 'He has come in secret and has gone into a secret chamber don't believe it'" ( Mat 24:26 ). So you have to choose, to believe Jesus or them.<br/>"This same Jesus which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as you've seen Him go into heaven."<br/>Now there's a very interesting verse in II John, verse Act 1:7 , "For many deceivers are entered into the world who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh." That, unfortunately, is a poor translation of the Greek. For this participle is in the present tense and should be translated "is coming in the flesh." Those who would deny that Jesus Christ is coming in the flesh. What does John say of them? "They are a deceiver and an antichrist. Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward. For whosoever transgresses and abides not in the doctrine of Christ, has not God. He that abides in the doctrine of Christ, he has both the Father and the Son. And if there come any unto your door (on Saturday morning) and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, and neither bid him good-bye. For he that bids him good-bye is a partaker of his evil deeds" (2Jn 1:7-11). Ask them one question, "Is Jesus coming in the flesh?" Just ask them that question. And if they say no, just remember what John warned you and what John told you. "If any confess not that Jesus Christ is coming in the flesh." Do you remember when He was with the disciples and He said, "Give me something to eat"? He said, "You know, spirits don't eat; touch me. See? It's me." So, this same Jesus is coming again in the same manner in which they saw Him go into heaven. And I, for one, believe that that coming is very soon.<br/>Then retuned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a Sabbath's day journey [about two-thirds of a mile]. And when they were come in, they went up into an upper room, where there abode both Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, and Phillip, and Thomas, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon Zelotes, and Judas the brother of James. And these all continued in one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers ( Act 1:12-14 ).<br/>This is the last mention of Mary the mother of Jesus. At this point and from this point on, there is no further mention of her in the Acts of the Apostles or in the epistles. No mention of her death or of her miraculous ascension into heaven, without death. Nothing is mentioned in the scripture. It is silent.<br/>His brethren would be a reference probably to James and to Jude and to those other brothers who were sons of Joseph and Mary.<br/>The upper room--there are some who say that it is the same upper room in which Jesus had the Last Supper with His disciples. And yet, there are others who hold to this upper room being a room in the temple precincts where the early church met. Take your choice.<br/>And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples, and said, (the number of their names together were about one hundred and twenty,) men and brethren, this Scripture must needs have been fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit by the mouth of David spake before concerning Judas, which was a guide to those who took Jesus ( Act 1:15-16 ).<br/>Here again, Peter still his same impetuous self. They're waiting in prayer and supplication, and Peter stands up and says, "Fellows, there's a scripture that's gotta be fulfilled." And you know he's going to move ahead, "Let's get the program going; let's cast lots and find out who's going to take Judas' place." I do feel that Peter was again in the flesh, manifesting that impetuous nature that was his. And I think that the future history of the church in the book of Acts points this out. I am interested in Peter's understanding of the scriptures, how that he is quoting from so many places in the Old Testament. Peter does manifest a very great understanding of the Old Testament scriptures which is a point in his favor.<br/>Notice that Peter ascribes to the Holy Spirit those things that David wrote. So that, "All scripture is given by inspiration of God" ( 2Ti 3:16 ). Not part of the scriptures. Because, if you tell me that part of the scriptures are given by inspiration of God, then I must ask you, "What parts are by inspiration and what parts are not by inspiration?" And then you are then the authority who tells me what part I can believe and what part I can't believe. And the minute that God is no longer the authority but you're the authority, I'm in trouble. Beware of those who say, "Well, you can't believe all of the scriptures." The scriptures themselves say, "All scripture is given by inspiration of God." And here, Luke in writing of what Peter was saying, declares that David was actually the spokesman for the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit, by the mouth of David, spake concerning Judas.<br/>For he was numbered with us, [he was one of the twelve] he had obtained a part of this ministry. But now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity; and falling headlong ( Act 1:17-18 ),<br/>He purchased the field, the potter's field as Zachariah the eleventh chapter declares.<br/>and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all of his bowels gushed out ( Act 1:18 ).<br/>There are those who find a discrepancy in the scriptures, because in one of the gospels we are told that when Judas came back and tried to return the money, and they said, "Hey, it's your problem. We can't take it." And put it back in the temple treasury. "It's blood money." Then he threw it there on the floor of the temple and he went out and hung himself. Here Peter tells us that he fell headlong and just popped. And there are those who imagine a discrepancy. Very simple, he went up into the tree to hang himself, tied the rope around his neck and tied it to the limb and jumped. And the force of the fall either snapped the rope or his head, and he fell on down into the canyon and just as he said it here.<br/>It was known to all of the dwellers at Jerusalem; insomuch that the field is called in their tongue, Aceldama, that is to say, The field of blood. For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be desolate, and let no man dwell therein: and, His bishoprick let another take ( Act 1:19-20 ).<br/>Now in reality he's quoting from two different Psalms here. From Psa 69:25 ,he puts it together with Psa 109:8 . And putting the two together he finds these prophecies concerning Judas.<br/>Wherefore of these men ( Act 1:21 )<br/>Now here is where they are looking for someone to take Judas' place to be an apostle. Here are the qualifications they looked for in that time.<br/>Wherefore of these men which have companied with us all the time that the Lord Jesus when in and out among us ( Act 1:21 ),<br/>Now you remember there were many disciples, many disciples of which Jesus chose ten to be apostles. And the word apostle means "one who is sent out." Or chose twelve to be apostles, so He sent out the twelve. The number of human government. "We only have eleven. We need one to take Judas' place, but we need one who has been with us all the while from the beginning with Jesus."<br/>From the time he was baptized by John, until the day he was taken up from us, must one be ordained to be a witness [of what?] of His resurrection ( Act 1:22 ).<br/>So these were the requirements they were looking for. Someone who had been around the whole while. From the time of John's baptism to the ascension. And one who saw the risen Lord, and thus could bear fact of the resurrection, their testimony to the fact.<br/>Now Paul the apostle, later in asserting the fact that he was an apostle said, "Have I not seen the risen Christ?" Evidently that was one of the requirements of apostleship. Someone asked me, "Are there apostles today?" Well, I don't know. I don't think that there are in the same sense that they were in the New Testament. Surely there is none today who can bear witness to the resurrection as they did.<br/>They appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias. And they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord, which knowest the hearts of all men, show whether of these two that you have chosen ( Act 1:23-24 ),<br/>I think that we often make this mistake of giving the Lord two choices, both wrong. Limiting God, you see. We're so prone to do this. Obviously, Paul was God's choice. Peter was impetuous, and jumping the gun said, "Hey, we've got to do something, you know, gotta help God out. You know, one's missing and we've got to fill him in." And yet, "God, which one of these two do you want?" And giving God the two choices.<br/>That he may take part of this ministry and this apostleship, from which Judas by the transgression fell, that he might go to his own place. And so they gave forth their lots ( Act 1:25-26 );<br/>An interesting way by which they sought to determine the will of God. Let's throw dice, find out what God's will is here. It's interesting to me, the various ways that people have devised to discern the will of God. Now, in the Old Testament times they had an interesting way of coming to the priest, who would inquire of the Lord for them through the Urim and the Thummim, the "lights and perfections." Just what these Urim and Thummim were, we don't know. I'm sure they were not the colored glasses that Joseph Smith found with the Golden Tablets; the magic glasses, that when you put them on, you could suddenly read the hieroglyphic writing.<br/>There are those who say that the Urim and Thummim were actually a black and a white stone that was worn in a pouch on the chest of the priest. They would pray and ask the Lord a particular question. You remember that David was asking the Lord definite questions: "Lord, shall we go out against the Philistines?" The answer was, "No." So again, the next day, "Lord, shall we go out against the Philistines?" The answer was, "Yes." "When shall we go?" They would ask specific questions, and the Lord would direct them through the Urim and the Thummin. They say that the priest would pray, seek God, and then reach in and pull out one of the two stones. If it was the white stone, it was a yes answer. If it was a no, then it would be the black stone that he would pull out. Some even say we get the term blackballed from this Urim and Thummim. Actually, back in the original it is a no vote against a particular project or idea. Just what the Urim and Thummim were, we don't know. But during the Old Testament period, they did use a method of casting lots to determine the will of God.<br/>So here the disciples are picking up on the same thing as they are throwing the dice to see which of the two fellows that God had chosen to replace Judas Iscariot.<br/>the lot fell on Matthias; he was numbered with the eleven ( Act 1:26 ).<br/>Now who in the world is Matthias? No one ever heard of him before or since. It'll be interesting to meet Matthias and find out who he is and what he did. I think from the subsequent history, it's obvious to assume that God chose Paul as an apostle. Paul declares it himself. Now this is the last time we ever read of them seeking to discern the will of God by the casting of lots or by a chance kind of a thing.<br/>I know a fellow today, in seeking to discern the will of the Lord, will pray and ask the Lord a question. He'll have ten pennies in his pocket, and as he's praying, he'll take the pennies with his eyes closed and put them down on the table, and if they all come up heads, it's a yes. An interesting thing, every once in a while, they'll all come up heads, and that's pretty good odds. Yet, we don't find any pattern for this after the Holy Spirit was given. Once the Holy Spirit came upon the church, then the Holy Spirit began to speak to them and direct them. And the Holy Spirit said, "Separate unto me Paul and Barnabas for the ministry where I have called them" ( Act 13:2 ). And the Holy Spirit sent them forth. So we find the church more directly guided by the Holy Spirit. Once the Holy Spirit came, this throwing dice to find out the will of God was set aside.<br/>"<br/><br/>King James Version<br/><br/>This is the 1769 King James Version of the Holy Bible (also known as the Authorized Version). "Public Domain" | Smith Chuck - Poprzez Biblię C2000 SeriesCzy zwrócimy się do Księgi Dziejów Apostolskich, rozdział pierwszy, kiedy zaczynamy nasze badania wczesnego kościoła.<br/>Łukasz, autor książki Dziejów Apostolskich, towarzysz apostoła Pawła, który był również autorem Ewangelii według Łukasza, napisał te dwa traktaty do przyjaciela, Theophilusa. Theophilus to greckie imię. To imię ma piękne znaczenie. Imię to oznacza miłośnika Boga. Są tacy, którzy wierzą, że to nie był człowiek, ale że Ewangelia i Księga Dziejów Apostolskich zostały skierowane do miłośników Boga, kimkolwiek jesteście. Istnieją inne tradycje, które mówią, że Teofil był panem Łukasza, że w tamtych czasach lekarze byli niewolnikami, zwykle niewolnikami bogatego patrona. Tak, że mistrzem Łukasza był Teofil, a on wypuścił Łukasza, aby być z Pawłem w podróżach misyjnych. Tak więc Łukasz pisze do swojego byłego pana. Jest to wczesna tradycja kościoła, ale jest to oczywiście niemożliwe do udowodnienia, jak wiele innych tradycji.<br/>Są też tacy, którzy wierzą, że gdy Paweł był w Troadzie i otrzymał wizję człowieka wzywającego go mówiącego: „Przyjdź do Macedonii i pomóż nam”, że ten człowiek w wizji Pawła nie był nikim innym jak Łukasz. Pierwszym, którego Paweł naprawdę spotkał, gdy przybył do Macedonii, był Łukasz. A ponieważ jesteśmy w księdze Dziejów Apostolskich, przekonasz się, że kiedy dojdziemy do tej części ksiąg Dziejów Apostolskich, Łukasz zaczyna pisać więcej w pierwszej osobie niż w trzeciej osobie. Tak więc w tym konkretnym momencie Dziejów Apostolskich Łukasz stał się towarzyszem Pawła i zaczął podróżować z nim. Zaczął używać zaimków „my” i „nas” zamiast „oni” i „oni”. Jest to bez wątpienia miejsce, w którym Luke stał się uczestnikiem i naocznym świadkiem tych rzeczy, które działy się od tego momentu.<br/>Zaczyna Dzieje Apostolskie, łącząc je z Ewangelią według Łukasza. Interesujące jest to, że ostatnia rzecz, którą Łukasz zapisuje w swojej ewangelii, jest pierwszą rzeczą, którą zapisuje w Dziejach Apostolskich. Znajdujemy Ewangelię Łukasza zamykającą się, gdy Jezus mówi swoim uczniom, aby czekali w Jerozolimie, aż zostaną obdarzeni mocą z wysoka. A potem Jezus wstąpił do nieba i tak zamyka Ewangelię. W otwarciu Dziejów Apostolskich pisze:<br/>Pierwszy traktat [to jest Ewangelia według Łukasza,] napisałem do ciebie, o Theophilus, ze wszystkiego, co Jezus zaczął zarówno robić i nauczać (Dz 1:1),<br/>Zaczęło się słowo kluczowe. Ewangelia według Łukasza nie jest pełną historią służby Jezusa Chrystusa. To tylko początek służby Jezusa Chrystusa. Jezus nadal służy potrzebom ludzi. Jezus nadal leczy chorych. Jezus nadal wskrzesza umarłych. Jezus nadal służy światu Jego miłości i Jego ewangelii, tylko teraz On służy przez tych uczniów, którzy zostali namaszczeni Jego Duchem Świętym. Ale posługa Chrystusa jest kontynuowana; zasadniczo, jest to założenie, które Łukasz przyjmuje w Dziejach Apostolskich. Dawny traktat o wszystkim, co Jezus rozpoczął, zarówno do czynienia, jak i do nauczania.<br/>Z tego powodu Dzieje Apostolskie są niedokończoną księgą: w tym Pan dzisiaj nadal działa przez życie tych, którzy poświęcili się byciu narzędziami Boga. Być prowadzonym, prowadzonym i namaszczonym przez Jego Ducha Świętego, aby kontynuować służbę Jezusa w dzisiejszym świecie. Teraz Bóg nakazał, aby Jego dzieło zostało wykonane za pomocą ludzkich instrumentów. Nie mówię, że musi być wykonane. Bóg może użyć anielskich istot do swojego dzieła i nadejdzie czas, w czasie Księgi Objawienia, kiedy Bóg użyje aniołów do głoszenia Jego ewangelii ludziom na całym świecie. Objawienie, rozdział 14, „Pierwszy anioł latający po środku nieba, mający wieczną ewangelię” (Ap 14:6). Ale w chwili obecnej Bóg wybrał użycie ludzkich narzędzi. Tak niedoskonałe, jak mogą być, ale to jest to, czego Bóg postanowił użyć. Najciekawsze jest to, że Bóg użyje mnie, a Bóg użyje ciebie. Tyle razy błagamy: "Panie, nie mogę mówić. Nigdy nie byłem w stanie mówić, Panie, ani nawet teraz." Jak Mojżesz próbował odwołać wezwanie Boga. Jeremiasz powiedział: „Panie, jestem tylko dzieckiem, nikt mnie nie posłucha”. I wszyscy mamy swoje wymówki, dlaczego nie możemy być wykorzystani. Czyż nie? Wszyscy znamy powody, dla których Bóg nie mógł nas wykorzystać.<br/>Pewnego razu, gdy Pan wzywał proroka do wykonywania swego dzieła, rzekł: „Panie, poślij, kogo chcesz”. Pan rzekł: „Hej, powołałem cię”. „Panie, dobry pomysł, poślij, kogo chcesz”. Tak często jesteśmy w takiej sytuacji, "Panie, poślij przez rękę kogo chcesz, kogokolwiek oprócz mnie, Panie." A jednak, Bóg polecił nas użyć.<br/>Teraz każdy z nas może pokazać swoje własne niedoskonałości. Każdy z nas może wskazać na własne słabości i każdy z nas może znaleźć wymówkę, dlaczego Bóg nie chciałby mnie wykorzystać. Ale mimo to Bóg wybrał ciebie. Żeby przez twoje życie mógł objawić się światu w potrzebie. Zastanawiasz się, kiedy Bóg ma takie narzędzia do użycia, w jaki sposób kiedykolwiek wykonał tę pracę, prawda?<br/>Aż do dnia, w którym został wzięty, po tym, jak przez Ducha Świętego dał przykazania do apostołów, których wybrał (Dz 1:2):<br/>Tym właśnie zakończył Ewangelię Łukasza. Dzień, w którym Jezus został wzięty na górę, po tym, jak polecił apostołom czekać na obdarzenie władzą.<br/>Do których on również [to jest apostołów on również] objawił się im żywym po jego męki [lub śmierci] przez wielu nieomylnych dowodów (Dz 1:3),<br/>Trudno zaprzeczyć faktowi zmartwychwstania Jezusa Chrystusa. Byłem rozbawiony, a także zdenerwowany i zdenerwowany artykułem, który przeczytałem w Rejestrze Santa Ana w zeszłą sobotę. O nauce o stworzeniu i teoriach ewolucyjnych prezentowanych w szkołach powiatowych. Jak to możliwe, że ten profesor powiedział, że uczy klasę nauki, a więc zajmują się tylko faktami i nie mają miejsca na teorie. Ponieważ nauka opiera się na faktach, a tworzenie opiera się na religijnych przesądach. Potrzeba dużo wiary, aby uwierzyć w teorie religijne. Kiedy masz do czynienia z faktami, możesz je po prostu zaakceptować. Pomyślałem: "Bardzo interesujące w tej klasie nauki, nauczyli mnie, że świat ma cztery miliardy lat. Teraz nauczają, że świat ma dwanaście miliardów lat. Nie tak dawno temu poszedłem do szkoły”.<br/>Interesujące jest to, że Biblia nigdy nie wymagała rewizji ani aktualizacji, aby sprostać aktualnym danym, które odkryli ludzie. A jednak, jeśli weźmiecie dziś moje podręczniki do nauk ścisłych i spróbujecie nauczyć od nich klasy nauk ścisłych, odkryjecie, że wiele rzeczy, które były nauczane jako fakt naukowy, kiedy byłem w liceum, nie są już uznawane za fakty naukowe. Prosta protoplazma komórkowa nie jest już prostą komórką, ale niezwykle złożoną. Jeśli jest jakiś fakt, który można potwierdzić w historii, to fakt zmartwychwstania Jezusa Chrystusa z martwych.<br/>Mamy system orzecznictwa, który opiera się na zeznaniach świadków. Jeśli człowiek jest oskarżony o zbrodnię i są ludzie, którzy byli świadkami tej zbrodni, gdy była popełniona, i są doprowadzeni do standardu, i przysięgają mówić prawdę, całą prawdę i nic poza prawdą, to Bóg im pomoże. I w swoim przesłuchaniu twierdzą, że: "Widziałem tego człowieka w banku w maju dwudziestego trzeciego. Widziałem, jak wyciągnął pistolet z płaszcza. Słyszałem, jak żądał, aby wszystkie pieniądze zostały mu oddane. Widziałem go, gdy wychodził z banku. Widziałem go jako oficera, który go aresztował na zewnątrz." A jeśli zdołasz zmusić trzech lub czterech świadków, aby wskazali na tego człowieka i poddasz ich zeznania przesłuchaniu, ten człowiek zostanie uznany za winnego. To on to zrobił. Mamy dwóch lub trzech świadków, którzy zeznają o tej samej historii o tym człowieku, i przyjmuje się, że to on popełnił przestępstwo i jest winny.<br/>Po śmierci Jezusa, kiedy zmartwychwstał, ukazał się wielu różnym ludziom, którzy zaświadczyli przysięgą, że Go widzieli, że rozmawiali z Nim, że ukazał się im w różnych miejscach w różnych okolicznościach. I przez okres czterdziestu dni odwiedzał ich. I w jednym czasie, aż do pięciuset osób, które były zebrane w jednym miejscu, On ukazał się. Trudno jest po prostu odrzucić lub zaprzeczyć świadectwo tych ludzi. To zdyskredytowanie całego systemu orzecznictwa. Ale nie tylko to, ci ludzie, którzy świadczyli, że widzieli zmartwychwstałego Pana, że rozmawiali z Nim, że jedli z Nim, oni wszyscy, z wyjątkiem jednego, spotkali gwałtowną śmierć z rąk innych ludzi, ponieważ twierdzili, że opowieść, którą opowiedzieli, była prawdą. Mówisz o świadkach, którzy przysięgli mówić prawdę, całą prawdę, tylko prawdę. Jeśli życie człowieka było zagrożone z powodu tego świadka, a to było kłamstwo, przynajmniej jeden z nich złamałby się pod presją. Przyznaliby się do całego oszustwa. "Okazał się żywy po swojej męce przez wiele nieomylnych dowodów."<br/>Widziano ich przez czterdzieści dni, mówiąc do nich o sprawach dotyczących królestwa Bożego (Dz 1:3):<br/>Czasami obwiniamy uczniów za ich pytania o czas królestwa Bożego. Niech się pamięta, że królestwo Boże było ulubionym tematem Jezusa Chrystusa. On zawsze mówił o Królestwie Bożym, i to jest wielka nadzieja, że On zasiał w sercach wszystkich ludzi. Rzeczy nie zawsze pozostaną zepsute, jak są. Świat nie przejdzie na zawsze pod władzą ciemności, pod niewolą zła. Bóg pewnego dnia ustanowi swoje królestwo na ziemi. Królestwo sprawiedliwej radości i pokoju. "Jezus będzie królował tam, gdzie słońce wyruszy w kolejne podróże, a Jego królestwo rozciągnie się od brzegu do brzegu." I ten dzień będzie najchwalebniejszym dniem, jaki świat kiedykolwiek widział, gdy choroby, cierpienia i ból zostaną zniesione w Jego królestwie, jak grzech i chciwość, a te rzeczy, które uczyniły świat tak nieznośnym miejscem, zostaną zniesione w Jego królestwie. Bezbożny komercjalizm, wyzysk człowieka, wszystkie te rzeczy zostały zniesione w Jego chwalebnym królestwie, kiedy rządził. Nic dziwnego, że uczniowie byli niecierpliwi, aby to zrobić. Nie mogę się doczekać, aby to zrobić; nie mogę się doczekać Jego królestwa, które nadejdzie. A Jezus powiedział nam, kiedy się modlimy, pierwszą prośbą jest: „Przyjdź Królestwo Twoje. Niech się stanie wola Twoja na ziemi, jak i w niebie” (Mateusza 6:10). To jest właściwy rodzaj pragnienia, które wszyscy powinniśmy mieć. Pragnę królestwa Bożego. I tak mówił do nich w tym czterdziestodniowym okresie o królestwie.<br/>A zgromadziwszy się z nimi, nakazał im, aby nie odchodzili z Jerozolimy, ale oczekiwali obietnicy Ojca, o której słyszeliście ode Mnie (Dz 1, 4).<br/>Powiedział: „Oto teraz poczekajcie tutaj, w Jerozolimie, aż otrzymacie obietnicę Ojca”. Ta obietnica, o której mówi, jest bez wątpienia obietnicą w Joelu, gdzie Pan obiecał: "I stanie się w dniach ostatecznych, mówi Pan, że wyleję Ducha mego na wszelkie ciało, a synowie i córki wasze będą prorokować, a młodzieńcy wasi będą śnić sny, a starcy wasi będą widzieć wizje. Obietnica Ojca: nadejdzie dzień, kiedy Bóg wyleje swego Ducha na wszelkie ciało, wszystkich wierzących. Każdy otrzyma tę dynamikę od Boga.<br/>Albowiem Jan prawdziwie ochrzczony wodą, ale wy będziecie ochrzczeni Duchem Świętym niewiele dni odtąd (Dz 1, 5).<br/>Jan ochrzcił wodą, zanurzył ludzi w wodzie, "w niewielu dniach zostaniecie zanurzeni w Duchu Świętym".<br/>[6] »A gdy się zebrali, zapytali Go: Panie, czy w tym czasie przywrócisz królestwo Izraelowi?<br/>"Kiedy to nastąpi, Panie? Kiedy nadszedł czas na to przywrócenie?" A Jezus mówi do nich teraz, nie o królestwie, ale o mocy, którą otrzymają za służbę. I tak odkłada na bok ich pytanie.<br/>Mówiąc do nich: To nie do was, aby znać czasy i pory, które Ojciec umieścił we własnej mocy (Dz 1, 7).<br/>"To nie dla ciebie, aby wiedzieć." Żyli nieustannie w oczekiwaniu na natychmiastowe ustanowienie królestwa. Przez całe życie Jezusa oczekiwali, że w każdej chwili wejdzie do budki telefonicznej i wyjdzie jako Zbawiciel świata. Shazzam! Pokazanie swojej mocy i obalenie rządów świata, ustanowienie królestwa Bożego na ziemi. I oni codziennie czekali na tę zmianę, aby się wydarzyć. I za każdym razem, gdy Jezus mówił, że pójdzie do Jerozolimy, zostanie oddany w ręce grzesznego człowieka, a następnie zostanie ukrzyżowany, "Och, och nie, Panie. Nie, nie rozumiesz królestwa, Panie. Bądź tak daleko od Ciebie." Kiedy Jezus umarł na krzyżu, wszyscy byli bardzo rozczarowani.<br/>Dwaj uczniowie w drodze do Emaus, tak smutny. "Hej, ludzie. Jak to możliwe, że jesteś tak smutny, jak chodzisz?" "Co masz na myśli? Musisz być obcy tutaj, jeśli nie wiesz, co się działo ostatnio w Jerozolimie." "Jakich rzeczy?" "Och, człowiek imieniem Jezus z Nazaretu...o człowieku, był potężny i potężny. Pomazanie Boże było nad Jego życiem. Mieliśmy nadzieję, że w Nim jest wyzwolenie Izraela, ale Go ukrzyżowali. Mieliśmy nadzieję... teraz jest martwy." Teraz zmartwychwstał i mówi: „Za kilka dni, bracia, otrzymacie obietnicę Ojca”. „Och, jaka obietnica? Obietnica ustanowienia królestwa?” Widzicie, było słuszne, że pytają. „Czy to Panie? Dobrze! Czy to jest czas? Czy zamierzasz teraz ustanowić swoje królestwo? "Nie. To nie jest dla was, aby znać te czasy, że Ojciec jest wyznaczony, ani że Ojciec ma w swojej mocy. Ale otrzymasz moc, gdy Duch Święty zstąpi na ciebie."<br/>Tutaj grecki przyimek epi jest używany do oznaczania nowej relacji, którą mieli mieć z Duchem Świętym. W Ewangelii według Jana, rozdział 14, jak Jezus jest tam obiecując zesłać Ducha Świętego, On powiedział: "Nie zostawię was bez wytchnienia. Przyjdę do was i pomodlę się do Ojca, a On pośle do was innego pocieszyciela, Ducha Prawdy, którego świat nie może przyjąć, bo Go nie widzi i nie zna, ale Go znacie, bo z wami mieszka i będzie w was” (J 14,17-18). Ten sam grecki przyimek jak nasz, tylko piszą "en" zamiast "w". Dwukrotny związek tam w John: On jest z tobą, ale On będzie mieszkać w tobie. Ale teraz Jezus powiedział, że masz zamiar otrzymać moc, gdy Duch Święty przyjdzie na ciebie. Grecki przyimek epi, który jest tłumaczony w różnych tekstach w całym Nowym Testamencie jako "na" lub "nad" lub lubię to, "przelewów".<br/>W siódmym rozdziale Ewangelii św. Jana czytamy: „Ostatniego dnia, wielkiego dnia święta, kiedy Jezus stał na górze świątynnej i wołał do ludu: „Jeśli ktoś jest spragniony, niech przyjdzie do Mnie i niech pije; a kto pije wodę, którą Ja mu daję, z wnętrza swego wyleje strumienie wody żywej”. Jan powiedział: „To On mówił o Duchu, który jeszcze nie został dany, aby ci, którzy w Niego wierzą, otrzymali” (J 7,37-39). Co mówił o Duchu? Że będzie jak potok wody żywej wypływającej. Podoba mi się: "Kiedy Duch przelewa cię", na ciebie, lub nad tobą, lub przelewa się z ciebie. Tak więc trzy relacje: On jest z tobą przed twoim nawróceniem, On jest tym, który sprawia, że zdajesz sobie sprawę, że jesteś grzesznikiem, On jest tym, który wskazuje na Jezusa Chrystusa jako odpowiedź, gdy przekonuje świat o grzechu, sprawiedliwości i sądzie. W chwili, gdy otworzysz swoje życie i serce na Jezusa Chrystusa i zaprosisz Go, aby wszedł, Duch Święty przychodzi i zaczyna cię zamieszkiwać. On będzie w tobie. „Czyż nie wiecie, że nie jesteście swoimi własnymi, bo jesteście nabyci za cenę, dlatego wysławiajcie Boga w swoim ciele i w swoim duchu, które są Jego? A czyż nie wiecie, że wasze ciało jest świątynią Ducha Świętego, który jest w was? Nie upijcie się winem, w którym jest nadmiar, ale bądźcie nasyceni, albo bądźcie napełnieni Duchem” (1 Kor 6,19-20; Ef 5,18). Ale oto trzeci związek. To jest doświadczenie wzmacniające.<br/>Otrzymacie dynamizm, kiedy Duch Święty zstąpi na was, i będziecie mi świadkami (Dz 1, 8).<br/>I tak dynamika, by być świadkiem Jezusa Chrystusa. Interesujące jest to, że słowo świadka w języku greckim jest słowem martus, skąd pochodzimy nasze słowo męczennik. A w języku greckim oznacza to męczennik. Świadek to ktoś, kto nie tylko głosi to, w co wierzy, żyje tym, w co wierzy, jest tym, w co wierzy, i wierzy w to tak mocno, że w razie potrzeby umrze za to, w co wierzy. Oto jak silna jest jego wiara. Jest martus. Nie boi się umrzeć za to, w co wierzy.<br/>Pamiętacie, kiedy Paweł wracał do Jerozolimy, a Agab przybył z Cezarei i wziął pas Pawła, związał się i powiedział: „Taki jest człowiek, który posiada ten pas, aby go związać, gdy dotrze do Jerozolimy”. Przyjaciele Paula zaczęli płakać, mówiąc: "Och, Paul, nie idź, nie idź". Powiedział: "Co masz na myśli przez te łzy? Myślisz, że mnie odwiedziesz? Myślisz, że martwię się o bycie związanym? Jestem gotów umrzeć." Był martusiem. "Jestem gotów umrzeć." Bycie zabitym za wiarę nie uczyniło cię męczennikiem; ponieważ byłeś męczennikiem, zostałeś zabity. Ponieważ byłeś świadkiem, ponieważ uwierzyłeś w to tak mocno. Więc to nie uczyniło cię świadkiem, tylko udowodniło kim jesteś. Byłeś świadkiem przez cały czas. Gdybyś nie był martusiem, nigdy byś nie poszedł na śmierć. Wyrzekłbyś się; powiedziałbyś: "Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Chwileczkę, zmieńmy kurs. Myślę, że popełniłem błąd." Wtedy mówisz: "Cóż, on nie był martusem. Kradzież konia nie czyni z ciebie złodzieja konia; to tylko dowodzi, że nim byłeś. Nikt nie kradnie konia, chyba że jest złodziejem konia. Tak więc kradzież nie czyni z ciebie złodzieja koni, tylko dowodzi, że byłeś przez cały czas. Bycie męczennikiem tylko dowodzi, że byłeś świadkiem, martusiem. "A wy będziecie świadkami." I czy to nie ciekawe, że większość z nich została męczennikiem? "Świadkowie do Mnie."<br/>Świadectwo miało być zarówno w Jerozolimie, jak i w całej Judei (Dz 1, 8).<br/>Świadkowie zaczęli w domu. Najtrudniejsze miejsce, prawda? Zaczęło się w domu w Jerozolimie, a następnie w okolicach Jerozolimy, w okolicach Judei. A potem miało się rozprzestrzenić na Samarię. A potem wyruszyć w najdalsze krańce świata. I w trakcie studiowania Dziejów Apostolskich zobaczymy ten sam postęp. Jak zaczęło się świadectwo w Jerozolimie. Dowiemy się o tym w następnym rozdziale. A potem zobaczymy, jak zaczęła się rozprzestrzeniać po Judei. A potem Filip wstąpił do Samarii, a następnie Paweł i Barnaba zostali wezwani, aby pójść do najdalszych zakątków świata. I tak świadectwo rozprzestrzeniało się poprzez namaszczenie i umocnienie Ducha Świętego.<br/>Gdy to powiedział, gdy oni patrzyli, został wzięty w górę, a obłok przyjął go z dala od ich oczu (Dz 1, 9).<br/>To jest ostateczna obietnica, którą Jezus dał swoim uczniom. To są ostatnie słowa przed Jego wniebowstąpieniem. Oczywiście, później przyszedł i rozmawiał z Pawłem i innymi, ale przed Jego wniebowstąpieniem jest to Jego ostatnie słowo. A gdy to powiedział, a oni na Niego patrzyli, został podniesiony, a obłok odjął Go od ich oczu.<br/>A gdy patrzyli w niebo, gdy wstępował, oto dwaj mężczyźni stali przy nich w białych szatach (Dz 1, 10).<br/>Zakładamy, że byli aniołami.<br/>Który też rzekł: Mężowie Galilejczycy, dlaczego stoicie i patrzycie w niebo? Ten Jezus, który jest wzięty od was do nieba, tak przyjdzie, jak go widzieliście idącego do nieba (Dz 1, 11).<br/>Widzieli Go, jak wstępuje do nieba i ujrzą Go, gdy przyjdzie ponownie. „Oto idzie Pan z dziesiątkami tysięcy swoich świętych, aby wykonać sąd na ziemi” (Judy 1:14-15). A potem: „Do Tego, który nas umiłował i wydał za nas samego siebie, i który uczynił nas dla Boga naszego królami i kapłanami, którzy z Nim będą królować na ziemi, oto Pan nadchodzi, i ujrzy Go każde oko, a także ci, którzy Go przebili, będą opłakiwać” (Obj. Tak więc Pan przychodzi. Każde oko Go zobaczy. Świadkowie Jehowy mówią, że On już przyszedł, ale to było tajne przyjście. Ponieważ tylko uczniowie widzieli Go odchodzącego, tylko uczniowie Świadków Jehowy widzieli Go powracającego. Lecz Jezus rzekł: „Jeśli wam powiedzą, że przyszedł potajemnie i wszedł do potajemnej komnaty, nie wierzcie” (Mt 24,26).<br/>Ten Jezus, który jest wzięty od was do nieba, przyjdzie tak, jak widzieliście Go wchodzącego do nieba.<br/>Teraz jest bardzo interesujący werset w II Jana, werset Act 1:7 , "Albowiem wielu oszustów weszli na świat, którzy nie wyznają, że Jezus Chrystus przyszedł w ciele." To, niestety, jest słabym tłumaczeniem greckiego. Dla tej partycypacji jest w obecnym czasie i należy przetłumaczyć "przychodzi w ciele". Ci, którzy będą zaprzeczać, że Jezus Chrystus przychodzi w ciele. Co Jan mówi o nich? "Oni są oszustem i antychryst. Patrzcie na siebie, abyśmy nie stracili tego, co uczyniliśmy, ale otrzymali pełną nagrodę. Kto bowiem przestępuje i nie trwa w nauce Chrystusowej, nie ma Boga. Kto trwa w nauce Chrystusowej, ma zarówno Ojca, jak i Syna. A jeśli ktoś przyjdzie do drzwi waszych (w sobotę rano), a nie przyniesie tej nauki, nie przyjmuje go do domu i nie żegna się z nim. Bo ten, kto się z nim żegna, jest uczestnikiem jego złych uczynków" (2Jn 1:7-11). Zadaj im jedno pytanie: "Czy Jezus przychodzi w ciele?" Po prostu zadaj im to pytanie. A jeśli oni mówią nie, po prostu pamiętaj, co Jan cię ostrzegł i co Jan powiedział. "Jeśli ktoś nie wyznaje, że Jezus Chrystus przychodzi w ciele." Czy pamiętasz, kiedy był z uczniami i powiedział: "Daj mi coś do jedzenia?" On powiedział: "Wiesz, duchy nie jedzą; dotknij mnie. Widzisz? To ja." Tak więc ten sam Jezus przychodzi ponownie w ten sam sposób, w jaki widzieli Go idącego do nieba. A ja, dla jednego, wierzę, że przyjście jest bardzo szybkie.<br/>I wrócili się do Jerozolimy z góry zwanej Oliwną, która jest od Jerozolimy drogą szabatową. A gdy weszli, weszli do górnej izby, gdzie mieszkali zarówno Piotr, i Jakub, i Jan, i Andrzej, i Filip, i Tomasz, i Bartłomiej, i Mateusz, i Jakub, syn Alfeusza, i Szymon Zelota, i Judasz, brat Jakuba. A to wszystko trwało w jednej zgodzie w modlitwie i błaganiu, z kobietami i z Maryją, matką Jezusa, i z Jego braćmi (Dz 1, 12-14).<br/>Jest to ostatnia wzmianka o Maryi, matce Jezusa. W tym momencie i od tego momentu nie ma już żadnej wzmianki o niej w Dziejach Apostolskich ani w listach. Żadnej wzmianki o jej śmierci ani o jej cudownym wniebowstąpieniu, bez śmierci. Nic nie jest wspomniane w Piśmie Świętym. Jest milczeniem.<br/>Jego bracia prawdopodobnie odnosiliby się do Jakuba i Judy oraz do innych braci, którzy byli synami Józefa i Marii.<br/>Górna sala – są tacy, którzy mówią, że jest to ta sama górna sala, w której Jezus miał Ostatnią Wieczerzę ze swoimi uczniami. A jednak są inni, którzy trzymają się tej górnej sali jako sali na terenie świątyni, gdzie spotkał się wczesny kościół. Wybór należy do ciebie.<br/>I w tych dniach Piotr wstał pośród uczniów, i powiedział, (liczba ich imion razem było około stu dwadzieścia), ludzie i bracia, to Pismo musi być wypełnione, które Duch Święty przez usta Dawida powiedział przed o Judasza, który był przewodnikiem dla tych, którzy wzięli Jezusa (Dz 1:15-16).<br/>Tu znowu, Piotr wciąż jest tym samym popędliwym sobą. Czekają w modlitwie i błaganiu, a Peter wstaje i mówi: "Przyjaciele, jest werset, który musi się spełnić." I wiecie, że on pójdzie naprzód, "Zacznijmy program, rzucajmy losy i dowiedzmy się, kto zastąpi Judasza." Czuję, że Piotr był znowu w ciele, manifestując tę nagłą naturę, która należała do niego. I myślę, że przyszła historia kościoła w Księdze Dziejów Apostolskich wskazuje na to. Interesuje mnie zrozumienie Pisma Świętego przez Piotra, jak cytuje z tylu miejsc w Starym Testamencie. Piotr przejawia bardzo wielkie zrozumienie Pisma Starego Testamentu, co jest punktem na jego korzyść.<br/>Zauważ, że Piotr przypisuje Duchowi Świętemu te rzeczy, które Dawid napisał. Tak, "Całe Pismo jest dane z natchnienia Bożego" (2Tm 3:16) . Nie jest częścią Pisma. Bo jeśli mówisz mi, że część Pisma Świętego jest natchniona przez Boga, to muszę cię zapytać: „Jakie części są natchnione, a które nie są natchnione?” A potem ty jesteś autorytetem, który mówi mi, w którą część mogę wierzyć, a w którą nie mogę wierzyć, a w chwili, gdy Bóg nie jest już autorytetem, ale ty jesteś autorytetem, jestem w tarapatach. Strzeżcie się tych, którzy mówią: "Zaprawdę, nie możecie wierzyć we wszystkie Pisma!" - a same Pisma mówią: "Wszystkie Pisma są natchnione przez Boga." A tutaj, Łukasz na piśmie o tym, co mówił Piotr, oświadcza, że Dawid był rzeczywiście rzecznikiem Ducha Świętego. Duch Święty, przez usta Dawida, mówił o Judaszu.<br/>Albowiem on był z nami liczony, [był jednym z Dwunastu] otrzymał część tej posługi. Ale teraz ten człowiek kupił pole za zapłatę za nieprawość; i upadł głową (Dz 1:17-18),<br/>Kupił pole, pole garncarza, jak mówi Zachariasz w jedenastym rozdziale.<br/>I upadł na głowę, rozerwał się na strzępy, a wszystkie jego wnętrzności wytrysnęły (Dz 1,18).<br/>Są tacy, którzy znaleźli rozbieżności w Piśmie Świętym, ponieważ w jednej z Ewangelii powiedziano nam, że kiedy Judasz wrócił i próbował zwrócić pieniądze, powiedzieli: "Hej, to twój problem. Nie możemy go wziąć." I umieścić go z powrotem w skarbcu świątyni. "To pieniądze krwi." Następnie rzucił je tam na podłodze świątyni i wyszedł i powiesił się. Tutaj Piotr mówi nam, że upadł na głowę i po prostu wyskoczył. A są tacy, którzy wyobrażają sobie rozbieżność. Bardzo proste, wszedł na drzewo, by się powiesić, przywiązał linę do szyi, przywiązał ją do kończyny i skoczył. A siła upadku albo zerwała linę, albo zerwała mu głowę, i spadł w dół do kanionu i tak jak powiedział tutaj.<br/>Było to znane wszystkim mieszkańcom Jerozolimy, tak że pole nazywa się w ich języku Akeldama, to znaczy pole krwi. Albowiem jest napisane w księdze Psalmów: Niech jego mieszkanie będzie spustoszone, i niech nikt nie mieszka w nim; i, Jego biskupstwo niech inny wziąć (Dz 1:19-20).<br/>Teraz w rzeczywistości on cytuje z dwóch różnych Psalmów tutaj. Z Psalmów 69:25 ,Składa to razem z Psalmów 109:8 . I łącząc te dwa znajduje te proroctwa dotyczące Judasza.<br/>Dlatego ci mężczyźni (Dz 1, 21)<br/>Teraz tutaj szukają kogoś, kto zajmie miejsce Judasza, aby zostać apostołem. Oto kwalifikacje, których szukali w tamtym czasie.<br/>Dlatego z tych ludzi, którzy towarzyszyli nam przez cały czas, że Pan Jezus, gdy wchodził i wychodził między nas (Dz 1:21),<br/>Pamiętacie, że było wielu uczniów, z których wielu Jezus wybrał dziesięciu na apostołów. A słowo apostoł oznacza „jeden, który jest wysłany”. Albo wybrał dwunastu na apostołów, więc wysłał dwunastu. Liczba ludzkich rządów. "Mamy tylko jedenastu. Potrzebujemy jednego, aby zająć miejsce Judasza, ale potrzebujemy jednego, który był z nami przez cały czas od początku z Jezusem."<br/>Od czasu, gdy został ochrzczony przez Jana, aż do dnia, w którym został wzięty z nas, jeden musi być wyświęcony, aby być świadkiem jego zmartwychwstania (Dz 1:22).<br/>Tak więc były to wymagania, których szukali. Ktoś, kto był w pobliżu przez cały ten czas. Od czasu chrztu Jana do wniebowstąpienia. I ten, kto widział zmartwychwstałego Pana, i w ten sposób mógł znieść fakt zmartwychwstania, ich świadectwo tego faktu.<br/>Teraz Paweł apostoł, później twierdząc, że jest apostołem, powiedział: „Czyż nie widziałem zmartwychwstałego Chrystusa?” Najwyraźniej był to jeden z wymogów apostolstwa. Ktoś zapytał mnie: „Czy są dzisiaj apostołowie?” Cóż, nie wiem. Nie sądzę, że istnieją w tym samym sensie, co w Nowym Testamencie. Z pewnością nie ma dziś nikogo, kto może świadczyć o zmartwychwstaniu tak jak oni.<br/>I wyznaczyli dwóch, Józefa zwanego Barsabas, który miał na imię Justus, i Matthias. I modlili się, i powiedzieli: Ty, Panie, który znasz serca wszystkich ludzi, pokaż, czy z tych dwóch, które wybrałeś (Dz 1:23-24)<br/>Myślę, że często popełniamy ten błąd, dając Panu dwa wybory, oba błędne. Ograniczając Boga, widzisz. Jesteśmy tak skłonni do tego. Oczywiście, Paweł był wyborem Boga. Peter był podekscytowany i odparł: "Hej, musimy coś zrobić, wiesz, musimy pomóc Bogu. Wiesz, jeden zaginął i musimy go wypełnić." A jednak: "Boże, którego z tych dwóch chcesz?" I dał Bogu dwa wybory.<br/>Żeby mógł wziąć udział w tej posłudze i w tym apostolstwie, z którego upadł Judasz przez przestępstwo, aby mógł iść na swoje miejsce. I tak rozdali swoje losy (Dz 1:25-26 );<br/>Interesujący sposób, w jaki starali się określić wolę Boga. Rzućmy kostkami, dowiedzmy się, jaka jest wola Boga. Interesujące dla mnie są różne sposoby, które ludzie wymyślili, aby rozpoznać wolę Boga. W czasach Starego Testamentu mieli ciekawy sposób przyjścia do kapłana, który pytał Pana o nich przez Urim i Thummim, "światła i doskonałości". Dokładnie czym byli ci Urim i Thummim, nie wiemy. Jestem pewien, że nie były to kolorowe okulary, które Józef Smith znalazł ze Złotymi Tablicami; magiczne okulary, że kiedy je założysz, możesz nagle przeczytać hieroglificzny napis.<br/>Są tacy, którzy mówią, że Urim i Thummim były w rzeczywistości czarno-białym kamieniem, który nosił się w torebce na piersi kapłana. Będą się modlić i zadawać Panu konkretne pytanie. Pamiętasz, że Dawid zadawał Panu jednoznaczne pytania: Panie, czy mamy wyruszyć przeciwko Filistynom? Odpowiedź brzmiała: Nie! A dnia następnego: Panie, czy mamy wyruszyć przeciwko Filistynom? Odpowiedź brzmiała: Tak. Kiedy pójdziemy? Zadawali konkretne pytania, a Pan prowadził ich przez Urim i Thummin. Mówią, że kapłan modliłby się, szukał Boga, a następnie sięgnął i wyciągnął jeden z dwóch kamieni. Jeśli to był biały kamień, to była odpowiedź tak. Gdyby to było "nie", to byłby to czarny kamień, który by wyciągnął. Niektórzy nawet mówią, że otrzymujemy termin "czarna kula" od tego Urim i Thummim. Właściwie, w oryginale jest to nie głosowanie przeciwko konkretnemu projektowi lub idei. Nie wiemy, czym byli Urim i Thummim, ale w okresie Starego Testamentu używali metody rzucania losów, aby określić wolę Boga.<br/>Więc tutaj uczniowie podnoszą to samo, co rzucają kostkami, aby zobaczyć, który z dwóch kolegów, których Bóg wybrał na miejsce Judasza Iskarioty.<br/>los spadł na Matthias; był on zliczony z jedenastu (Dz 1:26).<br/>Teraz, kto w świecie jest Matthias? Nikt nigdy nie słyszał o nim wcześniej lub później. To będzie interesujące, aby spotkać się z Matthias i dowiedzieć się, kim jest i co zrobił. Myślę, że z późniejszej historii, to jest oczywiste, aby założyć, że Bóg wybrał Paul jako apostoł. Paweł oświadcza to sam. Teraz jest to ostatni raz, gdy czytamy, że starają się rozróżnić wolę Bożą przez rzucanie losów lub przez przypadek czegoś.<br/>Znam dziś człowieka, który, starając się rozeznać wolę Pana, będzie się modlił i zadał Panu pytanie. Będzie miał dziesięć groszy w kieszeni, a gdy się modli, weźmie je z zamkniętymi oczami i położy na stole, a jeśli wszystkie pojawią się z głową, to tak. Co ciekawe, od czasu do czasu wszyscy przychodzą do głowy, co jest całkiem niezłym prawdopodobieństwem. Jednak po dacie Ducha Świętego nie znajdujemy żadnego wzoru. Gdy Duch Święty przyszedł na kościół, wtedy Duch Święty zaczął do nich mówić i kierować nimi. A Duch Święty powiedział: "Oddzielcie mi Pawła i Barnabę do posługi, do której ich powołałem" ( Dz 13:2 ). I Duch Święty ich wysłał. Więc znajdujemy kościół bardziej bezpośrednio prowadzony przez Ducha Świętego. Kiedy Duch Święty przyszedł, to rzucanie kostkami, aby dowiedzieć się, wola Boża została odłożona na bok.<br/>"<br/><br/>Wersja króla Jakuba<br/><br/>Jest to Biblia Króla Jakuba z 1769 roku (znana również jako Autoryzowana Biblia). „Domena publiczna” |

In fact, dynamic drivers work exactly the same as dynamic microphones but in reverse. Inside a dynamic driver there is a magnet, and when you plug in the headphones, you are sending a AC current through it which will turn the voice coil into a magnet. Depending on the direction of the current, the polarity of the magnet will change. Now since we know for a magnet, same charges repels and different charges attract, we know that the voice coil will move back and forth depending on it's polarity at the time. The voice coil is attached to the diaphragm which will then move back and forth creating a sound wave. The same occurs in reverse, if you move a coil through a magnet you produce a current instead. Since your voice is pushing the diaphragm, it is moving the voice coil back and forth generating the current you have observed.<br/><br/>100+ Head-Fier<br/><br/>Joined:<br/>Nov 7, 2011<br/><br/>Posts:<br/>134<br/><br/>Likes: 55<br/><br/>Exactly.

To samo dzieje się w odwrotnej kolejności, jeśli przesuniesz cewkę przez magnes, zamiast tego wytwarzasz prąd.

Stalin's opposition within the party, including Bukharin, Yagoda and Rykov were purged in these show trials, as Stalin manipulatively forced them to confess to crimes of planning a coup and opposing the state, even if there was no proof. Gabor T Rittersporn said, "Many of the victims were sincerely devoted to the principles of Bolshevism." This amplifies proof that the Bolshevik ideals that had once been the roots of the Communist Party were being disarranged and destroyed by the Purges. The party was depleted and former members helplessly watched Stalin use the great purge as a tool to transform Russia from a one party state to an unchallenged dictatorship. Again, the purges were shattering the framework of the Communist Party, formed during the Bolshevik revolution. This agrees with the "Stalin the executioner" source as both show the manipulative character, that helped the dictator to enhance his grip on Russia's throat.<br/>The manipulative manner, with which Stalin incriminated his targeted opposition during the purges, in the eyes of everyday Russians, also had an implosive impact on Soviet Society. Stalin was able to collect support from the people through his use of propaganda and the media to help him develop a "cult of personality" and the image of a heroic and brave leader. Through this support Stalin implanted mistrust into the minds of the people, convincing them that traitors of the revolution and what he described as 'enemies of the people', were amongst them.

Opozycja Stalina w partii, w tym Bucharin, Jagoda i Rykow zostali oczyszczeni w tych procesach pokazowych, ponieważ Stalin manipulacyjnie zmusił ich do przyznania się do zbrodni planowania zamachu stanu i sprzeciwu wobec państwa, nawet jeśli nie było dowodów. Gabor T. Rittersporn powiedział: "Wiele ofiar było szczerze oddanych zasadom bolszewizmu". To wzmacnia dowód, że bolszewickie ideały, które kiedyś były korzeniami Partii Komunistycznej, zostały zdezorganizowane i zniszczone przez czystki. Partia została wyczerpana, a byli członkowie bezradnie obserwowali, jak Stalin używa wielkiej czystki jako narzędzia do przekształcenia Rosji z jednopartyjnego państwa w niekwestionowaną dyktaturę. Ponownie czystki rozbijały ramy Partii Komunistycznej, utworzonej podczas rewolucji bolszewickiej.

| Supercell is nerfing brawlers instead of nerfing star powers. I was at 750 last season with power 8 nita and it is very tough to go past that, like, star powers play a really dominant role. The matchmaking is also trash. When i play gem grab(around 600 trophies), there are often matchups where the enemy team has one more player than us who is maxed and it's not even that we have a lvl 9 to compete versus that. Sometimes there are even matchups where the enemy team is fully maxed and none of us are. this is why i dont play brawl stars seriously anymore. It's not even like there arent many players who are not maxed and around 600 trophies. It's annoying.<br/>Edit: I think supercell should have at least a basic mechanism that takes the average of levels of brawlers when setting up matches.<br/><br/>Except trophies don't really indicate your skill. They indicate the skill of the teammates you are placed with. And I'm fine with playing against higher level brawlers, but when one team is all level 10 and the other team isn't, clearly it's unbalanced.<br/><br/>I reccomend getting some good friends to play with, me and 2 friends got my friends power 1 tick to rank 28 by playing gem grab with a certain composition all day and we made it without a single one of us being maxed with our brawlers.<br/><br/>I Know how you feel I used to have brawlers in high trophies with low level and it's to difficult to go more further and everything I was saying to myself "I want to have star powers" really supercell needs to make balance to the star powers or at least make a better matchmaking system.<br/><br/>I kinda feel this. I ain't as good at the game as you, but I got Emz to 500 at power 1 and the matchmaking was horrible. Maxed out players everywhere! And it didn't help that the majority of my teammates had around 5-8k trophies... I had to resort to solo showdown last minute because I can either ambush unsuspecting players or simply play a little aggressive at the right times. But I really wish that it could be a bit easier for people who want to push brawlers to really high trophy ranges without having the luxury of star powers.<br/><br/>Altho spike is still good without curveball. Curveball was just a help for hitting your shots more often as spike. But even before curveball was released, spike was a really strong brawler, so he will remain the same now.<br/><br/>I agree that they should have nerfed ambush, but I think they are trying to balance both Snappy Sniping and Ambush, as they are both getting merged with this change. She was becoming a little powerful, but still not nerf-worthy<br/><br/>I'm not sure about this, but now that Darryl got a noticeable buff, looking at their new stats, it looks like Darryl might overshadow Bull, as not only he can always deal more damage than Bull, he won't die as early anymore, so their survivability will be similar without star power (although Bull's survivability is still noticeably better than Darryl's if he had Tough Guy). Not only that, Darryl's super can auto regenerate, meaning Darryl MIGHT be able to be played effectively both as a heavyweight AND an assassin at the same time (before he sucks as a heavyweight but decent as an assassin)<br/><br/>But hes overrated af. And you get trophies with him really easily. So im kinda ok with the nerf. I havent even played him since when I got him to 500 (around 5 months ago), so not that I care that much either.<br/><br/>Why doesn't Poco/Penny get a HP nerf, if they are Marksman/Healer respectively not a tank?<br/>Why isn't Rosa's tankyness nerfed, cough 70% damage reduction?<br/>Why is Tick allowed to have the highest range and the most free pokedamage in the entire game?<br/>Why doesn't Leon get a HP/Damage buff?<br/><br/>Be that as it may, it was Ambush that was OP, not base Piper. I would argue that Ambush is the best star power in the game (now even more so since the percentage of damage increase indirectly went up) and base Piper was a bottom-10 brawler.<br/><br/>What Supercell should do is revert both nerfs, reduce Ambush to 600, and reduce Snappy Sniping to 0.25 since it'd be indirectly buffed by the base damage buff.<br/><br/>Yea and I believe they went a bit too far with Rosa, because now she is basically the better bull now when it comes to tanking, which she has been for a while. Now, Darryl might as well be a smaller, more powerful bull<br/><br/>Why? I feel she needs a buff in almost everything except her star power. Her health and speed make her super a bit more difficult to use, because she can die pretty easily, and it is really difficult for her to trap faster brawlers like Crow. Her star power is a bit broken though... | Supercell denerwuje walczących zamiast denerwujących gwiazd. Byłem w zeszłym sezonie na 750 z mocą 8 nita i bardzo trudno jest przejść przez to, że, jakby gwiazdy odgrywają naprawdę dominującą rolę. Matchmaking jest również śmieci. Kiedy gram w łapanie klejnotów (około 600 trofeów), często zdarzają się mecze, w których drużyna wroga ma jednego gracza więcej niż my, a nawet nie mamy lvl 9, aby rywalizować z tym. Czasami zdarzają się nawet mecze, w których drużyna wroga jest w pełni zmaksymalizowana, a nikt z nas nie jest. Dlatego nie gram już poważnie w gwiazdy bójki. Nie ma nawet wielu graczy, którzy nie są zmaksymalizowani i około 600 trofeów. To irytujące.<br/>Edytuj: Myślę, że superkomórka powinna mieć przynajmniej podstawowy mechanizm, który bierze średnią poziomów brawlerów podczas ustawiania meczów.<br/><br/>Poza tym, że trofea tak naprawdę nie wskazują na twoje umiejętności. Wskazują one na umiejętności kolegów z drużyny, z którymi jesteś umieszczony. I nie mam nic przeciwko graniu przeciwko walczącym na wyższych poziomach, ale kiedy jedna drużyna jest na poziomie 10, a druga nie jest, wyraźnie jest to niezrównoważone.<br/><br/>Zalecam zdobycie dobrych przyjaciół do zabawy, ja i 2 przyjaciele otrzymali moi przyjaciele moc 1 kleszcz do rangi 28, grając klejnot chwytając z pewną kompozycją przez cały dzień i zrobiliśmy to bez jednego z nas jest maxed z naszych brawlerów.<br/><br/>Wiem, jak się czujesz, kiedy miałem brawlerów w wysokich trofeach z niskim poziomem i trudno jest pójść dalej i wszystko, co mówiłem do siebie "Chcę mieć moce gwiazd" naprawdę superkomórka musi zrównoważyć moce gwiazd lub przynajmniej zrobić lepszy system dobierania.<br/><br/>Trochę to czuję. Nie jestem tak dobry w grze jak ty, ale dostałem Emza do 500 na mocy 1 i dobieranie było okropne. Maksymalizowano graczy wszędzie! I to nie pomogło, że większość moich kolegów z drużyny miała około 5-8 tys. trofeów... Musiałem uciekać się do solowej walki w ostatniej chwili, ponieważ mogę albo zasadzić niczego nie podejrzewających graczy, albo po prostu grać trochę agresywnie w odpowiednim czasie. Ale naprawdę chciałbym, aby to było nieco łatwiejsze dla ludzi, którzy chcą popchnąć brawlerów do naprawdę wysokich zakresów trofeów bez posiadania luksusu gwiazd.<br/><br/>Altho spike jest nadal dobry bez krzywej. Curveball był po prostu pomocny w uderzaniu strzałów częściej jak spike. Ale jeszcze przed wypuszczeniem krzywej, spike był naprawdę silnym wojownikiem, więc teraz pozostanie tym samym.<br/><br/>Zgadzam się, że powinni byli zdenerwować zasadzkę, ale myślę, że próbują zrównoważyć zarówno Snappy Sniping, jak i Ambush, ponieważ oba są połączone z tą zmianą. Stawała się trochę potężna, ale nadal nie jest warta nerwów<br/><br/>Nie jestem tego pewien, ale teraz, gdy Darryl ma zauważalnego bufa, patrząc na ich nowe statystyki, wygląda na to, że Darryl może zacienić Bulla, ponieważ nie tylko zawsze może zadać więcej szkód niż Bull, ale nie umrze tak szybko, więc ich przetrwanie będzie podobne bez mocy gwiazd (chociaż przetrwanie Bulla jest nadal zauważalnie lepsze niż T Guy'a). Nie tylko to, super Darryl może automatycznie się regenerować, co oznacza, że Darryl Mógłby być skutecznie grany zarówno jako zabójca wagi ciężkiej, jak i w tym samym czasie (zanim ssie jako zabójca wagi ciężkiej, ale przyzwoity jako zabójca)<br/><br/>Ale on jest przereklamowany af. I można dostać trofea z nim naprawdę łatwo. Więc im trochę ok z nerwem. Nie grałem go nawet od kiedy dostałem go do 500 (około 5 miesięcy temu), więc nie że dbam o to, że też.<br/><br/>Dlaczego Poco/Penny nie dostanie nerwu HP, jeśli są odpowiednio Marksman/Healer, a nie czołg?<br/>Dlaczego Rosa nie zmniejszyła obrażeń od kaszlu o 70%?<br/>Dlaczego Tick może mieć najwyższy zasięg i najwięcej darmowych pokedamage w całej grze?<br/>Dlaczego Leon nie kupuje HP/Damage buffa?<br/><br/>Niezależnie od tego, to Ambush był OP, a nie baza Piper. Twierdzę, że Ambush jest najlepszą gwiazdą w grze (teraz jeszcze bardziej, ponieważ odsetek wzrostu obrażeń pośrednio wzrósł), a baza Piper była dolną 10 wojowniczką.<br/><br/>To, co Supercell powinien zrobić, to odwrócić oba nerwy, zredukować Ambush do 600 i zredukować Snappy Sniping do 0,25, ponieważ zostanie pośrednio zniszczony przez podstawowy buff obrażeń.<br/><br/>Tak i myślę, że posunęli się trochę za daleko z Rosą, ponieważ teraz jest w zasadzie lepszym bykiem, jeśli chodzi o tankowanie, którym była od jakiegoś czasu. Teraz Darryl może być mniejszym, silniejszym bykiem<br/><br/>Dlaczego? Czuję, że potrzebuje buffa prawie we wszystkim, z wyjątkiem jej gwiazdowej mocy. Jej zdrowie i szybkość sprawiają, że jest nieco trudniejsza w użyciu, ponieważ może umrzeć dość łatwo, a jej naprawdę trudno jest złapać szybszych wojowników, takich jak Crow. Jej moc gwiazdy jest nieco złamana, choć... |

| Self-Employment Part 1<br/><br/>When you accept an employment in any organisation, you have to perform various jobs as per the requirements of your employer and you may get a fixed amount of income as salary. You may run a small retail shop, tailoring shop, restaurant, bakery and confectionery, beauty salon, etc. in your locality. You may get engaged in trading or manufacturing on a small scale or providing some service for a price. Such economic activities are known as self-employment.<br/><br/>Meaning of Self-Employment<br/><br/>Earning is necessary for a living. Our father, mother, brothers, sisters and others may be engaged in different economic activities through which they earn their livelihood. These persons are engaged in an economic activity which is termed as wage employment or paid employment. But there are many persons who engage themselves in an occupation or some business which they start and manage on their own. They put in their best effort and take all types of risks to pursue their careers successfully. The entire earning of their work goes to them. All of us have seen small grocery shops, tailoring shops, medical stores etc. in our locality. These are owned and managed by a person, with or without the help of some assistants. Their economic activities are termed as self-employment. So, when an individual engages in any economic activity and manages it on his own, it is known as self-employment.<br/><br/>Objectives<br/><br/>After studying this lesson, you will be able to:<br/><br/>Image of Objectives<br/><br/>Image of Objectives<br/><br/>Characteristics of Self-Employment<br/><br/>It involves ownership and management of activities by a person although he/she may take the help of one or two persons to assist him/her. Thus, self-employment may provide employment to other persons as well.<br/><br/>The earning from self-employment is not fixed. It depends on the income one can earn by producing or buying and selling goods or providing services to others at a price.<br/><br/>In self-employment, the owner alone has to take the profit and bear the risk of loss. So, we find a direct link between the effort and reward in self-employment.<br/><br/>It requires some amount of capital investment, although it may be small.<br/><br/>In self-employment, a person is free to take decisions in respect of running his business profitably and avail of any opportunity that may come up for expansion of his business. It gives complete freedom to work as per one's own will and within the parameters of the prevailing laws.<br/><br/>Thus, self-employment may be defined as, an economic activity which one may perform on his own as a gainful occupation, and this may consist of producing and selling goods, buying and selling goods, or rendering services for a price. | Samozatrudnienie część 1<br/><br/>Kiedy przyjmujesz pracę w dowolnej organizacji, musisz wykonywać różne zadania zgodnie z wymaganiami pracodawcy i możesz otrzymać stałą kwotę dochodu jako wynagrodzenie.
