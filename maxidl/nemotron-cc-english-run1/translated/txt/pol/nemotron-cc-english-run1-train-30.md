Undocumented migrants have nothing. They are not allowed to work. They have no right to state benefits nor to a place to live. They are unseen and potentially the most vulnerable group in the UK today.<br/><br/>Undocumented (or irregular) migrants include those trafficked into the sex trade or for domestic servitude; they include visa overstayers; those whose asylum applications have been refused and others who have been subject to failures in the immigration system. All of these may originally have come to the UK legally.<br/><br/>'Illegal immigrants' – those imagined to have entered the country in the backs of lorries – make up a small proportion of the undocumented.<br/><br/>Indeed some sources suggest that half the estimated 120,000 undocumented children in the UK were actually born here to undocumented parents. These children are disadvantaged from birth, solely by their immigration status.<br/><br/>The blog tells the stories of the undocumented. It highlights their daily struggles and vulnerabilities, but also their strength and resilience. It's not an easy read.<br/><br/>You can access the blog via our website (bottom of right hand column on Home Page).<br/><br/>The blog has won the online category of the Speaking Together media awards. The awards were a new addition this year to the Migrant and Refugee Woman of the Year Awards celebration at the Royal Festival Hall in London as part of International Women's Day. The panel of judges – including novelist and playwright Gillian Slovo, and journalist and author, Hannah Pool – was particularly looking for work that challenged myths and stereotypes.<br/><br/>The blog has also won the Blog North Awards 2013 in the Best Writing category and was also shortlisted for an Amnesty International Media Award. | Nawigacja<br/><br/>"Life Without Papers" zdobył nagrodę za najlepszy scenariusz<br/><br/>Projekt bloga „Życie bez dokumentów”, stworzony przez Len Grant, zawiera historie rodzin imigrantów bez dokumentów i młodych ludzi. Migranci bez dokumentów nie mają nic. Nie mogą pracować. Nie mają prawa do świadczeń państwowych ani do miejsca do życia. Są niewidoczną i potencjalnie najbardziej narażoną grupą w Wielkiej Brytanii.<br/><br/>Nieudokumentowani (lub nielegalni) imigranci obejmują tych, którzy byli przemyceni do handlu seksualnego lub do niewoli domowej; obejmują one osoby przekraczające staż wizowy; tych, których wnioski o azyl zostały odrzucone i innych, którzy byli przedmiotem niepowodzeń w systemie imigracyjnym. Wszystko to mogło pierwotnie przybyć do Wielkiej Brytanii legalnie.<br/><br/>„Nielegalni imigranci” – ci, którzy przypuszczalnie wjechali do kraju na grzbiecie ciężarówek – stanowią niewielką część osób nieudokumentowanych.<br/><br/>Rzeczywiście, niektóre źródła sugerują, że połowa z szacowanych 120 000 nieudokumentowanych dzieci w Wielkiej Brytanii urodziła się tutaj nieudokumentowanym rodzicom. Te dzieci są od urodzenia niekorzystne, wyłącznie ze względu na ich status imigracyjny.<br/><br/>Blog opowiada historie nieudokumentowanych. Podkreśla ich codzienne zmagania i słabości, ale także ich siłę i odporność.

| Sabbath School Lesson<br/><br/>In Galatians, Paul tackles issues such as freedom, the role of the law in salvation, our condition in Christ, and the nature of the Spirit-led life, as well as the age-old question, How can sinful humans be made right before a holy and just God?<br/><br/>Many scholars believe that Galatians may be the earliest of Paul's letters. It was written in A.D. 49, shortly after the famous Jerusalem Council (Acts 15). Therefore, the book may be the oldest Christian document known. As Acts and Galatians make clear, the early church found itself in a fierce battle over the nature of salvation, especially in the case of Gentiles. According to a group of Jewish believers, known as Judaizers, belief in Jesus alone was not good enough for Gentiles. Gentiles must also be circumcised and follow the laws of Moses (Acts 15:1).<br/><br/>This quarter's Bible study guide invites us to journey with the apostle Paul as he pleads with the Galatians to remain true to Jesus. It also gives us a chance to reflect on our own understanding of the truths that opened the way for Martin Luther's ultimate break with Rome and the restoration of the biblical gospel. | Sabat Szkoła Lekcja<br/><br/>W Liście do Galatów Paweł zajmuje się takimi kwestiami, jak wolność, rola prawa w zbawieniu, nasz stan w Chrystusie i natura życia kierowanego przez Ducha, a także odwieczne pytanie: Jak grzeszni ludzie mogą być uczynieni prawymi przed świętym i sprawiedliwym Bogiem?<br/><br/>Wielu uczonych uważa, że List do Galatów może być najwcześniejszym z listów Pawła. Został napisany w 49 AD, wkrótce po słynnym Soborze Jerozolimskim (Dz 15). Dlatego książka może być najstarszym znanym dokumentem chrześcijańskim. Jak wyjaśniają Dzieje Apostolskie i Galacjan, wczesny Kościół znalazł się w zaciętej walce o naturę zbawienia, zwłaszcza w przypadku pogan. Według grupy żydowskich wierzących, znanych jako Judaizers, wiara w Jezusa nie była wystarczająco dobra dla pogan. Poganie również muszą być obrzezani i przestrzegać praw Mojżesza (Dzieje 15:1).<br/><br/>Przewodnik po studium Biblii w tym kwartale zaprasza nas do podróży z apostołem Pawłem, który błaga Galatów, aby pozostali wierni Jezusowi. Daje nam to również okazję do refleksji nad własnym zrozumieniem prawd, które otworzyły drogę do ostatecznego zerwania Marcina Lutra z Rzymem i przywrócenia biblijnej ewangelii. |

Tak wielu poetów i artystów spędzało tam swój czas, że Hildburghausen otrzymał przydomek Klein-Weimar, kiedy ostatni książę Saksonii-Gotha-Altenburg zmarł bez problemu w 1825 r., Pozostałe gałęzie domu zdecydowały się na reorganizację książąt Ernestynów. 12 listopada 1826 roku Fryderyk został księciem Saksonii-Altenburgii, któremu w 1831 roku dał pierwsze prawo podstawowe, w zamian za media związane z Fryderykiem, księciem Saksonii-Altenburgii w Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>Fryderyk I (książę Saksonii-Altenburgii)<br/>- Nie.<br/>Fryderyka<br/><br/>- 15.<br/>Charlotte Georgine Mecklenburg-Strelitz<br/>- Nie.<br/>Charlotte Georgine urodziła się w Hanowerze, elektorat Brunszwik-Lüneburg. Była najstarszym dzieckiem i córką Karola II, wielkiego księcia Meklemburgii, Charlotte i jej siostry, królowa Ludwika Pruska, królowa Fryderyka Hanowerska i księżniczka Teresa z Thurn und Taxis, były uważane za najpiękniejsze kobiety swoich czasów. Jean Paul Friedrich Richter poświęcił swoją powieść Tytan do czterech pięknych, Charlotte dorastał w Hanowerze, gdzie jej ojciec służył jako gubernator, w imieniu jego szwagra, króla Jerzego III Wielkiej Brytanii, który mieszkał w Londynie. Gdy Charlotte miała dwanaście lat, jej matka zmarła i została wychowana przez siostrę jej matki, Charlotte, która poślubiła jej ojca w 1784 roku, a jej siostry zostały przywiezione przez jej babcię, Marię Louise Albertine z Leiningen-Falkenburg-Dagsburg w Darmstadt. 3 września 1785, w wieku piętnastu lat, Charlotte wyszła za mąż za księcia Fryderyka, księcia Saksonii-Altenburgii, małżeństwo nie było szczęśliwe, Charlotte była psychicznie lepsza od Fryderyka, który zaczął ją ignorować. Mieli również problemy, Saksonia-Hildburghausen został zrujnowany finansowo przez katastrofalną politykę poprzedników Fredericks. Odbiorcy pozwolili księciu i księżnej tylko zmniejszoną Listę Cywilną, ojciec Charlotte i dwaj bracia często przebywali z Charlotte w Hildburghausen. W 1787 roku przeniosła się na stałe do Hildburghausen i została przewodniczącą komitetu kredytowego. W 1792 roku babcia Charlotte i jej siostry uciekły przed następującą armią francuską z Darmstadt do Hildburghausen, a jej babcia zauważyła męża Charlotte. Ze wszystkich obowiązków wypełniał swoje obowiązki małżeńskie z zapałem. Charlotte, która nigdy nie kochała tego mężczyzny, jest zawsze w ciąży, rodzina spędziła kilka beztroskich tygodni w Hildburghausen. W 1793 roku babcia Charlotte wróciła z wygnania i wyjechała z siostrami Charlotte do Frankfurtu nad Menem, Charlotte miała bardzo intymny i kochający związek ze swoją siostrą Friederike i krewnymi w Strelitz. W 1803 i 1805 roku pruska para królewska odwiedziła Hildburghausen, z tej okazji odbiornicy pozwolili małżonkom książęcym odnowić część swoich mebli. Ludwika pomagała w przygotowaniu deklaracji wojny, Christian Truchseß von Wetzhausen zu Bettenburg był przyjacielem książęcej pary i ojcem chrzestnym syna Charlotte Edwarda. Wielu widzów przyszło zobaczyć bawarską księżniczkę koronną, kiedy przyjęła swoich gości, Truchseß próbowała najpierw poprowadzić niżej postawioną Charlotte do swojego zamku, ale odmówiła, odwołując się do jej córki. Truchseß odpowiedział: Wasza Wysokość mi wybaczy, ale dopóki ten zamek stoi tutaj, Teresa chwyciła baronów za drugą rękę i trzej z nich przeszli przez bramę razem. Księżna dała około połowy swoich dochodów biednym, emerytom<br/><br/>Z 1617 roku.<br/>Karol I (książę Hesji-Kassel)<br/>- Nie.<br/>Książę Karol Hesja-Kassel był kadetem rodu Hesja-Kassel i duńskim generałem feldmarszałkiem. Wychowany u krewnych na dworze duńskim, większość życia spędził w Danii, a jego matka była córką króla Jerzego II i Karoliny z Ansbach oraz siostrą królowej Danii Ludwiki. Jego ojciec, przyszły landgrab, opuścił rodzinę w 1747 roku, w 1755 roku formalnie zakończył małżeństwo z Maryją. Dziadek, Wilhelm VIII, hrabia Hesji, przyznał hrabstwo Hanau i jego dochody Maryi, młodemu księciu Karolowi i jego dwóm braciom, Wilhelmowi i Fryderykowi, wychowywanym przez matkę i wspieranym przez krewnych protestanckich od 1747 roku. W 1756 roku Maria przeniosła się do Danii, aby opiekować się nieletnimi dziećmi swojej siostry, królowej Ludwiki Duńskiej. Wzięła ze sobą swoich synów, którzy zostali wychowani na dworze w pałacu Christiansborg w Kopenhadze. Później książęta Hesji pozostali w Danii, stając się jej ważnymi władcami, tylko najstarszy brat Wilhelm powrócił do Hesji, w 1785 roku, po wstąpieniu do landgrofa. Karol rozpoczął karierę w Danii. W 1758 roku został mianowany pułkownikiem, w wieku 20 lat generałem majorem, także w 1766 roku został mianowany gubernatorem generalnym Norwegii, stanowisko, które zajmował do 1768 roku, ale które pozostawało głównie tytułowe, ponieważ nigdy nie udał się do Norwegii w tym okresie. W 1763 roku jego starszy brat William poślubił ich pierwszego kuzyna, Karol poszedł za nimi 30 sierpnia 1766 roku w pałacu Christiansborg – jego żoną była Ludwika z Danii, a Karol stał się szwagrem swojego kuzyna, króla Christiana VII. Małżeństwo odbyło się pomimo rad udzielonych przeciwko niemu, z powodu oskarżeń o rozpustę księcia Karola. Wkrótce potem, Karol wpadł w niechęć na dworze, a na początku 1767 roku, on i oni mieli swoje pierwsze dziecko, Marie Sophie, tam w 1767 roku, a następnie ich drugie dziecko, William, w 1769 roku. W 1768 roku Karol nabył posiadłość i wioskę Offenbach-Rumpenheim od rodziny Edelsheim. W 1771 roku rozszerzył dwór na zamek i siedzibę książęcą, a jego matka Maria mieszkała w pałacu aż do śmierci w 1772 roku. W 1781 roku Karol sprzedał pałac Rumpenheim swojemu młodszemu bratu, Karol zamieszkał na zamku Gottorp w Szlezwiku z rodziną. Mieli tam mieć trzecie dziecko Fryderyka w 1771 roku, w 1770 roku król Christian VII dał swojej siostrze posiadłość Tegelhof w Güby między miastem Schleswig i Eckernförde. Od 1772 do 1776 Karol miał letnią rezydencję zbudowaną na miejscu, które nazwał Louisenlund na cześć swojej żony, we wrześniu 1772 Karol został mianowany naczelnym dowódcą armii norweskiej, a on i Louise przenieśli się do Christiana. Przydzielenie było konsekwencją zamachu stanu króla Szwecji Gustawa III w dniu 19 sierpnia 1772 roku, podczas gdy w Norwegii księżniczka Ludwika urodziła czwarte dziecko Juliane w 1773 roku.<br/><br/>Osiemnaście.<br/>Ludwika Karolina Hesja-Kassel<br/>- Nie.<br/>Louise Caroline urodziła się w Gottorp w księstwie szlezwickim w rodzinie landgrafa Karola Hesji-Kassela i jego żony księżnej Ludwiki Duńskiej.

Uważany jest za założyciela Casa dEste, będąc głową pierwszej rodziny, która była mistrzem Este, Alberto Azzo II był jedynym synem Alberta Azzo I, markiza Mediolanu. Odziedziczył urzędy ojca około 1020 roku i stale powiększał swoje posiadłości w północnych Włoszech, w latach 1069-1070 próbował nabyć Maine dla swojego syna Hugha, ponieważ jego żona Garsende była współdziedziczką poprzednich hrabstw Maine. Hugh został ogłoszony hrabią, ale nie mógł pokonać Roberta, księcia Normandii, w Investiture Controverse między Henryka IV, cesarza Świętego Rzymu i papieża Grzegorza VII, Azzo próbował pośredniczyć, ale później dołączył do strony papieża. Około 1073 roku uczynił zamek w Este swoją rezydencją, z której dom Este, przed jego projektem budowlanym, Este był nieco więcej niż wioską. Jego syn Welf przeniósł się najpierw do Karyntii, a następnie do Bawarii, dając początek jednej z najważniejszych rodzin w historii Europy, inny syn, Fulk I z Mediolanu, po raz pierwszy udokumentował użycie tytułu markiza dEste. Azzo II poślubił Kunigunde, córkę Welfa II, hrabiego Altdorf i mieli jedno znane dziecko, Welf książę Bawarii od 1070 do 1077 i od 1096 do jego śmierci, który był pierwszym członkiem oddziału Welfa z rodu Este. Jego drugie małżeństwo było z Garsende, córką Herberta I, hrabiego Maine i mieli następujących znanych synów, Fulco I, markiza Mediolanu, przodek włoskiego oddziału rodu Este Hugh V, hrabiego Maine, nie miał problemu. Niektóre źródła mówią, że poślubił również Vitalię Orseolo, córkę Piotra Orseolo i miał romans pozamałżeński z Matyldą, siostrą Wilhelma, biskupa Padwy, z którą miał córkę o imieniu Adelasia, która poślubiła Guglielmo Adelardi.

Był pierwszym członkiem oddziału Welf z rodu Este, w genealogii Starszego Domu Welf jest liczony jako Welf IV. Welf był synem Azzo II z Este i jego żony Kunigunde z Altdorf, kiedy wujek Welf, książę Karyntii, zmarł bezdzietny, Welf odziedziczył jego majątek. Welf poślubił Ethelinde z Northeim, córkę Ottona II, księcia Bawarii, kiedy jego teść, książę Otto stał się wrogiem króla Henryka IV i stracił jego księstwo, Welf pozostał wierny królowi. Zgodnie z rozkazami Henryka odrzucił i rozwiódł się ze swoją księżną Ethelinde, a to wydarzenie miało miejsce w Goslar w 1070 roku, kiedy to stany Bawarii cicho poddały się nowo powstałemu księciu, który był przedstawicielem jednej z najstarszych rodzin w prowincji. Jego odrzucenie księżnej, które mogło być uznane za akt niesprawiedliwości. Papież i cesarz byli powierzchownie pojednani w 1076 roku, ale w tym roku ponownie zaangażowali się w aktywne działania wojenne. Henryk, w wyniku powtarzających się aktów buntu, ogłosił Welf obalony w jego nowo nabytego księstwa. Wspierany przez wiernych Bawarczyków i wspierany przez ojca we Włoszech, Welf był w stanie utrzymać swoje miejsce, jednak Grzegorz zmarł w 1085 roku, a jego następcy wzięli mniej intensywny udział w sprawach Niemiec. Welf, choć nadal przystępując do partii kościelnej, po rozwodzie, w 1070 roku, od swojej pierwszej żony, Welf ożenił się z Judytą Flandryjską, córką Baldwina IV, hrabiego Flandrii, i wdową Tostiga Godwinsona, hrabiego Northumbrii. W 1089 roku Welf, syn Welfa, poślubił Matyldę Toskańską, wzmacniając w ten sposób stosunki z papieżem, jednak po tym, jak młodszy Welf rozwiódł się z Matyldą w 1095 roku, Welf zadośćuczynił królowi Henrykowi IV i został ponownie potwierdzony jako książę Bawarii. Po śmierci ojca Azzo w 1097 roku Welf próbował nabyć majątek swoich ojców na południe od Alp, w 1099 roku Welf dołączył do tego, co stało się znane jako krucjata z 1101 roku, wraz z Wilhelmem IX z Akwitanii, Hugom z Vermandois i Idą z Austrii. Jego głównym sukcesem było zapobieżenie starciu między innymi krzyżowcami, którzy grabili terytorium Bizancjum w drodze do Konstantynopola, sam Welf uciekł z fiaska, ale zmarł w drodze powrotnej w Pafos na Cyprze w 1101 roku i został pochowany w opactwie Weingarten.

Jako młody człowiek zarządzał majątkiem rodzin Este na południe od Alp, poprzez małżeństwo z Wulfhilde, córką księcia Magnusa Saksonii, około 1095 roku, nabył część posiadłości Billung wokół Lüneburga. Aspirował do następstwa swojego teścia jako książę saksoński, gdy Magnus zmarł bez spadkobierców w 1106 roku. Książę Henryk mimo to utrzymywał bliskie stosunki z rządzącą dynastią Salian, w 1116 roku dołączył do cesarza Henryka V do drugiej kampanii włoskiej, aby przejąć posiadłości późnej markizy Matyldy Toskańskiej. Zastąpił swojego starszego brata Welfa II na stanowisku księcia bawarskiego, kiedy ten zmarł bezdzietny w 1120 roku, Henryk odegrał również rolę w doprowadzeniu do konkordatu w Worms w 1122 roku, kończąc długotrwałą kontrowersję inwestycyjną między papieżem a cesarzem. Małżeństwo zostało zawarte w maju 1127, odcięcie między dynastiami Welf i Hohenstaufen trwało do XIII wieku. Po wygraniu wyborów Lothar nałożył jednak cesarski zakaz na Fryderyka II.

| Follow Us<br/><br/>ARE YOU AN<br/><br/>INSIDER<br/><br/>Craving Sugar? Here's What Your Body Is Trying to Tell You<br/><br/>by<br/>Byrdie<br/><br/>PHOTO:<br/><br/>Jacquemus<br/><br/>Weight gain from out-of-control cravings aside, it can be frustrating to have a constant hankering for something unhealthy and not know why. The good news is that there's usually a reason underlying that burning desire to house a bag of potato chips, or the feeling that you might actually die if you don't get a pickle rightthisinstant (even though you're not pregnant). If you're having visions of Milky Way bars, for example, it could mean that you're missing a very specific nutrient in your diet. (Yup—it's more complicated than said chocolate bar being so darn delicious.)<br/><br/>We talked to Los Angeles–based dietitian Shira Lenchewski, M.S., R.D., to get the skinny on some common food cravings, as well as what you can do to satiate the hunger without going overboard. Keep scrolling for some seriously good information!<br/><br/>If you're craving chocolate<br/><br/>It means: You could be lacking magnesium in your diet, says Lenchewski. "Magnesium is an essential mineral involved in energy production, glucose metabolism, and muscle function. This is especially true for those hitting the gym hard," she explains. Additionally, magnesium levels lower during the pre-menstrual weeks of your period, which explains why PMS so often comes with chocolate cravings.<br/><br/>Instead, reach for high-quality, low-sugar dark chocolate, which is naturally high in magnesium. "I recommend sticking to 75 per cent cocoa or higher, and pairing it with another magnesium-rich source like sunflower seeds," says Lenchewski. She suggests the chocolate brand Hu, a small-batch food company that focuses on high-quality ingredients produced locally. "It's a little pricey, but all the more reason to keep portions in check," she says. "It's my personal favourite." We're also big fans of superfood-packed Zenbunni.<br/><br/>If you're craving candy<br/><br/>It means: "Craving pure sugar is a good indication that you're running low on energy," says Lenchewski. "Think about it. What is the one thing you're itching for after a terrible night's sleep or at around 4 p.m. during a stressful workday? The answer is usually sugar because it's used as instant fuel for our body's cells."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for apples with nut butter. "If you're raiding your co-workers' candy stash, I recommend a more slow-burn carbohydrate with a source of fat or protein," says Lenchewski. "Unlike simple sugar, this will fuel your cells while avoiding the post-sugar crash. Two options that make for great pick-me-ups the next time you're craving candy: a sliced apple with your choice of nut butter, or berries with 2% unsweetened Greek yoghurt." We like quashing a sweet tooth with these addictive coconut chips, too—they're filling, free of any added sugar, and just so good.<br/><br/>If you're craving salt<br/><br/>It means: "If nothing but the saltiest pickle will do, you may not be drinking enough H2O," says Lenchewski. "Salt helps the body hold on to water, so we crave it when we're in need of fluids."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for water. "Stay hydrated, especially as we approach the summer months," she says. The next time a craving hits, try quenching it (literally) with a few refreshing glasses and you might find the urgency to sodium binge disappears. "If plain water bores you, try adding in mint, lemon, or frozen fruit to mix it up," says Lenchewski. And if that still doesn't do the trick, there's a healthier alternative to bagged chips or fries. "If you're really just craving salt after all, toasted seaweed is a great low-calorie option," she says.<br/><br/>If you're craving starchy carbs like pasta<br/><br/>It means: "Because high-carb foods boost the feel-good hormone serotonin, starch cravings can be a sign you're in need of a mood booster," says Lenchewski.<br/><br/>Instead, reach for a bath! "Bust out the Epsom salts, because it's time for some serious R+R," says Lenchewski. "Trust me. Indulging in a starch free-for-all feels really good in the moment, but it will likely bum you out more the next day." (As anyone who has ever over-indulged a pizza or pasta craving knows.) So the next time you want to dive head first into a bowl of carbs, draw a bath, light a candle, and treat yourself without any regret or dense calories.<br/><br/>If you're craving ice cream<br/><br/>5 / 6<br/><br/>It means: "Your body may be telling you it's in need of some healthy fat."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for coconut ice cream. "I'm a realist, so if you're craving ice cream, I'm not going to recommend a handful of walnuts, which are, of course, full of healthy fat," says Lenchewski. "For ice cream emergencies, I recommend lower-in-sugar coconut ice-creams like Coconut Bliss or Kippy's three-ingredient ice cream in Los Angeles." We can vouch for the fact that coconut ice cream tastes incredible and just like the real thing.<br/><br/>If you're craving a burger<br/><br/>It means: You need iron. "If you can't stop thinking about red meat, there's a chance your body is craving iron, b12 and folic acid," says Lenchewski. "This is especially true during or around that time of the month."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for a healthier burger. "I'm a proponent of grass fed, antibiotic and hormone-free red meat once a week," says Lenchewski. "Try experimenting with an open-faced bison burger—which, cut for cut, is leaner and has more iron than beef." Don't eat meat? Try to incorporate some kind of plant-based iron supplement into your routine, like spirulina. | Obserwuj nas<br/><br/>CZY JESTEŚ<br/><br/>INSIDER<br/><br/>Chcesz cukru?

Dobrą wiadomością jest to, że zwykle istnieje powód, dla którego pali się chęć przechowywania torby ziemniaczanych chipsów lub uczucie, że możesz faktycznie umrzeć, jeśli nie dostaniesz ogórka w tej chwili (nawet jeśli nie jesteś w ciąży). Jeśli masz wizje batoników Drogi Mlecznej, na przykład, może to oznaczać, że brakuje Ci bardzo specyficznego składnika odżywczego w diecie. (Tak — to bardziej skomplikowane niż mówienie, że batonik czekoladowy jest tak cholernie pyszny.)<br/><br/>Rozmawialiśmy z dietetykiem z Los Angeles Shira Lenchewski, MS, R.D., aby uzyskać chude na niektóre powszechne apetyt, a także co można zrobić, aby zaspokoić głód bez przechodzenia za burtę. Kontynuuj przewijanie po kilka poważnie dobrych informacji!<br/><br/>Jeśli chcesz czekolady<br/><br/>Oznacza to: Może brakować magnezu w diecie, mówi Lenchewski. "Magnez jest niezbędnym minerałem zaangażowanym w produkcję energii, metabolizm glukozy i funkcjonowanie mięśni. Jest to szczególnie prawdziwe dla tych, którzy ciężko biją siłownię ", wyjaśnia. Ponadto poziom magnezu obniża się podczas przedmiesiączkowych tygodni miesiączki, co wyjaśnia, dlaczego PMS tak często pochodzi z apetytem na czekoladę.<br/><br/>Zamiast tego poszukaj wysokiej jakości ciemnej czekolady o niskiej zawartości cukru, która jest naturalnie bogata w magnez. „Zalecam trzymać się 75 procent kakao lub więcej i łączyć je z innym bogatym w magnez źródłem, takim jak nasiona słonecznika”, mówi Lenchewski. Sugeruje czekoladową markę Hu, małą firmę spożywczą, która koncentruje się na wysokiej jakości składnikach produkowanych lokalnie. „To trochę drogie, ale tym bardziej powód, aby trzymać porcje pod kontrolą”, mówi. „To mój osobisty ulubiony.” Jesteśmy również wielkimi fanami superfood pakowane Zenbunni.<br/><br/>Jeśli pragniesz cukierków<br/><br/>Oznacza to: „Żądanie czystego cukru jest dobrym sygnałem, że brakuje ci energii” – mówi Lenchewski. „Pomyśl o tym. Co jest jedyną rzeczą, na którą tęsknisz po okropnym nocnym śnie lub około 16:00 podczas stresującego dnia w pracy? Odpowiedzią jest zwykle cukier, ponieważ jest on używany jako paliwo natychmiastowe dla komórek naszego ciała.<br/><br/>Zamiast tego sięgnij po jabłka z masłem orzechowym. „Jeśli najeżdżasz słodycze swoich współpracowników, zalecam bardziej powolne spalanie węglowodanów ze źródłem tłuszczu lub białka”, mówi Lenchewski. W przeciwieństwie do zwykłego cukru, będzie to zasilać komórki, unikając katastrofy po cukier. Dwie opcje, które sprawią, że następnym razem będziesz mieć ochotę na cukierki: pokrojone jabłko z masłem orzechowym lub jagody z 2% niesłodzonym jogurtem greckim. Lubimy też zgniatać słodki ząb z tymi wciągającymi chipami kokosowymi - są nadziewane, wolne od cukru i po prostu tak dobre.<br/><br/>Jeśli pragniesz soli<br/><br/>Oznacza to: "Jeśli nic poza najsłabszym marynatem nie zrobisz, możesz nie pić wystarczającej ilości H2O" - mówi Lenchewski. "Sól pomaga organizmowi trzymać się wody, więc pragniemy jej, gdy potrzebujemy płynów."<br/><br/>Zamiast tego sięgnij po wodę. "Zachowaj nawodnienie, zwłaszcza gdy zbliżamy się do letnich miesięcy" - mówi. Następnym razem, gdy uderzy apetyt, spróbuj go ugasić (dosłownie) kilkoma orzeźwiającymi szklankami, a może zauważysz, że znika nagląca potrzeba picia sodu. "Jeśli zwykła woda cię nudzi, spróbuj dodać miętę, cytrynę lub mrożone owoce, aby je wymieszać", mówi Lenchewski. A jeśli to nadal nie działa, istnieje zdrowsza alternatywa dla woreczków z frytkami lub frytkami. "Jeśli naprawdę po prostu pragniesz soli, tostowane wodorosty morskie są świetną opcją o niskiej kaloryczności" - mówi.<br/><br/>Jeśli pragniesz skrobiowych węglowodanów jak makaron<br/><br/>Oznacza to: "Ponieważ pokarmy o wysokiej zawartości węglowodanów zwiększają poziom hormonu serotoniny, apetyt na skrobię może być oznaką, że potrzebujesz wzmacniacza nastroju" - mówi Lenchewski.<br/><br/>Zamiast tego sięgnij po kąpiel! „Wyciągnij sole Epsom, bo nadszedł czas na poważne R+R” – mówi Lenchewski. „Zaufaj mi. Pozwolenie na skrobię za darmo dla wszystkich czuje się naprawdę dobrze w tej chwili, ale najprawdopodobniej następnego dnia wyśpiewa cię jeszcze bardziej.” (Jak wie każdy, kto kiedykolwiek nadużywał pizzy lub makaronu.) Więc następnym razem, gdy chcesz najpierw zanurzyć głowę w misce węglowodanów, narysuj kąpiel, zapal świecę i ucztuj się bez żalu lub gęstych kalorii.<br/><br/>Jeśli pragniesz lodów<br/><br/>5 / 6<br/><br/>Oznacza to: "Twoje ciało może ci mówić, że potrzebuje zdrowego tłuszczu."<br/><br/>Zamiast tego sięgnij po lody kokosowe. „Jestem realistą, więc jeśli chcesz lodów, nie polecam garści orzechów, które są oczywiście pełne zdrowego tłuszczu” – mówi Lenchewski. "W nagłych wypadkach z lodami polecam lody kokosowe o niższej zawartości cukru, takie jak Coconut Bliss lub trzyskładnikowe lody Kippy w Los Angeles." Możemy zagwarantować, że lody kokosowe smakują niewiarygodnie i po prostu jak prawdziwe.<br/><br/>Jeśli chcesz hamburgera<br/><br/>Oznacza to: Potrzebujesz żelaza. "Jeśli nie możesz przestać myśleć o czerwonym mięsie, istnieje szansa, że twoje ciało pragnie żelaza, b12 i kwasu foliowego" - mówi Lenchewski. "Jest to szczególnie prawdziwe podczas lub około tej pory miesiąca."<br/><br/>Zamiast tego sięgnij po zdrowszego burgera. „Jestem zwolennikiem karmienia trawą, antybiotykami i bezhormonalnym czerwonym mięsem raz w tygodniu”, mówi Lenchewski. „Spróbuj eksperymentować z bizonowym burgerem z otwartą twarzą – który, cięty do cięcia, jest szczuplejszy i ma więcej żelaza niż wołowina.” Nie jedz mięsa? Spróbuj włączyć do swojej rutyny jakiś suplement żelaza na bazie roślin, taki jak spirulina. |

Spoiler alert: This brain teaser is entirely solvable. Scroll down to read the puzzle, and to get the answer. Good luck!<br/><br/>Here's The Puzzle<br/><br/>Alice and Bob are each told a number, but neither knows the other's number. Both of the numbers are positive and consecutive. In the room with Alice and Bob, there is a clock that dings every minute. Someone can guess the other's number only at the ding of that clock, but they can also remain silent. If someone correctly guesses the other's number on the first try, both people $1 million.<br/><br/>There is a way to win without any form of communication between Alice and Bob, and, duh, without cheating. It's completely logical and can guarantee a win on the first try. How can they do it? Watch the video below to find out.<br/><br/>The Seemingly Impossible Guess The Number Puzzle<br/><br/>Share the knowledge!<br/><br/>Here's The Answer<br/><br/>Suppose Alice is told the number N. She hears the clock ding N-1 times, so she knows that Bob was told N+1. Therefore, on the next ding, she can correctly guess Bob's secret number. If we're dealing with small numbers, however, it can be played differently. If Alice was told 1, she knows Bob was told 2 because 0 is not a positive (or negative) number.

Słyszy zegar ding N-1 razy, więc wie, że Bob został powiedziany N + 1. Dlatego w następnym ding, ona może poprawnie odgadnąć sekretny numer Boba. Jeśli mamy do czynienia z małymi liczbami, jednak, to może być odtwarzane inaczej. Jeśli Alice powiedziano 1, wie, że Bobowi powiedziano 2, ponieważ 0 nie jest liczbą dodatnią (lub ujemną).

| Web Services, Vendors And Cyber Laws!<br/><br/>Updated On:April 21, 2014Bilal Ahmad<br/><br/>Computerization of this world changed human performance scenario to a great extent and that too beyond measurement. For instance, Now you can send vital information all across the globe with a single mouse click, thanks to internet connectivity. Sadly, it is this wide connectivity and popularity among people, internet has also increased chances for computer crimes. Internet crimes or computer crimes are widely known as 'Cyber Crimes'.<br/><br/>'Cyber Laws' is something new in the judiciary system but has gained a lot of attention lately. The term cyber crime is something very synonymous with conventional crime, the only difference being medium of execution. There are majorly two types of cyber crimes, the first one is in which computers are the main targets and these include cases of data damage, malicious code and even criminal data access. The second one is in which computer is only a tool using which conventional crimes are committed for eg cyber terrorism, spamming, cyber stalking and many more.<br/><br/>This is where a website consultant or a vendor comes into scene. Although not aware of all the cyber laws present till date, a website vendor can advise you on some of the most vital cyber laws while creating your site.<br/><br/>This may include common knowledge of copy rights or even protecting the content of your own website. Explaining you all the rights you posses as a website owner is also one the tasks a website vendor may do while developing your website. A vendor can also assist you by offering you information on different cyber laws to protect data. Besides all of this, a vendor can also offer you information on any new cyber law that you may not be aware of till know. Cyber laws may vary from nation to nation, one recent example can be of the cookie law released in the United Kingdom, which prevents the website from saving any user browsing data. As per the Cookie Law, websites in the United Kingdom cannot save cookie files without informational consent from the surfer.<br/><br/>It is after the implementation of such law, websites now have a pop-up window, which seeks the consent of the visitor for saving cookies files. Such files are used by websites to analyze the browsing pattern of visitors based on which advertisements are then posted on a user window. With hacking not anymore a new thing for all of us, do you think such rules and regulations can prevent online forgery or cyber crime? Technology has developed at a rapid rate but still people do not prefer shopping online due to fear of personal or bank account details getting hacked. With the rise of cyber crime, need of stringent cyber laws have also increased to curb the same and to promote a risk free shopping experience.<br/><br/>Classes of Cyber Crimes<br/><br/>Over the years there have been three major classes of cyber crimes:<br/><br/>Unauthorized access of computer system cases, which involves hacking or stealing usernames and passwords to gain access over personal information of the respective user. These kind of backdoor access are organized with the help of Trojan Horse. Releasing malicious programs like Trojan House, worms or computer viruses etc. The last class includes cyber stalking a user or online harassment .<br/><br/>Direct implications of Cyber crimes<br/><br/>Decrease in sales<br/><br/>Decrease in staff output due to network delays<br/><br/>Loss of personalized information like research work<br/><br/>Disruption in communication process<br/><br/>Indirect implications of Cyber crimes<br/><br/>Credibility issue in our financial system<br/><br/>Brand image is tarnished in the market<br/><br/>Cyber crimes affect business to business relationship in the market<br/><br/>Sense of trust in state policies and government agencies is lost<br/><br/>Preventing Cyber Crime<br/><br/>As netizens there are certain precautions that we should consider for a safe and secure online experience. Here are some of them:<br/><br/>First thing to do will be to keep personal information to your self and avoid sharing the same online.<br/><br/>Avoid sharing any photographs with online chat friends or strangers.<br/><br/>Installing latest version of anti-virus on your system can offer you a good line of defense against internet threats like viruses and malware.<br/><br/>Keeping back up of your valuable data is a good option to avoid problems like virus contamination.<br/><br/>Avoid sending credit card information to sites that are unsecured and don't have any valid certificate.<br/><br/>Installing safety programme that offers you control over site cookies and saves you from being tracked by websites.<br/><br/>Putting host-based intrusions detection devices on servers will help you keep track of irregularities on your website traffic.<br/><br/>Use of firewall is advised.<br/><br/>Why Cyber attacks are so popular?<br/><br/>Cheaper than traditional cheating methods<br/><br/>Tracking cyber crimes are not easy<br/><br/>Exact locations cannot be tracked easily<br/><br/>Absence of physical barrier in the internet world<br/><br/>Cyber crimes affect large number of people<br/><br/>Conclusion<br/><br/>The fact that human mind has unfathomable power is undeniable, which is why internet crimes are increasing at a tremendous rate. Even history has witnessed some of the greatest internet security gone kaput by the hands of hackers, who have easily got away too. The only way to curb such crime is to remain aware of the cyber laws that we have today, that can either be through internet or through website/IT vendors. Information Technology Act has to be balanced in such a way that it proves too stringent for people who are involved in cyber crimes and at the same time it should never hamper the growth of Internet industry.<br/><br/>Author Bio:– Maneet Puri at present is heading a quality web design firm located at New Delhi, India. With unmatchable expertise in technical domain, he has been offering professional web consultation services to his clients located all round the globe. He is also an avid writer and some of his commended work have been published on renowned websites | Usługi internetowe, dostawcy i prawa cybernetyczne!<br/><br/>Zaktualizowano:Kwiecień 21, 2014Bilal Ahmad<br/><br/>Komputerizacja tego świata w dużym stopniu zmieniła ludzki scenariusz wydajności i to również poza pomiarem. Na przykład, Teraz możesz wysyłać ważne informacje na całym świecie za pomocą jednego kliknięcia myszką, dzięki połączeniu z Internetem. Niestety, to jest ta szeroka łączność i popularność wśród ludzi, Internet ma również zwiększone szanse na przestępstwa komputerowe. Przestępstwa internetowe lub przestępstwa komputerowe są powszechnie znane jako "Cyberprzestępstwa".<br/><br/>"Prawa cybernetyczne" to coś nowego w systemie sądownictwa, ale ostatnio zyskało wiele uwagi. Termin cyberprzestępczość jest czymś bardzo synonimem konwencjonalnej przestępczości, jedyną różnicą jest środek egzekucji. Istnieją głównie dwa rodzaje cyberprzestępczości, z których pierwszy dotyczy komputerów jako głównych celów i obejmują one przypadki uszkodzenia danych, złośliwego kodu, a nawet dostępu do danych przestępczych. Drugim jest to, że komputer jest tylko narzędziem, za pomocą którego popełniane są konwencjonalne przestępstwa, np. cyberterroryzm, spam, cyberprześladowanie i wiele innych.<br/><br/>To jest miejsce, w którym konsultant strony internetowej lub dostawca przychodzi na scenę. Chociaż nie zdajesz sobie sprawy ze wszystkich cyberprzepisów obecnych do tej pory, dostawca strony internetowej może doradzić Ci na temat niektórych z najważniejszych przepisów cyberprzepisów podczas tworzenia witryny.<br/><br/>Może to obejmować powszechną znajomość praw do kopiowania, a nawet ochronę treści własnej witryny. Wyjaśnienie wszystkich praw, które posiadasz jako właściciel witryny, jest również jednym z zadań, które dostawca witryny może wykonać podczas tworzenia witryny. Sprzedawca może również pomóc, oferując informacje o różnych prawach cybernetycznych w celu ochrony danych. Oprócz tego wszystkiego, sprzedawca może również zaoferować informacje o wszelkich nowych prawach cybernetycznych, o których możesz nie wiedzieć. Cyberprzepisy mogą się różnić w zależności od kraju, jednym z ostatnich przykładów może być ustawa o plikach cookie wydana w Wielkiej Brytanii, która uniemożliwia witrynie zapisywanie danych o przeglądaniu przez użytkownika. Zgodnie z ustawą o plikach cookie, strony internetowe w Wielkiej Brytanii nie mogą zapisywać plików cookie bez zgody użytkownika.<br/><br/>To właśnie po wdrożeniu takiej ustawy, strony internetowe mają teraz wyskakujące okienko, które prosi o zgodę odwiedzającego na zapisywanie plików cookies. Pliki te są wykorzystywane przez strony internetowe do analizy wzorca przeglądania przez odwiedzających na podstawie tego, które reklamy są następnie publikowane w oknie użytkownika. Czy sądzisz, że takie zasady i regulacje mogą zapobiec fałszerstwom online lub cyberprzestępczości, ponieważ hacking nie jest już czymś nowym dla nas wszystkich? Technologia rozwinęła się w szybkim tempie, ale nadal ludzie nie wolą zakupów online ze względu na obawę przed osobistymi lub bankowymi danymi rachunkowymi. Wraz ze wzrostem przestępczości cybernetycznej wzrosła również potrzeba wprowadzenia surowych przepisów dotyczących cyberprzestępczości, aby ograniczyć ten problem i promować zakupy wolne od ryzyka.<br/><br/>Klasy cyberprzestępczości<br/><br/>Na przestrzeni lat odnotowano trzy główne klasy cyberprzestępczości:<br/><br/>Nieautoryzowany dostęp do przypadków systemu komputerowego, który polega na włamaniu lub kradzieży nazw użytkowników i haseł w celu uzyskania dostępu do danych osobowych danego użytkownika. Tego rodzaju dostęp backdoor jest organizowany za pomocą konia trojańskiego. Uwalnianie szkodliwych programów, takich jak Trojan House, robaki lub wirusy komputerowe itp. Ostatnia klasa obejmuje cyberprześladowanie użytkownika lub nękanie online.<br/><br/>Bezpośrednie konsekwencje cyberprzestępczości<br/><br/>Spadek sprzedaży<br/><br/>Zmniejszenie liczby pracowników z powodu opóźnień sieciowych<br/><br/>Utrata spersonalizowanych informacji, takich jak prace badawcze<br/><br/>Zakłócenia w procesie komunikacji<br/><br/>Pośrednie konsekwencje cyberprzestępczości<br/><br/>Kwestia wiarygodności w naszym systemie finansowym<br/><br/>Wizerunek marki jest zaciemniony na rynku<br/><br/>Cyberprzestępczość wpływa na relacje biznes-biznes na rynku<br/><br/>Poczucie zaufania do polityki państwowej i agencji rządowych jest utracone<br/><br/>Zapobieganie cyberprzestępczości<br/><br/>Jako użytkownicy sieci istnieją pewne środki ostrożności, które powinniśmy rozważyć dla bezpiecznego i bezpiecznego korzystania z Internetu. Oto niektóre z nich:<br/><br/>Pierwszą rzeczą do zrobienia będzie zachowanie danych osobowych dla siebie i unikanie udostępniania tych samych w Internecie.<br/><br/>Unikaj udostępniania zdjęć znajomym lub nieznajomym na czacie online.<br/><br/>Instalacja najnowszej wersji antywirusa w systemie może zaoferować dobrą linię obrony przed zagrożeniami internetowymi, takimi jak wirusy i złośliwe oprogramowanie.<br/><br/>Utrzymanie kopii zapasowej cennych danych jest dobrym rozwiązaniem, aby uniknąć problemów, takich jak infekcje wirusami.<br/><br/>Unikaj wysyłania informacji o karcie kredytowej do witryn, które nie są zabezpieczone i nie mają ważnego certyfikatu.<br/><br/>Instalacja programu bezpieczeństwa, który oferuje kontrolę nad plikami cookie witryny i oszczędza od śledzenia przez witryny.<br/><br/>Umieszczenie urządzeń do wykrywania włamań opartych na hostach na serwerach pomoże Ci śledzić nieprawidłowości w ruchu na stronie.<br/><br/>Zaleca się stosowanie firewalla.<br/><br/>Dlaczego cyberataki są tak popularne?<br/><br/>Tańsze niż tradycyjne metody oszukiwania<br/><br/>Śledzenie cyberprzestępczości nie jest łatwe<br/><br/>Dokładne lokalizacje nie mogą być łatwo śledzone<br/><br/>Brak fizycznych barier w internecie<br/><br/>Cyberprzestępczość dotyka wielu ludzi<br/><br/>Wniosek<br/><br/>Fakt, że ludzki umysł ma niepojętą moc, jest niezaprzeczalny, dlatego przestępczość internetowa rośnie w ogromnym tempie. Nawet historia była świadkiem tego, że niektóre z największych zabezpieczeń internetowych zostały zniszczone przez hakerów, którzy z łatwością uciekli. Jedynym sposobem na ograniczenie takiej przestępczości jest pozostanie świadomym cyberprzepisów, które mamy dzisiaj, które mogą być za pośrednictwem Internetu lub za pośrednictwem stron internetowych / dostawców IT. Ustawa o technologiach informacyjnych musi być zrównoważona w taki sposób, aby okazała się zbyt surowa dla osób zaangażowanych w cyberprzestępczość, a jednocześnie nigdy nie powinna utrudniać rozwoju branży internetowej.<br/><br/>Autor Bio: – Maneet Puri obecnie prowadzi firmę zajmującą się projektowaniem stron internetowych z siedzibą w New Delhi w Indiach.
