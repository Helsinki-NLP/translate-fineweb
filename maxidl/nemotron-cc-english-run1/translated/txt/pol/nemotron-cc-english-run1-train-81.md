| Forty-nine years ago today, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act of 1965.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Nearly a century ago, the 15th Amendment to the Constitution stated, "The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of race, color or previous condition of servitude." And nearly a century before that, our nation's founding fathers set in motion the great experiment of American democracy by declaring that "all men are created equal."<br/><br/>The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was a belated acknowledgment that even in America, our foundational ideals carry little weight if not protected by the rule of law. That's why Section 2 of the 15th Amendment granted Congress the "power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation."<br/><br/>And indeed, the codified language of the Voting Rights Act was able to achieve what the Reconstruction-era Congress and Thomas Jefferson could not. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act—and the civil rights movement from which they emerged—served as the catalyst for a dramatic increase in the opportunity for black Americans to participate in the democratic process.<br/><br/>For example, only 6.7 percent of eligible black Mississippians were registered to vote as of 1962; by 1969 that figure had reached 66.5 percent. Today, Mississippi has more black elected officials than any other state.<br/><br/>The protections put in place by the Voting Rights Act were long overdue when they were passed, representative of the arduous struggle with which they were achieved. But unthinkably, these protections are now under assault, jeopardizing the progress our nation worked so hard to achieve.<br/><br/>Last year, in the case of Shelby County v. Holder, the U.S. Supreme Court gutted a key component of the Voting Rights Act that enabled prior federal review to ensure nondiscrimination before any new voting law went into effect.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Sadly, the response of Republican leaders has been to do nothing. Sen. Ted Cruz and Gov. Rick Perry went out of their way to praise the Supreme Court's decision. Sen. Rand Paul dismissed the continued necessity of the Voting Rights Act by noting, "We have an African-American president."<br/><br/>While the election of President Barack Obama was indeed a historic milestone, it is dangerous to think that it absolves us from remaining vigilant against the lingering consequences of our nation's past. The haste with which states have moved to enact voting restrictions is confirmation that the protections put in place by Section 4 are still necessary.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Republican governors have signed strict photo-identification restrictions into law as the solution to a virtually nonexistent problem of voter impersonation, disproportionately hurting women, young people, working families and the African-American community. It's disingenuous for Republicans like Paul to seek the votes of these communities when they believe "there's nothing wrong with" putting restrictions in place that make it harder for these constituencies to vote.<br/><br/>Republicans have also sought to restrict early-voting periods, including the Sunday before Election Day, when African-American churches have had great success with Souls to the Polls programs.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>These restrictions represent a callous effort by Republicans to make voting harder, based on narrow, short-term political calculations that Republicans can win elections by shrinking the size of the electorate.<br/><br/>Democrats have a very different mission when it comes to voting: to ensure that every eligible voter can register, that every registered voter can vote and that every vote is accurately counted.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>The Democratic National Committee's Voter Expansion Project reflects our belief that greater voter participation strengthens our nation and our democracy. We'll continue to use our unmatched institutional knowledge to protect voting rights against legislation and tactics that would attempt to suppress the vote. And because the best defense is a good offense, we're also working to expand the vote by deploying our technology and data resources to register new voters.<br/><br/>On this anniversary, one of the best ways we can honor those who struggled—and in some cases gave their very lives—for the legislation's passage is for Republicans in Congress to join Democrats in passing the Voting Rights Amendment Act to restore the promise of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Democrat, represents Florida's 23rd Congressional District in the United States Congress. Since 2011, she has served as chair of the Democratic National Committee. Follow her on Twitter.<br/><br/>The Root aims to foster and advance conversations about issues relevant to the black Diaspora by presenting a variety of opinions from all perspectives, whether or not those opinions are shared by our editorial staff. | Czterdzieści dziewięć lat temu prezydent Lyndon B. Johnson podpisał ustawę o prawach wyborczych z 1965 roku.<br/><br/>Reklama<br/><br/>Prawie sto lat temu, w 15. poprawce do konstytucji, stwierdzono, że „prawo obywateli Stanów Zjednoczonych do głosowania nie może być odrzucone lub skrócone przez Stany Zjednoczone lub jakikolwiek stan ze względu na rasę, kolor skóry lub poprzedni stan niewolnictwa”. I prawie wiek przed tym, ojcowie założyciele naszego narodu uruchomili wielki eksperyment amerykańskiej demokracji, deklarując, że "wszyscy ludzie są stworzeni równi".<br/><br/>Ustawa o prawach wyborczych z 1965 roku była opóźnionym uznaniem, że nawet w Ameryce nasze fundamentalne ideały mają niewielkie znaczenie, jeśli nie są chronione przez rządy prawa. Dlatego sekcja 2 15. poprawki przyznała Kongresowi „uprawnienie do egzekwowania tego artykułu przez odpowiednie prawo”.<br/><br/>I rzeczywiście, skodyfikowany język ustawy o prawach wyborczych był w stanie osiągnąć to, czego Kongres z czasów odbudowy i Thomas Jefferson nie byli w stanie. Ustawa o prawach obywatelskich z 1964 r. i Ustawa o prawach wyborczych – oraz ruch praw obywatelskich, z którego wyłoniły się – służyły jako katalizator dramatycznego wzrostu możliwości udziału czarnych Amerykanów w procesie demokratycznym.<br/><br/>Na przykład tylko 6,7 procent kwalifikujących się czarnych Mississippians zostały zarejestrowane do głosowania od 1962; do 1969 liczba ta osiągnęła 66.5 procent. Dziś Mississippi ma więcej czarnych wybranych urzędników niż jakikolwiek inny stan.<br/><br/>Ochrona wprowadzona przez ustawę o prawach głosu była dawno spóźniona, gdy została uchwalona, reprezentująca trudną walkę, z którą została osiągnięta. Ale nie do pomyślenia, te zabezpieczenia są teraz atakowane, zagrażając postępowi, nad którym nasz naród tak ciężko pracował.<br/><br/>W ubiegłym roku, w sprawie Shelby County przeciwko Holderowi, Sąd Najwyższy Stanów Zjednoczonych wypatroszył kluczowy element ustawy o prawach głosu, który umożliwił wcześniejszy przegląd federalny w celu zapewnienia niedyskryminacji przed wejściem w życie nowego prawa głosowania.<br/><br/>Reklama<br/><br/>Niestety, odpowiedzią przywódców republikanów było nic nie robienie. Senator Ted Cruz i gubernator Rick Perry poszli swoją drogą, aby pochwalić decyzję Sądu Najwyższego. Senator Rand Paul odrzucił ciągłą konieczność ustawy o prawach wyborczych, zauważając: „Mamy afroamerykańskiego prezydenta”.<br/><br/>Choć wybór prezydenta Baracka Obamy był rzeczywiście historycznym kamieniem milowym, niebezpieczne jest myślenie, że zwalnia nas to z czujności na długotrwałe konsekwencje przeszłości naszego narodu. Pośpiech, z jakim państwa przystąpiły do wprowadzenia ograniczeń głosowania, jest potwierdzeniem, że ochrona wprowadzona przez sekcję 4 jest nadal konieczna.<br/><br/>Reklama<br/><br/>Republikańscy gubernatorzy podpisali surowe ograniczenia dotyczące identyfikacji fotograficznej w prawie jako rozwiązanie praktycznie nieistniejącego problemu udawania wyborców, nieproporcjonalnie raniących kobiety, młodzież, rodziny pracujące i społeczność afroamerykańską.

| Q&A: Vatican safeguarding expert Fr Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>13 June 2021<br/><br/>Fr Hans Zollner SJ. Image: Australian Jesuits.<br/><br/>The President of the Centre for Child Protection at the Gregorian University in Rome, and a member of the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors, Fr Hans Zollner SJ, was in Australia in 2018 to speak to Catholic ministry leaders and survivors.<br/><br/>Michael McVeigh from Jesuit Communications sat down with him during the visit to explore how the Church is responding to the abuse crisis internationally, and what can be learned from our experiences in Australia.<br/><br/>MM: This is your third trip to Australia. You've visited quite a few other countries to see how the Church is responding to abuse around the world. Can you give us some idea of what the global picture looks like?<br/><br/>Fr Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>HZ: My understanding, after having visited about 50 countries on five or six continents, is that the Church is really starting to move over the last couple of years on the issue of doing justice to victims, of listening to them, and doing whatever can be done in terms of safeguarding.<br/><br/>I was with the Jesuit Provincials from all over Africa at the end of April, and the President of the Jesuit Assistancy of Africa and Madagascar is very much committed and dedicated to this. He has put up a thorough action plan for formation and for introducing guidelines all over the place. It's a very considerate and very deliberate effort to do whatever can be done to be proactively engaged as Jesuits in Africa — in a continent where until a few years ago all of this was a foreign language.<br/><br/>One of the challenges of trying to develop this global approach is that you're dealing with so many cultures, and so many different understandings. How do you bring this together and try to provide training and support religious communities tackling these issues?<br/><br/>This is one of the major questions we have. I think what I can do is stimulate discussion, stimulate reflection, and prepare people as much as possible so that they can do the groundwork.<br/><br/>The Centre for Child Protection at the Gregorian University does not pretend to have the response to every question. Not only because we don't know the specific contexts — we might know a few of them, but we're talking about thousands of cultures, we're talking about hundreds of languages, we're talking about very diverse legal backgrounds. It varies even sometimes within one country, such as Australia where you have states within the Commonwealth of Australia that have different laws than other states.<br/><br/>I am somebody who tries to elicit and stimulate discussion and reflection. I'm also very happy to listen to people.<br/><br/>You mentioned the need to listen and support victims in being heard. We've obviously had the Royal Commission here in Australia, but what are some of the other ways that you've seen that the voices of victims are being supported around the world?<br/><br/>In France there is one diocese that has established what they call 'The Listening Space'. There, victims can come forward and they can express themselves. The bishop is present. It's an open space in which people who have been hurt tremendously are free at least to express what they want to ask from the Church leadership etc.<br/><br/>There are other places in the USA or in other countries where victims have been invited by dioceses, by Provinces, by the leadership of the Church, to come forward. I have to say that overall I think there is a good will, and there are more people like bishops and provincials who listen to victims than we know. But there is no one model of giving victims not only the space to express themselves and be listened to, but also to engage actively in Church development.<br/><br/>In terms of setting up spaces for support for victims, what are some of the things you've seen that could really help — and that we could be considering here in Australia?<br/><br/>One of the major points that many victims bring up is, 'Can't we have, within parish settings, within schools settings, a regular conversation going on that includes survivors of abuse as regular members of a committee, a commission, a sounding board, a feedback group or something like that?' So that this voice is not only brought in on a specific occasion, or where a person feels like he or she is at a point to be able to speak out about it, but [is heard] on a regular basis — build that voice into the system.<br/><br/>That will help all of us. It will help survivors and victims because they will feel welcome and appreciated in the specific experience, and in the specific life challenges, that they went through. Secondly it will help the community at large, because we can at least make ourselves more and more sensitive to what the concerns and specific needs of survivors are — that can also talk to the needs of young people.<br/><br/>M: We have strong groups of survivors here in Australia who have been able to support each other through that process. But what you're saying is that we need some way of supporting those groups, and supporting those people, through our own institutions as well?<br/><br/>And I think we need to be creative. It will work for one school and one parish and one diocese in one way, and for others in a different way. Because the survivors with whom I am in constant contact, they have quite similar requests, and similar experiences in regard to being welcomed in the Church or not — feeling thrown out or dismissed. But they have also among themselves quite different expectations. So I have learned that you have also to be very forthcoming in accepting the differences in what this specific group, or this specific survivor, wants, requests and needs.<br/><br/>M: Survivors talk about wanting to have their stories heard and acknowledged. We've had the Royal Commission here in Australia, which provided an independent process where victims could come forward. Is there a need for something like that in terms of a truth, justice and reconciliation process for the Church internationally?<br/><br/>H: Yes, I think there is a need for that internationally. But I think first every local church needs to do its own homework. I don't see it happening very soon that some such council or commission would be established to look into this area for the whole Church. The Church has a membership of 1.3 billion people, and is present in 190 countries, with all kinds of differences in expectations concerning psychological, spiritual and financial support.<br/><br/>There is one thing that I have come across consistently in communicating with, working with and listening to victims, and that is that they want to be listened to. So if there was the feeling that victims were constantly being listened to — in Rome and elsewhere — I think that would give a great relief to many victims.<br/><br/>I think [Pope Francis'] concern, especially with regard to your question, is that the local churches do whatever they can so that victims will be listened to in that particular country. I have a list of people who want to speak to the Holy Father directly, and physically it is impossible. I was there in 2014 to translate for two German survivors who were chosen with two Irish and two English survivors when he received the six of them at home. He took the whole morning listening to them one after the other. For each one, he was there for 40 to 45 minutes. Were he to do this for every survivor he couldn't sleep anymore.<br/><br/>His example is modelling for the whole Catholic Church the way victims and survivors are received, welcomed and listened to. I think if the bishops and the provincials in this world, in all countries, followed his example, many survivors would be really appreciative of that.<br/><br/>Archbishop Diarmud Martin was recently quoted just before the World Meeting of Families, about the Pontifical Commission, saying that it's too small as it's currently set up to achieve what it needs to achieve. What's your take on that? Does the Church need to be putting more resources into how it's overseeing those issues?<br/><br/>At the moment we are 16 members from basically all continents, and the major language groups. We represent a variety of disciplines and professions, and the purpose of the commission — as the statutes that have just been promulgated state — is to provide counsel to the Holy Father.<br/><br/>A common misunderstanding about the commission is first that we deal with cases of allegations. That is not the case. We have no juridical or administrative power in regards to cases, because when it comes to allegations of abuse the tribunals and procedure are set.<br/><br/>A second misunderstanding is that we promote, directly, things on the ground. Our first and foremost goal is that we advise the Holy Father on issues.<br/><br/>So from my point of view, yes, we need to invest more. But we need to invest more on the local level, and we need to make sure that the proposals from the Pontifical Commission are forwarded to the Holy Father — which normally the President does — and then there is a follow-up process that reflects what we have given as our advice.<br/><br/>In Australia, Catholic Professional Standards Limited is overseeing the Church's response and providing guidelines and support for ensuring all the institutions in the Church are child-safe institutions. Is there a need for some kind of organisational support from Rome for those bishops and dioceses that are struggling to form these institutions and provide safeguarding in those dioceses?<br/><br/>I think ultimately the commission will develop in that line. They are now in the process of hiring experts in those areas.<br/><br/>I think the Church needs to understand that the local churches can learn from each other mutually. And my understanding has always been — and I think the Holy Father has reminded us — that the Church will not function as a centralised company. It does not work like that, effectively. Every bishop, every bishops conference, has, to some extent, its life on its own. What we need to learn more is to open channels of mutual communication.<br/><br/>There are a number of things that people blame for abuse in the Church. As a priest and a psychologist, and as someone who has met and worked with survivors, what are your thoughts on that issue?<br/><br/>I think the question of where does abuse come from is the most important one, and the Pope has addressed that in his letter to the people of God published on 20 August. He says in the first paragraph, and repeats it over and over again, that the question of sexual abuse is always linked — or almost always linked — not only to the question of abuse of power, but also to the abuse of conscience.<br/><br/>So the real fundamental question of abuse is much more complex than just [the question of] sexuality — be it heterosexual or homosexual. It's a power issue, and there we have to really work on the question of how do we understand priesthood, how to we understand bishophood, how do we understand and live out our ministries? What are the boundaries?<br/><br/>That's why I'm very happy that the Jesuit Province in Australia is establishing a Code of Conduct. Because we don't talk only about sexual abuse of minors. We talk about sexual abuse of adults, and we talk about abuse in other ways — like abuse of conscience, where you dictate to someone what you think, or you pretend to know by God, and you can tell another person, 'You need to do that', against the conscience of that person.<br/><br/>Many people think celibacy produces abuse. As I always say, celibacy as such is not cause for abusing — otherwise how do we explain that 99.9 per cent of all abusers do not live a celibate life, and how do we explain that 95 or 96 per cent of all priests do not abuse minors? But, celibacy, or a vow of chastity, that is not really integrated, that is not really lived out properly — yes, that produces a problem. Sometimes people take to drinking, sometime they take to gambling, and sometimes they take to sexual misconduct, with adults and with minors.<br/><br/>The real question about this is how do we deal with the notion of religious spiritual power with which priests and bishops are invested? How can theology help us to understand, and maybe how can sociology, psychology, or business administration help us to define the limits of power, and the necessity of keeping your boundaries | Pytania i odpowiedzi: Ekspert ds. ochrony Watykanu ks. Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>13 czerwca 2021 r.<br/><br/>Ks. Hans Zollner SJ. Zdjęcie: Jezuici australijscy.<br/><br/>Prezes Centrum Ochrony Dzieci na Uniwersytecie Gregoriańskim w Rzymie i członek Papieskiej Komisji Ochrony Nieletnich, ks. Hans Zollner SJ, przebywał w Australii w 2018 roku, aby porozmawiać z przywódcami katolickiej służby i ocalałymi.<br/><br/>Michael McVeigh z Jezuit Communications usiadł z nim podczas wizyty, aby zbadać, jak Kościół reaguje na kryzys nadużyć na arenie międzynarodowej i czego można się nauczyć z naszych doświadczeń w Australii.<br/><br/>MM: To wasza trzecia podróż do Australii. Odwiedziliście kilka innych krajów, aby zobaczyć, jak Kościół reaguje na nadużycia na całym świecie. Czy możecie dać nam jakieś wyobrażenie o tym, jak wygląda światowy obraz?<br/><br/>Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>HZ: Rozumiem, że po odwiedzeniu około 50 krajów na pięciu lub sześciu kontynentach, Kościół naprawdę zaczyna się poruszać w ciągu ostatnich kilku lat w kwestii sprawiedliwości wobec ofiar, słuchania ich i robienia wszystkiego, co można zrobić w zakresie ochrony.<br/><br/>Pod koniec kwietnia byłem z prowincjałami jezuitami z całej Afryki, a przewodniczący asystenta jezuitów Afryki i Madagaskaru jest temu bardzo oddany i oddany. Opracował szczegółowy plan działania na rzecz formacji i wprowadzenia wytycznych na całym terenie. Jest to bardzo staranny i przemyślany wysiłek, aby zrobić wszystko, co można zrobić, aby aktywnie angażować się jako jezuici w Afryce - na kontynencie, gdzie jeszcze kilka lat temu wszystko to było językiem obcym.<br/><br/>Jednym z wyzwań związanych z próbą opracowania tego globalnego podejścia jest to, że mamy do czynienia z tak wieloma kulturami i tak wieloma różnymi zrozumieniami. Jak to połączyć i starać się szkolić i wspierać społeczności religijne w rozwiązywaniu tych problemów?<br/><br/>Myślę, że mogę stymulować dyskusję, stymulować refleksję i przygotowywać ludzi tak bardzo, jak to możliwe, aby mogli wykonać podstawowe prace.<br/><br/>Centrum Ochrony Dziecka na Uniwersytecie Gregoriańskim nie udaje, że ma odpowiedź na każde pytanie. Nie tylko dlatego, że nie znamy konkretnych kontekstów - możemy znać kilka z nich, ale mówimy o tysiącach kultur, mówimy o setkach języków, mówimy o bardzo zróżnicowanym środowisku prawnym. Różni się nawet czasami w jednym kraju, na przykład w Australii, gdzie masz stany w ramach Wspólnoty Australii, które mają inne prawa niż inne stany.<br/><br/>Jestem kimś, kto stara się wywołać i stymulować dyskusję i refleksję. Jestem również bardzo szczęśliwy, aby słuchać ludzi.<br/><br/>Wspomniał pan o potrzebie słuchania ofiar i wspierania ich w byciu wysłuchanymi. Oczywiście mieliśmy tutaj w Australii Królewską Komisję, ale jakie są inne sposoby, w jakie widzieliście, że głosy ofiar są wspierane na całym świecie?<br/><br/>We Francji istnieje jedna diecezja, która ustanowiła to, co nazywają "przestrzenią słuchania". Tam ofiary mogą przyjść i wyrazić siebie. Biskup jest obecny. Jest to otwarta przestrzeń, w której ludzie, którzy zostali ogromnie zranieni, mają przynajmniej swobodę wyrażania tego, o co chcą prosić kierownictwo Kościoła itd.<br/><br/>Są inne miejsca w Stanach Zjednoczonych lub w innych krajach, do których ofiary zostały zaproszone przez diecezje, prowincje, przez kierownictwo Kościoła. Muszę powiedzieć, że ogólnie uważam, że istnieje dobra wola i jest więcej ludzi, takich jak biskupi i prowincjale, którzy słuchają ofiar, niż wiemy. Ale nie ma jednego modelu dawania ofiarom nie tylko przestrzeni do wyrażania siebie i bycia wysłuchanymi, ale także do aktywnego angażowania się w rozwój Kościoła.<br/><br/>Jeśli chodzi o tworzenie przestrzeni dla wsparcia ofiar, jakie są niektóre z rzeczy, które widziałeś, które naprawdę mogłyby pomóc - i które moglibyśmy rozważyć tutaj, w Australii?<br/><br/>Jednym z głównych punktów, które wiele ofiar podnosi, jest: „Czy nie możemy, w obrębie parafii, w obrębie szkół, prowadzić regularnej rozmowy, która obejmuje osoby, które przeżyły nadużycia jako regularni członkowie komisji, komisji, panelu dźwiękowego, grupy feedbackowej lub czegoś w tym stylu?” Tak, że ten głos jest nie tylko wprowadzone w konkretnej okazji, lub gdzie osoba czuje, że on lub ona jest w punkcie, aby móc mówić o tym, ale [jest słyszany] na bieżąco - włączyć ten głos do systemu.<br/><br/>Pomoże to wszystkim nam. Pomoże ocalałym i ofiarom, ponieważ poczują się mile widziani i doceniani w konkretnym doświadczeniu i w konkretnych wyzwaniach życiowych, które przeszli. Po drugie, pomoże to całej wspólnocie, ponieważ możemy przynajmniej stać się bardziej wrażliwi na obawy i szczególne potrzeby ocalałych, które mogą również mówić o potrzebach młodych ludzi.<br/><br/>M: Mamy tutaj w Australii silne grupy ocalałych, którzy byli w stanie wspierać się nawzajem w tym procesie. Ale mówisz, że potrzebujemy jakiegoś sposobu wspierania tych grup, i wspierania tych ludzi, także poprzez nasze własne instytucje?<br/><br/>I myślę, że musimy być kreatywni. Będzie to działać dla jednej szkoły i jednej parafii i jednej diecezji w jeden sposób, a dla innych w inny sposób. Ponieważ ci, którzy przeżyli, z którymi jestem w stałym kontakcie, mają bardzo podobne prośby i podobne doświadczenia, jeśli chodzi o to, czy są przyjmowani w Kościele, czy nie - czują się wyrzuceni lub odrzuceni. Ale oni również mają między sobą zupełnie inne oczekiwania, więc nauczyłem się, że musicie być również bardzo zdolni do zaakceptowania różnic w tym, czego ta konkretna grupa, lub ta konkretna ocalała, chce, żąda i potrzebuje.<br/><br/>M: Ocaleni mówią o tym, że chcą, by ich historie zostały wysłuchane i uznane. Mieliśmy tutaj w Australii Królewską Komisję, która zapewniła niezależny proces, w którym ofiary mogłyby wystąpić. Czy coś takiego jest potrzebne w kontekście prawdy, sprawiedliwości i procesu pojednania dla Kościoła na arenie międzynarodowej?<br/><br/>H: Tak, myślę, że jest to potrzebne na arenie międzynarodowej. Ale myślę, że przede wszystkim każdy lokalny kościół musi odrabiać własne zadania domowe. Nie sądzę, aby stało się to tak szybko, że jakiś taki sobór lub komisja zostanie utworzona, aby zbadać ten obszar dla całego Kościoła. Kościół liczy 1,3 miliarda członków i jest obecny w 190 krajach, z różnymi oczekiwaniami dotyczącymi wsparcia psychologicznego, duchowego i finansowego.<br/><br/>Jest jedna rzecz, na którą natrafiłem konsekwentnie w komunikacji, pracy i słuchaniu ofiar, a mianowicie, że chcą być wysłuchane. Gdyby więc istniało poczucie, że ofiary są stale słuchane – w Rzymie i gdzie indziej – myślę, że przyniosłoby to wielką ulgę wielu ofiarom.<br/><br/>Myślę, że [papież Franciszek] obawia się, zwłaszcza w odniesieniu do waszego pytania, że lokalne kościoły zrobią wszystko, co w ich mocy, aby ofiary były wysłuchane w tym konkretnym kraju. Mam listę osób, które chcą rozmawiać bezpośrednio z Ojcem Świętym, a fizycznie jest to niemożliwe. Byłem tam w 2014 roku, aby przetłumaczyć dla dwóch niemieckich ocalałych, którzy zostali wybrani z dwoma irlandzkimi i dwoma angielskimi ocalałymi, kiedy otrzymał sześciu z nich w domu. Zajął cały ranek słuchając ich jednego po drugim. Dla każdego z nich, był tam przez 40 do 45 minut. Gdyby miał to zrobić dla każdego ocalałego, nie mógł już spać.<br/><br/>Jego przykład jest modelem dla całego Kościoła katolickiego, w jaki sposób ofiary i ocaleni są przyjmowani, przyjmowani i wysłuchani. Myślę, że gdyby biskupi i prowincjale w tym świecie, we wszystkich krajach, poszli za jego przykładem, wielu ocalałych naprawdę by to doceniło.<br/><br/>Arcybiskup Diarmud Martin został niedawno zacytowany tuż przed Światowym Spotkaniem Rodzin, o Papieskiej Komisji, mówiąc, że jest ona zbyt mała, ponieważ jest obecnie stworzona, aby osiągnąć to, co musi osiągnąć. Czy Kościół musi wkładać więcej środków w to, jak nadzoruje te kwestie?<br/><br/>Obecnie jest nas 16 członków z zasadniczo wszystkich kontynentów i głównych grup językowych. Reprezentujemy różne dyscypliny i zawody, a celem komisji – jako statutów, które zostały właśnie ogłoszone przez państwo – jest udzielanie porad Ojcu Świętemu.<br/><br/>Powszechnym nieporozumieniem w sprawie komisji jest przede wszystkim to, że zajmujemy się przypadkami oskarżeń. Nie mamy władzy prawnej ani administracyjnej w sprawach, ponieważ jeśli chodzi o zarzuty nadużyć, sądy i procedury są ustalone.<br/><br/>Drugim nieporozumieniem jest to, że bezpośrednio promujemy sprawy na miejscu. Naszym pierwszym i najważniejszym celem jest doradzanie Ojcu Świętemu w sprawach.<br/><br/>Z mojego punktu widzenia, tak, musimy zainwestować więcej. Musimy jednak zainwestować więcej na szczeblu lokalnym i upewnić się, że propozycje Komisji Papieskiej zostaną przekazane Ojcu Świętemu – co zwykle robi Prezydent – a następnie nastąpi proces kontynuacji, który odzwierciedla to, co daliśmy jako naszą radę.<br/><br/>W Australii Catholic Professional Standards Limited nadzoruje reakcję Kościoła i zapewnia wytyczne i wsparcie dla zapewnienia, że wszystkie instytucje w Kościele są instytucjami bezpiecznymi dla dzieci. Czy istnieje potrzeba jakiegoś wsparcia organizacyjnego ze strony Rzymu dla tych biskupów i diecezji, którzy walczą o utworzenie tych instytucji i zapewnienie ochrony w tych diecezjach?<br/><br/>Sądzę, że ostatecznie komisja rozwinie się w tym kierunku. Obecnie są w trakcie rekrutacji ekspertów w tych dziedzinach.<br/><br/>Myślę, że Kościół musi zrozumieć, że Kościoły lokalne mogą uczyć się od siebie nawzajem, a moje zrozumienie zawsze było – i myślę, że Ojciec Święty nam przypomniał – że Kościół nie będzie funkcjonował jako scentralizowane społeczeństwo. Nie działa to w ten sposób, skutecznie. Każdy biskup, każda konferencja biskupów ma w pewnym stopniu swoje własne życie. To, czego musimy się więcej nauczyć, to otworzyć kanały wzajemnej komunikacji.<br/><br/>Jest wiele rzeczy, które ludzie obwiniają za nadużycia w Kościele. Jako ksiądz i psycholog, i jako ktoś, kto spotkał się i pracował z ocalałymi, co myślisz na ten temat?<br/><br/>Myślę, że pytanie, skąd się biorą nadużycia, jest najważniejsze i Papież odniósł się do tego w swoim liście do ludu Bożego opublikowanym 20 sierpnia. W pierwszym akapicie mówi i powtarza to wielokrotnie, że kwestia wykorzystywania seksualnego jest zawsze związana – lub prawie zawsze – nie tylko z kwestią nadużycia władzy, ale także z nadużyciem sumienia.<br/><br/>Prawdziwa zasadnicza kwestia nadużyć jest więc o wiele bardziej złożona niż tylko kwestia seksualności – czy to heteroseksualna, czy homoseksualna. Jest to kwestia władzy, a tam naprawdę musimy pracować nad pytaniem, jak rozumieć kapłaństwo, jak rozumieć biskupstwo, jak rozumieć i realizować nasze posługi? Jakie są granice?<br/><br/>Dlatego bardzo się cieszę, że jezuicka prowincja w Australii ustanawia Kodeks Postępowania, ponieważ nie mówimy tylko o molestowaniu seksualnym nieletnich. Mówimy o molestowaniu seksualnym dorosłych i mówimy o molestowaniu na inne sposoby — jak na przykład nadużycia sumienia, gdzie dyktujesz komuś, co myślisz, lub udajesz, że wiesz od Boga, i możesz powiedzieć innej osobie: „Musisz to zrobić”, wbrew sumieniu tej osoby.<br/><br/>Wiele osób uważa, że celibat prowadzi do nadużyć. Jak zawsze mówię, celibat jako taki nie jest powodem do nadużyć – w przeciwnym razie jak wytłumaczyć, że 99,9 procent wszystkich nadużyć nie prowadzi życia w celibacie i jak wytłumaczyć, że 95 lub 96 procent wszystkich księży nie nadużywa nieletnich? Ale celibat, czy ślub czystości, który nie jest tak naprawdę zintegrowany, który nie jest właściwie przeżyty — tak, to powoduje problem. Czasami ludzie podejmują się picia, czasami hazardu, a czasami dopuszczają się niewłaściwych zachowań seksualnych, zarówno z dorosłymi, jak i z nieletnimi.<br/><br/>Prawdziwym pytaniem w tej sprawie jest to, w jaki sposób mamy do czynienia z pojęciem religijnej władzy duchowej, z którą obdarzani są kapłani i biskupi? Jak teologia może nam pomóc zrozumieć, a może jak socjologia, psychologia lub administracja biznesowa mogą nam pomóc określić granice władzy i konieczność utrzymywania swoich granic? |
| I'm not surprised by this mismatch. In fact, I'd even go so far as to say this isn't something that will ever change, nor should we get all steamed up about changing it. In 10 years, we'll still have bleeding edge, complex items in the biggest concerns list, and the things we're finally getting around to understanding will be the major parts of our spending.<br/><br/>Now, Gunnar and Andy both have excellent points, specifically about IT teams seeing IT problems and solving them with IT solutions; in fact, I'm positive their points hold merit.<br/><br/>But I think there are other ideas that trump those (I did comment on their blogs about it, and later decided I should just blog here). Those top 3 concerns are bleedingly new such that:<br/><br/>we fear new things because we don't understand them, or don't understand them because they're new.<br/><br/>they're too new for us to have solid approaches to handling them.<br/><br/>they're too new for us to know if we should be worried or not! we tend to default to paranoid/worried, which is good!<br/><br/>too new to have obvious budget items assigned to them. Can I buy a box or some software that provide "cloud security" or "social media security?"<br/><br/>they're so new the business doesn't even know how to use them or what they want out of them. Let alone how we can secure them while still meeting or at least not stomping all over business needs. If the business doesn't even know how to use them yet, I'm not sure security is in any position to guide that usage securely.<br/><br/>It also should be mentioned that these new things are being largely pushed via consumerland and into the business, with IT as a sort of, "Oh yeah," thought. Firewalls, AV, AM, Auth are all IT responses to typically IT issues. Of course there is a difference there. They're also very subjective issues, as opposed to very objective items like firewalls, known malicious bits, behaviors, signatures, ports. Business presents very complex issues that are often involving people (which we can't patch) and that often don't fit nicely into blanket rules. Even if we turned away from technical solutions and devoted our time into solving these problems, they are still not going to be neatly solved. Likewise, when push comes to shove, can you have and meet goals with firewalls? Can you show improvement? All of this flows from the rather subjective non-technical aspect of those issues. Sort of the difference between a child's report card and the feedback you get from a parent-teacher conference. If you have a child, which one would you be most inclined to disagree with or not necessarily believe? (The answer is the subjective one!)<br/><br/>It could be said this is the natural progression of security and technology: from shoring up the technical controls to moving up the stack towards behavior and people. Sure, these 3 top concerns can be said to punch through firewalls and network segments, but that's the nature of those things (social media "punching" through a firewall is far different than me punching through an SSH connection to bridge my home network; social media is akin to the *way* I use my SSH connection after the hold is already punched because it is needed; i.e. social media is the way port 80 is used.)<br/><br/>Basically, all indications point to not being surprised by this dichotomy. And I don't think this is some further indication that IT/security is doing it wrong, or isn't aligned properly with business, or has a technical dark-server-room background. I'm not saying we're doing things right or we're properly aligned, but the above isn't a good argument to support the theory of those deficiencies.<br/><br/>Now for a really big jump. I'd liken the current increase in mobile computing to be as big as the introduction of computers into the business and later the PC/internet into business. Now, I wasn't around when the former happened, nor was I in the industry when the personal computer revolution swept into business, but I would bet that is the closest comparison so far. I may even say the same for social media. These are damned new and they're big changes beyond just bringing in Macs or new software or some new business process. | Nie jestem zaskoczony tą rozbieżnością. W rzeczywistości, nawet posunąłbym się tak daleko, że powiedziałbym, że to nie jest coś, co się kiedykolwiek zmieni, ani nie powinniśmy się wkurzać na zmianę. Za 10 lat nadal będziemy mieli krwawiącą krawędź, złożone pozycje na liście największych obaw, a rzeczy, które w końcu dojdziemy do zrozumienia, będą głównymi elementami naszych wydatków.<br/><br/>Gunnar i Andy mają świetne punkty, szczególnie w odniesieniu do zespołów IT, które widzą problemy IT i rozwiązują je za pomocą rozwiązań IT; w rzeczywistości jestem pewien, że ich punkty mają wartość.<br/><br/>Ale myślę, że są inne pomysły, które je przebijają (komentowałem na ich blogach, a później postanowiłem, że powinienem po prostu blogować tutaj). Te 3 największe obawy są krwawienie nowe, takie, że:<br/><br/>boimy się nowych rzeczy, ponieważ ich nie rozumiemy lub nie rozumiemy ich, ponieważ są nowe.<br/><br/>Są zbyt nowi, abyśmy mieli solidne podejście do ich obsługi.<br/><br/>są zbyt nowi, aby wiedzieć, czy powinniśmy się martwić, czy nie! mamy tendencję do domyślnego do paranoi / martwić, co jest dobre!<br/><br/>zbyt nowy, aby mieć przypisane do nich oczywiste pozycje budżetowe. Czy mogę kupić pudełko lub jakieś oprogramowanie, które zapewnia "bezpieczeństwo w chmurze" lub "bezpieczeństwo mediów społecznościowych"?<br/><br/>Są one tak nowe, że firma nawet nie wie, jak z nich korzystać ani czego od nich chcą. Nie mówiąc już o tym, jak możemy je zabezpieczyć, gdy nadal spełniamy lub przynajmniej nie zatykamy wszystkich potrzeb biznesowych. Jeśli firma jeszcze nie wie, jak z nich korzystać, nie jestem pewien, czy bezpieczeństwo jest w stanie bezpiecznie kierować tym użyciem.<br/><br/>Należy również wspomnieć, że te nowe rzeczy są w dużej mierze przesuwane przez kraj konsumencki i do biznesu, z IT jako rodzaj "o tak", myślałem. Firewalle, AV, AM, Auth to wszystkie odpowiedzi IT na typowe problemy IT. Oczywiście jest różnica. Są to również bardzo subiektywne kwestie, w przeciwieństwie do bardzo obiektywnych elementów, takich jak firewalle, znane złośliwe bity, zachowania, sygnatury, porty. Biznes przedstawia bardzo złożone kwestie, które często dotyczą ludzi (których nie możemy naprawić) i które często nie pasują ładnie do ogólnych zasad. Nawet jeśli odwrócimy się od rozwiązań technicznych i poświęcimy czas na rozwiązywanie tych problemów, nadal nie będą one starannie rozwiązywane. Podobnie, kiedy przychodzi push, czy można mieć i realizować cele za pomocą firewallów? Czy można wykazać poprawę? Wszystko to wynika z raczej subiektywnego, nietechnicznego aspektu tych zagadnień. Jakaś różnica między kartą raportu dziecka a informacjami zwrotnymi, które otrzymujesz z konferencji rodzic-nauczyciel. Jeśli masz dziecko, które z nich byłoby najbardziej skłonne do nie zgadzać się z lub niekoniecznie wierzyć? (Odpowiedź jest subiektywna!)<br/><br/>Można powiedzieć, że jest to naturalny postęp bezpieczeństwa i technologii: od wzmocnienia kontroli technicznej do przejścia w górę w kierunku zachowania i ludzi. Oczywiście, te 3 główne obawy można powiedzieć, aby przebić przez zapory sieciowe i segmenty sieciowe, ale taka jest natura tych rzeczy (media społecznościowe "przebicie" przez zaporę jest znacznie inne niż przebicie przez połączenie SSH, aby pomostować moją sieć domową; media społecznościowe są podobne do * sposobu * Używam mojego połączenia SSH po tym, jak wstrzymywanie jest już przebite, ponieważ jest to potrzebne; tj.<br/><br/>Zasadniczo wszystkie wskazania wskazują na to, że ta dychotomia nie jest zaskoczona. I nie sądzę, że jest to kolejny sygnał, że IT / bezpieczeństwo robi to źle, lub nie jest odpowiednio dopasowane do biznesu, lub ma techniczne tło ciemnego serwera. Nie twierdzę, że robimy wszystko dobrze lub jesteśmy odpowiednio wyrównani, ale powyższe nie jest dobrym argumentem na poparcie teorii tych niedociągnięć.<br/><br/>Teraz naprawdę duży skok. Chciałbym, aby obecny wzrost mobilnych komputerów był tak duży, jak wprowadzenie komputerów do biznesu, a później PC / Internetu do biznesu. Nie było mnie w pobliżu, kiedy zdarzyło się to pierwsze, ani też nie było mnie w branży, kiedy rewolucja komputerów osobistych wkroczyła w biznes, ale założę się, że jest to najbliższe porównanie do tej pory. Mogę nawet powiedzieć to samo dla mediów społecznościowych. Są to cholernie nowe i są to wielkie zmiany wykraczające poza wprowadzenie Maców lub nowego oprogramowania lub nowego procesu biznesowego. |
