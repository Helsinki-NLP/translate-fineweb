| The Masterpiece: a Chain Poetry Challenge<br/><br/>John has been writing poetry since his school days. He was awarded the "Best Poet 2014 and 2021" Hubby Awards.<br/><br/>Madame Monet in a Japanese kimono, 1875<br/><br/>Claude Monet [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>A Brief History of Collaborative, Collective, or Chain Poetry<br/><br/>Collaborative,collective, or chain poetry is an alternative and creative technique for writing poetry by more than one person. The principal aim of this type of poetry is to create poems through the collaboration of various authors/poets, trying to form a unified voice while still maintain their individual voices.<br/><br/>Examples of collaboration abound in Japanese poetry. Though the precise accounts and records of many such events are either lost or missing.<br/><br/>One of the most famous examples of collective poetry writing was the poem collection titled Ralentir Travaux by Surrealist French poets André Breton, Paul Éluard and René Char. These three poets collaborated to write the poems in this collection over just five days in 1930.<br/><br/>During the 1940s, Charles Henri Ford, an American poet, invented what he called the "chain poem", where each poet wrote a line and then sent the poem to another person (to continue) in another part of the world, by post.<br/><br/>In 2007 a collection of American collaborative poetry Saints of Hysteria: A Half-Century of Collaborative American Poetry was edited and published by Denise Duhamel, Maureen Seaton and David Trinidad.<br/><br/>Collaborative poetry writing has been used in schools and colleges to teach students teamwork and to discover ways in which they are connected.(source: Wikipedia)<br/><br/>Study of a Figure Outdoors: Woman with a Parasol, facing left, 1886<br/><br/>Claude Monet [Public domain or Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>The Aim of This Article and How to Approach the Challenge<br/><br/>A few years back I wrote an article called "Poem Without an End" which included a Christmas poem I had written that lent itself to being added to. I was amazed by the response as at that stage I only had a few followers here. People wrote a stanza of poetry each in "comments" on the hub to follow on from the previous commenter's stanza. It worked out very well and at the end I compiled all the contributions into a single poem as part of the hub.<br/><br/>Similar challenges have been issued since, including one by Frank Atanacio called "Spirits Sat as Mourners" that was also very successful. The difference being that in that instance contributors wrote their own hubs for their stanza of poetry and placed a link on Frank's original hub.<br/><br/>For this particular challenge I don't expect everyone to spend valuable time writing separate hubs for one stanza of poetry (unless you really want to). The main problem being that to make it effective you would have to copy the previously written parts of the poem onto your hub and would probably be hit with "duplication" label.<br/><br/>So, that being the case, and also to save having to leave links everywhere, I just ask that anyone who wants to take part just write their stanza here in "comments." Check the last comment before yours that is contributing to the challenge and follow on. If I see more than one following from the same stanza I will use my poetic licence to work them in as I deem best.<br/><br/>At some stage when I feel there has been enough stanzas added I will probably call an end to the challenge and then compile them all together as the completed poem as part of the article (also giving credit to each contributor).<br/><br/>Flowered Riverbank, Argenteuil<br/><br/>Claude Monet [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>The Challenge!<br/><br/>Now comes the interesting part. If you join this chain poetry challenge you have to try to keep the style and voice of the poem as close as possible to the preceding verses, so that to uninformed readers it will appear that only one author has written the entire poem.<br/><br/>Sounds easy, you say? Well maybe it would be if the poem had a traditional style, rhyme or meter. But this one doesn't! The poem you will be adding to was started by an acquaintance of mine Andriealphus as a "chain poem challenge" elsewhere. At the time of writing I was the only other person who had accepted the challenge, and because I loved the subject I thought it would be a great challenge for my fellow writers and decided to use it here and see if the response would be better. (I know of a few poets here whose writing would suit this style)<br/><br/>Rules :<br/><br/>Follow on from the previous stanza in comments<br/><br/>Try to retain the voice and style of the poem<br/><br/>Keep your stanza/verse to approximately the same length as those before<br/><br/>Claude Monet was one of the most famous painters in the history of art and a leading figure in the Impressionist movement.<br/><br/>In 1883 Monet moved to Giverny. Here, he loved to paint outdoors in the gardens that he helped create. The water lilies found in the pond had a particular appeal, and he painted several series of them throughout the rest of his life; the Japanese-style bridge over the pond became the subject of several works, as well.<br/><br/>In 1912 Monet painted a series of 12 waterlily paintings commissioned by the Orangerie des Tuileries, a museum in Paris. He chose to make them on a very large scale, and to serve as a "haven of peaceful meditation." This project consumed much of Monet's later years. Monet once stated, "These landscapes of water and reflection have become an obsession for me. It is beyond my strength as an old man, and yet I want to render what I feel."<br/><br/>His health was now an obstacle, as well. Nearly blind, with both of his eyes seriously affected by cataracts, Monet finally agreed to undergo surgery for the ailment in 1923.<br/><br/>Monet's famous water lilies turned redder as his cataracts progressed. After getting corrective surgery he destroyed most of the "red lily" paintings, angry that no one really mentioned it to him. Ironically, these paintings were probably what made his impressionistic style so famous in that time -- artists started taking more risks with color and such during this point. (source: biography.com)<br/><br/>The Masterpiece<br/><br/>"The boy sitting behind you says you look like a masterpiece.<br/><br/>Ask him, has he ever seen a Monet up close?<br/><br/>Close enough to see nothing but muddled strokes of weedy lakeshore?<br/><br/>Close enough to dip his fingers into the ridges<br/><br/>where oil paints hardened under an artist's gaze?<br/><br/>Close enough to breathe onto the blood lilies?<br/><br/>Ask him, why did he paint them red?" (Andriealphus)<br/><br/>He grinned like Carroll's cheshire cat.<br/><br/>"Through clouded and bloodshot eyes I imagine.<br/><br/>Be my waterlilies!" he says,<br/><br/>"Feel my breath and let my fingers delve,<br/><br/>become my masterpiece instead.<br/><br/>A brush has never touched a canvas as fine as your fair skin.<br/><br/>Let the masters weep in jealousy,<br/><br/>and Van Gogh slice his ear in envy at the beauty of your nakedness."(Jodah)<br/><br/>Self portrait with bandaged ear<br/><br/>Vincent van Gogh [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>Responses<br/><br/>Now it's your turn. Please write your response in the comments below, remembering to check those immediately before yours for the last written stanza of the poem. If you do decide to write a separate hub for your stanza of verse, make sure you leave a link here in comments.<br/><br/>The Finished Masterpiece<br/><br/>All contributions have been received and I have put the finished poem together with only some slight edits. I hope everyone is happy with the result. If you think I could improve the order of stanzas etc, feel free to let me know.<br/><br/>Comments<br/><br/>Hey Diana, looks like I have to go add another stanza to the finished poem :)<br/><br/>Thanks for this contribution.Quite beautiful.<br/><br/>Diana L Pierce from Potter County, Pa. on September 19, 2015:<br/><br/>No tears splash water below,<br/><br/>From the bridge beneath his feet,<br/><br/>Nor can his brush paint his thoughts,<br/><br/>From the mystery maid he seeks.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 21, 2015:<br/><br/>Thank you Cris, I am sure everyone appreciates your comment.

And the beauty we can still enjoy today from all his work.<br/><br/>This is a great challenge! I am really looking forward to adding to this.<br/><br/>I first wanted to stop in and let you know that, up for sure. Shared too.<br/><br/>And thank you so much for all the challenges to help the rest of us, keep our mental energy flowing and giving it a work out! You are the best.<br/><br/>The information about LuLu and the free ISBN number is an answered prayer! So, smile my friend. You are a gift!<br/><br/>Hugs. :-)<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 12, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi again Marj. I think I may have all the verses that are going to come. I have been doing my best to arrange them as I think best with just a little editing. I will probably post the finished poem as a separate hub with a link on this one to it. My book is available on Lulu and iBooks...there's a link on one of the earlier comments. I'd really appreciate it if you were to purhase a copy. Bear in mind it's my first eBook so the formatting etc isn't perfect, but it's taken me seven revisions I think to get it where it is. It will all be easier next time. If you need help let me know.<br/><br/>travmaj from australia on August 12, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi John, you have certainly had some excellent responses to your challenge - I'm sure you'll fuse it altogether beautifully although I imagine a difficult task. I'm interested in your poetry books also - I really have to get my act together technologically - I'll try and check it all out...cheers -<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi Jo, both books 'On the Wings of Eagles" and "I Laughed a Smile" have mostly the same content...except the former has one extra poem. Originally they were in different formats, one ePub, the other PDF but now they are both ePub. They are available through Lulu and iBooks, soon Barnes and Noble and Nook (not Amazon). I may try publishing another book through Amazon soon just to see how it compares. Thanks again.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>John, thanks a lot, the info on publishing with Lulu will be quite useful as I'm thinking of publishing but I'm currently torn between Amazon and Lulu. I wanted to purchase one of your books, but I couldn't seem to find them on Amazon. However, I'll probably get it from Lulu. Wishing you every success, you deserve it.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Hey Phyllis, thanks for ontributing. I like it, a perfect ending to the poem I think.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks Faith.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi Jo, I think I have sorted out the poem satisfactorily. Just waiting to see if there is any more to add. Publishing with Lulu wasn't bad and now that I've done it once it will be easier next time. Getting the formatting to look right in the eBook was the hardest, though you and just type it in a word document and Lulu automatically produces the contents page and converts the document to ePub or PDF you can only use certain fonts and have to make sure the chapter names or poem titles are in Heading 1. They also provide a free ISBN number if you want. Overall it was easier than expected however.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Phyllis, this is succinct and beautiful, I love it. Shyron's did an excellent job also, I thought I'd already commented on her verse, but I hadn't.<br/><br/>Phyllis Doyle Burns from High desert of Nevada. on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Wonderful hub, great idea, Jodah. Here is one from me. Short but sweet. Hope it is okay:<br/><br/>And this the beauty be<br/><br/>From Masters past we see<br/><br/>Impressed upon the boy<br/><br/>Bestowed on her with joy<br/><br/>Faith Reaper from southern USA on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks John and Jo. You are kind. Jo, you have always been a brilliant poet. I, too, am looking forward to the end result after John does his magic to pull it all together.<br/><br/>I will share again to see if there are any more takers.<br/><br/>Blessings<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Faith, beautifully done, I find it incredible how someone with such limited vision can teach us so much about beauty, light and shadows. John, looking forward to reading the end result.<br/><br/>By the way, congtats on publishing your poems. How did you find the process of publishing with Lulu?<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks for your great submission Faith. No it's not too late, I'm still compiling the final poem so it should be up for all to see in a day or two.<br/><br/>Faith Reaper from southern USA on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi John,<br/><br/>I apologize for my late submission here to your wonderful challenge. I am off from work a couple of day and decided to give this a go while my husband is resting from knee surgery. If it does not meet with your standards, please feel free to not use it in your final poem or edit as you deem necessary.<br/><br/>Blessings always<br/><br/>Here it goes:<br/><br/>Confessions to friend Georges Clemenceau<br/><br/>Of light encapsulating both torment, joy<br/><br/>Fervent madness in analyzing colors<br/><br/>Consequential spontaneous creations<br/><br/>Season after season of obsession<br/><br/>Capturing different hues in a single moment<br/><br/>Attentive while strolling in Argenteuill<br/><br/>Brushwork bares masterpiece.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 09, 2015:<br/><br/>Just a shout out to see if anyone else still wants to contribute to this chain poem.

Thanks to all who have contributed.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 02, 2015:<br/><br/>Thank you Genna. It appears Monet is a favourite arist of many here. I hope you'll take part in this challenge too :)<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 02, 2015:<br/><br/>Thank you for a great contribution Shyron. This is a very nice verse. Well done.<br/><br/>Genna East from Massachusetts, USA on August 02, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi John...<br/><br/>I started to read this wonderful challenge (Monet is one of my favorite artists), then came back to finish reading some of the beautiful contributions that give this painting a stunning voice through perception and the senses.

I'm so glad you like my contribution. This is a very good idea, I know you'll have fun putting it all together. Take care and my best to you.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks Deb, yes I am impressed by the standard of submissions. I'm looking forward to putting it all together.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Yes Ann, it is good to see the poets among us take up the challenge with some great contributions so far. I just hope Imcan do it justice when it comes to putting it together.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Well done Jo. The word "sublime" comes to mind. I hoped all the poets would rise to the fore, and they have. Love it, thanks for contributing.<br/><br/>Deb Hirt from Stillwater, OK on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>I am excited to see what you end up with here. There are a number of fine poets rising to the challenge, so go to it!<br/><br/>Ann Carr from SW England on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Great one, Jo!<br/><br/>You've got everyone going, John! Rather you than me, putting all this together, but it's going to be a humdinger of a poem when it finally comes to an end - if it ever does! You've really started something.<br/><br/>Ann<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Ok, John here goes nothing! Following from Kim's. I hope it reads well.<br/><br/>And the boy began to walk away<br/><br/>But in his wake, I heard him say<br/><br/>"I took a trip to Orangerie<br/><br/>Where the ghost of Monet still abides<br/><br/>I sat right down and gazed awhile<br/><br/>Until I heard a soft voice cry.<br/><br/>"Have you ever seen a fluid dream?<br/><br/>Where light evolves into what it touch<br/><br/>Where serenity flows through cloudy veil<br/><br/>Where the magician's brush like lightening rush<br/><br/>Have you ever seen a sight sublime?<br/><br/>A child born of distorted illusion<br/><br/>This flowering pond that traps the light<br/><br/>That lift the heart and beckons the soul<br/><br/>An abstract pulchritude up close<br/><br/>Move back, behold; such tranquil delight."<br/><br/>I hope this is in line with what the others have done. Feel free to edit if needed. My best...<br/><br/>Jo.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Alrighty!<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Yes Jo, please do. Anyone is welcome to do more than one stanza. I may add another myself at some stage.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>John, I've decided to have a go, but it's about 16 lines, can I do it in two stanzas following on from Kim's wonderful submission? You can always edit it later.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on July 31, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi Jo, sorry to hear you are under the weather at the moment. I am not in a hurry to close this challenge so I'll keep it open until you are back firing on all cylinders and are able to contribute. You are one of the hubbers I was looking forward to getting a response from as I thought it would suit. Thank you for your kind words, and get well soon.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on July 31, 2015:<br/><br/>Wow! John I can't believe I almost missed your incredible challenged. This is something in which I would have loved to participate since Claude Monet is one of my all times favourite artist. Unfortunately, I must cry off. I'm a bit under the weather with a head full of cotton wool, or so it seems. If the challenge is still open when I get rid of this pesky flu I may give it a go, but I must say, the standard is exceptionally high. Maj took it to another level but all the submissions are brilliant. Kudos to you Andriealphus and the other writers who participated so far in this artistic and creative masterpiece.<br/><br/>My best always Jo.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on July 31, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi again Maj, glad this poem inspired you, and yes it beats watching the cricket especially with the Aussie batsmen performing badly in this third test. It will be an interesting exercise for me to fuse all the stanzas together but should be good.<br/><br/>travmaj from australia on July 30, 2015:<br/><br/>John, thank you, I'm most happy you like my offering. I found the poem intriguing and suddenly felt inspired to write my version in the same mode. I'm not sure I wrote a continuation from the stanza before (alwaysexploring) but I'm sure you will fuse it altogether when the time comes. Love all the responses. I haven't managed any creative writing for yonks, can't wait now to start over, just need some time. (beats watching the cricket too!!!) Cheers John, will be checking in -<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on July 30, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks for checking Dana. I am pleased with the quality of responses so far. I just have to wait and see how many more come in. The final,poem should be great.<br/><br/>Dana Tate from LOS ANGELES on July 30, 2015:<br/><br/>Just checking in to see how things are going, I can't wait for the finished product.

Otrzymał nagrodę "Best Poet 2014 and 2021" Hubby Awards.<br/><br/>Madame Monet w japońskim kimonie, 1875<br/><br/>Claude Monet [domena publiczna], przez Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>Krótka historia poezji kolaboratywnej, zbiorowej lub łańcuchowej<br/><br/>Poezja kolaboracyjna, zbiorowa lub łańcuchowa jest alternatywną i twórczą techniką pisania poezji przez więcej niż jedną osobę. Głównym celem tego typu poezji jest tworzenie wierszy poprzez współpracę różnych autorów/poetów, starając się tworzyć jednolity głos przy jednoczesnym zachowaniu ich indywidualnych głosów.<br/><br/>Przykłady współpracy obfitują w japońską poezję. Chociaż dokładne relacje i zapisy wielu takich wydarzeń są utracone lub zaginione.<br/><br/>Jednym z najbardziej znanych przykładów zbiorowego pisania poezji był zbiór wierszy zatytułowany Ralentir Travaux surrealistycznych francuskich poetów André Breton, Paul Éluard i René Char. Ci trzej poeci współpracowali, aby napisać wiersze w tej kolekcji w ciągu zaledwie pięciu dni w 1930 roku.<br/><br/>W latach 40. amerykański poeta Charles Henri Ford wynalazł to, co nazwał „wierszem łańcuchowym”, w którym każdy poeta napisał wiersz, a następnie wysłał wiersz do innej osoby (do kontynuowania) w innej części świata, pocztą.<br/><br/>W 2007 roku zbiór amerykańskiej poezji kolaboratywnej Saints of Hysteria: A Half-Century of Collaborative American Poetry został wydany i wydany przez Denise Duhamel, Maureen Seaton i Davida Trinidada.<br/><br/>Wspólne pisanie poezji zostało wykorzystane w szkołach i kolegiach, aby nauczyć uczniów pracy zespołowej i odkryć sposoby, w jakie są połączone.<br/><br/>Study of a Figure Outdoors: Kobieta z parasolem, zwrócona w lewo, 1886<br/><br/>Claude Monet [domena publiczna lub domena publiczna], za pośrednictwem Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>Cel tego artykułu i jak podejść do wyzwania<br/><br/>Kilka lat temu napisałem artykuł zatytułowany "Poem Without an End", który zawierał świąteczny wiersz, który napisałem, który uległ dodaniu. Byłem zaskoczony odpowiedzią, ponieważ na tym etapie miałem tu tylko kilku zwolenników. Ludzie pisali strofy poezji każdy w "komentarze" na hub, aby podążać za strofą poprzedniego komentatora. To działało bardzo dobrze i na koniec zebrałem wszystkie wkłady w jeden wiersz jako część hub.<br/><br/>Podobne wyzwania zostały wydane od tego czasu, w tym jeden przez Frank Atanacio zatytułowany "Spirits Sat as Mourners", który również był bardzo udany. Różnica polega na tym, że w tym przypadku współpracownicy napisali własne ośrodki poezji i umieścili link do oryginalnego ośrodka Franka.<br/><br/>W tym konkretnym wyzwaniu nie oczekuję, że każdy będzie spędzał cenny czas na pisaniu oddzielnych hubów dla jednej strofy poezji (chyba że naprawdę tego chcesz). Głównym problemem jest to, że aby uczynić go skutecznym musiałbyś skopiować wcześniej napisane części wiersza na swój hub i prawdopodobnie trafiłbyś na etykietę "duplikacja".<br/><br/>Tak więc, ponieważ tak jest, a także aby zaoszczędzić na zostawianiu linków wszędzie, proszę tylko, aby każdy, kto chce wziąć udział, napisał swoją stronę tutaj w "komentarze". Sprawdź ostatni komentarz przed swoim, który przyczynia się do wyzwania i kontynuuj. Jeśli zobaczę więcej niż jedną z tych samych stron, użyję mojej poetyckiej licencji, aby je opracować tak, jak uważam za najlepsze.<br/><br/>Na pewnym etapie, kiedy czuję, że dodano wystarczającą ilość strof, prawdopodobnie zakończę wyzwanie, a następnie skompiluję je wszystkie razem jako ukończony wiersz w ramach artykułu (również oddając cześć każdemu z autorów).<br/><br/>Kwiatowy brzeg rzeki, Argenteuil<br/><br/>Claude Monet [domena publiczna], przez Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>Wyzwanie!<br/><br/>Teraz przychodzi interesująca część. Jeśli dołączysz do tego wyzwania poezji łańcuchowej, musisz starać się zachować styl i głos wiersza jak najbliżej poprzednich wersetów, aby niepoinformowanym czytelnikom wydawało się, że tylko jeden autor napisał cały wiersz.<br/><br/>Brzmi łatwo, mówisz? Cóż, może byłoby, gdyby wiersz miał tradycyjny styl, rym lub metr. Ale ten nie! Wiersz, do którego będziesz dodawał, został zapoczątkowany przez znajomego mojego Andriealphusa jako "wyzwanie wiersza łańcuchowego" gdzie indziej. W momencie pisania byłam jedyną osobą, która przyjęła to wyzwanie, a ponieważ podobał mi się temat, pomyślałam, że będzie to wielkie wyzwanie dla moich kolegów pisarzy i postanowiłam użyć go tutaj i sprawdzić, czy odpowiedź będzie lepsza. (Znam kilku poetów, których pisanie pasowałoby do tego stylu)<br/><br/>Zasady:<br/><br/>Kontynuuj poprzednią tanzę w komentarzach<br/><br/>Staraj się zachować głos i styl wiersza<br/><br/>Zachowaj swoją strofę / werset w przybliżeniu taką samą długość, jak poprzednie<br/><br/>Claude Monet był jednym z najsłynniejszych malarzy w historii sztuki i wiodącą postacią w ruchu impresjonistycznym.<br/><br/>W 1883 roku Monet przeniósł się do Giverny, gdzie uwielbiał malować na świeżym powietrzu w ogrodach, które pomógł stworzyć. Lilie wodne znalezione w stawie miały szczególny pociąg, a on namalował kilka serii z nich przez resztę swojego życia; most w stylu japońskim nad stawem stał się przedmiotem kilku prac, jak również.<br/><br/>W 1912 roku Monet namalował serię 12 liliowych obrazów na zamówienie muzeum Orangerie des Tuileries w Paryżu. Wybrał je na bardzo dużą skalę i służył jako „przystań spokojnej medytacji”. Ten projekt pochłonął wiele późniejszych lat Moneta. Monet powiedział kiedyś: "Te krajobrazy wody i odbicia stały się dla mnie obsesją. To przekracza moje siły jako starca, a mimo to chcę oddać to, co czuję."<br/><br/>Prawie ślepy, z obu oczu poważnie dotkniętych zaćmą, Monet w końcu zgodził się na operację z powodu choroby w 1923 roku.<br/><br/>Słynne lilie wodne Moneta stały się bardziej czerwone, gdy zaćma postępowała. Po operacji korygującej zniszczył większość obrazów "czerwonych lilii", wściekły, że nikt mu o tym nie wspomniał. Jak na ironię, te obrazy były prawdopodobnie tym, co sprawiło, że jego impresjonistyczny styl był tak sławny w tamtych czasach - artyści zaczęli podejmować większe ryzyko z kolorem i tym podobnym w tym momencie. (źródło: biography.com)<br/><br/>arcydzieło<br/><br/>Chłopiec siedzący za tobą mówi, że wyglądasz jak arcydzieło.<br/><br/>Zapytaj go, czy kiedykolwiek widział Moneta z bliska?<br/><br/>Wystarczająco blisko, by zobaczyć tylko zamieszane skoki chwastowego brzegu jeziora?<br/><br/>Wystarczająco blisko, aby zanurzyć palce w grzbietach<br/><br/>Gdzie farby olejne utwardzają się pod okiem artysty?<br/><br/>Wystarczająco blisko, by oddychać liliami krwi?<br/><br/>Zapytaj go, dlaczego pomalował je na czerwono?" (Andriealphus)<br/><br/>Uśmiechnął się jak kot z Cheshire Carrolla.<br/><br/>"Przez zamglone i zakrwawione oczy, jak sobie wyobrażam.<br/><br/>Bądźcie moimi wodnymi liliami!” – mówi.<br/><br/>"Poczuj mój oddech i pozwól moim palcom płynąć,<br/><br/>Zamiast tego stań się moim arcydziełem.<br/><br/>Szczotka nigdy nie dotknęła płótna tak dobrze jak twoja jasna skóra.<br/><br/>Niech panowie płaczą w zazdrości,<br/><br/>A Van Gogh podciął sobie ucho w zazdrości o piękno twojej nagości.<br/><br/>Autoportret z bandażem ucha<br/><br/>Vincent van Gogh [domena publiczna], przez Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>Odpowiedzi<br/><br/>Teraz twoja kolej.

Robiłem wszystko, co w mojej mocy, aby je zorganizować, jak myślę, że najlepiej z tylko trochę edycji. Prawdopodobnie opublikuję gotowy wiersz jako oddzielny hub z linkiem na ten jeden do niego. Moja książka jest dostępna na Lulu i iBooks... istnieje link do jednego z wcześniejszych komentarzy. Naprawdę doceniłbym, gdybyś chciał kupić kopię. Pamiętaj, że to moja pierwsza książka elektroniczna, więc formatowanie itp. Nie jest idealne, ale zajęło mi to siedem rewizji, myślę, że dostanę go tam, gdzie jest. Następnym razem będzie łatwiej. Jeśli potrzebujesz pomocy, daj mi znać.<br/><br/>travmaj z australia dnia August 12, 2015:<br/><br/>Cześć John, na pewno miałeś kilka doskonałych odpowiedzi na swoje wyzwanie - jestem pewien, że pięknie go połączysz, chociaż wyobrażam sobie trudne zadanie. Interesują mnie również twoje książki poezji - naprawdę muszę się zebrać pod względem technologicznym - spróbuję to wszystko sprawdzić...<br/><br/>John Hansen (autor) z Gondwana Land w dniu 11 sierpnia 2015 r.:<br/><br/>Cześć Jo, obie książki "On the Wings of Eagles" i "I Laughed a Smile" mają w większości tę samą treść... z wyjątkiem pierwszego ma jeden dodatkowy wiersz. Początkowo były one w różnych formatach, jeden ePub, drugi PDF, ale teraz oba są ePub. Są one dostępne za pośrednictwem Lulu i iBooks, wkrótce Barnes i Noble i Nook (nie Amazon). Mogę spróbować opublikować kolejną książkę za pośrednictwem Amazona wkrótce, aby zobaczyć, jak się porównuje. Jeszcze raz dziękuję.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues z Lincolnshire, Wielka Brytania dnia 11 sierpnia 2015 r.:<br/><br/>John, dziękuję bardzo, informacje o publikowaniu z Lulu będą bardzo przydatne, ponieważ myślę o publikacji, ale obecnie jestem rozdarty między Amazon i Lulu. Chciałem kupić jedną z twoich książek, ale nie mogłem ich znaleźć na Amazon. Jednak pewnie dostanę to od Lulu. Życzę ci sukcesów, zasługujesz na to.<br/><br/>John Hansen (autor) z Gondwana Land w dniu 11 sierpnia 2015 r.:<br/><br/>Hej Phyllis, dzięki za podziękowanie. Podoba mi się, idealne zakończenie wiersza, jak myślę.<br/><br/>John Hansen (autor) z Gondwana Land w dniu 11 sierpnia 2015 r.:<br/><br/>Dzięki Faith.<br/><br/>John Hansen (autor) z Gondwana Land w dniu 11 sierpnia 2015 r.:<br/><br/>Cześć Jo, myślę, że zadowalająco uporządkowałem wiersz. Czekam, aby zobaczyć, czy jest coś więcej do dodania. Publikowanie z Lulu nie było złe, a teraz, gdy już to zrobiłem, następnym razem będzie łatwiej. Uzyskanie formatowania, aby wyglądać dobrze w eBooku, było najtrudniejsze, chociaż po prostu wpisz go w dokumencie słownym, a Lulu automatycznie tworzy stronę zawartości i konwertuje dokument do ePub lub PDF, możesz użyć tylko niektórych czcionek i upewnij się, że nazwy rozdziałów lub tytuły wierszy znajdują się w nagłówku 1. Zapewniają również bezpłatny numer ISBN, jeśli chcesz. Ogólnie rzecz biorąc było to łatwiejsze niż się spodziewano.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues z Lincolnshire, Wielka Brytania dnia 11 sierpnia 2015 r.:<br/><br/>Phyllis, to jest zwięzłe i piękne, uwielbiam to. Shyron też wykonała świetną robotę, myślałam, że już skomentowałam jej werset, ale nie zrobiłam tego.<br/><br/>Phyllis Doyle Burns z High Desert of Nevada. 10 sierpnia 2015:<br/><br/>Wspaniały hub, świetny pomysł, Jodah. Oto jeden ode mnie. Krótki, ale słodki.

Ja też czekam na końcowy wynik po tym, jak John zrobi swoją magię, aby to wszystko zebrać.<br/><br/>Podzielę się jeszcze raz, aby zobaczyć, czy jest więcej chętnych.<br/><br/>Błogosławieństwo<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues z Lincolnshire, Wielka Brytania w dniu 10 sierpnia 2015 r.:<br/><br/>Wiara, pięknie wykonana, uważam za niewiarygodne, jak ktoś z tak ograniczonym wzrokiem może nauczyć nas tak wiele o pięknie, świetle i cieniach. John, nie mogę się doczekać, aby przeczytać wynik końcowy.<br/><br/>Nawiasem mówiąc, kongtats na publikowaniu swoich wierszy. Jak znalazłeś proces publikowania z Lulu?<br/><br/>John Hansen (autor) z Gondwana Land, 10 sierpnia 2015:<br/><br/>Faith. Nie, jeszcze nie jest za późno, wciąż kompiluję ostatni wiersz, więc wszyscy powinni go zobaczyć za dzień lub dwa.<br/><br/>Faith Reaper z południa USA, 10 sierpnia 2015:<br/><br/>Cześć John,<br/><br/>Przepraszam za spóźnione zgłoszenie się tutaj do twojego wspaniałego wyzwania. Jestem poza pracą przez kilka dni i postanowiłam dać temu szansę, podczas gdy mój mąż odpoczywa od operacji kolana. Jeśli nie spełnia twoich standardów, nie używaj go w swoim ostatecznym wierszu lub edytuj według własnego uznania.<br/><br/>Błogosławieństwo zawsze<br/><br/>Oto jak to jest:<br/><br/>Wyznania do przyjaciela Georgesa Clemenceau<br/><br/>O świetle otaczającym obie męki, radość<br/><br/>Zagorzałe szaleństwo w analizie kolorów<br/><br/>Konsekwentne spontaniczne kreacje<br/><br/>Sezon po sezonie obsesji<br/><br/>Uchwycenie różnych odcieni w jednej chwili<br/><br/>Uprzejmy podczas spaceru w Argenteuill<br/><br/>Bary pędzelkowe arcydzieło.<br/><br/>John Hansen (autor) z Gondwana Land, 09 sierpnia 2015:<br/><br/>Wystarczy krzyknąć, aby zobaczyć, czy ktoś jeszcze chce wnieść wkład do tego wiersza łańcuchowego. Zacząłem kompilować strofy razem, ale pozostawię go otwartym na kilka dni na wypadek, gdyby ktoś inny chciał dołączyć. Dziękuję wszystkim, którzy przyczynili się.<br/><br/>John Hansen (autor) z Gondwana Land, 02 sierpnia 2015:<br/><br/>Dziękuję Genna. Wygląda na to, że Monet jest ulubioną arystką wielu tutaj. Mam nadzieję, że również weźmiesz udział w tym wyzwaniu :)<br/><br/>John Hansen (autor) z Gondwana Land, 02 sierpnia 2015:<br/><br/>Dziękuję za wspaniały wkład Shyron. To bardzo ładny werset. Dobra robota.<br/><br/>Genna East z Massachusetts, USA dnia 02 sierpnia 2015 r.:<br/><br/>Cześć John...<br/><br/>Zacząłem czytać to wspaniałe wyzwanie (Monet jest jednym z moich ulubionych artystów), a potem wróciłem, aby dokończyć czytanie niektórych pięknych wkładów, które nadają temu obrazowi oszałamiający głos poprzez percepcję i zmysły.

Po prostu dał poczekać i zobaczyć, czy są jeszcze.<br/><br/>Ocfireflies z Północnej Karoliny dnia 02 sierpnia 2015:<br/><br/>John,<br/><br/>Za każdym razem, gdy wracam, widzę kolejne ogniwo w tym poetyckim łańcuchu i Wow, czy Jo kiedykolwiek wymierza sprawiedliwość.<br/><br/>Kim<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues z Lincolnshire, Wielka Brytania dnia 02 sierpnia 2015 r.:<br/><br/>Cześć John, "sublimacja" zrobi ładnie. Cieszę się, że podoba ci się mój wkład. To bardzo dobry pomysł, wiem, że będziesz się dobrze bawić, kładąc to wszystko razem. Zaopiekuj się i moje najlepsze dla ciebie.<br/><br/>John Hansen (autor) z Gondwana Land, 01 sierpnia 2015:<br/><br/>Dzięki Deb, tak, jestem pod wrażeniem standardu zgłoszeń. Nie mogę się doczekać, aby umieścić to wszystko razem.<br/><br/>John Hansen (autor) z Gondwana Land, 01 sierpnia 2015:<br/><br/>Tak, Ann, dobrze jest widzieć, że poeci wśród nas podejmują wyzwanie z jakimś wielkim wkładem do tej pory. Mam nadzieję, że Imcan zrobi to sprawiedliwie, jeśli chodzi o łączenie go.<br/><br/>John Hansen (autor) z Gondwana Land, 01 sierpnia 2015:<br/><br/>Brawo Jo. Słowo "sublimacja" przychodzi na myśl. Miałem nadzieję, że wszyscy poeci wyjdą na pierwszy plan, i tak się stało. Uwielbiam to, dzięki za wkład.<br/><br/>Deb Hirt z Stillwater, OK, 01 sierpnia 2015:<br/><br/>Jestem podekscytowany, aby zobaczyć, co się tu kończy. Istnieje wiele wspaniałych poetów, którzy stawiają czoła wyzwaniu, więc idź do niego!<br/><br/>Ann Carr z SW England w dniu 01 sierpnia 2015 r.:<br/><br/>Świetnie, Jo!<br/><br/>Zamiast mnie, zbierzesz to wszystko razem, ale to będzie wiersz, kiedy w końcu się skończy - jeśli kiedykolwiek się skończy!<br/><br/>Ann<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues z Lincolnshire, UK dnia 01 sierpnia 2015 r.:<br/><br/>Dobrze, John tu nie idzie! Mam nadzieję, że dobrze czyta.<br/><br/>I chłopiec zaczął odchodzić<br/><br/>Ale w jego świetle usłyszałem, jak mówi<br/><br/>"Wybrałem się na wycieczkę do Orangerie<br/><br/>Gdzie duch Moneta wciąż trwa<br/><br/>Usiadłem i patrzyłem przez chwilę<br/><br/>Dopóki nie usłyszałem łagodnego krzyku.<br/><br/>Czy kiedykolwiek widziałeś płynny sen?<br/><br/>Gdzie światło przekształca się w to, czego dotyka<br/><br/>Gdzie spokój płynie przez pochmurną zasłonę<br/><br/>Gdzie pędzel czarodzieja jak błyskawica<br/><br/>Czy kiedykolwiek widziałeś wspaniały widok?<br/><br/>Dziecko urodzone ze zniekształconej iluzji<br/><br/>Ten kwitnący staw, który zatrzymuje światło<br/><br/>Które podnoszą serce i przyciągają duszę<br/><br/>Abstrakcyjna pulchritude z bliska<br/><br/>Odsuń się, oto taka spokojna rozkosz”.<br/><br/>Mam nadzieję, że jest to zgodne z tym, co zrobili inni. W razie potrzeby edytuj. Moje najlepsze...<br/><br/>- Jo.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues z Lincolnshire, UK dnia 01 sierpnia 2015 r.:<br/><br/>W porządku!<br/><br/>John Hansen (autor) z Gondwana Land, 01 sierpnia 2015:<br/><br/>Tak Jo, proszę zrobić. Każdy jest mile widziany, aby zrobić więcej niż jedną strofę. Mogę dodać inny sam na pewnym etapie.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues z Lincolnshire, UK dnia 01 sierpnia 2015 r.:<br/><br/>John, zdecydowałem się na przejście, ale jest to około 16 wierszy, czy mogę to zrobić w dwóch strofach następujących po wspaniałym zgłoszeniu Kim? Zawsze możesz go edytować później.<br/><br/>John Hansen (autor) z Gondwana Land w dniu 31 lipca 2015 r.:<br/><br/>Cześć Jo, przykro mi słyszeć, że jesteś w pogodzie w tej chwili. Nie jestem w pośpiechu, aby zamknąć to wyzwanie, więc będę go trzymać otwarte, dopóki nie wrócisz strzelając do wszystkich cylindrów i są w stanie przyczynić się. Jesteś jednym z hubbers czekałem na odpowiedź od jak myślałem, że będzie pasować. Dziękuję za uprzejme słowa, i wyzdrowieć wkrótce.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues z Lincolnshire, Wielka Brytania w dniu 31 lipca 2015 r.:<br/><br/>Wow! John Nie mogę uwierzyć, że prawie przegapiłem twoje niesamowite wyzwanie. To jest coś, w czym chciałbym uczestniczyć, ponieważ Claude Monet jest jednym z moich ulubionych artystów. Niestety, muszę płakać. Jestem trochę pod pogodą z głową pełną wełny bawełnianej, lub tak się wydaje. Jeśli wyzwanie jest nadal otwarte, gdy pozbędę się tej irytującej grypy, mogę spróbować, ale muszę powiedzieć, że standard jest wyjątkowo wysoki. Maj wziął to na inny poziom, ale wszystkie zgłoszenia są genialne. Życzę Wam Andriealphusa i innych pisarzy, którzy do tej pory uczestniczyli w tym arcydziele artystycznym i twórczym.<br/><br/>Najlepsza zawsze Jo.<br/><br/>John Hansen (autor) z Gondwana Land w dniu 31 lipca 2015 r.:<br/><br/>Witam ponownie Maj, cieszę się, że ten wiersz Cię zainspirował, i tak to bije oglądanie krykieta, zwłaszcza z Aussie Batsmen źle w tym trzecim teście. To będzie dla mnie ciekawe ćwiczenie, aby połączyć wszystkie strofy razem, ale powinno być dobre.<br/><br/>travmaj z australia dnia 30 lipca 2015:<br/><br/>John, dziękuję, cieszę się, że podoba ci się moja oferta. Uznałem, że wiersz jest intrygujący i nagle poczułem się zainspirowany do napisania mojej wersji w tym samym trybie. Nie jestem pewna, czy napisałam kontynuację ze strofy wcześniej (zawsze badając), ale jestem pewna, że całkowicie ją połączysz, gdy nadejdzie czas. Uwielbiam wszystkie odpowiedzi. Nie udało mi się twórczego pisania dla yonków, nie mogę się doczekać, aby zacząć od nowa, po prostu potrzebuję trochę czasu. (bije oglądanie krykieta też!!!) Cheers John, będzie sprawdzanie w -<br/><br/>John Hansen (autor) z Gondwana Land w dniu 30 lipca 2015 r.:<br/><br/>Dziękuję za sprawdzenie Dana. Jestem zadowolony z jakości odpowiedzi jak dotąd. Muszę poczekać i zobaczyć, ile jeszcze przyjdzie. Ostateczny, wiersz powinien być świetny.<br/><br/>Dana Tate z Los Angeles 30 lipca 2015:<br/><br/>Sprawdzam, jak idzie, nie mogę się doczekać gotowego produktu. Uczęszczałam na lekcje poezji i robiliśmy to też było naprawdę zabawne.<br/><br/>ocfireflies z Karoliny Północnej w dniu Lipiec 29, 2015:<br/><br/>John,<br/><br/>Dziękuję bardzo za dostarczenie platformy, bez której łatwo jest spaść.<br/><br/>;) Kim<br/><br/>John Hansen (autor) z Gondwana Land w dniu 29 lipca 2015 r.:<br/><br/>Dzięki, Devika. Nie widziałem cię od jakiegoś czasu, mam nadzieję, że wszystko w porządku.<br/><br/>John Hansen (autor) z Gondwana Land w dniu 29 lipca 2015 r.:<br/><br/>Piękna praca Kim.

Jestem bardzo zadowolony z jakości odpowiedzi jak dotąd.<br/><br/>ocfireflies z Karoliny Północnej w dniu Lipiec 29, 2015:<br/><br/>John,<br/><br/>Wysłałem to wcześniej przed niesamowitym wkładem travmaja, ale może nadal działa (robiłem trochę poprawek)<br/><br/>w przeciwieństwie do poprzedniego - nie wiem, czy<br/><br/>Mam jakiś sens.

| First of all EEQT itself needs to be further developed in order to provide a theoretical and computational answer to the needs of modern quantum engineering<br/>and technology. We need to include classical systems with infinite<br/>numbers of degrees of freedom - like electromagnetic and/or gravitational<br/>field. We also need to include infinite quantum systems so as<br/>to understand and simulate Bose gas and its phase transitions. But, there<br/>are also steps that must be taken far beyond the paradigm of EEQT.<br/>As we have emphasized so many times: quantum theory has yet<br/>to be understood in terms of a "non-linear classical theory." But what we mean by a "classical theory" is something much more advanced and more<br/>general than clasical mechanics or classical field theory. By a "classical theory" we mean first of all, a theory that is not based<br/>on probabilities from the start; a theory in which probabilities appear at a<br/>later stage, derived from the theory; derived perhaps, in a necessary way. Such a theory must not only specify the mathematical objects and their relations but also make "predictions".<br/>A classical theory is, in particular, a theory in which discrete events can happen, events that are "objective." They may be events that affect mainly the physical stratum, but they may be also "mental<br/>events," changes of states of "consciousness;" whatever they are, even if they<br/>are concerned with branchings of universes, - they DO HAPPEN.<br/>Such a theory, encompassing the quantum theory as we know it today,<br/>does not yet exist, but we can envisage its possible shape. Nothing serves better than an example, so let us give here an example of how<br/>such a theory can be construed.<br/>Imagine a theory developed a'la Einstein's unified field theory, but<br/>with variable metric signature, possibly with a complex causal web, multiple<br/>Einstein-Rosen [40] (see also [41]) bridges,<br/>time loops, nondifferrentiability, fractal structure, all of that additionally complicated by variable dimensionality of space and of "time" (cf [42]. Imagine such a theory to be able to accomodate all the four fundamental<br/>forces known to us, but it also involves an extra field, which is different<br/>from physical fields, and which is non-local in the sense that it does not<br/>survive taking a macro-average-limit when causal space-time<br/>structure of Einstein's general relativity is recovered. This extra field<br/>would be a place for "thought forms" and our theory would couple these<br/>thought forms to more "physical" levels of reality. The very concept of<br/>"time" would arise only in one particular limiting structure. Nothing<br/>prevents a theory of such a type to have mathematical structures rich enough to accomodate consciousness and mind. Due to its complexity,<br/>density of time-loops, bubble-like causal structure, making predictions<br/>in such theory is possible only by applying probability -<br/>as it is the case with systems evolving according to deterministic<br/>but chaotic dynamics. Quantum wave function would emerge in such a<br/>theory as an effective way of predicting. That type of explanation<br/>of quantum indeterminism was postulated long ago by I. J. Good. In<br/>[3] he speculated that<br/>quantum indeterminism can be understood if we admit that individual quantum events that actually happen here and now have future<br/>advanced causes as well has past retarded causes.<br/>A glimpse of such a thought<br/>may have occured to Alan Turing when he wrote his famous, already quoted sentence: "prediction must be linear, description must be nonlinear."<br/>A theory going partially in this direction is being developed by L. Nottale<br/>[43] who states the observation, attributed to Feynman, that "the typical paths of quantum mechanical particles are continuous non-differentiable." Then he continues his development of fractal<br/>space-time ideas to conclude with: "The quantum behavior becomes, in this theory,<br/>a manifestation of the fractal geometry of space-time, in the same way gravitation is, in Einstein's theory of general (motion-)relativity, a manifestation of the curvature of space-time.<br/>Another step in this direction comes from the work of Russian scientists - which started with the most original ideas of N.A. Kozyrev [44]<br/>and A. Sakharov [45], and is being developed in Moscow, the Urals and Siberia, see e.g. [46, 47, 48]. | Przede wszystkim sam EEQT należy dalej rozwijać, aby zapewnić teoretyczną i obliczeniową odpowiedź na potrzeby nowoczesnej inżynierii kwantowej i technologii. Musimy uwzględnić klasyczne systemy o nieskończonej liczbie stopni swobody - takie jak pole elektromagnetyczne i / lub grawitacyjne. Musimy również uwzględnić nieskończone systemy kwantowe, aby zrozumieć i symulować gaz Bose i jego przejścia fazowe. Ale są też kroki, które muszą być podjęte daleko poza paradygmatem EEQT.<br/>Jak wielokrotnie podkreślaliśmy, teoria kwantowa nie została jeszcze zrozumiana w kategoriach „nieliniowej teorii klasycznej”. Ale to, co rozumiemy przez "teorię klasyczną", jest czymś znacznie bardziej zaawansowanym i bardziej ogólnym niż klasyczna mechanika lub klasyczna teoria pola. Przez „teorię klasyczną” mamy na myśli przede wszystkim teorię, która nie opiera się na prawdopodobieństwach od samego początku; teorię, w której prawdopodobieństwa pojawiają się na późniejszym etapie, wywodzącą się z teorii; wywodzącą się być może w niezbędny sposób. Taka teoria musi nie tylko określać obiekty matematyczne i ich relacje, ale także robić "przewidywania".<br/>Klasyczna teoria jest w szczególności teorią, w której mogą zdarzyć się zdarzenia dyskretne, zdarzenia, które są "obiektywne". Mogą to być zdarzenia, które wpływają głównie na warstwę fizyczną, ale mogą to być również „wydarzenia umysłowe”, zmiany stanów „świadomości”; czymkolwiek one są, nawet jeśli dotyczą rozgałęzień wszechświatów, - one DZIAŁAJĄ.<br/>Taka teoria, obejmująca teorię kwantową, jaką znamy dzisiaj, nie istnieje jeszcze, ale możemy sobie wyobrazić jej możliwy kształt. Nic nie służy lepiej niż przykład, więc podajmy tutaj przykład, jak można taką teorię zinterpretować.<br/>Wyobraź sobie, że teoria opracowała ujednoliconą teorię pola Einsteina, ale ze zmienną sygnaturą metryczną, prawdopodobnie ze złożoną siecią przyczynową, wielokrotną.<br/>Einstein-Rosen [40] (zob. także [41]) mosty, pętle czasowe, niezróżnicowanie, struktura fraktalna, wszystko to dodatkowo skomplikowane przez zmienną wymiarowość przestrzeni i "czasu" (por. [42]. Wyobraź sobie, że taka teoria jest w stanie przystosować się do wszystkich czterech znanych nam sił fundamentalnych, ale obejmuje również dodatkowe pole, które różni się od pól fizycznych i które nie jest lokalne w tym sensie, że nie przeżywa przyjmowania makro-średniej granicy, gdy odzyskuje się przyczynową strukturę przestrzeni i czasu ogólnej teorii względności Einsteina. To dodatkowe pole byłoby miejscem dla "form myślowych", a nasza teoria połączyłaby te formy myślowe z bardziej "fizycznymi" poziomami rzeczywistości.<br/>Nic nie stoi na przeszkodzie, aby teoria takiego typu miała struktury matematyczne wystarczająco bogate, aby przystosować świadomość i umysł. Ze względu na swoją złożoność, gęstość pętli czasowych, strukturę przyczynową podobną do bańki, przewidywania w takiej teorii są możliwe tylko poprzez zastosowanie prawdopodobieństwa -<br/>Podobnie jak w przypadku układów ewoluujących zgodnie z deterministyczną, ale chaotyczną dynamiką, funkcja fali kwantowej pojawiłaby się w takiej teorii jako skuteczny sposób przewidywania. Tego rodzaju wyjaśnienie kwantowego indeterminizmu zostało dawno temu zasugerowane przez I. J. Gooda.<br/>[3] Spekulował, że kwantowy nieokreśloność może być zrozumiany, jeśli przyznamy, że poszczególne zdarzenia kwantowe, które faktycznie wydarzają się tutaj i teraz mają przyszłe przyczyny zaawansowane, mają również przeszłe przyczyny opóźnione.<br/>Alan Turing napisał swoje słynne, już cytowane zdanie: „Przewidywanie musi być liniowe, opis musi być nieliniowy”.<br/>Teoria idąca częściowo w tym kierunku jest rozwijana przez L. Nottale.<br/>[43] który stwierdza obserwację, przypisywaną Feynmanowi, że „typowe ścieżki cząstek mechanicznych kwantowych są ciągłe niezróżnicowane”. Następnie kontynuuje swój rozwój idei fraktalnych przestrzeni i czasu, aby zakończyć: „Zachowanie kwantowe staje się, w tej teorii, manifestacją geometrii fraktalnej przestrzeni i czasu, podobnie jak grawitacja jest, w teorii Einsteina ogólnej (motion-)relativity, manifestacją krzywizny przestrzeni i czasu.<br/>Kolejny krok w tym kierunku pochodzi z pracy rosyjskich naukowców - która rozpoczęła się od najbardziej oryginalnych pomysłów N.A. Kozyreva [44]<br/>i A. Sacharowa [45], a rozwija się w Moskwie, na Uralu i na Syberii, patrz np. [46, 47, 48]. |
| Best Nutrition And Exercise For Lose Weight<br/><br/>How is breakfast really healthy?<br/><br/>In the morning like an emperor, at noon like a king, in the evening like a beggar – goes a well-known proverb. A study by the medical organization Endocrine Society confirms the key message behind the saying: It shows that breakfast plays a more important role than is often assumed. In the morning, the human body actually has more than twice as high a metabolic activity as at other times of the day: A large breakfast not only keeps you full for a long time, blood sugar and insulin levels also rise slowly. The appetite for sweets is regulated, we eat snacks less often during the day. Therefore, breakfast should not be skipped even during a diet.<br/><br/>Of course, having a big breakfast doesn't mean that we should have several croissants with nut nougat cream and sweet breakfast pancakes in the morning. Breakfast is healthy best when it is high in protein and fiber, as well as providing vitamins and minerals. Whole grain bread or muesli, oat flakes, fruits and nuts are energy suppliers that are good for you and keep you full for a long time.<br/><br/>The fact that a large breakfast is better than a large dinner does not necessarily mean that breakfast is essential for losing weight. A meta-analysis carried out in 2019 showed, that the total daily energy intake of people who eat breakfast is on average higher, than that of those who do not have breakfast. The latter were on average just under half a kilo lighter. So, according to the results of this major study, you don't necessarily have to eat breakfast if you want to lose weight.<br/><br/>Lose weight with the right diet – that's how easy it is to put healthy on your plate<br/><br/>Eating healthy in no way means less taste. Fresh vegetables, fish or meat as protein sources and other healthy ingredients conjure up taste in the pot and a smile on your lips – ideally also when you step on the scales. A US study has shown that people who cook their own food and consciously deal with what they eat have a body mass index in the normal range. Restaurant visits or fast food, on the other hand, quickly lure you into the sugar trap: Often there is no indication of how much sugar is in salad dressings, how much fat the potatoes were fried in or whether the meat was not treated.<br/><br/>A healthy lunch consists of three parts – the largest part is fruits or vegetables and should cover half of the plate. A quarter of the meal should consist of protein, i.e. fish, meat or tofu. The remaining quarter consists of carbohydrates and is ideally made from whole grain products. Important: Don't eat at your desk in the office, but stimulate your metabolism and ideally take a short walk before or after lunch.<br/><br/>When should you eat to lose weight?<br/><br/>In the evening, you should focus on light meals that are rather low in carbohydrates. These are the least likely to cause insulin to skyrocket, which is good for our body. Vegetables, dairy products and nuts, for example, are well suited for this.<br/><br/>You should also be careful not to have dinner too late. It is best to have eaten until 7 p.m. – then the body can relax and prepare for the night. Sufficient sleep is important for healthy weight loss. A US study found that people who slept about eight hours a night had better fat deposits. So good night! Allow yourself more than six hours of sleep so that you can start the next day fit and refreshed.<br/><br/>Losing weight without exercise – is it really possible?<br/><br/>It would be so easy, if the dream weight could be achieved simply by lowering the calorie intake. But you probably know the wisdom that diet is only one side of the coin and exercise is the other. So nothing helps: Put on your sportswear and off you go!<br/><br/>Anyone who, in addition to the sports program such as jogging, walking or swimming, also lets the elevator go alone and takes the stairs, takes a little detour or uses the bike instead of the car, is doing wellis also called something good. Even simple walking is good for health. | Najlepsze odżywianie i ćwiczenia dla utraty wagi<br/><br/>W jaki sposób śniadanie jest naprawdę zdrowe?<br/><br/>Rano jak cesarz, w południe jak król, wieczorem jak żebrak – mówi znane przysłowie. Badanie przeprowadzone przez organizację medyczną Endocrine Society potwierdza kluczowe przesłanie stojące za powiedzeniem: pokazuje, że śniadanie odgrywa ważniejszą rolę niż często się zakłada. Rano organizm ludzki ma ponad dwukrotnie większą aktywność metaboliczną niż w innych porach dnia: duże śniadanie nie tylko utrzymuje cię przez długi czas, ale poziom cukru we krwi i insuliny również powoli wzrasta. Apetyt na słodycze jest regulowany, jemy przekąski rzadziej w ciągu dnia. Dlatego śniadanie nie powinno być pomijane nawet podczas diety.<br/><br/>Oczywiście, duże śniadanie nie oznacza, że powinniśmy mieć kilka rogalików z kremem nugat orzechowy i słodkie naleśniki śniadaniowe w godzinach porannych. Śniadanie jest zdrowe najlepiej, gdy jest bogate w białko i błonnik, a także dostarcza witamin i minerałów. Chleb pełnoziarnisty lub müsli, płatki owsiane, owoce i orzechy są dostawcami energii, które są dobre dla Ciebie i utrzymują Cię przez długi czas.<br/><br/>Fakt, że duże śniadanie jest lepsze niż duży obiad, niekoniecznie oznacza, że śniadanie jest niezbędne do utraty wagi. Przeprowadzona w 2019 roku metaanaliza wykazała, że całkowite dzienne spożycie energii u osób, które jedzą śniadanie, jest średnio wyższe niż u osób, które nie jedzą śniadania. Te ostatnie były średnio o niecałe pół kilograma lżejsze. Tak więc, zgodnie z wynikami tego głównego badania, niekoniecznie musisz jeść śniadanie, jeśli chcesz schudnąć.<br/><br/>Utrata wagi z właściwej diety – to, jak łatwo jest umieścić zdrowe na talerzu<br/><br/>Zdrowe odżywianie w żaden sposób nie oznacza mniejszego smaku. Świeże warzywa, ryby czy mięso jako źródła białka i inne zdrowe składniki wyczarują smak w garnku i uśmiech na ustach – idealnie również wtedy, gdy nadepniesz na wagę. Amerykańskie badanie wykazało, że ludzie, którzy gotują własne jedzenie i świadomie zajmują się tym, co jedzą, mają wskaźnik masy ciała w normalnym zakresie. Z drugiej strony wizyty w restauracji lub fast food szybko zwabiają Cię w pułapkę na cukier: Często nie ma wskazówek, ile cukru znajduje się w dressingach sałatkowych, ile tłuszczu smażyło ziemniaki lub czy mięso nie zostało poddane obróbce.<br/><br/>Zdrowy obiad składa się z trzech części – największa część to owoce lub warzywa i powinna obejmować połowę talerza. Jedna czwarta posiłku powinna składać się z białka, tj. ryb, mięsa lub tofu. Pozostała ćwiartka składa się z węglowodanów i jest idealnie wykonana z produktów pełnoziarnistych. Ważne: Nie jedz przy biurku w biurze, ale stymuluj metabolizm i idealnie zrób krótki spacer przed lub po obiedzie.<br/><br/>Kiedy jeść, aby schudnąć?<br/><br/>Wieczorem powinieneś skupić się na lekkich posiłkach, które mają dość niską zawartość węglowodanów. Są to najmniej prawdopodobne, aby spowodować gwałtowny wzrost insuliny, co jest dobre dla naszego organizmu. Do tego dobrze nadają się warzywa, produkty mleczne i orzechy.<br/><br/>Należy również uważać, aby nie zjeść kolacji za późno. Najlepiej zjeść do godziny 19:00 – wtedy organizm może się zrelaksować i przygotować na noc. Dostateczna ilość snu jest ważna dla zdrowej utraty wagi. Amerykańskie badanie wykazało, że ludzie, którzy spali około ośmiu godzin w nocy, mieli lepsze odkłady tłuszczu. Więc dobranoc! Pozwól sobie na więcej niż sześć godzin snu, abyś mógł rozpocząć następny dzień fit i odświeżony.<br/><br/>Utrata wagi bez ćwiczeń – czy to możliwe?<br/><br/>Byłoby tak łatwo, jeśli waga marzeń można osiągnąć po prostu poprzez obniżenie spożycia kalorii. Ale prawdopodobnie znasz mądrość, że dieta to tylko jedna strona monety, a ćwiczenia to druga. Więc nic nie pomaga: Załóż odzież sportową i wyjdź!<br/><br/>Każdy, kto oprócz programu sportowego, takiego jak jogging, spacery lub pływanie, pozwala również windzie iść samemu i podejmuje schody, robi małą objazd lub korzysta z roweru zamiast samochodu, robi wellis również nazywany czymś dobrym. Nawet prosty spacer jest dobry dla zdrowia. |
| Why We Open Sourced the Anvil App Server<br/><br/>Why Open Source?<br/><br/>A little while ago, we open-sourced the Anvil App Server. The community reaction has been great, even a little overwhelming (yes, every reply to that announcement really did land in my inbox!). We've already incorporated a bunch of that feedback into our version 1.2 release. But we keep getting asked, " Why did you open-source such a core part of your product? "<br/><br/>Why do this at all?<br/><br/>Anvil is a tool that makes it as simple as possible to build a web app. We do that by enabling you to build the whole application in one language, Python.<br/><br/>Simple hosting is part of that.<br/><br/>The web platform is broken , and Anvil is our attempt to fix it. And, because there is so much complexity in deploying a web app, a cloud-hosted service was the best way to provide the simplicity we want. That way, you can build your app in the Anvil Editor, and make it live on the Internet with one click.<br/><br/>But we kept hearing from people who said, "that's great, but…"<br/><br/>"…but I need to run this on an offshore platform without reliable internet access"<br/><br/>"…but I want to package my app into an IoT device I sell"<br/><br/>or simply, "…but if I'm putting my eggs in this basket, how can I be sure I can still run my app in ten years' time?"<br/><br/>These are all good points! A cloud service isn't the right solution for everyone. If we want to serve these users, there's got to be some way for them to get their apps out of Anvil and run them locally, under their own complete control.<br/><br/>Open Source: Escape hatch, not an ejector seat<br/><br/>We believe in escape hatches, not ejector seats. At conferences, we sometimes get asked, "can I export this as a Flask+JS app?". Sure, it would be possible – we could generate a server package, compile the client-side Python to Javascript, and spit out a classic web app. But it would have serious drawbacks, because:<br/><br/>Not a comfy ride.<br/><br/>Code generation is an ejector seat. Generated code is better than nothing – at least you can edit it! But the moment you edit that code, you lose all the benefits of the system that generated it. If you're using Anvil because of its drag-and-drop editor and Python in the browser, why should our locally-hosted users have to use vim and Javascript?<br/><br/>So we did it the right way: we open-sourced Anvil's runtime engine. It's the same code that serves your app in our hosted service, and it represents your app the same way. You can edit your code with a text editor, run it, then git push it back into our online IDE. It's not an ejector seat: there's no explosive transition. It's an escape hatch: you can climb out, and climb right back in.<br/><br/>What about our business model?<br/><br/>Anvil was never meant to be one of those enterprise low-code systems that charge you $20/mo for each person who uses your app. Anvil is a developer tool. The apps you develop are yours. Enabling you to run them on a Raspberry Pi is cool, but it doesn't change our business model.<br/><br/>We're doing what we always were: We make and sell a development tool that makes it drastically simpler to build web applications. We provide hosting for Anvil apps. We offer the entire development-and-hosting platform on-site for enterprise customers. And, of course, we offer a free plan so that everyone can use Anvil for hobby or educational purposes – or to start building something and see how it goes.<br/><br/>We've open-sourced the Anvil App Server for the (relatively small) number of people who need it, and to provide the ultimate insurance policy. Sure, you can build an app with vim and host it yourself, without even registering an account with us (we've got docs to show you how!). But the Anvil Editor is the world's easiest way to build a web app, and our hosted service is the easiest way to deploy it – so that's what we expect most of our users to continue doing. And you can build with confidence, knowing that the open-source code is right there if you need it.<br/><br/>Try it yourself<br/><br/>If our development philosophy resonates with you, why not try Anvil yourself? | Dlaczego otworzyliśmy serwer aplikacji Anvil<br/><br/>Dlaczego Open Source?<br/><br/>Niedawno uruchomiliśmy open-source serwer aplikacji Anvil. Reakcja społeczności była świetna, nawet trochę przytłaczająca (tak, każda odpowiedź na to ogłoszenie naprawdę wylądowała w mojej skrzynce odbiorczej!). Wprowadziliśmy już wiele takich informacji zwrotnych do naszej wersji 1.2. Ale ciągle nas pytają: "Dlaczego otworzyłeś taką podstawową część swojego produktu?"<br/><br/>Dlaczego w ogóle to robisz?<br/><br/>Anvil to narzędzie, które sprawia, że budowa aplikacji internetowej jest tak prosta, jak to tylko możliwe. Robimy to, umożliwiając Ci zbudowanie całej aplikacji w jednym języku, Python.<br/><br/>Prosty hosting jest częścią tego.<br/><br/>Platforma internetowa jest zepsuta, a Anvil jest naszą próbą jej naprawienia. A ponieważ jest tak wiele złożoności w wdrażaniu aplikacji internetowej, usługa hostowana w chmurze była najlepszym sposobem na zapewnienie prostoty, której chcemy. W ten sposób możesz zbudować swoją aplikację w Edytorze Anvil i sprawić, że będzie ona żyła w Internecie za pomocą jednego kliknięcia.<br/><br/>Ale ciągle słyszeliśmy od ludzi, którzy mówili: "To wspaniale, ale..."<br/><br/>"...ale muszę to uruchomić na platformie offshore bez niezawodnego dostępu do Internetu"<br/><br/>"...ale chcę zapakować moją aplikację w urządzenie IoT, które sprzedaję"<br/><br/>lub po prostu: "...ale jeśli wkładam swoje jaja do tego koszyka, skąd mogę mieć pewność, że będę mógł uruchomić moją aplikację za dziesięć lat?"<br/><br/>Wszystkie te punkty są dobre! Usługa w chmurze nie jest właściwym rozwiązaniem dla każdego. Jeśli chcemy służyć tym użytkownikom, musi być jakiś sposób, aby wyciągnąć swoje aplikacje z Anvil i uruchomić je lokalnie, pod ich pełną kontrolą.<br/><br/>Otwarty kod źródłowy: Escape hatch, nie siedzisko wyrzutnika<br/><br/>Wierzymy w włazy ewakuacyjne, a nie siedzenia wyrzutników. Na konferencjach czasami pytają nas: "Czy mogę wyeksportować to jako aplikację Flask + JS?". Oczywiście, byłoby to możliwe – moglibyśmy wygenerować pakiet serwera, skompilować po stronie klienta Python do Javascriptu i wypluć klasyczną aplikację internetową. Ale miałoby to poważne wady, ponieważ:<br/><br/>Nie wygodna jazda.<br/><br/>Generowanie kodu jest miejscem wyrzutnika. Wygenerowany kod jest lepszy niż nic – przynajmniej możesz go edytować! Ale w momencie edycji tego kodu tracisz wszystkie zalety systemu, który go wygenerował. Jeśli używasz Anvil ze względu na edytor przeciągnij i upuść i Python w przeglądarce, dlaczego nasi lokalni użytkownicy powinni używać vim i Javascript?<br/><br/>Więc zrobiliśmy to we właściwy sposób: uruchomiliśmy silnik uruchomieniowy Anvil open source. Jest to ten sam kod, który służy Twojej aplikacji w naszej usłudze hostowanej i reprezentuje Twoją aplikację w ten sam sposób. Możesz edytować kod za pomocą edytora tekstowego, uruchomić go, a następnie wcisnąć go z powrotem do naszego internetowego IDE. To nie jest fotel wyrzutnika: nie ma wybuchowego przejścia. To jest właz ucieczkowy: możesz wyskoczyć i wspiąć się z powrotem.<br/><br/>A co z naszym modelem biznesowym?<br/><br/>Anvil nigdy nie miał być jednym z tych korporacyjnych systemów o niskim kodzie, które pobierają 20 USD / miesięcznie za każdą osobę, która korzysta z twojej aplikacji. Anvil jest narzędziem dla programistów. Aplikacje, które tworzysz, są twoje. Umożliwienie Ci uruchamiania ich na Raspberry Pi jest fajne, ale nie zmienia naszego modelu biznesowego.<br/><br/>Robimy to, co zawsze robiliśmy: tworzymy i sprzedajemy narzędzie programistyczne, które znacznie ułatwia tworzenie aplikacji internetowych. Zapewniamy hosting aplikacji Anvil. Oferujemy całą platformę programistyczną i hostingową na miejscu dla klientów korporacyjnych. I oczywiście oferujemy darmowy plan, dzięki któremu każdy może korzystać z Anvil do celów hobby lub edukacyjnych – lub zacząć budować coś i zobaczyć, jak to idzie.<br/><br/>Mamy open-source Anvil App Server dla (względnie niewielką) liczbę osób, które go potrzebują, i zapewnić ostateczną polisę ubezpieczeniową. Oczywiście, możesz zbudować aplikację z vim i hostować ją samodzielnie, nawet nie rejestrując u nas konta (mamy dokumenty, które pokażą Ci, jak!). Ale Anvil Editor jest najprostszym sposobem na zbudowanie aplikacji internetowej na świecie, a nasza usługa hostowana jest najprostszym sposobem jej wdrożenia - więc oczekujemy, że większość naszych użytkowników będzie nadal to robić. I możesz budować z ufnością, wiedząc, że kod open source jest tam, jeśli go potrzebujesz.<br/><br/>Wypróbuj sam<br/><br/>Jeśli nasza filozofia rozwoju rezonuje z tobą, dlaczego nie spróbować Anvil siebie? |
