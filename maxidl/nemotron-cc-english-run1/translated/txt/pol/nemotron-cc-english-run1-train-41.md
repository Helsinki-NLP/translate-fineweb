| Bacopa<br/><br/>19 Nov 2015<br/>Posted by Doxiderol<br/><br/>Bacopa is a perennial plant that thrives in marshy subtropical and tropical regions around the globe. The highly regarded herb is a key ingredient in Doxiderol, a nutritional supplement that enhances cognitive function. Bacopa was chosen for its ability to protect the brain and increase acetylcholine, a biochemical messenger that enables the nervous system to relay information.<br/><br/>Ayurvedic practitioners first described the therapeutic properties of bacopa in 300 BC. The physicians recorded bacopa's abilities to enhance intelligence and memory. Nearly 2,500 years later, a growing body of modern research confirms the cognitive benefits of bacopa recorded in the Ayurvedic text.<br/><br/>In 1987, researchers in India evaluated the effects of bacopa on the intellectual function of school-aged children. During the four-week study, they administered bacopa to 40 children who were 6 to 8 years old. The scientists determined that bacopa increased perception and memory. The children were able to solve maze exercises quicker and more accurately after receiving bacopa. Many parents in India routinely use bacopa to enhance their children's intellectual development.<br/><br/>A 12-week study published in the August 2001 issue of Psychopharmacology investigated the effects of bacopa on cognitive function. Scientists randomly assigned the healthy volunteers, aged 18 to 65, to receive bacopa or an inactive substance. They also used a double-blind configuration for the study to conceal the identities of the products. Researchers use this design to ensure that the test results are valid because it eliminates bias by the researchers and participants. The bacopa group experienced a significant improvement in the speed at which they were able to process visual information. The participants also learned faster and stored new memories more efficiently.<br/><br/>In 2007, a Texas A&M College of Medicine laboratory study revealed one of the mechanisms responsible for bacopa's ability to promote brain health. According to the scientists, bacopa uses polyphenols to prevent oxidative stress and the damage that it causes to healthy brain cells. Bacopa also reduces harmful deposits of a substance known as beta-amyloid, which is the primary component of the plaque in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease.<br/><br/>A double-blind study published in the July 2008 issue of the Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine evaluated the effect of bacopa on elderly patients. The study confirmed that bacopa increased cognitive performance while reducing stress. According to the authors, the benefits achieved in this study confirmed the results of earlier research.<br/><br/>A 90-day study published in the December 2008 issue of Phytotherapy Research confirms the cognitive benefits that were previously demonstrated in other bacopa studies. Bacopa significantly improved the ability of the participants to temporarily store and use information required for completing a complex task. The double-blind study also demonstrated that bacopa reduced the time required to process visual information.<br/><br/>In addition to enhancing nerve signal transmission, the scientists theorize that bacopa increases cognitive function by reducing anxiety. Numerous studies indicate that anxiety interferes with the ability to perform tasks that require higher-level cognitive functions, such as learning and memorization. Stress disrupts biochemical messengers and healthy nerve signal transmission. Bacopa alleviates stress and restores a sense of calm by increasing acetylcholine levels, which reduces your heart rate and enables you to take deeper breaths.<br/><br/>Doxiderol is a great way to obtain the benefits of bacopa. This holistic supplement also contains other natural ingredients that promote brain health and support your ability to focus and concentrate on complex task as well as memorize information. | Bacopa<br/><br/>19 lis 2015<br/>Opublikowano przez Doxiderol<br/><br/>Bacopa to wieloletnia roślina, która kwitnie w bagnistych subtropikalnych i tropikalnych regionach na całym świecie. Wysoce cenione zioło jest kluczowym składnikiem Doxiderolu, suplementu diety, który poprawia funkcje poznawcze. Bacopa została wybrana ze względu na jej zdolność do ochrony mózgu i zwiększenia acetylocholiny, biochemicznego posłańca, który umożliwia układowi nerwowemu przekazywanie informacji.<br/><br/>Praktycy Ajurwedy po raz pierwszy opisali właściwości terapeutyczne bakopy w 300 roku p.n.e. Lekarze zarejestrowali zdolności bakopy do poprawy inteligencji i pamięci. Prawie 2500 lat później, rosnąca liczba współczesnych badań potwierdza korzyści poznawcze Bacopa odnotowane w tekście ajurwedyjskim.<br/><br/>W 1987 roku naukowcy z Indii ocenili wpływ bacopy na funkcje intelektualne dzieci w wieku szkolnym. W trakcie czterotygodniowego badania podali bacopę 40 dzieciom w wieku od 6 do 8 lat. Naukowcy ustalili, że bacopa zwiększa percepcję i pamięć. Dzieci były w stanie szybciej i dokładniej rozwiązać ćwiczenia labiryntu po otrzymaniu bacopy. Wielu rodziców w Indiach rutynowo używa bacopy, aby poprawić rozwój intelektualny swoich dzieci.<br/><br/>12-tygodniowe badanie opublikowane w sierpniowym numerze Psychopharmacology z 2001 roku badało wpływ bacopy na funkcje poznawcze. Naukowcy losowo przydzielili zdrowym ochotnikom w wieku od 18 do 65 lat, aby otrzymywali bacopę lub substancję nieaktywną. Użyli również konfiguracji podwójnej ślepej próby do badania, aby ukryć tożsamości produktów. Naukowcy używają tego projektu, aby zapewnić, że wyniki testów są ważne, ponieważ eliminuje stronniczość przez badaczy i uczestników. Grupa Bacopa doświadczyła znacznej poprawy szybkości, z jaką była w stanie przetwarzać informacje wizualne. Uczestnicy uczyli się również szybciej i przechowywali nowe wspomnienia bardziej wydajnie.<br/><br/>W 2007 roku badanie laboratoryjne Texas A & M College of Medicine ujawniło jeden z mechanizmów odpowiedzialnych za zdolność bakopy do promowania zdrowia mózgu. Bacopa wykorzystuje polifenole, aby zapobiec stresowi oksydacyjnemu i uszkodzeniom, które powoduje zdrowe komórki mózgowe. Bacopa zmniejsza również szkodliwe osady substancji zwanej beta-amyloidem, która jest głównym składnikiem płytki nazębnej w mózgu pacjentów z chorobą Alzheimera.<br/><br/>W podwójnie zaślepionym badaniu opublikowanym w lipcu 2008 roku w czasopiśmie Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine oceniono wpływ bacopy na pacjentów w podeszłym wieku. Badanie potwierdziło, że bacopa zwiększa wydajność poznawczą przy jednoczesnym zmniejszeniu stresu. Według autorów korzyści osiągnięte w tym badaniu potwierdziły wyniki wcześniejszych badań.<br/><br/>90-dniowe badanie opublikowane w grudniu 2008 roku w wydaniu Phytotherapy Research potwierdza korzyści poznawcze, które zostały wcześniej wykazane w innych badaniach Bacopa. Bacopa znacznie poprawiła zdolność uczestników do tymczasowego przechowywania i wykorzystywania informacji wymaganych do wykonania skomplikowanego zadania. Badanie podwójnie ślepej próby wykazało również, że Bacopa skraca czas potrzebny do przetwarzania informacji wizualnych.<br/><br/>Oprócz wzmocnienia transmisji sygnału nerwowego, naukowcy teoretyzują, że bacopa zwiększa funkcje poznawcze poprzez zmniejszenie lęku. Liczne badania wskazują, że lęk zakłóca zdolność do wykonywania zadań, które wymagają funkcji poznawczych na wyższym poziomie, takich jak uczenie się i zapamiętywanie. Stres zakłóca biochemiczne posłańców i zdrowy przekaz sygnału nerwowego. Bacopa łagodzi stres i przywraca poczucie spokoju poprzez zwiększenie poziomu acetylocholiny, co zmniejsza tętno i pozwala na głębsze oddechy.<br/><br/>Doxiderol to świetny sposób na uzyskanie korzyści z Bacopa. Ten holistyczny suplement zawiera również inne naturalne składniki, które promują zdrowie mózgu i wspierają zdolność koncentracji i koncentracji na złożonym zadaniu, a także zapamiętują informacje. |

She can also sense demonic auras as well as evil auras. When she was born and growing, however, her powers were sealed and she was much less powerful. Since the defeat of the one sealing her powers, Kagome has reached her full potential.<br/><br/>PURIFICATION By making a physical connection, Kagome has the ability to purify both poison and darkness from a subject (living and inanimate). To do so, she projects her spiritual powers through her hand.<br/><br/>SPIRITUAL BARRIERS With her full potential, Kagome has the ability to create a barrier around herself and expand it around others. It is a dome-shaped barrier that can destroy weak demons that make contact with the barrier.<br/><br/>IMPROVED EYESIGHT<br/>Kagome has the ability to see things that are often invisible to the human eye: ghosts, spirits, divine and evil auras.<br/><br/>ABILITIES WITH WEAPONS<br/>Kagome has the ability to use a bow and arrow. She has been self trained, and after years of practice, her arrow rarely misses its mark. Alongside this, Kagome has the ability to infuse her arrows with powers. She can infuse an arrows with her spiritual powers which allows them to penetrate demonic forces, destroy spells, and purify objects. She can infuse her bow with her powers and deflect enemy attacks. She has the ability to infuse her arrows with purifying energy to purify poison as well as powerful, long distant demonic attacks. And, finally, she has the ability to bypass others with her arrow: If her target happens to be behind a barrier or a hostage, the arrow can teleport and hit only her target<br/><br/>The rest of her abilities have become rather unimportant as they are related to time travel (through the Bone Eater's Well), the Shikon Jewel, or her previous incarnation.<br/><br/>the canon<br/><br/>Kagome has been pulled a few days after her high school graduation, however, before the Bone Eater's Well has opened again to allow her to return to the past permanently.<br/><br/>freestyle<br/><br/>memories<br/><br/>かごめ<br/><br/>The sound of her name was a soft whisper in the back of her mind, like a call muffled by the wind. It was the sound of a distant memory, a voice that she had started to forget but desperately clung to all the same. It was her mother's voice, twisted in the sorrow of her lost daughter. Afterall, Kagome banished without a trace. She vividly remembered those moments, the way the day had begun, what she had for breakfast and the last thing she had said to her mother. It was haunting, those memories, because it was like any other time she had slipped between worlds. She had woken, listless, because she had no purpose outside of school. She could find a job, and was scheduled for an interview that day. Her heart hadn't been in it, but it was what she needed to do.<br/><br/>She remembered the feeling of dread, sucking it up and giving herself a pep talk that she could do this. That she could progress in the life that she was meant to now that things had been settled in the past. Of course, she had the lingering feeling that she no longer belonged in her own time or her own life. Not with everything that she had left behind.<br/><br/>Kagome remembered the feeling of the wood beneath her fingers, the way her hand had curled into the handle to slide the door open. She remembered that she paused, turning to her mother with a bright and vibrant smile as she shook herself from her stupor. "I'm taking off." She remembered how strong her voice sounded, the smile on her mother's lips as her eyes shone with pride. Her mother bade her farewell, which didn't seem any different than before but somehow the weight of the words settled in heavier on Kagome's shoulders the more she reflected.<br/><br/>Briefly, the thoughts flickered forward, wondering if her mother worried over her, missed her like she did. Kagome could openly admit that her mother's strength, her support for the fact that her daughter slipped through time so frequently. There were times when she thought herself weak for not having the woman to lean on.<br/><br/>However, she remembered that she did muster up a meager amount of strength.She could remember the shift in the air, the temperature notably different than what she had expected, blinking at the sudden and unfamiliar surroundings. It was not her family's shrine. And when she turned to go back, to slip through the door she had come through, she was met with unfamiliar and cold metal beneath her fingertips and an interior that was not the entrance of her house. A man stood before her, behind a counter, who stared at her with eyes as wide as her own.<br/><br/>She didn't panic, at least. Being torn through time and placed in impossible situations at least built your willpower as far as strange happenings went. Because it wasn't every day that someone found themselves dragged into the past by a demon, intent on ripping a powerful jewel from their body that they didn't even know was there. And then there was the fact that she had shattered said powerful jewel into who knows how many pieces and was tasked on finding them. Such things were not normal, and she had needed to square up and roll with it once she realized that was her reality. It had seemed so simple, just gather the shards and fix the jewel.<br/><br/>But it hadn't been easy, there were many demons after the shards and the jewel itself. And one particularly powerful demon with a wish that he was determined to see fulfilled. To this day, she had never learned his wish but knew it had never been granted even once he had the blasted thing completed. He had ruined so many lives for the sake of nothing. Ruined so many lives for such a futile task. Naraku had been the most difficult foe, and the one who had been the center of everything that had gone wrong in all of her friend's lives.<br/><br/>But, it was that unpredicability, that necessity to roll with what was happening and the willpower that she had gained from her adventure that she remembered drawing upon to come up with a story that fit in the moment that didn't seem too whimsical or far fetched. She needed to be believed, she needed to survive.<br/><br/>Afterall, she faced worse than a man in a camera store. She had lied through her teeth to save her life before.<br/><br/>"I was looking for a job." In the end, it wasn't a complete lie. After all, she had set out of her house with the intent of attending a job interview. Her state of dress would at least attest to that much. It was one of the easier fibs she had ever told.<br/><br/>And, for some reason, that crazy man hired her.<br/><br/>かごめ<br/><br/>Kagomed rolled over in her bed as she pushed back the distant memories, refusing to acknowledge that she was really awake. She clawed at the last glimpses of sleep, begging it to return and to take her back into its embrace. She closed her eyes, willing sleep to come and was only met with memories. The echoes of a song sang in the distance of her memories, a song that had often tormented her, given the same name as her. The voice that sang was no longer reminiscent of her mother, but the voices of children who she had often played with growing up. They called back the memories, even though it had been years since she started this live, even though she was happy in this life, the call of these memories was too loud.<br/><br/>Suddenly, she was falling back into them and sleep evaded her again. She was watching herself in her family's embrace while Inuyasha was pulled back into the well, looking as startled as she had felt. The memories of that moment, those feelings, were still so strong. The feeling of heartbreak and sorrow welled up again though it had been so long since she had felt like she had been ripped away from everything that mattered to her.<br/><br/>Of course her family mattered, and she was happy to be in their arms again. She could never fully, truly describe how she had felt in those days. She still couldn't explain the way she felt split in two, with warring desires to be in both her past and present. She remembered the futile attempts to jump through the well, fingers clawing at the ground in a desperate plea to let her return. The first month home, she didn't sleep so much as she cried.<br/><br/>Elysion had garnished a similar reaction, though it was not so fierce because she didn't know exactly where she had slipped through nor did she know where she could worm her way back. Her explorations were subtle between working her job and trying to settle herself into this life. She had no intentions of staying, no intentions of lingering longer than she needed. And while she didn't try as fiercely as she had when she tried to return to the past, her passion was tenfold because she had no ties to this world. Because she was truly alone… With no hope of anyone to reach her.<br/><br/>In her irrational moments, she thought the Jewel had pulled her back and found a new hell for her to reside in. A new hell that would force her to make a wish, but she remembered very clearly that she had wished it gone forever. That didn't stop her dreams, the times when she woke up in the night sobbing. And those memories of her past were the hardest to deal with, the hardest to forget. Her heart began to race in a panic as she turned in her bed again, her breath became a struggle as she fought against a panic attack induced by her wandering mind this late into the night.<br/><br/>She hated feeling so weak, so afraid.<br/><br/>籠の中の鳥は<br/><br/>Kagome finally pulled herself from bed, her room lit with a pale light that was enough to guide her to the bathroom. She stood before the mirror, the sink running while she stared at her reflection. Raven colored hair covered her face and she felt as bad as she looked. Her first morning in Elysion was similar to this, only she was in worse shape.<br/><br/>She had found a place to sleep, managing to work out a deal with the owner of the building to allow her to stay a small period of time without paying. Perhaps it had been Miroku's influence that allowed her to strike such deals, as the monk was known for his way in charming (or scamming) people into giving them more than enough for the work they had done. The monk had always been that way, since they had first met. He would claim the dwelling of a lord to be haunted when it was not or, claim that they were subject to an attack when they would not be. He would sell his wards and charms for such high prices. It worked practically every time and she wondered why people had been so willing to trust him.<br/><br/>Perhaps it was his smile, or the fact that he was a monk that the people of the past were so willing to crumble. He never preyed on the weak, at least. He always did what was right and he was a symbol of strength to her at times when he would push through everything in order to do what was right. He pushed through the fact that he was dying, that he was cursed, and tried to do something about it rather than wallowing in his fate. He had pushed himself to the limit in the time leading up to their final fight. And she had been glad that they had defeated Naraku before he could become subject to the same fate as his father, and his father before him.<br/><br/>As far as her own charms went, however, she was more fair than her friend and made the deal reasonable. She doubted that anyone in this world would pay a hefty price for an exorcism or banishing demons. They were too technologically advanced for that. But she was clever enough, and smart enough, to make a good deal.<br/><br/>But now, Kagome was in a better place though the look on her face looked the same. Haunted, tired, drained...<br/><br/>A quick glance at a clock on the wall told her that she could try to sleep longer. But she opted out of that, not wanting to face the flashbacks again. She took a shower instead, using the cold water to chase away her demons, to fill her lungs with a sharp intake of breath and force herself awake.<br/><br/>いついつ出やる<br/><br/>It didn't work.<br/><br/>Not in the way she was wanting. The cold water certainly forced the air into her lungs, forced her mind to wake and muscles to seize. A bitter laugh was pulled from her lips as she tilted her head back and found herself remembering more. Today, she wasn't going to escape them so easily. She wasn't going to recover so simply, to recover just because she willed it.<br/><br/>Sometimes, there's no avoiding the thoughts you wanted to. Even when you were certain that you were past them.<br/><br/>Sango would have been a great help in this situation. The demon slayer was her best friend, she would even go as far as to call her the sister that she never had. An older sister who was wise, always had her side when trouble arose. Particularly boy trouble, when such things were rather trivial but it was fun to have a crush and for her friend to be mad on her behalf when Inuyasha made her sad. After all, it had been often that the half-demon would run to his dead lover's side and break her heart more than once.<br/><br/>But, Sango also inspired her in other ways. After all the woman had faced, she had always been so strong, so sure... Even in the times that she had doubted herself, she always pulled through. She admired that she had the ability to survive after losing her whole family -- the reminder of this often pushed Kagome to survive, because she lost everyone to this world -- and then having her brother become a pawn of Naraku. It wasn't easy, couldn't have been something to that just anyone could face and still go forward with. She still smiled, even with that pain and those reminders... She was often so bright, even in the darker times.<br/><br/>And right now, she wanted to lean into the older woman's side, to take comfort in the fact that she was there and she was supportive. She felt that Sango would somehow pull through this, and offer some words of strength and understanding. It was times like these that made these spells worse, the constant reminder that she was without her family.<br/><br/>"I don't want to be alone." She cried aloud in her solitude, the sound of the shower drowning out the plea.<br/><br/>She wasn't afraid to admit it.<br/><br/>夜明けの晩に<br/><br/>Another hour had slipped by before she had realized it. Her skin was cold from the water and it felt like ice ran through her veins. She hadn't realized she had begun to shiver until her hand reached to turn off the water and end her shower. Kagome didn't seek her own gaze in the mirror again, instead, she wrapped herself in towels and trudged out of the bathroom, up the stairs and into her kitchen. She started on making a light breakfast, idly reading through her notes for the day as the food cooked.<br/><br/>Her career was really taking off these last years. Her photos were featured in many galleries, her name started to frequent many lips for those who were interested in photography.<br/><br/>The job she had asked for on a whim had sparked it all. She had been far more lucky than she had expected to be in this world. Never lucky enough to slip back through the cracks into her own world, but lucky enough to do well. As she turned back to the stove, she remembered the time she had finally given up on returning home. It was about two years into her life here, as she had started to venture into photography as more than just a hobby but something she could make a name for herself with.<br/><br/>That day had been particularly pleasant, the sun was high in the sky and she had found herself taking some photos of the natural scenery. A little boy had hidden in one of the plants, and she had caught a picture of the moment his face had settled into a cheerful, mischievous grin the moment before he had jumped out to startle his prey. It reminded her of Shippou, the little kitsune she had, essentially, adopted. He, too, had been torn from his family when they had first met. His father killed and he was determined to avenge him. While young, he did seem so mature in their first encounters.<br/><br/>Maybe it had been the influence of Inuyasha that allowed the kit to act like a kid again, to be young and whimsical at times while others he was more mature. He offered comfort to her in his own way, and she tried to care for him as she would her own though she had been so young then as well. However, her youth did not stop her from understanding how to tend to him or care for him like her child. Her heart swelled when he smiled, when he had been so happy for his gift of crayons and took the time to make art. She was so proud of each drawing that he had finished that she knew that this was how a mother would feel in such a situation.<br/><br/>The pain that had ripped through her was too much, too sudden. She missed him and wanted to see how much he had grown since she had been gone. She had missed so much...<br/><br/>To spare herself any further pain, any false hopes… She gave up. And focused on bettering herself.<br/><br/>鶴と亀が<br/><br/>Breakfast tasted bland, boring, and inspired. Only after she had finished did she realized she had forgotten to any sort of spices or flavor to the food. It was too late now to remember that much, as her mind was too busy remembering other details of her life that clearly had become more important than her food.<br/><br/>"Sit!"<br/><br/>Of course, nothing happened when she had angrily yelled at one particularly frustrating client that reminded her of the half-demon. He was being particularly stubborn and rude, wanting a photo taken his way rather than letting it work out naturally. You could try to force wild animals to behave how you wanted. But, rarely did anyone succeed with force. Inuyasha wasn't as bad, however. Inuyasha had learned before she had been forced away from him. He had become gentler, more understanding, more mature though there were times he was still childish and cocky.<br/><br/>She remember how red her cheeks had burned, but how she stood her ground and fired him. She told him she refused to work for anyone or with anyone who wanted to twist something beyond it's nature, beyond it's own desires.<br/><br/>She should have compared the man to Naraku rather than Inuyasha. Though her client did not have such extreme intentions. At least the feeling afterwards was a pleasant memory. The freedom of knowing that she had come so far that she could refuse work that she didn't want to do, to be her own person that was independent of others. She could say that she made it at that point. Even though she heard rumors days later with words meant to slander her.<br/><br/>She defended herself righteously, like she did towards the end of her journey. After all, she was the only one who could protect herself in this world.<br/><br/>滑った<br/><br/>Morning light began to creep into her home, reminding her again of the passage of time. Again, she considered the list of things she had to do and debated on where to start. Or, if she should even start at all. With how the day began, she didn't know if she could consider that a great idea. It was doubtful that she would be successful with how lost in herself she was becoming.<br/><br/>She didn't want to mess up her latest work. Because she had done that on a few occasions before. It wasn't pleasant to try and recover from a complete disaster.<br/><br/>Kagome remembered the feeling of her expensive, brand new, camera slipping from her hands. She wasn't prepared to support it, because she had just removed it from her bag. Part of her screamed on the inside. A dramatic, over-the-top, full on scream that she frequently did when she was much, much younger. When she was struggling to make it through middle school while hopping between times. The other part of her had remained frozen in place while her lense completely shattered and the rest of the camera had broken along with it.<br/><br/>Seeing Inuyasha's brother, a full demon, standing before her was the last thing she expected when she had made her way out for her photos. He stood as proud as ever, as tall as ever, as imposing as she remembered. He didn't look fazed at all to be in an entirely different world, though she was never the best at reading his mind. His name on her lips was so potent, that she could remember the tiniest feelings as she did. Her lips were chapped, her mouth felt dry, and the bubbling feeling of anxiety in her stomach made her feel sick.<br/><br/>She didn't want her hopes to be up.<br/><br/>But, she wanted him to be there, even if they were not friends. They were allies, if anything, since they had fought side by side. And something was better than absolutely nothing.<br/><br/>And Kagome had the sense enough not to throw herself at him, to wrap her arms around him in relief that knowing she was not alone. Her camera no longer mattered when she approached him. She remembered that nothing else mattered for days as she spent time with him, not speaking of their world but speaking (or, she was speaking and he simply acknowledged that fact).<br/><br/>When, exactly, she fell for him though… Kagome couldn't recall. It was a subtle thing, just like he was. But she knew the feeling was there. And he let her know that she was not alone in the fact that she had fallen, that feelings had somehow blossomed.<br/><br/>後ろの正面<br/><br/>A feeling of weightlessness overtook her and suddenly her eyes opened while her mind desperately clawed for the last thing she was doing. She didn't recall when she had fallen asleep on her couch, but she knew the last place she had been was on the far too comfortable cushions. She didn't struggle, however, or fight the weightlessness as she was in familiar arms. Her head tilted against Sesshoumaru's chest, taking comfort in the fact that he was here and she wasn't alone.<br/><br/>"Welcome back." His response was a soft hum in acknowledgement. He didn't need to speak much for her to understand his intent, or the rest of what he had to say.<br/><br/>He carried her back to her bed, settled her into it with ease. Her eyes met his and she smiled easily because no more memories drifted back, no more recollections teased at her. No, whenever he was near, she never fell back into those thoughts. He had helped, and the years had helped. Today was just… One of those days.<br/><br/>"Sleep." He commanded with ease, her eyes rolled at him but she did not fight because she was tired. Her hand clung tightly to him, while she felt his opposite hand press to her forehead in assessment of her wellbeing.<br/><br/>"I'm okay," she said, her words firm with her promise.<br/><br/>She was okay. She was alive. And she was happy.<br/><br/>だあれ<br/><br/>shipper<br/><br/>summary<br/><br/>Kagome, at one point in her life, was a rather regular teenage girl until she was attacked by a demon inside her family's well house. The demon dragged her down into the well, which magically transported her about 500 years into the past. There, she learned that a sacred jewel was encased inside her body as she was the reincarnation of a priestess that had died 50 years prior to the time she was dragged into. The jewel was ripped from her body and the demon that dragged her through time was defeated by the half-demon that she freed who was pinned to the tree. Kagome befriended the half-demon, Inuyasha, in time and traveled with him to restore the jewel that she, herself, shattered. Though it was not so straightforward and easy to do as many demons and humans sought the jewel for their own purposes. She befriended a young kitsune demon, a monk, and a demon slayer who all traveled with her to restore the jewel.<br/><br/>Her group, however, was not the one to complete the jewel. Instead, an evil half-demon who manipulated the majority of the major events in most of her companion's lives. When he finally collected all the pieces of the jewel and made his wish on the tainted object, Kagome was drawn into the jewel itself with the intent of her making a selfish wish to keep her trapped inside forever, keeping the jewel alive. It was the stubbornness of Inuyasha that managed to save her from the darkness. In the end, she returned to her natural time, finished high school as was expect from a girl of her timeline. Though days later, Kagome ended up in Elysion. She has been in this world for five years, and has long since given up on returning home. She's settled happily into her new life.<br/><br/>platonic<br/><br/>It's rather easy for Kagome to make new friends, she hasn't changed much from her youth. She is a cheerful young woman who is empathetic and welcoming to most of all in her life. In her youth, she befriended demons when most would fear them. Even demons that used to eat humans, she has befriended and she changed their ways (she'd like to think). This being said, it's really easy to become her friend as long as someone is able to shown that they are willing to be redeemed, or show that they are not completely evil. She feels greatly for everyone she meets, so it's hard for her not to be drawn to others in a desire to be friends.<br/><br/>antagonistic<br/><br/>The only way to earn Kagome's wrath is to be so deplorable, so evil, and so far beyond redemption that she can't see any good in you. And she can see the good in pretty much everyone and everything. Honestly, with whom she has faced? A half-demon that pitted two lovers against each other, that cursed the entire male line of one of her friends, and then had her best friend's brother kill their family… Yeah, I don't see her hating anyone without them really, really working for it. Feel free to give it a shot, though.<br/><br/>romantic<br/><br/>When in love, Kagome is a strong support, always staying there even when things may be rough. However, Kagome is not looking for love, wasn't looking for love when she arrived so any past relationships don't exist. This isn't to say that someone hasn't fallen in love with her. She can definitely be the subject of someone's unrequited love, she'll probably be oblivious about it, though. Finally, Kagome is currently engaged to Sesshoumaru, surprisingly. I'm totally open to potential AU things, though. <3<br/><br/>fandom hell<br/><br/>age ancient<br/><br/>species space queen<br/><br/>occupation dying<br/><br/>prefers she/her<br/><br/>awards<br/><br/>pro<br/>she/her est 62woo i suck at plot replies. but ok anyway!!! neptune is very friendly and has that 'cool' persona, he's really fun to be around, and he's SUPER good to work with. like he's super patient and he'll do anything she asks of him--he's really easy to work with, definitely in comparison to other models. so i love the idea of them being all work oriented friends at first and then turning into something more. neptune definitely tries to surround himself with people, because he loves having friends, and kagome is pretty much his type too? like she's sweet and she's a strong woman, and he is actually better friends with women than he is with men, idk why, he just loves being surrounded by female friends who knows. i love my guys being super good friends and protecting their girl friends honestly. but oh M A N i love pseduo-family type relationships and neptune is an only child, so he hasn't had any like, familial relationships like that. so her looking out for him all big sister like would make him be like ????? cause he's confused but also he actually really likes that LOL! they're both good kids, i think they'd be really fun ^^<br/><br/>fandom fire emblem: fates<br/><br/>age ninteen<br/><br/>species Part human / part dragon<br/><br/>occupation representative guardian<br/><br/>prefers she/her<br/><br/>awards<br/><br/>yonder<br/>she/her aest 20 posts<br/><br/>I haven't seen Inuyasha at all but... from what I've read Kagome seems to be one of those people who might be able to help Corrin out with her emotional state.

Frankly she hasn't worked through everything yet since she was essentially at the head of a full-scale war.

I love your idea of Kagome taking a pic of Elsa! You know, she's also a singer/performer at a local theater so I can imagine Kagome going there to scope things out and then catching Elsa backstage or something--and then the friendship could blossom from there!

Potrafi również wyczuwać demoniczne aury, jak również złe aury. Kiedy jednak urodziła się i dorastała, jej moce były zapieczętowane i była znacznie mniej potężna. Od czasu porażki tego, który zapieczętował jej moce, Kagome osiągnęła swój pełny potencjał.<br/><br/>OCZYSZCZENIE Nawiązując fizyczne połączenie, Kagome ma zdolność oczyszczania zarówno trucizny, jak i ciemności z podmiotu (żywego i nieożywionego). Aby to zrobić, projektuje swoje duchowe moce poprzez swoją rękę.<br/><br/>DUCHOWE BARIERY Dzięki pełnemu potencjałowi Kagome ma zdolność tworzenia bariery wokół siebie i rozszerzania jej wokół innych. Jest to bariera w kształcie kopuły, która może zniszczyć słabe demony, które nawiązują kontakt z barierą.<br/><br/>ULEPSZONE WZROKI<br/>Kagome ma zdolność widzenia rzeczy, które są często niewidoczne dla ludzkiego oka: duchy, duchy, boskie i złe aury.<br/><br/>MOŻLIWOŚCI Z BRONIĄ<br/>Kagome posiada umiejętność używania łuku i strzały. Była samodzielnie wyszkolona, a po latach praktyki jej strzała rzadko mija swój znak. Oprócz tego, Kagome ma zdolność napełniania strzał mocami. Potrafi wpajać strzały swoimi mocami duchowymi, co pozwala im przenikać demoniczne siły, niszczyć zaklęcia i oczyszczać przedmioty. Potrafi wpajać łuk swoimi mocami i odpychać ataki wroga. Ma zdolność napełniania strzał energią oczyszczającą, aby oczyścić truciznę, a także potężne, dalekie ataki demoniczne. I wreszcie, ma zdolność do ominięcia innych za pomocą strzały: jeśli jej cel znajduje się za barierą lub zakładnikiem, strzała może się teleportować i uderzyć tylko w jej cel.<br/><br/>Pozostałe jej zdolności stały się dość nieistotne, ponieważ są związane z podróżowaniem w czasie (przez Studnię Pożeracza Kości), Klejnotem Shikon lub jej poprzednią inkarnacją.<br/><br/>kanon<br/><br/>Kagome została wyciągnięta kilka dni po ukończeniu szkoły średniej, jednak przed otwarciem studni Bone Eater, aby umożliwić jej powrót do przeszłości na stałe.<br/><br/>freestyle<br/><br/>pamięć<br/><br/>かごめ<br/><br/>Dźwięk jej imienia był łagodnym szeptem w jej umyśle, jak wołanie przytłumione przez wiatr. Był to dźwięk odległego wspomnienia, głosu, który zaczęła zapominać, ale rozpaczliwie trzymała się tego samego. Był to głos jej matki, skręcony w smutku zagubionej córki. W końcu Kagome wygnała się bez śladu. Pamiętała te chwile, sposób, w jaki zaczął się dzień, co jadła na śniadanie i ostatnie, co powiedziała matce. Te wspomnienia były przerażające, bo to było jak każdy inny czas, w którym wślizgnęła się między światami. Obudziła się, niezdarna, ponieważ nie miała żadnego celu poza szkołą. Mogła znaleźć pracę i tego dnia była zaplanowana na rozmowę kwalifikacyjną. Jej serce nie było w nim, ale to było to, co musiała zrobić.<br/><br/>Pamiętała uczucie przerażenia, wysysanie go i wygłaszanie przemowy, że może to zrobić. Że może posunąć się naprzód w życiu, do którego została przeznaczona teraz, gdy sprawy zostały rozstrzygnięte w przeszłości. Oczywiście miała utrzymujące się uczucie, że nie należała już do własnego czasu ani do własnego życia, nie ze wszystkim, co zostawiła po sobie.<br/><br/>Kagome przypomniała sobie uczucie lasu pod palcami, sposób, w jaki jej ręka zwinęła się w uchwyt, aby otworzyć drzwi. Przypomniała sobie, że zatrzymała się, zwracając się do matki z jasnym i żywym uśmiechem, gdy drżała z ogłuszenia. Pamiętała, jak głośno brzmiał jej głos, uśmiech na ustach jej matki, gdy jej oczy świeciły z dumą. Jej matka pożegnała się z nią, co nie wydawało się niczym innym niż wcześniej, ale w jakiś sposób ciężar słów osiadł ciężej na ramionach Kagome, im bardziej się zastanowiła.<br/><br/>Krótko, myśli migotały do przodu, zastanawiając się, czy jej matka martwiła się o nią, tęskniła za nią tak jak ona. Kagome mogła otwarcie przyznać, że siła jej matki, jej poparcie dla faktu, że jej córka tak często poślizgiwała się w czasie. Były chwile, kiedy myślała, że jest słaba, bo nie musi się na niej opierać.<br/><br/>Pamiętała jednak, że zgromadziła niewielką ilość siły, pamiętała przesunięcie w powietrzu, temperaturę znacznie różniącą się od tego, czego się spodziewała, migając na nagłe i nieznane otoczenie. Nie była to świątynia jej rodziny. A kiedy odwróciła się, aby wrócić, aby przemknąć przez drzwi, które przeszła, spotkała się z nieznanym i zimnym metalem pod jej końcówkami palców i wnętrzem, które nie było wejściem do jej domu. Mężczyzna stał przed nią, za ladą, patrząc na nią oczami tak szerokimi jak jej własne.<br/><br/>Przynajmniej nie panikuje, bo jest rozdarta w czasie i postawiona w niemożliwych sytuacjach. Ponieważ nie każdego dnia ktoś znalazł się zaciągnięty w przeszłość przez demona, zamierzającego wyrwać potężny klejnot ze swojego ciała, o którym nawet nie wiedzieli, że tam jest. A potem był fakt, że rozbił powiedział potężny klejnot na kto wie, ile kawałków i miał za zadanie znaleźć je. Takie rzeczy nie były normalne, i musiała kwadrat i toczyć się z nim, gdy zdała sobie sprawę, że jest to jej rzeczywistość. Wydawało się to takie proste, wystarczy zebrać odłamki i naprawić klejnot.<br/><br/>Ale to nie było łatwe, było wiele demonów po kawałkach i klejnot sam. I jeden szczególnie potężny demon z pragnieniem, że był zdeterminowany, aby zobaczyć spełnienie. Do dnia dzisiejszego nigdy nie dowiedziała się o jego życzeniu, ale wiedziała, że nie spełniło się ono nawet wtedy, gdy skończył tę przeklętą rzecz. Zrujnował tak wiele istnień dla nicości. Zrujnował tak wiele istnień dla tak daremnego zadania. Naraku był najtrudniejszym wrogiem i tym, który był w centrum wszystkiego, co poszło nie tak w życiu jej przyjaciółki.<br/><br/>Ale to była ta nieprzewidywalność, ta konieczność toczenia się z tym, co się działo, i siła woli, którą zdobyła ze swojej przygody, którą pamiętała, aby wymyślić historię, która pasowałaby do chwili, która nie wydawałaby się zbyt kapryśna lub daleko przyciągnięta. Musiała uwierzyć, musiała przeżyć.<br/><br/>W końcu zmierzyła się z czymś gorszym niż mężczyzna w sklepie z aparatami fotograficznymi.<br/><br/>"Szukałam pracy." W końcu nie było to kłamstwo. W końcu wyszła z domu z zamiarem uczestniczenia w rozmowie kwalifikacyjnej. Jej stan ubrań przynajmniej potwierdzałby to. Było to jedno z łatwiejszych kłamstw, jakie kiedykolwiek powiedziała.<br/><br/>I z jakiegoś powodu ten wariat ją wynajął.<br/><br/>かごめ<br/><br/>Kagomed przewróciła się w swoim łóżku, gdy odpychała odległe wspomnienia, nie chcąc przyznać, że naprawdę nie śpi. W ostatnim przebłysku snu złamała pazury, błagając go, by wrócił i zabrał ją z powrotem w swoje ramiona. Zamknęła oczy, chętnie spała i spotkała się tylko ze wspomnieniami. Echo piosenki śpiewało w oddali jej wspomnień, piosenka, która często ją męczyła, nadając jej to samo imię. Głos, który śpiewała, nie przypominał już jej matki, ale głosy dzieci, z którymi często bawiła się dorastając. Przywołali wspomnienia, mimo że minęły lata odkąd zaczęła to życie, mimo że była szczęśliwa w tym życiu, wołanie tych wspomnień było zbyt głośne.<br/><br/>Nagle wpadła z powrotem do nich, a sen znów ją ominął. Obserwowała siebie w objęciach swojej rodziny, podczas gdy Inuyasha została wciągnięta z powrotem do studni, wyglądając tak przerażona, jak się czuła. Wspomnienia z tamtej chwili, te uczucia, były wciąż tak silne, że uczucie złamania serca i smutku znów się wypełniło, chociaż tak dawno nie czuła, jakby została oderwana od wszystkiego, co dla niej ważne.<br/><br/>Oczywiście jej rodzina miała znaczenie i była szczęśliwa, że znów jest w ich ramionach. Nigdy nie była w stanie w pełni, prawdziwie opisać, co czuła w tamtych czasach. Nadal nie potrafiła wytłumaczyć, w jaki sposób czuła się podzielona na dwie części, z walczącymi pragnieniami bycia zarówno w przeszłości, jak i teraźniejszości. Pamiętała daremne próby skoku przez studnię, palce ściskające o ziemię w rozpaczliwej prośbie, aby pozwolić jej powrócić. W pierwszym miesiącu po powrocie do domu nie spała tyle, ile płakała.<br/><br/>Elysion wywołała podobną reakcję, choć nie była taka zaciekła, ponieważ nie wiedziała dokładnie, gdzie się poślizgnęła, ani nie wiedziała, gdzie mogłaby znaleźć drogę powrotną. Jej poszukiwania były subtelne między pracą w pracy a próbą osiedlenia się w tym życiu. Nie miała zamiaru pozostać, nie miała zamiaru pozostać dłużej, niż potrzebowała. I chociaż nie próbowała tak mocno, jak próbowała wrócić do przeszłości, jej pasja była dziesięciokrotna, ponieważ nie miała żadnych więzi z tym światem, ponieważ była naprawdę samotna... bez nadziei, że ktokolwiek ją dosięgnie.<br/><br/>W swoich irracjonalnych chwilach myślała, że Klejnot pociągnął ją z powrotem i znalazł nowe piekło, w którym mogłaby mieszkać. Nowe piekło, które zmusiłoby ją do życzenia, ale pamiętała bardzo wyraźnie, że chciała, aby to odeszło na zawsze. To nie powstrzymywało jej marzeń, czasów, kiedy budziła się w nocy, płacząc, a wspomnienia z przeszłości były najtrudniejsze do zniesienia, najtrudniejsze do zapomnienia. Jej serce zaczęło biec w panice, gdy ponownie odwróciła się w łóżku, jej oddech stał się walką, gdy walczyła z atakiem paniki wywołanym przez jej wędrowny umysł tak późno w nocy.<br/><br/>Nienawidziła czuć się tak słaba, tak przerażona.<br/><br/>籠の中の鳥は<br/><br/>Kagome w końcu wyciągnęła się z łóżka, jej pokój oświetlony bladym światłem, które wystarczyło, aby poprowadzić ją do łazienki. Stała przed lustrem, zlew biegł, a ona patrzyła na swoje odbicie. Kruk z kolorowymi włosami zakrył jej twarz i czuła się tak źle, jak wyglądała. Jej pierwszy poranek w Elysion był podobny do tego, ale była w gorszej formie.<br/><br/>Znalazła miejsce do spania, udało jej się zawrzeć umowę z właścicielem budynku, aby pozwolić jej pozostać przez krótki okres czasu bez płacenia. Być może to wpływ Miroku pozwolił jej na zawieranie takich umów, ponieważ mnich był znany ze swojej drogi do czarujących (lub oszukiwania) ludzi, aby dać im więcej niż wystarczająco za pracę, którą wykonali. Mnich zawsze był taki, odkąd się po raz pierwszy spotkali. Twierdził, że mieszkanie lorda jest nawiedzane, gdy nie było, lub twierdził, że są przedmiotem ataku, gdy nie będą. Sprzedawał swoje oddziały i uroki za tak wysokie ceny. Praktycznie za każdym razem zadziałało i zastanawiała się, dlaczego ludzie tak chętnie mu ufają.<br/><br/>Być może był to jego uśmiech, albo fakt, że był mnichem, że ludzie z przeszłości byli tak gotowi się rozbić. Nigdy nie łowił słabych, przynajmniej. Zawsze robił to, co było słuszne i był dla niej symbolem siły, gdy przepychał się przez wszystko, aby zrobić to, co było słuszne. Przeszedł przez fakt, że umiera, że jest przeklęty, i próbował coś z tym zrobić, zamiast walić się w swoim przeznaczeniu. Pchnął się do granicy w czasie prowadzącym do ich ostatecznej walki. I była szczęśliwa, że pokonali Naraku, zanim on mógł stać się przedmiotem tego samego losu, co jego ojciec, a jego ojciec przed nim.<br/><br/>Jeśli chodzi o jej własne uroki, była jednak bardziej uczciwa niż jej przyjaciółka i uczyniła umowę rozsądną. Wątpiła, że ktokolwiek na tym świecie zapłaci wysoką cenę za egzorcyzmy lub wypędzenie demonów. Byli zbyt zaawansowani technologicznie na to. Ale była na tyle sprytna i na tyle sprytna, by zawrzeć dobrą umowę.<br/><br/>Ale teraz Kagome znalazła się w lepszym miejscu, chociaż jej twarz wyglądała tak samo. Nawiedzona, zmęczona, osuszona...<br/><br/>Szybkie spojrzenie na zegar na ścianie powiedziało jej, że może spróbować spać dłużej. Ale ona zdecydowała się z tego, nie chcąc stawić czoła retrospekcjam. Zamiast tego wzięła prysznic, używając zimnej wody, aby wypędzić demony, napełnić płuca ostrym oddechem i zmusić się do przebudzenia.<br/><br/>いついつ出やる<br/><br/>Nie zadziałało.<br/><br/>Nie w sposób, w jaki chciała. Zimna woda z pewnością zmusiła powietrze do jej płuc, zmusiła jej umysł do obudzenia się, a mięśnie do przejęcia. Gorzki śmiech został wyciągnięty z jej ust, gdy pochyliła głowę do tyłu i zaczęła pamiętać więcej. Dziś nie zamierzała im tak łatwo uciec, nie chciała wyzdrowieć tak łatwo, tylko dlatego, że tego chciała.<br/><br/>Czasami nie można unikać myśli, których chciałeś, nawet wtedy, gdy byłeś pewny, że je przeszedłeś.<br/><br/>Sango byłaby wielką pomocą w tej sytuacji. Zabójczyni demonów była jej najlepszą przyjaciółką, nawet zaszłaby tak daleko, aby nazwać ją siostrą, której nigdy nie miała. Starsza siostra, która była mądra, zawsze miała swoją stronę, gdy pojawiły się problemy. Szczególnie chłopiec kłopoty, gdy takie rzeczy były raczej trywialne, ale to było zabawne mieć zakochać się i dla jej przyjaciela, aby być wściekły w jej imieniu, gdy Inuyasha zrobił ją smutną. Wszakże często zdarzało się, że półdemon biegł do boku swojej zmarłej kochanki i złamał jej serce więcej niż raz.<br/><br/>Ale Sango zainspirował ją również na inne sposoby. Po tym wszystkim, z czym się zmierzyła, zawsze była taka silna, taka pewna... Nawet w czasach, gdy wątpiła w siebie, zawsze wychodziła z tego. Podziwiała, że miała zdolność przetrwania po utracie całej rodziny - przypominanie o tym często popychało Kagome do przetrwania, ponieważ straciła wszystkich na tym świecie - a następnie jej brat stał się pionkiem Naraku. To nie było łatwe, nie mogło być czymś, z czym każdy mógł zmierzyć się i nadal iść naprzód. Ona nadal uśmiechała się, nawet z tym bólem i tymi przypomnieniami... Często była taka jasna, nawet w mrocznych czasach.<br/><br/>I właśnie teraz, chciała pochylić się po stronie starszej kobiety, pocieszyć się faktem, że była tam i wspierała. Czuła, że Sango jakoś to przeżyje i zaoferuje kilka słów siły i zrozumienia. To właśnie takie chwile pogorszyły te zaklęcia, stałe przypomnienie, że była bez rodziny.<br/><br/>"Nie chcę być sam." Krzyczała głośno w jej samotności, dźwięk deszczu topiące się błaganie.<br/><br/>Nie bała się przyznać.<br/><br/>夜明けの晩に<br/><br/>Minęła godzina, zanim się zorientowała. Skóra była zimna z wody i czuła, jakby lód płynął przez jej żyły. Nie zdawała sobie sprawy, że zaczęła drżeć, dopóki nie wyciągnęła ręki, aby wyłączyć wodę i zakończyć prysznic. Kagome nie szukała własnego spojrzenia w lustrze, zamiast tego owinęła się ręcznikami i wybiegła z łazienki, w górę schodami i do kuchni. Zaczęła przygotowywać lekkie śniadanie, bezczynnie czytając notatki na dzień, gdy gotowało się jedzenie.<br/><br/>Jej kariera naprawdę się rozkręcała w ostatnich latach. Jej zdjęcia były prezentowane w wielu galeriach, jej nazwisko zaczęło cześcić wiele warg dla tych, którzy interesowali się fotografią.<br/><br/>Praca, o którą prosiła z kaprysu, wywołała wszystko. Miała dużo więcej szczęścia, niż się spodziewała na tym świecie. Nigdy nie miała szczęścia, by poślizgnąć się z powrotem przez pęknięcia w swoim własnym świecie, ale miała szczęście, by dobrze sobie radzić. Kiedy wróciła do pieca, przypomniała sobie, że w końcu zrezygnowała z powrotu do domu. To było około dwóch lat w jej życiu tutaj, ponieważ zaczęła podejmować się fotografii jako coś więcej niż tylko hobby, ale coś, co może zrobić sobie sławę z.<br/><br/>Ten dzień był szczególnie przyjemny, słońce było wysoko na niebie i znalazła się robiąc kilka zdjęć naturalnych krajobrazów. Mały chłopiec ukrył się w jednej z roślin, a ona uchwyciła obraz chwili, w której jego twarz osiadła w radosnym, niegrzecznym uśmiechu w chwili, zanim wyskoczył, aby przestraszyć swoją ofiarę. Przypomniało jej to Shippou, małe kitsune, które zasadniczo adoptowała. On również został oderwany od swojej rodziny, gdy się po raz pierwszy spotkali. Jego ojciec zabił i był zdeterminowany, aby go pomścić. Kiedy był młody, wydawał się tak dojrzały w swoich pierwszych spotkaniach.<br/><br/>Być może to wpływ Inuyasha pozwolił zestawowi zachowywać się jak dziecko, być młodym i kapryśnym czasami, podczas gdy inni byli bardziej dojrzali. Oferował jej pocieszenie na swój własny sposób, a ona starała się o niego dbać tak, jak ona o siebie, chociaż była wtedy taka młoda. Jednak jej młodość nie powstrzymała jej od zrozumienia, jak się nim opiekować lub opiekować się nim jak swoim dzieckiem. Jej serce pękło, gdy się uśmiechał, kiedy był tak szczęśliwy z powodu prezentu kredki i poświęcił czas na tworzenie sztuki. Była tak dumna z każdego rysunku, że skończył, że wiedziała, że tak matka czułaby się w takiej sytuacji.<br/><br/>Ból, który ją rozdarł, był zbyt silny, zbyt nagły. Tęskniła za nim i chciała zobaczyć, jak bardzo wyrósł, odkąd jej nie było. Tak bardzo jej brakowało...<br/><br/>Żeby oszczędzić sobie bólu, fałszywych nadziei, zrezygnowała i skupiła się na poprawie samopoczucia.<br/><br/>鶴と亀が<br/><br/>Śniadanie smakowało łagodnie, nudno i inspirowało. Dopiero po zakończeniu zdała sobie sprawę, że zapomniała o jakichkolwiek przyprawach lub smaku do jedzenia. Było już za późno, by przypomnieć sobie tak wiele, ponieważ jej umysł był zbyt zajęty pamiętaniem innych szczegółów z jej życia, które najwyraźniej stały się ważniejsze niż jej jedzenie.<br/><br/>"Siedź!"<br/><br/>Oczywiście nic się nie stało, gdy wściekle krzyczała na jednego szczególnie frustrującego klienta, który przypominał jej o pół-demonie. Był szczególnie uparty i niegrzeczny, pragnąc zrobić zdjęcie, zamiast pozwolić mu działać naturalnie. Możesz spróbować zmusić dzikie zwierzęta, aby zachowywały się tak, jak chcesz. Ale rzadko komu się udało siłą. Inuyasha nie był jednak tak zły. Inuyasha nauczyła się, zanim została zmuszona do odejścia od niego. Stał się łagodniejszy, bardziej wyrozumiały, bardziej dojrzały, chociaż były chwile, kiedy był jeszcze dziecinny i zarozumiały.<br/><br/>Pamięta, jak czerwone jej policzki poparzyły się, ale jak stała na ziemi i go zwolniła. Powiedziała mu, że odmawia pracy dla nikogo lub z kimkolwiek, kto chciał skręcić coś poza naturą, poza własnymi pragnieniami.<br/><br/>Powinieneś był porównać go do Naraku, a nie do Inuyashy. Chociaż jej klientka nie miała tak ekstremalnych intencji. Przynajmniej uczucie potem było przyjemnym wspomnieniem. Wolność, by wiedzieć, że zaszła tak daleko, że mogła odmówić pracy, której nie chciała, by być osobą niezależną od innych. Mogła powiedzieć, że zrobiła to w tym momencie. Mimo, że kilka dni później usłyszała plotki, które miały ją oczerniać.<br/><br/>Broniła się sprawiedliwie, tak jak pod koniec swojej podróży, bo tylko ona mogła się bronić na tym świecie.<br/><br/>滑った<br/><br/>Światło poranne zaczęło wkradać się do jej domu, przypominając jej o upływie czasu. Znowu rozważała listę rzeczy, które musiała zrobić, i dyskutowała, od czego zacząć. Albo, czy powinna w ogóle zacząć. Nie wiedziała, jak ten dzień się zaczął, czy mogłaby uznać to za świetny pomysł. Wątpiła, czy odniesie sukces z tym, jak zagubiona w sobie staje się.<br/><br/>Nie chciała zepsuć swojej najnowszej pracy, bo robiła to kilka razy wcześniej, nie było przyjemnie próbować wyzdrowieć po całkowitej katastrofie.<br/><br/>Kagome przypomniała sobie uczucie, że jej drogi, zupełnie nowy, aparat wyślizguje się z rąk. Nie była gotowa go wspierać, bo właśnie wyjęła go z torby. Część jej krzyczała od środka. Dramatyczny, over-the-top, pełen krzyku, który często robiła, gdy była dużo, dużo młodsza. Kiedy walczyła o przejście przez szkołę średnią, skacząc między czasami. Druga część pozostała zamrożona na miejscu, podczas gdy jej soczewka całkowicie się rozbiła, a reszta kamery zepsuła się wraz z nią.<br/><br/>Widząc brata Inuyashy, pełnego demona, stojącego przed nią, była ostatnią rzeczą, jakiej oczekiwała, gdy wyszła na zdjęcia. Stał tak dumny, jak nigdy, tak wysoki, jak nigdy, tak imponujący, jak tylko pamiętała. Nie wydawało mu się, że jest w zupełnie innym świecie, chociaż ona nigdy nie była najlepsza w czytaniu jego myśli. Jego imię na ustach było tak silne, że pamiętała nawet najmniejsze uczucia. Jej usta były popękane, usta suche, a uczucie niepokoju w żołądku sprawiło, że poczuła się chora.<br/><br/>Nie chciała, żeby jej nadzieje się podniosły.<br/><br/>Ale chciała, żeby tam był, nawet jeśli nie byli przyjaciółmi. Byli sojusznikami, jeśli w ogóle, ponieważ walczyli ramię w ramię. I coś było lepsze niż absolutnie nic.<br/><br/>A Kagome miała na tyle rozsądku, by nie rzucać się na niego, obejmować go ramionami z ulgą, wiedząc, że nie jest sama. Jej aparat nie miał już znaczenia, kiedy się do niego zbliżyła. Pamiętała, że nic innego nie miało znaczenia przez wiele dni, kiedy spędzała z nim czas, nie mówiąc o ich świecie, ale mówiąc (albo ona mówiła, a on po prostu przyznał się do tego faktu).<br/><br/>Kiedy, dokładnie, zakochała się w nim... Kagome nie mogła sobie przypomnieć. To była subtelna rzecz, tak jak on. Ale wiedziała, że uczucie tam jest. I dał jej do zrozumienia, że nie jest sama w tym, że upadła, że uczucia jakoś rozkwitły.<br/><br/>後ろの正面<br/><br/>Poczucie nieważkości ogarnęło ją i nagle otworzyły się jej oczy, podczas gdy jej umysł rozpaczliwie trzymał się ostatniej rzeczy, którą robiła. Nie pamiętała, kiedy zasnęła na kanapie, ale wiedziała, że ostatnie miejsce, w którym była, było na zbyt wygodnych poduszkach. Nie walczyła jednak ani nie walczyła z nieważkością, jak była w znajomych ramionach. Jej głowa pochyliła się do klatki piersiowej Sesshoumaru, czerpiąc pociechę z faktu, że on tu był, a ona nie była sama.<br/><br/>"Witaj z powrotem." Jego odpowiedź była łagodnym szumem w uznaniu. Nie musiał wiele mówić, aby zrozumieć jego intencję lub resztę tego, co miał do powiedzenia.<br/><br/>Zawiózł ją z powrotem do łóżka, z łatwością ją w nim osiedlił. Jej oczy spotkały się z jego, a ona uśmiechnęła się z łatwością, ponieważ nie ma już wspomnień, które drażniły ją. Nie, za każdym razem, gdy był blisko, nigdy nie wpadła w te myśli. Pomógł, a lata pomogły. Dzisiaj był po prostu... jeden z tych dni.<br/><br/>"Sleep." Rozkazał z łatwością, jej oczy toczyły się na niego, ale nie walczyła, ponieważ była zmęczona. Jej ręka mocno przylgnęła do niego, podczas gdy czuła jego przeciwległą rękę naciskając na jej czoło w ocenie jej dobrego samopoczucia.<br/><br/>"Jestem w porządku", powiedziała, jej słowa mocno z jej obietnicą.<br/><br/>Żyła i była szczęśliwa.<br/><br/>だあれ<br/><br/>spedytora<br/><br/>Podsumowanie<br/><br/>Kagome, w pewnym momencie swojego życia, była dość zwykłą nastoletnią dziewczyną, dopóki nie została zaatakowana przez demona wewnątrz studni jej rodziny. Demon zaciągnął ją do studni, która magicznie przeniosła ją około 500 lat w przeszłość. Tam dowiedziała się, że święty klejnot był zamknięty w jej ciele, ponieważ była reinkarnacją kapłanki, która zmarła 50 lat przed czasem, w którym została wciągnięta. Klejnot został wyrwany z jej ciała, a demon, który ciągnął ją przez czas, został pokonany przez pół-demon, którego uwolniła, który został przykuty do drzewa. Kagome zaprzyjaźniła się z pół-demonem, Inuyashą, w czasie i podróżowała z nim, aby przywrócić klejnot, który sama rozbiła. Chociaż nie było to tak proste i łatwe do zrobienia, jak wiele demonów i ludzi szukało klejnotu dla własnych celów. Zaprzyjaźniła się z młodym demonem kitsune, mnichem i zabójcą demonów, który podróżował z nią, aby przywrócić klejnot.<br/><br/>Jednak jej grupa nie była tą, która ukończyła klejnot. Zamiast tego, zły pół-demon, który manipulował większością głównych wydarzeń w większości życia jej towarzysza. Kiedy w końcu zebrał wszystkie kawałki klejnotu i złożył życzenie na skażonym obiekcie, Kagome została wciągnięta w sam klejnot z intencją, aby zrobiła samolubne pragnienie, aby utrzymać ją uwięzioną w środku na zawsze, utrzymując klejnot przy życiu. To właśnie uparcie Inuyashi udało się uratować ją z ciemności. W końcu wróciła do swojego naturalnego czasu, skończyła liceum, czego oczekiwała od dziewczyny z jej osi czasu. Chociaż kilka dni później, Kagome skończyła w Elysion. Jest na tym świecie od pięciu lat i już dawno zrezygnowała z powrotu do domu.<br/><br/>platoński<br/><br/>Dla Kagome nawiązanie nowych przyjaźni jest dość łatwe, niewiele się zmieniła od młodości. Jest wesołą młodą kobietą, która jest empatyczna i gościnna przede wszystkim w swoim życiu. W młodości zaprzyjaźniła się z demonami, gdy większość się ich obawiała. Nawet demony, które kiedyś zjadały ludzi, zaprzyjaźniły się i zmieniły ich sposób (chciałaby myśleć). To powiedziawszy, to jest naprawdę łatwe, aby stać się jej przyjacielem tak długo, jak ktoś jest w stanie pokazać, że są gotowi do odkupienia, lub pokazać, że nie są całkowicie złe. Ona czuje się bardzo dla każdego, kogo spotyka, więc trudno jej nie być pociągniętym do innych w chęci bycia przyjaciółmi.<br/><br/>antagonistyczne<br/><br/>Jedynym sposobem, aby zdobyć gniew Kagome jest być tak żałosny, tak zły, i tak daleko od odkupienia, że nie może zobaczyć w tobie nic dobrego. I może zobaczyć dobro w prawie każdym i we wszystkim. Szczerze mówiąc, z kim miała do czynienia? Pół-demon, który postawił dwóch kochanków przeciwko sobie, który przeklął całą męską linię jednego ze swoich przyjaciół, a potem kazał bratowi jej najlepszej przyjaciółki zabić ich rodzinę... Czuj się wolny, żeby dać mu szansę.<br/><br/>romantyzmu<br/><br/>Kiedy jest zakochana, Kagome jest silnym wsparciem, zawsze pozostaje tam, nawet gdy rzeczy mogą być trudne. Jednak Kagome nie szuka miłości, nie szukał miłości, gdy przybyła, więc żadne przeszłe relacje nie istnieją. To nie znaczy, że ktoś się w niej nie zakochał. Na pewno może być przedmiotem czyjejś nieodwzajemnionej miłości, ale prawdopodobnie o tym zapomni. Wreszcie, Kagome jest obecnie zaręczona z Sesshoumaru, co zaskakujące.

| Why You Should be on Twitter<br/><br/>Disclaimer: I am not, nor have I ever claimed to be, a social media guru. I'm just a person who thinks about stuff a lot, and this has come up a number of times.<br/><br/>I'm not an early adopter. Sometimes it takes me years to figure out what I want to use something for before I actually get on it, and Twitter was one of those things. I've been on Twitter seriously since about February of this year, so I'm pretty new at it. Still, I've learned a number of things, and I wanted to share them. Some people say I'm a Twitter pusher, and I am, because there's lots of good reasons to get on it, and virtually no downsides.<br/><br/>So what's Twitter? If you're on the internet, you've probably at least heard of it. It's a social media network that serves as a forum for conversations, updates, and news in a medium more public than something like Facebook or LinkedIn. Facebook is about who wants to find you, but Twitter is about who you want to find. Your favourite writers, actors, politicians, singers, and scientists are probably on Twitter. So are your favourite charities, radio stations, news sites, and stores. And they want you to find them and listen to what they have to say. Everyone on Twitter, at least initially, wants to talk with you.<br/><br/>But why join that? Why be a part of it? There's all kinds of reasons, and I'm going to give you a few.<br/><br/>People and Places Twitter is a great way to find out about events which are going on around the world, but also in your community. If you're travelling and looking for things to do, it's a great way to find out about things relevant to your interests (because the people you follow are people you're interested in). Even if you're not travelling, knowing about great places to go locally or knowing that people you're interested in are going to them creates an opportunity to meet them and create a deeper relationship with them. If you go back to my party post, all the people in it but two, I heard about on Twitter and then met in real life, and now we're pretty good friends. And the more you do this, the more things you'll find out about, and the more people you'll meet. And if you follow them on Twitter, you already know a bit about what they're like. They want you to. The reverse is also true, because tweeting invites people to see what you're like, and they can make the same choices about you.<br/><br/>Inspiration and Motivation<br/>Inspiration comes from the strangest places, and the influx of tweets means there's always fresh content for your imagination. I have a follow first policy, so I'll follow just about anybody, and then periodically go through and unfollow people. I don't know who's going to plant the seed of a new blog post or new project in me, so I like to keep my options open. Motivation also happens, because Twitter is just like life. If you surround yourself with people who are ambitious, dedicated, generous, and hard-working, it's easier to be like that, and push yourself. It's easier to think that if they can plan events, launch projects, or just get up in the morning, well, so can you.<br/><br/>Learning and Lifestyle Bloggers are on Twitter. Bloggers who aren't may actually be crazy. And people blog about just about everything. If you're looking to learn something, odds are good that somebody's tweeting about it. On top of that, news services and stores are also connected, which means that you can get your news up to the minute, and find out about sales and deals as they start.As far as lifestyle, looking for new recipe ideas? Follow some caterers and see what they come up with. Need a twist for that cocktail party? Twitter's got people for that too. Wardrobe recommendations, or just want to see what other people are doing with their lives? It's all there.<br/><br/>There are some common challenges I face when talking about this, and they're legitimate obstacles. It can seem pretty daunting, especially if you're getting on the bandwagon late, like I did. I spent months following only two people and not knowing what else to do. But there are ways to overcome them, and hear they are from least frequent to most.<br/><br/>#3: Twitter is for Narcissistic Jerks<br/>I think this comes from the idea that most people tweet for and about themselves as a way of getting attention. What I don't get is why there's anything wrong with that, or why doing that makes one a narcissist or a jerk. If someone has something to say, they want to be heard. Used to be you'd stand on the street corner and yell. Now you can yell in 140 characters or less. Twitter's just a new way to be heard. Now, there are certainly narcissistic jerks on Twitter. They're pretty much everywhere. Sometimes, people are jerks. Sometimes one of those people is me, I'm sorry to say. Don't follow those people. If you don't like what someone is saying, whether that's points that they're making or detailed accounts of their bathroom activities, you don't have to listen on Twitter.<br/><br/>#2: I Can't Keep Track of It All<br/>The second obstacle people often bring up is that they just don't have time to keep track of all the things which are going on on Twitter. And you know what? That's fine. Keep track of what you can. Maybe you only wander on every few days. If you're a private user (rather than tweeting for your company), and especially a beginner, that's okay. Part of something is better than all of nothing.<br/><br/>#1 I've Got Nothing I Want to Put Out There<br/>This is by far the most frequent challenge people raise. And it doesn't even matter. You don't have to join Twitter to talk. Join it to listen. Again, your favourite authors, singers, bloggers, and newspapers are on here. This is your chance to listen to them. It's your chance to gain a window into their lives and activities, and they're inviting you to do that. Want to find out what Felicia Day is going to be up to at the San Diego Comic Con? Done. I know people who only listen on Twitter, and that's great. That's what I did for a while. Eventually, maybe you'll find something to tweet about, or make something to tweet about. I hope you do, because I want to hear about it.<br/><br/>In short, if you're not using Twitter, I think you should be. If you're not using it to its full extent, try to. Don't be afraid to follow five hundred people, if all of those people are saying things you're interested in. Invite those people into bits of your life, and see how it's improved by the interaction. I look forward to hearing from you. | Dlaczego powinieneś być na Twitterze<br/><br/>Zastrzeżenie: Nie jestem, ani nigdy nie twierdziłem, że jestem guru mediów społecznościowych. Jestem po prostu osobą, która dużo myśli o rzeczach, a to pojawiło się kilka razy.<br/><br/>Nie jestem wczesnym adoptorem. Czasami potrzebuję lat, aby dowiedzieć się, do czego chcę coś użyć, zanim faktycznie dostanę się na to, a Twitter był jedną z tych rzeczy. Jestem na Twitterze poważnie od lutego tego roku, więc jestem w tym całkiem nowy. Nauczyłem się wielu rzeczy i chciałem się nimi podzielić. Niektórzy ludzie mówią, że jestem tweeterem, a tak jest, ponieważ jest wiele dobrych powodów, aby się tym zająć, i praktycznie nie ma wad.<br/><br/>Więc czym jest Twitter? Jeśli jesteś w Internecie, prawdopodobnie przynajmniej o nim słyszałeś. Jest to sieć społecznościowa, która służy jako forum do rozmów, aktualizacji i wiadomości w medium bardziej publicznym niż coś takiego jak Facebook lub LinkedIn. Facebook jest o tym, kto chce Cię znaleźć, ale Twitter jest o tym, kogo chcesz znaleźć. Twoi ulubieni pisarze, aktorzy, politycy, piosenkarze i naukowcy są prawdopodobnie na Twitterze. Tak samo są twoje ulubione organizacje charytatywne, stacje radiowe, serwisy informacyjne i sklepy. I chcą, żebyś ich znalazł i wysłuchał tego, co mają do powiedzenia. Każdy na Twitterze, przynajmniej na początku, chce z tobą porozmawiać.<br/><br/>Ale po co do tego dołączać? Po co być tego częścią? Są różne powody, a ja podam kilka.<br/><br/>Ludzie i miejsca Twitter to świetny sposób, aby dowiedzieć się o wydarzeniach, które mają miejsce na całym świecie, ale także w Twojej społeczności. Jeśli podróżujesz i szukasz rzeczy do zrobienia, jest to świetny sposób, aby dowiedzieć się o rzeczach istotnych dla Twoich zainteresowań (ponieważ ludzie, których śledzisz, to ludzie, którymi jesteś zainteresowany). Nawet jeśli nie podróżujesz, wiedza o świetnych miejscach do udania się lokalnie lub wiedza, że ludzie, którymi jesteś zainteresowany, idą do nich, stwarza okazję do spotkania się z nimi i nawiązania z nimi głębszych relacji. Jeśli wrócisz do mojego posta na imprezie, wszystkich ludzi w nim oprócz dwóch, usłyszałem o nim na Twitterze, a potem spotkałem się w prawdziwym życiu, a teraz jesteśmy całkiem dobrymi przyjaciółmi. Im więcej to robisz, tym więcej rzeczy dowiesz się i więcej ludzi poznasz. I jeśli śledzisz ich na Twitterze, już wiesz trochę o tym, jak wyglądają. Chcą, żebyś to zrobił. Odwrotnie jest również prawdą, ponieważ tweetowanie zaprasza ludzi do zobaczenia, kim jesteś, i mogą dokonać tych samych wyborów o tobie.<br/><br/>Inspiracja i motywacja<br/>Inspiracja pochodzi z najdziwniejszych miejsc, a napływ tweetów oznacza, że zawsze jest świeża treść dla twojej wyobraźni. Mam pierwszą zasadę, więc będę śledzić prawie każdego, a następnie okresowo przechodzić i nie śledzić ludzi. Nie wiem, kto we mnie posadzi nasienie nowego wpisu na blogu lub nowego projektu, więc lubię utrzymywać otwarte opcje. Motywacja również się zdarza, ponieważ Twitter jest jak życie. Jeśli otaczasz się ludźmi, którzy są ambitni, oddani, hojni i ciężko pracujący, łatwiej jest być takim i popchnąć się. Łatwiej jest myśleć, że jeśli mogą planować wydarzenia, uruchamiać projekty lub po prostu wstawać rano, to ty też możesz.<br/><br/>Blogerzy uczenia się i stylu życia są na Twitterze. Blogerzy, którzy nie są, mogą być szaleni. I ludzie blogują o prawie wszystkim. Jeśli chcesz się czegoś nauczyć, są szanse, że ktoś o tym tweetuje. Co więcej, usługi informacyjne i sklepy są również połączone, co oznacza, że możesz uzyskać wiadomości na bieżąco i dowiedzieć się o sprzedaży i ofertach, gdy zaczynają. Jeśli chodzi o styl życia, szukasz nowych pomysłów na przepisy? Obserwuj kilka placówek gastronomicznych i zobacz, co wymyślą. Potrzebujesz skrętu na tę imprezę koktajlową? Twitter ma też do tego ludzi. Zalecenia dotyczące szafy lub po prostu chcesz zobaczyć, co inni ludzie robią ze swoim życiem? To wszystko.<br/><br/>Jest kilka typowych wyzwań, z którymi borykam się, gdy o tym mówię, i są to uzasadnione przeszkody. To może wydawać się dość zniechęcające, zwłaszcza jeśli wsiadasz do wagonu tak późno, jak ja. Spędziłem miesiące podążając za dwoma osobami i nie wiedząc, co jeszcze zrobić. Ale są sposoby, aby je pokonać i usłyszeć, że są od najmniej częstych do najbardziej.<br/><br/>#3: Twitter jest dla narcystycznych kretynów<br/>Myślę, że pochodzi to z idei, że większość ludzi tweetuje dla siebie i o sobie jako sposobie przyciągania uwagi. Nie rozumiem, dlaczego jest w tym coś złego, lub dlaczego robienie tego sprawia, że jesteś narcyzem lub kretynem. Jeśli ktoś ma coś do powiedzenia, chce być wysłuchany. Kiedyś byś stał na rogu ulicy i krzyczał. Teraz możesz krzyczeć w 140 znakach lub mniej. Twitter to po prostu nowy sposób na wysłuchanie. Teraz na Twitterze z pewnością są narcystyczne kretyny. Są prawie wszędzie. Czasami ludzie są kretynami. Czasami jednym z tych ludzi jestem ja, przykro mi to mówić. Nie idź za tymi ludźmi. Jeśli nie podoba ci się to, co ktoś mówi, czy to punkty, które robią, czy szczegółowe relacje o swoich działaniach w łazience, nie musisz słuchać na Twitterze.<br/><br/>#2: Nie mogę utrzymać tego wszystkiego<br/>Drugą przeszkodą, o której ludzie często wspominają, jest to, że po prostu nie mają czasu, aby śledzić wszystkie rzeczy, które dzieją się na Twitterze. I wiesz co? To w porządku. Śledź, co możesz. Może tylko wędrujesz co kilka dni. Jeśli jesteś użytkownikiem prywatnym (zamiast tweetować dla swojej firmy), a zwłaszcza początkującym, to w porządku. Część czegoś jest lepsza niż nic.<br/><br/>#1 Nie mam nic, co chcę tam umieścić<br/>Jest to zdecydowanie najczęstsze wyzwanie, które ludzie stawiają. I to nawet nie ma znaczenia. Nie musisz dołączyć do Twittera, aby mówić. Dołącz do niego, aby słuchać. Ponownie, twoi ulubieni autorzy, piosenkarze, blogerzy i gazety są tutaj. To twoja szansa, aby ich wysłuchać. To twoja szansa, aby uzyskać okno w ich życiu i działaniach, i zapraszają cię do tego. Chcesz dowiedzieć się, co Felicia Day będzie robić na San Diego Comic Con? Gotowe. Znam ludzi, którzy słuchają tylko na Twitterze, i to jest świetne. To jest to, co robiłem przez chwilę. W końcu może znajdziesz coś, o czym możesz tweetować, lub coś, o czym możesz tweetować. Mam nadzieję, że to zrobisz, ponieważ chcę o tym usłyszeć.<br/><br/>Krótko mówiąc, jeśli nie używasz Twittera, myślę, że powinieneś. Jeśli nie używasz go w pełni, spróbuj. Nie bój się śledzić pięciuset osób, jeśli wszyscy ci ludzie mówią rzeczy, które cię interesują. Zaproś tych ludzi do części swojego życia i zobacz, jak to się poprawi dzięki interakcji. Czekam na wiadomość od ciebie. |
| Root Canals<br/><br/>The very thought of getting a root canal puts most people on edge. SCM Dental utilizes the latest technology and technique to make a root canal a virtually pain free and low stress procedure.<br/><br/>Rotary endodontics is an advanced technology and technique to perform endodontic treatment, the clinical term for a root canalThe term "root canal" refers to the natural cavity at the center of the tooth. The tooth's nerve is located in soft tissue (pulp) inside the root canal. If the tooth is damaged either by trauma or decay, debris can enter the sensitive root canal area and cause an infection, or in extreme circumstances, and abscess. An abscessed tooth is very serious and should be treated as an emergency, as it can create an infection that may spread to other parts of the body. If you believe you have an abscessed tooth, contact our office immediately to schedule emergency care.<br/><br/>Depending on the case, root canal therapy may require more than one visit. An initial x-ray will be taken to evaluate the tooth and root canal and determine the extent of the damage and infection if present. You will be given a form of anesthesia to make you relaxed.<br/><br/>When the area is numb, our dentist will create an access chamber to the root canal using an electric handpiece. Next, the root canal will be scraped of the infected or damaged tissue and nerve. Once the entire area has been throughly cleaned and polished, the tooth will be filled with a biocompatible rubber compound called gutta percha. The tooth is then covered with a dental filling or dental crown to restore strength and function.<br/><br/>Endodontic therapy has a bad reputation as being a painful procedure. With rotary endodontics, a root canal procedure is no more painful than having a dental filling placed. The infection and damage to the nerve is what creates the extreme pain and discomfort and patients you will experience significant relief after undergoing root canal therapy. Root canals have a success rate of 95% and allow people to preserve their natural teeth. | Kanały korzeniowe<br/><br/>Sama myśl o uzyskaniu kanału korzeniowego stawia większość ludzi na krawędzi. SCM Dental wykorzystuje najnowszą technologię i technikę, aby kanał korzeniowy praktycznie bezbolesny i niski poziom stresu.<br/><br/>Endodoncja obrotowa to zaawansowana technologia i technika wykonywania leczenia endodontycznego, termin kliniczny dla kanału korzeniowegoTermin "kanał korzeniowy" odnosi się do naturalnej jamy w centrum zęba. Nerw zęba znajduje się w tkance miękkiej (pulp) wewnątrz kanału korzeniowego. Jeśli ząb jest uszkodzony albo przez uraz lub próchnicę, gruzu może wejść do wrażliwego obszaru kanału korzeniowego i spowodować infekcję, lub w ekstremalnych okolicznościach, i ropień. Ropień zęba jest bardzo poważny i powinien być traktowany jako nagły wypadek, ponieważ może powodować infekcję, która może rozprzestrzeniać się na inne części ciała. Jeśli uważasz, że masz ropnia zęba, skontaktuj się z naszym biurem natychmiast zaplanować nagłą pomoc.<br/><br/>W zależności od przypadku, terapia kanałowa może wymagać więcej niż jednej wizyty. Wstępne prześwietlenie rentgenowskie zostanie wykonane w celu oceny kanału zębowego i korzeniowego oraz określenia zakresu uszkodzenia i infekcji, jeśli są obecne. Otrzymasz formę znieczulenia, aby się zrelaksować.<br/><br/>Gdy obszar jest zdrętwiały, nasz dentysta stworzy komorę dostępu do kanału korzeniowego za pomocą elektrycznego uchwytu. Następnie kanał korzeniowy zostanie zeskrobany z zainfekowanej lub uszkodzonej tkanki i nerwu. Po oczyszczeniu i polerowaniu całego obszaru ząb zostanie wypełniony biokompatybilnym związkiem gumowym zwanym gutta percha. Ząb jest następnie pokryty wypełnieniem dentystycznym lub koroną dentystyczną, aby przywrócić siłę i funkcję.<br/><br/>Terapia endodontyczna ma złą reputację jako bolesna procedura. W przypadku endodoncji obrotowej zabieg kanałowy nie jest bardziej bolesny niż umieszczenie wypełnienia zęba. Zakażenie i uszkodzenie nerwu jest tym, co powoduje skrajny ból i dyskomfort, a pacjenci doświadczą znacznej ulgi po poddaniu terapii kanałowej. Kanały korzeniowe mają wskaźnik sukcesu 95% i pozwalają ludziom zachować swoje naturalne zęby. |
| Churchyard Bottom Wood<br/><br/>Highgate<br/><br/>Churchyard Bottom Wood, Highgate<br/><br/>Now called Queen's Wood<br/><br/>Between 1860 and 1880 the centre was torn out of the City of London to build sewers, railways and new roads. Houses were demolished without regard for the tenants who had to find whatever accommodation they could elsewhere. Managers went to livo in Kensington and St. John's Wood, while the poorest crowded into the rookeries like Seven Dials and Lisson Grove. For those between, the clerks and skilled workmen, speculative builders put up row after row of terraced villas and Mr Pooter moved into Holloway. The people of Muswell Hill watched houses creep across the fields of Finsbury Park, up Crouch Hill and down the other side, so that by 1880, Crouch End was being developed and there seemed no way to stem the flow. Ten years later the large estates of Muswell Hill were being sold. Upton Farm was sold and the Ecclesiastical Commissioners wanted to develop Churchyard Bottom Wood, now called Queen's Wood. The story would have made an Ibsen play. Two groups of honest, highly motivated people fighting for what they each thought was right. The Ecclesiastical Commissioners on the one hand and the Committee of the Hornsey Charities on the other, both believed they were doing their best for other people, and the public rose against them both in indignation<br/><br/>At that time Muswell Hill Road was a country road, with Southwood Hall at one end and Upton Farm at the other. By 1894, Onslow Gardens was built, Connaught Gardens marked out, and builders were poised to develop the Woodlands estate. Cut out of Churchyard Bottom Wood was a group of tumble-down cottages, on a triangular site. An undated map, held by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners shows six Wasteland Cottages with an opening between them - not a road, not metalled, but a way through to the strawberry beds behind. Further along was another gap which led to footpaths through the wood. These two openings were to be the basis of the plan. The same two gaps and the cleared ground, which was the strawberry field, can be seen in the 1894 map below. They are shown as 'Muswell Hill Cottages' and, quite in passing, Peter Sellers was to live on the same site much later on. To develop the wood as a housing estate, the Commissioners needed to drive two roads through from Muswell Hill Road and build houses along them. The Muswell Hill Road frontage alone would not have provided room for enough houses to make the venture worthwhile.<br/><br/>The land and cottages had been given much earlier as almshouses to house old people and were held on their behalf by the Trustees of the Hornsey Charity Commissioners. By the 1890s the cottages were tumble-down, in need of major repair. Public-spirited, wishing to do the best for their old tenants, the Trustees could not improve them since they had no money. Some years before the Ecclesiastical Commissioners had planned to develop Gravel Pit Wood (now Highgate Wood) as a housing estate, but this had met such opposition that they backed down. Instead, in 1886, they gave all 69 acres woodland to the public. At the same time they offered to sell Churchyard Bottom Wood to Hornsey Urban District Council for £25,000, but this was too much for Hornsey to raise on its own. The Council said that people living outside Hornsey also enjoyed the wood and other authorities should help, but no help was given. In the end the offer fell into abeyance.<br/><br/>Map showing the Muswell Hill Cottages which were the centre of the controversy.<br/><br/>Muswell Hill Road about 1880<br/><br/>It seems probable that these three pairs of cottages<br/>were the ones at the centre of the dispute.<br/><br/>The Ecclesiastical Commissioners wanted to raise money for its church work in Britain and abroad. They considered that they had been given the land to be used for the propogat­ion of religion and if this meant selling off land or woods, it was a lesser evil than restricting the work of the church. They had given Gravel Pit Wood to the public: in its place they would develop Churchyard Bottom Wood.<br/><br/>The Trustees of the Hornsey Charities wanted to produce an income to help their poor people, so they made an offer to the Commissioners. Their triangular piece of land was too awkwardly shaped to be developed economically, but if the Commissioners would grant them some more land to make it into a square site, they would build twenty-five neat villas. These would bring in ground rents of £225 per annum, which could be used to relieve the poverty of Hornsey people. In return they would permit the Commission­ers to cut two roads through their land so that the Commissioners could develop the woods.<br/><br/>When this offer became known people immediately reacted with alarm.<br/><br/>On the 16th December 1893 Mr Carvell Williams MP asked in the House of Commons, if the Ecclesiastical Commissioners had consented to sell a strip of land to the Hornsey Charities Trustees on condition that an existing road be widened to 40 feet, whether this was a preliminary to a building scheme and if the House of Parliament would have an opportunity to express an opinion.<br/><br/>Mr Leveson Gower, a Church Estates Commissioner replied',"Yes" to the first part.<br/><br/>Mr Carvell Williams, "Do I understand it is the intention to destroy that portion of Highgate Woods by building on it?"<br/><br/>Two days later The Star published an article worthy of any modern tabloid.<br/><br/>The Star<br/>18th December 1893<br/><br/>'Parliament must keep a keen watch on those old vandals and confederates of the jerry-builder the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. They are always alienating some piece of land or are favouring the builders as opposed to the general public. The Commissioners would not sell the Churchyard Bottom wood to the ratepayers but now propose 'to open it up' by cutting two wide roads through it in connection with one of their numerous building schemes. Will not someone ask a question in Parliament and check the brick and mortar policy of the Commissioners?'<br/><br/>By the time this was printed, the question had been asked and the answer was either untrue, or devious. Other papers took up the story. The Times, in a long report, said that the Comnussioners were not prepared to give an undertaking that Parliament, or any other public body, should have an opportunity of considering any scheme for building on the site of the wood.<br/><br/>The situation simmered for eighteen months until the Ecclesiastical Commissioners were forced to open an enquiry, which began at Highgate on 31 May 1895, chaired by an Assistant Ecclesiastical Commissioner. The Inquiry produced a flurry of newspaper letters of which this was the most important.<br/><br/>The Daily Chronicle, 5 June 1895<br/><br/>VANDALISM AT HIGHGATE<br/><br/>Sir –<br/><br/>One of the most lovely bits of woodland in suburan London is threatened. Will you help us to ward off what would be a calamity, not only to the immediate district, but to the whole of densely-populated North London? In no part of the metropolis has the builder been more active than in Crouch End and Hornsey. The beautiful meadows of a year or two ago are now houses and shops. Ballast heaps have taken the place of stately elms and chestnuts, and once pleasant villages are sharing the fate of Stroud Green, Harringay, Finsbury Park, Highbury and Islington. ---<br/><br/>---- The object is the construction of two forty-foot roads through the woods. We in this district know the meaning of forty-foot roads through woods. It means that the woods are doomed. Ten years ago agitation saved the sister-wood of sixty-five acres - The Gravel Pit Woods - and no one who saw the Bank Holiday crowds flocking up the Archway Road from the dreary streets of Holloway, Islington and Clerkenwell, and watched the keen enjoyment of the children and family parties picnicking on the grass and among the trees, could fail to realise the immense boon that the grant by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners of this wood has been to the whole of North London, but the Lower Wood of sixty acres has always been regarded as a natural complement of the other. ----<br/><br/>--- The Ecclesiastical Commissioners own nearly one-third of the large parish of Hornsey. By the liberal expenditure of the ratepayers' money in the opening up of roads and the general development of the district, the value of their property has been enormously increased, and from this unearned increment they each year draw large revenues. Surely the ratepayers whose money has thus aided in creating the immense estate may expect liberal treatment in return. ---<br/><br/>Yours obediently,<br/><br/>Signed by The Vicar of St James', Muswell Hill, the Minister of Park Chapel, Crouch End, a barrister living in Onslow Gardens and three members of the District Council.<br/><br/>It was a shot right across the bows of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. Their own religious leaders and the District Council, all up in arms saying in effect that the church was too rich and should be charitable, not greedy. The inclusion of the two clergymen was a shrewd move. Remember to that this was still in the height of the Darwin controversy. Darwin had split belief in the teachings of the Church and many people would have resented the power of the Church from that point of view alone. The Church was not so secure as it pretended to be.<br/><br/>The Evening News, 7 June 1895 said:-<br/><br/>"If the Ecclesiastical Comnussioners are not tackled at once, the building octopus will get a grip of the wood which will be very difficult to loosen later on, ---. Therefore it behoves Londoners to be up and doing if they would save one of their most delightful bits of rustic scenery. The public inquiry stands adjourned to Thursday next, and before then something must be done to convince the Commissioners that the citizens of London will not tolerate the confiscation of one of their favourite playgrounds."<br/><br/>A letter in the Daily Chronicle the next day said:-<br/><br/>.... It was with great relief that that the residents, some ten years ago, heard that the purchase of the Upper Wood had been effected; and how delightful a boon this has proved, anyone who visited them can testify, but all who exerted themselves to save these upper woods, which lie on the west side of Muswell Hill road, felt that their victory was incomplete so long as the sixty acres on the east side remained in danger. It is, as it were, an accident that the woods are divided by a broad high road. Can anyone doubt what the effect would be if the Churchyard Bottom Wood were replaced by rows of small villas, each sending out its contribution of smoke and soot? Can anyone doubt, too, the serious difference it would make to the picturesque setting of the purchased woods if a line of staring new houses were to be run up right over against their leafy frontage?'<br/><br/>This expressed the opinions of many people. In fact, the Gravel Pit Wood, which the writer calls the 'Upper Wood', had not been purchased, but given to the district by the Ecclesiastical Commission, a point they were to reiterate time and again over the years, but most people ignored it. The Commission was not going to give away a second wood whatever anyone said, and held this position to the end.<br/><br/>H.S.Chamberlain, of 5 Cranley Gardens,<br/>in a letter to the Times dated June 8, 1895, urged purchase.<br/><br/>I know that it is common to speak harshly of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, but as the trustees of a fund they are bound to administer it to the greatest advantage, and therefore, if anything is to be done to save the demolition of the wood, it appears to me that it can only be effected by the purchase of the property from the Comnussioners, who I know, are fully alive to the protection of free and open spaces for the people, and who, I feel sure, would be disposed to treat the matter of a purchase in a free and liberal spirit, as they have already done in the matter of the Shepherd's Cot-field, by granting a lease to the Crouch End Playing-fields Company - a small company in which I own a few shares, a small company which was formed exclusively for the purpose of securing the fields for cricket, tennis etc.<br/><br/>(This refers the the Crouch End Playing Fields which had been secured a few years later.)<br/><br/>As Chairman of the Muswell Hill Conservative Association, I am constantly in touch with the inhabitants, and I can safely affirm that every person resident in the neighbourhood would do anything in reason to preserve.<br/><br/>(All he wanted personally was Charity income to support his poor people. He demanded his acre of land - not a great deal surely - he believed the Commissioners' assurance that the wood was not in danger.)<br/><br/>' Muswell Hill Road was one of the best in Hornsey and would remain equally beautiful, houses or no houses',<br/><br/>(and then came the great rhetorical flourish.)<br/><br/>'Are the poor to suffer because of the sentimental objections and the hysterical cry of 'wolf just raised by your correspondents? Something must be done and that soon. An acre of back-land added to the charity-estate would make no apprec­iable difference to the land remaining, while the profit derived from it would succour many poor old and deserving persons in their declining years and enable us to hand over to our successors an estate which in the distant future would be of great value in the rendering of charitable aid to the deserving poor of the parish of Hornsey.'<br/><br/>Reading his letter one senses hysteria very near the surface. Why did he think the Commissioners wanted to build a road? Why should they spend all that money if not to build houses? He never seemed to realise that for an acre of land the the whole wood would be lost. But he had been with the problem for a long time. He was the person to whom the Commissioners had made the offer of sale for £25,000 years before and it is his name which is honoured in a plaque on Crouch End Clock Tower for saving the wood, but his trust in the Ecclesiastical Commissioners seems naive. It is sad that at the Inquiry he was to be cast as the devil.<br/><br/>The Inquiry Continued<br/><br/>The adjourned opened in Highgate on 15 June 1895. Expecting a large gather­ing, the Council Chamber had been changed completely. The usual tables had been removed and the room filled with chairs. By half past seven the room was crowded, with people jostling for seats.<br/><br/>Mr Murray, the Commissioner, said the Inquiry was really a simple one. Hornsey Parochial Charities wished to purchase a piece of land adjoining their charity property at the back. The question was whether the Charity Commission, which controlled all charities, had enough power to stop them. The Church Commissioners were prepared to sell the land at very favourable terms and the income of the Charity would be very considerable increased.<br/><br/>Against this there were three classes of objection.<br/><br/>The original Trust was for the purpose of providing cottages for the Poor, but the trustees were proposing to build villas which would be too expensive for the Poor. However, it was within the power of the Trustees to vary the terms of the Trust, so they could build villas if they thought that the Poor would benefit in the end. The poor people themselves might object, but liberal provisions had already been promised for them. The third objection related to the aesthetic and public side of the question. He took it from what he had read that the Charity Commission ought to interfere to prevent the Ecclesiastical Commissioners from exercising their own discretion in dealing with their own property.<br/><br/>The Inquiry discussed fine points, but the speakers kept coming back to the major problem of preventing any destruction of the wood. The Vestry Clerk of Islington, representing 300,000 people, made a formal protest about any part of the wood, so valuable for the people of Islington and Hornsey being used for private purposes. Mr Wilfred White said that if the Commissioners would give them time they would be able to raise the money to compensate the Trustees.<br/><br/>Mr Beaumont said they did not want villas, they wanted cottages for poor people who were being driven out of the district. Others said that there was no money to build cottages to replace the present delapidated ones but villas would be an economic proposition. Others retorted that there were score of villas to let in Highgate. The Wood was sacred. Stick to the question of the Wood.<br/><br/>Dr Fletcher said the cry among the working people was that there was nowhere to go. Working people came to him with the cry, "We are driven out of Highgate and are obliged to go to Highgate New Town." If the Muswell Hill Road frontage was sold there was no question but that roads might be cut right through the woods in the direction of Hornsey, but if the Commissioners could not get the land from the Charity Commission they could not cut the road.<br/><br/>He was very sure the cottages could be put into a fit state of repair. He was asked by the poor people, by the police and by a number of the working classes to represent these two points, that cottage accommodation was very sorely needed in Highgate and that if they once allowed the land to be sold, there was no telling where the hand of the builder would be stayed.<br/><br/>(Loud and prolonged cheers).<br/><br/>Numerous other people spoke and the Comnussioner summed up by saying that he took it that the prevailing opinion was in favour of retaining the cottages but the meeting should draw no conclusions from what he had said (Groans).<br/><br/>Others said that the Trustees of the Charity had failed in their duties by letting the the cottages fall into disrepair.<br/><br/>Mr H.R.Williams, the Trustee who had written to the paper earlier, said that he had it on the best authority that the Church Commissioners would make no roads whatever and they would not be benefitted one iota by the actions of the Charity Commissioners. Others were far less trusting and the meeting closed after nearly three hours.<br/><br/>'We are faced with the fact that in Highgate and Muswell Hill there are a number of persons who want the Churchyard Bottom Wood and will not be happy until they have got it - while nobody appears willing to spend a farthing to pay for it. Everyone says it would be a fine thing to have the wood as open space, but everybody thinks it is the duty of someone else to make it one. The Islington Vestry has 'resolved' on the subject, but the Islington Vestry does not offer a penny piece towards the purchase. --- There is no more difficult problem for the community or the individual to solve than how to gain possession of other people's property without paying for it.'<br/><br/>Paying for it was indeed the problem as Churchyard Bottom Wood became the subject of intense local and national debate. A joint committee was formed to raise money to save the wood. On 20 November 1896, C.F.Cory-Wright, Hon Treasurer, wrote to The Standard, a daily paper at that time, appealing for help. He reminded everyone of the danger of losing the wood and said it could only be saved by buying it. The Church Commissioners would sell for £25,000 and an extra (5,000 would be required for fencing and drainage, making a total of £30,000. This was too much for Hornsey Council to raise but they had already voted £10,000 towards the total. The woods were of inestimable value to all of North London so he appealed to public bodies and private people to raise the remaining £20,000. He warned that the present offer from the Church Commissioners was open only to the end of 1898. After that the builders would move in.<br/><br/>The appeal was warmly welcomed by the press. A Private Bill was rushed through Parliament and the Highgate Woods Preservation Act, 1897, became law. The Conunittee now had the right to advertise for contributions towards buying the Wood and preserving it.<br/><br/>In a fairly short time almost all the money was raised, but the last few thousand proved very difficult to raise and the Commissioners' deadline was a matter of weeks away. Mr Cory-Wright wrote pleading for more time but was granted a mere three months and then only if interest at 4 per cent was paid for the extra period on the full sum. In the end the London County Council, which had originally offered £2,500, made this up to £5,000 and the total was reached, but it was a close-run thing.<br/><br/>The Council decided to re-name the Wood as 'Queen's Woods' in honour of Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee and Hornsey put on a fine display of bunting when the Duchess of Albany formally declared the Wood open 'for the free use of the public for ever'.<br/><br/>While the campaign to save Churchyard Bottom Wood was run and directed by local people who felt passionately about this particular piece of woodland, they called on the help and experience of a vast network of people, some of whom had worked together on similar campaigns for over thirty years. The Committee issued an appeal, printed on very good quality paper and bearing some famous names.<br/><br/>The questions of open space and public health were major subjects of the Victorian vision.<br/><br/>The Open Spaces Movement<br/><br/>Octavia Hill, the great housing reformer, who had begun with three old houses in Marylebone, bought for her by Jolm Ruskin, had quickly become an expert on housing poor people in the healthiest conditions possible. Her way was to buy leases and then knock down some of the crowded houses in order to bring light and air to the rest, believing that fresh air and sunlight were the the only way poor people could be saved from 'putrid fever. She had learnt this as a child from her grandfather, Southwood Smith, who developed his theories at the Fever Hospital at King's Cross.<br/><br/>He had built the first Industrial Dwellings for poor people and had proved statistically that good air and decent drainage saved lives. Gibson Gardens, in Northwold Road, is a direct outcome of Southwood Smith's ideas. More Information on Gibson Gardens<br/><br/>The Importance of Open Air<br/><br/>Open spaces and the opportunity to breathe clean air, were essential for people living in one or two crowded rooms. Octavia Hill took her charges from the Lisson Grove slums, up Fitzjohn's Avenue to Hampstead Heath. She so loved the Fitzjohn's Avenue fields that she tried to buy them as a public park. They were to cost £10,000 and within three August weeks £8,500 had been raised. It needed only the end of the summer holidays and the return from holiday of sympathetic friends and the further £1,500 would have been raised, but the owners suddenly withdrew their offer. Despite all pleading, the fields were covered with large houses.<br/><br/>From this developed the campaign to save Parliament Hill, the next open space northwards from Lisson Grove, buying up fields in the path of the builders to make a permanent cordon sanitalre against the advancing bricks. The Parliament Hill Fields campaign was so successful that the Hampstead Heath Bill was passed and there was money over from the appeal. From this money and the impetus towards open spaces, was to develop the National Trust. Octavia Hill had been interested in protecting areas like Church Bottom Wood for years, so she was a natural ally in the fight to save the Wood.<br/><br/>The Commons Preservation Society also, was familiar with this kind of agitation and money collection. They had torn down fencing when lords of the manor had enclosed pieces of common land, leading both legal and illegal battles against the arrogant privatization of land traditionally free. Robert Hunter, their Honorary Solicitor from 1868, was always concerned with securing open spaces, large or small, for the public. He, now Sir Robert Hunter, became the Chairman of the Church Bottom Appeal. The Chairman of the Commons Preservation Society was Mr Shaw-Lefevre MP (later Lord Eversley) who played a big part in this and other campaigns in the House of Commons. Octavia Hill had been involved in their work from about 1875.<br/><br/>At the same time Octavia Hill was campaigning for a Burials Bill.<br/><br/>City churchyards had become so full and such a serious a hazard to health, by contaminating wells from which people drew their drinking water, that City burials were no longer permitted. Instead, cemetries were created on the outskirts of town. Abney Park Cemetary was one of these. There was then a movement to remove the headstones to the edges of the old town cemetries, re-inter the bodies elsewhere and turn the cemetries into gardens and open spaces, instead of building on them. This land in the centre of London was very valuable and speculators were avid to obtain it: Even the Quakers had built over one of their cemetries and threatened to do so again by building over Bunhill Fields. Octavia Hill had a network of allies in a dozen fields, so her help to save the Church Bottom Wood must have been invaluable.<br/><br/>The Metropolitan Gardens Society, set up in 1882, had laid out about two hundred small gardens in city centres by 1890. They later handed them over to the Local Authorities, so their support for the Churchyard Bottom Wood Appeal was assured from the start.<br/><br/>The Kyrle Society is forgotten now, but in its day had great influence on Town Planning and Open Space legislation. The Society had been set up about 1875 for 'the Diffusion of Beauty', to bring colour and interest into the lives of people living in dull, drab surroundings. Bright colour to walls and decoration, good singing, open spaces, Nature, Literature and Art. All these fell within the Society's remit. There was a Decorative Branch, for whom William Morris lectured; a Musical Branch to promote choirs and Happy Evenings for people in local school buildings; and a Literature Branch. The Society appealed regularly by letters in The Times, to 'the richer classes' for books and periodicals to be distributed to boys' and girls' clubs, almshouses and elsewhere. However the Open Spaces Committee was the most active. The very name 'Kyrle' came from Pope's The Man of Ross, the philanthropist who gave his birthplace to the people as a public park. | Churchyard Bottom Wood<br/><br/>Highgate<br/><br/>Atrakcje w pobliżu obiektu Churchyard Bottom Wood<br/><br/>Nazywa się Queen's Wood.<br/><br/>Pomiędzy 1860 a 1880 r. centrum zostało wyrwane z londyńskiego City w celu wybudowania kanałów, kolei i nowych dróg. Domy zostały zburzone bez względu na najemców, którzy musieli znaleźć zakwaterowanie w innym miejscu. Menedżerowie poszli do mieszkania w Kensington i St. John's Wood, podczas gdy najubożsi zatłoczyli się w hutach, takich jak Seven Dials i Lisson Grove. Dla tych pomiędzy, urzędników i wykwalifikowanych robotników, spekulatywnych budowniczych postawić wiersz po rzędzie szeregowych willi i pan Pooter przeniósł się do Holloway. Mieszkańcy Muswell Hill obserwowali, jak domy pełzają po polach Finsbury Park, w górę Crouch Hill i w dół po drugiej stronie, tak że do 1880 roku Crouch End był rozwijany i wydawało się, że nie ma sposobu, aby powstrzymać przepływ. Dziesięć lat później duże posiadłości Muswell Hill zostały sprzedane. Upton Farm został sprzedany i Kościelni Komisarze chcieli rozwijać Churchyard Bottom Wood, teraz nazywany Queen's Wood. Historia byłaby Ibsen sztuki. Dwie grupy uczciwych, wysoce zmotywowanych ludzi walczą o to, co każdy uważał za słuszne. Komisarze kościelni, z jednej strony, i Komitet Miłosierdzia Hornseya, z drugiej strony, obaj wierzyli, że robią wszystko, co w ich mocy dla innych ludzi, a opinia publiczna podniosła się przeciwko nim oburzeniem.<br/><br/>W tym czasie Muswell Hill Road była drogą wiejską, z Southwood Hall na jednym końcu i Upton Farm na drugim. Do 1894 roku, Onslow Gardens został zbudowany, Connaught Gardens oznaczone, a budowniczowie byli gotowi do rozwoju majątku Woodlands. Wycięte z Churchyard Bottom Wood było grupą zawalonych domków, na trójkątnym miejscu. Niedatowana mapa, przechowywana przez Komisarzy Kościelnych, pokazuje sześć Domków Pustkowia z otworem między nimi - nie droga, nie metalizowana, ale droga do łóżek truskawkowych z tyłu. Dalej była kolejna szczelina, która prowadziła do ścieżek przez drewno. Te dwa otwory miały być podstawą planu. Te same dwie szczeliny i oczyszczony grunt, który był polem truskawkowym, można zobaczyć na poniższej mapie z 1894 roku. Są one pokazywane jako "Muswell Hill Cottages" i, całkiem mijając, Peter Sellers miał żyć w tym samym miejscu znacznie później. Aby rozwinąć drewno jako osiedle mieszkaniowe, komisarze musieli przejechać dwie drogi z Muswell Hill Road i budować wzdłuż nich domy. Sam front Muswell Hill Road nie zapewniłby wystarczającej ilości domów, aby opłacało się to przedsięwzięcie.<br/><br/>Ziemia i domki zostały oddane znacznie wcześniej jako domy jałmużny do mieszkania starych ludzi i były utrzymywane w ich imieniu przez powierników Komisarzy Miłosierdzia Hornsey. Do 1890 roku domki zostały zawalone, wymagające poważnego remontu. Powiernicy, nastawieni do spraw społecznych, pragnąc jak najlepiej służyć swoim starym najemcom, nie mogli ich ulepszyć, ponieważ nie mieli pieniędzy. Kilka lat przed Komisarze kościelni planowali rozwinąć Gravel Pit Wood (obecnie Highgate Wood) jako osiedle mieszkaniowe, ale spotkało się to z tak dużym sprzeciwem, że się wycofali. Zamiast tego w 1886 roku dali publicznie wszystkie 69 akrów lasów. W tym samym czasie zaproponowali sprzedaż Churchyard Bottom Wood Radzie Miejskiej w Hornsey za 25 000 funtów, ale to było zbyt wiele, aby Hornsey mógł sam zebrać pieniądze. Rada stwierdziła, że ludzie mieszkający poza Hornsey również cieszyli się drewnem i inne władze powinny pomóc, ale nie udzielono żadnej pomocy. Ostatecznie oferta upadła.<br/><br/>Mapa pokazująca Muswell Hill Cottages, które były centrum kontrowersji.<br/><br/>Muswell Hill Road około 1880 roku<br/><br/>Wydaje się prawdopodobne, że te trzy pary domków były w centrum sporu.<br/><br/>Komisarze kościelni chcieli zebrać pieniądze na działalność kościelną w Wielkiej Brytanii i za granicą. Uważali, że otrzymali ziemię, która miała być wykorzystana do propagowania religii, a jeśli oznaczało to sprzedaż ziemi lub lasów, to było to mniejsze zło niż ograniczenie pracy kościoła. Dali publiczności Gravel Pit Wood: na jego miejscu założyliby Churchyard Bottom Wood.<br/><br/>Powiernicy organizacji charytatywnych Hornsey chcieli wygenerować dochód, aby pomóc swoim biednym ludziom, więc złożyli propozycję komisarzom. Ich trójkątny kawałek ziemi był zbyt niezręcznie ukształtowany, aby mógł być zagospodarowany ekonomicznie, ale jeśli komisarze daliby im trochę więcej ziemi, aby uczynić go kwadratowym miejscem, zbudowaliby dwadzieścia pięć schludnych willi. Przyniosłyby one czynsz w wysokości 225 funtów rocznie, który mógłby zostać wykorzystany na złagodzenie ubóstwa ludności Hornsey. W zamian pozwoliłyby Komisji na przecięcie dwóch dróg przez ich ziemię, aby komisarze mogli rozwijać lasy.<br/><br/>Kiedy ta oferta stała się znana, ludzie natychmiast zareagowali alarmem.<br/><br/>16 grudnia 1893 roku poseł Carvell Williams zapytał w Izbie Gmin, czy komisarze kościelni zgodzili się sprzedać pasek ziemi powiernikom Hornsey Charities pod warunkiem, że istniejąca droga zostanie rozszerzona do 40 stóp, czy był to wstęp do planu budowlanego i czy Izba ma możliwość wyrażenia opinii.<br/><br/>Pan Leveson Gower, komisarz ds. majątku kościelnego, odpowiedział: „Tak” na pierwszą część.<br/><br/>Pan Carvell Williams, "Czy rozumiem, że zamierzasz zniszczyć tę część Highgate Woods poprzez budowę na niej?"<br/><br/>Dwa dni później The Star opublikował artykuł godny nowoczesnego tabloidu.<br/><br/>Gwiazda<br/>18 grudnia 1893<br/><br/>"Parlament musi pilnie czuwać nad tymi starymi wandalami i konfederatami budowniczymi kościelnych komisarzy, którzy zawsze wyobcują jakiś kawałek ziemi lub faworyzują budowniczych w przeciwieństwie do ogółu społeczeństwa. Komisarze nie chcieliby sprzedawać drewna z dolnej części kościoła płatnikom stawek, ale teraz proponują "otworzenie go” poprzez przecięcie dwóch szerokich dróg w związku z jednym z ich licznych programów budowlanych. Czy ktoś nie zada pytania w Parlamencie i nie sprawdzi polityki komisarzy w zakresie cegieł i zapraw?”.<br/><br/>W chwili, gdy to zostało wydrukowane, pytanie zostało zadane, a odpowiedź była albo nieprawdziwa, albo podstępna. Inne artykuły przyjęły tę historię. The Times, w długim raporcie, powiedział, że Comnussioners nie są gotowi podjąć zobowiązanie, że Parlament, lub jakikolwiek inny organ publiczny, powinien mieć możliwość rozważenia jakiegokolwiek planu budowy na miejscu drewna.<br/><br/>Sytuacja trwała osiemnaście miesięcy, dopóki Komisarze kościelni nie zostali zmuszeni do wszczęcia dochodzenia, które rozpoczęło się w Highgate 31 maja 1895 roku, pod przewodnictwem asystenta Komisarza kościelnego. Śledztwo wywołało falę listów gazetowych, z których ten był najważniejszy.<br/><br/>The Daily Chronicle, 5 czerwca 1895<br/><br/>WANDALIZM NA WYSOKIEJ<br/><br/>Panie...<br/><br/>Zagrożony jest jeden z najpiękniejszych kawałków lasu w suburańskim Londynie. Czy pomożesz nam uniknąć nieszczęścia nie tylko w najbliższej dzielnicy, ale i w całym gęsto zaludnionym północnym Londynie? W żadnej części metropolii budowniczy nie był bardziej aktywny niż w Crouch End i Hornsey. Piękne łąki sprzed roku lub dwóch są teraz domy i sklepy. Stosy balastowe zastąpiły wspaniałe łosie i kasztany, a niegdyś przyjemne wioski dzielą los Stroud Green, Harringay, Finsbury Park, Highbury i Islington.<br/><br/>---- Obiektem jest budowa dwóch czterdziestostopowych dróg przez las. Znamy w tej dzielnicy znaczenie czterdziestostopowych dróg przez las. Oznacza to, że lasy są skazane na zagładę. Dziesięć lat temu agitacja uratowała siostrzane drewno sześćdziesięciu pięciu akrów - naturalne lasy żwirowe - i nikt, kto widział, jak tłumy Bank Holiday gromadzą się na Archway Road z żałosnych ulic Holloway, Islington i Clerkenwell, i obserwował gorącą radość dzieci i rodzinnych imprez piknikujących na trawie i wśród drzew, nie mógł zdać sobie ogromnego drewnaa. ----<br/><br/>--- Komisarze kościelni posiadają prawie jedną trzecią dużej parafii Hornsey. Poprzez liberalne wydawanie pieniędzy płacących stawkę na otwarcie dróg i ogólny rozwój powiatu, wartość ich majątku została ogromnie zwiększona, a z tego niezarobionego przyrostu czerpią one z roku na rok wielkie dochody. Z pewnością płatnicy stawek, których pieniądze w ten sposób pomogły w stworzeniu ogromnej posiadłości, mogą oczekiwać liberalnego traktowania w zamian.<br/><br/>Twoje posłuszeństwo,<br/><br/>Podpisany przez Wikariusza St James', Muswell Hill, ministra Park Chapel, Crouch End, adwokata mieszkającego w Onslow Gardens i trzech członków Rady Okręgowej.<br/><br/>To był strzał prosto przez łuki Kościelnych Komisarzy. Ich przywódcy religijni i Rada Okręgowa, wszyscy z bronią w ręku, mówią, że kościół jest zbyt bogaty i powinien być charytatywny, a nie chciwy. Włączenie tych dwóch duchownych było sprytnym posunięciem. Pamiętajcie, że było to jeszcze na szczycie kontrowersji Darwina. Darwin podzielił wiarę w nauki Kościoła i wielu ludzi oburzyłoby się na potęgę Kościoła tylko z tego punktu widzenia. Kościół nie był tak bezpieczny, jak udaje.<br/><br/>Wieczorne Wiadomości, 7 czerwca 1895 r. napisał:<br/><br/>„Jeśli nie załatwimy od razu kościelnych komnusjonistów, ośmiornica budowlana złapie drewno, które będzie bardzo trudne do późniejszego rozluźnienia. Dlatego należy londyńczycy być i zrobić, jeśli chcieliby uratować jeden z ich najpiękniejszych kawałków rustykalnych krajobrazów. Publiczne dochodzenie zostaje odroczone do czwartku, a przed tym należy zrobić coś, aby przekonać komisarzy, że obywatele Londynu nie będą tolerować konfiskaty jednego z ich ulubionych placów zabaw.<br/><br/>W liście w Daily Chronicle następnego dnia napisano:<br/><br/>..... Z wielką ulgą mieszkańcy, jakieś dziesięć lat temu, usłyszeli, że dokonano zakupu Górnego Lasu; i jak cudowne dobrodziejstwo to okazało się, każdy, kto ich odwiedził, może zeznać, ale wszyscy, którzy starali się uratować te górne lasy, które leżą po zachodniej stronie drogi Muswell Hill, czuli, że ich zwycięstwo jest niekompletne tak długo, jak sześćdziesiąg na wschodniej stronie pozostaje w niebezpieczeństwa. To jakby przypadek, że lasy dzieli szeroka wysoka droga. Czy ktoś może wątpić, jaki byłby skutek, gdyby drzewo dolnej części kościoła zostało zastąpione rzędami małych willi, z których każda wysyłała swój wkład dymu i sadzy? Czy ktokolwiek może wątpić, jak poważna byłaby różnica w malowniczym otoczeniu zakupionego lasu, gdyby linia nowych domów patrzyła prosto na ich liściaste fronty?<br/><br/>To wyraziło poglądy wielu ludzi. W rzeczywistości, Gravel Pit Wood, który pisarz nazywa "Górne Drewno", nie został zakupiony, ale podany do dzielnicy przez Komisji kościelnej, punkt, które miały być powtarzane wielokrotnie przez lata, ale większość ludzi zignorował. Komisja nie zamierzała oddawać drugiego drewna, cokolwiek ktokolwiek powiedział, i dotrzymała tego stanowiska do końca.<br/><br/>H.S.Chamberlain, z 5 Cranley Gardens, w liście do Timesa z 8 czerwca 1895 roku, wezwał do zakupu.<br/><br/>Wiem, że jest powszechne, aby mówić surowo o polach Komisarzy kościelnych, ale jako nieliczni powiernicy funduszu są zobowiązani do zarządzania nim dla największej korzyści, a zatem, jeśli coś należy zrobić, aby uratować rozbiórkę drewna, wydaje mi się, że może to być dokonane tylko przez zakup własności od Comnussioners, które znam, są w pełni żywe dla ochrony wolnej przestrzeni.<br/><br/>(Odnosi się to do Crouch End Playing Fields, które zostały zabezpieczone kilka lat później.)<br/><br/>Jako przewodniczący Stowarzyszenia Konserwatywnego Muswell Hill jestem nieustannie w kontakcie z mieszkańcami i mogę śmiało stwierdzić, że każda osoba mieszkająca w sąsiedztwie zrobiłaby wszystko, aby zachować.<br/><br/>(Osobiście pragnął jedynie dochodów charytatywnych, aby utrzymać biednych ludzi. Zażądał od nich swojego akru ziemi - na pewno niewiele - wierzył w zapewnienie komisarzy, że drewno nie jest zagrożone.)<br/><br/>Muswell Hill Road była jedną z najlepszych w Hornsey i pozostanie równie piękna, domy lub żadnych domów.<br/><br/>(A potem przyszedł wielki rozkwit retoryki.)<br/><br/>"Czy biedni mają cierpieć z powodu sentymentalnych sprzeciwów i histerycznego krzyku wilka wywołanego przez waszych korespondentów? Jeden hektar ziemi dodanej do posiadłości charytatywnej nie uczyniłby żadnej zauważalnej różnicy dla pozostałej ziemi, podczas gdy zysk z niej uzyskany pomógłby wielu biednym starym i zasługującym osobom w ich upadających latach i pozwoliłby nam przekazać naszym następcom posiadłość, która w odległej przyszłości miałaby wielką wartość w świadczeniu pomocy charytatywnej biedce parafii Hornsey.<br/><br/>Czytając jego list, człowiek czuje histerię bardzo blisko powierzchni. Dlaczego myślał, że komisarze chcą budować drogę? Dlaczego mieliby wydać wszystkie te pieniądze, jeśli nie na budowę domów? Wydawało mu się, że nigdy nie zdawał sobie sprawy, że dla jednego akru ziemi całe drewno zostanie utracone. Był osobą, której komisarze złożyli ofertę sprzedaży za 25 000 funtów przed laty i to jego imię jest honorowane na tablicy na wieży zegarowej Crouch End za ratowanie drewna, ale jego zaufanie do komisarzy kościelnych wydaje się naiwne. Smutne jest to, że podczas dochodzenia miał zostać rzucony jako diabeł.<br/><br/>Śledztwo kontynuowane<br/><br/>Przerwa została otwarta w Highgate 15 czerwca 1895 roku. W oczekiwaniu na duże zgromadzenie, Izba Rady została całkowicie zmieniona. Zwykłe stoły zostały usunięte, a sala wypełniona krzesłami. Około siódmej po południu sala była zatłoczona, a ludzie walczyli o miejsca.<br/><br/>Pan Murray, komisarz, powiedział, że dochodzenie było naprawdę proste. Hornsey Parochial Charities chciało kupić kawałek ziemi przylegający do ich własności charytatywnej z tyłu. Pytanie brzmiało, czy Komisja Charytatywna, która kontrolowała wszystkie organizacje charytatywne, miała wystarczającą moc, aby je powstrzymać. Komisarze kościelni byli gotowi sprzedać ziemię na bardzo korzystnych warunkach, a dochód Miłosierdzia znacznie wzrósł.<br/><br/>Przeciwko temu istniały trzy rodzaje sprzeciwu.<br/><br/>Pierwotny Trust miał na celu zapewnienie domków dla ubogich, ale powiernicy proponowali budowę willi, które byłyby zbyt drogie dla ubogich. Jednak w mocy Powierników było zmienianie warunków Trustu, więc mogli budować wille, jeśli uważali, że ubodzy w końcu skorzystają. Sprzeciwić się mogli sami ubodzy, ale obiecano im już liberalne przepisy. Trzeci sprzeciw dotyczył estetycznej i publicznej strony sprawy. Wziął to z tego, co przeczytał, że komisja charytatywna powinna interweniować, aby uniemożliwić komisarzom kościelnym korzystanie z własnej swobody w zajmowaniu się własną własnością.<br/><br/>W dochodzeniu omówiono drobne kwestie, ale mówcy wciąż wracali do głównego problemu zapobieżenia zniszczeniu drewna. Kleryk z Islington, reprezentujący 300 000 osób, złożył formalny protest przeciwko jakiejkolwiek części drewna, tak cennej dla mieszkańców Islington i Hornsey, wykorzystywanej do celów prywatnych. Wilfred White powiedział, że jeśli komisarze dadzą im czas, będą mogli zebrać pieniądze na rekompensatę dla powierników.<br/><br/>Beaumont powiedział, że nie chcą willi, chcą domków dla biednych ludzi, którzy zostali wypędzeni z dzielnicy. Inni mówili, że nie ma pieniędzy na budowę domków, aby zastąpić obecne zniszczone, ale wille byłyby propozycją ekonomiczną. Inni odparli, że w Highgate jest wiele willi. Las był święty. Przejdźmy do pytania o drewno.<br/><br/>Dr Fletcher powiedział, że wołaniem wśród pracowników było to, że nie ma dokąd pójść. Pracownicy przyszli do niego z wołaniem: "Jesteśmy wypędzeni z Highgate i jesteśmy zobowiązani do udania się do Highgate New Town". Jeśli front Muswell Hill Road został sprzedany, nie było wątpliwości, ale drogi mogłyby zostać przecięte przez las w kierunku Hornsey, ale jeśli komisarze nie mogliby uzyskać ziemi od Komisji Charytatywnej, nie mogliby przeciąć drogi.<br/><br/>Był bardzo pewny, że domki można umieścić w odpowiednim stanie naprawczym. Biedni ludzie, policja i szereg klas robotniczych poprosili go, aby reprezentował te dwa punkty, że w Highgate bardzo potrzebne jest zakwaterowanie w domkach i że jeśli kiedyś pozwolą sprzedać ziemię, nie będzie wiadomo, gdzie zostanie ręka budowniczego.<br/><br/>(Głośne i długotrwałe wiwatowanie).<br/><br/>Wielu innych ludzi mówiło, a Comnussioner podsumował, mówiąc, że uznał, że panująca opinia była na korzyść zatrzymania domków, ale spotkanie nie powinno wyciągać żadnych wniosków z tego, co powiedział (Groans).<br/><br/>Inni powiedzieli, że Powiernicy Miłosierdzia nie wywiązali się ze swoich obowiązków, pozwalając domkom popaść w ruinę.<br/><br/>Pan H.R. Williams, powiernik, który wcześniej napisał do gazety, powiedział, że ma najlepsze prawo, aby komisarze kościelni nie tworzyli żadnych dróg i nie skorzystali ani na jednym jocie z działań komisarzy charytatywnych. Inni byli o wiele mniej ufni i spotkanie zakończyło się po prawie trzech godzinach.<br/><br/>"Stoimy w obliczu faktu, że w Highgate i Muswell Hill jest wiele osób, które chcą Churchyard Bottom Wood i nie będą szczęśliwe, dopóki go nie dostaną - podczas gdy nikt nie wydaje się skłonny wydać grosza, aby za niego zapłacić. Wszyscy mówią, że dobrze byłoby mieć drewno jako otwartą przestrzeń, ale każdy uważa, że obowiązkiem kogoś innego jest uczynienie go jednym. Islington Vestry ma "rozwiązany" w tym temacie, ale Islington Vestry nie oferuje ani grosza na zakup. Nie ma trudniejszego problemu dla społeczności lub jednostki do rozwiązania, niż jak zdobyć własność innych ludzi bez płacenia za nią.<br/><br/>Płacenie za to było rzeczywiście problemem, ponieważ Churchyard Bottom Wood stał się przedmiotem intensywnej debaty lokalnej i narodowej. Wspólny komitet został utworzony, aby zebrać pieniądze na oszczędzanie drewna. 20 listopada 1896, C.F. Cory-Wright, honorowy skarbnik, napisał do ówczesnej gazety The Standard, apelując o pomoc. Przypomniał wszystkim o niebezpieczeństwie utraty drewna i powiedział, że można je uratować tylko kupując je. Komisarze kościelni sprzedaliby za 25 000 funtów i dodatkowy (5 000 byłoby wymagane do ogrodzenia i odwadniania, co w sumie 30 000 funtów. To było zbyt wiele dla Rady Hornseya, aby zebrać, ale już głosowali za 10 000 funtów w sumie. Lasy miały nieocenioną wartość dla całego północnego Londynu, dlatego zwrócił się do organów publicznych i osób prywatnych o zebranie pozostałych 20 000 funtów. Ostrzegł, że obecna oferta Komisarzy Kościoła była otwarta tylko do końca 1898 roku. Po tym czasie budowniczowie wprowadzą się do<br/><br/>Apel został serdecznie przyjęty przez prasę. Prywatna ustawa została szybko przeniesiona przez parlament i Highgate Woods Preservation Act, 1897, stał się prawem. Conunittee miał teraz prawo do reklamowania wkładów na zakup drewna i jego konserwacji.<br/><br/>W dość krótkim czasie prawie wszystkie pieniądze zostały zebrane, ale ostatnie kilka tysięcy okazało się bardzo trudne do zebrania, a termin dla komisarzy był kwestią kilku tygodni. Cory-Wright napisał, że prosi o więcej czasu, ale otrzymał tylko trzy miesiące, a następnie tylko wtedy, gdy odsetki w wysokości 4 procent zostały zapłacone za dodatkowy okres na pełną kwotę. Ostatecznie rada hrabstwa Londyn, która pierwotnie zaoferowała 2500 funtów, osiągnęła sumę 5000 funtów i została osiągnięta, ale była to rzecz bliska.<br/><br/>Rada postanowiła przemianować Drewno na „Drzewo Królowej” na cześć Diamentowego Jubileuszu Królowej Wiktorii, a Hornsey umieścił na pięknym pokazie buntowania, gdy księżna Albany formalnie ogłosiła Drewno otwarte „do wolnego użytku publicznego na zawsze”.<br/><br/>Podczas gdy kampania na rzecz uratowania Churchyard Bottom Wood była prowadzona i kierowana przez miejscowych ludzi, którzy pasjonowali się tym konkretnym kawałkiem lasu, wezwali oni do pomocy i doświadczenia rozległej sieci ludzi, z których niektórzy pracowali razem nad podobnymi kampaniami przez ponad trzydzieści lat. Komitet wydał apel, wydrukowany na bardzo dobrej jakości papierze i opatrzony kilkoma znanymi nazwiskami.<br/><br/>Kwestie otwartej przestrzeni i zdrowia publicznego były głównymi tematami wiktoriańskiej wizji.<br/><br/>Ruch Otwartych Przestrzeni<br/><br/>Octavia Hill, wielka reformatorka mieszkaniowa, która zaczęła od trzech starych domów w Marylebone, kupionych dla niej przez Jolma Ruskina, szybko stała się ekspertem w zakresie zakwaterowania ubogich w najzdrowszych możliwych warunkach. Jej droga polegała na zakupie najmu, a następnie zburzeniu niektórych zatłoczonych domów, aby przynieść światło i powietrze do reszty, wierząc, że świeże powietrze i światło słoneczne były jedynym sposobem na uratowanie biednych ludzi przed "gorączką". Nauczyła się tego jako dziecko od swojego dziadka, Southwooda Smitha, który rozwinął swoje teorie w szpitalu Fever w King's Cross.<br/><br/>Zbudował pierwsze mieszkania przemysłowe dla ubogich i statystycznie udowodnił, że dobre powietrze i przyzwoity drenaż uratowały życie. Gibson Gardens, w Northwold Road, jest bezpośrednim wynikiem pomysłów Southwood Smith. Więcej informacji na temat Gibson Gardens<br/><br/>Znaczenie otwartego powietrza<br/><br/>Otwarte przestrzenie i możliwość oddychania czystym powietrzem były niezbędne dla ludzi mieszkających w jednym lub dwóch zatłoczonych pokojach. Octavia Hill wziął jej opłaty od slumsów Lisson Grove, w górę Fitzjohn's Avenue do Hampstead Heath. Tak bardzo kochała pola Fitzjohn's Avenue, że próbowała je kupić jako park publiczny. Miały one kosztować 10 000 funtów i w ciągu trzech tygodni sierpnia zebrano 8 500 funtów. Potrzebny był tylko koniec letnich wakacji i powrót z wakacji sympatycznych przyjaciół, a kolejne 1500 funtów zostałoby podniesione, ale właściciele nagle wycofali swoją ofertę. Pomimo wszystkich błagań pola były pokryte dużymi domami.<br/><br/>Od tego rozwinęła się kampania na rzecz ratowania Parliament Hill, następnej otwartej przestrzeni na północ od Lisson Grove, kupując pola na drodze budowniczych, aby stworzyć stały kordon sanitarny przeciwko postępującym cegłam. Kampania Parliament Hill Fields była tak udana, że uchwalono ustawę Hampstead Heath i zebrano pieniądze z apelu. Z tych pieniędzy i impulsu do otwartych przestrzeni miało powstać National Trust. Octavia Hill była od lat zainteresowana ochroną obszarów takich jak Church Bottom Wood, więc była naturalnym sojusznikiem w walce o uratowanie Lasu.<br/><br/>The Commons Preservation Society był również zaznajomiony z tego rodzaju agitacji i zbierania pieniędzy. Zburzyli ogrodzenia, gdy panowie dworu zamknęli kawałki wspólnej ziemi, prowadząc zarówno legalne, jak i nielegalne bitwy przeciwko aroganckiej prywatyzacji ziemi tradycyjnie wolnej. Robert Hunter, ich Honorowy Solicitor od 1868 roku, zawsze zajmował się zabezpieczaniem otwartych przestrzeni, dużych lub małych, dla publiczności. On, teraz Sir Robert Hunter, został przewodniczącym Kościoła Dolnej Apelacji. Przewodniczącym Commons Preservation Society był pan Shaw-Lefevre MP (później Lord Eversley), który odegrał dużą rolę w tej i innych kampaniach w Izbie Gmin. Octavia Hill był zaangażowany w ich pracy od około 1875.<br/><br/>W tym samym czasie Octavia Hill prowadziła kampanię na rzecz ustawy o pochówku.<br/><br/>Miejskie cmentarze stały się tak zapełnione i tak poważne zagrożenie dla zdrowia, zanieczyszczając studnie, z których ludzie czerpali wodę pitną, że miejskie pochówki nie były już dozwolone. Zamiast tego na obrzeżach miasta powstały cmentarze. Jednym z nich był cmentarz Abney Park. Był wtedy ruch, aby usunąć nagrobki na krawędziach starych cmentarzy miejskich, ponownie pogrzebać ciała gdzie indziej i zamienić cmentarze w ogrody i otwarte przestrzenie, zamiast budować na nich. Ta ziemia w centrum Londynu była bardzo cenna i spekulanci chętnie ją zdobyli: nawet kwakerzy zbudowali jeden ze swoich cmentarzy i zagrozili, że zrobią to ponownie, budując nad Bunhill Fields. Octavia Hill miała sieć sojuszników na kilkunastu polach, więc jej pomoc w uratowaniu Drzewa Kościelnego musiała być bezcenna.<br/><br/>Metropolitan Gardens Society, założone w 1882 roku, rozmieściło około dwustu małych ogrodów w centrach miast do 1890 roku. Później przekazali je władzom lokalnym, więc ich poparcie dla Churchyard Bottom Wood Appeal zostało zapewnione od samego początku.<br/><br/>Towarzystwo Kyrle jest teraz zapomniane, ale w swoich czasach miało duży wpływ na planowanie miejskie i ustawodawstwo dotyczące otwartej przestrzeni. Towarzystwo zostało założone około 1875 roku w celu „Rozprzestrzeniania się piękna”, aby wnieść kolor i zainteresowanie w życie ludzi żyjących w matowym, ciemnym otoczeniu. Jasny kolor ścian i dekoracji, dobry śpiew, otwarte przestrzenie, Natura, Literatura i Sztuka. Był tam oddział dekoracyjny, dla którego wykładał William Morris; oddział muzyczny promujący chóry i Happy Evenings dla ludzi w lokalnych budynkach szkolnych; oraz oddział literatury. Towarzystwo regularnie apelowało w listach w The Times, do "bogatszych klas" książek i czasopism, które mają być rozpowszechniane do klubów chłopców i dziewcząt, jałmużn i gdzie indziej. Jednak Komitet Otwartych Przestrzeni był najbardziej aktywny. Sama nazwa „Kyrle” pochodzi od Papieża „Człowiek Rossa”, filantropa, który dał swoje miejsce narodzin ludziom jako park publiczny. |
| With Thanksgiving around the corner, here are some festive file folder games we made for the girls. Both Thanksgiving games focus on math skills. And I'm grateful once again to my husband, Ed, for making all the clipart for me.<br/><br/>Thanksgiving Pattern Making<br/><br/>Like the name says, this game is about making patterns. Little ones just learning about patterns, can simply match the pictures onto the pattern strips, while others can continue the pattern with the picture cards on the blank strips.<br/><br/>To make the file folder, you want to cut out the grid of pictures to make the card pieces. I recommend laminating them to help them last longer. Then glue the pattern strips down on the file folder.<br/><br/>I wanted to have the blank pattern strips too so that the girls could see where to continue the pattern and how many to lay out. I attached them to the side of the folder using tape so that they could fold in to pack up the game and extend to layout the pattern.<br/><br/>I also added an extra blank one so that the girls could make their own pattern as well.<br/><br/>Turkey Number Game<br/><br/>In this game the girls add the feathers to the turkey body while practicing counting and number recognition. I used the colorless feathers to act as a guide for where to add the feathers and so that the girls could match the numbers. And be sure when gluing down the turkey body you only glue in the center so that the wing pieces can slide under the body.<br/><br/>Once all the feathers are laid out, we practice some simple arithmetic, such as taking away three feathers and seeing how many are left then adding two back to see what it equals.<br/><br/>In addition to black and white wings, we also included a colorless turkey in case you want to have the little ones color their own set. Instead of a file folder game you can turn this into a craft, coloring the pieces, cutting them out, and gluing them together.<br/><br/>Another option is to use the pieces to make a felt board story. We sometimes sing a turkey version of 10 Little Indians:<br/><br/>Like this:<br/><br/>Who Am I?<br/><br/>I think this is where I'm suppose to say something witty about myself. Oh well. I'm a stay-at-home mom to three awesome kids--our twin daughters who are seven now and a two-year-old son who is full of energy. In my pre-children life I was a teacher and I now homeschool our children. I'm also married to Ed, who is currently serving in the Air Force, and is the love of my life (it'd be awkward if he wasn't). Our family is big on books, crafts, and having fun together. I just thought I would share our activities in my own little corner of the internet.<br/><br/>Zoe appears to have it all--rich, handsome husband, easy New York life--but she made mistakes in her past and those mistakes are coming back up in her new life. I found myself on the edge of my seat for most of the book and was surprised...<br/><br/>I loved this book, I love the story, and I am grateful Margot Shetterly brought it to light. My only complaint was that I wished she discussed Katherine Johnson's role in the later missions a bit more but I guess the story had to end som...<br/><br/>I wanted to like this book and I did throughout most of it.

Obie gry z okazji Święta Dziękczynienia koncentrują się na umiejętnościach matematycznych. I jestem jeszcze raz wdzięczna mojemu mężowi, Edowi, za zrobienie dla mnie wszystkich klipartów.<br/><br/>Święto Dziękczynienia Wzór Making<br/><br/>Jak sama nazwa wskazuje, w tej grze chodzi o tworzenie wzorów. Małe dzieci, które dopiero uczą się o wzorach, mogą po prostu dopasować zdjęcia na paski wzorów, podczas gdy inni mogą kontynuować wzór z kartami z obrazkami na pustych paskach.<br/><br/>Aby utworzyć folder plików, chcesz wyciąć siatkę obrazów, aby zrobić kawałki karty. Polecam laminowanie ich, aby pomóc im dłużej. Następnie przyklej paski wzoru w dół na folderze pliku.<br/><br/>Chciałem mieć również puste paski, aby dziewczyny mogły zobaczyć, gdzie kontynuować wzór i ile rozłożyć. Przymocowałem je do boku folderu za pomocą taśmy, aby mogły się złożyć, aby zapakować grę i rozszerzyć układ wzoru.<br/><br/>Dodałem również dodatkową pustą, aby dziewczyny mogły również tworzyć własny wzór.<br/><br/>Turcja numer gry<br/><br/>W tej grze dziewczęta dodają pióra do ciała indyka podczas ćwiczeń liczenia i rozpoznawania liczb. Użyłem bezbarwnych piór, aby działać jako przewodnik, gdzie dodać pióra i tak, że dziewczyny mogły dopasować liczby. I upewnij się, że podczas klejenia ciała indyka przyklejasz tylko w środku, aby kawałki skrzydeł mogły przesuwać się pod ciałem.<br/><br/>Gdy wszystkie pióra są rozłożone, ćwiczymy prostą arytmetykę, na przykład zabieramy trzy pióra i widzimy, ile pozostało, a następnie dodajemy dwa, aby zobaczyć, co jest równe.<br/><br/>Oprócz czarno-białych skrzydeł, dołączyliśmy również bezbarwny indyk na wypadek, gdybyś chciał, aby maluchy miały własny zestaw kolorów. Zamiast gry z folderami plików możesz zamienić to w rzemiosło, kolorując kawałki, wycinając je i klejąc je razem.<br/><br/>Inną opcją jest użycie kawałków, aby stworzyć historię płyty filcowej. Czasami śpiewamy indyczą wersję 10 Little Indians:<br/><br/>Podoba mi się to:<br/><br/>Kim ja jestem?<br/><br/>Myślę, że to jest miejsce, w którym powinnam powiedzieć coś dowcipnego o sobie. Jestem mamą w domu dla trójki wspaniałych dzieci - naszych bliźniaczych córek, które mają teraz siedem lat i dwuletniego syna, który jest pełen energii. W życiu przedszkolnym byłam nauczycielką, a teraz uczę nasze dzieci w domu. Jestem również żoną Eda, który obecnie służy w Siłach Powietrznych i jest miłością mojego życia (byłoby niezręcznie, gdyby nie on). Nasza rodzina jest duża w książkach, rzemiośle i wspólnej zabawie. Pomyślałem, że podzielę się naszymi działaniami w moim małym zakątku Internetu.<br/><br/>Zoe wydaje się mieć wszystko - bogaty, przystojny mąż, łatwe życie w Nowym Jorku - ale popełniła błędy w przeszłości i te błędy powracają w jej nowym życiu. Znalazłam się na krawędzi mojego fotela przez większość książki i byłam zaskoczona...<br/><br/>Uwielbiałam tę książkę, uwielbiam tę historię i jestem wdzięczna, że Margot Shetterly wydobyła ją na światło dzienne. Moją jedyną skargą było to, że chciałam, aby omawiała rolę Katherine Johnson w późniejszych misjach nieco bardziej, ale myślę, że historia musiała się zakończyć...<br/><br/>Chciałem lubić tę książkę i zrobiłem przez większość czasu. Dana dowiaduje się, że jej odłączony mąż i jego dziewczyna są znalezieni martwi na pustyni w Nowym Meksyku. Od razu przyciągnęła mnie jej postać i historia. Naprawdę podobało mi się to, że... |
| Alcohol use by persons under age 21 has been identified as a major public health problem. Studies note that it increases the risks for disability, and may be detrimental to the developing brain. Minors who drink are more likely to commit suicide, break the law, or be victims of violence. Alcohol is implicated in nearly one-third of youth traffic fatalities. The total annual cost of underage drinking is estimated at $62 billion. While most laws intended to prevent underage drinking are passed at the state level, there has been legislative activity and interest at the federal level to support states' efforts to curb the problem. This report describes the extent of underage alcohol use, recent legislative activity on this issue, and various policy implications. It will be updated as new data become available. | Zażywanie alkoholu przez osoby poniżej 21 roku życia zostało zidentyfikowane jako poważny problem zdrowia publicznego. Badania zauważają, że zwiększa ryzyko niepełnosprawności i może być szkodliwe dla rozwijającego się mózgu. Nieletni, którzy piją, częściej popełniają samobójstwa, łamią prawo lub są ofiarami przemocy. Alkohol jest zaangażowany w prawie jedną trzecią śmiertelnych wypadków drogowych wśród młodzieży. Całkowity roczny koszt picia nieletnich szacuje się na 62 miliardy dolarów. Podczas gdy większość przepisów mających na celu zapobieganie piciu alkoholu przez nieletnich została uchwalona na poziomie stanowym, na poziomie federalnym istnieje aktywność legislacyjna i zainteresowanie wspieraniem wysiłków stanowych w celu ograniczenia problemu. W sprawozdaniu tym opisano zakres spożycia alkoholu przez nieletnich, ostatnie działania legislacyjne w tej sprawie oraz różne implikacje polityczne. Raport zostanie zaktualizowany wraz z pojawieniem się nowych danych. |
| Tag Archives: real food<br/><br/>Last week I wrote about the Nordic Food Manifesto, and how Denmark created a strong "real food" culture largely from an intentional effort led by Claus Meyer. It wasn't political lobbying or public petitioning that resulted in food reform, but rather a grassroots effort led by citizens with the power to actually implement and follow-through with change.<br/><br/>I ended the post alluding to one question: Why is it so hard for us to do this ourselves, as individuals? If an entire country can implement and spread a common view towards food, why can't we?<br/><br/>There's nothing really stopping us from mimicking Denmark's success. The problem is, we're inundated with so many messages about what we should be eating, and how we should be living, it's hard to know where to start. So rather than following successful frameworks that have been shown to work (like the Nordic Food Manifesto), most people jump from diet craze to diet craze, trying to find the "right way to eat."<br/><br/>But how did Claus Meyer succeed? What was the secret sauce that helped the Manifesto take hold? And is it reasonable to think we can apply those lessons to our own lives?

To nie lobbing polityczny czy publiczne petycje doprowadziły do reformy żywnościowej, ale raczej wysiłek oddolny prowadzony przez obywateli z mocą faktycznego wdrożenia i kontynuowania zmian.<br/><br/>Zakończyłem post nawiązując do jednego pytania: Dlaczego tak trudno jest nam to zrobić sami, jako jednostkom? Jeśli cały kraj może wdrożyć i rozpowszechnić wspólny pogląd na jedzenie, dlaczego my nie możemy?<br/><br/>Nic tak naprawdę nie powstrzymuje nas przed naśladowaniem sukcesu Danii.
