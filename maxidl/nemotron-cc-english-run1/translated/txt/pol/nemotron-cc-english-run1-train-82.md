In simple terms, the condition is characterized by: one develops a kidney disease and undergoes a kidney transplant and other diseases associated with acidic concentration in the blood and gout. In theory, the condition will occur even if the genetic change is inherited from one parent and sporadically occurs when there is no family history.<br/><br/>Common names of autosomal dominant interstitial kidney disease<br/><br/>The condition has other names as well namely: medullary cystic kidney disease, although this name is not used as much because most people suffering from this condition do not have medullary cysts. It is also referred to as juvenile hyperuricemic nephropathy. The disease tends to affect people of ages 20 to 50. The latter condition as aforementioned occurs in young children, something, which translate to get it from both parents.<br/>Cystic kidney disease is an inherited condition whereby the cysts in the centre of each kidney gradually lose their ability to function properly. Cysts refer to abnormal blisters of fluid in the kidney. The condition further scares the kidney making unable to concentrate the urine and as a result, producing too much urine. Its symptoms include excessive urination, salt cravings, weakness, confusion, bleeding, fatigue, frequent hiccups, low blood pressure, nausea and vomiting, headaches, pale skin, reduced sensation in the hands, weight loss among many others. Other complications include: anemia, ulcers, loss of bone density, infertility and other heart related problems.<br/>Its analysis incorporates blood tests to check for sodium levels and general kidney functions, urine tests to check the levels of concentration and other imbalances, x rays to check for the size of kidneys that may be altered owing to increased urine concentrations, renal biopsy and genetic testing to verify any genetic changes that might have taken place in due time.<br/>While the disease does not have a cut and dry treatment to it, one may focus on controlling measures, which include intake of fluids and salt to supplement the one lost as the disease progresses into latter stages. This also helps reduce dehydration. Other treatments include taking of prescribed medication and diet changes and minimal intakes of foods containing phosphorous and potassium. Further complications may also require one to have a kidney transplant. Basically, this is not a curable disease but rather a manageable once detected in the early stages.<br/><br/>The common yet different factor of Autosomal dominant interstitial kidney disease<br/><br/>Nephronophthisis and medullary cystic kidney disease are mainly grouped together because, in essence, they share the same features but with a slight difference in regards inheritance patterns to the former affecting children and the latter affecting young adults and older age groups. Similar features for both are ADH resistant urine concentration that leads to polyuria and polydipsia, anemia and renal diseases.<br/>The former aforementioned condition is Autosomal recessive accounting to 15% of chronic diseases and causes ESRD during early childhood while the latter is Autosomal dominant with a few sporadic new mutations and causes ESRD for people between the ages of 30 and 50. | Blog o certyfikacji CPR online<br/><br/>Data: 23 lipca 2014<br/><br/>Autosomalna dominująca śródmiąższowa choroba nerek jest rzadką grupą chorób wpływających na znane funkcje nerek. Mówiąc prościej, stan charakteryzuje się: rozwija się choroba nerek i przechodzi przeszczep nerki i inne choroby związane z kwaśnym stężeniem we krwi i dny moczanowej. Teoretycznie warunek wystąpi nawet jeśli zmiana genetyczna jest dziedziczona od jednego rodzica i sporadycznie występuje, gdy nie ma historii rodzinnej.<br/><br/>Wspólne nazwy autosomalnie dominującej choroby śródmiąższowej nerek<br/><br/>Stan ma również inne nazwy, a mianowicie: rdzeniowa torbielowata choroba nerek, chociaż nazwa ta nie jest używana tak często, ponieważ większość osób cierpiących na tę chorobę nie ma torbieli rdzeniowych. Nazywana jest również młodzieńczym nefropatią hiperuricemiczną. Choroba ma tendencję do dotykania osób w wieku od 20 do 50 lat. Ten ostatni stan, jak wspomniano powyżej, występuje u małych dzieci, co przekłada się na uzyskanie go od obojga rodziców.<br/>Cystyczna choroba nerek jest dziedzicznym stanem, w którym torbiele w centrum każdej nerki stopniowo tracą zdolność do prawidłowego funkcjonowania. Cysty odnoszą się do nieprawidłowych pęcherzy płynu w nerkach. Ten stan dodatkowo przeraża nerki, co uniemożliwia koncentrację moczu i w rezultacie produkuje zbyt dużo moczu. Jego objawy obejmują nadmierne oddawanie moczu, łaknienie soli, osłabienie, splątanie, krwawienie, zmęczenie, częste czkawki, niskie ciśnienie krwi, nudności i wymioty, bóle głowy, bladość skóry, zmniejszone uczucie w dłoniach, utratę wagi wśród wielu innych.

| Hobbes' vs. Locke's Account on the State of Nature<br/><br/>Topic: PhilosophyWords: 2539Pages: 9Aug 3rd, 2021<br/><br/>Hobbes and Locke are among the most influential political philosophers to ever write in English. The state of nature, which precedes the organization of the complex societies, is the common premise that both Hobbes and Locke share but interpret in different ways. The former views humans in their natural state as equally dangerous and free to pursue their egoistic goals unrestricted by the nonexistent notions of justice, which is why his natural state amounts to the "war of every man against every man" (Hobbes76). The latter, on the other hand, views humans in their original condition as equally valuable and restricts natural freedom by the idea of justice that requires not to harm others, which allows defining the state of nature as "mutual assistance and preservation" rather than war (Locke 15). The key difference between the two philosophers' accounts of natural state is that Locke uses ethical considerations while Hobbes does not, and it ultimately leads Hobbes to envisage a state exercising unlimited power over human beings, while Locke limits the government by the moral principles, which he considers a natural law.<br/><br/>Hobbes bases his assumptions regarding the state of nature on the fact that all people are roughly equal in their physical and mental capabilities. He admits that some individuals may demonstrate greater physical strength or superior intellect but insists that "when all is reckoned together, the difference between man and man is not so considerable" (Hobbes 74). Since humans are roughly equal in their capabilities, they also have similar hopes to attain their ends and satisfy their needs (Hobbes 75). As a logical outcome of this equality, when the people begin competing for scarce resources, no one may feel entirely secure in his or her possessions. Even if a mighty, cunning, and capable person succeeds in subjugating "the persons of all men he can," it still does not guarantee the ultimate security (Hobbes 75). As no human can obtain such superiority over the others that renders him or her utterly immune to their strength of intellect, no human can feel completely safe when surrounded by his or her equals. Hobbes' equality in the natural state is equality of fear, where all humans view each other as dangerous competitors.<br/><br/>Just as Hobbes, Locke considers all human beings to be fundamentally equal, but assigns a very different meaning to the term. From his perspective, it is not the equality of capabilities, but, rather, the equality of value. He opines that the people "promiscuously born to all the same advantages of nature" should logically enjoy the perfect equality among them, as there is no reason to consider anyone inherently more valuable (Locke 8). The only possible foundation for designating some people as superior to others would be if God "by any manifest declaration of his will, set one above another" (Locke 8). Since such divine sanction of superiority is absent, Locke concludes that the natural equality of all representatives of humankind is not to be called into question. Hobbes approaches equality pragmatically and stresses that people in their natural state are equally dangerous, but Locke employs an ethical approach and emphasizes that humans are equally valuable in God's eyes. This disagreement is but the first difference between the two authors based on the fact that Locke includes God as a premise into his political philosophy, while Hobbes does not.<br/><br/>Another characteristic feature of Hobbes' account of the natural state is his interpretation of liberty. According to Hobbes, the state of nature implies unlimited freedom to do whatever is necessary for one's continued existence. The philosopher defines liberty as "the absence of external impediments" in using one's abilities to attain one's goals (Hobbes 79). The primary purpose of every sentient being is to maintain its continued existence. As a consequence, Hobbesian freedom amounts to the unhindered opportunity to do anything that, in one's judgment, would be best suited to preserve one's life and possessions (Hobbes 79). The only limitation to liberty is that a person cannot do anything contradictory to sustaining his or her life or destroying "the means of preserving the same" (Hobbes 79). Apart from that, there are no boundaries, and everyone has "a right to everything, even to one another's body" if that furthers one's survival (Hobbes 80). Thus, natural liberty, as viewed by Hobbes, is the absence of externally enforced obstacles in pursuing one's right to everything to sustain and secure one's continued existence.<br/><br/>Locke also upholds the idea of natural liberty but, unsurprisingly, approaches it in a manner that is significantly different from that of Hobbes. As soon as he begins discussing liberty in the state of nature, he immediately notes that a state of freedom does not equate "a state of license" (Locke 9). The philosopher identifies two specific limitations to human freedom in the state of nature. The first one is identical to that introduce by Hobbes: however free and independent, a person nevertheless "has not liberty to destroy himself" (Locke 9). Yet the second limitation contradicts Hobbes' prepositions directly. According to Locke, every human being has a natural obligation not to "harm another in his life, health, liberty, or possessions" (9). Just as with his interpretation of equality, the author bases this assertion on ethical and religious grounds: people should preserve each other's existence since they are all creations of the same "omnipotent, and infinitely wise maker" (Locke 9). Thus, Locke's limits liberty in the natural state far more stringently than Hobbes by introducing the obligation to refrain from harming both oneself and the others.<br/><br/>The differences between the two authors also manifest in their accounts of justice in the natural state of humanity. As far as Hobbes is concerned, delineating just and unjust practices is merely the matter of the law. There is no jurisprudence in the state of nature, and the only law governing human beings in their original condition is a natural law that only obliges them to seek personal security. As a result, nothing can be unjust in the original state of the humankind: "notions of right and wrong justice and injustice" have no place and no meaning in the absence of the stringently enforced law (Hobbes 78). As long as the people use their virtually unlimited freedom to ruthlessly compete with each other for resources, to which they are equally entitled, they have no criteria to differentiate between just and unjust actions. Therefore, the Hobbesian state of nature defies the very idea of justice since the author interprets it as a mere function of the formalized and established law.<br/><br/>Locke assigns different meaning to justice and views it not so much in legislative as in the ethical terms. This paper already mentioned that, unlike Hobbes, Locke employs ethical notions and generally bases his political philosophy on moral rather than purely practical presumptions. Locke's natural law, unlike that of Hobbes, obliges human beings to take care of each other rather than simply leaving everyone to fend for themselves. As a result, there is a place for justice and injustice in his state of nature. The author points to this fact himself when noting that no one should deprive another of his or her life of the means of preserving it "unless it be to do justice on an offender" (Locke 9). This statement reveals with the utmost clarity that, according to Locke, there is justice in the state of nature, and, moreover, humans have to preserve it actively. The criterion of justice, which Hobbes' natural state lacks, is the second limitation on natural liberty imposed by Locke: an action is unjust if it constitutes an unwarranted threat to another person's life and possessions.<br/><br/>These differences in the two authors' treatment of equality, liberty, and justice or injustice culminate in their interpretation of the relationship between the state of nature and the state of war. From Hobbes's perspective, the two are synonymous, because the ruthless competition is the only logical outcome of putting people with equivalent capabilities and similar needs in an environment with limited resources. He states this connection outright: "if any two men desire the same thing, which nevertheless they cannot both enjoy, they become enemies" and are, therefore, in the state of war with each other (Hobbes 75). Yet since humans are numerous and all possess similar capabilities and needs, this competition manifests not only in the individual interactions but also on the level of humanity as a whole. As long as all humans have equal and unlimited rights to all resources and even to each other's bodies and lives, the state of nature is a war of "every man against every man" (Hobbes 76). This grim interpretation stems directly from Hobbes' portrayal of the state of nature as governed solely by the individuals' egoistic urges.<br/><br/>Locke, on the other hand, differentiates between the state of nature and the state of war and points out that, while they may occur simultaneously, it is no reason to identify one with the other. Locke's definition of the state of war is virtually identical to that offered by Hobbes. According to Locke, "he who attempts to get another man into his absolute power does thereby put himself into a state of war with him" (14). This explanation lines up perfectly with the Hobbesian notion that everyone's universal right to everything, including the other people's bodies and lives, leads to the state of war. Yet Locke refuses to equate the state of war and the state of nature precisely because he denies Hobbes' interpretation of natural freedom. Since Locke's natural state restrains people from harming each other through the second limitation of liberty, an attempt on another person's freedom is a transgression against the natural law. While for Hobbes, war is the humankind's condition by default, Locke portrays it as a perversion of the state of nature rather than its rule.<br/><br/>These differences in delineating the state on nature and its constituents, such as liberty, equality, justice, and war, pave the way to the authors contrasting portrayals of government. Based on his pessimistic assessment of the state of nature, the author of Leviathan concludes that, under conditions of war, there can be no definite hope for "living out the time which nature ordinarily alloweth men to live" (Hobbes 80). The solution is laying down the universal right to everything and leaving everyone "so much liberty against other men, as he would allow other men against himself" (Hobbes 80). The participants of the resulting social contract invest the unlimited liberties they have surrendered into a sovereign – the bearer of the supreme power whose purpose is to preserve the achieved status quo by punishing all transgressions against it. Sovereign's power is absolute: the ruler has the authority "to do whatsoever he shall think necessary" to promote peace between his subjects so that no one would assail another's life or property (113). Hobbes concludes that without such an unassailable figure entitled with the right to do anything to the subjects, there can be no peace and no guarantee of security.<br/><br/>While Locke agrees with the necessity of creating politically organized societies, he nevertheless opposes Hobbes' idea of the sovereign power as unlimited and unassailable. As mentioned above, Locke's state of nature is not nearly as dreadful as that painted by Hobbes because of the people's obligation to preserve not only themselves but each other as well. Therefore, the need for social contract arises not from the fear of the others, but from the sheer convenience. Small communities may not need numerous laws to solve conflicts and "officers to superintend the process," but larger associations find it advisable to institute governments for that purpose (Locke 57). Yet the power of the government cannot be unlimited because it would result in subduing the subjects to an "inconstant, uncertain, unknown, arbitrary will of another man" (Locke 17). Such a government would constitute a twofold violation of the natural law. By agreeing to another person's absolute power over his life, a subject would violate its first limitation prohibiting to harm oneself. As for the ruler, destroying another person's liberty would constitute direct harm and, as such, be contradictory to the second limitation.<br/><br/>As a direct continuation of his case for unlimited governmental authority, Hobbes denies the separation of powers as a principle. From his perspective, the sovereign, once instituted, possesses "the whole power of prescribing the rules" governing the lives of the subjects or, in shorter terms, the legislative power (Hobbes 114). The sovereign also reserves the right of "hearing and deciding all controversies" – that is, the judicial power (Hobbes 114). Finally, since the entire purpose of the sovereign is to force the subjects to refrain from harming each other, there can be no doubt that executive power is also his or her exclusive prerogative. The separation of powers as a concept is alien to Hobbes because of his views on the state of nature. Creating a political entity where the executive, legislative, and judicial branches would check each other – that is, compete – would mean recreating the Hobbesian state of nature-as-war on a higher level. Since the people enter a social contract and institute a government to put the state of nature behind them, not reinstate it in a different form, the separation of powers contradictory Hobbes' views directly.<br/><br/>Locke, on the other hand, embraces separation of power as a foundational principle of his political theory. His case for the separation is evident in the discussion of the limits of the legislative power. As Locke puts it, it would be hardly advisable "for the same persons, who have the power of making laws, to have also in their hands the power to execute them" (76). The philosopher points to the imperfections of human nature and the inherent desire to "grasp at power" as a rationale for this precautionary measure (Locke 76). Just as in Hobbes' case, Locke's account of the separation of powers stems directly from his interpretation of the state of nature. If there is already justice in the state of nature and the people can understand it, any government is inevitably subject to the same natural law. Since absolute power over people violates both limitations of this law, separating and distributing it is advisable so that the government would function appropriately.<br/><br/>This paper has demonstrated that, while the differences between Hobbes' and Locke's accounts of the natural state of humanity are numerous, they ultimately amount to the presence of absence of moral premises. Hobbes views the natural state as that of unlimited liberty, where people endowed with equal capabilities and not bound by any moral notions, such as justice, compete for the resources unceasingly. Locke, however, interprets equality and liberty ethically rather than practically and opines that war is a perversion of the natural state, as the natural law obliges humans not to harm each other. This disagreement influences the philosophers' approaches to government. Hobbes insists on an all-powerful ruler, as, in the absence of ethical restraints, no other authority could force the humans to refrain from harming each other. Yet, in Locke's view, granting the government unlimited powers would be contradictory to the ethical limitations embedded in the law of nature, which is why he, unlike Hobbes, advocates separation of powers. | Konto Hobbesa vs. Locke'a o stanie natury<br/><br/>Temat: FilozofiaSłowa: 2539Strony: 9sierpień 3rd, 2021<br/><br/>Hobbes i Locke są jednymi z najbardziej wpływowych filozofów politycznych, którzy kiedykolwiek pisali po angielsku. Stan natury, który poprzedza organizację złożonych społeczeństw, jest powszechnym założeniem, że zarówno Hobbes, jak i Locke dzielą, ale interpretują w różny sposób. Pierwszy postrzega ludzi w ich naturalnym stanie jako równie niebezpiecznych i swobodnych w dążeniu do swoich egoistycznych celów, nieograniczonych przez nieistniejące pojęcia sprawiedliwości, dlatego jego naturalny stan równa się "wojnie każdego człowieka przeciwko każdemu człowiekowi" (Hobbes 76). Ten ostatni, z drugiej strony, postrzega ludzi w ich pierwotnym stanie jako równie wartościowych i ogranicza naturalną wolność przez ideę sprawiedliwości, która wymaga, aby nie szkodzić innym, co pozwala na określenie stanu natury jako "wzajemnej pomocy i ochrony", a nie wojny (Locke 15). Kluczową różnicą między tymi dwoma filozofami jest to, że Locke używa względów etycznych, podczas gdy Hobbes tego nie robi, i ostatecznie prowadzi Hobbesa do wyobrażenia sobie państwa sprawującego nieograniczoną władzę nad ludźmi, podczas gdy Locke ogranicza rząd przez zasady moralne, które uważa za prawo naturalne.<br/><br/>Hobbes opiera swoje założenia dotyczące stanu natury na fakcie, że wszyscy ludzie są w przybliżeniu równi pod względem swoich możliwości fizycznych i psychicznych. Przyznaje, że niektóre jednostki mogą wykazywać większą siłę fizyczną lub wyższy intelekt, ale nalega, że "gdy wszystko jest liczone razem, różnica między człowiekiem a człowiekiem nie jest tak znaczna" (Hobbes 74). Ponieważ ludzie są w przybliżeniu równi w swoich zdolnościach, mają również podobne nadzieje na osiągnięcie swoich celów i zaspokojenie swoich potrzeb (Hobbes 75). Jako logiczny wynik tej równości, kiedy ludzie zaczynają konkurować o ograniczone zasoby, nikt nie może czuć się całkowicie bezpieczny w swoim majątku. Nawet jeśli potężny, przebiegły i zdolny człowiek zdoła podporządkować sobie „osoby wszystkich ludzi, których może”, to jednak nie gwarantuje ostatecznego bezpieczeństwa (Hobbes 75). Ponieważ żaden człowiek nie może osiągnąć takiej wyższości nad innymi, która czyni go całkowicie odpornym na ich siłę intelektu, żaden człowiek nie może czuć się całkowicie bezpieczny, gdy jest otoczony przez swoich równych. Równość Hobbesa w stanie naturalnym jest równością strachu, gdzie wszyscy ludzie postrzegają siebie jako niebezpiecznych konkurentów.<br/><br/>Podobnie jak Hobbes, Locke uważa, że wszyscy ludzie są zasadniczo równi, ale przypisuje temu terminowi zupełnie inne znaczenie. Z jego punktu widzenia nie jest to równość zdolności, ale raczej równość wartości. Uważa on, że ludzie „zrodzeni z tych samych zalet natury” powinni logicznie cieszyć się doskonałą równością między nimi, ponieważ nie ma powodu, by uważać kogoś z natury za bardziej wartościowego (Locke 8). Jedyną możliwą podstawą do uznania niektórych ludzi za wyższych od innych byłoby to, gdyby Bóg „przez jawne oświadczenie swej woli ustanowił jeden ponad drugim” (Locke 8). Ponieważ takie boskie zatwierdzenie wyższości jest nieobecne, Locke dochodzi do wniosku, że naturalna równość wszystkich przedstawicieli ludzkości nie powinna być kwestionowana. Hobbes podchodzi do równości pragmatycznie i podkreśla, że ludzie w ich naturalnym stanie są równie niebezpieczni, ale Locke stosuje podejście etyczne i podkreśla, że ludzie są równie cenni w oczach Boga. Ta niezgoda jest tylko pierwszą różnicą między dwoma autorami w oparciu o fakt, że Locke włącza Boga jako założenie w jego filozofii politycznej, podczas gdy Hobbes nie.<br/><br/>Inną charakterystyczną cechą opowiadania Hobbesa o stanie naturalnym jest jego interpretacja wolności. Według Hobbesa stan natury oznacza nieograniczoną swobodę robienia wszystkiego, co jest konieczne do dalszego istnienia. Filozof definiuje wolność jako „brak zewnętrznych przeszkód” w korzystaniu ze swoich zdolności do osiągnięcia swoich celów (Hobbes 79). Podstawowym celem każdej czującej istoty jest utrzymanie jej dalszego istnienia. W rezultacie, hobbesowski wolność równa się nieskrępowanej możliwości zrobić wszystko, co, w swojej ocenie, byłoby najlepiej nadaje się do zachowania życia i majątku (Hobbes 79). Jedynym ograniczeniem wolności jest to, że człowiek nie może czynić niczego sprzecznego z utrzymaniem swojego życia lub niszczeniem „środków jego zachowania” (Hobbes 79). Poza tym nie ma granic i każdy ma „prawo do wszystkiego, nawet do ciała drugiego”, jeśli to przyczynia się do jego przetrwania (Hobbes 80). Tak więc naturalna wolność, postrzegana przez Hobbesa, jest brakiem zewnętrznych przeszkód w dążeniu do prawa do wszystkiego, aby utrzymać i zapewnić sobie dalsze istnienie.<br/><br/>Locke również popiera ideę naturalnej wolności, ale, co nie dziwi, podchodzi do niej w sposób znacząco różny od Hobbesa. Jak tylko zaczyna omawiać wolność w stanie natury, natychmiast zauważa, że stan wolności nie jest równy "stanowi licencji" (Locke 9). Filozof identyfikuje dwa specyficzne ograniczenia wolności człowieka w stanie natury. Pierwszy z nich jest identyczny z tym, który wprowadził Hobbes: jakkolwiek wolny i niezależny, człowiek „nie ma swobody, by się zniszczyć” (Locke 9). Jednak drugie ograniczenie jest wprost sprzeczne z przyimkami Hobbesa. Zgodnie z Locke, każda istota ludzka ma naturalny obowiązek, aby "nie szkodzić innym w jego życiu, zdrowie, wolność, lub majątek" (9). Podobnie jak w swojej interpretacji równości, autor opiera to twierdzenie na podstawach etycznych i religijnych: ludzie powinni zachować egzystencję siebie nawzajem, ponieważ wszyscy są stworzeniami tego samego "wszechmocnego i nieskończenie mądrego twórcy" (Locke 9). Tak więc, Locke's ogranicza wolność w stanie naturalnym znacznie bardziej rygorystycznie niż Hobbes poprzez wprowadzenie obowiązku powstrzymania się od krzywdzenia zarówno siebie, jak i innych.<br/><br/>Różnice między dwoma autorami przejawiają się również w ich relacjach o sprawiedliwości w naturalnym stanie ludzkości. Jeśli chodzi o Hobbesa, nakreślenie sprawiedliwych i niesprawiedliwych praktyk jest tylko kwestią prawa. W stanie natury nie ma orzecznictwa, a jedynym prawem regulującym człowieka w jego pierwotnym stanie jest prawo naturalne, które zobowiązuje go jedynie do poszukiwania bezpieczeństwa osobistego. W rezultacie nic nie może być niesprawiedliwe w pierwotnym stanie ludzkości: „pojęcia sprawiedliwości i niesprawiedliwości” nie mają miejsca i znaczenia w braku ściśle obowiązującego prawa (KKK 78). Dopóki ludzie korzystają ze swojej praktycznie nieograniczonej wolności do bezwzględnej rywalizacji ze sobą o zasoby, do których mają równe prawo, nie mają kryteriów rozróżniających sprawiedliwe i niesprawiedliwe działania. Dlatego też hobbesowski stan natury sprzeciwia się samej idei sprawiedliwości, ponieważ autor interpretuje ją jako zwykłą funkcję sformalizowanego i ustalonego prawa.<br/><br/>Locke przypisuje sprawiedliwości różne znaczenie i postrzega ją nie tyle w kategoriach legislacyjnych, co etycznych. W tym artykule już wspomniano, że w przeciwieństwie do Hobbes, Locke zatrudnia pojęć etycznych i ogólnie opiera swoją filozofię polityczną na moralnych, a nie czysto praktycznych założeń. Prawo naturalne Locke'a, w przeciwieństwie do prawa Hobbesa, zobowiązuje ludzi do dbania o siebie nawzajem, a nie po prostu pozostawiając wszystkich, aby sami się o siebie troszczyli. W rezultacie w jego stanie natury jest miejsce na sprawiedliwość i niesprawiedliwość. Autor sam wskazuje na ten fakt, zauważając, że nikt nie powinien pozbawiać drugiego życia środków do jego zachowania, „chyba że chodzi o sprawiedliwość wobec sprawcy” (Locke 9). Oświadczenie to ujawnia z największą jasnością, że według Locke'a istnieje sprawiedliwość w stanie natury, a ponadto ludzie muszą ją aktywnie chronić. Kryterium sprawiedliwości, którego brak Hobbesowi w stanie naturalnym, jest drugie ograniczenie naturalnej wolności narzucone przez Locke’a: działanie jest niesprawiedliwe, jeśli stanowi nieuzasadnione zagrożenie dla życia i mienia innej osoby.<br/><br/>Te różnice w traktowaniu przez dwóch autorów równości, wolności i sprawiedliwości lub niesprawiedliwości kulminują w ich interpretacji relacji między stanem natury a stanem wojny. Z punktu widzenia Hobbesa oba są synonimami, ponieważ bezwzględna konkurencja jest jedynym logicznym rezultatem umieszczania ludzi o równoważnych zdolnościach i podobnych potrzebach w środowisku o ograniczonych zasobach. On stwierdza ten związek wprost: "jeśli dwoje ludzi pragnie tej samej rzeczy, z której jednak nie mogą się cieszyć, stają się wrogami" i dlatego są w stanie wojny ze sobą (Hobbes 75). Ponieważ jednak ludzie są liczni i wszyscy posiadają podobne zdolności i potrzeby, konkurencja ta przejawia się nie tylko w indywidualnych interakcjach, ale także na poziomie ludzkości jako całości. Dopóki wszyscy ludzie mają równe i nieograniczone prawa do wszystkich zasobów, a nawet do wzajemnych ciał i życia, stan natury jest wojną „każdego człowieka przeciwko każdemu człowiekowi” (Hobbes 76). Ta ponura interpretacja wywodzi się bezpośrednio z przedstawienia przez Hobbesa stanu natury, rządzonego wyłącznie przez egoistyczne popędy jednostek.<br/><br/>Locke, z drugiej strony, rozróżnia stan natury i stan wojny i wskazuje, że chociaż mogą one występować jednocześnie, nie ma powodu, aby utożsamiać się z drugim. Definicja stanu wojny Locke'a jest praktycznie identyczna z definicją Hobbesa. Według Locke'a, "ten, kto próbuje doprowadzić innego człowieka do jego absolutnej władzy, stawia się tym samym w stanie wojny z nim" (14). Wyjaśnienie to doskonale pokrywa się z hobbesowskim poglądem, że powszechne prawo każdego do wszystkiego, w tym do ciał i życia innych ludzi, prowadzi do stanu wojny. Jednak Locke odmawia zrównania stanu wojny i stanu natury właśnie dlatego, że zaprzecza Hobbesowej interpretacji naturalnej wolności. Ponieważ naturalny stan Locke'a powstrzymuje ludzi przed krzywdzeniem siebie nawzajem poprzez drugie ograniczenie wolności, próba naruszenia wolności innej osoby jest naruszeniem prawa naturalnego. Podczas gdy dla Hobbesa wojna jest domyślnie stanem ludzkości, Locke przedstawia ją jako perwersję stanu natury, a nie jej rządów.<br/><br/>Te różnice w określeniu państwa natury i jej składników, takich jak wolność, równość, sprawiedliwość i wojna, utorować drogę do autorów kontrastujących portretów rządu. Opierając się na swojej pesymistycznej ocenie stanu natury, autor Lewiatana dochodzi do wniosku, że w warunkach wojny nie może być pewnej nadziei na „przeżywanie czasu, który natura zwykle pozwala ludziom żyć” (Hobbes 80). Rozwiązaniem jest ustanowienie powszechnego prawa do wszystkiego i pozostawienie każdemu „tyle wolności wobec innych ludzi, ile pozwoliłby innym ludziom przeciw sobie” (Hobbes 80). Uczestnicy wynikającego z tego kontraktu społecznego przeznaczają nieograniczone swobody, które poddali, na suwerena – nosiciela najwyższej władzy, której celem jest zachowanie osiągniętego status quo poprzez karanie wszystkich wykroczeń przeciwko niemu. Władza suwerenna jest absolutna: władca ma władzę „uczynić wszystko, co uzna za konieczne”, aby promować pokój między swoimi poddanymi, aby nikt nie atakował życia lub własności drugiego człowieka. Hobbes dochodzi do wniosku, że bez takiej niepodważalnej postaci uprawnionej do czynienia czegokolwiek z poddanymi, nie może istnieć pokój i gwarancja bezpieczeństwa.<br/><br/>Podczas gdy Locke zgadza się z koniecznością tworzenia politycznie zorganizowanych społeczeństw, mimo to sprzeciwia się idei Hobbesa o suwerennej władzy jako nieograniczonej i niepodważalnej. Jak wspomniano powyżej, stan natury Locke'a nie jest tak straszny, jak ten namalowany przez Hobbesa z powodu obowiązku ludzi do zachowania nie tylko siebie, ale także siebie nawzajem. Dlatego potrzeba umowy społecznej nie wynika ze strachu przed innymi, ale z samej wygody. Małe społeczności mogą nie potrzebować licznych przepisów do rozwiązywania konfliktów i „urzędników do nadzorowania procesu”, ale większe stowarzyszenia uważają za wskazane ustanowienie rządów w tym celu (Locke 57). Jednak władza rządu nie może być nieograniczona, ponieważ spowodowałoby to podporządkowanie poddanych „niezmiennej, niepewnej, nieznanej, arbitralnej woli innego człowieka” (Locke 17). Taki rząd stanowiłby podwójne naruszenie prawa naturalnego. Zgadzając się na absolutną władzę innej osoby nad swoim życiem, podmiot naruszyłby swoje pierwsze ograniczenie zabraniające krzywdzenia siebie. Jeśli chodzi o władcę, zniszczenie wolności innej osoby stanowiłoby bezpośrednią szkodę i jako takie byłoby sprzeczne z drugim ograniczeniem.<br/><br/>Jako bezpośrednią kontynuację swojej sprawy o nieograniczoną władzę rządową, Hobbes zaprzecza podziałowi władzy jako zasadzie. Z jego punktu widzenia suweren, gdy już został ustanowiony, posiada „całą władzę nakazywania zasad” rządzących życiem poddanych, a w skrócie władzę ustawodawczą (por. Hobbes 114). Władca zastrzega sobie również prawo do „wysłuchania i rozstrzygnięcia wszystkich kontrowersji” – to znaczy władzy sądowej (Hobbes 114). Wreszcie, ponieważ celem suwerena jest zmuszenie poddanych do powstrzymania się od krzywdzenia siebie nawzajem, nie może być wątpliwości, że władza wykonawcza jest również jego wyłączną prerogatywą. Podział władzy jako koncepcja jest obcy Hobbesowi ze względu na jego poglądy na stan natury. Stworzenie jednostki politycznej, w której władza wykonawcza, ustawodawcza i sądownicza sprawdzałyby się nawzajem – to znaczy konkurowałyby – oznaczałoby odtworzenie na wyższym poziomie hobbesowskiego stanu natury jako wojny. Ponieważ ludzie wchodzą w umowę społeczną i ustanowić rząd, aby umieścić stan natury za nimi, a nie przywrócić go w innej formie, podział władzy sprzeczne poglądy Hobbes bezpośrednio.<br/><br/>Locke, z drugiej strony, przyjmuje podział władzy jako podstawową zasadę swojej teorii politycznej. Jego argument za podziałem jest oczywisty w dyskusji o granicach władzy ustawodawczej. Jak stwierdza Locke, trudno byłoby wskazać, aby te same osoby, które mają władzę tworzenia praw, miały w swoich rękach również władzę ich egzekwowania. Filozof wskazuje na niedoskonałości ludzkiej natury i wrodzoną chęć „uchwycenia władzy” jako uzasadnienie tego środka ostrożności (Locke 76). Podobnie jak w przypadku Hobbes, Locke's rachunek podziału władzy wynika bezpośrednio z jego interpretacji stanu natury. Jeśli w stanie natury istnieje już sprawiedliwość i ludzie mogą ją zrozumieć, każdy rząd nieuchronnie podlega temu samemu prawu naturalnemu. Ponieważ absolutna władza nad ludźmi narusza oba ograniczenia tego prawa, rozdzielanie i rozdzielanie go jest wskazane, aby rząd działał prawidłowo.<br/><br/>Niniejsza praca wykazała, że chociaż różnice między Hobbes i Locke's rachunki naturalnego stanu ludzkości są liczne, one ostatecznie stanowią obecność braku przesłanek moralnych. Hobbes postrzega stan naturalny jako stan nieograniczonej wolności, w którym ludzie obdarowani równymi zdolnościami i niezwiązani żadnymi pojęciami moralnymi, takimi jak sprawiedliwość, nieustannie konkurują o zasoby. Locke interpretuje jednak równość i wolność etycznie, a nie praktycznie, i uważa, że wojna jest perwersją stanu naturalnego, ponieważ prawo naturalne zobowiązuje ludzi do nie szkodzenia sobie nawzajem. Hobbes nalega na wszechmocnego władcę, ponieważ, w przypadku braku ograniczeń etycznych, żaden inny autorytet nie może zmusić ludzi do powstrzymania się od krzywdzenia siebie nawzajem. Jednak, z punktu widzenia Locke'a, przyznanie rządowi nieograniczonych uprawnień byłoby sprzeczne z etycznymi ograniczeniami zawartymi w prawie natury, dlatego, w przeciwieństwie do Hobbesa, opowiada się za podziałem władzy. |
| Fashion Police: What Game of Thrones threw up<br/><br/>Canadian-French singer Abbas Hasan put blinding effort to outshine all of humanity at Fashion Parade 2014. Nothing wrong with that, except safety is priority and the musician is a health hazard here.<br/><br/>We get he wants to be a star. Sadly, he didn't get the memo where they tell the desperate and the infamous that stardom is a metaphor. You don't have to look like one and literally set our sight ablaze. Also, the All Pakistan Aunty Association has officially lodged a complaint against him. The local market has run dry of fake crystals and sequined monstrosities. They have nothing to wear to their biweekly high teas and they claim he is to blame. Apparently, the outfit is inspired by Game of Thrones. Can he please stick to composing sad songs about his neighbour's dead dog instead of conceptualising outfits? Or maybe it's the trauma of losing the dog, whose death he is clearly not over as he is still wearing its carcass.<br/><br/>The charge sheet Outfit<br/><br/>No one can decide where the outfit begins and where Abbas ends. You stare in fascination, sinking into a deep abyss and wonder why he is wearing leather pants. Whose horse did he kill to steal the saddle draped across his shoulders? Was he in prison right before his red carpet appearance and forgot to take off the chains? How will he survive the synthetic leather and post-sequin rash that is bound to be lethal in such high dosage? Why am I still alive?<br/><br/>Idea<br/><br/>His inspiration was seemingly Game of Thrones, but he eventually ended up looking like he was thrown out of a Viking restaurant. Had he come across any of the characters from the show, he would've been slain in the first five seconds of the first episode.<br/><br/>The mental health or lack thereof: Someone get him to a counsellor ASAP! He seems to be under the assumption that wearing a dead dog means that the only friend he had in his life is still alive. Dear Abbas:<br/><br/>1. Denial is not a river in Egypt<br/><br/>2. Your tortured psyche is not helping your music, so get help<br/><br/>3. Try imaginary friends<br/><br/>Bail out!<br/><br/>All of us at the Fashion Police headquarters are severely traumatised. Abbas is someone we did not enjoy arresting. He is currently in custody and attempting revenge by putting on attires from other fantasy shows. He just glitter glued himself in order to look like Edward Cullen from Twilight. As a public service message and to prevent further nervous breakdowns, we gave him the following examples of men from the red carpet of the same event.<br/><br/>Zohaib Hassan<br/><br/>When in doubt, play it safe. The singer looks like your average uncle at a shaadi. A plain black suit with no accessories, even if it's a tad disproportionate, is workable. Zohaib's look is blended into everything and nothing, and when you don't have a fashion sense or the money to hire a stylist, this is okay. It does not carry the risk of cardiac arrest for fellow attendees at an event. Given Abbas' delicate mental condition, this look is what he should aim for. Always and forever.<br/><br/>Ali Zafar<br/><br/>One day, after decades of therapy, Abbas could aspire to wear attire like Ali Zafar's. The dapper summer look is done to near perfection. Ali came really close to looking like a maître d at a French restaurant with his white summer jacket with black lapels, but the shirt saves it, never mind the satin. His pants would have been ridiculous had they not been folded at the ankles. The shoes are what hipster chic happy endings are made of. | Fashion Police: What Game of Thrones wymiotowało<br/><br/>Kanadyjsko-francuski piosenkarz Abbas Hasan umieścił oślepiające wysiłki, aby zaćmić całą ludzkość na Fashion Parade 2014. Nic złego w tym, z wyjątkiem bezpieczeństwa jest priorytetem i muzyk jest zagrożeniem dla zdrowia tutaj.<br/><br/>Rozumiemy, że chce być gwiazdą. Niestety, nie dostał notatki, w której mówią zdesperowanym i niesławnym, że gwiazda jest metaforą. Nie musisz tak wyglądać i dosłownie rozpalić nasz wzrok. Również All Pakistan Aunty Association oficjalnie złożyło skargę przeciwko niemu. Lokalny rynek wyschł od fałszywych kryształów i cekinowych potworności. Nie mają nic do założenia na swoje dwutygodniowe wysokie herbaty i twierdzą, że jest winny. Najwyraźniej strój jest zainspirowany Grą o Tron. Czy może on trzymać się komponowania smutnych piosenek o martwym psie sąsiada zamiast konceptualizować stroje? A może to trauma utraty psa, którego śmierć najwyraźniej nie jest skończona, ponieważ nadal nosi jego zwłoki.<br/><br/>Arkusz ładowania Outfit<br/><br/>Nikt nie może zdecydować, gdzie zaczyna się strój, a gdzie kończy Abbas. Patrzysz w fascynacji, tonąc w głębokiej otchłani i zastanawiasz się, dlaczego nosi skórzane spodnie. Czyj koń zabił, aby ukraść siodło zasłonięte przez ramiona? Był w więzieniu tuż przed pojawieniem się na czerwonym dywanie i zapomniał zdjąć łańcuchy? Jak przetrwa wysypkę ze skóry syntetycznej i wysypkę po cekinach, która w tak dużej dawce musi być śmiertelna? Dlaczego wciąż żyję?<br/><br/>Pomysł<br/><br/>Jego inspiracją była najwyraźniej Gra o Tron, ale ostatecznie wyglądał tak, jakby został wyrzucony z restauracji wikingów. Gdyby natknął się na którąkolwiek z postaci z serialu, zostałby zabity w pierwszych pięciu sekundach pierwszego odcinka.<br/><br/>Zdrowie psychiczne lub jego brak: Ktoś zabierze go do doradcy ASAP! Wydaje się, że jest pod założeniem, że noszenie martwego psa oznacza, że jedyny przyjaciel, którego miał w swoim życiu, nadal żyje. Drogi Abbas:<br/><br/>1. Zaprzeczenie nie jest rzeką w Egipcie<br/><br/>2. Twoja torturowana psychika nie pomaga twojej muzyce, więc poszukaj pomocy<br/><br/>3. Spróbuj wyimaginowanych przyjaciół<br/><br/>Wyciągnij kaucję!<br/><br/>Wszyscy w kwaterze głównej Policji Mody jesteśmy poważnie traumatyzowani. Abbas jest kimś, kogo nie lubiliśmy aresztować. Obecnie jest w areszcie i próbuje się zemścić, zakładając stroje z innych pokazów fantasy. Po prostu błyszczał, aby wyglądać jak Edward Cullen z Twilight. Jako komunikat służby publicznej i aby zapobiec dalszym załamaniom nerwowym, podaliśmy mu następujące przykłady mężczyzn z czerwonego dywanu tego samego wydarzenia.<br/><br/>Zohaib Hassan<br/><br/>Kiedy masz wątpliwości, graj bezpiecznie. Piosenkarka wygląda jak twój przeciętny wujek w shaadi. Zwykły czarny garnitur bez akcesoriów, nawet jeśli jest nieproporcjonalny, jest wykonalny. Wygląd Zohaib łączy się ze wszystkim i niczym, a gdy nie masz poczucia mody lub pieniędzy na zatrudnienie stylisty, to jest w porządku. Nie niesie ryzyka zatrzymania akcji serca dla innych uczestników imprezy. Biorąc pod uwagę delikatny stan psychiczny Abbasa, to spojrzenie jest tym, do czego powinien dążyć... zawsze i na zawsze.<br/><br/>Ali Zafar<br/><br/>Pewnego dnia, po dziesięcioleciach terapii, Abbas mógł aspirować do noszenia stroju jak Ali Zafar. Ali zbliżył się do wyglądania jak maestro d we francuskiej restauracji z białą letnią kurtką z czarnymi klapami, ale koszula go ratuje, nie mówiąc już o satynie. Jego spodnie byłyby śmieszne, gdyby nie zostały złożone w kostkach. Buty są tym, z czego wykonane są hipsterskie szykowne szczęśliwe zakończenia. |
| Determining soil hydraulic properties with different wetting liquids : A thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the Degree of Master of Science at Lincoln University<br/><br/>Abstract<br/><br/>Soil hydraulic properties such as hydraulic conductivity, water retention and plant water relationships dominate the water movement processes. For example, the infiltration, evaporation and water flow within the soil. As a widespread phenomenon in soil, soil water repellency alters the soil hydraulic functions by resisting the water flow into the soils. Moreover, the hydraulic properties not only depend on the pore system of soil but also are affected by the physicochemical properties of the pore surfaces. Compared to water, ethanol is not affected by the water repellency due to its lower surface tension. The purpose of using ethanol is to eliminate the effect of soil water repellency on hydraulic properties measurements. However, applying pure ethanol into natural soil can degrade the soil organic materials and lead to changes in physical properties. Therefore, the aqueous ethanol solutions can be an alternative option. Nevertheless, the feasibility of using aqueous ethanol for determining soil liquid retention curve remains unknown. This study aims to test the feasibility of the aqueous ethanol solutions (0, 10 %, 20 %, 30 %, 40 %, 50 % and 100 % v/v) for establishing liquid retention curve under a small range of applied pressure in coarse sand samples with different wettability and organic amended natural soil (Templeton silt loam (TSL) with mushroom compost, biochar, dairy effluent, and municipal compost, the application rate was 15 % by weight). The result showed that the desorption of testing aqueous ethanol solutions compared to water was quicker by approximately 1 to 3x based on the liquid content at the same applied pressure and the time for reaching each equilibrium. The outcomes from the sand experiment suggested that when the concentration of aqueous ethanol solution was below 50 %, the losses via evaporation were less than 1% and the relative differences between testing liquid and water was lower than 10 %. However, the evaporation losses were 11.06 % and 24.6 %, and the relative differences were all around 15 % and 30 % in 50 % and 100 % ethanol solution, respectively. In contrast, the organic amendments in Templeton silt loam not only increased the water retention capability but also reduced the evaporation losses. The evaporation losses in TSL soil and TSL with organic amendments soil were with 1 % in solutions with less than 50 % ethanol content. Evaporation losses of 50 % and 100 % ethanol were 2.8 % and 2.9 %, respectively. The relative differences between water and testing liquid were similar to the sand experiment when the testing liquid concentrations were below 50 %. However, the relative differences in 50 % and 100 % ethanol solution were smaller than in the sand sample with around 10 % and 15%, respectively. Additionally, the analysis of relative difference suggested that almost all aqueous ethanol solutions had lower volumetric liquid content at the same supplied pressure compared to water, which was a reflection of the aqueous ethanol solutions desorbed faster than water under equivalent pressure. Therefore, 10 % to 40 % of ethanol solutions could be considered an alternative for determining soil hydraulic properties due to their faster desorption rate and not being affected by soil water repellency. Due to the evaporation and dissolution of organic material, aqueous ethanol solutions above 50% concentration were not suitable for coarse sand or medium-textured soil.... [Show full abstract] | Określanie właściwości hydraulicznych gleby z różnymi cieczami zwilżającymi : Praca magisterska złożona w częściowym spełnieniu wymagań do uzyskania tytułu magistra nauk ścisłych na Uniwersytecie Lincolna<br/><br/>abstrakcyjny<br/><br/>Właściwości hydrauliczne gleby, takie jak przewodność hydrauliczna, zatrzymywanie wody i relacje wody roślinnej, dominują w procesach przepływu wody. Na przykład infiltracja, odparowanie i przepływ wody w glebie. Jako powszechne zjawisko w glebie, odporność gleby na wodę zmienia funkcje hydrauliczne gleby, opierając się przepływowi wody do gleby. Ponadto właściwości hydrauliczne nie tylko zależą od układu porów gleby, ale także wpływają na właściwości fizykochemiczne powierzchni porów. W porównaniu z wodą, etanol nie ma wpływu na odporność na wodę ze względu na niższe napięcie powierzchniowe. Celem stosowania etanolu jest wyeliminowanie wpływu odpychania wody glebowej na pomiary właściwości hydraulicznych. Jednak zastosowanie czystego etanolu do naturalnej gleby może spowodować degradację materiałów organicznych gleby i prowadzić do zmian właściwości fizycznych. Dlatego alternatywną opcją mogą być wodne roztwory etanolu. Niemniej jednak wykonalność zastosowania wodnego etanolu do określenia krzywej retencji cieczy w glebie pozostaje nieznana. Niniejsze badanie ma na celu sprawdzenie wykonalności wodnych roztworów etanolu (0, 10 %, 20 %, 30 %, 40 %, 50 % i 100 % w/v) w celu ustalenia krzywej retencji cieczy pod niewielkim zakresem ciśnienia stosowanego w próbkach piasku szorstkiego o różnej zwilżalności i organicznych modyfikowanych glebach naturalnych (Templeton mulu (TSL) z kompostem grzywnym grzywowym, biowę, biowę, kompost, kompost, kompost, kompost 15 % kompostu komunowego i kompost. Wyniki pokazały, że desorpcja badanych roztworów etanolu wodnego w porównaniu z wodą była szybsza o około 1 do 3 razy w zależności od zawartości cieczy przy tym samym zastosowanym ciśnieniu i czasie osiągnięcia każdej równowagi. Wyniki eksperymentu z piaskiem sugerowały, że gdy stężenie wodnego roztworu etanolu było poniżej 50%, straty w wyniku odparowania były mniejsze niż 1%, a względne różnice między badaną cieczą a wodą były mniejsze niż 10%. Jednakże straty parowania wyniosły 11,06 % i 24,6 %, a względne różnice wyniosły odpowiednio około 15 % i 30 % w 50 % i 100 % roztworze etanolu. Natomiast zmiany organiczne w błocie Templeton nie tylko zwiększyły zdolność zatrzymywania wody, ale także zmniejszyły straty związane z odparowaniem. Straty związane z odparowaniem w glebie TSL i w glebie TSL z organicznymi modyfikacjami wyniosły 1 % w roztworach o zawartości etanolu mniejszej niż 50 %. Straty związane z odparowaniem wyniosły odpowiednio 2,8 % i 2,9 %. Względne różnice między wodą a badaną cieczą były podobne do eksperymentu z piaskiem, gdy badane stężenie cieczy było poniżej 50%. Jednak względne różnice w 50 % i 100 % roztworze etanolu były mniejsze niż w próbce piasku, wynosząc odpowiednio około 10 % i 15 %. Ponadto analiza względnej różnicy sugerowała, że prawie wszystkie wodne roztwory etanolu miały niższą objętościową zawartość cieczy przy tym samym dostarczanym ciśnieniu w porównaniu z wodą, co było odzwierciedleniem wodnych roztworów etanolu desorbowanych szybciej niż woda pod równoważnym ciśnieniem. W związku z tym 10–40 % roztworów etanolu można uznać za alternatywę do określenia właściwości hydraulicznych gleby ze względu na ich szybszą szybkość desorpcji i brak wpływu na odporność gleby na wodę. Ze względu na odparowanie i rozpuszczenie materiału organicznego, wodne roztwory etanolu powyżej 50% stężenia nie były odpowiednie dla grubego piasku lub gleby o średniej fakturze....
