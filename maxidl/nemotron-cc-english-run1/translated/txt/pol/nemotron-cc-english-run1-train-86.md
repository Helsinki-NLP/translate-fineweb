| Leclaire<br/><br/>The historic Leclaire neighborhood, once referred to as Edwardsville's "suburb to the south," was founded as a cooperative community in 1890 and remained a separate village until annexed to the city of Edwardsville in 1934. Newspapers and magazines throughout the United States and Europe reported on the Leclaire experiment, particularly during the first 20 years of its existence. In 1979, due to its unique history, the former village was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.<br/><br/>Leclaire was founded by Nelson Oliver Nelson, a St. Louis plumbing manufacturer who, for many years, sought to advance the plight of the working class. Nelson wanted to improve working conditions for his employees and provide housing near the factories so workers and their families could easily participate in recreational and educational programs offered free of charge by the company. Prior to 1890, while still in St. Louis, the N. O. Nelson Company's manufacturing and distribution businesses began providing profit sharing along with educational and recreational opportunities. The Leclaire cooperative experiment would bring additional benefits.<br/><br/>When Nelson employees indicated they wanted to relocate to a rural location, company representatives approached leaders of small towns in several Missouri and Illinois communities near their St. Louis headquarters. They were looking for a suitable property to build new factories and a model village. South of Edwardsville they found a 125-acre tract of land with access to water, coal, and transportation. Local businessmen acted quickly to offer a financial incentive. In less than three weeks, the community raised a fund of $20,000 from individual contributions of between $1 and $1,000 to entice Nelson to choose Edwardsville for his enterprise.<br/><br/>City leaders had hoped to locate property inside the city limits of Edwardsville, but when no suitable site could be found, they were confident that the Nelson investment south of town would soon become a part of Edwardsville. Although Nelson fulfilled all the contingencies for construction and job creation in his contract, it would be 44 years before annexation to Edwardsville. Leclaire, bounded by Madison/Brown Avenues to the east, the railroad tracks to the west, Hadley/McKinley Avenues on the south and Wolf Street to the north, remained an independent village from 1890 to 1934. During that time it earned a reputation for innovations in business, education and residential planning.<br/><br/>The village of Leclaire on a 1931 map of Edwardsville<br/>Courtesy of Paul Jenkins<br/><br/>Nelson's decision to build a village was not made on a whim. By the late 1880s he was an international leader in the fields of cooperation and profit-sharing, exchanging social theories with others around the world while expanding his St. Louis business. He named his experimental village after the Parisian profit-sharer, Edme Jean Leclaire, but he visited many other social visionaries who provided information and inspiration. Compiling the best ideas from these examples, Nelson founded Leclaire to, in his words, "give work, promote intelligence, provide recreation, foster beauty, and make homes." These were all factors he determined necessary for men to lead fulfilling lives. Later writers used these words to formulate Leclaire's founding principles: Work, Homes, Education, Recreation, and Beauty, but with the additional important principle of Freedom.<br/><br/>Work<br/><br/>Work could be considered the most important of these factors since without the factory jobs in Leclaire, there would be no village. The brick factory buildings were designed by architect E. A. Cameron to provide natural light, ventilation in the summer, and heated floors in the winter. There was a fire suppression system and, although industrial accidents were not eliminated, every effort was made to guarantee the safety of the workers. The ivy-covered brick buildings were surrounded by well-manicured lawns and flower gardens giving the complex a campus-like appearance. In 1894, New York World reporter Nellie Bly called the buildings "the ideal perfection of buildings for man to labor in".<br/><br/>The manufacturing complex of the N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company in Leclaire<br/>From Friends of Leclaire<br/><br/>Nelson company policies were designed to protect the financial stability of employees. Workers could earn a share of the profits and have a voice in the company if they chose that option. The profit-sharing plan gave Nelson employees a pride of ownership that resulted in a supportive workforce. There were a few short-lived labor strikes over the years, but for the most part, labor problems were rare. Workers also had reasonable hours and competitive wages. There was a provident fund that provided for pensions and sick leave, as well as widow pensions if a worker died, whether or not the death was related to his employment.<br/><br/>Company headquarters for the N. O. Nelson Company (NONCO) remained in St. Louis, but all of the N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company was moved to Leclaire. The manufacturing company was divided into shops that made a variety of products. In 1900, the shops became independent companies for tax purposes, but all were still owned by the N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company. The shops included the Cabinet Mill where wood products from cabinetry to millwork were produced. The skilled craftsmen that worked here also fulfilled special contracts, including teller cages for a local bank and an altar still in use at St. Andrew's Episcopal Church in Edwardsville. The Marble Shop specialized in architectural marble that was cut and installed by Nelson crews in homes, businesses, and even state capitols throughout the Midwest. The Machine Shop, which became Bignall and Keeler, made pipe fitting machines, pumps, gauges, and various mechanical tools expected in the plumbing trade. They also branched out to manufacture specialty items like the Leclaire Bicycle in the mid-1890s. The Brass Shop included a foundry where various plumbing pipes and tools were manufactured. These examples represent just some of the work done in the Leclaire factories. The company's logo was a stylized "NONCO" that can still be seen on plumbing fixtures and some fire hydrants in Edwardsville today.<br/><br/>Homes<br/><br/>Before homes could be built, housing was needed for workers who were completing the factory buildings as well as building homes. To meet those needs, the company built the "Club House," a large building that served many purposes. In addition to lodging, it was the community's first educational building, and it contained a well-stocked library.<br/><br/>Construction of the residential portion of Leclaire began immediately after the village was founded in June of 1890. Julius Pitzman, the innovative landscape architect who laid out the first lots in Leclaire, set them up with a number of protective covenants. The covenants provided for wide, curvilinear streets, large lots, and a deed restriction that limited the properties to residential or educational purposes only. The company paved the streets, provided electric street lights, installed sidewalks, and planted hundreds of trees along the streets of Leclaire. Later sections of Leclaire were laid out with a conventional grid design and smaller lots, but still included the deed restrictions.<br/><br/>A Leclaire Victorian cottage in 1907<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Initially the homes were built by the company and then sold at near cost to Nelson employees to encourage home ownership. If a worker became ill and could not make his mortgage, payments were suspended until after he returned to work. The homes were offered in a variety of house designs and the company advertised that no two dwellings were alike. The earliest homes were primarily Victorian cottages that came with electricity and running water. These were followed by bungalows, foursquares, and even some kit homes. Residents could purchase a company-built home or buy an empty lot and build a house themselves, provided the architectural design met company standards.<br/><br/>In later years, lots were sold to investors, usually Edwardsville residents, and many homes in the 1920s were built by local contractors who then sold them to area residents.<br/><br/>Education<br/><br/>Nelson believed in education for everyone, including the working class. Educational programming began with a kindergarten at the Club House in 1892 and continued in the new educational building at 722 Holyoake Road. Commonly called the "School House," this building provided a large hall for meetings and programs, but had moveable partitions to divide it into classroom space during the day. In the evenings, there were dances, meetings, or programs of the Leclaire Self-Culture Club which featured weekly lectures by Washington University professors or nationally known speakers who, like N. O. Nelson, were part of the social betterment movement at the turn of the century. These included Jane Addams, Edward Everett Hale, Samuel "Golden Rule" Jones, and author Charlotte Perkins Gilman, among others.<br/><br/>Children enrolled in the Leclaire kindergarten in 1913<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>In the ten years following the 1895 construction of the education building, there were a series of educational experiments including an industrial school, college, night school, and an academy. The earliest and longest-lived endeavor was the morning kindergarten, founded in 1892, that used the Fröbel Model. This two-year program was free to everyone, including Edwardsville children, until 1931 when for financial reasons the company began charging tuition to students who were not the children of employees. Nelson Manufacturing operated a kindergarten until 1934 when the building was turned over to the Edwardsville School District for a nominal fee.<br/><br/>Recreation<br/><br/>Boaters on Leclaire Lake in 1915<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Recreation was an important feature of Leclaire. The company provided sports facilities for baseball, tennis, and later, football. A bowling and billiard hall was constructed and there was a lake for boating, swimming, fishing, or ice skating in winter. Leclaire Park was furnished with boathouses, male & female bath houses, and a large pavilion. Residents organized dances, hayrides, spelling bees, and other activities, and the company sponsored a band that played regularly at entertainments in the village or in Edwardsville. Like the educational functions at the Club House and School House, the recreational facilities at Leclaire were open to all and were often a destination for Edwardsville and even St. Louis visitors.<br/><br/>Beauty<br/><br/>Early photograph of Leclaire Lake<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>The last of the factors Nelson deemed important for a satisfying life concerned the environment. Nelson knew about the importance of healthy living. He valued the beauty and cleanliness that could be found in the country, and encouraged all in Leclaire to beautify their property by planting gardens and orchards. Nelson himself led by example, so a company greenhouse provided free flowers and competitions were held for the most beautiful yards. Leclaire was laid out so that the entire village had a park-like setting still evident today.<br/><br/>Freedom<br/><br/>The Leclaire Cooperative store<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Nelson listed five founding principles for Leclaire, but modern writers add a sixth: Freedom. All of the programs offered by the company were available to employees as well as local residents, but none were mandatory. The freedom to choose whether or not to participate in company programs was entirely up to the individual. Residents of Leclaire could work for Nelson Manufacturing or elsewhere, and workers were under no obligation to live in Leclaire. Participation in recreational and educational programs was also optional. There was also a company store where employees could shop, but unlike other company towns, no one was in debt to the company store. The Leclaire Store was a cooperative where members were charged fair market prices, but were then paid quarterly dividends.<br/><br/>A Different Company Town<br/><br/>All of these benefits made Leclaire unique from other company towns. But there were also individual instances where the company showed compassion and care for the employees. The company closed the factories and hired excursion trains to take workers and their families to St. Louis for a day at the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair. When money was tight, Nelson would occasionally place extra cash in each pay envelope to make life easier for workers, and if he instituted a program the men did not agree with, they talked it out and, as often as not, Nelson would reverse himself.<br/><br/>Born in Lillesand, Norway, in 1841, N. O. Nelson was a complicated man. He was a capitalist who believed in free enterprise, but also a socialist, a follower of the "Golden Rule", and a patriot who served for the Union in the Civil War. By 1900, he was a multimillionaire, but by the time of his death in 1922, he had given it all away for the betterment of the working class.<br/><br/>Although Leclaire was not Nelson's only social experiment, it is considered his most successful endeavor. Other major efforts for social betterment included a chain of co-operative grocery stores in New Orleans, a kindergarten for the children of black employees in his Bessemer, Alabama, factories, and a home for consumptives in Indio, California.<br/><br/>Nelson's Village of Leclaire was renowned internationally as a noteworthy and successful experiment. It was described in the New York World on numerous occasions but in particular by reporter Nellie Bly in 1894 who wrote at length about the model town where "The labor question is solved and everybody happy in a little village near St. Louis." The Los Angeles Times also regularly reported on N. O. Nelson, as did the Chicago Daily Tribune and numerous other publications.<br/><br/>In a speech at Leclaire's 15th anniversary celebration in 1915, Nelson said, "Leclaire extends to you a wide open hospitality, and bids you enjoy today the ease and comfort and beauty and inspiration which we enjoy every day." More than a century has passed since that day, but the invitation still stands. Residents and researchers are invited to learn about Leclaire's history and consider the lessons that might be learned for the betterment of future generations.<br/><br/>One of the former buildings of the manufacturing complex in 2019, which now serves as the N. O. Nelson Campus of Lewis and Clark Community College<br/>Photo by Ben Ostermeier<br/><br/>Friends of Leclaire, organized in 1990 following Leclaire's Centennial celebration, promotes the history of Leclaire through a website (historic-leclaire.org), publications, and a festival, Leclaire Parkfest, held annually on the third Sunday in October | Leclaire<br/><br/>Historyczna dzielnica Leclaire, niegdyś nazywana „przedmieściem Edwardsville na południu”, została założona jako wspólnota spółdzielcza w 1890 roku i pozostała odrębną wioską, aż do przyłączenia do miasta Edwardsville w 1934 roku. Gazety i czasopisma w Stanach Zjednoczonych i Europie donosiły o eksperymencie Leclaire, szczególnie w ciągu pierwszych 20 lat jego istnienia. W 1979 roku, ze względu na swoją unikalną historię, dawna wioska została wpisana do Krajowego Rejestru Miejsc Historycznych.<br/><br/>Leclaire został założony przez Nelsona Olivera Nelsona, producenta hydrauliki w St. Louis, który przez wiele lat starał się przyspieszyć trudną sytuację klasy robotniczej. Nelson chciał poprawić warunki pracy swoich pracowników i zapewnić mieszkania w pobliżu fabryk, aby pracownicy i ich rodziny mogli łatwo uczestniczyć w programach rekreacyjnych i edukacyjnych oferowanych bezpłatnie przez firmę. Przed 1890 roku, będąc jeszcze w St. Louis, N. O. Nelson Company produkcja i dystrybucja firmy zaczęła zapewniać podział zysków wraz z możliwościami edukacyjnymi i rekreacyjnymi. Eksperyment spółdzielczy Leclaire przyniósłby dodatkowe korzyści.<br/><br/>Kiedy pracownicy Nelsona wskazali, że chcą przenieść się do wiejskiej lokalizacji, przedstawiciele firmy zwrócili się do przywódców małych miasteczek w kilku społecznościach Missouri i Illinois w pobliżu ich siedziby głównej w St. Szukali odpowiedniej nieruchomości do budowy nowych fabryk i modelowej wioski. Na południe od Edwardsville znaleźli 125-akrowy obszar ziemi z dostępem do wody, węgla i transportu. Lokalni biznesmeni szybko zareagowali, aby zaoferować zachętę finansową. W mniej niż trzy tygodnie społeczność zebrała fundusz w wysokości 20 000 USD z indywidualnych wkładów w wysokości od 1 do 1000 USD, aby zachęcić Nelsona do wyboru Edwardsville do swojego przedsięwzięcia.<br/><br/>Liderzy miasta mieli nadzieję zlokalizować nieruchomości w granicach miasta Edwardsville, ale gdy nie można było znaleźć odpowiedniej lokalizacji, byli pewni, że inwestycja Nelson na południe od miasta wkrótce stanie się częścią Edwardsville. Chociaż Nelson spełnił wszystkie warunki dotyczące budowy i tworzenia miejsc pracy w swoim kontrakcie, minęło 44 lata przed aneksją Edwardsville. Leclaire, ograniczona przez Madison/Brown Avenues na wschodzie, tory kolejowe na zachodzie, Hadley/McKinley Avenues na południu i Wolf Street na północy, pozostała niezależną wioską od 1890 do 1934 roku. W tym czasie zyskał reputację innowacji w biznesie, edukacji i planowaniu mieszkaniowym.<br/><br/>Wioska Leclaire na mapie Edwardsville z 1931 roku<br/>Dzięki uprzejmości Paula Jenkinsa<br/><br/>Pod koniec lat osiemdziesiątych Nelson był międzynarodowym liderem w dziedzinie współpracy i podziału zysków, wymieniając się teoriami społecznymi z innymi na całym świecie, jednocześnie rozszerzając swoją działalność w St. Louis. Nazwał swoją eksperymentalną wioskę na cześć paryskiego dzielnika zysków, Edme Jean Leclaire, ale odwiedził wielu innych wizjonerów społecznych, którzy dostarczyli informacji i inspiracji. Zestawiając najlepsze pomysły z tych przykładów, Nelson założył Leclaire'a, aby, według jego słów, "dawać pracę, promować inteligencję, zapewniać rekreację, pielęgnować piękno i tworzyć domy". Były to wszystkie czynniki, które uznał za niezbędne dla mężczyzn, aby prowadzić satysfakcjonujące życie. Później pisarze użyli tych słów do sformułowania podstawowych zasad Leclaire'a: Praca, domy, edukacja, rekreacja i piękno, ale z dodatkową ważną zasadą wolności.<br/><br/>Praca<br/><br/>Praca może być uważana za najważniejszy z tych czynników, ponieważ bez pracy w fabryce w Leclaire nie byłoby wioski. Budynki fabryki cegieł zostały zaprojektowane przez architekta E. A. Camerona, aby zapewnić naturalne światło, wentylację latem i ogrzewane podłogi w zimie. Powstał system gaszenia pożarów i chociaż wypadki przemysłowe nie zostały wyeliminowane, dołożono wszelkich starań, aby zagwarantować bezpieczeństwo pracowników. Budynki pokryte bluszczem były otoczone dobrze zadbanymi trawnikami i ogrodami kwiatowymi, nadając kompleksowi wygląd kampusu. W 1894 roku nowojorska reporterka Nellie Bly nazwała budynki „idealną doskonałością budynków dla człowieka do pracy”.<br/><br/>Kompleks produkcyjny N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company w Leclaire<br/>Przyjaciele Leclaire<br/><br/>Polityka firmy Nelson została zaprojektowana w celu ochrony stabilności finansowej pracowników. Pracownicy mogliby zarobić część zysków i mieć głos w firmie, jeśli wybraliby tę opcję. Plan podziału zysków dał pracownikom Nelsona dumę z własności, która doprowadziła do wspierającej siły roboczej. Było kilka krótkotrwałych strajków pracowniczych na przestrzeni lat, ale w większości przypadków problemy z pracą były rzadkie. Pracownicy mieli również rozsądne godziny pracy i konkurencyjne wynagrodzenie. Był fundusz opiekuńczy, który zapewniał emerytury i urlopy chorobowe, a także emerytury wdowy, jeśli pracownik zmarł, niezależnie od tego, czy śmierć była związana z jego zatrudnieniem.<br/><br/>Siedziba firmy N. O. Nelson Company (NONCO) pozostała w St. Louis, ale cała firma N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company została przeniesiona do Leclaire. Firma produkcyjna została podzielona na sklepy, które wytwarzały różne produkty. W 1900 roku sklepy stały się niezależnymi firmami do celów podatkowych, ale wszystkie były nadal własnością N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company. Sklepy obejmowały młyn gabinetowy, w którym produkowane były wyroby z drewna od szafek do młynów. Wykwalifikowani rzemieślnicy, którzy tu pracowali, wypełniali również specjalne umowy, w tym klatki kasjerskie dla lokalnego banku i ołtarz nadal używany w kościele episkopalnym św. Andrzeja w Edwardsville. Marble Shop specjalizował się w marmurze architektonicznym, który został wycinany i instalowany przez załogi Nelsona w domach, firmach, a nawet w stolicach stanowych na całym Środkowym Zachodzie. Sklep maszynowy, który stał się Bignall i Keeler, produkował maszyny do montażu rur, pompy, mierniki i różne narzędzia mechaniczne oczekiwane w branży hydraulicznej. Rozgałęzili się również do produkcji specjalnych przedmiotów, takich jak rower Leclaire w połowie lat 90. Brass Shop obejmował odlewnię, w której produkowano różne rury i narzędzia hydrauliczne. Przykłady te reprezentują tylko niektóre z prac wykonanych w fabrykach Leclaire. Logo firmy było stylizowanym „NONCO”, które do dziś można zobaczyć na oprawach hydraulicznych i niektórych hydrantach przeciwpożarowych w Edwardsville.<br/><br/>Domy<br/><br/>Zanim można było budować domy, potrzebne były mieszkania dla pracowników, którzy ukończyli budynki fabryczne, a także budowali domy. Aby zaspokoić te potrzeby, firma zbudowała „Klubowy Dom”, duży budynek, który służył wielu celom. Oprócz zakwaterowania był to pierwszy budynek edukacyjny społeczności i zawierał dobrze zaopatrzoną bibliotekę.<br/><br/>Budowa części mieszkalnej Leclaire rozpoczęła się zaraz po założeniu wioski w czerwcu 1890 roku. Julius Pitzman, innowacyjny architekt krajobrazu, który położył pierwsze parcele w Leclaire, ustanowił je szeregiem przymierzy ochronnych. Przymierza przewidywały szerokie, krzywoliniowe ulice, duże parcele i ograniczenie aktu, które ograniczało nieruchomości wyłącznie do celów mieszkalnych lub edukacyjnych. Firma wybrukowała ulice, dostarczyła elektryczne światła uliczne, zainstalowała chodniki i posadziła setki drzew wzdłuż ulic Leclaire. Późniejsze sekcje Leclaire zostały ułożone z konwencjonalną konstrukcją siatki i mniejszymi partiami, ale nadal zawierały ograniczenia aktu.<br/><br/>Wiktoriański domek Leclaire w 1907 roku<br/>Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Początkowo domy zostały zbudowane przez firmę, a następnie sprzedane pracownikom Nelsona po niemal koszcie, aby zachęcić do posiadania domu. Jeśli pracownik zachorował i nie mógł uiścić kredytu hipotecznego, płatności były zawieszane aż do powrotu do pracy. Domy były oferowane w różnych projektach domów, a firma reklamowała, że nie ma dwóch podobnych mieszkań. Najwcześniejsze domy były głównie wiktoriańskie domki, które pochodziły z prądem i bieżącą wodą. Po nich nastąpiły bungalowy, kwadraty, a nawet niektóre domy kit. Mieszkańcy mogli kupić wybudowany przez firmę dom lub kupić pustą parcelę i zbudować dom samodzielnie, pod warunkiem, że projekt architektoniczny spełniał standardy firmy.<br/><br/>W późniejszych latach parcele zostały sprzedane inwestorom, zwykle mieszkańcom Edwardsville, a wiele domów w 1920 roku zostało zbudowanych przez lokalnych kontrahentów, którzy następnie sprzedali je mieszkańcom obszaru.<br/><br/>Edukacja<br/><br/>Nelson wierzył w edukację dla wszystkich, w tym klasy robotniczej. Programowanie edukacyjne rozpoczęło się od przedszkola w Club House w 1892 roku i kontynuowano w nowym budynku edukacyjnym przy Holyoake Road 722. Powszechnie nazywany "School House", ten budynek zapewniał dużą salę spotkań i programów, ale miał ruchome przegrody, aby podzielić go na przestrzeń klasową w ciągu dnia. Wieczorem odbywały się tańce, spotkania lub programy klubu Leclaire Self-Culture Club, w którym co tydzień wykładali profesorowie Uniwersytetu Waszyngtońskiego lub znani mówcy narodowi, którzy, podobnie jak N.O. Nelson, byli częścią ruchu poprawy społecznej na przełomie stulecia. Należeli do nich Jane Addams, Edward Everett Hale, Samuel "Golden Rule" Jones i autorka Charlotte Perkins Gilman, między innymi.<br/><br/>Dzieci zapisane do przedszkola Leclaire w 1913 roku<br/>Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>W ciągu dziesięciu lat po budowie budynku edukacyjnego w 1895 roku przeprowadzono szereg eksperymentów edukacyjnych, w tym szkołę przemysłową, college, szkołę nocną i akademię. Najwcześniejszym i najdłużej żyjącym przedsięwzięciem było przedszkole poranne, założone w 1892 roku, które korzystało z modelu Fröbela. Ten dwuletni program był bezpłatny dla wszystkich, w tym dzieci Edwardsville, aż do 1931 roku, kiedy to ze względów finansowych firma zaczęła pobierać opłaty za naukę od studentów, którzy nie byli dziećmi pracowników. Nelson Manufacturing prowadził przedszkole do 1934 roku, kiedy to budynek został przeniesiony do Edwardsville School District za nominalną opłatą.<br/><br/>Rekreacja<br/><br/>Łodzie na jeziorze Leclaire w 1915 roku<br/>Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Rekreacja była ważną cechą Leclaire. Firma zapewniła obiekty sportowe do baseballu, tenisa, a później piłki nożnej. Wybudowano kręgielnię i bilard, a zimą było jezioro do łodzi, pływania, wędkowania lub łyżwiarstwa. Park Leclaire został wyposażony w łodzie, męskie i żeńskie łaźnie oraz duży pawilon. Mieszkańcy organizowali tańce, hayrides, pisownię pszczół i inne działania, a firma sponsorowała zespół, który regularnie grał na imprezach rozrywkowych w wiosce lub w Edwardsville. Podobnie jak funkcje edukacyjne w Club House i School House, obiekty rekreacyjne w Leclaire były otwarte dla wszystkich i często były miejscem docelowym dla odwiedzających Edwardsville, a nawet St.<br/><br/>Piękno<br/><br/>Zdjęcia - Leclaire Lake<br/>Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Ostatni z czynników, które Nelson uważał za ważne dla satysfakcjonującego życia, dotyczyło środowiska. Nelson wiedział o znaczeniu zdrowego życia. Doceniał piękno i czystość, które można znaleźć w kraju, i zachęcał wszystkich w Leclaire do upiększenia swojej własności poprzez sadzenie ogrodów i sadów. Sam Nelson kierował się przykładem, więc szklarnia firmy zapewniała bezpłatne kwiaty i odbywały się konkursy na najpiękniejsze podwórka. Leclaire został ułożony tak, że cała wioska miała parkową scenerię do dziś widoczną.<br/><br/>Wolność<br/><br/>Sklep Leclaire Cooperative<br/>Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Nelson wymienił pięć podstawowych zasad Leclaire, ale współcześni pisarze dodają szóstą: Wolność. Wszystkie programy oferowane przez firmę były dostępne zarówno dla pracowników, jak i lokalnych mieszkańców, ale żaden z nich nie był obowiązkowy. Swoboda wyboru, czy brać udział w programach firmowych, była całkowicie zależna od jednostki. Mieszkańcy Leclaire mogli pracować dla Nelson Manufacturing lub gdzie indziej, a pracownicy nie mieli obowiązku mieszkać w Leclaire. Udział w programach rekreacyjnych i edukacyjnych był również opcjonalny. Był również sklep firmowy, w którym pracownicy mogli robić zakupy, ale w przeciwieństwie do innych miast firmowych nikt nie był zadłużony wobec sklepu firmowego. Leclaire Store był spółdzielnią, w której członkowie pobierali sprawiedliwe ceny rynkowe, ale następnie wypłacali kwartalne dywidendy.<br/><br/>Różne miasto firmy<br/><br/>Wszystkie te korzyści sprawiły, że Leclaire był wyjątkowy w innych miastach firmy, ale zdarzały się również indywidualne przypadki, w których firma okazywała współczucie i troskę o pracowników. Firma zamknęła fabryki i wynajęła pociągi wycieczkowe, aby zabrać pracowników i ich rodziny do St. Louis na jeden dzień na targach w 1904 roku. Kiedy pieniądze były ograniczone, Nelson od czasu do czasu umieszczał dodatkowe pieniądze w każdej kopercie wynagrodzenia, aby ułatwić życie pracownikom, a jeśli wprowadził program, z którym mężczyźni się nie zgadzali, rozmawiali o tym, a tak często, jak nie, Nelson odwracał się.<br/><br/>Urodzony w Lillesand w Norwegii w 1841 roku, N. O. Nelson był skomplikowanym człowiekiem. Był kapitalistą, który wierzył w wolną przedsiębiorczość, ale także socjalistą, zwolennikiem "Złotej Reguły" i patriotą, który służył Unii w wojnie domowej. W 1900 roku był multimilionerem, ale przed śmiercią w 1922 roku oddał wszystko na poprawę klasy robotniczej.<br/><br/>Chociaż Leclaire nie był jedynym eksperymentem społecznym Nelsona, jest uważany za jego najbardziej udane przedsięwzięcie. Inne duże wysiłki na rzecz poprawy sytuacji społecznej obejmowały sieć spółdzielczych sklepów spożywczych w Nowym Orleanie, przedszkole dla dzieci czarnych pracowników w Bessemer w stanie Alabama, fabryki i dom dla konsumentów w Indio w Kalifornii.<br/><br/>Nelson's Village of Leclaire był znany na całym świecie jako godny uwagi i udany eksperyment. Został on opisany w Nowym Jorku World przy wielu okazjach, ale w szczególności przez reporterkę Nellie Bly w 1894 roku, który napisał obszernie o modelu miasta, gdzie "kwestia pracy jest rozwiązana i wszyscy szczęśliwi w małej wiosce w pobliżu St. Los Angeles Times regularnie informował również o N.O. Nelson, podobnie jak Chicago Daily Tribune i wiele innych publikacji.<br/><br/>W przemówieniu na uroczystości 15-lecia Leclaire'a w 1915 roku Nelson powiedział: "Leclaire rozszerza do ciebie szeroko otwartą gościnność i oferuje ci dziś cieszyć się łatwością i komfortem, pięknem i inspiracją, którą cieszymy się każdego dnia". Od tego dnia minęło ponad sto lat, ale zaproszenie wciąż trwa. Mieszkańcy i badacze są zachęcani do zapoznania się z historią Leclaire i rozważenia lekcji, które można wyciągnąć dla poprawy przyszłych pokoleń.<br/><br/>Jeden z dawnych budynków kompleksu produkcyjnego w 2019 roku, który obecnie służy jako kampus N.

| Author Visits via Zoom or Skype<br/><br/>I'm excited to visit with your students via Zoom or Skype! Skype is a great option for schools/classes who aren't bringing in in-person authors, but who want to explore books and poetry, connect with an author, and ask one-on-one questions.<br/><br/>Cost<br/><br/>I offer 30-45-minute Zoom or Skype visits with schools for $125 per session (or $200 for two sessions happening within three hours in the morning or the afternoon; $325 for three sessions in one day; $425 for four sessions in one day). In each session, I try to get kids as actively involved as possible. No, it's not the same kind of connection as an in-person visit offers, but it can still be inspiring and motivating for kids!<br/><br/>What I Do<br/><br/>Each session for up to 50 students includes:<br/><br/>5 minutes of tech set-up<br/><br/>3 segments of 10ish-minutes each — You choose from:<br/><br/>How I became a writer<br/><br/>Writing this particular book (you choose which book I focus on)<br/><br/>Reading (I read some poems and kids help me read others)<br/><br/>Classroom presentation (your students put on a reading or performance for me—a very appreciative audience!)<br/><br/>Writing a poem together<br/><br/>Question and answer session<br/><br/>5 minutes of wrap-ups/goodbyes<br/><br/>I also chat with classes of pre-service teachers or groups of in-service teachers about poetry and writing.<br/><br/>Tips for a Great Virtual Visit<br/><br/>Tips for a Successful Virtual Visit<br/><br/>One of my goals for virtual school visits is to capture the interactivity that makes in-person visits successful and fun. But the truth is that sometimes it's tough to be virtually interactive! The timing might not sync up correctly, which makes reading together a challenge, and it's really hard for me to hear individual students unless they come up and speak directly into the microphone/computer. But after some trial and error, I've discovered some ways to have the best virtual visits possible. Here they are: 10 ways to make my visit with your students a great experience!<br/><br/>Before the Visit<br/><br/>Get kids as excited as possible about the visit. Visit my website with them. Read some of my books with them. Gather some questions students have for me. Anything you do ahead of time to make it feel like a BIG DEAL will go a long way toward student engagement.<br/><br/>Position the video camera or laptop with webcam so that I can see as much of the audience as possible. It's hard to assess student engagement when I can only see a couple of students.<br/><br/>Limit each group to 50 students. It's incredibly hard to engage large groups via video.<br/><br/>I'll move quickly from topic to topic or poem to poem. Please remind students that they'll need to listen closely to understand what's going on.<br/><br/>Occasionally, I do a little Reader's Theater with students. If I send you any scripted student parts ahead of time, print a copy for EACH session and cut into pieces, if needed.<br/><br/>During the Visit<br/><br/>When I discuss a book, if you have that printed book, please hold it up for students to see.<br/><br/>You are my proxy. I often can't call on students and hear individual replies. So, I might say, "We're going to get 3 ideas. Raise your hand if you have an idea." Then YOU take over, call on three students, and announce those answers to everyone in the room and to me.<br/><br/>Choose confident, outgoing students for scripted student parts (if I send any ahead of time). During my in-person school visits, I try to draw out some of the less confident students, but I've found that this doesn't work as well during virtual visits because I can't hear them.<br/><br/>Have students with speaking parts sit up front. When it's time, have them stand up and remind them to speak loudly.<br/><br/>In virtual visits, behavior management falls solely on you. I often can't see exactly what's going on, so do please step in as needed. If there's a big disruption, just ask me to hold on for a moment so that I don't chatter on while nobody's paying attention:>)<br/><br/>Feel free to take pictures of me on-screen and share on social media–even though pictures of me often look ridiculous because I'm making funny faces or something while I read!<br/><br/>If you have any questions at all, please just ask, either before or during the visit!<br/><br/>Scheduling a Virtual Session<br/><br/>Are you interested in scheduling a virtual visit with me? Just email me to set up a date, and we'll go from there | Autor Wizyty przez Zoom lub Skype<br/><br/>Cieszę się, że mogę odwiedzić twoich uczniów przez Zoom lub Skype! Skype to świetna opcja dla szkół / klas, które nie przynoszą osobiście autorów, ale chcą odkrywać książki i poezję, łączyć się z autorem i zadawać pytania jeden na jednego.<br/><br/>Koszt<br/><br/>Oferuję 30-45-minutowe wizyty Zoom lub Skype ze szkołami za 125 USD za sesję (lub 200 USD za dwie sesje odbywające się w ciągu trzech godzin rano lub po południu; 325 USD za trzy sesje w jednym dniu; 425 USD za cztery sesje w jednym dniu). W każdej sesji staram się jak najbardziej aktywnie angażować dzieci. Nie, nie jest to taki sam rodzaj połączenia, jaki oferuje wizyta osobista, ale nadal może być inspirujące i motywujące dla dzieci!<br/><br/>Co robię<br/><br/>Każda sesja dla maksymalnie 50 studentów obejmuje:<br/><br/>5 minut ustawień technologicznych<br/><br/>3 segmenty po 10 minut każdy — Wybierasz spośród:<br/><br/>Jak zostałem pisarzem<br/><br/>Pisanie tej konkretnej książki (wybierasz, na której książce się skupię)<br/><br/>Czytanie (czytam niektóre wiersze, a dzieci pomagają mi czytać inne)<br/><br/>Prezentacja w klasie (twoi uczniowie umieścili dla mnie lekturę lub występ - bardzo wdzięczna publiczność!)<br/><br/>Wspólnie napisać wiersz<br/><br/>Sesja pytań i odpowiedzi<br/><br/>5 minut na pożegnania/pożegnania<br/><br/>Rozmawiam również z klasami nauczycieli przed służbą lub grupami nauczycieli na służbie o poezji i pisaniu.<br/><br/>Wskazówki dotyczące wspaniałej wirtualnej wizyty<br/><br/>Wskazówki dotyczące udanej wirtualnej wizyty<br/><br/>Jednym z moich celów w wirtualnych wizytach szkolnych jest uchwycenie interaktywności, która sprawia, że osobiste wizyty są udane i zabawne. Ale prawda jest taka, że czasami trudno jest być praktycznie interaktywnym! Czas może nie być prawidłowo zsynchronizowany, co sprawia, że wspólne czytanie jest wyzwaniem, i naprawdę trudno mi jest usłyszeć poszczególnych uczniów, chyba że podejdą i przemówią bezpośrednio do mikrofonu / komputera. Ale po kilku próbach i błędach odkryłem kilka sposobów na jak najlepsze wirtualne wizyty. Oto: 10 sposobów, aby moja wizyta z uczniami była świetnym doświadczeniem!<br/><br/>Przed wizytą<br/><br/>Zachęć dzieci do jak największego podekscytowania wizytą. Odwiedź moją stronę internetową z nimi. Przeczytaj z nimi niektóre z moich książek. Zbierz kilka pytań, które studenci mają dla mnie. Wszystko, co zrobisz z wyprzedzeniem, aby poczuć się jak BIG DEAL, przejdzie długą drogę w kierunku zaangażowania studentów.<br/><br/>Umieść kamerę wideo lub laptopa z kamerą internetową, abym mógł zobaczyć jak najwięcej publiczności. Trudno ocenić zaangażowanie studentów, gdy widzę tylko kilku studentów.<br/><br/>Ogranicz każdą grupę do 50 uczniów. Niesamowicie trudno jest zaangażować duże grupy za pośrednictwem wideo.<br/><br/>Szybko przejdę od tematu do tematu lub wiersza do wiersza. Proszę przypomnieć uczniom, że muszą uważnie słuchać, aby zrozumieć, co się dzieje.<br/><br/>Od czasu do czasu robię mały Reader's Theater ze studentami. Jeśli wyślę ci jakieś skrypty studenckie z wyprzedzeniem, wydrukuj kopię KAŻDEJ sesji i pociąć na kawałki, jeśli to konieczne.<br/><br/>Podczas wizyty<br/><br/>Kiedy mówię o książce, jeśli masz tę drukowaną książkę, proszę, trzymaj ją, aby uczniowie mogli ją zobaczyć.<br/><br/>Jesteś moim pełnomocnikiem. Często nie mogę zadzwonić do studentów i usłyszeć indywidualnych odpowiedzi. Więc mogę powiedzieć: "Zdobędziemy 3 pomysły. Podnieś rękę, jeśli masz pomysł." Następnie przejmujesz kontrolę, dzwonisz do trzech studentów i ogłaszasz te odpowiedzi wszystkim w pokoju i mnie.<br/><br/>Wybierz pewnych siebie, wychodzących studentów do skryptowych części studenckich (jeśli wyślę z wyprzedzeniem). Podczas moich wizyt w szkole osobiście staram się wyciągnąć niektórych mniej pewnych siebie uczniów, ale odkryłem, że to nie działa tak dobrze podczas wirtualnych wizyt, ponieważ nie mogę ich usłyszeć.<br/><br/>Niech uczniowie z częściami mówiącymi usiądą z przodu. Kiedy nadejdzie czas, niech wstaną i przypomną im, aby mówili głośno.<br/><br/>W wirtualnych wizytach zarządzanie zachowaniem spada wyłącznie na ciebie. Często nie widzę dokładnie, co się dzieje, więc w razie potrzeby wejdź. Jeśli jest duże zakłócenie, poproś mnie, abym na chwilę zatrzymał się, abym nie gadał, gdy nikt nie zwraca uwagi:>)<br/><br/>Zapraszam do robienia mi zdjęć na ekranie i dzielenia się nimi w mediach społecznościowych – nawet jeśli moje zdjęcia często wyglądają śmiesznie, ponieważ robię śmieszne twarze lub coś takiego podczas czytania!<br/><br/>Jeśli masz jakiekolwiek pytania, po prostu zapytaj, przed lub w trakcie wizyty!<br/><br/>Planowanie wirtualnej sesji<br/><br/>Czy jesteś zainteresowany zaplanowaniem wirtualnej wizyty ze mną? Po prostu napisz do mnie, aby ustalić datę, a my pójdziemy stamtąd |

On the one hand it has prompted stigma and violence and on the other it has brought about constructive and supportive responses from various individuals and groups. A new book, Acting on HIV, edited by Prof. Dennis Francis, Dean of the Faculty of Education at the University of the Free State, looks at how drama can be used to promote vital social change as well as individual behavioural change.<br/><br/>Acting on HIV offers a systematic inquiry into drama as an approach to discuss HIV/AIDS and related attitudes and behaviours. The book is a scholarly text and includes the work of some twenty exceptionally creative authors. Contributing authors to the book include, amongst others, Proff. Hazel Barnes (University of the Witwatersrand), Rob Pattman (Stellenbosch University) and Yvonne Sliep from the University of KwaZulu-Natal.<br/><br/>"This project started in 2009 and has taken much of my time to bring together the work of exceptionally creative authors. The research that is communicated through the book is original and timely and makes a significant contribution to conversations about the role/s and significance of drama in addressing issues of HIV & AIDS," says Prof. Francis | Archiwum wiadomości<br/><br/>Nowa książka omawia sposoby radzenia sobie z wyzwaniami związanymi z HIV<br/><br/>2011-11-29<br/><br/>Prof. Dennis Francis z Marjorie Human, która zaprojektowała okładkę książki, Działanie na HIV.<br/><br/>Pandemia HIV wywołała u ludzi najlepsze i najgorsze reakcje, z jednej strony wywołała stygmatyzację i przemoc, a z drugiej strony wywołała konstruktywne i wspierające reakcje różnych osób i grup. W nowej książce Acting on HIV, pod redakcją prof. Dennisa Francisa, dziekana Wydziału Edukacji na Uniwersytecie Wolnego Państwa, omówiono, w jaki sposób dramat może być wykorzystany do promowania istotnych zmian społecznych, a także indywidualnych zmian behawioralnych.<br/><br/>Działanie na temat HIV oferuje systematyczne badanie dramatu jako podejścia do dyskusji na temat HIV / AIDS i powiązanych postaw i zachowań. Książka jest tekstem naukowym i obejmuje pracę około dwudziestu wyjątkowo kreatywnych autorów. Autorami książki są m.in. prof. Hazel Barnes (University of the Witwatersrand), Rob Pattman (Stellenbosch University) i Yvonne Sliep z Uniwersytetu KwaZulu-Natal.<br/><br/>„Ten projekt rozpoczął się w 2009 roku i zajął mi wiele czasu, aby połączyć prace wyjątkowo kreatywnych autorów. Badania, które są komunikowane za pośrednictwem książki, są oryginalne i terminowe i wnoszą znaczący wkład w rozmowy na temat roli i znaczenia dramatu w rozwiązywaniu problemów związanych z HIV i AIDS ", mówi prof. Franciszek. |

| Storyworld Spotlight<br/><br/>25 years of Tomb Raider<br/><br/>Tomb Raider is one of the most recognizable entertainment properties in the world. Since Lara Croft's first videogame appearance in Tomb Raider (1996), her exploits as an adventurous and quick-witted explorer have resonated widely with players, earning her a place in the pantheon of great pop culture characters. For that reason we will be putting The World of Lara Croft in the Storyworld Spotlight from December 22, 2021 to March 6, 2022.<br/><br/>Crafting a Croft<br/><br/>Lara Croft was created by studio Core Design, in Derby (UK), in 1996. The studio was looking for a lead character for their upcoming a 3D adventure game for PlayStation 1. A game in a 3rd person perspective where players would see the main character in full throughout every scene.<br/><br/>As the game was about 'raiding mysterious tombs deep under pyramids,' the lead character would need to look adventurous, and have the brains to survive complex raiding missions. After some deliberation, Lara Croft was born, a young, upper-class and utterly British woman, who was as enigmatic and intelligent as she was tough and self-reliant.<br/><br/>Success and controversy<br/><br/>Tomb Raider (1996) was a breakaway success for Core Design, who quickly doubled down on building Tomb Raider 2 (1997) and 3 (1998). A big part of the success was attributed to the games' leading lady, who found admirers both with male and female players. This baffled critics who just saw Lara Croft as a sexist cartoon.<br/><br/>Explore The World of Lara Croft in Storyworld<br/><br/>This exhibition explores the successful franchise in-depth. It looks at the history of the games and why its leading lady resonates with so many people. It also dives into the mystery of what makes Tomb Raider games tick, from the deep world building to the clever puzzles and traps, and from fantastic enemy and monster designs to the character design of the legendary heroine.<br/><br/>After all, mysteries are there to explore, and have been for the past 25 years.<br/><br/>Tickets<br/><br/>Buy your tickets for Storyworld online with a start date and entry time from Wednesday December 22.

Od czasu pierwszego pojawienia się Lary Croft w Tomb Raider (1996), jej wyczyny jako odważnej i szybkiej odkrywczyni rozbrzmiewają szeroko wśród graczy, zarabiając jej miejsce w panteonie wielkich postaci popkultury. Z tego powodu od 22 grudnia 2021 roku do 6 marca 2022 roku będziemy umieszczać The World of Lara Croft w Storyworld Spotlight.<br/><br/>Rzemiosło Croft<br/><br/>Lara Croft została stworzona przez studio Core Design w Derby (Wielka Brytania) w 1996 roku. Studio szukało głównej postaci do nadchodzącej gry przygodowej 3D na PlayStation 1. Gra z perspektywy trzeciej osoby, w której gracze widzą głównego bohatera w całości w każdej scenie.<br/><br/>Ponieważ gra była o "raidowaniu tajemniczych grobowców głęboko pod piramidami", główna postać musiałaby wyglądać przygodowo i mieć mózgi, aby przetrwać złożone misje nalotów. Po pewnych rozważaniach urodziła się Lara Croft, młoda, wysoko postawiona i całkowicie Brytyjka, która była równie enigmatyczna i inteligentna, co twarda i niezależna.<br/><br/>Sukces i kontrowersje<br/><br/>Tomb Raider (1996) okazał się wielkim sukcesem dla Core Design, który szybko podwoił się w budowie Tomb Raider 2 (1997) i 3 (1998).

| Real Estate Word of the Day: Option<br/><br/>Option: An agreement to keep open, for a set period, an offer to sell or lease real property. An option can be used, for example, to give the buyer time to resolve questions of financing, title, zoning and feasibility before committing the buyer to purchase. Options are frequently used in the land assemblage process. The option must be supported by its actual consideration, separate and independent of the purchase price of the property. Mere recital of consideration alone is not sufficient except in a lease-option in which the provisions of the lease are themselves sufficient consideration to support the option. An option merely creates a contractual right; it does not give the optionee any estate in the property. At the time the option is signed, the owner does not sell, nor does the buyer purchase, the property. Although the owner is obligated to sell if given notice by the buyer, the buyer is not obligated to purchase. An option to buy is also known as a call; an option to sell is known as a put. | Nieruchomości Słowo dnia: Opcja<br/><br/>Opcja: Umowa na utrzymanie otwartego, przez określony okres, oferty sprzedaży lub dzierżawy nieruchomości. Opcja może być wykorzystana, na przykład, aby dać kupującemu czas na rozwiązanie kwestii finansowania, tytułu, zagospodarowania przestrzennego i wykonalności przed zobowiązaniem kupującego do zakupu. Opcje są często używane w procesie montażu gruntów. Opcja musi być poparta jej faktycznym rozważeniem, oddzielnym i niezależnym od ceny zakupu nieruchomości. Sam motyw rozważenia nie jest wystarczający, z wyjątkiem opcji leasingu, w której same postanowienia leasingu są wystarczającym rozważeniem na poparcie tej opcji. Opcja po prostu tworzy prawo umowne; nie daje opcjonalistom żadnego majątku w nieruchomości. W momencie podpisania opcji właściciel nie sprzedaje, ani kupujący nie kupuje nieruchomości. Chociaż właściciel jest zobowiązany do sprzedaży, jeśli zostanie powiadomiony przez kupującego, kupujący nie jest zobowiązany do zakupu. Opcja kupna jest również znana jako wezwanie; opcja sprzedaży jest znana jako put. |
| Benefits of Carotenoids for the Skin<br/><br/>Have you heard of carotenoids? These powerful phytochemicals are the pigmented constituents found in plants that give flowers, fruits, and leaves their yellow, orange and red colours.<br/><br/>Since the 1930s, scientists have identified about 800 carotenoids and about 40 are found in the human body, including the outermost layer of the epidermis, the dermis and subcutaneous fat. The most common carotenoids are beta-carotene, alpha-carotene, lutein, zeaxanthin, lycopene, and astaxanthin. You can read more about astaxanthin here.<br/><br/>The content of carotenoids in the skin is influenced by numerous factors, including the intake of fruits and vegetables, their bioavailability from various foods, supplementation, exposure to UV radiation, air pollution, alcohol consumption, smoking and stress.<br/><br/>How do Carotenoids Help My Skin?<br/><br/>Carotenoids are some of the best-known antioxidants for the skin and they also have important functions as anti-inflammatory agents.<br/><br/>Healthy Aging and Skin Repair<br/><br/>Antioxidants are essential for healthy skin because they help to prevent free radical damage to cells. Free radical damage causes premature aging and the onset of various types of skin cancers. Carotenoids, along with vitamin E, vitamin C, and Co enzyme Q10 are important dermal antioxidants.<br/><br/>Due to their antioxidant activity, carotenoids support and encourage collagen and elastin production in the skin. This helps to increase the skin's density, thickness, elasticity, and firmness. Collagen and elastin decrease as we age, so getting enough carotenoids in the diet and topically is critical for aging well.<br/><br/>Carotenoids can improve the signs of photoaging, skin discolouration, elasticity, hydration, texture, and can reduce transepidermal water loss.<br/><br/>Astaxanthin in particular stimulates fibroblasts to produce collagen and elastin, inhibits the activity of the enzymes that breakdown collagen and elastin, and shows anti-inflammatory and UV-filtering effects. It has been shown to reduce melanin in the skin, which results in the decrease in the appearance of freckles and melasma.<br/><br/>Anti-acne activity: the anti-inflammatory activity of carotenoids helps to dampen the inflammation and irritation associated with acne. Carotenoids also help to normalize and balance oil secretions from the sebaceous glands. They are valuable agents in skin repair and they stimulate epidermal regeneration, helping to smooth and soften skin.<br/><br/>Where Can I Find Carotenoids?<br/><br/>There are two ways to get your daily dose of carotenoids: through diet and through topical application. The combination of both is the ideal approach to well-aging skincare.<br/><br/>Carotenoids are fat-soluble, so your body needs fat to absorb them (think tomatoes and olive oil, broccoli and butter, or spinach and avocado). Common sources of carotenoids in food are avocado, egg yolks, kale, spinach, carrots, sweet potatoes, papaya, and tomatoes.<br/><br/>While we advocate getting as many of your nutrients and antioxidants as you can from food rather than supplementation; one study showed that astaxanthin combined with collagen hydrolysate significantly improved barrier integrity, reduced transepidermal water loss, and increased the expression of procollagen type I mRNA.<br/><br/>Topical application is key to healthy skin. Studies show that high concentrations of antioxidants in human skin offer the best protection for healthy skin at any age.<br/><br/>At Sarka Botanicals, we blend carotenoid-rich, whole plants such as calendula, dandelion, and extracts like astaxanthin with cold-pressed oils and functional ingredients. Calendula alone contains over 19 different types of carotenoids. This may explain why it has such a long history of use in skin care. Studies show that carotenoids blended with co-enzyme Q10 are especially effective at reducing inflammation and slowing premature skin aging due to sun exposure. | Korzyści z karotenoidów dla skóry<br/><br/>Czy słyszałeś o karotenoidach? Te potężne fitochemikalia są pigmentowanymi składnikami roślin, które dają kwiaty, owoce i pozostawiają swoje żółte, pomarańczowe i czerwone kolory.<br/><br/>Od 1930 roku naukowcy zidentyfikowali około 800 karotenoidów, a około 40 znajduje się w ludzkim ciele, w tym najbardziej zewnętrzną warstwę naskórka, skóry właściwej i tłuszczu podskórnego. Najczęstszymi karotenoidami są beta-karoten, alfa-karoten, luteina, zeaksantyna, likopen i astaksantyna. Możesz przeczytać więcej o astaksantynie tutaj.<br/><br/>Na zawartość karotenoidów w skórze mają wpływ liczne czynniki, w tym spożycie owoców i warzyw, ich biodostępność z różnych pokarmów, suplementacja, narażenie na promieniowanie UV, zanieczyszczenie powietrza, spożywanie alkoholu, palenie i stres.<br/><br/>Jak karotenoidy pomagają mojej skórze?<br/><br/>Karotenoidy są jednymi z najbardziej znanych przeciwutleniaczy dla skóry i mają również ważne funkcje jako środki przeciwzapalne.<br/><br/>Zdrowe starzenie i naprawa skóry<br/><br/>Przeciwutleniacze są niezbędne dla zdrowej skóry, ponieważ pomagają zapobiegać uszkodzeniom wolnych rodników w komórkach. Uszkodzenie wolnych rodników powoduje przedwczesne starzenie się i pojawienie się różnych rodzajów nowotworów skóry. Karotenoidy, wraz z witaminą E, witaminą C i enzymem Co Q10, są ważnymi przeciwutleniaczami skóry.<br/><br/>Ze względu na ich działanie przeciwutleniające, karotenoidy wspierają i zachęcają do produkcji kolagenu i elastyny w skórze. Pomaga to zwiększyć gęstość, grubość, elastyczność i jędrność skóry. Kolagen i elastyna zmniejszają się wraz z wiekiem, więc uzyskanie wystarczającej ilości karotenoidów w diecie i miejscowo ma kluczowe znaczenie dla dobrego starzenia się.<br/><br/>Karotenoidy mogą poprawić objawy fotostarzenia, przebarwienia skóry, elastyczności, nawilżenia, tekstury i mogą zmniejszyć transepidermalną utratę wody.<br/><br/>Astaksantyna w szczególności stymuluje fibroblasty do produkcji kolagenu i elastyny, hamuje aktywność enzymów, które rozkładają kolagen i elastynę, i wykazuje działanie przeciwzapalne i filtrujące promieniowanie UV. Wykazano, że zmniejsza melaniny w skórze, co powoduje zmniejszenie wyglądu piegów i melasmy.<br/><br/>Działanie przeciwtrądzikowe: Działanie przeciwzapalne karotenoidów pomaga zwilżyć stan zapalny i podrażnienie związane z trądzikiem. Karotenoidy pomagają również normalizować i zrównoważyć wydzieliny oleju z gruczołów łojowych. Są cennymi środkami w naprawie skóry i stymulują regenerację naskórka, pomagając wygładzić i zmiękczyć skórę.<br/><br/>Gdzie mogę znaleźć karotenoidy?<br/><br/>Istnieją dwa sposoby na uzyskanie dziennej dawki karotenoidów: poprzez dietę i miejscowe stosowanie. Połączenie obu jest idealnym podejściem do pielęgnacji skóry starzejącej się.<br/><br/>Karotenoidy są rozpuszczalne w tłuszczach, więc organizm potrzebuje tłuszczu, aby je wchłonąć (pomyśl o pomidorach i oliwie z oliwek, brokułach i masle lub szpinaku i awokado). Wspólnymi źródłami karotenoidów w żywności są awokado, żółtka jaj, kapusta, szpinak, marchew, słodkie ziemniaki, papaja i pomidory.<br/><br/>Chociaż zalecamy uzyskanie jak największej ilości składników odżywczych i przeciwutleniaczy z żywności, a nie suplementacji, jedno badanie wykazało, że astaksantyna w połączeniu z hydrolizatem kolagenu znacznie poprawiła integralność bariery, zmniejszyła utratę wody przezskórnej i zwiększyła ekspresję mRNA prokolagenu typu I.<br/><br/>Stosowanie miejscowe jest kluczem do zdrowej skóry. Badania pokazują, że wysokie stężenia przeciwutleniaczy w skórze ludzkiej zapewniają najlepszą ochronę zdrowej skóry w każdym wieku.<br/><br/>W Sarka Botanicals mieszamy bogate w karotenoidy całe rośliny, takie jak nagietek, mniszek lekarski i ekstrakty takie jak astaksantyna z olejami tłoczonymi na zimno i składnikami funkcjonalnymi. Sam nagietek zawiera ponad 19 różnych rodzajów karotenoidów. To może wyjaśniać, dlaczego ma tak długą historię stosowania w pielęgnacji skóry. Badania pokazują, że karotenoidy zmieszane z koenzymem Q10 są szczególnie skuteczne w zmniejszaniu stanu zapalnego i spowalnianiu przedwczesnego starzenia się skóry z powodu ekspozycji na słońce. |
