In simple terms, the condition is characterized by: one develops a kidney disease and undergoes a kidney transplant and other diseases associated with acidic concentration in the blood and gout. In theory, the condition will occur even if the genetic change is inherited from one parent and sporadically occurs when there is no family history.<br/><br/>Common names of autosomal dominant interstitial kidney disease<br/><br/>The condition has other names as well namely: medullary cystic kidney disease, although this name is not used as much because most people suffering from this condition do not have medullary cysts. It is also referred to as juvenile hyperuricemic nephropathy. The disease tends to affect people of ages 20 to 50. The latter condition as aforementioned occurs in young children, something, which translate to get it from both parents.<br/>Cystic kidney disease is an inherited condition whereby the cysts in the centre of each kidney gradually lose their ability to function properly. Cysts refer to abnormal blisters of fluid in the kidney. The condition further scares the kidney making unable to concentrate the urine and as a result, producing too much urine. Its symptoms include excessive urination, salt cravings, weakness, confusion, bleeding, fatigue, frequent hiccups, low blood pressure, nausea and vomiting, headaches, pale skin, reduced sensation in the hands, weight loss among many others. Other complications include: anemia, ulcers, loss of bone density, infertility and other heart related problems.<br/>Its analysis incorporates blood tests to check for sodium levels and general kidney functions, urine tests to check the levels of concentration and other imbalances, x rays to check for the size of kidneys that may be altered owing to increased urine concentrations, renal biopsy and genetic testing to verify any genetic changes that might have taken place in due time.<br/>While the disease does not have a cut and dry treatment to it, one may focus on controlling measures, which include intake of fluids and salt to supplement the one lost as the disease progresses into latter stages. This also helps reduce dehydration. Other treatments include taking of prescribed medication and diet changes and minimal intakes of foods containing phosphorous and potassium. Further complications may also require one to have a kidney transplant. Basically, this is not a curable disease but rather a manageable once detected in the early stages.<br/><br/>The common yet different factor of Autosomal dominant interstitial kidney disease<br/><br/>Nephronophthisis and medullary cystic kidney disease are mainly grouped together because, in essence, they share the same features but with a slight difference in regards inheritance patterns to the former affecting children and the latter affecting young adults and older age groups. Similar features for both are ADH resistant urine concentration that leads to polyuria and polydipsia, anemia and renal diseases.<br/>The former aforementioned condition is Autosomal recessive accounting to 15% of chronic diseases and causes ESRD during early childhood while the latter is Autosomal dominant with a few sporadic new mutations and causes ESRD for people between the ages of 30 and 50. | - Online CPR Certifikat Blog<br/><br/>Datum: 23. srpanj 2014.<br/><br/>- Autosomna dominantna intersticijska bolest bubrega je rijetka zbirka bolesti koje utječu na poznate funkcije bubrega. U jednostavnom smislu, stanje se odlikuje: razvija se bolest bubrega i prolazi se kroz transplantaciju bubrega i drugih bolesti povezanih s kiselom koncentracijom u krvi i gihtom.

| Hobbes' vs. Locke's Account on the State of Nature<br/><br/>Topic: PhilosophyWords: 2539Pages: 9Aug 3rd, 2021<br/><br/>Hobbes and Locke are among the most influential political philosophers to ever write in English. The state of nature, which precedes the organization of the complex societies, is the common premise that both Hobbes and Locke share but interpret in different ways. The former views humans in their natural state as equally dangerous and free to pursue their egoistic goals unrestricted by the nonexistent notions of justice, which is why his natural state amounts to the "war of every man against every man" (Hobbes76). The latter, on the other hand, views humans in their original condition as equally valuable and restricts natural freedom by the idea of justice that requires not to harm others, which allows defining the state of nature as "mutual assistance and preservation" rather than war (Locke 15). The key difference between the two philosophers' accounts of natural state is that Locke uses ethical considerations while Hobbes does not, and it ultimately leads Hobbes to envisage a state exercising unlimited power over human beings, while Locke limits the government by the moral principles, which he considers a natural law.<br/><br/>Hobbes bases his assumptions regarding the state of nature on the fact that all people are roughly equal in their physical and mental capabilities. He admits that some individuals may demonstrate greater physical strength or superior intellect but insists that "when all is reckoned together, the difference between man and man is not so considerable" (Hobbes 74). Since humans are roughly equal in their capabilities, they also have similar hopes to attain their ends and satisfy their needs (Hobbes 75). As a logical outcome of this equality, when the people begin competing for scarce resources, no one may feel entirely secure in his or her possessions. Even if a mighty, cunning, and capable person succeeds in subjugating "the persons of all men he can," it still does not guarantee the ultimate security (Hobbes 75). As no human can obtain such superiority over the others that renders him or her utterly immune to their strength of intellect, no human can feel completely safe when surrounded by his or her equals. Hobbes' equality in the natural state is equality of fear, where all humans view each other as dangerous competitors.<br/><br/>Just as Hobbes, Locke considers all human beings to be fundamentally equal, but assigns a very different meaning to the term. From his perspective, it is not the equality of capabilities, but, rather, the equality of value. He opines that the people "promiscuously born to all the same advantages of nature" should logically enjoy the perfect equality among them, as there is no reason to consider anyone inherently more valuable (Locke 8). The only possible foundation for designating some people as superior to others would be if God "by any manifest declaration of his will, set one above another" (Locke 8). Since such divine sanction of superiority is absent, Locke concludes that the natural equality of all representatives of humankind is not to be called into question. Hobbes approaches equality pragmatically and stresses that people in their natural state are equally dangerous, but Locke employs an ethical approach and emphasizes that humans are equally valuable in God's eyes. This disagreement is but the first difference between the two authors based on the fact that Locke includes God as a premise into his political philosophy, while Hobbes does not.<br/><br/>Another characteristic feature of Hobbes' account of the natural state is his interpretation of liberty. According to Hobbes, the state of nature implies unlimited freedom to do whatever is necessary for one's continued existence. The philosopher defines liberty as "the absence of external impediments" in using one's abilities to attain one's goals (Hobbes 79). The primary purpose of every sentient being is to maintain its continued existence. As a consequence, Hobbesian freedom amounts to the unhindered opportunity to do anything that, in one's judgment, would be best suited to preserve one's life and possessions (Hobbes 79). The only limitation to liberty is that a person cannot do anything contradictory to sustaining his or her life or destroying "the means of preserving the same" (Hobbes 79). Apart from that, there are no boundaries, and everyone has "a right to everything, even to one another's body" if that furthers one's survival (Hobbes 80). Thus, natural liberty, as viewed by Hobbes, is the absence of externally enforced obstacles in pursuing one's right to everything to sustain and secure one's continued existence.<br/><br/>Locke also upholds the idea of natural liberty but, unsurprisingly, approaches it in a manner that is significantly different from that of Hobbes. As soon as he begins discussing liberty in the state of nature, he immediately notes that a state of freedom does not equate "a state of license" (Locke 9). The philosopher identifies two specific limitations to human freedom in the state of nature. The first one is identical to that introduce by Hobbes: however free and independent, a person nevertheless "has not liberty to destroy himself" (Locke 9). Yet the second limitation contradicts Hobbes' prepositions directly. According to Locke, every human being has a natural obligation not to "harm another in his life, health, liberty, or possessions" (9). Just as with his interpretation of equality, the author bases this assertion on ethical and religious grounds: people should preserve each other's existence since they are all creations of the same "omnipotent, and infinitely wise maker" (Locke 9). Thus, Locke's limits liberty in the natural state far more stringently than Hobbes by introducing the obligation to refrain from harming both oneself and the others.<br/><br/>The differences between the two authors also manifest in their accounts of justice in the natural state of humanity. As far as Hobbes is concerned, delineating just and unjust practices is merely the matter of the law. There is no jurisprudence in the state of nature, and the only law governing human beings in their original condition is a natural law that only obliges them to seek personal security. As a result, nothing can be unjust in the original state of the humankind: "notions of right and wrong justice and injustice" have no place and no meaning in the absence of the stringently enforced law (Hobbes 78). As long as the people use their virtually unlimited freedom to ruthlessly compete with each other for resources, to which they are equally entitled, they have no criteria to differentiate between just and unjust actions. Therefore, the Hobbesian state of nature defies the very idea of justice since the author interprets it as a mere function of the formalized and established law.<br/><br/>Locke assigns different meaning to justice and views it not so much in legislative as in the ethical terms. This paper already mentioned that, unlike Hobbes, Locke employs ethical notions and generally bases his political philosophy on moral rather than purely practical presumptions. Locke's natural law, unlike that of Hobbes, obliges human beings to take care of each other rather than simply leaving everyone to fend for themselves. As a result, there is a place for justice and injustice in his state of nature. The author points to this fact himself when noting that no one should deprive another of his or her life of the means of preserving it "unless it be to do justice on an offender" (Locke 9). This statement reveals with the utmost clarity that, according to Locke, there is justice in the state of nature, and, moreover, humans have to preserve it actively. The criterion of justice, which Hobbes' natural state lacks, is the second limitation on natural liberty imposed by Locke: an action is unjust if it constitutes an unwarranted threat to another person's life and possessions.<br/><br/>These differences in the two authors' treatment of equality, liberty, and justice or injustice culminate in their interpretation of the relationship between the state of nature and the state of war. From Hobbes's perspective, the two are synonymous, because the ruthless competition is the only logical outcome of putting people with equivalent capabilities and similar needs in an environment with limited resources. He states this connection outright: "if any two men desire the same thing, which nevertheless they cannot both enjoy, they become enemies" and are, therefore, in the state of war with each other (Hobbes 75). Yet since humans are numerous and all possess similar capabilities and needs, this competition manifests not only in the individual interactions but also on the level of humanity as a whole. As long as all humans have equal and unlimited rights to all resources and even to each other's bodies and lives, the state of nature is a war of "every man against every man" (Hobbes 76). This grim interpretation stems directly from Hobbes' portrayal of the state of nature as governed solely by the individuals' egoistic urges.<br/><br/>Locke, on the other hand, differentiates between the state of nature and the state of war and points out that, while they may occur simultaneously, it is no reason to identify one with the other. Locke's definition of the state of war is virtually identical to that offered by Hobbes. According to Locke, "he who attempts to get another man into his absolute power does thereby put himself into a state of war with him" (14). This explanation lines up perfectly with the Hobbesian notion that everyone's universal right to everything, including the other people's bodies and lives, leads to the state of war. Yet Locke refuses to equate the state of war and the state of nature precisely because he denies Hobbes' interpretation of natural freedom. Since Locke's natural state restrains people from harming each other through the second limitation of liberty, an attempt on another person's freedom is a transgression against the natural law. While for Hobbes, war is the humankind's condition by default, Locke portrays it as a perversion of the state of nature rather than its rule.<br/><br/>These differences in delineating the state on nature and its constituents, such as liberty, equality, justice, and war, pave the way to the authors contrasting portrayals of government. Based on his pessimistic assessment of the state of nature, the author of Leviathan concludes that, under conditions of war, there can be no definite hope for "living out the time which nature ordinarily alloweth men to live" (Hobbes 80). The solution is laying down the universal right to everything and leaving everyone "so much liberty against other men, as he would allow other men against himself" (Hobbes 80). The participants of the resulting social contract invest the unlimited liberties they have surrendered into a sovereign – the bearer of the supreme power whose purpose is to preserve the achieved status quo by punishing all transgressions against it. Sovereign's power is absolute: the ruler has the authority "to do whatsoever he shall think necessary" to promote peace between his subjects so that no one would assail another's life or property (113). Hobbes concludes that without such an unassailable figure entitled with the right to do anything to the subjects, there can be no peace and no guarantee of security.<br/><br/>While Locke agrees with the necessity of creating politically organized societies, he nevertheless opposes Hobbes' idea of the sovereign power as unlimited and unassailable. As mentioned above, Locke's state of nature is not nearly as dreadful as that painted by Hobbes because of the people's obligation to preserve not only themselves but each other as well. Therefore, the need for social contract arises not from the fear of the others, but from the sheer convenience. Small communities may not need numerous laws to solve conflicts and "officers to superintend the process," but larger associations find it advisable to institute governments for that purpose (Locke 57). Yet the power of the government cannot be unlimited because it would result in subduing the subjects to an "inconstant, uncertain, unknown, arbitrary will of another man" (Locke 17). Such a government would constitute a twofold violation of the natural law. By agreeing to another person's absolute power over his life, a subject would violate its first limitation prohibiting to harm oneself. As for the ruler, destroying another person's liberty would constitute direct harm and, as such, be contradictory to the second limitation.<br/><br/>As a direct continuation of his case for unlimited governmental authority, Hobbes denies the separation of powers as a principle. From his perspective, the sovereign, once instituted, possesses "the whole power of prescribing the rules" governing the lives of the subjects or, in shorter terms, the legislative power (Hobbes 114). The sovereign also reserves the right of "hearing and deciding all controversies" – that is, the judicial power (Hobbes 114). Finally, since the entire purpose of the sovereign is to force the subjects to refrain from harming each other, there can be no doubt that executive power is also his or her exclusive prerogative. The separation of powers as a concept is alien to Hobbes because of his views on the state of nature. Creating a political entity where the executive, legislative, and judicial branches would check each other – that is, compete – would mean recreating the Hobbesian state of nature-as-war on a higher level. Since the people enter a social contract and institute a government to put the state of nature behind them, not reinstate it in a different form, the separation of powers contradictory Hobbes' views directly.<br/><br/>Locke, on the other hand, embraces separation of power as a foundational principle of his political theory. His case for the separation is evident in the discussion of the limits of the legislative power. As Locke puts it, it would be hardly advisable "for the same persons, who have the power of making laws, to have also in their hands the power to execute them" (76). The philosopher points to the imperfections of human nature and the inherent desire to "grasp at power" as a rationale for this precautionary measure (Locke 76). Just as in Hobbes' case, Locke's account of the separation of powers stems directly from his interpretation of the state of nature. If there is already justice in the state of nature and the people can understand it, any government is inevitably subject to the same natural law. Since absolute power over people violates both limitations of this law, separating and distributing it is advisable so that the government would function appropriately.<br/><br/>This paper has demonstrated that, while the differences between Hobbes' and Locke's accounts of the natural state of humanity are numerous, they ultimately amount to the presence of absence of moral premises. Hobbes views the natural state as that of unlimited liberty, where people endowed with equal capabilities and not bound by any moral notions, such as justice, compete for the resources unceasingly. Locke, however, interprets equality and liberty ethically rather than practically and opines that war is a perversion of the natural state, as the natural law obliges humans not to harm each other. This disagreement influences the philosophers' approaches to government. Hobbes insists on an all-powerful ruler, as, in the absence of ethical restraints, no other authority could force the humans to refrain from harming each other. Yet, in Locke's view, granting the government unlimited powers would be contradictory to the ethical limitations embedded in the law of nature, which is why he, unlike Hobbes, advocates separation of powers. | Hobbes protiv Lockeovog računa o stanju prirode<br/><br/>Tema: FilozofijaRiječi: 2539Stranice: 9Aug 3., 2021.<br/><br/>Hobbes i Locke su među najutjecajnijim političkim filozofima koji su ikada pisali na engleskom. - Stanje prirode, koje prethodi organizaciji složenih društava, zajednička je pretpostavka koju i Hobbes i Locke dijele ali tumače na različite načine. Nekadašnji ljudi u svom prirodnom stanju smatraju jednako opasnim i slobodnim da slijede svoje egoističke ciljeve neogranièene nepostojećim pojmovima pravde, zbog čega njegovo prirodno stanje iznosi rat svakog čovjeka protiv svakog čovjeka - (Hobbes76). Potonje, s druge strane, ljude u izvornom stanju smatra jednako vrijednim i ograničava prirodnu slobodu idejom pravde koja zahtijeva da ne naude drugima, što omogućava definiranje stanja prirode kao - Mutualne pomoći i očuvanja - a ne rata (Locke 15). Ključna razlika između izvještaja dvojice filozofa o prirodnom stanju je u tome što Locke koristi etička razmatranja dok Hobbes ne, i to na kraju navodi Hobbesa da predviđa državu koja ostvaruje neograničenu moć nad ljudskim bićima, dok Locke ograničava vladu moralnim principima, što on smatra prirodnim zakonom.<br/><br/>Hobbes temelji svoje pretpostavke u vezi sa stanjem prirode na činjenici da su svi ljudi otprilike jednaki u svojim fizičkim i mentalnim sposobnostima. On priznaje da neki pojedinci mogu pokazati veću fizičku snagu ili superiorniji intelekt ali insistira da - kada se sve računa zajedno, razlika između čovjeka i čovjeka nije toliko značajna - (Hobbes 74). S obzirom da su ljudi otprilike jednaki u svojim sposobnostima, također imaju slične nade da će postići svoje ciljeve i zadovoljiti svoje potrebe (Hobbes 75). - Kao logičan ishod ove jednakosti, kada se narod počne natjecati za oskudne resurse, nitko se ne može osjećati potpuno sigurnim u njegovoj i njezinoj imovini. - Čak i ako moćna, lukava i sposobna osoba uspije potčiniti osobe svih ljudi koje može - to još uvijek ne jamči krajnju sigurnost (Hobbes 75). Kako nijedan čovjek ne može dobiti takvu superiornost nad drugima koja njega ili nju čini potpuno imunim na njihovu snagu intelekta, nijedan čovjek se ne može osjećati potpuno sigurnim kada je okružen njegovim ili njezinim jednakima. Hobbesova jednakost u prirodnom stanju je jednakost straha, gdje svi ljudi jedni druge smatraju opasnim konkurentima.<br/><br/>Iz njegove perspektive, to nije jednakost sposobnosti, nego jednakost vrijednosti. On tvrdi da narod, promiskuitetno rođen u svim istim prednostima prirode, treba logično uživati u savršenoj jednakosti među njima, jer nema razloga da se smatra da je itko urođeno vredniji (Locke 8). Jedini mogući temelj za imenovanje nekih ljudi kao superiornijih od drugih bio bi ako bi Bog - bilo kojom očitom deklaracijom svoje volje, postavio jedan iznad drugog - (Locke 8). Kako takvo božansko sankcioniranje superiornosti nema, Locke zaključuje da prirodna jednakost svih predstavnika čovječanstva ne treba dovoditi u pitanje. Hobbes pristupa jednakosti pragmatično i naglašava da su ljudi u prirodnom stanju jednako opasni, ali Locke koristi etički pristup i naglašava da su ljudi jednako vrijedni u Božjim očima. - Ovo neslaganje je samo prva razlika između dva autora zasnovana na činjenici da Locke uključuje Boga kao premisu u njegovu političku filozofiju, dok Hobbes ne.<br/><br/>Prema Hobbesu, stanje prirode podrazumijeva neograničenu slobodu da se uradi sve što je potrebno za kontinuirano postojanje. Filozof definira slobodu kao odsutnost vanjskih prepreka u korištenju nečijih sposobnosti za postizanje nečijih ciljeva (Hobbes 79). primarna svrha svakog svjesnog bića je održavanje njegovog stalnog postojanja. Posljedica toga je da Hobbesova sloboda predstavlja neometanu priliku da se učini bilo što što bi, po nečijem sudu, najbolje odgovaralo očuvanju nečijeg života i posjeda (Hobbes 79). Jedino ograničenje slobode je da osoba ne može učiniti ništa kontradiktorno održavanju svog života ili uništavanju - sredstava očuvanja istoga - (Hobbes 79). - Osim toga, nema granica, i svako ima pravo na sve, čak i jedno drugome na tijelo - ako to produljuje nečiji opstanak (Hobbes 80). Dakle, prirodna sloboda, kao što vidi Hobbes, je odsustvo spoljno nametnutih prepreka u ostvarivanju nečijeg prava na sve kako bi se održalo i osiguralo kontinuirano postojanje.<br/><br/>Locke također podržava ideju prirodne slobode ali, ne iznenađujuće, prilazi joj na način koji se znatno razlikuje od Hobbesove. Čim počne diskutirati o slobodi u stanju prirode, odmah napominje da stanje slobode ne izjednačava stanje licence (Locke 9). filozof identificira dva specifična ograničenja za ljudsku slobodu u stanju prirode. Prva je identična onoj koju je uveo Hobbes: koliko god slobodna i nezavisna osoba, ipak nema slobodu da se uništi. (Locke 9). Ipak, druga granica proturječi Hobbesovim predlozima direktno. Prema Lockeu, svako ljudsko biće ima prirodnu obavezu da ne naudi drugom u svom životu, zdravlju, slobodi ili posjedima (9). Baš kao i njegovo tumačenje jednakosti, autor temelji ovu tvrdnju na etičkim i vjerskim osnovama: ljudi bi trebali očuvati postojanje jedni drugih budući da su sve kreacije istog - moćnog, i beskrajno mudrog stvaraoca - (Locke 9). Tako Locke ograničava slobodu u prirodnom stanju daleko strože od Hobbesa uvođenjem obveze suzdržavanja od nanošenja štete i sebi i drugima.<br/><br/>Razlike između dvojice autora manifestiraju se i u njihovim izvještajima o pravdi u prirodnom stanju čovječanstva. - U stanju prirode ne postoji pravosuđe, a jedini zakon kojim se uređuju ljudska bića u njihovom izvornom stanju je prirodni zakon koji ih obavezuje samo da traže osobnu sigurnost. “ Kao rezultat toga, ništa ne može biti nepravedno u prvobitnom stanju čovječanstva: “napomene o ispravnoj i pogrešnoj pravdi i nepravdi — nemaju mjesta i značenja u odsustvu strogo nametnutog zakona (Hobbes 78). Sve dok ljudi koriste svoju praktično neograničenu slobodu da se nemilosrdno nadmeću jedni s drugima za resurse, na koje imaju jednako pravo, nemaju kriterija da razlikuju pravedne i nepravedne postupke. Zbog toga Hobbesijsko stanje prirode prkosi samoj ideji pravde pošto je autor tumači kao puku funkciju formaliziranog i utvrđenog zakona.<br/><br/>Locke dodijeljuje različito značenje pravdi i gleda na nju ne toliko u zakonodavnom nego u etičkom smislu. Ovaj rad je već spomenuo da, za razliku od Hobbesa, Locke koristi etičke pojmove i općenito svoju političku filozofiju temelji na moralnoj, a ne čisto praktičnoj pretpostavci. Lockeov prirodni zakon, za razliku od Hobbesovog, obavezuje ljude da se brinu jedni o drugima, a ne da ostavljaju sve da se brinu sami za sebe. - Autor sam ukazuje na tu činjenicu kada napominje da niko ne treba da liši drugog od svog ili njenog života sredstava da je sačuva - osim ako ne bude da se izvrši pravda nad prestupnikom - (Locke 9). Ova izjava otkriva sa najvećom jasnoćom jasnoćom da, prema Lockeu, postoji pravda u stanju prirode, i, štoviše, ljudi je moraju aktivno očuvati. - Kriterij pravde, koji Hobbesovom prirodnom stanju nedostaje, drugo je ograničenje na prirodnu slobodu koju je nametnuo Locke: akcija je nepravedna ako predstavlja neopravdanu prijetnju tuđem životu i posjedima.<br/><br/>ove razlike u postupanju dvaju autora prema jednakosti, slobodi i pravdi ili nepravdi kulminiraju njihovim tumačenjem odnosa između stanja prirode i stanja rata. Iz Hobbesove perspektive, njih dvoje su sinonimi, jer je nemilosrdno natjecanje jedini logički ishod stavljanja ljudi s ekvivalentnim sposobnostima i sličnim potrebama u okoliš s ograničenim resursima. On otvoreno navodi tu povezanost: - ako bilo koja dva muškarca žele istu stvar, u kojoj ipak ne mogu uživati, postaju neprijatelji - i zato su u stanju rata jedan s drugim (Hobbes 75). - Ipak, budući da su ljudi brojni i da svi posjeduju slične sposobnosti i potrebe, ovo natjecanje se manifestira ne samo u pojedinačnim interakcijama nego i na razini čovječanstva kao cjeline. Sve dok svi ljudi imaju jednaka i neograničena prava na sva sredstva, pa čak i na tijela i živote jedni drugih, stanje prirode je rat svakog čovjeka protiv svakog čovjeka. (Hobbes 76). Ovo turobno tumačenje proističe direktno iz Hobbesovog prikaza stanja prirode kako upravlja isključivo egoističkim nagonima pojedinaca.<br/><br/>Locke, s druge strane, razlikuje stanje prirode i stanje rata i ističe da, dok se oni mogu pojaviti istovremeno, nije razlog da se jedno identificira s drugim. Lockeova definicija ratnog stanja praktično je identična onoj koju nudi Hobbes. Ovo objašnjenje savršeno se poklapa sa Hobbesijskim poimanjem da svačije univerzalno pravo na sve, uključujući tuđa tijela i živote, dovodi do stanja rata. - Locke ipak odbija izjednačiti ratno stanje i stanje prirode upravo zato što poriče Hobbesovo tumačenje prirodne slobode. S obzirom da Lockeovo prirodno stanje sputava ljude da naude jedni drugima kroz drugo ograničenje slobode, pokušaj na slobodu druge osobe je prijestup protiv prirodnog zakona. Dok je za Hobbesa rat nepredviđeno stanje čovječanstva, Locke ga prikazuje kao perverziju stanja prirode, a ne kao njegovu vladavinu.<br/><br/>- Te razlike u razlikovanju države o prirodi i njenim sastavnicama, kao što su sloboda, jednakost, pravda i rat, utiru put autorima u suprotnosti s portretima vlasti. Na osnovu njegove pesimistične procjene stanja prirode, autor Levijatana zaključuje da, u ratnim uvjetima, ne može biti određene nade za proživljavanje vremena koje priroda obično dopušta ljudima da žive. (Hobbes 80). Rješenje je polaganje univerzalnog prava na sve i ostavljanje svima - toliko slobode protiv drugih ljudi, kao što bi dopustio drugim ljudima protiv sebe - (Hobbes 80). - Učesnici nastalog društvenog ugovora ulažu neograničene slobode koje su se predali u suverenu - nosioca vrhovne vlasti čija je svrha očuvanje postignutog statusa quo kažnjavanjem svih prijestupa protiv njega. Vladarova moć je apsolutna: vladar ima ovlast da učini sve što misli da je potrebno da promiče mir između svojih podanika tako da nitko ne bi napao tuđi život ili imovinu (113). Hobbes zaključuje da bez takve neosporne ličnosti koja ima pravo da išta učini subjektima, ne može biti mira i garancije sigurnosti.<br/><br/>- Dok se Locke slaže s nužnošću stvaranja politički organiziranih društava, on se ipak protivi Hobbesovoj ideji suverene vlasti kao neograničene i neosporne. Kao što je gore spomenuto, Lockeovo stanje prirode nije ni približno tako strašno kao ono koje je Hobbes naslikao zbog narodne obaveze da čuvaju ne samo sebe nego i jedni druge. Zbog toga potreba za socijalnim ugovorom ne proizlazi iz straha drugih, već iz čiste praktičnosti. - Malim zajednicama možda neće trebati brojni zakoni da riješe sukobe i - službenici da nadziru proces - ali veće udruge smatraju da je preporučljivo uvesti vlade u tu svrhu (Locke 57). Vlada ipak ne može biti neograničena jer bi to rezultiralo subdukcijom podanika na neprekidnu, nesigurnu, nepoznatu, proizvoljnu volju drugog čovjeka, (Locke 17). Pristajući na apsolutnu moć druge osobe nad svojim životom, subjekt bi prekršio svoje prvo ograničenje kojim bi se zabranilo nanošenje štete sebi. - Što se tiče vladara, uništavanje tuđe slobode predstavljalo bi izravnu štetu i, kao takva, bilo bi proturječno drugoj ograničenosti.<br/><br/>Hobbes kao direktan nastavak svog slučaja za neograničenu vlast vlade poriče razdvajanje ovlasti kao princip. Iz njegove perspektive, suveren, nekada uveden, posjeduje - cijelu moć propisivanja pravila - uređuje živote subjekata ili, u kraćem smislu, zakonodavnu vlast (Hobbes 114). Suveren također zadržava pravo slušanja i odlučivanja svih kontroverza, odnosno sudske vlasti (Hobbes 114). Na kraju, budući da je cijela svrha suverena prisiliti subjekte da se suzdrže od međusobnog povrijeđivanja, nema sumnje da je izvršna vlast također njegovo ili njeno ekskluzivno pravo. - Razdvajanje moći kao koncepta je izvanzemaljsko Hobbesu zbog njegovih stavova o stanju prirode. Stvaranje političkog entiteta u kojem bi izvršni, zakonodavni i pravosudni ogranci provjeravali jedni druge, odnosno nadmetali se, značilo bi rekreaciju Hobbesijskog stanja prirode kao rata na višoj razini. - Pošto ljudi ulaze u društveni ugovor i uspostave vladu koja će staviti stanje prirode iza sebe, a ne ga vraćati u drugačiji oblik, odvajanje ovlasti kontradiktornih Hobbesovih stavova direktno.<br/><br/>Locke, s druge strane, prihvaća odvajanje moći kao temeljni princip svoje političke teorije. Kako Locke kaže, teško da bi bilo preporučljivo da iste osobe, koje imaju moć da donose zakone, imaju i u svojim rukama moć da ih izvrše. (76). Filozof ukazuje na nesavršenosti ljudske prirode i inherentnu želju da se prigrabi na vlasti kao razlog za ovu mjeru predostrožnosti (Locke 76). - Baš kao i u Hobbesovom slučaju, Lockeov izvještaj o odvajanju moći proizlazi direktno iz njegovog tumačenja stanja prirode. - Ako već postoji pravda u stanju prirode i narod je može razumjeti, svaka vlada je neizbježno podložna istom prirodnom zakonu. Pošto apsolutna moć nad ljudima krši oba ograničenja ovog zakona, odvajanje i distribuiranje je preporučljivo kako bi vlada funkcionirala na odgovarajući način.<br/><br/>Ovaj rad je pokazao da, dok su razlike između Hobbesovih i Lockeovih računa o prirodnom stanju čovječanstva brojne, one u konačnici iznose prisutnosti odsutnosti moralnih prostora. Hobbes gleda na prirodno stanje kao na neograničenu slobodu, gdje se ljudi obdareni jednakim sposobnostima i koji nisu vezani moralnim pojmovima, kao što je pravda, neprekidno natječu za resurse. Locke, međutim, tumači jednakost i slobodu etički, a ne praktično i opines da je rat perverzija prirodnog stanja, jer prirodni zakon obavezuje ljude da ne povrijeđuju jedni druge. Hobbes inzistira na svemoćnom vladaru, jer u nedostatku etičkih ograničenja, nijedan drugi autoritet ne bi mogao prisiliti ljude da se suzdrže od nanošenja štete jedni drugima. - Ipak, po Lockeovom mišljenju, davanje vladinih neograničenih ovlasti bilo bi kontradiktorno etičkim ograničenjima ugrađenim u zakon prirode, zbog čega se on, za razliku od Hobbesa, zalaže za razdvajanje ovlasti. |
| Fashion Police: What Game of Thrones threw up<br/><br/>Canadian-French singer Abbas Hasan put blinding effort to outshine all of humanity at Fashion Parade 2014. Nothing wrong with that, except safety is priority and the musician is a health hazard here.<br/><br/>We get he wants to be a star. Sadly, he didn't get the memo where they tell the desperate and the infamous that stardom is a metaphor. You don't have to look like one and literally set our sight ablaze. Also, the All Pakistan Aunty Association has officially lodged a complaint against him. The local market has run dry of fake crystals and sequined monstrosities. They have nothing to wear to their biweekly high teas and they claim he is to blame. Apparently, the outfit is inspired by Game of Thrones. Can he please stick to composing sad songs about his neighbour's dead dog instead of conceptualising outfits? Or maybe it's the trauma of losing the dog, whose death he is clearly not over as he is still wearing its carcass.<br/><br/>The charge sheet Outfit<br/><br/>No one can decide where the outfit begins and where Abbas ends. You stare in fascination, sinking into a deep abyss and wonder why he is wearing leather pants. Whose horse did he kill to steal the saddle draped across his shoulders? Was he in prison right before his red carpet appearance and forgot to take off the chains? How will he survive the synthetic leather and post-sequin rash that is bound to be lethal in such high dosage? Why am I still alive?<br/><br/>Idea<br/><br/>His inspiration was seemingly Game of Thrones, but he eventually ended up looking like he was thrown out of a Viking restaurant. Had he come across any of the characters from the show, he would've been slain in the first five seconds of the first episode.<br/><br/>The mental health or lack thereof: Someone get him to a counsellor ASAP! He seems to be under the assumption that wearing a dead dog means that the only friend he had in his life is still alive. Dear Abbas:<br/><br/>1. Denial is not a river in Egypt<br/><br/>2. Your tortured psyche is not helping your music, so get help<br/><br/>3. Try imaginary friends<br/><br/>Bail out!<br/><br/>All of us at the Fashion Police headquarters are severely traumatised. Abbas is someone we did not enjoy arresting. He is currently in custody and attempting revenge by putting on attires from other fantasy shows. He just glitter glued himself in order to look like Edward Cullen from Twilight. As a public service message and to prevent further nervous breakdowns, we gave him the following examples of men from the red carpet of the same event.<br/><br/>Zohaib Hassan<br/><br/>When in doubt, play it safe. The singer looks like your average uncle at a shaadi. A plain black suit with no accessories, even if it's a tad disproportionate, is workable. Zohaib's look is blended into everything and nothing, and when you don't have a fashion sense or the money to hire a stylist, this is okay. It does not carry the risk of cardiac arrest for fellow attendees at an event. Given Abbas' delicate mental condition, this look is what he should aim for. Always and forever.<br/><br/>Ali Zafar<br/><br/>One day, after decades of therapy, Abbas could aspire to wear attire like Ali Zafar's. The dapper summer look is done to near perfection. Ali came really close to looking like a maître d at a French restaurant with his white summer jacket with black lapels, but the shirt saves it, never mind the satin. His pants would have been ridiculous had they not been folded at the ankles. The shoes are what hipster chic happy endings are made of. | - Modna policija: Što je igra prijestolja povratila<br/><br/>- Kanadsko-francuski pjevač Abbas Hasan uložio zasljepljujuće napore da zasjeni cijelo čovječanstvo na Modnoj paradi 2014. Ništa loše u tome, osim sigurnosti je prioritet i glazbenik je ovdje zdravstveni rizik.<br/><br/>Nažalost, nije dobio dopis gdje kažu očajnicima i ozloglašenim da je zvjezdanost metafora. Lokalno tržište je presušilo od lažnih kristala i šljokicastih monstruoziteta, nemaju što nositi na dvotjednom čaju i tvrde da je on kriv. Može li se držati skladanja tužnih pjesama o mrtvom psu svog susjeda umjesto konceptualizacije kostima? - Ili možda zbog traume gubitka psa, čiju smrt očito nije završio dok još nosi njegovo truplo.<br/><br/>- Optužba list Odobrenje<br/><br/>Buljiš u fascinaciju, toneš u duboki ponor i pitaš se zašto nosi kožne hlače.

Poricanje nije rijeka u Egiptu<br/><br/>- 2. Vaša mučena psiha ne pomaže vašoj glazbi, pa potražite pomoć.<br/><br/>3. Pokušajte imaginarne prijatelje<br/><br/>- Iskači!<br/><br/>Abbas je netko koga nismo voljeli uhititi, trenutno je u pritvoru i pokušava se osvetiti stavljajući odjeću iz drugih fantasy emisija. Kao poruka javnog servisa i da spriječi daljnje živčane slomove, dali smo mu sljedeće primjere muškaraca s crvenog tepiha istog događaja.<br/><br/>Zohaib Hassan<br/><br/>Pjevač izgleda kao prosječan ujak u Shaadiju, obično crno odijelo bez pribora, čak i ako je malo nerazmjerno, može raditi. Zohaibov izgled je uklopljen u sve i ništa, a kad nemaš smisla za modu ili novac da unajmiš stilistu, to je u redu. - S obzirom na Abbasovo osjetljivo mentalno stanje, ovaj pogled je ono što bi trebao ciljati.<br/><br/>Ali Zafar<br/><br/>Jednog dana, nakon decenija terapije, Abas bi mogao težiti da nosi odeću kao Ali Zafar. Ali je bio blizu da izgleda kao maître d u francuskom restoranu sa svojom bijelom ljetnom jaknom sa crnim reverima, ali košulja je spašava, bez obzira na saten. - Cipele su ono od čega su napravljeni hipsterski šik sretni završeci. |
| Determining soil hydraulic properties with different wetting liquids : A thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the Degree of Master of Science at Lincoln University<br/><br/>Abstract<br/><br/>Soil hydraulic properties such as hydraulic conductivity, water retention and plant water relationships dominate the water movement processes. For example, the infiltration, evaporation and water flow within the soil. As a widespread phenomenon in soil, soil water repellency alters the soil hydraulic functions by resisting the water flow into the soils. Moreover, the hydraulic properties not only depend on the pore system of soil but also are affected by the physicochemical properties of the pore surfaces. Compared to water, ethanol is not affected by the water repellency due to its lower surface tension. The purpose of using ethanol is to eliminate the effect of soil water repellency on hydraulic properties measurements. However, applying pure ethanol into natural soil can degrade the soil organic materials and lead to changes in physical properties. Therefore, the aqueous ethanol solutions can be an alternative option. Nevertheless, the feasibility of using aqueous ethanol for determining soil liquid retention curve remains unknown. This study aims to test the feasibility of the aqueous ethanol solutions (0, 10 %, 20 %, 30 %, 40 %, 50 % and 100 % v/v) for establishing liquid retention curve under a small range of applied pressure in coarse sand samples with different wettability and organic amended natural soil (Templeton silt loam (TSL) with mushroom compost, biochar, dairy effluent, and municipal compost, the application rate was 15 % by weight). The result showed that the desorption of testing aqueous ethanol solutions compared to water was quicker by approximately 1 to 3x based on the liquid content at the same applied pressure and the time for reaching each equilibrium. The outcomes from the sand experiment suggested that when the concentration of aqueous ethanol solution was below 50 %, the losses via evaporation were less than 1% and the relative differences between testing liquid and water was lower than 10 %. However, the evaporation losses were 11.06 % and 24.6 %, and the relative differences were all around 15 % and 30 % in 50 % and 100 % ethanol solution, respectively. In contrast, the organic amendments in Templeton silt loam not only increased the water retention capability but also reduced the evaporation losses. The evaporation losses in TSL soil and TSL with organic amendments soil were with 1 % in solutions with less than 50 % ethanol content. Evaporation losses of 50 % and 100 % ethanol were 2.8 % and 2.9 %, respectively. The relative differences between water and testing liquid were similar to the sand experiment when the testing liquid concentrations were below 50 %. However, the relative differences in 50 % and 100 % ethanol solution were smaller than in the sand sample with around 10 % and 15%, respectively. Additionally, the analysis of relative difference suggested that almost all aqueous ethanol solutions had lower volumetric liquid content at the same supplied pressure compared to water, which was a reflection of the aqueous ethanol solutions desorbed faster than water under equivalent pressure. Therefore, 10 % to 40 % of ethanol solutions could be considered an alternative for determining soil hydraulic properties due to their faster desorption rate and not being affected by soil water repellency. Due to the evaporation and dissolution of organic material, aqueous ethanol solutions above 50% concentration were not suitable for coarse sand or medium-textured soil....

Štoviše, hidraulička svojstva ne samo da ovise o porskom sustavu tla već su pogođena i fizikalnokemijskim svojstvima površina pora. U usporedbi s vodom, etanol nije pogođen odbojnošću vode zbog njegove niže površinske napetosti. Svrha upotrebe etanola je eliminirati učinak odbojnosti vode tla na mjerenja hidrauličkih svojstava. Međutim, primjena čistog etanola u prirodno tlo može degradirati organske materijale tla i dovesti do promjena fizičkih svojstava. Stoga otopina etanola može biti alternativna opcija, ali ipak, mogućnost korištenja etanola za određivanje krivulje zadržavanja tekućine tla ostaje nepoznata. Ova studija ima za cilj testiranje izvodljivosti vodenih otopina etanola (0, 10 %, 20 %, 30 %, 40 %, 50 % i 100 % v/v) za utvrđivanje krivulje zadržavanja tekućine pod malim rasponom primijenjenog tlaka u uzorcima grubog pijeska s različitom vlažnošću i organskom izmijenjenom prirodnom tlu (Templeton silt loam (TSL) s kompostom gljiva, bioharom, mliječnim efluentom i komunalnim kompostom, stopa primjene bila je 15 % po težini). Rezultat je pokazao da je desorpcija otopina za testiranje vodenog etanola u odnosu na vodu bila brža za otprilike 1 do 3x na temelju tekućeg sadržaja pri istom primijenjenom tlaku i vrijeme za postizanje svake ravnoteže. - Ishodi eksperimenta na pijesku sugerirali su da kada je koncentracija otopine etanola bila ispod 50 %, gubici putem isparavanja bili su manji od 1%, a relativne razlike između tekućine za testiranje i vode bile su niže od 10 %. Međutim, gubici isparavanja iznosili su 11,06 % i 24,6 %, a relativne razlike bile su oko 15 % odnosno 30 % u 50 % odnosno 100 % otopini etanola. Za razliku od toga, organski amandmani u Templeton mult loamu ne samo da su povećali sposobnost zadržavanja vode već su smanjili i gubitke isparavanja. Gubici isparavanja u TSL tlu i TSL s organskim izmjenama tla bili su 1 % u rješenjima s manje od 50 % udjela etanola. Gubici evaporacije od 50 % i 100 % etanola bili su 2,8 % odnosno 2,9 %. - Relativne razlike između vode i tekućine za testiranje bile su slične eksperimentu na pijesku kada su koncentracije tekućine u testiranju bile ispod 50 %. Međutim, relativne razlike u 50 %-tnoj i 100 %-tnoj otopini etanola bile su manje nego u uzorku pijeska s oko 10% odnosno 15%. Uz to, analiza relativne razlike sugerirala je da su gotovo sve vodene otopine etanola imale manji sadržaj volumetrijske tekućine pri istom opskrbljenom tlaku u odnosu na vodu, što je bio odraz vodenih otopina etanola koje su se dezorijentirale brže od vode pod ekvivalentnim tlakom. Zbog toga bi se 10 % do 40 % rješenja etanola moglo smatrati alternativom za određivanje hidrauličkih svojstava tla zbog njihove brže stope desorpcije i neutjecanja na odbojnost vode u tlu. Zbog isparavanja i rastavljanja organskog materijala, otopine etanola iznad 50% koncentracije nisu bile pogodne za grubi pijesak ili srednje teksturisano tlo... [Pokaži potpuni sažetak] |
