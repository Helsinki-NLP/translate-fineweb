| Leclaire<br/><br/>The historic Leclaire neighborhood, once referred to as Edwardsville's "suburb to the south," was founded as a cooperative community in 1890 and remained a separate village until annexed to the city of Edwardsville in 1934. Newspapers and magazines throughout the United States and Europe reported on the Leclaire experiment, particularly during the first 20 years of its existence. In 1979, due to its unique history, the former village was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.<br/><br/>Leclaire was founded by Nelson Oliver Nelson, a St. Louis plumbing manufacturer who, for many years, sought to advance the plight of the working class. Nelson wanted to improve working conditions for his employees and provide housing near the factories so workers and their families could easily participate in recreational and educational programs offered free of charge by the company. Prior to 1890, while still in St. Louis, the N. O. Nelson Company's manufacturing and distribution businesses began providing profit sharing along with educational and recreational opportunities. The Leclaire cooperative experiment would bring additional benefits.<br/><br/>When Nelson employees indicated they wanted to relocate to a rural location, company representatives approached leaders of small towns in several Missouri and Illinois communities near their St. Louis headquarters. They were looking for a suitable property to build new factories and a model village. South of Edwardsville they found a 125-acre tract of land with access to water, coal, and transportation. Local businessmen acted quickly to offer a financial incentive. In less than three weeks, the community raised a fund of $20,000 from individual contributions of between $1 and $1,000 to entice Nelson to choose Edwardsville for his enterprise.<br/><br/>City leaders had hoped to locate property inside the city limits of Edwardsville, but when no suitable site could be found, they were confident that the Nelson investment south of town would soon become a part of Edwardsville. Although Nelson fulfilled all the contingencies for construction and job creation in his contract, it would be 44 years before annexation to Edwardsville. Leclaire, bounded by Madison/Brown Avenues to the east, the railroad tracks to the west, Hadley/McKinley Avenues on the south and Wolf Street to the north, remained an independent village from 1890 to 1934. During that time it earned a reputation for innovations in business, education and residential planning.<br/><br/>The village of Leclaire on a 1931 map of Edwardsville<br/>Courtesy of Paul Jenkins<br/><br/>Nelson's decision to build a village was not made on a whim. By the late 1880s he was an international leader in the fields of cooperation and profit-sharing, exchanging social theories with others around the world while expanding his St. Louis business. He named his experimental village after the Parisian profit-sharer, Edme Jean Leclaire, but he visited many other social visionaries who provided information and inspiration. Compiling the best ideas from these examples, Nelson founded Leclaire to, in his words, "give work, promote intelligence, provide recreation, foster beauty, and make homes." These were all factors he determined necessary for men to lead fulfilling lives. Later writers used these words to formulate Leclaire's founding principles: Work, Homes, Education, Recreation, and Beauty, but with the additional important principle of Freedom.<br/><br/>Work<br/><br/>Work could be considered the most important of these factors since without the factory jobs in Leclaire, there would be no village. The brick factory buildings were designed by architect E. A. Cameron to provide natural light, ventilation in the summer, and heated floors in the winter. There was a fire suppression system and, although industrial accidents were not eliminated, every effort was made to guarantee the safety of the workers. The ivy-covered brick buildings were surrounded by well-manicured lawns and flower gardens giving the complex a campus-like appearance. In 1894, New York World reporter Nellie Bly called the buildings "the ideal perfection of buildings for man to labor in".<br/><br/>The manufacturing complex of the N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company in Leclaire<br/>From Friends of Leclaire<br/><br/>Nelson company policies were designed to protect the financial stability of employees. Workers could earn a share of the profits and have a voice in the company if they chose that option. The profit-sharing plan gave Nelson employees a pride of ownership that resulted in a supportive workforce. There were a few short-lived labor strikes over the years, but for the most part, labor problems were rare. Workers also had reasonable hours and competitive wages. There was a provident fund that provided for pensions and sick leave, as well as widow pensions if a worker died, whether or not the death was related to his employment.<br/><br/>Company headquarters for the N. O. Nelson Company (NONCO) remained in St. Louis, but all of the N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company was moved to Leclaire. The manufacturing company was divided into shops that made a variety of products. In 1900, the shops became independent companies for tax purposes, but all were still owned by the N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company. The shops included the Cabinet Mill where wood products from cabinetry to millwork were produced. The skilled craftsmen that worked here also fulfilled special contracts, including teller cages for a local bank and an altar still in use at St. Andrew's Episcopal Church in Edwardsville. The Marble Shop specialized in architectural marble that was cut and installed by Nelson crews in homes, businesses, and even state capitols throughout the Midwest. The Machine Shop, which became Bignall and Keeler, made pipe fitting machines, pumps, gauges, and various mechanical tools expected in the plumbing trade. They also branched out to manufacture specialty items like the Leclaire Bicycle in the mid-1890s. The Brass Shop included a foundry where various plumbing pipes and tools were manufactured. These examples represent just some of the work done in the Leclaire factories. The company's logo was a stylized "NONCO" that can still be seen on plumbing fixtures and some fire hydrants in Edwardsville today.<br/><br/>Homes<br/><br/>Before homes could be built, housing was needed for workers who were completing the factory buildings as well as building homes. To meet those needs, the company built the "Club House," a large building that served many purposes. In addition to lodging, it was the community's first educational building, and it contained a well-stocked library.<br/><br/>Construction of the residential portion of Leclaire began immediately after the village was founded in June of 1890. Julius Pitzman, the innovative landscape architect who laid out the first lots in Leclaire, set them up with a number of protective covenants. The covenants provided for wide, curvilinear streets, large lots, and a deed restriction that limited the properties to residential or educational purposes only. The company paved the streets, provided electric street lights, installed sidewalks, and planted hundreds of trees along the streets of Leclaire. Later sections of Leclaire were laid out with a conventional grid design and smaller lots, but still included the deed restrictions.<br/><br/>A Leclaire Victorian cottage in 1907<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Initially the homes were built by the company and then sold at near cost to Nelson employees to encourage home ownership. If a worker became ill and could not make his mortgage, payments were suspended until after he returned to work. The homes were offered in a variety of house designs and the company advertised that no two dwellings were alike. The earliest homes were primarily Victorian cottages that came with electricity and running water. These were followed by bungalows, foursquares, and even some kit homes. Residents could purchase a company-built home or buy an empty lot and build a house themselves, provided the architectural design met company standards.<br/><br/>In later years, lots were sold to investors, usually Edwardsville residents, and many homes in the 1920s were built by local contractors who then sold them to area residents.<br/><br/>Education<br/><br/>Nelson believed in education for everyone, including the working class. Educational programming began with a kindergarten at the Club House in 1892 and continued in the new educational building at 722 Holyoake Road. Commonly called the "School House," this building provided a large hall for meetings and programs, but had moveable partitions to divide it into classroom space during the day. In the evenings, there were dances, meetings, or programs of the Leclaire Self-Culture Club which featured weekly lectures by Washington University professors or nationally known speakers who, like N. O. Nelson, were part of the social betterment movement at the turn of the century. These included Jane Addams, Edward Everett Hale, Samuel "Golden Rule" Jones, and author Charlotte Perkins Gilman, among others.<br/><br/>Children enrolled in the Leclaire kindergarten in 1913<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>In the ten years following the 1895 construction of the education building, there were a series of educational experiments including an industrial school, college, night school, and an academy. The earliest and longest-lived endeavor was the morning kindergarten, founded in 1892, that used the Fröbel Model. This two-year program was free to everyone, including Edwardsville children, until 1931 when for financial reasons the company began charging tuition to students who were not the children of employees. Nelson Manufacturing operated a kindergarten until 1934 when the building was turned over to the Edwardsville School District for a nominal fee.<br/><br/>Recreation<br/><br/>Boaters on Leclaire Lake in 1915<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Recreation was an important feature of Leclaire. The company provided sports facilities for baseball, tennis, and later, football. A bowling and billiard hall was constructed and there was a lake for boating, swimming, fishing, or ice skating in winter. Leclaire Park was furnished with boathouses, male & female bath houses, and a large pavilion. Residents organized dances, hayrides, spelling bees, and other activities, and the company sponsored a band that played regularly at entertainments in the village or in Edwardsville. Like the educational functions at the Club House and School House, the recreational facilities at Leclaire were open to all and were often a destination for Edwardsville and even St. Louis visitors.<br/><br/>Beauty<br/><br/>Early photograph of Leclaire Lake<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>The last of the factors Nelson deemed important for a satisfying life concerned the environment. Nelson knew about the importance of healthy living. He valued the beauty and cleanliness that could be found in the country, and encouraged all in Leclaire to beautify their property by planting gardens and orchards. Nelson himself led by example, so a company greenhouse provided free flowers and competitions were held for the most beautiful yards. Leclaire was laid out so that the entire village had a park-like setting still evident today.<br/><br/>Freedom<br/><br/>The Leclaire Cooperative store<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Nelson listed five founding principles for Leclaire, but modern writers add a sixth: Freedom. All of the programs offered by the company were available to employees as well as local residents, but none were mandatory. The freedom to choose whether or not to participate in company programs was entirely up to the individual. Residents of Leclaire could work for Nelson Manufacturing or elsewhere, and workers were under no obligation to live in Leclaire. Participation in recreational and educational programs was also optional. There was also a company store where employees could shop, but unlike other company towns, no one was in debt to the company store. The Leclaire Store was a cooperative where members were charged fair market prices, but were then paid quarterly dividends.<br/><br/>A Different Company Town<br/><br/>All of these benefits made Leclaire unique from other company towns. But there were also individual instances where the company showed compassion and care for the employees. The company closed the factories and hired excursion trains to take workers and their families to St. Louis for a day at the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair. When money was tight, Nelson would occasionally place extra cash in each pay envelope to make life easier for workers, and if he instituted a program the men did not agree with, they talked it out and, as often as not, Nelson would reverse himself.<br/><br/>Born in Lillesand, Norway, in 1841, N. O. Nelson was a complicated man. He was a capitalist who believed in free enterprise, but also a socialist, a follower of the "Golden Rule", and a patriot who served for the Union in the Civil War. By 1900, he was a multimillionaire, but by the time of his death in 1922, he had given it all away for the betterment of the working class.<br/><br/>Although Leclaire was not Nelson's only social experiment, it is considered his most successful endeavor. Other major efforts for social betterment included a chain of co-operative grocery stores in New Orleans, a kindergarten for the children of black employees in his Bessemer, Alabama, factories, and a home for consumptives in Indio, California.<br/><br/>Nelson's Village of Leclaire was renowned internationally as a noteworthy and successful experiment. It was described in the New York World on numerous occasions but in particular by reporter Nellie Bly in 1894 who wrote at length about the model town where "The labor question is solved and everybody happy in a little village near St. Louis." The Los Angeles Times also regularly reported on N. O. Nelson, as did the Chicago Daily Tribune and numerous other publications.<br/><br/>In a speech at Leclaire's 15th anniversary celebration in 1915, Nelson said, "Leclaire extends to you a wide open hospitality, and bids you enjoy today the ease and comfort and beauty and inspiration which we enjoy every day." More than a century has passed since that day, but the invitation still stands. Residents and researchers are invited to learn about Leclaire's history and consider the lessons that might be learned for the betterment of future generations.<br/><br/>One of the former buildings of the manufacturing complex in 2019, which now serves as the N. O. Nelson Campus of Lewis and Clark Community College<br/>Photo by Ben Ostermeier<br/><br/>Friends of Leclaire, organized in 1990 following Leclaire's Centennial celebration, promotes the history of Leclaire through a website (historic-leclaire.org), publications, and a festival, Leclaire Parkfest, held annually on the third Sunday in October | \"Leclaire\"<br/><br/>Povijesno susjedstvo Leclaire, koje se nekada nazivalo Edwardsvilleov suburb prema jugu - osnovano je kao zadružna zajednica 1890. godine i ostalo je zasebno selo sve do pripojenja gradu Edwardsvilleu 1934. godine. - Novine i časopisi diljem SAD-a i Europe izvijestili o eksperimentu Leclairea, posebno tijekom prvih 20 godina njegovog postojanja. 1979. godine, zbog svoje jedinstvene povijesti, bivše selo je upisano u Nacionalni registar povijesnih mjesta.<br/><br/>Leclaire je osnovao Nelson Oliver Nelson, proizvođač vodovoda u St. Louisu koji je dugi niz godina nastojao unaprijediti stanje radničke klase. Nelson je želio poboljšati radne uvjete za svoje zaposlenike i osigurati smještaj u blizini tvornica kako bi radnici i njihove obitelji lako mogli sudjelovati u rekreacijskim i obrazovnim programima koje tvrtka besplatno nudi. Prije 1890. godine, dok je još bio u St. Louisu, tvrtka N. O. Nelson kompanija za proizvodnju i distribuciju počela je pružati profitnu podjelu zajedno s obrazovnim i rekreacijskim mogućnostima. Eksperiment Leclaireove zadruge donio bi dodatne pogodnosti.<br/><br/>Kada su zaposlenici Nelsona naznačili da se žele preseliti na seosku lokaciju, predstavnici kompanije približili su se čelnicima malih gradova u nekoliko zajednica Missourija i Illinoisa u blizini sjedišta St. Louisa. Južno od Edwardsvillea pronašli su 125 hektara zemlje s pristupom vodi, ugljenu i transportu. Za manje od tri tjedna zajednica je prikupila fond od 20.000 dolara od pojedinačnih doprinosa između 1 i 1000 dolara kako bi namamila Nelsona da izabere Edwardsville za svoje poduzeće.<br/><br/>Gradski lideri su se nadali da će locirati imovinu unutar gradskih granica Edwardsvillea, ali kada se ne može naći pogodno mjesto, bili su uvjereni da će Nelsonova investicija južno od grada uskoro postati dio Edwardsvillea. - Iako je Nelson ispunio sve nepredviđene mogućnosti za izgradnju i otvaranje radnih mjesta u ugovoru, prošlo bi 44 godine prije aneksije Edwardsvillea. Leclaire, omeđen Madison/Brown Avenijama prema istoku, željezničkom prugom prema zapadu, Hadley/McKinley Avenijama na jugu i Wolfovom ulicom prema sjeveru, ostalo je samostalno selo od 1890. do 1934. godine. Za to vrijeme stekla je reputaciju inovacija u poslovanju, obrazovanju i stambenom planiranju.<br/><br/>) Selo Leclaire na karti Edwardsville iz 1931. godine<br/>- Ljubaznošću Paula Jenkinsa.<br/><br/>Do kasnih 1880-ih bio je međunarodni lider u oblastima suradnje i djeljenja profita, razmjenjujući društvene teorije s drugima diljem svijeta dok je širio svoj posao u St. Louisu. Svoje eksperimentalno selo nazvao je po pariškom profit-shareru Edmeu Jeanu Leclaireu, ali je posjetio mnoge druge socijalne vizionare koji su pružali informacije i inspiraciju. Nelson je osnovao Leclaire kako bi, svojim riječima, dao posao, promicao inteligenciju, pružao rekreaciju, udomljavao ljepotu i stvarao domove. - Kasniji pisci koristili ove riječi da formuliraju Leclaireova načela osnivanja: Rad, Domovi, Obrazovanje, Rekreacija, i Ljepota, ali uz dodatno važno načelo slobode.<br/><br/>\"Posao\"<br/><br/>- Rad bi se mogao smatrati najvažnijim od tih faktora jer bez tvorničkih poslova u Leclaireu, ne bi bilo sela. - Tvornice opeke projektirao arhitekt E. A. Cameron kako bi osigurao prirodno svjetlo, ventilaciju ljeti i grijane podove zimi. - Postojao je sistem suzbijanja požara i, iako industrijske nesreće nisu eliminisane, uloženi su svi napori da se zajamči sigurnost radnika. Zgrade prekrivene bršljanom bile su okružene dobro manikiranim travnjacima i cvjetnim vrtovima dajući kompleksu izgled nalik kampusu. 1894. novinarka New York Worlda Nellie Blay nazvala je zgrade idealnim savršenstvom zgrada u kojima čovjek može raditi.<br/><br/>Proizvodni kompleks N. O. Nelson proizvođačke kompanije u Leclaireu<br/>Od prijatelja Leclairea<br/><br/>Radnici bi mogli zaraditi dio profita i imati glas u kompaniji ako izaberu tu opciju. Plan za podjelu dobiti dao je zaposlenicima Nelsona ponos vlasništva koji je rezultirao potporom radne snage bilo je nekoliko kratkovječnih štrajkova radne snage tijekom godina, ali najvećim dijelom problemi rada su bili rijetki. Radnici su imali i razumne sate i konkurentne plaće. Postojao je providni fond koji je osiguravao mirovine i bolovanje, kao i udovičke penzije ako je radnik umro, bilo da je smrt povezana s njegovim zapošljavanjem.<br/><br/>Sjedište tvrtke za tvrtku N. O. Nelson Company (NONCO) ostalo je u St. Louisu, ali cijela tvrtka N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company premještena je u Leclaire. Proizvodna tvrtka podijeljena je na trgovine koje su proizvodile razne proizvode. 1900. godine trgovine su postale nezavisne kompanije u porezne svrhe, ali su sve još uvijek bile u vlasništvu N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company. Trgovine su uključivale Kabinet Mill gdje su se proizvodili drvni proizvodi od kabineta do mlina. - Vješti obrtnici koji su ovdje radili također su ispunili posebne ugovore, uključujući blagajničke kaveze za lokalnu banku i oltar koji je još uvijek u uporabi u Episkopalnoj crkvi sv. Andrije u Edwardsvilleu. - Marble Shop specijaliziran za arhitektonski mramor koji su rezali i instalirali Nelson posade u domovima, poduzećima, pa čak i državnim kapitolima diljem srednjeg zapada. - Strojarnica, koja je postala Bignall i Keeler, izrađivala je aparate za pričvršćivanje cijevi, pumpe, mjerače i razne mehaničke alate koji se očekuju u vodoinstalaterskoj trgovini. Također su se razgranali za proizvodnju specijalnih predmeta poput Leclaire bicikala sredinom 1890-ih. Brass Shop je uključivao ljevaonicu u kojoj su se proizvodile razne vodovodne cijevi i alati. Logo kompanije bio je stilizirani NONCO koji se još uvijek može vidjeti na vodovodnim učvršćivačima i nekim hidrantima u Edwardsvilleu danas.<br/><br/>Domovi<br/><br/>Prije nego što su se domovi mogli graditi, stanovanje je bilo potrebno za radnike koji su dovršavali tvorničke zgrade kao i gradnju kuća. Uz smještaj, to je bila prva obrazovna zgrada zajednice, a sadržavala je i dobro opskrbljenu knjižnicu.<br/><br/>- Izgradnja stambenog dijela Leclairea započela odmah nakon što je selo osnovano u lipnju 1890. godine. Julius Pitzman, inovativni krajobrazni arhitekt koji je položio prvu parcelu u Leclaireu, postavio im je niz zaštitnih saveza. - Zavjeti su omogućavali široke, zakrivljene ulice, velike parcele i ograničenje djela koje je ograničilo nekretnine samo na stambene ili obrazovne svrhe. Kompanija je popločala ulice, obezbjeđivala električna ulična svjetla, postavljala pločnike i sadila stotine stabala duž ulica Leclairea. - Kasniji dijelovi Leclairea postavljeni su konvencionalnim dizajnom rešetke i manjim parcelama, ali su ipak uključivali restrikcije djela.<br/><br/>Leclaire viktorijanska koliba 1907.<br/>Od Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Ako se radnik razbolio i nije mogao položiti hipoteku, otplate su obustavljene sve dok se nije vratio na posao. Domovi su bili ponuđeni u raznim kućama i kompanija je reklamirala da dva stana nisu ista. Nakon njih slijedili su bungalovi, četiri kvadrata, pa čak i neke kuće za kitove.Stanovnici su mogli kupiti kuću izgrađenu od tvrtke ili kupiti prazno parkiralište i sami izgraditi kuću, pod uvjetom da arhitektonski dizajn ispuni standarde tvrtke.<br/><br/>U kasnijim godinama, lotovi su prodani investitorima, obično stanovnicima Edwardsvillea, a mnoge kuće 1920-ih izgradili su lokalni izvođači radova koji su ih potom prodali stanovnicima područja.<br/><br/>Obrazovanje<br/><br/>Nelson je vjerovao u obrazovanje za sve, uključujući radničku klasu. Obrazovno programiranje počelo je s vrtićem u Klupskoj kući 1892. godine i nastavilo se u novoj edukativnoj zgradi na Holyoake Roadu 722. - Zajedničko zvana Školska kuća - ova zgrada je obezbjeđivala veliku dvoranu za sastanke i programe, ali je imala pokretne particije koje su je tokom dana dijelile na prostor učionica. U večernjim satima bili su plesovi, sastanci ili programi Kluba za samokulturu Leclairea na kojima su se održavala tjedne lekcije profesora Washingtonskog sveučilišta ili nacionalno poznatih govornika koji su, poput N. O. Nelsona, na prijelazu stoljeća bili dio društvenog pokreta za poboljšanje. - Među njima su bili Jane Adams, Edward Everett Hale, Samuel-Zlatno pravilo - Jones, i autor Charlotte Perkins Gilman, između ostalih.<br/><br/>- Djeca upisana u vrtić Leclaire 1913.<br/>Od Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>U deset godina nakon izgradnje obrazovne zgrade 1895. godine održan je niz edukativnih eksperimenata uključujući industrijsku školu, fakultet, noćnu školu i akademiju. Najraniji i najdugovječniji pothvat bio je jutarnji vrtić, osnovan 1892. godine, koji je koristio Fröbelov model. Ovaj dvogodišnji program bio je besplatan za sve, uključujući i djecu Edwardsvillea, sve do 1931. godine kada je iz financijskih razloga tvrtka počela naplaćivati školarinu studentima koji nisu bili djeca zaposlenih. Nelson Manufacturing upravljao je vrtićem sve do 1934. godine kada je zgrada predata školskom okrugu Edwardsville za nominalnu naknadu.<br/><br/>Rekreacija<br/><br/>Nautičari na jezeru Leclaire 1915.<br/>Od Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Kompanija je obezbjeđivala sportske sadržaje za bejzbol, tenis, a kasnije i fudbal. Konstruirana je kuglana i bilijar dvorana i bilo je jezero za plovidbu, plivanje, ribolov ili klizanje zimi. Leclaire Park je bio opremljen kućicama za čamce, muškim i ženskim kupeljima, te velikim paviljonom. - Stanovnici su organizirali plesove, vožnju sijenom, sricanje pčela i druge aktivnosti, a tvrtka je sponzorirala bend koji je redovito svirao na zabavama u selu ili u Edwardsvilleu. - Kao i obrazovne funkcije u Klupskom domu i školskoj kući, rekreacijski sadržaji u Leclaireu bili su otvoreni za sve i često su bili destinacija za Edwardsville, pa čak i za posjetitelje St. Louisa.<br/><br/>- Ljepota.<br/><br/>Rana fotografija jezera Leclaire<br/>Od Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Nelson je znao za važnost zdravog življenja. On je cijenio ljepotu i čistoću koja se mogla naći na selu, i poticao sve u Leclaireu da uljepšaju svoju imovinu sadnjom vrtova i voćnjaka. Sam Nelson je vodio primjerom, tako da je tvrtka staklenik pružala besplatno cvijeće i natjecanja su održana za najljepše jarde. Leclaire je postavljen tako da je cijelo selo imalo postavku nalik parku koja se i danas očituje.<br/><br/>Sloboda<br/><br/>Trgovina zadruge Leclaire<br/>Od Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Nelson je naveo pet osnivačkih principa za Leclaire, ali moderni pisci dodaju šestinu: Slobodu. Svi programi koje je kompanija ponudila bili su dostupni zaposlenicima kao i lokalnim stanovnicima, ali nijedan nije bio obavezan. Sloboda izbora da li ili ne sudjelovati u programima tvrtke u potpunosti ovisi o pojedincu. Stanovnici Leclairea mogli su raditi za Nelsona Manufacturinga ili drugdje, a radnici nisu bili pod obavezom da žive u Leclaireu. Postojala je i radnja tvrtke u kojoj su zaposlenici mogli kupovati, ali za razliku od drugih gradova tvrtke, nitko nije bio u dugovima trgovini. - Trgovina Leclaire je bila zadruga u kojoj su članovima naplaćivane fer tržišne cijene, ali su tada isplaćivane tromjesečne dividende.<br/><br/>Drugačije društvo Grad<br/><br/>Ali bilo je i pojedinačnih slučajeva u kojima je kompanija pokazala suosjećanje i brigu za zaposlenike. Kompanija je zatvorila tvornice i unajmila izletničke vlakove da odvedu radnike i njihove obitelji u St. Louis na jedan dan na Svjetskom sajmu u St. Louisu 1904. Kada je novac bio uzak, Nelson bi povremeno stavio dodatnu gotovinu u svaku kovertu kako bi olakšao život radnicima, a ako bi uveo program s kojim se muškarci nisu slagali, razgovarali bi o tome i, koliko god ne, Nelson bi se sam preokrenuo.<br/><br/>Bio je kapitalist koji je vjerovao u slobodno poduzetništvo, ali i socijalist, sljedbenik Zlatnog pravila i domoljub koji je služio za Uniju u građanskom ratu. Do 1900. godine bio je multimilijunaš, ali do smrti 1922. godine sve je to dao za boljitak radničke klase.<br/><br/>Iako Leclaire nije bio jedini Nelsonov društveni eksperiment, smatra se njegovim najuspješnijim pothvatom. Ostali veliki napori za socijalno poboljšanje uključivali su lanac kooperativnih trgovina u New Orleansu, vrtić za djecu zaposlenih crnaca u njegovom Bessemeru, Alabami, tvornicama, te dom za konzumacije u Indiu, Kalifornija.<br/><br/>Nelsonovo selo Leclaire bilo je međunarodno poznato kao značajan i uspješan eksperiment. Opisana je u New Yorku u brojnim prilikama, ali posebno novinarka Nellie Blay 1894. koja je dugo pisala o modelu grada gdje je riješeno radno pitanje i svi sretni u malom selu u blizini St. Louisa. - Los Angeles Times je također redovito izvještavao o N. O. Nelsonu, kao i Chicago Daily Tribune i brojnim drugim publikacijama.<br/><br/>U govoru na Leclaireovoj proslavi 15. godišnjice 1915. Nelson je rekao: \"Leclaire vam pruža široko otvorenu gostoljubivost, i nudi vam da uživate danas u lakoći, udobnosti i ljepoti i inspiraciji u kojoj uživamo svaki dan.\" Stanovnici i istraživači pozvani su da upoznaju Leclaireovu povijest i uzmu u obzir lekcije koje bi se mogle naučiti za poboljšanje budućih generacija.<br/><br/>- Jedna od bivših zgrada proizvodnog kompleksa 2019. godine, koja sada služi kao N.

| Author Visits via Zoom or Skype<br/><br/>I'm excited to visit with your students via Zoom or Skype! Skype is a great option for schools/classes who aren't bringing in in-person authors, but who want to explore books and poetry, connect with an author, and ask one-on-one questions.<br/><br/>Cost<br/><br/>I offer 30-45-minute Zoom or Skype visits with schools for $125 per session (or $200 for two sessions happening within three hours in the morning or the afternoon; $325 for three sessions in one day; $425 for four sessions in one day). In each session, I try to get kids as actively involved as possible. No, it's not the same kind of connection as an in-person visit offers, but it can still be inspiring and motivating for kids!<br/><br/>What I Do<br/><br/>Each session for up to 50 students includes:<br/><br/>5 minutes of tech set-up<br/><br/>3 segments of 10ish-minutes each — You choose from:<br/><br/>How I became a writer<br/><br/>Writing this particular book (you choose which book I focus on)<br/><br/>Reading (I read some poems and kids help me read others)<br/><br/>Classroom presentation (your students put on a reading or performance for me—a very appreciative audience!)<br/><br/>Writing a poem together<br/><br/>Question and answer session<br/><br/>5 minutes of wrap-ups/goodbyes<br/><br/>I also chat with classes of pre-service teachers or groups of in-service teachers about poetry and writing.<br/><br/>Tips for a Great Virtual Visit<br/><br/>Tips for a Successful Virtual Visit<br/><br/>One of my goals for virtual school visits is to capture the interactivity that makes in-person visits successful and fun. But the truth is that sometimes it's tough to be virtually interactive! The timing might not sync up correctly, which makes reading together a challenge, and it's really hard for me to hear individual students unless they come up and speak directly into the microphone/computer. But after some trial and error, I've discovered some ways to have the best virtual visits possible. Here they are: 10 ways to make my visit with your students a great experience!<br/><br/>Before the Visit<br/><br/>Get kids as excited as possible about the visit. Visit my website with them. Read some of my books with them. Gather some questions students have for me. Anything you do ahead of time to make it feel like a BIG DEAL will go a long way toward student engagement.<br/><br/>Position the video camera or laptop with webcam so that I can see as much of the audience as possible. It's hard to assess student engagement when I can only see a couple of students.<br/><br/>Limit each group to 50 students. It's incredibly hard to engage large groups via video.<br/><br/>I'll move quickly from topic to topic or poem to poem. Please remind students that they'll need to listen closely to understand what's going on.<br/><br/>Occasionally, I do a little Reader's Theater with students. If I send you any scripted student parts ahead of time, print a copy for EACH session and cut into pieces, if needed.<br/><br/>During the Visit<br/><br/>When I discuss a book, if you have that printed book, please hold it up for students to see.<br/><br/>You are my proxy. I often can't call on students and hear individual replies. So, I might say, "We're going to get 3 ideas. Raise your hand if you have an idea." Then YOU take over, call on three students, and announce those answers to everyone in the room and to me.<br/><br/>Choose confident, outgoing students for scripted student parts (if I send any ahead of time). During my in-person school visits, I try to draw out some of the less confident students, but I've found that this doesn't work as well during virtual visits because I can't hear them.<br/><br/>Have students with speaking parts sit up front. When it's time, have them stand up and remind them to speak loudly.<br/><br/>In virtual visits, behavior management falls solely on you. I often can't see exactly what's going on, so do please step in as needed. If there's a big disruption, just ask me to hold on for a moment so that I don't chatter on while nobody's paying attention:>)<br/><br/>Feel free to take pictures of me on-screen and share on social media–even though pictures of me often look ridiculous because I'm making funny faces or something while I read!<br/><br/>If you have any questions at all, please just ask, either before or during the visit!<br/><br/>Scheduling a Virtual Session<br/><br/>Are you interested in scheduling a virtual visit with me? Just email me to set up a date, and we'll go from there | - Autor posjećuje preko Zooma ili Skypea<br/><br/>Skype je odlična opcija za škole/klase koji ne dovode autore koji žele istraživati knjige i poeziju, povezati se s autorom i postavljati pitanja jedan na jedan.<br/><br/>Troškovi<br/><br/>Nudim 30-45-minutnu Zoom ili Skype posjetu školama za 125 dolara po sesiji (ili 200 dolara za dvije sesije koje se odvijaju u roku od tri sata ujutro ili poslijepodne; 325 dolara za tri sesije u jednom danu; 425 dolara za četiri sesije u jednom danu).

Evo ih: 10 načina da moj posjet sa svojim učenicima bude veliko iskustvo!<br/><br/>\"Prije posjete\"<br/><br/>Neka se djeca što više uzbude zbog posjete, posjetite moju web stranicu s njima, pročitajte neke moje knjige s njima i saberite neka pitanja koja učenici imaju za mene. - Sve što radite prije vremena da se osjećate kao da je velika stvar će ići dug put prema studentski angažman.<br/><br/>Teško je procijeniti studentski angažman kada mogu vidjeti samo par studenata.<br/><br/>Teško je uključiti velike grupe preko videa.<br/><br/>Molim vas da podsjetite studente da moraju pažljivo slušati da bi razumjeli što se događa.<br/><br/>-Povremeno radim malo Reader's Theatre sa studentima, ako vam pošaljem neke skriptirane studentske dijelove unaprijed, isprintaj kopiju za svaku sesiju i isjeckaj na komade, ako je potrebno.<br/><br/>Za vrijeme posjeta<br/><br/>Kada budem razgovarao o knjizi, ako imate tu štampanu knjigu, molimo držite je da je učenici vide.<br/><br/>Često ne mogu posjećivati studente i slušati individualne odgovore, pa bih mogao reći, dobit ćemo tri ideje, podignite ruku ako imate ideju. - Onda ti preuzmi, pozovi tri studenta, i objavi te odgovore svima u sobi i meni.<br/><br/>- Izaberite samopouzdane, odlazne studente za skriptovane studentske dijelove (ako pošaljem unaprijed). Tijekom posjeta u školi, pokušavam izvući neke od manje samouvjerenih učenika, ali otkrio sam da ovo ne funkcionira dobro za vrijeme virtualnih posjeta jer ih ne čujem.<br/><br/>Kada dođe vrijeme, neka ustanu i podsjete ih da glasno govore.<br/><br/>U virtualnim posjetama upravljanje ponašanjem pada isključivo na vas. Često ne vidim točno što se događa, pa vas molim da uskočite po potrebi. Ako dođe do velikog poremećaja, samo me zamolite da sačekam na trenutak da ne bih brbljao dok niko ne obraća pažnju:>)<br/><br/>Slobodno me slikajte na ekranu i dijelite na društvenim mrežama, iako moje slike često izgledaju smiješno jer pravim smiješne face ili nešto dok čitam!<br/><br/>- Ako imate bilo kakvih pitanja, samo pitajte, bilo prije ili tijekom posjete!<br/><br/>- Raspored Virtualne sesije<br/><br/>Samo mi pošalji e-mail da odredim datum, i idemo odatle. |

On the one hand it has prompted stigma and violence and on the other it has brought about constructive and supportive responses from various individuals and groups. A new book, Acting on HIV, edited by Prof. Dennis Francis, Dean of the Faculty of Education at the University of the Free State, looks at how drama can be used to promote vital social change as well as individual behavioural change.<br/><br/>Acting on HIV offers a systematic inquiry into drama as an approach to discuss HIV/AIDS and related attitudes and behaviours. The book is a scholarly text and includes the work of some twenty exceptionally creative authors. Contributing authors to the book include, amongst others, Proff. Hazel Barnes (University of the Witwatersrand), Rob Pattman (Stellenbosch University) and Yvonne Sliep from the University of KwaZulu-Natal.<br/><br/>"This project started in 2009 and has taken much of my time to bring together the work of exceptionally creative authors. The research that is communicated through the book is original and timely and makes a significant contribution to conversations about the role/s and significance of drama in addressing issues of HIV & AIDS," says Prof. Francis | Arhiva vijesti<br/><br/>Nova knjiga gleda načine na koje se treba boriti protiv HIV izazova<br/><br/>2011.-11-29.<br/><br/>- Prof. Dennis Francis s Marjorie Human koja je osmislila naslovnicu knjige, Djelujući na HIV-u.<br/><br/>Pandemija HIV-a izvukla je najbolje i najgore kod ljudi u smislu odgovora.

| Storyworld Spotlight<br/><br/>25 years of Tomb Raider<br/><br/>Tomb Raider is one of the most recognizable entertainment properties in the world. Since Lara Croft's first videogame appearance in Tomb Raider (1996), her exploits as an adventurous and quick-witted explorer have resonated widely with players, earning her a place in the pantheon of great pop culture characters. For that reason we will be putting The World of Lara Croft in the Storyworld Spotlight from December 22, 2021 to March 6, 2022.<br/><br/>Crafting a Croft<br/><br/>Lara Croft was created by studio Core Design, in Derby (UK), in 1996. The studio was looking for a lead character for their upcoming a 3D adventure game for PlayStation 1. A game in a 3rd person perspective where players would see the main character in full throughout every scene.<br/><br/>As the game was about 'raiding mysterious tombs deep under pyramids,' the lead character would need to look adventurous, and have the brains to survive complex raiding missions. After some deliberation, Lara Croft was born, a young, upper-class and utterly British woman, who was as enigmatic and intelligent as she was tough and self-reliant.<br/><br/>Success and controversy<br/><br/>Tomb Raider (1996) was a breakaway success for Core Design, who quickly doubled down on building Tomb Raider 2 (1997) and 3 (1998). A big part of the success was attributed to the games' leading lady, who found admirers both with male and female players. This baffled critics who just saw Lara Croft as a sexist cartoon.<br/><br/>Explore The World of Lara Croft in Storyworld<br/><br/>This exhibition explores the successful franchise in-depth. It looks at the history of the games and why its leading lady resonates with so many people. It also dives into the mystery of what makes Tomb Raider games tick, from the deep world building to the clever puzzles and traps, and from fantastic enemy and monster designs to the character design of the legendary heroine.<br/><br/>After all, mysteries are there to explore, and have been for the past 25 years.<br/><br/>Tickets<br/><br/>Buy your tickets for Storyworld online with a start date and entry time from Wednesday December 22.

| Real Estate Word of the Day: Option<br/><br/>Option: An agreement to keep open, for a set period, an offer to sell or lease real property. An option can be used, for example, to give the buyer time to resolve questions of financing, title, zoning and feasibility before committing the buyer to purchase. Options are frequently used in the land assemblage process. The option must be supported by its actual consideration, separate and independent of the purchase price of the property. Mere recital of consideration alone is not sufficient except in a lease-option in which the provisions of the lease are themselves sufficient consideration to support the option. An option merely creates a contractual right; it does not give the optionee any estate in the property. At the time the option is signed, the owner does not sell, nor does the buyer purchase, the property. Although the owner is obligated to sell if given notice by the buyer, the buyer is not obligated to purchase. An option to buy is also known as a call; an option to sell is known as a put. | - Riječ o nekretninama dana: Opcija<br/><br/>Opcija: Sporazum o održavanju otvorenog, u određenom periodu, ponuda za prodaju ili zakup nekretnine. Opcija se može koristiti, na primjer, kako bi kupcu dalo vremena za rješavanje pitanja financiranja, naslova, zoniranja i izvedivosti prije nego se kupac obveza na kupnju. Opcije se često koriste u procesu kopnenog okupljanja. Opcija mora biti podržana njenim stvarnim razmatranjem, odvojenim i nezavisnim od kupoprodajne cijene imovine. - Samo recital razmatranja nije dovoljan osim u opciji najma u kojoj su odredbe zakupa dovoljne za podršku opciji. Opcija samo stvara ugovorno pravo; ne daje opcijama nikakvo imanje u zemljištu.U trenutku kada je opcija potpisana, vlasnik ne prodaje, niti kupac kupuje, imanje. - Iako je vlasnik dužan da proda ako mu kupac da otkaz, kupac nije obavezan da kupi. Opcija kupovine je poznata i kao poziv; opcija prodaje je poznata kao put. |
| Benefits of Carotenoids for the Skin<br/><br/>Have you heard of carotenoids? These powerful phytochemicals are the pigmented constituents found in plants that give flowers, fruits, and leaves their yellow, orange and red colours.<br/><br/>Since the 1930s, scientists have identified about 800 carotenoids and about 40 are found in the human body, including the outermost layer of the epidermis, the dermis and subcutaneous fat. The most common carotenoids are beta-carotene, alpha-carotene, lutein, zeaxanthin, lycopene, and astaxanthin. You can read more about astaxanthin here.<br/><br/>The content of carotenoids in the skin is influenced by numerous factors, including the intake of fruits and vegetables, their bioavailability from various foods, supplementation, exposure to UV radiation, air pollution, alcohol consumption, smoking and stress.<br/><br/>How do Carotenoids Help My Skin?<br/><br/>Carotenoids are some of the best-known antioxidants for the skin and they also have important functions as anti-inflammatory agents.<br/><br/>Healthy Aging and Skin Repair<br/><br/>Antioxidants are essential for healthy skin because they help to prevent free radical damage to cells. Free radical damage causes premature aging and the onset of various types of skin cancers. Carotenoids, along with vitamin E, vitamin C, and Co enzyme Q10 are important dermal antioxidants.<br/><br/>Due to their antioxidant activity, carotenoids support and encourage collagen and elastin production in the skin. This helps to increase the skin's density, thickness, elasticity, and firmness. Collagen and elastin decrease as we age, so getting enough carotenoids in the diet and topically is critical for aging well.<br/><br/>Carotenoids can improve the signs of photoaging, skin discolouration, elasticity, hydration, texture, and can reduce transepidermal water loss.<br/><br/>Astaxanthin in particular stimulates fibroblasts to produce collagen and elastin, inhibits the activity of the enzymes that breakdown collagen and elastin, and shows anti-inflammatory and UV-filtering effects. It has been shown to reduce melanin in the skin, which results in the decrease in the appearance of freckles and melasma.<br/><br/>Anti-acne activity: the anti-inflammatory activity of carotenoids helps to dampen the inflammation and irritation associated with acne. Carotenoids also help to normalize and balance oil secretions from the sebaceous glands. They are valuable agents in skin repair and they stimulate epidermal regeneration, helping to smooth and soften skin.<br/><br/>Where Can I Find Carotenoids?<br/><br/>There are two ways to get your daily dose of carotenoids: through diet and through topical application. The combination of both is the ideal approach to well-aging skincare.<br/><br/>Carotenoids are fat-soluble, so your body needs fat to absorb them (think tomatoes and olive oil, broccoli and butter, or spinach and avocado). Common sources of carotenoids in food are avocado, egg yolks, kale, spinach, carrots, sweet potatoes, papaya, and tomatoes.<br/><br/>While we advocate getting as many of your nutrients and antioxidants as you can from food rather than supplementation; one study showed that astaxanthin combined with collagen hydrolysate significantly improved barrier integrity, reduced transepidermal water loss, and increased the expression of procollagen type I mRNA.<br/><br/>Topical application is key to healthy skin. Studies show that high concentrations of antioxidants in human skin offer the best protection for healthy skin at any age.<br/><br/>At Sarka Botanicals, we blend carotenoid-rich, whole plants such as calendula, dandelion, and extracts like astaxanthin with cold-pressed oils and functional ingredients. Calendula alone contains over 19 different types of carotenoids. This may explain why it has such a long history of use in skin care. Studies show that carotenoids blended with co-enzyme Q10 are especially effective at reducing inflammation and slowing premature skin aging due to sun exposure. | Prednosti karotenoida za kožu<br/><br/>Ove snažne fitokemije su pigmentirani sastojci koji se nalaze u biljkama koje daju cvijeće, voće i ostavljaju žutu, narančastu i crvenu boju.<br/><br/>Od 1930-ih, znanstvenici su identificirali oko 800 karotenoida i oko 40 ih je pronađeno u ljudskom tijelu, uključujući i najudaljeniji sloj epiderme, dermis i potkožnu mast. Najčešći karotenoidi su beta-karoten, alfa-karoten, lutein, zeaksantin, likopen i astaksantin.<br/><br/>Na sadržaj karotenoida u koži utječu brojni faktori, uključujući unos voća i povrća, njihovu bioraspoloživost iz raznih namirnica, dopunu, izloženost UV zračenju, onečišćenje zraka, konzumaciju alkohola, pušenje i stres.<br/><br/>Kako karotenoidi pomažu mojoj koži?<br/><br/>- Karotenoidi su neki od najpoznatijih antioksidansa za kožu i također imaju važne funkcije kao protuupalni agensi.<br/><br/>ZDRAVLJE STARAC I POPRAVKA KOŽE<br/><br/>Antioksidansi su neophodni za zdravu kožu jer pomažu u sprečavanju slobodnih radikalnih oštećenja stanica. slobodna radikalna oštećenja uzrokuju prerano starenje i pojavu raznih vrsta raka kože. - Karotenoidi, zajedno s vitaminom E, vitaminom C i Co enzimom Q10 važni su dermalni antioksidansi.<br/><br/>Zbog njihove antioksidativne aktivnosti karotenoidi podržavaju i potiču proizvodnju kolagena i elastina u koži, što pomaže povećanju gustoće kože, debljine, elastičnosti i čvrstoće. Collagen i elastin se smanjuju kako starimo, pa je dobivanje dovoljno karotenoida u prehrani i topički kritično za dobro starenje.<br/><br/>- Karotenoidi mogu poboljšati znakove fotoagiranja, promjene boje kože, elastičnosti, hidratacije, teksture i smanjiti gubitak transepidermalne vode.<br/><br/>- Astaksantin posebno stimulira fibroblaste da proizvode kolagen i elastin, inhibira aktivnost enzima koji razgrađuju kolagen i elastin, te pokazuje protuupalne i UV-filtrirane efekte. Pokazalo se da smanjuje melanin u koži, što rezultira smanjenjem izgleda pjegica i melazme.<br/><br/>Antiakne aktivnosti: protuupalna aktivnost karotenoida pomaže pri prigušivanju upale i iritacije povezane s aknama. karotenoidi također pomažu u normalizaciji i ravnoteži lučenja ulja iz sebaceoznih žlijezda. Oni su vrijedni agensi za popravak kože i stimuliraju epidermalnu regeneraciju, pomažu glatku i omekšavaju kožu.<br/><br/>Gdje mogu naći karotenoide?<br/><br/>Postoje dva načina da dobijete dnevnu dozu karotenoida: putem prehrane i kroz topikalnu primjenu. Kombinacija oba je idealan pristup dobro starenju kože.<br/><br/>- Karotenoidi su topivi u masti, tako da vaše tijelo treba masnoće da ih apsorbira (misli rajčica i maslinovo ulje, brokula i maslac, ili špinat i avokado). - Zajednički izvori karotenoida u hrani su avokado, žumance od jaja, kelj, špinat, mrkva, slatki krumpir, papaja i paradajz.<br/><br/>- Dok se zalažemo za dobivanje što više vaših hranjivih tvari i antioksidansa što više možete od hrane, a ne dodataka; jedna studija pokazala je da je astaksantin u kombinaciji s hidrolizatom kolagena značajno poboljšao integritet barijere, smanjio gubitak transepidermalne vode i povećao ekspresiju prokollagena tipa I mRNK.<br/><br/>Studije pokazuju da visoke koncentracije antioksidansa u ljudskoj koži pružaju najbolju zaštitu za zdravu kožu u bilo kojoj dobi.<br/><br/>U Sarki Botaničari miješamo karotenoid bogate, cijele biljke kao što su kalendula, maslačak i ekstrakti poput astaksantina s hladnim prešanim uljima i funkcionalnim sastojcima. Kalendula samo sadrži preko 19 različitih vrsta karotenoida. Studije pokazuju da su karotenoidi pomiješani s koenzimom Q10 posebno djelotvorni u smanjenju upale i usporavanju preranog starenja kože zbog izlaganja suncu. |
