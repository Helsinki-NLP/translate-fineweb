| Quidditch through the ages<br/><br/>I was doodling some quidditch-related objects like broomsticks and snitches and whatnot and it sort of turned into this odd compilation of things, including Harry down there at the bottom. I am not completely satisfied with the way it came out, but since it's not bad for my second Harry Potter fan-art picture, I decided to color it anyway. If you are wondering where his scar is, it's there, but it's very very light and small because I did that bit on the computer. Sketched in pen, colored in Paint. | \"Kvidič kroz vekove\"<br/><br/>-Krepao sam neke predmete povezane s metlama i cinkarošima i slično i to se pretvorilo u neobičnu kompilaciju stvari, uključujući Harryja dolje na dnu. Nisam potpuno zadovoljan načinom na koji je izašao, ali pošto nije loše za moju drugu sliku fan-umjetnosti Harry Pottera, odlučio sam je obojati u svakom slučaju. Ako se pitate gdje mu je ožiljak, tu je, ali je vrlo lagan i malen jer sam to napravio na računalu. |

| If you were admitted and enrolled --> yes If you were admitted and attended another school --> yes If you took extension courses (do they even have them there? I know UCLA does) --> yes If you went to graduate school there --> yes<br/><br/>That's my interpretation because any of these scenarios would fulfill either being "admitted to an undergraduate program" or "taking courses" at UC Berkeley. I could be completely wrong though, you're better off just calling them and clarifying your specific situation.<br/><br/>My opinion: Based on the wording, I interpreted it as asking if you were admitted to Berkeley undergrad, whether or not you chose to attend. If it meant admitted and attended, they could easily have seen that through the "Undergrad Institutions" portion of the application. | - Ako ste primljeni i upisani -->da Ako ste primljeni i pohađali drugu školu -->da Ako ste pohađali produžene tečajeve (da li ih uopće imaju tamo?<br/><br/>To je moja interpretacija jer bi bilo koji od ovih scenarija ispunio bilo koji od tih scenarija koji bi bio dodijeljen preddiplomskom programu ili bi pohađao tečajeve na UC Berkeleyu. Mogu biti potpuno u krivu, bolje ti je da ih nazoveš i pojasniš svoju situaciju.<br/><br/>- Moje mišljenje: na osnovu teksta, protumačio sam to kao pitanje da li ste primljeni na Berkeley undergrad, da li ste ili ne izabrali da prisustvujete. Ako je to značilo da su primljeni i prisustvovali, mogli su to lako vidjeti kroz \"Undergrad Institucije\" dio prijave. |

| Winter Protection for Fig Trees<br/><br/>Report This Article<br/><br/>Winter Protection for Fig Trees<br/><br/>Overview<br/><br/>The fig tree has been around since at least 5,000 B.C., and is grown throughout the world for its delicious fruit. Figs grow well in a mild climate without weather extremes. The fig tree is now propagated in some areas with harsh winters. Protective precautions are required to save the tree from winter damage.<br/><br/>Potted Fig Trees<br/><br/>Ornamental fig trees in pots can stand some freezing and do not require light once they enter the winter dormancy phase. Avoid extreme swings in temperature by placing the fig tree in a controlled environment such as a garage, where temperatures range between slightly under freezing and slight above. The plant should be watered as the soil dries.<br/><br/>Shielding<br/><br/>Shielding to protect the tree from the most extreme winter weather is required. Fig trees require placement in soil areas where the soil does not freeze to protect it from disease and increase its chances of winter survival. Large screens placed around the tree protects it from winter winds that can damage and freeze the wood.<br/><br/>Wrapping<br/><br/>Tree wrapping protects the tree from cold weather and prevents hard winds from destroying the branches. Fig tree wrapping should be applied once the leaves from the tree have fallen to prevent leaves from rotting inside the wrapping material. Fig trees are sensitive to slight temperature changes. It can not warm up inside the protective film or else the tree may begin to grow, making it susceptible to severe damage during the cold snap.<br/><br/>Planting<br/><br/>Cultivar practices help to protect the fig tree during harsh winters. Varieties that are resistant to cold weather are best for locations where the weathers are harsh. Brown Turkey, Brunswick and Blue Celeste are good cultivars for cold weather. Planting should be done against a wall or structure that will radiate heat towards the tree during the winter months.<br/><br/>Snow<br/><br/>Roots of the fig tree require dry soil during the winter dormancy period. Watering should be done only when the soil is dry and the roots should be protected from melting snow and rain. Protection placed on the ground under the tree, near the trunk--to keep water from draining into the soil--protects the tree from damage.<br/><br/>Keywords:<br/>fig tree protection, fig tree winter, fig tree care | Zimska zaštita za smokve<br/><br/>Prijavite ovaj članak<br/><br/>Zimska zaštita za smokve<br/><br/>Pregled<br/><br/>Smokva postoji još od 5000. pr.

| Oculus CEO comes down hard on Mac support for the Rift<br/><br/>Oculus CEO, Palmer Luckey, has not minced his words when asked in an interview whether the Rift VR headset will ever support the Mac. If you had any hopes of it being soon, you might want to ready yourselves for some disappointment.<br/><br/>That is up to Apple. If they ever release a good computer, we will do it.<br/><br/>What he's referring to there in a less diplomatic sense is the discrete graphics required to run the Rift. The simple truth is that Apple just doesn't go for high-end graphics that will meet the requirements for the headset. For context, on a Windows PC, you need a minimum of an NVIDIA GTX 970, a $300 graphics card.<br/><br/>As Luckey went on to say:<br/><br/>It just boils down to the fact that Apple doesn't prioritize high-end GPUs. You can buy a $6,000 Mac Pro with the top of the line AMD FirePro D700, and it still doesn't match our recommended specs. So if they prioritize higher-end GPUs like they used to for a while back in the day, we'd love to support Mac. But right now, there's just not a single machine out there that supports it.<br/><br/>The Mac Pro can't be accused of not packing plenty of horsepower, because it does, but equally FirePro graphics are targeted more towards the creative market, just like the Mac Pro. The Mac Pro in particular far exceeds other hardware requirements, but naturally as the Rift is graphics heavy, this is where the shortfall is. Luckey is perhaps being a little over the top, but equally he's the man behind the Rift, so there's no doubts plenty of truth to what he says. Even if he doesn't say it particularly well.<br/><br/>What say you, Mac owners of the world? Are you even bothered about the Oculus Rift or is it something you wish you could have? Sound off in the comments below!<br/><br/>Reader comments<br/><br/>Oculus CEO comes down hard on Mac support for the Rift<br/><br/>No, not bothered by it since I really wasn't planning on buying an Oculus Rift. For me the product category is still too early and too much in a beta-kinda phase. But he does rise a valid point. Apple should try to get more ahead of the pack CPU/GPU wise. Right now they're always trailing behind.<br/><br/>Excuse me, but what is HTC Vive better at? And Oculus Rift most certainly supports Linux machines that meet their hardware specifications! (The issue is not OS but hardware.)<br/><br/>Also, look at WHY the HTC Vive supports OS X: it includes more of its own hardware. (Which is why it costs so much.) The Oculus solutions - both the Rift and the Samsung Gear VR - require the hardware that it is plugging into to perform more of the heavy lifting.<br/><br/>VR isn't a gimmick. 3D TVs don't always give that much of a 3d effect, and it doesn't work with everyone. VR works with everyone, and the Oculus and HTC Vive official release products have almost no latency so there shoudn't be any motion sickness. There's also plenty of game support<br/><br/>Obviously if gaming is a priority you're generally not in the market for a Mac, though. Not many game developers support OSX so these types of devices likely have limited use on a Mac (for gaming, anyways, which the Rift was designed for). At least that's the only reason I could see myself using one. I definitely wouldn't use it for watching movies.<br/><br/>Apple did implement the Metal engine into El Capitan, there might be some plan to go into the gaming market (as Apple learned from iOS how big this market is, just look at the top grossing apps).<br/>So now the hardware is missing and and game devs would probably show some interest, since Macs there are now an acceptable amount of Mac users around the world.<br/><br/>I would like to see Apple make its way into that sector of the industry. I don't use any Apple products presently but they're making a lot of the right moves in many areas and I'm very intrigued.<br/><br/>Plus, competition fuels innovation. I know that major computer part manufactures already create that competition but Apple has the RnD willpower and the cash to really turn heads. They may not win the numbers games in terms of specs, they actually rarely do, but most people who care to do the research know that performance != the sum of the device's parts. Apple can do more with "less". On paper their products appear inferior but when carefully balanced hardware meets specifically engineered software they generally perform just as well as the competition if not out perform.<br/><br/>HA! I love how, all of a sudden, having a high performance computer is not important to Apple phans! There is not a single Mac capable of the highest end graphics. Can't buy one, can't build one. Mac is not capable of being the highest in performance and you are good with that. HA! Classic!<br/><br/>I bought my MacBook Pro Retina in 2012 because of the high resolution screen and the non-discrete GPU. However, for my desktop I built a system with a 4K monitor, i7 4790K CPU, 3 GTX 970 GPU's, and 16 gb of memory all for less than what I'd pay for an iMac. I even have an SSD set up to boot in OSX. My point is Apple could do similar things if it wished, but doesn't. In fact, look at the most recent iMac. It includes discrete graphics and a slow 5400 RPM drive. My computer may not look as pretty, and it's not as thin, but in the end it's more useful - isn't that why we buy a computer in the first place?<br/><br/>I don't see why a Mac pro can not make use of the Oculus isn't it built for rendering video. I understand that it will not be able to run on iMac's and because of this the Oculus should be branded for Pro users due to the requirements and come at the price.<br/><br/>Now people are saying that your computer is doing ALL the heavy lifting, so why is the price point over $800 for something that isn't doing anything?<br/><br/>I'm excited about the direction of VR but not where it is at the moment.<br/><br/>Your display (which the Rift is) never does any of the heavy lifting. It's $800 because of what the display does; 110° viewing angle (still not human eye but much closer than other displays) with super low latency to reduce or eliminate motion sickness on a 1200x1800 per eye display for HD quality.<br/><br/>And yes, Mac's are very widely used for video rendering, but that rendering doesn't happen at 30+fps. It can take video rendering machines hours to render a single frame and sometimes years to render an entire movie. The final products, or pre-rendered material, is what then becomes 30+fps.<br/><br/>Thank you @TheRealFixxer<br/>Alot of what you say makes sense and some I was unaware of.<br/><br/>I guess I don't see VR as a game, but as an immersion and seeing Mac's are good at 3dcad and compiling video I would think they would be able to compile a scene well. I've even seen 3d renders of movie walk through. Creating a 3d world and placing cameras in areas to figure out how a scene would look<br/><br/>But I agree Mac's make more use of CPU cycles even by using there GPU's to help. WIth that said there are other directions one could take it. Like external thunderbolt video cards.<br/><br/>My big grip is the fact Octulas is looked at as a consumer product. If the requirements are that high, then it's more a pro product and needs to be advertized as that. I understand the technology is there but don't feel it's there to call it a consumer product.<br/><br/>Yes, you are right. Apple also has issues with software. Most aren't using "metal" the apple programming language which speeds up the processing for games because it's an Apple only solution where many use game engines that work on Microsoft Direct X or open source Opengl which most games use to run on Linux and oSX. Opengl is around 20% slower and sometime a lot more than that compared to direct x so a top of the line gaming card running in oSX runs as fast is a mid level gaming card in windows. So big problems not to mention most macs have built in cards that have no upgradability.<br/><br/>The mac pro is so different that Apple would have to do this as it wouldn't be worth a card vendor doing this as there is no profit in it for them with the small amount of possible buyers there would be for this. Apple doesn't like to loose money so I don't see this ever happening. Apple would loose money offering video card upgrades for mac pros.<br/><br/>Well he has a point though I do t care about oculus rift, rather wait for starVR. There should be an option to add better GPUs into an iMac and MacBook Pro. It is also sad that there is no more nVidia card, I liked the CUDA support now I will have to buy a PC and install Linux for my CUDA projects.<br/><br/>Gaming is a growing market and it won't be long until even iPhones have more GPU performance than the Macs. I agree that Apple should offer a high end GPU in a Mac<br/><br/>I am very bothered by the lack of high performance discrete graphics on Mac computers. Even the top of the like iMac uses an out of date mobile GPU which, of course, cannot be upgraded. If I want to develop software for VR, Apple has left me no choice but to buy or build a PC to run it on. As a big Apple fan (yes I admit it) this make me rather sad.<br/><br/>BTW, VR is not some passing fad. If you have tried it you know what I mean. VR is going to change gaming and content creation forever. My only worry about VR is that is too good. There could be millions of people that will become addicted to living and playing in virtual worlds. Look at how many people got addicted to MMOs that played on a flat screen. With VR you really feel like you are in the game.<br/><br/>Not worried about anything, i am pretty sure apple will have its own implementation for Mac and iOS when tech will be ready for consumers, right now it is more for hardcore users. Like always apple like to time its presence on right time, with right product. Have faith in apple.<br/><br/>It's funny that a lot of people know which vr is better based on os support. I guess you guys did heavy testing and now are the guy in the big electronic store that knows best.<br/><br/>HTC said it will bring support to the osx but that still needs to be seen.<br/><br/>I understand that a lot of you guys are stamped on there d**ks. But understand that Apple is more focused on laptops. And laptops can't be packed with more power than a PC, due to size, heat, power consumption etc.<br/><br/>He is right, even though he put it in **** terms. I love my Mac but Lord it needs a boost in graphics. Not that it needs to cost more but I would be more than willing to pay a little extra for a better graphics card or at least have the option to install my own. It's really too bad this guy had to make his statement sound like he is just plain uneducated. | CEO Oculusa teško je pridobiti Macovu podršku za procjep.<br/><br/>Direktor Oculusa, Palmer Luckey, nije izbrisao svoje riječi kada ga je upitao u intervjuu da li će slušalice \"Rift VR\" ikada podržati Maca, ako ste se nadali da će to uskoro biti, možda biste se željeli pripremiti za neko razočaranje.<br/><br/>Ako ikada puste dobar kompjuter, uradićemo to.<br/><br/>-Ono na šta on tamo misli u manje diplomatskom smislu je diskretna grafika potrebna za pokretanje procjepa. Jednostavna istina je da Apple jednostavno ne ide za vrhunsku grafiku koja će zadovoljiti zahtjeve za slušalice. Za kontekst, na Windows PC-u, potreban vam je minimum NVIDIA GTX 970, grafička kartica od 300 dolara.<br/><br/>Luckey je nastavio govoriti:<br/><br/>To se svodi samo na činjenicu da Apple nema prioritete za vrhunske GPU-ove, možete kupiti 6000 $ Mac Pro sa vrhom linije AMD FirePro D700, i još uvijek ne odgovara našim preporučenim specifikacijama. Ako imaju prioritete u višim GPU-ovima kao nekada, voljeli bismo podržati Maca, ali trenutno nema nijednog stroja koji ga podržava.<br/><br/>Mac Pro se ne može optužiti da nema dovoljno konjskih snaga, jer ima, ali jednako tako FirePro grafika je ciljana više prema kreativnom tržištu, baš kao i Mac Pro. - Mac Pro posebno daleko premašuje druge hardverske zahtjeve, ali prirodno, kako je pukotina teška grafika, ovdje je manjak. Luckey je možda malo pretjerao, ali jednako tako i on stoji iza procjepa, tako da nema sumnje puno istine u ono što kaže, čak i ako to ne kaže posebno dobro.<br/><br/>Jeste li se uopće zabrinuli za Oculus rascjep ili nešto što biste željeli imati?<br/><br/>Komentari čitalaca<br/><br/>CEO Oculusa teško je pridobiti Macovu podršku za procjep.<br/><br/>Za mene je kategorija proizvoda još uvijek prerano i previše u fazi beta-kinde, ali on se diže na valjanu točku, Apple bi trebao pokušati biti bolji od CPU/GPU-a. - Sada uvijek zaostaju.<br/><br/>Oculus Rift zasigurno podržava Linux strojeve koji ispunjavaju njihove specifikacije hardvera! (Izdanje nije OS nego hardver.)<br/><br/>- Također, pogledajte zašto HTC Vive podržava OS X: uključuje više vlastitog hardvera. (Zato i košta toliko.) - Oculus rješenja - i procjep i Samsung Gear VR - zahtijevaju hardver u koji se priključuje kako bi se obavilo više teškog dizanja.<br/><br/>3D televizori ne daju uvijek toliko 3D efekta, i to ne radi sa svima. VR radi sa svima, a Oculus i HTC Vive službeni proizvodi za puštanje gotovo da nemaju latenciju tako da ne bi trebalo biti bolesti kretanja. Ima i dosta podrške za igru.<br/><br/>Očigledno, ako je igranje prioritet, generalno niste na tržištu za Mac, iako nema mnogo programera koji podržavaju OSX tako da ovi tipovi uređaja vjerojatno imaju ograničenu upotrebu na Mac (za igre, ionako, za koje je Rift dizajniran). Ne bih ga koristio za gledanje filmova.<br/><br/>Apple je implementirao metalni motor u El Capitan, možda postoji neki plan za ulazak na tržište igara (kao što je Apple saznao iz iOS-a koliko je veliko ovo tržište, samo pogledajte vrhunske aplikacije za zgrušavanje).<br/>Dakle, sada nedostaje hardver i devs bi vjerojatno pokazao zanimanje, pošto Macovi sada postoje prihvatljiva količina korisnika Maca širom svijeta.<br/><br/>Ne koristim nikakve Apple proizvode trenutno, ali oni čine puno pravih poteza u mnogim područjima i jako sam zaintrigiran.<br/><br/>Znam da glavni računalni dio već proizvodi to natjecanje, ali Apple ima snagu volje i novac da stvarno okrene glave. Oni ne mogu pobijediti u igrama brojeva u smislu specifikacija, oni zapravo rijetko rade, ali većina ljudi koji žele napraviti istraživanje znaju da performanse ! = zbroj dijelova uređaja. Apple može učiniti više s -manje. Na papiru njihovi proizvodi izgledaju inferiorni, ali kada se pažljivo izbalansirani hardver susreće posebno dizajnirani softver oni generalno izvode jednako dobro kao i konkurencija ako ne i van izvode.<br/><br/>Ne postoji ni jedan Mac koji je sposoban za najvišu grafiku, ne može ga kupiti, ne može ga izgraditi. Mac nije sposoban biti najviši u izvedbi i ti si dobar u tome.<br/><br/>Kupio sam svoj MacBook Pro Retina 2012. zbog ekrana visoke rezolucije i nediskretnog GPU-a, ali za svoju radnu površinu izgradio sam sustav s 4K monitorom, i7 4790K CPU, 3 GTX 970 GPU-a, i 16 gb memorije sve za manje od onoga što bih platio za iMac. Imam i SSD postavljen u OSX-u, poanta je da bi Apple mogao raditi slične stvari ako želi, ali ne želi. - Moje računalo možda ne izgleda tako lijepo, i nije tako tanko, ali na kraju je korisnije - nije li to razlog zašto uopće kupujemo računalo?<br/><br/>Ne vidim zašto Macpro ne može iskoristiti Oculus nije li napravljen za renderiranje videa. Razumijem da neće biti u mogućnosti pokrenuti na iMac's i zbog toga bi Oculus trebao biti označen za Pro korisnike zbog zahtjeva i doći po cijeni.<br/><br/>Ljudi sada kažu da tvoj kompjuter radi sve teške poslove, pa zašto je cena preko 800 dolara za nešto što ne radi ništa?<br/><br/>Uzbuđen sam zbog pravca VR, ali ne tamo gde je trenutno.<br/><br/>- Vaš prikaz (koja je procjep) nikada ne radi bilo koji od teškog dizanja. To je 800 dolara zbog onoga što zaslon radi; 110° kut gledanja (još uvijek nije ljudsko oko nego mnogo bliže od ostalih prikaza) s super niskom latencijom da se smanji ili eliminira bolest kretanja na 1200x1800 po zaslonu oka za HD kvalitetu.<br/><br/>Da, Macovi su vrlo široko korišteni za renderiranje videa, ali to renderiranje se ne događa na 30+fps. - Konačni proizvodi, ili prethodno renderirani materijal, je ono što tada postaje 30+fps.<br/><br/>- Hvala @ TheRealFixxer<br/>- Mnogo toga što kažeš ima smisla, a neke nisam znao.<br/><br/>Mislim da ne vidim VR kao igru, ali kao uranjanje i gledanje Maca su dobri u 3Dcad-u i sastavljanju videa mislim da bi mogli dobro sastaviti scenu. Stvaranje 3D svijeta i postavljanje kamera u područjima kako bi shvatili kako bi scena izgledala<br/><br/>Ali slažem se da Mac više koristi CPU cikluse čak i ako koristi GPU da pomogne.<br/><br/>Moj veliki stisak je činjenica da se Octulas gleda kao na potrošački proizvod, ako su zahtjevi toliko visoki, onda je to više pro proizvod i treba biti reklamiran kao takav. Znam da je tehnologija tu, ali ne mislim da je tu da je nazovemo potrošačkim proizvodom.<br/><br/>Apple također ima problema sa softverom. Većina ne koristi programski jezik za jabuku koji ubrzava obradu za igre jer je Apple jedino rješenje gdje mnogi koriste motore za igru koji rade na Microsoft Direct X ili Open source Opengl koji većina igara koristi za pokretanje na Linuxu i OSX-u. - Opengl je oko 20% sporiji i ponekad mnogo više od toga u odnosu na direktni x tako da vrh linijske kartice za igranje radi u OSX-u jednako brzo je karta za igranje srednje razine u prozorima. Dakle, veliki problemi da ne spominjemo da je većina Maca izgradila karte koje nemaju nadgradljivost.<br/><br/>Mekprofesionalac je toliko različit da bi Epl morao da uradi ovo jer ne bi vredelo da prodavac kartica radi ovo jer nema profita za njih sa malom količinom mogućih kupaca koji bi bili za ovo. Apple ne voli gubiti novac tako da ne vidim da će se ovo ikada dogoditi.<br/><br/>Pa, on ima pravo, iako me nije briga za Oculus rascjep, radije pričekajte StarVR. - Tužno je i to što više ne postoji nVidia kartica, svidjela mi se CUDA podrška sada ću morati kupiti PC i instalirati Linux za moje CUDA projekte.<br/><br/>Igranje je rastuće tržište i uskoro će čak i iPhone imati više GPU performansi nego Macovi. Slažem se da Apple treba ponuditi vrhunski GPU u Macu.<br/><br/>Jako me smeta nedostatak diskretne grafike visokih performansi na Mac računalima. čak i vrh kao iMac koristi zastarjeli mobilni GPU koji se, naravno, ne može nadograditi. Ako želim razviti softver za VR, Apple mi nije ostavio izbora nego kupiti ili izgraditi računalo da ga pokrenem.<br/><br/>VR nije prolazna moda, ako ste pokušali, znate na što mislim, VR će zauvijek promijeniti igru i stvaranje sadržaja. Pogledajte koliko je ljudi postalo ovisno o MMO-ima koji su svirali na ravnom ekranu, s VR-om se osjećate kao da ste u igri.<br/><br/>Ja sam prilično siguran da će Apple imati vlastitu implementaciju za Mac i iOS kada tehnologija bude spremna za potrošače, sada je više za hardcore korisnike. Kao i uvijek jabuka voli mjeriti svoje prisustvo u pravo vrijeme, s pravim proizvodom.<br/><br/>Smiješno je što mnogi ljudi znaju koji je vr bolji na osnovu OS podrške, pretpostavljam da ste obavili teška testiranja i sada su ljudi u velikoj elektronskoj radnji koji znaju najbolje.<br/><br/>- HTC je rekao da će donijeti podršku Osx-u, ali to još uvijek treba vidjeti.<br/><br/>Znam da je mnogo vas označeno na d**ks, ali shvatite da je Apple više fokusiran na laptope, a laptopi se ne mogu puniti više energije od računala, zbog veličine, topline, potrošnje struje itd.<br/><br/>Volim svog Maca, ali lordu treba poticaj u grafici. Šteta što je ovaj tip morao dati izjavu kao da je jednostavno neobrazovan. |
| The Masjid in the American Landscape: Civic Rights<br/><br/>Twelfth graders examine and explain legal rights designed to protect religious liberty. They evaluate the extent to which the First Amendment protects religious practices. They research and describe current and past legal battles over religious zoning and buildings. They discuss whether restrictions should be placed on where religious buildings are built.<br/><br/>What Members Say<br/><br/>As an online high school teacher, LP has helped me tremendously with extra resources! I have been able to use additional supplemental materials from here and students are able to gain more knowledge and a different perspective. | - Masjid u američkom krajoliku: Civic Rights<br/><br/>Oni procjenjuju u kojoj mjeri Prvi amandman štiti vjerske prakse. Oni istražuju i opisuju trenutne i prošle pravne bitke oko religijskog zoniranja i zgrada, raspravljaju o tome da li treba postaviti ograničenja na mjesto gdje se grade vjerske zgrade.<br/><br/>Šta kažu članovi?<br/><br/>Kao nastavnik online srednje škole LP mi je mnogo pomogao sa dodatnim resursima! |
| What Guys Said 19<br/><br/>No, it is because entertainment producers and product marketers want actors/actresses and models who look like the majority of the audience, so that they are relatable and therefore more effective sales tools. I am sure that Asian women look wonderful to Asian men. To me, as a white man, they have zero appeal.<br/><br/>@cowboy101 I am 100 per cent straight. I do not go outside of my race. When I was a soldier I had the "me love you long time" experience in Asia. That has left me feeling uncomfortable whenever there are Asian females near me. Sometimes I become profoundly uncomfortable, even though the particular individuals have done nothing to merit it. During a visit to Thailand, I found that the only way to prevent myself being propositioned on the street was to take white a female with me as a minder.<br/><br/>Aha the thing is that there isn't many white people (or any at all) in China, but in 'white' places, (or at least Australia) there are quite a lot of Asians around there, which made me think about this question...<br/><br/>Maybe in parts of the country where you stick at (remember, birds of a feather...), just like to republicans it seems that most people are republican etc. While it can only be small minority that you are surrounded by.<br/><br/>And as far as I know, there are a lot of whites in china, mainly by business, etc. But it's simple, most of people there are Asian, so they prefere Asian girls (dogs like dogs , cats like cats, most people prefere their own kind). And there is nothing wrong with that. Same is in white countries.<br/><br/>I think Asians are the most beautful. Unfortunately for me the 2 I got involved with in my life one was using me for my place/internet a long time ago and the recent one was a gold digging stupid bitch. She never graduated college and was 30. I would be extremely happy if I met a smart cute Asian woman near my age that was not a gold digger.<br/><br/>@Prettyapathetic yes because when a man loves deeply he always good with you on bed no matter size of tits or colour of skin and a real man always respect a girl in every relation like mother, sister, wife, girlfriend etc<br/><br/>as a model from childhood I got my start with a company called sugar & spice. I was recruited in Japan while my family was stationed there.<br/><br/>you get a job because they are going for a certain look, who are they targeting, and the area you live in.<br/><br/>I had to leave the industry last year because of health reasons. I worked with with many types of people, korean, Japanese, chinese, polish, german, American, Spanish, arabic. I've worked with children, adults, teenagers all of these ethnicities.<br/><br/>I am half white half Native American (Lakota) so they loved my look from a young age. but there are many beauty standards in the industry and not all of them are as portrayed, some being made to look worse, and some not taken seriously enough...<br/><br/>Nope, it's because the Asian men are jealous and angry and invent thousands of excuses every rare time who have Asian women in the media because they are jealous of Asian women, and Americans want to keep the status of white women, this is why the couples between Asian women and white men are boycotted and all other race with white women are pushed, it's white women wiht white men and white women with other races in American media, since it's opression and offensive for the ego of men of other race the women of own race with white but white women with other race is "anti-racism". You need to understand the American political social engineering all over these years of media, democrats, politics and propaganda.<br/><br/>Anyway, in countries like china, japan, korea they have Asian men and Asian women only and the only exceptions are when they import a white women to make some fantasy scene for them but it's not so much, it's forbiden expose the hatred and jealousy of some Asian men.<br/><br/>The Asian boys will be happy if you say something against other men, but they will be angry if you say that the Asian girl will die for the blond girl date the handsome caucasian/white dude, they will try to force Asian women to make anything against these men to these small vocal group of Asian men feel better in their hatred, excuses, racism and jealousy. This is why Asian women is not showed so much, it's because the Asian men will be angry, it's because the white women can't be replaced, and the American propaganda is around white women with white men, white women with other race, white women against white men for the other race of men, white women in everything.<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>1&#124;0<br/><br/>0&#124;0<br/><br/>Opinion Owner<br/><br/>1mo<br/><br/>All the excuses of media and propaganda and all lies for racism, jealousy and hate aren't used against white women by the same men who invent the excuses, white women all the time in the media, understand, the American social engineering is made by democrats, democrats hate white men, and the most popular couples would be white men and Asian women but it's horrible for a few group of white racists who are racists even against Asians, is bad for the angry Asian men and their excuses, is bad for the white women, the democrats really don't like white men and work hard to try to make the couple and anything wiht white men and non-white women be related to bad things while pushing white women and non-white men. It's a American political problem.<br/><br/>I think it's a opression against the ego of the men of other race, so the white guys need to look bad, be some sort of jokes, be soft, while the scenes with white women and other race is the opposite of the scenes of white men and non-white women | \"Ono što su momci rekli 19\"<br/><br/>Ne, to je zato što proizvođači zabave i trgovci proizvodima žele glumce/glumice i modele koji izgledaju kao većina publike, tako da su povezani i stoga učinkovitiji prodajni alati. Sigurna sam da Azijatkinje izgledaju divno prema Azijatima.<br/><br/>Kad sam bio vojnik, dugo sam te volio, iskustvo u Aziji mi je bilo neugodno kad god je bilo Azijatkinja u mojoj blizini. Ponekad mi postane jako neugodno, iako pojedinci nisu učinili ništa da to zasluže. Tokom posete Tajlandu, otkrio sam da je jedini način da sprečim sebe da budem predložen na ulici bio da povedem belkinju sa sobom kao umnicu.<br/><br/>- Stvar je u tome da u Kini nema mnogo bijelaca (ili bilo kojih) ali na 'bijelim' mjestima, (ili barem Australiji) ima dosta Azijata okolo, što me navelo da razmislim o ovom pitanju...<br/><br/>Možda u dijelovima zemlje u kojima se držite (sjećate se, ptice pera...), baš kao i republikanci čini se da je većina ljudi republikanac itd. dok to može biti samo mala manjina da ste okruženi.<br/><br/>Koliko ja znam, u Kini ima mnogo belaca, uglavnom poslovnih itd. ali je jednostavno, većina ljudi ima Azijatkinje, pa preferiraju Azijatkinje (pas poput pasa, mačke poput mačaka, većina ljudi više voli svoju vrstu). Isto je i u bijelim zemljama.<br/><br/>Mislim da su Azijci najljepši, na moju žalost, dvoje s kojima sam se upleo u moj život su me davno koristili za moj stan/internet, a nedavna je bila glupa kučka koja kopa zlato, nikad nije diplomirala i imala 30 godina. Bio bih izuzetno sretan kad bih upoznao pametnu, slatku Azijatkinju mojih godina koja nije kopač zlata.<br/><br/>@Prettyapatetic da jer kad muškarac voli duboko uvijek je dobar s tobom na krevetu bez obzira na veličinu sisa ili boju kože i pravi muškarac uvijek poštuje djevojku u svakom odnosu kao što su majka, sestra, žena, djevojka itd.<br/><br/>Bio sam regrutovan u Japanu dok je moja porodica bila tamo stacionirana.<br/><br/>- dobiješ posao jer traže određeni izgled, koga ciljaju, i područje u kojem živiš.<br/><br/>Radila sam s mnogim vrstama ljudi, korejskim, japanskim, kineskim, poljskim, njemačkim, američkim, španjolskim, arapskim, radio sam s djecom, odraslima, tinejdžerima, svim tim narodnostima.<br/><br/>- Ja sam polubijela polurođena Amerikanka (Lakota) tako da su voljeli moj izgled iz mladosti. ali postoje mnogi standardi ljepote u industriji i nisu svi kao prikazani, neki su napravljeni da izgledaju gore, a neki ne shvaćaju dovoljno ozbiljno...<br/><br/>Ne, to je zato što su azijski muškarci ljubomorni i ljuti i izmišljaju hiljade izgovora svaki retki put koji imaju Azijatkinje u medijima jer su ljubomorne na Azijke, a Amerikanci žele da zadrže status bjelkinja, zato se bojkotuju parovi između Azijatkinja i bijelaca, a sve druge rase sa bjelkinjama su gurnute, to su bjelkinje s bijelim muškarcima i bjelkinjama s drugim rasama u američkim medijima, budući da je to opresivno i uvredljivo za ego muškaraca drugih rasa, žene vlastite rase s bijelim, ali bjelkinjama s drugim rasama je antirakizam. Morate razumjeti američko političko socijalno inženjerstvo kroz sve ove godine medija, demokrata, politike i propagande.<br/><br/>U svakom slučaju, u zemljama kao što su Kina, Japan, Koreja imaju samo Azijatkinje i Azijatkinje i jedini izuzetak je kada uvoze bjelkinje da naprave neku scenu iz mašte za njih ali to nije toliko, to je zabranjeno razotkrivanje mržnje i ljubomore nekih Azijata.<br/><br/>- Azijski dječaci će biti sretni ako kažeš nešto protiv drugih muškaraca, ali oni će biti ljuti ako kažeš da će Azijatkinja umrijeti za plavušu koja izlazi s zgodnim kavkaskim/bijelim tipom, pokušat će prisiliti Azijatkinje da naprave bilo što protiv tih muškaraca ovim malim vokalnim grupama Azijata da se osjećaju bolje u svojoj mržnji, izgovorima, rasizmu i ljubomori. To je razlog zašto Azijatkinje nisu toliko pokazane, to je zato što će Azijati biti ljuti, to je zato što bjelkinje ne mogu biti zamijenjene, a američka propaganda je oko bjelkinja s bijelkinjama, bjelkinjama s drugom rasom, bjelkinjama protiv bijelaca za drugu rasu muškaraca, bjelkinjama u svemu.<br/><br/>\" 1\"<br/><br/>- Da. - Da, da.<br/><br/>- Ne, ne, ne.<br/><br/>Vlasnica mišljenja<br/><br/>- 1-mo.<br/><br/>Sve izgovore medija i propagande i sve laži za rasizam, ljubomoru i mržnju ne koriste protiv bjelkinja isti muškarci koji izmišljaju izgovore, bjelkinje cijelo vrijeme u medijima, razumiju, američki socijalni inženjering je napravljen od demokrata, demokrata mrzi bijelce, a najpopularniji parovi bi bili bijelci i Azijatkinje ali to je strašno za nekoliko bijelih rasista koji su rasisti čak i protiv Azijata, loše je za ljute Azijce i njihove izgovore, loše je za bjelkinje i azijatkinje, demokrate stvarno ne vole bijele muškarce i trude se nastojati da par i bilo što što stranče bijelci i nebijele žene budu povezani s lošim stvarima dok guraju bijele žene i nebijele muškarce. -To je američki politički problem.<br/><br/>Mislim da je to suprostavljanje egu muškaraca druge rase, tako da bijelci trebaju izgledati loše, biti neka vrsta šala, biti mekani, dok su scene s bijelim ženama i drugom rasom suprotne scenama bijelih muškaraca i ne-bijelih žena |
