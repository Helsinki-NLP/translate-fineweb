| There is a well known quote by Plato who once said: "I would teach children music, physics and philosophy, but most importantly music for the patterns in music and all the arts are the keys to learning.<br/><br/>Whatever your religion or culture music will always play and important part. It often defines what is essentially unique about a particular group of people and helps to create a sense of community. Dr Shinichi Suzuki describes his teaching this way: 'Teaching music is not my main purpose. I want to make good citizens. If a child hears fine music from the day of his birth and learns to play it himself, he develops sensitivity, discipline and endurance. He gets a beautiful heart. Along with improving self-esteem and self-expression their are also benefits that include increasing memory and is believed that learning music can boost academic achievement. Although the exact mechanics of this is often not understood, the belief is that learning music stimulates parts of the brain that then have a carry-over impact on all academic areas.<br/><br/>Research indicates that the brain of a musician, even a young one works differently than that of a non-musician. In the field of Neuroscience research has shown that a larger proportion of neural pathways are used in learning music as the brain has to work harder.<br/><br/>There is a link between this and improved spacial-temporal skills that help in solving multistep problems such as in the fields of maths, engineering and the arts.<br/><br/>It also provides structure and focus which may benefit other areas of learning. As well as bringing, structure, organisation and discipline which carries over into other areas of your childs life we must not forget the most important fact about learning music. It brings enjoyment and a sense of fun. | Platon je jednom rekao: \"Učio bih decu muzici, fizici i filozofiji, ali najvažnija muzika za obrasce u muzici i svim umetnostima su ključevi učenja.<br/><br/>Ono često definira ono što je u biti jedinstveno kod određene grupe ljudi i pomaže u stvaranju osjećaja zajedništva. Dr Šiniči Suzuki ovako opisuje svoje učenje: \"Učenje muzike nije moja glavna svrha, želim da budem dobar građanin, ako dete čuje dobru muziku od dana njegovog rođenja i nauči da je svira sam, razvija osetljivost, disciplinu i izdržljivost. Zajedno sa poboljšanjem samopoštovanja i samoizražavanjem njihovo su i koristi koje uključuju povećanje pamćenja i vjeruje se da učenje glazbe može potaknuti akademsko postignuće. - Iako se točna mehanika toga često ne razumije, vjerovanje je da učenje glazbe stimulira dijelove mozga koji tada imaju prijenosni utjecaj na sva akademska područja.<br/><br/>Istraživanje pokazuje da mozak muzičara, čak i mladi radi drugačije od mozga neglazbenika. U području istraživanja neuroznanosti pokazalo se da se veći udio neuronskih puteva koristi u učenju glazbe jer mozak mora raditi jače.<br/><br/>- Postoji veza između toga i poboljšanih spacijsko-temporalnih vještina koje pomažu u rješavanju višestepenih problema kao što su u oblasti matematike, inženjerstva i umjetnosti.<br/><br/>On također pruža strukturu i fokus koji mogu imati koristi od drugih područja učenja. Kao i dovođenje, ustrojstvo, organizacija i disciplina koja se prenosi u druga područja vašeg dječjeg života ne smijemo zaboraviti najvažniju činjenicu o učenju glazbe. |

| Breaking out of the Box Fay Tsitou investigates moving objects in British museums<br/><br/>Objects are the main 'protagonists' in two different fields: museums and puppetry. In both cases, the objects enable us to interact with our surroundings, our past, and our inner self.<br/><br/>Museum visitors perceive a vast majority of the museum objects from a distance, while these remain mainly static and mute in or outside the galleries' showcases. On the other hand, puppet theatre audiences join the world of moving objects/puppets that are often literally given a voice (sound or speech). Nevertheless, is there a common ground of static and moving objects worth exploring in these contexts?<br/><br/>Museum Puppetry Research<br/><br/>Museum puppetry adopts the language of puppetry within museum exhibitions. It aims at investigating the interaction among museum visitors, objects' stories, exhibits' histories and exhibitions' narratives. It examines how object-centred activities discretely disguise their visitor-centred identity while they enable visitors to free their mind and heart from possible inhibitions or preconceptions. Museum puppetry is a type of museum learning activity, similar to and often combined with museum theatre. However, as G.B. Shaw might say, 'the actor in his primitive form' (i.e. the puppet) unblocks the audiences' imagination which '…plays a far greater part than the exertions of the actors'.<br/><br/>Museum puppetry examples in UK<br/><br/>There are a number of variables that characterise a museum puppetry activity, such as the type of museum, the type of puppetry, the target group, the activity area in the museum, the degree of interaction among the four units (participants, exhibits/collections, puppets, practitioners), the use of verbal and/or object language. For instance, one type of activity could be a complete show around a museum's performing object, as for example in the Keswick museum in Cumbria where Ali Mc Caw presented a wayang kulit style performance, The Musical Stonemason. The show combined shadow and table-top puppetry with a gamelan orchestra which incorporated a museum object, the musical stone of Skiddaw. Moreover, shows can be related to an exhibit's narrative. For example Professor Geoff Felix's popular Punch and Judy street puppet theatre show was presented in the garden of the Geoffrey Museum and at the Museum of London as part of the Victoria Street exhibit (It is no surprise to learn that Felix's beautifully crafted booth was once mistaken for an exhibit as it was standing in an open area at the same museum!)<br/><br/>Other examples include:<br/><br/>A workshop on puppet construction and manipulation - like the skilfully structured workshop that follows Anna Ingleby's shadow puppetry shows<br/><br/>A puppet workshop based on the museum's handling collection - as this happens at the Horniman Museum (London) to acquaint primary school students with the various types of puppets<br/><br/>A puppet exhibit - like the automata or the dinosaur animatronics in the Natural History Museum in London<br/><br/>Creative learning processes with the use of everyday objects - as these are facilitated by Hedsor Creative Learning, to enhance museum interpretation in places such as Sheffield Museums and Galleries Trust and Manchester City Art Gallery<br/><br/>A museum tour with the puppet as a storyteller/facilitator - like Vivien Mousdell's palaeontologist Dr. Ambrose in her puppet show Fossils Alive<br/><br/>An outreach programme - like Jill Webster's interactive puppet show Pirates! All Hands on Deck!, commissioned by Glasgow Science Centre<br/><br/>Manipulation of puppets that belong to original collections is considered par excellence a museum puppetry case - as John Mc Cormick performed with the Victorian Marionettes at the Museum Theatre in London.<br/><br/>The following cases further illuminate the multifaceted potential of performing objects in museums.<br/><br/>'Authentic' metaphors<br/><br/>For twenty-five years adult museum visitors have been enjoying Robert Poulter's New Model Theatre shows in conjunction with special exhibitions and collections, in numerous European and US museums. During Poulter's sophisticated toy theatre shows, paper figures travel smoothly in time and space while interacting with each other and their stage environment. Backdrops are changing continuously. The audience perceives the world represented on stage neither as something static, nor fragmented, but fluidly constructed moment by moment. Although puppetry favours mythological and fictional stories, Poulter makes use of his talent in painting and research skills to interpret selectively historical evidence via flat figures and settings that move vertically and horizontally. The elaborate, live montage evolves as fast and as easy, as the turning of a page. For example, during the art history show Mr Turner Gets Steamed Up, action moves instantly from Margate to London, or from the view out of Turner's window onto the canvas of his famous paintings. The liberties taken with the spoken and visual narrative are noted in detail on the program of the show, allowing Poulter's beautifully crafted paper figures to stand bravely as ultimate 'authentic' metaphors on a miniature stage of History.<br/><br/>Multi-sensory experience<br/><br/>Real coffee beans, shells and cloves cover small wooden boats which sail in a Museum of Docklands' performance originally devised for visitors with the most complex educational needs. The boats' cargo can be smelled and felt as they (metaphorically) travel over the sea to London's Victorian docks in a storytelling piece entitled Over the Sea to London, devised by Emily Capstick and Alison Hale (Peoplescape Theatre). Peoplescape have been creating participatory performances in community, education and museum settings for twelve years. Taking advantage of applied theatre techniques, live music and puppetry's rich potential and flexibility, Capstick and Hale replace verbal description of the past with live action in the present. They create a multi-sensory engaging experience for an audience in-role role with the use of puppets and manipulated objects, without relying on verbal communication.<br/><br/>Popular art<br/><br/>Last year, Dr Matthew Isaac Cohen, as a dhalang shadow puppeteer performed his Ramayana in four parts with the Southbank Gamelan Players at the British Library, where an exhibition under the same title explored how the Indian epic story is retold over the centuries. Similarly to a presentation to an Indonesian audience (who enjoy a great deal of freedom in watching the popular story – spectators can move around, take a nap, leave the show and return!), the Library's audience could watch the nearly three-hour performance seated on pillows or circulating around it. During the show, the spectators could also either move towards the exhibition area to enjoy a museum experience while still hearing the superb chanting and music, or they could go behind the screen and the performers to have a drink while still enjoying the delightful puppet show from the back, viewed through a door opening. While standing in the middle, the wayang kulit Indonesian type of shadow puppetry created an intimate in-between space bridging two worlds: art and life.<br/><br/>Two remarkable cases outside UK<br/><br/>In 2002, a Brooklyn-based constructor/puppeteer, Chris Green, was commissioned to create a part of Noah's Ark exhibit in the Skirball Cultural Center in LA. His sophisticated kinetic or fully manipulated installations – interactive exhibits and puppets manipulated by the museum staff – were made of recycled materials and today attract people of all ages and backgrounds. The Noah's Ark exhibit received awards of excellence from the American Association of Museums and Themed Entertainment Association.<br/><br/>In 2001, the renowned French director Philippe Philippe Genty presented Le Concert Incroyable in the Grande Salle de l' Evolution in the Natural History Museum of Paris. High technology projections of inventive graphic designs were used and interacted with the central exhibit of the gallery: a march that consisted of large mummified animals. This puppet and physical theatre show was a composition of mesmerising images, dramatic action and chorus singing; a unique experience for an adult audience.<br/><br/>So, as we can see museum puppetry embraces a far broader spectrum of practice than might at first be thought! To perceive museums as just another sort of venue, and museum puppetry as a merely a medium suitable to attract preschoolers with their families during Christmas period, is limiting. Recognising the performing objects' potential and communicative power, some museums support their use for their activities and learning programmes year-round.<br/><br/>In fact, these are the museums that foster a close relation between the two inanimate 'soul brothers': museum exhibits and performing objects. In the hands of the experts, such interactions give an extra meaning to an old mystery: '…Inanimate objects / have you then a soul / That clings to our soul / and forces it to love?...' (Alphonse Lamartine, Milly ou la terre natale, 1822)<br/><br/>George Bernard Shaw quotation is taken from his introduction to Max Von Boehn's Puppets and Automata (Dover Publications. New York, 1972, trans. Josephine Nicoll) | - Izlazak iz Kutije Fay Tsitou istražuje pokretne objekte u britanskim muzejima<br/><br/>Predmeti su glavni 'protagonisti' u dva različita polja: muzejima i lutkarstvu.U oba slučaja, objekti nam omogućavaju interakciju sa okolinom, prošlošću i unutrašnjom sobom.<br/><br/>- Posjetitelji muzeja opažaju veliku većinu muzejskih objekata iz daljine, dok oni ostaju uglavnom statični i nijemi u ili izvan izložaba galerija. S druge strane, publika lutkarskog kazališta pridružuje se svijetu pokretnih objekata/puppeta kojima se često doslovno daje glas (zvuk ili govor). Ipak, postoji li zajednički temelj statičkih i pokretnih objekata vrijednih istraživanja u tim kontekstima?<br/><br/>Muzejska istraživanja lutaka<br/><br/>Muzejsko lutkarstvo usvaja jezik lutkarstva unutar muzejskih izložbi. Cilj mu je istražiti interakciju među posjetiteljima muzeja, priče o predmetima, izložbene povijesti i izložbene pripovijetke. Ispituje kako aktivnosti usmjerene na objekte diskretno prikrivaju identitet posjetitelja dok posjetiteljima omogućavaju oslobađanje uma i srca od mogućih inhibicija ili predumišljaja. Muzejska lutkarstvo je vrsta muzejske aktivnosti učenja, slična i često u kombinaciji s muzejskim kazalištem. - Međutim, kako bi G.B. Shaw mogao reći, 'glumac u svojoj primitivnoj formi' (tj. marioneta) deblokira maštu publike koja '...igra daleko veću ulogu od napora glumaca'.<br/><br/>Muzejski primjeri lutkarstva u Velikoj Britaniji<br/><br/>Postoji niz varijabli koje karakterišu muzejsku lutkarsku aktivnost, kao što su vrsta muzeja, vrsta lutkarstva, ciljna grupa, područje aktivnosti u muzeju, stupanj interakcije među četiri jedinice (sudionici, izložbe/kolekcije, lutke, praktičari), korištenje verbalnog i/ili objektnog jezika. Na primjer, jedna vrsta aktivnosti mogla bi biti kompletna predstava oko izvedbenog objekta muzeja, kao na primjer u muzeju Keswick u Cumbrii gdje je Ali Mc Caw predstavio wayang kulit stilsku izvedbu, The Musical Stonemason. Serija je kombinovala sjenu i lutkarstvo na stolu sa gamelanskim orkestrom koji je inkorporirao muzejski objekt, muzički kamen Skiddaw. Na primjer, popularna predstava Punch i Judy ulične lutkarske predstave profesora Geoffa Felixa predstavljena je u vrtu Muzeja Geoffea i u Muzeju Londona u sklopu izložbe Victoria Street (Ne čudi da je Felixov lijepo izrađeni štand jednom zamijenjen za izložbu koja je stajala na otvorenom prostoru u istom muzeju!)<br/><br/>Drugi primjeri uključuju:<br/><br/>- Radionica o izradi lutaka i manipulaciji - poput vješto strukturirane radionice koja prati lutkarske predstave Anne Ingleby iz sjene<br/><br/>- Lutkarska radionica zasnovana na muzejskoj kolekciji rukovanja - kako se to događa u Horniman muzeju (London) upoznati učenike osnovnih škola s raznim vrstama lutaka<br/><br/>Izložba lutaka - poput automata ili animatronike dinosaura u Prirodoslovnom muzeju u Londonu<br/><br/>- Kreativni procesi učenja uz upotrebu svakodnevnih predmeta - jer ih olakšava Hedsor Kreativno učenje, kako bi se poboljšala interpretacija muzeja na mjestima kao što su Sheffield Museums and Galleries Trust i Manchester City Art Gallery<br/><br/>Muzejska turneja sa marionetom kao pripovjedač/posrednik - kao palaeontolog Vivien Mousdell Dr. Ambrose u svojoj lutkarskoj predstavi Fosili Alive<br/><br/>Svi na palubu!, naručio Glasgow Science Centre<br/><br/>Manipulacija lutkama koje pripadaju originalnim zbirkama smatra se par izvrsnosti muzejskim lutkarskim slučajem - kao što je John Mc Cormick izvodio s viktorijanskim marionetama u Muzejskom kazalištu u Londonu.<br/><br/>- Sljedeći slučajevi dodatno osvjetljavaju višeznačni potencijal izvođenja predmeta u muzejima.<br/><br/>\"Autentične\" metafore<br/><br/>Dvadeset pet godina posjetioci muzeja za odrasle uživaju u emisijama novog kazališta Roberta Poultera u suradnji s posebnim izložbama i zbirkama, u brojnim europskim i američkim muzejima. Za vrijeme Poulterovih sofisticiranih kazališnih predstava o igračkama, papirne figure glatko putuju kroz vrijeme i prostor dok međusobno interaguju i njihov scenski okoliš. - Publika percipira svijet predstavljen na pozornici niti kao nešto statično, niti fragmentirano, nego fluidno konstruirano iz trenutka u trenutak. Iako lutkarstvo favorizira mitološke i izmišljene priče, Poulter koristi svoj talent u slikarstvu i istraživačkim vještinama za tumačenje selektivno povijesnih dokaza preko ravnih figura i postavki koje se kreću okomito i vodoravno. - Razrađena, živa montaža evoluira jednako brzo i lako, kao okretanje stranice. Na primjer, tijekom izložbe povijesti umjetnosti g. Turner dobiva paru, akcija se kreće odmah od Margatea do Londona, ili s pogleda kroz Turnerov prozor na platno njegovih slavnih slika. - Slobode poduzete sa izgovorenom i vizualnom narativom detaljno su zabilježene na programu emisije, omogućujući Poulterovim lijepo izrađenim papirnatim figurama da hrabro stoje kao konačne 'autentične' metafore na minijaturnoj pozornici povijesti.<br/><br/>) Multi-senzorno iskustvo<br/><br/>- Pravi zrna kave, školjke i klinčići pokrivaju male drvene čamce koji plove u izvedbi Muzeja Docklandsa originalno osmišljenom za posjetitelje s najkompleksnijim obrazovnim potrebama. - Teret brodova može se namirisati i osjetiti dok (metaforički) putuju preko mora do londonskih viktorijanskih dokova u pripovjedačkom komadu pod nazivom Preko mora do Londona, kojeg su osmislili Emily Capstick i Alison Hale (Peoplescape Theatre). Peoplescape već dvanaest godina stvara participativne nastupe u zajednici, obrazovanju i muzejskim postavkama. - Koristeći primijenjene kazališne tehnike, živu glazbu i lutkarstvo bogat potencijal i fleksibilnost, Capstick i Hale zamjenjuju verbalni opis prošlosti sa živom akcijom u sadašnjosti. Oni stvaraju višeosječajno iskustvo za audijenciju u role ulozi uz korištenje lutaka i manipuliranih predmeta, bez oslanjanja na verbalnu komunikaciju.<br/><br/>\"Popularna umjetnost\"<br/><br/>Prošle godine, dr. Matthew Isaac Cohen, kao lutkar iz sjene Dalanga, izveo je Ramayanu u četiri dijela s igračima Southbank Gamelana u Britanskoj knjižnici, gdje je izložba pod istim naslovom istraživala kako se indijska epska priča prepričava kroz stoljeća. - Slično prezentaciji indonežanskoj publici (koja uživa veliku slobodu u gledanju popularne priče - gledatelji se mogu kretati uokolo, drijemati, napustiti predstavu i vratiti se!), publika knjižnice mogla je gledati gotovo trosatnu izvedbu sjedeći na jastucima ili kružeći oko nje. \"Za vrijeme predstave, gledatelji su također mogli krenuti prema izložbenom prostoru kako bi uživali u muzejskom iskustvu dok su još uvijek slušali vrhunsko pjevanje i glazbu, ili bi mogli ići iza ekrana i izvođači popiti piće dok još uživaju u divnoj lutkarskoj predstavi s leđa, gledanoj kroz otvaranje vrata. - Dok stoji u sredini, wayang kulit Indonezijski tip sjene lutkarstvo stvorio intiman između svemira premošćivanje dva svijeta: umjetnost i život.<br/><br/>Dva izuzetna slučaja izvan Velike Britanije<br/><br/>2002. godine, konstruktor/pupeter sa sjedištem u Brooklynu, Chris Green, dobio je zadatak da napravi dio izložbe Noine arke u kulturnom centru Skirball u LA-u. Njegove sofisticirane kinetičke ili potpuno manipulirane instalacije, interaktivni eksponati i lutke kojima je manipuliralo osoblje muzeja, izrađene su od recikliranih materijala i danas privlače ljude svih uzrasta i pozadina. Izložba Noina kovčega dobila je nagrade izvrsnosti od Američkog udruženja muzeja i Udruženja tematske zabave.<br/><br/>2001, poznati francuski redatelj Philippe Philippe Genty predstavio je Le Concert Incroyable u Grande Salle de l' Evolution u Prirodoslovnom muzeju Pariza. ) Korištene su visokotehnološke projekcije inventivnih grafičkih dizajna i interagovane sa središnjom izložbom galerije: marš koji se sastojao od velikih mumificiranih životinja. Ova lutkarska i fizička predstava bila je kompozicija hipnotizirajućih slika, dramske akcije i horskog pjevanja; jedinstveno iskustvo za odraslu publiku.<br/><br/>Dakle, kao što možemo vidjeti muzejsko lutkarstvo obuhvaća daleko širi spektar prakse nego što bi se u početku moglo pomisliti! \"Osjećati muzeje kao samo još jednu vrstu prostora, a muzejsko lutkarstvo kao samo medij koji je pogodan za privlačenje predškolaca sa svojim obiteljima u božićnom periodu, ograničava. \"Priznajući potencijal izvođenja predmeta i komunikativnu moć, neki muzeji podržavaju njihovu upotrebu za svoje aktivnosti i programe učenja tokom cijele godine.<br/><br/>U stvari, to su muzeji koji podstiču blizak odnos između dva neživa 'braće duše': muzejskih eksponata i izvođenja predmeta. - Neživi predmeti / imate li tada dušu / koja se drži naše duše / i prisiljava je da voli?... (Alphonse Lamartine, Milly ou la terre natale, 1822)<br/><br/>Citat Georgea Bernarda Shawa preuzet je iz njegovog uvoda u Max Von Boehnove lutke i automate (Dover Publications. New York, 1972, trans.

Almost 20 years later, the challenge of ensuring women's rights remains.<br/><br/>On May 30, the UN Secretary-General's High-Level Panel on the Post-2015 Development Agenda released its report, which contains a standalone goal on gender equality and empowerment of women and girls. In addition, the illustrative health goal contains a target on ensuring universal sexual and reproductive health and rights.<br/><br/>Gender equality and ensuring universal sexual and reproductive health and rights are essential ingredients for sustainable development. We must maintain the momentum gained on these issues in the high-level panel through to the final deliberations at the UN General Assembly in 2014 on global goals for poverty eradication and sustainable development. Now more than ever, we need to recognise the centrality of gender equality. Now more than ever, we must end gender inequality as the grand objective of the 21st century.<br/><br/>Promoting gender equality in the post-2015 agenda includes finishing the work that the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) started. Unfortunately, the MDGs that are most off-track are those directly linked to achieving gender equality, such as reducing maternal mortality and ensuring universal reproductive health and rights. There is by now overwhelming evidence that gender inequality severely constrains women's independence and freedom, control over their own bodies, sexuality and childbearing, and restricts their life choices and opportunities in terms of education and work. There is also abundant evidence that it significantly slows economic growth in both rich and poor countries.<br/><br/>Across the world, in all societies, women and girls consistently face a range of barriers to equality - such as wage gaps, gender-based violence, child marriage and female genital mutilation. The poor and otherwise socially disadvantaged are further marginalised through crippling combinations of gender discrimination and poverty discrimination. Therefore, tackling the gender inequalities and critical barriers that prevent women and girls from exercising their rights and empowering themselves must be at the heart of our efforts to create sustainable, prosperous and resilient societies.<br/><br/>Achieving gender equality - including women's rights, women's health and women's empowerment - is not only a means to eradicating poverty and achieving sustainable development, it is an important end in itself.<br/><br/>Landmark documents such as the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development, and the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action have long established that women's rights are human rights. CEDAW, established in 1979 and ratified by almost every country in the world, places responsibility for ensuring equal rights for men and women with the state. Women must be offered the same access to all aspects of life as men in order to reach equal status.<br/><br/>We have not achieved this yet. Therefore, we are recommending that the UN General Assembly consider effectively tackling this challenge, and the unfinished business of the MDGs, by ensuring that gender equality and sexual and reproductive health are at the centre of the post-2015 development agenda, with relevant goals, targets and indicators approved.<br/><br/>This proposal has strong support among a wide range of stakeholders and development actors, including many governments, multilateral agencies and civil society organisations. The respective national, regional and global thematic consultations on health, inequalities and education in the post-2015 agenda, as well as the Rio+20 outcome document's framework for action and follow-up, have all stressed the centrality of gender equality and women's empowerment.<br/><br/>The MDGs created an unprecedented mobilisation of political will and resources in recent years, not least around MDGs 4 and 5 related to reducing maternal and infant death. Both of these goals are inextricably linked to gender equality and the rights, health and empowerment of women and girls. It is essential for our common efforts regarding these to be carried over and further strengthened in the post-2015 agenda. Including goals on gender equality and sexual and reproductive health and rights in the post-2015 agenda will highlight, once again, the central role of women's rights as human rights. The panel report has given a strong momentum for these issues - now it is up to all of us global actors to maintain it, and make sure that it survives all the way to 2015.<br/><br/>We are at a decisive point in our common history when our policy intentions and actions will shape the future of human development and our planet in the face of both unprecedented achievements and persistent challenges. Let us ensure that the post-2015 agenda is truly universal and inclusive, and that the ultimate goal is a world where all - men, women, young people and children - are treated as equally worthy lens is suitable for general macro work but if you want greater subject-to-lens distance a 100mm lens will give you this at a price.

Osim toga, ilustrativni zdravstveni cilj sadrži cilj osiguranja univerzalnog seksualnog i reproduktivnog zdravlja i prava.<br/><br/>- Jednakost spolova i osiguranje univerzalnog seksualnog i reproduktivnog zdravlja i prava ključni su sastojci za održivi razvoj. - Moramo održati zamah postignut na tim pitanjima u panelu na visokoj razini do konačnih razmatranja u Generalnoj skupštini UN-a 2014. godine o globalnim ciljevima za iskorjenjivanje siromaštva i održivi razvoj. Sada više nego ikad, moramo priznati centralnu jednakost spolova, a sada više nego ikad, moramo okončati nejednakost spolova kao veliki cilj 21. stoljeća.<br/><br/>Promicanje ravnopravnosti spolova na dnevnom redu nakon 2015. godine uključuje dovršetak rada koji su započeli Milenijski razvojni ciljevi (MDG-ovi). Na žalost, MDG-ovi koji su najviše off-track su oni izravno povezani s postizanjem ravnopravnosti spolova, kao što je smanjenje smrtnosti majke i osiguranje univerzalnog reproduktivnog zdravlja i prava. - Do sada postoje veliki dokazi da rodna nejednakost ozbiljno ograničava žensku neovisnost i slobodu, kontrolu nad vlastitim tijelima, seksualnošću i rađanjem djece, te ograničava njihove životne izbore i mogućnosti u pogledu obrazovanja i rada. Postoji i obilje dokaza da značajno usporava ekonomski rast i u bogatim i u siromašnim zemljama.<br/><br/>- Širom svijeta, u svim društvima, žene i djevojčice dosljedno se suočavaju s nizom prepreka jednakosti - kao što su razlike u plaćama, rodno zasnovano nasilje, brak djece i sakaćenje ženskih genitalija. - Siromašni i inače socijalno nepovoljni su dodatno marginalizirani kroz osakaćene kombinacije rodne diskriminacije i diskriminacije siromaštva. Dakle, rješavanje nejednakosti spolova i kritičnih prepreka koje sprečavaju žene i djevojke da iskoriste svoja prava i osnaže sebe mora biti u središtu naših napora da stvorimo održiva, prosperitetna i otporna društva.<br/><br/>Postizanje ravnopravnosti spolova - uključujući ženska prava, žensko zdravlje i žensko osnaživanje - nije samo sredstvo za iskorjenjivanje siromaštva i postizanje održivog razvoja, to je važan kraj sam po sebi.<br/><br/>- Landmark dokumenti kao što su Konvencija o eliminaciji svih oblika diskriminacije protiv žena (CEDAW), Program djelovanja Međunarodne konferencije o stanovništvu i razvoju, i Pekingska deklaracija i Platforma za djelovanje odavno su utvrdili da su prava žena ljudska prava. - CEDAW, osnovan 1979. i ratificiran od strane gotovo svake zemlje na svijetu, stavlja odgovornost za osiguranje jednakih prava za muškarce i žene sa državom. - Ženama se mora ponuditi isti pristup svim aspektima života kao muškarcima kako bi dostigla jednak status.<br/><br/>Ovo još nismo postigli. Stoga preporučujemo da Generalna skupština UN-a razmotri učinkovito rješavanje ovog izazova, te nedovršeno poslovanje MDG-ova, osiguravajući da se ravnopravnost spolova i seksualno i reproduktivno zdravlje nalaze u središtu razvojnog programa nakon 2015. godine, s relevantnim ciljevima, ciljevima i indikatorima odobrenim.<br/><br/>Ovaj prijedlog ima snažnu podršku među širokim rasponom dionika i razvojnih aktera, uključujući mnoge vlade, multilateralne agencije i organizacije civilnog društva. - Odgovarajući nacionalni, regionalni i globalni tematski savjeti o zdravlju, nejednakostima i obrazovanju na dnevnom redu nakon 2015. godine, kao i okvir dokumenta Rio+20 ishoda za djelovanje i praćenje, naglasili su centralnu jednakost spolova i osnaživanje žena.<br/><br/>MDG-ovi su posljednjih godina stvorili nezapamćenu mobilizaciju političke volje i resursa, ne najmanje oko MDG-ova 4 i 5 vezanih uz smanjenje majčine i dojenčadi smrti. Oba su cilja neraskidivo povezana s jednakošću spolova i pravima, zdravljem i osnaživanjem žena i djevojčica. - Uključujući ciljeve o ravnopravnosti spolova i seksualnom i reproduktivnom zdravlju i pravima u programu nakon 2015. godine naglasit će, još jednom, središnju ulogu prava žena kao ljudskih prava. Izvješće panela dalo je snažan zamah za ta pitanja - sada je na svima nama globalnim akterima da ga održimo, i osiguramo da preživi sve do 2015. godine.<br/><br/>Mi smo u odlučujućoj tački u našoj zajedničkoj istoriji kada će naše političke namere i akcije oblikovati budućnost ljudskog razvoja i naše planete u suočavanju sa nezapamćenim dostignućima i trajnim izazovima. - Uvjerimo se da je agenda nakon 2015. doista univerzalna i uključiva, i da je krajnji cilj svijet u kojem se svi - muškarci, žene, mladi i djeca - tretiraju kao jednako dostojne leće pogodna je za opći makro-rad ali ako želite veću udaljenost od subjekta do leća od 100mm dat će vam ovo po cijeni.

| How Mobile Games Can Help Improve Sanitation<br/><br/>More than 2.5 billion people, many of them in Africa and South Asia, face grave sanitation challenges. In many of these countries, people are more likely to own a cell phone than a toilet. Therefore there is an obvious opportunity to use mobile technology to promote the use of sanitation and good hygiene in order to make a substantial impact. Mobile phones in Kenya transfer money; Bangladeshis listen to English language classes on their phones; and in Ghana, women entrepreneurs use mobiles to market their wares.<br/><br/>The growing Games for Change industry applies principles of traditional social games to address specific challenges . For example, in the UK, Channel 4 commissioned the game developer Playniac to build an online game to improve financial literacy among the 50% of young Britons who are heavily in debt. In Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, young developers have built iPhone, Android, and Javascript games based on local storylines. Pledge 51, a Nigerian developer group, recently released Danfo, a game where the user plays as a bus driver coping with dense Nigerian traffic.<br/><br/>Hattery Labs has begun to explore how games might improve sanitation practices. The typical game-players in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia are young urban males who own smartphones, but many of the communities that face the greatest sanitation challenges have less advanced technology. However, Javascript games built for Nokia S40 phones (among the most popular handsets in the developing world) provide an opportunity to send a compelling message on good behavior practices in sanitation and hygiene. A full report on how games can promote good sanitation and behavior practice is HERE.<br/><br/>Here are a few game ideas that might prove effective:<br/><br/>Soap Wars makes hand-washing an entertaining challenge where players use the soap dispenser as a weapon against dangerous germs. Sanitation Heroes engages players in the process of sanitation maintenance from capturing, transporting, and disposing of feces to reusing it as fertilizer. It features different scenarios in a memory game that prompts the player to match the solution to each different stage of capturing and treating waste.<br/><br/>Toilet Hunt introduces obstacles along the course of finding a safe place to go to the bathroom. As the player searches for sanitary latrines on a basic map, they must use the clues to decide whether the latrine is safe.<br/><br/>There are outstanding questions that the current research hasn't resolved:<br/><br/>How does the game appeal to illiterate players, who need rich visual descriptions and narratives to guide the gameplay? The need for rich imagery does not necessarily match the small, low-resolution screens of Nokia S40 phones.<br/><br/>How does the game appeal to women, who are critical participants in sanitation but don't represent the largest percentage of mobile game players? One initial idea is to frame sanitation storylines as mobile 'comic books', allowing users to scroll through an interesting narrative with subtle sanitation and hygiene messages.<br/><br/>How can the lessons from the game translate to rural areas, where there are fewer who can access it and more who face the challenges that it seeks to mitigate? Urban users might take their phone with them to their home village and share it with their friends and family, who will begin playing the game and continue to play out the game's storyline in real life.<br/><br/>Finally, how can the game measure its impact on sanitation behavior? User adoption and engagement in this context is a false metric to evaluate impact since users might play the game but have their behavior unchanged. Any solution to measure impact should combine a mobile game with other digital and non-digital applications that help users track their sanitation use alongside their game success. Local developers can work in partnership with games for change experts, community organizations, and telecommunications companies to test these approaches.<br/><br/>This report explores the potential of using mobile games to engage citizens in addressing persistent community challenges but we want to hear from you. Is this an effective way to engage target populations? Are there other ideas for how games can impact behavior change? Would you play these games | Kako mobilne igre mogu pomoći u poboljšanju sanacije<br/><br/>Više od 2,5 milijarde ljudi, od kojih se mnogi u Africi i Južnoj Aziji suočavaju sa teškim sanitarnim izazovima. Stoga postoji očita prilika da se mobilnom tehnologijom promiče upotreba sanitarne i dobre higijene kako bi se ostvario znatan utjecaj. - Mobilni telefoni u Keniji prenose novac; Bangladeši slušaju časove engleskog jezika na svojim telefonima; a u Gani, žene poduzetnice koriste mobilne telefone za prodaju svoje robe.<br/><br/>Sve veće igre za industriju promjena primjenjuju principe tradicionalnih društvenih igara za rješavanje specifičnih izazova . Na primjer, u Velikoj Britaniji, Channel 4 je naručio razvijatelja igara Playniac da izgradi online igru kako bi poboljšao financijsku pismenost među 50% mladih Britanaca koji su u velikim dugovima. U podsaharskoj Africi i Južnoj Aziji mladi programeri izgradili su iPhone, Android i Javascript igre bazirane na lokalnim pričama. - Zakletva 51, nigerijski developer grupa, nedavno pušten Danfo, igra u kojoj korisnik igra kao vozač autobusa koji se nosi sa gustim Nigerijskim prometom.<br/><br/>Hattery Labs je počeo istraživati kako bi igre mogle poboljšati sanitarne prakse. Tipični igrači igara u subsaharskoj Africi i Južnoj Aziji mladi su urbani muškarci koji posjeduju pametne telefone, ali mnoge zajednice koje se suočavaju s najvećim sanitarnim izazovima imaju manje naprednu tehnologiju. Međutim, Javascript igre izgrađene za Nokia S40 telefone (među najpopularnijim slušalicama u zemljama u razvoju) pružaju priliku da pošalju uvjerljivu poruku o praksi dobrog ponašanja u sanitarnoj i higijeni. Pun izvještaj o tome kako igre mogu promovirati dobre sanitarije i prakse ponašanja je OVDJE.<br/><br/>- Evo nekoliko ideja za igru koje bi se mogle pokazati učinkovitima:<br/><br/>Sapun Ratovi čine ručno pranjem ruku zabavni izazov u kojem igrači koriste aparat za sapun kao oružje protiv opasnih bacila. - Sanitarni heroji uključuju igrače u proces sanitarnog održavanja od hvatanja, transporta i odlaganja izmeta do ponovnog korištenja kao gnojiva. - Ima različite scenarije u igri memorije koja potiče igrača da odgovara rješenju svake različite faze hvatanja i tretiranja otpada.<br/><br/>Lov na toalet uvodi prepreke duž puta pronalaženja sigurnog mjesta za odlazak u kupaonicu. Dok igrač traži sanitarne zahode na osnovnoj karti, moraju koristiti tragove kako bi odlučili je li zahod siguran.<br/><br/>Postoje neizmjerna pitanja koja trenutna istraživanja nisu riješila:<br/><br/>Kako se igra apelira na nepismene igrače, kojima su potrebni bogati vizuelni opisi i pripovijetke kako bi vodili gameplay? Potreba za bogatim slikama ne mora nužno odgovarati malim ekranima niske rezolucije Nokia S40 telefona.<br/><br/>Kako se igra dopadne ženama, koje su kritične učesnice u sanitarnom radu, ali ne predstavljaju najveći postotak igrača mobilnih igara? - Jedna od početnih ideja je da se uokvire sanitalne priče kao mobilne 'komične knjige', omogućavajući korisnicima da prođu kroz zanimljivu narativu sa suptilnim higijenskim i higijenskim porukama.<br/><br/>Kako se lekcije iz igre mogu prevesti na ruralna područja, gdje ih je manje koji joj mogu pristupiti, a više onih koji se suočavaju s izazovima koje želi ublažiti? Urbani korisnici bi mogli da odnesu telefon sa sobom u svoje rodno selo i da ga podele sa svojim prijateljima i porodicom, koji će početi da igraju igru i da nastave da igraju priču igre u stvarnom životu.<br/><br/>Usvajanje i angažman korisnika u ovom kontekstu je lažna metrika za procjenu utjecaja jer korisnici mogu igrati igru, ali imaju svoje ponašanje nepromijenjeno. - Svako rješenje za mjerenje utjecaja trebalo bi kombinirati mobilnu igru s drugim digitalnim i nedigitalnim aplikacijama koje pomažu korisnicima da prate svoju sanitarnu upotrebu uz njihov uspjeh u igri. - Lokalni graditelji mogu raditi u partnerstvu sa igrama za stručnjake za promjene, organizacije zajednice i telekomunikacijske kompanije kako bi testirali te pristupe.<br/><br/>Ovaj izvještaj istražuje potencijal korištenja mobilnih igara za uključivanje građana u rješavanje upornih izazova zajednice, ali želimo čuti od vas. Postoje li druge ideje kako igre mogu utjecati na promjenu ponašanja? |
| Sculpins, form a large family (300 species) of small northern fishes living on the bottom in both marine and fresh waters. Though primarily found in shallow waters, some species occur in depths to 1280 m. Approximately 16 species of sculpins exist from the Canadian Atlantic area. The se raven, longhorn, and shorthorn sculpin are the most popular species found in Newfoundland waters. Also known as gurnets, they are sometimes incorrectly called sea robins, grondin and gurnards, which are close relatives.<br/><br/>Sea Scallops: (Placopecten magellanicus)<br/><br/>Sea Scallops<br/><br/>They are also called giant or smooth scallops, are the most important commercial species of molluscan shellfish in Canada. They have two round shells, (with the commercial shell size ranging from 15 to 20 cm in diameter) nad are cream in color.<br/><br/>Sea scallops are found in the northwest Atlantic from the northern part of the Gulf of St. Lawrence to the coastal waters of North Carolina in the United States. In the northern part of this range, they occur in shallow water (less than 18 m) while in the southern portion, they are found in water deeper than 55 m.<br/><br/>The offshore fishery occurs on Georges Bank off the southwestern tip of Nova Scotia. Depending on the area, scallop fishing can be conducted on a year-round basis.<br/><br/>Sei Whale: (Balaenoptera borealis)<br/><br/>Too big to fit in one photo<br/><br/>14 meters; 13 tons.<br/><br/>The sei whale is often confused with the larger blue and fin whales. Its blow is similar to that of a fin whale, but lower and the sei's dorsal fin is more hooked.<br/><br/>The sei shows little of itself when surfacing, although it may poke its head out of the water, it only arches its back slightly and does not show its flukes before quietly submerging. The sei whale is all one slate gray color on top and may be lighter gray underneath.<br/><br/>Look for several blows in succession as the sei lays on the surface resting between its dives. It may be seen in groups of two to five off Newfoundland.<br/><br/>Shrimp (Pandalus borealis )<br/><br/>The little guy<br/><br/>During the 1990s, carapace length statistics of northern shrimp decreased in commercial and survey catches off Newfoundland and Labrador. Decreased growth rates caused by decreases in per-capita food availability due to large population increases, exacerbated by increased metabolic demands from higher water temperatures in the mid-1990s, appear to be the main cause of the size decrease. Fishing could have had an accelerating effect on environmentally driven decreases in shrimp growth and size by 'cropping' the largest shrimp from the population. The greatest decreases in shrimp size occurred in Hudson Strait and the adjacent northern shelf, the area which also has the highest densities and largest shrimp.<br/><br/>Silver Hake (Merluccius bilinearis)<br/><br/>Silver Hake<br/><br/>Silver Hake (Merluccius bilinearis)<br/><br/>Silver hake are members of the cod family, but are more slender and have two dorsal fins. They are dark gray with silver underparts. When freshly taken from the water, they are silvery iridescent, but the bright colour soon fades. Fish in the catch range from 20 to 30 cm in length and weigh between 0.1 and 0.3 kg.<br/><br/>Occurring from the Grand Banks to South Carolina, silver hake are mainly found on Georges Bank and on the Nova Scotia Banks, particularly on Browns Bank and the Sable Island Banks in depths of 55 to 275 m. Silver hake are generally found in the warmer waters of the Canadian Atlantic (7 to 10° C).<br/><br/>Formerly under-utilized in the Canadian fisheries and harvested mainly by fleets of other nations, silver hake were fished almost exclusively by Canadians using otter trawls in the late 1990s.<br/><br/>Silver Hake is sold in Baltimore as Lake Trout.<br/><br/>Skate (Raja senta) [smooth] (Raja radiata) [thorny]<br/><br/>An unpopular sea creature<br/><br/>The analysis of data for the St. Pierre Bank, which is to the south of Newfoundland, shows the average number of barndoor skate fell from about 0.6 million in the 1950s to fewer than 500 in the 1970s Meanwhile, smaller skate species, namely the horny skate and the smooth skate increased in biomass during the same interval. No barndoor skate have been caught on the St. Pierre Bank since the 1970s.<br/><br/>Smelt (Osmerus mordax)<br/><br/>Tiny Fish for Japan<br/><br/>Native to Newfoundland and Labrador. In the spring the sexually mature ripe smelt will leave either the sea or large lakes and travel up streams to spawn. In Newfoundland this can occur when the ice is still on many of the lakes. However, usually this occurs in March, April or May. The precise time depending on latitude and temperature, usually 8.90C is optimal.<br/><br/>It should be noted that the precise time of spawning is quite specific to the individual stream.<br/><br/>Spawning may last up to three weeks, but the peak seldom lasts more than a week. Spawning takes place at night with spawners returning to the lake or ocean by day . The length of both sexes will decrease in size as the period for spawning progresses. Two males will align themselves on either side of a ripe female. The female releases her eggs in clusters, with the milk of both males being released simultaneously. Eggs become adhesive shortly after extrusion, and attach to bottom gravel.<br/><br/>Snow Crab (Chionoecetes opilio)<br/><br/>Snow Crab<br/><br/>Snow crabs are common in the estuary and the Gulf of St. Lawrence, around Cape Breton Island and in the bays of Newfoundland, from Fortune Bay to White Bay. They are also found near Hamilton Bank off Labrador.<br/><br/>Snow crabs live most commonly on muddy or sand-mud bottoms at temperatures ranging from -0.5 to 4.5°C. In the Gulf of St. Lawrence, they are usually found at depths of 70 to 140 m, while in Cape Breton the depth varies from 45 to 245 m, and 170 to 380 m off Newfoundland. The distribution of small crabs is not well documented but they are occasionally found with the adults, or on gravelly bottoms at shallower depths. In some areas, there are indications that snow crabs move from gravel bottom to mud bottom, usually in deeper waters, as they reach maturity.<br/><br/>Sowerby's Beaked Whale (Mesopolodon bidens)<br/><br/>Where's the sexy lifeguard?<br/><br/>5 meters; 1.5 tons<br/><br/>It is also known as the north sea beaked whale, a rare whale of which little is known. It is thought to be mid-ocean whale which occasionally strays inshore feeding on squid and cod<br/><br/>The majority of whale strandings in the Western north Atlantic have occurred in Newfoundland and Labrador.<br/><br/>The Sowerby's is slate gray on the dorsal side and lighter gray on the ventral region. In adult males two teeth are often seen about one third of the way back on the beak erupted outside the mouth. The beak is around 50 cm long. One onlooker said the head looks like a thermos.<br/><br/>Sperm Whale: (Physeter catadon)<br/><br/>No jokes, please.<br/><br/>13 meters; 28 tons<br/><br/>The largest of the toothed whales is often referred to as "Moby Dick." Located at the front of its head, the single blowhole sends a slanted 5-meter misty spray out 45 degrees from its body. Its massive square head and the series of bumps that replace its dorsal fin easily identify the sperm whale It is slate gray. Sperm whales, like the humpback, will throw their tails high into the air when diving.<br/><br/>They are found offshore hunting for squid in deep water, but occasionally can be seen inshore singly or in small groups. | - Skulpini, formiraju veliku porodicu (300 vrsta) malih sjevernih riba koje žive na dnu i u morskim i u svježim vodama.

Najveći pad veličine škampa dogodio se u Hudsonovom tjesncu i susjednoj sjevernoj polici, području koje također ima najviše gustoće i najveće škampe.<br/><br/>Silver Hake (Merluccius bilinearis)<br/><br/>Srebrni Hake<br/><br/>Silver Hake (Merluccius bilinearis)<br/><br/>Srebrne hake su članovi porodice bakalara, ali su vitkiji i imaju dva leđna peraja, tamno sive su sa srebrnim donjem stranom, kada su svježe uzete iz vode, srebrne su iridescentne, ali svijetla boja ubrzo blijedi. - Ribe u ulovu se kreću od 20 do 30 cm dužine i teže između 0,1 i 0,3 kg.<br/><br/>- Pojavljujući se od Grand Banksa do Južne Karoline, srebrne hake se uglavnom nalaze na Georges banci i na Nova Scotia Banks, posebno na Browns banci i Sable Island Banks u dubinama od 55 do 275 m. Srebrne hake se općenito nalaze u toplijim vodama Kanadskog Atlantika (7 do 10 ° C).<br/><br/>Nekada nedovoljno iskorišteni u kanadskom ribarstvu i ubrani uglavnom flotama drugih nacija, srebrne hake lovili su gotovo isključivo Kanađani koristeći vidrene koće krajem 1990-ih.<br/><br/>Srebrni Hake prodaje se u Baltimoreu kao jezero Trout.<br/><br/>Skate (Raja senta) [Smooth] (Raja radiata) [Thorny]<br/><br/>\"Nepopularno morsko stvorenje\"<br/><br/>- Analiza podataka za banku St. Pierre, koja je na jugu Newfoundlanda, pokazuje prosječan broj klizaljki u staji pala je s oko 0,6 milijuna 1950-ih na manje od 500 1970-ih U međuvremenu, manje vrste klizača, naime napaljena klizaljka i glatka klizaljka povećana je u biomasi tijekom istog intervala. Na St. Pierre banci od 1970-ih nisu uhvaćene rolere na stajskim vratima.<br/><br/>- Smelt (Osmerus mordax)<br/><br/>- Sićušna riba za Japan<br/><br/>U proljeće će spolno zreli topionik napustiti more ili velika jezera i putovati uz potoke kako bi se mrijestio. Međutim, obično se to događa u ožujku, travnju ili svibnju. Precizno vrijeme ovisno o zemljopisnoj širini i temperaturi, obično 8,90C je optimalno.<br/><br/>Treba napomenuti da je precizno vrijeme mrijesta prilično specifično za pojedini tok.<br/><br/>Spawning može trajati do tri tjedna, ali vrhunac rijetko traje više od tjedan dana. Spawning se odvija noću s mrijestiteljima koji se vraćaju u jezero ili ocean danju . Dužina oba spola smanjit će se u veličini kao period za mriještenje napreduje. Ženka pušta jaja u grozdovima, a mlijeko oba mužjaka istovremeno se oslobađa, a jaja postaju ljepila ubrzo nakon ekstruzije i pričvršćuju se na dno šljunka.<br/><br/>Snježni rak (Chionoecetes opilio)<br/><br/>Snježna rakovica<br/><br/>Snježni rakovi su česti u ušću i zaljevu St. Lawrence, oko otoka Cape Breton i u zaljevima Newfoundland, od zaljeva Fortune do White Baya.<br/><br/>Snježne rakove najčešće žive na blatnjavim ili pješčanim dnom na temperaturama u rasponu od -0,5 do 4,5°C. - U zaljevu St. Lawrence obično se nalaze na dubinama od 70 do 140 m, dok u rtu Breton dubina varira od 45 do 245 m, a 170 do 380 m od Newfoundlanda. - Raspodjela malih rakova nije dobro dokumentirana ali se povremeno nalaze sa odraslima, ili na šljunkovitim dnom na plićim dubinama. U nekim područjima postoje naznake da se snježni rakovi kreću od šljunka do blata, obično u dubljim vodama, kako dostižu zrelost.<br/><br/>Sowerby's Beaked Whale (Mezopolodon bidens)<br/><br/>Gde je seksi spasilac?<br/><br/>5 metara; 1,5 tona<br/><br/>Smatra se da je to srednjooceanski kit koji povremeno luta po unutrašnjosti hraneći se lignjama i bakalarom.<br/><br/>Većina kitova u zapadnom sjevernom Atlantiku dogodila se u Newfoundlandu i Labradoru.<br/><br/>- Sowerby je škriljevcasto siva na dorsalnoj strani i svjetlija siva na ventralnoj regiji. kod odraslih mužjaka se često vide dva zuba oko trećine puta natrag na kljunu koji je eruptirao izvan usta.Kljun je dug oko 50 cm. - Jedan posmatrač je rekao da glava izgleda kao termos.<br/><br/>Sperma Whale: (Physeter katadon)<br/><br/>- Bez šala, molim vas.<br/><br/>13 metara; 28 tona<br/><br/>Najveći od zubatih kitova često se naziva Moby Dick smješten na prednjoj strani glave, jedan otvor za puhanje šalje ukoso 5-metarski magloviti sprej od 45 stupnjeva iz tijela. Njegova masivna četvrtasta glava i niz kvrga koje zamjenjuju leđnu peraju lako identificiraju kita spermatozoida To je škriljevca siva. kitovi sperme, poput grbavog kita, bacit će repove visoko u zrak prilikom ronjenja.<br/><br/>- Pronalaze se offshore u lovu na lignje u dubokoj vodi, ali se povremeno mogu vidjeti u unutrašnjosti pojedinačno ili u malim grupama. |
