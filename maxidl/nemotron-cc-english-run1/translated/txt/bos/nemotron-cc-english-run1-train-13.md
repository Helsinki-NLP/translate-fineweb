| Sleep Clinic<br/><br/>The sleep disorders program evaluates and treats children and adults affected by sleep-related problems such as insomnia, sleep apnea, narcolepsy and other hypersomnias, parasomnias and night time enuresis. The residents see patients during sleep disorders clinic hours.<br/><br/>During this rotation, the residents are exposed to a wide variety of sleep disorders. They are trained to investigate and evaluate their own patient care experiences pertaining to sleep evaluations with appraisal and assimilation of current scientific evidence. The residents work closely with sleep disorder faculty physicians and acquire the skills to formulate and communicate with patients and families about their diagnostic assessment and management plan, including neuropharmacology. Providing care plans to other physicians and care providers either verbally or via letter/note is an integral part of the program. | Klinika za spavanje<br/><br/>Program poremećaja spavanja ocjenjuje i liječi djecu i odrasle na koje utječu problemi povezani sa spavanjem kao što su nesanica, apneja u snu, narkolepsija i druge hipersomnije, parasomnije i noćna enureza. - Stanovnici primaju pacijente za vrijeme klinike za poremećaje spavanja.<br/><br/>Za vrijeme ove rotacije stanovnici su izloženi raznim poremećajima spavanja.

| Truly Handsfree Bluetooth Headset Takes Voice Commands<br/><br/>Most Bluetooth headsets are perfectly capable of the voice dial thing, assuming that the connected mobile phone can do it, but the BlueAnt V1 takes voice control to a new high. The incredibly compact Bluetooth headset is being marketed as the first ever with a true voice-based user interface.<br/><br/>Instead of clicking a physical button to answer your calls, you simply speak into the microphone and say "accept call". Other basic voice commands could include "volume up", "reject call", or "do the laundry". Okay, maybe it won't do that last thing, but you can see how a completely handsfree experience like that offered by the BlueAnt V1 can be excellent for drivers and other people who need their hands. That is why you're using a Bluetooth headset in the first place.<br/><br/>The downside is that the voice control can be "wonky" and it can be quite frustrating when you accidentally give it a command that you don't want it to do. What happens if you're in a call with someone and you happens to say "end call"? | \"Iskreno bez ruku Bluetooth slušalice preuzima glasovne komande\"<br/><br/>Većina Bluetooth slušalica savršeno je sposobna za biranje glasa, pod pretpostavkom da spojeni mobilni telefon to može, ali BlueAnt V1 prenosi glasovnu kontrolu na novi nivo. - Nevjerojatno kompaktni Bluetooth slušalice se plasiraju na tržište kao prvi ikada sa pravim glasom baziranim korisničkim sučeljem.<br/><br/>Umjesto da kliknete na fizičko dugme da odgovorite na pozive, jednostavno govorite u mikrofon i kažete \"prihvati poziv\" Druge osnovne glasovne naredbe mogu uključivati \"Voluminiraj se\" ili \"odbaci poziv\" ili \"operi rublje\" Možda to neće učiniti to zadnje, ali možete vidjeti kako takvo iskustvo bez ruku koje nudi BlueAnt V1 može biti odlično za vozače i druge ljude kojima trebaju ruke. - Zato i koristiš Bluetooth slušalice.<br/><br/>Loša strana je da kontrola glasa može biti neobična i može biti prilično frustrirajuća kada joj slučajno daš naredbu koju ne želiš da uradi. |
| Wednesday, July 06, 2005<br/><br/>Going to college? DREAM on<br/><br/>Here is another great article about our failing (and increasingly ridiculous) immigration system, this time from the Boston Globe. A 18-year undocumented immigrant from Massachusetts was awarded a four-year scholarship at any state university because of her high test scores, but this was later rescinded once state officials found out about her immigration status. As the author of the article so rightly says,<br/><br/>"So much for celebrating the building blocks for success and the American dream. Romney says, tough luck if you are smart, hardworking, and the child of illegal immigrants."<br/><br/>It's beyond me why anyone wants to keep smart, high-achieving kids like this one out of college. Does anybody really think that denying in-state tuition and scholarships to undocumented immigrants will make any potential immigrants think twice about coming here to work? Or are policies like these motivated by fear? Despite the increasingly widespread movement in favor of the DREAM Act and state laws (see this previous post) to allow undocumented students to pay in-state tuition, it seems like the power of fear is growing.<br/><br/>It's interesting that Mass. Gov. Romney is bashing undocumented immigrants now - this article in the Economist shows how his campaign to end gay marriage in Massachusetts is closely linked to his anticipated run for the presidency in 2008. Here in New York, presumed Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton has gone to the right on immigration, claiming that she is "adamantly against illegal immigrants." It's unfortunate that the way to get ahead in politics (particularly in the red states) is to blame immigrants for our problems. It will be interesting to see if an increased Latino turnout in places like the Southwest will prove Hillary wrong.<br/><br/>3 comments:<br/><br/>Maybe people do not want illegal aliens to get scholarhips for the following reasons:<br/><br/>1. Their parents violated the law to enter the country. 2. Their parents had to steal someone's identity to work in this country. 3. Their parents have to cheat on their income taxes (and other taxes) to stay here. 4. Their parents had to lie to get their children admitted. 5. their parents lied on applications for things like free lunch.<br/><br/>First, the Supreme Court ruled in 1982 that all children have the right to public education regardless of immigration status. Schools are prohibited from asking about a child's immigration status, meaning that undocumented parents do not have to "lie" to get their kids free lunch.<br/><br/>Second, many immigrants do not have to use another identity or cheat on income taxes in order to work here -- many employers knowingly hire undocumented immigrants (this has been happening for some time - the 1986 Imm. Reform and Control Act's attempted to deal with it, and many anti-immigrant advocates argue that employer sanctions need to be strengthened today) and quite a few immigrants pay income taxes and other taxes that they never end up receiving the benefits of (the New York Times reported that illegal immigrants provide social security with a subsidy of $7 billion a year).<br/><br/>Finally, if the biggest problem with undocumented immigrants is that they are breaking the law by being here, should that same standard be applied to businesses that knowingly hire them (which, by the way, is also against the law even though it is rarely enforced)? Should the kids of these businesspeople be denied the same opportunities because their parents broke the law? Could we extend this argument to the children of everyone who has ever broken the law in this country?<br/><br/>Whatever you think about illegal immigration, the point is that the kids should not be punished for their parents' decisions to come here. Especially when these bright and hardworking undocumented students have the potential to contribute so much to our society. | Srijeda, 06. juli 2005.<br/><br/>-Ideš na koledž?<br/><br/>- Evo još jednog sjajnog članka o našem neuspjelom (i sve smiješnijem) imigracijskom sustavu, ovaj put iz Boston Globea. 18-godišnja nedokumentovana imigrantkinja iz Massachusettsa dobila je četverogodišnju stipendiju na bilo kojem državnom sveučilištu zbog svojih visokih rezultata na testovima, ali to je kasnije ukinuto nakon što su državni dužnosnici saznali za njezin imigracijski status. Kao što autor članka tako s pravom kaže,<br/><br/>Romney kaže, loša sreća ako ste pametni, marljivi i dijete ilegalnih imigranata.<br/><br/>Ne mogu da zamislim zašto neko želi da zadrži pametnu, bogatu decu kao što je ova sa koledža. Da li iko stvarno misli da će poricanje školarine i stipendija za nedokumentovane imigrante naterati neke potencijalne imigrante da dvaput razmisle o dolasku ovamo na posao ili su takve politike motivisane strahom? Usprkos sve raširenijem kretanju u korist Zakona o snu i državnih zakona (vidi ovaj prethodni post) kako bi se studentima koji nisu dokumentirani dozvolilo da plaćaju školarinu u državi, čini se da moć straha raste.<br/><br/>Romney sada napada nedokumentovane imigrante - ovaj članak u Ekonomisti pokazuje kako je njegova kampanja za okončanje gay brakova u Massachusettsu usko povezana s njegovom očekivanom kandidaturom za predsjedništvo 2008. godine. Ovde u Njujorku, pretpostavlja se da je demokratska frontunka Hilari Klinton skrenula desno na imigraciju, tvrdeći da je ona...dostojanstveno protiv ilegalnih imigranata. Na žalost, način da se napreduje u politici (osobito u crvenim državama) je da se krive imigranti za naše probleme.<br/><br/>3 komentara:<br/><br/>Možda ljudi ne žele ilegalne vanzemaljce da dobiju učenjake iz sljedećih razloga:<br/><br/>Njihovi roditelji su prekršili zakon da bi ušli u zemlju. 2. Njihovi roditelji su morali ukrasti nečiji identitet da bi radili u ovoj zemlji. 3. Njihovi roditelji moraju varati na porezima na dohodak (i drugim porezima) da bi ostali ovdje. 4. - Njihovi roditelji su morali lagati da bi primili djecu. 5. Njihovi roditelji su lagali na molbama za besplatnu hranu.<br/><br/>Prvo, Vrhovni sud je 1982. donio odluku da sva djeca imaju pravo na javno obrazovanje bez obzira na imigracijski status. Školama je zabranjeno da pitaju o imigracijskom statusu djeteta, što znači da nedokumentirani roditelji ne moraju lagati da bi dobili svoju djecu besplatan ručak.<br/><br/>- Drugo, mnogi imigranti ne moraju koristiti drugi identitet ili varati poreze na dohodak da bi radili ovdje - mnogi poslodavci svjesno zapošljavaju nedokumentirane imigrante (ovo se događa već neko vrijeme - Imm iz 1986. Reformski i kontrolni akt pokušava se nositi s tim, a mnogi zagovornici anti-imigranata tvrde da sankcije poslodavaca danas trebaju biti ojačane) i da dosta imigranata plaća poreze na dohodak i druge poreze od kojih nikada ne dobivaju koristi (New York Times je izvijestio da ilegalni imigranti osiguravaju socijalno osiguranje subvencijom od 7 milijardi dolara godišnje).<br/><br/>Na kraju, ako je najveći problem s nedokumentiranim imigrantima da krše zakon time što su ovdje, bi li se taj isti standard trebao primjenjivati i na poduzeća koja ih svjesno zapošljavaju (koja su, usput, također protuzakonita iako se rijetko provode)? Možemo li proširiti ovaj argument na djecu svih onih koji su prekršili zakon u ovoj zemlji?<br/><br/>- Šta god da mislite o ilegalnoj imigraciji, poenta je da decu ne treba kažnjavati zbog odluka njihovih roditelja da dođu ovde. Posebno kada ovi bistri i marljivi nedokumentovani studenti imaju potencijal da toliko pridonose našem društvu. |

| ΑΛΗΘΩΣ<br/><br/>Corporations are not people and money is not speech<br/><br/>In Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned century-old restrictions on corporate spending in elections under the guise of protecting First Amendment free speech rights. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, writing for the majority, said, "If the First Amendment has any force, it prohibits Congress from fining or jailing citizens, or associations of citizens, for simply engaging in political speech." This argument of the majority decision rests on the notions that corporations are covered by the same free speech protections as individual citizens and that campaign donations or financing are the same as speech.<br/><br/>Corporations, however, are inherently not the same as individuals and thus cannot have the same protections as individuals. There are a slew of laws that protect corporations and their interests in the arena for which they are by definition formed—namely the marketplace. The laws that govern corporations and the rights enjoyed by them are distinct from the laws and rights of individuals. A corporation, for example, can enter into contracts like an individual, but unlike an individual, a corporation's members can be protected by limited liability so their personal assets are not at stake.<br/><br/>If a corporation, then, is a distinct legal entity governed by different laws than an individual is, corporations are not protected under the First Amendment in the same way that individuals are protected. Corporations, especially in their most powerful and wealthy incarnations, are exponentially more influential than most individuals in America. The restrictions on corporate spending in elections that were overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court were meant to redress this power balance between average individuals and unduly influential businesses. Corporations already have a plethora of ways to influence politics, from political action committees to lobbyists on Capitol Hill. The framers of the Bill of Rights wanted to protect the voices of the trampled, not amplify the voices of the elite.<br/><br/>The other part of the Supreme Court's premise for its decision is that the First Amendment free speech clause applies to campaign funding. While speech can be interpreted loosely as any form of expression, such an open, ambiguous definition would create a myriad of problems with all kinds of laws. An architect has a vision of a building: it is his art, his self expression, yet he cannot ignore local zoning laws that, for instance, restrict the height of his building. Should he sue the state for violation of his free speech, his right to expression? Equating money with speech also opens the door to sundry ludicrous claims by, for instance, an employer who objects to minimum wage laws since he'd like to express that his employees are only worth paying $3 an hour. There have to be restrictions on what constitutes speech to prevent a bastardization of the term and an overly liberal interpretation of the First Amendment.<br/><br/>A corporation already has the power to issue a statement in favor of a candidate or policy through its political action committees, and individual members of a business are welcome to contribute money as well. However, allowing a corporation to use its vast profits to directly finance the election or to remove a candidate compromises the democratic notion of a free and fair election. There are unseemly ties even now between politicians and various industries, but this new ruling would make such connections more robust and give them a veneer of legitimacy. A politician financed by a business would become completely beholden to its political agenda and not to the voters.<br/><br/>It's not only the independence of politicians that's at stake, but also the independence of our judges, who are at the very least expected to be impartial. Many states still use elections to appoint judges, which leaves them vulnerable to the influence of political spending. In a recent speech at a law school conference, former Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor worried about the impact of corporate campaign funding in judicial elections, saying that "judicial campaigning makes last week's decision in Citizens United an increasing problem for maintaining an independent judiciary."<br/><br/>Two cornerstones of our democracy—free elections and an independent judiciary—are threatened by the Supreme Court's activist and meddling decision. The case could have been decided much more narrowly in favor of Citizens United, but instead, the majority of the justices decided to expand the case to champion the rights of big money over the interest of the American people. Senators Dick Durbin (D-IL) and Arlen Specter (D-PA) introduced the Fair Elections Now Act last March. It would prohibit contributions from political action committees and would match individual donations, limited to $100, on a 4:1 basis so that fundraising focuses on the people. Such a system has been in place in New York City since the 1988 Campaign Finance Act. The rest of the country is long overdue to follow. Never before has the fight for public financing been more necessary.<br/><br/>The author is a Columbia College junior majoring in political science. She is a prospective law student.<br/><br/>The 14th amendment, which was one of the Reconstruction amendments added following the War of Northern Aggression was never legally ratified by the States and has caused more problems than all the other post-war amendments combined. If my memory serves me right, corporations were declared by the Supreme Court to be 14th Amemdment citizens during the late 1800s or early 1900s. In case you are unfamiliar with the wording of this amendment, it basically made everyone a citizen (and subject) of the United States. Prior to the War, all individuals were citizens of the State within which they resided and no one was a citizen of the United States nor were they subject to the jurisdiction of the United States except for those who resided in the District of Columbia or resided within one of the territories under the jurisdiction of the United States. The main purposes of the War of Northern Aggression was to destroy the soverienty of the individual States and reduce the status of every American to that of a subject under the control and jurisdiction of the United States government. The founding fathers set up our government as a loose confederation of Sovereign States with the States exercising all meaningful polical power. They never invisioned or intended any effective political power to reside in Washington. Things will only get much worse until We the People throw the theives and money changers out of Washington and restore our government back to what it once was.<br/><br/>The word person means corporation in law. It is not that corporations are not people, it is that people are not corporations. We have been tricked into accepting a corporate identity[ALL CAPS]. Look at your drivers license. Every time we go to court,we go as a corporation, not as a natural person.The first corporations were governments. Looked at logically, limited liability for a corporation is the extension of sovereign immunity to the king after he was no longer king. The same ruling elite families are still in control and that goes all the way back to the first known about extraterrestrials[anunaki] that the Sumerian documents talk about.The same group also take the credit or blame for all the religions and secret societies.<br/><br/>What difference does it make? Really. Think about it, the whole entire Congress and Senate are a dog and pony show, the real power brokers who control it all are in the shadows, working the deals, doing what they want, with the AL-CIA-DA and MOSSAD out there killing everyone who disagrees with these shadow government assholes who truly run it all.<br/><br/>So, why is it so important now to be so upset over this shit? Why now? After more than two hundred years of absolute proof that the politicians are just a fancy hand puppet show to distract us from the REAL WHEELING AND DEALING IN THE BACK ROOMS elsewhere, why does it matter now that the total contempt of democracy is being demonstrated by SCOTUS in this ruling? The assholes on this court know that the real guys with their hands on the power levers of the system aren't in the Congress and the Senate.<br/><br/>When the Rule of Law became OBSOLETE in the world, in general, and everything became more or less ROLLERBALL only this time, on STEROIDS, for and by the CORPORATIONS, why did this sole ruling make all that much difference? Why do all of you assholes think that this 'lagging' indicator of the end of any semblances of democratic government makes any difference.<br/><br/>Hypothetically, let's say this ruling had not happened. Do any of you think that the corporations and the moneyed influences in the shadows wouldn't have continued to exert any and all of their will on the rest of us?<br/><br/>For those of you who think it'd been different, I suggest you find a remedy to your TOTAL NAIVETE!!!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>this ruling didn't make one iota of a difference. It was always like this, long before SCOTUS basically said to corporations; "go ahead, do what the fuck you want…the little people are just cannon fodder for your wars, chattel for you to barter and sell at your leisure.."<br/><br/>democracy was always an illusion. We never ever had any control, ever. making such a mountain out of this mole hill is absolutely unwarranted, in light of the fact that for the whole entire 230 year history of this republic, the fat cats and the rich oligarchs never needed any Congress or Senate to do what they pleased, under any circumstances, ever. They just did it.<br/><br/>The government you were looking at was a chimera, not real..<br/><br/>the sooner you all come to that realization, the sooner we can get on with less pissing and moaning over a mere joke of a technicality that was always the case from day one, and was not foisted on us by the SCOTUS, the court only quite belatedly declared to us what has been happening for a long long long, corrupt time.<br/><br/>I've got a mad crush on Exxon, and Exxon has one on me, wedding bells in the spring – a bit quick I know, but our love can't be denied. Exxon is a little shy, so don't expect any public announcements, we're thinking a quiet wedding in Reno.<br/><br/>Any business is simply a group of individuals (small or large) exercising their individual rights collectively. Therefore, any business has the same rights as those individuals (except, of course, the right to vote, which is reserved to the individuals themselves). The freedom to dispose of one's wealth as one sees fit comes along with the freedom to earn it. If an aggregate of individuals has earned money, it should be free to decide how do dispose of that money. The real problem is not that businesses can donate to campaigns, it is that the government has been allowed to meddle in business – i.e. that the government can grant some favor in return for that money. We need separation of commerce and state in the same way and for the same reasons as we have separation of church and state. I also find it interesting that the author chose as examples two laws (zoning and minimum wage) that also violate individual rights. The first violates property rights and the second violates the rights of individuals to contract freely.<br/><br/>under your jackoffian analysis, nobody should interfere with anything anyone does at all. say, if I were in a crowd, with a saturday night special, and I want to 'free speech' your butt with it much in the same way the CIA free speeched Bobby Kennedy in L.A. one night, that's fine, because to interfere with me is interfering with my right to free speech you.<br/><br/>that's the critical flaw with you libertarian assholes….you think that there is no societal role for any rule of law, that anything that fits under 'ends justify means' rationale shouldn't ever be interfered with, just let everyone do whatever they so choose, and it all works out. That Ayn Rand bullshit doesn't work, dude! It works right up to the point where someone else pays a price for your 'whatever i wanna do' freedom crosses a line and then interfere with my freedom.<br/><br/>rules and laws SHOULD exist in the framework of society strictly to keep in check that good old "I can do anything I want to and it's just me being free" line of horse shit.<br/><br/>Corporations do not have any rights, dorkus! globally, they have been the reason why there are so many failed states, pillaged by the will of corporatocrats based in the U.S.S.A. who think that freedom of their speech translates into; "do what we tell you or we'll bomb you to get your resources we need" kind of raping and pillaging.<br/><br/>someday, I hope some asshole fucks you with their 'free speech' and then we'll hear your sorry ass whine about how the law let you down. What law? In your libertarian world of 'I can do what I want', the only rule of law is the one you make up to justify your end goal. For you then, it'll be fun to see how you cope with some other asshole's interpretation of your boundary being just a little bit of a mere inconvenience for his goals, which didn't necessarily respect your boundaries at all, for damned sure!<br/><br/>Someone by the name of "uh huh, right.." might have a logical point hidden in the forest of name-calling and straw-man abuse, but how about this: Corporations are inventions of the State that are created to pass some of the risks of doing business from the people running the business over to the stockholders (if any), the customers (if any) and the public. So if a corporation commits a fraud, it is the corporation that's punished (usually) and fined and the people who run the corporation get to walk away with a golden handshake. And the cost of the fine is passed along to the customers and paid to the government (not the victims!). To "David"s point, if we were to separate government and commerce, corporations would cease to exist! Not a bad idea.<br/><br/>I think that the point is, that if a corporation commits a financial crime, and nobody notices (the if the tree falls in the forest and nobody hears it, did it truly make a noise argument) then did a crime actually take place?<br/><br/>and in a veitch diagram, where the two blobs collide and interact, if one encroaches on the other one's boundary, who is the arbiter of who got violated?<br/><br/>my point is this: there are no straw man arguments with regard to david's asinine assessment that corporations can do whatever they want with abandon. the truth of the matter is, granting corporations, and oligarchs, or whomever, a license to do what they want, whenever they want, under the premise that THEY ARE INDIVIDUALS and hence, guaranteed FREE SPEECH, is both absurd and horse shit.<br/><br/>corporations are made up of groups of people. people who should live by some semblance of Rule of Law. When they don't have to, then it's "I can do anything I want as long as nobody catches me or holds me accountable for my transgressions" going on here.<br/><br/>if that's the world David wants to live in, let him go there and make it happen, but goddamn it, don't expect me not to fucking object to that shit!<br/><br/>We can all get along, just as long as boundaries are not gratuitously violated at will by anyone who thinks their right to do what they want actually nullifies my right not to be interfered with by their actions.<br/><br/>with regard to corporations, they have no right to violate my rights, or yours, or anyone elses. If they can't function in the community as a benevolent and hence, non interfering entity, then they have no right to exist.<br/><br/>and David wasn't being threatened. he's an asshole for asserting that "do what you want, it's freedom of speech" is a bunch of horse shit. It's la la land bullshit. And I object to anyone or anything violating my boundaries with that free speech assertion. That's a crock of shit and you know it is!<br/><br/>Well, that was a colorful response. Sadly, "uh-uh", you are way off the mark. I never said people have the right to infringe on anyone else's rights…and I repudiate "ends justify the means" thinking. Yes, laws SHOULD exist, but ONLY to PROTECT the rights of people. I'm sorry you have such a warped and horribly incorrect view of my argument.<br/><br/>your point well taken, David. I apologize for peeing in your corn flakes. I think I thought you were inferring that corporations were able to do whatever they pleased under this right of FREEDOM OF SPEECH, which in Amerk'a is a joke today because the PATRIOT ACT and a non-declared state of MARTIAL LAW we've been living under since Sept. 2001, has given the government the ability to suspend and or 'shred' the U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights.<br/><br/>sadly, people have only a few rights. we have the right to be taxed to the point of absurdity. we have the right to be conscripted and become cannon fodder for oligarch wars. and we have the right to shut the fuck up and be quiet while we are being joy boinked by corporations and oligarchs and bankers. those are our rights, and sadly, they truly SUCKETH, David. I think we can agree on that!<br/><br/>I'm still wondering how the newbie, Roberts, inherited the Chief Justiceship after Rhenquist rather than that role going to someone with more experience on the bench. What does "The Roberts Court" plan to do next, though, for corporations? Give them the right to vote at the polls like real people?; perhaps have votes by human beings counted as 3/5 of a person or less to their 1?<br/><br/>I haven't read all of the 183-page booklength "ruling" yet but find these appalling statements therein to be not only contradictory to their expansive actions in this case but also something of an abdication of their duty:<br/><br/>"the gravest and most delicate duty that this Court is called upon to perform." Blodgett v. Holden, 275 U. S. 142, 147–148 (1927) (Holmes, J., concurring). Because the stakes are so high, our standard practice is to refrain from addressing constitutional questions except when necessary to rule on particular claims before us. See Ashwander v. TVA, 297 U. S. 288, 346–348 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concur-ring). This policy underlies both our willingness to construe ambiguous statutes to avoid constitutional problems and our practice "'never to formulate a rule of constitutional law broader than is required by the precise facts to which it is to be applied.'" United States v. Raines, 362<br/>U. S. 17, 21 (1960) (quoting Liverpool, New York & Philadelphia S. S. Co. v. Commissioners of Emigration, 113<br/>U. S. 33, 39 (1885)).<br/>The majority and dissent are united in expressing allegiance to these principles. Ante, at 12; post, at 14 (STEVENS, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). >><br/><br/>Roberts, by virtue of his lies during CONfirmation by the DEMS who shoved his lying ass thru the process at mach speed, needs to be 'impeached' for being a fucking liar. He specifically stated he would not go this route of writing decisions not based on settled, non controversial concepts of the U.S. Constitution…and here clearly he has done exactly the opposite of that.<br/><br/>The real blame should be on the shoulders of the cocksuckers in the SENATE that confirmed the son of a bitch in the first place, stating they wouldn't vote against his confirmation because they were saving their ammo for REAL THREATS TO US..<br/><br/>I blame the fucking DINOCRATS more than I blame this lying pile of shit named Roberts. Pricks like SCHUMER and that other asshole from Illinois, and that lying zionist bastard Levin from Michigan. Just a couple of them holding their ground could have stopped the confirmation of Alito, and then Roberts. But they let it slide.<br/><br/>the assertion that all of this is indeed window dressing is a correct one, and the truth is, though blatantly a violation of our rights across the board, these scum in the SCOTUS are only post fact, asserting the screwing they were doing to us for a long, long, long time.<br/><br/>the truth is, it never mattered what we thought was going on, because Corporations have been functioning well outside the law for a long time now, and nobody has held them accountable. the very bastards that sit on the SCOTUS are benefactors of the wrongdoing and greed of the corporations who provide kickbacks to them for their decisions, in the form of STOCK DIVIDENDS.<br/><br/>unfortunately, focusing on the corrupt SCOTUS doesn't help us much. It's like stating the obvious, and expecting it to be punishable, when it is not.<br/><br/>we are fucked no matter how we look at it, but there will be a day of atonement. Once they take away every last vestige of personal dignity of the entire middle class in this country, there will be hell to pay. There will be a violent, bloody backlash the likes of which has only been seen in France, but eventually will come home to roost here.<br/><br/>Communists have long been in the business of fomenting class war along economic lines and brackets. Try to think more in terms of the Constitutionalist Class than the "middle class" as their linguists prefer. Works better, imo, to throw them off their gameplans.<br/><br/>what is happening now is a quickening in the realization by the Sheeple that something is seriously wrong, and that the facade and the illusion are wearing thin and falling down, revealing the ugly, multi tentacled ROTHSCHILD beast behind the corporatocracy push for more power and absolute rule.<br/><br/>as the 'middle class' or whatever you want to call it, gets increasingly decimated and destroyed, ultimately enough Sheeple will have awakened to the point where they realize it's either stand up and fight or die on all fours.<br/><br/>the system ROTHSCHILDS is collapsing in on itself, due to way too much out of control, unchecked GREED, and now, it's like a tall building going back and forth like a pendulum in an earthquake, at some point it will finally 'snap' and fall. we're in the end game, as you will, of democracy and the faux economic system that was being perpetrated upon everyone, so there's a collision with REALITY about to happen pretty soon, and it will not be pretty.<br/><br/>IF I were SCOTUS, I'd be making sure those biz jets are fueled, pilots standing by, for their final PARAGUAYAN trip to the Bush compound where they'll hide once the balloon finally goes up here.<br/><br/>but increasingly, it looks like they're pushing hard for World War III to take everyone's eyes off the mind blowing, incredible HUBRIS of their ilk.<br/><br/>a day of reckoning is indeed coming. And it will not be pretty.<br/><br/>Comment by what I think is happening now is this.. &#124;<br/>February 2, 2010<br/>&#124; Reply<br/><br/>I agree that the collapsing systems are theirs, not America's, and check out this link from Rense.com:<br/><br/>Looks kinda like the ugly, multi tentacled ROTHSCHILD beast behind the corporatocracy is trying to disguise itself as an offshore oil rig or something, doesn't it?<br/><br/>In their push for WWIII, they're also pushing for an insurrection here to throw out the Constitution in exasperation and contempt so that they can replace it with their own designs. Sounds like Treason to me.<br/><br/>In my own idea and understanding there have to be restrictions on what constitutes speech to prevent a bastardization of the term and an overly liberal interpretation of the First Amendment..Great post!!<br/><br/>4 We need not reach the question whether the Government has a compelling interest in preventing foreign individuals or associations from influencing our Nation's political process. Cf. 2 U. S. C. §441e (contribution and expenditure ban applied to "foreign national[s]"). Section 441b is not limited to corporations or associations that were created in foreign countries or funded predominantly by foreign shareholders. Section 441b therefore would be overbroad even if we assumed, arguendo, that the Government has a compelling interest in limiting foreign influence over our political process. See Broadrick, 413<br/>U. S., at 615. >><br/><br/>The US went bankrupt when FDR called in the gold. We had no more gold to pay for the paper we borrowed from the FED. It is now in a yearly bankruptcy rollover. The government is now private like BLACKWATER. All government agencies are listed on DUNN AND BRADSTREET. The common law which the constitution specifies pertains to natural people. All business by the courts today is corporate meaning that we are viewed as individual corporations. We exist by contract with the state. Remember the 14th amendment. There were no US citizens before that. Most of us have unwittingly claimed US corporate citizenship. We need to address the rule by the banking elite.Almost all leading REPS and DEMS are members of the COUNCIL OF FOREIGN RELATIONS or the TLC. LOok up the history of who started and controls these. Rush, Glenn and Sean are all liars and banker bootlickers. Obama is a puppet for the CFR. 911 truth has a great deal more bearing and would serve to unite the honest people in this country.<br/><br/>I don't really believe I'm a corporation or the citizen of one but, if the gubbermint thinks so, does the SCOTUS ruling mean that there are no more campaign contribution limits on anyone, businesses or individuals? I'd rather see money removed from our electoral process altogether — equal time on America's airwaves given at no charge for all candidates | âTMa âTMa âTMa âTMa âTMa âTMa âTMa âTMa âTMa âTMa âTMa âTMa âTMa âTMa<br/><br/>Korporacije nisu ljudi i novac nije govor<br/><br/>U Građani Ujedinjeni protiv Savezne izborne komisije Vrhovni sud SAD-a poništio je stoljetna ograničenja korporativne potrošnje na izborima pod krinkom zaštite prava na slobodu govora Prvog amandmana. Sudac Anthony M. Kennedy, pišući za većinu, rekao je, \"Ako Prvi amandman ima bilo kakvu silu, zabranjuje Kongresu da kažnjava ili zatvara građane, ili udruženja građana, zbog jednostavnog sudjelovanja u političkom govoru.\" Ovaj argument većinske odluke počiva na pojmovima da su korporacije obuhvaćene istom zaštitom slobodnog govora kao i pojedini građani te da su donacije ili financiranje kampanje isto što i govor.<br/><br/>- Korporacije, međutim, inherentno nisu iste kao pojedinci i na taj način ne mogu imati istu zaštitu kao pojedinci. Postoji mnoštvo zakona koji štite korporacije i njihove interese u areni za koju su po definiciji formirani - naime tržište. Zakoni koji uređuju korporacije i prava koja uživaju od njih razlikuju se od zakona i prava pojedinaca. - Korporacija, na primjer, može ući u ugovore kao pojedinac, ali za razliku od pojedinca, članovi korporacije mogu biti zaštićeni ograničenom odgovornošću tako da njihova osobna imovina nije u pitanju.<br/><br/>Ako je korporacija, dakle, različita pravna osoba kojom upravljaju različiti zakoni nego pojedinac, korporacije nisu zaštićene Prvim amandmanom na isti način na koji su pojedinci zaštićeni. - Korporacije, posebno u svojim najmoćnijim i najbogatijim inkarnacijama, eksponencijalno su utjecajnije od većine pojedinaca u Americi. - Ograničenja korporativne potrošnje na izborima koji su poništeni od strane Vrhovnog suda SAD-a bila su namjenjena da se ova ravnoteža moći ispravi između prosječnih pojedinaca i neopravdano utjecajnih poduzeća. Korporacije već imaju mnoštvo načina utjecaja na politiku, od političkih akcijskih odbora do lobista na Capitol Hillu.<br/><br/>Drugi dio premise Vrhovnog suda za njegovu odluku je da se klauzula o slobodi govora Prvog amandmana odnosi na financiranje kampanje. - Dok se govor može tumačiti labavo kao bilo koji oblik izražavanja, takva otvorena, dvosmislena definicija stvorila bi bezbroj problema sa svim vrstama zakona. - Arhitekt ima viziju zgrade: to je njegova umjetnost, samoizražavanje, a ipak ne može zanemariti lokalne zakone o zoniranju koji, na primjer, ograničavaju visinu njegove zgrade. Zagovaranje novca govorom također otvara vrata sunčanim apsurdnim tvrdnjama poslodavca koji se protivi zakonima o minimalnoj plaći jer želi izraziti da su njegovi zaposlenici vrijedni plaćanja samo 3 dolara na sat. Mora postojati ograničenje onoga što čini govor kako bi se spriječila kopilanizacija termina i pretjerano liberalno tumačenje Prvog amandmana.<br/><br/>- Korporacija već ima moć da izda izjavu u korist kandidata ili politike kroz svoje političke akcijske odbore, a pojedini članovi biznisa su dobrodošli da daju i novac. - Međutim, dopuštajući korporaciji da iskoristi svoju ogromnu zaradu kako bi izravno financirala izbore ili da ukloni kandidata kompromitira demokratski pojam slobodnih i poštenih izbora. - Postoje neprimjerene veze čak i sada između političara i raznih industrija, ali ova nova presuda bi učinila takve veze robusnijim i dala im furnir legitimnosti. ? Politicar finansiran od strane biznisa bi postao potpuno vezan za svoj politicki program, a ne za birace.<br/><br/>Ne radi se samo o neovisnosti političara, već i o neovisnosti naših sudaca, za koje se najmanje očekuje da budu nepristrani. - Mnoge države još uvijek koriste izbore za imenovanje sudaca, što ih ostavlja ranjivima na utjecaj političke potrošnje. U nedavnom govoru na konferenciji za pravni fakultet, bivša sutkinja Vrhovnog suda Sandra Day O'Connor zabrinuta je zbog utjecaja sredstava korporativne kampanje na pravosudne izbore, rekavši da je sudska kampanja donijela prošlotjednom odlukom u Građanima Ujedinjenih naroda sve veći problem za održavanje neovisnog pravosuđa.<br/><br/>Dva temelja naše demokracije, slobodni izbori i nezavisno pravosuđe, ugroženi su aktivistom Vrhovnog suda i odlukom o miješanju. Slučaj je mogao biti mnogo uži u korist Ujedinjenih građana, ali umjesto toga, većina sudaca odlučila je proširiti slučaj kako bi se zajamčila prava velikog novca zbog interesa američkog naroda. - Senatori Dick Durbin (D-IL) i Arlen Specter (D-PA) predstavili Zakon o poštenim izborima u ožujku prošle godine. Zabranjivalo bi doprinose odbora za političke akcije i odgovaralo bi pojedinačnim donacijama, ograničenim na 100 dolara, na 4:1 osnovi tako da se prikupljanje sredstava fokusira na ljude. Takav sustav je uspostavljen u New Yorku od Zakona o financiranju kampanje 1988. godine, a ostatak zemlje je odavno trebao uslijediti, ali nikada prije nije bila potrebnija borba za javno financiranje.<br/><br/>Autorica je Columbia College juniorskog magistra u političkim znanostima.<br/><br/>14. amandman, koji je bio jedan od dopuna za obnovu dodanih nakon Rata za Sjevernu agresiju nikada nije zakonski ratificiran od strane SAD-a i izazvao je više problema od svih drugih poslijeratnih izmjena zajedno. - Ako mi dobro služi pamćenje, korporacije su proglašene od strane Vrhovnog suda za 14. državljane Amedmenta tokom kasnih 1800-ih ili ranih 1900-ih. U slučaju da niste upoznati sa formulacijom ovog amandmana, to je u osnovi učinilo svakoga građaninom (i subjektom) Sjedinjenih Američkih Država. Prije rata, svi pojedinci bili su državljani države unutar koje su boravili i nitko nije bio državljanin SAD-a niti su bili predmet jurisdikcije SAD-a osim onih koji su boravili u okrugu Columbia ili su boravili unutar jedne od teritorija pod jurisdikcijom SAD-a. Glavna svrha Rata za Sjevernu agresiju bila je uništavanje soverenosti pojedinih država i smanjenje statusa svakog Amerikanca na ono subjekta pod kontrolom i jurisdikcijom vlade Sjedinjenih Država. Očevi osnivači su osnovali našu vladu kao labavu konfederaciju suverenih država sa državama koje koriste svu značajnu poljsku moć. Stvari će se samo pogoršati dok mi narod ne izbacimo Teive i mjenjače novca iz Washingtona i vratimo našu vladu u ono što je nekad bila.<br/><br/>Nije da korporacije nisu ljudi, nego ljudi nisu korporacije, prevareni smo da prihvatimo korporacijski identitet [ALL CAPS]. Kad god odemo na sud, idemo kao korporacija, a ne kao fizička osoba, prve korporacije su bile vlade, a logično gledano, ograničena odgovornost za korporaciju je produženje suverenog imuniteta na kralja nakon što više nije bio kralj. Iste vladajuće elitne obitelji još uvijek imaju kontrolu i to seže sve do prvih poznatih o vanzemaljcima[anunaki] o kojima govore sumerski dokumenti. - Ista grupa također preuzima zasluge ili krivnju za sve religije i tajna društva.<br/><br/>Kakve to veze ima? \"Razmislite o tome, cijeli Kongres i Senat su pas i poni show, pravi brokeri moći koji sve to kontroliraju su u sjeni, rade poslove, rade ono što žele, sa AL-CIA-DA i MOSSAD ubijaju sve koji se ne slažu sa ovim senkama vladinih šupaka koji to zaista vode.<br/><br/>Zašto je sada toliko važno biti toliko uznemiren zbog ovog sranja? Nakon više od dvjesto godina apsolutnog dokaza da su političari samo otmjena lutkarska predstava kako bi nas odvratili od stvarnog cviljenja i dilovanja u stražnjim sobama drugdje, zašto je bitno sada kada je ukupno preziranje demokracije iskazano od strane SCOTUS-a u ovoj presudi? - Šupci na ovom sudu znaju da pravi momci sa rukama na polugama moći sistema nisu u Kongresu i Senatu.<br/><br/>- Kada je vladavina zakona postala opsoletna u svijetu, općenito, i sve je postalo manje ili više Rollerball samo ovaj put, na steroide, za i po korporacijama, zašto je ova jedina presuda učinila sve toliku razliku? Zašto svi vi seronje mislite da ovaj 'lagging' indikator kraja bilo kakvih privida demokratske vlade čini bilo kakvu razliku.<br/><br/>Da li neko od vas misli da korporacije i bogati uticaji u senkama ne bi nastavili da vrše bilo kakvu i svu svoju volju na nas ostale?<br/><br/>Za one od vas koji misle da je bilo drugačije, predlažem vam da nađete lijek za svoj UKUPNI NAVIVETE!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>- ova presuda nije napravila jednu jotu razlike. Uvek je bilo ovako, mnogo pre nego što je SCOTUS u osnovi rekao korporacijama; - samo napred, radi šta hoćeš... mali ljudi su samo topovsko meso za tvoje ratove, chattel za tebe da trampiš i prodaješ u slobodno vreme.<br/><br/>Demokracija je uvijek bila iluzija. - stvaranje takve planine od ovog krtičnjaka je apsolutno neopravdano, u svjetlu činjenice da cijela 230 godina povijesti ove republike, debele mačke i bogati oligarsi nikada nisu trebali bilo koji Kongres ili Senat da rade ono što žele, ni pod kojim okolnostima, nikada. - Upravo su to uradili.<br/><br/>Vlada koju ste gledali bila je himera, a ne stvarna..<br/><br/>- što prije svi dođete do te spoznaje, prije ćemo moći nastaviti s manje pišanja i jadikovanja zbog puke šale o formalnosti koja je uvijek bila slučaj od prvog dana, i nije bila podmetnuta na nas od strane SCOTUS-a, sud nam je samo prilično zakašnjelo izjavio što se događalo dugo, dugo vremena.<br/><br/>Exxon je malo stidljiv, pa ne očekujte javne najave, mislimo na tiho vjenčanje u Renou.<br/><br/>- Svaki posao je samo grupa pojedinaca (malih ili velikih) koji kolektivno ostvaruju svoja individualna prava. Stoga svaki posao ima ista prava kao i oni pojedinci (osim, naravno, prava glasa, koje je rezervirano samim pojedincima). Sloboda raspolaganja nečijim bogatstvom kao što se vidi prikladnim dolazi zajedno sa slobodom da ga zaslužite. - Ako je skup pojedinaca zaradio novac, trebao bi slobodno odlučiti kako se odlagati taj novac. Stvarni problem nije u tome što poduzeća mogu donirati kampanje, već da je vladi dozvoljeno miješati se u posao - tj. da vlada može dati neku uslugu u zamjenu za taj novac. Potrebno nam je razdvajanje trgovine i države na isti način i iz istih razloga kao što imamo razdvajanje crkve i države. Također mi je zanimljivo da je autor izabrao kao primjere dva zakona (zonska i minimalna plaća) koji također krše individualna prava. - Prvi krši imovinska prava, a drugi krši prava pojedinaca da se slobodno ugovore.<br/><br/>pod tvojom analizom, niko ne bi smeo da se meša u bilo šta što neko radi. - recimo, da sam u gužvi, sa subotnjim večernjim specijalitetom, i da želim da ti 'slobodno govorim' dupe sa njim na isti način kao što je CIA oslobodila Bobija Kenedija u L.A.-u jedne noći, to je u redu, jer ometanje mene je ometanje mog prava na slobodu govora.<br/><br/>- to je kritična mana kod vas liberalnih šupaka....mislite da ne postoji društvena uloga za bilo koju vladavinu zakona, da sve što se uklapa pod 'krajeve opravdanja znači' racionalne stvari ne bi trebalo nikada biti ometan, samo neka svatko radi što god želi, i sve to funkcionira. To Ayn Rand sranje ne radi, čovječe! Radi do točke gdje netko drugi plaća cijenu za tvoju 'što god želim učiniti' slobodu prelazi granicu i onda se miješa u moju slobodu.<br/><br/>Pravila i zakoni bi trebalo da postoje u okviru društva strogo da bi se držalo pod kontrolom tog dobrog starog, mogu da radim šta god poželim, a to je samo da sam ja slobodan, red konjskih govana.<br/><br/>- Korporacije nemaju nikakva prava, glupane! - globalno, oni su bili razlog zbog kojeg postoji toliko propalih država, opljačkanih voljom korporatokrata sa sjedištem u SAD-u koji misle da se sloboda njihovog govora prevodi u; -učinite ono što vam kažemo ili ćemo vas bombardirati da biste dobili vaše resurse koji su nam potrebni - vrsta silovanja i pljačkanja.<br/><br/>- jednog dana, nadam se da će te neki šupak jebati sa svojim 'slobodnim govorom' i onda ćemo čuti kako kukaš kako te zakon iznevjerio. U tvom libertarijanskom svijetu 'mogu raditi što želim', jedina vladavina prava je ona koju nadoknadiš da opravdaš svoj krajnji cilj. Za vas će onda biti zabavno vidjeti kako se nosite s tuđom interpretacijom vaše granice kao samo malo neugodnosti za njegove ciljeve, što nije nužno poštivalo vaše granice, sigurno!<br/><br/>Neko po imenu -uh ha, zar ne. - Možda ima logičnu tačku skrivenu u šumi nazivanja i zloupotrebe slame, ali šta kažeš na ovo: Korporacije su izumi države koji su stvoreni da prenesu neke od rizika poslovanja od ljudi koji vode posao dioničarima (ako ih ima), kupcima (ako ih ima) i javnosti. Dakle, ako korporacija počini prevaru, korporacija je ta koja je kažnjena (obično) i kažnjena, a ljudi koji vode korporaciju mogu da odu zlatnim rukovanjem. Troškovi novčane kazne prenose se kupcima i plaćaju vladi (a ne žrtvama!).<br/><br/>Mislim da je poenta, da ako korporacija počini finansijski zločin, a niko ne primeti (ako drvo padne u šumu i niko ga ne čuje, da li je to zaista izazvalo buku) da li se onda dogodio zločin?<br/><br/>- i u veitch dijagramu, gdje se dvije mrvice sudaraju i interaguju, ako jedna zabije u drugu granicu, tko je arbitraža tko je narušen?<br/><br/>- moja poanta je ovo: ne postoje argumenti od slame u vezi Davidove asini procene da korporacije mogu da rade šta god žele sa napuštanjem. Istina je, davanje korporacija, i oligarha, ili bilo koga, dozvola da rade ono što žele, kad god žele, pod pretpostavkom da su oni Individualci i stoga, zagarantovani slobodni govornici, je i apsurdno i konjsko sranje.<br/><br/>Korporacije su sastavljene od grupa ljudi, ljudi koji bi trebali živjeti po nekom prividu vladavine zakona, a kada ne moraju, onda mogu raditi sve što želim sve dok me nitko ne uhvati ili me smatra odgovornim za moje prijestupe, koji se ovdje događaju.<br/><br/>- ako je to svijet u kojem David želi živjeti, pusti ga da ode tamo i ostvari to, ali dovraga, ne očekuj da se ne protivim tom sranju!<br/><br/>Svi se možemo slagati, sve dok granice ne naruše po volji bilo tko tko misli da svoje pravo da rade ono što žele zapravo poništava moje pravo da se ne miješaju u njihove postupke.<br/><br/>Ako ne mogu funkcionirati u zajednici kao dobronamjerni i stoga, neometani entitet, onda nemaju pravo postojati.<br/><br/>On je seronja što tvrdi da radi ono što želiš, to je sloboda govora, to je gomila konjskog sranja, to je la zemlja sranje, i ja se protivim bilo kome ili bilo čemu što krši moje granice sa tom slobodnom govornom tvrdnjom. - To je gomila govana i znaš da jeste!<br/><br/>Nisam rekao da ljudi imaju pravo kršiti tuđa prava. Da, zakoni bi trebali postojati, ali samo da bi zaštitili prava ljudi.<br/><br/>Izvinjavam se što sam pišao u tvoje kukuruzne pahuljice. Mislim da ste zaključili da korporacije mogu raditi što god žele pod ovim pravom slobode govora, što je danas u Amerk'a-i šala jer je PATRIOT-ov akt i neprijavljeno stanje MARTIAL LAW-a pod kojim živimo od rujna 2001. dao vladi mogućnost obustave i 'ukidanja' Ustava SAD-a i Zakona o pravima.<br/><br/>Na žalost, ljudi imaju samo nekoliko prava. Imamo pravo da budemo oporezovani do taèke apsurda. Imamo pravo da budemo regrutovani i postanemo topovsko meso za ratove oligarha. Mislim da se u tome možemo složiti!<br/><br/>Još uvijek se pitam kako je novajlija Roberts naslijedio Vrhovno pravosuđe nakon Rhenquista, a ne ta uloga nekome tko ima više iskustva na klupi. Dati im pravo glasa na izborima kao pravi ljudi?; možda imati glasove od strane ljudskih bića koja se računaju kao 3/5 osobe ili manje od njihove 1?<br/><br/>Nisam pročitala sve knjige dužine 183 stranice, ali smatram da su te užasne izjave u njima ne samo kontradiktorne njihovim ekspanzivnim postupcima u ovom slučaju, već i abdikaciji njihove dužnosti:<br/><br/>Blodgett protiv Holdena, 275 U.

Zato što su ulozi tako visoki, naša standardna praksa je da se suzdržimo od rješavanja ustavnih pitanja osim kada je potrebno presuditi o posebnim tvrdnjama pred nama. Vidjeti Ashwander protiv TVA, 297 U. S. 288, 346-348 (1936) (Brandeis, J., congress-ring). Ova politika podvlači i našu spremnost da utvrdimo dvosmislene statute kako bismo izbjegli ustavne probleme i našu praksu - 'nikada ne formulirati vladavinu ustavnog prava šire nego što se zahtijeva preciznim činjenicama na koje će se primijeniti.' - Sjedinjene Države protiv Raines, 362<br/>U.

Cf. 2 U. S. C. Š. §441e (zabrana doprinosa i rashoda koji se primjenjuju na stranog državljanina [s] . Sekcija 441b nije ograničena na korporacije ili udruženja koja su nastala u stranim zemljama ili financirana pretežno od strane stranih dioničara. Sekcija 441b stoga bi bila prevelika čak i da pretpostavimo, tvrdimo, da vlada ima uvjerljiv interes da ograniči strani utjecaj na naš politički proces.<br/>U.

Sve vladine agencije su navedene na DUNN-u i BRADSTREET-u, zajedničkom pravu koje se ustav odnosi na prirodne ljude, a sve današnje poslovanje sudova je korporativno značenje da nas smatraju pojedinačnim korporacijama. Ne zaboravite 14. amandman, prije toga nije bilo američkih državljana, većina nas je nesvjesno tražila američko korporativno državljanstvo, moramo se pozabaviti pravilom bankarske elite. - Gotovo svi vodeći REPS i DEMS su članovi VIJEĆA STRANIH VEZA ili TLC-a. LOok up povijest tko je započeo i kontrolira ove. Rush, Glenn i Sean su svi lažljivci i bankari bootlickers. Obama je lutka za CFR. 911 istina ima mnogo više utjecaja i služila bi ujedinjenju poštenih ljudi u ovoj zemlji.<br/><br/>Ne vjerujem da sam korporacija ili građanin jedne ali, ako gubbermint tako misli, da li presuda SCOTUS-a znači da nema više ograničenja doprinosa za kampanju za bilo koga, tvrtke ili pojedince? Radije bih da se novac ukloni iz našeg izbornog procesa u potpunosti — jednako vrijeme na američkim zračnim valovima bez naknade za sve kandidate |
| And so the TWEWY Spriting Thread army set off, their destination being Japan. Unfortunately, no airline whatsoever would let them on board because of their rather large amassment of weapons of moderate destruction. And pitchtorches, which constituted both a fire and a stabbing hazard. And so, they just went home and downloaded the movie Kanon wanted to watch illegally. They gave it 7/10 stars on rotten tomatoes. The End.<br/><br/>Spoiler:The bottom right Sprite is the new one.<br/><br/>Highlight this box with your cursor to read the spoiler text.

Besides, no one else took the easy, predictable route, so somebody had to. Peace out.<br/><br/>The first sprite was half made by me. The second row contains a teaser for the continuation of the clown sprites i made a while back. And the third row is just a few old sprites that i decided to fix up and redo some parts.<br/><br/>So I just joined, and tried to make a sprite, it turned out ok, but it seemed like a lot of work, and I only made a few changes to neku. How do you make the complicated ones?<br/><br/>Spoiler:<br/><br/>Highlight this box with your cursor to read the spoiler text.<br/><br/>Spoiler:<br/><br/>How to get better at spriting:<br/><br/>1. To start off, master the art of recoloring sprites and shading. 2. Next start copying and pasting body parts to other sprites. E.x Take the arm band off of neku and put it on joshua. 3. Start small by switching around body parts and re-coloring them. (in other words, just experiment and see which combo you like) 4. Then start to challenging yourself to make more complex sprites. Instead of copying and pasting and recoloring, you can try and draw clothes or faces. 5. PRACTICE PRACTICE AND MORE PRACTICE. Keep practicing and experimenting and never give upPeace out.<br/><br/>Sometimes people need to be reminded not to give up so easily and continue to persist. | I tako je TWEWY Spriting Thread vojska krenula, njihovo odredište je Japan.

Sljedeći početak kopiranja i lijepljenja dijelova tijela u druge sprite. E.x Skinite traku za ruku s nekua i stavite je na Joshuuu. 3. Započnite malo prebacivanjem dijelova tijela i ponovno ih obojite. - (drugim riječima, samo eksperimentirajte i vidite koja kombinacija vam se sviđa) 4. Tada počnite izazivati sebe da napravite složenije sprite. umjesto kopiranja i lijepljenja i prebojavanja, možete pokušati nacrtati odjeću ili lica. 5. PRAKTIČKA PRAKTIKA I VIŠE PRAKTIKA. - Nastavi da vežbaš i eksperimentišeš i nikad ne odustaješ od mira.<br/><br/>Ponekad ljude treba podsjetiti da ne odustaju tako lako i nastave ustrajati. |
| Interpretive Summary: This book chapter reviews various aspects of what is needed for the selection of model weeds to answer questions pertinent to weed science. Specifically, the chapter covers why we need model species, attributes of model species, and provides the current state of knowledge and resources that have been developed for a few key weeds such as leafy spurge, Canada thistle, waterhemp, and purple false brome that may make them good potential models.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract:<br/>Selection of a limited number of model weeds and development of genomic-based tools and resources will facilitate studies on the ecology, biology, physiology and development of weedy species. Such studies will help answer fundamental questions of concern to weed scientists. However, to ensure the weed science community can appropriately and fully utilize these model weeds, they will need to be carefully selected. Various attributes such as ease of study, weedy characteristics, and importance as a weedy species will need to be considered. Additionally, the availability of existing genomic resources can be used to extend the list of viable model weeds. Several resources have also been developed specifically for weeds such as leafy spurge, Canada thistle, waterhemp, and purple false brome. | - Interpretive Summary: U ovom poglavlju knjige razmatraju se različiti aspekti onoga što je potrebno za odabir modela korova kako bi se odgovorilo na pitanja relevantna za nauku o korovu. - Konkretno, poglavlje pokriva zašto su nam potrebne modelske vrste, atributi modelnih vrsta, i pruža trenutno stanje znanja i resursa koji su razvijeni za nekoliko ključnih korova kao što su lisnati spužva, kanadski čičak, vodozemac i ljubičasti lažni brom koji ih mogu učiniti dobrim potencijalnim modelima.<br/><br/>Tehnički sažetak:<br/>- Izbor ograničenog broja modela korova i razvoj genomskih alata i resursa olakšat će studije o ekologiji, biologiji, fiziologiji i razvoju korovastih vrsta. Te studije će pomoći u odgovoru na temeljna pitanja koja se tiču korovskih znanstvenika. Međutim, kako bi se osiguralo da korovska znanstvena zajednica može prikladno i u potpunosti iskoristiti ove modele korova, oni će morati biti pažljivo odabrani. Potrebno je razmotriti različite atribute kao što su lakoća proučavanja, korovaste karakteristike i važnost kao korovaste vrste. Osim toga, dostupnost postojećih genomskih resursa može se koristiti za proširenje popisa održivih modela korova. - Razvijeno je i nekoliko resursa posebno za korov kao što su lisnati spužva, kanadski čičak, vodozemac i ljubičasti lažni brom. |
