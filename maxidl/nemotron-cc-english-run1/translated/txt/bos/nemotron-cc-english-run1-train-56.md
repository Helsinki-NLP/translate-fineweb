| While acknowledging that it's impossible to argue someone into loving something they hate, and vice versa, it's still often enjoyable to attempt the argument. When we talk to people whose opinions directly contradict ours, we're forced to defend our tastes, define our opinions, and analyze why we react the way we do. Which is why we have Why Don't You Like This?, in which two of our staffers will attempt to discover whether people with opposing opinions can get beyond "No, you're wrong!" and have a civil, constructive, and possibly even convincing discussion about their points of contention. Because no matter what talk radio says, there's still a middle ground between "We agree utterly" and "I'm right, and you're stupid and evil."<br/><br/>Scott: Since discussing my Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World apostasy, we've been looking for a case where I can call you out for not liking something wonderful, and we didn't have to look for long. We were sitting right next to each other during Martin Scorsese's Hugo—me, utterly enchanted by its fantastical tribute to the wonders of early silent cinema, and you, apparently resisting it at every turn. Critical consensus has been on my side: It hit the No. 9 spot on our collective Top 15 (though you listed it as your Overrated choice), has won (or placed) in various film-critic awards, and currently enjoys an 83 score on Metacritic. That doesn't mean you're wrong, of course, but the onus is on you to explain why Hugo was, in your words, "hollow and artificial," where many of us saw it as a lovely evocation of Scorsese's childhood and the medium when it was still in its infancy. And please be gentle as you rip this butterfly apart by the wings.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Tasha: I can't be gentle, Scott. Sometimes it hurts less if you rip the Band-Aid off all at once. (And even if it doesn't, who wants to walk around wearing a half-ripped-off Band-Aid? Gross.) The fact is, I found Hugo to be a wearyingly manipulative exercise in fakery, starting from its opening glide through a Paris train station, which reminded me more than anything of Robert Zemeckis' The Polar Express. Unlike Mike D'Angelo, I'm a fan of long, unbroken takes as a way of establishing a space and encouraging viewers to unconsciously hold their breaths as a camera explores an area; but when the space being explored is a slick, shiny CGI creation, and the camera floats weightlessly through it with no physical sense that either the camera or the surroundings are really there, that exploration starts to feel like watching someone else play a videogame. And the rest of the film felt similarly poreless and unreal to me, both in terms of its setting and in terms of its highly contrived, maudlin story.<br/><br/>I don't necessarily have a problem with manufactured, stylized environments in film. I loved Baz Luhrmann's equally sprawling, utterly artificial take on Paris in Moulin Rouge, for instance, but that film has a sense of its own ridiculousness, a sense of humor about how deliberately over-the-top it is. Ditto the stylization of Jean-Pierre Jeunet, particularly in Amélie. (Both Jeunet and Luhrmann felt like strong visual influences here.) I got the sense, however, that Martin Scorsese wanted me to take Hugo entirely seriously. Even though it's yet another achingly sentimental story about a plucky orphan bringing color back into the life of a grumpy old curmudgeon. And I just couldn't.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>There is nothing I enjoy more in film than being surprised. And there's nothing I resent and resist more than being overtly manipulated, being loudly told what to feel and when to feel it. A good film does this kind of thing subtly; a bad one uses crashing music cues and sweet strings—and in this case, a grubby, huge-eyed, disheveled orphan staring woefully at the camera—to demand pathos, and to tell viewers they're horrible people if they don't serve it up on demand. That said, I can deal with sad kids and grumpy adults making life better for each other—I really dug this year's Le Havre, which was essentially the same plot without all the cutesiness—but I find the artificial environments reflect badly on the artificial emotions, and each makes the other seem more fake by turns.<br/><br/>Let's start with that. In our overlooked films video, you and Noel both took Keith to task for championing Tyrannosaur, because you felt it wasn't realistic enough—too contrived, too miserablist, too much, too far. How is it possible that you can't buy a stymied old crank who breaks things when he's angry, but you can buy an orphan living inside a giant train-station clock and embarking upon a whimsical journey to repair a mysterious automaton that he believes might bear secrets from his dead father, but which instead leads him on a quirky voyage of self-discovery, into the magical land of cinema? Did you never find Hugo's gaudy rococo design, aggressive heartstring-plucking, or wheelbarrow-loads of quirk even a little excessive or hard to swallow?<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Scott: Jeunet and Luhrmann as influences on Scorsese?! Forget being indelicate, now you're deliberately poking me with a sharp stick. If you're looking for inspirations for Hugo—indeed, if you're looking for the emotional core of Hugo—you have to go back to Scorsese's childhood on Elizabeth Street in Little Italy, where an asthmatic little boy, unable to play outside with the other kids, retreated to Alexander Korda fantasies like The Thief Of Bagdad. Or, more simply, just go straight to the source himself: George Méliès, whose A Trip To The Moon remains the Big Bang of all cinematic fantasies, that moment when the camera was not used to document the world as it is, but whatever whimsical, magical, transporting place a filmmaker wants to invent for it. And that tradition has been developed and expanded upon for decades before the likes of Jeunet and Luhrmann got their grubby little paws on it.<br/><br/>And speaking of Jeunet, nice attempt to take away my rhetorical weapon, but I'll say it anyway: How can you love Amélie, yet find Hugo synthetic and "excessive" and "wearyingly manipulative"? You say that Amélie and Moulin Rouge have redeeming "sense of [their] own ridiculousness" where Scorsese means us to take Hugo seriously, and I don't think that's the case, at least on the latter point. That Scorsese feels evident passion about the movies is, I suppose, why you'd interpret Hugo as self-serious. But to me, it's those feelings that give the film an emotional ballast that the Luhrmann and Jeunet films don't have. All three films make aggressive use of the marvels of CGI—and Scorsese adds 3D to the mix, to wonderful effect—but where you and I differ is on the issue of weightlessness. I agree that CGI has a distancing effect; worlds composed entirely of digital plasticine are flexible to the point where they sometimes have no presence. You referred to Hugo in your "Overrated" entry for our Best Of Film piece as "a CGI gimcrack"—a perfect dis… for another movie.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>It's fair to say that Scorsese has built Hugo around a standard-issue, "heartstring-plucking" children's book/movie plot: Orphan misses his daddy, creates his own little fantasy world, gloms onto a new friend, convinces a crusty old fuddy-duddy to soften up and maybe adopt him. But that's just the narrative skeleton, and Scorsese provides plenty of flesh and blood. For one, you can't watch Hugo, the lonely boy, peering out from clock towers to the hustle-and-bustle of a Paris train station without thinking of Scorsese, another lonely boy, staring out of his bedroom window on Elizabeth Street. And even if you're not a big enough film nerd to make that connection, I really feel like Hugo's journey is not in finding a new father figure, but in persisting with the mechanical magic that stands as his own father's legacy. That's what film is: The persistence of vision that allows us to accept an illusory version of the world at 24 frames per second is science and magic at once. Hugo's relationship with Méliès isn't about him cozying up to a new daddy, but sharing a common enthusiasm the old man has submerged in bitterness. To me, that's a far more unique angle on a potentially shopworn premise.<br/><br/>Did you really find none of Hugo enchanting? Even the film's few detractors seem willing to admit that the sequences evoking cinema history and Méliès' studio—with Michael Stuhlbarg as the heroic film scholar!—were terrific. It felt, in the best possible way, like a heady compression of my History Of Film 101 class in college, condensing a semester's worth of clips and context into something between a montage and an animated pop-up book. And it speaks to the ingenious design of the film, which layers fact and fantasy so beautifully that it's at once a history of Méliès and the birth of cinema, and just the sort of simple, sumptuously produced cinematic wonder that Scorsese himself would have loved as a child. Thank goodness Hugo doesn't follow the Jeunet/Luhrmann model and have "a sense of its own ridiculousness." As a fantasy connoisseur yourself, wouldn't you say there's value in playing it straight and earnest and unabashed rather than winking at the audience? You may find Hugo sickly sweet, but I don't think the authenticity of its sentiment is to be denied.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Tasha: Yes, I did in fact find parts of Hugo enchanting. (Notice how I'm answering your question up front, whereas you were too busy frothing with apoplexy to address mine, though I assume that's an answer in its own right. Okay, "influence" may be overstating the case—I just meant the visual style looked very familiar. Though as Keith pointed out when you brought this up in person, Scorsese is neither opposed to drawing inspiration from other people's visuals, nor immune to it.) Primarily, I was enchanted by the parts dealing with Georges Méliès' backstory, with his love of cinema, with the work he put into his art and the joy he got out of it. There's an awful lot of beauty and fun in the staging of the underwater-court scene from Méliès' "Fairyland," and in the sequence at the end, focusing on Méliès footage. I'll grant you that Hugo's connection with Méliès over a shared love of film is a nice touch. And I do enjoy a good film about filmmaking.<br/><br/>But Hugo isn't primarily about film, in spite of the Méliès tie-ins. In addition to the themes you cite, it's also about finding your purpose, as the characters expressly, laboriously explain to each other and to us. And it's about spectacle, and big action setpieces, and chases, and happily-ever-after endings where even the angry bully and the shy older couple and fergawdsakes even the cranky dachshund all get paired off with charming love interests by the end. It's about the super-precocious Hermione Granger-type being bossy and perky and clever and praising the magical worlds encased in books. And all of this business is mighty familiar, and mighty artificial.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Yes, Scorsese is playing with archetypes. Problem is, I never felt he imbued them with anything new, fresh, or believable, in spite of his own backstory. I would have much preferred a story about a young Scorsese growing up with asthma—something small-scale and real, without vast rooms full of CGI clockwork and golden glowing dust-motes and prophetic dreams and a raging adult tyrant-guard with a heart of gold—all of that outsized, over-the-top nonsense. You keep citing Scorsese's personal background and love of film as evidence that he's really feeling what he's putting on the screen, but I don't feel his personal touch in any of this, except the moments that are expressly about film. The core emotions may be real, but that doesn't make the execution less false.<br/><br/>You say the authenticity of the emotion isn't to be denied. I don't question whether Scorsese personally felt lonely and isolated as a child, but I don't feel loneliness and isolation on the screen—I see a bunch of exaggerated signifiers (Hugo is filthy and his clothes are worn and all the adults yell at him and he regularly gets chased by a scary dog!) and big beats, with shouting and weeping and Spielbergian wonder-emoting. For me, sincerity is more convincing and more personal when it's quiet and direct; when someone's shouting his opinions at me, I assume he's either really angry, or just trying to overwhelm my senses to keep me from expressing my own opinion. Hugo was one long shout, as far as I was concerned.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Why didn't I get that sense of fakery from Amélie, you ask? Actually, I did. I'll completely acknowledge that Amélie and Moulin Rouge are both big, manipulative, artificial constructions in the exact same vein, demanding specific emotions at specific intervals, and trying to sell those emotions with heavy emoting and aggressive soundtrack prodding. Neither of them really sold me on their emotions as authentic human feeling. What I enjoyed in those two films was the construction—particularly Amélie's heady, laughable lists of random characterizing features and experiences for its cast, and Moulin Rouge's musical-magpie mashups and recontextualizations. I'm often sold on stories that do creative or ambitious things with structure, and both of those movies qualify, where Hugo is a much more linear, standard kid-quest.<br/><br/>But in the end, for me, it really does come down to a feeling that those movies are goofs, whereas Hugo is meant to be taken seriously at every treacly moment. You don't think that's true—but you're simultaneously defending its integrity in terms of its absolutely authentic, rooted-in-Scorsese's-history emotion, and telling me I'm wrong, and he doesn't mean it to be taken seriously. How do you reconcile those two statements? What about the film suggests to you that it isn't meant to be taken at face value? And is it possible this is just another Curious Case Of Benjamin Button-like situation where I find the use of kids in big-budget films to be largely sappy and melodramatic, whereas you as a dad find it bypasses your cynicism and goes straight to your family-feeling?<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Scott: Not sure I meant that Scorsese doesn't mean to be taken seriously; it's just that he's chosen a whimsical vehicle through which to express a serious love of the movies. When you say, "But Hugo isn't primarily about film, in spite of the Méliès tie-ins," I'm mystified. I grant that you find many elements of Hugo overly familiar and laborious and full of Spielbergian wonder-emoting—there's nothing I can do to argue around that perception, which other Hugo doubters share. Sometimes a film means to charm and enchant, and it doesn't for some; you've got Hugo and I've got Amélie, though I think the latter, deliberately artificial as it is, means for us to find it romantic. (Rather than, say, some horrible mechanical contraption fit for a Saw sequel.)<br/><br/>But to say Hugo isn't primarily about film? If it's not about film, then it's the most pointlessly discursive story about [whatever you think it's about] I've ever seen. The relationship between Hugo and Méliès is the heart of the movie, and at the heart of that is not just some stock connection between Plucky Orphan and Crusty Old Guy With A Heart Of Gold, but a shared affinity for engineered magic—specifically the magic of the movies. I think Scorsese and his collaborators have found a way to express their enthusiasm over the early days of cinema through a fantasy that's accessible to all ages. The archetype-filled children's tale is the merely the crust here; cinema is the pie. (Mmmm… pie.)<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>As for The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button, I don't see much of a connection, other than trying to expose me as a Benjamin Button defender as a way of damaging my credibility. (Incidentally, how are the extras on that G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra Blu-ray?) I've said to you that the sleep-deprived new dad in me was perhaps vulnerable to Benjamin Button, but I can't imagine a time when the premise of aging in reverse wouldn't move me. (Cradling the love of your life in your arms as an infant? How can you not be affected by that?) And besides, I don't see how Benjamin Button relates much to Hugo as a film concerning kids, since that's just a small segment of a story that spans a much larger trajectory.<br/><br/>So have I convinced you? Likely not. But I'm happy to learn that Hugo wasn't entirely devoid of enchantments for you. The sequences on Méliès the filmmaker are what put Hugo over for me—and in that, at least, we can share some movie love.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Tasha: Nope, I can't say you've convinced me, any more than I've convinced you. It's impossible to argue anyone into a visceral love of anything, and it really should be equally impossible to talk someone down from visceral love. Mostly, you've let me see Hugo in Scott-O-Vision, which is an interesting experience; at least now I'm mildly convinced that we didn't somehow manage to see entirely different films which both somehow had the same name and director.<br/><br/>We certainly had different experiences, though, and to my mind, focused on different aspects of the production: I still don't see the "film is marvelous" theme as the movie's single strand, so much as one among too many. "Pointlessly discursive" almost covers it, though I'd throw in "often needlessly cutesy and precious" on top of that. While you're focused on the film's tasty pie filling, I feel like that pie was covered with a pound of crystallized sugar, and I think that does make a difference, regardless of the film's core message or handful of terrific scenes. See also Benjamin Button, which I did not bring up just to chafe you—I really do think you have more of a sentimental streak than I do regarding children in cinema, especially when they're used more as symbols of vulnerability and innocence than as human characters. Hey, you know what film totally does not have cute wide-eyed moppets bringing hope to a cynical world? G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra. Maybe I will go watch those Blu-ray extras. I could use some explosion-insulin to compensate for Hugo's sweetness. | Iako priznajete da je nemoguće tvrditi nekoga da voli nešto što mrzi, i obrnuto, još uvijek je često ugodno pokušati raspravu. Kada razgovaramo sa ljudima čija mišljenja direktno proturječe našima, prisiljeni smo braniti svoje ukuse, definirati svoja mišljenja i analizirati zašto reagiramo na način na koji reagiramo. Zašto ti se ovo ne sviđa?, u kojem će dvojica naših djelatnika pokušati otkriti mogu li ljudi sa suprotstavljenim mišljenjima preći preko toga. -Ne, griješiš. -I imati civilnu, konstruktivnu, a možda čak i uvjerljivu raspravu o svojim točkama spora. Jer bez obzira na to što radio govori, postoji još jedna sredina između... mi se potpuno slažemo... i... ja sam u pravu, a ti si glup i zao...<br/><br/>Otkako smo razgovarali o mom Scott Pilgrim vs. Svjetskom otpadništvu, tražimo slučaj u kojem vas mogu pozvati jer vam se ne sviđa nešto divno, i nismo dugo morali tražiti. Sjedili smo jedan do drugog za vrijeme Huga Martina Scorsesea, potpuno očarani njegovim fantastičnim počastima čudima ranog nijemog filma, a ti si mu se, očito, odupirao na svakom koraku. - Kritički konsenzus je bio na mojoj strani: Pogodio je mjesto br. 9 na našem kolektivnom top 15 (iako ste ga naveli kao svoj precijenjeni izbor), osvojio je (ili se plasirao) u razne filmsko-kritične nagrade, i trenutno uživa u 83 rezultatu na Metacriticu. To ne znači da griješite, naravno, ali na vama je da objasnite zašto je Hugo bio, po vašim riječima, surov i vještački, gdje smo ga mnogi od nas vidjeli kao divno evociranje Scorseseovog djetinjstva i medija dok je još bio u djetinjstvu. I molim te budi nježan dok razderaš ovog leptira za krila.<br/><br/>) Oglas<br/><br/>Ne mogu biti nježan, Scotte, ponekad manje boli ako odjednom pokidaš flaster. - Činjenica je, da sam otkrio da je Hugo dosadno manipulativna vježba u falsifikatima, počevši od njegovog otvaranja klizi kroz parišku željezničku stanicu, što me podsjetilo više od svega na Roberta Zemeckisa The Polar Express. Za razliku od Mikea D'Angela, ja sam obožavatelj dugog, neprekinutog uzima kao način uspostavljanja prostora i poticanja gledatelja da nesvjesno zadržavaju dah dok kamera istražuje područje; ali kada je prostor koji se istražuje skliska, sjajna CGI kreacija, a kamera bez obzira na to pluta bestežinski kroz njega bez fizičkog osjećaja da ili kamera ili okolica stvarno postoje, to istraživanje počinje osjećati kao da netko drugi igra videoigru. I ostatak filma osjećao se isto tako nerealno i nestvarno za mene, kako u smislu svog postavka tako i u smislu njegove visoko zamišljene, maudlin priče.<br/><br/>- Nemam nužno problem sa proizvedenim, stiliziranim okruženjem u filmu. Volio sam Baz Luhrmannovu jednako raširenu, krajnje umjetnu sliku Pariza u Moulin Rougeu, na primjer, ali taj film ima osjećaj za vlastitu smiješnost, smisao za humor o tome kako je namjerno pretjerao. - Isto kao stilizacija Jean-Pierre Jeunet, posebno u Amélie. (I Jeunet i Luhrmann osjećali su se kao snažni vizualni utjecaji ovdje.) Međutim, dobio sam osjećaj da Martin Scorsese želi da Hugo shvatim u potpunosti ozbiljno. Iako je to još jedna bolna sentimentalna priča o hrabrenom siročetu koje vraća boju u život mrzovoljnog starog mrzovoljnog mrzovolje.<br/><br/>) Oglas<br/><br/>Ne postoji ništa u čemu više uživam u filmu nego biti iznenađen, i ništa mi ne zamjera i ne odolijeva više od toga da budem izmanipulisan, da mi se glasno govori šta da osećam i kada da to osetim. Dobar film radi takve stvari suptilno; loš koristi udarne muzičke znakove i slatke žice - a u ovom slučaju, glomazno, ogromno-očno, razroko siroče koje jadno bulji u kameru - da zahtijeva patetiku, i da gledateljima kaže da su užasni ljudi ako ga ne posluže na zahtjev. To je rečeno, mogu se nositi sa tužnom djecom i mrzovoljnim odraslima koji čine život boljim jedno za drugo - stvarno sam iskopao ovogodišnji Le Havre, što je u suštini bio isti zaplet bez sve te slatkoće - ali nalazim da se umjetna sredina loše odražava na umjetne emocije, a jedna čini drugu lažnom po skretanju.<br/><br/>U našem previdjenom videu, ti i Noel ste odveli Keitha na zadatak da pobijedi Tyrannosaura, jer ste smatrali da nije dovoljno realističan, previše zamišljen, previše mizerablist, previše, previše, previše. Kako je moguće da ne možete kupiti starom šarlatanu koji lomi stvari kad je ljut, ali možete kupiti siroče koje živi unutar ogromnog sata na željezničkoj stanici i krenuti na hirovito putovanje kako bi popravio tajanstveni automat za koji vjeruje da bi mogao nositi tajne od mrtvog oca, ali koji ga umjesto toga vodi na čudno putovanje samootkrivanja, u magičnu zemlju kinematografije? Nikada niste našli Hugov gaudy rokoko dizajn, agresivan herctrring-clucking, ili kolica-opterećenja hirove čak i malo pretjerano ili teško progutati?<br/><br/>) Oglas<br/><br/>Jeunet i Luhrmann kao utjecaj na Scorsesea?! Zaboravite biti neodgojeni, sada me namjerno bockate oštrim štapom. Ako tražite inspiracije za Huga, ako tražite emocionalnu jezgru Huga, morate se vratiti Scorseseovom djetinjstvu u ulici Elizabeth u Maloj Italiji, gdje se mali astmatičar, koji se ne može igrati vani s ostalom djecom, povukao u fantazije Alexandera Korde poput Lopova iz Bagdada. Ili, jednostavnije, samo idite pravo do samog izvora: George Méliès, čiji je A Trip To the Moon i dalje Veliki prasak svih filmskih fantazija, taj trenutak kada kamera nije korištena da dokumentira svijet kakav jest, ali kakav god hirovit, magičan, transportirajući mjesto filmaš želi izmisliti za njega. I ta tradicija je razvijena i proširena desetljećima prije nego što su Jeunet i Luhrmann dobili svoje prljave šapice na nju.<br/><br/>Kad smo kod Jeuneta, lijep pokušaj da mi oduzmeš retoričko oružje, ali svejedno ću ti reći: kako možeš voljeti Amélie, a ipak pronaći Hugoa sintetičkog i pretjeranog i manipulativnog? Kažete da Amélie i Moulin Rouge imaju smisao za svoju glupost gdje Scorsese želi da Huga shvatimo ozbiljno, a ja mislim da to nije slučaj, barem u potonjem smislu. Scorsese osjeća očitu strast prema filmovima je, pretpostavljam, razlog zašto bi tumačio Huga kao samoozbiljnog, ali za mene, ti osjećaji daju filmu emocionalni balast koji Luhrmann i Jeunet filmovi nemaju. Sva tri filma agresivno koriste čuda CGI-a i Scorsese dodaje 3D u mješavinu, do divnog efekta - ali gdje se ti i ja razlikujemo je pitanje bestežinskog stanja. - Slažem se da CGI ima distanciran učinak; svjetovi sastavljeni u potpunosti od digitalne plasticine fleksibilni su do točke u kojoj ponekad nemaju prisutnosti. U svom \"precenjenom\" unosu za naš najbolji filmski komad nazvao si \"CGI gimcrack\" savršeni dis... za drugi film.<br/><br/>) Oglas<br/><br/>Pošteno je reći da je Scorsese sagradio Hugoa oko standardnog izdanja, struna za srce - dječja knjiga/filmska zapleta: Siroče nedostaje svom tati, stvara vlastiti svijet fantazije, gloms na novog prijatelja, uvjerava hrapavog starog fuddy-duddyja da se smekša i možda ga usvoji. Ali to je samo narativni kostur, a Scorsese pruža dosta krvi i mesa. Kao prvo, ne možete gledati Huga, usamljenog dječaka, kako viri iz tornjeva sa satom u vrevu pariške željezničke stanice, a da ne pomislite na Scorsesea, još jednog usamljenog dječaka, kako bulji kroz prozor svoje spavaće sobe u Elizabeth Streetu. I čak i ako nisi dovoljno veliki filmski štreber da ostvariš tu vezu, stvarno mislim da Hugovo putovanje nije u pronalaženju nove očinske figure, već u ustrajavanju sa mehaničkom magijom koja stoji kao ostavština njegovog oca. To je film: Upornost vizije koja nam omogućava da prihvatimo iluzornu verziju svijeta sa 24 okvira u sekundi su znanost i magija odjednom. Hugov odnos s Mélièsom nije u vezi s njegovim udomaćivanjem novom taticom, već dijeljenjem zajedničkog entuzijazma koji je starac potonuo u gorčinu.<br/><br/>Čak se i nekolicina detraktora filma čini spremnim priznati da su sekvence koje evociraju povijest kina i Mélièsov studio s Michaelom Stuhlbargom kao herojskim filmskim učenjakom! Činilo se, na najbolji mogući način, kao velika kompresija moje povijesti filma 101 klase na fakultetu, kondenziranje semestra vrijednosti isječaka i konteksta u nešto između montaže i animirane pop-up knjige. I govori o genijalnom dizajnu filma, koji je tako divno slojevitu činjenicu i fantaziju tako lijepo da je to odjednom povijest Mélièsa i rođenje kinematografije, i upravo vrsta jednostavnog, raskošno proizvedenog filmskog čuda koje bi Scorsese sam volio kao dijete. Hvala Bogu da Hugo ne slijedi Jeunet/Luhrmannov model i ima osjećaj za vlastitu smiješnost Ne biste li rekli da je vrijedno igrati pošteno, iskreno i neobuzdano umjesto da namigujete publici?<br/><br/>) Oglas<br/><br/>- Da, zapravo sam našao dijelove Huga očaravajućim. (Primjetite kako odgovaram na vaše pitanje unaprijed, dok ste vi bili prezauzeti pjenušanjem s apopleksijom da biste se obratili mome, iako pretpostavljam da je to odgovor u vlastitom pravu. -Utjecaj možda preuveličava slučaj. Samo sam mislio na vizualni stil koji mi je izgledao vrlo poznato. - Iako, kao što je Keith istaknuo kad ste to osobno spomenuli, Scorsese nije protiv toga da crpi inspiraciju iz tuđih vizuala, niti je imun na nju.) Prvenstveno, bio sam očaran dijelovima koji se bave Georges Mélièsovom pozadinskom pričom, njegovom ljubavlju prema kinematografiji, radom koji je uložio u svoju umjetnost i radošću koju je izvukao iz nje. Ima strašno puno ljepote i zabave u insceniranju scene podvodnog terena iz Mélièsove \"Fairyland\" i u nizu na kraju, fokusirajući se na snimke Mélièsa. I uživam u dobrom filmu o snimanju filma.<br/><br/>Osim tema koje navodite, radi se i o pronalaženju vaše svrhe, kao što likovi izričito, naporno objašnjavaju jedni drugima i nama. Radi se o spektaklu, velikim akcijskim setovima, jurnjavi i sretnom kraju gdje se čak i ljuti nasilnik i sramežljivi stariji par i fergawdsakes čak i mrzovoljni jazavčar upare sa šarmantnim ljubavnim interesima do kraja. Radi se o super-preduhitrenoj Hermioni Granger koja šefuje i živahna i pametna i hvali magične svjetove okružene knjigama i sav ovaj posao je jako poznat, i moćan umjetna.<br/><br/>) Oglas<br/><br/>Skorseze se igra sa arhetipovima, ali nikad nisam osetio da ih je prožeo neèim novim, svežim, ili ubedljivim, uprkos sopstvenoj priči. Više bih volio priču o mladom Scorseseu koji odrasta s astmom - nešto malo i stvarno, bez ogromnih prostorija punih CGI satnih i zlatnih svjetlećih prašnjavih motesa i proročkih snova i pobješnjelog odraslog tiranina-čuvara sa srcem od zlata - sve to preraslo, nad-vrhunske gluposti. Stalno navodite Scorseseovu osobnu pozadinu i ljubav prema filmu kao dokaz da stvarno osjeća ono što stavlja na ekran, ali ja ne osjećam njegov osobni dodir u bilo čemu od ovoga, osim trenutaka koji su izričito o filmu. - Jezgra emocija može biti stvarna, ali to ne čini pogubljenje manje lažnim.<br/><br/>Kažete da autentičnost emocija ne treba poricati. Ne pitam se da li se Scorsese osobno osjećao usamljeno i izolirano kao dijete, ali ne osjećam usamljenost i izolaciju na ekranu.Vidim hrpu preuveličanih znaka (Hugo je prljav i njegova odjeća se nosi i svi odrasli viču na njega i redovito ga progoni strašan pas!) i velike otkucaje, uz vikanje i plač i Spielbergovo čuđenje. Za mene je iskrenost uvjerljivija i osobnija kad je tiho i izravno; kad netko viče svoje mišljenje na mene, pretpostavljam da je ili jako ljut, ili samo pokušava preplaviti moja osjetila da me spriječi da izrazim vlastito mišljenje. Hugo je bio jedan dugi povik, što se mene tiče.<br/><br/>) Oglas<br/><br/>Zašto nisam dobio taj osjećaj za laž od Amelie, pitate se? Potpuno ću priznati da su Amélie i Moulin Rouge obje velike, manipulativne, umjetne konstrukcije u potpuno istoj veni, zahtijevaju specifične emocije u specifičnim intervalima, i pokušavaju prodati te emocije s teškim emotiranjem i agresivnim soundtrack prodingom. - Nijedan od njih mi nije stvarno prodao svoje emocije kao autentično ljudsko osećanje. Uživao sam u ta dva filma. Posebno u Amélienoj glavi, smiješnim listama nasumičnih karakterizirajućih obilježja i iskustava za glumačku postavu, i Moulin Rougeove glazbeno-magpie mashupove i rekontekstualizacije. Često se prodajem na pričama koje rade kreativne ili ambiciozne stvari sa strukturom, a oba filma se kvalifikuju, gde je Hugo mnogo linearniji, standardniji dečji upit.<br/><br/>Ali na kraju, za mene, stvarno se sve svodi na osjećaj da su ti filmovi budale, dok je Hugou suđeno da bude shvaćen ozbiljno svakog trena. Ne misliš da je to istina, ali istovremeno braniš njen integritet u smislu apsolutno autentičnog, ukorijenjenog u Skorsezovoj istoriji emocija, i govoriš mi da grešim, i on ne misli da se to uzima ozbiljno. Što vam u filmu sugerira da se ne treba uzeti u obzir? Je li moguće da je ovo samo još jedan zanimljiv slučaj poput Benjamina Buttona, gdje smatram da korištenje djece u filmovima s velikim budžetom, u velikoj mjeri šašavo i melodramatično, dok ti, kao otac, smatraš da to zaobilazi tvoj cinizam i ide ravno na tvoj obiteljski osjećaj?<br/><br/>) Oglas<br/><br/>Scott: Nisam siguran da sam mislio da Scorsese ne znači da se ozbiljno shvaća; samo je izabrao hirovito vozilo kroz koje je izrazio ozbiljnu ljubav prema filmovima. Kada kažete, \"Ali Hugo se ne bavi prvenstveno filmom, uprkos Mélièsovim vezama, zagonetna sam. Ja vam priznajem da su mnogi elementi Huga previše poznati i naporni i puni Spielbergovog čudesnog sećanja. Ne mogu ništa da uradim da se raspravljam oko te percepcije, koju drugi Hugo sumnjaju u nju. Ponekad film znači šarmirati i očarati, a nekima ne; vi imate Huga i ja imamo Amélie, iako mislim da potonji, namjerno umjetna kakav jest, znači za nas da ga smatramo romantičnim. \"Nego, recimo, neka užasna mehanička naprava prikladna za nastavak testere.\"<br/><br/>Ako se ne radi o filmu, onda je to najbesmislenija diskurzivna priča o onome o čemu misliš da se radi. Odnos između Huga i Mélièsa je srce filma, a u središtu toga nije samo neka dionička veza između Plucky Siročeta i Crusty Old Guya sa srcem od zlata, već zajednički afinitet za projektiranu magiju - specifično čaroliju filmova. Mislim da su Scorsese i njegovi suradnici pronašli način da izraze svoj entuzijazam u ranim danima kinematografije kroz fantaziju koja je dostupna svim uzrastima. - (Mmmm... pita.)<br/><br/>) Oglas<br/><br/>Što se tiče Znatiželjnog slučaja Benjamina Buttona, ne vidim mnogo povezanosti, osim što me pokušavam razotkriti kao braniča Benjamina Buttona kao način da oštetim svoj kredibilitet. (Slučajno, kako su statisti na tom G.I. Joe: Uspon Kobre Blu-ray?) Rekao sam ti da me novi tata u meni koji nije spavao možda ranjiv na Benjamina Buttona, ali ne mogu zamisliti vrijeme kada me premisa starenja u obrnutom smjeru ne bi dirnula. Kako to ne može utjecati na tebe?) Osim toga, ne vidim kako se Benjamin Button odnosi na Huga kao na film koji se odnosi na djecu, budući da je to samo mali segment priče koja obuhvaća mnogo veću putanju.<br/><br/>Ali drago mi je što Hugo nije bio potpuno lišen čarolije za tebe.<br/><br/>) Oglas<br/><br/>Ne, ne mogu reći da ste me uvjerili, ništa više nego što sam vas uvjerio. - Uglavnom ste mi dopustili da vidim Huga u Scott-O-Visionu, što je zanimljivo iskustvo; barem sam sada blago uvjeren da nekako nismo uspjeli vidjeti potpuno različite filmove koji su nekako imali isto ime i redatelja.<br/><br/>Svakako smo imali različita iskustva, iako, i po mom mišljenju, fokusirani na različite aspekte produkcije: još uvijek ne vidim da je film čudesan - tema kao jednostruki pramen filma, toliko kao jedan od previše. -Pointlessly diskursive - gotovo ga pokriva, iako bih baciti u - često nepotrebno slatko i dragocjeno - povrh toga. Dok ste fokusirani na ukusnu pitu filma, osjećam kao da je pita prekrivena kilogramom kristaliziranog šećera, i mislim da to čini razliku, bez obzira na glavnu poruku filma ili šaku sjajnih scena. Vidi također Benjamin Button, što nisam spomenuo samo da bih te zadirkivao. Stvarno mislim da imaš više sentimentalne crte od mene u vezi djece u kinu, pogotovo kada se koriste više kao simboli ranjivosti i nevinosti nego kao ljudski likovi. Znaš li koji film u potpunosti nema slatke širokooke skitnice koje donose nadu ciničnom svijetu? |
| "I hoped my daughter would be free from difficult and troubling times": Mee Mee's story as a refugee Mom<br/><br/>Hope in Times of Crisis: A Mother's Day Story<br/><br/>By Judith Santiago*<br/><br/>Mee Mee heard that the soldiers were coming. She took hold of her son and frantically joined the rest of the villagers who were running toward the Thai-Burmese border, where the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) was located. Her husband was in another village running in the opposite direction, Mee later learned. After the soldiers' pursuit ended, Mee returned home to her small village in Koechi, Burma.<br/><br/>During 1997-2000, Mee and thousands like her lived under the constant threat of violence from Burmese soldiers. Many people would take temporary refuge in the jungle, and return home to their village after soldiers left the area, just to do it all over again days later. About once a week, Mee and others would be on the move to avoid capture, rape, or death by soldiers.<br/><br/>During one incident, Mee's husband ran ahead of his wife to secure food for his family. Her husband was spotted by soldiers and shot. The bullet shattered a portion of his ribcage, leaving him severely wounded and in distress as he journeyed toward the jungle with his family for safety.<br/><br/>For three months, Mee's husband hid and moved the family with an exasperating wound at his side. He received no medical care, except for Mee's tending.<br/><br/>"I was afraid to return to Burma," Mee said through an interpreter. "I feared dying. I cried and cried every day," she continued.<br/><br/>Mee's husband eventually drew enough strength to walk five days toward a small village in Thailand where they learned the location of a hospital and a refugee camp. When Mee and her husband finally arrived at the hospital, he underwent immediate surgery and later recovered.<br/><br/>Symbol of Hope<br/><br/>Life in the jungle for those fleeing Burmese soldiers was indeed terrifying and difficult. Makeshift bamboo tents with only roof and floor coverings became suitable temporary dwellings. Many women including Mee gave birth to children in the jungle. Mee's then six-year-old son assisted in the delivery of his sister named Eh Ku Hser. Her name means love – cold – sweet. "Cold" in Burmese culture means so as to not pass through the fire of life, as heat represents troubled times.<br/><br/>"I hoped my daughter would be free from difficult and troubling times," said Mee. "I did not want her to go through what I had experienced," she continued.<br/><br/>For Mee, the birth of her daughter in the midst of darkness, torment and fear, was a symbol of hope for a new life to come. Hope in times of crisis, the very premise of the United Methodist Committee on Relief's (UMCOR) newly co-branded UMCOR-Prosperity Candle, is also the essence of that which candles shed light upon.<br/><br/>A New Beginning<br/><br/>With the help of UNHCR, hope for a new life did indeed materialize for Mee and her family when they resettled in West Springfield, Massachusetts. There, Mee met Moo Kho Paw, another woman who emigrated from Burma, and who was working at Prosperity Candle in Florence. The organization helps refugee women who have escaped areas of conflict rebuild their lives through the art of candle making. Moo Kho recommended that Mee join the organization, and Mee gladly accepted.<br/><br/>"I was excited to be out of the house," said Mee, "I was raised to believe that because I was a woman, my role was to remain at home and raise my family," she continued. "While many Burmese women want to do more for themselves, they are often encouraged to remain homemakers."<br/><br/>Today, Mee has plans to go into the candle-making business for herself and support her five children, but she expressed the need to learn English first.<br/><br/>"In the Thai refugee camp, we had education, but it was not so good," said Mee. "When I was a child, I wanted to go to school, but I was told to stay home because I was a woman. Now, I have hopes for my daughters to go to college and become doctors or policewomen," continued Mee.<br/><br/>Mee has struck an even balance in her life that she wishes others would have found—a simple, happy life where work, caring for family members and freedom of choice all have their place.<br/><br/>Support Refugee Women in the US<br/><br/>Share this Mother's Day story with your loved ones. And, when you purchase handmade candles by Mee, Moo Kho, and Naw, another Burmese refugee woman working at Prosperity Candle , know you are helping to support their livelihood as they rebuild their lives and those of their family members in the US. | Nadao sam se da će moja kćerka biti slobodna od teških i problematičnih vremena.<br/><br/>) Nada u vrijeme krize: Priča o Majčinom danu<br/><br/>Judith Santiago<br/><br/>Mee Mee je čula da vojnici dolaze. Zauzela je sina i mahnito se pridružila ostalim seljanima koji su trčali prema tajlandsko-burmanskoj granici, gdje se nalazio Ured Visokog povjerenika Ujedinjenih naroda za izbjeglice (UNHCR). Muž joj je bio u drugom selu koje je trčalo u suprotnom pravcu, Mee je kasnije saznala da se nakon završetka potjere vojnika Mee vratila kući u svoje malo selo u Koechiju u Burmi.<br/><br/>Tijekom 1997-2000. godine Mee i tisuće poput nje živjele su pod stalnom prijetnjom nasilja burmanskih vojnika. Mnogi ljudi bi se privremeno sklonili u džunglu, i vratili se kući u svoje selo nakon što su vojnici napustili područje, samo da bi to ponovili nekoliko dana kasnije. \"Oko jednom tjedno, Mee i drugi bi bili u pokretu da izbjegnu hvatanje, silovanje ili smrt vojnika.<br/><br/>Tijekom jednog incidenta, Meein muž je potrčao ispred svoje žene da osigura hranu za svoju obitelj. Metak mu je razbio dio grudnog koša, ostavljajući ga teško ranjenog i u nevolji dok je putovao prema džungli sa svojom obitelji radi sigurnosti.<br/><br/>Meein muž se tri mjeseca skrivao i premještao obitelj s razdražljivom ranom na svojoj strani.<br/><br/>Plakala sam i plakala svaki dan, nastavila je.<br/><br/>Meein muž je na kraju izvukao dovoljno snage da hoda pet dana do malog sela u Tajlandu gdje su saznali lokaciju bolnice i izbjegličkog kampa. Kada su Mee i njen muž konačno stigli u bolnicu, odmah je operisao i kasnije se oporavio.<br/><br/>Simbol nade<br/><br/>Život u džungli za one koji su bježali od burmanskih vojnika bio je zaista zastrašujuć i težak.

Nada u kriznim vremenima, sama pretpostavka Ujedinjenog metodističkog komiteta za olakšanje (UMCOR) novobrandirane UMCOR-Prosperity Candle, također je bit onoga što svijeće rasvijetljavaju.<br/><br/>Novi početak<br/><br/>Uz pomoć UNHCR-a, nada u novi život se zaista ostvarila za Mee i njenu porodicu kada su se preselili u Zapadni Springfield, Massachusetts. Tamo je Mee upoznao Moo Kho Paw, drugu ženu koja je emigrirala iz Burme, i koja je radila u Prosperity Candle u Firenci. Moo Kho preporučio je Meeu da se pridruži organizaciji, a Mee je rado prihvatila.<br/><br/>Bila sam uzbuđena što sam izašla iz kuće. Rekla je Mee, odgojena sam da vjerujem da zato što sam žena, moja uloga je bila da ostanem kod kuće i podižem obitelj. Nastavila je. Dok mnoge burmanke žele učiniti više za sebe, često ih se ohrabruje da ostanu domaćice.<br/><br/>Danas, Mee ima planove da ode u posao pravljenja svijeća za sebe i izdržava svoje petoro djece, ali je izrazila potrebu da prvo nauči engleski.<br/><br/>U tajlandskom izbjegličkom kampu imali smo obrazovanje, ali nije bilo tako dobro. - Rekao je Mee. - Kad sam bio dijete, htio sam ići u školu, ali mi je rečeno da ostanem kod kuće jer sam bio žena.

| The Precedency Essay<br/><br/>1562 words - 7 pages<br/><br/>Affirmative action is a government policy that gives opportunities to minorities, women, and any group who has been the victim of discrimination in the past. Affirmative action is the outcome of the 1960's Civil Rights movement, growing out of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 which outlawed discrimination based on race, ethnicity, or gender. It was the 1978 Supreme Court decision, The Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, which allowed for the use of race-based preferences as a means of fostering diversity, allowing affirmative action to be used in admissions policies. It was created with the intention to provide equal opportunities for members of minority groups in education and ...view middle of the document...<br/><br/>However, according to a 2007 report by the Pew Research Center, support for affirmative action among the American public has actually increased substantiallyin recent years, climbing from 58% in 1995 to 70% in 2007. Supporters of affirmative action make many arguments in support of affirmative action, in the hopes of getting others to see the genuine good that affirmative actin policies bring to our society. Supporters believe that affirmative action is more of a process rather than an admissions policy. Colleges and universities take the extra initiative to reach out to minority groups, encouraging them to apply. Colleges and universities offer additional financial aid and provide on-campus resources to help better the student's college education. Supporters also note the rising number of minority applications to colleges and universities due in part to affirmative action policies.<br/>Statistics have proven that when affirmative action is eliminated, such as when it was at Berkley College and UCLA in 1998, the minority student admissions fell 61 percent and 36 percent respectively, proving that affirmative action plays a major role in a minority students college admissions process. Affirmative action supporters also believe that diversity in higher education provides a better educational atmosphere for all students, personally and intellectually. If affirmative action were to be eliminated, there would be fewer minority students enrolled in colleges, causing diversity to be fairly slim. Affirmative action policies are also necessary in order to compensate for centuries of racial, economic, and social oppression. Individuals with a higher socioeconomic status have more opportunities than those of lower socioeconomic backgrounds. Supporters believe that certain racial or ethnic groups are disadvantaged because they are frequently in lower income households and consequently are not exposed to the same resources as students from higher socioeconomic classes. Advocates support the notion of competition between students based on merit, but argue that affirmative action compensates for economic differences. College graduates, who have benefitted from affirmative action, have also said that they received better jobs, earned more money, and overall live better lives because of the fortunate opportunities they received through affirmative action.<br/>Supporters of affirmative action continuously stress the severe importance of affirmative action, considering its contributions to enhancing both the college experience and society in general. However, opponents of affirmative action believe that the time has come to end affirmative action. Opponents believe affirmative action was created to ensure fair admission practices to bring change to a long period of racial discrimination. They believe the policy is outdated."It's time to pull the plug on race-based decision making," says Ward Connerly, a Sacramento, California businessman and lead organizer of...<br/><br/>Find Another Essay On The Precedency<br/><br/>754 words - 4 pages<br/>of the burden to continue prospering.

This tone ventures farther across that thin line as she writes about the great female Queen Elizabeth | Esej o predodređenosti<br/><br/>1562 riječi - 7 stranica<br/><br/>- Afirmativna akcija je vladina politika koja daje mogućnosti manjinama, ženama i svakoj grupi koja je bila žrtva diskriminacije u prošlosti. - Potvrdno djelovanje ishod je pokreta za građanska prava iz 1960. godine, koji je izrastao iz Zakona o građanskim pravima iz 1964. godine koji je zabranio diskriminaciju na temelju rase, etničke pripadnosti ili spola. To je bila odluka Vrhovnog suda iz 1978. godine, Regenti Univerziteta Kalifornije protiv Bakkea, koja je omogućila korištenje preferencija zasnovanih na rasama kao sredstvo za poticanje raznolikosti, što je omogućilo afirmativno djelovanje koje se koristi u politikama prihvata. Nastao je s namjerom da pruži jednake mogućnosti za pripadnike manjinskih grupa u obrazovanju i ...pogled na sredinu dokumenta...<br/><br/>Međutim, prema izvještaju Istraživačkog centra Pew za 2007. godinu, podrška afirmativnoj akciji među američkom javnošću znatno se povećala posljednjih godina, popevši se sa 58% 1995. na 70% 2007. godine. Pristalice afirmativne akcije daju mnoge argumente u prilog afirmativnoj akciji, u nadi da će druge navesti da vide istinsko dobro koje afirmativne aktinske politike donose našem društvu. Pristalice smatraju da je afirmativna akcija više proces nego politika prijema. Koledži i univerziteti preduzimaju dodatnu inicijativu da dopru do manjinskih grupa, potičući ih da se prijave. - Koledži i univerziteti nude dodatnu finansijsku pomoć i pružaju sredstva u kampusu kako bi pomogli boljem obrazovanju studenta na koledžu. Pristalice također primjećuju i sve veći broj molbi manjina na fakultete i sveučilišta zbog djelomično afirmativne akcijske politike.<br/>Statistika je dokazala da kada se afirmativna akcija eliminira, kao što je to bilo na Berkley Collegeu i UCLA 1998. godine, upis studenata manjine pao je 61 posto, odnosno 36 posto, što dokazuje da afirmativna akcija igra veliku ulogu u procesu upisa studenata manjinskih studenata na fakultete. Pristalice afirmativne akcije također vjeruju da raznolikost u visokom obrazovanju pruža bolju obrazovnu atmosferu za sve studente, osobno i intelektualno. - Ako bi se afirmativna akcija eliminirala, bilo bi manje studenata manjine upisanih na fakultete, što bi uzrokovalo da raznolikost bude prilično tanka. Potvrdne akcijske politike su također nužne kako bi se nadoknadila višestoljetna rasna, ekonomska i socijalna ugnjetavanja. Pojedinci s višim socioekonomskim statusom imaju više mogućnosti od onih niže socioekonomske pozadine. Pristalice vjeruju da su određene rasne ili etničke grupe u nepovoljnom položaju jer su često u kućanstvima s nižim prihodima i posljedično nisu izložene istim resursima kao studenti iz viših socioekonomskih razreda. - Zagovornici podržavaju pojam konkurencije između studenata na osnovu zasluga, ali tvrde da afirmativna akcija nadoknađuje ekonomske razlike. diplomci koledža, koji su imali koristi od afirmativne akcije, također su rekli da su dobili bolje poslove, zaradili više novca, i sveukupno žive bolje živote zbog sretnih prilika koje su dobili afirmativnom akcijom.<br/>Pristalice afirmativnog djelovanja kontinuirano naglašavaju veliku važnost afirmativnog djelovanja, uzimajući u obzir njegove doprinose poboljšanju i iskustva fakulteta i društva općenito. Međutim, protivnici afirmativne akcije smatraju da je došlo vrijeme da se okonča afirmativna akcija. Protivnici vjeruju da je stvorena afirmativna akcija kako bi se osiguralo pošteno prijamne prakse kako bi se donijela promjena u dugom razdoblju rasne diskriminacije. Vjeruju da je politika zastarjela, vrijeme je da prekinemo rasno odlučivanje, kaže Ward Connerly, poslovni čovjek iz Sacramenta, Kalifornija i glavni organizator...<br/><br/>\"Pronađi drugi Esej o predodređenosti\"<br/><br/>Iako je Jackson stvorio i potpisao sve za Indijanski zakon o uklanjanju, taj čin neće stupiti na snagu tek nakon Jacksonovog prethodstva.<br/>Jackson je bio čovjek naroda, radnik, i vjerovao je da će banka imati koristi samo bogatima i ljudima koji su imali novca u banci.

| Combinations<br/><br/>Combinations Are defenses against a punch, choreographed responses to different types of attacks. They have many names across the martial arts but (in my experience) every art has a version of them. This makes them different than forms because there are plenty of martial arts that have no forms. What makes there partner exercises so universal? Why practice a specific response when (in reality) timing, type of attack, size of the attacker, and a hundred other factors will make it so you never use that entire choreographed response? And finally, how can we practice for a real defense situation and avoid injury at the same time?<br/><br/>The universality of combinations is impressive, to say the least. Our style of Kenpo karate has a list of 108 combos that can be learned. (Most students only learn 20-30 though) In Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu you spend whole classes practicing arm bars and chokes, learning every subtlety to the move while your partner offers little to no resistance. Every boxer has spent hours in front of the bag and/or mirror throwing the same combination of punches until their body moves by reflex alone. Combinations are universal because we have no better way to introduce movement and then practice the subtle positions required to make them work. Hitting a small pressure point through clothing takes A LOT of practice, catching an arm bar with control requires a carefully placed hip and a sneaky setup, and a great combination is only useful if you can through it from a balanced and protected position. Can you think of a better way to gain these skills?<br/><br/>There is any number of factors that determine how you respond to an attack and whether in a sparring match or in a fight, I have NEVER used a full combination in my defense. Why, then, do we spend hours practicing them? We practice these choreographed responses because the objective is not to pull combination 8 out every time you see a hook punch but to show you one way of blocking it and then a possible way to follow it up. I have never chosen to use combination 3 in a reality situation but the block is one of my go-to moves. Combinations add tools to the toolbox they do not fix the car.<br/><br/>The last question is a question of safety. If we practice for the sake of reality we need to replicate reality. How do we prevent injury while doing so? When it comes down to it, it's about building trust. We start slow and learn to trust that we have control over ourselves. We learn to trust our partners have control as well. In more time we learn to trust our control over our partner and (a little scarier) we learn to trust our partner's control over us. In the end (with a lot of practice) you can move are full speed, tossing your partner, and being thrown without fear of injury.<br/><br/>Combinations are universal for a reason; they are practiced so they can be dissected into their parts, and we stay safe by starting slow and building trust. As with everything else in the martial arts, combinations have many reasons behind their practice and execution. | Kombinacije<br/><br/>Kombinacije su odbrana od punča, koreografisani odgovori na različite vrste napada, imaju mnoga imena širom borilačkih veština, ali (po mom iskustvu) svaka umetnost ima svoju verziju. To ih čini drugačijima od oblika jer ima dosta borilačkih vještina koje nemaju forme. Zašto prakticirati specifičan odgovor kada (u stvarnosti) tajming, vrsta napada, veličina napadača, i stotine drugih faktora će to učiniti tako da nikada ne iskoristite cijeli taj koreografirani odgovor? I na kraju, kako možemo vježbati za pravu obrambenu situaciju i izbjegavati ozljede u isto vrijeme?<br/><br/>Naš stil Kenpo karatea ima listu 108 kombinacija koje se mogu naučiti. U Brazilskom Jiu-Jitsuu provodite čitave časove vježbajući rešetke za ruke i gušeći se, učeći svaku suptilnost poteza dok vaš partner ne pruža malo otpora. - Svaki boksač je proveo sate ispred torbe i/ili ogledala bacajući istu kombinaciju udaraca dok se njihovo tijelo ne pomakne refleksom samo. - Kombinacije su univerzalne jer nemamo bolji način da uvedemo pokret i onda vježbamo suptilne pozicije potrebne da bi radile. - Udaranje male tačke pritiska kroz odeću zahteva mnogo prakse, hvatanje šipke za ruku sa kontrolom zahteva pažljivo postavljen kuk i podmukao postav, a velika kombinacija je korisna samo ako možete kroz nju iz uravnoteženog i zaštićenog položaja. Možeš li smisliti bolji način da stekneš te vještine?<br/><br/>Zašto ih onda satima vježbamo? Vježbamo te koreografske odgovore jer cilj nije izvući kombinaciju 8 svaki put kad vidite udarac u kuku već vam pokazati jedan način blokiranja, a onda mogući način da ga pratite. Kombinacije dodaju alat u kutiju za alat koji ne popravljaju auto.<br/><br/>Ako vježbamo zbog stvarnosti, moramo replicirati stvarnost, kako spriječiti ozljedu dok to činimo? Počnemo polako i naučimo vjerovati da imamo kontrolu nad sobom, naučimo vjerovati da i naši partneri imaju kontrolu, a nakon više vremena naučimo vjerovati svojoj kontroli nad partnerom i (malo strašnije) naučimo vjerovati partnerovoj kontroli nad nama. - Na kraju (uz mnogo prakse) možete se kretati punom brzinom, bacanjem partnera i bacanjem bez straha od povrede.<br/><br/>- Kombinacije su univerzalne s razlogom; prakticiraju se tako da se mogu secirati na njihove dijelove, a mi ostajemo sigurne tako što počinjemo sporo i gradimo povjerenje. - Kao i sve ostalo u borilačkim vještinama, kombinacije imaju mnogo razloga iza svoje prakse i egzekucije. |
