| UNDERSTANDING SELF-EXECUTING TREATIES VIA STATE PRACTICE<br/><br/>Updated: Feb 2<br/><br/>Introduction:<br/><br/>Consider this paradox, when a country ratifies a treaty, it is said to have consented to accept the treaty in its entirety (reservations and declarations being exceptions); but in some cases, the countries go ahead and refuse to adhere to its provisions. For example, Article VI, Clause 2 of the American Constitution has the provisions that "all treaties … shall be the supreme Law of the Land." Although it is evident that treaties on their own do not have the same effect as federal laws. In truth, they only become operational once these provisions come into force as Federal law with Senate and Presidential approval. Although this is the practice, it is a generally accepted principle in international law that certain treaties have a binding effect on countries. The treaty must fulfil the requirement of being a self-executing treaty to affect the country without any corresponding domestic legislature directly.<br/><br/>This raises the question as to which treaty will qualify as "self-executing" and which will not?<br/><br/>Whether a treaty is a self-executing treaty or not is decided by national judges on a case-to-case basis (Buergenthal, 1992). In order to understand this, the paper will first look at the two types of theories followed by countries on the nature of treaties applying to domestic law. These two theories are monism and dualism. They basically view the framework of domestic and international law as a single hierarchy and two separate hierarchies, respectively (Wildhaber, 1971). Countries following monism believe that certain treaties immediately are binding and immediately have an effect on the country. Once the treaty has been ratified, it can be invoked in national courts and is considered to be a part of the law of the country. Countries following dualism believe that a treaty does not affect domestic law until it has been reinforced by a legislature passed in the parliament. An example of dualism is how the European Convention on Human Rights became operational in the United Kingdom after passing the Human Rights Act 1998 in their parliament (Laws, 2000).<br/><br/>International law is diverse, and so are the types of procedures different countries follow for the acceptance of treaties. Some constitutions' themselves mention the procedures for the ratification of a treaty. Some countries even have different treatment given to international treaty law and customary international law. Certain international organizations like the European Union often affect the domestic law of its member states. The member states of the European Union have to give effect to certain forms of community legislature. Although, it has an essential difference from self-executing treaties. The difference is that it is not for national judges to decide whether the provisions are self-executing or not, but rather for the European Court of Justice to interpret under its constitutive treaties. Other forms of international law formed via resolutions or such might not have the same effect for these states. Nevertheless, they might consider them as forms of "soft law" and look into them to interpret the intent of the law. Sometimes, proclamations made by the judicial organs of international organizations such as the Inter-American Court of Human Rights affect their member states. Although these proclamations are not binding on the member states, the national judges seem to refer to these for authoritative interpretation.<br/><br/>Therefore, a case-to-case approach must be taken while analyzing the procedures and precedents set in different countries. To examine the concept of self-executing treaties, this paper will compare the precedents set by different jurisdictions. If the reader wishes to conduct a similar analysis, they can do so by looking into the different national yearbooks on international law. Mostly, these yearbooks will have a section devoted to the relationship between international and national law.<br/><br/>International Jurisprudence:<br/><br/>The most significant issue that comes up for national courts is whether the treaty is self-executing? If the treaty can be applied without any additional domestic legislature having passed to reinforce it. This question came up in the case of Czesław S v State Treasury and Minister of the State Treasury, wherein the Polish Constitutional Court held that since the treaty provisions referred to domestic measures to be taken, the treaty was not self-executing in nature (Bug river claims, Czesław S v State Treasury and Minister of the State Treasury, 2003). Essentially, when the treaty refers to domestic measures to be taken, it does not in itself create new obligations. It instead reinforces the treaty's intent for the domestic legal process to take measures for the same. A similar issue was raised in the Sosa case in the United States of America. In this case, the court considered whether the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights was a self-executing treaty. The American Supreme Court has also declared that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is not a self-executing treaty (Court, 2004). The Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland also examined the self-executing nature of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The issue before the court was whether Article 13(2)(b) and (c) were self-executing in nature. The court examined whether the treaty was partially self-executing and did so by checking whether there existed a minimum core content for the treaty to be applicable. The court held that it found no such provision within the treaty (A and B v Government of the Canton of Zurich, 2000).<br/><br/>It is essential to understand that these issues differ from the fundamental question of whether international law can be applied as part of the law of the land? In order to answer this question, the paper will examine the judgement by the Supreme Court of the Dominican Republic. The Supreme Court stated that Article 3 of the Dominican Republic's Constitution made international law binding on the domestic legal order. The court rejected the Superior Land Court's interpretation that these treaties were "foreign legislature" and not part of the domestic legal order. The Supreme Court laid down that all treaties ratified by the Dominican Republic formed a part of Dominican Law and, therefore, can be termed as self-executing (Gallardo Montilla v Gallardo Concepción and ors, 1997). The Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland has examined whether the Libson Treaty was self-executing and directly applicable to Swiss Universities. The court held, "According to relevant case law, a treaty norm is directly applicable if its content is sufficiently precise and clear to form the basis of a decision in a particular case. The norm thus has to be justiciable, i.e. define the rights and obligations of an individual and be directed at the competent authorities" (X v University of Lucerne, 2014). This implies that whether the treaty is directly applicable or not, depends upon on whether the norm is justiciable. The Lisbon Treaty is based on the principle of qualifications acquired aboard. This is conveyed through Article IV (1) of the treaty. The purpose of this was to create an obligation for states to show that their decision-making process is fair, transparent and non-discriminatory. The responsibility for proving that the applicant has not met the required criteria is on the "body undertaking the assessment." The treaty guarantees procedural safeguards, which are generally accepted by countries and hence, the court held this treaty to be self-executing. This goes on to showcase the different interpretations undertaken by the courts of various countries.<br/><br/>It is essential to observe whether the norms set out by treaties are actually being complied with. The case laws from various jurisdictions have emphasized that national courts are the final authority on the issue of whether a treaty is self-executing. There is also an inherent duty cast on countries for the observance and due performance of treaties. Such is cast by the Pacta Sunt Servanda rule as enshrined within Article 26 of the Vienna Convention on Law of Treaties (VCLT). Article 27 goes on to reinforce it by stating that international law obligations cannot be ignored by using domestic law as a justification. Many countries' courts have used this as a source of interpretation, such as the Latvian Constitutional Court. In the case of a national norm conflicting with an international norm, the court held that the national norm was null and void. To reach its conclusion, the court strongly relied on the necessary performance of treaties in good faith as envisaged in Article 26 of the VCLT (Linija v Latvia, 2004).<br/><br/>Conclusion:<br/><br/>From the above, it is clear that treaties have particular requirements before they can be considered self-executing. However, keeping all of these aside, the most important still remains the national courts' interpretation. The national courts decide whether the treaty can be called self-executing or not. Although their Constitution's might contain a provision regarding treaty law being the supreme law of the land, courts from different countries interpret these provisions in different manners. This can be seen as to how the American and Dominican Constitutions' both contain these provisions but follow completely different interpretations of the same. The term "self-executing" may not be congruous for these treaties since, in practice, they still need approval from the national courts. Ideally, the way forward should be that countries acknowledge the self-executing nature of treaties and treat them in a fashion wherein Article 26 and 27 of the VCLT are respected. Again, this is the "ideal" situation and is not likely to find its way into state practice of certain jurisdictions anytime soon. Still, hope can be gained via looking into the interpretations of national courts that respect these norms and hopefully pave the way for other courts to acknowledge this.<br/><br/>References:<br/><br/>Buergenthal, T.

Na primjer, članak VI., klauzula 2 američkog Ustava ima odredbe koje - svi ugovori ... će biti vrhovni zakon zemlje - iako je očito da sporazumi sami po sebi nemaju isti učinak kao federalni zakoni. Zapravo, one postaju operativne tek kada te odredbe stupi na snagu kao savezni zakon sa senatom i predsjedničkim odobrenjem. - Iako je to praksa, općeprihvaćeno je načelo u međunarodnom pravu da određeni ugovori imaju obvezujući učinak na zemlje. Sporazum mora da ispuni uslov da bude samoizvršni ugovor da bi direktno uticao na zemlju bez odgovarajućeg domaćeg zakonodavca.<br/><br/>To postavlja pitanje koji sporazum će se kvalificirati kao samoizvršavanje, a koji neće?<br/><br/>- Da li je sporazum samoizvršni sporazum ili ne o njemu odlučuju nacionalni suci na osnovi slučaja u slučaj (Buergenthal, 1992). Kako bi se to shvatilo, u radu će se prvo pogledati dvije vrste teorija nakon kojih slijede zemlje o prirodi ugovora koji se primjenjuju na domaće pravo. Oni u osnovi vide okvir domaćeg i međunarodnog prava kao jedinstvenu hijerarhiju i dvije zasebne hijerarhije, odnosno (Wildhaber, 1971). Zemlje koje prate monizam vjeruju da su određeni ugovori odmah obvezujući i odmah imaju učinak na zemlju. jednom kada je sporazum ratificiran, može se pozvati na nacionalne sudove i smatra se dijelom zakona zemlje. - Zemlje koje prate dualizam vjeruju da sporazum ne utječe na domaće pravo dok ga ne ojača zakonodavac usvojen u parlamentu. - Primjer dualizma je kako je Europska konvencija o ljudskim pravima postala operativna u Ujedinjenom Kraljevstvu nakon donošenja Zakona o ljudskim pravima 1998. u njihovom parlamentu (Zakon, 2000).<br/><br/>Međunarodno pravo je raznoliko, kao i vrste postupaka koje različite zemlje slijede za prihvaćanje ugovora. Određene međunarodne organizacije poput Europske unije često utječu na domaće pravo svojih država članica. - Države članice Europske unije moraju dati efekt na određene oblike zakona zajednice, iako ima bitnu razliku u odnosu na samoizvršavanje ugovora. Razlika je u tome što nacionalni suci ne odlučuju da li su odredbe samoizvršne ili ne, nego da Europski sud pravde interpretira na temelju svojih konstitutivnih ugovora. Drugi oblici međunarodnog prava formirani putem rezolucija ili slično možda neće imati isti učinak za te države, pa ipak, oni bi ih mogli smatrati oblicima \"mekog prava\" i razmotriti ih kako bi protumačili namjeru zakona. Ponekad, proglasi pravosudnih organa međunarodnih organizacija kao što je Međuamerički sud za ljudska prava utiču na njihove države članice. - Iako ovi proglasi nisu obvezujući za zemlje članice, čini se da se nacionalni suci odnose na ove za autoritativno tumačenje.<br/><br/>Kako bi se ispitao koncept samoizvršavanja ugovora, ovaj rad će usporediti presedane postavljene različitim jurisdikcijama. Ako čitatelj želi provesti sličnu analizu, to može učiniti tako što će pogledati različite nacionalne godišnjake o međunarodnom pravu.<br/><br/>Međunarodna jurisdikcija:<br/><br/>Najznačajnije pitanje koje se postavlja za nacionalne sudove je da li je sporazum samoizvršavanje? Ako se sporazum može primijeniti bez ikakvih dodatnih domaćih zakonodavaca koji su ga usvojili da bi ga ojačali. Ovo pitanje pojavilo se u slučaju Czesław S v Državne riznice i ministra državne riznice, pri čemu je u poljskom Ustavnom sudu utvrđeno da, budući da su se odredbe sporazuma odnosile na domaće mjere koje treba poduzeti, sporazum nije bio samoizvršavajući u prirodi (tvrđenja Bug Rivera, Czesław S v Državne riznice i ministar državne riznice, 2003). U osnovi, kada se sporazum odnosi na domaće mjere koje treba poduzeti, on ne stvara sam po sebi nove obveze, nego jača namjeru sporazuma da domaći pravni proces poduzme mjere za isto. Sličan problem pokrenut je i u slučaju Sosa u Sjedinjenim Američkim Državama. U ovom slučaju sud je razmotrio da li je Međunarodni savez o građanskim i političkim pravima samoizvršni sporazum. - Američki Vrhovni sud je također proglasio da Međunarodni savez o građanskim i političkim pravima nije samoizvršni sporazum (Sud, 2004). - Federalni Vrhovni sud Švicarske također je ispitao samoizvršnu prirodu Međunarodnog saveza o građanskim i političkim pravima . Pitanje pred sudom bilo je da li su član 13(2)(b) i (c) samoizvršivali u prirodi. Sud je ispitao da li je sporazum djelomice samoizvršavao i to učinio provjeravajući postoji li minimalni sadržaj jezgre da bi se sporazum primjenjivao. - Sud je smatrao da ne nalazi takvu odredbu u okviru sporazuma (A i B v Vlada Kantona Zürich, 2000).<br/><br/>Važno je shvatiti da se ta pitanja razlikuju od temeljnog pitanja može li se međunarodno pravo primijeniti kao dio zakona zemlje? da bi se odgovorilo na ovo pitanje, rad će ispitati presudu Vrhovnog suda Dominikanske Republike. Vrhovni sud je naveo da je članak 3. Ustava Dominikanske Republike učinio međunarodno pravo obvezujućim za domaći pravni poredak. Sud je odbacio tumačenje Vrhovnog zemljišnog suda da su ti ugovori - strani zakonodavci - a ne dio domaćeg pravnog poretka. Vrhovni sud je odredio da svi ugovori koje je ratificirala Dominikanska Republika formiraju dio Dominikanskog zakona i stoga se mogu nazvati samoizvršavanjem (Gallardo Montilla v Gallardo Concepción and ors, 1997). - Federalni Vrhovni sud Švicarske je ispitao je li Ugovor o Libsonu bio samoizvršni i izravno primjenjiv na švicarske univerzitete. Sud je, prema mjerodavnom sudskom pravu, ugovorna norma je izravno primjenjiva ako je njen sadržaj dovoljno precizan i jasan da bi se formirala osnova odluke u određenom slučaju. - Norma na taj način mora biti opravdana, odnosno definirati prava i obveze pojedinca i biti usmjerena na nadležna tijela - (X v University of Lucerne, 2014). To podrazumijeva da da li je sporazum izravno primjenjiv ili ne, ovisi o tome je li norma opravdana. Lisabonski ugovor temelji se na načelu kvalifikacija stečenih na brodu. Svrha toga bila je stvoriti obvezu država da pokažu da je njihov proces donošenja odluka pravedan, transparentan i nediskriminirajući. Odgovornost za dokazivanje da podnositelj zahtjeva nije ispunio potrebne kriterije je na tijelu koje poduzima procjenu Sporazum jamči proceduralne zaštitne mjere, koje su općeprihvaćene od strane zemalja i stoga je sud smatrao da je ovaj sporazum samoizvršavanje.<br/><br/>Neophodno je promatrati da li se norme utvrđene ugovorima zapravo poštuju.Slučajni zakoni iz raznih jurisdikcija naglasili su da su nacionalni sudovi konačna vlast po pitanju da li je sporazum samoizvršavanje. Postoji i inherentna dužnost koja se vrši na zemlje radi držanja i obavljanja ugovora, a takva je vladavina Pacta Sunt Servanda koja je sadržana u članku 26. Bečke konvencije o pravu ugovora (VCLT). Član 27 nastavlja ga jačati navodeći da se obveze međunarodnog prava ne mogu zanemariti korištenjem domaćeg prava kao opravdanja. sudovi mnogih zemalja su to koristili kao izvor tumačenja, kao što je Ustavni sud Latvije. - U slučaju nacionalne norme u sukobu s međunarodnom normom, sud je smatrao da je nacionalna norma bila ništavna i nevažeća. da bi došao do zaključka, sud se snažno oslanjao na nužno obavljanje ugovora u dobroj vjeri kako je predviđeno u članku 26. VCLT-a (Linija v Latvija, 2004).<br/><br/>Zaključak:<br/><br/>Iz gore navedenog jasno je da ugovori imaju posebne zahtjeve prije nego što se mogu smatrati samoizvršenim, ali, držeći sve to po strani, najvažnije i dalje ostaje tumačenje nacionalnih sudova. Nacionalni sudovi odlučuju da li se sporazum može nazvati samoizvršavanjem ili ne. - Iako bi njihov Ustav mogao sadržavati odredbu o ugovornom pravu kao vrhovnom zakonu zemlje, sudovi iz različitih zemalja tumače ove odredbe na različite načine. To se može vidjeti kako američki i dominikanski ustav sadrže ove odredbe, ali slijede potpuno različita tumačenja istog. Termin samoizvršavanje možda nije u skladu s tim ugovorima jer im u praksi još uvijek treba odobrenje nacionalnih sudova. Idealno bi trebalo biti da zemlje priznaju samoizvršnu prirodu ugovora i da ih tretiraju na način na koji se poštuju članci 26. i 27. VCLT-a. - Opet, ovo je - idealna - situacija i nije vjerojatno da će naći put u državnu praksu određenih jurisdikcija u skorije vrijeme. Ipak, nada se može steći razmatranjem tumačenja nacionalnih sudova koji poštuju te norme i nadamo se da će drugi sudovi utrti put da to priznaju.<br/><br/>Reference:<br/><br/>Buergenthal, T. (1992).

| Behind-the-Scenes Tragedies That Affected the Cast of TV's Deadliest Catch<br/><br/>Lowered Fishing Quotas<br/><br/>Even though the crew on Deadliest Catch make the majority of their money from Discovery, that doesn't mean they don't actually sell their haul. So, you could say they have two sources of income, which is something that most people in their line of work don't have.<br/><br/>However, back in 2017, the Alaska Department of Fish and Game started a quota system, which limited the amount of fish any fishing boat could bring back to shore by half. That meant the crew on Deadliest Catch experienced a huge drop in profits for several years. Hey, at least they have Discovery to pay the bills, right? | Tragedije iza scene koje su uticale na najsmrtonosnije hvatanje TV-a<br/><br/>\"Spuštene ribarske kvote\"<br/><br/>- Iako posada u Najsmrtonosnijem ulovu zaradi većinu svog novca od Discoveryja, to ne znači da zapravo ne prodaju svoj teret. Dakle, moglo bi se reći da imaju dva izvora prihoda, što je nešto što većina ljudi u svom poslu nema.<br/><br/>Međutim, 2017. godine Aljaska Department of Fish and Game pokrenuo je sistem kvota, koji je ograničio količinu ribe koju svaki ribarski brod može dovesti na obalu za pola. Barem imaju Discovery da plate račune, zar ne? |

| BLOGS<br/><br/>Check out our collection of blogs written by fellow staff members.<br/><br/>INFORMATIONAL BLOGS<br/><br/>Don't Stress It<br/><br/>by<br/>Kristen Hogan<br/>&#124; Nov 12, 2020<br/><br/>Stress, no matter how great things are going, it can always find a way to rear its ugly head. Whether it is a last-minute job request or a paper that you forgot to write and it is due the next day, stress can always find a way into your day if you allow it. Today I will show you a few things you can do to eliminate or prevent stress.<br/><br/>The first thing you can do is to exercise. Exercising is a great way to relieve stress because it lowers the stress hormone in your body known as cortisol. The lower levels of cortisol in your body, the lower your stress level will be. Exercise can also increase your confidence, and when your confidence is up then your stress is usually down. For me, when I get stressed, I always exercise by going to the gym and practice boxing, it helps me burn calories and reduce stress while having fun.<br/><br/>Writing things down has been a way to calm people down for a very long time, and it is the next topic on our list. Writing down what is making you stressed is a way to clear the mind, and it helps get rid of stress as well. I have a similar experience when writing stories, usually if I cannot think of a new idea because of an old one, I will write the old idea down and think on it. That is when new ideas start to spring up and I can continue writing normally. It is the same with stress. Think about a stream it continues to flow down it's path until it hits a beaver dam, and that dam blocks the flow of water and everything starts to build up. The only way to get the water flow back to normal is to remove the dam. This is where writing comes in. When you write it down, you are removing stress piece by piece until you can think normally again.<br/><br/>Stress can come into our lives through doors in our life that we keep open. Procrastination is a way that we can leave the doors open for stress. Waiting until tomorrow may be fun for today, but it will hurt you tomorrow, and is a very short-sighted solution. The longer you wait to do something, the larger that something becomes, and the larger it becomes the more stress you will be inviting into your life. Taking care of something as soon as we receive it is a great way to prevent stress, but it is something that takes great discipline to do. The more you cut Procrastination out of your life, the more stress free you will be. So shut that door, you're letting all the cold air out.<br/><br/>So let's review: Exercise, Write down what is stressing you, and Do not Procrastinate. These are only a few ways to relieve stress but to me, they are the most effective. While I know these may not work for everyone I would like to invite anyone feeling stressed to research how to get rid of it. | BLOGS<br/><br/>- Pogledajte našu kolekciju blogova koje su napisali kolege članovi osoblja.<br/><br/>- INFORMACIJSKE BLOGE<br/><br/>Nemoj da ga stresiraš.<br/><br/>Do<br/>Kristen Hogan<br/>Ş Nov 12, 2020<br/><br/>Stres, bez obzira kako se stvari odvijaju, uvijek može pronaći način da podigne svoju ružnu glavu, bilo da je to zahtjev za posao u zadnji tren ili rad koji si zaboravio napisati i koji je zbog sljedećeg dana, stres uvijek može pronaći put u tvoj dan ako to dopustiš. Danas ću vam pokazati nekoliko stvari koje možete učiniti da eliminirate ili spriječite stres.<br/><br/>Vježbanje je odličan način za ublažavanje stresa jer snižava hormon stresa u vašem tijelu poznat kao kortizol, niži nivo kortizola u vašem tijelu, niži nivo stresa će biti. Vježbe također mogu povećati vaše povjerenje, a kada vam je samopouzdanje povišeno onda je stres obično smanjen. Za mene, kad sam pod stresom, uvijek vježbam odlaskom u teretanu i vježbanjem boksa, pomaže mi sagorijevati kalorije i smanjiti stres dok se zabavljam.<br/><br/>Zapisivanje stvari je način da smiriš ljude jako dugo, a to je sljedeća tema na našoj listi. Imam slično iskustvo kad pišem priče, obično ako ne mogu smisliti novu ideju zbog stare, zapisat ću staru ideju i razmisliti o njoj. Razmislite o potoku koji nastavlja da teče niz njegovu stazu dok ne udari u branu dabrova, i ta brana blokira protok vode i sve se počinje nakupljati. Kada zapisujete, uklanjate stres dio po dio dok ne možete normalno razmišljati.<br/><br/>Stres može ući u naše živote kroz vrata u našem životu koja držimo otvorenim. - Čekanje do sutra može biti zabavno za danas, ali to će vas povrijediti sutra, i vrlo je kratkovidno rješenje. - Što duže čekate da nešto uradite, to je nešto veće, i što je ono veće, to ćete više stresa pozivati u svoj život. To je odličan način da se spriječi stres, ali to je nešto što zahtijeva veliku disciplinu za učiniti. Zatvori ta vrata, puštaš sav hladan vazduh napolje.<br/><br/>To je samo nekoliko načina da se oslobodi stresa, ali za mene, oni su najučinkovitiji. - Iako znam da ovo ne može raditi za svakoga želim pozvati bilo koga tko se osjeća pod stresom da istraži kako ga se riješiti. |
