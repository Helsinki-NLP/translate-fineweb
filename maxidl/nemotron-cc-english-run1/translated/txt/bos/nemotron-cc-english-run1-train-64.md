| Smith Chuck - Through the Bible C2000 SeriesShall we turn to the book of Acts, chapter one, as we begin our study of the early church.<br/>Luke, the author of the book of Acts, a companion of Paul the apostle, who was author also of the Gospel According to Luke, wrote these two treatises to a friend, Theophilus. Theophilus is a Greek name. It's a name that has a beautiful meaning. The name means lover of God. There are some who believe that it was not a man at all, but that the gospel and the book of Acts were addressed to the lovers of God, whoever you may be. There are other traditions that say that Theophilus was actually Luke's master. That in those days physicians were slaves, usually the slave of a wealthy patron. So that Luke's master was Theophilus, and he released Luke to be with Paul on the missionary journeys. Thus, Luke is writing back to his former master. This is an early tradition of the church, but it is, of course, impossible to prove, like so many of the traditions.<br/>There are also those who believe that when Paul was in Troas and he received a vision of a man calling unto him saying, "Come over to Macedonia and help us," that that man in Paul's vision was none other than Luke. For the first one that Paul really met when he came to Macedonia was Luke. And as we are in the book of Acts, you will find that when we get to that portion of the book of Acts, Luke begins to write more in the first person rather than the third person. So it is, evidently, at this particular point in the Acts of the Apostles that Luke became a companion of Paul and began to journey with him. He began to use the pronouns "we" and "us" instead of "they" and "them." This is, no doubt, where Luke became a participant and an eyewitness of those things that were happening from this point on. We will bring this out to you when we get to that point.<br/>He begins the Acts of the Apostles by tying it with the Gospel According to Luke. It is interesting that the very last thing that Luke records in his gospel is the very first thing he records in the Acts of the Apostles. We find the gospel of Luke closing as Jesus is telling His disciples to wait in Jerusalem until they be endued with power from on high. And then Jesus ascended up into heaven, and so he closes the gospel. In opening the Acts of the Apostles, he writes,<br/>The former treatise [that is, the Gospel According to Luke,] have I written unto you, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and teach ( Act 1:1 ),<br/>The key word is began. The Gospel According to Luke is not the full story of the ministry of Jesus Christ. It is only the beginning of the ministry of Jesus Christ. Jesus continues to minister to the needs of people. Jesus continues to heal the sick. Jesus continues to raise the dead. Jesus continues to minister His love and His gospel to the world, only now He is ministering through those disciples who have been anointed with His Holy Spirit. But the ministry of Christ is continuing; basically, is the premise that Luke takes in the Acts of the Apostles. The former treatise of all that Jesus began, both to do and to teach.<br/>Now because of that, the Acts of the Apostles is an unfinished book: in that the Lord today continues to work through the lives of those who have dedicated themselves to be the instruments of God. To be led and guided and anointed by His Holy Spirit, to continue the ministry of Jesus in the world today. Now God has ordained that His work should be accomplished through human instruments. I do not say that it must be accomplished. God can use angelic beings for His work, and there will come a time, during the book of Revelation when God will use angels to proclaim His gospel to people all over the world. Revelation, chapter 14, "The first angel flying through the midst of heaven having the everlasting gospel" ( Rev 14:6 ). But at the present time, God has chosen to use human instruments. As imperfect as they may be, yet that's what God has ordained to use. The exciting thing about that is, God will use me and God will use you. So many times, we're begging off, "O Lord, I can't speak. I've never been able to speak before or even now, Lord." As Moses tried to beg off the call of God. Jeremiah said, "Lord, I'm just a kid; no one's going to listen to me." And we all have our excuses why we can't be used. Don't we? We all know the reasons why God couldn't use us.<br/>One time, as the Lord was calling a prophet to do His work, he said, "Lord, send whoever you want." The Lord said, "Hey, I've called you." "Lord, good idea; send whoever you want." So often we're in that position, "Lord, send by the hand of whomsoever you will, anybody but me Lord." And yet, God has ordained to use us.<br/>Now, each of us can show our own imperfections. Each of us can point out our own inabilities, and all of us can find an excuse why God wouldn't want to use me. But yet, God has chosen to use you. That through your life He might reveal Himself to a needy world. You wonder when God has such instruments to use how He ever got the job done, don't you?<br/>Until the day in which he was taken up, after that he through the Holy Spirit had given commandments to the apostles whom he had chosen ( Act 1:2 ):<br/>That is what he ended the Gospel of Luke with. The day that Jesus was taken up, after He had told the apostles to wait for the endowment of power.<br/>To whom he also [that is the apostles he also] showed himself alive to them after his passion [or death] by many infallible proofs ( Act 1:3 ),<br/>It is difficult to deny the fact of the resurrection of Jesus Christ. I was amused, as well as annoyed and irritated, by an article I read in the Santa Ana Register this last Saturday. Of the creation science and evolutionary theories being presented in the county schools. How that, this one professor said that he teaches a science class, and thus, they deal only in facts, and that they don't have any place for theories. Because science is based upon fact and creation is based upon religious superstitions. It takes a lot of faith to believe the religious theories. When you are dealing with facts, you can just accept them. I thought, "Very interesting in that science class, they taught me it was a fact that the world was four billion years old. Now today they are teaching it's a fact that the world is twelve billion years old. And it wasn't that long ago that I went to school."<br/>It's interesting that the Bible has never needed to be revised or updated to meet the current data that men have discovered. And yet, if you would take my high school science textbooks today and try to teach a science class from them, you would find that many of the things that were taught as scientific fact when I was in high school are no longer recognized as scientific fact. The simple cell protoplasm is no longer a simple cell, but extremely complex. If there is any fact that can be attested to in history it is the fact of the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.<br/>We have a jurisprudence system that is based upon the testimony of witnesses. If a man is accused of a crime and there are people who witnessed that crime while it was being committed, and they are brought to the standard, and they swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help them God. And in their questioning they affirm that, "I saw that man in the bank on May twenty-third. I saw him pull out a gun from his coat. I heard him demand that all of the money be given to him. I saw him as he left the bank. I saw him as the officer apprehended him outside." And if you can get three or four witnesses to point to that man and will keep their testimony under cross-examination, that man is judged to be guilty. He is the one who did it. We have two or three witnesses that are testifying the same story about that man, and it is accepted as fact that he is the one who perpetrated the crime and is guilty. You've got witnesses who have sworn to tell the truth that are verifying.<br/>After the death of Jesus, when He rose again, He appeared unto many different people who gave sworn testimony that they saw Him. That they talked to Him, that He appeared to them in various places under different circumstances. And for a period of forty days was visiting with them. And at one time, up to as many as five hundred people who were gathered at one place, He appeared. It's difficult to just cast aside or deny the witness of these people. To do so is to discredit our whole jurisprudence system. But not only that, these men who testified that they saw the risen Lord, that they talked to Him, that they ate with Him, they, all of them, with the exception of one, met violent deaths at the hands of other people because of their affirming that the story they told was true. You talk about witnesses sworn to tell the truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth. If a person's life was threatened because of that witness, and it was a lie, at least one them would've broken under the pressure. They would've confessed to the entire hoax. "He showed Himself alive after His passion by many infallible proofs."<br/>being seen of them for forty days, speaking to them of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God ( Act 1:3 ):<br/>Sometimes we fault the disciples because of their questions of the timing of the kingdom of God. Let it be remembered that the kingdom of God was the favorite subject of Jesus Christ. He was always talking about the kingdom of God, and it is a great hope that He was planting into the hearts of all men. Things are not always going to continue corrupted as they are. The world is not going to go forever under the power of darkness, under the bondage of evil. God is going to one day establish His kingdom upon the earth. A kingdom of righteous joy and peace. "Jesus shall reign, where ere the sun doth her successive journeys run. And His kingdom will extend from shore to shore." And that day will be the most glorious day the world has ever seen, as sickness and suffering and pain will be abolished in His kingdom. As sin and greed and these things that have made the world such an intolerable place will be abolished in His kingdom. The godless commercialism, the exploitation of man, all of these things abolished in His glorious kingdom when He reigns. No wonder the disciples were anxious to get it on. I'm anxious to get it on; I'm anxious for His kingdom to come. And Jesus told us when we pray, the first petition is, "Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven" ( Mat 6:10 ). This is the right kind of a desire that we should all have. I desire the kingdom of God. And so He was talking to them, during this forty-day period, of the kingdom.<br/>And, being assembled together with them, he commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which, saith he, you have heard of me ( Act 1:4 ).<br/>He said, "Now look, wait here in Jerusalem until you receive the promise of the Father." This promise that He is referring to is, no doubt, the promise in Joel where the Lord promised, "And it shall come to pass in the later days, saith the Lord, that I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and daughters will prophesy, and your young men shall dream dreams, your old men shall see visions: and upon my servants and my handmaidens shall I pour out my Spirit, saith the Lord" ( Joe 2:28-29 ). The promise of the Father: the day is going to come when God is going to pour out His Spirit upon all flesh, all of the believers. They will, each one, receive that dynamic from God.<br/>For John [He said,] truly baptized with water; but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now ( Act 1:5 ).<br/>The idea of baptism was that of emersion, the bapteedzo. John baptized with water, submerged the people in water, "you're going to be submerged in the Holy Spirit in not many days."<br/>Now when they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, will you at this time restore the kingdom to Israel? ( Act 1:6 )<br/>"When is it going to be, Lord? When's the time for this restoration?" And Jesus is talking to them now, not about the kingdom, but about the power that they're going to receive for service. And so He brushes aside their question.<br/>Saying unto them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father has put in his own power ( Act 1:7 ).<br/>"It's not for you to know." They lived constantly in the anticipation of the immediate setting up of the kingdom. During the entire lifetime of Jesus, they were expecting Him at any moment to go into the phone booth and come out as the savior of the world. Shazzam! Showing His power and overthrowing the governments of the world, establishing God's kingdom upon the earth. And they were waiting daily for this change to transpire. And whenever Jesus would talk about going to Jerusalem, being turned over into the hands of sinful man, and then being crucified, "Oh, oh no, Lord. No, no you don't understand the kingdom, Lord. Be that far from Thee." When Jesus died on the cross, they were all greatly disappointed.<br/>The two disciples on the road to Emmaus, so sad. "Hey, fellows. How come you're so sad as your walking along?" "What do you mean? You must be a stranger around here if you don't know the things that have been happening lately in Jerusalem." "What things?" "Oh, a fellow by the name of Jesus of Nazareth...oh man, it was mighty and powerful. The anointing of God was upon His life. We had hoped that in Him was the deliverance of Israel, but they crucified Him. We had hoped . . . now it's dead." Now He's risen, and He's saying, "In a few days, fellows, you're going to receive the promise of the Father." "Oh, what promise? The promise of the establishing of the kingdom?" You see, it was legitimate that they should ask. "Is this it Lord? Alright! Is this the time? Are you going to set up your kingdom now?" "No. It's not for you to know those times that the Father's appointed or that the Father has in His own power. But, you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you."<br/>Now here, the Greek preposition epi is used to signify a new relationship that they were to have with the Holy Spirit. In the Gospel According to John, chapter 14, as Jesus is there promising to send the Holy Spirit, He said, "I will not leave you comfortless. I will come to you, and I will pray the Father, and He will send to you another comforter, even the Spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth Him not neither knows Him, but you know Him for He dwells with you, and He shall be in you" ( Joh 14:17-18 ). Same Greek preposition as ours, only they spell it "en" instead of "in." Two-fold relationship there in John: He is with you, but He's going to be dwelling in you. But now Jesus said you're going to receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you. The Greek preposition epi, which is translated in different texts throughout the New Testament as "upon" or "over" or I like it, "overflows."<br/>In the seventh chapter of the gospel of John: "On the last day, the great day of the feast when Jesus stood there on the Temple Mount and cried to the people, 'If any man thirst let him come unto Me and drink: and he who drinks of the water that I give, out of his innermost being there will gush torrents of living water.'" John said, "This spake He of the Spirit, which was not yet given which they who believe on Him should receive" ( Joh 7:37-39 ). What did He speak of the Spirit? That it would be like a torrent of living water flowing out. I like, "When the Spirit overflows you," upon you, or over you, or overflows from you. So the three-fold relationship: He is with you prior to your conversion, He is the one who causes you to realize that you are a sinner, He is the one who points to Jesus Christ as the answer as He convinces the world of sin, of righteous, and of judgment. The moment you open your life and heart to Jesus Christ and invite Him to come in, the Holy Spirit comes and begins to indwell you. He shall be in you. "Know ye not that you are not your own, you have been bought with a price, therefore glorify God in your body and your spirit which are His. And know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit which is in you? Be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess, but be filled, or be ye being filled with the Spirit" ( 1Co 6:19-20 ,Eph 5:18 ). But now here's a third relationship. This is an empowering experience.<br/>You will receive [the dunamus] the dynamics, when the Holy Spirit has come [epi] upon you [or over you, or when there is that overflow from you]: and ye shall be witnesses unto me ( Act 1:8 )<br/>And so the dynamic, to be a witness for Jesus Christ. It is interesting that the word witness in Greek is the word martus from where we get our word martyr. And in Greek it does mean martyr. A witness is one who not only proclaims what he believes, he lives what he believes, he is what he believes, and he believes it so strongly, that if necessary, he'll die for what he believes. That's how strong is his belief. He's a martus. You can't stop him. He's not afraid to die for what he believes.<br/>You remember when Paul was on his way back to Jerusalem and Agabus came down from Caesarea and he took Paul's girdle and tied himself up and he said, "So is the man who owns this girdle to be bound when he gets to Jerusalem." And Paul's friends began to weep, saying, "Oh, Paul, don't go, don't go." And he said, "What do you mean by these tears? Do you think you're going to dissuade me? Do you think I'm worried about being bound? I'm ready to die." He was a martus. "I'm ready to die." Being put to death for your faith did not make you a martyr; because you were a martyr, you were put to death. Because you were a witness, because you believed it so strong. So, it did not make you a witness, it only proved what you were. You were a witness all along. If you hadn't been a martus, you would've never gone to your death. You would've recanted; you would've said, "Whoa, whoa, wait, wait. Hold on, let's change course here. I think that I may have made a mistake." Then you say, "Well, he wasn't a martus. Stealing a horse doesn't make you a horse thief; it only proves that you were. No one steals a horse unless he's a horse thief. So, stealing it doesn't make you a horse thief, it only proves that you were all along. Being martyred only proves what you were a witness, a martus. "And you will be witnesses." And isn't it interesting that most of them were martyred? "Witnesses unto Me."<br/>The witness was to be both in Jerusalem, and in all of Judea ( Act 1:8 ),<br/>The witness began right at home. The hardest place, isn't it? It's to start right at home in Jerusalem, and then the area around Jerusalem, the area of Judea. And then it was to spread up into Samaria. And then it was to go out into the uttermost parts of the world. And as we study the book of Acts, we will see this very progression. How the witness began in Jerusalem. We'll get that in the next chapter. And then we'll see how it began to spread through out Judea. And then Phillip went up into Samaria, and then finally Paul and Barnabas are called to go into the uttermost parts of the world. And so the witness spread through the anointing and the empowering of the Holy Spirit.<br/>Now when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight ( Act 1:9 ).<br/>This is the final promise made by Jesus to His disciples. This is it, the final words prior to His ascension. Of course, later He came and talked to Paul and others, but prior to His ascension, this is His final word. And upon this, when He had spoken these things, while they were watching Him, He was taken up and a cloud received Him out of their sight.<br/>And while they were looking steadfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, there were two men who stood by them in white apparel ( Act 1:10 );<br/>We assume they were angels.<br/>Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as you have seen him go into heaven ( Act 1:11 ).<br/>They saw Him as He ascended up into heaven and they will behold Him when He comes again. "Behold the Lord cometh with ten thousands of His saints, to execute judgement upon the earth" (Jud 1:14-15). And then, "Unto Him who loved us and gave Himself for us and who has made us unto our God, kings and priests who shall reign with Him upon the earth, behold the Lord cometh, and every eye shall see Him, and they also who pierced Him shall mourn" Rev 1:5-7 ). So the Lord's coming. Every eye shall see Him. The Jehovah Witnesses say that He is already come, but it was a secret coming. As it was only the disciples that saw Him go, it was only the disciples, of the Jehovah Witnesses, who saw Him return. But Jesus said, "If they say unto you, 'He has come in secret and has gone into a secret chamber don't believe it'" ( Mat 24:26 ). So you have to choose, to believe Jesus or them.<br/>"This same Jesus which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as you've seen Him go into heaven."<br/>Now there's a very interesting verse in II John, verse Act 1:7 , "For many deceivers are entered into the world who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh." That, unfortunately, is a poor translation of the Greek. For this participle is in the present tense and should be translated "is coming in the flesh." Those who would deny that Jesus Christ is coming in the flesh. What does John say of them? "They are a deceiver and an antichrist. Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward. For whosoever transgresses and abides not in the doctrine of Christ, has not God. He that abides in the doctrine of Christ, he has both the Father and the Son. And if there come any unto your door (on Saturday morning) and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, and neither bid him good-bye. For he that bids him good-bye is a partaker of his evil deeds" (2Jn 1:7-11). Ask them one question, "Is Jesus coming in the flesh?" Just ask them that question. And if they say no, just remember what John warned you and what John told you. "If any confess not that Jesus Christ is coming in the flesh." Do you remember when He was with the disciples and He said, "Give me something to eat"? He said, "You know, spirits don't eat; touch me. See? It's me." So, this same Jesus is coming again in the same manner in which they saw Him go into heaven. And I, for one, believe that that coming is very soon.<br/>Then retuned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a Sabbath's day journey [about two-thirds of a mile]. And when they were come in, they went up into an upper room, where there abode both Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, and Phillip, and Thomas, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon Zelotes, and Judas the brother of James. And these all continued in one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers ( Act 1:12-14 ).<br/>This is the last mention of Mary the mother of Jesus. At this point and from this point on, there is no further mention of her in the Acts of the Apostles or in the epistles. No mention of her death or of her miraculous ascension into heaven, without death. Nothing is mentioned in the scripture. It is silent.<br/>His brethren would be a reference probably to James and to Jude and to those other brothers who were sons of Joseph and Mary.<br/>The upper room--there are some who say that it is the same upper room in which Jesus had the Last Supper with His disciples. And yet, there are others who hold to this upper room being a room in the temple precincts where the early church met. Take your choice.<br/>And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples, and said, (the number of their names together were about one hundred and twenty,) men and brethren, this Scripture must needs have been fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit by the mouth of David spake before concerning Judas, which was a guide to those who took Jesus ( Act 1:15-16 ).<br/>Here again, Peter still his same impetuous self. They're waiting in prayer and supplication, and Peter stands up and says, "Fellows, there's a scripture that's gotta be fulfilled." And you know he's going to move ahead, "Let's get the program going; let's cast lots and find out who's going to take Judas' place." I do feel that Peter was again in the flesh, manifesting that impetuous nature that was his. And I think that the future history of the church in the book of Acts points this out. I am interested in Peter's understanding of the scriptures, how that he is quoting from so many places in the Old Testament. Peter does manifest a very great understanding of the Old Testament scriptures which is a point in his favor.<br/>Notice that Peter ascribes to the Holy Spirit those things that David wrote. So that, "All scripture is given by inspiration of God" ( 2Ti 3:16 ). Not part of the scriptures. Because, if you tell me that part of the scriptures are given by inspiration of God, then I must ask you, "What parts are by inspiration and what parts are not by inspiration?" And then you are then the authority who tells me what part I can believe and what part I can't believe. And the minute that God is no longer the authority but you're the authority, I'm in trouble. Beware of those who say, "Well, you can't believe all of the scriptures." The scriptures themselves say, "All scripture is given by inspiration of God." And here, Luke in writing of what Peter was saying, declares that David was actually the spokesman for the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit, by the mouth of David, spake concerning Judas.<br/>For he was numbered with us, [he was one of the twelve] he had obtained a part of this ministry. But now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity; and falling headlong ( Act 1:17-18 ),<br/>He purchased the field, the potter's field as Zachariah the eleventh chapter declares.<br/>and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all of his bowels gushed out ( Act 1:18 ).<br/>There are those who find a discrepancy in the scriptures, because in one of the gospels we are told that when Judas came back and tried to return the money, and they said, "Hey, it's your problem. We can't take it." And put it back in the temple treasury. "It's blood money." Then he threw it there on the floor of the temple and he went out and hung himself. Here Peter tells us that he fell headlong and just popped. And there are those who imagine a discrepancy. Very simple, he went up into the tree to hang himself, tied the rope around his neck and tied it to the limb and jumped. And the force of the fall either snapped the rope or his head, and he fell on down into the canyon and just as he said it here.<br/>It was known to all of the dwellers at Jerusalem; insomuch that the field is called in their tongue, Aceldama, that is to say, The field of blood. For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be desolate, and let no man dwell therein: and, His bishoprick let another take ( Act 1:19-20 ).<br/>Now in reality he's quoting from two different Psalms here. From Psa 69:25 ,he puts it together with Psa 109:8 . And putting the two together he finds these prophecies concerning Judas.<br/>Wherefore of these men ( Act 1:21 )<br/>Now here is where they are looking for someone to take Judas' place to be an apostle. Here are the qualifications they looked for in that time.<br/>Wherefore of these men which have companied with us all the time that the Lord Jesus when in and out among us ( Act 1:21 ),<br/>Now you remember there were many disciples, many disciples of which Jesus chose ten to be apostles. And the word apostle means "one who is sent out." Or chose twelve to be apostles, so He sent out the twelve. The number of human government. "We only have eleven. We need one to take Judas' place, but we need one who has been with us all the while from the beginning with Jesus."<br/>From the time he was baptized by John, until the day he was taken up from us, must one be ordained to be a witness [of what?] of His resurrection ( Act 1:22 ).<br/>So these were the requirements they were looking for. Someone who had been around the whole while. From the time of John's baptism to the ascension. And one who saw the risen Lord, and thus could bear fact of the resurrection, their testimony to the fact.<br/>Now Paul the apostle, later in asserting the fact that he was an apostle said, "Have I not seen the risen Christ?" Evidently that was one of the requirements of apostleship. Someone asked me, "Are there apostles today?" Well, I don't know. I don't think that there are in the same sense that they were in the New Testament. Surely there is none today who can bear witness to the resurrection as they did.<br/>They appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias. And they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord, which knowest the hearts of all men, show whether of these two that you have chosen ( Act 1:23-24 ),<br/>I think that we often make this mistake of giving the Lord two choices, both wrong. Limiting God, you see. We're so prone to do this. Obviously, Paul was God's choice. Peter was impetuous, and jumping the gun said, "Hey, we've got to do something, you know, gotta help God out. You know, one's missing and we've got to fill him in." And yet, "God, which one of these two do you want?" And giving God the two choices.<br/>That he may take part of this ministry and this apostleship, from which Judas by the transgression fell, that he might go to his own place. And so they gave forth their lots ( Act 1:25-26 );<br/>An interesting way by which they sought to determine the will of God. Let's throw dice, find out what God's will is here. It's interesting to me, the various ways that people have devised to discern the will of God. Now, in the Old Testament times they had an interesting way of coming to the priest, who would inquire of the Lord for them through the Urim and the Thummim, the "lights and perfections." Just what these Urim and Thummim were, we don't know. I'm sure they were not the colored glasses that Joseph Smith found with the Golden Tablets; the magic glasses, that when you put them on, you could suddenly read the hieroglyphic writing.<br/>There are those who say that the Urim and Thummim were actually a black and a white stone that was worn in a pouch on the chest of the priest. They would pray and ask the Lord a particular question. You remember that David was asking the Lord definite questions: "Lord, shall we go out against the Philistines?" The answer was, "No." So again, the next day, "Lord, shall we go out against the Philistines?" The answer was, "Yes." "When shall we go?" They would ask specific questions, and the Lord would direct them through the Urim and the Thummin. They say that the priest would pray, seek God, and then reach in and pull out one of the two stones. If it was the white stone, it was a yes answer. If it was a no, then it would be the black stone that he would pull out. Some even say we get the term blackballed from this Urim and Thummim. Actually, back in the original it is a no vote against a particular project or idea. Just what the Urim and Thummim were, we don't know. But during the Old Testament period, they did use a method of casting lots to determine the will of God.<br/>So here the disciples are picking up on the same thing as they are throwing the dice to see which of the two fellows that God had chosen to replace Judas Iscariot.<br/>the lot fell on Matthias; he was numbered with the eleven ( Act 1:26 ).<br/>Now who in the world is Matthias? No one ever heard of him before or since. It'll be interesting to meet Matthias and find out who he is and what he did. I think from the subsequent history, it's obvious to assume that God chose Paul as an apostle. Paul declares it himself. Now this is the last time we ever read of them seeking to discern the will of God by the casting of lots or by a chance kind of a thing.<br/>I know a fellow today, in seeking to discern the will of the Lord, will pray and ask the Lord a question. He'll have ten pennies in his pocket, and as he's praying, he'll take the pennies with his eyes closed and put them down on the table, and if they all come up heads, it's a yes. An interesting thing, every once in a while, they'll all come up heads, and that's pretty good odds. Yet, we don't find any pattern for this after the Holy Spirit was given. Once the Holy Spirit came upon the church, then the Holy Spirit began to speak to them and direct them. And the Holy Spirit said, "Separate unto me Paul and Barnabas for the ministry where I have called them" ( Act 13:2 ). And the Holy Spirit sent them forth. So we find the church more directly guided by the Holy Spirit. Once the Holy Spirit came, this throwing dice to find out the will of God was set aside.<br/>"<br/><br/>King James Version<br/><br/>This is the 1769 King James Version of the Holy Bible (also known as the Authorized Version). "Public Domain" | Smith Chuck - Kroz Bibliju C2000 SeriesShall okrećemo se knjizi Djela apostolska, prvom poglavlju, dok počinjemo proučavati ranu crkvu.<br/>Luka, autor knjige Djela apostolska, suputnik Pavla apostola, koji je također bio autor Evanđelja Prema Luki, napisao je ove dvije rasprave prijatelju Teofilu. Neki vjeruju da to uopće nije bio čovjek, nego da su evanđelje i knjiga Djela apostolska upućeni ljubavnicima Božjim, tko god da ste. Postoje i druge tradicije koje govore da je Teofil bio Lukeov gospodar, da su u to vrijeme liječnici bili robovi, obično rob bogatog zaštitnika. Lukeov gospodar bio je Teofil i oslobodio je Lukea da bude s Pavlom na misionarskim putovanjima. - Ovo je rana tradicija crkve, ali je, naravno, nemoguće dokazati, kao i mnoge od tih tradicija.<br/>Ima i onih koji vjeruju da kad je Pavao bio u Troi i kad je dobio viziju čovjeka koji ga je dozivao govoreći: - Dođite u Makedoniju i pomozite nam - da je taj čovjek u Pavlovoj viziji bio nitko drugi do Luka. Prvi kojeg je Pavao zaista upoznao kad je došao u Makedoniju bio je Luka, a kao što smo mi u Djelima apostolskim, naći ćete da kada dođemo do tog dijela knjige Djela apostolska, Luka počinje pisati više u prvom licu nego u trećem. U Djelima apostolskim Luka je postao Pavlov pratilac i počeo putovati s njim. Ovo je, bez sumnje, mjesto gdje je Luke postao sudionik i očevidac onih stvari koje su se događale od sada pa nadalje.<br/>Započinje Djela apostolska povezujući ga s Evanđeljem prema Luki. Zanimljivo je da je zadnja stvar koju Luka bilježi u svom evanđelju prva stvar koju bilježi u Djelima apostolskim. Nalazimo da se Lukino evanđelje zatvara dok Isus govori svojim učenicima da čekaju u Jeruzalemu dok se ne ugađaju moći s visine, a onda je Isus uzašao na nebo i zatvorio evanđelje, otvarajući Djela apostolska piše:<br/>Prethodna rasprava (to jest Evanđelje prema Luki) jesam li ti napisao, Teofile, o svemu što je Isus počeo raditi i poučavati (Akt 1:1),<br/>Evanđelje prema Luki nije cijela priča o službi Isusa Krista, već samo početak službe Isusa Krista, Isus nastavlja služiti potrebama ljudi, Isus nastavlja liječiti bolesne. Isus nastavlja da uskrisi mrtve, Isus nastavlja da služi svojoj ljubavi i evanđelju svetu, tek sada služi preko onih učenika koji su pomazani Njegovim Duhom Svetim. U osnovi, to je pretpostavka koju Luka uzima u Djelima apostolskim, nekadašnja rasprava o svemu što je Isus započeo, kako da čini tako i da uči.<br/>Zbog toga su Djela apostolska nedovršena knjiga: u tome što Gospodin danas nastavlja raditi kroz živote onih koji su se posvetili da budu instrumenti Božji. Da bude vođen i vođen i pomazan od Njegovog Duha Svetog, da nastavi službu Isusovu u današnjem svijetu. Bog može koristiti anđeoska bića za svoje djelo, i doći će vrijeme, tijekom knjige Otkrivenja kada će Bog koristiti anđele da naviještaju svoje evanđelje ljudima diljem svijeta. Otkrivenje, 14. poglavlje, prvi anđeo koji leti posred neba i ima vječno evanđelje, ali u ovom trenutku, Bog je izabrao da koristi ljudske instrumente, koliko god oni bili nesavršeni, ali to je ono što je Bog odredio da koristi. Uzbudljiva stvar u vezi toga je, Bog će me iskoristiti i Bog će te iskoristiti. Jeremiah je rekao: \"Gospodaru, ja sam samo dijete, nitko me neće slušati, a svi imamo svoje isprike zašto nas ne mogu iskoristiti, zar ne?<br/>Jednom, dok je Gospod pozivao proroka da obavi svoj posao, rekao je, \"Gospode, pošalji koga god želiš\" Gospod je rekao, \"Hej, zvao sam te, Gospode, dobra ideja, pošalji koga god želiš.\" Tako često smo u tom položaju, Gospode, pošalji rukom koga hoćeš, bilo koga osim mene Gospode, a ipak, Bog je odredio da nas iskoristi.<br/>Svako od nas može pokazati svoju nesavršenost, svako od nas može ukazati na svoje nesposobnosti, i svi mi možemo naći izgovor zašto Bog ne bi želeo da me iskoristi, ali ipak, Bog je izabrao da iskoristi tebe. Pitaš se kada Bog ima takve instrumente da koristi kako je obavio posao, zar ne?<br/>Do dana u kojem je bio odveden, nakon što je preko Duha Svetoga dao zapovijedi apostolima koje je izabrao (Akt 1:2):<br/>S tim je završio Evanđelje po Luki, na dan kad je Isus odveden, nakon što je apostolima rekao da čekaju davanje moći.<br/>Njima se pokazao živ nakon svoje strasti [ili smrti] mnogim nepogrešivim dokazima (Akt 1:3 ),<br/>Bio sam zabavljen, kao i iznerviran i iritiran, člankom koji sam pročitao u registru Santa Ana prošle subote. Kako je jedan profesor rekao da predaje nauku, i tako se bave samo činjenicama, i da nemaju mjesta za teorije. Znanost se temelji na činjenicama, a stvaranje se temelji na religijskim praznovjerjima, potrebno je puno vjere da bi se vjerovalo religijskim teorijama, a kada se bavite činjenicama, možete ih jednostavno prihvatiti. Mislio sam da su me na tom času nauke učili da je svet star 4 milijarde godina, a danas uče da je svet star 12 milijardi godina. ♪ I to nije bilo tako davno da sam otišao u školu ♪<br/>Zanimljivo je da Biblija nikada nije trebala biti revidirana ili ažurirana kako bi se zadovoljili trenutni podaci koje su ljudi otkrili. Pa ipak, ako biste danas uzeli moje udžbenike za nauku iz srednje škole i pokušali od njih podučavati nauku, otkrili biste da mnoge stvari koje su bile naučene kao znanstvene činjenice kada sam bio u srednjoj školi više nisu priznate kao znanstvene činjenice. Protoplazma jednostavnih stanica više nije jednostavna stanica, nego izuzetno složena, ako postoji ikakva činjenica koja se može potvrditi u povijesti, to je činjenica uskrsnuća Isusa Krista iz mrtvih.<br/>- Imamo pravosudni sustav koji se temelji na svjedočenju svjedoka. - Ako je čovjek optužen za zločin i ima ljudi koji su svjedočili tom zločinu dok je bio počinjen, i dovedeni su do standarda, i zaklinju se da će govoriti istinu, cijelu istinu, i ništa osim istine, tako im Bog pomogao. Vidjela sam kako je izvukao pištolj iz kaputa i tražila da mu daju sav novac, vidjela sam ga kad je odlazio iz banke. Vidio sam ga dok ga je policajac hapsio vani i ako možete dobiti tri ili četiri svjedoka da ukažu na tog čovjeka i da će njihovo svjedočenje držati pod unakrsnim ispitivanjem, tom čovjeku se sudi da je kriv. Imamo dva ili tri svjedoka koji svjedoče istu priču o tom čovjeku, i prihvaćeno je kao činjenica da je on počinio zločin i da je kriv.<br/>Nakon Isusove smrti, kad je opet ustao, ukazao se mnogim različitim ljudima koji su svjedočili zakletvom da su ga vidjeli, da su razgovarali s Njim, da im se ukazao na raznim mjestima pod različitim okolnostima. I u jednom trenutku, do čak pet stotina ljudi koji su bili okupljeni na jednom mjestu, pojavio se, teško je samo odbaciti ili poreći svjedoke tih ljudi. To znači diskreditirati cijeli naš pravosudni sustav. Ali ne samo to, ti ljudi koji su posvjedočili da su vidjeli uskrslog Gospodina, da su razgovarali s Njim, da su jeli s Njim, oni, svi oni, osim jednog, susreli su nasilne smrti od ruku drugih ljudi zbog njihove potvrde da je priča koju su ispričali istinita. Govorite o svjedocima koji su se zakleli da će govoriti istinu, samo istinu, samo istinu. Pokazao se živ nakon svoje strasti mnogim nepogrešivim dokazima<br/>da ih se vidi četrdeset dana, govoreći im o stvarima koje se odnose na kraljevstvo Božje (Akt 1:3):<br/>Ponekad krivimo učenike zbog njihovih pitanja o vremenu vremena kraljevstva Božjega. On je uvijek govorio o kraljevstvu Božjem, i velika je nada da je usađivao u srca svih ljudi. Svijet neće zauvijek biti pod silom tame, pod ropstvom zla, Bog će jednoga dana uspostaviti svoje kraljevstvo na zemlji, kraljevstvo pravedne radosti i mira. Isus će zavladati prije nego što sunce nastavi putovati, a njegovo kraljevstvo će se protezati od obale do obale. I taj dan će biti najslavniji dan koji je svijet ikada vidio, jer će bolest i patnja i bol biti ukinuti u Njegovom kraljevstvu, kao grijeh i pohlepa i te stvari koje su učinile svijet tako nepodnošljivim mjestom bit će ukinute u Njegovom kraljevstvu. Nije ni čudo što su učenici jedva čekali da se to ostvari, a ja sam nestrpljiva da se to ostvari; ja sam nestrpljiva da njegovo kraljevstvo dođe. Isus nam je rekao kad se molimo, prva molba je: \"Dođi kraljevstvo tvoje, budi volja tvoja na zemlji, kao što je na nebu, to je prava želja koju svi trebamo imati, želim kraljevstvo Božje. I tako je razgovarao sa njima, tokom tog četrdesetodnevnog perioda, o kraljevstvu.<br/>I sastavši se s njima, zapovjedio im je da ne odlaze iz Jeruzalema, nego da čekaju obećanje Oca, koje ste, kaže on, čuli za mene (Akt 1:4).<br/>Rekao je: - Slušaj, čekaj ovdje u Jeruzalemu dok ne primiš obećanje Oca. Ovo obećanje na koje on misli je, bez sumnje, obećanje u Joelu gdje je Gospodin obećao, i to će se dogoditi u kasnijim danima, govori Gospodin, da ću izliti svoj Duh na svako tijelo; i vaši sinovi i kćeri proricat će, i vaši će mladići sanjati snove, vaši će starci vidjeti vizije; i na moje sluge i moje sluškinje izliti ću svoj Duh, kaže Gospodin - (Joe 2:28-29). Obećanje Oca: doći će dan kada će Bog izliti svoj Duh na svako tijelo, na sve vjernike, oni će, svaki, primiti tu dinamiku od Boga.<br/>Za Ivana [on je rekao] istinski krštenog vodom; ali vi ćete biti kršteni Duhom Svetim ne mnogo dana od sada (Akt 1:5 ).<br/>Ivan kršten vodom, potopljen narod u vodi, bit ćete potopljeni u Duhu Svetom za nekoliko dana.<br/>Kada su se sada okupili, pitali su ga: \"Gospodaru, hoćeš li u ovom trenutku vratiti kraljevstvo Izraelu?\" (Akt 1:6)<br/>Isus sada razgovara s njima, ne o kraljevstvu, nego o moći koju će primiti za službu, i tako pobija njihovo pitanje.<br/>- Govoreći im: Nije na vama da znate vrijeme ili godišnja doba, koje je Otac stavio u vlastitu vlast (Akt 1:7 ).<br/>Nije na vama da znate, stalno su živjeli u iščekivanju neposrednog postavljanja kraljevstva, tijekom cijelog Isusovog života očekivali su da će svakog trenutka ući u telefonsku govornicu i izaći kao spasitelj svijeta. Pokazuje svoju moć i svrgava vlade svijeta, uspostavlja Božje kraljevstvo na zemlji i oni su svakodnevno čekali da se ta promjena ostvari. I kad god bi Isus govorio o odlasku u Jeruzalem, da ga pretvore u ruke grešnog čovjeka, a onda bi ga razapeli, o, ne, Gospodine. Kada je Isus umro na križu, svi su bili jako razočarani.<br/>Dva učenika na putu za Emaus, tako tužno. Nadali smo se da je u njemu izbavljenje Izraela, ali su ga razapeli, nadali smo se da je sada mrtav. On je uskrsnuo i kaže: Za nekoliko dana, momci, primit ćete obećanje Oca. Hoćeš li sada uspostaviti svoje kraljevstvo, nije na tebi da znaš vrijeme koje je Otac odredio ili da Otac ima u svojoj vlasti, ali primit ćeš moć kad Sveti Duh dođe na tebe.<br/>- Ovdje, grčki epi za prijedlog se koristi za označavanje novog odnosa koji su trebali imati s Duhom Svetim. U Evanđelju po Ivanu, 14. poglavlje, kao što Isus obećava da će poslati Duha Svetoga, rekao je: \"Neću vas ostaviti bez utjehe.\" Doći ću k vama i molit ću se Ocu, i On će vam poslati drugog tješitelja, čak i Duha Istine kojeg svijet ne može primiti jer ga ne vidi niti ga poznaje, nego ga poznajete jer On živi s vama, i on će biti u vama. ( Joh 14,17-18 ) Ali sada je Isus rekao da ćete dobiti moć kad Duh Sveti dođe na vas. Grčki epi za prijedlog, koji se u različitim tekstovima u cijelom Novom zavjetu prevodi kao \"upon\" ili \"over\" ili \"over\" ili \"overflows\"<br/>U sedmom poglavlju Ivanovog evanđelja: - Posljednjeg dana, velikog dana blagdana kada je Isus stajao na Hramskoj gori i vikao narodu: 'Ako ga tko bude žedan pusti da dođe k meni i pije; i tko pije vodu koju ja dajem, iz svog najdubljeg bića izbit će bujice žive vode.' Ivan je rekao: \"Ovo je rekao On od Duha, koji još nije dobio ono što bi oni koji vjeruju u Njega trebali primiti.\" (Joh 7:37-39 ) Što je govorio o Duhu? Da će to biti kao bujica žive vode koja teče. Volim, kada te Duh preplavi, nad tobom, nad tobom, ili nad tobom, ili se prelijeva od tebe. On je s vama prije vašeg obraćenja, on je taj koji vas navodi da shvatite da ste grješnik, On je taj koji ukazuje na Isusa Krista kao na odgovor dok uvjerava svijet grijeha, pravednosti i suda. U trenutku kada otvorite svoj život i srce Isusu Kristu i pozovete ga da uđe, Duh Sveti dolazi i počinje vas udovoljavati. Zar ne znate da niste svoji, da ste kupljeni sa cenom, zato slavite Boga u svom telu i svom duhu koji je Njegov, i ne znate da je vaše telo hram Duha Svetoga koji je u vama? Nemojte se opijati vinom, u kojem je višak, nego se napunite, ili budite ispunjeni Duhom, (1Co 6:19-20,Ef 5:18 ) ali sada je ovo treći odnos, ovo je osnažujuće iskustvo.<br/>Primit ćete dinamiku, kad dođe Duh Sveti [epi] na vas [ili nad vama, ili kad bude prelijevanja od vas]; i bit ćete mi svjedoci (Akt 1:8)<br/>Zanimljivo je da je riječ svjedok na grčkom riječ martus odakle dobivamo riječ mučenik, a na grčkom znači mučenik. Svedok je onaj koji ne samo da proglašava ono u šta veruje, živi ono u šta veruje, on je ono u šta veruje, i veruje u to tako snažno, da ako bude potrebno, umreće za ono u šta veruje. Ne boji se umrijeti za ono u što vjeruje.<br/>Sjećaš se kad je Pavao bio na putu natrag u Jeruzalem i Agabus je sišao iz Cezareje i uzeo Pavlov pojas i vezao se i rekao: \"Kao i čovjek koji posjeduje ovaj steznik da bude vezan kad stigne u Jeruzalem?\" Paulovi prijatelji počeli su plakati i govoriti: \"Paule, nemoj ići, nemoj ići\", a on je rekao: \"Što misliš pod tim suzama?\" Misliš li da ćeš me odvratiti? Zato što si bio mučenik, bio si pogubljen, jer si bio svjedok, jer si vjerovao da si tako jak. Da nisi bio Martus, nikad ne bi otišao u smrt, porekao bi, rekao bi: Mislim da sam pogriješio, a ti kažeš da nije bio martus, krađa konja te ne čini kradljivcem konja, to samo dokazuje da jesi, nitko ne krade konja osim ako nije konjokradica. Krađa te ne čini kradljivcem konja, samo dokazuje da si cijelo vrijeme bio mučenik samo dokazuje ono što si bio svjedok, martus.<br/>Svedok je trebalo da bude i u Jerusalimu, i u celoj Judeji (Akt 1:8 ),<br/>Svedok je počeo kod kuće, na najtežem mestu, zar ne? I dok budemo proučavali knjigu Djela apostolska, vidjet ćemo kako je svjedok počeo u Jeruzalemu, a to ćemo dobiti u sljedećem poglavlju. Onda ćemo vidjeti kako se počela širiti Judejom, a onda je Phillip otišao u Samariju, i na kraju su Paul i Barnaba pozvani da odu u krajeve svijeta. I tako se svjedok proširio kroz pomazanje i osnaživanje Duha Svetoga.<br/>Kada je to rekao, dok su oni gledali, on je bio odveden, i oblak ga je primio iz njihovih očiju (Akt 1:9).<br/>Ovo je konačno obećanje koje je Isus dao svojim učenicima, to je to, posljednje riječi prije njegovog uzašašća, naravno, kasnije je došao i razgovarao s Pavlom i drugima, ali prije njegovog uzašašća, ovo je njegova posljednja riječ. I na to, kad je govorio te stvari, dok su ga promatrali, bio je odveden i oblak ga je primao iz njihovih očiju.<br/>I dok su oni uporno gledali prema nebu dok je on izlazio, gle, dva čovjeka su stajala uz njih u bijeloj odjeći (Akt 1:10 );<br/>- Pretpostavljamo da su bili anđeli.<br/>Što je također reklo: \"Vi Galilejski ljudi, zašto stojite i gledate u nebo?\" Ovaj isti Isus, koji je uzet od vas na nebo, doći će na isti način kao što ste ga vidjeli da odlazi na nebo (Akt 1:11).<br/>Vidjeli su ga kako se uspinje na nebo i vidjet će ga kad opet dođe. (Gle Gospodin dolazi s deset tisuća svojih svetaca, da izvrši presudu na zemlji) (Jud 1:14-15). I onda, -Onom koji nas je volio i dao nam se i koji nas je učinio našim Bogom, kraljevima i svećenicima koji će kraljevati s Njim na zemlji, evo Gospodina kako dolazi, i svako oko će ga vidjeti, i oni koji su ga proboli također će tugovati - Otk 1:5-7 ). Svedoci kažu da je on već došao, ali to je bila tajna koja je dolazila, jer su ga samo učenici videli kako odlazi, samo su učenici, Jehovini svedoci, videli kako se vraća. Ali Isus je rekao: ako vam kažu: 'Došao je u tajnosti i otišao u tajnu odaju, ne vjerujte u to' (Mat 24,26 ) Tako da morate izabrati, vjerovati Isusu ili njima.<br/>Taj isti Isus koji je odveden od vas na nebo, doći će na isti način kao što ste ga vidjeli da odlazi na nebo.<br/>Postoji vrlo zanimljiv stih u II Ivanu, stih Akt 1:7 , Za mnoge varalice su ušli u svijet koji ne priznaju da je Isus Krist došao u tijelu . To je, nažalost, loš prijevod Grka. Jer ovaj particip je u sadašnjem vremenu i treba ga prevesti - dolazi u tijelu - oni koji bi zanijekali da Isus Krist dolazi u tijelu. Pogledajte sami sebe, da ne gubimo ono što smo napravili, nego da primamo punu nagradu, jer tko prevrši i ne ostane u Kristovoj doktrini, nema Boga. Tko ostane u Kristovoj doktrini, ima i Oca i Sina, i ako netko dođe na vaša vrata (u subotu ujutro) i ne donese ovu doktrinu, ne primite ga u svoju kuću i ne pozdravite se s njim. Jer onaj koji ga pozdravlja je sudionik njegovih zlih djela, (2Jn 1:7-11) Postavi im jedno pitanje, da li Isus dolazi tijelom, samo ih pitaj to pitanje, a ako kažu ne, sjeti se samo što ti je John upozorio i što ti je John rekao. Ako netko ne prizna da Isus Krist dolazi tijelom, sjećaš li se kad je bio s učenicima i rekao: \"Daj mi nešto za jelo\", rekao je, \"Znaš, duhovi ne jedu, dodirni me.\" Dakle, taj isti Isus opet dolazi na isti način na koji su ga vidjeli kako odlazi na nebo, a ja vjerujem da je to vrlo brzo.<br/>Onda su se vratili u Jeruzalem s planine zvane Olivet, koja je od Jeruzalema sabatno putovanje [oko dvije trećine milje]. Kada su ušli, otišli su u gornju sobu, gdje su boravili i Petar, Jakov, Ivan, Andrija, Filip, Toma, Bartolomej, Matej, Jakov, sin Alfejev, Simon Zelotes i Juda, brat Jakovljev. I sve se to nastavilo u jednom skladu u molitvi i preklinjanju, sa ženama, i Marijom, majkom Isusovom, i njegovom braćom (Akt 1:12-14 ).<br/>Ovo je posljednji spomen o Mariji, majci Isusovoj, u ovom trenutku i od ovog trenutka, više je se ne spominje u Djelima apostolskim ili u poslanicama, niti o njenoj smrti ili o njenom čudesnom uzašašću na nebo, bez smrti. - Ništa se ne spominje u Pismu.<br/>Njegova braća bi bila referenca vjerojatno na Jamesa i Judu i onu drugu braću koja su bila sinovi Josipa i Marije.<br/>Neki kažu da je to ista gornja soba u kojoj je Isus imao posljednju večeru sa svojim učenicima, a ipak, ima i drugih koji drže ovu gornju sobu kao sobu u hramskim stanicama u kojoj se sastala rana crkva. -Izaberi.<br/>U to vrijeme Petar je ustao usred učenika i rekao: (broj njihovih imena zajedno bio je oko sto dvadeset,) ljudi i braća, ovo pismo mora biti ispunjeno, što je Duh Sveti po ustima Davidovim govorio prije u vezi Jude, koji je bio vodič onima koji su uzeli Isusa (Akt 1:15-16).<br/>Oni čekaju u molitvi i preklinjanju, a Petar ustane i kaže: I znaš da će krenuti naprijed, - Pokrenimo program, bacimo žrebove i saznajmo tko će zauzeti Judino mjesto - osjećam da je Petar opet bio u tijelu, pokazujući tu naglu prirodu koja je bila njegova. Mislim da buduća povijest crkve u knjizi Djela apostolska ukazuje na to, zanima me Petrovo razumijevanje biblijskih redaka, kako citira iz toliko mjesta u Starom zavjetu. Peter pokazuje vrlo veliko razumijevanje starozavjetnih spisa što je poanta u njegovu korist.<br/>Zapazite da Petar Duhu Svetom pripisuje ono što je David napisao, tako da se sve Pismo daje Božjim nadahnućem ( 2Ti 3:16 ). Jer, ako mi kažete da je dio spisa dat Božjim nadahnućem, onda vas moram pitati, koji su dijelovi po nadahnuću, a koji dijelovi nisu po nadahnuću. I onda si ti autoritet koji mi govori u koji deo mogu da verujem i u koji deo ne mogu da verujem, i minut kada Bog više nije autoritet, ali ti si autoritet, ja sam u nevolji. \"Čuvajte se onih koji kažu, \"Pa, ne možete vjerovati svim biblijskim citatima.\" Sami spisi kažu: \"Sve je Pismo dano nadahnućem Boga.\" Luke je u pisanom obliku rekao da je David bio glasnogovornik Duha Svetoga.<br/>Bio je izbrojan kod nas, bio je jedan od dvanaestorice, dobio je dio ove službe, ali sada je ovaj čovjek kupio polje s nagradom bezakonja, i pao je naglavačke (Akt 1:17-18),<br/>On je kupio polje, polje lončarevo kao što objavljuje Zachariah jedanaesto poglavlje.<br/>Padao je naglavačke, rasprsnuo se u sredini, i sva su mu crijeva isparila (Akt 1:18).<br/>Postoje oni koji nađu neslaganje u spisima, jer u jednom od evanđelja nam je rečeno da kada se Juda vratio i pokušao vratiti novac, rekli su: \"Hej, to je tvoj problem, ne možemo ga uzeti.\" I vratiti ga u riznicu hrama. -To je krvavi novac, onda ga je bacio na pod hrama i izašao i objesio se. Vrlo jednostavno, popeo se na drvo da se objesi, vezao uže oko vrata i vezao ga za ud i skočio.<br/>Svim stanovnicima Jeruzalema bilo je poznato da se polje zove na njihovom jeziku, Aceldama, to jest Polje krvi. - Jer je zapisano u Psalmskoj knjizi, neka njegovo prebivalište bude opustošeno, i neka nitko ne stanuje u njemu; i, Njegov biskupik neka drugi uzme (Akt 1:19-20 ).<br/>Iz Pse 69:25 slaže se sa Psom 109:8 i sastavlja ova proročanstva koja se tiču Jude.<br/>- Zbog čega od tih ljudi (Akt 1:21 )<br/>Ovdje traže nekoga da zauzme Judino mjesto apostola.<br/>- Zbog čega su od ovih ljudi koji su se družili s nama svo vrijeme koje je Gospodin Isus kad uđe i izađe među nas (Akt 1:21 ),<br/>Imali ste mnogo učenika, od kojih je Isus izabrao deset apostola, a riječ apostol znači onaj koji je poslan, ili je izabrao dvanaest apostola, pa je poslao dvanaestoricu, broj ljudske vlasti. Treba nam jedan da zauzmemo Judino mjesto, ali nam treba onaj koji je od početka bio s nama od Isusa.<br/>Od trenutka kad ga je Ivan krstio, pa sve do dana kada je odveden od nas, mora li se netko zarediti da bude svjedokom [čega?] njegovog uskrsnuća (Akt 1:22 ).<br/>To su bili zahtjevi koje su tražili, netko tko je cijelo vrijeme bio u blizini, od vremena Johnovog krštenja do uzašašća, i onaj koji je vidio uskrslog Gospodina, i tako mogao podnijeti činjenicu uskrsnuća, njihovo svjedočenje o činjenici.<br/>Pavao apostol, koji je kasnije tvrdio da je apostol, rekao je: \"Zar nisam vidio uskrslog Krista, očito je to bio jedan od zahtjeva apostolstva. Ne mislim da postoje u istom smislu da su bili u Novom zavjetu, ali danas sigurno ne postoji nitko tko može svjedočiti o uskrsnuću kao oni.<br/>Postavili su dvojicu, Josipa zvanog Barsabas, koji se prezivao Justus i Matthias, i molili su se i rekli: \"Ti, Gospode, koji poznaješ srca svih ljudi, pokaži da li od njih dvojice koje si izabrao (Akt 1:23-24),<br/>Pavle je očito bio Božji izbor. Peter je bio nagao, i preskakanje pištolja je rekao, \"Hej, moramo nešto učiniti, znaš, moramo pomoći Bogu, jedan nedostaje, a mi ga moramo ispuniti, a ipak, Bože, kojeg od ove dvojice želiš, i dati Bogu dva izbora.<br/>da uzme dio ove službe i ovo apostolstvo, iz kojeg je Juda pao zbog prijestupa, da bi mogao otići na svoje mjesto.<br/>Bacimo kockice, saznajmo koja je Božja volja ovdje, zanimljivi su mi razni načini na koje su ljudi smislili da razaberu Božju volju. U starozavjetna vremena imali su zanimljiv način dolaska svećeniku, koji bi se raspitivao o Gospodinu za njih kroz Urim i Thumim, svjetla i savršenstva, baš ono što su ti Urim i Thumim bili, ne znamo. - Siguran sam da to nisu bile obojene naočale koje je Joseph Smith pronašao sa zlatnim tabletama; čarobne naočale, da kada ih stavite, možete iznenada pročitati hijeroglifsko pisanje.<br/>Ima onih koji kažu da su Urim i Thumim zapravo bili crni i bijeli kamen koji se nosio u vrećici na svećenikovim prsima. Sjećaš li se da je David postavljao Gospodinu određena pitanja: Gospode, hoćemo li izaći protiv Filistejaca? Odgovor je bio: - Ne. Dakle, sutradan ćemo izaći protiv Filistejaca. Odgovor je bio: - Da. Oni bi postavljali konkretna pitanja, a Gospod bi ih usmjeravao preko Urima i Thummina, kažu da bi se svećenik molio, tražio Boga, a zatim posegnuo i izvukao jedno od dva kamena. Neki čak kažu da smo dobili izraz blackballed iz ovog Urim i Thummim. zapravo, natrag u originalu to je nema glasa protiv određenog projekta ili ideje. Ne znamo kakvi su bili Urimi i Thummimi, ali u starozavjetnom razdoblju, koristili su metodu bacanja punova kako bi odredili Božju volju.<br/>Dakle, ovdje učenici skupljaju istu stvar kao što bacaju kockice da vide koji od dvojice momaka koje je Bog izabrao da zamijene Judu Iskariota.<br/>- gomila je pala na Matijasa; on je bio numerisan sa jedanaest (Akt 1:26 ).<br/>Nitko nije čuo za njega prije ili poslije, bit će zanimljivo upoznati Matthiasa i saznati tko je on i što je učinio. Ovo je posljednji put da smo pročitali da žele razabrati Božju volju bacanjem lota ili nekim slučajem.<br/>Znam jednog momka danas, koji želi razabrati volju Gospodnju, molit će se i postaviti Gospodinu pitanje. - Imaće deset penija u džepu, i dok se moli, uzeće penije zatvorenih očiju i staviti ih na sto, i ako svi dođu gore glave, to je da. -Zanimljiva stvar, s vremena na vrijeme, svi će doći glave, a to su prilično dobre šanse, ali ipak, ne nalazimo nikakav obrazac za to nakon što je Duh Sveti dat. Kada je Duh Sveti došao na crkvu, onda im je Duh Sveti počeo govoriti i usmjeravati ih.

Yes that is correct, the Urbanears don't have a built in noise cancelling mic on the headphone itself but from what I can see there is a mic on the cable provided.<br/>1. Well the mic is usually placed where it can have a connection to the PCB which are within the headphones so if you mean that the mic shouldn't be on the headphone itself, that (from my experience) is incorrect.<br/>2. Most noise cancelling headphones use the built in mic for the DSP (the noise cancelling) and to make calls so the signal from the mic needs to be able to be sent to the phone too.<br/>3. I'm not quite sure what you mean by this ...<br/><br/>Click to expand...<br/><br/>But you are correct that a headphone driver can work as a "low quality" mic. In fact, dynamic drivers work exactly the same as dynamic microphones but in reverse. Inside a dynamic driver there is a magnet, and when you plug in the headphones, you are sending a AC current through it which will turn the voice coil into a magnet. Depending on the direction of the current, the polarity of the magnet will change. Now since we know for a magnet, same charges repels and different charges attract, we know that the voice coil will move back and forth depending on it's polarity at the time. The voice coil is attached to the diaphragm which will then move back and forth creating a sound wave. The same occurs in reverse, if you move a coil through a magnet you produce a current instead. Since your voice is pushing the diaphragm, it is moving the voice coil back and forth generating the current you have observed.<br/><br/>100+ Head-Fier<br/><br/>Joined:<br/>Nov 7, 2011<br/><br/>Posts:<br/>134<br/><br/>Likes: 55<br/><br/>Exactly.

Stalin's opposition within the party, including Bukharin, Yagoda and Rykov were purged in these show trials, as Stalin manipulatively forced them to confess to crimes of planning a coup and opposing the state, even if there was no proof. Gabor T Rittersporn said, "Many of the victims were sincerely devoted to the principles of Bolshevism." This amplifies proof that the Bolshevik ideals that had once been the roots of the Communist Party were being disarranged and destroyed by the Purges. The party was depleted and former members helplessly watched Stalin use the great purge as a tool to transform Russia from a one party state to an unchallenged dictatorship. Again, the purges were shattering the framework of the Communist Party, formed during the Bolshevik revolution. This agrees with the "Stalin the executioner" source as both show the manipulative character, that helped the dictator to enhance his grip on Russia's throat.<br/>The manipulative manner, with which Stalin incriminated his targeted opposition during the purges, in the eyes of everyday Russians, also had an implosive impact on Soviet Society. Stalin was able to collect support from the people through his use of propaganda and the media to help him develop a "cult of personality" and the image of a heroic and brave leader. Through this support Stalin implanted mistrust into the minds of the people, convincing them that traitors of the revolution and what he described as 'enemies of the people', were amongst them.

| Supercell is nerfing brawlers instead of nerfing star powers. I was at 750 last season with power 8 nita and it is very tough to go past that, like, star powers play a really dominant role. The matchmaking is also trash. When i play gem grab(around 600 trophies), there are often matchups where the enemy team has one more player than us who is maxed and it's not even that we have a lvl 9 to compete versus that. Sometimes there are even matchups where the enemy team is fully maxed and none of us are. this is why i dont play brawl stars seriously anymore. It's not even like there arent many players who are not maxed and around 600 trophies. It's annoying.<br/>Edit: I think supercell should have at least a basic mechanism that takes the average of levels of brawlers when setting up matches.<br/><br/>Except trophies don't really indicate your skill. They indicate the skill of the teammates you are placed with. And I'm fine with playing against higher level brawlers, but when one team is all level 10 and the other team isn't, clearly it's unbalanced.<br/><br/>I reccomend getting some good friends to play with, me and 2 friends got my friends power 1 tick to rank 28 by playing gem grab with a certain composition all day and we made it without a single one of us being maxed with our brawlers.<br/><br/>I Know how you feel I used to have brawlers in high trophies with low level and it's to difficult to go more further and everything I was saying to myself "I want to have star powers" really supercell needs to make balance to the star powers or at least make a better matchmaking system.<br/><br/>I kinda feel this. I ain't as good at the game as you, but I got Emz to 500 at power 1 and the matchmaking was horrible. Maxed out players everywhere! And it didn't help that the majority of my teammates had around 5-8k trophies... I had to resort to solo showdown last minute because I can either ambush unsuspecting players or simply play a little aggressive at the right times. But I really wish that it could be a bit easier for people who want to push brawlers to really high trophy ranges without having the luxury of star powers.<br/><br/>Altho spike is still good without curveball. Curveball was just a help for hitting your shots more often as spike. But even before curveball was released, spike was a really strong brawler, so he will remain the same now.<br/><br/>I agree that they should have nerfed ambush, but I think they are trying to balance both Snappy Sniping and Ambush, as they are both getting merged with this change. She was becoming a little powerful, but still not nerf-worthy<br/><br/>I'm not sure about this, but now that Darryl got a noticeable buff, looking at their new stats, it looks like Darryl might overshadow Bull, as not only he can always deal more damage than Bull, he won't die as early anymore, so their survivability will be similar without star power (although Bull's survivability is still noticeably better than Darryl's if he had Tough Guy). Not only that, Darryl's super can auto regenerate, meaning Darryl MIGHT be able to be played effectively both as a heavyweight AND an assassin at the same time (before he sucks as a heavyweight but decent as an assassin)<br/><br/>But hes overrated af. And you get trophies with him really easily. So im kinda ok with the nerf. I havent even played him since when I got him to 500 (around 5 months ago), so not that I care that much either.<br/><br/>Why doesn't Poco/Penny get a HP nerf, if they are Marksman/Healer respectively not a tank?<br/>Why isn't Rosa's tankyness nerfed, cough 70% damage reduction?<br/>Why is Tick allowed to have the highest range and the most free pokedamage in the entire game?<br/>Why doesn't Leon get a HP/Damage buff?<br/><br/>Be that as it may, it was Ambush that was OP, not base Piper. I would argue that Ambush is the best star power in the game (now even more so since the percentage of damage increase indirectly went up) and base Piper was a bottom-10 brawler.<br/><br/>What Supercell should do is revert both nerfs, reduce Ambush to 600, and reduce Snappy Sniping to 0.25 since it'd be indirectly buffed by the base damage buff.<br/><br/>Yea and I believe they went a bit too far with Rosa, because now she is basically the better bull now when it comes to tanking, which she has been for a while. Now, Darryl might as well be a smaller, more powerful bull<br/><br/>Why? I feel she needs a buff in almost everything except her star power. Her health and speed make her super a bit more difficult to use, because she can die pretty easily, and it is really difficult for her to trap faster brawlers like Crow. Her star power is a bit broken though... | Bio sam u 750 prošle sezone sa snagom 8 nita i vrlo je teško proći pored toga da, kao, zvjezdane moći igraju zaista dominantnu ulogu. Kada igram grabbing (oko 600 trofeja), često postoje šibice u kojima neprijateljski tim ima jednog igrača više od nas koji je maksimalno na maksimumu, a nije čak ni da imamo lvl 9 da se takmičimo u odnosu na to. Ponekad su čak i šibice u kojima je neprijateljski tim u potpunosti maxed i nitko od nas su. to je razlog zašto ja ne igraju borbe zvijezde ozbiljno više. to nije čak ni kao da nema puno igrača koji nisu maxed i oko 600 trofeja. To je neugodno.<br/>- Uredi: Mislim da superćelija treba imati barem osnovni mehanizam koji uzima prosječnu razinu tuča prilikom postavljanja šibica.<br/><br/>Samo što trofeji ne ukazuju na tvoju vještinu, nego na vještinu suigrača s kojima si se plasirao, a meni je u redu igrati protiv tuča na višem nivou, ali kad je jedan tim na razini 10, a drugi nije, očito je neuravnotežen.<br/><br/>Preporučio sam da se igram s nekim dobrim prijateljima, ja i dva prijatelja dobili smo snagu mojih prijatelja 1 tik do ranga 28 igrajući se graba dragulja sa određenom kompozicijom cijeli dan i uspjeli smo bez da je jedan od nas bio maksimalno s našim svađačima.<br/><br/>Znam kako se osjećate da sam imao tuče u visokim trofejima sa niskim nivoom i da je teško ići dalje i sve što sam govorio sebi želim imati zvjezdane moći - stvarno superćelija treba napraviti ravnotežu sa zvjezdanim moćima ili barem napraviti bolji sustav spajanja.<br/><br/>Nisam dobar u igri kao ti, ali imam Emz na 500 na snazi 1 i provodadžba je bila užasna, maxed out igrači posvuda, i to nije pomoglo da većina mojih suigrača ima oko 5-8k trofeja... - Morao sam pribjeći solo obračunu u zadnji tren jer mogu ili zasjedu bez sumnje igrati igrače ili jednostavno igrati malo agresivno u pravo vrijeme. Ali stvarno bih voljela da ljudima koji žele gurati borce u velike domete trofeja može biti lakše bez luksuza zvjezdanih moći.<br/><br/>- Alto šiljak je još uvijek dobar bez krive lopte.Curveball je bio samo pomoć za udaranje vaše snimke češće kao šiljak, ali čak i prije nego što je kriva lopta puštena, šiljak je bio stvarno jak tuča, tako da će ostati isti sada.<br/><br/>Ona je postajala malo moćna, ali još uvijek nije vrijedna nerfova.<br/><br/>Nisam siguran u vezi ovoga, ali sada kada je Darryl dobio primjetnog momka, gledajući njihove nove statistike, izgleda da bi Darryl mogao zasjeniti Bulla, jer ne samo da uvijek može podnijeti više štete od Bulla, neće umrijeti tako rano, tako da će njihova preživljivost biti slična bez zvjezdane moći (iako je Bullova survivabilnost još uvijek primjetno bolja od Darrylove ako je imao žestokog tipa). Ne samo to, Darrylov super može se automatski regenerirati, što znači da bi Darryl mogao biti učinkovito odigran i kao teškaš i kao ubojica u isto vrijeme (prije nego što je pušiona kao težak ali pristojan kao ubojica)<br/><br/>Nisam ga ni izigrala otkad sam ga dobila na 500 (oko 5 mjeseci), tako da mi nije ni toliko stalo.<br/><br/>Zašto Poco/Penny ne dobije HP nerf, ako su Marksman/Healer odnosno nisu tenk?<br/>Zašto Rosina tankost nije nerfirana, kašalj 70% smanjenje štete?<br/>Zašto je Ticku dozvoljeno da ima najveći domet i najslobodniji pokedamage u cijeloj igri?<br/>Zašto Leon ne dobije HP/Oštećenje?<br/><br/>Bilo kako bilo, to je bila zasjeda koja je bila OP, a ne baza Piper. Tvrdio bih da je Ambush najbolja zvjezdana moć u igri (sada čak i više od postotka povećanja štete indirektno je išao gore) a baza Piper je bila dna-10 tuča.<br/><br/>Superćelija bi trebala vratiti oba nerfa, smanjiti zasjedu na 600, i smanjiti Snappy Sniping na 0,25 budući da bi bila indirektno ogoljena od strane baznog oštećivanja.<br/><br/>Da i ja vjerujem da su otišli malo predaleko s Rosom, jer sada je ona u osnovi bolji bik sada kada je u pitanju tenkiranje, što je ona već neko vrijeme.<br/><br/>-Osjećam da joj je potrebno ulaštiti gotovo sve osim svoje zvjezdane moći, njeno zdravlje i brzina otežavaju joj korištenje supera, jer može umrijeti prilično lako, i stvarno joj je teško hvatati brže tuče kao što je Vrana. - Njena zvezdana moć je malo slomljena... |

| Self-Employment Part 1<br/><br/>When you accept an employment in any organisation, you have to perform various jobs as per the requirements of your employer and you may get a fixed amount of income as salary. You may run a small retail shop, tailoring shop, restaurant, bakery and confectionery, beauty salon, etc. in your locality. You may get engaged in trading or manufacturing on a small scale or providing some service for a price. Such economic activities are known as self-employment.<br/><br/>Meaning of Self-Employment<br/><br/>Earning is necessary for a living. Our father, mother, brothers, sisters and others may be engaged in different economic activities through which they earn their livelihood. These persons are engaged in an economic activity which is termed as wage employment or paid employment. But there are many persons who engage themselves in an occupation or some business which they start and manage on their own. They put in their best effort and take all types of risks to pursue their careers successfully. The entire earning of their work goes to them. All of us have seen small grocery shops, tailoring shops, medical stores etc. in our locality. These are owned and managed by a person, with or without the help of some assistants. Their economic activities are termed as self-employment. So, when an individual engages in any economic activity and manages it on his own, it is known as self-employment.<br/><br/>Objectives<br/><br/>After studying this lesson, you will be able to:<br/><br/>Image of Objectives<br/><br/>Image of Objectives<br/><br/>Characteristics of Self-Employment<br/><br/>It involves ownership and management of activities by a person although he/she may take the help of one or two persons to assist him/her. Thus, self-employment may provide employment to other persons as well.<br/><br/>The earning from self-employment is not fixed. It depends on the income one can earn by producing or buying and selling goods or providing services to others at a price.<br/><br/>In self-employment, the owner alone has to take the profit and bear the risk of loss. So, we find a direct link between the effort and reward in self-employment.<br/><br/>It requires some amount of capital investment, although it may be small.<br/><br/>In self-employment, a person is free to take decisions in respect of running his business profitably and avail of any opportunity that may come up for expansion of his business. It gives complete freedom to work as per one's own will and within the parameters of the prevailing laws.<br/><br/>Thus, self-employment may be defined as, an economic activity which one may perform on his own as a gainful occupation, and this may consist of producing and selling goods, buying and selling goods, or rendering services for a price. | Prvi dio samozapošljavanja<br/><br/>- Kada prihvatite zaposlenje u bilo kojoj organizaciji, morate obavljati razne poslove prema zahtjevima poslodavca i možete dobiti fiksni iznos prihoda kao plaću. Možete voditi malu trgovinu, krojačnicu, restoran, pekaru i slastičarnu, kozmetički salon i sl. u svom lokalitetu. - Takve ekonomske aktivnosti su poznate kao samozapošljavanje.<br/><br/>Značenje samozapošljavanja<br/><br/>Naš otac, majka, braća, sestre i drugi mogu se baviti različitim ekonomskim aktivnostima kroz koje zarađuju za život. Te osobe se bave ekonomskom aktivnošću koja se naziva platama ili plaćenim zaposlenjem, ali ima mnogo osoba koje se bave zanimanjem ili nekim poslom koji započinju i upravljaju samostalno. Svi smo vidjeli male trgovine, krojaonice, medicinske trgovine itd. u našem lokalitetu. Oni su u vlasništvu i upravljaju osobom, sa ili bez pomoći nekih pomoćnika. Njihove ekonomske aktivnosti se nazivaju samozapošljavanjem.
