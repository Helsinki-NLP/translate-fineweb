| Bacopa<br/><br/>19 Nov 2015<br/>Posted by Doxiderol<br/><br/>Bacopa is a perennial plant that thrives in marshy subtropical and tropical regions around the globe. The highly regarded herb is a key ingredient in Doxiderol, a nutritional supplement that enhances cognitive function. Bacopa was chosen for its ability to protect the brain and increase acetylcholine, a biochemical messenger that enables the nervous system to relay information.<br/><br/>Ayurvedic practitioners first described the therapeutic properties of bacopa in 300 BC. The physicians recorded bacopa's abilities to enhance intelligence and memory. Nearly 2,500 years later, a growing body of modern research confirms the cognitive benefits of bacopa recorded in the Ayurvedic text.<br/><br/>In 1987, researchers in India evaluated the effects of bacopa on the intellectual function of school-aged children. During the four-week study, they administered bacopa to 40 children who were 6 to 8 years old. The scientists determined that bacopa increased perception and memory. The children were able to solve maze exercises quicker and more accurately after receiving bacopa. Many parents in India routinely use bacopa to enhance their children's intellectual development.<br/><br/>A 12-week study published in the August 2001 issue of Psychopharmacology investigated the effects of bacopa on cognitive function. Scientists randomly assigned the healthy volunteers, aged 18 to 65, to receive bacopa or an inactive substance. They also used a double-blind configuration for the study to conceal the identities of the products. Researchers use this design to ensure that the test results are valid because it eliminates bias by the researchers and participants. The bacopa group experienced a significant improvement in the speed at which they were able to process visual information. The participants also learned faster and stored new memories more efficiently.<br/><br/>In 2007, a Texas A&M College of Medicine laboratory study revealed one of the mechanisms responsible for bacopa's ability to promote brain health. According to the scientists, bacopa uses polyphenols to prevent oxidative stress and the damage that it causes to healthy brain cells. Bacopa also reduces harmful deposits of a substance known as beta-amyloid, which is the primary component of the plaque in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease.<br/><br/>A double-blind study published in the July 2008 issue of the Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine evaluated the effect of bacopa on elderly patients. The study confirmed that bacopa increased cognitive performance while reducing stress. According to the authors, the benefits achieved in this study confirmed the results of earlier research.<br/><br/>A 90-day study published in the December 2008 issue of Phytotherapy Research confirms the cognitive benefits that were previously demonstrated in other bacopa studies. Bacopa significantly improved the ability of the participants to temporarily store and use information required for completing a complex task. The double-blind study also demonstrated that bacopa reduced the time required to process visual information.<br/><br/>In addition to enhancing nerve signal transmission, the scientists theorize that bacopa increases cognitive function by reducing anxiety. Numerous studies indicate that anxiety interferes with the ability to perform tasks that require higher-level cognitive functions, such as learning and memorization. Stress disrupts biochemical messengers and healthy nerve signal transmission. Bacopa alleviates stress and restores a sense of calm by increasing acetylcholine levels, which reduces your heart rate and enables you to take deeper breaths.<br/><br/>Doxiderol is a great way to obtain the benefits of bacopa. This holistic supplement also contains other natural ingredients that promote brain health and support your ability to focus and concentrate on complex task as well as memorize information. | - Bacopa.<br/><br/>19 Nov 2015<br/>- Posted by Doksiderol<br/><br/>Bacopa je trajnica koja uspijeva u močvarnim suptropskim i tropskim regijama širom svijeta. visoko cijenjena biljka je ključni sastojak u Doksiderolu, prehrambenom dodatku koji pojačava kognitivne funkcije. - Bacopa je izabran zbog svoje sposobnosti zaštite mozga i povećanja acetilholina, biokemijskog glasnika koji omogućava živčanom sustavu da prenosi informacije.<br/><br/>Ayurvedski praktičari prvi su opisali terapeutska svojstva bakopa 300. godine p.n.e. Liječnici su zabilježili Bakopine sposobnosti da poboljšaju inteligenciju i pamćenje. Skoro 2.500 godina kasnije, rastuće tijelo modernih istraživanja potvrđuje kognitivne koristi bakope zabilježene u ayurvedskom tekstu.<br/><br/>1987. istraživači u Indiji ocijenili su učinke bakopa na intelektualnu funkciju školske djece. Tijekom četverotjednog studija davali su bakopu 40-ero djece koja su imala 6 do 8 godina. Naučnici su utvrdili da je bakopa povećala percepciju i pamćenje. Mnogi roditelji u Indiji rutinski koriste bakopu kako bi poboljšali intelektualni razvoj svoje djece.<br/><br/>12-tjedna studija objavljena u izdanju Psihofarmakologije u kolovozu 2001. istraživala je učinke bacipe na kognitivne funkcije. Znanstvenici su slučajno dodijelili zdravim volonterima, u dobi od 18 do 65 godina, da primaju bakopu ili neaktivnu supstancu. Istraživači koriste ovaj dizajn kako bi osigurali da rezultati testova budu valjani jer se njime eliminira pristranost istraživača i sudionika. Učesnici su također brže naučili i učinkovitije pohranili nova sjećanja.<br/><br/>U 2007. godini laboratorijska studija Teksaškog A&M Medicinskog fakulteta otkrila je jedan od mehanizama odgovornih za bakopinu sposobnost promoviranja moždanog zdravlja. - Prema znanstvenicima, bakopa koristi polifenole kako bi spriječila oksidativni stres i štetu koju uzrokuje zdravim moždanim stanicama. - Bacapa također smanjuje štetne naslage tvari poznate kao beta-amiloid, koja je primarna komponenta plaka u mozgu bolesnika s Alzheimerovom bolešću.<br/><br/>U dvostruko slijepom ispitivanju objavljenom u izdanju časopisa Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine u srpnju 2008. procijenjen je učinak bakopa na starije bolesnike. Ispitivanje je potvrdilo da je bakopa povećala kognitivne performanse uz smanjenje stresa. Prema autorima, koristi ostvarene u ovoj studiji potvrdile su rezultate ranijih istraživanja.<br/><br/>90-dnevna studija objavljena u izdanju Phytotherapy Research u prosincu 2008. godine potvrđuje kognitivne koristi koje su ranije pokazane u drugim studijama bacipa. Bacopa je značajno poboljšala sposobnost sudionika da privremeno pohrane i koriste informacije potrebne za izvršavanje složenog zadatka. Dvostruko slijepa studija također je pokazala da je Bacopa smanjila vrijeme potrebno za obradu vizualnih informacija.<br/><br/>- Uz povećanje prijenosa nervnog signala, znanstvenici teoretišu da bakopa povećava kognitivne funkcije smanjujući anksioznost. Brojne studije pokazuju da anksioznost ometa sposobnost obavljanja zadataka koji zahtijevaju kognitivne funkcije više razine, kao što su učenje i pamćenje. Stres ometa biokemijske glasnike i zdrav prijenos živčanog signala. Bacopa ublažava stres i vraća osjećaj smirenosti povećanjem razine acetilholina, što smanjuje otkucaje srca i omogućuje vam da udahnete dublje.<br/><br/>Ovaj holistički dodatak sadrži i druge prirodne sastojke koji promiču zdravlje mozga i podržavaju vašu sposobnost fokusiranja i koncentracije na složeni zadatak kao i informacije za pamćenje. |

She can also sense demonic auras as well as evil auras. When she was born and growing, however, her powers were sealed and she was much less powerful. Since the defeat of the one sealing her powers, Kagome has reached her full potential.<br/><br/>PURIFICATION By making a physical connection, Kagome has the ability to purify both poison and darkness from a subject (living and inanimate). To do so, she projects her spiritual powers through her hand.<br/><br/>SPIRITUAL BARRIERS With her full potential, Kagome has the ability to create a barrier around herself and expand it around others. It is a dome-shaped barrier that can destroy weak demons that make contact with the barrier.<br/><br/>IMPROVED EYESIGHT<br/>Kagome has the ability to see things that are often invisible to the human eye: ghosts, spirits, divine and evil auras.<br/><br/>ABILITIES WITH WEAPONS<br/>Kagome has the ability to use a bow and arrow. She has been self trained, and after years of practice, her arrow rarely misses its mark. Alongside this, Kagome has the ability to infuse her arrows with powers. She can infuse an arrows with her spiritual powers which allows them to penetrate demonic forces, destroy spells, and purify objects. She can infuse her bow with her powers and deflect enemy attacks. She has the ability to infuse her arrows with purifying energy to purify poison as well as powerful, long distant demonic attacks. And, finally, she has the ability to bypass others with her arrow: If her target happens to be behind a barrier or a hostage, the arrow can teleport and hit only her target<br/><br/>The rest of her abilities have become rather unimportant as they are related to time travel (through the Bone Eater's Well), the Shikon Jewel, or her previous incarnation.<br/><br/>the canon<br/><br/>Kagome has been pulled a few days after her high school graduation, however, before the Bone Eater's Well has opened again to allow her to return to the past permanently.<br/><br/>freestyle<br/><br/>memories<br/><br/>かごめ<br/><br/>The sound of her name was a soft whisper in the back of her mind, like a call muffled by the wind. It was the sound of a distant memory, a voice that she had started to forget but desperately clung to all the same. It was her mother's voice, twisted in the sorrow of her lost daughter. Afterall, Kagome banished without a trace. She vividly remembered those moments, the way the day had begun, what she had for breakfast and the last thing she had said to her mother. It was haunting, those memories, because it was like any other time she had slipped between worlds. She had woken, listless, because she had no purpose outside of school. She could find a job, and was scheduled for an interview that day. Her heart hadn't been in it, but it was what she needed to do.<br/><br/>She remembered the feeling of dread, sucking it up and giving herself a pep talk that she could do this. That she could progress in the life that she was meant to now that things had been settled in the past. Of course, she had the lingering feeling that she no longer belonged in her own time or her own life. Not with everything that she had left behind.<br/><br/>Kagome remembered the feeling of the wood beneath her fingers, the way her hand had curled into the handle to slide the door open. She remembered that she paused, turning to her mother with a bright and vibrant smile as she shook herself from her stupor. "I'm taking off." She remembered how strong her voice sounded, the smile on her mother's lips as her eyes shone with pride. Her mother bade her farewell, which didn't seem any different than before but somehow the weight of the words settled in heavier on Kagome's shoulders the more she reflected.<br/><br/>Briefly, the thoughts flickered forward, wondering if her mother worried over her, missed her like she did. Kagome could openly admit that her mother's strength, her support for the fact that her daughter slipped through time so frequently. There were times when she thought herself weak for not having the woman to lean on.<br/><br/>However, she remembered that she did muster up a meager amount of strength.She could remember the shift in the air, the temperature notably different than what she had expected, blinking at the sudden and unfamiliar surroundings. It was not her family's shrine. And when she turned to go back, to slip through the door she had come through, she was met with unfamiliar and cold metal beneath her fingertips and an interior that was not the entrance of her house. A man stood before her, behind a counter, who stared at her with eyes as wide as her own.<br/><br/>She didn't panic, at least. Being torn through time and placed in impossible situations at least built your willpower as far as strange happenings went. Because it wasn't every day that someone found themselves dragged into the past by a demon, intent on ripping a powerful jewel from their body that they didn't even know was there. And then there was the fact that she had shattered said powerful jewel into who knows how many pieces and was tasked on finding them. Such things were not normal, and she had needed to square up and roll with it once she realized that was her reality. It had seemed so simple, just gather the shards and fix the jewel.<br/><br/>But it hadn't been easy, there were many demons after the shards and the jewel itself. And one particularly powerful demon with a wish that he was determined to see fulfilled. To this day, she had never learned his wish but knew it had never been granted even once he had the blasted thing completed. He had ruined so many lives for the sake of nothing. Ruined so many lives for such a futile task. Naraku had been the most difficult foe, and the one who had been the center of everything that had gone wrong in all of her friend's lives.<br/><br/>But, it was that unpredicability, that necessity to roll with what was happening and the willpower that she had gained from her adventure that she remembered drawing upon to come up with a story that fit in the moment that didn't seem too whimsical or far fetched. She needed to be believed, she needed to survive.<br/><br/>Afterall, she faced worse than a man in a camera store. She had lied through her teeth to save her life before.<br/><br/>"I was looking for a job." In the end, it wasn't a complete lie. After all, she had set out of her house with the intent of attending a job interview. Her state of dress would at least attest to that much. It was one of the easier fibs she had ever told.<br/><br/>And, for some reason, that crazy man hired her.<br/><br/>かごめ<br/><br/>Kagomed rolled over in her bed as she pushed back the distant memories, refusing to acknowledge that she was really awake. She clawed at the last glimpses of sleep, begging it to return and to take her back into its embrace. She closed her eyes, willing sleep to come and was only met with memories. The echoes of a song sang in the distance of her memories, a song that had often tormented her, given the same name as her. The voice that sang was no longer reminiscent of her mother, but the voices of children who she had often played with growing up. They called back the memories, even though it had been years since she started this live, even though she was happy in this life, the call of these memories was too loud.<br/><br/>Suddenly, she was falling back into them and sleep evaded her again. She was watching herself in her family's embrace while Inuyasha was pulled back into the well, looking as startled as she had felt. The memories of that moment, those feelings, were still so strong. The feeling of heartbreak and sorrow welled up again though it had been so long since she had felt like she had been ripped away from everything that mattered to her.<br/><br/>Of course her family mattered, and she was happy to be in their arms again. She could never fully, truly describe how she had felt in those days. She still couldn't explain the way she felt split in two, with warring desires to be in both her past and present. She remembered the futile attempts to jump through the well, fingers clawing at the ground in a desperate plea to let her return. The first month home, she didn't sleep so much as she cried.<br/><br/>Elysion had garnished a similar reaction, though it was not so fierce because she didn't know exactly where she had slipped through nor did she know where she could worm her way back. Her explorations were subtle between working her job and trying to settle herself into this life. She had no intentions of staying, no intentions of lingering longer than she needed. And while she didn't try as fiercely as she had when she tried to return to the past, her passion was tenfold because she had no ties to this world. Because she was truly alone… With no hope of anyone to reach her.<br/><br/>In her irrational moments, she thought the Jewel had pulled her back and found a new hell for her to reside in. A new hell that would force her to make a wish, but she remembered very clearly that she had wished it gone forever. That didn't stop her dreams, the times when she woke up in the night sobbing. And those memories of her past were the hardest to deal with, the hardest to forget. Her heart began to race in a panic as she turned in her bed again, her breath became a struggle as she fought against a panic attack induced by her wandering mind this late into the night.<br/><br/>She hated feeling so weak, so afraid.<br/><br/>籠の中の鳥は<br/><br/>Kagome finally pulled herself from bed, her room lit with a pale light that was enough to guide her to the bathroom. She stood before the mirror, the sink running while she stared at her reflection. Raven colored hair covered her face and she felt as bad as she looked. Her first morning in Elysion was similar to this, only she was in worse shape.<br/><br/>She had found a place to sleep, managing to work out a deal with the owner of the building to allow her to stay a small period of time without paying. Perhaps it had been Miroku's influence that allowed her to strike such deals, as the monk was known for his way in charming (or scamming) people into giving them more than enough for the work they had done. The monk had always been that way, since they had first met. He would claim the dwelling of a lord to be haunted when it was not or, claim that they were subject to an attack when they would not be. He would sell his wards and charms for such high prices. It worked practically every time and she wondered why people had been so willing to trust him.<br/><br/>Perhaps it was his smile, or the fact that he was a monk that the people of the past were so willing to crumble. He never preyed on the weak, at least. He always did what was right and he was a symbol of strength to her at times when he would push through everything in order to do what was right. He pushed through the fact that he was dying, that he was cursed, and tried to do something about it rather than wallowing in his fate. He had pushed himself to the limit in the time leading up to their final fight. And she had been glad that they had defeated Naraku before he could become subject to the same fate as his father, and his father before him.<br/><br/>As far as her own charms went, however, she was more fair than her friend and made the deal reasonable. She doubted that anyone in this world would pay a hefty price for an exorcism or banishing demons. They were too technologically advanced for that. But she was clever enough, and smart enough, to make a good deal.<br/><br/>But now, Kagome was in a better place though the look on her face looked the same. Haunted, tired, drained...<br/><br/>A quick glance at a clock on the wall told her that she could try to sleep longer. But she opted out of that, not wanting to face the flashbacks again. She took a shower instead, using the cold water to chase away her demons, to fill her lungs with a sharp intake of breath and force herself awake.<br/><br/>いついつ出やる<br/><br/>It didn't work.<br/><br/>Not in the way she was wanting. The cold water certainly forced the air into her lungs, forced her mind to wake and muscles to seize. A bitter laugh was pulled from her lips as she tilted her head back and found herself remembering more. Today, she wasn't going to escape them so easily. She wasn't going to recover so simply, to recover just because she willed it.<br/><br/>Sometimes, there's no avoiding the thoughts you wanted to. Even when you were certain that you were past them.<br/><br/>Sango would have been a great help in this situation. The demon slayer was her best friend, she would even go as far as to call her the sister that she never had. An older sister who was wise, always had her side when trouble arose. Particularly boy trouble, when such things were rather trivial but it was fun to have a crush and for her friend to be mad on her behalf when Inuyasha made her sad. After all, it had been often that the half-demon would run to his dead lover's side and break her heart more than once.<br/><br/>But, Sango also inspired her in other ways. After all the woman had faced, she had always been so strong, so sure... Even in the times that she had doubted herself, she always pulled through. She admired that she had the ability to survive after losing her whole family -- the reminder of this often pushed Kagome to survive, because she lost everyone to this world -- and then having her brother become a pawn of Naraku. It wasn't easy, couldn't have been something to that just anyone could face and still go forward with. She still smiled, even with that pain and those reminders... She was often so bright, even in the darker times.<br/><br/>And right now, she wanted to lean into the older woman's side, to take comfort in the fact that she was there and she was supportive. She felt that Sango would somehow pull through this, and offer some words of strength and understanding. It was times like these that made these spells worse, the constant reminder that she was without her family.<br/><br/>"I don't want to be alone." She cried aloud in her solitude, the sound of the shower drowning out the plea.<br/><br/>She wasn't afraid to admit it.<br/><br/>夜明けの晩に<br/><br/>Another hour had slipped by before she had realized it. Her skin was cold from the water and it felt like ice ran through her veins. She hadn't realized she had begun to shiver until her hand reached to turn off the water and end her shower. Kagome didn't seek her own gaze in the mirror again, instead, she wrapped herself in towels and trudged out of the bathroom, up the stairs and into her kitchen. She started on making a light breakfast, idly reading through her notes for the day as the food cooked.<br/><br/>Her career was really taking off these last years. Her photos were featured in many galleries, her name started to frequent many lips for those who were interested in photography.<br/><br/>The job she had asked for on a whim had sparked it all. She had been far more lucky than she had expected to be in this world. Never lucky enough to slip back through the cracks into her own world, but lucky enough to do well. As she turned back to the stove, she remembered the time she had finally given up on returning home. It was about two years into her life here, as she had started to venture into photography as more than just a hobby but something she could make a name for herself with.<br/><br/>That day had been particularly pleasant, the sun was high in the sky and she had found herself taking some photos of the natural scenery. A little boy had hidden in one of the plants, and she had caught a picture of the moment his face had settled into a cheerful, mischievous grin the moment before he had jumped out to startle his prey. It reminded her of Shippou, the little kitsune she had, essentially, adopted. He, too, had been torn from his family when they had first met. His father killed and he was determined to avenge him. While young, he did seem so mature in their first encounters.<br/><br/>Maybe it had been the influence of Inuyasha that allowed the kit to act like a kid again, to be young and whimsical at times while others he was more mature. He offered comfort to her in his own way, and she tried to care for him as she would her own though she had been so young then as well. However, her youth did not stop her from understanding how to tend to him or care for him like her child. Her heart swelled when he smiled, when he had been so happy for his gift of crayons and took the time to make art. She was so proud of each drawing that he had finished that she knew that this was how a mother would feel in such a situation.<br/><br/>The pain that had ripped through her was too much, too sudden. She missed him and wanted to see how much he had grown since she had been gone. She had missed so much...<br/><br/>To spare herself any further pain, any false hopes… She gave up. And focused on bettering herself.<br/><br/>鶴と亀が<br/><br/>Breakfast tasted bland, boring, and inspired. Only after she had finished did she realized she had forgotten to any sort of spices or flavor to the food. It was too late now to remember that much, as her mind was too busy remembering other details of her life that clearly had become more important than her food.<br/><br/>"Sit!"<br/><br/>Of course, nothing happened when she had angrily yelled at one particularly frustrating client that reminded her of the half-demon. He was being particularly stubborn and rude, wanting a photo taken his way rather than letting it work out naturally. You could try to force wild animals to behave how you wanted. But, rarely did anyone succeed with force. Inuyasha wasn't as bad, however. Inuyasha had learned before she had been forced away from him. He had become gentler, more understanding, more mature though there were times he was still childish and cocky.<br/><br/>She remember how red her cheeks had burned, but how she stood her ground and fired him. She told him she refused to work for anyone or with anyone who wanted to twist something beyond it's nature, beyond it's own desires.<br/><br/>She should have compared the man to Naraku rather than Inuyasha. Though her client did not have such extreme intentions. At least the feeling afterwards was a pleasant memory. The freedom of knowing that she had come so far that she could refuse work that she didn't want to do, to be her own person that was independent of others. She could say that she made it at that point. Even though she heard rumors days later with words meant to slander her.<br/><br/>She defended herself righteously, like she did towards the end of her journey. After all, she was the only one who could protect herself in this world.<br/><br/>滑った<br/><br/>Morning light began to creep into her home, reminding her again of the passage of time. Again, she considered the list of things she had to do and debated on where to start. Or, if she should even start at all. With how the day began, she didn't know if she could consider that a great idea. It was doubtful that she would be successful with how lost in herself she was becoming.<br/><br/>She didn't want to mess up her latest work. Because she had done that on a few occasions before. It wasn't pleasant to try and recover from a complete disaster.<br/><br/>Kagome remembered the feeling of her expensive, brand new, camera slipping from her hands. She wasn't prepared to support it, because she had just removed it from her bag. Part of her screamed on the inside. A dramatic, over-the-top, full on scream that she frequently did when she was much, much younger. When she was struggling to make it through middle school while hopping between times. The other part of her had remained frozen in place while her lense completely shattered and the rest of the camera had broken along with it.<br/><br/>Seeing Inuyasha's brother, a full demon, standing before her was the last thing she expected when she had made her way out for her photos. He stood as proud as ever, as tall as ever, as imposing as she remembered. He didn't look fazed at all to be in an entirely different world, though she was never the best at reading his mind. His name on her lips was so potent, that she could remember the tiniest feelings as she did. Her lips were chapped, her mouth felt dry, and the bubbling feeling of anxiety in her stomach made her feel sick.<br/><br/>She didn't want her hopes to be up.<br/><br/>But, she wanted him to be there, even if they were not friends. They were allies, if anything, since they had fought side by side. And something was better than absolutely nothing.<br/><br/>And Kagome had the sense enough not to throw herself at him, to wrap her arms around him in relief that knowing she was not alone. Her camera no longer mattered when she approached him. She remembered that nothing else mattered for days as she spent time with him, not speaking of their world but speaking (or, she was speaking and he simply acknowledged that fact).<br/><br/>When, exactly, she fell for him though… Kagome couldn't recall. It was a subtle thing, just like he was. But she knew the feeling was there. And he let her know that she was not alone in the fact that she had fallen, that feelings had somehow blossomed.<br/><br/>後ろの正面<br/><br/>A feeling of weightlessness overtook her and suddenly her eyes opened while her mind desperately clawed for the last thing she was doing. She didn't recall when she had fallen asleep on her couch, but she knew the last place she had been was on the far too comfortable cushions. She didn't struggle, however, or fight the weightlessness as she was in familiar arms. Her head tilted against Sesshoumaru's chest, taking comfort in the fact that he was here and she wasn't alone.<br/><br/>"Welcome back." His response was a soft hum in acknowledgement. He didn't need to speak much for her to understand his intent, or the rest of what he had to say.<br/><br/>He carried her back to her bed, settled her into it with ease. Her eyes met his and she smiled easily because no more memories drifted back, no more recollections teased at her. No, whenever he was near, she never fell back into those thoughts. He had helped, and the years had helped. Today was just… One of those days.<br/><br/>"Sleep." He commanded with ease, her eyes rolled at him but she did not fight because she was tired. Her hand clung tightly to him, while she felt his opposite hand press to her forehead in assessment of her wellbeing.<br/><br/>"I'm okay," she said, her words firm with her promise.<br/><br/>She was okay. She was alive. And she was happy.<br/><br/>だあれ<br/><br/>shipper<br/><br/>summary<br/><br/>Kagome, at one point in her life, was a rather regular teenage girl until she was attacked by a demon inside her family's well house. The demon dragged her down into the well, which magically transported her about 500 years into the past. There, she learned that a sacred jewel was encased inside her body as she was the reincarnation of a priestess that had died 50 years prior to the time she was dragged into. The jewel was ripped from her body and the demon that dragged her through time was defeated by the half-demon that she freed who was pinned to the tree. Kagome befriended the half-demon, Inuyasha, in time and traveled with him to restore the jewel that she, herself, shattered. Though it was not so straightforward and easy to do as many demons and humans sought the jewel for their own purposes. She befriended a young kitsune demon, a monk, and a demon slayer who all traveled with her to restore the jewel.<br/><br/>Her group, however, was not the one to complete the jewel. Instead, an evil half-demon who manipulated the majority of the major events in most of her companion's lives. When he finally collected all the pieces of the jewel and made his wish on the tainted object, Kagome was drawn into the jewel itself with the intent of her making a selfish wish to keep her trapped inside forever, keeping the jewel alive. It was the stubbornness of Inuyasha that managed to save her from the darkness. In the end, she returned to her natural time, finished high school as was expect from a girl of her timeline. Though days later, Kagome ended up in Elysion. She has been in this world for five years, and has long since given up on returning home. She's settled happily into her new life.<br/><br/>platonic<br/><br/>It's rather easy for Kagome to make new friends, she hasn't changed much from her youth. She is a cheerful young woman who is empathetic and welcoming to most of all in her life. In her youth, she befriended demons when most would fear them. Even demons that used to eat humans, she has befriended and she changed their ways (she'd like to think). This being said, it's really easy to become her friend as long as someone is able to shown that they are willing to be redeemed, or show that they are not completely evil. She feels greatly for everyone she meets, so it's hard for her not to be drawn to others in a desire to be friends.<br/><br/>antagonistic<br/><br/>The only way to earn Kagome's wrath is to be so deplorable, so evil, and so far beyond redemption that she can't see any good in you. And she can see the good in pretty much everyone and everything. Honestly, with whom she has faced? A half-demon that pitted two lovers against each other, that cursed the entire male line of one of her friends, and then had her best friend's brother kill their family… Yeah, I don't see her hating anyone without them really, really working for it. Feel free to give it a shot, though.<br/><br/>romantic<br/><br/>When in love, Kagome is a strong support, always staying there even when things may be rough. However, Kagome is not looking for love, wasn't looking for love when she arrived so any past relationships don't exist. This isn't to say that someone hasn't fallen in love with her. She can definitely be the subject of someone's unrequited love, she'll probably be oblivious about it, though. Finally, Kagome is currently engaged to Sesshoumaru, surprisingly. I'm totally open to potential AU things, though. <3<br/><br/>fandom hell<br/><br/>age ancient<br/><br/>species space queen<br/><br/>occupation dying<br/><br/>prefers she/her<br/><br/>awards<br/><br/>pro<br/>she/her est 62woo i suck at plot replies. but ok anyway!!! neptune is very friendly and has that 'cool' persona, he's really fun to be around, and he's SUPER good to work with. like he's super patient and he'll do anything she asks of him--he's really easy to work with, definitely in comparison to other models. so i love the idea of them being all work oriented friends at first and then turning into something more. neptune definitely tries to surround himself with people, because he loves having friends, and kagome is pretty much his type too? like she's sweet and she's a strong woman, and he is actually better friends with women than he is with men, idk why, he just loves being surrounded by female friends who knows. i love my guys being super good friends and protecting their girl friends honestly. but oh M A N i love pseduo-family type relationships and neptune is an only child, so he hasn't had any like, familial relationships like that. so her looking out for him all big sister like would make him be like ????? cause he's confused but also he actually really likes that LOL! they're both good kids, i think they'd be really fun ^^<br/><br/>fandom fire emblem: fates<br/><br/>age ninteen<br/><br/>species Part human / part dragon<br/><br/>occupation representative guardian<br/><br/>prefers she/her<br/><br/>awards<br/><br/>yonder<br/>she/her aest 20 posts<br/><br/>I haven't seen Inuyasha at all but... from what I've read Kagome seems to be one of those people who might be able to help Corrin out with her emotional state. There's a lot weighing on her mind since she had to fight her birth family against her will and last time she saw them they all pretty much hated her. Frankly she hasn't worked through everything yet since she was essentially at the head of a full-scale war.

I love your idea of Kagome taking a pic of Elsa! You know, she's also a singer/performer at a local theater so I can imagine Kagome going there to scope things out and then catching Elsa backstage or something--and then the friendship could blossom from there!

Nakon svega, Kagome je protjerana bez traga, jasno se sjetila tih trenutaka, načina na koji je dan počeo, što je doručkovala i zadnje što je rekla majci. To je bilo opsedanje, ta sjećanja, jer je bilo kao i svaki drugi put kad se okliznula između svjetova, probudila se, bez popisa, jer nije imala svrhu izvan škole, mogla je naći posao, i bila je zakazana za intervju tog dana. - Njeno srce nije bilo u njemu, ali to je bilo ono što je morala da uradi.<br/><br/>Sjetila se osjećaja straha, ulizivanja i davanja sebi poticajni govor da to može učiniti, da može napredovati u životu koji joj je suđen sada kada su stvari bile riješene u prošlosti. Naravno, imala je osjećaj da više ne pripada u svoje vrijeme ili u vlastiti život, ne sa svime što je ostavila iza sebe.<br/><br/>Kagome se sjetila osjećaja drva ispod prstiju, načina na koji joj se ruka uvijala u dršku kako bi kliznula kroz vrata, sjetila se da je zastala, okrenuvši se majci sa sjajnim i živahnim osmijehom dok se tresla od svog omamljivanja. Setila se kako joj je jak glas zvučao, osmeh na usnama njene majke dok su joj oči sijale od ponosa. - Njena majka se oprostila od nje, što nije izgledalo drugačije nego ranije ali nekako se težina riječi naselila u težini na Kagomeinim ramenima što se više odražavala.<br/><br/>Kagome je mogla otvoreno priznati snagu svoje majke, podršku za činjenicu da joj je kći tako često skliznula kroz vrijeme. Bilo je trenutaka kada je mislila da je slaba jer nije imala ženu na koju bi se mogla osloniti.<br/><br/>Međutim, sjetila se da je skupila oskudnu količinu snage, mogla se sjetiti pomaka u zraku, temperature posebno drugačije nego što je očekivala, trepćući u iznenadnom i nepoznatom okruženju. Kada se okrenula da se vrati, da bi se ušuljala kroz vrata kroz koja je ušla, našla se sa nepoznatim i hladnim metalom ispod vrhova prstiju i interijerom koji nije bio ulaz u njenu kuću. Pred njom je stajao čovjek, iza pulta, koji je buljio u nju očima širokim kao i njene.<br/><br/>Bila je rastrgana kroz vrijeme i stavljena u nemoguće situacije barem je izgradila tvoju snagu volje što se tiče čudnih događanja. Nije se svaki dan netko našao odvučen u prošlost od demona, s namjerom da istrgne snažan dragulj iz njihovog tijela za koji nisu ni znali da je tamo. I onda se pojavila činjenica da je razbila moćni dragulj u koji zna koliko komada i imala je zadatak da ih pronađe. Izgledalo je tako jednostavno, samo skupite krhotine i popravite dragulj.<br/><br/>Ali nije bilo lako, bilo je mnogo demona nakon krhotina i samog dragulja i posebno moćnog demona sa željom koju je bio odlučan da vidi ispunjenu. On je uništio toliko života ni zbog čega, uništio toliko života za tako uzaludan zadatak. Naraku je bio najteži neprijatelj, i ona koja je bila centar svega što je pošlo po zlu u životu njene prijateljice.<br/><br/>Ali, to je bila ta nepredvidljivost, potreba da se mota sa onim što se dešavalo i snaga volje koju je stekla iz svoje avanture koje se sjetila da je navukla da smisli priču koja se uklapa u trenutak koji nije izgledao previše hirovit ili daleko privučen. -Trebalo joj je vjerovati, bilo joj je potrebno preživjeti.<br/><br/>Lagala je kroz zube da bi spasila život.<br/><br/>Na kraju krajeva, ona je izašla iz svoje kuće s namjerom da prisustvuje razgovoru za posao, njeno stanje odijevanja bi barem potvrdilo da je to bila jedna od lakših laži koje je ikad rekla.<br/><br/>- I iz nekog razloga, taj ludak ju je unajmio.<br/><br/>- â TM s â TM s<br/><br/>Kagomed se prevrnula u svom krevetu dok je odgurivala daleka sjećanja, odbijajući priznati da je stvarno budna, grebala je na posljednjim pogledima sna, preklinjući ga da se vrati i da je vrati u svoj zagrljaj. Zatvorila je oči, voljna zaspati da bi došla i bila je susrela se samo sa uspomenama, odjecima pjesme pjevane u daljini sjećanja, pjesmom koja ju je često mučila, s obzirom na isto ime kao i ona. Glas koji je pjevao više nije podsjećao na njenu majku, nego na glasove djece s kojom se često igrala dok je odrastala. Vratili su sjećanja, iako su prošle godine otkako je počela živjeti, iako je bila sretna u ovom životu, poziv tih sjećanja bio je preglasan.<br/><br/>Gledala je sebe u obiteljskom zagrljaju dok je Inuyasha uvučena u bunar, izgledala je zaprepašteno kao što se osjećala. Sjećanja na taj trenutak, ti osjećaji, još uvijek su bili tako jaki, osjećaj slomljenog srca i tuge je opet ozdravio, iako je prošlo toliko dugo od kada se osjećala kao da joj je oduzeto sve što joj je bilo važno.<br/><br/>Naravno da joj je obitelj bila važna i bila je sretna što im je opet u naručju. Još uvijek nije mogla objasniti kako se osjećala podijeljenom na dva dijela, s zaraćenom željom da bude i u svojoj prošlosti i u sadašnjosti. Prvi mjesec doma nije spavala toliko koliko je plakala.<br/><br/>Elysion je garnirala sličnu reakciju, iako nije bila tako žestoka jer nije znala točno gdje se provukla niti je znala gdje se može vratiti. Nije imala namjeru ostati, ostati duže nego što je trebala. I dok se nije toliko žestoko trudila kao kad je pokušala da se vrati u prošlost, njena strast je bila deseterostruka jer nije imala veze sa ovim svijetom jer je bila istinski sama... bez nade da će je itko doseći.<br/><br/>U svojim iracionalnim trenucima, mislila je da ju je Dragulj povukao i pronašla novi pakao u kojem će živjeti. To nije zaustavilo njene snove, vrijeme kada se probudila u noći jecajući, a ta sjećanja iz njene prošlosti su bila najteže nositi se s njima, najteže ih je zaboraviti. Srce joj je počelo juriti u panici dok se opet okretala u krevetu, dah joj je postao borba dok se borila protiv napada panike izazvanog njenim lutajućim umom ovako kasno u noć.<br/><br/>Mrzila je osjećaj slabosti i straha.<br/><br/>âTMa âTMa âTMa âTMa âTMa âTMa âTMa âTMa<br/><br/>Kagome se konačno izvukla iz kreveta, njena soba je osvijetljena blijedim svjetlom koje ju je dovoljno vodilo u kupaonicu, stajala je pred ogledalom, sudoperom koja je trčala dok je zurila u svoj odraz. Prvo jutro u Eliziji je bilo slično ovome, samo što je bila u gorem stanju.<br/><br/>- Pronašla je mjesto za spavanje, uspijevajući dogovoriti dogovor s vlasnikom zgrade kako bi joj omogućila da ostane u malom vremenskom periodu bez plaćanja. - Možda joj je Mirokuov utjecaj omogućio da sklopi takve dogovore, jer je redovnik bio poznat po načinu na koji je šarmantan (ili varao) ljude da im da više nego dovoljno za posao koji su obavili. On bi tvrdio da je prebivalište gospodara proganjalo kad to nije bilo ili tvrdio da su bili predmet napada kad nisu htjeli, prodavao bi svoje štićenike i šarme po tako visokim cijenama. Radilo je praktično svaki put i pitala se zašto su mu ljudi toliko voljni vjerovati.<br/><br/>Možda je to bio njegov osmijeh, ili činjenica da je bio redovnik da su ljudi iz prošlosti bili toliko spremni da se slome da nikada nije vrebao slabe, barem. On je uvijek činio ono što je ispravno i bio joj je simbol snage ponekad kada bi progurao sve kako bi učinio ono što je ispravno. Progurao je činjenicu da umire, da je proklet i pokušao je nešto poduzeti u vezi toga, umjesto da se koleba u svojoj sudbini. I bilo joj je drago što su porazili Narakua prije nego što je mogao postati podložan istoj sudbini kao i njegov otac, i njegov otac prije njega.<br/><br/>Bila je poštenija od svoje prijateljice i razumnija, sumnjala je da će bilo tko na svijetu platiti veliku cijenu za egzorcizam ili protjerivanje demona. Ali bila je dovoljno pametna i dovoljno pametna da napravi dobar dogovor.<br/><br/>Kagome je bila na boljem mjestu iako joj je izraz lica izgledao isto.<br/><br/>- Brzi pogled na sat na zidu joj je rekao da može duže da spava, ali je odustala od toga, ne želeći da se ponovo suoči sa flešbekovima. Ona se umjesto toga istuširala, koristeći hladnu vodu kako bi otjerala svoje demone, napunila pluća oštrim unosom zraka i prisilila se da se probudi.<br/><br/>♪ â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â<br/><br/>- Nije upalilo.<br/><br/>Hladna voda joj je silila zrak u pluća, natjerala um da se probudi i mišiće da zagrabi. Danas im nije htjela tako lako pobjeći, nije se htjela tako jednostavno oporaviti da bi se oporavila samo zato što je to htjela.<br/><br/>Ponekad ne možeš izbjegavati misli koje želiš, čak i kad si bio siguran da si ih prošao.<br/><br/>Ubojica demona joj je bio najbolji prijatelj, čak bi je i nazvala sestrom koju nikad nije imala, starijom sestrom koja je bila mudra, uvijek je imala svoju stranu kad bi se pojavila nevolja. Posebno dečačke nevolje, kada su takve stvari bile prilično trivijalne ali je bilo zabavno imati simpatiju i da njena prijateljica bude ljuta u njeno ime kada ju je Inuyasha rastužila. Na kraju krajeva, često je bilo da poludemon otrči na stranu njegove mrtve ljubavnice i slomi joj srce više puta.<br/><br/>Sango ju je također inspirirao na druge načine, nakon svega što se žena suočila, uvijek je bila tako jaka, tako sigurna... čak i u vrijeme u koje je sumnjala u sebe, uvijek se izvukla. Divila se tome što je imala sposobnost preživljavanja nakon što je izgubila cijelu obitelj -- podsjetnik na to često je tjerao Kagomea da preživi, jer je izgubila sve u ovom svijetu -- a onda je njen brat postao pijun Narakua. Nije bilo lako, nije moglo biti nešto s čim bi se svatko mogao suočiti i dalje ići naprijed s njom, i dalje se smiješila, čak i uz tu bol i te podsjetnike... često je bila tako svijetla, čak i u mračnija vremena.<br/><br/>Mislila je da će se Sango nekako izvući iz ovoga i ponuditi neke riječi snage i razumijevanja. - Ovakva vremena su pogoršala ove čini, stalni podsjetnik da je bila bez obitelji.<br/><br/>Ne želim biti sama. Plakala je naglas u samoći, zvuk tuša koji je utapao molbu.<br/><br/>- Nije se bojala priznati.<br/><br/>♪ â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â<br/><br/>Koža joj je bila hladna od vode i izgledalo je kao da joj led teče kroz vene, nije shvatila da je počela da drhti sve dok joj ruka nije posegnula da ugasi vodu i završi sa tuširanjem. Kagome više nije tražila sopstveni pogled u ogledalu, umesto toga, umotala se u peškire i izvukla se iz kupatila, uz stepenice i ušla u kuhinju. Počela je pripremati lagani doručak, čitajući svoje bilješke za dan dok se kuhala hrana.<br/><br/>Njene fotografije su bile u mnogim galerijama, njeno ime je počelo da se pojavljuje u mnogim usnama za one koji su bili zainteresovani za fotografiju.<br/><br/>Imala je više sreće nego što je očekivala na ovom svijetu, nikad dovoljno sreće da se vrati kroz pukotine u svoj svijet, ali dovoljno sretna da bude dobra. Kada se okrenula ka štednjaku, sjetila se vremena kada je konačno odustala od povratka kući. Bilo je to oko dvije godine njenog života ovdje, jer se počela upuštati u fotografiju kao nešto više od hobija, ali nešto čime je mogla napraviti ime za sebe.<br/><br/>Taj dan je bio posebno ugodan, sunce je bilo visoko na nebu i našla se na fotografiji prirodnog krajolika. - Dečak se sakrio u jednu od biljaka, i ona je uhvatila sliku trenutka kada mu se lice naselilo u veseo, nestašan osmeh trenutak pre nego što je iskočio da uplaši svoj plen. To ju je podsjetilo na Shippou, malu kitsune koju je, u biti, usvojila. - Dok je bio mlad, izgledao je tako zreo u njihovim prvim susretima.<br/><br/>Možda je Inuyashin utjecaj omogućio da se kit opet ponaša kao dijete, da ponekad bude mlad i hirovit dok je drugi zreliji. Ponudio joj je utjehu na svoj način, a ona se pokušala brinuti za njega kao što bi i ona htjela, iako je tada bila tako mlada, ali je mladost nije spriječila da shvati kako da se brine o njemu ili brine o njemu kao o svom djetetu. Bila je toliko ponosna na svaki crtež da je završio da je znala da će se majka tako osjećati u takvoj situaciji.<br/><br/>Promašila ga je i htjela je vidjeti koliko je narastao otkad je nestala.<br/><br/>Da bi se poštedila bola, lažnih nada, odustala je i usredsredila se na sebe.<br/><br/>- â TM s â TM s<br/><br/>Tek nakon što je završila shvatila je da je zaboravila na bilo kakve začine ili okus hrane. Bilo je prekasno da se toliko toga sjeti, jer joj je um bio prezauzet prisjećanjem na druge detalje njenog života koji su očito postali važniji od njene hrane.<br/><br/>\"Sjedi\"<br/><br/>Naravno, ništa se nije dogodilo kada je ljutito vikala na jednog posebno frustrirajućeg klijenta koji ju je podsjetio na poludemona. Inuyasha nije bila tako loša, ali Inuyasha je saznala prije nego što je bila prisiljena otići od njega. Postao je nježniji, razumniji, zreliji iako je još uvijek bio djetinjast i drzak.<br/><br/>Rekla mu je da odbija raditi za bilo koga ili bilo koga tko želi izvrnuti nešto izvan svoje prirode, izvan vlastitih želja.<br/><br/>Trebala ga je usporediti s Narakuom, a ne s Inuyashom, iako njen klijent nije imao tako ekstremne namjere. Sloboda saznanja da je došla tako daleko da je mogla odbiti posao koji nije željela raditi, biti sama, koja je bila neovisna o drugima, mogla je reći da je uspjela u tom trenutku. - Iako je čula glasine nekoliko dana kasnije sa riječima koje su je klevete.<br/><br/>Na kraju krajeva, ona je bila jedina koja je mogla da se zaštiti na ovom svetu.<br/><br/>- â TM s â TM s<br/><br/>Jutarnje svjetlo se počelo uvlačiti u njen dom, podsjećajući je opet na vrijeme, opet je razmatrala popis stvari koje je morala raditi i raspravljala o tome gdje početi, ili, ako uopće počne. Kako je dan počeo, nije znala da li to može smatrati sjajnom idejom, sumnjalo se da će biti uspješna u tome koliko je izgubljena u sebi.<br/><br/>Nije htela da upropasti svoj poslednji rad, jer je to radila nekoliko puta ranije, nije bilo prijatno pokušati da se oporavi od potpune katastrofe.<br/><br/>Kagome se sjetila osjećaja svoje skupe, potpuno nove kamere koja joj je klizila iz ruku. - Dramatičan, previsok, pun vrištanja koji je često radila kad je bila mnogo, mnogo mlađa, kada se borila da prođe kroz srednju školu dok skače između vremena. - Drugi dio nje je ostao zamrznut na mjestu dok joj se leća potpuno razbila, a ostatak kamere se pokvario zajedno s njom.<br/><br/>- Vidjevši Inuyashinog brata, punog demona, stojeći pred njom je bila zadnja stvar koju je očekivala kad je napravila izlaz za svoje fotografije. Njegovo ime na usnama bilo je toliko moćno da se sjeća najsitnijih osjećaja kao što je i ona. Usne su joj bile ispucale, usta su joj bila suha, a od mjehurića osjećaj tjeskobe u trbuhu joj je bilo muka.<br/><br/>- Nije htjela da joj nade budu gore.<br/><br/>Oni su bili saveznici, pošto su se borili rame uz rame, a nešto je bilo bolje nego apsolutno ništa.<br/><br/>Kagome je imala dovoljno pameti da se ne baci na njega, da ga zagrli u olakšanje što zna da nije sama. Ona se sjetila da ništa drugo nije bilo važno danima dok je provodila vrijeme s njim, ne govoreći o njihovom svijetu nego govoreći (ili, ona je govorila i on je jednostavno priznao tu činjenicu).<br/><br/>Kagome se nije mogla sjetiti, to je bila suptilna stvar, baš kao i on, ali znala je da je osjećaj tu, i dao joj je do znanja da nije sama u činjenici da je pala, da su osjećaji nekako procvjetali.<br/><br/>♪ â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â<br/><br/>Osjećaj bestežinskog bestežinskog stanja ju je obuzeo i iznenada su joj se oči otvorile dok joj je um očajnički kandžama grebao za posljednju stvar koju je radila. Nije se sjetila kad je zaspala na kauču, ali je znala da je zadnje mjesto gdje je bila bilo na preudobnim jastucima. Glava joj je bila nagnuta na Seshumaruove grudi, tješila se činjenicom da je on bio ovdje, a ona nije bila sama.<br/><br/>Nije morao puno govoriti o njoj da bi razumio njegovu namjeru, ili ostatak onoga što je imao za reći.<br/><br/>Ne, kad god je bio blizu, ona se nikada nije vratila u te misli. Pomogao je i godine su pomogle, a danas je to bio samo jedan od onih dana.<br/><br/>Zapovijedao je s lakoćom, njene oči su se kotrljale na njega ali se nije borila jer je bila umorna.<br/><br/>- Dobro sam. - Rekla je, njene riječi su čvrste sa njenim obećanjem.<br/><br/>Bila je dobro, bila je živa i sretna.<br/><br/>- â TM s â TM s<br/><br/>, brodar<br/><br/>sažetak<br/><br/>Kagome, u jednom trenutku njenog života, bila je prilično redovna tinejdžerka sve dok je nije napao demon unutar kuće njene obitelji, demon ju je odvukao u bunar, koji ju je magično prenio oko 500 godina u prošlost. Tamo je saznala da je sveti dragulj bio u njenom telu, jer je bila reinkarnacija svećenice koja je umrla 50 godina pre nego što je uvučena u nju. Dragulj je iščupan iz njenog tijela i demon koji ju je vukao kroz vrijeme je poražen od poludemona kojeg je oslobodila prikovanog za drvo. Kagome se sprijateljila s poludemonom, Inuyashom, s vremenom i otputovala s njim kako bi obnovila dragulj koji je ona, sama, razbila, iako nije bilo tako jednostavno i lako učiniti onoliko demona i ljudi su tražili dragulj za svoje potrebe. Sprijateljila se s mladim kitsune demonom, redovnikom i ubojicom demona koji su svi putovali s njom kako bi obnovili dragulj.<br/><br/>Umesto toga, zli poludemon koji je manipulisao većinom glavnih događaja u životu njene drugarice. Kada je konačno sakupio sve dijelove dragulja i zaželio želju na okaljanom predmetu, Kagome je uvučen u sam dragulj s namjerom da zaželi sebičnu želju da je zadrži zarobljenu unutra zauvijek, držeći dragulj na životu. Tvrdoglavost Inuyashe uspjela ju je spasiti od tame, na kraju se vratila u svoje prirodno vrijeme, završila srednju školu kao što se očekivalo od djevojke iz njenog vremenskog razdoblja, iako je Kagome nekoliko dana kasnije završila u Elysionu. Na ovom je svijetu već pet godina i odavno je odustala od povratka kući.<br/><br/>Platonski<br/><br/>Kagome je lako steći nove prijatelje, nije se puno promijenila od mladosti, vesela je mlada žena koja je suosjećajna i dočekuje najviše u životu, a u mladosti se sprijateljila s demonima kad bi ih se većina bojala. - Čak i demoni koji su nekada jeli ljude, ona se sprijateljila i promenila im puteve (želi da razmišlja). Ovo je rečeno, zaista je lako postati njen prijatelj sve dok neko može da pokaže da je spreman da se iskupi, ili da pokaže da nije potpuno zao. Veoma se osjeća prema svima koje upozna, pa joj je teško da ne bude privučena drugima u želji da budemo prijatelji.<br/><br/>, antagonist<br/><br/>Jedini način da zasluži Kagomeov gnjev je da bude tako žalosna, tako zla, i toliko daleko od iskupljenja da ne može vidjeti dobro u tebi i može vidjeti dobro u skoro svakome i svemu. Da, ne vidim da mrzi nikoga bez njih stvarno, stvarno radi za to. - Slobodno pokušajte.<br/><br/>romantičan<br/><br/>Kada je u ljubavi, Kagome je jaka podrška, uvijek ostaje tamo čak i kad stvari mogu biti grube. Međutim, Kagome ne traži ljubav, nije tražila ljubav kada je stigla da bi bilo kakve prošle veze ne postoje. Ona definitivno može biti predmet nečije neuzvraćene ljubavi, vjerojatno će biti nesvjesna toga, ali konačno, Kagome je trenutno zaručena za Seshoumarua, iznenađujuće.

Neptune se definitivno pokušava okružiti ljudima, jer voli imati prijatelje, a Kagome je i njegov tip? - kao da je slatka i jaka žena, a on je zapravo bolji prijatelj sa ženama nego što je sa muškarcima, idk zašto, on jednostavno voli biti okružen ženskim prijateljima koji znaju. Volim što su moji momci super dobri prijatelji i što iskreno štite svoje prijateljice, ali oh M A N i volim pseduo-obiteljske veze i Neptun je jedinac, tako da nije imao takve obiteljske veze.

Mnogo joj je teško jer se morala boriti protiv svoje rodne obitelji protiv svoje volje i zadnji put kad ih je vidjela, mrzili su je. Mislim da bi mogli biti prijatelji kao što je Corrin vrlo otvorena u svojoj osobnosti, iznimno povjerljiva kao i.

Znaš, ona je i pjevačica/izvođačica u lokalnom kazalištu tako da mogu zamisliti Kagomea kako ide tamo da pregleda stvari i onda uhvati Elsu iza pozornice ili tako nešto... i onda bi prijateljstvo moglo procvjetati odatle! Obožavam ideju da ovo dvoje provode kvalitetno bff vrijeme zajedno radeći male, ali zabavne stvari koje Elsa nikada nije doživjela kao dijete. |
| Why You Should be on Twitter<br/><br/>Disclaimer: I am not, nor have I ever claimed to be, a social media guru. I'm just a person who thinks about stuff a lot, and this has come up a number of times.<br/><br/>I'm not an early adopter. Sometimes it takes me years to figure out what I want to use something for before I actually get on it, and Twitter was one of those things. I've been on Twitter seriously since about February of this year, so I'm pretty new at it. Still, I've learned a number of things, and I wanted to share them. Some people say I'm a Twitter pusher, and I am, because there's lots of good reasons to get on it, and virtually no downsides.<br/><br/>So what's Twitter? If you're on the internet, you've probably at least heard of it. It's a social media network that serves as a forum for conversations, updates, and news in a medium more public than something like Facebook or LinkedIn. Facebook is about who wants to find you, but Twitter is about who you want to find. Your favourite writers, actors, politicians, singers, and scientists are probably on Twitter. So are your favourite charities, radio stations, news sites, and stores. And they want you to find them and listen to what they have to say. Everyone on Twitter, at least initially, wants to talk with you.<br/><br/>But why join that? Why be a part of it? There's all kinds of reasons, and I'm going to give you a few.<br/><br/>People and Places Twitter is a great way to find out about events which are going on around the world, but also in your community. If you're travelling and looking for things to do, it's a great way to find out about things relevant to your interests (because the people you follow are people you're interested in). Even if you're not travelling, knowing about great places to go locally or knowing that people you're interested in are going to them creates an opportunity to meet them and create a deeper relationship with them. If you go back to my party post, all the people in it but two, I heard about on Twitter and then met in real life, and now we're pretty good friends. And the more you do this, the more things you'll find out about, and the more people you'll meet. And if you follow them on Twitter, you already know a bit about what they're like. They want you to. The reverse is also true, because tweeting invites people to see what you're like, and they can make the same choices about you.<br/><br/>Inspiration and Motivation<br/>Inspiration comes from the strangest places, and the influx of tweets means there's always fresh content for your imagination. I have a follow first policy, so I'll follow just about anybody, and then periodically go through and unfollow people. I don't know who's going to plant the seed of a new blog post or new project in me, so I like to keep my options open. Motivation also happens, because Twitter is just like life. If you surround yourself with people who are ambitious, dedicated, generous, and hard-working, it's easier to be like that, and push yourself. It's easier to think that if they can plan events, launch projects, or just get up in the morning, well, so can you.<br/><br/>Learning and Lifestyle Bloggers are on Twitter. Bloggers who aren't may actually be crazy. And people blog about just about everything. If you're looking to learn something, odds are good that somebody's tweeting about it. On top of that, news services and stores are also connected, which means that you can get your news up to the minute, and find out about sales and deals as they start.As far as lifestyle, looking for new recipe ideas? Follow some caterers and see what they come up with. Need a twist for that cocktail party? Twitter's got people for that too. Wardrobe recommendations, or just want to see what other people are doing with their lives? It's all there.<br/><br/>There are some common challenges I face when talking about this, and they're legitimate obstacles. It can seem pretty daunting, especially if you're getting on the bandwagon late, like I did. I spent months following only two people and not knowing what else to do. But there are ways to overcome them, and hear they are from least frequent to most.<br/><br/>#3: Twitter is for Narcissistic Jerks<br/>I think this comes from the idea that most people tweet for and about themselves as a way of getting attention. What I don't get is why there's anything wrong with that, or why doing that makes one a narcissist or a jerk. If someone has something to say, they want to be heard. Used to be you'd stand on the street corner and yell. Now you can yell in 140 characters or less. Twitter's just a new way to be heard. Now, there are certainly narcissistic jerks on Twitter. They're pretty much everywhere. Sometimes, people are jerks. Sometimes one of those people is me, I'm sorry to say. Don't follow those people. If you don't like what someone is saying, whether that's points that they're making or detailed accounts of their bathroom activities, you don't have to listen on Twitter.<br/><br/>#2: I Can't Keep Track of It All<br/>The second obstacle people often bring up is that they just don't have time to keep track of all the things which are going on on Twitter. And you know what? That's fine. Keep track of what you can. Maybe you only wander on every few days. If you're a private user (rather than tweeting for your company), and especially a beginner, that's okay. Part of something is better than all of nothing.<br/><br/>#1 I've Got Nothing I Want to Put Out There<br/>This is by far the most frequent challenge people raise. And it doesn't even matter. You don't have to join Twitter to talk. Join it to listen. Again, your favourite authors, singers, bloggers, and newspapers are on here. This is your chance to listen to them. It's your chance to gain a window into their lives and activities, and they're inviting you to do that. Want to find out what Felicia Day is going to be up to at the San Diego Comic Con? Done. I know people who only listen on Twitter, and that's great. That's what I did for a while. Eventually, maybe you'll find something to tweet about, or make something to tweet about. I hope you do, because I want to hear about it.<br/><br/>In short, if you're not using Twitter, I think you should be. If you're not using it to its full extent, try to. Don't be afraid to follow five hundred people, if all of those people are saying things you're interested in. Invite those people into bits of your life, and see how it's improved by the interaction. I look forward to hearing from you. | Zašto bi trebao biti na Twitteru<br/><br/>Ja sam samo osoba koja puno razmišlja o stvarima, a ovo je iskrsnulo nekoliko puta.<br/><br/>Ponekad su mi potrebne godine da shvatim za šta želim da koristim nešto pre nego što se popnem na njega, a Tviter je bio jedna od onih stvari, ozbiljno sam na Tviteru od februara ove godine, pa sam prilično nov u tome. Neki ljudi kažu da guram Twitter, i jesam, jer postoji mnogo dobrih razloga da se na njemu, i praktično nema loših strana.<br/><br/>Ako ste na internetu, vjerojatno ste barem čuli za njega, to je društvena mreža koja služi kao forum za razgovore, ažuriranja i vijesti u srednje javnosti nego nešto poput Facebooka ili LinkedIn-a. Vaš omiljeni pisci, glumci, političari, pjevači i znanstvenici su vjerojatno na Twitteru, kao i vaše omiljene dobrotvorne organizacije, radio stanice, novinske stranice i trgovine. Svi na Twitteru, barem u početku, žele razgovarati s tobom.<br/><br/>Postoje razni razlozi, a ja ću ti dati nekoliko.<br/><br/>Ljudi i mjesta Twitter je odličan način da saznate o događajima koji se odvijaju širom svijeta, ali i u vašoj zajednici. Ako putujete i tražite stvari za raditi, to je odličan način da saznate o stvarima važnim za vaše interese (jer ljudi koje pratite su ljudi za koje ste zainteresirani). - Čak i ako ne putujete, znajući o sjajnim mjestima da idete lokalno ili znajući da ljudi za koje ste zainteresirani odlaze k njima stvara priliku da ih upoznate i stvorite dublji odnos s njima. Ako se vratiš na moj party post, svi ljudi u njemu osim dva, čuo sam na Twitteru i onda sam se upoznao u stvarnom životu, i sada smo prilično dobri prijatelji, i što više radiš ovo, više stvari ćeš saznati o tome, i više ljudi ćeš upoznati. I ako ih pratiš na Twitteru, već znaš ponešto o tome kakvi su, oni to žele, i obrnuto je istina, jer tweeting poziva ljude da vide kakav si, i oni mogu napraviti iste odluke o tebi.<br/><br/>- Inspiracija i motivacija<br/>Nadahnuće dolazi iz najčudnijih mjesta, a priliv tvitova znači da uvijek postoji svjež sadržaj za vašu maštu. Ne znam tko će usaditi sjeme novog bloga ili novog projekta u mene, pa volim imati otvorene opcije. - Ako se okružiš ljudima koji su ambiciozni, predani, velikodušni i marljivi, lakše je biti takav i gurati se. - Lakše je misliti da ako mogu planirati događaje, pokrenuti projekte, ili samo ustati ujutro, pa, možeš i ti.<br/><br/>Blogeri koji zapravo nisu ludi, a ljudi blogiraju o svemu, ako želite nešto naučiti, šanse su dobre da netko tweetuje o tome. - Povrh toga, novinske usluge i trgovine su također povezane, što znači da možete dobiti svoje vijesti do minute, i saznati o prodaji i poslovima kao što su početak. Tviter ima ljude i za to, preporuke za garderobu, ili samo žele da vide šta drugi ljudi rade sa svojim životima?<br/><br/>To može izgledati prilično zastrašujuće, pogotovo ako kasno ulaziš u bandwagon, kao što sam i ja. Proveo sam mjesece prateći samo dvoje ljudi i ne znajući što drugo učiniti, ali postoje načini da ih prevladam, i čujem da su od najmanje čestih do većine.<br/><br/>#3: Twitter je za narcisoidne kretene<br/>Mislim da to dolazi iz ideje da većina ljudi tvituje za i o sebi kao način da privuku pažnju. Sada možete vikati u 140 znakova ili manje, Twitter je samo novi način da se čuje, a sada, sigurno postoje narcisoidni kreteni na Twitteru. Ponekad su ljudi kreteni, ponekad sam jedan od tih ljudi ja, žao mi je što to moram reći. - Ako vam se ne sviđa što netko govori, bilo da je to točka da oni čine ili detaljne račune svojih kupaonica aktivnosti, ne morate slušati na Twitteru.<br/><br/>#2: Ne mogu sve pratiti<br/>Druga prepreka koju ljudi često pominju je da nemaju vremena da prate sve stvari koje se dešavaju na Twitteru. Ako ste privatni korisnik (umjesto tweetinga za svoju tvrtku), a posebno početnik, to je u redu.<br/><br/>#1 Nemam ništa što želim da iznesem tamo<br/>Ovo je najčešći izazov koji ljudi podižu, a nije ni važno, ne morate se pridružiti Twitteru da biste razgovarali, pridružite mu se da biste ga slušali, opet su tu vaši omiljeni autori, pjevači, blogeri i novine. To ti je prilika da im uneseš prozor u živote i aktivnosti, a oni te pozivaju da to učiniš, želiš saznati što će Felicia Day raditi na San Diego Comic Conu? Na kraju ćeš možda naći nešto o čemu ćeš tweetati, nadam se da hoćeš, jer želim čuti o tome.<br/><br/>Ukratko, ako ne koristite Twitter, mislim da biste trebali biti, ako ga ne koristite u punoj mjeri, pokušajte. -Pozovi te ljude u djeliće svog života, i vidi kako se poboljšava interakcijom. |
| Root Canals<br/><br/>The very thought of getting a root canal puts most people on edge. SCM Dental utilizes the latest technology and technique to make a root canal a virtually pain free and low stress procedure.<br/><br/>Rotary endodontics is an advanced technology and technique to perform endodontic treatment, the clinical term for a root canalThe term "root canal" refers to the natural cavity at the center of the tooth. The tooth's nerve is located in soft tissue (pulp) inside the root canal. If the tooth is damaged either by trauma or decay, debris can enter the sensitive root canal area and cause an infection, or in extreme circumstances, and abscess. An abscessed tooth is very serious and should be treated as an emergency, as it can create an infection that may spread to other parts of the body. If you believe you have an abscessed tooth, contact our office immediately to schedule emergency care.<br/><br/>Depending on the case, root canal therapy may require more than one visit. An initial x-ray will be taken to evaluate the tooth and root canal and determine the extent of the damage and infection if present. You will be given a form of anesthesia to make you relaxed.<br/><br/>When the area is numb, our dentist will create an access chamber to the root canal using an electric handpiece. Next, the root canal will be scraped of the infected or damaged tissue and nerve. Once the entire area has been throughly cleaned and polished, the tooth will be filled with a biocompatible rubber compound called gutta percha. The tooth is then covered with a dental filling or dental crown to restore strength and function.<br/><br/>Endodontic therapy has a bad reputation as being a painful procedure. With rotary endodontics, a root canal procedure is no more painful than having a dental filling placed. The infection and damage to the nerve is what creates the extreme pain and discomfort and patients you will experience significant relief after undergoing root canal therapy. Root canals have a success rate of 95% and allow people to preserve their natural teeth. | Root Canals<br/><br/>- Sama pomisao na dobivanje korijenskog kanala stavlja većinu ljudi na rub.

| Churchyard Bottom Wood<br/><br/>Highgate<br/><br/>Churchyard Bottom Wood, Highgate<br/><br/>Now called Queen's Wood<br/><br/>Between 1860 and 1880 the centre was torn out of the City of London to build sewers, railways and new roads. Houses were demolished without regard for the tenants who had to find whatever accommodation they could elsewhere. Managers went to livo in Kensington and St. John's Wood, while the poorest crowded into the rookeries like Seven Dials and Lisson Grove. For those between, the clerks and skilled workmen, speculative builders put up row after row of terraced villas and Mr Pooter moved into Holloway. The people of Muswell Hill watched houses creep across the fields of Finsbury Park, up Crouch Hill and down the other side, so that by 1880, Crouch End was being developed and there seemed no way to stem the flow. Ten years later the large estates of Muswell Hill were being sold. Upton Farm was sold and the Ecclesiastical Commissioners wanted to develop Churchyard Bottom Wood, now called Queen's Wood. The story would have made an Ibsen play. Two groups of honest, highly motivated people fighting for what they each thought was right. The Ecclesiastical Commissioners on the one hand and the Committee of the Hornsey Charities on the other, both believed they were doing their best for other people, and the public rose against them both in indignation<br/><br/>At that time Muswell Hill Road was a country road, with Southwood Hall at one end and Upton Farm at the other. By 1894, Onslow Gardens was built, Connaught Gardens marked out, and builders were poised to develop the Woodlands estate. Cut out of Churchyard Bottom Wood was a group of tumble-down cottages, on a triangular site. An undated map, held by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners shows six Wasteland Cottages with an opening between them - not a road, not metalled, but a way through to the strawberry beds behind. Further along was another gap which led to footpaths through the wood. These two openings were to be the basis of the plan. The same two gaps and the cleared ground, which was the strawberry field, can be seen in the 1894 map below. They are shown as 'Muswell Hill Cottages' and, quite in passing, Peter Sellers was to live on the same site much later on. To develop the wood as a housing estate, the Commissioners needed to drive two roads through from Muswell Hill Road and build houses along them. The Muswell Hill Road frontage alone would not have provided room for enough houses to make the venture worthwhile.<br/><br/>The land and cottages had been given much earlier as almshouses to house old people and were held on their behalf by the Trustees of the Hornsey Charity Commissioners. By the 1890s the cottages were tumble-down, in need of major repair. Public-spirited, wishing to do the best for their old tenants, the Trustees could not improve them since they had no money. Some years before the Ecclesiastical Commissioners had planned to develop Gravel Pit Wood (now Highgate Wood) as a housing estate, but this had met such opposition that they backed down. Instead, in 1886, they gave all 69 acres woodland to the public. At the same time they offered to sell Churchyard Bottom Wood to Hornsey Urban District Council for £25,000, but this was too much for Hornsey to raise on its own. The Council said that people living outside Hornsey also enjoyed the wood and other authorities should help, but no help was given. In the end the offer fell into abeyance.<br/><br/>Map showing the Muswell Hill Cottages which were the centre of the controversy.<br/><br/>Muswell Hill Road about 1880<br/><br/>It seems probable that these three pairs of cottages<br/>were the ones at the centre of the dispute.<br/><br/>The Ecclesiastical Commissioners wanted to raise money for its church work in Britain and abroad. They considered that they had been given the land to be used for the propogat­ion of religion and if this meant selling off land or woods, it was a lesser evil than restricting the work of the church. They had given Gravel Pit Wood to the public: in its place they would develop Churchyard Bottom Wood.<br/><br/>The Trustees of the Hornsey Charities wanted to produce an income to help their poor people, so they made an offer to the Commissioners. Their triangular piece of land was too awkwardly shaped to be developed economically, but if the Commissioners would grant them some more land to make it into a square site, they would build twenty-five neat villas. These would bring in ground rents of £225 per annum, which could be used to relieve the poverty of Hornsey people. In return they would permit the Commission­ers to cut two roads through their land so that the Commissioners could develop the woods.<br/><br/>When this offer became known people immediately reacted with alarm.<br/><br/>On the 16th December 1893 Mr Carvell Williams MP asked in the House of Commons, if the Ecclesiastical Commissioners had consented to sell a strip of land to the Hornsey Charities Trustees on condition that an existing road be widened to 40 feet, whether this was a preliminary to a building scheme and if the House of Parliament would have an opportunity to express an opinion.<br/><br/>Mr Leveson Gower, a Church Estates Commissioner replied',"Yes" to the first part.<br/><br/>Mr Carvell Williams, "Do I understand it is the intention to destroy that portion of Highgate Woods by building on it?"<br/><br/>Two days later The Star published an article worthy of any modern tabloid.<br/><br/>The Star<br/>18th December 1893<br/><br/>'Parliament must keep a keen watch on those old vandals and confederates of the jerry-builder the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. They are always alienating some piece of land or are favouring the builders as opposed to the general public. The Commissioners would not sell the Churchyard Bottom wood to the ratepayers but now propose 'to open it up' by cutting two wide roads through it in connection with one of their numerous building schemes. Will not someone ask a question in Parliament and check the brick and mortar policy of the Commissioners?'<br/><br/>By the time this was printed, the question had been asked and the answer was either untrue, or devious. Other papers took up the story. The Times, in a long report, said that the Comnussioners were not prepared to give an undertaking that Parliament, or any other public body, should have an opportunity of considering any scheme for building on the site of the wood.<br/><br/>The situation simmered for eighteen months until the Ecclesiastical Commissioners were forced to open an enquiry, which began at Highgate on 31 May 1895, chaired by an Assistant Ecclesiastical Commissioner. The Inquiry produced a flurry of newspaper letters of which this was the most important.<br/><br/>The Daily Chronicle, 5 June 1895<br/><br/>VANDALISM AT HIGHGATE<br/><br/>Sir –<br/><br/>One of the most lovely bits of woodland in suburan London is threatened. Will you help us to ward off what would be a calamity, not only to the immediate district, but to the whole of densely-populated North London? In no part of the metropolis has the builder been more active than in Crouch End and Hornsey. The beautiful meadows of a year or two ago are now houses and shops. Ballast heaps have taken the place of stately elms and chestnuts, and once pleasant villages are sharing the fate of Stroud Green, Harringay, Finsbury Park, Highbury and Islington. ---<br/><br/>---- The object is the construction of two forty-foot roads through the woods. We in this district know the meaning of forty-foot roads through woods. It means that the woods are doomed. Ten years ago agitation saved the sister-wood of sixty-five acres - The Gravel Pit Woods - and no one who saw the Bank Holiday crowds flocking up the Archway Road from the dreary streets of Holloway, Islington and Clerkenwell, and watched the keen enjoyment of the children and family parties picnicking on the grass and among the trees, could fail to realise the immense boon that the grant by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners of this wood has been to the whole of North London, but the Lower Wood of sixty acres has always been regarded as a natural complement of the other. ----<br/><br/>--- The Ecclesiastical Commissioners own nearly one-third of the large parish of Hornsey. By the liberal expenditure of the ratepayers' money in the opening up of roads and the general development of the district, the value of their property has been enormously increased, and from this unearned increment they each year draw large revenues. Surely the ratepayers whose money has thus aided in creating the immense estate may expect liberal treatment in return. ---<br/><br/>Yours obediently,<br/><br/>Signed by The Vicar of St James', Muswell Hill, the Minister of Park Chapel, Crouch End, a barrister living in Onslow Gardens and three members of the District Council.<br/><br/>It was a shot right across the bows of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. Their own religious leaders and the District Council, all up in arms saying in effect that the church was too rich and should be charitable, not greedy. The inclusion of the two clergymen was a shrewd move. Remember to that this was still in the height of the Darwin controversy. Darwin had split belief in the teachings of the Church and many people would have resented the power of the Church from that point of view alone. The Church was not so secure as it pretended to be.<br/><br/>The Evening News, 7 June 1895 said:-<br/><br/>"If the Ecclesiastical Comnussioners are not tackled at once, the building octopus will get a grip of the wood which will be very difficult to loosen later on, ---. Therefore it behoves Londoners to be up and doing if they would save one of their most delightful bits of rustic scenery. The public inquiry stands adjourned to Thursday next, and before then something must be done to convince the Commissioners that the citizens of London will not tolerate the confiscation of one of their favourite playgrounds."<br/><br/>A letter in the Daily Chronicle the next day said:-<br/><br/>.... It was with great relief that that the residents, some ten years ago, heard that the purchase of the Upper Wood had been effected; and how delightful a boon this has proved, anyone who visited them can testify, but all who exerted themselves to save these upper woods, which lie on the west side of Muswell Hill road, felt that their victory was incomplete so long as the sixty acres on the east side remained in danger. It is, as it were, an accident that the woods are divided by a broad high road. Can anyone doubt what the effect would be if the Churchyard Bottom Wood were replaced by rows of small villas, each sending out its contribution of smoke and soot? Can anyone doubt, too, the serious difference it would make to the picturesque setting of the purchased woods if a line of staring new houses were to be run up right over against their leafy frontage?'<br/><br/>This expressed the opinions of many people. In fact, the Gravel Pit Wood, which the writer calls the 'Upper Wood', had not been purchased, but given to the district by the Ecclesiastical Commission, a point they were to reiterate time and again over the years, but most people ignored it. The Commission was not going to give away a second wood whatever anyone said, and held this position to the end.<br/><br/>H.S.Chamberlain, of 5 Cranley Gardens,<br/>in a letter to the Times dated June 8, 1895, urged purchase.<br/><br/>I know that it is common to speak harshly of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, but as the trustees of a fund they are bound to administer it to the greatest advantage, and therefore, if anything is to be done to save the demolition of the wood, it appears to me that it can only be effected by the purchase of the property from the Comnussioners, who I know, are fully alive to the protection of free and open spaces for the people, and who, I feel sure, would be disposed to treat the matter of a purchase in a free and liberal spirit, as they have already done in the matter of the Shepherd's Cot-field, by granting a lease to the Crouch End Playing-fields Company - a small company in which I own a few shares, a small company which was formed exclusively for the purpose of securing the fields for cricket, tennis etc.<br/><br/>(This refers the the Crouch End Playing Fields which had been secured a few years later.)<br/><br/>As Chairman of the Muswell Hill Conservative Association, I am constantly in touch with the inhabitants, and I can safely affirm that every person resident in the neighbourhood would do anything in reason to preserve.<br/><br/>(All he wanted personally was Charity income to support his poor people. He demanded his acre of land - not a great deal surely - he believed the Commissioners' assurance that the wood was not in danger.)<br/><br/>' Muswell Hill Road was one of the best in Hornsey and would remain equally beautiful, houses or no houses',<br/><br/>(and then came the great rhetorical flourish.)<br/><br/>'Are the poor to suffer because of the sentimental objections and the hysterical cry of 'wolf just raised by your correspondents? Something must be done and that soon. An acre of back-land added to the charity-estate would make no apprec­iable difference to the land remaining, while the profit derived from it would succour many poor old and deserving persons in their declining years and enable us to hand over to our successors an estate which in the distant future would be of great value in the rendering of charitable aid to the deserving poor of the parish of Hornsey.'<br/><br/>Reading his letter one senses hysteria very near the surface. Why did he think the Commissioners wanted to build a road? Why should they spend all that money if not to build houses? He never seemed to realise that for an acre of land the the whole wood would be lost. But he had been with the problem for a long time. He was the person to whom the Commissioners had made the offer of sale for £25,000 years before and it is his name which is honoured in a plaque on Crouch End Clock Tower for saving the wood, but his trust in the Ecclesiastical Commissioners seems naive. It is sad that at the Inquiry he was to be cast as the devil.<br/><br/>The Inquiry Continued<br/><br/>The adjourned opened in Highgate on 15 June 1895. Expecting a large gather­ing, the Council Chamber had been changed completely. The usual tables had been removed and the room filled with chairs. By half past seven the room was crowded, with people jostling for seats.<br/><br/>Mr Murray, the Commissioner, said the Inquiry was really a simple one. Hornsey Parochial Charities wished to purchase a piece of land adjoining their charity property at the back. The question was whether the Charity Commission, which controlled all charities, had enough power to stop them. The Church Commissioners were prepared to sell the land at very favourable terms and the income of the Charity would be very considerable increased.<br/><br/>Against this there were three classes of objection.<br/><br/>The original Trust was for the purpose of providing cottages for the Poor, but the trustees were proposing to build villas which would be too expensive for the Poor. However, it was within the power of the Trustees to vary the terms of the Trust, so they could build villas if they thought that the Poor would benefit in the end. The poor people themselves might object, but liberal provisions had already been promised for them. The third objection related to the aesthetic and public side of the question. He took it from what he had read that the Charity Commission ought to interfere to prevent the Ecclesiastical Commissioners from exercising their own discretion in dealing with their own property.<br/><br/>The Inquiry discussed fine points, but the speakers kept coming back to the major problem of preventing any destruction of the wood. The Vestry Clerk of Islington, representing 300,000 people, made a formal protest about any part of the wood, so valuable for the people of Islington and Hornsey being used for private purposes. Mr Wilfred White said that if the Commissioners would give them time they would be able to raise the money to compensate the Trustees.<br/><br/>Mr Beaumont said they did not want villas, they wanted cottages for poor people who were being driven out of the district. Others said that there was no money to build cottages to replace the present delapidated ones but villas would be an economic proposition. Others retorted that there were score of villas to let in Highgate. The Wood was sacred. Stick to the question of the Wood.<br/><br/>Dr Fletcher said the cry among the working people was that there was nowhere to go. Working people came to him with the cry, "We are driven out of Highgate and are obliged to go to Highgate New Town." If the Muswell Hill Road frontage was sold there was no question but that roads might be cut right through the woods in the direction of Hornsey, but if the Commissioners could not get the land from the Charity Commission they could not cut the road.<br/><br/>He was very sure the cottages could be put into a fit state of repair. He was asked by the poor people, by the police and by a number of the working classes to represent these two points, that cottage accommodation was very sorely needed in Highgate and that if they once allowed the land to be sold, there was no telling where the hand of the builder would be stayed.<br/><br/>(Loud and prolonged cheers).<br/><br/>Numerous other people spoke and the Comnussioner summed up by saying that he took it that the prevailing opinion was in favour of retaining the cottages but the meeting should draw no conclusions from what he had said (Groans).<br/><br/>Others said that the Trustees of the Charity had failed in their duties by letting the the cottages fall into disrepair.<br/><br/>Mr H.R.Williams, the Trustee who had written to the paper earlier, said that he had it on the best authority that the Church Commissioners would make no roads whatever and they would not be benefitted one iota by the actions of the Charity Commissioners. Others were far less trusting and the meeting closed after nearly three hours.<br/><br/>'We are faced with the fact that in Highgate and Muswell Hill there are a number of persons who want the Churchyard Bottom Wood and will not be happy until they have got it - while nobody appears willing to spend a farthing to pay for it. Everyone says it would be a fine thing to have the wood as open space, but everybody thinks it is the duty of someone else to make it one. The Islington Vestry has 'resolved' on the subject, but the Islington Vestry does not offer a penny piece towards the purchase. --- There is no more difficult problem for the community or the individual to solve than how to gain possession of other people's property without paying for it.'<br/><br/>Paying for it was indeed the problem as Churchyard Bottom Wood became the subject of intense local and national debate. A joint committee was formed to raise money to save the wood. On 20 November 1896, C.F.Cory-Wright, Hon Treasurer, wrote to The Standard, a daily paper at that time, appealing for help. He reminded everyone of the danger of losing the wood and said it could only be saved by buying it. The Church Commissioners would sell for £25,000 and an extra (5,000 would be required for fencing and drainage, making a total of £30,000. This was too much for Hornsey Council to raise but they had already voted £10,000 towards the total. The woods were of inestimable value to all of North London so he appealed to public bodies and private people to raise the remaining £20,000. He warned that the present offer from the Church Commissioners was open only to the end of 1898. After that the builders would move in.<br/><br/>The appeal was warmly welcomed by the press. A Private Bill was rushed through Parliament and the Highgate Woods Preservation Act, 1897, became law. The Conunittee now had the right to advertise for contributions towards buying the Wood and preserving it.<br/><br/>In a fairly short time almost all the money was raised, but the last few thousand proved very difficult to raise and the Commissioners' deadline was a matter of weeks away. Mr Cory-Wright wrote pleading for more time but was granted a mere three months and then only if interest at 4 per cent was paid for the extra period on the full sum. In the end the London County Council, which had originally offered £2,500, made this up to £5,000 and the total was reached, but it was a close-run thing.<br/><br/>The Council decided to re-name the Wood as 'Queen's Woods' in honour of Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee and Hornsey put on a fine display of bunting when the Duchess of Albany formally declared the Wood open 'for the free use of the public for ever'.<br/><br/>While the campaign to save Churchyard Bottom Wood was run and directed by local people who felt passionately about this particular piece of woodland, they called on the help and experience of a vast network of people, some of whom had worked together on similar campaigns for over thirty years. The Committee issued an appeal, printed on very good quality paper and bearing some famous names.<br/><br/>The questions of open space and public health were major subjects of the Victorian vision.<br/><br/>The Open Spaces Movement<br/><br/>Octavia Hill, the great housing reformer, who had begun with three old houses in Marylebone, bought for her by Jolm Ruskin, had quickly become an expert on housing poor people in the healthiest conditions possible. Her way was to buy leases and then knock down some of the crowded houses in order to bring light and air to the rest, believing that fresh air and sunlight were the the only way poor people could be saved from 'putrid fever. She had learnt this as a child from her grandfather, Southwood Smith, who developed his theories at the Fever Hospital at King's Cross.<br/><br/>He had built the first Industrial Dwellings for poor people and had proved statistically that good air and decent drainage saved lives. Gibson Gardens, in Northwold Road, is a direct outcome of Southwood Smith's ideas. More Information on Gibson Gardens<br/><br/>The Importance of Open Air<br/><br/>Open spaces and the opportunity to breathe clean air, were essential for people living in one or two crowded rooms. Octavia Hill took her charges from the Lisson Grove slums, up Fitzjohn's Avenue to Hampstead Heath. She so loved the Fitzjohn's Avenue fields that she tried to buy them as a public park. They were to cost £10,000 and within three August weeks £8,500 had been raised. It needed only the end of the summer holidays and the return from holiday of sympathetic friends and the further £1,500 would have been raised, but the owners suddenly withdrew their offer. Despite all pleading, the fields were covered with large houses.<br/><br/>From this developed the campaign to save Parliament Hill, the next open space northwards from Lisson Grove, buying up fields in the path of the builders to make a permanent cordon sanitalre against the advancing bricks. The Parliament Hill Fields campaign was so successful that the Hampstead Heath Bill was passed and there was money over from the appeal. From this money and the impetus towards open spaces, was to develop the National Trust. Octavia Hill had been interested in protecting areas like Church Bottom Wood for years, so she was a natural ally in the fight to save the Wood.<br/><br/>The Commons Preservation Society also, was familiar with this kind of agitation and money collection. They had torn down fencing when lords of the manor had enclosed pieces of common land, leading both legal and illegal battles against the arrogant privatization of land traditionally free. Robert Hunter, their Honorary Solicitor from 1868, was always concerned with securing open spaces, large or small, for the public. He, now Sir Robert Hunter, became the Chairman of the Church Bottom Appeal. The Chairman of the Commons Preservation Society was Mr Shaw-Lefevre MP (later Lord Eversley) who played a big part in this and other campaigns in the House of Commons. Octavia Hill had been involved in their work from about 1875.<br/><br/>At the same time Octavia Hill was campaigning for a Burials Bill.<br/><br/>City churchyards had become so full and such a serious a hazard to health, by contaminating wells from which people drew their drinking water, that City burials were no longer permitted. Instead, cemetries were created on the outskirts of town. Abney Park Cemetary was one of these. There was then a movement to remove the headstones to the edges of the old town cemetries, re-inter the bodies elsewhere and turn the cemetries into gardens and open spaces, instead of building on them. This land in the centre of London was very valuable and speculators were avid to obtain it: Even the Quakers had built over one of their cemetries and threatened to do so again by building over Bunhill Fields. Octavia Hill had a network of allies in a dozen fields, so her help to save the Church Bottom Wood must have been invaluable.<br/><br/>The Metropolitan Gardens Society, set up in 1882, had laid out about two hundred small gardens in city centres by 1890. They later handed them over to the Local Authorities, so their support for the Churchyard Bottom Wood Appeal was assured from the start.<br/><br/>The Kyrle Society is forgotten now, but in its day had great influence on Town Planning and Open Space legislation. The Society had been set up about 1875 for 'the Diffusion of Beauty', to bring colour and interest into the lives of people living in dull, drab surroundings. Bright colour to walls and decoration, good singing, open spaces, Nature, Literature and Art. All these fell within the Society's remit. There was a Decorative Branch, for whom William Morris lectured; a Musical Branch to promote choirs and Happy Evenings for people in local school buildings; and a Literature Branch. The Society appealed regularly by letters in The Times, to 'the richer classes' for books and periodicals to be distributed to boys' and girls' clubs, almshouses and elsewhere. However the Open Spaces Committee was the most active. The very name 'Kyrle' came from Pope's The Man of Ross, the philanthropist who gave his birthplace to the people as a public park. | \"Crkveno dvorište\" \"Dno drveta\"<br/><br/>Visoka kapija<br/><br/>crkveno dvorište Dno Drvo, Visoka kapija<br/><br/>Sada se zove Kraljičina šuma<br/><br/>U periodu od 1860. do 1880. centar je iščupan iz Londona radi izgradnje kanalizacije, željeznice i novih cesta. Kuće su srušene bez obzira na stanare koji su morali pronaći bilo koji smještaj na drugom mjestu. - Menadžeri su otišli u Livo u Kensingtonu i St. John's Woodu, dok su najsiromašniji bili prepuni u rookerijima kao što su Seven Dials i Lisson Grove. Za one između, činovnike i vješte radnike, spekulativne graditelje koji postavljaju red za redom terasastih vila i g. Pooter se preselio u Holloway. Stanovnici Muswell Hilla gledali su kako se kuće gmižu preko polja Finsbury Parka, uz Crouch Hill i niz drugu stranu, tako da se do 1880. godine Crouch End razvijao i činilo se da nema načina da se zaustavi tok. Deset godina kasnije prodana su velika imanja Muswell Hilla, prodana je farma Upton, a povjerenici Ecclesiastical Commissioners htjeli su razviti crkveno dvorište Bottom Wood, koje se sada zove Queen's Wood. dve grupe poštenih, veoma motivisanih ljudi koji se bore za ono što svaki od njih misli da je ispravno. \"Ekklesijastički povjerenici s jedne strane i Odbor Hornsey milosrđa s druge strane, obojica su vjerovali da daju sve od sebe za druge ljude, a javnost se digla protiv njih oboje u ogorčenju\"<br/><br/>U to vrijeme Muswell Hill Road je bio seoski put, sa Southwood Hallom na jednom kraju i Upton Farmom na drugom. 1894. izgrađen je Onslow Gardens, Connaught Gardens označen, a graditelji su bili spremni razviti Woodlands imanje. - Izrezano iz crkvenog dvorišta Dno Drvo je bila grupa kotlića, na trouglastom mjestu. - Nedatirana karta, koju drže Eklesijastički povjerenici pokazuje šest Koliba s pustom zemljom s otvorom između njih - ne cesta, ne metalizirana, već put do kreveta s jagodama iza. Ova dva otvora trebala su biti osnova plana, ista dva otvora i očišćeno tlo, koje je bilo polje jagoda, mogu se vidjeti na mapi ispod 1894. Oni su prikazani kao 'Muswell Hill Cottages' i, sasvim u prolazu, Peter Sellers je trebao živjeti na istom mjestu mnogo kasnije. Kako bi se drvo razvilo kao stambeno imanje, povjerenici su morali voziti dvije ceste od Muswell Hill Roada i graditi kuće uz njih. Muswell Hill Road frontage sama ne bi imala dovoljno prostora za kuće da bi se taj pothvat isplatio.<br/><br/>Zemlja i vikendice su date mnogo ranije kao milosrdne kuće za kuće starih ljudi i držane su u njihovo ime od strane Povjerenika Hornsey dobrotvornih povjerenika. 1890-ih vikendice su bile srušene, u potrebi za velikim popravkom. Javnodušni, želeći učiniti najbolje za svoje stare stanare, Povjerenici ih nisu mogli poboljšati jer nisu imali novca. Nekoliko godina prije nego što su Eklesijastički povjerenici planirali razviti Šljuncanu jamsku šumu (sada Highgate Wood) kao stambeno imanje, ali to je susrelo takvu opoziciju da su se povukli. - U isto vrijeme ponudili su da prodaju crkveno dvorište Bottom Wood Hornsey Urban District Council za 25 000 funti, ali ovo je bilo previše za Hornseya da sama podigne. Vijeće je reklo da ljudi koji žive izvan Hornseya također uživaju u drvu i druge vlasti bi trebale pomoći, ali nikakva pomoć nije data.<br/><br/>- Karta koja prikazuje Muswell Hill Cottages koji su bili središte kontroverze.<br/><br/>- Muswell Hill Road oko 1880.<br/><br/>Čini se vjerojatno da su ova tri para vikendica bile u središtu spora.<br/><br/>- Eklesijastički povjerenici htjeli su prikupiti novac za crkveni rad u Britaniji i inozemstvu. Smatrali su da im je zemlja dana da se koriste za propogatni ion religije i ako je to značilo prodaju zemlje ili šume, to je manje zlo od ograničavanja rada crkve. Oni su javnosti dali Šljuncanu jamu Drvo: na njenom mjestu razvijali bi crkveno dvorište Dno Drvo.<br/><br/>Povjerenici Hornsey Charities htjeli su proizvesti prihod kako bi pomogli svojim siromašnim ljudima, pa su dali ponudu povjerenicima. - Njihov trokutasti komad zemlje bio je previše nezgodno oblikovan da bi se gospodarski razvijao, ali ako bi im povjerenici dali još malo zemlje da bi ga pretvorili u četvrtasto mjesto, izgradili bi dvadeset i pet urednih vila. One bi donijele najamnine od 225 funti godišnje, koje bi se mogle koristiti za ublažavanje siromaštva ljudi iz Hornseyja. zauzvrat bi dozvolile Komisiji ers da presječe dvije ceste kroz njihovu zemlju kako bi povjerenici mogli razviti šume.<br/><br/>- Kada je ova ponuda postala poznata ljudi su odmah reagovali sa alarmom.<br/><br/>16. prosinca 1893. zastupnik g. Carvella Williamsa pitao je u Domu Commonsa, da li su Ecclesiastical Commissioners pristali prodati komad zemljišta poverenicima Hornsey Charities pod uvjetom da se postojeća cesta proširi na 40 stopa, da li je ovo preliminarna shema izgradnje i ako bi Parlament imao priliku izraziti mišljenje.<br/><br/>G. Leveson Gower, povjerenik za crkvena imanja odgovorio je na prvi dio.<br/><br/>G. Carvell Williams, razumijem li da je namjera uništiti taj dio Highgate Woodsa gradnjom na njemu<br/><br/>Dva dana kasnije The Star objavio je članak vrijedan bilo kojeg modernog tabloida.<br/><br/>Zvezda<br/>- 18. prosinca 1893.<br/><br/>Parlament mora dobro paziti na te stare vandale i konfederacije graditelja jerija Eklesijastičkih povjerenika, uvijek otuđuju neki komad zemlje ili favoriziraju graditelje za razliku od opće javnosti. Povjerenici ne bi prodali drvo donje crkveno dvorište ratepayerima ali sada predlažu 'da ga otvore' tako što bi kroz njega presijecali dvije široke ceste u vezi s jednom od njihovih brojnih građevinskih shema. Zar neće neko da postavi pitanje u Parlamentu i proveri politiku o ciglama i minobacačima komesara?<br/><br/>Dok je ovo bilo tiskano, pitanje je bilo postavljeno i odgovor je bio ili neistinit, ili neiskren. Times je, u dugom izvještaju, rekao da Comnussioneri nisu bili spremni dati pothvat koji Parlament, ili bilo koje drugo javno tijelo, trebaju imati priliku razmotriti bilo kakvu shemu za izgradnju na mjestu gdje se nalazi drvo.<br/><br/>- Situacija se zakuhala osamnaest mjeseci dok Eklesijastički povjerenici nisu bili prisiljeni otvoriti istragu, koja je započela u Highgateu 31. svibnja 1895. godine, kojom je predsjedao pomoćnik eklesijastičkog povjerenika. Upit je proizveo nalet novinskih pisama od kojih je ovo bilo najvažnije.<br/><br/>Dnevna kronika, 5. lipnja 1895.<br/><br/>Vandalizam na visokom nivou<br/><br/>* Gospodine *<br/><br/>Hoćete li nam pomoći da odstranimo ono što bi bila nesreća, ne samo neposrednoj četvrti, već i čitavom gusto naseljenom sjevernom Londonu? Ni u jednom dijelu metropole graditelj nije bio aktivniji nego u Crouch Endu i Hornseyu. Balastne gomile zauzele su mjesto uzvišenih brijestova i kestena, a nekad ugodna sela dijele sudbinu Strouda Greena, Harringaya, Finsbury Parka, Highburyja i Islingtona.<br/><br/>Mi u ovom okrugu znamo značenje 40-metarskih puteva kroz šumu, što znači da su šume osuđene na propast. Pre deset godina agitacija je spasla sestru-drvo od šezdeset pet jutara - Šljuncana jama Woods - i niko ko je video gomilu praznika u banci kako hrli uz Arhvej Roud iz turobnih ulica Holoveja, Islingtona i Klerkenvela, i niko ko je video da se deca i porodične zabave naviknu na travu i među drvećem, ne bi mogao da shvati neizmernu boon da je donacija od strane Eklesijastičkih komesara ovog drveta bila za ceo Severni London, ali Donje drvo od šezdeset hektara uvek smatrano prirodnim dopunom drugih. - ----<br/><br/>--- Eklesijastički povjerenici posjeduju gotovo jednu trećinu velike župe Hornsey. - Liberalnim izdacima novca otplaćivača u otvaranju cesta i općem razvoju okruga, vrijednost njihove imovine je enormno povećana, a iz tog nezasluženog povećanja oni svake godine izvlače velike prihode. Sigurno, oni kojima je novac pomogao u stvaranju ogromnog imanja mogu zauzvrat očekivati liberalno postupanje.<br/><br/>- Vaš poslušno,<br/><br/>- Potpisao Vikar Svetog Jakova, Muswell Hill, ministar Park kapele, Crouch End, odvjetnik koji živi u Onslow Gardens i tri člana Oblasnog vijeća.<br/><br/>To je bio pucanj pravo preko pramca Eklesijastičkih povjerenika, njihovih vjerskih vođa i Oblasnog vijeća, koji su govorili da je crkva previše bogata i da treba biti dobrotvorna, a ne pohlepna. Uključivanje dvojice svećenika bio je lukav potez, sjetite se da je ovo još uvijek bilo u vrhuncu Darwinove kontroverze. Crkva nije bila tako sigurna kao što se pretvarala.<br/><br/>Večernje novosti, 7. lipnja 1895.<br/><br/>-Ako se ne obruše odmah, hobotnica iz zgrade uhvatit će drvo koje će kasnije biti vrlo teško opustiti. - Zato Londonci moraju biti budni i raditi ako bi sačuvali jedan od svojih najdivnijih dijelova rustikalnog krajolika. Javna istraga se raspušta do sljedećeg četvrtka, a prije toga nešto mora biti učinjeno kako bi se načelnici uvjerili da građani Londona neće tolerirati oduzimanje jednog od njihovih omiljenih igrališta.<br/><br/>U pismu u Dnevnoj kronici sljedećeg dana pisalo je:-<br/><br/>- .... Bilo je s velikim olakšanjem što su stanovnici, prije desetak godina, čuli da je kupovina Gornje šume bila učinjena; i kako je to bila divna blagodat, svatko tko ih je posjetio može svjedočiti, ali svi koji su se naprezali da spasu ove gornje šume, koje leže na zapadnoj strani ceste Muswell Hill, smatrali su da je njihova pobjeda nepotpuna sve dok 60 hektara na istočnoj strani ne ostane u opasnosti. Može li itko sumnjati kakav bi bio učinak ako bi crkveno dvorište Dno šume bilo zamijenjeno redovima malih vila, svaka bi slala svoj doprinos dimu i čađi? \"Može li itko također sumnjati u ozbiljnu razliku u slikovitom okruženju kupljene šume ako bi linija buljećih novih kuća bila pregažena ravno na njihovu lisnatu frontu?\"<br/><br/>- To je izrazilo mišljenja mnogih ljudi. Zapravo, Šljuncana jama Drvo, koju pisac naziva 'Vrhunska šuma', nije bila kupljena, ali je okrugu dala Eklesijastička komisija, tačka koju su trebali stalno ponavljati tijekom godina, ali većina ljudi ju je ignorirala. Komisija nije htjela odati drugo drvo, što god bilo tko rekao, i držala je ovaj položaj do kraja.<br/><br/>H.S.Chamberlain, od 5 Cranley Gardens, u pismu Timesu od 8. lipnja 1895. godine, pozvao je na kupnju.<br/><br/>Znam da je uobičajeno grubo govoriti o Ecclesiastical Commissioners, ali kao poverenici fonda oni su dužni da ga uvedu u najveću korist, i stoga, ako se išta treba učiniti kako bi se sačuvalo rušenje drveta, čini mi se da se to može postići samo kupovinom imovine od Comnussionersa, koji znam, su potpuno živi na zaštitu slobodnih i otvorenih prostora za ljude, i koji bi, osjećam se sigurnim, mogli biti odobreni da tretiraju stvar kupnje u slobodnom i liberalnom duhu, kao što su već učinili u slučaju Shepherd's Cot-fielda, odobravanjem zakupa Crouch End Playing-fields Company - male tvrtke u kojoj posjedujem nekoliko dionica, male kompanije koja je bila formirana isključivo u svrhu osiguranja polja za kriket.<br/><br/>- Ovo se odnosi na Crouch End Igrališta koja su bila osigurana nekoliko godina kasnije.)<br/><br/>Kao predsjedavajući Konzervativne asocijacije Muswell Hill, stalno sam u kontaktu sa stanovnicima, i mogu sa sigurnošću potvrditi da bi svaka osoba u susjedstvu učinila sve kako bi očuvala.<br/><br/>Zahtijevao je svoj hektar zemlje - ne mnogo sigurno - vjerovao je povjereničkom uvjeravanju da drvo nije u opasnosti.<br/><br/>Muswell Hill Road je bio jedan od najboljih u Hornseyju i ostao bi jednako lijep, kuće ili bez kuća.<br/><br/>- (a onda je došao veliki retorički procvat.)<br/><br/>Da li siromašni pate zbog sentimentalnih primedbi i histeričnog povika vuka koji su upravo podigli vaši dopisnici? Akvarij zemlje koja je dodana u dobrotvorne svrhe ne bi napravio nikakvu značajnu razliku prema preostalom zemljištu, dok bi profit dobiven iz nje pomogao mnogim siromašnim starim i zaslužnim osobama u njihovim opadajućim godinama i omogućio nam da predamo našim nasljednicima imanje koje bi u dalekoj budućnosti bilo od velike vrijednosti u pružanju dobrotvorne pomoći zaslužnim siromašnima župe Hornsey.'<br/><br/>Zašto je mislio da povjerenici žele graditi cestu, zašto bi trošili sav taj novac ako ne da bi gradili kuće? On nikada nije shvatio da će za hektar zemlje čitavo drvo biti izgubljeno, ali bio je sa problemom dugo vremena. On je bio osoba kojoj su povjerenici dali ponudu prodaje za 25 000 funti prije i to je njegovo ime koje je počašćeno u plaketi na Crouch End Clock Toweru zbog spašavanja drva, ali njegovo povjerenje u Ecclesiastical Commissioners čini se naivno. - Tužno je što je u istrazi trebao biti bačen kao vrag.<br/><br/>Upit se nastavlja<br/><br/>Raspuštanje je otvoreno u Highgateu 15. lipnja 1895. očekujući veliki skup ing, vijećnička komora je potpuno promijenjena. Uobičajeni stolovi su uklonjeni i soba ispunjena stolicama. - Do pola sedam bila je gužva u sobi, sa ljudima koji su se zezali za mjesta.<br/><br/>G. Murray, povjerenik, rekao je da je upit zaista jednostavan. - Pitanje je bilo da li je dobrotvorna komisija, koja je kontrolisala sve dobrotvorne organizacije, imala dovoljno moći da ih zaustavi. - Crkveni povjerenici su bili spremni prodati zemljište pod vrlo povoljnim uvjetima i prihodi Milosrđa bi bili znatno povećani.<br/><br/>- Protiv toga su bile tri klase prigovora.<br/><br/>- Izvorni Trust je bio u svrhu pružanja vikendica siromašnima, ali povjerenici su predlagali izgradnju vila koje bi bile preskupe za siromašne. Međutim, bilo je u moći Povjerenika da razlikuju uvjete Povjerenstva, pa su mogli graditi vile ako su mislili da će Siromašni imati koristi na kraju. Treći prigovor vezan uz estetsku i javnu stranu pitanja. On je to shvatio iz onoga što je pročitao da se dobrotvorna komisija treba umiješati kako bi spriječila Eklesijastičke povjerenike da vrše vlastitu diskreciju u rješavanju vlastite imovine.<br/><br/>- Istraga je raspravljala o finim točkama, ali su se govornici stalno vraćali na glavni problem sprečavanja bilo kakvog uništavanja drveta. - Vestrijski pisar Islingtona, predstavljajući 300.000 ljudi, napravio formalni protest oko bilo kojeg dijela drveta, tako vrijedan za ljude Islingtona i Hornseya koji se koriste u privatne svrhe. - G. Wilfred White je rekao da ako im povjerenici daju vremena, moći će skupiti novac da nadoknade Povjerenicima.<br/><br/>- G. Beaumont je rekao da ne žele vile, nego vikendice za siromašne koji su istjerani iz okruga. Drugi su rekli da nema novca za izgradnju vikendica za zamjenu sadašnjih oronulih, ali vile bi bile ekonomski prijedlog, a drugi su uzvratili da postoje vile za ulazak u Highgate. - Drži se pitanja Šume.<br/><br/>Dr Flečer je rekao da je krik među radnim ljudima bio da nema gde da se ode. - Ako je pročelje Muswell Hill Road-a prodano, nema sumnje, ali putevi bi mogli biti presječeni kroz šumu u smjeru Hornseya, ali ako povjerenici ne bi mogli dobiti zemljište od dobrotvorne komisije, ne bi mogli presjeći cestu.<br/><br/>Bio je vrlo siguran da se vikendice mogu staviti u stanje popravka. Zamoljen je od siromašnih ljudi, od policije i od strane brojnih radničkih klasa da predstavljaju ove dvije točke, da je smještaj vikendica bio vrlo bolno potreban u Highgateu i da ako su jednom dopustili prodaju zemljišta, nije se znalo gdje će ostati ruka graditelja.<br/><br/>- (Glasno i dugotrajno klicanje).<br/><br/>- Brojni drugi ljudi su govorili i Komnusioner je sažeo rekavši da je uzeo da je prevladavajuće mišljenje bilo u korist zadržavanja vikendica ali sastanak ne bi trebao donositi zaključke iz onoga što je rekao (Jecaje).<br/><br/>Drugi su rekli da su poverenici Milosrđa propali u svojim dužnostima tako što su dozvolili da vikendice padnu u omalovažavanje.<br/><br/>G. H.R. Williams, povjerenik koji je ranije pisao novinama, rekao je da ga je imao na najboljem autoritetu da crkveni povjerenici neće praviti ceste bez obzira na sve i da im neće biti od koristi ni jedan jota djelovanjem dobrotvornih povjerenika. - Drugi su bili daleko manje povjerljivi i sastanak je zatvoren nakon skoro tri sata.<br/><br/>Suočeni smo s činjenicom da u Highgateu i Muswell Hillu postoji niz osoba koje žele crkveno dvorište na dnu šume i neće biti sretne dok ga ne dobiju - dok se ne pojavi da nitko ne potroši ništa da plati. Svi kažu da bi bilo dobro imati drvo kao otvoreni prostor, ali svi misle da je dužnost nekog drugog da ga napravi. - Islington Vestry je 'riješio' temu, ali Islington Vestry ne nudi ni novčića za kupnju. --- Nema težeg problema za zajednicu ili pojedinca riješiti nego kako steći vlasništvo tuđe imovine bez plaćanja za to.'<br/><br/>- Plaćanje za to je zaista bio problem jer je Churchyard Bottom Wood postao predmetom intenzivne lokalne i nacionalne debate. Cory-Wright, Hon Blagajnik, napisao je tadašnjem dnevniku The Standard, apelirajući na pomoć, podsjetio je sve na opasnost od gubitka drveta i rekao da se može spasiti samo kupnjom. Crkveni povjerenici prodavali bi za 25.000 funti i dodatno (5.000 bi bilo potrebno za mačevanje i drenažu, što bi ukupno iznosilo 30.000 funti. Šume su bile neprocjenjive vrijednosti za cijeli sjeverni London pa je apelirao na javna tijela i privatne ljude da podignu preostalih 20.000 funti. upozorio je da je sadašnja ponuda od Crkvenih povjerenika otvorena tek do kraja 1898. godine. - Nakon toga graditelji će se useliti.<br/><br/>Zakon o očuvanju šuma Highgatea, 1897., postao je zakon, a sada je imao pravo oglašavati doprinose za kupovinu šume i očuvanje.<br/><br/>Za kratko vrijeme gotovo sav novac je prikupljen, ali posljednjih nekoliko tisuća pokazalo se vrlo teškim za podizanje i rok povjerenika bio je za nekoliko tjedana. - G. Cory-Wright je napisao molbu za više vremena ali mu je odobrena samo tri mjeseca i onda samo ako je kamata na 4 posto plaćena za dodatni period na puni iznos. Na kraju Londonsko okružno vijeće, koje je prvobitno ponudilo 2.500 funti, činilo je ovo do 5.000 funti i ukupno je postignuto, ali to je bilo blizu.<br/><br/>Vijeće je odlučilo preimenovati Drvu kao 'Kraljičinu šumu' u čast jubileja dijamanata kraljice Viktorije i Hornsey je odlicno prikazalo banting kada je vojvotkinja od Albanyja formalno proglasila Drvu otvorenom 'za slobodno korištenje javnosti zauvijek'.<br/><br/>Dok su kampanju spašavanja crkvenog dvorišta Bottom Wood vodili i režirali lokalni ljudi koji su strastveno razmišljali o ovom komadu šume, pozvali su na pomoć i iskustvo ogromne mreže ljudi, od kojih su neki radili zajedno na sličnim kampanjama više od trideset godina. Odbor je izdao žalbu, tiskanu na vrlo kvalitetnom papiru i nosi neka poznata imena.<br/><br/>- Pitanja otvorenog prostora i javnog zdravlja bili su glavni subjekti viktorijanske vizije.<br/><br/>- Pokret otvorenih prostora<br/><br/>Octavia Hill, velika stambena reformatorica, koja je započela s tri stare kuće u Maryleboneu, koju joj je kupio Jolm Ruskin, brzo je postala stručnjak za stanovanje siromašnih ljudi u najzdravijim mogućim uvjetima. - Njen način je bio da kupi zakup i onda sruši neke od prenapučenih kuća kako bi donijele svjetlo i zrak ostatku, vjerujući da je svjež zrak i sunčeva svjetlost jedini način da se siromašni ljudi spasu od 'putridne groznice. To je naučila kao dijete od svog djeda, Southwooda Smitha, koji je razvio svoje teorije u bolnici Groznica u King's Crossu.<br/><br/>Gibson Gardens, u Northwold Roadu, je direktan ishod ideja Southwood Smitha.<br/><br/>\"Važnost otvorenog zraka\"<br/><br/>Octavia Hill preuzela je optužbe iz sirotinjskih četvrti Lisson Grovea, uz Fitzjohnovu aveniju do Hampstead Heatha. Toliko je voljela polja Avenije Fitzjohn da ih je pokušala kupiti kao javni park. Trebalo je samo kraj ljetnih praznika i povratak sa praznika simpatičnih prijatelja i daljnjih 1500 funti bi bilo podignuto, ali vlasnici su iznenada povukli svoju ponudu.<br/><br/>Iz toga je razvijena kampanja spašavanja Parlament Hilla, sljedećeg otvorenog prostora prema sjeveru od Lisson Grovea, kupujući polja na putu graditelja kako bi napravio trajnu kordonsku sanitaru protiv napredujućih opeka. Kampanja Parlamenta Hill Fields bila je toliko uspješna da je Zakon o Hampstead Heathu prošao i bilo je novca od žalbe. Octavia Hill je godinama bila zainteresirana za zaštitu područja kao što je Church Bottom Wood, tako da je bila prirodni saveznik u borbi za spašavanje šume.<br/><br/>- Društvo za očuvanje zajednice također, upoznato je s ovakvom vrstom agitacije i prikupljanja novca. Oni su srušili mačevanje kada su gospodari imanja zatvorili dijelove zajedničke zemlje, vodeći i legalne i ilegalne bitke protiv arogantne privatizacije zemlje tradicionalno slobodne. Robert Hunter, njihov počasni odvjetnik iz 1868. godine, uvijek se bavio osiguranjem otvorenih prostora, velikih ili malih, za javnost. Predsjedavajući Društva za očuvanje Commonsa bio je zastupnik Shaw-Lefevrea (kasnije lord Eversley) koji je odigrao veliku ulogu u ovoj i drugim kampanjama u Domu Commonsa.<br/><br/>U isto vrijeme Octavia Hill je vodio kampanju za Pogrebni zakon.<br/><br/>Gradska crkvena dvorišta postala su tako puna i tako ozbiljna opasnost po zdravlje, tako što su kontaminirali bunare iz kojih su ljudi crpili vodu za piće, da gradski sprovodi više nisu bili dozvoljeni. Tada je došlo do pokreta za uklanjanje nadgrobnih spomenika na rubove starih gradskih groblja, ponovno ispitivanje tijela drugdje i pretvaranje groblja u vrtove i otvorene prostore, umjesto da se grade na njima. Ovo zemljište u centru Londona bilo je vrlo vrijedno i špekulanti su ga željeli dobiti: Čak su ga i kvekeri izgradili preko jednog od svojih groblja i prijetili da će to opet učiniti gradnjom iznad Bunhill Fieldsa. - Octavia Hill je imala mrežu saveznika na desetak polja, tako da je njena pomoć u spašavanju crkvene šume na dnu mora da je bila neprocjenjiva.<br/><br/>Društvo Metropolitan Gardens, osnovano 1882. godine, do 1890. godine postavilo je oko dvjesto malih vrtova u gradskim centrima do 1890. godine. Kasnije su ih predali lokalnim vlastima, tako da je njihova podrška Žalbi na dno crkvenog dvorišta bila osigurana od samog početka.<br/><br/>- Društvo Kirle je sada zaboravljeno, ali je u svoje vrijeme imalo veliki utjecaj na zakonodavstvo o gradskom planiranju i otvorenom prostoru. Društvo je osnovano oko 1875. godine za 'difuziju ljepote', kako bi uvelo boju i interes u živote ljudi koji žive u dosadnom, drab okruženju. Svijetle boje do zidova i dekoracije, dobro pjevanje, otvoreni prostori, priroda, književnost i umjetnost. Postojala je dekorativna podružnica, kojoj je predavao William Morris; muzička podružnica za promicanje zborova i sretnih večeri za ljude u lokalnim školskim zgradama; i podružnica za književnost. Društvo je redovno apelovalo na pisma u Timesu, na 'bogatije razrede' za knjige i periodike koje treba distribuirati klubovima dječaka i djevojaka, milodarima i drugdje. - Samo ime 'Kyrle' je došlo od Poupovog Čovjeka od Rossa, filantropa koji je svoje rodno mjesto dao narodu kao javni park. |
| With Thanksgiving around the corner, here are some festive file folder games we made for the girls. Both Thanksgiving games focus on math skills. And I'm grateful once again to my husband, Ed, for making all the clipart for me.<br/><br/>Thanksgiving Pattern Making<br/><br/>Like the name says, this game is about making patterns. Little ones just learning about patterns, can simply match the pictures onto the pattern strips, while others can continue the pattern with the picture cards on the blank strips.<br/><br/>To make the file folder, you want to cut out the grid of pictures to make the card pieces. I recommend laminating them to help them last longer. Then glue the pattern strips down on the file folder.<br/><br/>I wanted to have the blank pattern strips too so that the girls could see where to continue the pattern and how many to lay out. I attached them to the side of the folder using tape so that they could fold in to pack up the game and extend to layout the pattern.<br/><br/>I also added an extra blank one so that the girls could make their own pattern as well.<br/><br/>Turkey Number Game<br/><br/>In this game the girls add the feathers to the turkey body while practicing counting and number recognition. I used the colorless feathers to act as a guide for where to add the feathers and so that the girls could match the numbers. And be sure when gluing down the turkey body you only glue in the center so that the wing pieces can slide under the body.<br/><br/>Once all the feathers are laid out, we practice some simple arithmetic, such as taking away three feathers and seeing how many are left then adding two back to see what it equals.<br/><br/>In addition to black and white wings, we also included a colorless turkey in case you want to have the little ones color their own set. Instead of a file folder game you can turn this into a craft, coloring the pieces, cutting them out, and gluing them together.<br/><br/>Another option is to use the pieces to make a felt board story. We sometimes sing a turkey version of 10 Little Indians:<br/><br/>Like this:<br/><br/>Who Am I?<br/><br/>I think this is where I'm suppose to say something witty about myself. Oh well. I'm a stay-at-home mom to three awesome kids--our twin daughters who are seven now and a two-year-old son who is full of energy. In my pre-children life I was a teacher and I now homeschool our children. I'm also married to Ed, who is currently serving in the Air Force, and is the love of my life (it'd be awkward if he wasn't). Our family is big on books, crafts, and having fun together. I just thought I would share our activities in my own little corner of the internet.<br/><br/>Zoe appears to have it all--rich, handsome husband, easy New York life--but she made mistakes in her past and those mistakes are coming back up in her new life. I found myself on the edge of my seat for most of the book and was surprised...<br/><br/>I loved this book, I love the story, and I am grateful Margot Shetterly brought it to light.

Koristio sam bezbojno perje da djelujem kao vodič za gdje dodati perje i tako da djevojke mogu odgovarati brojevima. I budite sigurni da kada lepkate pureće telo lepite samo u sredini tako da delovi krila mogu da klize ispod tela.<br/><br/>- Jednom kada se sva pera postave, vježbamo neku jednostavnu aritmetiku, kao što je oduzimanje tri pera i gledanje koliko ih je ostalo onda dodajemo dva natrag da vidimo koliko je jednaka.<br/><br/>Uz crno-bijela krila, uključili smo i bezbojnu puricu u slučaju da želite da mališani obojaju vlastiti set. Umjesto igre fascikli možete ovo pretvoriti u letjelicu, obojiti dijelove, izrezati ih i zalijepiti zajedno.<br/><br/>Ponekad pjevamo pureću verziju 10 malih Indijanaca:<br/><br/>\"Ovako:<br/><br/>- Ko sam ja?<br/><br/>Ja sam majka troje divne dece, naše ćerke bliznakinje koje sada imaju sedam godina i dvogodišnjeg sina koji je pun energije.

| Alcohol use by persons under age 21 has been identified as a major public health problem. Studies note that it increases the risks for disability, and may be detrimental to the developing brain. Minors who drink are more likely to commit suicide, break the law, or be victims of violence. Alcohol is implicated in nearly one-third of youth traffic fatalities. The total annual cost of underage drinking is estimated at $62 billion. While most laws intended to prevent underage drinking are passed at the state level, there has been legislative activity and interest at the federal level to support states' efforts to curb the problem. This report describes the extent of underage alcohol use, recent legislative activity on this issue, and various policy implications. It will be updated as new data become available. | Ispitivanja pokazuju da povećava rizik od invaliditeta i može biti štetan za mozak u razvoju. Alkohol je umiješan u skoro trećinu smrtnih slučajeva u prometu mladih, ukupna godišnja cijena alkohola maloljetnika procjenjuje se na 62 milijarde dolara. - Dok se većina zakona namijenjenih sprječavanju maloljetničkog opijanja donosi na državnoj razini, na saveznoj razini je bilo zakonodavne aktivnosti i interesa za potporu naporima država da se taj problem obuzda. U ovom izvještaju opisuje se opseg zloupotrebe alkohola maloljetnika, nedavna zakonodavna aktivnost u vezi s ovim pitanjem i različite implikacije politike. |
| Tag Archives: real food<br/><br/>Last week I wrote about the Nordic Food Manifesto, and how Denmark created a strong "real food" culture largely from an intentional effort led by Claus Meyer. It wasn't political lobbying or public petitioning that resulted in food reform, but rather a grassroots effort led by citizens with the power to actually implement and follow-through with change.<br/><br/>I ended the post alluding to one question: Why is it so hard for us to do this ourselves, as individuals? If an entire country can implement and spread a common view towards food, why can't we?<br/><br/>There's nothing really stopping us from mimicking Denmark's success. The problem is, we're inundated with so many messages about what we should be eating, and how we should be living, it's hard to know where to start. So rather than following successful frameworks that have been shown to work (like the Nordic Food Manifesto), most people jump from diet craze to diet craze, trying to find the "right way to eat."<br/><br/>But how did Claus Meyer succeed? What was the secret sauce that helped the Manifesto take hold? And is it reasonable to think we can apply those lessons to our own lives?
