Undocumented migrants have nothing. They are not allowed to work. They have no right to state benefits nor to a place to live. They are unseen and potentially the most vulnerable group in the UK today.<br/><br/>Undocumented (or irregular) migrants include those trafficked into the sex trade or for domestic servitude; they include visa overstayers; those whose asylum applications have been refused and others who have been subject to failures in the immigration system. All of these may originally have come to the UK legally.<br/><br/>'Illegal immigrants' – those imagined to have entered the country in the backs of lorries – make up a small proportion of the undocumented.<br/><br/>Indeed some sources suggest that half the estimated 120,000 undocumented children in the UK were actually born here to undocumented parents. These children are disadvantaged from birth, solely by their immigration status.<br/><br/>The blog tells the stories of the undocumented. It highlights their daily struggles and vulnerabilities, but also their strength and resilience. It's not an easy read.<br/><br/>You can access the blog via our website (bottom of right hand column on Home Page).<br/><br/>The blog has won the online category of the Speaking Together media awards. The awards were a new addition this year to the Migrant and Refugee Woman of the Year Awards celebration at the Royal Festival Hall in London as part of International Women's Day. The panel of judges – including novelist and playwright Gillian Slovo, and journalist and author, Hannah Pool – was particularly looking for work that challenged myths and stereotypes.<br/><br/>The blog has also won the Blog North Awards 2013 in the Best Writing category and was also shortlisted for an Amnesty International Media Award. | Post navigacija<br/><br/>- Život bez novina - dobitnik nagrade za najbolje pisanje<br/><br/>Na blogu, koji je stvorio Len Grant, nalaze se priče o nedokumentovanim migrantima i mladima, nedokumentiranim migrantima koji nemaju ništa, ne smiju raditi, nemaju pravo na državne povlastice ni na mjesto za život.

| Sabbath School Lesson<br/><br/>In Galatians, Paul tackles issues such as freedom, the role of the law in salvation, our condition in Christ, and the nature of the Spirit-led life, as well as the age-old question, How can sinful humans be made right before a holy and just God?<br/><br/>Many scholars believe that Galatians may be the earliest of Paul's letters. It was written in A.D. 49, shortly after the famous Jerusalem Council (Acts 15). Therefore, the book may be the oldest Christian document known. As Acts and Galatians make clear, the early church found itself in a fierce battle over the nature of salvation, especially in the case of Gentiles. According to a group of Jewish believers, known as Judaizers, belief in Jesus alone was not good enough for Gentiles. Gentiles must also be circumcised and follow the laws of Moses (Acts 15:1).<br/><br/>This quarter's Bible study guide invites us to journey with the apostle Paul as he pleads with the Galatians to remain true to Jesus. It also gives us a chance to reflect on our own understanding of the truths that opened the way for Martin Luther's ultimate break with Rome and the restoration of the biblical gospel. | Sabbath School Lection<br/><br/>U Galaćanima, Pavao rješava pitanja kao što su sloboda, uloga zakona u spasenju, naše stanje u Kristu, i priroda života vođenog Duhom, kao i pitanje starost, kako grešni ljudi mogu biti stvoreni pred svetim i pravednim Bogom?<br/><br/>Mnogi učenjaci vjeruju da su Galaćani možda najraniji Pavlovih pisama, napisana je 49. godine, nedugo nakon čuvenog Jerusalemskog vijeća (Djela 15). Djela apostolska i Galaćani jasno pokazuju da se rana crkva našla u žestokoj borbi oko prirode spasenja, posebno u slučaju neznabožaca. Prema grupi židovskih vjernika, poznatih kao Judaizeri, vjerovanje samo u Isusa nije bilo dovoljno dobro za neznabošce.<br/><br/>Ovaj kvartalni vodič za proučavanje Biblije poziva nas da putujemo s apostolom Pavlom dok moli Galaćane da ostanu vjerni Isusu. To nam također daje priliku da razmislimo o vlastitom razumijevanju istina koje su otvorile put konačnom prekidu Martina Luthera s Rimom i obnovi biblijskog evanđelja. |

Frederick je smatran popularnim i inteligentnim, tijekom svoje vladavine, zajedno sa svojom prekrasnom suprugom, Charlotte, kulturni život u malom gradu dosegao je svoj zenit. Toliko pjesnika i umjetnika provodilo je tamo vrijeme da je Hildburghausen dobio nadimak Klein-Weimar, kada je posljednji vojvoda Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg umro bez problema 1825. godine, ostale grane kuće odlučile su se na preustroj Ernestine duchies. Frederick je 12. studenog 1826. postao vojvoda od Saxe-Altenburga, kojem je dao prvi osnovni zakon 1831. godine, u zamjenu za medije vezane uz Fredericka, vojvodu od Saxe-Altenburga na Wikimedia Commons geneall. net<br/><br/>Frederick, vojvoda od Saxe-Altenburga<br/>âTMa âTMa<br/>Frederik<br/><br/>-15.<br/>vojvotkinja Charlotte Georgine od Mecklenburg-Strelitz<br/>âTMa âTMa<br/>Charlotte Georgine rođena je u Hanoveru, Izbornik Brunswick-Lüneburga.

Jean Paul Friedrich Richter posvetio je svoj roman Titan četvero lijepih, Charlotte je odrasla u Hanoveru, gdje joj je otac služio kao guverner, u ime svog šogora, kralja Georgea III od Ujedinjenog Kraljevstva, koji je živio u Londonu. Kada je Charlotte imala dvanaest godina, umrla joj je majka i odgojila ju je sestra njene majke, Charlotte, koja se 1784. udala za oca, a sestre joj je dovela baka, Maria Louise Albertine iz Leiningen-Falkenburg-Dagsburga u Darmstadtu.

Prijemnici su dozvolili vojvodi i vojvotkinji samo smanjeni popis građana, Charlottein otac i dva brata često su boravili kod Charlotte u Hildburghausenu. 1787. godine, njezino trajno preseljenje u Hildburghausen, te je postao predsjednik kreditnog odbora. 1792. godine, baka Charlottes i njene sestre pobjegle su pred nadolazećom francuskom vojskom iz Darmstadta u Hildburghausen i njena baka primijetili su da je Charlottein muž, od svih svojih dužnosti, on ispunjava svoje bračne dužnosti s revnošću. Charlotte, koja nikad nije voljela ovog čovjeka, je uvijek trudna, obitelj je provela nekoliko bezbrižnih tjedana u Hildburghausenu. 1793. godine, baka Charlottes se vratila iz izgnanstva i otputovala sa sestrama Charlottes u Frankfurt am Main, Charlotte je imala vrlo intiman i pun ljubavi odnos sa sestrom Friederike i rođacima u Strelitzu. 1803. i 1805. pruski kraljevski par posjetio je Hildburghausen, za ovu priliku, prijemnici su dozvolili dukalnom paru da obnovi dio namještaja. Louise je pomogla izraditi objavu rata, Christian Truchseß von Wetzhausen zu Bettenburg je bio prijatelj dukalnog para i kum Charlottesovog sina Edwarda. - Mnogi gledaoci su došli vidjeti bavarsku krunsku princezu, kada su primili njegove goste, Truchseß je pokušao dovesti niže rangiranu Charlotte prvo u njegov dvorac, ali je ona odbila, pozivajući se na svoju kćer. - Truchseß je odgovorio, Vaše Veličanstvo će mi oprostiti, ali dokle god je ovaj dvorac stajao ovdje, Therese je onda zgrabila barune za drugu ruku, a njih troje su zajedno prošli kroz vrata.<br/><br/>- 1617.<br/>Princ Charles od Hesse-Kassela<br/>âTMa âTMa<br/>Princ Charles od Hesse-Kassela bio je kadetski član kuće Hesse-Kassela i danski general feldmaršal.

Marija se 1756. preselila u Dansku, kako bi se brinula o maloljetnoj djeci svoje sestre, kraljice Louise od Danske. Hesijski knezovi su kasnije ostali u Danskoj, postajući njeni važni gospodari, samo najstariji brat Vilim vratio se u Hesse, 1785. godine, nakon uzdizanja kopnene gravije. 1758. imenovan je pukovnikom, u 20-oj godini general bojnika, također 1766. imenovan je generalnim guvernerom Norveške, mjestom koje je obnašao do 1768. ali koje je ostalo uglavnom titularno, jer u tom periodu nikada nije otišao u Norvešku. 1763. godine, njegov stariji brat William oženio se njihovim prvim rođakom, Charles je slijedio tužbu 30. kolovoza 1766. godine u palači Christianborg — žena mu je bila Louise od Danske, a Charles je tako postao šurjak svom rođaku, kralju Christianu VII. - Brak se dogodio unatoč savjetima danim protiv njega, zbog optužbi za razvrat od strane princa Charlesa. Ubrzo nakon toga, Charles je pao u nemilost na dvoru, a početkom 1767. on i oni će imati svoje prvo dijete, Marie Sophie, tamo 1767. godine, a zatim i njihovo drugo dijete, William, 1769. godine.

Oni bi tamo 1771. imali svoje treće dijete Frederick, 1770. kralj Christian VII. dao je svojoj sestri imanje Tegelhof u Gübyju između grada Schleswiga i Eckernfördea. Charles je od 1772. do 1776. dao izgraditi ljetnu rezidenciju na mjestu koje je imenovao Louisenlund u čast svoje supruge, u rujnu 1772. Charles je imenovan vrhovnim zapovjednikom norveške vojske i on i Louise su se preselili u Christianu. Dodeljivanje je bilo posljedica državnog udara kralja Gustava III švedskog 19. kolovoza 1772. godine, dok je u Norveškoj princeza Louise rodila njihovo četvrto dijete Juliane 1773. godine.<br/><br/>- 18. - 18.<br/>Louise Caroline od Hesse-Kassela<br/>âTMa âTMa<br/>Louise Caroline rođena je u Gottorpu u vojvodstvu Schleswigu Landgrave Charles od Hesse-Kassela i njegova supruga princeza Louise od Danske.<br/>âTMa âTMa<br/>Princeza Louise Caroline<br/><br/>-19. -19.<br/>Princ Frederik od Hesea<br/>âTMa âTMa<br/>Landgrave Frederick<br/><br/>-20. -20.<br/>Princ Vilim od Hese Princa Vilima od Hesea<br/>âTMa âTMa<br/>William od Hesse-Kassela<br/><br/>- 212223.<br/>- Princeza Louise24.<br/>Sophia Frederica od Mecklenburg-Schwerina<br/>âTMa âTMa<br/>Sophia Frederica od Me252627 materinjska28.<br/>Albert Azzo II, Grave of Milano<br/>âTMa âTMa<br/>Alberto Azzo II, Margrave od Milana, i Ligurija, grof od Gavella i Padovane, Rovigo, Lunigiana, Monselice, i Montagnana, zvani Albertezzo II, bio je moćni plemić u Svetom Rimskom Carstvu.

Welf se oženio Etelindom od Northeima, kćerkom Otta II, vojvode od Bavarske, kada je njegov tast, vojvoda Otto postao neprijatelj kralja Henrika IV i izgubio svoje vojvodstvo, Welf je ostao lojalan kralju. U skladu s Henrysovim naredbama, on je odbio i razveo se od svoje vojvotkinje Ethelinde i ovaj događaj se dogodio kod Goslara 1070. godine, kada su se Bavarske države tiho podvrgnule novonastalom vojvodi, koji je bio predstavnik jedne od najdrevnijih obitelji u pokrajini. Papa i car su se površno pomirili 1076. godine, ali godina kada su se ponovo uključili u aktivna neprijateljstva. Henry je, nakon ponovljenih djela pobune, proglasio Welfa svrgnutim u svom tek stečenom vojvodstvu. Međutim, uz podršku svojih vjernih Bavaraca, a uz pomoć oca u Italiji, Welf je uspio održati svoje mjesto, međutim, Grgur je umro 1085. godine i njegovi nasljednici su manje intenzivno sudjelovali u poslovima Njemačke. Welf, iako se još uvijek pridržava crkvene stranke, nakon razvoda, 1070. godine, od svoje prve supruge, Welf se oženio Juditom od Flandrije, kćerkom Baldwina IV, grofom od Flandrije, i udovicom Tostiga Godwinsona, grofom od Northumbrie. 1089. godine, Welfsov sin Welf oženio se Matildom Toskanom, čime je ojačao odnose s papom, međutim, nakon što se mlađi Welf razveo od Matilde 1095. godine, Welf se iskupio kralju Henriku IV. te je ponovno potvrđen na svom položaju vojvode od Bavarske. Welf je nakon smrti oca Azza 1097. pokušao steći očeve posjede južno od Alpa, 1099. godine, Welf se pridružio onome što će postati poznato kao križarski rat 1101, zajedno s Williamom IX Akvitanskim, Hughom od Vermandoisa i Idom od Austrije. Glavni uspjeh bio mu je spriječiti sukob između sukrštava, koji su pljačkali bizantsku teritoriju na putu za Carigrad, sam Welf je pobjegao fijasku, ali je umro na povratku u Paphos, na Cipru, 1101. godine i pokopan je u opatiji Weingarten.

On je težio da naslijedi svog tasta kao saksonskog vojvodu kada je Magnus umro bez nasljednika 1106. godine.

On je naslijedio svog starijeg brata Welfa II kao bavarskog vojvodu, kada je potonji umro bez djece 1120. godine, Henrik je također bio instrumentalan u dovođenju oko 1122 Concordata Wormsa, okončavši dugotrajnu investiturnu kontroverzu između pape i cara.

| Follow Us<br/><br/>ARE YOU AN<br/><br/>INSIDER<br/><br/>Craving Sugar? Here's What Your Body Is Trying to Tell You<br/><br/>by<br/>Byrdie<br/><br/>PHOTO:<br/><br/>Jacquemus<br/><br/>Weight gain from out-of-control cravings aside, it can be frustrating to have a constant hankering for something unhealthy and not know why. The good news is that there's usually a reason underlying that burning desire to house a bag of potato chips, or the feeling that you might actually die if you don't get a pickle rightthisinstant (even though you're not pregnant). If you're having visions of Milky Way bars, for example, it could mean that you're missing a very specific nutrient in your diet. (Yup—it's more complicated than said chocolate bar being so darn delicious.)<br/><br/>We talked to Los Angeles–based dietitian Shira Lenchewski, M.S., R.D., to get the skinny on some common food cravings, as well as what you can do to satiate the hunger without going overboard. Keep scrolling for some seriously good information!<br/><br/>If you're craving chocolate<br/><br/>It means: You could be lacking magnesium in your diet, says Lenchewski. "Magnesium is an essential mineral involved in energy production, glucose metabolism, and muscle function. This is especially true for those hitting the gym hard," she explains. Additionally, magnesium levels lower during the pre-menstrual weeks of your period, which explains why PMS so often comes with chocolate cravings.<br/><br/>Instead, reach for high-quality, low-sugar dark chocolate, which is naturally high in magnesium. "I recommend sticking to 75 per cent cocoa or higher, and pairing it with another magnesium-rich source like sunflower seeds," says Lenchewski. She suggests the chocolate brand Hu, a small-batch food company that focuses on high-quality ingredients produced locally. "It's a little pricey, but all the more reason to keep portions in check," she says. "It's my personal favourite." We're also big fans of superfood-packed Zenbunni.<br/><br/>If you're craving candy<br/><br/>It means: "Craving pure sugar is a good indication that you're running low on energy," says Lenchewski. "Think about it. What is the one thing you're itching for after a terrible night's sleep or at around 4 p.m. during a stressful workday? The answer is usually sugar because it's used as instant fuel for our body's cells."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for apples with nut butter. "If you're raiding your co-workers' candy stash, I recommend a more slow-burn carbohydrate with a source of fat or protein," says Lenchewski. "Unlike simple sugar, this will fuel your cells while avoiding the post-sugar crash. Two options that make for great pick-me-ups the next time you're craving candy: a sliced apple with your choice of nut butter, or berries with 2% unsweetened Greek yoghurt." We like quashing a sweet tooth with these addictive coconut chips, too—they're filling, free of any added sugar, and just so good.<br/><br/>If you're craving salt<br/><br/>It means: "If nothing but the saltiest pickle will do, you may not be drinking enough H2O," says Lenchewski. "Salt helps the body hold on to water, so we crave it when we're in need of fluids."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for water. "Stay hydrated, especially as we approach the summer months," she says. The next time a craving hits, try quenching it (literally) with a few refreshing glasses and you might find the urgency to sodium binge disappears. "If plain water bores you, try adding in mint, lemon, or frozen fruit to mix it up," says Lenchewski. And if that still doesn't do the trick, there's a healthier alternative to bagged chips or fries. "If you're really just craving salt after all, toasted seaweed is a great low-calorie option," she says.<br/><br/>If you're craving starchy carbs like pasta<br/><br/>It means: "Because high-carb foods boost the feel-good hormone serotonin, starch cravings can be a sign you're in need of a mood booster," says Lenchewski.<br/><br/>Instead, reach for a bath! "Bust out the Epsom salts, because it's time for some serious R+R," says Lenchewski. "Trust me. Indulging in a starch free-for-all feels really good in the moment, but it will likely bum you out more the next day." (As anyone who has ever over-indulged a pizza or pasta craving knows.) So the next time you want to dive head first into a bowl of carbs, draw a bath, light a candle, and treat yourself without any regret or dense calories.<br/><br/>If you're craving ice cream<br/><br/>5 / 6<br/><br/>It means: "Your body may be telling you it's in need of some healthy fat."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for coconut ice cream. "I'm a realist, so if you're craving ice cream, I'm not going to recommend a handful of walnuts, which are, of course, full of healthy fat," says Lenchewski. "For ice cream emergencies, I recommend lower-in-sugar coconut ice-creams like Coconut Bliss or Kippy's three-ingredient ice cream in Los Angeles." We can vouch for the fact that coconut ice cream tastes incredible and just like the real thing.<br/><br/>If you're craving a burger<br/><br/>It means: You need iron. "If you can't stop thinking about red meat, there's a chance your body is craving iron, b12 and folic acid," says Lenchewski. "This is especially true during or around that time of the month."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for a healthier burger. "I'm a proponent of grass fed, antibiotic and hormone-free red meat once a week," says Lenchewski. "Try experimenting with an open-faced bison burger—which, cut for cut, is leaner and has more iron than beef." Don't eat meat? Try to incorporate some kind of plant-based iron supplement into your routine, like spirulina. | \"Pratite nas\"<br/><br/>âTMa Jesi li ti âTMa<br/><br/>\"INSIDER\"<br/><br/>Evo što ti tijelo pokušava reći.<br/><br/>Do<br/>Byrdie<br/><br/>FOTO:<br/><br/>Jacquemus<br/><br/>Na stranu dobitak težine od nekontrolisane žudnje, može biti frustrirajuće imati konstantnu žudnju za nečim nezdravim i ne znati zašto. Dobra vijest je da obično postoji razlog zbog kojeg se krije ta goruća želja da se stavi vrećica čipsa, ili osjećaj da bi zapravo mogla umrijeti ako ne dobiješ krastavac u pravu ovaj instant (iako nisi trudna). Ako imate vizije Mliječnih staza, na primjer, to bi moglo značiti da vam nedostaje vrlo specifična hranjiva tvar u prehrani. (Yup) Kompliciranije je od toga da je čokolada tako prokleto ukusna.)<br/><br/>Razgovarali smo sa dijetetičarkom Shirom Lenchewski, M.S., R.D., kako bismo dobili mršave o nekim uobičajenim željama za hranom, kao i o tome što možete učiniti da zadovoljite glad bez da pretjerate.<br/><br/>Ako žudiš za čokoladom<br/><br/>To znači: možda vam nedostaje magnezija u prehrani, kaže Lenchewski. -Magnezij je esencijalan mineral uključen u proizvodnju energije, metabolizam glukoze i funkciju mišića. Osim toga, nivo magnezija se smanjio u pretmenstrualnim tjednima vašeg razdoblja, što objašnjava zašto PMS često dolazi sa žudnjom za čokoladom.<br/><br/>Umjesto toga, posegnite za visokokvalitetnom, niskošećernom tamnom čokoladom, koja je prirodno visoka u magneziju. - Preporučam da se zalijepite za 75 posto kakaoa ili više, i da je uparite s drugim izvorom bogatim magnezijem poput sjemenki suncokreta - kaže Lenchewski. Ona predlaže čokoladnu marku Hu, malu kompaniju koja se fokusira na kvalitetne sastojke proizvedene lokalno. Također smo veliki obožavatelji superhrane Zenbunnija.<br/><br/>Ako žudiš za slatkišima<br/><br/>- To znači: - Razmazivanje čistog šećera je dobra indikacija da ti ponestaje energije - kaže Lenchewski. - Razmislite o tome. - Što je jedina stvar za kojom žudiš nakon užasnog noćnog sna ili oko 4 popodne tijekom stresnog radnog dana? Odgovor je obično šećer jer se koristi kao instant gorivo za ćelije našeg tijela.<br/><br/>Umjesto toga, posegnite za jabukama s maslacem od oraha. - Za razliku od običnog šećera, ovo će vam napuniti ćelije gorivom, izbjegavajući pad nakon šećera. \"Dvije opcije koje čine za velike pick-me-upove sljedeći put kada čezneš za slatkišima: narezana jabuka s tvojim izborom maslaca od oraha, ili bobice s 2% nezaslađenog grčkog jogurta \" Volimo da se zaljubljujemo u slatkiše sa ovim kokosovim čipsom koji izaziva ovisnost, takođe. Pune se, bez dodanog šećera, i to tako dobro.<br/><br/>Ako žudiš za solju<br/><br/>To znači: ako ništa drugo do najslaniji krastavac može poslužiti, možda nećete piti dovoljno H2O - kaže Lenchewski.<br/><br/>-Umjesto toga, posegnite za vodom. -Ostanite hidrirani, pogotovo dok se približavamo ljetnim mjesecima - kaže ona. Sljedeći put kada se požuda pogodi, pokušajte je ugasiti (doslovno) s nekoliko osvježavajućih čaša i možda ćete naći hitnost za natrij binge nestaje. Ako vam je dosadna obična voda, pokušajte dodati metvicu, limun ili smrznuto voće da ga pomiješate, kaže Lenchewski, a ako to još uvijek ne uspije, postoji zdravija alternativa za pakiranje čipsa ili pomfrita. -Ako stvarno žudiš za soli, alga je odlična opcija za niskokaloričnu kaloriju. -Kaže ona.<br/><br/>Ako žudiš za škrobnim ugljikohidratima kao što je tjestenina<br/><br/>- To znači: - Zbog toga što hrana sa visokim ugljenim hidratima pojačava serotonin dobrog hormona, žudnja za škrobom može biti znak da vam treba pojačalo raspoloženja - kaže Lenchewski.<br/><br/>Umesto toga, posegnite za kadom! (Pokupite Epsom soli, jer je vrijeme za neke ozbiljne R+R - kaže Lenchewski. (Vjerujte mi.) Udovoljavajući u škrob slobodno-za-sve osjeća jako dobro u trenutku, ali to će vas vjerojatno više izmoriti sutradan.) Kao što zna svatko tko je ikada pretjerao s pizzom ili žudnjom za tjesteninom.) Dakle, sljedeći put kada želite zaroniti glavom u zdjelu ugljikohidrata, napraviti kupku, zapaliti svijeću, i liječiti se bez žaljenja ili gustih kalorija.<br/><br/>Ako žudiš za sladoledom<br/><br/>5 / 6<br/><br/>To znači: \"Možda ti tijelo govori da mu je potrebna zdrava mast\"<br/><br/>Ja sam realist, pa ako žudite za sladoledom, neću preporučiti šaku oraha, koji su, naravno, puni zdrave masti - kaže Lenchewski. Za hitne slučajeve sladoleda preporučujem niže šećerne kokosove sladolede kao što je Kokosovo blago ili Kippyjev sladoled sa tri sastojka u Los Angelesu. Možemo garantirati da sladoled od kokosa ima nevjerojatan okus i kao pravi.<br/><br/>Ako žudiš za hamburgerom<br/><br/>Ako ne možete prestati razmišljati o crvenom mesu, postoji šansa da vaše tijelo žudi za željezom, b12 i folnom kiselinom - kaže Lenchewski.<br/><br/>Umjesto toga, posegnite za zdravijim hamburgerom. - Ja sam zagovornik hrane trave, antibiotika i bez hormona crvenog mesa jednom tjedno - kaže Lenchewski. - Probajte eksperimentirati s otvorenim bizonskim hamburgerom - koji je, izrezan za rezanje, mršaviji i ima više željeza od govedine. Pokušaj ugraditi neku vrstu biljnog gvožđa u svoju rutinu, kao spirulina. |

Spoiler alert: This brain teaser is entirely solvable. Scroll down to read the puzzle, and to get the answer. Good luck!<br/><br/>Here's The Puzzle<br/><br/>Alice and Bob are each told a number, but neither knows the other's number. Both of the numbers are positive and consecutive. In the room with Alice and Bob, there is a clock that dings every minute. Someone can guess the other's number only at the ding of that clock, but they can also remain silent. If someone correctly guesses the other's number on the first try, both people $1 million.<br/><br/>There is a way to win without any form of communication between Alice and Bob, and, duh, without cheating. It's completely logical and can guarantee a win on the first try. How can they do it? Watch the video below to find out.<br/><br/>The Seemingly Impossible Guess The Number Puzzle<br/><br/>Share the knowledge!<br/><br/>Here's The Answer<br/><br/>Suppose Alice is told the number N. She hears the clock ding N-1 times, so she knows that Bob was told N+1. Therefore, on the next ding, she can correctly guess Bob's secret number. If we're dealing with small numbers, however, it can be played differently. If Alice was told 1, she knows Bob was told 2 because 0 is not a positive (or negative) number.

Spoiler alert: Ovaj zadirkivač mozga je potpuno rješiv. - Sretno!<br/><br/>- Evo zagonetke.<br/><br/>U sobi s Alice i Bobom, postoji sat koji otkucava svake minute. Ako netko ispravno pogodi broj drugog u prvom pokušaju, obojica će imati milijun dolara.<br/><br/>Postoji način da pobijedimo bez komunikacije između Alice i Boba i bez varanja.<br/><br/>- Izgleda nemoguće pogoditi broj zagonetke<br/><br/>- Podijelite znanje!<br/><br/>\"Evo odgovora\"<br/><br/>- Pretpostavimo da Alice kaže broj N. Ona čuje sat ding N-1 puta, tako da zna da je Bobu rečeno N+1. Dakle, na sljedeći ding, ona može točno pogoditi Bobov tajni broj. Ako se radi o malim brojevima, međutim, to se može igrati drugačije. Ako je Alice rečeno 1, zna da je Bobu rečeno 2 jer 0 nije pozitivan (ili negativan) broj. |
| Web Services, Vendors And Cyber Laws!<br/><br/>Updated On:April 21, 2014Bilal Ahmad<br/><br/>Computerization of this world changed human performance scenario to a great extent and that too beyond measurement. For instance, Now you can send vital information all across the globe with a single mouse click, thanks to internet connectivity. Sadly, it is this wide connectivity and popularity among people, internet has also increased chances for computer crimes. Internet crimes or computer crimes are widely known as 'Cyber Crimes'.<br/><br/>'Cyber Laws' is something new in the judiciary system but has gained a lot of attention lately. The term cyber crime is something very synonymous with conventional crime, the only difference being medium of execution. There are majorly two types of cyber crimes, the first one is in which computers are the main targets and these include cases of data damage, malicious code and even criminal data access. The second one is in which computer is only a tool using which conventional crimes are committed for eg cyber terrorism, spamming, cyber stalking and many more.<br/><br/>This is where a website consultant or a vendor comes into scene. Although not aware of all the cyber laws present till date, a website vendor can advise you on some of the most vital cyber laws while creating your site.<br/><br/>This may include common knowledge of copy rights or even protecting the content of your own website. Explaining you all the rights you posses as a website owner is also one the tasks a website vendor may do while developing your website. A vendor can also assist you by offering you information on different cyber laws to protect data. Besides all of this, a vendor can also offer you information on any new cyber law that you may not be aware of till know. Cyber laws may vary from nation to nation, one recent example can be of the cookie law released in the United Kingdom, which prevents the website from saving any user browsing data. As per the Cookie Law, websites in the United Kingdom cannot save cookie files without informational consent from the surfer.<br/><br/>It is after the implementation of such law, websites now have a pop-up window, which seeks the consent of the visitor for saving cookies files. Such files are used by websites to analyze the browsing pattern of visitors based on which advertisements are then posted on a user window. With hacking not anymore a new thing for all of us, do you think such rules and regulations can prevent online forgery or cyber crime? Technology has developed at a rapid rate but still people do not prefer shopping online due to fear of personal or bank account details getting hacked. With the rise of cyber crime, need of stringent cyber laws have also increased to curb the same and to promote a risk free shopping experience.<br/><br/>Classes of Cyber Crimes<br/><br/>Over the years there have been three major classes of cyber crimes:<br/><br/>Unauthorized access of computer system cases, which involves hacking or stealing usernames and passwords to gain access over personal information of the respective user. These kind of backdoor access are organized with the help of Trojan Horse. Releasing malicious programs like Trojan House, worms or computer viruses etc. The last class includes cyber stalking a user or online harassment .<br/><br/>Direct implications of Cyber crimes<br/><br/>Decrease in sales<br/><br/>Decrease in staff output due to network delays<br/><br/>Loss of personalized information like research work<br/><br/>Disruption in communication process<br/><br/>Indirect implications of Cyber crimes<br/><br/>Credibility issue in our financial system<br/><br/>Brand image is tarnished in the market<br/><br/>Cyber crimes affect business to business relationship in the market<br/><br/>Sense of trust in state policies and government agencies is lost<br/><br/>Preventing Cyber Crime<br/><br/>As netizens there are certain precautions that we should consider for a safe and secure online experience. Here are some of them:<br/><br/>First thing to do will be to keep personal information to your self and avoid sharing the same online.<br/><br/>Avoid sharing any photographs with online chat friends or strangers.<br/><br/>Installing latest version of anti-virus on your system can offer you a good line of defense against internet threats like viruses and malware.<br/><br/>Keeping back up of your valuable data is a good option to avoid problems like virus contamination.<br/><br/>Avoid sending credit card information to sites that are unsecured and don't have any valid certificate.<br/><br/>Installing safety programme that offers you control over site cookies and saves you from being tracked by websites.<br/><br/>Putting host-based intrusions detection devices on servers will help you keep track of irregularities on your website traffic.<br/><br/>Use of firewall is advised.<br/><br/>Why Cyber attacks are so popular?<br/><br/>Cheaper than traditional cheating methods<br/><br/>Tracking cyber crimes are not easy<br/><br/>Exact locations cannot be tracked easily<br/><br/>Absence of physical barrier in the internet world<br/><br/>Cyber crimes affect large number of people<br/><br/>Conclusion<br/><br/>The fact that human mind has unfathomable power is undeniable, which is why internet crimes are increasing at a tremendous rate. Even history has witnessed some of the greatest internet security gone kaput by the hands of hackers, who have easily got away too. The only way to curb such crime is to remain aware of the cyber laws that we have today, that can either be through internet or through website/IT vendors. Information Technology Act has to be balanced in such a way that it proves too stringent for people who are involved in cyber crimes and at the same time it should never hamper the growth of Internet industry.<br/><br/>Author Bio:– Maneet Puri at present is heading a quality web design firm located at New Delhi, India.

Nažalost, to je ta široka povezivost i popularnost među ljudima, internet je također povećao šanse za računalne zločine.<br/><br/>\"Cyber Laws\" je nešto novo u pravosudnom sistemu, ali je u poslednje vreme stekao mnogo pažnje. - Postoje uglavnom dvije vrste kibernetičkih zločina, prva je u kojoj su računala glavne mete i ona uključuju slučajeve oštećenja podataka, zlonamjernog koda pa čak i pristup kriminalnim podacima. - Druga je u kojoj je kompjuter samo alat kojim se koriste konvencionalni zločini počinjeni za npr. kibernetički terorizam, spamovanje, kibernetičko uhođenje i još mnogo toga.<br/><br/>Iako nije svjestan svih cyber zakona prisutnih do danas, prodavač web stranice može vas savjetovati o nekim od najvažnijih sajber zakona dok stvarate svoju stranicu.<br/><br/>To može uključivati opće znanje o pravima kopiranja ili čak i zaštitu sadržaja vlastite web stranice. Objašnjavajući vam sva prava koja posjedujete kao vlasnik web stranice je također jedan od zadataka web-stranica prodavač može učiniti dok razvija svoju web-stranicu. Prodavač vam također može pomoći nudeći vam informacije o različitim sajber zakonima kako bi zaštitili podatke. Osim svega toga, prodavač vam može ponuditi i informacije o bilo kojem novom cyber zakonu kojih možda nećete biti svjesni dok ne saznate. Cyber zakoni mogu varirati od nacije do nacije, jedan od nedavnih primjera može biti zakon o kolačićima objavljen u Ujedinjenom Kraljevstvu, koji sprječava web stranicu da sačuva bilo kakve podatke o pretraživanju korisnika. Prema Zakonu o kolačićima, web stranice u Ujedinjenom Kraljevstvu ne mogu spasiti datoteke kolačića bez informativnog pristanka surfera.<br/><br/>To je nakon provedbe takvog zakona, web stranice sada imaju skočni prozor, koji traži pristanak posjetitelja za spremanje datoteka kolačića. - Takve datoteke koriste web stranice za analizu obrasca pregledavanja posjetitelja na temelju kojih se oglasi zatim objavljuju na korisničkom prozoru. Mislite li da takva pravila i propisi mogu spriječiti online krivotvorenje ili cyber kriminal? Tehnologija se razvila brzom brzinom, ali ipak ljudi ne vole kupovinu online zbog straha od hakovanja podataka o osobnim ili bankovnim računima. S porastom kibernetičkog kriminala, potreba strogih sajber zakona je također povećana kako bi se obuzdalo isto i promoviralo iskustvo besplatnog kupovine rizika.<br/><br/>Klase kibernetičkih zločina<br/><br/>- Tokom godina postojale su tri glavne klase kibernetičkih zločina:<br/><br/>- Neovlašteni pristup slučajevima računalnog sustava, koji uključuje hakovanje ili krađu korisničkih imena i lozinki kako bi se dobio pristup nad osobnim informacijama odgovarajućeg korisnika. Ova vrsta backdoor pristup su organizirani uz pomoć Trojanskog konja. Puštanje zlonamjernih programa poput Trojanske kuće, crva ili računalnih virusa itd. Posljednja klasa uključuje cyber uhođenje korisnika ili online uznemiravanje .<br/><br/>- Direktne implikacije kibernetičkih zločina<br/><br/>\"Smanjivanje prodaje\"<br/><br/>- Smanjenje izlaza osoblja zbog kašnjenja mreže<br/><br/>- Gubitak personaliziranih informacija kao što je istraživački rad<br/><br/>- Poremećaj u komunikacionom procesu<br/><br/>\"Indirektne implikacije kibernetičkih zločina\"<br/><br/>Pitanje vjerodostojnosti u našem financijskom sustavu<br/><br/>Brand slika je okaljana na tržištu<br/><br/>Cyber zločini utječu na poslovanje na poslovni odnos na tržištu<br/><br/>\"Osjećaj povjerenja u državne politike i vladine agencije je izgubljen<br/><br/>Sprečavanje kibernetičkog kriminala<br/><br/>Kako mreže postoje određene mjere opreza koje bismo trebali uzeti u obzir zbog sigurnog i sigurnog online iskustva.<br/><br/>Prva stvar koju treba uraditi je da zadržiš osobne podatke za sebe i izbjegneš dijeljenje istih na internetu.<br/><br/>- Izbjegavajte dijeljenje fotografija s online chat prijateljima ili strancima.<br/><br/>- Instaliranje najnovije verzije antivirusa na vašem sistemu može vam ponuditi dobru liniju odbrane od internet prijetnji kao što su virusi i malware.<br/><br/>- Zadržavanje vaših vrijednih podataka dobra je opcija za izbjegavanje problema kao što je kontaminacija virusom.<br/><br/>Izbjegavajte slanje informacija o kreditnoj kartici na stranice koje nisu osigurane i nemaju valjanu potvrdu.<br/><br/>- Instaliranje programa sigurnosti koji vam nudi kontrolu nad kolačićima i spašava vas od praćenja web stranica.<br/><br/>- Stavljanje uređaja za detekciju uređaja za detekciju na servere na bazi domaćina pomoći će vam da pratite nepravilnosti na vašem web prometu.<br/><br/>- Savjetuje se upotreba vatrozida.<br/><br/>Zašto su Cyber napadi tako popularni?<br/><br/>Jeftinije od tradicionalnih metoda varanja<br/><br/>Praćenje kibernetičkih zločina nije lako<br/><br/>Tačne lokacije se ne mogu lako pratiti.<br/><br/>Odsustvo fizičke barijere u svijetu interneta<br/><br/>Cyber-zločini utječu na velik broj ljudi<br/><br/>Zaključujem da je<br/><br/>- Činjenica da ljudski um ima nedokučivu moć je neosporna, zbog čega se zločini na internetu povećavaju ogromnom brzinom. \"Čak je i povijest svjedočila da su neki od najvećih internet osiguranja nestali od strane hakera, koji su se lako izvukli. Jedini način da obuzdamo takav kriminal je da ostanemo svjesni sajber zakona koje danas imamo, koji mogu biti preko interneta ili preko web-stranica/IT dobavljača. Zakon o informacijskoj tehnologiji mora biti uravnotežen na takav način da se pokaže prestrog za ljude koji su uključeni u kibernetičke zločine, a istovremeno ne smije ometati rast internetske industrije.<br/><br/>- Autor Bio: - Maneet Puri trenutno vodi kvalitetnu web dizajnersku firmu koja se nalazi u New Delhiju, Indija.
