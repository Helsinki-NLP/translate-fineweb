| Concussion: Using Cooling Helmets to Combat Brain Injuries in College Football<br/><br/>Former football player Kevin Jackson uses brain cooling technology in the hopes of reducing the effects of traumatic brain injuries and sports-related concussions.<br/>Jackson was a running back for the University of Illinois from 1990-1994. In addition to suffering a number of injuries to his body during his playing days, Jackson also suffered a number of un-diagnosed concussions. Now a research scientist and injury spotter, Jackson uses his experience as a player to help him understand and combat brain trauma in sports.<br/>This video illustrates the chain of events that occur when a traumatic brain injury happens, explores how concussion symptoms very from person to person, highlights the need to protect oneself from repeated head traumas, and shows how using cooling technologies might aide in recovery from injury.<br/>To learn more about this research, please visit...<br/> | - Potres mozga: Korištenje hladne kacige za borbu protiv ozljeda mozga u nogometu na koledžu<br/><br/>Bivši nogometaš Kevin Jackson koristi tehnologiju hlađenja mozga u nadi da će smanjiti efekte traumatskih ozljeda mozga i potresa mozga povezanih sa sportom.<br/>Jackson je od 1990.-1994. bio trkač za Sveučilište u Illinoisu, osim što je zadobio brojne ozljede tijela tijekom igranja, Jackson je također zadobio niz nedijagnosticiranih potresa mozga.

| Massage Therapy<br/><br/>Massage is perhaps one of the oldest healing traditions. Many ancient peoples – including the Ancient Greeks, Egyptians, Chinese and Indians – were convinced of the therapeutic properties of massage and used it to treat a variety of ailments.<br/><br/>Massage therapy is the practice of kneading or manipulating a person's muscles and other soft-tissue in order to improve their wellbeing or health. It is a form of manual therapy that includes holding, moving, and applying pressure to the muscles, tendons, ligaments and fascia.<br/><br/>The term 'massage therapy' is used to describe a wide variety of techniques that vary in the manner in which touch, pressure and the intensity of the treatment is applied.<br/><br/>Massage for treatment of some disorders<br/><br/>Research indicates that massage and myotherapy are effective in managing:<br/><br/>subacute/chronic low back pain<br/><br/>delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS)<br/><br/>anxiety<br/><br/>stress<br/><br/>soft tissue injuries<br/><br/>high blood pressure<br/><br/>insomnia.<br/><br/>They can also be effectively used to support people with:<br/><br/>a chronic disease<br/><br/>a life threatening illness such as cancer.<br/><br/>Benefits of massage<br/><br/>One of the immediate benefits of massage is a feeling of deep relaxation and calm. This occurs because massage prompts the release of endorphins – the brain chemicals (neurotransmitters) that produce feelings of wellbeing.<br/><br/>Levels of stress hormones, such as adrenalin, cortisol and norepinephrine, are also reduced. Studies indicate that high levels of stress hormones impair the immune system.<br/><br/>Some of the physical benefits of massage and myotherapy include:<br/><br/>reduced muscle tension<br/><br/>improved circulation<br/><br/>stimulation of the lymphatic system<br/><br/>reduction of stress hormones<br/><br/>relaxation<br/><br/>increased joint mobility and flexibility<br/><br/>improved skin tone<br/><br/>improved recovery of soft tissue injuries<br/><br/>heightened mental alertness<br/><br/>reduced anxiety and depression | - Masažna terapija<br/><br/>Mnogi drevni narodi, uključujući stare Grke, Egipćane, Kineze i Indijance, bili su uvjereni u terapeutska svojstva masaže i koristili je za liječenje raznih bolesti.<br/><br/>- Terapija masažom je praksa umiješavanja ili manipulacije nečijim mišićima i drugim mekim tkivom kako bi se poboljšala dobrobit ili zdravlje. - To je oblik ručne terapije koja uključuje držanje, kretanje i nanošenje pritiska na mišiće, tetive, ligamente i fasciju.<br/><br/>- Termin masažna terapija se koristi za opisivanje širokog niza tehnika koje variraju na način na koji se primjenjuje dodir, pritisak i intenzitet liječenja.<br/><br/>- Masaža za liječenje nekih poremećaja<br/><br/>Istraživanje pokazuje da su masaža i mioterapija djelotvorni u upravljanju:<br/><br/>- subakutni/kronični bol u leđima<br/><br/>- odgođena bol u mišićima (DOMS)<br/><br/>- Nervoza.<br/><br/>Naprezanje<br/><br/>- ozljede mekog tkiva<br/><br/>- visok krvni tlak<br/><br/>- Nesanica.<br/><br/>Oni se također mogu učinkovito koristiti za podršku ljudima sa:<br/><br/>kronična bolest<br/><br/>- bolest opasna po život kao što je rak.<br/><br/>- Prednosti masaže<br/><br/>Jedna od neposrednih prednosti masaže je osjećaj duboke relaksacije i smirenosti, a to se događa jer masaža potiče oslobađanje endorfina - moždanih kemikalija (transmitera) koje proizvode osjećaj blagostanja.<br/><br/>Nivo hormona stresa, kao što su adrenalin, kortizol i norepinefrin, također je smanjen.<br/><br/>neke od fizičkih prednosti masaže i mioterapije uključuju:<br/><br/>\"Smanjena napetost mišića\"<br/><br/>- poboljšana cirkulacija<br/><br/>- stimulacija limfnog sistema<br/><br/>- smanjenje hormona stresa<br/><br/>opuštanje<br/><br/>- povećana zajednička mobilnost i fleksibilnost<br/><br/>poboljsani ton kože<br/><br/>- poboljšan oporavak povreda mekog tkiva<br/><br/>- pojačana mentalna budnost<br/><br/>- smanjena anksioznost i depresija |

| Mistakes happen and it can be a long road to recovery when it comes to rebuilding credit.<br/><br/>The Shopping Cart trick is useful for people who have:<br/><br/>1. Declared bankruptcy in the past and is trying to recover 2. Defaulted on payments in the past 3. A lot of credit inquiries and doesn't want to add more inquiries 4. Made late payments in the past and had their accounts closed because of this 5. Someone who doesn't have a credit score at all<br/><br/>The caveat is If they ask you to enter your whole social security number, and not just the last 4, then it will most likely be a hard inquiry. With anything mentioned in this post, your mileage may vary, so it may work for some people and not for others.<br/><br/>If you use this method and have defaulted on payments in the past, be sure to pay off your bills every month.<br/><br/>The Shopping Cart Trick<br/><br/>The Shopping Cart Trick is visiting a website and waiting for a credit card offer to pop up when you check out. You do not need to purchase anything, it will appear before the payment page. This method only works for certain stores.<br/><br/>A few examples are Express, Overstock.com, and Williams-Sonoma. There are a few Synchrony cards like Walmart and QVC that work as well. Full list of stores can be found at the end of this post.<br/><br/>When you go through the process, be sure to have the ad blocker turned off and enter your real address. If the store can't match the last 4 digits of your SSN with your address, then the soft pull won't work. Again, you might have to go through the shopping process a few times before you receive an offer. You don't have to buy anything.<br/><br/>The credit limits might be lower for some people, but the idea is to rebuild your credit. If you do choose to go through this process, I recommend picking stores you will actually shop. It doesn't make sense to get a bonus or points at a store you don't shop at. Most, if not all of the cards, don't have annual fees, so they are good as foundation cards.<br/><br/>For me, this trick doesn't work out well because I don't frequent the listed shops often | Greške se događaju i može biti dug put do oporavka kada je riječ o obnovi kredita.<br/><br/>Trik sa kupovinom je koristan za ljude koji imaju:<br/><br/>Proglašen bankrotom u prošlosti i pokušava se oporaviti 2. Defaulted na plaćanja u proteklih 3. Puno kreditnih upita i ne želi dodati više upite 4. Izvršili kasne uplate u prošlosti i zatvorili svoje račune zbog ovog 5. Neko ko uopšte nema kreditni rezultat.<br/><br/>Ako vas zatraže da unesete cijeli broj socijalnog osiguranja, a ne samo zadnjih 4, onda će to vjerojatno biti teška istraga, s bilo čim što se spominje u ovom postu, vaša kilometraža može varirati, tako da može djelovati i za neke ljude, a ne za druge.<br/><br/>Ako koristite ovu metodu i u prošlosti niste plaćali plaćanje, plaćajte račune svaki mjesec.<br/><br/>Trik sa kupovinom automobila<br/><br/>Trik za kupovinu automobila posjećuje web stranicu i čeka ponudu kreditne kartice da iskoči kada se odjavite.<br/><br/>Nekoliko primjera su Express, Overstock.com i Williams-Sonoma. Postoji nekoliko sinkronističkih kartica poput Walmarta i QVC-a koje također djeluju. Potpuni popis trgovina se može naći na kraju ovog post-a.<br/><br/>Kada prođete kroz proces, obavezno isključite blokator oglasa i unesite svoju pravu adresu. Možda ćete morati proći kroz proces kupovine nekoliko puta prije nego primite ponudu.<br/><br/>Kreditne granice su možda niže za neke ljude, ali ideja je da obnovite kredit. Nema smisla dobiti bonus ili bodove u trgovini u kojoj ne kupuješ.<br/><br/>Za mene, ovaj trik ne ide dobro jer ne posjećujem često navedene trgovine. |
| Composition in Design – 15 Things You Can't Afford NOT to Know<br/><br/>Composition is one of the six crucial elements of design. Without strong and solid design composition, everything starts falling apart.<br/><br/>In this article we will give you 15 tips on how to strengthen your composition – no matter if it's a photography, illustration or any graphic design project.<br/><br/>We also prepared a beautiful collection of designs in the end, for your inspirarion. Enjoy!<br/><br/>1 . Direct the eye with leading lines<br/><br/>Usually, when you look at any visual, your eye falls first on particular object. In this case, this is the car and it is the focal point of the poster. We will talk a little bit more in our second point of the article. But if your eyes are immidiatelt attracted to certain part of visual, where do you look next? That is a tough question to start with, but a simple answer would be – you look where your eyes lead you. And your eyes lead you, where the designer uses leading lines to direct you through the layout. In this case, a leading line is the road. It also nicely frames the text on the left side and leads your eye back to the focal point of the poster.<br/><br/>Often lines can be more obvious then here, directly using arrows, flowcharts and are very useful method for explaining information and sequences.<br/><br/>2. Create focus in your design composition<br/><br/>A key element to design composition is having a strong focal point. No matter how many elements you have in your design, you have to stress and show the viewer, which is the most important part of your piece. In this case, the artist used color, contrast and scale to organize the space and create focal point. Keep in mind that the most important role of design is to communicate. Therefore, your focal point would be also your most important statement and message to your audience!<br/><br/>3. Use hierachy<br/><br/>Once that you've created your focal point, you have to figure out what to do with the rest of the elements of your design composition. Of course, you have structure these elements as well, and set a priority to them. In this example, the focal point is the man in the picture. Then, we have to look for a name of the event, what is the whole thing about. Only after that, we can keep looking for additional info, such as subheadings, dates, numbers, etc.<br/><br/>All this organization of the information with the help of size, color, weight is called hierachy.<br/><br/>4. Use complementing elements<br/><br/>Always seek to create unifed look throughout your entire design. It is not a good idea to mix and match images from different sources, with no simillarities in style between them. This will only tire the eyes of the viewer and confuse him/her.<br/><br/>This website design is a great example of cohesiveness between the images – they all have simple, one color background and the object are placed in the center. Of course, your design solution would depend on the specific project need.<br/><br/>In this case, you want the viewer to recognize and focus easily on the item to be bought, without any other distraction. The overal feel of the top image and color scheme is also repeated in the backgrounds of the products, so this is one more nice connection between the different parts of the design!<br/><br/>5. Repeat elements<br/><br/>Often your projects will consist of more than one page. If you repeat specific elements from one section of your design to another, you will help the viewer to orientate himself/ herself easier across the design.<br/><br/>Repeating elements are often used to create a certain theme as well and again, help the designcomposition to "stick together".<br/><br/>Some of the repeating elements you could use are: graphic motifs, type, cetrain layout reused in the different pages/parts of your project.<br/><br/>6. Balance elements<br/><br/>There are two types of balance in design composition – symmetrical and asymmetrical. The first uses similar elements, mirrored (distributed equally) on the both sides of an axis (visible or non-visible line). Symmetrical balance is very clean and elegant, but sometimes it can get a bit boring, so then, designers prefer asymmetrical balance instead. Obviously, in this scenario we won't have equal in size elements, placed in similar way.<br/><br/>Here, we look at the different sizes of the elements, the textures and so on. It helps to think of a design elements, as they have "weight". Larger elements would be "heavier". For example, if you have a big, "heavy", vertically pointing pumpkin, you can "balance" it out by using several horizontal lines and smaller objects on the opposite side of the "heavy" object.<br/><br/>7. Align elements<br/><br/>Alignment is another important tool to use in design composition and organize your elements. It often comes handy wen you have a lot of types, colors, images, headings and subheadings. There are many tools on the web, which can help you to snap and align elements to each other, leaving no room for floating pieces and messy design. Alignment brings an elegant vibe to a design. Even the most asymetric designs have some sorts of alignment and structuring of similar blocks of content.<br/><br/>It is a general rule, that when you have a long blocks of texts, left alignment would help the eye to scan more easily teh content. This poster is great visualization of this concept.<br/><br/>8. Use contrast<br/><br/>Contrast is used for drawing attention. If you boost the contrast of an element, this will make it pop. On the contrary, using elements with lower contrast will make them fade and "disappear".<br/><br/>Here, the contrast underlines the strong, geometic, bold architectural forms and the play of light and shadow. Not on last place, the small figure might be with lower contrast, compared to other elements, but it is still visible and nicely balances out the big, dark shape at the opposite, top left corner.<br/><br/>9. Use white space<br/><br/>White space is unreplacable tool in bringing clarity into your design composition. White space is not an "empty space", but necessary element, allowing your design to breathe. It also helps emphasizing the subject of interest.<br/><br/>For example, in this photo, all the white space (unoccupied by other elements) helps to focus all the attention on the woman figure and her posture. Do you think you would pay attention to this woman, if the image was filled in with many other elements? To help you understand the importance of white space, thinks of your own room. How would you feel if you have only one small passage from the door to the bed and everything is piled up with objects? How would you feel, if your bed doesn't not fill the whole room and there are no objects all around the place. Yes, you get the ideas – we all need space, even the design does.<br/><br/>10. Understand and use type of layouts<br/><br/>The first one we are going to look at is the so called, big photo or single visual layout which was was very popular for web designers in the recent years. It gives elegant, clean look, usually highlights a product or service with the help of single high-quality, engaging photo. This type of layout gives a sense of space. As you can suggest, it is not commonly used for news sites, where there is a lot of information to be presented. Here key phrase is quality over quantity.<br/><br/>Key elements to this type of layout are white space and simple typo.<br/><br/>Another type of layout is the Z layout. This is where the eye of the viewer is lead from one element of the design to other.<br/><br/>In this example we naturally first look at the photo, than our eyes are drawn to the text on the right side of the visual and then we continue scanning down, jumping from visual to text. Z layouts create rhythm and are often used on website with lot of information, where you have to orientate the user and "guide" him.<br/><br/>Another way to keep things nice, neat and organized is to use the so called golden ratio or rule of thirds. You can read more about in our article for taking amazing photos, where the same principle applies to photography. In short, dividing your layout into thirds – both vertically and horizontally and placing most important elements where these lines cross, will make your design more visually pleasing.<br/><br/>The example here is MailChimp's website. Notice how the monkey character is slightly to the left? It simply looks good! Oh, and one more thing – when you move a character across space, move it from left to right.<br/><br/>11. Create movement<br/><br/>Movement is change of place or position, an effort. It can be actual motion or it can be implied — arranging parts of the image so that the viewer gets a sense of motion by using lines, shapes, forms, textures, etc.<br/><br/>Since ancient times our eyes are more attracted to moving objects than still ones, and this was important for one's survival – in hunting and protecting yourself from animals. That is why, people are very attracted to images that depict movement and respectively, a composition with nice "flow" of elements is more intriguing.<br/><br/>12. People like triangles<br/><br/>The shape of triangle creates interest, sets a direction and creates movement. Surely, it is a very strong shape and designers and artists use it to organize their layout as well, and not only as visual element. In the recent years, it became hugely popular with the polygon design.<br/><br/>13. Simplification<br/><br/>Simplification is the technique of reducing a composition to only the most essential elements that support the visual statement.<br/><br/>If every part is equally important, then every part is equally unimportant. Nathan Fowkes<br/><br/>It is natural for the eyes to look at details, but it is very hard to see the design as whole and how all elements work together. When in doubt, better remove elements from your design composition, rather adding and trying to find a place for them. We know it's a cliche – but it is still legit "Less is more"!<br/><br/>14. See where your elements are in relation to edges<br/><br/>Often, you will see designers using blank space around the edges of the layout, giving the design room to breathe. Again it is natural to the eye to see elements receeding around edges and fading out. If it is busy around the edges in your design – the overal feel would be of something heavy, big and it will take away from the attention of central elements.<br/><br/>In this case, the designer used large, abstract shape to underline the typo – yeard and names. Because the shape is directing the eye, varied in thickness and has sense of movement to it, it doesn't overwhelm the viewer, but on the contrary – offers him/her aesthetic pleasure and simplicity.<br/><br/>15. Mind the transitions<br/><br/>Transition in design composition is a little bit harder to define. We discussed repetition already, in comparison, transition handles the natural flow from one shape to another, leading the eye from one spot to another. Often, designers use curved lines and shapes to smoothen transition from more angular shapes and blocks of content. Transition helps to relax the eye and "soften" the design.<br/><br/>Looking for some inspiration?<br/><br/>Now that you learnt something about the most important ingredients of good design composition, we made a small gallery with design compositions we find inspiring. Enjoy | Sastav u dizajnu - 15 stvari koje ne možeš prihvatiti da ne znaš<br/><br/>Sastav je jedan od šest ključnih elemenata dizajna, bez snažnog i čvrstog dizajna, sve se počinje raspadati.<br/><br/>U ovom članku dat ćemo vam 15 savjeta kako ojačati vašu kompoziciju - bez obzira da li je riječ o fotografiji, ilustraciji ili bilo kojem projektu grafičkog dizajna.<br/><br/>Pripremili smo i divnu kolekciju dizajna na kraju, za vašu inspiratoriju.<br/><br/>1. Usmjeri oko vodećim linijama<br/><br/>U ovom slučaju, ovo je auto i to je žarišna točka plakata. To je teško pitanje za početak, ali jednostavan odgovor bi bio da gledaš kuda te oči vode. U ovom slučaju, vodeća linija je cesta, a također lijepo uokviruje tekst s lijeve strane i vodi oko natrag do žarišne točke plakata.<br/><br/>često linije mogu biti očitije onda ovdje, izravno koristeći strelice, tok-čarte i vrlo su korisna metoda za objašnjavanje informacija i sekvenci.<br/><br/>2. Stvorite fokus u svom dizajnu kompozicije<br/><br/>Ključni element za dizajn kompozicije je imati jaku žarišnu točku bez obzira na to koliko elemenata imate u dizajnu, morate naglasiti i pokazati gledatelju, koji je najvažniji dio vašeg djela. U ovom slučaju, umjetnik je koristio boju, kontrast i skalu kako bi organizirao prostor i stvorio žarišnu točku. Dakle, vaša žarišna tačka bila bi i vaša najvažnija izjava i poruka vašoj publici!<br/><br/>- 3. Koristi hijerarhiju<br/><br/>Nakon što stvorite žarišnu točku, morate shvatiti što učiniti s ostalim elementima vašeg dizajna kompozicije. U ovom primjeru, žarišna točka je čovjek na slici, a onda moramo potražiti ime događaja, o čemu se radi, tek nakon toga možemo nastaviti tražiti dodatne informacije, kao što su podnaslovi, datumi, brojevi itd.<br/><br/>- Sva ta organizacija informacija uz pomoć veličine, boje, težine zove se hierachy.<br/><br/>4. Koristite komplementarne elemente<br/><br/>Nije dobra ideja miješati i podudarati slike iz različitih izvora, bez sličnosti u stilu između njih, to će samo umoriti oči gledatelja i zbuniti ga.<br/><br/>Ovaj dizajn web stranica je odličan primjer kohezivnosti između slika - sve imaju jednostavnu pozadinu, jednu boju pozadine i objekt su smješteni u centru.<br/><br/>- U ovom slučaju, želite da gledateljica prepozna i fokusira se lako na predmet koji treba kupiti, bez ikakve druge distrakcije. - Pretjerani osjećaj gornje slike i sheme boja također se ponavlja u pozadini proizvoda, tako da je ovo još jedna lijepa veza između različitih dijelova dizajna!<br/><br/>5. Ponovni elementi<br/><br/>Često će se vaši projekti sastojati od više stranica. Ako ponavljate specifične elemente iz jednog dijela vašeg dizajna u drugi, pomoći ćete gledatelju da se lakše orijentira preko dizajna.<br/><br/>Ponavljajući elementi često se koriste i za stvaranje određene teme, kao i opet, pomažu dizajnu da se drži zajedno<br/><br/>- Neki od ponavljajućih elemenata koje biste mogli koristiti su: grafički motivi, tip, izgled cetrena koji se ponovno koriste u različitim stranicama/dijelovima vašeg projekta.<br/><br/>6. Balansirani elementi<br/><br/>Prvi koristi slične elemente, zrcaljene (rasprostranjene jednako) na obje strane osi (vidljive ili nevidljive linije). Simetrična ravnoteža je vrlo čista i elegantna, ali ponekad može postati pomalo dosadna, pa dizajneri umjesto nje preferiraju asimetričnu ravnotežu.Očito, u ovom scenariju nećemo imati jednake elemente veličine, postavljene na sličan način.<br/><br/>Ovdje gledamo različite veličine elemenata, teksture i tako dalje, pomaže razmišljati o elementima dizajna, kao što imaju težinu, veći elementi bi bili teži. Na primjer, ako imate veliku, tešku, vertikalno usmjerenu bundevu, možete je izbalansirati koristeći nekoliko horizontalnih linija i manjih objekata na suprotnoj strani objekta.<br/><br/>7. Poravnanje elemenata<br/><br/>- Poravnanje je još jedan važan alat za korištenje u dizajnu kompozicije i organiziranje vaših elemenata. Često dolazi pri ruci wen imate puno tipova, boja, slika, naslova i naslova. Postoji mnogo alata na webu, koji vam mogu pomoći da trgnete i uskladite elemente jedni s drugima, ne ostavljajući mjesta za plutajuće komade i neuredan dizajn. - Čak i većina asimetrijskih dizajna ima neku vrstu poravnanja i strukturiranja sličnih blokova sadržaja.<br/><br/>Općenito je pravilo da kada imate dugačke blokove tekstova, lijevo poravnanje bi pomoglo oku da lakše skenira sadržaj teha.<br/><br/>- 8. Koristi kontrast<br/><br/>Kontrast se koristi za privlačenje pažnje. Ako pojačate kontrast nekog elementa, to će ga učiniti otvorenim. Naprotiv, korištenjem elemenata s nižim kontrastom će ih izblijediti i nestati.<br/><br/>- Ovdje kontrast naglašava jake, geometičke, odvažne arhitektonske oblike i igru svjetlosti i sjene. - Ne na zadnjem mjestu, mala figura može biti s nižim kontrastom, u odnosu na druge elemente, ali je još uvijek vidljiva i lijepo balansira veliki, tamni oblik na suprotnom, gornjem lijevom uglu.<br/><br/>9. Koristite bijeli prostor<br/><br/>Bijeli prostor nije prazan prostor, već neophodan element koji omogućuje vašem dizajnu da diše.<br/><br/>Na primjer, na ovoj fotografiji, sav bijeli prostor (nezauzet drugim elementima) pomaže fokusirati svu pažnju na žensku figuru i njeno držanje. Kako biste se osjećali da imate samo jedan mali prolaz od vrata do kreveta i sve je nagomilano predmetima? Kako bi se ti osjećao, ako tvoj krevet ne popuni cijelu sobu i nema predmeta svuda uokolo.<br/><br/>- 10. Razumjeti i koristiti vrstu rasporeda<br/><br/>Prvi koji ćemo pogledati je takozvani, veliki ili pojedinačni vizuelni raspored koji je bio vrlo popularan za web dizajnere posljednjih godina. Daje elegantan, čist izgled, obično ističe proizvod ili uslugu uz pomoć jedinstvene visokokvalitetne, angažovane fotografije. Kao što možete predložiti, obično se ne koristi za novinske stranice, gdje ima mnogo informacija koje treba predstaviti.<br/><br/>- Ključni elementi za ovu vrstu rasporeda su bijeli prostor i jednostavna tipska tipka.<br/><br/>Ovo je mjesto gdje oko gledatelja vodi iz jednog elementa dizajna u drugi.<br/><br/>- U ovom primjeru, naravno, prvo pogledamo fotografiju, nego što su nam oči nacrtane tekstom s desne strane vida, a zatim nastavljamo skenirati prema dolje, skačući s vizualnog na tekst. Z rasporedi stvaraju ritam i često se koriste na web stranici s puno informacija, gdje morate orijentirati korisnika i voditi ga.<br/><br/>Drugi način da stvari budu lijepe, uredne i organizirane je korištenje tzv. zlatnog omjera ili pravila trećina. Možete pročitati više o našem članku za fotografiranje nevjerojatnih fotografija, gdje se isti princip odnosi na fotografiju. Ukratko, dijeljenje vašeg rasporeda na trećine - kako okomito tako i horizontalno i postavljanje najvažnijih elemenata gdje se ove linije ukrste, učinit će vaš dizajn vizualno ugodnijim.<br/><br/>Primjećujete kako je majmunski lik malo ulijevo?<br/><br/>11. Kreirati kretanje<br/><br/>To može biti stvarno gibanje ili se može podrazumijevati — aranžiranje dijelova slike tako da gledatelj dobije osjećaj gibanja koristeći linije, oblike, oblike, teksture i sl.<br/><br/>Od davnina naše oči više privlače pokretne objekte nego ostale, a to je bilo važno za opstanak osobe u lovu i zaštiti sebe od životinja. Zbog toga, ljude veoma privlače slike koje prikazuju pokrete i to, kompozicija sa lijepim protokom elemenata je intrigantnija.<br/><br/>12. Ljudi vole trokute<br/><br/>Oblik trokuta stvara interes, postavlja smjer i stvara pokrete, sigurno je vrlo jak oblik i dizajneri i umjetnici ga koriste za organiziranje njihova rasporeda, a ne samo kao vizualni element. - Posljednjih godina, postala je iznimno popularna u poligonskom dizajnu.<br/><br/>13. Pojednostavnjenje<br/><br/>Pojednostavnjenje je tehnika smanjenja kompozicije na samo najosnovnije elemente koji podržavaju vizuelnu izjavu.<br/><br/>Ako je svaki dio jednako važan, onda je svaki dio jednako nevažan.<br/><br/>Prirodno je da oči gledaju na detalje, ali je vrlo teško vidjeti dizajn kao cjelinu i kako svi elementi rade zajedno. Znamo da je klišej, ali ipak je legalan. Manje je više.<br/><br/>14. Pogledajte gdje su vaši elementi u odnosu na rubove<br/><br/>Često ćete vidjeti dizajnere kako koriste prazan prostor oko rubova rasporeda, dajući dizajnerskoj sobi da diše. - Ako je zauzet oko rubova u vašem dizajnu - pretjerani osjećaj bi bio od nečega teškog, velikog i to će odvući pažnju centralnih elemenata.<br/><br/>U ovom slučaju, dizajner je koristio veliki, apstraktni oblik kako bi podvukao tipsku tipografiju - godišnju i nazive. - Zato što oblik usmjerava oko, raznolike debljine i ima osjećaj kretanja prema njemu, ne preplavljuje gledatelja, ali naprotiv - nudi mu/njezino estetsko zadovoljstvo i jednostavnost.<br/><br/>15. Pazite na prijelaze<br/><br/>Tranzicija u dizajnu kompozicije je malo teže definirati.Razgovarali smo o ponavljanju već, u usporedbi s tim, prijelaz upravlja prirodnim tokom iz jednog oblika u drugi, vodeći oko s jednog mjesta na drugo. Često dizajneri koriste zakrivljene linije i oblike kako bi izgladili prijelaz iz kutnih oblika i blokova sadržaja.<br/><br/>Tražiš neku inspiraciju?<br/><br/>Sada kada ste saznali nešto o najvažnijim sastojcima dobrog dizajna kompozicije, napravili smo malu galeriju sa dizajnerskim kompozicijama koje su nam inspirativne. |

| Memory CD8+ T cells are essential cells of the immune system, retained post infection to protect from subsequent immunological insults. Many transcriptional regulators and some proximal signaling cascades associated with both naive and memory T cells have been described and have greatly informed the process by which immunological memory is formed. Despite clear differences in transcription factor expression and cytokine requirements, how global signal transduction induced by antigen binding differs between naive and memory CD8+ T cells is completely unknown and thus represents a significant gap in our knowledge base. One key signaling event that occurs in response to TCR stimulation is the activation of kinases that phosphorylate tyrosine residues on downstream signaling proteins. Therefore, comparing the phosphotyrosine signaling networks between naive and memory T cells will identify targets for modulation of the CD8+ T cell immune response to positively influence response to disease and vaccine efficacy. The objective of this specific proposal is to determine the intracellular signaling pathways that are unique to restimulated memory CD8+ T cells. Our central hypothesis is that distinct signal transduction pathways regulate the memory CD8+ T cell response. The rationale and scientific premise for the proposed work is that understanding at a global proteomic level the changes that occur in T cells as they differentiate from naive to memory T cells will enable more efficacious vaccine and drug treatment design to combat disease and infection. We will test our central hypothesis with the following specific aims: 1) Determine the TCR signal transduction changes that occur in CD8+ nave and memory T cells. To profile kinase signaling networks, we will utilize a highly sensitive quantitative mass spectrometric assay we developed on naive, effector and memory CD8+ T cells. Based on a preliminary screen, we identified that Jak2 is hyperphosphorylated, indicating it is a key mediator of the recall response. We will test the hypothesis that Jak2 hyperactivation is critical for memory recall responses. Together, the completion of Aim1 will identify novel signaling networks that contribute to CD8+ memory recall responses and 2) Defining phosphorylation of CREB binding protein (CBP) as a molecular switch that regulates transcriptional networks in memory CD8+ T cells. Given our preliminary data in which we uncovered unique signaling pathways associated with CD8+ memory T cell formation, we hypothesize that in memory CD8+ T cells, increased Jak2 activation drives phosphorylation of CBP to promote a unique transcriptional landscape versus a nave T cell. We will identify how phosphorylation of CBP regulates binding of transcription factors such as CREB and MYB. Additionally, we will take a genetic approach to determine how CBP functions in the formation of CD8+ memory cells and CD8+ memory recall responses. Together, data obtained in this Aim2 will establish a novel mechanism that explains how changes in tyrosine kinase activity associated with CD8+ T cell memory formation drive unique transcriptional programs.<br/><br/>Public Health Relevance<br/><br/>The studies proposed herein will determine, using mass spectrometry, the signal transduction events that take place in memory CD8+ T cells upon restimulation, relative to nave CD8+ T cells. Given that these cells play an essential role in protection from secondary infection, it is imperative that we understand the molecular mechanisms by which these cells exert their effector function for the protection of human health. | - Memorijske CD8+ T stanice su esencijalne stanice imunološkog sustava, zadržane nakon infekcije radi zaštite od naknadnih imunoloških uvreda. Mnogi transkripcijski regulatori i neke proksimalne signalizirajuće kaskade povezane s naivnim i memorijskim T stanicama su opisani i uvelike su obaviješteni o procesu kojim se formira imunološka memorija. - Unatoč jasnim razlikama u ekspresiji transkripcijskih faktora i zahtjevima citokina, kako globalna transdukcija signala izazvana vezanjem antigena razlikuje se između naivnih i memorijskih CD8+ T stanica je potpuno nepoznata i na taj način predstavlja značajan jaz u našoj bazi znanja. Jedan ključni signalni događaj koji se javlja kao odgovor na TCR stimulaciju je aktivacija kinaza koje fosforiliraju tirozinske ostatke na nizvodne signalizirajuće proteine. Uspoređujući mreže signalizacije fosfotirozina između naivnih i memorijskih T stanica identificirat će ciljeve za modulaciju imunološkog odgovora CD8+ T stanica na pozitivan utjecaj na odgovor na bolest i djelotvornost cjepiva. Cilj ovog konkretnog prijedloga je odrediti unutarstanične signalne puteve koji su jedinstveni za restimulirane memorijske CD8+ T stanice. Naša središnja hipoteza je da različiti signalni transdukcijski putevi reguliraju memorijski CD8+ T odgovor. Racionalna i znanstvena pretpostavka za predloženi rad je da razumijevanje na globalnoj proteomskoj razini promjene koje se događaju u T stanicama jer se razlikuju od naivnih do memorijskih T stanica omogućit će učinkovitije cijepljenje i dizajn liječenja lijekovima za borbu protiv bolesti i infekcije. - Testirat ćemo našu centralnu hipotezu sa sljedećim specifičnim ciljevima: 1) Odredite promjene transdukcije TCR signala koje se javljaju u CD8+ nave i memorijskim T stanicama. Za profiliranje kinaza signalnih mreža, koristit ćemo visoko osjetljivi kvantitativni maseni spektrometrijski test koji smo razvili na naivnim, efektornim i memorijskim CD8+ T stanicama. Na osnovu preliminarnog ekrana utvrdili smo da je Jak2 hiperfosforiran, što ukazuje na to da je ključni posrednik odgovora opoziva. Zajedno, završetak Aim1 će identificirati nove signalizirajuće mreže koje doprinose odgovoru CD8+ memorije i 2) Definiranje fosforilacije proteina vezanja CREB-a (CBP) kao molekularnog prekidača koji regulira transkripcijske mreže u memorijskim CD8+ T stanicama. - S obzirom na naše preliminarne podatke u kojima smo otkrili jedinstvene signalne puteve povezane s formiranjem CD8+ memorijske T ćelije, hipoteziramo da u memoriji CD8+ T stanice, povećana aktivacija Jak2 pogoni fosforilaciju CBP-a promoviraju jedinstveni transkripcijski krajolik naspram nave T ćelije. Identificirat ćemo kako fosforilacija CBP regulira vezivanje transkripcijskih faktora poput CREB-a i MYB-a. Osim toga, uzet ćemo genetski pristup kako bismo utvrdili kako CBP funkcionira u formiranju CD8+ memorijskih stanica i CD8+ memorijskih odgovora. - Zajedno, podaci dobiveni u ovom Aim2 uspostavit će novi mehanizam koji objašnjava kako promjene aktivnosti tirozin kinaze povezane s CD8+ T formiranjem ćelijske memorije pogon jedinstvenih transkripcijskih programa.<br/><br/>Javnozdravstveni relevantnost<br/><br/>- U ovim studijama utvrdit će se, pomoću masene spektrometrije, događaji transdukcije signala koji se odvijaju u memorijskim CD8+ T stanicama nakon restimulacije, u odnosu na nave CD8+ T stanice. S obzirom na to da te stanice igraju bitnu ulogu u zaštiti od sekundarne infekcije, imperativ je da razumijemo molekularne mehanizme pomoću kojih te stanice vrše svoju efektorsku funkciju za zaštitu ljudskog zdravlja. |
