| New Officer Training<br/><br/>Event Overview<br/><br/>This four-day virtual training covers community-oriented policing, cultural responsiveness, the role of school-based officers, and an introduction to Law Related Education (LRE) as an essential prevention tool. Day 1 begins with Leadership 100, where SROs and JPOs will attend training with their administrator(s). Attending this training together encourages program cohesion and effective program implementation. Day 2 covers child development, trauma-informed practices, working with students in special education, and cultural responsiveness. Days 3 and 4 do a deep dive into LRE providing officers with classroom management techniques, space to share ideas and lesson plan, and knowledge of learning styles. Officers leave with resources and tools ready to teach in the classroom.<br/><br/>ThisOfficers NEW to the program in FY 2022 OR who joined the program in FY 2021 but did not attend the New Officer Training in FY 2021 OR who were not on the last grant cycle (FY18-FY20). | Nova časnička obuka<br/><br/>Pregled događaja<br/><br/>Ova četverodnevna virtualna obuka pokriva lokalno orijentisanu policiju, kulturnu responzibilnost, ulogu školskih službenika, te uvod u pravo povezano obrazovanje (LRE) kao suštinski alat za prevenciju. Prvi dan počinje vodstvom 100, gdje će SRO-ovi i JPO-ovi pohađati obuku sa svojim administratorima. Pohađanje ove obuke zajedno potiče programsku koheziju i učinkovitu implementaciju programa. 2. dan pokriva razvoj djece, trauma-informirane prakse, rad sa studentima u specijalnom obrazovanju, i kulturni odgovor. 3. i 4. dani duboko zaronite u LRE pružajući časnicima tehnike upravljanja učionicama, prostor za dijeljenje ideja i plana lekcije, te poznavanje stilova učenja.

The ambiguity arises from the fact that static pressure can be used, correctly, to refer to the free-stream pressure in external flows, but it is more often, and not always correctly, used to refer to the pressure in a generic point of a flow field, typically when discussing the Bernoulli equation. In order to avoid ambiguity, alternative expressions that could be used, depending on the context, are free-stream pressure, fluid pressure, thermodynamic pressure or often just pressure.<br/><br/>Equivalence of static and free-stream pressure<br/><br/>We consider as an example the atmosphere, at rest relatively to the ground. An observer standing on the ground would see a generic fluid element as not moving, and subject to the local static pressure (which, in this case, is the atmospheric pressure).<br/>We now consider an aircraft that flies straight and level with speed (airspeed and ground speed are the same, in this example), approaching the same fluid element from great distance. The distance is such that the fluid element is not perturbed by the approaching aircraft. To an observer on board the aircraft, the fluid element, like all the fluid elements at the same distance, appears as being in free-stream conditions, where all the fluid elements flow straight towards the aircraft with the same constant velocity and there are no pressure gradients inside the fluid (that is the pressure is constant anywhere in that region of fluid).[4] Given that the fluid element is the same for both observers, so is the pressure to which the element is subject, therefore what an observer at rest calls static pressure is in fact the free-stream pressure to an observer moving relatively to the fluid. This is the only case in fluid dynamics where, strictly speaking, the expression static pressure can be used appropriately[citation needed], i.e. to refer to the free-stream pressure.<br/>Note that when the fluid element comes in proximity to the aircraft, free-stream conditions are lost, its velocity changes and pressure gradients develop. The pressure exerted on the element, therefore, will not be, in general, equal to the static pressure anymore.<br/><br/>Static pressure and the Bernoulli equation<br/><br/>The Bernoulli equation, assuming incompressible, inviscid flow and negligible gravitational effects, can be written as follows:<br/><br/>Since the term ρv2 / 2 is, by definition, the so-called dynamic pressure, the term p, by contrast, is usually named static pressure although it may, or may not, refer to the above mentioned free-stream pressure. The two possible cases are:<br/><br/>Bernoulli equation referred to free-stream conditions – When the Bernoulli equation is applied to a point of the flow field far upstream of any object, both pressure and velocity take their respective free-stream values and , therefore the Bernoulli equation can be correctly read as "the sum of static pressure and (free-stream) dynamic pressure is constant across the flow field".<br/><br/>Bernoulli equation referred to a generic point – When the Bernoulli equation is written for a generic point A of the flow field, for example a point close to an airfoil, the value of the fluid pressure pA is in general different from the free-stream one, and, strictly speaking, the term should not be referred to as static pressure. The Bernoulli equation could be correctly read, for example, as "the sum of fluid pressure in A and dynamic pressure in A is constant across the flow field". Nevertheless it is very common to refer to the non-velocity-dependent term of the Bernoulli equation as static pressure anyway, regardless of whether it is applied to free-stream conditions or not.<br/><br/>The two cases can be summarized by applying the Bernoulli equation to different points of the flow field: a point far upstream, a generic point close to a body and, for completeness, a stagnation point on the body's surface:<br/><br/>where:<br/><br/>= free-stream (static) pressure<br/><br/>ρ = fluid density (assumed constant)<br/><br/>= free-stream velocity<br/><br/>p = fluid pressure in a generic point<br/><br/>v = velocity in a generic point<br/><br/>pS = stagnation (or total) pressure<br/><br/>See also<br/><br/>References<br/><br/>^ There are only a few areas (e.g. some parts of the fuselage or along the outside of a Pitot tube) where the pressure exerted is equal to the static pressure; those are the places where static ports are located.<br/><br/>^ A pressure gradient would in fact cause an acceleration, and so the velocity would not be constant anymore. Note also that we are neglecting the variation of atmospheric pressure with altitude. | _Sadržaj<br/><br/>- Statički pritisak u dinamici fluida<br/><br/>- Upotreba izraza statički tlak u dinamici fluida je vrlo česta, iako može dovesti do dvosmislenosti. - Dvosmislenost proizlazi iz činjenice da se statički pritisak može koristiti, ispravno, da se odnosi na pritisak slobodnog toka u vanjskim tokovima, ali to je češće, i ne uvijek ispravno, koristi se za upućivanje na pritisak u generičkoj točki protočnog polja, tipično prilikom rasprave o jednadžbi Bernoullija. da bi se izbjegla dvosmislenost, alternativni izrazi koji bi se mogli koristiti, ovisno o kontekstu, su pritisak slobodnog toka, tlak tekućine, termodinamički tlak ili često samo tlak.<br/><br/>Ekvivalentnost statičkog i slobodnog toka pritiska<br/><br/>Promatrač koji stoji na tlu vidio bi generički fluidni element koji se ne miče i podložan lokalnom statičkom tlaku (koji je u ovom slučaju atmosferski tlak).<br/>Mi sada smatramo avion koji leti ravno i ravno brzinom (brzina zraka i brzina tla su isti, u ovom primjeru), približavajući se istom fluidnom elementu s velike udaljenosti. - Razdaljina je takva da element fluida nije uznemiren približavanjem aviona. - Promatraču na zrakoplovu, element fluida, kao i svi elementi fluida na istoj udaljenosti, pojavljuje se kao i u uvjetima slobodnog toka, gdje svi fluidni elementi teku ravno prema zrakoplovu s istom konstantnom brzinom i nema gradijenta tlaka unutar tekućine (to jest tlak je konstantan bilo gdje u toj regiji fluida).[4] S obzirom da je element fluida isti za oba promatrača, tako da je pritisak na koji je element podložan, dakle ono što promatrač u mirovanju naziva statičkim tlakom zapravo je pritisak slobodnog toka prema promatraču koji se relativno kreće prema fluidu. Ovo je jedini slučaj u dinamici fluida gdje se, strogo govoreći, izraz statički tlak može koristiti na odgovarajući način[potreban citat], tj. odnositi se na pritisak slobodnog toka.<br/>- Imajte na umu da kada element fluida dođe u blizini aviona, gubi se uslov slobodnog toka, razvijaju se njegove promjene brzine i gradijenti pritiska. - Pritisak koji se vrši na element, dakle, neće biti, općenito, više jednak statičkom pritisku.<br/><br/>- Statički pritisak i Bernoullijeva jednadžba<br/><br/>Bernoullijeva jednadžba, pretpostavljajući nedodirljiv, neviđen protok i zanemarive gravitacijske efekte, može se napisati kako slijedi:<br/><br/>S obzirom da je pojam νv2 / 2, po definiciji, tzv. dinamički tlak, pojam p se, suprotno tome, obično naziva statičkim tlakom iako se može, ili ne može, odnositi na gore navedeni pritisak slobodnog toka.<br/><br/>Bernoullijeva jednadžba odnosi se na uvjete slobodnog toka. Kada se jednadžba Bernoullijeva primjenjuje na točku toka polja daleko uzvodno od bilo kojeg objekta, i tlak i brzina uzimaju svoje vrijednosti slobodnog toka i , dakle Bernoullijeva jednadžba se može ispravno čitati kao zbroj statičkog tlaka i (slobodno-streamski) dinamički tlak je konstantan preko protočnog polja.<br/><br/>Bernoullijeva jednadžba odnosi se na generičku točku. Kada je Bernoullijeva jednadžba napisana za generičku točku A toka polja protoka, na primjer tačka u neposrednoj blizini zračne folije, vrijednost tlaka fluida PA općenito se razlikuje od one slobodnog toka, i, strogo govoreći, pojam se ne bi trebao nazivati statičkim tlakom. Bernoullijeva jednadžba može se ispravno pročitati, na primjer, kao što je zbroj tlaka tekućine u A i dinamičkog tlaka u A konstantno preko polja protoka - Usprkos tome vrlo je uobičajeno da se pojam Bernoullijeva jednadžba neovisna o brzini naziva statičkim pritiskom svejedno, bez obzira na to primjenjuje li se na uvjete slobodnog toka ili ne.<br/><br/>- Dva slučaja mogu se sažeti primjenom Bernoullijeve jednadžbe na različite tačke toka polja: tačka daleko uzvodno, generička tačka blizu nekog tela i, za potpunu, tačka stagnacije na površini tela:<br/><br/>- gdje:<br/><br/>= slobodni tok (statički) tlak<br/><br/>ν = gustoća tekućine (pretpostavljena konstanta)<br/><br/>= free-stream brzina<br/><br/>P = tlak tekućine u generičkoj točki<br/><br/>v = brzina u generičkoj točki<br/><br/>- pS = stagnacija (ili ukupni) tlak<br/><br/>\"Vidi i ti\"<br/><br/>Reference<br/><br/>^ Postoji samo nekoliko područja (npr. neki dijelovi trupa ili duž vanjske strane pitotske cijevi) gdje je tlak jednak statičkom tlaku; to su mjesta gdje se nalaze statički portovi.<br/><br/>^ Gradijent pritiska bi u stvari izazvao ubrzanje, i tako brzina više ne bi bila konstantna. |
