| Forty-nine years ago today, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act of 1965.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Nearly a century ago, the 15th Amendment to the Constitution stated, "The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of race, color or previous condition of servitude." And nearly a century before that, our nation's founding fathers set in motion the great experiment of American democracy by declaring that "all men are created equal."<br/><br/>The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was a belated acknowledgment that even in America, our foundational ideals carry little weight if not protected by the rule of law. That's why Section 2 of the 15th Amendment granted Congress the "power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation."<br/><br/>And indeed, the codified language of the Voting Rights Act was able to achieve what the Reconstruction-era Congress and Thomas Jefferson could not. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act—and the civil rights movement from which they emerged—served as the catalyst for a dramatic increase in the opportunity for black Americans to participate in the democratic process.<br/><br/>For example, only 6.7 percent of eligible black Mississippians were registered to vote as of 1962; by 1969 that figure had reached 66.5 percent. Today, Mississippi has more black elected officials than any other state.<br/><br/>The protections put in place by the Voting Rights Act were long overdue when they were passed, representative of the arduous struggle with which they were achieved. But unthinkably, these protections are now under assault, jeopardizing the progress our nation worked so hard to achieve.<br/><br/>Last year, in the case of Shelby County v. Holder, the U.S. Supreme Court gutted a key component of the Voting Rights Act that enabled prior federal review to ensure nondiscrimination before any new voting law went into effect.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Sadly, the response of Republican leaders has been to do nothing. Sen. Ted Cruz and Gov. Rick Perry went out of their way to praise the Supreme Court's decision. Sen. Rand Paul dismissed the continued necessity of the Voting Rights Act by noting, "We have an African-American president."<br/><br/>While the election of President Barack Obama was indeed a historic milestone, it is dangerous to think that it absolves us from remaining vigilant against the lingering consequences of our nation's past. The haste with which states have moved to enact voting restrictions is confirmation that the protections put in place by Section 4 are still necessary.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Republican governors have signed strict photo-identification restrictions into law as the solution to a virtually nonexistent problem of voter impersonation, disproportionately hurting women, young people, working families and the African-American community. It's disingenuous for Republicans like Paul to seek the votes of these communities when they believe "there's nothing wrong with" putting restrictions in place that make it harder for these constituencies to vote.<br/><br/>Republicans have also sought to restrict early-voting periods, including the Sunday before Election Day, when African-American churches have had great success with Souls to the Polls programs.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>These restrictions represent a callous effort by Republicans to make voting harder, based on narrow, short-term political calculations that Republicans can win elections by shrinking the size of the electorate.<br/><br/>Democrats have a very different mission when it comes to voting: to ensure that every eligible voter can register, that every registered voter can vote and that every vote is accurately counted.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>The Democratic National Committee's Voter Expansion Project reflects our belief that greater voter participation strengthens our nation and our democracy. We'll continue to use our unmatched institutional knowledge to protect voting rights against legislation and tactics that would attempt to suppress the vote. And because the best defense is a good offense, we're also working to expand the vote by deploying our technology and data resources to register new voters.<br/><br/>On this anniversary, one of the best ways we can honor those who struggled—and in some cases gave their very lives—for the legislation's passage is for Republicans in Congress to join Democrats in passing the Voting Rights Amendment Act to restore the promise of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Democrat, represents Florida's 23rd Congressional District in the United States Congress. Since 2011, she has served as chair of the Democratic National Committee. Follow her on Twitter.<br/><br/>The Root aims to foster and advance conversations about issues relevant to the black Diaspora by presenting a variety of opinions from all perspectives, whether or not those opinions are shared by our editorial staff. | - Prije 49 godina danas, predsjednik Lyndon B. Johnson potpisao Zakon o pravima glasanja 1965.<br/><br/>) Oglas<br/><br/>Pre skoro jednog veka, 15. amandman na Ustav je izneo, pravo građana Sjedinjenih Država da glasaju ne može biti odbijeno ili skraćeno od strane Sjedinjenih Država ili bilo koje države zbog rase, boje ili prethodnog stanja služenja. I skoro stoljeće prije toga, naši narodni oci osnivači pokrenuli su veliki eksperiment američke demokracije izjavom da su svi ljudi stvoreni jednaki.<br/><br/>- Zakon o pravima glasanja iz 1965. bio je zakašnjelo priznanje da čak i u Americi, naši temeljni ideali nose malo težine ako ne i zaštićeni vladavinom prava. Zato je odjeljak 2 15. amandmana Kongresu dodijelio snagu da provodi ovaj članak odgovarajućim zakonodavstvom.<br/><br/>I zaista, kodificirani jezik Zakona o pravima glasanja bio je u stanju postići ono što Kongres iz doba obnove i Thomas Jefferson nisu mogli. Zakon o građanskim pravima iz 1964. i Zakon o pravima glasanja - i pokret za građanska prava iz kojeg su se pojavili - služili su kao katalizator dramatičnog povećanja mogućnosti da crni Amerikanci učestvuju u demokratskom procesu.<br/><br/>Na primjer, samo 6,7 posto podobnih crnih Mississippianaca registrirano je da glasaju od 1962. godine; do 1969. ta je cifra dostigla 66,5 posto. danas Mississippi ima više crnih izabranih dužnosnika od bilo koje druge države.<br/><br/>- Zaštita uspostavljena Zakonom o pravima glasanja odavno je kasnila kada su usvojena, predstavnica teške borbe s kojom su postignuta.

| Q&A: Vatican safeguarding expert Fr Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>13 June 2021<br/><br/>Fr Hans Zollner SJ. Image: Australian Jesuits.<br/><br/>The President of the Centre for Child Protection at the Gregorian University in Rome, and a member of the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors, Fr Hans Zollner SJ, was in Australia in 2018 to speak to Catholic ministry leaders and survivors.<br/><br/>Michael McVeigh from Jesuit Communications sat down with him during the visit to explore how the Church is responding to the abuse crisis internationally, and what can be learned from our experiences in Australia.<br/><br/>MM: This is your third trip to Australia. You've visited quite a few other countries to see how the Church is responding to abuse around the world. Can you give us some idea of what the global picture looks like?<br/><br/>Fr Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>HZ: My understanding, after having visited about 50 countries on five or six continents, is that the Church is really starting to move over the last couple of years on the issue of doing justice to victims, of listening to them, and doing whatever can be done in terms of safeguarding.<br/><br/>I was with the Jesuit Provincials from all over Africa at the end of April, and the President of the Jesuit Assistancy of Africa and Madagascar is very much committed and dedicated to this. He has put up a thorough action plan for formation and for introducing guidelines all over the place. It's a very considerate and very deliberate effort to do whatever can be done to be proactively engaged as Jesuits in Africa — in a continent where until a few years ago all of this was a foreign language.<br/><br/>One of the challenges of trying to develop this global approach is that you're dealing with so many cultures, and so many different understandings. How do you bring this together and try to provide training and support religious communities tackling these issues?<br/><br/>This is one of the major questions we have. I think what I can do is stimulate discussion, stimulate reflection, and prepare people as much as possible so that they can do the groundwork.<br/><br/>The Centre for Child Protection at the Gregorian University does not pretend to have the response to every question. Not only because we don't know the specific contexts — we might know a few of them, but we're talking about thousands of cultures, we're talking about hundreds of languages, we're talking about very diverse legal backgrounds. It varies even sometimes within one country, such as Australia where you have states within the Commonwealth of Australia that have different laws than other states.<br/><br/>I am somebody who tries to elicit and stimulate discussion and reflection. I'm also very happy to listen to people.<br/><br/>You mentioned the need to listen and support victims in being heard. We've obviously had the Royal Commission here in Australia, but what are some of the other ways that you've seen that the voices of victims are being supported around the world?<br/><br/>In France there is one diocese that has established what they call 'The Listening Space'. There, victims can come forward and they can express themselves. The bishop is present. It's an open space in which people who have been hurt tremendously are free at least to express what they want to ask from the Church leadership etc.<br/><br/>There are other places in the USA or in other countries where victims have been invited by dioceses, by Provinces, by the leadership of the Church, to come forward. I have to say that overall I think there is a good will, and there are more people like bishops and provincials who listen to victims than we know. But there is no one model of giving victims not only the space to express themselves and be listened to, but also to engage actively in Church development.<br/><br/>In terms of setting up spaces for support for victims, what are some of the things you've seen that could really help — and that we could be considering here in Australia?<br/><br/>One of the major points that many victims bring up is, 'Can't we have, within parish settings, within schools settings, a regular conversation going on that includes survivors of abuse as regular members of a committee, a commission, a sounding board, a feedback group or something like that?' So that this voice is not only brought in on a specific occasion, or where a person feels like he or she is at a point to be able to speak out about it, but [is heard] on a regular basis — build that voice into the system.<br/><br/>That will help all of us. It will help survivors and victims because they will feel welcome and appreciated in the specific experience, and in the specific life challenges, that they went through. Secondly it will help the community at large, because we can at least make ourselves more and more sensitive to what the concerns and specific needs of survivors are — that can also talk to the needs of young people.<br/><br/>M: We have strong groups of survivors here in Australia who have been able to support each other through that process. But what you're saying is that we need some way of supporting those groups, and supporting those people, through our own institutions as well?<br/><br/>And I think we need to be creative. It will work for one school and one parish and one diocese in one way, and for others in a different way. Because the survivors with whom I am in constant contact, they have quite similar requests, and similar experiences in regard to being welcomed in the Church or not — feeling thrown out or dismissed. But they have also among themselves quite different expectations. So I have learned that you have also to be very forthcoming in accepting the differences in what this specific group, or this specific survivor, wants, requests and needs.<br/><br/>M: Survivors talk about wanting to have their stories heard and acknowledged. We've had the Royal Commission here in Australia, which provided an independent process where victims could come forward. Is there a need for something like that in terms of a truth, justice and reconciliation process for the Church internationally?<br/><br/>H: Yes, I think there is a need for that internationally. But I think first every local church needs to do its own homework. I don't see it happening very soon that some such council or commission would be established to look into this area for the whole Church. The Church has a membership of 1.3 billion people, and is present in 190 countries, with all kinds of differences in expectations concerning psychological, spiritual and financial support.<br/><br/>There is one thing that I have come across consistently in communicating with, working with and listening to victims, and that is that they want to be listened to. So if there was the feeling that victims were constantly being listened to — in Rome and elsewhere — I think that would give a great relief to many victims.<br/><br/>I think [Pope Francis'] concern, especially with regard to your question, is that the local churches do whatever they can so that victims will be listened to in that particular country. I have a list of people who want to speak to the Holy Father directly, and physically it is impossible. I was there in 2014 to translate for two German survivors who were chosen with two Irish and two English survivors when he received the six of them at home. He took the whole morning listening to them one after the other. For each one, he was there for 40 to 45 minutes. Were he to do this for every survivor he couldn't sleep anymore.<br/><br/>His example is modelling for the whole Catholic Church the way victims and survivors are received, welcomed and listened to. I think if the bishops and the provincials in this world, in all countries, followed his example, many survivors would be really appreciative of that.<br/><br/>Archbishop Diarmud Martin was recently quoted just before the World Meeting of Families, about the Pontifical Commission, saying that it's too small as it's currently set up to achieve what it needs to achieve. What's your take on that? Does the Church need to be putting more resources into how it's overseeing those issues?<br/><br/>At the moment we are 16 members from basically all continents, and the major language groups. We represent a variety of disciplines and professions, and the purpose of the commission — as the statutes that have just been promulgated state — is to provide counsel to the Holy Father.<br/><br/>A common misunderstanding about the commission is first that we deal with cases of allegations. That is not the case. We have no juridical or administrative power in regards to cases, because when it comes to allegations of abuse the tribunals and procedure are set.<br/><br/>A second misunderstanding is that we promote, directly, things on the ground. Our first and foremost goal is that we advise the Holy Father on issues.<br/><br/>So from my point of view, yes, we need to invest more. But we need to invest more on the local level, and we need to make sure that the proposals from the Pontifical Commission are forwarded to the Holy Father — which normally the President does — and then there is a follow-up process that reflects what we have given as our advice.<br/><br/>In Australia, Catholic Professional Standards Limited is overseeing the Church's response and providing guidelines and support for ensuring all the institutions in the Church are child-safe institutions. Is there a need for some kind of organisational support from Rome for those bishops and dioceses that are struggling to form these institutions and provide safeguarding in those dioceses?<br/><br/>I think ultimately the commission will develop in that line. They are now in the process of hiring experts in those areas.<br/><br/>I think the Church needs to understand that the local churches can learn from each other mutually. And my understanding has always been — and I think the Holy Father has reminded us — that the Church will not function as a centralised company. It does not work like that, effectively. Every bishop, every bishops conference, has, to some extent, its life on its own. What we need to learn more is to open channels of mutual communication.<br/><br/>There are a number of things that people blame for abuse in the Church. As a priest and a psychologist, and as someone who has met and worked with survivors, what are your thoughts on that issue?<br/><br/>I think the question of where does abuse come from is the most important one, and the Pope has addressed that in his letter to the people of God published on 20 August. He says in the first paragraph, and repeats it over and over again, that the question of sexual abuse is always linked — or almost always linked — not only to the question of abuse of power, but also to the abuse of conscience.<br/><br/>So the real fundamental question of abuse is much more complex than just [the question of] sexuality — be it heterosexual or homosexual. It's a power issue, and there we have to really work on the question of how do we understand priesthood, how to we understand bishophood, how do we understand and live out our ministries? What are the boundaries?<br/><br/>That's why I'm very happy that the Jesuit Province in Australia is establishing a Code of Conduct. Because we don't talk only about sexual abuse of minors. We talk about sexual abuse of adults, and we talk about abuse in other ways — like abuse of conscience, where you dictate to someone what you think, or you pretend to know by God, and you can tell another person, 'You need to do that', against the conscience of that person.<br/><br/>Many people think celibacy produces abuse. As I always say, celibacy as such is not cause for abusing — otherwise how do we explain that 99.9 per cent of all abusers do not live a celibate life, and how do we explain that 95 or 96 per cent of all priests do not abuse minors? But, celibacy, or a vow of chastity, that is not really integrated, that is not really lived out properly — yes, that produces a problem. Sometimes people take to drinking, sometime they take to gambling, and sometimes they take to sexual misconduct, with adults and with minors.<br/><br/>The real question about this is how do we deal with the notion of religious spiritual power with which priests and bishops are invested? How can theology help us to understand, and maybe how can sociology, psychology, or business administration help us to define the limits of power, and the necessity of keeping your boundaries | Q&A: Vatikanski stručnjak za zaštitu Fr Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>? 13. lipnja 2021.<br/><br/>Fr Hans Zollner SJ. Image: Australski isusovci.<br/><br/>Predsjednik Centra za zaštitu djece na Gregorijanskom sveučilištu u Rimu, te član Papinske komisije za zaštitu maloljetnika, fra Hans Zollner SJ, bio je 2018. godine u Australiji kako bi razgovarao s čelnicima katoličkog ministarstva i preživjelima.<br/><br/>Michael McVeigh iz isusovačkih komunikacija sjeo je s njim tijekom posjeta kako bi istražio kako Crkva reagira na krizu zlostavljanja na međunarodnoj razini, i što se može naučiti iz naših iskustava u Australiji.<br/><br/>MM: Ovo je vaše treće putovanje u Australiju, posjetili ste još nekoliko zemalja da vidite kako Crkva reagira na zloupotrebu diljem svijeta.<br/><br/>Fr Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>HZ: Nakon što sam posjetio oko 50 zemalja na pet ili šest kontinenata, Crkva se počinje kretati u posljednjih nekoliko godina zbog pitanja pravde žrtvama, slušanja njih i svega što se može učiniti u smislu zaštite.<br/><br/>Bio sam s isusovačkim provincijalima iz cijele Afrike krajem travnja, a predsjednik isusovačke asistencije Afrike i Madagaskara je vrlo posvećen i posvećen tome. On je postavio temeljiti akcijski plan za formiranje i uvođenje smjernica posvuda. To je vrlo obziran i vrlo promišljen pokušaj da se učini sve što se može učiniti da se proaktivno angažiraju kao isusovci u Africi — na kontinentu gdje je do prije nekoliko godina sve ovo bio strani jezik.<br/><br/>Jedan od izazova za razvoj ovog globalnog pristupa je da imate posla sa toliko mnogo kultura, i toliko različitih shvatanja. Kako to spojite i pokušate pružiti obuku i podršku vjerskim zajednicama u rješavanju tih pitanja?<br/><br/>Mislim da mogu potaknuti diskusiju, stimulirati razmišljanje i pripremiti ljude koliko god je to moguće kako bi mogli raditi temelje.<br/><br/>- Centar za zaštitu djece na gregorijanskom sveučilištu ne pretvara se da ima odgovor na svako pitanje. Ne samo zato što ne znamo specifične kontekste — možda znamo neke od njih, već govorimo o tisućama kultura, govorimo o stotinama jezika, govorimo o vrlo raznolikim pravnim pozadinama. - Ona varira čak i ponekad unutar jedne zemlje, kao što je Australija gdje imate države unutar Commonwealtha Australije koje imaju različite zakone od drugih država.<br/><br/>Ja sam neko ko pokušava da izazove i stimuliše diskusiju i razmišljanje.<br/><br/>Očito imamo Kraljevsku komisiju ovdje u Australiji, ali koji su drugi načini na koje ste vidjeli da se glasovi žrtava podupiru diljem svijeta?<br/><br/>U Francuskoj postoji jedna biskupija koja je uspostavila ono što zovu \"Svemir slušanja\", a tamo žrtve mogu istupiti i izraziti se. To je otvoreni prostor u kojem su ljudi koji su strahovito povrijeđeni slobodni izraziti barem ono što žele tražiti od crkvenog vodstva itd.<br/><br/>- Postoje i druga mjesta u SAD-u ili u drugim zemljama gdje su žrtve pozvane od strane biskupija, od strane provincija, od strane vodstva Crkve, da istupe. Moram reći da sve u svemu mislim da postoji dobra volja, i ima više ljudi kao što su biskupi i provincijalci koji slušaju žrtve nego što znamo. - Ali nema modela davanja žrtvama ne samo prostora za izražavanje i slušanje, nego i aktivno uključivanje u razvoj Crkve.<br/><br/>- U smislu postavljanja prostora za podršku žrtvama, koje su neke od stvari koje ste vidjeli koje bi stvarno mogle pomoći — i koje bismo mogli razmatrati ovdje u Australiji?<br/><br/>- Jedna od glavnih stvari koje mnoge žrtve spominju je: 'Zar ne možemo, unutar parohije, unutar školskih postavki, imati redovit razgovor koji uključuje preživjele zlostavljanja kao redovite članove odbora, komisije, zvučne ploče, povratne informacije grupe ili tako nešto?' Tako da se taj glas ne dovodi samo u određenoj prilici, ili gdje se osoba osjeća kao da je u trenutku da može govoriti o tome, nego se i redovito čuje — ugrađuje taj glas u sustav.<br/><br/>To će pomoći preživjelima i žrtvama jer će se osjećati dobrodošlima i cijenjenima u specifičnom iskustvu, i u specifičnim životnim izazovima, kroz koje su prošli. - Drugo, pomoći će zajednici na slobodi, jer se barem možemo učiniti sve osjetljivijima na ono što su zabrinutosti i specifične potrebe preživjelih — koje također mogu razgovarati s potrebama mladih ljudi.<br/><br/>M: Imamo jake grupe preživjelih ovdje u Australiji koji su bili u mogućnosti podržati jedni druge kroz taj proces. - Ali ono što želite reći je da nam treba neki način podrške tim grupama, i podržavanja tih ljudi, kroz naše institucije, kao i?<br/><br/>Radit će za jednu školu i jednu župu i jednu biskupiju na jedan način, a za druge na drugi način. Preživjeli s kojima sam u stalnom kontaktu imaju slične zahtjeve i slična iskustva u pogledu dobrodošlice u Crkvi ili ne — osjećaju se izbačenima ili odbačenima. Naučio sam da i vi morate biti vrlo predusretljivi u prihvaćanju razlika u tome što ta specifična grupa, ili ova specifična preživjela, želi, traži i treba.<br/><br/>M: Preživjeli govore o tome da žele da se njihove priče čuju i priznaju, a mi smo imali Kraljevsku komisiju ovdje u Australiji, koja je omogućila neovisan proces gdje bi žrtve mogle istupiti. Postoji li potreba za nečim takvim u smislu procesa istine, pravde i pomirenja za Crkvu na međunarodnom nivou?<br/><br/>H: Da, mislim da postoji potreba za tom međunarodnom potrebom, ali mislim da prvo svaka lokalna crkva mora sama da uradi svoju domaću zadaću. Ne vidim da će se uskoro dogoditi da neko takvo vijeće ili komisija budu uspostavljeni kako bi istražili ovo područje za cijelu Crkvu. Crkva ima članstvo od 1,3 milijarde ljudi, a prisutna je u 190 zemalja, sa raznim razlikama u očekivanjima u vezi sa psihološkom, duhovnom i financijskom potporom.<br/><br/>- Postoji jedna stvar na koju sam naišao dosljedno u komunikaciji, radu sa žrtvama i slušanju žrtava, a to je da žele da ih se sluša. Dakle, ako postoji osjećaj da se žrtve stalno slušaju — u Rimu i drugdje — mislim da bi to pružilo veliko olakšanje mnogim žrtvama.<br/><br/>Mislim da [Pope Francis] brine, posebno u vezi s vašim pitanjem, da lokalne crkve rade sve što mogu kako bi žrtve bile saslušane u toj zemlji. Imam spisak ljudi koji žele direktno da razgovaraju sa Svetim Ocem, i fizički je to nemoguće. Bio sam tamo 2014. da prevedem za dvoje preživjelih Nijemaca koji su izabrani sa dva irska i dva engleska preživjela kad ih je primio šestoricu kod kuće. Bio je tamo 40 do 45 minuta, da to radi za svakog preživjelog koga više ne može spavati.<br/><br/>- Njegov primjer je modeliranje za cijelu Katoličku crkvu način na koji se žrtve i preživjeli primaju, dočekuju i slušaju. Mislim da ako bi biskupi i provincijalci u ovom svijetu, u svim zemljama, slijedili njegov primjer, mnogi preživjeli bi bili zaista zahvalni za to.<br/><br/>Nadbiskup Diarmud Martin nedavno je citiran prije Svjetskog sastanka obitelji, o Papinskoj komisiji, rekavši da je premalen jer je trenutno postavljen da postigne ono što treba postići. Da li Crkva treba da ulaže više resursa u nadgledanje tih problema?<br/><br/>- Trenutno smo 16 članova sa svih kontinenata, i glavnih jezičkih grupa. Zastupamo razne discipline i profesije, a svrha komisije — kao statuta koji su upravo proglašeni državom — je pružanje savjeta Svetom Ocu.<br/><br/>Učestalo nerazumijevanje u vezi komisije je prvo da se bavimo slučajevima navoda. - Nemamo sudsku ili administrativnu moć u vezi sa slučajevima, jer kada se radi o navodima o zloupotrebi, sud i postupak su postavljeni.<br/><br/>Drugi nesporazum je da direktno promoviramo stvari na terenu, a naš prvi i najvažniji cilj je da savjetujemo Svetog Oca o pitanjima.<br/><br/>- Dakle, s moje točke gledišta, da, moramo ulagati više. Moramo više ulagati na lokalnoj razini i moramo se pobrinuti da se prijedlozi Papinske komisije proslijede Svetom Ocu — što inače predsjednik radi — a zatim slijedi postupak koji odražava ono što smo dali kao naš savjet.<br/><br/>U Australiji katolički profesionalni standardi Limited nadgledaju odgovor Crkve i pružaju smjernice i podršku za osiguranje svih institucija u Crkvi su institucije za zaštitu djece. Postoji li potreba za nekakvom organizacijskom podrškom Rima za biskupima i biskupijama koji se bore da osnuju te institucije i osiguraju zaštitu u tim biskupijama?<br/><br/>Oni su sada u procesu zapošljavanja stručnjaka u tim područjima.<br/><br/>Mislim da Crkva treba shvatiti da lokalne crkve mogu međusobno učiti jedna od druge, a moje razumijevanje je uvijek bilo, i mislim da nas je Sveti Otac podsjetio, da Crkva neće funkcionirati kao centralizirana tvrtka. Svaki biskup, svaka biskupska konferencija, ima, u određenoj mjeri, svoj život na svoju ruku, ono što trebamo naučiti više je otvoriti kanale međusobne komunikacije.<br/><br/>Kao svećenik i psiholog, i kao netko tko je upoznao i radio s preživjelima, što mislite o tom pitanju?<br/><br/>Mislim da je najvažnije pitanje odakle dolazi zloupotreba, a Papa je to uputio u svom pismu Božjem narodu objavljenom 20. kolovoza. On kaže u prvom paragrafu, i ponavlja ga iznova i iznova, da je pitanje seksualnog zlostavljanja uvijek povezano - ili gotovo uvijek povezano - ne samo sa pitanjem zloupotrebe vlasti, nego i sa zloupotrebom savjesti.<br/><br/>Dakle, pravo fundamentalno pitanje zlostavljanja je mnogo složenije od [pitanja] seksualnosti — bilo da je heteroseksualno ili homoseksualno. To je pitanje moći, i tamo moramo stvarno da radimo na pitanju kako da razumemo sveštenstvo, kako da razumemo biskupiju, kako da razumemo i oživimo naša ministarstva?<br/><br/>Zato sam jako sretan što isusovačka provincija u Australiji uspostavlja Kodeks ponašanja jer ne govorimo samo o seksualnom zlostavljanju maloljetnika. Govorimo o seksualnom zlostavljanju odraslih, i govorimo o zlostavljanju na druge načine — kao što je zlostavljanje savjesti, gdje nekome diktirate što mislite, ili se pretvarate da znate po Bogu, i možete reći drugoj osobi: \"Trebate to učiniti\", protiv savjesti te osobe.<br/><br/>Mnogi misle da celibat izaziva zloupotrebu. Kao što uvijek kažem, celibat kao takav nije razlog za zloupotrebu — inače kako objašnjavamo da 99,9 posto svih zlostavljača ne živi celibatski život, i kako objašnjavamo da 95 ili 96 posto svih svećenika ne zlostavlja maloljetnike? Ali, celibat, ili zavjet čednosti, koji zapravo nije integriran, koji zapravo nije proživljen kako treba — da, to stvara problem. Ponekad se ljudi opijaju, nekad se kockaju, a ponekad se upuštaju u seksualno nedolično ponašanje, sa odraslima i sa maloletnicima.<br/><br/>Pravo pitanje o tome je kako se nositi s pojmom vjerske duhovne moći s kojom se ulažu svećenici i biskupi? Kako nam teologija može pomoći da razumijemo, i možda kako nam sociologija, psihologija ili poslovna administracija mogu pomoći da definiramo granice moći, i nužnost držanja vaših granica |
| I'm not surprised by this mismatch. In fact, I'd even go so far as to say this isn't something that will ever change, nor should we get all steamed up about changing it. In 10 years, we'll still have bleeding edge, complex items in the biggest concerns list, and the things we're finally getting around to understanding will be the major parts of our spending.<br/><br/>Now, Gunnar and Andy both have excellent points, specifically about IT teams seeing IT problems and solving them with IT solutions; in fact, I'm positive their points hold merit.<br/><br/>But I think there are other ideas that trump those (I did comment on their blogs about it, and later decided I should just blog here). Those top 3 concerns are bleedingly new such that:<br/><br/>we fear new things because we don't understand them, or don't understand them because they're new.<br/><br/>they're too new for us to have solid approaches to handling them.<br/><br/>they're too new for us to know if we should be worried or not! we tend to default to paranoid/worried, which is good!<br/><br/>too new to have obvious budget items assigned to them. Can I buy a box or some software that provide "cloud security" or "social media security?"<br/><br/>they're so new the business doesn't even know how to use them or what they want out of them. Let alone how we can secure them while still meeting or at least not stomping all over business needs. If the business doesn't even know how to use them yet, I'm not sure security is in any position to guide that usage securely.<br/><br/>It also should be mentioned that these new things are being largely pushed via consumerland and into the business, with IT as a sort of, "Oh yeah," thought. Firewalls, AV, AM, Auth are all IT responses to typically IT issues. Of course there is a difference there. They're also very subjective issues, as opposed to very objective items like firewalls, known malicious bits, behaviors, signatures, ports. Business presents very complex issues that are often involving people (which we can't patch) and that often don't fit nicely into blanket rules. Even if we turned away from technical solutions and devoted our time into solving these problems, they are still not going to be neatly solved. Likewise, when push comes to shove, can you have and meet goals with firewalls? Can you show improvement? All of this flows from the rather subjective non-technical aspect of those issues. Sort of the difference between a child's report card and the feedback you get from a parent-teacher conference. If you have a child, which one would you be most inclined to disagree with or not necessarily believe? (The answer is the subjective one!)<br/><br/>It could be said this is the natural progression of security and technology: from shoring up the technical controls to moving up the stack towards behavior and people. Sure, these 3 top concerns can be said to punch through firewalls and network segments, but that's the nature of those things (social media "punching" through a firewall is far different than me punching through an SSH connection to bridge my home network; social media is akin to the *way* I use my SSH connection after the hold is already punched because it is needed; i.e. social media is the way port 80 is used.)<br/><br/>Basically, all indications point to not being surprised by this dichotomy. And I don't think this is some further indication that IT/security is doing it wrong, or isn't aligned properly with business, or has a technical dark-server-room background. I'm not saying we're doing things right or we're properly aligned, but the above isn't a good argument to support the theory of those deficiencies.<br/><br/>Now for a really big jump. I'd liken the current increase in mobile computing to be as big as the introduction of computers into the business and later the PC/internet into business. Now, I wasn't around when the former happened, nor was I in the industry when the personal computer revolution swept into business, but I would bet that is the closest comparison so far. I may even say the same for social media. These are damned new and they're big changes beyond just bringing in Macs or new software or some new business process. | U stvari, čak bih otišao toliko daleko da kažem da ovo nije nešto što će se ikada promeniti, niti bi trebalo da se unervozimo oko toga da ga promenimo. Za 10 godina, još uvijek ćemo imati krvavi rub, složene predmete na listi najvećih briga, a stvari koje konačno razumijemo bit će glavni dijelovi naše potrošnje.<br/><br/>Gunnar i Andy imaju odlične bodove, posebno o IT timovima koji vide IT probleme i rješavaju ih informatičkim rješenjima; zapravo, siguran sam da njihovi bodovi imaju vrijednost.<br/><br/>Mislim da postoje i druge ideje koje ih nadmašuju (komentirao sam na njihovim blogovima o tome, a kasnije sam odlučio da bih trebao blogirati ovdje).<br/><br/>Bojimo se novih stvari jer ih ne razumijemo, ili ih ne razumijemo jer su nove.<br/><br/>- oni su previše novi za nas imati čvrste pristupe za rukovanje njima.<br/><br/>Oni su previše novi za nas da znamo da li treba da se brinemo ili ne!<br/><br/>Mogu li kupiti kutiju ili neki softver koji pruža sigurnost oblaka ili socijalnu medijsku sigurnost?<br/><br/>-A kamoli kako ih možemo osigurati dok se još sastaju ili barem ne gaze po poslovnim potrebama. Ako posao još ne zna kako da ih koristi, nisam siguran da je osiguranje u poziciji da sigurno vodi tu upotrebu.<br/><br/>Treba spomenuti i da se te nove stvari uglavnom guraju preko potrošačke zemlje i u posao, s informatikom kao svojevrsnim, -Oh yeah - misao. Vatrozidovi, AV, AM, Auth su svi IT odgovori na tipična IT pitanja. Oni su također vrlo subjektivna pitanja, za razliku od vrlo objektivnih predmeta poput firewalla, poznatih zlonamjernih bitova, ponašanja, potpisa, luka. - Posao predstavlja vrlo složena pitanja koja često uključuju ljude (koje ne možemo zakrpati) i koja se često ne uklapaju lijepo u pravila pokrivača. Ako se i okrenemo od tehničkih rješenja i posvetimo svoje vrijeme rješavanju tih problema, oni i dalje neće biti uredno riješeni. Sve to teče iz subjektivnog netehničkog aspekta tih pitanja. - Ako imate dijete, s kojim biste se najviše složili ili ne nužno vjerovali? (Odgovor je subjektivan!)<br/><br/>- Moglo bi se reći da je ovo prirodna progresija sigurnosti i tehnologije: od podizanja tehničkih kontrola do pomicanja steka prema ponašanju i ljudima. Naravno, za ova tri glavna pitanja može se reći da probijanje kroz firewall i mrežne segmente, ali to je priroda tih stvari (društveni mediji - udaranje kroz firewall je daleko drugačije od mene probijanje kroz SSH vezu za premošćivanje moje kućne mreže; društveni mediji su slični *putu* koristim svoju SSH vezu nakon što je držanje već udareno jer je potrebno; odnosno društveni mediji je način na koji se koristi luka 80.)<br/><br/>U osnovi, sve indikacije ukazuju na to da se ova dihotomija ne iznenađuje, i ne mislim da je to neka daljnja indikacija da IT/sigurnost to radi pogrešno, ili da nije pravilno usklađena s poslom, ili da ima tehničku mračno-server-sobnu pozadinu. Ne kažem da radimo stvari kako treba ili smo pravilno usklađeni, ali gore navedeno nije dobar argument koji podržava teoriju tih nedostataka.<br/><br/>Usporedio bih trenutno povećanje mobilnog računarstva da bude veliko kao uvođenje računara u biznis, a kasnije i PC/internet u biznis. Nisam bio u blizini kada se to dogodilo, niti sam bio u industriji kada je osobna računalna revolucija upala u posao, ali kladim se da je to najbliža usporedba do sada. - Ovo su nove i velike su promjene izvan samo dovođenja Maca ili novog softvera ili nekog novog poslovnog procesa. |
