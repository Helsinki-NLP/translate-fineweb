| The Masterpiece: a Chain Poetry Challenge<br/><br/>John has been writing poetry since his school days. He was awarded the "Best Poet 2014 and 2021" Hubby Awards.<br/><br/>Madame Monet in a Japanese kimono, 1875<br/><br/>Claude Monet [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>A Brief History of Collaborative, Collective, or Chain Poetry<br/><br/>Collaborative,collective, or chain poetry is an alternative and creative technique for writing poetry by more than one person. The principal aim of this type of poetry is to create poems through the collaboration of various authors/poets, trying to form a unified voice while still maintain their individual voices.<br/><br/>Examples of collaboration abound in Japanese poetry. Though the precise accounts and records of many such events are either lost or missing.<br/><br/>One of the most famous examples of collective poetry writing was the poem collection titled Ralentir Travaux by Surrealist French poets André Breton, Paul Éluard and René Char. These three poets collaborated to write the poems in this collection over just five days in 1930.<br/><br/>During the 1940s, Charles Henri Ford, an American poet, invented what he called the "chain poem", where each poet wrote a line and then sent the poem to another person (to continue) in another part of the world, by post.<br/><br/>In 2007 a collection of American collaborative poetry Saints of Hysteria: A Half-Century of Collaborative American Poetry was edited and published by Denise Duhamel, Maureen Seaton and David Trinidad.<br/><br/>Collaborative poetry writing has been used in schools and colleges to teach students teamwork and to discover ways in which they are connected.(source: Wikipedia)<br/><br/>Study of a Figure Outdoors: Woman with a Parasol, facing left, 1886<br/><br/>Claude Monet [Public domain or Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>The Aim of This Article and How to Approach the Challenge<br/><br/>A few years back I wrote an article called "Poem Without an End" which included a Christmas poem I had written that lent itself to being added to. I was amazed by the response as at that stage I only had a few followers here. People wrote a stanza of poetry each in "comments" on the hub to follow on from the previous commenter's stanza. It worked out very well and at the end I compiled all the contributions into a single poem as part of the hub.<br/><br/>Similar challenges have been issued since, including one by Frank Atanacio called "Spirits Sat as Mourners" that was also very successful. The difference being that in that instance contributors wrote their own hubs for their stanza of poetry and placed a link on Frank's original hub.<br/><br/>For this particular challenge I don't expect everyone to spend valuable time writing separate hubs for one stanza of poetry (unless you really want to). The main problem being that to make it effective you would have to copy the previously written parts of the poem onto your hub and would probably be hit with "duplication" label.<br/><br/>So, that being the case, and also to save having to leave links everywhere, I just ask that anyone who wants to take part just write their stanza here in "comments." Check the last comment before yours that is contributing to the challenge and follow on. If I see more than one following from the same stanza I will use my poetic licence to work them in as I deem best.<br/><br/>At some stage when I feel there has been enough stanzas added I will probably call an end to the challenge and then compile them all together as the completed poem as part of the article (also giving credit to each contributor).<br/><br/>Flowered Riverbank, Argenteuil<br/><br/>Claude Monet [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>The Challenge!<br/><br/>Now comes the interesting part. If you join this chain poetry challenge you have to try to keep the style and voice of the poem as close as possible to the preceding verses, so that to uninformed readers it will appear that only one author has written the entire poem.<br/><br/>Sounds easy, you say? Well maybe it would be if the poem had a traditional style, rhyme or meter. But this one doesn't! The poem you will be adding to was started by an acquaintance of mine Andriealphus as a "chain poem challenge" elsewhere. At the time of writing I was the only other person who had accepted the challenge, and because I loved the subject I thought it would be a great challenge for my fellow writers and decided to use it here and see if the response would be better. (I know of a few poets here whose writing would suit this style)<br/><br/>Rules :<br/><br/>Follow on from the previous stanza in comments<br/><br/>Try to retain the voice and style of the poem<br/><br/>Keep your stanza/verse to approximately the same length as those before<br/><br/>Claude Monet was one of the most famous painters in the history of art and a leading figure in the Impressionist movement.<br/><br/>In 1883 Monet moved to Giverny. Here, he loved to paint outdoors in the gardens that he helped create. The water lilies found in the pond had a particular appeal, and he painted several series of them throughout the rest of his life; the Japanese-style bridge over the pond became the subject of several works, as well.<br/><br/>In 1912 Monet painted a series of 12 waterlily paintings commissioned by the Orangerie des Tuileries, a museum in Paris. He chose to make them on a very large scale, and to serve as a "haven of peaceful meditation." This project consumed much of Monet's later years. Monet once stated, "These landscapes of water and reflection have become an obsession for me. It is beyond my strength as an old man, and yet I want to render what I feel."<br/><br/>His health was now an obstacle, as well. Nearly blind, with both of his eyes seriously affected by cataracts, Monet finally agreed to undergo surgery for the ailment in 1923.<br/><br/>Monet's famous water lilies turned redder as his cataracts progressed. After getting corrective surgery he destroyed most of the "red lily" paintings, angry that no one really mentioned it to him. Ironically, these paintings were probably what made his impressionistic style so famous in that time -- artists started taking more risks with color and such during this point. (source: biography.com)<br/><br/>The Masterpiece<br/><br/>"The boy sitting behind you says you look like a masterpiece.<br/><br/>Ask him, has he ever seen a Monet up close?<br/><br/>Close enough to see nothing but muddled strokes of weedy lakeshore?<br/><br/>Close enough to dip his fingers into the ridges<br/><br/>where oil paints hardened under an artist's gaze?<br/><br/>Close enough to breathe onto the blood lilies?<br/><br/>Ask him, why did he paint them red?" (Andriealphus)<br/><br/>He grinned like Carroll's cheshire cat.<br/><br/>"Through clouded and bloodshot eyes I imagine.<br/><br/>Be my waterlilies!" he says,<br/><br/>"Feel my breath and let my fingers delve,<br/><br/>become my masterpiece instead.<br/><br/>A brush has never touched a canvas as fine as your fair skin.<br/><br/>Let the masters weep in jealousy,<br/><br/>and Van Gogh slice his ear in envy at the beauty of your nakedness."(Jodah)<br/><br/>Self portrait with bandaged ear<br/><br/>Vincent van Gogh [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>Responses<br/><br/>Now it's your turn. Please write your response in the comments below, remembering to check those immediately before yours for the last written stanza of the poem. If you do decide to write a separate hub for your stanza of verse, make sure you leave a link here in comments.<br/><br/>The Finished Masterpiece<br/><br/>All contributions have been received and I have put the finished poem together with only some slight edits. I hope everyone is happy with the result. If you think I could improve the order of stanzas etc, feel free to let me know.<br/><br/>Comments<br/><br/>Hey Diana, looks like I have to go add another stanza to the finished poem :)<br/><br/>Thanks for this contribution.Quite beautiful.<br/><br/>Diana L Pierce from Potter County, Pa. on September 19, 2015:<br/><br/>No tears splash water below,<br/><br/>From the bridge beneath his feet,<br/><br/>Nor can his brush paint his thoughts,<br/><br/>From the mystery maid he seeks.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 21, 2015:<br/><br/>Thank you Cris, I am sure everyone appreciates your comment.

And the beauty we can still enjoy today from all his work.<br/><br/>This is a great challenge! I am really looking forward to adding to this.<br/><br/>I first wanted to stop in and let you know that, up for sure. Shared too.<br/><br/>And thank you so much for all the challenges to help the rest of us, keep our mental energy flowing and giving it a work out! You are the best.<br/><br/>The information about LuLu and the free ISBN number is an answered prayer! So, smile my friend. You are a gift!<br/><br/>Hugs. :-)<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 12, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi again Marj. I think I may have all the verses that are going to come. I have been doing my best to arrange them as I think best with just a little editing. I will probably post the finished poem as a separate hub with a link on this one to it. My book is available on Lulu and iBooks...there's a link on one of the earlier comments. I'd really appreciate it if you were to purhase a copy. Bear in mind it's my first eBook so the formatting etc isn't perfect, but it's taken me seven revisions I think to get it where it is. It will all be easier next time. If you need help let me know.<br/><br/>travmaj from australia on August 12, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi John, you have certainly had some excellent responses to your challenge - I'm sure you'll fuse it altogether beautifully although I imagine a difficult task. I'm interested in your poetry books also - I really have to get my act together technologically - I'll try and check it all out...cheers -<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi Jo, both books 'On the Wings of Eagles" and "I Laughed a Smile" have mostly the same content...except the former has one extra poem. Originally they were in different formats, one ePub, the other PDF but now they are both ePub. They are available through Lulu and iBooks, soon Barnes and Noble and Nook (not Amazon). I may try publishing another book through Amazon soon just to see how it compares. Thanks again.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>John, thanks a lot, the info on publishing with Lulu will be quite useful as I'm thinking of publishing but I'm currently torn between Amazon and Lulu. I wanted to purchase one of your books, but I couldn't seem to find them on Amazon. However, I'll probably get it from Lulu. Wishing you every success, you deserve it.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Hey Phyllis, thanks for ontributing. I like it, a perfect ending to the poem I think.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks Faith.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi Jo, I think I have sorted out the poem satisfactorily. Just waiting to see if there is any more to add. Publishing with Lulu wasn't bad and now that I've done it once it will be easier next time. Getting the formatting to look right in the eBook was the hardest, though you and just type it in a word document and Lulu automatically produces the contents page and converts the document to ePub or PDF you can only use certain fonts and have to make sure the chapter names or poem titles are in Heading 1. They also provide a free ISBN number if you want. Overall it was easier than expected however.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Phyllis, this is succinct and beautiful, I love it. Shyron's did an excellent job also, I thought I'd already commented on her verse, but I hadn't.<br/><br/>Phyllis Doyle Burns from High desert of Nevada. on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Wonderful hub, great idea, Jodah. Here is one from me. Short but sweet. Hope it is okay:<br/><br/>And this the beauty be<br/><br/>From Masters past we see<br/><br/>Impressed upon the boy<br/><br/>Bestowed on her with joy<br/><br/>Faith Reaper from southern USA on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks John and Jo. You are kind. Jo, you have always been a brilliant poet. I, too, am looking forward to the end result after John does his magic to pull it all together.<br/><br/>I will share again to see if there are any more takers.<br/><br/>Blessings<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Faith, beautifully done, I find it incredible how someone with such limited vision can teach us so much about beauty, light and shadows. John, looking forward to reading the end result.<br/><br/>By the way, congtats on publishing your poems. How did you find the process of publishing with Lulu?<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks for your great submission Faith. No it's not too late, I'm still compiling the final poem so it should be up for all to see in a day or two.<br/><br/>Faith Reaper from southern USA on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi John,<br/><br/>I apologize for my late submission here to your wonderful challenge. I am off from work a couple of day and decided to give this a go while my husband is resting from knee surgery. If it does not meet with your standards, please feel free to not use it in your final poem or edit as you deem necessary.<br/><br/>Blessings always<br/><br/>Here it goes:<br/><br/>Confessions to friend Georges Clemenceau<br/><br/>Of light encapsulating both torment, joy<br/><br/>Fervent madness in analyzing colors<br/><br/>Consequential spontaneous creations<br/><br/>Season after season of obsession<br/><br/>Capturing different hues in a single moment<br/><br/>Attentive while strolling in Argenteuill<br/><br/>Brushwork bares masterpiece.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 09, 2015:<br/><br/>Just a shout out to see if anyone else still wants to contribute to this chain poem. I have started compiling the stanzas together but will leave it open for a couple more days in case anyone else is intending to join in. Thanks to all who have contributed.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 02, 2015:<br/><br/>Thank you Genna. It appears Monet is a favourite arist of many here. I hope you'll take part in this challenge too :)<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 02, 2015:<br/><br/>Thank you for a great contribution Shyron. This is a very nice verse. Well done.<br/><br/>Genna East from Massachusetts, USA on August 02, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi John...<br/><br/>I started to read this wonderful challenge (Monet is one of my favorite artists), then came back to finish reading some of the beautiful contributions that give this painting a stunning voice through perception and the senses. What an exciting hub. :-)<br/><br/>Shyron E Shenko from Texas on August 02, 2015:<br/><br/>Following Jo (tobusiness)<br/><br/>"The pure white of the lily's skin<br/><br/>Speaks of no beauty from within<br/><br/>Just Monet's way or goal<br/><br/>For feasting eyes<br/><br/>Not feasting for the soul"<br/><br/>Shyron<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 02, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks for returning Kim, I'm so pleased with the responses. Just gave to wait and see if there are any more.<br/><br/>ocfireflies from North Carolina on August 02, 2015:<br/><br/>John,<br/><br/>So happy every time I return to see another link in this poetic chain, and Wow, does Jo ever do it justice.<br/><br/>Kim<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 02, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi John, 'sublime' will do nicely. I'm so glad you like my contribution. This is a very good idea, I know you'll have fun putting it all together. Take care and my best to you.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks Deb, yes I am impressed by the standard of submissions. I'm looking forward to putting it all together.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Yes Ann, it is good to see the poets among us take up the challenge with some great contributions so far. I just hope Imcan do it justice when it comes to putting it together.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Well done Jo. The word "sublime" comes to mind. I hoped all the poets would rise to the fore, and they have. Love it, thanks for contributing.<br/><br/>Deb Hirt from Stillwater, OK on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>I am excited to see what you end up with here. There are a number of fine poets rising to the challenge, so go to it!<br/><br/>Ann Carr from SW England on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Great one, Jo!<br/><br/>You've got everyone going, John! Rather you than me, putting all this together, but it's going to be a humdinger of a poem when it finally comes to an end - if it ever does! You've really started something.<br/><br/>Ann<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Ok, John here goes nothing! Following from Kim's. I hope it reads well.<br/><br/>And the boy began to walk away<br/><br/>But in his wake, I heard him say<br/><br/>"I took a trip to Orangerie<br/><br/>Where the ghost of Monet still abides<br/><br/>I sat right down and gazed awhile<br/><br/>Until I heard a soft voice cry.<br/><br/>"Have you ever seen a fluid dream?<br/><br/>Where light evolves into what it touch<br/><br/>Where serenity flows through cloudy veil<br/><br/>Where the magician's brush like lightening rush<br/><br/>Have you ever seen a sight sublime?<br/><br/>A child born of distorted illusion<br/><br/>This flowering pond that traps the light<br/><br/>That lift the heart and beckons the soul<br/><br/>An abstract pulchritude up close<br/><br/>Move back, behold; such tranquil delight."<br/><br/>I hope this is in line with what the others have done. Feel free to edit if needed. My best...<br/><br/>Jo.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Alrighty!<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Yes Jo, please do. Anyone is welcome to do more than one stanza. I may add another myself at some stage.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>John, I've decided to have a go, but it's about 16 lines, can I do it in two stanzas following on from Kim's wonderful submission? You can always edit it later.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on July 31, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi Jo, sorry to hear you are under the weather at the moment. I am not in a hurry to close this challenge so I'll keep it open until you are back firing on all cylinders and are able to contribute. You are one of the hubbers I was looking forward to getting a response from as I thought it would suit. Thank you for your kind words, and get well soon.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on July 31, 2015:<br/><br/>Wow! John I can't believe I almost missed your incredible challenged. This is something in which I would have loved to participate since Claude Monet is one of my all times favourite artist. Unfortunately, I must cry off. I'm a bit under the weather with a head full of cotton wool, or so it seems. If the challenge is still open when I get rid of this pesky flu I may give it a go, but I must say, the standard is exceptionally high. Maj took it to another level but all the submissions are brilliant. Kudos to you Andriealphus and the other writers who participated so far in this artistic and creative masterpiece.<br/><br/>My best always Jo.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on July 31, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi again Maj, glad this poem inspired you, and yes it beats watching the cricket especially with the Aussie batsmen performing badly in this third test. It will be an interesting exercise for me to fuse all the stanzas together but should be good.<br/><br/>travmaj from australia on July 30, 2015:<br/><br/>John, thank you, I'm most happy you like my offering. I found the poem intriguing and suddenly felt inspired to write my version in the same mode. I'm not sure I wrote a continuation from the stanza before (alwaysexploring) but I'm sure you will fuse it altogether when the time comes. Love all the responses. I haven't managed any creative writing for yonks, can't wait now to start over, just need some time. (beats watching the cricket too!!!) Cheers John, will be checking in -<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on July 30, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks for checking Dana. I am pleased with the quality of responses so far. I just have to wait and see how many more come in. The final,poem should be great.<br/><br/>Dana Tate from LOS ANGELES on July 30, 2015:<br/><br/>Just checking in to see how things are going, I can't wait for the finished product. I attended a poetry class and we did this also it was really fun.<br/><br/>ocfireflies from North Carolina on July 29, 2015:<br/><br/>John,<br/><br/>Thanks so much for providing the platform for without that it is easy to fall down.<br/><br/>; ) Kim<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on July 29, 2015:<br/><br/>Thank you Devika. I haven't seen you around in awhile, I hope all is well.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on July 29, 2015:<br/><br/>Beautiful work Kim. It will follow on perfectly from Maj's as you answered the GIverny question. I am so pleased with the quality of responses so far.<br/><br/>ocfireflies from North Carolina on July 29, 2015:<br/><br/>John,<br/><br/>I had sent this earlier before travmaj's awesome contribution, but maybe it still works (I did a little tweaking)<br/><br/>following as opposed to prior--don't know if<br/><br/>I am making any sense. If it does not work, please feel free to delete and I will try again. | Kryevepër: një zinxhir poezish<br/><br/>Gjoni ka shkruar poezi që nga koha e tij e shkollës.

Qëllimi kryesor i këtij lloji të poezisë është krijimi i poemave përmes bashkëpunimit të autorëve/poeteve të ndryshme, duke u përpjekur për të formuar një zë të unifikuar ndërsa ende mbajnë zërat e tyre individualë.<br/><br/>Shembuj të bashkëpunimit me poezi japoneze.Megjithëse llogaritë e sakta dhe të dhënat e shumë ngjarjeve të tilla janë ose të humbura.<br/><br/>Një nga shembujt më të famshëm të shkrimit të poezisë kolektive ishte koleksioni poemë i titulluar Ralentir Travaux nga poetët surrealist francezë André Breton, Paul Éluard dhe René Char. Këta tre poetë bashkëpunuan për të shkruar poezitë në këtë koleksion gjatë vetëm pesë ditëve në vitin 1930.<br/><br/>Gjatë viteve 1940, Charles Henri Ford, një poet amerikan shpiku atë që ai e quajti "poema zinxhir", ku çdo poet shkroi një linjë dhe më pas ia dërgoi poemën një personi tjetër (për të vazhduar) në një pjesë tjetër të botës, me postë.<br/><br/>Në vitin 2007 një koleksion i poetisë amerikane për bashkëpunim Saints of Hysteria: Një gjysmë shekulli i poezisë bashkëpunuese amerikane u botua dhe u botua nga Denise Duhamel, Maureen Seaton dhe David Trinidad.<br/><br/>Shkrimi me poezi bashkëpunuese është përdorur në shkolla dhe kolegje për të mësuar punën e nxënësve dhe për të zbuluar mënyra në të cilat ata janë të lidhur.

Njerëzit shkruan një stanza e poezisë çdo në "komentë" në qendër për të ndjekur nga stanza e mëparshme e komentit.Ajo ka punuar shumë mirë dhe në fund unë përpilova të gjitha kontributet në një poemë të vetme si pjesë e qendrës.<br/><br/>Që nga ajo kohë janë dhënë sfida të ngjashme, duke përfshirë një nga Frank Atanacio i quajtur "Spirts Sat si vajtar" që gjithashtu ishte shumë i suksesshëm. Dallimi është se në atë rast kontribuesit shkruan qendrat e tyre për stanza e tyre të poezisë dhe vendosën një lidhje në qendrën origjinale të Frankut.<br/><br/>Për këtë sfidë të veçantë unë nuk pres që të gjithë të kalojnë qendrat e vlefshme të shkrimit kohë të veçantë për një stanza e poezisë (përveç nëse ju me të vërtetë duan të). Problemi kryesor është se për të bërë atë efektiv ju do të keni për të kopjuar pjesët e mëparshme të shkruar të poemës në shpërndarësin tuaj dhe ndoshta do të goditej me etiketë "dyfishimi".<br/><br/>Pra, duke qenë rasti, dhe gjithashtu për të shpëtuar duke lënë lidhje kudo, thjesht kërkoj që kushdo që dëshiron të marrë pjesë vetëm shkruani stanza e tyre në "komente". Kontrolloni komentin e fundit para juaj që është kontribuar për sfidën dhe ndiqni. Nëse shoh më shumë se një pas nga të njëjtën stanza unë do të përdor licencën time poetike për të punuar ato në siç e konsideroj më të mirë.<br/><br/>Në një fazë kur unë mendoj se ka pasur mjaft stanzas shtuar unë ndoshta do të thërrasë një fund të sfidës dhe pastaj të përpilojë të gjithë së bashku si poemë përfunduar si pjesë e artikullit ( gjithashtu duke i dhënë kredi çdo kontribuesi).<br/><br/>Flowered Riverbank, Argenteuil<br/><br/>Claude Monet [Domen Publik], nëpërmjet Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>Sfida!<br/><br/>Tani vjen pjesa interesante. Nëse bashkoheni në këtë sfidë të poezisë zinxhir ju duhet të përpiqeni të mbani stilin dhe zërin e poemës sa më afër vargjeve paraardhëse, në mënyrë që lexuesit e painformuar të shfaqet se vetëm një autor ka shkruar të gjithë poemën.<br/><br/>Epo ndoshta do të ishte nëse poema do të kishte një stil tradicional, rimë ose njehsorë, por kjo poemë do t'ju shtonte një të njohur të Andriealphus tim si një "sfidë poeme zinxhir" diku tjetër. Në kohën e shkrimit isha i vetmi person tjetër që kishte pranuar sfidën dhe sepse e doja këtë temë, mendova se do të ishte një sfidë e madhe për shkrimtarët e mi të tjerë dhe vendosa ta përdorja këtu dhe të shihja nëse përgjigja do të ishte më e mirë. (E di për disa poetë këtu shkrimi i të cilëve do t’i shkonte për shtat këtij stili)<br/><br/>Rregullat :<br/><br/>Ndiqni nga stanza e mëparshme në komente<br/><br/>Mundohuni të mbajë zërin dhe stilin e poemës<br/><br/>Mbani stanza / varg tuaj për të përafërsisht të njëjtën gjatësi si ato më parë<br/><br/>Claude Monet ishte një nga piktorët më të njohur në historinë e artit dhe një figurë udhëheqëse në lëvizjen Impresioniste.<br/><br/>Në vitin 1883 Monet u zhvendos në Givenry. Këtu, ai donte të pikturonte jashtë në kopshtet që ai ndihmoi për të krijuar. Zambakët e ujit të gjetur në pellg kishin një apel të veçantë dhe ai pikturonte disa prej tyre gjatë gjithë jetës së tij; ura e stilit japonez mbi pellg u bë gjithashtu subjekt i disa veprave.<br/><br/>Në vitin 1912 Monet pikturoi një seri pikturash ujore të porositura nga Orangerie des Tuileries, një muze në Paris dhe zgjodhi t'i bënte ato në një shkallë shumë të madhe, dhe të shërbente si një "Kavan i meditimit paqësor". Ky projekt harxhoi shumë nga vitet e mëvonshme të Monetit. Monet njëherë deklaroi, “Këto peizazhe të ujit dhe të reflektimit janë bërë një mani për mua.Ai është përtej forcës sime si njeri i moshuar, dhe ende dua të bëj atë që ndjej.”<br/><br/>Shëndeti i tij ishte tani një pengesë, gjithashtu, Pothuajse të verbër, me të dy sytë e tij të prekur seriozisht nga kataraktat, Monet në fund ra dakord t'i nënshtrohet operacionit për sëmundjen në 1923.<br/><br/>Zambakët e famshëm të ujit të Malit kthyen prapa ndërsa kataraktat e tij përparonin.Pas marrjes së operacionit korrigjues ai shkatërroi pjesën më të madhe të pikturave " zambaku i kuq", i zemëruar që askush nuk i përmendi vërtet atij. Ironikisht, këto piktura ishin ndoshta ajo që e bëri stilin e tij impresionues aq të famshëm në atë kohë – artistët nisën të merrnin më shumë rreziqe me ngjyra dhe të tilla gjatë kësaj pike.

| First of all EEQT itself needs to be further developed in order to provide a theoretical and computational answer to the needs of modern quantum engineering<br/>and technology. We need to include classical systems with infinite<br/>numbers of degrees of freedom - like electromagnetic and/or gravitational<br/>field. We also need to include infinite quantum systems so as<br/>to understand and simulate Bose gas and its phase transitions. But, there<br/>are also steps that must be taken far beyond the paradigm of EEQT.<br/>As we have emphasized so many times: quantum theory has yet<br/>to be understood in terms of a "non-linear classical theory." But what we mean by a "classical theory" is something much more advanced and more<br/>general than clasical mechanics or classical field theory. By a "classical theory" we mean first of all, a theory that is not based<br/>on probabilities from the start; a theory in which probabilities appear at a<br/>later stage, derived from the theory; derived perhaps, in a necessary way. Such a theory must not only specify the mathematical objects and their relations but also make "predictions".<br/>A classical theory is, in particular, a theory in which discrete events can happen, events that are "objective." They may be events that affect mainly the physical stratum, but they may be also "mental<br/>events," changes of states of "consciousness;" whatever they are, even if they<br/>are concerned with branchings of universes, - they DO HAPPEN.<br/>Such a theory, encompassing the quantum theory as we know it today,<br/>does not yet exist, but we can envisage its possible shape. Nothing serves better than an example, so let us give here an example of how<br/>such a theory can be construed.<br/>Imagine a theory developed a'la Einstein's unified field theory, but<br/>with variable metric signature, possibly with a complex causal web, multiple<br/>Einstein-Rosen [40] (see also [41]) bridges,<br/>time loops, nondifferrentiability, fractal structure, all of that additionally complicated by variable dimensionality of space and of "time" (cf [42]. Imagine such a theory to be able to accomodate all the four fundamental<br/>forces known to us, but it also involves an extra field, which is different<br/>from physical fields, and which is non-local in the sense that it does not<br/>survive taking a macro-average-limit when causal space-time<br/>structure of Einstein's general relativity is recovered. This extra field<br/>would be a place for "thought forms" and our theory would couple these<br/>thought forms to more "physical" levels of reality. The very concept of<br/>"time" would arise only in one particular limiting structure. Nothing<br/>prevents a theory of such a type to have mathematical structures rich enough to accomodate consciousness and mind. Due to its complexity,<br/>density of time-loops, bubble-like causal structure, making predictions<br/>in such theory is possible only by applying probability -<br/>as it is the case with systems evolving according to deterministic<br/>but chaotic dynamics. Quantum wave function would emerge in such a<br/>theory as an effective way of predicting. That type of explanation<br/>of quantum indeterminism was postulated long ago by I. J. Good. In<br/>[3] he speculated that<br/>quantum indeterminism can be understood if we admit that individual quantum events that actually happen here and now have future<br/>advanced causes as well has past retarded causes.<br/>A glimpse of such a thought<br/>may have occured to Alan Turing when he wrote his famous, already quoted sentence: "prediction must be linear, description must be nonlinear."<br/>A theory going partially in this direction is being developed by L. Nottale<br/>[43] who states the observation, attributed to Feynman, that "the typical paths of quantum mechanical particles are continuous non-differentiable." Then he continues his development of fractal<br/>space-time ideas to conclude with: "The quantum behavior becomes, in this theory,<br/>a manifestation of the fractal geometry of space-time, in the same way gravitation is, in Einstein's theory of general (motion-)relativity, a manifestation of the curvature of space-time.<br/>Another step in this direction comes from the work of Russian scientists - which started with the most original ideas of N.A. Kozyrev [44]<br/>and A. Sakharov [45], and is being developed in Moscow, the Urals and Siberia, see e.g. [46, 47, 48]. | Para së gjithash, EEQT duhet të zhvillohet më tej në mënyrë që të japë një përgjigje teorike dhe kompjuterike për nevojat e inxhinierisë dhe teknologjisë moderne kuantike. Ne duhet të përfshijmë sisteme klasike me shkallë të pafundme lirie - si fusha elektromagnetike dhe/ose gravitacionale.Ne gjithashtu duhet të përfshijmë sisteme kuantike të pafundme në mënyrë që të kuptojmë dhe simulojmë gazin e Bose dhe tranzicionet në fazën e tij. Por, ka edhe hapa që duhet të ndërmerren shumë përtej paradigmës së EEQT.<br/>Siç kemi theksuar kaq shumë herë: Teoria kuantike ende nuk ka kuptuar në aspektin e një "teorie klasike jo-lineare". Por ajo që nënkuptojmë me një "teori klasike" është diçka shumë më e avancuar dhe më e përgjithshme sesa mekanika klasike ose teoria klasike e fushës. Me një "teori klasike" nënkuptojmë para së gjithash, një teori që nuk është e bazuar në probabilitet nga fillimi; një teori në të cilën shanset shfaqen në një fazë të mëvonshme, rrjedh nga teoria; që rrjedh ndoshta, në një mënyrë të nevojshme. Një teori e tillë nuk duhet të specifikojë vetëm objektet matematikore dhe marrëdhëniet e tyre, por gjithashtu të bëjë "parashikime".<br/>Një teori klasike është, në veçanti, një teori në të cilën ngjarjet diskrete mund të ndodhin, ngjarje që janë "objektive". Ato mund të jenë ngjarje që ndikojnë kryesisht në stratumin fizik, por mund të jenë edhe "ngjarje mendore", ndryshime të gjendjeve të "ndërgjegjësisë" pavarësisht nga ato, edhe nëse janë të shqetësuar me degët e universeve, - ata DO HAPPEN.<br/>Një teori e tillë, që përfshin teorinë kuantike siç e dimë sot, nuk ekziston ende, por ne mund të parashikojmë formën e tij të mundshme. Asgjë nuk shërben më mirë se një shembull, kështu që të japim këtu një shembull se si mund të interpretohet një teori e tillë.<br/>Imagjinoni një teori të zhvilluar teorinë e fushës së një 'la Einstein', por me nënshkrim të ndryshueshëm metrike, ndoshta me një web kompleks të rastësishëm, të shumëfishtë<br/>[40] (shih gjithashtu [41] urat, sy sythe kohore, mosdurueshmëri, strukturë e pjesshme, të gjitha që ndërlikohen më tej nga dimensioni i ndryshueshëm i hapësirës dhe i "kohës" (cf [42]. Imagjinoni një teori të tillë që të jetë në gjendje të akomodojë të gjitha katër forcat themelore të njohura për ne, por gjithashtu përfshin një fushë shtesë, e cila është e ndryshme nga fushat fizike dhe e cila është jo-lokale në kuptimin që nuk mbijeton duke marrë një kufi makro-mesataror kur struktura rastësore e relativitetit të përgjithshëm të Ajnshtajnit është shëruar. Kjo fushë shtesë do të ishte një vend për "forma mendimi" dhe teoria jonë do të çiftonte këto forma mendimi në nivele më "fizike" të realitetit.<br/>Koha" do të lindte vetëm në një strukturë të veçantë kufizuese.Asgjë nuk parandalon një teori të një lloji të tillë që të ketë struktura matematikore të pasura mjaft për të akomoduar vetëdijen dhe mendjen. Për shkak të kompleksitetit të saj, densitetit të sytheve me kohë, strukturës së rastësishme me flluska, duke bërë parashikime në teori të tilla është e mundur vetëm duke aplikuar probabilitetin -<br/>pasi është rasti me sistemet që evoluojnë sipas dinamikës përcaktuese, por kaotike.Funksioni i valës kuantike do të dilte në një teori të tillë si një mënyrë efektive për të parashikuar. Ky lloj shpjegimi për indet kuantike u postua shumë kohë më parë nga I. J. Good. In<br/>[3] ai spekuloi se Biterminizmi kuantik mund të kuptohet nëse pranojmë se ngjarjet kuantike individuale që në fakt ndodhin këtu dhe tani kanë shkaqe të përparuara të ardhshme, si dhe ka shkaqet e mëparshme.<br/>Një paraqitje e një mendimi të tillë mund të ketë ndodhur në Alan Turing kur ai shkroi fjalinë e tij të famshme, tashmë të cituar: "parashikimi duhet të jetë linear, përshkrimi duhet të jetë jolinear."<br/>Një teori që po shkon pjesërisht në këtë drejtim po zhvillohet nga L. Nottale<br/>[43] i cili thotë se vëzhgimi, i atribuohet Feynman-it, se "rrugët tipike të grimcave mekanike kuantike janë të vazhdueshme jo të ndryshme." Pastaj ai vazhdon zhvillimin e tij të ideve të kohës së pjesshme hapësirë-kohë për të përfunduar me: "sjellja kuantike bëhet, në këtë teori, një manifestim i gjeometrisë së thyer të hapësirë-kohës, në të njëjtën mënyrë është gravitacioni, në teorinë e përgjithshme (lëvizja-) relativitetit, një manifestim i kurbaturës së hapësirë-kohës.<br/>Një hap tjetër në këtë drejtim vjen nga puna e shkencëtarëve rusë - i cili filloi me idetë më origjinale të N.A. Kozyrev [44]<br/>dhe A. Sakharov [45], dhe është duke u zhvilluar në Moskë, Uralet dhe Siberi, shih p.sh. [46, 47, 48]. |
| Best Nutrition And Exercise For Lose Weight<br/><br/>How is breakfast really healthy?<br/><br/>In the morning like an emperor, at noon like a king, in the evening like a beggar – goes a well-known proverb. A study by the medical organization Endocrine Society confirms the key message behind the saying: It shows that breakfast plays a more important role than is often assumed. In the morning, the human body actually has more than twice as high a metabolic activity as at other times of the day: A large breakfast not only keeps you full for a long time, blood sugar and insulin levels also rise slowly. The appetite for sweets is regulated, we eat snacks less often during the day. Therefore, breakfast should not be skipped even during a diet.<br/><br/>Of course, having a big breakfast doesn't mean that we should have several croissants with nut nougat cream and sweet breakfast pancakes in the morning. Breakfast is healthy best when it is high in protein and fiber, as well as providing vitamins and minerals. Whole grain bread or muesli, oat flakes, fruits and nuts are energy suppliers that are good for you and keep you full for a long time.<br/><br/>The fact that a large breakfast is better than a large dinner does not necessarily mean that breakfast is essential for losing weight. A meta-analysis carried out in 2019 showed, that the total daily energy intake of people who eat breakfast is on average higher, than that of those who do not have breakfast. The latter were on average just under half a kilo lighter. So, according to the results of this major study, you don't necessarily have to eat breakfast if you want to lose weight.<br/><br/>Lose weight with the right diet – that's how easy it is to put healthy on your plate<br/><br/>Eating healthy in no way means less taste. Fresh vegetables, fish or meat as protein sources and other healthy ingredients conjure up taste in the pot and a smile on your lips – ideally also when you step on the scales. A US study has shown that people who cook their own food and consciously deal with what they eat have a body mass index in the normal range. Restaurant visits or fast food, on the other hand, quickly lure you into the sugar trap: Often there is no indication of how much sugar is in salad dressings, how much fat the potatoes were fried in or whether the meat was not treated.<br/><br/>A healthy lunch consists of three parts – the largest part is fruits or vegetables and should cover half of the plate. A quarter of the meal should consist of protein, i.e. fish, meat or tofu. The remaining quarter consists of carbohydrates and is ideally made from whole grain products. Important: Don't eat at your desk in the office, but stimulate your metabolism and ideally take a short walk before or after lunch.<br/><br/>When should you eat to lose weight?<br/><br/>In the evening, you should focus on light meals that are rather low in carbohydrates. These are the least likely to cause insulin to skyrocket, which is good for our body. Vegetables, dairy products and nuts, for example, are well suited for this.<br/><br/>You should also be careful not to have dinner too late. It is best to have eaten until 7 p.m. – then the body can relax and prepare for the night. Sufficient sleep is important for healthy weight loss. A US study found that people who slept about eight hours a night had better fat deposits. So good night! Allow yourself more than six hours of sleep so that you can start the next day fit and refreshed.<br/><br/>Losing weight without exercise – is it really possible?<br/><br/>It would be so easy, if the dream weight could be achieved simply by lowering the calorie intake. But you probably know the wisdom that diet is only one side of the coin and exercise is the other. So nothing helps: Put on your sportswear and off you go!<br/><br/>Anyone who, in addition to the sports program such as jogging, walking or swimming, also lets the elevator go alone and takes the stairs, takes a little detour or uses the bike instead of the car, is doing wellis also called something good. Even simple walking is good for health. | Të ushqyerit më të mirë dhe stërvitje për të humbur peshë<br/><br/>Si është mëngjesi vërtet i shëndetshëm?<br/><br/>Në mëngjes si një perandor, në mesditë si një mbret, në mbrëmje si lypës – shkon një fjalë e urtë e njohur. Një studim i organizatës mjekësore Endocrine Society konfirmon mesazhin kyç pas thënies: Kjo tregon se mëngjesi luan një rol më të rëndësishëm sesa supozohet shpesh. Në mëngjes, trupi i njeriut në fakt ka më shumë se dy herë më shumë një aktivitet metabolik ndërsa në periudha të tjera të ditës: Një mëngjes i madh jo vetëm që ju mban të plotë për një kohë të gjatë, niveli i sheqerit në gjak dhe insulinës gjithashtu rritet ngadalë. oreksi për ëmbëlsirat rregullohet, ne hamë ushqime më pak gjatë ditës.Prandaj, mëngjesi nuk duhet të anashkalohet as gjatë një diete.<br/><br/>Sigurisht, të kesh një mëngjes të madh nuk do të thotë se duhet të kemi disa kryqëzantë me krem nougat të arrës dhe petulla mëngjesi të ëmbla në mëngjes. Mengjesi eshte i shendetshem kur eshte i larte ne proteina dhe fibra, si dhe sigurimi i vitaminave dhe mineraleve.Grecat e plota te grurit ose miuseli, vegjelat, frutat dhe arrat jane furnitoret e energjise qe jane te mire per ju dhe ju mbajne te plote per nje kohe te gjate.<br/><br/>Fakti që një mëngjes i madh është më i mirë se një darkë e madhe nuk do të thotë domosdoshmërisht se mëngjesi është thelbësor për humbjen e peshës. Një meta-analizë e kryer në vitin 2019 tregoi se marrja totale e energjisë së njerëzve që hanë mëngjesin është mesatarisht më e lartë se ata që nuk kanë mëngjes, mesatarisht vetëm nën gjysmë kilogrami. Pra, sipas rezultateve të këtij studimi të madh, nuk keni domosdoshmërisht të hani mëngjes nëse doni të humbni peshë.<br/><br/>Humbur peshë me dietën e duhur - kjo është se sa e lehtë është për të vënë të shëndetshme në pjatë tuaj<br/><br/>Ngrënia e shëndetshme në asnjë mënyrë nuk do të thotë më pak shije. perime të freskëta, peshk ose mish si burime proteinash dhe përbërës të tjerë të shëndetshëm nxisin shijen në tenxhere dhe një buzëqeshje në buzët tuaja - ideale edhe kur hapni peshoren. Një studim amerikan ka treguar se njerëzit që gatuajnë ushqimin e tyre dhe merren me vetëdije me atë që hanë kanë një indeks të masës trupore në intervalin normal. Vizitat e restoranteve ose ushqimet e shpejta, nga ana tjetër, nxitin shpejt në kurthin e sheqerit: Shpesh nuk ka asnjë shenjë se sa sheqer ka në veshjet e sallatës, sa yndyrë patate ishin të skuqura në ose nëse mishi nuk ishte trajtuar.<br/><br/>Një drekë e shëndetshme përbëhet nga tre pjesë - pjesa më e madhe është frutat ose perimet dhe duhet të mbulojë gjysmën e pllakës.Një e katërta e vaktit duhet të përbëhet nga proteina, peshq, mish ose tofu. Tremujori i mbetur përbëhet nga karbohidratet dhe është bërë në mënyrë ideale nga produkte të plota drithi.I rëndësishëm: Mos hani në tryezën tuaj në zyrë, por stimuloni metabolizmin tuaj dhe bëni një shëtitje të shkurtër para ose pas drekës.<br/><br/>Kur duhet të hani për të humbur peshë?<br/><br/>Në mbrëmje, duhet të përqendroheni në vaktet e lehta që janë mjaft të ulëta në karbohidrate.Këto janë më pak të ngjarë të shkaktojnë insulinë në qiellz, gjë që është e mirë për trupin tonë.Për perimet, produktet e qumështit dhe arrat, për shembull, janë të përshtatshme për këtë.<br/><br/>Gjithashtu duhet të keni kujdes që të mos keni darkë shumë vonë.Është mirë që të keni ngrënë deri në 7 p.m. - atëherë trupi mund të relaksohet dhe të përgatitet për natën. Gjumi i mjaftueshëm është i rëndësishëm për humbje peshe të shëndetshme. Një studim amerikan zbuloi se njerëzit që flinin rreth tetë orë në natë kishin depozita më të mira dhjamore. Kështu që natën e mirë! Lejoi veten më shumë se gjashtë orë gjumi në mënyrë që të fillonin të nesërmen të përshtatesh dhe të freskohesh.<br/><br/>Humbja e peshës pa ushtrime – a është me të vërtetë e mundur?<br/><br/>Do të ishte kaq e lehtë, nëse pesha e ëndrrave do të mund të arrihej thjesht duke ulur marrjen e kalorive.Por ju ndoshta e dini urtësinë se dieta është vetëm një anë e monedhës dhe ushtrimeve është tjetër.Pra, asgjë nuk ndihmon: Vendoseni në veshjen tuaj dhe zbrisni!<br/><br/>Kushdo që, përveç programit sportiv si vrapimi, ecja ose noti, lejon që ashensori të shkojë vetëm dhe të marrë shkallët, të marrë një devijim të vogël ose të përdorë biçikletën në vend të makinës, po bën edhe diçka të mirë. Edhe ecje e thjeshtë është e mirë për shëndetin. |
| Why We Open Sourced the Anvil App Server<br/><br/>Why Open Source?<br/><br/>A little while ago, we open-sourced the Anvil App Server. The community reaction has been great, even a little overwhelming (yes, every reply to that announcement really did land in my inbox!). We've already incorporated a bunch of that feedback into our version 1.2 release. But we keep getting asked, " Why did you open-source such a core part of your product? "<br/><br/>Why do this at all?<br/><br/>Anvil is a tool that makes it as simple as possible to build a web app. We do that by enabling you to build the whole application in one language, Python.<br/><br/>Simple hosting is part of that.<br/><br/>The web platform is broken , and Anvil is our attempt to fix it. And, because there is so much complexity in deploying a web app, a cloud-hosted service was the best way to provide the simplicity we want. That way, you can build your app in the Anvil Editor, and make it live on the Internet with one click.<br/><br/>But we kept hearing from people who said, "that's great, but…"<br/><br/>"…but I need to run this on an offshore platform without reliable internet access"<br/><br/>"…but I want to package my app into an IoT device I sell"<br/><br/>or simply, "…but if I'm putting my eggs in this basket, how can I be sure I can still run my app in ten years' time?"<br/><br/>These are all good points! A cloud service isn't the right solution for everyone. If we want to serve these users, there's got to be some way for them to get their apps out of Anvil and run them locally, under their own complete control.<br/><br/>Open Source: Escape hatch, not an ejector seat<br/><br/>We believe in escape hatches, not ejector seats. At conferences, we sometimes get asked, "can I export this as a Flask+JS app?". Sure, it would be possible – we could generate a server package, compile the client-side Python to Javascript, and spit out a classic web app. But it would have serious drawbacks, because:<br/><br/>Not a comfy ride.<br/><br/>Code generation is an ejector seat. Generated code is better than nothing – at least you can edit it! But the moment you edit that code, you lose all the benefits of the system that generated it. If you're using Anvil because of its drag-and-drop editor and Python in the browser, why should our locally-hosted users have to use vim and Javascript?<br/><br/>So we did it the right way: we open-sourced Anvil's runtime engine. It's the same code that serves your app in our hosted service, and it represents your app the same way. You can edit your code with a text editor, run it, then git push it back into our online IDE. It's not an ejector seat: there's no explosive transition. It's an escape hatch: you can climb out, and climb right back in.<br/><br/>What about our business model?<br/><br/>Anvil was never meant to be one of those enterprise low-code systems that charge you $20/mo for each person who uses your app. Anvil is a developer tool. The apps you develop are yours. Enabling you to run them on a Raspberry Pi is cool, but it doesn't change our business model.<br/><br/>We're doing what we always were: We make and sell a development tool that makes it drastically simpler to build web applications. We provide hosting for Anvil apps. We offer the entire development-and-hosting platform on-site for enterprise customers. And, of course, we offer a free plan so that everyone can use Anvil for hobby or educational purposes – or to start building something and see how it goes.<br/><br/>We've open-sourced the Anvil App Server for the (relatively small) number of people who need it, and to provide the ultimate insurance policy. Sure, you can build an app with vim and host it yourself, without even registering an account with us (we've got docs to show you how!). But the Anvil Editor is the world's easiest way to build a web app, and our hosted service is the easiest way to deploy it – so that's what we expect most of our users to continue doing. And you can build with confidence, knowing that the open-source code is right there if you need it.<br/><br/>Try it yourself<br/><br/>If our development philosophy resonates with you, why not try Anvil yourself? | Pse Ne Open Source Server App Anvil<br/><br/>Pse Burimi i Hapur?<br/><br/>Pak më parë, ne kemi hapur-burimin Anvil App Server.Reaksioni i komunitetit ka qenë i madh, madje edhe pak dërrmuese (po, çdo përgjigje ndaj këtij njoftimi ka qenë me të vërtetë vendi në kutinë time!) Ne kemi përfshirë tashmë një grup reagimesh në versionin tonë 1.2. Por ne vazhdojmë të pyesim, "Pse e bëtë këtë pjesë thelbësore të produktit tuaj? "<br/><br/>Pse e bën këtë fare?<br/><br/>Anvil është një mjet që e bën të thjeshtë ndërtimin e një aplikacioni në internet.Ne e bëjmë këtë duke ju mundësuar të ndërtoni të gjithë aplikacionin në një gjuhë të vetme, Python.<br/><br/>Pritja e thjeshtë e vizitorëve është pjesë e kësaj.<br/><br/>Platforma web është thyer, dhe Anvil është përpjekja jonë për ta rregulluar atë., Dhe, sepse ka kaq shumë kompleksitet në vendosjen e një aplikacioni web, një shërbim cloud-hosted ishte mënyra më e mirë për të siguruar thjeshtësinë që duam. Në këtë mënyrë, ju mund të ndërtoni aplikacionin tuaj në Anvil Editor, dhe ta bëni atë të jetojnë në internet me një klik.<br/><br/>Por ne vazhduam të dëgjojmë nga njerëzit që thanë, "kjo është e madhe, por..."<br/><br/>"...por duhet ta drejtoj këtë në një platformë në det të hapur pa qasje të besueshme në internet"<br/><br/>"...por dua të paketoj aplikacionin tim në një pajisje IoT që shes"<br/><br/>ose thjesht, "...por nëse unë jam duke vënë vezët e mia në këtë shportë, si mund të jetë i sigurt se unë ende mund të drejtuar app tim në kohën dhjetë?"<br/><br/>Një shërbim cloud nuk është zgjidhja e duhur për të gjithë.Nëse duam t'u shërbejmë këtyre përdoruesve, duhet të ketë një mënyrë për ta për të marrë aplikacionet e tyre nga Anvil dhe për t'i drejtuar ato në vend, nën kontrollin e tyre të plotë.<br/><br/>Burimi i Hapur: Shkëmbimi i arratisjes, jo një vend projektori<br/><br/>Ne besojmë në çelset e arratisjes, jo vendet e tundjes.Në konferenca ndonjëherë pyetemi, "A mund ta eksportoj këtë si një aplikacion Flask+JS?" Sigurisht, do të ishte e mundur – ne do të mund të gjeneronim një paketë server, të përpilojmë Python në krah të klientit në Javascript, dhe të ndanim një aplikacion klasik në internet.Por do të kishte pengesa serioze, sepse:<br/><br/>Nuk është një udhëtim i rehatshëm.<br/><br/>Gjenerimi i kodit është një vend elektori. Kodi i gjeneruar është më i mirë se asgjë - të paktën ju mund ta redaktoni atë! Por në momentin që ju redaktoni atë kod, ju humbni të gjitha përfitimet e sistemit që e gjeneron atë. Nëse jeni duke përdorur Anvil për shkak të redaktorit të tij drag-and-drop dhe Python në shfletuesin, pse përdoruesit tanë të hostuar në vend duhet të përdorin vym dhe Javascript?<br/><br/>Pra, ne e bëmë atë në mënyrën e duhur: ne motorin runtime të Anvil me burim të hapur, është i njëjti kod që i shërben aplikacionit tuaj në shërbimin tonë të hostuar, dhe kjo përfaqëson aplikacionin tuaj në të njëjtën mënyrë. Ju mund ta modifikoni kodin tuaj me një redaktues tekstesh, ta ekzekutoni atë, pastaj ta shtyni atë përsëri në IDE-n tonë në internet.Nuk është një vend shtypës: nuk ka tranzicion eksploziv.Është një hap i arratisjes: ju mund të ngjiteni dhe të ngjiteni menjëherë prapa.<br/><br/>Po në lidhje me modelin tonë të biznesit?<br/><br/>Anvil nuk u mendua kurrë të ishte një nga ato sisteme me kod të ulët të ndërmarrjes që ju ngarkojnë 20/mo për çdo person që përdor aplikacionin tuaj.Anvil është një mjet zhvilluesi.Aplikacionet që zhvilloni janë tuajat. Ju mundësoni që t'i ekzekutoni ato në një Raspberry Pi është e ftohtë, por nuk ndryshon modelin tonë të biznesit.<br/><br/>Ne po bëjmë atë që kemi qenë gjithmonë: Ne bëjmë dhe shesim një mjet zhvillimi që e bën atë shumë më të thjeshtë për të ndërtuar aplikacione në internet.Ne ofrojmë hosting për aplikacionet e Anvil.Ne ofrojmë të gjithë platformën e zhvillimit dhe hostimit në vend për klientët e ndërmarrjes. Dhe, sigurisht, ne ofrojmë një plan falas në mënyrë që të gjithë të mund të përdorin Annil për hobi ose qëllime arsimore – ose për të filluar ndërtimin e diçka dhe të shohim se si ajo shkon.<br/><br/>Ne kemi hapur-burimin e Anvil App Server për numrin (relativisht të vogël) të njerëzve që kanë nevojë për të, dhe për të siguruar politikën përfundimtare të sigurimit. Sigurisht, mund të ndërtoni një aplikacion me vikm dhe ta strehoni vetë, pa regjistruar as një llogari me ne (kemi marrë dokumente për t'ju treguar se si!) Por Anvil Editor është mënyra më e lehtë në botë për të ndërtuar një web app, dhe shërbimi ynë pritur është mënyra më e lehtë për të vendosur atë - kështu që ne presim shumica e përdoruesve tanë të vazhdojnë duke bërë. Dhe mund të ndërtoni me besim, duke e ditur që kodi me burim të hapur është aty, nëse keni nevojë për të.<br/><br/>Provoni atë veten<br/><br/>Nëse filozofia jonë e zhvillimit rezonon me ju, pse të mos provoni Anvil veten tuaj? |
