In simple terms, the condition is characterized by: one develops a kidney disease and undergoes a kidney transplant and other diseases associated with acidic concentration in the blood and gout. In theory, the condition will occur even if the genetic change is inherited from one parent and sporadically occurs when there is no family history.<br/><br/>Common names of autosomal dominant interstitial kidney disease<br/><br/>The condition has other names as well namely: medullary cystic kidney disease, although this name is not used as much because most people suffering from this condition do not have medullary cysts. It is also referred to as juvenile hyperuricemic nephropathy. The disease tends to affect people of ages 20 to 50. The latter condition as aforementioned occurs in young children, something, which translate to get it from both parents.<br/>Cystic kidney disease is an inherited condition whereby the cysts in the centre of each kidney gradually lose their ability to function properly. Cysts refer to abnormal blisters of fluid in the kidney. The condition further scares the kidney making unable to concentrate the urine and as a result, producing too much urine. Its symptoms include excessive urination, salt cravings, weakness, confusion, bleeding, fatigue, frequent hiccups, low blood pressure, nausea and vomiting, headaches, pale skin, reduced sensation in the hands, weight loss among many others. Other complications include: anemia, ulcers, loss of bone density, infertility and other heart related problems.<br/>Its analysis incorporates blood tests to check for sodium levels and general kidney functions, urine tests to check the levels of concentration and other imbalances, x rays to check for the size of kidneys that may be altered owing to increased urine concentrations, renal biopsy and genetic testing to verify any genetic changes that might have taken place in due time.<br/>While the disease does not have a cut and dry treatment to it, one may focus on controlling measures, which include intake of fluids and salt to supplement the one lost as the disease progresses into latter stages. This also helps reduce dehydration. Other treatments include taking of prescribed medication and diet changes and minimal intakes of foods containing phosphorous and potassium. Further complications may also require one to have a kidney transplant. Basically, this is not a curable disease but rather a manageable once detected in the early stages.<br/><br/>The common yet different factor of Autosomal dominant interstitial kidney disease<br/><br/>Nephronophthisis and medullary cystic kidney disease are mainly grouped together because, in essence, they share the same features but with a slight difference in regards inheritance patterns to the former affecting children and the latter affecting young adults and older age groups. Similar features for both are ADH resistant urine concentration that leads to polyuria and polydipsia, anemia and renal diseases.<br/>The former aforementioned condition is Autosomal recessive accounting to 15% of chronic diseases and causes ESRD during early childhood while the latter is Autosomal dominant with a few sporadic new mutations and causes ESRD for people between the ages of 30 and 50. | Online CPR Certifikimi Blog<br/><br/>Data: 23 korrik, 2014<br/><br/>Sëmundjet ndërinstitucionale të veshkave ndërinstitucionale janë një koleksion i rrallë sëmundjesh që ndikojnë në funksionet e njohura të veshkës.

| Hobbes' vs. Locke's Account on the State of Nature<br/><br/>Topic: PhilosophyWords: 2539Pages: 9Aug 3rd, 2021<br/><br/>Hobbes and Locke are among the most influential political philosophers to ever write in English. The state of nature, which precedes the organization of the complex societies, is the common premise that both Hobbes and Locke share but interpret in different ways. The former views humans in their natural state as equally dangerous and free to pursue their egoistic goals unrestricted by the nonexistent notions of justice, which is why his natural state amounts to the "war of every man against every man" (Hobbes76). The latter, on the other hand, views humans in their original condition as equally valuable and restricts natural freedom by the idea of justice that requires not to harm others, which allows defining the state of nature as "mutual assistance and preservation" rather than war (Locke 15). The key difference between the two philosophers' accounts of natural state is that Locke uses ethical considerations while Hobbes does not, and it ultimately leads Hobbes to envisage a state exercising unlimited power over human beings, while Locke limits the government by the moral principles, which he considers a natural law.<br/><br/>Hobbes bases his assumptions regarding the state of nature on the fact that all people are roughly equal in their physical and mental capabilities. He admits that some individuals may demonstrate greater physical strength or superior intellect but insists that "when all is reckoned together, the difference between man and man is not so considerable" (Hobbes 74). Since humans are roughly equal in their capabilities, they also have similar hopes to attain their ends and satisfy their needs (Hobbes 75). As a logical outcome of this equality, when the people begin competing for scarce resources, no one may feel entirely secure in his or her possessions. Even if a mighty, cunning, and capable person succeeds in subjugating "the persons of all men he can," it still does not guarantee the ultimate security (Hobbes 75). As no human can obtain such superiority over the others that renders him or her utterly immune to their strength of intellect, no human can feel completely safe when surrounded by his or her equals. Hobbes' equality in the natural state is equality of fear, where all humans view each other as dangerous competitors.<br/><br/>Just as Hobbes, Locke considers all human beings to be fundamentally equal, but assigns a very different meaning to the term. From his perspective, it is not the equality of capabilities, but, rather, the equality of value. He opines that the people "promiscuously born to all the same advantages of nature" should logically enjoy the perfect equality among them, as there is no reason to consider anyone inherently more valuable (Locke 8). The only possible foundation for designating some people as superior to others would be if God "by any manifest declaration of his will, set one above another" (Locke 8). Since such divine sanction of superiority is absent, Locke concludes that the natural equality of all representatives of humankind is not to be called into question. Hobbes approaches equality pragmatically and stresses that people in their natural state are equally dangerous, but Locke employs an ethical approach and emphasizes that humans are equally valuable in God's eyes. This disagreement is but the first difference between the two authors based on the fact that Locke includes God as a premise into his political philosophy, while Hobbes does not.<br/><br/>Another characteristic feature of Hobbes' account of the natural state is his interpretation of liberty. According to Hobbes, the state of nature implies unlimited freedom to do whatever is necessary for one's continued existence. The philosopher defines liberty as "the absence of external impediments" in using one's abilities to attain one's goals (Hobbes 79). The primary purpose of every sentient being is to maintain its continued existence. As a consequence, Hobbesian freedom amounts to the unhindered opportunity to do anything that, in one's judgment, would be best suited to preserve one's life and possessions (Hobbes 79). The only limitation to liberty is that a person cannot do anything contradictory to sustaining his or her life or destroying "the means of preserving the same" (Hobbes 79). Apart from that, there are no boundaries, and everyone has "a right to everything, even to one another's body" if that furthers one's survival (Hobbes 80). Thus, natural liberty, as viewed by Hobbes, is the absence of externally enforced obstacles in pursuing one's right to everything to sustain and secure one's continued existence.<br/><br/>Locke also upholds the idea of natural liberty but, unsurprisingly, approaches it in a manner that is significantly different from that of Hobbes. As soon as he begins discussing liberty in the state of nature, he immediately notes that a state of freedom does not equate "a state of license" (Locke 9). The philosopher identifies two specific limitations to human freedom in the state of nature. The first one is identical to that introduce by Hobbes: however free and independent, a person nevertheless "has not liberty to destroy himself" (Locke 9). Yet the second limitation contradicts Hobbes' prepositions directly. According to Locke, every human being has a natural obligation not to "harm another in his life, health, liberty, or possessions" (9). Just as with his interpretation of equality, the author bases this assertion on ethical and religious grounds: people should preserve each other's existence since they are all creations of the same "omnipotent, and infinitely wise maker" (Locke 9). Thus, Locke's limits liberty in the natural state far more stringently than Hobbes by introducing the obligation to refrain from harming both oneself and the others.<br/><br/>The differences between the two authors also manifest in their accounts of justice in the natural state of humanity. As far as Hobbes is concerned, delineating just and unjust practices is merely the matter of the law. There is no jurisprudence in the state of nature, and the only law governing human beings in their original condition is a natural law that only obliges them to seek personal security. As a result, nothing can be unjust in the original state of the humankind: "notions of right and wrong justice and injustice" have no place and no meaning in the absence of the stringently enforced law (Hobbes 78). As long as the people use their virtually unlimited freedom to ruthlessly compete with each other for resources, to which they are equally entitled, they have no criteria to differentiate between just and unjust actions. Therefore, the Hobbesian state of nature defies the very idea of justice since the author interprets it as a mere function of the formalized and established law.<br/><br/>Locke assigns different meaning to justice and views it not so much in legislative as in the ethical terms. This paper already mentioned that, unlike Hobbes, Locke employs ethical notions and generally bases his political philosophy on moral rather than purely practical presumptions. Locke's natural law, unlike that of Hobbes, obliges human beings to take care of each other rather than simply leaving everyone to fend for themselves. As a result, there is a place for justice and injustice in his state of nature. The author points to this fact himself when noting that no one should deprive another of his or her life of the means of preserving it "unless it be to do justice on an offender" (Locke 9). This statement reveals with the utmost clarity that, according to Locke, there is justice in the state of nature, and, moreover, humans have to preserve it actively. The criterion of justice, which Hobbes' natural state lacks, is the second limitation on natural liberty imposed by Locke: an action is unjust if it constitutes an unwarranted threat to another person's life and possessions.<br/><br/>These differences in the two authors' treatment of equality, liberty, and justice or injustice culminate in their interpretation of the relationship between the state of nature and the state of war. From Hobbes's perspective, the two are synonymous, because the ruthless competition is the only logical outcome of putting people with equivalent capabilities and similar needs in an environment with limited resources. He states this connection outright: "if any two men desire the same thing, which nevertheless they cannot both enjoy, they become enemies" and are, therefore, in the state of war with each other (Hobbes 75). Yet since humans are numerous and all possess similar capabilities and needs, this competition manifests not only in the individual interactions but also on the level of humanity as a whole. As long as all humans have equal and unlimited rights to all resources and even to each other's bodies and lives, the state of nature is a war of "every man against every man" (Hobbes 76). This grim interpretation stems directly from Hobbes' portrayal of the state of nature as governed solely by the individuals' egoistic urges.<br/><br/>Locke, on the other hand, differentiates between the state of nature and the state of war and points out that, while they may occur simultaneously, it is no reason to identify one with the other. Locke's definition of the state of war is virtually identical to that offered by Hobbes. According to Locke, "he who attempts to get another man into his absolute power does thereby put himself into a state of war with him" (14). This explanation lines up perfectly with the Hobbesian notion that everyone's universal right to everything, including the other people's bodies and lives, leads to the state of war. Yet Locke refuses to equate the state of war and the state of nature precisely because he denies Hobbes' interpretation of natural freedom. Since Locke's natural state restrains people from harming each other through the second limitation of liberty, an attempt on another person's freedom is a transgression against the natural law. While for Hobbes, war is the humankind's condition by default, Locke portrays it as a perversion of the state of nature rather than its rule.<br/><br/>These differences in delineating the state on nature and its constituents, such as liberty, equality, justice, and war, pave the way to the authors contrasting portrayals of government. Based on his pessimistic assessment of the state of nature, the author of Leviathan concludes that, under conditions of war, there can be no definite hope for "living out the time which nature ordinarily alloweth men to live" (Hobbes 80). The solution is laying down the universal right to everything and leaving everyone "so much liberty against other men, as he would allow other men against himself" (Hobbes 80). The participants of the resulting social contract invest the unlimited liberties they have surrendered into a sovereign – the bearer of the supreme power whose purpose is to preserve the achieved status quo by punishing all transgressions against it. Sovereign's power is absolute: the ruler has the authority "to do whatsoever he shall think necessary" to promote peace between his subjects so that no one would assail another's life or property (113). Hobbes concludes that without such an unassailable figure entitled with the right to do anything to the subjects, there can be no peace and no guarantee of security.<br/><br/>While Locke agrees with the necessity of creating politically organized societies, he nevertheless opposes Hobbes' idea of the sovereign power as unlimited and unassailable. As mentioned above, Locke's state of nature is not nearly as dreadful as that painted by Hobbes because of the people's obligation to preserve not only themselves but each other as well. Therefore, the need for social contract arises not from the fear of the others, but from the sheer convenience. Small communities may not need numerous laws to solve conflicts and "officers to superintend the process," but larger associations find it advisable to institute governments for that purpose (Locke 57). Yet the power of the government cannot be unlimited because it would result in subduing the subjects to an "inconstant, uncertain, unknown, arbitrary will of another man" (Locke 17). Such a government would constitute a twofold violation of the natural law. By agreeing to another person's absolute power over his life, a subject would violate its first limitation prohibiting to harm oneself. As for the ruler, destroying another person's liberty would constitute direct harm and, as such, be contradictory to the second limitation.<br/><br/>As a direct continuation of his case for unlimited governmental authority, Hobbes denies the separation of powers as a principle. From his perspective, the sovereign, once instituted, possesses "the whole power of prescribing the rules" governing the lives of the subjects or, in shorter terms, the legislative power (Hobbes 114). The sovereign also reserves the right of "hearing and deciding all controversies" – that is, the judicial power (Hobbes 114). Finally, since the entire purpose of the sovereign is to force the subjects to refrain from harming each other, there can be no doubt that executive power is also his or her exclusive prerogative. The separation of powers as a concept is alien to Hobbes because of his views on the state of nature. Creating a political entity where the executive, legislative, and judicial branches would check each other – that is, compete – would mean recreating the Hobbesian state of nature-as-war on a higher level. Since the people enter a social contract and institute a government to put the state of nature behind them, not reinstate it in a different form, the separation of powers contradictory Hobbes' views directly.<br/><br/>Locke, on the other hand, embraces separation of power as a foundational principle of his political theory. His case for the separation is evident in the discussion of the limits of the legislative power. As Locke puts it, it would be hardly advisable "for the same persons, who have the power of making laws, to have also in their hands the power to execute them" (76). The philosopher points to the imperfections of human nature and the inherent desire to "grasp at power" as a rationale for this precautionary measure (Locke 76). Just as in Hobbes' case, Locke's account of the separation of powers stems directly from his interpretation of the state of nature. If there is already justice in the state of nature and the people can understand it, any government is inevitably subject to the same natural law. Since absolute power over people violates both limitations of this law, separating and distributing it is advisable so that the government would function appropriately.<br/><br/>This paper has demonstrated that, while the differences between Hobbes' and Locke's accounts of the natural state of humanity are numerous, they ultimately amount to the presence of absence of moral premises. Hobbes views the natural state as that of unlimited liberty, where people endowed with equal capabilities and not bound by any moral notions, such as justice, compete for the resources unceasingly. Locke, however, interprets equality and liberty ethically rather than practically and opines that war is a perversion of the natural state, as the natural law obliges humans not to harm each other. This disagreement influences the philosophers' approaches to government. Hobbes insists on an all-powerful ruler, as, in the absence of ethical restraints, no other authority could force the humans to refrain from harming each other. Yet, in Locke's view, granting the government unlimited powers would be contradictory to the ethical limitations embedded in the law of nature, which is why he, unlike Hobbes, advocates separation of powers. | Hobbs' vs. Locke's Llogaria në gjendjen e natyrës<br/><br/>Tema: Filozofia Words: 2539Faqet: 9Gu 3rd, 2021<br/><br/>Hobbes dhe Locke janë ndër filozofët politikë më me ndikim për të shkruar ndonjëherë në anglisht. Gjendja e natyrës, e cila i paraprin organizimit të shoqërive komplekse, është premisa e përbashkët që edhe Hobbes dhe Locke ndajnë, por interpretojnë në mënyra të ndryshme. E para i sheh njerëzit në gjendjen e tyre natyrore si po aq të rrezikshme dhe të lira për të ndjekur qëllimet e tyre egoiste të ndaluara nga nocionet inekzistente të drejtësisë, prandaj gjendja e tij natyrore përbën "luftën e çdo njeriu kundër çdo njeriu" (Hobbes76). Kjo e fundit, nga ana tjetër, i sheh njerëzit në gjendjen e tyre origjinale si po aq të vlefshme dhe kufizon lirinë natyrore nga ideja e drejtësisë që kërkon të mos dëmtojë të tjerët, gjë që lejon përcaktimin e gjendjes së natyrës si "ndihmë dhe ruajtje të ndërsjellë" sesa lufta (Locke 15). Dallimi kryesor midis llogarive të dy filozofëve të shtetit natyror është se Locke përdor konsiderata etike ndërsa Hobbes nuk ka, dhe në fund të fundit bën që Hobbes të parashikojë një fuqi shtetërore të pakufizuar mbi qeniet njerëzore, ndërsa Locke kufizon qeverinë nga parimet morale, të cilat ai i konsideron një ligj natyror.<br/><br/>Hobbs i bazon supozimet e tij në lidhje me gjendjen e natyrës në faktin se të gjithë njerëzit janë afërsisht të barabartë në aftësitë e tyre fizike dhe mendore. Ai pranon se disa individë mund të demonstrojnë forcë më të madhe fizike ose intelektin superior, por këmbëngul që "kur të gjithë janë të regjistruar së bashku, ndryshimi midis njeriut dhe njeriut nuk është aq i konsiderueshëm" (Hobbes 74). Meqenëse njerëzit janë afërsisht të barabartë në aftësitë e tyre, ata gjithashtu kanë shpresa të ngjashme për të arritur fundin e tyre dhe për të kënaqur nevojat e tyre (Hobbes 75). Si rezultat logjik i kësaj barazie, kur njerëzit fillojnë të konkurrojnë për burime të pakta, askush nuk mund të ndihet plotësisht i sigurt në pasurinë e tij ose të saj. Edhe nëse një person i fuqishëm, dinak dhe i aftë arrin të nënshtrojë "personat e të gjithë meshkujve që ai mund," ai ende nuk garanton sigurinë përfundimtare (Hobbes 75). Meqenëse asnjë njeri nuk mund të marrë epërsi të tillë mbi të tjerët që e bëjnë atë plotësisht imun ndaj forcës së tyre të intelektit, asnjë njeri nuk mund të ndihet plotësisht i sigurt kur rrethohet nga ai ose ajo është e barabartë me të. Barazia e Hobbes në gjendjen natyrore është barazia e frikës, ku të gjithë njerëzit e shohin njëri-tjetrin si konkurrentë të rrezikshëm.<br/><br/>Ashtu si Hobbs, Locke i konsideron të gjitha qeniet njerëzore të jenë thelbësisht të barabarta, por i cakton një kuptim shumë të ndryshëm termit Nga këndvështrimi i tij, nuk është barazia e aftësive, por, përkundrazi, barazia e vlerës. Ai shprehet se njerëzit "të lindur në mënyrë të pamoralshme nga të gjitha avantazhet e njëjta të natyrës" duhet të gëzojnë logjikisht barazinë e përsosur në mesin e tyre, pasi nuk ka asnjë arsye për të konsideruar askënd në mënyrë të natyrshme më të vlefshme (Lock 8). Baza e vetme e mundshme për caktimin e disa njerëzve si superiore ndaj të tjerëve do të ishte nëse Perëndia "me ndonjë deklaratë manifestuese të vullnetit të tij, të vendosur mbi njëri-tjetrin" (Locke 8). Meqenëse një sanksion i tillë hyjnor i superioritetit mungon, Locke arrin në përfundimin se barazia natyrore e të gjithë përfaqësuesve të njerëzimit nuk kërkohet në pyetje. Hobbes i afrohet barazisë pragmatike dhe thekson se njerëzit në gjendjen e tyre natyrore janë po aq të rrezikshëm, por Locke punëson një qasje etike dhe thekson se njerëzit janë po aq të vlefshëm në sytë e Perëndisë. Kjo mosmarrëveshje është vetëm ndryshimi i parë midis dy autorëve bazuar në faktin se Locke përfshin Perëndinë si një premisë në filozofinë e tij politike, ndërsa Hobbes jo.<br/><br/>Një tjetër tipar karakteristik i llogarisë së Hobbes për gjendjen natyrore është interpretimi i tij i lirisë.Sipas Hobbes, gjendja e natyrës nënkupton liri të pakufizuar për të bërë gjithçka që është e nevojshme për ekzistencën e vazhdueshme të dikujt. Filozofi e përkufizon lirinë si "mungesa e pengesave të jashtme" në përdorimin e aftësive për të arritur qëllimet e dikujt (Hobbes 79).Qëllimi kryesor i çdo njeriu është të ruajë ekzistencën e tij të vazhdueshme. Si pasojë, liria Hobbesiane përbën mundësinë e papenguar për të bërë gjithçka që, në gjykimin e dikujt, do të ishte më së miri e përshtatshme për të ruajtur jetën dhe pasuritë e dikujt (Hobbes 79). Kufizimi i vetëm i lirisë është se një person nuk mund të bëjë asgjë kontradiktore me ruajtjen e jetës së tij ose të saj ose shkatërrimin e "mjetit të ruajtjes së së njëjtë" (Hobbes 79). Përveç kësaj, nuk ka kufij dhe të gjithë kanë "një të drejtë për gjithçka, madje edhe për trupin e njëri-tjetrit" nëse kjo vazhdon mbijetesën (Hobbes 80). Kështu, liria natyrore, siç shihet nga Hobbes, është mungesa e pengesave të zbatuara nga jashtë për të ndjekur të drejtën e dikujt për të mbështetur dhe siguruar ekzistencën e vazhdueshme të dikujt.<br/><br/>Locke gjithashtu mban idenë e lirisë natyrore, por, çuditërisht, i afrohet në një mënyrë që është dukshëm e ndryshme nga ajo e Hobbes. Sapo fillon të diskutojë lirinë në gjendjen e natyrës, ai menjëherë vë në dukje se një gjendje lirie nuk barazon "një gjendje licence" (Locke 9).Filori identifikon dy kufizime specifike për lirinë njerëzore në gjendjen e natyrës. E para është identike me atë hyrje nga Hobbes: megjithatë i lirë dhe i pavarur, një person megjithatë "nuk ka liri për të shkatërruar veten" (Locke 9). Megjithatë kufizimi i dytë kundërshton drejtpërdrejt propozimet e Hobbes. Sipas Locke, çdo qenie njerëzore ka një detyrim natyror që të mos "dëmtojë një tjetër në jetën e tij, shëndetin, lirinë ose pronësinë" (9). Ashtu si me interpretimin e tij të barazisë, autori e bazon këtë pohim mbi baza etike dhe fetare: njerëzit duhet të ruajnë ekzistencën e njëri-tjetrit, meqë janë të gjitha krijime të të njëjtit krijues "të gjithëfuqishëm, dhe pafundësisht të mençur" (Blloku 9). Kështu, liria e kufizimit të Locke-it në shtetin natyror shumë më saktë se Hobbes duke futur detyrimin për të mos dëmtuar si veten ashtu edhe të tjerët.<br/><br/>Dallimi midis dy autorëve gjithashtu shfaqet në llogaritë e tyre të drejtësisë në gjendjen natyrore të njerëzimit.Për sa i përket Hobbes, përcaktimi i praktikave të drejta dhe të padrejta është thjesht çështje e ligjit. Nuk ka jurisprudencë në gjendjen e natyrës, dhe i vetmi ligj që rregullon qeniet njerëzore në gjendjen e tyre fillestare është një ligj natyror që i detyron vetëm të kërkojnë siguri personale. Si rezultat, asgjë nuk mund të jetë e padrejtë në gjendjen origjinale të njerëzimit: " nocionet e drejtësisë dhe të padrejtësisë" nuk kanë vend dhe nuk kanë kuptim në mungesë të ligjit të zbatuar në mënyrë strikte (Hobbes 78). Për sa kohë që njerëzit përdorin lirinë e tyre praktikisht të pakufizuar për të konkurruar pa mëshirë me njëri-tjetrin për burime, për të cilat kanë të drejtë njëlloj, ata nuk kanë asnjë kriter për të dalluar midis veprimeve të drejta dhe të padrejta. Prandaj, gjendja e natyrës Hobbesiane sfidon vetë idenë e drejtësisë pasi autori e interpreton atë si një funksion të thjeshtë të ligjit të formalizuar dhe të vendosur.<br/><br/>Kyçeja i jep kuptim të ndryshëm drejtësisë dhe e sheh jo aq shumë në legjislacion si në aspektin etik. Ky dokument tashmë përmendi se, ndryshe nga Hobbes, Locke përdor nocione etike dhe në përgjithësi bazohet në filozofinë e tij politike mbi supozime morale dhe jo thjesht praktike. Ligji natyror i Locke-it, ndryshe nga ai i Hobbes, detyron qeniet njerëzore të kujdesen për njëri-tjetrin në vend që thjesht të largohen të gjithë për t'u mbrojtur për veten e tyre., Si rezultat, ka një vend për drejtësi dhe drejtësi në gjendjen e tij të natyrës. Autori e tregon vetë këtë fakt kur tha se askush nuk duhet ta privojë një tjetër nga jeta e tij ose e saj e mjeteve të ruajtjes së tij "përveç nëse nuk është për të bërë drejtësi për një shkelës" (Locke 9). Kjo deklaratë zbulon me qartësinë më të madhe se, sipas Locke, ka drejtësi në gjendjen e natyrës, dhe, për më tepër, njerëzit duhet ta ruajnë atë në mënyrë aktive. Kritika e drejtësisë, të cilat i mungon shteti natyror i Hobbs, është kufizimi i dytë për lirinë natyrore të vendosur nga Locke: një veprim është i padrejtë nëse përbën një kërcënim të pajustifikuar për jetën dhe pasuritë e një personi tjetër.<br/><br/>Këto dallime në trajtimin e barazisë, lirisë dhe drejtësisë, ose në interpretimin e tyre të marrëdhënieve midis gjendjes së natyrës dhe shtetit të luftës. Nga këndvështrimi i Hobbes, të dy janë sinonim, sepse konkurrenca e pamëshirshme është rezultati i vetëm logjik i vënies së njerëzve me aftësi ekuivalente dhe nevoja të ngjashme në një mjedis me burime të kufizuara. Ai thotë se kjo lidhje ka të drejtë: "nëse çdo dy burra dëshirojnë të njëjtën gjë, e cila megjithatë ata nuk mund të gëzojnë të dy, ata bëhen armiq" dhe janë, në gjendjen e luftës me njëri-tjetrin (Hobbes 75). Megjithatë, duke qenë se njerëzit janë të shumtë dhe kanë të gjitha aftësi dhe nevoja të ngjashme, ky konkurs manifestohet jo vetëm në bashkëveprimet individuale, por edhe në nivelin e njerëzimit në tërësi. Për sa kohë që të gjithë njerëzit kanë të drejta të barabarta dhe të pakufizuara për të gjitha burimet dhe madje edhe për trupat dhe jetën e njëri-tjetrit, gjendja e natyrës është një luftë e "çdo njeriu kundër çdo njeriu" (Hobbes 76). Ky interpretim i zymtë buron drejtpërdrejt nga portretizimi i gjendjes së natyrës së Hobbes siç qeverisen vetëm nga dëshirat egoiste të individëve.<br/><br/>Kyçe, nga ana tjetër, dallon gjendjen e natyrës dhe gjendjen e luftës dhe thekson se, ndërsa ato mund të ndodhin njëkohësisht, nuk është arsye që të identifikohet njëra me tjetrën. Përkufizimi i Locke-t për gjendjen e luftës është praktikisht identik me atë që ofrohet nga Hobbes., Sipas Locke, "ai që përpiqet të hyjë në një tjetër njeri në pushtetin e tij absolut e vë veten në një gjendje lufte me të" (14). Ky shpjegim përputhet në mënyrë të përkryer me nocionin Hobbesian se e drejta universale e të gjithëve për gjithçka, duke përfshirë trupat dhe jetën e njerëzve të tjerë, çon në gjendjen e luftës. Megjithatë Locke refuzon të barazojë gjendjen e luftës dhe gjendjen e natyrës pikërisht sepse mohon interpretimin e lirisë natyrore të Hobbes. Meqenëse shteti natyror i Locke i frenon njerëzit të dëmtojnë njëri-tjetrin përmes kufizimit të dytë të lirisë, një përpjekje për lirinë e një personi tjetër është shkelje kundër ligjit natyror. Ndërsa për Hobbes, lufta është gjendja e njerëzimit si parazgjedhje, Locke e portretizon atë si një perversion të gjendjes së natyrës dhe jo të sundimit të saj.<br/><br/>Këto dallime në përcaktimin e shtetit për natyrën dhe përbërjet e tij, të tilla si liria, barazia, drejtësia dhe lufta, i hapin rrugën autorëve që i kanë të bëjnë me portretizimin e qeverisë. Bazuar në vlerësimin pesimist të gjendjes së natyrës, autori i Levitan konkludon se, në kushtet e luftës, nuk mund të ketë shpresë të caktuar për "të jetuarit në kohën që natyra i lejon njerëzit të jetojnë" (Hobbes 80). Zgjidhja është të përcakton të drejtën universale për çdo gjë dhe të largohet nga të gjithë "aq shumë liri kundër njerëzve të tjerë, pasi ai do të lejojë njerëzit e tjerë kundër vetes" (Hobbes 80). Pjesëmarrësit e kontratës sociale që rezulton investojnë liritë e pakufizuara që kanë dorëzuar në një sovran – mbajtësi i fuqisë supreme, qëllimi i së cilës është ruajtja e status quo-së së arritur duke ndëshkuar të gjitha shkeljet ndaj saj. Fuqia e Sovranit është absolute: sundimtari ka autoritetin "të bëjë çfarë do të mendojë e nevojshme" për të promovuar paqen midis subjekteve të tij, në mënyrë që askush të mos e shmangë jetën ose pronën e tjetrit (113). Hobbes konkludon se pa një figurë të tillë të papërdorshme të titulluar nga e drejta për të bërë asgjë për subjektet, nuk mund të ketë paqe dhe garanci sigurie.<br/><br/>Ndërsa Locke pajtohet me domosdoshmërinë e krijimit të shoqërive të organizuara politikisht, ai megjithatë kundërshton idenë e Hobbes për fuqinë sovrane si të pakufizuar dhe të papërdorshëm. Siç u përmend më lart, gjendja e natyrës së Locke nuk është aq e tmerrshme sa ajo e pikturuar nga Hobbes për shkak të detyrimit të njerëzve për të ruajtur jo vetëm veten e tyre, por edhe njëri-tjetrin. Prandaj, nevoja për kontratë sociale lind jo nga frika e të tjerëve, por nga lehtësia e plotë. Komunitetet e vogla mund të mos kenë nevojë për ligje të shumta për të zgjidhur konfliktet dhe "oficerët për të superpërfunduar procesin", por shoqatat më të mëdha e kanë më të këshillueshme që të instituojnë qeveritë për këtë qëllim (Locke 57). Megjithatë, fuqia e qeverisë nuk mund të jetë e pakufizuar sepse ajo do të rezultojë në nënshtrimin e subjekteve në një "vullnet të pandërprera, të pasigurt, të panjohur, arbitrare të një njeriu tjetër" (Blloku 17). Një qeveri e tillë do të përbënte një shkelje të dyfishtë të ligjit natyror. Duke rënë dakord për fuqinë absolute të një personi tjetër mbi jetën e tij, një subjekt do të shkelte detyrimin e parë për të dëmtuar veten. Sa i përket sundimtarit, shkatërrimi i lirisë së një personi tjetër do të përbënte dëm të drejtpërdrejtë dhe, si të tillë, do të ishte kontradiktore me kufizimin e dytë.<br/><br/>Si vazhdim i drejtpërdrejtë i rastit të tij për autoritetin e pakufizuar qeveritar, Hobbes mohon ndarjen e pushteteve si parim. Nga këndvështrimi i tij, sovrani, i themeluar dikur, posedon "të gjithë fuqinë e përshkrimit të rregullave" që rregullojnë jetën e subjekteve ose, në terma më të shkurtër, pushtetin legjislativ (Hobbes 114). Sovrani gjithashtu rezervon të drejtën e "të dëgjuarit dhe të vendimit të të gjitha deformimeve" - domethënë, të fuqisë gjyqësore (Hobbes 114). Së fundi, duke qenë se i gjithë qëllimi i sovranit është t’i detyrojë subjektet të përmbahen nga dëmtimi i njëri-tjetrit, nuk mund të ketë dyshim se pushteti ekzekutiv është gjithashtu prerogativë e tij ose e saj ekskluzive. Ndarja e pushteteve si një koncept është i huaj për Hobbes për shkak të pikëpamjeve të tij mbi gjendjen e natyrës. Krijimi i një subjekti politik ku degët ekzekutive, legjislative dhe gjyqësore do të kontrollonin njëra-tjetrën – kjo është, konkurruese – do të nënkuptonte rikrijimin e gjendjes së natyrës-si-luftës në një nivel më të lartë. Meqenëse populli hyn në një kontratë sociale dhe vendos një qeveri për ta vënë pas saj gjendjen e natyrës, duke mos e restauruar në një formë tjetër, ndarja e pushteteve që bien ndesh me shikimet e Hobbes direkt.<br/><br/>Kyçe, nga ana tjetër, përqafon ndarjen e pushtetit si një parim themelor i teorisë së tij politike.Çështja e tij për ndarjen është e dukshme në diskutimin e kufijve të pushtetit legjislativ. Siç thotë Locke, vështirë se do të këshillohet "për të njëjtat persona, të cilët kanë fuqinë e të bëjnë ligje, të kenë edhe në duart e tyre fuqinë për t'i ekzekutuar" (76). Filozofi tregon për papërsosmëritë e natyrës njerëzore dhe dëshirën e natyrshme për të "kulur në pushtet" si racional për këtë masë parandaluese (Locke 76). Ashtu si në rastin e Hobbes, tregimi i Locke-it për ndarjen e fuqive buron direkt nga interpretimi i tij i gjendjes së natyrës. Nëse ka tashmë drejtësi në gjendjen e natyrës dhe njerëzit mund ta kuptojnë atë, çdo qeveri në mënyrë të pashmangshme i nënshtrohet të njëjtit ligj natyror. Meqenëse pushteti absolut mbi njerëzit shkel të dy kufizimet e këtij ligji, ndarja dhe shpërndarja e tij këshillohet që qeveria të funksionojë siç duhet.<br/><br/>Ky dokument ka demonstruar se, ndërsa ndryshimet midis llogarive të Hobbes dhe Locke të shtetit natyror të njerëzimit janë të shumta, ato përfundimisht përbëjnë praninë e mungesës së ambienteve morale. Hobbs e konsideron gjendjen natyrore si atë të lirisë së pakufizuar, ku njerëzit e pajisur me aftësi të barabarta dhe jo të lidhur nga ndonjë nocion moral, siç është drejtësia, konkurrojnë për burimet pa pushim. Kyçe, megjithatë, interpreton barazinë dhe lirinë në mënyrë etike sesa praktikisht dhe hapet që lufta është një perversion i shtetit natyror, pasi ligji natyror e detyron njerëzit të mos e dëmtojnë njëri-tjetrin. Kjo mosmarrëveshje ndikon në qasjen e filozofëve ndaj qeverisë.Hobbes këmbëngul në një sundimtar të gjithë-fuqishëm, pasi, në mungesë të kufizimeve etike, asnjë autoritet tjetër nuk mund t'i detyrojë njerëzit të përmbahen nga dëmtimi i njëri-tjetrit. Megjithatë, në këndvështrimin e Locke-it, dhënia e fuqive të pakufizuara qeveritare do të ishte kontradiktore me kufizimet etike të ngulitura në ligjin e natyrës, prandaj ai, ndryshe nga Hobbes, mbron ndarjen e pushteteve. |
| Fashion Police: What Game of Thrones threw up<br/><br/>Canadian-French singer Abbas Hasan put blinding effort to outshine all of humanity at Fashion Parade 2014. Nothing wrong with that, except safety is priority and the musician is a health hazard here.<br/><br/>We get he wants to be a star. Sadly, he didn't get the memo where they tell the desperate and the infamous that stardom is a metaphor. You don't have to look like one and literally set our sight ablaze. Also, the All Pakistan Aunty Association has officially lodged a complaint against him. The local market has run dry of fake crystals and sequined monstrosities. They have nothing to wear to their biweekly high teas and they claim he is to blame. Apparently, the outfit is inspired by Game of Thrones. Can he please stick to composing sad songs about his neighbour's dead dog instead of conceptualising outfits? Or maybe it's the trauma of losing the dog, whose death he is clearly not over as he is still wearing its carcass.<br/><br/>The charge sheet Outfit<br/><br/>No one can decide where the outfit begins and where Abbas ends. You stare in fascination, sinking into a deep abyss and wonder why he is wearing leather pants. Whose horse did he kill to steal the saddle draped across his shoulders? Was he in prison right before his red carpet appearance and forgot to take off the chains? How will he survive the synthetic leather and post-sequin rash that is bound to be lethal in such high dosage? Why am I still alive?<br/><br/>Idea<br/><br/>His inspiration was seemingly Game of Thrones, but he eventually ended up looking like he was thrown out of a Viking restaurant. Had he come across any of the characters from the show, he would've been slain in the first five seconds of the first episode.<br/><br/>The mental health or lack thereof: Someone get him to a counsellor ASAP! He seems to be under the assumption that wearing a dead dog means that the only friend he had in his life is still alive. Dear Abbas:<br/><br/>1. Denial is not a river in Egypt<br/><br/>2. Your tortured psyche is not helping your music, so get help<br/><br/>3. Try imaginary friends<br/><br/>Bail out!<br/><br/>All of us at the Fashion Police headquarters are severely traumatised. Abbas is someone we did not enjoy arresting. He is currently in custody and attempting revenge by putting on attires from other fantasy shows. He just glitter glued himself in order to look like Edward Cullen from Twilight. As a public service message and to prevent further nervous breakdowns, we gave him the following examples of men from the red carpet of the same event.<br/><br/>Zohaib Hassan<br/><br/>When in doubt, play it safe. The singer looks like your average uncle at a shaadi. A plain black suit with no accessories, even if it's a tad disproportionate, is workable. Zohaib's look is blended into everything and nothing, and when you don't have a fashion sense or the money to hire a stylist, this is okay. It does not carry the risk of cardiac arrest for fellow attendees at an event. Given Abbas' delicate mental condition, this look is what he should aim for. Always and forever.<br/><br/>Ali Zafar<br/><br/>One day, after decades of therapy, Abbas could aspire to wear attire like Ali Zafar's. The dapper summer look is done to near perfection. Ali came really close to looking like a maître d at a French restaurant with his white summer jacket with black lapels, but the shirt saves it, never mind the satin. His pants would have been ridiculous had they not been folded at the ankles. The shoes are what hipster chic happy endings are made of. | Policia e Modës: Çfarë Loja e Shtretër hodhi lart<br/><br/>Këngëtari kanadez-francez Abbas Hasan bëri përpjekje të verbër për të tejkaluar të gjithë njerëzimin në Parada e Modës 2014.

| Determining soil hydraulic properties with different wetting liquids : A thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the Degree of Master of Science at Lincoln University<br/><br/>Abstract<br/><br/>Soil hydraulic properties such as hydraulic conductivity, water retention and plant water relationships dominate the water movement processes. For example, the infiltration, evaporation and water flow within the soil. As a widespread phenomenon in soil, soil water repellency alters the soil hydraulic functions by resisting the water flow into the soils. Moreover, the hydraulic properties not only depend on the pore system of soil but also are affected by the physicochemical properties of the pore surfaces. Compared to water, ethanol is not affected by the water repellency due to its lower surface tension. The purpose of using ethanol is to eliminate the effect of soil water repellency on hydraulic properties measurements. However, applying pure ethanol into natural soil can degrade the soil organic materials and lead to changes in physical properties. Therefore, the aqueous ethanol solutions can be an alternative option. Nevertheless, the feasibility of using aqueous ethanol for determining soil liquid retention curve remains unknown. This study aims to test the feasibility of the aqueous ethanol solutions (0, 10 %, 20 %, 30 %, 40 %, 50 % and 100 % v/v) for establishing liquid retention curve under a small range of applied pressure in coarse sand samples with different wettability and organic amended natural soil (Templeton silt loam (TSL) with mushroom compost, biochar, dairy effluent, and municipal compost, the application rate was 15 % by weight). The result showed that the desorption of testing aqueous ethanol solutions compared to water was quicker by approximately 1 to 3x based on the liquid content at the same applied pressure and the time for reaching each equilibrium. The outcomes from the sand experiment suggested that when the concentration of aqueous ethanol solution was below 50 %, the losses via evaporation were less than 1% and the relative differences between testing liquid and water was lower than 10 %. However, the evaporation losses were 11.06 % and 24.6 %, and the relative differences were all around 15 % and 30 % in 50 % and 100 % ethanol solution, respectively. In contrast, the organic amendments in Templeton silt loam not only increased the water retention capability but also reduced the evaporation losses. The evaporation losses in TSL soil and TSL with organic amendments soil were with 1 % in solutions with less than 50 % ethanol content. Evaporation losses of 50 % and 100 % ethanol were 2.8 % and 2.9 %, respectively. The relative differences between water and testing liquid were similar to the sand experiment when the testing liquid concentrations were below 50 %. However, the relative differences in 50 % and 100 % ethanol solution were smaller than in the sand sample with around 10 % and 15%, respectively. Additionally, the analysis of relative difference suggested that almost all aqueous ethanol solutions had lower volumetric liquid content at the same supplied pressure compared to water, which was a reflection of the aqueous ethanol solutions desorbed faster than water under equivalent pressure. Therefore, 10 % to 40 % of ethanol solutions could be considered an alternative for determining soil hydraulic properties due to their faster desorption rate and not being affected by soil water repellency. Due to the evaporation and dissolution of organic material, aqueous ethanol solutions above 50% concentration were not suitable for coarse sand or medium-textured soil....

Si një fenomen i përhapur në tokë, uji i tokës ndryshon funksionet hidraulike të tokës duke rezistuar rrjedhjen e ujit në dhe. Për më tepër, vetitë hidraulike jo vetëm që varen nga sistemi porues i tokës, por gjithashtu ndikohen nga vetitë fiziologjike të sipërfaqeve të poreve.Krahasuar me ujin, etanoli nuk ndikohet nga repelenca e ujit për shkak të tensionit të ulët sipërfaqësor. Qëllimi i përdorimit të etanolit është të eleminojë efektin e rimbushjes së ujit në vetitë hidraulike.Megjithatë, aplikimi i etanolit të pastër në tokë mund të degradojë materialet organike të tokës dhe të çojë në ndryshime të vetive fizike. Prandaj, zgjidhjet ujore të etanolit mund të jenë një opsion alternativ, megjithatë, fizibiliteti i përdorimit të etanolit ujor për përcaktimin e kurbës së mbajtjes së lëngjeve të tokës mbetet i panjohur. Ky studim synon të testojë fizibilitetin e zgjidhjeve ujore të etanolit (0, 10%, 30%, 40%, 50% dhe 100 % v / v) për vendosjen e kurbës së lëngshme të mbajtjes nën një gamë të vogël të presionit të aplikuar në mostrat e rërës së trashë me lagështueshmëri të ndryshme dhe tokë organike të ndryshuar natyrore (TSL) me përbërje kërpudhash, biokar, përbërës të qumështit, dhe përbërje komunale, norma e aplikimit ishte 15 % nga pesha). Rezultati tregoi se shkatërrimi i zgjidhjeve ujore të etanolit krahasuar me ujin ishte më i shpejtë nga 1 në 3x bazuar në përmbajtjen e lëngshme në të njëjtën presion të aplikuar dhe kohën për të arritur çdo ekuilibër. Rezultatet nga eksperimenti me rërë sugjerojnë se kur përqendrimi i zgjidhjes ujore etanol ishte nën 50%, humbjet nëpërmjet avullimit ishin më pak se 1% dhe dallimet relative midis testimit të lëngshme dhe ujit ishte më e ulët se 10%. Megjithatë, humbjet e avullimit ishin 11,06 % dhe 24,6 %, dhe dallimet relative ishin rreth 15% dhe 30% në 50% dhe 100% të zgjidhjeve të etanolit, respektivisht. Në të kundërt, ndryshimet organike në grumbullimin e qetësisë së Tempullit jo vetëm që rrisin aftësinë e mbajtjes së ujit, por edhe ulin humbjet e avullimit. Humbjet e avullimit në tokën TSL dhe TSL me ndryshime organike ishin me 1% në zgjidhje me më pak se 50% të përmbajtjes së etanolit. Humbjet e avullimit 50% dhe 100 % të etanolit ishin përkatësisht 2.9% dhe 2.9%.
