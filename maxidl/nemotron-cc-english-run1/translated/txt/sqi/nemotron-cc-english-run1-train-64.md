| Smith Chuck - Through the Bible C2000 SeriesShall we turn to the book of Acts, chapter one, as we begin our study of the early church.<br/>Luke, the author of the book of Acts, a companion of Paul the apostle, who was author also of the Gospel According to Luke, wrote these two treatises to a friend, Theophilus. Theophilus is a Greek name. It's a name that has a beautiful meaning. The name means lover of God. There are some who believe that it was not a man at all, but that the gospel and the book of Acts were addressed to the lovers of God, whoever you may be. There are other traditions that say that Theophilus was actually Luke's master. That in those days physicians were slaves, usually the slave of a wealthy patron. So that Luke's master was Theophilus, and he released Luke to be with Paul on the missionary journeys. Thus, Luke is writing back to his former master. This is an early tradition of the church, but it is, of course, impossible to prove, like so many of the traditions.<br/>There are also those who believe that when Paul was in Troas and he received a vision of a man calling unto him saying, "Come over to Macedonia and help us," that that man in Paul's vision was none other than Luke. For the first one that Paul really met when he came to Macedonia was Luke. And as we are in the book of Acts, you will find that when we get to that portion of the book of Acts, Luke begins to write more in the first person rather than the third person. So it is, evidently, at this particular point in the Acts of the Apostles that Luke became a companion of Paul and began to journey with him. He began to use the pronouns "we" and "us" instead of "they" and "them." This is, no doubt, where Luke became a participant and an eyewitness of those things that were happening from this point on. We will bring this out to you when we get to that point.<br/>He begins the Acts of the Apostles by tying it with the Gospel According to Luke. It is interesting that the very last thing that Luke records in his gospel is the very first thing he records in the Acts of the Apostles. We find the gospel of Luke closing as Jesus is telling His disciples to wait in Jerusalem until they be endued with power from on high. And then Jesus ascended up into heaven, and so he closes the gospel. In opening the Acts of the Apostles, he writes,<br/>The former treatise [that is, the Gospel According to Luke,] have I written unto you, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and teach ( Act 1:1 ),<br/>The key word is began. The Gospel According to Luke is not the full story of the ministry of Jesus Christ. It is only the beginning of the ministry of Jesus Christ. Jesus continues to minister to the needs of people. Jesus continues to heal the sick. Jesus continues to raise the dead. Jesus continues to minister His love and His gospel to the world, only now He is ministering through those disciples who have been anointed with His Holy Spirit. But the ministry of Christ is continuing; basically, is the premise that Luke takes in the Acts of the Apostles. The former treatise of all that Jesus began, both to do and to teach.<br/>Now because of that, the Acts of the Apostles is an unfinished book: in that the Lord today continues to work through the lives of those who have dedicated themselves to be the instruments of God. To be led and guided and anointed by His Holy Spirit, to continue the ministry of Jesus in the world today. Now God has ordained that His work should be accomplished through human instruments. I do not say that it must be accomplished. God can use angelic beings for His work, and there will come a time, during the book of Revelation when God will use angels to proclaim His gospel to people all over the world. Revelation, chapter 14, "The first angel flying through the midst of heaven having the everlasting gospel" ( Rev 14:6 ). But at the present time, God has chosen to use human instruments. As imperfect as they may be, yet that's what God has ordained to use. The exciting thing about that is, God will use me and God will use you. So many times, we're begging off, "O Lord, I can't speak. I've never been able to speak before or even now, Lord." As Moses tried to beg off the call of God. Jeremiah said, "Lord, I'm just a kid; no one's going to listen to me." And we all have our excuses why we can't be used. Don't we? We all know the reasons why God couldn't use us.<br/>One time, as the Lord was calling a prophet to do His work, he said, "Lord, send whoever you want." The Lord said, "Hey, I've called you." "Lord, good idea; send whoever you want." So often we're in that position, "Lord, send by the hand of whomsoever you will, anybody but me Lord." And yet, God has ordained to use us.<br/>Now, each of us can show our own imperfections. Each of us can point out our own inabilities, and all of us can find an excuse why God wouldn't want to use me. But yet, God has chosen to use you. That through your life He might reveal Himself to a needy world. You wonder when God has such instruments to use how He ever got the job done, don't you?<br/>Until the day in which he was taken up, after that he through the Holy Spirit had given commandments to the apostles whom he had chosen ( Act 1:2 ):<br/>That is what he ended the Gospel of Luke with. The day that Jesus was taken up, after He had told the apostles to wait for the endowment of power.<br/>To whom he also [that is the apostles he also] showed himself alive to them after his passion [or death] by many infallible proofs ( Act 1:3 ),<br/>It is difficult to deny the fact of the resurrection of Jesus Christ. I was amused, as well as annoyed and irritated, by an article I read in the Santa Ana Register this last Saturday. Of the creation science and evolutionary theories being presented in the county schools. How that, this one professor said that he teaches a science class, and thus, they deal only in facts, and that they don't have any place for theories. Because science is based upon fact and creation is based upon religious superstitions. It takes a lot of faith to believe the religious theories. When you are dealing with facts, you can just accept them. I thought, "Very interesting in that science class, they taught me it was a fact that the world was four billion years old. Now today they are teaching it's a fact that the world is twelve billion years old. And it wasn't that long ago that I went to school."<br/>It's interesting that the Bible has never needed to be revised or updated to meet the current data that men have discovered. And yet, if you would take my high school science textbooks today and try to teach a science class from them, you would find that many of the things that were taught as scientific fact when I was in high school are no longer recognized as scientific fact. The simple cell protoplasm is no longer a simple cell, but extremely complex. If there is any fact that can be attested to in history it is the fact of the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.<br/>We have a jurisprudence system that is based upon the testimony of witnesses. If a man is accused of a crime and there are people who witnessed that crime while it was being committed, and they are brought to the standard, and they swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help them God. And in their questioning they affirm that, "I saw that man in the bank on May twenty-third. I saw him pull out a gun from his coat. I heard him demand that all of the money be given to him. I saw him as he left the bank. I saw him as the officer apprehended him outside." And if you can get three or four witnesses to point to that man and will keep their testimony under cross-examination, that man is judged to be guilty. He is the one who did it. We have two or three witnesses that are testifying the same story about that man, and it is accepted as fact that he is the one who perpetrated the crime and is guilty. You've got witnesses who have sworn to tell the truth that are verifying.<br/>After the death of Jesus, when He rose again, He appeared unto many different people who gave sworn testimony that they saw Him. That they talked to Him, that He appeared to them in various places under different circumstances. And for a period of forty days was visiting with them. And at one time, up to as many as five hundred people who were gathered at one place, He appeared. It's difficult to just cast aside or deny the witness of these people. To do so is to discredit our whole jurisprudence system. But not only that, these men who testified that they saw the risen Lord, that they talked to Him, that they ate with Him, they, all of them, with the exception of one, met violent deaths at the hands of other people because of their affirming that the story they told was true. You talk about witnesses sworn to tell the truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth. If a person's life was threatened because of that witness, and it was a lie, at least one them would've broken under the pressure. They would've confessed to the entire hoax. "He showed Himself alive after His passion by many infallible proofs."<br/>being seen of them for forty days, speaking to them of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God ( Act 1:3 ):<br/>Sometimes we fault the disciples because of their questions of the timing of the kingdom of God. Let it be remembered that the kingdom of God was the favorite subject of Jesus Christ. He was always talking about the kingdom of God, and it is a great hope that He was planting into the hearts of all men. Things are not always going to continue corrupted as they are. The world is not going to go forever under the power of darkness, under the bondage of evil. God is going to one day establish His kingdom upon the earth. A kingdom of righteous joy and peace. "Jesus shall reign, where ere the sun doth her successive journeys run. And His kingdom will extend from shore to shore." And that day will be the most glorious day the world has ever seen, as sickness and suffering and pain will be abolished in His kingdom. As sin and greed and these things that have made the world such an intolerable place will be abolished in His kingdom. The godless commercialism, the exploitation of man, all of these things abolished in His glorious kingdom when He reigns. No wonder the disciples were anxious to get it on. I'm anxious to get it on; I'm anxious for His kingdom to come. And Jesus told us when we pray, the first petition is, "Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven" ( Mat 6:10 ). This is the right kind of a desire that we should all have. I desire the kingdom of God. And so He was talking to them, during this forty-day period, of the kingdom.<br/>And, being assembled together with them, he commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which, saith he, you have heard of me ( Act 1:4 ).<br/>He said, "Now look, wait here in Jerusalem until you receive the promise of the Father." This promise that He is referring to is, no doubt, the promise in Joel where the Lord promised, "And it shall come to pass in the later days, saith the Lord, that I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and daughters will prophesy, and your young men shall dream dreams, your old men shall see visions: and upon my servants and my handmaidens shall I pour out my Spirit, saith the Lord" ( Joe 2:28-29 ). The promise of the Father: the day is going to come when God is going to pour out His Spirit upon all flesh, all of the believers. They will, each one, receive that dynamic from God.<br/>For John [He said,] truly baptized with water; but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now ( Act 1:5 ).<br/>The idea of baptism was that of emersion, the bapteedzo. John baptized with water, submerged the people in water, "you're going to be submerged in the Holy Spirit in not many days."<br/>Now when they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, will you at this time restore the kingdom to Israel? ( Act 1:6 )<br/>"When is it going to be, Lord? When's the time for this restoration?" And Jesus is talking to them now, not about the kingdom, but about the power that they're going to receive for service. And so He brushes aside their question.<br/>Saying unto them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father has put in his own power ( Act 1:7 ).<br/>"It's not for you to know." They lived constantly in the anticipation of the immediate setting up of the kingdom. During the entire lifetime of Jesus, they were expecting Him at any moment to go into the phone booth and come out as the savior of the world. Shazzam! Showing His power and overthrowing the governments of the world, establishing God's kingdom upon the earth. And they were waiting daily for this change to transpire. And whenever Jesus would talk about going to Jerusalem, being turned over into the hands of sinful man, and then being crucified, "Oh, oh no, Lord. No, no you don't understand the kingdom, Lord. Be that far from Thee." When Jesus died on the cross, they were all greatly disappointed.<br/>The two disciples on the road to Emmaus, so sad. "Hey, fellows. How come you're so sad as your walking along?" "What do you mean? You must be a stranger around here if you don't know the things that have been happening lately in Jerusalem." "What things?" "Oh, a fellow by the name of Jesus of Nazareth...oh man, it was mighty and powerful. The anointing of God was upon His life. We had hoped that in Him was the deliverance of Israel, but they crucified Him. We had hoped . . . now it's dead." Now He's risen, and He's saying, "In a few days, fellows, you're going to receive the promise of the Father." "Oh, what promise? The promise of the establishing of the kingdom?" You see, it was legitimate that they should ask. "Is this it Lord? Alright! Is this the time? Are you going to set up your kingdom now?" "No. It's not for you to know those times that the Father's appointed or that the Father has in His own power. But, you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you."<br/>Now here, the Greek preposition epi is used to signify a new relationship that they were to have with the Holy Spirit. In the Gospel According to John, chapter 14, as Jesus is there promising to send the Holy Spirit, He said, "I will not leave you comfortless. I will come to you, and I will pray the Father, and He will send to you another comforter, even the Spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth Him not neither knows Him, but you know Him for He dwells with you, and He shall be in you" ( Joh 14:17-18 ). Same Greek preposition as ours, only they spell it "en" instead of "in." Two-fold relationship there in John: He is with you, but He's going to be dwelling in you. But now Jesus said you're going to receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you. The Greek preposition epi, which is translated in different texts throughout the New Testament as "upon" or "over" or I like it, "overflows."<br/>In the seventh chapter of the gospel of John: "On the last day, the great day of the feast when Jesus stood there on the Temple Mount and cried to the people, 'If any man thirst let him come unto Me and drink: and he who drinks of the water that I give, out of his innermost being there will gush torrents of living water.'" John said, "This spake He of the Spirit, which was not yet given which they who believe on Him should receive" ( Joh 7:37-39 ). What did He speak of the Spirit? That it would be like a torrent of living water flowing out. I like, "When the Spirit overflows you," upon you, or over you, or overflows from you. So the three-fold relationship: He is with you prior to your conversion, He is the one who causes you to realize that you are a sinner, He is the one who points to Jesus Christ as the answer as He convinces the world of sin, of righteous, and of judgment. The moment you open your life and heart to Jesus Christ and invite Him to come in, the Holy Spirit comes and begins to indwell you. He shall be in you. "Know ye not that you are not your own, you have been bought with a price, therefore glorify God in your body and your spirit which are His. And know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit which is in you? Be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess, but be filled, or be ye being filled with the Spirit" ( 1Co 6:19-20 ,Eph 5:18 ). But now here's a third relationship. This is an empowering experience.<br/>You will receive [the dunamus] the dynamics, when the Holy Spirit has come [epi] upon you [or over you, or when there is that overflow from you]: and ye shall be witnesses unto me ( Act 1:8 )<br/>And so the dynamic, to be a witness for Jesus Christ. It is interesting that the word witness in Greek is the word martus from where we get our word martyr. And in Greek it does mean martyr. A witness is one who not only proclaims what he believes, he lives what he believes, he is what he believes, and he believes it so strongly, that if necessary, he'll die for what he believes. That's how strong is his belief. He's a martus. You can't stop him. He's not afraid to die for what he believes.<br/>You remember when Paul was on his way back to Jerusalem and Agabus came down from Caesarea and he took Paul's girdle and tied himself up and he said, "So is the man who owns this girdle to be bound when he gets to Jerusalem." And Paul's friends began to weep, saying, "Oh, Paul, don't go, don't go." And he said, "What do you mean by these tears? Do you think you're going to dissuade me? Do you think I'm worried about being bound? I'm ready to die." He was a martus. "I'm ready to die." Being put to death for your faith did not make you a martyr; because you were a martyr, you were put to death. Because you were a witness, because you believed it so strong. So, it did not make you a witness, it only proved what you were. You were a witness all along. If you hadn't been a martus, you would've never gone to your death. You would've recanted; you would've said, "Whoa, whoa, wait, wait. Hold on, let's change course here. I think that I may have made a mistake." Then you say, "Well, he wasn't a martus. Stealing a horse doesn't make you a horse thief; it only proves that you were. No one steals a horse unless he's a horse thief. So, stealing it doesn't make you a horse thief, it only proves that you were all along. Being martyred only proves what you were a witness, a martus. "And you will be witnesses." And isn't it interesting that most of them were martyred? "Witnesses unto Me."<br/>The witness was to be both in Jerusalem, and in all of Judea ( Act 1:8 ),<br/>The witness began right at home. The hardest place, isn't it? It's to start right at home in Jerusalem, and then the area around Jerusalem, the area of Judea. And then it was to spread up into Samaria. And then it was to go out into the uttermost parts of the world. And as we study the book of Acts, we will see this very progression. How the witness began in Jerusalem. We'll get that in the next chapter. And then we'll see how it began to spread through out Judea. And then Phillip went up into Samaria, and then finally Paul and Barnabas are called to go into the uttermost parts of the world. And so the witness spread through the anointing and the empowering of the Holy Spirit.<br/>Now when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight ( Act 1:9 ).<br/>This is the final promise made by Jesus to His disciples. This is it, the final words prior to His ascension. Of course, later He came and talked to Paul and others, but prior to His ascension, this is His final word. And upon this, when He had spoken these things, while they were watching Him, He was taken up and a cloud received Him out of their sight.<br/>And while they were looking steadfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, there were two men who stood by them in white apparel ( Act 1:10 );<br/>We assume they were angels.<br/>Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as you have seen him go into heaven ( Act 1:11 ).<br/>They saw Him as He ascended up into heaven and they will behold Him when He comes again. "Behold the Lord cometh with ten thousands of His saints, to execute judgement upon the earth" (Jud 1:14-15). And then, "Unto Him who loved us and gave Himself for us and who has made us unto our God, kings and priests who shall reign with Him upon the earth, behold the Lord cometh, and every eye shall see Him, and they also who pierced Him shall mourn" Rev 1:5-7 ). So the Lord's coming. Every eye shall see Him. The Jehovah Witnesses say that He is already come, but it was a secret coming. As it was only the disciples that saw Him go, it was only the disciples, of the Jehovah Witnesses, who saw Him return. But Jesus said, "If they say unto you, 'He has come in secret and has gone into a secret chamber don't believe it'" ( Mat 24:26 ). So you have to choose, to believe Jesus or them.<br/>"This same Jesus which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as you've seen Him go into heaven."<br/>Now there's a very interesting verse in II John, verse Act 1:7 , "For many deceivers are entered into the world who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh." That, unfortunately, is a poor translation of the Greek. For this participle is in the present tense and should be translated "is coming in the flesh." Those who would deny that Jesus Christ is coming in the flesh. What does John say of them? "They are a deceiver and an antichrist. Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward. For whosoever transgresses and abides not in the doctrine of Christ, has not God. He that abides in the doctrine of Christ, he has both the Father and the Son. And if there come any unto your door (on Saturday morning) and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, and neither bid him good-bye. For he that bids him good-bye is a partaker of his evil deeds" (2Jn 1:7-11). Ask them one question, "Is Jesus coming in the flesh?" Just ask them that question. And if they say no, just remember what John warned you and what John told you. "If any confess not that Jesus Christ is coming in the flesh." Do you remember when He was with the disciples and He said, "Give me something to eat"? He said, "You know, spirits don't eat; touch me. See? It's me." So, this same Jesus is coming again in the same manner in which they saw Him go into heaven. And I, for one, believe that that coming is very soon.<br/>Then retuned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a Sabbath's day journey [about two-thirds of a mile]. And when they were come in, they went up into an upper room, where there abode both Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, and Phillip, and Thomas, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon Zelotes, and Judas the brother of James. And these all continued in one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers ( Act 1:12-14 ).<br/>This is the last mention of Mary the mother of Jesus. At this point and from this point on, there is no further mention of her in the Acts of the Apostles or in the epistles. No mention of her death or of her miraculous ascension into heaven, without death. Nothing is mentioned in the scripture. It is silent.<br/>His brethren would be a reference probably to James and to Jude and to those other brothers who were sons of Joseph and Mary.<br/>The upper room--there are some who say that it is the same upper room in which Jesus had the Last Supper with His disciples. And yet, there are others who hold to this upper room being a room in the temple precincts where the early church met. Take your choice.<br/>And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples, and said, (the number of their names together were about one hundred and twenty,) men and brethren, this Scripture must needs have been fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit by the mouth of David spake before concerning Judas, which was a guide to those who took Jesus ( Act 1:15-16 ).<br/>Here again, Peter still his same impetuous self. They're waiting in prayer and supplication, and Peter stands up and says, "Fellows, there's a scripture that's gotta be fulfilled." And you know he's going to move ahead, "Let's get the program going; let's cast lots and find out who's going to take Judas' place." I do feel that Peter was again in the flesh, manifesting that impetuous nature that was his. And I think that the future history of the church in the book of Acts points this out. I am interested in Peter's understanding of the scriptures, how that he is quoting from so many places in the Old Testament. Peter does manifest a very great understanding of the Old Testament scriptures which is a point in his favor.<br/>Notice that Peter ascribes to the Holy Spirit those things that David wrote. So that, "All scripture is given by inspiration of God" ( 2Ti 3:16 ). Not part of the scriptures. Because, if you tell me that part of the scriptures are given by inspiration of God, then I must ask you, "What parts are by inspiration and what parts are not by inspiration?" And then you are then the authority who tells me what part I can believe and what part I can't believe. And the minute that God is no longer the authority but you're the authority, I'm in trouble. Beware of those who say, "Well, you can't believe all of the scriptures." The scriptures themselves say, "All scripture is given by inspiration of God." And here, Luke in writing of what Peter was saying, declares that David was actually the spokesman for the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit, by the mouth of David, spake concerning Judas.<br/>For he was numbered with us, [he was one of the twelve] he had obtained a part of this ministry. But now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity; and falling headlong ( Act 1:17-18 ),<br/>He purchased the field, the potter's field as Zachariah the eleventh chapter declares.<br/>and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all of his bowels gushed out ( Act 1:18 ).<br/>There are those who find a discrepancy in the scriptures, because in one of the gospels we are told that when Judas came back and tried to return the money, and they said, "Hey, it's your problem. We can't take it." And put it back in the temple treasury. "It's blood money." Then he threw it there on the floor of the temple and he went out and hung himself. Here Peter tells us that he fell headlong and just popped. And there are those who imagine a discrepancy. Very simple, he went up into the tree to hang himself, tied the rope around his neck and tied it to the limb and jumped. And the force of the fall either snapped the rope or his head, and he fell on down into the canyon and just as he said it here.<br/>It was known to all of the dwellers at Jerusalem; insomuch that the field is called in their tongue, Aceldama, that is to say, The field of blood. For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be desolate, and let no man dwell therein: and, His bishoprick let another take ( Act 1:19-20 ).<br/>Now in reality he's quoting from two different Psalms here. From Psa 69:25 ,he puts it together with Psa 109:8 . And putting the two together he finds these prophecies concerning Judas.<br/>Wherefore of these men ( Act 1:21 )<br/>Now here is where they are looking for someone to take Judas' place to be an apostle. Here are the qualifications they looked for in that time.<br/>Wherefore of these men which have companied with us all the time that the Lord Jesus when in and out among us ( Act 1:21 ),<br/>Now you remember there were many disciples, many disciples of which Jesus chose ten to be apostles. And the word apostle means "one who is sent out." Or chose twelve to be apostles, so He sent out the twelve. The number of human government. "We only have eleven. We need one to take Judas' place, but we need one who has been with us all the while from the beginning with Jesus."<br/>From the time he was baptized by John, until the day he was taken up from us, must one be ordained to be a witness [of what?] of His resurrection ( Act 1:22 ).<br/>So these were the requirements they were looking for. Someone who had been around the whole while. From the time of John's baptism to the ascension. And one who saw the risen Lord, and thus could bear fact of the resurrection, their testimony to the fact.<br/>Now Paul the apostle, later in asserting the fact that he was an apostle said, "Have I not seen the risen Christ?" Evidently that was one of the requirements of apostleship. Someone asked me, "Are there apostles today?" Well, I don't know. I don't think that there are in the same sense that they were in the New Testament. Surely there is none today who can bear witness to the resurrection as they did.<br/>They appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias. And they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord, which knowest the hearts of all men, show whether of these two that you have chosen ( Act 1:23-24 ),<br/>I think that we often make this mistake of giving the Lord two choices, both wrong. Limiting God, you see. We're so prone to do this. Obviously, Paul was God's choice. Peter was impetuous, and jumping the gun said, "Hey, we've got to do something, you know, gotta help God out. You know, one's missing and we've got to fill him in." And yet, "God, which one of these two do you want?" And giving God the two choices.<br/>That he may take part of this ministry and this apostleship, from which Judas by the transgression fell, that he might go to his own place. And so they gave forth their lots ( Act 1:25-26 );<br/>An interesting way by which they sought to determine the will of God. Let's throw dice, find out what God's will is here. It's interesting to me, the various ways that people have devised to discern the will of God. Now, in the Old Testament times they had an interesting way of coming to the priest, who would inquire of the Lord for them through the Urim and the Thummim, the "lights and perfections." Just what these Urim and Thummim were, we don't know. I'm sure they were not the colored glasses that Joseph Smith found with the Golden Tablets; the magic glasses, that when you put them on, you could suddenly read the hieroglyphic writing.<br/>There are those who say that the Urim and Thummim were actually a black and a white stone that was worn in a pouch on the chest of the priest. They would pray and ask the Lord a particular question. You remember that David was asking the Lord definite questions: "Lord, shall we go out against the Philistines?" The answer was, "No." So again, the next day, "Lord, shall we go out against the Philistines?" The answer was, "Yes." "When shall we go?" They would ask specific questions, and the Lord would direct them through the Urim and the Thummin. They say that the priest would pray, seek God, and then reach in and pull out one of the two stones. If it was the white stone, it was a yes answer. If it was a no, then it would be the black stone that he would pull out. Some even say we get the term blackballed from this Urim and Thummim. Actually, back in the original it is a no vote against a particular project or idea. Just what the Urim and Thummim were, we don't know. But during the Old Testament period, they did use a method of casting lots to determine the will of God.<br/>So here the disciples are picking up on the same thing as they are throwing the dice to see which of the two fellows that God had chosen to replace Judas Iscariot.<br/>the lot fell on Matthias; he was numbered with the eleven ( Act 1:26 ).<br/>Now who in the world is Matthias? No one ever heard of him before or since. It'll be interesting to meet Matthias and find out who he is and what he did. I think from the subsequent history, it's obvious to assume that God chose Paul as an apostle. Paul declares it himself. Now this is the last time we ever read of them seeking to discern the will of God by the casting of lots or by a chance kind of a thing.<br/>I know a fellow today, in seeking to discern the will of the Lord, will pray and ask the Lord a question. He'll have ten pennies in his pocket, and as he's praying, he'll take the pennies with his eyes closed and put them down on the table, and if they all come up heads, it's a yes. An interesting thing, every once in a while, they'll all come up heads, and that's pretty good odds. Yet, we don't find any pattern for this after the Holy Spirit was given. Once the Holy Spirit came upon the church, then the Holy Spirit began to speak to them and direct them. And the Holy Spirit said, "Separate unto me Paul and Barnabas for the ministry where I have called them" ( Act 13:2 ). And the Holy Spirit sent them forth. So we find the church more directly guided by the Holy Spirit. Once the Holy Spirit came, this throwing dice to find out the will of God was set aside.<br/>"<br/><br/>King James Version<br/><br/>This is the 1769 King James Version of the Holy Bible (also known as the Authorized Version). "Public Domain" | Smith Chuck - Përmes Biblës C2000 SeriesShall ne kthehemi në librin e Akteve, kapitulli i parë, si ne fillojmë studimin tonë të kishës së hershme.<br/>Luka, autor i librit të Veprave të Apostujve, një shok i apostullit Pavël, i cili ishte edhe autor i Ungjillit Sipas Lukës, i shkroi këto dy traktate një miku, Teofilia është një emër grek që ka një kuptim të bukur. Emri do të thotë dashnor i Perëndisë, ka disa që besojnë se ai nuk ishte aspak një njeri, por se ungjilli dhe libri i Veprave u trajtuan të dashurve të Perëndisë, kushdo që ju mund të jeni. Ka edhe tradita të tjera që thonë se Teofil ishte mjeshtër i Lukës, që në ato ditë mjekët ishin skllevër, zakonisht rob i një mbrojtësi të pasur. Kështu që mjeshtri i Lukës, ishte Teofil, dhe ai e liroi Lukan për të qenë me Palin në udhëtimet misionare. Kështu, Luka po i rikthehet ish zotërisë së tij. Kjo është një traditë e hershme e kishës, por kjo është, natyrisht, e pamundur për të provuar, si kaq shumë nga traditat.<br/>Ka edhe nga ata që besojnë se kur Pali ishte në Troas dhe ai mori një vizion të një njeriu duke i thënë: “Eja në Maqedoni dhe na ndihmo”, se ai njeri në vizionin e Palit nuk ishte tjetër veç Lluka. Për të parën që Pali u takua me të vërtetë kur erdhi në Maqedoni ishte Luka, dhe si ne jemi në librin e Veprave, do të zbuloni se kur të arrijmë në atë pjesë të librit të Veprave, Luka fillon të shkruajë më shumë në vetën e parë sesa personi i tretë. Pra, është e qartë, në këtë pikë të veçantë në Veprat e Apostujve se Luka u bë shok i Palit dhe filloi të udhëtojë me të. Ai filloi të përdorë përemrat "ne" dhe "ne" në vend të "ata" dhe "ata". Kjo është, pa dyshim, ku Luka u bë pjesëmarrëse dhe dëshmitare okulare e atyre gjërave që po ndodhnin nga kjo pikë, ne do t’jua sjellim këtë, kur të arrijmë në atë pikë.<br/>Ai fillon Veprat e Apostujve duke e lidhur atë me Ungjillin sipas Lukës, është interesant fakti që gjëja e fundit që Luka regjistron në ungjillin e tij është gjëja e parë që regjistron në Veprat e Apostujve. Ne e gjejmë ungjillin e Lukës teksa Jezui u thotë dishepujve të Tij të presin në Jerusalem, derisa të mbarohen me fuqi nga lart; pastaj Jezusi u ngjit në qiell dhe ai e mbylli ungjillin, në hapjen e Veprave të Apostujve, shkruan ai.<br/>Unë ju shkrova, o Teofil, nga të gjitha ato që Jezusi nisi të bëjë dhe të mësojë (Veprat 1:1),<br/>Ungjilli sipas Lukës nuk është historia e plotë e shërbesës së Jezu Krishtit, por fillimi i shërbesës së Jezu Krishtit. Jezusi vazhdon t’u shërbejë nevojave të njerëzve. Jezusi vazhdon të shërojë të sëmurët. Jezui vazhdon t’i ngjallë të vdekurit, Jezui vazhdon t’i shërbejë dashurisë së tij dhe ungjillit të tij ndaj botës, vetëm tani Ai po ndihmon nëpërmjet atyre dishepujve që janë të vajosur me Frymën e Tij të Shenjtë. Por ministria e Krishtit është e vazhdueshme; në thelb, është premisa që Luka merr në Veprat e Apostujve. Ish-trajtimi i gjithçkaje që Jezusi filloi, si për të bërë ashtu edhe për të mësuar.<br/>Për shkak të kësaj, Veprat e Apostujve janë një libër i papërfunduar: në atë që Zoti sot vazhdon të punojë nëpërmjet jetës së atyre që e kanë përkushtuar veten e tyre për të qenë instrumentet e Perëndisë. Për t’u udhëhequr, drejtuar dhe vajtuar nga Fryma e Tij e Shenjtë, për të vazhduar shërbesën e Jezusit në botë sot.Tani Zoti ka caktuar që puna e Tij duhet të realizohet nëpërmjet instrumenteve njerëzore.Nuk them se ajo duhet të realizohet. Zoti mund të përdorë qeniet engjëllore për veprën e Tij, dhe do të vijë një kohë, gjatë librit të Zbulesës, kur Perëndia do të përdorë engjëjt për t’ua shpallur ungjillin e tij njerëzve në të gjithë botën. Zbulesë, kapitulli 14, “Engjëlli i parë që fluturon në mes të qiellit, duke patur ungjillin e përjetshëm” (Zbul 14:6).Por në kohën e tanishme, Perëndia ka zgjedhur të përdorë instrumente njerëzore.Ashtu siç janë të papërsosur, por kjo është ajo që Perëndia ka caktuar për t’u përdorur. Gjëja emocionuese në lidhje me këtë është, Perëndia do të përdorë mua dhe Perëndia do të të përdorë. Aq shumë herë, ne po lypim: "O Zot, nuk mund të flas, kurrë nuk kam qenë në gjendje të flas para apo edhe tani, Zot." Jeremia tha, "Zot, unë jam thjesht një fëmijë; askush nuk do të më dëgjojë". Dhe ne të gjithë kemi justifikimet tona pse ne nuk mund të përdorim. A nuk e dimë ne të gjitha arsyet pse Perëndia nuk mund të na përdorë.<br/>Një herë, ashtu si Zoti thirri një profet për të bërë veprën e tij, ai tha: "Zot, dërgo cilindo që të duash". Zoti tha: "O Zot, unë të thirra!". Shpesh ndodhemi në atë pozitë: “O Zot, dërgo nga dora e atij që dëshiron, përveç meje Zot!” Po Perëndia ka caktuar të na përdorë.<br/>Tani, secili prej nesh mund të tregojë papërsosmëritë tona. Secili nga ne mund të vërë në dukje paaftësitë tona dhe ne të gjithë mund të gjejmë një justifikim pse Perëndia nuk do të donte të më përdorte.Por megjithatë, Perëndia ka zgjedhur për t’ju përdorur. Ajo nëpërmjet jetës suaj Ai mund të zbulojë veten në një botë nevojtare. Ju pyes veten kur Perëndia ka instrumente të tilla për të përdorur se si Ai u bë ndonjëherë punë, apo jo ju?<br/>Deri në ditën në të cilën ai u mor, pasi me anë të Frymës së Shenjtë u kishte dhënë urdhërime apostujve që ai kishte zgjedhur (Veprat 1:2):<br/>Kjo është ajo me të cilën ai i dha fund Ungjillit të Lukës dhe atë ditë që Jezusi ishte zënë, pasi u kishte thënë apostujve të prisnin dhënien e pushtetit.<br/>Të cilëve edhe ai u është treguar i gjallë atyre pas pasionit të tij, ose vdekjes, nga shumë prova të pandryshueshme (Veprat 1:3),<br/>Është e vështirë të mohosh faktin e ringjalljes së Jezu Krishtit.U prita, si dhe u bezdisa dhe irritova, nga një artikull që lexova në Regjistrin e Santa Ana të shtunën e kaluar. Nga hartimi i teorive shkencore dhe evolucionare që paraqiten në shkollat e qarkut, si tha kjo një profesor i vetëm se mëson një klasë shkencore, dhe kështu ata merren vetëm në fakte, dhe se ata nuk kanë vend për teori. Për shkak se shkenca bazohet në fakte dhe krijim bazohet në stereotipet fetare, duhet shumë besim për t’u besuar teorive fetare.Kur keni të bëni me fakte, thjesht mund t’i pranoni ato. Mendova: “Shumë interesant në atë klasë shkencore, më mësuan se bota ishte katër miliardë vjeçe. Sot po mësojnë se bota është dymbëdhjetë miliardë vjeçe. Dhe nuk ishte aq kohë më parë që shkova në shkollë."<br/>Është interesante që Bibla nuk ka pasur kurrë nevojë të rishikohet apo të përditësohet për të përmbushur të dhënat aktuale që burrat kanë zbuluar. E megjithatë, nëse do të merrni tekstet e mia të shkollave të mesme sot dhe do të përpiqeni të mësonit një klasë shkencore prej tyre, do të zbulonit se shumë nga gjërat që më mësuana si fakt shkencor kur isha në shkollë të mesme nuk njihen më si fakt shkencor. Protoplasma e thjeshtë qelizore nuk është më një qelizë e thjeshtë, por jashtëzakonisht komplekse.Nëse ka ndonjë fakt që mund të vërtetohet në histori është fakti i ringjalljes së Jezu Krishtit nga të vdekurit.<br/>Kemi një sistem jurisprudencë që bazohet në dëshminë e dëshmitarëve. Në qoftë se dikush akuzohet për një krim dhe ka njerëz që e kanë dëshmuar këtë krim ndërsa ishte duke u kryer, dhe ata sillen në standard dhe betohen për të vërtetën, gjithë të vërtetën dhe asgjë tjetër, pra, të mos i ndihmojnë ata. Dhe në pyetjen e tyre ata pohojnë se, “unë e pashë atë njeri në bankë që ishte më njëzet e tre maj dhe e pashë atë të nxirrte një armë nga veshja e tij; dëgjova që i kërkonte të gjitha paratë t’i jepeshin; e pashë ashtu siç e la bankën. E pashë ashtu siç e nxori nga jashtë oficeri.” Dhe nëse mund të marrësh tre ose katër dëshmitarë për të treguar atë njeri dhe do ta mbash dëshminë e tyre nën kontroll, ai njeriu gjykohet të jetë fajtor. Ai është ai që e bëri. Kemi dy ose tre dëshmitarë që po dëshmojnë të njëjtën histori rreth këtij njeriu dhe pranohet si fakti që ai është ai që kreu krimin dhe është fajtor.Ju jeni dëshmitarë që jeni betuar të thoni të vërtetën që po verifikoni.<br/>Pas vdekjes së Jezusit, kur ai u ringjall, Ai iu shfaq shumë njerëzve të ndryshëm që i dhanë dëshmi se e panë Atë, se ata folën me të, dhe iu shfaq atyre në vende të ndryshme në rrethana të ndryshme. Dhe për dyzet ditë ishte për vizitë me ta, dhe në një kohë të vetme, deri në pesëqind njerëz që ishin mbledhur në një vend, Ai u shfaq i vështirë për të hedhur mënjanë ose për të mohuar dëshminë e këtyre njerëzve. Për ta bërë këtë është të diskreditojmë të gjithë sistemin tonë të jurisprudencës. Por jo vetëm kaq, këta njerëz që dëshmuan se e panë Zotin e ngritur, i folën atij, se ata hëngrën bashkë me të, ata të gjithë, me përjashtim të njërit, takuan vdekje të dhunshme në duart e njerëzve të tjerë, për shkak të afirmimit të tyre se rrëfimi ishte i vërtetë. Ti flet për dëshmitarët e betuar për të thënë të vërtetën, e gjithë e vërteta, asgjë përveç së vërtetës.Nëse jeta e një personi kërcënohej për shkak të asaj dëshmie, dhe ishte një gënjeshtër, të paktën njëri prej tyre do të ishte thyer nën presion. Ata (idhujtarët) do t’i rrëfenin të gjithë alakut, “Ai e tregoi veten gjallë pas pasioneve të Tij me shumë prova të papërballueshme.”<br/>duke u parë prej tyre për dyzet ditë, duke u folur atyre për gjërat që kanë të bëjnë me mbretërinë e Perëndisë (Veprat 1:3):<br/>Ndonjëherë ne i shtrojmë dishepujt për shkak të pyetjeve të tyre për kohën e mbretërisë së Perëndisë; le të kujtohet se mbretëria e Perëndisë ishte tema e preferuar e Jezu Krishtit. Ai gjithmonë ishte duke folur për mbretërinë e Perëndisë, dhe kjo është një shpresë e madhe se Ai ishte mbjellë në zemrat e të gjithë njerëzve.Gjërat nuk do të vazhdojnë të korruptuar si ata janë. Bota nuk do të shkojë përgjithmonë nën pushtetin e errësirës, nën skllavërinë e së keqes, dhe Perëndia do të vendosë në një ditë mbretërinë e tij mbi tokë. Jezusi do të mbretërojë, ku do të jetë dielli i tij i mbarë dhe mbretëria e tij do të shtrihet nga bregu deri në breg. Dhe ajo ditë do të jetë dita më e lavdishme që bota ka parë ndonjëherë, ashtu si sëmundjet dhe vuajtjet dhe dhimbjet do të shfuqizohen në mbretërinë e Tij, ashtu si mëkati dhe lakmia dhe këto gjëra që e kanë bërë botën një vend të tillë të patolerueshëm do të shfuqizohet në mbretërinë e Tij. Reklama pa perëndi, shfrytëzimi i njeriut, të gjitha këto gjëra të shfuqizuara në mbretërinë e Tij të lavdishme kur mbretëron Ai, pa dyshim që dishepujt ishin të shqetësuar për të marrë atë.Unë jam i shqetësuar për të marrë atë në të, unë jam i shqetësuar për mbretërinë e Tij që do të vijnë. Jezui na tha kur të lutemi, peticioni i parë është: «Mbretëria jote do të vijë dhe do të bëhet në tokë, ashtu siç është në qiell.» (Mat 6:10).Ky është forma e duhur e dëshirës që duhet të kemi të gjithë dhe dua mbretërinë e Perëndisë. Dhe ai po u fliste atyre kështu, gjatë kësaj periudhe dyzetore të mbretërisë.<br/>Dhe, duke u gjendur bashkë me ta, urdhëroi ata që të mos largoheshin nga Jeruzalemi, por të prisnin premtimin e Atit: ''Që, tha ai, e keni dëgjuar nga unë (Veprat 1:4).<br/>Ai u përgjigj: “Ja, prit në Jeruzalem deri sa të marrësh premtimin e Atit”. Këtë premtim se ai po i referohet është, pa dyshim premtimit në Joel, ku Zoti ka premtuar: "Dhe në ditët e fundit do të ndodhë, thotë Zoti, që unë do të përhap Frymën time mbi çdo mish; dhe bijtë tuaj dhe bijat tuaja do të profetizojnë, të rinjtë tuaj do të shohin vegime. Mbi shërbëtorët dhe shërbëtoret e mia do të derdh Frymën time" (Joe 2:28-29). Premtimi i Atit: dita do të vijë kur Perëndia të hapë Frymën e tij mbi çdo mish, të gjithë besimtarët, secili prej tyre do ta marrë atë dinamikë nga Perëndia.<br/>Sepse Gjoni tha, me të vërtetë pagëzoi me ujë, por ju do të pagëzoheni me Frymën e Shenjtë, mbas jo shumë ditësh (Vepra 1:5).<br/>Ideja e pagëzimit ishte ajo e esmerimit, pagëzimi i pagëzuar nga Gjoni me ujë të pagëzuar, i zhyti njerëzit në ujë, "ju do të zhyteni në Frymën e Shenjtë në jo shumë ditë."<br/>Kur ata u mblodhën, e pyetën: “Zot, a do ta rivendosësh në këtë kohë mbretërinë e Izraelit?” (Veprat 1:6)<br/>Kur do të jetë Zoti, kur është koha për këtë restaurim? Dhe Jezusi po u flet atyre tani, jo për mbretërinë, por për fuqinë që ata do të marrin për shërbim; dhe kështu Ai do të lajqet mënjanë pyetjen e tyre.<br/>Duke u thënë atyre: “Nuk ju takon juve të njihni kohët ose stinët që Ati ka vënë me fuqinë e tij (Veprat 1:7).<br/>Ata jetonin vazhdimisht në pritje të vendosjes së menjëhershme të mbretërisë. Gjatë gjithë jetës së Jezusit, ata prisnin në çdo moment që të shkonin në kabinën e telefonit dhe të dilnin si shpëtimtari i botës. Ta tregojë fuqinë e Tij dhe t’i përmbysë qeveritë e botës, duke e vendosur mbretërinë e Perëndisë në tokë dhe po prisnin çdo ditë që ky ndryshim të zhvillohej. Dhe kur Jezusi fliste për të shkuar në Jeruzalem, duke u kthyer në duart e një njeriu mëkatar, dhe duke qenë i kryqëzuar, "Oh, jo, Zot, jo, ti nuk e kupton mbretërinë, o Zot, sepse mos u largo nga Ti. Kur Jezusi vdiq në kryq, të gjithë u zhgënjyen shumë.<br/>Të dy dishepujt në rrugën për në Emaus, pra i trishtuar, "Hej, shokët, si të vijnë, aq trishtohesh si ecja jote? "Çfarë do të thotë, ti duhet të jesh një i huaj këtu nëse nuk i di gjërat që kanë ndodhur kohët e fundit në Jerusalem." Oh, njeri i fuqishëm dhe i fuqishëm nga emri Jezus Nazaretas, që ishte vajosja e Perëndisë për jetën e tij, me shpresë se tek Ai ishte çlirimi i Izraelit, por ata e kryqëzuan atë, sepse ne kishim shpresuar. Tani Ai u ringjall dhe Ai po thotë: "Në pak ditë, shokë do të marrësh premtimin e Atit. "Oh, çfarë premtim? Premtimi i mbretërisë ishte legjitim që ata të pyesnin, "A është kjo Zoti? A është tani koha? A do të ngresh mbretërinë tënde?" "Jo, nuk është për ty të dish ato kohë që ka caktuar Ati në fuqinë e tij, por ti do të marrësh fuqi kur Fryma e Shenjtë të vijë mbi ty."<br/>Tani këtu, epi i parafjalës greke përdoret për të treguar një marrëdhënie të re që ata do të kishin me Frymën e Shenjtë. Në Ungjillin sipas Gjonit, kapitulli 14, pasi Jezusi është atje duke premtuar të dërgojë Frymën e Shenjtë, Ai tha, "Unë nuk do t'ju lë pa ngushëllim. Unë do të vij te ti dhe do t’i lutem Atit dhe ai do t’ju dërgojë një tjetër ngushëllues, madje Shpirtin e së Vërtetës, të cilin bota nuk mund ta marrë sepse nuk e sheh Atë, por ju e njihni Atë për Ai banon me ju; dhe Ai do të jetë në ju" (Gjoni 14:17-18). I njëjti prezion grek si i yni, vetëm ata e quajnë atë "en" në vend të "në" lidhjen dy-fishore atje në Gjoni: Ai është me ju, por Ai do të banojë në ju. Por tani Jezusi tha se ju do të merrni fuqi kur Fryma e Shenjtë të vijë mbi ju. Epi prepozimi grek, i cili është përkthyer në tekste të ndryshme në të gjithë Dhiatën e Re si "mbi" ose "mbi" ose më pëlqen, "fluvatet e tepërta".<br/>Në kapitullin e shtatë të ungjillit të Gjonit: “Ditën e fundit, ditën e madhe të festës kur Jezui qëndroi atje në malin e tempullit dhe i thirri popullit: “Nëse dikush e ka etje, le të vijë tek unë e të pijë; dhe ai që pi nga uji që jap, me qenë se ka rrëke për të jetuar.” Gjoni tha, "Kjo e tha Ai nga Fryma, i cili nuk u dha ende që ata që besojnë në të duhet të marrin" (Gjoni 7:37-39). Çfarë tha Ai për Frymën, që të jetë si një rrëke uji i gjallë që rrjedh jashtë. Më pëlqen: “Kur Shpirti të përmbytë ty, ose mbi ty, ose të përmbytë nga ti, Pra marrëdhënia tre herë më parë: Ai është me ju përpara konvertimit tuaj, Ai është ai që ju bën të kuptoni se ju jeni një mëkatar, Ai është ai që i tregon Jezu Krishtit si përgjigje që Ai bind botën e mëkatit, të së drejtës dhe të gjykimit. Në momentin që hapni jetën dhe zemrën tuaj për Jezu Krishtin dhe e fton Atë të hyjë, Fryma e Shenjtë vjen dhe fillon t’ju vendosë; ai do të jetë në ju. A nuk e dini se nuk jeni tuaji, ju jeni blerë me një çmim, prandaj përlëvdoni Perëndinë në trupin tuaj dhe në shpirtin tuaj që është Ai, dhe a nuk e dini se trupi juaj është tempulli i Frymës së Shenjtë që është në ju? Mos u dehni me verë, ku është e tepërt, por plot, ose të mbusheni me Frymë" (1Co 6:19-20,Eph 5:18). Por tani këtu është një marrëdhënie e tretë.<br/>Ti do të marrësh dinamizmin, kur Shpirti i Shenjtë do të vijë mbi ty ose mbi ty, ose kur të ketë përmbytje prej teje, dhe ti do të më bëhesh dëshmitarët e mi (Veprat 1:8)<br/>Dhe kështu dinamika, për të qenë dëshmitar për Jezu Krishtin, është interesante që fjala dëshmitar në greqisht është fjala e martirizimit të fjalës sonë, dhe në greqisht kjo do të thotë martir. Një dëshmitar është ai që jo vetëm shpall atë që beson, ai jeton atë që beson, ai është ai që beson, dhe beson aq fort, sa nëse është e nevojshme, ai do të vdesë për atë që beson. Ai nuk ka frikë të vdesë për atë që beson.<br/>Ju kujtohet kur Pali ishte kthyer në Jeruzalem dhe Agabi zbriti nga Cezareja dhe mori brezin e Palit, e lidhi veten me të dhe tha: “Éshtë ai njeri që zotëron këtë brez për t’u lidhur, kur ai shkon në Jeruzalem”. Shokët e Palit filluan të qajnë, duke thënë: “Oh, Pali, mos shko, mos shko!”. Dhe ai tha: “Ç’kuptim ke me këto lot? Mendon se do të më shqetësosh? Mendon se jam i shqetësuar se jam i detyruar të vdes? Unë jam gati të vdes”. Unë jam gati të vdes, sepse deri në vdekje për besimin tuaj nuk të bëri një martir; sepse ju ishit një martir, ju u vratë, sepse ishit dëshmitarë, sepse besonit shumë të fortë. Pra, kjo nuk ju bëri dëshmitar, vetëm se ju ishit dëshmitarë të të gjithëve, nëse nuk do të kishit qenë mjeshtër, nuk do të kishit shkuar kurrë në vdekjen tuaj. Ju do të rehabilitoheshit, ju do të thatë: "Po, kë, prisni. Të mbajmë, të ndryshojmë kursin këtu, mendoj se mund të kem bërë një gabim." Pastaj ti thua: "Epo, nuk ishte një martus. Vjedhja e një kali nuk të bën hajdut; ajo vetëm që provon se nuk ke qenë; askush nuk vjedh një kalë nëse është një hajdut kali. Pra, vjedhjet nuk të bëjnë një hajdut kali, kjo vetëm dëshmon se ju ishit të gjithë të martirizuar, vetëm se atë që ishit dëshmitarë, një maturi, “Dhe ju do të jeni dëshmitarë!”, dhe a nuk është interesante që shumica e tyre u martirizuan?”<br/>Dëshmitari duhej të ishte edhe në Jeruzalem, edhe në gjithë Judenë (Vepra 1:8),<br/>Dëshmitari filloi në shtëpi dhe vendi më i vështirë, apo jo? Është për të filluar pikërisht në shtëpi në Jeruzalem, pastaj në rrethinat e Jeruzalemit, në zonën e Judesë dhe pastaj për t’u shpërndarë në Samari. Dhe pastaj ishte për të shkuar në pjesët më të largëta të botës. Dhe ndërsa studiojmë librin e Veprave, do të shohim këtë përparim.Si nisi dëshmitari në Jeruzalem, ne do ta marrim atë në kapitullin tjetër. Pastaj shohim se si filloi të përhapet në Jude, dhe më pas Filipi u ngjit në Samari dhe më në fund Pali dhe Barnaba thirren për të shkuar në skajet e botës. Dhe kështu dëshmitari u përhap nëpërmjet vajosjes dhe fuqizimin e Frymës së Shenjtë.<br/>Dhe, mbasi i tha këto gjëra, ndërsa ata po e shihnin, u ngrit lart; dhe një re e përfshiu dhe ua hoqi prej syve të tyre (Veprat 1:9).<br/>Ky është premtimi përfundimtar që u ka bërë Jezusi dishepujve të Tij. Kjo është fjala, fjalët e fundit që i paraprijnë ngjitjes së Tij.Sigurisht, ai erdhi dhe bisedoi me Palin dhe të tjerët, por përpara ngjitjes së Tij, kjo është fjala e Tij e fundit. Dhe mbi këtë, kur ai i tha këto gjëra, ndërsa ata po e ndiqnin, ai u ngrit lart dhe një re e përfshiu dhe ua hoqi prej syve të tyre.<br/>Dhe ndërsa ata po shikonin në mënyrë të qëndrueshme drejt qiellit kur ai u ngjit, ja, ishin dy burra që qëndruan pranë tyre me rroba të bardha (Vepra 1:10);<br/>Ne supozojmë se ata ishin engjëj.<br/>16 Në qoftë se disa thoshnin gjithashtu: ''Burra Galileas, pse qëndroni atje në qiell? Ky Jezus, që është ngritur nga ju në qiell, do të vijë po kështu siç e keni parë të shkojë në qiell (Veprat 1:11).<br/>Ata e panë Atë që u ngjit në qiell dhe e panë kur ai u kthye; dhe ja, Zoti po vjen me dhjetë mijë shenjtorë të tij për të gjykuar mbi tokë" (Jud 1:14-15). Dhe pastaj, " atij që na deshi dhe na dha veten, dhe neve që na bëri neve, mbretërve dhe priftërinjve që do të mbretërojnë me Të në tokë, ja që Zoti po vjen, dhe çdo sy do ta shohë dhe ata që e tejshpuan do të vajtojnë" Rev 1:5-7). 32 Pra, kur të vijë Zoti, secili do ta shohë; dhe Dëshmitarët e Zotit thonë se ai tashmë ka ardhur, por ishte një sekret që po vinte; siç e kishin parë, pra, vetëm dishepujt e tij, që e kishin parë Atë të kthehej përsëri. Por Jezusi u tha atyre: ''Në qoftë se ju thonë: "Ai ka ardhur fshehurazi dhe ka shkuar në një dhomë të fshehtë, mos e besoni" (Mat 24:26).<br/>Ky Jezus, që ngrihet prej jush në qiell, do të vijë ashtu siç e keni parë Atë të shkojë në qiell.<br/>Tani ka një varg shumë interesant në II Gjoni, ajeti 1:7, "Sepse shumë mashtrues kanë hyrë në botë që nuk rrëfejnë se Jezu Krishti ka ardhur në mish." Kjo, për fat të keq, është një përkthim i dobët i greqishtes. Sepse kjo pjesë është në kohën e sotme dhe duhet të përkthehet "po vjen në mish", e kush do të mohojë se Jezu Krishti po vjen në mish, çfarë thotë Gjoni për ta? "Ata janë mashtrues dhe antikrisht. Shiko për veten tënde se mos i humbim ato që kemi bërë, por se të marrim një shpërblim të plotë, sepse kushdo që shkel dhe nuk qëndron në doktrinën e Krishtit, nuk ka Perëndi. Ai që qëndron në doktrinën e Krishtit, ka të dy Atin dhe Birin; dhe, në qoftë se ka ardhur ndonjë në derën tënde (të shtunën në mëngjes) dhe nuk e sjell këtë doktrinë, mos e pranoni në shtëpinë tuaj dhe mos i jepni atij punë të mirë. Sepse ai që i jep lamtumirën është pjesëmarrësi i veprave të tij të këqija" (2JN 1:7-11). Bëji një pyetje, "A po vjen Jezusi në mish?", Thjesht përgjigjuni atyre dhe në qoftë se ata nuk e thonë, vetëm kujtoni çfarë ju ka thënë Gjoni dhe çfarë ju ka thënë Gjoni. Nëse ndokush nuk rrëfen se Jezu Krishti vjen në mish, a kujtoni kur ai ishte me dishepujt dhe tha: “Më jep diçka për të ngrënë?” Ai tha: “Ju e dini, frymëra nuk hani; më prekni, por unë ja, unë jam!” Pra, ky Jezusi po vjen përsëri në të njëjtën mënyrë në të cilën e panë të hyjë në qiell; dhe unë, për një, besoj se e ardhmja është shumë shpejt.<br/>Pastaj ata u kthyen në Jeruzalem, nga mali që quhet i Ullinjve, që është nga Jeruzalemi një rrugë e shtunë, [rreth dy të tretat e një milje]. Kur u kthyen në qytet, u ngjitën në sallën e sipërme, ku rrinin Pjetri dhe Jakobi, Gjoni, Andrea, Filipi dhe Thomai, Bartolomeu dhe Mateu, Jakobi i Alfeut dhe Simon Zellshmi, dhe Juda i Jakobit. Dhe të gjithë këta ngulmonin me një mendje të vetme në lutje dhe përgjërim së bashku me gratë, me Marinë, nënën e Jezusit, dhe me vëllezërit e tij (Veprat 1:12-14).<br/>Kjo është përmendja e fundit e Marisë, nënës së Jezusit. Në këtë pikë dhe nga kjo pikë e tutje, nuk përmendet më për të në Veprat e Apostujve ose në shëmbëlltyra, asnjë përmendje e vdekjes së saj ose e ngjitjes së saj të mrekullueshme në qiell, pa vdekje. Në Shkrim nuk përmendet asgjë. Është e heshtur.<br/>Vëllezërit e tij do të ishin një referencë ndoshta për Jakobin dhe Judën dhe për ata vëllezër të tjerë që ishin bij të Jozefit dhe Marisë.<br/>Dhoma e sipërme – ka disa që thonë se është e njëjta dhomë e sipërme në të cilën Jezusi kishte Darkën e Fundit me dishepujt e Tij. E megjithatë, ka të tjerë që e mbajnë këtë dhomë të sipërme duke qenë një dhomë në rrethinat e tempullit ku u takua kisha e hershme. Merrni zgjedhjen tuaj.<br/>Në ato ditë Pjetri u çua në mes të dishepujve (dhe numri i emrave të tyre ishte rreth njëqind e njëzet) dhe tha: ''Ky Shkrim duhet të jetë përmbushur, të cilin Fryma e Shenjtë e parafoli me anë të gojës së Davidit në lidhje me Judën, i cili ishte një udhërrëfyes për ata që e morën Jezusin (Veprat 1:15-16).<br/>Këtu sërish, Pjetri ende është vetë ai vetë i njëtrajtshëm dhe në pritje të lutjes e të lutjes, dhe Pjetri ngrihet lart e thotë: “Njerëzit, ka një shkrim që duhet plotësuar”. Dhe ju e dini se ai do të shkojë përpara, "Le ta marrim programin duke shkuar; le të hedhim shumë dhe të zbulojmë se kush do të zërë vendin e Judës". Unë mendoj se Pjetri ishte përsëri në mish, duke treguar se natyra spontane e tij. Mendoj se e ardhmja e historisë së kishës në librin e Veprave thekson këtë. Unë jam i interesuar për kuptimin e Pjetrit për shkrimet e shenjta, se si ai po citon kaq shumë vende në Dhiatën e Vjetër. Pjetri manifeston një kuptim shumë të madh të shkrimeve të Dhiatës së Vjetër që është një pikë në favor të tij.<br/>Vini re se Pjetri i përshkruan Frymës së Shenjtë ato gjëra që i ka shkruar Davidi, që: “I gjithë Shkrimi të jepet me anë të frymëzimit të Perëndisë" (2Ti 3:16). Sepse, në qoftë se ju më thoni atë pjesë të shkrimeve të shenjta janë dhënë me anë të frymëzimit të Perëndisë, atëherë unë duhet t'ju pyes: "Ci pjesë janë me frymëzim dhe cilat pjesë nuk janë me frymëzim?" Dhe atëherë ju jeni autoriteti që më thotë se çfarë pjese mund të besoj dhe çfarë pjese nuk mund të besoj. Dhe minuta që Zoti nuk është më autoriteti, por ju jeni autoriteti, unë jam në telashe. Kini kujdes nga ata që thonë: “Vërtet, ju nuk mund t’u besoni të gjithë shkrimeve të shenjta”. Vetë Shkrimet thonë: “I gjithë Shkrimi është i dhënë me anë të frymëzimit të Perëndisë.” Dhe ja, Luka me shkrim rreth asaj që thoshte Pjetri, deklaron se Davidi ishte në të vërtetë zëdhënës i Frymës së Shenjtë, që nëpërmjet gojës së Davidit fliste për Judën.<br/>Ai u numërua te ne (ai ishte një nga të dymbëdhjetët) dhe ai mori një pjesë të kësaj shërbese; por tani ky njeri bleu një arë me shpërblimin e paudhësisë dhe ra kokëposhtë (Veprat 1:17-18),<br/>Ai bleu fushën, fushën e poterit si Zakaria, kapitulli i njëmbëdhjetë deklaron.<br/>dhe duke rënë kokëposhtë, shpërtheu në mes dhe të gjitha zorrët dolën jashtë (Veprat 1:18).<br/>Ka nga ata që gjejnë një mospërputhje në shkrimet e shenjta, sepse në një nga ungjijtë ne na thuhet se kur Juda u kthye dhe u përpoq për të kthyer paratë, dhe ata thanë: "Hej, kjo është problemi juaj. Ne nuk mund ta marrim atë." Ai e hodhi mbi dyshemenë e tempullit, doli jashtë dhe u ul; ja, Pjetri na thotë se ai ra kokëposhtë dhe sapo u paraqit; dhe ka nga ata që imagjinojnë një mospërputhje. Ai u ngjit shumë i thjeshtë në pemë për të varur veten e tij, e lidhi litarin rreth qafës së tij dhe e lidhi deri në gjymtyrë, u hodh me forcën e rënies ose me litar ose me kokën e tij, dhe ra poshtë në kanion dhe ashtu siç e tha këtu.<br/>Kjo u muar vesh nga të gjithë banorët e Jeruzalemit, aq sa ara quhet në gjuhën e tyre, Akeldama, që do të thotë: "Ara e gjakut". Sepse është shkruar në librin e Psalmeve: ''Shtëpia e tij le të jetë e shkretë dhe askush të mos qëndrojë në të. Dhe, peshkopi le të marrë një tjetër (Veprat 1:19-20).<br/>Tani në realitet ai citon nga dy Psalmet e ndryshme këtu. Nga Psa 69:25, ai e vendos atë së bashku me PSA 109:8. Dhe i vendos të dy së bashku këto profeci në lidhje me Judën.<br/>Prandaj të këtyre burrave (Vepra 1:21)<br/>Ja ku janë duke kërkuar dikë që të zërë vendin e Judës për të qenë apostull; ja kualifikimet që i kërkuan në atë kohë.<br/>Prandaj prej këtyre burrave që kanë qenë në shoqërinë tonë gjithë kohën në të cilën Zoti Jezus, kur ishte brenda e jashtë në mes nesh (Vepra 1:21),<br/>Dhe ju po mbani mend se kishte shumë dishepuj, nga të cilët Jezusi zgjodhi dhjetë për të qenë apostuj. Dhe fjala apostull do të thotë "ai që është dërguar" ose që ka zgjedhur dymbëdhjetë të jetë apostuj, andaj i dërgoi të dymbëdhjetët: numrin e qeverisjes njerëzore. Ne kemi vetëm një të njëmbëdhjetët dhe duhet të zëmë vendin e Judës, por ne kemi nevojë për atë që ka qenë me ne gjithë kohën që nga fillimi me Jezusin."<br/>Që nga koha kur ai u pagëzua nga Gjoni, e deri në ditën që u hoq prej nesh, duhet të shugurohet dikush që të jetë dëshmitar i ringjalljes së Tij (Vepra 1:22).<br/>Këto ishin kërkesat që ata po kërkonin; dikush që kishte qenë rreth e qark; që nga koha e pagëzimit të Gjonit e deri në ngritje, dhe që pa Zotin e ringjallur, e kështu mund të jepte dëshmi për ringjalljen, për të vërtetën e tyre.<br/>Apostulli Pavël, më vonë duke pohuar se ai ishte një apostull tha: "A nuk e kam parë unë Krishtin e ringjallur?" Me sa duket, kjo ishte një nga kërkesat e apostullimit. Dikush më pyeti mua, "A ka apostuj sot?" E pra, unë nuk e di. Unë nuk mendoj se ka në të njëjtën kuptim që ata ishin në Dhiatën e Re, me siguri që sot nuk ka asnjë që mund të dëshmojë për ringjalljen siç bënë ata.<br/>Ata zgjodhën dy: Jozefi, i quajtur Barsaba, që ishte i mbiquajtur Just, dhe Matia, dhe u lutën duke thënë: ''Ti, Zot, që i njeh zemrat e të gjithë njerëzve, trego a është e njëjta gjë nga këta të dy që ti ke zgjedhur (Veprat 1:23-24),<br/>Mendoj se shpesh e bëjmë këtë gabim duke i dhënë Zotit dy zgjedhje, të dyja të gabuara. Kufizimi i Perëndisë, ju shihni. Ne jemi kaq të prirur ta bëjmë këtë. Natyrisht, Pali ishte zgjedhja e Perëndisë. Pjetri ishte i fortë, dhe duke kërcyer armë tha, "Hej, ne kemi marrë për të bërë diçka, ju e dini, gotta të ndihmuar Perëndinë jashtë. Ju e dini, një është zhdukur dhe ne kemi marrë për të mbushur atë në. "Dhe ende, të cilat një nga këto dy ju doni?", dhe duke i dhënë Perëndisë dy zgjedhje.<br/>Që ai të mund të marrë pjesë në këtë shërbesë dhe në këtë apostull, nga i cili u rrëzua Juda, që të mund të shkojë në vendin e tij; dhe kështu ata i dhanë plaçkat e tyre (Veprat 1:25-26);<br/>Një mënyrë interesante me të cilën ata kërkuan të përcaktojnë vullnetin e Perëndisë. Le të hedhim zare, të gjejmë se çfarë vullneti i Perëndisë është këtu., Është interesante për mua, mënyrat e ndryshme që njerëzit kanë hartuar për të dalluar vullnetin e Perëndisë. Tani, në kohën e Dhiatës së Vjetër ata kishin një mënyrë interesante për të ardhur te prifti, i cili do të pyeste për ta nëpërmjet Urimit dhe Thumimit “dritat dhe perfeksionimet”. Vetëm atë që ishin këta Urim dhe Thumim, ne nuk e dimë. Unë jam i sigurt se ata nuk ishin syzet me ngjyrë që Jozef Smithi gjeti me Pllakat e Artë; syzet magjike, që kur i vendosnit, ju papritmas mund të lexonit shkrimin hieroglifik.<br/>Ka nga ata që thonë se Urimi dhe Thumimi ishin në të vërtetë një gur i zi dhe i bardhë që ishte veshur në një qese në kraharorin e priftit. Ata do të luteshin dhe do t’i bënin Zotit një pyetje të veçantë. Ju kujtohet që Davidi i bënte Zotit pyetje të caktuara: "Zot, a duhet të dalim kundër Filistejve?", përgjigjja ishte: "Jo, të nesërmen do të dalim kundër Filistejve?". Ata do të bënin pyetje specifike dhe Zoti do t’i drejtonte ato përmes Urimit dhe Thuminës; Ata thonë se prifti do të lutej, kërkonte Perëndinë, dhe pastaj do të arrinte një nga dy gurët, po të ishte një përgjigje. Nëse ishte jo, atëherë do të ishte guri i zi që ai do të tërhiqej.Disa madje thonë se ne marrim termin e blackballed nga ky Urim dhe Thummim.Në të vërtetë, në origjinal nuk është votë kundër një projekti apo ideje të veçantë. Atë që ishte Urimi dhe Thumimi, ne nuk e dimë, por gjatë periudhës së Dhjatës së Vjetër, ata përdorën një metodë të hedhjes shumë për të përcaktuar vullnetin e Perëndisë.<br/>Kështu që këtu dishepujt po marrin të njëjtën gjë me të cilën po hedhin zare për të parë se cili nga dy shokët që Perëndia kishte zgjedhur për të zëvendësuar Judë Iskariotin.<br/>Loti ra mbi Matthiasin; ai u numërua në të njëmbëdhjetë (Vepra 1:26).<br/>Tani kush në botë është Matthias, askush nuk e ka dëgjuar kurrë më parë ose më pas, do të jetë interesante të takosh Matthiasin dhe të zbuloj se kush është ai dhe çfarë ka bërë. Unë mendoj që nga historia e mëvonshme, është e qartë se Perëndia zgjodhi Palin si apostull. Kjo është hera e fundit që lexojmë ndonjëherë për ta, duke kërkuar të dallosh vullnetin e Perëndisë duke hedhur shortin ose duke pasur shansin për një gjë.<br/>Unë sot njoh një mik, duke kërkuar të dallosh vullnetin e Zotit, do të lutem dhe do t’i bëj një pyetje Zotit. Ai do të ketë dhjetë peni në xhepin e tij dhe ndërsa lutet, do t'i marrë qindarkat me sytë e mbyllur dhe do t'i vërë në tryezë, dhe nëse të gjithë do të dalin kokë, është po. Një gjë interesante, çdo herë pas here, ata të gjithë do të vijnë në kokë, dhe kjo është shanse shumë e mirë., Megjithatë, ne nuk gjejmë asnjë model për këtë pasi Fryma e Shenjtë u dha. Sapo Fryma e Shenjtë erdhi mbi kishën, atëherë Fryma e Shenjtë filloi t'u flasë atyre dhe t'i drejtojë; dhe Fryma e Shenjtë tha: "Më ndani mua Palin dhe Barnabën për shërbesën ku i kam thirrur" (Veprat 13:2). Dhe Fryma e Shenjtë i dërgoi ata, kështu që ne e gjejmë kishën më të drejtuar drejtpërdrejt nga Fryma e Shenjtë. Sapo Fryma e Shenjtë erdhi, kjo thënie hedh poshtë vullnetin e Perëndisë.<br/>"<br/><br/>King James Version<br/><br/>Ky është versioni 1769 i Biblës së Shenjtë (i njohur gjithashtu edhe si versioni i autorizuar).

Yes that is correct, the Urbanears don't have a built in noise cancelling mic on the headphone itself but from what I can see there is a mic on the cable provided.<br/>1. Well the mic is usually placed where it can have a connection to the PCB which are within the headphones so if you mean that the mic shouldn't be on the headphone itself, that (from my experience) is incorrect.<br/>2.

In fact, dynamic drivers work exactly the same as dynamic microphones but in reverse. Inside a dynamic driver there is a magnet, and when you plug in the headphones, you are sending a AC current through it which will turn the voice coil into a magnet. Depending on the direction of the current, the polarity of the magnet will change. Now since we know for a magnet, same charges repels and different charges attract, we know that the voice coil will move back and forth depending on it's polarity at the time. The voice coil is attached to the diaphragm which will then move back and forth creating a sound wave. The same occurs in reverse, if you move a coil through a magnet you produce a current instead. Since your voice is pushing the diaphragm, it is moving the voice coil back and forth generating the current you have observed.<br/><br/>100+ Head-Fier<br/><br/>Joined:<br/>Nov 7, 2011<br/><br/>Posts:<br/>134<br/><br/>Likes: 55<br/><br/>Exactly.

Po kjo është e saktë, Urbanistët nuk kanë një mikrofon që shkëputet nga zhurma, por nga ajo që unë mund të shoh se ka një mikrofon në kabllon e ofruar.<br/>1. E pra mikrofoni është zakonisht vendosur ku mund të ketë një lidhje me PCB të cilat janë brenda kufjeve kështu që nëse do të thotë se mikrofoni nuk duhet të jetë në vetë kufje, kjo (nga përvoja ime) është e pasaktë.<br/>2.

Brenda një shoferi dinamik ka një magnet, dhe kur futeni në kufje, po dërgoni një rrymë AC përmes saj e cila do ta kthejë zërin në një magnet.Në varësi të rrymës, polariteti i magnetit do të ndryshojë.

Stalin's opposition within the party, including Bukharin, Yagoda and Rykov were purged in these show trials, as Stalin manipulatively forced them to confess to crimes of planning a coup and opposing the state, even if there was no proof. Gabor T Rittersporn said, "Many of the victims were sincerely devoted to the principles of Bolshevism." This amplifies proof that the Bolshevik ideals that had once been the roots of the Communist Party were being disarranged and destroyed by the Purges. The party was depleted and former members helplessly watched Stalin use the great purge as a tool to transform Russia from a one party state to an unchallenged dictatorship. Again, the purges were shattering the framework of the Communist Party, formed during the Bolshevik revolution. This agrees with the "Stalin the executioner" source as both show the manipulative character, that helped the dictator to enhance his grip on Russia's throat.<br/>The manipulative manner, with which Stalin incriminated his targeted opposition during the purges, in the eyes of everyday Russians, also had an implosive impact on Soviet Society. Stalin was able to collect support from the people through his use of propaganda and the media to help him develop a "cult of personality" and the image of a heroic and brave leader. Through this support Stalin implanted mistrust into the minds of the people, convincing them that traitors of the revolution and what he described as 'enemies of the people', were amongst them.

Kundërshtimi i Stalinit brenda partisë, përfshirë Bukharin, Jagodën dhe Rykovin u spastruan në këto gjyqe shfaqjesh, pasi Stalini i detyroi me manipulim të pranonin krimet e planifikimit të një grushti shteti dhe kundërshtimi i shtetit, edhe pse nuk kishte prova. Gabor T Rittersporn tha: "Shumë nga viktimat ishin të përkushtuar sinqerisht ndaj parimeve të bolshevizmit". Kjo përforcon dëshmi se idealet bolshevike që dikur kishin qenë rrënjët e Partisë Komuniste u çarmatosën dhe u shkatërruan nga Pururgët. Partia u varfërua dhe ish-anëtarët panë pafuqinë që Stalini e përdori si mjet për ta transformuar Rusinë nga një shtet partie në një diktaturë të pashoqe. Përsëri spastrimet po shpartallonin kuadrin e Partisë Komuniste, të formuara gjatë revolucionit bolshevik.

Stalini qe në gjendje të mblidhte mbështetje nga populli përmes përdorimit të tij të propagandës dhe të medias për ta ndihmuar të zhvillonte një “kult të personalitetit” dhe imazhin e një udhëheqësi heroik dhe të guximshëm. Me anë të kësaj mbështetjeje, Stalini ngriti mosbesim në mendjet e njerëzve, duke i bindur ata se tradhtarët e revolucionit dhe ato që ai i cilësoi si ‘armiq të popullit’, ishin mes tyre dhe kjo rrjedhimisht ndezi luftën shoqërore,...<br/><br/>Letra të tjera Si cila ishte rëndësia afatshkurtër e spastrimeve për qeverinë dhe shoqërinë ruse<br/><br/>1203 fjalë - 5 faqe<br/>Shtetet e Bashkuara vendosën marrëveshje me kombe në të gjithë botën për të eliminuar barrierat ndaj tregtisë dhe investimeve ndërkombëtare që nga Lufta e Dytë Botërore.

| Supercell is nerfing brawlers instead of nerfing star powers. I was at 750 last season with power 8 nita and it is very tough to go past that, like, star powers play a really dominant role. The matchmaking is also trash. When i play gem grab(around 600 trophies), there are often matchups where the enemy team has one more player than us who is maxed and it's not even that we have a lvl 9 to compete versus that. Sometimes there are even matchups where the enemy team is fully maxed and none of us are. this is why i dont play brawl stars seriously anymore. It's not even like there arent many players who are not maxed and around 600 trophies. It's annoying.<br/>Edit: I think supercell should have at least a basic mechanism that takes the average of levels of brawlers when setting up matches.<br/><br/>Except trophies don't really indicate your skill. They indicate the skill of the teammates you are placed with. And I'm fine with playing against higher level brawlers, but when one team is all level 10 and the other team isn't, clearly it's unbalanced.<br/><br/>I reccomend getting some good friends to play with, me and 2 friends got my friends power 1 tick to rank 28 by playing gem grab with a certain composition all day and we made it without a single one of us being maxed with our brawlers.<br/><br/>I Know how you feel I used to have brawlers in high trophies with low level and it's to difficult to go more further and everything I was saying to myself "I want to have star powers" really supercell needs to make balance to the star powers or at least make a better matchmaking system.<br/><br/>I kinda feel this. I ain't as good at the game as you, but I got Emz to 500 at power 1 and the matchmaking was horrible. Maxed out players everywhere! And it didn't help that the majority of my teammates had around 5-8k trophies... I had to resort to solo showdown last minute because I can either ambush unsuspecting players or simply play a little aggressive at the right times. But I really wish that it could be a bit easier for people who want to push brawlers to really high trophy ranges without having the luxury of star powers.<br/><br/>Altho spike is still good without curveball. Curveball was just a help for hitting your shots more often as spike. But even before curveball was released, spike was a really strong brawler, so he will remain the same now.<br/><br/>I agree that they should have nerfed ambush, but I think they are trying to balance both Snappy Sniping and Ambush, as they are both getting merged with this change. She was becoming a little powerful, but still not nerf-worthy<br/><br/>I'm not sure about this, but now that Darryl got a noticeable buff, looking at their new stats, it looks like Darryl might overshadow Bull, as not only he can always deal more damage than Bull, he won't die as early anymore, so their survivability will be similar without star power (although Bull's survivability is still noticeably better than Darryl's if he had Tough Guy). Not only that, Darryl's super can auto regenerate, meaning Darryl MIGHT be able to be played effectively both as a heavyweight AND an assassin at the same time (before he sucks as a heavyweight but decent as an assassin)<br/><br/>But hes overrated af. And you get trophies with him really easily. So im kinda ok with the nerf. I havent even played him since when I got him to 500 (around 5 months ago), so not that I care that much either.<br/><br/>Why doesn't Poco/Penny get a HP nerf, if they are Marksman/Healer respectively not a tank?<br/>Why isn't Rosa's tankyness nerfed, cough 70% damage reduction?<br/>Why is Tick allowed to have the highest range and the most free pokedamage in the entire game?<br/>Why doesn't Leon get a HP/Damage buff?<br/><br/>Be that as it may, it was Ambush that was OP, not base Piper. I would argue that Ambush is the best star power in the game (now even more so since the percentage of damage increase indirectly went up) and base Piper was a bottom-10 brawler.<br/><br/>What Supercell should do is revert both nerfs, reduce Ambush to 600, and reduce Snappy Sniping to 0.25 since it'd be indirectly buffed by the base damage buff.<br/><br/>Yea and I believe they went a bit too far with Rosa, because now she is basically the better bull now when it comes to tanking, which she has been for a while. Now, Darryl might as well be a smaller, more powerful bull<br/><br/>Why? I feel she needs a buff in almost everything except her star power. Her health and speed make her super a bit more difficult to use, because she can die pretty easily, and it is really difficult for her to trap faster brawlers like Crow. Her star power is a bit broken though... | Supercell është nerfing xhagajdar në vend të nerfit të fuqive yll.Unë kam qenë në 750 sezonin e fundit me fuqinë 8 nita dhe është shumë e vështirë të kalosh atë, si, fuqitë e yjeve luajnë një rol të vërtetë dominues.

Unë nuk jam aq i mirë në lojë sa ju, por e mora Emz në 500 në pushtet 1 dhe mbledhja ishte e tmerrshme., Lexuar nga lojtarët kudo!, Dhe kjo nuk ndihmoi që shumica e shokëve të mi të kishte rreth 5-8k trofe... Më është dashur të përdorem vetëm për të shfaqur minutën e fundit sepse mund të luaja pak abusht që nuk dyshojnë në lojë ose thjesht të luaja pak agresivë në kohën e duhur. Por unë me të vërtetë dëshiroj që mund të jetë pak më e lehtë për njerëzit që duan të shtyjnë crawlers të me të vërtetë vargjet me trofe të lartë pa pasur luksin e fuqive të yjeve.<br/><br/>Altho kapërcja është ende e mirë pa kthina.Curveball ishte vetëm një ndihmë për të goditur pozat tuaja më shpesh si kapërcye.Por edhe para se të lëshojë biberoni, kafjali ishte një shkelës vërtet i fortë, kështu që ai do të mbetet i njëjtë tani.<br/><br/>Jam dakord që ata të kenë nerfed pritë, por mendoj se janë duke u përpjekur të balancojnë të dy Snapy Sniping dhe Ambus, pasi të dy po bashkohen me këtë ndryshim.Ajo ishte duke u bërë pak e fuqishme, por ende jo nervoze<br/><br/>Unë nuk jam i sigurt për këtë, por tani që Darryl mori një shuplakë të dukshme, duke kërkuar në statistikat e tyre të reja, duket si Darryl mund të mbijë Bull, pasi jo vetëm që ai gjithmonë mund të trajtojë më shumë dëme se Bull, ai nuk do të vdes më herët, kështu që mbijetueshmëria e tyre do të jetë e ngjashme pa energji yll (edhe pse mbijetueshmëria e Bull është ende dukshëm më e mirë se Darryl's nëse ai kishte Djalë i Vështirë). Jo vetëm kaq, super-mund të rigjenerohet nga Darryl, që do të thotë se Darryl MIGHT mund të luhet në mënyrë efektive si një peshë e rëndë dhe si një vrasës në të njëjtën kohë (para se ai të thith si një peshë e rëndë, por të mirë si një vrasës)<br/><br/>Dhe ti me të vërtetë mund të kesh me vete trofe, kështu që im kinda ok me nerfin, madje e kam luajtur atë që kur e kam arritur atë në 500 (rreth 5 muaj më parë), kështu që jo se unë e dua atë shumë.<br/><br/>Pse Poco/Penny nuk merr një futje HP, nëse ata janë Marksman/Healer përkatësisht jo një tank?<br/>Pse nuk është ushqyer tankshmëria e Roza, kollë 70% reduktimi i dëmit?<br/>Pse Tick lejohet të ketë gamën më të lartë dhe imazhin më të lirë në të gjithë lojën?<br/>Pse Leon-i nuk arrin të dalë nga HP/Damage buff?<br/><br/>Të jetë kështu siç mund të ishte, ajo ishte Abushi që ishte OP, jo bazë Piper., Unë do të argumentonte se Ambu është fuqia më e mirë yll në lojë (tani edhe më shumë që nga përqindja e dëmtimit të rritet në mënyrë indirekte) dhe baza Piper ishte një shkelës i fundit-10.<br/><br/>Ajo që Supercell duhet të bëjë është të zhbërë të dy nerfs, të zvogëlojë Ambushin në 600, dhe të zvogëlojë Snappy Sniping në 0.25 pasi ajo do të jetë në mënyrë indirekte buffed nga dëme bazë tifoz.<br/><br/>Po dhe unë besoj se ata shkuan shumë larg me Rosa, sepse tani ajo është në thelb demi më i mirë tani kur është fjala për tank, e cila ajo ka qenë për një kohë. Tani, Darryl mund të jetë edhe një dem më të vogël, më të fuqishme<br/><br/>Pse? Ndihem se ajo ka nevojë për një buff në pothuajse çdo gjë përveç pushtetit të saj yll.Shëndeti i saj dhe shpejtësia e bëjnë atë super pak më të vështirë për t'u përdorur, sepse ajo mund të vdes shumë lehtë, dhe është me të vërtetë e vështirë për të kurth crawlers më të shpejtë si Crow. Fuqia e saj yll është pak e thyer edhe pse... |

| Self-Employment Part 1<br/><br/>When you accept an employment in any organisation, you have to perform various jobs as per the requirements of your employer and you may get a fixed amount of income as salary. You may run a small retail shop, tailoring shop, restaurant, bakery and confectionery, beauty salon, etc. in your locality. You may get engaged in trading or manufacturing on a small scale or providing some service for a price. Such economic activities are known as self-employment.<br/><br/>Meaning of Self-Employment<br/><br/>Earning is necessary for a living. Our father, mother, brothers, sisters and others may be engaged in different economic activities through which they earn their livelihood. These persons are engaged in an economic activity which is termed as wage employment or paid employment. But there are many persons who engage themselves in an occupation or some business which they start and manage on their own. They put in their best effort and take all types of risks to pursue their careers successfully. The entire earning of their work goes to them. All of us have seen small grocery shops, tailoring shops, medical stores etc. in our locality. These are owned and managed by a person, with or without the help of some assistants. Their economic activities are termed as self-employment. So, when an individual engages in any economic activity and manages it on his own, it is known as self-employment.<br/><br/>Objectives<br/><br/>After studying this lesson, you will be able to:<br/><br/>Image of Objectives<br/><br/>Image of Objectives<br/><br/>Characteristics of Self-Employment<br/><br/>It involves ownership and management of activities by a person although he/she may take the help of one or two persons to assist him/her. Thus, self-employment may provide employment to other persons as well.<br/><br/>The earning from self-employment is not fixed. It depends on the income one can earn by producing or buying and selling goods or providing services to others at a price.<br/><br/>In self-employment, the owner alone has to take the profit and bear the risk of loss. So, we find a direct link between the effort and reward in self-employment.<br/><br/>It requires some amount of capital investment, although it may be small.<br/><br/>In self-employment, a person is free to take decisions in respect of running his business profitably and avail of any opportunity that may come up for expansion of his business. It gives complete freedom to work as per one's own will and within the parameters of the prevailing laws.<br/><br/>Thus, self-employment may be defined as, an economic activity which one may perform on his own as a gainful occupation, and this may consist of producing and selling goods, buying and selling goods, or rendering services for a price. | Vetëpunësim Pjesa 1<br/><br/>Kur pranoni një punësim në çdo organizatë, duhet të kryeni punë të ndryshme sipas kërkesave të punëdhënësit tuaj dhe mund të merrni një shumë fikse të të ardhurave si pagë. Ju mund të bëni një dyqan të vogël me pakicë, rrobaqepës, restorant, furrë buke dhe ëmbëlsira, sallon bukurie, etj në vendin tuaj.Ju mund të angazhoheni në tregti ose prodhim në një shkallë të vogël ose duke ofruar një shërbim për një çmim. Aktivitetet e tilla ekonomike njihen si vetë-punësim.<br/><br/>Domethënia e vetëpunësimit<br/><br/>Të fituarit është e nevojshme për të jetuar.Babai ynë, nëna, vëllezërit, motrat dhe të tjerët mund të jenë të angazhuar në aktivitete të ndryshme ekonomike përmes të cilave ata fitojnë jetesën e tyre. Këta persona janë të angazhuar në një aktivitet ekonomik i cili quhet punësim me pagë ose punësim me pagesë, por ka shumë persona që angazhohen vetë në një profesion ose disa biznes që ata fillojnë dhe menaxhojnë më vete. Ata vënë në përpjekjet e tyre më të mira dhe marrin të gjitha llojet e rreziqeve për të ndjekur me sukses karrierën e tyre.I gjithë fitimi i punës së tyre u shkon.Të gjithë ne kemi parë dyqane të vogla ushqimore, dyqane rrobaqepëse, dyqane mjekësore etj në vendin tonë. Këto janë në pronësi dhe në menaxhim nga një person, me ose pa ndihmën e disa asistentëve, aktivitetet e tyre ekonomike cilësohen si vetë-punësim.Pra, kur një individ angazhohet në çdo aktivitet ekonomik dhe e menaxhon vetë atë, ajo njihet si vetë-punësim.<br/><br/>Objektivat<br/><br/>Pas studimit të këtij mësimi, ju do të jetë në gjendje të:<br/><br/>Imazhi i objektivave<br/><br/>Imazhi i objektivave<br/><br/>Karakteristikat e vetë-punësimit<br/><br/>Ajo përfshin pronësinë dhe menaxhimin e aktiviteteve të një personi, edhe pse ai/ajo mund të marrë ndihmën e një ose dy personave për ta ndihmuar atë.Kështu, vetëpunësimi mund t’u sigurojë edhe personave të tjerë.<br/><br/>Fitimi nga vetëpunësimi nuk është i rregulluar, por varet nga të ardhurat që mund të fitojnë duke prodhuar ose blerë mallra ose duke u ofruar të tjerëve shërbime me një çmim.<br/><br/>Në vetë-punësim, i vetmi pronar duhet të marrë fitimin dhe të mbajë rrezikun e humbjes.Pra, ne gjejmë një lidhje të drejtpërdrejtë midis përpjekjeve dhe shpërblimit në vetë-punësim.<br/><br/>Kërkon një sasi investimi kapital, megjithëse mund të jetë i vogël.<br/><br/>Në vetëpunësim, një person është i lirë të marrë vendime në lidhje me drejtimin e biznesit të tij me fitim dhe të përfitojë nga çdo mundësi që mund të vijë për zgjerimin e biznesit të tij. Ajo i jep liri të plotë punës sipas vullnetit të vet dhe brenda parametrave të ligjeve mbizotëruese.<br/><br/>Kështu, vetëpunësimi mund të përkufizohet si, një aktivitet ekonomik të cilin njeriu mund ta kryejë vetë si një profesion fitimprurës dhe kjo mund të përbëhet nga prodhimi dhe shitja e mallrave, blerja dhe shitja e mallrave, ose ofrimi i shërbimeve me çmim. |
