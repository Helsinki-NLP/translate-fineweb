Undocumented migrants have nothing. They are not allowed to work. They have no right to state benefits nor to a place to live. They are unseen and potentially the most vulnerable group in the UK today.<br/><br/>Undocumented (or irregular) migrants include those trafficked into the sex trade or for domestic servitude; they include visa overstayers; those whose asylum applications have been refused and others who have been subject to failures in the immigration system. All of these may originally have come to the UK legally.<br/><br/>'Illegal immigrants' – those imagined to have entered the country in the backs of lorries – make up a small proportion of the undocumented.<br/><br/>Indeed some sources suggest that half the estimated 120,000 undocumented children in the UK were actually born here to undocumented parents. These children are disadvantaged from birth, solely by their immigration status.<br/><br/>The blog tells the stories of the undocumented. It highlights their daily struggles and vulnerabilities, but also their strength and resilience. It's not an easy read.<br/><br/>You can access the blog via our website (bottom of right hand column on Home Page).<br/><br/>The blog has won the online category of the Speaking Together media awards. The awards were a new addition this year to the Migrant and Refugee Woman of the Year Awards celebration at the Royal Festival Hall in London as part of International Women's Day. The panel of judges – including novelist and playwright Gillian Slovo, and journalist and author, Hannah Pool – was particularly looking for work that challenged myths and stereotypes.<br/><br/>The blog has also won the Blog North Awards 2013 in the Best Writing category and was also shortlisted for an Amnesty International Media Award. | Navigacion postimi<br/><br/>"Jeta pa dokumente" fiton çmimin më të mirë të shkrimit<br/><br/>Blog projekt, “Jeta pa dokumente”, i krijuar nga Len Grant-i, përmban tregime të familjeve të padokumentuara migruese dhe të rinjve.Emigrantët e padokumentuar nuk kanë asgjë për të punuar, nuk kanë të drejtë për përfitime shtetërore dhe as për një vend për të jetuar.

| Sabbath School Lesson<br/><br/>In Galatians, Paul tackles issues such as freedom, the role of the law in salvation, our condition in Christ, and the nature of the Spirit-led life, as well as the age-old question, How can sinful humans be made right before a holy and just God?<br/><br/>Many scholars believe that Galatians may be the earliest of Paul's letters. It was written in A.D. 49, shortly after the famous Jerusalem Council (Acts 15). Therefore, the book may be the oldest Christian document known. As Acts and Galatians make clear, the early church found itself in a fierce battle over the nature of salvation, especially in the case of Gentiles. According to a group of Jewish believers, known as Judaizers, belief in Jesus alone was not good enough for Gentiles. Gentiles must also be circumcised and follow the laws of Moses (Acts 15:1).<br/><br/>This quarter's Bible study guide invites us to journey with the apostle Paul as he pleads with the Galatians to remain true to Jesus. It also gives us a chance to reflect on our own understanding of the truths that opened the way for Martin Luther's ultimate break with Rome and the restoration of the biblical gospel. | Shkolla e së shtunës Mësimi<br/><br/>Në Galatasve, Pali trajton çështje të tilla si liria, roli i ligjit në shpëtim, gjendja jonë në Krisht dhe natyra e jetës së udhëhequr nga Fryma, si dhe pyetja e lashtë: Si mund të bëhen njerëzit mëkatarë pikërisht para Perëndisë së Shenjtë dhe të drejtë?<br/><br/>Shumë studiues besojnë se Galatasve mund të jenë shkronjat më të hershme të Palit. Ai u shkrua në vitin 49 pas Këshillit të famshëm të Jeruzalemit (15). Prandaj, libri mund të jetë dokumenti më i vjetër i krishterë i njohur. Ndërsa aktet dhe Galatasve e bëjnë të qartë, kisha e hershme u gjend në një betejë të ashpër mbi natyrën e shpëtimit, veçanërisht në rastin e johebrenjve. Sipas një grupi besimtarësh judenj, të njohur si judaj, besimi në Jezusin vetëm nuk ishte mjaft i mirë për johebrenjtë, gjithashtu duhet të rrethpriten paganët dhe të ndjekin ligjet e Moisiut (Veprat e Apostujve 15:1).<br/><br/>Ky studim biblik na fton të udhëtojmë me apostullin Pavël ndërsa i lutet Galatasve që t’i qëndrojnë besnikë Jezusit. Gjithashtu na jep shansin të reflektojmë për të kuptuar të vërtetat që hapën rrugën për pushimin përfundimtar të Martin Luterit me Romën dhe restaurimin e ungjillit biblik. |

| Follow Us<br/><br/>ARE YOU AN<br/><br/>INSIDER<br/><br/>Craving Sugar? Here's What Your Body Is Trying to Tell You<br/><br/>by<br/>Byrdie<br/><br/>PHOTO:<br/><br/>Jacquemus<br/><br/>Weight gain from out-of-control cravings aside, it can be frustrating to have a constant hankering for something unhealthy and not know why. The good news is that there's usually a reason underlying that burning desire to house a bag of potato chips, or the feeling that you might actually die if you don't get a pickle rightthisinstant (even though you're not pregnant). If you're having visions of Milky Way bars, for example, it could mean that you're missing a very specific nutrient in your diet. (Yup—it's more complicated than said chocolate bar being so darn delicious.)<br/><br/>We talked to Los Angeles–based dietitian Shira Lenchewski, M.S., R.D., to get the skinny on some common food cravings, as well as what you can do to satiate the hunger without going overboard. Keep scrolling for some seriously good information!<br/><br/>If you're craving chocolate<br/><br/>It means: You could be lacking magnesium in your diet, says Lenchewski. "Magnesium is an essential mineral involved in energy production, glucose metabolism, and muscle function. This is especially true for those hitting the gym hard," she explains. Additionally, magnesium levels lower during the pre-menstrual weeks of your period, which explains why PMS so often comes with chocolate cravings.<br/><br/>Instead, reach for high-quality, low-sugar dark chocolate, which is naturally high in magnesium. "I recommend sticking to 75 per cent cocoa or higher, and pairing it with another magnesium-rich source like sunflower seeds," says Lenchewski. She suggests the chocolate brand Hu, a small-batch food company that focuses on high-quality ingredients produced locally. "It's a little pricey, but all the more reason to keep portions in check," she says. "It's my personal favourite." We're also big fans of superfood-packed Zenbunni.<br/><br/>If you're craving candy<br/><br/>It means: "Craving pure sugar is a good indication that you're running low on energy," says Lenchewski. "Think about it. What is the one thing you're itching for after a terrible night's sleep or at around 4 p.m. during a stressful workday? The answer is usually sugar because it's used as instant fuel for our body's cells."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for apples with nut butter. "If you're raiding your co-workers' candy stash, I recommend a more slow-burn carbohydrate with a source of fat or protein," says Lenchewski. "Unlike simple sugar, this will fuel your cells while avoiding the post-sugar crash. Two options that make for great pick-me-ups the next time you're craving candy: a sliced apple with your choice of nut butter, or berries with 2% unsweetened Greek yoghurt." We like quashing a sweet tooth with these addictive coconut chips, too—they're filling, free of any added sugar, and just so good.<br/><br/>If you're craving salt<br/><br/>It means: "If nothing but the saltiest pickle will do, you may not be drinking enough H2O," says Lenchewski. "Salt helps the body hold on to water, so we crave it when we're in need of fluids."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for water. "Stay hydrated, especially as we approach the summer months," she says. The next time a craving hits, try quenching it (literally) with a few refreshing glasses and you might find the urgency to sodium binge disappears. "If plain water bores you, try adding in mint, lemon, or frozen fruit to mix it up," says Lenchewski. And if that still doesn't do the trick, there's a healthier alternative to bagged chips or fries. "If you're really just craving salt after all, toasted seaweed is a great low-calorie option," she says.<br/><br/>If you're craving starchy carbs like pasta<br/><br/>It means: "Because high-carb foods boost the feel-good hormone serotonin, starch cravings can be a sign you're in need of a mood booster," says Lenchewski.<br/><br/>Instead, reach for a bath! "Bust out the Epsom salts, because it's time for some serious R+R," says Lenchewski. "Trust me. Indulging in a starch free-for-all feels really good in the moment, but it will likely bum you out more the next day." (As anyone who has ever over-indulged a pizza or pasta craving knows.) So the next time you want to dive head first into a bowl of carbs, draw a bath, light a candle, and treat yourself without any regret or dense calories.<br/><br/>If you're craving ice cream<br/><br/>5 / 6<br/><br/>It means: "Your body may be telling you it's in need of some healthy fat."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for coconut ice cream. "I'm a realist, so if you're craving ice cream, I'm not going to recommend a handful of walnuts, which are, of course, full of healthy fat," says Lenchewski. "For ice cream emergencies, I recommend lower-in-sugar coconut ice-creams like Coconut Bliss or Kippy's three-ingredient ice cream in Los Angeles." We can vouch for the fact that coconut ice cream tastes incredible and just like the real thing.<br/><br/>If you're craving a burger<br/><br/>It means: You need iron. "If you can't stop thinking about red meat, there's a chance your body is craving iron, b12 and folic acid," says Lenchewski. "This is especially true during or around that time of the month."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for a healthier burger. "I'm a proponent of grass fed, antibiotic and hormone-free red meat once a week," says Lenchewski. "Try experimenting with an open-faced bison burger—which, cut for cut, is leaner and has more iron than beef." Don't eat meat? Try to incorporate some kind of plant-based iron supplement into your routine, like spirulina. | Na ndiqni<br/><br/>Je NJË<br/><br/>I brendshëm<br/><br/>Sheqer Mall? Këtu është Ajo që Trupi Juaj është duke u Përpjekur të Ju Tregojnë<br/><br/>nga<br/>Byrdie<br/><br/>FOTO:<br/><br/>Jacquemus<br/><br/>Pesha e fituar nga dëshirat jashtë kontrollit mënjanë, ajo mund të jetë zhgënjyese që të ketë një hakerim të vazhdueshëm për diçka të pashëndetshme dhe të mos e di pse. Lajm i mirë është se zakonisht ka një arsye themelore që djegia e dëshirës për të mbajtur një qese me patate të skuqura, ose ndjenja që ju në fakt mund të vdesin në qoftë se ju nuk merrni një turshinë e djathtë (edhe pse ju nuk jeni shtatzënë). Nëse keni vizione për Rrugën e Qumështit, për shembull, mund të nënkuptojë se jeni duke humbur një lëndë ushqyese shumë specifike në dietën tuaj.<br/><br/>Folëm me dietologun me bazë në Los Anxheles Shira Lenchewski, M.S., R.D., për të pasur lëkurën në disa dëshira ushqimore të zakonshme, si dhe atë që mund të bëni për të ngopur urinë pa dalë jashtë bordit.<br/><br/>Nëse ju jeni mall çokollatë<br/><br/>Kjo do të thotë: Ju mund të keni mungesë të magnezit në dietën tuaj, thotë Lenchewski. "Magniumi është një mineral thelbësor i përfshirë në prodhimin e energjisë, metabolizmin e glukozës dhe funksionin e muskujve.Kjo është veçanërisht e vërtetë për ata që goditin palestrën fort", shpjegon ajo. Përveç kësaj, nivelet e magnezit janë më të ulëta gjatë javëve para menstruacioneve të periudhës suaj, gjë që shpjegon pse PMS shpesh vjen me dëshirat e çokollatës.<br/><br/>Në vend të kësaj, arrini te çokollata e zezë me cilësi të lartë, me sheqer të ulët, e cila është natyrisht e lartë në magnez. "Unë rekomandoj ngjitje në 75 përqind të kakaos ose më e lartë dhe duke e çiftuar atë me një burim tjetër të pasur magnezi si farat e lulediellit", - thotë Lenchewski. Ajo sugjeron markën e çokollatës Hu, një kompani ushqimore e vogël që fokusohet në përbërës të cilësisë së lartë të prodhuar në vend. "Kjo është një çmim i vogël, por të gjitha arsyet më shumë për të mbajtur pjesë në kontroll," thotë ajo. Ne jemi gjithashtu tifozë të mëdha të mbiushqim ushqim të paketuara Zenbunni.<br/><br/>Nëse ju jeni mall karamele<br/><br/>Dëshira e sheqerit të pastër është një tregues i mirë se po vraponi poshtë në energji," thotë Lenchewski. "Mendoni për këtë.Cila është ajo që po kruhet për një gjumë të tmerrshëm ose rreth orës 4 të mëngjesit gjatë një dite stresuese pune? Përgjigja është zakonisht sheqeri sepse përdoret si lëndë djegëse e menjëhershme për qelizat e trupit tonë."<br/><br/>Në vend të kësaj, arrini te mollët me gjalpë arre. "Nëse jeni duke bastisur fijen e karameleve të kolegëve tuaj, ju rekomandoj një karbohidrate më të ngadaltë me një burim dhjami ose proteinash", thotë Lenchewski. Ndryshe nga sheqeri i thjeshtë, kjo do të furnizojë qelizat tuaja ndërsa shmangni rrëzimin pas sheqerit. Dy opsione që bëjnë për mua-më-ups të madh herën tjetër që ju jeni mall karamele: një mollë feta me zgjedhjen tuaj të gjalpë arrë, ose manaferrat me kos grek 2% unsweetened." Na pëlqen të kemi një dhëmb të ëmbël me këto çipa kokosi vartës, edhe ata po plotësojnë, pa ndonjë sheqer të shtuar, dhe vetëm kaq të mirë.<br/><br/>Nëse ju jeni mall kripë<br/><br/>Kjo do të thotë: "Nëse nuk do të bëjë asgjë tjetër, ju nuk mund të pini mjaft H2O," thotë Lenchewski. "Kririni ndihmon trupin të mbajë në ujë, kështu që ne e dëshirojmë atë kur jemi në nevojë për lëngje."<br/><br/>Në vend të kësaj, arrijnë për ujë: "Rrini të hidratuar, veçanërisht kur i afrohemi muajve të verës", thotë ajo. Herën tjetër një mallëzon, provoni ta shuani (fjalë për fjalë) me disa gota freskuese dhe mund të gjeni urgjencën për të zhdukur ndjesitë e verës së natriumit. Nëse uji i thjeshtë ju mërzit, provoni të shtoni në nenexhik, limon ose fruta të ngrira për ta përzier atë," thotë Lenchewski.Dhe nëse kjo ende nuk e bën mashtrim, ka një alternativë më të shëndetshme për patate të skuqura ose patate të skuqura thes. Nëse jeni me të vërtetë vetëm mall për kripën në fund të fundit, algat e pjekura është një opsion i madh me kalori të ulëta," thotë ajo.<br/><br/>Nëse ju jeni mall carbs starchy si makarona<br/><br/>Kjo do të thotë: "Sepse ushqimet me karbohidrate të larta rrisin serotoninën e hormoneve të ndjenjës së mirë, dëshirat e nisjes mund të jenë një shenjë që keni nevojë për një përforcues humori", thotë Lenchewski.<br/><br/>Në vend të kësaj, shkoni për një banjë! "Huaj nga kripërat Epsom, sepse është koha për disa R + R serioze," thotë Lenchewski. "Më besoni., kënaquni në një fillim të lirë për të gjithë ndihet vërtet mirë në këtë moment, por ka të ngjarë t'ju dërrmojë më shumë ditën tjetër." (Sikurse dikush që ka mbingarkuar një pizza apo pasta mall di) Kështu që herën tjetër që ju doni të zhyteni kokë së pari në një tas me karbohidrate, të vizatoni një banjë, të ndezni një qiri, të trajtoni veten pa asnjë keqardhje apo kalori të dendura.<br/><br/>Nëse ju jeni mall akullore<br/><br/>5 / 6<br/><br/>Do të thotë: "Trupi juaj mund t'ju tregojë se ka nevojë për një yndyrë të shëndetshme."<br/><br/>Në vend të kësaj, arrij te kremi i akullit të kokosit, "Unë jam realist, kështu që nëse dëshironi akullore, nuk do të rekomandoj një grusht arrash, të cilat janë, natyrisht, plot yndyrë të shëndetshme," thotë Lenchewski. "Për emergjencat e akullores, unë rekomandoj akullore me arra kokosi të ulët ose me tre përbërës të kozmetikës në Los Anxhelos".Ne mund të kërkojmë për faktin se kremi i kokosit me akull ka shije të pabesueshme dhe ashtu si sendi i vërtetë.<br/><br/>Nëse jeni mall për një burger<br/><br/>Kjo do të thotë: Ju duhet hekur. "Nëse nuk mund të ndaloni së menduari për mishin e kuq, ka një shans që trupi juaj të mallëzohet me hekur, b12 dhe acid folik", thotë Lenchewski. "Kjo është veçanërisht e vërtetë gjatë ose rreth asaj kohe të muajit."<br/><br/>Në vend të kësaj, arrini një Burger më të shëndetshëm. "Unë jam një përkrahës i mishit të kuq të barit, antibiotik dhe hormonal një herë në javë", thotë Lenchewski. "Provoni të eksperimentoni me një burger bison me fytyrë të hapur - i cili, prerë, është më i butë dhe ka më shumë hekur se viçi." Mos hani mish? Mundohuni të përfshini disa lloj suplementi hekuri me bazë bimore në rutinën tuaj, si spirulina. |

| Web Services, Vendors And Cyber Laws!<br/><br/>Updated On:April 21, 2014Bilal Ahmad<br/><br/>Computerization of this world changed human performance scenario to a great extent and that too beyond measurement. For instance, Now you can send vital information all across the globe with a single mouse click, thanks to internet connectivity. Sadly, it is this wide connectivity and popularity among people, internet has also increased chances for computer crimes. Internet crimes or computer crimes are widely known as 'Cyber Crimes'.<br/><br/>'Cyber Laws' is something new in the judiciary system but has gained a lot of attention lately. The term cyber crime is something very synonymous with conventional crime, the only difference being medium of execution. There are majorly two types of cyber crimes, the first one is in which computers are the main targets and these include cases of data damage, malicious code and even criminal data access. The second one is in which computer is only a tool using which conventional crimes are committed for eg cyber terrorism, spamming, cyber stalking and many more.<br/><br/>This is where a website consultant or a vendor comes into scene. Although not aware of all the cyber laws present till date, a website vendor can advise you on some of the most vital cyber laws while creating your site.<br/><br/>This may include common knowledge of copy rights or even protecting the content of your own website. Explaining you all the rights you posses as a website owner is also one the tasks a website vendor may do while developing your website. A vendor can also assist you by offering you information on different cyber laws to protect data. Besides all of this, a vendor can also offer you information on any new cyber law that you may not be aware of till know. Cyber laws may vary from nation to nation, one recent example can be of the cookie law released in the United Kingdom, which prevents the website from saving any user browsing data. As per the Cookie Law, websites in the United Kingdom cannot save cookie files without informational consent from the surfer.<br/><br/>It is after the implementation of such law, websites now have a pop-up window, which seeks the consent of the visitor for saving cookies files. Such files are used by websites to analyze the browsing pattern of visitors based on which advertisements are then posted on a user window. With hacking not anymore a new thing for all of us, do you think such rules and regulations can prevent online forgery or cyber crime? Technology has developed at a rapid rate but still people do not prefer shopping online due to fear of personal or bank account details getting hacked. With the rise of cyber crime, need of stringent cyber laws have also increased to curb the same and to promote a risk free shopping experience.<br/><br/>Classes of Cyber Crimes<br/><br/>Over the years there have been three major classes of cyber crimes:<br/><br/>Unauthorized access of computer system cases, which involves hacking or stealing usernames and passwords to gain access over personal information of the respective user. These kind of backdoor access are organized with the help of Trojan Horse. Releasing malicious programs like Trojan House, worms or computer viruses etc. The last class includes cyber stalking a user or online harassment .<br/><br/>Direct implications of Cyber crimes<br/><br/>Decrease in sales<br/><br/>Decrease in staff output due to network delays<br/><br/>Loss of personalized information like research work<br/><br/>Disruption in communication process<br/><br/>Indirect implications of Cyber crimes<br/><br/>Credibility issue in our financial system<br/><br/>Brand image is tarnished in the market<br/><br/>Cyber crimes affect business to business relationship in the market<br/><br/>Sense of trust in state policies and government agencies is lost<br/><br/>Preventing Cyber Crime<br/><br/>As netizens there are certain precautions that we should consider for a safe and secure online experience. Here are some of them:<br/><br/>First thing to do will be to keep personal information to your self and avoid sharing the same online.<br/><br/>Avoid sharing any photographs with online chat friends or strangers.<br/><br/>Installing latest version of anti-virus on your system can offer you a good line of defense against internet threats like viruses and malware.<br/><br/>Keeping back up of your valuable data is a good option to avoid problems like virus contamination.<br/><br/>Avoid sending credit card information to sites that are unsecured and don't have any valid certificate.<br/><br/>Installing safety programme that offers you control over site cookies and saves you from being tracked by websites.<br/><br/>Putting host-based intrusions detection devices on servers will help you keep track of irregularities on your website traffic.<br/><br/>Use of firewall is advised.<br/><br/>Why Cyber attacks are so popular?<br/><br/>Cheaper than traditional cheating methods<br/><br/>Tracking cyber crimes are not easy<br/><br/>Exact locations cannot be tracked easily<br/><br/>Absence of physical barrier in the internet world<br/><br/>Cyber crimes affect large number of people<br/><br/>Conclusion<br/><br/>The fact that human mind has unfathomable power is undeniable, which is why internet crimes are increasing at a tremendous rate. Even history has witnessed some of the greatest internet security gone kaput by the hands of hackers, who have easily got away too. The only way to curb such crime is to remain aware of the cyber laws that we have today, that can either be through internet or through website/IT vendors. Information Technology Act has to be balanced in such a way that it proves too stringent for people who are involved in cyber crimes and at the same time it should never hamper the growth of Internet industry.<br/><br/>Author Bio:– Maneet Puri at present is heading a quality web design firm located at New Delhi, India.

Për fat të keq, është kjo lidhje dhe popullaritet i gjerë në mesin e njerëzve, interneti ka rritur gjithashtu shanset për krime kompjuterike.Krimet në internet ose krimet kompjuterike njihen gjerësisht si 'Krimet Kibernetike'.<br/><br/>'Ligjet kibernetike' është diçka e re në sistemin gjyqësor, por ka fituar shumë vëmendje kohët e fundit. Termi krim kibernetik është diçka shumë sinonim me krimin konvencional, i vetmi ndryshim i të qenit medium i ekzekutimit. Ekzistojnë kryesisht dy lloje krimesh kibernetike, e para është në të cilat kompjuterët janë objektivat kryesore dhe këto përfshijnë rastet e dëmtimit të të dhënave, kodit me qëllim të keq dhe madje edhe qasjen në të dhëna kriminale. E dyta është në të cilën kompjuteri është vetëm një mjet që përdor se cilat krime konvencionale janë të përkushtuara për p.sh. terrorizmi kibernetik, spamming, përndjekje kibernetike dhe shumë më tepër.<br/><br/>Kjo është ajo ku një konsulent në internet ose një shitës vjen në skenë., Edhe pse nuk është në dijeni të të gjitha ligjeve kibernetike të pranishme deri më sot, një shitës i faqes në internet mund t'ju këshillojë në disa nga ligjet më vitale kibernetike duke krijuar faqen tuaj.<br/><br/>Kjo mund të përfshijë njohuri të përbashkëta për të drejtat e kopjimit ose edhe për mbrojtjen e përmbajtjes së faqes suaj të internetit. Shpjegimi i të gjitha të drejtave që posedoni si pronar i një faqe interneti është gjithashtu një nga detyrat që një shitës i faqes në internet mund të bëjë gjatë zhvillimit të faqes tuaj të internetit. Një shitës mund t'ju ndihmojë gjithashtu duke ju ofruar informacion mbi ligje të ndryshme kibernetike për të mbrojtur të dhënat.Përveç kësaj, një tregtar gjithashtu mund t'ju ofrojë informacion mbi çdo ligj të ri kibernetik që mund të mos jeni në dijeni deri në dijeni. Ligjet kibernetike mund të ndryshojnë nga një komb në vend, një shembull i fundit mund të jetë i ligjit të cookie-ve të lëshuar në Mbretërinë e Bashkuar, i cili pengon faqen e internetit të ruajë ndonjë të dhënë të shfletimit të përdoruesit. Sipas Ligjit për Cookie, faqet e internetit në Mbretërinë e Bashkuar nuk mund të ruajnë skedarë cookie pa pëlqimin informativ nga surferi.<br/><br/>Pas zbatimit të këtij ligji, faqet e internetit tani kanë një dritare kërcyese, e cila kërkon pëlqimin e vizitorit për të ruajtur skedarët e cookie-ve. Skedarët e tillë përdoren nga faqet e internetit për të analizuar modelin e shfletimit të vizitorëve bazuar në të cilat reklama më pas postohen në një dritare përdoruesi. Me hakerët nuk është më një gjë e re për të gjithë ne, a mendoni se rregullat dhe rregulloret e tilla mund të parandalojnë falsifikimin në internet ose krimin kibernetik? Teknologjia është zhvilluar me shpejtësi, por njerëzit ende nuk preferojnë të blejnë në internet për shkak të frikës nga detajet e llogarisë personale ose bankare duke u hakuar. Me rritjen e krimit kibernetik, nevoja e ligjeve kibernetike të rrepta janë rritur gjithashtu për të frenuar të njëjtën gjë dhe për të promovuar një përvojë të blerjes falas të rrezikut.<br/><br/>Klasat e Krimeve Kibernetike<br/><br/>Gjatë viteve ka pasur tre klasa kryesore të krimeve kibernetike:<br/><br/>Qasja e paautorizuar e rasteve të sistemit kompjuterik, e cila përfshin ruajtjen e përdoruesve dhe fjalëkalimet për të fituar qasje në informacionin personal të përdoruesit përkatës.Këto lloj hyrje backdoor janë organizuar me ndihmën e Trojan Horse.
