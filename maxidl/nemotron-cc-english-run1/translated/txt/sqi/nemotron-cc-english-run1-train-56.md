| While acknowledging that it's impossible to argue someone into loving something they hate, and vice versa, it's still often enjoyable to attempt the argument. When we talk to people whose opinions directly contradict ours, we're forced to defend our tastes, define our opinions, and analyze why we react the way we do. Which is why we have Why Don't You Like This?, in which two of our staffers will attempt to discover whether people with opposing opinions can get beyond "No, you're wrong!" and have a civil, constructive, and possibly even convincing discussion about their points of contention. Because no matter what talk radio says, there's still a middle ground between "We agree utterly" and "I'm right, and you're stupid and evil."<br/><br/>Scott: Since discussing my Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World apostasy, we've been looking for a case where I can call you out for not liking something wonderful, and we didn't have to look for long. We were sitting right next to each other during Martin Scorsese's Hugo—me, utterly enchanted by its fantastical tribute to the wonders of early silent cinema, and you, apparently resisting it at every turn. Critical consensus has been on my side: It hit the No. 9 spot on our collective Top 15 (though you listed it as your Overrated choice), has won (or placed) in various film-critic awards, and currently enjoys an 83 score on Metacritic. That doesn't mean you're wrong, of course, but the onus is on you to explain why Hugo was, in your words, "hollow and artificial," where many of us saw it as a lovely evocation of Scorsese's childhood and the medium when it was still in its infancy. And please be gentle as you rip this butterfly apart by the wings.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Tasha: I can't be gentle, Scott. Sometimes it hurts less if you rip the Band-Aid off all at once. (And even if it doesn't, who wants to walk around wearing a half-ripped-off Band-Aid? Gross.) The fact is, I found Hugo to be a wearyingly manipulative exercise in fakery, starting from its opening glide through a Paris train station, which reminded me more than anything of Robert Zemeckis' The Polar Express. Unlike Mike D'Angelo, I'm a fan of long, unbroken takes as a way of establishing a space and encouraging viewers to unconsciously hold their breaths as a camera explores an area; but when the space being explored is a slick, shiny CGI creation, and the camera floats weightlessly through it with no physical sense that either the camera or the surroundings are really there, that exploration starts to feel like watching someone else play a videogame. And the rest of the film felt similarly poreless and unreal to me, both in terms of its setting and in terms of its highly contrived, maudlin story.<br/><br/>I don't necessarily have a problem with manufactured, stylized environments in film. I loved Baz Luhrmann's equally sprawling, utterly artificial take on Paris in Moulin Rouge, for instance, but that film has a sense of its own ridiculousness, a sense of humor about how deliberately over-the-top it is. Ditto the stylization of Jean-Pierre Jeunet, particularly in Amélie. (Both Jeunet and Luhrmann felt like strong visual influences here.) I got the sense, however, that Martin Scorsese wanted me to take Hugo entirely seriously. Even though it's yet another achingly sentimental story about a plucky orphan bringing color back into the life of a grumpy old curmudgeon. And I just couldn't.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>There is nothing I enjoy more in film than being surprised. And there's nothing I resent and resist more than being overtly manipulated, being loudly told what to feel and when to feel it. A good film does this kind of thing subtly; a bad one uses crashing music cues and sweet strings—and in this case, a grubby, huge-eyed, disheveled orphan staring woefully at the camera—to demand pathos, and to tell viewers they're horrible people if they don't serve it up on demand. That said, I can deal with sad kids and grumpy adults making life better for each other—I really dug this year's Le Havre, which was essentially the same plot without all the cutesiness—but I find the artificial environments reflect badly on the artificial emotions, and each makes the other seem more fake by turns.<br/><br/>Let's start with that. In our overlooked films video, you and Noel both took Keith to task for championing Tyrannosaur, because you felt it wasn't realistic enough—too contrived, too miserablist, too much, too far. How is it possible that you can't buy a stymied old crank who breaks things when he's angry, but you can buy an orphan living inside a giant train-station clock and embarking upon a whimsical journey to repair a mysterious automaton that he believes might bear secrets from his dead father, but which instead leads him on a quirky voyage of self-discovery, into the magical land of cinema? Did you never find Hugo's gaudy rococo design, aggressive heartstring-plucking, or wheelbarrow-loads of quirk even a little excessive or hard to swallow?<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Scott: Jeunet and Luhrmann as influences on Scorsese?! Forget being indelicate, now you're deliberately poking me with a sharp stick. If you're looking for inspirations for Hugo—indeed, if you're looking for the emotional core of Hugo—you have to go back to Scorsese's childhood on Elizabeth Street in Little Italy, where an asthmatic little boy, unable to play outside with the other kids, retreated to Alexander Korda fantasies like The Thief Of Bagdad. Or, more simply, just go straight to the source himself: George Méliès, whose A Trip To The Moon remains the Big Bang of all cinematic fantasies, that moment when the camera was not used to document the world as it is, but whatever whimsical, magical, transporting place a filmmaker wants to invent for it. And that tradition has been developed and expanded upon for decades before the likes of Jeunet and Luhrmann got their grubby little paws on it.<br/><br/>And speaking of Jeunet, nice attempt to take away my rhetorical weapon, but I'll say it anyway: How can you love Amélie, yet find Hugo synthetic and "excessive" and "wearyingly manipulative"? You say that Amélie and Moulin Rouge have redeeming "sense of [their] own ridiculousness" where Scorsese means us to take Hugo seriously, and I don't think that's the case, at least on the latter point. That Scorsese feels evident passion about the movies is, I suppose, why you'd interpret Hugo as self-serious. But to me, it's those feelings that give the film an emotional ballast that the Luhrmann and Jeunet films don't have. All three films make aggressive use of the marvels of CGI—and Scorsese adds 3D to the mix, to wonderful effect—but where you and I differ is on the issue of weightlessness. I agree that CGI has a distancing effect; worlds composed entirely of digital plasticine are flexible to the point where they sometimes have no presence. You referred to Hugo in your "Overrated" entry for our Best Of Film piece as "a CGI gimcrack"—a perfect dis… for another movie.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>It's fair to say that Scorsese has built Hugo around a standard-issue, "heartstring-plucking" children's book/movie plot: Orphan misses his daddy, creates his own little fantasy world, gloms onto a new friend, convinces a crusty old fuddy-duddy to soften up and maybe adopt him. But that's just the narrative skeleton, and Scorsese provides plenty of flesh and blood. For one, you can't watch Hugo, the lonely boy, peering out from clock towers to the hustle-and-bustle of a Paris train station without thinking of Scorsese, another lonely boy, staring out of his bedroom window on Elizabeth Street. And even if you're not a big enough film nerd to make that connection, I really feel like Hugo's journey is not in finding a new father figure, but in persisting with the mechanical magic that stands as his own father's legacy. That's what film is: The persistence of vision that allows us to accept an illusory version of the world at 24 frames per second is science and magic at once. Hugo's relationship with Méliès isn't about him cozying up to a new daddy, but sharing a common enthusiasm the old man has submerged in bitterness. To me, that's a far more unique angle on a potentially shopworn premise.<br/><br/>Did you really find none of Hugo enchanting? Even the film's few detractors seem willing to admit that the sequences evoking cinema history and Méliès' studio—with Michael Stuhlbarg as the heroic film scholar!—were terrific. It felt, in the best possible way, like a heady compression of my History Of Film 101 class in college, condensing a semester's worth of clips and context into something between a montage and an animated pop-up book. And it speaks to the ingenious design of the film, which layers fact and fantasy so beautifully that it's at once a history of Méliès and the birth of cinema, and just the sort of simple, sumptuously produced cinematic wonder that Scorsese himself would have loved as a child. Thank goodness Hugo doesn't follow the Jeunet/Luhrmann model and have "a sense of its own ridiculousness." As a fantasy connoisseur yourself, wouldn't you say there's value in playing it straight and earnest and unabashed rather than winking at the audience? You may find Hugo sickly sweet, but I don't think the authenticity of its sentiment is to be denied.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Tasha: Yes, I did in fact find parts of Hugo enchanting. (Notice how I'm answering your question up front, whereas you were too busy frothing with apoplexy to address mine, though I assume that's an answer in its own right. Okay, "influence" may be overstating the case—I just meant the visual style looked very familiar. Though as Keith pointed out when you brought this up in person, Scorsese is neither opposed to drawing inspiration from other people's visuals, nor immune to it.) Primarily, I was enchanted by the parts dealing with Georges Méliès' backstory, with his love of cinema, with the work he put into his art and the joy he got out of it. There's an awful lot of beauty and fun in the staging of the underwater-court scene from Méliès' "Fairyland," and in the sequence at the end, focusing on Méliès footage. I'll grant you that Hugo's connection with Méliès over a shared love of film is a nice touch. And I do enjoy a good film about filmmaking.<br/><br/>But Hugo isn't primarily about film, in spite of the Méliès tie-ins. In addition to the themes you cite, it's also about finding your purpose, as the characters expressly, laboriously explain to each other and to us. And it's about spectacle, and big action setpieces, and chases, and happily-ever-after endings where even the angry bully and the shy older couple and fergawdsakes even the cranky dachshund all get paired off with charming love interests by the end. It's about the super-precocious Hermione Granger-type being bossy and perky and clever and praising the magical worlds encased in books. And all of this business is mighty familiar, and mighty artificial.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Yes, Scorsese is playing with archetypes. Problem is, I never felt he imbued them with anything new, fresh, or believable, in spite of his own backstory. I would have much preferred a story about a young Scorsese growing up with asthma—something small-scale and real, without vast rooms full of CGI clockwork and golden glowing dust-motes and prophetic dreams and a raging adult tyrant-guard with a heart of gold—all of that outsized, over-the-top nonsense. You keep citing Scorsese's personal background and love of film as evidence that he's really feeling what he's putting on the screen, but I don't feel his personal touch in any of this, except the moments that are expressly about film. The core emotions may be real, but that doesn't make the execution less false.<br/><br/>You say the authenticity of the emotion isn't to be denied. I don't question whether Scorsese personally felt lonely and isolated as a child, but I don't feel loneliness and isolation on the screen—I see a bunch of exaggerated signifiers (Hugo is filthy and his clothes are worn and all the adults yell at him and he regularly gets chased by a scary dog!) and big beats, with shouting and weeping and Spielbergian wonder-emoting. For me, sincerity is more convincing and more personal when it's quiet and direct; when someone's shouting his opinions at me, I assume he's either really angry, or just trying to overwhelm my senses to keep me from expressing my own opinion. Hugo was one long shout, as far as I was concerned.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Why didn't I get that sense of fakery from Amélie, you ask? Actually, I did. I'll completely acknowledge that Amélie and Moulin Rouge are both big, manipulative, artificial constructions in the exact same vein, demanding specific emotions at specific intervals, and trying to sell those emotions with heavy emoting and aggressive soundtrack prodding. Neither of them really sold me on their emotions as authentic human feeling. What I enjoyed in those two films was the construction—particularly Amélie's heady, laughable lists of random characterizing features and experiences for its cast, and Moulin Rouge's musical-magpie mashups and recontextualizations. I'm often sold on stories that do creative or ambitious things with structure, and both of those movies qualify, where Hugo is a much more linear, standard kid-quest.<br/><br/>But in the end, for me, it really does come down to a feeling that those movies are goofs, whereas Hugo is meant to be taken seriously at every treacly moment. You don't think that's true—but you're simultaneously defending its integrity in terms of its absolutely authentic, rooted-in-Scorsese's-history emotion, and telling me I'm wrong, and he doesn't mean it to be taken seriously. How do you reconcile those two statements? What about the film suggests to you that it isn't meant to be taken at face value? And is it possible this is just another Curious Case Of Benjamin Button-like situation where I find the use of kids in big-budget films to be largely sappy and melodramatic, whereas you as a dad find it bypasses your cynicism and goes straight to your family-feeling?<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Scott: Not sure I meant that Scorsese doesn't mean to be taken seriously; it's just that he's chosen a whimsical vehicle through which to express a serious love of the movies. When you say, "But Hugo isn't primarily about film, in spite of the Méliès tie-ins," I'm mystified. I grant that you find many elements of Hugo overly familiar and laborious and full of Spielbergian wonder-emoting—there's nothing I can do to argue around that perception, which other Hugo doubters share. Sometimes a film means to charm and enchant, and it doesn't for some; you've got Hugo and I've got Amélie, though I think the latter, deliberately artificial as it is, means for us to find it romantic. (Rather than, say, some horrible mechanical contraption fit for a Saw sequel.)<br/><br/>But to say Hugo isn't primarily about film? If it's not about film, then it's the most pointlessly discursive story about [whatever you think it's about] I've ever seen. The relationship between Hugo and Méliès is the heart of the movie, and at the heart of that is not just some stock connection between Plucky Orphan and Crusty Old Guy With A Heart Of Gold, but a shared affinity for engineered magic—specifically the magic of the movies. I think Scorsese and his collaborators have found a way to express their enthusiasm over the early days of cinema through a fantasy that's accessible to all ages. The archetype-filled children's tale is the merely the crust here; cinema is the pie. (Mmmm… pie.)<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>As for The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button, I don't see much of a connection, other than trying to expose me as a Benjamin Button defender as a way of damaging my credibility. (Incidentally, how are the extras on that G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra Blu-ray?) I've said to you that the sleep-deprived new dad in me was perhaps vulnerable to Benjamin Button, but I can't imagine a time when the premise of aging in reverse wouldn't move me. (Cradling the love of your life in your arms as an infant? How can you not be affected by that?) And besides, I don't see how Benjamin Button relates much to Hugo as a film concerning kids, since that's just a small segment of a story that spans a much larger trajectory.<br/><br/>So have I convinced you? Likely not. But I'm happy to learn that Hugo wasn't entirely devoid of enchantments for you. The sequences on Méliès the filmmaker are what put Hugo over for me—and in that, at least, we can share some movie love.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Tasha: Nope, I can't say you've convinced me, any more than I've convinced you. It's impossible to argue anyone into a visceral love of anything, and it really should be equally impossible to talk someone down from visceral love. Mostly, you've let me see Hugo in Scott-O-Vision, which is an interesting experience; at least now I'm mildly convinced that we didn't somehow manage to see entirely different films which both somehow had the same name and director.<br/><br/>We certainly had different experiences, though, and to my mind, focused on different aspects of the production: I still don't see the "film is marvelous" theme as the movie's single strand, so much as one among too many. "Pointlessly discursive" almost covers it, though I'd throw in "often needlessly cutesy and precious" on top of that. While you're focused on the film's tasty pie filling, I feel like that pie was covered with a pound of crystallized sugar, and I think that does make a difference, regardless of the film's core message or handful of terrific scenes. See also Benjamin Button, which I did not bring up just to chafe you—I really do think you have more of a sentimental streak than I do regarding children in cinema, especially when they're used more as symbols of vulnerability and innocence than as human characters. Hey, you know what film totally does not have cute wide-eyed moppets bringing hope to a cynical world? G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra. Maybe I will go watch those Blu-ray extras. I could use some explosion-insulin to compensate for Hugo's sweetness. | Ndërkohë që pranon se është e pamundur të argumentosh dikë që të duash diçka që e urrejnë, dhe anasjelltas, shpesh është e kënaqshme të provosh argumentin.

Sepse pa marrë parasysh çfarë thotë radioja, ka ende një terren të mesëm midis "Ne pajtohem krejtësisht" dhe "Unë jam e drejtë, dhe ju jeni budalla dhe të këqij."<br/><br/>Scott: Që nga diskutuar Scott Pilgrim Vs Bota, ne kemi qenë në kërkim për një rast ku unë mund të telefononi ju për të mos i pëlqen diçka e mrekullueshme, dhe ne nuk keni pasur për të kërkuar për kohë të gjatë.

Konsensusi kritik ka qenë në anën time: Ajo goditi vendin Nr. 9 në Topin tonë kolektiv (megjithëse e keni renditur atë si zgjedhjen tuaj të Overrated), ka fituar (ose vendosur) në çmime të ndryshme kritike të filmit, dhe aktualisht gëzon një rezultat 83 në Metacritic. Kjo nuk do të thotë që ju jeni gabim, sigurisht, por onusi është në ju për të shpjeguar pse Hugo ishte, në fjalët tuaja, "i zbrazët dhe artificiale", ku shumë prej nesh e panë atë si një evokim të bukur të fëmijërisë së Scorsese dhe mediumit kur ajo ishte ende në foshnjën e saj. Dhe ju lutem të jetë i butë si ju shqyej këtë flutur përveç nga krahët.<br/><br/>Reklama<br/><br/>Tasha: Nuk mund të jem i butë, Scott. Ndonjëherë dhemb më pak nëse e grisni band-ndihmën menjëherë. (Edhe nëse nuk e bën, kush dëshiron të ecë me veshje gjysmë të pjekur Band-Aid? Bruto.) Fakti është, kam gjetur Hugo të jetë një ushtrim i kujdesshëm manipulues në falsifikim, duke filluar nga rrëshqitjen e saj të hapur përmes një stacioni treni në Paris, i cili më kujtoi më shumë se çdo gjë të Robert Zemeckis' The Polar Express. Për dallim nga Mike D'Angelo, jam një adhurues i gjatë dhe i pashkëputur merr si një mënyrë për të krijuar një hapësirë dhe për të inkurajuar shikuesit që të mbajnë frymë pa vetëdije si një kamerë që eksploron një zonë; por kur hapësira që po eksplorohet është një krijim i shkëlqyeshëm i CGI-t dhe kamera noton pa peshë me asnjë kuptim fizik që ose kamera ose mjedisi rrethues nuk janë aty, ai eksplorim fillon të ndjehet sikur shikon dikë tjetër që luan një videolojë. Dhe pjesa tjetër e filmit, në mënyrë të ngjashme, ishte i pashpresë dhe joreale për mua, si në aspektin e vendosjes së tij ashtu edhe në aspektin e historisë së tij shumë të kurdisur të tij.<br/><br/>Nuk kam domosdoshmërisht problem me mjediset e prodhuara dhe të stilizuara në film. E dashurova njëlloj zvarritjen e Baz Luhrmann, marrjen krejtësisht artificiale në Paris në Moulin Rouge, për shembull, por ai film ka një ndjenjë qesharakesie të tij, një ndjenjë humori se sa qëllimisht është mbi krye të tij. Ditto stilistizimin e Jean-Pierre Jeunet, veçanërisht në Amélie. (Të dy Jeunet dhe Luhrmann ndiheshin si ndikime të forta vizuale këtu) kam marrë kuptimin, megjithatë, se Martin Scorsese donte që unë ta merrja Hugo krejtësisht seriozisht. Edhe pse është ende një histori tjetër domethënëse në lidhje me një jetim që e kthen ngjyrën në jetën e një cirkugjeni të vjetër të zymtë.<br/><br/>Reklama<br/><br/>Nuk ka asgjë që më pëlqen më shumë në film sesa të habitet., Dhe nuk ka asgjë që unë e duroj dhe rezistoj më shumë se sa të manipulohem haptazi, të them me zë të lartë se çfarë të ndjej dhe kur ta ndiej. Një film i mirë e bën këtë gjë më delikate; një film i keq përdor shenjat e muzikës që përplasen dhe vargjet e ëmbla—dhe në këtë rast, një shpend me sy të madh, i nxjerrë nga jetimët duke parë mirë në kamerë—për të kërkuar patos dhe për t’u treguar shikuesve se janë njerëz të tmerrshëm nëse nuk i shërbejnë kërkesës. Pavarësisht kësaj, unë mund të ballafaqohem me fëmijë të trishtuar dhe të rritur që e bëjnë jetën më të mirë për njëri-tjetrin—kam gërmuar për Le Havre-in e këtij viti, i cili në thelb ishte i njëjti komplot pa të gjithë cutenessin—por gjeta mjediset artificiale që reflektojnë keq mbi emocionet artificiale dhe secila e bën tjetrën të duket më e rreme nga kthesat.<br/><br/>Në videon tonë të filmave të vjetër, ju dhe Noeli të dy e morën Keith për detyrë që të përkrahnin Tyrannosour, sepse e ndjeva që nuk ishte mjaft realiste – shumë e kurdisur, shumë mizeralist, shumë larg. Si është e mundur që ju nuk mund të blejnë një manë e vjetër e shkatërruar që thyen gjërat kur ai është i zemëruar, por ju mund të blini një jetim që jetojnë brenda një orë gjigante të stacionit të trenit dhe hyn në një udhëtim çuditshëm për të riparuar një automat misterioz që ai beson se mund të mbajnë sekrete nga babai i tij i vdekur, por që në vend të kësaj e çon atë në një udhëtim të çuditshme të vetë-zbulimit, në vendin magjike të kinemasë? Nuk e keni gjetur kurrë dizajnin e lezetshëm të Hugo's roco, shtrëngimin e zemrës agresive, ose ngarkesat e quirk edhe pak të tepruara ose të vështira për t'u gëlltitur?<br/><br/>Reklama<br/><br/>Scott: Jeunet dhe Luhrmann si ndikim në Scorsese?! Harrojeni të qenit i pashlyeshëm, tani qëllimisht po më kërkon me një shkop të mprehtë. Nëse jeni duke kërkuar frymëzime për Hugo - në të vërtetë, nëse jeni duke kërkuar thelbin emocional të Hugo - duhet të ktheheni në fëmijërinë e Scorsese në Elizabeth Street në Little Italy, ku një djalë i vogël astmik, i paaftë për të luajtur jashtë me fëmijët e tjerë, u tërhoq në fantazitë e Alexander Korda si Theif Of Bagdad. Ose, më thjesht, thjesht shkoni drejtpërdrejt te vetë burimi: George Méliès, A Trip To the Moon mbetet Bangi i Madh i të gjitha fantazive kinematografike, ai moment kur kamera nuk u përdor për të dokumentuar botën siç është, por çfarëdo gjëje magjike, duke transportuar vendin një regjisor dëshiron të shpikë për të. Dhe kjo traditë është zhvilluar dhe zgjeruar për dekada të tëra përpara se i pëlqen Jeunet dhe Luhrman të merrnin putrat e tyre të vegjël me gjemba mbi të.<br/><br/>Dhe duke folur për Jeunet, përpjekje e bukur për të hequr armën time retorikë, por unë do të them atë gjithsesi: Si mund ta doni Amélie, ende të gjeni Hugo sintetike dhe "të tepruar" dhe "i kujdesshëm manipulues"? Ju thoni se Amélie dhe Moulin Rouge kanë shpenguar "ndjen e qesharakeitetit të tyre" ku Scorsese do të thotë që ne të marrim seriozisht Hugo, dhe unë nuk mendoj se ky është rasti, të paktën në pikën e mëvonshme. Kjo është një pasion i dukshëm për filmat, unë mendoj, pse ju do ta interpretoni Hugo si vetë-serioz, por për mua ato ndjenja që i japin filmit një çakëll emocional që nuk e kanë filmat Luhrmann dhe Jeunet. Të tre filmat përdorin në mënyrë agresive mrekullitë e CGI – dhe Scorsese shton 3D në përzierje, në efekt të mrekullueshëm – por ku ju dhe unë dallojmë është për çështjen e mungesës së peshës. Jam dakord që CGI ka një efekt distancues; botët e përbëra tërësisht nga plastike dixhitale janë fleksibël deri në atë pikë ku ndonjëherë nuk kanë prani. Ju i referoheni Hugo-t në hyrjen tuaj "të Mbivlerësuar" për pjesën tonë më të mirë të filmit si "një CGI gimcrack" - një disk i përsosur... për një film tjetër.<br/><br/>Reklama<br/><br/>Është e drejtë të thuhet se Scorsese ka ndërtuar Hugo rreth një çështje standarde, "mirësjellësin" librin e fëmijëve/film komplot: Orfan misses babai i tij, krijon botën e tij të vogël fantazi, shkëlqen mbi një mik të ri, bind një të guximshëm të vjetër mik për ta zbutur dhe ndoshta ta adoptojë atë. Por kjo është vetëm skelet narrativ, dhe Scorsese ofron shumë mish dhe gjak. Për një, ju nuk mund të shikojnë Hugo, djali i vetmuar, duke dalë nga kullat e orës në ngutje dhe nxitimin e një stacioni treni në Paris pa menduar për Scorsese, një tjetër djalë i vetmuar, duke parë nga dritarja e tij e gjumit në Elizabeth Street. Dhe edhe nëse nuk jeni një budalla aq i madh për ta bërë këtë lidhje, me të vërtetë më duket sikur udhëtimi i Hugo nuk është në gjetjen e një figure të re baba, por në këmbënguljen e magjisë mekanike që qëndron si trashëgimia e babait të tij. Ky film është: Këmbëngulja e vizionit që na lejon të pranojmë një version iluziv të botës në 24 kuadro në sekondë është shkenca dhe magjia në të njëjtën kohë. Marrëdhëniet e Hugos me Méliès nuk kanë të bëjnë me atë që rehatohet deri në një baba të ri, por ndarja e një entuziazmi të përbashkët që burri i moshuar ka vuajtur në hidhërim. Për mua, kjo është një kënd shumë më unik në një premisë potencialisht të mbajtur në dyqan.<br/><br/>Edhe ata pak detraktorë të filmit duken të gatshëm të pranojnë se sekuencat e evokojnë historinë e kinemasë dhe studion e Méliès – me Michael Stuhlbarg-in si dijetar heroik i filmit!—ishin të frikshëm. Ndjehej, në mënyrën më të mirë të mundshme, si një kompresim me kokë i klasës sime historike të filmit 101 në kolegj, duke kondensuar vlerën e klipeve dhe kontekstit në diçka mes një montazhi dhe një libri të animuar pop-up. Dhe flet për dizajnin gjenial të filmit, i cili shtreson faktin dhe fantazinë aq bukur sa që është një histori e Méliès dhe lindjes së kinemasë, dhe vetëm lloj mrekullie e thjeshtë, e prodhuar në mënyrë të kushtueshme se Scorsese vetë do të kishte dashur si fëmijë. Falënderimi që Hugo nuk e ndjek modelin e Jeunet/Luhrmann dhe ka "një ndjenjë talljeje të vet". Si një njohës fantazi veten, nuk do të thoni se ka vlerë në të luajtur atë të drejtë dhe të sinqertë dhe të pabazuar në vend që të shkelësh audiencën?, Ju mund të gjeni Hugo sëmurë ëmbël, por unë nuk mendoj se vërtetësia e ndjenjës së saj është për t'u mohuar.<br/><br/>Reklama<br/><br/>Tasha: Po, në fakt gjeta pjesë të magjepsjes së Hugo. (Vendojeni se si t'i përgjigjem pyetjes tuaj përpara, ndërsa ju jeni shumë të zënë nga ardhja me apopleksinë për të adresuar timin, megjithëse supozoj se kjo është një përgjigje në të djathtë të saj. Mirë, "influenca" mund të jetë mbivendosje e rastit - thjesht e kisha shumë të njohur stilin vizual. Megjithëse si Keith vuri në dukje kur e ngrite këtë personalisht, Scorsese nuk është në kundërshtim me vizatimin e frymëzimit nga vizualët e njerëzve të tjerë, as imun ndaj tij.) Në radhë të parë, më magjepsën pjesët që merreshin me historinë e Xhorxh Méliès, me dashurinë e tij për kinemanë, me veprën që ai e futi në artin e tij dhe gëzimin që nxori nga ajo. Ka shumë bukuri dhe argëtim në skenën e oborrit nënujore nga Méliès "Fairland", dhe në sekuencën në fund, duke u përqëndruar në pamjet e Méliès. Do t'ju jap se lidhja e Hugo me Méliès mbi një dashuri të përbashkët të filmit është një prekje e këndshme.<br/><br/>Por Hugo nuk ka të bëjë kryesisht me filmin, pavarësisht nga lidhjet e Méliès., Përveç temave që përmendin, ka të bëjë edhe me gjetjen e qëllimit tuaj, siç i shpjegojnë në mënyrë të shprehur personazhet njëri-tjetrit dhe neve. Dhe ka të bëjë me spektaklin, dhe pjesët e mëdha të veprimit, dhe ndjekjet, dhe mbaresa të lumtura që kanë ndodhur ndonjëherë, ku edhe bullizmi i zemëruar dhe çifti i moshuar i turpshëm dhe hajduti, madje edhe dachsund i çmendur të gjitha bashkohen me interesat simpatike të dashurisë deri në fund. Ka të bëjë me super-precocious Hermione Granger-type duke qenë i pasur dhe i zgjuar dhe duke lavdëruar botët magjike të përfshira në libra.Dhe e gjithë kjo biznes është i njohur shumë dhe i fuqishëm artificial.<br/><br/>Reklama<br/><br/>Po, Scorsese është duke luajtur me archetypes. problem është, unë kurrë nuk mendonin se ai i ka mbushur ato me ndonjë gjë të re, të freskët, ose të besueshme, pavarësisht nga historinë e tij prapa. Unë do të kisha preferuar shumë një histori në lidhje me një Scorsese të ri duke u rritur me astmë - diçka në shkallë të vogël dhe të vërtetë, pa dhoma të mëdha plot me clockwork CGI dhe golden glowing pluhur-mota dhe ëndrra profetike dhe një rojë të rritur të tërbuar me një zemër prej ari - e gjithë kjo jashtëzakonisht e lartë. Ju vazhdoni të citoni historinë personale të Scorsese dhe dashurinë e filmit si dëshmi se ai është me të vërtetë duke ndjerë atë që ai është vënë në ekran, por unë nuk e ndiej prekjen e tij personale në asnjë nga këto, përveç çasteve që janë shprehimisht për filmin. Emocionet thelbësore mund të jenë reale, por kjo nuk e bën ekzekutimin më pak të rremë.<br/><br/>Ju thoni se vërtetësia e emocioneve nuk është për t’u mohuar. Unë nuk vë në pikëpyetje nëse Scorsese personalisht ndjehet i vetmuar dhe i izoluar si fëmijë, por unë nuk ndjehem vetmia dhe izolimi në ekran— Shoh një grup të tillë shenjash të ekzagjeruara (Hugo është i ndyrë dhe rrobat e tij janë veshur dhe të gjithë të rriturit qe ndjejnë tek ai dhe ai rregullisht bëhet i ndjekur nga një qen i frikshëm!) dhe rrahje të mëdha, me të bërtitur dhe të qarë dhe Spielbergian mrekulli-emoting. Për mua, sinqeriteti është më bindës dhe më personal kur është i qetë dhe i drejtpërdrejtë; kur dikush thërret opinionet e tij në mua, supozoj se ai është me të vërtetë i zemëruar, ose thjesht duke u përpjekur të mposht shqisat e mia për të më mbajtur nga shprehja mendimin tim. Hugo ishte një ulërimë e gjatë, për sa më shqetësonte.<br/><br/>Reklama<br/><br/>Pse nuk e mora atë ndjenjën e falsifikimit nga Amélie, e pyet? Në fakt, e bëra. Unë do të pranojnë plotësisht se Amélie dhe Moulin Rouge janë të dyja të mëdha, manipuluese, ndërtime artificiale në të njëjtën venë, duke kërkuar emocione specifike në intervale të caktuara, dhe duke u përpjekur për të shitur ato emocione me emocione të rënda dhe largpamëse prodhojnë zëri. Asnjëri prej tyre nuk më shiti vërtet për emocionet e tyre si ndjenja e vërtetë njerëzore. Ajo që më pëlqente në ato dy filma ishte ndërtimi - veçanërisht listat e rënda të Amélie-s, të qeshura të tipareve dhe përvojave të rastësishme karakteristike për derdhjen e saj, dhe maskupet muzikore dhe rekontekstualizimet e Moulin Rouge. Shpesh jam shitur në tregime që bëjnë gjëra krijuese ose ambicioze me strukturë dhe të dyja ato filma të kualifikohen, ku Hugo është një kërkim shumë më linear, standard për fëmijë.<br/><br/>Por në fund të fundit, për mua, me të vërtetë ka ardhur poshtë në një ndjenjë se ato filma janë çati, ndërsa Hugo është menduar të merret seriozisht në çdo moment të vërtetë. Ju nuk mendoni se kjo është e vërtetë, por njëkohësisht jeni duke mbrojtur integritetin e saj në aspektin e emocioneve të tij absolutisht autentike në historinë e Scorsese, dhe duke më thënë se jam e gabuar, dhe ai nuk do të thotë se ajo duhet të merret seriozisht. Si i pranoni këto dy deklarata? Po në lidhje me filmin ju sugjeron se nuk është menduar të merret në vlerën e fytyrës? Dhe a është e mundur që kjo është vetëm një tjetër rast Kurioz i situatave të Butonit të Benjaminit, ku unë gjej përdorimin e fëmijëve në filma me buxhet të madh të jenë kryesisht të pakënaqur dhe melodramatikë, ndërsa ju si një baba e gjeni atë anashkalon cinizmin tuaj dhe shkon drejt në ndjenjën tuaj familjare?<br/><br/>Reklama<br/><br/>Scott: Nuk jam i sigurt që do të thotë Scorsese nuk do të thotë të merret seriozisht; është vetëm se ai është zgjedhur një automjet çuditshëm përmes të cilit për të shprehur një dashuri serioze të filmave. Kur ju thoni, "Por Hugo nuk ka të bëjë kryesisht me filmin, pavarësisht nga lidhjet e Méliès", unë kam gabuar. Unë ju jap që ju të gjeni shumë elemente të Hugo tepër të njohur dhe të zellshëm dhe të plotë të Spielbergian mrekulli-emoting - nuk ka asgjë që unë mund të bëj për të argumentuar rreth asaj perceptimi, të cilën dyshimi tjetër Hugo ndajnë. Ndonjëherë një film do të thotë të magjepsë, dhe kjo nuk është për disa; ju keni Hugo dhe unë kam Amélie, edhe pse unë mendoj se ky i fundit, qëllimisht artificiale siç është, do të thotë për ne për ta gjetur atë romantike. (Në vend që të themi, disa tkurrje mekanike të tmerrshme përshtaten për një vazhdim të sharrës.)<br/><br/>Nëse nuk bëhet fjalë për film, atëherë është tregimi më diskuriv për [gjithçka që mendoni se është] E kam parë ndonjëherë. Marrëdhënia midis Hugo and Méliès është zemra e filmit dhe në zemër të kësaj nuk është vetëm një lidhje stoku midis komunitetit të qejfit dhe "Crusty Old Guy" me një zemër ari, por një prirje e përbashkët për magjinë e inxhinierisë - sidomos për magjinë e filmave. Mendoj se Scorsese dhe bashkëpunëtorët e tij kanë gjetur një mënyrë për të shprehur entuziazmin e tyre gjatë ditëve të para të kinemasë përmes një fantazie që është e aksesueshme për të gjitha moshat.Tregimi i fëmijëve të mbushur me arketip është thjesht kripa këtu; kinemaja është byrek. (Mmmmm... byrek.)<br/><br/>Reklama<br/><br/>Për sa i përket Rastit Kurioz të Buttonit Benjamin, unë nuk shoh shumë të një lidhje, përveç përpjekjeve për të më ekspozuar si një mbrojtës i Benjamin Button si një mënyrë e dëmtimit të besueshmërisë time. (Ically, si janë ekstra në atë G.I. Joe: Ngritja e Cobra Blu-ray?) Unë ju kam thënë se baba i ri i privuar nga gjumi në mua ishte ndoshta i prekshëm nga Benjamin Button, por unë nuk mund të imagjinohet një kohë kur premisa e plakjes në të kundërt nuk do të lëvizë mua. (Mbyllni dashurinë e jetës tuaj në krahët tuaj si një foshnjë? Si nuk mund të ndikohet nga kjo?) Dhe përveç kësaj, unë nuk shoh se si Benjamin Button lidhet shumë me Hugo si një film në lidhje me fëmijët, pasi kjo është vetëm një segment i vogël i një histori që përfshin një trajektore shumë më të madhe.<br/><br/>Por jam i lumtur të mësoj se Hugo nuk ishte plotësisht i lirë nga magjepsjet për ju. Sekuencat në Méliès filmbërësi janë ato që e vënë Hugo fort për mua – dhe në këtë, të paktën mund të ndajmë disa dashuri nga filmat.<br/><br/>Reklama<br/><br/>Tasha: Shpikë, nuk mund të them se më ke bindur, më shumë se unë të kam bindur., Është e pamundur të argumentosh askënd në një dashuri të thellë për asgjë, dhe me të vërtetë duhet të jetë e pamundur të flasësh në mënyrë të barabartë me dikë poshtë nga dashuria e brendshme. Kryesisht, më lejoni të shoh Hugo in Scott-O-Vision, e cila është një përvojë interesante; të paktën tani unë jam i bindur se nuk kemi arritur disi të shohim filma krejtësisht të ndryshëm të cilët të dy disi kishin të njëjtin emër dhe drejtor.<br/><br/>Ne sigurisht që kemi pasur përvoja të ndryshme, dhe për mendjen time, të përqendruar në aspekte të ndryshme të prodhimit: Unë ende nuk e shoh "filmin" temë si trungu i vetëm i filmit, aq shumë sa një në mesin e shumë. "Pikërisht diskutuese" pothuajse e mbulon atë, edhe pse unë do të hedh në "shpesh e bukur dhe e çmuar" mbi të. Ndërsa jeni të fokusuar në mbushjen e shijshme të byrekut të filmit, më duket se byreku ishte i mbuluar me një kile sheqer të kristalizuar, dhe mendoj se kjo bën një ndryshim, pavarësisht nga mesazhi kryesor i filmit ose grushti i skenave të frikshëm. Shih gjithashtu Benjamin Button, të cilën unë nuk e kam sjellë vetëm për të thyej ju - unë me të vërtetë mendoj se ju keni më shumë një rrjedhë sentimentale se unë bëj në lidhje me fëmijët në kinema, sidomos kur ata janë përdorur më shumë si simbole të cenueshmërisë dhe pafajësisë se sa si karaktere njerëzore. Hej, ju e dini se çfarë filmi plotësisht nuk ka oxhaqet e bukur me sy të gjerë duke sjellë shpresë për një botë cinike?G.I. Joe: Ngritja e Cobra. Ndoshta do të shkoj të shikoj ato shtesa me rreze Blu.Unë mund të përdor disa shpërthim-insulin për të kompensuar ëmbëlsinë e Hugo-s. |
| "I hoped my daughter would be free from difficult and troubling times": Mee Mee's story as a refugee Mom<br/><br/>Hope in Times of Crisis: A Mother's Day Story<br/><br/>By Judith Santiago*<br/><br/>Mee Mee heard that the soldiers were coming. She took hold of her son and frantically joined the rest of the villagers who were running toward the Thai-Burmese border, where the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) was located. Her husband was in another village running in the opposite direction, Mee later learned. After the soldiers' pursuit ended, Mee returned home to her small village in Koechi, Burma.<br/><br/>During 1997-2000, Mee and thousands like her lived under the constant threat of violence from Burmese soldiers. Many people would take temporary refuge in the jungle, and return home to their village after soldiers left the area, just to do it all over again days later. About once a week, Mee and others would be on the move to avoid capture, rape, or death by soldiers.<br/><br/>During one incident, Mee's husband ran ahead of his wife to secure food for his family. Her husband was spotted by soldiers and shot. The bullet shattered a portion of his ribcage, leaving him severely wounded and in distress as he journeyed toward the jungle with his family for safety.<br/><br/>For three months, Mee's husband hid and moved the family with an exasperating wound at his side. He received no medical care, except for Mee's tending.<br/><br/>"I was afraid to return to Burma," Mee said through an interpreter. "I feared dying. I cried and cried every day," she continued.<br/><br/>Mee's husband eventually drew enough strength to walk five days toward a small village in Thailand where they learned the location of a hospital and a refugee camp. When Mee and her husband finally arrived at the hospital, he underwent immediate surgery and later recovered.<br/><br/>Symbol of Hope<br/><br/>Life in the jungle for those fleeing Burmese soldiers was indeed terrifying and difficult. Makeshift bamboo tents with only roof and floor coverings became suitable temporary dwellings. Many women including Mee gave birth to children in the jungle. Mee's then six-year-old son assisted in the delivery of his sister named Eh Ku Hser. Her name means love – cold – sweet. "Cold" in Burmese culture means so as to not pass through the fire of life, as heat represents troubled times.<br/><br/>"I hoped my daughter would be free from difficult and troubling times," said Mee. "I did not want her to go through what I had experienced," she continued.<br/><br/>For Mee, the birth of her daughter in the midst of darkness, torment and fear, was a symbol of hope for a new life to come. Hope in times of crisis, the very premise of the United Methodist Committee on Relief's (UMCOR) newly co-branded UMCOR-Prosperity Candle, is also the essence of that which candles shed light upon.<br/><br/>A New Beginning<br/><br/>With the help of UNHCR, hope for a new life did indeed materialize for Mee and her family when they resettled in West Springfield, Massachusetts. There, Mee met Moo Kho Paw, another woman who emigrated from Burma, and who was working at Prosperity Candle in Florence. The organization helps refugee women who have escaped areas of conflict rebuild their lives through the art of candle making. Moo Kho recommended that Mee join the organization, and Mee gladly accepted.<br/><br/>"I was excited to be out of the house," said Mee, "I was raised to believe that because I was a woman, my role was to remain at home and raise my family," she continued. "While many Burmese women want to do more for themselves, they are often encouraged to remain homemakers."<br/><br/>Today, Mee has plans to go into the candle-making business for herself and support her five children, but she expressed the need to learn English first.<br/><br/>"In the Thai refugee camp, we had education, but it was not so good," said Mee. "When I was a child, I wanted to go to school, but I was told to stay home because I was a woman. Now, I have hopes for my daughters to go to college and become doctors or policewomen," continued Mee.<br/><br/>Mee has struck an even balance in her life that she wishes others would have found—a simple, happy life where work, caring for family members and freedom of choice all have their place.<br/><br/>Support Refugee Women in the US<br/><br/>Share this Mother's Day story with your loved ones. And, when you purchase handmade candles by Mee, Moo Kho, and Naw, another Burmese refugee woman working at Prosperity Candle , know you are helping to support their livelihood as they rebuild their lives and those of their family members in the US. | "Unë shpresoj se vajza ime do të ishte e lirë nga kohë të vështira dhe shqetësuese": Historia e Mee si refugjate<br/><br/>Shpresë në kohë krize: Dita e Nënës Histori<br/><br/>Nga Judith Santiago*<br/><br/>Mua më dëgjuan se ushtarët po vinin. Ajo mori djalin e saj dhe sinqerisht iu bashkua pjesës tjetër të fshatarëve që po iknin drejt kufirit tajlandez-burmez, ku ishte Zyra e Komisionerit të Lartë të Kombeve të Bashkuara për Refugjatë (UNHCR). Burri i saj ishte në një fshat tjetër që vraponte në drejtim të kundërt, Mee më vonë mësoi.Pas përfundimit të ndjekjes së ushtarëve, Meja u kthye në shtëpi në fshatin e saj të vogël në Koechi, Burma.<br/><br/>Gjatë viteve 1997-2000, Meja dhe mijëra si ajo jetuan nën kërcënimin e vazhdueshëm të dhunës nga ushtarët burmezë. Shumë njerëz merrnin strehim të përkohshëm në xhungël, dhe kthehen në shtëpi në fshatin e tyre pasi ushtarët u larguan nga zona, vetëm për ta bërë atë përsëri më vonë. Rreth një herë në javë, Mua dhe të tjerët do të ishin në lëvizje për të shmangur kapjen, përdhunimin ose vdekjen nga ushtarët.<br/><br/>Gjatë një incidenti, burri i Mee-s vrapoi përpara gruas së tij për të siguruar ushqim për familjen e tij.Burri i saj u pa nga ushtarët dhe u qëllua. Plumbi shkatërroi një pjesë të brinjëve të tij, duke e lënë atë të plagosur rëndë dhe në ankth ndërsa udhëtonte drejt xhunglës me familjen e tij për siguri.<br/><br/>Për tre muaj, burri i Mee-s u fsheh dhe e lëvizi familjen me një plagë të jashtëzakonshme në krah, pa marrë asnjë kujdes mjekësor, përveç prirjes së Mee-s.<br/><br/>Unë kisha frikë të kthehem në Burma," - tha Meu përmes një përkthyesi. "Kam frikë se vdes, dhe unë qava çdo ditë," vazhdoi ajo.<br/><br/>Burri i meje përfundimisht nxori forcë të mjaftueshme për të ecur pesë ditë drejt një fshati të vogël në Tajlandë ku mësoi vendndodhjen e një spitali dhe një kampi refugjatësh. Kur Mua dhe bashkëshorti i saj më në fund erdhën në spital, ai iu nënshtrua një operacioni të menjëhershëm dhe më vonë u shërua.<br/><br/>Simboli i shpresës<br/><br/>Jeta në xhungël për ata ushtarë të arratisur burmezë ishte me të vërtetë e tmerrshme dhe e vështirë.Madheni tenda bambu me vetëm çati dhe dysheme u bënë banesa të përshtatshme të përkohshme. Djali në atë kohë, gjashtë vjeçar, më ndihmoi në dorëzimin e motrës së tij me emrin Eh Ku Hser. Emri i saj do të thotë dashuri – i ftohtë – i ëmbël.

| The Precedency Essay<br/><br/>1562 words - 7 pages<br/><br/>Affirmative action is a government policy that gives opportunities to minorities, women, and any group who has been the victim of discrimination in the past. Affirmative action is the outcome of the 1960's Civil Rights movement, growing out of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 which outlawed discrimination based on race, ethnicity, or gender. It was the 1978 Supreme Court decision, The Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, which allowed for the use of race-based preferences as a means of fostering diversity, allowing affirmative action to be used in admissions policies. It was created with the intention to provide equal opportunities for members of minority groups in education and ...view middle of the document...<br/><br/>However, according to a 2007 report by the Pew Research Center, support for affirmative action among the American public has actually increased substantiallyin recent years, climbing from 58% in 1995 to 70% in 2007. Supporters of affirmative action make many arguments in support of affirmative action, in the hopes of getting others to see the genuine good that affirmative actin policies bring to our society. Supporters believe that affirmative action is more of a process rather than an admissions policy. Colleges and universities take the extra initiative to reach out to minority groups, encouraging them to apply. Colleges and universities offer additional financial aid and provide on-campus resources to help better the student's college education. Supporters also note the rising number of minority applications to colleges and universities due in part to affirmative action policies.<br/>Statistics have proven that when affirmative action is eliminated, such as when it was at Berkley College and UCLA in 1998, the minority student admissions fell 61 percent and 36 percent respectively, proving that affirmative action plays a major role in a minority students college admissions process. Affirmative action supporters also believe that diversity in higher education provides a better educational atmosphere for all students, personally and intellectually. If affirmative action were to be eliminated, there would be fewer minority students enrolled in colleges, causing diversity to be fairly slim. Affirmative action policies are also necessary in order to compensate for centuries of racial, economic, and social oppression. Individuals with a higher socioeconomic status have more opportunities than those of lower socioeconomic backgrounds. Supporters believe that certain racial or ethnic groups are disadvantaged because they are frequently in lower income households and consequently are not exposed to the same resources as students from higher socioeconomic classes. Advocates support the notion of competition between students based on merit, but argue that affirmative action compensates for economic differences. College graduates, who have benefitted from affirmative action, have also said that they received better jobs, earned more money, and overall live better lives because of the fortunate opportunities they received through affirmative action.<br/>Supporters of affirmative action continuously stress the severe importance of affirmative action, considering its contributions to enhancing both the college experience and society in general. However, opponents of affirmative action believe that the time has come to end affirmative action. Opponents believe affirmative action was created to ensure fair admission practices to bring change to a long period of racial discrimination. They believe the policy is outdated."It's time to pull the plug on race-based decision making," says Ward Connerly, a Sacramento, California businessman and lead organizer of...<br/><br/>Find Another Essay On The Precedency<br/><br/>754 words - 4 pages<br/>of the burden to continue prospering.

Veprimi afirmativ është rezultati i lëvizjes për të drejtat civile të vitit 1960, duke u rritur nga Ligji për të Drejtat Civile i vitit 1964, i cili shpërfilli diskriminimet bazuar në racë, etni ose gjini. Ishte vendimi i vitit 1978 i Gjykatës Supreme, Regjentët e Universitetit të Kalifornisë v.

Mbështetësit e veprimit afirmativ bëjnë shumë argumente në mbështetje të veprimit afirmativ, me shpresën për t’u bërë të tjerëve për të parë të mirën e vërtetë që politikat afirmative sjellin në shoqërinë tonë. Mbështetësit besojnë se veprimi afirmativ është më shumë se një proces pranimi sesa një politikë pranimesh. Kolegjet dhe universitetet marrin iniciativën shtesë për të arritur tek grupet e pakicave, duke i inkurajuar ata që të aplikojnë. Kolegjet dhe universitetet ofrojnë ndihmë shtesë financiare dhe ofrojnë resurse në kampus për të ndihmuar më mirë edukimin e kolegjit të studentit. Mbështetësit gjithashtu vënë në dukje numrin në rritje të aplikimeve të pakicave në kolegje dhe universitete për shkak të politikave të veprimeve afirmative.<br/>Statistikat kanë vërtetuar se kur arrihet një veprim afirmativ, siç ishte rasti në Kolegjin Berkley dhe në atë UCLA në vitin 1998, pranimet e studentëve të pakicës ranë respektivisht 61 përqind dhe 36 përqind e tyre, duke provuar se veprimi afirmativ luan një rol të madh në një proces pranimesh në kolegjin e studentëve të pakicave. Mbështetësit e veprimit afirmativ besojnë gjithashtu se diversiteti në arsimin e lartë siguron një atmosferë më të mirë edukative për të gjithë studentët, personalisht dhe intelektualisht. Nëse do të eliminohej veprimi afirmativ, do të kishte më pak studentë të pakicës të regjistruar në kolegje, duke bërë që diversiteti të ishte mjaft i vogël. Politikat afirmative të veprimit janë gjithashtu të nevojshme për të kompensuar për shekuj me radhë shtypjen racore, ekonomike dhe sociale.Individët me status më të lartë socio-ekonomik kanë më shumë mundësi sesa ato të prejardhjeve më të ulëta socio-ekonomike. Mbështetësit besojnë se disa grupe të caktuara racore ose etnike janë të pafavorizuara, sepse shpesh janë në familje me të ardhura më të ulëta dhe për pasojë nuk ekspozohen ndaj të njëjtave burime si studentë nga klasa më e lartë socio-ekonomike. Avokatët mbështesin nocionin e konkurrencës në mes të studentëve bazuar në meritë, por argumentojnë se masat afirmative kompensojnë ndryshime ekonomike. Të diplomuarit e kolegjit, të cilët kanë përfituar nga afirmative, gjithashtu kanë thënë se kanë marrë punë më të mira, kanë fituar më shumë para dhe jetojnë më mirë për shkak të mundësive fatlume që kanë marrë përmes veprimit afirmativ.<br/>Mbështetësit e veprimit afirmativ vazhdimisht theksojnë rëndësinë e rëndë të veprimit afirmativ, duke marrë parasysh kontributin e tij në rritjen e përvojës së kolegjit dhe shoqërisë në përgjithësi. Megjithatë, kundërshtarët e veprimit afirmativ besojnë se ka ardhur koha për t’i dhënë fund aksionit afirmativ.Oponentët besojnë se veprimi afirmativ është krijuar për të siguruar praktika të drejta pranimi për të sjellë ndryshim në një periudhë të gjatë diskriminimi racor.

The University of South Carolina Columbia<br/>Campus hosted a number of free, public programs beginning on Aug. 17.<br/><br/>On Fri., Aug. 18, solar physicist Dr. Sarbani Basu, Department of Astronomy Chair at Yale University, discussed the history of solar<br/>eclipses and what humankind has learned from them in a public lecture.<br/><br/>On Sun., Aug. 20, visitors to campus took part in a series of free, 30-minute talks<br/>by USC faculty and visiting scholars Ramesh Kapoor, Gerardo Vazquez, James Overduin and Kristin Simunac.<br/><br/>Held at Swearingen Engineering Center, the series hosted experts who discussed the role of eclipses in science and society, and how eclipses have factored in myths<br/>and legends throughout history.<br/><br/>Visitors to Spirit Communications Park on eclipse day were invited to explore the Degrees of Health with UofSC at the iMAGINE STEM Festival. This full day of fun included interactive STEM exhibits (science, technology, engineering<br/>and math) from UofSC and other organizations. Tickets also included the 1:05 p.m.<br/>Columbia Fireflies vs. Rome Braves game and Total Eclipse of the Park.<br/><br/>For those who preferred to beat the heat and watch the eclipse inside, we offered<br/>live stream viewing of NASA TV's Eclipse Megacast in several areas across the Columbia Campus.<br/><br/>A variety of experts visited locations across campus to share how eclipses are woven<br/>into our science, culture, history and art. Allison Marsh, Steven Rodney, Michael Weisenburg, Scott White, Varsha Kulkarni, Nate Carnes and Zhenlong Li each hosted 20-minute public discussions leading up to the eclipse.<br/><br/>The Department of Physics and Astronomy operated 10 outdoor and 5 indoor viewing stations across campus with telescopes, activities and/or NASA live video streams. Viewers<br/>could choose their eclipse experience with access to expert discussions and telescopic technology<br/>or fun activities such as disc golf and family-friendly crafts.<br/><br/>USC's Naturalist-in-Residence Rudy Mancke visited viewers on the historic Horseshoe to share the nature of the solar eclipse,<br/>leading up to the 2.5 minutes of totality beginning at 2:41 pm.<br/><br/>After the sun fully re-emerged, the university hosted an Eclipse Reception for rising high school seniors and upcoming graduate students.<br/><br/>In the late afternoon, the Darla Moore School of Business hosted a free, public talk<br/>by Dr. Craig Roberts, a distinguished professor and senior physicist at Argonne National Laboratory, one<br/>of the U.S. Department of Energy's national laboratories for science and engineering<br/>research. In his "Laying the God Particle to Rest" discussion, Dr. Roberts discussed Higgs Boson and why it cannot be used to identify<br/>the source of more than 98 percent of the universe's visible mass.<br/><br/>The big day finally came to a close at Williams Brice Stadium where visitors could<br/>enjoy the university's gridiron stars. An open practice of the 2017 Gamecock football team was the perfect ending to a phenomenal day.<br/><br/>Highlighting History<br/><br/>Campus visitors could mingle alongside eclipse experts and everyone near and far was invited to share in this once-in-a-lifetime experience.

Në Karolinën, ne festuam selinë e komunitetit me një seri të gjerë ekspozitash qiellore, diskutime ekspertësh dhe kërkime shkencore.<br/><br/>Në orën 2:41 në orën 21 gusht, në zonën e Kolumbisë, SC shijoi një ndenjëse në rreshtin e parë në histori me një lartësi totale prej 100 për qind të periudhës së shikimit të eklipsit të dy minutave dhe 36 sekondave. Ndërkohë që eklipset e pjesshme janë më të zakonshme, eklipsi total i diellit i gushtit ishte një ngjarje e jashtëzakonshme dhe e rrallë.Në ditët që çuan në ngjarjen e madhe dhe në ditën e eklipsit, kampusi ynë u mbush me studentë, vizitorë dhe vizitorë. Jo vetëm që vizitorët tanë shijuan një pamje në rrugën e plotë, ata gjithashtu fituan perspektivë thelbësore nga ekspertët tanë universitarë, përfshirë astrofizikën, studiuesit, natyralistët dhe artistët.<br/><br/>Luani video<br/><br/>Eklipsi total 2017: 6:01<br/><br/>Një përvojë e mrekullueshme mësimi<br/><br/>Eklipsi i përgjithshëm diellor më 21 gusht ishte një moment ujërash për Karolinën, Kolumbinë dhe Shtetet e Bashkuara.I pari eklips total diellor në SHBA kontinentale që nga viti<br/>1979, dhe eklipsi i parë i plotë diellor transkontinental, në të cilin rruga e eklipsit shkon në bregdet, në 99 vjet.<br/><br/>Për Prillin Hiscox, profesor i asociuar në Departamentin e Gjeografisë, eklipsi rriti hulumtimin e saj të atmosferës së afërt të Tokës, shtresa që shtrihet nga sipërfaqja e tokës në rreth një gjysmë milje të larta. Për fizikën dhe profesorin e astronomisë Timir Data, ishte një moment për të rikrijuar një eksperiment të famshëm në 1919 që ndihmoi në konfirmimin e teorisë së relativitetit të përgjithshëm të Albert Ajnshtajnit.<br/>Hartstone- Rose, profesor i asociuar në Shkollën e Mjekësisë dhe ndihmës shkencëtar në Riverbanks Zoo, ishte një mundësi për të studiuar sjellje të çuditshme të kafshëve.<br/><br/>Profesori i artit në Studio dhe studiuesi Chris Robinson lidhën artin dhe shkencën përmes instalimit të tij unik me laser të Dritave Jugore, i cili debutoi në Sat., 19 gusht. Instalimi në shkallë të gjerë, i cili do të kalojë lumin Congaree pranë urës Rruga Blooms, është planifikuar për ekran afatgjatë në mënyrë që vizitorët të shijojnë përvojën unike me rreze lazer.<br/><br/>Një orar i ngjarjeve epike<br/><br/>Të jesh në shtëpi në periudhën më të gjatë të eklipsit të përgjithshëm në Bregun Lindor ishte i rëndësishëm.<br/>Kjo është arsyeja pse, në të gjithë qytetin, mund të shijoni një galaktikë të ngjarjeve të lidhura me eklipsin në ditët që çuan në ngjarjen kryesore.<br/>Kampusi priti një numër të programeve falas, publike duke filluar më 17 gusht.<br/><br/>Më 18 gusht, fizikani diellor Dr. Sarbani Basu, Departamenti i Astronomisë në Universitetin Yale, diskutoi për historinë e eklipseve diellore dhe atë që njerëzimi ka mësuar prej tyre në një leksion publik.<br/><br/>Në diell, 20 gusht, vizitorët në kampus morën pjesë në një seri bisedimesh falas 30-minutëshe nga fakulteti i USC dhe studiuesi i ftuar Ramesh Kapoor, Gerardo Vazquez, James Overduin dhe Kristin Simunac.<br/><br/>E mbajtur në Qendrën Inxhinjerike Sweringen, seria pret ekspertë të cilët diskutuan mbi rolin e eklipsit në shkencë dhe shoqëri, dhe se si eklipset kanë faktorizuar në mitet dhe legjendat gjatë gjithë historisë.<br/><br/>Vizitorët në Parkun e Komunikimit të Shpirtit në ditën e eklipsit janë ftuar të eksplorojnë Shkallët e Shëndetit me UofSC në festivalin e iMAGINE STEM.

| Combinations<br/><br/>Combinations Are defenses against a punch, choreographed responses to different types of attacks. They have many names across the martial arts but (in my experience) every art has a version of them. This makes them different than forms because there are plenty of martial arts that have no forms. What makes there partner exercises so universal? Why practice a specific response when (in reality) timing, type of attack, size of the attacker, and a hundred other factors will make it so you never use that entire choreographed response? And finally, how can we practice for a real defense situation and avoid injury at the same time?<br/><br/>The universality of combinations is impressive, to say the least. Our style of Kenpo karate has a list of 108 combos that can be learned. (Most students only learn 20-30 though) In Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu you spend whole classes practicing arm bars and chokes, learning every subtlety to the move while your partner offers little to no resistance. Every boxer has spent hours in front of the bag and/or mirror throwing the same combination of punches until their body moves by reflex alone. Combinations are universal because we have no better way to introduce movement and then practice the subtle positions required to make them work. Hitting a small pressure point through clothing takes A LOT of practice, catching an arm bar with control requires a carefully placed hip and a sneaky setup, and a great combination is only useful if you can through it from a balanced and protected position. Can you think of a better way to gain these skills?<br/><br/>There is any number of factors that determine how you respond to an attack and whether in a sparring match or in a fight, I have NEVER used a full combination in my defense. Why, then, do we spend hours practicing them? We practice these choreographed responses because the objective is not to pull combination 8 out every time you see a hook punch but to show you one way of blocking it and then a possible way to follow it up. I have never chosen to use combination 3 in a reality situation but the block is one of my go-to moves. Combinations add tools to the toolbox they do not fix the car.<br/><br/>The last question is a question of safety. If we practice for the sake of reality we need to replicate reality. How do we prevent injury while doing so? When it comes down to it, it's about building trust. We start slow and learn to trust that we have control over ourselves. We learn to trust our partners have control as well. In more time we learn to trust our control over our partner and (a little scarier) we learn to trust our partner's control over us. In the end (with a lot of practice) you can move are full speed, tossing your partner, and being thrown without fear of injury.<br/><br/>Combinations are universal for a reason; they are practiced so they can be dissected into their parts, and we stay safe by starting slow and building trust. As with everything else in the martial arts, combinations have many reasons behind their practice and execution. | Kombinime<br/><br/>Kombinimet janë mbrojtje ndaj një grushti, përgjigje të koreportuara ndaj llojeve të ndryshme të sulmeve.Ata kanë shumë emra në të gjithë artet marciale, por (në përvojën time) çdo art ka një version të tyre. Kjo i bën ato të ndryshme nga format, sepse ka shumë arte marciale që nuk kanë forma.Çfarë e bën atë që të ketë ushtrime partnere kaq universale? Pse të praktikoni një përgjigje specifike kur (në realitet) koha, lloji i sulmit, madhësia e sulmuesit dhe njëqind faktorë të tjerë do ta bëjnë atë në mënyrë që të mos e përdorni kurrë atë përgjigje të tërë të orkestruar? Dhe së fundi, si mund të praktikojmë ne për një situatë të vërtetë të mbrojtjes dhe për të shmangur lëndimet në të njëjtën kohë?<br/><br/>Universaliteti i kombinimeve është mbresëlënës, për të thënë më pak. Stili ynë i karates Kenpo ka një listë prej 108 combos që mund të mësohet. (Shumica e nxënësve mësojnë vetëm 20-30) Në Jiu-Jitsu braziliane ju kaloni orë të tëra duke praktikuar bare krahu dhe chokes, duke mësuar çdo delikate në lëvizje ndërsa partneri juaj ofron pak rezistencë. Çdo boksier ka kaluar orë para çantës dhe/ose pasqyrës duke hedhur të njëjtën kombinim grushtash derisa trupi i tyre të lëvizë vetëm me refleks. Kombinimet janë universale sepse nuk kemi mënyrë më të mirë për të prezantuar lëvizjet dhe pastaj për të praktikuar pozicionet delikate të kërkuara për t'i bërë ato punë. Goditur një pikë të vogël presioni përmes veshjeve merr një SHUMË të praktikës, kapur një bar krah me kontrollin kërkon një hip vendosur me kujdes dhe një konfigurim të poshtër, dhe një kombinim i madh është i dobishëm vetëm nëse mund ta kaloni nga një pozicion i balancuar dhe i mbrojtur. A mund të mendoni për një mënyrë më të mirë për të fituar këto aftësi?<br/><br/>Ka ndonjë numër faktorësh që përcaktojnë se si i përgjigjeni një sulmi dhe nëse në një ndeshje të zgjuar ose në një luftë, unë kurrë nuk kam përdorur një kombinim të plotë në mbrojtjen time.Pse, pra, kaloni orë të tëra duke i praktikuar ato? Ne i praktikojmë këto përgjigje koreografike sepse objektivi nuk është që të tërheqë kombinacionin 8 sa herë që shihni një goditje, por t'ju tregojë një mënyrë për ta bllokuar atë dhe pastaj një mënyrë të mundshme për ta ndjekur atë. Unë kurrë nuk kam zgjedhur të përdorin kombinim 3 në një situatë reale, por blloku është një nga lëvizjet e mia të shkojnë. Kombinime shtoni mjete në kutinë e veglave që ata nuk e rregullojnë makinën.<br/><br/>Pyetja e fundit është një çështje sigurie.Nëse praktikojmë për hir të realitetit që na nevojitet për të përsëritur realitetin.Si e parandalojmë dëmtimet gjatë kësaj?Kur bëhet fjalë, ka të bëjë me ndërtimin e besimit. Ne fillojmë me ngadalë dhe mësojmë të besojmë se kemi kontroll mbi veten tonë.Ne mësojmë të besojmë gjithashtu se partnerët tanë kanë kontroll.Në më shumë kohë mësojmë të besojmë kontrollin tonë mbi partnerin tonë dhe (pak më e frikshme) ne mësojmë të besojmë kontrollin e partnerit tonë mbi ne. Në fund (me shumë praktikë) ju mund të lëvizin janë me shpejtësi të plotë, duke hedhur partnerin tuaj, dhe duke u hedhur pa frikë e lëndimit.<br/><br/>Kombinimet janë universale për një arsye; ato praktikohen në mënyrë që të mund të ndahen në pjesët e tyre dhe ne qëndrojmë të sigurt duke filluar nga qëndrueshmëria dhe ndërtimi. Ashtu si me çdo gjë tjetër në artet marciale, kombinimet kanë shumë arsye prapa praktikës së tyre dhe ekzekutimit. |
