| Forty-nine years ago today, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act of 1965.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Nearly a century ago, the 15th Amendment to the Constitution stated, "The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of race, color or previous condition of servitude." And nearly a century before that, our nation's founding fathers set in motion the great experiment of American democracy by declaring that "all men are created equal."<br/><br/>The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was a belated acknowledgment that even in America, our foundational ideals carry little weight if not protected by the rule of law. That's why Section 2 of the 15th Amendment granted Congress the "power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation."<br/><br/>And indeed, the codified language of the Voting Rights Act was able to achieve what the Reconstruction-era Congress and Thomas Jefferson could not. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act—and the civil rights movement from which they emerged—served as the catalyst for a dramatic increase in the opportunity for black Americans to participate in the democratic process.<br/><br/>For example, only 6.7 percent of eligible black Mississippians were registered to vote as of 1962; by 1969 that figure had reached 66.5 percent. Today, Mississippi has more black elected officials than any other state.<br/><br/>The protections put in place by the Voting Rights Act were long overdue when they were passed, representative of the arduous struggle with which they were achieved. But unthinkably, these protections are now under assault, jeopardizing the progress our nation worked so hard to achieve.<br/><br/>Last year, in the case of Shelby County v. Holder, the U.S. Supreme Court gutted a key component of the Voting Rights Act that enabled prior federal review to ensure nondiscrimination before any new voting law went into effect.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Sadly, the response of Republican leaders has been to do nothing. Sen. Ted Cruz and Gov. Rick Perry went out of their way to praise the Supreme Court's decision. Sen. Rand Paul dismissed the continued necessity of the Voting Rights Act by noting, "We have an African-American president."<br/><br/>While the election of President Barack Obama was indeed a historic milestone, it is dangerous to think that it absolves us from remaining vigilant against the lingering consequences of our nation's past. The haste with which states have moved to enact voting restrictions is confirmation that the protections put in place by Section 4 are still necessary.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Republican governors have signed strict photo-identification restrictions into law as the solution to a virtually nonexistent problem of voter impersonation, disproportionately hurting women, young people, working families and the African-American community. It's disingenuous for Republicans like Paul to seek the votes of these communities when they believe "there's nothing wrong with" putting restrictions in place that make it harder for these constituencies to vote.<br/><br/>Republicans have also sought to restrict early-voting periods, including the Sunday before Election Day, when African-American churches have had great success with Souls to the Polls programs.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>These restrictions represent a callous effort by Republicans to make voting harder, based on narrow, short-term political calculations that Republicans can win elections by shrinking the size of the electorate.<br/><br/>Democrats have a very different mission when it comes to voting: to ensure that every eligible voter can register, that every registered voter can vote and that every vote is accurately counted.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>The Democratic National Committee's Voter Expansion Project reflects our belief that greater voter participation strengthens our nation and our democracy. We'll continue to use our unmatched institutional knowledge to protect voting rights against legislation and tactics that would attempt to suppress the vote. And because the best defense is a good offense, we're also working to expand the vote by deploying our technology and data resources to register new voters.<br/><br/>On this anniversary, one of the best ways we can honor those who struggled—and in some cases gave their very lives—for the legislation's passage is for Republicans in Congress to join Democrats in passing the Voting Rights Amendment Act to restore the promise of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Democrat, represents Florida's 23rd Congressional District in the United States Congress.

Kjo është arsyeja pse Seksioni 2 i Amendamentit të 15-të i dha Kongresit "fuqinë për ta zbatuar këtë artikull me legjislacionin e duhur".<br/><br/>Dhe në të vërtetë, gjuha e kodifikuar e Aktit të të Drejtave të Votimit ishte në gjendje të arrinte atë që Kongresi i Epokës së Rindërtimit dhe Thomas Jefferson nuk mund të arrinte. Akti i të Drejtave Civile i vitit 1964 dhe Akti i të Drejtave të Votimit – dhe lëvizja e të drejtave civile nga e cila dolën – shërbyen si katalizator për një rritje dramatike të mundësisë për amerikanët e zinj për të marrë pjesë në procesin demokratik.<br/><br/>Për shembull, vetëm 6.7 për qind e Mizianëve të zinj të kualifikuar u regjistruan për të votuar që nga viti 1962; deri në vitin 1969 ajo shifër kishte arritur 66.5 për qind.Sot, Misisipi ka më shumë zyrtarë të zgjedhur të zi se çdo shtet tjetër.<br/><br/>Mbrojtja e vendosur në fuqi nga Akti i të Drejtave të Votimit ishte e vonuar kur ata u miratuan, përfaqësues i luftës së ashpër me të cilën ata u arritën.

| Q&A: Vatican safeguarding expert Fr Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>13 June 2021<br/><br/>Fr Hans Zollner SJ. Image: Australian Jesuits.<br/><br/>The President of the Centre for Child Protection at the Gregorian University in Rome, and a member of the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors, Fr Hans Zollner SJ, was in Australia in 2018 to speak to Catholic ministry leaders and survivors.<br/><br/>Michael McVeigh from Jesuit Communications sat down with him during the visit to explore how the Church is responding to the abuse crisis internationally, and what can be learned from our experiences in Australia.<br/><br/>MM: This is your third trip to Australia. You've visited quite a few other countries to see how the Church is responding to abuse around the world. Can you give us some idea of what the global picture looks like?<br/><br/>Fr Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>HZ: My understanding, after having visited about 50 countries on five or six continents, is that the Church is really starting to move over the last couple of years on the issue of doing justice to victims, of listening to them, and doing whatever can be done in terms of safeguarding.<br/><br/>I was with the Jesuit Provincials from all over Africa at the end of April, and the President of the Jesuit Assistancy of Africa and Madagascar is very much committed and dedicated to this. He has put up a thorough action plan for formation and for introducing guidelines all over the place. It's a very considerate and very deliberate effort to do whatever can be done to be proactively engaged as Jesuits in Africa — in a continent where until a few years ago all of this was a foreign language.<br/><br/>One of the challenges of trying to develop this global approach is that you're dealing with so many cultures, and so many different understandings. How do you bring this together and try to provide training and support religious communities tackling these issues?<br/><br/>This is one of the major questions we have. I think what I can do is stimulate discussion, stimulate reflection, and prepare people as much as possible so that they can do the groundwork.<br/><br/>The Centre for Child Protection at the Gregorian University does not pretend to have the response to every question. Not only because we don't know the specific contexts — we might know a few of them, but we're talking about thousands of cultures, we're talking about hundreds of languages, we're talking about very diverse legal backgrounds. It varies even sometimes within one country, such as Australia where you have states within the Commonwealth of Australia that have different laws than other states.<br/><br/>I am somebody who tries to elicit and stimulate discussion and reflection. I'm also very happy to listen to people.<br/><br/>You mentioned the need to listen and support victims in being heard. We've obviously had the Royal Commission here in Australia, but what are some of the other ways that you've seen that the voices of victims are being supported around the world?<br/><br/>In France there is one diocese that has established what they call 'The Listening Space'. There, victims can come forward and they can express themselves. The bishop is present. It's an open space in which people who have been hurt tremendously are free at least to express what they want to ask from the Church leadership etc.<br/><br/>There are other places in the USA or in other countries where victims have been invited by dioceses, by Provinces, by the leadership of the Church, to come forward. I have to say that overall I think there is a good will, and there are more people like bishops and provincials who listen to victims than we know. But there is no one model of giving victims not only the space to express themselves and be listened to, but also to engage actively in Church development.<br/><br/>In terms of setting up spaces for support for victims, what are some of the things you've seen that could really help — and that we could be considering here in Australia?<br/><br/>One of the major points that many victims bring up is, 'Can't we have, within parish settings, within schools settings, a regular conversation going on that includes survivors of abuse as regular members of a committee, a commission, a sounding board, a feedback group or something like that?' So that this voice is not only brought in on a specific occasion, or where a person feels like he or she is at a point to be able to speak out about it, but [is heard] on a regular basis — build that voice into the system.<br/><br/>That will help all of us. It will help survivors and victims because they will feel welcome and appreciated in the specific experience, and in the specific life challenges, that they went through. Secondly it will help the community at large, because we can at least make ourselves more and more sensitive to what the concerns and specific needs of survivors are — that can also talk to the needs of young people.<br/><br/>M: We have strong groups of survivors here in Australia who have been able to support each other through that process. But what you're saying is that we need some way of supporting those groups, and supporting those people, through our own institutions as well?<br/><br/>And I think we need to be creative. It will work for one school and one parish and one diocese in one way, and for others in a different way. Because the survivors with whom I am in constant contact, they have quite similar requests, and similar experiences in regard to being welcomed in the Church or not — feeling thrown out or dismissed. But they have also among themselves quite different expectations. So I have learned that you have also to be very forthcoming in accepting the differences in what this specific group, or this specific survivor, wants, requests and needs.<br/><br/>M: Survivors talk about wanting to have their stories heard and acknowledged. We've had the Royal Commission here in Australia, which provided an independent process where victims could come forward. Is there a need for something like that in terms of a truth, justice and reconciliation process for the Church internationally?<br/><br/>H: Yes, I think there is a need for that internationally. But I think first every local church needs to do its own homework. I don't see it happening very soon that some such council or commission would be established to look into this area for the whole Church. The Church has a membership of 1.3 billion people, and is present in 190 countries, with all kinds of differences in expectations concerning psychological, spiritual and financial support.<br/><br/>There is one thing that I have come across consistently in communicating with, working with and listening to victims, and that is that they want to be listened to. So if there was the feeling that victims were constantly being listened to — in Rome and elsewhere — I think that would give a great relief to many victims.<br/><br/>I think [Pope Francis'] concern, especially with regard to your question, is that the local churches do whatever they can so that victims will be listened to in that particular country. I have a list of people who want to speak to the Holy Father directly, and physically it is impossible. I was there in 2014 to translate for two German survivors who were chosen with two Irish and two English survivors when he received the six of them at home. He took the whole morning listening to them one after the other. For each one, he was there for 40 to 45 minutes. Were he to do this for every survivor he couldn't sleep anymore.<br/><br/>His example is modelling for the whole Catholic Church the way victims and survivors are received, welcomed and listened to. I think if the bishops and the provincials in this world, in all countries, followed his example, many survivors would be really appreciative of that.<br/><br/>Archbishop Diarmud Martin was recently quoted just before the World Meeting of Families, about the Pontifical Commission, saying that it's too small as it's currently set up to achieve what it needs to achieve. What's your take on that? Does the Church need to be putting more resources into how it's overseeing those issues?<br/><br/>At the moment we are 16 members from basically all continents, and the major language groups. We represent a variety of disciplines and professions, and the purpose of the commission — as the statutes that have just been promulgated state — is to provide counsel to the Holy Father.<br/><br/>A common misunderstanding about the commission is first that we deal with cases of allegations. That is not the case. We have no juridical or administrative power in regards to cases, because when it comes to allegations of abuse the tribunals and procedure are set.<br/><br/>A second misunderstanding is that we promote, directly, things on the ground. Our first and foremost goal is that we advise the Holy Father on issues.<br/><br/>So from my point of view, yes, we need to invest more. But we need to invest more on the local level, and we need to make sure that the proposals from the Pontifical Commission are forwarded to the Holy Father — which normally the President does — and then there is a follow-up process that reflects what we have given as our advice.<br/><br/>In Australia, Catholic Professional Standards Limited is overseeing the Church's response and providing guidelines and support for ensuring all the institutions in the Church are child-safe institutions. Is there a need for some kind of organisational support from Rome for those bishops and dioceses that are struggling to form these institutions and provide safeguarding in those dioceses?<br/><br/>I think ultimately the commission will develop in that line. They are now in the process of hiring experts in those areas.<br/><br/>I think the Church needs to understand that the local churches can learn from each other mutually. And my understanding has always been — and I think the Holy Father has reminded us — that the Church will not function as a centralised company. It does not work like that, effectively. Every bishop, every bishops conference, has, to some extent, its life on its own. What we need to learn more is to open channels of mutual communication.<br/><br/>There are a number of things that people blame for abuse in the Church. As a priest and a psychologist, and as someone who has met and worked with survivors, what are your thoughts on that issue?<br/><br/>I think the question of where does abuse come from is the most important one, and the Pope has addressed that in his letter to the people of God published on 20 August. He says in the first paragraph, and repeats it over and over again, that the question of sexual abuse is always linked — or almost always linked — not only to the question of abuse of power, but also to the abuse of conscience.<br/><br/>So the real fundamental question of abuse is much more complex than just [the question of] sexuality — be it heterosexual or homosexual. It's a power issue, and there we have to really work on the question of how do we understand priesthood, how to we understand bishophood, how do we understand and live out our ministries? What are the boundaries?<br/><br/>That's why I'm very happy that the Jesuit Province in Australia is establishing a Code of Conduct. Because we don't talk only about sexual abuse of minors. We talk about sexual abuse of adults, and we talk about abuse in other ways — like abuse of conscience, where you dictate to someone what you think, or you pretend to know by God, and you can tell another person, 'You need to do that', against the conscience of that person.<br/><br/>Many people think celibacy produces abuse. As I always say, celibacy as such is not cause for abusing — otherwise how do we explain that 99.9 per cent of all abusers do not live a celibate life, and how do we explain that 95 or 96 per cent of all priests do not abuse minors? But, celibacy, or a vow of chastity, that is not really integrated, that is not really lived out properly — yes, that produces a problem. Sometimes people take to drinking, sometime they take to gambling, and sometimes they take to sexual misconduct, with adults and with minors.<br/><br/>The real question about this is how do we deal with the notion of religious spiritual power with which priests and bishops are invested? How can theology help us to understand, and maybe how can sociology, psychology, or business administration help us to define the limits of power, and the necessity of keeping your boundaries | Q&A: Eksperti i mbrojtjes së Vatikanit Fr Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>13 qershor 2021<br/><br/>Fr Hans Zollner SJ. Fotografia: Jezuitët australianë.<br/><br/>Presidenti i Qendrës për Mbrojtjen e Fëmijëve në Universitetin Gregorian në Romë, dhe anëtar i Komisionit Papnor për Mbrojtjen e të Miturve, Fr Hans Zollner SJ, ishte në Australi në 2018 për të folur me udhëheqësit dhe të mbijetuarit e ministrisë katolike.<br/><br/>Michael McVeigh nga Jesuit Communications u ul bashkë me të gjatë vizitës për të eksploruar se si Kisha po i përgjigjet krizës së abuzimit ndërkombëtarisht, dhe se çfarë mund të mësohet nga përvojat tona në Australi.<br/><br/>MM: Ky është udhëtimi juaj i tretë në Australi. Ju keni vizituar mjaft vende të tjera për të parë se si Kisha po i përgjigjet abuzimit në mbarë botën.A mund të na jepni disa ide se si duket fotografia globale?<br/><br/>Fr Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>HZ: Të kuptuarit tim, pasi kam vizituar rreth 50 vende në pesë ose gjashtë kontinente, është se Kisha po fillon të lëvizë përgjatë dy viteve të fundit çështjen e të bërit drejtësi për viktimat, të dëgjimit të tyre dhe të bërit gjithçka që mund të bëhet në drejtim të ruajtjes.<br/><br/>Unë isha me Jesuit Provincialët nga e gjithë Afrika në fund të prillit dhe Presidenti i Asistencës së Jezuitëve të Afrikës dhe Madagaskarit është shumë i përkushtuar dhe i përkushtuar ndaj kësaj. Ai ka vendosur një plan të plotë veprimi për formimin dhe futjen e udhëzimeve në të gjithë vendin. Është një përpjekje shumë e kujdesshme dhe shumë e qëllimshme për të bërë gjithçka që mund të bëhet për t’u angazhuar në mënyrë proaktive si Jesuits në Afrikë – në një kontinent ku para pak vitesh e gjithë kjo ishte një gjuhë e huaj.<br/><br/>Një nga sfidat e përpjekjes për të zhvilluar këtë qasje globale është se keni të bëni me kaq shumë kultura dhe shumë kuptime të ndryshme. Si mund të bashkoni këtë dhe të përpiqeni të ofroni trajnime dhe të mbështesni komunitetet fetare që trajtojnë këto çështje?<br/><br/>Kjo është një nga pyetjet kryesore që kemi.Mendoj se ajo që mund të bëj është të nxis diskutime, të nxis reflektim dhe t’i përgatisë njerëzit sa më shumë që të jetë e mundur në mënyrë që ata të mund të bëjnë punën bazë.<br/><br/>Qendra për Mbrojtjen e Fëmijëve në Universitetin Gregorian nuk pretendon të ketë përgjigjen për çdo pyetje. Jo vetëm pse nuk i dimë kontekstet specifike – por mund të dimë disa prej tyre, por po flasim për mijëra kultura, po flasim për qindra gjuhë, po flasim për prejardhje ligjore shumë të ndryshme. Ai ndryshon ndonjëherë edhe brenda një vendi, të tilla si Australia ku keni shtete brenda Komonuelthit të Australisë që kanë ligje të ndryshme sesa shtetet e tjera.<br/><br/>Unë jam dikush që përpiqet të nxisë diskutime dhe reflektim.Unë jam gjithashtu shumë i lumtur për të dëgjuar njerëzit.<br/><br/>E përmendët nevojën për të dëgjuar dhe mbështetur viktimat dhe për t’u dëgjuar, ne padyshim kemi pasur Komisionin Mbretëror këtu në Australi, por cilat janë disa nga mënyrat e tjera që ju keni parë se zërat e viktimave po mbështeten në të gjithë botën?<br/><br/>Në Francë ka një dioqezë që ka krijuar atë që ata e quajnë 'Hapësirë e Dëgjimit'. Atje, viktimat mund të vijnë përpara dhe ata mund të shprehin vetveten. Është një hapësirë e hapur në të cilën njerëzit që janë lënduar jashtëzakonisht janë të lirë të paktën të shprehin atë që duan të pyesin nga udhëheqja e Kishës etj.<br/><br/>Ka vende të tjera në SHBA ose në vende të tjera ku viktimat janë ftuar nga dioqeza, nga Provincat, nga udhëheqja e Kishës, për të dalë përpara. Më duhet të them se në përgjithësi mendoj se ka një vullnet të mirë dhe ka më shumë njerëz si peshkopë dhe krahinorë që i dëgjojnë viktimat sesa e dimë. Por nuk ka asnjë model për t’i dhënë viktimave jo vetëm hapësirën për t’u shprehur dhe për t’u dëgjuar, por edhe për t’u angazhuar në mënyrë aktive në zhvillimin e Kishës.<br/><br/>Për sa i përket krijimit të hapësirave për mbështetje të viktimave, cilat janë disa nga gjërat që keni parë që mund të ndihmojnë vërtet – dhe që mund të kemi parasysh këtu në Australi?<br/><br/>Një nga pikat kryesore që shumë viktima sjellin është, ‘A nuk kemi, brenda parametrave të famullisë, brenda shkollave, një bisedë të rregullt që përfshin të mbijetuarit e abuzimit si anëtarë të rregullt të një komisioni, një komision, një bord zhurmues, një grup komentesh apo diçka të tillë?’ Që ky zë të mos hyjë vetëm në një rast të caktuar, ose kur një person ndihet sikur është në gjendje të flasë për këtë, por [dëgjohet] rregullisht – të ndërtohet ai zë në sistem.<br/><br/>Kjo do të ndihmojë të gjithë ne.Do të ndihmojë të mbijetuarit dhe viktimat sepse ata do të ndihen të mirëpritur dhe të vlerësuar në përvojën specifike dhe në sfidat specifike të jetës, që ata kaluan. Së dyti, kjo do ta ndihmojë komunitetin në përgjithësi, sepse të paktën mund ta bëjmë veten gjithnjë e më të ndjeshëm ndaj nevojave dhe nevojave specifike të të mbijetuarve – të cilat gjithashtu mund të flasin me nevojat e të rinjve.<br/><br/>M: Ne kemi grupe të forta të të mbijetuarish këtu në Australi që kanë qenë në gjendje të mbështesin njëri-tjetrin përmes këtij procesi. Por ajo që po thoni është se ne kemi nevojë për t’i mbështetur këto grupe dhe për t’i mbështetur ata njerëz, edhe përmes institucioneve tona?<br/><br/>Dhe mendoj se duhet të jemi krijues, do të funksionojë për një shkollë, një famulli dhe një dioqezë në një mënyrë dhe për të tjerët në një mënyrë tjetër. Për shkak se të mbijetuarit me të cilët jam në kontakt të vazhdueshëm, ata kanë kërkesa mjaft të ngjashme dhe përvoja të ngjashme në lidhje me të qenit të mirëpritur në Kishë apo jo – të flakur ose të shkarkuar. Por ata kanë edhe midis vetes edhe pritje krejt të ndryshme, ndaj kam mësuar që edhe ju duhet të jeni shumë në vijim në pranimin e dallimeve në atë që dëshiron ky grup specifik, apo ky i mbijetuar specifik, kërkon, kërkon dhe ka nevojë.<br/><br/>M: Të mbijetuarit flasin për dëshirën e tyre për të dëgjuar dhe pranuar historitë e tyre. Ne kemi pasur Komisionin Mbretëror këtu në Australi, i cili siguroi një proces të pavarur ku viktimat mund të vinin përpara. A ka nevojë për diçka të tillë sa i përket një procesi të vërtetë, drejtësie dhe pajtimi për Kishën ndërkombëtare?<br/><br/>H: Po, unë mendoj se ka nevojë për atë ndërkombëtarisht, por unë mendoj se së pari çdo kishë lokale duhet të bëjë detyrat e veta. Nuk e shoh që të ndodhë shumë shpejt që një këshill apo komision i tillë do të vendosej për të parë në këtë zonë për gjithë Kishën. Kisha ka një anëtarësim prej 1.3 miliardë njerëzve dhe është e pranishme në 190 vende, me të gjitha llojet e dallimeve në lidhje me mbështetjen psikologjike, shpirtërore dhe financiare.<br/><br/>Ekziston një gjë me të cilën kam hasur vazhdimisht në komunikim, në të punuar dhe dëgjuar viktima, dhe kjo është se ata duan të më dëgjojnë. Pra, nëse do të ekzistonte ndjenja se viktimat vazhdimisht do t’i dëgjonin – në Romë dhe gjetkë – mendoj se kjo do t’u jepte lehtësim të madh shumë viktimave.<br/><br/>Unë mendoj se shqetësimi [i Papa Françeskut] veçanërisht në lidhje me pyetjen tuaj, është se kishat lokale bëjnë çdo gjë që ata mund të bëjnë në mënyrë që viktimat të dëgjohen në atë vend të veçantë. Unë kam një listë të njerëzve që duan të flasin me Atin e Shenjtë direkt, dhe fizikisht kjo është e pamundur. Unë isha atje në 2014 për të përkthyer për dy të mbijetuarit gjermanë që u zgjodhën me dy të mbijetuarit irlandezë dhe dy anglezë kur ai i mori të gjashtët prej tyre në shtëpi. Ai mori të gjithë mëngjes duke i dëgjuar ata njëri pas tjetrit. Për secilin, ai ishte për 40 deri në 45 minuta. Po ta bënte këtë për çdo të mbijetuar që nuk mund të flinte më.<br/><br/>Shembulli i tij është modelimi i të gjithë Kishës Katolike mënyra se si pranohen, mirëpriten dhe dëgjojnë viktimat. Mendoj se nëse peshkopët dhe provincat në këtë botë, në të gjitha vendet, e ndoqën shembullin e tij, shumë të mbijetuar do të ishin me të vërtetë mirënjohës për këtë.<br/><br/>Kryepeshkopi Diarmud Martin u citua kohët e fundit para Takimit Botëror të familjeve, për Komisionin Papnor, duke thënë se është shumë i vogël pasi aktualisht është krijuar për të arritur atë që duhet për të arritur. A duhet të vendosë Kisha më shumë burime se si po i mbikëqyr këto çështje?<br/><br/>Për momentin ne jemi 16 anëtarë nga të gjitha kontinentet, dhe grupet kryesore të gjuhëve. Ne përfaqësojmë një sërë disiplinash dhe profesionesh, dhe qëllimi i komisionit – si statutet që sapo janë shpallur shtet – është t’i ofrojmë këshilla Atit të Shenjtë.<br/><br/>Një keqkuptim i zakonshëm në lidhje me komisionin është së pari se ne merremi me rastet e akuzave.Kjo nuk është rasti. Ne nuk kemi asnjë fuqi juridike ose administrative në lidhje me rastet, sepse kur bëhet fjalë për pretendimet e keqpërdorimit të rregullave dhe procedurës janë vendosur.<br/><br/>Një keqkuptim i dytë është se ne promovojmë, drejtpërdrejt, gjërat në terren.Qëllimi ynë i parë dhe kryesor është se ne këshillojmë Atin e Shenjtë për çështjet.<br/><br/>Pra, nga këndvështrimi im, po, ne duhet të investojmë më shumë. Por duhet të investojmë më shumë në nivel lokal, dhe duhet të sigurohemi që propozimet nga Komisioni Papnor t’i përcillen Atit të Shenjtë — i cili normalisht bën Presidenti — dhe pastaj ekziston një proces pasues që pasqyron atë që kemi dhënë si këshillën tonë.<br/><br/>Në Australi, Standardet Profesionale Katolike të Kufizuar po mbikëqyrin përgjigjen e Kishës dhe po ofrojnë udhëzime dhe mbështetje për sigurimin e të gjitha institucioneve në Kishë janë institucione të sigurta për fëmijët. A ka nevojë për një lloj mbështetje organizative nga Roma për ato peshkope dhe dioqeza që po luftojnë të formojnë këto institucione dhe të ofrojnë siguri në ato dioqeza?<br/><br/>Në fund të fundit, komisioni do të zhvillohet në atë linjë dhe tani ata janë në proces të punësimit të ekspertëve në ato fusha.<br/><br/>Mendoj se Kisha duhet të kuptojë që kishat lokale mund të mësojnë nga njëri-tjetri. Dhe të kuptuarit tim ka qenë gjithmonë — dhe mendoj se Ati i Shenjtë na ka kujtuar — që Kisha nuk do të funksionojë si një kompani e centralizuar. Nuk funksionon kështu, në mënyrë efektive.Çdo peshkop, çdo konferencë peshkopi, ka, në një farë mase jetën e vet. Ajo që duhet të mësojmë më shumë është hapja e kanaleve të komunikimit të ndërsjellë.<br/><br/>Ka disa gjëra që njerëzit fajësojnë për abuzime në Kishë. Si prift dhe psikolog, dhe si dikush që është takuar dhe ka punuar me të mbijetuarit, cilat janë mendimet tuaja për këtë çështje?<br/><br/>Mendoj se pyetja se nga vjen abuzimi është më i rëndësishmi, dhe Papa ka adresuar se në letrën e tij drejtuar popullit të Perëndisë të botuar më 20 gusht. Ai thotë në paragrafin e parë, dhe përsërit vazhdimisht se çështja e abuzimit seksual është gjithmonë e lidhur — ose pothuajse gjithmonë e lidhur — jo vetëm me çështjen e abuzimit të pushtetit, por edhe me abuzimin e ndërgjegjes.<br/><br/>Pra, pyetja themelore e abuzimit është shumë më komplekse sesa vetëm [pyetja] e seksualitetit – qoftë heteroseksual apo homoseksual. Është çështje e pushtetit, dhe duhet me të vërtetë të punojmë për pyetjen se si e kuptojmë priftërinë, si e kuptojmë ne peshkopin, si e kuptojmë dhe si jetojmë shërbesat tona?<br/><br/>Kjo është arsyeja pse unë jam shumë i lumtur që Provinca Jesuit në Australi po krijon një Kod Sjelljeje.Për shkak se ne nuk flasim vetëm për abuzimin seksual të të miturve. Ne flasim për abuzimin seksual të të rriturve, dhe ne flasim për abuzime në mënyra të tjera – si abuzimi i ndërgjegjes, ku ju diktoni dikë se çfarë mendoni, ose ju pretendoni se e njihni nga Zoti, dhe mund t’i thoni një personi tjetër: “Ju duhet ta bëni këtë”, kundër ndërgjegjes së atij personi.<br/><br/>Shumë njerëz mendojnë se beqaria prodhon abuzime. Siç them gjithnjë, beqaria si e tillë nuk është shkak për abuzime – përndryshe si mund të shpjegojmë se 99.99 përqind e të gjithë abuzuesit nuk jetojnë një jetë të qetë dhe si e shpjegojmë se 95 ose 96 përqind e të gjithë priftërinjve nuk abuzojnë me të miturit? Por, beqaria, ose betimi i dëlirësisë, që nuk është e integruar me të vërtetë, që nuk është jetuar si duhet – po, që prodhon një problem. Ndonjëherë njerëzit marrin për të pirë, ndonjëherë marrin bixhoz, dhe ndonjëherë marrin sjellje të gabuara seksuale, me të rritur dhe me të mitur.<br/><br/>Pyetja e vërtetë rreth kësaj është se si ta trajtojmë nocionin e fuqisë fetare shpirtërore me të cilin investohen priftërinjtë dhe peshkopët? Si mund të na ndihmojë teologjia për të kuptuar, dhe ndoshta si mund të na ndihmojë sociologjia, psikologjia ose administrata e biznesit të përcaktojmë kufijtë e pushtetit, dhe domosdoshmëria për të mbajtur kufijtë tuaj |
| I'm not surprised by this mismatch. In fact, I'd even go so far as to say this isn't something that will ever change, nor should we get all steamed up about changing it. In 10 years, we'll still have bleeding edge, complex items in the biggest concerns list, and the things we're finally getting around to understanding will be the major parts of our spending.<br/><br/>Now, Gunnar and Andy both have excellent points, specifically about IT teams seeing IT problems and solving them with IT solutions; in fact, I'm positive their points hold merit.<br/><br/>But I think there are other ideas that trump those (I did comment on their blogs about it, and later decided I should just blog here). Those top 3 concerns are bleedingly new such that:<br/><br/>we fear new things because we don't understand them, or don't understand them because they're new.<br/><br/>they're too new for us to have solid approaches to handling them.<br/><br/>they're too new for us to know if we should be worried or not! we tend to default to paranoid/worried, which is good!<br/><br/>too new to have obvious budget items assigned to them. Can I buy a box or some software that provide "cloud security" or "social media security?"<br/><br/>they're so new the business doesn't even know how to use them or what they want out of them. Let alone how we can secure them while still meeting or at least not stomping all over business needs. If the business doesn't even know how to use them yet, I'm not sure security is in any position to guide that usage securely.<br/><br/>It also should be mentioned that these new things are being largely pushed via consumerland and into the business, with IT as a sort of, "Oh yeah," thought. Firewalls, AV, AM, Auth are all IT responses to typically IT issues. Of course there is a difference there. They're also very subjective issues, as opposed to very objective items like firewalls, known malicious bits, behaviors, signatures, ports. Business presents very complex issues that are often involving people (which we can't patch) and that often don't fit nicely into blanket rules. Even if we turned away from technical solutions and devoted our time into solving these problems, they are still not going to be neatly solved. Likewise, when push comes to shove, can you have and meet goals with firewalls? Can you show improvement? All of this flows from the rather subjective non-technical aspect of those issues. Sort of the difference between a child's report card and the feedback you get from a parent-teacher conference. If you have a child, which one would you be most inclined to disagree with or not necessarily believe? (The answer is the subjective one!)<br/><br/>It could be said this is the natural progression of security and technology: from shoring up the technical controls to moving up the stack towards behavior and people. Sure, these 3 top concerns can be said to punch through firewalls and network segments, but that's the nature of those things (social media "punching" through a firewall is far different than me punching through an SSH connection to bridge my home network; social media is akin to the *way* I use my SSH connection after the hold is already punched because it is needed; i.e. social media is the way port 80 is used.)<br/><br/>Basically, all indications point to not being surprised by this dichotomy. And I don't think this is some further indication that IT/security is doing it wrong, or isn't aligned properly with business, or has a technical dark-server-room background. I'm not saying we're doing things right or we're properly aligned, but the above isn't a good argument to support the theory of those deficiencies.<br/><br/>Now for a really big jump. I'd liken the current increase in mobile computing to be as big as the introduction of computers into the business and later the PC/internet into business. Now, I wasn't around when the former happened, nor was I in the industry when the personal computer revolution swept into business, but I would bet that is the closest comparison so far. I may even say the same for social media. These are damned new and they're big changes beyond just bringing in Macs or new software or some new business process. | Unë nuk jam i befasuar nga kjo mospërputhje. Në fakt, unë do të shkoj aq larg sa të them se kjo nuk është diçka që do të ndryshojë ndonjëherë, dhe as nuk duhet të merrni të gjithë steamed për të ndryshuar atë. Në 10 vjet, ne ende do të kemi buzë gjakderdhja, sende komplekse në listën më të madhe të shqetësimeve, dhe gjërat që ne më në fund po i kuptojmë do të jenë pjesët kryesore të shpenzimeve tona.<br/><br/>Tani, Gunnar dhe Andy të dyja kanë pika të shkëlqyera, veçanërisht për ekipet e IT-së duke parë problemet e IT-së dhe duke i zgjidhur ato me zgjidhje të IT-së; në fakt, unë jam pozitiv pikat e tyre mbajnë meritë.<br/><br/>Por mendoj se ka ide të tjera që i kanë komentuar ato (i kam komentuar në blogjet e tyre, dhe më vonë kam vendosur që duhet vetëm të blogoj këtu). Këto 3 shqetësime kryesore janë kryesisht të reja që:<br/><br/>ne kemi frikë gjëra të reja, sepse ne nuk i kuptojmë ato, ose nuk i kuptojnë ato, sepse ato janë të reja.<br/><br/>ato janë shumë të reja për ne që të ketë qasje të ngurta për trajtimin e tyre.<br/><br/>ata janë shumë të reja për ne të dini nëse ne duhet të jenë të shqetësuar apo jo! ne kemi tendencë për të parazgjedhur të paranojak / shqetësuar, e cila është e mirë!<br/><br/>mund të blej një kuti apo ndonjë softuer që ofron "siguri në renë kompjuterike" ose "sigurinë në median sociale?"<br/><br/>Ata janë kaq të rinj, biznesi nuk di as si t’i përdorë apo çfarë duan prej tyre., Le më pak se si mund t’i sigurojmë ata ndërkohë që takohen ose të paktën të mos pengohen në të gjitha nevojat e biznesit. Nëse biznesi nuk di as si t’i përdorë ato, unë nuk jam i sigurt se siguria është në asnjë pozicion për të udhëhequr atë përdorim të sigurt.<br/><br/>Gjithashtu duhet përmendur se këto gjëra të reja po shtyhen kryesisht përmes konsumatorit dhe në biznes, me IT si një lloj, "Oh po," mendimi Firewalls, AV, AM, Aut janë të gjitha përgjigjet IT për çështjet zakonisht IT. Sigurisht ka një ndryshim atje. Ata janë gjithashtu çështje shumë subjektive, në krahasim me sende shumë objektive si firewalls, bits njohur me qëllim të keq, sjelljet, nënshkrimet, portet. Biznesi paraqet çështje shumë komplekse që shpesh përfshijnë njerëzit (të cilët ne nuk mund të azhornojmë) dhe që shpesh nuk përshtaten bukur në rregullat e batanijeve. Edhe nëse ne i larguam zgjidhjet teknike dhe i kushtuam kohës sonë zgjidhjes së këtyre problemeve, ata ende nuk do të zgjidhen mjeshtërisht.Po kështu, kur të vijë shtytja, a mund të kesh dhe të takosh qëllime me firewalls? A mund të tregosh përmirësim? Të gjitha këto rrjedhë nga aspekti subjektiv joteknik i këtyre çështjeve, një lloj dallimi ndërmjet kartës së raportimit të fëmijës dhe reagimeve që merrni nga një konferencë prindërore. Nëse keni një fëmijë, me të cilin do të ishit më të prirur për të rënë dakord ose nuk do të besonit domosdoshmërisht? (Përgjigja është subjektive!)<br/><br/>Mund të thuhet se kjo është përparimi natyror i sigurisë dhe teknologjisë: nga ndarja e kontrolleve teknike deri te lëvizja e pirgjeve drejt sjelljes dhe njerëzve. Sigurisht, këto 3 shqetësime kryesore mund të thuhet se do të mposhten muret dhe segmentet e rrjetit, por kjo është natyra e këtyre gjërave (kurrja e mediave sociale është shumë e ndryshme nga ajo e zjarrit përmes një lidhjeje SSH për të mbushur rrjetin tim të shtëpisë; mediat sociale janë të ngjashme me *rrugën * Unë përdor lidhjen time SSH pasi ajo tashmë është e nevojshme; d.m.th mediat sociale janë porti i rrugës 80 është përdorur.)<br/><br/>Në thelb, të gjitha indikacionet tregojnë se nuk befasohet nga kjo dikotomi. Dhe unë nuk mendoj se kjo është disa tregues të mëtejshme se IT / siguria po e bën gabim, ose nuk është në përputhje siç duhet me biznesin, ose ka një sfond teknik në dhomë me server të errët. Nuk po them se po i bëjmë gjërat siç duhet ose jemi në përputhje të duhur, por më lart nuk është një argument i mirë për të mbështetur teorinë e atyre mangësive.<br/><br/>Tani për një kërcim vërtet të madh.Unë do të doja që rritja aktuale e informatikës në celular të ishte aq e madhe sa futja e kompjuterëve në biznes dhe më vonë e PC/internetit në biznes. Tani, nuk isha afër kur ndodhi e para, dhe as që isha në industri kur revolucioni personal kompjuterik hyri në biznes, por do të bastoja që është krahasimi më i afërt deri më tani. Këto janë të mallkuara të reja dhe ato janë ndryshime të mëdha përtej dërgimit në Macs ose softuer të ri ose një procesi të ri biznesi. |
