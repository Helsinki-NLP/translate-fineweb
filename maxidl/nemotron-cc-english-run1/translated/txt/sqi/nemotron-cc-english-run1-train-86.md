| Leclaire<br/><br/>The historic Leclaire neighborhood, once referred to as Edwardsville's "suburb to the south," was founded as a cooperative community in 1890 and remained a separate village until annexed to the city of Edwardsville in 1934. Newspapers and magazines throughout the United States and Europe reported on the Leclaire experiment, particularly during the first 20 years of its existence. In 1979, due to its unique history, the former village was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.<br/><br/>Leclaire was founded by Nelson Oliver Nelson, a St. Louis plumbing manufacturer who, for many years, sought to advance the plight of the working class. Nelson wanted to improve working conditions for his employees and provide housing near the factories so workers and their families could easily participate in recreational and educational programs offered free of charge by the company. Prior to 1890, while still in St. Louis, the N. O. Nelson Company's manufacturing and distribution businesses began providing profit sharing along with educational and recreational opportunities. The Leclaire cooperative experiment would bring additional benefits.<br/><br/>When Nelson employees indicated they wanted to relocate to a rural location, company representatives approached leaders of small towns in several Missouri and Illinois communities near their St. Louis headquarters. They were looking for a suitable property to build new factories and a model village. South of Edwardsville they found a 125-acre tract of land with access to water, coal, and transportation. Local businessmen acted quickly to offer a financial incentive. In less than three weeks, the community raised a fund of $20,000 from individual contributions of between $1 and $1,000 to entice Nelson to choose Edwardsville for his enterprise.<br/><br/>City leaders had hoped to locate property inside the city limits of Edwardsville, but when no suitable site could be found, they were confident that the Nelson investment south of town would soon become a part of Edwardsville. Although Nelson fulfilled all the contingencies for construction and job creation in his contract, it would be 44 years before annexation to Edwardsville. Leclaire, bounded by Madison/Brown Avenues to the east, the railroad tracks to the west, Hadley/McKinley Avenues on the south and Wolf Street to the north, remained an independent village from 1890 to 1934. During that time it earned a reputation for innovations in business, education and residential planning.<br/><br/>The village of Leclaire on a 1931 map of Edwardsville<br/>Courtesy of Paul Jenkins<br/><br/>Nelson's decision to build a village was not made on a whim. By the late 1880s he was an international leader in the fields of cooperation and profit-sharing, exchanging social theories with others around the world while expanding his St. Louis business. He named his experimental village after the Parisian profit-sharer, Edme Jean Leclaire, but he visited many other social visionaries who provided information and inspiration. Compiling the best ideas from these examples, Nelson founded Leclaire to, in his words, "give work, promote intelligence, provide recreation, foster beauty, and make homes." These were all factors he determined necessary for men to lead fulfilling lives. Later writers used these words to formulate Leclaire's founding principles: Work, Homes, Education, Recreation, and Beauty, but with the additional important principle of Freedom.<br/><br/>Work<br/><br/>Work could be considered the most important of these factors since without the factory jobs in Leclaire, there would be no village. The brick factory buildings were designed by architect E. A. Cameron to provide natural light, ventilation in the summer, and heated floors in the winter. There was a fire suppression system and, although industrial accidents were not eliminated, every effort was made to guarantee the safety of the workers. The ivy-covered brick buildings were surrounded by well-manicured lawns and flower gardens giving the complex a campus-like appearance. In 1894, New York World reporter Nellie Bly called the buildings "the ideal perfection of buildings for man to labor in".<br/><br/>The manufacturing complex of the N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company in Leclaire<br/>From Friends of Leclaire<br/><br/>Nelson company policies were designed to protect the financial stability of employees. Workers could earn a share of the profits and have a voice in the company if they chose that option. The profit-sharing plan gave Nelson employees a pride of ownership that resulted in a supportive workforce. There were a few short-lived labor strikes over the years, but for the most part, labor problems were rare. Workers also had reasonable hours and competitive wages. There was a provident fund that provided for pensions and sick leave, as well as widow pensions if a worker died, whether or not the death was related to his employment.<br/><br/>Company headquarters for the N. O. Nelson Company (NONCO) remained in St. Louis, but all of the N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company was moved to Leclaire. The manufacturing company was divided into shops that made a variety of products. In 1900, the shops became independent companies for tax purposes, but all were still owned by the N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company. The shops included the Cabinet Mill where wood products from cabinetry to millwork were produced. The skilled craftsmen that worked here also fulfilled special contracts, including teller cages for a local bank and an altar still in use at St. Andrew's Episcopal Church in Edwardsville. The Marble Shop specialized in architectural marble that was cut and installed by Nelson crews in homes, businesses, and even state capitols throughout the Midwest. The Machine Shop, which became Bignall and Keeler, made pipe fitting machines, pumps, gauges, and various mechanical tools expected in the plumbing trade. They also branched out to manufacture specialty items like the Leclaire Bicycle in the mid-1890s. The Brass Shop included a foundry where various plumbing pipes and tools were manufactured. These examples represent just some of the work done in the Leclaire factories. The company's logo was a stylized "NONCO" that can still be seen on plumbing fixtures and some fire hydrants in Edwardsville today.<br/><br/>Homes<br/><br/>Before homes could be built, housing was needed for workers who were completing the factory buildings as well as building homes. To meet those needs, the company built the "Club House," a large building that served many purposes. In addition to lodging, it was the community's first educational building, and it contained a well-stocked library.<br/><br/>Construction of the residential portion of Leclaire began immediately after the village was founded in June of 1890. Julius Pitzman, the innovative landscape architect who laid out the first lots in Leclaire, set them up with a number of protective covenants. The covenants provided for wide, curvilinear streets, large lots, and a deed restriction that limited the properties to residential or educational purposes only. The company paved the streets, provided electric street lights, installed sidewalks, and planted hundreds of trees along the streets of Leclaire. Later sections of Leclaire were laid out with a conventional grid design and smaller lots, but still included the deed restrictions.<br/><br/>A Leclaire Victorian cottage in 1907<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Initially the homes were built by the company and then sold at near cost to Nelson employees to encourage home ownership. If a worker became ill and could not make his mortgage, payments were suspended until after he returned to work. The homes were offered in a variety of house designs and the company advertised that no two dwellings were alike. The earliest homes were primarily Victorian cottages that came with electricity and running water. These were followed by bungalows, foursquares, and even some kit homes. Residents could purchase a company-built home or buy an empty lot and build a house themselves, provided the architectural design met company standards.<br/><br/>In later years, lots were sold to investors, usually Edwardsville residents, and many homes in the 1920s were built by local contractors who then sold them to area residents.<br/><br/>Education<br/><br/>Nelson believed in education for everyone, including the working class. Educational programming began with a kindergarten at the Club House in 1892 and continued in the new educational building at 722 Holyoake Road. Commonly called the "School House," this building provided a large hall for meetings and programs, but had moveable partitions to divide it into classroom space during the day. In the evenings, there were dances, meetings, or programs of the Leclaire Self-Culture Club which featured weekly lectures by Washington University professors or nationally known speakers who, like N. O. Nelson, were part of the social betterment movement at the turn of the century. These included Jane Addams, Edward Everett Hale, Samuel "Golden Rule" Jones, and author Charlotte Perkins Gilman, among others.<br/><br/>Children enrolled in the Leclaire kindergarten in 1913<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>In the ten years following the 1895 construction of the education building, there were a series of educational experiments including an industrial school, college, night school, and an academy. The earliest and longest-lived endeavor was the morning kindergarten, founded in 1892, that used the Fröbel Model. This two-year program was free to everyone, including Edwardsville children, until 1931 when for financial reasons the company began charging tuition to students who were not the children of employees. Nelson Manufacturing operated a kindergarten until 1934 when the building was turned over to the Edwardsville School District for a nominal fee.<br/><br/>Recreation<br/><br/>Boaters on Leclaire Lake in 1915<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Recreation was an important feature of Leclaire. The company provided sports facilities for baseball, tennis, and later, football. A bowling and billiard hall was constructed and there was a lake for boating, swimming, fishing, or ice skating in winter. Leclaire Park was furnished with boathouses, male & female bath houses, and a large pavilion. Residents organized dances, hayrides, spelling bees, and other activities, and the company sponsored a band that played regularly at entertainments in the village or in Edwardsville. Like the educational functions at the Club House and School House, the recreational facilities at Leclaire were open to all and were often a destination for Edwardsville and even St. Louis visitors.<br/><br/>Beauty<br/><br/>Early photograph of Leclaire Lake<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>The last of the factors Nelson deemed important for a satisfying life concerned the environment. Nelson knew about the importance of healthy living. He valued the beauty and cleanliness that could be found in the country, and encouraged all in Leclaire to beautify their property by planting gardens and orchards. Nelson himself led by example, so a company greenhouse provided free flowers and competitions were held for the most beautiful yards. Leclaire was laid out so that the entire village had a park-like setting still evident today.<br/><br/>Freedom<br/><br/>The Leclaire Cooperative store<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Nelson listed five founding principles for Leclaire, but modern writers add a sixth: Freedom. All of the programs offered by the company were available to employees as well as local residents, but none were mandatory. The freedom to choose whether or not to participate in company programs was entirely up to the individual. Residents of Leclaire could work for Nelson Manufacturing or elsewhere, and workers were under no obligation to live in Leclaire. Participation in recreational and educational programs was also optional. There was also a company store where employees could shop, but unlike other company towns, no one was in debt to the company store. The Leclaire Store was a cooperative where members were charged fair market prices, but were then paid quarterly dividends.<br/><br/>A Different Company Town<br/><br/>All of these benefits made Leclaire unique from other company towns. But there were also individual instances where the company showed compassion and care for the employees. The company closed the factories and hired excursion trains to take workers and their families to St. Louis for a day at the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair. When money was tight, Nelson would occasionally place extra cash in each pay envelope to make life easier for workers, and if he instituted a program the men did not agree with, they talked it out and, as often as not, Nelson would reverse himself.<br/><br/>Born in Lillesand, Norway, in 1841, N. O. Nelson was a complicated man. He was a capitalist who believed in free enterprise, but also a socialist, a follower of the "Golden Rule", and a patriot who served for the Union in the Civil War. By 1900, he was a multimillionaire, but by the time of his death in 1922, he had given it all away for the betterment of the working class.<br/><br/>Although Leclaire was not Nelson's only social experiment, it is considered his most successful endeavor. Other major efforts for social betterment included a chain of co-operative grocery stores in New Orleans, a kindergarten for the children of black employees in his Bessemer, Alabama, factories, and a home for consumptives in Indio, California.<br/><br/>Nelson's Village of Leclaire was renowned internationally as a noteworthy and successful experiment. It was described in the New York World on numerous occasions but in particular by reporter Nellie Bly in 1894 who wrote at length about the model town where "The labor question is solved and everybody happy in a little village near St. Louis." The Los Angeles Times also regularly reported on N. O. Nelson, as did the Chicago Daily Tribune and numerous other publications.<br/><br/>In a speech at Leclaire's 15th anniversary celebration in 1915, Nelson said, "Leclaire extends to you a wide open hospitality, and bids you enjoy today the ease and comfort and beauty and inspiration which we enjoy every day." More than a century has passed since that day, but the invitation still stands. Residents and researchers are invited to learn about Leclaire's history and consider the lessons that might be learned for the betterment of future generations.<br/><br/>One of the former buildings of the manufacturing complex in 2019, which now serves as the N. O. Nelson Campus of Lewis and Clark Community College<br/>Photo by Ben Ostermeier<br/><br/>Friends of Leclaire, organized in 1990 following Leclaire's Centennial celebration, promotes the history of Leclaire through a website (historic-leclaire.org), publications, and a festival, Leclaire Parkfest, held annually on the third Sunday in October | Leclaire<br/><br/>Lagjja historike Leclaire, e përmendur dikur si "nën periferia e Edwardsville" u themelua si një komunitet bashkëpunues në vitin 1890 dhe mbeti një fshat i veçantë deri sa u aneksua në qytetin e Edwardsville në 1934. Gazetat dhe revistat në të gjithë Shtetet e Bashkuara dhe Evropë raportuan për eksperimentin me Leclaire, veçanërisht gjatë 20 viteve të para të ekzistencës së saj. Në vitin 1979, për shkak të historisë së tij unike, ish-fshati u rendit në Regjistrin Kombëtar të Vendeve Historike.<br/><br/>Leclaire u themelua nga Nelson Oliver Nelson, një prodhues hidraulik i St. Louis, i cili, prej shumë vitesh kërkoi të avancojë gjendjen e klasës punëtore. Nelsoni dëshironte të përmirësonte kushtet e punës për punonjësit e tij dhe të siguronte strehim pranë fabrikave në mënyrë që punonjësit dhe familjet e tyre të mund të merrnin pjesë lehtësisht në programet rekreative dhe arsimore të ofruara pa pagesë nga kompania. Para vitit 1890, ndërsa ende në St. Louis, bizneset e prodhimit dhe shpërndarjes së N. O. Nelson Company filluan të siguronin ndarjen e fitimeve së bashku me mundësitë arsimore dhe rekreative. Eksperimenti bashkëpunues i Leclaire do të sillte përfitime shtesë.<br/><br/>Kur punonjësit e Nelsonit treguan se donin të zhvendoseshin në një vend rural, përfaqësuesit e kompanisë iu afruan drejtuesve të qyteteve të vogla në disa komunitetet Missouri dhe Illinois pranë selisë së tyre St. Louis. Ata po kërkonin një pronë të përshtatshme për të ndërtuar fabrika të reja dhe një fshat model.Në jug të Edwardsville ata gjetën një trakt tokësor prej 125 hektarësh me qasje në ujë, qymyr dhe transport. Në më pak se tre javë, komuniteti ngriti një fond prej $ 20,000 nga kontributet individuale të midis $ 1 dhe $ 1,000 për të nxitur Nelsonin të zgjedhë Edwardsville për ndërmarrjen e tij.<br/><br/>Drejtuesit e qytetit kishin shpresuar të lokalizonin pronat brenda kufijve të qytetit të Edwardsville, por kur nuk mund të gjendeshin në një vend të përshtatshëm, ata kishin besim se investimi i Nelsonit në jug të qytetit së shpejti do të bëhej pjesë e Edwardsville. Megjithëse Nelsoni i përmbushi të gjitha rrethanat për ndërtimin dhe krijimin e vendeve të punës në kontratën e tij, kjo do të ishte 44 vjet para aneksimit të Edwardsville. Leclaire, i kufizuar nga Madison/Brown Avenues në lindje, gjurmët hekurudhore në perëndim, Hadley/McKinley Avenues në jug dhe Wolf Street në veri, mbeti një fshat i pavarur nga 1890 në 1934. Gjatë asaj kohe fitoi një reputacion për risitë në biznes, arsim dhe planifikim rezidencial.<br/><br/>Fshati Leclaire në një hartë të Edwardsville 1931<br/>Courtey e Paul Jenkins<br/><br/>Vendimi i Nelsonit për të ndërtuar një fshat nuk u bë me himn. Deri në fund të viteve 1880 ai ishte lider ndërkombëtar në fushën e bashkëpunimit dhe ndarjes së fitimeve, duke shkëmbyer teoritë sociale me të tjerët në mbarë botën ndërsa zgjeronte biznesin e tij St. Louis. Ai e quajti fshatin e tij eksperimental pas fitimit parisian-sharer, Edme Jean Leclaire, por ai vizitoi shumë vizionarë të tjerë shoqërorë që dhanë informacione dhe frymëzim. Duke përpiluar idetë më të mira nga këto shembuj, Nelsoni e themeloi Leclaire, sipas fjalëve të tij, “jep punë, promovo inteligjencën, siguron rekreacionin, mbreslën bukurinë dhe bën shtëpitë.” Këto ishin të gjithë faktorët që ai i vendosi të nevojshme që njerëzit të bënin jetë përmbushëse. Më vonë shkrimtarët përdorën këto fjalë për të formuluar parimet themeluese të Leclaire: Puna, Shtëpitë, Edukimi, Rekreacioni dhe Bukuria, por me parimin shtesë të rëndësishëm të Lirisë.<br/><br/>Punë<br/><br/>Puna mund të konsiderohet si më e rëndësishmja prej këtyre faktorëve pasi pa punët e fabrikës në Leclaire, nuk do të kishte fshat. Ndërtesat e fabrikës së tullave u projektuan nga arkitekti E. A. Cameron për të siguruar dritë natyrore, ventilim në verë dhe kate të nxehta në dimër. Kishte një sistem shtypjeje nga zjarri dhe, megjithëse aksidentet industriale nuk u eliminuan, u bë çdo përpjekje për të garantuar sigurinë e punëtorëve. Ndërtesat me tulla të mbuluara nga dredhitë ishin të rrethuara nga lëndinë të mirë manikuluar dhe kopshte lulesh duke i dhënë kompleksit një pamje të ngjashme me kampusin.Në 1894, gazetari i New York World, Nellie Byly, i quajti ndërtesat "përsosur në mënyrë ideale për njerëzit në punë".<br/><br/>Kompleksi prodhues i N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company në Leclaire<br/>Nga Miqtë e Leclaire<br/><br/>Politikat e kompanisë Nelson ishin të dizajnuara për të mbrojtur stabilitetin financiar të punonjësve.Punëtorët mund të fitonin një pjesë të fitimeve dhe të kishin një zë në kompani nëse ata e zgjodhën atë opsion. Plani i ndarjes së fitimeve u dha punonjësve të Nelsonit një krenari që rezultoi në një fuqi punëtore mbështetëse. Kishte disa goditje pune jetëshkurtra ndër vite, por në pjesën më të madhe problemet e punës ishin të rralla. Punëtorët gjithashtu kishin orë të arsyeshme dhe paga konkurruese. Kishte një fond të kujdesshëm që siguronte pensione dhe leje të sëmurë, si dhe pensione të ve, nëse një punëtor vdiq, nëse vdekja ishte e lidhur ose jo me punësimin e tij.<br/><br/>Selia e kompanisë për N. O. Nelson Company (NONCO) mbeti në St. Louis, por kompania N. O. Nelson ka arritur të lëvizë në Leclaire.Kompania prodhuese është ndarë në dyqane që kanë bërë një shumëllojshmëri produktesh. Në vitin 1900, dyqanet u bënë kompani të pavarura për qëllime tatimore, por të gjitha ishin ende në pronësi të N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company. Dyqanet përfshinin Kabinetin Mill ku u prodhuan produkte druri nga zdrukthtari në mullirin e drurit. Artizanët e aftë që kanë punuar këtu gjithashtu kanë kryer kontrata të veçanta, duke përfshirë kafaze tregues për një bankë lokale dhe një altar ende në përdorim në kishën Episkopale të Shën Andreut në Edwardsville. Dyqani i Mermerit i specializuar në mermerin arkitektonik që u preu dhe u instalua nga ekipet e Nelsonit në shtëpi, biznese, madje edhe në kapital shtetëror në të gjithë Midwest. Dyqani i makinerive, i cili u bë Bignall dhe Keeler, bëri makineri montimi të tubave, pompa, matës dhe mjete të ndryshme mekanike të pritura në tregtinë e hidraulikëve.Ata gjithashtu u degëzuan për të prodhuar artikuj specialiteti si Biçikleta Leclaire në mes të viteve 1890. Dyqani i tunxhit përfshinte një shkritore ku ishin prodhuar tuba dhe mjete të ndryshme hidraulike.Këto shembuj përfaqësojnë vetëm disa nga punimet e bëra në fabrikat e Leclaire. Logoja e kompanisë ishte e stilizuar "NONCO" që ende mund të shihet në pajisjet hidraulike dhe disa hidrat zjarri në Edwardsville sot.<br/><br/>Shtëpi<br/><br/>Përpara se të mund të ndërtohej shtëpitë, strehimi ishte i nevojshëm për punëtorët që po plotësonin objektet e fabrikës si dhe për ndërtimin e shtëpive.Për të përmbushur ato nevoja, kompania ndërtoi "Shtëpia e Klubit", një ndërtesë të madhe që i shërbeu shumë qëllimeve. Përveç strehimit, ajo ishte ndërtesa e parë arsimore e komunitetit, dhe ai përmbante një bibliotekë të pajisur mirë.<br/><br/>Ndërtimi i pjesës rezidenciale të Leclaire filloi menjëherë pasi fshati u themelua në qershor të vitit 1890. Jul Pitzman, arkitekti inovativ i peizazhit, i cili vendosi pjesën e parë në Leclaire, i ngriti ato me një numër besëlidhjesh mbrojtëse. Konventat e ofruara për rrugë të gjera, kurvilineare, shumë të mëdha dhe një kufizim të vlerës që kufizonte pronat vetëm për qëllime banimi ose arsimore. Kompania i hapi rrugët, siguroi dritat elektrike në rrugë, instalimin e trotuareve dhe mbolli qindra pemë përgjatë rrugëve të Leclaire. Më vonë seksionet e mëvonshme të Leclaire janë paraqitur me një dizajn tradicional të rrjetit dhe shumë më të vogla, por ende përfshinin kufizimet e veprave.<br/><br/>Një Leclaire Victorian vilë në 1907<br/>Nga Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Fillimisht shtëpitë u ndërtuan nga kompania dhe më pas u shitën me kosto të afërt punonjësve të Nelsonit për të inkurajuar pronësinë e shtëpisë.Nëse një punëtor u sëmur dhe nuk mund të bënte hipotekën e tij, pagesat u pezulluan derisa ai u kthye në punë. Shtëpitë u ofruan në një larmi projektimesh shtëpish dhe kompania reklamoi se nuk kishte dy banesa.Dhomat më të hershme ishin kryesisht vila viktoriane që vinin me energji elektrike dhe ujë të rrjedhshëm. Këto u pasuan nga bungalows, foursquares, madje edhe disa shtëpi kiti.Banesat mund të blinin një shtëpi të ndërtuar nga një kompani ose të blinin një shumë bosh dhe të ndërtonin vetë një shtëpi, me kusht që dizajni arkitektonik të plotësonte standardet e kompanisë.<br/><br/>Në vitet e mëvonshme, shumë u shitën investitorëve, zakonisht banorët e Edwardsville dhe shumë shtëpi në vitet 1920 u ndërtuan nga kontraktorët lokalë të cilët më pas i shitën ata në zona banorë.<br/><br/>Arsimi<br/><br/>Nelsoni besonte ne edukimin per te gjithe, duke perfshire edhe klasen e punes. Programimi arsimor filloi me nje kopsht ne Shtëpinë e Klubeve ne vitin 1892 dhe vazhdoi me nje ndertim te ri edukativ ne Rrugen Holoake 722. Zakonisht i quajtur "Shtëpia e Shkollës", kjo ndërtesë ofronte një sallë të madhe për takime dhe programe, por kishte ndarje të lëvizshme për ta ndarë në hapësirë mësimi gjatë ditës. Në mbrëmje, kishte valle, mbledhje apo programe të Klubit të Self-Culture të Leclaire i cili paraqiste ligjërata javore nga profesorë të Universitetit të Uashingtonit ose folës të njohur kombëtar, të cilët, si N. O. Nelson, ishin pjesë e lëvizjes së përmirësimit social në fund të shekullit. Këto përfshinin Jane Addams, Edward Everett Hale, Samuel "Golden Rule" Jones, dhe autori Charlotte Perkins Gilman, ndër të tjera.<br/><br/>Fëmijët e regjistruar në kopshtin e Leclaire në vitin 1913<br/>Nga Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Në dhjetë vitet pas ndërtimit të godinës së arsimit të vitit 1895, pati një sërë eksperimentesh edukative, duke përfshirë një shkollë industriale, kolegj, shkollë të natës dhe një akademi. Përpjekja më e hershme dhe jetëgjatë ishte kopshti i mëngjesit, i themeluar në 1892, që përdorte modelin Fröbel. Ky program dy-vjeçar ishte i lirë për të gjithë, duke përfshirë edhe fëmijët Edwardsville, deri në vitin 1931 kur për arsye financiare kompania filloi të karikonte shkollim për studentët që nuk ishin fëmijët e punonjësve. Prodhimi i Nelsonit funksionoi nje kopsht deri ne 1934 kur ndërtesa u kthye ne Rrethin Shkollor Edwardsville me nje pagese nominale.<br/><br/>Rekreacioni<br/><br/>Boaters në Liqenin Leclaire në 1915<br/>Nga Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Rekreacioni ishte një tipar i rëndësishëm i Leclaire.Kompania ofroi objekte sportive për bejsboll, tenis dhe më vonë, futboll.Një sallë bowling dhe bilardos ishte një liqen për shëtitje, not, peshkim, ose patinazh në akull në dimër. Parku Leclaire është mobiluar me anije, shtëpi banjoje mashkullore dhe femërore dhe një pavijon të madh. Banorët organizonin valle, hamidie, bletët drejtshkrimit dhe aktivitete të tjera, dhe kompania sponsorizoi një grup që luante rregullisht në argëtime në fshat ose në Edwardsville. Ashtu si funksionet edukative në Shtëpinë e Klubit dhe në Shtëpinë e Shkollës, objektet rekreative në Leclaire ishin të hapura për të gjithë dhe shpesh ishin një destinacion për Edwardsville dhe madje edhe Shën Louis vizitorë.<br/><br/>Bukuria<br/><br/>Fotografia e hershme e Liqenit të Leclaire<br/>Nga Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Faktorët e fundit të Nelsonit e konsideruan të rëndësishëm për një jetë të kënaqshme sa i përket mjedisit jetësor. Nelsoni e dinte për rëndësinë e të jetuarit të shëndetshëm. Ai vlerësoi bukurinë dhe pastërtinë që mund të gjenden në vend, dhe inkurajoi të gjithë në Leclaire të zbukurojnë pronën e tyre duke mbjellë kopshte dhe pemishte. Vetë Nelsoni u drejtua me p.sh., një serë kompanish me lule dhe gara te lira u zhvilluan per kopshtet me te bukura. Leclaire u nxore ne menyre qe i gjithe fshati te kishte nje vend parkimi te dukshem edhe sot e kesaj dite.<br/><br/>Liria<br/><br/>Dyqan Kooperativa Leclaire<br/>Nga Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Nelsoni renditi pesë parimet themeluese për Leclaire, por shkrimtarët modernë shtojnë një të gjashtën: Lirinë.Të gjitha programet e ofruara nga kompania ishin në dispozicion të punonjësve si dhe të banorëve vendas, por asnjëra nuk ishte e detyrueshme. Liria për të zgjedhur nëse do të merrnin pjesë ose jo në programet e kompanisë ishte tërësisht në dorën e individit. Banorët e Leclaire mund të punonin për Prodhimin e Nelsonit ose diku tjetër, dhe punëtorët nuk ishin të detyruar të jetonin në Leclaire. Pjesëmarrja në programe rekreative dhe arsimore ishte gjithashtu fakultative. Kishte gjithashtu një dyqan kompanish ku punonjësit mund të blinin, por ndryshe nga qytetet e tjera të kompanisë, askush nuk ishte në borxh ndaj dyqanit të kompanisë. Dyqani Leclaire ishte një bashkëpunëtor ku anëtarë ishin të ngarkuar me çmime të drejta tregu, por më pas u paguan tremujorë dividendë.<br/><br/>Një tjetër qytet i kompanisë<br/><br/>Të gjitha këto përfitime e bënë Leclaire unike nga qytete të tjera të kompanisë, por ka pasur edhe raste individuale ku kompania tregoi dhembshuri dhe kujdes për punonjësit. Kompania mbylli fabrikat dhe rekrutoi trena ekskursionesh për të marrë punëtorë dhe familjet e tyre në Shën Luigj për një ditë në Panairin e Shën Luigjit Botëror të vitit 1904. Kur paratë ishin të ngushta, Nelsoni herë pas here do të vendoste para shtesë në secilën zarf të paguar për ta bërë jetën më të lehtë për punëtorët, dhe nëse ai krijoi një program me të cilin burrat nuk pajtohen, ata e folën atë dhe, sa më shpesh, Nelsoni do të ndryshonte veten.<br/><br/>I lindur në Lillesand, Norvegji, në 1841, N. O. Nelson ishte një njeri i ndërlikuar, i cili besonte në sipërmarrjen e lirë, por edhe një socialist, një pasues i "Rregullës së Artë" dhe një patriot që shërbeu për Bashkimin në Luftën Civile. Deri në vitin 1900, ai ishte një milioner, por në kohën e vdekjes së tij në vitin 1922, ai i kishte dhënë të gjitha larg për përmirësimin e klasës punëtore.<br/><br/>Megjithëse Leclaire nuk ishte vetëm eksperimenti social i Nelsonit, konsiderohet përpjekja e tij më e suksesshme. Përpjekje të tjera të mëdha për përmirësimin social përfshijnë një zinxhir dyqanesh ushqimore bashkëpunuese në New Orleans, një kopsht për fëmijët e punonjësve të zi në Bessemer-in e tij, Alabama, fabrika dhe një shtëpi për konsumatorët në Indi, Kaliforni.<br/><br/>Fshati Nelson i Leclaire ishte i njohur ndërkombëtarisht si një eksperiment i shquar dhe i suksesshëm. Ajo u përshkrua në Botën e Nju Jorkut në raste të shumta, por në veçanti nga gazetarja Nellie Byly në 1894 e cila shkroi gjatë për qytetin e modelit ku "Puna e punës zgjidhet dhe të gjithë të lumtur në një fshat të vogël pranë Shën Louis". Los Angeles Times gjithashtu raportonte rregullisht për N. O. Nelson, si dhe Chicago Daily Tribune dhe shumë publikime të tjera.<br/><br/>Në një fjalim të mbajtur në festën e 15-vjetorit të Leclaire në 1915, Nelsoni tha: "Leclaire shtrihet tek ju një mikpritje të gjerë dhe të hapur, duke ju ofruar juve sot lehtësinë dhe rehati dhe bukurinë dhe frymëzimin që ne gëzojmë çdo ditë." Më shumë se një shekull ka kaluar që nga ajo ditë, por ftesa ende qëndron.Banesat dhe studiuesit ftohen të mësojnë për historinë e Leclaire dhe marrin parasysh mësimet që mund të mësohen për përmirësimin e brezave të ardhshëm.<br/><br/>Një nga ish-ndërtesat e kompleksit prodhues në vitin 2019, i cili tani shërben si kampusi N.

| Author Visits via Zoom or Skype<br/><br/>I'm excited to visit with your students via Zoom or Skype! Skype is a great option for schools/classes who aren't bringing in in-person authors, but who want to explore books and poetry, connect with an author, and ask one-on-one questions.<br/><br/>Cost<br/><br/>I offer 30-45-minute Zoom or Skype visits with schools for $125 per session (or $200 for two sessions happening within three hours in the morning or the afternoon; $325 for three sessions in one day; $425 for four sessions in one day). In each session, I try to get kids as actively involved as possible. No, it's not the same kind of connection as an in-person visit offers, but it can still be inspiring and motivating for kids!<br/><br/>What I Do<br/><br/>Each session for up to 50 students includes:<br/><br/>5 minutes of tech set-up<br/><br/>3 segments of 10ish-minutes each — You choose from:<br/><br/>How I became a writer<br/><br/>Writing this particular book (you choose which book I focus on)<br/><br/>Reading (I read some poems and kids help me read others)<br/><br/>Classroom presentation (your students put on a reading or performance for me—a very appreciative audience!)<br/><br/>Writing a poem together<br/><br/>Question and answer session<br/><br/>5 minutes of wrap-ups/goodbyes<br/><br/>I also chat with classes of pre-service teachers or groups of in-service teachers about poetry and writing.<br/><br/>Tips for a Great Virtual Visit<br/><br/>Tips for a Successful Virtual Visit<br/><br/>One of my goals for virtual school visits is to capture the interactivity that makes in-person visits successful and fun. But the truth is that sometimes it's tough to be virtually interactive! The timing might not sync up correctly, which makes reading together a challenge, and it's really hard for me to hear individual students unless they come up and speak directly into the microphone/computer. But after some trial and error, I've discovered some ways to have the best virtual visits possible. Here they are: 10 ways to make my visit with your students a great experience!<br/><br/>Before the Visit<br/><br/>Get kids as excited as possible about the visit. Visit my website with them. Read some of my books with them. Gather some questions students have for me. Anything you do ahead of time to make it feel like a BIG DEAL will go a long way toward student engagement.<br/><br/>Position the video camera or laptop with webcam so that I can see as much of the audience as possible. It's hard to assess student engagement when I can only see a couple of students.<br/><br/>Limit each group to 50 students. It's incredibly hard to engage large groups via video.<br/><br/>I'll move quickly from topic to topic or poem to poem. Please remind students that they'll need to listen closely to understand what's going on.<br/><br/>Occasionally, I do a little Reader's Theater with students. If I send you any scripted student parts ahead of time, print a copy for EACH session and cut into pieces, if needed.<br/><br/>During the Visit<br/><br/>When I discuss a book, if you have that printed book, please hold it up for students to see.<br/><br/>You are my proxy. I often can't call on students and hear individual replies. So, I might say, "We're going to get 3 ideas. Raise your hand if you have an idea." Then YOU take over, call on three students, and announce those answers to everyone in the room and to me.<br/><br/>Choose confident, outgoing students for scripted student parts (if I send any ahead of time). During my in-person school visits, I try to draw out some of the less confident students, but I've found that this doesn't work as well during virtual visits because I can't hear them.<br/><br/>Have students with speaking parts sit up front. When it's time, have them stand up and remind them to speak loudly.<br/><br/>In virtual visits, behavior management falls solely on you. I often can't see exactly what's going on, so do please step in as needed. If there's a big disruption, just ask me to hold on for a moment so that I don't chatter on while nobody's paying attention:>)<br/><br/>Feel free to take pictures of me on-screen and share on social media–even though pictures of me often look ridiculous because I'm making funny faces or something while I read!<br/><br/>If you have any questions at all, please just ask, either before or during the visit!<br/><br/>Scheduling a Virtual Session<br/><br/>Are you interested in scheduling a virtual visit with me? Just email me to set up a date, and we'll go from there | Vizitat e autorit nëpërmjet Zoom ose Skype<br/><br/>Unë jam i ngazëllyer të vizitoj me nxënësit e tu nëpërmjet Zoom ose Skype-it! Skype është një mundësi e shkëlqyer për shkolla/klasa që nuk sjellin autorë brenda personit, por që duan të eksplorojnë libra dhe poezi, të lidhen me një autor dhe të bëjnë pyetje një-në-një.<br/><br/>Kostoja<br/><br/>Unë ofroj 30 45 minuta vizita në Zoom ose Skype me shkolla për 125 dollarë për seancë (ose 200 dollarë për dy seanca që ndodhin brenda tre orëve në mëngjes ose pasdite; 325 dollarë për tre seanca brenda një dite; 425 dollarë për katër seanca brenda një dite). Në çdo seancë, unë përpiqem t’i marr fëmijët sa më aktiv të jetë e mundur.Jo, nuk është e njëjta lloj lidhjeje si një vizitë në person që ofron, por ende mund të jetë frymëzuese dhe motivuese për fëmijët!<br/><br/>Çfarë bëj unë<br/><br/>Çdo sesion për deri në 50 studentë përfshin:<br/><br/>5 minuta konfigurimi i teknologjisë<br/><br/>3 segmente prej 10 minutash secila — Ju zgjidhni:<br/><br/>Si u bëra shkrimtare<br/><br/>Shkrimi i këtij libri të veçantë (ju zgjidhni cilin libër unë fokusoj)<br/><br/>Reading (Kam lexuar disa poezi dhe fëmijë të më ndihmojë të lexoj të tjerët)<br/><br/>Prezantim në klasë (studentët tuaj më lexojnë ose performojnë për mua – një audiencë shumë e vlerësuar!)<br/><br/>Shkrimi i një poeme së bashku<br/><br/>Sesioni i pyetjeve dhe përgjigjeve<br/><br/>5 minuta mbështjellës/goodbyes<br/><br/>Unë gjithashtu bisedoj me klasat e mësimdhënësve të para-shërbimit ose grupeve të mësimdhënësve të shërbimit në lidhje me poezinë dhe shkrimin.<br/><br/>Këshilla për një vizitë të shkëlqyer virtuale<br/><br/>Këshilla për një vizitë të suksesshme virtuale<br/><br/>Një nga qëllimet e mia për vizita në shkollë virtuale është të kapni interaktivitetin që e bën vizitat personale të suksesshme dhe argëtuese.Por e vërteta ndonjëherë është se është e vështirë të jesh praktikisht interaktiv! Koha mund të mos sinkronizohet në mënyrë korrekte, gjë që e bën leximin së bashku të një sfide, dhe është shumë e vështirë për mua të dëgjoj studentët individualë nëse nuk dalin dhe flasin direkt në mikrofon/kompjuter. Por pas disa provave dhe gabimeve, unë kam zbuluar disa mënyra për të pasur vizitat më të mira virtuale të mundshme.Këtu janë: 10 mënyra për ta bërë vizitën time me studentët tuaj një përvojë të madhe!<br/><br/>Para vizitës<br/><br/>Merrni fëmijët sa më të ngacmuar në lidhje me vizitën. Vizitoni faqen time me ta. Lexoni disa nga librat e mi me ta. Mblidhni disa pyetje studentët kanë për mua. Çdo gjë që ju bëni para kohe për ta bërë atë të ndjehen si një DEAL BIG do të shkojnë një rrugë të gjatë drejt angazhimit të studentëve.<br/><br/>Poziciononi kamerën e videos ose laptopin me kamera në internet në mënyrë që të shoh sa më shumë nga audienca që të jetë e mundur., Është e vështirë të vlerësoj angazhimin e studentëve kur mund të shoh vetëm disa studentë.<br/><br/>Kufizoni çdo grup në 50 studentë.Është tepër e vështirë të angazhoni grupe të mëdha përmes videos.<br/><br/>Unë do të lëvizin shpejt nga tema në temë ose poezi në poemë.Ju lutem kujtoj studentëve se ata do të duhet të dëgjojnë nga afër për të kuptuar se çfarë po ndodh.<br/><br/>Herë pas here, unë bëj një Teatër të Vogël Reader me studentë.Nëse ju dërgoj ndonjë pjesë të skriptuar të studentëve përpara kohës, printoni një kopje për sesion EACH dhe prerë në copa, nëse është e nevojshme.<br/><br/>Gjatë vizitës<br/><br/>Kur diskutoj për një libër, nëse e ke atë libër të shtypur, të lutemi ta mbash për të parë studentët.<br/><br/>Ju jeni ndërmjetësi im, unë shpesh nuk mund të telefononi mbi studentët dhe të dëgjojë përgjigje individuale., Kështu që, unë mund të them, "Ne jemi duke shkuar për të marrë 3 ide. Pastaj ju merrni përsipër, telefononi tre studentë dhe shpallni ato përgjigje për të gjithë në dhomë dhe për mua.<br/><br/>Zgjidhni studentët me vetëbesim, që dalin për pjesë studentore të shkruara (nëse dërgoj ndonjë herë përpara). Gjatë vizitave të mia në shkollë, përpiqem të nxjerr disa nga nxënësit më pak të sigurt, por kam gjetur se kjo nuk funksionon gjithashtu gjatë vizitave virtuale sepse nuk mund t'i dëgjoj ato.<br/><br/>Kur të jetë koha, ata ngrihen në këmbë dhe u kujtojnë atyre se do të flasin me zë të lartë.<br/><br/>Në vizitat virtuale, menaxhimi i sjelljes bie vetëm mbi ju.Unë shpesh nuk mund të shoh saktësisht se çfarë po ndodh, kështu që ju lutem ndërhyni sipas nevojës. Nëse ka një përçarje të madhe, thjesht më kërkoni të mbaj për një moment në mënyrë që të mos shqetësohem ndërsa askush nuk i kushton vëmendje:>)<br/><br/>Mos ngurroni të më fotografoni në ekran dhe të ndani në mediat sociale – edhe pse fotografitë e mia shpesh duken qesharake sepse unë jam duke bërë fytyra qesharake ose diçka kur kam lexuar!<br/><br/>Nëse keni ndonjë pyetje, ju lutem thjesht pyesni, ose para ose gjatë vizitës!<br/><br/>Planifikimi i një Seancë Virtuale<br/><br/>A jeni të interesuar në planifikimin e një vizitë virtuale me mua? Vetëm më dërgoni me email për të ngritur një datë, dhe ne do të shkojmë nga atje |
| News Archive<br/><br/>New book looks at ways in which to tackle HIV-challenges<br/><br/>2011-11-29<br/><br/>Prof. Dennis Francis with Marjorie Human who designed the cover of the book, Acting on HIV.<br/><br/>The HIV pandemic has brought out the best and worst in humans in terms of response. On the one hand it has prompted stigma and violence and on the other it has brought about constructive and supportive responses from various individuals and groups. A new book, Acting on HIV, edited by Prof. Dennis Francis, Dean of the Faculty of Education at the University of the Free State, looks at how drama can be used to promote vital social change as well as individual behavioural change.<br/><br/>Acting on HIV offers a systematic inquiry into drama as an approach to discuss HIV/AIDS and related attitudes and behaviours. The book is a scholarly text and includes the work of some twenty exceptionally creative authors. Contributing authors to the book include, amongst others, Proff. Hazel Barnes (University of the Witwatersrand), Rob Pattman (Stellenbosch University) and Yvonne Sliep from the University of KwaZulu-Natal.<br/><br/>"This project started in 2009 and has taken much of my time to bring together the work of exceptionally creative authors. The research that is communicated through the book is original and timely and makes a significant contribution to conversations about the role/s and significance of drama in addressing issues of HIV & AIDS," says Prof. Francis | Lajme Arkivi<br/><br/>Libri i ri shqyrton mënyra për të trajtuar sfidat e HIV-it.<br/><br/>2011-11-29<br/><br/>Prof. Dennis Francis me Marjorie Human që projektoi kopertinën e librit, duke vepruar në HIV.<br/><br/>Pandemia e HIV-it ka nxjerrë njerëzit më të mirë dhe më të këqij për sa i përket përgjigjes dhe nga njëra anë ka nxitur stigmën dhe dhunën dhe nga ana tjetër ka sjellë përgjigje konstruktive dhe mbështetëse nga individë dhe grupe të ndryshme. Libri i ri, Duke vepruar në HIV, i redaktuar nga Prof. Dennis Francis, Dekan i Fakultetit të Edukimit në Universitetin e Shtetit të Lirë, shqyrton se si drama mund të përdoret për të promovuar ndryshime jetësore sociale, si dhe ndryshime individuale të sjelljes.<br/><br/>Duke vepruar në HIV ofron një hetim sistematik për dramën si një qasje për të diskutuar HIV/AIDS dhe qëndrimet përkatëse. Libri është një tekst shkencor dhe përfshin punën e disa njëzet autorëve krijues. Autorët kontribues në libër përfshijnë, ndër të tjera, Prof. Hazel Barnes (Universiteti i Witwatersrand), Rob Pattman (Universiteti Stellenbosch) dhe Yvonne Slipe nga Universiteti i KwaZulu-Natal.<br/><br/>"Ky projekt ka filluar në vitin 2009 dhe ka marrë shumë nga koha ime për të mbledhur punën e autorëve jashtëzakonisht kreativë. Hulumtimi që komunikohet përmes librit është origjinal dhe në kohë jep një kontribut të rëndësishëm në bisedat për rolin/shenjen dhe rëndësinë e dramës në adresimin e çështjeve të HIV-it dhe SIDA-s”, thotë Prof. Francis |
| Transcript of Testing the Effect of Ghost Traps on the Blue Crab, Callinectis Sapidus , in Barnegat Bay<br/><br/>Michael FranklinMarine Field Methods16 September 2008<br/><br/>I chose to use the Blue crab, Callinectus sapidus, for my experiment because it is abundant here in Barnegat Bay and it is relatively easy to catch.<br/><br/>Callinectes sapidus is a swimming crab Important to commercial soft-shell crabbers, both commercial and recreational (Jivoff 2008)Main method of crabbing is basic crab trap<br/><br/>Ghost traps occur when a trap is lost yet continues to catch organisms (Breen 1990)John Wnek says there are easily 2,000 in Barnegat BaySince C. sapidus is so aggressive (Pollock 1998) , what happens when they get stuck in cage with no food and what impact does this have?<br/><br/>If caught in a ghost trap, C. sapidus will have cannibalistic tendencies until the last one has died off from starvation.<br/><br/>How do we duplicate a ghost trap in the lab?Create ghost trap by closing of entrances with wire mesh and zip tiesOnce specimen are loaded, close off top with zip ties<br/><br/>Crab entrance closed off with wire mesh<br/><br/>Crab TrapWire MeshWire CuttersRopeCameraZip Ties<br/><br/>How do we get crabs?Trap some a few days early and starve themOnce ready to begin, collect new crabs from trapsAdd directly to ghost trap with 2 from starved tank<br/><br/>Six crabs total, one missingFound small space to escape due; patched up with zip tieTwo crabs deadOne just has claws leftOther missing both paddles and one claw<br/><br/>Four crabs alive and intactLarger dead crab has no changeSmaller dead crab has only section of carapice left<br/><br/>Last day of experimentTook two samplesNo change from second day in first sampleSecond observation, larger carapice separated from rest of body/claw<br/><br/>Based on the results, I reject my null hypothesis that the crabs will simply be in the trap. The results show that they cannibalized two crabs in the trap, then, at least for the duration of my test, were satiated.<br/><br/>Ghost traps do affect the organisms stuck in them, namely C. sapidus.C. sapidus has no problem resorting to cannibalism when no other food source is available.Cannot extrapolate my data over whole bay. | Transkripta e Testimit të Efektit të Trapëve të Fantazmave në Gaforrja Blu, Callinectis Sapidus, në Gjirin Barnegat<br/><br/>Metodat e Fushës Michael FranklinMarine16 shtator 2008<br/><br/>Unë zgjodha për të përdorur gaforrën Blu, Kalinectus sapidus, për eksperimentin tim sepse ajo është e bollshme këtu në Barnegat Bay dhe është relativisht e lehtë për të kapur.<br/><br/>Callinectes sapidus është një gaforre noti e rëndësishme për gaforret komerciale butë-guaska, si komerciale ashtu edhe rekreative (Jivoff 2008) Metoda kryesore e fërkimit është gaforrja bazë<br/><br/>kurthe fantazmë ndodhin kur një kurth është e humbur ende vazhdon për të kapur organizmat (Breen 1990) John Wnek thotë se ka të lehtë 2,000 në Barnegat BaySince C. sapidus është kaq agresive (Pollock 1998), çfarë ndodh kur ata bllokohen në kafaz pa ushqim dhe çfarë ndikimi ka kjo?<br/><br/>Nëse kapen në një kurth fantazmë, C. sapidus do të ketë tendenca kanibaliste deri në vdekjen e fundit nga uria.<br/><br/>Si mund të dyfishojmë një kurth fantazmë në laborator?Krijoni kurth fantazmë duke mbyllur hyrjet me rrjetë teli dhe lidhje zip Pasi të ngarkohen mostra, mbylleni pjesën e sipërme me lidhje zip<br/><br/>Hyrja e gaforres e mbyllur me rrjetë teli<br/><br/>Gaforrja trapWire hapëse WireRopeCameraZip Ties<br/><br/>Si mund të merrni gaforret?Trap disa disa ditë herët dhe i uritur themOne gati për të filluar, të mbledhë gaforret të reja nga kurthet Shto direkt në kurth fantazmë me 2 nga tankeve uritur<br/><br/>Gjashtë gaforrja totale, një hapësirë e vogël që mungonGjetur për t'u arratisur për shkak; e rregulluar me zip tieTwo gaforret vdekurNjë vetëm ka kthetrat lënëTë tjera të humbur dy paddles dhe një kthetër<br/><br/>Katër gaforret e gjalla dhe të paprekur gaforrja më e madhe e vdekur nuk ka asnjë ndryshim gaforrja më e vogël e vdekur ka vetëm pjesë të karakinës së majtë<br/><br/>Dita e fundit e eksperimentitTook dy mostraNuk ndryshojnë nga dita e dytë në mostrën e parëVezhgimi i dytë, karakëri më e madhe e ndarë nga pjesa tjetër e trupit/kthesës<br/><br/>Bazuar në rezultatet, unë hedh poshtë hipotezën time të hundës se gaforret thjesht do të jenë në grackë.Rezultatet tregojnë se ata kanibalizuar dy gaforret në kurth, pastaj, të paktën për kohëzgjatjen e testit tim, u ngopën.<br/><br/>kurthet fantazmë ndikojnë në organizmat e mbërthyer në to, përkatësisht C. sapidus C. sapidus sapidus nuk ka problem të përdorë kanibalizëm kur asnjë burim tjetër ushqimi nuk mund të ekstrapolojë të dhënat e mia mbi gjithë gjirin. |

Since Lara Croft's first videogame appearance in Tomb Raider (1996), her exploits as an adventurous and quick-witted explorer have resonated widely with players, earning her a place in the pantheon of great pop culture characters. For that reason we will be putting The World of Lara Croft in the Storyworld Spotlight from December 22, 2021 to March 6, 2022.<br/><br/>Crafting a Croft<br/><br/>Lara Croft was created by studio Core Design, in Derby (UK), in 1996. The studio was looking for a lead character for their upcoming a 3D adventure game for PlayStation 1. A game in a 3rd person perspective where players would see the main character in full throughout every scene.<br/><br/>As the game was about 'raiding mysterious tombs deep under pyramids,' the lead character would need to look adventurous, and have the brains to survive complex raiding missions. After some deliberation, Lara Croft was born, a young, upper-class and utterly British woman, who was as enigmatic and intelligent as she was tough and self-reliant.<br/><br/>Success and controversy<br/><br/>Tomb Raider (1996) was a breakaway success for Core Design, who quickly doubled down on building Tomb Raider 2 (1997) and 3 (1998). A big part of the success was attributed to the games' leading lady, who found admirers both with male and female players. This baffled critics who just saw Lara Croft as a sexist cartoon.<br/><br/>Explore The World of Lara Croft in Storyworld<br/><br/>This exhibition explores the successful franchise in-depth. It looks at the history of the games and why its leading lady resonates with so many people. It also dives into the mystery of what makes Tomb Raider games tick, from the deep world building to the clever puzzles and traps, and from fantastic enemy and monster designs to the character design of the legendary heroine.<br/><br/>After all, mysteries are there to explore, and have been for the past 25 years.<br/><br/>Tickets<br/><br/>Buy your tickets for Storyworld online with a start date and entry time from Wednesday December 22.

| Real Estate Word of the Day: Option<br/><br/>Option: An agreement to keep open, for a set period, an offer to sell or lease real property. An option can be used, for example, to give the buyer time to resolve questions of financing, title, zoning and feasibility before committing the buyer to purchase. Options are frequently used in the land assemblage process. The option must be supported by its actual consideration, separate and independent of the purchase price of the property. Mere recital of consideration alone is not sufficient except in a lease-option in which the provisions of the lease are themselves sufficient consideration to support the option. An option merely creates a contractual right; it does not give the optionee any estate in the property. At the time the option is signed, the owner does not sell, nor does the buyer purchase, the property. Although the owner is obligated to sell if given notice by the buyer, the buyer is not obligated to purchase. An option to buy is also known as a call; an option to sell is known as a put. | Fjala e Pasurive të Paluajtshme të Ditës: Mundësi<br/><br/>Mundësi: Një marrëveshje për të mbajtur të hapur, për një periudhë të caktuar, një ofertë për të shitur ose marrë me qira pronën reale. Mund të përdoret një opsion, për shembull, për t'i dhënë kohë blerësit për të zgjidhur pyetjet e financimit, titullit, zonimit dhe fizibilitetit përpara se të angazhoheni me blerësin për të blerë. Opsioni duhet të mbështetet me anë të shqyrtimit të tij aktual, të veçantë dhe të pavarur nga çmimi i blerjes së pronës. Vetëm recital i shqyrtimit nuk është i mjaftueshëm, përveç në një opsion me qira në të cilin dispozitat e qirasë janë vetë të mjaftueshme për të mbështetur opsionin. Një opsion krijon thjesht një të drejtë kontraktuale; kjo nuk i jep mundësi çdo pasuri në pronë.Në kohën kur opsioni është nënshkruar, pronari nuk shet dhe as blerësi nuk e blen pronën. Edhe pse pronari është i detyruar të shesë në qoftë se i dhënë njoftim nga blerësi, blerësi nuk është i detyruar të blejë.Një opsion për të blerë është i njohur edhe si një telefonatë; një opsion për të shitur është i njohur si një e vënë. |
| Benefits of Carotenoids for the Skin<br/><br/>Have you heard of carotenoids? These powerful phytochemicals are the pigmented constituents found in plants that give flowers, fruits, and leaves their yellow, orange and red colours.<br/><br/>Since the 1930s, scientists have identified about 800 carotenoids and about 40 are found in the human body, including the outermost layer of the epidermis, the dermis and subcutaneous fat. The most common carotenoids are beta-carotene, alpha-carotene, lutein, zeaxanthin, lycopene, and astaxanthin. You can read more about astaxanthin here.<br/><br/>The content of carotenoids in the skin is influenced by numerous factors, including the intake of fruits and vegetables, their bioavailability from various foods, supplementation, exposure to UV radiation, air pollution, alcohol consumption, smoking and stress.<br/><br/>How do Carotenoids Help My Skin?<br/><br/>Carotenoids are some of the best-known antioxidants for the skin and they also have important functions as anti-inflammatory agents.<br/><br/>Healthy Aging and Skin Repair<br/><br/>Antioxidants are essential for healthy skin because they help to prevent free radical damage to cells. Free radical damage causes premature aging and the onset of various types of skin cancers. Carotenoids, along with vitamin E, vitamin C, and Co enzyme Q10 are important dermal antioxidants.<br/><br/>Due to their antioxidant activity, carotenoids support and encourage collagen and elastin production in the skin. This helps to increase the skin's density, thickness, elasticity, and firmness. Collagen and elastin decrease as we age, so getting enough carotenoids in the diet and topically is critical for aging well.<br/><br/>Carotenoids can improve the signs of photoaging, skin discolouration, elasticity, hydration, texture, and can reduce transepidermal water loss.<br/><br/>Astaxanthin in particular stimulates fibroblasts to produce collagen and elastin, inhibits the activity of the enzymes that breakdown collagen and elastin, and shows anti-inflammatory and UV-filtering effects. It has been shown to reduce melanin in the skin, which results in the decrease in the appearance of freckles and melasma.<br/><br/>Anti-acne activity: the anti-inflammatory activity of carotenoids helps to dampen the inflammation and irritation associated with acne. Carotenoids also help to normalize and balance oil secretions from the sebaceous glands. They are valuable agents in skin repair and they stimulate epidermal regeneration, helping to smooth and soften skin.<br/><br/>Where Can I Find Carotenoids?<br/><br/>There are two ways to get your daily dose of carotenoids: through diet and through topical application. The combination of both is the ideal approach to well-aging skincare.<br/><br/>Carotenoids are fat-soluble, so your body needs fat to absorb them (think tomatoes and olive oil, broccoli and butter, or spinach and avocado). Common sources of carotenoids in food are avocado, egg yolks, kale, spinach, carrots, sweet potatoes, papaya, and tomatoes.<br/><br/>While we advocate getting as many of your nutrients and antioxidants as you can from food rather than supplementation; one study showed that astaxanthin combined with collagen hydrolysate significantly improved barrier integrity, reduced transepidermal water loss, and increased the expression of procollagen type I mRNA.<br/><br/>Topical application is key to healthy skin. Studies show that high concentrations of antioxidants in human skin offer the best protection for healthy skin at any age.<br/><br/>At Sarka Botanicals, we blend carotenoid-rich, whole plants such as calendula, dandelion, and extracts like astaxanthin with cold-pressed oils and functional ingredients. Calendula alone contains over 19 different types of carotenoids. This may explain why it has such a long history of use in skin care. Studies show that carotenoids blended with co-enzyme Q10 are especially effective at reducing inflammation and slowing premature skin aging due to sun exposure. | Përfitimet e karotenoideve për lëkurën<br/><br/>Këto kimikate të fuqishme janë përbërjet e pigmentuara që gjenden në bimë që i japin lule, fruta dhe i lënë ngjyrat e tyre të verdha, portokalli dhe të kuqe.<br/><br/>Që nga vitet 1930, shkencëtarët kanë identifikuar rreth 800 karotenoide dhe rreth 40 gjenden në trupin e njeriut, duke përfshirë shtresën më të jashtme të epidermës, dermës dhe dhjamit nënlëkuror. Karotenoidet më të zakonshme janë beta-carotene, alfa-carotene, lutein, zeaxanthin, lycopene, dhe astaxanthin. Ju mund të lexoni më shumë në lidhje me astaxanthin këtu.<br/><br/>Përmbajtja e karotenoideve në lëkurë ndikohet nga faktorë të shumtë, duke përfshirë marrjen e frutave dhe perimeve, biodisponibilitetin e tyre nga ushqime të ndryshme, shtesa, ekspozimi ndaj rrezatimit UV, ndotja e ajrit, konsumimi i alkoolit, pirja e duhanit dhe stresi.<br/><br/>Si e ndihmojnë karotenoidët lëkurën time?<br/><br/>Karotenoidët janë disa nga antioksidantët më të njohur për lëkurën dhe ata gjithashtu kanë funksione të rëndësishme si agjentë anti-inflamatorë.<br/><br/>Plakja e shëndetshme dhe riparimi i lëkurës<br/><br/>Antioksiduesit janë thelbësorë për lëkurën e shëndetshme sepse ndihmojnë në parandalimin e dëmtimit radikal falas të qelizave.Dëmtimi i radikaleve të lira shkakton plakje të parakohshme dhe fillimin e llojeve të ndryshme të kancerit të lëkurës. Karotenoidët, së bashku me vitaminë E, vitaminë C dhe Ko enzimë Q10 janë antioksidantë të rëndësishëm Dermal.<br/><br/>Për shkak të aktivitetit të tyre antioksidues, karotenoidet mbështesin dhe nxisin prodhimin e kolagjenit dhe elastinës në lëkurë Kjo ndihmon në rritjen e dendësisë, trashësisë, elasticitetit dhe fortësisë së lëkurës. Kolagjeni dhe elastina zvogëlohen në moshën tonë, kështu që marrja e karotenoideve të mjaftueshme në dietë dhe në mënyrë tipike është kritike për plakjen e mirë.<br/><br/>Karotenoidet mund të përmirësojnë shenjat e fotoriprodhimit, çngjyrosjes së lëkurës, elasticitetit, hidratimit, strukturës dhe mund të zvogëlojnë humbjen transepidermale të ujit.<br/><br/>Astaksantina në veçanti stimulon fibroblastet për të prodhuar kolagjen dhe elastinë, pengon aktivitetin e enzimave që prishin kolagjenin dhe elastinën, dhe tregon efekte anti-inflamatore dhe ultravjollcë. Ajo është treguar se zvogëlon melanin në lëkurë, i cili rezulton në uljen në shfaqjen e njollave dhe melasmës.<br/><br/>Aktiviteti kundër akneve: aktiviteti anti-inflamator i karotenoideve ndihmon në zbutjen e inflamacionit dhe irritimit të lidhur me aknet.Karotenoidët gjithashtu ndihmojnë në normalizimin dhe balancimin e sekrecioneve të naftës nga gjëndrat sebaceous. Ato janë agjentë të vlefshëm në riparimin e lëkurës dhe stimulojnë rigjenerimin epidermal, duke ndihmuar në zbutjen dhe zbutjen e lëkurës.<br/><br/>Ku mund të gjej karotenoide?<br/><br/>Ekzistojnë dy mënyra për të marrë dozën tuaj të përditshme të karotenoideve: përmes dietës dhe përmes aplikimit lokal.Kombinimi i të dyjave është qasja ideale për kujdesin e mirë të lëkurës.<br/><br/>Karotenoidët janë të tretshëm në yndyrë, kështu që trupi juaj ka nevojë për yndyrë për të absorbuar ato (mendoni domate dhe vaj ulliri, brokoli dhe gjalpë, ose spinaq dhe avokado). Burimet e zakonshme të karotenoidëve në ushqim janë avokadot, të verdhët e vezëve, lakra, spinaqi, karotat, patatet e ëmbla, papaja dhe domatet.<br/><br/>Ndërsa ne avokojmë për të marrë sa më shumë nga lëndët ushqyese dhe antioksiduesit tuaj sesa për t’u plotësuar; një studim tregoi se astaksanti i kombinuar me integritetin e hidrogjenit të kolagjenit, zvogëlon humbjen transepidermale të ujit dhe rriti shprehjen e tipit të prolakenit I mRNA.<br/><br/>Studimet tregojnë se përqëndrimet e larta të antioksidantëve në lëkurën e njeriut ofrojnë mbrojtjen më të mirë të lëkurës së shëndetshme në çdo moshë.<br/><br/>Tek Sarka Botanica, ne perzihemi te pasur me karotenoid, te gjithe bimët si calendula, dandelion, dhe ekstrakte te tilla si astaksanti me vajra te presuara ne te ftohte dhe përbërës funksionalë.Kalendula përmban mbi 19 lloje te ndryshme karotenoidesh. Kjo mund të shpjegojë pse ka një histori kaq të gjatë përdorimi në kujdesin e lëkurës.Studimet tregojnë se karotenoidët e përzier me ko-enzimë Q10 janë veçanërisht të efektshëm në reduktimin e inflamacionit dhe ngadalësimin e plakjes së parakohshme të lëkurës për shkak të ekspozimit në diell. |
