| Bacopa<br/><br/>19 Nov 2015<br/>Posted by Doxiderol<br/><br/>Bacopa is a perennial plant that thrives in marshy subtropical and tropical regions around the globe. The highly regarded herb is a key ingredient in Doxiderol, a nutritional supplement that enhances cognitive function. Bacopa was chosen for its ability to protect the brain and increase acetylcholine, a biochemical messenger that enables the nervous system to relay information.<br/><br/>Ayurvedic practitioners first described the therapeutic properties of bacopa in 300 BC. The physicians recorded bacopa's abilities to enhance intelligence and memory. Nearly 2,500 years later, a growing body of modern research confirms the cognitive benefits of bacopa recorded in the Ayurvedic text.<br/><br/>In 1987, researchers in India evaluated the effects of bacopa on the intellectual function of school-aged children. During the four-week study, they administered bacopa to 40 children who were 6 to 8 years old. The scientists determined that bacopa increased perception and memory. The children were able to solve maze exercises quicker and more accurately after receiving bacopa. Many parents in India routinely use bacopa to enhance their children's intellectual development.<br/><br/>A 12-week study published in the August 2001 issue of Psychopharmacology investigated the effects of bacopa on cognitive function. Scientists randomly assigned the healthy volunteers, aged 18 to 65, to receive bacopa or an inactive substance. They also used a double-blind configuration for the study to conceal the identities of the products. Researchers use this design to ensure that the test results are valid because it eliminates bias by the researchers and participants. The bacopa group experienced a significant improvement in the speed at which they were able to process visual information. The participants also learned faster and stored new memories more efficiently.<br/><br/>In 2007, a Texas A&M College of Medicine laboratory study revealed one of the mechanisms responsible for bacopa's ability to promote brain health. According to the scientists, bacopa uses polyphenols to prevent oxidative stress and the damage that it causes to healthy brain cells. Bacopa also reduces harmful deposits of a substance known as beta-amyloid, which is the primary component of the plaque in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease.<br/><br/>A double-blind study published in the July 2008 issue of the Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine evaluated the effect of bacopa on elderly patients. The study confirmed that bacopa increased cognitive performance while reducing stress. According to the authors, the benefits achieved in this study confirmed the results of earlier research.<br/><br/>A 90-day study published in the December 2008 issue of Phytotherapy Research confirms the cognitive benefits that were previously demonstrated in other bacopa studies. Bacopa significantly improved the ability of the participants to temporarily store and use information required for completing a complex task. The double-blind study also demonstrated that bacopa reduced the time required to process visual information.<br/><br/>In addition to enhancing nerve signal transmission, the scientists theorize that bacopa increases cognitive function by reducing anxiety. Numerous studies indicate that anxiety interferes with the ability to perform tasks that require higher-level cognitive functions, such as learning and memorization. Stress disrupts biochemical messengers and healthy nerve signal transmission. Bacopa alleviates stress and restores a sense of calm by increasing acetylcholine levels, which reduces your heart rate and enables you to take deeper breaths.<br/><br/>Doxiderol is a great way to obtain the benefits of bacopa. This holistic supplement also contains other natural ingredients that promote brain health and support your ability to focus and concentrate on complex task as well as memorize information. | Bacopa<br/><br/>19 nëntor 2015<br/>Postuar nga Doxiderol<br/><br/>Bacopa është një bimë shumëvjeçare që lulëzon në zonat subtropikale dhe tropikale në të gjithë globin.Vetra shumë e konsideruar është një përbërës kyç në Doxiderol, një shtesë ushqyese që rrit funksionin kognitiv. Bacopa u zgjodh për aftësinë e saj për të mbrojtur trurin dhe për të rritur acetilkolinën, një lajmëtar biokimik që mundëson sistemin nervor për të transmetuar informacione.<br/><br/>Praktikuesit ajurvedik fillimisht përshkruanin vetitë terapeutike të bacopa në 300 p.e.s. Mjekët regjistruan aftësitë e bakopa-s për të rritur inteligjencën dhe kujtesën. Rreth 2.500 vjet më vonë, një trup në rritje i hulumtimit modern konfirmon përfitimet njohëse të Bakopës të regjistruara në tekstin Ayurvedic.<br/><br/>Në vitin 1987, studiuesit në Indi vlerësuan efektet e baccarat në funksionin intelektual të fëmijëve të moshës shkollore.Gjatë studimit katërjavor, ata administruan Bacopa për 40 fëmijë që ishin 6 deri në 8 vjeç. Shkencëtarët përcaktuan se Bacopa rriti perceptimin dhe kujtesën.Fëmijët ishin në gjendje të zgjidhnin ushtrimet e labirintit më shpejt dhe më saktë pas marrjes së Bacopa. Shumë prindër në Indi përdorin në mënyrë rutinore bacopa për të rritur zhvillimin intelektual të fëmijëve të tyre.<br/><br/>Një studim 12 javor i publikuar në çështjen e Psiopharmaology hetoi efektet e bacopa në funksionin kognitiv.Scientus rastësisht u dha vullnetarëve të shëndetshëm, të moshës 18 deri në 65 vjeç, për të marrë Bacopa ose një substancë joaktive. Ata gjithashtu përdorën një konfigurim të dyfishtë për studimin për të fshehur identitetet e produkteve.Studiuesit e përdorin këtë dizajn për të siguruar që rezultatet e testit të jenë të vlefshme sepse eliminon paragjykimet nga studiuesit dhe pjesëmarrësit. Grupi Bacopa përjetoi një përmirësim të ndjeshëm të shpejtësisë në të cilën ata ishin në gjendje të përpunojnë informacionin vizual.Të pranishmit mësuan gjithashtu më shpejt dhe ruanin kujtime në mënyrë më efikase.<br/><br/>Në vitin 2007, një studim laboratorik i Kolegjit A dhe M të Teksasit zbuloi një nga mekanizmat përgjegjës për aftësinë e Bakopa për të promovuar shëndetin e trurit. Sipas shkencëtarëve, Bacopa përdor polifenole për të parandaluar stresin oksidativ dhe dëmtimin që shkakton qelizat e shëndetshme të trurit. Bacopa gjithashtu zvogëlon depozitat e dëmshme të një substance të njohur si beta-amiloid, e cila është përbërësi kryesor i pllakës në trurin e pacientëve me sëmundje Alzheimer.<br/><br/>Një studim i dyfishtë i publikuar në numrin e Korrikut të vitit 2008 i Revistës mbi Mjekësinë Alternative dhe Plotësuese vlerësoi efektin e Bacopa mbi pacientët e moshuar.Studimi konfirmoi se Bacopa rriti performancën njohëse duke ulur stresin. Sipas autorëve, përfitimet e arritura në këtë studim konfirmuan rezultatet e hulumtimeve të mëparshme.<br/><br/>Një studim 90-ditor i publikuar në botimin e Dhjetorit 2008 të Hulumtimit të Fitoterapisë konfirmon përfitimet njohëse që janë demonstruar më parë në studimet e tjera bacopa. Bacopa përmirësoi ndjeshëm aftësinë e pjesëmarrësve për të ruajtur përkohësisht dhe për të përdorur informacionin e nevojshëm për kryerjen e një detyre komplekse.Studimi i dyfishtë tregoi gjithashtu se Bacopa reduktoi kohën e nevojshme për të përpunuar informacionin vizual.<br/><br/>Përveç rritjes së transmetimit të sinjalit nervor, shkencëtarët theksojnë se Bacopa rrit funksionin kognitiv duke reduktuar ankthin.

She can also sense demonic auras as well as evil auras. When she was born and growing, however, her powers were sealed and she was much less powerful. Since the defeat of the one sealing her powers, Kagome has reached her full potential.<br/><br/>PURIFICATION By making a physical connection, Kagome has the ability to purify both poison and darkness from a subject (living and inanimate). To do so, she projects her spiritual powers through her hand.<br/><br/>SPIRITUAL BARRIERS With her full potential, Kagome has the ability to create a barrier around herself and expand it around others. It is a dome-shaped barrier that can destroy weak demons that make contact with the barrier.<br/><br/>IMPROVED EYESIGHT<br/>Kagome has the ability to see things that are often invisible to the human eye: ghosts, spirits, divine and evil auras.<br/><br/>ABILITIES WITH WEAPONS<br/>Kagome has the ability to use a bow and arrow. She has been self trained, and after years of practice, her arrow rarely misses its mark. Alongside this, Kagome has the ability to infuse her arrows with powers. She can infuse an arrows with her spiritual powers which allows them to penetrate demonic forces, destroy spells, and purify objects. She can infuse her bow with her powers and deflect enemy attacks. She has the ability to infuse her arrows with purifying energy to purify poison as well as powerful, long distant demonic attacks. And, finally, she has the ability to bypass others with her arrow: If her target happens to be behind a barrier or a hostage, the arrow can teleport and hit only her target<br/><br/>The rest of her abilities have become rather unimportant as they are related to time travel (through the Bone Eater's Well), the Shikon Jewel, or her previous incarnation.<br/><br/>the canon<br/><br/>Kagome has been pulled a few days after her high school graduation, however, before the Bone Eater's Well has opened again to allow her to return to the past permanently.<br/><br/>freestyle<br/><br/>memories<br/><br/>かごめ<br/><br/>The sound of her name was a soft whisper in the back of her mind, like a call muffled by the wind. It was the sound of a distant memory, a voice that she had started to forget but desperately clung to all the same. It was her mother's voice, twisted in the sorrow of her lost daughter. Afterall, Kagome banished without a trace. She vividly remembered those moments, the way the day had begun, what she had for breakfast and the last thing she had said to her mother. It was haunting, those memories, because it was like any other time she had slipped between worlds. She had woken, listless, because she had no purpose outside of school. She could find a job, and was scheduled for an interview that day. Her heart hadn't been in it, but it was what she needed to do.<br/><br/>She remembered the feeling of dread, sucking it up and giving herself a pep talk that she could do this. That she could progress in the life that she was meant to now that things had been settled in the past. Of course, she had the lingering feeling that she no longer belonged in her own time or her own life. Not with everything that she had left behind.<br/><br/>Kagome remembered the feeling of the wood beneath her fingers, the way her hand had curled into the handle to slide the door open. She remembered that she paused, turning to her mother with a bright and vibrant smile as she shook herself from her stupor. "I'm taking off." She remembered how strong her voice sounded, the smile on her mother's lips as her eyes shone with pride. Her mother bade her farewell, which didn't seem any different than before but somehow the weight of the words settled in heavier on Kagome's shoulders the more she reflected.<br/><br/>Briefly, the thoughts flickered forward, wondering if her mother worried over her, missed her like she did. Kagome could openly admit that her mother's strength, her support for the fact that her daughter slipped through time so frequently. There were times when she thought herself weak for not having the woman to lean on.<br/><br/>However, she remembered that she did muster up a meager amount of strength.She could remember the shift in the air, the temperature notably different than what she had expected, blinking at the sudden and unfamiliar surroundings. It was not her family's shrine. And when she turned to go back, to slip through the door she had come through, she was met with unfamiliar and cold metal beneath her fingertips and an interior that was not the entrance of her house. A man stood before her, behind a counter, who stared at her with eyes as wide as her own.<br/><br/>She didn't panic, at least. Being torn through time and placed in impossible situations at least built your willpower as far as strange happenings went. Because it wasn't every day that someone found themselves dragged into the past by a demon, intent on ripping a powerful jewel from their body that they didn't even know was there. And then there was the fact that she had shattered said powerful jewel into who knows how many pieces and was tasked on finding them. Such things were not normal, and she had needed to square up and roll with it once she realized that was her reality. It had seemed so simple, just gather the shards and fix the jewel.<br/><br/>But it hadn't been easy, there were many demons after the shards and the jewel itself. And one particularly powerful demon with a wish that he was determined to see fulfilled. To this day, she had never learned his wish but knew it had never been granted even once he had the blasted thing completed. He had ruined so many lives for the sake of nothing. Ruined so many lives for such a futile task. Naraku had been the most difficult foe, and the one who had been the center of everything that had gone wrong in all of her friend's lives.<br/><br/>But, it was that unpredicability, that necessity to roll with what was happening and the willpower that she had gained from her adventure that she remembered drawing upon to come up with a story that fit in the moment that didn't seem too whimsical or far fetched. She needed to be believed, she needed to survive.<br/><br/>Afterall, she faced worse than a man in a camera store. She had lied through her teeth to save her life before.<br/><br/>"I was looking for a job." In the end, it wasn't a complete lie. After all, she had set out of her house with the intent of attending a job interview. Her state of dress would at least attest to that much. It was one of the easier fibs she had ever told.<br/><br/>And, for some reason, that crazy man hired her.<br/><br/>かごめ<br/><br/>Kagomed rolled over in her bed as she pushed back the distant memories, refusing to acknowledge that she was really awake. She clawed at the last glimpses of sleep, begging it to return and to take her back into its embrace. She closed her eyes, willing sleep to come and was only met with memories. The echoes of a song sang in the distance of her memories, a song that had often tormented her, given the same name as her. The voice that sang was no longer reminiscent of her mother, but the voices of children who she had often played with growing up. They called back the memories, even though it had been years since she started this live, even though she was happy in this life, the call of these memories was too loud.<br/><br/>Suddenly, she was falling back into them and sleep evaded her again. She was watching herself in her family's embrace while Inuyasha was pulled back into the well, looking as startled as she had felt. The memories of that moment, those feelings, were still so strong. The feeling of heartbreak and sorrow welled up again though it had been so long since she had felt like she had been ripped away from everything that mattered to her.<br/><br/>Of course her family mattered, and she was happy to be in their arms again. She could never fully, truly describe how she had felt in those days. She still couldn't explain the way she felt split in two, with warring desires to be in both her past and present. She remembered the futile attempts to jump through the well, fingers clawing at the ground in a desperate plea to let her return. The first month home, she didn't sleep so much as she cried.<br/><br/>Elysion had garnished a similar reaction, though it was not so fierce because she didn't know exactly where she had slipped through nor did she know where she could worm her way back. Her explorations were subtle between working her job and trying to settle herself into this life. She had no intentions of staying, no intentions of lingering longer than she needed. And while she didn't try as fiercely as she had when she tried to return to the past, her passion was tenfold because she had no ties to this world. Because she was truly alone… With no hope of anyone to reach her.<br/><br/>In her irrational moments, she thought the Jewel had pulled her back and found a new hell for her to reside in. A new hell that would force her to make a wish, but she remembered very clearly that she had wished it gone forever. That didn't stop her dreams, the times when she woke up in the night sobbing. And those memories of her past were the hardest to deal with, the hardest to forget. Her heart began to race in a panic as she turned in her bed again, her breath became a struggle as she fought against a panic attack induced by her wandering mind this late into the night.<br/><br/>She hated feeling so weak, so afraid.<br/><br/>籠の中の鳥は<br/><br/>Kagome finally pulled herself from bed, her room lit with a pale light that was enough to guide her to the bathroom. She stood before the mirror, the sink running while she stared at her reflection. Raven colored hair covered her face and she felt as bad as she looked. Her first morning in Elysion was similar to this, only she was in worse shape.<br/><br/>She had found a place to sleep, managing to work out a deal with the owner of the building to allow her to stay a small period of time without paying. Perhaps it had been Miroku's influence that allowed her to strike such deals, as the monk was known for his way in charming (or scamming) people into giving them more than enough for the work they had done. The monk had always been that way, since they had first met. He would claim the dwelling of a lord to be haunted when it was not or, claim that they were subject to an attack when they would not be. He would sell his wards and charms for such high prices. It worked practically every time and she wondered why people had been so willing to trust him.<br/><br/>Perhaps it was his smile, or the fact that he was a monk that the people of the past were so willing to crumble. He never preyed on the weak, at least. He always did what was right and he was a symbol of strength to her at times when he would push through everything in order to do what was right. He pushed through the fact that he was dying, that he was cursed, and tried to do something about it rather than wallowing in his fate. He had pushed himself to the limit in the time leading up to their final fight. And she had been glad that they had defeated Naraku before he could become subject to the same fate as his father, and his father before him.<br/><br/>As far as her own charms went, however, she was more fair than her friend and made the deal reasonable. She doubted that anyone in this world would pay a hefty price for an exorcism or banishing demons. They were too technologically advanced for that. But she was clever enough, and smart enough, to make a good deal.<br/><br/>But now, Kagome was in a better place though the look on her face looked the same. Haunted, tired, drained...<br/><br/>A quick glance at a clock on the wall told her that she could try to sleep longer. But she opted out of that, not wanting to face the flashbacks again. She took a shower instead, using the cold water to chase away her demons, to fill her lungs with a sharp intake of breath and force herself awake.<br/><br/>いついつ出やる<br/><br/>It didn't work.<br/><br/>Not in the way she was wanting. The cold water certainly forced the air into her lungs, forced her mind to wake and muscles to seize. A bitter laugh was pulled from her lips as she tilted her head back and found herself remembering more. Today, she wasn't going to escape them so easily. She wasn't going to recover so simply, to recover just because she willed it.<br/><br/>Sometimes, there's no avoiding the thoughts you wanted to. Even when you were certain that you were past them.<br/><br/>Sango would have been a great help in this situation. The demon slayer was her best friend, she would even go as far as to call her the sister that she never had. An older sister who was wise, always had her side when trouble arose. Particularly boy trouble, when such things were rather trivial but it was fun to have a crush and for her friend to be mad on her behalf when Inuyasha made her sad. After all, it had been often that the half-demon would run to his dead lover's side and break her heart more than once.<br/><br/>But, Sango also inspired her in other ways. After all the woman had faced, she had always been so strong, so sure... Even in the times that she had doubted herself, she always pulled through. She admired that she had the ability to survive after losing her whole family -- the reminder of this often pushed Kagome to survive, because she lost everyone to this world -- and then having her brother become a pawn of Naraku. It wasn't easy, couldn't have been something to that just anyone could face and still go forward with. She still smiled, even with that pain and those reminders... She was often so bright, even in the darker times.<br/><br/>And right now, she wanted to lean into the older woman's side, to take comfort in the fact that she was there and she was supportive. She felt that Sango would somehow pull through this, and offer some words of strength and understanding. It was times like these that made these spells worse, the constant reminder that she was without her family.<br/><br/>"I don't want to be alone." She cried aloud in her solitude, the sound of the shower drowning out the plea.<br/><br/>She wasn't afraid to admit it.<br/><br/>夜明けの晩に<br/><br/>Another hour had slipped by before she had realized it. Her skin was cold from the water and it felt like ice ran through her veins. She hadn't realized she had begun to shiver until her hand reached to turn off the water and end her shower. Kagome didn't seek her own gaze in the mirror again, instead, she wrapped herself in towels and trudged out of the bathroom, up the stairs and into her kitchen. She started on making a light breakfast, idly reading through her notes for the day as the food cooked.<br/><br/>Her career was really taking off these last years. Her photos were featured in many galleries, her name started to frequent many lips for those who were interested in photography.<br/><br/>The job she had asked for on a whim had sparked it all. She had been far more lucky than she had expected to be in this world. Never lucky enough to slip back through the cracks into her own world, but lucky enough to do well. As she turned back to the stove, she remembered the time she had finally given up on returning home. It was about two years into her life here, as she had started to venture into photography as more than just a hobby but something she could make a name for herself with.<br/><br/>That day had been particularly pleasant, the sun was high in the sky and she had found herself taking some photos of the natural scenery. A little boy had hidden in one of the plants, and she had caught a picture of the moment his face had settled into a cheerful, mischievous grin the moment before he had jumped out to startle his prey. It reminded her of Shippou, the little kitsune she had, essentially, adopted. He, too, had been torn from his family when they had first met. His father killed and he was determined to avenge him. While young, he did seem so mature in their first encounters.<br/><br/>Maybe it had been the influence of Inuyasha that allowed the kit to act like a kid again, to be young and whimsical at times while others he was more mature. He offered comfort to her in his own way, and she tried to care for him as she would her own though she had been so young then as well. However, her youth did not stop her from understanding how to tend to him or care for him like her child. Her heart swelled when he smiled, when he had been so happy for his gift of crayons and took the time to make art. She was so proud of each drawing that he had finished that she knew that this was how a mother would feel in such a situation.<br/><br/>The pain that had ripped through her was too much, too sudden. She missed him and wanted to see how much he had grown since she had been gone. She had missed so much...<br/><br/>To spare herself any further pain, any false hopes… She gave up. And focused on bettering herself.<br/><br/>鶴と亀が<br/><br/>Breakfast tasted bland, boring, and inspired. Only after she had finished did she realized she had forgotten to any sort of spices or flavor to the food. It was too late now to remember that much, as her mind was too busy remembering other details of her life that clearly had become more important than her food.<br/><br/>"Sit!"<br/><br/>Of course, nothing happened when she had angrily yelled at one particularly frustrating client that reminded her of the half-demon. He was being particularly stubborn and rude, wanting a photo taken his way rather than letting it work out naturally. You could try to force wild animals to behave how you wanted. But, rarely did anyone succeed with force. Inuyasha wasn't as bad, however. Inuyasha had learned before she had been forced away from him. He had become gentler, more understanding, more mature though there were times he was still childish and cocky.<br/><br/>She remember how red her cheeks had burned, but how she stood her ground and fired him. She told him she refused to work for anyone or with anyone who wanted to twist something beyond it's nature, beyond it's own desires.<br/><br/>She should have compared the man to Naraku rather than Inuyasha. Though her client did not have such extreme intentions. At least the feeling afterwards was a pleasant memory. The freedom of knowing that she had come so far that she could refuse work that she didn't want to do, to be her own person that was independent of others. She could say that she made it at that point. Even though she heard rumors days later with words meant to slander her.<br/><br/>She defended herself righteously, like she did towards the end of her journey. After all, she was the only one who could protect herself in this world.<br/><br/>滑った<br/><br/>Morning light began to creep into her home, reminding her again of the passage of time. Again, she considered the list of things she had to do and debated on where to start. Or, if she should even start at all. With how the day began, she didn't know if she could consider that a great idea. It was doubtful that she would be successful with how lost in herself she was becoming.<br/><br/>She didn't want to mess up her latest work. Because she had done that on a few occasions before. It wasn't pleasant to try and recover from a complete disaster.<br/><br/>Kagome remembered the feeling of her expensive, brand new, camera slipping from her hands. She wasn't prepared to support it, because she had just removed it from her bag. Part of her screamed on the inside. A dramatic, over-the-top, full on scream that she frequently did when she was much, much younger. When she was struggling to make it through middle school while hopping between times. The other part of her had remained frozen in place while her lense completely shattered and the rest of the camera had broken along with it.<br/><br/>Seeing Inuyasha's brother, a full demon, standing before her was the last thing she expected when she had made her way out for her photos. He stood as proud as ever, as tall as ever, as imposing as she remembered. He didn't look fazed at all to be in an entirely different world, though she was never the best at reading his mind. His name on her lips was so potent, that she could remember the tiniest feelings as she did. Her lips were chapped, her mouth felt dry, and the bubbling feeling of anxiety in her stomach made her feel sick.<br/><br/>She didn't want her hopes to be up.<br/><br/>But, she wanted him to be there, even if they were not friends. They were allies, if anything, since they had fought side by side. And something was better than absolutely nothing.<br/><br/>And Kagome had the sense enough not to throw herself at him, to wrap her arms around him in relief that knowing she was not alone. Her camera no longer mattered when she approached him. She remembered that nothing else mattered for days as she spent time with him, not speaking of their world but speaking (or, she was speaking and he simply acknowledged that fact).<br/><br/>When, exactly, she fell for him though… Kagome couldn't recall. It was a subtle thing, just like he was. But she knew the feeling was there. And he let her know that she was not alone in the fact that she had fallen, that feelings had somehow blossomed.<br/><br/>後ろの正面<br/><br/>A feeling of weightlessness overtook her and suddenly her eyes opened while her mind desperately clawed for the last thing she was doing. She didn't recall when she had fallen asleep on her couch, but she knew the last place she had been was on the far too comfortable cushions. She didn't struggle, however, or fight the weightlessness as she was in familiar arms. Her head tilted against Sesshoumaru's chest, taking comfort in the fact that he was here and she wasn't alone.<br/><br/>"Welcome back." His response was a soft hum in acknowledgement. He didn't need to speak much for her to understand his intent, or the rest of what he had to say.<br/><br/>He carried her back to her bed, settled her into it with ease. Her eyes met his and she smiled easily because no more memories drifted back, no more recollections teased at her. No, whenever he was near, she never fell back into those thoughts. He had helped, and the years had helped. Today was just… One of those days.<br/><br/>"Sleep." He commanded with ease, her eyes rolled at him but she did not fight because she was tired. Her hand clung tightly to him, while she felt his opposite hand press to her forehead in assessment of her wellbeing.<br/><br/>"I'm okay," she said, her words firm with her promise.<br/><br/>She was okay. She was alive. And she was happy.<br/><br/>だあれ<br/><br/>shipper<br/><br/>summary<br/><br/>Kagome, at one point in her life, was a rather regular teenage girl until she was attacked by a demon inside her family's well house. The demon dragged her down into the well, which magically transported her about 500 years into the past. There, she learned that a sacred jewel was encased inside her body as she was the reincarnation of a priestess that had died 50 years prior to the time she was dragged into. The jewel was ripped from her body and the demon that dragged her through time was defeated by the half-demon that she freed who was pinned to the tree. Kagome befriended the half-demon, Inuyasha, in time and traveled with him to restore the jewel that she, herself, shattered. Though it was not so straightforward and easy to do as many demons and humans sought the jewel for their own purposes. She befriended a young kitsune demon, a monk, and a demon slayer who all traveled with her to restore the jewel.<br/><br/>Her group, however, was not the one to complete the jewel. Instead, an evil half-demon who manipulated the majority of the major events in most of her companion's lives. When he finally collected all the pieces of the jewel and made his wish on the tainted object, Kagome was drawn into the jewel itself with the intent of her making a selfish wish to keep her trapped inside forever, keeping the jewel alive. It was the stubbornness of Inuyasha that managed to save her from the darkness. In the end, she returned to her natural time, finished high school as was expect from a girl of her timeline. Though days later, Kagome ended up in Elysion. She has been in this world for five years, and has long since given up on returning home. She's settled happily into her new life.<br/><br/>platonic<br/><br/>It's rather easy for Kagome to make new friends, she hasn't changed much from her youth. She is a cheerful young woman who is empathetic and welcoming to most of all in her life. In her youth, she befriended demons when most would fear them. Even demons that used to eat humans, she has befriended and she changed their ways (she'd like to think). This being said, it's really easy to become her friend as long as someone is able to shown that they are willing to be redeemed, or show that they are not completely evil. She feels greatly for everyone she meets, so it's hard for her not to be drawn to others in a desire to be friends.<br/><br/>antagonistic<br/><br/>The only way to earn Kagome's wrath is to be so deplorable, so evil, and so far beyond redemption that she can't see any good in you. And she can see the good in pretty much everyone and everything. Honestly, with whom she has faced? A half-demon that pitted two lovers against each other, that cursed the entire male line of one of her friends, and then had her best friend's brother kill their family… Yeah, I don't see her hating anyone without them really, really working for it. Feel free to give it a shot, though.<br/><br/>romantic<br/><br/>When in love, Kagome is a strong support, always staying there even when things may be rough. However, Kagome is not looking for love, wasn't looking for love when she arrived so any past relationships don't exist. This isn't to say that someone hasn't fallen in love with her. She can definitely be the subject of someone's unrequited love, she'll probably be oblivious about it, though. Finally, Kagome is currently engaged to Sesshoumaru, surprisingly. I'm totally open to potential AU things, though. <3<br/><br/>fandom hell<br/><br/>age ancient<br/><br/>species space queen<br/><br/>occupation dying<br/><br/>prefers she/her<br/><br/>awards<br/><br/>pro<br/>she/her est 62woo i suck at plot replies. but ok anyway!!! neptune is very friendly and has that 'cool' persona, he's really fun to be around, and he's SUPER good to work with. like he's super patient and he'll do anything she asks of him--he's really easy to work with, definitely in comparison to other models. so i love the idea of them being all work oriented friends at first and then turning into something more. neptune definitely tries to surround himself with people, because he loves having friends, and kagome is pretty much his type too? like she's sweet and she's a strong woman, and he is actually better friends with women than he is with men, idk why, he just loves being surrounded by female friends who knows. i love my guys being super good friends and protecting their girl friends honestly. but oh M A N i love pseduo-family type relationships and neptune is an only child, so he hasn't had any like, familial relationships like that. so her looking out for him all big sister like would make him be like ????? cause he's confused but also he actually really likes that LOL! they're both good kids, i think they'd be really fun ^^<br/><br/>fandom fire emblem: fates<br/><br/>age ninteen<br/><br/>species Part human / part dragon<br/><br/>occupation representative guardian<br/><br/>prefers she/her<br/><br/>awards<br/><br/>yonder<br/>she/her aest 20 posts<br/><br/>I haven't seen Inuyasha at all but... from what I've read Kagome seems to be one of those people who might be able to help Corrin out with her emotional state. There's a lot weighing on her mind since she had to fight her birth family against her will and last time she saw them they all pretty much hated her. Frankly she hasn't worked through everything yet since she was essentially at the head of a full-scale war. I feel they could be friends as Corrin is quite open in her personality, extremely trusting as well. She's just... hiding and struggling through a lot.

I love your idea of Kagome taking a pic of Elsa! You know, she's also a singer/performer at a local theater so I can imagine Kagome going there to scope things out and then catching Elsa backstage or something--and then the friendship could blossom from there! I absolutely adore the idea of these two spending quality bff time together doing the small but fun things Elsa never experienced as a child.

Kur ajo lindi dhe rritej, megjithatë, fuqitë e saj u vulosën dhe ajo ishte shumë më pak e fuqishme.Që nga disfata e atij që vuloste fuqitë e saj, Kagome ka arritur potencialin e saj të plotë.<br/><br/>Duke bërë një lidhje fizike, Kagome ka aftësinë të pastrojë helmin dhe errësirën nga një subjekt (të gjallë dhe të pajetë).Për ta bërë këtë, ajo i projekton fuqitë e saj shpirtërore përmes dorës së saj.<br/><br/>Me potencialin e saj të plotë, Kagome ka aftësinë të krijojë një barrierë rreth vetes dhe ta zgjerojë atë rreth të tjerëve.Është një pengesë në formë kube që mund të shkatërrojë demonë të dobët që bëjnë kontakt me barrierën.<br/><br/>Pamje e përmirësuar e syve<br/>Kagome ka aftësinë të shohë gjëra që shpesh janë të padukshme për syrin e njeriut: fantazmat, shpirtrat, aureat hyjnore dhe të liga.<br/><br/>APLIKACIONE ME Armë<br/>Kagome ka aftesine per te perdorur nje hark dhe shigjetë.Ajo eshte trajnuar vete, dhe pas disa vitesh praktike, shija e saj rrallë humb marken e saj.

Ajo mund të përfshijë një shigjetë me fuqitë e saj shpirtërore që u lejon atyre të depërtojnë forcat demoniake, të shkatërrojnë magjitë dhe të pastrojnë objektet.Ajo mund të infuzionojë harkun e saj me fuqitë e saj dhe të largojë sulmet e armikut. Ajo ka aftësinë për të mbushur shigjetat e saj me energji pastruese për të pastruar helmin, si dhe sulmet e fuqishme dhe të largëta demoniake.

Ishte zëri i nënës, i shtrembëruar nga pikëllimi i vajzës së saj të humbur. Pas kësaj, Kagome u dëbua pa lënë gjurmë. Ajo i kujtoi gjallë ato momente, dita kishte filluar, çfarë kishte për mëngjes dhe gjëja e fundit që i kishte thënë nënës. Ishte për të gjuajtur, ato kujtime, sepse ishte si çdo herë tjetër që ajo kishte rrëshqitur mes botëve. Ajo kishte zgjuar, pa kuptim, sepse nuk kishte ndonjë qëllim jashtë shkollës, mund të gjente punë dhe ishte caktuar për një intervistë atë ditë. Zemra e saj nuk kishte qenë në të, por ajo ishte ajo që ajo duhej të bënte.<br/><br/>Ajo kujtoi ndjenjën e frikës, duke e thithur atë dhe duke i dhënë vetes një bisedë pep që ajo mund ta bënte këtë gjë. Që ajo mund të përparonte në jetën që ajo kishte për qëllim tani se gjërat ishin vendosur në të kaluarën. Sigurisht që ajo e ndjeu ndjesinë se nuk i takonte më në kohën e vet ose në jetën e vet, dhe jo me gjithçka që kishte lënë pas.<br/><br/>Kagome kujtoi ndjenjën e drurit poshtë gishtërinjve të saj, mënyrën se si dora e saj ishte anuar në dorezë për të rrëshqitur derën hapur.Ajo kujtoi se ajo pauzoi, duke e kthyer nënën me një buzëqeshje të ndritshme dhe të gjallë ndërsa u tund nga shthurja e saj. Ajo kujton se sa e fortë tingëllonte zëri i saj, buzëqeshjen në buzët e nënës së saj ashtu si sytë e saj shkëlqenin me krenari. Nëna e saj i dha lamtumirën e saj, e cila nuk dukej më ndryshe se më parë, por disi pesha e fjalëve u vendos më e rëndë në shpatullat e Kagome sa më shumë ajo reflektoi.<br/><br/>Shkurtimisht, mendimet ia përcillnin mendjen nëse nëna e saj shqetësohej për të, e humbiste ashtu siç bënte ajo. Kagome e pranonte hapur se forca e nënës së saj, mbështetja e saj për faktin se vajza e saj kishte rënë nëpër kohë kaq shpesh. Ka pasur raste kur e ka menduar veten të dobët sepse nuk e ka gruan për t’u mbështetur.<br/><br/>Megjithatë, ajo kujtoi se bënte një masë të vogël force. Ajo mund të kujtonte ndryshimin e ajrit, temperaturën veçanërisht të ndryshme nga ajo që kishte pritur, duke u lidhur në mjedisin e papritur dhe të panjohur. Nuk ishte tempulli i familjes së saj dhe kur u kthye të kthehej, të rrëshqasë nga dera nëpër të cilën kishte ardhur, ajo ishte takuar me metale të panjohura dhe të ftohta poshtë gishtërinjve të saj dhe një interier që nuk ishte hyrja e shtëpisë së saj. Një burrë qëndronte para saj, pas një banaku, i cili ia nguli sytë aq gjerë sa ajo e vet.<br/><br/>Ajo nuk panik, së paku, duke u shqyer nëpër kohë dhe të vendosur në situata të pamundura, të paktën, me sa u bënë punë të çuditshme. Sepse nuk ishte çdo ditë që dikush e gjeti veten të tërhequr në të kaluarën nga një demon, qëllim për të grabitur një xhevahir të fuqishëm nga trupi i tyre që as nuk e dinin se ishte aty. Dhe pastaj ishte fakti që ajo kishte shkatërruar xhevahirin e fuqishëm në të cilin e dinte se sa copë dhe ishte ngarkuar për gjetjen e tyre. Të tilla gjëra nuk ishin normale, dhe ajo kishte nevojë për të sheshuar dhe të rrokulliset me atë pasi ajo e kuptoi se ishte realiteti i saj. Ajo kishte dukej aq e thjeshtë, vetëm të mbledhur shards dhe për të rregulluar xhevahir.<br/><br/>Por nuk kishte qenë e lehtë, kishte shumë demonë sipas shards dhe xhevahirit. Dhe një demon veçanërisht i fuqishëm me një dëshirë që ai ishte i vendosur të shihte të përmbushura. Deri më sot, ajo kurrë nuk e kishte mësuar dëshirën e tij, por e dinte që nuk i ishte dhënë ndonjëherë edhe pasi kishte përfunduar gjëja e tharë.Ai kishte shkatërruar kaq shumë jetë për hir të asgjës. Naraku kishte qenë kundërshtari më i vështirë dhe ai që kishte qenë qendra e gjithçkaje që ishte gabuar në të gjitha jetët e shoqes së saj.<br/><br/>Por, ishte ajo paparashikueshmëri, se domosdoshmëria për t’u rrokullisur me atë që po ndodhte dhe me vullnetin që e kishte fituar nga aventura e saj që ajo kujtonte duke u ngritur për të dalë me një histori që në atë moment nuk dukej shumë e çuditshme apo e largët. Ajo duhej të besohej, ajo duhej të mbijetonte.<br/><br/>Pas kësaj, ajo u përball më keq se një burrë në një dyqan fotografik. Ajo kishte gënjyer dhëmbët e saj për të shpëtuar jetën e saj më parë.<br/><br/>Në fund, ajo kishte nisur nga shtëpia me qëllim që të merrte pjesë në një intervistë pune. Gjendja e saj e veshjes do të provonte së paku atë punë, dhe ishte një nga fijet më të lehta që i kishte thënë ndonjëherë.<br/><br/>Dhe, për ndonjë arsye, ai njeri i çmendur e punësoi atë.<br/><br/>かごめ<br/><br/>Kagomed u kthye në shtratin e saj ndërsa ajo shtyu të rikthente kujtimet e largëta, duke refuzuar të pranonte se ajo ishte me të vërtetë e zgjuar. Ajo u lut në paraqitjet e fundit të gjumit, duke e lutur atë të kthehej dhe ta merrte atë përsëri në përqafimin e saj. I mbylli sytë, i gatshëm gjumë të vinte dhe takohej vetëm me kujtime, jehonat e një kënge në largësinë e kujtimeve të saj, një këngë që e kishte munduar shpesh, duke pasur të njëjtin emër si ajo. Zëri që këndonte, nuk i kujtonte më nënën e saj, por zërat e fëmijëve që ajo shpesh kishte luajtur me rritjen e saj. Ata i thirrën kujtimet, edhe pse kishte vite që kur ajo nisi këtë jetë, edhe pse ishte e lumtur në këtë jetë, thirrja e këtyre kujtimeve ishte shumë e lartë.<br/><br/>Papritur, ajo po kthehej përsëri në ta dhe po flinte e shmangte përsëri. Ajo po e shikonte veten në përqafimin e familjes së saj, ndërsa Inujasha u tërhoq përsëri në pus, duke parë siç e ndjente ajo. Kujtimet e atij momenti, ato ndjenja, ishin akoma kaq të forta.Ndjenja e zemrës dhe trishtimi u mbushën përsëri edhe pse kishte kaluar kaq kohë që kur ajo ndjente se ishte grabitur nga gjithçka që kishte rëndësi për të.<br/><br/>Sigurisht që familja e saj kishte rëndësi, dhe ishte përsëri e lumtur që ishte në krahët e tyre. Ajo kurrë nuk mund të përshkruante plotësisht se si kishte ndjerë në ato ditë. Ajo ende nuk mund të shpjegonte mënyrën se si e ndjente veten të ndarë në dy pjesë, me dëshira ndërluftuese për të qenë në të kaluarën dhe të tashmen e saj. Ajo kujtonte përpjekjet e kota për të kërcyer nëpër pus, gishtat që përplaseshin në një lutje të dëshpëruar për të lënë kthimin e saj. Muaji i parë në shtëpi, ajo nuk flinte aq shumë sa qante.<br/><br/>Elysion e kishte krijuar një reagim të ngjashëm, megjithëse nuk ishte aq e egër sepse ajo nuk e dinte saktësisht se ku ajo kishte rrëshqitur dhe as nuk e dinte se ku mund të ngrohte rrugën e saj prapa. Eksplorimet e saj ishin delikate midis punës së saj dhe u munduan të vendosen në këtë jetë. Ajo nuk kishte ndërmend të qëndronte më gjatë se ajo. Dhe derisa ajo nuk u mundua aq fort sa kur u përpoq të kthehej në të kaluarën, pasioni i saj ishte dhjetëfish sepse nuk kishte lidhje me këtë botë, sepse ajo ishte me të vërtetë e vetme... pa shpresë për askënd që të arrinte tek ajo.<br/><br/>Në momentet e saj irracionale, ajo mendoi se hebreu e kishte tërhequr mbrapa dhe kishte gjetur një ferr të ri ku të banonte. Një ferr i ri që do ta detyronte të bënte një dëshirë, por ajo kujtoi shumë qartë se e kishte dëshiruar që ai të shkonte përgjithmonë. Kjo nuk i ndali ëndrrat, koha kur u zgjua natën dhe ato kujtime të së kaluarës së saj ishin më të vështira për t’u marrë, më të vështirat për t’u harruar. Zemra e saj filloi të garojë në një panik ndërsa ajo u kthye përsëri në shtratin e saj, fryma e saj u bë një betejë ndërsa luftonte kundër një sulmi panik të shkaktuar nga mendja e saj e rrufeshme natën.<br/><br/>Ajo urrente ndjenjën aq të dobët, aq frikë.<br/><br/>籠の中の鳥は<br/><br/>Kagome më në fund u tërhoq nga krevati, dhomën e saj të ndriçuar me një dritë të zbehtë që ishte e mjaftueshme për ta drejtuar në banjë.Ajo qëndronte para pasqyrës, lavamani që vraponte teksa shikonte në reflektimin e saj. Flokët me ngjyrë korbi mbuluan fytyrën e saj dhe ajo ndjeu aq keq sa dukej.Mëngjesi i saj i parë në Elysion ishte i ngjashëm me këtë, vetëm ajo ishte në formë më të keqe.<br/><br/>Ajo kishte gjetur një vend për të fjetur, duke arritur të punonte me pronarin e ndërtesës për ta lejuar atë të qëndronte një periudhë të vogël kohe pa paguar. Ndoshta kishte qenë ndikimi i Mirokut që i lejoi asaj të godiste marrëveshje të tilla, pasi murgu njihej për rrugën e tij në një popull simpatik (ose mashtrues) për t’i dhënë sa më shumë për punën që kishin bërë. Murgu kishte qenë gjithmonë në atë mënyrë, që kur të ishin takuar për herë të parë, ai do të pretendonte se banesa e një zotërie do të ishte e përhumbur kur nuk ishte ose, do të pohonte se ata ishin subjekt i një sulmi kur ata nuk do të ishin.Ai do t'i shiste repartet dhe hijeshitë e tij me çmime të tilla të larta. Praktikisht punonte çdo herë dhe ajo pyeste veten pse njerëzit kishin qenë aq të gatshëm t’i besonin atij.<br/><br/>Ndoshta ishte buzëqeshja e tij, ose fakti që ai ishte një murg që njerëzit e së kaluarës ishin aq të gatshëm të shembeshin, të paktën ai kurrë nuk ishte i dobët. Ai gjithmonë bëri atë që ishte e drejtë dhe ai ishte një simbol i fuqisë së saj në kohët kur ai do të shtyjë përmes çdo gjë në mënyrë që të bëjë atë që ishte e drejtë. Ai përmes faktit se ai ishte duke vdekur, se ai ishte mallkuar, dhe u përpoq për të bërë diçka në vend që të përpëlitej në fatin e tij, ai kishte shtyrë veten në kufirin në kohën që çoi deri në luftën e tyre përfundimtare. Dhe ajo kishte qenë e lumtur që kishin mundur Narakun para se t’i nënshtrohej të njëjtit fat si babai i tij dhe i ati para tij.<br/><br/>Sa i përket hijeshive të saj të shkuara, ajo ishte më e drejtë se miku i saj dhe e bëri marrëveshjen të arsyeshme. Ajo dyshoi se dikush në këtë botë do të paguante një çmim të madh për një ekzorcizëm ose dëbim të demonëve. Ata ishin shumë të avancuar teknologjikisht për këtë. Por ajo ishte mjaft e zgjuar, dhe mjaft e zgjuar, për të bërë një marrëveshje të mirë.<br/><br/>Por tani, Kagome ishte në një vend më të mirë, megjithëse pamja në fytyrën e saj dukej e njëjtë.I përhumbur, i lodhur, i drenazhuar...<br/><br/>Një shikim në një orë në mur i tha asaj se ajo mund të përpiqet të flejë më gjatë, por ajo zgjodhi nga kjo, duke mos dashur të përballet përsëri me flashbacks. Në vend të kësaj ajo mori një dush, duke përdorur ujë të ftohtë për të ndjekur demonët e saj, për të mbushur mushkëritë e saj me një marrje të mprehtë të frymëmarrjes dhe të detyrojë veten të zgjohet.<br/><br/>いついつ出やる<br/><br/>Nuk funksionoi.<br/><br/>Jo në mënyrën se si ajo donte, uji i ftohtë sigurisht e detyroi ajrin në mushkëritë e saj, ia detyroi mendjen të zgjohet dhe muskujt të kapej.Një e qeshur e hidhur u tërhoq nga buzët e saj ndërsa ajo anonte kokën prapa dhe e gjeti veten më shumë. Sot, ajo nuk do t’i shpëtonte aq lehtë. Ajo nuk do të shërohej aq thjesht, për t’u shëruar vetëm sepse e donte.<br/><br/>Ndonjëherë, nuk ka shmangie të mendimeve që keni dashur, edhe kur keni qenë të sigurt se i keni kaluar ato.<br/><br/>Sango do të kishte qenë një ndihmë e madhe në këtë situatë.Slayer demon ishte miku i saj më i mirë, ajo do të shkonte aq larg sa ta quante motrën se ajo kurrë nuk kishte.Një motër më e madhe që ishte e mençur, gjithmonë kishte anën e saj kur u ngrit fatkeqësia. Veçanërisht djali probleme, kur gjëra të tilla ishin mjaft të parëndësishme, por ishte kënaqësi të kishte një dëshirë dhe që miku i saj të bëhej në emër të saj kur Inuisha e bëri atë të trishtuar. Në fund të fundit, shpesh kishte qenë se gjysmë demoni do të kalonte në anën e të dashurit të tij të vdekur dhe do ta thyente zemrën e saj më shumë se një herë.<br/><br/>Por, edhe Sangoja e frymëzoi në mënyra të tjera.Pas gjithë asaj që u përball ajo, kishte qenë gjithnjë kaq e fortë, kaq e sigurt... Edhe në kohën kur e kish dyshuar veten, gjithmonë u tërhoq. Ajo admiroi se kishte aftësinë për të mbijetuar pasi humbi tërë familjen e saj -- rikujtimi i kësaj shpesh shtyu Kagome të mbijetonte, sepse ajo humbi të gjithë në këtë botë - dhe më pas duke u bërë peng i Narakut. Nuk ishte e lehtë, nuk mund të kishte qenë diçka për atë që dikush mund të përballej dhe të shkonte përpara. Ajo ende buzëqeshte, edhe me atë dhimbje dhe ato rikujtesë... Ajo ishte shpesh aq e ndritshme, madje edhe në kohë më të errëta.<br/><br/>Dhe tani, ajo donte të prekej në anën e gruas më të vjetër, të ngushëllohej në faktin se ishte aty dhe ishte mbështetëse.Ajo mendonte se Sango do të tërhiqej disi nga kjo dhe do të ofronte disa fjalë fuqie dhe mirëkuptimi. Ishin raste si këto që i rëndonin këto, rikujtesë e vazhdueshme se ajo ishte pa familjen e saj.<br/><br/>Ajo qante me zë të lartë në vetminë e saj, dhe tingëllon zhurma e dushit.<br/><br/>Ajo nuk kishte frikë ta pranonte atë.<br/><br/>夜明けの晩に<br/><br/>Një orë tjetër u rrëshqua përpara se ta kishte kuptuar, lëkura e saj ishte e ftohtë nga uji dhe dukej sikur kishte rënë në akull nëpër venat e saj. Ajo nuk e kishte kuptuar që ajo kishte filluar të dridhej derisa dora e saj të arrinte ta fikte ujin dhe t’i jepte fund dushit. Kagome nuk kërkoi shikimin e saj në pasqyrë përsëri, në vend të kësaj, ajo e mbështolli veten me peshqir dhe trugged nga banjo, deri shkallët dhe në kuzhinë e saj. Ajo filloi të bënte mëngjes të lehtë, duke lexuar me qetësi nëpër shënimet e saj për ditën kur ushqimi gatuhej.<br/><br/>Karriera e saj me të vërtetë po nxirrte këto vitet e fundit.Fotot e saja u shfaqën në shumë galeri, emri i saj filloi të frekuentonte shumë buzë për ata që ishin të interesuar në fotografi.<br/><br/>Puna që ajo kishte kërkuar në një tekë i kishte ngjallur të gjitha. Ajo kishte qenë shumë më me fat sesa kishte pritur që të ishte në këtë botë., Kurrë me fat sa për të rrëshqitur përsëri nëpër të çara në botën e saj, por me fat të mjaftueshme për të bërë mirë. Kur u kthye në sobë, ajo kujtoi kohën që kishte hequr dorë më në fund për t’u kthyer në shtëpi. Ishte rreth dy vjet në jetën e saj këtu, pasi kishte filluar të vente në fotografi si më shumë se vetëm një hobi, por diçka me të cilën mund të bënte emër.<br/><br/>Ajo ditë kishte qenë veçanërisht e këndshme, dielli ishte i lartë në qiell dhe ajo e kishte gjetur veten duke marrë disa foto të peizazhit natyror. Një djalë i vogël ishte fshehur në një nga bimët, dhe ajo kishte kapur një foto të momentit kur fytyra e tij ishte vendosur në një grin gëzuar, të djallëzuar në momentin para se ai të ishte hedhur jashtë për të filluar pre e tij. Ajo i kujtoi asaj të Shippout, të vegjëlit që kishte, në thelb, të birësuar, dhe ai, gjithashtu, ishte grisur nga familja kur ishin takuar për herë të parë, babai i tij ishte i vendosur ta hakmarrë atë. Ndërsa të rinj, ai duket aq i pjekur në takimet e tyre të para.<br/><br/>Ndoshta ajo kishte qenë ndikimi i Inuyasha që lejoi kit për të vepruar si një fëmijë përsëri, të jetë i ri dhe i çuditshëm në kohë, ndërsa të tjerët ai ishte më i pjekur. Ai i ofroi ngushëllim asaj në mënyrën e vet, dhe ajo u përpoq të kujdesej për të si ajo do të ishte e saj edhe pse ajo kishte qenë aq e re atëherë, megjithatë, të rinjtë e saj nuk e penguan atë nga të kuptuarit se si të priren të kujdeset për të si fëmija i saj. Zemra e saj u fry kur qeshi, kur ai kishte qenë shumë i lumtur për dhuratën e tij të kremrave dhe mori kohë për të bërë art. Ajo ishte shumë krenar për çdo vizatim që e dinte se kjo ishte mënyra se si një nënë do të ndihej në një situatë të tillë.<br/><br/>Dhimbja që ishte grabitur prej saj ishte shumë e madhe, tepër e papritur. Ajo e humbi dhe donte të shihte se sa ishte rritur që kur ishte zhdukur....<br/><br/>Për të kursyer veten në çdo dhimbje të mëtejshme, çdo shpresë e rreme... Ajo u dorëzua dhe u fokusua në përmirësimin e vetes.<br/><br/>鶴と亀が<br/><br/>Mëngjesi provoi një truall, të mërzitshëm dhe të frymëzuar, vetëm pasi mbaroi, ajo kuptoi se kishte harruar çdo lloj erëz ose shije për ushqimin. Ajo ishte shumë vonë tani për të kujtuar se shumë, pasi mendja e saj ishte shumë e zënë duke kujtuar detaje të tjera të jetës së saj që në mënyrë të qartë ishte bërë më e rëndësishme se ushqimin e saj.<br/><br/>"Ulu!"<br/><br/>Sigurisht, asgjë nuk ndodhi kur ajo u ulë me zemërim në një klient veçanërisht frustrues që e kujtoi atë për gjysëm demonin dhe ai ishte veçanërisht kokëfortë dhe i vrazhdë, duke dashur që një foto ta merrte rrugën në vend që ta linte të punonte natyrshëm. Ju mund të përpiqeni të detyroni kafshët e egra të silleni në mënyrën se si dëshironi, por rrallë dikush arriti me forcë.Inuyasha nuk ishte aq i keq, megjithatë.Inuyasha kishte mësuar para se ajo të ishte detyruar larg tij. Ai ishte bërë i butë, më shumë mirëkuptim, më i pjekur edhe pse kishte kohë që ai ishte ende fëminore dhe kryelartë.<br/><br/>Ajo kujton se sa të kuqe ishin djegur faqet e saj, por se si ajo u ndal në tokë dhe shkarkoi atë. Ajo i tha atij se ajo nuk pranoi të punonte për askënd ose me këdo që donte të shtrembëronte diçka përtej natyrës së saj, përtej dëshirave të veta.<br/><br/>Ajo duhet të krahasonte njeriun me Narakun në vend të Inuyashas, por klienti i saj nuk kishte qëllime të tilla ekstreme.Të paktën ndjenja më pas ishte një kujtim i këndshëm. Liria për të ditur se kishte ardhur deri tani që ajo mund të refuzonte punën që nuk donte ta bënte, për të qenë personi i saj që ishte i pavarur nga të tjerët, dhe mund të thoshte se ajo e bëri atë në atë pikë. Edhe pse ajo dëgjoi fjalë më vonë, fjalë të tjera shkuan ta shpifin.<br/><br/>Ajo mbrojti veten me drejtësi, si ajo bëri në fund të udhëtimit të saj.Në fund të fundit, ajo ishte e vetmja që mund ta mbronte veten në këtë botë.<br/><br/>滑った<br/><br/>Drita e mëngjesit filloi të futet në shtëpinë e saj, duke i kujtuar përsëri kalimin e kohës, ajo përsëri e konsideroi listën e gjërave që duhej të bënte dhe debatonte se ku të fillonte, ose, nëse edhe do të duhej të fillonte fare. Me fillimin e ditës, ajo nuk e dinte nëse mund ta konsideronte një ide të madhe, sepse ishte e dyshimtë se do të ishte e suksesshme se si e humbi veten.<br/><br/>Ajo nuk donte të ngatërronte punën e saj të fundit, sepse atë e kishte bërë në disa raste më parë.Nuk ishte e këndshme të provohej dhe të shërohej nga një fatkeqësi e plotë.<br/><br/>Kagome kujtoi ndjenjën e të shtrenjtës, krejt të resë, të kamerës që rrëshket nga duart e saj.Ajo nuk ishte e përgatitur ta mbështeste atë, sepse ajo sapo e kishte hequr nga çanta e saj. Një pjesë e saj bërtiste nga brenda. Një pamje dramatike e sipër, plot me ulërima që bënte shpesh kur ishte shumë, shumë më e re.Kur po përpiqej ta bënte atë shkollë të mesme, duke shpresuar në mes kohëve. Pjesa tjetër e saj kishte mbetur e ngrirë në vend ndërsa lentja e saj ishte shkatërruar plotësisht dhe pjesa tjetër e kamerës ishte prishur së bashku me të.<br/><br/>Duke parë se vëllai i Inujashës, një demon i plotë, që qëndronte para saj ishte gjëja e fundit që priste kur ajo kishte bërë rrugën për fotografi të saj. Ai qëndroi po aq krenar sa ndonjëherë, sa ishte imponuar ashtu siç e kujtonte ajo. Ai nuk dukej aspak i fiksuar për të qenë në një botë krejtësisht tjetër, megjithëse kurrë nuk ishte më e mira për të lexuar mendjen e tij. Emri i tij në buzët e saj ishte aq i fuqishëm, saqë ajo mund të kujtonte ndjenjat më të vogla siç bënte ajo. Buzët e saj ishin të prera, goja e saj ndihej e thatë dhe ndjenja e flluskshme e ankthit në stomakun e saj e bënte të ndjehej e sëmurë.<br/><br/>Ajo nuk donte që shpresat e saj të ngriheshin.<br/><br/>Por, ajo donte që ai të ishte atje, edhe nëse ata nuk ishin miq, ata ishin aleatë, në qoftë se ndonjë gjë, pasi ata kishin luftuar krah për krah, dhe diçka ishte më e mirë se absolutisht asgjë.<br/><br/>Kagome kishte sensin e duhur që të mos hidhej tek ai, të mbështillte krahët rreth tij në reliev që e dinte se nuk ishte vetëm.Kamera e saj nuk kishte më rëndësi kur ajo iu afrua. Ajo kujtoi se asgjë tjetër nuk kishte rëndësi për ditët kur ajo kalonte kohë me të, duke mos folur për botën e tyre, por duke folur (ose, ajo ishte duke folur dhe ai e pranoi thjesht atë fakt).<br/><br/>Kur, saktësisht, ajo ra për të... Kagome nuk mund të kujtonte. Ishte një gjë delikate, ashtu si ishte. Por e dinte që ndjenja ishte aty. Dhe ai e dinte se ajo nuk ishte vetëm në faktin se ajo kishte rënë, se ndjenjat kishin lulëzuar disi.<br/><br/>後ろの正面<br/><br/>Një ndjenjë pa peshë e arriti dhe papritmas sytë e saj u hapën ndërsa mendja e saj u ankua dëshpërimisht për gjënë e fundit që po bënte. Ajo nuk kujtoi se kur kishte rënë në gjumë në divanin e saj, por e dinte se vendi i fundit ishte në jastëkët shumë të rehatshëm, por nuk e kishte luftuar, ose e kishte luftuar pa peshë teksa ishte në duar të njohura. Koka e saj e anuar kundër gjoksit të Sesshoumaru, duke marrë ngushëllim në faktin se ai ishte këtu dhe ajo nuk ishte vetëm.<br/><br/>Përgjigja e tij ishte një rrëqethje e butë, pa pasur nevojë të fliste shumë për të, për të kuptuar qëllimin e tij, apo pjesën tjetër të asaj që duhej të thoshte.<br/><br/>Ai e ktheu në shtratin e saj, e futi në qetësi. Sytë e saj e takuan dhe ajo buzëqeshi lehtë për shkak se nuk tërhiqej më nga kujtimet, nuk i ngacmohej më nga ajo.Jo, sa herë që ishte afër, ajo kurrë nuk u kthye në ato mendime. Ai kishte ndihmuar, dhe vitet kishin ndihmuar... Sot ishte vetëm një nga ato ditë.<br/><br/>Ai urdhëroi me lehtësi sytë e saj të mbështjellë, por ajo nuk luftoi sepse ishte e lodhur. Dora e saj kërceu fort tek ai, ndërsa ajo ndjeu shtypjen e tij të kundërt me dorën e saj në vlerësim të mirëqenies së saj.<br/><br/>Unë jam në rregull," tha ajo, fjalët e saj konfirmojnë me premtimin e saj.<br/><br/>Ajo ishte në rregull dhe ishte e gjallë; dhe ishte e lumtur.<br/><br/>だあれ<br/><br/>transportues<br/><br/>përmbledhje<br/><br/>Kagome, në një moment në jetën e saj, ishte një vajzë adoleshente mjaft e rregullt derisa u sulmua nga një demon brenda shtëpisë së mirë të familjes së saj. Demon e tërhoqi atë në pus, e cila e transportoi atë me magji rreth 500 vjet në të kaluarën. Atje ajo mësoi se një xhevahir i shenjtë ishte i mbështjellë brenda trupit të saj pasi ishte rimishërimi i një prifti që kishte vdekur 50 vjet para kohës në të cilën ajo ishte zvarritur. Xhevahiri u shqye nga trupi i saj dhe demoni që e zvarriti atë nëpër kohë u mundua nga gjysëm demoni që ajo e çliroi se ishte i shtypur në pemë. Kagome miqësoi gjysmë demoni, Inuyasha, me kohë dhe udhëtoi me të për të rivendosur xhevahirin që ajo, vetë, e shkatërruar.Megjithëse nuk ishte aq e drejtpërdrejtë dhe e lehtë për të bërë sa shumë demonë dhe njerëz kërkonin xhevahir për qëllimet e tyre. Ajo u miqësua me një demon të ri të kuzhinës, një murg dhe një vrasës demon që të gjithë udhëtuan me të për të rivendosur xhevahirin.<br/><br/>Megjithatë, grupi i saj nuk ishte ai që e përfundoi stolin. Në vend të kësaj, një gjysmë demon i lig që manipuloi pjesën më të madhe të ngjarjeve në shumicën e jetës së shokut të saj. Kur më në fund ai mblodhi të gjitha pjesët e xhevahirit dhe bëri dëshirën e tij për objektin e njollosur, Kagome u fut në xhevahir me qëllimin për të bërë një dëshirë egoiste për të mbajtur të bllokuar brenda përgjithmonë, duke e mbajtur stolin gjallë. Ishte kokëfortësia e Inujashës e cila arriti ta shpëtojë nga errësira.Në fund, ajo u kthye në kohën e saj të natyrshme, përfundoi shkollën e mesme siç pritej nga një vajzë e kohës së saj.Edhe pse ditët më vonë, Kagome përfundoi në Elysion. Ajo ka qenë në këtë botë për pesë vjet, dhe ka kohë që është hequr dorë për t’u kthyer në shtëpi.Ajo është vendosur e lumtur në jetën e saj të re.<br/><br/>platonike<br/><br/>Është më se e lehtë për Kagome të bëjë miq të rinj, ajo nuk ka ndryshuar shumë nga rinia e saj. Ajo është një grua e re e gëzuar që është empatike dhe mikpritëse ndaj shumicës së të gjithave në jetën e saj. Edhe demonët që dikur ushqeheshin njerëzit, ajo është miqësuar dhe ka ndryshuar mënyrat e tyre (do të donte të mendonte). Kjo që thuhet, është vërtet e lehtë të bëhesh mik i saj për sa kohë që dikush është në gjendje të tregojë se ata janë të gatshëm të shpengohen, ose të tregojnë se ata nuk janë plotësisht të këqij. Ajo ndihet shumë mirë për të gjithë që takohet, kështu që është e vështirë që ajo të mos merret me të tjerët në një dëshirë për të qenë miq.<br/><br/>antagonist<br/><br/>Mënyra e vetme për të fituar zemërimin e Kagome është të jetë kaq e mjerueshme, kaq e keqe, dhe kaq përtej shpengimit që ajo nuk mund të shohë asnjë të mirë në ju. Dhe ajo mund të shohë të mirën në të gjithë e gjithçka me mendjelehtësi, me të cilin është përballur? Një gjysmë-demon që ngriti dy dashnorë kundër njëri-tjetrit, që shau të gjithë linjën mashkullore të njërit prej miqve të saj, dhe pastaj e kishte vëllanë e mikut të saj më të mirë të saj të vrasë familjen e tyre... Po, unë nuk shoh të urrej askënd pa ta në të vërtetë, duke punuar me të vërtetë për të. Ndjehen të lirë për të dhënë atë një e shtënë, megjithatë.<br/><br/>romantike<br/><br/>Kur është në dashuri, Kagome është një mbështetje e fortë, gjithmonë duke qëndruar aty edhe kur gjërat mund të jenë të ashpra., Megjithatë, Kagome nuk po kërkon dashuri, nuk po kërkon dashuri kur mbërriti kështu që çdo marrëdhënie e kaluar nuk ekziston. Kjo nuk do të thotë që dikush nuk ka rënë në dashuri me të.Ajo patjetër mund të jetë subjekt i dashurisë së pashtershme të dikujt, me siguri do të jetë e qartë për të, megjithëse më në fund, Kagome aktualisht është e angazhuar me Seshoumaru, çuditërisht.

| Why You Should be on Twitter<br/><br/>Disclaimer: I am not, nor have I ever claimed to be, a social media guru. I'm just a person who thinks about stuff a lot, and this has come up a number of times.<br/><br/>I'm not an early adopter. Sometimes it takes me years to figure out what I want to use something for before I actually get on it, and Twitter was one of those things. I've been on Twitter seriously since about February of this year, so I'm pretty new at it. Still, I've learned a number of things, and I wanted to share them. Some people say I'm a Twitter pusher, and I am, because there's lots of good reasons to get on it, and virtually no downsides.<br/><br/>So what's Twitter? If you're on the internet, you've probably at least heard of it. It's a social media network that serves as a forum for conversations, updates, and news in a medium more public than something like Facebook or LinkedIn. Facebook is about who wants to find you, but Twitter is about who you want to find. Your favourite writers, actors, politicians, singers, and scientists are probably on Twitter. So are your favourite charities, radio stations, news sites, and stores. And they want you to find them and listen to what they have to say. Everyone on Twitter, at least initially, wants to talk with you.<br/><br/>But why join that? Why be a part of it? There's all kinds of reasons, and I'm going to give you a few.<br/><br/>People and Places Twitter is a great way to find out about events which are going on around the world, but also in your community. If you're travelling and looking for things to do, it's a great way to find out about things relevant to your interests (because the people you follow are people you're interested in). Even if you're not travelling, knowing about great places to go locally or knowing that people you're interested in are going to them creates an opportunity to meet them and create a deeper relationship with them. If you go back to my party post, all the people in it but two, I heard about on Twitter and then met in real life, and now we're pretty good friends. And the more you do this, the more things you'll find out about, and the more people you'll meet. And if you follow them on Twitter, you already know a bit about what they're like. They want you to. The reverse is also true, because tweeting invites people to see what you're like, and they can make the same choices about you.<br/><br/>Inspiration and Motivation<br/>Inspiration comes from the strangest places, and the influx of tweets means there's always fresh content for your imagination. I have a follow first policy, so I'll follow just about anybody, and then periodically go through and unfollow people. I don't know who's going to plant the seed of a new blog post or new project in me, so I like to keep my options open. Motivation also happens, because Twitter is just like life. If you surround yourself with people who are ambitious, dedicated, generous, and hard-working, it's easier to be like that, and push yourself. It's easier to think that if they can plan events, launch projects, or just get up in the morning, well, so can you.<br/><br/>Learning and Lifestyle Bloggers are on Twitter. Bloggers who aren't may actually be crazy. And people blog about just about everything. If you're looking to learn something, odds are good that somebody's tweeting about it. On top of that, news services and stores are also connected, which means that you can get your news up to the minute, and find out about sales and deals as they start.As far as lifestyle, looking for new recipe ideas? Follow some caterers and see what they come up with. Need a twist for that cocktail party? Twitter's got people for that too. Wardrobe recommendations, or just want to see what other people are doing with their lives? It's all there.<br/><br/>There are some common challenges I face when talking about this, and they're legitimate obstacles. It can seem pretty daunting, especially if you're getting on the bandwagon late, like I did. I spent months following only two people and not knowing what else to do. But there are ways to overcome them, and hear they are from least frequent to most.<br/><br/>#3: Twitter is for Narcissistic Jerks<br/>I think this comes from the idea that most people tweet for and about themselves as a way of getting attention. What I don't get is why there's anything wrong with that, or why doing that makes one a narcissist or a jerk. If someone has something to say, they want to be heard. Used to be you'd stand on the street corner and yell. Now you can yell in 140 characters or less. Twitter's just a new way to be heard. Now, there are certainly narcissistic jerks on Twitter. They're pretty much everywhere. Sometimes, people are jerks. Sometimes one of those people is me, I'm sorry to say. Don't follow those people. If you don't like what someone is saying, whether that's points that they're making or detailed accounts of their bathroom activities, you don't have to listen on Twitter.<br/><br/>#2: I Can't Keep Track of It All<br/>The second obstacle people often bring up is that they just don't have time to keep track of all the things which are going on on Twitter. And you know what? That's fine. Keep track of what you can. Maybe you only wander on every few days. If you're a private user (rather than tweeting for your company), and especially a beginner, that's okay. Part of something is better than all of nothing.<br/><br/>#1 I've Got Nothing I Want to Put Out There<br/>This is by far the most frequent challenge people raise. And it doesn't even matter. You don't have to join Twitter to talk. Join it to listen. Again, your favourite authors, singers, bloggers, and newspapers are on here. This is your chance to listen to them. It's your chance to gain a window into their lives and activities, and they're inviting you to do that. Want to find out what Felicia Day is going to be up to at the San Diego Comic Con? Done. I know people who only listen on Twitter, and that's great. That's what I did for a while. Eventually, maybe you'll find something to tweet about, or make something to tweet about. I hope you do, because I want to hear about it.<br/><br/>In short, if you're not using Twitter, I think you should be. If you're not using it to its full extent, try to. Don't be afraid to follow five hundred people, if all of those people are saying things you're interested in. Invite those people into bits of your life, and see how it's improved by the interaction. I look forward to hearing from you. | Pse duhet të jeni në Twitter<br/><br/>Mohimi: Unë nuk jam, as nuk kam pretenduar se jam, një guru i mediave sociale.Unë jam vetëm një person që mendon për gjëra shumë, dhe kjo ka ardhur disa herë.<br/><br/>Unë nuk jam një adoptues i hershëm. Ndonjëherë më duhen vite për të kuptuar se çfarë dua të përdor diçka para se të hyj në të, dhe Twitter ishte një nga ato gjëra.Unë kam qenë në Twitter seriozisht që nga rreth shkurtit të këtij viti, kështu që jam shumë i ri në të.

| Root Canals<br/><br/>The very thought of getting a root canal puts most people on edge. SCM Dental utilizes the latest technology and technique to make a root canal a virtually pain free and low stress procedure.<br/><br/>Rotary endodontics is an advanced technology and technique to perform endodontic treatment, the clinical term for a root canalThe term "root canal" refers to the natural cavity at the center of the tooth. The tooth's nerve is located in soft tissue (pulp) inside the root canal. If the tooth is damaged either by trauma or decay, debris can enter the sensitive root canal area and cause an infection, or in extreme circumstances, and abscess. An abscessed tooth is very serious and should be treated as an emergency, as it can create an infection that may spread to other parts of the body. If you believe you have an abscessed tooth, contact our office immediately to schedule emergency care.<br/><br/>Depending on the case, root canal therapy may require more than one visit. An initial x-ray will be taken to evaluate the tooth and root canal and determine the extent of the damage and infection if present. You will be given a form of anesthesia to make you relaxed.<br/><br/>When the area is numb, our dentist will create an access chamber to the root canal using an electric handpiece. Next, the root canal will be scraped of the infected or damaged tissue and nerve. Once the entire area has been throughly cleaned and polished, the tooth will be filled with a biocompatible rubber compound called gutta percha. The tooth is then covered with a dental filling or dental crown to restore strength and function.<br/><br/>Endodontic therapy has a bad reputation as being a painful procedure. With rotary endodontics, a root canal procedure is no more painful than having a dental filling placed. The infection and damage to the nerve is what creates the extreme pain and discomfort and patients you will experience significant relief after undergoing root canal therapy. Root canals have a success rate of 95% and allow people to preserve their natural teeth. | Kanalet e rrënjës<br/><br/>Mendimi i vërtetë për marrjen e një kanali rrënjë vë shumicën e njerëzve në avantazh.SCM Dental përdor teknologjinë dhe teknikën më të fundit për të bërë një kanal rrënjë një dhimbje pothuajse të lirë dhe me stres të ulët.<br/><br/>Endodoncia rrotulluese është një teknologji dhe teknikë e përparuar për të kryer trajtim endodontik, termi klinik për një kanal rrënjë Termi "kanal rrënjë" i referohet zgavrës natyrore në qendër të dhëmbit.

| Churchyard Bottom Wood<br/><br/>Highgate<br/><br/>Churchyard Bottom Wood, Highgate<br/><br/>Now called Queen's Wood<br/><br/>Between 1860 and 1880 the centre was torn out of the City of London to build sewers, railways and new roads. Houses were demolished without regard for the tenants who had to find whatever accommodation they could elsewhere. Managers went to livo in Kensington and St. John's Wood, while the poorest crowded into the rookeries like Seven Dials and Lisson Grove. For those between, the clerks and skilled workmen, speculative builders put up row after row of terraced villas and Mr Pooter moved into Holloway. The people of Muswell Hill watched houses creep across the fields of Finsbury Park, up Crouch Hill and down the other side, so that by 1880, Crouch End was being developed and there seemed no way to stem the flow. Ten years later the large estates of Muswell Hill were being sold. Upton Farm was sold and the Ecclesiastical Commissioners wanted to develop Churchyard Bottom Wood, now called Queen's Wood. The story would have made an Ibsen play. Two groups of honest, highly motivated people fighting for what they each thought was right. The Ecclesiastical Commissioners on the one hand and the Committee of the Hornsey Charities on the other, both believed they were doing their best for other people, and the public rose against them both in indignation<br/><br/>At that time Muswell Hill Road was a country road, with Southwood Hall at one end and Upton Farm at the other. By 1894, Onslow Gardens was built, Connaught Gardens marked out, and builders were poised to develop the Woodlands estate. Cut out of Churchyard Bottom Wood was a group of tumble-down cottages, on a triangular site. An undated map, held by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners shows six Wasteland Cottages with an opening between them - not a road, not metalled, but a way through to the strawberry beds behind. Further along was another gap which led to footpaths through the wood. These two openings were to be the basis of the plan. The same two gaps and the cleared ground, which was the strawberry field, can be seen in the 1894 map below. They are shown as 'Muswell Hill Cottages' and, quite in passing, Peter Sellers was to live on the same site much later on. To develop the wood as a housing estate, the Commissioners needed to drive two roads through from Muswell Hill Road and build houses along them. The Muswell Hill Road frontage alone would not have provided room for enough houses to make the venture worthwhile.<br/><br/>The land and cottages had been given much earlier as almshouses to house old people and were held on their behalf by the Trustees of the Hornsey Charity Commissioners. By the 1890s the cottages were tumble-down, in need of major repair. Public-spirited, wishing to do the best for their old tenants, the Trustees could not improve them since they had no money. Some years before the Ecclesiastical Commissioners had planned to develop Gravel Pit Wood (now Highgate Wood) as a housing estate, but this had met such opposition that they backed down. Instead, in 1886, they gave all 69 acres woodland to the public. At the same time they offered to sell Churchyard Bottom Wood to Hornsey Urban District Council for £25,000, but this was too much for Hornsey to raise on its own. The Council said that people living outside Hornsey also enjoyed the wood and other authorities should help, but no help was given. In the end the offer fell into abeyance.<br/><br/>Map showing the Muswell Hill Cottages which were the centre of the controversy.<br/><br/>Muswell Hill Road about 1880<br/><br/>It seems probable that these three pairs of cottages<br/>were the ones at the centre of the dispute.<br/><br/>The Ecclesiastical Commissioners wanted to raise money for its church work in Britain and abroad. They considered that they had been given the land to be used for the propogat­ion of religion and if this meant selling off land or woods, it was a lesser evil than restricting the work of the church. They had given Gravel Pit Wood to the public: in its place they would develop Churchyard Bottom Wood.<br/><br/>The Trustees of the Hornsey Charities wanted to produce an income to help their poor people, so they made an offer to the Commissioners. Their triangular piece of land was too awkwardly shaped to be developed economically, but if the Commissioners would grant them some more land to make it into a square site, they would build twenty-five neat villas. These would bring in ground rents of £225 per annum, which could be used to relieve the poverty of Hornsey people. In return they would permit the Commission­ers to cut two roads through their land so that the Commissioners could develop the woods.<br/><br/>When this offer became known people immediately reacted with alarm.<br/><br/>On the 16th December 1893 Mr Carvell Williams MP asked in the House of Commons, if the Ecclesiastical Commissioners had consented to sell a strip of land to the Hornsey Charities Trustees on condition that an existing road be widened to 40 feet, whether this was a preliminary to a building scheme and if the House of Parliament would have an opportunity to express an opinion.<br/><br/>Mr Leveson Gower, a Church Estates Commissioner replied',"Yes" to the first part.<br/><br/>Mr Carvell Williams, "Do I understand it is the intention to destroy that portion of Highgate Woods by building on it?"<br/><br/>Two days later The Star published an article worthy of any modern tabloid.<br/><br/>The Star<br/>18th December 1893<br/><br/>'Parliament must keep a keen watch on those old vandals and confederates of the jerry-builder the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. They are always alienating some piece of land or are favouring the builders as opposed to the general public. The Commissioners would not sell the Churchyard Bottom wood to the ratepayers but now propose 'to open it up' by cutting two wide roads through it in connection with one of their numerous building schemes. Will not someone ask a question in Parliament and check the brick and mortar policy of the Commissioners?'<br/><br/>By the time this was printed, the question had been asked and the answer was either untrue, or devious. Other papers took up the story. The Times, in a long report, said that the Comnussioners were not prepared to give an undertaking that Parliament, or any other public body, should have an opportunity of considering any scheme for building on the site of the wood.<br/><br/>The situation simmered for eighteen months until the Ecclesiastical Commissioners were forced to open an enquiry, which began at Highgate on 31 May 1895, chaired by an Assistant Ecclesiastical Commissioner. The Inquiry produced a flurry of newspaper letters of which this was the most important.<br/><br/>The Daily Chronicle, 5 June 1895<br/><br/>VANDALISM AT HIGHGATE<br/><br/>Sir –<br/><br/>One of the most lovely bits of woodland in suburan London is threatened. Will you help us to ward off what would be a calamity, not only to the immediate district, but to the whole of densely-populated North London? In no part of the metropolis has the builder been more active than in Crouch End and Hornsey. The beautiful meadows of a year or two ago are now houses and shops. Ballast heaps have taken the place of stately elms and chestnuts, and once pleasant villages are sharing the fate of Stroud Green, Harringay, Finsbury Park, Highbury and Islington. ---<br/><br/>---- The object is the construction of two forty-foot roads through the woods. We in this district know the meaning of forty-foot roads through woods. It means that the woods are doomed. Ten years ago agitation saved the sister-wood of sixty-five acres - The Gravel Pit Woods - and no one who saw the Bank Holiday crowds flocking up the Archway Road from the dreary streets of Holloway, Islington and Clerkenwell, and watched the keen enjoyment of the children and family parties picnicking on the grass and among the trees, could fail to realise the immense boon that the grant by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners of this wood has been to the whole of North London, but the Lower Wood of sixty acres has always been regarded as a natural complement of the other. ----<br/><br/>--- The Ecclesiastical Commissioners own nearly one-third of the large parish of Hornsey. By the liberal expenditure of the ratepayers' money in the opening up of roads and the general development of the district, the value of their property has been enormously increased, and from this unearned increment they each year draw large revenues. Surely the ratepayers whose money has thus aided in creating the immense estate may expect liberal treatment in return. ---<br/><br/>Yours obediently,<br/><br/>Signed by The Vicar of St James', Muswell Hill, the Minister of Park Chapel, Crouch End, a barrister living in Onslow Gardens and three members of the District Council.<br/><br/>It was a shot right across the bows of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. Their own religious leaders and the District Council, all up in arms saying in effect that the church was too rich and should be charitable, not greedy. The inclusion of the two clergymen was a shrewd move. Remember to that this was still in the height of the Darwin controversy. Darwin had split belief in the teachings of the Church and many people would have resented the power of the Church from that point of view alone. The Church was not so secure as it pretended to be.<br/><br/>The Evening News, 7 June 1895 said:-<br/><br/>"If the Ecclesiastical Comnussioners are not tackled at once, the building octopus will get a grip of the wood which will be very difficult to loosen later on, ---. Therefore it behoves Londoners to be up and doing if they would save one of their most delightful bits of rustic scenery. The public inquiry stands adjourned to Thursday next, and before then something must be done to convince the Commissioners that the citizens of London will not tolerate the confiscation of one of their favourite playgrounds."<br/><br/>A letter in the Daily Chronicle the next day said:-<br/><br/>.... It was with great relief that that the residents, some ten years ago, heard that the purchase of the Upper Wood had been effected; and how delightful a boon this has proved, anyone who visited them can testify, but all who exerted themselves to save these upper woods, which lie on the west side of Muswell Hill road, felt that their victory was incomplete so long as the sixty acres on the east side remained in danger. It is, as it were, an accident that the woods are divided by a broad high road. Can anyone doubt what the effect would be if the Churchyard Bottom Wood were replaced by rows of small villas, each sending out its contribution of smoke and soot? Can anyone doubt, too, the serious difference it would make to the picturesque setting of the purchased woods if a line of staring new houses were to be run up right over against their leafy frontage?'<br/><br/>This expressed the opinions of many people. In fact, the Gravel Pit Wood, which the writer calls the 'Upper Wood', had not been purchased, but given to the district by the Ecclesiastical Commission, a point they were to reiterate time and again over the years, but most people ignored it. The Commission was not going to give away a second wood whatever anyone said, and held this position to the end.<br/><br/>H.S.Chamberlain, of 5 Cranley Gardens,<br/>in a letter to the Times dated June 8, 1895, urged purchase.<br/><br/>I know that it is common to speak harshly of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, but as the trustees of a fund they are bound to administer it to the greatest advantage, and therefore, if anything is to be done to save the demolition of the wood, it appears to me that it can only be effected by the purchase of the property from the Comnussioners, who I know, are fully alive to the protection of free and open spaces for the people, and who, I feel sure, would be disposed to treat the matter of a purchase in a free and liberal spirit, as they have already done in the matter of the Shepherd's Cot-field, by granting a lease to the Crouch End Playing-fields Company - a small company in which I own a few shares, a small company which was formed exclusively for the purpose of securing the fields for cricket, tennis etc.<br/><br/>(This refers the the Crouch End Playing Fields which had been secured a few years later.)<br/><br/>As Chairman of the Muswell Hill Conservative Association, I am constantly in touch with the inhabitants, and I can safely affirm that every person resident in the neighbourhood would do anything in reason to preserve.<br/><br/>(All he wanted personally was Charity income to support his poor people. He demanded his acre of land - not a great deal surely - he believed the Commissioners' assurance that the wood was not in danger.)<br/><br/>' Muswell Hill Road was one of the best in Hornsey and would remain equally beautiful, houses or no houses',<br/><br/>(and then came the great rhetorical flourish.)<br/><br/>'Are the poor to suffer because of the sentimental objections and the hysterical cry of 'wolf just raised by your correspondents? Something must be done and that soon. An acre of back-land added to the charity-estate would make no apprec­iable difference to the land remaining, while the profit derived from it would succour many poor old and deserving persons in their declining years and enable us to hand over to our successors an estate which in the distant future would be of great value in the rendering of charitable aid to the deserving poor of the parish of Hornsey.'<br/><br/>Reading his letter one senses hysteria very near the surface. Why did he think the Commissioners wanted to build a road? Why should they spend all that money if not to build houses? He never seemed to realise that for an acre of land the the whole wood would be lost. But he had been with the problem for a long time. He was the person to whom the Commissioners had made the offer of sale for £25,000 years before and it is his name which is honoured in a plaque on Crouch End Clock Tower for saving the wood, but his trust in the Ecclesiastical Commissioners seems naive. It is sad that at the Inquiry he was to be cast as the devil.<br/><br/>The Inquiry Continued<br/><br/>The adjourned opened in Highgate on 15 June 1895. Expecting a large gather­ing, the Council Chamber had been changed completely. The usual tables had been removed and the room filled with chairs. By half past seven the room was crowded, with people jostling for seats.<br/><br/>Mr Murray, the Commissioner, said the Inquiry was really a simple one. Hornsey Parochial Charities wished to purchase a piece of land adjoining their charity property at the back. The question was whether the Charity Commission, which controlled all charities, had enough power to stop them. The Church Commissioners were prepared to sell the land at very favourable terms and the income of the Charity would be very considerable increased.<br/><br/>Against this there were three classes of objection.<br/><br/>The original Trust was for the purpose of providing cottages for the Poor, but the trustees were proposing to build villas which would be too expensive for the Poor. However, it was within the power of the Trustees to vary the terms of the Trust, so they could build villas if they thought that the Poor would benefit in the end. The poor people themselves might object, but liberal provisions had already been promised for them. The third objection related to the aesthetic and public side of the question. He took it from what he had read that the Charity Commission ought to interfere to prevent the Ecclesiastical Commissioners from exercising their own discretion in dealing with their own property.<br/><br/>The Inquiry discussed fine points, but the speakers kept coming back to the major problem of preventing any destruction of the wood. The Vestry Clerk of Islington, representing 300,000 people, made a formal protest about any part of the wood, so valuable for the people of Islington and Hornsey being used for private purposes. Mr Wilfred White said that if the Commissioners would give them time they would be able to raise the money to compensate the Trustees.<br/><br/>Mr Beaumont said they did not want villas, they wanted cottages for poor people who were being driven out of the district. Others said that there was no money to build cottages to replace the present delapidated ones but villas would be an economic proposition. Others retorted that there were score of villas to let in Highgate. The Wood was sacred. Stick to the question of the Wood.<br/><br/>Dr Fletcher said the cry among the working people was that there was nowhere to go. Working people came to him with the cry, "We are driven out of Highgate and are obliged to go to Highgate New Town." If the Muswell Hill Road frontage was sold there was no question but that roads might be cut right through the woods in the direction of Hornsey, but if the Commissioners could not get the land from the Charity Commission they could not cut the road.<br/><br/>He was very sure the cottages could be put into a fit state of repair. He was asked by the poor people, by the police and by a number of the working classes to represent these two points, that cottage accommodation was very sorely needed in Highgate and that if they once allowed the land to be sold, there was no telling where the hand of the builder would be stayed.<br/><br/>(Loud and prolonged cheers).<br/><br/>Numerous other people spoke and the Comnussioner summed up by saying that he took it that the prevailing opinion was in favour of retaining the cottages but the meeting should draw no conclusions from what he had said (Groans).<br/><br/>Others said that the Trustees of the Charity had failed in their duties by letting the the cottages fall into disrepair.<br/><br/>Mr H.R.Williams, the Trustee who had written to the paper earlier, said that he had it on the best authority that the Church Commissioners would make no roads whatever and they would not be benefitted one iota by the actions of the Charity Commissioners. Others were far less trusting and the meeting closed after nearly three hours.<br/><br/>'We are faced with the fact that in Highgate and Muswell Hill there are a number of persons who want the Churchyard Bottom Wood and will not be happy until they have got it - while nobody appears willing to spend a farthing to pay for it. Everyone says it would be a fine thing to have the wood as open space, but everybody thinks it is the duty of someone else to make it one. The Islington Vestry has 'resolved' on the subject, but the Islington Vestry does not offer a penny piece towards the purchase. --- There is no more difficult problem for the community or the individual to solve than how to gain possession of other people's property without paying for it.'<br/><br/>Paying for it was indeed the problem as Churchyard Bottom Wood became the subject of intense local and national debate. A joint committee was formed to raise money to save the wood. On 20 November 1896, C.F.Cory-Wright, Hon Treasurer, wrote to The Standard, a daily paper at that time, appealing for help. He reminded everyone of the danger of losing the wood and said it could only be saved by buying it. The Church Commissioners would sell for £25,000 and an extra (5,000 would be required for fencing and drainage, making a total of £30,000. This was too much for Hornsey Council to raise but they had already voted £10,000 towards the total. The woods were of inestimable value to all of North London so he appealed to public bodies and private people to raise the remaining £20,000. He warned that the present offer from the Church Commissioners was open only to the end of 1898. After that the builders would move in.<br/><br/>The appeal was warmly welcomed by the press. A Private Bill was rushed through Parliament and the Highgate Woods Preservation Act, 1897, became law. The Conunittee now had the right to advertise for contributions towards buying the Wood and preserving it.<br/><br/>In a fairly short time almost all the money was raised, but the last few thousand proved very difficult to raise and the Commissioners' deadline was a matter of weeks away. Mr Cory-Wright wrote pleading for more time but was granted a mere three months and then only if interest at 4 per cent was paid for the extra period on the full sum. In the end the London County Council, which had originally offered £2,500, made this up to £5,000 and the total was reached, but it was a close-run thing.<br/><br/>The Council decided to re-name the Wood as 'Queen's Woods' in honour of Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee and Hornsey put on a fine display of bunting when the Duchess of Albany formally declared the Wood open 'for the free use of the public for ever'.<br/><br/>While the campaign to save Churchyard Bottom Wood was run and directed by local people who felt passionately about this particular piece of woodland, they called on the help and experience of a vast network of people, some of whom had worked together on similar campaigns for over thirty years. The Committee issued an appeal, printed on very good quality paper and bearing some famous names.<br/><br/>The questions of open space and public health were major subjects of the Victorian vision.<br/><br/>The Open Spaces Movement<br/><br/>Octavia Hill, the great housing reformer, who had begun with three old houses in Marylebone, bought for her by Jolm Ruskin, had quickly become an expert on housing poor people in the healthiest conditions possible. Her way was to buy leases and then knock down some of the crowded houses in order to bring light and air to the rest, believing that fresh air and sunlight were the the only way poor people could be saved from 'putrid fever. She had learnt this as a child from her grandfather, Southwood Smith, who developed his theories at the Fever Hospital at King's Cross.<br/><br/>He had built the first Industrial Dwellings for poor people and had proved statistically that good air and decent drainage saved lives. Gibson Gardens, in Northwold Road, is a direct outcome of Southwood Smith's ideas. More Information on Gibson Gardens<br/><br/>The Importance of Open Air<br/><br/>Open spaces and the opportunity to breathe clean air, were essential for people living in one or two crowded rooms. Octavia Hill took her charges from the Lisson Grove slums, up Fitzjohn's Avenue to Hampstead Heath. She so loved the Fitzjohn's Avenue fields that she tried to buy them as a public park. They were to cost £10,000 and within three August weeks £8,500 had been raised. It needed only the end of the summer holidays and the return from holiday of sympathetic friends and the further £1,500 would have been raised, but the owners suddenly withdrew their offer. Despite all pleading, the fields were covered with large houses.<br/><br/>From this developed the campaign to save Parliament Hill, the next open space northwards from Lisson Grove, buying up fields in the path of the builders to make a permanent cordon sanitalre against the advancing bricks. The Parliament Hill Fields campaign was so successful that the Hampstead Heath Bill was passed and there was money over from the appeal. From this money and the impetus towards open spaces, was to develop the National Trust. Octavia Hill had been interested in protecting areas like Church Bottom Wood for years, so she was a natural ally in the fight to save the Wood.<br/><br/>The Commons Preservation Society also, was familiar with this kind of agitation and money collection. They had torn down fencing when lords of the manor had enclosed pieces of common land, leading both legal and illegal battles against the arrogant privatization of land traditionally free. Robert Hunter, their Honorary Solicitor from 1868, was always concerned with securing open spaces, large or small, for the public. He, now Sir Robert Hunter, became the Chairman of the Church Bottom Appeal. The Chairman of the Commons Preservation Society was Mr Shaw-Lefevre MP (later Lord Eversley) who played a big part in this and other campaigns in the House of Commons. Octavia Hill had been involved in their work from about 1875.<br/><br/>At the same time Octavia Hill was campaigning for a Burials Bill.<br/><br/>City churchyards had become so full and such a serious a hazard to health, by contaminating wells from which people drew their drinking water, that City burials were no longer permitted. Instead, cemetries were created on the outskirts of town. Abney Park Cemetary was one of these. There was then a movement to remove the headstones to the edges of the old town cemetries, re-inter the bodies elsewhere and turn the cemetries into gardens and open spaces, instead of building on them. This land in the centre of London was very valuable and speculators were avid to obtain it: Even the Quakers had built over one of their cemetries and threatened to do so again by building over Bunhill Fields. Octavia Hill had a network of allies in a dozen fields, so her help to save the Church Bottom Wood must have been invaluable.<br/><br/>The Metropolitan Gardens Society, set up in 1882, had laid out about two hundred small gardens in city centres by 1890. They later handed them over to the Local Authorities, so their support for the Churchyard Bottom Wood Appeal was assured from the start.<br/><br/>The Kyrle Society is forgotten now, but in its day had great influence on Town Planning and Open Space legislation. The Society had been set up about 1875 for 'the Diffusion of Beauty', to bring colour and interest into the lives of people living in dull, drab surroundings. Bright colour to walls and decoration, good singing, open spaces, Nature, Literature and Art. All these fell within the Society's remit. There was a Decorative Branch, for whom William Morris lectured; a Musical Branch to promote choirs and Happy Evenings for people in local school buildings; and a Literature Branch. The Society appealed regularly by letters in The Times, to 'the richer classes' for books and periodicals to be distributed to boys' and girls' clubs, almshouses and elsewhere. However the Open Spaces Committee was the most active. The very name 'Kyrle' came from Pope's The Man of Ross, the philanthropist who gave his birthplace to the people as a public park. | Churchyard Bottom Wood<br/><br/>Highgate<br/><br/>Churchyard Bottom Wood, Highgate<br/><br/>Tani quhet Druri i Mbretëreshës<br/><br/>Midis viteve 1860 dhe 1880 qendra u nxorr nga Qyteti i Londrës për të ndërtuar kanalizime, hekurudha dhe rrugë të reja.Shtëpia u shkatërruan pa marrë parasysh qiramarrësit që duhej të gjenin çfarëdo akomodimi që mund të gjenin diku tjetër. Menaxherët shkuan për të jetuar në Kensington dhe St. John's Wood, ndërsa më të varfrit u rritën me fillestare si Shtatë Dials dhe Lisson Grove. Për ata mes tyre, nëpunësit dhe punëtorët e aftë, ndërtuesit spekulativ rreshtuan pas rreshtit të vilave të tarracuara dhe z Pooter u zhvendosën në Holloway. Njerëzit e Muswell Hill shikuar shtëpitë zvarriten në të gjithë fushat e Finsbury Park, lart Crouch Hill dhe poshtë në anën tjetër, kështu që deri në 1880, Crouch End ishte duke u zhvilluar dhe nuk dukej asnjë mënyrë për të prishur rrjedhën. Dhjetë vjet më vonë u shitën pasuritë e mëdha të Muswell Hill-it, ndërsa në Fermën Uton u shit dhe komisarët e kishës donin të zhvillonin drurin Bottom, të quajtur tani Druri i Mbretëreshës. Dy grupe njerëzish të ndershëm e shumë të motivuar që luftonin për atë që mendonin se kishte të drejtë. Nga njëra anë, Komisionerët Eklisiastikë dhe Komiteti i Bamirësive Hornsey, të dy besonin se po bënin më të mirën për njerëzit e tjerë, dhe publiku u ngrit kundër tyre si në indinjatë.<br/><br/>Në atë kohë Rruga Muswell Hill ishte një rrugë fshati, me Sallën e Southwood-it në njërin skaj dhe Fermën Upton në anën tjetër. Deri në vitin 1894, Kopshtet Onslow u ndërtuan, Kopshtet Connaught shënuan, dhe ndërtuesit ishin të gatshëm për të zhvilluar pasuritë Woodlands. Pritini nga Pothuaj e Kishës ishte një grup vilash, në një vend trekëndësh. Një hartë e pabotuar, e mbajtur nga Komisionerët Eklisikues tregon gjashtë vila djerrinësh me një hapje midis tyre - jo një rrugë, jo të metalosur, por një rrugë nëpër shtretërit e luleshtrydheve prapa. Së bashku ishte një tjetër hendek i cili çoi në shtigje përmes drurit.Këto dy hapje do të ishin baza e planit.I njëjti dy boshllëqe dhe terreni i pastruar, i cili ishte fusha e luleshtrydheve, mund të shihet në hartën 1894 më poshtë. Ato shfaqen si 'Kotesat e Muswell Hill' dhe, mjaft në kalimin, Peter Shitësit ishte të jetonin në të njëjtin vend shumë më vonë. Për të zhvilluar pyllin si një pasuri banimi, Komisionerët duhej të udhëtonin dy rrugë përmes rrugës “Muswell Hill” dhe të ndërtonin shtëpi përgjatë tyre. Frontamenti i Rrugës Muswell Hill nuk do të kishte ofruar hapësirë për shtëpi të mjaftueshme për ta bërë sipërmarrjen të vlefshme.<br/><br/>Toka dhe vilat u ishin dhënë shumë më parë si almhouses për të strehuar njerëz të vjetër dhe u mbajtën në emër të tyre nga Trustesët e Komisionerëve të Bamirësisë Hornsey. Deri në vitet 1890 vilat ishin me ngarkesë, në nevojë për riparim të madh. Shpirti publik, që dëshiron të bëjë më të mirën për qiramarrësit e tyre të vjetër, të Besuarit nuk mund t’i përmirësonin pasi nuk kishin para. Disa vite para se Komisariatët Elastikës të kishin planifikuar zhvillimin e zhavorrit Pit Wood (tashmë Highgate Wood) si një pasuri banimi, por kjo kishte takuar një opozitë të tillë që ata mbështeteshin, në vitin 1886, ata i dhanë të gjitha 69 hektarë drurë publikut. Në të njëjtën kohë ata ofruan të shisnin drutë e kishës në Këshillin e Rrethit Urban të Hornsey për 25,000 £, por kjo ishte shumë për Hornsey për t'u rritur më vete. Këshilli tha se njerëzit që jetonin jashtë Hornsey gjithashtu gëzonin drurin dhe autoritetet e tjera duhet të ndihmonin, por nuk u dha asnjë ndihmë.Në fund oferta ra në rënie.<br/><br/>Harta që shfaqte Vilat Muswell Hill të cilat ishin qendra e polemikave.<br/><br/>Muswell Hill Rruga rreth 1880<br/><br/>Duket e mundshme që këto tre çifte vilash ishin ato në qendër të mosmarrëveshjes.<br/><br/>Komisionerët e Eklisiacisë donin të mblidhnin para për punën e saj kishtare në Britani dhe jashtë saj. Ata konsideronin se u ishte dhënë toka për t’u përdorur për propagandimin e fesë dhe nëse kjo nënkuptonte shitjen e tokës ose pyjeve, ishte një e keqe më e vogël se sa kufizimi i punës së kishës. Ata i kishin dhënë Gravel Pit Wood publikut: në vendin e saj ata do të zhvillonin dru në fund të Kishës.<br/><br/>Të besuarit e Bamirësive të Hornsey donin të prodhonin të ardhura për të ndihmuar njerëzit e tyre të varfër, kështu që ata i ofroheshin Komisionerëve. Pjesa e tyre trekëndëshe e tokës ishte shumë e formësuar nga pikëpamja ekonomike, por nëse Komisionerët do t’u jepnin atyre më shumë tokë për ta bërë atë një vend katror, ata do të ndërtonin njëzet e pesë vila të bukura. Këto do të sillnin qira në terren të 225 £ në vit, të cilat mund të përdoreshin për të lehtësuar varfërinë e njerëzve Hornsey. Në këmbim ata do të lejonin Komisionin­ers të thyente dy rrugë nëpër tokë në mënyrë që Komisionerët të mund të zhvillonin pyllin.<br/><br/>Kur kjo ofertë u bë e njohur njerëzit menjëherë reaguan me alarm.<br/><br/>Më 16 dhjetor 1893 zoti Carvell Williams, pyeti deputetin e Dhomës së Komonëve, nëse Komisionerët e Eklicisë kishin pranuar të shiste një rrip toke tek fisi i Hornsey, me kusht që një rrugë ekzistuese të zgjerohej në 40 këmbë, nëse kjo ishte paraprake për një skemë ndërtimi dhe nëse Shtëpia e Parlamentit do të kishte mundësi të shprehte një mendim.<br/><br/>Z. Leveson Gower, një Komision i Pronave të Kishës iu përgjigj', "Po" në pjesën e parë.<br/><br/>Zoti Carvell Williams, "A e kuptoj se është qëllimi për të shkatërruar atë pjesë të Highgate Woods duke ndërtuar në të?"<br/><br/>Dy ditë më vonë The Star botoi një artikull të denjë për çdo tabloid modern.<br/><br/>Ylli<br/>18 dhjetor 1893<br/><br/>'Parlamenti duhet të mbajë një vështrim të mprehtë mbi ato vandalë të vjetër dhe konfederata të kryebashkisë së argjendarëve, gjithmonë janë jashtëtokësore ose janë duke i favorizuar ndërtuesit në krahasim me publikun e gjerë. Komisionet nuk do të shesë drurin e Kishës në Fund me ritme, por tani do të propozojë 'të hapet' duke prerë dy rrugë të gjera përmes saj në lidhje me një nga skemat e tyre të shumta të ndërtimit. A nuk do të bëjë dikush pyetje në Parlament dhe të kontrollojë politikën e tullave dhe llaçve të Komisionerëve?'<br/><br/>Në kohën kur kjo u shtyp, çështja ishte bërë dhe përgjigja ishte e pavërtetë, ose e turpshme. Koha, në një raport të gjatë, tha se Konsumatorët nuk ishin të përgatitur për të dhënë një sipërmarrje që Parlamenti apo ndonjë organ tjetër publik, duhet të kenë mundësinë të marrin në konsideratë çdo skemë për ndërtimin në vendin e drurit.<br/><br/>Situata zinte për tetëmbëdhjetë muaj derisa Komisionerët Eklizarë të detyroheshin të hapnin një hetim, i cili filloi në Highgate më 31 maj 1895, i kryesuar nga një Ndihmës Komisioneri Eklizar. Hetimi prodhoi një valë letrash të gazetave, nga të cilat kjo ishte më e rëndësishmja.<br/><br/>Kronika ditore, 5 qershor 1895<br/><br/>VANDALISMI NË HighGATE<br/><br/>Zotëri –<br/><br/>Një nga copëzat më të bukura të pyllit në Londrën periferike kërcënohet.A do të na ndihmoni të largonim atë që do të ishte një fatkeqësi, jo vetëm në rrethin e menjëhershëm, por në tërë Londrën Veriore me popullsi të dendur? Në asnjë pjesë të metropolit nuk ka qenë ndërtuesi më aktiv se në Crouch End dhe Hornsey, livadhet e bukura të një viti ose dy më parë janë tani shtëpi dhe dyqane. Majat e ballost-it kanë zënë vendin e elemeve dhe gështenjave, dhe pasi fshatrat e këndshme ndajnë fatin e Stroud Green, Haringay, Finsbury Park, Highbury dhe Islington. ---<br/><br/>Objekti është ndërtimi i dy rrugëve dyzet-këmbëshe nëpër pyll.Ne në këtë rreth dimë kuptimin e rrugëve dyzet-këmbësh nëpër pyje, që do të thotë se pyjet janë të dënuara. Dhjetë vjet më parë, agjitacioni shpëtoi motrën e drurit të gjashtëdhjetë e pesë hektarëve - Pylli i Grave - dhe askush që pa turmat e Festave të Bankës që dynden nga rrugët elbta të Holloways, Islington dhe Clerkenwell, dhe shihte kënaqësinë e mprehtë të fëmijëve dhe partive familjare që pikonin mbi bar dhe midis pemëve, mund të dështonin të realizonte një ndihmë të pamasë nga komisarët e kësaj peme, por Druri i Poshtëm i gjashtëdhjetë hektarëve është konsideruar gjithmonë si një plotësim natyral i tjetrit. ---<br/><br/>--- Komisionerët Eklistike zotërojnë gati një të tretën e parisë së madhe të Hornsey. Me shpenzimet liberale të parave të aktorëve në hapjen e rrugëve dhe zhvillimin e përgjithshëm të rrethit, vlera e pronës së tyre është rritur ndjeshëm dhe nga kjo rritje e pamerituar ata çdo vit tërheqin të ardhura të mëdha. Me siguri që shortarët, paratë e të cilëve kanë ndihmuar në krijimin e pasurisë së madhe mund të presin trajtimin liberal në këmbim. ---<br/><br/>E juaja bindur,<br/><br/>Nënshkruar nga The Vicar of St James', Muswell Hill, Ministri i Parkut Chapel, Crouch End, një barrierë që jeton në Onslow Gardens dhe tre anëtarë të Këshillit të Qarkut.<br/><br/>Ishte një pozë në të gjithë harqet e Komisionerëve Eklishtare. Krerët e tyre fetarë dhe Këshillin e Qarkut, të gjithë në krahë duke thënë në mënyrë të efektshme që kisha të ishte shumë e pasur dhe të mos ishte bamirëse. Përfshirja e dy klerikëve ishte një lëvizje e matur, mos harroni se kjo ishte ende në kulmin e polemikave të Darvinit. Darvini kishte ndarë besimin në mësimet e Kishës dhe shumë njerëz do të kishin përfaqësuar fuqinë e Kishës nga ajo pikëpamje vetëm. Kisha nuk ishte aq e sigurt sa pretendonte të ishte.<br/><br/>The Evening News, 7 qershor 1895 tha:<br/><br/>Nëse Komplotuesit Eklizarë nuk janë trajtuar në të njëjtën kohë, oktapodi i ndërtesës do të marrë një kontroll të drurit i cili do të jetë shumë i vështirë për t'u liruar më vonë, ---. Prandaj, i bën hokaxhinjve të jenë gati dhe të bëjnë nëse do të shpëtonin një nga copëzat e tyre më të këndshme të peizazhit rustik. Kërkesa publike mbetet e kthyer të enjten më pas, dhe para se të bëhet diçka për të bindur Komisionerët se qytetarët e Londrës nuk do të tolerojnë konfiskimin e një prej lojërave të tyre të preferuara."<br/><br/>Një letër në Kronikan e Përditshme të nesërmen tha:-<br/><br/>... Ishte me shumë lehtësim se banorët, para rreth dhjetë vjetësh, dëgjuan se ishte bërë blerja e Drurit të Sipërm; dhe se sa i lezetshëm ka provuar një boun, kushdo që i vizitoi ata mund të dëshmonte, por të gjithë ata që ushtruan për të shpëtuar këto pyje të sipërme, që shtrihen në anën perëndimore të rrugës Muswell Hill, mendonin se fitorja e tyre ishte e paplotë sa kohë që gjashtëdhjetë hektarë në anën lindore mbetën në rrezik. Është, siç ishte, një aksident që pyjet ndahen nga një rrugë e lartë e gjerë.A mund të dyshojë dikush se cili do të ishte efekti nëse druri i poshtme i Kishës do të zëvendësohej nga rreshtat e vilave të vogla, secili duke dërguar kontributin e tij të tymit dhe blozës? A mund të dyshojë dikush, gjithashtu, ndryshimi serioz që do të bënte në vendosjen piktoreske të pyjeve të blera nëse një rresht për të hapur shtëpi të reja do të drejtoheshin kundër fasadës së tyre me gjethe?'<br/><br/>Kjo shprehu mendimet e shumë njerëzve. Në fakt, Varri i Grovelit, të cilin shkrimtari e quan ‘Pushin e Sipërm’, nuk ishte blerë, por i ishte dhënë rrethit nga Komisioni Eklisiatik, një pikë që duhej të përsërisnin kohë dhe përsëri me kalimin e viteve, por shumica e njerëzve e kishin injoruar atë. Komisioni nuk do t’i jepte një dru të dytë çfarëdo që thoshte dikush, dhe kështu e mbajti deri në fund këtë detyrë.<br/><br/>H.S.Chamberlain, e 5 Kopshteve Cranley, në një letër për kohët e datës 8 qershor 1895, kërkoi blerje.<br/><br/>Unë e di se është e zakonshme të flasësh ashpër me Komisionerët Eklisiatikë, por siç janë besuarit e një fondi që ata janë të detyruar ta administrojnë me përparësinë më të madhe, dhe për këtë arsye, nëse diçka duhet të bëhet për të shpëtuar shkatërrimin e drurit, më duket se mund të ndikohet vetëm nga blerja e pronës nga Konsumatorët, të cilët unë e di, janë plotësisht të gjallë për mbrojtjen e hapësirave të lira dhe të hapura për popullin, dhe të cilët, unë jam i sigurt, do të hidhen për të trajtuar çështjen e një blerjeje në një frymë të lirë dhe liberale, siç e kanë bërë tashmë në çështjen e Kompanisë së Fushës së Lojës së Bërthjeve-Shterta, duke i dhënë një kompani të vogël në të cilën unë vetë, një kompanie të vogël, e cila është formuar ekskluzivisht për të siguruar fushën e kriket, një kompani të vogël për kriket, te vogël etj.<br/><br/>(Kjo i referohet fushave të lojës së Crouch End, të cilat ishin siguruar disa vite më vonë.)<br/><br/>Si kryetar i Shoqatës Konservatore Muswell Hill, jam vazhdimisht në kontakt me banorët dhe mund të pohoj në mënyrë të sigurt se çdo person që banon në lagje do të bënte gjithçka për të ruajtur.<br/><br/>(Gjithçka që donte personalisht ishte të ardhura bamirëse për të mbështetur popullin e tij të varfër, ai kërkonte akërmin e tij të tokës - jo një marrëveshje të madhe me siguri - ai besonte në sigurinë e Komisionerëve se druri nuk ishte në rrezik.)<br/><br/>'Muswell Hill Road ishte një nga më të mirët në Hornsey dhe do të mbetej po aq i bukur, shtëpi ose pa shtëpi',<br/><br/>(dhe pastaj erdhi lulëzimi i madh retorik.)<br/><br/>'A vuajnë të varfërit për shkak të kundërshtimeve sentimentale dhe britmës histerike të ' ujkut të ngritur vetëm nga korrespodentët tuaj? Diçka duhet të bëhet dhe atë së shpejti. Një shenjë e tokës së pasme e shtuar në pronën e bamirësisë nuk do të bënte ndryshim të këndshëm në tokën e mbetur, ndërsa fitimi që rrjedh prej saj do të merrte shumë të moshuar të varfër dhe që meritojnë persona në vitet e tyre dhe do të na mundësonte t'u jepnim pasardhësve tanë një pasuri e cila në të ardhmen e largët do të ishte me vlerë të madhe në dhënien e ndihmave bamirëse për të varfërit e famullisë së Hornsey.'<br/><br/>Duke lexuar letrën e tij një ndjen histeri shumë pranë sipërfaqes. Pse mendonte se Komisionerët donin të ndërtonin një rrugë? Pse duhet të shpenzonin të gjitha ato para nëse të mos ndërtonin shtëpi? Ai kurrë nuk dukej se e kuptoi se për një akër toke do të humbiste e gjithë druri, por kishte qenë me problemin për një kohë të gjatë. Ai ishte personi për të cilin Komisionerët kishin bërë ofertën e shitjes për 25,000 £ më parë dhe është emri i tij i cili është nderuar në një pllakë në Kullën e Sahatit të Crouch për të shpëtuar drurin, por besimi i tij në Komisionerët Eklisiastikë duket naiv. Është e trishtueshme që në Kërkesë duhet të hidhej si djalli.<br/><br/>Çështja ka vazhduar<br/><br/>Më 15 qershor 1895, Dhoma e Këshillit ishte ndryshuar tërësisht. Tryezat e zakonshme ishin hequr dhe dhoma ishte mbushur me karrige. Nga gjysma e së kaluarës, shtatë dhoma ishte e mbushur me njerëz që s'mundeshin për t'u ulur.<br/><br/>Z. Murray, Komisioneri, tha se Hetimi ishte me të vërtetë një i thjeshtë. Hornsey Parchial Charity dëshironte të blinte një copë toke duke iu bashkuar pronës së tyre të bamirësisë në anën e pasme. Pyetja ishte nëse Komisioni i Bamirësisë, i cili kontrollonte të gjitha bamirësitë, kishte fuqi të mjaftueshme për t’i ndaluar ato. Komisionerët e Kishës ishin të përgatitur të shisnin tokën me kushte shumë të favorshme dhe të ardhurat e Bamirësisë do të ishin shumë të konsiderueshme.<br/><br/>Kundër kësaj kishte tre klasa kundërshtimi.<br/><br/>Besimi origjinal ishte për qëllim të ofrimit të vilave për të varfrit, por të besuarit ishin propozuar për të ndërtuar vila të cilat do të ishin shumë të shtrenjta për të Varfërit. Megjithatë, ishte brenda fuqisë së të besuarve të ndryshonin kushtet e Besimit, kështu që ata mund të ndërtonin vila në qoftë se ata mendonin se të varfrit do të përfitonin në fund. Vetë personat e varfër mund të kundërshtonin, por dispozitat liberale tashmë ishin premtuar për ta.Obeksioni i tretë lidhur me anën estetike dhe publike të pyetjes. Ai e mori nga ajo që kishte lexuar se Komisioni i Bamirësisë duhet të ndërhynte për të parandaluar që Komisionerët Eklisiastikë të ushtronin diskrecionin e tyre në trajtimin e pronës së tyre.<br/><br/>Hetimorja diskutoi pika të imëta, por folësit vazhdonin të ktheheshin te problemi kryesor i parandalimit të çdo shkatërrimi të drurit. Festry Clerk i Islingtonit, që përfaqësonte 300,000 njerëz, bënë një protestë zyrtare për çdo pjesë të drurit, kaq të vlefshme për njerëzit e Islingtonit dhe Hornsey që përdoreshin për qëllime private. Z. Wilfred White tha se nëse Komisionerët do t’u jepnin atyre kohë, ata do të ishin në gjendje të ngrinin paratë për kompensimin e të besuarve.<br/><br/>Z. Beaumont tha se ata nuk donin vila, ata donin vila për njerëzit e varfër që po dëboheshin nga rrethi. Të tjerë thanë se nuk kishte para për të ndërtuar vila për të zëvendësuar vilat e sotshme, por vilat do të ishin një propozim ekonomik. Të tjerat raportuan se kishte shumë vila për t'u lënë në Highgate. Përmbajuni pyetjes së drurit.<br/><br/>Dr Fletcher tha thirrje në mesin e njerëzve që punojnë ishte se nuk kishte ku të shkonin. Njerëzit e punës erdhën tek ai me të qarat, "Ne jemi të dëbuar nga Highgate dhe janë të detyruar të shkojnë në Highgate New Town." Po të shitej frontazhi i rrugës “Muswell Hill” nuk kishte asnjë pyetje, por që rrugët mund të këputeshin nga pyjet në drejtim të Hornsey, por nëse Komisionerët nuk do të mund ta merrnin tokën nga Komisioni i Bamirësisë, nuk do të mund të shkëputnin rrugën.<br/><br/>Ai ishte shumë i sigurt se vilat mund të vihet në një gjendje të përshtatshme riparimi. Ai u pyet nga njerëzit e varfër, nga policia dhe nga një numër klasash pune për të përfaqësuar këto dy pika, që akomodimi i vilës ishte shumë i nevojshëm në Highgate dhe se nëse ata dikur lejonin tokën të shitej, nuk kishte të tregonte se ku do të qëndronte dora e ndërtuesit.<br/><br/>(Lodër dhe brohoritje të zgjatura).<br/><br/>Shumë njerëz të tjerë folën dhe Komisioneri përmblodhi duke thënë se ai e mori atë se opinioni mbizotërues ishte në favor të mbajtjes së vilave, por takimi nuk duhet të nxjerrë përfundime nga ajo që ai kishte thënë (Grans).<br/><br/>Të tjerë thanë se të besuarit e Bamirësisë kishin dështuar në detyrat e tyre duke i lënë vilat të bien në prishje.<br/><br/>Z. H.R. Williams, i Besuari që kishte shkruar në letër më parë, tha se e kishte atë mbi autoritetin më të mirë që Komisionerët e Kishës nuk do të bënin asnjë rrugë dhe nuk do të përfitoheshin nga veprimet e Komisionerëve të Bamirësisë. Të tjerët ishin shumë më pak të besuar dhe takimi u mbyll pas afro tre orësh.<br/><br/>'Ne jemi përballur me faktin se në Highgate dhe Muswell Hill ka një numër personash që duan drurin e poshtme të Kishës dhe nuk do të jenë të lumtur derisa ata të kenë marrë atë - ndërsa askush nuk duket i gatshëm për të shpenzuar një farthing për të paguar për të. Gjithkush thotë se do të ishte një gjë e mirë të kishte drurin si hapësirë të hapur, por të gjithë mendojnë se është detyra e dikujt tjetër për ta bërë atë një të tillë. Vestery Islington ka "zgjidhur" mbi këtë temë, por Islington Vestry nuk ofron një qindarkë copë drejt blerjes. --- Nuk ka problem më të vështirë për komunitetin ose individi për të zgjidhur sesa si të fitoni posedimin e pronës së njerëzve të tjerë pa paguar për të.'<br/><br/>Pagimi për të ishte me të vërtetë problemi si Druri i Kishës u bë subjekt i debatit intensiv lokal dhe kombëtar.Një komitet i përbashkët u formua për të mbledhur para për të shpëtuar drurin.Më 20 nëntor 1896, C.F. Kory-Wright, Hon Treasurer, i shkroi Standartit, një punim ditor në atë kohë duke kërkuar për ndihmë.Ai i kujtoi të gjithë rrezikun e humbjes së drurit dhe tha se mund të shpëtohej vetëm duke e blerë atë. Komisionerët e Kishës do të shisnin 25,000 £ dhe një shtesë (5.000 do të kërkohej për gardhe dhe kullim, duke bërë një total prej 30,000 £ Kjo ishte shumë për Këshillin Hornsey për të rritur, por ata tashmë kishin votuar £ 10,000 drejt totalit. Pyjet ishin me vlerë të pallogaritshme për të gjithë Londrën e Veriut, kështu që ai u bëri apel organeve publike dhe njerëzve privatë që të ngrenë 20,000 £ të mbetura. Ai paralajmëroi se oferta e tanishme nga Komisionerët e Kishës ishte e hapur vetëm në fund të vitit 1898. Pas kësaj në të do të lëviznin ndërtuesit.<br/><br/>Apeli u prit ngrohtësisht nga shtypi.Një projektligj privat u nxitua përmes Parlamentit dhe Akti i Ruajtjes së Drurit të Lartë, 1897, u bë ligj.Kontinete tani kishte të drejtë të reklamonte për kontribute për blerjen e Drurit dhe ruajtjen e tij.<br/><br/>Në një kohë mjaft të shkurtër pothuajse të gjitha paratë u rritën, por mijëra të fundit u treguan shumë të vështirë për t’u mbledhur dhe afati i Komisionerëve ishte çështje e disa javëve. Z. Cory-Wright shkroi duke u lutur për më shumë kohë, por iu dha vetëm tre muaj dhe pastaj vetëm nëse interes në 4 për qind u pagua për periudhën shtesë në shumën e plotë. Në fund, Këshilli i Qarkut të Londrës, i cili fillimisht kishte ofruar £ 2,500, e bëri këtë deri në 5,000 £ dhe totali u arrit, por ishte një gjë e drejtuar nga afër.<br/><br/>Këshilli vendosi ta riemërtojë Drurin si ‘Mallrat e Mbretëreshës’ për nder të Diamantit të Mbretëreshës Victoria Jubile dhe Hornsey vendosi një shfaqje të shkëlqyer të drekës kur Dukesha e Albany zyrtarisht e shpalli drurin të hapur 'për përdorim të lirë të publikut për gjithnjë e më shumë'.<br/><br/>Ndërsa fushata për të shpëtuar Churchyard Bottom Wood ishte drejtuar dhe drejtuar nga njerëz lokalë të cilët ndiheshin me pasion në lidhje me këtë copë druri, ata thirrën në ndihmën dhe përvojën e një rrjeti të madh të njerëzve, disa prej të cilëve kishin punuar së bashku në fushata të ngjashme për më shumë se tridhjetë vjet. Komiteti lëshoi një apel, të shtypur në letër me cilësi shumë të mirë dhe duke mbajtur disa emra të famshëm.<br/><br/>Pyetjet e hapësirës së hapur dhe shëndetit publik ishin subjekte kryesore të vizionit Viktorian.<br/><br/>Lëvizja për hapësira të hapura<br/><br/>Octavia Hill, reformuese e madhe e strehimit, e cila kishte filluar me tre shtëpi të vjetra në Marylebone, bleu për të nga Jolm Ruskin, ishte bërë shpejt një ekspert për strehimin e njerëzve të varfër në kushtet më të shëndetshme të mundshme. Rruga e saj ishte të blinte qira dhe më pas rrëzonte disa nga shtëpitë e mbushura me njerëz në mënyrë që të sillnin dritë e ajër në pjesën tjetër, duke besuar se ajri i pastër dhe rrezet e diellit ishin e vetmja mënyrë që njerëzit e varfër të mund të shpëtonin nga ethet ‘pastër. Ajo e kishte mësuar këtë si fëmijë nga gjyshi i saj, Southwood Smith, që zhvilloi teoritë e tij në Ethe Hospital në Kryqin e Mbretit.<br/><br/>Ai kishte ndërtuar Banesat e para industriale për njerëzit e varfër dhe kishte provuar statistikisht se ajri i mirë dhe kullimi i mirë është shpëtimi i jetës.Giv Gardens, në rrugën Northworld, është një rezultat i drejtpërdrejtë i ideve të Southwood Smith.<br/><br/>Rëndësia e ajrit të hapur<br/><br/>Hapësirat e hapura dhe mundësia për të marrë ajër të pastër, ishin thelbësore për njerëzit që jetojnë në një ose dy dhoma të mbushura me njerëz.Octavia Hill i mori akuzat e saj nga lagjet e varfra të Lisson Grove, deri në Avenue të Fitzjohn në Hampstead Heath. Ajo e donte kaq shumë fushat e Fitzhonit që ajo u përpoq t'i blinte ato si një park publik. Ata duhej të kushtonin 10.000 £ dhe brenda tre javëve gusht ishin rritur 8,500 £. Duhej vetëm fundi i festave verore dhe kthimi nga pushimet e miqve simpatikë dhe rreth 1,500 £ të tjera do të rriteshin, por pronarët papritur tërhoqën ofertën e tyre.Përkundër gjithë kërkesave, fushat u mbuluan me shtëpi të mëdha.<br/><br/>Nga kjo zhvilloi fushatën për të shpëtuar Parlament Hill, hapësira tjetër e hapur në veri nga Lisson Grove, duke blerë fusha në rrugën e ndërtuesve për të bërë një sainatrale të përhershme të kordonit kundër tullave avancimin. Fushata “Parlamenti Hill Fields” ishte kaq e suksesshme, sa që ishte kaluar fatura e Hampstead Health dhe kishte pará nga apeli. Nga këto para dhe shtysa drejt hapësirave të hapura, ishte zhvillimi i Besimit Kombëtar. Oktavia Hill kishte qenë e interesuar në mbrojtjen e zonave si Church Bottom Wood për vite, kështu që ajo ishte një aleat i natyrshëm në luftën për të shpëtuar drurin.<br/><br/>Shoqëria e Ruajtjes së Përbashkët gjithashtu, ishte e njohur me këtë lloj agjitacioni dhe grumbullimi të parave. Kishin rënë nga gardhet kur zotëritë e manorisë kishin mbyllur pjesët e tokës së përbashkët, duke çuar në betejat ligjore dhe të paligjshme kundër privatizimit arrogant të tokës tradicionalisht të lirë. Robert Hunter, avokati i tyre i Nderit nga viti 1868, ishte gjithmonë i shqetësuar për sigurimin e hapësirave të hapura, të mëdha apo të vogla, për publikun.Ai tani Sir Robert Hunter, u bë Kryetar i Kishës Bottom Apale. Kryetari i Shoqatës së Ruajtjes së Përbashkët ishte Z. Shaw-Lefevre MP (më vonë Zoti Everley) i cili luajti një rol të madh në këtë dhe fushata të tjera në Shtëpinë e Përbashkët. Octavia Hill ishte përfshirë në punën e tyre nga rreth 1875.<br/><br/>Në të njëjtën kohë, Octavia Hill po bënte fushatë për një Bill Burials.<br/><br/>Kishat e qytetit ishin bërë kaq të plota dhe një rrezik i tillë serioz për shëndetin, duke ndotur puse nga të cilat njerëzit tërhiqnin ujin e tyre të pijshëm, saqë varrimet e qytetit nuk lejohej më.Në vend të kësaj, në periferi të qytetit krijoheshin varre. Më pas, në skajet e varrezave të vjetra të qytetit ka qenë lëvizja për t’i nxjerrë përsëri trupat diku tjetër dhe për t’i kthyer në kopshte e hapësira të hapura, në vend që të ngrihej mbi to. Ky vend në qendër të Londrës ishte shumë i vlefshëm dhe spekulatorët ishin të zjarrtë për të marrë atë: Edhe Kuakët kishin ndërtuar mbi një nga varrezat e tyre dhe kishin kërcënuar ta bënin përsëri këtë duke ndërtuar mbi fushat Bunhill. Oktavia Hill kishte një rrjet të aleatëve në një duzinë fusha, kështu që ndihma e saj për të shpëtuar druri Fund të Kishës duhet të ketë qenë e paçmueshme.<br/><br/>Shoqata e Kopshteve Metropolitane, e ngritur në vitin 1882, kishte hedhur rreth dyqind kopshte të vogla në qendrat e qytetit deri në vitin 1890. Ata më vonë i dorëzuan ato pranë autoriteteve lokale, kështu që mbështetja e tyre për Apelimin e Drurit të Kishës u sigurua që në fillim.<br/><br/>Shoqëria Kyle tani harrohet, por në ditën e saj pati ndikim të madh në planifikimin e qytetit dhe legjislacionin në hapësirën e hapur. Shoqëria ishte ngritur rreth vitit 1875 për ‘Difuzionin e së Bukurës’, për të sjellë ngjyrat dhe interesin për jetët e njerëzve që jetojnë në mjedise të shurdhër, me ngjyra të ndritshme në mure dhe dekor, në mjedise të mira, në natyrë, në letërsi e në art. Të gjitha këto ranë brenda në qëndrimin e shoqërisë. Kishte një Degë Dekorative, për të cilën ligjëroi William Morris; një Degë Muzikore për të promovuar koret dhe Mbrëmjet e lumtura për njerëzit në ndërtesat e shkollave lokale dhe një Degë Letërsie. Shoqëria apeloi rregullisht me letra në The Times, në 'klasa më të pasura' për libra dhe periodikë për t'u shpërndarë në klubet e djemve dhe vajzave, almhouses dhe gjetkë.Megjithatë, Komiteti i Hapët i Hapësirave ishte më aktivi. Emri shumë i quajtur ‘Kyrle’ erdhi nga Papa Njeriu i Rossit, filantropi që i dha vendlindjen e tij popullit si një park publik. |
| With Thanksgiving around the corner, here are some festive file folder games we made for the girls. Both Thanksgiving games focus on math skills. And I'm grateful once again to my husband, Ed, for making all the clipart for me.<br/><br/>Thanksgiving Pattern Making<br/><br/>Like the name says, this game is about making patterns. Little ones just learning about patterns, can simply match the pictures onto the pattern strips, while others can continue the pattern with the picture cards on the blank strips.<br/><br/>To make the file folder, you want to cut out the grid of pictures to make the card pieces. I recommend laminating them to help them last longer. Then glue the pattern strips down on the file folder.<br/><br/>I wanted to have the blank pattern strips too so that the girls could see where to continue the pattern and how many to lay out. I attached them to the side of the folder using tape so that they could fold in to pack up the game and extend to layout the pattern.<br/><br/>I also added an extra blank one so that the girls could make their own pattern as well.<br/><br/>Turkey Number Game<br/><br/>In this game the girls add the feathers to the turkey body while practicing counting and number recognition. I used the colorless feathers to act as a guide for where to add the feathers and so that the girls could match the numbers. And be sure when gluing down the turkey body you only glue in the center so that the wing pieces can slide under the body.<br/><br/>Once all the feathers are laid out, we practice some simple arithmetic, such as taking away three feathers and seeing how many are left then adding two back to see what it equals.<br/><br/>In addition to black and white wings, we also included a colorless turkey in case you want to have the little ones color their own set. Instead of a file folder game you can turn this into a craft, coloring the pieces, cutting them out, and gluing them together.<br/><br/>Another option is to use the pieces to make a felt board story. We sometimes sing a turkey version of 10 Little Indians:<br/><br/>Like this:<br/><br/>Who Am I?<br/><br/>I think this is where I'm suppose to say something witty about myself. Oh well. I'm a stay-at-home mom to three awesome kids--our twin daughters who are seven now and a two-year-old son who is full of energy. In my pre-children life I was a teacher and I now homeschool our children. I'm also married to Ed, who is currently serving in the Air Force, and is the love of my life (it'd be awkward if he wasn't). Our family is big on books, crafts, and having fun together. I just thought I would share our activities in my own little corner of the internet.<br/><br/>Zoe appears to have it all--rich, handsome husband, easy New York life--but she made mistakes in her past and those mistakes are coming back up in her new life. I found myself on the edge of my seat for most of the book and was surprised...<br/><br/>I loved this book, I love the story, and I am grateful Margot Shetterly brought it to light. My only complaint was that I wished she discussed Katherine Johnson's role in the later missions a bit more but I guess the story had to end som...<br/><br/>I wanted to like this book and I did throughout most of it. Dana finds out her estranged husband and his girlfriend are found dead in the New Mexico desert. I was immediately drawn in by her character and the story.

| Alcohol use by persons under age 21 has been identified as a major public health problem. Studies note that it increases the risks for disability, and may be detrimental to the developing brain. Minors who drink are more likely to commit suicide, break the law, or be victims of violence. Alcohol is implicated in nearly one-third of youth traffic fatalities. The total annual cost of underage drinking is estimated at $62 billion. While most laws intended to prevent underage drinking are passed at the state level, there has been legislative activity and interest at the federal level to support states' efforts to curb the problem. This report describes the extent of underage alcohol use, recent legislative activity on this issue, and various policy implications. It will be updated as new data become available. | Përdorimi i alkoolit nga personat nën 21 vjeç është identifikuar si një problem i madh i shëndetit publik. Studimet vërejnë se ai rrit rreziqet për paaftësinë dhe mund të jetë i dëmshëm për trurin në zhvillim. Personat e mitur që pijnë kanë më shumë gjasa të kryejnë vetëvrasje, të thyejnë ligjin, ose të jenë viktima të dhunës. Alkooli përfshihet në gati një e treta e vdekjeve të trafikut rinor.Kosto totale vjetore e pirjes së të miturve vlerësohet në 62 miliardë dollarë. Ndërsa shumica e ligjeve që synojnë të parandalojnë pirjen e të miturve kalojnë në nivelin shtetëror, ka pasur aktivitet legjislativ dhe interes në nivelin federal për të mbështetur përpjekjet e shteteve për të frenuar problemin. Ky raport përshkruan shkallën e përdorimit të alkoolit në moshë të mitur, aktivitetin e fundit legjislativ mbi këtë çështje dhe implikime të ndryshme të politikës.Do të përditësohet ndërsa të dhënat e reja bëhen të disponueshme. |
| Tag Archives: real food<br/><br/>Last week I wrote about the Nordic Food Manifesto, and how Denmark created a strong "real food" culture largely from an intentional effort led by Claus Meyer. It wasn't political lobbying or public petitioning that resulted in food reform, but rather a grassroots effort led by citizens with the power to actually implement and follow-through with change.<br/><br/>I ended the post alluding to one question: Why is it so hard for us to do this ourselves, as individuals? If an entire country can implement and spread a common view towards food, why can't we?<br/><br/>There's nothing really stopping us from mimicking Denmark's success. The problem is, we're inundated with so many messages about what we should be eating, and how we should be living, it's hard to know where to start. So rather than following successful frameworks that have been shown to work (like the Nordic Food Manifesto), most people jump from diet craze to diet craze, trying to find the "right way to eat."<br/><br/>But how did Claus Meyer succeed? What was the secret sauce that helped the Manifesto take hold? And is it reasonable to think we can apply those lessons to our own lives?

Nuk ishte lobimi politik apo peticioni publik që rezultoi në reformën e ushqimit, por një përpjekje bazë e udhëhequr nga qytetarët me fuqinë për të zbatuar dhe ndjekur realisht me ndryshime.<br/><br/>Përfundova postimin duke aluduar në një pyetje: Pse është kaq e vështirë për ne që ta bëjmë këtë, si individë?Nëse një vend i tërë mund të zbatojë dhe përhapë një pamje të përbashkët drejt ushqimit, pse nuk mundemi?<br/><br/>Nuk ka asgjë që na ndalon vërtet të imitojmë suksesin e Danimarkës., Problemi është, ne jemi të mahnitur me kaq shumë mesazhe për atë që duhet të hamë dhe si duhet të jetojmë, është e vështirë të dimë se ku të fillojmë.
