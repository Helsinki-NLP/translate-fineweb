| Bacopa<br/><br/>19 Nov 2015<br/>Posted by Doxiderol<br/><br/>Bacopa is a perennial plant that thrives in marshy subtropical and tropical regions around the globe. The highly regarded herb is a key ingredient in Doxiderol, a nutritional supplement that enhances cognitive function. Bacopa was chosen for its ability to protect the brain and increase acetylcholine, a biochemical messenger that enables the nervous system to relay information.<br/><br/>Ayurvedic practitioners first described the therapeutic properties of bacopa in 300 BC. The physicians recorded bacopa's abilities to enhance intelligence and memory. Nearly 2,500 years later, a growing body of modern research confirms the cognitive benefits of bacopa recorded in the Ayurvedic text.<br/><br/>In 1987, researchers in India evaluated the effects of bacopa on the intellectual function of school-aged children. During the four-week study, they administered bacopa to 40 children who were 6 to 8 years old. The scientists determined that bacopa increased perception and memory. The children were able to solve maze exercises quicker and more accurately after receiving bacopa. Many parents in India routinely use bacopa to enhance their children's intellectual development.<br/><br/>A 12-week study published in the August 2001 issue of Psychopharmacology investigated the effects of bacopa on cognitive function. Scientists randomly assigned the healthy volunteers, aged 18 to 65, to receive bacopa or an inactive substance. They also used a double-blind configuration for the study to conceal the identities of the products. Researchers use this design to ensure that the test results are valid because it eliminates bias by the researchers and participants. The bacopa group experienced a significant improvement in the speed at which they were able to process visual information. The participants also learned faster and stored new memories more efficiently.<br/><br/>In 2007, a Texas A&M College of Medicine laboratory study revealed one of the mechanisms responsible for bacopa's ability to promote brain health. According to the scientists, bacopa uses polyphenols to prevent oxidative stress and the damage that it causes to healthy brain cells. Bacopa also reduces harmful deposits of a substance known as beta-amyloid, which is the primary component of the plaque in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease.<br/><br/>A double-blind study published in the July 2008 issue of the Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine evaluated the effect of bacopa on elderly patients. The study confirmed that bacopa increased cognitive performance while reducing stress. According to the authors, the benefits achieved in this study confirmed the results of earlier research.<br/><br/>A 90-day study published in the December 2008 issue of Phytotherapy Research confirms the cognitive benefits that were previously demonstrated in other bacopa studies. Bacopa significantly improved the ability of the participants to temporarily store and use information required for completing a complex task. The double-blind study also demonstrated that bacopa reduced the time required to process visual information.<br/><br/>In addition to enhancing nerve signal transmission, the scientists theorize that bacopa increases cognitive function by reducing anxiety. Numerous studies indicate that anxiety interferes with the ability to perform tasks that require higher-level cognitive functions, such as learning and memorization. Stress disrupts biochemical messengers and healthy nerve signal transmission. Bacopa alleviates stress and restores a sense of calm by increasing acetylcholine levels, which reduces your heart rate and enables you to take deeper breaths.<br/><br/>Doxiderol is a great way to obtain the benefits of bacopa. This holistic supplement also contains other natural ingredients that promote brain health and support your ability to focus and concentrate on complex task as well as memorize information. | Bacopa<br/><br/>18 gadīgas<br/>Rakstīja Doxicrol<br/><br/>Bacopa ir daudzgadīgs augs, kas plaukst purvainos subtropu un tropu reģionos visā pasaulē. Augsti vērtētais augs ir galvenā sastāvdaļa Doxicrol, uztura bagātinātājs, kas uzlabo kognitīvo funkciju. Bacopa tika izvēlēts par tās spēju aizsargāt smadzenes, kā arī palielināt acetilholīna, bioķīmisko kurjers, kas ļauj nervu sistēmu, lai pārraidītu informāciju.<br/><br/>Ājurvēdas praktiķi vispirms aprakstīja bacopa terapeitiskās īpašības 300. gadā pirms mūsu ēras. Ārsti reģistrēja bacopa spējas uzlabot inteliģenci un atmiņu. Gandrīz 2500 gadus vēlāk, arvien vairāk mūsdienu pētījumu apstiprina bacopa kognitīvās priekšrocības, kas ierakstītas Ājurvēdas tekstā.<br/><br/>1987. gadā pētnieki Indijā novērtēja bacopa ietekmi uz skolas vecuma bērnu intelektuālo funkciju. Četru nedēļu pētījuma laikā viņi ievadīja bacopa 40 bērniem, kas bija 6 līdz 8 gadus veci. Zinātnieki konstatēja, ka bacopa palielināja uztveri un atmiņu. Bērni varēja atrisināt labirints vingrinājumus ātrāk un precīzāk pēc saņemšanas bacopa. Daudzi vecāki Indijā regulāri izmanto bacopa, lai uzlabotu savu bērnu intelektuālo attīstību.<br/><br/>12 nedēļu pētījums publicēts augustā 2001 jautājumu par psihofarmakoloģijas pētīta ietekme bacopa uz kognitīvo funkciju. Zinātnieki nejauši piešķirts veseliem brīvprātīgajiem, vecumā no 18 līdz 65, saņemt bacopa vai neaktīvu vielu. Viņi arī izmantoja dubultaklu konfigurāciju pētījumam, lai slēptu produktu identitāti. Pētnieki izmanto šo dizainu, lai nodrošinātu, ka testa rezultāti ir derīgi, jo tas novērš pētnieku un dalībnieku aizspriedumus. Bacopa grupa ievērojami uzlaboja ātrumu, kādā viņi varēja apstrādāt vizuālo informāciju. Dalībnieki arī ātrāk apguva un efektīvāk saglabāja jaunas atmiņas.<br/><br/>2007. gadā Texas A & M College of Medicine laboratorijas pētījums atklāja vienu no mehānismiem, kas atbild par bacopa spēju veicināt smadzeņu veselību. Pēc zinātnieku domām, bacopa izmanto polifenolus, lai novērstu oksidatīvo stresu un kaitējumu, ko tas izraisa veselām smadzeņu šūnām. Bacopa arī samazina kaitīgas vielas, kas pazīstama kā beta-amiloīds, nogulsnēšanos, kas ir galvenā smadzeņu plātnītes sastāvdaļa pacientiem ar Alcheimera slimību.<br/><br/>Dubultmaskēts pētījums, kas publicēts 2008 jūlija izdevumā Journal of Alternative un Complementary Medicine, novērtēja bacopa ietekmi uz gados vecākiem pacientiem. Pētījums apstiprināja, ka bacopa palielināja kognitīvo sniegumu, vienlaikus samazinot stresu. Pēc autoru domām, šajā pētījumā sasniegtie ieguvumi apstiprināja agrāko pētījumu rezultātus.<br/><br/>90 dienu pētījums, kas publicēts Phytotherapy Research 2008. gada decembra numurā, apstiprina kognitīvos ieguvumus, kas iepriekš tika pierādīti citos bacopa pētījumos. Bacopa ievērojami uzlaboja dalībnieku spēju īslaicīgi uzglabāt un izmantot sarežģītu uzdevumu. Dubultakls pētījums arī parādīja, ka bacopa samazināja laiku, kas nepieciešams, lai apstrādātu vizuālo informāciju.<br/><br/>Papildus uzlabojot nervu signālu pārraidi, zinātnieki teoretizē, ka bacopa palielina kognitīvo funkciju, samazinot trauksmi. Daudzi pētījumi liecina, ka trauksme traucē spēju veikt uzdevumus, kas prasa augstāka līmeņa kognitīvās funkcijas, piemēram, mācīšanos un iegaumēšanu. Stress traucē bioķīmiskos kurjerus un veselīgu nervu signālu pārraidi. Bacopa mazina stresu un atjauno sajūtu mieru, palielinot acetilholīna līmeni, kas samazina jūsu sirdsdarbību un ļauj veikt dziļāku breaths.<br/><br/>Doxicrol ir lielisks veids, kā iegūt bacopa priekšrocības. Šis visaptverošais papildinājums satur arī citas dabiskas sastāvdaļas, kas veicina smadzeņu veselību un atbalsta jūsu spēju koncentrēties un koncentrēties uz sarežģītu uzdevumu, kā arī iegaumēt informāciju. |

She can also sense demonic auras as well as evil auras. When she was born and growing, however, her powers were sealed and she was much less powerful. Since the defeat of the one sealing her powers, Kagome has reached her full potential.<br/><br/>PURIFICATION By making a physical connection, Kagome has the ability to purify both poison and darkness from a subject (living and inanimate). To do so, she projects her spiritual powers through her hand.<br/><br/>SPIRITUAL BARRIERS With her full potential, Kagome has the ability to create a barrier around herself and expand it around others. It is a dome-shaped barrier that can destroy weak demons that make contact with the barrier.<br/><br/>IMPROVED EYESIGHT<br/>Kagome has the ability to see things that are often invisible to the human eye: ghosts, spirits, divine and evil auras.<br/><br/>ABILITIES WITH WEAPONS<br/>Kagome has the ability to use a bow and arrow. She has been self trained, and after years of practice, her arrow rarely misses its mark. Alongside this, Kagome has the ability to infuse her arrows with powers. She can infuse an arrows with her spiritual powers which allows them to penetrate demonic forces, destroy spells, and purify objects. She can infuse her bow with her powers and deflect enemy attacks. She has the ability to infuse her arrows with purifying energy to purify poison as well as powerful, long distant demonic attacks. And, finally, she has the ability to bypass others with her arrow: If her target happens to be behind a barrier or a hostage, the arrow can teleport and hit only her target<br/><br/>The rest of her abilities have become rather unimportant as they are related to time travel (through the Bone Eater's Well), the Shikon Jewel, or her previous incarnation.<br/><br/>the canon<br/><br/>Kagome has been pulled a few days after her high school graduation, however, before the Bone Eater's Well has opened again to allow her to return to the past permanently.<br/><br/>freestyle<br/><br/>memories<br/><br/>かごめ<br/><br/>The sound of her name was a soft whisper in the back of her mind, like a call muffled by the wind. It was the sound of a distant memory, a voice that she had started to forget but desperately clung to all the same. It was her mother's voice, twisted in the sorrow of her lost daughter. Afterall, Kagome banished without a trace. She vividly remembered those moments, the way the day had begun, what she had for breakfast and the last thing she had said to her mother. It was haunting, those memories, because it was like any other time she had slipped between worlds. She had woken, listless, because she had no purpose outside of school. She could find a job, and was scheduled for an interview that day. Her heart hadn't been in it, but it was what she needed to do.<br/><br/>She remembered the feeling of dread, sucking it up and giving herself a pep talk that she could do this. That she could progress in the life that she was meant to now that things had been settled in the past. Of course, she had the lingering feeling that she no longer belonged in her own time or her own life. Not with everything that she had left behind.<br/><br/>Kagome remembered the feeling of the wood beneath her fingers, the way her hand had curled into the handle to slide the door open. She remembered that she paused, turning to her mother with a bright and vibrant smile as she shook herself from her stupor. "I'm taking off." She remembered how strong her voice sounded, the smile on her mother's lips as her eyes shone with pride. Her mother bade her farewell, which didn't seem any different than before but somehow the weight of the words settled in heavier on Kagome's shoulders the more she reflected.<br/><br/>Briefly, the thoughts flickered forward, wondering if her mother worried over her, missed her like she did. Kagome could openly admit that her mother's strength, her support for the fact that her daughter slipped through time so frequently. There were times when she thought herself weak for not having the woman to lean on.<br/><br/>However, she remembered that she did muster up a meager amount of strength.She could remember the shift in the air, the temperature notably different than what she had expected, blinking at the sudden and unfamiliar surroundings. It was not her family's shrine. And when she turned to go back, to slip through the door she had come through, she was met with unfamiliar and cold metal beneath her fingertips and an interior that was not the entrance of her house. A man stood before her, behind a counter, who stared at her with eyes as wide as her own.<br/><br/>She didn't panic, at least. Being torn through time and placed in impossible situations at least built your willpower as far as strange happenings went. Because it wasn't every day that someone found themselves dragged into the past by a demon, intent on ripping a powerful jewel from their body that they didn't even know was there. And then there was the fact that she had shattered said powerful jewel into who knows how many pieces and was tasked on finding them. Such things were not normal, and she had needed to square up and roll with it once she realized that was her reality. It had seemed so simple, just gather the shards and fix the jewel.<br/><br/>But it hadn't been easy, there were many demons after the shards and the jewel itself. And one particularly powerful demon with a wish that he was determined to see fulfilled. To this day, she had never learned his wish but knew it had never been granted even once he had the blasted thing completed. He had ruined so many lives for the sake of nothing. Ruined so many lives for such a futile task. Naraku had been the most difficult foe, and the one who had been the center of everything that had gone wrong in all of her friend's lives.<br/><br/>But, it was that unpredicability, that necessity to roll with what was happening and the willpower that she had gained from her adventure that she remembered drawing upon to come up with a story that fit in the moment that didn't seem too whimsical or far fetched. She needed to be believed, she needed to survive.<br/><br/>Afterall, she faced worse than a man in a camera store. She had lied through her teeth to save her life before.<br/><br/>"I was looking for a job." In the end, it wasn't a complete lie. After all, she had set out of her house with the intent of attending a job interview. Her state of dress would at least attest to that much. It was one of the easier fibs she had ever told.<br/><br/>And, for some reason, that crazy man hired her.<br/><br/>かごめ<br/><br/>Kagomed rolled over in her bed as she pushed back the distant memories, refusing to acknowledge that she was really awake. She clawed at the last glimpses of sleep, begging it to return and to take her back into its embrace. She closed her eyes, willing sleep to come and was only met with memories. The echoes of a song sang in the distance of her memories, a song that had often tormented her, given the same name as her. The voice that sang was no longer reminiscent of her mother, but the voices of children who she had often played with growing up. They called back the memories, even though it had been years since she started this live, even though she was happy in this life, the call of these memories was too loud.<br/><br/>Suddenly, she was falling back into them and sleep evaded her again. She was watching herself in her family's embrace while Inuyasha was pulled back into the well, looking as startled as she had felt. The memories of that moment, those feelings, were still so strong. The feeling of heartbreak and sorrow welled up again though it had been so long since she had felt like she had been ripped away from everything that mattered to her.<br/><br/>Of course her family mattered, and she was happy to be in their arms again. She could never fully, truly describe how she had felt in those days. She still couldn't explain the way she felt split in two, with warring desires to be in both her past and present. She remembered the futile attempts to jump through the well, fingers clawing at the ground in a desperate plea to let her return. The first month home, she didn't sleep so much as she cried.<br/><br/>Elysion had garnished a similar reaction, though it was not so fierce because she didn't know exactly where she had slipped through nor did she know where she could worm her way back. Her explorations were subtle between working her job and trying to settle herself into this life. She had no intentions of staying, no intentions of lingering longer than she needed. And while she didn't try as fiercely as she had when she tried to return to the past, her passion was tenfold because she had no ties to this world. Because she was truly alone… With no hope of anyone to reach her.<br/><br/>In her irrational moments, she thought the Jewel had pulled her back and found a new hell for her to reside in. A new hell that would force her to make a wish, but she remembered very clearly that she had wished it gone forever. That didn't stop her dreams, the times when she woke up in the night sobbing. And those memories of her past were the hardest to deal with, the hardest to forget. Her heart began to race in a panic as she turned in her bed again, her breath became a struggle as she fought against a panic attack induced by her wandering mind this late into the night.<br/><br/>She hated feeling so weak, so afraid.<br/><br/>籠の中の鳥は<br/><br/>Kagome finally pulled herself from bed, her room lit with a pale light that was enough to guide her to the bathroom. She stood before the mirror, the sink running while she stared at her reflection. Raven colored hair covered her face and she felt as bad as she looked. Her first morning in Elysion was similar to this, only she was in worse shape.<br/><br/>She had found a place to sleep, managing to work out a deal with the owner of the building to allow her to stay a small period of time without paying. Perhaps it had been Miroku's influence that allowed her to strike such deals, as the monk was known for his way in charming (or scamming) people into giving them more than enough for the work they had done. The monk had always been that way, since they had first met. He would claim the dwelling of a lord to be haunted when it was not or, claim that they were subject to an attack when they would not be. He would sell his wards and charms for such high prices. It worked practically every time and she wondered why people had been so willing to trust him.<br/><br/>Perhaps it was his smile, or the fact that he was a monk that the people of the past were so willing to crumble. He never preyed on the weak, at least. He always did what was right and he was a symbol of strength to her at times when he would push through everything in order to do what was right. He pushed through the fact that he was dying, that he was cursed, and tried to do something about it rather than wallowing in his fate. He had pushed himself to the limit in the time leading up to their final fight. And she had been glad that they had defeated Naraku before he could become subject to the same fate as his father, and his father before him.<br/><br/>As far as her own charms went, however, she was more fair than her friend and made the deal reasonable. She doubted that anyone in this world would pay a hefty price for an exorcism or banishing demons. They were too technologically advanced for that. But she was clever enough, and smart enough, to make a good deal.<br/><br/>But now, Kagome was in a better place though the look on her face looked the same. Haunted, tired, drained...<br/><br/>A quick glance at a clock on the wall told her that she could try to sleep longer. But she opted out of that, not wanting to face the flashbacks again. She took a shower instead, using the cold water to chase away her demons, to fill her lungs with a sharp intake of breath and force herself awake.<br/><br/>いついつ出やる<br/><br/>It didn't work.<br/><br/>Not in the way she was wanting. The cold water certainly forced the air into her lungs, forced her mind to wake and muscles to seize. A bitter laugh was pulled from her lips as she tilted her head back and found herself remembering more. Today, she wasn't going to escape them so easily. She wasn't going to recover so simply, to recover just because she willed it.<br/><br/>Sometimes, there's no avoiding the thoughts you wanted to. Even when you were certain that you were past them.<br/><br/>Sango would have been a great help in this situation. The demon slayer was her best friend, she would even go as far as to call her the sister that she never had. An older sister who was wise, always had her side when trouble arose. Particularly boy trouble, when such things were rather trivial but it was fun to have a crush and for her friend to be mad on her behalf when Inuyasha made her sad. After all, it had been often that the half-demon would run to his dead lover's side and break her heart more than once.<br/><br/>But, Sango also inspired her in other ways. After all the woman had faced, she had always been so strong, so sure... Even in the times that she had doubted herself, she always pulled through. She admired that she had the ability to survive after losing her whole family -- the reminder of this often pushed Kagome to survive, because she lost everyone to this world -- and then having her brother become a pawn of Naraku. It wasn't easy, couldn't have been something to that just anyone could face and still go forward with. She still smiled, even with that pain and those reminders... She was often so bright, even in the darker times.<br/><br/>And right now, she wanted to lean into the older woman's side, to take comfort in the fact that she was there and she was supportive. She felt that Sango would somehow pull through this, and offer some words of strength and understanding. It was times like these that made these spells worse, the constant reminder that she was without her family.<br/><br/>"I don't want to be alone." She cried aloud in her solitude, the sound of the shower drowning out the plea.<br/><br/>She wasn't afraid to admit it.<br/><br/>夜明けの晩に<br/><br/>Another hour had slipped by before she had realized it. Her skin was cold from the water and it felt like ice ran through her veins. She hadn't realized she had begun to shiver until her hand reached to turn off the water and end her shower. Kagome didn't seek her own gaze in the mirror again, instead, she wrapped herself in towels and trudged out of the bathroom, up the stairs and into her kitchen. She started on making a light breakfast, idly reading through her notes for the day as the food cooked.<br/><br/>Her career was really taking off these last years. Her photos were featured in many galleries, her name started to frequent many lips for those who were interested in photography.<br/><br/>The job she had asked for on a whim had sparked it all. She had been far more lucky than she had expected to be in this world. Never lucky enough to slip back through the cracks into her own world, but lucky enough to do well. As she turned back to the stove, she remembered the time she had finally given up on returning home. It was about two years into her life here, as she had started to venture into photography as more than just a hobby but something she could make a name for herself with.<br/><br/>That day had been particularly pleasant, the sun was high in the sky and she had found herself taking some photos of the natural scenery. A little boy had hidden in one of the plants, and she had caught a picture of the moment his face had settled into a cheerful, mischievous grin the moment before he had jumped out to startle his prey. It reminded her of Shippou, the little kitsune she had, essentially, adopted. He, too, had been torn from his family when they had first met. His father killed and he was determined to avenge him. While young, he did seem so mature in their first encounters.<br/><br/>Maybe it had been the influence of Inuyasha that allowed the kit to act like a kid again, to be young and whimsical at times while others he was more mature. He offered comfort to her in his own way, and she tried to care for him as she would her own though she had been so young then as well. However, her youth did not stop her from understanding how to tend to him or care for him like her child. Her heart swelled when he smiled, when he had been so happy for his gift of crayons and took the time to make art. She was so proud of each drawing that he had finished that she knew that this was how a mother would feel in such a situation.<br/><br/>The pain that had ripped through her was too much, too sudden. She missed him and wanted to see how much he had grown since she had been gone. She had missed so much...<br/><br/>To spare herself any further pain, any false hopes… She gave up. And focused on bettering herself.<br/><br/>鶴と亀が<br/><br/>Breakfast tasted bland, boring, and inspired. Only after she had finished did she realized she had forgotten to any sort of spices or flavor to the food. It was too late now to remember that much, as her mind was too busy remembering other details of her life that clearly had become more important than her food.<br/><br/>"Sit!"<br/><br/>Of course, nothing happened when she had angrily yelled at one particularly frustrating client that reminded her of the half-demon. He was being particularly stubborn and rude, wanting a photo taken his way rather than letting it work out naturally. You could try to force wild animals to behave how you wanted. But, rarely did anyone succeed with force. Inuyasha wasn't as bad, however. Inuyasha had learned before she had been forced away from him. He had become gentler, more understanding, more mature though there were times he was still childish and cocky.<br/><br/>She remember how red her cheeks had burned, but how she stood her ground and fired him. She told him she refused to work for anyone or with anyone who wanted to twist something beyond it's nature, beyond it's own desires.<br/><br/>She should have compared the man to Naraku rather than Inuyasha. Though her client did not have such extreme intentions. At least the feeling afterwards was a pleasant memory. The freedom of knowing that she had come so far that she could refuse work that she didn't want to do, to be her own person that was independent of others. She could say that she made it at that point. Even though she heard rumors days later with words meant to slander her.<br/><br/>She defended herself righteously, like she did towards the end of her journey. After all, she was the only one who could protect herself in this world.<br/><br/>滑った<br/><br/>Morning light began to creep into her home, reminding her again of the passage of time. Again, she considered the list of things she had to do and debated on where to start. Or, if she should even start at all. With how the day began, she didn't know if she could consider that a great idea. It was doubtful that she would be successful with how lost in herself she was becoming.<br/><br/>She didn't want to mess up her latest work. Because she had done that on a few occasions before. It wasn't pleasant to try and recover from a complete disaster.<br/><br/>Kagome remembered the feeling of her expensive, brand new, camera slipping from her hands. She wasn't prepared to support it, because she had just removed it from her bag. Part of her screamed on the inside. A dramatic, over-the-top, full on scream that she frequently did when she was much, much younger. When she was struggling to make it through middle school while hopping between times. The other part of her had remained frozen in place while her lense completely shattered and the rest of the camera had broken along with it.<br/><br/>Seeing Inuyasha's brother, a full demon, standing before her was the last thing she expected when she had made her way out for her photos. He stood as proud as ever, as tall as ever, as imposing as she remembered. He didn't look fazed at all to be in an entirely different world, though she was never the best at reading his mind. His name on her lips was so potent, that she could remember the tiniest feelings as she did. Her lips were chapped, her mouth felt dry, and the bubbling feeling of anxiety in her stomach made her feel sick.<br/><br/>She didn't want her hopes to be up.<br/><br/>But, she wanted him to be there, even if they were not friends. They were allies, if anything, since they had fought side by side. And something was better than absolutely nothing.<br/><br/>And Kagome had the sense enough not to throw herself at him, to wrap her arms around him in relief that knowing she was not alone. Her camera no longer mattered when she approached him. She remembered that nothing else mattered for days as she spent time with him, not speaking of their world but speaking (or, she was speaking and he simply acknowledged that fact).<br/><br/>When, exactly, she fell for him though… Kagome couldn't recall. It was a subtle thing, just like he was. But she knew the feeling was there. And he let her know that she was not alone in the fact that she had fallen, that feelings had somehow blossomed.<br/><br/>後ろの正面<br/><br/>A feeling of weightlessness overtook her and suddenly her eyes opened while her mind desperately clawed for the last thing she was doing. She didn't recall when she had fallen asleep on her couch, but she knew the last place she had been was on the far too comfortable cushions. She didn't struggle, however, or fight the weightlessness as she was in familiar arms. Her head tilted against Sesshoumaru's chest, taking comfort in the fact that he was here and she wasn't alone.<br/><br/>"Welcome back." His response was a soft hum in acknowledgement. He didn't need to speak much for her to understand his intent, or the rest of what he had to say.<br/><br/>He carried her back to her bed, settled her into it with ease. Her eyes met his and she smiled easily because no more memories drifted back, no more recollections teased at her. No, whenever he was near, she never fell back into those thoughts. He had helped, and the years had helped. Today was just… One of those days.<br/><br/>"Sleep." He commanded with ease, her eyes rolled at him but she did not fight because she was tired. Her hand clung tightly to him, while she felt his opposite hand press to her forehead in assessment of her wellbeing.<br/><br/>"I'm okay," she said, her words firm with her promise.<br/><br/>She was okay. She was alive. And she was happy.<br/><br/>だあれ<br/><br/>shipper<br/><br/>summary<br/><br/>Kagome, at one point in her life, was a rather regular teenage girl until she was attacked by a demon inside her family's well house. The demon dragged her down into the well, which magically transported her about 500 years into the past. There, she learned that a sacred jewel was encased inside her body as she was the reincarnation of a priestess that had died 50 years prior to the time she was dragged into. The jewel was ripped from her body and the demon that dragged her through time was defeated by the half-demon that she freed who was pinned to the tree. Kagome befriended the half-demon, Inuyasha, in time and traveled with him to restore the jewel that she, herself, shattered. Though it was not so straightforward and easy to do as many demons and humans sought the jewel for their own purposes. She befriended a young kitsune demon, a monk, and a demon slayer who all traveled with her to restore the jewel.<br/><br/>Her group, however, was not the one to complete the jewel. Instead, an evil half-demon who manipulated the majority of the major events in most of her companion's lives. When he finally collected all the pieces of the jewel and made his wish on the tainted object, Kagome was drawn into the jewel itself with the intent of her making a selfish wish to keep her trapped inside forever, keeping the jewel alive. It was the stubbornness of Inuyasha that managed to save her from the darkness. In the end, she returned to her natural time, finished high school as was expect from a girl of her timeline. Though days later, Kagome ended up in Elysion. She has been in this world for five years, and has long since given up on returning home. She's settled happily into her new life.<br/><br/>platonic<br/><br/>It's rather easy for Kagome to make new friends, she hasn't changed much from her youth. She is a cheerful young woman who is empathetic and welcoming to most of all in her life. In her youth, she befriended demons when most would fear them. Even demons that used to eat humans, she has befriended and she changed their ways (she'd like to think). This being said, it's really easy to become her friend as long as someone is able to shown that they are willing to be redeemed, or show that they are not completely evil. She feels greatly for everyone she meets, so it's hard for her not to be drawn to others in a desire to be friends.<br/><br/>antagonistic<br/><br/>The only way to earn Kagome's wrath is to be so deplorable, so evil, and so far beyond redemption that she can't see any good in you. And she can see the good in pretty much everyone and everything. Honestly, with whom she has faced? A half-demon that pitted two lovers against each other, that cursed the entire male line of one of her friends, and then had her best friend's brother kill their family… Yeah, I don't see her hating anyone without them really, really working for it. Feel free to give it a shot, though.<br/><br/>romantic<br/><br/>When in love, Kagome is a strong support, always staying there even when things may be rough. However, Kagome is not looking for love, wasn't looking for love when she arrived so any past relationships don't exist. This isn't to say that someone hasn't fallen in love with her. She can definitely be the subject of someone's unrequited love, she'll probably be oblivious about it, though. Finally, Kagome is currently engaged to Sesshoumaru, surprisingly. I'm totally open to potential AU things, though. <3<br/><br/>fandom hell<br/><br/>age ancient<br/><br/>species space queen<br/><br/>occupation dying<br/><br/>prefers she/her<br/><br/>awards<br/><br/>pro<br/>she/her est 62woo i suck at plot replies. but ok anyway!!! neptune is very friendly and has that 'cool' persona, he's really fun to be around, and he's SUPER good to work with. like he's super patient and he'll do anything she asks of him--he's really easy to work with, definitely in comparison to other models. so i love the idea of them being all work oriented friends at first and then turning into something more. neptune definitely tries to surround himself with people, because he loves having friends, and kagome is pretty much his type too? like she's sweet and she's a strong woman, and he is actually better friends with women than he is with men, idk why, he just loves being surrounded by female friends who knows. i love my guys being super good friends and protecting their girl friends honestly. but oh M A N i love pseduo-family type relationships and neptune is an only child, so he hasn't had any like, familial relationships like that. so her looking out for him all big sister like would make him be like ????? cause he's confused but also he actually really likes that LOL! they're both good kids, i think they'd be really fun ^^<br/><br/>fandom fire emblem: fates<br/><br/>age ninteen<br/><br/>species Part human / part dragon<br/><br/>occupation representative guardian<br/><br/>prefers she/her<br/><br/>awards<br/><br/>yonder<br/>she/her aest 20 posts<br/><br/>I haven't seen Inuyasha at all but... from what I've read Kagome seems to be one of those people who might be able to help Corrin out with her emotional state. There's a lot weighing on her mind since she had to fight her birth family against her will and last time she saw them they all pretty much hated her. Frankly she hasn't worked through everything yet since she was essentially at the head of a full-scale war. I feel they could be friends as Corrin is quite open in her personality, extremely trusting as well. She's just... hiding and struggling through a lot.

I love your idea of Kagome taking a pic of Elsa! You know, she's also a singer/performer at a local theater so I can imagine Kagome going there to scope things out and then catching Elsa backstage or something--and then the friendship could blossom from there!

Viņa var arī sajust dēmoniskas auras, kā arī ļaunas auras. Tomēr, kad viņa piedzima un auga, viņas pilnvaras tika aizzīmogotas, un viņa bija daudz mazāk spēcīga. Kopš viņas pilnvaru sakāves Kagome ir sasniegusi savu pilno potenciālu.<br/><br/>ATTĪRĪŠANA Veicot fizisku savienojumu, Kagome spēj attīrīt gan indi, gan tumsu no objekta (dzīvās un nedzīvās). Lai to izdarītu, viņa ar roku projicē savus garīgos spēkus.<br/><br/>SPIRITUĀLĀS BARJERAs Ar pilnu potenciālu, Kagome spēj radīt barjeru ap sevi un paplašināt to ap citiem.

Viņa ir sevi apmācīti, un pēc gadu prakses, viņas bulta reti neizmanto savu zīmi. Līdztekus tam, Kagome ir spēja uzliet viņas bultas ar pilnvarām. Viņa var uzliet bultas ar savām garīgajām spējām, kas ļauj tām iekļūt dēmoniskajos spēkos, iznīcināt viļņus un attīrīt priekšmetus. Viņa var uzliet savu loku ar savām pilnvarām un novirzīt ienaidnieka uzbrukumus. Viņai ir iespēja ievilkt bultas ar attīrošu enerģiju, lai attīrītu indi, kā arī spēcīgus, garus dēmoniskus uzbrukumus.

Tas bija skaņa tālu atmiņas, balss, ka viņa sāka aizmirst, bet izmisīgi turējās pie visiem vienādi. Tā bija viņas mātes balss, kas savīti viņas zaudētās meitas bēdās. Pēc tam Kagome izraidīja bez pēdām. Viņa spilgti atcerējās šos mirkļus, to, kā diena bija sākusies, ko viņa bija brokastīs un pēdējā lieta, ko viņa teica savai mātei. Tā bija haunting, šīs atmiņas, jo tas bija tāpat kā jebkurā citā laikā viņa bija paslīdēja starp pasaulēm. Viņa bija pamodies, gurdens, jo viņai nebija mērķis ārpus skolas. Viņa varēja atrast darbu, un bija plānots uz interviju tajā dienā. Viņas sirds nebija tajā, bet tas bija tas, ko viņai vajadzēja darīt.<br/><br/>Viņa atcerējās bailes sajūtu, sūkājot to un dodot sev pep runu, ka viņa to varētu izdarīt. Ka viņa varētu progresēt dzīvē, kas viņai bija paredzēta tagad, kad lietas bija atrisinātas pagātnē. Protams, viņai bija ieilgusi sajūta, ka viņa vairs nav ne savā laikā, ne savā dzīvē.<br/><br/>Kagome atcerējās sajūtu koka zem viņas pirkstiem, kā viņas roka bija krokainajām roktura slīdēt durvis atvērtas. Viņa atcerējās, ka viņa apstājās, pagriezās pret savu māti ar spilgtu un dinamiskas smaidu, kā viņa kratīja sevi no viņas stupors. "Es paceļos." Viņa atcerējās, cik spēcīga bija viņas balss, smaids uz mātes lūpām, kad viņas acis spīdēja ar lepnumu. Viņas māte atvadījās, kas nešķita savādāk nekā iepriekš, bet kaut kādā veidā vārdu svars, kas bija smagāks par Kagomes pleciem, jo vairāk viņa atspoguļoja.<br/><br/>Īsi sakot, domas mirgoja uz priekšu, domājot, vai viņas māte uztraucas par viņu, neatbildēja, kā viņa to darīja. Kagome varēja atklāti atzīt, ka viņas mātes spēks, viņas atbalsts tam, ka viņas meita tik bieži izslīdēja. Bija reizes, kad viņa domāja sevi vāja, kam nav sieviete paļauties uz.<br/><br/>Taču viņa atcerējās, ka ir paņēmusi līdzi niecīgu daudzumu spēka, un atcerējās gaisa temperatūras izmaiņas, kas ievērojami atšķīrās no tām, ko viņa bija gaidījusi, mirgojot pēkšņā un nepazīstamā vidē. Tā nebija viņas ģimenes svētnīca. Un, kad viņa pagriezās, lai dotos atpakaļ, lai paslīdētu pa durvīm, caur kurām viņa bija nonākusi, viņa satikās ar nepazīstamu un aukstu metālu zem viņas pirkstu galiem un interjeru, kas nebija viņas mājas ieeja. Vīrs stāvēja viņas priekšā, aiz letes, kurš skatījās uz viņu ar acīm, kas ir tikpat plata kā viņas pašas.<br/><br/>Viņa nebija panikas, vismaz. Būt plosītos cauri laikam un ievieto neiespējamās situācijās vismaz būvēts savu gribasspēku, cik dīvaini notikumi gāja. Tāpēc, ka ne katru dienu kāds atklāja, ka viņu pagātnē vilcis dēmons, gribēdams izraut no ķermeņa varenu dārgakmeni, par ko viņi pat nezināja. Un tad tur bija fakts, ka viņa bija sagrautas teica spēcīgs dārgakmens, kas zina, cik daudz gabalu un tika uzdots atrast tos. Šādas lietas nebija normāli, un viņai bija nepieciešams, lai kvadrātveida un roll ar to, kad viņa saprata, ka tā bija viņas realitāte. Tas šķita tik vienkārši, tikai savākt gabaliņi un noteikt dārgakmens.<br/><br/>Bet tas nebija viegli, bija daudz ļauno garu pēc lauskas un dārglietas; un bija kāds sevišķi spēcīgs dēmons, kas vēlējās, lai tas piepildītos. Līdz pat šai dienai, viņa nekad nav iemācījušies savu vēlmi, bet zināja, ka tas nekad nav piešķirts, pat tad, kad viņš bija blasted lieta pabeigta. Viņš bija izpostītu tik daudz dzīvi labad neko. Ruined tik daudz dzīvi šādu veltīgu uzdevumu. Naraku bija visgrūtākais ienaidnieks, un tas, kurš bija bijis centrs visam, kas bija nogājis greizi visā viņas drauga dzīvē.<br/><br/>Bet, tas bija, ka neparedzamība, ka nepieciešamība roll ar to, kas notiek, un gribasspēks, ka viņa bija gūta no viņas piedzīvojumu, ka viņa atcerējās zīmēšanas pēc nākt klajā ar stāstu, kas iederas brīdī, kas nešķiet pārāk dīvains vai tālu fetched. Viņai vajadzēja ticēt, viņai vajadzēja izdzīvot.<br/><br/>Pēc tam viņa bija nonākusi sliktākā situācijā nekā kāds vīrietis, kas strādāja fotoaparātu veikalā, un viņa bija izgājusi cauri saviem zobiem, lai glābtu savu dzīvību.<br/><br/>"Es meklēju darbu." Galu galā tas nebija pilnīgs meli. Galu galā viņa bija izgājusi no savas mājas, lai apmeklētu darba interviju. Viņas kleita vismaz apliecinātu to daudz. Tas bija viens no vieglākajiem fibs, ko viņa jebkad bija stāstījusi.<br/><br/>Un kaut kāda iemesla dēļ tas trakais viņu nolīga.<br/><br/>(LV)<br/><br/>Kagomed apgāzās savā gultā, kā viņa uzstāja atpakaļ tālu atmiņas, atsakoties atzīt, ka viņa bija patiešām nomodā. Viņa clawed pie pēdējā ieskatu miega, ubagošanā to atgriezties un ņemt viņu atpakaļ savā apskāvienā. Viņa aizvēra acis, vēlējās gulēt un satika tikai ar atmiņām. Dziesmas atbalsis dziedāja viņas atmiņu attālumā, dziesma, kas viņai bieži bija mocījusi, ņemot vērā tādu pašu vārdu kā viņai. Balss, kas dziedāja, vairs neatgādināja viņas māti, bet gan to bērnu balsis, kurus viņa bieži bija spēlējusi ar pieaugšanu. Viņi atsauca atmiņas, lai gan bija pagājuši gadi, kopš viņa sāka dzīvot, lai gan viņa bija laimīga šajā dzīvē, šo atmiņu sauciens bija pārāk skaļš.<br/><br/>Pēkšņi, viņa bija krīt atpakaļ uz tiem un gulēt izvairījās viņu vēlreiz. Viņa bija skatoties sevi viņas ģimenes apskāviens, bet Inuyasha tika velk atpakaļ uz akas, meklē kā pārsteigts, kā viņa bija jutos. Atmiņas par šo brīdi, šīs jūtas, joprojām bija tik spēcīga. Sirdslēkme un skumjas sajūta uzlabojās atkal, lai gan tas bija tik ilgi, jo viņa bija jutusies kā viņa bija ripped prom no visa, kas svarīgi viņai.<br/><br/>Protams, viņas ģimenei tas bija svarīgi, un viņa bija laimīga, ka atkal var dzīvot savās rokās. Viņa joprojām nevarēja izskaidrot, kā viņa jutās sadalīta divās daļās, ar karojošām vēlmēm būt gan savā pagātnē, gan tagadnē. Viņa atcerējās veltīgos mēģinājumus lēkt caur aku, pirkstus, kas pieskaras zemei izmisīgā lūgumā ļaut viņai atgriezties. Pirmajā mēnesī mājās, viņa negulēja tik daudz, kā viņa raudāja.<br/><br/>Elysion bija rotāti līdzīgu reakciju, lai gan tas nebija tik sīva, jo viņa nezināja, kur tieši viņa bija paslīdēja cauri, ne viņa nezināja, kur viņa varētu tārps savu ceļu atpakaļ. Viņas pētījumi bija smalks starp strādā savu darbu un mēģina apmesties uz šo dzīvi. viņai nebija nodoma palikt, nav nodoma kavēties ilgāk, nekā viņai nepieciešams. Un, kamēr viņa nemēģināja tik nikni kā agrāk, kad viņa mēģināja atgriezties pagātnē, viņas kaislība bija desmitkārtīga, jo viņai nebija nekādu saišu ar šo pasauli.<br/><br/>Savos iracionālajos brīžos viņa domāja, ka dārgakmens viņu ir vilcis atpakaļ un atradis jaunu elli, kurā viņa varētu dzīvot. Jauna elle, kas piespiestu viņu izteikt vēlēšanos, bet viņa ļoti skaidri atcerējās, ka viņa vēlējusies, lai tā būtu aizgājusi uz visiem laikiem. Tas neapturēja viņas sapņus, laikus, kad viņa pamodās nakts šņukstēja. Un šīs atmiņas par viņas pagātni bija visgrūtāk tikt galā, visgrūtāk aizmirst. Viņas sirds sāka rase panikā, kā viņa pagriezās savā gultā atkal, viņas elpa kļuva cīņa, jo viņa cīnījās pret panikas lēkme, ko izraisa viņas wandering prātā tas vēlu naktī.<br/><br/>Viņa ienīst sajūta tik vāja, tik bail.<br/><br/>(LV)<br/><br/>Kagome beidzot izvilka sevi no gultas, viņas istaba izgaismota ar gaišu gaismu, kas bija pietiekami, lai vadītu viņu uz vannas istabu. Viņa stāvēja pie spoguļa, izlietne darbojas, kamēr viņa skatījās uz viņas pārdomām. Raven krāsas mati uz viņas sejas, un viņa jutās tik slikti, kā viņa izskatījās. Viņas pirmais rīts Elysion bija līdzīgs šim, tikai viņa bija sliktākā formā.<br/><br/>Viņa bija atradusi vietu, kur pagulēt, un spēja vienoties ar ēkas īpašnieku, lai viņa varētu kādu laiku palikt, nemaksājot par to. Varbūt tā bija Miroku ietekme, kas ļāva viņai streikot šādus darījumus, jo mūks bija pazīstams ar savu ceļu burvīgs (vai scamming) cilvēki piešķirot viņiem vairāk nekā pietiekami par darbu, ko viņi bija darījuši. Mūks vienmēr bija bijis, ka veidā, jo viņi pirmo reizi tikās. Viņš apgalvo, mājokli kungs vajā, kad tas nebija, vai, apgalvojot, ka tie bija pakļauti uzbrukumam, kad tie nebūtu. Viņš varētu pārdot savu palātu un piekariņi par tik augstām cenām. Tas darbojās praktiski katru reizi, un viņa brīnījās, kāpēc cilvēki bija tik gatavi viņam uzticēties.<br/><br/>Varbūt tas bija viņa smaids, vai tas, ka viņš bija mūks, ka cilvēki no pagātnes bija tik gatavi drupināt. Viņš nekad nav bijis par vāju, vismaz. Viņš vienmēr darīja to, kas bija pareizi, un viņš viņai bija spēka simbols brīžos, kad viņš visu izspieda, lai darītu to, kas bija pareizi. Viņš uzstājām caur to, ka viņš mirst, ka viņš bija nolādēts, un mēģināja darīt kaut ko par to, nevis wallowing viņa likteni. Viņš bija uzstājām sevi līdz robežai, kas noved līdz to pēdējā cīņa. Un viņa bija priecīga, ka viņi bija uzvarējuši Naraku, pirms viņš varēja kļūt pakļauts tādam pašam liktenim kā viņa tēvs, un viņa tēvs pirms viņa.<br/><br/>Ciktāl viņas pašas piekariņi gāja, tomēr viņa bija taisnīgāka nekā viņas draugs un padarīja darījumu saprātīgu. Viņa šaubījās, ka ikviens šajā pasaulē maksās dūšīgu cenu par eksorcismu vai izraidīšanu dēmoniem. Viņi bija pārāk tehnoloģiski attīstīti. Bet viņa bija pietiekami gudra un pietiekami gudra, lai izdarītu labu darījumu.<br/><br/>Bet tagad, Kagome bija labākā vietā, lai gan skatīties uz viņas sejas izskatījās tāpat. Haunted, noguris, nosusināti...<br/><br/>Ātri paskatās pulksteni uz sienas viņai teica, ka viņa varētu mēģināt gulēt ilgāk. Bet viņa atteicās no tā, nevis vēlas saskarties flashbacks vēlreiz. Viņa paņēma dušu vietā, izmantojot aukstu ūdeni, lai tramdīt prom savus dēmonus, lai aizpildītu viņas plaušas ar asu ieplūdes elpu un piespiest sevi nomodā.<br/><br/>(LV)<br/><br/>Tas nedarbojās.<br/><br/>Ne tādā veidā, kā viņa vēlējās. Aukstais ūdens noteikti piespieda gaisu plaušās, piespieda viņas prātu pamosties un muskuļus izmantot. No lūpām tika izvilkts rūgts smiekli, kad viņa nolieca galvu atpakaļ un atrada sevi atceroties vairāk. Šodien, viņa nebija gatavojas, lai izvairītos no tiem tik viegli. Viņa nebija gatavojas atgūt tik vienkārši, lai atgūtu tikai tāpēc, ka viņa gribēja to.<br/><br/>Dažreiz nav iespējams izvairīties no domām, kuras vēlējāties. Pat tad, kad bijāt pārliecināts, ka esat viņiem garām.<br/><br/>Sango būtu bijis liels palīdzēt šajā situācijā. Dēmons slepkava bija viņas labākais draugs, viņa pat iet tik tālu, lai izsauktu viņai māsa, ka viņa nekad nav bijusi. Vecāka māsa, kas bija gudrs, vienmēr bija viņas pusē, kad radās nepatikšanas. Īpaši zēns nepatikšanas, kad šādas lietas bija diezgan triviāls, bet tas bija jautri, lai būtu simpātijas un viņas draugs, lai būtu mad viņas vārdā, kad Inuyasha padarīja viņas skumji. Galu galā, tas bija bieži, ka puse-dēmons varētu palaist uz savu mirušo mīļāko pusē un lauzt viņas sirdi vairāk nekā vienu reizi.<br/><br/>Bet, Sango arī iedvesmoja viņu citos veidos. Pēc tam, kad sieviete bija saskārusies, viņa vienmēr bija tik spēcīga, tik pārliecināts... Pat laikos, ka viņa bija šaubījās sevi, viņa vienmēr velk cauri. Viņa apbrīnoja, ka viņai bija spēja izdzīvot pēc zaudēt visu savu ģimeni -- atgādinājums par to bieži uzstāja Kagome, lai izdzīvotu, jo viņa zaudēja visus šajā pasaulē - un tad, ņemot viņas brālis kļūst bandinieks Naraku. Tas nebija viegli, nevarēja būt kaut kas, ka tikai kāds varētu saskarties un vēl iet uz priekšu ar. Viņa joprojām pasmaidīja, pat ar šīm sāpēm un tiem atgādinājumiem... Viņa bieži bija tik spilgti, pat tumšākos laikos.<br/><br/>Un tieši tagad, viņa gribēja, lai liesās vērā vecākās sievietes pusē, lai mierinātu ar to, ka viņa bija tur, un viņa bija atbalstoša. Viņa juta, ka Sango kaut kā pull caur šo, un piedāvāt dažus vārdus spēku un sapratni. Tas bija laiki, piemēram, šie, kas padarīja šos viļņus sliktāk, pastāvīgu atgādinājumu, ka viņa bija bez viņas ģimenes.<br/><br/>"Es negribu būt viens." Viņa sauca skaļi viņas vientulībā, skaņu dušas noslīcināt pamatu.<br/><br/>Viņa nebaidījās to atzīt.<br/><br/>(LV)<br/><br/>Vēl viena stunda bija paslīdēja, pirms viņa bija sapratuši to. Viņas āda bija auksts no ūdens, un tas jutās kā ledus skrēja caur viņas vēnām. Viņa nebija sapratusi, viņa bija sākusi drebēt, kamēr viņas roka sasniedza, lai izslēgtu ūdeni un beigtu savu dušu. Kagome vairs nemeklēja savu skatienu spogulī, tā vietā viņa ietinās dvieļos un izgāja no vannas istabas, augšup pa kāpnēm un savā virtuvē. Viņa sāka gatavot vieglas brokastis, bezrūpīgi izlasot dienas piezīmes, kad ēdiens tika pagatavots.<br/><br/>Viņas karjera bija patiešām pacelties šiem pēdējiem gadiem. Viņas fotogrāfijas bija redzamas daudzās galerijās, viņas vārds sāka bieži daudzas lūpas tiem, kas interesējas par fotogrāfiju.<br/><br/>Darbs, ko viņa bija lūgusi kaprīzei, to visu izraisīja. Viņai bija daudz vairāk paveicies, nekā viņa bija gaidījusi šajā pasaulē. Nekad nav paveicies, lai izslīdētu caur plaisām savā pasaulē, bet ir paveicies, lai to izdarītu labi. Kad viņa pagriezās atpakaļ uz plīts, viņa atcerējās laiku, kad viņa beidzot bija atteikusies atgriezties mājās. Tas bija apmēram divus gadus viņas dzīvē šeit, jo viņa bija sākusi uzdrošināties fotografēt kā vairāk nekā tikai hobijs, bet kaut ko viņa varētu darīt sev ar nosaukumu.<br/><br/>Šī diena bija bijusi īpaši patīkama, saule bija augstu debesīs, un viņa bija atradusi sevi, fotografējot dabas ainavas. Mazs zēns bija paslēptas vienā no augiem, un viņa bija nozvejotas priekšstatu par brīdi, kad viņa seja bija apmetušies uz jautrs, ļauns ņirgt brīdī, pirms viņš bija izlēca satracināt savu laupījumu. Tas viņai atgādināja Shippou, mazo kitsune viņa būtībā bija adoptēts. Viņš arī bija atrauts no viņa ģimenes, kad viņi pirmo reizi tikās. Viņa tēvs nogalināja, un viņš bija apņēmies atriebt viņu. Kamēr viņš bija jauns, pirmajās tikšanās reizēs viņš izskatījās tik nobriedis.<br/><br/>Varbūt tas bija ietekme Inuyasha kas ļāva komplekts darboties kā mazulis atkal, lai būtu jauni un dīvains pie reizes, kamēr citi viņš bija vairāk nobriedis. Viņš piedāvāja mierinājumu viņai savā veidā, un viņa mēģināja rūpēties par viņu, kā viņa būtu viņas, lai gan viņa bija tik jauns, tad arī. Tomēr, viņas jaunība neapturēja viņu no izpratnes, kā mēdz viņam vai rūpēties par viņu, piemēram, viņas bērns. Viņas sirds uzbriest, kad viņš pasmaidīja, kad viņš bija tik laimīgs par savu dāvanu krītiņi un paņēma laiku, lai padarītu mākslu. Viņa bija tik lepns par katru zīmējumu, ka viņš bija beidzis, ka viņa zināja, ka tas bija kā māte justos šādā situācijā.<br/><br/>Sāpes, kas bija ripped caur viņu bija pārāk daudz, pārāk pēkšņi. Viņa neatbildētos viņu un gribēja redzēt, cik daudz viņš bija pieaudzis, jo viņa bija aizgājuši. Viņa bija garām tik daudz...<br/><br/>Lai pasargātu sevi no jebkādām turpmākām sāpēm, jebkādas viltus cerības... viņa padevās un koncentrējās uz sevis pilnveidošanu.<br/><br/>(LV)<br/><br/>Brokastis garšoja, garlaicīgs, un iedvesmoja. Tikai pēc tam, kad viņa bija pabeigta, viņa saprata, viņa bija aizmirsusi jebkāda veida garšvielas vai garšu uz pārtiku. Bija jau par vēlu, lai atcerētos, ka viņas prāts bija pārāk aizņemts, atceroties citas viņas dzīves detaļas, kas acīmredzot bija kļuvušas svarīgākas par viņas ēdienu.<br/><br/>"Sēdi!"<br/><br/>Protams, nekas nenotika, kad viņa dusmīgi kliedza uz vienu īpaši neapmierinošu klientu, kas viņai atgādināja pusdēmonu. Viņš bija īpaši spītīgs un rupjš, vēlas, lai viņa fotogrāfija tiktu uzņemta, nevis ļaujot tai dabiski strādāt. Jūs varētu mēģināt piespiest savvaļas dzīvniekus uzvesties, kā jūs vēlaties. Bet reti bija kāds izdodas ar spēku. Inuyasha nebija tik slikti, tomēr. Inuyasha bija iemācījušies pirms viņa bija spiesti prom no viņa. Viņš bija kļuvis maigāka, vairāk izpratne, vairāk nobriedis, lai gan bija reizes, kad viņš vēl bija bērnišķīgs un iedomīgs.<br/><br/>Viņa atceras, kā sarkanie vaigi bija sadedzinājuši, bet kā viņa stāvēja un atlaida viņu. Viņa teica, ka viņa atteicās strādāt ikvienam vai kopā ar ikvienu, kurš vēlējās pagriezt kaut ko ārpus tā dabas, ārpus tā paša vēlmēm.<br/><br/>Viņai vajadzēja salīdzināt cilvēku ar Naraku, nevis Inujašu. Lai gan viņas klientam nebija tik ārkārtēju nodomu. Vismaz sajūta pēc tam bija patīkama atmiņa. Brīvība zināt, ka viņa ir atnākusi tik tālu, ka var atteikties no darba, ko viņa negrib darīt, būt par savu personu, kas ir neatkarīga no citiem. Viņa varētu teikt, ka viņa to izdarīja tajā brīdī. Lai gan viņa dzirdēja baumas dienas vēlāk ar vārdiem, kas domāti, lai apmelot viņu.<br/><br/>Viņa aizstāvēja sevi taisnīgi, tāpat kā viņa to darīja sava ceļojuma beigās. Galu galā viņa bija vienīgā, kas varēja pasargāt sevi šajā pasaulē.<br/><br/>(LV)<br/><br/>Rīta gaisma sāka ielīst viņas mājās, atkal atgādinot viņai par laika gaitu. Atkal viņa apsvēra sarakstu ar lietām, kas viņai bija jādara, un apsprieda, kur sākt. Vai, ja viņai pat vajadzētu sākt vispār. Ar to, kā sākās diena, viņa nezināja, vai viņa varētu uzskatīt, ka tā ir lieliska ideja. Tas bija apšaubāms, ka viņa būtu veiksmīga ar to, kā viņa zaudēja sevī.<br/><br/>Viņa negribēja izjaukt savu jaunāko darbu, jo viņa to bija izdarījusi pāris reizes. Nebija patīkami mēģināt atgūties no pilnīgas katastrofas.<br/><br/>Kagome atcerējās sajūtu viņas dārgi, pavisam jaunu, kameru slīdēšanu no viņas rokām. Viņa nebija gatava to atbalstīt, jo viņa bija tikko izņemta no viņas maisā. Daļa no viņas kliedza no iekšpuses. Dramatisks, pār-the-top, pilns ar kliedzienu, ka viņa bieži darīja, kad viņa bija daudz, daudz jaunāks. Kad viņa bija cīnās, lai padarītu to caur vidusskolu, kamēr lēciena starp laikiem. Otra viņas daļa bija palikusi neaizsalusi, kamēr viņas lēca bija pilnīgi sadragāta, un pārējā kamera bija salūzusi kopā ar to.<br/><br/>Redzot Inuyasha brālis, pilna dēmons, stāvot viņas priekšā bija pēdējā lieta, ko viņa gaidīja, kad viņa bija veikusi savu ceļu ārā viņas fotogrāfijas. Viņš stāvēja kā lepns kā jebkad, tikpat garš kā jebkad, kā uzlikt kā viņa atcerējās. Viņš neizskatījās fuzed vispār būt pilnīgi citā pasaulē, lai gan viņa nekad nebija labākais lasot viņa prātu. Viņa vārds uz viņas lūpām bija tik spēcīgs, ka viņa varēja atcerēties mazākās jūtas, kā viņa to darīja. Viņas lūpas bija sasprēgājušas, mute bija sausa, un nemiera sajūta vēderā viņai lika justies slimai.<br/><br/>Viņa negribēja, lai viņas cerības pieaug.<br/><br/>Bet viņa gribēja, lai viņš būtu tur, pat ja viņi nebūtu draugi. Viņi bija sabiedrotie, ja kaut kas, jo viņi cīnījās plecu pie pleca. Un kaut kas bija labāks nekā nekas.<br/><br/>Un Kagome bija sajūta pietiekami, lai mest sevi uz viņu, lai wrap viņas rokas ap viņu atvieglojums, ka zinot, viņa nebija viena. Viņas kamera vairs nav svarīgi, kad viņa tuvojās viņam. Viņa atcerējās, ka nekas cits svarīgi dienām, kā viņa pavadīja laiku ar viņu, nevis runājot par savu pasauli, bet gan (vai, viņa runāja, un viņš vienkārši atzina šo faktu).<br/><br/>Kad, tieši tā, viņa krita par viņu, lai gan... Kagome nevarēja atcerēties. Tā bija smalks lieta, tāpat kā viņš bija. Bet viņa zināja sajūta bija tur. Un viņš let viņai zināt, ka viņa nebija viena, jo tas, ka viņa bija samazinājies, ka jūtas bija kaut kā uzplaukusi.<br/><br/>(LV)<br/><br/>Sajūta bezsvara pārspēja viņu un pēkšņi viņas acis atvērās, kamēr viņas prāts izmisīgi clawed par pēdējo lieta, viņa dara. Viņa neatcerējās, kad viņa bija aizmigusi uz viņas dīvāna, bet viņa zināja, pēdējā vietā viņa bija uz pārāk ērti spilveni. Viņa nebija cīņa, tomēr, vai cīnīties bezsvara, jo viņa bija pazīstami rokās. Viņas galva noliecās pret Sesshoumaru krūtīs, ņemot komforts ar to, ka viņš bija šeit, un viņa nebija viena.<br/><br/>"Laipni lūdzam atpakaļ." Viņa atbilde bija maigs hum. Viņam nebija daudz jārunā, lai viņa saprastu savu nodomu vai pārējo to, ko viņam bija jāsaka.<br/><br/>Viņš nesa viņas atpakaļ uz gultu, apmetās viņai tajā ar vieglumu. Viņas acis met viņa un viņa smaidīja viegli, jo ne vairāk atmiņas dreifēja atpakaļ, ne vairāk atmiņas teased pie viņas. Nē, kad viņš bija tuvu, viņa nekad krita atpakaļ šajās domās. Viņš bija palīdzējis, un gadi bija palīdzējuši. Šodien bija tikai... Viena no tām dienām.<br/><br/>"Miegs." Viņš pavēlēja ar vieglumu, viņas acis velmēta pie viņa, bet viņa nav cīņa, jo viņa bija noguris. Viņas roka turējās cieši pie viņa, kamēr viņa juta savu pretējo roku nospiediet uz pieres vērtējot viņas labklājību.<br/><br/>"Man ir labi," viņa teica, viņas vārdi firma ar savu solījumu.<br/><br/>Viņai viss bija kārtībā, viņa bija dzīva, un viņa bija laimīga.<br/><br/>(LV)<br/><br/>nosūtītājs<br/><br/>kopsavilkums<br/><br/>Kagome, kādā savas dzīves brīdī, bija diezgan regulāra pusaudze, līdz viņai uzbruka dēmons viņas ģimenes akas mājā. Dēmons vilka viņu lejā akā, kas maģiski aizveda apmēram 500 gadus pagātnē. Tur viņa uzzināja, ka viņas ķermenī ir apslēpts svēts dārgakmens, jo tajā ir iemiesojusies priestera, kas bija nomirusi 50 gadus pirms tam, kad viņa tika ierauta. Dārgakmens tika izvilkts no viņas ķermeņa, un dēmons, kas viņu vilka cauri laikam, tika uzvarēts ar pusdēmonu, ko viņa atbrīvoja, kurš bija piesprausts pie koka. Kagome sadraudzējās ar pusi dēmonu, Inuyasha, laikā un ceļoja kopā ar viņu, lai atjaunotu dārgakmens, ka viņa pati, satriekts.Lai gan tas nebija tik vienkārši un viegli darīt tik daudz dēmoniem un cilvēkiem meklēja dārgakmens saviem mērķiem. Viņa sadraudzējās ar jaunu kitune dēmonu, mūku un dēmonu slepkavu, kurš visi ceļoja kopā ar viņu, lai atjaunotu dārgakmeni.<br/><br/>Tomēr viņas grupa nebija tā, kas pabeidza dārgakmeni. Tā vietā ļaunums pusdēmons, kurš lielākajā daļā savu biedru dzīves manipulēja ar lielāko daļu galveno notikumu. Kad viņš beidzot savāca visus dārgakmens gabalus un izteica savu vēlmi uz sabojāta objekta, Kagome tika ievilkta pašā dārgakmens ar nolūku padarīt egoistisku vēlmi saglabāt viņu iesprostotu mūžīgi, saglabājot dārgakmens dzīvs. Tā bija Inujašas spītība, kas viņai izdevās glābt no tumsas. Galu galā viņa atgriezās savā dabiskajā laikā, pabeidza vidusskolu, kā tas bija sagaidāms no viņas laika līnijas meitenes. Lai gan dienas vēlāk Kagome nonāca Elizejā. Viņa ir bijusi šajā pasaulē piecus gadus, un jau sen ir atteikusies atgriezties mājās. Viņa ir laimīgi apmetusies savā jaunajā dzīvē.<br/><br/>platonijs<br/><br/>Kagome ir diezgan viegli iegūt jaunus draugus, viņa nav daudz mainījusies no savas jaunības. Viņa ir jautra jauna sieviete, kas ir empātiska un laipni lielākā daļa no visiem savā dzīvē. Savā jaunībā viņa sadraudzējās ar dēmoniem, kad lielākā daļa no viņiem baidās. Pat dēmoni, kas agrāk ēda cilvēkus, viņa ir sadraudzējusies, un viņa mainīja savus veidus (viņa gribētu domāt). Tas nozīmē, ka ir ļoti viegli kļūt par viņas draugu, ja vien kāds spēj parādīt, ka viņi ir gatavi izpirkt, vai parādīt, ka viņi nav pilnīgi ļauni. Viņa jūtas ļoti ikvienam, ko viņa satiek, tāpēc viņai nav grūti piesaistīt citus, kas vēlas būt draugi.<br/><br/>antagonisti<br/><br/>Vienīgais veids, kā nopelnīt Kagomes dusmas, ir būt tik nožēlojamam, tik ļaunam un tik tālu, cik izpirkšana, ka viņa nevar redzēt labu tevī. Un viņa var redzēt labu gandrīz ikvienam un visam. Godīgi sakot, ar kuru viņa ir saskārusies? Pusdemons, kas atkauloja divus mīļotājus viens pret otru, kas nolādēja visu viņas draugu vīriešu līniju, un tad lika viņas labākā drauga brālim nogalināt viņu ģimeni... Jā, es neredzu, ka viņa ienīstu nevienu bez viņiem, patiešām strādā pie tā. Jūtieties brīvi, lai dotu tai shot, though.<br/><br/>romantiskas<br/><br/>Kad mīlestībā, Kagome ir spēcīgs atbalsts, vienmēr uzturas tur, pat tad, ja lietas var būt raupja. Tomēr, Kagome nav meklē mīlestību, nebija meklē mīlestību, kad viņa ieradās, lai kādi pagātnes attiecības neeksistē. Tas nav teikt, ka kāds nav iemīlējies viņu. Viņa noteikti var būt priekšmets kāda neatlīdzināmi mīlestību, viņa, iespējams, būs aizmirst par to, lai gan. Visbeidzot, Kagome pašlaik nodarbojas ar Sesshoumaru, pārsteidzoši.

| Why You Should be on Twitter<br/><br/>Disclaimer: I am not, nor have I ever claimed to be, a social media guru. I'm just a person who thinks about stuff a lot, and this has come up a number of times.<br/><br/>I'm not an early adopter. Sometimes it takes me years to figure out what I want to use something for before I actually get on it, and Twitter was one of those things. I've been on Twitter seriously since about February of this year, so I'm pretty new at it. Still, I've learned a number of things, and I wanted to share them. Some people say I'm a Twitter pusher, and I am, because there's lots of good reasons to get on it, and virtually no downsides.<br/><br/>So what's Twitter? If you're on the internet, you've probably at least heard of it. It's a social media network that serves as a forum for conversations, updates, and news in a medium more public than something like Facebook or LinkedIn. Facebook is about who wants to find you, but Twitter is about who you want to find. Your favourite writers, actors, politicians, singers, and scientists are probably on Twitter. So are your favourite charities, radio stations, news sites, and stores. And they want you to find them and listen to what they have to say. Everyone on Twitter, at least initially, wants to talk with you.<br/><br/>But why join that? Why be a part of it? There's all kinds of reasons, and I'm going to give you a few.<br/><br/>People and Places Twitter is a great way to find out about events which are going on around the world, but also in your community. If you're travelling and looking for things to do, it's a great way to find out about things relevant to your interests (because the people you follow are people you're interested in). Even if you're not travelling, knowing about great places to go locally or knowing that people you're interested in are going to them creates an opportunity to meet them and create a deeper relationship with them. If you go back to my party post, all the people in it but two, I heard about on Twitter and then met in real life, and now we're pretty good friends. And the more you do this, the more things you'll find out about, and the more people you'll meet. And if you follow them on Twitter, you already know a bit about what they're like. They want you to. The reverse is also true, because tweeting invites people to see what you're like, and they can make the same choices about you.<br/><br/>Inspiration and Motivation<br/>Inspiration comes from the strangest places, and the influx of tweets means there's always fresh content for your imagination. I have a follow first policy, so I'll follow just about anybody, and then periodically go through and unfollow people. I don't know who's going to plant the seed of a new blog post or new project in me, so I like to keep my options open. Motivation also happens, because Twitter is just like life. If you surround yourself with people who are ambitious, dedicated, generous, and hard-working, it's easier to be like that, and push yourself. It's easier to think that if they can plan events, launch projects, or just get up in the morning, well, so can you.<br/><br/>Learning and Lifestyle Bloggers are on Twitter. Bloggers who aren't may actually be crazy. And people blog about just about everything. If you're looking to learn something, odds are good that somebody's tweeting about it. On top of that, news services and stores are also connected, which means that you can get your news up to the minute, and find out about sales and deals as they start.As far as lifestyle, looking for new recipe ideas? Follow some caterers and see what they come up with. Need a twist for that cocktail party? Twitter's got people for that too. Wardrobe recommendations, or just want to see what other people are doing with their lives? It's all there.<br/><br/>There are some common challenges I face when talking about this, and they're legitimate obstacles. It can seem pretty daunting, especially if you're getting on the bandwagon late, like I did. I spent months following only two people and not knowing what else to do. But there are ways to overcome them, and hear they are from least frequent to most.<br/><br/>#3: Twitter is for Narcissistic Jerks<br/>I think this comes from the idea that most people tweet for and about themselves as a way of getting attention. What I don't get is why there's anything wrong with that, or why doing that makes one a narcissist or a jerk. If someone has something to say, they want to be heard. Used to be you'd stand on the street corner and yell. Now you can yell in 140 characters or less. Twitter's just a new way to be heard. Now, there are certainly narcissistic jerks on Twitter. They're pretty much everywhere. Sometimes, people are jerks. Sometimes one of those people is me, I'm sorry to say. Don't follow those people. If you don't like what someone is saying, whether that's points that they're making or detailed accounts of their bathroom activities, you don't have to listen on Twitter.<br/><br/>#2: I Can't Keep Track of It All<br/>The second obstacle people often bring up is that they just don't have time to keep track of all the things which are going on on Twitter. And you know what? That's fine. Keep track of what you can. Maybe you only wander on every few days. If you're a private user (rather than tweeting for your company), and especially a beginner, that's okay. Part of something is better than all of nothing.<br/><br/>#1 I've Got Nothing I Want to Put Out There<br/>This is by far the most frequent challenge people raise. And it doesn't even matter. You don't have to join Twitter to talk. Join it to listen. Again, your favourite authors, singers, bloggers, and newspapers are on here. This is your chance to listen to them. It's your chance to gain a window into their lives and activities, and they're inviting you to do that. Want to find out what Felicia Day is going to be up to at the San Diego Comic Con? Done. I know people who only listen on Twitter, and that's great. That's what I did for a while. Eventually, maybe you'll find something to tweet about, or make something to tweet about. I hope you do, because I want to hear about it.<br/><br/>In short, if you're not using Twitter, I think you should be. If you're not using it to its full extent, try to. Don't be afraid to follow five hundred people, if all of those people are saying things you're interested in. Invite those people into bits of your life, and see how it's improved by the interaction. I look forward to hearing from you. | Kāpēc jums vajadzētu būt Twitter<br/><br/>Atruna: Es neesmu un nekad neesmu apgalvojis, ka esmu sociālo mediju guru. Es esmu tikai cilvēks, kurš daudz domā par lietām, un tas ir nācis klajā vairākas reizes.<br/><br/>Es neesmu agrs adoptētājs. Dažreiz man ir vajadzīgi gadi, lai noskaidrotu, ko es vēlos kaut ko izmantot, pirms es to faktiski varu izmantot, un Twitter bija viena no šīm lietām. Esmu bijis Twitter nopietni kopš aptuveni šī gada februāra, tāpēc es esmu diezgan jauns. Tomēr es esmu iemācījies daudzas lietas, un es gribēju ar tām dalīties. Daži cilvēki saka, ka es esmu čivināt spiedējs, un es esmu, jo tam ir daudz labu iemeslu, un praktiski nav trūkumu.<br/><br/>Tātad, kas ir Twitter? Ja jūs esat internetā, jūs, iespējams, vismaz esat dzirdējuši par to. Tas ir sociālo mediju tīkls, kas kalpo kā forums sarunām, atjauninājumiem un ziņām vidēji vairāk publiski nekā kaut kas, piemēram, Facebook vai LinkedIn. Facebook ir par to, kas vēlas jūs atrast, bet Twitter ir par to, ko vēlaties atrast. Jūsu mīļākie rakstnieki, aktieri, politiķi, dziedātāji un zinātnieki, iespējams, ir Twitter. Tāpat ir jūsu iecienītākās labdarības, radio stacijas, ziņu vietnes un veikali. Un viņi vēlas, lai jūs tos atrastu un klausītos, ko viņi saka. Ikviens Twitter, vismaz sākotnēji, vēlas runāt ar jums.<br/><br/>Bet kāpēc pievienoties? Kāpēc būt daļa no tā? Ir dažādi iemesli, un es esmu gatavojas sniegt jums dažas.<br/><br/>Cilvēki un vietas Twitter ir lielisks veids, kā uzzināt par notikumiem, kas notiek visā pasaulē, bet arī savā kopienā. Ja ceļojat un meklējat ko darīt, tas ir lielisks veids, kā uzzināt par lietām, kas attiecas uz jūsu interesēm (jo cilvēki, kuriem jūs sekojat, ir cilvēki, kas jūs interesē). Pat ja jūs neceļojat, zinot par lieliskām vietām, kur doties lokāli, vai zinot, ka cilvēki, kas jūs interesē, dodas uz viņiem, rada iespēju tikties ar viņiem un veidot dziļākas attiecības ar viņiem. Ja jūs atgriežaties pie manas partijas post, visi cilvēki tajā, bet divi, es dzirdēju par čivināt un tad tikās reālajā dzīvē, un tagad mēs esam diezgan labi draugi. Un jo vairāk jūs darīt, jo vairāk lietas jūs uzzināsiet par, un jo vairāk cilvēku jūs tiksies. Un, ja jūs sekojat tiem Twitter, jūs jau zināt mazliet par to, ko viņi vēlas. Viņi vēlas, lai jūs. Arī pretējais ir taisnība, jo tweeting aicina cilvēkus redzēt, kas jums patīk, un viņi var izdarīt to pašu izvēli par jums.<br/><br/>Iedvesma un motivācija<br/>Iedvesma nāk no dīvainākajām vietām, un tweets pieplūdums nozīmē, ka vienmēr ir svaigs saturs jūsu iztēlei. Man ir jāievēro pirmā politika, tāpēc es sekošu gandrīz ikvienam, un pēc tam periodiski iet cauri un nesekot cilvēkiem. Es nezinu, kas man iesēj jaunu bloga ierakstu vai jaunu projektu, tāpēc man patīk, lai manas iespējas būtu atvērtas. Motivācija arī notiek, jo Twitter ir tāpat kā dzīve. Ja jūs ieskaujat sevi ar cilvēkiem, kuri ir ambiciozi, veltīti, dāsni un smagi strādā, ir vieglāk būt tādam un virzīt sevi. Tas ir vieglāk domāt, ka, ja viņi var plānot notikumus, uzsākt projektus, vai vienkārši piecelties no rīta, labi, lai jūs varētu.<br/><br/>Mācīšanās un dzīvesveida emuāri ir čivināt. Emuāru autori, kuri nav patiešām var būt traki. Un cilvēki blogu par gandrīz visu. Ja jūs meklējat, lai uzzinātu kaut ko, izredzes ir labi, ka kāds tweeting par to. Turklāt ir savienoti arī ziņu pakalpojumi un veikali, kas nozīmē, ka jūs varat saņemt ziņas līdz pat minūtei, un uzzināt par pārdošanu un darījumiem, kad tie sākas. Ciktāl tas attiecas uz dzīvesveidu, meklējot jaunas recepšu idejas? Sekojiet daži ēdināšanas iestādes un redzēt, ko viņi nāk klajā ar. Nepieciešams vērpjot par šo kokteili puse? Twitter ir ieguvuši cilvēkus, ka pārāk. Garderobe ieteikumi, vai vienkārši vēlaties redzēt, ko citi cilvēki dara ar savu dzīvi? Tas viss ir tur.<br/><br/>Ir dažas kopīgas problēmas, ar kurām es saskaros, runājot par to, un tie ir likumīgi šķēršļi. Tas var šķist diezgan biedējoši, it īpaši, ja jūs saņemat par bandwagon vēlu, kā es to darīju. Es pavadīju mēnešus, sekojot tikai diviem cilvēkiem un nezinot, ko vēl darīt. Bet ir veidi, kā tos pārvarēt, un dzirdēt, ka tie ir no vismazāk bieži.<br/><br/># 3: Twitter ir par narcissistic Jerks<br/>Es domāju, ka tas nāk no idejas, ka lielākā daļa cilvēku tvīto par sevi un par sevi kā veidu, kā iegūt uzmanību. Tas, ko es nesaņemu, ir, kāpēc kaut kas nav kārtībā ar to, vai kāpēc to dara, kas padara vienu narcissist vai paraut. Ja kādam ir kaut ko teikt, viņi vēlas tikt uzklausīti. Agrāk jūs stāvējāt uz ielas stūra un kliedzāt. Tagad jūs varat kliegt ar 140 rakstzīmēm vai mazāk. Twitter ir tikai jauns veids, kā tikt uzklausītam. Tagad Twitter noteikti ir narcistiski jerks. Viņi ir visur. Dažreiz cilvēki ir āksti. Dažreiz viens no tiem cilvēkiem esmu es, man žēl teikt. Neseko šiem cilvēkiem. Ja jums nepatīk tas, ko kāds saka, vai tas ir punkti, ka viņi veic vai detalizētus pārskatus par savu darbību vannas istabā, jums nav klausīties čivināt.<br/><br/># 2: Es nevaru izsekot to visu<br/>Otrs šķērslis cilvēki bieži vien audzināt ir tas, ka viņi vienkārši nav laika, lai izsekotu visām lietām, kas notiek par čivināt.

| Root Canals<br/><br/>The very thought of getting a root canal puts most people on edge. SCM Dental utilizes the latest technology and technique to make a root canal a virtually pain free and low stress procedure.<br/><br/>Rotary endodontics is an advanced technology and technique to perform endodontic treatment, the clinical term for a root canalThe term "root canal" refers to the natural cavity at the center of the tooth. The tooth's nerve is located in soft tissue (pulp) inside the root canal. If the tooth is damaged either by trauma or decay, debris can enter the sensitive root canal area and cause an infection, or in extreme circumstances, and abscess. An abscessed tooth is very serious and should be treated as an emergency, as it can create an infection that may spread to other parts of the body. If you believe you have an abscessed tooth, contact our office immediately to schedule emergency care.<br/><br/>Depending on the case, root canal therapy may require more than one visit. An initial x-ray will be taken to evaluate the tooth and root canal and determine the extent of the damage and infection if present. You will be given a form of anesthesia to make you relaxed.<br/><br/>When the area is numb, our dentist will create an access chamber to the root canal using an electric handpiece. Next, the root canal will be scraped of the infected or damaged tissue and nerve. Once the entire area has been throughly cleaned and polished, the tooth will be filled with a biocompatible rubber compound called gutta percha. The tooth is then covered with a dental filling or dental crown to restore strength and function.<br/><br/>Endodontic therapy has a bad reputation as being a painful procedure. With rotary endodontics, a root canal procedure is no more painful than having a dental filling placed. The infection and damage to the nerve is what creates the extreme pain and discomfort and patients you will experience significant relief after undergoing root canal therapy. Root canals have a success rate of 95% and allow people to preserve their natural teeth. | Root Canals<br/><br/>Pati doma iegūt sakņu kanālu liek lielākā daļa cilvēku uz malas.

| Churchyard Bottom Wood<br/><br/>Highgate<br/><br/>Churchyard Bottom Wood, Highgate<br/><br/>Now called Queen's Wood<br/><br/>Between 1860 and 1880 the centre was torn out of the City of London to build sewers, railways and new roads. Houses were demolished without regard for the tenants who had to find whatever accommodation they could elsewhere. Managers went to livo in Kensington and St. John's Wood, while the poorest crowded into the rookeries like Seven Dials and Lisson Grove. For those between, the clerks and skilled workmen, speculative builders put up row after row of terraced villas and Mr Pooter moved into Holloway. The people of Muswell Hill watched houses creep across the fields of Finsbury Park, up Crouch Hill and down the other side, so that by 1880, Crouch End was being developed and there seemed no way to stem the flow. Ten years later the large estates of Muswell Hill were being sold. Upton Farm was sold and the Ecclesiastical Commissioners wanted to develop Churchyard Bottom Wood, now called Queen's Wood. The story would have made an Ibsen play. Two groups of honest, highly motivated people fighting for what they each thought was right. The Ecclesiastical Commissioners on the one hand and the Committee of the Hornsey Charities on the other, both believed they were doing their best for other people, and the public rose against them both in indignation<br/><br/>At that time Muswell Hill Road was a country road, with Southwood Hall at one end and Upton Farm at the other. By 1894, Onslow Gardens was built, Connaught Gardens marked out, and builders were poised to develop the Woodlands estate. Cut out of Churchyard Bottom Wood was a group of tumble-down cottages, on a triangular site. An undated map, held by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners shows six Wasteland Cottages with an opening between them - not a road, not metalled, but a way through to the strawberry beds behind. Further along was another gap which led to footpaths through the wood. These two openings were to be the basis of the plan. The same two gaps and the cleared ground, which was the strawberry field, can be seen in the 1894 map below. They are shown as 'Muswell Hill Cottages' and, quite in passing, Peter Sellers was to live on the same site much later on. To develop the wood as a housing estate, the Commissioners needed to drive two roads through from Muswell Hill Road and build houses along them. The Muswell Hill Road frontage alone would not have provided room for enough houses to make the venture worthwhile.<br/><br/>The land and cottages had been given much earlier as almshouses to house old people and were held on their behalf by the Trustees of the Hornsey Charity Commissioners. By the 1890s the cottages were tumble-down, in need of major repair. Public-spirited, wishing to do the best for their old tenants, the Trustees could not improve them since they had no money. Some years before the Ecclesiastical Commissioners had planned to develop Gravel Pit Wood (now Highgate Wood) as a housing estate, but this had met such opposition that they backed down. Instead, in 1886, they gave all 69 acres woodland to the public. At the same time they offered to sell Churchyard Bottom Wood to Hornsey Urban District Council for £25,000, but this was too much for Hornsey to raise on its own. The Council said that people living outside Hornsey also enjoyed the wood and other authorities should help, but no help was given. In the end the offer fell into abeyance.<br/><br/>Map showing the Muswell Hill Cottages which were the centre of the controversy.<br/><br/>Muswell Hill Road about 1880<br/><br/>It seems probable that these three pairs of cottages<br/>were the ones at the centre of the dispute.<br/><br/>The Ecclesiastical Commissioners wanted to raise money for its church work in Britain and abroad. They considered that they had been given the land to be used for the propogat­ion of religion and if this meant selling off land or woods, it was a lesser evil than restricting the work of the church. They had given Gravel Pit Wood to the public: in its place they would develop Churchyard Bottom Wood.<br/><br/>The Trustees of the Hornsey Charities wanted to produce an income to help their poor people, so they made an offer to the Commissioners. Their triangular piece of land was too awkwardly shaped to be developed economically, but if the Commissioners would grant them some more land to make it into a square site, they would build twenty-five neat villas. These would bring in ground rents of £225 per annum, which could be used to relieve the poverty of Hornsey people. In return they would permit the Commission­ers to cut two roads through their land so that the Commissioners could develop the woods.<br/><br/>When this offer became known people immediately reacted with alarm.<br/><br/>On the 16th December 1893 Mr Carvell Williams MP asked in the House of Commons, if the Ecclesiastical Commissioners had consented to sell a strip of land to the Hornsey Charities Trustees on condition that an existing road be widened to 40 feet, whether this was a preliminary to a building scheme and if the House of Parliament would have an opportunity to express an opinion.<br/><br/>Mr Leveson Gower, a Church Estates Commissioner replied',"Yes" to the first part.<br/><br/>Mr Carvell Williams, "Do I understand it is the intention to destroy that portion of Highgate Woods by building on it?"<br/><br/>Two days later The Star published an article worthy of any modern tabloid.<br/><br/>The Star<br/>18th December 1893<br/><br/>'Parliament must keep a keen watch on those old vandals and confederates of the jerry-builder the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. They are always alienating some piece of land or are favouring the builders as opposed to the general public. The Commissioners would not sell the Churchyard Bottom wood to the ratepayers but now propose 'to open it up' by cutting two wide roads through it in connection with one of their numerous building schemes. Will not someone ask a question in Parliament and check the brick and mortar policy of the Commissioners?'<br/><br/>By the time this was printed, the question had been asked and the answer was either untrue, or devious. Other papers took up the story. The Times, in a long report, said that the Comnussioners were not prepared to give an undertaking that Parliament, or any other public body, should have an opportunity of considering any scheme for building on the site of the wood.<br/><br/>The situation simmered for eighteen months until the Ecclesiastical Commissioners were forced to open an enquiry, which began at Highgate on 31 May 1895, chaired by an Assistant Ecclesiastical Commissioner. The Inquiry produced a flurry of newspaper letters of which this was the most important.<br/><br/>The Daily Chronicle, 5 June 1895<br/><br/>VANDALISM AT HIGHGATE<br/><br/>Sir –<br/><br/>One of the most lovely bits of woodland in suburan London is threatened. Will you help us to ward off what would be a calamity, not only to the immediate district, but to the whole of densely-populated North London? In no part of the metropolis has the builder been more active than in Crouch End and Hornsey. The beautiful meadows of a year or two ago are now houses and shops. Ballast heaps have taken the place of stately elms and chestnuts, and once pleasant villages are sharing the fate of Stroud Green, Harringay, Finsbury Park, Highbury and Islington. ---<br/><br/>---- The object is the construction of two forty-foot roads through the woods. We in this district know the meaning of forty-foot roads through woods. It means that the woods are doomed. Ten years ago agitation saved the sister-wood of sixty-five acres - The Gravel Pit Woods - and no one who saw the Bank Holiday crowds flocking up the Archway Road from the dreary streets of Holloway, Islington and Clerkenwell, and watched the keen enjoyment of the children and family parties picnicking on the grass and among the trees, could fail to realise the immense boon that the grant by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners of this wood has been to the whole of North London, but the Lower Wood of sixty acres has always been regarded as a natural complement of the other. ----<br/><br/>--- The Ecclesiastical Commissioners own nearly one-third of the large parish of Hornsey. By the liberal expenditure of the ratepayers' money in the opening up of roads and the general development of the district, the value of their property has been enormously increased, and from this unearned increment they each year draw large revenues. Surely the ratepayers whose money has thus aided in creating the immense estate may expect liberal treatment in return. ---<br/><br/>Yours obediently,<br/><br/>Signed by The Vicar of St James', Muswell Hill, the Minister of Park Chapel, Crouch End, a barrister living in Onslow Gardens and three members of the District Council.<br/><br/>It was a shot right across the bows of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. Their own religious leaders and the District Council, all up in arms saying in effect that the church was too rich and should be charitable, not greedy. The inclusion of the two clergymen was a shrewd move. Remember to that this was still in the height of the Darwin controversy. Darwin had split belief in the teachings of the Church and many people would have resented the power of the Church from that point of view alone. The Church was not so secure as it pretended to be.<br/><br/>The Evening News, 7 June 1895 said:-<br/><br/>"If the Ecclesiastical Comnussioners are not tackled at once, the building octopus will get a grip of the wood which will be very difficult to loosen later on, ---. Therefore it behoves Londoners to be up and doing if they would save one of their most delightful bits of rustic scenery. The public inquiry stands adjourned to Thursday next, and before then something must be done to convince the Commissioners that the citizens of London will not tolerate the confiscation of one of their favourite playgrounds."<br/><br/>A letter in the Daily Chronicle the next day said:-<br/><br/>.... It was with great relief that that the residents, some ten years ago, heard that the purchase of the Upper Wood had been effected; and how delightful a boon this has proved, anyone who visited them can testify, but all who exerted themselves to save these upper woods, which lie on the west side of Muswell Hill road, felt that their victory was incomplete so long as the sixty acres on the east side remained in danger. It is, as it were, an accident that the woods are divided by a broad high road. Can anyone doubt what the effect would be if the Churchyard Bottom Wood were replaced by rows of small villas, each sending out its contribution of smoke and soot? Can anyone doubt, too, the serious difference it would make to the picturesque setting of the purchased woods if a line of staring new houses were to be run up right over against their leafy frontage?'<br/><br/>This expressed the opinions of many people. In fact, the Gravel Pit Wood, which the writer calls the 'Upper Wood', had not been purchased, but given to the district by the Ecclesiastical Commission, a point they were to reiterate time and again over the years, but most people ignored it. The Commission was not going to give away a second wood whatever anyone said, and held this position to the end.<br/><br/>H.S.Chamberlain, of 5 Cranley Gardens,<br/>in a letter to the Times dated June 8, 1895, urged purchase.<br/><br/>I know that it is common to speak harshly of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, but as the trustees of a fund they are bound to administer it to the greatest advantage, and therefore, if anything is to be done to save the demolition of the wood, it appears to me that it can only be effected by the purchase of the property from the Comnussioners, who I know, are fully alive to the protection of free and open spaces for the people, and who, I feel sure, would be disposed to treat the matter of a purchase in a free and liberal spirit, as they have already done in the matter of the Shepherd's Cot-field, by granting a lease to the Crouch End Playing-fields Company - a small company in which I own a few shares, a small company which was formed exclusively for the purpose of securing the fields for cricket, tennis etc.<br/><br/>(This refers the the Crouch End Playing Fields which had been secured a few years later.)<br/><br/>As Chairman of the Muswell Hill Conservative Association, I am constantly in touch with the inhabitants, and I can safely affirm that every person resident in the neighbourhood would do anything in reason to preserve.<br/><br/>(All he wanted personally was Charity income to support his poor people. He demanded his acre of land - not a great deal surely - he believed the Commissioners' assurance that the wood was not in danger.)<br/><br/>' Muswell Hill Road was one of the best in Hornsey and would remain equally beautiful, houses or no houses',<br/><br/>(and then came the great rhetorical flourish.)<br/><br/>'Are the poor to suffer because of the sentimental objections and the hysterical cry of 'wolf just raised by your correspondents? Something must be done and that soon. An acre of back-land added to the charity-estate would make no apprec­iable difference to the land remaining, while the profit derived from it would succour many poor old and deserving persons in their declining years and enable us to hand over to our successors an estate which in the distant future would be of great value in the rendering of charitable aid to the deserving poor of the parish of Hornsey.'<br/><br/>Reading his letter one senses hysteria very near the surface. Why did he think the Commissioners wanted to build a road? Why should they spend all that money if not to build houses? He never seemed to realise that for an acre of land the the whole wood would be lost. But he had been with the problem for a long time. He was the person to whom the Commissioners had made the offer of sale for £25,000 years before and it is his name which is honoured in a plaque on Crouch End Clock Tower for saving the wood, but his trust in the Ecclesiastical Commissioners seems naive. It is sad that at the Inquiry he was to be cast as the devil.<br/><br/>The Inquiry Continued<br/><br/>The adjourned opened in Highgate on 15 June 1895. Expecting a large gather­ing, the Council Chamber had been changed completely. The usual tables had been removed and the room filled with chairs. By half past seven the room was crowded, with people jostling for seats.<br/><br/>Mr Murray, the Commissioner, said the Inquiry was really a simple one. Hornsey Parochial Charities wished to purchase a piece of land adjoining their charity property at the back. The question was whether the Charity Commission, which controlled all charities, had enough power to stop them. The Church Commissioners were prepared to sell the land at very favourable terms and the income of the Charity would be very considerable increased.<br/><br/>Against this there were three classes of objection.<br/><br/>The original Trust was for the purpose of providing cottages for the Poor, but the trustees were proposing to build villas which would be too expensive for the Poor. However, it was within the power of the Trustees to vary the terms of the Trust, so they could build villas if they thought that the Poor would benefit in the end. The poor people themselves might object, but liberal provisions had already been promised for them. The third objection related to the aesthetic and public side of the question. He took it from what he had read that the Charity Commission ought to interfere to prevent the Ecclesiastical Commissioners from exercising their own discretion in dealing with their own property.<br/><br/>The Inquiry discussed fine points, but the speakers kept coming back to the major problem of preventing any destruction of the wood. The Vestry Clerk of Islington, representing 300,000 people, made a formal protest about any part of the wood, so valuable for the people of Islington and Hornsey being used for private purposes. Mr Wilfred White said that if the Commissioners would give them time they would be able to raise the money to compensate the Trustees.<br/><br/>Mr Beaumont said they did not want villas, they wanted cottages for poor people who were being driven out of the district. Others said that there was no money to build cottages to replace the present delapidated ones but villas would be an economic proposition. Others retorted that there were score of villas to let in Highgate. The Wood was sacred. Stick to the question of the Wood.<br/><br/>Dr Fletcher said the cry among the working people was that there was nowhere to go. Working people came to him with the cry, "We are driven out of Highgate and are obliged to go to Highgate New Town." If the Muswell Hill Road frontage was sold there was no question but that roads might be cut right through the woods in the direction of Hornsey, but if the Commissioners could not get the land from the Charity Commission they could not cut the road.<br/><br/>He was very sure the cottages could be put into a fit state of repair. He was asked by the poor people, by the police and by a number of the working classes to represent these two points, that cottage accommodation was very sorely needed in Highgate and that if they once allowed the land to be sold, there was no telling where the hand of the builder would be stayed.<br/><br/>(Loud and prolonged cheers).<br/><br/>Numerous other people spoke and the Comnussioner summed up by saying that he took it that the prevailing opinion was in favour of retaining the cottages but the meeting should draw no conclusions from what he had said (Groans).<br/><br/>Others said that the Trustees of the Charity had failed in their duties by letting the the cottages fall into disrepair.<br/><br/>Mr H.R.Williams, the Trustee who had written to the paper earlier, said that he had it on the best authority that the Church Commissioners would make no roads whatever and they would not be benefitted one iota by the actions of the Charity Commissioners. Others were far less trusting and the meeting closed after nearly three hours.<br/><br/>'We are faced with the fact that in Highgate and Muswell Hill there are a number of persons who want the Churchyard Bottom Wood and will not be happy until they have got it - while nobody appears willing to spend a farthing to pay for it. Everyone says it would be a fine thing to have the wood as open space, but everybody thinks it is the duty of someone else to make it one. The Islington Vestry has 'resolved' on the subject, but the Islington Vestry does not offer a penny piece towards the purchase. --- There is no more difficult problem for the community or the individual to solve than how to gain possession of other people's property without paying for it.'<br/><br/>Paying for it was indeed the problem as Churchyard Bottom Wood became the subject of intense local and national debate. A joint committee was formed to raise money to save the wood. On 20 November 1896, C.F.Cory-Wright, Hon Treasurer, wrote to The Standard, a daily paper at that time, appealing for help. He reminded everyone of the danger of losing the wood and said it could only be saved by buying it. The Church Commissioners would sell for £25,000 and an extra (5,000 would be required for fencing and drainage, making a total of £30,000. This was too much for Hornsey Council to raise but they had already voted £10,000 towards the total. The woods were of inestimable value to all of North London so he appealed to public bodies and private people to raise the remaining £20,000. He warned that the present offer from the Church Commissioners was open only to the end of 1898. After that the builders would move in.<br/><br/>The appeal was warmly welcomed by the press. A Private Bill was rushed through Parliament and the Highgate Woods Preservation Act, 1897, became law. The Conunittee now had the right to advertise for contributions towards buying the Wood and preserving it.<br/><br/>In a fairly short time almost all the money was raised, but the last few thousand proved very difficult to raise and the Commissioners' deadline was a matter of weeks away. Mr Cory-Wright wrote pleading for more time but was granted a mere three months and then only if interest at 4 per cent was paid for the extra period on the full sum. In the end the London County Council, which had originally offered £2,500, made this up to £5,000 and the total was reached, but it was a close-run thing.<br/><br/>The Council decided to re-name the Wood as 'Queen's Woods' in honour of Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee and Hornsey put on a fine display of bunting when the Duchess of Albany formally declared the Wood open 'for the free use of the public for ever'.<br/><br/>While the campaign to save Churchyard Bottom Wood was run and directed by local people who felt passionately about this particular piece of woodland, they called on the help and experience of a vast network of people, some of whom had worked together on similar campaigns for over thirty years. The Committee issued an appeal, printed on very good quality paper and bearing some famous names.<br/><br/>The questions of open space and public health were major subjects of the Victorian vision.<br/><br/>The Open Spaces Movement<br/><br/>Octavia Hill, the great housing reformer, who had begun with three old houses in Marylebone, bought for her by Jolm Ruskin, had quickly become an expert on housing poor people in the healthiest conditions possible. Her way was to buy leases and then knock down some of the crowded houses in order to bring light and air to the rest, believing that fresh air and sunlight were the the only way poor people could be saved from 'putrid fever. She had learnt this as a child from her grandfather, Southwood Smith, who developed his theories at the Fever Hospital at King's Cross.<br/><br/>He had built the first Industrial Dwellings for poor people and had proved statistically that good air and decent drainage saved lives. Gibson Gardens, in Northwold Road, is a direct outcome of Southwood Smith's ideas. More Information on Gibson Gardens<br/><br/>The Importance of Open Air<br/><br/>Open spaces and the opportunity to breathe clean air, were essential for people living in one or two crowded rooms. Octavia Hill took her charges from the Lisson Grove slums, up Fitzjohn's Avenue to Hampstead Heath. She so loved the Fitzjohn's Avenue fields that she tried to buy them as a public park. They were to cost £10,000 and within three August weeks £8,500 had been raised. It needed only the end of the summer holidays and the return from holiday of sympathetic friends and the further £1,500 would have been raised, but the owners suddenly withdrew their offer. Despite all pleading, the fields were covered with large houses.<br/><br/>From this developed the campaign to save Parliament Hill, the next open space northwards from Lisson Grove, buying up fields in the path of the builders to make a permanent cordon sanitalre against the advancing bricks. The Parliament Hill Fields campaign was so successful that the Hampstead Heath Bill was passed and there was money over from the appeal. From this money and the impetus towards open spaces, was to develop the National Trust. Octavia Hill had been interested in protecting areas like Church Bottom Wood for years, so she was a natural ally in the fight to save the Wood.<br/><br/>The Commons Preservation Society also, was familiar with this kind of agitation and money collection. They had torn down fencing when lords of the manor had enclosed pieces of common land, leading both legal and illegal battles against the arrogant privatization of land traditionally free. Robert Hunter, their Honorary Solicitor from 1868, was always concerned with securing open spaces, large or small, for the public. He, now Sir Robert Hunter, became the Chairman of the Church Bottom Appeal. The Chairman of the Commons Preservation Society was Mr Shaw-Lefevre MP (later Lord Eversley) who played a big part in this and other campaigns in the House of Commons. Octavia Hill had been involved in their work from about 1875.<br/><br/>At the same time Octavia Hill was campaigning for a Burials Bill.<br/><br/>City churchyards had become so full and such a serious a hazard to health, by contaminating wells from which people drew their drinking water, that City burials were no longer permitted. Instead, cemetries were created on the outskirts of town. Abney Park Cemetary was one of these. There was then a movement to remove the headstones to the edges of the old town cemetries, re-inter the bodies elsewhere and turn the cemetries into gardens and open spaces, instead of building on them. This land in the centre of London was very valuable and speculators were avid to obtain it: Even the Quakers had built over one of their cemetries and threatened to do so again by building over Bunhill Fields. Octavia Hill had a network of allies in a dozen fields, so her help to save the Church Bottom Wood must have been invaluable.<br/><br/>The Metropolitan Gardens Society, set up in 1882, had laid out about two hundred small gardens in city centres by 1890. They later handed them over to the Local Authorities, so their support for the Churchyard Bottom Wood Appeal was assured from the start.<br/><br/>The Kyrle Society is forgotten now, but in its day had great influence on Town Planning and Open Space legislation. The Society had been set up about 1875 for 'the Diffusion of Beauty', to bring colour and interest into the lives of people living in dull, drab surroundings. Bright colour to walls and decoration, good singing, open spaces, Nature, Literature and Art. All these fell within the Society's remit. There was a Decorative Branch, for whom William Morris lectured; a Musical Branch to promote choirs and Happy Evenings for people in local school buildings; and a Literature Branch. The Society appealed regularly by letters in The Times, to 'the richer classes' for books and periodicals to be distributed to boys' and girls' clubs, almshouses and elsewhere. However the Open Spaces Committee was the most active. The very name 'Kyrle' came from Pope's The Man of Ross, the philanthropist who gave his birthplace to the people as a public park. | Kapsēta Bottom Wood<br/><br/>Highgate<br/><br/>Viesnīcas pilsētā Highgate<br/><br/>Nosaukums: Karalienes koks<br/><br/>Laikā no 1860. līdz 1880. gadam centrs tika izrauts no Londonas pilsētas, lai būvētu kanalizāciju, dzelzceļu un jaunus ceļus. Mājas tika nojauktas, neņemot vērā īrniekus, kuriem bija jāatrod viss, ko viņi varēja citur. Vadītāji devās uz livo Kensingtonā un Sv. Jāņa Vudsā, bet nabadzīgākie iekļuvuši rookeries, piemēram, Seven Dials un Lisson Grove. Tiem starp, kancelejas darbinieki un kvalificēti strādnieki, spekulatīvie celtnieki safasēti rindā pēc rindu rindu rindu villas un Mr Pooter pārcēlās uz Holloway. Muswell Hill cilvēki noskatījās mājas rāpot pāri laukiem Finsbury Park, līdz Crouch Hill un uz leju, no otras puses, lai līdz 1880, Crouch End tika izstrādāta, un šķita, nav veids, kā apturēt plūsmu. Desmit gadus vēlāk tika pārdoti lielie Muswell Hill īpašumi. Upton Farm tika pārdots, un baznīcas komisāri vēlējās attīstīt Churchyard Bottom Wood, ko tagad sauc par Queen's Wood. Stāsts būtu veicis Ibsen lugu. Divas godprātīgu, augsti motivētu cilvēku grupas, kas cīnījās par to, ko uzskatīja par pareizu. Ekleziālie komisāri, no vienas puses, un Hornsey Charities komiteja, no otras puses, abi uzskatīja, ka viņi dara visu iespējamo citu cilvēku labā, un sabiedrība vērsās pret viņiem abiem ar sašutumu.<br/><br/>Tolaik Muswell Hill Road bija lauku ceļš, ar Southwood Hall vienā galā un Upton Farm no otras puses. Līdz 1894, Onslow Gardens tika uzcelta, Connaught Gardens atzīmēts out, un celtnieki bija gatavi attīstīt Woodlands īpašumu. Izgriezt no kapsēta Bottom Wood bija grupa, veļas uz leju mājiņas, uz trīsstūrveida vietā. Nedatēta karte, kas ir baznīcas komisāru rīcībā, parāda sešas Wasteland Cottages ar atveri starp tām - nevis ceļu, kas nav metālēts, bet gan ceļu uz zemeņu gultām aiz muguras. Tālāk gar bija vēl viens plaisa, kas noveda pie gājēju celiņiem caur koka. Šīs divas atveres bija pamats plāna. Tie paši divi nepilnības un noskaidroti zemes, kas bija zemeņu lauks, var redzēt 1894 kartē zemāk. Tie ir parādīti kā "Muswell Hill Cottages", un, gluži garām, Peter Sellers bija dzīvot tajā pašā vietā daudz vēlāk. Lai attīstītu koksni kā dzīvojamo īpašumu, komisāriem bija jābrauc pa diviem ceļiem cauri no Muswell Hill Road un jābūvē mājas gar tiem. Muswell Hill Road frontage vien nebūtu bijis pietiekami daudz vietas, lai mājas, lai riska vērts.<br/><br/>Zeme un mājiņas tika dota daudz agrāk kā nabagmāja, lai izmitinātu vecus cilvēkus, un to vārdā tos turēja Hornsey Labdarības komisāru pilnvarnieki. Līdz 1890s mājiņas tika nolaistas, kurām bija nepieciešams liels remonts. Sabiedriski motivēti, kas vēlas darīt visu labāko saviem vecajiem nomniekiem, pilnvarnieki nevarēja tos uzlabot, jo viņiem nebija naudas. Dažus gadus pirms baznīcas komisāri bija plānojuši attīstīt Grants Pit Wood (tagad Highgate Wood) kā dzīvojamo īpašumu, bet tas bija tikušies ar šādu opozīciju, ka viņi atbalstīja. Tā vietā, 1886, viņi deva visu 69 akriem mežu sabiedrībai. Tajā pašā laikā viņi piedāvāja pārdot Churchyard Bottom Wood Hornsey pilsētas rajona padomei par 25,000 sterliņu mārciņām, bet tas bija pārāk daudz, lai Hornsey varētu piesaistīt pats. Padome teica, ka cilvēki, kas dzīvo ārpus Hornsey arī patika koka un citām iestādēm vajadzētu palīdzēt, bet palīdzība netika sniegta. Galu galā piedāvājums iekrita uz laiku.<br/><br/>Map parādot Muswell Hill Cottages, kas bija centrs pretrunām.<br/><br/>Muswell Hill Road ap 1880<br/><br/>Šķiet iespējams, ka šie trīs kotedžu pāri bija tie, kas bija strīda centrā.<br/><br/>Ekleziālie komisāri vēlējās iegūt naudu baznīcas darbam Lielbritānijā un ārzemēs. Viņi uzskatīja, ka viņiem bija dota zeme, ko izmantot reliģijas propogatjonam, un, ja tas nozīmēja zemes vai mežu pārdošanu, tas bija mazāks ļaunums nekā baznīcas darba ierobežošana. Viņi bija dota Grants Pit Wood sabiedrībai: tā vietā viņi varētu attīstīt Churchyard Bottom Wood.<br/><br/>Hornsey Charities pilnvarotie vēlējās gūt ienākumus, lai palīdzētu saviem nabadzīgajiem cilvēkiem, tāpēc viņi izteica piedāvājumu komisāriem. Viņu trīsstūrveida zemes gabals bija pārāk neērti formas, lai attīstītu ekonomiski, bet, ja komisāri piešķirtu viņiem vairāk zemes, lai padarītu to kvadrātveida vietā, viņi būvēt divdesmit piecas veikls villas. Tādējādi zemes nomas maksa būtu 225 sterliņu mārciņas gadā, ko varētu izmantot, lai atvieglotu Hornsey iedzīvotāju nabadzību.<br/><br/>Kad šis piedāvājums kļuva zināms, cilvēki nekavējoties reaģēja ar trauksmi.<br/><br/>Carvell Williams kungs 1893. gada 16. decembrī Pārstāvju palātā jautāja, vai baznīcas komisāri ir piekrituši pārdot zemes gabalu Hornsey Charities pilnvarotajiem ar nosacījumu, ka esošais ceļš tiks paplašināts līdz 40 pēdām, vai tas bija pirms būvniecības shēmas un vai parlamentam būs iespēja izteikt viedokli.<br/><br/>Leveson Gower kungs, Baznīcas īpašumu komisārs, atbildēja: "Jā," uz pirmo daļu.<br/><br/>"Vai es saprotu, ka tas ir nodoms iznīcināt šo daļu no Highgate Woods, pamatojoties uz to?"<br/><br/>Divas dienas vēlāk The Star publicēja rakstu, kas bija cienīgs jebkuram mūsdienu tabloīdam.<br/><br/>Zvaigzni<br/>1893. gada 18. decembris<br/><br/>"Parlamentam ir rūpīgi jāuzrauga tie vecie vandaļi un konfederāti, kas pārstāv reliģiskos komisārus. Viņi vienmēr atsvešina kādu zemes gabalu vai atbalsta celtniekus, nevis sabiedrību. Komisāri nepārdotu baznīckungiem gruntskokus tiem, kas maksā, bet tagad ierosina "atvērt tos”, izcērtot divus platus ceļus caur tiem saistībā ar vienu no to daudzajām būvniecības shēmām. Vai kāds Parlamentā neuzdos jautājumu un nepārbaudīs komisāru "ķieģeļu un javas” politiku?<br/><br/>Kad tas tika nodrukāts, jautājums bija uzdots, un atbilde bija nepatiesa vai maldīga. The Times garā ziņojumā bija teikts, ka Padomes locekļi nebija gatavi uzņemties saistības, ka Parlamentam vai kādai citai valsts iestādei vajadzētu būt iespējai apsvērt jebkādu shēmu būvniecībai koksnes atrašanās vietā.<br/><br/>Situācija simmerēja uz astoņpadsmit mēnešiem, līdz ekleziālie komisāri bija spiesti uzsākt izmeklēšanu, kas sākās Highgate 1895. gada 31. maijā, kuru vadīja ekleziālā komisāra palīgs. Izmeklēšanas rezultātā tika saražots satraukums par vēstulēm, no kurām tā bija vissvarīgākā.<br/><br/>Dienas hronika, 1895. gada 5. jūnijs<br/><br/>VANDALISMS AUGSTĀKAJĀ<br/><br/>Godātais kungs!<br/><br/>Viens no skaistākajiem meža gabaliem Suburan Londonā ir apdraudēts. Vai jūs palīdzēsiet mums atvairīt to, kas būtu nelaime, ne tikai uz tuvāko rajonu, bet arī uz visu blīvi apdzīvoto Ziemeļlondonu? Nevienā metropoles daļā celtnieks nav bijis aktīvāks kā Crouch End un Hornsey. Skaistas pļavas pirms gada vai diviem tagad ir mājas un veikali.

Protams, likmes maksātāji, kuru nauda tādējādi ir palīdzējusi radīt milzīgu īpašumu, var sagaidīt liberālu attieksmi pret to .<br/><br/>Jūsu paklausīgi,<br/><br/>Parakstījis The vikārs St James ", Muswell Hill, ministrs Park Chapel, Crouch End, barrister dzīvo Onslow Gardens un trīs locekļi rajona padomes.<br/><br/>Viņu pašu reliģiskie vadītāji un apgabala padome būtībā saka, ka baznīca ir pārāk bagāta un tai jābūt labdarīgai, nevis mantkārīgai. Abu garīdznieku iekļaušana bija gudrs gājiens, un atcerieties, ka tas joprojām bija Darvina pretrunu augstumā. Darvins bija sadalījis ticību Baznīcas mācībām, un daudzi cilvēki būtu pretojušies Baznīcas spēkam tikai no šī viedokļa. Baznīca nebija tik droša, kā tā izlikās.<br/><br/>Vakara Ziņas, 7 jūnijs 1895 teica: -<br/><br/>"Ja ekleziālie klausītāji netiks galā uzreiz, ēkas astoņkājis iegūs saķeri ar koksni, kas būs ļoti grūti atraisīt vēlāk, ---. Tāpēc tas behoves londonieši būt un darīt, ja viņi varētu ietaupīt vienu no saviem visvairāk apburošs biti lauku ainavu. Sabiedriskā izmeklēšana tiek atlikta līdz nākamajai ceturtdienai, un pirms tam ir jādara kaut kas, lai pārliecinātu komisārus, ka Londonas pilsoņi necietīs viena no viņu iecienītākajiem rotaļu laukumiem konfiskāciju."<br/><br/>Vēstulē Dienas hronikā nākamajā dienā teica: -<br/><br/>..... Tas bija ar lielu atvieglojumu, ka iedzīvotāji, pirms apmēram desmit gadiem, dzirdēju, ka pirkums Upper Wood bija veikta, un cik apburošs svētīgs tas ir pierādījis, ikviens, kurš apmeklēja tos var liecināt, bet visi, kas centās sevi, lai saglabātu šos augšējo mežu, kas atrodas uz rietumu pusē Muswell Hill ceļa, uzskatīja, ka viņu uzvara bija nepilnīga, kamēr sešdesmit akriem austrumu pusē palika briesmās. Negadījums bija tāds, ka mežus šķīra plats, augsts ceļš, vai kāds šaubījās par to, kā tas notiks, ja baznīcas ēku nomainītu ar nelielu villu rindām, no kurām katra sūtītu savu dūmu un kvēpu devumu? Vai arī kāds var šaubīties par nopietno atšķirību, ko tas radītu gleznainajā vietā, kur ir nopirkti meži, ja līnija, kas skatās uz jaunām mājām, būtu jāskrien pa labi pret to lapotajām fasādēm? "<br/><br/>Ar to tika pausts daudzu cilvēku viedoklis. Patiesībā, Grants Pit Wood, kuru rakstnieks sauc par "Upper Wood", nebija iegādāts, bet dota rajonam ar ekleziālā komisija, punktu viņi bija atkārtot atkal un atkal gadu gaitā, bet lielākā daļa cilvēku ignorēja to. Komisija negrasījās atdot otru koksni, ko kāds teica, un ieņēma šo nostāju līdz galam.<br/><br/>H. S. Čemberlens no 5 Krenlija dārziem 1895. gada 8. jūnija vēstulē laikrakstam Times mudināja veikt pirkumu.<br/><br/>Es zinu, ka tas ir parasts runāt skarbi par ekleziāli komisāri, bet kā pilnvarotajiem fonda viņi ir pienākums pārvaldīt to vislielāko priekšrocību, un tāpēc, ja kaut kas ir jādara, lai saglabātu nojaukšanu koksnes, man šķiet, ka to var veikt tikai ar iegādi īpašuma no Comnussioners, kas es zinu, ir pilnīgi dzīvs, lai aizsargātu brīvu un atvērtu telpu cilvēkiem, kas ir pilnīgi dzīvs.<br/><br/>(Tas attiecas uz Crouch End Playing Fields, kas tika nodrošināti dažus gadus vēlāk.)<br/><br/>Būdams Muswell Hill Konservatīvās asociācijas priekšsēdētājs, es pastāvīgi sazinos ar iedzīvotājiem un varu droši apgalvot, ka ikviens, kas dzīvo šajā apkaimē, darīs jebko, lai to saglabātu.<br/><br/>(Viss, ko viņš personīgi vēlējās, bija labdarības ienākumi, lai atbalstītu savus nabadzīgos cilvēkus. Viņš pieprasīja viņa zemes gabalu - ne tik daudz, protams, - viņš ticēja komisāru pārliecībai, ka koksne nav apdraudēta.)<br/><br/>"Muswell Hill Road bija viens no labākajiem Hornsey un paliktu tikpat skaista, mājas vai nav māju ",<br/><br/>(Un tad nāca liels retorisks uzplaukums.)<br/><br/>"Vai nabagi cieš no sentimentāliem iebildumiem un histēriskā "vilka" kliedziena, ko tikko izvirzīja jūsu korespondenti? Kaut kas ir jādara, un tas drīz. Pie labdarības īpašuma pieskaitīts zemes gabals neko nemainītu attiecībā uz atlikušo zemi, bet no tā iegūtā peļņa palīdzētu daudziem nabadzīgiem veciem un cienīgiem cilvēkiem viņu pagrimušajos gados un ļautu mums nodot mūsu pēctečiem īpašumu, kam tālā nākotnē būtu liela nozīme, sniedzot labdarības palīdzību Hornsijas draudzes nabadzīgajiem."<br/><br/>Viņa vēstules lasīšana ir histērija ļoti tuvu virsmai. Kāpēc viņš domāja, ka komisāri gribēja būvēt ceļu? Kāpēc viņiem vajadzētu tērēt visu šo naudu, ja ne būvēt mājas? Viņš, šķiet, nekad nesaprata, ka par zemes akru tiks zaudēta visa koksne. Bet viņš jau ilgu laiku bija saskāries ar problēmu. Viņš bija persona, kurai komisāri bija izdarījusi piedāvājumu par pārdošanu pirms 25,000 gadiem, un tas ir viņa vārds, kas tiek godināts plāksne uz Crouch End Clock Tower, lai saglabātu koksni, bet viņa uzticība baznīcas komisāriem šķiet naiva. Tas ir skumji, ka izmeklēšanas laikā viņš tika nodots kā velns.<br/><br/>Izmeklēšana turpinās<br/><br/>1895. gada 15. jūnijā Highgate atklāja pārtraukumu. Gaidot lielu sapulci, Padomes palāta tika pilnībā mainīta. Parastās tabulas tika noņemtas un istaba piepildīta ar krēsliem. Līdz pusseptiņiem istaba bija pārpildīta, un cilvēki steidzās uz sēdvietām.<br/><br/>Murray kungs, komisārs, teica, ka izmeklēšana bija patiešām vienkārša. Hornsey Parochial Charities vēlējās iegādāties zemes gabalu, kas robežojas ar viņu labdarības īpašumu aizmugurē. Jautājums bija par to, vai Labdarības komisijai, kas kontrolēja visas labdarības organizācijas, bija pietiekami daudz spēka, lai tās apturētu. Baznīcas komisāri bija gatavi pārdot zemi par ļoti izdevīgiem nosacījumiem, un ienākumi no Labdarības būtu ļoti ievērojami pieauguši.<br/><br/>Pret to bija trīs iebildumu kārtas.<br/><br/>Sākotnējais Trust bija paredzēts, lai nodrošinātu mājiņas nabadzīgajiem, bet pilnvarnieki ierosināja būvēt villas, kas būtu pārāk dārgas nabadzīgajiem. Tomēr tas bija pilnvaroto spēkos mainīt Trasta nosacījumus, lai viņi varētu uzcelt villas, ja viņi domāja, ka Nabadzīgais galu galā gūs labumu. Nabadzīgie cilvēki paši varēja iebilst, bet liberālie nosacījumi viņiem jau bija apsolīti. Trešais iebildums bija saistīts ar jautājuma estētisko un publisko pusi. Viņš ņēma to no tā, ko viņš bija izlasījis, ka Labdarības komisijai vajadzētu iejaukties, lai nepieļautu, ka ekleziālie komisāri izmanto savu rīcības brīvību, strādājot ar savu īpašumu.<br/><br/>Izmeklēšanas laikā tika apspriesti labi jautājumi, bet runātāji turpināja atgriezties pie galvenās problēmas, kas saistīta ar koksnes iznīcināšanas novēršanu. Vestry Clerk no Islington, kas pārstāv 300.000 cilvēku, sniedza oficiālu protestu par jebkuru daļu no koka, tik vērtīgs cilvēkiem Islington un Hornsey tiek izmantoti privātiem mērķiem. Wilfred White kungs teica, ka tad, ja komisāri dotu viņiem laiku, viņi varētu piesaistīt naudu, lai kompensētu pilnvarotos.<br/><br/>Beaumont kungs teica, ka viņi nevēlas villas, viņi gribēja mājiņas nabadzīgajiem cilvēkiem, kuri tika padzīti no rajona. Citi teica, ka nebija naudas, lai izveidotu mājiņas, lai aizstātu pašreizējās noplicinātās, bet villas būtu ekonomisks piedāvājums. Citi atcirta, ka bija villu skaits, ko ielaist Highgate. koks bija svēts. Pieturieties pie koka jautājuma.<br/><br/>Dr Fletcher teica sauciens starp darba cilvēkiem bija tas, ka nebija kur iet. Darba cilvēki nāca pie viņa ar saucienu: "Mēs esam padzīti no Highgate un mums ir pienākums doties uz Highgate New Town." Ja Muswell Hill Road fasāde tika pārdots nebija šaubu, bet, ka ceļi varētu tikt samazināti tieši pa mežu virzienā Hornsey, bet, ja komisāri nevarēja iegūt zemi no Labdarības komisijas viņi nevarēja samazināt ceļu.<br/><br/>Viņš bija ļoti pārliecināts, ka mājiņas varētu tikt ievietotas piemērotā stāvoklī. Viņam jautāja nabadzīgie cilvēki, policija un vairākas darba klasēm pārstāvēt šos divus punktus, ka māja izmitināšanas bija ļoti ļoti vajadzīgs Highgate, un ka, ja viņi reiz ļāva zemi pārdot, nebija stāsta, kur roka celtnieks būtu palika.<br/><br/>(Skaļas un ilgstošas ovācijas).<br/><br/>Runāja daudzi citi cilvēki, un Comnussioner rezumēja, sakot, ka viņš uzskata, ka dominējošais viedoklis ir par kotedžu saglabāšanu, bet sanāksmei nevajadzētu izdarīt secinājumus no viņa teiktā (Groans).<br/><br/>Citi teica, ka pilnvarotās Labdarības bija izdevies savus pienākumus, ļaujot mājiņas nonākt nolaists.<br/><br/>H.R. Viljamsa kungs, kurš iepriekš bija rakstījis uz papīra, teica, ka viņam tas ir vislabākajā autoritātē, ka Baznīcas komisāri netaisīs nekādus ceļus un labdarības komisāru rīcība viņiem nedos nekādu labumu. Citi bija daudz mazāk uzticami, un sapulce tika slēgta gandrīz pēc trim stundām.<br/><br/>"Mēs saskaramies ar to, ka Highgate un Muswell Hill ir vairākas personas, kas vēlas, lai Churchyard Bottom Wood un nebūs laimīgs, kamēr viņi ir ieguvuši to - kamēr neviens, šķiet gatavi tērēt farthing maksāt par to. Ikviens saka, ka būtu labi, ja koksne būtu atvērta telpa, bet ikviens domā, ka tas ir kāda cita pienākums. Islington Vestry ir "atrisinājis" par šo tēmu, bet Islington Vestry nepiedāvā penny gabals pret pirkumu. «Kopienai un indivīdam nav grūtāk atrisināmas problēmas, kā iegūt savā īpašumā citu cilvēku īpašumu, par to nemaksājot.»<br/><br/>Maksāšana par to patiešām bija problēma, jo baznīca Bottom Wood kļuva par intensīvu vietējo un nacionālo debašu priekšmetu. Apvienotā komiteja tika izveidota, lai savāktu naudu, lai glābtu koku. 1896. gada 20. novembrī C.F. Cory-Wright, Hon kasieris, rakstīja standartam, ikdienas papīram tajā laikā, aicinot pēc palīdzības. Viņš atgādināja ikvienam par koksnes zaudēšanas draudiem un teica, ka to var ietaupīt, tikai pērkot to. Baznīcas komisāri pārdotu par 25 000 sterliņu mārciņu un papildus (5,000 būtu nepieciešams žogu un drenāžu, kopā veidojot 30 000 sterliņu mārciņu. Tas bija pārāk daudz, lai Hornsey padome varētu paaugstināt, bet viņi jau bija balsojuši par 10 000 sterliņu mārciņu par kopējo summu. Meži bija nenovērtējama vērtība visiem North London, tāpēc viņš aicināja valsts iestādes un privātpersonas, lai palielinātu atlikušos $ 20,000. Viņš brīdināja, ka pašreizējais piedāvājums no baznīcas komisāriem bija atvērts tikai līdz 1898. gada beigām. Pēc tam celtnieki pārcelsies uz turieni.<br/><br/>Šo aicinājumu ļoti atzinīgi novērtēja prese. Privātais likumprojekts tika steidzās caur Parlamentu un Highgate Woods saglabāšanas likums, 1897, kļuva par likumu. Conunittee tagad bija tiesības reklamēt par ieguldījumu, lai iegādātos koksni un saglabātu to.<br/><br/>Diezgan īsā laikā gandrīz visa nauda tika savākta, bet pēdējie tūkstoši izrādījās ļoti grūti savācami, un komisāru termiņš bija pāris nedēļu attālumā. Cory-Wright kungs uzrakstīja lūgumu uz ilgāku laiku, bet tam tika piešķirti tikai trīs mēneši un tikai tad, ja par papildu periodu tika samaksāti procenti 4 % apmērā no kopējās summas. Galu galā Londonas grāfistes padome, kas sākotnēji bija piedāvājusi 2,500 sterliņu mārciņu, to palielināja līdz 5000 sterliņu mārciņu, un kopējais apjoms tika sasniegts, bet tas bija tuvu.<br/><br/>Padome nolēma pārsaukt koku par "Karalienes mežu” par godu karalienes Viktorijas jubilejai un Hornsijai, kad Albany hercogiene oficiāli paziņoja, ka koks ir atvērts "sabiedriskās domas brīvai izmantošanai uz visiem laikiem”.<br/><br/>Kamēr kampaņu, lai glābtu Ķieģeļu Bottom Wood vadīja un vadīja vietējie cilvēki, kuri jutās kaislīgi par šo konkrēto meža gabalu, viņi aicināja palīdzību un pieredzi no plaša cilvēku tīkla, no kuriem daži bija strādājuši kopā pie līdzīgām kampaņām vairāk nekā trīsdesmit gadus. Komiteja iesniedza apelāciju, kas bija uzdrukāta uz ļoti kvalitatīva papīra un kam bija daži slaveni vārdi.<br/><br/>Atklātās telpas un sabiedrības veselības jautājumi bija galvenie Viktorijas vīzijas subjekti.<br/><br/>Atvērto telpu kustība<br/><br/>Octavia Hill, liels mājokļu reformators, kurš bija sācis ar trim vecām mājām Marylebone, nopirka viņai Jolm Ruskin, ātri kļuva par ekspertu mājokļu nabadzīgajiem cilvēkiem visveselīgākajos apstākļos iespējams. Viņas veids bija pirkt nomas un pēc tam notriekt dažas no pārpildītajām mājām, lai gaismu un gaisu, lai pārējiem, uzskatot, ka svaigs gaiss un saules gaisma bija vienīgais veids, kā nabadzīgie cilvēki varētu glābt no "putekļains drudzis. Viņa to bija iemācījusies bērnībā no sava vectēva, Southwood Smith, kurš izstrādāja savas teorijas Drudzis slimnīcā pie Kingskrosa.<br/><br/>Viņš bija uzbūvējis pirmo rūpniecisko mājokli trūcīgiem cilvēkiem un statistiski pierādīja, ka labs gaiss un pienācīga kanalizācija izglāba dzīvības. Gibson Gardens, Northwold Road, ir tiešs Southwood Smith ideju rezultāts.<br/><br/>Brīvdabas nozīmīgums<br/><br/>Atvērtas telpas un iespēja elpot tīru gaisu bija būtiskas cilvēkiem, kas dzīvo vienā vai divās pārpildītās telpās. Octavia Hill paņēma viņas maksu no Lisson Grove graustu, līdz Fitzjohn avēnijai uz Hampstead Heath. Viņa tik ļoti mīlēja Fitzjohn's Avenue laukus, ka viņa mēģināja tos iegādāties kā publisko parku. Viņi maksāja € 10 000 un trīs augusta nedēļu laikā tika pacelts € 8 500. Tam bija vajadzīgs tikai vasaras brīvdienu beigas un atgriešanās no simpātisko draugu svētkiem un vēl 1500 sterliņu mārciņu, bet īpašnieki pēkšņi atsauca savu piedāvājumu. Neskatoties uz visiem lūgumiem, lauki bija pārklāti ar lielām mājām.<br/><br/>No tā izstrādāja kampaņu, lai saglabātu Parlamenta Hill, nākamā atklātā telpa uz ziemeļiem no Lisson Grove, uzpērkot laukus ceļā celtniekiem veikt pastāvīgu Cordon sanitāre pret padziļinot ķieģeļiem. Parlamenta Hill Fields kampaņa bija tik veiksmīga, ka Hampstead Heath likumprojekts tika pieņemts, un tur bija nauda no apelācijas. No šīs naudas un stimulu ceļā uz atklātām vietām, bija attīstīt National Trust. Oktāvija Hilla gadiem ilgi bija interesējusies par tādu teritoriju aizsardzību kā Church Bottom Wood, tāpēc viņa bija dabiska sabiedrotā cīņā par koka saglabāšanu.<br/><br/>Arī Commons Preservation Society bija iepazinies ar šāda veida aģitāciju un naudas vākšanu. Viņiem nācās nojaukt žogus, kad muižas kungi bija norobežojuši kopzemes gabalus, vedot gan legālas, gan nelegālas cīņas pret augstprātīgo zemes privatizāciju tradicionāli brīvi. Robert Hunter, viņu goda Solicitor no 1868, vienmēr bija saistīta ar nodrošināt atklātas vietas, lieli vai mazi, sabiedrībai. Viņš, tagad sers Robert Hunter, kļuva priekšsēdētājs Baznīcas Bottom apelācijas. Commons Preservation Society priekšsēdētājs bija Mr Shaw-Lefevre MP (vēlāk Lord Eversley), kas spēlēja lielu lomu šajā un citās kampaņās House of Commons. Octavia Hill bija iesaistīts viņu darbā no apmēram 1875.<br/><br/>Tajā pašā laikā Octavia Hill bija kampaņas par Burials Bill.<br/><br/>Pilsētas kapsētas bija kļuvušas tik pilnas un tik nopietni apdraud veselību, piesārņojot akas, no kurām cilvēki izvilka dzeramo ūdeni, ka pilsētas apbedījumi vairs nebija atļauti. Tā vietā pilsētas nomalē tika izveidotas kapsētas. Abney Park kapi bija viens no tiem. Tad tur bija kustība, lai novērstu kapakmeņi uz malām vecpilsētas kapiem, atkārtoti inter iestādes citur un pārvērst kapiem dārzos un atklātās vietās, nevis veidot uz tiem. Šī zeme Londonas centrā bija ļoti vērtīga, un spekulanti bija dedzīgi, lai to iegūtu: pat kvēkeri bija uzcēluši vairāk nekā vienu no saviem kapiem un draudēja to darīt atkal, veidojot pār Bunhill Fields. Octavia Hill bija sabiedroto tīkls duci jomās, tāpēc viņas palīdzība, lai saglabātu Baznīcas Bottom Wood ir bijis nenovērtējams.<br/><br/>Metropolitēna dārzu biedrība, kas tika nodibināta 1882. gadā, līdz 1890. gadam pilsētu centros bija izvietojusi apmēram divsimt mazu dārzu. Vēlāk viņi tos nodeva vietējām pašvaldībām, tāpēc viņu atbalsts baznīcas koka apelācijai tika nodrošināts jau no paša sākuma.<br/><br/>Kyrle Society tagad ir aizmirsts, bet tā laikā bija liela ietekme uz pilsētplānošanas un atvērtās telpas likumdošanu. Biedrība tika izveidota ap 1875. gadu, lai sniegtu krāsu un interesi cilvēkiem, kas dzīvo blāvā, vienmuļā vidē.

| With Thanksgiving around the corner, here are some festive file folder games we made for the girls. Both Thanksgiving games focus on math skills. And I'm grateful once again to my husband, Ed, for making all the clipart for me.<br/><br/>Thanksgiving Pattern Making<br/><br/>Like the name says, this game is about making patterns. Little ones just learning about patterns, can simply match the pictures onto the pattern strips, while others can continue the pattern with the picture cards on the blank strips.<br/><br/>To make the file folder, you want to cut out the grid of pictures to make the card pieces. I recommend laminating them to help them last longer. Then glue the pattern strips down on the file folder.<br/><br/>I wanted to have the blank pattern strips too so that the girls could see where to continue the pattern and how many to lay out. I attached them to the side of the folder using tape so that they could fold in to pack up the game and extend to layout the pattern.<br/><br/>I also added an extra blank one so that the girls could make their own pattern as well.<br/><br/>Turkey Number Game<br/><br/>In this game the girls add the feathers to the turkey body while practicing counting and number recognition. I used the colorless feathers to act as a guide for where to add the feathers and so that the girls could match the numbers. And be sure when gluing down the turkey body you only glue in the center so that the wing pieces can slide under the body.<br/><br/>Once all the feathers are laid out, we practice some simple arithmetic, such as taking away three feathers and seeing how many are left then adding two back to see what it equals.<br/><br/>In addition to black and white wings, we also included a colorless turkey in case you want to have the little ones color their own set. Instead of a file folder game you can turn this into a craft, coloring the pieces, cutting them out, and gluing them together.<br/><br/>Another option is to use the pieces to make a felt board story. We sometimes sing a turkey version of 10 Little Indians:<br/><br/>Like this:<br/><br/>Who Am I?<br/><br/>I think this is where I'm suppose to say something witty about myself. Oh well. I'm a stay-at-home mom to three awesome kids--our twin daughters who are seven now and a two-year-old son who is full of energy. In my pre-children life I was a teacher and I now homeschool our children. I'm also married to Ed, who is currently serving in the Air Force, and is the love of my life (it'd be awkward if he wasn't). Our family is big on books, crafts, and having fun together. I just thought I would share our activities in my own little corner of the internet.<br/><br/>Zoe appears to have it all--rich, handsome husband, easy New York life--but she made mistakes in her past and those mistakes are coming back up in her new life. I found myself on the edge of my seat for most of the book and was surprised...<br/><br/>I loved this book, I love the story, and I am grateful Margot Shetterly brought it to light. My only complaint was that I wished she discussed Katherine Johnson's role in the later missions a bit more but I guess the story had to end som...<br/><br/>I wanted to like this book and I did throughout most of it. Dana finds out her estranged husband and his girlfriend are found dead in the New Mexico desert. I was immediately drawn in by her character and the story. I really enjoyed seei... | Ar Pateicības ap stūri, šeit ir daži svētku failu mapju spēles mēs, lai meitenes. Gan Pateicības spēles koncentrēties uz matemātikas prasmes. Un es esmu pateicīgs vēlreiz mans vīrs, Ed, lai padarītu visu klipkopas man.<br/><br/>Pateicības Pattern Making<br/><br/>Tāpat kā nosaukums saka, šī spēle ir par modeļu veidošanu. Mazie tikai mācās par modeļiem, var vienkārši saskaņot attēlus uz rakstu sloksnēm, bet citi var turpināt modeli ar attēlu kartēm uz tukšajām sloksnēm.<br/><br/>Lai izveidotu failu mapi, jūs vēlaties izgriezt attēlu tīklu, lai izveidotu karšu gabalus. Es iesaku laminēt tos, lai palīdzētu tiem ilgāk. Tad pielīmējiet rakstu sloksnes uz failu mapes.<br/><br/>Es gribēju, lai būtu tukšs raksts sloksnes pārāk, lai meitenes varētu redzēt, kur turpināt modeli un cik daudz izkārtot. Es pievienoju tos uz pusi no mapes, izmantojot lenti, lai viņi varētu reizes, lai pack up spēli un paplašināt izkārtojumu modeli.<br/><br/>Es arī pievienoju papildu tukšu, lai meitenes varētu izveidot savu modeli, kā arī.<br/><br/>Turcijas numuru spēle<br/><br/>Šajā spēlē meitenes pievienot spalvas uz tītara ķermeņa, vienlaikus praktizē skaitīšanas un numuru atpazīšanas. Es izmanto bezkrāsainas spalvas, lai darbotos kā ceļvedis, kur pievienot spalvas un tā, lai meitenes varētu saskaņot numurus. Un pārliecinieties, ka, līmējot tītara ķermeni, centrā ir tikai līme, lai spārnu gabali varētu slīdēt zem ķermeņa.<br/><br/>Kad visas spalvas ir izkārtotas, mēs veicam kādu vienkāršu aritmētisku darbību, piemēram, paņemam trīs spalvas un redzam, cik daudz ir atlicis, tad pievienojam divas atpakaļ, lai redzētu, kas ir vienāds.<br/><br/>Papildus melnbaltajiem spārniem mēs iekļāvām arī bezkrāsainu tītaru, ja vēlaties, lai mazajiem būtu savs komplekts. Tā vietā, failu mapju spēli, jūs varat pārvērst to par amatniecības, krāsošana gabalus, izgriežot tos, un līmēšanas tos kopā.<br/><br/>Vēl viena iespēja ir izmantot gabalus, lai izveidotu filca dēļa stāstu. Dažreiz mēs dziedam tītara versiju 10 mazajiem indiāņiem:<br/><br/>Kā šis:<br/><br/>Kas es esmu?<br/><br/>Es domāju, ka tas ir, ja es domāju, ka es teikt kaut ko asprātīgu par sevi. Ak labi. Es esmu stay-at-home mamma trim awesome bērniem - mūsu dvīņu meitām, kas ir septiņi tagad un divus gadus vecs dēls, kurš ir pilns ar enerģiju. Manā pirms-bērnu dzīvē es biju skolotājs, un tagad es mājās mūsu bērni. Es esmu arī precējies ar Edu, kurš šobrīd kalpo Gaisa spēkos, un ir manas dzīves mīlestība (tas būtu neērti, ja viņš nebūtu). Mūsu ģimene ir liela ar grāmatām, amatniecību un jautri kopā. Es tikai domāju, ka es varētu dalīties ar mūsu darbību manā maz stūrī internetā.<br/><br/>Zoe, šķiet, ir tas viss - bagāts, skaists vīrs, viegli New York dzīve - bet viņa pieļāva kļūdas savā pagātnē, un šīs kļūdas nāk atpakaļ uz augšu savā jaunajā dzīvē. Es atklāju sevi uz malas mana sēdekļa lielāko daļu no grāmatas un bija pārsteigts...<br/><br/>Man patika šī grāmata, man patīk stāsts, un es esmu pateicīgs, ka Margot Shetterly to atklāja. Mana vienīgā sūdzība bija tāda, ka es vēlētos, lai viņa nedaudz vairāk apspriestu Katherine Johnson lomu vēlākajās misijās, bet es domāju, ka stāsts bija jābeidz som ...<br/><br/>Es gribēju, lai šī grāmata man patiktu, un es to izdarīju.

| Alcohol use by persons under age 21 has been identified as a major public health problem. Studies note that it increases the risks for disability, and may be detrimental to the developing brain. Minors who drink are more likely to commit suicide, break the law, or be victims of violence. Alcohol is implicated in nearly one-third of youth traffic fatalities. The total annual cost of underage drinking is estimated at $62 billion. While most laws intended to prevent underage drinking are passed at the state level, there has been legislative activity and interest at the federal level to support states' efforts to curb the problem. This report describes the extent of underage alcohol use, recent legislative activity on this issue, and various policy implications. It will be updated as new data become available. | Alkohola lietošana personām, kas jaunākas par 21 gadu, ir atzīta par galveno sabiedrības veselības problēmu. Pētījumi norāda, ka tas palielina invaliditātes risku un var kaitēt jaunattīstības smadzenēm. Nepilngadīgie, kas dzer, biežāk izdara pašnāvību, pārkāpj likumu vai ir vardarbības upuri. Alkohols ir saistīts ar gandrīz vienu trešdaļu no jauniešu satiksmes nāves gadījumiem. Kopējās ikgadējās izmaksas par nepilngadīgo dzeršanu tiek lēstas 62 miljardu ASV dolāru apmērā. Lai gan lielākā daļa likumu, kas paredzēti, lai novērstu nepilngadīgo dzeršanas tiek pieņemti valsts līmenī, ir likumdošanas darbības un interese federālā līmenī, lai atbalstītu valstu centienus ierobežot šo problēmu. Šajā ziņojumā ir aprakstīts alkohola lietošanas līmenis nepilngadīgo vidū, nesenā likumdošanas darbība šajā jautājumā un dažādas politikas sekas. |
| Tag Archives: real food<br/><br/>Last week I wrote about the Nordic Food Manifesto, and how Denmark created a strong "real food" culture largely from an intentional effort led by Claus Meyer. It wasn't political lobbying or public petitioning that resulted in food reform, but rather a grassroots effort led by citizens with the power to actually implement and follow-through with change.<br/><br/>I ended the post alluding to one question: Why is it so hard for us to do this ourselves, as individuals? If an entire country can implement and spread a common view towards food, why can't we?<br/><br/>There's nothing really stopping us from mimicking Denmark's success. The problem is, we're inundated with so many messages about what we should be eating, and how we should be living, it's hard to know where to start. So rather than following successful frameworks that have been shown to work (like the Nordic Food Manifesto), most people jump from diet craze to diet craze, trying to find the "right way to eat."<br/><br/>But how did Claus Meyer succeed? What was the secret sauce that helped the Manifesto take hold? And is it reasonable to think we can apply those lessons to our own lives? Continue reading →<br/><br/>Share this:<br/><br/>My knife plunged into the beef with an audible crunch, pop, and sizzle.<br/><br/>"Whooaaah!"<br/><br/>I looked up at my sister as we both laughed in surprise, and continued smiling as I finished cutting my first bite. The unique outer crispiness of the meat gave way to a perfectly juicy interior, resulting in a sound more similar to slicing into a calzone than a ground beef patty.<br/><br/>We were sitting in Copenhagen's oldest pub, which felt more like a casual bistro than a bar, and I was about to try the dish recommended by our waitress/bar tender/proprietor?<br/><br/>"The Paris Beef, it's very good," she had said. "It's not from France… it's very Danish."<br/><br/>Sign me up!<br/><br/>Paris beef with fresh veggies and raw egg yolk at Rabes Have in Copenhagen | Tag Arhīvs: reāls ēdiens<br/><br/>Pagājušajā nedēļā es rakstīju par Ziemeļvalstu pārtikas manifestu un to, kā Dānija radīja spēcīgu “īstās pārtikas” kultūru lielā mērā no tīšiem pūliņiem, ko vadīja Klauss Meiers. Tā nebija politiskā lobēšana vai publiska lūgumrakstu iesniegšana, kas noveda pie pārtikas reformas, bet gan tautas centieni, ko vadīja pilsoņi, kuriem ir pilnvaras īstenot un sekot līdzi pārmaiņām.<br/><br/>Es beidzu šo amatu, atsaucoties uz vienu jautājumu: kāpēc mums ir tik grūti to darīt pašiem kā indivīdiem? Ja visa valsts var īstenot un izplatīt kopēju viedokli par pārtiku, kāpēc mēs to nevaram?<br/><br/>Nav nekā tāda, kas mūs atturētu no Dānijas panākumu atdarināšanas. Problēma ir tāda, ka mēs esam pārpludināti ar tik daudziem vēstījumiem par to, ko mums vajadzētu ēst un kā mums vajadzētu dzīvot, ir grūti zināt, ar ko sākt. Tātad, nevis pēc veiksmīgas sistēmas, kas ir pierādīts, lai strādātu (piemēram, Nordic Food Manifesto), lielākā daļa cilvēku pāriet no diētas padarīt traku uz diētu padarīt traku, cenšoties atrast "pareizo veidu, kā ēst."<br/><br/>Bet kā Klausam Meijeram izdevās? Kāda bija slepenā mērce, kas palīdzēja Manifestam turēt? Un vai ir saprātīgi domāt, ka mēs varam piemērot šīs mācības mūsu pašu dzīvē?
