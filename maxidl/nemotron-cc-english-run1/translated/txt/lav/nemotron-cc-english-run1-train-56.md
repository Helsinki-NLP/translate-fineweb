| While acknowledging that it's impossible to argue someone into loving something they hate, and vice versa, it's still often enjoyable to attempt the argument. When we talk to people whose opinions directly contradict ours, we're forced to defend our tastes, define our opinions, and analyze why we react the way we do. Which is why we have Why Don't You Like This?, in which two of our staffers will attempt to discover whether people with opposing opinions can get beyond "No, you're wrong!" and have a civil, constructive, and possibly even convincing discussion about their points of contention. Because no matter what talk radio says, there's still a middle ground between "We agree utterly" and "I'm right, and you're stupid and evil."<br/><br/>Scott: Since discussing my Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World apostasy, we've been looking for a case where I can call you out for not liking something wonderful, and we didn't have to look for long. We were sitting right next to each other during Martin Scorsese's Hugo—me, utterly enchanted by its fantastical tribute to the wonders of early silent cinema, and you, apparently resisting it at every turn. Critical consensus has been on my side: It hit the No. 9 spot on our collective Top 15 (though you listed it as your Overrated choice), has won (or placed) in various film-critic awards, and currently enjoys an 83 score on Metacritic. That doesn't mean you're wrong, of course, but the onus is on you to explain why Hugo was, in your words, "hollow and artificial," where many of us saw it as a lovely evocation of Scorsese's childhood and the medium when it was still in its infancy. And please be gentle as you rip this butterfly apart by the wings.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Tasha: I can't be gentle, Scott. Sometimes it hurts less if you rip the Band-Aid off all at once. (And even if it doesn't, who wants to walk around wearing a half-ripped-off Band-Aid? Gross.) The fact is, I found Hugo to be a wearyingly manipulative exercise in fakery, starting from its opening glide through a Paris train station, which reminded me more than anything of Robert Zemeckis' The Polar Express. Unlike Mike D'Angelo, I'm a fan of long, unbroken takes as a way of establishing a space and encouraging viewers to unconsciously hold their breaths as a camera explores an area; but when the space being explored is a slick, shiny CGI creation, and the camera floats weightlessly through it with no physical sense that either the camera or the surroundings are really there, that exploration starts to feel like watching someone else play a videogame. And the rest of the film felt similarly poreless and unreal to me, both in terms of its setting and in terms of its highly contrived, maudlin story.<br/><br/>I don't necessarily have a problem with manufactured, stylized environments in film. I loved Baz Luhrmann's equally sprawling, utterly artificial take on Paris in Moulin Rouge, for instance, but that film has a sense of its own ridiculousness, a sense of humor about how deliberately over-the-top it is. Ditto the stylization of Jean-Pierre Jeunet, particularly in Amélie. (Both Jeunet and Luhrmann felt like strong visual influences here.) I got the sense, however, that Martin Scorsese wanted me to take Hugo entirely seriously. Even though it's yet another achingly sentimental story about a plucky orphan bringing color back into the life of a grumpy old curmudgeon. And I just couldn't.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>There is nothing I enjoy more in film than being surprised. And there's nothing I resent and resist more than being overtly manipulated, being loudly told what to feel and when to feel it. A good film does this kind of thing subtly; a bad one uses crashing music cues and sweet strings—and in this case, a grubby, huge-eyed, disheveled orphan staring woefully at the camera—to demand pathos, and to tell viewers they're horrible people if they don't serve it up on demand. That said, I can deal with sad kids and grumpy adults making life better for each other—I really dug this year's Le Havre, which was essentially the same plot without all the cutesiness—but I find the artificial environments reflect badly on the artificial emotions, and each makes the other seem more fake by turns.<br/><br/>Let's start with that. In our overlooked films video, you and Noel both took Keith to task for championing Tyrannosaur, because you felt it wasn't realistic enough—too contrived, too miserablist, too much, too far. How is it possible that you can't buy a stymied old crank who breaks things when he's angry, but you can buy an orphan living inside a giant train-station clock and embarking upon a whimsical journey to repair a mysterious automaton that he believes might bear secrets from his dead father, but which instead leads him on a quirky voyage of self-discovery, into the magical land of cinema? Did you never find Hugo's gaudy rococo design, aggressive heartstring-plucking, or wheelbarrow-loads of quirk even a little excessive or hard to swallow?<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Scott: Jeunet and Luhrmann as influences on Scorsese?! Forget being indelicate, now you're deliberately poking me with a sharp stick. If you're looking for inspirations for Hugo—indeed, if you're looking for the emotional core of Hugo—you have to go back to Scorsese's childhood on Elizabeth Street in Little Italy, where an asthmatic little boy, unable to play outside with the other kids, retreated to Alexander Korda fantasies like The Thief Of Bagdad. Or, more simply, just go straight to the source himself: George Méliès, whose A Trip To The Moon remains the Big Bang of all cinematic fantasies, that moment when the camera was not used to document the world as it is, but whatever whimsical, magical, transporting place a filmmaker wants to invent for it. And that tradition has been developed and expanded upon for decades before the likes of Jeunet and Luhrmann got their grubby little paws on it.<br/><br/>And speaking of Jeunet, nice attempt to take away my rhetorical weapon, but I'll say it anyway: How can you love Amélie, yet find Hugo synthetic and "excessive" and "wearyingly manipulative"? You say that Amélie and Moulin Rouge have redeeming "sense of [their] own ridiculousness" where Scorsese means us to take Hugo seriously, and I don't think that's the case, at least on the latter point. That Scorsese feels evident passion about the movies is, I suppose, why you'd interpret Hugo as self-serious. But to me, it's those feelings that give the film an emotional ballast that the Luhrmann and Jeunet films don't have. All three films make aggressive use of the marvels of CGI—and Scorsese adds 3D to the mix, to wonderful effect—but where you and I differ is on the issue of weightlessness. I agree that CGI has a distancing effect; worlds composed entirely of digital plasticine are flexible to the point where they sometimes have no presence. You referred to Hugo in your "Overrated" entry for our Best Of Film piece as "a CGI gimcrack"—a perfect dis… for another movie.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>It's fair to say that Scorsese has built Hugo around a standard-issue, "heartstring-plucking" children's book/movie plot: Orphan misses his daddy, creates his own little fantasy world, gloms onto a new friend, convinces a crusty old fuddy-duddy to soften up and maybe adopt him. But that's just the narrative skeleton, and Scorsese provides plenty of flesh and blood. For one, you can't watch Hugo, the lonely boy, peering out from clock towers to the hustle-and-bustle of a Paris train station without thinking of Scorsese, another lonely boy, staring out of his bedroom window on Elizabeth Street. And even if you're not a big enough film nerd to make that connection, I really feel like Hugo's journey is not in finding a new father figure, but in persisting with the mechanical magic that stands as his own father's legacy. That's what film is: The persistence of vision that allows us to accept an illusory version of the world at 24 frames per second is science and magic at once. Hugo's relationship with Méliès isn't about him cozying up to a new daddy, but sharing a common enthusiasm the old man has submerged in bitterness. To me, that's a far more unique angle on a potentially shopworn premise.<br/><br/>Did you really find none of Hugo enchanting? Even the film's few detractors seem willing to admit that the sequences evoking cinema history and Méliès' studio—with Michael Stuhlbarg as the heroic film scholar!—were terrific. It felt, in the best possible way, like a heady compression of my History Of Film 101 class in college, condensing a semester's worth of clips and context into something between a montage and an animated pop-up book. And it speaks to the ingenious design of the film, which layers fact and fantasy so beautifully that it's at once a history of Méliès and the birth of cinema, and just the sort of simple, sumptuously produced cinematic wonder that Scorsese himself would have loved as a child. Thank goodness Hugo doesn't follow the Jeunet/Luhrmann model and have "a sense of its own ridiculousness." As a fantasy connoisseur yourself, wouldn't you say there's value in playing it straight and earnest and unabashed rather than winking at the audience? You may find Hugo sickly sweet, but I don't think the authenticity of its sentiment is to be denied.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Tasha: Yes, I did in fact find parts of Hugo enchanting. (Notice how I'm answering your question up front, whereas you were too busy frothing with apoplexy to address mine, though I assume that's an answer in its own right. Okay, "influence" may be overstating the case—I just meant the visual style looked very familiar. Though as Keith pointed out when you brought this up in person, Scorsese is neither opposed to drawing inspiration from other people's visuals, nor immune to it.) Primarily, I was enchanted by the parts dealing with Georges Méliès' backstory, with his love of cinema, with the work he put into his art and the joy he got out of it. There's an awful lot of beauty and fun in the staging of the underwater-court scene from Méliès' "Fairyland," and in the sequence at the end, focusing on Méliès footage. I'll grant you that Hugo's connection with Méliès over a shared love of film is a nice touch. And I do enjoy a good film about filmmaking.<br/><br/>But Hugo isn't primarily about film, in spite of the Méliès tie-ins. In addition to the themes you cite, it's also about finding your purpose, as the characters expressly, laboriously explain to each other and to us. And it's about spectacle, and big action setpieces, and chases, and happily-ever-after endings where even the angry bully and the shy older couple and fergawdsakes even the cranky dachshund all get paired off with charming love interests by the end. It's about the super-precocious Hermione Granger-type being bossy and perky and clever and praising the magical worlds encased in books. And all of this business is mighty familiar, and mighty artificial.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Yes, Scorsese is playing with archetypes. Problem is, I never felt he imbued them with anything new, fresh, or believable, in spite of his own backstory. I would have much preferred a story about a young Scorsese growing up with asthma—something small-scale and real, without vast rooms full of CGI clockwork and golden glowing dust-motes and prophetic dreams and a raging adult tyrant-guard with a heart of gold—all of that outsized, over-the-top nonsense. You keep citing Scorsese's personal background and love of film as evidence that he's really feeling what he's putting on the screen, but I don't feel his personal touch in any of this, except the moments that are expressly about film. The core emotions may be real, but that doesn't make the execution less false.<br/><br/>You say the authenticity of the emotion isn't to be denied. I don't question whether Scorsese personally felt lonely and isolated as a child, but I don't feel loneliness and isolation on the screen—I see a bunch of exaggerated signifiers (Hugo is filthy and his clothes are worn and all the adults yell at him and he regularly gets chased by a scary dog!) and big beats, with shouting and weeping and Spielbergian wonder-emoting. For me, sincerity is more convincing and more personal when it's quiet and direct; when someone's shouting his opinions at me, I assume he's either really angry, or just trying to overwhelm my senses to keep me from expressing my own opinion. Hugo was one long shout, as far as I was concerned.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Why didn't I get that sense of fakery from Amélie, you ask? Actually, I did. I'll completely acknowledge that Amélie and Moulin Rouge are both big, manipulative, artificial constructions in the exact same vein, demanding specific emotions at specific intervals, and trying to sell those emotions with heavy emoting and aggressive soundtrack prodding. Neither of them really sold me on their emotions as authentic human feeling. What I enjoyed in those two films was the construction—particularly Amélie's heady, laughable lists of random characterizing features and experiences for its cast, and Moulin Rouge's musical-magpie mashups and recontextualizations. I'm often sold on stories that do creative or ambitious things with structure, and both of those movies qualify, where Hugo is a much more linear, standard kid-quest.<br/><br/>But in the end, for me, it really does come down to a feeling that those movies are goofs, whereas Hugo is meant to be taken seriously at every treacly moment. You don't think that's true—but you're simultaneously defending its integrity in terms of its absolutely authentic, rooted-in-Scorsese's-history emotion, and telling me I'm wrong, and he doesn't mean it to be taken seriously. How do you reconcile those two statements? What about the film suggests to you that it isn't meant to be taken at face value? And is it possible this is just another Curious Case Of Benjamin Button-like situation where I find the use of kids in big-budget films to be largely sappy and melodramatic, whereas you as a dad find it bypasses your cynicism and goes straight to your family-feeling?<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Scott: Not sure I meant that Scorsese doesn't mean to be taken seriously; it's just that he's chosen a whimsical vehicle through which to express a serious love of the movies. When you say, "But Hugo isn't primarily about film, in spite of the Méliès tie-ins," I'm mystified. I grant that you find many elements of Hugo overly familiar and laborious and full of Spielbergian wonder-emoting—there's nothing I can do to argue around that perception, which other Hugo doubters share. Sometimes a film means to charm and enchant, and it doesn't for some; you've got Hugo and I've got Amélie, though I think the latter, deliberately artificial as it is, means for us to find it romantic. (Rather than, say, some horrible mechanical contraption fit for a Saw sequel.)<br/><br/>But to say Hugo isn't primarily about film? If it's not about film, then it's the most pointlessly discursive story about [whatever you think it's about] I've ever seen. The relationship between Hugo and Méliès is the heart of the movie, and at the heart of that is not just some stock connection between Plucky Orphan and Crusty Old Guy With A Heart Of Gold, but a shared affinity for engineered magic—specifically the magic of the movies. I think Scorsese and his collaborators have found a way to express their enthusiasm over the early days of cinema through a fantasy that's accessible to all ages. The archetype-filled children's tale is the merely the crust here; cinema is the pie. (Mmmm… pie.)<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>As for The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button, I don't see much of a connection, other than trying to expose me as a Benjamin Button defender as a way of damaging my credibility. (Incidentally, how are the extras on that G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra Blu-ray?) I've said to you that the sleep-deprived new dad in me was perhaps vulnerable to Benjamin Button, but I can't imagine a time when the premise of aging in reverse wouldn't move me. (Cradling the love of your life in your arms as an infant? How can you not be affected by that?) And besides, I don't see how Benjamin Button relates much to Hugo as a film concerning kids, since that's just a small segment of a story that spans a much larger trajectory.<br/><br/>So have I convinced you? Likely not. But I'm happy to learn that Hugo wasn't entirely devoid of enchantments for you. The sequences on Méliès the filmmaker are what put Hugo over for me—and in that, at least, we can share some movie love.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Tasha: Nope, I can't say you've convinced me, any more than I've convinced you. It's impossible to argue anyone into a visceral love of anything, and it really should be equally impossible to talk someone down from visceral love. Mostly, you've let me see Hugo in Scott-O-Vision, which is an interesting experience; at least now I'm mildly convinced that we didn't somehow manage to see entirely different films which both somehow had the same name and director.<br/><br/>We certainly had different experiences, though, and to my mind, focused on different aspects of the production: I still don't see the "film is marvelous" theme as the movie's single strand, so much as one among too many. "Pointlessly discursive" almost covers it, though I'd throw in "often needlessly cutesy and precious" on top of that. While you're focused on the film's tasty pie filling, I feel like that pie was covered with a pound of crystallized sugar, and I think that does make a difference, regardless of the film's core message or handful of terrific scenes. See also Benjamin Button, which I did not bring up just to chafe you—I really do think you have more of a sentimental streak than I do regarding children in cinema, especially when they're used more as symbols of vulnerability and innocence than as human characters. Hey, you know what film totally does not have cute wide-eyed moppets bringing hope to a cynical world? G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra. Maybe I will go watch those Blu-ray extras. I could use some explosion-insulin to compensate for Hugo's sweetness. | Lai gan atzīstot, ka tas ir neiespējami apgalvot, kāds par mīlošs kaut ko viņi ienīst, un otrādi, tas joprojām bieži patīkami mēģināt argumentu. “Kad mēs runājam ar cilvēkiem, kuru viedokļi ir tiešā pretrunā ar mūsu viedokļiem, mēs esam spiesti aizstāvēt savu gaumi, definēt savus viedokļus un analizēt, kāpēc mēs reaģējam tā, kā mēs reaģējam.

Pasaules atkrišana, mēs esam meklējuši gadījumu, kad es varu jūs izsaukt par to, ka jums nepatīk kaut kas brīnišķīgs, un mums nebija ilgi jāmeklē. Mēs sēdējām blakus Martin Scorsese's Hugo-me laikā, kuru pilnībā apburja tās fantastiskā cieņa pret agrīnā mēmā kino brīnumiem, un jūs, acīmredzot, pretojāties tam ik uz soļa. Kritiskā vienprātība ir bijusi par manu pusi: tas skāra Nr. 9 vietas uz mūsu kolektīvā Top 15 (lai gan jūs uzskaitīja to kā jūsu pārvērtēto izvēli), ir uzvarējis (vai ievietots) dažādās filmu kritikas balvas, un šobrīd bauda 83 score par Metacritic. Tas, protams, nenozīmē, ka jūs kļūdāties, bet atbildība ir par jums, lai izskaidrotu, kāpēc, jūsu vārdiem sakot, Hugo bija "dobs un mākslīgs", kur daudzi no mums to uzskatīja par jauku aicinājumu Skorsēzes bērnībai un medijam, kad tas vēl bija sākumstadijā. Un, lūdzu, esiet saudzīgi, izplēšot šo tauriņu aiz spārniem.<br/><br/>Reklāma<br/><br/>Tasha: Es nevaru būt maigs, Scott. Dažreiz tas sāp mazāk, ja jūs izvelkat Band-Aid visu uzreiz. (Un pat ja tas tā nav, kurš vēlas staigāt apkārt, valkājot pusi izvilktu Band-Aid? Bruto.) Fakts ir tāds, ka es atklāju, ka Hugo ir nogurdinošs manipulatīvs vingrinājums viltus darbos, sākot no tā atvēršanas, slīdot cauri Parīzes dzelzceļa stacijai, kas man vairāk par visu atgādināja Roberta Zemekisa "The Polar Express". Atšķirībā no Maika D'Angelo, es esmu ilgu, nesalauztu fanu piekritējs, lai izveidotu telpu un iedrošinātu skatītājus neapzināti aizturēt elpu kā kameru, pētot zonu; bet, kad telpa, kas tiek pētīta, ir slidena, spīdīga CGI radīšana, un kamera caur to bez svara peld bez fiziskas sajūtas, ka vai nu kamera, vai apkārtne patiešām ir tur, šī izpēte sāk justies kā skatoties, ka kāds cits spēlē video spēli. Un pārējā filma man likās līdzīgi bez porām un nereāla gan tās iekārtojuma, gan ļoti izdomātā, mauklina stāsta ziņā.<br/><br/>Man ne vienmēr ir problēmas ar producēto, stilizēto vidi filmā. Man patika Baza Luhrmana tikpat sprawling, pilnīgi mākslīgā pieeja Parīzei, piemēram, Moulin Rouge, bet šai filmai ir sava smieklīga izjūta, humora izjūta par to, cik tīši tā ir pārspīlēta. Ditto Jean-Pierre Jeunet stilizāciju, jo īpaši Amélie. (Gan Jeunet un Luhrmann jutos kā spēcīgu vizuālo ietekmi šeit.) Man tomēr bija sajūta, ka Martin Scorsese vēlējās, lai es Hugo pilnīgi nopietni. Lai gan tas ir vēl viens smeldzīgs sentimentāls stāsts par nelaimīgu bāreni, kas ienes krāsu atpakaļ veca kašķa dzīvē. Un es vienkārši nevarēju.<br/><br/>Reklāma<br/><br/>Filmā man patīk vairāk nekā būt pārsteigtam, un tur nav nekā, ar ko es dusmojos un pretojos vairāk kā ar acīmredzamām manipulācijām, skaļi stāstot, ko un kad es jūtu. Laba filma ir šāda veida lieta smalki; slikts izmanto crashing mūzikas nianses un salds virknes - un šajā gadījumā, grubby, milzīgs-eyed, sajaukts bārenis skatās nožēlojami uz kameru - pieprasīt patosu, un pateikt skatītājiem viņi briesmīgs cilvēki, ja tie nav kalpot to uz augšu pēc pieprasījuma. Tas nozīmē, ka es varu tikt galā ar skumjiem bērniem un kašķīgiem pieaugušajiem, kas uzlabo dzīvi viens otram, es patiešām izraku šī gada Havru, kas būtībā bija viens un tas pats gabals bez visas cutesiness, bet mākslīgā vide slikti atspoguļo mākslīgās emocijas, un katra no tām padara otru, šķiet, vairāk viltotu pēc kārtas.<br/><br/>Sāksim ar to.

Kā tas ir iespējams, ka jūs nevarat nopirkt stymied veco kloķi, kurš pārtraukumiem lietas, kad viņš ir dusmīgs, bet jūs varat iegādāties bārenis dzīvo iekšā milzu vilcienu stacijas pulksteni un uzsāk dīvains ceļojums, lai labotu noslēpumainu automaton, ka viņš uzskata, ka varētu segt noslēpumus no sava mirušā tēva, bet kas tā vietā noved viņu uz quirky reiss self-discovery, burvju zemē kino? Vai jūs nekad neatradāt Hugo gaudy rokoko dizainu, agresīvu sirds stiegru noplūkšanu vai ķerru slodzēm pat nedaudz pārmērīgu vai grūti norīt?<br/><br/>Reklāma<br/><br/>Scott: Jeunet un Luhrmann kā ietekmē Scorsese?! Aizmirsti būt nevīžīgs, tagad jūs apzināti poking mani ar asu nūju. Ja meklējat Hugo iedvesmas, ja meklējat Hugo emocionālo kodolu, jums jāatgriežas Skorsēzes bērnībā Elizabetes ielā Mazajā Itālijā, kur mazs astmatisks zēns, kas nespēj spēlēties ārā ar citiem bērniem, atkāpās uz Aleksandra Korda fantāzijām, piemēram, The Thief Of Bagdad. Vai, vienkāršāk, vienkārši dodieties tieši pie paša avota: Džordžs Meljess, kura ceļojums uz Mēnesi paliek visu kinematogrāfisko fantāziju lielais sprādziens, tas brīdis, kad kamera netika izmantota, lai dokumentētu pasauli, kāda tā ir, bet neatkarīgi no tā, kas ir dīvains, maģisks, transportēšanas vieta, ko režisors vēlas izgudrot. Un šī tradīcija ir attīstīta un paplašināta vairākus gadu desmitus, pirms Jeunet un Luhrmann patīk viņu negants maz ķepas uz tā.<br/><br/>Runājot par Džeunetu, jauki mēģināt atņemt manu retorisko ieroci, bet es tik un tā teikšu: kā tu vari mīlēt Ameli, tomēr atrast Hugo sintētisko un "pārmērīgo" un "dilstoši manipulatīvo"? Jūs sakāt, ka Amēlija un Mulenrūža izpērk "saprātu par savu smieklību", kur Scorsese nozīmē, ka mēs uztveram Hugo nopietni, un es nedomāju, ka tas tā ir, vismaz attiecībā uz pēdējo punktu. Tā Skorsēze izjūt acīmredzamu kaislību par filmām, un es pieņemu, ka tas ir iemesls, kāpēc jūs interpretējat Hugo kā pašnopietnu, bet man tieši šīs sajūtas filmai piešķir emocionālu balastu, kā Luhrmann un Jeunet filmām nav. Visas trīs filmas agresīvi izmanto CGI brīnumus - un Scorsese pievieno 3D maisījumam brīnišķīgu efektu -, bet, ja jūs un es atšķiramies, ir jautājums par bezsvara. Es piekrītu, ka CGI ir distancēšanās efekts; pasaules, kas sastāv tikai no digitālās plastilīna, ir elastīgas līdz brīdim, kad tām dažreiz nav klātbūtnes. Jūs atsaucāties uz Hugo savā "Overrated" ierakstā mūsu Best Of Film skaņdarbam kā "CGI žanrs" - ideāls dis... citai filmai.<br/><br/>Reklāma<br/><br/>Tas ir godīgi teikt, ka Scorsese ir izveidojusi Hugo ap standarta jautājumu, "sirds saraujas-noplūkšanas" bērnu grāmatu / filmu gabals: bāreņu garām viņa tētis, rada savu maz fantāziju pasaulē, glomi uz jaunu draugu, pārliecina kašķīgs vecs dumjš-duddy, lai mīkstinātu un varbūt pieņemt viņu. Bet tas ir tikai stāstījuma skelets, un Scorsese nodrošina daudz miesas un asiņu. No vienas puses, jūs nevarat skatīties Hugo, vientuļš zēns, skatoties ārā no pulksteņa torņiem uz grūstīšanās Parīzes dzelzceļa stacijā, nedomājot par Scorsese, vēl viens vientuļš zēns, skatās ārā no viņa guļamistabas logu uz Elizabeth Street. Un pat ja jūs neesat pietiekami liels filmu nerds, lai izveidotu šo saikni, man šķiet, ka Igo ceļojums ir nevis atrast jaunu tēva figūru, bet neatlaidīgi ar mehānisko maģiju, kas stāv kā viņa paša tēva mantojums. Lūk, kāda ir filma: Vīzijas noturība, kas ļauj mums pieņemt iluzoru pasaules versiju ar 24 kadriem sekundē, ir zinātne un maģija uzreiz. Hugo attiecības ar Meljesu nav saistītas ar viņa mājīgumu pret jaunu tēti, bet ar kopīgu entuziasmu vecais vīrs ir iegrimis rūgtumā. Man tas ir daudz unikālāks skatījums uz potenciāli nolietotu priekšnoteikumu.<br/><br/>Vai jūs tiešām neatradāt nevienu no Hugo burvjiem? Pat daži filmas noliedzēji, šķiet, vēlas atzīt, ka sekvences, kas rada kino vēsturi un Meljesa studiju - ar Maiklu Štūlbargu kā varonīgo filmu pētnieku! -bija drausmīgs. Tā vislabākajā iespējamajā veidā jutās kā nevaldāma kompresija manā History Of Film 101 klasē koledžā, kondensējot semestra vērtus klipus un kontekstu par kaut ko starp montāžu un animētu pop-up grāmatu. Un tas runā ar ģeniāls dizains filmas, kas slāņi faktu un fantāziju tik skaisti, ka tas ir uzreiz vēsturi Melias un dzimšanas kino, un tikai sava veida vienkāršu, grezni ražo kino brīnums, ka Scorsese pats būtu mīlēja kā bērns. Paldies Dievam, Hugo neseko Jeunet/Luhrmann modelim, un viņam ir "savējā smieklīga izjūta". Kā fantāzijas pazinējs jūs neteiktu, ka ir vērts to spēlēt taisni un nopietni, un neuzkrītoši, nevis pievilināt auditoriju? Jūs varat atrast Hugo slimīgi saldu, bet es nedomāju, ka tā noskaņojuma autentiskums ir jānoraida.<br/><br/>Reklāma<br/><br/>Tasha: Jā, es tiešām atrast daļas Hugo enchanting. (Paziņojums, kā es esmu, atbildot uz jūsu jautājumu priekšā, tā kā jums bija pārāk aizņemts putojošs ar apopleksija risināt raktuves, lai gan es pieņemu, ka ir atbilde pati par sevi. Labi, "ietekme" var būt pārspīlēta lieta, es tikai domāju, ka vizuālais stils izskatījās ļoti pazīstams. Lai gan, kā norādīja Kīts, kad jūs to uzrādījāt personīgi, Scorsese nav ne pret iedvesmu no citu cilvēku attēliem, ne pret to.) Pirmkārt, mani sajūsmināja daļas, kas bija veltītas Žorža Meljesa aizvēsturei, viņa mīlestībai pret kino, darbam, ko viņš ieguldīja savā mākslā, un priekam, ko viņš no tās guva. Tur ir šausmīgi daudz skaistuma un jautrības iestudējuma zemūdens tiesas skatuves no Meli s "Fairyland", un secībā beigās, koncentrējoties uz Meli s kadrus. Es jums apliecināšu, ka Hugo saistība ar Meljesu pār kopīgo mīlestību pret filmu ir jauks pieskāriens. Un man patīk laba filma par filmu veidošanu.<br/><br/>Bet, neraugoties uz Meljesa kaklasaitēm, Hugo galvenokārt nav par kino. Papildus jūsu pieminētajām tēmām, tas ir arī par jūsu mērķa atrašanu, kā skaidri redzams personāžos, darbietilpīgi to skaidro viens otram un mums. Un tas ir par briļļu, un lielas rīcības setpieces, un pakaļdzīšanās, un laimīgi, pēc tam, kad beidzas, kur pat dusmīgs kauslis un kautrīgs vecāks pāris un fergawdsakes pat kaprīzs taksis visi saņemt pārī off ar burvīgs mīlestības intereses līdz beigām. Tas ir par super-precocious Hermione Granger tipa būt bossy un iecirtīgs un gudrs un slavē burvju pasaulēm pārklāts ar grāmatām. Un viss šis bizness ir varens pazīstami, un varens mākslīgs.<br/><br/>Reklāma<br/><br/>Jā, Scorsese spēlē ar arhetipi. Problēma ir, Es nekad jutos viņš piesātinātas tos ar kaut ko jaunu, svaigu, vai ticams, neskatoties uz savu backstory. Es būtu devis priekšroku stāstam par jaunu Scorsese, kas aug ar astmu – kaut ko mazu un reālu, bez plašām telpām, kas ir pilnas ar CGI pulksteņiem un zelta spīdošām putekļu statīviem un pravietiskiem sapņiem, un nevaldāmu pieaugušu tirāna sargu ar zelta sirdi – tas viss ir pārspīlēts, pārspīlēts muļķības. Jūs turpināt citēt Scorsese personīgo fonu un mīlestību pret filmu kā pierādījumu tam, ka viņš patiešām jūt to, ko viņš liek uz ekrāna, bet es nejūtu viņa personīgo pieskārienu nevienā no šiem, izņemot mirkļus, kas ir skaidri par filmu. Galvenās emocijas var būt reālas, bet tas nepadara izpildi mazāk nepatiesu.<br/><br/>Jūs sakāt, ka emociju autentiskumu nedrīkst noliegt. Es nešaubos, vai Skorsēze bērnībā personīgi jutās vientuļš un izolēts, bet es uz ekrāna nejūtu vientulību un izolāciju – es redzu virkni pārspīlētu izkārtņu (Hugo ir netīra, viņa drēbes ir netīras un visi pieaugušie kliedz uz viņu, un viņš regulāri tiek vajāts ar biedējošu suni!) un lieliem sitieniem, ar kliegšanu, raudāšanu un Špībergu brīnumdariem. Man patiesums ir pārliecinošāks un personiskāks, kad tas ir kluss un tiešs; kad kāds uz mani kliedz, es pieņemu, ka viņš ir vai nu ļoti dusmīgs, vai arī vienkārši mēģina pārņemt sajūtas, lai neļautu man izteikt savu viedokli. Hugo bija viens garš kliegšana, cik man bija bažas.<br/><br/>Reklāma<br/><br/>Kāpēc es nesapratu to viltojumu no Amēlijas? Es pilnībā atzīšu, ka Amēlija un Mulenrūža ir gan lielas, manipulatīvas, mākslīgas konstrukcijas tieši tādā pašā veidā, prasot konkrētas emocijas noteiktos intervālos un cenšoties šīs emocijas pārdot ar smagu emocionalitāti un agresīvu skaņu celiņu. Neviens no viņiem mani nepārdeva par savām emocijām kā autentisku cilvēka sajūtu. Šajās divās filmās man patika konstrukcija – īpaši Amēlijas nevaldāmie, smieklīgie saraksti ar nejaušām iezīmēm un pārdzīvojumiem, kas raksturo tās cast, un Moulin Rouge muzikāli-burvīgo mishups un recontextualizations. Es bieži tieku pārdots ar stāstiem, kas dara radošas vai ambiciozas lietas ar struktūru, un abas filmas atbilst kritērijiem, kur Hugo ir daudz lineārāks, standarta bērnu pieprasījums.<br/><br/>Bet galu galā, man tas tiešām nāk uz leju, lai sajūta, ka šīs filmas ir goofs, bet Hugo ir domāts, lai būtu nopietni ik brīdi treacly. Jūs nedomājat, ka tā ir taisnība, bet jūs vienlaikus aizstāvat tās integritāti attiecībā uz tās absolūti autentisko, iesakņojušos Skorsēzes vēstures emociju, un sakāt, ka es kļūdos, un viņš nenozīmē, ka to vajadzētu uztvert nopietni. Kā jūs saskaņojat šos divus apgalvojumus? Kā ar filmu jums liek domāt, ka to nav paredzēts uztvert pēc nominālvērtības? Un vai tas ir iespējams, tas ir tikai vēl viens ziņkārīgs gadījums Bendžaminam Batonam līdzīgā situācijā, kad bērnu izmantošana lielbudžeta filmās man šķiet lielā mērā sabužināma un melodramatiska, kamēr jūs kā tētis redzat, ka tā apiet jūsu cinismu un iet tieši uz jūsu ģimenes jūtām?<br/><br/>Reklāma<br/><br/>Skorsēze nebūt nedomāja, ka viņu uztvers nopietni. Viņš ir izvēlējies dīvainu transporta līdzekli, ar kura palīdzību izrādīt nopietnu mīlestību pret filmām. Kad jūs sakāt, ka "Bet Hugo nav galvenokārt par filmu, neskatoties uz Meljesa saitēm," es esmu mistificēts. Pieļauju, ka daudzi Hugo elementi ir pārāk pazīstami, darbietilpīgi un pilni ar Spīlberga brīnumdarīšanu – es neko nevaru darīt, lai apstrīdētu šo uztveri, kas ir citiem Hugo apšaubītājiem. Dažreiz filma nozīmē apburt un apburt, un dažiem tā nav; jums ir Hugo un man Amēlija, lai gan es domāju, ka pēdējais, apzināti mākslīgais, lai tas būtu romantisks. (Nevis, teiksim, kāds briesmīgs mehānisks atklājums, kas der zāģa turpinājumam.)<br/><br/>Bet teikt, ka Hugo nav galvenokārt par filmu? Ja runa nav par filmu, tad tas ir bezjēdzīgāk diskursīvais stāsts par to, ko es jebkad esmu redzējis. Attiecības starp Hugo un Meljesu ir filmas kodols, un tās pamatā ir ne tikai kāda saikne starp Plucky Orphan un Crusty Old Guy With A Heart Of Gold, bet arī kopīga afinitāte pret inženierijas maģiju, proti, filmu maģiju. Es domāju, ka Skorsēze un viņa līdzstrādnieki ir atraduši veidu, kā paust savu entuziasmu kino pirmajās dienās, izmantojot fantāziju, kas pieejama visiem vecumiem. Arhetipisks bērnu stāsts šeit ir tikai garoza, kino ir pīrāgs. (Mmmm... pīrāgs.)<br/><br/>Reklāma<br/><br/>Attiecībā uz "Ziņkārīgs lietā Benjamin Button, es neredzu daudz savienojumu, izņemot mēģina pakļaut mani kā Benjamin Button aizstāvis kā veids, kā kaitēt manu uzticamību. (Starp citu, cik ir ekstras par šo G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra Blu-ray?) Es jums teicu, ka man miega atņemtais jaunais tētis, iespējams, bija neaizsargāts pret Bendžaminu Batonu, bet es nevaru iedomāties laiku, kad pieņēmums par novecošanu atpakaļgaitā mani neiekustinātu. Kā tas var jūs neietekmēt?) Bez tam, es neredzu, kā Bendžamins Batons daudzējādā ziņā ir saistīts ar Hugo kā filmu par bērniem, jo tā ir tikai maza stāsta daļa, kas aptver daudz lielāku trajektoriju.<br/><br/>Vai es esmu tevi pārliecinājis? Iespējams, nē. Bet es esmu priecīgs uzzināt, ka Hugo jums nebija pilnīgi bez enchantments. Melisas filmu veidotāja secība ir tā, kas Hugo pārņēma mani, un vismaz mēs varam dalīties ar filmu mīlestību.<br/><br/>Reklāma<br/><br/>Tasha: Nē, es nevaru teikt, ka jūs esat mani pārliecinājis, vairāk nekā es esmu pārliecinājis. Nav iespējams nevienu strīdēties par viscerālu mīlestību pret kaut ko, un tas tiešām būtu vienlīdz neiespējami runāt kādu uz leju no viscerālas mīlestības. Lielākoties jūs ļaujat man redzēt Hugo filmā Scott-O-Vision, kas ir interesanta pieredze; vismaz tagad es esmu nedaudz pārliecināts, ka mums kaut kā nav izdevies redzēt pilnīgi atšķirīgas filmas, kurām abiem kaut kādā veidā ir viens un tas pats vārds un režisors.<br/><br/>Tomēr mums, manuprāt, bija dažādas pieredzes, kas bija vērstas uz dažādiem producēšanas aspektiem: es joprojām neredzu, ka "filma ir brīnišķīga" tēma būtu filmas viens pavediens, tik daudz kā viens no pārāk daudziem. "Nepārspējami diskursīvs" gandrīz aptver to, lai gan es gribētu iemest "bieži nevajadzīgi cutesy un vērtīgs" virs tā. Kamēr esi koncentrējies uz filmas gardo pīrāgu pildījumu, man šķiet, ka tas pīrāgs bija pārklāts ar mārciņu kristalizēta cukura, un man šķiet, ka tam ir nozīme, neatkarīgi no filmas galvenā vēstījuma vai nedaudzām drausmīgām ainām. Skat. arī Bendžaminu Batonu, kuru es neesmu pieminējis, lai tikai nokauninātu tevi – es tiešām domāju, ka tev ir vairāk sentimentālas švīkas nekā man attiecībā uz bērniem kino, it īpaši, ja viņi tiek izmantoti vairāk kā ievainojamības un nevainības simboli, nevis kā cilvēka tēli. Hei, jūs zināt, kādai filmai pilnīgi nav cute plašu acu moppets, kas dod cerību uz cinisku pasauli? G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra. Varbūt es iešu skatīties šīs Blu-ray ekstras. Es varētu izmantot kādu sprādzienu-insulīnu, lai kompensētu Hugo saldumu. |
| "I hoped my daughter would be free from difficult and troubling times": Mee Mee's story as a refugee Mom<br/><br/>Hope in Times of Crisis: A Mother's Day Story<br/><br/>By Judith Santiago*<br/><br/>Mee Mee heard that the soldiers were coming. She took hold of her son and frantically joined the rest of the villagers who were running toward the Thai-Burmese border, where the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) was located. Her husband was in another village running in the opposite direction, Mee later learned. After the soldiers' pursuit ended, Mee returned home to her small village in Koechi, Burma.<br/><br/>During 1997-2000, Mee and thousands like her lived under the constant threat of violence from Burmese soldiers. Many people would take temporary refuge in the jungle, and return home to their village after soldiers left the area, just to do it all over again days later. About once a week, Mee and others would be on the move to avoid capture, rape, or death by soldiers.<br/><br/>During one incident, Mee's husband ran ahead of his wife to secure food for his family. Her husband was spotted by soldiers and shot. The bullet shattered a portion of his ribcage, leaving him severely wounded and in distress as he journeyed toward the jungle with his family for safety.<br/><br/>For three months, Mee's husband hid and moved the family with an exasperating wound at his side. He received no medical care, except for Mee's tending.<br/><br/>"I was afraid to return to Burma," Mee said through an interpreter. "I feared dying. I cried and cried every day," she continued.<br/><br/>Mee's husband eventually drew enough strength to walk five days toward a small village in Thailand where they learned the location of a hospital and a refugee camp. When Mee and her husband finally arrived at the hospital, he underwent immediate surgery and later recovered.<br/><br/>Symbol of Hope<br/><br/>Life in the jungle for those fleeing Burmese soldiers was indeed terrifying and difficult. Makeshift bamboo tents with only roof and floor coverings became suitable temporary dwellings. Many women including Mee gave birth to children in the jungle. Mee's then six-year-old son assisted in the delivery of his sister named Eh Ku Hser. Her name means love – cold – sweet. "Cold" in Burmese culture means so as to not pass through the fire of life, as heat represents troubled times.<br/><br/>"I hoped my daughter would be free from difficult and troubling times," said Mee. "I did not want her to go through what I had experienced," she continued.<br/><br/>For Mee, the birth of her daughter in the midst of darkness, torment and fear, was a symbol of hope for a new life to come. Hope in times of crisis, the very premise of the United Methodist Committee on Relief's (UMCOR) newly co-branded UMCOR-Prosperity Candle, is also the essence of that which candles shed light upon.<br/><br/>A New Beginning<br/><br/>With the help of UNHCR, hope for a new life did indeed materialize for Mee and her family when they resettled in West Springfield, Massachusetts. There, Mee met Moo Kho Paw, another woman who emigrated from Burma, and who was working at Prosperity Candle in Florence. The organization helps refugee women who have escaped areas of conflict rebuild their lives through the art of candle making. Moo Kho recommended that Mee join the organization, and Mee gladly accepted.<br/><br/>"I was excited to be out of the house," said Mee, "I was raised to believe that because I was a woman, my role was to remain at home and raise my family," she continued. "While many Burmese women want to do more for themselves, they are often encouraged to remain homemakers."<br/><br/>Today, Mee has plans to go into the candle-making business for herself and support her five children, but she expressed the need to learn English first.<br/><br/>"In the Thai refugee camp, we had education, but it was not so good," said Mee. "When I was a child, I wanted to go to school, but I was told to stay home because I was a woman. Now, I have hopes for my daughters to go to college and become doctors or policewomen," continued Mee.<br/><br/>Mee has struck an even balance in her life that she wishes others would have found—a simple, happy life where work, caring for family members and freedom of choice all have their place.<br/><br/>Support Refugee Women in the US<br/><br/>Share this Mother's Day story with your loved ones. And, when you purchase handmade candles by Mee, Moo Kho, and Naw, another Burmese refugee woman working at Prosperity Candle , know you are helping to support their livelihood as they rebuild their lives and those of their family members in the US. | "Es cerēju, ka mana meita būs brīva no grūtiem un satraucošiem laikiem": Mee Mee stāsts kā bēgļu mamma<br/><br/>Cerība krīzes laikā: Mātes dienas stāsts<br/><br/>Judīte Santjago*<br/><br/>Tas ir saistīts ar to, ka tie satur lielu daudzumu cukura, tauku un ogļhidrātu.

Vēlāk Mee uzzināja, ka viņas vīrs ir atradies citā ciematā, kas skrien pretējā virzienā.<br/><br/>Laikā no 1997. līdz 2000. gadam Mee un tūkstošiem līdzīgu viņas dzīvoja zem pastāvīgiem draudiem no Birmas karavīru vardarbības. Daudzi cilvēki džungļos uz laiku patvērās un atgriezās savā ciemā pēc tam, kad karavīri bija pametuši šo teritoriju, lai pēc dažām dienām to atkal darītu. Apmēram reizi nedēļā Mee un citi devās ceļā, lai izvairītos no sagūstīšanas, izvarošanas un karavīru nāves.<br/><br/>Viena incidenta laikā, Mee vīrs skrēja priekšā viņa sieva, lai nodrošinātu pārtiku savai ģimenei.

| The Precedency Essay<br/><br/>1562 words - 7 pages<br/><br/>Affirmative action is a government policy that gives opportunities to minorities, women, and any group who has been the victim of discrimination in the past. Affirmative action is the outcome of the 1960's Civil Rights movement, growing out of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 which outlawed discrimination based on race, ethnicity, or gender. It was the 1978 Supreme Court decision, The Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, which allowed for the use of race-based preferences as a means of fostering diversity, allowing affirmative action to be used in admissions policies. It was created with the intention to provide equal opportunities for members of minority groups in education and ...view middle of the document...<br/><br/>However, according to a 2007 report by the Pew Research Center, support for affirmative action among the American public has actually increased substantiallyin recent years, climbing from 58% in 1995 to 70% in 2007. Supporters of affirmative action make many arguments in support of affirmative action, in the hopes of getting others to see the genuine good that affirmative actin policies bring to our society. Supporters believe that affirmative action is more of a process rather than an admissions policy. Colleges and universities take the extra initiative to reach out to minority groups, encouraging them to apply. Colleges and universities offer additional financial aid and provide on-campus resources to help better the student's college education. Supporters also note the rising number of minority applications to colleges and universities due in part to affirmative action policies.<br/>Statistics have proven that when affirmative action is eliminated, such as when it was at Berkley College and UCLA in 1998, the minority student admissions fell 61 percent and 36 percent respectively, proving that affirmative action plays a major role in a minority students college admissions process. Affirmative action supporters also believe that diversity in higher education provides a better educational atmosphere for all students, personally and intellectually. If affirmative action were to be eliminated, there would be fewer minority students enrolled in colleges, causing diversity to be fairly slim. Affirmative action policies are also necessary in order to compensate for centuries of racial, economic, and social oppression. Individuals with a higher socioeconomic status have more opportunities than those of lower socioeconomic backgrounds. Supporters believe that certain racial or ethnic groups are disadvantaged because they are frequently in lower income households and consequently are not exposed to the same resources as students from higher socioeconomic classes. Advocates support the notion of competition between students based on merit, but argue that affirmative action compensates for economic differences. College graduates, who have benefitted from affirmative action, have also said that they received better jobs, earned more money, and overall live better lives because of the fortunate opportunities they received through affirmative action.<br/>Supporters of affirmative action continuously stress the severe importance of affirmative action, considering its contributions to enhancing both the college experience and society in general.

Apstiprinoša rīcība ir 1960. gada pilsonisko tiesību kustības rezultāts, kas izrietēja no 1964. gada Civiltiesību likuma, kurš aizliedza diskrimināciju rases, etniskās piederības vai dzimuma dēļ. Tas bija 1978. gada Augstākās tiesas lēmums, The Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, kas ļāva izmantot uz rasi balstītas preferences kā daudzveidības veicināšanas līdzekli, ļaujot izmantot apstiprinošu rīcību uzņemšanas politikā. Tas tika izveidots ar mērķi nodrošināt vienlīdzīgas iespējas mazākumtautību pārstāvjiem izglītībā un ... skatīt dokumenta vidu...<br/><br/>Tomēr saskaņā ar Pew Research Center 2007. gada ziņojumu atbalsts pozitīvai rīcībai amerikāņu sabiedrībā pēdējos gados faktiski ir ievērojami pieaudzis, pieaugot no 58 % 1995. gadā līdz 70 % 2007. gadā. Apstiprinošas rīcības atbalstītāji izvirza daudzus argumentus, lai atbalstītu pozitīvu rīcību, cerot, ka citi varēs redzēt patiesu labumu, ko mūsu sabiedrībai sniedz apstiprinoša aktin politika. Atbalstītāji uzskata, ka pozitīva rīcība vairāk ir process, nevis uzņemšanas politika. Koledžas un universitātes uzņemas papildu iniciatīvu, lai uzrunātu minoritāšu grupas, mudinot tās pieteikties. Koledžas un universitātes piedāvā papildu finansiālo palīdzību un nodrošina resursus universitātes vajadzībām, lai palīdzētu labāk studenta koledžas izglītību. Atbalstītāji arī atzīmē, ka palielinās mazākumtautību pieteikumu skaits koledžās un universitātēs, daļēji pateicoties apstiprinošai rīcības politikai.<br/>Statistika ir pierādījusi, ka tad, kad tiek novērsta pozitīva rīcība, piemēram, kad tas bija Berklija koledžā un UCLA 1998. gadā, mazākuma studentu uzņemšana samazinājās attiecīgi 61% un 36%, kas pierāda, ka pozitīvai rīcībai ir liela nozīme mazākuma studentu koledžas uzņemšanas procesā. Apstiprinošas rīcības atbalstītāji arī uzskata, ka dažādība augstākajā izglītībā nodrošina labāku izglītības atmosfēru visiem studentiem gan personīgi, gan intelektuāli. Ja tiktu novērsta apstiprinoša rīcība, koledžās uzņemto minoritāšu studentu skaits būtu mazāks, tādējādi daudzveidība būtu diezgan slaida. Apstiprinoša rīcības politika ir nepieciešama arī, lai kompensētu gadsimtiem ilgu rasu, ekonomisko un sociālo apspiešanu. Personām ar augstāku sociālekonomisko statusu ir vairāk iespēju nekā zemākas sociālekonomiskās izcelsmes. Atbalstītāji uzskata, ka dažas rasu vai etniskās grupas ir nelabvēlīgā situācijā, jo tās bieži atrodas mājsaimniecībās ar zemākiem ienākumiem un līdz ar to nav pakļautas tādiem pašiem resursiem kā studenti no augstākām sociāli ekonomiskajām klasēm. Aizstāvji atbalsta ideju par konkurenci starp studentiem, pamatojoties uz nopelniem, bet apgalvo, ka apstiprinoša rīcība kompensē ekonomiskās atšķirības. Koledžas absolventi, kas ir guvuši labumu no apstiprinošas darbības, arī ir teikuši, ka viņi ir saņēmuši labākus darbus, nopelnījuši vairāk naudas un kopumā dzīvo labāku dzīvi, jo viņiem ir bijušas veiksmīgas iespējas.<br/>Apstiprinošas darbības atbalstītāji nepārtraukti uzsver apstiprinošas darbības lielo nozīmi, ņemot vērā tās ieguldījumu gan koledžas pieredzes, gan sabiedrības kopumā uzlabošanā. Tomēr pozitīvas rīcības pretinieki uzskata, ka ir pienācis laiks izbeigt pozitīvu darbību. Pretinieki uzskata, ka tika izveidota apstiprinoša darbība, lai nodrošinātu godīgu uzņemšanas praksi, lai panāktu izmaiņas ilgā rasu diskriminācijas periodā. Viņi uzskata, ka politika ir novecojusi."

Skatītāji mūsu 15 apskates vietās varēja piekļūt ar aptumsumu saistītiem ekspertiem un citām izglītības iespējām, droši baudot saules aptumsumu. |
| Birthdays<br/><br/>Some people in your organisation may not wish to give you their birth date. Infoodle allows you to remove the birth year of a person! To do this:<br/><br/>When Adding a Person click the Hide Year button to remove the year of birth for the person.<br/><br/>Alternatively, when Editing a Person find the date of birth field for your site. Click the Edit button, then click Hide Year and save.<br/><br/>Easy as that!<br/><br/>Note: A person who has their birth year removed won't appear in any reports regarding an age criteria and is classed as an adult because their date of birth is actually set to 1902! The date of birth field is normally found in the information section but may have been<br/>moved under a different tab by your administrator. | Dzimšanas dienas<br/><br/>Daži cilvēki jūsu organizācijā, iespējams, nevēlas norādīt savu dzimšanas datumu. Infoodle ļauj noņemt personas dzimšanas gadu! Lai to izdarītu:<br/><br/>Pievienojot personu noklikšķiniet uz pogas Paslēpt gadu, lai noņemtu dzimšanas gadu personai.<br/><br/>Varat arī rediģēt personu atrast dzimšanas lauka datumu jūsu vietnē. Noklikšķiniet uz pogas Rediģēt, pēc tam noklikšķiniet uz Paslēpt gadu un saglabājiet.<br/><br/>Tik vienkārši!<br/><br/>Piezīme: Persona, kas ir viņu dzimšanas gads noņem neparādīsies nevienā ziņojumā par vecuma kritērijiem un tiek klasificēts kā pieaugušais, jo viņu dzimšanas datums ir faktiski iestatīts uz 1902! Dzimšanas datuma lauks parasti ir atrodams informācijas sadaļā, bet administrators var būt pārvietots zem citas cilnes. |
| Combinations<br/><br/>Combinations Are defenses against a punch, choreographed responses to different types of attacks. They have many names across the martial arts but (in my experience) every art has a version of them. This makes them different than forms because there are plenty of martial arts that have no forms. What makes there partner exercises so universal? Why practice a specific response when (in reality) timing, type of attack, size of the attacker, and a hundred other factors will make it so you never use that entire choreographed response? And finally, how can we practice for a real defense situation and avoid injury at the same time?<br/><br/>The universality of combinations is impressive, to say the least. Our style of Kenpo karate has a list of 108 combos that can be learned. (Most students only learn 20-30 though) In Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu you spend whole classes practicing arm bars and chokes, learning every subtlety to the move while your partner offers little to no resistance. Every boxer has spent hours in front of the bag and/or mirror throwing the same combination of punches until their body moves by reflex alone. Combinations are universal because we have no better way to introduce movement and then practice the subtle positions required to make them work. Hitting a small pressure point through clothing takes A LOT of practice, catching an arm bar with control requires a carefully placed hip and a sneaky setup, and a great combination is only useful if you can through it from a balanced and protected position. Can you think of a better way to gain these skills?<br/><br/>There is any number of factors that determine how you respond to an attack and whether in a sparring match or in a fight, I have NEVER used a full combination in my defense. Why, then, do we spend hours practicing them? We practice these choreographed responses because the objective is not to pull combination 8 out every time you see a hook punch but to show you one way of blocking it and then a possible way to follow it up. I have never chosen to use combination 3 in a reality situation but the block is one of my go-to moves. Combinations add tools to the toolbox they do not fix the car.<br/><br/>The last question is a question of safety. If we practice for the sake of reality we need to replicate reality. How do we prevent injury while doing so? When it comes down to it, it's about building trust. We start slow and learn to trust that we have control over ourselves. We learn to trust our partners have control as well. In more time we learn to trust our control over our partner and (a little scarier) we learn to trust our partner's control over us. In the end (with a lot of practice) you can move are full speed, tossing your partner, and being thrown without fear of injury.<br/><br/>Combinations are universal for a reason; they are practiced so they can be dissected into their parts, and we stay safe by starting slow and building trust. As with everything else in the martial arts, combinations have many reasons behind their practice and execution. | Kombinācijas<br/><br/>Kombinācijas ir aizsardzība pret perforatoru, horeogrāfiski reaģē uz dažādiem uzbrukumu veidiem. Viņiem ir daudz vārdu visā cīņas mākslām, bet (manā pieredzē) katrai mākslai ir to versija. Tas padara tos atšķirīgus no formām, jo ir daudz cīņas mākslas, kurām nav formu. Kas padara partneru vingrinājumus tik universālus? Kāpēc praktizēt konkrētu atbildi, kad (patiesībā) laiks, uzbrukuma veids, lielums uzbrucēju, un simts citi faktori dos tā, ka jūs nekad izmantot šo visu horeogrāfisko atbildi? Un, visbeidzot, kā mēs varam praktizēt reālu aizsardzības situāciju un vienlaikus izvairīties no ievainojumiem?<br/><br/>Kombināciju universālums ir iespaidīgs, lai neteiktu vairāk. Mūsu Kenpo karatē stilā ir saraksts ar 108 komb. (Lielākā daļa studentu tikai mācīties 20-30 gan) Brazīlijas Jiu-Jitsu jūs pavadīt veselas nodarbības praktizē rokas bāri un droseles, mācīties katru smalkumu, lai pārvietotos, kamēr jūsu partneris piedāvā maz, lai nav pretestības. Katrs bokseris ir pavadījis stundas maisa un/vai spoguļa priekšā, metot to pašu perforatoru kombināciju, līdz viņu ķermenis pārvietojas tikai ar refleksu. Kombinācijas ir universālas, jo mums nav labāka veida, kā ieviest kustību un pēc tam praktizēt smalkās pozīcijas, kas nepieciešamas, lai tās darbotos. Hitting nelielu spiediena punktu caur apģērbu aizņem daudz prakses, nozvejojot rokas stieni ar kontroli prasa rūpīgi novietots gūžas un sneaky iestatīšanu, un lieliska kombinācija ir tikai noderīga, ja jūs varat caur to no līdzsvarotas un aizsargātas pozīcijas. Vai jūs varat iedomāties labāku veidu, kā iegūt šīs prasmes?<br/><br/>Ir vairāki faktori, kas nosaka, kā jūs reaģējat uz uzbrukumu, un vai sparring spēlē vai cīņā, es nekad neesmu izmantojis pilnu kombināciju savā aizstāvībā. Kāpēc tad mēs pavadām stundas praktizē tos? Mēs praktizējam šīs horeogrāfiskās atbildes, jo mērķis nav izvilkt 8. kombināciju katru reizi, kad redzat āķa sitienu, bet parādīt vienu veidu, kā to bloķēt, un pēc tam iespējamo veidu, kā to sekot. Es nekad neesmu izvēlējies izmantot 3 kombināciju realitātes situācijā, bet bloks ir viens no maniem gājieniem. Kombinācijas pievieno rīkus instrumentu komplektam, un tie nesalabo automašīnu.<br/><br/>Pēdējais jautājums ir drošības jautājums. Ja mēs praktizējam realitātes labad, mums ir jāatkārto realitāte. Kā mēs to darām, lai novērstu ievainojumus? Kad runa ir par to, tas ir par uzticības veidošanu. Mēs sākam lēni un iemācāmies uzticēties, ka mums ir kontrole pār sevi. Mēs iemācāmies uzticēties arī mūsu partneriem. Pēc ilgāka laika mēs iemācāmies uzticēties mūsu kontrolei pār mūsu partneri un (nedaudz biedējošāk) mēs iemācāmies uzticēties mūsu partnera kontrolei pār mums. Galu galā (ar daudz prakses), jūs varat pārvietoties ir pilna ātruma, tossing savu partneri, un tiek izmesti, nebaidoties no traumām.<br/><br/>Kombinācijas kāda iemesla dēļ ir universālas; tās tiek praktizētas, lai tās varētu sadalīt to daļās, un mēs esam droši, sākot lēni un veidojot uzticību. Tāpat kā ar visu pārējo cīņas mākslas, kombinācijas ir daudz iemeslu, aiz viņu praksi un izpildi. |
