| Quidditch through the ages<br/><br/>I was doodling some quidditch-related objects like broomsticks and snitches and whatnot and it sort of turned into this odd compilation of things, including Harry down there at the bottom. I am not completely satisfied with the way it came out, but since it's not bad for my second Harry Potter fan-art picture, I decided to color it anyway. If you are wondering where his scar is, it's there, but it's very very light and small because I did that bit on the computer. Sketched in pen, colored in Paint. | Kalambols cauri gadsimtiem<br/><br/>Man bija jāšķērso daži ar zibspuldzi saistīti objekti, piemēram, slotaskāti un snitches un whatnot, un tas it kā pārvērtās par šo dīvaino lietu apkopojumu, ieskaitot Hariju tur apakšā. Es neesmu pilnīgi apmierināts ar to, kā tas iznāca, bet, tā kā tas nav slikti manai otrajai Harija Potera fanu mākslas fotogrāfijai, es nolēmu to krāsot. Ja jums ir jautājums, kur viņa rēta ir, tas ir tur, bet tas ir ļoti ļoti viegls un mazs, jo es to izdarīju datorā. |
| I just started saltwater fly fishing this summer and I need a new reel, so it'll definitely be the Kraken.

I'm also trying to figure out a way to explain to She-Who-Must-Be-Obeyed that I'll need to buy a new rod worthy of this reel.....<br/><br/>I've always found that no explanation is the best explanation. Don't give her a reason to ever say you're not spontaneous enough. | Šovasar es tikko sāku zvejot sālsūdeni, un man ir vajadzīga jauna spole, tāpēc tā noteikti būs Krakena.

| If you were admitted and enrolled --> yes If you were admitted and attended another school --> yes If you took extension courses (do they even have them there? I know UCLA does) --> yes If you went to graduate school there --> yes<br/><br/>That's my interpretation because any of these scenarios would fulfill either being "admitted to an undergraduate program" or "taking courses" at UC Berkeley. I could be completely wrong though, you're better off just calling them and clarifying your specific situation.<br/><br/>My opinion: Based on the wording, I interpreted it as asking if you were admitted to Berkeley undergrad, whether or not you chose to attend. If it meant admitted and attended, they could easily have seen that through the "Undergrad Institutions" portion of the application. | Ja jūs tikāt uzņemts un uzņemts --> jā Ja jūs tikāt uzņemts un apmeklējāt citu skolu --> jā Ja jūs apmeklējāt pagarinājuma kursus (vai viņi tur vispār ir? Es zinu, ka UCLA dara) --> jā Ja jūs tur apmeklējāt augstskolu --> jā<br/><br/>Tā ir mana interpretācija, jo jebkurš no šiem scenārijiem varētu izpildīt vai nu tiek "uzņemti bakalaura programmu" vai "apgūstot kursus" UC Berkeley. Es varētu būt pilnīgi nepareizi, lai gan, jūs labāk vienkārši piezvanīt viņiem un precizēt savu konkrēto situāciju.<br/><br/>Mans viedoklis: Pamatojoties uz formulējumu, es to interpretēju kā jautājumu, vai jūs tika uzņemti Berkeley undergrad, vai jūs izvēlējāties piedalīties. Ja tas nozīmētu uzņemšanu un apmeklēšanu, viņi to viegli būtu varējuši redzēt pieteikuma sadaļā “Pakārtotās iestādes”. |

| Winter Protection for Fig Trees<br/><br/>Report This Article<br/><br/>Winter Protection for Fig Trees<br/><br/>Overview<br/><br/>The fig tree has been around since at least 5,000 B.C., and is grown throughout the world for its delicious fruit. Figs grow well in a mild climate without weather extremes. The fig tree is now propagated in some areas with harsh winters. Protective precautions are required to save the tree from winter damage.<br/><br/>Potted Fig Trees<br/><br/>Ornamental fig trees in pots can stand some freezing and do not require light once they enter the winter dormancy phase. Avoid extreme swings in temperature by placing the fig tree in a controlled environment such as a garage, where temperatures range between slightly under freezing and slight above. The plant should be watered as the soil dries.<br/><br/>Shielding<br/><br/>Shielding to protect the tree from the most extreme winter weather is required. Fig trees require placement in soil areas where the soil does not freeze to protect it from disease and increase its chances of winter survival. Large screens placed around the tree protects it from winter winds that can damage and freeze the wood.<br/><br/>Wrapping<br/><br/>Tree wrapping protects the tree from cold weather and prevents hard winds from destroying the branches. Fig tree wrapping should be applied once the leaves from the tree have fallen to prevent leaves from rotting inside the wrapping material. Fig trees are sensitive to slight temperature changes. It can not warm up inside the protective film or else the tree may begin to grow, making it susceptible to severe damage during the cold snap.<br/><br/>Planting<br/><br/>Cultivar practices help to protect the fig tree during harsh winters. Varieties that are resistant to cold weather are best for locations where the weathers are harsh. Brown Turkey, Brunswick and Blue Celeste are good cultivars for cold weather. Planting should be done against a wall or structure that will radiate heat towards the tree during the winter months.<br/><br/>Snow<br/><br/>Roots of the fig tree require dry soil during the winter dormancy period. Watering should be done only when the soil is dry and the roots should be protected from melting snow and rain. Protection placed on the ground under the tree, near the trunk--to keep water from draining into the soil--protects the tree from damage.<br/><br/>Keywords:<br/>fig tree protection, fig tree winter, fig tree care | Fig Trees ziemas aizsardzība<br/><br/>Ziņot par šo rakstu<br/><br/>Fig Trees ziemas aizsardzība<br/><br/>Pārskats<br/><br/>Vīģes koks ir bijis aptuveni kopš vismaz 5000 BC, un tiek audzēts visā pasaulē, lai tās garšīgi augļi.

| Oculus CEO comes down hard on Mac support for the Rift<br/><br/>Oculus CEO, Palmer Luckey, has not minced his words when asked in an interview whether the Rift VR headset will ever support the Mac. If you had any hopes of it being soon, you might want to ready yourselves for some disappointment.<br/><br/>That is up to Apple. If they ever release a good computer, we will do it.<br/><br/>What he's referring to there in a less diplomatic sense is the discrete graphics required to run the Rift. The simple truth is that Apple just doesn't go for high-end graphics that will meet the requirements for the headset. For context, on a Windows PC, you need a minimum of an NVIDIA GTX 970, a $300 graphics card.<br/><br/>As Luckey went on to say:<br/><br/>It just boils down to the fact that Apple doesn't prioritize high-end GPUs. You can buy a $6,000 Mac Pro with the top of the line AMD FirePro D700, and it still doesn't match our recommended specs. So if they prioritize higher-end GPUs like they used to for a while back in the day, we'd love to support Mac. But right now, there's just not a single machine out there that supports it.<br/><br/>The Mac Pro can't be accused of not packing plenty of horsepower, because it does, but equally FirePro graphics are targeted more towards the creative market, just like the Mac Pro. The Mac Pro in particular far exceeds other hardware requirements, but naturally as the Rift is graphics heavy, this is where the shortfall is. Luckey is perhaps being a little over the top, but equally he's the man behind the Rift, so there's no doubts plenty of truth to what he says. Even if he doesn't say it particularly well.<br/><br/>What say you, Mac owners of the world? Are you even bothered about the Oculus Rift or is it something you wish you could have? Sound off in the comments below!<br/><br/>Reader comments<br/><br/>Oculus CEO comes down hard on Mac support for the Rift<br/><br/>No, not bothered by it since I really wasn't planning on buying an Oculus Rift. For me the product category is still too early and too much in a beta-kinda phase. But he does rise a valid point. Apple should try to get more ahead of the pack CPU/GPU wise. Right now they're always trailing behind.<br/><br/>Excuse me, but what is HTC Vive better at? And Oculus Rift most certainly supports Linux machines that meet their hardware specifications! (The issue is not OS but hardware.)<br/><br/>Also, look at WHY the HTC Vive supports OS X: it includes more of its own hardware. (Which is why it costs so much.) The Oculus solutions - both the Rift and the Samsung Gear VR - require the hardware that it is plugging into to perform more of the heavy lifting.<br/><br/>VR isn't a gimmick. 3D TVs don't always give that much of a 3d effect, and it doesn't work with everyone. VR works with everyone, and the Oculus and HTC Vive official release products have almost no latency so there shoudn't be any motion sickness. There's also plenty of game support<br/><br/>Obviously if gaming is a priority you're generally not in the market for a Mac, though. Not many game developers support OSX so these types of devices likely have limited use on a Mac (for gaming, anyways, which the Rift was designed for). At least that's the only reason I could see myself using one. I definitely wouldn't use it for watching movies.<br/><br/>Apple did implement the Metal engine into El Capitan, there might be some plan to go into the gaming market (as Apple learned from iOS how big this market is, just look at the top grossing apps).<br/>So now the hardware is missing and and game devs would probably show some interest, since Macs there are now an acceptable amount of Mac users around the world.<br/><br/>I would like to see Apple make its way into that sector of the industry. I don't use any Apple products presently but they're making a lot of the right moves in many areas and I'm very intrigued.<br/><br/>Plus, competition fuels innovation. I know that major computer part manufactures already create that competition but Apple has the RnD willpower and the cash to really turn heads. They may not win the numbers games in terms of specs, they actually rarely do, but most people who care to do the research know that performance != the sum of the device's parts. Apple can do more with "less". On paper their products appear inferior but when carefully balanced hardware meets specifically engineered software they generally perform just as well as the competition if not out perform.<br/><br/>HA! I love how, all of a sudden, having a high performance computer is not important to Apple phans! There is not a single Mac capable of the highest end graphics. Can't buy one, can't build one. Mac is not capable of being the highest in performance and you are good with that. HA! Classic!<br/><br/>I bought my MacBook Pro Retina in 2012 because of the high resolution screen and the non-discrete GPU. However, for my desktop I built a system with a 4K monitor, i7 4790K CPU, 3 GTX 970 GPU's, and 16 gb of memory all for less than what I'd pay for an iMac. I even have an SSD set up to boot in OSX. My point is Apple could do similar things if it wished, but doesn't. In fact, look at the most recent iMac. It includes discrete graphics and a slow 5400 RPM drive. My computer may not look as pretty, and it's not as thin, but in the end it's more useful - isn't that why we buy a computer in the first place?<br/><br/>I don't see why a Mac pro can not make use of the Oculus isn't it built for rendering video. I understand that it will not be able to run on iMac's and because of this the Oculus should be branded for Pro users due to the requirements and come at the price.<br/><br/>Now people are saying that your computer is doing ALL the heavy lifting, so why is the price point over $800 for something that isn't doing anything?<br/><br/>I'm excited about the direction of VR but not where it is at the moment.<br/><br/>Your display (which the Rift is) never does any of the heavy lifting. It's $800 because of what the display does; 110° viewing angle (still not human eye but much closer than other displays) with super low latency to reduce or eliminate motion sickness on a 1200x1800 per eye display for HD quality.<br/><br/>And yes, Mac's are very widely used for video rendering, but that rendering doesn't happen at 30+fps. It can take video rendering machines hours to render a single frame and sometimes years to render an entire movie. The final products, or pre-rendered material, is what then becomes 30+fps.<br/><br/>Thank you @TheRealFixxer<br/>Alot of what you say makes sense and some I was unaware of.<br/><br/>I guess I don't see VR as a game, but as an immersion and seeing Mac's are good at 3dcad and compiling video I would think they would be able to compile a scene well. I've even seen 3d renders of movie walk through. Creating a 3d world and placing cameras in areas to figure out how a scene would look<br/><br/>But I agree Mac's make more use of CPU cycles even by using there GPU's to help. WIth that said there are other directions one could take it. Like external thunderbolt video cards.<br/><br/>My big grip is the fact Octulas is looked at as a consumer product. If the requirements are that high, then it's more a pro product and needs to be advertized as that. I understand the technology is there but don't feel it's there to call it a consumer product.<br/><br/>Yes, you are right. Apple also has issues with software. Most aren't using "metal" the apple programming language which speeds up the processing for games because it's an Apple only solution where many use game engines that work on Microsoft Direct X or open source Opengl which most games use to run on Linux and oSX. Opengl is around 20% slower and sometime a lot more than that compared to direct x so a top of the line gaming card running in oSX runs as fast is a mid level gaming card in windows. So big problems not to mention most macs have built in cards that have no upgradability.<br/><br/>The mac pro is so different that Apple would have to do this as it wouldn't be worth a card vendor doing this as there is no profit in it for them with the small amount of possible buyers there would be for this. Apple doesn't like to loose money so I don't see this ever happening. Apple would loose money offering video card upgrades for mac pros.<br/><br/>Well he has a point though I do t care about oculus rift, rather wait for starVR. There should be an option to add better GPUs into an iMac and MacBook Pro. It is also sad that there is no more nVidia card, I liked the CUDA support now I will have to buy a PC and install Linux for my CUDA projects.<br/><br/>Gaming is a growing market and it won't be long until even iPhones have more GPU performance than the Macs. I agree that Apple should offer a high end GPU in a Mac<br/><br/>I am very bothered by the lack of high performance discrete graphics on Mac computers. Even the top of the like iMac uses an out of date mobile GPU which, of course, cannot be upgraded. If I want to develop software for VR, Apple has left me no choice but to buy or build a PC to run it on. As a big Apple fan (yes I admit it) this make me rather sad.<br/><br/>BTW, VR is not some passing fad. If you have tried it you know what I mean. VR is going to change gaming and content creation forever. My only worry about VR is that is too good. There could be millions of people that will become addicted to living and playing in virtual worlds. Look at how many people got addicted to MMOs that played on a flat screen. With VR you really feel like you are in the game.<br/><br/>Not worried about anything, i am pretty sure apple will have its own implementation for Mac and iOS when tech will be ready for consumers, right now it is more for hardcore users. Like always apple like to time its presence on right time, with right product. Have faith in apple.<br/><br/>It's funny that a lot of people know which vr is better based on os support. I guess you guys did heavy testing and now are the guy in the big electronic store that knows best.<br/><br/>HTC said it will bring support to the osx but that still needs to be seen.<br/><br/>I understand that a lot of you guys are stamped on there d**ks. But understand that Apple is more focused on laptops. And laptops can't be packed with more power than a PC, due to size, heat, power consumption etc.<br/><br/>He is right, even though he put it in **** terms. I love my Mac but Lord it needs a boost in graphics. Not that it needs to cost more but I would be more than willing to pay a little extra for a better graphics card or at least have the option to install my own. It's really too bad this guy had to make his statement sound like he is just plain uneducated. | Oculus CEO nāk uz leju grūti par Mac atbalstu Rift<br/><br/>Oculus CEO, Palmer Luckey, nav malto savus vārdus, kad jautāja intervijā, vai Rift VR austiņas kādreiz atbalstīs Mac. Ja jums bija kādas cerības, ka tas drīz, jūs varētu vēlēties, lai sagatavotos sev kādu vilšanos.<br/><br/>Tas ir atkarīgs no Apple. Ja viņi kādreiz izlaidīs labu datoru, mēs to darīsim.<br/><br/>Tas, ko viņš atsaucas uz to mazāk diplomātiskā nozīmē, ir diskrēta grafika, kas nepieciešama, lai palaistu Riftu. Vienkārša patiesība ir tāda, ka Apple vienkārši neveic augstas klases grafiku, kas atbilst austiņām izvirzītajām prasībām. Kontekstā, Windows PC, jums ir nepieciešams vismaz NVIDIA GTX 970, 300 $ grafikas karti.<br/><br/>Kā Luckey turpināja teikt:<br/><br/>Tas ir atkarīgs tikai no tā, ka Apple nepiešķir prioritāti augstas klases GPU. Jūs varat iegādāties $ 6,000 Mac Pro ar līnijas AMD FirePro D700 augšdaļu, un tas joprojām neatbilst mūsu ieteiktajām specifikācijām. Tātad, ja viņi piešķir prioritāti augstākās klases GPU, piemēram, viņi kādreiz, bet atpakaļ dienā, mēs labprāt atbalstītu Mac. Bet tagad, tur vienkārši nav viena mašīna, kas tur, kas to atbalsta.<br/><br/>Mac Pro nevar pārmest, ka tajā nav daudz zirgspēku, jo tas tā ir, bet tikpat FirePro grafika ir vairāk vērsta uz radošo tirgu, tāpat kā Mac Pro. Mac Pro ievērojami pārsniedz citas aparatūras prasības, bet, protams, tā kā Rift ir grafikas smags, tas ir tur, kur trūkst. Luckey, iespējams, ir nedaudz virs augšas, bet tikpat viņš ir cilvēks aiz Rifta, tāpēc nav šaubu daudz patiesības, ko viņš saka. Pat ja viņš to nesaka īpaši labi.<br/><br/>Ko jūs sakāt, Mac īpašniekiem pasaulē? Vai jūs pat bothered par Oculus plaisa, vai tas ir kaut kas jums vēlas, jūs varētu būt? Skaņa pie komentārus zemāk!<br/><br/>Lasītāja komentāri<br/><br/>Oculus CEO nāk uz leju grūti par Mac atbalstu Rift<br/><br/>Nē, tas neuztraucas, jo es patiešām neplānoju iegādāties Oculus Rift. Man produktu kategorija joprojām ir pārāk agri un pārāk daudz beta-kinda fāzē. Bet viņš palielina derīgu punktu. Apple vajadzētu mēģināt iegūt vairāk pirms iepakojuma CPU / GPU gudrs. Šobrīd viņi vienmēr atpaliek.<br/><br/>Atvainojiet, bet kas ir HTC Vive labāk? Un Oculus Rift visvairāk noteikti atbalsta Linux mašīnas, kas atbilst to aparatūras specifikācijām! (Problēma nav OS, bet aparatūra.)<br/><br/>Arī apskatīt KĀPĒC HTC Vive atbalsta OS X: tas ietver vairāk par savu aparatūru. (Kas ir iemesls, kāpēc tas maksā tik daudz.) Oculus risinājumi - gan Rift, gan Samsung Gear VR - prasa aparatūru, kurā tas ir pieslēgts, lai veiktu vairāk smago celšanas.<br/><br/>VR nav triks. 3D televizori ne vienmēr dod tik daudz 3d efekta, un tas nedarbojas ar visiem. VR darbojas ar visiem, un Oculus un HTC Vive oficiālajiem izlaides produktiem nav gandrīz latentuma, tāpēc nav kustības slimības. Ir arī daudz spēļu atbalsta<br/><br/>Acīmredzot, ja spēļu ir prioritāte jūs parasti nav tirgū Mac, lai gan. Ne daudzi spēļu izstrādātāji atbalsta OSX, lai šāda veida ierīcēm, iespējams, ir ierobežota izmantošana uz Mac (spēļu, anyways, kas Rift bija paredzēts). Vismaz tas ir vienīgais iemesls, kāpēc es varētu redzēt sevi, izmantojot vienu. Es noteikti to neizmantotu, lai skatītos filmas.<br/><br/>Apple nebija ieviest metāla dzinēju uz El Capitan, tur varētu būt daži plāns iedziļināties spēļu tirgū (kā Apple uzzināja no iOS, cik liels šis tirgus ir, paskatieties uz top ekstrapolācijas progr).<br/>Tāpēc tagad aparatūras trūkst un un spēļu devs, iespējams, parādītu zināmu interesi, jo Mac tagad ir pieņemams daudzums Mac lietotājiem visā pasaulē.<br/><br/>Es gribētu redzēt Apple padarīt savu ceļu uz šo nozari nozarē. Es nelietoju Apple produktus pašlaik, bet viņi dara daudz pareizos soļus daudzās jomās, un es esmu ļoti intriģēts.<br/><br/>Plus, konkurence veicina jauninājumus. Es zinu, ka galvenās datoru daļas jau rada šo konkurenci, bet Apple ir RnD gribasspēks un nauda, lai patiešām pagrieztu galvu. Viņi nevar uzvarēt numurus spēles ziņā specs, viņi tiešām reti dara, bet lielākā daļa cilvēku, kas rūpējas par to, lai veiktu pētījumu, zina, ka veiktspēju ! = summa ierīces daļas. Apple var darīt vairāk ar "mazāk". Uz papīra viņu produkti šķiet sliktāki, bet, kad rūpīgi sabalansēta aparatūra atbilst īpaši inženierijas programmatūru tie parasti veic tikpat labi kā konkurence, ja ne veic.<br/><br/>HA! Man patīk, kā, pēkšņi, kam ir augstas veiktspējas dators nav svarīgi, lai Apple phans! Nav neviena Mac spēj augstāko gala grafikas. Nevar nopirkt vienu, nevar veidot vienu. Mac nav spējīgs būt augstākais sniegums, un jums ir labi ar to. HA! Classic!<br/><br/>Es nopirku savu MacBook Pro Retina 2012 sakarā ar augstas izšķirtspējas ekrānu un nediskrētu GPU. Tomēr manai darbvirsmai es izveidoju sistēmu ar 4K monitoru, i7 4790K CPU, 3 GTX 970 GPU un 16 gb atmiņu par mazāk nekā to, ko es maksātu par iMac. Man pat ir iestatīts SSD, lai sāktu OSX. Mans jautājums ir Apple varētu darīt līdzīgas lietas, ja tas vēlētos, bet to nedara. Patiesībā apskatiet jaunāko iMac. Tas ietver diskrētu grafiku un lēnu 5400 apgr./min. Mans dators var neizskatīties tik skaists, un tas nav tik plāns, bet galu galā tas ir noderīgāks - vai tāpēc mēs vispirms pērkam datoru?<br/><br/>Es nesaprotu, kāpēc Mac pro nevar izmantot Oculus nav tas būvēts renderēšanai video. Es saprotu, ka tas nevarēs darboties iMac s un tādēļ Oculus būtu firmas Pro lietotājiem sakarā ar prasībām un nāk par cenu.<br/><br/>Tagad cilvēki saka, ka jūsu dators dara visu smago celšanas, tad kāpēc ir cena punkts vairāk nekā $800 par kaut ko, kas nav darīt neko?<br/><br/>Es esmu sajūsmā par VR virzienu, bet ne tur, kur tas ir šobrīd.<br/><br/>Jūsu displejs (kurš ir Rifts) nekad neveic nevienu no smagajiem celšanas darbiem. Tas ir $ 800, jo tas, ko displejs dara; 110 ° skata leņķis (joprojām nav cilvēka acs, bet daudz tuvāk nekā citi displeji) ar ļoti zemu latentumu, lai samazinātu vai novērstu kustību slimību 1200x1800 vienā acu displejā HD kvalitātei.<br/><br/>Un jā, Mac ir ļoti plaši izmanto video renderēšanai, bet tas renderēšana nenotiek pie 30 + fps. Video renderēšanas mašīnas stundas var veikt, lai atveidotu vienu kadru un dažreiz gadiem, lai atveidotu visu filmu. Gala produkti jeb iepriekš sagatavotais materiāls ir tas, kas pēc tam kļūst par 30+fps.<br/><br/>Paldies @TheRealFixxer<br/>Daudz par to, ko tu saki, ir jēga, un daži no tiem, par kuriem es nezināju.<br/><br/>Es domāju, ka es neredzu VR kā spēli, bet kā iegremdēšana un Mac redzēšana ir laba 3dcad un kompilējot video, es domāju, ka viņi varētu labi apkopot ainu. Es pat esmu redzējis, ka 3d rada filmu. Izveidot 3D pasauli un ievietot kameras apgabalos, lai noskaidrotu, kā izskatīsies aina<br/><br/>Bet es piekrītu, ka Mac vairāk izmanto CPU ciklus, pat izmantojot tur GPU, lai palīdzētu. Ar to, ka ir citi virzieni, kurus varētu ņemt to. Tāpat kā ārējās zibens spēriena videokartes.<br/><br/>Mans liels grip ir fakts, Octulas tiek uzskatīta par patēriņa produktu. Ja prasības ir tik augstas, tad tas ir vairāk pro produkts, un ir reklāmas, kā to. Es saprotu, ka tehnoloģija ir, bet nejūtu, ka tā ir patēriņa prece.<br/><br/>Jā, jums ir taisnība. Apple ir arī problēmas ar programmatūru. Lielākā daļa neizmanto "metāla" ābolu programmēšanas valodu, kas paātrina spēļu apstrādi, jo tas ir Apple vienīgais risinājums, kurā daudzi izmanto spēļu dzinējus, kas darbojas Microsoft Direct X vai atvērtā koda Opengl, ko lielākā daļa spēļu izmanto Linux un oSX. Opengl ir aptuveni 20% lēnāks un dažkārt daudz vairāk, salīdzinot ar tiešo x, lai top no līnijas spēļu karti, kas darbojas oSX darbojas tik ātri, ir vidēja līmeņa spēļu karte logos. Tik lielas problēmas nemaz nerunājot par lielāko Mac ir iebūvēts kartēm, kas nav uzlabojamība.<br/><br/>Mac Pro ir tik atšķirīgs, ka Apple būtu jādara, jo tas nebūtu vērts karšu pārdevējs to darīt, jo nav peļņa to viņiem ar nelielu iespējamo pircēju tur būtu par to. Apple nepatīk zaudēt naudu, tāpēc es neredzu, ka tas kādreiz notiek. Apple zaudētu naudu, piedāvājot video karšu jauninājumus mac plusi.<br/><br/>Nu viņš ir punkts, lai gan man nav rūp oculus rift, drīzāk gaidīt starVR. Vajadzētu būt iespēja pievienot labāku GPU uz iMac un MacBook Pro. Ir arī skumji, ka nav vairāk nVidia kartes, Man patika CUDA atbalsts tagad man būs jāpērk dators un jāinstalē Linux maniem CUDA projektiem.<br/><br/>Gaming ir augošs tirgus, un tas nebūs ilgi, kamēr pat iPhones ir vairāk GPU veiktspēju nekā Mac. Es piekrītu, ka Apple vajadzētu piedāvāt augstākās klases GPU Mac<br/><br/>Mani ļoti uztrauc augstas veiktspējas diskrētas grafikas trūkums Mac datoros. Pat tāda iMac augšpusē tiek izmantots novecojis mobilais GPU, kuru, protams, nevar uzlabot. Ja es gribu, lai attīstītu programmatūru VR, Apple ir atstājis man nav citas izvēles, kā pirkt vai veidot datoru, lai palaistu to. Kā liels Apple ventilatoru (jā, es atzīstu to) tas padara mani diezgan skumji.<br/><br/>BTW, VR nav daži iet iedoma. Ja esat mēģinājis to jūs zināt, ko es domāju. VR gatavojas mainīt spēļu un satura radīšanu uz visiem laikiem. Mans vienīgais jāuztraucas par VR ir tas, ka ir pārāk labs. Varētu būt miljoniem cilvēku, kas kļūs atkarīgi no dzīves un spēles virtuālajā pasaulē. Paskaties, cik daudz cilvēku kļuva atkarīgi no MMO, kas spēlēja uz plakana ekrāna. Ar VR jūs patiešām jūtaties kā jūs esat spēlē.<br/><br/>Nav noraizējies par kaut ko, es esmu diezgan pārliecināts, ka ābolu būs sava īstenošana Mac un iOS, kad tehnoloģija būs gatava patērētājiem, tieši tagad tas ir vairāk par hardcore lietotājiem. Tāpat kā vienmēr ābolu patīk laiks savu klātbūtni īstajā laikā, ar pareizo produktu. Ticiet ābolu.<br/><br/>Tas ir smieklīgi, ka daudzi cilvēki zina, kurš vr ir labāks, pamatojoties uz os atbalstu. Es domāju, ka jūs, puiši, veicāt smagu testēšanu, un tagad ir puisis lielajā elektroniskajā veikalā, kas vislabāk zina.<br/><br/>HTC teica, ka tas sniegs atbalstu osx, bet tas joprojām ir redzams.<br/><br/>Es saprotu, ka daudzi no jums puiši ir apzīmogoti tur d ** ks. Bet saprotu, ka Apple ir vairāk vērsta uz klēpjdatoriem. Un klēpjdatori nevar būt pildīta ar lielāku jaudu nekā PC, sakarā ar izmēru, siltuma, enerģijas patēriņu utt.<br/><br/>Viņam ir taisnība, kaut arī viņš to ievieto * *** izteiksmē. Es mīlu savu Mac, bet Kungs tam ir nepieciešams palielināt grafiku. Ne, ka tas ir nepieciešams maksāt vairāk, bet es būtu vairāk nekā gatavs maksāt nedaudz papildus par labāku grafikas karti vai vismaz ir iespēja instalēt savu. Tas tiešām ir pārāk slikti šis puisis bija padarīt savu paziņojumu skaņu, piemēram, viņš ir tikai plain neizglītots. |

| What Guys Said 19<br/><br/>No, it is because entertainment producers and product marketers want actors/actresses and models who look like the majority of the audience, so that they are relatable and therefore more effective sales tools. I am sure that Asian women look wonderful to Asian men. To me, as a white man, they have zero appeal.<br/><br/>@cowboy101 I am 100 per cent straight. I do not go outside of my race. When I was a soldier I had the "me love you long time" experience in Asia. That has left me feeling uncomfortable whenever there are Asian females near me. Sometimes I become profoundly uncomfortable, even though the particular individuals have done nothing to merit it. During a visit to Thailand, I found that the only way to prevent myself being propositioned on the street was to take white a female with me as a minder.<br/><br/>Aha the thing is that there isn't many white people (or any at all) in China, but in 'white' places, (or at least Australia) there are quite a lot of Asians around there, which made me think about this question...<br/><br/>Maybe in parts of the country where you stick at (remember, birds of a feather...), just like to republicans it seems that most people are republican etc. While it can only be small minority that you are surrounded by.<br/><br/>And as far as I know, there are a lot of whites in china, mainly by business, etc. But it's simple, most of people there are Asian, so they prefere Asian girls (dogs like dogs , cats like cats, most people prefere their own kind). And there is nothing wrong with that. Same is in white countries.<br/><br/>I think Asians are the most beautful. Unfortunately for me the 2 I got involved with in my life one was using me for my place/internet a long time ago and the recent one was a gold digging stupid bitch. She never graduated college and was 30. I would be extremely happy if I met a smart cute Asian woman near my age that was not a gold digger.<br/><br/>@Prettyapathetic yes because when a man loves deeply he always good with you on bed no matter size of tits or colour of skin and a real man always respect a girl in every relation like mother, sister, wife, girlfriend etc<br/><br/>as a model from childhood I got my start with a company called sugar & spice. I was recruited in Japan while my family was stationed there.<br/><br/>you get a job because they are going for a certain look, who are they targeting, and the area you live in.<br/><br/>I had to leave the industry last year because of health reasons. I worked with with many types of people, korean, Japanese, chinese, polish, german, American, Spanish, arabic. I've worked with children, adults, teenagers all of these ethnicities.<br/><br/>I am half white half Native American (Lakota) so they loved my look from a young age. but there are many beauty standards in the industry and not all of them are as portrayed, some being made to look worse, and some not taken seriously enough...<br/><br/>Nope, it's because the Asian men are jealous and angry and invent thousands of excuses every rare time who have Asian women in the media because they are jealous of Asian women, and Americans want to keep the status of white women, this is why the couples between Asian women and white men are boycotted and all other race with white women are pushed, it's white women wiht white men and white women with other races in American media, since it's opression and offensive for the ego of men of other race the women of own race with white but white women with other race is "anti-racism". You need to understand the American political social engineering all over these years of media, democrats, politics and propaganda.<br/><br/>Anyway, in countries like china, japan, korea they have Asian men and Asian women only and the only exceptions are when they import a white women to make some fantasy scene for them but it's not so much, it's forbiden expose the hatred and jealousy of some Asian men.<br/><br/>The Asian boys will be happy if you say something against other men, but they will be angry if you say that the Asian girl will die for the blond girl date the handsome caucasian/white dude, they will try to force Asian women to make anything against these men to these small vocal group of Asian men feel better in their hatred, excuses, racism and jealousy. This is why Asian women is not showed so much, it's because the Asian men will be angry, it's because the white women can't be replaced, and the American propaganda is around white women with white men, white women with other race, white women against white men for the other race of men, white women in everything.<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>1&#124;0<br/><br/>0&#124;0<br/><br/>Opinion Owner<br/><br/>1mo<br/><br/>All the excuses of media and propaganda and all lies for racism, jealousy and hate aren't used against white women by the same men who invent the excuses, white women all the time in the media, understand, the American social engineering is made by democrats, democrats hate white men, and the most popular couples would be white men and Asian women but it's horrible for a few group of white racists who are racists even against Asians, is bad for the angry Asian men and their excuses, is bad for the white women, the democrats really don't like white men and work hard to try to make the couple and anything wiht white men and non-white women be related to bad things while pushing white women and non-white men. It's a American political problem.<br/><br/>I think it's a opression against the ego of the men of other race, so the white guys need to look bad, be some sort of jokes, be soft, while the scenes with white women and other race is the opposite of the scenes of white men and non-white women | Ko puiši teica 19<br/><br/>Nē, tas ir tāpēc, ka izklaides producenti un produktu tirgotāji vēlas dalībniekus / aktierus un modeļus, kas izskatās kā lielākā daļa auditorijas, lai tie būtu savstarpēji saistīti un tādējādi efektīvāki pārdošanas rīki. Es esmu pārliecināts, ka Āzijas vīriešiem Āzijas sievietes izskatās brīnišķīgi. Man kā baltam cilvēkam viņiem nav nekādas pievilcības.<br/><br/>@cowboy101 Es esmu 100 procenti taisni. Es neiešu ārpus savas rases. Kad es biju karavīrs, man bija "es tevi mīlu ilgu laiku" pieredze Āzijā. Tas ir atstājis mani neērti, kad vien man tuvumā ir Āzijas sievietes. Dažreiz es jūtos ārkārtīgi neērti, kaut arī šie cilvēki nav darījuši neko, lai to nopelnītu. Apmeklējot Taizemi, es atklāju, ka vienīgais veids, kā nepieļaut, ka mani uz ielas apvaino, ir ņemt balto sievieti sev līdzi par apsēstu.<br/><br/>Aha lieta ir tāda, ka Ķīnā nav daudz balto cilvēku (vai vispār nav), bet "baltajās" vietās (vai vismaz Austrālijā) apkārt ir diezgan daudz aziāti, kas lika man domāt par šo jautājumu...<br/><br/>Varbūt tajās valsts daļās, kur jūs pieķeraties (atcerieties, spalvas putni...), tāpat kā republikāņiem, šķiet, ka lielākā daļa cilvēku ir republikāņi utt. Lai gan tas var būt tikai neliela minoritāte, ka jūs ieskauj.<br/><br/>Un, cik es zinu, Ķīnā ir daudz baltumu, galvenokārt pēc uzņēmējdarbības utt. Bet tas ir vienkārši, lielākā daļa cilvēku ir Āzijas, tāpēc viņi dod priekšroku Āzijas meitenēm (suņiem, piemēram, suņiem , kaķiem, lielākā daļa cilvēku dod priekšroku savam veidam). Un tas nav nekas slikts. Tas pats ir baltās valstīs.<br/><br/>Es domāju, ka aziātiem ir visvairāk beautful. Diemžēl man 2 es got iesaistīti ar manā dzīvē viens bija, izmantojot mani par manu vietu / interneta sen un nesen viens bija zelta rakšana stulba kuce. Viņa nekad nav beigusi koledžu un bija 30. Es būtu ļoti laimīgs, ja es satiku gudru gudrs Āzijas sievieti netālu no mana vecuma, kas nebija zelta racējs.<br/><br/>@Prettyapathetic jā, jo, kad cilvēks mīl dziļi viņš vienmēr ir labs ar jums uz gultas neatkarīgi no izmēra tits vai ādas krāsas un īsts vīrietis vienmēr ciena meiteni visās attiecībās, piemēram, māte, māsa, sieva, draudzene utt<br/><br/>kā modeli no bērnības es saņēmu savu sākumu ar uzņēmumu, ko sauc par cukuru un garšvielām. Es tiku pieņemts darbā Japānā, kamēr mana ģimene bija izvietota tur.<br/><br/>jūs saņemat darbu, jo viņi dodas uz noteiktu izskatu, kas viņi mērķē, un apgabalu, kurā jūs dzīvojat.<br/><br/>Man pagājušajā gadā nācās pamest nozari veselības apsvērumu dēļ. Es strādāju ar daudziem cilvēku veidiem, korejiešu, japāņu, ķīniešu, poļu, vācu, amerikāņu, spāņu, arābu. Esmu strādājis ar bērniem, pieaugušajiem, pusaudžiem visas šīs etniskās piederības.<br/><br/>Es esmu puse baltā puse Native American (Lakota), tāpēc viņi mīlēja manu izskatu no agra vecuma. bet ir daudz skaistuma standartus nozarē, un ne visi no tiem ir kā attēlots, daži tiek veikti, lai izskatās sliktāk, un daži nav veikti pietiekami nopietni...<br/><br/>Nē, tas ir tāpēc, ka Āzijas vīrieši ir greizsirdīgs un dusmīgs, un izgudrot tūkstošiem attaisnojumu katru retu reizi, kad ir Āzijas sievietes plašsaziņas līdzekļos, jo tie ir greizsirdīgs uz Āzijas sievietēm, un amerikāņi vēlas saglabāt statusu baltajām sievietēm, tas ir iemesls, kāpēc pāri starp Āzijas sievietēm un baltajiem vīriešiem tiek boikotēti un visas pārējās sacensības ar baltām sievietēm tiek stumtas, tas ir balts sievietēm wiht baltās rases un baltām sievietēm ar citām rasēm Amerikas plašsaziņas līdzekļos, jo tas ir Jums ir jāsaprot amerikāņu politiskā sociālā inženierija visā šajos plašsaziņas līdzekļu, demokrātu, politikas un propagandas gados.<br/><br/>Jebkurā gadījumā, tādās valstīs kā Ķīna, Japāna, Koreja viņiem ir tikai Āzijas vīrieši un Āzijas sievietes, un vienīgie izņēmumi ir tad, kad viņi importē baltas sievietes, lai radītu viņiem kādu fantāzijas ainu, bet tas nav tik daudz, tas ir forbiden atklāt naidu un greizsirdību dažu Āzijas vīriešu.<br/><br/>Āzijas zēni būs laimīgi, ja jūs kaut ko sakāt pret citiem vīriešiem, bet viņi būs dusmīgi, ja jūs sakāt, ka Āzijas meitene mirs par blondu meiteni datumu skaists kaukāzietis / balts frants, viņi centīsies piespiest Āzijas sievietes kaut ko pret šiem mazajiem vokāls grupa Āzijas vīriešiem justies labāk savā naidu, attaisnojumi, rasismu un greizsirdība. Tāpēc Āzijas sievietes netiek tik daudz parādītas, tas ir tāpēc, ka Āzijas vīrieši būs dusmīgi, tas ir tāpēc, ka baltās sievietes nevar aizstāt, un amerikāņu propaganda ir ap baltām sievietēm ar baltiem vīriešiem, baltām sievietēm ar citām rasēm, baltām sievietēm pret baltiem vīriešiem par citu rasi vīriešiem, baltām sievietēm viss.<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>1 līdz 0<br/><br/>0 līdz 0<br/><br/>Viedoklis Īpašnieks<br/><br/>1 mēn.<br/><br/>Visi plašsaziņas līdzekļu un propagandas attaisnojumi un visi meli par rasismu, greizsirdību un naidu netiek izmantoti pret baltajām sievietēm vieni un tie paši vīrieši, kas izgudro attaisnojumus, baltās sievietes visu laiku plašsaziņas līdzekļos, saprot, amerikāņu sociālo inženieriju veido demokrāti, demokrāti ienīst baltos vīriešus, un populārākie pāri būtu baltie vīrieši un Āzijas sievietes, bet tas ir briesmīgi dažām balto rasistu grupām, kas ir rasisti pat pret aziātiem, ir slikti Tā ir amerikāņu politiskā problēma.<br/><br/>Es domāju, ka tas ir apspiešana pret citu rasu vīriešu ego, tāpēc baltajiem ir jāizskatās slikti, jābūt kaut kādiem jokiem, jābūt mīkstiem, bet ainas ar baltām sievietēm un citām rasēm ir pretējas baltu vīriešu un nebaltu sieviešu ainām. |
