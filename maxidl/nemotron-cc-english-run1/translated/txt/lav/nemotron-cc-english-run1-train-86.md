| Leclaire<br/><br/>The historic Leclaire neighborhood, once referred to as Edwardsville's "suburb to the south," was founded as a cooperative community in 1890 and remained a separate village until annexed to the city of Edwardsville in 1934. Newspapers and magazines throughout the United States and Europe reported on the Leclaire experiment, particularly during the first 20 years of its existence. In 1979, due to its unique history, the former village was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.<br/><br/>Leclaire was founded by Nelson Oliver Nelson, a St. Louis plumbing manufacturer who, for many years, sought to advance the plight of the working class. Nelson wanted to improve working conditions for his employees and provide housing near the factories so workers and their families could easily participate in recreational and educational programs offered free of charge by the company. Prior to 1890, while still in St. Louis, the N. O. Nelson Company's manufacturing and distribution businesses began providing profit sharing along with educational and recreational opportunities. The Leclaire cooperative experiment would bring additional benefits.<br/><br/>When Nelson employees indicated they wanted to relocate to a rural location, company representatives approached leaders of small towns in several Missouri and Illinois communities near their St. Louis headquarters. They were looking for a suitable property to build new factories and a model village. South of Edwardsville they found a 125-acre tract of land with access to water, coal, and transportation. Local businessmen acted quickly to offer a financial incentive. In less than three weeks, the community raised a fund of $20,000 from individual contributions of between $1 and $1,000 to entice Nelson to choose Edwardsville for his enterprise.<br/><br/>City leaders had hoped to locate property inside the city limits of Edwardsville, but when no suitable site could be found, they were confident that the Nelson investment south of town would soon become a part of Edwardsville. Although Nelson fulfilled all the contingencies for construction and job creation in his contract, it would be 44 years before annexation to Edwardsville. Leclaire, bounded by Madison/Brown Avenues to the east, the railroad tracks to the west, Hadley/McKinley Avenues on the south and Wolf Street to the north, remained an independent village from 1890 to 1934. During that time it earned a reputation for innovations in business, education and residential planning.<br/><br/>The village of Leclaire on a 1931 map of Edwardsville<br/>Courtesy of Paul Jenkins<br/><br/>Nelson's decision to build a village was not made on a whim. By the late 1880s he was an international leader in the fields of cooperation and profit-sharing, exchanging social theories with others around the world while expanding his St. Louis business. He named his experimental village after the Parisian profit-sharer, Edme Jean Leclaire, but he visited many other social visionaries who provided information and inspiration. Compiling the best ideas from these examples, Nelson founded Leclaire to, in his words, "give work, promote intelligence, provide recreation, foster beauty, and make homes." These were all factors he determined necessary for men to lead fulfilling lives. Later writers used these words to formulate Leclaire's founding principles: Work, Homes, Education, Recreation, and Beauty, but with the additional important principle of Freedom.<br/><br/>Work<br/><br/>Work could be considered the most important of these factors since without the factory jobs in Leclaire, there would be no village. The brick factory buildings were designed by architect E. A. Cameron to provide natural light, ventilation in the summer, and heated floors in the winter. There was a fire suppression system and, although industrial accidents were not eliminated, every effort was made to guarantee the safety of the workers. The ivy-covered brick buildings were surrounded by well-manicured lawns and flower gardens giving the complex a campus-like appearance. In 1894, New York World reporter Nellie Bly called the buildings "the ideal perfection of buildings for man to labor in".<br/><br/>The manufacturing complex of the N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company in Leclaire<br/>From Friends of Leclaire<br/><br/>Nelson company policies were designed to protect the financial stability of employees. Workers could earn a share of the profits and have a voice in the company if they chose that option. The profit-sharing plan gave Nelson employees a pride of ownership that resulted in a supportive workforce. There were a few short-lived labor strikes over the years, but for the most part, labor problems were rare. Workers also had reasonable hours and competitive wages. There was a provident fund that provided for pensions and sick leave, as well as widow pensions if a worker died, whether or not the death was related to his employment.<br/><br/>Company headquarters for the N. O. Nelson Company (NONCO) remained in St. Louis, but all of the N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company was moved to Leclaire. The manufacturing company was divided into shops that made a variety of products. In 1900, the shops became independent companies for tax purposes, but all were still owned by the N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company. The shops included the Cabinet Mill where wood products from cabinetry to millwork were produced. The skilled craftsmen that worked here also fulfilled special contracts, including teller cages for a local bank and an altar still in use at St. Andrew's Episcopal Church in Edwardsville. The Marble Shop specialized in architectural marble that was cut and installed by Nelson crews in homes, businesses, and even state capitols throughout the Midwest. The Machine Shop, which became Bignall and Keeler, made pipe fitting machines, pumps, gauges, and various mechanical tools expected in the plumbing trade. They also branched out to manufacture specialty items like the Leclaire Bicycle in the mid-1890s. The Brass Shop included a foundry where various plumbing pipes and tools were manufactured. These examples represent just some of the work done in the Leclaire factories. The company's logo was a stylized "NONCO" that can still be seen on plumbing fixtures and some fire hydrants in Edwardsville today.<br/><br/>Homes<br/><br/>Before homes could be built, housing was needed for workers who were completing the factory buildings as well as building homes. To meet those needs, the company built the "Club House," a large building that served many purposes. In addition to lodging, it was the community's first educational building, and it contained a well-stocked library.<br/><br/>Construction of the residential portion of Leclaire began immediately after the village was founded in June of 1890. Julius Pitzman, the innovative landscape architect who laid out the first lots in Leclaire, set them up with a number of protective covenants. The covenants provided for wide, curvilinear streets, large lots, and a deed restriction that limited the properties to residential or educational purposes only. The company paved the streets, provided electric street lights, installed sidewalks, and planted hundreds of trees along the streets of Leclaire. Later sections of Leclaire were laid out with a conventional grid design and smaller lots, but still included the deed restrictions.<br/><br/>A Leclaire Victorian cottage in 1907<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Initially the homes were built by the company and then sold at near cost to Nelson employees to encourage home ownership. If a worker became ill and could not make his mortgage, payments were suspended until after he returned to work. The homes were offered in a variety of house designs and the company advertised that no two dwellings were alike. The earliest homes were primarily Victorian cottages that came with electricity and running water. These were followed by bungalows, foursquares, and even some kit homes. Residents could purchase a company-built home or buy an empty lot and build a house themselves, provided the architectural design met company standards.<br/><br/>In later years, lots were sold to investors, usually Edwardsville residents, and many homes in the 1920s were built by local contractors who then sold them to area residents.<br/><br/>Education<br/><br/>Nelson believed in education for everyone, including the working class. Educational programming began with a kindergarten at the Club House in 1892 and continued in the new educational building at 722 Holyoake Road. Commonly called the "School House," this building provided a large hall for meetings and programs, but had moveable partitions to divide it into classroom space during the day. In the evenings, there were dances, meetings, or programs of the Leclaire Self-Culture Club which featured weekly lectures by Washington University professors or nationally known speakers who, like N. O. Nelson, were part of the social betterment movement at the turn of the century. These included Jane Addams, Edward Everett Hale, Samuel "Golden Rule" Jones, and author Charlotte Perkins Gilman, among others.<br/><br/>Children enrolled in the Leclaire kindergarten in 1913<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>In the ten years following the 1895 construction of the education building, there were a series of educational experiments including an industrial school, college, night school, and an academy. The earliest and longest-lived endeavor was the morning kindergarten, founded in 1892, that used the Fröbel Model. This two-year program was free to everyone, including Edwardsville children, until 1931 when for financial reasons the company began charging tuition to students who were not the children of employees. Nelson Manufacturing operated a kindergarten until 1934 when the building was turned over to the Edwardsville School District for a nominal fee.<br/><br/>Recreation<br/><br/>Boaters on Leclaire Lake in 1915<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Recreation was an important feature of Leclaire. The company provided sports facilities for baseball, tennis, and later, football. A bowling and billiard hall was constructed and there was a lake for boating, swimming, fishing, or ice skating in winter. Leclaire Park was furnished with boathouses, male & female bath houses, and a large pavilion. Residents organized dances, hayrides, spelling bees, and other activities, and the company sponsored a band that played regularly at entertainments in the village or in Edwardsville. Like the educational functions at the Club House and School House, the recreational facilities at Leclaire were open to all and were often a destination for Edwardsville and even St. Louis visitors.<br/><br/>Beauty<br/><br/>Early photograph of Leclaire Lake<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>The last of the factors Nelson deemed important for a satisfying life concerned the environment. Nelson knew about the importance of healthy living. He valued the beauty and cleanliness that could be found in the country, and encouraged all in Leclaire to beautify their property by planting gardens and orchards. Nelson himself led by example, so a company greenhouse provided free flowers and competitions were held for the most beautiful yards. Leclaire was laid out so that the entire village had a park-like setting still evident today.<br/><br/>Freedom<br/><br/>The Leclaire Cooperative store<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Nelson listed five founding principles for Leclaire, but modern writers add a sixth: Freedom. All of the programs offered by the company were available to employees as well as local residents, but none were mandatory. The freedom to choose whether or not to participate in company programs was entirely up to the individual. Residents of Leclaire could work for Nelson Manufacturing or elsewhere, and workers were under no obligation to live in Leclaire. Participation in recreational and educational programs was also optional. There was also a company store where employees could shop, but unlike other company towns, no one was in debt to the company store. The Leclaire Store was a cooperative where members were charged fair market prices, but were then paid quarterly dividends.<br/><br/>A Different Company Town<br/><br/>All of these benefits made Leclaire unique from other company towns. But there were also individual instances where the company showed compassion and care for the employees. The company closed the factories and hired excursion trains to take workers and their families to St. Louis for a day at the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair. When money was tight, Nelson would occasionally place extra cash in each pay envelope to make life easier for workers, and if he instituted a program the men did not agree with, they talked it out and, as often as not, Nelson would reverse himself.<br/><br/>Born in Lillesand, Norway, in 1841, N. O. Nelson was a complicated man. He was a capitalist who believed in free enterprise, but also a socialist, a follower of the "Golden Rule", and a patriot who served for the Union in the Civil War. By 1900, he was a multimillionaire, but by the time of his death in 1922, he had given it all away for the betterment of the working class.<br/><br/>Although Leclaire was not Nelson's only social experiment, it is considered his most successful endeavor. Other major efforts for social betterment included a chain of co-operative grocery stores in New Orleans, a kindergarten for the children of black employees in his Bessemer, Alabama, factories, and a home for consumptives in Indio, California.<br/><br/>Nelson's Village of Leclaire was renowned internationally as a noteworthy and successful experiment. It was described in the New York World on numerous occasions but in particular by reporter Nellie Bly in 1894 who wrote at length about the model town where "The labor question is solved and everybody happy in a little village near St. Louis." The Los Angeles Times also regularly reported on N. O. Nelson, as did the Chicago Daily Tribune and numerous other publications.<br/><br/>In a speech at Leclaire's 15th anniversary celebration in 1915, Nelson said, "Leclaire extends to you a wide open hospitality, and bids you enjoy today the ease and comfort and beauty and inspiration which we enjoy every day." More than a century has passed since that day, but the invitation still stands. Residents and researchers are invited to learn about Leclaire's history and consider the lessons that might be learned for the betterment of future generations.<br/><br/>One of the former buildings of the manufacturing complex in 2019, which now serves as the N. O. Nelson Campus of Lewis and Clark Community College<br/>Photo by Ben Ostermeier<br/><br/>Friends of Leclaire, organized in 1990 following Leclaire's Centennial celebration, promotes the history of Leclaire through a website (historic-leclaire.org), publications, and a festival, Leclaire Parkfest, held annually on the third Sunday in October | Leclaire<br/><br/>Vēsturiskā Leclaire apkaime, kādreiz saukta par Edwardsville "suburb uz dienvidiem," tika dibināta kā kooperatīvā kopiena 1890 un palika atsevišķs ciems līdz pievienots pilsētas Edwardsville 1934. Laikraksti un žurnāli visā Amerikas Savienotajās Valstīs un Eiropā ziņoja par Leclaire eksperimentu, jo īpaši tā pirmajos 20 pastāvēšanas gados. 1979. gadā, pateicoties savai unikālajai vēsturei, bijušais ciemats tika iekļauts Valsts vēsturisko vietu reģistrā.<br/><br/>Leclaire dibināja Nelsons Olivers Nelsons, Sentluisas santehnikas ražotājs, kurš daudzus gadus centās uzlabot darba klases stāvokli. Nelsons vēlējās uzlabot savus darbiniekus un nodrošināt mājokļus rūpnīcu tuvumā, lai darbinieki un viņu ģimenes varētu viegli piedalīties atpūtas un izglītības programmās, ko uzņēmums piedāvā bez maksas. Līdz 1890. gadam, vēl atrodoties Sentluisā, N. O. Nelsona kompānijas ražošanas un izplatīšanas uzņēmumi sāka nodrošināt peļņas dalīšanu kopā ar izglītības un atpūtas iespējām. Eksperiments ar Leclaire kooperatīvu dotu papildu labumu.<br/><br/>Kad Nelsona darbinieki norādīja, ka viņi vēlas pārcelties uz lauku atrašanās vietu, uzņēmumu pārstāvji vērsās pie vairāku Misūri un Ilinoisas kopienu vadītājiem netālu no Sentluisas galvenās mītnes. Viņi meklēja piemērotu īpašumu, lai uzbūvētu jaunas fabrikas un paraugciematu, un uz dienvidiem no Edvardsvilas viņi atrada 125 akru zemes gabalu ar piekļuvi ūdenim, oglēm un transportam. Vietējie uzņēmēji ātri rīkojās, lai piedāvātu finansiālu stimulu. Mazāk nekā trīs nedēļu laikā kopiena piesaistīja $ 20,000 fondu no individuālām iemaksām no $ 1 līdz $ 1000, lai vilinātu Nelsonu izvēlēties Edwardsville par savu uzņēmumu.<br/><br/>Pilsētas vadītāji bija cerējuši atrast īpašumus Edwardsville pilsētas robežās, bet, kad nevarēja atrast piemērotu vietu, viņi bija pārliecināti, ka Nelsona investīcijas uz dienvidiem no pilsētas drīz kļūs par daļu no Edwardsville. Lai gan Nelsons savā līgumā izpildīja visus celtniecības un darba vietu radīšanas gadījumus, pagāja 44 gadi pirms Edwardsville aneksijas. Leclaire, ko ierobežo Madison / Brown Avenues uz austrumiem, dzelzceļa sliedēm uz rietumiem, Hadley / McKinley Avenues uz dienvidiem un Wolf Street uz ziemeļiem, palika neatkarīgs ciems no 1890 līdz 1934. Šajā laikā tā izpelnījās atzinību par inovācijām uzņēmējdarbībā, izglītībā un mājokļu plānošanā.<br/><br/>Leclaire ciems 1931. gada kartē Edwardsville<br/>Ar Pola Dženkinsa laipnu atļauju<br/><br/>Nelsona lēmums būvēt ciematu netika pieņemts pēc kaprīzēm. 1880. gadu beigās viņš bija starptautisks līderis sadarbības un peļņas sadales jomās, apmainoties ar sociālajām teorijām ar citiem visā pasaulē, vienlaikus paplašinot savu Sentluisas biznesu. Savu eksperimentālo ciematu viņš nosauca Parīzes peļņas akcijas vadītāja Edmes Žana Leklēra (Edme Jean Leclaire) vārdā, taču viņš apmeklēja daudzus citus sociālos vizionārus, kas sniedza informāciju un iedvesmu. Apkopojot labākās idejas no šiem piemēriem, Nelsons nodibināja Leclaire, lai, viņa vārdiem sakot, "dotu darbu, veicinātu inteliģenci, nodrošinātu atpūtu, veicinātu skaistumu un padarītu mājas." Tie visi bija faktori, kurus viņš noteica, kas vajadzīgi, lai vīrieši vadītu piepildītas dzīves. Vēlāk rakstnieki izmantoja šos vārdus, lai formulētu Leclaire pamatprincipus: Darbs, Mājas, Izglītība, Atpūta, un Skaistums, bet ar papildu svarīgu brīvības principu.<br/><br/>Darbs<br/><br/>Darbu varētu uzskatīt par vissvarīgāko no šiem faktoriem, jo bez rūpnīcas darbavietām Leclaire nebūtu ciemata. Ķieģeļu rūpnīcas ēkas projektēja arhitekts E. A. Kamerons, lai nodrošinātu dabisko gaismu, ventilāciju vasarā un apsildāmās grīdas ziemā. Tika ierīkota ugunsdrošības sistēma un, lai gan rūpnieciskās avārijas netika likvidētas, tika pieliktas visas pūles, lai garantētu strādnieku drošību. Efeju klātās ķieģeļu ēkas tika ieskautas ar labi koptiem zālājiem un puķu dārziem, piešķirot kompleksam Campus līdzīgu izskatu. 1894. gadā New York World reportieris Nellie Bly sauca ēkas par "ideālu ēku pilnību, lai cilvēks varētu strādāt".<br/><br/>N. O. Nelson ražošanas uzņēmuma ražošanas komplekss Leclaire<br/>No Leclaire draugiem<br/><br/>Nelson uzņēmuma politika tika izstrādāta, lai aizsargātu finanšu stabilitāti darbiniekiem. Darbinieki varētu nopelnīt daļu no peļņas un ir balss uzņēmumā, ja viņi izvēlējās šo iespēju. Peļņas sadales plāns Nelsona darbiniekiem deva lepnumu par īpašumtiesībām, kas radīja atbalstošu darbaspēku. Gadu gaitā bija daži īslaicīgi darba streiki, bet lielākoties darba problēmas bija retas. Strādniekiem bija arī saprātīgas stundas un konkurētspējīgas algas, tur bija uzkrājumu fonds, kas paredzēja pensijas un slimības atvaļinājumu, kā arī atraitņu pensijas, ja darba ņēmējs nomira, neatkarīgi no tā, vai nāve bija saistīta ar viņa darbu.<br/><br/>Kompānijas N.O. Nelson Company (NONCO) galvenā mītne palika Sentluisā, bet visa N.O. Nelson Manufacturing Company tika pārvietota uz Leclaire. Ražošanas uzņēmums tika sadalīts veikalos, kas izgatavoja dažādus produktus. 1900. gadā veikali kļuva par neatkarīgiem uzņēmumiem nodokļu vajadzībām, bet visi joprojām piederēja N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company. Veikalos ietilpa kabineta dzirnavas, kur tika ražoti koka izstrādājumi no skapja līdz dzirnavām. Kvalificēti amatnieki, kas šeit strādāja, arī izpildīja īpašus līgumus, tostarp par vietējo banku un altāri, kas joprojām tiek izmantots Sv. Andreja episkopālajā baznīcā Edwardsville. Marble Shop specializējās arhitektūras marmora, kas tika sagriezti un uzstādītas Nelson apkalpēm mājās, uzņēmumiem, un pat valsts capitols visā Midwest. Mašīnu veikals, kas kļuva par Bignall un Keeler, izgatavoja cauruļu montāžas mašīnas, sūkņus, mērinstrumentus un dažādus mehāniskos instrumentus, kas paredzēti santehnikas tirdzniecībā. Viņi arī sazaroja, lai 1890. gadu vidū ražotu īpašus priekšmetus, piemēram, Leclaire velosipēdu. Brass veikals ietvēra lietuvi, kur tika ražotas dažādas santehnikas caurules un instrumenti. Šie piemēri ir tikai daži no darbiem, kas veikti Leclaire rūpnīcās. Uzņēmuma logotips bija stilizēts "NONCO", ko šodien joprojām var redzēt uz santehnikas iekārtām un dažiem ugunsdzēsības hidrantiem Edwardsville.<br/><br/>Mājas<br/><br/>Pirms māju būvniecības bija nepieciešams mājoklis strādniekiem, kas pabeidza rūpnīcas ēkas, kā arī būvēja mājas. Lai apmierinātu šīs vajadzības, uzņēmums uzbūvēja "Kluba māju", lielu ēku, kas kalpoja daudziem mērķiem. Papildus izmitināšanai, tā bija kopienas pirmā izglītības ēka, un tajā bija labi aprīkota bibliotēka.<br/><br/>Leclaire dzīvojamās daļas celtniecība sākās uzreiz pēc ciemata dibināšanas 1890. gada jūnijā. Jūliuss Pitzmans, inovatīvais ainavu arhitekts, kurš Leklērā izstādīja pirmās lotes, izveidoja tās ar vairākām aizsargājošām derībām. Derībās bija paredzētas platas, līkumainas ielas, lielas lotes un noteikts ierobežojums, kas ierobežoja īpašumus tikai dzīvojamos vai izglītības nolūkos. Uzņēmums bruģēja ielas, nodrošināja elektriskos ielu apgaismojumus, ierīkoja ietves un iestādīja simtiem koku pa Leclaire ielām. Vēlākie Leclaire posmi tika izklāti ar parasto režģa dizainu un mazākām partijām, bet joprojām ietvēra akta ierobežojumus.<br/><br/>Leclaire Viktorijas māja 1907. gadā<br/>Sindija Reinharta<br/><br/>Sākotnēji māju būvēja uzņēmums, un pēc tam to gandrīz par velti pārdeva Nelsona darbiniekiem, lai tie varētu kļūt par mājkalpotājiem, bet, ja kāds strādnieks saslima un nevarēja veikt hipotekāro kredītu, maksājumi tika apturēti līdz brīdim, kad viņš atgriezās darbā. Mājas tika piedāvātas dažādos māju projektos, un uzņēmums reklamēja, ka nav divu vienādu mājokļu. Agrākās mājas galvenokārt bija Viktorijas mājiņas, kas nāca ar elektrību un tekošu ūdeni. Tie sekoja bungalo, foursquares, un pat daži kit mājās. Iedzīvotāji varētu iegādāties uzņēmuma būvēts mājas vai nopirkt tukšu daudz un būvēt māju paši, ja arhitektūras dizains atbilst uzņēmuma standartiem.<br/><br/>Vēlākos gados partijas tika pārdotas investoriem, parasti Edwardsville iedzīvotājiem, un daudzas mājas 1920. gados uzcēla vietējie darbuzņēmēji, kuri pēc tam tos pārdeva apgabala iedzīvotājiem.<br/><br/>Izglītība<br/><br/>Nelsons ticēja izglītībai ikvienam, ieskaitot darba klasi. Izglītības programma sākās ar bērnudārzu kluba mājā 1892. gadā un turpinājās jaunajā izglītības ēkā 722 Holyoake Road. Parasti sauc par "skolas māju", šī ēka nodrošināja lielu zāli sanāksmēm un programmām, bet bija pārvietojamas starpsienas, lai to dienas laikā sadalītu klasē. Vakaros notika dejas, tikšanās vai Leclaire Pašapkalpošanās kluba programmas, kurās bija iknedēļas lekcijas no Vašingtonas universitātes profesoriem vai nacionāli zināmiem runātājiem, kuri, tāpat kā N. O. Nelsons, gadsimta mijā bija daļa no sociālās uzlabošanas kustības. To vidū bija Džeina Addamsa, Edvards Everets Heils, Semjuels "Zelta likums" Džonss un autore Šarlote Pērkinsa Gilmena, cita starpā.<br/><br/>Bērni, kas uzņemti Leclaire bērnudārzā 1913. gadā<br/>Sindija Reinharta<br/><br/>Desmit gadus pēc 1895. gada izglītības ēkas celtniecības notika virkne izglītības eksperimentu, tostarp rūpniecības skola, koledža, nakts skola un akadēmija. Agrākais un visilgāk dzīvojušais pasākums bija 1892. gadā dibinātais rīta bērnudārzs, kurā izmantoja Frēbela modeli. Šī divu gadu programma bija brīva visiem, ieskaitot Edwardsville bērnus, līdz 1931. gadam, kad finansiālu iemeslu dēļ uzņēmums sāka iekasēt mācību maksu studentiem, kuri nebija darbinieku bērni. Nelson Manufacturing darbojās bērnudārzs līdz 1934, kad ēka tika nodota Edwardsville School District par nominālo maksu.<br/><br/>Atpūta<br/><br/>1915. gadā uz Leclaire ezera<br/>Sindija Reinharta<br/><br/>Atpūta bija svarīga Leclaire iezīme. Uzņēmums nodrošināja sporta iespējas beisbolam, tenisam un vēlāk arī futbolam. Tika uzbūvēta boulinga un biljarda zāle, un ziemā bija ezers laivošanai, peldēšanai, makšķerēšanai vai slidošanai. Leclaire Park tika iekārtots ar laivu mājām, vīriešu un sieviešu pirtīm un lielu paviljonu. Iedzīvotāji organizēja dejas, hairīdus, pareizrakstību bites un citas aktivitātes, un uzņēmums sponsorēja grupu, kas regulāri spēlēja izklaidēs ciematā vai Edwardsville. Tāpat kā izglītības funkcijas kluba mājā un skolas mājā, Leclaire atpūtas iespējas bija atvērtas visiem un bieži vien bija galamērķis Edwardsville un pat Sentluisas apmeklētājiem.<br/><br/>Skaistums<br/><br/>Leclaire ezera agrīnā fotogrāfija<br/>Sindija Reinharta<br/><br/>Pēdējais no faktoriem, ko Nelsons uzskatīja par svarīgu, lai dzīve būtu patīkama, attiecās uz vidi. Viņš novērtēja skaistumu un tīrību, ko varēja atrast valstī, un mudināja visus Leclaire izdaiļot savu īpašumu, stādot dārzus un augļu dārzus. Nelsons pats vadīja piemēru, tāpēc uzņēmums siltumnīcas sniedza bezmaksas ziedus un sacensības notika skaistākajām pagalmiem. Leclaire tika izklāstīts tā, ka viss ciems bija parku līdzīgu iestatījumu vēl šodien acīmredzama.<br/><br/>Brīvība<br/><br/>Veikalā Leclaire Cooperative<br/>Sindija Reinharta<br/><br/>Nelsons uzskaitīja piecus Leclaire pamatprincipus, bet mūsdienu rakstnieki pievieno sesto: Brīvība. Visas uzņēmuma piedāvātās programmas bija pieejamas darbiniekiem, kā arī vietējiem iedzīvotājiem, bet neviena no tām nebija obligāta. Brīvība izvēlēties, vai piedalīties uzņēmuma programmās, bija pilnībā atkarīga no indivīda. Leclaire iedzīvotāji varētu strādāt Nelson Manufacturing vai citur, un darbiniekiem nebija pienākuma dzīvot Leclaire. Līdzdalība atpūtas un izglītības programmās arī nebija obligāta. Bija arī uzņēmuma veikals, kurā darbinieki varēja iepirkties, bet atšķirībā no citām uzņēmuma pilsētām neviens nebija parādā uzņēmuma veikalam. Leclaire Store bija kooperatīvs, kurā dalībniekiem tika prasītas taisnīgas tirgus cenas, bet pēc tam izmaksātas ceturkšņa dividendes.<br/><br/>Atšķirīga uzņēmuma pilsēta<br/><br/>Visi šie ieguvumi padarīja Leclaire unikālu no citām uzņēmuma pilsētām, bet bija arī atsevišķi gadījumi, kad uzņēmums izrādīja līdzjūtību un rūpējās par darbiniekiem. Uzņēmums slēdza rūpnīcas un nolīga ekskursiju vilcienus, lai nogādātu darbiniekus un viņu ģimenes uz Sentluisu uz vienu dienu 1904. gada Sentluisas pasaules izstādē. Kad nauda bija saspringta, Nelsons ik pa laikam ielika papildu naudu katrā algas aploksnē, lai atvieglotu strādnieku dzīvi, un, ja viņš iedibināja programmu, kurai vīrieši nepiekrita, viņi par to runāja un, lai cik bieži tas arī nebūtu, Nelsons mainīja savu nostāju.<br/><br/>Dzimis Lillesandā, Norvēģijā, 1841. gadā, N. O. Nelsons bija sarežģīts cilvēks. Viņš bija kapitālists, kurš ticēja brīvai uzņēmējdarbībai, bet arī sociālists, "zelta likuma" sekotājs un patriots, kurš kalpoja Savienībai pilsoņu karā. Līdz 1900, viņš bija multimiljonārs, bet līdz savai nāvei 1922, viņš bija devis to visu prom uzlabošanai darba klasē.<br/><br/>Lai gan Leklērs nebija vienīgais Nelsona sociālais eksperiments, tas tiek uzskatīts par viņa veiksmīgākajiem centieniem. Citi nozīmīgi sociālās uzlabošanas centieni ietvēra kooperatīvu pārtikas veikalu ķēdi Ņūorleānā, bērnudārzu melnādaino darbinieku bērniem viņa Besemer, Alabama, rūpnīcās un mājvietu patēriņa precēm Indio, Kalifornijā.<br/><br/>Nelson's Village of Leclaire bija starptautiski pazīstams kā ievērības cienīgs un veiksmīgs eksperiments. Tas tika aprakstīts New York World daudzos gadījumos, bet jo īpaši reportieris Nellie Bly in 1894, kurš rakstīja ilgi par modeli pilsētu, kur "Darba jautājums ir atrisināts, un visi laimīgi mazā ciematā netālu St Louis." The Los Angeles Times regulāri ziņoja arī par N. O. Nelsonu, tāpat kā Chicago Daily Tribune un daudzas citas publikācijas.<br/><br/>Savā runā Leclaire 15 gadu jubilejas svinības 1915, Nelson teica: "Leclaire paplašina jums plaši atvērtu viesmīlību, un cenas jums baudīt šodien vieglumu un komfortu un skaistumu un iedvesmu, ko mēs baudīt katru dienu." Kopš šīs dienas ir pagājis vairāk nekā gadsimts, bet uzaicinājums joprojām pastāv. Iedzīvotāji un pētnieki tiek aicināti uzzināt par Leclaire vēsturi un apsvērt mācības, ko varētu gūt, lai uzlabotu nākamās paaudzes.<br/><br/>Viena no bijušajām ražošanas kompleksa ēkām 2019. gadā, kas tagad kalpo kā N.

| Author Visits via Zoom or Skype<br/><br/>I'm excited to visit with your students via Zoom or Skype! Skype is a great option for schools/classes who aren't bringing in in-person authors, but who want to explore books and poetry, connect with an author, and ask one-on-one questions.<br/><br/>Cost<br/><br/>I offer 30-45-minute Zoom or Skype visits with schools for $125 per session (or $200 for two sessions happening within three hours in the morning or the afternoon; $325 for three sessions in one day; $425 for four sessions in one day). In each session, I try to get kids as actively involved as possible. No, it's not the same kind of connection as an in-person visit offers, but it can still be inspiring and motivating for kids!<br/><br/>What I Do<br/><br/>Each session for up to 50 students includes:<br/><br/>5 minutes of tech set-up<br/><br/>3 segments of 10ish-minutes each — You choose from:<br/><br/>How I became a writer<br/><br/>Writing this particular book (you choose which book I focus on)<br/><br/>Reading (I read some poems and kids help me read others)<br/><br/>Classroom presentation (your students put on a reading or performance for me—a very appreciative audience!)<br/><br/>Writing a poem together<br/><br/>Question and answer session<br/><br/>5 minutes of wrap-ups/goodbyes<br/><br/>I also chat with classes of pre-service teachers or groups of in-service teachers about poetry and writing.<br/><br/>Tips for a Great Virtual Visit<br/><br/>Tips for a Successful Virtual Visit<br/><br/>One of my goals for virtual school visits is to capture the interactivity that makes in-person visits successful and fun. But the truth is that sometimes it's tough to be virtually interactive! The timing might not sync up correctly, which makes reading together a challenge, and it's really hard for me to hear individual students unless they come up and speak directly into the microphone/computer. But after some trial and error, I've discovered some ways to have the best virtual visits possible. Here they are: 10 ways to make my visit with your students a great experience!<br/><br/>Before the Visit<br/><br/>Get kids as excited as possible about the visit. Visit my website with them. Read some of my books with them. Gather some questions students have for me. Anything you do ahead of time to make it feel like a BIG DEAL will go a long way toward student engagement.<br/><br/>Position the video camera or laptop with webcam so that I can see as much of the audience as possible. It's hard to assess student engagement when I can only see a couple of students.<br/><br/>Limit each group to 50 students. It's incredibly hard to engage large groups via video.<br/><br/>I'll move quickly from topic to topic or poem to poem. Please remind students that they'll need to listen closely to understand what's going on.<br/><br/>Occasionally, I do a little Reader's Theater with students. If I send you any scripted student parts ahead of time, print a copy for EACH session and cut into pieces, if needed.<br/><br/>During the Visit<br/><br/>When I discuss a book, if you have that printed book, please hold it up for students to see.<br/><br/>You are my proxy. I often can't call on students and hear individual replies. So, I might say, "We're going to get 3 ideas. Raise your hand if you have an idea." Then YOU take over, call on three students, and announce those answers to everyone in the room and to me.<br/><br/>Choose confident, outgoing students for scripted student parts (if I send any ahead of time). During my in-person school visits, I try to draw out some of the less confident students, but I've found that this doesn't work as well during virtual visits because I can't hear them.<br/><br/>Have students with speaking parts sit up front. When it's time, have them stand up and remind them to speak loudly.<br/><br/>In virtual visits, behavior management falls solely on you. I often can't see exactly what's going on, so do please step in as needed. If there's a big disruption, just ask me to hold on for a moment so that I don't chatter on while nobody's paying attention:>)<br/><br/>Feel free to take pictures of me on-screen and share on social media–even though pictures of me often look ridiculous because I'm making funny faces or something while I read!<br/><br/>If you have any questions at all, please just ask, either before or during the visit!<br/><br/>Scheduling a Virtual Session<br/><br/>Are you interested in scheduling a virtual visit with me? Just email me to set up a date, and we'll go from there | Autors Apmeklējumi, izmantojot Zoom vai Skype<br/><br/>Es esmu satraukti, lai apmeklētu ar saviem skolēniem, izmantojot Zoom vai Skype! Skype ir lieliska iespēja skolām / klasēm, kas nav ienest personas autorus, bet kas vēlas izpētīt grāmatas un dzeju, sazināties ar autoru, un uzdot individuālus jautājumus.<br/><br/>Izmaksas<br/><br/>Es piedāvāju 30-45 minūšu Zoom vai Skype apmeklējumus ar skolām par $ 125 par sesiju (vai $ 200 par divām sesijām, kas notiek trīs stundu laikā no rīta vai pēcpusdienā; $ 325 par trim sesijām vienā dienā; $ 425 par četrām sesijām vienā dienā). Katrā sesijā es cenšos iesaistīt bērnus pēc iespējas aktīvāk. Nē, tas nav tāds pats savienojums kā klātienes apmeklējuma piedāvājumi, bet tas joprojām var būt iedvesmojošs un motivējošs bērniem!<br/><br/>Ko es daru<br/><br/>Katra sesija līdz 50 studentiem ietver:<br/><br/>5 minūšu tehniskā iestatīšana<br/><br/>3 segmenti pa 10ish-minūtēm katrā.<br/><br/>Kā es kļuvu par rakstnieku<br/><br/>Rakstot šo konkrēto grāmatu (jūs izvēlaties, kuru grāmatu es koncentrējos)<br/><br/>Lasīšana (es izlasīju dažus dzejoļus un bērni palīdz man lasīt citus)<br/><br/>Klases prezentācija (Jūsu skolēni likts uz lasīšanu vai sniegumu par mani - ļoti pateicīgs auditoriju!)<br/><br/>Rakstot dzejoli kopā<br/><br/>Jautājumu un atbilžu sesija<br/><br/>5 minūtes aplauzums / goodbyes<br/><br/>Es arī sarunājos ar klases dienesta skolotājiem vai grupu dienesta skolotājiem par dzeju un rakstīšanu.<br/><br/>Padomi lieliskam virtuālā apmeklējumam<br/><br/>Padomi veiksmīgam virtuālam apmeklējumam<br/><br/>Viens no maniem virtuālo skolas apmeklējumu mērķiem ir tvert interaktivitāti, kas padara apmeklējumu klātienē veiksmīgu un jautru. Bet patiesība ir tāda, ka dažreiz ir grūti būt praktiski interaktīvam! Laika sinhronizācija, iespējams, nav pareiza, tāpēc lasīšana kopā ir izaicinājums, un man ir ļoti grūti dzirdēt atsevišķus studentus, ja vien viņi nenāk klajā un nerunā tieši mikrofonā/datorā. Bet pēc dažiem izmēģinājumiem un kļūdām esmu atklājis dažus veidus, kā iegūt vislabākos virtuālos apmeklējumus. Šeit tie ir: 10 veidi, kā padarīt manu apmeklējumu ar saviem skolēniem lielisku pieredzi!<br/><br/>Pirms vizītes<br/><br/>Iegūstiet bērnus pēc iespējas satraukti par vizīti. Apmeklējiet manu vietni ar viņiem. Lasiet dažas no manām grāmatām ar viņiem. Savāciet dažus jautājumus, kas studentiem ir par mani. Viss, ko jūs darāt pirms laika, lai justos kā liels darījums, iet tālu uz studentu iesaistīšanos.<br/><br/>Novietojiet videokameru vai klēpjdatoru ar tīmekļa kameru, lai es varētu redzēt pēc iespējas vairāk auditorijas. Ir grūti novērtēt studentu iesaistīšanos, ja es varu redzēt tikai pāris studentus.<br/><br/>Ierobežot katru grupu līdz 50 studentiem. Izmantojot video, ir neticami grūti iesaistīt lielas grupas.<br/><br/>Es ātri pāriet no tēmas uz tēmu vai dzejoli uz dzejoli. Lūdzu, atgādiniet skolēniem, ka viņiem būs nepieciešams uzmanīgi klausīties, lai saprastu, kas notiek.<br/><br/>Reizēm es kopā ar studentiem daru mazu Lasītāja teātri. Ja es pirms laika sūtu jums kādas skriptētas studentu daļas, izdrukājiet kopiju KATRAM sesijai un, ja nepieciešams, sagrieziet gabaliņos.<br/><br/>Vizītes laikā<br/><br/>Kad es apspriežu grāmatu, ja jums ir šī iespiestā grāmata, lūdzu, turiet to studentiem, lai redzētu.<br/><br/>Jūs esat mans starpniekserveris. Es bieži nevaru piezvanīt studentiem un dzirdēt individuālas atbildes. Tāpēc es varētu teikt: "Mēs iegūsim 3 idejas. Paceliet roku, ja jums ir ideja." Tad jūs uzņematies vadību, pieaiciniet trīs studentus un paziņojiet par šīm atbildēm ikvienam telpā un man.<br/><br/>Izvēlieties pārliecinošus, izejošos studentus skriptu studentu daļām (ja es sūtu kādu pirms laika). Savas personīgās skolas vizītes laikā es cenšos izvilināt dažus no mazāk pārliecinātiem skolēniem, bet esmu atklājis, ka tas nedarbojas tik labi virtuālo vizīšu laikā, jo es tos nedzirdu.<br/><br/>Vai skolēni ar runājošām daļām sēdēt uz augšu priekšā. Kad ir pienācis laiks, tos piecelties un atgādināt viņiem runāt skaļi.<br/><br/>Virtuālajos apmeklējumos uzvedības vadība attiecas tikai uz jums. Es bieži neredzu tieši to, kas notiek, tāpēc, lūdzu, ienāciet pēc vajadzības. Ja tur ir liels traucējums, vienkārši lūgt mani turēt uz brīdi, lai man nav pļāpāt, kamēr neviens nepievērš uzmanību:>)<br/><br/>Jūtieties brīvi fotografēt mani uz ekrāna un dalīties par sociālo mediju, lai gan bildes no manis bieži izskatās smieklīgi, jo es esmu padarot funny sejas vai kaut ko, kamēr es izlasīju!<br/><br/>Ja jums ir kādi jautājumi vispār, lūdzu, jautājiet, vai nu pirms vizītes vai tās laikā!<br/><br/>Virtuālās sesijas plānošana<br/><br/>Vai jūs interesē plānot virtuālo vizīti ar mani? Vienkārši rakstiet man, lai iestatītu datumu, un mēs ejam no turienes |
| News Archive<br/><br/>New book looks at ways in which to tackle HIV-challenges<br/><br/>2011-11-29<br/><br/>Prof. Dennis Francis with Marjorie Human who designed the cover of the book, Acting on HIV.<br/><br/>The HIV pandemic has brought out the best and worst in humans in terms of response. On the one hand it has prompted stigma and violence and on the other it has brought about constructive and supportive responses from various individuals and groups. A new book, Acting on HIV, edited by Prof. Dennis Francis, Dean of the Faculty of Education at the University of the Free State, looks at how drama can be used to promote vital social change as well as individual behavioural change.<br/><br/>Acting on HIV offers a systematic inquiry into drama as an approach to discuss HIV/AIDS and related attitudes and behaviours. The book is a scholarly text and includes the work of some twenty exceptionally creative authors. Contributing authors to the book include, amongst others, Proff. Hazel Barnes (University of the Witwatersrand), Rob Pattman (Stellenbosch University) and Yvonne Sliep from the University of KwaZulu-Natal.<br/><br/>"This project started in 2009 and has taken much of my time to bring together the work of exceptionally creative authors. The research that is communicated through the book is original and timely and makes a significant contribution to conversations about the role/s and significance of drama in addressing issues of HIV & AIDS," says Prof. Francis | Ziņu arhīvs<br/><br/>Jaunā grāmata aplūko veidus, kā risināt HIV problēmas<br/><br/>2011-11-29<br/><br/>Prof. Dennis Francis ar Marjorie Cilvēks, kas izstrādāta vāka grāmatas, Darbojas pret HIV.<br/><br/>No vienas puses, tā ir izraisījusi stigmatizāciju un vardarbību un, no otras puses, tā ir radījusi konstruktīvu un atbalstošu reakciju no dažādām personām un grupām. Jauna grāmata par HIV, ko rediģējis brīvās valsts universitātes Izglītības fakultātes dekāns prof. Deniss Francis, aplūko, kā drāma var tikt izmantota, lai veicinātu būtiskas sociālās pārmaiņas, kā arī individuālas uzvedības izmaiņas.<br/><br/>Darbojoties ar HIV, tiek piedāvāts sistemātisks drāmas pētījums kā pieeja, lai apspriestu HIV/AIDS un ar to saistīto attieksmi un uzvedību. Grāmata ir zinātnisks teksts, un tajā ir iekļauti aptuveni divdesmit ārkārtīgi radošu autoru darbi. Grāmatas autori cita starpā ir Proff. Hazel Barnes (Vitvotersrandas universitāte), Rob Pattman (Stellenbosch universitāte) un Yvonne Sliep no KwaZulu-Natal universitātes.<br/><br/>“Šis projekts sākās 2009. gadā un ir prasījis daudz laika, lai apvienotu ārkārtīgi radošu autoru darbus. Pētījums, kas tiek nodots caur grāmatu, ir oriģināls un savlaicīgs un sniedz nozīmīgu ieguldījumu sarunās par drāmas lomu un nozīmi HIV un AIDS problēmu risināšanā," saka prof. Francis |
| Transcript of Testing the Effect of Ghost Traps on the Blue Crab, Callinectis Sapidus , in Barnegat Bay<br/><br/>Michael FranklinMarine Field Methods16 September 2008<br/><br/>I chose to use the Blue crab, Callinectus sapidus, for my experiment because it is abundant here in Barnegat Bay and it is relatively easy to catch.<br/><br/>Callinectes sapidus is a swimming crab Important to commercial soft-shell crabbers, both commercial and recreational (Jivoff 2008)Main method of crabbing is basic crab trap<br/><br/>Ghost traps occur when a trap is lost yet continues to catch organisms (Breen 1990)John Wnek says there are easily 2,000 in Barnegat BaySince C. sapidus is so aggressive (Pollock 1998) , what happens when they get stuck in cage with no food and what impact does this have?<br/><br/>If caught in a ghost trap, C. sapidus will have cannibalistic tendencies until the last one has died off from starvation.<br/><br/>How do we duplicate a ghost trap in the lab?Create ghost trap by closing of entrances with wire mesh and zip tiesOnce specimen are loaded, close off top with zip ties<br/><br/>Crab entrance closed off with wire mesh<br/><br/>Crab TrapWire MeshWire CuttersRopeCameraZip Ties<br/><br/>How do we get crabs?Trap some a few days early and starve themOnce ready to begin, collect new crabs from trapsAdd directly to ghost trap with 2 from starved tank<br/><br/>Six crabs total, one missingFound small space to escape due; patched up with zip tieTwo crabs deadOne just has claws leftOther missing both paddles and one claw<br/><br/>Four crabs alive and intactLarger dead crab has no changeSmaller dead crab has only section of carapice left<br/><br/>Last day of experimentTook two samplesNo change from second day in first sampleSecond observation, larger carapice separated from rest of body/claw<br/><br/>Based on the results, I reject my null hypothesis that the crabs will simply be in the trap. The results show that they cannibalized two crabs in the trap, then, at least for the duration of my test, were satiated.<br/><br/>Ghost traps do affect the organisms stuck in them, namely C. sapidus.C. sapidus has no problem resorting to cannibalism when no other food source is available.Cannot extrapolate my data over whole bay. | Transcript of Spoku slazdu ietekme uz zilo krabi, Callinectis Sapidus, in Barnegat Bay<br/><br/>Michael FranklinMarine lauka metodes16 septembris 2008<br/><br/>Es izvēlējos izmantot zilo krabi Callinectus sapidus savam eksperimentam, jo tas ir bagātīgs šeit, Barnegat līcī, un to ir salīdzinoši viegli noķert.<br/><br/>Callinectes sapidus ir peldkrabis Svarīgi komerciāliem mīkstu čaumalu krabji, gan komerciālo un atpūtas (Jivoff 2008)Galvenā metode krabju ir pamata krabju slazds<br/><br/>Spoku slazdi rodas, kad lamatas tiek zaudētas, bet turpina noķert organismus (Breen 1990) Džons Wnek saka, ka Barnegat Bay ir viegli 2000Since C. sapidus ir tik agresīvs (Pollock 1998) , kas notiek, kad viņi iestrēdzis būrī bez pārtikas un kāda ir tā ietekme?<br/><br/>Ja C. sapidus tiks noķerts spoku slazdā, tam būs kanibālisma tendences, līdz pēdējais ir nomiris no bada.<br/><br/>Kā mēs dublēt spoku lamatas laboratorijā?Izveidot spoku lamatas, aizverot ieejas ar stiepļu sietu un zip tiesKad paraugs ir ielādēts, aizveriet augšu ar zip saitēm<br/><br/>Krabju ieeja slēgta ar stiepļu sietu<br/><br/>Krabju TrapWire MeshWire griezējiRopeCameraZip Kaklasaites<br/><br/>Kā mēs iegūstam krabjus?Slazds dažas dienas agrāk un badoties tosKad esat gatavs sākt, savākt jaunus krabjus no slazdiemPievienot tieši spoku slazdam ar 2 no badā tvertnes<br/><br/>Kopā seši krabji, pazuduši viensFound maza telpa, lai izvairītos dēļ; patched up ar zip tieDivi krabji mirisViens vienkārši ir nagi kreisiCiti trūkst gan airi un viens raust<br/><br/>Četri krabji dzīvs un neskartsLielāks miris krabis nav izmaiņuMazāks miris krabis ir tikai daļa no karapisa pa kreisi<br/><br/>Pēdējā eksperimenta dienaŅema divus paraugusNo otrās dienas pirmajā paraugāNav izmaiņuOtrais novērojums, lielāka karapīle atdalīta no pārējā ķermeņa/naga<br/><br/>Pamatojoties uz rezultātiem, es noraidu savu nulles hipotēzi, ka krabji vienkārši būs slazdā.

| Storyworld Spotlight<br/><br/>25 years of Tomb Raider<br/><br/>Tomb Raider is one of the most recognizable entertainment properties in the world. Since Lara Croft's first videogame appearance in Tomb Raider (1996), her exploits as an adventurous and quick-witted explorer have resonated widely with players, earning her a place in the pantheon of great pop culture characters. For that reason we will be putting The World of Lara Croft in the Storyworld Spotlight from December 22, 2021 to March 6, 2022.<br/><br/>Crafting a Croft<br/><br/>Lara Croft was created by studio Core Design, in Derby (UK), in 1996. The studio was looking for a lead character for their upcoming a 3D adventure game for PlayStation 1. A game in a 3rd person perspective where players would see the main character in full throughout every scene.<br/><br/>As the game was about 'raiding mysterious tombs deep under pyramids,' the lead character would need to look adventurous, and have the brains to survive complex raiding missions. After some deliberation, Lara Croft was born, a young, upper-class and utterly British woman, who was as enigmatic and intelligent as she was tough and self-reliant.<br/><br/>Success and controversy<br/><br/>Tomb Raider (1996) was a breakaway success for Core Design, who quickly doubled down on building Tomb Raider 2 (1997) and 3 (1998). A big part of the success was attributed to the games' leading lady, who found admirers both with male and female players. This baffled critics who just saw Lara Croft as a sexist cartoon.<br/><br/>Explore The World of Lara Croft in Storyworld<br/><br/>This exhibition explores the successful franchise in-depth. It looks at the history of the games and why its leading lady resonates with so many people. It also dives into the mystery of what makes Tomb Raider games tick, from the deep world building to the clever puzzles and traps, and from fantastic enemy and monster designs to the character design of the legendary heroine.<br/><br/>After all, mysteries are there to explore, and have been for the past 25 years.<br/><br/>Tickets<br/><br/>Buy your tickets for Storyworld online with a start date and entry time from Wednesday December 22.

An option can be used, for example, to give the buyer time to resolve questions of financing, title, zoning and feasibility before committing the buyer to purchase. Options are frequently used in the land assemblage process. The option must be supported by its actual consideration, separate and independent of the purchase price of the property. Mere recital of consideration alone is not sufficient except in a lease-option in which the provisions of the lease are themselves sufficient consideration to support the option. An option merely creates a contractual right; it does not give the optionee any estate in the property. At the time the option is signed, the owner does not sell, nor does the buyer purchase, the property. Although the owner is obligated to sell if given notice by the buyer, the buyer is not obligated to purchase. An option to buy is also known as a call; an option to sell is known as a put. | Nekustamo īpašumu dienas vārds: Option<br/><br/>Variants: līgums uz noteiktu laiku saglabāt atvērtu piedāvājumu pārdot vai iznomāt nekustamo īpašumu. Var izmantot iespēju, piemēram, dot pircējam laiku, lai atrisinātu jautājumus par finansējumu, nosaukumu, zonējumu un iespējamību, pirms pircējs uzņemas iegādāties. Iespējas bieži tiek izmantotas zemes montāžas procesā. Šī iespēja ir jāatbalsta ar tās faktisko atlīdzību, atsevišķi un neatkarīgi no īpašuma pirkuma cenas. Ar apsvērumu vien nepietiek, izņemot nomas iespēju, kurā nomas noteikumi paši par sevi ir pietiekami, lai atbalstītu iespēju. Opcija tikai rada līgumiskas tiesības; tā nedod izvēles ņēmējam nekādu īpašumu. Opcijas parakstīšanas laikā īpašnieks nepārdod, kā arī pircējs nepērk īpašumu. Lai gan īpašniekam ir pienākums pārdot, ja pircējs to ir paziņojis, pircējam nav pienākuma iegādāties. Iespēja iegādāties ir pazīstama arī kā zvans; iespēja pārdot ir pazīstama kā put. |
| Benefits of Carotenoids for the Skin<br/><br/>Have you heard of carotenoids? These powerful phytochemicals are the pigmented constituents found in plants that give flowers, fruits, and leaves their yellow, orange and red colours.<br/><br/>Since the 1930s, scientists have identified about 800 carotenoids and about 40 are found in the human body, including the outermost layer of the epidermis, the dermis and subcutaneous fat. The most common carotenoids are beta-carotene, alpha-carotene, lutein, zeaxanthin, lycopene, and astaxanthin. You can read more about astaxanthin here.<br/><br/>The content of carotenoids in the skin is influenced by numerous factors, including the intake of fruits and vegetables, their bioavailability from various foods, supplementation, exposure to UV radiation, air pollution, alcohol consumption, smoking and stress.<br/><br/>How do Carotenoids Help My Skin?<br/><br/>Carotenoids are some of the best-known antioxidants for the skin and they also have important functions as anti-inflammatory agents.<br/><br/>Healthy Aging and Skin Repair<br/><br/>Antioxidants are essential for healthy skin because they help to prevent free radical damage to cells. Free radical damage causes premature aging and the onset of various types of skin cancers. Carotenoids, along with vitamin E, vitamin C, and Co enzyme Q10 are important dermal antioxidants.<br/><br/>Due to their antioxidant activity, carotenoids support and encourage collagen and elastin production in the skin. This helps to increase the skin's density, thickness, elasticity, and firmness. Collagen and elastin decrease as we age, so getting enough carotenoids in the diet and topically is critical for aging well.<br/><br/>Carotenoids can improve the signs of photoaging, skin discolouration, elasticity, hydration, texture, and can reduce transepidermal water loss.<br/><br/>Astaxanthin in particular stimulates fibroblasts to produce collagen and elastin, inhibits the activity of the enzymes that breakdown collagen and elastin, and shows anti-inflammatory and UV-filtering effects. It has been shown to reduce melanin in the skin, which results in the decrease in the appearance of freckles and melasma.<br/><br/>Anti-acne activity: the anti-inflammatory activity of carotenoids helps to dampen the inflammation and irritation associated with acne. Carotenoids also help to normalize and balance oil secretions from the sebaceous glands. They are valuable agents in skin repair and they stimulate epidermal regeneration, helping to smooth and soften skin.<br/><br/>Where Can I Find Carotenoids?<br/><br/>There are two ways to get your daily dose of carotenoids: through diet and through topical application. The combination of both is the ideal approach to well-aging skincare.<br/><br/>Carotenoids are fat-soluble, so your body needs fat to absorb them (think tomatoes and olive oil, broccoli and butter, or spinach and avocado). Common sources of carotenoids in food are avocado, egg yolks, kale, spinach, carrots, sweet potatoes, papaya, and tomatoes.<br/><br/>While we advocate getting as many of your nutrients and antioxidants as you can from food rather than supplementation; one study showed that astaxanthin combined with collagen hydrolysate significantly improved barrier integrity, reduced transepidermal water loss, and increased the expression of procollagen type I mRNA.<br/><br/>Topical application is key to healthy skin. Studies show that high concentrations of antioxidants in human skin offer the best protection for healthy skin at any age.<br/><br/>At Sarka Botanicals, we blend carotenoid-rich, whole plants such as calendula, dandelion, and extracts like astaxanthin with cold-pressed oils and functional ingredients. Calendula alone contains over 19 different types of carotenoids. This may explain why it has such a long history of use in skin care. Studies show that carotenoids blended with co-enzyme Q10 are especially effective at reducing inflammation and slowing premature skin aging due to sun exposure. | Karotinoīdu priekšrocības ādai<br/><br/>Vai esat dzirdējuši par karotinoīdiem? Šīs spēcīgās fitoķīmiskās vielas ir pigmentētas sastāvdaļas, kas atrodamas augos, kas dod ziedus, augļus un atstāj dzeltenu, oranžu un sarkanu krāsu.<br/><br/>Kopš 1930. gadiem zinātnieki ir identificējuši apmēram 800 karotinoīdus un apmēram 40 cilvēka ķermenī, ieskaitot epidermas visattālāko slāni, dermu un zemādas taukus. Visbiežāk sastopamie karotinoīdi ir beta-karotīns, alfa-karotīns, luteīns, zeaksantīns, likopēns un astaksantīns. Vairāk par astaksantīnu varat lasīt šeit.<br/><br/>Karotinoīdu saturu ādā ietekmē daudzi faktori, tostarp augļu un dārzeņu uzņemšana, to biopieejamība no dažādiem pārtikas produktiem, papildināšana, UV starojuma iedarbība, gaisa piesārņojums, alkohola patēriņš, smēķēšana un stress.<br/><br/>Kā karotinoīdi palīdz manai ādai?<br/><br/>Karotinoīdi ir daži no pazīstamākajiem ādas antioksidantiem, un tiem ir arī svarīgas funkcijas kā pretiekaisuma līdzekļi.<br/><br/>Veselīga novecošana un ādas remonts<br/><br/>Antioksidanti ir būtiski veselīgai ādai, jo tie palīdz novērst brīvo radikāļu kaitējumu šūnām. Brīvo radikāļu kaitējumu izraisa priekšlaicīgu novecošanos un rašanos dažāda veida ādas vēzi. Karotinoīdi, kā arī E vitamīns, C vitamīns un koenzīms Q10 ir svarīgi ādas antioksidanti.<br/><br/>Sakarā ar to antioksidantu aktivitāti, karotinoīdi atbalsta un veicina kolagēna un elastīna ražošanu ādā. Tas palīdz palielināt ādas blīvumu, biezumu, elastību un tvirtumu. Kolagēns un elastīns samazinās, kā mēs vecumu, tāpēc iegūt pietiekami daudz karotinoīdu uzturā un lokāli ir ļoti svarīgi novecot labi.<br/><br/>Karotinoīdi var uzlabot fotonovecošanas, ādas krāsas maiņas, elastības, mitrināšanas, tekstūras pazīmes un samazināt transepidermālo ūdens zudumu.<br/><br/>Astaksantīns jo īpaši stimulē fibroblastus, lai ražotu kolagēnu un elastīnu, kavē fermentu aktivitāti, kas sadala kolagēnu un elastīnu, un uzrāda pretiekaisuma un UV filtrēšanas efektu. Ir pierādīts, ka tas samazina melanīnu ādā, kā rezultātā samazinās vasaras raibumu un melasmas izskats.<br/><br/>Pret pūtītēm: karotinoīdu pretiekaisuma darbība palīdz mazināt iekaisumu un kairinājumu, kas saistīts ar pūtītēm. Karotinoīdi arī palīdz normalizēt un līdzsvarot eļļas sekrēciju no tauku dziedzeriem. Tās ir vērtīgas vielas ādas atjaunošanā un stimulē epidermas reģenerāciju, palīdzot izlīdzināt un mīkstināt ādu.<br/><br/>Kur es varu atrast karotinoīdus?<br/><br/>Ir divi veidi, kā iegūt karotinoīdu dienas devu: ar uzturu un ar lokālu pielietojumu. Abu kombinācija ir ideāla pieeja labi novecojošai ādas kopšanai.<br/><br/>Karotinoīdi ir taukos šķīstoši, tāpēc jūsu ķermenim ir vajadzīgi tauki, lai tos absorbētu (domājiet par tomātiem un olīveļļu, brokoļiem un sviestu, vai spinātiem un avokado). Bieži sastopamie karotinoīdu avoti pārtikā ir avokado, olu dzeltenumi, lapu kāposti, spināti, burkāni, saldie kartupeļi, papaija un tomāti.<br/><br/>Kaut arī mēs atbalstām iegūt tik daudz no jūsu barības vielu un antioksidantu, kā jūs varat no pārtikas, nevis papildināšanu; viens pētījums parādīja, ka astaksantīns apvienojumā ar kolagēna hidrolizātu ievērojami uzlaboja barjeras integritāti, samazināja transepidermālo ūdens zudumu un palielināja izpausmi procollagen I tipa mRNS.<br/><br/>Aktuāla lietošana ir atslēga uz veselīgu ādu. Pētījumi liecina, ka augsta antioksidantu koncentrācija cilvēka ādā nodrošina vislabāko aizsardzību veselīgai ādai jebkurā vecumā.<br/><br/>Uzņēmumā Sarka Botanicals mēs sajaucam karotinoīdus, veselus augus, piemēram, kliņģerītes, pienenes un ekstraktus, piemēram, astaksantīnu, ar aukstās presēšanas eļļām un funkcionālām sastāvdaļām. Tikai kliņģerīši satur vairāk nekā 19 dažādu veidu karotinoīdus. Tas var izskaidrot, kāpēc tai ir tik ilga lietošanas vēsture ādas kopšanai. Pētījumi liecina, ka karotinoīdi, kas sajaukti ar koenzīmu Q10, ir īpaši efektīvi, lai samazinātu iekaisumu un palēninātu priekšlaicīgu ādas novecošanos saules iedarbības dēļ. |
