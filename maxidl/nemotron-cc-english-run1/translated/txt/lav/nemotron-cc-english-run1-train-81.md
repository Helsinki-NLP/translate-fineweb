| Forty-nine years ago today, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act of 1965.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Nearly a century ago, the 15th Amendment to the Constitution stated, "The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of race, color or previous condition of servitude." And nearly a century before that, our nation's founding fathers set in motion the great experiment of American democracy by declaring that "all men are created equal."<br/><br/>The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was a belated acknowledgment that even in America, our foundational ideals carry little weight if not protected by the rule of law. That's why Section 2 of the 15th Amendment granted Congress the "power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation."<br/><br/>And indeed, the codified language of the Voting Rights Act was able to achieve what the Reconstruction-era Congress and Thomas Jefferson could not. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act—and the civil rights movement from which they emerged—served as the catalyst for a dramatic increase in the opportunity for black Americans to participate in the democratic process.<br/><br/>For example, only 6.7 percent of eligible black Mississippians were registered to vote as of 1962; by 1969 that figure had reached 66.5 percent. Today, Mississippi has more black elected officials than any other state.<br/><br/>The protections put in place by the Voting Rights Act were long overdue when they were passed, representative of the arduous struggle with which they were achieved. But unthinkably, these protections are now under assault, jeopardizing the progress our nation worked so hard to achieve.<br/><br/>Last year, in the case of Shelby County v. Holder, the U.S. Supreme Court gutted a key component of the Voting Rights Act that enabled prior federal review to ensure nondiscrimination before any new voting law went into effect.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Sadly, the response of Republican leaders has been to do nothing. Sen. Ted Cruz and Gov. Rick Perry went out of their way to praise the Supreme Court's decision. Sen. Rand Paul dismissed the continued necessity of the Voting Rights Act by noting, "We have an African-American president."<br/><br/>While the election of President Barack Obama was indeed a historic milestone, it is dangerous to think that it absolves us from remaining vigilant against the lingering consequences of our nation's past. The haste with which states have moved to enact voting restrictions is confirmation that the protections put in place by Section 4 are still necessary.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Republican governors have signed strict photo-identification restrictions into law as the solution to a virtually nonexistent problem of voter impersonation, disproportionately hurting women, young people, working families and the African-American community. It's disingenuous for Republicans like Paul to seek the votes of these communities when they believe "there's nothing wrong with" putting restrictions in place that make it harder for these constituencies to vote.<br/><br/>Republicans have also sought to restrict early-voting periods, including the Sunday before Election Day, when African-American churches have had great success with Souls to the Polls programs.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>These restrictions represent a callous effort by Republicans to make voting harder, based on narrow, short-term political calculations that Republicans can win elections by shrinking the size of the electorate.<br/><br/>Democrats have a very different mission when it comes to voting: to ensure that every eligible voter can register, that every registered voter can vote and that every vote is accurately counted.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>The Democratic National Committee's Voter Expansion Project reflects our belief that greater voter participation strengthens our nation and our democracy. We'll continue to use our unmatched institutional knowledge to protect voting rights against legislation and tactics that would attempt to suppress the vote. And because the best defense is a good offense, we're also working to expand the vote by deploying our technology and data resources to register new voters.<br/><br/>On this anniversary, one of the best ways we can honor those who struggled—and in some cases gave their very lives—for the legislation's passage is for Republicans in Congress to join Democrats in passing the Voting Rights Amendment Act to restore the promise of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Democrat, represents Florida's 23rd Congressional District in the United States Congress.

Un gandrīz gadsimtu pirms tam mūsu nācijas dibinātāji uzsāka Amerikas demokrātijas lielo eksperimentu, paziņojot, ka "visi cilvēki ir radīti vienlīdzīgi".<br/><br/>1965. gada vēlēšanu tiesību akts bija novēlota atzinība, ka pat Amerikā mūsu fundamentālajiem ideāliem ir mazs svars, ja tie nav aizsargāti ar tiesiskumu. Tāpēc 15. grozījuma 2. pants piešķīra Kongresam “pilnvaras īstenot šo pantu ar atbilstošiem tiesību aktiem”.<br/><br/>Un patiešām, vēlēšanu tiesību akta kodificētā valoda spēja sasniegt to, ko nevarēja Rekonstrukcijas laika kongress un Tomass Džefersons. 1964. gada Likums par pilsoņu tiesībām un Likums par balsstiesībām, kā arī pilsoņu tiesību kustība, no kuras tās radās, kalpoja kā katalizators dramatiskam pieaugumam attiecībā uz iespēju melnajiem amerikāņiem piedalīties demokrātiskajā procesā.<br/><br/>Piemēram, kopš 1962. gada balsošanai bija reģistrējušies tikai 6,7 procenti melnādaino Misisipi iedzīvotāju, bet 1969. gadā šis skaitlis jau bija sasniedzis 66,5 procentus.<br/><br/>Aizsardzība, kas ieviesta ar vēlēšanu tiesību likumu, bija sen nokavēta, kad tie tika pieņemti, pārstāvot grūto cīņu, ar kuru tie tika sasniegti. Bet neprātīgi, ka šīs aizsardzības tagad tiek apdraudētas, apdraudot progresu, ko mūsu nācija tik smagi strādāja, lai to sasniegtu.<br/><br/>Pagājušajā gadā, Shelby County pret Holder, ASV Augstākā tiesa ķidāts galvenais komponents balsošanas tiesību akts, kas ļāva iepriekšējai federālajai pārskatīšanai, lai nodrošinātu nediskrimināciju, pirms jebkura jauna balsošanas likums stājās spēkā.<br/><br/>Reklāma<br/><br/>Diemžēl Republikāņu vadītāju reakcija ir bijusi nedarīt neko. Sens. Teds Krūzs un Govs Riks Perijs izgāja no sava ceļa, lai slavētu Augstākās tiesas lēmumu. Sens Rands Pols noraidīja vēlēšanu tiesību likuma nepārtraukto nepieciešamību, atzīmējot: "Mums ir afroamerikāņu prezidents."<br/><br/>Lai gan prezidenta Barack Obama ievēlēšana patiešām bija vēsturisks pagrieziena punkts, ir bīstami domāt, ka tas mūs atbrīvo no modrības pret mūsu tautas pagātnes paliekošajām sekām. Ātrums, ar kādu valstis ir pārcēlušās uz balsošanas ierobežojumiem, ir apstiprinājums, ka 4 sadaļā ieviestie aizsardzības pasākumi joprojām ir nepieciešami.<br/><br/>Reklāma<br/><br/>Republikāņu vadītāji ir parakstījuši stingrus fotoidentifikācijas ierobežojumus likumā kā risinājumu praktiski neeksistējošai vēlētāju impersonēšanas problēmai, nesamērīgi kaitējot sievietēm, jauniešiem, strādājošām ģimenēm un afroamerikāņu kopienai. Tas ir liekulīgi, ka republikāņi, piemēram, Pols, meklē šo kopienu balsis, ja viņi uzskata, ka "nav nekas nepareizs ar", ieviešot ierobežojumus, kas apgrūtina šo vēlētāju balsošanu.<br/><br/>Arī republikāņi ir centušies ierobežot agrīnas balsošanas periodus, ieskaitot svētdienu pirms vēlēšanu dienas, kad afroamerikāņu baznīcām ir bijuši lieli panākumi ar Dvēseļu piedalīšanos aptaujās.<br/><br/>Reklāma<br/><br/>Šie ierobežojumi nozīmē republikāņu bezkaunīgus centienus pastiprināt balsošanu, balstoties uz šauriem, īstermiņa politiskiem aprēķiniem, ka republikāņi var uzvarēt vēlēšanās, samazinot vēlētāju skaitu.<br/><br/>Demokrātiem ir ļoti atšķirīgs uzdevums attiecībā uz balsošanu: nodrošināt, ka katrs tiesīgais vēlētājs var reģistrēties, ka katrs reģistrētais vēlētājs var balsot un ka katrs balsojums tiek precīzi skaitīts.<br/><br/>Reklāma<br/><br/>Demokrātiskās nacionālās komitejas vēlēšanu paplašināšanas projekts atspoguļo mūsu pārliecību, ka lielāka vēlētāju līdzdalība stiprina mūsu nāciju un demokrātiju. Mēs turpināsim izmantot savas nepārspētās institucionālās zināšanas, lai aizsargātu balsstiesības pret tiesību aktiem un taktiku, kas mēģinātu apspiest balsojumu. Un tā kā labākā aizsardzība ir labs apvainojums, mēs arī strādājam, lai paplašinātu balsojumu, izvēršot mūsu tehnoloģiju un datu resursus, lai reģistrētu jaunus vēlētājus.<br/><br/>Šajā jubilejā, viens no labākajiem veidiem, kā mēs varam godināt tos, kas cīnījās, un dažos gadījumos atdeva savu dzīvību, jo tiesību akta fragments ir republikāņiem Kongresā pievienoties demokrātiem balsošanas tiesību grozījumu akta pieņemšanai, lai atjaunotu 1965. gada balsošanas tiesību akta solījumu.<br/><br/>Reklāma<br/><br/>Debbie Wasserman Schultz, demokrāts, pārstāv Floridas 23rd Kongresa rajona Amerikas Savienoto Valstu kongresā.

| Q&A: Vatican safeguarding expert Fr Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>13 June 2021<br/><br/>Fr Hans Zollner SJ. Image: Australian Jesuits.<br/><br/>The President of the Centre for Child Protection at the Gregorian University in Rome, and a member of the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors, Fr Hans Zollner SJ, was in Australia in 2018 to speak to Catholic ministry leaders and survivors.<br/><br/>Michael McVeigh from Jesuit Communications sat down with him during the visit to explore how the Church is responding to the abuse crisis internationally, and what can be learned from our experiences in Australia.<br/><br/>MM: This is your third trip to Australia. You've visited quite a few other countries to see how the Church is responding to abuse around the world. Can you give us some idea of what the global picture looks like?<br/><br/>Fr Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>HZ: My understanding, after having visited about 50 countries on five or six continents, is that the Church is really starting to move over the last couple of years on the issue of doing justice to victims, of listening to them, and doing whatever can be done in terms of safeguarding.<br/><br/>I was with the Jesuit Provincials from all over Africa at the end of April, and the President of the Jesuit Assistancy of Africa and Madagascar is very much committed and dedicated to this. He has put up a thorough action plan for formation and for introducing guidelines all over the place. It's a very considerate and very deliberate effort to do whatever can be done to be proactively engaged as Jesuits in Africa — in a continent where until a few years ago all of this was a foreign language.<br/><br/>One of the challenges of trying to develop this global approach is that you're dealing with so many cultures, and so many different understandings. How do you bring this together and try to provide training and support religious communities tackling these issues?<br/><br/>This is one of the major questions we have. I think what I can do is stimulate discussion, stimulate reflection, and prepare people as much as possible so that they can do the groundwork.<br/><br/>The Centre for Child Protection at the Gregorian University does not pretend to have the response to every question. Not only because we don't know the specific contexts — we might know a few of them, but we're talking about thousands of cultures, we're talking about hundreds of languages, we're talking about very diverse legal backgrounds. It varies even sometimes within one country, such as Australia where you have states within the Commonwealth of Australia that have different laws than other states.<br/><br/>I am somebody who tries to elicit and stimulate discussion and reflection. I'm also very happy to listen to people.<br/><br/>You mentioned the need to listen and support victims in being heard. We've obviously had the Royal Commission here in Australia, but what are some of the other ways that you've seen that the voices of victims are being supported around the world?<br/><br/>In France there is one diocese that has established what they call 'The Listening Space'. There, victims can come forward and they can express themselves. The bishop is present. It's an open space in which people who have been hurt tremendously are free at least to express what they want to ask from the Church leadership etc.<br/><br/>There are other places in the USA or in other countries where victims have been invited by dioceses, by Provinces, by the leadership of the Church, to come forward. I have to say that overall I think there is a good will, and there are more people like bishops and provincials who listen to victims than we know. But there is no one model of giving victims not only the space to express themselves and be listened to, but also to engage actively in Church development.<br/><br/>In terms of setting up spaces for support for victims, what are some of the things you've seen that could really help — and that we could be considering here in Australia?<br/><br/>One of the major points that many victims bring up is, 'Can't we have, within parish settings, within schools settings, a regular conversation going on that includes survivors of abuse as regular members of a committee, a commission, a sounding board, a feedback group or something like that?' So that this voice is not only brought in on a specific occasion, or where a person feels like he or she is at a point to be able to speak out about it, but [is heard] on a regular basis — build that voice into the system.<br/><br/>That will help all of us. It will help survivors and victims because they will feel welcome and appreciated in the specific experience, and in the specific life challenges, that they went through. Secondly it will help the community at large, because we can at least make ourselves more and more sensitive to what the concerns and specific needs of survivors are — that can also talk to the needs of young people.<br/><br/>M: We have strong groups of survivors here in Australia who have been able to support each other through that process. But what you're saying is that we need some way of supporting those groups, and supporting those people, through our own institutions as well?<br/><br/>And I think we need to be creative. It will work for one school and one parish and one diocese in one way, and for others in a different way. Because the survivors with whom I am in constant contact, they have quite similar requests, and similar experiences in regard to being welcomed in the Church or not — feeling thrown out or dismissed. But they have also among themselves quite different expectations. So I have learned that you have also to be very forthcoming in accepting the differences in what this specific group, or this specific survivor, wants, requests and needs.<br/><br/>M: Survivors talk about wanting to have their stories heard and acknowledged. We've had the Royal Commission here in Australia, which provided an independent process where victims could come forward. Is there a need for something like that in terms of a truth, justice and reconciliation process for the Church internationally?<br/><br/>H: Yes, I think there is a need for that internationally. But I think first every local church needs to do its own homework. I don't see it happening very soon that some such council or commission would be established to look into this area for the whole Church. The Church has a membership of 1.3 billion people, and is present in 190 countries, with all kinds of differences in expectations concerning psychological, spiritual and financial support.<br/><br/>There is one thing that I have come across consistently in communicating with, working with and listening to victims, and that is that they want to be listened to. So if there was the feeling that victims were constantly being listened to — in Rome and elsewhere — I think that would give a great relief to many victims.<br/><br/>I think [Pope Francis'] concern, especially with regard to your question, is that the local churches do whatever they can so that victims will be listened to in that particular country. I have a list of people who want to speak to the Holy Father directly, and physically it is impossible. I was there in 2014 to translate for two German survivors who were chosen with two Irish and two English survivors when he received the six of them at home. He took the whole morning listening to them one after the other. For each one, he was there for 40 to 45 minutes. Were he to do this for every survivor he couldn't sleep anymore.<br/><br/>His example is modelling for the whole Catholic Church the way victims and survivors are received, welcomed and listened to. I think if the bishops and the provincials in this world, in all countries, followed his example, many survivors would be really appreciative of that.<br/><br/>Archbishop Diarmud Martin was recently quoted just before the World Meeting of Families, about the Pontifical Commission, saying that it's too small as it's currently set up to achieve what it needs to achieve. What's your take on that? Does the Church need to be putting more resources into how it's overseeing those issues?<br/><br/>At the moment we are 16 members from basically all continents, and the major language groups. We represent a variety of disciplines and professions, and the purpose of the commission — as the statutes that have just been promulgated state — is to provide counsel to the Holy Father.<br/><br/>A common misunderstanding about the commission is first that we deal with cases of allegations. That is not the case. We have no juridical or administrative power in regards to cases, because when it comes to allegations of abuse the tribunals and procedure are set.<br/><br/>A second misunderstanding is that we promote, directly, things on the ground. Our first and foremost goal is that we advise the Holy Father on issues.<br/><br/>So from my point of view, yes, we need to invest more. But we need to invest more on the local level, and we need to make sure that the proposals from the Pontifical Commission are forwarded to the Holy Father — which normally the President does — and then there is a follow-up process that reflects what we have given as our advice.<br/><br/>In Australia, Catholic Professional Standards Limited is overseeing the Church's response and providing guidelines and support for ensuring all the institutions in the Church are child-safe institutions. Is there a need for some kind of organisational support from Rome for those bishops and dioceses that are struggling to form these institutions and provide safeguarding in those dioceses?<br/><br/>I think ultimately the commission will develop in that line. They are now in the process of hiring experts in those areas.<br/><br/>I think the Church needs to understand that the local churches can learn from each other mutually. And my understanding has always been — and I think the Holy Father has reminded us — that the Church will not function as a centralised company. It does not work like that, effectively. Every bishop, every bishops conference, has, to some extent, its life on its own. What we need to learn more is to open channels of mutual communication.<br/><br/>There are a number of things that people blame for abuse in the Church. As a priest and a psychologist, and as someone who has met and worked with survivors, what are your thoughts on that issue?<br/><br/>I think the question of where does abuse come from is the most important one, and the Pope has addressed that in his letter to the people of God published on 20 August. He says in the first paragraph, and repeats it over and over again, that the question of sexual abuse is always linked — or almost always linked — not only to the question of abuse of power, but also to the abuse of conscience.<br/><br/>So the real fundamental question of abuse is much more complex than just [the question of] sexuality — be it heterosexual or homosexual. It's a power issue, and there we have to really work on the question of how do we understand priesthood, how to we understand bishophood, how do we understand and live out our ministries? What are the boundaries?<br/><br/>That's why I'm very happy that the Jesuit Province in Australia is establishing a Code of Conduct. Because we don't talk only about sexual abuse of minors. We talk about sexual abuse of adults, and we talk about abuse in other ways — like abuse of conscience, where you dictate to someone what you think, or you pretend to know by God, and you can tell another person, 'You need to do that', against the conscience of that person.<br/><br/>Many people think celibacy produces abuse. As I always say, celibacy as such is not cause for abusing — otherwise how do we explain that 99.9 per cent of all abusers do not live a celibate life, and how do we explain that 95 or 96 per cent of all priests do not abuse minors? But, celibacy, or a vow of chastity, that is not really integrated, that is not really lived out properly — yes, that produces a problem. Sometimes people take to drinking, sometime they take to gambling, and sometimes they take to sexual misconduct, with adults and with minors.<br/><br/>The real question about this is how do we deal with the notion of religious spiritual power with which priests and bishops are invested? How can theology help us to understand, and maybe how can sociology, psychology, or business administration help us to define the limits of power, and the necessity of keeping your boundaries | Jautājumi un atbildes: Vatikāna aizsardzības eksperts Fr Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>2021. gada 13. jūnijs<br/><br/>Fr Hans Zollner SJ. Attēls: Austrālijas jezuīti.<br/><br/>Bērnu aizsardzības centra prezidents Gregora universitātē Romā un Pontifikālās nepilngadīgo aizsardzības komisijas loceklis Frs Hanss Zollners (Fr Hans Zollner SJ) 2018. gadā bija Austrālijā, lai runātu ar katoļu kalpošanas vadītājiem un izdzīvojušajiem.<br/><br/>Michael McVeigh no jezuītu Communications sēdēja kopā ar viņu vizītes laikā, lai izpētītu, kā Baznīca reaģē uz ļaunprātīgas izmantošanas krīzi starptautiski, un ko var mācīties no mūsu pieredzes Austrālijā.<br/><br/>MM: Šis ir jūsu trešais ceļojums uz Austrāliju. Jūs esat apmeklējis daudzas citas valstis, lai redzētu, kā Baznīca reaģē uz ļaunprātīgu izmantošanu visā pasaulē. Vai jūs varat dot mums kādu priekšstatu par to, kā izskatās globālā aina?<br/><br/>Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>H.Z. : Mana izpratne ir tāda, ka pēc aptuveni 50 valstu apmeklēšanas piecos vai sešos kontinentos Baznīca pēdējo pāris gadu laikā patiešām sāk virzīties uz priekšu jautājumā par taisnīguma nodrošināšanu upuriem, viņu uzklausīšanu un to, ko vien var darīt drošības labā.<br/><br/>Aprīļa beigās es biju kopā ar jezuītu provinču pārstāvjiem no visas Āfrikas, un Āfrikas un Madagaskaras jezuītu asistenta prezidents ir ļoti uzticīgs un uzticīgs šim uzdevumam. Viņš ir sagatavojis rūpīgu rīcības plānu, lai izveidotu un ieviestu vadlīnijas visā vietā. Tas ir ļoti uzmanīgs un ļoti apzināts mēģinājums darīt visu iespējamo, lai aktīvi iesaistītos kā jezuīti Āfrikā, kontinentā, kur vēl pirms dažiem gadiem tas viss bija svešvaloda.<br/><br/>Viens no izaicinājumiem, cenšoties attīstīt šo globālo pieeju, ir tas, ka jums ir darīšana ar tik daudzām kultūrām un tik daudzām dažādām saprašanām. Kā jūs to apvienojat un mēģināt nodrošināt apmācību un atbalstu reliģiskajām kopienām, kas risina šos jautājumus?<br/><br/>Es domāju, ka tas, ko es varu darīt, ir stimulēt diskusiju, rosināt pārdomas un sagatavot cilvēkus, cik vien iespējams, lai viņi varētu veikt sagatavošanas darbus.<br/><br/>Gregora universitātes Bērnu aizsardzības centrs neizliekas par atbildi uz katru jautājumu. Ne tikai tāpēc, ka mēs nezinām konkrētos kontekstus, mēs varētu zināt dažus no tiem, bet mēs runājam par tūkstošiem kultūru, mēs runājam par simtiem valodu, mēs runājam par ļoti atšķirīgu juridisko fonu. Tas atšķiras pat dažreiz vienas valsts ietvaros, piemēram, Austrālijā, kur jums ir valstis Austrālijas Sadraudzības ietvaros, kurām ir atšķirīgi likumi nekā citās valstīs.<br/><br/>Es esmu kāds, kurš mēģina izvilināt un stimulēt diskusiju un pārdomas. Es esmu arī ļoti priecīgs uzklausīt cilvēkus.<br/><br/>Jūs minējāt nepieciešamību uzklausīt un atbalstīt upurus. Mums acīmredzot ir bijusi Karaliskā komisija šeit, Austrālijā, bet kādi ir daži no citiem veidiem, kā jūs esat redzējuši, ka upuru balsis tiek atbalstītas visā pasaulē?<br/><br/>Francijā ir viena diecēze, kas ir izveidojusi to, ko viņi sauc par "Klausīšanās telpu". Tur upuri var nākt klajā un viņi var izteikt sevi. Bīskaps ir klāt. Tā ir atvērta telpa, kurā cilvēki, kuri ir cietuši milzīgus zaudējumus, var brīvi vismaz izteikt to, ko viņi vēlas prasīt no Baznīcas vadības utt.<br/><br/>Ir arī citas vietas ASV vai citās valstīs, kur upurus ir uzaicinājušas diecēzes, provinces, Baznīcas vadība, lai virzītos uz priekšu. Man jāsaka, ka kopumā es domāju, ka ir laba griba, un ir vairāk tādu cilvēku kā bīskapi un provinču, kas klausās upurus, nekā mēs to zinām. Bet nav neviena modeļa, kas dotu upuriem ne tikai telpu, kurā izteikties un tikt uzklausītiem, bet arī aktīvi iesaistītos Baznīcas attīstībā.<br/><br/>Runājot par atbalsta telpu izveidi upuriem, kādas ir dažas lietas, ko esat redzējuši, kas patiešām varētu palīdzēt, un ko mēs varētu apsvērt šeit, Austrālijā?<br/><br/>Viens no galvenajiem jautājumiem, ko daudzi upuri piemin, ir: "Vai mēs nevaram uzturēt regulāru sarunu draudzes telpās, skolās, kas ietver tos, kuri ir cietuši no vardarbības, kā komitejas, komisijas, paneļdiskusijas, atgriezeniskās saites grupas vai tamlīdzīgi?” Lai šī balss tiktu ieviesta ne tikai kādā konkrētā gadījumā, vai arī, ja cilvēks jūtas tā, it kā viņš par to varētu runāt, bet tiek regulāri uzklausīts, lai šo balsi iekļautu sistēmā.<br/><br/>Tas palīdzēs mums visiem. Tas palīdzēs izdzīvojušajiem un upuriem, jo viņi jutīsies gaidīti un novērtēti konkrētajā pieredzē un īpašajos dzīves izaicinājumos, ko viņi piedzīvoja. Otrkārt, tas palīdzēs sabiedrībai kopumā, jo mēs vismaz varam padarīt sevi arvien jutīgāku pret izdzīvojušo bažām un īpašajām vajadzībām, kas var runāt arī par jauniešu vajadzībām.<br/><br/>M: Mums šeit, Austrālijā, ir spēcīgas izdzīvojušo grupas, kuras ir spējušas atbalstīt viena otru šajā procesā. Bet tas, ko jūs sakāt, ir, ka mums ir nepieciešams kaut kāds veids, kā atbalstīt šīs grupas un šos cilvēkus, izmantojot arī mūsu pašu iestādes?<br/><br/>Un es domāju, ka mums ir jābūt radošiem. Tas vienā veidā darbosies vienā skolā, vienā draudzē un vienā diecēzē, bet citā veidā. Jo izdzīvojušie, ar kuriem esmu pastāvīgā kontaktā, ir diezgan līdzīgi lūgumi un līdzīga pieredze attiecībā uz uzņemšanu Baznīcā vai nē – sajūta, ka viņi tiek izmesti vai atlaisti. Bet viņi ir arī savā starpā diezgan atšķirīgas cerības. Tāpēc es uzzināju, ka jums ir arī ļoti uzmanīgi, pieņemot atšķirības, ko šī konkrētā grupa vai šī īpašā izdzīvojusī vēlas, pieprasījumus un vajadzības.<br/><br/>M. : Izdzīvojušie runā par to, ka vēlas, lai viņu stāsti tiktu sadzirdēti un atzīti. Vai ir nepieciešams kaut kas tamlīdzīgs attiecībā uz patiesību, taisnīgumu un samierināšanas procesu Baznīcā starptautiskā mērogā?<br/><br/>H: Jā, es domāju, ka tas ir nepieciešams starptautiskā mērogā. Bet es domāju, ka vispirms katrai vietējai baznīcai ir jāveic savs mājasdarbs. Es neredzu, ka ļoti drīz tiktu izveidota šāda padome vai komisija, lai izpētītu šo jomu visai Baznīcai. Baznīcas locekļi ir 1,3 miljardi cilvēku un tā ir pārstāvēta 190 valstīs ar visdažādākajām prasībām attiecībā uz psiholoģisko, garīgo un finansiālo atbalstu.<br/><br/>Ir viena lieta, ar kuru es esmu saskārusies, konsekventi sazinoties, strādājot ar upuriem un klausoties tajos, un tā ir, ka viņi vēlas tikt uzklausīti. Tātad, ja bija sajūta, ka upuri tiek pastāvīgi uzklausīti – Romā un citur – es domāju, ka tas dotu lielu atvieglojumu daudziem upuriem.<br/><br/>Es domāju, ka [Pāvesta Franciska] bažas, jo īpaši attiecībā uz jūsu jautājumu, ir par to, ka vietējās baznīcas dara visu iespējamo, lai cietušie tiktu uzklausīti šajā konkrētajā valstī. Man ir saraksts ar cilvēkiem, kuri vēlas tieši runāt ar Svēto Tēvu, un fiziski tas nav iespējams. Es biju tur 2014. gadā, lai tulkotu diviem vācu izdzīvojušajiem, kuri tika izvēlēti ar diviem īru un diviem angļu izdzīvojušajiem, kad viņš mājās saņēma sešus no tiem. Viņš visu rītu klausījās tos vienu pēc otra. Ja viņš to darītu par katru izdzīvojušo, viņš vairs nevarētu gulēt.<br/><br/>Viņa piemērs ir modelēšana visai katoļu baznīcai, kā upuri un izdzīvojušie tiek uzņemti, uzņemti un uzklausīti. Es domāju, ka, ja bīskapi un provinču pārstāvji šajā pasaulē, visās valstīs sekotu viņa piemēram, daudzi izdzīvojušie būtu patiesi pateicīgi par to.<br/><br/>Arhibīskaps Dirmuds Martins nesen tika citēts tieši pirms Pasaules ģimeņu sanāksmes par Pontifikālo komisiju, sakot, ka tā ir pārāk maza, jo pašlaik ir izveidota, lai sasniegtu to, kas tai vajadzīgs. Vai Baznīcai ir nepieciešams vairāk resursu, kā tā pārrauga šos jautājumus?<br/><br/>Šobrīd mēs esam 16 dalībnieki no būtībā visiem kontinentiem un galvenajām valodu grupām. Mēs pārstāvam dažādas disciplīnas un profesijas, un komisijas kā tikko izsludinātas valsts statūtu mērķis ir dot padomu Svētajam Tēvam.<br/><br/>Izplatīts pārpratums par komisiju vispirms ir tas, ka mēs nodarbojamies ar apsūdzību gadījumiem. Tas tā nav. Mums nav juridisku vai administratīvu pilnvaru attiecībā uz gadījumiem, jo, kad runa ir par apgalvojumiem par ļaunprātīgu izmantošanu tribunāli un procedūra ir noteikti.<br/><br/>Otrs pārpratums ir tas, ka mēs veicināt, tieši, lietas uz vietas. Mūsu pirmais un galvenais mērķis ir, ka mēs konsultēt Svēto Tēvu par jautājumiem.<br/><br/>Tātad, no mana viedokļa, jā, mums ir jāiegulda vairāk. Taču mums vairāk jāiegulda vietējā līmenī, un mums jānodrošina, ka Pontifikālās komisijas priekšlikumi tiek nodoti Svētajam Tēvam, ko parasti dara prezidents, un tad notiek turpmāks process, kas atspoguļo to, ko mēs esam teikuši kā savu padomu.<br/><br/>Austrālijā Katoļu Profesionālie Standarti Limited pārrauga Baznīcas reakciju un sniedz vadlīnijas un atbalstu, lai nodrošinātu, ka visas Baznīcas institūcijas ir bērniem drošas institūcijas. Vai ir nepieciešams kaut kāda veida organizatorisks atbalsts no Romas tiem bīskapiem un diecēzēm, kas cīnās, lai veidotu šīs institūcijas un nodrošinātu to saglabāšanu šajās diecēzēs?<br/><br/>Es domāju, ka galu galā Komisija attīstīsies šajā līnijā. Tagad viņi šajās jomās pieņem darbā ekspertus.<br/><br/>Es domāju, ka Baznīcai ir jāsaprot, ka vietējās baznīcas var mācīties viena no otras, un mana izpratne vienmēr ir bijusi - un es domāju, ka Svētais Tēvs mums to ir atgādinājis -, ka Baznīca nefunkcionēs kā centralizēts uzņēmums. Tas tā nedarbojas, efektīvi. Katram bīskapam, katrai bīskapu konferencei zināmā mērā ir sava dzīve. Tas, kas mums jāiemācās vairāk, ir atvērt savstarpējās saziņas kanālus.<br/><br/>Ir vairākas lietas, ko cilvēki vaino par vardarbību Baznīcā. Kā priesteris un psihologs, un kā kāds, kurš ir ticies un strādājis ar izdzīvojušajiem, kādas ir jūsu domas par šo jautājumu?<br/><br/>Es domāju, ka vissvarīgākais ir jautājums par to, no kurienes nāk ļaunprātīga izmantošana, un pāvests to ir adresējis savā vēstulē Dieva tautai, kas publicēta 20. augustā. Viņš saka pirmajā daļā un atkārto to atkal un atkal, ka seksuālās vardarbības jautājums vienmēr ir saistīts vai gandrīz vienmēr ir saistīts ne tikai ar jautājumu par varas ļaunprātīgu izmantošanu, bet arī ar sirdsapziņas ļaunprātīgu izmantošanu.<br/><br/>Tātad patiesais vardarbības pamatjautājums ir daudz sarežģītāks nekā tikai seksualitātes jautājums – vai tas būtu heteroseksuāls vai homoseksuāls. Tas ir varas jautājums, un tur mums patiešām jāstrādā pie jautājuma par to, kā mēs saprotam priesterību, kā mēs saprotam bīskapiju, kā mēs saprotam un izdzīvojam savas kalpošanas? Kādas ir robežas?<br/><br/>Tāpēc es esmu ļoti priecīgs, ka jezuītu province Austrālijā izveido Uzvedības kodeksu, jo mēs nerunājam tikai par seksuālu vardarbību pret nepilngadīgajiem. Mēs runājam par pieaugušo seksuālu izmantošanu, un mēs runājam par ļaunprātīgu izmantošanu citos veidos, piemēram, par sirdsapziņas ļaunprātīgu izmantošanu, kad jūs kādam diktējat, ko domājat, vai izliekaties, ka Dievs to zina, un jūs varat pateikt citai personai: "Tev tas jādara" pret šīs personas sirdsapziņu.<br/><br/>Daudzi cilvēki domā, celibāts rada ļaunprātīgu izmantošanu. Kā es vienmēr saku, celibāts kā tāds nav iemesls ļaunprātīgai izmantošanai - citādi kā mēs izskaidrojam, ka 99,9 procenti no visiem noziedzniekiem nedzīvo celibātu, un kā mēs izskaidrojam, ka 95 vai 96 procenti no visiem priesteriem ļaunprātīgi neizmanto nepilngadīgos? Bet celibāts vai šķīstības zvērests, kas nav īsti integrēts, patiesībā nav pareizi dzīvots – jā, tas rada problēmu. Reizēm cilvēki dzer, reizēm lieto azartspēles un reizēm izdara seksuālus pārkāpumus kopā ar pieaugušajiem un nepilngadīgajiem.<br/><br/>Patiesais jautājums ir, kā mēs varam tikt galā ar reliģiskās garīgās varas jēdzienu, ar kuru tiek ieguldīti priesteri un bīskapi? Kā teoloģija var palīdzēt mums saprast un varbūt kā socioloģija, psiholoģija vai biznesa vadība var palīdzēt mums noteikt varas robežas un nepieciešamību saglabāt jūsu robežas |
| I'm not surprised by this mismatch. In fact, I'd even go so far as to say this isn't something that will ever change, nor should we get all steamed up about changing it. In 10 years, we'll still have bleeding edge, complex items in the biggest concerns list, and the things we're finally getting around to understanding will be the major parts of our spending.<br/><br/>Now, Gunnar and Andy both have excellent points, specifically about IT teams seeing IT problems and solving them with IT solutions; in fact, I'm positive their points hold merit.<br/><br/>But I think there are other ideas that trump those (I did comment on their blogs about it, and later decided I should just blog here). Those top 3 concerns are bleedingly new such that:<br/><br/>we fear new things because we don't understand them, or don't understand them because they're new.<br/><br/>they're too new for us to have solid approaches to handling them.<br/><br/>they're too new for us to know if we should be worried or not! we tend to default to paranoid/worried, which is good!<br/><br/>too new to have obvious budget items assigned to them. Can I buy a box or some software that provide "cloud security" or "social media security?"<br/><br/>they're so new the business doesn't even know how to use them or what they want out of them. Let alone how we can secure them while still meeting or at least not stomping all over business needs. If the business doesn't even know how to use them yet, I'm not sure security is in any position to guide that usage securely.<br/><br/>It also should be mentioned that these new things are being largely pushed via consumerland and into the business, with IT as a sort of, "Oh yeah," thought. Firewalls, AV, AM, Auth are all IT responses to typically IT issues. Of course there is a difference there. They're also very subjective issues, as opposed to very objective items like firewalls, known malicious bits, behaviors, signatures, ports. Business presents very complex issues that are often involving people (which we can't patch) and that often don't fit nicely into blanket rules. Even if we turned away from technical solutions and devoted our time into solving these problems, they are still not going to be neatly solved. Likewise, when push comes to shove, can you have and meet goals with firewalls? Can you show improvement? All of this flows from the rather subjective non-technical aspect of those issues. Sort of the difference between a child's report card and the feedback you get from a parent-teacher conference. If you have a child, which one would you be most inclined to disagree with or not necessarily believe? (The answer is the subjective one!)<br/><br/>It could be said this is the natural progression of security and technology: from shoring up the technical controls to moving up the stack towards behavior and people. Sure, these 3 top concerns can be said to punch through firewalls and network segments, but that's the nature of those things (social media "punching" through a firewall is far different than me punching through an SSH connection to bridge my home network; social media is akin to the *way* I use my SSH connection after the hold is already punched because it is needed; i.e. social media is the way port 80 is used.)<br/><br/>Basically, all indications point to not being surprised by this dichotomy. And I don't think this is some further indication that IT/security is doing it wrong, or isn't aligned properly with business, or has a technical dark-server-room background. I'm not saying we're doing things right or we're properly aligned, but the above isn't a good argument to support the theory of those deficiencies.<br/><br/>Now for a really big jump. I'd liken the current increase in mobile computing to be as big as the introduction of computers into the business and later the PC/internet into business. Now, I wasn't around when the former happened, nor was I in the industry when the personal computer revolution swept into business, but I would bet that is the closest comparison so far. I may even say the same for social media. These are damned new and they're big changes beyond just bringing in Macs or new software or some new business process. | Es neesmu pārsteigts par šo neatbilstību. Patiesībā, es pat iet tik tālu, lai teiktu, ka tas nav kaut kas, kas kādreiz mainīsies, ne arī mums vajadzētu saņemt visi tvaicēti par to mainīt. Pēc 10 gadiem mums joprojām būs asiņojoša mala, sarežģīti priekšmeti lielāko problēmu sarakstā, un lietas, ko mēs beidzot sākam saprast, būs mūsu izdevumu lielākā daļa.<br/><br/>Gunnaram un Endijam ir lieliskas īpašības, īpaši tas attiecas uz IT komandām, kas redz IT problēmas un risina tās ar IT risinājumiem; patiesībā, es esmu pārliecināts, ka viņu prasmes ir nopelni.<br/><br/>Bet es domāju, ka ir arī citas idejas, kas pārspēj tos (es komentēju viņu emuārus par to, un vēlāk nolēma, ka man vajadzētu tikai emuāru šeit). Šie top 3 bažas ir asiņojoši jauns, piemēram, ka:<br/><br/>mēs baidāmies no jaunām lietām, jo mēs tās nesaprotam vai nesaprotam, jo tās ir jaunas.<br/><br/>tie ir pārāk jauni, lai mums būtu pārliecinošas pieejas to risināšanai.<br/><br/>viņi ir pārāk jauni, lai mēs zinātu, vai mums vajadzētu uztraukties vai nē! mēs parasti noklusējuma paranoisks / satraukts, kas ir labs!<br/><br/>pārāk jauni, lai tiem tiktu piešķirti acīmredzami budžeta posteņi. Vai es varu nopirkt kasti vai kādu programmatūru, kas nodrošina "mākoņdrošību" vai "sociālo mediju drošību?"<br/><br/>tie ir tik jauni, ka uzņēmums pat nezina, kā tos izmantot vai ko viņi vēlas no tiem. Nemaz nerunājot par to, kā mēs varam tos aizsargāt, joprojām apmierinot vai vismaz nestumjot visas biznesa vajadzības. Ja uzņēmums nav pat zināt, kā tos izmantot vēl, es neesmu pārliecināts, ka drošība ir jebkurā stāvoklī, lai vadītu šo lietojumu droši.<br/><br/>Jāatzīmē arī tas, ka šīs jaunās lietas lielā mērā tiek virzītas caur patērētāju zemi un biznesu, izmantojot to kā sava veida domu: "Ak, jā," doma. Ugunsmūri, AV, AM, Auth ir visas IT atbildes uz parastiem IT jautājumiem. Protams, tur ir atšķirība. Tie ir arī ļoti subjektīvi jautājumi, pretstatā ļoti objektīviem jautājumiem, piemēram, ugunsmūriem, zināmiem ļaunprātīgiem bitiem, uzvedībai, parakstiem, portiem. Biznesa dāvanas ļoti sarežģītas problēmas, kas bieži vien ir iesaistīti cilvēki (ko mēs nevaram plāksteris) un kas bieži vien nav labi iederas sega noteikumiem. Pat ja mēs novērsāmies no tehniskiem risinājumiem un veltījām savu laiku šo problēmu risināšanai, tie joprojām netiks kārtīgi atrisināti. Tāpat, kad spiediens nāk, vai jūs varat sasniegt mērķus ar ugunsmūriem? Vai jūs varat parādīt uzlabojumus? Tas viss izriet no šo jautājumu diezgan subjektīvā netehniskā aspekta. Kaut kāda atšķirība starp bērna ziņojuma karti un atsauksmēm, ko saņemat no vecāku un skolotāju konferences. Ja jums ir bērns, kurš no jums visvairāk sliecas nepiekrist vai ne vienmēr ticēt? (Atbilde ir subjektīva!)<br/><br/>Varētu teikt, ka tā ir drošības un tehnoloģiju dabiska attīstība: no tehniskās kontroles līdz kaudzes virzīšanai uz uzvedību un cilvēkiem. Protams, šie 3 top bažas var teikt perforators caur ugunsmūriem un tīkla segmentos, bet tas ir šo lietu raksturs (sociālo mediju "perforēšana" caur ugunsmūri ir daudz savādāka nekā man caurumošanas caur SSH savienojumu, lai tilts manu mājas tīklu; sociālo mediju ir līdzīgs * veidā * es izmantot manu SSH savienojumu pēc aizturēšanas jau ir perforators, jo tas ir nepieciešams; ti, sociālie mediji ir veids, kā ports 80 tiek izmantots.<br/><br/>Būtībā visas norādes norāda uz to, ka šī dihotomija nav pārsteigta. Un es nedomāju, ka tā ir vēl viena norāde, ka IT / drošība to dara nepareizi, vai nav pareizi saskaņota ar biznesu, vai arī tai ir tehnisks tumšā servera fons. Es nesaku, ka mēs rīkojamies pareizi, vai arī mēs esam pareizi saskaņoti, bet iepriekš minētais nav labs arguments, lai atbalstītu šo trūkumu teoriju.<br/><br/>Es gribētu pielīdzināt pašreizējo mobilās skaitļošanas pieaugumu tam, lai tas būtu tikpat liels kā datoru ieviešana biznesā un vēlāk PC/internets biznesā. Es nebiju klāt, kad notika pirmais, es nebiju arī šajā nozarē, kad personālo datoru revolūcija ienāca biznesā, bet varu derēt, ka tas ir līdz šim tuvākais salīdzinājums. Es pat varu teikt to pašu attiecībā uz sociālajiem medijiem. Tie ir nolādēts jauns, un tie esam lielas izmaiņas, ne tikai apvienojot Mac vai jaunu programmatūru vai kādu jaunu biznesa procesu. |
