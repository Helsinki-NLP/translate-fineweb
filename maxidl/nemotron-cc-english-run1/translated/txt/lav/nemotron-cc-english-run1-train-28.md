| There is a well known quote by Plato who once said: "I would teach children music, physics and philosophy, but most importantly music for the patterns in music and all the arts are the keys to learning.<br/><br/>Whatever your religion or culture music will always play and important part. It often defines what is essentially unique about a particular group of people and helps to create a sense of community. Dr Shinichi Suzuki describes his teaching this way: 'Teaching music is not my main purpose. I want to make good citizens. If a child hears fine music from the day of his birth and learns to play it himself, he develops sensitivity, discipline and endurance. He gets a beautiful heart. Along with improving self-esteem and self-expression their are also benefits that include increasing memory and is believed that learning music can boost academic achievement. Although the exact mechanics of this is often not understood, the belief is that learning music stimulates parts of the brain that then have a carry-over impact on all academic areas.<br/><br/>Research indicates that the brain of a musician, even a young one works differently than that of a non-musician. In the field of Neuroscience research has shown that a larger proportion of neural pathways are used in learning music as the brain has to work harder.<br/><br/>There is a link between this and improved spacial-temporal skills that help in solving multistep problems such as in the fields of maths, engineering and the arts.<br/><br/>It also provides structure and focus which may benefit other areas of learning. As well as bringing, structure, organisation and discipline which carries over into other areas of your childs life we must not forget the most important fact about learning music. It brings enjoyment and a sense of fun. | Ir labi zināms Platona citāts, kurš reiz teica: "Es mācītu bērniem mūziku, fiziku un filozofiju, bet vissvarīgākais ir tas, ka mūzika priekš mūzikas un visām mākslām ir mācīšanās atslēga.<br/><br/>Neatkarīgi no jūsu reliģijas vai kultūras mūzika vienmēr spēlē un svarīga loma. Tas bieži definē to, kas ir būtībā unikāls par konkrētu cilvēku grupu un palīdz radīt kopienas sajūtu. Dr Shinichi Suzuki apraksta savu mācību šādā veidā: "Mācību mūzika nav mans galvenais mērķis. Es gribu padarīt labus pilsoņus. Ja bērns dzird labu mūziku no viņa dzimšanas dienas un iemācās to spēlēt pats, viņš attīsta jutīgumu, disciplīnu un izturību. Viņš saņem skaistu sirdi. Kopā ar uzlabotu pašcieņu un pašizpausmi to ir arī priekšrocības, kas ietver pieaugošo atmiņu un tiek uzskatīts, ka mācīšanās mūziku var veicināt akadēmisko sasniegumu. Lai gan bieži vien netiek saprasta tieši šī mehānika, pastāv uzskats, ka mūzikas apguve stimulē smadzeņu daļas, kas pēc tam pārnes ietekmi uz visām akadēmiskajām jomām.<br/><br/>Pētījumi liecina, ka mūziķa smadzenes, pat ja tās ir jaunas, darbojas citādi nekā nemūziķim. Šajā jomā Neirozinātnes pētījumi ir parādījuši, ka lielākā daļa neironu ceļi tiek izmantoti, lai mācītos mūziku, jo smadzenes ir jāstrādā.<br/><br/>Pastāv saikne starp to un uzlabotām spacial-temporary prasmes, kas palīdz atrisināt daudzpakāpju problēmas, piemēram, tādās jomās kā matemātika, inženierzinātnes un mākslu.<br/><br/>Tas nodrošina arī struktūru un orientāciju, kas var dot labumu citām mācību jomām. Kā arī apvienojot struktūru, organizāciju un disciplīnu, kas pārnes uz citām jūsu bērnu dzīves jomām, mēs nedrīkstam aizmirst vissvarīgāko faktu par mūzikas apguvi. Tas rada prieku un jautrības sajūtu. |

| Breaking out of the Box Fay Tsitou investigates moving objects in British museums<br/><br/>Objects are the main 'protagonists' in two different fields: museums and puppetry. In both cases, the objects enable us to interact with our surroundings, our past, and our inner self.<br/><br/>Museum visitors perceive a vast majority of the museum objects from a distance, while these remain mainly static and mute in or outside the galleries' showcases. On the other hand, puppet theatre audiences join the world of moving objects/puppets that are often literally given a voice (sound or speech). Nevertheless, is there a common ground of static and moving objects worth exploring in these contexts?<br/><br/>Museum Puppetry Research<br/><br/>Museum puppetry adopts the language of puppetry within museum exhibitions. It aims at investigating the interaction among museum visitors, objects' stories, exhibits' histories and exhibitions' narratives. It examines how object-centred activities discretely disguise their visitor-centred identity while they enable visitors to free their mind and heart from possible inhibitions or preconceptions. Museum puppetry is a type of museum learning activity, similar to and often combined with museum theatre. However, as G.B. Shaw might say, 'the actor in his primitive form' (i.e. the puppet) unblocks the audiences' imagination which '…plays a far greater part than the exertions of the actors'.<br/><br/>Museum puppetry examples in UK<br/><br/>There are a number of variables that characterise a museum puppetry activity, such as the type of museum, the type of puppetry, the target group, the activity area in the museum, the degree of interaction among the four units (participants, exhibits/collections, puppets, practitioners), the use of verbal and/or object language. For instance, one type of activity could be a complete show around a museum's performing object, as for example in the Keswick museum in Cumbria where Ali Mc Caw presented a wayang kulit style performance, The Musical Stonemason. The show combined shadow and table-top puppetry with a gamelan orchestra which incorporated a museum object, the musical stone of Skiddaw. Moreover, shows can be related to an exhibit's narrative. For example Professor Geoff Felix's popular Punch and Judy street puppet theatre show was presented in the garden of the Geoffrey Museum and at the Museum of London as part of the Victoria Street exhibit (It is no surprise to learn that Felix's beautifully crafted booth was once mistaken for an exhibit as it was standing in an open area at the same museum!)<br/><br/>Other examples include:<br/><br/>A workshop on puppet construction and manipulation - like the skilfully structured workshop that follows Anna Ingleby's shadow puppetry shows<br/><br/>A puppet workshop based on the museum's handling collection - as this happens at the Horniman Museum (London) to acquaint primary school students with the various types of puppets<br/><br/>A puppet exhibit - like the automata or the dinosaur animatronics in the Natural History Museum in London<br/><br/>Creative learning processes with the use of everyday objects - as these are facilitated by Hedsor Creative Learning, to enhance museum interpretation in places such as Sheffield Museums and Galleries Trust and Manchester City Art Gallery<br/><br/>A museum tour with the puppet as a storyteller/facilitator - like Vivien Mousdell's palaeontologist Dr. Ambrose in her puppet show Fossils Alive<br/><br/>An outreach programme - like Jill Webster's interactive puppet show Pirates! All Hands on Deck!, commissioned by Glasgow Science Centre<br/><br/>Manipulation of puppets that belong to original collections is considered par excellence a museum puppetry case - as John Mc Cormick performed with the Victorian Marionettes at the Museum Theatre in London.<br/><br/>The following cases further illuminate the multifaceted potential of performing objects in museums.<br/><br/>'Authentic' metaphors<br/><br/>For twenty-five years adult museum visitors have been enjoying Robert Poulter's New Model Theatre shows in conjunction with special exhibitions and collections, in numerous European and US museums. During Poulter's sophisticated toy theatre shows, paper figures travel smoothly in time and space while interacting with each other and their stage environment. Backdrops are changing continuously. The audience perceives the world represented on stage neither as something static, nor fragmented, but fluidly constructed moment by moment. Although puppetry favours mythological and fictional stories, Poulter makes use of his talent in painting and research skills to interpret selectively historical evidence via flat figures and settings that move vertically and horizontally. The elaborate, live montage evolves as fast and as easy, as the turning of a page. For example, during the art history show Mr Turner Gets Steamed Up, action moves instantly from Margate to London, or from the view out of Turner's window onto the canvas of his famous paintings. The liberties taken with the spoken and visual narrative are noted in detail on the program of the show, allowing Poulter's beautifully crafted paper figures to stand bravely as ultimate 'authentic' metaphors on a miniature stage of History.<br/><br/>Multi-sensory experience<br/><br/>Real coffee beans, shells and cloves cover small wooden boats which sail in a Museum of Docklands' performance originally devised for visitors with the most complex educational needs. The boats' cargo can be smelled and felt as they (metaphorically) travel over the sea to London's Victorian docks in a storytelling piece entitled Over the Sea to London, devised by Emily Capstick and Alison Hale (Peoplescape Theatre). Peoplescape have been creating participatory performances in community, education and museum settings for twelve years. Taking advantage of applied theatre techniques, live music and puppetry's rich potential and flexibility, Capstick and Hale replace verbal description of the past with live action in the present. They create a multi-sensory engaging experience for an audience in-role role with the use of puppets and manipulated objects, without relying on verbal communication.<br/><br/>Popular art<br/><br/>Last year, Dr Matthew Isaac Cohen, as a dhalang shadow puppeteer performed his Ramayana in four parts with the Southbank Gamelan Players at the British Library, where an exhibition under the same title explored how the Indian epic story is retold over the centuries. Similarly to a presentation to an Indonesian audience (who enjoy a great deal of freedom in watching the popular story – spectators can move around, take a nap, leave the show and return!), the Library's audience could watch the nearly three-hour performance seated on pillows or circulating around it. During the show, the spectators could also either move towards the exhibition area to enjoy a museum experience while still hearing the superb chanting and music, or they could go behind the screen and the performers to have a drink while still enjoying the delightful puppet show from the back, viewed through a door opening. While standing in the middle, the wayang kulit Indonesian type of shadow puppetry created an intimate in-between space bridging two worlds: art and life.<br/><br/>Two remarkable cases outside UK<br/><br/>In 2002, a Brooklyn-based constructor/puppeteer, Chris Green, was commissioned to create a part of Noah's Ark exhibit in the Skirball Cultural Center in LA. His sophisticated kinetic or fully manipulated installations – interactive exhibits and puppets manipulated by the museum staff – were made of recycled materials and today attract people of all ages and backgrounds. The Noah's Ark exhibit received awards of excellence from the American Association of Museums and Themed Entertainment Association.<br/><br/>In 2001, the renowned French director Philippe Philippe Genty presented Le Concert Incroyable in the Grande Salle de l' Evolution in the Natural History Museum of Paris. High technology projections of inventive graphic designs were used and interacted with the central exhibit of the gallery: a march that consisted of large mummified animals. This puppet and physical theatre show was a composition of mesmerising images, dramatic action and chorus singing; a unique experience for an adult audience.<br/><br/>So, as we can see museum puppetry embraces a far broader spectrum of practice than might at first be thought! To perceive museums as just another sort of venue, and museum puppetry as a merely a medium suitable to attract preschoolers with their families during Christmas period, is limiting. Recognising the performing objects' potential and communicative power, some museums support their use for their activities and learning programmes year-round.<br/><br/>In fact, these are the museums that foster a close relation between the two inanimate 'soul brothers': museum exhibits and performing objects. In the hands of the experts, such interactions give an extra meaning to an old mystery: '…Inanimate objects / have you then a soul / That clings to our soul / and forces it to love?...' (Alphonse Lamartine, Milly ou la terre natale, 1822)<br/><br/>George Bernard Shaw quotation is taken from his introduction to Max Von Boehn's Puppets and Automata (Dover Publications. New York, 1972, trans. Josephine Nicoll) | Izlaušanās no Box Fay Tsitou pēta kustīgus objektus Lielbritānijas muzejos<br/><br/>Objekti ir galvenie “pretinieki” divās dažādās jomās: muzejos un leļļu mākslā. Abos gadījumos objekti ļauj mums mijiedarboties ar apkārtni, mūsu pagātni un mūsu iekšējo es.<br/><br/>Muzeja apmeklētāji lielāko daļu muzeja priekšmetu uztver no attāluma, bet tie galvenokārt paliek statiski un mēmi galeriju vitrīnās vai ārpus tām. No otras puses, leļļu teātra skatītāji pievienojas kustīgu objektu/kukaiņu pasaulei, kuriem bieži vien burtiski tiek dota balss (skaņa vai runa). Tomēr, vai pastāv kopējs statisku un kustīgu objektu pamats, ko ir vērts izpētīt šajos kontekstos?<br/><br/>muzejs Leļļu pētniecība<br/><br/>Muzeja leļļu māksla pārņem leļļu mākslas valodu muzeja izstādēs. Tās mērķis ir pētīt mijiedarbību starp muzeja apmeklētājiem, priekšmetu stāstiem, eksponātu vēsturi un izstāžu stāstījumiem. Tā pēta, kā objektorientētas darbības diskrēti noslēpt savu apmeklētāju centrētu identitāti, kamēr tie ļauj apmeklētājiem, lai atbrīvotu savu prātu un sirdi no iespējamiem kavējumiem vai aizspriedumiem. Muzeja lelles ir muzeja mācību darbības veids, kas ir līdzīgs un bieži vien apvienots ar muzeja teātri. Tomēr, kā varētu teikt G.B. Shaw, "aktieris savā primitīvajā formā" (t.i., lelle) atbloķē skatītāju iztēli, kas "... spēlē daudz lielāku lomu nekā aktieru aktivitātes".<br/><br/>Muzejs marionešu piemēri Lielbritānijā<br/><br/>Ir vairāki mainīgie, kas raksturo muzeja leļļu darbību, piemēram, muzeja veids, leļļu mākslas veids, mērķa grupa, darbības zona muzejā, mijiedarbības pakāpe starp četrām vienībām (dalībniekiem, eksponātiem/kolekcijām, marionetēm, praktiķiem), verbālās un/vai objekta valodas lietojums. Piemēram, viens no darbības veidiem varētu būt pilnīga izrādīšana ap kādu muzeja performanču objektu, piemēram, Kesvikas muzejā Kambrijā, kur Ali Makkava (Ali Mc Caw) demonstrēja kinoang kulit stila performanci The Musical Stonemason. Izrāde apvienoja ēnu un galda leļļu mākslu ar gamelana orķestri, kurā bija iekļauts muzeja objekts Skiddaw muzikālais akmens. Turklāt izrādes var būt saistītas ar izstādes stāstījumu. Piemēram, profesora Geoff Felix tautas Punch un Judy ielu leļļu teātra šovs tika prezentēts dārzā Geoffrey muzejā un Londonas muzejā kā daļa no Victoria Street izstādes (Tas nav pārsteigums, uzzinot, ka Felix skaisti izstrādāts stends reiz tika sajaukts ar izstādi, jo tas stāvēja atklātā vietā tajā pašā muzejā!)<br/><br/>Citi piemēri:<br/><br/>Darbnīca par leļļu būvniecību un manipulāciju – kā prasmīgi strukturēta darbnīca, kas seko Annas Ingleby ēnu leļļu šoviem<br/><br/>Leļļu darbnīca, kuras pamatā ir muzeja pārvietošanas kolekcija - kā tas notiek Hornimana muzejā (Londona), lai iepazīstinātu sākumskolas skolēnus ar dažādiem leļļu veidiem.<br/><br/>Leļļu izstāde - piemēram, automata vai dinozauru animatronics Dabas vēstures muzejā Londonā<br/><br/>Radošās mācīšanās procesi, izmantojot ikdienas priekšmetus - jo tie veicina Hedsor Creative Learning, lai uzlabotu muzeju interpretāciju tādās vietās kā Šefīldas muzeji un galerijas Trust un Manchester City Art Gallery<br/><br/>Ekskursija muzejā ar leļļu mākslinieku kā stāstnieku/koordinatoru, kā arī Viviena Mousdela (Vivien Mousdell) paleontologa Dr. Ambrose leļļu šovā Fosili dzīvi<br/><br/>Informatīva programma - tāpat kā Džilas Vebsteras interaktīvais leļļu šovs Pirates! All Hands on Deck!, kuru pasūtīja Glāzgovas Zinātnes centrs<br/><br/>Manipulācijas ar marionetēm, kas pieder pie oriģinālām kolekcijām, par izcilību tiek uzskatīta par muzeja marionešu lietu - kā Džons Makkormiks uzstājās kopā ar Viktorijas laika marionetēm Muzeju teātrī Londonā.<br/><br/>Turpmāk minētie gadījumi vēl vairāk izgaismo daudzšķautņaino potenciālu, kas piemīt objektu veikšanai muzejos.<br/><br/>"Authentic" metaforas<br/><br/>Divdesmit piecus gadus pieaugušie muzeja apmeklētāji ir baudījuši Roberta Poltera Jaunā modeļa teātra izrādes kopā ar īpašām izstādēm un kolekcijām daudzos Eiropas un ASV muzejos. Poultera izsmalcināto rotaļu teātra šovu laikā papīra figūras netraucēti pārvietojas laikā un telpā, mijiedarbojoties savā starpā un skatuves vidē. Uz skatuves attēloto pasauli skatītājs uztver ne kā kaut ko statisku, ne kā fragmentāru, bet plūstoši konstruētu brīdi pa brīdim. Lai gan marionete dod priekšroku mitoloģiskiem un izdomātiem stāstiem, Polters izmanto savu talantu glezniecībā un pētniecībā, lai interpretētu selektīvi vēsturiskus pierādījumus, izmantojot plakanas figūras un iestatījumus, kas pārvietojas vertikāli un horizontāli. Izstrādātā, dzīvā montāža attīstās tik ātri un tik viegli, kā lapas pārvēršana. Piemēram, mākslas vēstures skates laikā Tērnera kungs Tvaicēts, darbība uzreiz pārceļas no Mārgeitas uz Londonu vai no Tērnera skata ārā pa logu uz viņa slaveno gleznu audeklu. Brīvības, kas uzņemtas ar runāto un vizuālo stāstījumu, tiek detalizēti atzīmētas izrādes programmā, ļaujot Poltera skaisti veidotajām papīra figūrām drosmīgi stāvēt kā galīgām "autentiskām" metaforām miniatūrā Vēstures posmā.<br/><br/>Vairāku sensoru pieredze<br/><br/>Īstas kafijas pupiņas, gliemežvāki un krustnagliņas pārklāj mazas koka laivas, kas kuģo ar Docklands muzeja sniegumu, kas sākotnēji bija paredzēts apmeklētājiem ar vissarežģītākajām izglītības vajadzībām. Laivu krava var smaržot un sajust, kā viņi (metaforiski) ceļo pa jūru uz Londonas Viktorijas dokiem stāstīšanas darbā ar nosaukumu Over the Sea to London, ko izstrādājusi Emily Capstick un Alison Hale (Peoplescape teātris). Peoplescape jau divpadsmit gadus veido līdzdalības izrādes kopienas, izglītības un muzeju vidē. Izmantojot lietišķo teātra tehniku, dzīvās mūzikas un leļļu mākslas bagāto potenciālu un elastīgumu, Capstick un Hale verbālo pagātnes aprakstu aizstāj ar dzīvo darbību tagadnē. Tie rada multisensoru saistošu pieredzi auditorijai, izmantojot marionetes un manipulētus objektus, nepaļaujoties uz verbālu saziņu.<br/><br/>Populārā māksla<br/><br/>Pagājušajā gadā Dr. Metjū Aizeks Koens kā dhalang ēnu leļļu mākslinieks četrās daļās kopā ar Southbank Gamelan spēlētājiem Britu bibliotēkā, kur izstāde ar tādu pašu nosaukumu pētīja, kā gadsimtu gaitā tiek stāstīts par indiešu episko stāstu. Līdzīgi kā prezentācijā Indonēzijas auditorijai (kurai ir liela brīvība, skatoties populāro stāstu – skatītāji var pārvietoties, nosnausties, pamest izrādi un atgriezties!), bibliotēkas auditorija varēja vērot teju trīs stundu garu priekšnesumu, sēžot uz spilveniem vai cirkulējot pa tiem. Izstādes laikā skatītāji varēja vai nu doties uz izstāžu zonu, lai baudītu muzeja pieredzi, kamēr vēl dzird lielisku skandālu un mūziku, vai arī viņi varēja doties aiz ekrāna un izpildītājiem dzert, vienlaikus baudot apburošo leļļu šovu no aizmugures, skatoties caur durvju atvēršanu. Stāvot pa vidu, wayang kulit indonēziešu tipa ēnu leļļu teātris radīja intīmu starptelpu, kas savieno divas pasaules: mākslu un dzīvi.<br/><br/>Divi ievērojami gadījumi ārpus Lielbritānijas<br/><br/>2002. gadā konstruktors/puppeteers Kriss Grīns (Chris Green) no Bruklinas izveidoja daļu no Noah’s Ark izstādes Skirball Cultural Center Losandželosā. Viņa izsmalcinātās kinētiskās jeb pilnībā manipulētās instalācijas – interaktīvie eksponāti un marionetes, ar kurām manipulē muzeja darbinieki, – tika izgatavotas no pārstrādātiem materiāliem un šodien piesaista visu vecumu un sociālo slāņu cilvēkus. Noah's Ark izstāde saņēma izcilības balvas no American Association of Museums and Themed Entertainment Association.<br/><br/>2001. gadā slavenais franču režisors Philippe Philippe Genty prezentēja Le Concert Incroyable Grande Salle de l' Evolution Parīzes Dabas muzejā. Atjautīgu grafisko dizainu augsto tehnoloģiju projekcijas tika izmantotas un mijiedarbojās ar galerijas centrālo ekspozīciju – gājienu, kas sastāvēja no lieliem mumificētiem dzīvniekiem. Šī leļļu un fiziskā teātra izrāde bija hipnotizējošu tēlu, dramatiska sižeta un kora dziedāšanas sacerējums; unikāls pārdzīvojums pieaugušai auditorijai.<br/><br/>Tātad, kā mēs varam redzēt, muzejs leļļu aptver daudz plašāku spektru praksi, nekā varētu sākumā domāt! Uztvert muzejus tikai kā cita veida norises vietu un muzeju leļļu mākslu tikai kā līdzekli, kas Ziemassvētku laikā varētu piesaistīt pirmsskolas vecuma bērnus kopā ar ģimenēm, ir ierobežojoši.

Almost 20 years later, the challenge of ensuring women's rights remains.<br/><br/>On May 30, the UN Secretary-General's High-Level Panel on the Post-2015 Development Agenda released its report, which contains a standalone goal on gender equality and empowerment of women and girls. In addition, the illustrative health goal contains a target on ensuring universal sexual and reproductive health and rights.<br/><br/>Gender equality and ensuring universal sexual and reproductive health and rights are essential ingredients for sustainable development. We must maintain the momentum gained on these issues in the high-level panel through to the final deliberations at the UN General Assembly in 2014 on global goals for poverty eradication and sustainable development. Now more than ever, we need to recognise the centrality of gender equality. Now more than ever, we must end gender inequality as the grand objective of the 21st century.<br/><br/>Promoting gender equality in the post-2015 agenda includes finishing the work that the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) started. Unfortunately, the MDGs that are most off-track are those directly linked to achieving gender equality, such as reducing maternal mortality and ensuring universal reproductive health and rights. There is by now overwhelming evidence that gender inequality severely constrains women's independence and freedom, control over their own bodies, sexuality and childbearing, and restricts their life choices and opportunities in terms of education and work. There is also abundant evidence that it significantly slows economic growth in both rich and poor countries.<br/><br/>Across the world, in all societies, women and girls consistently face a range of barriers to equality - such as wage gaps, gender-based violence, child marriage and female genital mutilation. The poor and otherwise socially disadvantaged are further marginalised through crippling combinations of gender discrimination and poverty discrimination. Therefore, tackling the gender inequalities and critical barriers that prevent women and girls from exercising their rights and empowering themselves must be at the heart of our efforts to create sustainable, prosperous and resilient societies.<br/><br/>Achieving gender equality - including women's rights, women's health and women's empowerment - is not only a means to eradicating poverty and achieving sustainable development, it is an important end in itself.<br/><br/>Landmark documents such as the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development, and the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action have long established that women's rights are human rights. CEDAW, established in 1979 and ratified by almost every country in the world, places responsibility for ensuring equal rights for men and women with the state. Women must be offered the same access to all aspects of life as men in order to reach equal status.<br/><br/>We have not achieved this yet. Therefore, we are recommending that the UN General Assembly consider effectively tackling this challenge, and the unfinished business of the MDGs, by ensuring that gender equality and sexual and reproductive health are at the centre of the post-2015 development agenda, with relevant goals, targets and indicators approved.<br/><br/>This proposal has strong support among a wide range of stakeholders and development actors, including many governments, multilateral agencies and civil society organisations. The respective national, regional and global thematic consultations on health, inequalities and education in the post-2015 agenda, as well as the Rio+20 outcome document's framework for action and follow-up, have all stressed the centrality of gender equality and women's empowerment.<br/><br/>The MDGs created an unprecedented mobilisation of political will and resources in recent years, not least around MDGs 4 and 5 related to reducing maternal and infant death. Both of these goals are inextricably linked to gender equality and the rights, health and empowerment of women and girls. It is essential for our common efforts regarding these to be carried over and further strengthened in the post-2015 agenda. Including goals on gender equality and sexual and reproductive health and rights in the post-2015 agenda will highlight, once again, the central role of women's rights as human rights. The panel report has given a strong momentum for these issues - now it is up to all of us global actors to maintain it, and make sure that it survives all the way to 2015.<br/><br/>We are at a decisive point in our common history when our policy intentions and actions will shape the future of human development and our planet in the face of both unprecedented achievements and persistent challenges. Let us ensure that the post-2015 agenda is truly universal and inclusive, and that the ultimate goal is a world where all - men, women, young people and children - are treated as equally worthy lens is suitable for general macro work but if you want greater subject-to-lens distance a 100mm lens will give you this at a price.

Gandrīz 20 gadus vēlāk sieviešu tiesību nodrošināšanas problēma paliek.<br/><br/>ANO ģenerālsekretāra Augsta līmeņa darba grupa attīstības programmas laikposmam pēc 2015. gada 30. maijā publicēja ziņojumu, kurā ietverts atsevišķs mērķis par dzimumu līdztiesību un pilnvērtīgu iespēju nodrošināšanu sievietēm un meitenēm. Turklāt ilustratīvajā veselības aizsardzības mērķī ir iekļauts mērķis nodrošināt universālu seksuālo un reproduktīvo veselību un tiesības.<br/><br/>Dzimumu līdztiesība un vispārējas seksuālās un reproduktīvās veselības un tiesību nodrošināšana ir ilgtspējīgas attīstības būtiskas sastāvdaļas. Mums ir jāsaglabā virzītājspēks, kas par šiem jautājumiem panākts augsta līmeņa darba grupā līdz galīgajai apspriešanai ANO Ģenerālajā asamblejā 2014. gadā par globāliem mērķiem attiecībā uz nabadzības izskaušanu un ilgtspējīgu attīstību. Tagad vairāk nekā jebkad agrāk mums ir jāatzīst dzimumu līdztiesības centrālā nozīme.Tagad vairāk nekā jebkad mums ir jāizbeidz dzimumu nevienlīdzība kā 21. gadsimta galvenais mērķis.<br/><br/>Dzimumu līdztiesības veicināšana programmā laikposmam pēc 2015. gada ietver Tūkstošgades attīstības mērķu (TAM) īstenošanas pabeigšanu. Diemžēl visnepiemērotākie TAM ir tie TAM, kas ir tieši saistīti ar dzimumu līdztiesības sasniegšanu, piemēram, māšu mirstības samazināšanu un vispārējas reproduktīvās veselības un tiesību nodrošināšanu. Līdz šim ir pārliecinoši pierādījumi, ka dzimumu nevienlīdzība nopietni ierobežo sieviešu neatkarību un brīvību, kontroli pār savu ķermeni, seksualitāti un reproduktīvo vecumu, kā arī ierobežo viņu dzīves izvēli un iespējas izglītības un darba ziņā. Ir arī daudz pierādījumu, ka tas ievērojami palēnina ekonomisko izaugsmi gan bagātajās, gan nabadzīgajās valstīs.<br/><br/>Visā pasaulē sievietes un meitenes visās sabiedrībās konsekventi saskaras ar dažādiem šķēršļiem līdztiesībai, piemēram, algu atšķirībām, ar dzimumu saistītu vardarbību, bērnu laulībām un sieviešu dzimumorgānu kropļošanu. Nabadzīgie un citādi sociāli mazaizsargātie tiek vēl vairāk atstumti, kropļojot dzimumu diskrimināciju un diskrimināciju nabadzības dēļ. Tāpēc, lai izveidotu ilgtspējīgu, plaukstošu un noturīgu sabiedrību, mūsu centienu pamatā jābūt dzimumu nevienlīdzības novēršanai un kritisko šķēršļu novēršanai, kas liedz sievietēm un meitenēm īstenot savas tiesības un nostiprināt savas spējas.<br/><br/>Dzimumu līdztiesība - tostarp sieviešu tiesības, sieviešu veselība un pilnvērtīgu iespēju nodrošināšana sievietēm - ir ne tikai līdzeklis nabadzības izskaušanai un ilgtspējīgas attīstības sasniegšanai, bet arī svarīgs pašmērķis.<br/><br/>Tādi nozīmīgi dokumenti kā Konvencija par jebkādas sieviešu diskriminācijas izskaušanu (CEDAW), Starptautiskās konferences par iedzīvotājiem un attīstību rīcības programma un Pekinas deklarācija un rīcības platforma jau sen ir konstatējuši, ka sieviešu tiesības ir cilvēktiesības. CEDAW, kas izveidota 1979. gadā un ko ratificējušas gandrīz visas pasaules valstis, uzliek atbildību par vienlīdzīgu tiesību nodrošināšanu vīriešiem un sievietēm ar valsti. Sievietēm ir jāpiedāvā tāda pati piekļuve visiem dzīves aspektiem kā vīriešiem, lai sasniegtu vienlīdzīgu statusu.<br/><br/>Mēs to vēl neesam sasnieguši. Tādēļ mēs iesakām ANO Ģenerālajai asamblejai efektīvi risināt šo problēmu un nepabeigt TAM jautājumus, nodrošinot, ka attīstības programmas laikposmam pēc 2015. gada centrā ir dzimumu līdztiesība un seksuālā un reproduktīvā veselība ar attiecīgiem mērķiem, mērķiem un apstiprinātiem rādītājiem.<br/><br/>Šim priekšlikumam ir spēcīgs atbalsts starp daudzām ieinteresētajām personām un attīstības dalībniekiem, tostarp daudzām valdībām, daudzpusējām aģentūrām un pilsoniskās sabiedrības organizācijām. Attiecīgajās valstu, reģionālajās un globālajās tematiskajās konsultācijās par veselību, nevienlīdzību un izglītību programmā laikposmam pēc 2015. gada, kā arī Rio+20 noslēguma dokumenta rīcības programmā un turpmākajos pasākumos uzsvērta dzimumu līdztiesības un pilnvērtīgu iespēju nodrošināšanas centrālā nozīme.<br/><br/>TAM pēdējos gados radīja nepieredzētu politiskās gribas un resursu mobilizēšanu, tostarp saistībā ar TAM Nr. 4 un Nr. 5, kas saistīti ar mātes un bērna nāves mazināšanu. Abi šie mērķi ir nesaraujami saistīti ar dzimumu līdztiesību un sieviešu un meiteņu tiesībām, veselību un iespēju nodrošināšanu. Ir būtiski, lai mūsu kopīgie centieni attiecībā uz tiem tiktu pārnesti un nostiprināti programmā laikposmam pēc 2015. gada. Mērķu par dzimumu līdztiesību, seksuālo un reproduktīvo veselību un tiesībām iekļaušana programmā laikposmam pēc 2015. gada vēlreiz uzsvērs sieviešu tiesību kā cilvēktiesību centrālo lomu. Ekspertu grupas ziņojums ir devis spēcīgu impulsu šiem jautājumiem - tagad tas ir mūsu visu globālo dalībnieku ziņā, lai to uzturētu un nodrošinātu, ka tas turpina pastāvēt līdz pat 2015. gadam.<br/><br/>Mēs atrodamies izšķirošā brīdī mūsu kopīgajā vēsturē, kad mūsu politikas nodomi un darbības veidos cilvēces attīstības nākotni un mūsu planētu, saskaroties ar nepieredzētiem sasniegumiem un pastāvīgām problēmām. Nodrošināsim, ka programma laikposmam pēc 2015. gada ir patiesi universāla un iekļaujoša un ka galīgais mērķis ir pasaule, kurā visi - vīrieši, sievietes, jaunieši un bērni - tiek uzskatīti par vienlīdz vērtīgu objektīvu, kas ir piemērots vispārējam makrodarbam, bet, ja jūs vēlaties lielāku attālumu starp objektiem, 100 mm objektīvs jums to dos par cenu.

| How Mobile Games Can Help Improve Sanitation<br/><br/>More than 2.5 billion people, many of them in Africa and South Asia, face grave sanitation challenges. In many of these countries, people are more likely to own a cell phone than a toilet. Therefore there is an obvious opportunity to use mobile technology to promote the use of sanitation and good hygiene in order to make a substantial impact. Mobile phones in Kenya transfer money; Bangladeshis listen to English language classes on their phones; and in Ghana, women entrepreneurs use mobiles to market their wares.<br/><br/>The growing Games for Change industry applies principles of traditional social games to address specific challenges . For example, in the UK, Channel 4 commissioned the game developer Playniac to build an online game to improve financial literacy among the 50% of young Britons who are heavily in debt. In Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, young developers have built iPhone, Android, and Javascript games based on local storylines. Pledge 51, a Nigerian developer group, recently released Danfo, a game where the user plays as a bus driver coping with dense Nigerian traffic.<br/><br/>Hattery Labs has begun to explore how games might improve sanitation practices. The typical game-players in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia are young urban males who own smartphones, but many of the communities that face the greatest sanitation challenges have less advanced technology. However, Javascript games built for Nokia S40 phones (among the most popular handsets in the developing world) provide an opportunity to send a compelling message on good behavior practices in sanitation and hygiene. A full report on how games can promote good sanitation and behavior practice is HERE.<br/><br/>Here are a few game ideas that might prove effective:<br/><br/>Soap Wars makes hand-washing an entertaining challenge where players use the soap dispenser as a weapon against dangerous germs. Sanitation Heroes engages players in the process of sanitation maintenance from capturing, transporting, and disposing of feces to reusing it as fertilizer. It features different scenarios in a memory game that prompts the player to match the solution to each different stage of capturing and treating waste.<br/><br/>Toilet Hunt introduces obstacles along the course of finding a safe place to go to the bathroom. As the player searches for sanitary latrines on a basic map, they must use the clues to decide whether the latrine is safe.<br/><br/>There are outstanding questions that the current research hasn't resolved:<br/><br/>How does the game appeal to illiterate players, who need rich visual descriptions and narratives to guide the gameplay? The need for rich imagery does not necessarily match the small, low-resolution screens of Nokia S40 phones.<br/><br/>How does the game appeal to women, who are critical participants in sanitation but don't represent the largest percentage of mobile game players? One initial idea is to frame sanitation storylines as mobile 'comic books', allowing users to scroll through an interesting narrative with subtle sanitation and hygiene messages.<br/><br/>How can the lessons from the game translate to rural areas, where there are fewer who can access it and more who face the challenges that it seeks to mitigate? Urban users might take their phone with them to their home village and share it with their friends and family, who will begin playing the game and continue to play out the game's storyline in real life.<br/><br/>Finally, how can the game measure its impact on sanitation behavior? User adoption and engagement in this context is a false metric to evaluate impact since users might play the game but have their behavior unchanged. Any solution to measure impact should combine a mobile game with other digital and non-digital applications that help users track their sanitation use alongside their game success. Local developers can work in partnership with games for change experts, community organizations, and telecommunications companies to test these approaches.<br/><br/>This report explores the potential of using mobile games to engage citizens in addressing persistent community challenges but we want to hear from you. Is this an effective way to engage target populations? Are there other ideas for how games can impact behavior change? Would you play these games | Kā mobilās spēles var palīdzēt uzlabot sanitāriju<br/><br/>Vairāk nekā 2,5 miljardi cilvēku, no kuriem daudzi dzīvo Āfrikā un Dienvidāzijā, saskaras ar nopietnām problēmām sanitārijas jomā. Tāpēc ir acīmredzama iespēja izmantot mobilo tehnoloģiju, lai veicinātu sanitārijas un labas higiēnas izmantošanu, lai būtiski ietekmētu. Mobilie tālruņi Kenijā pārskaita naudu; Bangladešas iedzīvotāji savos tālruņos klausās angļu valodas nodarbības; Ganā sievietes uzņēmējas izmanto mobilos tālruņus, lai tirgotu savus izstrādājumus.<br/><br/>Augošā Games for Change nozare izmanto tradicionālo sociālo spēļu principus, lai risinātu konkrētus izaicinājumus. Piemēram, Apvienotajā Karalistē, Channel 4 pasūtīja spēli attīstītājs Playniac veidot tiešsaistes spēli, lai uzlabotu finanšu pratību starp 50 % jauno britu, kuri ir stipri parādos. Subsahāras Āfrikā un Dienvidāzijā jaunie izstrādātāji ir izveidojuši iPhone, Android un Javascript spēles, pamatojoties uz vietējiem sižetiem. Pledge 51, Nigērijas izstrādātāju grupa, nesen izlaida Danfo, spēle, kur lietotājs spēlē kā autobusa vadītājs, kas tiek galā ar blīvu Nigērijas satiksmi.<br/><br/>Hattery Labs ir sācis pētīt, kā spēles varētu uzlabot sanitārijas praksi. Tipiski spēļu spēlētāji Subsahāras Āfrikā un Dienvidāzijā ir jauni pilsētas vīrieši, kuriem pieder viedtālruņi, bet daudzām kopienām, kas saskaras ar lielākajām sanitārijas problēmām, ir mazāk progresīvas tehnoloģijas. Tomēr Nokia S40 tālruņiem (vieni no populārākajiem tālruņiem jaunattīstības valstīs) būvētās Javascript spēles sniedz iespēju nosūtīt pārliecinošu vēstījumu par labas uzvedības praksi sanitārijā un higiēnā. Pilns ziņojums par to, kā spēles var veicināt labu sanitāriju un uzvedības praksi, ir šeit.<br/><br/>Šeit ir dažas spēles idejas, kas var izrādīties efektīvas:<br/><br/>Ziepju kari padara roku mazgāšanu par izklaidējošu izaicinājumu, kur spēlētāji izmanto ziepju dozatoru kā ieroci pret bīstamām baktērijām. Sanitārija Heroes iesaista spēlētājus procesā sanitārijas uzturēšanu no notveršanā, transportēšanu, un apglabāšanai fekālijām atkārtoti to kā mēslojumu. Tā piedāvā dažādus scenārijus atmiņas spēle, kas liek spēlētājam, lai atbilstu risinājumu katram atsevišķam posmam notveršanā un apstrādājot atkritumus.<br/><br/>Tualetes medības rada šķēršļus, meklējot drošu vietu, kur doties uz vannas istabu. Tā kā spēlētājs meklē sanitārās tualetes uz pamata kartes, viņiem ir jāizmanto pavedieni, lai izlemtu, vai latrīns ir drošs.<br/><br/>Ir neatrisināti jautājumi, kurus pašreizējie pētījumi nav atrisinājuši:<br/><br/>Kā spēle piesaista analfabētu spēlētājus, kuriem ir nepieciešami bagātīgi vizuāli apraksti un apraksti, lai vadītu spēli? Bagātu attēlu nepieciešamība ne vienmēr atbilst Nokia S40 tālruņu mazajiem, zemas izšķirtspējas ekrāniem.<br/><br/>Kā spēle uzrunā sievietes, kas ir kritiski sanitārijas dalībnieki, bet nepārstāv lielāko mobilo spēļu spēlētāju daļu? Viena no sākotnējām idejām ir veidot sanitārijas sižetus kā mobilās "komiksu grāmatas", ļaujot lietotājiem ritināt interesantu stāstījumu ar smalkiem sanitārijas un higiēnas ziņojumiem.<br/><br/>Kā no spēles gūtā mācība var izpausties lauku apvidos, kur ir mazāk to, kas var tai piekļūt, un vairāk to, kas saskaras ar problēmām, kuras tā cenšas mazināt? Pilsētu lietotāji var ņemt līdzi savu telefonu uz savu dzimto ciematu un dalīties tajā ar draugiem un ģimeni, kuri sāks spēlēt spēli un turpinās spēlēt spēles sižetu reālajā dzīvē.<br/><br/>Visbeidzot, kā spēle var izmērīt tās ietekmi uz sanitārijas uzvedību? Lietotāju pieņemšana un iesaistīšanās šajā kontekstā ir viltus metrika, lai novērtētu ietekmi, jo lietotāji var spēlēt spēli, bet viņu uzvedība nemainās. Jebkuram risinājumam ietekmes mērīšanai būtu jāapvieno mobila spēle ar citām digitālām un nedigitālām lietojumprogrammām, kas palīdz lietotājiem izsekot, kā viņi izmanto sanitāriju līdztekus saviem panākumiem. Vietējie izstrādātāji var strādāt partnerībā ar spēlēm pārmaiņu ekspertiem, kopienas organizācijām un telekomunikāciju uzņēmumiem, lai pārbaudītu šīs pieejas.<br/><br/>Šajā ziņojumā ir izpētītas iespējas izmantot mobilās spēles, lai iesaistītu pilsoņus pastāvīgu kopienas problēmu risināšanā, bet mēs vēlamies dzirdēt no jums. Vai tas ir efektīvs veids, kā iesaistīt mērķa iedzīvotājus? Vai ir citas idejas par to, kā spēles var ietekmēt uzvedības izmaiņas? |
| Sculpins, form a large family (300 species) of small northern fishes living on the bottom in both marine and fresh waters. Though primarily found in shallow waters, some species occur in depths to 1280 m. Approximately 16 species of sculpins exist from the Canadian Atlantic area. The se raven, longhorn, and shorthorn sculpin are the most popular species found in Newfoundland waters. Also known as gurnets, they are sometimes incorrectly called sea robins, grondin and gurnards, which are close relatives.<br/><br/>Sea Scallops: (Placopecten magellanicus)<br/><br/>Sea Scallops<br/><br/>They are also called giant or smooth scallops, are the most important commercial species of molluscan shellfish in Canada. They have two round shells, (with the commercial shell size ranging from 15 to 20 cm in diameter) nad are cream in color.<br/><br/>Sea scallops are found in the northwest Atlantic from the northern part of the Gulf of St. Lawrence to the coastal waters of North Carolina in the United States. In the northern part of this range, they occur in shallow water (less than 18 m) while in the southern portion, they are found in water deeper than 55 m.<br/><br/>The offshore fishery occurs on Georges Bank off the southwestern tip of Nova Scotia. Depending on the area, scallop fishing can be conducted on a year-round basis.<br/><br/>Sei Whale: (Balaenoptera borealis)<br/><br/>Too big to fit in one photo<br/><br/>14 meters; 13 tons.<br/><br/>The sei whale is often confused with the larger blue and fin whales. Its blow is similar to that of a fin whale, but lower and the sei's dorsal fin is more hooked.<br/><br/>The sei shows little of itself when surfacing, although it may poke its head out of the water, it only arches its back slightly and does not show its flukes before quietly submerging. The sei whale is all one slate gray color on top and may be lighter gray underneath.<br/><br/>Look for several blows in succession as the sei lays on the surface resting between its dives. It may be seen in groups of two to five off Newfoundland.<br/><br/>Shrimp (Pandalus borealis )<br/><br/>The little guy<br/><br/>During the 1990s, carapace length statistics of northern shrimp decreased in commercial and survey catches off Newfoundland and Labrador. Decreased growth rates caused by decreases in per-capita food availability due to large population increases, exacerbated by increased metabolic demands from higher water temperatures in the mid-1990s, appear to be the main cause of the size decrease. Fishing could have had an accelerating effect on environmentally driven decreases in shrimp growth and size by 'cropping' the largest shrimp from the population. The greatest decreases in shrimp size occurred in Hudson Strait and the adjacent northern shelf, the area which also has the highest densities and largest shrimp.<br/><br/>Silver Hake (Merluccius bilinearis)<br/><br/>Silver Hake<br/><br/>Silver Hake (Merluccius bilinearis)<br/><br/>Silver hake are members of the cod family, but are more slender and have two dorsal fins. They are dark gray with silver underparts. When freshly taken from the water, they are silvery iridescent, but the bright colour soon fades. Fish in the catch range from 20 to 30 cm in length and weigh between 0.1 and 0.3 kg.<br/><br/>Occurring from the Grand Banks to South Carolina, silver hake are mainly found on Georges Bank and on the Nova Scotia Banks, particularly on Browns Bank and the Sable Island Banks in depths of 55 to 275 m. Silver hake are generally found in the warmer waters of the Canadian Atlantic (7 to 10° C).<br/><br/>Formerly under-utilized in the Canadian fisheries and harvested mainly by fleets of other nations, silver hake were fished almost exclusively by Canadians using otter trawls in the late 1990s.<br/><br/>Silver Hake is sold in Baltimore as Lake Trout.<br/><br/>Skate (Raja senta) [smooth] (Raja radiata) [thorny]<br/><br/>An unpopular sea creature<br/><br/>The analysis of data for the St. Pierre Bank, which is to the south of Newfoundland, shows the average number of barndoor skate fell from about 0.6 million in the 1950s to fewer than 500 in the 1970s Meanwhile, smaller skate species, namely the horny skate and the smooth skate increased in biomass during the same interval. No barndoor skate have been caught on the St. Pierre Bank since the 1970s.<br/><br/>Smelt (Osmerus mordax)<br/><br/>Tiny Fish for Japan<br/><br/>Native to Newfoundland and Labrador. In the spring the sexually mature ripe smelt will leave either the sea or large lakes and travel up streams to spawn. In Newfoundland this can occur when the ice is still on many of the lakes. However, usually this occurs in March, April or May. The precise time depending on latitude and temperature, usually 8.90C is optimal.<br/><br/>It should be noted that the precise time of spawning is quite specific to the individual stream.<br/><br/>Spawning may last up to three weeks, but the peak seldom lasts more than a week. Spawning takes place at night with spawners returning to the lake or ocean by day . The length of both sexes will decrease in size as the period for spawning progresses. Two males will align themselves on either side of a ripe female. The female releases her eggs in clusters, with the milk of both males being released simultaneously. Eggs become adhesive shortly after extrusion, and attach to bottom gravel.<br/><br/>Snow Crab (Chionoecetes opilio)<br/><br/>Snow Crab<br/><br/>Snow crabs are common in the estuary and the Gulf of St. Lawrence, around Cape Breton Island and in the bays of Newfoundland, from Fortune Bay to White Bay. They are also found near Hamilton Bank off Labrador.<br/><br/>Snow crabs live most commonly on muddy or sand-mud bottoms at temperatures ranging from -0.5 to 4.5°C. In the Gulf of St. Lawrence, they are usually found at depths of 70 to 140 m, while in Cape Breton the depth varies from 45 to 245 m, and 170 to 380 m off Newfoundland. The distribution of small crabs is not well documented but they are occasionally found with the adults, or on gravelly bottoms at shallower depths. In some areas, there are indications that snow crabs move from gravel bottom to mud bottom, usually in deeper waters, as they reach maturity.<br/><br/>Sowerby's Beaked Whale (Mesopolodon bidens)<br/><br/>Where's the sexy lifeguard?<br/><br/>5 meters; 1.5 tons<br/><br/>It is also known as the north sea beaked whale, a rare whale of which little is known. It is thought to be mid-ocean whale which occasionally strays inshore feeding on squid and cod<br/><br/>The majority of whale strandings in the Western north Atlantic have occurred in Newfoundland and Labrador.<br/><br/>The Sowerby's is slate gray on the dorsal side and lighter gray on the ventral region. In adult males two teeth are often seen about one third of the way back on the beak erupted outside the mouth. The beak is around 50 cm long. One onlooker said the head looks like a thermos.<br/><br/>Sperm Whale: (Physeter catadon)<br/><br/>No jokes, please.<br/><br/>13 meters; 28 tons<br/><br/>The largest of the toothed whales is often referred to as "Moby Dick." Located at the front of its head, the single blowhole sends a slanted 5-meter misty spray out 45 degrees from its body. Its massive square head and the series of bumps that replace its dorsal fin easily identify the sperm whale It is slate gray. Sperm whales, like the humpback, will throw their tails high into the air when diving.<br/><br/>They are found offshore hunting for squid in deep water, but occasionally can be seen inshore singly or in small groups. | Sculpins, veido lielu ģimeni (300 sugas) mazo ziemeļu zivīm, kas dzīvo uz grunts gan jūras un saldūdeņos.

Populārākās sugas Ņūfaundlendas ūdeņos ir sevene, longhorn un shorthorn sculpin. Pazīstami arī kā gurneti, tos reizēm nepareizi sauc par jūras robiniem, rondiniem un gurnardiem, kas ir tuvi radinieki.<br/><br/>Jūras ķemmīšgliemenes (Placopecten magellanicus)<br/><br/>Jūras ķemmīšgliemenes<br/><br/>Tos sauc arī par milzu vai gludām ķemmīšgliemenēm, kas ir vissvarīgākā gliemeņu komerciālā suga Kanādā. Viņiem ir divas apaļas čaulas, (ar komerciālo čaulas izmēru no 15 līdz 20 cm diametrā) ir krēmkrāsas.<br/><br/>Jūras ķemmīšgliemenes sastopamas Atlantijas okeāna ziemeļrietumos no Sentlorensas līča ziemeļu daļas līdz Ziemeļkarolīnas piekrastes ūdeņiem ASV. Šīs izplatības areāla ziemeļu daļā tās sastopamas seklā ūdenī (mazāk par 18 m), bet dienvidu daļā tās sastopamas ūdenī dziļāk par 55 m.<br/><br/>Atkrastes zveja notiek Georges Bank pie Nova Scotia dienvidrietumu gala. Atkarībā no apgabala, ķemmīšgliemeņu zveju var veikt visu gadu.<br/><br/>Sei Whale: (Balaenoptera borealis)<br/><br/>Pārāk liels, lai ietilptu vienā fotoattēlā<br/><br/>14 metri; 13 tonnas.<br/><br/>Sei valis bieži tiek sajaukts ar lielāku zilo un spuru vaļiem. Tās trieciens ir līdzīgs spuru valim, bet zemāks un sei muguras spura ir līkāka.<br/><br/>Sei maz ko parāda, raugoties uz sevi, lai gan tas var izbāzt galvu no ūdens, tas tikai nedaudz arkas muguru un neparāda savas flukes, pirms mierīgi iegremdējas. Sei valis ir viss viens šīfera pelēkā krāsā uz augšu un var būt gaišāki pelēks zem.<br/><br/>Meklējiet vairākus sitienus pēc kārtas, jo sei atrodas uz virsmas, kas atrodas starp tās niršanas vietām. To var redzēt grupās no diviem līdz pieciem pie Ņūfaundlendas.<br/><br/>Garneles (Pandalus borealis )<br/><br/>Mazais puisis<br/><br/>Pagājušā gadsimta 90. gados ziemeļgarneļu čaulas garuma statistika samazinājās komerciālajā un apsekojumā iegūtajā nozvejā Ņūfaundlendā un Labradorā. Pieauguma samazināšanās galvenokārt ir saistīta ar to, ka 90. gadu vidū palielinājās pieprasījums pēc barības uz vienu iedzīvotāju, ko saasināja paaugstinātas ūdens temperatūras izraisītais metaboliskais spiediens. Zvejniecībai varēja būt paātrināta ietekme uz to, ka garneļu augšana un lielums samazinās, pateicoties ‘apgriešanai’, kas ir lielākā no populācijas garnelēm. Vislielākais garneļu izmēra samazinājums bija Hudzona šaurumā un tam piegulošajā ziemeļu šelfā, apgabalā, kurā ir arī visaugstākie blīvumi un lielākās garneles.<br/><br/>Sudraba heks (Merluccius bilinearis)<br/><br/>Sudraba heks<br/><br/>Sudraba heks (Merluccius bilinearis)<br/><br/>Sudraba heki ir mencu dzimtas pārstāvji, bet tie ir slaidāki, un tiem ir divas muguras spuras. Tie ir tumši pelēki ar sudraba apakšdaļām. Kad tie ir svaigi ņemti no ūdens, tie ir sudrabaini zaigojoši, bet spilgtā krāsa drīz izzūd. Zivis nozvejas robežās no 20 līdz 30 cm garumā un sver no 0,1 līdz 0,3 kg.<br/><br/>No lielajām bankām līdz Dienvidkarolīnai sudraba heks galvenokārt ir sastopams Džordžsa bankā un Jaunskotijas bankās, jo īpaši Browns Bank un Sable Island Banks 55 līdz 275 m dziļumā. Sudrabkarūsa parasti sastopama Kanādas Atlantijas okeāna siltākajos ūdeņos (7 līdz 10° C).<br/><br/>Iepriekš Kanādas zvejā netika pietiekami izmantots un to ieguva galvenokārt citu valstu flotes, 1990. gadu beigās sudrabotais heks tika nozvejots gandrīz tikai ar Kanādas otertraļiem.<br/><br/>Sudrabs Heks tiek pārdots Baltimorā kā Trouta ezers.<br/><br/>Rajas (Raja senta) (gludā raja) (raja radiata)<br/><br/>Nepopulārs jūras radījums<br/><br/>Analizējot datus par Senpjēras banku, kas atrodas uz dienvidiem no Ņūfaundlendas, redzams, ka vidējais barndoru raju skaits ir samazinājies no aptuveni 0,6 miljoniem 20. gadsimta 50. gados līdz mazāk nekā 500 70. gados Tikmēr mazākas raju sugas, proti, rajas un gludenā raja, šajā pašā intervālā biomasā palielinājās. Kopš 20. gadsimta 70. gadiem Senpjēras bankā nav noķerta neviena barndurvju raja.<br/><br/>Omāra (Osmerus mordax)<br/><br/>Tiny Zivis Japānai<br/><br/>Native uz Ņūfaundlendu un Labradoru. Pavasarī seksuāli nobriedušās salakas atstās vai nu jūru, vai lielus ezerus un ceļos augšup straumi, lai nārstu. Ņūfaundlendā tas var notikt, ja ledus joprojām ir daudzos ezeros. Tomēr parasti tas notiek martā, aprīlī vai maijā. Precīzs laiks atkarībā no platuma un temperatūras, parasti 8,90C ir optimāls.<br/><br/>Jāatzīmē, ka precīzs nārsta laiks ir visai specifisks atsevišķajai straumei.<br/><br/>Nārstošana var ilgt līdz trim nedēļām, bet maksimums reti ilgst vairāk par nedēļu. Nārstošana notiek naktī, nārstotājiem katru dienu atgriežoties ezerā vai okeānā . Abu dzimumu garums samazināsies, jo nārsta periods. Divi tēviņi izlīdzināsies abās pusēs nobriedušai mātītei. Mātīte izlaiž olas klasteros, un abu tēviņu piens tiek izlaists vienlaicīgi. Olas kļūst lipīgas neilgi pēc ekstrūzijas un piestiprinās pie grunts grants.<br/><br/>Sniega Krabis (Chionoecetes opilio)<br/><br/>Sniega krabis<br/><br/>Sniega krabji ir izplatīti Sentlorensas grīvā un līcī, ap Bretonas raga salu un Ņūfaundlendas līčos no Fortune Bay līdz White Bay. Tie ir atrodami arī netālu no Hamiltonas bankas pie Labradoras.<br/><br/>Sniega krabji visbiežāk dzīvo uz dubļainiem vai smilšu dubļainiem dibeniem temperatūrās no -0,5 līdz 4,5°C. Sentlorensas līcī tie parasti sastopami dziļumā no 70 līdz 140 m, bet Bretona ragā dziļums svārstās no 45 līdz 245 m, bet 170 līdz 380 m pie Ņūfaundlendas. Mazo krabju izplatība nav labi dokumentēta, bet reizēm tie ir sastopami kopā ar pieaugušajiem īpatņiem, vai uz grants dibena seklākā dziļumā. Dažās vietās ir norādes, ka sniega krabji pārvietojas no grants dibena uz dubļu dibenu, parasti dziļākos ūdeņos, sasniedzot briedumu.<br/><br/>Sowerby's Knābis Vaļu (Mesopolodon bidens)<br/><br/>Kur ir seksīgais glābējs?<br/><br/>5 metri; 1,5 tonnas<br/><br/>Tas ir pazīstams arī kā ziemeļu jūras knābis valis, rets valis, no kuriem maz ir zināms. Tiek uzskatīts, ka vidusokeāna valis, kas reizēm nomaldās krastā, barojoties ar kalmāriem un mencām<br/><br/>Lielākā daļa vaļu strandinga Atlantijas okeāna rietumu daļā ir notikusi Ņūfaundlendā un Labradorā.<br/><br/>Sowerby's ir pelēks uz muguras puses un vieglāks pelēks ventrālajā reģionā. Pieaugušiem vīriešiem divi zobi bieži tiek novēroti apmēram trešdaļa no ceļa atpakaļ uz knābja izvirda ārpus mutes. Pīķis ir apmēram 50 cm garš. Viens skatītājs teica, ka galva izskatās kā termoss.<br/><br/>Spermas valis: (Physeter katadon)<br/><br/>Bez jokiem, lūdzu.<br/><br/>13 metri; 28 tonnas<br/><br/>Lielākais no zobainajiem vaļiem bieži tiek saukts par "Moby Dick". Atrodas galvas priekšpusē, viena trieciena caurums nosūta slīpu 5 metru miglainu izsmidzināšanas 45 grādus no ķermeņa. Tās masīvā kvadrātveida galva un izciļņu sērija, kas aizstāj muguras spuru, viegli identificē spermu. Tas ir šīferis pelēks. Spermas vaļi, tāpat kā kuprītis, niršanas laikā metīs astes augstu gaisā.<br/><br/>Tie ir sastopami atklātā jūrā medījot kalmārus dziļā ūdenī, bet reizēm tos var redzēt krastā pa vienam vai nelielās grupās. |
