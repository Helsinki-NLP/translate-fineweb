| Smith Chuck - Through the Bible C2000 SeriesShall we turn to the book of Acts, chapter one, as we begin our study of the early church.<br/>Luke, the author of the book of Acts, a companion of Paul the apostle, who was author also of the Gospel According to Luke, wrote these two treatises to a friend, Theophilus. Theophilus is a Greek name. It's a name that has a beautiful meaning. The name means lover of God. There are some who believe that it was not a man at all, but that the gospel and the book of Acts were addressed to the lovers of God, whoever you may be. There are other traditions that say that Theophilus was actually Luke's master. That in those days physicians were slaves, usually the slave of a wealthy patron. So that Luke's master was Theophilus, and he released Luke to be with Paul on the missionary journeys. Thus, Luke is writing back to his former master. This is an early tradition of the church, but it is, of course, impossible to prove, like so many of the traditions.<br/>There are also those who believe that when Paul was in Troas and he received a vision of a man calling unto him saying, "Come over to Macedonia and help us," that that man in Paul's vision was none other than Luke. For the first one that Paul really met when he came to Macedonia was Luke. And as we are in the book of Acts, you will find that when we get to that portion of the book of Acts, Luke begins to write more in the first person rather than the third person. So it is, evidently, at this particular point in the Acts of the Apostles that Luke became a companion of Paul and began to journey with him. He began to use the pronouns "we" and "us" instead of "they" and "them." This is, no doubt, where Luke became a participant and an eyewitness of those things that were happening from this point on. We will bring this out to you when we get to that point.<br/>He begins the Acts of the Apostles by tying it with the Gospel According to Luke. It is interesting that the very last thing that Luke records in his gospel is the very first thing he records in the Acts of the Apostles. We find the gospel of Luke closing as Jesus is telling His disciples to wait in Jerusalem until they be endued with power from on high. And then Jesus ascended up into heaven, and so he closes the gospel. In opening the Acts of the Apostles, he writes,<br/>The former treatise [that is, the Gospel According to Luke,] have I written unto you, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and teach ( Act 1:1 ),<br/>The key word is began. The Gospel According to Luke is not the full story of the ministry of Jesus Christ. It is only the beginning of the ministry of Jesus Christ. Jesus continues to minister to the needs of people. Jesus continues to heal the sick. Jesus continues to raise the dead. Jesus continues to minister His love and His gospel to the world, only now He is ministering through those disciples who have been anointed with His Holy Spirit. But the ministry of Christ is continuing; basically, is the premise that Luke takes in the Acts of the Apostles. The former treatise of all that Jesus began, both to do and to teach.<br/>Now because of that, the Acts of the Apostles is an unfinished book: in that the Lord today continues to work through the lives of those who have dedicated themselves to be the instruments of God. To be led and guided and anointed by His Holy Spirit, to continue the ministry of Jesus in the world today. Now God has ordained that His work should be accomplished through human instruments. I do not say that it must be accomplished. God can use angelic beings for His work, and there will come a time, during the book of Revelation when God will use angels to proclaim His gospel to people all over the world. Revelation, chapter 14, "The first angel flying through the midst of heaven having the everlasting gospel" ( Rev 14:6 ). But at the present time, God has chosen to use human instruments. As imperfect as they may be, yet that's what God has ordained to use. The exciting thing about that is, God will use me and God will use you. So many times, we're begging off, "O Lord, I can't speak. I've never been able to speak before or even now, Lord." As Moses tried to beg off the call of God. Jeremiah said, "Lord, I'm just a kid; no one's going to listen to me." And we all have our excuses why we can't be used. Don't we? We all know the reasons why God couldn't use us.<br/>One time, as the Lord was calling a prophet to do His work, he said, "Lord, send whoever you want." The Lord said, "Hey, I've called you." "Lord, good idea; send whoever you want." So often we're in that position, "Lord, send by the hand of whomsoever you will, anybody but me Lord." And yet, God has ordained to use us.<br/>Now, each of us can show our own imperfections. Each of us can point out our own inabilities, and all of us can find an excuse why God wouldn't want to use me. But yet, God has chosen to use you. That through your life He might reveal Himself to a needy world. You wonder when God has such instruments to use how He ever got the job done, don't you?<br/>Until the day in which he was taken up, after that he through the Holy Spirit had given commandments to the apostles whom he had chosen ( Act 1:2 ):<br/>That is what he ended the Gospel of Luke with. The day that Jesus was taken up, after He had told the apostles to wait for the endowment of power.<br/>To whom he also [that is the apostles he also] showed himself alive to them after his passion [or death] by many infallible proofs ( Act 1:3 ),<br/>It is difficult to deny the fact of the resurrection of Jesus Christ. I was amused, as well as annoyed and irritated, by an article I read in the Santa Ana Register this last Saturday. Of the creation science and evolutionary theories being presented in the county schools. How that, this one professor said that he teaches a science class, and thus, they deal only in facts, and that they don't have any place for theories. Because science is based upon fact and creation is based upon religious superstitions. It takes a lot of faith to believe the religious theories. When you are dealing with facts, you can just accept them. I thought, "Very interesting in that science class, they taught me it was a fact that the world was four billion years old. Now today they are teaching it's a fact that the world is twelve billion years old. And it wasn't that long ago that I went to school."<br/>It's interesting that the Bible has never needed to be revised or updated to meet the current data that men have discovered. And yet, if you would take my high school science textbooks today and try to teach a science class from them, you would find that many of the things that were taught as scientific fact when I was in high school are no longer recognized as scientific fact. The simple cell protoplasm is no longer a simple cell, but extremely complex. If there is any fact that can be attested to in history it is the fact of the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.<br/>We have a jurisprudence system that is based upon the testimony of witnesses. If a man is accused of a crime and there are people who witnessed that crime while it was being committed, and they are brought to the standard, and they swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help them God. And in their questioning they affirm that, "I saw that man in the bank on May twenty-third. I saw him pull out a gun from his coat. I heard him demand that all of the money be given to him. I saw him as he left the bank. I saw him as the officer apprehended him outside." And if you can get three or four witnesses to point to that man and will keep their testimony under cross-examination, that man is judged to be guilty. He is the one who did it. We have two or three witnesses that are testifying the same story about that man, and it is accepted as fact that he is the one who perpetrated the crime and is guilty. You've got witnesses who have sworn to tell the truth that are verifying.<br/>After the death of Jesus, when He rose again, He appeared unto many different people who gave sworn testimony that they saw Him. That they talked to Him, that He appeared to them in various places under different circumstances. And for a period of forty days was visiting with them. And at one time, up to as many as five hundred people who were gathered at one place, He appeared. It's difficult to just cast aside or deny the witness of these people. To do so is to discredit our whole jurisprudence system. But not only that, these men who testified that they saw the risen Lord, that they talked to Him, that they ate with Him, they, all of them, with the exception of one, met violent deaths at the hands of other people because of their affirming that the story they told was true. You talk about witnesses sworn to tell the truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth. If a person's life was threatened because of that witness, and it was a lie, at least one them would've broken under the pressure. They would've confessed to the entire hoax. "He showed Himself alive after His passion by many infallible proofs."<br/>being seen of them for forty days, speaking to them of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God ( Act 1:3 ):<br/>Sometimes we fault the disciples because of their questions of the timing of the kingdom of God. Let it be remembered that the kingdom of God was the favorite subject of Jesus Christ. He was always talking about the kingdom of God, and it is a great hope that He was planting into the hearts of all men. Things are not always going to continue corrupted as they are. The world is not going to go forever under the power of darkness, under the bondage of evil. God is going to one day establish His kingdom upon the earth. A kingdom of righteous joy and peace. "Jesus shall reign, where ere the sun doth her successive journeys run. And His kingdom will extend from shore to shore." And that day will be the most glorious day the world has ever seen, as sickness and suffering and pain will be abolished in His kingdom. As sin and greed and these things that have made the world such an intolerable place will be abolished in His kingdom. The godless commercialism, the exploitation of man, all of these things abolished in His glorious kingdom when He reigns. No wonder the disciples were anxious to get it on. I'm anxious to get it on; I'm anxious for His kingdom to come. And Jesus told us when we pray, the first petition is, "Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven" ( Mat 6:10 ). This is the right kind of a desire that we should all have. I desire the kingdom of God. And so He was talking to them, during this forty-day period, of the kingdom.<br/>And, being assembled together with them, he commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which, saith he, you have heard of me ( Act 1:4 ).<br/>He said, "Now look, wait here in Jerusalem until you receive the promise of the Father." This promise that He is referring to is, no doubt, the promise in Joel where the Lord promised, "And it shall come to pass in the later days, saith the Lord, that I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and daughters will prophesy, and your young men shall dream dreams, your old men shall see visions: and upon my servants and my handmaidens shall I pour out my Spirit, saith the Lord" ( Joe 2:28-29 ). The promise of the Father: the day is going to come when God is going to pour out His Spirit upon all flesh, all of the believers. They will, each one, receive that dynamic from God.<br/>For John [He said,] truly baptized with water; but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now ( Act 1:5 ).<br/>The idea of baptism was that of emersion, the bapteedzo. John baptized with water, submerged the people in water, "you're going to be submerged in the Holy Spirit in not many days."<br/>Now when they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, will you at this time restore the kingdom to Israel? ( Act 1:6 )<br/>"When is it going to be, Lord? When's the time for this restoration?" And Jesus is talking to them now, not about the kingdom, but about the power that they're going to receive for service. And so He brushes aside their question.<br/>Saying unto them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father has put in his own power ( Act 1:7 ).<br/>"It's not for you to know." They lived constantly in the anticipation of the immediate setting up of the kingdom. During the entire lifetime of Jesus, they were expecting Him at any moment to go into the phone booth and come out as the savior of the world. Shazzam! Showing His power and overthrowing the governments of the world, establishing God's kingdom upon the earth. And they were waiting daily for this change to transpire. And whenever Jesus would talk about going to Jerusalem, being turned over into the hands of sinful man, and then being crucified, "Oh, oh no, Lord. No, no you don't understand the kingdom, Lord. Be that far from Thee." When Jesus died on the cross, they were all greatly disappointed.<br/>The two disciples on the road to Emmaus, so sad. "Hey, fellows. How come you're so sad as your walking along?" "What do you mean? You must be a stranger around here if you don't know the things that have been happening lately in Jerusalem." "What things?" "Oh, a fellow by the name of Jesus of Nazareth...oh man, it was mighty and powerful. The anointing of God was upon His life. We had hoped that in Him was the deliverance of Israel, but they crucified Him. We had hoped . . . now it's dead." Now He's risen, and He's saying, "In a few days, fellows, you're going to receive the promise of the Father." "Oh, what promise? The promise of the establishing of the kingdom?" You see, it was legitimate that they should ask. "Is this it Lord? Alright! Is this the time? Are you going to set up your kingdom now?" "No. It's not for you to know those times that the Father's appointed or that the Father has in His own power. But, you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you."<br/>Now here, the Greek preposition epi is used to signify a new relationship that they were to have with the Holy Spirit. In the Gospel According to John, chapter 14, as Jesus is there promising to send the Holy Spirit, He said, "I will not leave you comfortless. I will come to you, and I will pray the Father, and He will send to you another comforter, even the Spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth Him not neither knows Him, but you know Him for He dwells with you, and He shall be in you" ( Joh 14:17-18 ). Same Greek preposition as ours, only they spell it "en" instead of "in." Two-fold relationship there in John: He is with you, but He's going to be dwelling in you. But now Jesus said you're going to receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you. The Greek preposition epi, which is translated in different texts throughout the New Testament as "upon" or "over" or I like it, "overflows."<br/>In the seventh chapter of the gospel of John: "On the last day, the great day of the feast when Jesus stood there on the Temple Mount and cried to the people, 'If any man thirst let him come unto Me and drink: and he who drinks of the water that I give, out of his innermost being there will gush torrents of living water.'" John said, "This spake He of the Spirit, which was not yet given which they who believe on Him should receive" ( Joh 7:37-39 ). What did He speak of the Spirit? That it would be like a torrent of living water flowing out. I like, "When the Spirit overflows you," upon you, or over you, or overflows from you. So the three-fold relationship: He is with you prior to your conversion, He is the one who causes you to realize that you are a sinner, He is the one who points to Jesus Christ as the answer as He convinces the world of sin, of righteous, and of judgment. The moment you open your life and heart to Jesus Christ and invite Him to come in, the Holy Spirit comes and begins to indwell you. He shall be in you. "Know ye not that you are not your own, you have been bought with a price, therefore glorify God in your body and your spirit which are His. And know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit which is in you? Be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess, but be filled, or be ye being filled with the Spirit" ( 1Co 6:19-20 ,Eph 5:18 ). But now here's a third relationship. This is an empowering experience.<br/>You will receive [the dunamus] the dynamics, when the Holy Spirit has come [epi] upon you [or over you, or when there is that overflow from you]: and ye shall be witnesses unto me ( Act 1:8 )<br/>And so the dynamic, to be a witness for Jesus Christ. It is interesting that the word witness in Greek is the word martus from where we get our word martyr. And in Greek it does mean martyr. A witness is one who not only proclaims what he believes, he lives what he believes, he is what he believes, and he believes it so strongly, that if necessary, he'll die for what he believes. That's how strong is his belief. He's a martus. You can't stop him. He's not afraid to die for what he believes.<br/>You remember when Paul was on his way back to Jerusalem and Agabus came down from Caesarea and he took Paul's girdle and tied himself up and he said, "So is the man who owns this girdle to be bound when he gets to Jerusalem." And Paul's friends began to weep, saying, "Oh, Paul, don't go, don't go." And he said, "What do you mean by these tears? Do you think you're going to dissuade me? Do you think I'm worried about being bound? I'm ready to die." He was a martus. "I'm ready to die." Being put to death for your faith did not make you a martyr; because you were a martyr, you were put to death. Because you were a witness, because you believed it so strong. So, it did not make you a witness, it only proved what you were. You were a witness all along. If you hadn't been a martus, you would've never gone to your death. You would've recanted; you would've said, "Whoa, whoa, wait, wait. Hold on, let's change course here. I think that I may have made a mistake." Then you say, "Well, he wasn't a martus. Stealing a horse doesn't make you a horse thief; it only proves that you were. No one steals a horse unless he's a horse thief. So, stealing it doesn't make you a horse thief, it only proves that you were all along. Being martyred only proves what you were a witness, a martus. "And you will be witnesses." And isn't it interesting that most of them were martyred? "Witnesses unto Me."<br/>The witness was to be both in Jerusalem, and in all of Judea ( Act 1:8 ),<br/>The witness began right at home. The hardest place, isn't it? It's to start right at home in Jerusalem, and then the area around Jerusalem, the area of Judea. And then it was to spread up into Samaria. And then it was to go out into the uttermost parts of the world. And as we study the book of Acts, we will see this very progression. How the witness began in Jerusalem. We'll get that in the next chapter. And then we'll see how it began to spread through out Judea. And then Phillip went up into Samaria, and then finally Paul and Barnabas are called to go into the uttermost parts of the world. And so the witness spread through the anointing and the empowering of the Holy Spirit.<br/>Now when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight ( Act 1:9 ).<br/>This is the final promise made by Jesus to His disciples. This is it, the final words prior to His ascension. Of course, later He came and talked to Paul and others, but prior to His ascension, this is His final word. And upon this, when He had spoken these things, while they were watching Him, He was taken up and a cloud received Him out of their sight.<br/>And while they were looking steadfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, there were two men who stood by them in white apparel ( Act 1:10 );<br/>We assume they were angels.<br/>Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as you have seen him go into heaven ( Act 1:11 ).<br/>They saw Him as He ascended up into heaven and they will behold Him when He comes again. "Behold the Lord cometh with ten thousands of His saints, to execute judgement upon the earth" (Jud 1:14-15). And then, "Unto Him who loved us and gave Himself for us and who has made us unto our God, kings and priests who shall reign with Him upon the earth, behold the Lord cometh, and every eye shall see Him, and they also who pierced Him shall mourn" Rev 1:5-7 ). So the Lord's coming. Every eye shall see Him. The Jehovah Witnesses say that He is already come, but it was a secret coming. As it was only the disciples that saw Him go, it was only the disciples, of the Jehovah Witnesses, who saw Him return. But Jesus said, "If they say unto you, 'He has come in secret and has gone into a secret chamber don't believe it'" ( Mat 24:26 ). So you have to choose, to believe Jesus or them.<br/>"This same Jesus which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as you've seen Him go into heaven."<br/>Now there's a very interesting verse in II John, verse Act 1:7 , "For many deceivers are entered into the world who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh." That, unfortunately, is a poor translation of the Greek. For this participle is in the present tense and should be translated "is coming in the flesh." Those who would deny that Jesus Christ is coming in the flesh. What does John say of them? "They are a deceiver and an antichrist. Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward. For whosoever transgresses and abides not in the doctrine of Christ, has not God. He that abides in the doctrine of Christ, he has both the Father and the Son. And if there come any unto your door (on Saturday morning) and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, and neither bid him good-bye. For he that bids him good-bye is a partaker of his evil deeds" (2Jn 1:7-11). Ask them one question, "Is Jesus coming in the flesh?" Just ask them that question. And if they say no, just remember what John warned you and what John told you. "If any confess not that Jesus Christ is coming in the flesh." Do you remember when He was with the disciples and He said, "Give me something to eat"? He said, "You know, spirits don't eat; touch me. See? It's me." So, this same Jesus is coming again in the same manner in which they saw Him go into heaven. And I, for one, believe that that coming is very soon.<br/>Then retuned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a Sabbath's day journey [about two-thirds of a mile]. And when they were come in, they went up into an upper room, where there abode both Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, and Phillip, and Thomas, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon Zelotes, and Judas the brother of James. And these all continued in one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers ( Act 1:12-14 ).<br/>This is the last mention of Mary the mother of Jesus. At this point and from this point on, there is no further mention of her in the Acts of the Apostles or in the epistles. No mention of her death or of her miraculous ascension into heaven, without death. Nothing is mentioned in the scripture. It is silent.<br/>His brethren would be a reference probably to James and to Jude and to those other brothers who were sons of Joseph and Mary.<br/>The upper room--there are some who say that it is the same upper room in which Jesus had the Last Supper with His disciples. And yet, there are others who hold to this upper room being a room in the temple precincts where the early church met. Take your choice.<br/>And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples, and said, (the number of their names together were about one hundred and twenty,) men and brethren, this Scripture must needs have been fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit by the mouth of David spake before concerning Judas, which was a guide to those who took Jesus ( Act 1:15-16 ).<br/>Here again, Peter still his same impetuous self. They're waiting in prayer and supplication, and Peter stands up and says, "Fellows, there's a scripture that's gotta be fulfilled." And you know he's going to move ahead, "Let's get the program going; let's cast lots and find out who's going to take Judas' place." I do feel that Peter was again in the flesh, manifesting that impetuous nature that was his. And I think that the future history of the church in the book of Acts points this out. I am interested in Peter's understanding of the scriptures, how that he is quoting from so many places in the Old Testament. Peter does manifest a very great understanding of the Old Testament scriptures which is a point in his favor.<br/>Notice that Peter ascribes to the Holy Spirit those things that David wrote. So that, "All scripture is given by inspiration of God" ( 2Ti 3:16 ). Not part of the scriptures. Because, if you tell me that part of the scriptures are given by inspiration of God, then I must ask you, "What parts are by inspiration and what parts are not by inspiration?" And then you are then the authority who tells me what part I can believe and what part I can't believe. And the minute that God is no longer the authority but you're the authority, I'm in trouble. Beware of those who say, "Well, you can't believe all of the scriptures." The scriptures themselves say, "All scripture is given by inspiration of God." And here, Luke in writing of what Peter was saying, declares that David was actually the spokesman for the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit, by the mouth of David, spake concerning Judas.<br/>For he was numbered with us, [he was one of the twelve] he had obtained a part of this ministry. But now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity; and falling headlong ( Act 1:17-18 ),<br/>He purchased the field, the potter's field as Zachariah the eleventh chapter declares.<br/>and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all of his bowels gushed out ( Act 1:18 ).<br/>There are those who find a discrepancy in the scriptures, because in one of the gospels we are told that when Judas came back and tried to return the money, and they said, "Hey, it's your problem. We can't take it." And put it back in the temple treasury. "It's blood money." Then he threw it there on the floor of the temple and he went out and hung himself. Here Peter tells us that he fell headlong and just popped. And there are those who imagine a discrepancy. Very simple, he went up into the tree to hang himself, tied the rope around his neck and tied it to the limb and jumped. And the force of the fall either snapped the rope or his head, and he fell on down into the canyon and just as he said it here.<br/>It was known to all of the dwellers at Jerusalem; insomuch that the field is called in their tongue, Aceldama, that is to say, The field of blood. For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be desolate, and let no man dwell therein: and, His bishoprick let another take ( Act 1:19-20 ).<br/>Now in reality he's quoting from two different Psalms here. From Psa 69:25 ,he puts it together with Psa 109:8 . And putting the two together he finds these prophecies concerning Judas.<br/>Wherefore of these men ( Act 1:21 )<br/>Now here is where they are looking for someone to take Judas' place to be an apostle. Here are the qualifications they looked for in that time.<br/>Wherefore of these men which have companied with us all the time that the Lord Jesus when in and out among us ( Act 1:21 ),<br/>Now you remember there were many disciples, many disciples of which Jesus chose ten to be apostles. And the word apostle means "one who is sent out." Or chose twelve to be apostles, so He sent out the twelve. The number of human government. "We only have eleven. We need one to take Judas' place, but we need one who has been with us all the while from the beginning with Jesus."<br/>From the time he was baptized by John, until the day he was taken up from us, must one be ordained to be a witness [of what?] of His resurrection ( Act 1:22 ).<br/>So these were the requirements they were looking for. Someone who had been around the whole while. From the time of John's baptism to the ascension. And one who saw the risen Lord, and thus could bear fact of the resurrection, their testimony to the fact.<br/>Now Paul the apostle, later in asserting the fact that he was an apostle said, "Have I not seen the risen Christ?" Evidently that was one of the requirements of apostleship. Someone asked me, "Are there apostles today?" Well, I don't know. I don't think that there are in the same sense that they were in the New Testament. Surely there is none today who can bear witness to the resurrection as they did.<br/>They appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias. And they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord, which knowest the hearts of all men, show whether of these two that you have chosen ( Act 1:23-24 ),<br/>I think that we often make this mistake of giving the Lord two choices, both wrong. Limiting God, you see. We're so prone to do this. Obviously, Paul was God's choice. Peter was impetuous, and jumping the gun said, "Hey, we've got to do something, you know, gotta help God out. You know, one's missing and we've got to fill him in." And yet, "God, which one of these two do you want?" And giving God the two choices.<br/>That he may take part of this ministry and this apostleship, from which Judas by the transgression fell, that he might go to his own place. And so they gave forth their lots ( Act 1:25-26 );<br/>An interesting way by which they sought to determine the will of God. Let's throw dice, find out what God's will is here. It's interesting to me, the various ways that people have devised to discern the will of God. Now, in the Old Testament times they had an interesting way of coming to the priest, who would inquire of the Lord for them through the Urim and the Thummim, the "lights and perfections." Just what these Urim and Thummim were, we don't know. I'm sure they were not the colored glasses that Joseph Smith found with the Golden Tablets; the magic glasses, that when you put them on, you could suddenly read the hieroglyphic writing.<br/>There are those who say that the Urim and Thummim were actually a black and a white stone that was worn in a pouch on the chest of the priest. They would pray and ask the Lord a particular question. You remember that David was asking the Lord definite questions: "Lord, shall we go out against the Philistines?" The answer was, "No." So again, the next day, "Lord, shall we go out against the Philistines?" The answer was, "Yes." "When shall we go?" They would ask specific questions, and the Lord would direct them through the Urim and the Thummin. They say that the priest would pray, seek God, and then reach in and pull out one of the two stones. If it was the white stone, it was a yes answer. If it was a no, then it would be the black stone that he would pull out. Some even say we get the term blackballed from this Urim and Thummim. Actually, back in the original it is a no vote against a particular project or idea. Just what the Urim and Thummim were, we don't know. But during the Old Testament period, they did use a method of casting lots to determine the will of God.<br/>So here the disciples are picking up on the same thing as they are throwing the dice to see which of the two fellows that God had chosen to replace Judas Iscariot.<br/>the lot fell on Matthias; he was numbered with the eleven ( Act 1:26 ).<br/>Now who in the world is Matthias? No one ever heard of him before or since. It'll be interesting to meet Matthias and find out who he is and what he did. I think from the subsequent history, it's obvious to assume that God chose Paul as an apostle. Paul declares it himself. Now this is the last time we ever read of them seeking to discern the will of God by the casting of lots or by a chance kind of a thing.<br/>I know a fellow today, in seeking to discern the will of the Lord, will pray and ask the Lord a question. He'll have ten pennies in his pocket, and as he's praying, he'll take the pennies with his eyes closed and put them down on the table, and if they all come up heads, it's a yes. An interesting thing, every once in a while, they'll all come up heads, and that's pretty good odds. Yet, we don't find any pattern for this after the Holy Spirit was given. Once the Holy Spirit came upon the church, then the Holy Spirit began to speak to them and direct them. And the Holy Spirit said, "Separate unto me Paul and Barnabas for the ministry where I have called them" ( Act 13:2 ). And the Holy Spirit sent them forth. So we find the church more directly guided by the Holy Spirit. Once the Holy Spirit came, this throwing dice to find out the will of God was set aside.<br/>"<br/><br/>King James Version<br/><br/>This is the 1769 King James Version of the Holy Bible (also known as the Authorized Version). "Public Domain" | Smits Čaks - Caur Bībeli C2000 SeriesVai mēs vēršamies pie Apustuļu darbu grāmatas, pirmās nodaļas, kad mēs sākam mācīties par agrīno baznīcu.<br/>Lūka, Apustuļu grāmatas autors, apustuļa Pāvila pavadonis, kurš bija arī Evaņģēlija autors Saskaņā ar Lūkas teikto, uzrakstīja šos divus traktātus draugam, Teofilam. Teofils ir grieķu vārds. Tas ir vārds, kam ir skaista nozīme. Vārds nozīmē Dieva mīļāko. Ir daži, kas uzskata, ka tas nebija cilvēks vispār, bet evaņģēlijs un Apustuļu grāmata bija adresēta Dieva mīļotājiem, lai kas jūs būtu. Ir arī citas tradīcijas, kas saka, ka Teofils patiesībā bija Lūkas saimnieks. Tas, ka šajās dienās ārsti bija vergi, parasti turīga patrona vergs. Tā ka Lūkas kungs bija Teofils, un viņš atbrīvoja Lūku būt kopā ar Pāvilu misionāru ceļojumos. Tādējādi Lūka raksta atpakaļ savam bijušajam saimniekam. Tā ir agrīna baznīcas tradīcija, bet to, protams, nav iespējams pierādīt, tāpat kā daudzas citas tradīcijas.<br/>Bet ir arī tādi, kas tic, ka Pāvils, atnācis Troadā, redzēja parādību: lūk, viņš piesauca cilvēku, sacīdams: Nāc uz Maķedoniju un palīdzi mums! Pirmais, ko Pāvils satika, kad ieradās Maķedonijā, bija Lūka, un, tā kā mēs atrodamies Apustuļu darbu grāmatā, jūs redzēsiet, ka tad, kad mēs nonākam pie šīs Apustuļu darbu grāmatas daļas, Lūka sāk vairāk rakstīt pirmajā, nevis trešajā personā. Tātad, tas ir, acīmredzot, šajā konkrētajā punktā Apustuļu darbos Lūks kļuva par Pāvila pavadoni un sāka ceļot kopā ar viņu. Viņš sāka izmantot vietniekvārdus "mēs" un "mums", nevis "viņi" un "viņi". Tas ir, bez šaubām, kur Lūka kļuva par dalībnieku un aculiecinieks par tām lietām, kas notika no šī brīža. Mēs sniegs šo, lai jums, kad mēs uz šo jautājumu.<br/>Viņš sāk Apustuļu darbi, sasaistot to ar Evaņģēliju Saskaņā ar Lūkas. Tas ir interesanti, ka pēdējā lieta, ka Lūkas ieraksti viņa evaņģēlijā ir pati pirmā lieta, ko viņš ieraksti Apustuļu darbi. Mēs atrast Lūkas evaņģēlijs noslēguma kā Jēzus stāsta Saviem mācekļiem gaidīt Jeruzalemē, kamēr tie tiks endued ar spēku no augšas. Un tad Jēzus uzkāpa debesīs, un tāpēc viņš aizver evaņģēliju. Atverot Apustuļu darbi, viņš raksta,<br/>Pirmais traktāts [tas ir, saskaņā ar Lūkas evaņģēliju,] Es rakstu jums, Teofil, par visu, ko Jēzus sāka darīt un mācīt (Act 1:1),<br/>Atslēgas vārds ir sākusies. Evaņģēlijs Saskaņā ar Lūkas nav pilns stāsts par ministrijas Jēzus Kristus. Tas ir tikai sākums ministrijas Jēzus Kristus. Jēzus turpina kalpot cilvēku vajadzībām. Jēzus turpina dziedēt slimiem. Jēzus turpina celt augšā mirušos. Jēzus turpina sludināt pasaulei Savu mīlestību un Savu evaņģēliju, tikai tagad Viņš kalpo caur tiem mācekļiem, kuri ir svaidīti ar savu Svēto Garu. Bet Kristus kalpošana turpinās; būtībā ir premisa, ka Lūka ņem Apustuļu darbos. Pirmais traktāts par visu, ko Jēzus sāka, gan darīt, gan mācīt.<br/>Tagad tāpēc Apustuļu darbi ir nepabeigta grāmata, jo Tas Kungs šodien turpina strādāt caur to cilvēku dzīvēm, kuri ir veltījuši sevi par Dieva instrumentiem. Lai tiktu vadīts un vadīts, un svaidīts ar Viņa Svēto Garu, turpināt Jēzus kalpošanu pasaulē šodien. Tagad Dievs ir noteicis, ka Viņa darbs ir jāveic caur cilvēku instrumentiem. Es nesaku, ka tas ir jāpaveic. Dievs var izmantot eņģeļu būtnes Savam darbam, un pienāks laiks Atklāsmes grāmatas laikā, kad Dievs izmantos eņģeļus, lai sludinātu Savu evaņģēliju cilvēkiem visā pasaulē. Atklāsme, 14.nodaļa, "Pirmais eņģelis, kas lido caur debesu vidū, kam ir mūžīgs evaņģēlijs" (Atkl.14:6). Bet šobrīd Dievs ir izvēlējies izmantot cilvēku instrumentus. Kā nepilnīgi, kā tie var būt, tomēr tas ir tas, ko Dievs ir nolēmis izmantot. Aizraujoša lieta par to, ka ir, Dievs izmantos mani, un Dievs izmantos tevi. Tik daudzas reizes, mēs esam ubagošanā off, "Ak, Kungs, es nevaru runāt. Es nekad neesmu varējis runāt pirms vai pat tagad, Kungs. " Kā Mozus mēģināja ubagot pie aicinājumu Dieva. Jeremija teica: "Kungs, es esmu tikai bērns; neviens gatavojas klausīties mani. "Un mums visiem ir mūsu attaisnojumus, kāpēc mēs nevaram izmantot. Vai ne mēs? Mēs visi zinām iemeslus, kāpēc Dievs nevarēja izmantot mūs.<br/>Reiz, kad Kungs aicināja pravieti, lai tas darītu savu darbu, Viņš sacīja: Kungs, sūti, ko vien vēlies! Kungs sacīja: Hei, es tevi saucu. " Kungs, laba ideja; sūti, ko vēlies. Tik bieži mēs esam tādā stāvoklī, "Kungs, sūtīt ar rokām, kam jūs vēlaties, ikviens, izņemot mani Kungs." Un tomēr, Dievs ir nolicis izmantot mūs.<br/>Tagad katrs no mums var parādīt savas nepilnības. Katrs no mums var norādīt uz saviem trūkumiem, un mēs visi varam atrast attaisnojumu, kāpēc Dievs negribētu mani izmantot. Bet tomēr, Dievs ir izvēlējies izmantot tevi. Lai caur savu dzīvi Viņš varētu atklāt sevi trūcīgai pasaulei. Jūs domājat, kad Dievs ir šādi instrumenti, lai izmantotu, kā viņš kādreiz got darbu izdarīt, vai ne?<br/>Līdz tai dienai, kurā viņš tika uzņemts, pēc tam, kad Viņš caur Svēto Garu bija devis norādījumus apustuļiem, kurus Viņš bija izredzējis (Act 1:2):<br/>Tieši ar to viņš noslēdza Lūkas evaņģēliju. Diena, kad Jēzus tika uzņemts, pēc tam, kad Viņš apustuļiem bija licis gaidīt spēka devumu.<br/>Tiem Viņš arī (tas ir, apustuļiem) pēc savām ciešanām un nāves daudzos pierādījumos apliecināja, ka Viņš ir dzīvs (Jņ.ev.1:3).<br/>Ir grūti noliegt Jēzus Kristus augšāmcelšanās faktu. Es biju uzjautrināts, kā arī satraukts un kairināts ar rakstu, ko pagājušajā sestdienā lasīju Santa Ana reģistrā. No radīšanas zinātnes un evolūcijas teorijām, kas tiek prezentētas apriņķa skolās. Kā tas, ka šis profesors teica, ka viņš māca zinātnes klasi, un tādējādi viņi nodarbojas tikai ar faktiem, un ka viņiem nav vietas teorijām. Jo zinātne ir balstīta uz faktu un radīšana ir balstīta uz reliģisko māņticību. Tas aizņem daudz ticības ticēt reliģiskās teorijas. Kad jums ir darīšana ar faktiem, jūs varat vienkārši pieņemt tos. Es nodomāju: "Ļoti interesanti šajā dabaszinātņu stundā, viņi man iemācīja, ka pasaule ir četrus miljardus gadu veca. Nu viņi māca, ka pasaule ir divpadsmit miljardus gadu veca. Un tas nebija tik sen, ka es devos uz skolu. "<br/>Interesanti, ka Bībele nekad nav bijusi jāpārskata vai jāatjaunina, lai atbilstu pašreizējiem datiem, ko cilvēki ir atklājuši. Un tomēr, ja jūs šodien paņemtu manas vidusskolas mācību grāmatas un mēģinātu no tām mācīt kādu zinātnes klasi, jūs konstatētu, ka daudzas no lietām, kas vidusskolā tika mācītas kā zinātnisks fakts, vairs netiek atzītas par zinātniskiem faktiem. Vienkāršā šūnu protoplazma vairs nav vienkārša šūna, bet ļoti sarežģīta. Ja ir kāds fakts, ko vēsturē var apliecināt, tas ir fakts par Jēzus Kristus augšāmcelšanos no mirušajiem.<br/>Mums ir tiesu prakses sistēma, kas balstās uz liecinieku liecībām. Ja kāds tiek apsūdzēts kādā noziegumā un ir cilvēki, kas ir liecinieki šim noziegumam tā pastrādāšanas laikā, un viņi tiek novesti līdz līmenim, un viņi zvēr pateikt patiesību, visu patiesību un neko citu kā tikai patiesību, lai palīdzētu viņiem Dievam. Un viņu nopratināšanā viņi apgalvo, ka: "Es redzēju, ka cilvēks bankā maijā divdesmit trešajā. Es redzēju viņu izraut ieroci no viņa mētelis. Es dzirdēju viņu prasību, lai visa nauda tiktu dota viņam. Es redzēju viņu, kā viņš atstāja banku. Es redzēju viņu kā virsnieks notverti viņu ārā. "Un, ja jūs varat saņemt trīs vai četri liecinieki norādīt uz šo cilvēku, un saglabās savu liecību, kas tiek izskatīta, ka cilvēks ir atzīts par vainīgu. Viņš ir tas, kurš to darīja. Mums ir divi vai trīs liecinieki, kas liecina par to pašu stāstu par šo cilvēku, un tiek pieņemts, ka viņš ir tas, kurš izdarīja noziegumu un ir vainīgs. Jums ir liecinieki, kuri ir zvērējuši pateikt patiesību, kas pārbauda.<br/>Pēc Jēzus nāves, kad Viņš atkal augšāmcēlās, Viņš parādījās daudziem dažādiem cilvēkiem, kas deva zvērestu liecināt, ka viņi Viņu redzēja. Ka viņi runāja ar Viņu, ka Viņš viņiem parādījās dažādās vietās dažādos apstākļos. Un uz laiku četrdesmit dienas bija apmeklējot ar viņiem. Un vienā reizē, ne vairāk kā pieci simti cilvēku, kas bija sapulcējušies vienā vietā, Viņš parādījās. Tas ir grūti vienkārši atmet vai noliegt liecību par šiem cilvēkiem. To darīt nozīmē diskreditēt visu mūsu tiesu prakses sistēmu. Bet ne tikai tas, ka šie vīrieši, kas liecināja, ka viņi redzēja augšāmcelto Kungu, ka viņi runāja ar Viņu, ka viņi ēda ar Viņu, viņi visi, izņemot vienu, tikās vardarbīgu nāvi no citu cilvēku rokām, jo viņi apstiprināja, ka stāsts, ko viņi teica, bija taisnība. Jūs runājat par lieciniekiem, kas zvērējuši pateikt patiesību, visu patiesību, tikai patiesību. Ja kāda cilvēka dzīvība tika apdraudēta šī liecinieka dēļ, un tas bija meli, vismaz viens no viņiem būtu salauzts zem spiediena. Viņi būtu atzinušies visā mānīšanās. "Viņš parādīja sevi dzīvs pēc Viņa kaislību ar daudziem nekļūdīgiem pierādījumiem."<br/>Un četrdesmit dienas viņi turējās pie tā, kas attiecas uz Dieva valstību (Lk.1:3).<br/>Dažreiz mēs vainojam mācekļus, jo viņiem ir jautājumi par Dieva valstības laiku. Ļaujiet atcerēties, ka Dieva valstība bija iecienītākais Jēzus Kristus priekšmets. Viņš vienmēr runāja par Dieva valstību, un tā ir liela cerība, ka Viņš stāda sirdī visiem cilvēkiem. Lietas ne vienmēr turpinās sabojāt, jo tie ir. Pasaule neiet mūžīgi tumsas varā, ļaunuma važās. Kādu dienu Dievs nodibinās Savu valstību virs zemes. Taisnīga prieka un miera valstība. "Jēzus valdīs, kur ere saule doth viņas secīgus braucienus palaist. Un Viņa valstība stiepsies no krasta uz krastu. " Un šī diena būs visbrīnišķīgākā diena, kādu pasaule jebkad ir pieredzējusi, jo Viņa valstībā tiks atceltas slimības, ciešanas un sāpes. Kā grēks un alkatība, un šīs lietas, kas ir padarījušas pasauli tik nepanesamu vietu, tiks atceltas Viņa valstībā. Bezdievīgais komerciālisms, cilvēka ekspluatācija, visas šīs lietas tika atceltas Viņa diženajā valstībā, kad Viņš valda. Nav brīnums, ka mācekļi vēlējās to iegūt. Es ļoti vēlos to iegūt; es esmu noraizējies par Viņa valstību. Un Jēzus mums teica, kad mēs lūdzam, pirmais lūgums ir: "Tava valstība nāk. Tavs prāts notiks uz zemes, kā tas ir debesīs" (Mt 6:10 ). Tas ir pareizais vēlmes veids, kas mums visiem ir. Es vēlos Dieva valstību. Un tā Viņš runāja uz tiem šīs valstības četrdesmit dienu laikā.<br/>Un Viņš, kopā ar tiem sapulcinājies, pavēlēja viņiem neaiziet no Jeruzalemes, bet gaidīt Tēva apsolījumu, ko jūs (tā Viņš sacīja) no Manis esat dzirdējuši (Lk.1:4).<br/>Bet viņš sacīja: “Redzi, tagad pagaidiet šeit, Jeruzālemē, līdz jūs saņemsiet Tēva apsolījumu.” Šis solījums, uz kuru Viņš atsaucas, neapšaubāmi ir solījums Joēlā, kur Tas Kungs apsolīja: "Un tas notiks vēlāk, saka Tas Kungs, ka es izliešu Savu Garu pār visu miesu, un jūsu dēli un meitas pravietos, un jūsu jaunekļi sapņos sapņus, jūsu sirmgalvji redzēs vīzijas, un uz maniem kalpiem un savām kalponēm Es izliešu Savu Garu, saka Tas Kungs" (2:28). Tēva apsolījums: nāks diena, kad Dievs izlies Savu Garu pār visu miesu, visiem ticīgajiem. Viņi, katrs, saņems šo dinamiku no Dieva.<br/>Jo Jānis [Viņš teica,] patiesi kristīts ar ūdeni; bet jūs pēc nedaudz dienām tiksiet kristīti Svētajā Garā (As.1:5).<br/>Kristīšanās ideja bija tāda, ka emersion, bapteedzo. Jānis kristīja ar ūdeni, iegremdēja cilvēkus ūdenī, "jūs drīz iegremdēs Svētajā Garā."<br/>Bet kad tie sapulcējās, tie jautāja Viņam, sacīdami: Kungs, vai Tu šinī laikā atkal uzcelsi Izraēļa valsti?<br/>"Kad tas būs, Kungs? Kad ir laiks, lai šo atjaunošanu?" Un Jēzus runā ar viņiem tagad, nevis par valstību, bet par spēku, ka viņi gatavojas saņemt pakalpojumu. Un tā Viņš sukas malā savu jautājumu.<br/>Sacīdams viņiem: Nav jūsu vidū zināt laikus vai brīžus, ko Tēvs nolicis savā spēkā (Lk.1:7).<br/>"Tas nav, lai jūs zinātu." Viņi pastāvīgi dzīvoja, gaidot tūlītēju valstības izveidošanu. Visā Jēzus dzīves laikā viņi gaidīja, ka Viņš jebkurā brīdī ieies tālruņa kabīnē un iznāks kā pasaules glābējs. Shazzam! Parādot savu spēku un gāžot valdības pasaulē, izveidojot Dieva valstību uz zemes. Un viņi gaidīja katru dienu šīs pārmaiņas, lai pārtvert. Un vienmēr, kad Jēzus runāja par došanos uz Jeruzalemi, pārgājis grēcīga cilvēka rokās, krustā sists, Viņš sacīja: Nē, Kungs! Nē, jūs valstības jūs nesaprotat, Kungs! Kad Jēzus nomira pie krusta, viņi visi bija ļoti vīlušies.<br/>Divi mācekļi ceļā uz Emmaus, tik skumji. "Hei, puiši. Kā nāk tu esi tik skumji, kā jūsu staigājot gar?" "Ko tu domā? Jums ir jābūt svešinieks šeit, ja jūs nezināt, kas pēdējā laikā notiek Jeruzalemē." "Kas? "Ak, puisis ar nosaukumu Jēzus no Nācaretes ... ak cilvēks, tas bija varens un spēcīgs. Dieva svaidījums bija pār Viņa dzīvi. Mēs cerējām, ka Viņā bija glābšana Izraēlas, bet tie krustā Viņu. Mēs cerējām . . tagad tas ir miris. " Tagad Viņš ir augšāmcēlies, un Viņš saka: "Pēc dažām dienām, puiši, jūs saņemsiet Tēva apsolījumu." "Ak, kāds solījums? Solījums par valstības nodibināšanu?" Redzi, tas bija likumīgi, ka viņiem vajadzētu jautāt. "Vai tas ir Kungs? Labi! Vai tas ir laiks? Vai jūs gatavojas izveidot savu valstību tagad? " Nē. Tas nav, lai jūs zināt tos laikus, ka Tēvs ir iecelts vai ka Tēvs ir savā spēkā. Bet, jūs saņemsiet spēku, kad Svētais Gars ir nācis pār jums. "<br/>Tagad šeit, grieķu prievārds epi tiek izmantots, lai apzīmētu jaunas attiecības, kas viņiem bija ar Svēto Garu. Evaņģēlijā Saskaņā ar Jāņa, 14. nodaļā, kā Jēzus ir tur sola sūtīt Svēto Garu, Viņš teica: "Es neatstāšu jums nemierīgs. Es nākšu pie jums, un es lūgšu Tēvu, un Viņš sūtīs jums citu iepriecinātāju, Patiesības Garu, ko pasaule nevar saņemt, jo tā redz Viņu nepazīst, bet jūs Viņu pazīstat, jo Viņš dzīvo pie jums, un Viņš būs jūsos.”(Jāņa 14:17-18). Tas pats grieķu prievārds kā mūsējais, tikai viņi to raksta "en", nevis "in". Divkāršas attiecības tur John: Viņš ir ar jums, bet Viņš būs dzīvo jūsos. Bet tagad Jēzus teica, ka jūs saņemsiet spēku, kad Svētais Gars nāk pār jums. Grieķu prievārds epi, kas ir tulkots dažādos tekstos visā Jaunajā Derībā kā "pēc" vai "pār" vai man patīk, "pārplūdes."<br/>Jāņa evaņģēlija septītajā nodaļā: "Beidzošajā svētku dienā, kad Jēzus stāvēja Tempļa kalnā un sauca ļaudīm: Ja kas slāpst, tas lai nāk pie Manis un dzer; un kas dzer no tā ūdens, ko Es dodu, tas no savas visdziļākās radības izkratīs dzīva ūdens straumes." Jānis sacīja: “Šis Gars, kas vēl nebija dots, ko tie, kas uz Viņu tic, dabūs” (Joh 7, 37-39). Ko Viņš runāja par Garu? Tas būtu kā dzīvā ūdens straume, kas plūst ārā. Man patīk: "Kad Gars pārplūst jums," pār jums, vai pār jums, vai pārplūst no jums. Tātad trīskārtējās attiecības: Viņš ir ar jums pirms jūsu atgriešanās, Viņš ir tas, kurš liek jums saprast, ka jūs esat grēcinieks, Viņš ir tas, kurš norāda uz Jēzu Kristu kā atbildi, pārliecina pasauli par grēku, taisnīgo un tiesu. Kad jūs atverat savu dzīvi un sirdi Jēzum Kristum un aicināt Viņu ienākt, Svētais Gars nāk un sāk jūs iemīt. Viņš būs jūsos. Vai jūs nezināt, ka jūs neesat savējie, jūs esat atpirkti par maksu, tāpēc godājiet Dievu savā miesā un garā, kas ir Viņa. Un jūs nezināt, ka jūsu miesa ir Svētā Gara svētnīca, kas jūsos. Nepiedzerieties ar vīnu, kas pārpilnībā; bet piepildieties ar Garu!” (1.Kor.6:19-20; Ef.5:18). Bet, lūk, ir trešā daļa. Tā ir stiprinoša pieredze.<br/>Jūs saņemsiet [dūnām] dinamiku, kad pār jums [vai pār jums nāks Svētais Gars, vai, ja ir tā pārplūde no jums]; un jūs būsiet man liecinieki (Likums 1: 8)<br/>Un tā dinamika, lai būtu liecinieks Jēzum Kristum. Interesanti, ka vārds liecinieks grieķu valodā ir vārds martus, no kurienes mēs saņemam savu vārdu moceklis. Un grieķu valodā tas nozīmē mocekli. Liecinieks ir tas, kurš ne tikai sludina to, kam viņš tic, bet dzīvo to, kam viņš tic, viņš ir tas, kam viņš tic, un viņš tic tik stipri, ka, ja nepieciešams, viņš mirs par to, kam viņš tic. Tas ir, cik stipra ir viņa ticība. Viņš ir martus. Viņš nebaidās mirt par to, kam tic.<br/>Jūs atceraties, kad Pāvils devās atpakaļ uz Jeruzalemi un no Cēzarejas atnāca Agabs, un viņš paņēma Pāvila jostu un piesēja sevi, un teica: "Tāds ir tas vīrs, kam pieder šī josta, lai tiktu saistīts, kad viņš nokļūst Jeruzālemē." Un Pāvila draugi sāka raudāt, sakot: "Ak, Paul, neej, neej." Un viņš teica: "Ko tu domā ar šīm asarām? Vai tu domā, ka mani atturēsi? Vai tu domā, ka es esmu noraizējies par to, ka esi saistīts? Es esmu gatavs mirt." Viņš bija martuss. "Es esmu gatavs mirt." Sodīšana par jūsu ticību nepadarīja jūs par mocekli, jo jūs bijāt moceklis, jūs tika nogalināti. Tāpēc, ka jūs bijāt liecinieks, jo jūs ticējāt, ka tas ir tik spēcīgs. Tātad, tas nepadarīja jūs par liecinieku, tas tikai pierādīja, kas jūs bijāt. Jūs visu laiku bijāt liecinieks. Ja jūs nebūtu bijis martuss, jūs nekad nebūtu devies uz savu nāvi. Jūs būtu atteicies; jūs būtu teikuši: "Oho, oho, pagaidiet, pagaidiet. Turies, mainīsim kursu. Es domāju, ka esmu kļūdījies. Tad tu saki: "Nu, viņš nebija martuss. Zirga zaglošana nepadara tevi par zirgu zagli; tas tikai pierāda, ka tu biji. Neviens nezog zirgu, ja vien viņš nav zirga zaglis. Tātad, zagšana tas nav jums zirgu zaglis, tas tikai pierāda, ka jums bija visu laiku. Būt nogalināti tikai pierāda to, ko jūs bijāt liecinieks, martus. "Un jums būs liecinieki." Un tas nav interesanti, ka lielākā daļa no viņiem tika nogalināti? " Liecinieki pie manis."<br/>Tam bija jānotiek gan Jeruzālemē, gan visā Jūdejā (As.1:8).<br/>Liecība sākās tieši mājās. Vissmagākā vieta, vai ne? Tas ir sākt tieši mājās Jeruzālemē, un tad platība ap Jeruzalemi, platība Jūdejas. Un tad tas bija izplatīties uz Samariju. Un tad tas bija, lai iet uz galējās pasaules daļās. Un, kad mēs studē Apustuļu darbu grāmatu, mēs redzēsim šo pašu progresu. Kā liecinieks sākās Jeruzālemē. Mēs saņemsiet, ka nākamajā nodaļā. Tad mēs redzēsim, kā tas iesākās Jūdejā; un tad Filips uzkāpa Samarijā; un tad Pāvils un Barnaba tiek aicināti visā pasaulē. Un tā liecība izplatījās caur svaidīšanu un Svētā Gara spēku.<br/>Bet, to sacījis, kamēr tie redzēja, Viņš tika pacelts; un padebess uzņēma Viņu no viņu acīm (Act 1:9).<br/>Tas ir pēdējais solījums, ko Jēzus saviem mācekļiem. Tas ir tas, pēdējie vārdi pirms Viņa augšāmcelšanās. Protams, vēlāk Viņš nāca un runāja ar Pāvilu un citiem, bet pirms Viņa augšāmcelšanās, tas ir Viņa pēdējais vārds. Un pēc tam, kad Viņš to bija runājis, tie Viņu redzēja, Viņš tika pacelts un mākonis Viņu saņēma no viņu acīm.<br/>Un kad tie, Viņam ejot, skatījās uz debesīm, lūk, tur bija divi vīri, kas stāvēja tiem baltās drēbēs (Act 1:10).<br/>Mēs pieņemam, ka viņi ir eņģeļi.<br/>Bet viņi sacīja: Galilejas vīri, ko jūs stāvat, skatīdamies debesīs? Šis Jēzus, kas no jums ņemts debesīs, tāpat atnāks, kā jūs redzējāt Viņu debesīs nonākam. (1.Moz.1:11).<br/>Viņi redzēja Viņu, kad Viņš uzkāpa debesīs, un tie redzēs Viņu, kad Viņš atkal nāks. "Redzi, Tas Kungs nāk ar desmit tūkstošiem Savu svēto, lai izpildītu spriedumu pār zemi" (Jud 1:14-15). Un tad, "Viņam, kas mūs mīlējis un atdevis sevi par mums, un kas mūs radījis mūsu Dievam, ķēniņiem un priesteriem, kas valdīs kopā ar Viņu uz zemes, lūk, Tas Kungs nāks, un katra acs redzēs Viņu, un tie, kas Viņu caurdūra, arī sēros" Atkl.1:5-7). Tā Kunga atnākšana. Katra acs Viņu redzēs. Jehovas liecinieki saka, ka Viņš jau ir pienācis, bet tas bija noslēpums. Tā kā tikai mācekļi, kas Viņu redzēja, bija tikai Jehovas liecinieku mācekļi, kas redzēja Viņu atgriežamies. Bet Jēzus teica: "Ja viņi jums saka:" Viņš ir nācis slepenībā un ir devies slepenā telpā neticu to "(Mt 24:26). Tātad jums ir jāizvēlas, ticēt Jēzum vai viņiem.<br/>Šis Jēzus, kas no jums paņemts debesīs, tāpat atnāks, kā jūs Viņu redzējāt debesīs aizejam.<br/>Tagad tur ir ļoti interesants dzejolis II Jāņa, dzejolis Akts 1:7 , "Jo daudzi maldinātāji ir iegājuši pasaulē, kas neatzīst, ka Jēzus Kristus ir atnācis miesā." Tas, diemžēl, ir slikts tulkojums no grieķu. Jo šis divdabis ir tagadnes laikā un būtu jātulko "nāk miesā." Tie, kas noliedz, ka Jēzus Kristus nāk miesā. Ko Jānis saka par viņiem? "Viņi ir krāpnieks un antikrists. Pielūkojiet paši sevi, lai mēs nepazaudētu to, ko esam darījuši, bet saņemtu pilnu algu; jo, kas pārkāpj un nepaliek Kristus mācībā, tam nav Dieva. Kas paliek Kristus mācībā, tam ir gan Tēvs, gan Dēls; un, ja kāds nāk pie jūsu durvīm (sestdienas rītā) un nenes šo mācību, tad neuzņemiet viņu savā namā un neaiciniet viņu atvadīties. Jo tas, kas piedāvā viņam ardievas, ir līdzdalībnieks viņa ļaunajiem darbiem "(2Jn 1:7-11). Uzdot viņiem vienu jautājumu, "Vai Jēzus nāk miesā?" Vienkārši uzdot viņiem šo jautājumu. Un, ja viņi saka nē, tikai atcerieties, ko Jānis brīdināja jūs un ko Jānis jums teica. "Ja kāds atzīstas, ka Jēzus Kristus nāk miesā." Vai jūs atceraties, kad Viņš bija kopā ar mācekļiem, un Viņš sacīja: "Dod man kaut ko ēst"? Viņš teica: "Jūs zināt, gari neēd; pieskarties man. Redzi? Tas ir man." Tātad, tas pats Jēzus nāk atkal tādā pašā veidā, kādā viņi redzēja Viņu iet debesīs. Un es, par vienu, uzskatu, ka tas nāk ļoti drīz.<br/>Tad viņi atgriezās atpakaļ Jeruzalemē no kalna, ko sauc par Olīvkalnu, kas ir no Jeruzalemes, sabata gājiena attālumā. Un kad viņi bija atnākuši, tie uzkāpa augšistabā; tur uzturējās Pēteris un Jēkabs, un Jānis, un Andrejs, un Filips, un Toms, un Bērtulis, un Matejs, Jēkabs, Alfeja dēls, un Sīmanis Zerotess, un Jūda, Jēkaba brālis. Un tie visi vienā vienprātībā turpinājās lūgšanā un lūgšanā kopā ar sievietēm un Mariju, Jēzus Māti, un ar Viņa brāļiem (Act 1:12-14).<br/>Šis ir pēdējais Jēzus mātes Marijas pieminējums. Šajā brīdī un no šī brīža par viņu vairs nav pieminēts apustuļu aktos vai vēstulēs. Nav pieminēta viņas nāve vai viņas brīnumainā augšāmcelšanās debesīs bez nāves. Nekas nav minēts Rakstos. Tas ir kluss.<br/>Viņa brāļi, iespējams, runāja par Jēkabu un Jūdeju, kā arī par citiem brāļiem, kas bija Jāzepa un Marijas dēli.<br/>Augšējā istaba - ir daži, kas saka, ka tā ir tā pati augšējā istaba, kurā Jēzus bija Pēdējais vakarēdiens ar saviem mācekļiem. Un tomēr, ir citi, kas tur, lai šī augšējā istaba ir telpa tempļa iecirkņos, kur agrīnā baznīca tikās. Izdari izvēli.<br/>Un tanīs dienās Pēteris piecēlās mācekļu vidū un sacīja: (viņu vārdu skaits kopā bija aptuveni simts divdesmit), vīri un brāļi, šie Raksti noteikti ir piepildīti, ko Svētais Gars ar Dāvida muti runāja pirms par Jūdu, kas bija ceļvedis tiem, kas ņēma Jēzu (Act 1:15-16 ).<br/>Arī šeit, Pēteris joprojām viņa pats trauksmains sevi. Viņi gaida lūgšanās un lūgšanās, un Pēteris pieceļas un saka: "Dvēseles, tur ir raksti, kas ir gotta jāizpilda. " Un jūs zināt, ka viņš virzīsies uz priekšu: "Laidīsim programmu, metīsim kauliņus un noskaidrosim, kas ieņems Jūdas vietu." Man šķiet, ka Pēteris atkal bija miesā, izpaužot to impulsīvo dabu, kas bija viņa. Un es domāju, ka Baznīcas nākotnes vēsture Apustuļu darbu grāmatā to norāda. Mani interesē Pētera izpratne par Svētajiem Rakstiem, kā viņš citē no tik daudzām vietām Vecajā Derībā. Pēteris parāda ļoti lielu izpratni par Vecās Derības Svētajiem Rakstiem, kas ir punkts viņa labā.<br/>Ievērojiet, ka Pēteris piedēvē Svētajam Garam tās lietas, ko Dāvids rakstīja. Tā, ka, "Visi Raksti ir dota ar Dieva iedvesmu" (2Ti 3:16 ). Nav daļa no Svētajiem Rakstiem. Jo, ja jūs man sakāt, ka daļa no Svētajiem Rakstiem ir Dieva iedvesma, tad man jums jājautā: "Kas ir no iedvesmas un kas nav no iedvesmas?" Un tad tu esi autoritāte, kas man saka, kam es varu ticēt un kam nevaru ticēt, un tajā brīdī, kad Dievs vairs nav autoritāte, bet tu esi autoritāte, man ir nepatikšanas. Uzmanieties no tiem, kas saka: Neticiet visiem Rakstiem! Paši Raksti saka: Visi Raksti ir Dieva iedvesti. Un šeit, Lūkas rakstiski par to, ko Pēteris teica, paziņo, ka Dāvids bija faktiski runasvīrs par Svēto Garu. Svētais Gars, ar Dāvida muti, runāja par Jūdas.<br/>Jo viņš bija pieskaitīts mums, viņš bija viens no tiem divpadsmit, viņš bija ieguvis daļu no šīs kalpošanas. Bet tagad šis cilvēks iegādājās lauku par atlīdzību netaisnību; un krīt pārsteidzīgi ("Likums 1:17-18"),<br/>Viņš nopirka tīrumu, podnieka lauku, kā saka Zaharijs vienpadsmitajā nodaļā.<br/>un krīt pārsteidzīgi, viņš pārsprāgt asunder vidū, un visi viņa zarnas iztecēja (Act 1:18) .<br/>Ir tādi, kas atrod pretrunas Svētajos Rakstos, jo vienā no evaņģēlijiem mums ir teikts, ka Jūda, atgriezies, mēģināja atdot naudu, un viņi teica: "Klau, tā ir tava problēma. Mēs to nevaram pieņemt." Un iemetām atpakaļ tempļa dārgumu krātuvē. "Tā ir asins nauda." Tad viņš to iemeta tempļa grīdā, un viņš izgāja un karājās. Šeit Pēteris stāsta, ka viņš nokrita un vienkārši popped. Un ir tie, kas iedomājas neatbilstību. Ļoti vienkārši, viņš iegāja kokā, lai pakārtu sevi, piesietu virvi ap kaklu un piesietu to pie ekstremitātes un izlēktu. Un kritiena spēks vai nu salauza virvi vai galvu, un viņš nokrita kanjonā, un tāpat kā viņš to teica šeit.<br/>Tas kļuva zināms visiem Jeruzalemes iedzīvotājiem, tā ka tīrums viņu valodā tika nosaukts Hakeldama, tas ir, asins tīrums. Jo psalmu grāmatā ir rakstīts: Viņa mājoklis lai paliek tukšs un neviens lai tur nedzīvo, un Viņa laidnis lai ņem citu (Act 1:19-20).<br/>Tagad patiesībā viņš citē no diviem dažādiem psalmiem šeit. No Psa 69:25 ,Viņš liek to kopā ar Psa 109:8. Un liekot abus kopā viņš atrod šos pravietojumus par Jūdas.<br/>Tāpēc no šiem vīriešiem ( Akts 1: 21 )<br/>Lūk, kur viņi meklē kādu, kas Jūdas vietā būtu apustulis. Lūk, kādas kvalifikācijas viņi tolaik meklēja.<br/>Tāpēc vienam no tiem vīriem, kas ar mums kopā dzīvojuši visu laiku, ka Kungs Jēzus ienācis un izgājis starp mums (Lk.1:21).<br/>Tagad jūs atceraties, ka bija daudz mācekļu, no kuriem daudzi mācekļi Jēzus izvēlējās desmit būt par apustuļiem. Un vārds apustulis nozīmē "tas, kurš ir nosūtīts." Vai izvēlējās divpadsmit būt par apustuļiem, tāpēc Viņš izsūtīja divpadsmit. Cilvēku valdības skaits. "Mums ir tikai vienpadsmit. Mums vajag vienu, lai ņemtu Jūdas vietu, bet mums vajag vienu, kas ir bijis ar mums visu laiku no sākuma ar Jēzu."<br/>No tā laika, kad Jānis viņu kristīja, līdz tai dienai, kad viņš tika uzņemts no mums, vai cilvēkam ir jākļūst par Viņa augšāmcelšanās liecinieku? (Apustuļu darbi 1:22).<br/>Tātad šie bija prasības viņi meklē. Kāds, kas bija apmēram visu laiku. No brīža, kad Jāņa kristību uz augšāmcelšanos. Un tas, kurš redzēja augšāmcēlies Kungs, un tādējādi varētu segt faktu augšāmcelšanās, viņu liecību par to.<br/>Bet apustulis Pāvils vēlāk, sacīdams, ka viņš ir apustulis, sacīja: Vai es neesmu redzējis augšāmcelto Kristu? Acīmredzot tā bija apustuļa prasība? Kāds man jautāja: Vai šodien ir apustuļi? Nu, es nezinu. Es nedomāju, ka ir tādā pašā nozīmē, ka viņi bija Jaunajā Derībā. Protams, nav neviena šodien, kas var liecināt par augšāmcelšanos, kā viņi to darīja.<br/>Viņi iecēla divus, Joseph sauc Barsabas, kurš sauca Justus, un Matias. Un viņi lūdza, un sacīja: Tu, Kungs, kurš zina sirdis visiem cilvēkiem, parādīt, vai no šiem diviem, ka esat izvēlējies (Akts 1:23-24 ),<br/>Es domāju, ka mēs bieži vien šo kļūdu, dodot Kungam divas izvēles, gan nepareizi. Ierobežojot Dievu, jūs redzat. Mēs esam tik tendētas to darīt. Acīmredzot, Pāvils bija Dieva izvēle. Pīters bija trauksmains, un, lecot pa ieroci, teica: "Hei, mums kaut kas jādara, mums jāpalīdz Dievam. Zini, viens ir pazudis, un mums viņš ir jāaizpilda." Un tomēr: "Dievs, kuru no šiem diviem tu gribi?" Un dodot Dievam divas izvēles.<br/>Lai viņš varētu piedalīties šajā kalpošanā un šajā apustuļu sūtībā, no kuras Jūda ar pārkāpumu krita, lai viņš varētu doties uz savu vietu. Un tāpēc viņi deva savu daļu ( Akts 1: 25-26 );<br/>Interesants veids, kā viņi centās noteikt Dieva gribu. Metīsim kauliņus, uzzināsim, kāda ir Dieva griba. Man tas ir interesanti, dažādi veidi, kā cilvēki ir izstrādājuši, lai saprastu Dieva gribu. Vecajā Derībā viņiem bija interesants veids, kā atnākt pie priestera, kurš varētu jautāt Kungam par viņiem caur Urimu un Tumīmu, "gaismām un pilnībām". Tikai to, ko šie Urim un Tumīms bija, mēs nezinām. Esmu pārliecināts, ka tās nebija krāsainās brilles, ko Džozefs Smits atrada ar Zelta tabletēm; tās bija burvju brilles, ka, tās uzvelkot, pēkšņi varēja izlasīt hieroglifisko rakstību.<br/>Ir tie, kas saka, ka Urims un Tumīms patiesībā bija melns un balts akmens, kas tika valkāts maisiņā uz priestera krūtīm. Viņi lūdza un uzdeva Kungam īpašu jautājumu. Jūs atceraties, ka Dāvids jautāja Tam Kungam: "Kungs, vai mēs iesim pret filistiešiem?" Atbilde bija: "Nē." Tā arī nākamajā dienā: "Kungs, vai mēs iesim pret filistiešiem?" Atbilde bija: "Jā." "Kad mēs iesim?" Viņi uzdot konkrētus jautājumus, un Kungs varētu virzīt tos caur Urim un Thummin. Viņi saka, ka priesteris lūgties, meklēt Dievu, un pēc tam sasniegt un izraut vienu no diviem akmeņiem. Ja tas bija baltais akmens, tas bija jā atbilde. Ja tas būtu nē, tad tas būtu melnais akmens, ko viņš izrautu. Daži pat saka, ka mēs iegūstam terminu blackballed no šī urima un Thummima. Patiesībā, oriģinālā oriģinālā tas nav balsojums pret konkrētu projektu vai ideju. Tikai to, kas bija Urims un Tumīms, mēs nezinām. Bet Vecās Derības periodā viņi izmantoja lotu liešanas metodi, lai noteiktu Dieva gribu.<br/>Tad mācekļi savāc to pašu, ko viņi meta kauliņus, lai redzētu, kuru no diviem brāļiem Dievs bija izredzējis Jūdasa Iskariota vietā.<br/>partija nokrita uz Matthias; viņš bija numurēts ar vienpadsmit ( Akts 1:26 ).<br/>Tagad, kas pasaulē ir Matthias? Neviens nekad nav dzirdējis par viņu pirms vai kopš. Tas būs interesanti, lai apmierinātu Matthias un uzzināt, kas viņš ir un ko viņš darīja. Es domāju, ka no turpmākās vēstures, tas ir acīmredzami pieņemt, ka Dievs izvēlējās Pāvilu kā apustuli. Pāvils paziņo to pats. Tagad šī ir pēdējā reize, kad mēs kādreiz lasīt par tiem, kas vēlas, lai izprastu Dieva gribu ar liešanas partijām vai nejauši veida lieta.<br/>Šodien es pazīstu kādu, kas vēlas izprast Tā Kunga gribu, lūgsies un uzdos jautājumu Tam Kungam. Viņš būs desmit pennies kabatā, un kā viņš lūdzoties, viņš ņems pennies ar aizvērtām acīm un nodot tos uz galda, un, ja viņi visi nāk uz augšu galvas, tas ir jā. Interesanta lieta, ik pa laikam, viņi visi nāk uz augšu galvas, un tas ir diezgan labas izredzes. Tomēr, mēs neatrodam nevienu modeli par to pēc tam, kad tika dota Svētais Gars. Kad Svētais Gars nāca pār baznīcu, tad Svētais Gars sāka runāt uz viņiem un virzīt tos. Un Svētais Gars teica: "Atsevišķi man Pāvilu un Barnabu par kalpošanu, kur es tos esmu aicinājis" (Act 13: 2). Un Svētais Gars nosūtīja tos tālāk. Tātad mēs atrast baznīcu vairāk tieši vada Svētais Gars. Kad Svētais Gars nāca, tas throwing kauliņus, lai uzzinātu Dieva griba tika atcelts.<br/>"<br/><br/>King James versija<br/><br/>Tas ir 1769. gada Bībeles izdevums King James Version of the Holy Bible (zināms arī kā autorizētā versija). |

Yes that is correct, the Urbanears don't have a built in noise cancelling mic on the headphone itself but from what I can see there is a mic on the cable provided.<br/>1. Well the mic is usually placed where it can have a connection to the PCB which are within the headphones so if you mean that the mic shouldn't be on the headphone itself, that (from my experience) is incorrect.<br/>2.

In fact, dynamic drivers work exactly the same as dynamic microphones but in reverse. Inside a dynamic driver there is a magnet, and when you plug in the headphones, you are sending a AC current through it which will turn the voice coil into a magnet. Depending on the direction of the current, the polarity of the magnet will change. Now since we know for a magnet, same charges repels and different charges attract, we know that the voice coil will move back and forth depending on it's polarity at the time. The voice coil is attached to the diaphragm which will then move back and forth creating a sound wave. The same occurs in reverse, if you move a coil through a magnet you produce a current instead. Since your voice is pushing the diaphragm, it is moving the voice coil back and forth generating the current you have observed.<br/><br/>100+ Head-Fier<br/><br/>Joined:<br/>Nov 7, 2011<br/><br/>Posts:<br/>134<br/><br/>Likes: 55<br/><br/>Exactly.

Tā kā mēs zinām par magnētu, vienādi lādiņi atgrūž un dažādi lādiņi piesaista, mēs zinām, ka balss spole virzīsies uz priekšu un atpakaļ atkarībā no tā polaritātes tajā laikā. Balss spole ir piestiprināta pie diafragmas, kas pēc tam virzīsies uz priekšu un atpakaļ, radot skaņas vilni. Tas pats notiek atpakaļgaitā, ja pārvietojat spoli caur magnētu, tā vietā radot strāvu.

Stalin's opposition within the party, including Bukharin, Yagoda and Rykov were purged in these show trials, as Stalin manipulatively forced them to confess to crimes of planning a coup and opposing the state, even if there was no proof. Gabor T Rittersporn said, "Many of the victims were sincerely devoted to the principles of Bolshevism." This amplifies proof that the Bolshevik ideals that had once been the roots of the Communist Party were being disarranged and destroyed by the Purges. The party was depleted and former members helplessly watched Stalin use the great purge as a tool to transform Russia from a one party state to an unchallenged dictatorship. Again, the purges were shattering the framework of the Communist Party, formed during the Bolshevik revolution. This agrees with the "Stalin the executioner" source as both show the manipulative character, that helped the dictator to enhance his grip on Russia's throat.<br/>The manipulative manner, with which Stalin incriminated his targeted opposition during the purges, in the eyes of everyday Russians, also had an implosive impact on Soviet Society. Stalin was able to collect support from the people through his use of propaganda and the media to help him develop a "cult of personality" and the image of a heroic and brave leader. Through this support Stalin implanted mistrust into the minds of the people, convincing them that traitors of the revolution and what he described as 'enemies of the people', were amongst them.

Staļina opozīcija partijas iekšienē, ieskaitot Bukharinu, Jagodu un Rikovu, tika izlaupīta šajās skates prāvās, jo Staļins manipulatīvi piespieda viņus atzīties noziegumos par valsts apvērsuma plānošanu un pretošanos valstij, pat ja pierādījumu nebija. Gabor T Rittersporn teica: "Daudzi upuri bija patiesi uzticīgi Boļševisma principiem." Tas pastiprina pierādījumu tam, ka boļševiku ideāli, kas kādreiz bija komunistiskās partijas saknes, tika izjaukti un iznīcināti ar Purges. Partija bija noplicināta, un bijušie biedri bezpalīdzīgi noskatījās, kā Staļins izmanto lielo tīrīšanu kā līdzekli, lai pārveidotu Krieviju no vienas partijas valsts uz bezstrīdus diktatūru. Atkal tīrīšanas sagrāva boļševiku revolūcijas laikā izveidotās Komunistiskās partijas struktūru. Tas saskan ar "Staļins bende" avotu, jo abi parāda manipulatīvu raksturu, kas palīdzēja diktatoram uzlabot viņa saķeri ar Krievijas rīkli.<br/>Arī manipulatīvais veids, ar kādu Staļins tīrīšanas laikā inkriminēja savu mērķtiecīgo opozīciju, ikdienas krievu acīs ietekmēja padomju sabiedrību. Staļins spēja savākt tautas atbalstu, izmantojot propagandu un plašsaziņas līdzekļus, lai palīdzētu viņam attīstīt "personības kultu" un varonīga un drosmīga līdera tēlu. Ar šo atbalstu Staļins iedvesa neuzticību tautas prātos, pārliecinot viņus, ka revolūcijas nodevēji un tas, ko viņš raksturoja kā "tautas ienaidniekus", bija viņu vidū.

| Supercell is nerfing brawlers instead of nerfing star powers. I was at 750 last season with power 8 nita and it is very tough to go past that, like, star powers play a really dominant role. The matchmaking is also trash. When i play gem grab(around 600 trophies), there are often matchups where the enemy team has one more player than us who is maxed and it's not even that we have a lvl 9 to compete versus that. Sometimes there are even matchups where the enemy team is fully maxed and none of us are. this is why i dont play brawl stars seriously anymore. It's not even like there arent many players who are not maxed and around 600 trophies. It's annoying.<br/>Edit: I think supercell should have at least a basic mechanism that takes the average of levels of brawlers when setting up matches.<br/><br/>Except trophies don't really indicate your skill. They indicate the skill of the teammates you are placed with. And I'm fine with playing against higher level brawlers, but when one team is all level 10 and the other team isn't, clearly it's unbalanced.<br/><br/>I reccomend getting some good friends to play with, me and 2 friends got my friends power 1 tick to rank 28 by playing gem grab with a certain composition all day and we made it without a single one of us being maxed with our brawlers.<br/><br/>I Know how you feel I used to have brawlers in high trophies with low level and it's to difficult to go more further and everything I was saying to myself "I want to have star powers" really supercell needs to make balance to the star powers or at least make a better matchmaking system.<br/><br/>I kinda feel this. I ain't as good at the game as you, but I got Emz to 500 at power 1 and the matchmaking was horrible. Maxed out players everywhere! And it didn't help that the majority of my teammates had around 5-8k trophies... I had to resort to solo showdown last minute because I can either ambush unsuspecting players or simply play a little aggressive at the right times. But I really wish that it could be a bit easier for people who want to push brawlers to really high trophy ranges without having the luxury of star powers.<br/><br/>Altho spike is still good without curveball. Curveball was just a help for hitting your shots more often as spike. But even before curveball was released, spike was a really strong brawler, so he will remain the same now.<br/><br/>I agree that they should have nerfed ambush, but I think they are trying to balance both Snappy Sniping and Ambush, as they are both getting merged with this change. She was becoming a little powerful, but still not nerf-worthy<br/><br/>I'm not sure about this, but now that Darryl got a noticeable buff, looking at their new stats, it looks like Darryl might overshadow Bull, as not only he can always deal more damage than Bull, he won't die as early anymore, so their survivability will be similar without star power (although Bull's survivability is still noticeably better than Darryl's if he had Tough Guy). Not only that, Darryl's super can auto regenerate, meaning Darryl MIGHT be able to be played effectively both as a heavyweight AND an assassin at the same time (before he sucks as a heavyweight but decent as an assassin)<br/><br/>But hes overrated af. And you get trophies with him really easily. So im kinda ok with the nerf. I havent even played him since when I got him to 500 (around 5 months ago), so not that I care that much either.<br/><br/>Why doesn't Poco/Penny get a HP nerf, if they are Marksman/Healer respectively not a tank?<br/>Why isn't Rosa's tankyness nerfed, cough 70% damage reduction?<br/>Why is Tick allowed to have the highest range and the most free pokedamage in the entire game?<br/>Why doesn't Leon get a HP/Damage buff?<br/><br/>Be that as it may, it was Ambush that was OP, not base Piper. I would argue that Ambush is the best star power in the game (now even more so since the percentage of damage increase indirectly went up) and base Piper was a bottom-10 brawler.<br/><br/>What Supercell should do is revert both nerfs, reduce Ambush to 600, and reduce Snappy Sniping to 0.25 since it'd be indirectly buffed by the base damage buff.<br/><br/>Yea and I believe they went a bit too far with Rosa, because now she is basically the better bull now when it comes to tanking, which she has been for a while. Now, Darryl might as well be a smaller, more powerful bull<br/><br/>Why? I feel she needs a buff in almost everything except her star power. Her health and speed make her super a bit more difficult to use, because she can die pretty easily, and it is really difficult for her to trap faster brawlers like Crow. Her star power is a bit broken though... | Supercell ir nerfing ķildnieki, nevis nerfing zvaigžņu pilnvaras. Man bija 750 pagājušajā sezonā ar jaudu 8 nita, un tas ir ļoti grūts, lai iet garām, ka, piemēram, zvaigžņu pilnvaras spēlē patiešām dominējošu lomu. Matchmaking ir arī trash. Kad es spēlēju gem greifers (ap 600 trofejas), tur bieži matchups kur ienaidnieks komanda ir vēl viens spēlētājs, nekā mums, kas ir maxed, un tas nav pat tas, ka mums ir lvl 9 konkurēt pret to. Dažreiz ir pat matchups, kur ienaidnieka komanda ir pilnībā maxed, un neviens no mums ir. tas ir iemesls, kāpēc es dont spēlēt kautiņš zvaigznes nopietni vairs. Tas nav pat, piemēram, tur aren daudzi spēlētāji, kuri nav maxed un ap 600 trofejas. Tas ir kaitinošas.<br/>Edit: Es domāju, ka superelementam vajadzētu būt vismaz pamata mehānismam, kas ņem vidējos ķildnieku līmeņus, veidojot spēles.<br/><br/>Izņemot trofejas, tās īsti nenorāda uz tavām prasmēm. Tās norāda uz tavu komandas biedru prasmēm. Un ar mani ir labi spēlēties pret augstāka līmeņa ķildniekiem, bet, kad viena komanda ir visā 10. līmenī un otra komanda nav, ir skaidrs, ka tā ir nelīdzsvarota.<br/><br/>Es ieteiktu iegūt dažas labas draugiem spēlēt ar, mani un 2 draugi ieguva manu draugu spēku 1 ērču rangs 28, spēlējot gem greifers ar noteiktu sastāvu visu dienu, un mēs to bez viena no mums ir maxed ar mūsu ķildnieki.<br/><br/>Es zinu, kā jūs domājat, ka man kādreiz bija ķildnieki ar augstām trofejām ar zemu līmeni, un ir grūti iet vēl tālāk, un viss, ko es sev teicu: "Es gribu, lai man būtu zvaigžņu spēks" tiešām ir nepieciešams, lai līdzsvarotu zvaigžņu spēku vai vismaz padarītu labāku saskaņošanas sistēmu.<br/><br/>Es to jūtu. Es neesmu tik labs spēlē kā tu, bet es saņēmu Emz līdz 500 pie varas 1 un matchmaking bija briesmīgs. Maksimāli no spēlētājiem visur! Un tas nepalīdzēja, ka lielākajai daļai manu komandas biedru bija aptuveni 5-8k trofejas ... Man bija ķerties pie solo kāršu atklāšana pēdējā brīdī, jo es var vai nu slēpnis nenojauš spēlētājiem vai vienkārši spēlēt nedaudz agresīvi īstajā laikā. Bet es patiešām vēlos, lai cilvēkiem, kas vēlas spiest ķildniekus uz patiešām augstām trofeju sērijām, būtu mazliet vieglāk, ja viņiem nebūtu zvaigžņu lielību greznības.<br/><br/>Altho smaile joprojām ir labs bez curveball. Curveball bija tikai palīdzēt hitting jūsu šāvienu biežāk kā smaile. Bet pat pirms curveball tika izlaists, smaile bija patiešām spēcīgs ķildnieks, tāpēc viņš paliks tāds pats tagad.<br/><br/>Es piekrītu, ka viņiem vajadzētu būt nervu slazdam, bet es domāju, ka viņi cenšas līdzsvarot gan Snappy Sniping, gan Ambush, jo tie abi tiek apvienoti ar šīm izmaiņām. Viņa kļuva nedaudz spēcīga, bet joprojām nav vērta<br/><br/>Es neesmu pārliecināts par to, bet tagad, ka Darryl ieguva manāms bifeļāda, aplūkojot savu jauno statistiku, izskatās, ka Darryl varētu aizēnot Bull, jo ne tikai viņš vienmēr var tikt galā ar lielāku kaitējumu nekā Bull, viņš nemirs tik agri vairs, tāpēc to izdzīvošanas būs līdzīgs bez zvaigžņu varas (lai gan Bull izdzīvošanas joprojām ir ievērojami labāk nekā Darryl ir, ja viņš bija grūts Guy). Ne tikai to, ka Darryl super var automātiski atjaunoties, kas nozīmē, ka Darryl MIGHT varēs spēlēt efektīvi gan kā smagsvars, gan slepkava vienlaicīgi (pirms viņš sūkā kā smagsvara, bet pienācīgu kā slepkavu)<br/><br/>Bet viņš pārvērtēja af. Un jūs ar viņu ļoti viegli saņemat trofejas. Tātad im kinda ok ar nerf. Es viņu pat neesmu spēlējis, jo, kad es viņu dabūju līdz 500 (apmēram pirms 5 mēnešiem), tā ka man arī tas nerūp.<br/><br/>Kāpēc Poco/Penny nesaņem HP nerf, ja viņi attiecīgi ir Marksman/Healer, nevis tvertne?<br/>Kāpēc Rosa tankyness nefed, klepus 70% bojājumu samazināšanu?<br/>Kāpēc Tick ir atļauts būt augstāko diapazonu un visvairāk bezmaksas pokedamage visā spēlē?<br/>Kāpēc Leons nedabū HP/Damage bifeļāda?<br/><br/>Lai kā arī būtu, tas bija slazds, kas bija OP, nevis bāze Piper. Es apgalvotu, ka slazds ir labākais zvaigžņu spēks spēlē (tagad vēl jo vairāk tāpēc, ka kaitējuma procents netieši palielinājās) un bāze Piper bija grunts-10 ķildnieks.<br/><br/>Ko Supercell vajadzētu darīt, ir atgriezties gan nerfs, samazināt slazds līdz 600, un samazināt sparīgs sniping līdz 0,25, jo tas būtu netieši buffed ar bāzes bojājumu bifeļāda.<br/><br/>Mēs ar Jā un es uzskatām, ka viņi devās mazliet par tālu ar Rosa, jo tagad viņa ir būtībā labāk bullis tagad, kad runa ir par tvertnes, ko viņa ir bijusi, bet. tagad, Darryl varētu būt arī mazāks, jaudīgāku bullis<br/><br/>Kāpēc Es jūtu, ka viņai vajag gandrīz visu, izņemot viņas zvaigžņu spēku. Viņas veselība un ātrums padara viņu par super mazliet grūtāk lietojamu, jo viņa var nomirt diezgan viegli, un viņai ir ļoti grūti slazdot ātrākus brawlers, piemēram, Crow. Viņas zvaigžņu spēks ir mazliet salauzts, lai gan... |

It depends on the income one can earn by producing or buying and selling goods or providing services to others at a price.<br/><br/>In self-employment, the owner alone has to take the profit and bear the risk of loss. So, we find a direct link between the effort and reward in self-employment.<br/><br/>It requires some amount of capital investment, although it may be small.<br/><br/>In self-employment, a person is free to take decisions in respect of running his business profitably and avail of any opportunity that may come up for expansion of his business. It gives complete freedom to work as per one's own will and within the parameters of the prevailing laws.<br/><br/>Thus, self-employment may be defined as, an economic activity which one may perform on his own as a gainful occupation, and this may consist of producing and selling goods, buying and selling goods, or rendering services for a price. | Self-Employment daļa 1<br/><br/>Kad jūs pieņemat darbu jebkurā organizācijā, jums ir jāveic dažādi darbi atbilstoši jūsu darba devēja prasībām, un jūs varat saņemt fiksētu ienākumu summu kā algu. Jūs varat vadīt nelielu mazumtirdzniecības veikalu, šūšanas veikalu, restorānu, maizes un konditorejas izstrādājumus, skaistumkopšanas salonu utt. Jūsu apkārtnē. Jūs varat iesaistīties tirdzniecībā vai ražošanā nelielā mērogā vai sniegt kādu pakalpojumu par cenu. Šādu saimniecisko darbību sauc par pašnodarbinātību.<br/><br/>Pašnodarbinātības nozīme<br/><br/>Mūsu tēvs, māte, brāļi, māsas un citi var būt iesaistīti dažādās saimnieciskās darbībās, caur kurām viņi pelna iztiku. Šīs personas veic saimniecisku darbību, ko sauc par algotu darbu vai algotu darbu, bet ir daudz personu, kas pašas veic nodarbošanos vai kādu uzņēmējdarbību, kuru tās uzsāk un vada patstāvīgi. Viņi iegulda vislielākās pūles un uzņemas visu veidu riskus, lai veiksmīgi turpinātu savu karjeru. Visa viņu darba peļņa nonāk pie viņiem. Mēs visi esam redzējuši mazus pārtikas veikalus, šūšanas veikalus, medicīnas veikalus utt. Mūsu apkārtnē. Tās pieder un pārvalda persona ar vai bez dažu palīgu palīdzības. Viņu saimniecisko darbību sauc par pašnodarbinātību. Tātad, ja indivīds iesaistās jebkurā saimnieciskā darbībā un to pārvalda pats, to sauc par pašnodarbinātību.<br/><br/>Mērķi<br/><br/>Pēc šīs nodarbības jūs varēsiet:<br/><br/>Mērķu raksturojums<br/><br/>Mērķu raksturojums<br/><br/>Pašnodarbinātības raksturojums<br/><br/>Tas ir saistīts ar personas atbildību par darbību un vadību, lai gan tā var izmantot vienas vai divu personu palīdzību, lai palīdzētu šai personai. Tādējādi pašnodarbinātība var nodrošināt darbu arī citām personām.<br/><br/>Ienākumi no pašnodarbinātības nav fiksēti. Tas ir atkarīgs no ienākumiem, ko var nopelnīt, ražojot vai pērkot un pārdodot preces vai sniedzot pakalpojumus citiem par cenu.<br/><br/>Pašnodarbinātībā īpašniekam vien ir jāuzņemas peļņa un jāuzņemas zaudējumu risks. Tātad, mēs atrodam tiešu saikni starp centieniem un atalgojumu pašnodarbinātībā.<br/><br/>Tas prasa zināmu kapitālieguldījumu, lai gan tas var būt neliels.<br/><br/>Pašnodarbinātībā persona var brīvi pieņemt lēmumus par sava uzņēmuma ienesīgumu un izmantot visas iespējas, kas var nākt klajā ar sava uzņēmuma paplašināšanu. Tas dod pilnīgu brīvību strādāt saskaņā ar savu gribu un valdošo likumu robežās.<br/><br/>Tādējādi pašnodarbinātību var definēt kā saimniecisku darbību, ko viens pats var veikt kā algotu darbu, un tā var sastāvēt no preču ražošanas un pārdošanas, preču pirkšanas un pārdošanas vai pakalpojumu sniegšanas par noteiktu cenu. |
