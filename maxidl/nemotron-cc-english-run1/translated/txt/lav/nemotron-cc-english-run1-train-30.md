Undocumented migrants have nothing. They are not allowed to work. They have no right to state benefits nor to a place to live. They are unseen and potentially the most vulnerable group in the UK today.<br/><br/>Undocumented (or irregular) migrants include those trafficked into the sex trade or for domestic servitude; they include visa overstayers; those whose asylum applications have been refused and others who have been subject to failures in the immigration system. All of these may originally have come to the UK legally.<br/><br/>'Illegal immigrants' – those imagined to have entered the country in the backs of lorries – make up a small proportion of the undocumented.<br/><br/>Indeed some sources suggest that half the estimated 120,000 undocumented children in the UK were actually born here to undocumented parents. These children are disadvantaged from birth, solely by their immigration status.<br/><br/>The blog tells the stories of the undocumented. It highlights their daily struggles and vulnerabilities, but also their strength and resilience. It's not an easy read.<br/><br/>You can access the blog via our website (bottom of right hand column on Home Page).<br/><br/>The blog has won the online category of the Speaking Together media awards. The awards were a new addition this year to the Migrant and Refugee Woman of the Year Awards celebration at the Royal Festival Hall in London as part of International Women's Day. The panel of judges – including novelist and playwright Gillian Slovo, and journalist and author, Hannah Pool – was particularly looking for work that challenged myths and stereotypes.<br/><br/>The blog has also won the Blog North Awards 2013 in the Best Writing category and was also shortlisted for an Amnesty International Media Award. | Pēc navigācijas<br/><br/>"Dzīve bez dokumentiem" uzvar Best Writing Award<br/><br/>Lena Granta radītajā emuāra projektā “Dzīve bez dokumentiem” ir iekļauti stāsti par nereģistrētām migrantu ģimenēm un jauniešiem. Nereģistrētiem migrantiem nav nekā. Viņiem nav atļauts strādāt. Viņiem nav tiesību ne uz valsts pabalstiem, ne uz dzīvesvietu. Viņi šodien ir neredzami un, iespējams, visneaizsargātākie Apvienotās Karalistes iedzīvotāji.<br/><br/>Pie nedokumentētiem (vai neregulāriem) migrantiem pieder arī tie, kas iesaistīti dzimumtirdzniecībā vai iekšzemes kalpībā; pie tiem pieder personas, kas pārsniedz atļauto uzturēšanās termiņu; pie tiem migrantiem, kuru patvēruma pieteikumi ir noraidīti, un pie citiem migrantiem imigrācijas sistēmā ir bijuši pārkāpumi. Tas viss, iespējams, ir ienācis Lielbritānijā legāli.<br/><br/>Nelegālie imigranti – tie, kas iedomājušies, ka valstī ir iebraukuši ar kravas automašīnām, – veido nelielu daļu no nedokumentētajiem imigrantiem.<br/><br/>Patiešām daži avoti liecina, ka puse no aplēstajiem 120,000 nedokumentētajiem bērniem Apvienotajā Karalistē faktiski ir dzimuši šeit nedokumentētiem vecākiem. Šie bērni ir nelabvēlīgā situācijā no dzimšanas, tikai viņu imigrācijas statusa dēļ.<br/><br/>Emuārs stāsta stāstus par nedokumentēto. Tas izceļ viņu ikdienas cīņas un neaizsargātību, kā arī viņu izturību un izturību.

| Sabbath School Lesson<br/><br/>In Galatians, Paul tackles issues such as freedom, the role of the law in salvation, our condition in Christ, and the nature of the Spirit-led life, as well as the age-old question, How can sinful humans be made right before a holy and just God?<br/><br/>Many scholars believe that Galatians may be the earliest of Paul's letters. It was written in A.D. 49, shortly after the famous Jerusalem Council (Acts 15). Therefore, the book may be the oldest Christian document known. As Acts and Galatians make clear, the early church found itself in a fierce battle over the nature of salvation, especially in the case of Gentiles. According to a group of Jewish believers, known as Judaizers, belief in Jesus alone was not good enough for Gentiles. Gentiles must also be circumcised and follow the laws of Moses (Acts 15:1).<br/><br/>This quarter's Bible study guide invites us to journey with the apostle Paul as he pleads with the Galatians to remain true to Jesus. It also gives us a chance to reflect on our own understanding of the truths that opened the way for Martin Luther's ultimate break with Rome and the restoration of the biblical gospel. | Sabata skola nodarbība<br/><br/>Galatiešiem Pāvils pievēršas tādiem jautājumiem kā brīvība, likuma loma pestīšanā, mūsu stāvoklis Kristū un Gara vadītās dzīves daba, kā arī mūžīgs jautājums: kā grēcīgos cilvēkus var padarīt par taisniem svēta un taisnīga Dieva priekšā?<br/><br/>Daudzi zinātnieki uzskata, ka Galatiešiem var būt agrākais no Pāvila vēstulēm. Tas tika rakstīts m.ē. 49, neilgi pēc slavenās Jeruzalemes padomes (Apustuļu darbi 15). Tāpēc grāmata var būt vecākais kristiešu dokuments zināms. Kā paskaidrots Apustuļu darbu grāmatā un Galatiešiem, agrīnā baznīca pieredzēja sīvu cīņu par glābšanu, it īpaši cittautiešiem. Saskaņā ar ebreju ticīgo grupu, kas pazīstama kā jūdaisti, ticība Jēzum vien nebija pietiekami laba pagāniem. Arī cittautiešiem jābūt apgraizītiem un jāievēro Mozus likumi (Ap.d.15:1).<br/><br/>Šī kvartāla Bībeles studiju ceļvedis aicina mūs ceļot kopā ar apustuli Pāvilu, kad viņš lūdz Galatiešiem palikt uzticīgi Jēzum. Tas arī dod mums iespēju pārdomāt mūsu pašu izpratni par patiesību, kas pavēra ceļu Mārtiņa Lutera galīgam pārtraukumam ar Romu un Bībeles evaņģēlija atjaunošanai. |

| Follow Us<br/><br/>ARE YOU AN<br/><br/>INSIDER<br/><br/>Craving Sugar? Here's What Your Body Is Trying to Tell You<br/><br/>by<br/>Byrdie<br/><br/>PHOTO:<br/><br/>Jacquemus<br/><br/>Weight gain from out-of-control cravings aside, it can be frustrating to have a constant hankering for something unhealthy and not know why. The good news is that there's usually a reason underlying that burning desire to house a bag of potato chips, or the feeling that you might actually die if you don't get a pickle rightthisinstant (even though you're not pregnant). If you're having visions of Milky Way bars, for example, it could mean that you're missing a very specific nutrient in your diet. (Yup—it's more complicated than said chocolate bar being so darn delicious.)<br/><br/>We talked to Los Angeles–based dietitian Shira Lenchewski, M.S., R.D., to get the skinny on some common food cravings, as well as what you can do to satiate the hunger without going overboard. Keep scrolling for some seriously good information!<br/><br/>If you're craving chocolate<br/><br/>It means: You could be lacking magnesium in your diet, says Lenchewski. "Magnesium is an essential mineral involved in energy production, glucose metabolism, and muscle function. This is especially true for those hitting the gym hard," she explains. Additionally, magnesium levels lower during the pre-menstrual weeks of your period, which explains why PMS so often comes with chocolate cravings.<br/><br/>Instead, reach for high-quality, low-sugar dark chocolate, which is naturally high in magnesium. "I recommend sticking to 75 per cent cocoa or higher, and pairing it with another magnesium-rich source like sunflower seeds," says Lenchewski. She suggests the chocolate brand Hu, a small-batch food company that focuses on high-quality ingredients produced locally. "It's a little pricey, but all the more reason to keep portions in check," she says. "It's my personal favourite." We're also big fans of superfood-packed Zenbunni.<br/><br/>If you're craving candy<br/><br/>It means: "Craving pure sugar is a good indication that you're running low on energy," says Lenchewski. "Think about it. What is the one thing you're itching for after a terrible night's sleep or at around 4 p.m. during a stressful workday? The answer is usually sugar because it's used as instant fuel for our body's cells."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for apples with nut butter. "If you're raiding your co-workers' candy stash, I recommend a more slow-burn carbohydrate with a source of fat or protein," says Lenchewski. "Unlike simple sugar, this will fuel your cells while avoiding the post-sugar crash. Two options that make for great pick-me-ups the next time you're craving candy: a sliced apple with your choice of nut butter, or berries with 2% unsweetened Greek yoghurt." We like quashing a sweet tooth with these addictive coconut chips, too—they're filling, free of any added sugar, and just so good.<br/><br/>If you're craving salt<br/><br/>It means: "If nothing but the saltiest pickle will do, you may not be drinking enough H2O," says Lenchewski. "Salt helps the body hold on to water, so we crave it when we're in need of fluids."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for water. "Stay hydrated, especially as we approach the summer months," she says. The next time a craving hits, try quenching it (literally) with a few refreshing glasses and you might find the urgency to sodium binge disappears. "If plain water bores you, try adding in mint, lemon, or frozen fruit to mix it up," says Lenchewski. And if that still doesn't do the trick, there's a healthier alternative to bagged chips or fries. "If you're really just craving salt after all, toasted seaweed is a great low-calorie option," she says.<br/><br/>If you're craving starchy carbs like pasta<br/><br/>It means: "Because high-carb foods boost the feel-good hormone serotonin, starch cravings can be a sign you're in need of a mood booster," says Lenchewski.<br/><br/>Instead, reach for a bath! "Bust out the Epsom salts, because it's time for some serious R+R," says Lenchewski. "Trust me. Indulging in a starch free-for-all feels really good in the moment, but it will likely bum you out more the next day." (As anyone who has ever over-indulged a pizza or pasta craving knows.) So the next time you want to dive head first into a bowl of carbs, draw a bath, light a candle, and treat yourself without any regret or dense calories.<br/><br/>If you're craving ice cream<br/><br/>5 / 6<br/><br/>It means: "Your body may be telling you it's in need of some healthy fat."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for coconut ice cream. "I'm a realist, so if you're craving ice cream, I'm not going to recommend a handful of walnuts, which are, of course, full of healthy fat," says Lenchewski. "For ice cream emergencies, I recommend lower-in-sugar coconut ice-creams like Coconut Bliss or Kippy's three-ingredient ice cream in Los Angeles." We can vouch for the fact that coconut ice cream tastes incredible and just like the real thing.<br/><br/>If you're craving a burger<br/><br/>It means: You need iron. "If you can't stop thinking about red meat, there's a chance your body is craving iron, b12 and folic acid," says Lenchewski. "This is especially true during or around that time of the month."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for a healthier burger. "I'm a proponent of grass fed, antibiotic and hormone-free red meat once a week," says Lenchewski. "Try experimenting with an open-faced bison burger—which, cut for cut, is leaner and has more iron than beef." Don't eat meat? Try to incorporate some kind of plant-based iron supplement into your routine, like spirulina. | Seko mums<br/><br/>VAI JŪS ESAT<br/><br/>INSIDER<br/><br/>Craving cukurs? Lūk, ko jūsu ķermenis mēģina jums pastāstīt<br/><br/>līdz<br/>Byrdie<br/><br/>FOTO:<br/><br/>Jacquemus<br/><br/>Svara pieaugums no out-of-kontroles alkas malā, tas var būt nomākta, ir pastāvīgi meklē kaut ko neveselīgu un nezinu, kāpēc. Labā ziņa ir tā, ka tur parasti ir iemesls, ka dedzināšana vēlme izmitināt maisu kartupeļu čipsi, vai sajūta, ka jūs faktiski varētu nomirt, ja jums nav iegūt sālījums tiesībasthistant (pat ja jūs neesat stāvoklī). Ja jums ir vīzijas Piena ceļa bāriem, piemēram, tas varētu nozīmēt, ka jums trūkst ļoti specifisku uzturvielu diētu. (Yup - tas ir sarežģītāk, nekā teica šokolādes bārs ir tik darn garšīgi.)<br/><br/>Mēs runājām ar Los Angeles-based dietologs Shira Lenchewski, M.S., R.D., lai iegūtu izdilis par kādu kopēju pārtikas cravings, kā arī to, ko jūs varat darīt, lai sātinātu badu bez iet pār bortu. Turpiniet ritināt uz kādu nopietni labu informāciju!<br/><br/>Ja vēlies šokolādi<br/><br/>Tas nozīmē: Jums var nebūt magnija jūsu uzturā, saka Lenchewski. "Magnijs ir būtisks minerāls, kas iesaistīts enerģijas ražošanā, glikozes metabolismā un muskuļu funkcijās. Tas jo īpaši attiecas uz tiem, kas smagi skar sporta zāli," viņa skaidro. Turklāt magnija līmenis ir zemāks perioda pirmsmenstruālajās nedēļās, kas izskaidro, kāpēc PMS tik bieži nāk ar šokolādes cravings.<br/><br/>Tā vietā, sasniegt augstas kvalitātes, zemu cukura līmeni tumšā šokolāde, kas ir dabiski augsts magnija. "Es ieteiktu pieturoties līdz 75 procentiem kakao vai augstāka, un pārī ar citu magnija bagātu avotu, piemēram, saulespuķu sēklas," saka Lenchewski. Viņa iesaka šokolādes zīmolu Hu, mazu partiju pārtikas uzņēmums, kas koncentrējas uz augstas kvalitātes sastāvdaļām, kas ražotas uz vietas. "Tas ir nedaudz pricey, bet vēl jo vairāk iemesls, lai saglabātu porcijas pārbaude," viņa saka. "Tas ir mans personīgais favorīts." Mēs esam arī lieli fani superfood iepakotu Zenbunni.<br/><br/>Ja jūs alkstat konfektes<br/><br/>Tas nozīmē: "Tīra cukura taupīšana ir laba norāde, ka jums ir zems enerģijas līmenis," saka Lenchewski. "Padomā par to. Kāda ir viena lieta, ko jūs nieze pēc briesmīga nakts miega vai aptuveni 4 pēcpusdienā stresa dienas laikā? Atbilde parasti ir cukurs, jo to izmanto kā tūlītēju degvielu mūsu ķermeņa šūnām.<br/><br/>Tā vietā sasniedziet ābolus ar riekstu sviestu. "Ja jūs raiding savu kolēģu konfektes atlicināt, es ieteiktu vairāk lēni sadedzināt ogļhidrātu ar tauku vai olbaltumvielu avots," saka Lenchewski. "Atšķirībā no vienkārša cukura, tas būs degvielas jūsu šūnas, vienlaikus izvairoties no post-cukura crash. Divas iespējas, kas padara lielisku pick-me-ups nākamreiz, kad jūs alkas konfektes: šķēlēs ābolu ar savu izvēli riekstu sviestu, vai ogas ar 2% nesaldināts grieķu jogurtu. " Mums patīk quashing salds zobs ar šiem atkarību kokosriekstu mikroshēmas, pārāk, viņi piepilda, bez jebkāda pievienotā cukura, un tikai tik labi.<br/><br/>Ja jūs alkstat sāli<br/><br/>Tas nozīmē: "Ja nekas, bet sāļākais sālījums darīs, jūs nedrīkstat dzert pietiekami daudz H2O," saka Lenchewski. "Sāls palīdz ķermenim turēties pie ūdens, tāpēc mēs to alkstam, kad mums ir vajadzīgi šķidrumi."<br/><br/>Tā vietā sasniedziet ūdeni. "Palieciet hidratēts, it īpaši, ja mēs tuvojamies vasaras mēnešiem," viņa saka. Nākamajā reizē, kad tieksmi hits, mēģiniet to atdzesēt (burtiski) ar dažām atsvaidzinošām brillēm, un jūs varētu atrast steidzamību nātrija iedzeršana pazūd. "Ja tīru ūdeni nesa jums, mēģiniet pievienojot piparmētru, citronu vai saldētu augļu sajauc to uz augšu," saka Lenchewski. Un, ja tas joprojām nav darīt triks, tur ir veselīgāka alternatīva maisos čipsi vai kartupeļi. "Ja jūs patiešām vienkārši vēlaties sāli, grauzdētas jūraszāles ir lieliska mazkaloriju izvēle," viņa saka.<br/><br/>Ja jūs alkstat cieti saturošus ogļhidrātus, piemēram, makaronus<br/><br/>Tas nozīmē: "Tā kā augsta carb pārtika palielināt justies labi hormons serotonīna, cietes cravings var būt zīme, jūs esat nepieciešama garastāvokļa pastiprinātājs," saka Lenchewski.<br/><br/>Tā vietā, sasniegt vannā! "Bust out Epsom sāļi, jo ir pienācis laiks kādu nopietnu R + R," saka Lenchewski. "Uzticieties man. Indulging ar cieti free-for-all jūtas ļoti labs brīdī, bet tas būs iespējams pakaļ jums vairāk nākamajā dienā. " (Kā zina ikviens, kurš kādreiz ir pārāk iedzēris picu vai makaronus.) Nākamreiz, kad vēlaties vispirms ienirt bļodā ar ogļhidrātiem, uzzīmējiet vannu, aizdedziniet sveci un palutiniet sevi bez nožēlas vai blīvām kalorijām.<br/><br/>Ja jūs alkstat pēc saldējuma<br/><br/>5 / 6<br/><br/>Tas nozīmē: "Jūsu ķermenis, iespējams, jums saka, ka tam ir vajadzīgi daži veselīgi tauki."<br/><br/>Tā vietā sasniedziet kokosriekstu saldējumu. "Es esmu reālists, tādēļ, ja jūs vēlaties saldējumu, es neiesaku nedaudz valriekstu, kas, protams, ir pilni ar veselīgiem taukiem," saka Lenčevskis. "Saldējuma ārkārtas situācijās es iesaku zemāku cukura kokosriekstu saldējumu, piemēram, Coconut Bliss vai Kippy trīs sastāvdaļu saldējumu Losandželosā." Mēs varam galvot par to, ka kokosriekstu saldējums garšo neticami un tāpat kā reālā lieta.<br/><br/>Ja jūs vēlaties burgeru<br/><br/>Tas nozīmē: Jums ir nepieciešams dzelzs. "Ja jūs nevarat pārtraukt domāt par sarkano gaļu, pastāv iespēja, ka jūsu ķermenis vēlas dzelzi, b12 un folijskābi," saka Lenchewski. "Tas jo īpaši attiecas uz šo mēneša laiku vai ap to."<br/><br/>Tā vietā sasniedziet veselīgāku burgeru. "Es esmu zāles, antibiotiku un hormonu nesaturošas sarkanās gaļas atbalstītājs reizi nedēļā," saka Lenčevskis. "Mēģiniet eksperimentēt ar vaļēju bizonu burgeru - kas, sagriezts griešanai, ir mazāks un ir vairāk dzelzs nekā liellopu gaļa." Neēd gaļu? Mēģiniet iekļaut sava veida augu bāzes dzelzs papildinājumu savā rutīnā, piemēram, spirulīna. |

| Web Services, Vendors And Cyber Laws!<br/><br/>Updated On:April 21, 2014Bilal Ahmad<br/><br/>Computerization of this world changed human performance scenario to a great extent and that too beyond measurement. For instance, Now you can send vital information all across the globe with a single mouse click, thanks to internet connectivity. Sadly, it is this wide connectivity and popularity among people, internet has also increased chances for computer crimes. Internet crimes or computer crimes are widely known as 'Cyber Crimes'.<br/><br/>'Cyber Laws' is something new in the judiciary system but has gained a lot of attention lately. The term cyber crime is something very synonymous with conventional crime, the only difference being medium of execution. There are majorly two types of cyber crimes, the first one is in which computers are the main targets and these include cases of data damage, malicious code and even criminal data access. The second one is in which computer is only a tool using which conventional crimes are committed for eg cyber terrorism, spamming, cyber stalking and many more.<br/><br/>This is where a website consultant or a vendor comes into scene. Although not aware of all the cyber laws present till date, a website vendor can advise you on some of the most vital cyber laws while creating your site.<br/><br/>This may include common knowledge of copy rights or even protecting the content of your own website. Explaining you all the rights you posses as a website owner is also one the tasks a website vendor may do while developing your website. A vendor can also assist you by offering you information on different cyber laws to protect data. Besides all of this, a vendor can also offer you information on any new cyber law that you may not be aware of till know. Cyber laws may vary from nation to nation, one recent example can be of the cookie law released in the United Kingdom, which prevents the website from saving any user browsing data. As per the Cookie Law, websites in the United Kingdom cannot save cookie files without informational consent from the surfer.<br/><br/>It is after the implementation of such law, websites now have a pop-up window, which seeks the consent of the visitor for saving cookies files. Such files are used by websites to analyze the browsing pattern of visitors based on which advertisements are then posted on a user window. With hacking not anymore a new thing for all of us, do you think such rules and regulations can prevent online forgery or cyber crime? Technology has developed at a rapid rate but still people do not prefer shopping online due to fear of personal or bank account details getting hacked. With the rise of cyber crime, need of stringent cyber laws have also increased to curb the same and to promote a risk free shopping experience.<br/><br/>Classes of Cyber Crimes<br/><br/>Over the years there have been three major classes of cyber crimes:<br/><br/>Unauthorized access of computer system cases, which involves hacking or stealing usernames and passwords to gain access over personal information of the respective user. These kind of backdoor access are organized with the help of Trojan Horse. Releasing malicious programs like Trojan House, worms or computer viruses etc. The last class includes cyber stalking a user or online harassment .<br/><br/>Direct implications of Cyber crimes<br/><br/>Decrease in sales<br/><br/>Decrease in staff output due to network delays<br/><br/>Loss of personalized information like research work<br/><br/>Disruption in communication process<br/><br/>Indirect implications of Cyber crimes<br/><br/>Credibility issue in our financial system<br/><br/>Brand image is tarnished in the market<br/><br/>Cyber crimes affect business to business relationship in the market<br/><br/>Sense of trust in state policies and government agencies is lost<br/><br/>Preventing Cyber Crime<br/><br/>As netizens there are certain precautions that we should consider for a safe and secure online experience. Here are some of them:<br/><br/>First thing to do will be to keep personal information to your self and avoid sharing the same online.<br/><br/>Avoid sharing any photographs with online chat friends or strangers.<br/><br/>Installing latest version of anti-virus on your system can offer you a good line of defense against internet threats like viruses and malware.<br/><br/>Keeping back up of your valuable data is a good option to avoid problems like virus contamination.<br/><br/>Avoid sending credit card information to sites that are unsecured and don't have any valid certificate.<br/><br/>Installing safety programme that offers you control over site cookies and saves you from being tracked by websites.<br/><br/>Putting host-based intrusions detection devices on servers will help you keep track of irregularities on your website traffic.<br/><br/>Use of firewall is advised.<br/><br/>Why Cyber attacks are so popular?<br/><br/>Cheaper than traditional cheating methods<br/><br/>Tracking cyber crimes are not easy<br/><br/>Exact locations cannot be tracked easily<br/><br/>Absence of physical barrier in the internet world<br/><br/>Cyber crimes affect large number of people<br/><br/>Conclusion<br/><br/>The fact that human mind has unfathomable power is undeniable, which is why internet crimes are increasing at a tremendous rate. Even history has witnessed some of the greatest internet security gone kaput by the hands of hackers, who have easily got away too. The only way to curb such crime is to remain aware of the cyber laws that we have today, that can either be through internet or through website/IT vendors. Information Technology Act has to be balanced in such a way that it proves too stringent for people who are involved in cyber crimes and at the same time it should never hamper the growth of Internet industry.<br/><br/>Author Bio:– Maneet Puri at present is heading a quality web design firm located at New Delhi, India.

Piemēram, tagad jūs varat nosūtīt svarīgu informāciju visā pasaulē ar vienu peles klikšķi, pateicoties interneta savienojumam. Diemžēl tā ir šī plašā savienojamība un popularitāte cilvēku vidū, internets ir arī palielinājis iespējas datornoziegumiem. Interneta noziegumi vai datornoziegumi ir plaši pazīstami kā "kibernoziegumi".<br/><br/>"Kiberlikumi" ir kaut kas jauns tiesu sistēmā, bet pēdējā laikā ir ieguvis lielu uzmanību. Termins kibernoziedzība ir kaut kas ļoti sinonīms tradicionālajam noziegumam, vienīgā atšķirība ir izpildes vidēja. Ir galvenokārt divu veidu kibernoziegumi, pirmais ir, kurā datori ir galvenie mērķi, un tie ietver gadījumus datu bojājumus, ļaunprātīgu kodu un pat noziedzīgu datu piekļuvi. Otrais ir tas, kurā dators ir tikai rīks, ar kuru tiek veikti parastie noziegumi, piemēram, kiberterorisms, surogātpasts, kibernoziegumi un daudz kas cits.<br/><br/>Tas ir, ja mājas lapā konsultants vai pārdevējs nonāk skatuves. Lai gan nav informēti par visiem kibernoziegumu likumus līdz šim, mājas lapas pārdevējs var ieteikt dažus no svarīgākajiem kibernoziegumu likumus, vienlaikus izveidojot savu vietni.<br/><br/>Tas var ietvert kopīgas zināšanas par kopēšanas tiesībām vai pat savas vietnes satura aizsardzību. Izskaidrojot jums visas tiesības, kas jums pieder kā vietnes īpašniekam, ir arī viens no uzdevumiem, ko vietnes pārdevējs var veikt, izstrādājot jūsu vietni. Pārdevējs var arī palīdzēt jums, piedāvājot jums informāciju par dažādiem kibernoziegumu likumiem, lai aizsargātu datus. Bez tam, pārdevējs var arī piedāvāt jums informāciju par jebkuru jaunu kibernoziegumu likumu, kas jums var nebūt informēti līdz zināt. Kiberlikumi dažādās valstīs var atšķirties, viens nesens piemērs var būt Apvienotajā Karalistē publicētais sīkdatņu likums, kas neļauj tīmekļa vietnei saglabāt jebkādus lietotāju pārlūkošanas datus. Saskaņā ar Sīkfailu likumu, tīmekļa vietnes Apvienotajā Karalistē nevar saglabāt sīkfailus bez informācijas piekrišanas no surfer.<br/><br/>Tas ir pēc šāda likuma ieviešanas, tīmekļa vietnēm tagad ir uznirstošais logs, kas lūdz apmeklētāja piekrišanu sīkfailu failu saglabāšanai. Šādus failus tīmekļa vietnes izmanto, lai analizētu apmeklētāju pārlūkošanas modeli, pamatojoties uz to, kuras reklāmas pēc tam tiek publicētas lietotāja logā. Ar Datorurķēšana vairs nav jauna lieta mums visiem, vai jūs domājat, ka šādi noteikumi un noteikumi var novērst tiešsaistes viltošanu vai kibernoziedzību? Tehnoloģija ir attīstījusies strauji, bet joprojām cilvēki nevēlas iepirkties tiešsaistē, jo baidās no personas vai bankas konta informāciju kļūst hacked. Pieaugot kibernoziedzībai, ir palielinājusies nepieciešamība pēc stingriem kiberlikumiem, lai ierobežotu to pašu un veicinātu bezriska iepirkšanās pieredzi.<br/><br/>Kibernoziegumu klasifikācija<br/><br/>Gadu gaitā ir bijuši trīs galvenie kibernoziegumu veidi:<br/><br/>Neatļauta piekļuve datorsistēmu gadījumos, kas ietver hakeru vai zagt lietotājvārdus un paroles, lai piekļūtu vairāk nekā personas informāciju par attiecīgo lietotāju.
