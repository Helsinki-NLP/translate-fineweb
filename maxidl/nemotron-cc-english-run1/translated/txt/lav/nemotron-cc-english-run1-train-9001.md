| UNDERSTANDING SELF-EXECUTING TREATIES VIA STATE PRACTICE<br/><br/>Updated: Feb 2<br/><br/>Introduction:<br/><br/>Consider this paradox, when a country ratifies a treaty, it is said to have consented to accept the treaty in its entirety (reservations and declarations being exceptions); but in some cases, the countries go ahead and refuse to adhere to its provisions. For example, Article VI, Clause 2 of the American Constitution has the provisions that "all treaties … shall be the supreme Law of the Land." Although it is evident that treaties on their own do not have the same effect as federal laws. In truth, they only become operational once these provisions come into force as Federal law with Senate and Presidential approval. Although this is the practice, it is a generally accepted principle in international law that certain treaties have a binding effect on countries. The treaty must fulfil the requirement of being a self-executing treaty to affect the country without any corresponding domestic legislature directly.<br/><br/>This raises the question as to which treaty will qualify as "self-executing" and which will not?<br/><br/>Whether a treaty is a self-executing treaty or not is decided by national judges on a case-to-case basis (Buergenthal, 1992). In order to understand this, the paper will first look at the two types of theories followed by countries on the nature of treaties applying to domestic law. These two theories are monism and dualism. They basically view the framework of domestic and international law as a single hierarchy and two separate hierarchies, respectively (Wildhaber, 1971). Countries following monism believe that certain treaties immediately are binding and immediately have an effect on the country. Once the treaty has been ratified, it can be invoked in national courts and is considered to be a part of the law of the country. Countries following dualism believe that a treaty does not affect domestic law until it has been reinforced by a legislature passed in the parliament. An example of dualism is how the European Convention on Human Rights became operational in the United Kingdom after passing the Human Rights Act 1998 in their parliament (Laws, 2000).<br/><br/>International law is diverse, and so are the types of procedures different countries follow for the acceptance of treaties. Some constitutions' themselves mention the procedures for the ratification of a treaty. Some countries even have different treatment given to international treaty law and customary international law. Certain international organizations like the European Union often affect the domestic law of its member states. The member states of the European Union have to give effect to certain forms of community legislature. Although, it has an essential difference from self-executing treaties. The difference is that it is not for national judges to decide whether the provisions are self-executing or not, but rather for the European Court of Justice to interpret under its constitutive treaties. Other forms of international law formed via resolutions or such might not have the same effect for these states. Nevertheless, they might consider them as forms of "soft law" and look into them to interpret the intent of the law. Sometimes, proclamations made by the judicial organs of international organizations such as the Inter-American Court of Human Rights affect their member states. Although these proclamations are not binding on the member states, the national judges seem to refer to these for authoritative interpretation.<br/><br/>Therefore, a case-to-case approach must be taken while analyzing the procedures and precedents set in different countries. To examine the concept of self-executing treaties, this paper will compare the precedents set by different jurisdictions. If the reader wishes to conduct a similar analysis, they can do so by looking into the different national yearbooks on international law. Mostly, these yearbooks will have a section devoted to the relationship between international and national law.<br/><br/>International Jurisprudence:<br/><br/>The most significant issue that comes up for national courts is whether the treaty is self-executing? If the treaty can be applied without any additional domestic legislature having passed to reinforce it. This question came up in the case of Czesław S v State Treasury and Minister of the State Treasury, wherein the Polish Constitutional Court held that since the treaty provisions referred to domestic measures to be taken, the treaty was not self-executing in nature (Bug river claims, Czesław S v State Treasury and Minister of the State Treasury, 2003). Essentially, when the treaty refers to domestic measures to be taken, it does not in itself create new obligations. It instead reinforces the treaty's intent for the domestic legal process to take measures for the same. A similar issue was raised in the Sosa case in the United States of America. In this case, the court considered whether the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights was a self-executing treaty. The American Supreme Court has also declared that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is not a self-executing treaty (Court, 2004). The Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland also examined the self-executing nature of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The issue before the court was whether Article 13(2)(b) and (c) were self-executing in nature. The court examined whether the treaty was partially self-executing and did so by checking whether there existed a minimum core content for the treaty to be applicable. The court held that it found no such provision within the treaty (A and B v Government of the Canton of Zurich, 2000).<br/><br/>It is essential to understand that these issues differ from the fundamental question of whether international law can be applied as part of the law of the land? In order to answer this question, the paper will examine the judgement by the Supreme Court of the Dominican Republic. The Supreme Court stated that Article 3 of the Dominican Republic's Constitution made international law binding on the domestic legal order. The court rejected the Superior Land Court's interpretation that these treaties were "foreign legislature" and not part of the domestic legal order. The Supreme Court laid down that all treaties ratified by the Dominican Republic formed a part of Dominican Law and, therefore, can be termed as self-executing (Gallardo Montilla v Gallardo Concepción and ors, 1997). The Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland has examined whether the Libson Treaty was self-executing and directly applicable to Swiss Universities. The court held, "According to relevant case law, a treaty norm is directly applicable if its content is sufficiently precise and clear to form the basis of a decision in a particular case. The norm thus has to be justiciable, i.e. define the rights and obligations of an individual and be directed at the competent authorities" (X v University of Lucerne, 2014). This implies that whether the treaty is directly applicable or not, depends upon on whether the norm is justiciable. The Lisbon Treaty is based on the principle of qualifications acquired aboard. This is conveyed through Article IV (1) of the treaty. The purpose of this was to create an obligation for states to show that their decision-making process is fair, transparent and non-discriminatory. The responsibility for proving that the applicant has not met the required criteria is on the "body undertaking the assessment." The treaty guarantees procedural safeguards, which are generally accepted by countries and hence, the court held this treaty to be self-executing. This goes on to showcase the different interpretations undertaken by the courts of various countries.<br/><br/>It is essential to observe whether the norms set out by treaties are actually being complied with. The case laws from various jurisdictions have emphasized that national courts are the final authority on the issue of whether a treaty is self-executing. There is also an inherent duty cast on countries for the observance and due performance of treaties. Such is cast by the Pacta Sunt Servanda rule as enshrined within Article 26 of the Vienna Convention on Law of Treaties (VCLT). Article 27 goes on to reinforce it by stating that international law obligations cannot be ignored by using domestic law as a justification. Many countries' courts have used this as a source of interpretation, such as the Latvian Constitutional Court. In the case of a national norm conflicting with an international norm, the court held that the national norm was null and void. To reach its conclusion, the court strongly relied on the necessary performance of treaties in good faith as envisaged in Article 26 of the VCLT (Linija v Latvia, 2004).<br/><br/>Conclusion:<br/><br/>From the above, it is clear that treaties have particular requirements before they can be considered self-executing. However, keeping all of these aside, the most important still remains the national courts' interpretation. The national courts decide whether the treaty can be called self-executing or not. Although their Constitution's might contain a provision regarding treaty law being the supreme law of the land, courts from different countries interpret these provisions in different manners. This can be seen as to how the American and Dominican Constitutions' both contain these provisions but follow completely different interpretations of the same. The term "self-executing" may not be congruous for these treaties since, in practice, they still need approval from the national courts. Ideally, the way forward should be that countries acknowledge the self-executing nature of treaties and treat them in a fashion wherein Article 26 and 27 of the VCLT are respected. Again, this is the "ideal" situation and is not likely to find its way into state practice of certain jurisdictions anytime soon. Still, hope can be gained via looking into the interpretations of national courts that respect these norms and hopefully pave the way for other courts to acknowledge this.<br/><br/>References:<br/><br/>Buergenthal, T.

Piemēram, Amerikas Konstitūcijas VI panta 2. punktā ir noteikumi, ka "visi līgumi ... ir augstākais zemes likums". Lai gan ir skaidrs, ka līgumiem pašiem par sevi nav tādas pašas sekas kā federālajiem likumiem. Patiesībā tie sāk darboties tikai tad, kad šie noteikumi stājas spēkā kā federālais likums ar senātu un prezidenta apstiprinājumu. Lai gan tā ir prakse, starptautiskajos tiesību aktos ir vispārpieņemts princips, ka konkrētiem līgumiem ir saistoša ietekme uz valstīm. Līgumam ir jāatbilst prasībai, ka līgums ir pašizpildošs līgums, kas ietekmē valsti, tieši neiesaistot attiecīgo vietējo likumdevēju.<br/><br/>Tas rada jautājumu par to, kurš līgums tiks kvalificēts kā "pašizpildes" un kurš netiks?<br/><br/>Par to, vai līgums ir pašizpildes līgums vai ne, lemj valstu tiesneši katrā gadījumā atsevišķi (Buergenthal, 1992). Lai to saprastu, dokumentā vispirms tiks apskatītas divu veidu teorijas, kurām seko valstis par līgumu raksturu, kas attiecas uz vietējiem tiesību aktiem. Šīs divas teorijas ir monisms un duālisms. Viņi pamatā uzskata vietējo un starptautisko tiesību sistēmu par vienotu hierarhiju un divām atsevišķām hierarhijām, attiecīgi (Wildhaber, 1971). Valstis, kas seko monismam, uzskata, ka daži līgumi nekavējoties ir saistoši un nekavējoties ietekmē valsti. Kad līgums ir ratificēts, to var atsaukties valstu tiesās un tiek uzskatīts par daļu no valsts tiesību aktiem. Valstis, kas seko duālismam, uzskata, ka līgums neietekmē valsts tiesību aktus, kamēr to nav pastiprinājis likumdevējs. Viens no duālisma piemēriem ir tas, kā Eiropas Cilvēktiesību konvencija sāka darboties Apvienotajā Karalistē pēc 1998. gada Cilvēktiesību likuma pieņemšanas savā parlamentā (Likumi, 2000).<br/><br/>Starptautiskās tiesības ir daudzveidīgas, tāpat arī procedūru veidi, ko dažādas valstis ievēro līgumu pieņemšanā.Dažas konstitūcijas pašas piemin līguma ratifikācijas procedūras. Dažās valstīs pat ir atšķirīga attieksme pret starptautiskajām līgumu tiesībām un paražu starptautiskajām tiesībām. Dažas starptautiskās organizācijas, piemēram, Eiropas Savienība, bieži ietekmē tās dalībvalstu vietējos tiesību aktus. Eiropas Savienības dalībvalstīm ir jāīsteno noteiktas Kopienu likumdošanas formas. Lai gan tai ir būtiska atšķirība no pašizpildes līgumiem. Atšķirība ir tāda, ka valstu tiesnešiem nav jālemj par to, vai noteikumi attiecas uz pašizpildi vai ne, bet gan par to, vai Eiropas Kopienu Tiesa tos interpretē saskaņā ar saviem konstitucionālajiem līgumiem. Citām starptautisko tiesību formām, kas izveidotas ar rezolūcijām, var nebūt tādas pašas sekas attiecībā uz šīm valstīm. Tomēr tās var uzskatīt par "ieteikuma tiesību" formām un izpētīt tās, lai interpretētu likuma nodomu. Dažreiz starptautisko organizāciju, piemēram, Amerikas Cilvēktiesību tiesas, tiesu iestāžu paziņojumi ietekmē to dalībvalstis. Lai gan šie paziņojumi nav saistoši dalībvalstīm, šķiet, ka valstu tiesneši uz tiem atsaucas kā uz autoritatīvu interpretāciju.<br/><br/>Tāpēc, analizējot procedūras un precedentus, kas noteikti dažādās valstīs, ir jāizmanto individuāla pieeja. Lai pārbaudītu līgumu pašizpildes jēdzienu, šajā dokumentā tiks salīdzināti precedenti, kas noteikti dažādās jurisdikcijās. Ja lasītājs vēlas veikt līdzīgu analīzi, to var izdarīt, aplūkojot dažādas valsts gadagrāmatas par starptautiskajām tiesībām. Galvenokārt, šajos gadagrāmatās būs sadaļa, kas veltīta starptautisko un valsts tiesību attiecībām.<br/><br/>Starptautiskā jurisprudence:<br/><br/>Visnozīmīgākais jautājums, kas rodas valstu tiesām, ir tas, vai līgums ir pašizpildīts? Ja līgumu var piemērot, nepievienojot papildu vietējo likumdevēju, lai to pastiprinātu. Šis jautājums tika uzdots lietā, kurā tika pasludināts spriedums lietā Czes-aw S/Valsts kase un Valsts kases ministrs, kurā Polijas Konstitucionālā tiesa nosprieda, ka, ņemot vērā līguma noteikumus, kas attiecas uz iekšzemes pasākumiem, līgums nav pašizpilde pēc būtības (Bug river claims, Czes-aw S/Valsts kase un Valsts kases ministrs, 2003. gads). Būtībā, ja līgums attiecas uz veicamajiem iekšzemes pasākumiem, tas pats par sevi nerada jaunas saistības, bet gan pastiprina līguma mērķi, lai valsts tiesas process veiktu pasākumus par to pašu. Līdzīgs jautājums tika izvirzīts Sosas lietā Amerikas Savienotajās Valstīs. Šajā gadījumā tiesa izskatīja, vai Starptautiskais pakts par pilsoniskajām un politiskajām tiesībām ir pašizpildes līgums. Amerikas Augstākā tiesa ir arī paziņojusi, ka Starptautiskais pakts par pilsoniskajām un politiskajām tiesībām nav pašizpildes līgums (Tiesa, 2004). Šveices Federālā Augstākā tiesa arī pārbaudīja Starptautiskā pakta par pilsoniskajām un politiskajām tiesībām pašizpildes raksturu. Jautājums tiesā bija par to, vai 13. panta 2. punkta b) un c) apakšpunkts ir pašizpildes raksturs. Tiesa pārbaudīja, vai līgums ir daļēji pašizpildīts, un pārbaudīja, vai pastāv minimālais saturs, lai līgums būtu piemērojams. Tiesa nosprieda, ka līgumā šāda tiesību norma nav konstatēta (Cīrihes kantona valdība A un B/2000).<br/><br/>Ir svarīgi saprast, ka šie jautājumi atšķiras no pamatjautājuma par to, vai starptautiskās tiesības var piemērot kā daļu no zemes likuma? Lai atbildētu uz šo jautājumu, dokumentā tiks pārbaudīts Dominikānas Republikas Augstākās tiesas spriedums. Augstākā tiesa paziņoja, ka Dominikānas Republikas Konstitūcijas 3. pants padara starptautiskās tiesības saistošas valsts tiesību sistēmai. Tiesa noraidīja Augstākās zemes tiesas interpretāciju, ka šie līgumi bija "ārvalstu likumdevējs", nevis daļa no valsts tiesiskās kārtības. Augstākā tiesa noteica, ka visi Dominikānas Republikas ratificētie līgumi ir daļa no Dominikānas tiesību aktiem un tāpēc tos var nosaukt par pašizpildes līgumiem (Gallardo Montilla pret Gallardo Concepcion un ors, 1997). Šveices Federālā Augstākā tiesa ir pārbaudījusi, vai Libson līgums bija pašizpildes un tieši piemērojama Šveices universitātēm. Tiesa nosprieda: "Saskaņā ar attiecīgo tiesu praksi, līguma norma ir tieši piemērojama, ja tās saturs ir pietiekami precīzs un skaidrs, lai būtu lēmuma pamatā konkrētā lietā. Tādējādi normai ir jābūt attaisnojamai, t.i., jādefinē indivīda tiesības un pienākumi, un tā jāadresē kompetentajām iestādēm" (X pret Lucernas universitāti, 2014). Tas nozīmē, ka tas, vai līgums ir vai nav tieši piemērojams, ir atkarīgs no tā, vai norma ir attaisnojama.Lisabonas līgums ir balstīts uz uz kuģa iegūto kvalifikāciju principu. Tā mērķis bija noteikt valstīm pienākumu pierādīt, ka to lēmumu pieņemšanas process ir godīgs, pārredzams un nediskriminējošs. Iestāde, kas veic novērtēšanu, ir atbildīga par to, lai pierādītu, ka pieteikuma iesniedzējs nav izpildījis prasītos kritērijus. Līgums garantē procesuālās garantijas, kas ir vispārpieņemtas valstīs, un līdz ar to tiesa uzskatīja, ka šis līgums ir pašizpildīts. Tas turpinās, lai parādītu dažādās interpretācijas, ko veic dažādu valstu tiesas.<br/><br/>Būtiski ir novērot, vai līgumos noteiktās normas faktiski tiek ievērotas. Dažādu jurisdikciju tiesu prakse ir uzsvērusi, ka valstu tiesas ir galīgā autoritāte jautājumā par to, vai līgums ir pašizpilde. Pastāv arī raksturīgs pienākums pret valstīm par līgumu ievērošanu un pienācīgu izpildi. To nosaka Pacta Sunt Servanda noteikums, kas noteikts Vīnes konvencijas par līgumu tiesībām (VCLT) 26. pantā. 27. pants to papildina, nosakot, ka starptautisko tiesību saistības nevar ignorēt, par attaisnojumu izmantojot nacionālos tiesību aktus. Daudzu valstu tiesas to ir izmantojušas kā interpretācijas avotu, piemēram, Satversmes tiesa. Gadījumā, ja valsts norma ir pretrunā starptautiskai normai, tiesa nosprieda, ka valsts norma ir spēkā neesoša. Lai nonāktu pie slēdziena, tiesa stingri paļāvās uz VKLT 26.pantā paredzēto labticīgi noslēgto līgumu izpildi (Līnija pret Latviju, 2004).<br/><br/>Secinājums:<br/><br/>No iepriekš minētā ir skaidrs, ka līgumiem ir īpašas prasības, pirms tos var uzskatīt par pašizpildošiem, tomēr, paturot tos visus malā, vissvarīgākais joprojām ir valstu tiesu interpretācija. Valstu tiesas lemj, vai līgumu var saukt par pašizpildi vai ne. Lai gan to Konstitūcijas varētu ietvert noteikumu par līgumtiesībām, kas ir augstākais likums par zemi, tiesas no dažādām valstīm interpretēt šos noteikumus dažādos veidos. To var uzskatīt par to, kā Amerikas un Dominikānas konstitūcijās gan satur šos noteikumus, bet seko pilnīgi atšķirīgas interpretācijas par vienu un to pašu. Jēdziens “pašizpilde” attiecībā uz šiem līgumiem var nebūt atbilstošs, jo praksē tiem joprojām ir nepieciešams valstu tiesu apstiprinājums. Ideālā gadījumā turpmākā virzība būtu tāda, ka valstis atzīst līgumu pašizpildes raksturu un izturas pret tiem tādā veidā, ka tiek ievērots VKLT 26. un 27. pants. Atkal, šī ir "ideāla" situācija, un ir maz ticams, lai atrastu savu ceļu uz valsts praksi dažās jurisdikcijās jebkurā tuvākajā laikā. Tomēr cerību var iegūt, aplūkojot valstu tiesu interpretācijas, kas ievēro šīs normas un, cerams, paver ceļu citām tiesām to atzīt.<br/><br/>Atsauces:<br/><br/>Buergenthal, T. (1992).

| Behind-the-Scenes Tragedies That Affected the Cast of TV's Deadliest Catch<br/><br/>Lowered Fishing Quotas<br/><br/>Even though the crew on Deadliest Catch make the majority of their money from Discovery, that doesn't mean they don't actually sell their haul. So, you could say they have two sources of income, which is something that most people in their line of work don't have.<br/><br/>However, back in 2017, the Alaska Department of Fish and Game started a quota system, which limited the amount of fish any fishing boat could bring back to shore by half. That meant the crew on Deadliest Catch experienced a huge drop in profits for several years. Hey, at least they have Discovery to pay the bills, right? | Aizkulises traģēdijas, kas ietekmēja televīzijas visnāvējošāko lomu<br/><br/>Samazinātas zvejas kvotas<br/><br/>Pat ja apkalpe par Deadliest Catch padarīt lielāko daļu savas naudas no Discovery, tas nenozīmē, ka tie nav faktiski pārdot savu iemetienu. Tātad, jūs varētu teikt, ka viņiem ir divi ienākumu avoti, kas ir kaut kas, kas vairumam cilvēku viņu darba līnijā nav.<br/><br/>Tomēr 2017. gadā Aļaskas Zivju un medību departaments sāka kvotu sistēmu, kas ierobežoja zivju daudzumu, ko jebkura zvejas laiva varētu atgriezties krastā uz pusi. Tas nozīmēja, ka apkalpei uz Deadliest Catch vairākus gadus piedzīvoja milzīgu peļņas kritumu. |

| BLOGS<br/><br/>Check out our collection of blogs written by fellow staff members.<br/><br/>INFORMATIONAL BLOGS<br/><br/>Don't Stress It<br/><br/>by<br/>Kristen Hogan<br/>&#124; Nov 12, 2020<br/><br/>Stress, no matter how great things are going, it can always find a way to rear its ugly head. Whether it is a last-minute job request or a paper that you forgot to write and it is due the next day, stress can always find a way into your day if you allow it. Today I will show you a few things you can do to eliminate or prevent stress.<br/><br/>The first thing you can do is to exercise. Exercising is a great way to relieve stress because it lowers the stress hormone in your body known as cortisol. The lower levels of cortisol in your body, the lower your stress level will be. Exercise can also increase your confidence, and when your confidence is up then your stress is usually down. For me, when I get stressed, I always exercise by going to the gym and practice boxing, it helps me burn calories and reduce stress while having fun.<br/><br/>Writing things down has been a way to calm people down for a very long time, and it is the next topic on our list. Writing down what is making you stressed is a way to clear the mind, and it helps get rid of stress as well. I have a similar experience when writing stories, usually if I cannot think of a new idea because of an old one, I will write the old idea down and think on it. That is when new ideas start to spring up and I can continue writing normally. It is the same with stress. Think about a stream it continues to flow down it's path until it hits a beaver dam, and that dam blocks the flow of water and everything starts to build up. The only way to get the water flow back to normal is to remove the dam. This is where writing comes in. When you write it down, you are removing stress piece by piece until you can think normally again.<br/><br/>Stress can come into our lives through doors in our life that we keep open. Procrastination is a way that we can leave the doors open for stress. Waiting until tomorrow may be fun for today, but it will hurt you tomorrow, and is a very short-sighted solution. The longer you wait to do something, the larger that something becomes, and the larger it becomes the more stress you will be inviting into your life. Taking care of something as soon as we receive it is a great way to prevent stress, but it is something that takes great discipline to do. The more you cut Procrastination out of your life, the more stress free you will be. So shut that door, you're letting all the cold air out.<br/><br/>So let's review: Exercise, Write down what is stressing you, and Do not Procrastinate. These are only a few ways to relieve stress but to me, they are the most effective. While I know these may not work for everyone I would like to invite anyone feeling stressed to research how to get rid of it. | BLOGI<br/><br/>Iepazīstieties ar mūsu kolēģu rakstīto blogu kolekciju.<br/><br/>INFORMĀCIJAS BLOGS<br/><br/>Neuztraucieties par to<br/><br/>līdz<br/>Kristen Hogan<br/>Ķīpsalas iela 8, Rīga, LV-1048<br/><br/>Stress, neatkarīgi no tā, cik lielas lietas notiek, tas vienmēr var atrast veidu, kā aizmugurē savu neglīts galvu. Vai tas ir pēdējā brīža darba pieprasījumu vai papīra, ka jūs aizmirsāt rakstīt, un tas ir saistīts ar nākamo dienu, stress vienmēr var atrast ceļu uz savu dienu, ja jūs atļaujat to. Šodien es jums parādīšu dažas lietas, ko jūs varat darīt, lai novērstu vai novērstu stresu.<br/><br/>Pirmā lieta, ko jūs varat darīt, ir izmantot. Vingrošana ir lielisks veids, kā mazināt stresu, jo tas pazemina stresa hormonu organismā, kas pazīstams kā kortizola. Zemāks kortizola līmenis organismā, jo zemāks būs jūsu stresa līmenis. Exercise var arī palielināt savu uzticību, un, kad jūsu uzticība ir uz augšu, tad jūsu stress parasti ir uz leju. Man, kad es saņemu stresu, es vienmēr izmantoju, dodoties uz sporta zāli un praktizēt boksu, tas palīdz man sadedzināt kalorijas un samazināt stresu, vienlaikus jautri.<br/><br/>Rakstot lietas uz leju, ir bijis veids, kā nomierināt cilvēkus uz leju ļoti ilgu laiku, un tas ir nākamais temats mūsu sarakstā. Pierakstot to, kas ir padarīt jūs uzsvēra, ir veids, kā notīrīt prātu, un tas palīdz atbrīvoties no stresa, kā arī. Man ir līdzīga pieredze, rakstot stāstus, parasti, ja es nevaru iedomāties jaunu ideju vecā dēļ, es uzrakstīšu veco ideju un domāju par to. Tas ir, kad sāk parādīties jaunas idejas, un es varu turpināt rakstīt normāli. Tas pats ir ar stresu. Padomājiet par straumi, kas turpina plūst pa ceļu, līdz tas nonāk bebru aizsprostā, un šis aizsprosts bloķē ūdens plūsmu, un viss sāk veidoties. Vienīgais veids, kā iegūt ūdens plūsmu atpakaļ normālā stāvoklī, ir noņemt dambi. Tā ir vieta, kur notiek rakstīšana. Kad jūs to pierakstāt, jūs noņemat stresa gabalu pa gabaliem, līdz jūs atkal varat normāli domāt.<br/><br/>Stress var ienākt mūsu dzīvē caur durvīm mūsu dzīvē, ka mēs paturam atvērtas. Procrastination ir veids, kā mēs varam atstāt durvis atvērtas stresam. Gaidīšana līdz rītdienai var būt jautra šodienai, bet tā jums kaitēs rīt, un tas ir ļoti tuvredzīgs risinājums. Jo ilgāk jūs gaidāt kaut ko darīt, jo lielāks tas kļūst, un jo lielāks tas kļūst, jo vairāk stresa jūs uzaicināsit savā dzīvē. Rūpējoties par kaut ko, tiklīdz mēs to saņemam, ir lielisks veids, kā novērst stresu, bet tas ir kaut kas, kas aizņem lielu disciplīnu darīt. Jo vairāk jūs samazināt Procrastination no savas dzīves, vairāk stresa bezmaksas jums būs. Aizverot tās durvis, tu izlaiž ārā visu auksto gaisu.<br/><br/>Tātad, pieņemsim pārskatīt: Exercise, Pierakstiet to, kas jūs uzsver, un Vai nav vilcināties. Tie ir tikai daži veidi, kā mazināt stresu, bet man tie ir visefektīvākie. Lai gan es zinu, ka tie var nedarboties ikvienam, es vēlētos uzaicināt ikvienu, kas jūtas uzsvērts, lai izpētītu, kā no tā atbrīvoties. |
