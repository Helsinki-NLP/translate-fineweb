| Truly Handsfree Bluetooth Headset Takes Voice Commands<br/><br/>Most Bluetooth headsets are perfectly capable of the voice dial thing, assuming that the connected mobile phone can do it, but the BlueAnt V1 takes voice control to a new high. The incredibly compact Bluetooth headset is being marketed as the first ever with a true voice-based user interface.<br/><br/>Instead of clicking a physical button to answer your calls, you simply speak into the microphone and say "accept call". Other basic voice commands could include "volume up", "reject call", or "do the laundry". Okay, maybe it won't do that last thing, but you can see how a completely handsfree experience like that offered by the BlueAnt V1 can be excellent for drivers and other people who need their hands. That is why you're using a Bluetooth headset in the first place.<br/><br/>The downside is that the voice control can be "wonky" and it can be quite frustrating when you accidentally give it a command that you don't want it to do. What happens if you're in a call with someone and you happens to say "end call"? | Patiesi brīvroku Bluetooth austiņas aizņem balss komandas<br/><br/>Lielākā daļa Bluetooth austiņu ir pilnīgi spējīgas balss zvana lietai, pieņemot, ka pievienotais mobilais tālrunis to var izdarīt, bet BlueAnt V1 uztver balss vadību jaunā augstā. Neticami kompaktās Bluetooth austiņas tiek tirgotas kā pirmās ar patiesu balss lietotāja saskarni.<br/><br/>Tā vietā, lai noklikšķinātu uz fiziskas pogas, lai atbildētu uz jūsu zvaniem, jūs vienkārši runājat mikrofonā un sakāt "pieņemt zvanu". Citas pamata balss komandas varētu ietvert "sējumu uz augšu", "noraidīt zvanu" vai "veikt veļu". Labi, varbūt tas nedarīs to pēdējo, bet jūs varat redzēt, kā pilnīgi brīvroku pieredze, ko piedāvā BlueAnt V1, var būt lieliska autovadītājiem un citiem cilvēkiem, kuriem ir vajadzīgas viņu rokas. Tas ir iemesls, kāpēc jūs izmantojat Bluetooth austiņas pirmajā vietā.<br/><br/>Negatīvie ir tas, ka balss vadība var būt "nevēlams", un tas var būt diezgan nomākta, ja jūs nejauši tai komandu, ka jūs nevēlaties to darīt.

| Wednesday, July 06, 2005<br/><br/>Going to college? DREAM on<br/><br/>Here is another great article about our failing (and increasingly ridiculous) immigration system, this time from the Boston Globe. A 18-year undocumented immigrant from Massachusetts was awarded a four-year scholarship at any state university because of her high test scores, but this was later rescinded once state officials found out about her immigration status. As the author of the article so rightly says,<br/><br/>"So much for celebrating the building blocks for success and the American dream. Romney says, tough luck if you are smart, hardworking, and the child of illegal immigrants."<br/><br/>It's beyond me why anyone wants to keep smart, high-achieving kids like this one out of college. Does anybody really think that denying in-state tuition and scholarships to undocumented immigrants will make any potential immigrants think twice about coming here to work? Or are policies like these motivated by fear? Despite the increasingly widespread movement in favor of the DREAM Act and state laws (see this previous post) to allow undocumented students to pay in-state tuition, it seems like the power of fear is growing.<br/><br/>It's interesting that Mass. Gov. Romney is bashing undocumented immigrants now - this article in the Economist shows how his campaign to end gay marriage in Massachusetts is closely linked to his anticipated run for the presidency in 2008. Here in New York, presumed Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton has gone to the right on immigration, claiming that she is "adamantly against illegal immigrants." It's unfortunate that the way to get ahead in politics (particularly in the red states) is to blame immigrants for our problems. It will be interesting to see if an increased Latino turnout in places like the Southwest will prove Hillary wrong.<br/><br/>3 comments:<br/><br/>Maybe people do not want illegal aliens to get scholarhips for the following reasons:<br/><br/>1. Their parents violated the law to enter the country. 2. Their parents had to steal someone's identity to work in this country. 3. Their parents have to cheat on their income taxes (and other taxes) to stay here. 4. Their parents had to lie to get their children admitted. 5. their parents lied on applications for things like free lunch.<br/><br/>First, the Supreme Court ruled in 1982 that all children have the right to public education regardless of immigration status. Schools are prohibited from asking about a child's immigration status, meaning that undocumented parents do not have to "lie" to get their kids free lunch.<br/><br/>Second, many immigrants do not have to use another identity or cheat on income taxes in order to work here -- many employers knowingly hire undocumented immigrants (this has been happening for some time - the 1986 Imm. Reform and Control Act's attempted to deal with it, and many anti-immigrant advocates argue that employer sanctions need to be strengthened today) and quite a few immigrants pay income taxes and other taxes that they never end up receiving the benefits of (the New York Times reported that illegal immigrants provide social security with a subsidy of $7 billion a year).<br/><br/>Finally, if the biggest problem with undocumented immigrants is that they are breaking the law by being here, should that same standard be applied to businesses that knowingly hire them (which, by the way, is also against the law even though it is rarely enforced)? Should the kids of these businesspeople be denied the same opportunities because their parents broke the law? Could we extend this argument to the children of everyone who has ever broken the law in this country?<br/><br/>Whatever you think about illegal immigration, the point is that the kids should not be punished for their parents' decisions to come here. Especially when these bright and hardworking undocumented students have the potential to contribute so much to our society. | trešdiena, 2011. gada 7. jūlijs<br/><br/>Doties uz koledžu? sapnis par<br/><br/>Šeit ir vēl viens lielisks raksts par mūsu neveiksmīgo (un arvien smieklīgāko) imigrācijas sistēmu, šoreiz no Boston Globe. 18 gadu nedokumentētu imigrants no Masačūsetsas tika piešķirta četru gadu stipendiju jebkurā valsts universitātē, jo viņas augsto testu rezultātus, bet tas tika vēlāk atcelts, kad valsts amatpersonas uzzināja par viņas imigrācijas statusu. Kā autors raksta tik pareizi saka,<br/><br/>"Tik daudz, lai svinētu celtniecības blokus panākumiem un amerikāņu sapni. Romnijs saka, grūts veiksmi, ja esat gudrs, strādīgs un nelegālo imigrantu bērns."<br/><br/>Tas ir ārpus manis, kāpēc kāds vēlas saglabāt gudrus, augstas sasniegšanas bērnus, piemēram, šo vienu ārpus koledžas. Vai kāds tiešām domā, ka, liedzot valsts mācību un stipendijas imigrantiem bez dokumentiem, potenciālie imigranti divreiz domās par ierašanos darbā? Vai arī šāda politika ir baiļu motivēta? Neskatoties uz arvien plašāk izplatīto kustību par labu DREAM likumam un valsts likumiem (sk. šo iepriekšējo amatu), lai ļautu nereģistrētiem studentiem maksāt valsts mācības, šķiet, ka bailes spēks pieaug.<br/><br/>Tas ir interesanti, ka Mass. Gov. Romney ir bashing nedokumentētus imigrantus tagad - šis raksts žurnālā parāda, kā viņa kampaņa izbeigt geju laulības Masačūsetsā ir cieši saistīta ar viņa gaidāmo palaist prezidentūrai 2008. Tāpēc, lai izvairītos no pārpratumiem un nepatikšanām, ir svarīgi zināt, kā rīkoties šādās situācijās. Diemžēl veids, kā virzīties uz priekšu politikā (īpaši sarkanajās valstīs), ir vainot imigrantus par mūsu problēmām. Būs interesanti redzēt, vai pieaugošā Latino aktivitāte tādās vietās kā Dienvidrietumi izrādīsies Hilarija nepareiza.<br/><br/>3 komentāri:<br/><br/>Varbūt cilvēki nevēlas, lai nelegālie ārvalstnieki saņemtu scholarhips šādu iemeslu dēļ:<br/><br/>1. Viņu vecāki pārkāpa likumu, lai ieceļotu valstī. 2. Viņu vecākiem bija jānozog kāda identitāte, lai strādātu šajā valstī. 3. Viņu vecākiem ir jāapkrāpj viņu ienākuma nodokļi (un citi nodokļi), lai paliktu šeit. 4. Viņu vecākiem bija jāmelo, lai viņu bērni tiktu uzņemti. 5. viņu vecāki meloja par pieteikumiem tādām lietām kā bezmaksas pusdienas.<br/><br/>Pirmkārt, 1982. gadā Augstākā tiesa lēma, ka visiem bērniem ir tiesības uz valsts izglītību neatkarīgi no imigrācijas statusa. Skolām ir aizliegts jautāt par bērna imigrācijas statusu, kas nozīmē, ka nereģistrētiem vecākiem nav "gulēt", lai saņemtu saviem bērniem bezmaksas pusdienas.<br/><br/>Otrkārt, lai šeit strādātu, daudziem imigrantiem nav jāizmanto cita identitāte vai jāapkrāpj ienākuma nodokļi. Daudzi darba devēji apzināti pieņem darbā imigrantus bez dokumentiem (tas notiek jau kādu laiku - 1986. gadā. Reformas un kontroles likuma mēģinājums to risināt, un daudzi pret imigrantiem vērsti aizstāvji apgalvo, ka mūsdienās ir jāpastiprina darba devēju sankcijas), un diezgan maz imigrantu maksā ienākuma nodokļus un citus nodokļus, ko viņi nekad nesaņem (New York Times ziņoja, ka nelegālie imigranti nodrošina sociālo nodrošinājumu ar subsīdiju 7 miljardu ASV dolāru apmērā gadā).<br/><br/>Visbeidzot, ja lielākā problēma ar nedokumentētiem imigrantiem ir tā, ka viņi pārkāpj likumu, atrodoties šeit, vai tas pats standarts būtu jāpiemēro uzņēmumiem, kas tos apzināti pieņem darbā (kas, starp citu, arī ir pret likumu, lai gan to reti piemēro)? Vai šo uzņēmēju bērniem vajadzētu liegt tādas pašas iespējas, jo viņu vecāki pārkāpa likumu? Vai mēs varētu attiecināt šo argumentu uz visu to bērnu bērniem, kuri kādreiz ir pārkāpuši likumu šajā valstī?<br/><br/>Lai ko jūs domātu par nelegālo imigrāciju, jautājums ir par to, ka bērnus nedrīkst sodīt par viņu vecāku lēmumu ierasties šeit. Jo īpaši, ja šiem spilgtajiem un strādīgajiem studentiem ir potenciāls dot tik daudz ieguldījumu mūsu sabiedrībā. |

| ΑΛΗΘΩΣ<br/><br/>Corporations are not people and money is not speech<br/><br/>In Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned century-old restrictions on corporate spending in elections under the guise of protecting First Amendment free speech rights. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, writing for the majority, said, "If the First Amendment has any force, it prohibits Congress from fining or jailing citizens, or associations of citizens, for simply engaging in political speech." This argument of the majority decision rests on the notions that corporations are covered by the same free speech protections as individual citizens and that campaign donations or financing are the same as speech.<br/><br/>Corporations, however, are inherently not the same as individuals and thus cannot have the same protections as individuals. There are a slew of laws that protect corporations and their interests in the arena for which they are by definition formed—namely the marketplace. The laws that govern corporations and the rights enjoyed by them are distinct from the laws and rights of individuals. A corporation, for example, can enter into contracts like an individual, but unlike an individual, a corporation's members can be protected by limited liability so their personal assets are not at stake.<br/><br/>If a corporation, then, is a distinct legal entity governed by different laws than an individual is, corporations are not protected under the First Amendment in the same way that individuals are protected. Corporations, especially in their most powerful and wealthy incarnations, are exponentially more influential than most individuals in America. The restrictions on corporate spending in elections that were overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court were meant to redress this power balance between average individuals and unduly influential businesses. Corporations already have a plethora of ways to influence politics, from political action committees to lobbyists on Capitol Hill. The framers of the Bill of Rights wanted to protect the voices of the trampled, not amplify the voices of the elite.<br/><br/>The other part of the Supreme Court's premise for its decision is that the First Amendment free speech clause applies to campaign funding. While speech can be interpreted loosely as any form of expression, such an open, ambiguous definition would create a myriad of problems with all kinds of laws. An architect has a vision of a building: it is his art, his self expression, yet he cannot ignore local zoning laws that, for instance, restrict the height of his building. Should he sue the state for violation of his free speech, his right to expression? Equating money with speech also opens the door to sundry ludicrous claims by, for instance, an employer who objects to minimum wage laws since he'd like to express that his employees are only worth paying $3 an hour. There have to be restrictions on what constitutes speech to prevent a bastardization of the term and an overly liberal interpretation of the First Amendment.<br/><br/>A corporation already has the power to issue a statement in favor of a candidate or policy through its political action committees, and individual members of a business are welcome to contribute money as well. However, allowing a corporation to use its vast profits to directly finance the election or to remove a candidate compromises the democratic notion of a free and fair election. There are unseemly ties even now between politicians and various industries, but this new ruling would make such connections more robust and give them a veneer of legitimacy. A politician financed by a business would become completely beholden to its political agenda and not to the voters.<br/><br/>It's not only the independence of politicians that's at stake, but also the independence of our judges, who are at the very least expected to be impartial. Many states still use elections to appoint judges, which leaves them vulnerable to the influence of political spending. In a recent speech at a law school conference, former Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor worried about the impact of corporate campaign funding in judicial elections, saying that "judicial campaigning makes last week's decision in Citizens United an increasing problem for maintaining an independent judiciary."<br/><br/>Two cornerstones of our democracy—free elections and an independent judiciary—are threatened by the Supreme Court's activist and meddling decision. The case could have been decided much more narrowly in favor of Citizens United, but instead, the majority of the justices decided to expand the case to champion the rights of big money over the interest of the American people. Senators Dick Durbin (D-IL) and Arlen Specter (D-PA) introduced the Fair Elections Now Act last March. It would prohibit contributions from political action committees and would match individual donations, limited to $100, on a 4:1 basis so that fundraising focuses on the people. Such a system has been in place in New York City since the 1988 Campaign Finance Act. The rest of the country is long overdue to follow. Never before has the fight for public financing been more necessary.<br/><br/>The author is a Columbia College junior majoring in political science. She is a prospective law student.<br/><br/>The 14th amendment, which was one of the Reconstruction amendments added following the War of Northern Aggression was never legally ratified by the States and has caused more problems than all the other post-war amendments combined. If my memory serves me right, corporations were declared by the Supreme Court to be 14th Amemdment citizens during the late 1800s or early 1900s. In case you are unfamiliar with the wording of this amendment, it basically made everyone a citizen (and subject) of the United States. Prior to the War, all individuals were citizens of the State within which they resided and no one was a citizen of the United States nor were they subject to the jurisdiction of the United States except for those who resided in the District of Columbia or resided within one of the territories under the jurisdiction of the United States. The main purposes of the War of Northern Aggression was to destroy the soverienty of the individual States and reduce the status of every American to that of a subject under the control and jurisdiction of the United States government. The founding fathers set up our government as a loose confederation of Sovereign States with the States exercising all meaningful polical power. They never invisioned or intended any effective political power to reside in Washington. Things will only get much worse until We the People throw the theives and money changers out of Washington and restore our government back to what it once was.<br/><br/>The word person means corporation in law. It is not that corporations are not people, it is that people are not corporations. We have been tricked into accepting a corporate identity[ALL CAPS]. Look at your drivers license. Every time we go to court,we go as a corporation, not as a natural person.The first corporations were governments. Looked at logically, limited liability for a corporation is the extension of sovereign immunity to the king after he was no longer king. The same ruling elite families are still in control and that goes all the way back to the first known about extraterrestrials[anunaki] that the Sumerian documents talk about.The same group also take the credit or blame for all the religions and secret societies.<br/><br/>What difference does it make? Really. Think about it, the whole entire Congress and Senate are a dog and pony show, the real power brokers who control it all are in the shadows, working the deals, doing what they want, with the AL-CIA-DA and MOSSAD out there killing everyone who disagrees with these shadow government assholes who truly run it all.<br/><br/>So, why is it so important now to be so upset over this shit? Why now? After more than two hundred years of absolute proof that the politicians are just a fancy hand puppet show to distract us from the REAL WHEELING AND DEALING IN THE BACK ROOMS elsewhere, why does it matter now that the total contempt of democracy is being demonstrated by SCOTUS in this ruling? The assholes on this court know that the real guys with their hands on the power levers of the system aren't in the Congress and the Senate.<br/><br/>When the Rule of Law became OBSOLETE in the world, in general, and everything became more or less ROLLERBALL only this time, on STEROIDS, for and by the CORPORATIONS, why did this sole ruling make all that much difference? Why do all of you assholes think that this 'lagging' indicator of the end of any semblances of democratic government makes any difference.<br/><br/>Hypothetically, let's say this ruling had not happened. Do any of you think that the corporations and the moneyed influences in the shadows wouldn't have continued to exert any and all of their will on the rest of us?<br/><br/>For those of you who think it'd been different, I suggest you find a remedy to your TOTAL NAIVETE!!!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>this ruling didn't make one iota of a difference. It was always like this, long before SCOTUS basically said to corporations; "go ahead, do what the fuck you want…the little people are just cannon fodder for your wars, chattel for you to barter and sell at your leisure.."<br/><br/>democracy was always an illusion. We never ever had any control, ever. making such a mountain out of this mole hill is absolutely unwarranted, in light of the fact that for the whole entire 230 year history of this republic, the fat cats and the rich oligarchs never needed any Congress or Senate to do what they pleased, under any circumstances, ever. They just did it.<br/><br/>The government you were looking at was a chimera, not real..<br/><br/>the sooner you all come to that realization, the sooner we can get on with less pissing and moaning over a mere joke of a technicality that was always the case from day one, and was not foisted on us by the SCOTUS, the court only quite belatedly declared to us what has been happening for a long long long, corrupt time.<br/><br/>I've got a mad crush on Exxon, and Exxon has one on me, wedding bells in the spring – a bit quick I know, but our love can't be denied. Exxon is a little shy, so don't expect any public announcements, we're thinking a quiet wedding in Reno.<br/><br/>Any business is simply a group of individuals (small or large) exercising their individual rights collectively. Therefore, any business has the same rights as those individuals (except, of course, the right to vote, which is reserved to the individuals themselves). The freedom to dispose of one's wealth as one sees fit comes along with the freedom to earn it. If an aggregate of individuals has earned money, it should be free to decide how do dispose of that money. The real problem is not that businesses can donate to campaigns, it is that the government has been allowed to meddle in business – i.e. that the government can grant some favor in return for that money. We need separation of commerce and state in the same way and for the same reasons as we have separation of church and state. I also find it interesting that the author chose as examples two laws (zoning and minimum wage) that also violate individual rights. The first violates property rights and the second violates the rights of individuals to contract freely.<br/><br/>under your jackoffian analysis, nobody should interfere with anything anyone does at all. say, if I were in a crowd, with a saturday night special, and I want to 'free speech' your butt with it much in the same way the CIA free speeched Bobby Kennedy in L.A. one night, that's fine, because to interfere with me is interfering with my right to free speech you.<br/><br/>that's the critical flaw with you libertarian assholes….you think that there is no societal role for any rule of law, that anything that fits under 'ends justify means' rationale shouldn't ever be interfered with, just let everyone do whatever they so choose, and it all works out. That Ayn Rand bullshit doesn't work, dude! It works right up to the point where someone else pays a price for your 'whatever i wanna do' freedom crosses a line and then interfere with my freedom.<br/><br/>rules and laws SHOULD exist in the framework of society strictly to keep in check that good old "I can do anything I want to and it's just me being free" line of horse shit.<br/><br/>Corporations do not have any rights, dorkus! globally, they have been the reason why there are so many failed states, pillaged by the will of corporatocrats based in the U.S.S.A. who think that freedom of their speech translates into; "do what we tell you or we'll bomb you to get your resources we need" kind of raping and pillaging.<br/><br/>someday, I hope some asshole fucks you with their 'free speech' and then we'll hear your sorry ass whine about how the law let you down. What law? In your libertarian world of 'I can do what I want', the only rule of law is the one you make up to justify your end goal. For you then, it'll be fun to see how you cope with some other asshole's interpretation of your boundary being just a little bit of a mere inconvenience for his goals, which didn't necessarily respect your boundaries at all, for damned sure!<br/><br/>Someone by the name of "uh huh, right.." might have a logical point hidden in the forest of name-calling and straw-man abuse, but how about this: Corporations are inventions of the State that are created to pass some of the risks of doing business from the people running the business over to the stockholders (if any), the customers (if any) and the public. So if a corporation commits a fraud, it is the corporation that's punished (usually) and fined and the people who run the corporation get to walk away with a golden handshake. And the cost of the fine is passed along to the customers and paid to the government (not the victims!). To "David"s point, if we were to separate government and commerce, corporations would cease to exist! Not a bad idea.<br/><br/>I think that the point is, that if a corporation commits a financial crime, and nobody notices (the if the tree falls in the forest and nobody hears it, did it truly make a noise argument) then did a crime actually take place?<br/><br/>and in a veitch diagram, where the two blobs collide and interact, if one encroaches on the other one's boundary, who is the arbiter of who got violated?<br/><br/>my point is this: there are no straw man arguments with regard to david's asinine assessment that corporations can do whatever they want with abandon. the truth of the matter is, granting corporations, and oligarchs, or whomever, a license to do what they want, whenever they want, under the premise that THEY ARE INDIVIDUALS and hence, guaranteed FREE SPEECH, is both absurd and horse shit.<br/><br/>corporations are made up of groups of people. people who should live by some semblance of Rule of Law. When they don't have to, then it's "I can do anything I want as long as nobody catches me or holds me accountable for my transgressions" going on here.<br/><br/>if that's the world David wants to live in, let him go there and make it happen, but goddamn it, don't expect me not to fucking object to that shit!<br/><br/>We can all get along, just as long as boundaries are not gratuitously violated at will by anyone who thinks their right to do what they want actually nullifies my right not to be interfered with by their actions.<br/><br/>with regard to corporations, they have no right to violate my rights, or yours, or anyone elses. If they can't function in the community as a benevolent and hence, non interfering entity, then they have no right to exist.<br/><br/>and David wasn't being threatened. he's an asshole for asserting that "do what you want, it's freedom of speech" is a bunch of horse shit. It's la la land bullshit. And I object to anyone or anything violating my boundaries with that free speech assertion. That's a crock of shit and you know it is!<br/><br/>Well, that was a colorful response. Sadly, "uh-uh", you are way off the mark. I never said people have the right to infringe on anyone else's rights…and I repudiate "ends justify the means" thinking. Yes, laws SHOULD exist, but ONLY to PROTECT the rights of people. I'm sorry you have such a warped and horribly incorrect view of my argument.<br/><br/>your point well taken, David. I apologize for peeing in your corn flakes. I think I thought you were inferring that corporations were able to do whatever they pleased under this right of FREEDOM OF SPEECH, which in Amerk'a is a joke today because the PATRIOT ACT and a non-declared state of MARTIAL LAW we've been living under since Sept. 2001, has given the government the ability to suspend and or 'shred' the U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights.<br/><br/>sadly, people have only a few rights. we have the right to be taxed to the point of absurdity. we have the right to be conscripted and become cannon fodder for oligarch wars. and we have the right to shut the fuck up and be quiet while we are being joy boinked by corporations and oligarchs and bankers. those are our rights, and sadly, they truly SUCKETH, David. I think we can agree on that!<br/><br/>I'm still wondering how the newbie, Roberts, inherited the Chief Justiceship after Rhenquist rather than that role going to someone with more experience on the bench. What does "The Roberts Court" plan to do next, though, for corporations? Give them the right to vote at the polls like real people?; perhaps have votes by human beings counted as 3/5 of a person or less to their 1?<br/><br/>I haven't read all of the 183-page booklength "ruling" yet but find these appalling statements therein to be not only contradictory to their expansive actions in this case but also something of an abdication of their duty:<br/><br/>"the gravest and most delicate duty that this Court is called upon to perform." Blodgett v. Holden, 275 U. S. 142, 147–148 (1927) (Holmes, J., concurring). Because the stakes are so high, our standard practice is to refrain from addressing constitutional questions except when necessary to rule on particular claims before us. See Ashwander v. TVA, 297 U. S. 288, 346–348 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concur-ring). This policy underlies both our willingness to construe ambiguous statutes to avoid constitutional problems and our practice "'never to formulate a rule of constitutional law broader than is required by the precise facts to which it is to be applied.'" United States v. Raines, 362<br/>U. S. 17, 21 (1960) (quoting Liverpool, New York & Philadelphia S. S. Co. v. Commissioners of Emigration, 113<br/>U.

Ante, at 12; post, at 14 (STEVENS, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). >><br/><br/>Roberts, by virtue of his lies during CONfirmation by the DEMS who shoved his lying ass thru the process at mach speed, needs to be 'impeached' for being a fucking liar. He specifically stated he would not go this route of writing decisions not based on settled, non controversial concepts of the U.S. Constitution…and here clearly he has done exactly the opposite of that.<br/><br/>The real blame should be on the shoulders of the cocksuckers in the SENATE that confirmed the son of a bitch in the first place, stating they wouldn't vote against his confirmation because they were saving their ammo for REAL THREATS TO US..<br/><br/>I blame the fucking DINOCRATS more than I blame this lying pile of shit named Roberts. Pricks like SCHUMER and that other asshole from Illinois, and that lying zionist bastard Levin from Michigan. Just a couple of them holding their ground could have stopped the confirmation of Alito, and then Roberts. But they let it slide.<br/><br/>the assertion that all of this is indeed window dressing is a correct one, and the truth is, though blatantly a violation of our rights across the board, these scum in the SCOTUS are only post fact, asserting the screwing they were doing to us for a long, long, long time.<br/><br/>the truth is, it never mattered what we thought was going on, because Corporations have been functioning well outside the law for a long time now, and nobody has held them accountable. the very bastards that sit on the SCOTUS are benefactors of the wrongdoing and greed of the corporations who provide kickbacks to them for their decisions, in the form of STOCK DIVIDENDS.<br/><br/>unfortunately, focusing on the corrupt SCOTUS doesn't help us much. It's like stating the obvious, and expecting it to be punishable, when it is not.<br/><br/>we are fucked no matter how we look at it, but there will be a day of atonement. Once they take away every last vestige of personal dignity of the entire middle class in this country, there will be hell to pay. There will be a violent, bloody backlash the likes of which has only been seen in France, but eventually will come home to roost here.<br/><br/>Communists have long been in the business of fomenting class war along economic lines and brackets. Try to think more in terms of the Constitutionalist Class than the "middle class" as their linguists prefer. Works better, imo, to throw them off their gameplans.<br/><br/>what is happening now is a quickening in the realization by the Sheeple that something is seriously wrong, and that the facade and the illusion are wearing thin and falling down, revealing the ugly, multi tentacled ROTHSCHILD beast behind the corporatocracy push for more power and absolute rule.<br/><br/>as the 'middle class' or whatever you want to call it, gets increasingly decimated and destroyed, ultimately enough Sheeple will have awakened to the point where they realize it's either stand up and fight or die on all fours.<br/><br/>the system ROTHSCHILDS is collapsing in on itself, due to way too much out of control, unchecked GREED, and now, it's like a tall building going back and forth like a pendulum in an earthquake, at some point it will finally 'snap' and fall. we're in the end game, as you will, of democracy and the faux economic system that was being perpetrated upon everyone, so there's a collision with REALITY about to happen pretty soon, and it will not be pretty.<br/><br/>IF I were SCOTUS, I'd be making sure those biz jets are fueled, pilots standing by, for their final PARAGUAYAN trip to the Bush compound where they'll hide once the balloon finally goes up here.<br/><br/>but increasingly, it looks like they're pushing hard for World War III to take everyone's eyes off the mind blowing, incredible HUBRIS of their ilk.<br/><br/>a day of reckoning is indeed coming. And it will not be pretty.<br/><br/>Comment by what I think is happening now is this.. &#124;<br/>February 2, 2010<br/>&#124; Reply<br/><br/>I agree that the collapsing systems are theirs, not America's, and check out this link from Rense.com:<br/><br/>Looks kinda like the ugly, multi tentacled ROTHSCHILD beast behind the corporatocracy is trying to disguise itself as an offshore oil rig or something, doesn't it?<br/><br/>In their push for WWIII, they're also pushing for an insurrection here to throw out the Constitution in exasperation and contempt so that they can replace it with their own designs. Sounds like Treason to me.<br/><br/>In my own idea and understanding there have to be restrictions on what constitutes speech to prevent a bastardization of the term and an overly liberal interpretation of the First Amendment..Great post!!<br/><br/>4 We need not reach the question whether the Government has a compelling interest in preventing foreign individuals or associations from influencing our Nation's political process. Cf. 2 U. S. C. §441e (contribution and expenditure ban applied to "foreign national[s]"). Section 441b is not limited to corporations or associations that were created in foreign countries or funded predominantly by foreign shareholders. Section 441b therefore would be overbroad even if we assumed, arguendo, that the Government has a compelling interest in limiting foreign influence over our political process.

It is now in a yearly bankruptcy rollover. The government is now private like BLACKWATER. All government agencies are listed on DUNN AND BRADSTREET. The common law which the constitution specifies pertains to natural people. All business by the courts today is corporate meaning that we are viewed as individual corporations. We exist by contract with the state. Remember the 14th amendment. There were no US citizens before that. Most of us have unwittingly claimed US corporate citizenship. We need to address the rule by the banking elite.Almost all leading REPS and DEMS are members of the COUNCIL OF FOREIGN RELATIONS or the TLC. LOok up the history of who started and controls these. Rush, Glenn and Sean are all liars and banker bootlickers. Obama is a puppet for the CFR. 911 truth has a great deal more bearing and would serve to unite the honest people in this country.<br/><br/>I don't really believe I'm a corporation or the citizen of one but, if the gubbermint thinks so, does the SCOTUS ruling mean that there are no more campaign contribution limits on anyone, businesses or individuals? I'd rather see money removed from our electoral process altogether — equal time on America's airwaves given at no charge for all candidates | (LV)<br/><br/>Korporācijas nav cilvēki, un nauda nav runa.<br/><br/>ASV Augstākā tiesa atcēla gadsimtu vecos ierobežojumus korporatīvajiem izdevumiem vēlēšanās, aizbildinoties ar to, ka ir jāaizsargā pirmā labojuma vārda brīvības tiesības. Tiesnesis Entonijs Kenedijs (Anthony M. Kennedy), rakstot vairākuma vārdā, teica: "Ja Pirmajam labojumam ir kāds spēks, tas aizliedz Kongresam sodīt vai ieslodzīt pilsoņus vai pilsoņu apvienības vienkārši politiskas runas dēļ." Šis vairākuma lēmuma arguments balstās uz jēdzieniem, ka uz korporācijām attiecas tāda pati vārda brīvība kā uz atsevišķiem pilsoņiem un ka kampaņas ziedojumi vai finansējums ir tāds pats kā runa.<br/><br/>Tomēr korporācijas pēc būtības nav tādas pašas kā privātpersonas, un tādējādi tām nevar būt tāda pati aizsardzība kā privātpersonām. Ir virkne likumu, kas aizsargā korporācijas un to intereses arēnā, kurai tās pēc definīcijas ir izveidotas, proti, tirgū. Likumi, kas regulē korporācijas, un to tiesības ir atšķirīgas no indivīdu likumiem un tiesībām. Korporācija, piemēram, var noslēgt līgumus kā indivīds, bet atšķirībā no indivīda, korporācijas dalībnieki var aizsargāt ar ierobežotu atbildību, tāpēc viņu personīgie aktīvi nav apdraudēta.<br/><br/>Ja korporācija ir atsevišķa juridiska persona, ko regulē citi likumi, nevis fiziska persona, korporācija nav aizsargāta saskaņā ar pirmo grozījumu tādā pašā veidā, ka indivīdi ir aizsargāti. Korporācijas, īpaši to varenākajās un bagātākajās inkarnācijās, ir eksponenciāli ietekmīgākas nekā vairums indivīdu Amerikā. ASV Augstākās tiesas atceltie ierobežojumi attiecībā uz uzņēmumu izdevumiem vēlēšanās bija paredzēti, lai atjaunotu šo varas līdzsvaru starp vidusmēra indivīdiem un pārmērīgi ietekmīgiem uzņēmumiem. Korporācijām jau ir daudz veidu, kā ietekmēt politiku, sākot no politiskās rīcības komitejām līdz lobistiem Kapitolija kalnā. Tiesību likumprojekta veidotāji vēlējās aizsargāt samīdītās balsis, nepalielinot elites balsis.<br/><br/>Otra daļa no Augstākās tiesas priekšnoteikumu tās lēmums ir tas, ka pirmais grozījums vārda brīvība attiecas uz kampaņu finansēšanu. Lai gan runu var interpretēt brīvi kā jebkuru izteiksmes veidu, šāda atvērta, neskaidra definīcija radītu neskaitāmas problēmas ar visu veidu likumiem. Arhitektam ir vīzija par ēku: tā ir viņa māksla, viņa pašizpausme, taču viņš nevar ignorēt vietējos zonējuma likumus, kas, piemēram, ierobežo viņa ēkas augstumu. Vai viņam jāiesūdz valsts par savas vārda brīvības un tiesību uz izteikšanos pārkāpšanu? Pielīdzināt naudu ar runu arī paver durvis, lai dažādi smieklīgs prasības, piemēram, darba devējs, kas iebilst pret minimālās algas likumu, jo viņš gribētu izteikt, ka viņa darbinieki ir tikai vērts maksāt $ 3 stundā. Ir jābūt ierobežojumiem attiecībā uz to, kas ir runa, lai novērstu apzīmējuma bastardizāciju un pārāk liberālu Pirmā labojuma interpretāciju.<br/><br/>Kapitālsabiedrībai jau ir tiesības izdot paziņojumu par labu kandidātam vai politikai, izmantojot politiskās rīcības komitejas, un individuālie uzņēmuma locekļi ir laipni aicināti ieguldīt naudu, kā arī. Tomēr, ļaujot korporācijai izmantot tās milzīgo peļņu, lai tieši finansētu vēlēšanas vai atceltu kandidātu, tiek kompromitēts demokrātiskais priekšstats par brīvām un godīgām vēlēšanām. Jau tagad starp politiķiem un dažādām nozarēm pastāv nevajadzīgas saiknes, bet šis jaunais lēmums padarītu šādas saiknes stabilākas un piešķirtu tām leģitimitāti. Politiķis, ko finansē kāds uzņēmums, pilnībā ņemtu vērā tā politisko darba kārtību, nevis vēlētājus.<br/><br/>Uz spēles ir ne tikai politiķu neatkarība, bet arī mūsu tiesnešu neatkarība, no kuriem vismaz tiek sagaidīta neitralitāte. Daudzas valstis joprojām izmanto vēlēšanas, lai ieceltu tiesnešus, kas padara viņus neaizsargātus pret politisko izdevumu ietekmi. Bijusī Augstākās tiesas tiesnese Sandra Day O'Connor nesen teica runu tiesību zinātņu skolas konferencē, kurā pauda bažas par korporatīvo kampaņu finansēšanas ietekmi uz tiesnešu vēlēšanām, sakot, ka "tiesu kampaņas padara pagājušajā nedēļā pieņemto lēmumu pilsoņu savienībā par arvien lielāku problēmu, lai saglabātu neatkarīgu tiesu varu."<br/><br/>Augstākās tiesas aktīvists un jauktais lēmums apdraud divus mūsu demokrātijas stūrakmeņus – brīvas vēlēšanas un neatkarīgu tiesu varu. Lieta varēja tikt izlemta daudz šaurāk par labu Citizens United, bet tā vietā lielākā daļa tiesu nolēma paplašināt lietu, lai aizstāvētu lielas naudas tiesības pār amerikāņu iedzīvotāju interesēm. Senatori Dick Durbin (D-IL) un Arlen Spekter (D-PA) pagājušā gada martā ieviesa Fair vēlēšanas Tagad akts. Tas aizliegtu politiskās rīcības komiteju iemaksas un atbilstu individuāliem ziedojumiem, kas nepārsniedz 100 ASV dolārus, pamatojoties uz 4:1, lai līdzekļu vākšana būtu vērsta uz cilvēkiem. Šāda sistēma ir spēkā Ņujorkā kopš 1988. gada kampaņas finanšu likums. Pārējā valsts ir jau sen jāievēro. Nekad agrāk cīņa par valsts finansējumu nav bijusi nepieciešama.<br/><br/>Autors ir Kolumbijas koledžas jaunākais, kas specializējies politikas zinātnē. Viņa ir potenciālais tiesību zinātņu students.<br/><br/>14. grozījumu, kas bija viens no pēc Ziemeļu kara pievienotajiem rekonstrukcijas grozījumiem, valstis juridiski neratificēja, un tas ir radījis vairāk problēmu nekā visi pārējie pēckara grozījumi kopā. Ja mana atmiņa kalpo man labi, korporācijām tika paziņots, ka Augstākā tiesa ir 14 Amemdment pilsoņi vēlu 1800s vai agri 1900s laikā. Gadījumā, ja jūs nepārzināt šī grozījuma formulējumu, tas būtībā padarīja ikvienu par Amerikas Savienoto Valstu pilsoni (un subjektu). Pirms kara visas personas bija tās valsts pilsoņi, kurā viņi dzīvoja, un neviens nebija Amerikas Savienoto Valstu pilsonis, kā arī viņi nebija pakļauti Amerikas Savienoto Valstu jurisdikcijai, izņemot tos, kas dzīvoja Kolumbijas apgabalā vai dzīvoja vienā no teritorijām, kas atrodas Amerikas Savienoto Valstu jurisdikcijā. Ziemeļu agresijas kara galvenie mērķi bija iznīcināt atsevišķu štatu soverientiju un samazināt katra amerikāņu statusu līdz tādam priekšmetam, kas atrodas Amerikas Savienoto Valstu valdības kontrolē un jurisdikcijā. Dibinātāji izveidoja mūsu valdību kā vaļīgu Suverēno valstu konfederāciju ar valstīm, kurām ir visa jēgpilnā politiskā vara. Viņi nekad nav paredzējuši vai plānojuši nekādu efektīvu politisko varu dzīvot Vašingtonā. Lietas tikai kļūs daudz sliktākas, līdz mēs, cilvēki, izmetīsim idejas un naudas mijējus no Vašingtonas un atjaunosim mūsu valdību atpakaļ uz to, kas tā reiz bija.<br/><br/>Vārds persona nozīmē korporāciju. Nav tā, ka korporācijas nav cilvēki, tas ir, ka cilvēki nav korporācijas. Mēs esam apmānīti, pieņemot korporatīvo identitāti [ALL CAPS]. Paskaties uz jūsu vadītāja apliecību. Katru reizi, kad mēs ejam uz tiesu,mēs ejam kā korporācija, nevis kā fiziska persona. Pirmās korporācijas bija valdības. Looked loģiski, ierobežota atbildība par korporāciju ir pagarināt suverēno imunitāti pret karali pēc tam, kad viņš vairs nebija karalis. Tās pašas valdošās elites ģimenes joprojām kontrolē un kas iet visu ceļu atpakaļ uz pirmo zināmo par citplanētām[anunaki], par kurām runā šumeru dokumenti. Tā pati grupa arī ņem kredītu vai vainu par visām reliģijām un slepenām sabiedrībām.<br/><br/>Kāda ir atšķirība? Padomājiet par to, viss Kongress un Senāts ir suns un poniju šovs, reālās varas brokeri, kas to visu kontrolē, atrodas ēnās, strādā darījumus, dara to, ko viņi vēlas, ar AL-CIA-DA un MOSSAD, kas tur nogalina ikvienu, kurš nepiekrīt šiem ēnu valdības pakaļas, kas patiešām to visu vada.<br/><br/>Tātad, kāpēc tas ir tik svarīgi, lai būtu tik sajukums pār šo sūdi? Kāpēc tagad? Pēc vairāk nekā divsimt gadu ilgiem absolūtiem pierādījumiem, ka politiķi ir tikai smalku roku leļļu šovs, lai novirzītu mūs no REĀLA RITEŅA UN TUVOŠANĀS ATPAKAĻ, kāpēc tagad ir svarīgi, ka SCOTUS šajā nolēmumā demonstrē pilnīgu demokrātijas nicinājumu? Sūdi šajā galmā zina, ka īstie puiši ar savām rokām uz sistēmas varas svirām nav nedz Kongresā, nedz Senātā.<br/><br/>Kad pasaulē vispār sāka valdīt tiesiskums, un viss vairāk vai mazāk kļuva rupjš tikai šoreiz, STEROĪDIEM, par un ar līdzībām, kāpēc šis vienīgais spriedums radīja tik daudz atšķirību? Kāpēc jūs visi, kretīni, domājat, ka šis "atpakaļgaitas” rādītājs, kas liecina par demokrātiskas valdības galu, kaut ko maina?<br/><br/>Hipotētiski, pieņemsim, ka šis lēmums nebija noticis. Vai kāds no jums domā, ka korporācijas un naudas ietekme ēnās nebūtu turpinājusi izrādīt jebkādu un visu savu gribu attiecībā uz mums pārējiem?<br/><br/>Tiem no jums, kas domā, ka tas bija atšķirīgs, es iesaku jums atrast līdzekli, lai jūsu KOPĀ NAIVETE !!!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>Šis lēmums neko nemainīja. Tas vienmēr bija kā šis, ilgi pirms SCOTUS būtībā teica korporācijām; "iet uz priekšu, darīt to, ko jūs vēlaties...mazie cilvēki ir tikai lielgabalu lopbarība jūsu kariem, chattel lai jūs varētu barter un pārdot jūsu atpūtai .."<br/><br/>demokrātija vienmēr bija ilūzija. Mums nekad nav bijusi nekāda kontrole. Šāda kalna vešana no kurmja kalna ir absolūti nepamatota, ņemot vērā to, ka visu šīs republikas 230 gadu vēsturi resnajiem kaķiem un bagātajiem oligarhiem nekad nav bijis vajadzīgs ne Kongress, ne Senāts, lai darītu to, kas viņiem labpatīk, nekādos apstākļos. Viņi to vienkārši izdarīja.<br/><br/>Valdība, uz kuru jūs skatījāties, bija himera, nevis īsta..<br/><br/>jo ātrāk jūs visi nonākat pie šīs apzināšanās, jo ātrāk mēs varēsim tikt galā ar mazāk pissing un moaning pār tikai joks par tehnisko, kas vienmēr bija gadījums no pirmās dienas, un nebija foisted uz mums ar SCOTUS, tiesa tikai diezgan novēloti paziņoja mums, kas ir noticis uz ilgu, ilgu, korumpēti laiku.<br/><br/>Es esmu sajūsmināts par Exxon, un Exxon ir viens uz mani, kāzu zvani pavasarī - mazliet ātri es zinu, bet mūsu mīlestību nevar noliegt. Exxon ir nedaudz kautrīgs, tāpēc negaidiet nekādus publiskus paziņojumus, mēs domājam par klusām kāzām Reno.<br/><br/>Jebkurš uzņēmums ir vienkārši personu grupa (maza vai liela), kas kolektīvi īsteno savas individuālās tiesības. Tāpēc jebkuram uzņēmumam ir tādas pašas tiesības kā šīm personām (izņemot, protams, balsstiesības, kas ir rezervētas pašām personām). Brīvība atbrīvoties no savas bagātības, kā to uzskata par piemērotu, nāk kopā ar brīvību to nopelnīt. Ja cilvēku kopums ir nopelnījis naudu, tam vajadzētu būt brīvai izvēlei, kā rīkoties ar šo naudu. Patiesā problēma nav tā, ka uzņēmumi var ziedot kampaņām, tas ir tas, ka valdībai ir atļauts jaukties biznesā, t.i., ka valdība var dot kādu labumu apmaiņā pret šo naudu. Mums ir nepieciešams nodalīt tirdzniecību un valsti tādā pašā veidā un tādu pašu iemeslu dēļ, kā mums ir nošķirt baznīcu un valsti. Man arī šķiet interesanti, ka autors izvēlējās kā piemērus divus likumus (zonēšanas un minimālo algu), kas arī pārkāpj individuālās tiesības. Pirmais pārkāpj īpašuma tiesības, bet otrais pārkāpj indivīdu tiesības brīvi slēgt līgumus.<br/><br/>saskaņā ar jūsu Jackoffian analīzi, nevienam nevajadzētu iejaukties ar kaut ko kāds vispār dara. teikt, ja es būtu pūlī, ar īpašu sestdienas vakaru, un es vēlos "brīvi runāt" jūsu muca ar to daudz tāpat kā CIP bezmaksas runas Bobby Kennedy LA vienu nakti, tas ir labi, jo iejaukties ar mani traucē manu tiesības uz vārda jums.<br/><br/>tas ir kritiskais trūkums ar jums libertāriskajiem kretīniem... jūs domājat, ka nevienam likumam nav sociālas lomas, ka viss, kas atbilst "galiem, attaisno līdzekļus", nekad nedrīkst būt traucēts, vienkārši ļaujiet ikvienam darīt visu, ko viņi izvēlas, un tas viss darbojas. Ka Ayn Rand bullshit nedarbojas, frants! Tas darbojas līdz vietai, kur kāds cits maksā cenu par jūsu "neatkarīgi es gribu darīt" brīvību šķērso līniju un pēc tam traucēt manu brīvību.<br/><br/>Noteikumi un likumi būtu pastāv sabiedrības ietvaros stingri, lai saglabātu pārbaudīt, ka vecais labais "Es varu darīt visu, ko es gribu, un tas ir tikai man ir bezmaksas" līnija zirgu sūdi.<br/><br/>Korporācijām nav nekādu tiesību, dorkus! globāli, tie ir bijuši iemesls, kāpēc tur ir tik daudz neizdevušās valstis, izlaupīja gribas corporatocrats, kas atrodas ASV. kuri domā, ka brīvība viņu runas tulkojumā; "darīt to, ko mēs jums pateiksim, vai mēs bumbu jums, lai saņemtu savus resursus, mums ir nepieciešams" veida izvarošanas un izlaupīšana.<br/><br/>Kādu dienu, es ceru, ka kāds kretīns tevi izdrāzīs ar savu "brīvo runu", un tad mēs dzirdēsim tavu atvainošanos par to, kā likums tevi pievīlis. Jūsu liberālajā pasaulē "es varu darīt to, ko gribu" vienīgais tiesiskums ir tas, ko jūs izveidojat, lai attaisnotu savu gala mērķi. Jums tad, tas būs jautri, lai redzētu, kā jums tikt galā ar kādu citu asshole interpretāciju jūsu robežas ir tikai mazliet tikai neērtības viņa mērķiem, kas nav obligāti ievērot jūsu robežas vispār, par sasodīti pārliecināts!<br/><br/>Kāds ar nosaukumu "uh huh, labi.." varētu būt loģisks punkts paslēptas meža nosaukumu aicinot un salmu cilvēks ļaunprātīgu izmantošanu, bet kā par to: korporācijas ir izgudrojumi valsts, kas ir radīti, lai nodot dažus no riskiem, veicot uzņēmējdarbību no cilvēkiem, kas darbojas pār akcionāriem (ja tādi ir), klientiem (ja tādi ir) un sabiedrībai. Tātad, ja korporācija veic krāpšanu, tā ir korporācija, kas ir sodīta (parasti) un sodīta, un cilvēki, kas vada korporāciju, var iet prom ar zelta rokasspiedienu. Un naudas soda izmaksas tiek nodotas klientiem un samaksātas valdībai (ne upuriem!). Uz "Dāvida" punktu, ja mēs nošķirtu valdību un komerciju, korporācijas vairs nepastāvētu! Nav slikta ideja.<br/><br/>Es domāju, ka lieta ir tāda, ka, ja korporācija izdara finanšu noziegumu, un neviens to nepamana (ja koks nokrīt mežā un neviens to nedzird, vai tas patiešām radīja trokšņa argumentu), tad vai noziegums faktiski notika?<br/><br/>un veitch diagrammā, kur divi blobs saduras un mijiedarbojas, ja viens aizskar uz otra robežas, kurš ir šķīrējtiesnesis, kurš tika pārkāptas?<br/><br/>Mans viedoklis ir šāds: attiecībā uz davida asinine novērtējumu nav nekādu argumentu, ka korporācijas var darīt, ko vien vēlas, pametot novārtā. patiesība ir tāda, ka, piešķirot korporācijas un oligarhus, vai jebkuru citu, licence darīt to, ko viņi vēlas, kad vien vēlas, saskaņā ar pieņēmumu, ka viņi ir individualitātes un tādējādi garantē brīvu izcelšanos, ir gan absurds, gan zirgu sūdi.<br/><br/>korporācijas sastāv no cilvēku grupām. cilvēki, kuriem vajadzētu dzīvot ar kaut ko līdzīgu tiesiskumam. Kad viņiem tas nav jādara, tad tas ir "Es varu darīt visu, ko vēlos, ja vien neviens mani nenoķer vai neliek man atbildēt par maniem pārkāpumiem", kas notiek šeit.<br/><br/>Ja tā ir pasaule, kurā Deivids vēlas dzīvot, lai viņš tur iet un dara to, bet, sasodīts, negaidiet, ka es neiebilstu pret to sūdu!<br/><br/>Mēs visi varam iztikt, ja vien robežas pēc vēlēšanās netiek bez maksas pārkāptas ikvienam, kurš domā, ka viņu tiesības darīt to, ko viņi vēlas, faktiski atceļ manas tiesības neiejaukties viņu darbībās.<br/><br/>attiecībā uz korporācijām, viņiem nav tiesību pārkāpt manas vai jūsu, vai citu tiesības. Ja viņi nevar darboties sabiedrībā kā labvēlīga un līdz ar to neiejaukšanās vienība, tad viņiem nav tiesību pastāvēt.<br/><br/>un Deivids netika apdraudēts. viņš ir kretīns, kas apgalvo, ka "darīt to, ko vēlaties, tā ir runas brīvība" ir ķekars zirgu sūdi. Tas ir la la land bullshit. Un es iebilstu pret ikvienu vai jebko, kas pārkāpj manas robežas ar šo runas brīvības apgalvojumu. Tas ir sūda gabals, un tu zini, ka tas ir!<br/><br/>Nu, tā bija krāsaina atbilde. Diemžēl, "uh-uh", jūs esat tālu no zīmes. Es nekad neesmu teicis, ka cilvēkiem ir tiesības pārkāpt citu tiesības... un es noraidu "galus attaisno līdzekļus" domāšanu. Jā, likumi pastāv, bet tikai, lai aizsargātu cilvēku tiesības. Man žēl, ka jums ir tik izkropļots un šausmīgi nepareizs viedoklis par manu argumentu.<br/><br/>Atvainojos par to, ka jūs čurājat kukurūzas plēksnēs. Es domāju, ka es domāju, ka jūs secināt, ka korporācijām bija iespēja darīt visu, ko viņi apmierināti saskaņā ar šīm tiesībām brīvību SPEECH, kas Amerk'a ir joks šodien, jo PATRIOT ACT un nedeklarētu valsts MARTIAL likums mēs esam dzīvo saskaņā ar kopš septembris 2001, ir devis valdībai iespēju apturēt un vai "sasmalcināt" ASV Konstitūcijas un Bill of Rights.<br/><br/>Diemžēl cilvēkiem ir tikai dažas tiesības. Mums ir tiesības tikt apliktiem ar nodokli līdz absurdam. Mums ir tiesības tikt iesauktiem un kļūt par lielgabalu barību oligarhu kariem. un mums ir tiesības klusēt, kamēr mūs sajūsmina korporācijas, oligarhi un baņķieri. tās ir mūsu tiesības, un diemžēl tās patiešām ir SUCKETH, Deivid.<br/><br/>Es joprojām domāju, kā jaunpienācējs, Roberts, mantoja galveno tiesu pēc Rhenquist, nevis šo lomu, lai dotos uz kādu ar lielāku pieredzi uz soliņa. Ko "Roberts Court" plāno darīt tālāk, lai gan, korporācijām? Dodiet viņiem tiesības balsot vēlēšanās kā reāliem cilvēkiem; varbūt cilvēki balso kā 3/5 no personas vai mazāk par viņu 1?<br/><br/>Es neesmu lasījis visu 183-page booklength "valdīšana", vēl bet atrast šos šausmīgs paziņojumus tajā ir ne tikai pretrunā ar savu ekspansīvo darbību šajā gadījumā, bet arī kaut ko noliegšana savu pienākumu:<br/><br/>Blodgett v. Holden, 275 U. S. 142, 147 – 148 (1927) (Holmes, J., concurring). Tā kā likmes ir tik augstas, mūsu standarta prakse ir atturēties no konstitucionālu jautājumu izskatīšanas, izņemot gadījumus, kad tas ir nepieciešams, lai lemtu par konkrētām prasībām pret mums. Skatīt Ashwander pret TVA, 297 U. S. 288, 346-348 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concur-ring). Šī politika ir pamatā gan mūsu vēlmei konstruēt neviennozīmīgus statūtus, lai izvairītos no konstitucionālajām problēmām, gan mūsu praksei "nekad nenoformulēt konstitucionālo tiesību normu plašāk, nekā to prasa precīzi fakti, uz kuriem tā ir attiecināma."

Viņš īpaši norādīja, ka viņš nebūtu iet šo ceļu rakstīšanas lēmumus, kas nav balstīta uz pastāvīgo, bezstrīdus koncepcijas ASV Konstitūcijas... un šeit skaidri viņš ir darījis tieši pretēju.<br/><br/>Patiesā vaina būtu jābūt uz pleciem cocksuckers, kas Senate, kas apstiprināja dēls kuce pirmajā vietā, norādot, ka viņi nebalsotu pret viņa apstiprinājumu, jo viņi bija ietaupīt savu munīciju par REAL THREATS uz mums ..<br/><br/>Es vainoju dinoktus vairāk, nekā es vainoju to sūdu kaudzi, vārdā Robertss. Tādi grēki kā SCHUMER un tas kretīns no Ilinoisas, un tas zionists bastards Levins no Mičiganas.

Mēģiniet domāt vairāk par konstitucionālistisko klasi nekā "vidusšķiru", jo viņu valodnieki dod priekšroku. Strādā labāk, imo, mest tos pie viņu gameplans.<br/><br/>Tas, kas šobrīd notiek, ir kā paātrinājums Sheeple apziņā, ka kaut kas ir nopietni nepareizi, un ka fasāde un ilūzija ir tievi un krītoši, atklājot neglīto, daudz taustāmo ROTHSCHILD zvēru aiz korporatokrātijas, kas tiecas pēc lielākas varas un absolūtas varas.<br/><br/>kā "vidusšķira" vai jebkas cits, ko jūs vēlaties to nosaukt, kļūst arvien masīvāks un iznīcināts, galu galā pietiekami daudz Sheeple būs pamodies līdz vietai, kur viņi saprot, ka tas ir vai nu piecelties un cīnīties vai mirt četrrāpus.<br/><br/>sistēma ROTHSCHILDS sabrūk pati no sevis, pārāk daudz nekontrolējamas, nekontrolētas GREED dēļ, un tagad tā ir kā augsta ēka, kas iet uz priekšu un atpakaļ kā svārsts zemestrīcē, kādā brīdī tas beidzot "snap" un samazināsies. mēs esam beigu spēlē, kā jūs vēlaties, demokrātijas un mākslīgās ekonomiskās sistēmas, kas tika izdarīta uz visiem, tāpēc tur ir sadursme ar REALITY gatavojas notikt diezgan drīz, un tas nebūs skaista.<br/><br/>Ja es būtu Skots, es būtu pārliecināts, ka šīs biz sprauslas tiek uzpildītas, piloti stāv blakus, par viņu pēdējo PARAGUAYAN ceļojumu uz Buša savienojumu, kur viņi slēpsies, kad balons beidzot iet uz augšu šeit.<br/><br/>bet arvien vairāk izskatās, ka viņi piespiež III Pasaules karam novērst ikviena acis no prāta, kas pūš, neticamo HUBRIS no viņu silka.<br/><br/>diena skaitīšanas ir patiešām nāk.

Sal. ar 2 U. C. 441e (iemaksu un izdevumu aizliegums, ko piemēro "ārvalstu pilsoņiem"). 441.b sadaļa neaprobežojas tikai ar sabiedrībām vai apvienībām, kas izveidotas ārvalstīs vai ko finansē galvenokārt ārvalstu akcionāri. Tāpēc 441.b pants būtu pārspīlēts, pat ja mēs pieņemtu, argumentējot, ka valdībai ir pārliecinoša interese ierobežot ārvalstu ietekmi uz mūsu politisko procesu.<br/>ASV, pie 615. >><br/><br/>ASV bankrotēja, kad FDR zvanīja zeltā. Mums vairs nebija zelta, lai samaksātu par papīru, ko aizņēmāmies no FED. Tagad tas ir gada bankrota pārnešana. Valdība tagad ir privāta kā BLACKWATER. Visas valdības aģentūras ir uzskaitītas vietnē DUNN UN BRADSTRET. Kopējās tiesības, ko nosaka konstitūcija, attiecas uz fiziskām personām. Visi tiesu darījumi šodien ir korporatīva nozīme, ka mūs uzskata par atsevišķām korporācijām. Mēs pastāvam pēc līguma ar valsti. Atcerieties 14. grozījumu. Pirms tam nebija ASV pilsoņu. Lielākā daļa no mums ir neapzināti pieprasījuši ASV korporatīvo pilsonību. Mums ir jārisina banku elites noteikums. Gandrīz visi vadošie REPS un DEMS ir locekļi ĀRVALSTU ATTIECĪBU PADOMES vai TLC. IZKLAIDE vēsturi, kas sākās un kontrolē šos. Rush, Glenn un Sean ir visi meļi un baņķieri bootlickers. Obama ir leļļu par CFR. 911 patiesībai ir daudz lielāka nozīme, un tā kalpotu, lai apvienotu šīs valsts godīgos cilvēkus.<br/><br/>Es tiešām neticu, ka esmu korporācija vai pilsonis vienu, bet, ja gubbermint domā tā, vai SCOTUS nolēmums nozīmē, ka nav vairāk kampaņas iemaksas ierobežojumi ikvienam, uzņēmumiem vai privātpersonām? Es labāk redzētu naudu, kas izņemta no mūsu vēlēšanu procesa kopumā - vienādu laiku Amerikas radiostacijās bez maksas visiem kandidātiem |

Start small by switching around body parts and re-coloring them. (in other words, just experiment and see which combo you like) 4. Then start to challenging yourself to make more complex sprites. Instead of copying and pasting and recoloring, you can try and draw clothes or faces. 5. PRACTICE PRACTICE AND MORE PRACTICE.

| Interpretive Summary: This book chapter reviews various aspects of what is needed for the selection of model weeds to answer questions pertinent to weed science. Specifically, the chapter covers why we need model species, attributes of model species, and provides the current state of knowledge and resources that have been developed for a few key weeds such as leafy spurge, Canada thistle, waterhemp, and purple false brome that may make them good potential models.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract:<br/>Selection of a limited number of model weeds and development of genomic-based tools and resources will facilitate studies on the ecology, biology, physiology and development of weedy species. Such studies will help answer fundamental questions of concern to weed scientists. However, to ensure the weed science community can appropriately and fully utilize these model weeds, they will need to be carefully selected. Various attributes such as ease of study, weedy characteristics, and importance as a weedy species will need to be considered. Additionally, the availability of existing genomic resources can be used to extend the list of viable model weeds. Several resources have also been developed specifically for weeds such as leafy spurge, Canada thistle, waterhemp, and purple false brome. | Skaidrojošā Kopsavilkums: Šajā grāmatā nodaļā apskatīti dažādi aspekti, kas ir nepieciešami, lai izvēlētos modeļa nezāles, lai atbildētu uz jautājumiem, kas attiecas uz nezāļu zinātni. Konkrētāk, nodaļa aptver, kāpēc mums ir nepieciešams modelis sugas, atribūti modeļa sugas, un nodrošina pašreizējo stāvokli zināšanu un resursu, kas ir izstrādāti dažiem galvenajiem nezālēm, piemēram, lapu spurge, Kanādas dadzis, waterhemp, un purpura viltus brome, kas var padarīt tos labus potenciālos modeļus.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract:<br/>Ierobežota skaita nezāļu modeļu izvēle un uz genomiku balstītu rīku un resursu izstrāde atvieglos nezāļu sugu ekoloģijas, bioloģijas, fizioloģijas un attīstības pētījumus. Šādi pētījumi palīdzēs atbildēt uz fundamentāliem jautājumiem, kas uztrauc nezāļu zinātniekus. Tomēr, lai nodrošinātu, ka nezāļu zinātnieku kopiena var pienācīgi un pilnībā izmantot šos modeļus nezāles, tie būs rūpīgi jāizvēlas. Jāņem vērā dažādi atribūti, piemēram, studiju vieglums, nezāļu īpašības un nezāļu sugas nozīme. Turklāt esošo genomikas resursu pieejamību var izmantot, lai paplašinātu dzīvotspējīgu modeļu nezāļu sarakstu. Vairāki resursi ir izstrādāti arī īpaši nezālēm, piemēram, lapu spurge, Kanādas dadzis, ūdenshemp un purpura viltus broma. |
