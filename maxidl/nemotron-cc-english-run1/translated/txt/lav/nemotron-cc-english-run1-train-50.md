| Concussion: Using Cooling Helmets to Combat Brain Injuries in College Football<br/><br/>Former football player Kevin Jackson uses brain cooling technology in the hopes of reducing the effects of traumatic brain injuries and sports-related concussions.<br/>Jackson was a running back for the University of Illinois from 1990-1994. In addition to suffering a number of injuries to his body during his playing days, Jackson also suffered a number of un-diagnosed concussions. Now a research scientist and injury spotter, Jackson uses his experience as a player to help him understand and combat brain trauma in sports.<br/>This video illustrates the chain of events that occur when a traumatic brain injury happens, explores how concussion symptoms very from person to person, highlights the need to protect oneself from repeated head traumas, and shows how using cooling technologies might aide in recovery from injury.<br/>To learn more about this research, please visit...<br/> | Satricinājums: Izmantojot dzesēšanas ķiveres, lai apkarotu smadzeņu traumas koledžas futbolā<br/><br/>Bijušais futbolists Kevins Džeksons izmanto smadzeņu dzesēšanas tehnoloģiju, cerot samazināt traumatisku smadzeņu traumu un ar sportu saistītu satricinājumu ietekmi.<br/>Jackson bija darbojas atpakaļ uz Ilinoisas universitātē no 1990-1994. Papildus cieš vairākas traumas viņa ķermeņa laikā viņa spēles dienas, Jackson cieta arī vairāki ANO diagnosticēta satricinājumiem. Tagad pētnieks un traumu meklētājs, Džeksons izmanto savu pieredzi kā spēlētājs, lai palīdzētu viņam saprast un cīnīties pret smadzeņu traumu sportā.<br/>Šis video ilustrē notikumu ķēdi, kas notiek, kad notiek traumatisks smadzeņu traumas, pēta, kā smadzeņu satricinājums simptomi ļoti no cilvēka uz cilvēku, uzsver nepieciešamību pasargāt sevi no atkārtotām galvas traumām un parāda, kā dzesēšanas tehnoloģiju izmantošana varētu palīdzēt atgūties no traumām.<br/>Lai uzzinātu vairāk par šo pētījumu, lūdzu, apmeklējiet... |
| Massage Therapy<br/><br/>Massage is perhaps one of the oldest healing traditions. Many ancient peoples – including the Ancient Greeks, Egyptians, Chinese and Indians – were convinced of the therapeutic properties of massage and used it to treat a variety of ailments.<br/><br/>Massage therapy is the practice of kneading or manipulating a person's muscles and other soft-tissue in order to improve their wellbeing or health. It is a form of manual therapy that includes holding, moving, and applying pressure to the muscles, tendons, ligaments and fascia.<br/><br/>The term 'massage therapy' is used to describe a wide variety of techniques that vary in the manner in which touch, pressure and the intensity of the treatment is applied.<br/><br/>Massage for treatment of some disorders<br/><br/>Research indicates that massage and myotherapy are effective in managing:<br/><br/>subacute/chronic low back pain<br/><br/>delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS)<br/><br/>anxiety<br/><br/>stress<br/><br/>soft tissue injuries<br/><br/>high blood pressure<br/><br/>insomnia.<br/><br/>They can also be effectively used to support people with:<br/><br/>a chronic disease<br/><br/>a life threatening illness such as cancer.<br/><br/>Benefits of massage<br/><br/>One of the immediate benefits of massage is a feeling of deep relaxation and calm. This occurs because massage prompts the release of endorphins – the brain chemicals (neurotransmitters) that produce feelings of wellbeing.<br/><br/>Levels of stress hormones, such as adrenalin, cortisol and norepinephrine, are also reduced. Studies indicate that high levels of stress hormones impair the immune system.<br/><br/>Some of the physical benefits of massage and myotherapy include:<br/><br/>reduced muscle tension<br/><br/>improved circulation<br/><br/>stimulation of the lymphatic system<br/><br/>reduction of stress hormones<br/><br/>relaxation<br/><br/>increased joint mobility and flexibility<br/><br/>improved skin tone<br/><br/>improved recovery of soft tissue injuries<br/><br/>heightened mental alertness<br/><br/>reduced anxiety and depression | Masāžas terapija<br/><br/>Masāža, iespējams, ir viena no senākajām dziedināšanas tradīcijām. Daudzas senas tautas, tostarp senie grieķi, ēģiptieši, ķīnieši un indiāņi, bija pārliecinātas par masāžas ārstnieciskajām īpašībām un izmantoja to dažādu slimību ārstēšanai.<br/><br/>Masāžas terapija ir prakse mīcīšanas vai manipulējot cilvēka muskuļus un citu mīksto audu, lai uzlabotu savu labklājību vai veselību. Tas ir manuālās terapijas veids, kas ietver muskuļu, cīpslu, saišu un fasciju turēšanu, pārvietošanu un spiediena piemērošanu.<br/><br/>Termins "masāžas terapija" tiek izmantots, lai aprakstītu dažādas metodes, kas atšķiras veidā, kādā pieskārienu, spiedienu un ārstēšanas intensitāte.<br/><br/>Masāža dažu traucējumu ārstēšanai<br/><br/>Pētījumi liecina, ka masāža un mioterapija ir efektīvas, lai pārvaldītu:<br/><br/>subakūtas/hroniskas sāpes muguras lejasdaļā<br/><br/>aizkavēts muskuļu sāpīgums (DOMS);<br/><br/>trauksme;<br/><br/>stress;<br/><br/>mīksto audu traumas<br/><br/>augsts asinsspiediens;<br/><br/>bezmiegs.<br/><br/>Tos var arī efektīvi izmantot, lai atbalstītu cilvēkus ar:<br/><br/>hroniska slimība<br/><br/>dzīvību apdraudoša slimība, piemēram, vēzis.<br/><br/>Masāžas priekšrocības<br/><br/>Viens no tūlītējiem ieguvumiem no masāžas ir sajūta dziļu relaksāciju un klusums. Tas notiek tāpēc, ka masāža liek atbrīvot endorphins - smadzeņu ķimikālijas (neirotransmiteri), kas rada jūtas labklājību.<br/><br/>Samazinās arī stresa hormonu līmenis, piemēram, adrenalīns, kortizols un norepinefrīns. Pētījumi liecina, ka augsts stresa hormonu līmenis ietekmē imūnsistēmu.<br/><br/>Daži no fiziskās priekšrocības masāžas un mioterapijas ietver:<br/><br/>samazināts muskuļu saspringums<br/><br/>uzlabota apgrozība<br/><br/>limfātiskās sistēmas stimulēšana<br/><br/>stresa hormonu samazināšana<br/><br/>relaksācija<br/><br/>palielināta locītavu kustīgums un elastīgums<br/><br/>uzlabots ādas tonis<br/><br/>uzlabota mīksto audu traumu atgūšana<br/><br/>paaugstināta modrība;<br/><br/>samazināta trauksme un depresija; |

| Mistakes happen and it can be a long road to recovery when it comes to rebuilding credit.<br/><br/>The Shopping Cart trick is useful for people who have:<br/><br/>1. Declared bankruptcy in the past and is trying to recover 2. Defaulted on payments in the past 3. A lot of credit inquiries and doesn't want to add more inquiries 4. Made late payments in the past and had their accounts closed because of this 5. Someone who doesn't have a credit score at all<br/><br/>The caveat is If they ask you to enter your whole social security number, and not just the last 4, then it will most likely be a hard inquiry. With anything mentioned in this post, your mileage may vary, so it may work for some people and not for others.<br/><br/>If you use this method and have defaulted on payments in the past, be sure to pay off your bills every month.<br/><br/>The Shopping Cart Trick<br/><br/>The Shopping Cart Trick is visiting a website and waiting for a credit card offer to pop up when you check out. You do not need to purchase anything, it will appear before the payment page. This method only works for certain stores.<br/><br/>A few examples are Express, Overstock.com, and Williams-Sonoma. There are a few Synchrony cards like Walmart and QVC that work as well. Full list of stores can be found at the end of this post.<br/><br/>When you go through the process, be sure to have the ad blocker turned off and enter your real address. If the store can't match the last 4 digits of your SSN with your address, then the soft pull won't work. Again, you might have to go through the shopping process a few times before you receive an offer. You don't have to buy anything.<br/><br/>The credit limits might be lower for some people, but the idea is to rebuild your credit. If you do choose to go through this process, I recommend picking stores you will actually shop. It doesn't make sense to get a bonus or points at a store you don't shop at. Most, if not all of the cards, don't have annual fees, so they are good as foundation cards.<br/><br/>For me, this trick doesn't work out well because I don't frequent the listed shops often | Kļūdas notiek, un tas var būt ilgs ceļš uz atveseļošanos, kad runa ir par kredīta atjaunošanu.<br/><br/>Iepirkumu Groza triks ir noderīgs cilvēkiem, kuriem ir:<br/><br/>1. Iepriekš deklarētais bankrots un mēģina atgūt 2. Noklusējuma maksājumi pagātnē 3. Daudz kredītu pieprasījumu un nevēlas pievienot papildu pieprasījumus 4. Iepriekš veikti novēloti maksājumi, un to konti tika slēgti, jo tas ir 5. Kāds, kurš nav kredīta score vispār<br/><br/>Brīdinājums ir, ja viņi lūdz jūs ievadīt visu savu sociālās apdrošināšanas numuru, un ne tikai pēdējo 4, tad tas, visticamāk, būs grūti izmeklēšana. Ar kaut ko minēts šajā amatā, jūsu nobraukums var atšķirties, tāpēc tas var darboties dažiem cilvēkiem, nevis citiem.<br/><br/>Ja jūs izmantojat šo metodi un iepriekš neesat veicis maksājumus, noteikti nomaksājiet rēķinus katru mēnesi.<br/><br/>Iepirkumu grozs triks<br/><br/>Iepirkumu grozs triks apmeklē tīmekļa vietni un gaida kredītkartes piedāvājumu pop up, kad jūs izbraukšana. Jums nav nepieciešams iegādāties kaut ko, tas parādīsies pirms maksājuma lapu. Šī metode darbojas tikai uz noteiktiem veikaliem.<br/><br/>Daži piemēri ir Express, Overstock.com, un Williams-Sonoma. Ir daži Synchrony kartes, piemēram, Walmart un QVC, kas strādā, kā arī. Pilns saraksts veikalos var atrast beigās šo ziņu.<br/><br/>Veicot šo procesu, noteikti izslēdziet reklāmu bloķētāju un ievadiet savu reālo adresi. Ja veikals neatbilst pēdējiem 4 jūsu SSN cipariem ar jūsu adresi, mīkstā vilkšana nedarbosies. Vēlreiz, jums var būt nepieciešams, lai iet caur iepirkšanās procesu dažas reizes, pirms jūs saņemat piedāvājumu. Jums nav nopirkt neko.<br/><br/>Dažiem cilvēkiem kredītlimits var būt zemāks, bet ideja ir atjaunot jūsu kredītu. Ja jūs izvēlaties iet cauri šim procesam, es iesaku izvēlēties veikalus, kurus jūs faktiski iepērkaties. Tas nav jēgas, lai saņemtu bonusu vai punktus veikalā jums nav iepirkties. Lielākā daļa, ja ne visas kartes, nav gada maksas, tāpēc tie ir labi, kā pamata kartes.<br/><br/>Man šis triks nedarbojas labi, jo es bieži apmeklēju uzskaitītos veikalus |
| Composition in Design – 15 Things You Can't Afford NOT to Know<br/><br/>Composition is one of the six crucial elements of design. Without strong and solid design composition, everything starts falling apart.<br/><br/>In this article we will give you 15 tips on how to strengthen your composition – no matter if it's a photography, illustration or any graphic design project.<br/><br/>We also prepared a beautiful collection of designs in the end, for your inspirarion. Enjoy!<br/><br/>1 . Direct the eye with leading lines<br/><br/>Usually, when you look at any visual, your eye falls first on particular object. In this case, this is the car and it is the focal point of the poster. We will talk a little bit more in our second point of the article. But if your eyes are immidiatelt attracted to certain part of visual, where do you look next? That is a tough question to start with, but a simple answer would be – you look where your eyes lead you. And your eyes lead you, where the designer uses leading lines to direct you through the layout. In this case, a leading line is the road. It also nicely frames the text on the left side and leads your eye back to the focal point of the poster.<br/><br/>Often lines can be more obvious then here, directly using arrows, flowcharts and are very useful method for explaining information and sequences.<br/><br/>2. Create focus in your design composition<br/><br/>A key element to design composition is having a strong focal point. No matter how many elements you have in your design, you have to stress and show the viewer, which is the most important part of your piece. In this case, the artist used color, contrast and scale to organize the space and create focal point. Keep in mind that the most important role of design is to communicate. Therefore, your focal point would be also your most important statement and message to your audience!<br/><br/>3. Use hierachy<br/><br/>Once that you've created your focal point, you have to figure out what to do with the rest of the elements of your design composition. Of course, you have structure these elements as well, and set a priority to them. In this example, the focal point is the man in the picture. Then, we have to look for a name of the event, what is the whole thing about. Only after that, we can keep looking for additional info, such as subheadings, dates, numbers, etc.<br/><br/>All this organization of the information with the help of size, color, weight is called hierachy.<br/><br/>4. Use complementing elements<br/><br/>Always seek to create unifed look throughout your entire design. It is not a good idea to mix and match images from different sources, with no simillarities in style between them. This will only tire the eyes of the viewer and confuse him/her.<br/><br/>This website design is a great example of cohesiveness between the images – they all have simple, one color background and the object are placed in the center. Of course, your design solution would depend on the specific project need.<br/><br/>In this case, you want the viewer to recognize and focus easily on the item to be bought, without any other distraction. The overal feel of the top image and color scheme is also repeated in the backgrounds of the products, so this is one more nice connection between the different parts of the design!<br/><br/>5. Repeat elements<br/><br/>Often your projects will consist of more than one page. If you repeat specific elements from one section of your design to another, you will help the viewer to orientate himself/ herself easier across the design.<br/><br/>Repeating elements are often used to create a certain theme as well and again, help the designcomposition to "stick together".<br/><br/>Some of the repeating elements you could use are: graphic motifs, type, cetrain layout reused in the different pages/parts of your project.<br/><br/>6. Balance elements<br/><br/>There are two types of balance in design composition – symmetrical and asymmetrical. The first uses similar elements, mirrored (distributed equally) on the both sides of an axis (visible or non-visible line). Symmetrical balance is very clean and elegant, but sometimes it can get a bit boring, so then, designers prefer asymmetrical balance instead. Obviously, in this scenario we won't have equal in size elements, placed in similar way.<br/><br/>Here, we look at the different sizes of the elements, the textures and so on. It helps to think of a design elements, as they have "weight". Larger elements would be "heavier". For example, if you have a big, "heavy", vertically pointing pumpkin, you can "balance" it out by using several horizontal lines and smaller objects on the opposite side of the "heavy" object.<br/><br/>7. Align elements<br/><br/>Alignment is another important tool to use in design composition and organize your elements. It often comes handy wen you have a lot of types, colors, images, headings and subheadings. There are many tools on the web, which can help you to snap and align elements to each other, leaving no room for floating pieces and messy design. Alignment brings an elegant vibe to a design. Even the most asymetric designs have some sorts of alignment and structuring of similar blocks of content.<br/><br/>It is a general rule, that when you have a long blocks of texts, left alignment would help the eye to scan more easily teh content. This poster is great visualization of this concept.<br/><br/>8. Use contrast<br/><br/>Contrast is used for drawing attention. If you boost the contrast of an element, this will make it pop. On the contrary, using elements with lower contrast will make them fade and "disappear".<br/><br/>Here, the contrast underlines the strong, geometic, bold architectural forms and the play of light and shadow. Not on last place, the small figure might be with lower contrast, compared to other elements, but it is still visible and nicely balances out the big, dark shape at the opposite, top left corner.<br/><br/>9. Use white space<br/><br/>White space is unreplacable tool in bringing clarity into your design composition. White space is not an "empty space", but necessary element, allowing your design to breathe. It also helps emphasizing the subject of interest.<br/><br/>For example, in this photo, all the white space (unoccupied by other elements) helps to focus all the attention on the woman figure and her posture. Do you think you would pay attention to this woman, if the image was filled in with many other elements? To help you understand the importance of white space, thinks of your own room. How would you feel if you have only one small passage from the door to the bed and everything is piled up with objects? How would you feel, if your bed doesn't not fill the whole room and there are no objects all around the place. Yes, you get the ideas – we all need space, even the design does.<br/><br/>10. Understand and use type of layouts<br/><br/>The first one we are going to look at is the so called, big photo or single visual layout which was was very popular for web designers in the recent years. It gives elegant, clean look, usually highlights a product or service with the help of single high-quality, engaging photo. This type of layout gives a sense of space. As you can suggest, it is not commonly used for news sites, where there is a lot of information to be presented. Here key phrase is quality over quantity.<br/><br/>Key elements to this type of layout are white space and simple typo.<br/><br/>Another type of layout is the Z layout. This is where the eye of the viewer is lead from one element of the design to other.<br/><br/>In this example we naturally first look at the photo, than our eyes are drawn to the text on the right side of the visual and then we continue scanning down, jumping from visual to text. Z layouts create rhythm and are often used on website with lot of information, where you have to orientate the user and "guide" him.<br/><br/>Another way to keep things nice, neat and organized is to use the so called golden ratio or rule of thirds. You can read more about in our article for taking amazing photos, where the same principle applies to photography. In short, dividing your layout into thirds – both vertically and horizontally and placing most important elements where these lines cross, will make your design more visually pleasing.<br/><br/>The example here is MailChimp's website. Notice how the monkey character is slightly to the left? It simply looks good! Oh, and one more thing – when you move a character across space, move it from left to right.<br/><br/>11. Create movement<br/><br/>Movement is change of place or position, an effort. It can be actual motion or it can be implied — arranging parts of the image so that the viewer gets a sense of motion by using lines, shapes, forms, textures, etc.<br/><br/>Since ancient times our eyes are more attracted to moving objects than still ones, and this was important for one's survival – in hunting and protecting yourself from animals. That is why, people are very attracted to images that depict movement and respectively, a composition with nice "flow" of elements is more intriguing.<br/><br/>12. People like triangles<br/><br/>The shape of triangle creates interest, sets a direction and creates movement. Surely, it is a very strong shape and designers and artists use it to organize their layout as well, and not only as visual element. In the recent years, it became hugely popular with the polygon design.<br/><br/>13. Simplification<br/><br/>Simplification is the technique of reducing a composition to only the most essential elements that support the visual statement.<br/><br/>If every part is equally important, then every part is equally unimportant. Nathan Fowkes<br/><br/>It is natural for the eyes to look at details, but it is very hard to see the design as whole and how all elements work together. When in doubt, better remove elements from your design composition, rather adding and trying to find a place for them. We know it's a cliche – but it is still legit "Less is more"!<br/><br/>14. See where your elements are in relation to edges<br/><br/>Often, you will see designers using blank space around the edges of the layout, giving the design room to breathe. Again it is natural to the eye to see elements receeding around edges and fading out. If it is busy around the edges in your design – the overal feel would be of something heavy, big and it will take away from the attention of central elements.<br/><br/>In this case, the designer used large, abstract shape to underline the typo – yeard and names. Because the shape is directing the eye, varied in thickness and has sense of movement to it, it doesn't overwhelm the viewer, but on the contrary – offers him/her aesthetic pleasure and simplicity.<br/><br/>15. Mind the transitions<br/><br/>Transition in design composition is a little bit harder to define. We discussed repetition already, in comparison, transition handles the natural flow from one shape to another, leading the eye from one spot to another. Often, designers use curved lines and shapes to smoothen transition from more angular shapes and blocks of content. Transition helps to relax the eye and "soften" the design.<br/><br/>Looking for some inspiration?<br/><br/>Now that you learnt something about the most important ingredients of good design composition, we made a small gallery with design compositions we find inspiring. Enjoy | Sastāvs dizainā – 15 lietas, kuras nevar zināt<br/><br/>Sastāvs ir viens no sešiem svarīgākajiem dizaina elementiem. Bez spēcīga un izturīga dizaina sastāva viss sāk sabrukt.<br/><br/>Šajā rakstā mēs sniegsim jums 15 padomus, kā stiprināt savu kompozīciju – neatkarīgi no tā, vai tā ir fotogrāfija, ilustrācija vai jebkurš grafiskā dizaina projekts.<br/><br/>Mēs arī sagatavoja skaistu kolekciju dizainu beigās, lai jūsu inspirarion. Baudīt!<br/><br/>1 . Virzīt acs ar vadošajām līnijām<br/><br/>Parasti, kad paskatās uz jebkuru vizuālu, jūsu acs vispirms nokrīt uz konkrētu objektu. Šajā gadījumā tas ir automobilis, un tas ir plakāta centrālais punkts. Mēs runāsim nedaudz vairāk mūsu otrajā raksta punktā. Bet, ja acis ir imidiatelt piesaista noteiktu daļu no vizuālā, kur jūs meklēt nākamo? Tas ir grūts jautājums, lai sāktu ar, bet vienkārša atbilde būtu – jūs meklēt, kur jūsu acis vadīt jums. Un jūsu acis ved jūs, kur dizainers izmanto vadošās līnijas, lai virzītu jūs cauri izkārtojumam. Šajā gadījumā vadošā līnija ir ceļš. Tas arī labi ierāmē tekstu kreisajā pusē un noved acis atpakaļ uz plakāta fokusa punktu.<br/><br/>Bieži vien līnijas var būt acīmredzamas, tad šeit, tieši izmantojot bultiņas, blokshēmas un ir ļoti noderīga metode, lai izskaidrotu informāciju un secības.<br/><br/>2. Izveidojiet fokusu savā dizaina kompozīcijā<br/><br/>Galvenais elements, lai izstrādātu kompozīciju, ir spēcīgs fokusa punkts. Neatkarīgi no tā, cik daudz elementu ir jūsu dizainā, jums ir jāuzsver un jāparāda skatītājam, kas ir vissvarīgākā jūsu darba daļa. Šajā gadījumā, mākslinieks izmanto krāsu, kontrastu un mērogu, lai organizētu telpu un izveidot kontaktpunktu. Paturiet prātā, ka svarīgākais uzdevums dizains ir sazināties. Tāpēc jūsu kontaktpunkts būs arī jūsu vissvarīgākais paziņojums un vēstījums jūsu auditorijai!<br/><br/>3. Izmantojiet hierachy<br/><br/>Kad esat izveidojis savu fokusa punktu, jums ir izdomāt, ko darīt ar pārējiem elementiem jūsu dizaina kompozīcijas. Protams, jums ir struktūra šos elementus, kā arī, un noteikt prioritāti tiem. Šajā piemērā centrālais punkts ir attēlā redzamais cilvēks. Tad mums ir jāmeklē notikuma nosaukums, par ko viss ir. Tikai pēc tam mēs varam turpināt meklēt papildu informāciju, piemēram, apakšpozīcijas, datumus, skaitļus utt.<br/><br/>Visu šo informācijas organizāciju, izmantojot izmēru, krāsu, svaru, sauc par hierarhiju.<br/><br/>4. Izmantojiet papildinošus elementus<br/><br/>Vienmēr mēģiniet izveidot vienotu izskatu visā dizainā. Nav laba ideja sajaukt un saskaņot attēlus no dažādiem avotiem, starp tiem nav līdzīgu stilu. Tas tikai nogurdina skatītāja acis un mulsina viņu.<br/><br/>Šis mājas lapas dizains ir lielisks vienotības piemērs starp attēliem – tiem visiem ir vienkāršs, viens krāsu fons un objekts ir novietots centrā. Protams, Jūsu dizaina risinājums būtu atkarīgs no konkrētā projekta vajadzībām.<br/><br/>Šajā gadījumā jūs vēlaties, lai skatītājs viegli atpazītu un koncentrētos uz iegādājamo priekšmetu bez citas uzmanības. Augšējā attēla un krāsu shēmas overal sajūta tiek atkārtota arī produktu fonā, tāpēc tas ir vēl viens jauks savienojums starp dažādām dizaina daļām!<br/><br/>5. Atkārtojiet elementus<br/><br/>Bieži vien tavi projekti sastāvēs no vairāk nekā vienas lapas. Ja tu atkārtosi konkrētus elementus no vienas dizaina sadaļas uz citu, tu palīdzēsi skatītājam vieglāk orientēties visā dizainā.<br/><br/>Atkārtoti elementi bieži tiek izmantoti, lai izveidotu noteiktu tēmu, kā arī atkal, palīdziet dizainakompozīcija "salīmēt kopā".<br/><br/>Daži no elementiem, kas atkārtojas, ir: grafiskie motīvi, tips, celin izkārtojums, kas tiek atkārtoti izmantots dažādās projekta lapās/daļās.<br/><br/>6. Balansa elementi<br/><br/>Ir divu veidu līdzsvars dizaina kompozīcijā – simetrisks un asimetrisks. Pirmais izmanto līdzīgus elementus, kas ir atspoguļoti (izkliedēti vienādi) abās ass pusēs (redzama vai neredzama līnija). Simetrisks līdzsvars ir ļoti tīrs un elegants, bet dažreiz tas var būt mazliet garlaicīgs, tāpēc dizaineri dod priekšroku asimetriskam līdzsvaram. Acīmredzot šajā scenārijā mums nebūs vienāda izmēra elementu, kas novietoti līdzīgā veidā.<br/><br/>Lūk, mēs skatāmies uz dažāda lieluma elementu, faktūru un tā tālāk. Tas palīdz domāt par dizaina elementiem, jo tie ir "svars". Lielāki elementi būtu "smagāki". Piemēram, ja jums ir liels, "smags", vertikāli norādot ķirbju, jūs varat "sabalansēt" to, izmantojot vairākas horizontālas līnijas un mazākus objektus pretējā pusē "smags" objektu.<br/><br/>7. Izlīdzināt elementi<br/><br/>Saskaņošana ir vēl viens svarīgs rīks, ko izmantot dizaina kompozīcijā un organizēt savus elementus. Tas bieži nāk parocīgs Wen jums ir daudz veidu, krāsu, attēlu, virsrakstu un apakšvirsrakstu. Tīmeklī ir daudz rīku, kas var palīdzēt jums snap un saskaņot elementus savā starpā, neatstājot vietu peldošiem gabaliem un netīram dizainam. Saskaņošana rada elegantu atmosfēru dizainam. Pat visvairāk asimetrisku dizainu ir sava veida saskaņošanu un strukturēšanu līdzīgu bloku saturu.<br/><br/>Tas ir vispārējs noteikums, ka, ja jums ir garš bloku tekstu, pa kreisi līdzinājums palīdzētu acs, lai skenētu vieglāk teh saturu. Šis plakāts ir lieliska vizualizācija šo koncepciju.<br/><br/>8. Izmantojiet kontrastu<br/><br/>Kontrasts tiek izmantots, lai pievērstu uzmanību. Ja jūs palielināsiet elementa kontrastu, tas padarīs to pop. Gluži pretēji, izmantojot elementus ar zemāku kontrastu, tie izzudīs un "izzudīs".<br/><br/>Šeit kontrasts uzsver spēcīgās, ģeometriskās, drosmīgās arhitektūras formas un gaismas un ēnas spēli. Ne pēdējā vietā, mazais skaitlis varētu būt ar zemāku kontrastu, salīdzinot ar citiem elementiem, bet tas joprojām ir redzams un labi līdzsvaro lielo, tumšo formu pretējā, augšējā kreisajā stūrī.<br/><br/>9. Izmantojiet atstarpi<br/><br/>Baltā telpa ir neatvairāms instruments, lai sniegtu skaidrību jūsu dizaina kompozīcijā. Baltā telpa nav "tukša telpa", bet gan nepieciešams elements, kas ļauj jūsu dizainam elpot. Tas arī palīdz uzsvērt interesējošo tēmu.<br/><br/>Piemēram, šajā fotoattēlā visa baltā telpa (citu elementu aizņemta) palīdz koncentrēt visu uzmanību uz sievietes figūru un viņas stāju. Vai jūs domājat, ka jūs pievērstu uzmanību šai sievietei, ja attēls tiktu aizpildīts ar daudziem citiem elementiem? Lai palīdzētu jums saprast, cik svarīga ir telpa, domājiet par savu istabu. Kā jūs justos, ja jums būtu tikai viena neliela eja no durvīm līdz gultai un viss būtu sakrauts ar priekšmetiem? Kā tu justos, ja tava gulta neaizpilda visu telpu un apkārt nav neviena objekta. Jā, idejas rodas – mums visiem ir nepieciešama telpa, pat dizains.<br/><br/>10. Izprotiet un izmantojiet izkārtojuma veidu<br/><br/>Pirmais, ko mēs apskatīsim, ir tā sauktais lielais foto vai viens vizuālais izkārtojums, kas pēdējos gados bija ļoti populārs tīmekļa dizaineriem. Tas dod elegantu, tīru izskatu, parasti izceļ produktu vai pakalpojumu, izmantojot vienu augstas kvalitātes, saistošu fotoattēlu. Šis izkārtojuma veids dod telpas izjūtu. Kā jūs varat ieteikt, tas nav bieži izmanto ziņu portālos, kur ir daudz informācijas, kas jāiesniedz. Šeit atslēga frāze ir kvalitāte pār daudzumu.<br/><br/>Galvenie šāda veida izkārtojuma elementi ir baltā atstarpe un vienkārša drukas kļūda.<br/><br/>Vēl viens izkārtojuma veids ir Z izkārtojums. Tas ir, ja skatītāja acs ir vadībā no viena dizaina elementa uz otru.<br/><br/>Šajā piemērā mēs, protams, vispirms apskatīt foto, nekā mūsu acis ir vērsta uz tekstu labajā pusē vizuālo un tad mēs turpinām skenēšanu uz leju, lekt no vizuālā uz tekstu. Z izkārtojumi rada ritmu un bieži tiek izmantoti mājas lapā ar daudz informācijas, kur jums ir orientēties lietotāju un "vadīt" viņu.<br/><br/>Vēl viens veids, kā saglabāt lietas jaukas, kārtīgas un organizētas, ir izmantot tā saukto zelta attiecību vai trešo noteikumu. Jūs varat izlasīt vairāk par to mūsu rakstā, lai uzņemtu pārsteidzošus fotoattēlus, kur tas pats princips attiecas uz fotogrāfiju. Īsi sakot, dalot jūsu izkārtojumu trešdaļās – gan vertikāli, gan horizontāli, un novietojot svarīgākos elementus, kur šīs līnijas krustojas, jūsu dizains kļūs vizuāli pievilcīgāks.<br/><br/>Piemērs šeit ir MailChimp tīmekļa vietne. Ievērojiet, kā pērtiķu raksturs ir nedaudz pa kreisi? Tas vienkārši izskatās labi! Ak, un vēl viena lieta - kad pārvietojat rakstzīmi pāri telpai, pārvietojiet to no kreisās puses uz labo.<br/><br/>11. Izveidot kustību<br/><br/>Kustība ir vietas vai pozīcijas maiņa, piepūle. Tā var būt faktiska kustība vai arī tā var ietvert attēla daļu sakārtošanu tā, lai skatītājs iegūtu kustības sajūtu, izmantojot līnijas, formas, formas, faktūras utt.<br/><br/>Kopš seniem laikiem mūsu acis vairāk piesaista kustīgi objekti nekā nekustīgi objekti, un tas ir svarīgi cilvēka izdzīvošanai – medībās un sevis pasargāšanā no dzīvniekiem. Tāpēc cilvēki ir ļoti piesaistīti attēliem, kas attēlo kustību un attiecīgi kompozīciju ar jauku elementu "plūsmu" ir intriģējošāka.<br/><br/>12. Cilvēkiem, piemēram, trijstūri<br/><br/>Trīsstūra forma rada interesi, nosaka virzienu un rada kustību. Protams, tā ir ļoti spēcīga forma, un dizaineri un mākslinieki to izmanto, lai organizētu arī savu izkārtojumu, nevis tikai kā vizuālo elementu. Pēdējos gados tas kļuva ļoti populārs ar daudzstūra dizainu.<br/><br/>13. Vienkāršošana<br/><br/>Vienkāršošana ir paņēmiens, kā samazināt kompozīciju līdz tikai vissvarīgākajiem elementiem, kas atbalsta vizuālo paziņojumu.<br/><br/>Ja katra daļa ir vienlīdz svarīga, tad katra daļa ir tikpat svarīga.<br/><br/>Acīm ir dabiski aplūkot detaļas, bet ir ļoti grūti redzēt dizainu kopumā un to, kā visi elementi darbojas kopā. Šaubu gadījumā labāk noņemiet elementus no dizaina kompozīcijas, nevis pievienojot un cenšoties atrast vietu tiem. Mēs zinām, ka tā ir klišeja – bet tas joprojām ir legit "mazāk ir vairāk"!<br/><br/>14. Redzēt, kur jūsu elementi ir attiecībā pret malām<br/><br/>Bieži vien jūs redzēsiet, ka dizaineri izmanto tukšu telpu ap izkārtojuma malām, dodot dizaina telpai elpot. Atkal ir dabiski redzēt elementus, kas parādās ap malām un izgaist. Ja jūsu dizainā tas ir aizņemts ap malām – pārspīlētā sajūta būtu kaut kas smags, liels, un tas atņems centrālo elementu uzmanību.<br/><br/>Šajā gadījumā dizainers izmantoja lielu, abstraktu formu, lai uzsvērtu typo – gadu un nosaukumus. Tā kā forma virza skatienu, ir dažāda biezuma un tai piemīt kustību sajūta, tā nepārspīlē skatītāju, bet tieši pretēji – piedāvā estētisku baudījumu un vienkāršību.<br/><br/>15. Mind pārejām<br/><br/>Pāreja dizaina kompozīcijā ir nedaudz grūtāk definējama. Mēs apspriedām atkārtošanos jau, salīdzinot, pāreja apstrādā dabisko plūsmu no vienas formas uz otru, novedot aci no vienas vietas uz otru. Bieži vien dizaineri izmanto izliektas līnijas un formas, lai izlīdzinātu pāreju no vairākām leņķa formām un satura blokiem. Pāreja palīdz atpūsties acīm un "mīkstina" dizainu.<br/><br/>Meklējat iedvesmu?<br/><br/>Tagad, kad esat kaut ko iemācījušies par svarīgākajām sastāvdaļām labā dizaina kompozīcijā, mēs izveidojām nelielu galeriju ar dizaina kompozīcijām, kuras mēs uzskatām par iedvesmojošām. |

| Memory CD8+ T cells are essential cells of the immune system, retained post infection to protect from subsequent immunological insults. Many transcriptional regulators and some proximal signaling cascades associated with both naive and memory T cells have been described and have greatly informed the process by which immunological memory is formed. Despite clear differences in transcription factor expression and cytokine requirements, how global signal transduction induced by antigen binding differs between naive and memory CD8+ T cells is completely unknown and thus represents a significant gap in our knowledge base. One key signaling event that occurs in response to TCR stimulation is the activation of kinases that phosphorylate tyrosine residues on downstream signaling proteins. Therefore, comparing the phosphotyrosine signaling networks between naive and memory T cells will identify targets for modulation of the CD8+ T cell immune response to positively influence response to disease and vaccine efficacy. The objective of this specific proposal is to determine the intracellular signaling pathways that are unique to restimulated memory CD8+ T cells. Our central hypothesis is that distinct signal transduction pathways regulate the memory CD8+ T cell response. The rationale and scientific premise for the proposed work is that understanding at a global proteomic level the changes that occur in T cells as they differentiate from naive to memory T cells will enable more efficacious vaccine and drug treatment design to combat disease and infection. We will test our central hypothesis with the following specific aims: 1) Determine the TCR signal transduction changes that occur in CD8+ nave and memory T cells. To profile kinase signaling networks, we will utilize a highly sensitive quantitative mass spectrometric assay we developed on naive, effector and memory CD8+ T cells. Based on a preliminary screen, we identified that Jak2 is hyperphosphorylated, indicating it is a key mediator of the recall response. We will test the hypothesis that Jak2 hyperactivation is critical for memory recall responses. Together, the completion of Aim1 will identify novel signaling networks that contribute to CD8+ memory recall responses and 2) Defining phosphorylation of CREB binding protein (CBP) as a molecular switch that regulates transcriptional networks in memory CD8+ T cells. Given our preliminary data in which we uncovered unique signaling pathways associated with CD8+ memory T cell formation, we hypothesize that in memory CD8+ T cells, increased Jak2 activation drives phosphorylation of CBP to promote a unique transcriptional landscape versus a nave T cell. We will identify how phosphorylation of CBP regulates binding of transcription factors such as CREB and MYB. Additionally, we will take a genetic approach to determine how CBP functions in the formation of CD8+ memory cells and CD8+ memory recall responses. Together, data obtained in this Aim2 will establish a novel mechanism that explains how changes in tyrosine kinase activity associated with CD8+ T cell memory formation drive unique transcriptional programs.<br/><br/>Public Health Relevance<br/><br/>The studies proposed herein will determine, using mass spectrometry, the signal transduction events that take place in memory CD8+ T cells upon restimulation, relative to nave CD8+ T cells. Given that these cells play an essential role in protection from secondary infection, it is imperative that we understand the molecular mechanisms by which these cells exert their effector function for the protection of human health. | Atmiņa CD8+ T šūnas ir būtiskas imūnsistēmas šūnas, kas saglabājušās pēc inficēšanās, lai pasargātu no turpmākiem imunoloģiskiem apvainojumiem. Daudzi transkripcijas regulatori un dažas proksimālās signalizācijas kaskādes, kas saistītas gan ar naivām, gan atmiņas T šūnām, ir aprakstītas un ir ievērojami informējušas procesu, kurā veidojas imunoloģiskā atmiņa. Neskatoties uz acīmredzamām atšķirībām transkripcijas faktora ekspresijā un citokīnu prasībās, kā globālā signālu transdukcija, ko izraisa antigēna saistīšanās, atšķiras starp naivām un atmiņas CD8+ T šūnām, ir pilnīgi nezināma un tādējādi rada būtisku plaisu mūsu zināšanu bāzē. Viens no galvenajiem signalizācijas gadījumiem, kas rodas kā atbildes reakcija uz TCR stimulāciju, ir kināžu aktivācija, ka fosforilē tirozīna atliekas uz signālierīcēm. Tāpēc, salīdzinot fosfotirozīna signālu tīklus starp naivām un atmiņas T šūnām, tiks noteikti CD8 + T šūnu imūnās atbildes reakcijas modulācijas mērķi, lai pozitīvi ietekmētu reakciju uz slimību un vakcīnas efektivitāti. Šī konkrētā priekšlikuma mērķis ir noteikt intracelulāros signalizēšanas ceļus, kas ir unikāli atjaunotās atmiņas CD8 + T šūnām. Mūsu centrālā hipotēze ir tāda, ka atšķirīgi signāla pārvadīšanas ceļi regulē atmiņas CD8 + T šūnu reakciju. Ierosinātā darba loģiskais pamatojums un zinātniskais priekšnoteikums ir tāds, ka, izprotot globālā proteomiskā līmenī izmaiņas, kas notiek T šūnās, jo tās atšķiras no naivām uz atmiņas T šūnām, būs iespējams efektīvāks vakcīnu un zāļu ārstēšanas veids, lai apkarotu slimības un infekcijas. Mēs pārbaudīsim mūsu centrālo hipotēzi ar šādiem konkrētiem mērķiem: 1) Nosakiet TCR signāla transdukcijas izmaiņas, kas rodas CD8+ navās un atmiņas T šūnās. Lai izveidotu kināzes signālu tīklus, mēs izmantosim ļoti jutīgu kvantitatīvo masspektrometrisko testu, ko izstrādājām uz naivām, efektorām un atmiņas CD8+ T šūnām. Pamatojoties uz sākotnējo ekrānu, mēs noteicām, ka Jak2 ir hiperfosforilēts, norādot, ka tas ir galvenais atsaukšanas reakcijas mediators. Mēs pārbaudīsim hipotēzi, ka Jak2 hiperaktivācija ir kritiska atmiņas atsaukšanas atbildēm. Kopā Aim1 pabeigšana identificēs jaunus signalizēšanas tīklus, kas veicina CD8+ atmiņas atsaukšanas atbildes, un 2) CREB saistošā proteīna (CBP) fosforilēšanu kā molekulāro slēdzi, kas regulē transkripcijas tīklus atmiņas CD8+ T šūnās. Ņemot vērā mūsu sākotnējos datus, kuros mēs atklājām unikālus signālceļus, kas saistīti ar CD8+ atmiņas T šūnu veidošanos, mēs domājam, ka atmiņas CD8+ T šūnās palielinātā Jak2 aktivācija veicina CBP fosforilēšanu, lai veicinātu unikālu transkripcijas ainavu salīdzinājumā ar nave T šūnu. Mēs identificēsim, kā CBP fosforilēšana regulē transkripcijas faktoru saistīšanos, piemēram, CREB un MYB. Turklāt mēs izmantosim ģenētisku pieeju, lai noteiktu, kā CBP darbojas CD8+ atmiņas šūnu un CD8+ atmiņas atsaukšanas reakciju veidošanā. Kopā ar datiem, kas iegūti šajā mērķī2, tiks izveidots jauns mehānisms, kas izskaidro, kā tirozīnkināzes aktivitātes izmaiņas, kas saistītas ar CD8 + T šūnu atmiņas veidošanos, izraisa unikālas transkripcijas programmas.<br/><br/>Sabiedrības veselības nozīme<br/><br/>Šeit piedāvātie pētījumi noteiks, izmantojot masspektrometriju, signāla transdukcijas notikumus, kas notiek atmiņas CD8 + T šūnās pēc restimulācijas, attiecībā pret CD8 + T šūnām. Ņemot vērā, ka šīm šūnām ir būtiska loma aizsardzībā pret sekundāru infekciju, ir svarīgi izprast molekulāros mehānismus, ar kuru palīdzību šīs šūnas veic savu efektoru funkciju cilvēku veselības aizsardzībai. |
