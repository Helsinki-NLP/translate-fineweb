| Bacopa<br/><br/>19 Nov 2015<br/>Posted by Doxiderol<br/><br/>Bacopa is a perennial plant that thrives in marshy subtropical and tropical regions around the globe. The highly regarded herb is a key ingredient in Doxiderol, a nutritional supplement that enhances cognitive function. Bacopa was chosen for its ability to protect the brain and increase acetylcholine, a biochemical messenger that enables the nervous system to relay information.<br/><br/>Ayurvedic practitioners first described the therapeutic properties of bacopa in 300 BC. The physicians recorded bacopa's abilities to enhance intelligence and memory. Nearly 2,500 years later, a growing body of modern research confirms the cognitive benefits of bacopa recorded in the Ayurvedic text.<br/><br/>In 1987, researchers in India evaluated the effects of bacopa on the intellectual function of school-aged children. During the four-week study, they administered bacopa to 40 children who were 6 to 8 years old. The scientists determined that bacopa increased perception and memory. The children were able to solve maze exercises quicker and more accurately after receiving bacopa. Many parents in India routinely use bacopa to enhance their children's intellectual development.<br/><br/>A 12-week study published in the August 2001 issue of Psychopharmacology investigated the effects of bacopa on cognitive function. Scientists randomly assigned the healthy volunteers, aged 18 to 65, to receive bacopa or an inactive substance. They also used a double-blind configuration for the study to conceal the identities of the products. Researchers use this design to ensure that the test results are valid because it eliminates bias by the researchers and participants. The bacopa group experienced a significant improvement in the speed at which they were able to process visual information. The participants also learned faster and stored new memories more efficiently.<br/><br/>In 2007, a Texas A&M College of Medicine laboratory study revealed one of the mechanisms responsible for bacopa's ability to promote brain health. According to the scientists, bacopa uses polyphenols to prevent oxidative stress and the damage that it causes to healthy brain cells. Bacopa also reduces harmful deposits of a substance known as beta-amyloid, which is the primary component of the plaque in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease.<br/><br/>A double-blind study published in the July 2008 issue of the Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine evaluated the effect of bacopa on elderly patients. The study confirmed that bacopa increased cognitive performance while reducing stress. According to the authors, the benefits achieved in this study confirmed the results of earlier research.<br/><br/>A 90-day study published in the December 2008 issue of Phytotherapy Research confirms the cognitive benefits that were previously demonstrated in other bacopa studies. Bacopa significantly improved the ability of the participants to temporarily store and use information required for completing a complex task. The double-blind study also demonstrated that bacopa reduced the time required to process visual information.<br/><br/>In addition to enhancing nerve signal transmission, the scientists theorize that bacopa increases cognitive function by reducing anxiety. Numerous studies indicate that anxiety interferes with the ability to perform tasks that require higher-level cognitive functions, such as learning and memorization. Stress disrupts biochemical messengers and healthy nerve signal transmission. Bacopa alleviates stress and restores a sense of calm by increasing acetylcholine levels, which reduces your heart rate and enables you to take deeper breaths.<br/><br/>Doxiderol is a great way to obtain the benefits of bacopa. This holistic supplement also contains other natural ingredients that promote brain health and support your ability to focus and concentrate on complex task as well as memorize information. | Bacopa<br/><br/>19. nov. 2015<br/>Publisert av Doxiderol<br/><br/>Bacopa er ein flerårig plante som trivst i myrlendte subtropiske og tropiske område rundt om i verda. Den høgt respekterte urten er ein viktig ingrediens i Doksiderol, eit kosttilskudd som forsterkar kognitiv funksjon. Bacopa vart valt for si evne til å verne hjernen og auka acetylkolin, ein biokjemisk bodskap som gjer det mogleg for nervesystemet å vidareformidle informasjon.<br/><br/>Ayurvediske utøvarar skildra først dei terapeutiske eigenskapane til bacopa i 300 f.Kr. Legane registrerte bacopa sine evner til å forbetre intelligens og minne. Nesten 2500 år seinare stadfestar ein veksande mengde moderne forsking dei kognitive fordelane ved bacopa som er nedteikna i den ayurvediske teksten.<br/><br/>I 1987 evaluerte forskarar i India effekten av bacopa på den intellektuelle funksjonen til born i skulealder, og i løpet av den fire veker lange studien gav dei bacopa til 40 born i alderen 6 til 8 år. Forskarane fastslo at bacopa auka persepsjon og minne, og at borna klarte å løyse labyrintøvingar raskare og meir nøyaktig etter å ha fått bacopa. Mange foreldre i India brukar rutinemessig bacopa for å auke den intellektuelle utviklinga til borna sine.<br/><br/>Ein 12-ukers studie publisert i august 2001-utgaven av Psychopharmacology undersøkte effekten av bacopa på kognitiv funksjon. Forskarar tildelte tilfeldig dei friske frivillige i alderen 18 til 65 år til å få bacopa eller eit inaktivt stoff. Forskarar bruker dette designet for å sikre at testresultata er gyldige fordi det eliminerer skjevheter hos forskarane og deltakarane. Bacopa-gruppa opplevde ein betydeleg forbetring i kor raskt dei var i stand til å prosessere visuell informasjon. Deltakarane lærte òg snøggare og lagra nye minner meir effektivt.<br/><br/>I 2007 avslørte ein laboratoriestudie ved Texas A&M College of Medicine ein av mekanismane som er ansvarlege for bacopa sin evne til å fremme hjernehelse. I følgje forskarane nyttar bacopa polyfenolar for å hindre oksidativt stress og dei skadane det fører med seg for friske hjerneceller. Bacopa reduserer òg skadelege avleiringar av eit stoff som er kjent som beta-amyloid, som er den primære komponenten i plakket i hjernen til pasientar med Alzheimers sjukdom.<br/><br/>I ein dobbeltblind studie publisert i juli 2008-utgava av Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine, vart effekten av bacopa på eldre pasientar evaluert. Studien stadfesta at bacopa auka kognitiv yteevne og reduserte stress. I følgje forfattarane stadfesta nytten som vart oppnådd i denne studien resultata frå tidlegare forsking.<br/><br/>Ein 90-dagars studie publisert i desember 2008-utgaven av Phytotherapy Research stadfestar dei kognitive fordelane som tidlegare vart demonstrert i andre bacopa-studier. Bacopa gjorde det mogleg for deltakarane å mellombels lagre og bruke informasjon som var nødvendig for å fullføre ei kompleks oppgåve. Den dobbeltblinde studien viste òg at bacopa reduserte tida det tok å behandle visuell informasjon.<br/><br/>I tillegg til å forbetre nervesignaloverføringa, teoretiserer forskarane at bacopa aukar kognitiv funksjon ved å redusera angst. Talrike studiar indikerer at angst forstyrrer evnen til å utføre oppgåver som krev kognitive funksjonar på høgare nivå, som læring og memorisering. Stress forstyrrar biokjemiske budbringarar og sunn nervesignaloverføring. Bacopa lindrer stress og gjenoppretter ei kjensle av ro ved å auka nivået av acetylkolin, noko som reduserer hjartefrekvensen og gjer at ein kan ta djupare åndedrag.<br/><br/>Doksiderol er ein flott måte å få nytte av bacopa. Dette holistiske tillegget inneheld òg andre naturlege ingrediensar som fremmer hjernehelse og støttar din evne til å fokusere og konsentrere deg om komplekse oppgåver, samt å huske informasjon. |

She can also sense demonic auras as well as evil auras. When she was born and growing, however, her powers were sealed and she was much less powerful. Since the defeat of the one sealing her powers, Kagome has reached her full potential.<br/><br/>PURIFICATION By making a physical connection, Kagome has the ability to purify both poison and darkness from a subject (living and inanimate). To do so, she projects her spiritual powers through her hand.<br/><br/>SPIRITUAL BARRIERS With her full potential, Kagome has the ability to create a barrier around herself and expand it around others. It is a dome-shaped barrier that can destroy weak demons that make contact with the barrier.<br/><br/>IMPROVED EYESIGHT<br/>Kagome has the ability to see things that are often invisible to the human eye: ghosts, spirits, divine and evil auras.<br/><br/>ABILITIES WITH WEAPONS<br/>Kagome has the ability to use a bow and arrow. She has been self trained, and after years of practice, her arrow rarely misses its mark. Alongside this, Kagome has the ability to infuse her arrows with powers. She can infuse an arrows with her spiritual powers which allows them to penetrate demonic forces, destroy spells, and purify objects. She can infuse her bow with her powers and deflect enemy attacks. She has the ability to infuse her arrows with purifying energy to purify poison as well as powerful, long distant demonic attacks. And, finally, she has the ability to bypass others with her arrow: If her target happens to be behind a barrier or a hostage, the arrow can teleport and hit only her target<br/><br/>The rest of her abilities have become rather unimportant as they are related to time travel (through the Bone Eater's Well), the Shikon Jewel, or her previous incarnation.<br/><br/>the canon<br/><br/>Kagome has been pulled a few days after her high school graduation, however, before the Bone Eater's Well has opened again to allow her to return to the past permanently.<br/><br/>freestyle<br/><br/>memories<br/><br/>かごめ<br/><br/>The sound of her name was a soft whisper in the back of her mind, like a call muffled by the wind. It was the sound of a distant memory, a voice that she had started to forget but desperately clung to all the same. It was her mother's voice, twisted in the sorrow of her lost daughter. Afterall, Kagome banished without a trace. She vividly remembered those moments, the way the day had begun, what she had for breakfast and the last thing she had said to her mother. It was haunting, those memories, because it was like any other time she had slipped between worlds. She had woken, listless, because she had no purpose outside of school. She could find a job, and was scheduled for an interview that day. Her heart hadn't been in it, but it was what she needed to do.<br/><br/>She remembered the feeling of dread, sucking it up and giving herself a pep talk that she could do this. That she could progress in the life that she was meant to now that things had been settled in the past. Of course, she had the lingering feeling that she no longer belonged in her own time or her own life. Not with everything that she had left behind.<br/><br/>Kagome remembered the feeling of the wood beneath her fingers, the way her hand had curled into the handle to slide the door open. She remembered that she paused, turning to her mother with a bright and vibrant smile as she shook herself from her stupor. "I'm taking off." She remembered how strong her voice sounded, the smile on her mother's lips as her eyes shone with pride. Her mother bade her farewell, which didn't seem any different than before but somehow the weight of the words settled in heavier on Kagome's shoulders the more she reflected.<br/><br/>Briefly, the thoughts flickered forward, wondering if her mother worried over her, missed her like she did. Kagome could openly admit that her mother's strength, her support for the fact that her daughter slipped through time so frequently. There were times when she thought herself weak for not having the woman to lean on.<br/><br/>However, she remembered that she did muster up a meager amount of strength.She could remember the shift in the air, the temperature notably different than what she had expected, blinking at the sudden and unfamiliar surroundings. It was not her family's shrine. And when she turned to go back, to slip through the door she had come through, she was met with unfamiliar and cold metal beneath her fingertips and an interior that was not the entrance of her house. A man stood before her, behind a counter, who stared at her with eyes as wide as her own.<br/><br/>She didn't panic, at least. Being torn through time and placed in impossible situations at least built your willpower as far as strange happenings went. Because it wasn't every day that someone found themselves dragged into the past by a demon, intent on ripping a powerful jewel from their body that they didn't even know was there. And then there was the fact that she had shattered said powerful jewel into who knows how many pieces and was tasked on finding them. Such things were not normal, and she had needed to square up and roll with it once she realized that was her reality. It had seemed so simple, just gather the shards and fix the jewel.<br/><br/>But it hadn't been easy, there were many demons after the shards and the jewel itself. And one particularly powerful demon with a wish that he was determined to see fulfilled. To this day, she had never learned his wish but knew it had never been granted even once he had the blasted thing completed. He had ruined so many lives for the sake of nothing. Ruined so many lives for such a futile task. Naraku had been the most difficult foe, and the one who had been the center of everything that had gone wrong in all of her friend's lives.<br/><br/>But, it was that unpredicability, that necessity to roll with what was happening and the willpower that she had gained from her adventure that she remembered drawing upon to come up with a story that fit in the moment that didn't seem too whimsical or far fetched. She needed to be believed, she needed to survive.<br/><br/>Afterall, she faced worse than a man in a camera store. She had lied through her teeth to save her life before.<br/><br/>"I was looking for a job." In the end, it wasn't a complete lie. After all, she had set out of her house with the intent of attending a job interview. Her state of dress would at least attest to that much. It was one of the easier fibs she had ever told.<br/><br/>And, for some reason, that crazy man hired her.<br/><br/>かごめ<br/><br/>Kagomed rolled over in her bed as she pushed back the distant memories, refusing to acknowledge that she was really awake. She clawed at the last glimpses of sleep, begging it to return and to take her back into its embrace. She closed her eyes, willing sleep to come and was only met with memories. The echoes of a song sang in the distance of her memories, a song that had often tormented her, given the same name as her. The voice that sang was no longer reminiscent of her mother, but the voices of children who she had often played with growing up. They called back the memories, even though it had been years since she started this live, even though she was happy in this life, the call of these memories was too loud.<br/><br/>Suddenly, she was falling back into them and sleep evaded her again. She was watching herself in her family's embrace while Inuyasha was pulled back into the well, looking as startled as she had felt. The memories of that moment, those feelings, were still so strong. The feeling of heartbreak and sorrow welled up again though it had been so long since she had felt like she had been ripped away from everything that mattered to her.<br/><br/>Of course her family mattered, and she was happy to be in their arms again. She could never fully, truly describe how she had felt in those days. She still couldn't explain the way she felt split in two, with warring desires to be in both her past and present. She remembered the futile attempts to jump through the well, fingers clawing at the ground in a desperate plea to let her return. The first month home, she didn't sleep so much as she cried.<br/><br/>Elysion had garnished a similar reaction, though it was not so fierce because she didn't know exactly where she had slipped through nor did she know where she could worm her way back. Her explorations were subtle between working her job and trying to settle herself into this life. She had no intentions of staying, no intentions of lingering longer than she needed. And while she didn't try as fiercely as she had when she tried to return to the past, her passion was tenfold because she had no ties to this world. Because she was truly alone… With no hope of anyone to reach her.<br/><br/>In her irrational moments, she thought the Jewel had pulled her back and found a new hell for her to reside in. A new hell that would force her to make a wish, but she remembered very clearly that she had wished it gone forever. That didn't stop her dreams, the times when she woke up in the night sobbing. And those memories of her past were the hardest to deal with, the hardest to forget. Her heart began to race in a panic as she turned in her bed again, her breath became a struggle as she fought against a panic attack induced by her wandering mind this late into the night.<br/><br/>She hated feeling so weak, so afraid.<br/><br/>籠の中の鳥は<br/><br/>Kagome finally pulled herself from bed, her room lit with a pale light that was enough to guide her to the bathroom. She stood before the mirror, the sink running while she stared at her reflection. Raven colored hair covered her face and she felt as bad as she looked. Her first morning in Elysion was similar to this, only she was in worse shape.<br/><br/>She had found a place to sleep, managing to work out a deal with the owner of the building to allow her to stay a small period of time without paying. Perhaps it had been Miroku's influence that allowed her to strike such deals, as the monk was known for his way in charming (or scamming) people into giving them more than enough for the work they had done. The monk had always been that way, since they had first met. He would claim the dwelling of a lord to be haunted when it was not or, claim that they were subject to an attack when they would not be. He would sell his wards and charms for such high prices. It worked practically every time and she wondered why people had been so willing to trust him.<br/><br/>Perhaps it was his smile, or the fact that he was a monk that the people of the past were so willing to crumble. He never preyed on the weak, at least. He always did what was right and he was a symbol of strength to her at times when he would push through everything in order to do what was right. He pushed through the fact that he was dying, that he was cursed, and tried to do something about it rather than wallowing in his fate. He had pushed himself to the limit in the time leading up to their final fight. And she had been glad that they had defeated Naraku before he could become subject to the same fate as his father, and his father before him.<br/><br/>As far as her own charms went, however, she was more fair than her friend and made the deal reasonable. She doubted that anyone in this world would pay a hefty price for an exorcism or banishing demons. They were too technologically advanced for that. But she was clever enough, and smart enough, to make a good deal.<br/><br/>But now, Kagome was in a better place though the look on her face looked the same. Haunted, tired, drained...<br/><br/>A quick glance at a clock on the wall told her that she could try to sleep longer. But she opted out of that, not wanting to face the flashbacks again. She took a shower instead, using the cold water to chase away her demons, to fill her lungs with a sharp intake of breath and force herself awake.<br/><br/>いついつ出やる<br/><br/>It didn't work.<br/><br/>Not in the way she was wanting. The cold water certainly forced the air into her lungs, forced her mind to wake and muscles to seize. A bitter laugh was pulled from her lips as she tilted her head back and found herself remembering more. Today, she wasn't going to escape them so easily. She wasn't going to recover so simply, to recover just because she willed it.<br/><br/>Sometimes, there's no avoiding the thoughts you wanted to. Even when you were certain that you were past them.<br/><br/>Sango would have been a great help in this situation. The demon slayer was her best friend, she would even go as far as to call her the sister that she never had. An older sister who was wise, always had her side when trouble arose. Particularly boy trouble, when such things were rather trivial but it was fun to have a crush and for her friend to be mad on her behalf when Inuyasha made her sad. After all, it had been often that the half-demon would run to his dead lover's side and break her heart more than once.<br/><br/>But, Sango also inspired her in other ways. After all the woman had faced, she had always been so strong, so sure... Even in the times that she had doubted herself, she always pulled through. She admired that she had the ability to survive after losing her whole family -- the reminder of this often pushed Kagome to survive, because she lost everyone to this world -- and then having her brother become a pawn of Naraku. It wasn't easy, couldn't have been something to that just anyone could face and still go forward with. She still smiled, even with that pain and those reminders... She was often so bright, even in the darker times.<br/><br/>And right now, she wanted to lean into the older woman's side, to take comfort in the fact that she was there and she was supportive. She felt that Sango would somehow pull through this, and offer some words of strength and understanding. It was times like these that made these spells worse, the constant reminder that she was without her family.<br/><br/>"I don't want to be alone." She cried aloud in her solitude, the sound of the shower drowning out the plea.<br/><br/>She wasn't afraid to admit it.<br/><br/>夜明けの晩に<br/><br/>Another hour had slipped by before she had realized it. Her skin was cold from the water and it felt like ice ran through her veins. She hadn't realized she had begun to shiver until her hand reached to turn off the water and end her shower. Kagome didn't seek her own gaze in the mirror again, instead, she wrapped herself in towels and trudged out of the bathroom, up the stairs and into her kitchen. She started on making a light breakfast, idly reading through her notes for the day as the food cooked.<br/><br/>Her career was really taking off these last years. Her photos were featured in many galleries, her name started to frequent many lips for those who were interested in photography.<br/><br/>The job she had asked for on a whim had sparked it all. She had been far more lucky than she had expected to be in this world. Never lucky enough to slip back through the cracks into her own world, but lucky enough to do well. As she turned back to the stove, she remembered the time she had finally given up on returning home. It was about two years into her life here, as she had started to venture into photography as more than just a hobby but something she could make a name for herself with.<br/><br/>That day had been particularly pleasant, the sun was high in the sky and she had found herself taking some photos of the natural scenery. A little boy had hidden in one of the plants, and she had caught a picture of the moment his face had settled into a cheerful, mischievous grin the moment before he had jumped out to startle his prey. It reminded her of Shippou, the little kitsune she had, essentially, adopted. He, too, had been torn from his family when they had first met. His father killed and he was determined to avenge him. While young, he did seem so mature in their first encounters.<br/><br/>Maybe it had been the influence of Inuyasha that allowed the kit to act like a kid again, to be young and whimsical at times while others he was more mature. He offered comfort to her in his own way, and she tried to care for him as she would her own though she had been so young then as well. However, her youth did not stop her from understanding how to tend to him or care for him like her child. Her heart swelled when he smiled, when he had been so happy for his gift of crayons and took the time to make art. She was so proud of each drawing that he had finished that she knew that this was how a mother would feel in such a situation.<br/><br/>The pain that had ripped through her was too much, too sudden. She missed him and wanted to see how much he had grown since she had been gone. She had missed so much...<br/><br/>To spare herself any further pain, any false hopes… She gave up. And focused on bettering herself.<br/><br/>鶴と亀が<br/><br/>Breakfast tasted bland, boring, and inspired. Only after she had finished did she realized she had forgotten to any sort of spices or flavor to the food. It was too late now to remember that much, as her mind was too busy remembering other details of her life that clearly had become more important than her food.<br/><br/>"Sit!"<br/><br/>Of course, nothing happened when she had angrily yelled at one particularly frustrating client that reminded her of the half-demon. He was being particularly stubborn and rude, wanting a photo taken his way rather than letting it work out naturally. You could try to force wild animals to behave how you wanted. But, rarely did anyone succeed with force. Inuyasha wasn't as bad, however. Inuyasha had learned before she had been forced away from him. He had become gentler, more understanding, more mature though there were times he was still childish and cocky.<br/><br/>She remember how red her cheeks had burned, but how she stood her ground and fired him. She told him she refused to work for anyone or with anyone who wanted to twist something beyond it's nature, beyond it's own desires.<br/><br/>She should have compared the man to Naraku rather than Inuyasha. Though her client did not have such extreme intentions. At least the feeling afterwards was a pleasant memory. The freedom of knowing that she had come so far that she could refuse work that she didn't want to do, to be her own person that was independent of others. She could say that she made it at that point. Even though she heard rumors days later with words meant to slander her.<br/><br/>She defended herself righteously, like she did towards the end of her journey. After all, she was the only one who could protect herself in this world.<br/><br/>滑った<br/><br/>Morning light began to creep into her home, reminding her again of the passage of time. Again, she considered the list of things she had to do and debated on where to start. Or, if she should even start at all. With how the day began, she didn't know if she could consider that a great idea. It was doubtful that she would be successful with how lost in herself she was becoming.<br/><br/>She didn't want to mess up her latest work. Because she had done that on a few occasions before. It wasn't pleasant to try and recover from a complete disaster.<br/><br/>Kagome remembered the feeling of her expensive, brand new, camera slipping from her hands. She wasn't prepared to support it, because she had just removed it from her bag. Part of her screamed on the inside. A dramatic, over-the-top, full on scream that she frequently did when she was much, much younger. When she was struggling to make it through middle school while hopping between times. The other part of her had remained frozen in place while her lense completely shattered and the rest of the camera had broken along with it.<br/><br/>Seeing Inuyasha's brother, a full demon, standing before her was the last thing she expected when she had made her way out for her photos. He stood as proud as ever, as tall as ever, as imposing as she remembered. He didn't look fazed at all to be in an entirely different world, though she was never the best at reading his mind. His name on her lips was so potent, that she could remember the tiniest feelings as she did. Her lips were chapped, her mouth felt dry, and the bubbling feeling of anxiety in her stomach made her feel sick.<br/><br/>She didn't want her hopes to be up.<br/><br/>But, she wanted him to be there, even if they were not friends. They were allies, if anything, since they had fought side by side. And something was better than absolutely nothing.<br/><br/>And Kagome had the sense enough not to throw herself at him, to wrap her arms around him in relief that knowing she was not alone. Her camera no longer mattered when she approached him. She remembered that nothing else mattered for days as she spent time with him, not speaking of their world but speaking (or, she was speaking and he simply acknowledged that fact).<br/><br/>When, exactly, she fell for him though… Kagome couldn't recall. It was a subtle thing, just like he was. But she knew the feeling was there. And he let her know that she was not alone in the fact that she had fallen, that feelings had somehow blossomed.<br/><br/>後ろの正面<br/><br/>A feeling of weightlessness overtook her and suddenly her eyes opened while her mind desperately clawed for the last thing she was doing. She didn't recall when she had fallen asleep on her couch, but she knew the last place she had been was on the far too comfortable cushions. She didn't struggle, however, or fight the weightlessness as she was in familiar arms. Her head tilted against Sesshoumaru's chest, taking comfort in the fact that he was here and she wasn't alone.<br/><br/>"Welcome back." His response was a soft hum in acknowledgement. He didn't need to speak much for her to understand his intent, or the rest of what he had to say.<br/><br/>He carried her back to her bed, settled her into it with ease. Her eyes met his and she smiled easily because no more memories drifted back, no more recollections teased at her. No, whenever he was near, she never fell back into those thoughts. He had helped, and the years had helped. Today was just… One of those days.<br/><br/>"Sleep." He commanded with ease, her eyes rolled at him but she did not fight because she was tired. Her hand clung tightly to him, while she felt his opposite hand press to her forehead in assessment of her wellbeing.<br/><br/>"I'm okay," she said, her words firm with her promise.<br/><br/>She was okay. She was alive. And she was happy.<br/><br/>だあれ<br/><br/>shipper<br/><br/>summary<br/><br/>Kagome, at one point in her life, was a rather regular teenage girl until she was attacked by a demon inside her family's well house. The demon dragged her down into the well, which magically transported her about 500 years into the past. There, she learned that a sacred jewel was encased inside her body as she was the reincarnation of a priestess that had died 50 years prior to the time she was dragged into. The jewel was ripped from her body and the demon that dragged her through time was defeated by the half-demon that she freed who was pinned to the tree. Kagome befriended the half-demon, Inuyasha, in time and traveled with him to restore the jewel that she, herself, shattered. Though it was not so straightforward and easy to do as many demons and humans sought the jewel for their own purposes. She befriended a young kitsune demon, a monk, and a demon slayer who all traveled with her to restore the jewel.<br/><br/>Her group, however, was not the one to complete the jewel. Instead, an evil half-demon who manipulated the majority of the major events in most of her companion's lives. When he finally collected all the pieces of the jewel and made his wish on the tainted object, Kagome was drawn into the jewel itself with the intent of her making a selfish wish to keep her trapped inside forever, keeping the jewel alive. It was the stubbornness of Inuyasha that managed to save her from the darkness. In the end, she returned to her natural time, finished high school as was expect from a girl of her timeline. Though days later, Kagome ended up in Elysion. She has been in this world for five years, and has long since given up on returning home. She's settled happily into her new life.<br/><br/>platonic<br/><br/>It's rather easy for Kagome to make new friends, she hasn't changed much from her youth. She is a cheerful young woman who is empathetic and welcoming to most of all in her life. In her youth, she befriended demons when most would fear them. Even demons that used to eat humans, she has befriended and she changed their ways (she'd like to think). This being said, it's really easy to become her friend as long as someone is able to shown that they are willing to be redeemed, or show that they are not completely evil. She feels greatly for everyone she meets, so it's hard for her not to be drawn to others in a desire to be friends.<br/><br/>antagonistic<br/><br/>The only way to earn Kagome's wrath is to be so deplorable, so evil, and so far beyond redemption that she can't see any good in you. And she can see the good in pretty much everyone and everything. Honestly, with whom she has faced? A half-demon that pitted two lovers against each other, that cursed the entire male line of one of her friends, and then had her best friend's brother kill their family… Yeah, I don't see her hating anyone without them really, really working for it. Feel free to give it a shot, though.<br/><br/>romantic<br/><br/>When in love, Kagome is a strong support, always staying there even when things may be rough. However, Kagome is not looking for love, wasn't looking for love when she arrived so any past relationships don't exist. This isn't to say that someone hasn't fallen in love with her. She can definitely be the subject of someone's unrequited love, she'll probably be oblivious about it, though. Finally, Kagome is currently engaged to Sesshoumaru, surprisingly. I'm totally open to potential AU things, though. <3<br/><br/>fandom hell<br/><br/>age ancient<br/><br/>species space queen<br/><br/>occupation dying<br/><br/>prefers she/her<br/><br/>awards<br/><br/>pro<br/>she/her est 62woo i suck at plot replies. but ok anyway!!! neptune is very friendly and has that 'cool' persona, he's really fun to be around, and he's SUPER good to work with. like he's super patient and he'll do anything she asks of him--he's really easy to work with, definitely in comparison to other models. so i love the idea of them being all work oriented friends at first and then turning into something more. neptune definitely tries to surround himself with people, because he loves having friends, and kagome is pretty much his type too? like she's sweet and she's a strong woman, and he is actually better friends with women than he is with men, idk why, he just loves being surrounded by female friends who knows. i love my guys being super good friends and protecting their girl friends honestly. but oh M A N i love pseduo-family type relationships and neptune is an only child, so he hasn't had any like, familial relationships like that. so her looking out for him all big sister like would make him be like ????? cause he's confused but also he actually really likes that LOL! they're both good kids, i think they'd be really fun ^^<br/><br/>fandom fire emblem: fates<br/><br/>age ninteen<br/><br/>species Part human / part dragon<br/><br/>occupation representative guardian<br/><br/>prefers she/her<br/><br/>awards<br/><br/>yonder<br/>she/her aest 20 posts<br/><br/>I haven't seen Inuyasha at all but... from what I've read Kagome seems to be one of those people who might be able to help Corrin out with her emotional state. There's a lot weighing on her mind since she had to fight her birth family against her will and last time she saw them they all pretty much hated her. Frankly she hasn't worked through everything yet since she was essentially at the head of a full-scale war. I feel they could be friends as Corrin is quite open in her personality, extremely trusting as well. She's just... hiding and struggling through a lot.

I love your idea of Kagome taking a pic of Elsa! You know, she's also a singer/performer at a local theater so I can imagine Kagome going there to scope things out and then catching Elsa backstage or something--and then the friendship could blossom from there!

Ho kan òg kjenna demoniske auraar så vel som vonde auraar. Men då ho vart fødd og voks, vart kreftene hennar forsegla og ho var mykje mindre mektig, og sidan nederlaget til den eine som forsegla kreftene hennar, har Kagome nådd sitt fulle potensial.<br/><br/>Ved å gjere ei fysisk tilknyting, har Kagome evna til å reinsa både gift og mørke frå eit subjekt (levande og livlause). For å gjere det, projiserer ho sine åndelege krefter gjennom handa si.<br/><br/>Med sitt fulle potensiale har Kagome evne til å skape ein barriere rundt seg sjølv og utvida den rundt andre. Det er ein kuppelforma barriere som kan øydeleggje svake demonar som får kontakt med barrieren.<br/><br/>Forbetra augesyn<br/>Kagome har evna til å sjå ting som ofte er usynlege for menneskeauget: spøkelse, åndeskapingar, guddommelege og vonde auraer.<br/><br/>Moglegheiter med våpen<br/>Kagome har evna til å bruka pil og boge. Ho har vore sjølvlært, og etter mange år med øving misser pila sjeldan merket sitt. I tillegg har Kagome evna til å infundera pilene sine med krefter. Ho kan bruka åndelege krefter til å bringa inn deimoniske kreftene, øydeleggja trolldom og reinsa gjenstandar. Ho kan bruka bua si til å avverga fiendlege åtak. Ho har evna til å infuse pilene sine med reinskande energi for å reinsa så vel gift som kraftige, lange, fjerne demoniske angrep. Og til slutt har ho moglegheita til å omgå andre med pila si: Viss målet hennar tilfeldigvis er bak ein barriere eller eit gissel, kan pila teleportere seg og berre treffe målet hennar.<br/><br/>Resten av evnene hennar har blitt ganske uviktige sidan dei er knytt til tidsreiser (gjennom Bone Eater's Well), Shikon Jewel, eller hennar tidlegare inkarnasjon.<br/><br/>kanonen<br/><br/>Kagome har vorte trekt ut nokre dagar etter at ho vart uteksaminert frå high school, men før Bone Eater's Well har opna igjen slik at ho kan gå tilbake til fortida for godt.<br/><br/>fristil<br/><br/>Minn<br/><br/>かごめ<br/><br/>Lyden av namnet hennar var ein mjuk hvisking i bakhovudet, som eit kall dempa av vinden, det var lyden av eit fjernt minne, ei stemme som ho hadde byrja å gløyme, men desperat klamra seg fast til alt det same. Det var mora si stemme, forvrengt i sorga til den bortkomne dottera si. Etterpå forviste Kagome utan spor. Ho hugsar klart dei stundene, korleis dagen hadde byrja, kva ho hadde til frukost og det siste ho hadde sagt til mora. Dei minnene var haunting, fordi det var som alle andre gongar ho hadde glidd mellom verder. Ho hadde vakna opp, sløv, fordi ho ikkje hadde noko føremål utanfor skulen. Ho kunne finne ein jobb, og var planlagt for eit intervju den dagen. Hjartet hennar hadde ikkje vore med, men det var det ho måtte gjere.<br/><br/>Ho tenkte på skrekken, sugde den opp og gav seg sjølv ein peptalk om at ho kunne gjere dette, at ho kunne gå framover i det livet ho var meint å no som ting var blitt avgjort i tidlegare tider. Sjølvsagt hadde ho ei dvelande kjensle av at ho ikkje lenger høyrde til i si eiga tid eller i sitt eige liv, ikkje med alt ho hadde etterlate seg.<br/><br/>Kagome hugsa kjensla av veden under fingrane, korleis handa hennar hadde krølla seg inn i handtaket for å gli døra open. Ho hugsa at ho tok ein pause, og snudde seg mot mor si med eit lyst og levande smil medan ho rista seg ut av stuporen. "I'm take off." Ho hugsa kor sterk stemma hennar høyrdest ut, smilet på leppene til mora hennar medan augene hennar skinte med stolthet. Mora tok avskjed med henne, noko som ikkje såg noko annleis ut enn før, men på ein eller annan måte tyngde orda tyngre på skuldra til Kagome jo meir ho reflekterte.<br/><br/>I korte trekk flimra tankane framover og lurte på om mora var uroa over henne, og mangla henne slik ho gjorde. Kagome kunne ope innrømme at mora si styrke, støtta hennar for at dottera hennar glei gjennom tida så ofte. Det var tider då ho tenkte seg svak for at ho ikkje hadde kvinna å lene seg på.<br/><br/>Men ho hugsa at ho hadde samla opp ei lita mengd krefter, og ho kunne hugsa endringa i lufta, temperaturen som var særs forskjellig frå det ho hadde venta, og blunka til dei brå og uvante omgjevnadane. Då ho snudde seg for å gå tilbake, for å skli gjennom døra ho hadde kome gjennom, vart ho møtt av uvant og kaldt metall under fingertuppane og eit interiør som ikkje var inngangen til huset hennar. Ein mann stod framfor henne, bak ein skranke, og stirde på henne med auge like breie som sine eigne.<br/><br/>Ho fekk iallfall ikkje panikk, for ho vart riven gjennom tida og plassert i umoglege situasjonar, i det minste bygde ho opp viljestyrken din så langt som det rare skjedde. Fordi det ikkje var kvar dag at nokon fann seg dratt inn i fortida av ein demon, med sikte på å rive en kraftig juvel fra kroppen sin som dei ikkje enno visste var der. Og så var det det faktum at ho hadde knust sa kraftig juvel inn i den som veit kor mange bitar og var oppgåve på å finne dei. Slike ting var ikkje normale, og ho hadde trengt å firkante opp og rulle med det når ho skjønte at det var hennar virkelighet. Det hadde verka så enkelt, berre sanka fragmenta og fiksa juvelen.<br/><br/>Men det var mange vonde ånder i dei når dei kjem, og dei vonde åndene har stor makt over dei. Det eine ønsket er å få sjå alt det andre. For ho hadde ikkje fått det ho ønskte, men det det ho fekk, det hadde ho òg fått. For det hadde ho alt fått for, og sjølv òg for det unyttige arbeidet sitt, det livet ho no har fått. Naraku hadde vore den vanskelegaste fienden, og den som hadde vore sentrum for alt som hadde gått gale i alle venene sine liv.<br/><br/>Men det var den uforutsigbarheten, den naudsynte rolla med det som skjedde og viljestyrken ho hadde fått frå eventyret sitt som ho hugsa å dra på for å kome fram til ei historie som passa i det augneblinket som ikkje verka for lunefull eller langt henta. Ho trengde å bli trudd, ho trengde å overleve.<br/><br/>Etter alt saman, møtte ho verre enn ein mann i ein kamerabutikk, ho hadde løytt gjennom tennene sine for å redde livet sitt før.<br/><br/>"Eg var på utkikk etter ein jobb." Til slutt var det ikkje ei fullstendig løgn. Tross alt hadde ho gått ut av huset sitt med den hensikt å delta på et jobbintervju. Tilstanden til kjolen hennes ville i det minste vitne til så mye. Det var ein av dei lettare fibene ho nokon gong hadde fortalt.<br/><br/>Og av ein eller annan grunn leia den gale mannen henne.<br/><br/>かごめ<br/><br/>Kagomed rulla seg attende i senga medan ho dytta attende dei fjerne minnea sine, og nekta å erkjenne at ho verkeleg var vaken. Ho klatra til dei siste glimta av søvnen, og bad henne om å koma attende og ta henne med seg attende inn i favnen sin. Ho lukka augo, var villig til å sovne og vart berre møtt av minnene. Ekkoet av ein song song i det fjerne av minnene hennar, ein song som ofte hadde plaga henne, gjeve same namn som ho. Stemmen som song, minna ikkje lenger om mora, men røystene til born som ho ofte hadde spelt med i oppveksten. Dei kalla tilbake minnene, sjølv om det hadde gått år sidan ho starta dette live, sjølv om ho var glad i dette livet, var kallet på desse minnene for høgt.<br/><br/>Ho såg seg sjølv i favnen til familien sin, medan Inuyasha vart trekt ned i brønnen og såg like skremd ut som ho hadde følt seg. Minnene frå den tida, desse kjenslene, var framleis så sterke, kjensla av hjartekval og sorg vart oppkvikka igjen, sjølv om det hadde vore så lenge sidan ho hadde følt at ho hadde vorte rive vekk frå alt som betydde noko for henne.<br/><br/>Sjølv om ho og heile huslyden hennar var så kjær, vart ho glad når ho kom att, for ho kunne ikkje fortelja korleis ho hadde hatt det på den tida. Ho kunne framleis ikkje forklara korleis ho følte seg delt i to, med stridande lyster til å vere i både fortida og notida. Ho hugsa dei fåfengte forsøka på å hoppe gjennom brønnen, medan fingrene kløyvde i bakken i ein desperat bøn om å la henne koma tilbake. Den første månaden heime sov ho ikkje så mykje som ho gret.<br/><br/>Elysion hadde pynta seg med ein liknande reaksjon, sjølv om ho ikkje var så hard fordi ho ikkje visste nøyaktig kor ho hadde glidd gjennom, og heller ikkje kor ho kunne orme vegen tilbake. Utforskinga hennar var subtil mellom å jobbe jobben sin og å prøve å slå seg til ro i dette livet. Ho hadde ingen intensjonar om å bli verande, ingen intensjonar om å bli verande lenger enn ho trengde. Og medan ho ikkje prøvde så hardt som ho hadde gjort då ho prøvde å gå tilbake til fortida, vart lidenskapen hennar tidobla fordi ho ikkje hadde noko band til denne verda, fordi ho var verkeleg åleine... utan håp om at nokon skulle nå fram til henne.<br/><br/>I sine irrasjonelle stunder trudde ho at juvelen hadde trekt henne tilbake og funne eit nytt helvete for henne å bu i. Eit nytt helvete som ville tvinge henne til å lage eit ønske, men ho hugsa veldig klart at ho hadde ønskt at det var borte for alltid. Det stoppa ikkje draumane hennar, tida då ho vakna i natta si, og dei minnene frå fortida hennar var vanskelegare å handtera, vanskelegare å gløyma. Hjartet hennar byrja å rase i panikk då ho snudde seg i senga igjen, pusten hennar vart ein kamp då ho kjempa mot eit panikkanfall indusert av det vandrande sinnet sitt så seint på natta.<br/><br/>Ho hata å kjenna seg så svak, så redd.<br/><br/>籠の中の鳥は<br/><br/>Kagome drog seg til slutt opp av senga, rommet hennar lyste med eit bleiklys som var nok til å føre henne til badet. Ho stod framfor spegelen, vasken sprang medan ho såg på refleksjonen sin. Ravens farga hår dekte ansiktet hennar og ho følte seg like dårleg som ho såg ut. Den første morgonen hennar i Elysion likna denne, berre ho var i dårlegare form.<br/><br/>Ho hadde funne ein stad å sova, og klarte å få til ein avtale med eigaren av bygningen slik at ho kunne bu ei lita stund utan å betale. Kanskje var det Miroku si påverknad som gjorde at ho kunne slå slike avtalar, ettersom munken var kjend for sin veg i sjarmerande (eller svindlende) folk til å gje dei meir enn nok for arbeidet dei hadde gjort. Munken hadde alltid vore slik, sidan dei først hadde møtt. Han ville hevde at bustaden til ein herre var hjemsøkt når det ikkje var det, eller hevde at dei var utsett for eit angrep når dei ikkje ville være. Han ville selje avdelingane sine og sjarmen sin for slike høge prisar. Det fungerte praktisk talt kvar gong og ho lurte på kvifor folk hadde vore så villige til å stole på han.<br/><br/>Kanskje var det smilet hans, eller det at han var munk at folk i tidlegare tider var så villige til å smuldre. Han gjorde alltid det som var rett og han var eit symbol på styrke for henne til tider då han ville presse gjennom alt for å gjere det som var rett. Han pressa seg gjennom det faktum at han var døyande, at han var forbanna, og prøvde å gjere noko med det i staden for å velte seg i skjebnen sin. Han hadde pressa seg til det ytterste i tida fram mot den endelege kampen deira. Og ho hadde vore glad for at dei hadde slått Naraku før han kunne bli utsett for same skjebne som far sin, og far sin før han.<br/><br/>Når det gjeld sjarmen hennar, var ho likevel meir rettferdig enn veninna og gjorde avtalen rimeleg. Ho tvilte på at nokon i denne verda ville betale ein heftig pris for ein eksorsisme eller for å drive ut deimonar. Dei var for teknologisk avanserte til det. Men ho var smart nok, og smart nok, til å gjere ein god avtale.<br/><br/>Men no var Kagome på ein betre stad, sjølv om utsjånaden i ansiktet hennar såg likedan ut. Spøkt, sliten, drenert...<br/><br/>Eit raskt blikk på ei klokke på veggen fortalde henne at ho kunne prøve å sove lenger, men ho valde bort det, og ville ikkje møte flashbacks igjen. Ho tok i staden ein dusj, og brukte det kalde vatnet til å jage bort deimonane sine, for å fylle lungene med eit skarpt pust og tvinga seg til å vakna.<br/><br/>いついつ出やる<br/><br/>Det fungerte ikkje.<br/><br/>Ikkje på den måten ho ønskte. Det kalde vatnet pressa visstnok lufta inn i lungene hennar, tvinga sinnet hennar til å vakna og musklane til å gripe. Ein bitter latter vart trekt frå leppene hennar medan ho bøygde hovudet bakover og fann seg sjølv hugsande meir. I dag kom ho seg ikkje unna dei så lett, ho kom seg ikkje så lett att, berre fordi ho ville.<br/><br/>Av og til kan du ikkje unngå dei tankene du har lyst til, sjølv om du var sikker på at du kom til å tenkja på dei før.<br/><br/>Sango ville ha vore til stor hjelp i denne situasjonen. Demonmordaren var hennar beste venn, hun ville til og med gå så langt som å kalle henne den søstera som hun aldri hadde hatt. En eldre søster som var klok, hadde alltid sin side når det oppsto problemer. Særleg gutteproblem, når slike ting var nokså trivielle, men det var morosamt å ha eit crush og for veninna å bli galen på hennar vegne då Inuyasha gjorde henne trist. Det hadde etter alt å døme ofte vore at halvdemonen ville springe til den daude kjærasten sin og knuse hjartet hennar meir enn ein gong.<br/><br/>Men Sango inspirerte henne òg på andre måtar, for etter alt ho hadde møtt, hadde ho alltid vore så sterk, så sikker... Sjølv i dei tida ho hadde tvilt på seg sjølv, hadde ho alltid klart seg. Ho beundra at ho hadde evna til å overleve etter å ha mista heile familien - påminninga om dette pressa ofte Kagome til å overleve, fordi ho mista alle til denne verda - og så hadde broren hennar blitt ein bonde av Naraku. Det var ikkje lett, kunne ikkje ha vore noko som berre kven som helst kunne møte og framleis gå vidare med. Ho smilte framleis, sjølv med den smerten og dei påminningane... Ho var ofte så lyssterk, sjølv i mørkare tider.<br/><br/>Og akkurat no ville ho lene seg inn i den eldre kvinna si side, for å trøste seg med at ho var der og ho var støttende, og ho følte at Sango på ein eller annan måte ville klare dette, og tilby nokre ord av styrke og forståing. Det var tider som desse som gjorde desse forbanningane verre, den stadige påminninga om at ho var utan familien sin.<br/><br/>"Eg vil ikkje vera åleine." Ho ropa høgt i einsemda si, lyden av dusjen drukna ut bøna.<br/><br/>Ho var ikkje redd for å innrømme det.<br/><br/>夜明けの晩に<br/><br/>Ein annan time hadde gått før ho hadde innsett det. Huda hennar var kald frå vatnet og det føltes som om is rann gjennom venene hennar. Ho hadde ikkje innsett at ho hadde byrja å skjelve før handa hennar nådde fram for å slå av vatnet og ende dusjen. Kagome søkte ikkje sitt eige blikk i spegelen igjen, i staden pakka ho seg inn i håndklær og gjekk ut av badet, opp trappa og inn på kjøkkenet. Ho byrja med å laga ein lett frukost, medan ho las gjennom notata for dagen medan maten kokte.<br/><br/>Karrieren hennar tok verkeleg av dei siste åra. Bileta hennar vart vist i mange galleri, og namnet hennar byrja å få mange lippar for dei som var interesserte i fotografering.<br/><br/>Jobben ho hadde bedt om på eit innfall hadde utløyst alt. Ho hadde vore langt heldigare enn ho hadde venta å vere i denne verda. Aldri heldig nok til å gli tilbake gjennom sprekkene inn i sin eigen verden, men heldig nok til å gjere det bra. Då ho snudde seg mot komfyren, hugsa ho den tida ho til slutt hadde gjeve opp då ho kom heim att. Det var om lag to år inn i livet hennar her, ettersom ho hadde byrja å våge seg inn i fotografering som meir enn berre ein hobby, men noko ho kunne skape seg eit namn med.<br/><br/>Den dagen hadde vore særs hyggeleg, sola stod høgt på himmelen og ho hadde funne seg sjølv ta nokre bilete av det naturlege landskapet. Ein liten gut hadde gøymt seg i ein av plantane, og ho hadde teke eit bilete av augneblinken då ansiktet hans hadde lagt seg til ro i eit muntert, rampete smil augneblinken før han hadde hoppa ut for å skremja byttet sitt. Det minte henne om Shippou, den vesle kitsunen ho i røynda hadde adoptert. Han hadde òg vorte rive frå familien då dei først møttest. Faren hans drap han og han var fast bestemt på å hevne han. Medan han var ung, verka han så moden i dei første møtene deira.<br/><br/>Kanskje hadde det vore påverknad frå Inuyasha som gjorde at kiten kunne opptre som eit kid igjen, å vere ung og lunefull til tider medan andre han var meir moden. Han trøysta henne på sin eigen måte, og ho prøvde å trøysta han på same måten som ho hadde gjort med barnet sitt. Men den unge kvinna lét seg ikkje trøysta av å gjera med barnet sitt. Hjarta hennar hovna opp då han smilte, då han hadde vore så glad for gåve av blyantar og tok seg tid til å lage kunst. Ho var så stolt av kvar teikning han hadde gjort at ho visste at det var slik ei mor ville føle seg i ein slik situasjon.<br/><br/>Smerten som hadde gått gjennom henne var for mykje, for brått. Ho sakna han og ville sjå kor mykje han hadde vakse sidan ho var borte. Ho hadde gått glipp av så mykje...<br/><br/>For å spare seg for meir smerte og falske forhåpningar gav ho opp og fokuserte på å bli betre.<br/><br/>鶴と亀が<br/><br/>Frokosten smakte blid, kjedelig og inspirert, men først etter at ho var ferdig innsåg ho at ho hadde gløymt alle krydder og smakar til maten. Det var for seint no å hugsa så mykje, då sinnet hennar var for oppteke med å hugsa andre detaljar i livet hennar som tydelegvis hadde blitt viktigare enn maten hennar.<br/><br/>"Sitt!"<br/><br/>Sjølvsagt skjedde det ingenting då ho hadde ropt sint på ein særs frustrerande klient som påminte henne om halvdemonen. Han var særs sta og uhøfleg, og ville ha eit bilete tatt på hans måte i staden for å la det fungere naturleg. Du kunne tvinga ville dyr til å oppføra seg som du ville. Men det var få som klarte det med makt. Men Inujasja var ikkje så ille, for ho hadde lært før ho vart tvinga bort frå han. Han var blitt mildare, meir forståande og meir moden, sjølv om han stundom framleis var barnsleg og cocky.<br/><br/>Ho hugsar kor raude kinna hennar hadde brunna, men korleis ho stod på bakken og sparka han. Ho fortalde han at ho nekta å arbeide for nokon eller med nokon som ville vri noko bortanfor naturen, bortanfor sine eigne lyster.<br/><br/>Ho skulle ha samanlikna mannen med Naraku i staden for Inuyasha, sjølv om klienten hennar ikkje hadde så ekstreme intensjonar. I det minste var kjensla etterpå eit triveleg minne. Fridomen til å vite at ho hadde kome så langt at ho kunne nekta å arbeide som ho ikkje ønskte å gjera, å vere sin eigen person som var uavhengig av andre. Ho kunne seie at ho gjorde det på det tidspunktet. Sjølv om ho høyrde rykte nokre dagar seinare med ord som var meint å sverte henne.<br/><br/>Men no, i desse siste dagar, har han tala til oss i rettferd og gått til grunne i all æve.<br/><br/>滑った<br/><br/>Morgenlyset tok til å krype inn i huset hennar, og minna henne igjen om tida som hadde gått. Igjen vurderte ho lista over ting ho måtte gjere og diskuterte kvar ho skulle starte, eller om ho i det heile tatt skulle starte. Med korleis dagen byrja, visste ho ikkje om ho kunne tenkje på det som ein god ide, det var tvilsamt om ho ville ha suksess med kor fortapt ho i seg sjølv var i ferd med å bli.<br/><br/>Ho ville ikkje gjera noko gale med arbeidet sitt, for det hadde ho gjort nokre gonger før, og det var ikkje godt å bli frisk av heile kroppen.<br/><br/>Kagome hugsa kjensla av det dyre, splitter nye kameraet som skled ut av hendene hennar. Ho var ikkje førebudd på å støtte det, fordi ho nettopp hadde fjerna det frå veska si. Delar av henne skrek på innsida. Ei dramatisk, over-the-top, full av skrik som ho ofte gjorde når ho var mykje, mykje yngre, når ho strevde med å kome seg gjennom ungdomsskolen medan ho sprang mellom tider. Den andre delen av henne hadde vore frosen på plass medan linsa hennar var heilt knust og resten av kameraet hadde brote saman med henne.<br/><br/>Å sjå broren til Inuyasha, ein full demon, stå framfor henne var det siste ho venta då ho hadde gjort seg klar til å fotografere. Han stod så stolt som nokon gong, så høg som nokon gong, så imponerande som ho hugsar. Han såg ikkje ut til å vere i ei heilt anna verd, sjølv om ho aldri var den beste til å lese sinnet hans. Namnet hans på leppene hennar var så sterkt at ho kunne hugsa dei minste kjenslene som ho gjorde. Leppene hennar var sprukne, munnen hennar var tørr, og den boblende kjensla av angst i magen gjorde henne sjuk.<br/><br/>Ho ønskte ikkje at håpa hennar skulle vere opp.<br/><br/>No ville ho gjerne ha han hos seg, men ho var ikkje god til å forlika seg med han. For dei hadde stridd mot han og stridd mot han, og han var ikkje god til å forlika seg med dei.<br/><br/>Og Kagome hadde kjensle nok til ikkje å kaste seg mot han, til å vikle armane sine rundt han i lettelse over at ho ikkje var åleine. Kameraet hennar hadde ikkje lenger noko å seia då ho kom bort til han. Ho kom i hug at ho ikkje hadde noko anna å seia enn at ho i fleire dagar var saman med han. Ho snakka ikkje om verda, men om verda (eller, ho snakka, og han vedkjende seg ganske enkelt det faktum).<br/><br/>Men akkurat då ho fall for han... Kagome kunne ikkje hugsa det. Det var ein subtil ting, akkurat som han var. Men ho visste at kjensla var der. Og han let henne få vita at ho ikkje var åleine om at ho hadde falle, at kjensla på ein eller annan måte hadde blomstra.<br/><br/>後ろの正面<br/><br/>Ei kjensle av vektløyse kom over henne, og brått opna auga hennar medan ho fortvila kløyvde for det siste ho gjorde. Ho kunne ikkje hugsa når ho hadde sovna på sofaen, men ho visste at den siste staden ho hadde vore var på dei altfor komfortable putene. Ho streva ikkje, eller kjempa mot vektløysa som ho var i kjende armar. Hodet hennar vippa mot brystet til Sesshoumaru, og tok trøst i at han var her og ho ikkje var åleine.<br/><br/>"Velkommen tilbake." Svaret hans var eit mildt hum i erkjenning. Han trengde ikkje å snakke så mykje for at ho skulle forstå intensjonen hans, eller resten av det han hadde å seie.<br/><br/>Han bar henne tilbake til senga hennar, slo henne ned i henne med letthet. Øyna hennar møtte han og ho smilte lett fordi ingen fleire minnen driv tilbake, ingen fleire erindringar ertet på henne. Nei, når han var nær, fall ho aldri tilbake i dei tankene. Han hadde hjelpt, og åra hadde hjelpt, og i dag var berre ein av dei dagane.<br/><br/>Han sa: « Søv du? » Men ho sleit i auga, svara han, og han bøygde seg djupt og kasta seg ned for føtene hans.<br/><br/>"Eg har det bra", sa ho, orda hennar var faste med løftet sitt.<br/><br/>Ho hadde det bra, ho levde, og ho var glad.<br/><br/>だあれ<br/><br/>avsendar<br/><br/>oppsummering<br/><br/>Kagome var på eit tidspunkt ei ganske vanleg tenåringsjente før ho vart angripe av ein demon inne i brønnhuset til familien sin. Demonen drog henne ned i brønnen, som på magisk vis frakta henne om lag 500 år tilbake i tid. Der fekk ho vite at ein heilag juvel var innkapsla i kroppen hennar ettersom ho var reinkarnasjonen av ei prestinne som hadde døydd 50 år før ho vart slept inn. Juvelen vart rive frå kroppen hennar og demonen som drog henne gjennom tida vart slått av halvdemonen som ho frigjorde som var festa til treet. Kagome vart ven med halvdemonen, Inuyasha, i tide og reiste med han for å gjenopprette juvelen som ho sjølv knuste. Sjølv om det ikkje var så enkelt og lett å gjere som mange demonar og menneske søkte juvelen for sine eigne føremål. Ho vart ven med ein ung kitsune-demon, ein munk og ein demondrepar som alle reiste med henne for å gjenopprette juvelen.<br/><br/>Men gruppa hennar var ikkje den som fullførte juvelen, men ein vond halvdemon som manipulerte dei fleste store hendingane i livet hennar. Då han til slutt samla alle bitane av juvelen og gjorde ønskjet sitt på det forureina objektet, vart Kagome trekt inn i sjølve juvelen med den føremål å gjere eit egoistisk ønskje om å halde henne fanget inni seg for alltid, og halde juvelen i live. Det var staleiken til Inuyasha som klarte å redde henne frå mørket. Til slutt kom ho attende til naturtida si, og fullførte vidaregåande skule som ein hadde venta av ei jente frå tidslinja si. Men nokre dagar seinare enda Kagome opp i Elysion. Ho har vore i denne verda i fem år, og har for lenge sidan gitt opp å reise heim, og har slått seg ned i det nye livet sitt.<br/><br/>platonisk<br/><br/>Det er lett for Kagome å få nye vener, ho har ikkje forandra seg mykje sidan ho var ung. Ho er ei munter ung kvinne som er empatisk og gjestfri mot dei fleste i livet sitt. I ungdomen vart ho venn med deimonar når dei fleste ville frykta dei. Til og med deimonar som før åt menneske, har ho blitt vener og ho har endra åtferda deira (hun ønskjer å tenkje). Når det er sagt, er det veldig lett å bli venn med henne så lenge nokon er i stand til å vise at dei er villige til å bli løyst, eller vise at dei ikkje er helt onde. Ho føler sterkt for alle ho møter, så det er vanskeleg for henne å ikkje bli tiltrukket av andre i eit ønske om å vere venner.<br/><br/>antagonistisk<br/><br/>Den einaste måten å fortjene Kagomes vreide på er å vere så avskyeleg, så vond og så hinsides forsoning at ho ikkje kan sjå noko godt i deg. Og ho kan sjå det gode i stort sett alt. Ærleg talt, kven har ho møtt? Ein halvdemon som sette to elskarar opp mot kvarandre, som forbanna heile den mannlege slekta til ein av venene sine, og så fekk bestevenninna si bror til å drepe familien deira... Ja, eg ser ikkje at ho hatar nokon utan dei verkeleg, verkeleg arbeidar for det. Gjerne gi det eit forsøk, skjønt.<br/><br/>romantisk<br/><br/>Når ho er forelska, er Kagome ei sterk støtte, som alltid er der for å hjelpe, sjølv når ting kan vere tøft, men Kagome er ikkje på jakt etter kjærleiken, ikkje var på jakt etter kjærleiken då ho kom dit, så alle tidlegare forhold eksisterer ikkje. Dette er ikkje å seie at nokon ikkje har forelska seg i henne. Ho kan definitivt vere gjenstand for nokons ubesvarte kjærleik, ho vil truleg vere uvitande om det. Til slutt er Kagome forlova med Sesshoumaru, overraskande nok. Men eg er heilt open for potensielle AU-ting. <3<br/><br/>fandom hell<br/><br/>eldgammal<br/><br/>artsromdronning<br/><br/>okkupasjon døyr<br/><br/>føretrekk ho/han<br/><br/>prisar<br/><br/>Men ok uansett!!!

Neptune prøver definitivt å omgi seg med folk, fordi han elskar å ha venner, og kagome er stort sett hans type òg? som ho er søt og ho er ei sterk kvinne, og han er faktisk betre ven med kvinner enn han er med menn, idk kvifor, han elskar berre å vere omringa av kvinnelege vener som veit.

Ærleg talt, ho har ikkje arbeidd gjennom alt enno sidan ho hovudsakleg var i spissen for ein fullskala krig.

Du veit, ho er òg ein songar/performer på eit lokalt teater så eg kan tenkje meg at Kagome går dit for å undersøke ting og så ta Elsa bak scenen eller noko -- og så kunne venskapen blomstre derifrå!

| Why You Should be on Twitter<br/><br/>Disclaimer: I am not, nor have I ever claimed to be, a social media guru. I'm just a person who thinks about stuff a lot, and this has come up a number of times.<br/><br/>I'm not an early adopter. Sometimes it takes me years to figure out what I want to use something for before I actually get on it, and Twitter was one of those things. I've been on Twitter seriously since about February of this year, so I'm pretty new at it. Still, I've learned a number of things, and I wanted to share them. Some people say I'm a Twitter pusher, and I am, because there's lots of good reasons to get on it, and virtually no downsides.<br/><br/>So what's Twitter? If you're on the internet, you've probably at least heard of it. It's a social media network that serves as a forum for conversations, updates, and news in a medium more public than something like Facebook or LinkedIn. Facebook is about who wants to find you, but Twitter is about who you want to find. Your favourite writers, actors, politicians, singers, and scientists are probably on Twitter. So are your favourite charities, radio stations, news sites, and stores. And they want you to find them and listen to what they have to say. Everyone on Twitter, at least initially, wants to talk with you.<br/><br/>But why join that? Why be a part of it? There's all kinds of reasons, and I'm going to give you a few.<br/><br/>People and Places Twitter is a great way to find out about events which are going on around the world, but also in your community. If you're travelling and looking for things to do, it's a great way to find out about things relevant to your interests (because the people you follow are people you're interested in). Even if you're not travelling, knowing about great places to go locally or knowing that people you're interested in are going to them creates an opportunity to meet them and create a deeper relationship with them. If you go back to my party post, all the people in it but two, I heard about on Twitter and then met in real life, and now we're pretty good friends. And the more you do this, the more things you'll find out about, and the more people you'll meet. And if you follow them on Twitter, you already know a bit about what they're like. They want you to. The reverse is also true, because tweeting invites people to see what you're like, and they can make the same choices about you.<br/><br/>Inspiration and Motivation<br/>Inspiration comes from the strangest places, and the influx of tweets means there's always fresh content for your imagination. I have a follow first policy, so I'll follow just about anybody, and then periodically go through and unfollow people. I don't know who's going to plant the seed of a new blog post or new project in me, so I like to keep my options open. Motivation also happens, because Twitter is just like life. If you surround yourself with people who are ambitious, dedicated, generous, and hard-working, it's easier to be like that, and push yourself. It's easier to think that if they can plan events, launch projects, or just get up in the morning, well, so can you.<br/><br/>Learning and Lifestyle Bloggers are on Twitter. Bloggers who aren't may actually be crazy. And people blog about just about everything. If you're looking to learn something, odds are good that somebody's tweeting about it. On top of that, news services and stores are also connected, which means that you can get your news up to the minute, and find out about sales and deals as they start.As far as lifestyle, looking for new recipe ideas? Follow some caterers and see what they come up with. Need a twist for that cocktail party? Twitter's got people for that too. Wardrobe recommendations, or just want to see what other people are doing with their lives? It's all there.<br/><br/>There are some common challenges I face when talking about this, and they're legitimate obstacles. It can seem pretty daunting, especially if you're getting on the bandwagon late, like I did. I spent months following only two people and not knowing what else to do. But there are ways to overcome them, and hear they are from least frequent to most.<br/><br/>#3: Twitter is for Narcissistic Jerks<br/>I think this comes from the idea that most people tweet for and about themselves as a way of getting attention. What I don't get is why there's anything wrong with that, or why doing that makes one a narcissist or a jerk. If someone has something to say, they want to be heard. Used to be you'd stand on the street corner and yell. Now you can yell in 140 characters or less. Twitter's just a new way to be heard. Now, there are certainly narcissistic jerks on Twitter. They're pretty much everywhere. Sometimes, people are jerks. Sometimes one of those people is me, I'm sorry to say. Don't follow those people. If you don't like what someone is saying, whether that's points that they're making or detailed accounts of their bathroom activities, you don't have to listen on Twitter.<br/><br/>#2: I Can't Keep Track of It All<br/>The second obstacle people often bring up is that they just don't have time to keep track of all the things which are going on on Twitter. And you know what? That's fine. Keep track of what you can. Maybe you only wander on every few days. If you're a private user (rather than tweeting for your company), and especially a beginner, that's okay. Part of something is better than all of nothing.<br/><br/>#1 I've Got Nothing I Want to Put Out There<br/>This is by far the most frequent challenge people raise. And it doesn't even matter. You don't have to join Twitter to talk. Join it to listen. Again, your favourite authors, singers, bloggers, and newspapers are on here. This is your chance to listen to them. It's your chance to gain a window into their lives and activities, and they're inviting you to do that. Want to find out what Felicia Day is going to be up to at the San Diego Comic Con? Done. I know people who only listen on Twitter, and that's great. That's what I did for a while. Eventually, maybe you'll find something to tweet about, or make something to tweet about. I hope you do, because I want to hear about it.<br/><br/>In short, if you're not using Twitter, I think you should be. If you're not using it to its full extent, try to. Don't be afraid to follow five hundred people, if all of those people are saying things you're interested in. Invite those people into bits of your life, and see how it's improved by the interaction. I look forward to hearing from you. | Kvifor du bør vere på Twitter<br/><br/>Disclaimer: Eg er ikkje, og har aldri sagt eg er, ein guru for sosiale media. Eg er berre ein person som tenkjer mykje på ting, og dette har kome opp fleire gonger.<br/><br/>Eg er ikkje ein tidleg adopter. Av og til tek det meg fleire år å finne ut kva eg vil bruke noko til før eg faktisk kjem på det, og Twitter var ein av dei tinga. Eg har vore på Twitter seriøst sidan om februar i år, så eg er ganske ny på det. Likevel, eg har lært ei rekkje ting, og eg ønskte å dele dei. Somme seier at eg er ein Twitter-pusher, og det er eg, fordi det er mange gode grunnar til å kome på det, og praktisk talt ingen ulemper.<br/><br/>Så kva er Twitter? Dersom du er på nettet, har du sikkert i det minste høyrt om det. Det er eit sosialt nettverk som fungerer som eit forum for samtalar, oppdateringar og nyhende i eit medium som er meir offentleg enn noko som Facebook eller LinkedIn. Facebook handler om kven som vil finne deg, men Twitter handler om kven du vil finne. Favorittskribentane, skodespelarane, politikarane, songane og vitskapsmennene dine er truleg på Twitter. Det same er favorittane dine for veldedige organisasjonar, radiostasjonar, nyheitsnettstader og butikkar. Og dei vil at du skal finne dei og lytte til kva dei har å seie. Alle på Twitter, i det minste i starten, vil snakke med deg.<br/><br/>Men kvifor vil de vera med på det? Det kan vere mange grunner til det. Eg skal gje dykk nokre.<br/><br/>Folk og stader Twitter er ein fin måte å finne ut om hendingar som skjer rundt om i verda, men òg i nærmiljøet ditt. Dersom du er ute og reiser og ser etter ting å gjere, er det ein fin måte å finne ut om ting som er relevante for dine interesser (fordi folka du følgjer er folk du er interessert i). Sjølv om du ikkje er på reise, kjenner til flotte stader å reise til lokalt eller veit at folk du er interessert i kjem til dei, skaper det ei moglegheit for å møte dei og skape eit djupare forhold til dei. Om du går tilbake til festposten min, alle andre enn to, eg høyrde om han på Twitter og møtte han i det verkelege livet, og no er me ganske gode vener. Og jo meir du gjer dette, jo fleire ting vil du finne ut om, og jo fleire folk du vil møte. Og viss du følgjer dei på Twitter, veit du allereie litt om korleis dei er. Dei vil ha deg til å gjere det. Det omvendte er òg sant, fordi tweeting inviterer folk til å sjå korleis du er, og dei kan gjere dei same vala om deg.<br/><br/>Inspirasjon og motivasjon<br/>Inspirasjonen kjem frå dei mest underlege stader, og tilstrømningen av tweets betyr at det alltid er nytt innhald for fantasien din. Eg har ein regel først, så eg vil følgje omtrent alle, og så med jamne mellomrom gå gjennom og slutte å følge folk. Eg veit ikkje kven som skal planta frøa til eit nytt blogginnlegg eller prosjekt i meg, så eg likar å halde vala mine opne. Motivasjon skjer òg, fordi Twitter er akkurat som livet. Viss du omgjev deg med menneske som er ambisiøse, engasjerte, sjenerøse og hardtarbeidande, er det lettare å vere slik, og presse deg sjølv. Det er lettare å tenkje at om dei kan planlegge hendingar, starte prosjekt, eller berre stå opp om morgonen, vel, det kan du også.<br/><br/>Learning and Lifestyle Bloggers er på Twitter. Bloggarar som ikkje er det, kan faktisk vere gale. Og folk bloggar om omtrent alt. Dersom du er ute etter å lære noko, er oddsen god for at nokon tvitrar om det. På toppen av det er også nyheitstenester og butikkar tilkopla, noko som betyr at du kan få nyheitene dine opp til minuttet, og finne ut om sal og avtale når dei startar. Følg nokre cateringfirma og sjå kva dei finn på. Treng du ein vri på det cocktailpartyet? Twitter har folk til det også. Garderobeanbefalingar, eller vil du berre sjå kva andre folk gjer med liva sine? Det er alt der.<br/><br/>Det er nokre vanlege utfordringar eg møter når eg snakkar om dette, og dei er legitime hindringar. Det kan verke ganske skummelt, særleg om du kjem for seint på toget, som eg gjorde. Eg har følgt dei i mange månader og ikkje funne noko anna å gjera enn å høyra på dei. For det er så mange som står der, og dei spør etter meg.<br/><br/>#3: Twitter er for narsissistiske rasshøl<br/>Eg trur dette kjem av ideen om at folk flest kvitrer for og om seg sjølve som ein måte å få merksemd på. Det eg ikkje forstår er kvifor det er noko galt med det, eller kvifor det gjer ein til ein narsissist eller ein idiot. Om nokon har noko å seie, vil dei bli høyrde. Før ville du stå på gatehjørnet og skrike. No kan du skrike med 140 teikn eller mindre. Twitter er berre ein ny måte å bli høyrd på. No er det sikkert narsissistiske idiotar på Twitter. Dei er nesten overalt. Av og til er folk idiotar. Av og til er ein av dei meg, sorry, følg ikkje etter dei. Om du ikkje likar det nokon seier, om det er poeng dei gjer eller detaljerte skildringar av badeaktivitetane sine, treng du ikkje å lytte på Twitter.<br/><br/>#2: Eg kan ikkje halde styr på alt<br/>Det andre hinderet folk ofte fører opp er at dei berre ikkje har tid til å halde styr på alt som skjer på Twitter. Og veit du kva? Det er greitt. Hald styr på kva du kan. Kanskje du berre vandrar på nokre få dagar. Viss du er ein privat brukar (i staden for å kvitre for firmaet ditt), og spesielt ein nybegynnar, så er det greitt. Delar av noko er betre enn ingenting.<br/><br/>#1 Eg har ikkje noko eg vil leggja ut der<br/>Dette er den deisidert mest vanlege utfordringa folk reiser. Og det spelar ingen rolle. Du treng ikkje å vere med på Twitter for å snakke. Bli med på Twitter for å lytte. Igjen, favorittforfattarane dine, songarar, bloggarar og aviser er her. Dette er din sjanse til å høyre på dei. Dette er din sjanse til å få eit vindauge inn i liva deira og aktivitetane deira, og dei inviterer deg til å gjere det. Ønskjer du å finne ut kva Felicia Day kjem til å gjere på San Diego Comic Con? Ferdig. Eg kjenner folk som berre høyrer på Twitter, og det er flott. Det var det eg gjorde ei stund. Etter kvart vil du kanskje finne noko å tweeta om, eller lage noko å tweeta om. Eg håpar du gjer det, for eg vil gjerne høre om det.<br/><br/>Kort sagt, viss du ikkje brukar Twitter, så trur eg du bør gjere det. Viss du ikkje brukar Twitter fullt ut, prøv å gjere det. Ikkje ver redd for å følgje fem hundre personar, viss alle desse personane seier ting du er interessert i. Inviter dei inn i bitar av livet ditt, og sjå korleis det blir forbetra av samhandlinga. Eg ser fram til å høyra frå deg. |
| Root Canals<br/><br/>The very thought of getting a root canal puts most people on edge. SCM Dental utilizes the latest technology and technique to make a root canal a virtually pain free and low stress procedure.<br/><br/>Rotary endodontics is an advanced technology and technique to perform endodontic treatment, the clinical term for a root canalThe term "root canal" refers to the natural cavity at the center of the tooth. The tooth's nerve is located in soft tissue (pulp) inside the root canal. If the tooth is damaged either by trauma or decay, debris can enter the sensitive root canal area and cause an infection, or in extreme circumstances, and abscess. An abscessed tooth is very serious and should be treated as an emergency, as it can create an infection that may spread to other parts of the body. If you believe you have an abscessed tooth, contact our office immediately to schedule emergency care.<br/><br/>Depending on the case, root canal therapy may require more than one visit. An initial x-ray will be taken to evaluate the tooth and root canal and determine the extent of the damage and infection if present. You will be given a form of anesthesia to make you relaxed.<br/><br/>When the area is numb, our dentist will create an access chamber to the root canal using an electric handpiece. Next, the root canal will be scraped of the infected or damaged tissue and nerve. Once the entire area has been throughly cleaned and polished, the tooth will be filled with a biocompatible rubber compound called gutta percha. The tooth is then covered with a dental filling or dental crown to restore strength and function.<br/><br/>Endodontic therapy has a bad reputation as being a painful procedure. With rotary endodontics, a root canal procedure is no more painful than having a dental filling placed. The infection and damage to the nerve is what creates the extreme pain and discomfort and patients you will experience significant relief after undergoing root canal therapy. Root canals have a success rate of 95% and allow people to preserve their natural teeth. | Rotkanalar<br/><br/>SCM Dental nyttar den siste teknologien og teknikken for å gjere ein rotkanal til ein tilnærma smertefri og lågstressa prosedyre.<br/><br/>Roterende endodontikk er ein avansert teknologi og teknikk for å utføre endodontisk behandling, det kliniske uttrykket for ein rotkanalUttrykket «rotkanal» viser til det naturlege hulrommet i midten av tannen. Tannnerven er lokalisert i bløtvev (pulpa) inne i rotkanalen. Dersom tannen er skada anten av traume eller forfall, kan restar gå inn i det sensitive rotkanalområdet og forårsake infeksjon, eller i ekstreme tilhøve, og abscess. Ein abscessert tann er svært alvorleg og bør handsamast som ei nødsituasjon, då det kan skape ein infeksjon som kan spreie seg til andre delar av kroppen. Dersom du trur du har ein abscessert tann, kontakt kontoret vårt med ein gong for å avtale akuttbehandling.<br/><br/>Røntgen vil bli tatt for å vurdere tannen og rotkanalen, og for å avgjere kor stor skaden og infeksjonen er dersom dei er til stades. Du vil få ei form for anestesi for å gjere deg avslappa.<br/><br/>Når området er numment, vil tannlegen lage eit tilgangskammer til rotkanalen ved hjelp av eit elektrisk handstykke. Deretter vil rotkanalen skrapast av det infiserte eller skadde vevet og nerven. Når heile området har vorte grundig reinsa og polert, vert tannen fylt med ein biokompatibel gummiblanding kalla gutta percha. Tannen vert så dekt med ein tannfylling eller tannkrone for å gjenopprette styrke og funksjon.<br/><br/>Endodontisk terapi har eit dårleg rykte som ein smertefull prosedyre. Med roterande endodontikk er ein rotkanalprosedyre ikkje meir smertefull enn å ha ein tannfylling plassert. Infeksjonen og skaden på nerven er det som skapar den ekstreme smerte og ubehag og pasientane vil oppleve betydeleg lindring etter å ha gjennomgått rotfyllingsterapi. Rotkanalar har ein suksessrate på 95 % og gjer at folk kan ta vare på dei naturlege tennene sine. |
| Churchyard Bottom Wood<br/><br/>Highgate<br/><br/>Churchyard Bottom Wood, Highgate<br/><br/>Now called Queen's Wood<br/><br/>Between 1860 and 1880 the centre was torn out of the City of London to build sewers, railways and new roads. Houses were demolished without regard for the tenants who had to find whatever accommodation they could elsewhere. Managers went to livo in Kensington and St. John's Wood, while the poorest crowded into the rookeries like Seven Dials and Lisson Grove. For those between, the clerks and skilled workmen, speculative builders put up row after row of terraced villas and Mr Pooter moved into Holloway. The people of Muswell Hill watched houses creep across the fields of Finsbury Park, up Crouch Hill and down the other side, so that by 1880, Crouch End was being developed and there seemed no way to stem the flow. Ten years later the large estates of Muswell Hill were being sold. Upton Farm was sold and the Ecclesiastical Commissioners wanted to develop Churchyard Bottom Wood, now called Queen's Wood. The story would have made an Ibsen play. Two groups of honest, highly motivated people fighting for what they each thought was right. The Ecclesiastical Commissioners on the one hand and the Committee of the Hornsey Charities on the other, both believed they were doing their best for other people, and the public rose against them both in indignation<br/><br/>At that time Muswell Hill Road was a country road, with Southwood Hall at one end and Upton Farm at the other. By 1894, Onslow Gardens was built, Connaught Gardens marked out, and builders were poised to develop the Woodlands estate. Cut out of Churchyard Bottom Wood was a group of tumble-down cottages, on a triangular site. An undated map, held by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners shows six Wasteland Cottages with an opening between them - not a road, not metalled, but a way through to the strawberry beds behind. Further along was another gap which led to footpaths through the wood. These two openings were to be the basis of the plan. The same two gaps and the cleared ground, which was the strawberry field, can be seen in the 1894 map below. They are shown as 'Muswell Hill Cottages' and, quite in passing, Peter Sellers was to live on the same site much later on. To develop the wood as a housing estate, the Commissioners needed to drive two roads through from Muswell Hill Road and build houses along them. The Muswell Hill Road frontage alone would not have provided room for enough houses to make the venture worthwhile.<br/><br/>The land and cottages had been given much earlier as almshouses to house old people and were held on their behalf by the Trustees of the Hornsey Charity Commissioners. By the 1890s the cottages were tumble-down, in need of major repair. Public-spirited, wishing to do the best for their old tenants, the Trustees could not improve them since they had no money. Some years before the Ecclesiastical Commissioners had planned to develop Gravel Pit Wood (now Highgate Wood) as a housing estate, but this had met such opposition that they backed down. Instead, in 1886, they gave all 69 acres woodland to the public. At the same time they offered to sell Churchyard Bottom Wood to Hornsey Urban District Council for £25,000, but this was too much for Hornsey to raise on its own. The Council said that people living outside Hornsey also enjoyed the wood and other authorities should help, but no help was given. In the end the offer fell into abeyance.<br/><br/>Map showing the Muswell Hill Cottages which were the centre of the controversy.<br/><br/>Muswell Hill Road about 1880<br/><br/>It seems probable that these three pairs of cottages<br/>were the ones at the centre of the dispute.<br/><br/>The Ecclesiastical Commissioners wanted to raise money for its church work in Britain and abroad. They considered that they had been given the land to be used for the propogat­ion of religion and if this meant selling off land or woods, it was a lesser evil than restricting the work of the church. They had given Gravel Pit Wood to the public: in its place they would develop Churchyard Bottom Wood.<br/><br/>The Trustees of the Hornsey Charities wanted to produce an income to help their poor people, so they made an offer to the Commissioners. Their triangular piece of land was too awkwardly shaped to be developed economically, but if the Commissioners would grant them some more land to make it into a square site, they would build twenty-five neat villas. These would bring in ground rents of £225 per annum, which could be used to relieve the poverty of Hornsey people. In return they would permit the Commission­ers to cut two roads through their land so that the Commissioners could develop the woods.<br/><br/>When this offer became known people immediately reacted with alarm.<br/><br/>On the 16th December 1893 Mr Carvell Williams MP asked in the House of Commons, if the Ecclesiastical Commissioners had consented to sell a strip of land to the Hornsey Charities Trustees on condition that an existing road be widened to 40 feet, whether this was a preliminary to a building scheme and if the House of Parliament would have an opportunity to express an opinion.<br/><br/>Mr Leveson Gower, a Church Estates Commissioner replied',"Yes" to the first part.<br/><br/>Mr Carvell Williams, "Do I understand it is the intention to destroy that portion of Highgate Woods by building on it?"<br/><br/>Two days later The Star published an article worthy of any modern tabloid.<br/><br/>The Star<br/>18th December 1893<br/><br/>'Parliament must keep a keen watch on those old vandals and confederates of the jerry-builder the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. They are always alienating some piece of land or are favouring the builders as opposed to the general public. The Commissioners would not sell the Churchyard Bottom wood to the ratepayers but now propose 'to open it up' by cutting two wide roads through it in connection with one of their numerous building schemes. Will not someone ask a question in Parliament and check the brick and mortar policy of the Commissioners?'<br/><br/>By the time this was printed, the question had been asked and the answer was either untrue, or devious. Other papers took up the story. The Times, in a long report, said that the Comnussioners were not prepared to give an undertaking that Parliament, or any other public body, should have an opportunity of considering any scheme for building on the site of the wood.<br/><br/>The situation simmered for eighteen months until the Ecclesiastical Commissioners were forced to open an enquiry, which began at Highgate on 31 May 1895, chaired by an Assistant Ecclesiastical Commissioner. The Inquiry produced a flurry of newspaper letters of which this was the most important.<br/><br/>The Daily Chronicle, 5 June 1895<br/><br/>VANDALISM AT HIGHGATE<br/><br/>Sir –<br/><br/>One of the most lovely bits of woodland in suburan London is threatened. Will you help us to ward off what would be a calamity, not only to the immediate district, but to the whole of densely-populated North London? In no part of the metropolis has the builder been more active than in Crouch End and Hornsey. The beautiful meadows of a year or two ago are now houses and shops. Ballast heaps have taken the place of stately elms and chestnuts, and once pleasant villages are sharing the fate of Stroud Green, Harringay, Finsbury Park, Highbury and Islington. ---<br/><br/>---- The object is the construction of two forty-foot roads through the woods. We in this district know the meaning of forty-foot roads through woods. It means that the woods are doomed. Ten years ago agitation saved the sister-wood of sixty-five acres - The Gravel Pit Woods - and no one who saw the Bank Holiday crowds flocking up the Archway Road from the dreary streets of Holloway, Islington and Clerkenwell, and watched the keen enjoyment of the children and family parties picnicking on the grass and among the trees, could fail to realise the immense boon that the grant by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners of this wood has been to the whole of North London, but the Lower Wood of sixty acres has always been regarded as a natural complement of the other. ----<br/><br/>--- The Ecclesiastical Commissioners own nearly one-third of the large parish of Hornsey. By the liberal expenditure of the ratepayers' money in the opening up of roads and the general development of the district, the value of their property has been enormously increased, and from this unearned increment they each year draw large revenues. Surely the ratepayers whose money has thus aided in creating the immense estate may expect liberal treatment in return. ---<br/><br/>Yours obediently,<br/><br/>Signed by The Vicar of St James', Muswell Hill, the Minister of Park Chapel, Crouch End, a barrister living in Onslow Gardens and three members of the District Council.<br/><br/>It was a shot right across the bows of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. Their own religious leaders and the District Council, all up in arms saying in effect that the church was too rich and should be charitable, not greedy. The inclusion of the two clergymen was a shrewd move. Remember to that this was still in the height of the Darwin controversy. Darwin had split belief in the teachings of the Church and many people would have resented the power of the Church from that point of view alone. The Church was not so secure as it pretended to be.<br/><br/>The Evening News, 7 June 1895 said:-<br/><br/>"If the Ecclesiastical Comnussioners are not tackled at once, the building octopus will get a grip of the wood which will be very difficult to loosen later on, ---. Therefore it behoves Londoners to be up and doing if they would save one of their most delightful bits of rustic scenery. The public inquiry stands adjourned to Thursday next, and before then something must be done to convince the Commissioners that the citizens of London will not tolerate the confiscation of one of their favourite playgrounds."<br/><br/>A letter in the Daily Chronicle the next day said:-<br/><br/>.... It was with great relief that that the residents, some ten years ago, heard that the purchase of the Upper Wood had been effected; and how delightful a boon this has proved, anyone who visited them can testify, but all who exerted themselves to save these upper woods, which lie on the west side of Muswell Hill road, felt that their victory was incomplete so long as the sixty acres on the east side remained in danger. It is, as it were, an accident that the woods are divided by a broad high road. Can anyone doubt what the effect would be if the Churchyard Bottom Wood were replaced by rows of small villas, each sending out its contribution of smoke and soot? Can anyone doubt, too, the serious difference it would make to the picturesque setting of the purchased woods if a line of staring new houses were to be run up right over against their leafy frontage?'<br/><br/>This expressed the opinions of many people. In fact, the Gravel Pit Wood, which the writer calls the 'Upper Wood', had not been purchased, but given to the district by the Ecclesiastical Commission, a point they were to reiterate time and again over the years, but most people ignored it. The Commission was not going to give away a second wood whatever anyone said, and held this position to the end.<br/><br/>H.S.Chamberlain, of 5 Cranley Gardens,<br/>in a letter to the Times dated June 8, 1895, urged purchase.<br/><br/>I know that it is common to speak harshly of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, but as the trustees of a fund they are bound to administer it to the greatest advantage, and therefore, if anything is to be done to save the demolition of the wood, it appears to me that it can only be effected by the purchase of the property from the Comnussioners, who I know, are fully alive to the protection of free and open spaces for the people, and who, I feel sure, would be disposed to treat the matter of a purchase in a free and liberal spirit, as they have already done in the matter of the Shepherd's Cot-field, by granting a lease to the Crouch End Playing-fields Company - a small company in which I own a few shares, a small company which was formed exclusively for the purpose of securing the fields for cricket, tennis etc.<br/><br/>(This refers the the Crouch End Playing Fields which had been secured a few years later.)<br/><br/>As Chairman of the Muswell Hill Conservative Association, I am constantly in touch with the inhabitants, and I can safely affirm that every person resident in the neighbourhood would do anything in reason to preserve.<br/><br/>(All he wanted personally was Charity income to support his poor people. He demanded his acre of land - not a great deal surely - he believed the Commissioners' assurance that the wood was not in danger.)<br/><br/>' Muswell Hill Road was one of the best in Hornsey and would remain equally beautiful, houses or no houses',<br/><br/>(and then came the great rhetorical flourish.)<br/><br/>'Are the poor to suffer because of the sentimental objections and the hysterical cry of 'wolf just raised by your correspondents? Something must be done and that soon. An acre of back-land added to the charity-estate would make no apprec­iable difference to the land remaining, while the profit derived from it would succour many poor old and deserving persons in their declining years and enable us to hand over to our successors an estate which in the distant future would be of great value in the rendering of charitable aid to the deserving poor of the parish of Hornsey.'<br/><br/>Reading his letter one senses hysteria very near the surface. Why did he think the Commissioners wanted to build a road? Why should they spend all that money if not to build houses? He never seemed to realise that for an acre of land the the whole wood would be lost. But he had been with the problem for a long time. He was the person to whom the Commissioners had made the offer of sale for £25,000 years before and it is his name which is honoured in a plaque on Crouch End Clock Tower for saving the wood, but his trust in the Ecclesiastical Commissioners seems naive. It is sad that at the Inquiry he was to be cast as the devil.<br/><br/>The Inquiry Continued<br/><br/>The adjourned opened in Highgate on 15 June 1895. Expecting a large gather­ing, the Council Chamber had been changed completely. The usual tables had been removed and the room filled with chairs. By half past seven the room was crowded, with people jostling for seats.<br/><br/>Mr Murray, the Commissioner, said the Inquiry was really a simple one. Hornsey Parochial Charities wished to purchase a piece of land adjoining their charity property at the back. The question was whether the Charity Commission, which controlled all charities, had enough power to stop them. The Church Commissioners were prepared to sell the land at very favourable terms and the income of the Charity would be very considerable increased.<br/><br/>Against this there were three classes of objection.<br/><br/>The original Trust was for the purpose of providing cottages for the Poor, but the trustees were proposing to build villas which would be too expensive for the Poor. However, it was within the power of the Trustees to vary the terms of the Trust, so they could build villas if they thought that the Poor would benefit in the end. The poor people themselves might object, but liberal provisions had already been promised for them. The third objection related to the aesthetic and public side of the question. He took it from what he had read that the Charity Commission ought to interfere to prevent the Ecclesiastical Commissioners from exercising their own discretion in dealing with their own property.<br/><br/>The Inquiry discussed fine points, but the speakers kept coming back to the major problem of preventing any destruction of the wood. The Vestry Clerk of Islington, representing 300,000 people, made a formal protest about any part of the wood, so valuable for the people of Islington and Hornsey being used for private purposes. Mr Wilfred White said that if the Commissioners would give them time they would be able to raise the money to compensate the Trustees.<br/><br/>Mr Beaumont said they did not want villas, they wanted cottages for poor people who were being driven out of the district. Others said that there was no money to build cottages to replace the present delapidated ones but villas would be an economic proposition. Others retorted that there were score of villas to let in Highgate. The Wood was sacred. Stick to the question of the Wood.<br/><br/>Dr Fletcher said the cry among the working people was that there was nowhere to go. Working people came to him with the cry, "We are driven out of Highgate and are obliged to go to Highgate New Town." If the Muswell Hill Road frontage was sold there was no question but that roads might be cut right through the woods in the direction of Hornsey, but if the Commissioners could not get the land from the Charity Commission they could not cut the road.<br/><br/>He was very sure the cottages could be put into a fit state of repair. He was asked by the poor people, by the police and by a number of the working classes to represent these two points, that cottage accommodation was very sorely needed in Highgate and that if they once allowed the land to be sold, there was no telling where the hand of the builder would be stayed.<br/><br/>(Loud and prolonged cheers).<br/><br/>Numerous other people spoke and the Comnussioner summed up by saying that he took it that the prevailing opinion was in favour of retaining the cottages but the meeting should draw no conclusions from what he had said (Groans).<br/><br/>Others said that the Trustees of the Charity had failed in their duties by letting the the cottages fall into disrepair.<br/><br/>Mr H.R.Williams, the Trustee who had written to the paper earlier, said that he had it on the best authority that the Church Commissioners would make no roads whatever and they would not be benefitted one iota by the actions of the Charity Commissioners. Others were far less trusting and the meeting closed after nearly three hours.<br/><br/>'We are faced with the fact that in Highgate and Muswell Hill there are a number of persons who want the Churchyard Bottom Wood and will not be happy until they have got it - while nobody appears willing to spend a farthing to pay for it. Everyone says it would be a fine thing to have the wood as open space, but everybody thinks it is the duty of someone else to make it one. The Islington Vestry has 'resolved' on the subject, but the Islington Vestry does not offer a penny piece towards the purchase. --- There is no more difficult problem for the community or the individual to solve than how to gain possession of other people's property without paying for it.'<br/><br/>Paying for it was indeed the problem as Churchyard Bottom Wood became the subject of intense local and national debate. A joint committee was formed to raise money to save the wood. On 20 November 1896, C.F.Cory-Wright, Hon Treasurer, wrote to The Standard, a daily paper at that time, appealing for help. He reminded everyone of the danger of losing the wood and said it could only be saved by buying it. The Church Commissioners would sell for £25,000 and an extra (5,000 would be required for fencing and drainage, making a total of £30,000. This was too much for Hornsey Council to raise but they had already voted £10,000 towards the total. The woods were of inestimable value to all of North London so he appealed to public bodies and private people to raise the remaining £20,000. He warned that the present offer from the Church Commissioners was open only to the end of 1898. After that the builders would move in.<br/><br/>The appeal was warmly welcomed by the press. A Private Bill was rushed through Parliament and the Highgate Woods Preservation Act, 1897, became law. The Conunittee now had the right to advertise for contributions towards buying the Wood and preserving it.<br/><br/>In a fairly short time almost all the money was raised, but the last few thousand proved very difficult to raise and the Commissioners' deadline was a matter of weeks away. Mr Cory-Wright wrote pleading for more time but was granted a mere three months and then only if interest at 4 per cent was paid for the extra period on the full sum. In the end the London County Council, which had originally offered £2,500, made this up to £5,000 and the total was reached, but it was a close-run thing.<br/><br/>The Council decided to re-name the Wood as 'Queen's Woods' in honour of Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee and Hornsey put on a fine display of bunting when the Duchess of Albany formally declared the Wood open 'for the free use of the public for ever'.<br/><br/>While the campaign to save Churchyard Bottom Wood was run and directed by local people who felt passionately about this particular piece of woodland, they called on the help and experience of a vast network of people, some of whom had worked together on similar campaigns for over thirty years. The Committee issued an appeal, printed on very good quality paper and bearing some famous names.<br/><br/>The questions of open space and public health were major subjects of the Victorian vision.<br/><br/>The Open Spaces Movement<br/><br/>Octavia Hill, the great housing reformer, who had begun with three old houses in Marylebone, bought for her by Jolm Ruskin, had quickly become an expert on housing poor people in the healthiest conditions possible. Her way was to buy leases and then knock down some of the crowded houses in order to bring light and air to the rest, believing that fresh air and sunlight were the the only way poor people could be saved from 'putrid fever. She had learnt this as a child from her grandfather, Southwood Smith, who developed his theories at the Fever Hospital at King's Cross.<br/><br/>He had built the first Industrial Dwellings for poor people and had proved statistically that good air and decent drainage saved lives. Gibson Gardens, in Northwold Road, is a direct outcome of Southwood Smith's ideas. More Information on Gibson Gardens<br/><br/>The Importance of Open Air<br/><br/>Open spaces and the opportunity to breathe clean air, were essential for people living in one or two crowded rooms. Octavia Hill took her charges from the Lisson Grove slums, up Fitzjohn's Avenue to Hampstead Heath. She so loved the Fitzjohn's Avenue fields that she tried to buy them as a public park. They were to cost £10,000 and within three August weeks £8,500 had been raised. It needed only the end of the summer holidays and the return from holiday of sympathetic friends and the further £1,500 would have been raised, but the owners suddenly withdrew their offer. Despite all pleading, the fields were covered with large houses.<br/><br/>From this developed the campaign to save Parliament Hill, the next open space northwards from Lisson Grove, buying up fields in the path of the builders to make a permanent cordon sanitalre against the advancing bricks. The Parliament Hill Fields campaign was so successful that the Hampstead Heath Bill was passed and there was money over from the appeal. From this money and the impetus towards open spaces, was to develop the National Trust. Octavia Hill had been interested in protecting areas like Church Bottom Wood for years, so she was a natural ally in the fight to save the Wood.<br/><br/>The Commons Preservation Society also, was familiar with this kind of agitation and money collection. They had torn down fencing when lords of the manor had enclosed pieces of common land, leading both legal and illegal battles against the arrogant privatization of land traditionally free. Robert Hunter, their Honorary Solicitor from 1868, was always concerned with securing open spaces, large or small, for the public. He, now Sir Robert Hunter, became the Chairman of the Church Bottom Appeal. The Chairman of the Commons Preservation Society was Mr Shaw-Lefevre MP (later Lord Eversley) who played a big part in this and other campaigns in the House of Commons. Octavia Hill had been involved in their work from about 1875.<br/><br/>At the same time Octavia Hill was campaigning for a Burials Bill.<br/><br/>City churchyards had become so full and such a serious a hazard to health, by contaminating wells from which people drew their drinking water, that City burials were no longer permitted. Instead, cemetries were created on the outskirts of town. Abney Park Cemetary was one of these. There was then a movement to remove the headstones to the edges of the old town cemetries, re-inter the bodies elsewhere and turn the cemetries into gardens and open spaces, instead of building on them. This land in the centre of London was very valuable and speculators were avid to obtain it: Even the Quakers had built over one of their cemetries and threatened to do so again by building over Bunhill Fields. Octavia Hill had a network of allies in a dozen fields, so her help to save the Church Bottom Wood must have been invaluable.<br/><br/>The Metropolitan Gardens Society, set up in 1882, had laid out about two hundred small gardens in city centres by 1890. They later handed them over to the Local Authorities, so their support for the Churchyard Bottom Wood Appeal was assured from the start.<br/><br/>The Kyrle Society is forgotten now, but in its day had great influence on Town Planning and Open Space legislation. The Society had been set up about 1875 for 'the Diffusion of Beauty', to bring colour and interest into the lives of people living in dull, drab surroundings. Bright colour to walls and decoration, good singing, open spaces, Nature, Literature and Art. All these fell within the Society's remit. There was a Decorative Branch, for whom William Morris lectured; a Musical Branch to promote choirs and Happy Evenings for people in local school buildings; and a Literature Branch. The Society appealed regularly by letters in The Times, to 'the richer classes' for books and periodicals to be distributed to boys' and girls' clubs, almshouses and elsewhere. However the Open Spaces Committee was the most active. The very name 'Kyrle' came from Pope's The Man of Ross, the philanthropist who gave his birthplace to the people as a public park. | Kyrkjegarden Botnskogen<br/><br/>Høggate<br/><br/>Kyrkjegarden Botnskogen, Highgate<br/><br/>No kalla Queen's Wood<br/><br/>Mellom 1860 og 1880 vart senteret rive ut av City of London for å byggje kloakk, jernbaner og nye vegar, og hus vart rivne utan omsyn til leigarane som måtte finne det tilbodet dei kunne finne andre stader. Forvaltarane gjekk til livo i Kensington og St. John's Wood, medan dei fattigaste busette seg i rookeries som Seven Dials og Lisson Grove. For dei mellom anna kontoristar og dyktige arbeidarar, sette spekulative byggmeisterar opp rad etter rad med rekkehus og Mr. Pooter flytta inn i Holloway. Folket i Muswell Hill såg hus krype over marka i Finsbury Park, opp Crouch Hill og ned på den andre sida, slik at det i 1880 vart utvikla Crouch End og det såg ikkje ut til å vere nokon måte å dempe straumen på. Ti år seinare vart dei store eigedomane til Muswell Hill selde. Upton Farm vart seld og kyrkjekommissærane ønskte å utvikle Churchyard Bottom Wood, no kalla Queen's Wood. Forteljinga ville ha gjort eit Ibsen-spel. To grupper av ærlege, høgt motiverte menneske som kjempar for det dei trudde var rett. Ecclesiastical Commissioners på den eine sida og Committee of the Hornsey Charities på den andre, meinte begge at dei gjorde sitt beste for andre folk, og publikum reiste seg mot dei begge i indignasjon<br/><br/>På den tida var Muswell Hill Road ein landeveg, med Southwood Hall i den eine enden og Upton Farm i den andre.I 1894 vart Onslow Gardens bygd, Connaught Gardens markert ut, og innbyggjarane var klare til å utvikle Woodlands-godset. Cut out of Churchyard Bottom Wood var ei gruppe nedtumla hytter, på ein trekanta stad. Eit utdatert kart, halde av kyrkjelege kommisjonærar, viser seks avfallshytter med ei opning mellom seg - ikkje ein veg, ikkje metallisert, men ein veg gjennom til jordbærsengene bak. Lenger nede var det eit anna gap som førte til gangstiar gjennom skogen. Desse to opningane skulle vere grunnlaget for planen. Dei same to opningane og det rydda terrenget, som var jordbærmarka, kan ein sjå på kartet frå 1894 nedanfor. Dei vert vist som «Muswell Hill Cottages» og, ganske i forbifarten, Peter Sellers skulle bu på same stad mykje seinare. For å utvikle veden som bustad måtte kommisjonen driva to vegar gjennom frå Muswell Hill Road og byggja hus langs dei. Framsida av Muswell Hill Road ville ikkje ha gjeve plass til nok hus til å gjere ferda verdsleg.<br/><br/>Landområda og hyttene hadde vorte gjevne mykje tidlegare som almissehus for gamle folk og vart haldne på deira vegner av trustenane til Hornsey Charity Commissioners. Forvaltarane ønskte å gjere det beste for dei gamle leiarane sine, og kunne ikkje forbetra dei sidan dei ikkje hadde pengar. Nokre år før hadde kyrkjekommissærane planlagt å utvikle Gravel Pit Wood (no Highgate Wood) som bustad, men dette hadde møtt så stor motstand at dei i 1886 i staden gav alle 69 mål skog til det offentlege. Samstundes tilbaud dei å selje Churchyard Bottom Wood til Hornsey Urban District Council for 25 000 pund, men dette vart for mykje for Hornsey å heve på eiga hand. Rådet sa at folk som budde utanfor Hornsey òg likte skogen og andre myndigheiter skulle hjelpe, men det vart ikkje gjeve hjelp.<br/><br/>Kart som viser Muswell Hill Cottages som var sentrum for kontroversen.<br/><br/>Muswell Hill Road kring 1880<br/><br/>Det ser ut til at desse tre hyttene var dei som stod i sentrum for striden.<br/><br/>Ecclesiastical Commissioners ønskte å skaffe pengar til kyrkjearbeidet sitt i Storbritannia og i utlandet. Dei rekna med at dei hadde fått landområda som skulle nyttast til propaganda for religionen, og om dette innebar at dei selde land eller skog, var det eit mindre dårskap enn å avgrensa arbeidet til kyrkja. Dei hadde gjeve Gravel Pit Wood til publikum: i staden ville dei utvikla Churchyard Bottom Wood.<br/><br/>Forvaltarane av Hornsey Charities ønskte å produsere ei inntekt for å hjelpe dei fattige, så dei kom med eit tilbod til kommissærane. Dei trekanta landområda deira var for klønete til at dei kunne utvikla seg økonomisk, men om kommissærane ville gje dei noko meir land til å gjere det til ein firkanta stad, ville dei byggje tjuefem pene villaer. Desse ville føre med seg jordleiar på £225 per år, som kunne brukast til å avlaste fattigdomen til Hornsey-folk, og til gjengjeld ville dei la kommisjonen skjere to vegar gjennom landet deira slik at kommissærane kunne utvikle skogen.<br/><br/>Då dette tilbodet blei kjent reagerte folk straks med alarm.<br/><br/>Den 16. desember 1893 spurte parlamentsmedlem Carvell Williams i Underhuset om kyrkjekommissærane hadde gått med på å selje ei landstripe til Hornsey Charities Trustees på vilkår at ein eksisterande veg vart utvida til 40 fot, om dette var eit førebuande til ei bygningsordning og om Stortinget ville få høve til å gi uttrykk for ei meining.<br/><br/>Leveson Gower, ein kommisjonær i Church Estates, svarte 'ja' på den første delen.<br/><br/>Mr Carvell Williams, «Skjøner eg at det er intensjonen å øydeleggje den delen av Highgate Woods ved å byggje på det?»<br/><br/>To dagar seinare publiserte The Star ein artikkel som var verd ein moderne tabloid.<br/><br/>Stjernen<br/>18. desember 1893<br/><br/>«Parlamenta må halda vakt over dei gamle vandalane og konføderasjonane til jerry-byggjarane, dei geistlege kommissærane, dei støter alltid frå seg eit stykke land eller favoriserer byggjarane i motsetnad til det offentlege. Kommisjonærane ville ikkje selje Churchyard Bottom-veden til skattebetalarane, men no føreslå «å opne den» ved å kutte to breie vegar gjennom den i samband med ei av dei talrike byggeplanane deira. Vil ikkje nokon stille eit spørsmål på Stortinget og sjekke mursteins- og mørtelpolitikken til kommissærane?»<br/><br/>Då dette vart trykt, hadde spørsmålet vorte stilt og svaret var anten usant eller falskt. Andre aviser tok opp forteljinga. The Times sa i ei lang rapport at kommisærane ikkje var førebudd på å gje ei forplikting om at Stortinget, eller noko anna offentleg organ, skulle ha høve til å vurdere ei kvar som helst plan for å byggje på tomta til veden.<br/><br/>Situasjonen vart svekka i atten månader før kyrkjekommissærane vart tvinga til å opna ei undersøking, som byrja ved Highgate den 31. mai 1895, leia av ein assisterande kyrkjekommissær. Undersøkinga produserte ei mengd avisbrev, der dette var det viktigaste.<br/><br/>Dagleg krønike, 5. juni 1895<br/><br/>VANDALISME HØYT<br/><br/>Sir –<br/><br/>Vil du hjelpe oss å avverge det som ville vore ein katastrofe, ikkje berre for det nærliggande distriktet, men for heile det tettbefolka Nord-London? Ingen stader i storbyen har innbyggjarane vore meir aktive enn i Crouch End og Hornsey. Dei vakre engene for eit år eller to sidan er no hus og butikkar. Ballasthaugar har teke plassen til statlege almar og kastanjer, og tidlegare trivelege landsbyar deler skjebnen til Stroud Green, Harringay, Finsbury Park, Highbury og Islington.<br/><br/>---- Objektet er bygging av to 40-fots vegar gjennom skogen. Vi i dette distriktet kjenner tydinga av 40-fots vegar gjennom skogen. Det betyr at skogen er fortapt.

Inkluderinga av dei to prestane var eit klokt trekk, hugs at dette framleis var høgdepunktet i Darwin-striden. Darwin hadde delt tru på læren til Kyrkja og mange menneske ville ha mislikt makta til Kyrkja frå dette synspunktet aleine. Kyrkja var ikkje så trygg som ho hevda å vere.<br/><br/>Aftenbladet 7. juni 1895 sa: -<br/><br/>«Viss dei geistlege kommisærane ikkje vert tekne tak i med ein gong, vil byggjeblekkspruten få eit grep om treet som vil vera svært vanskeleg å lausne seinare, ---. Derfor må londonarane stå opp og gjere om dei vil redde ein av sine mest ljuvlege bitar av rustikk natur. Den offentlege etterforskinga er utsett til torsdag neste dag, og før den tid må noko gjerast for å overtyde kommissærane om at borgarane i London ikkje vil tolere konfiskering av ein av deira favoritt-lekeplassar.»<br/><br/>Eit brev i Daily Chronicle dagen etter sa: -<br/><br/>.... Det var med stor lettelse at innbyggjarane, for om lag ti år sidan, høyrte at kjøpa av Øvreskogen hadde vorte gjennomført; og kor gledeleg ei bøn dette har vist seg, alle som vitja dei kan vitne, men alle som prøvde å redde desse øvreskogane, som ligg på vestsida av Muswell Hill-vegen, følte at sigeren deira var ufullstendig så lenge dei seksti måla på austsida var i fare. Kan nokon tvila på kva effekten ville bli om Churchyard Bottom Wood vart erstatta av rader med små villaer, som kvar sender ut sitt bidrag av røyk og sot? Kan nokon òg tvila på den alvorlege skilnaden det ville gjere på den pittoreske innstillinga til dei kjøpte skogane dersom ei linje med stirrande nye hus skulle køyrast opp rett over mot den løvrike fasaden deira?»<br/><br/>Dette gav uttrykk for synspunkta til mange menneske. Gravel Pit Wood, som forfattaren kallar «Upper Wood», var faktisk ikkje blitt kjøpt, men gjeven til distriktet av Ecclesiastical Commission, eit punkt dei skulle gjenta gang på gang gjennom åra, men dei fleste ignorerte det. Kommisjonen kom ikkje til å gje bort eit nytt tre uansett kva nokon sa, og heldt denne posisjonen til siste slutt.<br/><br/>H.S.Chamberlain frå 5 Cranley Gardens, i eit brev til The Times datert 8. juni 1895, oppfordra til kjøp.<br/><br/>Eg veit at det er vanleg å snakke hardt om dei geistlege kommisjonærane, men som leiarar av eit fond er dei forplikta til å administrere det med størst moglegheit, og difor, dersom noko skal gjerast for å berge rivinga av treverka, ser det for meg ut til at det allereie var ei sak for kommisjonærane at det berre kunne skje ved kjøp av eigedomar for dei som kommisjonærane, som eg veit, er i stand til å handsame for dei, og til å handsame for dei som er fullt levande til å verne om det for dei frie for folk og som er i fri.<br/><br/>(Dette viser til Crouch End Playing Fields som hadde vorte sikra nokre år seinare.)<br/><br/>Som formann i Muswell Hill Conservative Association er eg i konstant kontakt med innbyggjarane, og eg kan trygt slå fast at kvar einskild innbyggjar i nabolaget vil gjere alt som er fornuftig å ta vare på.<br/><br/>(Alt han personleg ville ha var veldedige inntekter for å støtte sitt fattige folk. Han krevde sin acre av land - ikkje så mye sikkert - han trudde kommissærane si forsikring om at skogen ikke var i fare.)<br/><br/>«Muswell Hill Road var ein av dei beste i Hornsey og ville halde seg like vakker, hus eller ingen hus»,<br/><br/>(og så kom den store retoriske oppblomstringa.)<br/><br/>«Skal dei fattige lida på grunn av dei sentimentale innvendingane og det hysteriske ropet til 'ulven som nyleg er reist av korrespondentane dine? Noe må gjerast og det snart. Ein acre av backland lagt til veldedighetseiendommen ville ikkje gjere noko merkbar forskjell på det gjenværende landet, mens profitten frå det ville hjelpe mange fattige gamle og verdige personar i sine fallande år og gjere oss i stand til å overlate til våre etterkomarar en eiendom som i fjern framtid ville være av stor verdi i å gi veldedig hjelp til dei verdige fattige i soknet 'Hornsey.<br/><br/>Når ein les brevet hans, føler ein hysteri svært nær overflata. Kvifor trudde han at kommissærane ville byggje ein veg? Kvifor skulle dei bruke alle desse pengane om dei ikkje skulle byggje hus? Han såg aldri ut til å innse at for ein hektar land ville hele skogen gå tapt, men han hadde vært med problemet i lang tid. Han var den personen som kommissærane hadde gjeve tilbod om å selje for 25 000 pund år tidlegare, og det er namnet hans som vert æra på ein plakett på Crouch End Clock Tower for å ha redda veden, men tilliten hans til dei geistlege kommissærane verkar naiv. Det er trist at han ved granskinga skulle bli kasta som djevelen.<br/><br/>Etterforskinga heldt fram<br/><br/>Den avlyste opninga i Highgate den 15. juni 1895. I påvente av ei stor samling hadde rådhuset vorte heilt endra. Dei vanlege borda var fjerna og rommet fylt med stolar. Ved halvsju-tiden var rommet overfylt, med folk som josta etter seter.<br/><br/>Murray, kommissæren, sa at etterforskinga verkeleg var enkel, og at Hornsey Parochial Charities ønskte å kjøpe eit stykke land som grensa til veldedighetseigenskapen deira på baksida. Spørsmålet var om veldedighetskommisjonen, som kontrollerte alle veldedige organisasjonar, hadde nok makt til å stoppe dei. Kyrkjekommissærane var førebudd på å selje jorda på svært gunstige vilkår og inntektene til veldedigheita ville auka mykje.<br/><br/>Mot dette var det tre innvendingsklassar.<br/><br/>Den opphavlege trua hadde som føremål å gje hus til dei fattige, men forvaltarane foreslo å byggje villaer som ville bli for dyre for dei fattige. Det var likevel innanfor forvaltarane si makt å variere vilkåra i trua, slik at dei kunne byggje villaer om dei trudde at dei fattige ville ha nytte av det til slutt. Fattige folk kunne sjølv komme med innvendingar, men det var allereie lovnad om liberale bestemmelser for dei. Den tredje innvendinga gjaldt den estetiske og offentlege sida av spørsmålet. Han tok det ut frå det han hadde lese at veldedighetskommisjonen burde blande seg inn for å hindre at kyrkjekommissærane utøvde sitt eige skjønn i handsaminga av eigedomane sine.<br/><br/>Undersøkinga diskuterte fine punkt, men talarane kom stadig tilbake til det store problemet med å hindre at veden vart øydelagd. Vestry-klanen i Islington, som representerte 300 000 menneske, gjorde ein formell protest om kva som helst del av skogen, som var så verdifull for folket i Islington og Hornsey at dei vart nytta til private føremål. Mr Wilfred White sa at dersom kommissærane ville gje dei tid, ville dei vere i stand til å samle inn pengar for å kompensere tillitsmennene.<br/><br/>Beaumont sa dei ikkje ville ha villaer, dei ville ha hytter for fattige som vart drivne ut av distriktet. Andre sa at det ikkje var pengar til å byggja hytter for å erstatta dei gamle, men at villaer var eit økonomisk forslag. Andre sa at det var mange villaer å leie i Highgate. Skogen var heilag. Hald fast ved spørsmålet om skogen.<br/><br/>Dr. Fletcher sa at ropet blant dei arbeidande var at det ikkje var nokon stad å gå. Arbeidande folk kom til han med ropet: "Vi er drivne ut av Highgate og er nøydde til å gå til Highgate New Town." Om Muswell Hill Road-fronten vart seld var det ingen tvil om, men at vegar kunne klippast rett gjennom skogen i retning Hornsey, men om kommissærane ikkje kunne få landområdet frå Charity Commission kunne dei ikkje klippa vegen.<br/><br/>Han var svært sikker på at hyttene kunne setjast i ein skikkeleg stand for reparasjon. Han vart beden av dei fattige, av politiet og av ei rekkje arbeidarklassar om å representere desse to punkta, at hyttebustad var særs sårt tiltrengt i Highgate og at dersom dei ein gong tillét at jorda kunne seljast, var det uvisst kvar handverkaren skulle bu.<br/><br/>(Høgt og forlenga heider).<br/><br/>Talrike andre tok til orde og kommissæren oppsummerte det ved å seie at han meinte at den rådande oppfatninga var i favør av å halde på hyttene, men møtet skulle ikkje trekke nokon konklusjonar av det han hadde sagt (Groans).<br/><br/>Andre sa at trusten av veldedigheten hadde mislukkast i sine plikter ved å la hyttene falle i forfall.<br/><br/>H.R. Williams, som hadde skrive til avisa tidlegare, sa at han hadde den beste autoriteten til at kyrkjekommissærane ikkje ville gjera noko som helst, og at dei ikkje ville ha noko som helst utbytte av handlingane til veldedighetskommissærane. Andre var langt mindre tillitsfulle og møtet lukkast etter nesten tre timar.<br/><br/>«Vi er konfrontert med at i Highgate og Muswell Hill er det ei rekkje personar som vil ha Churchyard Bottom Wood og vil ikkje bli nøgd før dei har fått det - medan ingen ser ut til å vere villig til å bruke ein skilling for å betale for det. Alle seier at det ville vore fint å ha veden som open plass, men alle meiner det er plikta til nokon andre å gjere det til ein. Islington Vestry har «avgjort» om emnet, men Islington Vestry tilbyr ikkje eit ørestykke mot kjøpet. --- Det finst ikkje noko vanskelegare problem for samfunnet eller den enkelte å løyse enn korleis ein kan få tak i andre sine eigedomar utan å betale for det.»<br/><br/>Etter kvart som Churchyard Bottom Wood blei gjenstand for intens lokal og nasjonal debatt, vart det oppretta ein felles komite for å samle inn pengar for å redde veden. Cory-Wright, Hon Treasurer, skreiv til The Standard, ei dagsavis på den tida, og bad om hjelp. Han påminte alle om faren ved å miste veden og sa at det berre kunne reddast ved å kjøpe han. Kyrkjekommissærane ville selje for 25 000 pund og eit ekstra (5000 ville krevjast for gjerde og drenering, noko som til saman utgjorde 30 000 pund. Dette var for mykje for Hornsey Council å heve, men dei hadde allereie stemt 10 000 pund mot totalen. Skogen var av uvurderleg verdi for heile Nord-London, så han appellerte til offentlege organ og privatpersonar om å skaffe dei gjenverande 20 000 punda, og han åtvara om at tilbodet frå kyrkjekommissærane berre var ope til slutten av 1898. Etter det flytta innbyggjarane inn.<br/><br/>Pressa tok varmt imot klagen. Ei privatlov vart sendt gjennom parlamentet og Highgate Woods Preservation Act, 1897, blei lov. Conunittee hadde no rett til å annonsere for bidrag til kjøp av treet og bevaring av det.<br/><br/>I løpet av ganske kort tid vart nesten alle pengane heva, men dei siste tusen viste seg å vere svært vanskelege å heva og tidsfristen til kommissærane var eit spørsmål om veker unna. Cory-Wright skreiv at han bad om meir tid, men fekk berre tre månader og då berre om renter på 4 prosent vart betalt for den ekstra perioden på heile summen. Til slutt kom London County Council, som opphavleg hadde tilbydd 2 500 pund, opp i dette til 5 000 pund og totalen vart nådd, men det var ein nærgåande ting.<br/><br/>Rådet vedtok å endra namnet til «Queen's Woods» til ære for dronning Victoria sitt Diamond Jubilee og Hornsey sette på ei fin oppvising då hertuginna av Albany formelt erklærte Wood open «for fri bruk av publikum for alltid».<br/><br/>Medan kampanjen for å redde Churchyard Bottom Wood vart driven og dirigert av lokale folk som følte lidenskap for dette spesielle stykket skog, bad dei om hjelp og erfaring frå eit stort nettverk av folk, nokre av dei hadde arbeidd saman på liknande felttog i over tretti år. Komiteen gav ut ein appell, trykt på papir av svært god kvalitet og med nokre kjende namn.<br/><br/>Spørsmåla om opent rom og folkehelse var store tema i den viktorianske visjonen.<br/><br/>Bevegelsen for opne rom<br/><br/>Octavia Hill, den store husreformatoren, som hadde byrja med tre gamle hus i Marylebone, kjøpt for henne av Jolm Ruskin, hadde raskt blitt ein ekspert på å huse fattige folk i dei sunneste tilhøva. Måten hennar var å kjøpe leige og så slå ned nokre av dei overfylte husa for å få lys og luft til resten, i den tru at frisk luft og sollys var den einaste måten fattige kunne bli redda frå 'råtne feber'. Ho hadde lært dette som barn av bestefaren, Southwood Smith, som utvikla teoriane sine ved Fever Hospital ved King's Cross.<br/><br/>Han hadde bygd dei første industrielle bustadane for fattige og hadde vist statistisk at god luft og anstendig drenering redda liv. Gibson Gardens, i Northwold Road, er eit direkte resultat av ideane til Southwood Smith.<br/><br/>Viktigheita av open luft<br/><br/>Opne rom og moglegheita til å puste rein luft var vesentleg for folk som budde i eit eller to overfylte rom. Octavia Hill tok ladningane sine frå Lisson Grove slummen, opp Fitzjohn's Avenue til Hampstead Heath. Ho var så glad i åkrene på Fitzjohn's Avenue at ho prøvde å kjøpe dei som ein offentleg park. Dei skulle kosta 10 000 pund og i løpet av tre veker i august hadde det vorte samla inn 8 500 pund. Det trengde berre slutten av sommarferien og tilbakekomsten av sympatiske vener og dei ytterlegare £ 1500 ville ha vorte samla inn, men eigarane trekte brått tilbodet sitt tilbake. Trass i alle bøner vart åkeren dekt med store hus.<br/><br/>Frå dette utvikla felttoget seg til å redde Parliament Hill, den neste opne plassen nordover frå Lisson Grove, og kjøpte opp jorder i vegen til innbyggjarane for å lage ein permanent cordon sanitalre mot dei framrykkande mursteinane. Parliament Hill Fields-kampanjen var så vellykka at Hampstead Heath Bill vart vedteken og det kom pengar over frå appellen.Av desse pengane og drivkrafta mot opne rom, var å utvikle National Trust. Octavia Hill hadde vore interessert i å verne område som Church Bottom Wood i fleire år, så ho var ein naturleg alliert i kampen for å redde skogen.<br/><br/>Commons Preservation Society var òg kjend med denne typen agitasjon og pengeinnsamling. Dei hadde rive ned fektinga då herrene på herregarden hadde innelukka delar av felles landområde, og førte både lovlege og ulovlege kampar mot den arrogante privatiseringa av landområde som tradisjonelt var frie. Robert Hunter, æresadvokaten deira frå 1868, var alltid oppteken av å sikre opne rom, store eller små, for publikum. Han, no Sir Robert Hunter, vart formann i Church Bottom Appeal. Formannen i Commons Preservation Society var Mr. Shaw-Lefevre MP (seinare Lord Eversley) som spelte ei stor rolle i denne og andre valkampar i Underhuset.Octavia Hill hadde vore involvert i arbeidet deira frå kring 1875.<br/><br/>Samstundes førte Octavia Hill ein kampanje for ei gravferdslov.<br/><br/>Kyrkjegardane i byen hadde vorte så fulle og ein så alvorleg helsefare ved å forurense brønnar som folk drog drikkevatnet sitt frå, at det ikkje lenger var lov å gravleggja folk i byen. I staden vart det oppretta gravplassar i utkanten av byen. Abney Park Cemetery var ein av desse, og det var då ei rørsle for å fjerne gravsteinane til kantane av dei gamle bykyrkjene, mellom anna for å gjere om gravplassane til hagar og opne plassar, i staden for å byggje på dei. Dette landet i sentrum av London var svært verdifullt og spekulantar var ivrige etter å få tak i det: sjølv kvekarane hadde bygd over ein av gravplassane sine og truga med å gjere det igjen ved å byggje over Bunhill Fields. Octavia Hill hadde eit nettverk av allierte på eit dusin felt, så hjelpa hennar til å redde Church Bottom Wood må ha vore uvurderlig.<br/><br/>Metropolitan Gardens Society, som vart oppretta i 1882, hadde lagt ut om lag to hundre småhagar i bysentrum i 1890, og dei overlét dei seinare til dei lokale styresmaktene, slik at støtta deira for Churchyard Bottom Wood Appeal vart sikra frå starten.<br/><br/>Kyrkjesamfunnet er gløymt no, men hadde i si tid stor innverknad på byplanlegging og Open Space-lovgjeving. Samfunnet vart skipa kring 1875 for «Skjønnhetsdiffusjonen», for å bringe farge og interesse inn i liva til folk som levde i kjedelige, triste omgjevnader. Lyse fargar til veggar og dekorasjon, god song, opne rom, natur, litteratur og kunst. Alle desse var innanfor Samfunnet sitt ansvarsområde, det var ei dekorativ grein, som William Morris underviste for, ei musikalsk grein for å promotere kor og happy evenings for folk i lokale skulebygningar, og ei litteraturgrein. Samfunnet appellerte regelmessig i brev i The Times til «dei rikare klassene» om at bøker og tidsskrift skulle distribuerast til gut- og jenteklubbar, almissehus og andre stader, men Open Spaces-komiteen var den mest aktive. Sjølve namnet «Kyrle» kom frå Popes The Man of Ross, filantropen som gav fødestaden sin til folket som ein offentleg park. |
| With Thanksgiving around the corner, here are some festive file folder games we made for the girls. Both Thanksgiving games focus on math skills. And I'm grateful once again to my husband, Ed, for making all the clipart for me.<br/><br/>Thanksgiving Pattern Making<br/><br/>Like the name says, this game is about making patterns. Little ones just learning about patterns, can simply match the pictures onto the pattern strips, while others can continue the pattern with the picture cards on the blank strips.<br/><br/>To make the file folder, you want to cut out the grid of pictures to make the card pieces. I recommend laminating them to help them last longer. Then glue the pattern strips down on the file folder.<br/><br/>I wanted to have the blank pattern strips too so that the girls could see where to continue the pattern and how many to lay out. I attached them to the side of the folder using tape so that they could fold in to pack up the game and extend to layout the pattern.<br/><br/>I also added an extra blank one so that the girls could make their own pattern as well.<br/><br/>Turkey Number Game<br/><br/>In this game the girls add the feathers to the turkey body while practicing counting and number recognition. I used the colorless feathers to act as a guide for where to add the feathers and so that the girls could match the numbers. And be sure when gluing down the turkey body you only glue in the center so that the wing pieces can slide under the body.<br/><br/>Once all the feathers are laid out, we practice some simple arithmetic, such as taking away three feathers and seeing how many are left then adding two back to see what it equals.<br/><br/>In addition to black and white wings, we also included a colorless turkey in case you want to have the little ones color their own set. Instead of a file folder game you can turn this into a craft, coloring the pieces, cutting them out, and gluing them together.<br/><br/>Another option is to use the pieces to make a felt board story. We sometimes sing a turkey version of 10 Little Indians:<br/><br/>Like this:<br/><br/>Who Am I?<br/><br/>I think this is where I'm suppose to say something witty about myself. Oh well. I'm a stay-at-home mom to three awesome kids--our twin daughters who are seven now and a two-year-old son who is full of energy. In my pre-children life I was a teacher and I now homeschool our children. I'm also married to Ed, who is currently serving in the Air Force, and is the love of my life (it'd be awkward if he wasn't). Our family is big on books, crafts, and having fun together. I just thought I would share our activities in my own little corner of the internet.<br/><br/>Zoe appears to have it all--rich, handsome husband, easy New York life--but she made mistakes in her past and those mistakes are coming back up in her new life. I found myself on the edge of my seat for most of the book and was surprised...<br/><br/>I loved this book, I love the story, and I am grateful Margot Shetterly brought it to light. My only complaint was that I wished she discussed Katherine Johnson's role in the later missions a bit more but I guess the story had to end som...<br/><br/>I wanted to like this book and I did throughout most of it. Dana finds out her estranged husband and his girlfriend are found dead in the New Mexico desert. I was immediately drawn in by her character and the story. I really enjoyed seei... | Med Thanksgiving rundt hjørnet, her er nokre festlege filmappespel me har laga for jentene. Begge Thanksgiving-spela fokuserer på matematiske ferdigheiter. Og eg er atter ein gong takksam til mannen min, Ed, for å ha laga alle utklippa for meg.<br/><br/>Å laga mønster til thanksgiving<br/><br/>Som namnet seier handlar dette spelet om å laga mønsterelement. Små som berre lærer om mønsterelement, kan ganske enkelt matcha bileta på mønsterelementa, medan andre kan halde fram med mønsterelementa med biletkorta på dei blanke elementa.<br/><br/>For å lage filmappa vil du klippa ut rutenettet av bilete for å lage kortbitane. Eg tilrår å laminere dei slik at dei varer lenger. Deretter limer du mønsterstripa ned på filmappa.<br/><br/>Eg ville òg ha blanke mønsterstriper slik at jentene kunne sjå kvar dei skulle fortsette mønsteret og kor mange dei skulle leggje ut. Eg festa dei til sida av mappa med tape, slik at dei kunne bretta seg inn for å pakka opp spelet og strekkje seg ut for å leggja opp mønsteret.<br/><br/>Eg la òg til eit ekstra blankt slik at jentene kunne laga sine eigne mønster òg.<br/><br/>Tyrkia- talspel<br/><br/>I dette spelet legg jentene fjøra til kalkunkroppen medan dei øvde på å telja og rekne. Eg brukte dei fargelause fjøra som rettesnor for kvar fjøra skulle leggjast til og slik at jentene kunne matche tala. Og pass på at når du limer ned kalkunkroppen limer du berre i midten slik at vengebitane kan gli under kroppen.<br/><br/>Når alle fjørene er lagt ut, øver vi på ein enkel aritmetikk, som å ta bort tre fjør og sjå kor mange som er att, og så legge til to tilbake for å sjå kva det er lik.<br/><br/>I tillegg til svarte og kvite venger, inkluderte vi òg ein fargelaus kalkun i tilfelle du ønskjer at dei små skal få farga sitt eige sett. I staden for eit filmappespel kan du gjera dette om til eit handverk, farga brikkene, klippa dei ut og lima dei saman.<br/><br/>Eit anna alternativ er å bruke brikkene til å lage ei filtplatehistorie.Noen gonger syng me ein kalkunversjon av 10 Little Indians:<br/><br/>Slik:<br/><br/>Kven er eg?<br/><br/>Eg trur det er her eg skal seie noko vittig om meg sjølv. Vel, eg er ein heime-mamma til tre fantastiske born -- tvillingdøtrene våre som er sju no og ein to år gammal son som er full av energi. I mitt førbarnsliv var eg lærar og heimeskule for borna våre. Eg er òg gift med Ed, som for tida er i flyvåpenet, og er mitt livs kjærleik (det ville vore pinleg om han ikkje var det). Familien vår er stor på bøker, handverk og å ha det gøy saman, så eg tenkte eg skulle dele aktivitetane våre i mitt eige lille hjørne av internett.<br/><br/>Zoe ser ut til å ha alt -- rik, kjekk mann, lett New York liv -- men ho gjorde feil i fortida og dei feila kjem opp igjen i sitt nye liv. Eg fann meg sjølv på kanten av setet mitt for det meste av boka og vart overraska...<br/><br/>Eg elska denne boka, eg elskar historia, og eg er takksam for at Margot Shetterly tok henne fram i lyset. Den einaste klagen min var at eg ønskte at ho diskuterte rolla til Katherine Johnson i dei seinare oppdraga litt meir, men eg antar at historia måtte ende somme...<br/><br/>Eg ønskte å like denne boka, og eg gjorde det gjennom det meste av det. Dana finn ut at mannen hennar og kjærasten hans er funne døde i New Mexico-ørkenen. Eg vart straks trekt inn av karakteren hennar og historia. Eg likte veldig godt å sjå ... |
| Alcohol use by persons under age 21 has been identified as a major public health problem. Studies note that it increases the risks for disability, and may be detrimental to the developing brain. Minors who drink are more likely to commit suicide, break the law, or be victims of violence. Alcohol is implicated in nearly one-third of youth traffic fatalities. The total annual cost of underage drinking is estimated at $62 billion. While most laws intended to prevent underage drinking are passed at the state level, there has been legislative activity and interest at the federal level to support states' efforts to curb the problem. This report describes the extent of underage alcohol use, recent legislative activity on this issue, and various policy implications. It will be updated as new data become available. | Bruk av alkohol av personar under 21 år er identifisert som eit stort folkehelseproblem.Studiar merkar at det aukar risikoen for funksjonshemming, og kan vere til skade for den utviklande hjernen. Mindreårige som drikk er meir sannsynlege for å begå sjølvmord, bryte lova eller bli utsett for vald. Alkohol er involvert i nesten ein tredjedel av dødsfalla i ungdomstrafikken. Den totale årlege kostnaden for drikking av mindreårige er estimert til 62 milliardar dollar. Medan dei fleste lovene som er meint å hindre mindreårige frå å drikka vert vedtekne på delstatsnivå, har det vore lovgjevande aktivitet og interesse på føderalt nivå for å støtte statleg innsats for å dempe problemet. Denne rapporten skildrar utbreiinga av alkoholbruk blant mindreårige, nyleg lovgjevande aktivitet på dette området, og ulike politiske implikasjonar. |
| Tag Archives: real food<br/><br/>Last week I wrote about the Nordic Food Manifesto, and how Denmark created a strong "real food" culture largely from an intentional effort led by Claus Meyer. It wasn't political lobbying or public petitioning that resulted in food reform, but rather a grassroots effort led by citizens with the power to actually implement and follow-through with change.<br/><br/>I ended the post alluding to one question: Why is it so hard for us to do this ourselves, as individuals? If an entire country can implement and spread a common view towards food, why can't we?<br/><br/>There's nothing really stopping us from mimicking Denmark's success. The problem is, we're inundated with so many messages about what we should be eating, and how we should be living, it's hard to know where to start. So rather than following successful frameworks that have been shown to work (like the Nordic Food Manifesto), most people jump from diet craze to diet craze, trying to find the "right way to eat."<br/><br/>But how did Claus Meyer succeed? What was the secret sauce that helped the Manifesto take hold? And is it reasonable to think we can apply those lessons to our own lives?

The unique outer crispiness of the meat gave way to a perfectly juicy interior, resulting in a sound more similar to slicing into a calzone than a ground beef patty.<br/><br/>We were sitting in Copenhagen's oldest pub, which felt more like a casual bistro than a bar, and I was about to try the dish recommended by our waitress/bar tender/proprietor?<br/><br/>"The Paris Beef, it's very good," she had said.

Det var ikkje politisk lobbyverksemd eller offentleg petisjon som resulterte i matreform, men heller ein grasrota innsats leia av borgarar med makt til faktisk å gjennomføre og følgje gjennom med endring.<br/><br/>Eg avslutta innlegget med eit spørsmål: Kvifor er det så vanskeleg for oss å gjere dette sjølve, som individ? Dersom eit heilt land kan implementere og spreie eit felles syn på mat, kvifor kan ikkje vi det?<br/><br/>Det er eigentleg ingenting som hindrar oss frå å etterlikne Danmarks suksess, problemet er at me er oversvømde med så mange meldingar om kva vi skal ete, og korleis vi skal leve, det er vanskeleg å vite kvar vi skal starte. Så i staden for å følgje vellukka reiskap som har vist seg å verka (som Det nordiske matmanifestet), hoppar dei fleste frå diettgalskap til diettgalskap, og prøver å finne «den rette måten å eta på».<br/><br/>Men korleis klarte Claus Meyer det? Kva var den hemmelege sausen som hjelpte Manifestet til å ta tak i? Og er det rimeleg å tru at vi kan bruke desse lærdomane i våre eigne liv?
