| While acknowledging that it's impossible to argue someone into loving something they hate, and vice versa, it's still often enjoyable to attempt the argument. When we talk to people whose opinions directly contradict ours, we're forced to defend our tastes, define our opinions, and analyze why we react the way we do. Which is why we have Why Don't You Like This?, in which two of our staffers will attempt to discover whether people with opposing opinions can get beyond "No, you're wrong!" and have a civil, constructive, and possibly even convincing discussion about their points of contention. Because no matter what talk radio says, there's still a middle ground between "We agree utterly" and "I'm right, and you're stupid and evil."<br/><br/>Scott: Since discussing my Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World apostasy, we've been looking for a case where I can call you out for not liking something wonderful, and we didn't have to look for long. We were sitting right next to each other during Martin Scorsese's Hugo—me, utterly enchanted by its fantastical tribute to the wonders of early silent cinema, and you, apparently resisting it at every turn. Critical consensus has been on my side: It hit the No. 9 spot on our collective Top 15 (though you listed it as your Overrated choice), has won (or placed) in various film-critic awards, and currently enjoys an 83 score on Metacritic. That doesn't mean you're wrong, of course, but the onus is on you to explain why Hugo was, in your words, "hollow and artificial," where many of us saw it as a lovely evocation of Scorsese's childhood and the medium when it was still in its infancy. And please be gentle as you rip this butterfly apart by the wings.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Tasha: I can't be gentle, Scott. Sometimes it hurts less if you rip the Band-Aid off all at once. (And even if it doesn't, who wants to walk around wearing a half-ripped-off Band-Aid? Gross.) The fact is, I found Hugo to be a wearyingly manipulative exercise in fakery, starting from its opening glide through a Paris train station, which reminded me more than anything of Robert Zemeckis' The Polar Express. Unlike Mike D'Angelo, I'm a fan of long, unbroken takes as a way of establishing a space and encouraging viewers to unconsciously hold their breaths as a camera explores an area; but when the space being explored is a slick, shiny CGI creation, and the camera floats weightlessly through it with no physical sense that either the camera or the surroundings are really there, that exploration starts to feel like watching someone else play a videogame. And the rest of the film felt similarly poreless and unreal to me, both in terms of its setting and in terms of its highly contrived, maudlin story.<br/><br/>I don't necessarily have a problem with manufactured, stylized environments in film. I loved Baz Luhrmann's equally sprawling, utterly artificial take on Paris in Moulin Rouge, for instance, but that film has a sense of its own ridiculousness, a sense of humor about how deliberately over-the-top it is. Ditto the stylization of Jean-Pierre Jeunet, particularly in Amélie. (Both Jeunet and Luhrmann felt like strong visual influences here.) I got the sense, however, that Martin Scorsese wanted me to take Hugo entirely seriously. Even though it's yet another achingly sentimental story about a plucky orphan bringing color back into the life of a grumpy old curmudgeon. And I just couldn't.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>There is nothing I enjoy more in film than being surprised. And there's nothing I resent and resist more than being overtly manipulated, being loudly told what to feel and when to feel it. A good film does this kind of thing subtly; a bad one uses crashing music cues and sweet strings—and in this case, a grubby, huge-eyed, disheveled orphan staring woefully at the camera—to demand pathos, and to tell viewers they're horrible people if they don't serve it up on demand. That said, I can deal with sad kids and grumpy adults making life better for each other—I really dug this year's Le Havre, which was essentially the same plot without all the cutesiness—but I find the artificial environments reflect badly on the artificial emotions, and each makes the other seem more fake by turns.<br/><br/>Let's start with that. In our overlooked films video, you and Noel both took Keith to task for championing Tyrannosaur, because you felt it wasn't realistic enough—too contrived, too miserablist, too much, too far. How is it possible that you can't buy a stymied old crank who breaks things when he's angry, but you can buy an orphan living inside a giant train-station clock and embarking upon a whimsical journey to repair a mysterious automaton that he believes might bear secrets from his dead father, but which instead leads him on a quirky voyage of self-discovery, into the magical land of cinema? Did you never find Hugo's gaudy rococo design, aggressive heartstring-plucking, or wheelbarrow-loads of quirk even a little excessive or hard to swallow?<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Scott: Jeunet and Luhrmann as influences on Scorsese?! Forget being indelicate, now you're deliberately poking me with a sharp stick. If you're looking for inspirations for Hugo—indeed, if you're looking for the emotional core of Hugo—you have to go back to Scorsese's childhood on Elizabeth Street in Little Italy, where an asthmatic little boy, unable to play outside with the other kids, retreated to Alexander Korda fantasies like The Thief Of Bagdad. Or, more simply, just go straight to the source himself: George Méliès, whose A Trip To The Moon remains the Big Bang of all cinematic fantasies, that moment when the camera was not used to document the world as it is, but whatever whimsical, magical, transporting place a filmmaker wants to invent for it. And that tradition has been developed and expanded upon for decades before the likes of Jeunet and Luhrmann got their grubby little paws on it.<br/><br/>And speaking of Jeunet, nice attempt to take away my rhetorical weapon, but I'll say it anyway: How can you love Amélie, yet find Hugo synthetic and "excessive" and "wearyingly manipulative"? You say that Amélie and Moulin Rouge have redeeming "sense of [their] own ridiculousness" where Scorsese means us to take Hugo seriously, and I don't think that's the case, at least on the latter point. That Scorsese feels evident passion about the movies is, I suppose, why you'd interpret Hugo as self-serious. But to me, it's those feelings that give the film an emotional ballast that the Luhrmann and Jeunet films don't have. All three films make aggressive use of the marvels of CGI—and Scorsese adds 3D to the mix, to wonderful effect—but where you and I differ is on the issue of weightlessness. I agree that CGI has a distancing effect; worlds composed entirely of digital plasticine are flexible to the point where they sometimes have no presence. You referred to Hugo in your "Overrated" entry for our Best Of Film piece as "a CGI gimcrack"—a perfect dis… for another movie.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>It's fair to say that Scorsese has built Hugo around a standard-issue, "heartstring-plucking" children's book/movie plot: Orphan misses his daddy, creates his own little fantasy world, gloms onto a new friend, convinces a crusty old fuddy-duddy to soften up and maybe adopt him. But that's just the narrative skeleton, and Scorsese provides plenty of flesh and blood. For one, you can't watch Hugo, the lonely boy, peering out from clock towers to the hustle-and-bustle of a Paris train station without thinking of Scorsese, another lonely boy, staring out of his bedroom window on Elizabeth Street. And even if you're not a big enough film nerd to make that connection, I really feel like Hugo's journey is not in finding a new father figure, but in persisting with the mechanical magic that stands as his own father's legacy. That's what film is: The persistence of vision that allows us to accept an illusory version of the world at 24 frames per second is science and magic at once. Hugo's relationship with Méliès isn't about him cozying up to a new daddy, but sharing a common enthusiasm the old man has submerged in bitterness. To me, that's a far more unique angle on a potentially shopworn premise.<br/><br/>Did you really find none of Hugo enchanting? Even the film's few detractors seem willing to admit that the sequences evoking cinema history and Méliès' studio—with Michael Stuhlbarg as the heroic film scholar!—were terrific. It felt, in the best possible way, like a heady compression of my History Of Film 101 class in college, condensing a semester's worth of clips and context into something between a montage and an animated pop-up book. And it speaks to the ingenious design of the film, which layers fact and fantasy so beautifully that it's at once a history of Méliès and the birth of cinema, and just the sort of simple, sumptuously produced cinematic wonder that Scorsese himself would have loved as a child. Thank goodness Hugo doesn't follow the Jeunet/Luhrmann model and have "a sense of its own ridiculousness." As a fantasy connoisseur yourself, wouldn't you say there's value in playing it straight and earnest and unabashed rather than winking at the audience? You may find Hugo sickly sweet, but I don't think the authenticity of its sentiment is to be denied.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Tasha: Yes, I did in fact find parts of Hugo enchanting. (Notice how I'm answering your question up front, whereas you were too busy frothing with apoplexy to address mine, though I assume that's an answer in its own right. Okay, "influence" may be overstating the case—I just meant the visual style looked very familiar. Though as Keith pointed out when you brought this up in person, Scorsese is neither opposed to drawing inspiration from other people's visuals, nor immune to it.) Primarily, I was enchanted by the parts dealing with Georges Méliès' backstory, with his love of cinema, with the work he put into his art and the joy he got out of it. There's an awful lot of beauty and fun in the staging of the underwater-court scene from Méliès' "Fairyland," and in the sequence at the end, focusing on Méliès footage. I'll grant you that Hugo's connection with Méliès over a shared love of film is a nice touch. And I do enjoy a good film about filmmaking.<br/><br/>But Hugo isn't primarily about film, in spite of the Méliès tie-ins. In addition to the themes you cite, it's also about finding your purpose, as the characters expressly, laboriously explain to each other and to us. And it's about spectacle, and big action setpieces, and chases, and happily-ever-after endings where even the angry bully and the shy older couple and fergawdsakes even the cranky dachshund all get paired off with charming love interests by the end. It's about the super-precocious Hermione Granger-type being bossy and perky and clever and praising the magical worlds encased in books. And all of this business is mighty familiar, and mighty artificial.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Yes, Scorsese is playing with archetypes. Problem is, I never felt he imbued them with anything new, fresh, or believable, in spite of his own backstory. I would have much preferred a story about a young Scorsese growing up with asthma—something small-scale and real, without vast rooms full of CGI clockwork and golden glowing dust-motes and prophetic dreams and a raging adult tyrant-guard with a heart of gold—all of that outsized, over-the-top nonsense. You keep citing Scorsese's personal background and love of film as evidence that he's really feeling what he's putting on the screen, but I don't feel his personal touch in any of this, except the moments that are expressly about film. The core emotions may be real, but that doesn't make the execution less false.<br/><br/>You say the authenticity of the emotion isn't to be denied. I don't question whether Scorsese personally felt lonely and isolated as a child, but I don't feel loneliness and isolation on the screen—I see a bunch of exaggerated signifiers (Hugo is filthy and his clothes are worn and all the adults yell at him and he regularly gets chased by a scary dog!) and big beats, with shouting and weeping and Spielbergian wonder-emoting. For me, sincerity is more convincing and more personal when it's quiet and direct; when someone's shouting his opinions at me, I assume he's either really angry, or just trying to overwhelm my senses to keep me from expressing my own opinion. Hugo was one long shout, as far as I was concerned.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Why didn't I get that sense of fakery from Amélie, you ask? Actually, I did. I'll completely acknowledge that Amélie and Moulin Rouge are both big, manipulative, artificial constructions in the exact same vein, demanding specific emotions at specific intervals, and trying to sell those emotions with heavy emoting and aggressive soundtrack prodding. Neither of them really sold me on their emotions as authentic human feeling. What I enjoyed in those two films was the construction—particularly Amélie's heady, laughable lists of random characterizing features and experiences for its cast, and Moulin Rouge's musical-magpie mashups and recontextualizations. I'm often sold on stories that do creative or ambitious things with structure, and both of those movies qualify, where Hugo is a much more linear, standard kid-quest.<br/><br/>But in the end, for me, it really does come down to a feeling that those movies are goofs, whereas Hugo is meant to be taken seriously at every treacly moment. You don't think that's true—but you're simultaneously defending its integrity in terms of its absolutely authentic, rooted-in-Scorsese's-history emotion, and telling me I'm wrong, and he doesn't mean it to be taken seriously. How do you reconcile those two statements? What about the film suggests to you that it isn't meant to be taken at face value? And is it possible this is just another Curious Case Of Benjamin Button-like situation where I find the use of kids in big-budget films to be largely sappy and melodramatic, whereas you as a dad find it bypasses your cynicism and goes straight to your family-feeling?<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Scott: Not sure I meant that Scorsese doesn't mean to be taken seriously; it's just that he's chosen a whimsical vehicle through which to express a serious love of the movies. When you say, "But Hugo isn't primarily about film, in spite of the Méliès tie-ins," I'm mystified. I grant that you find many elements of Hugo overly familiar and laborious and full of Spielbergian wonder-emoting—there's nothing I can do to argue around that perception, which other Hugo doubters share. Sometimes a film means to charm and enchant, and it doesn't for some; you've got Hugo and I've got Amélie, though I think the latter, deliberately artificial as it is, means for us to find it romantic. (Rather than, say, some horrible mechanical contraption fit for a Saw sequel.)<br/><br/>But to say Hugo isn't primarily about film? If it's not about film, then it's the most pointlessly discursive story about [whatever you think it's about] I've ever seen. The relationship between Hugo and Méliès is the heart of the movie, and at the heart of that is not just some stock connection between Plucky Orphan and Crusty Old Guy With A Heart Of Gold, but a shared affinity for engineered magic—specifically the magic of the movies. I think Scorsese and his collaborators have found a way to express their enthusiasm over the early days of cinema through a fantasy that's accessible to all ages. The archetype-filled children's tale is the merely the crust here; cinema is the pie. (Mmmm… pie.)<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>As for The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button, I don't see much of a connection, other than trying to expose me as a Benjamin Button defender as a way of damaging my credibility. (Incidentally, how are the extras on that G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra Blu-ray?) I've said to you that the sleep-deprived new dad in me was perhaps vulnerable to Benjamin Button, but I can't imagine a time when the premise of aging in reverse wouldn't move me. (Cradling the love of your life in your arms as an infant? How can you not be affected by that?) And besides, I don't see how Benjamin Button relates much to Hugo as a film concerning kids, since that's just a small segment of a story that spans a much larger trajectory.<br/><br/>So have I convinced you? Likely not. But I'm happy to learn that Hugo wasn't entirely devoid of enchantments for you. The sequences on Méliès the filmmaker are what put Hugo over for me—and in that, at least, we can share some movie love.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Tasha: Nope, I can't say you've convinced me, any more than I've convinced you. It's impossible to argue anyone into a visceral love of anything, and it really should be equally impossible to talk someone down from visceral love. Mostly, you've let me see Hugo in Scott-O-Vision, which is an interesting experience; at least now I'm mildly convinced that we didn't somehow manage to see entirely different films which both somehow had the same name and director.<br/><br/>We certainly had different experiences, though, and to my mind, focused on different aspects of the production: I still don't see the "film is marvelous" theme as the movie's single strand, so much as one among too many. "Pointlessly discursive" almost covers it, though I'd throw in "often needlessly cutesy and precious" on top of that. While you're focused on the film's tasty pie filling, I feel like that pie was covered with a pound of crystallized sugar, and I think that does make a difference, regardless of the film's core message or handful of terrific scenes. See also Benjamin Button, which I did not bring up just to chafe you—I really do think you have more of a sentimental streak than I do regarding children in cinema, especially when they're used more as symbols of vulnerability and innocence than as human characters. Hey, you know what film totally does not have cute wide-eyed moppets bringing hope to a cynical world? G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra. Maybe I will go watch those Blu-ray extras. I could use some explosion-insulin to compensate for Hugo's sweetness. | Sjølv om det er umogeleg å argumentere for at nokon skal elska noko dei hatar, og omvendt, er det likevel ofte triveleg å prøva argumentet. Når vi snakkar med folk som har meiningar som direkte motsier våre, blir vi tvinga til å forsvare vår smak, definere våre meiningar, og analysere kvifor vi reagerer slik vi gjer. Difor har vi Why Don't You Like This?, der to av medarbeidarane våre vil prøve å finne ut om folk med motstridande meiningar kan komme forbi «Nei, du tar feil!» og ha ein sivilisert, konstruktiv og kanskje til og med overbevisende diskusjon om stridspunkta sine. For uansett kva talk radioen seier, er det framleis ein mellomting mellom «vi er heilt samde» og «eg har rett, og du er dum og ond.»<br/><br/>Scott: Sidan me diskuterte min Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World apostasy, har me leita etter ei sak der eg kan kalle deg ut for ikkje å like noko fantastisk, og me treng ikkje å lete lenge. Vi sat rett ved sida av kvarandre under Martin Scorsese sin Hugo—meg, heilt fortryllet av den fantastiske hyllesten til underverka i tidleg stumfilm, og du, tilsynelatande motstår det ved kvar sving. Kritisk konsensus har vore på min side: Det nådde # 9 plass på vår kollektive Topp 15 (selv om du oppførte det som ditt Overrated choice), har vunne (eller plassert) i ulike filmkritikkprisar, og har for tida ein 83 poengsum på Metacritic. Det betyr ikkje at du tar feil, sjølvsagt, men det er opp til deg å forklare kvifor Hugo var, med dine ord, «holt og kunstig», der mange av oss såg på det som ei ljuvleg framstilling av Scorsese si barndom og medium då han framleis var i si barndom. Og ver varsam når du rivar denne sommerfuglen frå kvarandre ved vengene.<br/><br/>Reklame<br/><br/>Tasha: Eg kan ikkje vere mild, Scott. Av og til gjer det mindre vondt om du river av Band-Aid på ein gong. (Og sjølv om det ikkje gjer det, kven vil gå rundt med ein halvrevet Band-Aid? Grovt.) Faktum er at eg fann ut at Hugo var ei leiande manipulativ øving i forfalsking, frå opninga gli gjennom ein togstasjon i Paris, noko som minna meg meir enn noko anna om Robert Zemeckis sin The Polar Express. I motsetnad til Mike D'Angelo, er eg ein fan av lange, ubrotne teke som ein måte å etablere eit rom og oppmuntre sjåarane til å ubevisst halde pusten når eit kamera utforskar eit område; men når rommet som vert utforska er ei glatt, blank CGI-oppretting, og kameraet flyt vektlaust gjennom det utan å sjå noko fysisk kjensle av at verken kameraet eller omgjevnadene verkeleg er der. Og resten av filmen føltes like porøs og uvirkelig for meg, både når det gjaldt innstillinga og den svært konstruerte, maudlin-forteljinga.<br/><br/>Eg har ikkje nødvendigvis problem med fabrikkerte, stiliserte miljø i film. Eg elska Baz Luhrmanns like spreidde, fullstendig kunstige syn på Paris i Moulin Rouge, til dømes, men den filmen har ei kjensle av sin eigen latterligheit, ei sans for humor om kor bevisst over-the-top det er. Ditto stiliseringa av Jean-Pierre Jeunet, særleg i Amélie. (Både Jeunet og Luhrmann følte sterk visuell påverknad her.) Eg fekk likevel ei kjensle av at Martin Scorsese ville at eg skulle ta Hugo heilt på alvor. Sjølv om det er nok ein verkeleg sentimental historie om ein foreldrelaus mor som bringer farge tilbake til livet til ein gretten, gamal curmudgeon. Og eg klarte det ikkje.<br/><br/>Reklame<br/><br/>Det er ingenting eg likar meir med film enn å bli overraska. Og det er ingenting eg misliker og motstår meir enn å bli openlyst manipulert, å bli fortalt høgt kva eg skal føle og når eg skal føle det. Ein god film gjer denne typen ting subtilt; ein dårleg film brukar støytande musikksignal og søte strengar – og i dette tilfellet, ein skitten, storøyd, foreldrelaus som stirrar på kameraet – for å krevje patos, og for å fortelje sjåarane at dei er fæle menneske om dei ikkje serverer det når det blir etterspurt. Når det er sagt, kan eg takle triste born og grettene vaksne som gjer livet betre for kvarandre - eg gravde verkeleg årets Le Havre, som i hovudsak var det same plottet utan all søtleiken - men eg finn dei kunstige omgjevnadane reflekterer dårleg på dei kunstige kjenslene, og kvar av dei får den andre til å verka meir falsk etter tur.<br/><br/>La oss starte med det. I vår oversett filmvideo, tok både du og Noel Keith til oppgåve for å kjempe for Tyrannosaur, fordi du følte at det ikkje var realistisk nok -- for oppdikta, for miserabel, for mykje, for langt. Korleis er det mogleg at ein ikkje kan kjøpa ein stymied gamal sveiv som bryt ting når han er sint, men ein kan kjøpa ein foreldrelaus som bur inne i ein gigantisk togstasjonsklokke og legg ut på ei finurleg reise for å reparere ein mystisk automat som han trur kan bera løyndomar frå den avdøde faren sin, men som i staden fører han på ein særeigen reise av sjølvoppdag, inn i det magiske landet kino. Har du nokon gong funne Hugo sin glorete rokokko-design, aggressive hjartestreng-plukking eller trillebår-laster av særeigenskap til og med litt overdriven eller vanskeleg å svelgje?<br/><br/>Reklame<br/><br/>Scott: Jeunet og Luhrmann som påverknader på Scorsese?! Gløym å vere uhøfleg, no peikar du med vilje på meg med ein skarp pinne. Dersom du ser etter inspirasjon for Hugo – ja, dersom du ser etter den kjenslemessige kjernen i Hugo – må du gå tilbake til barndommen til Scorsese i Elizabeth Street i Little Italy, der ein astmatisk liten gut, ute av stand til å leike med dei andre borna, trekte seg attende til Alexander Korda-fantasiar som The Thief of Bagdad. Eller, rettare sagt, gå rett til kjelda sjølv: George Méliès, som har A Trip To The Moon som big bang av alle filmfantasiar, det augneblinket då kameraet ikkje vart brukt til å dokumentere verda som den er, men uansett kva lunefull, magisk, transporterende stad ein filmskapar ønskjer å finne opp for han. Og den tradisjonen har vore utvikla og utvida i fleire tiår før slike som Jeunet og Luhrmann fekk dei skitne små potene sine på seg.<br/><br/>Og apropos Jeunet, fint forsøk på å ta vekk mitt retoriske våpen, men eg seier det likevel: Korleis kan du elske Amélie, men likevel finne Hugo syntetisk og "overdreven" og "trett manipulerende"? Ein seier at Amélie og Moulin Rouge har «frigjerande sans for sin eigen latterligheit» der Scorsese meiner at vi skal ta Hugo på alvor, og eg trur ikkje det er tilfelle, i alle fall ikkje på det siste punktet. At Scorsese føler ein tydeleg lidenskap for filmane er vel grunnen til at ein tolkar Hugo som sjølvopptatt, men for meg er det kjenslene som gir filmen ein emosjonell ballast som Luhrmann- og Jeunet-filmane ikkje har. Alle tre filmane nyttar seg aggressivt av underverka til CGI—og Scorsese legg til 3D i miksen, til ein fantastisk effekt—men der du og eg er ulike er spørsmålet om vektløyse. Eg er einig i at CGI har ein distanserande effekt; verder som er sett saman heilt av digital plastin er fleksible til eit punkt der dei av og til ikkje har noko nærvær. Du refererte til Hugo i «Overrated»-innspelinga for vårt Best Of Film-stykke som «a CGI gimcrack»—ein perfekt dis... for ein annan film.<br/><br/>Reklame<br/><br/>Det er rettferdig å seie at Scorsese har bygd Hugo kring ei standardutgåve av barneboka/filmen: Foreldrelause saknar faren sin, lagar sin eigen fantasiverd, glamrar seg fast til ein ny ven, og overtalar ein gut til å mjukne til og kanskje adoptere han. Men det er berre det forteljande skjelettet, og Scorsese gjev mykje kjøt og blod. For det første kan ein ikkje sjå på Hugo, den einsame guten, som kikkar ut frå klokketårna til kjaset og maset på ein togstasjon i Paris utan å tenke på Scorsese, ein annan einsam gut, som stirrar ut av soveromsvindauget sitt i Elizabeth Street. Og sjølv om du ikkje er ein stor nok filmnerd til å gjere den samanhengen, føler eg at reisen til Hugo ikkje er å finne ein ny farsfigur, men å halde fram med den mekaniske magien som står som hans eigen farsarv. Det er det filmen er: Persistensen i visjonen som lèt oss akseptere ein illusorisk versjon av verda med 24 bilete per sekund er vitskap og magi på ein gong. Hugo sitt forhold til Méliès handlar ikkje om at han kosar seg fram til ein ny far, men om at han deler ei felles entusiasme som den gamle mannen har vorte nedsenka i bitterhet.<br/><br/>Sjølv dei få kritikarane av filmen ser ut til å vere viljuge til å innrømme at filmhistoria og studioet til Méliès – med Michael Stuhlbarg som den heroiske filmforskaren! – var formidable. Det føltes, på best mogleg måte, som ei berykta komprimering av min History Of Film 101-klasse på college, som kondenserte eit semesters verdi av klipp og samanheng til noko mellom ein montasje og ei animert sprettoppbok. Og det talar til den geniale utforminga av filmen, som lagar fakta og fantasi så vakkert at det samstundes er ei historie om Méliès og fødselen til kinoen, og berre den slags enkle, overdådig produserte filmatiske underverk som Scorsese sjølv ville ha elska som barn. Takk og lov følgjer ikkje Hugo Jeunet/Luhrmann-modellen og har «ein kjensle av sin eigen latterligheit». Som ein fantasy-kjenner sjølv, vil du ikkje seie at det er verdt å spele det rett og oppriktig og uredd i staden for å blunke til publikum? Du kan finne Hugo sjukt søt, men eg trur ikkje at ektheten av hans sentiment skal nektast.<br/><br/>Reklame<br/><br/>Tasha: Ja, eg fann faktisk delar av Hugo fortryllende. (Merk korleis eg svarar på spørsmålet ditt på framsida, medan du var for oppteken med å skumme med apopleksi til å ta opp min, sjølv om eg antar at det er eit svar i seg sjølv. Ok, "påverknad" kan vere å overdrive saka -- eg meinte berre at den visuelle stilen såg veldig kjend ut. Sjølv om, som Keith peikte på då du tok opp dette i person, er Scorsese verken imot å henta inspirasjon frå andre sine bileta, eller immun mot det.) Først og fremst var eg fortryllet av dei delane som handlar om Georges Méliès sin bakgrunnshistorie, med kjærleiken hans til film, med arbeidet han la inn i kunsten sin og gleden han fekk ut av det. Det er skrekkelig mykje skjønnhet og moro i iscenesettinga av undersjøisk-court-scena frå Méliès sin «Fairyland», og i sekvensen på slutten, med fokus på Méliès-opptak. Eg skal seie at Hugo si tilknyting til Méliès over ein felles kjærleik til film er ein fin detalj, og eg likar ein god film om filmskaping.<br/><br/>Men Hugo handlar ikkje først og fremst om film, trass i Méliès-tilknytingane. I tillegg til temaa du siterer, handlar det òg om å finne føremålet ditt, slik karakterane eksplisitt forklarar møysommeleg for kvarandre og for oss. Og det handlar om opptog, og store handlingssett, og jakter, og lykkelig-evig-etter-avslutningar der sjølv den sinte mobbaren og det sjenerte eldre paret og fergawdsakane til og med den grettene dachshunden alle får para seg med sjarmerande kjærleiksinteresser mot slutten. Det handlar om den super-tidlege Hermine Grang-typen som er sjefete, oppkvikket og smart, og som lovprisar den magiske verda som er innkapsla i bøker. Og alt dette er veldig kjent, og veldig kunstig.<br/><br/>Reklame<br/><br/>Ja, Scorsese spelar med arketypar. Problemet er at eg aldri følte han gjennomsyra dei med noko nytt, friskt eller truverdig, trass i sin eigen bakgrunnshistorie. Eg hadde mykje heller hatt ei forteljing om ein ung Scorsese som voks opp med astma – noko små og verkelege, utan store rom fulle av CGI-urverk og gylne glødande støvmotar og profetiske draumar og ein rasande vaksen tyrann-vakt med eit hjarte av gull – alt dette overdimensjonerte, overdimensjonerte tullet. Du siterer heile tida Scorsese sin personlege bakgrunn og kjærleiken til film som bevis på at han verkeleg føler det han set på skjermen, men eg kjenner ikkje den personlege kontakten hans i noko av dette, bortsett frå dei augneblinka som er eksplisitt om film. Kjerneemosjonane kan vere ekte, men det gjer ikkje utføringa mindre falsk.<br/><br/>Du seier at ektheten av kjensla ikkje kan nektast. Eg tvilar ikkje på om Scorsese personleg følte seg einsam og isolert som barn, men eg føler meg ikkje einsam og isolert på skjermen – eg ser ei haug med overdrivne signingar (Hugo er skitten og klærne hans er slitne og alle dei vaksne skriker til han og han vert jamleg jaga av ein skummel hund!) og store beats, med skrik og gråt og spielberg. For meg er oppriktigheit meir overbevisande og meir personleg når det er stille og direkte; når nokon roper sine meiningar mot meg, går eg ut frå at han anten er verkeleg sint, eller berre prøver å overvelde sansane mine for å hindre meg i å uttrykke min eigen meining. Hugo var eitt langt rop, så vidt eg var uroa.<br/><br/>Reklame<br/><br/>Kvifor fekk eg ikkje den kjensla av falskhet frå Amélie, spør du? Eg vil heilt og fullt vedkjenna at Amélie og Moulin Rouge begge er store, manipulative, kunstige konstruksjonar i nøyaktig same vene, krevjande spesifikke kjensler med bestemte intervall, og prøver å selje dei kjenslene med tungt emosjonelt og aggressivt lydspor prodding. Ingen av dei selde meg verkeleg på emosjonane sine som autentisk menneskeleg kjensle. Det eg likte best med dei to filmane var konstruksjonen – særleg dei berykta, lattervekkande listene til Amélie over tilfeldige karaktertrekk og opplevingar for rolla hennar, og Moulin Rouge sine musikk-magpie-mashups og rekontekstualiseringar. Eg blir ofte seld på historier som gjer kreative eller ambisiøse ting med struktur, og begge desse filmane kvalifiserer, der Hugo er ein mykje meir lineær, standard kid-quest.<br/><br/>Men til slutt, for meg, kjem det eigentleg ned til ei kjensle av at desse filmane er tulle, medan Hugo er meint å bli teken på alvor i kvart einaste svikefulle augneblink. Du trur ikkje det er sant -- men du forsvarer samstundes integriteten hans når det gjeld den heilt autentiske, rotfesta Scorsese-historia hans, og seier til meg at eg tek feil, og han meiner ikkje at han skal bli teken på alvor. Korleis forenar du dei to påstandane? Kva tyder filmen for deg på at den ikkje er meint å bli teken for pålydande? Og er det mogleg at dette berre er ein nysgjerrig Case Of Benjamin Button-liknande situasjon der eg finn bruken av born i big-budget-filmar stort sett sappy og melodramatisk, medan du som far finn at det omgår kynismen din og går rett til familiekjenslene dine?<br/><br/>Reklame<br/><br/>Scott: Ikkje sikker på at eg meinte at Scorsese ikkje meinte å bli teken seriøst; det er berre at han har valt eit finurleg kjøretøy for å uttrykke ein seriøs kjærleik til filmane. Når ein seier, "Men Hugo handlar ikkje primært om film, trass i Méliès-tilknytingane," er eg mystifisert. Eg innrømmer at du finn mange element av Hugo som er altfor kjende og møysommelege og fulle av Spielberg-aktig underverk-det er ingenting eg kan gjøre for å argumentere rundt den oppfatninga, som andre Hugo-tvilarar deler. Av og til betyr ein film å sjarmere og fortrylle, og det gjer den ikkje for nokre; du har Hugo og eg har Amélie, men eg trur at det siste, med vilje kunstig som det er, betyr at me finn det romantisk. (I staden for, la oss seie, noko fælt mekanisk utstyr passa for ein Saw-oppfølgjar.)<br/><br/>Men for å seie at Hugo ikkje først og fremst handlar om film? Dersom det ikkje handlar om film, så er det den mest meningsløst diskursive historia eg nokon gong har sett. Forholdet mellom Hugo og Méliès er i hjartet av filmen, og i hjartet av det er ikkje berre ein del av tilknytinga mellom Plucky Orphan og Crusty Old Guy With A Heart Of Gold, men ein felles tilknyting til konstruert magi—særleg magien i filmane. Eg trur Scorsese og medarbeidarane hans har funne ein måte å uttrykkje entusiasmen sin gjennom dei tidlege filmdagane gjennom ein fantasi som er tilgjengeleg for alle aldersgrupper. Den arketypefylte barneforteljinga er berre skorpa her; kinoen er paien. (Mmm... pai.)<br/><br/>Reklame<br/><br/>Når det gjeld The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button, ser eg ikkje mykje av ein samanheng, anna enn å prøve å avsløre meg som ein Benjamin Button-forsvarar som ein måte å skade trua mi. (Forresten, korleis er statister på den G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra Blu-ray?) Eg har sagt til deg at den søvnberøvde nye faren i meg kanskje var sårbar for Benjamin Button, men eg kan ikkje forestille meg ei tid då premissen om å eldast i revers ikkje ville røre meg. Korleis kan ein ikkje bli påverka av det?) Og forresten, eg ser ikkje korleis Benjamin Button forholder seg mykje til Hugo som ein film om born, sidan det berre er eit lite segment av ei historie som spenner over ein mykje større bane.<br/><br/>Så har eg overtalt deg? Sannsynligvis ikkje. Men eg er glad for å få vite at Hugo ikkje var heilt fortryllende for deg. Sekvensane om filmskaparen Méliès er det som sette Hugo over for meg — og i det minste kan vi dele litt filmkjærleik.<br/><br/>Reklame<br/><br/>Tasha: Nope, eg kan ikkje seie at du har overtydd meg, meir enn eg har overtydd deg. Det er umogleg å argumentere nokon inn i ein visceral kjærleik til noko, og det burde verkeleg vere like umogleg å snakke nokon ned frå visceral kjærleik. For det meste har du latt meg sjå Hugo i Scott-O-Vision, noko som er ei interessant oppleving; i det minste no er eg mildt overtydd om at me på ein eller annan måte ikkje klarte å sjå heilt forskjellige filmar som både på ein eller annan måte hadde same namn og regissør.<br/><br/>Vi hadde sikkert ulike opplevingar, og etter mi meining fokuserte vi på ulike sider ved produksjonen: Eg ser framleis ikkje «filmen er fantastisk»-temaet som filmen sin eine tråd, så mykje som ein blant for mange. «Punktlessly diskursive» dekkjer nesten til det, sjølv om eg ville kasta inn «ofte unødvendig søtt og dyrebart» på toppen av det. Medan du er fokusert på den velsmakande paifyllinga i filmen, føler eg at paien var dekt med eit pund krystallisert sukker, og eg trur det gjer ein forskjell, uavhengig av filmens kjernemelding eller handfull fabelaktige scener. Sjå òg Benjamin Button, som eg ikkje tok opp berre for å sjikanere deg - eg trur verkeleg at du har meir av ein sentimental strek enn eg har når det gjeld barn på kino, særleg når dei vert brukt meir som symbol på sårbarheit og uskuld enn som menneskelege karakterar. G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra. Kanskje eg skal gå og sjå dei Blu-ray statister. Eg kunne trengt litt eksplosjonsinsulin for å kompensere for Hugos søtheit. |
| "I hoped my daughter would be free from difficult and troubling times": Mee Mee's story as a refugee Mom<br/><br/>Hope in Times of Crisis: A Mother's Day Story<br/><br/>By Judith Santiago*<br/><br/>Mee Mee heard that the soldiers were coming. She took hold of her son and frantically joined the rest of the villagers who were running toward the Thai-Burmese border, where the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) was located. Her husband was in another village running in the opposite direction, Mee later learned. After the soldiers' pursuit ended, Mee returned home to her small village in Koechi, Burma.<br/><br/>During 1997-2000, Mee and thousands like her lived under the constant threat of violence from Burmese soldiers. Many people would take temporary refuge in the jungle, and return home to their village after soldiers left the area, just to do it all over again days later. About once a week, Mee and others would be on the move to avoid capture, rape, or death by soldiers.<br/><br/>During one incident, Mee's husband ran ahead of his wife to secure food for his family. Her husband was spotted by soldiers and shot. The bullet shattered a portion of his ribcage, leaving him severely wounded and in distress as he journeyed toward the jungle with his family for safety.<br/><br/>For three months, Mee's husband hid and moved the family with an exasperating wound at his side. He received no medical care, except for Mee's tending.<br/><br/>"I was afraid to return to Burma," Mee said through an interpreter. "I feared dying. I cried and cried every day," she continued.<br/><br/>Mee's husband eventually drew enough strength to walk five days toward a small village in Thailand where they learned the location of a hospital and a refugee camp. When Mee and her husband finally arrived at the hospital, he underwent immediate surgery and later recovered.<br/><br/>Symbol of Hope<br/><br/>Life in the jungle for those fleeing Burmese soldiers was indeed terrifying and difficult. Makeshift bamboo tents with only roof and floor coverings became suitable temporary dwellings. Many women including Mee gave birth to children in the jungle. Mee's then six-year-old son assisted in the delivery of his sister named Eh Ku Hser. Her name means love – cold – sweet. "Cold" in Burmese culture means so as to not pass through the fire of life, as heat represents troubled times.<br/><br/>"I hoped my daughter would be free from difficult and troubling times," said Mee. "I did not want her to go through what I had experienced," she continued.<br/><br/>For Mee, the birth of her daughter in the midst of darkness, torment and fear, was a symbol of hope for a new life to come. Hope in times of crisis, the very premise of the United Methodist Committee on Relief's (UMCOR) newly co-branded UMCOR-Prosperity Candle, is also the essence of that which candles shed light upon.<br/><br/>A New Beginning<br/><br/>With the help of UNHCR, hope for a new life did indeed materialize for Mee and her family when they resettled in West Springfield, Massachusetts. There, Mee met Moo Kho Paw, another woman who emigrated from Burma, and who was working at Prosperity Candle in Florence. The organization helps refugee women who have escaped areas of conflict rebuild their lives through the art of candle making. Moo Kho recommended that Mee join the organization, and Mee gladly accepted.<br/><br/>"I was excited to be out of the house," said Mee, "I was raised to believe that because I was a woman, my role was to remain at home and raise my family," she continued. "While many Burmese women want to do more for themselves, they are often encouraged to remain homemakers."<br/><br/>Today, Mee has plans to go into the candle-making business for herself and support her five children, but she expressed the need to learn English first.<br/><br/>"In the Thai refugee camp, we had education, but it was not so good," said Mee. "When I was a child, I wanted to go to school, but I was told to stay home because I was a woman. Now, I have hopes for my daughters to go to college and become doctors or policewomen," continued Mee.<br/><br/>Mee has struck an even balance in her life that she wishes others would have found—a simple, happy life where work, caring for family members and freedom of choice all have their place.<br/><br/>Support Refugee Women in the US<br/><br/>Share this Mother's Day story with your loved ones. And, when you purchase handmade candles by Mee, Moo Kho, and Naw, another Burmese refugee woman working at Prosperity Candle , know you are helping to support their livelihood as they rebuild their lives and those of their family members in the US. | «Eg håpte dottera mi skulle bli fri frå vanskelege og urolege tider»: Mee Mees historie som flyktningmamma<br/><br/>Det første spelet kom ut i 1987 med namnet Hope in Times of Crisis .<br/><br/>Av Judith Santiago*<br/><br/>Mee Mee høyrde at soldatane kom. Ho tok tak i sonen sin og slo seg febrilsk saman med resten av landsbybuarane som flykta mot den thai-burmesiske grensa, der kontoret til FNs høgkommissær for flyktningar (UNHCR) låg. Etter at forfølginga til soldatane var over, drog Mee heim til den vesle landsbyen sin i Koechi i Burma.<br/><br/>I perioden 1997-2000 levde Mee og tusenvis som ho under konstant trugsel om vald frå burmesiske soldatar. Mange ville ta midlertidig tilflukt i jungelen, og vende heim til landsbyen sin etter at soldatar hadde forlate området, berre for å gjere det om att nokre dagar seinare. Om lag ein gong i veka skulle Mee og andre vere på farten for å unngå å bli tekne til fange, voldteke eller drepe av soldatar.<br/><br/>Under ei hending sprang mannen til Mee i forkant av kona for å sikre mat til familien, og mannen hennar vart sett av soldatar og skoten. Kula knuste ein del av ribbeina hans, og etterlét han alvorleg såra og i naud då han reiste mot jungelen med familien for tryggleik.<br/><br/>I tre månader gøymde mannen til Mee seg og flytta familien med eit forverrande sår ved sida av seg.<br/><br/>«Eg var redd for å fara tilbake til Burma», sa Mee gjennom ein tolk. «Eg var redd for å døy, eg gret og gret kvar dag,» heldt ho fram.<br/><br/>Ektemannen til Mee trekte etter kvart til seg nok styrke til å gå fem dagar mot ein liten landsby i Thailand der dei fekk vite plasseringa av eit sjukehus og ein flyktningleir. Då Mee og mannen til slutt kom til sjukehuset, gjennomgikk han ein operasjon og vart seinare frisk.<br/><br/>Symbol på håp<br/><br/>Livet i jungelen for dei som flykta frå burmesiske soldatar var frykteleg og vanskeleg. Makeshift bambustelt med berre tak- og golvdekke vart eigna til midlertidige bustader. Mange kvinner, inkludert Mee, fødde born i jungelen. Den då seks år gamle sonen til Mee assisterte i fødselen til søstera hans, Eh Ku Hser. Namnet hennar tyder kjærleik – kald – søt. «Kald» i burmesisk kultur tyder å ikkje gå gjennom elden i livet, sidan varme representerer urolege tider.<br/><br/>«Eg håpte dottera mi skulle bli fri frå vanskelege og urolege tider», sa Mee. «Eg ville ikkje at ho skulle gå gjennom det eg hadde opplevd», heldt ho fram.<br/><br/>For Mee var fødselen av dottera hennar midt i mørke, pine og frykt, eit symbol på håp om eit nytt liv. Hope i krisetider, sjølve premissen til United Methodist Committee on Relief's (UMCOR) nyleg co-branda UMCOR-Prosperity Candle, er òg essensen av det som lysa lyser på.<br/><br/>Ein ny start<br/><br/>Med hjelp frå UNHCR fekk Mee og familien hennar eit håp om eit nytt liv då dei slo seg ned i West Springfield i Massachusetts. Der møtte Mee Moo Kho Paw, ei anna kvinne som emigrerte frå Burma, og som arbeidde ved Prosperity Candle i Firenze. Organisasjonen hjelper flyktningkvinner som har rømt frå konfliktområde, med å gjenoppbygge liva sine gjennom kunsten å laga stearinlys. Moo Kho tilrådde at Mee skulle bli med i organisasjonen, og Mee tok gjerne imot.<br/><br/>«Eg var spent på å vere ute av huset», sa Mee, «Eg vart oppdratt til å tru at fordi eg var kvinne, var rolla mi å vera heime og oppdra familien min», heldt ho fram. «Mens mange burmesiske kvinner ynskjer å gjere meir for seg sjølve, blir dei ofte oppmuntra til å halde seg heime.»<br/><br/>I dag har Mee planar om å gå inn i stearinlysindustrien for seg sjølv og støtte dei fem borna sine, men ho uttrykte behov for å lære engelsk først.<br/><br/>«I den thailandske flyktningleiren hadde vi utdanning, men det var ikkje så bra», sa Mee. «Da eg var barn, ville eg gå på skulen, men eg fekk beskjed om å vera heime fordi eg var kvinne. No har eg håp om at døtrene mine skal gå på college og bli legar eller politikvinner, fortset Mee.<br/><br/>Mee har funne ein jamn balanse i livet sitt som ho ynskjer at andre skal ha funne – eit enkelt og gledeleg liv der arbeid, omsorg for familiar og valfridom alle har sin plass.<br/><br/>Flyktningkvinner i USA<br/><br/>Del denne morsdagsforteljinga med dine kjære. Og når du kjøper handlagde stearinlys av Mee, Moo Kho og Naw, ei anna burmesisk flyktningkvinne som arbeider på Prosperity Candle , veit du at du er med på å støtte levebrødet deira når dei gjenoppbygger liva sine og familiemedlemmane sine i USA. |
| The Precedency Essay<br/><br/>1562 words - 7 pages<br/><br/>Affirmative action is a government policy that gives opportunities to minorities, women, and any group who has been the victim of discrimination in the past. Affirmative action is the outcome of the 1960's Civil Rights movement, growing out of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 which outlawed discrimination based on race, ethnicity, or gender. It was the 1978 Supreme Court decision, The Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, which allowed for the use of race-based preferences as a means of fostering diversity, allowing affirmative action to be used in admissions policies. It was created with the intention to provide equal opportunities for members of minority groups in education and ...view middle of the document...<br/><br/>However, according to a 2007 report by the Pew Research Center, support for affirmative action among the American public has actually increased substantiallyin recent years, climbing from 58% in 1995 to 70% in 2007. Supporters of affirmative action make many arguments in support of affirmative action, in the hopes of getting others to see the genuine good that affirmative actin policies bring to our society. Supporters believe that affirmative action is more of a process rather than an admissions policy. Colleges and universities take the extra initiative to reach out to minority groups, encouraging them to apply. Colleges and universities offer additional financial aid and provide on-campus resources to help better the student's college education. Supporters also note the rising number of minority applications to colleges and universities due in part to affirmative action policies.<br/>Statistics have proven that when affirmative action is eliminated, such as when it was at Berkley College and UCLA in 1998, the minority student admissions fell 61 percent and 36 percent respectively, proving that affirmative action plays a major role in a minority students college admissions process. Affirmative action supporters also believe that diversity in higher education provides a better educational atmosphere for all students, personally and intellectually. If affirmative action were to be eliminated, there would be fewer minority students enrolled in colleges, causing diversity to be fairly slim. Affirmative action policies are also necessary in order to compensate for centuries of racial, economic, and social oppression. Individuals with a higher socioeconomic status have more opportunities than those of lower socioeconomic backgrounds. Supporters believe that certain racial or ethnic groups are disadvantaged because they are frequently in lower income households and consequently are not exposed to the same resources as students from higher socioeconomic classes. Advocates support the notion of competition between students based on merit, but argue that affirmative action compensates for economic differences. College graduates, who have benefitted from affirmative action, have also said that they received better jobs, earned more money, and overall live better lives because of the fortunate opportunities they received through affirmative action.<br/>Supporters of affirmative action continuously stress the severe importance of affirmative action, considering its contributions to enhancing both the college experience and society in general. However, opponents of affirmative action believe that the time has come to end affirmative action. Opponents believe affirmative action was created to ensure fair admission practices to bring change to a long period of racial discrimination. They believe the policy is outdated."It's time to pull the plug on race-based decision making," says Ward Connerly, a Sacramento, California businessman and lead organizer of...<br/><br/>Find Another Essay On The Precedency<br/><br/>754 words - 4 pages<br/>of the burden to continue prospering.

Bekreftande handling er resultatet av borgarrettsrørsla i 1960-åra, som voks ut av borgarrettslova av 1964 som forbaud diskriminering basert på rase, etnisitet eller kjønn. Det var Høgsteretts avgjerd frå 1978, The Regents of University of California mot Bakke, som tillét bruk av rasebaserte preferanser som eit middel til å fremje mangfald, slik at positiv særbehandling kunne brukast i opptakspolitikk. Det vart oppretta med det føremål å gje like moglegheiter for medlemmer av minoritetsgrupper i utdanning og ...view middle of the document...<br/><br/>Men i følgje ein rapport frå 2007 frå Pew Research Center har støtta for positiv særstilling i den amerikanske offentlegheita auka vesentleg dei siste åra, frå 58 % i 1995 til 70 % i 2007. Tilhengjarar av positiv handling gjer mange argument til støtte for positiv handling, i håp om å få andre til å sjå det genuine gode som positiv handlingspolitikk fører med seg til samfunnet vårt. Tilhengjarar meiner at affirmative action er meir ein prosess enn ein opptakspolitikk. Høgskular og universitet tar det ekstra initiativet til å nå ut til minoritetsgrupper, og oppmodar dei til å søkje. Høgskular og universitet tilbyr ytterlegare økonomisk støtte og ressursar på campus for å bidra til betre høgskuleutdanning. Tilhengjarar legg òg merke til det aukande talet på minoritetssøknader til høgskular og universitet, delvis på grunn av positiv særstilling.<br/>Statistikk har vist at når bekreftende tiltak er eliminert, som då det var ved Berkley College og UCLA i 1998, fall minoritetsstudentopptaka med 61 prosent og 36 prosent, noko som viser at bekreftende tiltak spelar ei stor rolle i ein minoritetsstudents collegeopptaksprosess. Tilhengjarar av bekreftende tiltak meiner òg at mangfaldet i høgare utdanning gir ein betre pedagogisk atmosfære for alle studentar, både personleg og intellektuelt. Dersom positive tiltak skulle bli eliminert, ville det vere færre minoritetsstudentar på høgskular, noko som førte til at mangfaldet vart nokså tynt. For å kompensere for fleire hundreår med rasemessig, økonomisk og sosial undertrykking, er det òg naudsynt med positiv handlingspolitikk. Personar med høgare sosioøkonomisk status har fleire moglegheiter enn dei med lågare sosioøkonomisk bakgrunn. Tilhengjarar meiner at visse rasemessige eller etniske grupper er ufordelaktige fordi dei ofte er i låginntektshushald og dermed ikkje er utsett for dei same ressursane som studentar frå høgare sosioøkonomiske klassar. Talsmenn støttar forestillingen om konkurranse mellom studentar basert på meritt, men argumenterer for at positiv handling kompenserer for økonomiske skilnader. Høgskolestudentar, som har hatt nytte av positiv særbehandling, har òg sagt at dei fekk betre jobbar, tente meir pengar og generelt levde betre liv på grunn av dei heldige høve dei fekk gjennom positiv særbehandling.<br/>Tilhengjarar av bekreftende handling legg kontinuerleg vekt på den alvorlege tydinga av bekreftende handling, med tanke på bidraga til å forbetre både høgskuleopplevinga og samfunnet generelt. Motstandarar av affirmative action meiner likevel at tida er inne for å avslutte affirmative action, medan motstandarar meiner at affirmative action blei skapt for å sikre rettferdig opptakspraksis for å få til endring i ein lang periode med rasediskriminering. Dei meiner politikken er utdatert.» Det er på tide å trekkje pluggen på rasebasert vedtak, seier Ward Connerly, ein forretningsmann frå Sacramento i California og leiande organisator av...<br/><br/>Finn eit anna essay om presedensen<br/><br/>754 ord - 4 sider av byrden for å halde fram med å bløme.

| Combinations<br/><br/>Combinations Are defenses against a punch, choreographed responses to different types of attacks. They have many names across the martial arts but (in my experience) every art has a version of them. This makes them different than forms because there are plenty of martial arts that have no forms. What makes there partner exercises so universal? Why practice a specific response when (in reality) timing, type of attack, size of the attacker, and a hundred other factors will make it so you never use that entire choreographed response? And finally, how can we practice for a real defense situation and avoid injury at the same time?<br/><br/>The universality of combinations is impressive, to say the least. Our style of Kenpo karate has a list of 108 combos that can be learned. (Most students only learn 20-30 though) In Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu you spend whole classes practicing arm bars and chokes, learning every subtlety to the move while your partner offers little to no resistance. Every boxer has spent hours in front of the bag and/or mirror throwing the same combination of punches until their body moves by reflex alone. Combinations are universal because we have no better way to introduce movement and then practice the subtle positions required to make them work. Hitting a small pressure point through clothing takes A LOT of practice, catching an arm bar with control requires a carefully placed hip and a sneaky setup, and a great combination is only useful if you can through it from a balanced and protected position. Can you think of a better way to gain these skills?<br/><br/>There is any number of factors that determine how you respond to an attack and whether in a sparring match or in a fight, I have NEVER used a full combination in my defense. Why, then, do we spend hours practicing them? We practice these choreographed responses because the objective is not to pull combination 8 out every time you see a hook punch but to show you one way of blocking it and then a possible way to follow it up. I have never chosen to use combination 3 in a reality situation but the block is one of my go-to moves. Combinations add tools to the toolbox they do not fix the car.<br/><br/>The last question is a question of safety. If we practice for the sake of reality we need to replicate reality. How do we prevent injury while doing so? When it comes down to it, it's about building trust. We start slow and learn to trust that we have control over ourselves. We learn to trust our partners have control as well. In more time we learn to trust our control over our partner and (a little scarier) we learn to trust our partner's control over us. In the end (with a lot of practice) you can move are full speed, tossing your partner, and being thrown without fear of injury.<br/><br/>Combinations are universal for a reason; they are practiced so they can be dissected into their parts, and we stay safe by starting slow and building trust. As with everything else in the martial arts, combinations have many reasons behind their practice and execution. | Kombinasjonar<br/><br/>Kombinasjonar er forsvar mot slag, koreograferte svar på ulike typar angrep. Dei har mange namn på tvers av kampsport, men (i min erfaring) har kvar kunst ein versjon av dei. Dette gjer dei annleis enn former fordi det er mange kampsportar som ikkje har former. Kva er det som gjer partnarøvingar så universelle? Kvifor øve på eit spesifikt svar når (i røynda) timing, type angrep, storleiken på angriparen og hundre andre faktorar vil gjere det slik at du aldri brukar heile det koreograferte svaret? Og til slutt, korleis kan vi øve for ein verkeleg forsvarssituasjon og unngå skade på same tid?<br/><br/>Kombinasjonane er minst sagt universelle. Vår stil av kenpo karate har ei liste over 108 komboar som kan lærast. (Dei fleste elevane lærer berre 20-30) I brasiliansk jiu-jitsu brukar du heile klassar på å øva på armlener og choker, og lærer deg alle finesser til flyttinga medan partneren din tilbyr lite eller ingen motstand. Kvar boksar har brukt timar framfor sekken og/eller spegelen på å kasta same kombinasjon av slag til kroppen rører seg ved hjelp av refleks aleine. Kombinasjonar er universelle fordi vi ikkje har nokon betre måte å innføre rørsle på og så øve på dei subtile posisjonane som trengst for å få dei til å fungere. Å slå eit lite trykkpunkt gjennom klede tek MYE øving, å fange ei armbøyle med kontroll krev ei nøye plassert hofte og eit sleipt oppsett, og ein flott kombinasjon er berre nyttig om ein kan gjennomføra det frå ein balansert og verna posisjon. Kan du tenkje på ein betre måte å få desse ferdigheitene på?<br/><br/>Det er fleire faktorar som avgjer korleis du reagerer på eit angrep, og om eg i ein sparringskamp eller i ein kamp ALDRI har brukt ein full kombinasjon i forsvaret mitt. Så kvifor brukar vi timesvis på å øve dei? Vi øver på desse koreograferte svara fordi målet ikkje er å trekke kombinasjon 8 ut kvar gong du ser ein krokslag, men å vise deg ein måte å blokkere det på og så ein mogleg måte å følgje det opp på. Eg har aldri valt å bruka kombinasjon 3 i ein verkelegheitssituasjon, men blokka er eit av mine go-to trekk. Kombinasjonar legg til verktøy i verktøykassa dei rettar ikkje bilen.<br/><br/>Det siste spørsmålet er eit spørsmål om tryggleik. Dersom vi øvar for verkelegheita si skuld, treng vi å gjenskape verkelegheita. Korleis unngår vi skade når vi gjer det? Når det kjem til det, handlar det om å byggje tillit. Vi byrjar sakte og lærer å stole på at vi har kontroll over oss sjølve. Vi lærer å stole på at partnarane våre har kontroll òg. I meir tid lærer vi å stole på at vi har kontroll over partnarane våre og (litt skummare) lærer vi å stole på at partnarane våre har kontroll over oss. Til slutt (med mykje øving) kan ein røra seg i full fart, kasta partneren sin og bli kasta utan frykt for skade.<br/><br/>Kombinasjonar er universelle av ein grunn; dei blir praktiserte slik at dei kan dissekerast inn i delane sine, og me held oss trygge ved å starte sakte og bygge tillit. Som med alt anna i kampsporten, har kombinasjonar mange grunnar til at dei blir praktiserte og utførte. |
