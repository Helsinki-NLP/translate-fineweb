Undocumented migrants have nothing. They are not allowed to work. They have no right to state benefits nor to a place to live. They are unseen and potentially the most vulnerable group in the UK today.<br/><br/>Undocumented (or irregular) migrants include those trafficked into the sex trade or for domestic servitude; they include visa overstayers; those whose asylum applications have been refused and others who have been subject to failures in the immigration system. All of these may originally have come to the UK legally.<br/><br/>'Illegal immigrants' – those imagined to have entered the country in the backs of lorries – make up a small proportion of the undocumented.<br/><br/>Indeed some sources suggest that half the estimated 120,000 undocumented children in the UK were actually born here to undocumented parents. These children are disadvantaged from birth, solely by their immigration status.<br/><br/>The blog tells the stories of the undocumented. It highlights their daily struggles and vulnerabilities, but also their strength and resilience. It's not an easy read.<br/><br/>You can access the blog via our website (bottom of right hand column on Home Page).<br/><br/>The blog has won the online category of the Speaking Together media awards. The awards were a new addition this year to the Migrant and Refugee Woman of the Year Awards celebration at the Royal Festival Hall in London as part of International Women's Day. The panel of judges – including novelist and playwright Gillian Slovo, and journalist and author, Hannah Pool – was particularly looking for work that challenged myths and stereotypes.<br/><br/>The blog has also won the Blog North Awards 2013 in the Best Writing category and was also shortlisted for an Amnesty International Media Award. | Innleggsnavigasjon<br/><br/>«Life Without Papers» vann ein Oscar for beste manus.<br/><br/>Bloggprosjektet "Life Without Papers", laga av Len Grant, inneheld historier om papirlause flyktningfamiliar og unge menneske. Papirlause flyktningar har ingenting. Dei har ikkje lov til å arbeide. Dei har ikkje rett til å gi stønad eller til ein stad å bu. Dei er usynlege og potensielt den mest sårbare gruppa i Storbritannia i dag.<br/><br/>Udokumenterte (eller irregulære) immigrantar inkluderer dei som vert smugla inn i sexhandel eller for husarbeid; dei inkluderer visumutlendingar; dei som har fått avslag på asylsøknad og andre som har vore utsette for svikt i innvandringssystemet. Alle desse kan opphavleg ha kome til Storbritannia lovleg.<br/><br/>«Illegale immigrantar» – dei som ein trudde kom inn i landet i baksetet på lastebilar – utgjer ein liten del av dei udokumenterte.<br/><br/>Faktisk hevdar nokre kjelder at halvparten av dei estimerte 120 000 udokumenterte borna i Storbritannia faktisk vart fødd her av udokumenterte foreldre. Desse borna er ufordelaktige frå fødselen, berre på grunn av innvandringsstatusen deira.<br/><br/>Bloggen fortel historier om dei udokumenterte. Den framhevar deira daglege kampar og sårbarheiter, men også deira styrke og motstandskraft. Det er ikkje lett å lese.<br/><br/>Bloggen er tilgjengeleg via heimesida vår (nederst til høgre på heimesida).<br/><br/>Bloggen har vunne den nettbaserte kategorien Speaking Together media awards. Prisene var eit nytt tillegg i år til Årets migrant- og flyktningkvinne-prisfeiring i Royal Festival Hall i London som ein del av den internasjonale kvinnedagen. Dommarpanelet – inkludert romanforfattaren og dramatikaren Gillian Slovo, og journalisten og forfattaren Hannah Pool – var særleg på utkikk etter arbeid som utfordra mytar og stereotypar.<br/><br/>Bloggen har òg vunne Blog North Awards 2013 i kategorien Best Writing og vart òg nominert til ein Amnesty International Media Award. |
| Sabbath School Lesson<br/><br/>In Galatians, Paul tackles issues such as freedom, the role of the law in salvation, our condition in Christ, and the nature of the Spirit-led life, as well as the age-old question, How can sinful humans be made right before a holy and just God?<br/><br/>Many scholars believe that Galatians may be the earliest of Paul's letters. It was written in A.D. 49, shortly after the famous Jerusalem Council (Acts 15). Therefore, the book may be the oldest Christian document known. As Acts and Galatians make clear, the early church found itself in a fierce battle over the nature of salvation, especially in the case of Gentiles. According to a group of Jewish believers, known as Judaizers, belief in Jesus alone was not good enough for Gentiles. Gentiles must also be circumcised and follow the laws of Moses (Acts 15:1).<br/><br/>This quarter's Bible study guide invites us to journey with the apostle Paul as he pleads with the Galatians to remain true to Jesus. It also gives us a chance to reflect on our own understanding of the truths that opened the way for Martin Luther's ultimate break with Rome and the restoration of the biblical gospel. | Sabbatskuleleksjon<br/><br/>I Galatarane tek Paulus opp spørsmål som fridom, lova si rolle i frelsen, vår tilstand i Kristus og naturen av det åndelege livet, samt det eldgamle spørsmålet: Korleis kan syndige menneske bli rettferdige for ein heilag og rettferdig Gud?<br/><br/>Mange forskarar meiner at galatarane kan vere det tidlegaste av breva til Paulus. Det vart skrive i år 49 e.Kr., kort tid etter det kjende Jerusalemkonsilet (Apg 15). Derfor kan boka vera det eldste kristne dokumentet ein kjenner til. Som Apostlenes-gjerningar og Galatarane gjer det klart, fann den første kyrkja seg i ein hard kamp om naturen til frelse, spesielt i tilfelle av heidningane. I følgje ei gruppe av jødiske truande, kjend som judaistar, var trua på Jesus åleine ikkje god nok for heidningane, men heidningane måtte òg omskjerast og følgje Moselova (Apg 15,1).<br/><br/>Bibelstudieguiden til dette kvartalet inviterer oss til å reise saman med apostelen Paulus når han ber galatarane om å vera trufaste mot Jesus. Det gjev oss òg høve til å reflektere over vår eigen forståing av sanningane som opna vegen for Martin Luther sitt endelege brot med Roma og gjenopprettinga av det bibelske evangeliet. |

Før han overtok trona var han guvernør i Hannover frå 1776 til 1786. Den 11. desember 1752 døydde onkelen hans, Adolf Fredrik III, og den eldre broren til Karl etterfølgde han som Adolf Fredrik IV. Med brørne sine vart Karl teken med resten av familien frå Mirow til hovudstaden Strelitz, og frå han var fire år gammal såg Karl ut til å vere klar for ein karriere i Hannover-teneste etter å ha fått ein kapteinskommisjon. Søstera Charlotte gifta seg med kurfyrsten av Hannover, kong Georg III av Storbritannia den 8. september 1761, hausten 1776 vart Karl utnemnd til generalguvernør av Hannover av svogeren sin. Som guvernør i Hannover hadde Karl i praksis all makta til ein suveren herskar og svogeren hans hadde ikkje noko ønskje om å bu i Tyskland, sidan han var fullstendig engelsk. Kort tid etter å ha vorte enkje ei tid i desember 1785, bad Karl om løyve til å trekkje seg tilbake frå dei militære verva sine i Hannover. Svigerbroren hans innvilga kravet og forfremma Karl til rang av feltmarskalk, og Karl reiste så ei stund før han slo seg ned i Darmstadt, der han vart president for den keisarlege kredittkommisjonen. Etter at den eldre broren hans Adolf Friedrich IV døydde barnlaus den 2. juni 1794, som herskar, oppmuntra Karl til nye landbrukstendensar, etablerte ein ny politistyrke og innførte obligatorisk utdanning.

Den 12. november 1826 vart Fredrik hertug av Sachsen-Altenburg, som han gav ei første grunnlov i år 1831, i byte mot media knytt til Fredrik, hertug av Sachsen-Altenburg ved Wikimedia Commons geneall. net<br/><br/>Fredrik, hertug av Sachsen-Altenburg<br/>–<br/>Fredrik<br/><br/>15.<br/>Hertuginne Charlotte Georgine av Mecklenburg-Strelitz<br/>–<br/>Charlotte Georgine var fødd i Hannover i kurfyrstedømet Brunswick-Lüneburg. Ho var det eldste barnet og dottera til Karl II, storhertug av Mecklenburg, Charlotte og søstrene hennar, dronning Louise av Preussen, dronning Fredrika av Hannover og prinsesse Therese av Thurn und Taxis, vart rekna som dei vakraste kvinnene i si tid. Jean Paul Friedrich Richter dediserte romanen Titan til dei fire vakre, Charlotte voks opp i Hannover, der faren hennar fungerte som guvernør, på vegner av svogeren sin, kong Georg III av Storbritannia, som budde i London. Då Charlotte var tolv år gammal døydde mora og ho vart oppdratt av morssøsteren Charlotte, som gifta seg med faren i 1784 og søstrene hennar vart tekne med av bestemora Maria Louise Albertine av Leiningen-Falkenburg-Dagsburg i Darmstadt. Den 3. september 1785, då Charlotte var femten år gammal, gifta ho seg med hertug Fredrik, hertug av Sachsen-Altenburg. Ekteskapet var ikkje godt, Charlotte var mentalt overlegen Fredrik, som byrja å oversjå henne. Dei hadde òg problem, Sachsen-Hildburghausen hadde vorte økonomisk ruinert av den katastrofale politikken til Fredrik sine forgjengarar. Mottakarane tillét berre hertugen og hertuginna ei redusert borgarliste, Charlottes far og to brør vart ofte verande hos Charlotte i Hildburghausen. I 1787 flytta ho til Hildburghausen for godt, og vart formann i kredittkomiteen. I 1792 flykta Charlottes bestemor og søstrene hennar frå den framrykkande franske armeen frå Darmstadt til Hildburghausen og bestemora la merke til mannen hennar. Av alle sine plikter oppfyller han sine ekteskaplege plikter med iver. Charlotte, som aldri elska denne mannen, er alltid gravid, familien tilbrakte fleire sorglause veker på Hildburghausen. I 1793 kom Charlottes bestemor tilbake frå eksil og reiste med Charlottes søstre til Frankfurt am Main. Charlotte hadde eit svært intimt og kjærleiksfullt forhold til systera Friederike og slektningar i Strelitz. I 1803 og 1805 vitja det prøyssiske kongeparet Hildburghausen, for denne anledningen tillet mottakarane hertugparet å fornya nokre av møblane sine. Louise hadde vore med på å utarbeide krigserklæringa, den kristne Truchseß von Wetzhausen zu Bettenburg var ven av hertugparet og gudfar til Charlottes son Edvard. Mange tilskodarar hadde kome for å sjå den bayerske kronprinsessa, då ho tok imot gjestane hans, prøvde Truchseß å føre den lågare rangerte Charlotte først inn på slottet hans, men ho nekta og viste til dottera si. Truchseß svara: "Din høghet vil tilgje meg, men så lenge dette slottet har stått her, tok Therese baronane den andre armen, og dei tre gjekk saman gjennom porten. Hertuginna gav om lag halvparten av inntekta si til dei fattige, pensjonistane.<br/><br/>1617.<br/>Karl av Hessen-Kassel<br/>–<br/>Prins Karl av Hessen-Kassel var eit kadettmedlem av huset Hessen-Kassel og ein dansk generalfeltmarskalk. Han budde det meste av livet i Danmark og mora var dotter av kong Georg II av Storbritannia og Caroline av Ansbach og syster av dronning Louise av Danmark. Faren, den framtidige landgreven, forlét familien i 1747, i 1755 avslutta han formelt ekteskapet med Maria. Bestefaren, Vilhelm VIII, landgreve av Hessen, gav grevskapet Hanau og inntektene til Maria, den unge prinsen Karl og dei to brørne hans, Vilhelm og Fredrik, vart oppfostra av mora og vart fostra av protestantiske slektningar sidan 1747. I 1756 flytta Maria til Danmark for å ta seg av dei mindreårige borna til søstera, dronning Louise av Danmark, og tok med seg sønene sine som var oppvaksen ved hoffet på Christiansborg slott i København. Dei hessiske fyrstane vart seinare verande i Danmark, og vart viktige herskarar. Berre den eldste broren Vilhelm kom attende til Hessen i 1785 då han vart landgreve. Karl byrja ein karriere i Danmark. I 1758 vart han utnemnd til oberst, i ein alder av 20 generalmajor, også i 1766 vart han utnemnd til generalguvernør i Noreg, ei stilling han hadde til 1768, men som stort sett vart verande titulær, sidan han aldri drog til Noreg i denne perioden. I 1763 gifta den eldre broren Vilhelm seg med den første fetteren deira, Karl følgde etter den 30. august 1766 på Christiansborg slott — kona hans var Louise av Danmark, og Karl blei dermed svoger til fetteren sin, kong Christian VII. Ekteskapet fann stad trass i råd som vart gjevne mot det, på grunn av skuldingar om utskeiingar av prins Karl. Kort tid etter fall Karl i unåde ved hoffet, og tidleg i 1767 fekk han og dei sitt første barn, Marie Sophie, der i 1767 og så det andre barnet deira, Vilhelm, i 1769. I 1768 kjøpte Karl eigedomen og landsbyen Offenbach-Rumpenheim frå familien Edelsheim, og i 1771 fekk han herregården utvida til ei borg og fyrstesete og mora Maria budde i palasset til ho døydde i 1772. I 1781 selde Karl slottet Rumpenheim til den yngre broren sin, Karl busette seg på Gottorp slott i Schleswig med familien. Dei fekk sitt tredje barn Fredrik der i 1771, i 1770 gav kong Christian VII syster si godset Tegelhof i Güby mellom byen Schleswig og Eckernförde. Frå 1772 til 1776 fekk Karl bygd ein sommarresidens på staden som han gav namnet Louisenlund til ære for kona si. I september 1772 vart Karl utnemnd til øvstkommanderande for den norske hæren og han og Louise flytta til Christiana. Oppdraget var ein konsekvens av statskuppet til kong Gustav III av Sverige den 19. august 1772, medan prinsesse Louise i Noreg fødde sitt fjerde barn Juliane i 1773<br/><br/>18.<br/>Louise Caroline av Hessen-Kassel<br/>–<br/>Louise Caroline av Hessen-Kassel vart fødd i Gottorp i Hertugdømet Schleswig som son av landgreve Karl av Hessen-Kassel og prinsesse Louise av Danmark.<br/>–<br/>Prinsesse Louise Caroline<br/><br/>19.<br/>Fredrik av Hessen-Kassel<br/>–<br/>Landgreve Fredrik<br/><br/>20.<br/>Prins Vilhelm av Hessen Prins Vilhelm av Hessen<br/>–<br/>Vilhelm av Hessen-Kassel<br/><br/>212223.<br/>Prinsesse Louise24.<br/>Sophia Fredrika av Mecklenburg-Schwerin<br/>–<br/>Sophia Frederica av Me252627 mors28.<br/>Albert Azzo II, markgreve av Milano<br/>–<br/>Alberto Azzo II, markgreve av Milano og Liguria, greve av Gavello og Padova, Rovigo, Lunigiana, Monselice og Montagnana, aka Albertezzo II, var ein mektig adelsmann i Det tysk-romerske riket. Han vert rekna som grunnleggjaren av Casa dEste, etter å ha vore overhovud for den første familien som var herre over Este, var Alberto Azzo II den einaste sonen til Albert Azzo I, markgreve av Milano. Han arva embeta til far sin rundt 1020, og auka stadig eigedomane sine i Nord-Italia. I 1069–1070 prøvde han å kjøpe Maine for sonen Hugh, fordi kona hans, Garsende, var medarving av dei tidlegare grevane av Maine. Hugo vart erklært greve, men han kunne ikkje få overtaket mot Robert, hertugen av Normandie, i Investiture-striden mellom Henrik IV av Det tysk-romerske riket og pave Gregor VII. Azzo prøvde å mekle, men seinare slutta han seg til paven. Rundt 1073 bygde han ei borg ved Este residensen sin, som Huset Este, før byggeprosjektet hans, Este var lite meir enn ein landsby. Sonen hans Welf flytta først til Kärnten og så til Bayern, noko som gav opphav til ein av dei viktigaste familiane i europeisk historie. Ein annan son, Fulko I av Milano, gjorde den første dokumenterte bruken av tittelen marki dEste. Azzo II gifta seg med Kunigunde, dotter av Welf II, greve av Altdorf og dei fekk eitt kjend barn, Welf hertug av Bayern frå 1070 til 1077 og frå 1096 til han døydde som var det første medlemmet av Welf-greina av huset Este. Det andre ekteskapet hans var med Garsende, dottera til Herbert I, greve av Maine og dei hadde følgjande kjende søner, Fulco I, markgreve av Milano, stamfar til den italienske greina av Huset Este Hugo V, greve av Maine, hadde ingen etterkomarar. Nokre kjelder seier at han òg gifta seg med Vitalia Orseolo, dotter av Peter Orseolo og han hadde eit utanomekteskapleg forhold med Matilda, syster av Vilhelm, biskop av Padova, som han hadde ei dotter med som heitte Adelasia som gifta seg med Guglielmo Adelardi.

Han var det første medlemmet av Welf-avdelinga av huset Este, i slektsgranskinga til eldstehuset Welf er han rekna som Welf IV. Welf var son av Azzo II av Este og kona Kunigunde av Altdorf, då Welfs moronkel, Welf, hertug av Kärnten, døydde barnlaus, Welf arva eigedommen sin. Welf gifta seg med Ethelinde av Northeim, dottera til Otto II, hertug av Bayern, då svigerfaren, hertug Otto, hadde vorte ein fiende av kong Henrik IV og gav opp hertugdømet sitt. I samsvar med Henrik sine kommandoar avviste han og skilde seg frå hertuginna si, Ethelinde og denne hendinga fann stad ved Goslar i 1070, då statane i Bayern i det stille underkastet seg den nyoppretta hertugen, som var representant for ein av dei eldste familiane i provinsen. Paven og keisaren vart overflatisk forsona i 1076, men året etter vart dei igjen involverte i aktive fiendskapar. Henrik, som følgje av fleire opprør, erklærte Welf avsett i det nyoppretta hertugdømet sitt. Med støtte frå dei trufaste bayerarane, og med hjelp frå faren i Italia, klarte Welf å halde på plassen sin, men Gregor døydde i 1085 og etterkomarane hans tok ein mindre intensiv del i Tyskland. I 1070 gifta Welf seg med Judith av Flandern, dotter av Balduin IV, greve av Flandern, og ei enkje etter Tostig Godwinson, jarl av Northumbria. I 1089 gifta Welfs son Welf seg med Matilda av Toscana, og styrkte dermed tilhøva til paven, men etter at den yngre Welf skilde seg frå Matilda i 1095 gjorde Welf opp med kong Henrik IV og vart stadfesta i stillinga si som hertug av Bayern. Etter at faren Azzo døydde i 1097, prøvde Welf å kjøpe eigedomane til far sin sør for Alpane, og i 1099 slo Welf seg saman med Vilhelm IX av Aquitaine, Hugo av Vermandois og Ida av Austerrike. Den største suksessen hans var å hindre eit samanstøt mellom andre krossfararar, som hadde plyndra bysantinske område på veg til Konstantinopel, Welf sjølv unngjekk fiaskoen, men døydde på veg tilbake i Pafos på Kypros i 1101 og vart gravlagd i Weingarten-klosteret.

Henrik var son av hertug Welf I av Bayern frå ekteskapet hans med Judith. Som ung administrerte han familiane Este eigedom sør for Alpane, gjennom ekteskapet sitt med Wulfhilde, dotter av hertug Magnus av Sachsen, om lag 1095, fekk han ein del av Billung-eigedomane rundt Lüneburg. Han ønskte å etterfølgja svigerfaren som saksisk hertug då Magnus døydde utan arvingar i 1106. Hertug Henrik opprettheldt likevel nære relasjonar med det herskande Saliske dynastiet, og i 1116 slo han seg saman med keisar Henrik V i det andre italienske felttoget for å erobra landområda til den seine markgrevinna Matilda av Toscana. Han etterfølgde den eldre broren sin Welf II som bayersk hertug, då denne døydde barnlaus i 1120, var Henrik òg med på å få til Wormskonkordatet i 1122, som gjorde slutt på den langvarige investiturstriden mellom paven og keisaren. Ekteskapet vart avslutta i mai 1127, og skilnaden mellom Welf- og Hohenstaufen-dynastia varte fram til 1200-talet, men etter at Lothar vann valet la han ned eit keisarleg forbod mot Fredrik II.

This way he gets to have all the goodies that weren't given out!<br/><br/>6<br/>comments:<br/><br/>It was Halloween here last night and we had ...... no kids at all at our door.<br/><br/>Halloween is not really celebrated here. The shopkeepers try to promote it by advertising and selling various Halloween gear but it just doesn't catch on at all. In fact there is a resistance to it by many.<br/><br/>have a fun halloween! it's 6:30 right now and we haven't had any trick or treaters yet. i've got "candy detail" tonight. my husband is taking tc around the neighborhood tonight.<br/><br/>we're giving out mini chocolate bars and the costco candy mix (lollipops, sweet tarts, tootsie rolls and such). we have some duddy bubble gum for the rude kids who don't say trick or treat, please or thank you (normallhy the older teenagers). i'm so mean. if they're not nice to me, then they get a one tiny crappy piece of candy. let's hope they don't egg our house later that night. ha ha | Kva gjev alle triksa eller godbitane sine i kveld?

| Follow Us<br/><br/>ARE YOU AN<br/><br/>INSIDER<br/><br/>Craving Sugar? Here's What Your Body Is Trying to Tell You<br/><br/>by<br/>Byrdie<br/><br/>PHOTO:<br/><br/>Jacquemus<br/><br/>Weight gain from out-of-control cravings aside, it can be frustrating to have a constant hankering for something unhealthy and not know why. The good news is that there's usually a reason underlying that burning desire to house a bag of potato chips, or the feeling that you might actually die if you don't get a pickle rightthisinstant (even though you're not pregnant). If you're having visions of Milky Way bars, for example, it could mean that you're missing a very specific nutrient in your diet. (Yup—it's more complicated than said chocolate bar being so darn delicious.)<br/><br/>We talked to Los Angeles–based dietitian Shira Lenchewski, M.S., R.D., to get the skinny on some common food cravings, as well as what you can do to satiate the hunger without going overboard. Keep scrolling for some seriously good information!<br/><br/>If you're craving chocolate<br/><br/>It means: You could be lacking magnesium in your diet, says Lenchewski. "Magnesium is an essential mineral involved in energy production, glucose metabolism, and muscle function. This is especially true for those hitting the gym hard," she explains. Additionally, magnesium levels lower during the pre-menstrual weeks of your period, which explains why PMS so often comes with chocolate cravings.<br/><br/>Instead, reach for high-quality, low-sugar dark chocolate, which is naturally high in magnesium. "I recommend sticking to 75 per cent cocoa or higher, and pairing it with another magnesium-rich source like sunflower seeds," says Lenchewski. She suggests the chocolate brand Hu, a small-batch food company that focuses on high-quality ingredients produced locally. "It's a little pricey, but all the more reason to keep portions in check," she says. "It's my personal favourite." We're also big fans of superfood-packed Zenbunni.<br/><br/>If you're craving candy<br/><br/>It means: "Craving pure sugar is a good indication that you're running low on energy," says Lenchewski. "Think about it. What is the one thing you're itching for after a terrible night's sleep or at around 4 p.m. during a stressful workday? The answer is usually sugar because it's used as instant fuel for our body's cells."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for apples with nut butter. "If you're raiding your co-workers' candy stash, I recommend a more slow-burn carbohydrate with a source of fat or protein," says Lenchewski. "Unlike simple sugar, this will fuel your cells while avoiding the post-sugar crash. Two options that make for great pick-me-ups the next time you're craving candy: a sliced apple with your choice of nut butter, or berries with 2% unsweetened Greek yoghurt." We like quashing a sweet tooth with these addictive coconut chips, too—they're filling, free of any added sugar, and just so good.<br/><br/>If you're craving salt<br/><br/>It means: "If nothing but the saltiest pickle will do, you may not be drinking enough H2O," says Lenchewski. "Salt helps the body hold on to water, so we crave it when we're in need of fluids."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for water. "Stay hydrated, especially as we approach the summer months," she says. The next time a craving hits, try quenching it (literally) with a few refreshing glasses and you might find the urgency to sodium binge disappears. "If plain water bores you, try adding in mint, lemon, or frozen fruit to mix it up," says Lenchewski. And if that still doesn't do the trick, there's a healthier alternative to bagged chips or fries. "If you're really just craving salt after all, toasted seaweed is a great low-calorie option," she says.<br/><br/>If you're craving starchy carbs like pasta<br/><br/>It means: "Because high-carb foods boost the feel-good hormone serotonin, starch cravings can be a sign you're in need of a mood booster," says Lenchewski.<br/><br/>Instead, reach for a bath! "Bust out the Epsom salts, because it's time for some serious R+R," says Lenchewski. "Trust me. Indulging in a starch free-for-all feels really good in the moment, but it will likely bum you out more the next day." (As anyone who has ever over-indulged a pizza or pasta craving knows.) So the next time you want to dive head first into a bowl of carbs, draw a bath, light a candle, and treat yourself without any regret or dense calories.<br/><br/>If you're craving ice cream<br/><br/>5 / 6<br/><br/>It means: "Your body may be telling you it's in need of some healthy fat."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for coconut ice cream. "I'm a realist, so if you're craving ice cream, I'm not going to recommend a handful of walnuts, which are, of course, full of healthy fat," says Lenchewski. "For ice cream emergencies, I recommend lower-in-sugar coconut ice-creams like Coconut Bliss or Kippy's three-ingredient ice cream in Los Angeles." We can vouch for the fact that coconut ice cream tastes incredible and just like the real thing.<br/><br/>If you're craving a burger<br/><br/>It means: You need iron. "If you can't stop thinking about red meat, there's a chance your body is craving iron, b12 and folic acid," says Lenchewski. "This is especially true during or around that time of the month."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for a healthier burger. "I'm a proponent of grass fed, antibiotic and hormone-free red meat once a week," says Lenchewski. "Try experimenting with an open-faced bison burger—which, cut for cut, is leaner and has more iron than beef." Don't eat meat? Try to incorporate some kind of plant-based iron supplement into your routine, like spirulina. | Følg oss på sosiale medier<br/><br/>Er du ein<br/><br/>INNVENDING<br/><br/>Lyst på sukker? Dette er det kroppen din prøver å fortelje deg<br/><br/>etter<br/>Byrdie<br/><br/>FOTO:<br/><br/>Jacquemus<br/><br/>Vektøkning frå ukontrollerte lyster til sides, det kan vere frustrerande å ha ein konstant lengsel etter noko usunn og ikkje vite kvifor. Den gode nyheita er at det vanlegvis ligg ein grunn bak det brennande ønsket om å huse ein pose potetgull, eller kjensla av at ein faktisk kan døy om ein ikkje får ein sylteagurk med det same (sjølv om ein ikkje er gravid). Viss du til dømes ser Mjølkevegstavar, kan det bety at du manglar eit særs spesifikt næringsstoff i kosten din. (Ja, det er meir komplisert enn at sjokoladestaven er så himla deilig.)<br/><br/>Me snakka med den Los Angeles-baserte diettisten Shira Lenchewski, M.S., R.D., for å få mager på nokre vanlege matbehov, i tillegg til kva du kan gjere for å mette sulten utan å gå over bord. Hald fram med å bla for å få noko alvorleg god informasjon!<br/><br/>Dersom du lengtar etter sjokolade<br/><br/>Det tyder: Du kan mangla magnesium i kosten, seier Lenchewski. "Magnesium er eit essensielt mineral som er involvert i energiproduksjon, glukosemetabolisme og muskelfunksjon. Dette gjeld særleg dei som trenjer hardt," forklarar ho. I tillegg blir magnesiumnivået lågare i dei premenstruelle vekene i perioden, noko som forklarer kvifor PMS så ofte kjem med sjokoladetrang.<br/><br/>«Eg tilrår å halde meg til 75 prosent kakao eller meir, og pare det med ei anna magnesiumrik kjelde som solsikkefrø», seier Lenchewski. Ho føreslår sjokolademerket Hu, eit lite matselskap som fokuserer på lokale råvarer av høg kvalitet. "Det er litt dyrt, men deisto større grunn til å halde porsjonane i sjakk", seier ho. "Det er min personlege favoritt." Vi er òg store tilhengjarar av supermatpakka Zenbunni.<br/><br/>Dersom du lengtar etter godteri<br/><br/>Det tyder: "Å krevja reint sukker er ein god indikasjon på at du har lite energi," seier Lenchewski. "Tenk på det. Kva er det eine du klør etter etter ein grufull nattesøvn eller rundt klokka fire på ein stressande arbeidsdag? Svaret er vanlegvis sukker fordi det vert nytta som instant drivstoff for kroppens celler.»<br/><br/>«Om du plyndrer kollegene dine for godteri, anbefaler eg eit meir saktebrennande karbohydrat med ei kjelde av feitt eller protein», seier Lenchewski. «I motsetnad til enkelt sukker, vil dette drivstoffa cellene dine, samtidig som du unngår post-sukkerkrasjet. To val som gjer at du får gode pick-me-ups neste gong du cravar godteri: eit skiva eple med ditt val av nøttesmør, eller bær med 2% usøta gresk yoghurt.» Vi liker å kvase ei søt tann med desse vanedannende kokosnøttchipsa òg -- dei fyller, fri for tilsett sukker, og berre så godt.<br/><br/>Dersom du traktar etter salt<br/><br/>Det tyder: «Om ikkje noko anna enn den saltaste sylteagurken vil gjere det, kan det vere at du ikkje drikk nok H2O», seier Lenchewski. «Salt hjelper kroppen til å halde på vatnet, så me treng det når me treng væske.»<br/><br/>"Hold deg hydrert, spesielt når vi nærmar oss sommarmånadene," seier ho. Neste gong ein craving treffer, prøv å slokke det (bokstaveleg talt) med eit par oppfriskande briller, og du kan finne at det haster med natrium binge forsvinn. "Viss du kjeder deg med reint vatn, prøv å tilsette mynte, sitron eller frossen frukt for å blande det saman", seier Lenchewski. Og om det framleis ikkje gjer trikset, er det eit sunnare alternativ til posjerte chips eller pommes frites. "Viss du verkeleg berre craving salt tross alt, er rista tang eit flott kalorifattig alternativ," seier ho.<br/><br/>Om du cravar etter stivelseshaldige karbohydrat som pasta<br/><br/>Det tyder: «Fordi karbohydratrik mat aukar feel-good-hormonet serotonin, kan stivelseslyst vera eit teikn på at du treng ein stemningsboostar», seier Lenchewski.<br/><br/>«Blås ut Epsom-salta, for det er på tide med noko alvorleg R+R», seier Lenchewski. «Stol på meg. Det kjennes veldig godt i augneblinken å sluke ein stivelse som er gratis for alle, men det vil truleg få deg ut meir neste dag.» (Som alle som nokon gong har overteke ein pizza eller pasta craving veit.) Så neste gong du vil dykke hovudet først ned i ein bolle med karbohydrat, teikne eit bad, tenne eit stearinlys, og behandle deg sjølv utan å angre eller tette kaloriar.<br/><br/>Om du lengtar etter iskrem<br/><br/>5 / 6<br/><br/>Det tyder: «Kroppen din kan fortelje deg at han har behov for noko sunt feitt.»<br/><br/>«Eg er realist, så viss du cravar iskrem, skal eg ikkje anbefale ein handfull valnøtter, som sjølvsagt er fulle av sunt feitt», seier Lenchewski. "For iskrem-nødsituasjonar, anbefaler eg kokos-is med lågare sukker som Coconut Bliss eller Kippy's tre-ingrediens iskrem i Los Angeles." Vi kan gå god for at kokos-is smaker utruleg og akkurat som det verkelege.<br/><br/>Om du lengtar etter ein burger<br/><br/>Det tyder: Du treng jern. «Dersom du ikkje kan slutte å tenkje på raudt kjøt, er det ein sjanse for at kroppen din har lyst på jern, b12 og folsyre», seier Lenchewski. «Dette gjeld særleg i eller rundt den tida på månaden.»<br/><br/>«Eg er ein forkjempar for grasmat, antibiotika og hormonfritt raudt kjøt ein gong i veka», seier Lenchewski. «Prøv å eksperimentere med ein open-faced bison burger—som, kutt for kutt, er slankere og har meir jern enn biff.» Prøv å leggje til eit eller anna plantebasert jerntilskudd i rutinen, som spirulina. |

Spoiler alert: This brain teaser is entirely solvable. Scroll down to read the puzzle, and to get the answer. Good luck!<br/><br/>Here's The Puzzle<br/><br/>Alice and Bob are each told a number, but neither knows the other's number. Both of the numbers are positive and consecutive. In the room with Alice and Bob, there is a clock that dings every minute. Someone can guess the other's number only at the ding of that clock, but they can also remain silent. If someone correctly guesses the other's number on the first try, both people $1 million.<br/><br/>There is a way to win without any form of communication between Alice and Bob, and, duh, without cheating. It's completely logical and can guarantee a win on the first try. How can they do it? Watch the video below to find out.<br/><br/>The Seemingly Impossible Guess The Number Puzzle<br/><br/>Share the knowledge!<br/><br/>Here's The Answer<br/><br/>Suppose Alice is told the number N. She hears the clock ding N-1 times, so she knows that Bob was told N+1. Therefore, on the next ding, she can correctly guess Bob's secret number. If we're dealing with small numbers, however, it can be played differently. If Alice was told 1, she knows Bob was told 2 because 0 is not a positive (or negative) number.

Lykke til!<br/><br/>Her er puslespelet<br/><br/>Alice og Bob får kvar si tale, men ingen av dei veit talet til den andre. Begge tala er positive og følgjer etter kvarandre. I rommet med Alice og Bob er det ei klokke som dinglar kvart minutt. Nokon kan berre gjetta nummeret til den andre på den klokka, men dei kan òg vera stille. Viss nokon gjettar nummeret til den andre på første forsøk, vil begge personane få $ 1 million.<br/><br/>Det er ein måte å vinna på utan nokon form for kommunikasjon mellom Alice og Bob, og, duh, utan å juksa.

Ho høyrer klokka dinga N-1 gonger, slik at ho veit at Bob vart fortalt N+1. Derfor kan ho på neste dinga gjetta det hemmelege nummeret til Bob. Viss me har å gjere med små tal, kan det likevel spelast annleis. Viss Alice fekk 1, veit ho at Bob fekk 2, fordi 0 ikkje er eit positivt (eller negativt) tal.

| Web Services, Vendors And Cyber Laws!<br/><br/>Updated On:April 21, 2014Bilal Ahmad<br/><br/>Computerization of this world changed human performance scenario to a great extent and that too beyond measurement. For instance, Now you can send vital information all across the globe with a single mouse click, thanks to internet connectivity. Sadly, it is this wide connectivity and popularity among people, internet has also increased chances for computer crimes. Internet crimes or computer crimes are widely known as 'Cyber Crimes'.<br/><br/>'Cyber Laws' is something new in the judiciary system but has gained a lot of attention lately. The term cyber crime is something very synonymous with conventional crime, the only difference being medium of execution. There are majorly two types of cyber crimes, the first one is in which computers are the main targets and these include cases of data damage, malicious code and even criminal data access. The second one is in which computer is only a tool using which conventional crimes are committed for eg cyber terrorism, spamming, cyber stalking and many more.<br/><br/>This is where a website consultant or a vendor comes into scene. Although not aware of all the cyber laws present till date, a website vendor can advise you on some of the most vital cyber laws while creating your site.<br/><br/>This may include common knowledge of copy rights or even protecting the content of your own website. Explaining you all the rights you posses as a website owner is also one the tasks a website vendor may do while developing your website. A vendor can also assist you by offering you information on different cyber laws to protect data. Besides all of this, a vendor can also offer you information on any new cyber law that you may not be aware of till know. Cyber laws may vary from nation to nation, one recent example can be of the cookie law released in the United Kingdom, which prevents the website from saving any user browsing data. As per the Cookie Law, websites in the United Kingdom cannot save cookie files without informational consent from the surfer.<br/><br/>It is after the implementation of such law, websites now have a pop-up window, which seeks the consent of the visitor for saving cookies files. Such files are used by websites to analyze the browsing pattern of visitors based on which advertisements are then posted on a user window. With hacking not anymore a new thing for all of us, do you think such rules and regulations can prevent online forgery or cyber crime? Technology has developed at a rapid rate but still people do not prefer shopping online due to fear of personal or bank account details getting hacked. With the rise of cyber crime, need of stringent cyber laws have also increased to curb the same and to promote a risk free shopping experience.<br/><br/>Classes of Cyber Crimes<br/><br/>Over the years there have been three major classes of cyber crimes:<br/><br/>Unauthorized access of computer system cases, which involves hacking or stealing usernames and passwords to gain access over personal information of the respective user. These kind of backdoor access are organized with the help of Trojan Horse. Releasing malicious programs like Trojan House, worms or computer viruses etc. The last class includes cyber stalking a user or online harassment .<br/><br/>Direct implications of Cyber crimes<br/><br/>Decrease in sales<br/><br/>Decrease in staff output due to network delays<br/><br/>Loss of personalized information like research work<br/><br/>Disruption in communication process<br/><br/>Indirect implications of Cyber crimes<br/><br/>Credibility issue in our financial system<br/><br/>Brand image is tarnished in the market<br/><br/>Cyber crimes affect business to business relationship in the market<br/><br/>Sense of trust in state policies and government agencies is lost<br/><br/>Preventing Cyber Crime<br/><br/>As netizens there are certain precautions that we should consider for a safe and secure online experience. Here are some of them:<br/><br/>First thing to do will be to keep personal information to your self and avoid sharing the same online.<br/><br/>Avoid sharing any photographs with online chat friends or strangers.<br/><br/>Installing latest version of anti-virus on your system can offer you a good line of defense against internet threats like viruses and malware.<br/><br/>Keeping back up of your valuable data is a good option to avoid problems like virus contamination.<br/><br/>Avoid sending credit card information to sites that are unsecured and don't have any valid certificate.<br/><br/>Installing safety programme that offers you control over site cookies and saves you from being tracked by websites.<br/><br/>Putting host-based intrusions detection devices on servers will help you keep track of irregularities on your website traffic.<br/><br/>Use of firewall is advised.<br/><br/>Why Cyber attacks are so popular?<br/><br/>Cheaper than traditional cheating methods<br/><br/>Tracking cyber crimes are not easy<br/><br/>Exact locations cannot be tracked easily<br/><br/>Absence of physical barrier in the internet world<br/><br/>Cyber crimes affect large number of people<br/><br/>Conclusion<br/><br/>The fact that human mind has unfathomable power is undeniable, which is why internet crimes are increasing at a tremendous rate. Even history has witnessed some of the greatest internet security gone kaput by the hands of hackers, who have easily got away too. The only way to curb such crime is to remain aware of the cyber laws that we have today, that can either be through internet or through website/IT vendors. Information Technology Act has to be balanced in such a way that it proves too stringent for people who are involved in cyber crimes and at the same time it should never hamper the growth of Internet industry.<br/><br/>Author Bio:– Maneet Puri at present is heading a quality web design firm located at New Delhi, India. With unmatchable expertise in technical domain, he has been offering professional web consultation services to his clients located all round the globe. He is also an avid writer and some of his commended work have been published on renowned websites | Netttenester, leverandørar og nettlover!<br/><br/>Oppdatert den:april 21, 2014Bilal Ahmad<br/><br/>Databehandling av denne verda endra menneskeleg yteevne i stor grad, og det òg utover måling. No kan du til dømes sende viktig informasjon over heile verda med eit enkelt museklikk, takk til internett-tilkopling. Dessverre er det denne breie tilkoplinga og populariteten blant folk, internett har òg auka sjansane for datakriminalitet. Internettkriminalitet eller datakriminalitet er allment kjend som 'cyberkriminalitet'.<br/><br/>'Cyber Laws' er noko nytt i rettsvesenet, men har fått mykje merksemd i det siste. Begrepet cyberkriminalitet er noko svært synonymt med konvensjonell kriminalitet, den einaste skilnaden er medium for avretting. Det finst hovudsakleg to typar cyberkriminalitet, den første er der datamaskiner er hovudmål og desse inkluderer tilfelle av dataskade, ondsinnet kode og til og med kriminell datatilgang. Den andre er der datamaskina berre er eit verkty som vert brukt til å begå konvensjonelle brotsverk for t.d. nettterrorisme, spamming, nettstalking og mange fleire.<br/><br/>Det er her ein nettkonsulent eller ein nettleverandør kjem inn. Sjølv om du ikkje er klar over alle nettlovane som finst til dags dato, kan ein nettleverandør gje deg råd om nokre av dei viktigaste nettlovane når du opprettar nettsida di.<br/><br/>Dette kan innehalde felles kjennskap til kopieringsrettar eller til og med vern av innhaldet på din eigen nettstad. Å forklara deg alle rettane du har som nettstadseigar er òg ei av oppgåvene ein nettstadsleverandør kan gjere når du utviklar nettsida di. Ein leverandør kan òg hjelpe deg ved å tilby deg informasjon om ulike cyberlover for å verne data. I tillegg til alt dette kan ein leverandør også tilby deg informasjon om eventuelle nye cyberlover som du kanskje ikkje er klar over før du kjenner til dei. Cyberlover kan variere frå land til land, eit nyare døme kan vere av informasjonskapsellova som er utgjeven i Storbritannia, som hindrar nettstaden i å lagre data om brukarnettlesing. Ifølgje cookie-lova kan ikkje nettsider i Storbritannia lagre cookie-filer utan informasjonssamtykke frå nettlesaren.<br/><br/>Det er etter innføringa av slik lov at nettstader no har eit sprettoppvindauge, som ber om samtykke frå den vitjande til å lagre informasjonskapslar. Slike filer blir brukt av nettsider for å analysere nettlesingsmønsteret til besøkande basert på kva for annonsar som så blir lagt ut i eit brukarvindauge. Med hacking ikkje lenger noko nytt for oss alle, trur du slike reglar og reguleringar kan hindre nettforfalskning eller nettkriminalitet? Teknologien har utvikla seg raskt, men likevel føretrekkjer ikkje folk å handla på nettet på grunn av frykt for at personlege eller bankkontodetaljar skal bli hacka. Etter kvart som nettkriminaliteten aukar, har òg behovet for strenge nettlovar auka for å dempe dette og for å fremje ei risikofri handleoppleving.<br/><br/>Klassar av nettkriminalitet<br/><br/>Gjennom åra har det vore tre store klassar av nettkriminalitet:<br/><br/>Uautorisert tilgang til datasystemsaker, som involverer hacking eller tyveri av brukarnamn og passord for å få tilgang til personopplysningar om den respektive brukaren. Denne typen bakdørstilgang er organisert ved hjelp av Trojan Horse. Slepp ut skadelege program som Trojan House, ormar eller datavirus osb. Den siste klassen omfattar cyber-stalking av ein brukar eller trakassering på nettet .<br/><br/>Direkte implikasjonar av cyberkriminalitet<br/><br/>Nedgang i salet<br/><br/>Redusert arbeidsmengde på grunn av nettverksforseinkingar<br/><br/>Tap av personleg informasjon som forskingsarbeid<br/><br/>Forstyrring i kommunikasjonsprosessen<br/><br/>Indirekte konsekvensar av nettkriminalitet<br/><br/>Troverdigheitsproblem i finanssystemet vårt<br/><br/>Merkevarebiletet er plettfritt på marknaden<br/><br/>Cyberkriminalitet påverkar forretningssamanhengen i marknaden<br/><br/>Kjensla av tillit til statspolitikk og statlege verksemder går tapt<br/><br/>Forhindra nettkriminalitet<br/><br/>Som nettbrukar er det visse forholdsregelar som vi bør vurdere for å få ei trygg og sikker oppleving på nettet. Her er nokre av dei:<br/><br/>Det første du må gjere er å halde personopplysningane for deg sjølv og unngå å dele dei på nettet.<br/><br/>Unngå å dele bilete med nettpratvenner eller fremmede.<br/><br/>Installering av den siste versjonen av antivirus på systemet ditt kan gje deg ei god forsvarslinje mot Internett-truslar som virus og skadevare.<br/><br/>Å ta vare på dei verdifulle dataa dine er eit godt alternativ for å unngå problem som virussmitte.<br/><br/>Unngå å senda kredittkortinformasjon til nettstader som ikkje er sikra og ikkje har eit gyldig sertifikat.<br/><br/>Installere tryggleiksprogram som gir deg kontroll over informasjonskapslar på nettstaden og som reddar deg frå å bli spora av nettstadar.<br/><br/>Å setja vertsbaserte inntrengingsdeteksjonsanordningar på tenarar vil hjelpa deg å halda oversikt over uregelmessigheiter i trafikken på nettstaden din.<br/><br/>Bruk av brannmur er tilrådd.<br/><br/>Kvifor er nettangrep så populære?<br/><br/>Billigere enn tradisjonelle juksemetodar<br/><br/>Det er ikkje lett å spore nettkriminalitet<br/><br/>Kan ikkje spora nøyaktige stader<br/><br/>Fråvær av fysiske barrierer i internettverda<br/><br/>Cyberkriminalitet påverkar mange menneske<br/><br/>Konklusjon<br/><br/>At menneskesinnet har ufatteleg makt er ubestrideleg, noko som er grunnen til at internettkriminaliteten aukar enormt. Sjølv historia har vore vitne til noko av den største Internett-tryggleiken som er blitt kaputt av hackarar, som òg lett har kome seg unna. Den einaste måten å dempe slik kriminalitet på er å halde seg oppdatert på dei nettlovane vi har i dag, som anten kan vere via internett eller gjennom nettstad/IT-leverandørar. Lova om informasjonsteknologi må balanseres på ein slik måte at det viser seg å vere for stringent for folk som er involvert i nettkriminalitet, og samtidig at det aldri skal hemme veksten i internettindustrien.<br/><br/>Forfatter Bio:– Maneet Puri er for tida leiar for eit kvalitetswebdesignfirma som ligg i New Delhi i India.
