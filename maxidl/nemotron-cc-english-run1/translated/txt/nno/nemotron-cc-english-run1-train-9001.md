| UNDERSTANDING SELF-EXECUTING TREATIES VIA STATE PRACTICE<br/><br/>Updated: Feb 2<br/><br/>Introduction:<br/><br/>Consider this paradox, when a country ratifies a treaty, it is said to have consented to accept the treaty in its entirety (reservations and declarations being exceptions); but in some cases, the countries go ahead and refuse to adhere to its provisions. For example, Article VI, Clause 2 of the American Constitution has the provisions that "all treaties … shall be the supreme Law of the Land." Although it is evident that treaties on their own do not have the same effect as federal laws. In truth, they only become operational once these provisions come into force as Federal law with Senate and Presidential approval. Although this is the practice, it is a generally accepted principle in international law that certain treaties have a binding effect on countries. The treaty must fulfil the requirement of being a self-executing treaty to affect the country without any corresponding domestic legislature directly.<br/><br/>This raises the question as to which treaty will qualify as "self-executing" and which will not?<br/><br/>Whether a treaty is a self-executing treaty or not is decided by national judges on a case-to-case basis (Buergenthal, 1992). In order to understand this, the paper will first look at the two types of theories followed by countries on the nature of treaties applying to domestic law. These two theories are monism and dualism. They basically view the framework of domestic and international law as a single hierarchy and two separate hierarchies, respectively (Wildhaber, 1971). Countries following monism believe that certain treaties immediately are binding and immediately have an effect on the country. Once the treaty has been ratified, it can be invoked in national courts and is considered to be a part of the law of the country. Countries following dualism believe that a treaty does not affect domestic law until it has been reinforced by a legislature passed in the parliament. An example of dualism is how the European Convention on Human Rights became operational in the United Kingdom after passing the Human Rights Act 1998 in their parliament (Laws, 2000).<br/><br/>International law is diverse, and so are the types of procedures different countries follow for the acceptance of treaties. Some constitutions' themselves mention the procedures for the ratification of a treaty. Some countries even have different treatment given to international treaty law and customary international law. Certain international organizations like the European Union often affect the domestic law of its member states. The member states of the European Union have to give effect to certain forms of community legislature. Although, it has an essential difference from self-executing treaties. The difference is that it is not for national judges to decide whether the provisions are self-executing or not, but rather for the European Court of Justice to interpret under its constitutive treaties. Other forms of international law formed via resolutions or such might not have the same effect for these states. Nevertheless, they might consider them as forms of "soft law" and look into them to interpret the intent of the law. Sometimes, proclamations made by the judicial organs of international organizations such as the Inter-American Court of Human Rights affect their member states. Although these proclamations are not binding on the member states, the national judges seem to refer to these for authoritative interpretation.<br/><br/>Therefore, a case-to-case approach must be taken while analyzing the procedures and precedents set in different countries. To examine the concept of self-executing treaties, this paper will compare the precedents set by different jurisdictions. If the reader wishes to conduct a similar analysis, they can do so by looking into the different national yearbooks on international law. Mostly, these yearbooks will have a section devoted to the relationship between international and national law.<br/><br/>International Jurisprudence:<br/><br/>The most significant issue that comes up for national courts is whether the treaty is self-executing? If the treaty can be applied without any additional domestic legislature having passed to reinforce it. This question came up in the case of Czesław S v State Treasury and Minister of the State Treasury, wherein the Polish Constitutional Court held that since the treaty provisions referred to domestic measures to be taken, the treaty was not self-executing in nature (Bug river claims, Czesław S v State Treasury and Minister of the State Treasury, 2003). Essentially, when the treaty refers to domestic measures to be taken, it does not in itself create new obligations. It instead reinforces the treaty's intent for the domestic legal process to take measures for the same. A similar issue was raised in the Sosa case in the United States of America. In this case, the court considered whether the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights was a self-executing treaty. The American Supreme Court has also declared that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is not a self-executing treaty (Court, 2004). The Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland also examined the self-executing nature of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The issue before the court was whether Article 13(2)(b) and (c) were self-executing in nature. The court examined whether the treaty was partially self-executing and did so by checking whether there existed a minimum core content for the treaty to be applicable. The court held that it found no such provision within the treaty (A and B v Government of the Canton of Zurich, 2000).<br/><br/>It is essential to understand that these issues differ from the fundamental question of whether international law can be applied as part of the law of the land? In order to answer this question, the paper will examine the judgement by the Supreme Court of the Dominican Republic. The Supreme Court stated that Article 3 of the Dominican Republic's Constitution made international law binding on the domestic legal order. The court rejected the Superior Land Court's interpretation that these treaties were "foreign legislature" and not part of the domestic legal order. The Supreme Court laid down that all treaties ratified by the Dominican Republic formed a part of Dominican Law and, therefore, can be termed as self-executing (Gallardo Montilla v Gallardo Concepción and ors, 1997). The Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland has examined whether the Libson Treaty was self-executing and directly applicable to Swiss Universities. The court held, "According to relevant case law, a treaty norm is directly applicable if its content is sufficiently precise and clear to form the basis of a decision in a particular case. The norm thus has to be justiciable, i.e. define the rights and obligations of an individual and be directed at the competent authorities" (X v University of Lucerne, 2014). This implies that whether the treaty is directly applicable or not, depends upon on whether the norm is justiciable. The Lisbon Treaty is based on the principle of qualifications acquired aboard. This is conveyed through Article IV (1) of the treaty. The purpose of this was to create an obligation for states to show that their decision-making process is fair, transparent and non-discriminatory. The responsibility for proving that the applicant has not met the required criteria is on the "body undertaking the assessment." The treaty guarantees procedural safeguards, which are generally accepted by countries and hence, the court held this treaty to be self-executing. This goes on to showcase the different interpretations undertaken by the courts of various countries.<br/><br/>It is essential to observe whether the norms set out by treaties are actually being complied with. The case laws from various jurisdictions have emphasized that national courts are the final authority on the issue of whether a treaty is self-executing. There is also an inherent duty cast on countries for the observance and due performance of treaties. Such is cast by the Pacta Sunt Servanda rule as enshrined within Article 26 of the Vienna Convention on Law of Treaties (VCLT). Article 27 goes on to reinforce it by stating that international law obligations cannot be ignored by using domestic law as a justification. Many countries' courts have used this as a source of interpretation, such as the Latvian Constitutional Court. In the case of a national norm conflicting with an international norm, the court held that the national norm was null and void. To reach its conclusion, the court strongly relied on the necessary performance of treaties in good faith as envisaged in Article 26 of the VCLT (Linija v Latvia, 2004).<br/><br/>Conclusion:<br/><br/>From the above, it is clear that treaties have particular requirements before they can be considered self-executing. However, keeping all of these aside, the most important still remains the national courts' interpretation. The national courts decide whether the treaty can be called self-executing or not. Although their Constitution's might contain a provision regarding treaty law being the supreme law of the land, courts from different countries interpret these provisions in different manners. This can be seen as to how the American and Dominican Constitutions' both contain these provisions but follow completely different interpretations of the same. The term "self-executing" may not be congruous for these treaties since, in practice, they still need approval from the national courts. Ideally, the way forward should be that countries acknowledge the self-executing nature of treaties and treat them in a fashion wherein Article 26 and 27 of the VCLT are respected. Again, this is the "ideal" situation and is not likely to find its way into state practice of certain jurisdictions anytime soon. Still, hope can be gained via looking into the interpretations of national courts that respect these norms and hopefully pave the way for other courts to acknowledge this.<br/><br/>References:<br/><br/>Buergenthal, T.

Til dømes har Artikkel VI, Klausul 2 i den amerikanske grunnlova bestemmelser om at «alle traktatar ... skal vera den suverene lov i landet». Sjølv om det er tydeleg at traktatar i seg sjølv ikkje har same verknad som føderale lover. I røynda blir dei først operative når desse føresegnene trer i kraft som føderal lov med senats- og presidentgodkjenning. Sjølv om dette er praksis, er det eit allment akseptert prinsipp i folkeretten at visse traktatar har bindande verknad på land. Traktaten må oppfylle kravet om å vere ein sjølvstendig traktat for å påverke landet utan noko tilsvarande nasjonal lovgjeving direkte.<br/><br/>Dette reiser spørsmålet om kva for ein traktat som vil kvalifisere seg som «sjølvgjennomførande» og kva som ikkje vil?<br/><br/>Om ein traktat er ein sjølvstendig traktat eller ikkje blir avgjort av nasjonale dommarar frå sak til sak (Buergenthal, 1992). For å forstå dette vil avhandlinga først sjå på dei to typane teoriar som land følgjer om kva for traktatar som gjeld for innanriksrett. Desse to teoriane er monisme og dualisme. Dei ser i hovudsak rammeverket for nasjonal og internasjonal rett som eit enkelt hierarki og to separate hierarki, høvesvis (Wildhaber, 1971). Land som følgjer monismen trur at visse traktatar straks er bindande og har umiddelbar verknad på landet. Når traktaten er ratifisert, kan han påberopast i nasjonale domstolar og vert rekna som ein del av lova i landet. Land som følgjer dualismen meiner at ein traktat ikkje påverkar innanriksrett før han er forsterka av ei lovgjeving som er vedteken i parlamentet. Eit døme på dualisme er korleis Den europeiske menneskerettskonvensjonen blei operativ i Storbritannia etter at menneskerettsloven 1998 vart vedteken i parlamentet deira (lova, 2000).<br/><br/>Folkeretten er mangfaldig, og det same er dei prosedyrane ulike land følgjer for å godta traktatar.Nokre grunnlover nemner sjølve prosedyrene for ratifisering av ein traktat. Nokre land har til og med ulik handsaming av internasjonal traktatrett og vanleg folkerett, medan internasjonale organisasjonar som EU ofte påverkar dei nasjonale lovene i medlemslanda sine. Medlemslandene i Den europeiske unionen må gi effekt til visse former for fellesskapslovgjeving, sjølv om det har ein vesentleg skilnad frå sjølvstendige traktatar. Skilnaden er at det ikkje er opp til dei nasjonale dommarane å avgjere om føresetnadene er sjølvstendige eller ikkje, men heller at EU-domstolen skal tolka dei under sine grunnlovsfesta traktatar. Andre former for folkerett som er utforma gjennom resolusjonar eller liknande, har kanskje ikkje same verknad for desse statane, men dei kan rekna dei som former for «mjuk lov» og sjå på dei for å tolka føremålet med lova. Nokre gonger kan proklamasjonar frå rettsorgana i internasjonale organisasjonar som Den interamerikanske menneskerettsdomstolen påverka medlemslanda deira. Sjølv om desse proklamasjonane ikkje er bindande for medlemslanda, ser det ut til at dei nasjonale dommarane viser til desse for autoritativ tyding.<br/><br/>For å undersøkje konseptet med sjølvgjennomførande traktatar, vil denne oppgåva samanlikne prejudikat frå ulike jurisdiksjonar. Dersom lesaren ynskjer å gjere ei liknande analyse, kan dei gjere det ved å sjå i dei ulike nasjonale årbøkene om folkeretten. For det meste vil desse årbøkene ha ein seksjon vigd til forholdet mellom folkerett og nasjonal rett.<br/><br/>Internasjonal rettsvitskap:<br/><br/>Den viktigaste saka som kjem opp for nasjonale domstolar er om traktaten er sjølvstendig? Om traktaten kan brukast utan at det har gått gjennom fleire nasjonale lovgjevarar for å forsterke den. Dette spørsmålet kom opp i saka Czesław S mot statskassen og statsråden i statskassen, der den polske forfatningsdomstolen fastslo at sidan traktatbestemmelsene viste til nasjonale tiltak som skulle takast, var ikkje traktaten sjølvstendig i naturen (Bug river claims, Czesław S mot statskassen og statsråden i statskassen, 2003). I hovudsak, når traktaten viser til nasjonale tiltak som skal vedtas, skaper det ikkje i seg sjølv nye plikter, men forsterkar i staden intensjonen i traktaten om at den nasjonale rettsprosessen skal vedta tiltak for det same. Eit liknande spørsmål kom opp i Sosa-saken i USA, der retten vurderte om Den internasjonale konvensjonen om sivile og politiske rettar var ein sjølvstendig traktat. Den amerikanske høgsterett har òg erklært at Den internasjonale konvensjonen om sivile og politiske rettar ikkje er ein sjølvstendig traktat (Court, 2004). Den føderale høgsteretten i Sveits undersøkte òg den sjølvutøvande karakteren til Den internasjonale konvensjonen om sivile og politiske rettar.Spørsmålet for retten var om artikkel 13(2)(b) og (c) var sjølvutøvande i naturen. Retten undersøkte om traktaten var delvis sjølvstendig og gjorde det ved å sjekke om det fanst eit minste kjerneinnhald for at traktaten skulle gjelde. Retten meinte at det ikkje fanst nokon slik bestemmelse innanfor traktaten (A og B mot guvernement i kantonen Zürich, 2000).<br/><br/>Det er vesentleg å forstå at desse spørsmåla skil seg frå det grunnleggjande spørsmålet om folkeretten kan brukast som ein del av landsretten? For å få svar på dette spørsmålet vil avisa gå gjennom dommen frå Den dominikanske republikkens høgsterett. Høgsterett fastslo at artikkel 3 i Den dominikanske republikkens grunnlov gjorde folkeretten bindande for den nasjonale rettsordenen. Retten avviste Høyesterett si tolking av at desse traktatane var «framande lovgjeving» og ikkje ein del av den nasjonale rettsordenen. Høgsterett fastslo at alle traktatar ratifisert av Den dominikanske republikken utgjorde ein del av den dominikanske lova og kan derfor kallast sjølvstende (Gallardo Montilla mot Gallardo Concepción and ors, 1997). Den føderale høgsteretten i Sveits har undersøkt om Libson-traktaten var sjølvstendig og direkte gjeldande for sveitsiske universitet. Domstolen fastslo: «Ifølgje relevant rettspraksis er ein traktatnorm direkte anvendbar dersom innhaldet er presist og tydeleg nok til å danne grunnlag for eit vedtak i ei bestemt sak. Normen må dermed vere rettsleg, det vil seie definera rettane og pliktene til ein person og vere retta mot dei kompetente myndigheitene" (X mot Universitetet i Luzern, 2014). Dette inneber at om traktaten er direkte anvendbar eller ikkje, avheng av om normen er rettskraftig. Lisboa-traktaten er basert på prinsippet om kvalifikasjonar som er tileigna om bord. Dette er formidla gjennom artikkel IV nr. 1 i traktaten. Formålet med dette var å skape ei plikt for statane til å vise at vedtaksprosessen deira er rettferdig, open og ikkje-diskriminerende. Ansvaret for å bevise at søkjaren ikkje har oppfylt dei kravde kriteria ligg på "organet som gjennomfører vurderinga". Traktaten garanterer prosessuelle garantiar, som er allment aksepterte av landa, og derfor rekna domstolen denne traktaten som sjølvstendig. Dette viser dei ulike tolkingane som domstolane i ulike land har gjort.<br/><br/>Det er vesentleg å overvaka om dei traktatfesta normene faktisk blir etterlevde. Sakslovane frå ulike jurisdiksjonar har lagt vekt på at nasjonale domstolar er den endelege autoriteten i spørsmålet om ein traktat er sjølvgjennomførande. Pacta Sunt Servanda-regelen, som er nedfelt i artikkel 26 i Wien-konvensjonen om traktatrett (VCLT), er ein regel som påbyr land å overhalde og fullføra traktatar. Artikkel 27 forsterkar dette ved å slå fast at folkerettslige plikter ikkje kan oversjåast ved å bruke nasjonal lov som grunngjeving. Mange land sine domstolar har brukt dette som ei kjelde til tolking, til dømes den latviske grunnlovsdomstolen. Dersom ein nasjonal norm kjem i konflikt med ein internasjonal norm, fastset retten at den nasjonale normen var null og ugyldig. For å kome fram til konklusjonen sin, stolte domstolen sterkt på den naudsynte utføringa av traktatane i god tru, slik det er sett fram i artikkel 26 i VCLT (Linija mot Latvia, 2004).<br/><br/>Konklusjon:<br/><br/>Ut frå det ovanfor er det klart at traktatane har særskilde krav før dei kan reknast som sjølvstendige, men når ein ser bort frå alle desse, er det likevel dei nasjonale domstolane som tolkar dei viktigaste. Dei nasjonale domstolane avgjer om avtalen kan kallast sjølvstendig eller ikkje. Sjølv om grunnlova deira kan innehalde ein bestemmelse om at traktatlova er den øvste lova i landet, tolkar domstolar i ulike land desse reglane på ulike måtar. Dette kan ein sjå på korleis den amerikanske og den dominikanske grunnlova begge inneheld desse føresegnene, men følgjer heilt ulike tydingar av det same. Uttrykket «sjølvutøvande» er kanskje ikkje kongruent med desse traktatane sidan dei i praksis framleis treng godkjenning frå dei nasjonale domstolane. Ideelt sett bør vegen framover vere at land vedkjenner seg sjølvutøvande karakter av traktatar og handsamar dei på ein måte der artikkel 26 og 27 i VCLT blir respektert. Igjen, dette er den «ideelle» situasjonen og er ikkje sannsynleg å finne vegen inn i statleg praksis i visse jurisdiksjonar når som helst snart. Ein kan likevel håpe ved å sjå på tolkingane til nasjonale domstolar som respekterer desse normene og forhåpentlegvis baner veg for at andre domstolar vedkjenner seg dette.<br/><br/>Referansar:<br/><br/>Buergenthal, T.

So, you could say they have two sources of income, which is something that most people in their line of work don't have.<br/><br/>However, back in 2017, the Alaska Department of Fish and Game started a quota system, which limited the amount of fish any fishing boat could bring back to shore by half. That meant the crew on Deadliest Catch experienced a huge drop in profits for several years. Hey, at least they have Discovery to pay the bills, right? | Bak kulissene-tragediar som påverka rolla til TV's Deadliest Catch<br/><br/>Nedre fiskekvoter<br/><br/>Sjølv om mannskapet på «Deadliest Catch» gjer mesteparten av pengane sine frå «Discovery», betyr det ikkje at dei ikkje eigentleg sel pengane sine. Så ein kan seie at dei har to inntektskjelder, noko som dei fleste i yrkeslivet ikkje har.<br/><br/>Men tilbake i 2017 starta Alaska Department of Fish and Game eit kvotesystem, som avgrensa kor mykje fisk kvar fiskebåt kunne ta med seg tilbake til land med halvparten. Det betydde at mannskapet på Deadliest Catch opplevde eit enormt fall i fortjenesten i fleire år. |
| [Answer] What actor played lead greaser Danny Zuko? – Today's Trivia<br/><br/>…Primarily based on a Broadway present of the identical identify, the 1978 musical movie "Grease" took the world by storm upon its debut. Leads John Travolta (contemporary off his star-making flip in "Saturday Evening Fever") and Australian pop-nation star Olivia Newton-John made the right pair as greaser Danny Zuko and harmless new scholar Sandy Olsson. The movie follows Danny, Sandy, and pals within the late Nineteen Fifties at their highschool as they navigate love, life, friendship, and naturally, epic musical numbers.<br/><br/>John Travolta: Flawed To Assume We're Proper?

Whether it is a last-minute job request or a paper that you forgot to write and it is due the next day, stress can always find a way into your day if you allow it. Today I will show you a few things you can do to eliminate or prevent stress.<br/><br/>The first thing you can do is to exercise. Exercising is a great way to relieve stress because it lowers the stress hormone in your body known as cortisol. The lower levels of cortisol in your body, the lower your stress level will be. Exercise can also increase your confidence, and when your confidence is up then your stress is usually down. For me, when I get stressed, I always exercise by going to the gym and practice boxing, it helps me burn calories and reduce stress while having fun.<br/><br/>Writing things down has been a way to calm people down for a very long time, and it is the next topic on our list. Writing down what is making you stressed is a way to clear the mind, and it helps get rid of stress as well. I have a similar experience when writing stories, usually if I cannot think of a new idea because of an old one, I will write the old idea down and think on it. That is when new ideas start to spring up and I can continue writing normally. It is the same with stress. Think about a stream it continues to flow down it's path until it hits a beaver dam, and that dam blocks the flow of water and everything starts to build up. The only way to get the water flow back to normal is to remove the dam. This is where writing comes in. When you write it down, you are removing stress piece by piece until you can think normally again.<br/><br/>Stress can come into our lives through doors in our life that we keep open. Procrastination is a way that we can leave the doors open for stress. Waiting until tomorrow may be fun for today, but it will hurt you tomorrow, and is a very short-sighted solution. The longer you wait to do something, the larger that something becomes, and the larger it becomes the more stress you will be inviting into your life. Taking care of something as soon as we receive it is a great way to prevent stress, but it is something that takes great discipline to do. The more you cut Procrastination out of your life, the more stress free you will be. So shut that door, you're letting all the cold air out.<br/><br/>So let's review: Exercise, Write down what is stressing you, and Do not Procrastinate. These are only a few ways to relieve stress but to me, they are the most effective. While I know these may not work for everyone I would like to invite anyone feeling stressed to research how to get rid of it. | BLOGGAR<br/><br/>Sjekk ut samlinga vår av bloggar skrivne av medarbeidarar.<br/><br/>INFORMASJONSBLOGGAR<br/><br/>Ikkje stress det<br/><br/>etter<br/>Kristen Hogan<br/>Hendingar for mai 2019 › Folkemusikk<br/><br/>Stress, uansett kor bra det går, kan alltid finne ein måte å få opp det stygge hovudet sitt på. Om det er ein jobbsøknad i siste liten eller eit papir du gløymde å skrive, og det er på grunn av dagen etter, kan stress alltid finne ein måte inn i dagen din hvis du tillèt det. I dag skal eg vise dykk nokre ting de kan gjere for å fjerne eller hindre stress.<br/><br/>Det første du kan gjere er å trene. Trening er ein fin måte å avlaste stress fordi det senker stresshormonet i kroppen din kjent som kortisol. Jo lågare nivå av kortisol i kroppen din, jo lågare stressnivået ditt vil bli. Trening kan òg auke sjølvtilliten din, og når sjølvtilliten din er opp då er stresset som regel ned. For meg, når eg blir stressa, trener eg alltid ved å gå på treningsstudio og øve på boksing, det hjelper meg med å forbrenne kalorier og redusere stress samtidig som eg har det gøy.<br/><br/>Å skrive ned ting har lenge vore ein måte å roe folk ned på, og det er det neste emnet på lista vår. Å skrive ned det som stressar deg er ein måte å rydde sinnet, og det hjelper også å bli kvitt stress. Eg har ei liknande oppleving når eg skriv forteljingar, vanlegvis om eg ikkje kan tenkje på ein ny ide på grunn av ein gammal, så skriv eg ned den gamle idea og tenkjer på den. Det er då nye idear byrjar å dukke opp og eg kan halde fram med å skrive normalt. Det er det same med stress. Tenk på ein straum som held fram med å renne nedover til han treffer ei beverdemning, og at demninga blokkerer vassføringa og alt byrjar å byggje seg opp. Den einaste måten å få vassføringa tilbake til det normale på er å fjerna demninga. Når du skriv det ned, fjernar du stresset bit for bit til du kan tenkje normalt igjen.<br/><br/>Stress kan koma inn i liva våre gjennom dører som vi held opne. Utsetjing er ein måte vi kan la dørene stå opne for stress. Å venta til i morgon kan vera moro for i dag, men det vil såra deg i morgon, og er ei svært kortsiktig løysing. Jo lenger du ventar på å gjere noko, jo større blir det, og jo større blir det, jo meir stress vil du invitere inn i livet ditt. Å ta vare på noko så snart vi får det, er ein fin måte å unngå stress på, men det er noko som krev stor disiplin. Jo meir du kutter ut utsettinga ut av livet ditt, jo meir stressfri vil du bli. Så lukk den døra, du lèt all den kalde lufta gå ut.<br/><br/>Så lat oss gjera rekneskap for dei, så dei ikkje driv med utskeiingar; det er berre nokre få av dei som blir stressa, men eg er den største av dei. Sjølv om eg veit at desse kanskje ikkje fungerer for alle, vil eg gjerne invitere alle som føler seg stressa til å forske på korleis dei kan bli kvitt det. |
