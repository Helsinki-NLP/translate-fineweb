| Quidditch through the ages<br/><br/>I was doodling some quidditch-related objects like broomsticks and snitches and whatnot and it sort of turned into this odd compilation of things, including Harry down there at the bottom. I am not completely satisfied with the way it came out, but since it's not bad for my second Harry Potter fan-art picture, I decided to color it anyway. If you are wondering where his scar is, it's there, but it's very very light and small because I did that bit on the computer. Sketched in pen, colored in Paint. | Rumpeldunk gjennom tidene<br/><br/>Eg klappa nokre quidditch-relaterte gjenstandar som kosteskaft og snitches og whatnot og det vart liksom til denne rare samlinga av ting, inkludert Harry der nede nede. Eg er ikkje heilt nøgd med måten det kom ut på, men sidan det ikkje er dårleg for mitt andre Harry Potter fan-bilete, bestemte eg meg for å fargeleggje det likevel. Om du lurer på kvar arret hans er, så er det der, men det er veldig lett og lite fordi eg gjorde det litt på datamaskina. Skisset i penn, fargelagt i Paint. |
| I just started saltwater fly fishing this summer and I need a new reel, so it'll definitely be the Kraken. (I'm in Florida; we don't have those little trout minnow things around here. ) Private Message on the way to you.<br/><br/>I'm thrilled and flattered. I'm also trying to figure out a way to explain to She-Who-Must-Be-Obeyed that I'll need to buy a new rod worthy of this reel.....<br/><br/>I've always found that no explanation is the best explanation. Don't give her a reason to ever say you're not spontaneous enough. | Eg har nettopp byrja å fiske etter saltvatnsfluger i sommar og eg treng ei ny spole, så det blir definitivt Kraken. (Eg er i Florida; me har ikkje dei små ørret-minna rundt her.) Privat melding på veg til deg.<br/><br/>Eg er opprømt og smigret. Eg prøver også å finne ein måte å forklare She-Who-Must-Be-Obeyed at eg må kjøpe ein ny stang verdig dette hjulet.....<br/><br/>Eg har alltid funne at ingen forklaring er den beste forklaringa. Ikkje gje henne ei grunn til å seie at du ikkje er spontan nok. |
| If you were admitted and enrolled --> yes If you were admitted and attended another school --> yes If you took extension courses (do they even have them there? I know UCLA does) --> yes If you went to graduate school there --> yes<br/><br/>That's my interpretation because any of these scenarios would fulfill either being "admitted to an undergraduate program" or "taking courses" at UC Berkeley. I could be completely wrong though, you're better off just calling them and clarifying your specific situation.<br/><br/>My opinion: Based on the wording, I interpreted it as asking if you were admitted to Berkeley undergrad, whether or not you chose to attend. If it meant admitted and attended, they could easily have seen that through the "Undergrad Institutions" portion of the application. | Viss du vart teken opp og innskriven --> ja Viss du vart teken opp og gjekk på ein annan skule --> ja Viss du tok utvidingsfag (har dei i det heile tatt dei der? Eg veit at UCLA gjer det) --> ja Viss du gjekk ut skule der --> ja<br/><br/>Det er tolkinga mi fordi nokre av desse scenane ville oppfylle anten å bli "opptakt til eit bachelorprogram" eller "ta kurs" ved UC Berkeley. Men eg kan ta heilt feil, det er betre at du berre ringer dei og klargjer den konkrete situasjonen din.<br/><br/>MIN MENING: Basert på ordlyden, tolka eg det som å spørre om du vart tatt opp på Berkeley undergrad, om du valde å delta eller ikkje. Dersom det innebar opptak og deltaking, kunne dei lett ha sett det gjennom delen «Undergrad Institutions» i søknaden. |
| ...........A lot of the time head bolts are angle tightened so you set them at say 20Nm for a starting point then angle tighten them from there.<br/><br/>.....I would have preferred a bigger hammer<br/><br/>Cheers.<br/><br/>You can never have too big a hammer<br/><br/>I'll confess.<br/>There must be a fine distinction between torque setting with a Click torque wrench and angle setting but even as an engineer, I don't really understand it.<br/><br/>To me, if you tighten a bolt you get to a point when it locks. And as TTT says at a relatively low torque. After that, further tightening both increases the torque load and the head angle ??<br/><br/>To me it's a distinction between measurement techniques rather then final result. If anyone can explain why one instead of the other I'd be greatful ??<br/><br/>I'm sure other old farts will remember old style torque wrenches with the separate pointer that swung around a graduated scale as you put load on them.<br/>Graduated in Ft Lbs, measurement in angle.<br/>Aren't these just a variation on the theme ?? | ...........Mykje av tida er hovudboltane vinkeltette slik at ein set dei til si 20Nm for eit startpunkt og så vinkeltette dei derifrå.<br/><br/>.....Jeg ville ha foretrukket en større hammer<br/><br/>Skål.<br/><br/>Du kan aldri få for stor ein hammar<br/><br/>Eg skal tilstå.<br/>Det må vere eit fint skilje mellom dreiemomentinnstilling med ein Click dreiemomentnøkkel og vinkelinnstilling, men sjølv som ingeniør forstår eg det ikkje heilt.<br/><br/>For meg er det slik at viss du strammer ein bolt så kjem du til eit punkt når han låser seg. Og som TTT seier ved eit relativt lågt dreiemoment. Etter det aukar tilstramminga både dreiemomentlasta og hovudvinkelen??<br/><br/>For meg er det eit skilje mellom måleteknikkar heller enn sluttresultat. Om nokon kan forklara kvifor det eine i staden for det andre ville vore flott ??<br/><br/>Eg er sikker på at andre gamle fisar vil hugsa gamle momentnøklar med den separate peikaren som svinga seg rundt ein gradert skala når ein la på dei.<br/>Graduert i Ft Lbs, måling i vinkel.<br/>Er ikkje dette berre ein variant av temaet?? |
| Winter Protection for Fig Trees<br/><br/>Report This Article<br/><br/>Winter Protection for Fig Trees<br/><br/>Overview<br/><br/>The fig tree has been around since at least 5,000 B.C., and is grown throughout the world for its delicious fruit. Figs grow well in a mild climate without weather extremes. The fig tree is now propagated in some areas with harsh winters. Protective precautions are required to save the tree from winter damage.<br/><br/>Potted Fig Trees<br/><br/>Ornamental fig trees in pots can stand some freezing and do not require light once they enter the winter dormancy phase. Avoid extreme swings in temperature by placing the fig tree in a controlled environment such as a garage, where temperatures range between slightly under freezing and slight above. The plant should be watered as the soil dries.<br/><br/>Shielding<br/><br/>Shielding to protect the tree from the most extreme winter weather is required. Fig trees require placement in soil areas where the soil does not freeze to protect it from disease and increase its chances of winter survival. Large screens placed around the tree protects it from winter winds that can damage and freeze the wood.<br/><br/>Wrapping<br/><br/>Tree wrapping protects the tree from cold weather and prevents hard winds from destroying the branches. Fig tree wrapping should be applied once the leaves from the tree have fallen to prevent leaves from rotting inside the wrapping material. Fig trees are sensitive to slight temperature changes. It can not warm up inside the protective film or else the tree may begin to grow, making it susceptible to severe damage during the cold snap.<br/><br/>Planting<br/><br/>Cultivar practices help to protect the fig tree during harsh winters. Varieties that are resistant to cold weather are best for locations where the weathers are harsh. Brown Turkey, Brunswick and Blue Celeste are good cultivars for cold weather. Planting should be done against a wall or structure that will radiate heat towards the tree during the winter months.<br/><br/>Snow<br/><br/>Roots of the fig tree require dry soil during the winter dormancy period. Watering should be done only when the soil is dry and the roots should be protected from melting snow and rain. Protection placed on the ground under the tree, near the trunk--to keep water from draining into the soil--protects the tree from damage.<br/><br/>Keywords:<br/>fig tree protection, fig tree winter, fig tree care | Vintervern for fikentre<br/><br/>Rapporter denne artikkelen<br/><br/>Vintervern for fikentre<br/><br/>Oversyn<br/><br/>Fikentreet har eksistert sidan minst 5000 f.Kr., og veks over heile verda på grunn av den deilige frukta. Fikentreet veks godt i eit mildt klima utan vêrekstre. Fikentreet er no utbreidd i enkelte område med harde vintrar. Det er naudsynt med vernetiltak for å redde treet frå skade om vinteren.<br/><br/>Pottefikentre<br/><br/>Prydfikentre i potter kan stå noko iskald og krev ikkje lys når dei går inn i vinterdvalefasen.

Fikentreinnpakning bør brukast når blada frå treet har falle ned for å hindre at blada råtnar inne i innpakningsmaterialet. Fikentrea er følsomme for små temperaturendringar. Dei kan ikkje varme seg opp inne i beskyttelsesfilmen, elles kan treet byrja å vekse, noko som gjer det sårbart for alvorlege skadar under den kalde snøgginga.<br/><br/>Planting<br/><br/>Dyrking av fikentreet under harde vintrar. Varianter som er resistente mot kaldt vêr er best for stader der vêret er hardt. Brun Tyrkia, Brunswick og Blue Celeste er gode kultivarer for kaldt vêr.

| Oculus CEO comes down hard on Mac support for the Rift<br/><br/>Oculus CEO, Palmer Luckey, has not minced his words when asked in an interview whether the Rift VR headset will ever support the Mac. If you had any hopes of it being soon, you might want to ready yourselves for some disappointment.<br/><br/>That is up to Apple. If they ever release a good computer, we will do it.<br/><br/>What he's referring to there in a less diplomatic sense is the discrete graphics required to run the Rift. The simple truth is that Apple just doesn't go for high-end graphics that will meet the requirements for the headset. For context, on a Windows PC, you need a minimum of an NVIDIA GTX 970, a $300 graphics card.<br/><br/>As Luckey went on to say:<br/><br/>It just boils down to the fact that Apple doesn't prioritize high-end GPUs. You can buy a $6,000 Mac Pro with the top of the line AMD FirePro D700, and it still doesn't match our recommended specs. So if they prioritize higher-end GPUs like they used to for a while back in the day, we'd love to support Mac. But right now, there's just not a single machine out there that supports it.<br/><br/>The Mac Pro can't be accused of not packing plenty of horsepower, because it does, but equally FirePro graphics are targeted more towards the creative market, just like the Mac Pro. The Mac Pro in particular far exceeds other hardware requirements, but naturally as the Rift is graphics heavy, this is where the shortfall is. Luckey is perhaps being a little over the top, but equally he's the man behind the Rift, so there's no doubts plenty of truth to what he says. Even if he doesn't say it particularly well.<br/><br/>What say you, Mac owners of the world? Are you even bothered about the Oculus Rift or is it something you wish you could have? Sound off in the comments below!<br/><br/>Reader comments<br/><br/>Oculus CEO comes down hard on Mac support for the Rift<br/><br/>No, not bothered by it since I really wasn't planning on buying an Oculus Rift. For me the product category is still too early and too much in a beta-kinda phase. But he does rise a valid point. Apple should try to get more ahead of the pack CPU/GPU wise. Right now they're always trailing behind.<br/><br/>Excuse me, but what is HTC Vive better at? And Oculus Rift most certainly supports Linux machines that meet their hardware specifications! (The issue is not OS but hardware.)<br/><br/>Also, look at WHY the HTC Vive supports OS X: it includes more of its own hardware. (Which is why it costs so much.) The Oculus solutions - both the Rift and the Samsung Gear VR - require the hardware that it is plugging into to perform more of the heavy lifting.<br/><br/>VR isn't a gimmick. 3D TVs don't always give that much of a 3d effect, and it doesn't work with everyone. VR works with everyone, and the Oculus and HTC Vive official release products have almost no latency so there shoudn't be any motion sickness. There's also plenty of game support<br/><br/>Obviously if gaming is a priority you're generally not in the market for a Mac, though. Not many game developers support OSX so these types of devices likely have limited use on a Mac (for gaming, anyways, which the Rift was designed for). At least that's the only reason I could see myself using one. I definitely wouldn't use it for watching movies.<br/><br/>Apple did implement the Metal engine into El Capitan, there might be some plan to go into the gaming market (as Apple learned from iOS how big this market is, just look at the top grossing apps).<br/>So now the hardware is missing and and game devs would probably show some interest, since Macs there are now an acceptable amount of Mac users around the world.<br/><br/>I would like to see Apple make its way into that sector of the industry. I don't use any Apple products presently but they're making a lot of the right moves in many areas and I'm very intrigued.<br/><br/>Plus, competition fuels innovation. I know that major computer part manufactures already create that competition but Apple has the RnD willpower and the cash to really turn heads. They may not win the numbers games in terms of specs, they actually rarely do, but most people who care to do the research know that performance != the sum of the device's parts. Apple can do more with "less". On paper their products appear inferior but when carefully balanced hardware meets specifically engineered software they generally perform just as well as the competition if not out perform.<br/><br/>HA! I love how, all of a sudden, having a high performance computer is not important to Apple phans! There is not a single Mac capable of the highest end graphics. Can't buy one, can't build one. Mac is not capable of being the highest in performance and you are good with that. HA! Classic!<br/><br/>I bought my MacBook Pro Retina in 2012 because of the high resolution screen and the non-discrete GPU. However, for my desktop I built a system with a 4K monitor, i7 4790K CPU, 3 GTX 970 GPU's, and 16 gb of memory all for less than what I'd pay for an iMac. I even have an SSD set up to boot in OSX. My point is Apple could do similar things if it wished, but doesn't. In fact, look at the most recent iMac. It includes discrete graphics and a slow 5400 RPM drive. My computer may not look as pretty, and it's not as thin, but in the end it's more useful - isn't that why we buy a computer in the first place?<br/><br/>I don't see why a Mac pro can not make use of the Oculus isn't it built for rendering video. I understand that it will not be able to run on iMac's and because of this the Oculus should be branded for Pro users due to the requirements and come at the price.<br/><br/>Now people are saying that your computer is doing ALL the heavy lifting, so why is the price point over $800 for something that isn't doing anything?<br/><br/>I'm excited about the direction of VR but not where it is at the moment.<br/><br/>Your display (which the Rift is) never does any of the heavy lifting. It's $800 because of what the display does; 110° viewing angle (still not human eye but much closer than other displays) with super low latency to reduce or eliminate motion sickness on a 1200x1800 per eye display for HD quality.<br/><br/>And yes, Mac's are very widely used for video rendering, but that rendering doesn't happen at 30+fps. It can take video rendering machines hours to render a single frame and sometimes years to render an entire movie. The final products, or pre-rendered material, is what then becomes 30+fps.<br/><br/>Thank you @TheRealFixxer<br/>Alot of what you say makes sense and some I was unaware of.<br/><br/>I guess I don't see VR as a game, but as an immersion and seeing Mac's are good at 3dcad and compiling video I would think they would be able to compile a scene well. I've even seen 3d renders of movie walk through. Creating a 3d world and placing cameras in areas to figure out how a scene would look<br/><br/>But I agree Mac's make more use of CPU cycles even by using there GPU's to help. WIth that said there are other directions one could take it. Like external thunderbolt video cards.<br/><br/>My big grip is the fact Octulas is looked at as a consumer product. If the requirements are that high, then it's more a pro product and needs to be advertized as that. I understand the technology is there but don't feel it's there to call it a consumer product.<br/><br/>Yes, you are right. Apple also has issues with software. Most aren't using "metal" the apple programming language which speeds up the processing for games because it's an Apple only solution where many use game engines that work on Microsoft Direct X or open source Opengl which most games use to run on Linux and oSX. Opengl is around 20% slower and sometime a lot more than that compared to direct x so a top of the line gaming card running in oSX runs as fast is a mid level gaming card in windows. So big problems not to mention most macs have built in cards that have no upgradability.<br/><br/>The mac pro is so different that Apple would have to do this as it wouldn't be worth a card vendor doing this as there is no profit in it for them with the small amount of possible buyers there would be for this. Apple doesn't like to loose money so I don't see this ever happening. Apple would loose money offering video card upgrades for mac pros.<br/><br/>Well he has a point though I do t care about oculus rift, rather wait for starVR. There should be an option to add better GPUs into an iMac and MacBook Pro. It is also sad that there is no more nVidia card, I liked the CUDA support now I will have to buy a PC and install Linux for my CUDA projects.<br/><br/>Gaming is a growing market and it won't be long until even iPhones have more GPU performance than the Macs. I agree that Apple should offer a high end GPU in a Mac<br/><br/>I am very bothered by the lack of high performance discrete graphics on Mac computers. Even the top of the like iMac uses an out of date mobile GPU which, of course, cannot be upgraded. If I want to develop software for VR, Apple has left me no choice but to buy or build a PC to run it on. As a big Apple fan (yes I admit it) this make me rather sad.<br/><br/>BTW, VR is not some passing fad. If you have tried it you know what I mean. VR is going to change gaming and content creation forever. My only worry about VR is that is too good. There could be millions of people that will become addicted to living and playing in virtual worlds. Look at how many people got addicted to MMOs that played on a flat screen. With VR you really feel like you are in the game.<br/><br/>Not worried about anything, i am pretty sure apple will have its own implementation for Mac and iOS when tech will be ready for consumers, right now it is more for hardcore users. Like always apple like to time its presence on right time, with right product. Have faith in apple.<br/><br/>It's funny that a lot of people know which vr is better based on os support. I guess you guys did heavy testing and now are the guy in the big electronic store that knows best.<br/><br/>HTC said it will bring support to the osx but that still needs to be seen.<br/><br/>I understand that a lot of you guys are stamped on there d**ks. But understand that Apple is more focused on laptops. And laptops can't be packed with more power than a PC, due to size, heat, power consumption etc.<br/><br/>He is right, even though he put it in **** terms. I love my Mac but Lord it needs a boost in graphics. Not that it needs to cost more but I would be more than willing to pay a little extra for a better graphics card or at least have the option to install my own. It's really too bad this guy had to make his statement sound like he is just plain uneducated. | Oculus-sjefen kjem hardt ned på Mac-støtte for Rift<br/><br/>Palmer Luckey, administrerende direktør i Oculus, har ikkje kommentert orda sine då han vart spurt i eit intervju om Rift VR-headsettet nokon gong vil støtta Macen. Viss du hadde håp om at det kom snart, vil du kanskje gjere deg klar for å bli skuffa.<br/><br/>Det er opp til Apple. Om dei nokon gong kjem med ei god datamaskin, så kjem vi til å gjere det.<br/><br/>Det han refererer til der i ein mindre diplomatisk forstand er den diskrete grafikken som trengst for å køyre Rift. Den enkle sanninga er at Apple berre ikkje går for avansert grafikk som vil oppfylle krava til headsettet. For samanheng, på ein Windows-PC, treng du minst eit NVIDIA GTX 970, eit grafikkort for $300.<br/><br/>Som Luckey sa vidare:<br/><br/>Det kokar berre ned til det faktum at Apple ikkje prioriterer avanserte GPU-ar. Du kan kjøpe ein $ 6 000 Mac Pro med toppen av linja AMD FirePro D700, og den samsvarar framleis ikkje med våre anbefalte spesifikasjonar. Så om dei prioriterer høgare grafikkprosessorar slik dei brukte ei stund tilbake, vil vi gjerne støtte Mac. Men akkurat no er det berre ikkje ein einaste maskin der ute som støttar det.<br/><br/>Mac Pro kan ikkje skuldast for ikkje å pakke mykje hestekrefter, fordi det gjer det, men likeså er FirePro-grafikken meir målretta mot den kreative marknaden, akkurat som Mac Pro. Spesielt Mac Pro overgår langt andre maskinvarekrav, men sjølvsagt sidan Rift er grafikktung, er det her mangelen ligg. Luckey er kanskje litt over toppen, men like fullt er han mannen bak Riften, så det er ikkje tvil om at det er mykje sanning i det han seier, sjølv om han ikkje seier det særleg godt.<br/><br/>Kva synest de, Mac-eigarar av verda? Er de enno irriterte over Oculus Rift, eller er det noko de ønskjer at de kunne ha? Kjemp imot i kommentarane nedanfor!<br/><br/>Lesarkommentarar<br/><br/>Oculus-sjefen kjem hardt ned på Mac-støtte for Rift<br/><br/>Nei, ikkje brydd av det sidan eg verkeleg ikkje hadde planar om å kjøpe ein Oculus Rift. For meg er produktkategorien framleis for tidleg og for mykje i ein beta-liknande fase. Men han hevar eit gyldig punkt. Apple bør prøve å få meir framom pakken CPU/GPU klokt. Akkurat no ligg dei alltid bak.<br/><br/>Unnskyld meg, men kva er HTC Vive betre på? Og Oculus Rift støttar absolutt Linux-maskinar som oppfyller maskinvarespesifikasjonane sine! (Problemet er ikkje OS, men maskinvare.)<br/><br/>Sjå òg på kvifor HTC Vive støttar OS X: det inkluderer meir av sin eigen maskinvare. (Hvilket er grunnen til at det kostar så mykje.) Oculus-løysingane – både Rift og Samsung Gear VR – krev maskinvaren som dei koplar seg til for å kunne utføre meir av det tunge løfta.<br/><br/>VR er ikkje eit gimmick. 3D-TV-ar gjev ikkje alltid så mykje av ein 3D-effekt, og det fungerer ikkje med alle. VR fungerer med alle, og dei offisielle utgjevingsprodukta til Oculus og HTC Vive har nesten ingen ventetid, så det skal ikkje vere nokon rørslesjuke. Det er òg mykje spelstøtte<br/><br/>Sjølvsagt, viss spel er ein prioritet er du generelt ikkje i marknaden for ein Mac. Ikkje mange spelutviklarar støttar OSX, så denne typen einingar har sannsynlegvis avgrensa bruk på ein Mac (for spel, uansett, som Rift var meint for). I det minste var det den einaste grunnen til at eg kunne sjå meg sjølv bruke ein. Eg ville definitivt ikkje bruke den til å sjå filmar.<br/><br/>Apple implementerte Metal-motoren i El Capitan, det kan vere nokre planar om å gå inn i spelmarknaden (som Apple lærte av iOS kor stor denne marknaden er, berre sjå på dei øvste appane).<br/>Så no manglar maskinvaren og og spelutviklarar ville truleg vise noko interesse, sidan Macar det no er ei akseptabel mengd Mac-brukarar rundt om i verda.<br/><br/>Eg vil gjerne sjå at Apple kjem seg inn i den sektoren av industrien. Eg brukar ingen Apple-produkt for tida, men dei gjer mange av dei rette trekka på mange område, og eg er veldig fascinert.<br/><br/>Eg veit at store dataprodusentar allereie skaper den konkurransen, men Apple har viljestyrken og pengane til å verkeleg snu hovud. Dei kan ikkje vinne talespela når det gjeld specs, det gjer dei faktisk sjeldan, men dei fleste som bryr seg om å gjere forskinga veit at ytinga != summen av delane av eininga.Apple kan gjere meir med «mindre». På papiret framstår produkta deira som underlegne, men når nøye balansert maskinvare møter spesifikt konstruert programvare presterer dei generelt like godt som konkurrentane om dei ikkje presterer.<br/><br/>HA! Eg elskar at det plutselig ikkje er viktig for Apple-fans å ha ei datamaskin med høg yting! Det finst ikkje ein einaste Mac som er i stand til den høgaste grafikken. Kan ikkje kjøpa ein, kan ikkje byggja ein. Mac er ikkje i stand til å vere den høgaste i yting, og du er god med det. HA! Classic!<br/><br/>Eg kjøpte MacBook Pro Retina i 2012 på grunn av den høge oppløysingsskjermen og den ikkje-diskrete GPU-en, men for skrivebordet bygde eg eit system med ein 4K-skjerm, i7 4790K CPU, 3 GTX 970 GPU-ar og 16 gb minne alt for mindre enn det eg ville betalt for ein iMac. Eg har til og med ein SSD sett opp for å starte opp i OSX. Poenget mitt er at Apple kunne gjere liknande ting om det ønskte, men det gjør det ikke. Faktisk, sjå på den nyaste iMac. Det inkluderer diskret grafikk og ein treg 5400 RPM-stasjon. Datamaskina mi ser kanskje ikkje så pen ut, og ho er ikkje så tynn, men til slutt er ho meir nyttig - er det ikkje derfor me kjøper ei datamaskin i utgangspunktet?<br/><br/>Eg ser ikkje kvifor ein Mac-proff ikkje kan nytte Oculus er ikkje det bygd for rendering av video. Eg forstår at det ikkje vil vere i stand til å køyre på iMac og på grunn av dette bør Oculus vera merket for Pro-brukarar på grunn av krava og kjem til prisen.<br/><br/>No seier folk at datamaskina di gjer alt det tunge løfta, så kvifor er prispunktet over 800 dollar for noko som ikkje gjer noko?<br/><br/>Eg er spent på retninga til VR, men ikkje der det er for tida.<br/><br/>Visinga di (som Rift er) gjer aldri noko av det tunge løfta. Det er $800 på grunn av kva skjermen gjer; 110° synsvinkel (ennå ikkje menneskeøyne, men mykje nærare enn andre skjermar) med super låg ventetid for å redusera eller eliminere rørslesjuke på ein 1200×1800 per augeskjerm for HD-kvalitet.<br/><br/>Og ja, Mac-ar er mykje brukt til videoframsyning, men den framsyninga skjer ikkje ved 30+ fps. Det kan ta fleire timar å framsyna eit enkelt bilete, og nokre gonger fleire år å framsyna ein heil film. Dei ferdige produkta, eller førehandsframstilt materiale, er det som då vert 30+ fps.<br/><br/>Takk til @TheRealFixxer<br/>Mykje av det du seier er fornuftig og noko var eg uvitande om.<br/><br/>Eg trur ikkje eg ser VR som eit spel, men som ei fordjuping og å sjå Mac'ar er gode på 3dcad og kompilering av video trur eg dei vil vere i stand til å kompilere ein scene godt. Eg har til og med sett 3d-rendringar av film walk through. Laga ein 3D-verd og plasserte kamera i område for å finne ut korleis ei scene ville sjå ut<br/><br/>Men eg er enig i at Mac brukar CPU-syklusar meir, sjølv ved å bruke det GPU-ar for å hjelpe. Med det sagt er det andre retningar ein kan ta det. Som eksterne thunderbolt skjermkort.<br/><br/>Mitt store grep er at Octulas blir sett på som eit forbrukarprodukt. Om krava er så høge, så er det meir eit proffprodukt og må annonserast som det. Eg forstår at teknologien er der, men eg føler ikkje at den er der for å kalle det eit forbrukarprodukt.<br/><br/>Ja, du har rett. Apple har òg problem med programvare. Dei fleste nyttar ikkje «metall» som Apples programmeringsspråk som gjer behandlinga for spel raskare fordi det er ei einaste Apple-løysing der mange brukar spelmotorar som fungerer på Microsoft Direct X eller Opengl som dei fleste spel brukar til å køyre på Linux og oSX. Opengl er rundt 20 % tregare og stundom mykje meir enn det samanlikna med direkte x så ein øvst på linja spelekort som køyrer i oSX køyrer like fort som eit mellomnivå spelekort i windows. Så store problem, for ikkje å snakke om at dei fleste Mac-ar har innebygde kort som ikkje har nokon oppgraderingsmulighet.<br/><br/>Mac-proffen er så forskjellig at Apple ville måtte gjere dette sidan det ikkje ville vore verdt ein kortseljar å gjere dette sidan det ikkje er noko profitt i det for dei med den vesle mengda av moglege kjøparar det ville vere for dette. Apple liker ikkje å tape pengar, så eg ser ikkje at dette nokon gong skjer. Apple ville tape pengar ved å tilby skjermkortoppgraderingar for Mac-proffar.<br/><br/>Vel, han har eit poeng, sjølv om eg ikkje bryr meg om oculus rift, vent heller på starVR. Det bør vere eit alternativ å legge til betre GPU-ar i ein iMac og MacBook Pro. Det er også trist at det ikkje er meir nVidia-kort, eg likte CUDA-støtten no må eg kjøpe ein PC og installere Linux for mine CUDA-prosjekt.<br/><br/>Spel er ein veksande marknad, og det vil ikkje ta lang tid før sjølv iPhone har meir GPU-ytelse enn Mac-ane. Eg er enig i at Apple bør tilby ein avansert GPU i ein Mac<br/><br/>Eg er veldig plaga av mangelen på høgtytande diskret grafikk på Mac-maskinar. Sjølv toppen av liknande iMac brukar ein utdatert mobil GPU som sjølvsagt ikkje kan oppgraderast. Dersom eg ønskjer å utvikle programvare for VR, har Apple ikkje gjeve meg noko anna val enn å kjøpe eller bygge ein PC til å køyre på. Som ein stor Apple-fan (ja, eg innrømmer det) gjer dette meg ganske trist.<br/><br/>BTW, VR er ikkje noko forbigåande kjepphest. Viss du har prøvd det, veit du kva eg meiner. VR kjem til å endra spel og innhaldsskaping for alltid. Den einaste bekymringa mi om VR er at det er for godt. Det kan vera millionar av menneske som vert avhengige av å leva og spela i virtuelle verder. Sjå kor mange som vart avhengige av MMO-spel som vart spela på ein flat skjerm. Med VR føler du deg verkeleg som ein del av spelet.<br/><br/>Ikkje bekymret for noko, eg er ganske sikker på at Apple vil ha sin eigen implementering for Mac og iOS når tech vil vere klar for forbrukarar, akkurat no er det meir for hardcore-brukarar. Som alltid liker eplet å tidfeste nærværet sitt til rett tid, med rett produkt. Ha tillit til eplet.<br/><br/>Det er morosamt at mange veit kva for ein vr som er betre basert på os-støtte. Eg trur at de har testa hardt og no er fyren i den store elektronikkbutikken som veit best.<br/><br/>HTC sa at det vil gje støtte til osx, men at det framleis må sjåast.<br/><br/>Eg forstår at mange av dykk er stemplet på det d**ks. Men forstå at Apple er mer fokusert på bærbare datamaskiner. Og bærbare datamaskiner kan ikkje pakkes med meir kraft enn ein PC, på grunn av storleik, varme, strømforbruk etc.<br/><br/>Han har rett, sjølv om han sette det i **** vilkår. Eg elskar Macen min, men Herre det treng eit løft i grafikken. Ikkje at det treng å koste meir, men eg ville vore meir enn villig til å betale litt ekstra for eit betre grafikkort eller i det minste ha høve til å installere mitt eige. Det er verkeleg synd at denne fyren måtte få uttalelsen sin til å høyrast ut som om han berre er reint uutdanna. |
| The Masjid in the American Landscape: Civic Rights<br/><br/>Twelfth graders examine and explain legal rights designed to protect religious liberty. They evaluate the extent to which the First Amendment protects religious practices. They research and describe current and past legal battles over religious zoning and buildings. They discuss whether restrictions should be placed on where religious buildings are built.<br/><br/>What Members Say<br/><br/>As an online high school teacher, LP has helped me tremendously with extra resources! I have been able to use additional supplemental materials from here and students are able to gain more knowledge and a different perspective. | Masjid i det amerikanske landskapet: borgarrett<br/><br/>Tolvteklassingane undersøkjer og forklarar juridiske rettar som er laga for å verna om religionsfridom. Dei vurderer i kva grad det første grunnlovstillegget vernar religiøs praksis. Dei forskar og skildrar noverande og tidlegare juridiske kampar om religiøs regulering og bygningar, og diskuterer om det bør setjast avgrensingar på kor religiøse bygningar skal byggjast.<br/><br/>Kva medlemmane seier<br/><br/>Som nettbasert høgskulelærar har LP hjelpt meg enormt med ekstra ressursar! Eg har vore i stand til å bruke tilleggsmateriale herifrå og studentane har fått meir kunnskap og eit anna perspektiv. |
| What Guys Said 19<br/><br/>No, it is because entertainment producers and product marketers want actors/actresses and models who look like the majority of the audience, so that they are relatable and therefore more effective sales tools. I am sure that Asian women look wonderful to Asian men. To me, as a white man, they have zero appeal.<br/><br/>@cowboy101 I am 100 per cent straight. I do not go outside of my race. When I was a soldier I had the "me love you long time" experience in Asia. That has left me feeling uncomfortable whenever there are Asian females near me. Sometimes I become profoundly uncomfortable, even though the particular individuals have done nothing to merit it. During a visit to Thailand, I found that the only way to prevent myself being propositioned on the street was to take white a female with me as a minder.<br/><br/>Aha the thing is that there isn't many white people (or any at all) in China, but in 'white' places, (or at least Australia) there are quite a lot of Asians around there, which made me think about this question...<br/><br/>Maybe in parts of the country where you stick at (remember, birds of a feather...), just like to republicans it seems that most people are republican etc. While it can only be small minority that you are surrounded by.<br/><br/>And as far as I know, there are a lot of whites in china, mainly by business, etc. But it's simple, most of people there are Asian, so they prefere Asian girls (dogs like dogs , cats like cats, most people prefere their own kind). And there is nothing wrong with that. Same is in white countries.<br/><br/>I think Asians are the most beautful. Unfortunately for me the 2 I got involved with in my life one was using me for my place/internet a long time ago and the recent one was a gold digging stupid bitch. She never graduated college and was 30. I would be extremely happy if I met a smart cute Asian woman near my age that was not a gold digger.<br/><br/>@Prettyapathetic yes because when a man loves deeply he always good with you on bed no matter size of tits or colour of skin and a real man always respect a girl in every relation like mother, sister, wife, girlfriend etc<br/><br/>as a model from childhood I got my start with a company called sugar & spice. I was recruited in Japan while my family was stationed there.<br/><br/>you get a job because they are going for a certain look, who are they targeting, and the area you live in.<br/><br/>I had to leave the industry last year because of health reasons. I worked with with many types of people, korean, Japanese, chinese, polish, german, American, Spanish, arabic. I've worked with children, adults, teenagers all of these ethnicities.<br/><br/>I am half white half Native American (Lakota) so they loved my look from a young age. but there are many beauty standards in the industry and not all of them are as portrayed, some being made to look worse, and some not taken seriously enough...<br/><br/>Nope, it's because the Asian men are jealous and angry and invent thousands of excuses every rare time who have Asian women in the media because they are jealous of Asian women, and Americans want to keep the status of white women, this is why the couples between Asian women and white men are boycotted and all other race with white women are pushed, it's white women wiht white men and white women with other races in American media, since it's opression and offensive for the ego of men of other race the women of own race with white but white women with other race is "anti-racism". You need to understand the American political social engineering all over these years of media, democrats, politics and propaganda.<br/><br/>Anyway, in countries like china, japan, korea they have Asian men and Asian women only and the only exceptions are when they import a white women to make some fantasy scene for them but it's not so much, it's forbiden expose the hatred and jealousy of some Asian men.<br/><br/>The Asian boys will be happy if you say something against other men, but they will be angry if you say that the Asian girl will die for the blond girl date the handsome caucasian/white dude, they will try to force Asian women to make anything against these men to these small vocal group of Asian men feel better in their hatred, excuses, racism and jealousy. This is why Asian women is not showed so much, it's because the Asian men will be angry, it's because the white women can't be replaced, and the American propaganda is around white women with white men, white women with other race, white women against white men for the other race of men, white women in everything.<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>1&#124;0<br/><br/>0&#124;0<br/><br/>Opinion Owner<br/><br/>1mo<br/><br/>All the excuses of media and propaganda and all lies for racism, jealousy and hate aren't used against white women by the same men who invent the excuses, white women all the time in the media, understand, the American social engineering is made by democrats, democrats hate white men, and the most popular couples would be white men and Asian women but it's horrible for a few group of white racists who are racists even against Asians, is bad for the angry Asian men and their excuses, is bad for the white women, the democrats really don't like white men and work hard to try to make the couple and anything wiht white men and non-white women be related to bad things while pushing white women and non-white men. It's a American political problem.<br/><br/>I think it's a opression against the ego of the men of other race, so the white guys need to look bad, be some sort of jokes, be soft, while the scenes with white women and other race is the opposite of the scenes of white men and non-white women | Kva folk sa 19<br/><br/>Nei, det er fordi underhaldningsprodusentar og produktmarknadsførarar vil ha skodespelarar/skuespelarar og modellar som liknar mest på publikum, slik at dei er relatable og derfor meir effektive salsverktøy. Eg er sikker på at asiatiske kvinner ser fantastiske ut for asiatiske menn. For meg, som ein kvit mann, har dei null appell.<br/><br/>@cowboy101 Eg er 100% straight. Eg går ikkje utanfor min rase. Då eg var soldat hadde eg "me love you long long" opplevinga i Asia. Det har gjort at eg føler meg ukomfortabel når det er asiatiske kvinner i nærleiken av meg. Av og til blir eg djupt ukomfortabel, sjølv om dei enkelte individa ikkje har gjort noko for å fortjene det. Under eit besøk i Thailand fann eg ut at den einaste måten å hindre meg i å bli foreslått på gata var å ta med meg ei kvit kvinne som mindreårig.<br/><br/>Aha tingen er at det ikkje er mange kvite folk (eller nokon i det heile tatt) i Kina, men på 'kvite' stader, (eller i det minste Australia) er det ganske mange asiatar der ute, som fekk meg til å tenke på dette spørsmålet...<br/><br/>Kanskje i delar av landet der ein held til (husk, fuglar med fjør ...), akkurat som til republikanarar ser det ut til at dei fleste er republikanarar etc. Medan det berre kan vere ein liten minoritet som ein er omringa av.<br/><br/>Og så vidt eg veit er det mange kvite i Kina, hovudsakleg av forretningsmessige årsaker, etc. Men det er enkelt, dei fleste der er asiatiske, så dei føretrekkjer asiatiske jenter (hundar som hundar , katter som katter, dei fleste føretrekkjer sitt eige slag). Og det er ikkje noko gale med det; det same er i kvite land.<br/><br/>Eg synest asiatar er dei vakraste. Dessverre for meg var dei 2 eg vart involvert med i livet mitt ein brukte meg til min plass/internett for lenge sidan og den siste var ei gullgravande dum hurpe. Ho tok aldri høgskuleeksamen og var 30. Eg ville vore ekstremt glad om eg møtte ei smart, søt asiatisk kvinne nær min alder som ikkje var ein gullgravar.<br/><br/>@Prettyapathetic ja fordi når ein mann elskar djupt han alltid godt med deg i senga uansett storleik på pupper eller hudfarge og ein ekte mann alltid respekterer ei jente i alle forhold som mor, søster, kone, kjæreste etc.<br/><br/>Som modell frå barndomen starta eg hos eit firma som heiter Sugar & Spice. Eg vart rekruttert i Japan medan familien min var stasjonert der.<br/><br/>du får jobb fordi dei går etter ei viss utsjånad, kven dei siktar mot, og kva område du bur i.<br/><br/>Eg måtte forlate industrien i fjor på grunn av helsemessige årsaker. Eg arbeidde med mange typar menneske, koreansk, japansk, kinesisk, polsk, tysk, amerikansk, spansk, arabisk. Eg har arbeidd med barn, vaksne, tenåringar av alle desse etnisitetane.<br/><br/>Eg er halvt kvit halv indianar (Lakota) så dei elska utsjånaden min frå ein ung alder. men det er mange skjønnhetsstandardar i bransjen og ikkje alle av dei er som portrettert, nokre blir gjort verre, og nokre blir ikkje tekne seriøst nok...<br/><br/>Nope, det er fordi dei asiatiske mennene er sjalu og sinte og finn opp tusenvis av unnskyldningar kvar sjeldan gang som har asiatiske kvinner i media fordi dei er sjalu på asiatiske kvinner, og amerikanarar ønskjer å halde statusen til kvite kvinner, dette er grunnen til at para mellom asiatiske kvinner og kvite menn blir boikotta og alle andre rase med kvite kvinner blir pressa på andre rase- det er kvite kvinner med rase- men kvite kvinner med antirasisme for «for kvite menn og kvite menn med andre rasar» av o av o av ue i amerikanske media Du må forstå den amerikanske politiske sosialteknikken gjennom alle desse åra med media, demokratar, politikk og propaganda.<br/><br/>Uansett, i land som Kina, Japan, Korea har dei berre asiatiske menn og asiatiske kvinner og dei einaste unntaka er når dei importerer ein kvit kvinne for å lage ein fantasiscene for dei, men det er ikkje så mykje, det er forbode å avsløre hatet og sjalusien til nokre asiatiske menn.<br/><br/>Dei asiatiske gutane vil bli glade om du seier noko mot andre menn, men dei vil bli sinte om du seier at den asiatiske jenta vil døy for den blonde jentedaten den kjekka kaukasiske/kvit dude, dei vil prøve å tvinge asiatiske kvinner til å få noko mot desse mennene til desse små vokalgruppa av asiatiske menn til å kjenna seg betre i hatet sitt, unnskyldningane, rasismen og sjalusien deira. Dette er grunnen til at asiatiske kvinner ikkje vert vist så mykje, det er fordi dei asiatiske mennene vil verte sinte, det er fordi dei kvite kvinnene ikkje kan bli erstatta, og den amerikanske propagandaen er rundt kvite kvinner med kvite menn, kvite kvinner med ein annan rase, kvite kvinner mot kvite menn for den andre rasen av menn, kvite kvinner i alt.<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>1&#124;0<br/><br/>0&#124;0<br/><br/>Opningseigar<br/><br/>1 månad<br/><br/>Alle unnskyldningane frå media og propaganda og alle løgner om rasisme, sjalusi og hat blir ikkje brukt mot kvite kvinner av dei same mennene som finn på unnskyldningane, kvite kvinner heile tida i media, forstå, den amerikanske sosialteknikken er laga av demokratar, demokratar er harde kvite kvinner som verkeleg hatar kvite menn, og dei mest populære para deira er kvite menn og asiatiske kvinner, men det er fælt for dei kvite menn og ikkje for dei som er rasistiske. Det er eit amerikansk politisk problem.<br/><br/>Eg trur det er ei undertrykking mot egoet til menn av annan rase, så dei kvite må sjå slemme ut, vere ein slags spøk, vere mjuke, medan scenene med kvite kvinner og andre rase er det motsette av scenene med kvite menn og ikkje-kvite kvinner |
