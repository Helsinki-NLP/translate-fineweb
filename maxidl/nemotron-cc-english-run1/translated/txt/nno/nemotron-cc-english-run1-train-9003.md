| The Masterpiece: a Chain Poetry Challenge<br/><br/>John has been writing poetry since his school days. He was awarded the "Best Poet 2014 and 2021" Hubby Awards.<br/><br/>Madame Monet in a Japanese kimono, 1875<br/><br/>Claude Monet [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>A Brief History of Collaborative, Collective, or Chain Poetry<br/><br/>Collaborative,collective, or chain poetry is an alternative and creative technique for writing poetry by more than one person. The principal aim of this type of poetry is to create poems through the collaboration of various authors/poets, trying to form a unified voice while still maintain their individual voices.<br/><br/>Examples of collaboration abound in Japanese poetry. Though the precise accounts and records of many such events are either lost or missing.<br/><br/>One of the most famous examples of collective poetry writing was the poem collection titled Ralentir Travaux by Surrealist French poets André Breton, Paul Éluard and René Char. These three poets collaborated to write the poems in this collection over just five days in 1930.<br/><br/>During the 1940s, Charles Henri Ford, an American poet, invented what he called the "chain poem", where each poet wrote a line and then sent the poem to another person (to continue) in another part of the world, by post.<br/><br/>In 2007 a collection of American collaborative poetry Saints of Hysteria: A Half-Century of Collaborative American Poetry was edited and published by Denise Duhamel, Maureen Seaton and David Trinidad.<br/><br/>Collaborative poetry writing has been used in schools and colleges to teach students teamwork and to discover ways in which they are connected.(source: Wikipedia)<br/><br/>Study of a Figure Outdoors: Woman with a Parasol, facing left, 1886<br/><br/>Claude Monet [Public domain or Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>The Aim of This Article and How to Approach the Challenge<br/><br/>A few years back I wrote an article called "Poem Without an End" which included a Christmas poem I had written that lent itself to being added to. I was amazed by the response as at that stage I only had a few followers here. People wrote a stanza of poetry each in "comments" on the hub to follow on from the previous commenter's stanza. It worked out very well and at the end I compiled all the contributions into a single poem as part of the hub.<br/><br/>Similar challenges have been issued since, including one by Frank Atanacio called "Spirits Sat as Mourners" that was also very successful. The difference being that in that instance contributors wrote their own hubs for their stanza of poetry and placed a link on Frank's original hub.<br/><br/>For this particular challenge I don't expect everyone to spend valuable time writing separate hubs for one stanza of poetry (unless you really want to). The main problem being that to make it effective you would have to copy the previously written parts of the poem onto your hub and would probably be hit with "duplication" label.<br/><br/>So, that being the case, and also to save having to leave links everywhere, I just ask that anyone who wants to take part just write their stanza here in "comments." Check the last comment before yours that is contributing to the challenge and follow on. If I see more than one following from the same stanza I will use my poetic licence to work them in as I deem best.<br/><br/>At some stage when I feel there has been enough stanzas added I will probably call an end to the challenge and then compile them all together as the completed poem as part of the article (also giving credit to each contributor).<br/><br/>Flowered Riverbank, Argenteuil<br/><br/>Claude Monet [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>The Challenge!<br/><br/>Now comes the interesting part. If you join this chain poetry challenge you have to try to keep the style and voice of the poem as close as possible to the preceding verses, so that to uninformed readers it will appear that only one author has written the entire poem.<br/><br/>Sounds easy, you say? Well maybe it would be if the poem had a traditional style, rhyme or meter. But this one doesn't! The poem you will be adding to was started by an acquaintance of mine Andriealphus as a "chain poem challenge" elsewhere. At the time of writing I was the only other person who had accepted the challenge, and because I loved the subject I thought it would be a great challenge for my fellow writers and decided to use it here and see if the response would be better. (I know of a few poets here whose writing would suit this style)<br/><br/>Rules :<br/><br/>Follow on from the previous stanza in comments<br/><br/>Try to retain the voice and style of the poem<br/><br/>Keep your stanza/verse to approximately the same length as those before<br/><br/>Claude Monet was one of the most famous painters in the history of art and a leading figure in the Impressionist movement.<br/><br/>In 1883 Monet moved to Giverny. Here, he loved to paint outdoors in the gardens that he helped create. The water lilies found in the pond had a particular appeal, and he painted several series of them throughout the rest of his life; the Japanese-style bridge over the pond became the subject of several works, as well.<br/><br/>In 1912 Monet painted a series of 12 waterlily paintings commissioned by the Orangerie des Tuileries, a museum in Paris. He chose to make them on a very large scale, and to serve as a "haven of peaceful meditation." This project consumed much of Monet's later years. Monet once stated, "These landscapes of water and reflection have become an obsession for me. It is beyond my strength as an old man, and yet I want to render what I feel."<br/><br/>His health was now an obstacle, as well. Nearly blind, with both of his eyes seriously affected by cataracts, Monet finally agreed to undergo surgery for the ailment in 1923.<br/><br/>Monet's famous water lilies turned redder as his cataracts progressed. After getting corrective surgery he destroyed most of the "red lily" paintings, angry that no one really mentioned it to him. Ironically, these paintings were probably what made his impressionistic style so famous in that time -- artists started taking more risks with color and such during this point. (source: biography.com)<br/><br/>The Masterpiece<br/><br/>"The boy sitting behind you says you look like a masterpiece.<br/><br/>Ask him, has he ever seen a Monet up close?<br/><br/>Close enough to see nothing but muddled strokes of weedy lakeshore?<br/><br/>Close enough to dip his fingers into the ridges<br/><br/>where oil paints hardened under an artist's gaze?<br/><br/>Close enough to breathe onto the blood lilies?<br/><br/>Ask him, why did he paint them red?" (Andriealphus)<br/><br/>He grinned like Carroll's cheshire cat.<br/><br/>"Through clouded and bloodshot eyes I imagine.<br/><br/>Be my waterlilies!" he says,<br/><br/>"Feel my breath and let my fingers delve,<br/><br/>become my masterpiece instead.<br/><br/>A brush has never touched a canvas as fine as your fair skin.<br/><br/>Let the masters weep in jealousy,<br/><br/>and Van Gogh slice his ear in envy at the beauty of your nakedness."(Jodah)<br/><br/>Self portrait with bandaged ear<br/><br/>Vincent van Gogh [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>Responses<br/><br/>Now it's your turn. Please write your response in the comments below, remembering to check those immediately before yours for the last written stanza of the poem. If you do decide to write a separate hub for your stanza of verse, make sure you leave a link here in comments.<br/><br/>The Finished Masterpiece<br/><br/>All contributions have been received and I have put the finished poem together with only some slight edits. I hope everyone is happy with the result. If you think I could improve the order of stanzas etc, feel free to let me know.<br/><br/>Comments<br/><br/>Hey Diana, looks like I have to go add another stanza to the finished poem :)<br/><br/>Thanks for this contribution.Quite beautiful.<br/><br/>Diana L Pierce from Potter County, Pa. on September 19, 2015:<br/><br/>No tears splash water below,<br/><br/>From the bridge beneath his feet,<br/><br/>Nor can his brush paint his thoughts,<br/><br/>From the mystery maid he seeks.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 21, 2015:<br/><br/>Thank you Cris, I am sure everyone appreciates your comment.

And the beauty we can still enjoy today from all his work.<br/><br/>This is a great challenge! I am really looking forward to adding to this.<br/><br/>I first wanted to stop in and let you know that, up for sure. Shared too.<br/><br/>And thank you so much for all the challenges to help the rest of us, keep our mental energy flowing and giving it a work out! You are the best.<br/><br/>The information about LuLu and the free ISBN number is an answered prayer! So, smile my friend. You are a gift!<br/><br/>Hugs. :-)<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 12, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi again Marj. I think I may have all the verses that are going to come. I have been doing my best to arrange them as I think best with just a little editing. I will probably post the finished poem as a separate hub with a link on this one to it. My book is available on Lulu and iBooks...there's a link on one of the earlier comments. I'd really appreciate it if you were to purhase a copy. Bear in mind it's my first eBook so the formatting etc isn't perfect, but it's taken me seven revisions I think to get it where it is. It will all be easier next time. If you need help let me know.<br/><br/>travmaj from australia on August 12, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi John, you have certainly had some excellent responses to your challenge - I'm sure you'll fuse it altogether beautifully although I imagine a difficult task. I'm interested in your poetry books also - I really have to get my act together technologically - I'll try and check it all out...cheers -<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi Jo, both books 'On the Wings of Eagles" and "I Laughed a Smile" have mostly the same content...except the former has one extra poem. Originally they were in different formats, one ePub, the other PDF but now they are both ePub. They are available through Lulu and iBooks, soon Barnes and Noble and Nook (not Amazon). I may try publishing another book through Amazon soon just to see how it compares. Thanks again.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>John, thanks a lot, the info on publishing with Lulu will be quite useful as I'm thinking of publishing but I'm currently torn between Amazon and Lulu. I wanted to purchase one of your books, but I couldn't seem to find them on Amazon. However, I'll probably get it from Lulu. Wishing you every success, you deserve it.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Hey Phyllis, thanks for ontributing. I like it, a perfect ending to the poem I think.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks Faith.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi Jo, I think I have sorted out the poem satisfactorily. Just waiting to see if there is any more to add. Publishing with Lulu wasn't bad and now that I've done it once it will be easier next time. Getting the formatting to look right in the eBook was the hardest, though you and just type it in a word document and Lulu automatically produces the contents page and converts the document to ePub or PDF you can only use certain fonts and have to make sure the chapter names or poem titles are in Heading 1. They also provide a free ISBN number if you want. Overall it was easier than expected however.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Phyllis, this is succinct and beautiful, I love it. Shyron's did an excellent job also, I thought I'd already commented on her verse, but I hadn't.<br/><br/>Phyllis Doyle Burns from High desert of Nevada. on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Wonderful hub, great idea, Jodah. Here is one from me. Short but sweet. Hope it is okay:<br/><br/>And this the beauty be<br/><br/>From Masters past we see<br/><br/>Impressed upon the boy<br/><br/>Bestowed on her with joy<br/><br/>Faith Reaper from southern USA on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks John and Jo. You are kind. Jo, you have always been a brilliant poet. I, too, am looking forward to the end result after John does his magic to pull it all together.<br/><br/>I will share again to see if there are any more takers.<br/><br/>Blessings<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Faith, beautifully done, I find it incredible how someone with such limited vision can teach us so much about beauty, light and shadows. John, looking forward to reading the end result.<br/><br/>By the way, congtats on publishing your poems. How did you find the process of publishing with Lulu?<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks for your great submission Faith. No it's not too late, I'm still compiling the final poem so it should be up for all to see in a day or two.<br/><br/>Faith Reaper from southern USA on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi John,<br/><br/>I apologize for my late submission here to your wonderful challenge. I am off from work a couple of day and decided to give this a go while my husband is resting from knee surgery. If it does not meet with your standards, please feel free to not use it in your final poem or edit as you deem necessary.<br/><br/>Blessings always<br/><br/>Here it goes:<br/><br/>Confessions to friend Georges Clemenceau<br/><br/>Of light encapsulating both torment, joy<br/><br/>Fervent madness in analyzing colors<br/><br/>Consequential spontaneous creations<br/><br/>Season after season of obsession<br/><br/>Capturing different hues in a single moment<br/><br/>Attentive while strolling in Argenteuill<br/><br/>Brushwork bares masterpiece.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 09, 2015:<br/><br/>Just a shout out to see if anyone else still wants to contribute to this chain poem. I have started compiling the stanzas together but will leave it open for a couple more days in case anyone else is intending to join in. Thanks to all who have contributed.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 02, 2015:<br/><br/>Thank you Genna. It appears Monet is a favourite arist of many here. I hope you'll take part in this challenge too :)<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 02, 2015:<br/><br/>Thank you for a great contribution Shyron. This is a very nice verse. Well done.<br/><br/>Genna East from Massachusetts, USA on August 02, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi John...<br/><br/>I started to read this wonderful challenge (Monet is one of my favorite artists), then came back to finish reading some of the beautiful contributions that give this painting a stunning voice through perception and the senses.

I'm so glad you like my contribution. This is a very good idea, I know you'll have fun putting it all together. Take care and my best to you.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks Deb, yes I am impressed by the standard of submissions. I'm looking forward to putting it all together.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Yes Ann, it is good to see the poets among us take up the challenge with some great contributions so far. I just hope Imcan do it justice when it comes to putting it together.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Well done Jo. The word "sublime" comes to mind. I hoped all the poets would rise to the fore, and they have. Love it, thanks for contributing.<br/><br/>Deb Hirt from Stillwater, OK on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>I am excited to see what you end up with here. There are a number of fine poets rising to the challenge, so go to it!<br/><br/>Ann Carr from SW England on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Great one, Jo!<br/><br/>You've got everyone going, John! Rather you than me, putting all this together, but it's going to be a humdinger of a poem when it finally comes to an end - if it ever does! You've really started something.<br/><br/>Ann<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Ok, John here goes nothing! Following from Kim's. I hope it reads well.<br/><br/>And the boy began to walk away<br/><br/>But in his wake, I heard him say<br/><br/>"I took a trip to Orangerie<br/><br/>Where the ghost of Monet still abides<br/><br/>I sat right down and gazed awhile<br/><br/>Until I heard a soft voice cry.<br/><br/>"Have you ever seen a fluid dream?<br/><br/>Where light evolves into what it touch<br/><br/>Where serenity flows through cloudy veil<br/><br/>Where the magician's brush like lightening rush<br/><br/>Have you ever seen a sight sublime?<br/><br/>A child born of distorted illusion<br/><br/>This flowering pond that traps the light<br/><br/>That lift the heart and beckons the soul<br/><br/>An abstract pulchritude up close<br/><br/>Move back, behold; such tranquil delight."<br/><br/>I hope this is in line with what the others have done. Feel free to edit if needed. My best...<br/><br/>Jo.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Alrighty!<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Yes Jo, please do. Anyone is welcome to do more than one stanza. I may add another myself at some stage.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>John, I've decided to have a go, but it's about 16 lines, can I do it in two stanzas following on from Kim's wonderful submission? You can always edit it later.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on July 31, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi Jo, sorry to hear you are under the weather at the moment. I am not in a hurry to close this challenge so I'll keep it open until you are back firing on all cylinders and are able to contribute. You are one of the hubbers I was looking forward to getting a response from as I thought it would suit. Thank you for your kind words, and get well soon.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on July 31, 2015:<br/><br/>Wow! John I can't believe I almost missed your incredible challenged. This is something in which I would have loved to participate since Claude Monet is one of my all times favourite artist. Unfortunately, I must cry off. I'm a bit under the weather with a head full of cotton wool, or so it seems. If the challenge is still open when I get rid of this pesky flu I may give it a go, but I must say, the standard is exceptionally high. Maj took it to another level but all the submissions are brilliant. Kudos to you Andriealphus and the other writers who participated so far in this artistic and creative masterpiece.<br/><br/>My best always Jo.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on July 31, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi again Maj, glad this poem inspired you, and yes it beats watching the cricket especially with the Aussie batsmen performing badly in this third test. It will be an interesting exercise for me to fuse all the stanzas together but should be good.<br/><br/>travmaj from australia on July 30, 2015:<br/><br/>John, thank you, I'm most happy you like my offering. I found the poem intriguing and suddenly felt inspired to write my version in the same mode. I'm not sure I wrote a continuation from the stanza before (alwaysexploring) but I'm sure you will fuse it altogether when the time comes. Love all the responses. I haven't managed any creative writing for yonks, can't wait now to start over, just need some time. (beats watching the cricket too!!!) Cheers John, will be checking in -<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on July 30, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks for checking Dana. I am pleased with the quality of responses so far. I just have to wait and see how many more come in. The final,poem should be great.<br/><br/>Dana Tate from LOS ANGELES on July 30, 2015:<br/><br/>Just checking in to see how things are going, I can't wait for the finished product.

Hovudføremålet med denne typen poesi er å skape dikt gjennom samarbeid mellom ulike forfattarar/diktarar, og forsøke å danne ei samla stemme samtidig som dei opprettheld sine individuelle stemmer.<br/><br/>Det finst mange døme på samarbeid i japansk poesi, men dei nøyaktige forteljingane og nedteikningane av mange slike hendingar er anten tapt eller mangla.<br/><br/>Eit av dei mest kjende døma på kollektiv poesiskriving var diktsamlinga Ralentir Travaux av dei surrealistiske franske diktarane André Breton, Paul Éluard og René Char. Desse tre diktarane samarbeidde om å skrive dikta i denne samlinga over berre fem dagar i 1930.<br/><br/>I løpet av 1940-åra fann den amerikanske diktaren Charles Henri Ford opp det han kalla «kjedediktet», der kvar diktar skreiv ei linje og deretter sende diktet til ein annan person (for å halde fram) i ein annan del av verda, per post.<br/><br/>I 2007 vart ei samling av amerikanske samarbeidsdikt Saints of Hysteria: A Half-Century of Collaborative American Poetry redigert og publisert av Denise Duhamel, Maureen Seaton og David Trinidad.<br/><br/>Samarbeidsdikting har vorte brukt i skular og høgskular for å lære elevane lagarbeid og for å oppdaga korleis dei er knytt saman.(kilde: Wikipedia)<br/><br/>Study of a Figure Outdoors: Kvinne med parasoll, mot venstre, 1886<br/><br/>Claude Monet [Public domain eller Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>Målet med denne artikkelen og korleis ein kan kome fram til utfordringa<br/><br/>For nokre år sidan skreiv eg ein artikkel kalla «Poem Without an End», som inkluderte eit juledikt eg hadde skrive som eg lånte sjølv til å bli tilsett til. Eg vart forbløffa over responsen sidan eg på det stadiet berre hadde nokre få tilhengjarar her. Folk skreiv ein strofe av poesi kvar i "kommentarar" på huben for å følgje opp frå den tidlegare kommentatoren sin strofe. Det fungerte veldig bra og til slutt samla eg alle bidraga i eit enkelt dikt som ein del av huben.<br/><br/>Liknande utfordringar har vorte gjevne ut sidan, mellom anna ein av Frank Atanacio kalla «Spirits Sat as Mourners» som òg var svært suksessrik. Skilnaden er at bidragsytarane i dette tilfellet skreiv sine eigne knutepunkt for poesien sin og plasserte ei lenkje på det opphavlege knutepunktet til Frank.<br/><br/>For denne spesielle utfordringa forventar eg ikkje at alle skal bruke verdifull tid på å skrive eigne knutepunkt for eitt dikt (med mindre du verkeleg vil). Hovudproblemet er at for å gjere det effektivt måtte ein kopiere dei tidlegare skrivne delane av diktet inn på navet og truleg bli slått med «duplikerings»-etiketten.<br/><br/>Så, dersom det er tilfelle, og også for å spare deg for å måtte forlate lenker overalt, ber eg bare om at alle som ønsker å delta, bare skriv sin strofe her i "kommentarer". Sjekk den siste kommentaren før din som bidrar til utfordringen og følg med. Ser eg meir enn ein tilhengjar frå same strofe, vil eg bruke min poetiske lisens til å arbeide med dei som eg synest er best.<br/><br/>På eit tidspunkt når eg føler det har vore nok strofer lagt til, vil eg truleg kalle ein slutt på utfordringa og så kompilere dei alle saman som det ferdige diktet som ein del av artikkelen (også gi kreditt til kvar bidragsytar).<br/><br/>Blomstra elvebreidd, Argenteuil<br/><br/>Claude Monet [Offentlig domene], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>Utfordringa!<br/><br/>No kjem den interessante delen. Dersom ein tek del i denne kjedediktingsutfordringa må ein prøve å halde stilen og stemma i diktet så nær dei føregåande versa som mogleg, slik at det for uinformerte lesarar vil syne seg at berre ein forfattar har skrive heile diktet.<br/><br/>Lydar enkelt, seier du? Vel kanskje det ville vore om diktet hadde ein tradisjonell stil, rim eller målar. Men dette gjer det ikkje! Diktet du skal legge til vart starta av ein kjenning av min Andriealphus som ein "kjedediktutfordring" andre stader. I skrivende stund var eg den einaste andre som hadde teke imot utfordringa, og fordi eg likte emnet tenkte eg at det ville vere ei stor utfordring for medforfattarane mine og bestemte meg for å bruke det her og sjå om svaret ville bli betre. (Eg kjenner til nokre få diktarar her som ville skrive denne stilen)<br/><br/>Reglar:<br/><br/>Følg opp frå førre strofe i kommentarar<br/><br/>Prøv å behalda stemma og stilen i diktet<br/><br/>Hald strofen/verset til omtrent same lengd som før<br/><br/>Claude Monet var ein av dei mest kjende målarane i kunsthistoria og ein leiande figur i den impresjonistiske rørsla.<br/><br/>I 1883 flytta Monet til Giverny, der han var glad i å måla utandørs i hagar som han var med på å laga. Vassliljene som vart funne i dammen hadde ein særleg appell, og han måla fleire serier av dei gjennom resten av livet; brua i japansk stil over dammen vart òg gjenstand for fleire verk.<br/><br/>I 1912 måla Monet 12 vassliljemåleri på oppdrag frå Orangerie des Tuileries, eit museum i Paris. Han valde å lage dei i stor skala, og å fungere som ein «havn for fredeleg meditasjon». Dette prosjektet tok mykje av dei seinare åra til Monet. Monet sa ein gong: "Disse landskapa av vatn og refleksjon har blitt ein besettelse for meg. Det er utover min styrke som ein gamal mann, og likevel vil eg gjengi det eg føler."<br/><br/>Heilen hans var no òg eit hinder, og Monet gjekk til slutt med på å bli operert for sjukdomen i 1923, nesten blind, med begge augo alvorleg påverka av grå stær.<br/><br/>Monets kjende vannliljer vart raudare etter kvart som grå stær utvikla seg, og etter å ha fått korreksjonskirurgi, øydela han dei fleste av dei «raudlilje»-måleria, sinte over at ingen verkeleg hadde nemnt det for han. Ironisk nok var desse måleria truleg det som gjorde hans impresjonistiske stil så berømt på den tida -- kunstnarar byrja å ta meir risiko med farge og slikt i løpet av dette punktet. (kilde: biography.com)<br/><br/>Hovudverket<br/><br/>«Gutten som sit bak deg seier at du ser ut som eit mesterverk.<br/><br/>Spør han, har han nokon gong sett ein Monet på nært hald?<br/><br/>Nært nok til å ikkje sjå anna enn forvirra strøk av ugrasaktige innsjøar?<br/><br/>Nær nok til å dyppa fingrane i ryggane<br/><br/>Korleis kan oljemaling forherdast under eit bilete av kunstnarar?<br/><br/>Nær nok til å puste på blodliljene?<br/><br/>Spør han, kvifor måla han dei raude?» (Andriealphus)<br/><br/>Han smilte som Carroll sin cheshire-katt.<br/><br/>«Gjennom skya og blodskutte auge tenkjer eg.<br/><br/>Vær mine vannliljer!" seier han,<br/><br/>"Føl pusten min og la fingrene mine dykke,<br/><br/>bli mitt meisterverk i staden.<br/><br/>Ein pensel har aldri rørt eit lerret så fint som den lyse huda di.<br/><br/>misunning, fyll, festing og meir av det slaget.<br/><br/>og Van Gogh skar øyra hans i misunnelse over den vakre nakenleiken din.» (Jodah)<br/><br/>Sjølvportrett med bandasjert øyre<br/><br/>Vincent van Gogh[endre endre wikiteksten]<br/><br/>Svar<br/><br/>No er det din tur.

Viss du bestemmer deg for å skrive eit eige knutepunkt for verset ditt, sørg for at du legg igjen ein link her i kommentarane.<br/><br/>Det ferdige meisterverket<br/><br/>Alle bidraga er mottekne, og eg har lagt det ferdige diktet saman med berre nokre små endringar.

Fantastisk jobb. Bra jobba, alle fantastiske kreative folk der ute.<br/><br/>John Hansen (forfattar) frå Gondwana Land 14. august 2015:<br/><br/>Alt ferdig, sjekk det ut. (Sjå lenkja over kommentarar)<br/><br/>John Hansen (forfattar) frå Gondwana Land 14. august 2015:<br/><br/>Hei Jo, veldig godt gjort. Takk for at du er med :) Stanzaen din fortel ei flott historie med få ord.

Så smil, min venn. Du er ei gåve!<br/><br/>Hugs. :-)<br/><br/>John Hansen (forfattar) frå Gondwana Land 12. august 2015:<br/><br/>Hei igjen Marj. Eg trur eg har alle versa som skal koma. Eg har gjort mitt beste for å ordne dei slik eg synest er best med berre litt redigering. Eg vil truleg poste det ferdige diktet som eit eige knutepunkt med ein link på denne til det. Boka mi er tilgjengeleg på Lulu og iBooks...det er ei lenkje på ein av dei tidlegare kommentarane. Eg vil verkeleg sette pris på det om du kjøper eit eksemplar. Husk at dette er den første e-boka mi, så formateringa osv. er ikkje perfekt, men det har teke meg sju revisjonar trur eg for å få det dit det er. Det blir lettare neste gong. Om du treng hjelp, gi beskjed.<br/><br/>travmaj frå Australia 12. august 2015:<br/><br/>Hei John, du har sikkert fått nokre gode svar på utfordringa di - eg er sikker på at du vil smelte det heilt vakkert sjølv om eg forestiller meg ei vanskeleg oppgåve. Eg er òg interessert i poesibøkene dine - eg må verkeleg få saman handlinga mi teknologisk - eg skal prøve å sjekke det ut... hurrarop -<br/><br/>John Hansen (forfattar) frå Gondwana Land 11. august 2015:<br/><br/>Hi Jo, begge bøkene 'On the Wings of Eagles' og «I Laughed a Smile» har stort sett same innhald...bortsett frå at det førstnemnde har eit ekstra dikt. Opphavleg var dei i ulike format, ein ePub, den andre PDF, men no er dei begge ePub. Dei er tilgjengelege gjennom Lulu og iBooks, snart Barnes and Noble and Nook (ikkje Amazon). Eg kan prøva å gje ut ei anna bok gjennom Amazon snart berre for å sjå korleis det samanliknar. Takk igjen.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues frå Lincolnshire i Storbritannia 11. august 2015:<br/><br/>John, takk så mykje, informasjonen om utgjeving med Lulu vil vere ganske nyttig som eg tenker på å publisere, men eg er for tida revet mellom Amazon og Lulu. Eg ville kjøpe ein av bøkene dine, men eg kunne ikkje synest å finne dei på Amazon. Men eg vil truleg få det frå Lulu. Eg ønskjer deg all suksess, du fortjener det.<br/><br/>John Hansen (forfattar) frå Gondwana Land 11. august 2015:<br/><br/>Hei Phyllis, takk for påskrivinga. Eg likar det, ein perfekt avslutning på diktet eg trur.<br/><br/>John Hansen (forfattar) frå Gondwana Land 11. august 2015:<br/><br/>Takk skal du ha, Faith.<br/><br/>John Hansen (forfattar) frå Gondwana Land 11. august 2015:<br/><br/>Hei Jo, eg trur eg har sortert ut diktet tilfredsstillende. Ventar berre på å sjå om det er meir å leggje til. Publisering med Lulu var ikkje dårleg og no når eg har gjort det ein gong blir det lettare neste gong. Å få formateringa til å sjå rett ut i e-boka var det vanskelegaste, sjølv om du og berre skriv det inn i eit orddokument og Lulu automatisk lagar innhaldssida og konverterer dokumentet til ePub eller PDF kan ein berre bruke visse skrifttypar og må sjå til at kapittelnamna eller dikttitlane er i overskrift 1. Dei tilbyr òg eit gratis ISBN-nummer om du ynskjer det, men alt i alt var det lettare enn venta.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues frå Lincolnshire i Storbritannia 11. august 2015:<br/><br/>Phyllis, dette er kortfatta og vakkert, eg elskar det. Shyron's gjorde ein utmerket jobb òg, eg trudde eg alt hadde kommentert verset hennar, men det hadde eg ikkje.<br/><br/>Phyllis Doyle Burns frå High Desert i Nevada. 10. august 2015:<br/><br/>Flott knutepunkt, flott idé, Jodah. Her er ein frå meg. Kort, men søtt.

Korleis fann du prosessen med å publisere med Lulu?<br/><br/>John Hansen (forfattar) frå Gondwana Land 10. august 2015:<br/><br/>Nei, det er ikkje for seint, eg er framleis i gang med å kompilere det endelege diktet, så det burde vere opp til alle å sjå i løpet av ein dag eller to.<br/><br/>Faith Reaper frå Sør-USA 10. august 2015:<br/><br/>Hallo, John.<br/><br/>Eg er lei meg for den seine innsendinga mi til den fantastiske utfordringa di. Eg har hatt fri frå jobb eit par dagar og har bestemt meg for å gje dette ein sjanse medan mannen min kviler etter kneoperasjonen. Dersom det ikkje oppfyller standardane dine, kan du gjerne ikkje bruke det i det endelege diktet ditt eller redigere det etter behov.<br/><br/>Velsigna alltid<br/><br/>Her går det føre seg:<br/><br/>Tilståelser til venen Georges Clemenceau<br/><br/>Av lys som omsluttar både pine, glede<br/><br/>Galskap i analysen av fargane<br/><br/>Følgjelege spontane skapingar<br/><br/>Sesong etter sesong av besettelse<br/><br/>Fange ulike fargetoner i eitt augneblink<br/><br/>Ver merksam medan du spaserer i Argenteuil<br/><br/>Penselstøp bar meisterverk.<br/><br/>John Hansen (forfattar) frå Gondwana Land 9. august 2015:<br/><br/>Berre eit rop for å sjå om det er nokon andre som vil bidra til dette kjedediktet. Eg har byrja å kompilere strofene saman, men vil la det stå ope eit par dagar til i tilfelle nokon andre har tenkt å bli med. Takk til alle som har bidratt.<br/><br/>John Hansen (forfattar) frå Gondwana Land 2. august 2015:<br/><br/>Takk Genna. Det ser ut til at Monet er ein favoritt av mange her. Eg håpar du vil ta del i denne utfordringa òg :)<br/><br/>John Hansen (forfattar) frå Gondwana Land 2. august 2015:<br/><br/>Takk for eit flott bidrag Shyron. Dette er eit veldig fint vers. Godt gjort.<br/><br/>Genna East frå Massachusetts i USA den 2. august 2015:<br/><br/>Hei, John.<br/><br/>Eg byrja å lese denne fantastiske utfordringa (Monet er ein av favorittartistane mine), så kom eg tilbake for å lese ferdig nokre av dei vakre bidraga som gir dette maleriet ei fantastisk stemme gjennom persepsjon og sansar.<br/><br/>Shyron E Shenko frå Texas 2. august 2015:<br/><br/>Etter Jo (tobusiness)<br/><br/>"Den reine kvite av liljeskinnet<br/><br/>Snakkar om ingen skjønnhet innanfrå<br/><br/>Berre Monet sin veg eller mål<br/><br/>For festande auge<br/><br/>Ikkje fest for sjela»<br/><br/>Shyron<br/><br/>John Hansen (forfattar) frå Gondwana Land 2. august 2015:<br/><br/>Takk for at du kom tilbake Kim, eg er så glad for svara. Bare gav å vente og se om det er fleire.<br/><br/>ocfireflies frå Nord-Carolina 2. august 2015:<br/><br/>John,<br/><br/>Så glad kvar gong eg kjem attende for å sjå eit anna ledd i denne poetiske kjeden, og Wow, gjer Jo det nokon gong rett.<br/><br/>Kim<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues frå Lincolnshire i Storbritannia den 2. august 2015:<br/><br/>Eg er så glad for at du likar innlegget mitt. Dette er eit veldig godt innlegg. Eg veit at du vil ha det moro med å setje det saman. Pass på deg sjølv og mitt beste.<br/><br/>John Hansen (forfattar) frå Gondwana Land den 1. august 2015:<br/><br/>Takk Deb, ja eg er imponert over standarden på innsendingar. Eg ser fram til å setje det saman.<br/><br/>John Hansen (forfattar) frå Gondwana Land den 1. august 2015:<br/><br/>Ja Ann, det er godt å sjå diktarane blant oss ta opp utfordringa med nokre store bidrag så langt. Jeg håper bare Imcan gjør det rettferdig når det gjelder å sette det sammen.<br/><br/>John Hansen (forfattar) frå Gondwana Land den 1. august 2015:<br/><br/>Med rette tenkjer eg slik om dykk alle, for eg håpar at dei skal koma til kort. For eg elskar dykk og vil takka dykk for alt de har skrive.<br/><br/>Deb Hirt frå Stillwater, OK den 1. august 2015:<br/><br/>Difor er det eg ønskjer å fortelja dykk kva de står for. For det finst mange dyktige diktarar som reiser seg og gjer dette.<br/><br/>Ann Carr frå SW England den 1. august 2015:<br/><br/>Flott, Jo!<br/><br/>Du har alle gå, John! Heller du enn meg, sette alt dette sammen, men det kommer til å være en humding av et dikt når det endelig kommer til en slutt - hvis det noen gang gjør! Du har virkelig startet noe.<br/><br/>Ann<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues frå Lincolnshire i Storbritannia 1. august 2015:<br/><br/>Ok, John here goes nothing! Følger etter Kim. Håpar det les godt.<br/><br/>Og guten tok til å gå frå han.<br/><br/>Men i kjølvatnet hans høyrde eg han sa<br/><br/>«Eg tok ein tur til Orangerie<br/><br/>Der spøkelset til Monet enno bur<br/><br/>Eg sette meg ned og stirra ei stund<br/><br/>Til eg høyrde ei mjuk røyst som ropa.<br/><br/>«Har du nokon gong sett ein flytande draum?<br/><br/>Der lyset utviklar seg til det det rører ved<br/><br/>Der roen strøymer gjennom skya slør<br/><br/>Der tryllekunstnaren krinsar som lyn<br/><br/>Har du nokon gong sett eit syn som er sublimt?<br/><br/>Eit barn fødd av forvrengt illusjon<br/><br/>Denne blomsterdammen som fangar lyset<br/><br/>Det løfter hjartet og vinker til sjela<br/><br/>Ein abstrakt pulchritude på nært hald<br/><br/>Gå tilbake, sjå; slik roleg glede.»<br/><br/>Eg håpar dette er i tråd med det dei andre har gjort. Gjerne rediger om nødvendig. Mitt beste...<br/><br/>Jo.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues frå Lincolnshire i Storbritannia 1. august 2015:<br/><br/>Ja vel!<br/><br/>John Hansen (forfattar) frå Gondwana Land den 1. august 2015:<br/><br/>Ja, eg har sagt det før. Om nokon vil gjera det, skal han seia det på ein annan måte.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues frå Lincolnshire i Storbritannia 1. august 2015:<br/><br/>John, eg har bestemt meg for å ta ein tur, men det er om lag 16 linjer, kan eg gjere det i to strofer etter Kim sin fantastiske innsending? Du kan alltids redigere det seinare.<br/><br/>John Hansen (forfattar) frå Gondwana Land 31. juli 2015:<br/><br/>Hei Jo, sorry for at du er under vêret akkurat no. Eg har ikkje hastverk med å lukka denne utfordringa, så eg held det ope til du er tilbake på alle sylindrar og kan bidra. Du er ein av dei som eg såg fram til å få svar frå, som eg trudde ville passa. Takk for dine snille ord, og bli frisk snart.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues frå Lincolnshire i Storbritannia 31. juli 2015:<br/><br/>Wow! John Eg kan ikkje tru at eg nesten gjekk glipp av den utrulege utfordringa di. Dette er noko eg ville ha likt å delta på sidan Claude Monet er ein av favorittartistane mine gjennom tidene. Eg må dessverre gråte av meg. Eg er litt under vêret med hovudet fullt av bomullsull, ser det ut til. Om utfordringa framleis er open når eg vert kvitt denne irriterende influensaen kan eg gi det eit forsøk, men eg må seie at standarden er eksepsjonelt høg. Maj tok det til eit anna nivå, men alle innleveringane er briljante. Kudos til deg Andriealphus og dei andre forfattarane som har vore med så langt i dette kunstnariske og kreative meisterverket.<br/><br/>Mitt beste alltid Jo.<br/><br/>John Hansen (forfattar) frå Gondwana Land 31. juli 2015:<br/><br/>Hei igjen Maj, glad for at dette diktet inspirerte deg, og ja det slår å sjå på cricket spesielt med dei austerrikske slagmennene som presterer dårleg i denne tredje testen. Det vil vere ei interessant øving for meg å smelte alle strofene saman, men det burde vere bra.<br/><br/>travmaj frå Australia 30. juli 2015:<br/><br/>John, takk, eg er mest glad for at du likar offeret mitt. Eg fann diktet spennande og følte meg plutseleg inspirert til å skrive versjonen min i same modus. Eg er ikkje sikker på at eg skreiv ein fortsettelse frå strofa før (alltid utforsking), men eg er sikker på at du vil smelte det heilt saman når den tida kjem. Eg har ikkje klart noko kreativ skriving for yonks, kan ikkje vente med å starte på nytt, treng berre litt tid. (slår og ser på cricket også!!!)<br/><br/>John Hansen (forfattar) frå Gondwana Land 30. juli 2015:<br/><br/>Takk for at du sjekka Dana. Eg er nøgd med kvaliteten på svara så langt. Eg må berre vente og sjå kor mange fleire som kjem inn. Den siste, diktet skal vere flott.<br/><br/>Dana Tate frå LOS ANGELES 30. juli 2015:<br/><br/>Eg gleda meg til å sjå korleis det går med det ferdige produktet. Eg gjekk på eit diktkurs og me gjorde dette òg, det var veldig morosamt.<br/><br/>ocfireflies frå Nord-Carolina 29. juli 2015:<br/><br/>John,<br/><br/>Takk så mykje for å gje plattforma for utan at det er lett å falle ned.<br/><br/>; ) Kim<br/><br/>John Hansen (forfattar) frå Gondwana Land 29. juli 2015:<br/><br/>Takk Devika, eg har ikkje sett deg på ei stund, håper alt er bra.<br/><br/>John Hansen (forfattar) frå Gondwana Land 29. juli 2015:<br/><br/>Flott arbeid Kim. Det vil følgje perfekt frå Maj's som du svarte på GIverny-spørsmålet. Eg er så nøgd med kvaliteten på svara så langt.<br/><br/>ocfireflies frå Nord-Carolina 29. juli 2015:<br/><br/>John,<br/><br/>Eg hadde sendt dette tidlegare før travmaj sitt kjempefine bidrag, men kanskje det framleis funkar (jeg gjorde litt justeringar)<br/><br/>etter i motsetnad til før -- veit ikkje om<br/><br/>Eg meiner det er meiningsfullt. Viss det ikkje fungerer, kan du gjerne sletta det, så skal eg prøve igjen. |

| First of all EEQT itself needs to be further developed in order to provide a theoretical and computational answer to the needs of modern quantum engineering<br/>and technology. We need to include classical systems with infinite<br/>numbers of degrees of freedom - like electromagnetic and/or gravitational<br/>field. We also need to include infinite quantum systems so as<br/>to understand and simulate Bose gas and its phase transitions. But, there<br/>are also steps that must be taken far beyond the paradigm of EEQT.<br/>As we have emphasized so many times: quantum theory has yet<br/>to be understood in terms of a "non-linear classical theory." But what we mean by a "classical theory" is something much more advanced and more<br/>general than clasical mechanics or classical field theory. By a "classical theory" we mean first of all, a theory that is not based<br/>on probabilities from the start; a theory in which probabilities appear at a<br/>later stage, derived from the theory; derived perhaps, in a necessary way. Such a theory must not only specify the mathematical objects and their relations but also make "predictions".<br/>A classical theory is, in particular, a theory in which discrete events can happen, events that are "objective." They may be events that affect mainly the physical stratum, but they may be also "mental<br/>events," changes of states of "consciousness;" whatever they are, even if they<br/>are concerned with branchings of universes, - they DO HAPPEN.<br/>Such a theory, encompassing the quantum theory as we know it today,<br/>does not yet exist, but we can envisage its possible shape. Nothing serves better than an example, so let us give here an example of how<br/>such a theory can be construed.<br/>Imagine a theory developed a'la Einstein's unified field theory, but<br/>with variable metric signature, possibly with a complex causal web, multiple<br/>Einstein-Rosen [40] (see also [41]) bridges,<br/>time loops, nondifferrentiability, fractal structure, all of that additionally complicated by variable dimensionality of space and of "time" (cf [42]. Imagine such a theory to be able to accomodate all the four fundamental<br/>forces known to us, but it also involves an extra field, which is different<br/>from physical fields, and which is non-local in the sense that it does not<br/>survive taking a macro-average-limit when causal space-time<br/>structure of Einstein's general relativity is recovered. This extra field<br/>would be a place for "thought forms" and our theory would couple these<br/>thought forms to more "physical" levels of reality. The very concept of<br/>"time" would arise only in one particular limiting structure. Nothing<br/>prevents a theory of such a type to have mathematical structures rich enough to accomodate consciousness and mind. Due to its complexity,<br/>density of time-loops, bubble-like causal structure, making predictions<br/>in such theory is possible only by applying probability -<br/>as it is the case with systems evolving according to deterministic<br/>but chaotic dynamics. Quantum wave function would emerge in such a<br/>theory as an effective way of predicting. That type of explanation<br/>of quantum indeterminism was postulated long ago by I. J. Good. In<br/>[3] he speculated that<br/>quantum indeterminism can be understood if we admit that individual quantum events that actually happen here and now have future<br/>advanced causes as well has past retarded causes.<br/>A glimpse of such a thought<br/>may have occured to Alan Turing when he wrote his famous, already quoted sentence: "prediction must be linear, description must be nonlinear."<br/>A theory going partially in this direction is being developed by L. Nottale<br/>[43] who states the observation, attributed to Feynman, that "the typical paths of quantum mechanical particles are continuous non-differentiable." Then he continues his development of fractal<br/>space-time ideas to conclude with: "The quantum behavior becomes, in this theory,<br/>a manifestation of the fractal geometry of space-time, in the same way gravitation is, in Einstein's theory of general (motion-)relativity, a manifestation of the curvature of space-time.<br/>Another step in this direction comes from the work of Russian scientists - which started with the most original ideas of N.A. Kozyrev [44]<br/>and A. Sakharov [45], and is being developed in Moscow, the Urals and Siberia, see e.g. [46, 47, 48]. | Først og fremst må sjølve EEQT vidareutviklast for å kunne gi eit teoretisk og utrekningsmessig svar på behova til moderne kvanteteknikk og -teknologi. Vi må ta med klassiske system med uendeleg mange fridomsgrader - som elektromagnetiske og/eller gravitasjonsfelt. Vi må også ta med uendelege kvantesystem for å forstå og simulere Bose-gass og faseovergangane. Men det er òg steg som må takast langt utover paradigmet til EEQT.<br/>Som vi har lagt vekt på så mange gonger: Kvanteteorien har enno ikkje blitt forstått i form av ein «ikke-lineær klassisk teori». Men det vi meiner med ein «klassisk teori» er noko langt meir avansert og meir generelt enn klassisk mekanikk eller klassisk feltteori. Med ein «klassisk teori» meiner vi først og fremst ein teori som ikkje er basert på sannsyn frå starten; ein teori der sannsyn opptrer på eit seinare stadium, avleidd frå teorien; avleidd kanskje, på ein naudsynt måte. Ein slik teori må ikkje berre spesifisera dei matematiske objekta og relasjonane deira, men òg lage «prediksjonar».<br/>Ein klassisk teori er særleg ein teori der diskrete hendingar kan skje, hendingar som er «objektive». Dei kan vera hendingar som hovudsakleg påverkar det fysiske laget, men dei kan òg vere «mentale hendingar», endringar i tilstandar av «bevisstheit»; kva enn dei er, sjølv om dei dreiar seg om forgreningar av univers, - så skjer dei.<br/>Ein slik teori, som omfattar kvanteteorien slik vi kjenner han i dag, finst enno ikkje, men vi kan sjå for oss ei mogleg form. Ingenting er betre enn eit døme, så la oss her gi eit eksempel på korleis ein slik teori kan tolkast.<br/>Tenk deg ein teori som utvikla a'la Einstein sin enhetlige feltteori, men med variabel metrisk signatur, moglegvis med eit komplekst kausalt vev, fleirtal<br/>Einstein-Rosen [40] (sjå òg [41]) bruer, tidssløyfer, ikkje-differensierbarhet, fraktalstruktur, alt dette i tillegg komplisert av variabel dimensjonalitet av rom og «tid» (jf. [42]. Tenk deg ein slik teori for å kunne imøtekomme alle dei fire fundamentale kreftene som er kjende for oss, men det inneber òg eit ekstra felt, som er forskjellig frå fysiske felt, og som er ikkje-lokalt i den forstand at det ikkje overlever å ta ei makro-gjennomsnittleg grense når kausal rom-tid-struktur i den generelle relativitetsteorien til Einstein vert gjenvunnen. Dette ekstra feltet ville vere ein stad for "tankeformer", og teorien vår ville kople desse tankeformene til meir "fysiske" nivå av røyndomen.<br/>«tid» ville berre oppstå i ein bestemt avgrensande struktur. Ingenting hindrar ein teori av ein slik type til å ha matematiske strukturar som er rike nok til å imøtekomme medvitet og sinnet. På grunn av kompleksiteten, tettleiken av tidssløyfer, bobleliknande kausalstruktur, er det berre mogleg å lage spådomar i ein slik teori ved å bruke sannsynsrekning.<br/>Kvantebølgjefunksjon er ein funksjon i kvanteteorien som ein kan bruke til å føresjå kva som skjer når ein har system som utviklar seg i samsvar med ein deterministisk, men kaotisk dynamikk. Den typen forklaring på kvante-indeterminisme vart postulert for lenge sidan av I. J. Good.<br/>[3] han spekulerte i at kvante-indeterminisme kan forståast viss me innrømmer at individuelle kvantehendingar som faktisk skjer her og no har framtidige avanserte årsaker òg har tidlegare tilbakeståande årsaker.<br/>Eit glimt av ein slik tanke kan ha oppstått for Alan Turing då han skreiv den kjende, allereie siterte setninga si: «forutsigelse må vera lineær, skildring må vera ikkje-lineær.»<br/>Ein teori som delvis går i denne retninga vert utvikla av L. Nottale<br/>[43] som seier observasjonen, tilskriven Feynman, at «de typiske banene til kvantemekaniske partiklar er kontinuerlege ikkje-differensierbare.» Deretter fortsette han utviklinga av fraktalromtid-idear for å konkludere med: «Kvanteåtferda blir i denne teorien ein manifestasjon av fraktalgeometrien til romtid, på same måte som gravitasjon er i Einsteins teori om generell (rørsle-)relativitet, ein manifestasjon av krumminga til romtid.<br/>Eit anna steg i denne retninga kjem frå arbeidet til russiske vitskapsmenn - som starta med dei mest originale ideane til N.A. Kozyrev [44]<br/>og A. Sakharov [45], og er under utvikling i Moskva, Uralfjella og Sibir, sjå t.d. [46, 47, 48]. |
| Best Nutrition And Exercise For Lose Weight<br/><br/>How is breakfast really healthy?<br/><br/>In the morning like an emperor, at noon like a king, in the evening like a beggar – goes a well-known proverb. A study by the medical organization Endocrine Society confirms the key message behind the saying: It shows that breakfast plays a more important role than is often assumed. In the morning, the human body actually has more than twice as high a metabolic activity as at other times of the day: A large breakfast not only keeps you full for a long time, blood sugar and insulin levels also rise slowly. The appetite for sweets is regulated, we eat snacks less often during the day. Therefore, breakfast should not be skipped even during a diet.<br/><br/>Of course, having a big breakfast doesn't mean that we should have several croissants with nut nougat cream and sweet breakfast pancakes in the morning. Breakfast is healthy best when it is high in protein and fiber, as well as providing vitamins and minerals. Whole grain bread or muesli, oat flakes, fruits and nuts are energy suppliers that are good for you and keep you full for a long time.<br/><br/>The fact that a large breakfast is better than a large dinner does not necessarily mean that breakfast is essential for losing weight. A meta-analysis carried out in 2019 showed, that the total daily energy intake of people who eat breakfast is on average higher, than that of those who do not have breakfast. The latter were on average just under half a kilo lighter. So, according to the results of this major study, you don't necessarily have to eat breakfast if you want to lose weight.<br/><br/>Lose weight with the right diet – that's how easy it is to put healthy on your plate<br/><br/>Eating healthy in no way means less taste. Fresh vegetables, fish or meat as protein sources and other healthy ingredients conjure up taste in the pot and a smile on your lips – ideally also when you step on the scales. A US study has shown that people who cook their own food and consciously deal with what they eat have a body mass index in the normal range. Restaurant visits or fast food, on the other hand, quickly lure you into the sugar trap: Often there is no indication of how much sugar is in salad dressings, how much fat the potatoes were fried in or whether the meat was not treated.<br/><br/>A healthy lunch consists of three parts – the largest part is fruits or vegetables and should cover half of the plate. A quarter of the meal should consist of protein, i.e. fish, meat or tofu. The remaining quarter consists of carbohydrates and is ideally made from whole grain products. Important: Don't eat at your desk in the office, but stimulate your metabolism and ideally take a short walk before or after lunch.<br/><br/>When should you eat to lose weight?<br/><br/>In the evening, you should focus on light meals that are rather low in carbohydrates. These are the least likely to cause insulin to skyrocket, which is good for our body. Vegetables, dairy products and nuts, for example, are well suited for this.<br/><br/>You should also be careful not to have dinner too late. It is best to have eaten until 7 p.m. – then the body can relax and prepare for the night. Sufficient sleep is important for healthy weight loss. A US study found that people who slept about eight hours a night had better fat deposits. So good night! Allow yourself more than six hours of sleep so that you can start the next day fit and refreshed.<br/><br/>Losing weight without exercise – is it really possible?<br/><br/>It would be so easy, if the dream weight could be achieved simply by lowering the calorie intake. But you probably know the wisdom that diet is only one side of the coin and exercise is the other. So nothing helps: Put on your sportswear and off you go!<br/><br/>Anyone who, in addition to the sports program such as jogging, walking or swimming, also lets the elevator go alone and takes the stairs, takes a little detour or uses the bike instead of the car, is doing wellis also called something good. Even simple walking is good for health. | Beste ernæring og mosjon for å gå ned i vekt<br/><br/>Korleis er frukost verkeleg sunt?<br/><br/>Om morgonen som ein keisar, midt på dagen som ein konge, om kvelden som ein tiggar - går det eit kjent ordtak. Ein studie av den medisinske organisasjonen Endocrine Society stadfestar nøkkelmeldinga bak ordtaket: Det viser at frukosten spelar ei viktigare rolle enn det ein ofte går ut frå. Om morgonen har menneskekroppen faktisk meir enn dobbelt så høg metabolsk aktivitet som på andre tider av døgnet: Ei stor frukost held deg ikkje berre mett lenge, blodsukkeret og insulinnivået stig òg sakte. Appetitten for søtsaker er regulert, me et snacks sjeldnare i løpet av dagen, og derfor bør ein ikkje hoppe over frukosten sjølv om ein er på diett.<br/><br/>Å ha ein stor frukost betyr sjølvsagt ikkje at me skal ha fleire croissanter med nøttenougatkrem og søte frukostpannekaker om morgonen. Frokosten er sunnast når den er rik på protein og fiber, i tillegg til vitamin og mineral. Heilkornsbrød eller müsli, havreflak, frukt og nøtter er energileverandørar som er gode for deg og held deg mett lenge.<br/><br/>At ein stor frukost er betre enn ein stor middag, betyr ikkje nødvendigvis at frukost er vesentleg for å gå ned i vekt. Ein meta-analyse utført i 2019 viste at det totale daglege energiinntaket til personar som et frukost er i gjennomsnitt høgare, enn til dei som ikkje et frukost. Sistnemnde var i gjennomsnitt i underkant av ein halv kilo lettere. Så, i følgje resultata frå denne store studien, treng du ikkje nødvendigvis å ete frukost om du vil gå ned i vekt.<br/><br/>Gå ned i vekt med rett kost – det er så enkelt det er å leggje sunn mat på tallerkenen<br/><br/>Friske grønsaker, fisk eller kjøt som proteinkjelder og andre sunne ingrediensar fremkaller smak i gryta og eit smil på leppene – ideelt også når du tråkker på skalaen. Ein amerikansk studie har vist at folk som lagar sin eigen mat og bevisst gjer med det dei et, har ein kroppsmasseindeks i normalområdet. Restaurantbesøk eller snøggmat lokker deg derimot raskt inn i sukkerfella: Ofte er det ingen indikasjon på kor mykje sukker det er i salatdressingane, kor mykje feitt potetene var steikte i eller om kjøtet ikkje var behandla.<br/><br/>Ein sunn lunsj består av tre delar – den største delen er frukt eller grønsaker og skal dekke halvparten av tallerkenen. Ein fjerdedel av måltidet skal bestå av protein, dvs. fisk, kjøt eller tofu. Kvartalet består av karbohydrat og er helst laga av fullkornsprodukt. Viktig: Ikkje et ved skrivebordet på kontoret, men stimuler stoffskiftet og ta gjerne ein kort spasertur før eller etter lunsj.<br/><br/>Når bør du ete for å gå ned i vekt?<br/><br/>Om kvelden bør du fokusere på lette måltid som har lite karbohydrat. Desse er minst sannsynlege for å få insulin til å skyte i været, noko som er bra for kroppen vår. Grønsaker, mjølkeprodukt og nøtter, til dømes, er godt eigna til dette.<br/><br/>Du bør også passe på at du ikkje et middag for seint. Det er best å ha spist til kl. 19.00 – så kan kroppen slappe av og forberede seg på kvelden. Tilstrekkelig søvn er viktig for sunt vekttap. Ein amerikansk studie fann at folk som sov om lag åtte timar om natta hadde betre fettavleiingar. Så god natt! Tillat deg sjølv meir enn seks timar med søvn, slik at du kan starte neste dag frisk og forfriska.<br/><br/>Å gå ned i vekt utan trening – er det verkeleg mogleg?<br/><br/>Det ville vore så enkelt, om ein berre kunne oppnå drømmevekta ved å senke kaloriinntaket. Men du veit sikkert visdomen i at kosten berre er den eine sida av mynten og mosjon er den andre. Så ingenting hjelper: Ta på deg sportstøyet og gå!<br/><br/>Alle som, i tillegg til idrettsprogram som jogging, turgåing eller bading, òg lèt heisen gå aleine og tar trappa, tar ein liten omveg eller nyttar sykkelen i staden for bilen, gjer wellis òg kalla noko godt. Sjølv enkel gange er bra for helsa. |
| Why We Open Sourced the Anvil App Server<br/><br/>Why Open Source?<br/><br/>A little while ago, we open-sourced the Anvil App Server. The community reaction has been great, even a little overwhelming (yes, every reply to that announcement really did land in my inbox!). We've already incorporated a bunch of that feedback into our version 1.2 release. But we keep getting asked, " Why did you open-source such a core part of your product? "<br/><br/>Why do this at all?<br/><br/>Anvil is a tool that makes it as simple as possible to build a web app. We do that by enabling you to build the whole application in one language, Python.<br/><br/>Simple hosting is part of that.<br/><br/>The web platform is broken , and Anvil is our attempt to fix it. And, because there is so much complexity in deploying a web app, a cloud-hosted service was the best way to provide the simplicity we want. That way, you can build your app in the Anvil Editor, and make it live on the Internet with one click.<br/><br/>But we kept hearing from people who said, "that's great, but…"<br/><br/>"…but I need to run this on an offshore platform without reliable internet access"<br/><br/>"…but I want to package my app into an IoT device I sell"<br/><br/>or simply, "…but if I'm putting my eggs in this basket, how can I be sure I can still run my app in ten years' time?"<br/><br/>These are all good points! A cloud service isn't the right solution for everyone. If we want to serve these users, there's got to be some way for them to get their apps out of Anvil and run them locally, under their own complete control.<br/><br/>Open Source: Escape hatch, not an ejector seat<br/><br/>We believe in escape hatches, not ejector seats. At conferences, we sometimes get asked, "can I export this as a Flask+JS app?". Sure, it would be possible – we could generate a server package, compile the client-side Python to Javascript, and spit out a classic web app. But it would have serious drawbacks, because:<br/><br/>Not a comfy ride.<br/><br/>Code generation is an ejector seat. Generated code is better than nothing – at least you can edit it! But the moment you edit that code, you lose all the benefits of the system that generated it. If you're using Anvil because of its drag-and-drop editor and Python in the browser, why should our locally-hosted users have to use vim and Javascript?<br/><br/>So we did it the right way: we open-sourced Anvil's runtime engine. It's the same code that serves your app in our hosted service, and it represents your app the same way. You can edit your code with a text editor, run it, then git push it back into our online IDE. It's not an ejector seat: there's no explosive transition. It's an escape hatch: you can climb out, and climb right back in.<br/><br/>What about our business model?<br/><br/>Anvil was never meant to be one of those enterprise low-code systems that charge you $20/mo for each person who uses your app. Anvil is a developer tool. The apps you develop are yours. Enabling you to run them on a Raspberry Pi is cool, but it doesn't change our business model.<br/><br/>We're doing what we always were: We make and sell a development tool that makes it drastically simpler to build web applications. We provide hosting for Anvil apps. We offer the entire development-and-hosting platform on-site for enterprise customers. And, of course, we offer a free plan so that everyone can use Anvil for hobby or educational purposes – or to start building something and see how it goes.<br/><br/>We've open-sourced the Anvil App Server for the (relatively small) number of people who need it, and to provide the ultimate insurance policy. Sure, you can build an app with vim and host it yourself, without even registering an account with us (we've got docs to show you how!). But the Anvil Editor is the world's easiest way to build a web app, and our hosted service is the easiest way to deploy it – so that's what we expect most of our users to continue doing. And you can build with confidence, knowing that the open-source code is right there if you need it.<br/><br/>Try it yourself<br/><br/>If our development philosophy resonates with you, why not try Anvil yourself? | Kvifor vi opnar Anvil App-tenaren<br/><br/>Kvifor open kjeldekode?<br/><br/>For ein liten stund sidan opna me Anvil App Server. Fellesskapen har vore stor, til og med litt overveldande (ja, kvart svar på den kunngjeringa landa verkeleg i innboksen min!). Me har allereie teke med ei mengd av den tilbakemeldinga i versjon 1.2-utgjevinga vår. Men me blir stadig spurt, " Kvifor opnar du ein så viktig del av produktet ditt?"<br/><br/>Kvifor gjer du dette i det heile tatt?<br/><br/>Anvil er eit verktøy som gjer det så enkelt som mogleg å byggje eit nettprogram. Det gjer vi ved å la deg byggje heile programmet på eitt språk, Python.<br/><br/>Enkel hosting er ein del av det.<br/><br/>Nettplattforma er øydelagd, og Anvil er vårt forsøk på å fikse det. Og fordi det er så mykje kompleksitet i å distribuere ein nettapp, var ei sky-vert-teneste den beste måten å levere den enkelheten vi ønskjer. På den måten kan du byggje appen din i Anvil Editor, og gjere den live på Internett med eitt klikk.<br/><br/>Men me høyrde stadig frå folk som sa, "Det er flott, men..."<br/><br/>"...men eg må køyre dette på ein offshore-plattform utan påliteleg internettilgang"<br/><br/>"...men eg vil pakke appen min inn i ei IoT-eining eg sel"<br/><br/>eller rett og slett, "...men om eg legg egga mine i denne korga, korleis kan eg vera sikker på at eg framleis kan køyre appen min om ti år?"<br/><br/>Dette er alle gode poeng! Ei skybasert teneste er ikkje den rette løysinga for alle. Viss me ønskjer å tena desse brukarane, må det finnast ein måte for dei å få appane sine ut av Anvil og køyre dei lokalt, under deira eigen full kontroll.<br/><br/>Open kjelde: Escape-luke, ikkje utløysarsete<br/><br/>Vi trur på rømningsluker, ikkje ejektorseter. På konferansar blir vi av og til spurt, "kan eg eksportere dette som ein Flask+JS-app?". Jada, det ville vere mogleg - vi kunne generere ein tenarpakke, kompilere klientsida Python til Javascript, og spytte ut ein klassisk nettapp. Men det ville ha alvorlige ulemper, fordi:<br/><br/>Ikkje ein koseleg tur.<br/><br/>Kodegenerering er eit utløysarsete. Generert kode er betre enn ingenting – i det minste kan du redigera han! Men i det augneblinken du endrar koden, mistar du alle fordelane med systemet som genererte han. Dersom du brukar Anvil på grunn av dra-og-slipp-redigeringa og Python i nettlesaren, kvifor skulle dei lokalt vertne brukarane våre måtte bruke vim og Javascript?<br/><br/>Så vi gjorde det på rett måte: Vi bygde køyretidsmotoren til Anvil med open kjeldekode. Det er den same koden som tener appen din i den vertsbaserte tenesta vår, og han representerer appen din på same måten. Du kan redigera koden din med eit tekstredigeringsprogram, køyra han, og så putta han tilbake i vår nettbaserte IDE. Det er ikkje eit ejektorsete: det er ingen eksplosiv overgang. Det er ein rømningsluke: du kan klatra ut, og klatra rett inn igjen.<br/><br/>Kva med forretningsmodellen vår?<br/><br/>Anvil var aldri meint å vera eit av dei føretaket sine lågkodesystem som kostar deg 20 dollar i månaden for kvar person som brukar appen din. Anvil er eit utviklarverktøy. Appane du utviklar er dine. Å la deg køyre dei på ein Raspberry Pi er kult, men det endrar ikkje forretningsmodellen vår.<br/><br/>Vi gjer det vi alltid har vore: Vi lagar og sel eit utviklingsverktøy som gjer det drastisk enklare å byggje nettprogram. Vi tilbyr hosting for Anvil-program. Vi tilbyr heile utviklings- og hostingplattforma på staden for bedriftskundar. Og sjølvsagt tilbyr vi ein gratis plan slik at alle kan bruke Ambolten til hobby- eller utdanningsføremål – eller til å begynne å byggje noko og sjå korleis det går.<br/><br/>Vi har utvikla Anvil App Server med open kjeldekode for det (relativt små) talet på menneske som treng det, og for å tilby den ultimate forsikringspolicyen. Visst, du kan byggje ein app med vim og verta det sjølv, utan å registrere ein konto hos oss (vi har dokument som viser deg korleis!). Men Anvil Editor er verdas enklaste måte å byggje ein nett-app på, og den vertsbaserte tenesta vår er den enklaste måten å distribuere den på – så det er det vi forventar at dei fleste av brukarane våre skal halde fram med. Og du kan byggje med sjølvtillit, viss du veit at open kjeldekode er der om du treng det.<br/><br/>Prøv sjølv<br/><br/>Dersom utviklingsfilosofien vår resonerer med deg, kvifor ikkje prøve Anvil sjølv? |
