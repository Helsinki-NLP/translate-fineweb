| Leclaire<br/><br/>The historic Leclaire neighborhood, once referred to as Edwardsville's "suburb to the south," was founded as a cooperative community in 1890 and remained a separate village until annexed to the city of Edwardsville in 1934. Newspapers and magazines throughout the United States and Europe reported on the Leclaire experiment, particularly during the first 20 years of its existence. In 1979, due to its unique history, the former village was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.<br/><br/>Leclaire was founded by Nelson Oliver Nelson, a St. Louis plumbing manufacturer who, for many years, sought to advance the plight of the working class. Nelson wanted to improve working conditions for his employees and provide housing near the factories so workers and their families could easily participate in recreational and educational programs offered free of charge by the company. Prior to 1890, while still in St. Louis, the N. O. Nelson Company's manufacturing and distribution businesses began providing profit sharing along with educational and recreational opportunities. The Leclaire cooperative experiment would bring additional benefits.<br/><br/>When Nelson employees indicated they wanted to relocate to a rural location, company representatives approached leaders of small towns in several Missouri and Illinois communities near their St. Louis headquarters. They were looking for a suitable property to build new factories and a model village. South of Edwardsville they found a 125-acre tract of land with access to water, coal, and transportation. Local businessmen acted quickly to offer a financial incentive. In less than three weeks, the community raised a fund of $20,000 from individual contributions of between $1 and $1,000 to entice Nelson to choose Edwardsville for his enterprise.<br/><br/>City leaders had hoped to locate property inside the city limits of Edwardsville, but when no suitable site could be found, they were confident that the Nelson investment south of town would soon become a part of Edwardsville. Although Nelson fulfilled all the contingencies for construction and job creation in his contract, it would be 44 years before annexation to Edwardsville. Leclaire, bounded by Madison/Brown Avenues to the east, the railroad tracks to the west, Hadley/McKinley Avenues on the south and Wolf Street to the north, remained an independent village from 1890 to 1934. During that time it earned a reputation for innovations in business, education and residential planning.<br/><br/>The village of Leclaire on a 1931 map of Edwardsville<br/>Courtesy of Paul Jenkins<br/><br/>Nelson's decision to build a village was not made on a whim. By the late 1880s he was an international leader in the fields of cooperation and profit-sharing, exchanging social theories with others around the world while expanding his St. Louis business. He named his experimental village after the Parisian profit-sharer, Edme Jean Leclaire, but he visited many other social visionaries who provided information and inspiration. Compiling the best ideas from these examples, Nelson founded Leclaire to, in his words, "give work, promote intelligence, provide recreation, foster beauty, and make homes." These were all factors he determined necessary for men to lead fulfilling lives. Later writers used these words to formulate Leclaire's founding principles: Work, Homes, Education, Recreation, and Beauty, but with the additional important principle of Freedom.<br/><br/>Work<br/><br/>Work could be considered the most important of these factors since without the factory jobs in Leclaire, there would be no village. The brick factory buildings were designed by architect E. A. Cameron to provide natural light, ventilation in the summer, and heated floors in the winter. There was a fire suppression system and, although industrial accidents were not eliminated, every effort was made to guarantee the safety of the workers. The ivy-covered brick buildings were surrounded by well-manicured lawns and flower gardens giving the complex a campus-like appearance. In 1894, New York World reporter Nellie Bly called the buildings "the ideal perfection of buildings for man to labor in".<br/><br/>The manufacturing complex of the N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company in Leclaire<br/>From Friends of Leclaire<br/><br/>Nelson company policies were designed to protect the financial stability of employees. Workers could earn a share of the profits and have a voice in the company if they chose that option. The profit-sharing plan gave Nelson employees a pride of ownership that resulted in a supportive workforce. There were a few short-lived labor strikes over the years, but for the most part, labor problems were rare. Workers also had reasonable hours and competitive wages. There was a provident fund that provided for pensions and sick leave, as well as widow pensions if a worker died, whether or not the death was related to his employment.<br/><br/>Company headquarters for the N. O. Nelson Company (NONCO) remained in St. Louis, but all of the N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company was moved to Leclaire. The manufacturing company was divided into shops that made a variety of products. In 1900, the shops became independent companies for tax purposes, but all were still owned by the N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company. The shops included the Cabinet Mill where wood products from cabinetry to millwork were produced. The skilled craftsmen that worked here also fulfilled special contracts, including teller cages for a local bank and an altar still in use at St. Andrew's Episcopal Church in Edwardsville. The Marble Shop specialized in architectural marble that was cut and installed by Nelson crews in homes, businesses, and even state capitols throughout the Midwest. The Machine Shop, which became Bignall and Keeler, made pipe fitting machines, pumps, gauges, and various mechanical tools expected in the plumbing trade. They also branched out to manufacture specialty items like the Leclaire Bicycle in the mid-1890s. The Brass Shop included a foundry where various plumbing pipes and tools were manufactured. These examples represent just some of the work done in the Leclaire factories. The company's logo was a stylized "NONCO" that can still be seen on plumbing fixtures and some fire hydrants in Edwardsville today.<br/><br/>Homes<br/><br/>Before homes could be built, housing was needed for workers who were completing the factory buildings as well as building homes. To meet those needs, the company built the "Club House," a large building that served many purposes. In addition to lodging, it was the community's first educational building, and it contained a well-stocked library.<br/><br/>Construction of the residential portion of Leclaire began immediately after the village was founded in June of 1890. Julius Pitzman, the innovative landscape architect who laid out the first lots in Leclaire, set them up with a number of protective covenants. The covenants provided for wide, curvilinear streets, large lots, and a deed restriction that limited the properties to residential or educational purposes only. The company paved the streets, provided electric street lights, installed sidewalks, and planted hundreds of trees along the streets of Leclaire. Later sections of Leclaire were laid out with a conventional grid design and smaller lots, but still included the deed restrictions.<br/><br/>A Leclaire Victorian cottage in 1907<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Initially the homes were built by the company and then sold at near cost to Nelson employees to encourage home ownership. If a worker became ill and could not make his mortgage, payments were suspended until after he returned to work. The homes were offered in a variety of house designs and the company advertised that no two dwellings were alike. The earliest homes were primarily Victorian cottages that came with electricity and running water. These were followed by bungalows, foursquares, and even some kit homes. Residents could purchase a company-built home or buy an empty lot and build a house themselves, provided the architectural design met company standards.<br/><br/>In later years, lots were sold to investors, usually Edwardsville residents, and many homes in the 1920s were built by local contractors who then sold them to area residents.<br/><br/>Education<br/><br/>Nelson believed in education for everyone, including the working class. Educational programming began with a kindergarten at the Club House in 1892 and continued in the new educational building at 722 Holyoake Road. Commonly called the "School House," this building provided a large hall for meetings and programs, but had moveable partitions to divide it into classroom space during the day. In the evenings, there were dances, meetings, or programs of the Leclaire Self-Culture Club which featured weekly lectures by Washington University professors or nationally known speakers who, like N. O. Nelson, were part of the social betterment movement at the turn of the century. These included Jane Addams, Edward Everett Hale, Samuel "Golden Rule" Jones, and author Charlotte Perkins Gilman, among others.<br/><br/>Children enrolled in the Leclaire kindergarten in 1913<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>In the ten years following the 1895 construction of the education building, there were a series of educational experiments including an industrial school, college, night school, and an academy. The earliest and longest-lived endeavor was the morning kindergarten, founded in 1892, that used the Fröbel Model. This two-year program was free to everyone, including Edwardsville children, until 1931 when for financial reasons the company began charging tuition to students who were not the children of employees. Nelson Manufacturing operated a kindergarten until 1934 when the building was turned over to the Edwardsville School District for a nominal fee.<br/><br/>Recreation<br/><br/>Boaters on Leclaire Lake in 1915<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Recreation was an important feature of Leclaire. The company provided sports facilities for baseball, tennis, and later, football. A bowling and billiard hall was constructed and there was a lake for boating, swimming, fishing, or ice skating in winter. Leclaire Park was furnished with boathouses, male & female bath houses, and a large pavilion. Residents organized dances, hayrides, spelling bees, and other activities, and the company sponsored a band that played regularly at entertainments in the village or in Edwardsville. Like the educational functions at the Club House and School House, the recreational facilities at Leclaire were open to all and were often a destination for Edwardsville and even St. Louis visitors.<br/><br/>Beauty<br/><br/>Early photograph of Leclaire Lake<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>The last of the factors Nelson deemed important for a satisfying life concerned the environment. Nelson knew about the importance of healthy living. He valued the beauty and cleanliness that could be found in the country, and encouraged all in Leclaire to beautify their property by planting gardens and orchards. Nelson himself led by example, so a company greenhouse provided free flowers and competitions were held for the most beautiful yards. Leclaire was laid out so that the entire village had a park-like setting still evident today.<br/><br/>Freedom<br/><br/>The Leclaire Cooperative store<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Nelson listed five founding principles for Leclaire, but modern writers add a sixth: Freedom. All of the programs offered by the company were available to employees as well as local residents, but none were mandatory. The freedom to choose whether or not to participate in company programs was entirely up to the individual. Residents of Leclaire could work for Nelson Manufacturing or elsewhere, and workers were under no obligation to live in Leclaire. Participation in recreational and educational programs was also optional. There was also a company store where employees could shop, but unlike other company towns, no one was in debt to the company store. The Leclaire Store was a cooperative where members were charged fair market prices, but were then paid quarterly dividends.<br/><br/>A Different Company Town<br/><br/>All of these benefits made Leclaire unique from other company towns. But there were also individual instances where the company showed compassion and care for the employees. The company closed the factories and hired excursion trains to take workers and their families to St. Louis for a day at the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair. When money was tight, Nelson would occasionally place extra cash in each pay envelope to make life easier for workers, and if he instituted a program the men did not agree with, they talked it out and, as often as not, Nelson would reverse himself.<br/><br/>Born in Lillesand, Norway, in 1841, N. O. Nelson was a complicated man. He was a capitalist who believed in free enterprise, but also a socialist, a follower of the "Golden Rule", and a patriot who served for the Union in the Civil War. By 1900, he was a multimillionaire, but by the time of his death in 1922, he had given it all away for the betterment of the working class.<br/><br/>Although Leclaire was not Nelson's only social experiment, it is considered his most successful endeavor. Other major efforts for social betterment included a chain of co-operative grocery stores in New Orleans, a kindergarten for the children of black employees in his Bessemer, Alabama, factories, and a home for consumptives in Indio, California.<br/><br/>Nelson's Village of Leclaire was renowned internationally as a noteworthy and successful experiment. It was described in the New York World on numerous occasions but in particular by reporter Nellie Bly in 1894 who wrote at length about the model town where "The labor question is solved and everybody happy in a little village near St. Louis." The Los Angeles Times also regularly reported on N. O. Nelson, as did the Chicago Daily Tribune and numerous other publications.<br/><br/>In a speech at Leclaire's 15th anniversary celebration in 1915, Nelson said, "Leclaire extends to you a wide open hospitality, and bids you enjoy today the ease and comfort and beauty and inspiration which we enjoy every day." More than a century has passed since that day, but the invitation still stands. Residents and researchers are invited to learn about Leclaire's history and consider the lessons that might be learned for the betterment of future generations.<br/><br/>One of the former buildings of the manufacturing complex in 2019, which now serves as the N. O. Nelson Campus of Lewis and Clark Community College<br/>Photo by Ben Ostermeier<br/><br/>Friends of Leclaire, organized in 1990 following Leclaire's Centennial celebration, promotes the history of Leclaire through a website (historic-leclaire.org), publications, and a festival, Leclaire Parkfest, held annually on the third Sunday in October | Leclaire<br/><br/>Den historiske bydelen Leclaire, ein gong kalla Edwardsville sin «forstad i sør», vart grunnlagd som ein samarbeidskommune i 1890 og vart verande ein eigen landsby fram til han vart annektert av byen Edwardsville i 1934. Aviser og magasin over heile USA og Europa rapporterte om Leclaire-eksperimentet, særleg i løpet av dei første 20 åra det eksisterte. I 1979 vart den tidlegare landsbyen på grunn av si unike historie oppført på det nasjonale registeret over historiske stader.<br/><br/>Leclaire vart grunnlagd av Nelson Oliver Nelson, ein rørlegger frå St. Louis som i mange år prøvde å fremje vanskane til arbeidarklassen. Nelson ønskte å betre arbeidstilhøva for dei tilsette og tilby bustader i nærleiken av fabrikkane slik at arbeidarane og familiane deira lett kunne delta i fritids- og utdanningsprogram som vart tilbydd gratis av selskapet. Før 1890, medan dei framleis var i St. Louis, byrja N. O. Nelson Company sine produksjons- og distribusjonsverksemder å gje profittdeling saman med utdannings- og rekreasjonsmoglegheiter. Leclaire-samarbeidseksperimentet ville gje ytterlegare nyttar.<br/><br/>Då Nelson-ansatte indikerte at dei ønskte å flytte til ein landleg stad, kontakta representantar for selskapet leiarane for småbyar i fleire samfunn i Missouri og Illinois nær hovudkvarteret deira i St. Louis. Dei var på utkikk etter ein passande eigedom for å byggje nye fabrikkar og ein modelllandsby. Sør for Edwardsville fann dei eit landområde på 125 dekar med tilgang til vatn, kol og transport. Lokale forretningsmenn handla raskt for å tilby eit økonomisk insentiv. På mindre enn tre veker samla samfunnet inn eit fond på 20 000 dollar frå individuelle bidrag på mellom 1 og 1 000 dollar for å lokka Nelson til å velje Edwardsville til verksemda si.<br/><br/>Byleiarane hadde håpt å lokalisere eigedom innanfor bygrensene til Edwardsville, men då ein ikkje fann nokon passande stad, var dei sikre på at Nelson-investeringa sør for byen snart skulle bli ein del av Edwardsville. Sjølv om Nelson oppfylte alle vilkåra for bygging og jobbskaping i kontrakten sin, ville det ta 44 år før han vart annektert til Edwardsville. Leclaire, avgrensa av Madison/Brown Avenues i aust, jernbanespora i vest, Hadley/McKinley Avenues i sør og Wolf Street i nord, vart verande ein sjølvstendig landsby frå 1890 til 1934. I løpet av den tida fekk det eit rykte for nyvinningar innan næringsliv, utdanning og bustadplanlegging.<br/><br/>Landsbyen Leclaire på eit kart frå 1931 over Edwardsville<br/>Songar skrivne av Paul Jenkins<br/><br/>Mot slutten av 1880-åra var han ein internasjonal leiar innan samarbeid og profittdeling, og utveksla sosiale teoriar med andre rundt om i verda samtidig som han ekspanderte forretningane sine i St. Louis. Han namngav den eksperimentelle landsbyen sin etter den parisiske profittsamlaren, Edme Jean Leclaire, men han vitja mange andre sosiale visjonar som gav informasjon og inspirasjon. Etter å ha kompilert dei beste ideane frå desse døma, grunnla Nelson Leclaire for å, med orda sine, «gje arbeid, fremje intelligens, gje rekreasjon, fremje skjønnhet og lage hus». Seinare forfattarar brukte desse orda til å formulere dei grunnleggjande prinsippa til Leclaire: arbeid, heimar, utdanning, rekreasjon og skjønnhet, men med det ytterlegare viktige prinsippet om fridom.<br/><br/>Arbeid<br/><br/>Arbeidet kunne reknast som det viktigaste av desse faktorane sidan det ikkje ville ha vore nokon landsby utan fabrikkarbeida i Leclaire. Teglfabrikkbygningane vart teikna av arkitekt E. A. Cameron for å gje naturleg lys, ventilasjon om sommaren og oppvarma golv om vinteren. Det var eit brannslokkingssystem og sjølv om industriulukker ikkje vart eliminert, vart det gjort alt for å garantere tryggleiken til arbeidarane. Dei mursteinsdekte bygningane var omgjeve av velstelte plenar og blomsterhagar som gav komplekset eit campus-aktig utsjånad. I 1894 kalla New York World-reporteren Nellie Bly bygningane «den ideelle perfeksjonen av bygningar for menneske å arbeide i».<br/><br/>Produksjonskomplekset til N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company i Leclaire<br/>Frå vener av Leclaire<br/><br/>Nelson sin selskapspolitikk var utforma for å verne om den finansielle stabiliteten til dei tilsette. Arbeidarane kunne tene ein del av profitten og få ei stemme i selskapet dersom dei valde det valet. Planen om profittdeling gav dei tilsette i Nelson ein eigenskapsstoltheit som resulterte i ei støttende arbeidsstyrke. Det var nokre få kortvarige arbeidsstreikar gjennom åra, men for det meste var arbeidsløyse sjeldne. Arbeidarane hadde òg rimeleg arbeidstid og konkurransedyktige lønningar. Det var eit fond som sørgde for pensjon og sjukepensjon, samt enkepensjon dersom ein arbeidar døydde, uansett om dødsfallet var knytt til arbeidsforholdet hans eller ikkje.<br/><br/>Selskapet sitt hovudkvarter for N. O. Nelson Company (NONCO) vart verande i St. Louis, men heile N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company vart flytta til Leclaire. Produksjonsselskapet vart delt inn i butikkar som laga ei rekkje ulike produkt. I 1900 blei butikkane sjølvstendige selskap for skattemessige føremål, men alle var framleis eigd av N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company. Butikkane inkluderte Cabinet Mill der det vart produsert treprodukt frå skap til mølleverk. Dei dyktige handverkarane som arbeidde her oppfylte òg spesielle kontraktar, inkludert forteljarbur for ein lokal bank og eit altar som framleis er i bruk ved St. Andrew's Episcopal Church i Edwardsville. Marmorbutikken spesialiserte seg på arkitektonisk marmor som vart hogd og installert av Nelson-mannskap i heimar, forretningar og til og med delstatshovudstader i heile Midtvesten. Maskinbutikken, som vart Bignall og Keeler, laga røyrmontasjemaskinar, pumpar, målarar og ulike mekaniske verktøy som ein venta seg i rørhandelen. Dei forgreina seg òg til å produsere spesialartiklar som Leclaire Bicycle på midten av 1890-talet. Brass Shop inkluderte eit støperi der ulike rør og verktøy vart produsert. Desse døma representerer berre noko av arbeidet som vart gjort i Leclaire-fabrikkane. Logoen til selskapet var ein stilisert «NONCO» som framleis kan sjåast på rørleggerar og nokre brannhydrantar i Edwardsville i dag.<br/><br/>Heime<br/><br/>Før det kunne byggjast hus, var det naudsynt med hus for arbeidarar som stod ferdige med fabrikkbygningane, og for å møte desse behova bygde selskapet «Klubbhuset», ein stor bygning som tente mange føremål. I tillegg til losji var det kommunens første utdanningsbygg, og det inneheldt eit velfylt bibliotek.<br/><br/>Bygginga av bustaddelen av Leclaire starta umiddelbart etter at landsbyen vart grunnlagd i juni 1890. Julius Pitzman, den nyskapande landskapsarkitekten som la ut dei første tomtene i Leclaire, sette dei opp med ei rekkje vernepaktar. Avtalane omfatta breie, krumme gater, store tomter, og ei handlingsrestriksjon som avgrensa eigedomane til berre bustad- eller utdanningsføremål. Selskapet brola gatene, gav elektrisk gatelys, installerte fortau og planta hundrevis av tre langs gatene i Leclaire. Seinare delar av Leclaire vart lagt ut med eit konvensjonelt rutenettdesign og mindre tomter, men inkluderte likevel handlingsrestriksjonane.<br/><br/>Ei viktoriansk hytte frå Leclaire i 1907<br/>Frå Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Opphavleg vart husa bygde av selskapet og så selt til nær kostnad for Nelson-tilsette for å oppmuntre til eigedomsrett. Dersom ein arbeidar vart sjuk og ikkje kunne betale pantelånet sitt, vart betalingane innstilte til han kom tilbake til arbeid. Husa vart tilbodne i ei rekkje ulike utformingar og selskapet annonserte at ikkje to hus var like, dei tidlegaste husa var hovudsakleg viktorianske hytter som kom med elektrisitet og rennande vatn. Desse vart etterfølgd av bungalowar, firkantar og til og med nokre kit-heimar. Innbyggjarane kunne kjøpe ein firmabygd heim eller kjøpe ein tom tomt og bygge eit hus sjølv, så lenge den arkitektoniske utforminga oppfylte firmastandarden.<br/><br/>I seinare år vart tomter seld til investorar, vanlegvis innbyggjarane i Edwardsville, og mange hus i 1920-åra vart bygd av lokale entreprenørar som så selde dei til innbyggjarane i området.<br/><br/>Utdanning<br/><br/>Nelson trudde på utdanning for alle, også arbeidarklassen, og byrja med ein barnehage i klubbhuset i 1892 og heldt fram i den nye utdanningsbygningen ved 722 Holyoake Road. Bygningen vart vanlegvis kalla «Skolehuset», og var ein stor sal for møte og program, men hadde flyttbare skiljeveggar som delte han inn i klasserom om dagen. Om kveldene var det dansar, møte eller program i Leclaire Self-Culture Club som hadde vekentlege førelesingar av professorar ved Washington University eller nasjonalt kjende talarar som, som N. O. Nelson, var ein del av den sosiale forbetringsrørsla ved århundreskiftet. Desse var mellom anna Jane Addams, Edward Everett Hale, Samuel «Golden Rule» Jones og forfattaren Charlotte Perkins Gilman.<br/><br/>I 1913 vart han utnemnd til lærar i Leclaire.<br/>Frå Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>I dei ti åra etter bygginga av utdanningsbygningen i 1895 vart det gjennomført ei rekkje pedagogiske eksperiment med blant anna ein industriskule, høgskule, kveldsskule og eit akademi. Den tidlegaste og lengstlevande verksemda var morgonbarnehagen, grunnlagd i 1892, som nytta Fröbelmodellen. Dette toårige programmet var gratis for alle, inkludert Edwardsville-barn, fram til 1931 då selskapet av økonomiske årsaker byrja å ta betalt for undervisning til studentar som ikkje var barn av tilsette. Nelson Manufacturing dreiv ein barnehage fram til 1934, då bygningen vart overført til Edwardsville School District mot eit nominelt gebyr.<br/><br/>Rekreasjon<br/><br/>Båtfolk på Leclairesjøen i 1915<br/>Frå Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Fritidsaktivitetar var ein viktig del av Leclaire. Selskapet hadde sportsfasilitetar for baseball, tennis og seinare fotball. Det vart bygd ein bowling- og biljardhall og det var ein innsjø for båtliv, bading, fiske eller skøyter om vinteren. Leclaire Park vart innreidd med naust, mannlege og kvinnelege badehus og ein stor paviljong. Innbyggjarane organiserte dansar, hayrider, stavingsbier og andre aktivitetar, og selskapet sponsa eit band som spelte regelmessig på underhaldningar i landsbyen eller i Edwardsville. Som dei pedagogiske funksjonane ved klubbhuset og skulehuset, var fritidsfasilitetene ved Leclaire opne for alle og var ofte ein destinasjon for Edwardsville og til og med for vitjande i St. Louis.<br/><br/>Skjønnhet<br/><br/>Tidleg fotografi av Leclairesjøen<br/>Frå Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Den siste faktoren som Nelson meinte var viktig for eit tilfredsstillende liv, gjaldt miljøet. Nelson visste kor viktig det var å leve sunt. Han verdset skjønnheten og reinleiken som kunne finnast i landet, og oppmuntra alle i Leclaire til å forskjønne eigedomane sine ved å planta hagar og frukthagar. Nelson sjølv leia ved eksempel, så eit firmadrivhus gav gratis blomar og det vart halde konkurransar for dei vakraste tuna. Leclaire vart lagt ut slik at heile landsbyen hadde eit parkliknande miljø som framleis er synleg i dag.<br/><br/>Fridom<br/><br/>Butikken til Leclaire-kooperativet<br/>Frå Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Nelson nemnde fem grunnleggjande prinsipp for Leclaire, men moderne forfattarar la til eit sjette: «Fridom». Alle programma som vart tilbodne av selskapet var tilgjengelege for tilsette så vel som lokale innbyggjarar, men ingen var obligatoriske. Innbyggjarane i Leclaire kunne arbeide for Nelson Manufacturing eller andre stader, og arbeidarane var ikkje pliktig til å bu i Leclaire. Deltaking i fritids- og utdanningsprogram var òg valfritt, og det var òg ein firmabutikk der dei tilsette kunne handle, men i motsetnad til andre firmabyar var ingen i gjeld til firmabutikken. Leclaire Store var eit samvirkelag der medlemmane fekk utbetalt rettferdige marknadsprisar, men fekk då utbetalt kvartalsvis utbytte.<br/><br/>Ein annan firmaby<br/><br/>Alle desse fordelane gjorde Leclaire unik frå andre selskapsbyar, men det var òg enkelte tilfelle der selskapet viste medkjensle og omsorg for dei tilsette. Selskapet lukkast fabrikkane og leigde ekskursjonstog for å ta arbeidarane og familiane deira til St. Louis for ein dag på verdsutstillinga i St. Louis i 1904. Når pengane var knappe, ville Nelson av og til leggje ekstra pengar i kvar lønskonvolutt for å gjere livet lettare for arbeidarane, og om han innstifta eit program som mennene ikkje var samde i, ville dei snakke det ut og, så ofte som ikkje, Nelson ville reversere seg sjølv.<br/><br/>N. O. Nelson, som var fødd i Lillesand i 1841, var ein kapitalist som trudde på fri verksemd, men òg ein sosialist, ein tilhengar av Den gylne regelen, og ein patriot som tenestegjorde for unionen i borgarkrigen. I 1900 vart han fleirmillionær, men då han døydde i 1922 hadde han gjeve alt bort til forbetring av arbeidarklassen.<br/><br/>Sjølv om Leclaire ikkje var Nelson sitt einaste sosiale eksperiment, vert det rekna som det mest vellukka forsøket hans. Andre store tiltak for sosial forbetring inkluderte ei kjede av kooperative matbutikkar i New Orleans, ein barnehage for barn av svarte tilsette i Bessemer i Alabama, fabrikkar og ein heim for forbrukarar i Indio i California.<br/><br/>Nelson's Village of Leclaire vart internasjonalt kjend som eit bemerkelsesverdig og vellukka eksperiment. Det vart skildra i New York World ved fleire høve, men særleg av reporteren Nellie Bly i 1894 som skreiv lenge om modellbyen der «arbeidsspørsmålet er løyst og alle glade i ein liten landsby nær St. Louis.» Los Angeles Times rapporterte òg regelmessig om N. O. Nelson, det same gjorde Chicago Daily Tribune og talrike andre publikasjonar.<br/><br/>I ein tale ved 15-årsjubileet til Leclaire i 1915 sa Nelson: «Leclaire utvidar til deg ein vid open gjestfridom, og tilbyr deg i dag den lettleiken og komforten og skjønnheten og inspirasjonen som vi nyter kvar dag.» Meir enn hundre år har gått sidan den dagen, men invitasjonen står framleis. Innbyggjarane og forskarane vert inviterte til å lære om Leclaire si historie og tenkje over lærdomane som kan lærast for å betre framtidige generasjonar.<br/><br/>Ein av dei tidlegare bygningane i produksjonskomplekset i 2019, som no fungerer som N. O. Nelson Campus of Lewis and Clark Community College<br/>Bilete av Ben Ostermeier<br/><br/>Friends of Leclaire, organisert i 1990 etter hundreårsfeiringa til Leclaire, fremjar historia til Leclaire gjennom ein nettstad (historic-leclaire.org), publikasjonar og ein festival, Leclaire Parkfest, som vert halden årleg den tredje sundagen i oktober. |
| Author Visits via Zoom or Skype<br/><br/>I'm excited to visit with your students via Zoom or Skype! Skype is a great option for schools/classes who aren't bringing in in-person authors, but who want to explore books and poetry, connect with an author, and ask one-on-one questions.<br/><br/>Cost<br/><br/>I offer 30-45-minute Zoom or Skype visits with schools for $125 per session (or $200 for two sessions happening within three hours in the morning or the afternoon; $325 for three sessions in one day; $425 for four sessions in one day). In each session, I try to get kids as actively involved as possible.

But the truth is that sometimes it's tough to be virtually interactive! The timing might not sync up correctly, which makes reading together a challenge, and it's really hard for me to hear individual students unless they come up and speak directly into the microphone/computer. But after some trial and error, I've discovered some ways to have the best virtual visits possible. Here they are: 10 ways to make my visit with your students a great experience!<br/><br/>Before the Visit<br/><br/>Get kids as excited as possible about the visit. Visit my website with them. Read some of my books with them. Gather some questions students have for me. Anything you do ahead of time to make it feel like a BIG DEAL will go a long way toward student engagement.<br/><br/>Position the video camera or laptop with webcam so that I can see as much of the audience as possible. It's hard to assess student engagement when I can only see a couple of students.<br/><br/>Limit each group to 50 students. It's incredibly hard to engage large groups via video.<br/><br/>I'll move quickly from topic to topic or poem to poem. Please remind students that they'll need to listen closely to understand what's going on.<br/><br/>Occasionally, I do a little Reader's Theater with students. If I send you any scripted student parts ahead of time, print a copy for EACH session and cut into pieces, if needed.<br/><br/>During the Visit<br/><br/>When I discuss a book, if you have that printed book, please hold it up for students to see.<br/><br/>You are my proxy. I often can't call on students and hear individual replies. So, I might say, "We're going to get 3 ideas. Raise your hand if you have an idea." Then YOU take over, call on three students, and announce those answers to everyone in the room and to me.<br/><br/>Choose confident, outgoing students for scripted student parts (if I send any ahead of time). During my in-person school visits, I try to draw out some of the less confident students, but I've found that this doesn't work as well during virtual visits because I can't hear them.<br/><br/>Have students with speaking parts sit up front. When it's time, have them stand up and remind them to speak loudly.<br/><br/>In virtual visits, behavior management falls solely on you. I often can't see exactly what's going on, so do please step in as needed. If there's a big disruption, just ask me to hold on for a moment so that I don't chatter on while nobody's paying attention:>)<br/><br/>Feel free to take pictures of me on-screen and share on social media–even though pictures of me often look ridiculous because I'm making funny faces or something while I read!<br/><br/>If you have any questions at all, please just ask, either before or during the visit!<br/><br/>Scheduling a Virtual Session<br/><br/>Are you interested in scheduling a virtual visit with me? Just email me to set up a date, and we'll go from there | Forfattar vitjar via forstørring eller Skype<br/><br/>Skype er eit flott alternativ for skular/klassar som ikkje tek med seg personlege forfattarar, men som ønskjer å utforske bøker og dikt, få kontakt med ein forfattar og stille spørsmål ein-til-en.<br/><br/>Kostnad<br/><br/>Eg tilbyr 30-45 minutts Zoom- eller Skype-besøk med skolar for $ 125 per økt (eller $ 200 for to økter som skjer innanfor tre timar om morgonen eller ettermiddagen; $ 325 for tre økter på ein dag; $ 425 for fire økter på ein dag). I kvar økt prøver eg å få borna så aktivt involverte som mogleg. Nei, det er ikkje den same typen tilknyting som eit personleg besøk, men det kan likevel vere inspirerande og motiverande for borna!<br/><br/>Kva vi driv med<br/><br/>Kvar økt for inntil 50 studentar inkluderer:<br/><br/>5 minuttar med teknisk oppsett<br/><br/>3 segment av 10ish-minutt kvar — Du vel mellom:<br/><br/>Korleis eg vart forfattar<br/><br/>Skriv denne boka (du vel kva bok eg skal fokusere på)<br/><br/>Lesing (Eg les nokre dikt og born hjelper meg å lese andre)<br/><br/>Klasseromspresentasjon (studentane dine sette på ei opplesing eller framføring for meg - eit veldig verdsett publikum!)<br/><br/>Skriv eit dikt saman<br/><br/>Spørsmål og svar- økt<br/><br/>5 minutt med pakking/farvel<br/><br/>Eg snakkar òg med klassar av førtenestelærarar eller grupper av tenestelærarar om poesi og skriving.<br/><br/>Tips for eit flott virtuelt besøk<br/><br/>Tips for eit vellukka virtuelt besøk<br/><br/>Eit av måla mine for virtuelle skulebesøk er å fange opp interaktiviteten som gjer personlege besøk vellukka og morosame. Men sanninga er at det av og til er vanskeleg å vere virtuelt interaktiv! Timingen er kanskje ikkje rett, noko som gjer lesing saman til ei utfordring, og det er verkeleg vanskeleg for meg å høyre dei einskilde elevane med mindre dei kjem opp og snakkar direkte inn i mikrofonen/datamaskina. Men etter litt prøving og feiling har eg oppdaga nokre måtar å få dei beste virtuelle vitjane på. Her er dei: 10 måtar å gjere besøket mitt med studentane dine ei stor oppleving!<br/><br/>Før vitjinga<br/><br/>Få borna så spente som mogleg på besøket. Besøk nettsida mi med dei. Les nokre av bøkene mine med dei. Samle nokre spørsmål studentane har til meg. Alt du gjer på førehand for å få det til å føles som ei BIG DEAL vil gå langt mot studentengasjement.<br/><br/>Plasser videokameraet eller laptopen med nettkamera slik at eg kan sjå så mykje av publikum som mogleg. Det er vanskeleg å vurdere studentengasjement når eg berre kan sjå eit par studentar.<br/><br/>Avgrens kvar gruppe til 50 elevar. Det er vanskeleg å engasjere store grupper via video.<br/><br/>Eg går raskt frå emne til emne eller dikt til dikt. Minn elevane på at dei må lytte nøye for å forstå kva som skjer.<br/><br/>Av og til gjer eg litt Reader's Theater med studentar. Om eg sender deg nokre skripta studentdelar på førehand, skriv ut ein kopi for HVER økt og kutt i bitar om det trengst.<br/><br/>Under vitjinga<br/><br/>Når eg drøftar ei bok, om du har den trykte boka, ver snill og hald henne opp for studentane å sjå.<br/><br/>Du er fullmektigen min. Eg kan ofte ikkje kalle på studentar og høyre individuelle svar. Så eg kan seie, "Vi skal få tre idear. Rekk opp handa om du har ein ide." Då tek DU over, kallar på tre studentar, og kunngjer desse svara til alle i rommet og til meg.<br/><br/>Vel sjølvsikre, utgåande studentar for skripta studentdelar (om eg sender noko på førehand). Under mine personlege skulebesøk prøver eg å trekke fram nokre av dei mindre sjølvsikre elevane, men eg har funne ut at dette ikkje fungerer like bra under virtuelle besøk fordi eg ikkje kan høyra dei.<br/><br/>Ta dei med deg og lat dei setja seg ned framfor deg! Og når tida er inne, skal du la dei setja seg ned og tala med høg røyst.<br/><br/>Når du er på virtuelt besøk, er det berre du som styrer åtferda. Eg ser ofte ikkje heilt kva som skjer, så ver snill og kom innom etter behov. Om det er ei stor bryting, ber du meg berre om å halde på eit øyeblikk slik at eg ikkje snakkar om det medan ingen bryr seg:>)<br/><br/>Føl deg fri til å ta bilder av meg på skjermen og dele på sosiale medier – selv om bilder av meg ofte ser latterlige ut fordi jeg lager morsomme fjes eller noe mens jeg leser!<br/><br/>Har du spørsmål i det heile, er det berre å spørje, anten før eller under besøket!<br/><br/>Planleggjer ei virtuell økt<br/><br/>Er du interessert i å planleggje eit virtuelt besøk med meg? Bare send meg ein e-post for å setje opp ein dato, så går vi derfra |
| News Archive<br/><br/>New book looks at ways in which to tackle HIV-challenges<br/><br/>2011-11-29<br/><br/>Prof. Dennis Francis with Marjorie Human who designed the cover of the book, Acting on HIV.<br/><br/>The HIV pandemic has brought out the best and worst in humans in terms of response. On the one hand it has prompted stigma and violence and on the other it has brought about constructive and supportive responses from various individuals and groups. A new book, Acting on HIV, edited by Prof. Dennis Francis, Dean of the Faculty of Education at the University of the Free State, looks at how drama can be used to promote vital social change as well as individual behavioural change.<br/><br/>Acting on HIV offers a systematic inquiry into drama as an approach to discuss HIV/AIDS and related attitudes and behaviours. The book is a scholarly text and includes the work of some twenty exceptionally creative authors. Contributing authors to the book include, amongst others, Proff. Hazel Barnes (University of the Witwatersrand), Rob Pattman (Stellenbosch University) and Yvonne Sliep from the University of KwaZulu-Natal.<br/><br/>"This project started in 2009 and has taken much of my time to bring together the work of exceptionally creative authors. The research that is communicated through the book is original and timely and makes a significant contribution to conversations about the role/s and significance of drama in addressing issues of HIV & AIDS," says Prof. Francis | Nyhendearkiv<br/><br/>Ny bok ser på korleis ein kan takle hiv-utfordringar<br/><br/>2011-11-29<br/><br/>Prof. Dennis Francis med Marjorie Human som designa omslaget til boka, Acting on HIV.<br/><br/>Hiv-pandemien har fått fram det beste og det verste i menneske når det gjeld respons, på den eine sida har det skapt stigma og vald, og på den andre sida har det ført til konstruktive og støttande responsar frå ulike individ og grupper. Ei ny bok, Acting on HIV, redigert av prof. Dennis Francis, dekan ved Det utdanningsvitenskapelige fakultet ved Fristatens Universitet, ser på korleis drama kan brukast til å fremje livsviktige sosiale endringar i tillegg til individuell åtferdsendring.<br/><br/>Å handle om HIV tilbyr ei systematisk utforsking av drama som ein tilnærming til å diskutere HIV/AIDS og tilknytte haldningar og åtferd. Boka er ein vitskapleg tekst og omfattar arbeida til om lag tjue særs kreative forfattarar. Medverkande forfattarar til boka er mellom andre Proff. Hazel Barnes (Universitetet i Witwatersrand), Rob Pattman (Stellenbosch University) og Yvonne Sliep frå Universitetet i KwaZulu-Natal.<br/><br/>"Dette prosjektet starta i 2009 og har tatt mykje av tida mi til å samle arbeidet til eksepsjonelt kreative forfattarar. Forskinga som blir formidla gjennom boka er original og aktuell, og gjev eit viktig bidrag til samtalar om rolla/rollene og tydinga dramaet har i å ta opp problemstillingar rundt hiv og aids, seier professor Francis. |

| Storyworld Spotlight<br/><br/>25 years of Tomb Raider<br/><br/>Tomb Raider is one of the most recognizable entertainment properties in the world. Since Lara Croft's first videogame appearance in Tomb Raider (1996), her exploits as an adventurous and quick-witted explorer have resonated widely with players, earning her a place in the pantheon of great pop culture characters. For that reason we will be putting The World of Lara Croft in the Storyworld Spotlight from December 22, 2021 to March 6, 2022.<br/><br/>Crafting a Croft<br/><br/>Lara Croft was created by studio Core Design, in Derby (UK), in 1996. The studio was looking for a lead character for their upcoming a 3D adventure game for PlayStation 1. A game in a 3rd person perspective where players would see the main character in full throughout every scene.<br/><br/>As the game was about 'raiding mysterious tombs deep under pyramids,' the lead character would need to look adventurous, and have the brains to survive complex raiding missions. After some deliberation, Lara Croft was born, a young, upper-class and utterly British woman, who was as enigmatic and intelligent as she was tough and self-reliant.<br/><br/>Success and controversy<br/><br/>Tomb Raider (1996) was a breakaway success for Core Design, who quickly doubled down on building Tomb Raider 2 (1997) and 3 (1998). A big part of the success was attributed to the games' leading lady, who found admirers both with male and female players. This baffled critics who just saw Lara Croft as a sexist cartoon.<br/><br/>Explore The World of Lara Croft in Storyworld<br/><br/>This exhibition explores the successful franchise in-depth. It looks at the history of the games and why its leading lady resonates with so many people. It also dives into the mystery of what makes Tomb Raider games tick, from the deep world building to the clever puzzles and traps, and from fantastic enemy and monster designs to the character design of the legendary heroine.<br/><br/>After all, mysteries are there to explore, and have been for the past 25 years.<br/><br/>Tickets<br/><br/>Buy your tickets for Storyworld online with a start date and entry time from Wednesday December 22. A ticket to Storyworld gives you free access to the Spotlight room where you can visit The World of Lara Croft.<br/><br/>Would you like to visit the Storyworld museum and the world's largest playable game exhibition: Game On at Forum Groningen at the same day?

Sidan Lara Croft dukka opp første gong i videospelet Tomb Raider (1996), har utnyttingane hennar som ein eventyrlysten og kvikkvittig oppdagar resonert mykje med spelarar, og ho har fått ein plass i panteonen til store popkulturkaraktærar. Av den grunn vil me setje The World of Lara Croft i Storyworld Spotlight frå 22. desember 2021 til 6. mars 2022.<br/><br/>Å laga ein croft<br/><br/>Lara Croft vart skapt av studioet Core Design, i Derby (Storbritannia), i 1996. Studioet var på utkikk etter ein hovudperson for det komande 3D-eventyrspelet deira til PlayStation 1. Eit spel i eit tredjepersonsperspektiv der spelarane skulle sjå hovudpersonen i sin helhet gjennom kvar scene.<br/><br/>Ettersom spelet dreidde seg om å 'raide mystiske graver djupt under pyramider', måtte hovudpersonen sjå eventyrlysten ut, og ha hjernene til å overleve komplekse raidoppdrag. Etter noko overveiing vart Lara Croft fødd, ei ung, overklasse og heilt britisk kvinne, som var like gåtefull og intelligent som ho var tøff og sjølvstendig.<br/><br/>Suksess og kontrovers<br/><br/>Tomb Raider (1996) var ein utbrytarsuksess for Core Design, som raskt dobla ned på å bygge Tomb Raider 2 (1997) og 3 (1998). Ein stor del av suksessen vart tilskriven speleleiaren, som fann beundrerar både med mannlege og kvinnelege spelarar. Dette forbløffa kritikarar som berre såg på Lara Croft som ein sexistisk teikneserie.<br/><br/>Utforsk verda til Lara Croft i Storyworld<br/><br/>Denne utstillinga utforskar den suksessrike franchisen i dybden, og ser på historia til leikane og kvifor den leiande damen resonerer med så mange menneske. Det dykkar òg ned i mysteriet om kva som gjer at Tomb Raider-spel tikkar, frå den djupe verdsbygningen til dei smarte gåtene og fellene, og frå fantastiske fiende- og monsterdesign til karakterdesignet til den legendariske heltinna.<br/><br/>Mysteriene er tross alt der for å utforska, og har vore det dei siste 25 åra.<br/><br/>Billettar<br/><br/>Kjøp billettane dine til Storyworld på nett med startdato og inngangstid frå onsdag 22. desember.

| Real Estate Word of the Day: Option<br/><br/>Option: An agreement to keep open, for a set period, an offer to sell or lease real property. An option can be used, for example, to give the buyer time to resolve questions of financing, title, zoning and feasibility before committing the buyer to purchase. Options are frequently used in the land assemblage process. The option must be supported by its actual consideration, separate and independent of the purchase price of the property. Mere recital of consideration alone is not sufficient except in a lease-option in which the provisions of the lease are themselves sufficient consideration to support the option. An option merely creates a contractual right; it does not give the optionee any estate in the property. At the time the option is signed, the owner does not sell, nor does the buyer purchase, the property. Although the owner is obligated to sell if given notice by the buyer, the buyer is not obligated to purchase. An option to buy is also known as a call; an option to sell is known as a put. | Dagens ord for fast eigedom: Val<br/><br/>Valmoglegheit: Avtale om å halde open, i ein fast periode, eit tilbod om å selje eller leige ut fast eigedom. Eit alternativ kan til dømes nyttast for å gje kjøparen tid til å løyse spørsmål om finansiering, tittel, reguleringsplan og gjennomførbarhet før kjøparen forpliktar seg til å kjøpe. Valet må støttast av eigen vurdering, separat og uavhengig av kjøpsprisen på eigedomen. Berre avgrensing av vederlaget er ikkje tilstrekkeleg utan i eit leigealternativ der vilkåra i leigeavtalen i seg sjølv er avgrensa nok til å støtte valet. Ei opsjon opprettar berre ein kontraktsfesta rett, det gjev ikkje opsjonstakaren nokon eigedom i eigedomen. Når opsjonen er signert, sel ikkje eigaren, og det gjer heller ikkje kjøparen, eigedomen. Sjølv om eigaren er forplikta til å selje dersom han får beskjed av kjøparen, er ikkje kjøparen forplikta til å kjøpe. Eit kjøpsopsjon er òg kjent som ein kjøpsopsjon. Eit seljeopsjon er kjend som ein put. |
| Benefits of Carotenoids for the Skin<br/><br/>Have you heard of carotenoids? These powerful phytochemicals are the pigmented constituents found in plants that give flowers, fruits, and leaves their yellow, orange and red colours.<br/><br/>Since the 1930s, scientists have identified about 800 carotenoids and about 40 are found in the human body, including the outermost layer of the epidermis, the dermis and subcutaneous fat. The most common carotenoids are beta-carotene, alpha-carotene, lutein, zeaxanthin, lycopene, and astaxanthin. You can read more about astaxanthin here.<br/><br/>The content of carotenoids in the skin is influenced by numerous factors, including the intake of fruits and vegetables, their bioavailability from various foods, supplementation, exposure to UV radiation, air pollution, alcohol consumption, smoking and stress.<br/><br/>How do Carotenoids Help My Skin?<br/><br/>Carotenoids are some of the best-known antioxidants for the skin and they also have important functions as anti-inflammatory agents.<br/><br/>Healthy Aging and Skin Repair<br/><br/>Antioxidants are essential for healthy skin because they help to prevent free radical damage to cells. Free radical damage causes premature aging and the onset of various types of skin cancers. Carotenoids, along with vitamin E, vitamin C, and Co enzyme Q10 are important dermal antioxidants.<br/><br/>Due to their antioxidant activity, carotenoids support and encourage collagen and elastin production in the skin. This helps to increase the skin's density, thickness, elasticity, and firmness. Collagen and elastin decrease as we age, so getting enough carotenoids in the diet and topically is critical for aging well.<br/><br/>Carotenoids can improve the signs of photoaging, skin discolouration, elasticity, hydration, texture, and can reduce transepidermal water loss.<br/><br/>Astaxanthin in particular stimulates fibroblasts to produce collagen and elastin, inhibits the activity of the enzymes that breakdown collagen and elastin, and shows anti-inflammatory and UV-filtering effects. It has been shown to reduce melanin in the skin, which results in the decrease in the appearance of freckles and melasma.<br/><br/>Anti-acne activity: the anti-inflammatory activity of carotenoids helps to dampen the inflammation and irritation associated with acne. Carotenoids also help to normalize and balance oil secretions from the sebaceous glands. They are valuable agents in skin repair and they stimulate epidermal regeneration, helping to smooth and soften skin.<br/><br/>Where Can I Find Carotenoids?<br/><br/>There are two ways to get your daily dose of carotenoids: through diet and through topical application. The combination of both is the ideal approach to well-aging skincare.<br/><br/>Carotenoids are fat-soluble, so your body needs fat to absorb them (think tomatoes and olive oil, broccoli and butter, or spinach and avocado). Common sources of carotenoids in food are avocado, egg yolks, kale, spinach, carrots, sweet potatoes, papaya, and tomatoes.<br/><br/>While we advocate getting as many of your nutrients and antioxidants as you can from food rather than supplementation; one study showed that astaxanthin combined with collagen hydrolysate significantly improved barrier integrity, reduced transepidermal water loss, and increased the expression of procollagen type I mRNA.<br/><br/>Topical application is key to healthy skin. Studies show that high concentrations of antioxidants in human skin offer the best protection for healthy skin at any age.<br/><br/>At Sarka Botanicals, we blend carotenoid-rich, whole plants such as calendula, dandelion, and extracts like astaxanthin with cold-pressed oils and functional ingredients. Calendula alone contains over 19 different types of carotenoids. This may explain why it has such a long history of use in skin care. Studies show that carotenoids blended with co-enzyme Q10 are especially effective at reducing inflammation and slowing premature skin aging due to sun exposure. | Fordelar med karotenoidar for huda<br/><br/>Har du høyrt om karotenoidar? Desse kraftige fytokjemikaliane er dei pigmenterte bestanddelane som finst i planter som gjev blomar, frukt og etterlater seg gule, oransje og raude fargar.<br/><br/>Sidan 1930-talet har forskarar identifisert om lag 800 karotenoidar og om lag 40 finst i menneskekroppen, inkludert det ytterste laget av epidermis, dermis og subkutant feitt. Dei vanlegaste karotenoidane er beta-karoten, alfa-karoten, lutein, zeaxanthin, lykopen og astaxanthin. Du kan lese meir om astaxanthin her.<br/><br/>Innhaldet av karotenoidar i huda er påverka av mange faktorar, mellom anna inntak av frukt og grønsaker, biotilgjengelegheit frå ulike matvarer, tilskudd, eksponering for UV-stråling, luftforureining, alkoholforbruk, røyking og stress.<br/><br/>Korleis hjelper karotenoidar huden min?<br/><br/>Karotenoidar er nokre av dei best kjende antioksidantane for huda, og dei har òg viktige funksjonar som antiinflammatoriske middel.<br/><br/>Sunn aldring og hudreparasjon<br/><br/>Antioksidantar er uunnværlege for sunn hud fordi dei hjelper til med å hindre skade på frie radikalar på cellene. Frie radikalar fører til for tidleg aldring og til at ulike typar hudkreft oppstår. Karotenoidar, saman med vitamin E, vitamin C og Co-enzym Q10, er viktige dermale antioksidantar.<br/><br/>På grunn av den antioksiderande aktiviteten støttar og oppmuntrar karotenoidane produksjonen av kollagen og elastin i huda. Dette hjelper til med å auka tettleiken, tjukkleiken, elastisiteten og fastleiken i huda. Kollagen og elastin minkar med alderen, så det å få i seg nok karotenoidar i kosten og topikalt er kritisk for å eldast godt.<br/><br/>Karotenoidar kan forbetra teikna på fotoaldring, misfarging av hud, elastisitet, hydrering, tekstur, og kan redusera transepidermalt vasstap.<br/><br/>Astaxanthin stimulerer særleg fibroblastar til å produsere kollagen og elastin, hemmer aktiviteten til enzyma som bryt ned kollagen og elastin, og viser antiinflammatoriske og UV-filtrerande effektar. Det har vist seg å redusere melanin i huda, noko som fører til redusert utsjånad av fregner og melasma.<br/><br/>Anti-akne aktivitet: Den anti-inflammatoriske aktiviteten til karotenoidar hjelper til med å dempa betennelsen og irritasjonen som er knytt til akne. Karotenoidar hjelper òg til med å normalisere og balansere oljesekresjon frå talgkjertlane. Dei er verdifulle middel i hudreparasjon og dei stimulerer epidermal regenerering, og hjelper til med å glatte ut og mjuke opp huda.<br/><br/>Kor finn eg karotenoidar?<br/><br/>Det er to måtar å få i seg den daglege dosen av karotenoidar på: gjennom kosten og ved lokal påføring. Kombinasjonen av desse er den ideelle måten å pleie huda på.<br/><br/>Karotenoidar er feittoppløyselege, så kroppen treng feitt for å ta opp dei (tenk tomatar og olivenolje, brokkoli og smør, eller spinat og avokado). Vanlege kjelder til karotenoidar i mat er avokado, eggeplomme, grønkål, spinat, gulrøtter, søtpotet, papaya og tomater.<br/><br/>Ein studie viste at astaxanthin i kombinasjon med kollagenhydrolysat forbetra barriereintegritet, reduserte transepidermalt vasstap og auka ekspresjonen av prokollagen type I mRNA.<br/><br/>Høge konsentrasjonar av antioksidantar i menneskehud gir best vern for sunn hud i alle aldrar.<br/><br/>Hos Sarka Botanicals blandar vi karotenoidrike, heilage planter som kalendula, løvetann og ekstraktar som astaxanthin med kaldpressa oljer og funksjonelle ingrediensar. Kalendula aleine inneheld over 19 ulike typar karotenoidar. Studier viser at karotenoidar blanda med koenzym Q10 er spesielt effektive for å redusere betennelse og forseinka for tidleg hudaldring på grunn av soleksponering. |
