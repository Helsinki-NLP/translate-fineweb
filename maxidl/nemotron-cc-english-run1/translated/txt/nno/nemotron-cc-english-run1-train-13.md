| Sleep Clinic<br/><br/>The sleep disorders program evaluates and treats children and adults affected by sleep-related problems such as insomnia, sleep apnea, narcolepsy and other hypersomnias, parasomnias and night time enuresis. The residents see patients during sleep disorders clinic hours.<br/><br/>During this rotation, the residents are exposed to a wide variety of sleep disorders. They are trained to investigate and evaluate their own patient care experiences pertaining to sleep evaluations with appraisal and assimilation of current scientific evidence. The residents work closely with sleep disorder faculty physicians and acquire the skills to formulate and communicate with patients and families about their diagnostic assessment and management plan, including neuropharmacology. Providing care plans to other physicians and care providers either verbally or via letter/note is an integral part of the program. | Søvnklinikk<br/><br/>Søvnforstyrringsprogrammet vurderer og behandlar barn og vaksne som er påverka av søvnrelaterte problem som søvnløshet, søvnapné, narkolepsi og andre hypersomniar, parasomniar og nattleg enurese. Innbyggjarane ser pasientar under søvnsjukdommar klinikktimar.<br/><br/>Under denne rotasjonen blir innbyggjarane utsett for ei rekkje ulike søvnlidingar. Dei er opplært til å undersøke og vurdere sine eigne pasientopplevingar i samband med søvnevalueringar med vurdering og assimilering av aktuell vitskapleg dokumentasjon. Innbyggjarane arbeider tett med søvnsjukdomslege og får kompetanse til å formulere og kommunisere med pasientar og familiar om sin diagnostiske vurderings- og styringsplan, inkludert nevrofarmakologi. Å tilby omsorgsplanar til andre legar og omsorgstilbod anten verbalt eller via brev/notat er ein integrert del av programmet. |
| Truly Handsfree Bluetooth Headset Takes Voice Commands<br/><br/>Most Bluetooth headsets are perfectly capable of the voice dial thing, assuming that the connected mobile phone can do it, but the BlueAnt V1 takes voice control to a new high. The incredibly compact Bluetooth headset is being marketed as the first ever with a true voice-based user interface.<br/><br/>Instead of clicking a physical button to answer your calls, you simply speak into the microphone and say "accept call". Other basic voice commands could include "volume up", "reject call", or "do the laundry". Okay, maybe it won't do that last thing, but you can see how a completely handsfree experience like that offered by the BlueAnt V1 can be excellent for drivers and other people who need their hands. That is why you're using a Bluetooth headset in the first place.<br/><br/>The downside is that the voice control can be "wonky" and it can be quite frustrating when you accidentally give it a command that you don't want it to do. What happens if you're in a call with someone and you happens to say "end call"? | Truleg handsfree Bluetooth-headset tek talekommandoar<br/><br/>Dei fleste Bluetooth-headset er fullt ut i stand til taleoppringings-tinget, og reknar med at den tilkopla mobiltelefonen kan gjere det, men BlueAnt V1 tek talestyringa til eit nytt høgdepunkt. Det utruleg kompakte Bluetooth-headsettet vert marknadsført som det første nokonsinne med eit sant stemmebasert brukargrensesnitt.<br/><br/>I staden for å trykkja på ein fysisk knapp for å svara på samtala, kan du rett og slett snakka inn i mikrofonen og seia «aksepter samtale». Andre grunnleggjande talekommandoar kan vera «volum opp», «avvis samtale» eller «ta oppvasken». Ok, kanskje det ikkje vil gjere det siste, men du kan sjå korleis ei heilt handsfree-oppleving som den som tilbys av BlueAnt V1 kan vere utmerket for førarar og andre som treng hendene sine. Difor brukar du i utgangspunktet eit Bluetooth-headset.<br/><br/>Ulempa er at talestyringa kan vere «wonky», og det kan vere ganske frustrerande når du ved eit uhell gir det ein kommando som du ikkje vil at det skal gjere. Kva om du er i ein samtale med nokon og du tilfeldigvis seier «slutt på samtalen»? |
| Wednesday, July 06, 2005<br/><br/>Going to college? DREAM on<br/><br/>Here is another great article about our failing (and increasingly ridiculous) immigration system, this time from the Boston Globe. A 18-year undocumented immigrant from Massachusetts was awarded a four-year scholarship at any state university because of her high test scores, but this was later rescinded once state officials found out about her immigration status. As the author of the article so rightly says,<br/><br/>"So much for celebrating the building blocks for success and the American dream. Romney says, tough luck if you are smart, hardworking, and the child of illegal immigrants."<br/><br/>It's beyond me why anyone wants to keep smart, high-achieving kids like this one out of college. Does anybody really think that denying in-state tuition and scholarships to undocumented immigrants will make any potential immigrants think twice about coming here to work? Or are policies like these motivated by fear? Despite the increasingly widespread movement in favor of the DREAM Act and state laws (see this previous post) to allow undocumented students to pay in-state tuition, it seems like the power of fear is growing.<br/><br/>It's interesting that Mass. Gov. Romney is bashing undocumented immigrants now - this article in the Economist shows how his campaign to end gay marriage in Massachusetts is closely linked to his anticipated run for the presidency in 2008. Here in New York, presumed Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton has gone to the right on immigration, claiming that she is "adamantly against illegal immigrants." It's unfortunate that the way to get ahead in politics (particularly in the red states) is to blame immigrants for our problems. It will be interesting to see if an increased Latino turnout in places like the Southwest will prove Hillary wrong.<br/><br/>3 comments:<br/><br/>Maybe people do not want illegal aliens to get scholarhips for the following reasons:<br/><br/>1. Their parents violated the law to enter the country. 2. Their parents had to steal someone's identity to work in this country. 3. Their parents have to cheat on their income taxes (and other taxes) to stay here. 4. Their parents had to lie to get their children admitted. 5. their parents lied on applications for things like free lunch.<br/><br/>First, the Supreme Court ruled in 1982 that all children have the right to public education regardless of immigration status. Schools are prohibited from asking about a child's immigration status, meaning that undocumented parents do not have to "lie" to get their kids free lunch.<br/><br/>Second, many immigrants do not have to use another identity or cheat on income taxes in order to work here -- many employers knowingly hire undocumented immigrants (this has been happening for some time - the 1986 Imm. Reform and Control Act's attempted to deal with it, and many anti-immigrant advocates argue that employer sanctions need to be strengthened today) and quite a few immigrants pay income taxes and other taxes that they never end up receiving the benefits of (the New York Times reported that illegal immigrants provide social security with a subsidy of $7 billion a year).<br/><br/>Finally, if the biggest problem with undocumented immigrants is that they are breaking the law by being here, should that same standard be applied to businesses that knowingly hire them (which, by the way, is also against the law even though it is rarely enforced)? Should the kids of these businesspeople be denied the same opportunities because their parents broke the law? Could we extend this argument to the children of everyone who has ever broken the law in this country?<br/><br/>Whatever you think about illegal immigration, the point is that the kids should not be punished for their parents' decisions to come here. Especially when these bright and hardworking undocumented students have the potential to contribute so much to our society. | Hendingar for 6. juli 2019 › Folkemusikk<br/><br/>Skal du på college? DREAM on<br/><br/>Her er ein annan flott artikkel om vårt sviktande (og stadig meir latterlige) innvandringssystem, denne gongen frå Boston Globe. Ein 18 år gammal uokumentert immigrant frå Massachusetts fekk eit fireårig stipend ved eit statsuniversitet på grunn av dei høge testresultata sine, men dette vart seinare oppheva då statlege embetsmenn fann ut om innvandringsstatusen hennar. Som forfattaren av artikkelen så med rette seier:<br/><br/>«Så mykje for å feire byggsteinane for suksess og den amerikanske draumen», seier Romney, «vanskeleg flaks om du er smart, hardtarbeidande og barn av illegale immigrantar.»<br/><br/>Det er forbigåande for meg kvifor nokon ynskjer å halde smarte, høgt oppnådde born som denne ut av college. Er det nokon som verkeleg trur at å nekta statleg undervisning og stipend til papirlause immigrantar vil få nokon potensielle immigrantar til å tenkje seg om to gonger før dei kjem hit for å jobbe? Eller er politikk som desse motivert av frykt? Trass i den stadig meir utbreidde rørsla til fordel for DREAM Act og statlege lover (sjå dette førre innlegget) for å tillate udokumenterte studentar å betale undervisning i staten, ser det ut til at makta til frykta aukar.<br/><br/>Det er interessant at masseguvernør Romney bastar udokumenterte immigrantar no - denne artikkelen i The Economist syner korleis hans kampanje for å få slutt på homofile ekteskap i Massachusetts er nært knytt til hans forventa presidentkandidatur i 2008. Her i New York har den påståtte demokratiske frontkøyraren Hillary Clinton gått til høgre om innvandring, og hevda at ho er «adamant mot illegale immigrantar». Det er uheldig at måten å komme seg framover i politikken (særleg i dei raude delstatane) er å klandre immigrantane for problema våre. Det blir interessant å sjå om ein auka Latino-deltaking på stader som Sørvest vil vise at Hillary tar feil.<br/><br/>No Alltid koselig med ein kommentar.<br/><br/>Kanskje folk ikkje vil at ulovlege utlendingar skal få stipend av følgjande grunnar:<br/><br/>1. Foreldra deira brøyt lova for å kome inn i landet. 2. Foreldra deira måtte stele identiteten til nokon for å arbeide her i landet. 3. Foreldra deira må jukse med inntektsskatten (og andre skattar) for å bli verande her. 4. Foreldra deira måtte lyge for å få borna sine innlagte. 5. Foreldra deira løy om søknadar om ting som gratis lunsj.<br/><br/>Først avgjorde Høgsterett i 1982 at alle barn har rett til offentleg utdanning uavhengig av innvandringsstatus. Skular har forbod mot å spørje om eit barns innvandringsstatus, det vil seia at papirlause foreldre ikkje treng å «lyve» for å få barna sine gratis lunsj.<br/><br/>For det andre treng ikkje mange innvandrarar å bruke ein annan identitet eller jukse med inntektsskatt for å kunne arbeide her - mange arbeidsgivarar leier med vitende og vilje inn papirlause innvandrarar (dette har skjedd ei tid - Imm i 1986. Reform- og kontrolllova har forsøkt å handsame det, og mange antiinnvandrarforkjemparar argumenterer for at arbeidsgjevarsanksjonar må styrkast i dag) og ganske mange innvandrarar betaler inntektsskatt og andre skattar som dei aldri ender opp med å motta stønadene av (New York Times rapporterte at ulovlege innvandrarar gjev trygd med eit tilskot på 7 milliardar dollar i året).<br/><br/>Til slutt, dersom det største problemet med papirlause innvandrarar er at dei bryt lova ved å vere her, bør same standard gjelde for verksemder som vitjar dei (som forresten òg er imot lova sjølv om ho sjeldan blir handheva)? Skal borna til desse forretningsfolka bli nekta dei same moglegheitene fordi foreldra deira har brote lova? Kan vi utvida dette argumentet til borna til alle som nokon gong har brote lova i dette landet?<br/><br/>Uansett kva du meiner om ulovleg innvandring, er poenget at borna ikkje skal straffast for at foreldra sine vedtak kjem hit. Særleg når desse lyssterke og hardtarbeidande papirlause studentane har potensial til å bidra så mykje til samfunnet vårt. |
| this states that it was the Flu during the PO's and while I know that teams mask/hide injuries, this one wasn't bad at all considering he missed 1 game during the PO's.<br/><br/>You may have this injury mixed up with someone else.<br/><br/>Yea...sure "flu"..and Thornton had flu too. I don't know if you watched playoffs but it was indeed concussion...I sure did. he was hit pretty hard by Begin and wasn't the same after this. He was laying on the ice for quite a while and didn't play the next game | Denne stadfestar at det var influensa under PO'en og medan eg veit at lag maskerer/gjemmer skadar, var denne ikkje dårleg i det heile tatt med tanke på at han gjekk glipp av 1 kamp under PO'en.<br/><br/>Du kan ha denne skaden samanblanda med nokon andre.<br/><br/>Ja...sikkert "influensa"....og Thornton hadde influensa òg. Eg veit ikkje om du såg playoffs, men det var faktisk hjernerystelse... det gjorde eg. Han vart ganske hardt råka av Begin og var ikkje den same etter dette.

| ΑΛΗΘΩΣ<br/><br/>Corporations are not people and money is not speech<br/><br/>In Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned century-old restrictions on corporate spending in elections under the guise of protecting First Amendment free speech rights. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, writing for the majority, said, "If the First Amendment has any force, it prohibits Congress from fining or jailing citizens, or associations of citizens, for simply engaging in political speech." This argument of the majority decision rests on the notions that corporations are covered by the same free speech protections as individual citizens and that campaign donations or financing are the same as speech.<br/><br/>Corporations, however, are inherently not the same as individuals and thus cannot have the same protections as individuals. There are a slew of laws that protect corporations and their interests in the arena for which they are by definition formed—namely the marketplace. The laws that govern corporations and the rights enjoyed by them are distinct from the laws and rights of individuals. A corporation, for example, can enter into contracts like an individual, but unlike an individual, a corporation's members can be protected by limited liability so their personal assets are not at stake.<br/><br/>If a corporation, then, is a distinct legal entity governed by different laws than an individual is, corporations are not protected under the First Amendment in the same way that individuals are protected. Corporations, especially in their most powerful and wealthy incarnations, are exponentially more influential than most individuals in America. The restrictions on corporate spending in elections that were overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court were meant to redress this power balance between average individuals and unduly influential businesses. Corporations already have a plethora of ways to influence politics, from political action committees to lobbyists on Capitol Hill. The framers of the Bill of Rights wanted to protect the voices of the trampled, not amplify the voices of the elite.<br/><br/>The other part of the Supreme Court's premise for its decision is that the First Amendment free speech clause applies to campaign funding. While speech can be interpreted loosely as any form of expression, such an open, ambiguous definition would create a myriad of problems with all kinds of laws. An architect has a vision of a building: it is his art, his self expression, yet he cannot ignore local zoning laws that, for instance, restrict the height of his building. Should he sue the state for violation of his free speech, his right to expression? Equating money with speech also opens the door to sundry ludicrous claims by, for instance, an employer who objects to minimum wage laws since he'd like to express that his employees are only worth paying $3 an hour. There have to be restrictions on what constitutes speech to prevent a bastardization of the term and an overly liberal interpretation of the First Amendment.<br/><br/>A corporation already has the power to issue a statement in favor of a candidate or policy through its political action committees, and individual members of a business are welcome to contribute money as well. However, allowing a corporation to use its vast profits to directly finance the election or to remove a candidate compromises the democratic notion of a free and fair election. There are unseemly ties even now between politicians and various industries, but this new ruling would make such connections more robust and give them a veneer of legitimacy. A politician financed by a business would become completely beholden to its political agenda and not to the voters.<br/><br/>It's not only the independence of politicians that's at stake, but also the independence of our judges, who are at the very least expected to be impartial. Many states still use elections to appoint judges, which leaves them vulnerable to the influence of political spending. In a recent speech at a law school conference, former Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor worried about the impact of corporate campaign funding in judicial elections, saying that "judicial campaigning makes last week's decision in Citizens United an increasing problem for maintaining an independent judiciary."<br/><br/>Two cornerstones of our democracy—free elections and an independent judiciary—are threatened by the Supreme Court's activist and meddling decision. The case could have been decided much more narrowly in favor of Citizens United, but instead, the majority of the justices decided to expand the case to champion the rights of big money over the interest of the American people. Senators Dick Durbin (D-IL) and Arlen Specter (D-PA) introduced the Fair Elections Now Act last March. It would prohibit contributions from political action committees and would match individual donations, limited to $100, on a 4:1 basis so that fundraising focuses on the people. Such a system has been in place in New York City since the 1988 Campaign Finance Act. The rest of the country is long overdue to follow. Never before has the fight for public financing been more necessary.<br/><br/>The author is a Columbia College junior majoring in political science. She is a prospective law student.<br/><br/>The 14th amendment, which was one of the Reconstruction amendments added following the War of Northern Aggression was never legally ratified by the States and has caused more problems than all the other post-war amendments combined. If my memory serves me right, corporations were declared by the Supreme Court to be 14th Amemdment citizens during the late 1800s or early 1900s. In case you are unfamiliar with the wording of this amendment, it basically made everyone a citizen (and subject) of the United States. Prior to the War, all individuals were citizens of the State within which they resided and no one was a citizen of the United States nor were they subject to the jurisdiction of the United States except for those who resided in the District of Columbia or resided within one of the territories under the jurisdiction of the United States. The main purposes of the War of Northern Aggression was to destroy the soverienty of the individual States and reduce the status of every American to that of a subject under the control and jurisdiction of the United States government. The founding fathers set up our government as a loose confederation of Sovereign States with the States exercising all meaningful polical power. They never invisioned or intended any effective political power to reside in Washington. Things will only get much worse until We the People throw the theives and money changers out of Washington and restore our government back to what it once was.<br/><br/>The word person means corporation in law. It is not that corporations are not people, it is that people are not corporations. We have been tricked into accepting a corporate identity[ALL CAPS]. Look at your drivers license. Every time we go to court,we go as a corporation, not as a natural person.The first corporations were governments. Looked at logically, limited liability for a corporation is the extension of sovereign immunity to the king after he was no longer king. The same ruling elite families are still in control and that goes all the way back to the first known about extraterrestrials[anunaki] that the Sumerian documents talk about.The same group also take the credit or blame for all the religions and secret societies.<br/><br/>What difference does it make? Really. Think about it, the whole entire Congress and Senate are a dog and pony show, the real power brokers who control it all are in the shadows, working the deals, doing what they want, with the AL-CIA-DA and MOSSAD out there killing everyone who disagrees with these shadow government assholes who truly run it all.<br/><br/>So, why is it so important now to be so upset over this shit? Why now? After more than two hundred years of absolute proof that the politicians are just a fancy hand puppet show to distract us from the REAL WHEELING AND DEALING IN THE BACK ROOMS elsewhere, why does it matter now that the total contempt of democracy is being demonstrated by SCOTUS in this ruling? The assholes on this court know that the real guys with their hands on the power levers of the system aren't in the Congress and the Senate.<br/><br/>When the Rule of Law became OBSOLETE in the world, in general, and everything became more or less ROLLERBALL only this time, on STEROIDS, for and by the CORPORATIONS, why did this sole ruling make all that much difference? Why do all of you assholes think that this 'lagging' indicator of the end of any semblances of democratic government makes any difference.<br/><br/>Hypothetically, let's say this ruling had not happened. Do any of you think that the corporations and the moneyed influences in the shadows wouldn't have continued to exert any and all of their will on the rest of us?<br/><br/>For those of you who think it'd been different, I suggest you find a remedy to your TOTAL NAIVETE!!!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>this ruling didn't make one iota of a difference. It was always like this, long before SCOTUS basically said to corporations; "go ahead, do what the fuck you want…the little people are just cannon fodder for your wars, chattel for you to barter and sell at your leisure.."<br/><br/>democracy was always an illusion. We never ever had any control, ever. making such a mountain out of this mole hill is absolutely unwarranted, in light of the fact that for the whole entire 230 year history of this republic, the fat cats and the rich oligarchs never needed any Congress or Senate to do what they pleased, under any circumstances, ever. They just did it.<br/><br/>The government you were looking at was a chimera, not real..<br/><br/>the sooner you all come to that realization, the sooner we can get on with less pissing and moaning over a mere joke of a technicality that was always the case from day one, and was not foisted on us by the SCOTUS, the court only quite belatedly declared to us what has been happening for a long long long, corrupt time.<br/><br/>I've got a mad crush on Exxon, and Exxon has one on me, wedding bells in the spring – a bit quick I know, but our love can't be denied. Exxon is a little shy, so don't expect any public announcements, we're thinking a quiet wedding in Reno.<br/><br/>Any business is simply a group of individuals (small or large) exercising their individual rights collectively. Therefore, any business has the same rights as those individuals (except, of course, the right to vote, which is reserved to the individuals themselves). The freedom to dispose of one's wealth as one sees fit comes along with the freedom to earn it. If an aggregate of individuals has earned money, it should be free to decide how do dispose of that money. The real problem is not that businesses can donate to campaigns, it is that the government has been allowed to meddle in business – i.e. that the government can grant some favor in return for that money. We need separation of commerce and state in the same way and for the same reasons as we have separation of church and state. I also find it interesting that the author chose as examples two laws (zoning and minimum wage) that also violate individual rights. The first violates property rights and the second violates the rights of individuals to contract freely.<br/><br/>under your jackoffian analysis, nobody should interfere with anything anyone does at all. say, if I were in a crowd, with a saturday night special, and I want to 'free speech' your butt with it much in the same way the CIA free speeched Bobby Kennedy in L.A. one night, that's fine, because to interfere with me is interfering with my right to free speech you.<br/><br/>that's the critical flaw with you libertarian assholes….you think that there is no societal role for any rule of law, that anything that fits under 'ends justify means' rationale shouldn't ever be interfered with, just let everyone do whatever they so choose, and it all works out. That Ayn Rand bullshit doesn't work, dude! It works right up to the point where someone else pays a price for your 'whatever i wanna do' freedom crosses a line and then interfere with my freedom.<br/><br/>rules and laws SHOULD exist in the framework of society strictly to keep in check that good old "I can do anything I want to and it's just me being free" line of horse shit.<br/><br/>Corporations do not have any rights, dorkus! globally, they have been the reason why there are so many failed states, pillaged by the will of corporatocrats based in the U.S.S.A. who think that freedom of their speech translates into; "do what we tell you or we'll bomb you to get your resources we need" kind of raping and pillaging.<br/><br/>someday, I hope some asshole fucks you with their 'free speech' and then we'll hear your sorry ass whine about how the law let you down. What law? In your libertarian world of 'I can do what I want', the only rule of law is the one you make up to justify your end goal. For you then, it'll be fun to see how you cope with some other asshole's interpretation of your boundary being just a little bit of a mere inconvenience for his goals, which didn't necessarily respect your boundaries at all, for damned sure!<br/><br/>Someone by the name of "uh huh, right.." might have a logical point hidden in the forest of name-calling and straw-man abuse, but how about this: Corporations are inventions of the State that are created to pass some of the risks of doing business from the people running the business over to the stockholders (if any), the customers (if any) and the public. So if a corporation commits a fraud, it is the corporation that's punished (usually) and fined and the people who run the corporation get to walk away with a golden handshake. And the cost of the fine is passed along to the customers and paid to the government (not the victims!). To "David"s point, if we were to separate government and commerce, corporations would cease to exist! Not a bad idea.<br/><br/>I think that the point is, that if a corporation commits a financial crime, and nobody notices (the if the tree falls in the forest and nobody hears it, did it truly make a noise argument) then did a crime actually take place?<br/><br/>and in a veitch diagram, where the two blobs collide and interact, if one encroaches on the other one's boundary, who is the arbiter of who got violated?<br/><br/>my point is this: there are no straw man arguments with regard to david's asinine assessment that corporations can do whatever they want with abandon. the truth of the matter is, granting corporations, and oligarchs, or whomever, a license to do what they want, whenever they want, under the premise that THEY ARE INDIVIDUALS and hence, guaranteed FREE SPEECH, is both absurd and horse shit.<br/><br/>corporations are made up of groups of people. people who should live by some semblance of Rule of Law. When they don't have to, then it's "I can do anything I want as long as nobody catches me or holds me accountable for my transgressions" going on here.<br/><br/>if that's the world David wants to live in, let him go there and make it happen, but goddamn it, don't expect me not to fucking object to that shit!<br/><br/>We can all get along, just as long as boundaries are not gratuitously violated at will by anyone who thinks their right to do what they want actually nullifies my right not to be interfered with by their actions.<br/><br/>with regard to corporations, they have no right to violate my rights, or yours, or anyone elses. If they can't function in the community as a benevolent and hence, non interfering entity, then they have no right to exist.<br/><br/>and David wasn't being threatened. he's an asshole for asserting that "do what you want, it's freedom of speech" is a bunch of horse shit. It's la la land bullshit. And I object to anyone or anything violating my boundaries with that free speech assertion. That's a crock of shit and you know it is!<br/><br/>Well, that was a colorful response. Sadly, "uh-uh", you are way off the mark. I never said people have the right to infringe on anyone else's rights…and I repudiate "ends justify the means" thinking. Yes, laws SHOULD exist, but ONLY to PROTECT the rights of people. I'm sorry you have such a warped and horribly incorrect view of my argument.<br/><br/>your point well taken, David. I apologize for peeing in your corn flakes. I think I thought you were inferring that corporations were able to do whatever they pleased under this right of FREEDOM OF SPEECH, which in Amerk'a is a joke today because the PATRIOT ACT and a non-declared state of MARTIAL LAW we've been living under since Sept. 2001, has given the government the ability to suspend and or 'shred' the U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights.<br/><br/>sadly, people have only a few rights. we have the right to be taxed to the point of absurdity. we have the right to be conscripted and become cannon fodder for oligarch wars. and we have the right to shut the fuck up and be quiet while we are being joy boinked by corporations and oligarchs and bankers. those are our rights, and sadly, they truly SUCKETH, David. I think we can agree on that!<br/><br/>I'm still wondering how the newbie, Roberts, inherited the Chief Justiceship after Rhenquist rather than that role going to someone with more experience on the bench. What does "The Roberts Court" plan to do next, though, for corporations? Give them the right to vote at the polls like real people?; perhaps have votes by human beings counted as 3/5 of a person or less to their 1?<br/><br/>I haven't read all of the 183-page booklength "ruling" yet but find these appalling statements therein to be not only contradictory to their expansive actions in this case but also something of an abdication of their duty:<br/><br/>"the gravest and most delicate duty that this Court is called upon to perform." Blodgett v. Holden, 275 U. S. 142, 147–148 (1927) (Holmes, J., concurring). Because the stakes are so high, our standard practice is to refrain from addressing constitutional questions except when necessary to rule on particular claims before us. See Ashwander v. TVA, 297 U. S. 288, 346–348 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concur-ring). This policy underlies both our willingness to construe ambiguous statutes to avoid constitutional problems and our practice "'never to formulate a rule of constitutional law broader than is required by the precise facts to which it is to be applied.'" United States v. Raines, 362<br/>U. S. 17, 21 (1960) (quoting Liverpool, New York & Philadelphia S. S. Co. v. Commissioners of Emigration, 113<br/>U. S. 33, 39 (1885)).<br/>The majority and dissent are united in expressing allegiance to these principles. Ante, at 12; post, at 14 (STEVENS, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). >><br/><br/>Roberts, by virtue of his lies during CONfirmation by the DEMS who shoved his lying ass thru the process at mach speed, needs to be 'impeached' for being a fucking liar. He specifically stated he would not go this route of writing decisions not based on settled, non controversial concepts of the U.S. Constitution…and here clearly he has done exactly the opposite of that.<br/><br/>The real blame should be on the shoulders of the cocksuckers in the SENATE that confirmed the son of a bitch in the first place, stating they wouldn't vote against his confirmation because they were saving their ammo for REAL THREATS TO US..<br/><br/>I blame the fucking DINOCRATS more than I blame this lying pile of shit named Roberts. Pricks like SCHUMER and that other asshole from Illinois, and that lying zionist bastard Levin from Michigan. Just a couple of them holding their ground could have stopped the confirmation of Alito, and then Roberts. But they let it slide.<br/><br/>the assertion that all of this is indeed window dressing is a correct one, and the truth is, though blatantly a violation of our rights across the board, these scum in the SCOTUS are only post fact, asserting the screwing they were doing to us for a long, long, long time.<br/><br/>the truth is, it never mattered what we thought was going on, because Corporations have been functioning well outside the law for a long time now, and nobody has held them accountable. the very bastards that sit on the SCOTUS are benefactors of the wrongdoing and greed of the corporations who provide kickbacks to them for their decisions, in the form of STOCK DIVIDENDS.<br/><br/>unfortunately, focusing on the corrupt SCOTUS doesn't help us much. It's like stating the obvious, and expecting it to be punishable, when it is not.<br/><br/>we are fucked no matter how we look at it, but there will be a day of atonement. Once they take away every last vestige of personal dignity of the entire middle class in this country, there will be hell to pay.

Sounds like Treason to me.<br/><br/>In my own idea and understanding there have to be restrictions on what constitutes speech to prevent a bastardization of the term and an overly liberal interpretation of the First Amendment..Great post!!<br/><br/>4 We need not reach the question whether the Government has a compelling interest in preventing foreign individuals or associations from influencing our Nation's political process. Cf. 2 U. S. C. §441e (contribution and expenditure ban applied to "foreign national[s]"). Section 441b is not limited to corporations or associations that were created in foreign countries or funded predominantly by foreign shareholders. Section 441b therefore would be overbroad even if we assumed, arguendo, that the Government has a compelling interest in limiting foreign influence over our political process. See Broadrick, 413<br/>U. S., at 615. >><br/><br/>The US went bankrupt when FDR called in the gold. We had no more gold to pay for the paper we borrowed from the FED. It is now in a yearly bankruptcy rollover. The government is now private like BLACKWATER. All government agencies are listed on DUNN AND BRADSTREET. The common law which the constitution specifies pertains to natural people. All business by the courts today is corporate meaning that we are viewed as individual corporations. We exist by contract with the state. Remember the 14th amendment. There were no US citizens before that. Most of us have unwittingly claimed US corporate citizenship. We need to address the rule by the banking elite.Almost all leading REPS and DEMS are members of the COUNCIL OF FOREIGN RELATIONS or the TLC. LOok up the history of who started and controls these. Rush, Glenn and Sean are all liars and banker bootlickers. Obama is a puppet for the CFR. 911 truth has a great deal more bearing and would serve to unite the honest people in this country.<br/><br/>I don't really believe I'm a corporation or the citizen of one but, if the gubbermint thinks so, does the SCOTUS ruling mean that there are no more campaign contribution limits on anyone, businesses or individuals? I'd rather see money removed from our electoral process altogether — equal time on America's airwaves given at no charge for all candidates | ΑΛΗΘΩΣ<br/><br/>Korporasjonar er ikkje menneske og pengar er ikkje tale<br/><br/>I Citizens United mot Federal Election Commission, omgjorde den amerikanske høgsteretten fleire hundre år gamle restriksjonar på selskapsutgifter i val under dekke av å verne om ytringsfridom i First Amendment. Dommar Anthony M. Kennedy, som skreiv for majoriteten, sa: «Dersom det første grunnlovstillegget har nokon kraft, forbyr det Kongressen frå å bøtelegge eller fengsla borgarar, eller assosiasjonar av borgarar, for berre å engasjere seg i politisk tale.» Dette argumentet for fleirtalsvedtaket ligg i forestillinga om at selskap er dekte av det same ytringsfridomsvernet som individuelle borgarar, og at kampanjegåver eller finansiering er det same som tale.<br/><br/>Korporasjonar er derimot i seg sjølv ikkje det same som individ, og kan dermed ikkje ha same vern som individ. Det finst ei rekkje lover som vernar selskapa og interessene deira på den arenaen dei per definisjon er utforma for – nemleg marknadsplassen. Dei lovene som styrer selskapa og dei rettane dei har, skil seg frå lovene og rettane til enkeltpersonar. Eit aksjeselskap kan til dømes inngå kontraktar som eit individ, men i motsetnad til eit individ kan medlemmene i eit aksjeselskap vere verna av avgrensa ansvar slik at dei personlege eigedomane deira ikkje står på spel.<br/><br/>Dersom eit aksjeselskap da er ei tydeleg juridisk eining styrt av andre lover enn eit individ er, er ikkje selskap verna etter første endring på same måte som individ er verna. Korporasjonar, særleg i sine mektigaste og rikaste inkarnasjonar, er eksponentielt meir innverknadsrike enn dei fleste individ i Amerika. Restriksjonane på selskapsutgifter i val som vart velta av USAs høgsterett var meint å rette opp denne maktbalansen mellom gjennomsnittlege individ og utilbørleg innverknadsrike verksemder. Korporasjonane har allereie ei mengd ulike måtar å påverke politikken på, frå politiske aksjonskomitear til lobbyistar på Capitol Hill. Dei som utforma Bill of Rights ønskte å verne røystene til dei som vart trampa ned, ikkje forsterke røystene til eliten.<br/><br/>Den andre delen av Høgsterett sin premiss for avgjerda er at ytringsfridomsklausulen i First Amendment gjeld for kampanjefinansiering. Tale kan laust tolkast som alle former for uttrykk, men ein slik open, tvetydig definisjon ville skapt eit mylder av problem med alle slags lover. Ein arkitekt har ein visjon om ein bygning: det er kunsten hans, sjølvuttrykket hans, likevel kan han ikkje oversjå lokale reguleringslover som til dømes avgrensar høgda på bygningen hans.Skal han saksøke staten for brot på ytringsfridomen, ytringsretten sin? Likestilling av pengar med tale opnar òg døra for diverse latterlige krav frå til dømes ein arbeidsgjevar som motsetter seg minstelønnslover sidan han gjerne vil uttrykkje at arbeidstakarane hans berre er verd å betale 3 dollar i timen. Det må vere restriksjonar på kva som utgjer tale for å hindre ei bastardisering av uttrykket og ei altfor liberal tolking av det første grunnlovstillegget.<br/><br/>Eit aksjeselskap har allereie makt til å gje ei fråsegn til fordel for ein kandidat eller politikk gjennom sine politiske aksjonskomitear, og einskilde medlemer av eit føretak er òg velkomne til å bidra med pengar. Men å tillate eit selskap å bruke sin enorme profitt til direkte å finansiere valet eller å fjerne ein kandidat, kompromitterer den demokratiske oppfatninga av eit fritt og rettferdig val. Det er usømmelege band sjølv no mellom politikarar og ulike industriar, men dette nye vedtaket vil gjere slike samband meir robuste og gje dei ei fane av legitimitet. Ein politikar som er finansiert av ei verksemd, vil bli heilt oppteken av den politiske agendaen sin og ikkje av veljarane.<br/><br/>Det er ikkje berre sjølvstende for politikarane som står på spel, men òg sjølvstende for våre dommarar, som i det minste er forventa å vere upartiske. Mange statar nyttar framleis val til å utnemna dommarar, noko som gjer dei sårbare for påverknad frå politiske utgifter. I ein nyleg tale på ein jusskonferanse, var tidlegare Høgsterettsdommar Sandra Day O'Connor uroa for påverknaden av korporativ kampanjefinansiering i rettslege val, og sa at «judisiell kampanje gjer forrige vekes vedtak i Citizens United til eit aukande problem for å oppretthalde eit uavhengig rettsvesen.»<br/><br/>To hjørnesteinar i demokratiet vårt – frie val og eit uavhengig rettsvesen – er truga av Høgsteretts aktivist- og innblandingsvedtak. Saka kunne ha vorte avgjort mykje meir snevert til fordel for Citizens United, men i staden bestemte fleirtalet av dommarane seg for å utvide saka for å meistere rettane til store pengar over interessene til det amerikanske folket. Senatorane Dick Durbin (D-IL) og Arlen Specter (D-PA) innførte Fair Elections Now Act i mars i fjor. Det ville forby bidrag frå politiske aksjonskomitear og ville matche individuelle donasjonar, avgrensa til $100, på 4:1 basis slik at innsamlinga fokuserte på folket. Eit slikt system har vore på plass i New York City sidan 1988 Campaign Finance Act. Resten av landet er lenge for seint å følgje. Aldri før har kampen for offentleg finansiering vore meir naudsynt.<br/><br/>Forfattaren er ein Columbia College junior med hovudfag i statsvitskap.<br/><br/>Den 14. endringa, som var ein av dei rekonstruksjonsendringane som vart lagt til etter den nordlege aggresjonskrigen, vart aldri rettsleg ratifisert av statane, og har ført til fleire problem enn alle dei andre etterkrigsendringane til saman. Om eg hugsar rett, vart korporasjonar av Høgsterett erklærte som 14. endringsborgarar seint på 1800-talet eller tidleg på 1900-talet. I tilfelle du ikkje er kjend med ordlyden i denne endringa, gjorde det i utgangspunktet alle til ein statsborgar (og emne) i USA. Før krigen var alle personane statsborgarar i den staten dei budde i, og ingen av dei var statsborgarar i USA, og dei var heller ikkje underlagt jurisdiksjonen til USA, bortsett frå dei som budde i District of Columbia eller som budde i eit av territoria under jurisdiksjonen til USA. Hovudføremålet med den nordlege aggresjonskrigen var å øydeleggje suvereniteten til dei einskilde statane og redusere statusen til alle amerikanarar til eit emne under kontroll og jurisdiksjon av den amerikanske regjeringa. Grunnleggjarane oppretta regjeringa vår som ein laus konføderasjon av suverene statar med statane som utøvde all meiningsfull politisk makt. Dei insisterte aldri på eller meinte at nokon effektiv politisk makt skulle vere i Washington. Ting vil berre bli mykje verre fram til We the People kastar tjuvane og pengevekslarane ut av Washington og gjenopprettar regjeringa vår tilbake til det ho ein gong var.<br/><br/>Ordet person tyder selskap i loven. Det er ikkje at selskap ikkje er folk, det er at folk ikkje er selskap. Vi har blitt lurt til å godta ein selskapsidentitet[ALL CAPS]. Sjå på førerkortet ditt. Kvar gong vi går til retten, går vi som eit aksjeselskap, ikkje som ein fysisk person. Dei første aksjeselskapa var regjeringar. Ser ein logisk på avgrensa ansvar for eit aksjeselskap er utvidinga av suveren immunitet til kongen etter at han ikkje lenger var konge. Dei same styringselitfamiliane er framleis i kontroll, og det går heilt tilbake til den første kjende om utenomjordiske[anunaki] som dei sumeriske dokumenta snakkar om. Den same gruppa tek òg æra eller skulda for alle religionane og dei hemmelege samfunna.<br/><br/>Kva spelar det for rolle? Tenk på det, heile Kongressen og Senatet er eit hunde- og ponnishow, dei verkelege maktmeklarane som kontrollerer alt er i skuggene, arbeider med avtalene, gjer det dei vil, med AL-CIA-DA og MOSSAD der ute som drep alle som er usamde med desse skugge-regjerings-drittsekkene som verkeleg styrer alt.<br/><br/>Så, kvifor er det så viktig no å vere så opprørt over denne dritten? Kvifor no? Etter meir enn to hundre år med absolutte bevis på at politikarane berre er eit fancy hand-marionet-show for å distrahere oss frå REAL WHEELING AND DEALING IN THE BACK ROOMS andre stader, kvifor spelar det no noko rolle at den totale forakta for demokratiet blir demonstrert av SCOTUS i denne avgjersla? Røvarane på denne domstolen veit at dei verkelege karane med hendene på maktspakane i systemet ikkje er i Kongressen og Senatet.<br/><br/>Då rettsregelen blei OBSOLET i verda, generelt, og alt blei meir eller mindre ROLLERBALL berre denne gongen, på STEROIDER, for og av SELSKAP, kvifor gjorde denne eineretten så stor skilnad? Kvifor trur alle de idiotane at denne 'lagging' indikatoren på slutten av nokon form for demokratisk regjering gjer noko forskjell.<br/><br/>Hypotetisk sett, lat oss seie at dette ikkje hadde skjedd, trur nokon av dykk at selskapa og dei pengepengane i skuggen ikkje ville ha halde fram med å utøve all sin vilje på resten av oss?<br/><br/>For dei av dykk som trur det hadde vore annleis, foreslår eg at du finn eit botemiddel til din TOTAL NAIVETE!!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>Denne domsavgjerda gjorde ikkje ein einaste skilnad. Det var alltid slik, lenge før SCOTUS i utgangspunktet sa til selskapa; «gå vidare, gjer kva faen du vil...de små folka er berre kanonføde for krigane dine, snakkar for deg til å bytte og selje på fritida di.».<br/><br/>Demokratiet har alltid vore ein illusjon, vi har aldri hatt kontroll, nokon gong. Å lage eit slikt fjell ut av denne moloen er absolutt uberettiget, i lys av det faktum at for heile den 230 år lange historia til denne republikken, treng ikkje feite kattar og rike oligarkar nokon kongress eller senat for å gjere det dei ønskjer, under nokon omstendighet, nokon gong. Dei gjorde nettopp det.<br/><br/>Regjeringa du såg på var ein kimære, ikkje ekte..<br/><br/>Jo før de alle innser det, jo før vi kan komme videre med mindre pissing og stønning over ein enkel vits om ein teknikk som alltid var tilfelle frå dag ein, og som ikkje vart påtvungen oss av SCOTUS, kun ganske seint forklarte retten for oss kva som har skjedd i lang, lang, lang, korrupt tid.<br/><br/>Eg har ein galen forelskelse i Exxon, og Exxon har ein på meg, bryllaupsklokker om våren – litt kjapt veit eg, men kjærleiken vår kan ikkje nektast. Exxon er litt sjenert, så ikkje forvent offentlege kunngjeringar, me tenkjer på eit roleg bryllaup i Reno.<br/><br/>Alle føretak er rett og slett ei gruppe individ (små eller store) som utøvar sine individuelle rettar kollektivt. Alle føretak har difor dei same rettane som enkeltindivid (med unnatak av sjølvsagt stemmeretten, som er reservert for enkeltindivida sjølve). Fridomen til å råde over eigedomen sin slik ein ser det høver seg, kjem i lag med fridomen til å tena han. Dersom eit aggregat av personar har tent pengar, bør det vere opp til dei sjølve å bestemme korleis dei skal disponere desse pengane. Det verkelege problemet er ikkje at bedrifter kan donere til kampanjer, men at styresmaktene har fått lov til å blande seg inn i næringslivet – det vil seia at styresmaktene kan gje noko gunst i retur for dei pengane. Vi treng skilje mellom handel og stat på same måte og av same grunn som vi har skilje mellom kyrkje og stat. Eg synest det er interessant at forfattaren som døme valde to lover (sonering og minstelønn) som òg krenkjer individet sine rettar. Den første krenkjer eigedomsretten og den andre krenkjer den enkelte sin rett til å inngå frie kontraktar.<br/><br/>« Eg vil ikkje at nokon skal koma og gjera noko vondt mot deg », sa du, « for du har ikkje lyst til å gjera noko med noko som helst. » Eg seier, om eg var i ein folkemengde, med ein lørdag kveld spesiell, og eg vil 'tale fritt' rumpeballen din med det mykje på same måte som CIA frigjorde Bobby Kennedy i L.A. ein kveld, det er greit, fordi å forstyrre meg er å forstyrre min rett til ytringsfridom du.<br/><br/>Det er den kritiske feilen med deg libertarianske rasshøl.... du meiner at det ikkje er nokon samfunnsrolle for noko rettsstyre, at alt som passar inn under 'endeleg rettferdiggjer middel' rasjonale aldri bør bli forstyrra, berre la alle gjere som dei vil, og det fungerer. At Ayn Rand-tullet ikkje funkar, mann! Det funkar heilt opp til det punktet der nokon andre betaler ein pris for din "hva enn eg vil" -fridom kryssar ei grense og så forstyrrar min fridom.<br/><br/>Reglane og lovene BØR eksistere innanfor rammene av samfunnet strengt for å halde i sjakk den gode gamle «Eg kan gjere kva eg vil og det er berre eg som er fri»-linja med hestemøkk.<br/><br/>Korporasjonar har ingen rettar, dorkus! globalt har dei vore grunnen til at det er så mange mislukka statar, plyndra av viljen til korporatokratar basert i USA som trur at ytringsfridomen deira omset til; "Gjør som vi seier, ellers bombar vi deg for å få ressursane vi treng" slags voldtekt og plyndring.<br/><br/>Eg håpar ein dag at nokre rasshøl vil kødda med deg med ytringsfridomen sin, og så vil vi høyre deg sutre over korleis lova sviktar deg. Kva lov? I den libertarianske verda di 'Eg kan gjera kva eg vil', er den einaste rettsregelen du lagar for å rettferdiggjere sluttmålet ditt. For deg vil det då vere morosamt å sjå korleis du takler nokre andre rasshøl si tolking av at grensa di berre er litt av ei uleie for måla hans, som ikkje nødvendigvis respekterte grensene dine i det heile tatt, forbanna sikkert!<br/><br/>Nokon som heiter "uh huh, right.." kan ha eit logisk poeng gøymt i skogen av namngjeving og stråmann-misbruk, men kva med dette: Korporasjonar er oppfinningar av staten som er laga for å overføre ein del av risikoen ved å drive forretning frå dei som driv forretninga over til aksjonærane (om nokon), kundane (om nokon) og publikum. Så om eit selskap gjer ein svindel, er det selskapet som blir straffa (vanlegvis) og bøtelagt og dei som driv selskapet får gå sin veg med eit gyllent handtrykk. Og kostnaden for bota vert sendt vidare til kundane og betalt til styresmaktene (ikkje offera!). For Davids skuld, viss me skilde regjering og handel, ville selskap slutte å eksistere! Ikkje ein dårleg ide.<br/><br/>Eg trur poenget er at dersom eit selskap gjer ein økonomisk kriminalitet, og ingen legg merke til det (som om treet fell i skogen og ingen høyrer det, gjorde det verkeleg eit støytt argument) så skjedde det faktisk ein kriminalitet?<br/><br/>og i eit veitch-diagram, der dei to blokkene kolliderer og samhandlar, om den eine krenkjer den andre sin grense, kven er dommaren over kven som vart krenka?<br/><br/>Poenget mitt er dette: det er ingen stråmann-argument når det gjeld Davids asinine vurdering om at selskap kan gjere kva dei vil med å forlate. sanninga i saka er å gje selskap og oligarkar, eller kven som helst, løyve til å gjere kva dei vil, når dei vil, under premissa at dei ER INDIVIDUELLE og dermed, garantert FRI SPRÅK, er både absurd og hestemøkk.<br/><br/>Kvar og ein skal dømma om si eiga gjerning og få ros for det han sjølv gjer, ikkje for det andre har gjort.<br/><br/>Om det er den verda David vil leve i, la han dra dit og få det til å skje, men for Guds skyld, ikkje forvent at eg ikkje skal protestere mot den dritten!<br/><br/>Vi kan alle komme overens, så lenge grensene ikkje blir overtrådt etter vilje av nokon som meiner at retten til å gjere det dei vil faktisk opphever retten min til ikkje å bli forstyrret av handlingane deira.<br/><br/>Når det gjeld selskap, har dei ingen rett til å krenke mine rettar, eller dine, eller nokon andre sine. Dersom dei ikkje kan fungere i samfunnet som ein velvillig og dermed ikkje-hindrande eining, så har dei ingen rett til å eksistere.<br/><br/>og David vart ikkje truga. Han er eit rasshøl for å hevde at "Gjør kva du vil, det er ytringsfridom" er eit vås av hestemøkk. Det er la la land bullshit. Og eg protesterer mot nokon eller noko som krenkjer mine grenser med den ytringsfridomspåstanden. Det er noko dritt, og du veit at det er det!<br/><br/>Vel, det var eit fargerikt svar. Trist, "uh-uh," du er langt frå merket. Eg sa aldri at folk har rett til å krenke andre sine rettar... og eg avviser "slutt rettferdiggjer middelet" tenking. Ja, lovene må finnast, men berre for å verna om rettane til menneska. Eg er lei meg at du har eit så forvrengt og grueleg feilaktig syn på argumentet mitt.<br/><br/>« Eg held det for ei lukke at det er framfor deg, David, eg har spytta på kornet ditt. » Eg trur at du meinte at selskapa var i stand til å gjere kva dei ville under denne retten til ytringsfridom, som i Amerk'a er ein spøk i dag fordi PATRIOT ACT og ein ikkje-erklært tilstand av MARTIAL LOVEN me har levd under sidan september 2001, har gjeve styresmaktene høve til å suspendere og eller «skrapa» den amerikanske grunnlova og lovforslaget.<br/><br/>Dessverre har folk berre nokre få rettar. vi har rett til å bli beskatta til det absurde. vi har rett til å bli vernepliktige og bli kanonføde for oligarkkrigar. og me har retten til å tie stille medan me blir plaga av selskap og oligarkar og bankfolk. Det er rettane våre, og trist nok, dei er verkeleg SUCKETH, David. Eg trur me kan vere samde om det!<br/><br/>Eg lurer framleis på korleis nybegynnaren, Roberts, arva Chief Justiceship etter Rhenquist i staden for at rolla gjekk til nokon med meir erfaring på benken. Gjev dei rett til å stemme i vallokala som ekte folk?; kanskje har menneskestemmer talt som 3/5 av ein person eller mindre til deira 1?<br/><br/>Eg har ikkje lese heile den 183 sider lange boka «herskande» enno, men finn desse forferdelege utsegna deri som ikkje berre er i motsetnad til dei utstrakte handlingane deira i dette tilfellet, men òg noko av ei abdikasjon av plikta deira:<br/><br/>Blodgett mot Holden, 275 U.S. 142, 147–148 (1927) (Holmes, J., konkurrerte). Fordi innsatsen er så høg, er vår standard praksis å avstå frå å ta opp konstitusjonelle spørsmål, bortsett frå når det er nødvendig for å avgjere om spesielle krav før oss. Sjå Ashwander v. TVA, 297 U.S. 288, 346–348 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concur-ring). Denne politikken ligg både til grunn for vår vilje til å tolka tvetydige statuttar for å unngå konstitusjonelle problem og vår praksis «aldri å formulere ein regel i konstitusjonell lov breiare enn det som er kravd av dei nøyaktige faktaa som han skal gjelde for.» USA v.

Han sa spesifikt at han ikkje ville gå denne vegen med å skrive avgjerder som ikkje var basert på avgjorte, ikkje-kontroversielle omgrep i den amerikanske grunnlova... og her har han tydeleg gjort akkurat det motsette av det.<br/><br/>Den verkelege skulda skulle vere skulda på skuldrane til kuksugarane i SENATE som stadfesta den jævelen i første omgang, og sa at dei ikkje ville stemme imot stadfestinga hans fordi dei lagra ammunisjonen sin for REAL TRUSTS TO US..<br/><br/>Jeg klandrer de jævla DINOKRATER mer enn jeg klandrer den løgnaktige haugen av dritt som heter Roberts, drittsekker som SCHUMER og den andre drittsekken fra Illinois, og den løgnaktige sionistiske jævelen Levin fra Michigan. Berre eit par av dei som heldt i bakken kunne ha stoppa konfirmasjonen til Alito, og så Roberts.<br/><br/>Påstanden om at alt dette faktisk er vindaugsdressing er riktig, og sanninga er, sjølv om det er eit klårt brot på rettane våre over heile linja, at desse avskummen i SCOTUS berre er postfakta, og hevdar at dei dreiv med oss i lang, lang, lang tid.<br/><br/>sanninga er at det aldri hadde noko å seie kva me trudde skjedde, fordi selskapa har fungert godt utanfor lova i lang tid no, og ingen har halde dei til ansvar. Sjølve kjeltringane som sit på SCOTUS er velgjerarar av urettferda og grådigheten til selskapa som gjev dei tilbakeslag for avgjerdene sine, i form av STOCK DIVIDDENDS.<br/><br/>Å fokusere på den korrupte SCOTUS hjelper oss dessverre ikkje mye. Det er som å si det åpenbare, og forvente at det skal være straffbart, når det ikkje er det.<br/><br/>Når dei tek bort kvar einaste rest av personleg verdigheit frå heile middelklassen i dette landet, vil det vere eit helvete å betala for det.

Seksjon 441b ville derfor vere overdriven sjølv om vi antok, og argumenterte, at regjeringa har ein tvingende interesse i å avgrense utanlandsk påverknad over vår politiske prosess.<br/>U.S., på 615. >><br/><br/>USA gjekk konkurs då FDR kalla inn gullet. Vi hadde ikkje meir gull å betala for papiret vi lånte frå Fed. Det er no i ein årleg konkurs overgang. Regjeringa er no privat som BLACKWATER. Alle statlege verksemder er oppførte på DUNN AND BRADSTREET. Den vanlege lova som grunnlova spesifiserer gjeld for naturlege personar. All verksemda til domstolane i dag er bedrifta meiner vi blir sett på som enkeltpersonlege selskap. Vi eksisterer etter kontrakt med staten. Hugs det 14. grunnlovstillegget. Det var ingen amerikanske borgarar før det. Dei fleste av oss har uvitande gjort krav på amerikansk bedriftsborgarskap. Vi må adressere regelen av bankeliten. Nesten alle dei leiande REPS og DEMS er medlemer av Council of Foreign Relations eller TLC. Sjå på historia om kven som starta og kontrollerer desse. Rush, Glenn og Sean er alle løgnarar og bankfolk som sleiker. Obama er ein marionett for CFR. Sanning har mykje meir å seia, og ville tent til å forene det ærlege folket i dette landet.<br/><br/>Eg trur verkeleg ikkje at eg er eit selskap eller borgar av ein, men om gubbermint meiner det, meiner SCOTUS-dommen at det ikkje er fleire grenser for kampanjebidrag på nokon, bedrifter eller enkeltpersonar? Eg vil heller sjå pengar fjerna frå valprosessen vår heilt - lik tid på Amerikas luftbølgjer gjeven utan kostnad for alle kandidatar |
| And so the TWEWY Spriting Thread army set off, their destination being Japan. Unfortunately, no airline whatsoever would let them on board because of their rather large amassment of weapons of moderate destruction. And pitchtorches, which constituted both a fire and a stabbing hazard. And so, they just went home and downloaded the movie Kanon wanted to watch illegally. They gave it 7/10 stars on rotten tomatoes. The End.<br/><br/>Spoiler:The bottom right Sprite is the new one.<br/><br/>Highlight this box with your cursor to read the spoiler text. Yes, he's using a sword. I like to be boring and generic like that. Besides, no one else took the easy, predictable route, so somebody had to. Peace out.<br/><br/>Spoiler:The bottom right Sprite is the new one.<br/><br/>Yes, he's using a sword. I like to be boring and generic like that. Besides, no one else took the easy, predictable route, so somebody had to. Peace out.<br/><br/>The first sprite was half made by me. The second row contains a teaser for the continuation of the clown sprites i made a while back. And the third row is just a few old sprites that i decided to fix up and redo some parts.<br/><br/>So I just joined, and tried to make a sprite, it turned out ok, but it seemed like a lot of work, and I only made a few changes to neku. How do you make the complicated ones?<br/><br/>Spoiler:<br/><br/>Highlight this box with your cursor to read the spoiler text.<br/><br/>Spoiler:<br/><br/>How to get better at spriting:<br/><br/>1. To start off, master the art of recoloring sprites and shading. 2. Next start copying and pasting body parts to other sprites. E.x Take the arm band off of neku and put it on joshua. 3. Start small by switching around body parts and re-coloring them. (in other words, just experiment and see which combo you like) 4. Then start to challenging yourself to make more complex sprites. Instead of copying and pasting and recoloring, you can try and draw clothes or faces. 5. PRACTICE PRACTICE AND MORE PRACTICE. Keep practicing and experimenting and never give upPeace out.<br/><br/>Sometimes people need to be reminded not to give up so easily and continue to persist. | Så TWEWY Spriting Thread-hæren sette avgårde, og målet deira var Japan, og dessverre ville ikkje noko flyselskap i det heile tatt sleppe dei om bord på grunn av den ganske store mengda av våpen med moderat øydelegging. Og lommelykter, som utgjorde både ein brann og ein knivstikkingsfare. Så dei gjekk berre heim og lasta ned filmen Kanon ønskte å sjå ulovleg. Dei gav det 7/10 stjerner på råtne tomater. Enden.<br/><br/>Spoiler: Nederst til høgre Sprite er den nye.<br/><br/>Marker denne boksen med musepeikaren for å lese spoilerteksten. Ja, han brukar eit sverd. Eg likar å vere leiande og generisk som det. Dessutan tok ingen andre den enkle, forutsigbare ruten, så nokon måtte.

Dessutan tok ingen andre den enkle, forutsigbare ruten, så nokon måtte. Fred vere med deg.<br/><br/>Den første spriten var halvt laga av meg. Den andre rada inneheld ein teaser for vidareføringa av klovne sprites eg laga for ei stund sidan. Og den tredje rada er berre nokre gamle sprites som eg bestemte meg for å fiksa opp og gjere om på nokre delar.<br/><br/>Så eg vart berre med, og prøvde å lage ein sprite, det viste seg ok, men det verka som mykje arbeid, og eg gjorde berre nokre få endringar til neku. Korleis lagar du dei kompliserte?<br/><br/>Spoiler:<br/><br/>Marker denne boksen med musepeikaren for å lesa spoilerteksten.<br/><br/>Spoiler:<br/><br/>Korleis bli betre til å spy:<br/><br/>1. Start med å mestre kunsten å fargeleggje sprites og skyggeleggje. 2. Deretter byrjar du å kopiere og lima inn kroppsdelar til andre sprites. E.x Ta armbandet av neku og legg det på joshua. 3. Start smått ved å bytte om kroppsdelar og fargelegg dei på nytt. 4. Utfordre deg sjølv til å laga meir kompliserte sprites. I staden for å kopiera, lima inn og fargeleggje, kan du prøva å teikna klede eller ansikt. 5. ØV DEG OG MER ØV DEG. Hald fram med å utprøva det de kan seia, og ta aldri bort det som blir sett fram for dykk!<br/><br/>Av og til må folk påminnast om ikkje å gje opp så lett og halde fram. |
| Interpretive Summary: This book chapter reviews various aspects of what is needed for the selection of model weeds to answer questions pertinent to weed science. Specifically, the chapter covers why we need model species, attributes of model species, and provides the current state of knowledge and resources that have been developed for a few key weeds such as leafy spurge, Canada thistle, waterhemp, and purple false brome that may make them good potential models.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract:<br/>Selection of a limited number of model weeds and development of genomic-based tools and resources will facilitate studies on the ecology, biology, physiology and development of weedy species. Such studies will help answer fundamental questions of concern to weed scientists. However, to ensure the weed science community can appropriately and fully utilize these model weeds, they will need to be carefully selected. Various attributes such as ease of study, weedy characteristics, and importance as a weedy species will need to be considered. Additionally, the availability of existing genomic resources can be used to extend the list of viable model weeds. Several resources have also been developed specifically for weeds such as leafy spurge, Canada thistle, waterhemp, and purple false brome. | Tolkingsoppsummering: Dette bokkapittelet går gjennom ulike aspekt av kva som trengst for å velje modellugress for å svare på spørsmål som er relevante for ugrasvitskap. Kapittelet dekkjer spesifikt kvifor me treng modellartar, attributtar til modellartar, og gjev den noverande kunnskaps- og ressurstilstanden som er utvikla for nokre få viktige ugras som bladspurv, kanadisk tistel, vasshamp og lilla falsk brom som kan gjere dei til gode potensielle modellar.<br/><br/>Teknisk sammendrag:<br/>Utval av eit avgrensa tal modellugress og utvikling av genombasert verktøy og ressursar vil legge til rette for studiar av økologi, biologi, fysiologi og utvikling av ugrasartar. Slike studiar vil bidra til å svare på fundamentale spørsmål av bekymring for ugrasforskarar, men for å sikre at ugrasforskarsamfunnet kan utnytte disse modellugresset på riktig måte og fullt ut, må dei veljes med omhu. Ulike eigenskapar som enkel studie, ugrasaktige eigenskapar og viktigheit som ugrasaktig art må vurderast. I tillegg kan tilgjengelegheita av eksisterande genomiske ressursar brukast til å utvida lista over levedyktige modellugras. Fleire ressursar er òg utvikla spesielt for ugras som bladspurv, kanadisk tistel, vasshamp og lilla falsk brom. |
