| Forty-nine years ago today, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act of 1965.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Nearly a century ago, the 15th Amendment to the Constitution stated, "The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of race, color or previous condition of servitude." And nearly a century before that, our nation's founding fathers set in motion the great experiment of American democracy by declaring that "all men are created equal."<br/><br/>The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was a belated acknowledgment that even in America, our foundational ideals carry little weight if not protected by the rule of law. That's why Section 2 of the 15th Amendment granted Congress the "power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation."<br/><br/>And indeed, the codified language of the Voting Rights Act was able to achieve what the Reconstruction-era Congress and Thomas Jefferson could not. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act—and the civil rights movement from which they emerged—served as the catalyst for a dramatic increase in the opportunity for black Americans to participate in the democratic process.<br/><br/>For example, only 6.7 percent of eligible black Mississippians were registered to vote as of 1962; by 1969 that figure had reached 66.5 percent. Today, Mississippi has more black elected officials than any other state.<br/><br/>The protections put in place by the Voting Rights Act were long overdue when they were passed, representative of the arduous struggle with which they were achieved. But unthinkably, these protections are now under assault, jeopardizing the progress our nation worked so hard to achieve.<br/><br/>Last year, in the case of Shelby County v. Holder, the U.S. Supreme Court gutted a key component of the Voting Rights Act that enabled prior federal review to ensure nondiscrimination before any new voting law went into effect.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Sadly, the response of Republican leaders has been to do nothing. Sen. Ted Cruz and Gov. Rick Perry went out of their way to praise the Supreme Court's decision. Sen. Rand Paul dismissed the continued necessity of the Voting Rights Act by noting, "We have an African-American president."<br/><br/>While the election of President Barack Obama was indeed a historic milestone, it is dangerous to think that it absolves us from remaining vigilant against the lingering consequences of our nation's past. The haste with which states have moved to enact voting restrictions is confirmation that the protections put in place by Section 4 are still necessary.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Republican governors have signed strict photo-identification restrictions into law as the solution to a virtually nonexistent problem of voter impersonation, disproportionately hurting women, young people, working families and the African-American community. It's disingenuous for Republicans like Paul to seek the votes of these communities when they believe "there's nothing wrong with" putting restrictions in place that make it harder for these constituencies to vote.<br/><br/>Republicans have also sought to restrict early-voting periods, including the Sunday before Election Day, when African-American churches have had great success with Souls to the Polls programs.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>These restrictions represent a callous effort by Republicans to make voting harder, based on narrow, short-term political calculations that Republicans can win elections by shrinking the size of the electorate.<br/><br/>Democrats have a very different mission when it comes to voting: to ensure that every eligible voter can register, that every registered voter can vote and that every vote is accurately counted.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>The Democratic National Committee's Voter Expansion Project reflects our belief that greater voter participation strengthens our nation and our democracy. We'll continue to use our unmatched institutional knowledge to protect voting rights against legislation and tactics that would attempt to suppress the vote. And because the best defense is a good offense, we're also working to expand the vote by deploying our technology and data resources to register new voters.<br/><br/>On this anniversary, one of the best ways we can honor those who struggled—and in some cases gave their very lives—for the legislation's passage is for Republicans in Congress to join Democrats in passing the Voting Rights Amendment Act to restore the promise of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Democrat, represents Florida's 23rd Congressional District in the United States Congress. Since 2011, she has served as chair of the Democratic National Committee. Follow her on Twitter.<br/><br/>The Root aims to foster and advance conversations about issues relevant to the black Diaspora by presenting a variety of opinions from all perspectives, whether or not those opinions are shared by our editorial staff. | For 49 år sidan i dag underteikna president Lyndon B. Johnson stemmerettslova av 1965.<br/><br/>Reklame<br/><br/>For nesten hundre år sidan sa det 15. grunnlovstillegget: «Retten til amerikanske borgarar til å stemme skal ikkje nektast eller forkortast av USA eller av nokon stat på grunn av rase, farge eller tidlegare trelldomstilstand.» Og nesten eit hundreår før det, sette nasjonens grunnleggjarar i gang det store eksperimentet med amerikansk demokrati ved å erklære at "alle menneske er skapt likeverdige."<br/><br/>Stemmerettslova av 1965 var ei forseinka erkjenning av at sjølv i Amerika har våre grunnleggjande ideal liten vekt om ikkje verna av rettsstatsprinsippet. Det er difor paragraf 2 i det 15. endringstillegget gav Kongressen «makt til å handheve denne artikkelen ved høveleg lovgjeving.»<br/><br/>Og faktisk klarte det kodifiserte språket i Stemmerettslova å oppnå det Rekonstruksjons-æra-kongressen og Thomas Jefferson ikkje kunne. Borgarrettslova av 1964 og Stemmerettslova – og borgarrettsrørsla dei kom frå – fungerte som katalysator for ei dramatisk auke i moglegheita for svarte amerikanarar til å delta i den demokratiske prosessen.<br/><br/>Til dømes var berre 6,7 prosent av dei svarte i Mississippi registrerte til å stemme i 1962. I 1969 hadde dette talet nådd 66,5 prosent. I dag har Mississippi fleire svarte valde embetsmenn enn nokon annan stat.<br/><br/>Verneområda som vart innførte med røysterettslova var forlengst forsvunne då dei vart vedtekne, noko som var representativt for den harde kampen dei vart oppnådde med. Men utænkeleg nok er desse verna no under angrep, noko som set framstega nasjonen vår har arbeidd så hardt for å oppnå i fare.<br/><br/>I fjor, i saka Shelby County mot Holder, avviste den amerikanske høgsteretten ein nøkkelkomponent i stemmerettslova som gjorde det mogleg med ei tidlegare føderal gjennomgang for å sikre ikkje-diskriminering før ei ny stemmerettslov tredde i kraft.<br/><br/>Reklame<br/><br/>Den republikanske leiaren Ted Cruz og guvernør Rick Perry gjekk ut av lag for å lovprise avgjerda til Høgsterett. Senator Rand Paul avviste den vedvarande naudsynte stemmerettslova ved å notere: «Vi har ein afroamerikansk president.»<br/><br/>Sjølv om valet av president Barack Obama faktisk var ein historisk milepæl, er det farleg å tru at det frikjenner oss frå å vere på vakt mot dei langvarige konsekvensane av fortida til nasjonen vår.

Det er ukonvensjonelt for republikanarar som Paul å søkje stemmene til desse samfunna når dei trur «det er ikkje noko i veien med» å innføre restriksjonar som gjer det vanskelegare for desse valkretsane å stemme.<br/><br/>Republikanarane har òg søkt å avgrensa tidlege valperiodar, inkludert søndagen før valdagen, då afroamerikanske kyrkjer har hatt stor suksess med Souls to the Polls-programma.<br/><br/>Reklame<br/><br/>Desse restriksjonane representerer ein kaldblodig innsats frå republikanarane for å gjere det vanskelegare å stemme, basert på smale, kortsiktige politiske utrekningar om at republikanarane kan vinne val ved å krympe storleiken på veljarane.<br/><br/>Demokratar har eit heilt anna oppdrag når det gjeld å stemme: å sørgje for at alle valbare kan registrere seg, at alle registrerte veljarar kan stemme og at kvar stemme blir nøyaktig tald.<br/><br/>Reklame<br/><br/>Den demokratiske nasjonale komiteen sitt utvidingsprosjekt for veljarar reflekterer vår tru på at større valdeltaking styrkjer nasjonen og demokratiet vårt. Vi vil halde fram med å bruke vår uovertrufne institusjonelle kunnskap til å verna røysteretten mot lovar og taktikkar som ville forsøkt å undertrykke avstemminga. Og fordi det beste forsvaret er eit godt overgrep, arbeider vi òg med å utvide avstemminga ved å bruke teknologien og dataressursane våre til å registrere nye veljarar.<br/><br/>På dette jubileet er ein av dei beste måtane vi kan heidra dei som strevde – og i nokre tilfelle gav sjølve livet sitt – for lovgjevinga er at republikanarane i Kongressen skal gå saman med demokratane i å vedta endringslova om røysterett for å gjenopprette lovnaden om røysterett frå 1965.<br/><br/>Reklame<br/><br/>Debbie Wasserman Schultz, ein demokrat, representerer Florida sitt 23. kongressdistrikt i den amerikanske kongressen.

| Q&A: Vatican safeguarding expert Fr Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>13 June 2021<br/><br/>Fr Hans Zollner SJ. Image: Australian Jesuits.<br/><br/>The President of the Centre for Child Protection at the Gregorian University in Rome, and a member of the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors, Fr Hans Zollner SJ, was in Australia in 2018 to speak to Catholic ministry leaders and survivors.<br/><br/>Michael McVeigh from Jesuit Communications sat down with him during the visit to explore how the Church is responding to the abuse crisis internationally, and what can be learned from our experiences in Australia.<br/><br/>MM: This is your third trip to Australia. You've visited quite a few other countries to see how the Church is responding to abuse around the world. Can you give us some idea of what the global picture looks like?<br/><br/>Fr Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>HZ: My understanding, after having visited about 50 countries on five or six continents, is that the Church is really starting to move over the last couple of years on the issue of doing justice to victims, of listening to them, and doing whatever can be done in terms of safeguarding.<br/><br/>I was with the Jesuit Provincials from all over Africa at the end of April, and the President of the Jesuit Assistancy of Africa and Madagascar is very much committed and dedicated to this. He has put up a thorough action plan for formation and for introducing guidelines all over the place. It's a very considerate and very deliberate effort to do whatever can be done to be proactively engaged as Jesuits in Africa — in a continent where until a few years ago all of this was a foreign language.<br/><br/>One of the challenges of trying to develop this global approach is that you're dealing with so many cultures, and so many different understandings. How do you bring this together and try to provide training and support religious communities tackling these issues?<br/><br/>This is one of the major questions we have. I think what I can do is stimulate discussion, stimulate reflection, and prepare people as much as possible so that they can do the groundwork.<br/><br/>The Centre for Child Protection at the Gregorian University does not pretend to have the response to every question. Not only because we don't know the specific contexts — we might know a few of them, but we're talking about thousands of cultures, we're talking about hundreds of languages, we're talking about very diverse legal backgrounds. It varies even sometimes within one country, such as Australia where you have states within the Commonwealth of Australia that have different laws than other states.<br/><br/>I am somebody who tries to elicit and stimulate discussion and reflection. I'm also very happy to listen to people.<br/><br/>You mentioned the need to listen and support victims in being heard. We've obviously had the Royal Commission here in Australia, but what are some of the other ways that you've seen that the voices of victims are being supported around the world?<br/><br/>In France there is one diocese that has established what they call 'The Listening Space'. There, victims can come forward and they can express themselves. The bishop is present. It's an open space in which people who have been hurt tremendously are free at least to express what they want to ask from the Church leadership etc.<br/><br/>There are other places in the USA or in other countries where victims have been invited by dioceses, by Provinces, by the leadership of the Church, to come forward. I have to say that overall I think there is a good will, and there are more people like bishops and provincials who listen to victims than we know. But there is no one model of giving victims not only the space to express themselves and be listened to, but also to engage actively in Church development.<br/><br/>In terms of setting up spaces for support for victims, what are some of the things you've seen that could really help — and that we could be considering here in Australia?<br/><br/>One of the major points that many victims bring up is, 'Can't we have, within parish settings, within schools settings, a regular conversation going on that includes survivors of abuse as regular members of a committee, a commission, a sounding board, a feedback group or something like that?' So that this voice is not only brought in on a specific occasion, or where a person feels like he or she is at a point to be able to speak out about it, but [is heard] on a regular basis — build that voice into the system.<br/><br/>That will help all of us. It will help survivors and victims because they will feel welcome and appreciated in the specific experience, and in the specific life challenges, that they went through. Secondly it will help the community at large, because we can at least make ourselves more and more sensitive to what the concerns and specific needs of survivors are — that can also talk to the needs of young people.<br/><br/>M: We have strong groups of survivors here in Australia who have been able to support each other through that process. But what you're saying is that we need some way of supporting those groups, and supporting those people, through our own institutions as well?<br/><br/>And I think we need to be creative. It will work for one school and one parish and one diocese in one way, and for others in a different way. Because the survivors with whom I am in constant contact, they have quite similar requests, and similar experiences in regard to being welcomed in the Church or not — feeling thrown out or dismissed. But they have also among themselves quite different expectations. So I have learned that you have also to be very forthcoming in accepting the differences in what this specific group, or this specific survivor, wants, requests and needs.<br/><br/>M: Survivors talk about wanting to have their stories heard and acknowledged. We've had the Royal Commission here in Australia, which provided an independent process where victims could come forward. Is there a need for something like that in terms of a truth, justice and reconciliation process for the Church internationally?<br/><br/>H: Yes, I think there is a need for that internationally. But I think first every local church needs to do its own homework. I don't see it happening very soon that some such council or commission would be established to look into this area for the whole Church. The Church has a membership of 1.3 billion people, and is present in 190 countries, with all kinds of differences in expectations concerning psychological, spiritual and financial support.<br/><br/>There is one thing that I have come across consistently in communicating with, working with and listening to victims, and that is that they want to be listened to. So if there was the feeling that victims were constantly being listened to — in Rome and elsewhere — I think that would give a great relief to many victims.<br/><br/>I think [Pope Francis'] concern, especially with regard to your question, is that the local churches do whatever they can so that victims will be listened to in that particular country. I have a list of people who want to speak to the Holy Father directly, and physically it is impossible. I was there in 2014 to translate for two German survivors who were chosen with two Irish and two English survivors when he received the six of them at home. He took the whole morning listening to them one after the other. For each one, he was there for 40 to 45 minutes. Were he to do this for every survivor he couldn't sleep anymore.<br/><br/>His example is modelling for the whole Catholic Church the way victims and survivors are received, welcomed and listened to. I think if the bishops and the provincials in this world, in all countries, followed his example, many survivors would be really appreciative of that.<br/><br/>Archbishop Diarmud Martin was recently quoted just before the World Meeting of Families, about the Pontifical Commission, saying that it's too small as it's currently set up to achieve what it needs to achieve. What's your take on that? Does the Church need to be putting more resources into how it's overseeing those issues?<br/><br/>At the moment we are 16 members from basically all continents, and the major language groups. We represent a variety of disciplines and professions, and the purpose of the commission — as the statutes that have just been promulgated state — is to provide counsel to the Holy Father.<br/><br/>A common misunderstanding about the commission is first that we deal with cases of allegations. That is not the case. We have no juridical or administrative power in regards to cases, because when it comes to allegations of abuse the tribunals and procedure are set.<br/><br/>A second misunderstanding is that we promote, directly, things on the ground. Our first and foremost goal is that we advise the Holy Father on issues.<br/><br/>So from my point of view, yes, we need to invest more. But we need to invest more on the local level, and we need to make sure that the proposals from the Pontifical Commission are forwarded to the Holy Father — which normally the President does — and then there is a follow-up process that reflects what we have given as our advice.<br/><br/>In Australia, Catholic Professional Standards Limited is overseeing the Church's response and providing guidelines and support for ensuring all the institutions in the Church are child-safe institutions. Is there a need for some kind of organisational support from Rome for those bishops and dioceses that are struggling to form these institutions and provide safeguarding in those dioceses?<br/><br/>I think ultimately the commission will develop in that line. They are now in the process of hiring experts in those areas.<br/><br/>I think the Church needs to understand that the local churches can learn from each other mutually. And my understanding has always been — and I think the Holy Father has reminded us — that the Church will not function as a centralised company. It does not work like that, effectively. Every bishop, every bishops conference, has, to some extent, its life on its own. What we need to learn more is to open channels of mutual communication.<br/><br/>There are a number of things that people blame for abuse in the Church. As a priest and a psychologist, and as someone who has met and worked with survivors, what are your thoughts on that issue?<br/><br/>I think the question of where does abuse come from is the most important one, and the Pope has addressed that in his letter to the people of God published on 20 August. He says in the first paragraph, and repeats it over and over again, that the question of sexual abuse is always linked — or almost always linked — not only to the question of abuse of power, but also to the abuse of conscience.<br/><br/>So the real fundamental question of abuse is much more complex than just [the question of] sexuality — be it heterosexual or homosexual. It's a power issue, and there we have to really work on the question of how do we understand priesthood, how to we understand bishophood, how do we understand and live out our ministries? What are the boundaries?<br/><br/>That's why I'm very happy that the Jesuit Province in Australia is establishing a Code of Conduct. Because we don't talk only about sexual abuse of minors. We talk about sexual abuse of adults, and we talk about abuse in other ways — like abuse of conscience, where you dictate to someone what you think, or you pretend to know by God, and you can tell another person, 'You need to do that', against the conscience of that person.<br/><br/>Many people think celibacy produces abuse. As I always say, celibacy as such is not cause for abusing — otherwise how do we explain that 99.9 per cent of all abusers do not live a celibate life, and how do we explain that 95 or 96 per cent of all priests do not abuse minors? But, celibacy, or a vow of chastity, that is not really integrated, that is not really lived out properly — yes, that produces a problem. Sometimes people take to drinking, sometime they take to gambling, and sometimes they take to sexual misconduct, with adults and with minors.<br/><br/>The real question about this is how do we deal with the notion of religious spiritual power with which priests and bishops are invested? How can theology help us to understand, and maybe how can sociology, psychology, or business administration help us to define the limits of power, and the necessity of keeping your boundaries | Q&A: Vatikanet sikrar sakkyndig Fr Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>13. juni 2021<br/><br/>Fr Hans Zollner SJ. Bilete: Australske jesuittar.<br/><br/>Presidenten for Senter for barnevern ved Det gregorianske universitetet i Roma, og eit medlem av Den pavelege kommisjonen for vern av mindreårige, Fr. Hans Zollner SJ, var i Australia i 2018 for å snakke med katolske departementsleiarar og overlevande.<br/><br/>Michael McVeigh frå Jesuit Communications sette seg ned med han under vitjinga for å undersøkje korleis kyrkja reagerer på misbrukskrisa internasjonalt, og kva vi kan lære av erfaringane våre i Australia.<br/><br/>MM: Dette er din tredje tur til Australia. Du har vore i mange andre land for å sjå korleis Kyrkja reagerer på misbruk rundt om i verda. Kan du gje oss ein idé om korleis det globale biletet ser ut?<br/><br/>Fr Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>HZ: Min forståing, etter å ha vitja om lag 50 land på fem eller seks kontinent, er at Kyrkja verkeleg har byrja å røra seg dei siste par åra når det gjeld å yte offera rettferd, å lytta til dei, og å gjere det ein kan for å sikra.<br/><br/>Eg var med jesuittprovinsane frå heile Afrika i slutten av april, og presidenten i Jesuit Assistance of Africa and Madagascar er svært engasjert og dedisert til dette. Han har lagt fram ein grundig handlingsplan for danninga og for innføring av retningsliner over heile staden. Det er eit svært omtenksamt og svært bevisst forsøk på å gjere alt som kan gjerast for å bli proaktivt engasjert som jesuittar i Afrika — på eit kontinent der inntil for nokre år sidan alt dette var eit framandspråk.<br/><br/>Ein av utfordringane med å prøve å utvikle denne globale tilnærminga er at ein har å gjere med så mange kulturar, og så mange ulike forståingar. Korleis samlar du dette og prøver å gje opplæring og støtte religiøse samfunn som tek opp desse spørsmåla?<br/><br/>Dette er eit av dei store spørsmåla me har. Eg trur det eg kan gjere er å stimulere til diskusjon, stimulere til refleksjon, og førebu folk så mykje som mogleg slik at dei kan gjere grunnarbeidet.<br/><br/>Senter for barnevern ved Det gregorianske universitetet later ikkje som om dei har svar på alle spørsmål. Ikkje berre fordi me ikkje kjenner til dei spesifikke samanhengane -- me kjenner kanskje til nokre få av dei, men me snakkar om tusenvis av kulturar, me snakkar om hundrevis av språk, me snakkar om svært ulike juridiske bakgrunnar. Det varierer til og med nokre gonger innanfor eitt land, som Australia der ein har statar innanfor Samveldet Australia som har andre lover enn andre statar.<br/><br/>Eg er ein person som prøver å fremje og stimulere diskusjon og refleksjon. Eg er òg veldig glad for å lytte til folk.<br/><br/>Vi har hatt Royal Commission her i Australia, men kva er nokre av dei andre måtene du har sett at stemmene til offer blir støtta over heile verda?<br/><br/>I Frankrike er det eitt bispedøme som har etablert det dei kallar 'The Listening Space'. Der kan offera stå fram og dei kan uttrykke seg. Biskopen er til stades. Det er ein open plass der folk som har vore hardt skadde er frie til i det minste å uttrykke det dei ynskjer å be om frå Kyrkjas leiarskap osb.<br/><br/>Det finst andre stader i USA eller i andre land der offer har blitt invitert av bispedøme, av provinsar, av leiinga i kyrkja, til å stå fram. Eg må seie at generelt trur eg det er ein god vilje, og det er fleire som biskopar og fylkesmenn som høyrer på offer enn vi veit. Men det finst ingen modell for å gje offera ikkje berre rom til å uttrykkje seg og bli høyrt, men også til å ta aktivt del i Kyrkjeutviklinga.<br/><br/>Når det gjeld å setje opp rom for støtte til offer, kva er nokre av dei tinga du har sett som verkeleg kan hjelpe - og som vi kan vurdere her i Australia?<br/><br/>Eit av dei store punkta som mange offer tar opp er: «Kan me ikkje, innan soknerådsinnstillingar, innan skuleinnstillingar, ha ein fast samtale som omfattar overlevande frå overgrep som faste medlemmer av ein komité, ein kommisjon, eit sokneråd, ei tilbakemeldingsgruppe eller noko slikt?» Slik at denne røysta ikkje berre blir henta inn ved ei bestemt høve, eller der ein person føler at han eller ho er på eit tidspunkt for å kunne uttale seg om det, men [er høyrt] med jamne mellomrom — bygg den røysta inn i systemet.<br/><br/>Det vil hjelpe oss alle, det vil hjelpe overlevande og offer fordi dei vil føle seg velkomne og sette pris på den konkrete opplevinga og dei konkrete livsutfordringane dei har gått gjennom. For det andre vil det hjelpe samfunnet som helhet, fordi vi i det minste kan gjere oss meir og meir bevisste på kva bekymringane og dei spesifikke behova til overlevande er – som også kan snakke med dei unge.<br/><br/>M: Vi har sterke grupper av overlevande her i Australia som har vore i stand til å støtte kvarandre gjennom den prosessen. Men det du seier er at me treng ein måte å støtta desse gruppene, og støtta desse menneska, gjennom våre eigne institusjonar òg?<br/><br/>Og eg trur vi må vere kreative. Det vil fungere for ein skule og eit sogn og eit bispedømme på ein måte, og for andre på ein annan måte. Fordi dei overlevande som eg er i konstant kontakt med, har ganske liknande førespurnader, og liknande opplevingar når det gjeld å bli velkomen i kyrkja eller ikkje - å føle seg kasta ut eller avvist. Men no veit eg at de må skryta av dykk sjølve. Det finst ikkje noko anna; det er berre nokre som fortener at de gjer det, og at de heller ikkje blir mottekne av det.<br/><br/>M: Overlevande snakkar om å ønskje å få historiene sine høyrte og erkjende. Vi har hatt Royal Commission her i Australia, som gav ein uavhengig prosess der offer kunne stå fram. Er det behov for noko slikt i form av ein sannings-, rettferds- og forsoningsprosess for Kyrkja internasjonalt?<br/><br/>H: Ja, eg trur det er eit behov for det internasjonalt, men eg trur først og fremst at alle lokale kyrkjer må gjere sine eigne lekser. For eg ser at det er mogleg at eit slikt råd eller ein slik utsetjing kan bli sett, så heile kyrkja kan bli frelst. Kyrkja har eit medlemskap på 1,3 milliardar menneske, og er til stades i 190 land, med alle slags ulike forventningar når det gjeld psykologisk, spirituell og økonomisk støtte.<br/><br/>Det er ein ting eg har støtt på konsekvent i samband med kommunikasjon, arbeid med og lytting til offer, og det er at dei ønskjer å bli lytta til. Så om det fanst ei kjensle av at offera stadig vart høyrt på – i Roma og andre stader – trur eg det ville vore ein stor lettelse for mange offer.<br/><br/>Eg trur [Pave Frans] er opptatt av, særleg med tanke på spørsmålet ditt, at dei lokale kyrkjene gjer alt dei kan for at offer skal bli høyrt i det aktuelle landet. Eg har ei liste over folk som ynskjer å snakke direkte til Den heilage Far, og fysisk er det umogleg. Eg var der i 2014 for å omsetje for to tyske overlevande som vart valt ut med to irske og to engelske overlevande då han fekk dei seks heime. For kvar av dei var han der i 40-45 minutt, og måtte gjere dette for kvar overlevande han ikkje fekk sove lenger.<br/><br/>Hans eksempel er å modellere for heile Den katolske kyrkja korleis offer og overlevande blir mottekne, tekne imot og høyrt på. Eg trur at om biskopane og provinsråda i denne verda, i alle land, følgde hans eksempel, ville mange overlevande verkeleg setje pris på det.<br/><br/>Erkebiskop Diarmud Martin vart nyleg sitert like før verdsmøtet for familiane, om Den pavelege kommisjonen, der han sa at den er for liten slik den for tida er sett opp til å oppnå det den treng for å oppnå. Treng kyrkja å leggje meir ressursar i korleis ho skal føre tilsyn med desse sakene?<br/><br/>For tida er vi 16 medlemmer frå stort sett alle verdsdelar, og dei største språkgruppene. Vi representerer ulike disiplinar og yrker, og føremålet med oppdraget - som dei statlege vedtektene som nettopp er kunngjort - er å gi råd til Den heilage far.<br/><br/>Ein vanleg misforståelse om kommisjonen er først og fremst at vi handsamar saker med påstandar, men det er ikkje tilfelle. Vi har ikkje rettsleg eller administrativ makt i saker, for når det gjeld påstandar om overgrep, er domstolane og saksbehandlinga fastsett.<br/><br/>Det andre er dette: ‘ Vi legg vinn på å gjera forskjell på folk. ’ For det andre: ‘ Vi legg vinn på å gjera forskjell på folk. ’<br/><br/>Så frå mitt synspunkt, ja, me treng å investere meir. Men me treng å investere meir på lokalt nivå, og me treng å sørgje for at forslaga frå Den pavelege kommisjonen vert sende vidare til Den heilage far — noko presidenten vanlegvis gjer — og så er det ein oppfølgingsprosess som reflekterer det me har gjeve som råd.<br/><br/>I Australia fører Catholic Professional Standards Limited tilsyn med Kyrkja si respons og gjev retningslinjer og støtte for å sikre at alle institusjonane i Kyrkja er barnesikre institusjonar. Er det behov for ei form for organisasjonsstøtte frå Roma for dei biskopane og bispedøma som strevar med å danne desse institusjonane og sørgje for tryggleik i desse bispedøma?<br/><br/>Eg trur at til slutt vil kommisjonen utvikle seg i den linja, og dei er no i ferd med å ansette ekspertar på desse områda.<br/><br/>Eg trur Kyrkja må forstå at dei lokale kyrkjene kan lære av kvarandre, og min forståing har alltid vore - og eg trur Den Heilage Faderen har påmint oss - at Kyrkja ikkje vil fungere som eit sentralisert samfunn. Det fungerer ikkje slik, effektivt. Kvar biskop, kvar bispekonferanse, har til ein viss grad sitt eige liv. Det vi treng å lære meir er å opne kanalar for gjensidig kommunikasjon.<br/><br/>Det er mange ting som blir skulda for mishandling i kyrkja. Som prest og psykolog, og som ein som har møtt og arbeidd med overlevande, kva er dine tankar om det?<br/><br/>Eg trur spørsmålet om kvar mishandlinga kjem frå er det viktigaste, og paven har teke opp det i sitt brev til Guds folk publisert 20. august. Han seier i første ledd, og gjentar det om og om igjen, at spørsmålet om seksuelt misbruk alltid er knytt – eller nesten alltid knytt – ikkje berre til spørsmålet om maktmisbruk, men òg til misbruk av samvitet.<br/><br/>Så det verkeleg grunnleggjande spørsmålet om misbruk er mykje meir komplekst enn berre [spørsmålet om] seksualitet – anten det er heteroseksuell eller homoseksuell. Det er eit maktspørsmål, og der må vi verkeleg arbeide med spørsmålet om korleis vi skal forstå prestedømet, korleis vi skal forstå bispedømet, korleis vi skal forstå og leve ut våre tenester? Kva er grensene?<br/><br/>Det er difor eg er svært glad for at jesuittprovinsen i Australia er i ferd med å etablere ei «Code of Conduct», fordi me snakkar ikkje berre om seksuelt misbruk av mindreårige. Vi snakkar om seksuelt misbruk av vaksne, og vi snakkar om misbruk på andre måtar – som misbruk av samvitet, der du dikterer til nokon kva du tenkjer, eller du later som om du vet av Gud, og du kan seie til ein annan at du må gjere det, mot samvitet til den personen.<br/><br/>Mange meiner at sølibat fører til mishandling. Som eg alltid seier, er sølibat som sådan ikkje årsak til misbruk – elles korleis forklarer vi at 99,9 prosent av alle misbrukarar ikkje lever eit sølibatliv, og korleis forklarer vi at 95 eller 96 prosent av alle prestar ikkje misbruker mindreårige? Men sølibat, eller eit kyskhetsløfte, som ikkje er verkeleg integrert, som ikkje er verkeleg levd ut skikkeleg - ja, som produserer eit problem. Av og til tek folk til å drikka, av og til tar dei til gambling, og av og til tar dei til seksuelt misbruk, hjå vaksne og hjå mindreårige.<br/><br/>Det verkelege spørsmålet om dette er korleis vi handsamar forestillinga om religiøs åndeleg kraft som prestar og biskopar er utstyrt med? Korleis kan teologi hjelpe oss å forstå, og kanskje korleis kan sosiologi, psykologi eller bedriftsøkonomi hjelpe oss å definere maktgrensene, og naudsynet av å halde grensene |
| I'm not surprised by this mismatch. In fact, I'd even go so far as to say this isn't something that will ever change, nor should we get all steamed up about changing it. In 10 years, we'll still have bleeding edge, complex items in the biggest concerns list, and the things we're finally getting around to understanding will be the major parts of our spending.<br/><br/>Now, Gunnar and Andy both have excellent points, specifically about IT teams seeing IT problems and solving them with IT solutions; in fact, I'm positive their points hold merit.<br/><br/>But I think there are other ideas that trump those (I did comment on their blogs about it, and later decided I should just blog here). Those top 3 concerns are bleedingly new such that:<br/><br/>we fear new things because we don't understand them, or don't understand them because they're new.<br/><br/>they're too new for us to have solid approaches to handling them.<br/><br/>they're too new for us to know if we should be worried or not! we tend to default to paranoid/worried, which is good!<br/><br/>too new to have obvious budget items assigned to them. Can I buy a box or some software that provide "cloud security" or "social media security?"<br/><br/>they're so new the business doesn't even know how to use them or what they want out of them. Let alone how we can secure them while still meeting or at least not stomping all over business needs. If the business doesn't even know how to use them yet, I'm not sure security is in any position to guide that usage securely.<br/><br/>It also should be mentioned that these new things are being largely pushed via consumerland and into the business, with IT as a sort of, "Oh yeah," thought. Firewalls, AV, AM, Auth are all IT responses to typically IT issues. Of course there is a difference there. They're also very subjective issues, as opposed to very objective items like firewalls, known malicious bits, behaviors, signatures, ports. Business presents very complex issues that are often involving people (which we can't patch) and that often don't fit nicely into blanket rules. Even if we turned away from technical solutions and devoted our time into solving these problems, they are still not going to be neatly solved. Likewise, when push comes to shove, can you have and meet goals with firewalls? Can you show improvement? All of this flows from the rather subjective non-technical aspect of those issues. Sort of the difference between a child's report card and the feedback you get from a parent-teacher conference. If you have a child, which one would you be most inclined to disagree with or not necessarily believe? (The answer is the subjective one!)<br/><br/>It could be said this is the natural progression of security and technology: from shoring up the technical controls to moving up the stack towards behavior and people. Sure, these 3 top concerns can be said to punch through firewalls and network segments, but that's the nature of those things (social media "punching" through a firewall is far different than me punching through an SSH connection to bridge my home network; social media is akin to the *way* I use my SSH connection after the hold is already punched because it is needed; i.e. social media is the way port 80 is used.)<br/><br/>Basically, all indications point to not being surprised by this dichotomy. And I don't think this is some further indication that IT/security is doing it wrong, or isn't aligned properly with business, or has a technical dark-server-room background. I'm not saying we're doing things right or we're properly aligned, but the above isn't a good argument to support the theory of those deficiencies.<br/><br/>Now for a really big jump. I'd liken the current increase in mobile computing to be as big as the introduction of computers into the business and later the PC/internet into business. Now, I wasn't around when the former happened, nor was I in the industry when the personal computer revolution swept into business, but I would bet that is the closest comparison so far. I may even say the same for social media. These are damned new and they're big changes beyond just bringing in Macs or new software or some new business process. | Eg er ikkje overraska over denne mismatchen. Faktisk vil eg gå så langt som til å seie at dette ikkje er noko som nokon gong vil endra seg, og vi bør heller ikkje bli opphista av å endra det. Om 10 år vil me framleis ha blømande kant, komplekse element på lista over dei største bekymringane, og dei tinga me endeleg kjem til å forstå vil vere dei største delane av utgiftene våre.<br/><br/>Gunnar og Andy har begge gode poeng, særleg om at IT-team ser på IT-problem og løyser dei med IT-løysingar; eg er faktisk positiv til at poenga deira er gode.<br/><br/>Men eg trur det er andre idear som trumfer dei (eg kommenterte på bloggene deira om det, og seinare bestemte eg meg for at eg berre skulle blogge her).<br/><br/>vi fryktar nye ting fordi vi ikkje skjønar dei, eller skjønar dei ikkje fordi dei er nye.<br/><br/>dei er for nye for oss til å ha solide tilnærmingar til å handtere dei.<br/><br/>dei er for nye for oss å vite om vi skal vere engstelege eller ikkje! me har ein tendens til å standardisere til paranoid/bekymra, noko som er bra!<br/><br/>Eg er for ny til å ha tydelege budsjettelement tildelt dei. Kan eg kjøpa ein boks eller noko programvare som gjev «skysikkerheit» eller «tryggleik i sosiale medium?»<br/><br/>Dei er så nye at verksemda ikkje ein gong veit korleis dei skal brukast eller kva dei vil ha ut av dei. Endå mindre korleis vi kan sikre dei medan vi enno møter eller i det minste ikkje trampar på alle forretningsbehov. Om verksemda ikkje ein gong veit korleis dei skal brukast enno, er eg ikkje sikker på at tryggleiken er i nokon posisjon til å rettleie den bruken sikkert.<br/><br/>Det bør òg nemnast at desse nye tinga i stor grad blir pressa via forbrukarland og inn i verksemda, med IT som ein slags «Å ja», tenkte ein. Brannmurar, AV, AM, Auth er alle IT-svar på typiske IT-problem. Sjølvsagt er det ein skilnad der. Dei er òg veldig subjektive problem, i motsetnad til veldig objektive element som brannmurar, kjende skadelege bitar, åtferd, signaturar, portar. Næringslivet presenterer svært komplekse problemstillingar som ofte involverer folk (som vi ikkje kan lappa til), og som ofte ikkje passar godt inn i generelle reglar. Sjølv om vi vende oss bort frå tekniske løysingar og brukte tida på å løyse desse problema, vil dei likevel ikkje bli løyste på ein klår måte. På same måte, når push kjem til å dytte, kan du ha og møte mål med brannmurar? Kan du vise forbetring? Alt dette kjem frå det heller subjektive, ikkje-tekniske aspektet ved desse problemstillingane. På ein måte skil det seg frå tilbakemeldinga du får frå ein foreldre-lærar-konferanse. Om du har eit barn, kva er det du er mest tilbøyelig til å vere usamd med eller ikkje nødvendigvis tru på? (Svaret er det subjektive!)<br/><br/>Ein kan seie at dette er den naturlege progresjonen til tryggleik og teknologi: frå å forkorte dei tekniske kontrollane til å gå opp stabelen mot åtferd og folk. Jada, desse 3 øvste bekymringane kan seiast å slå gjennom brannmurar og nettverkssegment, men det er naturen til desse tinga (sosiale media "punching" gjennom ein brannmur er langt annleis enn meg som slår gjennom ein SSH-tilkopling for å brua heimenettverket mitt; sosiale media er lik * måten * eg bruker min SSH-tilkopling etter at haldet alt er slått fordi det er naudsynt; dvs. sosiale media er måten 80 port<br/><br/>I hovudsak tyder alt på at du ikkje er overraska over denne dikotomien. Og eg trur ikkje dette er noko vidare indikasjon på at IT/tryggleik gjer det gale, eller ikkje er rett innretta med business, eller har ein teknisk mørk-tenar-rom-bakgrunn. Eg seier ikkje at me gjer ting rett eller me er rett innretta, men det over er ikkje eit godt argument for å støtte teorien om desse manglane.<br/><br/>No for eit veldig stort sprang. Eg vil likne den noverande auken i mobil databehandling til å vere så stor som introduksjonen av datamaskiner i næringslivet og seinare PC / internett i næringslivet. No var eg ikkje i nærleiken då det førstnemnde skjedde, og eg var heller ikkje i bransjen då den personlege datamaskinrevolusjonen feide inn i næringslivet, men eg vil vedde på at det er den næraste samanlikninga så langt. Eg kan til og med seie det same for sosiale media. Desse er forbanna nye og dei er store endringar utover berre å ta inn Mac-ar eller ny programvare eller ein eller annan ny forretningsprosess. |

Older posts state that battery health doesnt work with aftermarket batteries, yet some people post that newer batteries now support this feature. I am thinking about ordering a replacement battery for iPhone 6 and am curious if the feature will work or not.<br/>If it doesnt work, then is there any way to tell if the phone is throttled other than running a benchmark? | 01/10/2019<br/><br/>Tittel:<br/><br/>Fungerar erstatningsbatterier med batterihelsefunksjonen no?<br/><br/>Tekst:<br/><br/>Det er mykje blanda info om dette. Eldre innlegg seier at batterihelse ikkje fungerer med ettermarknadsbatterier, men det er likevel nokre som skriv at nyare batteri no støttar denne funksjonen. Eg tenkjer på å bestille eit erstatningsbatteri til iPhone 6 og er spent på om funksjonen vil fungere eller ikkje.<br/>Om det ikkje fungerer, er det då nokon måte å seie om telefonen er strupa anna enn å køyre ein referanse? |
