| Smith Chuck - Through the Bible C2000 SeriesShall we turn to the book of Acts, chapter one, as we begin our study of the early church.<br/>Luke, the author of the book of Acts, a companion of Paul the apostle, who was author also of the Gospel According to Luke, wrote these two treatises to a friend, Theophilus. Theophilus is a Greek name. It's a name that has a beautiful meaning. The name means lover of God. There are some who believe that it was not a man at all, but that the gospel and the book of Acts were addressed to the lovers of God, whoever you may be. There are other traditions that say that Theophilus was actually Luke's master. That in those days physicians were slaves, usually the slave of a wealthy patron. So that Luke's master was Theophilus, and he released Luke to be with Paul on the missionary journeys. Thus, Luke is writing back to his former master. This is an early tradition of the church, but it is, of course, impossible to prove, like so many of the traditions.<br/>There are also those who believe that when Paul was in Troas and he received a vision of a man calling unto him saying, "Come over to Macedonia and help us," that that man in Paul's vision was none other than Luke. For the first one that Paul really met when he came to Macedonia was Luke. And as we are in the book of Acts, you will find that when we get to that portion of the book of Acts, Luke begins to write more in the first person rather than the third person. So it is, evidently, at this particular point in the Acts of the Apostles that Luke became a companion of Paul and began to journey with him. He began to use the pronouns "we" and "us" instead of "they" and "them." This is, no doubt, where Luke became a participant and an eyewitness of those things that were happening from this point on. We will bring this out to you when we get to that point.<br/>He begins the Acts of the Apostles by tying it with the Gospel According to Luke. It is interesting that the very last thing that Luke records in his gospel is the very first thing he records in the Acts of the Apostles. We find the gospel of Luke closing as Jesus is telling His disciples to wait in Jerusalem until they be endued with power from on high. And then Jesus ascended up into heaven, and so he closes the gospel. In opening the Acts of the Apostles, he writes,<br/>The former treatise [that is, the Gospel According to Luke,] have I written unto you, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and teach ( Act 1:1 ),<br/>The key word is began. The Gospel According to Luke is not the full story of the ministry of Jesus Christ. It is only the beginning of the ministry of Jesus Christ. Jesus continues to minister to the needs of people. Jesus continues to heal the sick. Jesus continues to raise the dead. Jesus continues to minister His love and His gospel to the world, only now He is ministering through those disciples who have been anointed with His Holy Spirit. But the ministry of Christ is continuing; basically, is the premise that Luke takes in the Acts of the Apostles. The former treatise of all that Jesus began, both to do and to teach.<br/>Now because of that, the Acts of the Apostles is an unfinished book: in that the Lord today continues to work through the lives of those who have dedicated themselves to be the instruments of God. To be led and guided and anointed by His Holy Spirit, to continue the ministry of Jesus in the world today. Now God has ordained that His work should be accomplished through human instruments. I do not say that it must be accomplished. God can use angelic beings for His work, and there will come a time, during the book of Revelation when God will use angels to proclaim His gospel to people all over the world. Revelation, chapter 14, "The first angel flying through the midst of heaven having the everlasting gospel" ( Rev 14:6 ). But at the present time, God has chosen to use human instruments. As imperfect as they may be, yet that's what God has ordained to use. The exciting thing about that is, God will use me and God will use you. So many times, we're begging off, "O Lord, I can't speak. I've never been able to speak before or even now, Lord." As Moses tried to beg off the call of God. Jeremiah said, "Lord, I'm just a kid; no one's going to listen to me." And we all have our excuses why we can't be used. Don't we? We all know the reasons why God couldn't use us.<br/>One time, as the Lord was calling a prophet to do His work, he said, "Lord, send whoever you want." The Lord said, "Hey, I've called you." "Lord, good idea; send whoever you want." So often we're in that position, "Lord, send by the hand of whomsoever you will, anybody but me Lord." And yet, God has ordained to use us.<br/>Now, each of us can show our own imperfections. Each of us can point out our own inabilities, and all of us can find an excuse why God wouldn't want to use me. But yet, God has chosen to use you. That through your life He might reveal Himself to a needy world. You wonder when God has such instruments to use how He ever got the job done, don't you?<br/>Until the day in which he was taken up, after that he through the Holy Spirit had given commandments to the apostles whom he had chosen ( Act 1:2 ):<br/>That is what he ended the Gospel of Luke with. The day that Jesus was taken up, after He had told the apostles to wait for the endowment of power.<br/>To whom he also [that is the apostles he also] showed himself alive to them after his passion [or death] by many infallible proofs ( Act 1:3 ),<br/>It is difficult to deny the fact of the resurrection of Jesus Christ. I was amused, as well as annoyed and irritated, by an article I read in the Santa Ana Register this last Saturday. Of the creation science and evolutionary theories being presented in the county schools. How that, this one professor said that he teaches a science class, and thus, they deal only in facts, and that they don't have any place for theories. Because science is based upon fact and creation is based upon religious superstitions. It takes a lot of faith to believe the religious theories. When you are dealing with facts, you can just accept them. I thought, "Very interesting in that science class, they taught me it was a fact that the world was four billion years old. Now today they are teaching it's a fact that the world is twelve billion years old. And it wasn't that long ago that I went to school."<br/>It's interesting that the Bible has never needed to be revised or updated to meet the current data that men have discovered. And yet, if you would take my high school science textbooks today and try to teach a science class from them, you would find that many of the things that were taught as scientific fact when I was in high school are no longer recognized as scientific fact. The simple cell protoplasm is no longer a simple cell, but extremely complex. If there is any fact that can be attested to in history it is the fact of the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.<br/>We have a jurisprudence system that is based upon the testimony of witnesses. If a man is accused of a crime and there are people who witnessed that crime while it was being committed, and they are brought to the standard, and they swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help them God. And in their questioning they affirm that, "I saw that man in the bank on May twenty-third. I saw him pull out a gun from his coat. I heard him demand that all of the money be given to him. I saw him as he left the bank. I saw him as the officer apprehended him outside." And if you can get three or four witnesses to point to that man and will keep their testimony under cross-examination, that man is judged to be guilty. He is the one who did it. We have two or three witnesses that are testifying the same story about that man, and it is accepted as fact that he is the one who perpetrated the crime and is guilty. You've got witnesses who have sworn to tell the truth that are verifying.<br/>After the death of Jesus, when He rose again, He appeared unto many different people who gave sworn testimony that they saw Him. That they talked to Him, that He appeared to them in various places under different circumstances. And for a period of forty days was visiting with them. And at one time, up to as many as five hundred people who were gathered at one place, He appeared. It's difficult to just cast aside or deny the witness of these people. To do so is to discredit our whole jurisprudence system. But not only that, these men who testified that they saw the risen Lord, that they talked to Him, that they ate with Him, they, all of them, with the exception of one, met violent deaths at the hands of other people because of their affirming that the story they told was true. You talk about witnesses sworn to tell the truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth. If a person's life was threatened because of that witness, and it was a lie, at least one them would've broken under the pressure. They would've confessed to the entire hoax. "He showed Himself alive after His passion by many infallible proofs."<br/>being seen of them for forty days, speaking to them of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God ( Act 1:3 ):<br/>Sometimes we fault the disciples because of their questions of the timing of the kingdom of God. Let it be remembered that the kingdom of God was the favorite subject of Jesus Christ. He was always talking about the kingdom of God, and it is a great hope that He was planting into the hearts of all men. Things are not always going to continue corrupted as they are. The world is not going to go forever under the power of darkness, under the bondage of evil. God is going to one day establish His kingdom upon the earth. A kingdom of righteous joy and peace. "Jesus shall reign, where ere the sun doth her successive journeys run. And His kingdom will extend from shore to shore." And that day will be the most glorious day the world has ever seen, as sickness and suffering and pain will be abolished in His kingdom. As sin and greed and these things that have made the world such an intolerable place will be abolished in His kingdom. The godless commercialism, the exploitation of man, all of these things abolished in His glorious kingdom when He reigns. No wonder the disciples were anxious to get it on. I'm anxious to get it on; I'm anxious for His kingdom to come. And Jesus told us when we pray, the first petition is, "Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven" ( Mat 6:10 ). This is the right kind of a desire that we should all have. I desire the kingdom of God. And so He was talking to them, during this forty-day period, of the kingdom.<br/>And, being assembled together with them, he commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which, saith he, you have heard of me ( Act 1:4 ).<br/>He said, "Now look, wait here in Jerusalem until you receive the promise of the Father." This promise that He is referring to is, no doubt, the promise in Joel where the Lord promised, "And it shall come to pass in the later days, saith the Lord, that I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and daughters will prophesy, and your young men shall dream dreams, your old men shall see visions: and upon my servants and my handmaidens shall I pour out my Spirit, saith the Lord" ( Joe 2:28-29 ). The promise of the Father: the day is going to come when God is going to pour out His Spirit upon all flesh, all of the believers. They will, each one, receive that dynamic from God.<br/>For John [He said,] truly baptized with water; but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now ( Act 1:5 ).<br/>The idea of baptism was that of emersion, the bapteedzo. John baptized with water, submerged the people in water, "you're going to be submerged in the Holy Spirit in not many days."<br/>Now when they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, will you at this time restore the kingdom to Israel? ( Act 1:6 )<br/>"When is it going to be, Lord? When's the time for this restoration?" And Jesus is talking to them now, not about the kingdom, but about the power that they're going to receive for service. And so He brushes aside their question.<br/>Saying unto them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father has put in his own power ( Act 1:7 ).<br/>"It's not for you to know." They lived constantly in the anticipation of the immediate setting up of the kingdom. During the entire lifetime of Jesus, they were expecting Him at any moment to go into the phone booth and come out as the savior of the world. Shazzam! Showing His power and overthrowing the governments of the world, establishing God's kingdom upon the earth. And they were waiting daily for this change to transpire. And whenever Jesus would talk about going to Jerusalem, being turned over into the hands of sinful man, and then being crucified, "Oh, oh no, Lord. No, no you don't understand the kingdom, Lord. Be that far from Thee." When Jesus died on the cross, they were all greatly disappointed.<br/>The two disciples on the road to Emmaus, so sad. "Hey, fellows. How come you're so sad as your walking along?" "What do you mean? You must be a stranger around here if you don't know the things that have been happening lately in Jerusalem." "What things?" "Oh, a fellow by the name of Jesus of Nazareth...oh man, it was mighty and powerful. The anointing of God was upon His life. We had hoped that in Him was the deliverance of Israel, but they crucified Him. We had hoped . . . now it's dead." Now He's risen, and He's saying, "In a few days, fellows, you're going to receive the promise of the Father." "Oh, what promise? The promise of the establishing of the kingdom?" You see, it was legitimate that they should ask. "Is this it Lord? Alright! Is this the time? Are you going to set up your kingdom now?" "No. It's not for you to know those times that the Father's appointed or that the Father has in His own power. But, you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you."<br/>Now here, the Greek preposition epi is used to signify a new relationship that they were to have with the Holy Spirit. In the Gospel According to John, chapter 14, as Jesus is there promising to send the Holy Spirit, He said, "I will not leave you comfortless. I will come to you, and I will pray the Father, and He will send to you another comforter, even the Spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth Him not neither knows Him, but you know Him for He dwells with you, and He shall be in you" ( Joh 14:17-18 ). Same Greek preposition as ours, only they spell it "en" instead of "in." Two-fold relationship there in John: He is with you, but He's going to be dwelling in you. But now Jesus said you're going to receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you. The Greek preposition epi, which is translated in different texts throughout the New Testament as "upon" or "over" or I like it, "overflows."<br/>In the seventh chapter of the gospel of John: "On the last day, the great day of the feast when Jesus stood there on the Temple Mount and cried to the people, 'If any man thirst let him come unto Me and drink: and he who drinks of the water that I give, out of his innermost being there will gush torrents of living water.'" John said, "This spake He of the Spirit, which was not yet given which they who believe on Him should receive" ( Joh 7:37-39 ). What did He speak of the Spirit? That it would be like a torrent of living water flowing out. I like, "When the Spirit overflows you," upon you, or over you, or overflows from you. So the three-fold relationship: He is with you prior to your conversion, He is the one who causes you to realize that you are a sinner, He is the one who points to Jesus Christ as the answer as He convinces the world of sin, of righteous, and of judgment. The moment you open your life and heart to Jesus Christ and invite Him to come in, the Holy Spirit comes and begins to indwell you. He shall be in you. "Know ye not that you are not your own, you have been bought with a price, therefore glorify God in your body and your spirit which are His. And know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit which is in you? Be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess, but be filled, or be ye being filled with the Spirit" ( 1Co 6:19-20 ,Eph 5:18 ). But now here's a third relationship. This is an empowering experience.<br/>You will receive [the dunamus] the dynamics, when the Holy Spirit has come [epi] upon you [or over you, or when there is that overflow from you]: and ye shall be witnesses unto me ( Act 1:8 )<br/>And so the dynamic, to be a witness for Jesus Christ. It is interesting that the word witness in Greek is the word martus from where we get our word martyr. And in Greek it does mean martyr. A witness is one who not only proclaims what he believes, he lives what he believes, he is what he believes, and he believes it so strongly, that if necessary, he'll die for what he believes. That's how strong is his belief. He's a martus. You can't stop him. He's not afraid to die for what he believes.<br/>You remember when Paul was on his way back to Jerusalem and Agabus came down from Caesarea and he took Paul's girdle and tied himself up and he said, "So is the man who owns this girdle to be bound when he gets to Jerusalem." And Paul's friends began to weep, saying, "Oh, Paul, don't go, don't go." And he said, "What do you mean by these tears? Do you think you're going to dissuade me? Do you think I'm worried about being bound? I'm ready to die." He was a martus. "I'm ready to die." Being put to death for your faith did not make you a martyr; because you were a martyr, you were put to death. Because you were a witness, because you believed it so strong. So, it did not make you a witness, it only proved what you were. You were a witness all along. If you hadn't been a martus, you would've never gone to your death. You would've recanted; you would've said, "Whoa, whoa, wait, wait. Hold on, let's change course here. I think that I may have made a mistake." Then you say, "Well, he wasn't a martus. Stealing a horse doesn't make you a horse thief; it only proves that you were. No one steals a horse unless he's a horse thief. So, stealing it doesn't make you a horse thief, it only proves that you were all along. Being martyred only proves what you were a witness, a martus. "And you will be witnesses." And isn't it interesting that most of them were martyred? "Witnesses unto Me."<br/>The witness was to be both in Jerusalem, and in all of Judea ( Act 1:8 ),<br/>The witness began right at home. The hardest place, isn't it? It's to start right at home in Jerusalem, and then the area around Jerusalem, the area of Judea. And then it was to spread up into Samaria. And then it was to go out into the uttermost parts of the world. And as we study the book of Acts, we will see this very progression. How the witness began in Jerusalem. We'll get that in the next chapter. And then we'll see how it began to spread through out Judea. And then Phillip went up into Samaria, and then finally Paul and Barnabas are called to go into the uttermost parts of the world. And so the witness spread through the anointing and the empowering of the Holy Spirit.<br/>Now when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight ( Act 1:9 ).<br/>This is the final promise made by Jesus to His disciples. This is it, the final words prior to His ascension. Of course, later He came and talked to Paul and others, but prior to His ascension, this is His final word. And upon this, when He had spoken these things, while they were watching Him, He was taken up and a cloud received Him out of their sight.<br/>And while they were looking steadfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, there were two men who stood by them in white apparel ( Act 1:10 );<br/>We assume they were angels.<br/>Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as you have seen him go into heaven ( Act 1:11 ).<br/>They saw Him as He ascended up into heaven and they will behold Him when He comes again. "Behold the Lord cometh with ten thousands of His saints, to execute judgement upon the earth" (Jud 1:14-15). And then, "Unto Him who loved us and gave Himself for us and who has made us unto our God, kings and priests who shall reign with Him upon the earth, behold the Lord cometh, and every eye shall see Him, and they also who pierced Him shall mourn" Rev 1:5-7 ). So the Lord's coming. Every eye shall see Him. The Jehovah Witnesses say that He is already come, but it was a secret coming. As it was only the disciples that saw Him go, it was only the disciples, of the Jehovah Witnesses, who saw Him return. But Jesus said, "If they say unto you, 'He has come in secret and has gone into a secret chamber don't believe it'" ( Mat 24:26 ). So you have to choose, to believe Jesus or them.<br/>"This same Jesus which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as you've seen Him go into heaven."<br/>Now there's a very interesting verse in II John, verse Act 1:7 , "For many deceivers are entered into the world who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh." That, unfortunately, is a poor translation of the Greek. For this participle is in the present tense and should be translated "is coming in the flesh." Those who would deny that Jesus Christ is coming in the flesh. What does John say of them? "They are a deceiver and an antichrist. Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward. For whosoever transgresses and abides not in the doctrine of Christ, has not God. He that abides in the doctrine of Christ, he has both the Father and the Son. And if there come any unto your door (on Saturday morning) and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, and neither bid him good-bye. For he that bids him good-bye is a partaker of his evil deeds" (2Jn 1:7-11). Ask them one question, "Is Jesus coming in the flesh?" Just ask them that question. And if they say no, just remember what John warned you and what John told you. "If any confess not that Jesus Christ is coming in the flesh." Do you remember when He was with the disciples and He said, "Give me something to eat"? He said, "You know, spirits don't eat; touch me. See? It's me." So, this same Jesus is coming again in the same manner in which they saw Him go into heaven. And I, for one, believe that that coming is very soon.<br/>Then retuned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a Sabbath's day journey [about two-thirds of a mile]. And when they were come in, they went up into an upper room, where there abode both Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, and Phillip, and Thomas, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon Zelotes, and Judas the brother of James. And these all continued in one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers ( Act 1:12-14 ).<br/>This is the last mention of Mary the mother of Jesus. At this point and from this point on, there is no further mention of her in the Acts of the Apostles or in the epistles. No mention of her death or of her miraculous ascension into heaven, without death. Nothing is mentioned in the scripture. It is silent.<br/>His brethren would be a reference probably to James and to Jude and to those other brothers who were sons of Joseph and Mary.<br/>The upper room--there are some who say that it is the same upper room in which Jesus had the Last Supper with His disciples. And yet, there are others who hold to this upper room being a room in the temple precincts where the early church met. Take your choice.<br/>And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples, and said, (the number of their names together were about one hundred and twenty,) men and brethren, this Scripture must needs have been fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit by the mouth of David spake before concerning Judas, which was a guide to those who took Jesus ( Act 1:15-16 ).<br/>Here again, Peter still his same impetuous self. They're waiting in prayer and supplication, and Peter stands up and says, "Fellows, there's a scripture that's gotta be fulfilled." And you know he's going to move ahead, "Let's get the program going; let's cast lots and find out who's going to take Judas' place." I do feel that Peter was again in the flesh, manifesting that impetuous nature that was his. And I think that the future history of the church in the book of Acts points this out. I am interested in Peter's understanding of the scriptures, how that he is quoting from so many places in the Old Testament. Peter does manifest a very great understanding of the Old Testament scriptures which is a point in his favor.<br/>Notice that Peter ascribes to the Holy Spirit those things that David wrote. So that, "All scripture is given by inspiration of God" ( 2Ti 3:16 ). Not part of the scriptures. Because, if you tell me that part of the scriptures are given by inspiration of God, then I must ask you, "What parts are by inspiration and what parts are not by inspiration?" And then you are then the authority who tells me what part I can believe and what part I can't believe. And the minute that God is no longer the authority but you're the authority, I'm in trouble. Beware of those who say, "Well, you can't believe all of the scriptures." The scriptures themselves say, "All scripture is given by inspiration of God." And here, Luke in writing of what Peter was saying, declares that David was actually the spokesman for the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit, by the mouth of David, spake concerning Judas.<br/>For he was numbered with us, [he was one of the twelve] he had obtained a part of this ministry. But now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity; and falling headlong ( Act 1:17-18 ),<br/>He purchased the field, the potter's field as Zachariah the eleventh chapter declares.<br/>and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all of his bowels gushed out ( Act 1:18 ).<br/>There are those who find a discrepancy in the scriptures, because in one of the gospels we are told that when Judas came back and tried to return the money, and they said, "Hey, it's your problem. We can't take it." And put it back in the temple treasury. "It's blood money." Then he threw it there on the floor of the temple and he went out and hung himself. Here Peter tells us that he fell headlong and just popped. And there are those who imagine a discrepancy. Very simple, he went up into the tree to hang himself, tied the rope around his neck and tied it to the limb and jumped. And the force of the fall either snapped the rope or his head, and he fell on down into the canyon and just as he said it here.<br/>It was known to all of the dwellers at Jerusalem; insomuch that the field is called in their tongue, Aceldama, that is to say, The field of blood. For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be desolate, and let no man dwell therein: and, His bishoprick let another take ( Act 1:19-20 ).<br/>Now in reality he's quoting from two different Psalms here. From Psa 69:25 ,he puts it together with Psa 109:8 . And putting the two together he finds these prophecies concerning Judas.<br/>Wherefore of these men ( Act 1:21 )<br/>Now here is where they are looking for someone to take Judas' place to be an apostle. Here are the qualifications they looked for in that time.<br/>Wherefore of these men which have companied with us all the time that the Lord Jesus when in and out among us ( Act 1:21 ),<br/>Now you remember there were many disciples, many disciples of which Jesus chose ten to be apostles. And the word apostle means "one who is sent out." Or chose twelve to be apostles, so He sent out the twelve. The number of human government. "We only have eleven. We need one to take Judas' place, but we need one who has been with us all the while from the beginning with Jesus."<br/>From the time he was baptized by John, until the day he was taken up from us, must one be ordained to be a witness [of what?] of His resurrection ( Act 1:22 ).<br/>So these were the requirements they were looking for. Someone who had been around the whole while. From the time of John's baptism to the ascension. And one who saw the risen Lord, and thus could bear fact of the resurrection, their testimony to the fact.<br/>Now Paul the apostle, later in asserting the fact that he was an apostle said, "Have I not seen the risen Christ?" Evidently that was one of the requirements of apostleship. Someone asked me, "Are there apostles today?" Well, I don't know. I don't think that there are in the same sense that they were in the New Testament. Surely there is none today who can bear witness to the resurrection as they did.<br/>They appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias. And they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord, which knowest the hearts of all men, show whether of these two that you have chosen ( Act 1:23-24 ),<br/>I think that we often make this mistake of giving the Lord two choices, both wrong. Limiting God, you see. We're so prone to do this. Obviously, Paul was God's choice. Peter was impetuous, and jumping the gun said, "Hey, we've got to do something, you know, gotta help God out. You know, one's missing and we've got to fill him in." And yet, "God, which one of these two do you want?" And giving God the two choices.<br/>That he may take part of this ministry and this apostleship, from which Judas by the transgression fell, that he might go to his own place. And so they gave forth their lots ( Act 1:25-26 );<br/>An interesting way by which they sought to determine the will of God. Let's throw dice, find out what God's will is here. It's interesting to me, the various ways that people have devised to discern the will of God. Now, in the Old Testament times they had an interesting way of coming to the priest, who would inquire of the Lord for them through the Urim and the Thummim, the "lights and perfections." Just what these Urim and Thummim were, we don't know. I'm sure they were not the colored glasses that Joseph Smith found with the Golden Tablets; the magic glasses, that when you put them on, you could suddenly read the hieroglyphic writing.<br/>There are those who say that the Urim and Thummim were actually a black and a white stone that was worn in a pouch on the chest of the priest. They would pray and ask the Lord a particular question. You remember that David was asking the Lord definite questions: "Lord, shall we go out against the Philistines?" The answer was, "No." So again, the next day, "Lord, shall we go out against the Philistines?" The answer was, "Yes." "When shall we go?" They would ask specific questions, and the Lord would direct them through the Urim and the Thummin. They say that the priest would pray, seek God, and then reach in and pull out one of the two stones. If it was the white stone, it was a yes answer. If it was a no, then it would be the black stone that he would pull out. Some even say we get the term blackballed from this Urim and Thummim. Actually, back in the original it is a no vote against a particular project or idea. Just what the Urim and Thummim were, we don't know. But during the Old Testament period, they did use a method of casting lots to determine the will of God.<br/>So here the disciples are picking up on the same thing as they are throwing the dice to see which of the two fellows that God had chosen to replace Judas Iscariot.<br/>the lot fell on Matthias; he was numbered with the eleven ( Act 1:26 ).<br/>Now who in the world is Matthias? No one ever heard of him before or since. It'll be interesting to meet Matthias and find out who he is and what he did. I think from the subsequent history, it's obvious to assume that God chose Paul as an apostle. Paul declares it himself. Now this is the last time we ever read of them seeking to discern the will of God by the casting of lots or by a chance kind of a thing.<br/>I know a fellow today, in seeking to discern the will of the Lord, will pray and ask the Lord a question. He'll have ten pennies in his pocket, and as he's praying, he'll take the pennies with his eyes closed and put them down on the table, and if they all come up heads, it's a yes. An interesting thing, every once in a while, they'll all come up heads, and that's pretty good odds. Yet, we don't find any pattern for this after the Holy Spirit was given. Once the Holy Spirit came upon the church, then the Holy Spirit began to speak to them and direct them. And the Holy Spirit said, "Separate unto me Paul and Barnabas for the ministry where I have called them" ( Act 13:2 ). And the Holy Spirit sent them forth. So we find the church more directly guided by the Holy Spirit. Once the Holy Spirit came, this throwing dice to find out the will of God was set aside.<br/>"<br/><br/>King James Version<br/><br/>This is the 1769 King James Version of the Holy Bible (also known as the Authorized Version). "Public Domain" | Smith Chuck - Gjennom bibelserien C2000Skal vi vende oss til Apostlenes gjerninger, kapittel 1, når vi byrjar studiet av den tidlege kyrkja.<br/>Lukas, som har skrive Apostlenes gjerninger, saman med apostelen Paulus, skreiv desse to bøkene til venen sin Teofilos: « Teofilos er eit vakkert namn som gjev gode tydingar. Den som elskar Gud, har aldri vore eit menneske, men dei som i Guds auge har halde fram med å elska han, det er evangeliet og den boka som Gud har gjeve dei. Det finst òg dei som har sagt at Teofilos var lærar til Lukas. Den gongen var dei lækjarar og herskarar i folket, og det var dei som dyrka Gud. Teofilos, som var lærar for Lukas, sleppte han fri og gav han fri då han skulle fara med Paulus. Dette er ein tidleg tradisjon i kyrkja, men det er sjølvsagt umogeleg å bevise, som så mange av tradisjonane.<br/>Nokre trudde òg at Paulus var i Troas, og no kom dei til han og bad han: « Kom over til Makedonia og hjelp oss! » For dei såg at det ikkje var nokon annan enn Lukas. For då Paulus kom til Makedonia, vart det heller ikkje lettare for han å skriva kva som helst i boka. Det var på same måten som då han kom til Makedonia, og han vart verande der. Såleis var det med Lukas, bror hans, på denne tida. Han gjekk omkring og tala med Paulus og brukte pronomena « vi », « oss », « dei » og « dei ». Men ikkje eingong Lukas, som sjølv vitnar om dette, står fram med si eiga hand. Han skal òg vitna om det som har hendt frå først av, så vi kan bera det fram for dykk.<br/>Det er interessant at det aller siste som Lukas nedteiknar i sitt evangelium, er det aller første som han nedteiknar i Apostelgjerningane. For han trudde at evangeliet hadde vorte fullenda i Jerusalem, og at læresveinane hans derifrå skulle venta på at det skulle koma nokon frå det høge. Då vart han teken opp til himmelen og forkynte for dei.<br/>I den første boka mi, gode Teofilos, skreiv eg til deg om alt det Jesus gjorde og lærte, frå han begynte<br/>Evangeliet etter Lukas er ikkje heile Jesu Kristi evangelium, men det var då tenesta som skulle fullførast. Jesus gjekk inn i heilagdomen, tok til orde og lækte dei sjuke. Men no, i desse siste dagar, har han tala til oss gjennom Den heilage ande og til dei heilage som han har salva. Han er vår Herre og Gud. Men i det første står det om han at han skal halda fram med alt det han har gjort og lært, frå den første pakta med Jesus Kristus.<br/>Men alt dette er berre byrjinga på fødselsriene. Herren sjølv vitnar i dei gjerningane som høyrer menneske til, korleis dei kan gjera Guds gjerningar. Eg meiner at det er rett å halda dykk vakne med slike påbod, ikkje av menneskehender, men av Gud. Gud kan bruka englar til sitt verk, og det vil koma ei tid, under Åpenbaringsboka, då Gud vil bruka englar til å forkynna sitt evangelium for folk over heile verda. Åp 14, "Den fyrste engelen som flaug under det høgste av himmelen hadde eit evig evangelium" (Åp 14,6). Men no har Gud valt å bruka menneskelege verkty. Så ufullkomen dei enn måtte vere, men det er det som Gud har bestemt skal brukast. Gud vil bruka meg, og Gud vil bruka deg. Mange gonger bed vi: ‘ Herre, eg kan ikkje tala, Herre! ’ eller: ‘ Aldri har eg tala, Herre! ’ slik Moses freista å venda om. Då sa Jeremia: « Herre, eg er ung; det er ingen som høyrer på meg. » Og ingen av oss har nokon grunn til å vera uvitande, endå vi alle kjenner til grunnen til at vi ikkje kan vera uvitande.<br/>Ein gong Herren kalla ein profet, sa han: « Herre, send han! » Han svara: « Ja, eg har kalla deg. Herre, send den du vil. » og sa: « Herre, send oss! » Men han svara: « Ikkje eingong eg, Herre! Kven du så er. »<br/>Vi har nok full rett til livsopphald, men vi ville gje dykk eit føredøme så de kunne etterlikna oss. Ja, de har etterlikna oss. Og endå er de hovmodige! De skulle heller sørgja, så den som har gjort dette, kunne bli utstøytt frå dykk.<br/>og heilt til den dagen han vart teken opp til himmelen. Då hadde han ved Den heilage ande gjeve sine påbod til dei apostlane han hadde valt ut.<br/>Dette var slutten på Lukas-evangeliet, då Jesus vart teken opp til himmelen. Han sa til apostlane at dei skulle venta på han som skulle koma.<br/>3 og etter mange ubrigdelege vitnemål synte han seg levande for dei, etter at han hadde lide døden.<br/>Det er vanskeleg å nekta for Jesu Kristi oppstode. Eg vart underhalda, irritert og irritert av ein artikkel eg las i Santa Ana-registeret sist laurdag. Om kreasjonsvitskapen og evolusjonsteoriane som blir presentert i fylkesskulen. Korleis det, denne eine professoren sa at han underviser i ein vitskapsklasse, og dermed handlar dei berre om fakta, og at dei ikkje har nokon plass for teoriar. For det ligg ikkje noko anna i det vi seier; det ligg i det vi seier, og det vi seier, ikkje i det vi seier og ikkje gjer. Men det vi seier, gjer vi. Eg tenkte, "Veldig interessant i den vitskapstimen, dei lærte meg at det var eit faktum at verda var fire milliardar år gamal. No lærer dei i dag at det er eit faktum at verda er tolv milliardar år gamal. Og det var ikkje så lenge sidan eg gjekk på skulen.»<br/>Det er interessant at Bibelen aldri har trengt å bli revidert eller oppdatert for å møte dei noverande dataa som menneska har oppdaga. Og likevel, om du tok fagbøkene mine på high school i dag og prøvde å undervise ein vitskapsklasse ut frå dei, ville du funne at mange av dei tinga som vart undervist som vitskapelege fakta då eg gjekk på high school, ikkje lenger blir rekna som vitskapelege fakta. Den enkle celleprotoplasmaen er ikkje lenger ei enkel celle, men ein svært komplisert celle. Om det er noko som kan vitnast i historia, så er det at Jesus Kristus stod opp frå dei døde.<br/>Vi har eit rettssystem som er basert på vitneutsagn. Dei som klaga på han, fekk høyra at dei skulle gå til grunne.}} No kan ein som blir klaga, sjølv om dei har vitnemål mot han, sjølv sverja på det, at han både er sannferdig og utan sanning.}} og sa: « Eg såg mannen stå der inne den tjuetredje mai. Han drog ei pistol mot hovudet sitt og sa: ‘ Betal meg alt det du eig! ’ Og då han gjekk ut, fekk eg sjå han. Og eg såg at han heldt seg utanfor. Men når du har tre eller fire vitne imot deg, skal du forhøyra han; for denne skulda skulda skal du svara for det. Så er det to eller tre som vitnar: ‘ Den mannen har skulda Gud for noko som han ikkje veit av, han har gjort seg skuldig i brot på. ’ Og dei har svore på at det er sanninga i dette.<br/>Etter at han hadde stått opp frå dei døde, synte han seg for dei som hadde sett han, med eid på: I om lag førti dagar kom han til dei. Då han hadde vore der, synte han seg for dei saman med fem hundre andre at dei var falne. Å gjere det er å diskreditere heile rettsvitskapssystemet vårt. Og alle desse fekk sjå at Herren hadde stått opp frå dei døde, og dei åt med han. Men alle desse fekk sjå at det var eit vitnemål frå Herren. Dei som talar slik, seier: « Sanneleg, eg seier dykk: Ingen har gjort seg skuldig i noko som helst. For det han sa, var løgn. Dei ville ha tilstått heile hykleriet: "Han synte seg levande etter hans lidenskap ved mange ufeilbare bevis."<br/>Han synte seg for dei i førti dagar og tala om det som høyrer Guds rike til.<br/>Men no er det nokre som lurer på kva tid Guds rike skal koma. Dei har ikkje godt i sinne og trur dei kan gjera lenkjene hans tyngre å bera. Med lovnad og eid, to ting som ikkje kan endrast – og Guds rike kan ikkje bli ståande. For det skal ikkje vera ende på denne verda som er underlagd mørker og trelldom, men Guds rike, det som er gjort i rettferd og fred. Han skal vera konge der sola går ned, og kongedømet hans skal vera alt frå strand til strand. » Den dagen skal vera ein dag med stor herlegdom og herlegdom, ein dag med sjukdom og lidingar og piner som skal koma over heile verda. Og det skal vera ein dag med uår og synd, ein dag med grisk og grådig lyst som skal koma over heile verda. Er ikkje dette sagt fullt og heilt med tanke på oss? Jau, for vår skuld er det skrive. For vår skuld er det skrive. For vår skuld er det skrive. Den første bøna vi ber er: Lat riket ditt koma. Lat viljen din råda på jorda slik som i himmelen. Så tala han til dei om det som hadde hendt i førti dagar.<br/>Ein gong han åt saman med dei, gav han dei dette påbodet: « De skal ikkje dra bort frå Jerusalem, men venta på det som Far har lova, det som de har høyrt av meg.<br/>Og han sa: « No må de venta og vera her heilt til de får det som Far har lova. Dette løftet som han referer til, er utan tvil det som er lova i Joel der Herren har lova: «Og det skal henda i dei siste dagar, seier Herren, at eg vil renna ut min Ande over alt kjøt, og sønene og døtterne dykkar skal profetera, og dei unge mennene dykkar skal drøyma draumar, og gamalmennene dykkar skal sjå syner, og på tenarane og tenestjentene mine vil eg renna min Ande.» For dette er Fars lovnad: Det skal koma, og den dagen skal koma, og Anden skal koma over alt i alle.<br/>For Johannes døypte med vatn, men de skal døypast med Den heilage ande om nokre få dagar. »<br/>For Johannes døypte med vatn, han som døypte med Den heilage ande. Med vatn døypte han folket med vatn, så dei vart døypte med Den heilage ande om nokre få dagar.<br/>Medan dei var samla, spurde dei han: « Herre, er tida komen då du vil reisa opp att riket for Israel? »<br/>« Når og når skal dette henda, Herre? » spurde han. Men no talar han til dei og seier: « Ikkje for riket, men for den makta dei skal få. »<br/>Han svara: « Det er ikkje gjeve dykk å kjenna tider og stunder som Far har fastsett av si eiga makt.<br/>Dei var berre uvituge og venta på han i all si naud. Dei gjekk bort til han som frelsar for verda, og til han sa dei: « Ver ikkje redde! » Han kledde maktene og åndskreftene nakne og viste dei fram til spott og spe då han synte seg som sigerherre over dei på jorda. Og når han talar om å fara opp til Jerusalem, blir han overgjeven til syndarar og krossfest. Han seier til dei: « Herre, Herre! Er du uvitande om dette riket, så lat det vera langt borte frå deg! » Då Jesus døydde på krossen, vart dei alle svært skuffa.<br/>Men då dei var på veg til Emmaus, vart dei sorgfulle. Dei sa til kvarandre: « Korleis kan de vera sorgfulle, de », sa dei. « Du veit ikkje kva de har gjort? » Jesus frå Nasaret, ein mann med stor makt og kraft – han var det som vart salva av Gud. Vi håpa på hans frelsar for Israel, han som dei krossfeste. Etter at han har stått opp frå dei døde, seier han: ‘ Om nokre dagar skal de få det som er lova, og då skal de få det som er lova. ’ Men er det tida då riket ditt skal byggjast opp, då skal de få kraft når Den heilage ande kjem over dykk. »<br/>No vert den greske preposisjonen epi brukt om eit nytt forhold dei skulle ha til Den heilage ande. I Johannesevangeliet kapittel 14, der Jesus har lova å sende Den heilage ande, sa han: «Eg skal ikkje gjera dykk sorgfulle. Eg vil koma til dykk og be Faderen, og han skal senda dykk ein annan trøystar, Sannhets Ande, som verda ikkje kan få, for ho ser han ikkje og kjenner han ikkje. Men de kjenner han, for han blir hos dykk og skal vera i dykk. Og dei sa: « Han er i dykk, og han skal bu i dykk. Han skal òg bli verande i dykk, og de skal få kraft når Den heilage ande kjem over dykk. » Den greske preposisjonen epi, som er omsett i ulike tekstar gjennom heile Det nye testamentet som «på» eller «over» eller eg likar det, «overfløymer».<br/>På den siste dagen i høgtida, den store dagen i høgtida, steig Jesus fram på tempelberget og ropa til folket: «Om nokon tørstar, skal han koma til meg og drikka; men om nokon drikk av det vatnet eg vil gje, skal han drikka av det.» Johannes sa: «Dette sa han som ikkje hadde fått Anden, den som dei som trur på han, ikkje skulle få. » Og Johannes svara: «Kva sa han då om Anden? Det skulle liknast med straum av levande vatn. Eg ønskjer at Anden må koma over dykk, enten det er over dykk, eller det er frå dykk, eller det er frå dykk, Så det trefoldige forholdet: Han er med deg før du omvender deg, han er den som får deg til å innse at du er ein syndar, han er den som peikar på Jesus Kristus som svaret når han overbeviser verda om synd, rettferd og dom. I det same du opnar ditt liv og hjarte for Jesus Kristus og kallar han til å koma inn, kjem Den Heilage Ande til å bu i deg. Han skal vera i deg. Veit de ikkje at de er dykkar eigne? De er kjøpte, og prisen er betalt. Difor skal de æra Gud med kroppen! For kroppen er eit tempel for Den heilage ande som bur i dykk, Drikk ikkje vin, som det finst overflod av, men ver fylte av Anden, som det finst overflod av. For dette er det tredje bodet: Bli fylte med Anden!<br/>Men de skal få kraft når Den heilage ande kjem over dykk, og de skal vera mine vitne. »<br/>Det er interessant å merke seg at det greske ordet for vitne er martus, som tyder martyr, og det greske ordet for martyr. Eit vitne er ein som ikkje berre forkynner det han trur, han lever det han trur, han er det han trur, og han trur så sterkt på det at han om nødvendig vil døy for det han trur. Så sterk er trua hans, han er ein martus. Han er ikkje redd for å døy for det han trur på.<br/>Og då Paulus var på veg tilbake til Jerusalem, kom Agabos ned frå Cæsarea. Han tok beltet til Paulus og batt beltet til seg og sa: « Når han kjem til Jerusalem, må han som eig dette beltet, gjera som han har bunde seg med. » Då gret dei og sa: « Paulus, du må ikkje gå herifrå! » Han svara: « Kva er dette for tale? Trur du at du kan gje meg over til dei? Eg er klar til å døy. » For eg er klar til å døy; eg har ikkje drepe deg fordi du trudde, men for at du skal leva som eit vitne, ein truande bror. » Så det var ikkje eit vitnemål mot deg, det var berre eit vitnemål mot deg. Hadde du ikkje vore ein martyr, hadde du ikkje gått til grunne. Du hadde sagt: « Whoa, whoa, vent. No trur eg at eg har gjort ein feil, og så seier du: Han er ikkje ein martus, og du stel ikkje ein hest. Han steig ikkje frå deg, han stel ikkje frå deg, du stel ikkje frå han, du stel ikkje frå han, du stel ikkje frå han, du stel ikkje frå han, du stel frå han! Den som stal, er ikkje ein hesttjuv. Han er då ikkje eit vitne mot meg, men mot deg som var han ein martyr. Og du er vitne mot dei alle.<br/>Og han heldt fram med å vitna i Jerusalem og i heile Judea-landet.<br/>Og då han var komen i hus, gjekk det endå lenger ut, til huset hans Jerusalem og bygde vidare utover Judea og Jerusalem. Huset hans låg vegg i vegg med vegen så han kunne reisa til Samaria. Etter det som har hendt i dei siste dagane, kjem vi til å sjå korleis det går med vitnemålet om at vi har vore i Jerusalem. Det vil vi gjerne tala om i dei neste dagane. » Då han hadde fått dette påbodet, drog han ned til Samaria. Der ønskte han at Paulus og Barnabas skulle forkynna evangeliet der i landet. Ved Anden vart han salva og krafta i Den heilage ande.<br/>Då han hadde sagt dette, vart han lyft opp medan dei såg på, og ei sky tok han bort for auga deira.<br/>Dette er det siste løftet Jesus gav læresveinane sine. Dette er dei siste orda før han steig opp til himmelen. Sjølvsagt kom han seinare og tala til Paulus og andre, men før han steig opp, er dette det siste ordet hans. Då han hadde sagt dette, vart han lyft opp medan dei såg på, og ei sky tok han bort for auga deira.<br/>Som dei stod og stirte opp mot himmelen då han fór bort, stod det med eitt to menn i kvite klede framfor dei<br/>Me reknar med at dei var englar.<br/>og sa: « Galilearar, kvifor står de og ser opp mot himmelen? Denne Jesus, som vart teken bort frå dykk opp til himmelen, han skal koma att på same måten som de såg han fara opp til himmelen. »<br/>Og dei skal sjå han att: Herren kjem med sine heilage i tusental, og han skal halda dom over dei på jorda. Og han som elska oss og gav seg sjølv for oss og gjorde oss til tenarar for vår Gud, til kongar og prestar, som skal regjera saman med han på jorda. Sjå, Herren kjem, og kvart auge skal sjå han, og dei som har gjennemstunge han, skal sørgja. Sjå, no legg Herren si hand på han: Han skal koma! Ja, alle skal sjå han, men dei som ikkje ser han, skal skjøna at han er komen med ein augneblink. Det er berre læresveinane som har sett han, men dei som har sett han. Jesus svara: «Om dei seier til dykk: ‘Han er komen i løynd’, så tru det ikkje om dei seier: ‘Han er komen i løynd’ eller ‘Han er komen i løynd’, så tru det ikkje om dei seier: ‘Han er komen i løynd’ eller ‘Han er i løynd’, så tru det ikkje.<br/>og sa: « Denne Jesus, som vart teken bort frå dykk opp til himmelen, skal koma att på same måten som de såg han fara opp til himmelen. »<br/>No er det eit svært interessant vers i II Joh, vers 1:7 , «For mange forførarar er komne inn i verda, som ikkje vedkjenner at Jesus Kristus er komen i kjøtet.» Det er dessverre ei dårleg omsetjing av det greske. For her står det skrive: Dei som ikkje vil tru at Jesus Kristus er komen i kjøt og blod, han skal òg dømma dei som ikkje vil tru at han er komen i kjøt og blod. Dette er forføreren, Antikrist! Vakta dykk, så de ikkje mistar det de har arbeidd for, men får den fulle løna. Den som ikkje blir verande i Kristi lære, blir verande i Gud og Gud i han. Den som blir verande i Kristi lære, har fellesskap både med Sonen og med Faderen. Og kjem det nokon til dykk og ikkje har denne læra, då skal de ikkje ta han inn i huset og ikkje ønskja han velkomen! For den som ønskjer han velkomen, blir medskuldig i alt det vonde han gjer." (2 Joh 1,7-11) Spør dei: "Kommer Jesus i kjøt og blod?" Spør dei berre om det, og svarar dei ikkje jamvel det dei har sagt, så kom i hug det som Johannes formana dykk med, og det som Johannes fortalde dykk. Er det nokon som ikkje vil bekjenne at Jesus Kristus er komen i kjøt og blod? Då sa Jesus til læresveinane: « Gjev meg mat! » Han sa til dei: « De veit at åndene ikkje et. Rør meg! Det er eg. » og sidan dei såg han fara opp til himmelen, har eg den trua at han kjem snart. »<br/>Då vende dei tilbake til Jerusalem frå den høgda som heiter Oljeberget og ligg nær Jerusalem, berre ei sabbatsreise unna. Inne i byen gjekk dei opp på den salen der dei brukte å halda til. Det var Peter og Johannes, Jakob og Andreas, Filip og Tomas, Bartolomeus og Matteus, Jakob, son til Alfeus, Simon seloten og Judas, son til Jakob. Alle desse heldt trufast saman i bøn, i lag med nokre kvinner og Maria, mor til Jesus, og brørne hans.<br/>Dette er den siste omtalen av Maria, mor til Jesus. På dette tidspunktet og frå dette punktet er det ingen omtale av henne i Apostelgjerningane eller i breva. Ingen omtale av hennes død eller hennes mirakuløse oppstiging til himmelen utan død. Det finst ikkje noko anna i Skrifta enn dette: Det er stilt.<br/>Brørne hans skulle truleg vera ei nemning på Jakob og Judas og dei andre brørne som var søner av Josef og Maria.<br/>Det er dei som held nattverd med læresveinane, og det er dei som held nattverd med læresveinane sine. For det er dei som held nattverd med læresveinane, og med dei er det ein flokk som går inn på tempelplassen. Ta ditt val.<br/>I dei dagane steig Peter fram mellom syskena. Det var samla om lag hundre og tjue menneske. Og han sa: « Brør! Det skriftordet som Den heilage ande lét David seia om Judas, han som vart vegvisar for dei som greip Jesus, må no fullførast. »<br/>Peter gjorde seg òg gjeldande og stod fram. Så bad dei saman og sa: « Brør, det er noko som må oppfyllast. » Og de veit at han seier til dei: « Lat oss kasta lodd om kven som skal ta plassen etter Judas. » For eg skjønar at Peter gjorde det på nytt og gav seg til å dansa. For det ligg ikkje noko anna i det som denne forsamlinga har skrive om han. Eg vil gjerne vita om det, endå eg kjenner han; det kan vera til oppmuntring for meg i Skrifta, Peter syner ei svært stor forståing av Det gamle testamentet, noko som er eit poeng i hans favør.<br/>Legg merke til at Peter tilskriv Den heilage ande det som David har skrive: «Hele Skrifta er innanda av Gud» (2 Tim 3,16). Det er ikkje ein del av skriftene. For dersom du fortel meg at delar av skriftene er gjevne ved inspirasjon frå Gud, så må eg spørje deg, "Hvilke delar er ved inspirasjon og kva delar er ikkje ved inspirasjon?" Så sant du held meg for ein du har fellesskap med, så sant du held deg til ein du har fellesskap med, og ikkje med ein du har fellesskap med. Det er her eg tener Gud. Ta dykk i vare for dei som seier: ‘ Dei har ikkje godt i sinne og trur alt dei seier. ’! Når det gjeld David, så vitnar han i brevet til Peter: « David har tala ved Den heilage ande. Han har profettalen òg tala ved Davids munn og forkynt ved Den heilage ande for Judas.<br/>Han var rekna mellom oss og hadde del i same teneste og oppdrag. Han kjøpte oss fri for urett, og då vart han støytt ned,<br/>Han kjøpte åkeren, pottemakerens åker, slik Sakarja seier i det ellevte kapitlet.<br/>Så fall han med hovudet mot jorda og braut segl på jorda, og alle innvolane hans braut ut.<br/>Men nokre jødar frå Asia såg at det ikkje var noko å seia på han. Og då dei kom med skuldingane sine, sa dei: « Vi treng ikkje betala. » Med det same gjekk dei inn i tempelet og la det ved føtene til Judas. Då kasta han pengane inn i tempelet og forlét staden. Og han gjekk bort og hengde seg. Veldig enkelt, han gjekk opp i treet for å hengja seg, bandt tauet rundt halsen og bandt det til lemmet og hoppa. Og styrken av fallet knakk anten tauet eller hovudet hans, og han fall ned i kløfta og akkurat som han sa det her.<br/>Alle som bur i Jerusalem, fekk vita dette, og på sitt eige mål kallar dei difor åkeren Hakeldama – det tyder Blodåkeren. For det står skrive i Salmane: Lat bustaden hans liggja i øyde, lat ingen bu der, og: Lat ein annan overta hans oppdrag!<br/>No siterer han i røynda frå to ulike salmar her. Frå salme 69:25 , set han det saman med salme 109:8 . Og set han dei to saman finn han desse profetiane om Judas.<br/>Kva skal vi då seia om desse menneska?<br/>til å ta plassen etter Judas og overta den aposteltenesta som dei gjekk ifrå då dei kalla Judas.<br/>21 Difor er det nokre menn som hev fylgst med oss heile tidi medan Herren Jesus gjekk inn og ut hjå oss.<br/>De veit at mange var læresveinane hans òg, og at mange av dei var dei ti. Difor vart han rekna som apostel for dei tolv, fordi han hadde sagt at dei òg var utsendingar. Då sa han til dei: « Vi har ikkje meir enn elleve vaktskift, så lat oss finna han her. For her er vi i lag med Jesus frå først av. »<br/>heilt frå byrjinga, då han vart døypt av Johannes, og til den dagen han vart teken frå oss opp til himmelen. No må ein av desse saman med oss vera vitne om at han er stått opp. »<br/>Dei lengta etter å få sjå han att – det hadde dei heilt frå Johannes vart døypte og til døden. Og dei såg Herren som stod opp frå dei døde, og dei gav han lov til å sjå.<br/>No vart det sagt til meg: « Har eg ikkje sett Kristus? » « Ja », svara apostelen. « I dag er det ein apostel », endå eg ikkje veit det. Eg meiner at det ikkje finst nokon vitnemål mot dei om oppstoda frå dei døde slik som dei var i den nye pakta,<br/>To menn vart kalla fram: Josef, som vart kalla Barsabbas med tilnamnet Justus, og Mattias. Dei bad: « Herre, du som kjenner alle hjarte, vis oss kven av desse to du har valt ut<br/>Eg meiner at det er rett i Herrens auge å kjenna to ting: Det er rett i Guds auge at vi går fram på denne måten, det er sagt til Paulus. Peter var irritert, og hoppa på pistolen og sa, "Hei, vi må gjere noko, du veit, vi må hjelpe Gud ut. Du veit, ein manglar, og vi må fylle han ut." Og likevel, "Gud, kva av desse to vil du?" Og gje Gud dei to vala.<br/>til å ta plassen etter Judas og overta den aposteltenesta som han gjekk ifrå då han fór til sin eigen stad. » Dei kasta lodd,<br/>For det er godt om nokon finn seg i ufortent liding fordi samvitet er bunde til Gud. No i gamal tid hadde dei ein interessant måte å gå til presten på, som ville spørje Herren for dei gjennom urim og tummim, "lysa og fullkomne." Nøyaktig kva desse urim og tummim var, veit vi ikkje. Eg er sikker på at det ikkje var dei farga brillene som Joseph Smith fann med dei gylne tavlene; dei magiske brillene, at når ein tok dei på, kunne ein plutseleg lese hieroglyfskrifta.<br/>Det finst dei som seier at urim og tummim eigentleg var ein svart og ein kvit stein som vart båret i ein pose på brystet til presten, dei ville be og spørje Herren eit bestemt spørsmål. Du veit at David spurde Herren: «Herre, skal vi dra ut mot filistarane?» Han svara: «Nei.» Dagen etter spurde David: «Herre, skal vi dra ut mot filistarane?» Han svara: «Ja.» «Når skal vi dra ut?» Dei ville stille konkrete spørsmål, og Herren ville rettleia dei gjennom urim og tommelen. Dei sa at presten skulle be, søkja Gud, og så gå inn og ta ut ein av dei to steinane. Om det var den kvite steinen, så var det eit ja. Viss det var eit nei, så ville det vera den svarte steinen som han ville dra ut. Nokre seier til og med at me får termen svartballa frå dette Urim og Thummim. Faktisk, tilbake i originalen er det ei nei-stemming mot eit bestemt prosjekt eller ide. Kva slags urim og tummim det var, veit vi ikkje, men i GT-tida brukte folk loddkastarar for å få vita kva som var Guds vilje.<br/>Så tok dei han med seg og kasta lodd, og dei spurde kven av dei Gud hadde valt ut: Judas Iskariot, han som vart kalla Den heilage ande.<br/>og at loddet fall på Mattias. Sidan vart han rekna som ein av dei elleve.<br/>Kven er så denne Mattias? Kven har aldri høyrt om han? Og ikkje eingong sidan? Han er sannsynlegvis apostel! Paulus forsvara seg og sa: « No har vi ikkje noko anna å seia om denne slekta, så vi kan skjøna kva som er Guds vilje: at ho skal venda om til Gud ved loddingar, anten det er av menneske eller av noko slag. »<br/>Eg kjenner ein som i dag, i eit forsøk på å skjelne Herrens vilje, vil be og stille Herren eit spørsmål. Han vil ha ti pennies i lomma, og medan han ber, vil han ta pennies med lukka auge og legg dei ned på bordet, og om dei alle kjem opp på hovudet, er det eit ja. Når Den heilage ande kjem, har vi ingen ting å visa til om nokon krev oss til rekneskap for dette livet. Det er sagt: ‘ Vi har ikkje noko anna å seia enn dette. ’ 2 Då so den Heilage Ande kom yver kyrkjelyden, tok han til å tala til dei og tala, og den Heilage Ande sa: Skil dykk ut åt med å tena meg, Paulus og Barnabas, so de kann få den tenesta som eg hev kalla dei til! No vart dei drivne av Den heilage ande og kom i ekstase.

Yes that is correct, the Urbanears don't have a built in noise cancelling mic on the headphone itself but from what I can see there is a mic on the cable provided.<br/>1. Well the mic is usually placed where it can have a connection to the PCB which are within the headphones so if you mean that the mic shouldn't be on the headphone itself, that (from my experience) is incorrect.<br/>2.

In fact, dynamic drivers work exactly the same as dynamic microphones but in reverse. Inside a dynamic driver there is a magnet, and when you plug in the headphones, you are sending a AC current through it which will turn the voice coil into a magnet. Depending on the direction of the current, the polarity of the magnet will change. Now since we know for a magnet, same charges repels and different charges attract, we know that the voice coil will move back and forth depending on it's polarity at the time. The voice coil is attached to the diaphragm which will then move back and forth creating a sound wave. The same occurs in reverse, if you move a coil through a magnet you produce a current instead. Since your voice is pushing the diaphragm, it is moving the voice coil back and forth generating the current you have observed.<br/><br/>100+ Head-Fier<br/><br/>Joined:<br/>Nov 7, 2011<br/><br/>Posts:<br/>134<br/><br/>Likes: 55<br/><br/>Exactly.

Avhengig av retninga på straumen, vil polariteten til magneten endra seg. No når me veit om ein magnet, same ladning fråstøter og ulike ladningar trekkjer til seg, veit me at talespolen vil bevege seg fram og tilbake avhengig av polariteten på den tida. Lydspolen er festa til membranen, som så flyttar seg fram og tilbake og dannar ei lydbølgje. Det same skjer baklengs. Dersom du flyttar ein spole gjennom ein magnet, får du i staden ein straum.

Stalin's opposition within the party, including Bukharin, Yagoda and Rykov were purged in these show trials, as Stalin manipulatively forced them to confess to crimes of planning a coup and opposing the state, even if there was no proof. Gabor T Rittersporn said, "Many of the victims were sincerely devoted to the principles of Bolshevism." This amplifies proof that the Bolshevik ideals that had once been the roots of the Communist Party were being disarranged and destroyed by the Purges. The party was depleted and former members helplessly watched Stalin use the great purge as a tool to transform Russia from a one party state to an unchallenged dictatorship. Again, the purges were shattering the framework of the Communist Party, formed during the Bolshevik revolution. This agrees with the "Stalin the executioner" source as both show the manipulative character, that helped the dictator to enhance his grip on Russia's throat.<br/>The manipulative manner, with which Stalin incriminated his targeted opposition during the purges, in the eyes of everyday Russians, also had an implosive impact on Soviet Society. Stalin was able to collect support from the people through his use of propaganda and the media to help him develop a "cult of personality" and the image of a heroic and brave leader. Through this support Stalin implanted mistrust into the minds of the people, convincing them that traitors of the revolution and what he described as 'enemies of the people', were amongst them.

Opposisjonen til Stalin innanfor partiet, inkludert Bukharin, Jegoda og Rykov, vart utrenska i desse førestillingsrettssakene, då Stalin manipulativt tvinga dei til å tilstå brotsverka å planleggje eit kupp og motsette seg staten, sjølv om det ikkje fanst noko bevis. Gabor T. Rittersporn sa: «Mange av offera var oppriktig vigde til bolsjevismens prinsipp.» Dette forsterkar beviset for at dei bolsjevikiske ideala som ein gong hadde vore røtene til kommunistpartiet, vart forstyrra og øydelagde av utreinskingane. Partiet vart utarma og tidlegare medlemmar såg hjelpelaust på Stalin nytta den store utrenskinga som eit verkemiddel for å omforme Russland frå ein einpartistat til eit uangripeleg diktatur. Igjen var utreinskingane i ferd med å knuse ramma til kommunistpartiet, som vart danna under den bolsjevikiske revolusjonen.

| Supercell is nerfing brawlers instead of nerfing star powers. I was at 750 last season with power 8 nita and it is very tough to go past that, like, star powers play a really dominant role. The matchmaking is also trash. When i play gem grab(around 600 trophies), there are often matchups where the enemy team has one more player than us who is maxed and it's not even that we have a lvl 9 to compete versus that. Sometimes there are even matchups where the enemy team is fully maxed and none of us are. this is why i dont play brawl stars seriously anymore. It's not even like there arent many players who are not maxed and around 600 trophies. It's annoying.<br/>Edit: I think supercell should have at least a basic mechanism that takes the average of levels of brawlers when setting up matches.<br/><br/>Except trophies don't really indicate your skill. They indicate the skill of the teammates you are placed with. And I'm fine with playing against higher level brawlers, but when one team is all level 10 and the other team isn't, clearly it's unbalanced.<br/><br/>I reccomend getting some good friends to play with, me and 2 friends got my friends power 1 tick to rank 28 by playing gem grab with a certain composition all day and we made it without a single one of us being maxed with our brawlers.<br/><br/>I Know how you feel I used to have brawlers in high trophies with low level and it's to difficult to go more further and everything I was saying to myself "I want to have star powers" really supercell needs to make balance to the star powers or at least make a better matchmaking system.<br/><br/>I kinda feel this. I ain't as good at the game as you, but I got Emz to 500 at power 1 and the matchmaking was horrible. Maxed out players everywhere! And it didn't help that the majority of my teammates had around 5-8k trophies... I had to resort to solo showdown last minute because I can either ambush unsuspecting players or simply play a little aggressive at the right times. But I really wish that it could be a bit easier for people who want to push brawlers to really high trophy ranges without having the luxury of star powers.<br/><br/>Altho spike is still good without curveball. Curveball was just a help for hitting your shots more often as spike. But even before curveball was released, spike was a really strong brawler, so he will remain the same now.<br/><br/>I agree that they should have nerfed ambush, but I think they are trying to balance both Snappy Sniping and Ambush, as they are both getting merged with this change. She was becoming a little powerful, but still not nerf-worthy<br/><br/>I'm not sure about this, but now that Darryl got a noticeable buff, looking at their new stats, it looks like Darryl might overshadow Bull, as not only he can always deal more damage than Bull, he won't die as early anymore, so their survivability will be similar without star power (although Bull's survivability is still noticeably better than Darryl's if he had Tough Guy). Not only that, Darryl's super can auto regenerate, meaning Darryl MIGHT be able to be played effectively both as a heavyweight AND an assassin at the same time (before he sucks as a heavyweight but decent as an assassin)<br/><br/>But hes overrated af. And you get trophies with him really easily. So im kinda ok with the nerf. I havent even played him since when I got him to 500 (around 5 months ago), so not that I care that much either.<br/><br/>Why doesn't Poco/Penny get a HP nerf, if they are Marksman/Healer respectively not a tank?<br/>Why isn't Rosa's tankyness nerfed, cough 70% damage reduction?<br/>Why is Tick allowed to have the highest range and the most free pokedamage in the entire game?<br/>Why doesn't Leon get a HP/Damage buff?<br/><br/>Be that as it may, it was Ambush that was OP, not base Piper. I would argue that Ambush is the best star power in the game (now even more so since the percentage of damage increase indirectly went up) and base Piper was a bottom-10 brawler.<br/><br/>What Supercell should do is revert both nerfs, reduce Ambush to 600, and reduce Snappy Sniping to 0.25 since it'd be indirectly buffed by the base damage buff.<br/><br/>Yea and I believe they went a bit too far with Rosa, because now she is basically the better bull now when it comes to tanking, which she has been for a while. Now, Darryl might as well be a smaller, more powerful bull<br/><br/>Why? I feel she needs a buff in almost everything except her star power. Her health and speed make her super a bit more difficult to use, because she can die pretty easily, and it is really difficult for her to trap faster brawlers like Crow. Her star power is a bit broken though... | Supercell er i gang med å nerfisera brawlarar i staden for å nerfisera stjernekrefter. Eg var på 750 sist sesong med power 8 nita og det er veldig tøft å gå forbi at, liksom, stjernekrefter spelar ei verkeleg dominerande rolle. Matchmaking er òg søppel. Når eg spelar gem grab(rundt 600 trofeer), er det ofte matchups der fiendtleg lag har ein meir spelar enn oss som er maxa og det er ikkje ein gong at me har ein lvl 9 til å konkurrere mot det. Nokre gonger er det til og med kampar der motstandarlaget er fullt maksimert og ingen av oss er det. Dette er grunnen til at eg ikkje spelar brawl stars seriøst lenger. Det er ikkje ein gong slik at det er mange spelarar som ikkje er maksimerte og rundt 600 troféar. Det er irriterende.<br/>Edit: Eg trur supercell bør ha i det minste ein grunnleggjande mekanisme som tek gjennomsnittet av nivåa til brawlers når ein set opp kampar.<br/><br/>Bortsett frå at pokalar ikkje verkeleg indikerer ferdigheitene dine. Dei indikerer ferdigheitene til lagkameratane du er plassert med. Og eg har det bra med å spela mot brawlarar på høgare nivå, men når eitt lag er heilt nivå 10 og det andre laget ikkje er det, er det tydeleg ubalansert.<br/><br/>Eg reknar med å få nokre gode vener å spele med, eg og 2 vener fekk venene mine power 1 tick to rank 28 ved å spele gem grab med ein viss komposisjon heile dagen og me klarte det utan at ein einaste av oss vart maxa med brawlers.<br/><br/>Eg veit korleis du føler at eg brukte å ha brawlers i høge trofeer med lågt nivå og det er for vanskeleg å gå lenger og alt eg sa til meg sjølv "Eg vil ha stjernekrefter" verkeleg supercell treng å balansere mot stjernekreftene eller i det minste lage eit betre matchmaking system.<br/><br/>Eg føler det på ein måte. Eg er ikkje så god på spelet som du er, men eg fekk Emz til 500 på power 1 og matchmaking var forferdelig. Maxed ut spelarar overalt! Og det hjalp ikkje at dei fleste av lagkameratane mine hadde rundt 5-8k trofeer ... Eg måtte ty til solooppgjør i siste minutt fordi eg anten kan overfalle intetanande spelarar eller berre spele litt aggressivt til rett tid. Men eg ynskjer verkeleg at det kunne vore litt lettare for folk som ynskjer å presse brawlarar til verkeleg høge troférekkjevidder utan å ha luksusen av stjernekrefter.<br/><br/>Altho spike er framleis bra utan kurveball. Kurveball var berre ein hjelp til å slå slag oftare som spike. Men sjølv før kurveballen vart sleppt ut, var spike ein verkeleg sterk bråkmakar, så han vil vera den same no.<br/><br/>Eg er einig i at dei skulle ha lagt seg i bakhald, men eg trur dei prøver å balansere både Snappy Sniping og Ambush, sidan dei begge vert slått saman med denne endringa. Ho var i ferd med å bli litt kraftig, men framleis ikkje nerf-verdig<br/><br/>Eg er ikkje sikker på dette, men no som Darryl fekk ein merkbar buff, ser det ut til at Darryl kan overskygge Bull, sidan han ikkje berre alltid kan handtere meir skade enn Bull, han vil ikkje døy så tidleg lenger, så overlevingsevnen deira vil vere lik utan stjernekraft (sjølv om Bull sin overlevingsevne framleis er merkbart betre enn Darryl sin om han hadde Tough Guys). Ikkje berre det, superen til Darryl kan automatisk regenerere, noko som betyr at Darryl KAN bli spela effektivt både som tungvektar OG snikmordar på same tid (før han suger som tungvektar, men grei som snikmordar)<br/><br/>Men han er overvurdert af. Og du får trofeer med han veldig lett. Så im kinda ok med nerven. Eg har ikkje spelt han sidan eg fekk han til 500 (rundt 5 månader sidan), så ikkje at eg bryr meg så mykje heller.<br/><br/>Kvifor får ikkje Poco/Penny ein HP-nerv, om dei er Marksman/Healer høvesvis ikkje ein tank?<br/>Kvifor er ikkje Rosa sin tankyness nerdete, hosta 70% skadereduksjon?<br/>Kvifor har Tick lov til å ha det høgaste rangen og den mest frie pokedamasjen i heile spelet?<br/>Kvifor får ikkje Leon ein HP/Damage-buff?<br/><br/>Uansett var det Ambush som var OP, ikkje base Piper. Eg vil hevde at Ambush er den beste stjernekrafta i spelet (no endå meir sidan prosentdelen av skadeauken indirekte gjekk opp) og base Piper var ein bottom-10 brawler.<br/><br/>Det Supercell skal gjere er å snu begge nervene, redusera Ambush til 600, og redusera Snappy Sniping til 0,25 sidan det ville bli indirekte blåst av baseskadebuffen.<br/><br/>Ja, og eg trur dei gjekk litt for langt med Rosa, for no er ho i utgangspunktet den betre oksen no når det gjeld tanking, som ho har vore ei stund.<br/><br/>Kvifor? Eg føler at ho treng ein buff i nesten alt anna enn stjernekrafta si. Helsen og farten hennar gjer superen litt vanskelegare å bruke, fordi ho kan døy ganske lett, og det er verkeleg vanskeleg for henne å fange raskare bråkmakarar som Crow. Stjernekrafta hennar er litt øydelagd sjølv om... |

Gjennom det heile er Caillou framleis ein uimotståeleg liten gut i ei svært stor verd, som alle små barn og foreldre kan identifisere seg med. |
| Self-Employment Part 1<br/><br/>When you accept an employment in any organisation, you have to perform various jobs as per the requirements of your employer and you may get a fixed amount of income as salary. You may run a small retail shop, tailoring shop, restaurant, bakery and confectionery, beauty salon, etc. in your locality. You may get engaged in trading or manufacturing on a small scale or providing some service for a price. Such economic activities are known as self-employment.<br/><br/>Meaning of Self-Employment<br/><br/>Earning is necessary for a living. Our father, mother, brothers, sisters and others may be engaged in different economic activities through which they earn their livelihood. These persons are engaged in an economic activity which is termed as wage employment or paid employment. But there are many persons who engage themselves in an occupation or some business which they start and manage on their own. They put in their best effort and take all types of risks to pursue their careers successfully. The entire earning of their work goes to them. All of us have seen small grocery shops, tailoring shops, medical stores etc. in our locality. These are owned and managed by a person, with or without the help of some assistants. Their economic activities are termed as self-employment. So, when an individual engages in any economic activity and manages it on his own, it is known as self-employment.<br/><br/>Objectives<br/><br/>After studying this lesson, you will be able to:<br/><br/>Image of Objectives<br/><br/>Image of Objectives<br/><br/>Characteristics of Self-Employment<br/><br/>It involves ownership and management of activities by a person although he/she may take the help of one or two persons to assist him/her. Thus, self-employment may provide employment to other persons as well.<br/><br/>The earning from self-employment is not fixed. It depends on the income one can earn by producing or buying and selling goods or providing services to others at a price.<br/><br/>In self-employment, the owner alone has to take the profit and bear the risk of loss. So, we find a direct link between the effort and reward in self-employment.<br/><br/>It requires some amount of capital investment, although it may be small.<br/><br/>In self-employment, a person is free to take decisions in respect of running his business profitably and avail of any opportunity that may come up for expansion of his business. It gives complete freedom to work as per one's own will and within the parameters of the prevailing laws.<br/><br/>Thus, self-employment may be defined as, an economic activity which one may perform on his own as a gainful occupation, and this may consist of producing and selling goods, buying and selling goods, or rendering services for a price. | Sjølvstendig næringsdrivande del 1<br/><br/>Når du tek imot arbeidsløyse i ein organisasjon, må du utføre ulike arbeidsoppgåver i samsvar med krava til arbeidsgivaren din, og du kan få eit fast inntektsbeløp som lønn. Du kan drive ein liten butikk, skredderbutikk, restaurant, bakeri og konditori, skjønnhetssalong, osb. i nærområdet ditt. Du kan drive handel eller produksjon i liten skala eller tilby tenester til ein pris. Slik økonomisk aktivitet er kjend som sjølvstendig næringsdrivande.<br/><br/>Betydningen av sjølvstendig næringsdrivande<br/><br/>For det er nødvendig at både far og mor, brør og systrer, også dei som har overflod av det, lever av det som blir gjeve dei, og ikkje av det som blir gjeve dei, at dei må døy. Desse personane driv ei økonomisk verksemd som blir kalla lønnsarbeid eller lønna arbeid, men det er mange personar som driv eit yrke eller ei verksemd som dei startar og driv på eiga hand. Dei gjer sitt beste for å ta alle typar risikoar for å gjere karriere. All inntekta frå arbeidet går til dei. Alle av oss har sett små dagligvarebutikkar, skredderbutikkar, medisinbutikkar osv. i nærområdet vårt. Desse er eigd og styrt av ein person, med eller utan hjelp av nokre assistentar. Dei økonomiske aktivitetane deira blir kalla sjølvstendig næringsverksemd. Når ein person driv ei økonomisk verksemd og styrer den på eiga hand, blir det derfor kalla sjølvstendig næringsverksemd.<br/><br/>Måla<br/><br/>Etter å ha studert denne leksjonen vil du kunne:<br/><br/>Bilete av mål<br/><br/>Bilete av mål<br/><br/>Kjenneteikn ved sjølvstendig næringsdrivande<br/><br/>Det inneber eigarskap og styring av verksemda til ein person, sjølv om han/ho kan ta hjelp av ein eller to personar for å hjelpe han/henne.<br/><br/>Inntekta frå sjølvstendig næringsdrivande er ikkje fastsett, men er avhengig av den inntekta ein kan få ved å produsere eller kjøpe og selje varer eller tilby tenester til andre til ein pris.<br/><br/>I sjølvstendig næringsdrivande må eigaren sjølv ta fortjenesten og bere risikoen for tap, så me finn ein direkte samanheng mellom innsatsen og løna i sjølvstendig næringsdrivande.<br/><br/>Det krev ei viss mengd kapitalinvesteringar, sjølv om det kan vere lite.<br/><br/>I sjølvstendig næringsdrivande er ein person fri til å ta avgjerder om å drive verksemda si lønsamt og nytte seg av alle høve som kan kome opp for utviding av verksemda si. Det gjev full fridom til å arbeide etter eige ønske og innanfor rammene av dei gjeldande lovene.<br/><br/>Sjølvstendig næringsdrivande kan difor definerast som ei økonomisk verksemd som ein kan utføre på eiga hand som lønnsarbeid, og dette kan bestå i å produsere og selje varer, kjøpe og selje varer eller yte tenester mot ein pris. |
