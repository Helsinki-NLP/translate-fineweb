In simple terms, the condition is characterized by: one develops a kidney disease and undergoes a kidney transplant and other diseases associated with acidic concentration in the blood and gout. In theory, the condition will occur even if the genetic change is inherited from one parent and sporadically occurs when there is no family history.<br/><br/>Common names of autosomal dominant interstitial kidney disease<br/><br/>The condition has other names as well namely: medullary cystic kidney disease, although this name is not used as much because most people suffering from this condition do not have medullary cysts. It is also referred to as juvenile hyperuricemic nephropathy. The disease tends to affect people of ages 20 to 50. The latter condition as aforementioned occurs in young children, something, which translate to get it from both parents.<br/>Cystic kidney disease is an inherited condition whereby the cysts in the centre of each kidney gradually lose their ability to function properly. Cysts refer to abnormal blisters of fluid in the kidney. The condition further scares the kidney making unable to concentrate the urine and as a result, producing too much urine. Its symptoms include excessive urination, salt cravings, weakness, confusion, bleeding, fatigue, frequent hiccups, low blood pressure, nausea and vomiting, headaches, pale skin, reduced sensation in the hands, weight loss among many others. Other complications include: anemia, ulcers, loss of bone density, infertility and other heart related problems.<br/>Its analysis incorporates blood tests to check for sodium levels and general kidney functions, urine tests to check the levels of concentration and other imbalances, x rays to check for the size of kidneys that may be altered owing to increased urine concentrations, renal biopsy and genetic testing to verify any genetic changes that might have taken place in due time.<br/>While the disease does not have a cut and dry treatment to it, one may focus on controlling measures, which include intake of fluids and salt to supplement the one lost as the disease progresses into latter stages. This also helps reduce dehydration. Other treatments include taking of prescribed medication and diet changes and minimal intakes of foods containing phosphorous and potassium. Further complications may also require one to have a kidney transplant. Basically, this is not a curable disease but rather a manageable once detected in the early stages.<br/><br/>The common yet different factor of Autosomal dominant interstitial kidney disease<br/><br/>Nephronophthisis and medullary cystic kidney disease are mainly grouped together because, in essence, they share the same features but with a slight difference in regards inheritance patterns to the former affecting children and the latter affecting young adults and older age groups. Similar features for both are ADH resistant urine concentration that leads to polyuria and polydipsia, anemia and renal diseases.<br/>The former aforementioned condition is Autosomal recessive accounting to 15% of chronic diseases and causes ESRD during early childhood while the latter is Autosomal dominant with a few sporadic new mutations and causes ESRD for people between the ages of 30 and 50. | Nettbasert HLR-sertifiseringsblogg<br/><br/>Dato: 23. juli 2014<br/><br/>Autosomal dominant interstitiell nyresjukdom er ei sjeldan samling av sjukdommar som påverkar dei kjende funksjonane til nyrene. Enkelt sagt er tilstanden prega av: ein utviklar ein nyresjukdom og gjennomgår nyretransplantasjon og andre sjukdommar knytt til sur konsentrasjon i blodet og gikt. I teorien vil tilstanden oppstå sjølv om den genetiske endringa er arveleg frå ein forelder og sporadisk oppstår når det ikkje finst slektshistorie.<br/><br/>Vanlege namn på autosomal dominant interstitiell nyresjukdom<br/><br/>Tilstanden har òg andre namn, nemleg: medullær cystisk nyresjukdom, sjølv om dette namnet ikkje blir brukt så mykje fordi dei fleste som lid av denne tilstanden ikkje har medullære cystar. Det er også referert til som juvenil hyperurikemisk nefropati. Sykdommen har ein tendens til å påverke folk i alderen 20 til 50 år. Sistnemnde tilstand som nemnt ovanfor oppstår hos små barn, noko som omset til å få det frå begge foreldra.<br/>Cystisk nyresjukdom er ein arveleg tilstand der cystane i midten av kvar nyre gradvis mistar evna til å fungere som dei skal. Tilstanden skremmer vidare nyrene slik at dei ikkje er i stand til å konsentrere urinen og dermed produserer for mykje urin. Symptoma er kraftig urinering, saltsug, svakhet, forvirring, blødning, utmatting, hyppige hikke, lågt blodtrykk, kvalme og oppkast, hodepine, bleik hud, redusert kjensle i hendene, vekttap blant mange andre. Andre komplikasjonar er anemi, sår, tap av beintettleik, infertilitet og andre hjarterelaterte problem.<br/>Analysen omfattar blodprøvar for å sjå etter natriumnivå og generelle nyrefunksjonar, urinprøvar for å sjå etter konsentrasjonsnivå og andre ubalansar, røntgenstråler for å sjå etter storleiken på nyrene som kan bli endra på grunn av auka urinkonsentrasjonar, nyrebiopsi og genetisk testing for å verifisere eventuelle genetiske endringar som kan ha skjedd i rett tid.<br/>Sjølv om sjukdommen ikkje har ein kutte og tørr behandling til det, kan ein fokusere på å kontrollere tiltak, som inkluderer inntak av væske og salt for å utfylle den eine tapte som sykdommen går inn i seinare stadier. Dette bidrar også til å redusere dehydrering. Andre behandlingar er å ta foreskrevne medisinar og diettendringar og minimalt inntak av matvarer som inneheld fosfor og kalium. Ytterligere komplikasjonar kan også krevje at ein må ha ein nyretransplantasjon. I utgangspunktet er dette ikkje ein herdbar sjukdom, men heller ein overskueleg sjukdom som ein gong vart oppdaga i dei tidlege stadiuma.<br/><br/>Den vanlege, men ulike faktoren ved autosomal dominant interstitiell nyresjukdom<br/><br/>Nephronophthisis og medullær cystisk nyresjukdom er hovudsakleg gruppert saman fordi dei i hovudsak deler dei same eigenskapane, men med ein liten skilnad i arvemønster til dei førstnemnde som påverkar borna og dei sistnemnde som påverkar unge vaksne og eldre aldersgrupper. Liknande trekk for begge er ADH-resistent urinkonsentrasjon som fører til polyuri og polydipsi, anemi og nyresjukdommar.<br/>Den tidlegare nemnde tilstanden er autosomal recessiv som står for 15 % av kroniske sjukdommar og fører til ESRD i tidleg barndom, medan den sistnemnde er autosomal dominant med nokre få sporadiske nye mutasjonar og fører til ESRD for folk mellom 30 og 50 år. |
| Hobbes' vs. Locke's Account on the State of Nature<br/><br/>Topic: PhilosophyWords: 2539Pages: 9Aug 3rd, 2021<br/><br/>Hobbes and Locke are among the most influential political philosophers to ever write in English. The state of nature, which precedes the organization of the complex societies, is the common premise that both Hobbes and Locke share but interpret in different ways. The former views humans in their natural state as equally dangerous and free to pursue their egoistic goals unrestricted by the nonexistent notions of justice, which is why his natural state amounts to the "war of every man against every man" (Hobbes76). The latter, on the other hand, views humans in their original condition as equally valuable and restricts natural freedom by the idea of justice that requires not to harm others, which allows defining the state of nature as "mutual assistance and preservation" rather than war (Locke 15). The key difference between the two philosophers' accounts of natural state is that Locke uses ethical considerations while Hobbes does not, and it ultimately leads Hobbes to envisage a state exercising unlimited power over human beings, while Locke limits the government by the moral principles, which he considers a natural law.<br/><br/>Hobbes bases his assumptions regarding the state of nature on the fact that all people are roughly equal in their physical and mental capabilities. He admits that some individuals may demonstrate greater physical strength or superior intellect but insists that "when all is reckoned together, the difference between man and man is not so considerable" (Hobbes 74). Since humans are roughly equal in their capabilities, they also have similar hopes to attain their ends and satisfy their needs (Hobbes 75). As a logical outcome of this equality, when the people begin competing for scarce resources, no one may feel entirely secure in his or her possessions. Even if a mighty, cunning, and capable person succeeds in subjugating "the persons of all men he can," it still does not guarantee the ultimate security (Hobbes 75). As no human can obtain such superiority over the others that renders him or her utterly immune to their strength of intellect, no human can feel completely safe when surrounded by his or her equals. Hobbes' equality in the natural state is equality of fear, where all humans view each other as dangerous competitors.<br/><br/>Just as Hobbes, Locke considers all human beings to be fundamentally equal, but assigns a very different meaning to the term. From his perspective, it is not the equality of capabilities, but, rather, the equality of value. He opines that the people "promiscuously born to all the same advantages of nature" should logically enjoy the perfect equality among them, as there is no reason to consider anyone inherently more valuable (Locke 8). The only possible foundation for designating some people as superior to others would be if God "by any manifest declaration of his will, set one above another" (Locke 8). Since such divine sanction of superiority is absent, Locke concludes that the natural equality of all representatives of humankind is not to be called into question. Hobbes approaches equality pragmatically and stresses that people in their natural state are equally dangerous, but Locke employs an ethical approach and emphasizes that humans are equally valuable in God's eyes. This disagreement is but the first difference between the two authors based on the fact that Locke includes God as a premise into his political philosophy, while Hobbes does not.<br/><br/>Another characteristic feature of Hobbes' account of the natural state is his interpretation of liberty. According to Hobbes, the state of nature implies unlimited freedom to do whatever is necessary for one's continued existence. The philosopher defines liberty as "the absence of external impediments" in using one's abilities to attain one's goals (Hobbes 79). The primary purpose of every sentient being is to maintain its continued existence. As a consequence, Hobbesian freedom amounts to the unhindered opportunity to do anything that, in one's judgment, would be best suited to preserve one's life and possessions (Hobbes 79). The only limitation to liberty is that a person cannot do anything contradictory to sustaining his or her life or destroying "the means of preserving the same" (Hobbes 79). Apart from that, there are no boundaries, and everyone has "a right to everything, even to one another's body" if that furthers one's survival (Hobbes 80). Thus, natural liberty, as viewed by Hobbes, is the absence of externally enforced obstacles in pursuing one's right to everything to sustain and secure one's continued existence.<br/><br/>Locke also upholds the idea of natural liberty but, unsurprisingly, approaches it in a manner that is significantly different from that of Hobbes. As soon as he begins discussing liberty in the state of nature, he immediately notes that a state of freedom does not equate "a state of license" (Locke 9). The philosopher identifies two specific limitations to human freedom in the state of nature. The first one is identical to that introduce by Hobbes: however free and independent, a person nevertheless "has not liberty to destroy himself" (Locke 9). Yet the second limitation contradicts Hobbes' prepositions directly. According to Locke, every human being has a natural obligation not to "harm another in his life, health, liberty, or possessions" (9). Just as with his interpretation of equality, the author bases this assertion on ethical and religious grounds: people should preserve each other's existence since they are all creations of the same "omnipotent, and infinitely wise maker" (Locke 9). Thus, Locke's limits liberty in the natural state far more stringently than Hobbes by introducing the obligation to refrain from harming both oneself and the others.<br/><br/>The differences between the two authors also manifest in their accounts of justice in the natural state of humanity. As far as Hobbes is concerned, delineating just and unjust practices is merely the matter of the law. There is no jurisprudence in the state of nature, and the only law governing human beings in their original condition is a natural law that only obliges them to seek personal security. As a result, nothing can be unjust in the original state of the humankind: "notions of right and wrong justice and injustice" have no place and no meaning in the absence of the stringently enforced law (Hobbes 78). As long as the people use their virtually unlimited freedom to ruthlessly compete with each other for resources, to which they are equally entitled, they have no criteria to differentiate between just and unjust actions. Therefore, the Hobbesian state of nature defies the very idea of justice since the author interprets it as a mere function of the formalized and established law.<br/><br/>Locke assigns different meaning to justice and views it not so much in legislative as in the ethical terms. This paper already mentioned that, unlike Hobbes, Locke employs ethical notions and generally bases his political philosophy on moral rather than purely practical presumptions. Locke's natural law, unlike that of Hobbes, obliges human beings to take care of each other rather than simply leaving everyone to fend for themselves. As a result, there is a place for justice and injustice in his state of nature. The author points to this fact himself when noting that no one should deprive another of his or her life of the means of preserving it "unless it be to do justice on an offender" (Locke 9). This statement reveals with the utmost clarity that, according to Locke, there is justice in the state of nature, and, moreover, humans have to preserve it actively. The criterion of justice, which Hobbes' natural state lacks, is the second limitation on natural liberty imposed by Locke: an action is unjust if it constitutes an unwarranted threat to another person's life and possessions.<br/><br/>These differences in the two authors' treatment of equality, liberty, and justice or injustice culminate in their interpretation of the relationship between the state of nature and the state of war. From Hobbes's perspective, the two are synonymous, because the ruthless competition is the only logical outcome of putting people with equivalent capabilities and similar needs in an environment with limited resources. He states this connection outright: "if any two men desire the same thing, which nevertheless they cannot both enjoy, they become enemies" and are, therefore, in the state of war with each other (Hobbes 75). Yet since humans are numerous and all possess similar capabilities and needs, this competition manifests not only in the individual interactions but also on the level of humanity as a whole. As long as all humans have equal and unlimited rights to all resources and even to each other's bodies and lives, the state of nature is a war of "every man against every man" (Hobbes 76). This grim interpretation stems directly from Hobbes' portrayal of the state of nature as governed solely by the individuals' egoistic urges.<br/><br/>Locke, on the other hand, differentiates between the state of nature and the state of war and points out that, while they may occur simultaneously, it is no reason to identify one with the other. Locke's definition of the state of war is virtually identical to that offered by Hobbes. According to Locke, "he who attempts to get another man into his absolute power does thereby put himself into a state of war with him" (14). This explanation lines up perfectly with the Hobbesian notion that everyone's universal right to everything, including the other people's bodies and lives, leads to the state of war. Yet Locke refuses to equate the state of war and the state of nature precisely because he denies Hobbes' interpretation of natural freedom. Since Locke's natural state restrains people from harming each other through the second limitation of liberty, an attempt on another person's freedom is a transgression against the natural law. While for Hobbes, war is the humankind's condition by default, Locke portrays it as a perversion of the state of nature rather than its rule.<br/><br/>These differences in delineating the state on nature and its constituents, such as liberty, equality, justice, and war, pave the way to the authors contrasting portrayals of government. Based on his pessimistic assessment of the state of nature, the author of Leviathan concludes that, under conditions of war, there can be no definite hope for "living out the time which nature ordinarily alloweth men to live" (Hobbes 80). The solution is laying down the universal right to everything and leaving everyone "so much liberty against other men, as he would allow other men against himself" (Hobbes 80). The participants of the resulting social contract invest the unlimited liberties they have surrendered into a sovereign – the bearer of the supreme power whose purpose is to preserve the achieved status quo by punishing all transgressions against it. Sovereign's power is absolute: the ruler has the authority "to do whatsoever he shall think necessary" to promote peace between his subjects so that no one would assail another's life or property (113). Hobbes concludes that without such an unassailable figure entitled with the right to do anything to the subjects, there can be no peace and no guarantee of security.<br/><br/>While Locke agrees with the necessity of creating politically organized societies, he nevertheless opposes Hobbes' idea of the sovereign power as unlimited and unassailable. As mentioned above, Locke's state of nature is not nearly as dreadful as that painted by Hobbes because of the people's obligation to preserve not only themselves but each other as well. Therefore, the need for social contract arises not from the fear of the others, but from the sheer convenience. Small communities may not need numerous laws to solve conflicts and "officers to superintend the process," but larger associations find it advisable to institute governments for that purpose (Locke 57). Yet the power of the government cannot be unlimited because it would result in subduing the subjects to an "inconstant, uncertain, unknown, arbitrary will of another man" (Locke 17). Such a government would constitute a twofold violation of the natural law. By agreeing to another person's absolute power over his life, a subject would violate its first limitation prohibiting to harm oneself. As for the ruler, destroying another person's liberty would constitute direct harm and, as such, be contradictory to the second limitation.<br/><br/>As a direct continuation of his case for unlimited governmental authority, Hobbes denies the separation of powers as a principle. From his perspective, the sovereign, once instituted, possesses "the whole power of prescribing the rules" governing the lives of the subjects or, in shorter terms, the legislative power (Hobbes 114). The sovereign also reserves the right of "hearing and deciding all controversies" – that is, the judicial power (Hobbes 114). Finally, since the entire purpose of the sovereign is to force the subjects to refrain from harming each other, there can be no doubt that executive power is also his or her exclusive prerogative. The separation of powers as a concept is alien to Hobbes because of his views on the state of nature. Creating a political entity where the executive, legislative, and judicial branches would check each other – that is, compete – would mean recreating the Hobbesian state of nature-as-war on a higher level. Since the people enter a social contract and institute a government to put the state of nature behind them, not reinstate it in a different form, the separation of powers contradictory Hobbes' views directly.<br/><br/>Locke, on the other hand, embraces separation of power as a foundational principle of his political theory. His case for the separation is evident in the discussion of the limits of the legislative power. As Locke puts it, it would be hardly advisable "for the same persons, who have the power of making laws, to have also in their hands the power to execute them" (76). The philosopher points to the imperfections of human nature and the inherent desire to "grasp at power" as a rationale for this precautionary measure (Locke 76). Just as in Hobbes' case, Locke's account of the separation of powers stems directly from his interpretation of the state of nature. If there is already justice in the state of nature and the people can understand it, any government is inevitably subject to the same natural law. Since absolute power over people violates both limitations of this law, separating and distributing it is advisable so that the government would function appropriately.<br/><br/>This paper has demonstrated that, while the differences between Hobbes' and Locke's accounts of the natural state of humanity are numerous, they ultimately amount to the presence of absence of moral premises. Hobbes views the natural state as that of unlimited liberty, where people endowed with equal capabilities and not bound by any moral notions, such as justice, compete for the resources unceasingly. Locke, however, interprets equality and liberty ethically rather than practically and opines that war is a perversion of the natural state, as the natural law obliges humans not to harm each other. This disagreement influences the philosophers' approaches to government. Hobbes insists on an all-powerful ruler, as, in the absence of ethical restraints, no other authority could force the humans to refrain from harming each other. Yet, in Locke's view, granting the government unlimited powers would be contradictory to the ethical limitations embedded in the law of nature, which is why he, unlike Hobbes, advocates separation of powers. | Hobbes' vs. Lockes forteljing om naturtilstanden<br/><br/>Emne: FilosofiOrd: 2539Sidenamn: 9Aug 3rd, 2021<br/><br/>Hobbes og Locke er blant dei mest innverknadsrike politiske filosofane som nokon gong har skrive på engelsk. Naturtilstanden, som går føre organiseringa av dei komplekse samfunna, er den felles føresetnaden som både Hobbes og Locke deler, men tolkar på ulike måtar. Dei tidlegare ser på menneska i deira naturlege tilstand som like farlege og frie til å forfølge sine egoistiske mål uinnskrenka av dei ikkje-eksisterande forestillingane om rettferd, og difor utgjer hans naturlege tilstand «krigen til kvart menneske mot kvart menneske» (Hobbes76). Sistnemnde ser derimot på menneska i deira opphavlege tilstand som like verdifulle og avgrensar den naturlege fridomen ved ideen om rettferd som krev at ein ikkje skal skade andre, noko som gjer det mogleg å definere naturtilstanden som «gjensidig assistanse og bevaring» framfor krig (Locke 15). Hovudskilnaden mellom dei to filosofane sine forteljingar om naturtilstanden er at Locke nyttar etiske vurderingar medan Hobbes ikkje gjer det, og det fører til slutt til at Hobbes ser for seg ein stat som utøver uavgrensa makt over menneske, medan Locke avgrensar regjeringa etter dei moralske prinsippa, som han reknar som ei naturlov.<br/><br/>Hobbes baserer sine antakelser om naturtilstanden på det faktum at alle menneske er omtrent like i sine fysiske og mentale evner. Han innrømmer at enkelte individ kan vise større fysisk styrke eller overlegne intellekt, men insisterer på at «når alt blir rekna saman, er skilnaden mellom menneske og menneske ikkje så stor» (Hobbes 74). Sidan menneska stort sett er likeverdige i evne, har dei òg liknande håp om å nå sine mål og tilfredsstille sine behov (Hobbes 75). Som eit logisk resultat av denne likskapen, når folket byrjar å konkurrere om knappe ressursar, kan ingen føle seg heilt trygge i eigedomane sine. Sjølv om ein mektig, utspekulert og dyktig person greier å underkue «personane til alle menneske han kan», garanterer det likevel ikkje den ultimate tryggleiken (Hobbes 75). Ettersom ingen menneske kan oppnå ei slik overlegenheit over dei andre som gjer han eller henne fullstendig immun mot deira intellektuelle styrke, kan ingen menneske føle seg heilt trygge når dei er omgjevne av sine likemenn. Hobbes sin likskap i naturtilstanden er likskap i frykt, der alle menneske ser på kvarandre som farlege konkurrentar.<br/><br/>I likskap med Hobbes reknar Locke alle menneska som fundamentalt likeverdige, men tileignar uttrykket ei heilt anna meining. Frå hans perspektiv er det ikkje likskapen i evner, men heller likskapen i verdi. Han meiner at folket «promiskuøst fødd med alle dei same fortrinna i naturen» logisk sett bør nyte den perfekte likskapen mellom dei, sidan det ikkje er nokon grunn til å sjå på nokon som i seg sjølv er meir verdfull (Locke 8). Det einaste moglege grunnlaget for å utpeike somme menneske som overordna andre ville vere om Gud «ved ei eller anna tilkjennegjeving av hans vilje sette den eine over den andre» (Locke 8). Sidan slik guddommeleg sanksjon av overlegenheit er fråverande, konkluderer Locke med at den naturlege likskapen til alle representantar for menneska ikkje skal bli stilt spørsmål ved. Hobbes tilnærmar seg likskap pragmatisk og legg vekt på at menneske i deira naturlege tilstand er like farlege, men Locke nyttar ein etisk tilnærming og legg vekt på at menneske er like verdifulle i Guds auge. Denne usemja er berre den første skilnaden mellom dei to forfattarane basert på at Locke inkluderer Gud som premiss i sin politiske filosofi, medan Hobbes ikkje gjer det.<br/><br/>Eit anna kjenneteikn ved skildringa til Hobbes av naturtilstanden er tolkinga hans av fridom. I følgje Hobbes inneber naturtilstanden uavgrensa fridom til å gjere det som er naudsynt for at ein skal kunne halde fram med å eksistere. Filosofen definerer fridom som «fråværet av ytre hindringar» i å bruke evnene sine til å nå måla sine (Hobbes 79). Det primære føremålet med kvart kjenslemessig vesen er å halde fram med å eksistere. Som følgje av dette utgjer den hobbesiske fridomen den uhindra moglegheita til å gjere kva som helst som ein meiner ville vore best mogleg til å ta vare på ein sitt liv og eigedomar (Hobbes 79). Den einaste avgrensinga på fridomen er at ein person ikkje kan gjere noko som er i motsetnad til å oppretthalde livet sitt eller øydeleggje «midla for å bevare det same» (Hobbes 79). Bortsett frå det er det ingen grenser, og alle har «rett til alt, jamvel til kvarandres kropp» om det fremjar ein sin overleving (Hobbes 80). Naturleg fridom, slik Hobbes ser det, er dermed fråværet av ytre påtvungne hindringar for å forfølgje retten til alt for å oppretthalde og sikra den vidare eksistensen.<br/><br/>Locke held òg fram ideen om naturleg fridom, men nærmar seg det på ein måte som er vesentleg forskjellig frå den til Hobbes. Så snart han byrjar å diskutere fridom i naturtilstanden, legg han straks merke til at ein fridomstilstand ikkje er lik «en fridomstilstand» (Locke 9). Filosofen identifiserer to spesifikke avgrensingar for menneskefridom i naturtilstanden. Den første er identisk med den Hobbes introduserte: men fri og uavhengig, ein person har likevel «ikkje fridom til å øydeleggje seg sjølv» (Locke 9), men den andre avgrensinga motset seg direkte preposisjonane til Hobbes. I følgje Locke har kvart menneske ei naturleg plikt til ikkje å «skada andre i livet, helsa, fridomen eller eigedomane sine» (9). På same måte som med tolkinga si av likskap, baserer forfattaren denne påstanden på etiske og religiøse grunnar: folk skal ta vare på kvarandre sin eksistens sidan dei alle er skapt av den same «allmektige og uendeleg vise skaparen» (Locke 9). Locke avgrensar dermed fridomen i naturtilstanden langt strengare enn Hobbes ved å innføre plikta til å avstå frå å skade både seg sjølv og dei andre.<br/><br/>Skilnadene mellom dei to forfattarane kjem òg til syne i skildringane deira av rettferda i den naturlege tilstanden til menneska. Det finst ingen rettsvitskap i naturtilstanden, og den einaste lova som styrer menneske i deira opphavlege tilstand er ei naturlov som berre forpliktar dei til å søkje personleg tryggleik. Som følgje av dette kan ingenting vere urettferdig i den opphavlege tilstanden til menneska: «omgrepa rett og urett rett og urett» har ingen plass og ingen meining i fråværet av den strengt handheva lova (Hobbes 78). Så lenge folket nyttar sin tilnærma uavgrensa fridom til nådelaust å konkurrere med kvarandre om ressursar, som dei har like rett til, har dei ingen kriterium for å skilje mellom rettferdige og urettferdige handlingar. Den hobbesiske naturtilstanden trossar derfor sjølve ideen om rettferd, sidan forfattaren tolkar han som berre ein funksjon av den formaliserte og etablerte lova.<br/><br/>Locke tilskriv ulike tydingar til rettferd og ser det ikkje så mykje i lovgjevande som i etiske tydingar. Denne avhandlinga nemner allereie at Locke, i motsetnad til Hobbes, nyttar seg av etiske idear og generelt baserer sin politiske filosofi på moralske heller enn reint praktiske presumpsjonar. Lockes naturlov, i motsetnad til Hobbes sin, forpliktar menneska til å ta vare på kvarandre i staden for berre å la alle klare seg sjølv. Forfattaren peikar sjølv på dette når han merkar seg at ingen skal berøve ein annan livet sitt med middel til å ta vare på det «med mindre det er å gjere rett mot ein lovbrytar» (Locke 9). Denne nemninga syner med største klarheit at det i følgje Locke finst rettferd i naturtilstanden, og i tillegg må menneske ta aktivt vare på denne. Rettferdskriteriet, som Hobbes naturlege tilstand manglar, er den andre avgrensinga av den naturlege fridomen som Locke innførte: ei handling er urettferdig dersom ho utgjer ein uberettiget trussel mot ein annan person sitt liv og eigedomar.<br/><br/>Desse skilnadene i dei to forfattarane si behandling av likeverd, fridom og rettferd eller urettferdigheit kulminerer i deira tolking av forholdet mellom naturtilstanden og krigstilstanden. Frå Hobbes sitt perspektiv er dei to synonyme, fordi den nådelause konkurransen er det einaste logiske resultatet av å plassere folk med tilsvarande evner og liknande behov i eit miljø med avgrensa ressursar. Han seier denne samanhengen rett ut: «dersom to menn ynskjer det same, noko dei likevel ikkje kan nyte, blir dei fiendar» og er difor i krigstilstand med kvarandre (Hobbes 75). Men sidan menneska er talrike og alle har liknande evner og behov, viser denne konkurransen seg ikkje berre i dei individuelle samhandlingane, men òg på nivået til menneska som heilskap. Så lenge alle menneske har lik og uavgrensa rett til alle ressursar og jamvel til kvarandre sine kroppar og liv, er naturtilstanden ein krig «einhver mann mot ein annan» (Hobbes 76). Denne dystre tydinga stammar direkte frå Hobbes si framstilling av naturtilstanden som berre er styrt av individa sine egoistiske drifter.<br/><br/>Locke skil derimot mellom naturtilstanden og krigstilstanden og peikar på at sjølv om dei kan skje samstundes, er det ingen grunn til å identifisere seg med kvarandre. I følgje Locke «den som prøver å få ein annan mann i sin absolutte makt, set han dermed seg sjølv i krigstilstand med han» (14). Denne forklaringa samsvarar perfekt med den hobbesiske oppfatninga om at alles universelle rett til alt, inkludert dei andre sine kroppar og liv, fører til krigstilstand. Likevel nektar Locke å likestille krigstilstanden med naturtilstanden nettopp fordi han nektar for Hobbes si tolking av naturfridom. Sidan den naturlege tilstanden til Locke hindrar folk frå å skade kvarandre gjennom den andre avgrensinga av fridomen, er eit forsøk på fridomen til ein annan person eit brot på naturlova. For Hobbes er krig som standard tilstanden til menneska, men Locke skildrar det som ei forvrenging av naturtilstanden i staden for regelen.<br/><br/>Desse skilnadene i avgrensinga av staten på naturen og dens bestanddelar, som fridom, likeverd, rettferd og krig, baner vegen for forfattarane i motstridande framstillingar av regjeringa. Ut frå hans pessimistiske vurdering av naturtilstanden konkluderer forfattaren av Leviathan med at det under krigstilhøve ikkje kan finnast noko bestemt håp om å «leve ut den tida som naturen vanlegvis tillèt menneska å leve» (Hobbes 80). Løysinga er å leggje ned den universelle retten til alt og la alle få «så mykje fridom mot andre menneske, som han ville tillate andre menneske mot seg sjølv» (Hobbes 80). Deltakarane i den resulterende sosiale kontrakten investerer dei uavgrensa fridomane dei har overgjeve til ein suveren – beraren av den suverene makta som har som føremål å bevare det oppnådde status quo ved å straffe alle brotsverk mot det. Suvereniteten sin makt er absolutt: Herskaren har autoritet til å "gje det han meiner er nødvendig" for å fremje fred mellom undersåttane sine, slik at ingen vil overfalle livet eller eigedomen til andre (113). Hobbes konkluderer med at utan ein slik uangripeleg person med rett til å gjere noko med undersåttane, kan det ikkje bli fred og ingen garanti for tryggleik.<br/><br/>Locke er samd i at det er naudsynt å skape politisk organiserte samfunn, men han motsetter seg likevel Hobbes sin ide om suveren makt som uavgrensa og uangripeleg. Som nemnt ovanfor er ikkje Locke sin naturtilstand nær så grufull som den Hobbes teikna på grunn av plikta til folket til å ta vare på ikkje berre seg sjølv, men òg på kvarandre. Behovet for sosial kontrakt oppstår difor ikkje av frykt for dei andre, men av den reine bekvemmeligheten. Små samfunn treng kanskje ikkje talrike lover for å løyse konfliktar og «offiserar for å føre tilsyn med prosessen», men større foreiningar finn det tilrådd å opprette styresmakter for dette føremålet (Locke 57). Likevel kan ikkje makta til styresmaktene vere uavgrensa fordi det ville føre til at undersåttane vart underordna ein «ustadig, usikker, ukjend, vilkårleg vilje til ein annan mann» (Locke 17). Ei slik styresmakt ville utgjere eit dobbelt brot på naturlova. Ved å godta den absolutte makta til ein annan person over livet sitt, ville eit subjekt overtre den første avgrensinga som forbyr å skade seg sjølv. Når det gjeld herskaren, ville det å øydeleggje fridomen til ein annan person innebere direkte skade og som sådan vere i strid med den andre avgrensinga.<br/><br/>Som ei direkte vidareføring av saka hans om uavgrensa regjeringsmakt, nektar Hobbes for maktfordeling som prinsipp. Frå hans perspektiv har suverenen, når han først er innført, «hele makta til å foreskrive reglane» som styrer liva til undersåttane eller, i kortare vendingar, den lovgjevande makta (Hobbes 114). Suvereniteten forbeholder seg òg retten til å «høre og avgjere alle kontroversar» – det vil seie den dømmende makta (Hobbes 114). Til slutt, sidan heile føremålet til suverenen er å tvinge undersåttane til å avstå frå å skade kvarandre, kan det ikkje vera tvil om at den utøvande makta òg er hans eller hennar einerett. Skiljet mellom makter som konsept er framandt for Hobbes på grunn av hans syn på naturtilstanden. Å skape ei politisk eining der dei utøvande, lovgjevande og dømmende greinene kontrollerer kvarandre – det vil seia konkurrerende – ville innebere å gjenskape den hobbesiske natur-som-krigstilstanden på eit høgare nivå. Sidan folket går inn i ein sosial kontrakt og innfører ei regjering for å leggje naturtilstanden bak seg, og ikkje gjeninnføre den i ei anna form, vil maktskilnaden direkte motsetje Hobbes sitt syn.<br/><br/>Locke, derimot, omfamnar maktskiljet som eit grunnprinsipp i den politiske teorien sin, og argumentet hans for skiljet er tydeleg i diskusjonen om grensene for den lovgjevande makta. Som Locke uttrykker det, ville det neppe vere rådleg «for dei same personane, som har makt til å stifte lover, å ha òg makt til å verkeleggjera dei» (76). Filosofen peikar på ufullkommenheitene i menneskenaturen og det iboende ønsket om å «gripe makta» som eit rasjonal for dette førebyggjande tiltaket (Locke 76). Akkurat som i Hobbes sitt tilfelle kjem Lockes skildring av maktfordelinga direkte frå tydinga hans av naturtilstanden. Dersom det allereie finst rettferd i naturtilstanden og folket kan forstå det, er alle styresmakter uunngåeleg underlagt den same naturlova. Sidan absolutt makt over menneske bryt begge avgrensingane i denne lova, er det tilrådeleg å skilje og fordele ho slik at regjeringa vil fungere høveleg.<br/><br/>Denne oppgåva har vist at sjølv om skilnadene mellom Hobbes og Locke om den naturlege tilstanden til menneska er mangfaldige, så er dei til slutt fråverande av moralske premissar. Hobbes ser på den naturlege tilstanden som ein tilstand av uavgrensa fridom, der folk som er utstyrte med like evner og ikkje er bundne av nokre moralske tydingar, som til dømes rettferd, konkurrerer uavlateleg om ressursane. Locke tolkar derimot likskap og fridom etisk heller enn praktisk og meiner at krig er ei forvrenging av naturtilstanden, ettersom naturlova forpliktar menneske til ikkje å skade kvarandre. Hobbes insisterte på ein allmektig herskar, sidan ingen andre autoritetar kunne tvinge menneska til å avstå frå å skade kvarandre. Likevel, etter Locke sitt syn, ville det å gje styresmaktene uavgrensa makt vere i strid med dei etiske avgrensingane som er innebygd i naturlova, og det er difor han, i motsetnad til Hobbes, går inn for maktskilje. |
| Fashion Police: What Game of Thrones threw up<br/><br/>Canadian-French singer Abbas Hasan put blinding effort to outshine all of humanity at Fashion Parade 2014. Nothing wrong with that, except safety is priority and the musician is a health hazard here.<br/><br/>We get he wants to be a star. Sadly, he didn't get the memo where they tell the desperate and the infamous that stardom is a metaphor. You don't have to look like one and literally set our sight ablaze. Also, the All Pakistan Aunty Association has officially lodged a complaint against him. The local market has run dry of fake crystals and sequined monstrosities. They have nothing to wear to their biweekly high teas and they claim he is to blame. Apparently, the outfit is inspired by Game of Thrones. Can he please stick to composing sad songs about his neighbour's dead dog instead of conceptualising outfits? Or maybe it's the trauma of losing the dog, whose death he is clearly not over as he is still wearing its carcass.<br/><br/>The charge sheet Outfit<br/><br/>No one can decide where the outfit begins and where Abbas ends. You stare in fascination, sinking into a deep abyss and wonder why he is wearing leather pants. Whose horse did he kill to steal the saddle draped across his shoulders? Was he in prison right before his red carpet appearance and forgot to take off the chains? How will he survive the synthetic leather and post-sequin rash that is bound to be lethal in such high dosage? Why am I still alive?<br/><br/>Idea<br/><br/>His inspiration was seemingly Game of Thrones, but he eventually ended up looking like he was thrown out of a Viking restaurant. Had he come across any of the characters from the show, he would've been slain in the first five seconds of the first episode.<br/><br/>The mental health or lack thereof: Someone get him to a counsellor ASAP! He seems to be under the assumption that wearing a dead dog means that the only friend he had in his life is still alive. Dear Abbas:<br/><br/>1. Denial is not a river in Egypt<br/><br/>2. Your tortured psyche is not helping your music, so get help<br/><br/>3. Try imaginary friends<br/><br/>Bail out!<br/><br/>All of us at the Fashion Police headquarters are severely traumatised. Abbas is someone we did not enjoy arresting. He is currently in custody and attempting revenge by putting on attires from other fantasy shows. He just glitter glued himself in order to look like Edward Cullen from Twilight. As a public service message and to prevent further nervous breakdowns, we gave him the following examples of men from the red carpet of the same event.<br/><br/>Zohaib Hassan<br/><br/>When in doubt, play it safe. The singer looks like your average uncle at a shaadi. A plain black suit with no accessories, even if it's a tad disproportionate, is workable. Zohaib's look is blended into everything and nothing, and when you don't have a fashion sense or the money to hire a stylist, this is okay. It does not carry the risk of cardiac arrest for fellow attendees at an event. Given Abbas' delicate mental condition, this look is what he should aim for. Always and forever.<br/><br/>Ali Zafar<br/><br/>One day, after decades of therapy, Abbas could aspire to wear attire like Ali Zafar's. The dapper summer look is done to near perfection. Ali came really close to looking like a maître d at a French restaurant with his white summer jacket with black lapels, but the shirt saves it, never mind the satin. His pants would have been ridiculous had they not been folded at the ankles. The shoes are what hipster chic happy endings are made of. | Det første spelet kom ut i 1987 med namnet The Game of Thrones .<br/><br/>Den kanadiske-franske songaren Abbas Hasan la ein blindande innsats for å overgå heile menneskeheita på Fashion Parade 2014. Ingenting galt med det, bortsett frå at tryggleiken er prioritert og musikaren er ein helsefare her.<br/><br/>Vi forstår at han ønskjer å bli ei stjerne. Dessverre fekk han ikkje notatet der dei fortel dei desperate og berykta at stjernestatus er ein metafor. Du treng ikkje å sjå ut som ein og bokstaveleg talt sette synet vårt i brann. Også All Pakistan Aunty Association har offisielt klaga han. Den lokale marknaden har gått tørr av falske krystallar og paljetterte monster. Dei har ingenting å ha på seg til sine to veker høge te, og dei hevdar han er skulda. Kan han vere så snill å halde seg til å komponere triste songar om den døde hunden til naboen i staden for å konseptualisere drakter? Eller kanskje det er trauma av å miste hunden, som han tydeleg ikkje er over da han framleis har på seg kadaveret.<br/><br/>Utsjånad på laddarket<br/><br/>Du stirer fascinert ned i ei djup avgrunn og lurer på kvifor han har på seg skinnbukser. Kven sin hest drap han for å stjele salen drapert over skuldra? Var han i fengsel rett før den raude teppeutsjånaden sin og gløymde å ta av lenkene? Korleis skal han overleve det syntetiske skinnet og post-sequin utslettet som er bundet til å være dødelig i så høg dosering? Kvifor er eg enno i live?<br/><br/>Ide<br/><br/>Inspirasjonen hans var tilsynelatande Game of Thrones, men han ende opp med å sjå ut som han vart kasta ut av ein vikingrestaurant. Hadde han kom over nokon av karakterane frå showet, ville han ha blitt drepen i dei første fem sekunda av den første episoden.<br/><br/>Psykisk helse eller mangel på det: Nokon får han til ein rådgjevar ASAP! Han ser ut til å vere under forutsetning av at det å ha på seg ein død hund betyr at den einaste venen han hadde i livet hans framleis er i live.<br/><br/>1. Fornekting er ikkje ei elv i Egypt<br/><br/>2. Den torturerte psyken din hjelper ikkje musikken din, så få hjelp<br/><br/>3. Prøv fantasivennar<br/><br/>Ut med kausjonen!<br/><br/>Abbas er ein person vi ikkje likte å arrestere. Han er for tida i varetekt og prøver å ta hevn ved å kle seg ut frå andre fantasy-show. Han limte seg berre fast for å sjå ut som Edward Cullen frå Twilight. Som ei offentleg tenestemelding og for å hindre ytterlegare nervøse samanbrot gav vi han følgjande døme på menn frå raude teppet frå same hendinga.<br/><br/>Zohaib Hassan<br/><br/>Når du er i tvil, spel det trygt. Songaren ser ut som den vanlege onkelen din på ein shaadi. Ein enkel svart dress utan tilbehør, sjølv om det er litt uforholdsmessig, er brukbar. Utsjånaden til Zohaib blandar seg inn i alt og ingenting, og når du ikkje har kjensle for mote eller pengar til å leie ein stylist, er dette greitt. Det medfører ikkje risiko for hjartestans for deltakarane på eit arrangement. Han var alvorleg sjuk, ja, døden nær. Men det gjorde han fordi han alltid og i all æve hadde lengta etter å få sjå han att.<br/><br/>Ali ZafarName<br/><br/>Ein dag, etter fleire tiår med terapi, kunne Abbas håpe på å kle seg ut som Ali Zafar. Ali kom veldig nær å sjå ut som ein maître d på ein fransk restaurant i den kvite sommarjakken sin med svarte lapels, men skjorten reddar han, uansett satinen. Buksene hans ville ha vore latterlige om dei ikkje hadde blitt bretta ved anklane. Skoa er det hipster chic happy endingar er laga av. |
| Determining soil hydraulic properties with different wetting liquids : A thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the Degree of Master of Science at Lincoln University<br/><br/>Abstract<br/><br/>Soil hydraulic properties such as hydraulic conductivity, water retention and plant water relationships dominate the water movement processes. For example, the infiltration, evaporation and water flow within the soil. As a widespread phenomenon in soil, soil water repellency alters the soil hydraulic functions by resisting the water flow into the soils. Moreover, the hydraulic properties not only depend on the pore system of soil but also are affected by the physicochemical properties of the pore surfaces. Compared to water, ethanol is not affected by the water repellency due to its lower surface tension. The purpose of using ethanol is to eliminate the effect of soil water repellency on hydraulic properties measurements. However, applying pure ethanol into natural soil can degrade the soil organic materials and lead to changes in physical properties. Therefore, the aqueous ethanol solutions can be an alternative option. Nevertheless, the feasibility of using aqueous ethanol for determining soil liquid retention curve remains unknown. This study aims to test the feasibility of the aqueous ethanol solutions (0, 10 %, 20 %, 30 %, 40 %, 50 % and 100 % v/v) for establishing liquid retention curve under a small range of applied pressure in coarse sand samples with different wettability and organic amended natural soil (Templeton silt loam (TSL) with mushroom compost, biochar, dairy effluent, and municipal compost, the application rate was 15 % by weight). The result showed that the desorption of testing aqueous ethanol solutions compared to water was quicker by approximately 1 to 3x based on the liquid content at the same applied pressure and the time for reaching each equilibrium. The outcomes from the sand experiment suggested that when the concentration of aqueous ethanol solution was below 50 %, the losses via evaporation were less than 1% and the relative differences between testing liquid and water was lower than 10 %. However, the evaporation losses were 11.06 % and 24.6 %, and the relative differences were all around 15 % and 30 % in 50 % and 100 % ethanol solution, respectively. In contrast, the organic amendments in Templeton silt loam not only increased the water retention capability but also reduced the evaporation losses. The evaporation losses in TSL soil and TSL with organic amendments soil were with 1 % in solutions with less than 50 % ethanol content. Evaporation losses of 50 % and 100 % ethanol were 2.8 % and 2.9 %, respectively. The relative differences between water and testing liquid were similar to the sand experiment when the testing liquid concentrations were below 50 %. However, the relative differences in 50 % and 100 % ethanol solution were smaller than in the sand sample with around 10 % and 15%, respectively. Additionally, the analysis of relative difference suggested that almost all aqueous ethanol solutions had lower volumetric liquid content at the same supplied pressure compared to water, which was a reflection of the aqueous ethanol solutions desorbed faster than water under equivalent pressure. Therefore, 10 % to 40 % of ethanol solutions could be considered an alternative for determining soil hydraulic properties due to their faster desorption rate and not being affected by soil water repellency. Due to the evaporation and dissolution of organic material, aqueous ethanol solutions above 50% concentration were not suitable for coarse sand or medium-textured soil.... [Show full abstract] | Bestemme jordhydrauliske eigenskapar med ulike fuktevæsker : Ein avhandling levert i delvis oppfylling av krava til Master of Science-graden ved Lincoln University<br/><br/>Abstrakt<br/><br/>Hydrauliske eigenskapar som hydraulisk ledningsevne, vassretensjon og forhold mellom plantevatn dominerer vassrørslene, til dømes infiltrasjonen, fordampinga og vassføringa i jorda. Som eit utbreidd fenomen i jordsmonnet, endrar jordvatnsavvising dei hydrauliske funksjonane i jordsmonnet ved å motstå vassføringa inn i jordsmonnet. Dessutan er dei hydrauliske eigenskapane ikkje berre avhengige av poresystemet i jordsmonnet, men er òg påverka av dei fysisk-kjemiske eigenskapane til poreoverflata. Samanlikna med vatn er ikkje etanol påverka av vassmotstanden på grunn av den lågare overflatespenninga. Føremålet med å bruke etanol er å eliminere effekten av jordvatnavvising på målingar av hydrauliske eigenskapar, men bruk av rein etanol i naturleg jord kan forringe dei organiske stoffa i jorda og føre til endringar i fysiske eigenskapar. Derfor kan vandige etanolløysingar vere eit alternativ, men det er uvisst om det er mogleg å bruke vandig etanol for å bestemme væskeretensjonskurva til jord. Denne studien tar sikte på å teste gjennomførbarheten av dei vandige etanolløysingane (0, 10 %, 20 %, 30 %, 40 %, 50 % og 100 % v/v) for å etablere væskeretensjonskurve under eit lite område av påført trykk i grovsandprøver med ulik fuktbarhet og organisk endra naturleg jordsmonn (Templeton silt loam (TSL) med soppkompost, biokull, meiert % avløpe, og kommunalt avløp. Resultatet viste at desorpsjonen av å testa vandige etanolløysingar samanlikna med vatn var raskare med om lag 1 til 3 gonger basert på væskeinnhaldet ved same påførte trykk og tida for å nå kvar likevekt. Resultata frå sandeksperimentet tydde på at når konsentrasjonen av vandig etanolløysing var under 50 %, var tapa via fordamping mindre enn 1 % og dei relative skilnadene mellom å teste væske og vatn var lågare enn 10 %. Fordampingstapa var likevel 11,06 % og 24,6 %, og dei relative skilnadene var alle rundt 15 % og 30 % i høvesvis 50 % og 100 % etanolløysing. Dei organiske endringane i leirjorda i Templeton auka derimot ikkje berre vasshaldigheita, men reduserte òg fordampingstapa. Fordampingstapet i TSL-jord og TSL-jord med organiske endringar var med 1 % i løysingar med mindre enn 50 % etanolinnhald. Fordampingstapet på 50 % og 100 % etanol var høvesvis 2,8 % og 2,9 %. Den relative skilnaden mellom vatn og testvæske var lik sandeksperimentet då testvæskekonsentrasjonane var under 50 %. Dei relative skilnadene i 50 % og 100 % etanolløysing var likevel mindre enn i sandprøven med om lag 10 % og 15 %. I tillegg tydde analysen av relativ skilnad at nesten alle vandige etanolløysingar hadde lågare volumetrisk væskeinnhald ved det same tilførte trykket samanlikna med vatn, noko som var ein refleksjon av at dei vandige etanolløysingane desorberte raskare enn vatn under ekvivalent trykk. Derfor kunne 10–40 % av etanolløysingar reknast som eit alternativ til å avgjere jordhydrauliske eigenskapar på grunn av den raskare desorpsjonshastigheita og at dei ikkje vart påverka av jordvatnsavvising. På grunn av fordamping og oppløysing av organisk materiale, var vandige etanolløysingar over 50 % konsentrasjon ikkje eigna for grov sand eller middels strukturert jord.... [Vis heile samandraget] |
