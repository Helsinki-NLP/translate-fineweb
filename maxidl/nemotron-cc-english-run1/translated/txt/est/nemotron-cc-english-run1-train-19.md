| Quidditch through the ages<br/><br/>I was doodling some quidditch-related objects like broomsticks and snitches and whatnot and it sort of turned into this odd compilation of things, including Harry down there at the bottom. I am not completely satisfied with the way it came out, but since it's not bad for my second Harry Potter fan-art picture, I decided to color it anyway. If you are wondering where his scar is, it's there, but it's very very light and small because I did that bit on the computer. Sketched in pen, colored in Paint. | Kvidiit läbi aegade<br/><br/>Ma mõtisklesin mõnede quidditchiga seotud asjade üle, nagu luudikepid ja luuserid ja mis iganes, ja see muutus mingisuguseks veidraks asjade kogumiks, sealhulgas Harry seal all. Ma ei ole täiesti rahul, kuidas see välja tuli, kuid kuna see ei ole halb minu teine Harry Potter fänn-art pilt, ma otsustasin, et värvi see niikuinii. Kui te ei tea, kus tema arm on, see on seal, kuid see on väga väga kerge ja väike, sest ma tegin seda arvutis. |
| I just started saltwater fly fishing this summer and I need a new reel, so it'll definitely be the Kraken. (I'm in Florida; we don't have those little trout minnow things around here. ) Private Message on the way to you.<br/><br/>I'm thrilled and flattered. I'm also trying to figure out a way to explain to She-Who-Must-Be-Obeyed that I'll need to buy a new rod worthy of this reel.....<br/><br/>I've always found that no explanation is the best explanation. Don't give her a reason to ever say you're not spontaneous enough. | Ma just alustasin sel suvel soolase vee kärbsepüüki ja mul on vaja uut rulli, nii et see on kindlasti Kraken. (Ma olen Floridas; meil ei ole neid väikeseid forelli minnow asju siin. ) Privaatne sõnum teel teie juurde.<br/><br/>Ma olen põnevil ja meelitatud. Ma püüan ka välja mõelda, kuidas selgitada She-Kes-peab-Ob-Obeyedile, et ma pean ostma uue varda, mis on selle rulli vääriline .....<br/><br/>Ma olen alati arvanud, et ükski seletus pole parim seletus, ära anna talle põhjust öelda, et sa pole piisavalt spontaanne. |
| If you were admitted and enrolled --> yes If you were admitted and attended another school --> yes If you took extension courses (do they even have them there? I know UCLA does) --> yes If you went to graduate school there --> yes<br/><br/>That's my interpretation because any of these scenarios would fulfill either being "admitted to an undergraduate program" or "taking courses" at UC Berkeley. I could be completely wrong though, you're better off just calling them and clarifying your specific situation.<br/><br/>My opinion: Based on the wording, I interpreted it as asking if you were admitted to Berkeley undergrad, whether or not you chose to attend. If it meant admitted and attended, they could easily have seen that through the "Undergrad Institutions" portion of the application. | Kui teid võeti vastu ja registreeriti --> jah Kui teid võeti vastu ja osalesite teises koolis --> jah Kui te võtsite laienduskursusi (kas neil on neid isegi seal? Ma tean, et UCLA teeb) --> jah Kui te läksite seal kõrgkooli --> jah<br/><br/>See on minu tõlgendus, sest kõik need stsenaariumid vastaksid kas "lubatud bakalaureuse programmi" või "võttes kursused" UC Berkeley. Ma võin täiesti eksida, aga sa parem lihtsalt helistada neile ja selgitada oma konkreetset olukorda.<br/><br/>Minu arvamus: Sõnastuse põhjal tõlgendasin seda nii, et küsisin, kas teid lubatakse Berkeley ülikooli, kas te otsustate osaleda või mitte. Kui see tähendas tunnistas ja osales, nad oleksid võinud kergesti näha, et läbi "Undergrad Institutions" osa taotluse. |

And as TTT says at a relatively low torque. After that, further tightening both increases the torque load and the head angle ??<br/><br/>To me it's a distinction between measurement techniques rather then final result.

| Winter Protection for Fig Trees<br/><br/>Report This Article<br/><br/>Winter Protection for Fig Trees<br/><br/>Overview<br/><br/>The fig tree has been around since at least 5,000 B.C., and is grown throughout the world for its delicious fruit. Figs grow well in a mild climate without weather extremes. The fig tree is now propagated in some areas with harsh winters. Protective precautions are required to save the tree from winter damage.<br/><br/>Potted Fig Trees<br/><br/>Ornamental fig trees in pots can stand some freezing and do not require light once they enter the winter dormancy phase. Avoid extreme swings in temperature by placing the fig tree in a controlled environment such as a garage, where temperatures range between slightly under freezing and slight above. The plant should be watered as the soil dries.<br/><br/>Shielding<br/><br/>Shielding to protect the tree from the most extreme winter weather is required. Fig trees require placement in soil areas where the soil does not freeze to protect it from disease and increase its chances of winter survival. Large screens placed around the tree protects it from winter winds that can damage and freeze the wood.<br/><br/>Wrapping<br/><br/>Tree wrapping protects the tree from cold weather and prevents hard winds from destroying the branches. Fig tree wrapping should be applied once the leaves from the tree have fallen to prevent leaves from rotting inside the wrapping material. Fig trees are sensitive to slight temperature changes. It can not warm up inside the protective film or else the tree may begin to grow, making it susceptible to severe damage during the cold snap.<br/><br/>Planting<br/><br/>Cultivar practices help to protect the fig tree during harsh winters. Varieties that are resistant to cold weather are best for locations where the weathers are harsh. Brown Turkey, Brunswick and Blue Celeste are good cultivars for cold weather. Planting should be done against a wall or structure that will radiate heat towards the tree during the winter months.<br/><br/>Snow<br/><br/>Roots of the fig tree require dry soil during the winter dormancy period. Watering should be done only when the soil is dry and the roots should be protected from melting snow and rain. Protection placed on the ground under the tree, near the trunk--to keep water from draining into the soil--protects the tree from damage.<br/><br/>Keywords:<br/>fig tree protection, fig tree winter, fig tree care | Talvekaitse viigipuudele<br/><br/>Teata sellest artiklist<br/><br/>Talvekaitse viigipuudele<br/><br/>Ülevaade<br/><br/>Viigipuu on olnud umbes alates vähemalt 5000 B.C. ja seda kasvatatakse kogu maailmas selle maitsvate puuviljade jaoks. Viigimarjad kasvavad hästi pehmes kliimas ilma äärmuslike ilmastikutingimusteta. Viigipuu on nüüd levinud mõnedes karmide talvedega piirkondades. Puude kaitsmiseks talvekahjustuste eest on vaja ettevaatusabinõusid.<br/><br/>Pottitud viigipuud<br/><br/>Pottides asuvad dekoratiivsed viigipuud võivad taluda külmutamist ja ei vaja talve puhkefaasi sisenemisel valgust. Vältige äärmuslikke temperatuurikõikumisi, asetades viigipuu kontrollitud keskkonda, näiteks garaaži, kus temperatuur jääb veidi külmumise ja veidi üle. Taime tuleks joota, kui pinnas kuivab.<br/><br/>Varjestus<br/><br/>Puude kaitsmiseks äärmuslike talviste ilmastikutingimuste eest on vaja kilpe. Viigipuud vajavad paigutamist pinnase piirkondadesse, kus muld ei külmuta, et kaitsta seda haiguste eest ja suurendada selle talvel ellujäämise võimalusi. Puu ümber paigutatud suured ekraanid kaitsevad seda talvetuulte eest, mis võivad puitu kahjustada ja külmutada.<br/><br/>Pakendamine<br/><br/>Puu mähkimine kaitseb puu külma ilmaga ja takistab kõvade tuulte hävitamist oksad. Viigipuu mähkimist tuleks rakendada, kui puu lehed on langenud, et vältida lehtede mädanemist mähkimismaterjali sees. Viigipuud on tundlikud kergete temperatuurimuutuste suhtes. See ei saa soojeneda kaitsekile sees või muidu võib puu hakata kasvama, muutes selle külma löögi ajal tõsiseks kahjustuseks.<br/><br/>Istutamine<br/><br/>Kultiveerimistavad aitavad kaitsta viigipuu karmidel talvedel. Külma ilmaga vastupidavad sordid on parimad kohtades, kus ilmastikutingimused on karmid. Pruun kalkun, Brunswick ja Blue Celeste on külma ilmaga head sordid. Istutamine peaks toimuma vastu seina või struktuuri, mis kiirgab talvekuudel soojust puu poole.<br/><br/>Lumi<br/><br/>Viigipuu juured vajavad talve puhkeperioodil kuiva pinnast. Kastmist tuleks teha ainult siis, kui muld on kuiv ja juured tuleks kaitsta lume ja vihma sulamise eest. Kaitse, mis on paigutatud maapinnale puu all, pagasiruumi lähedale - et hoida vett pinnasesse voolamast - kaitseb puud kahjustuste eest.<br/><br/>Märksõnad:<br/>viigipuu kaitse, viigipuu talv, viigipuu hooldus |
| Oculus CEO comes down hard on Mac support for the Rift<br/><br/>Oculus CEO, Palmer Luckey, has not minced his words when asked in an interview whether the Rift VR headset will ever support the Mac. If you had any hopes of it being soon, you might want to ready yourselves for some disappointment.<br/><br/>That is up to Apple. If they ever release a good computer, we will do it.<br/><br/>What he's referring to there in a less diplomatic sense is the discrete graphics required to run the Rift. The simple truth is that Apple just doesn't go for high-end graphics that will meet the requirements for the headset. For context, on a Windows PC, you need a minimum of an NVIDIA GTX 970, a $300 graphics card.<br/><br/>As Luckey went on to say:<br/><br/>It just boils down to the fact that Apple doesn't prioritize high-end GPUs. You can buy a $6,000 Mac Pro with the top of the line AMD FirePro D700, and it still doesn't match our recommended specs. So if they prioritize higher-end GPUs like they used to for a while back in the day, we'd love to support Mac. But right now, there's just not a single machine out there that supports it.<br/><br/>The Mac Pro can't be accused of not packing plenty of horsepower, because it does, but equally FirePro graphics are targeted more towards the creative market, just like the Mac Pro. The Mac Pro in particular far exceeds other hardware requirements, but naturally as the Rift is graphics heavy, this is where the shortfall is. Luckey is perhaps being a little over the top, but equally he's the man behind the Rift, so there's no doubts plenty of truth to what he says. Even if he doesn't say it particularly well.<br/><br/>What say you, Mac owners of the world? Are you even bothered about the Oculus Rift or is it something you wish you could have? Sound off in the comments below!<br/><br/>Reader comments<br/><br/>Oculus CEO comes down hard on Mac support for the Rift<br/><br/>No, not bothered by it since I really wasn't planning on buying an Oculus Rift. For me the product category is still too early and too much in a beta-kinda phase. But he does rise a valid point. Apple should try to get more ahead of the pack CPU/GPU wise. Right now they're always trailing behind.<br/><br/>Excuse me, but what is HTC Vive better at? And Oculus Rift most certainly supports Linux machines that meet their hardware specifications! (The issue is not OS but hardware.)<br/><br/>Also, look at WHY the HTC Vive supports OS X: it includes more of its own hardware. (Which is why it costs so much.) The Oculus solutions - both the Rift and the Samsung Gear VR - require the hardware that it is plugging into to perform more of the heavy lifting.<br/><br/>VR isn't a gimmick. 3D TVs don't always give that much of a 3d effect, and it doesn't work with everyone. VR works with everyone, and the Oculus and HTC Vive official release products have almost no latency so there shoudn't be any motion sickness. There's also plenty of game support<br/><br/>Obviously if gaming is a priority you're generally not in the market for a Mac, though. Not many game developers support OSX so these types of devices likely have limited use on a Mac (for gaming, anyways, which the Rift was designed for). At least that's the only reason I could see myself using one. I definitely wouldn't use it for watching movies.<br/><br/>Apple did implement the Metal engine into El Capitan, there might be some plan to go into the gaming market (as Apple learned from iOS how big this market is, just look at the top grossing apps).<br/>So now the hardware is missing and and game devs would probably show some interest, since Macs there are now an acceptable amount of Mac users around the world.<br/><br/>I would like to see Apple make its way into that sector of the industry. I don't use any Apple products presently but they're making a lot of the right moves in many areas and I'm very intrigued.<br/><br/>Plus, competition fuels innovation. I know that major computer part manufactures already create that competition but Apple has the RnD willpower and the cash to really turn heads. They may not win the numbers games in terms of specs, they actually rarely do, but most people who care to do the research know that performance != the sum of the device's parts. Apple can do more with "less". On paper their products appear inferior but when carefully balanced hardware meets specifically engineered software they generally perform just as well as the competition if not out perform.<br/><br/>HA! I love how, all of a sudden, having a high performance computer is not important to Apple phans! There is not a single Mac capable of the highest end graphics. Can't buy one, can't build one. Mac is not capable of being the highest in performance and you are good with that. HA! Classic!<br/><br/>I bought my MacBook Pro Retina in 2012 because of the high resolution screen and the non-discrete GPU. However, for my desktop I built a system with a 4K monitor, i7 4790K CPU, 3 GTX 970 GPU's, and 16 gb of memory all for less than what I'd pay for an iMac. I even have an SSD set up to boot in OSX. My point is Apple could do similar things if it wished, but doesn't. In fact, look at the most recent iMac. It includes discrete graphics and a slow 5400 RPM drive. My computer may not look as pretty, and it's not as thin, but in the end it's more useful - isn't that why we buy a computer in the first place?<br/><br/>I don't see why a Mac pro can not make use of the Oculus isn't it built for rendering video. I understand that it will not be able to run on iMac's and because of this the Oculus should be branded for Pro users due to the requirements and come at the price.<br/><br/>Now people are saying that your computer is doing ALL the heavy lifting, so why is the price point over $800 for something that isn't doing anything?<br/><br/>I'm excited about the direction of VR but not where it is at the moment.<br/><br/>Your display (which the Rift is) never does any of the heavy lifting. It's $800 because of what the display does; 110° viewing angle (still not human eye but much closer than other displays) with super low latency to reduce or eliminate motion sickness on a 1200x1800 per eye display for HD quality.<br/><br/>And yes, Mac's are very widely used for video rendering, but that rendering doesn't happen at 30+fps. It can take video rendering machines hours to render a single frame and sometimes years to render an entire movie. The final products, or pre-rendered material, is what then becomes 30+fps.<br/><br/>Thank you @TheRealFixxer<br/>Alot of what you say makes sense and some I was unaware of.<br/><br/>I guess I don't see VR as a game, but as an immersion and seeing Mac's are good at 3dcad and compiling video I would think they would be able to compile a scene well. I've even seen 3d renders of movie walk through. Creating a 3d world and placing cameras in areas to figure out how a scene would look<br/><br/>But I agree Mac's make more use of CPU cycles even by using there GPU's to help. WIth that said there are other directions one could take it. Like external thunderbolt video cards.<br/><br/>My big grip is the fact Octulas is looked at as a consumer product. If the requirements are that high, then it's more a pro product and needs to be advertized as that. I understand the technology is there but don't feel it's there to call it a consumer product.<br/><br/>Yes, you are right. Apple also has issues with software. Most aren't using "metal" the apple programming language which speeds up the processing for games because it's an Apple only solution where many use game engines that work on Microsoft Direct X or open source Opengl which most games use to run on Linux and oSX. Opengl is around 20% slower and sometime a lot more than that compared to direct x so a top of the line gaming card running in oSX runs as fast is a mid level gaming card in windows. So big problems not to mention most macs have built in cards that have no upgradability.<br/><br/>The mac pro is so different that Apple would have to do this as it wouldn't be worth a card vendor doing this as there is no profit in it for them with the small amount of possible buyers there would be for this. Apple doesn't like to loose money so I don't see this ever happening. Apple would loose money offering video card upgrades for mac pros.<br/><br/>Well he has a point though I do t care about oculus rift, rather wait for starVR. There should be an option to add better GPUs into an iMac and MacBook Pro. It is also sad that there is no more nVidia card, I liked the CUDA support now I will have to buy a PC and install Linux for my CUDA projects.<br/><br/>Gaming is a growing market and it won't be long until even iPhones have more GPU performance than the Macs. I agree that Apple should offer a high end GPU in a Mac<br/><br/>I am very bothered by the lack of high performance discrete graphics on Mac computers. Even the top of the like iMac uses an out of date mobile GPU which, of course, cannot be upgraded. If I want to develop software for VR, Apple has left me no choice but to buy or build a PC to run it on. As a big Apple fan (yes I admit it) this make me rather sad.<br/><br/>BTW, VR is not some passing fad. If you have tried it you know what I mean. VR is going to change gaming and content creation forever. My only worry about VR is that is too good. There could be millions of people that will become addicted to living and playing in virtual worlds. Look at how many people got addicted to MMOs that played on a flat screen. With VR you really feel like you are in the game.<br/><br/>Not worried about anything, i am pretty sure apple will have its own implementation for Mac and iOS when tech will be ready for consumers, right now it is more for hardcore users. Like always apple like to time its presence on right time, with right product. Have faith in apple.<br/><br/>It's funny that a lot of people know which vr is better based on os support. I guess you guys did heavy testing and now are the guy in the big electronic store that knows best.<br/><br/>HTC said it will bring support to the osx but that still needs to be seen.<br/><br/>I understand that a lot of you guys are stamped on there d**ks. But understand that Apple is more focused on laptops. And laptops can't be packed with more power than a PC, due to size, heat, power consumption etc.<br/><br/>He is right, even though he put it in **** terms. I love my Mac but Lord it needs a boost in graphics. Not that it needs to cost more but I would be more than willing to pay a little extra for a better graphics card or at least have the option to install my own. It's really too bad this guy had to make his statement sound like he is just plain uneducated. | Oculus tegevjuht tuleb raske Mac toetust Rift<br/><br/>Oculuse tegevjuht Palmer Luckey ei ole oma sõnu intervjuus küsinud, kas Rift VR-peakomplekt toetab kunagi Maci. Kui teil oli lootusi, et see on varsti, võiksite end mõne pettumuse jaoks ette valmistada.<br/><br/>See sõltub Apple'ist. Kui nad kunagi hea arvuti vabastavad, siis me teeme seda.<br/><br/>Mida ta viitab seal vähem diplomaatilises mõttes on diskreetne graafika vaja käivitada Rift. Lihtne tõde on see, et Apple lihtsalt ei lähe high-end graafika, mis vastab nõuetele peakomplekt. Konteksti jaoks on Windowsi arvutis vaja vähemalt NVIDIA GTX 970, 300-dollarine graafikakaart.<br/><br/>Nagu Luckey ütles:<br/><br/>See lihtsalt taandub asjaolule, et Apple ei sea prioriteediks tipptasemel GPU-sid. Saate osta $ 6,000 Mac Pro koos AMD FirePro D700-ga, ja see ei vasta endiselt meie soovitatud spetsifikatsioonidele. Nii et kui nad seavad prioriteediks kõrgema taseme GPU-d, nagu nad mõnda aega varem kasutasid, siis tahaksime Maci toetada. Aga praegu pole seal lihtsalt ühtegi masinat, mis seda toetaks.<br/><br/>Mac Pro-d ei saa süüdistada, et see ei pakkinud palju hobujõudu, sest see teeb, kuid samamoodi FirePro graafika on suunatud rohkem loomingulisele turule, nagu Mac Pro. Eriti Mac Pro ületab kaugelt muud riistvaranõuded, kuid loomulikult on Rift graafika raske, see on koht, kus puudujääk on. Luckey on võib-olla veidi ülekaalus, aga ta on samavõrra mees Rifti taga, nii et pole kahtlust, et ta räägib palju tõtt, isegi kui ta seda eriti hästi ei ütle.<br/><br/>Mida te ütlete, Maci maailma omanikud? Kas olete isegi mures Oculus Rifti pärast või kas see on midagi, mida soovite, et teil oleks? Alltoodud kommentaarides on heli välja lülitatud!<br/><br/>Lugeja kommentaarid<br/><br/>Oculus tegevjuht tuleb raske Mac toetust Rift<br/><br/>Ei, seda ei häiri see, sest ma tõesti ei plaaninud Oculus Rifti ostmist. Minu jaoks on tootekategooria ikka veel liiga vara ja liiga palju beeta-kinda faasis. Kuid ta tõstab kehtivat punkti. Apple peaks proovima pakki CPU / GPU-st kaugemale jõuda. Praegu jäävad nad alati tagaplaanile.<br/><br/>Vabandust, kuid mis on HTC parem elada? Ja Oculus Rift kindlasti toetab Linuxi masinaid, mis vastavad nende riistvara spetsifikatsioonidele! (Küsimus ei ole OS, vaid riistvara.)<br/><br/>Samuti vaadake, miks HTC Vive toetab OS X: see sisaldab rohkem oma riistvara. (See on põhjus, miks see maksab nii palju.) Oculuse lahendused - nii Rift kui ka Samsung Gear VR - vajavad riistvara, mida see ühendab, et teha rohkem rasket tõstmist.<br/><br/>VR ei ole trikk. 3D-telerid ei anna alati nii palju 3D-efekti ja see ei tööta kõigiga. VR töötab kõigiga ja Oculus ja HTC Vive ametlikel väljalasketoodetel ei ole peaaegu mingit latentsust, nii et ei tohiks olla mingit liikumishaigust. Seal on ka palju mängu toetust<br/><br/>Ilmselt, kui mängimine on prioriteet, siis üldiselt ei ole Maci turul. Mitte paljud mänguarendajad ei toeta OSX-i, nii et seda tüüpi seadmetel on tõenäoliselt piiratud kasutamine Macis (mängude jaoks, mida Rift oli mõeldud). Vähemalt see on ainus põhjus, miks ma nägin ennast seda kasutamas. Ma kindlasti ei kasutaks seda filmide vaatamiseks.<br/><br/>Apple ei rakendanud metallimootorit El Capitanile, võib olla mõni plaan mänguturule minna (nagu Apple õppis iOS-ist, kui suur see turg on, vaadake lihtsalt top brutorakendusi).<br/>Nii et nüüd on riistvara puudu ja mängude arendajad ilmselt näitaksid huvi, kuna Macid on nüüd kogu maailmas vastuvõetav kogus Maci kasutajaid.<br/><br/>Tahaksin näha, kuidas Apple jõuab sellesse tööstuse sektorisse. Ma ei kasuta praegu ühtegi Apple'i toodet, kuid nad teevad paljudes valdkondades palju õigeid liigutusi ja ma olen väga intrigeeriv.<br/><br/>Ma tean, et suured arvutiosad juba loovad seda konkurentsi, kuid Apple'il on RnD tahtejõud ja raha, et tõesti päid pöörata. Nad ei pruugi võita numbrite mänge spetsifikatsioonide poolest, nad tegelikult harva teevad, kuid enamik inimesi, kes hoolivad uurimistööst, teavad, et jõudlus ! = seadme osade summa. Apple saab rohkem teha "vähem". Paberil nende tooted tunduvad halvemad, kuid kui hoolikalt tasakaalustatud riistvara vastab spetsiaalselt konstrueeritud tarkvarale, täidavad nad üldiselt sama hästi kui konkurendid, kui nad ei täida.<br/><br/>HA! Ma armastan, kuidas äkki, millel on suure jõudlusega arvuti ei ole oluline Apple fans! Ei ole ühtegi Mac võimeline kõrgeima lõpp-graafika. Ei saa osta üks, ei saa ehitada üks. Mac ei ole võimeline olema kõrgeim jõudlus ja sa oled hea, et. HA! Klassikaline!<br/><br/>Ostsin oma MacBook Pro Retina 2012. aastal kõrge resolutsiooniga ekraani ja mittediskreetse graafikaprotsessori tõttu. Kuid oma töölauale ehitasin 4K monitori, i7 4790K CPU, 3 GTX 970 GPU ja 16 GB mälu kõik vähem kui ma maksaksin iMaci eest. Mul on isegi OSX-is käivitamiseks seadistatud SSD. Minu mõte on see, et Apple võiks sarnaseid asju teha, kui ta soovis, kuid mitte. Tegelikult vaadake viimast iMaci. See sisaldab diskreetset graafikat ja aeglast 5400 RPM-i draivi. Minu arvuti ei pruugi välja näha nii ilus, ja see ei ole nii õhuke, kuid lõpuks on see kasulikum - kas pole see, et me ostame arvuti esiteks?<br/><br/>Ma ei näe, miks Mac pro ei saa kasutada Oculus ei ole ehitatud renderdamiseks video. Ma saan aru, et see ei saa käivitada iMac ja seetõttu Oculus peaks olema kaubamärgiga Pro kasutajatele tõttu nõuded ja tulevad hinnaga.<br/><br/>Nüüd inimesed ütlevad, et teie arvuti teeb KÕIK rasket tõstmist, nii et miks on hind üle $ 800 midagi, mis ei tee midagi?<br/><br/>Ma olen põnevil VR-i suunas, kuid mitte selles, kus see praegu on.<br/><br/>Teie ekraan (mis on Rift) ei tee kunagi rasket tõstmist. See on 800 dollarit, sest ekraan teeb; 110 ° vaatenurk (veel mitte inimsilm, kuid palju lähemal kui teised ekraanid) super madala latentsusega, et vähendada või kõrvaldada merehaigust 1200x1800 silmaekraani kohta HD-kvaliteediga.<br/><br/>Ja jah, Maci kasutatakse väga laialdaselt video renderdamiseks, kuid see renderdamine ei toimu 30 + kaadrit sekundis. Ühe kaadri renderdamiseks võib kuluda tunde ja mõnikord terve filmi renderdamiseks aastaid. Lõpptooted või eelnevalt renditud materjal on see, mis muutub seejärel 30 + fps-iks.<br/><br/>Täname @TheRealFixxer<br/>Paljudel asjadel on mõtet ja osadel, millest ma ei teadnud.<br/><br/>Ma arvan, et ma ei näe VR-i mänguna, kuid sukeldumiseks ja Maci nägemiseks on 3dcad ja video koostamisel head, arvan, et nad suudaksid stseeni hästi kompileerida. Olen isegi näinud filmi 3d-i rendereid. 3D-maailma loomine ja kaamerate paigutamine piirkondadesse, et välja selgitada, kuidas stseen välja näeks<br/><br/>Kuid ma nõustun, et Mac kasutab rohkem CPU tsükleid isegi siis, kui kasutate GPU-sid, et aidata. Mis ütles, et on ka teisi suundi, mida võiks seda võtta. Nagu välised äikesepildi videokaardid.<br/><br/>Minu suur haare on see, et Octulast peetakse tarbekaubaks. Kui nõuded on nii kõrged, siis on see rohkem pro toode ja seda tuleb reklaamida. Ma saan aru, et tehnoloogia on olemas, kuid ärge tundke, et see on olemas, et seda nimetada tarbekaubaks.<br/><br/>Jah, teil on õigus. Apple'il on probleeme ka tarkvaraga. Enamik ei kasuta "metalli" õuna programmeerimiskeelt, mis kiirendab mängude töötlemist, sest see on Apple'i ainus lahendus, kus paljud kasutavad mängumootoreid, mis töötavad Microsoft Direct X-is või avatud lähtekoodiga Opengl-is, mida enamik mänge kasutab Linuxis ja oSX-is. Opengl on umbes 20% aeglasem ja mõnikord palju rohkem kui otsene x, nii et oSX-is töötav mängukaardi tipp töötab nii kiiresti kui keskmise taseme mängukaart Windowsis. Nii suured probleemid, rääkimata sellest, et enamik Mac-e on sisse ehitatud kaartidesse, millel ei ole uuendatavust.<br/><br/>Mac pro on nii erinev, et Apple peaks seda tegema, sest see ei oleks väärt kaardi müüja seda teha, sest seal ei ole kasumit neile väike kogus võimalikke ostjaid oleks seda. Apple ei meeldi kaotada raha, nii et ma ei näe seda kunagi juhtuda. Apple kaotaks raha, pakkudes videokaardi uuendusi mac plusse.<br/><br/>Noh, tal on punkt, kuigi ma ei hooli oculus riftist, pigem oodake starVR-i. Peaks olema võimalus lisada paremaid GPU-sid iMaci ja MacBook Pro-sse. Samuti on kurb, et enam ei ole nVidia kaarti, mulle meeldis CUDA tugi nüüd pean ostma arvuti ja installima Linuxi minu CUDA projektidele.<br/><br/>Mäng on kasvav turg ja see ei võta kaua aega, kuni isegi iPhone'idel on rohkem GPU jõudlust kui Mac-il. Nõustun, et Apple peaks Mac-is pakkuma kõrgekvaliteedilist GPU-d<br/><br/>Ma olen väga häiritud suure jõudlusega diskreetse graafika puudumisest Mac-arvutites. Isegi iMaci ülemine osa kasutab aegunud mobiilset GPU-d, mida muidugi ei saa uuendada. Kui ma tahan arendada tarkvara VR, Apple ei jätnud mulle muud valikut kui osta või ehitada arvuti käivitada. Nagu suur Apple fänn (jah ma tunnistan seda) see teeb mind üsna kurb.<br/><br/>BTW, VR ei ole mingi mööduv mood. Kui olete seda proovinud, siis teate, mida ma mõtlen. VR muudab mängu ja sisu loomist igavesti. Minu ainus mure VR-i pärast on see liiga hea. Seal võib olla miljoneid inimesi, kes muutuvad sõltuvuses elavad ja mängivad virtuaalses maailmas. Vaata, kui palju inimesi sai sõltuvuses MMOs, mis mängis lameekraanil. VR sa tõesti tunned, nagu sa oled mängus.<br/><br/>Ma ei muretse midagi, ma olen üsna kindel, et Apple'il on oma rakendus Maci ja iOS-i jaoks, kui tehnoloogia on tarbijatele valmis, praegu on see rohkem hardcore kasutajatele. Nagu alati, meeldib õun oma kohalolekut õigel ajal õige tootega ajastada. Uskuge õuna.<br/><br/>Naljakas on see, et paljud inimesed teavad, milline vr on parem OS-i toel. Ma arvan, et te tegite rasket testimist ja nüüd on see mees suures elektroonilises poes, kes teab kõige paremini.<br/><br/>HTC ütles, et see toob toetust osx, kuid see on veel näha.<br/><br/>Ma saan aru, et paljud teist on tembeldatud seal d**ks. Aga mõista, et Apple on rohkem keskendunud sülearvutid. Ja sülearvutid ei saa pakitud rohkem võimu kui PC, sest suurus, soojus, energiatarbimine jne<br/><br/>Ta on õige, kuigi ta pani selle **** tingimustel. Ma armastan oma Mac kuid Issand see vajab tõuke graafika. Mitte, et see peaks maksma rohkem, kuid ma oleks rohkem kui valmis maksma natuke ekstra parema graafikakaardi või vähemalt on võimalus installida oma. See on tõesti halb, et see mees pidi oma avalduse heli nagu ta on lihtsalt harimatu. |
| The Masjid in the American Landscape: Civic Rights<br/><br/>Twelfth graders examine and explain legal rights designed to protect religious liberty. They evaluate the extent to which the First Amendment protects religious practices. They research and describe current and past legal battles over religious zoning and buildings. They discuss whether restrictions should be placed on where religious buildings are built.<br/><br/>What Members Say<br/><br/>As an online high school teacher, LP has helped me tremendously with extra resources! I have been able to use additional supplemental materials from here and students are able to gain more knowledge and a different perspective. | Masjid Ameerika maastikul: kodanikuõigused<br/><br/>Kaheteistkümnenda klassi õpilased uurivad ja selgitavad usuvabaduse kaitsmiseks mõeldud seaduslikke õigusi. Nad hindavad, mil määral esimene parandus kaitseb religioosseid tavasid. Nad uurivad ja kirjeldavad praeguseid ja varasemaid õiguslikke lahinguid religioosse tsoneerimise ja hoonete üle. Nad arutavad, kas tuleks seada piiranguid religioossete hoonete ehitamisele.<br/><br/>Mida parlamendiliikmed ütlevad<br/><br/>Online keskkooli õpetajana on LP aidanud mind tohutult lisaressurssidega! Olen suutnud kasutada täiendavaid lisamaterjale siit ja õpilased saavad rohkem teadmisi ja teistsugust perspektiivi. |
| What Guys Said 19<br/><br/>No, it is because entertainment producers and product marketers want actors/actresses and models who look like the majority of the audience, so that they are relatable and therefore more effective sales tools. I am sure that Asian women look wonderful to Asian men. To me, as a white man, they have zero appeal.<br/><br/>@cowboy101 I am 100 per cent straight. I do not go outside of my race. When I was a soldier I had the "me love you long time" experience in Asia. That has left me feeling uncomfortable whenever there are Asian females near me. Sometimes I become profoundly uncomfortable, even though the particular individuals have done nothing to merit it. During a visit to Thailand, I found that the only way to prevent myself being propositioned on the street was to take white a female with me as a minder.<br/><br/>Aha the thing is that there isn't many white people (or any at all) in China, but in 'white' places, (or at least Australia) there are quite a lot of Asians around there, which made me think about this question...<br/><br/>Maybe in parts of the country where you stick at (remember, birds of a feather...), just like to republicans it seems that most people are republican etc. While it can only be small minority that you are surrounded by.<br/><br/>And as far as I know, there are a lot of whites in china, mainly by business, etc. But it's simple, most of people there are Asian, so they prefere Asian girls (dogs like dogs , cats like cats, most people prefere their own kind). And there is nothing wrong with that. Same is in white countries.<br/><br/>I think Asians are the most beautful. Unfortunately for me the 2 I got involved with in my life one was using me for my place/internet a long time ago and the recent one was a gold digging stupid bitch. She never graduated college and was 30. I would be extremely happy if I met a smart cute Asian woman near my age that was not a gold digger.<br/><br/>@Prettyapathetic yes because when a man loves deeply he always good with you on bed no matter size of tits or colour of skin and a real man always respect a girl in every relation like mother, sister, wife, girlfriend etc<br/><br/>as a model from childhood I got my start with a company called sugar & spice. I was recruited in Japan while my family was stationed there.<br/><br/>you get a job because they are going for a certain look, who are they targeting, and the area you live in.<br/><br/>I had to leave the industry last year because of health reasons. I worked with with many types of people, korean, Japanese, chinese, polish, german, American, Spanish, arabic. I've worked with children, adults, teenagers all of these ethnicities.<br/><br/>I am half white half Native American (Lakota) so they loved my look from a young age. but there are many beauty standards in the industry and not all of them are as portrayed, some being made to look worse, and some not taken seriously enough...<br/><br/>Nope, it's because the Asian men are jealous and angry and invent thousands of excuses every rare time who have Asian women in the media because they are jealous of Asian women, and Americans want to keep the status of white women, this is why the couples between Asian women and white men are boycotted and all other race with white women are pushed, it's white women wiht white men and white women with other races in American media, since it's opression and offensive for the ego of men of other race the women of own race with white but white women with other race is "anti-racism". You need to understand the American political social engineering all over these years of media, democrats, politics and propaganda.<br/><br/>Anyway, in countries like china, japan, korea they have Asian men and Asian women only and the only exceptions are when they import a white women to make some fantasy scene for them but it's not so much, it's forbiden expose the hatred and jealousy of some Asian men.<br/><br/>The Asian boys will be happy if you say something against other men, but they will be angry if you say that the Asian girl will die for the blond girl date the handsome caucasian/white dude, they will try to force Asian women to make anything against these men to these small vocal group of Asian men feel better in their hatred, excuses, racism and jealousy. This is why Asian women is not showed so much, it's because the Asian men will be angry, it's because the white women can't be replaced, and the American propaganda is around white women with white men, white women with other race, white women against white men for the other race of men, white women in everything.<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>1&#124;0<br/><br/>0&#124;0<br/><br/>Opinion Owner<br/><br/>1mo<br/><br/>All the excuses of media and propaganda and all lies for racism, jealousy and hate aren't used against white women by the same men who invent the excuses, white women all the time in the media, understand, the American social engineering is made by democrats, democrats hate white men, and the most popular couples would be white men and Asian women but it's horrible for a few group of white racists who are racists even against Asians, is bad for the angry Asian men and their excuses, is bad for the white women, the democrats really don't like white men and work hard to try to make the couple and anything wiht white men and non-white women be related to bad things while pushing white women and non-white men. It's a American political problem.<br/><br/>I think it's a opression against the ego of the men of other race, so the white guys need to look bad, be some sort of jokes, be soft, while the scenes with white women and other race is the opposite of the scenes of white men and non-white women | Mida poisid ütlesid 19<br/><br/>Ei, see on sellepärast, et meelelahutustootjad ja tooteturustajad tahavad näitlejaid / näitlejaid ja mudeleid, kes näevad välja nagu enamik publikut, nii et nad on relatable ja seega tõhusamad müügivahendid. Ma olen kindel, et Aasia naised näevad suurepärased Aasia mehed. Minu kui valge mees, nad on null kaebuse.<br/><br/>@cowboy101 Ma olen 100% sirge. Ma ei lähe väljaspool oma rassi. Kui ma olin sõdur mul oli "mina armastan sind pikka aega" kogemus Aasias. See on jätnud mind ebamugavalt, kui on Aasia naised minu lähedal. Mõnikord tunnen end väga ebamugavalt, isegi kui konkreetsed inimesed ei ole midagi teinud, et seda väärida. Külaskäigul Taisse avastasin, et ainuke viis, kuidas ennast tänaval ette panna, oli võtta valge naine endaga kaasa kui alaealine.<br/><br/>Aha asi on selles, et Hiinas ei ole palju valgeid inimesi (või üldse mitte), kuid "valgetes" kohtades (või vähemalt Austraalias) on seal üsna palju aasialasi, mis pani mind sellele küsimusele mõtlema...<br/><br/>Võib-olla mõnes riigis, kus sa kinni (pea meeles, linnud sulgi...), just nagu vabariiklased tundub, et enamik inimesi on vabariiklased jne Kuigi see võib olla ainult väike vähemus, et sa oled ümbritsetud.<br/><br/>Ja niipalju kui ma tean, on Hiinas palju valgeid, peamiselt äri jne. Kuid see on lihtne, enamik inimesi on Aasias, nii et nad eelistavad Aasia tüdrukuid (koerad nagu koerad , kassid nagu kassid, enamik inimesi eelistavad oma liiki). Ja selles pole midagi valesti. Sama kehtib valgetes riikides.<br/><br/>Ma arvan, et Aasia on kõige ilusam. Kahjuks minu jaoks 2 sain kaasatud minu elu üks kasutas mind minu koht / internet kaua aega tagasi ja hiljutine oli kuld kaevamine loll lits. Ta ei ole kunagi lõpetanud kolledži ja oli 30. Ma oleksin väga õnnelik, kui ma kohtasin tark armas Aasia naine lähedal minu vanus, mis ei olnud kuld kaevaja.<br/><br/>@Prettyapathetic jah, sest kui mees armastab sügavalt, on ta alati sinuga voodis hea, olenemata tisside suurusest või nahavärvist, ja tõeline mees austab alati tüdrukut igas suhtes nagu ema, õde, naine, tüdruksõber jne<br/><br/>Mudelina alustasin lapsepõlvest ettevõttega Sugar & Spice. Mind värvati Jaapanis, kui mu pere oli seal.<br/><br/>Sa saad töö, sest nad lähevad teatud ilme, kes nad on suunatud, ja ala, kus sa elad.<br/><br/>Ma pidin eelmisel aastal tööstusest lahkuma tervislikel põhjustel. Töötasin paljude inimestega, korea, jaapani, hiina, poola, saksa, ameerika, hispaania, araabia. Olen töötanud laste, täiskasvanute, teismeliste kõigi nende etniliste rühmadega.<br/><br/>Ma olen pool valge pool Native American (Lakota), nii et nad armastasid minu välimust noorest east. kuid tööstuses on palju ilustandardeid ja mitte kõik neist ei ole nii kujutatud, mõned on tehtud halvemaks ja mõned ei ole piisavalt tõsiselt võetud...<br/><br/>Ei, see on, sest Aasia mehed on armukade ja vihane ja leiutada tuhandeid vabandusi iga harva, kes on Aasia naised meedias, sest nad on armukade Aasia naised, ja ameeriklased tahavad säilitada staatuse valged naised, see on põhjus, miks paarid Aasia naised ja valged mehed on boikoteeritud ja kõik muud rassi valged naised on surutud, see on valged naised avatud valged mehed ja valged naised teiste rasside Ameerika meedia, sest see o Sa pead mõistma Ameerika poliitilist sotsiaalset inseneri kogu nende aastate jooksul meedia, demokraatide, poliitika ja propaganda.<br/><br/>Igatahes, riikides nagu Hiina, Jaapan, Korea on Aasia mehed ja Aasia naised ainult ja ainus erand on, kui nad impordivad valge naiste teha mõned fantaasia stseen neile, kuid see ei ole nii palju, see on keelatud paljastada viha ja armukadedus mõned Aasia mehed.<br/><br/>Aasia poisid on õnnelikud, kui sa ütled midagi teiste meeste vastu, kuid nad on vihased, kui sa ütled, et Aasia tüdruk sureb blond tüdruk kuupäev ilus kaukaasia/valge kutt, nad püüavad sundida Aasia naised midagi vastu need mehed, et need väikesed vokaalne rühm Aasia mehed tunnevad paremini oma viha, vabandusi, rassismi ja armukadedus. Sellepärast Aasia naised ei näidata nii palju, see on, sest Aasia mehed on vihane, see on, sest valged naised ei saa asendada, ja Ameerika propaganda on umbes valged naised valged mehed, valged naised teise rassi, valged naised vastu valged mehed teise rassi mehed, valged naised kõik.<br/><br/>1 .<br/><br/>1&#124;0<br/><br/>0&#124;0<br/><br/>Arvamuse omanik<br/><br/>1mo<br/><br/>Kõik valged mehed valged vabandused ja propaganda ja kõik valed rassismi, armukadedus ja vihkamine ei kasuta valgete naiste vastu samad mehed, kes leiutavad vabandusi, valged naised kogu aeg meedias, mõista, Ameerika sotsiaalne insener on teinud demokraadid, demokraadid vihkavad valged mehed ja kõige populaarsem paarid oleks valged mehed ja Aasia naised, kuid see on kohutav mõned valge rassistid, kes on rassistid isegi Aasia vastu. See on Ameerika poliitiline probleem.<br/><br/>Ma arvan, et see on rõhumine teise rassi meeste ego vastu, nii et valged mehed peavad nägema halvad välja, olema mingid naljad, olema pehmed, samas kui stseenid valgete naiste ja teiste rassidega on vastupidised valgete meeste ja mitte-valgete naiste stseenidele. |
