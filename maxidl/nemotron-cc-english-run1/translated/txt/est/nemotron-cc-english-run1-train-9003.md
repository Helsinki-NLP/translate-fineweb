| The Masterpiece: a Chain Poetry Challenge<br/><br/>John has been writing poetry since his school days. He was awarded the "Best Poet 2014 and 2021" Hubby Awards.<br/><br/>Madame Monet in a Japanese kimono, 1875<br/><br/>Claude Monet [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>A Brief History of Collaborative, Collective, or Chain Poetry<br/><br/>Collaborative,collective, or chain poetry is an alternative and creative technique for writing poetry by more than one person. The principal aim of this type of poetry is to create poems through the collaboration of various authors/poets, trying to form a unified voice while still maintain their individual voices.<br/><br/>Examples of collaboration abound in Japanese poetry. Though the precise accounts and records of many such events are either lost or missing.<br/><br/>One of the most famous examples of collective poetry writing was the poem collection titled Ralentir Travaux by Surrealist French poets André Breton, Paul Éluard and René Char. These three poets collaborated to write the poems in this collection over just five days in 1930.<br/><br/>During the 1940s, Charles Henri Ford, an American poet, invented what he called the "chain poem", where each poet wrote a line and then sent the poem to another person (to continue) in another part of the world, by post.<br/><br/>In 2007 a collection of American collaborative poetry Saints of Hysteria: A Half-Century of Collaborative American Poetry was edited and published by Denise Duhamel, Maureen Seaton and David Trinidad.<br/><br/>Collaborative poetry writing has been used in schools and colleges to teach students teamwork and to discover ways in which they are connected.(source: Wikipedia)<br/><br/>Study of a Figure Outdoors: Woman with a Parasol, facing left, 1886<br/><br/>Claude Monet [Public domain or Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>The Aim of This Article and How to Approach the Challenge<br/><br/>A few years back I wrote an article called "Poem Without an End" which included a Christmas poem I had written that lent itself to being added to. I was amazed by the response as at that stage I only had a few followers here. People wrote a stanza of poetry each in "comments" on the hub to follow on from the previous commenter's stanza. It worked out very well and at the end I compiled all the contributions into a single poem as part of the hub.<br/><br/>Similar challenges have been issued since, including one by Frank Atanacio called "Spirits Sat as Mourners" that was also very successful. The difference being that in that instance contributors wrote their own hubs for their stanza of poetry and placed a link on Frank's original hub.<br/><br/>For this particular challenge I don't expect everyone to spend valuable time writing separate hubs for one stanza of poetry (unless you really want to). The main problem being that to make it effective you would have to copy the previously written parts of the poem onto your hub and would probably be hit with "duplication" label.<br/><br/>So, that being the case, and also to save having to leave links everywhere, I just ask that anyone who wants to take part just write their stanza here in "comments." Check the last comment before yours that is contributing to the challenge and follow on. If I see more than one following from the same stanza I will use my poetic licence to work them in as I deem best.<br/><br/>At some stage when I feel there has been enough stanzas added I will probably call an end to the challenge and then compile them all together as the completed poem as part of the article (also giving credit to each contributor).<br/><br/>Flowered Riverbank, Argenteuil<br/><br/>Claude Monet [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>The Challenge!<br/><br/>Now comes the interesting part. If you join this chain poetry challenge you have to try to keep the style and voice of the poem as close as possible to the preceding verses, so that to uninformed readers it will appear that only one author has written the entire poem.<br/><br/>Sounds easy, you say? Well maybe it would be if the poem had a traditional style, rhyme or meter. But this one doesn't! The poem you will be adding to was started by an acquaintance of mine Andriealphus as a "chain poem challenge" elsewhere. At the time of writing I was the only other person who had accepted the challenge, and because I loved the subject I thought it would be a great challenge for my fellow writers and decided to use it here and see if the response would be better. (I know of a few poets here whose writing would suit this style)<br/><br/>Rules :<br/><br/>Follow on from the previous stanza in comments<br/><br/>Try to retain the voice and style of the poem<br/><br/>Keep your stanza/verse to approximately the same length as those before<br/><br/>Claude Monet was one of the most famous painters in the history of art and a leading figure in the Impressionist movement.<br/><br/>In 1883 Monet moved to Giverny. Here, he loved to paint outdoors in the gardens that he helped create. The water lilies found in the pond had a particular appeal, and he painted several series of them throughout the rest of his life; the Japanese-style bridge over the pond became the subject of several works, as well.<br/><br/>In 1912 Monet painted a series of 12 waterlily paintings commissioned by the Orangerie des Tuileries, a museum in Paris. He chose to make them on a very large scale, and to serve as a "haven of peaceful meditation." This project consumed much of Monet's later years. Monet once stated, "These landscapes of water and reflection have become an obsession for me. It is beyond my strength as an old man, and yet I want to render what I feel."<br/><br/>His health was now an obstacle, as well. Nearly blind, with both of his eyes seriously affected by cataracts, Monet finally agreed to undergo surgery for the ailment in 1923.<br/><br/>Monet's famous water lilies turned redder as his cataracts progressed. After getting corrective surgery he destroyed most of the "red lily" paintings, angry that no one really mentioned it to him. Ironically, these paintings were probably what made his impressionistic style so famous in that time -- artists started taking more risks with color and such during this point. (source: biography.com)<br/><br/>The Masterpiece<br/><br/>"The boy sitting behind you says you look like a masterpiece.<br/><br/>Ask him, has he ever seen a Monet up close?<br/><br/>Close enough to see nothing but muddled strokes of weedy lakeshore?<br/><br/>Close enough to dip his fingers into the ridges<br/><br/>where oil paints hardened under an artist's gaze?<br/><br/>Close enough to breathe onto the blood lilies?<br/><br/>Ask him, why did he paint them red?" (Andriealphus)<br/><br/>He grinned like Carroll's cheshire cat.<br/><br/>"Through clouded and bloodshot eyes I imagine.<br/><br/>Be my waterlilies!" he says,<br/><br/>"Feel my breath and let my fingers delve,<br/><br/>become my masterpiece instead.<br/><br/>A brush has never touched a canvas as fine as your fair skin.<br/><br/>Let the masters weep in jealousy,<br/><br/>and Van Gogh slice his ear in envy at the beauty of your nakedness."(Jodah)<br/><br/>Self portrait with bandaged ear<br/><br/>Vincent van Gogh [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>Responses<br/><br/>Now it's your turn. Please write your response in the comments below, remembering to check those immediately before yours for the last written stanza of the poem. If you do decide to write a separate hub for your stanza of verse, make sure you leave a link here in comments.<br/><br/>The Finished Masterpiece<br/><br/>All contributions have been received and I have put the finished poem together with only some slight edits. I hope everyone is happy with the result. If you think I could improve the order of stanzas etc, feel free to let me know.<br/><br/>Comments<br/><br/>Hey Diana, looks like I have to go add another stanza to the finished poem :)<br/><br/>Thanks for this contribution.Quite beautiful.<br/><br/>Diana L Pierce from Potter County, Pa. on September 19, 2015:<br/><br/>No tears splash water below,<br/><br/>From the bridge beneath his feet,<br/><br/>Nor can his brush paint his thoughts,<br/><br/>From the mystery maid he seeks.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 21, 2015:<br/><br/>Thank you Cris, I am sure everyone appreciates your comment.

And the beauty we can still enjoy today from all his work.<br/><br/>This is a great challenge! I am really looking forward to adding to this.<br/><br/>I first wanted to stop in and let you know that, up for sure. Shared too.<br/><br/>And thank you so much for all the challenges to help the rest of us, keep our mental energy flowing and giving it a work out! You are the best.<br/><br/>The information about LuLu and the free ISBN number is an answered prayer! So, smile my friend. You are a gift!<br/><br/>Hugs. :-)<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 12, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi again Marj. I think I may have all the verses that are going to come. I have been doing my best to arrange them as I think best with just a little editing. I will probably post the finished poem as a separate hub with a link on this one to it. My book is available on Lulu and iBooks...there's a link on one of the earlier comments. I'd really appreciate it if you were to purhase a copy. Bear in mind it's my first eBook so the formatting etc isn't perfect, but it's taken me seven revisions I think to get it where it is. It will all be easier next time. If you need help let me know.<br/><br/>travmaj from australia on August 12, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi John, you have certainly had some excellent responses to your challenge - I'm sure you'll fuse it altogether beautifully although I imagine a difficult task. I'm interested in your poetry books also - I really have to get my act together technologically - I'll try and check it all out...cheers -<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi Jo, both books 'On the Wings of Eagles" and "I Laughed a Smile" have mostly the same content...except the former has one extra poem. Originally they were in different formats, one ePub, the other PDF but now they are both ePub. They are available through Lulu and iBooks, soon Barnes and Noble and Nook (not Amazon). I may try publishing another book through Amazon soon just to see how it compares. Thanks again.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>John, thanks a lot, the info on publishing with Lulu will be quite useful as I'm thinking of publishing but I'm currently torn between Amazon and Lulu. I wanted to purchase one of your books, but I couldn't seem to find them on Amazon. However, I'll probably get it from Lulu. Wishing you every success, you deserve it.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Hey Phyllis, thanks for ontributing. I like it, a perfect ending to the poem I think.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks Faith.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi Jo, I think I have sorted out the poem satisfactorily. Just waiting to see if there is any more to add. Publishing with Lulu wasn't bad and now that I've done it once it will be easier next time. Getting the formatting to look right in the eBook was the hardest, though you and just type it in a word document and Lulu automatically produces the contents page and converts the document to ePub or PDF you can only use certain fonts and have to make sure the chapter names or poem titles are in Heading 1. They also provide a free ISBN number if you want. Overall it was easier than expected however.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Phyllis, this is succinct and beautiful, I love it. Shyron's did an excellent job also, I thought I'd already commented on her verse, but I hadn't.<br/><br/>Phyllis Doyle Burns from High desert of Nevada. on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Wonderful hub, great idea, Jodah. Here is one from me. Short but sweet. Hope it is okay:<br/><br/>And this the beauty be<br/><br/>From Masters past we see<br/><br/>Impressed upon the boy<br/><br/>Bestowed on her with joy<br/><br/>Faith Reaper from southern USA on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks John and Jo. You are kind. Jo, you have always been a brilliant poet. I, too, am looking forward to the end result after John does his magic to pull it all together.<br/><br/>I will share again to see if there are any more takers.<br/><br/>Blessings<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Faith, beautifully done, I find it incredible how someone with such limited vision can teach us so much about beauty, light and shadows. John, looking forward to reading the end result.<br/><br/>By the way, congtats on publishing your poems. How did you find the process of publishing with Lulu?<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks for your great submission Faith. No it's not too late, I'm still compiling the final poem so it should be up for all to see in a day or two.<br/><br/>Faith Reaper from southern USA on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi John,<br/><br/>I apologize for my late submission here to your wonderful challenge. I am off from work a couple of day and decided to give this a go while my husband is resting from knee surgery. If it does not meet with your standards, please feel free to not use it in your final poem or edit as you deem necessary.<br/><br/>Blessings always<br/><br/>Here it goes:<br/><br/>Confessions to friend Georges Clemenceau<br/><br/>Of light encapsulating both torment, joy<br/><br/>Fervent madness in analyzing colors<br/><br/>Consequential spontaneous creations<br/><br/>Season after season of obsession<br/><br/>Capturing different hues in a single moment<br/><br/>Attentive while strolling in Argenteuill<br/><br/>Brushwork bares masterpiece.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 09, 2015:<br/><br/>Just a shout out to see if anyone else still wants to contribute to this chain poem.

Thanks to all who have contributed.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 02, 2015:<br/><br/>Thank you Genna. It appears Monet is a favourite arist of many here. I hope you'll take part in this challenge too :)<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 02, 2015:<br/><br/>Thank you for a great contribution Shyron. This is a very nice verse. Well done.<br/><br/>Genna East from Massachusetts, USA on August 02, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi John...<br/><br/>I started to read this wonderful challenge (Monet is one of my favorite artists), then came back to finish reading some of the beautiful contributions that give this painting a stunning voice through perception and the senses.

I'm so glad you like my contribution. This is a very good idea, I know you'll have fun putting it all together. Take care and my best to you.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks Deb, yes I am impressed by the standard of submissions. I'm looking forward to putting it all together.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Yes Ann, it is good to see the poets among us take up the challenge with some great contributions so far. I just hope Imcan do it justice when it comes to putting it together.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Well done Jo. The word "sublime" comes to mind. I hoped all the poets would rise to the fore, and they have. Love it, thanks for contributing.<br/><br/>Deb Hirt from Stillwater, OK on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>I am excited to see what you end up with here. There are a number of fine poets rising to the challenge, so go to it!<br/><br/>Ann Carr from SW England on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Great one, Jo!<br/><br/>You've got everyone going, John! Rather you than me, putting all this together, but it's going to be a humdinger of a poem when it finally comes to an end - if it ever does! You've really started something.<br/><br/>Ann<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Ok, John here goes nothing! Following from Kim's. I hope it reads well.<br/><br/>And the boy began to walk away<br/><br/>But in his wake, I heard him say<br/><br/>"I took a trip to Orangerie<br/><br/>Where the ghost of Monet still abides<br/><br/>I sat right down and gazed awhile<br/><br/>Until I heard a soft voice cry.<br/><br/>"Have you ever seen a fluid dream?<br/><br/>Where light evolves into what it touch<br/><br/>Where serenity flows through cloudy veil<br/><br/>Where the magician's brush like lightening rush<br/><br/>Have you ever seen a sight sublime?<br/><br/>A child born of distorted illusion<br/><br/>This flowering pond that traps the light<br/><br/>That lift the heart and beckons the soul<br/><br/>An abstract pulchritude up close<br/><br/>Move back, behold; such tranquil delight."<br/><br/>I hope this is in line with what the others have done.

Anyone is welcome to do more than one stanza. I may add another myself at some stage.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>John, I've decided to have a go, but it's about 16 lines, can I do it in two stanzas following on from Kim's wonderful submission? You can always edit it later.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on July 31, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi Jo, sorry to hear you are under the weather at the moment. I am not in a hurry to close this challenge so I'll keep it open until you are back firing on all cylinders and are able to contribute. You are one of the hubbers I was looking forward to getting a response from as I thought it would suit. Thank you for your kind words, and get well soon.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on July 31, 2015:<br/><br/>Wow! John I can't believe I almost missed your incredible challenged. This is something in which I would have loved to participate since Claude Monet is one of my all times favourite artist. Unfortunately, I must cry off. I'm a bit under the weather with a head full of cotton wool, or so it seems. If the challenge is still open when I get rid of this pesky flu I may give it a go, but I must say, the standard is exceptionally high. Maj took it to another level but all the submissions are brilliant. Kudos to you Andriealphus and the other writers who participated so far in this artistic and creative masterpiece.<br/><br/>My best always Jo.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on July 31, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi again Maj, glad this poem inspired you, and yes it beats watching the cricket especially with the Aussie batsmen performing badly in this third test. It will be an interesting exercise for me to fuse all the stanzas together but should be good.<br/><br/>travmaj from australia on July 30, 2015:<br/><br/>John, thank you, I'm most happy you like my offering. I found the poem intriguing and suddenly felt inspired to write my version in the same mode. I'm not sure I wrote a continuation from the stanza before (alwaysexploring) but I'm sure you will fuse it altogether when the time comes. Love all the responses. I haven't managed any creative writing for yonks, can't wait now to start over, just need some time. (beats watching the cricket too!!!) Cheers John, will be checking in -<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on July 30, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks for checking Dana. I am pleased with the quality of responses so far. I just have to wait and see how many more come in. The final,poem should be great.<br/><br/>Dana Tate from LOS ANGELES on July 30, 2015:<br/><br/>Just checking in to see how things are going, I can't wait for the finished product.

Seda tüüpi luule peamine eesmärk on luua luuletusi erinevate autorite / luuletajate koostöö kaudu, püüdes moodustada ühtset häält, säilitades samal ajal nende individuaalsed hääled.<br/><br/>Näiteid koostöö külluses Jaapani luule. Kuigi täpsed aruanded ja ülestähendused paljud sellised sündmused on kas kadunud või puudu.<br/><br/>Üks kuulsamaid näiteid kollektiivse luule kirjutamisest oli sürrealistlike prantsuse luuletajate André Bretoni, Paul Éluardi ja René Chari luuletus "Ralentir Travaux". Need kolm luuletajat tegid koostööd, et kirjutada luuletusi selles kollektsioonis vaid viie päeva jooksul 1930. aastal.<br/><br/>1940. aastatel leiutas Ameerika luuletaja Charles Henri Ford, mida ta nimetas "ahela luuletuseks", kus iga luuletaja kirjutas rea ja saatis seejärel luuletuse teisele inimesele (jätkamiseks) teises maailma osas posti teel.<br/><br/>2007. aastal toimetasid ja avaldasid Denise Duhamel, Maureen Seaton ja David Trinidad Ameerika koostööl põhineva luule kogumiku "Pühad hüsteeriast: koostööl põhineva Ameerika luule pool sajandit".<br/><br/>Koolides ja kolledžites on kasutatud koostööl põhinevat luule kirjutamist, et õpetada õpilastele meeskonnatööd ja avastada viise, kuidas nad on ühendatud.

Olin hämmastunud vastusest, sest sellel etapil oli mul siin ainult mõned järgijad. Inimesed kirjutasid luule stanza iga "kommentaarides" sõlmpunktis, et järgida eelmise kommentaatori stanza. See töötas väga hästi ja lõpuks koostasin kõik panused ühte luuletusse sõlmpunkti osana.<br/><br/>Sellest ajast alates on välja antud sarnaseid väljakutseid, sealhulgas Frank Atanacio "Vaimud istuvad kui leinajad", mis oli ka väga edukas. Erinevus on see, et sel juhul kaastöötajad kirjutas oma hubs oma stanza luule ja panna link Frank originaal hub.<br/><br/>Selle konkreetse väljakutse jaoks ei oota ma, et igaüks kulutaks väärtuslikku aega, kirjutades eraldi sõlmpunktid ühe luule stanza jaoks (kui sa tõesti tahad). Peamine probleem on see, et selle tõhusaks muutmiseks peate kopeerima luuletuse varem kirjutatud osad oma keskusesse ja tõenäoliselt tabab seda "dubleerimise" sildiga.<br/><br/>Nii et kui see on nii, ja ka säästa võttes jättes lingid kõikjal, ma lihtsalt palun, et igaüks, kes tahab osaleda lihtsalt kirjutada oma stanza siin "kommentaarid". Kontrollige viimase kommentaari ees oma, mis aitab kaasa väljakutse ja järgige. Kui ma näen rohkem kui ühte järgijat samast stanzast, siis ma kasutan oma poeetilist litsentsi, et töötada nendega nii, nagu ma parimaks pean.<br/><br/>Mingil hetkel, kui ma tunnen, et on lisatud piisavalt stanzasid, kutsun ma tõenäoliselt väljakutse lõppu ja seejärel koostan need kõik artikli osana valmis luuletusena (ka igale kaastöötajale).<br/><br/>Lilleline jõeäär, Argenteuil<br/><br/>Claude Monet [avalik domeen], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>Väljakutse!<br/><br/>Nüüd tuleb huvitav osa. Kui liitute selle ahelluule väljakutsega, peate püüdma hoida luuletuse stiili ja häält võimalikult lähedal eelmistele värssidele, nii et informeerimata lugejatele tundub, et ainult üks autor on kirjutanud kogu luuletuse.<br/><br/>Kõlab lihtne, sa ütled? Noh, võib-olla oleks see, kui luuletusel oleks traditsiooniline stiil, riim või meeter. Aga see ei ole! Luuletus, mida te lisate, alustas minu tuttav Andreialphus kui "ahela luuletus väljakutse" mujal. Kirjutamise ajal olin ma ainus teine inimene, kes oli väljakutse vastu võtnud, ja kuna ma armastasin teemat, arvasin, et see oleks minu kaaskirjutajatele suur väljakutse ja otsustasin seda siin kasutada ja näha, kas vastus oleks parem. (Ma tean siin mõnda luuletajat, kelle kirjutamine sobiks sellele stiilile)<br/><br/>Reeglid:<br/><br/>Järgige eelmise stanza kommentaarides<br/><br/>Püüdke säilitada luuletuse hääl ja stiil<br/><br/>Hoidke oma stanza / tagurpidi umbes sama pikk kui enne<br/><br/>Claude Monet oli üks kuulsamaid maalijaid kunstiajaloos ja juhtiv tegelane impressionistlikus liikumises.<br/><br/>1883. aastal kolis Monet Givernysse, kus ta armastas maalida õues aedades, mida ta aitas luua. Tiigis leiduvatel liiliatel oli eriline apellatsioon ja ta maalis neid kogu ülejäänud elu jooksul mitu seeriat; Jaapani stiilis sild üle tiigi sai ka mitmete tööde teemaks.<br/><br/>Aastal 1912 Monet maalitud rida 12 veeroos maalid tellitud Orangerie des Tuileries, muuseum Pariisis. Ta otsustas teha neid väga suures mastaabis, ja olla "sadamas rahumeelne meditatsioon." See projekt tarbis palju Monet'i hilisemaid aastaid. Monet ütles kord: "Need vee ja peegelduse maastikud on muutunud minu kinnisideeks. See ületab minu tugevust vana mehena, ja siiski tahan ma seda, mida ma tunnen."<br/><br/>Tema tervis oli nüüd ka takistuseks. Peaaegu pime, mõlemad silmad olid kataraktist tõsiselt mõjutatud, nõustus Monet lõpuks 1923. aastal haiguse kirurgiaga.<br/><br/>Monet'i kuulsad liiliad muutusid punasemaks, kui tema kataraktid edenesid. Pärast parandusoperatsiooni hävitas ta enamiku "punase liilia" maalidest, vihane, et keegi teda tegelikult ei maininud. Irooniline, need maalid olid ilmselt see, mis tegi tema impressionistliku stiili nii kuulsaks - kunstnikud hakkasid selle aja jooksul võtma rohkem riske värvide ja sellistega. (allikas: biography.com)<br/><br/>Meistriteos<br/><br/>"Poiss, kes istub su selja taga, ütleb, et sa näed välja nagu meistriteos.<br/><br/>Küsige temalt, kas ta on kunagi Monet'i lähedal näinud?<br/><br/>Piisavalt lähedal, et näha vaid umbrohtude järve kallast?<br/><br/>Piisavalt lähedal, et ta sõrmed kasta.<br/><br/>kus õlivärvid kunstniku pilgu all kõvenesid?<br/><br/>Piisavalt lähedal, et hingata verelillede peale?<br/><br/>Küsige temalt, miks ta need punaseks värvis?"

| First of all EEQT itself needs to be further developed in order to provide a theoretical and computational answer to the needs of modern quantum engineering<br/>and technology. We need to include classical systems with infinite<br/>numbers of degrees of freedom - like electromagnetic and/or gravitational<br/>field. We also need to include infinite quantum systems so as<br/>to understand and simulate Bose gas and its phase transitions. But, there<br/>are also steps that must be taken far beyond the paradigm of EEQT.<br/>As we have emphasized so many times: quantum theory has yet<br/>to be understood in terms of a "non-linear classical theory." But what we mean by a "classical theory" is something much more advanced and more<br/>general than clasical mechanics or classical field theory. By a "classical theory" we mean first of all, a theory that is not based<br/>on probabilities from the start; a theory in which probabilities appear at a<br/>later stage, derived from the theory; derived perhaps, in a necessary way. Such a theory must not only specify the mathematical objects and their relations but also make "predictions".<br/>A classical theory is, in particular, a theory in which discrete events can happen, events that are "objective." They may be events that affect mainly the physical stratum, but they may be also "mental<br/>events," changes of states of "consciousness;" whatever they are, even if they<br/>are concerned with branchings of universes, - they DO HAPPEN.<br/>Such a theory, encompassing the quantum theory as we know it today,<br/>does not yet exist, but we can envisage its possible shape. Nothing serves better than an example, so let us give here an example of how<br/>such a theory can be construed.<br/>Imagine a theory developed a'la Einstein's unified field theory, but<br/>with variable metric signature, possibly with a complex causal web, multiple<br/>Einstein-Rosen [40] (see also [41]) bridges,<br/>time loops, nondifferrentiability, fractal structure, all of that additionally complicated by variable dimensionality of space and of "time" (cf [42]. Imagine such a theory to be able to accomodate all the four fundamental<br/>forces known to us, but it also involves an extra field, which is different<br/>from physical fields, and which is non-local in the sense that it does not<br/>survive taking a macro-average-limit when causal space-time<br/>structure of Einstein's general relativity is recovered. This extra field<br/>would be a place for "thought forms" and our theory would couple these<br/>thought forms to more "physical" levels of reality. The very concept of<br/>"time" would arise only in one particular limiting structure. Nothing<br/>prevents a theory of such a type to have mathematical structures rich enough to accomodate consciousness and mind. Due to its complexity,<br/>density of time-loops, bubble-like causal structure, making predictions<br/>in such theory is possible only by applying probability -<br/>as it is the case with systems evolving according to deterministic<br/>but chaotic dynamics. Quantum wave function would emerge in such a<br/>theory as an effective way of predicting. That type of explanation<br/>of quantum indeterminism was postulated long ago by I. J. Good. In<br/>[3] he speculated that<br/>quantum indeterminism can be understood if we admit that individual quantum events that actually happen here and now have future<br/>advanced causes as well has past retarded causes.<br/>A glimpse of such a thought<br/>may have occured to Alan Turing when he wrote his famous, already quoted sentence: "prediction must be linear, description must be nonlinear."<br/>A theory going partially in this direction is being developed by L. Nottale<br/>[43] who states the observation, attributed to Feynman, that "the typical paths of quantum mechanical particles are continuous non-differentiable." Then he continues his development of fractal<br/>space-time ideas to conclude with: "The quantum behavior becomes, in this theory,<br/>a manifestation of the fractal geometry of space-time, in the same way gravitation is, in Einstein's theory of general (motion-)relativity, a manifestation of the curvature of space-time.<br/>Another step in this direction comes from the work of Russian scientists - which started with the most original ideas of N.A. Kozyrev [44]<br/>and A. Sakharov [45], and is being developed in Moscow, the Urals and Siberia, see e.g. [46, 47, 48]. | Esiteks tuleb EEQTd edasi arendada, et anda teoreetiline ja arvutuslik vastus kaasaegse kvanttehnoloogia ja -tehnoloogia vajadustele. Me peame hõlmama klassikalisi süsteeme, millel on lõpmatu arv vabadusastmeid - nagu elektromagnetiline ja / või gravitatsiooniväli. Samuti peame hõlmama lõpmatuid kvantsüsteeme, et mõista ja simuleerida Bose gaasi ja selle faasisiirdeid. Kuid on ka samme, mida tuleb võtta palju kaugemale EEQD paradigmast.<br/>Nagu me oleme nii palju kordi rõhutanud: kvantteooriat ei ole veel mõistetud "mittelineaarse klassikalise teooria" mõistes. Kuid see, mida me mõtleme "klassikalise teooria" all, on midagi palju arenenumat ja üldisemat kui klassikaline mehaanika või klassikalise välja teooria. "Klassikalise teooria" all mõtleme kõigepealt teooriat, mis ei põhine algusest peale tõenäosustel; teooriat, kus tõenäosused ilmnevad hilisemas etapis, tuletatud teooriast; võib-olla tuletatud vajalikul viisil. Selline teooria ei pea mitte ainult täpsustama matemaatilisi objekte ja nende suhteid, vaid ka tegema "ennustusi".<br/>Klassikaline teooria on eelkõige teooria, kus diskreetsed sündmused võivad juhtuda, sündmused, mis on "objektiivsed". Need võivad olla sündmused, mis mõjutavad peamiselt füüsilist kihti, kuid need võivad olla ka "vaimsed sündmused", "teadvuse" olekute muutused; mis iganes nad on, isegi kui nad on seotud universumite harudega - nad juhtuvad.<br/>Sellist teooriat, mis hõlmab kvantteooriat, nagu me seda täna teame, ei ole veel olemas, kuid me võime ette kujutada selle võimalikku vormi. Miski ei ole parem kui näide, nii et andkem siin näide sellest, kuidas sellist teooriat saab tõlgendada.<br/>Kujutage ette, et teooria töötas välja Einsteini ühtse väljateooria, kuid muutuva meetrilise allkirjaga, võib-olla keerulise põhjusliku veebiga, mitmekordselt.<br/>Einstein-Rosen [40] (vt ka [41]) sillad, ajasilmused, mittediferentseeritavus, fraktaalne struktuur, kõik see veelgi keerulisem ruumi ja "aja" muutuva dimensiooniga (vt [42]). Kujutage ette sellist teooriat, mis suudaks sobitada kõiki meile teadaolevaid nelja fundamentaalset jõudu, kuid see hõlmab ka täiendavat välja, mis erineb füüsilistest väljadest ja mis on mittelokaalne selles mõttes, et see ei jää ellu, võttes makro-keskmise piiri, kui Einsteini üldise relatiivsusteooria põhjuslik ruum-aja struktuur taastub. See lisaväli oleks koht "mõtlemisvormidele" ja meie teooria siduks need mõttevormid reaalsuse "füüsilisematele" tasanditele.<br/>"aeg" tekiks ainult ühes konkreetses piiravas struktuuris. Miski ei takista sellist tüüpi teoorial olema matemaatilisi struktuure, mis on piisavalt rikkad, et mahutada teadvust ja meelt. Tänu oma keerukusele, tihedus ajasilmusi, mull-like põhjuslik struktuur, tehes ennustused selline teooria on võimalik ainult kohaldades tõenäosus -<br/>kui see on nii süsteemidega, mis arenevad vastavalt deterministlikule, kuid kaootilisele dünaamikale. Kvantlaine funktsioon tekiks sellises teoorias tõhusa ennustamise viisina. Seda tüüpi selgitus kvant-indeterminism oli postuleeritud ammu I. J. Good. In<br/>[3] Ta spekuleeris, et kvant-indeterminismi saab mõista, kui me tunnistame, et individuaalsed kvant-sündmused, mis tegelikult toimuvad siin ja millel on nüüd ka tulevased edasijõudnud põhjused, on minevikus aeglustunud põhjused.<br/>Alan Turing kirjutas oma kuulsa, juba tsiteeritud lause: "ennustus peab olema lineaarne, kirjeldus peab olema mittelineaarne."<br/>Teooria, mis läheb osaliselt selles suunas, on välja töötatud L. Nottale'i poolt.<br/>[43] kes väidab Feynmanile omistatud tähelepanekut, et "kvantmehaaniliste osakeste tüüpilised teed on pidevad diferentseerimatud". Seejärel jätkab ta oma fraktaalse ruumi-aja ideede arendamist, lõpetades: "Kvantkäitumine muutub selles teoorias ruumi-aja fraktaalse geomeetria manifestatsiooniks, nii nagu Einsteini üldise (liikumise) relatiivsuse teoorias on gravitatsioon ruumi-aja kõveruse manifestatsioon.<br/>Teine samm selles suunas pärineb Vene teadlaste tööst - mis algas N.A. Kozyrevi kõige originaalsemate ideedega [44]<br/>ja A. Sahharoviga [45] ning seda arendatakse Moskvas, Uuralites ja Siberis, vt nt [46, 47, 48]. |
| Best Nutrition And Exercise For Lose Weight<br/><br/>How is breakfast really healthy?<br/><br/>In the morning like an emperor, at noon like a king, in the evening like a beggar – goes a well-known proverb. A study by the medical organization Endocrine Society confirms the key message behind the saying: It shows that breakfast plays a more important role than is often assumed. In the morning, the human body actually has more than twice as high a metabolic activity as at other times of the day: A large breakfast not only keeps you full for a long time, blood sugar and insulin levels also rise slowly. The appetite for sweets is regulated, we eat snacks less often during the day. Therefore, breakfast should not be skipped even during a diet.<br/><br/>Of course, having a big breakfast doesn't mean that we should have several croissants with nut nougat cream and sweet breakfast pancakes in the morning. Breakfast is healthy best when it is high in protein and fiber, as well as providing vitamins and minerals. Whole grain bread or muesli, oat flakes, fruits and nuts are energy suppliers that are good for you and keep you full for a long time.<br/><br/>The fact that a large breakfast is better than a large dinner does not necessarily mean that breakfast is essential for losing weight. A meta-analysis carried out in 2019 showed, that the total daily energy intake of people who eat breakfast is on average higher, than that of those who do not have breakfast. The latter were on average just under half a kilo lighter. So, according to the results of this major study, you don't necessarily have to eat breakfast if you want to lose weight.<br/><br/>Lose weight with the right diet – that's how easy it is to put healthy on your plate<br/><br/>Eating healthy in no way means less taste. Fresh vegetables, fish or meat as protein sources and other healthy ingredients conjure up taste in the pot and a smile on your lips – ideally also when you step on the scales. A US study has shown that people who cook their own food and consciously deal with what they eat have a body mass index in the normal range. Restaurant visits or fast food, on the other hand, quickly lure you into the sugar trap: Often there is no indication of how much sugar is in salad dressings, how much fat the potatoes were fried in or whether the meat was not treated.<br/><br/>A healthy lunch consists of three parts – the largest part is fruits or vegetables and should cover half of the plate. A quarter of the meal should consist of protein, i.e. fish, meat or tofu. The remaining quarter consists of carbohydrates and is ideally made from whole grain products. Important: Don't eat at your desk in the office, but stimulate your metabolism and ideally take a short walk before or after lunch.<br/><br/>When should you eat to lose weight?<br/><br/>In the evening, you should focus on light meals that are rather low in carbohydrates. These are the least likely to cause insulin to skyrocket, which is good for our body. Vegetables, dairy products and nuts, for example, are well suited for this.<br/><br/>You should also be careful not to have dinner too late. It is best to have eaten until 7 p.m. – then the body can relax and prepare for the night. Sufficient sleep is important for healthy weight loss. A US study found that people who slept about eight hours a night had better fat deposits. So good night! Allow yourself more than six hours of sleep so that you can start the next day fit and refreshed.<br/><br/>Losing weight without exercise – is it really possible?<br/><br/>It would be so easy, if the dream weight could be achieved simply by lowering the calorie intake. But you probably know the wisdom that diet is only one side of the coin and exercise is the other. So nothing helps: Put on your sportswear and off you go!<br/><br/>Anyone who, in addition to the sports program such as jogging, walking or swimming, also lets the elevator go alone and takes the stairs, takes a little detour or uses the bike instead of the car, is doing wellis also called something good. Even simple walking is good for health. | Parim Toitumine Ja Harjutus Kaalulangus<br/><br/>Kuidas on hommikusöök tervislik?<br/><br/>Hommikul nagu keiser, keskpäeval nagu kuningas, õhtul nagu kerjus – see on tuntud vanasõna. Meditsiinilise organisatsiooni Endokriinsüsteemi Seltsi uuring kinnitab ütluse põhisõnumit: See näitab, et hommikusöögil on olulisem roll kui sageli eeldatakse. Hommikul on inimkehal tegelikult rohkem kui kaks korda kõrgem metaboolne aktiivsus kui teistel päevadel: suur hommikusöök mitte ainult ei hoia teid pikka aega täis, veresuhkru ja insuliini tase tõuseb ka aeglaselt. Söögiisu maiustustele on reguleeritud, me sööme suupisteid päeva jooksul harvemini. Seetõttu ei tohiks hommikusööki vahele jätta isegi dieedi ajal.<br/><br/>Muidugi, võttes suur hommikusöök ei tähenda, et meil peaks olema mitu croissants pähkli nugat koor ja magus hommikusöök pannkoogid hommikul. Hommikusöök on tervislik, kui see on kõrge valgu ja kiudaineid, samuti pakkudes vitamiine ja mineraalaineid. Terve teravilja leib või müsli, kaerahelbed, puuviljad ja pähklid on energia tarnijad, mis on hea teile ja hoiab teid täis pikka aega.<br/><br/>Asjaolu, et suur hommikusöök on parem kui suur õhtusöök, ei tähenda tingimata, et hommikusöök on kehakaalu langetamiseks hädavajalik. 2019. aastal läbi viidud metaanalüüs näitas, et hommikusööki söövate inimeste päevane energiatarbimine on keskmiselt kõrgem kui hommikusööki mittesöövatel inimestel. Viimased olid keskmiselt veidi alla poole kilo kergemad. Nii et vastavalt selle suure uuringu tulemustele ei pea te tingimata hommikusööki sööma, kui soovite kaalust alla võtta.<br/><br/>Kaotada kaalu õige toitumine – see on, kui lihtne on panna terve taldrikule<br/><br/>Tervislik toitumine ei tähenda mingil juhul vähem maitset. Värsked köögiviljad, kala või liha kui valguallikad ja muud tervislikud koostisosad kutsuvad esile poti maitse ja naeratuse huultel - ideaaljuhul ka kaalul astudes. USA uuring on näidanud, et inimestel, kes küpsetavad oma toitu ja tegelevad teadlikult sellega, mida nad söövad, on kehamassiindeks normaalses vahemikus. Restoranide külastused või kiirtoit meelitavad teid suhkrupüünisesse: sageli ei ole märke sellest, kui palju suhkrut on salatikastmetes, kui palju rasva kartulid praetud või kas liha ei töödeldud.<br/><br/>Tervislik lõunasöök koosneb kolmest osast - suurim osa on puuviljad või köögiviljad ja peaks katma poole taldrikust. Veerand toidust peaks koosnema proteiinist, st kalast, lihast või tofust. Ülejäänud kvartal koosneb süsivesikutest ja on ideaaljuhul valmistatud täisteratoodetest. Oluline: Ärge sööge oma laua taga kontoris, vaid stimuleerige oma ainevahetust ja ideaaljuhul tehke lühike jalutuskäik enne või pärast lõunat.<br/><br/>Millal peaks sööma, et kaalust alla võtta?<br/><br/>Õhtul peaksite keskenduma kergetele toitudele, mis on üsna madalad süsivesikutes. Need on kõige vähem tõenäolised, et põhjustada insuliini tõusu, mis on meie keha jaoks hea. Näiteks köögiviljad, piimatooted ja pähklid sobivad selleks hästi.<br/><br/>Samuti peaksite olema ettevaatlik, et mitte süüa õhtusööki liiga hilja. Parim on süüa kuni 19:00 – siis saab keha lõõgastuda ja valmistuda ööks. Piisav uni on oluline tervisliku kehakaalu langetamiseks. USA uuringus leiti, et inimesed, kes magasid umbes kaheksa tundi öösel oli parem rasva ladestumist. Nii head ööd! Lubage endale rohkem kui kuus tundi magada, nii et saate alustada järgmisel päeval sobivad ja värskendatud.<br/><br/>Kaalu kaotamine ilma treeninguta - kas see on tõesti võimalik?<br/><br/>Oleks nii lihtne, kui unistus kaalu võiks saavutada lihtsalt vähendades kalorite tarbimist. Aga sa ilmselt tead tarkust, et toitumine on ainult üks pool mündi ja kasutamise on teine. Nii et miski ei aita: Pane oma spordirõivad ja ära minna!<br/><br/>Igaüks, kes lisaks spordiprogrammile, nagu sörkimine, kõndimine või ujumine, laseb ka liftil üksi minna ja võtab trepid, võtab väikese ümbersõidu või kasutab auto asemel jalgrattaid, teeb hästi ka midagi head. Isegi lihtne jalutuskäik on tervisele kasulik. |
| Why We Open Sourced the Anvil App Server<br/><br/>Why Open Source?<br/><br/>A little while ago, we open-sourced the Anvil App Server. The community reaction has been great, even a little overwhelming (yes, every reply to that announcement really did land in my inbox!). We've already incorporated a bunch of that feedback into our version 1.2 release. But we keep getting asked, " Why did you open-source such a core part of your product? "<br/><br/>Why do this at all?<br/><br/>Anvil is a tool that makes it as simple as possible to build a web app. We do that by enabling you to build the whole application in one language, Python.<br/><br/>Simple hosting is part of that.<br/><br/>The web platform is broken , and Anvil is our attempt to fix it. And, because there is so much complexity in deploying a web app, a cloud-hosted service was the best way to provide the simplicity we want. That way, you can build your app in the Anvil Editor, and make it live on the Internet with one click.<br/><br/>But we kept hearing from people who said, "that's great, but…"<br/><br/>"…but I need to run this on an offshore platform without reliable internet access"<br/><br/>"…but I want to package my app into an IoT device I sell"<br/><br/>or simply, "…but if I'm putting my eggs in this basket, how can I be sure I can still run my app in ten years' time?"<br/><br/>These are all good points! A cloud service isn't the right solution for everyone. If we want to serve these users, there's got to be some way for them to get their apps out of Anvil and run them locally, under their own complete control.<br/><br/>Open Source: Escape hatch, not an ejector seat<br/><br/>We believe in escape hatches, not ejector seats. At conferences, we sometimes get asked, "can I export this as a Flask+JS app?". Sure, it would be possible – we could generate a server package, compile the client-side Python to Javascript, and spit out a classic web app. But it would have serious drawbacks, because:<br/><br/>Not a comfy ride.<br/><br/>Code generation is an ejector seat. Generated code is better than nothing – at least you can edit it! But the moment you edit that code, you lose all the benefits of the system that generated it. If you're using Anvil because of its drag-and-drop editor and Python in the browser, why should our locally-hosted users have to use vim and Javascript?<br/><br/>So we did it the right way: we open-sourced Anvil's runtime engine. It's the same code that serves your app in our hosted service, and it represents your app the same way. You can edit your code with a text editor, run it, then git push it back into our online IDE. It's not an ejector seat: there's no explosive transition. It's an escape hatch: you can climb out, and climb right back in.<br/><br/>What about our business model?<br/><br/>Anvil was never meant to be one of those enterprise low-code systems that charge you $20/mo for each person who uses your app. Anvil is a developer tool. The apps you develop are yours. Enabling you to run them on a Raspberry Pi is cool, but it doesn't change our business model.<br/><br/>We're doing what we always were: We make and sell a development tool that makes it drastically simpler to build web applications. We provide hosting for Anvil apps. We offer the entire development-and-hosting platform on-site for enterprise customers. And, of course, we offer a free plan so that everyone can use Anvil for hobby or educational purposes – or to start building something and see how it goes.<br/><br/>We've open-sourced the Anvil App Server for the (relatively small) number of people who need it, and to provide the ultimate insurance policy. Sure, you can build an app with vim and host it yourself, without even registering an account with us (we've got docs to show you how!). But the Anvil Editor is the world's easiest way to build a web app, and our hosted service is the easiest way to deploy it – so that's what we expect most of our users to continue doing. And you can build with confidence, knowing that the open-source code is right there if you need it.<br/><br/>Try it yourself<br/><br/>If our development philosophy resonates with you, why not try Anvil yourself? | Miks me avasime Anvil App Serveri lähtekoodi<br/><br/>Miks avatud lähtekoodiga?<br/><br/>Veidi aega tagasi avasime Anvil App Serveri. Kogukonna reaktsioon on olnud suurepärane, isegi natuke ülekaalukas (jah, iga vastus sellele teadaandele tõesti jõudis minu postkasti!). Oleme juba lisanud hulga sellest tagasisidest meie versiooni 1.2 väljalaskesse. Kuid meilt küsitakse pidevalt: "Miks sa avasid oma toote sellise põhiosa? "<br/><br/>Miks te seda üldse teete?<br/><br/>Anvil on tööriist, mis muudab veebirakenduse ehitamise võimalikult lihtsaks. Me teeme seda, võimaldades teil kogu rakenduse ehitada ühes keeles, Pythonis.<br/><br/>Lihtne majutus on osa sellest.<br/><br/>Veebiplatvorm on katki ja Anvil on meie katse seda parandada. Ja kuna veebirakenduse juurutamisel on nii palju keerukust, oli pilvepõhine teenus parim viis soovitud lihtsuse tagamiseks. Nii saate luua oma rakenduse Anvil Editoris ja teha selle ühe klõpsuga Internetis elavaks.<br/><br/>Aga me kuulsime pidevalt inimestelt, kes ütlesid: "See on suurepärane, aga..."<br/><br/>"...aga ma pean seda käivitama offshore-platvormil ilma usaldusväärse Interneti-ühenduseta."<br/><br/>"...aga ma tahan pakkida oma rakenduse IoT-seadmesse, mida ma müün"<br/><br/>või lihtsalt: "... aga kui ma panen oma munad sellesse korvi, kuidas ma saan olla kindel, et saan oma rakenduse kümne aasta pärast käivitada?"<br/><br/>Need on kõik head punktid! Pilveteenus ei ole kõigile õige lahendus. Kui me tahame neid kasutajaid teenindada, peab neil olema mingi võimalus oma rakendused Anvilist välja saada ja neid kohapeal oma täieliku kontrolli all käitada.<br/><br/>Avatud allikas: põgenemisluuk, mitte väljatõmmatav iste<br/><br/>Me usume evakuatsiooniluukidesse, mitte väljatõmmatavatesse istmetesse. Konverentsidel küsitakse meilt mõnikord: "Kas ma saan seda eksportida Flask+JS rakendusena?". Muidugi, see oleks võimalik – me võiks luua server pakett, kompileerida kliendi pool Python Javascript, ja sülitada välja klassikaline web app. Aga see oleks tõsiseid puudusi, sest:<br/><br/>Ei ole mugav sõita.<br/><br/>Koodi genereerimine on väljastaja iste. Genereeritav kood on parem kui mitte midagi - vähemalt saate seda redigeerida! Aga hetkel, kui redigeerite seda koodi, kaotate kõik selle genereerinud süsteemi eelised. Kui kasutate Anvili, sest selle drag-and-drop redaktor ja Python brauseris, miks peaks meie kohalikud hostitud kasutajad kasutama vim ja Javascript?<br/><br/>Nii et me tegime seda õigesti: me avasime Anvil'i käivitamise mootori. See on sama kood, mis teenib teie rakendust meie hostitud teenuses, ja see esindab teie rakendust samal viisil. Saate oma koodi redigeerida tekstiredaktoriga, käivitada selle, seejärel git surub selle tagasi meie veebipõhisesse IDE-sse. See ei ole väljastuskoht: plahvatuslikku üleminekut ei ole. See on põgenemisluuk: võite ronida välja ja ronida otse tagasi.<br/><br/>Aga meie ärimudel?<br/><br/>Anvil ei olnud kunagi mõeldud olema üks neist ettevõtte madala koodiga süsteemidest, mis nõuavad teilt $ 20 / mo iga teie rakendust kasutava inimese eest. Anvil on arendaja tööriist. Rakendused, mida te arendate, on teie. Võimaldades teil neid Raspberry Pi-l käivitada, on lahe, kuid see ei muuda meie ärimudelit.<br/><br/>Teeme seda, mida oleme alati teinud: Teeme ja müüme arendustööriista, mis muudab veebirakenduste ehitamise oluliselt lihtsamaks. Pakume Anvili rakenduste hostimist. Pakume kogu arendus- ja hostimisplatvormi kohapeal äriklientidele. Ja muidugi pakume tasuta plaani, et igaüks saaks Anvili kasutada hobi- või hariduslikel eesmärkidel – või alustada millegi ehitamist ja näha, kuidas see läheb.<br/><br/>Oleme avatud lähtekoodiga Anvil App Serveri jaoks (suhteliselt väike) inimeste arv, kes seda vajavad, ja pakkuda ülim kindlustuspoliis. Muidugi, saate luua rakenduse vim ja võõrustada seda ise, ilma et isegi meiega kontot registreeriksite (meil on dokumendid, mis näitavad teile, kuidas!). Kuid Anvil Editor on maailma lihtsaim viis veebirakenduse loomiseks ja meie hostitud teenus on lihtsaim viis selle juurutamiseks - nii et see on see, mida me ootame, et enamik meie kasutajaid jätkaks. Ja saate ehitada enesekindlalt, teades, et avatud lähtekoodiga kood on seal, kui seda vajate.<br/><br/>Proovige seda ise<br/><br/>Kui meie arengufilosoofia resoneerib teiega, miks mitte proovida Anvil ise? |
