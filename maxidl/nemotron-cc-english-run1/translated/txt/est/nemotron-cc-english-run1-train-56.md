| While acknowledging that it's impossible to argue someone into loving something they hate, and vice versa, it's still often enjoyable to attempt the argument. When we talk to people whose opinions directly contradict ours, we're forced to defend our tastes, define our opinions, and analyze why we react the way we do. Which is why we have Why Don't You Like This?, in which two of our staffers will attempt to discover whether people with opposing opinions can get beyond "No, you're wrong!" and have a civil, constructive, and possibly even convincing discussion about their points of contention. Because no matter what talk radio says, there's still a middle ground between "We agree utterly" and "I'm right, and you're stupid and evil."<br/><br/>Scott: Since discussing my Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World apostasy, we've been looking for a case where I can call you out for not liking something wonderful, and we didn't have to look for long. We were sitting right next to each other during Martin Scorsese's Hugo—me, utterly enchanted by its fantastical tribute to the wonders of early silent cinema, and you, apparently resisting it at every turn. Critical consensus has been on my side: It hit the No. 9 spot on our collective Top 15 (though you listed it as your Overrated choice), has won (or placed) in various film-critic awards, and currently enjoys an 83 score on Metacritic. That doesn't mean you're wrong, of course, but the onus is on you to explain why Hugo was, in your words, "hollow and artificial," where many of us saw it as a lovely evocation of Scorsese's childhood and the medium when it was still in its infancy. And please be gentle as you rip this butterfly apart by the wings.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Tasha: I can't be gentle, Scott. Sometimes it hurts less if you rip the Band-Aid off all at once. (And even if it doesn't, who wants to walk around wearing a half-ripped-off Band-Aid? Gross.) The fact is, I found Hugo to be a wearyingly manipulative exercise in fakery, starting from its opening glide through a Paris train station, which reminded me more than anything of Robert Zemeckis' The Polar Express. Unlike Mike D'Angelo, I'm a fan of long, unbroken takes as a way of establishing a space and encouraging viewers to unconsciously hold their breaths as a camera explores an area; but when the space being explored is a slick, shiny CGI creation, and the camera floats weightlessly through it with no physical sense that either the camera or the surroundings are really there, that exploration starts to feel like watching someone else play a videogame. And the rest of the film felt similarly poreless and unreal to me, both in terms of its setting and in terms of its highly contrived, maudlin story.<br/><br/>I don't necessarily have a problem with manufactured, stylized environments in film. I loved Baz Luhrmann's equally sprawling, utterly artificial take on Paris in Moulin Rouge, for instance, but that film has a sense of its own ridiculousness, a sense of humor about how deliberately over-the-top it is. Ditto the stylization of Jean-Pierre Jeunet, particularly in Amélie. (Both Jeunet and Luhrmann felt like strong visual influences here.) I got the sense, however, that Martin Scorsese wanted me to take Hugo entirely seriously. Even though it's yet another achingly sentimental story about a plucky orphan bringing color back into the life of a grumpy old curmudgeon. And I just couldn't.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>There is nothing I enjoy more in film than being surprised. And there's nothing I resent and resist more than being overtly manipulated, being loudly told what to feel and when to feel it. A good film does this kind of thing subtly; a bad one uses crashing music cues and sweet strings—and in this case, a grubby, huge-eyed, disheveled orphan staring woefully at the camera—to demand pathos, and to tell viewers they're horrible people if they don't serve it up on demand. That said, I can deal with sad kids and grumpy adults making life better for each other—I really dug this year's Le Havre, which was essentially the same plot without all the cutesiness—but I find the artificial environments reflect badly on the artificial emotions, and each makes the other seem more fake by turns.<br/><br/>Let's start with that. In our overlooked films video, you and Noel both took Keith to task for championing Tyrannosaur, because you felt it wasn't realistic enough—too contrived, too miserablist, too much, too far. How is it possible that you can't buy a stymied old crank who breaks things when he's angry, but you can buy an orphan living inside a giant train-station clock and embarking upon a whimsical journey to repair a mysterious automaton that he believes might bear secrets from his dead father, but which instead leads him on a quirky voyage of self-discovery, into the magical land of cinema? Did you never find Hugo's gaudy rococo design, aggressive heartstring-plucking, or wheelbarrow-loads of quirk even a little excessive or hard to swallow?<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Scott: Jeunet and Luhrmann as influences on Scorsese?! Forget being indelicate, now you're deliberately poking me with a sharp stick. If you're looking for inspirations for Hugo—indeed, if you're looking for the emotional core of Hugo—you have to go back to Scorsese's childhood on Elizabeth Street in Little Italy, where an asthmatic little boy, unable to play outside with the other kids, retreated to Alexander Korda fantasies like The Thief Of Bagdad. Or, more simply, just go straight to the source himself: George Méliès, whose A Trip To The Moon remains the Big Bang of all cinematic fantasies, that moment when the camera was not used to document the world as it is, but whatever whimsical, magical, transporting place a filmmaker wants to invent for it. And that tradition has been developed and expanded upon for decades before the likes of Jeunet and Luhrmann got their grubby little paws on it.<br/><br/>And speaking of Jeunet, nice attempt to take away my rhetorical weapon, but I'll say it anyway: How can you love Amélie, yet find Hugo synthetic and "excessive" and "wearyingly manipulative"? You say that Amélie and Moulin Rouge have redeeming "sense of [their] own ridiculousness" where Scorsese means us to take Hugo seriously, and I don't think that's the case, at least on the latter point. That Scorsese feels evident passion about the movies is, I suppose, why you'd interpret Hugo as self-serious. But to me, it's those feelings that give the film an emotional ballast that the Luhrmann and Jeunet films don't have. All three films make aggressive use of the marvels of CGI—and Scorsese adds 3D to the mix, to wonderful effect—but where you and I differ is on the issue of weightlessness. I agree that CGI has a distancing effect; worlds composed entirely of digital plasticine are flexible to the point where they sometimes have no presence. You referred to Hugo in your "Overrated" entry for our Best Of Film piece as "a CGI gimcrack"—a perfect dis… for another movie.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>It's fair to say that Scorsese has built Hugo around a standard-issue, "heartstring-plucking" children's book/movie plot: Orphan misses his daddy, creates his own little fantasy world, gloms onto a new friend, convinces a crusty old fuddy-duddy to soften up and maybe adopt him. But that's just the narrative skeleton, and Scorsese provides plenty of flesh and blood. For one, you can't watch Hugo, the lonely boy, peering out from clock towers to the hustle-and-bustle of a Paris train station without thinking of Scorsese, another lonely boy, staring out of his bedroom window on Elizabeth Street. And even if you're not a big enough film nerd to make that connection, I really feel like Hugo's journey is not in finding a new father figure, but in persisting with the mechanical magic that stands as his own father's legacy. That's what film is: The persistence of vision that allows us to accept an illusory version of the world at 24 frames per second is science and magic at once. Hugo's relationship with Méliès isn't about him cozying up to a new daddy, but sharing a common enthusiasm the old man has submerged in bitterness. To me, that's a far more unique angle on a potentially shopworn premise.<br/><br/>Did you really find none of Hugo enchanting? Even the film's few detractors seem willing to admit that the sequences evoking cinema history and Méliès' studio—with Michael Stuhlbarg as the heroic film scholar!—were terrific. It felt, in the best possible way, like a heady compression of my History Of Film 101 class in college, condensing a semester's worth of clips and context into something between a montage and an animated pop-up book. And it speaks to the ingenious design of the film, which layers fact and fantasy so beautifully that it's at once a history of Méliès and the birth of cinema, and just the sort of simple, sumptuously produced cinematic wonder that Scorsese himself would have loved as a child. Thank goodness Hugo doesn't follow the Jeunet/Luhrmann model and have "a sense of its own ridiculousness." As a fantasy connoisseur yourself, wouldn't you say there's value in playing it straight and earnest and unabashed rather than winking at the audience? You may find Hugo sickly sweet, but I don't think the authenticity of its sentiment is to be denied.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Tasha: Yes, I did in fact find parts of Hugo enchanting. (Notice how I'm answering your question up front, whereas you were too busy frothing with apoplexy to address mine, though I assume that's an answer in its own right. Okay, "influence" may be overstating the case—I just meant the visual style looked very familiar. Though as Keith pointed out when you brought this up in person, Scorsese is neither opposed to drawing inspiration from other people's visuals, nor immune to it.) Primarily, I was enchanted by the parts dealing with Georges Méliès' backstory, with his love of cinema, with the work he put into his art and the joy he got out of it. There's an awful lot of beauty and fun in the staging of the underwater-court scene from Méliès' "Fairyland," and in the sequence at the end, focusing on Méliès footage. I'll grant you that Hugo's connection with Méliès over a shared love of film is a nice touch. And I do enjoy a good film about filmmaking.<br/><br/>But Hugo isn't primarily about film, in spite of the Méliès tie-ins. In addition to the themes you cite, it's also about finding your purpose, as the characters expressly, laboriously explain to each other and to us. And it's about spectacle, and big action setpieces, and chases, and happily-ever-after endings where even the angry bully and the shy older couple and fergawdsakes even the cranky dachshund all get paired off with charming love interests by the end. It's about the super-precocious Hermione Granger-type being bossy and perky and clever and praising the magical worlds encased in books. And all of this business is mighty familiar, and mighty artificial.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Yes, Scorsese is playing with archetypes. Problem is, I never felt he imbued them with anything new, fresh, or believable, in spite of his own backstory. I would have much preferred a story about a young Scorsese growing up with asthma—something small-scale and real, without vast rooms full of CGI clockwork and golden glowing dust-motes and prophetic dreams and a raging adult tyrant-guard with a heart of gold—all of that outsized, over-the-top nonsense. You keep citing Scorsese's personal background and love of film as evidence that he's really feeling what he's putting on the screen, but I don't feel his personal touch in any of this, except the moments that are expressly about film. The core emotions may be real, but that doesn't make the execution less false.<br/><br/>You say the authenticity of the emotion isn't to be denied. I don't question whether Scorsese personally felt lonely and isolated as a child, but I don't feel loneliness and isolation on the screen—I see a bunch of exaggerated signifiers (Hugo is filthy and his clothes are worn and all the adults yell at him and he regularly gets chased by a scary dog!) and big beats, with shouting and weeping and Spielbergian wonder-emoting. For me, sincerity is more convincing and more personal when it's quiet and direct; when someone's shouting his opinions at me, I assume he's either really angry, or just trying to overwhelm my senses to keep me from expressing my own opinion. Hugo was one long shout, as far as I was concerned.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Why didn't I get that sense of fakery from Amélie, you ask? Actually, I did. I'll completely acknowledge that Amélie and Moulin Rouge are both big, manipulative, artificial constructions in the exact same vein, demanding specific emotions at specific intervals, and trying to sell those emotions with heavy emoting and aggressive soundtrack prodding. Neither of them really sold me on their emotions as authentic human feeling. What I enjoyed in those two films was the construction—particularly Amélie's heady, laughable lists of random characterizing features and experiences for its cast, and Moulin Rouge's musical-magpie mashups and recontextualizations. I'm often sold on stories that do creative or ambitious things with structure, and both of those movies qualify, where Hugo is a much more linear, standard kid-quest.<br/><br/>But in the end, for me, it really does come down to a feeling that those movies are goofs, whereas Hugo is meant to be taken seriously at every treacly moment. You don't think that's true—but you're simultaneously defending its integrity in terms of its absolutely authentic, rooted-in-Scorsese's-history emotion, and telling me I'm wrong, and he doesn't mean it to be taken seriously. How do you reconcile those two statements? What about the film suggests to you that it isn't meant to be taken at face value? And is it possible this is just another Curious Case Of Benjamin Button-like situation where I find the use of kids in big-budget films to be largely sappy and melodramatic, whereas you as a dad find it bypasses your cynicism and goes straight to your family-feeling?<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Scott: Not sure I meant that Scorsese doesn't mean to be taken seriously; it's just that he's chosen a whimsical vehicle through which to express a serious love of the movies. When you say, "But Hugo isn't primarily about film, in spite of the Méliès tie-ins," I'm mystified. I grant that you find many elements of Hugo overly familiar and laborious and full of Spielbergian wonder-emoting—there's nothing I can do to argue around that perception, which other Hugo doubters share. Sometimes a film means to charm and enchant, and it doesn't for some; you've got Hugo and I've got Amélie, though I think the latter, deliberately artificial as it is, means for us to find it romantic. (Rather than, say, some horrible mechanical contraption fit for a Saw sequel.)<br/><br/>But to say Hugo isn't primarily about film? If it's not about film, then it's the most pointlessly discursive story about [whatever you think it's about] I've ever seen. The relationship between Hugo and Méliès is the heart of the movie, and at the heart of that is not just some stock connection between Plucky Orphan and Crusty Old Guy With A Heart Of Gold, but a shared affinity for engineered magic—specifically the magic of the movies. I think Scorsese and his collaborators have found a way to express their enthusiasm over the early days of cinema through a fantasy that's accessible to all ages. The archetype-filled children's tale is the merely the crust here; cinema is the pie. (Mmmm… pie.)<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>As for The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button, I don't see much of a connection, other than trying to expose me as a Benjamin Button defender as a way of damaging my credibility. (Incidentally, how are the extras on that G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra Blu-ray?) I've said to you that the sleep-deprived new dad in me was perhaps vulnerable to Benjamin Button, but I can't imagine a time when the premise of aging in reverse wouldn't move me. (Cradling the love of your life in your arms as an infant? How can you not be affected by that?) And besides, I don't see how Benjamin Button relates much to Hugo as a film concerning kids, since that's just a small segment of a story that spans a much larger trajectory.<br/><br/>So have I convinced you? Likely not. But I'm happy to learn that Hugo wasn't entirely devoid of enchantments for you. The sequences on Méliès the filmmaker are what put Hugo over for me—and in that, at least, we can share some movie love.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Tasha: Nope, I can't say you've convinced me, any more than I've convinced you. It's impossible to argue anyone into a visceral love of anything, and it really should be equally impossible to talk someone down from visceral love. Mostly, you've let me see Hugo in Scott-O-Vision, which is an interesting experience; at least now I'm mildly convinced that we didn't somehow manage to see entirely different films which both somehow had the same name and director.<br/><br/>We certainly had different experiences, though, and to my mind, focused on different aspects of the production: I still don't see the "film is marvelous" theme as the movie's single strand, so much as one among too many. "Pointlessly discursive" almost covers it, though I'd throw in "often needlessly cutesy and precious" on top of that. While you're focused on the film's tasty pie filling, I feel like that pie was covered with a pound of crystallized sugar, and I think that does make a difference, regardless of the film's core message or handful of terrific scenes. See also Benjamin Button, which I did not bring up just to chafe you—I really do think you have more of a sentimental streak than I do regarding children in cinema, especially when they're used more as symbols of vulnerability and innocence than as human characters. Hey, you know what film totally does not have cute wide-eyed moppets bringing hope to a cynical world? G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra. Maybe I will go watch those Blu-ray extras. I could use some explosion-insulin to compensate for Hugo's sweetness. | Kuigi tunnistades, et on võimatu väita, et keegi armastab midagi, mida nad vihkavad, ja vastupidi, on sageli meeldiv proovida argumenti. Kui me räägime inimestega, kelle arvamused on meie omadega otseselt vastuolus, oleme sunnitud kaitsma oma maitset, määratlema oma arvamused ja analüüsima, miks me reageerime nii, nagu me teeme.

Ükskõik, mida raadio räägib, on siiski kesktee "Me nõustume täielikult" ja "Mul on õigus, ja sa oled rumal ja kuri."<br/><br/>Alates sellest, kui me arutasime oma Scott Pilgrimi vs. Maailma ärataganemist, oleme otsinud juhtumit, kus ma võin teid välja kutsuda, et teile ei meeldi midagi imelist, ja me ei pidanud kaua otsima. Me istusime üksteise kõrval Martin Scorsese'i Hugo ajal - mina, kes oli täiesti lummatud oma fantastilisest austusest varajase vaikse kino imedele, ja sina, kes ilmselt sellele igal sammul vastu seisid. Kriitiline konsensus on olnud minu poolel: see tabas meie kollektiivse TOP 15-s nr 9 kohta (kuigi te loetlesite selle oma ülehinnatud valikuna), on võitnud (või paigutanud) erinevate filmikriitiliste auhindade eest ja naudib praegu Metacriticis 83i skoori. See ei tähenda muidugi, et sa eksid, kuid teie ülesanne on selgitada, miks Hugo oli teie sõnade kohaselt "õõnes ja kunstlik", kus paljud meist nägid seda Scorsese lapsepõlve ja keskmisena, kui see oli veel lapsekingades. Ja palun olge õrnad, kui rebite selle liblika tiibade juurest tükkideks.<br/><br/>Reklaam<br/><br/>Tasha: Ma ei saa olla õrn, Scott. Mõnikord on see vähem valus, kui sa rebida Band-Aid kõik korraga. (Ja isegi kui see ei ole, kes tahab jalutada seljas pool-rebenenud Band-Aid? Gross.) Fakt on see, et ma leidsin, et Hugo on väsitavalt manipuleeriv harjutus võltsingus, alustades selle avamisest, mis libiseb läbi Pariisi rongijaama, mis meenutas mulle rohkem kui midagi Robert Zemecki Polar Expressist. Erinevalt Mike D'Angelo, ma olen fänn pikk, katkematu võtab viis luua ruumi ja julgustada vaatajaid alateadlikult hoida oma hinge kinni, kui kaamera uurib ala; kuid kui ruumi uuritakse on libe, läikiv CGI looming, ja kaamera ujub kaalutult läbi selle ilma füüsilise mõttes, et keegi vaadates kas kaamera või ümbruskonnas on tõesti seal, et uurimine algab tunne, et mäng Ja ülejäänud film tundus mulle sarnaselt poorne ja ebareaalne, nii selle seadistuse kui ka selle väga väljamõeldud, maudlini loo poolest.<br/><br/>Mul ei ole tingimata probleeme valmistatud, stiliseeritud keskkondadega filmis. Mulle meeldis Baz Luhrmanni võrdselt laialivalguv, täiesti kunstlik võte Pariisis Moulin Rouge'is, näiteks, kuid sellel filmil on oma naeruväärsus, huumorimeel selle kohta, kui tahtlikult see on. Jean-Pierre Jeunet’ stiliseerimisest, eriti Amélie’s. (Nii Jeunet kui ka Luhrmann tundsid siin tugevat visuaalset mõju.) Sain siiski aru, et Martin Scorsese tahtis, et ma võtaksin Hugot täiesti tõsiselt. Kuigi see on järjekordne valusalt sentimentaalne lugu sellest, kuidas kitsik orb toob värvi tagasi räpase vanuri ellu, ja ma lihtsalt ei suutnud.<br/><br/>Reklaam<br/><br/>Filmis pole midagi, mis mulle rohkem meeldiks kui üllatumine. Ja pole midagi, mis mulle rohkem pahandaks ja vastu seisaks kui avalikult manipuleeritav, valjult öeldu, mida tunda ja millal seda tunda. Hea film teeb sellist asja peenelt; halb kasutab krahhivaid muusikalisi vihjeid ja magusaid stringe - ja sel juhul, räpane, tohutu silmaga, räpane orb, kes vaatab kaamerat kurvalt -, et nõuda paatost ja öelda vaatajatele, et nad on kohutavad inimesed, kui nad ei teeni seda nõudmisel. See tähendab, et ma saan tegeleda kurbade laste ja ärevate täiskasvanutega, kes muudavad elu üksteise jaoks paremaks - ma tõesti kaevasin selle aasta Le Havre'i, mis oli sisuliselt sama krunt ilma igasuguse iluta -, kuid ma leian, et kunstlikud keskkonnad peegeldavad kunstlikke emotsioone halvasti ja igaüks muudab teise kordamööda võltsimaks.<br/><br/>Alustame sellest. Meie tähelepanuta jäänud filmivideos viisid sina ja Noel Keithi Tyrannosauruse eest võitlema, sest te tundsite, et see ei ole piisavalt realistlik - liiga väljamõeldud, liiga õnnetu, liiga kaugele. Kuidas on võimalik, et sa ei saa osta stimied vana kraami, mis murrab asju, kui ta on vihane, kuid sa võid osta orb elab sees hiiglaslik rongijaama kella ja alustada kapriisne teekond parandada salapärane automaat, mis ta usub võib kanda saladusi tema surnud isa, kuid mis selle asemel viib teda kummaline teekond ise avastada, et maagiline maa kino? Kas sa ei leidnud kunagi Hugo gay rokokoo kujundust, agressiivset heartstring-trucking'i või isegi natuke ülemäärast või rasket neelata?<br/><br/>Reklaam<br/><br/>Scott: Jeunet ja Luhrmann mõjutusi Scorsese?! Unusta, et ebaviisakas, nüüd sa sihilikult torkavad mind terava kepiga. Kui otsite Hugo jaoks inspiratsiooni - tõepoolest, kui otsite Hugo emotsionaalset südamikku - peate minema tagasi Scorsese lapsepõlve Elizabethi tänaval Väikeses Itaalias, kus astmaatiline väike poiss, kes ei saa teiste lastega mängida, taganes Alexander Korda fantaasiatele nagu The Thief Of Bagdad. Või lihtsalt mine otse allika juurde: George Méliès, kelle reis Kuule jääb kõigi kinematiliste fantaasiate suureks pauguks, see hetk, mil kaamerat ei kasutatud maailma dokumenteerimiseks nii, nagu see on, vaid mis tahes kapriisne, maagiline, transportiv koht, mida filmitegija tahab selle jaoks leiutada. Ja seda traditsiooni on arendatud ja laiendatud aastakümneid, enne kui Jeunet ja Luhrmann said oma räpased väikesed käpad.<br/><br/>Ja rääkides Jeunetist, kena katse võtta mu retooriline relv, aga ma ütlen seda ikkagi: kuidas sa saad armastada Amélie't, samas kui Hugo on sünteetiline ja "ülemäärane" ja "väsitavalt manipuleeriv"? Sa ütled, et Amélie ja Moulin Rouge on lunastanud "oma naeruväärsuse tunde", kus Scorsese tähendab, et me võtame Hugo tõsiselt, ja ma ei usu, et see on nii, vähemalt viimases punktis. See, et Scorsese tunneb ilmset kirge filmide vastu, on vist põhjus, miks te peate Hugot enesetõsiseks, aga minu jaoks on need tunded need, mis annavad filmile emotsionaalse raskuse, mida Luhrmanni ja Jeuneti filmidel pole. Kõik kolm filmi kasutavad agressiivselt CGI imesid - ja Scorsese lisab segule 3D, imelise efektiga -, kuid kus teie ja mina erineme kaalutuse küsimuses. Olen nõus, et CGI-l on distantseeriv mõju; maailmad, mis koosnevad täielikult digitaalsest plastiinist, on paindlikud kuni punktini, kus neil mõnikord ei ole kohalolekut. Sa viitasid Hugo oma "Overrated" kande meie parim film tükk kui "CGI gimcrack"-täiuslik dis ... teise filmi.<br/><br/>Reklaam<br/><br/>Õiglane on öelda, et Scorsese on ehitanud Hugo ümber standardküsimuse, "südame stringimise" lasteraamatu / filmi krundi: orb igatseb oma isa, loob oma väikese fantaasiamaailma, lööb uuele sõbrale, veenab krõbedat vana fuddy-duddy pehmendama ja võib-olla teda vastu võtma. Aga see on lihtsalt narratiivi skelett ja Scorsese pakub palju liha ja verd. Esiteks, sa ei saa vaadata Hugot, üksildast poissi, kes vaatab kellatornist välja Pariisi raudteejaama tormi, mõtlemata Scorsese'ile, teisele üksildasele poisile, kes vaatab oma magamistoa aknast välja Elizabeth Streetil. Ja isegi kui sa pole piisavalt suur filminohik, et seda seost luua, tundub mulle, et Hugo teekond ei seisne uue isakuju leidmises, vaid mehaanilise maagiaga, mis on tema enda isa pärand. See on see, mida film on: nägemuse püsivus, mis võimaldab meil aktsepteerida maailma illusoorset versiooni 24 kaadrit sekundis, on teadus ja maagia korraga. Hugo suhe Mélièsiga ei seisne selles, et ta uue issi juurde hubane on, vaid selles, et vanamees on ühise entusiasmi jaganud, on ta kibestunud.<br/><br/>Isegi filmi vähesed kriitikud näivad olevat valmis tunnistama, et filmi ajalugu ja Mélièsi stuudiot meenutavad järjestused – kangelasliku filmiteadlase Michael Stuhlbargiga! – olid kohutavad. See tundus parimal võimalikul viisil, nagu minu kolledži filmiajaloo 101 klassi peapööritav kokkusurumine, kondenseerides semestri klippide ja konteksti väärtuse midagi monteerimise ja animeeritud pop-up raamatu vahel. Ja see räägib filmi geniaalsest disainist, mis kihistab fakte ja fantaasiat nii kaunilt, et see on korraga Mélièsi ajalugu ja kino sündi, ja lihtsalt selline lihtne, uhkelt toodetud filmiline ime, mida Scorsese ise oleks lapsepõlves armastanud. Jumal tänatud, et Hugo ei järgi Jeunet/Luhrmanni mudelit ja tal on "oma naeruväärsuse tunne". Nagu fantaasia asjatundja ise, kas sa ei ütleks, et see on väärt mängides seda sirge ja tõsine ja rahulik, selle asemel, et publikut pilgutada? Sa võid leida Hugo haigelt armas, kuid ma ei usu, et tema tunnete autentsust eitada.<br/><br/>Reklaam<br/><br/>Tasha: Jah, ma tegelikult leidsin Hugo osad võluvad. (Näita, kuidas ma vastan teie küsimusele ees, samas kui sa olid liiga hõivatud vahutamine insuldi, et tegeleda minu, kuigi ma eeldan, et see on vastus omaette. Olgu, "mõju" võib juhtumit ülehinnata - ma lihtsalt mõtlesin, et visuaalne stiil tundus väga tuttav. Kuigi nagu Keith märkis, kui te seda isiklikult tõstatasite, ei ole Scorsese vastu teiste inimeste visuaalide inspiratsiooni tõmbamisele ega sellele immuunne.) Peamiselt võlusid mind Georges Mélièsi taustalugudega tegelevad osad, tema armastus kino vastu, töö, mille ta oma kunsti pani ja rõõmu, mida ta sellest sai. Mélièsi "Fairylandi" veealuse kohtu stseeni lavastuses ja lõpus olevas järjestuses on kohutavalt palju ilu ja lõbusust, keskendudes Mélièsi kaadrile. Ma tunnistan, et Hugo seotus Mélièsiga jagatud filmiarmastuse üle on kena puudutus ja mulle meeldib hea film filmitegemisest.<br/><br/>Kuid Hugo ei ole peamiselt filmist, hoolimata Mélièsi sidemetest. Lisaks teemadele, mida te tsiteerite, on see ka teie eesmärgi leidmisest, nagu tegelased selgesõnaliselt selgitavad üksteisele ja meile. Ja see on vaatemängust ja suurtest tegevustest, ja tagaajamistest ja õnnelikust lõpust, kus isegi vihane kiusaja ja häbelik vanem paar ja fergawdsakes isegi kärakas mäkrad saavad lõpuks võluvate armastuse huvidega paari. Asi on selles, et super-varajane Hermione Granger-tüüp on bossy ja nüri ja nutikas ja kiidab maagilisi maailmu, mis on kaetud raamatutega. Ja kogu see äri on väga tuttav ja võimas kunstlik.<br/><br/>Reklaam<br/><br/>Jah, Scorsese mängib arhetüüpidega. Probleem on selles, et ma pole kunagi tundnud, et ta on neid midagi uut, värsket või usutavat, hoolimata oma taustast. Ma oleksin palju eelistanud lugu noorest Scorsese'ist, kes kasvas üles astmaga - midagi väikest ja tõelist, ilma suurte tubadeta, mis on täis CGI kella ja kuldseid hõõguvaid tolmu-mote ja prohvetlikke unistusi ning raevukas täiskasvanud türann-valvur, kellel on kuldne süda - kõik see üleliigne, üle-top mõttetus. Sa tsiteerid Scorsese'i isiklikku tausta ja armastust filmi vastu tõendina, et ta tõesti tunneb, mida ta ekraanile paneb, kuid ma ei tunne tema isiklikku puudutust üheski selles, välja arvatud hetked, mis on otseselt filmi kohta. Põhilised emotsioonid võivad olla tõelised, kuid see ei muuda hukkamist vähem valeks.<br/><br/>Sa ütled, et emotsiooni autentsust ei saa eitada. Ma ei kahtle, kas Scorsese isiklikult tundis üksildane ja isoleeritud kui laps, kuid ma ei tunne üksindust ja isolatsiooni ekraanil - ma näen kamp liialdatud tähistajad (Hugo on määrdunud ja tema riided on kulunud ja kõik täiskasvanud karjuvad teda ja ta regulaarselt saab jälitab hirmutav koer!) ja suur peksab, karjumine ja nutt-Spielberg Minu jaoks on siirus veenvam ja isiklikum, kui see on vaikne ja otsene; kui keegi karjub oma arvamusi mulle, eeldan, et ta on kas tõesti vihane või lihtsalt üritab mu meeli üle suruda, et ma ei väljendaks oma arvamust. Hugo oli üks pikk karjumine, niipalju kui mina olin mures.<br/><br/>Reklaam<br/><br/>Miks ma ei saanud seda võltsimistunnet Amélie'lt, sa küsid? Ma tunnistan täielikult, et Amélie ja Moulin Rouge on mõlemad suured, manipuleerivad, kunstlikud konstruktsioonid täpselt samas veenis, nõudes konkreetseid emotsioone teatud ajavahemike järel ja püüdes neid emotsioone müüa raskete emoteerivate ja agressiivsete soundtrackide prodigeerimisega. Kumbki neist ei müünud mind oma tunnetega kui ehtsat inimtunnet. Mis mulle nendes kahes filmis meeldis, oli ehitus - eriti Amélie peaga naeruväärsed nimekirjad juhuslikest omadustest ja kogemustest tema valatud ja Moulin Rouge'i muusikalis-magpie mashupid ja rekontekstualisatsioonid. Mulle müüakse sageli lugusid, mis teevad loomingulisi või ambitsioonikaid asju struktuuriga, ja mõlemad need filmid kvalifitseeruvad, kus Hugo on palju lineaarsem, standardne lapsekülastus.<br/><br/>Aga lõppude lõpuks, minu jaoks, see tõesti taandub tunne, et need filmid on rumalad, samas Hugo on mõeldud tõsiselt võtta igal pettumuslik hetk. Sa ei arva, et see on tõsi - kuid samal ajal kaitsete selle terviklikkust selle absoluutselt autentse, Scorsese'i ajaloos juurdunud emotsiooni osas ja ütlete mulle, et ma eksin, ja ta ei taha seda tõsiselt võtta. Kuidas te neid kahte väidet ühitate? Mis filmist arvate, et seda ei tohiks võtta nimeliselt? Ja kas on võimalik, et see on lihtsalt järjekordne Benjamin Buttoni kummaline juhtum, kus ma leian, et laste kasutamine suure eelarvega filmides on suures osas mahlakas ja melodramaatiline, samas kui sina kui isa leiad, et see möödub teie küünilisusest ja läheb otse teie peretunde juurde?<br/><br/>Reklaam<br/><br/>Scott: Ma ei ole kindel, et ma mõtlesin, et Scorsese ei taha tõsiselt võtta; see on lihtsalt, et ta on valinud kapriisne sõiduk, mille kaudu väljendada tõsist armastust filme. Kui te ütlete: "Aga Hugo ei ole peamiselt filmist, hoolimata Mélièsi sidemetest," olen ma müstiline. Ma tunnistan, et paljud Hugo elemendid on liiga tuttavad ja töökad ning täis Spielbergi ime-emotsiooni - ma ei saa midagi teha, et vaielda selle arusaama üle, mida teised Hugo kahtlejad jagavad. Mõnikord tähendab film sarmi ja võlu, ja see ei ole mõnede jaoks; teil on Hugo ja mul on Amélie, kuigi ma arvan, et viimane, tahtlikult kunstlik, nagu see on, tähendab, et me leiame selle romantiliseks. (Selle asemel, ütleme, et mõni kohutav mehaaniline seade sobib Saw järge.)<br/><br/>Aga öelda, et Hugo ei ole peamiselt filmist? Kui see ei ole filmist, siis on see kõige mõttetumalt diskursiivne lugu [mida sa arvad, et see on] ma olen kunagi näinud. Hugo ja Mélièsi vaheline suhe on filmi süda, ja selle keskmes ei ole mitte ainult mingi seos Plucky Orphani ja Crusty Old Guy vahel, kellel on kuldne süda, vaid jagatud afiinsus insenertehnilise maagiaga - eriti filmide maagiaga. Ma arvan, et Scorsese ja tema kaastöötajad on leidnud viisi, kuidas väljendada oma entusiasmi kino algusaegadel läbi fantaasia, mis on kättesaadav igas vanuses. Arhetüübiga täidetud laste lugu on siin lihtsalt koorik; kino on pirukas. (Mmmm... jalg.)<br/><br/>Reklaam<br/><br/>Mis puutub Benjamin Buttoni uudishimulikku juhtumisse, siis ma ei näe palju seost, välja arvatud püüdes ennast Benjamin Buttoni kaitsjana paljastada, et kahjustada minu usaldusväärsust. (Muide, kuidas on G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra Blu-ray lisad?) Ma olen teile öelnud, et unepuuduses olev uus isa minus oli võib-olla haavatav Benjamin Buttonile, kuid ma ei suuda ette kujutada aega, mil vananemise eeldus vastupidine ei liigutaks mind. Ja pealegi, ma ei saa aru, kuidas Benjamin Button Hugoga lastefilmina seotud on, sest see on vaid väike osa loost, mis ulatub palju suurema trajektoorini.<br/><br/>Kas ma olen teid veennud? Tõenäoliselt mitte. Aga mul on hea meel teada saada, et Hugo ei olnud teie jaoks täiesti nõidustest vaba. Filmitegija Mélièsi järjestused on see, mis pani Hugo minu jaoks - ja selles vähemalt saame jagada filmi armastust.<br/><br/>Reklaam<br/><br/>Tasha: Ei, ma ei saa öelda, et olete mind veennud, nagu ma olen sind veennud. On võimatu väita, et keegi on sisemine armastus midagi, ja see peaks olema sama võimatu rääkida keegi maha sisemine armastus. Enamasti olete lubanud mul näha Hugo Scott-O-Vision, mis on huvitav kogemus; vähemalt nüüd olen ma kergelt veendunud, et me kuidagi ei suutnud näha täiesti erinevaid filme, mis mõlemad kuidagi oli sama nimi ja režissöör.<br/><br/>Meil olid kindlasti erinevad kogemused ja minu meelest keskendusid tootmise erinevad aspektid: ma ei näe ikka veel filmi "film on imeline" teemat filmi ühe ahelana, nii palju kui üks paljudest. "Punktsionaalselt diskursiivne" peaaegu katab selle, kuigi ma viskaksin selle peale "sageli tarbetult armas ja väärtuslik". Kuigi olete keskendunud filmi maitsvale piruka täitmisele, tunnen, et see pirukas oli kaetud kristalliseerunud suhkruga ja ma arvan, et see muudab erinevust, olenemata filmi põhisõnumist või käputäis kohutavaid stseene. Vaata ka Benjamin Buttonit, mida ma ei tõstatanud ainult teie jaoks - ma tõesti arvan, et teil on rohkem sentimentaalset triipu kui ma teen laste kohta kinos, eriti kui neid kasutatakse pigem haavatavuse ja süütuse sümbolitena kui inimtegelastena. Hei, sa tead, mis film täiesti ei ole armas laia silmaga moppets tuua lootust küüniline maailm? G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra. Võib-olla ma lähen vaatan neid Blu-ray lisad. Ma võiks kasutada mõned plahvatus-insuliin kompenseerida Hugo magusus. |
| "I hoped my daughter would be free from difficult and troubling times": Mee Mee's story as a refugee Mom<br/><br/>Hope in Times of Crisis: A Mother's Day Story<br/><br/>By Judith Santiago*<br/><br/>Mee Mee heard that the soldiers were coming. She took hold of her son and frantically joined the rest of the villagers who were running toward the Thai-Burmese border, where the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) was located. Her husband was in another village running in the opposite direction, Mee later learned. After the soldiers' pursuit ended, Mee returned home to her small village in Koechi, Burma.<br/><br/>During 1997-2000, Mee and thousands like her lived under the constant threat of violence from Burmese soldiers. Many people would take temporary refuge in the jungle, and return home to their village after soldiers left the area, just to do it all over again days later. About once a week, Mee and others would be on the move to avoid capture, rape, or death by soldiers.<br/><br/>During one incident, Mee's husband ran ahead of his wife to secure food for his family. Her husband was spotted by soldiers and shot. The bullet shattered a portion of his ribcage, leaving him severely wounded and in distress as he journeyed toward the jungle with his family for safety.<br/><br/>For three months, Mee's husband hid and moved the family with an exasperating wound at his side. He received no medical care, except for Mee's tending.<br/><br/>"I was afraid to return to Burma," Mee said through an interpreter. "I feared dying. I cried and cried every day," she continued.<br/><br/>Mee's husband eventually drew enough strength to walk five days toward a small village in Thailand where they learned the location of a hospital and a refugee camp. When Mee and her husband finally arrived at the hospital, he underwent immediate surgery and later recovered.<br/><br/>Symbol of Hope<br/><br/>Life in the jungle for those fleeing Burmese soldiers was indeed terrifying and difficult. Makeshift bamboo tents with only roof and floor coverings became suitable temporary dwellings. Many women including Mee gave birth to children in the jungle. Mee's then six-year-old son assisted in the delivery of his sister named Eh Ku Hser. Her name means love – cold – sweet. "Cold" in Burmese culture means so as to not pass through the fire of life, as heat represents troubled times.<br/><br/>"I hoped my daughter would be free from difficult and troubling times," said Mee. "I did not want her to go through what I had experienced," she continued.<br/><br/>For Mee, the birth of her daughter in the midst of darkness, torment and fear, was a symbol of hope for a new life to come. Hope in times of crisis, the very premise of the United Methodist Committee on Relief's (UMCOR) newly co-branded UMCOR-Prosperity Candle, is also the essence of that which candles shed light upon.<br/><br/>A New Beginning<br/><br/>With the help of UNHCR, hope for a new life did indeed materialize for Mee and her family when they resettled in West Springfield, Massachusetts. There, Mee met Moo Kho Paw, another woman who emigrated from Burma, and who was working at Prosperity Candle in Florence. The organization helps refugee women who have escaped areas of conflict rebuild their lives through the art of candle making. Moo Kho recommended that Mee join the organization, and Mee gladly accepted.<br/><br/>"I was excited to be out of the house," said Mee, "I was raised to believe that because I was a woman, my role was to remain at home and raise my family," she continued. "While many Burmese women want to do more for themselves, they are often encouraged to remain homemakers."<br/><br/>Today, Mee has plans to go into the candle-making business for herself and support her five children, but she expressed the need to learn English first.<br/><br/>"In the Thai refugee camp, we had education, but it was not so good," said Mee. "When I was a child, I wanted to go to school, but I was told to stay home because I was a woman. Now, I have hopes for my daughters to go to college and become doctors or policewomen," continued Mee.<br/><br/>Mee has struck an even balance in her life that she wishes others would have found—a simple, happy life where work, caring for family members and freedom of choice all have their place.<br/><br/>Support Refugee Women in the US<br/><br/>Share this Mother's Day story with your loved ones. And, when you purchase handmade candles by Mee, Moo Kho, and Naw, another Burmese refugee woman working at Prosperity Candle , know you are helping to support their livelihood as they rebuild their lives and those of their family members in the US. | "Ma lootsin, et mu tütar on vaba rasketest ja murettekitavatest aegadest": Mee Mee lugu pagulase emana<br/><br/>Lootus kriisi ajal: emadepäeva lugu<br/><br/>Judith Santiago poolt*<br/><br/>Mee Mee kuulis, et sõdurid tulevad. Ta haaras kinni oma pojast ja ühines meeleheitlikult ülejäänud külaelanikega, kes jooksid Tai-Birma piiri suunas, kus asub ÜRO Pagulaste Ülemvoliniku Amet (UNHCR). Tema abikaasa oli teises külas, mis jooksis vastassuunas, sai Mee hiljem teada. Kui sõdurite jälitamine lõppes, naasis Mee koju oma väikesesse külasse Koechisse, Birmasse.<br/><br/>Aastatel 1997-2000 elasid Mee ja tuhanded temasarnased Birma sõdurid pideva vägivallaohus. Paljud inimesed otsivad ajutist varjupaika džunglis ja naasevad oma külasse pärast seda, kui sõdurid on piirkonnast lahkunud, lihtsalt selleks, et seda kõike uuesti teha. Umbes kord nädalas oleks Mee ja teised liikvel, et vältida sõdurite vangistamist, vägistamist või surma.<br/><br/>Ühe intsidendi ajal jooksis Mee abikaasa oma naisest ette, et kindlustada oma perele toitu. Kuul purustas osa tema ribide korpusest, jättes ta raskelt haavatud ja hädas, kui ta reisis oma perega džunglisse ohutuse tagamiseks.<br/><br/>Kolm kuud Mee abikaasa peitis ja kolis pere ärritava haavaga tema kõrval. Ta ei saanud arstiabi, välja arvatud Mee hooldamine.<br/><br/>"Ma kartsin Birmasse tagasi pöörduda," ütles Mee tõlgi kaudu. "Ma kartsin surra. Ma nutsin ja nutsin iga päev," jätkas ta.<br/><br/>Mee abikaasa kogus lõpuks piisavalt jõudu, et kõndida viis päeva väikesesse külasse Tais, kus nad õppisid haigla ja põgenikelaagri asukohta. Kui Mee ja tema abikaasa lõpuks haiglasse jõudsid, läks ta kohe operatsioonile ja hiljem taastus.<br/><br/>Lootuse sümbol<br/><br/>Elu džunglis põgenevate Birma sõdurite jaoks oli tõepoolest hirmutav ja raske. Makeshift bambusest telgid, millel oli ainult katus ja põrandakate, said sobivateks ajutisteks eluruumideks. Paljud naised, sealhulgas Mee, sünnitasid lapsi džunglis. Mee toonane kuueaastane poeg abistas oma õe Eh Ku Hseri sünnitusel. Tema nimi tähendab armastust – külma – magusat. "Külm" Birma kultuuris tähendab, et mitte läbida elu tuld, sest kuumus esindab rahutuid aegu.<br/><br/>"Ma lootsin, et mu tütar on vaba rasketest ja murettekitavatest aegadest," ütles Mee. "Ma ei tahtnud, et ta läbiks seda, mida ma kogesin," jätkas ta.<br/><br/>Mee jaoks oli tütre sünd keset pimedust, piina ja hirmu, uue elu lootuse sümbol. Lootus kriisiaegadel, just eeldus United Methodist Committee on Relief (UMCOR) äsja kaas-bränditud UMCOR-Heaolu küünal, on ka sisuliselt, mida küünlad valgustada.<br/><br/>Uus algus<br/><br/>UNHCR-i abiga sai Mee ja tema pere uue elu lootus tõepoolest teoks, kui nad asusid ümber Massachusettsis West Springfieldis. Seal kohtus Mee Moo Kho Paw'ga, teise naisega, kes emigreerus Birmast ja töötas Florence'i jõukuse küünlas. Organisatsioon aitab konfliktipiirkondadest põgenenud põgenike naistel küünla tegemise kunsti abil oma elu taastada. Moo Kho soovitas Meel organisatsiooniga liituda ja Meel oli hea meel selle vastu võtta.<br/><br/>"Ma olin elevil, et olin majast väljas," ütles Mee, "ma kasvasin üles uskuma, et kuna ma olin naine, oli minu roll kodus püsida ja oma perekonda kasvatada," jätkas ta. "Kuigi paljud Birma naised tahavad ise rohkem teha, julgustatakse neid sageli jääma koduomanikeks."<br/><br/>Täna kavatseb Mee minna küünlatootmisettevõttesse ise ja toetada oma viit last, kuid ta väljendas vajadust õppida kõigepealt inglise keelt.<br/><br/>"Tai põgenikelaagris oli meil haridus, kuid see ei olnud nii hea," ütles Mee. "Kui ma olin laps, tahtsin ma kooli minna, kuid mulle öeldi, et ma jääksin koju, sest ma olin naine. Nüüd on mul lootused, et mu tütred lähevad kolledžisse ja saavad arstideks või politseinikeks," jätkas Mee.<br/><br/>Mee on saavutanud oma elus tasakaalu, mida ta soovib, et teised oleksid leidnud - lihtne, õnnelik elu, kus tööl, pereliikmete eest hoolitsemisel ja valikuvabadusel on kõigil oma koht.<br/><br/>Põgenike toetamine USA-s<br/><br/>Jaga seda emadepäeva lugu oma lähedastega. Ja kui ostate käsitsi valmistatud küünlaid Mee, Moo Kho ja Naw, teine Birma põgenik naine, kes töötab Heaolu küünal, tean, et aitate toetada nende elatist, kui nad taastavad oma elu ja nende pereliikmete elusid Ameerika Ühendriikides. |
| The Precedency Essay<br/><br/>1562 words - 7 pages<br/><br/>Affirmative action is a government policy that gives opportunities to minorities, women, and any group who has been the victim of discrimination in the past. Affirmative action is the outcome of the 1960's Civil Rights movement, growing out of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 which outlawed discrimination based on race, ethnicity, or gender. It was the 1978 Supreme Court decision, The Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, which allowed for the use of race-based preferences as a means of fostering diversity, allowing affirmative action to be used in admissions policies. It was created with the intention to provide equal opportunities for members of minority groups in education and ...view middle of the document...<br/><br/>However, according to a 2007 report by the Pew Research Center, support for affirmative action among the American public has actually increased substantiallyin recent years, climbing from 58% in 1995 to 70% in 2007. Supporters of affirmative action make many arguments in support of affirmative action, in the hopes of getting others to see the genuine good that affirmative actin policies bring to our society. Supporters believe that affirmative action is more of a process rather than an admissions policy. Colleges and universities take the extra initiative to reach out to minority groups, encouraging them to apply. Colleges and universities offer additional financial aid and provide on-campus resources to help better the student's college education. Supporters also note the rising number of minority applications to colleges and universities due in part to affirmative action policies.<br/>Statistics have proven that when affirmative action is eliminated, such as when it was at Berkley College and UCLA in 1998, the minority student admissions fell 61 percent and 36 percent respectively, proving that affirmative action plays a major role in a minority students college admissions process. Affirmative action supporters also believe that diversity in higher education provides a better educational atmosphere for all students, personally and intellectually. If affirmative action were to be eliminated, there would be fewer minority students enrolled in colleges, causing diversity to be fairly slim. Affirmative action policies are also necessary in order to compensate for centuries of racial, economic, and social oppression. Individuals with a higher socioeconomic status have more opportunities than those of lower socioeconomic backgrounds. Supporters believe that certain racial or ethnic groups are disadvantaged because they are frequently in lower income households and consequently are not exposed to the same resources as students from higher socioeconomic classes. Advocates support the notion of competition between students based on merit, but argue that affirmative action compensates for economic differences. College graduates, who have benefitted from affirmative action, have also said that they received better jobs, earned more money, and overall live better lives because of the fortunate opportunities they received through affirmative action.<br/>Supporters of affirmative action continuously stress the severe importance of affirmative action, considering its contributions to enhancing both the college experience and society in general. However, opponents of affirmative action believe that the time has come to end affirmative action. Opponents believe affirmative action was created to ensure fair admission practices to bring change to a long period of racial discrimination. They believe the policy is outdated."It's time to pull the plug on race-based decision making," says Ward Connerly, a Sacramento, California businessman and lead organizer of...<br/><br/>Find Another Essay On The Precedency<br/><br/>754 words - 4 pages<br/>of the burden to continue prospering.

This tone ventures farther across that thin line as she writes about the great female Queen Elizabeth | Pretsedentsuse essee<br/><br/>1562 sõna - 7 lehekülge<br/><br/>Positiivne tegevus on valitsuse poliitika, mis annab võimalusi vähemustele, naistele ja mis tahes rühmale, kes on minevikus diskrimineerimise ohvriks langenud. Positiivne tegevus on 1960. aastate kodanikuõiguste liikumise tulemus, mis kasvas välja 1964. aasta kodanikuõiguste seadusest, mis keelas diskrimineerimise rassi, etnilise kuuluvuse või soo alusel. See oli 1978. aasta ülemkohtu otsus, California ülikooli Regents v. Bakke, mis võimaldas rassil põhinevate eelistuste kasutamist mitmekesisuse edendamise vahendina, võimaldades jaatavat tegevust kasutada vastuvõtupoliitikas. See loodi eesmärgiga pakkuda vähemusrühmade liikmetele võrdseid võimalusi hariduses ja ... vaata dokumendi keskosas...<br/><br/>Kuid Pew Research Centeri 2007. aasta aruande kohaselt on Ameerika avalikkuse toetus positiivsele tegevusele viimastel aastatel oluliselt kasvanud, tõustes 58% -lt 1995. aastal 70% -ni 2007. aastal. Jagava tegevuse toetajad esitavad jaatava tegevuse toetuseks palju argumente, lootuses, et teised näevad tõelist head, mida jaatav tegevuspoliitika meie ühiskonnale toob. Toetajad usuvad, et jaatav tegevus on pigem protsess kui vastuvõtupoliitika. Kolledžid ja ülikoolid võtavad lisaalgatuse, et jõuda vähemusrühmadeni, julgustades neid taotlema. Kolledžid ja ülikoolid pakuvad täiendavat rahalist abi ja pakuvad ülikoolilinnaku ressursse, et aidata õpilase kolledži haridust paremini. Toetajad märgivad ka, et kolledžitele ja ülikoolidele esitatud vähemustaotluste arv kasvab osaliselt positiivsete meetmete tõttu.<br/>Statistika on tõestanud, et kui jaatav tegevus on kõrvaldatud, näiteks kui see oli Berkley College ja UCLA 1998. aastal, vähemuse üliõpilaste vastuvõtu langes vastavalt 61 protsenti ja 36 protsenti, mis tõestab, et jaatav tegevus mängib olulist rolli vähemuse üliõpilaste kolledži vastuvõtu protsessi. Positiivse tegevuse toetajad usuvad ka, et kõrghariduse mitmekesisus pakub kõigile õpilastele paremat hariduslikku õhkkonda nii isiklikult kui ka intellektuaalselt. Kui jaatav tegevus oleks kõrvaldatud, oleks vähem vähemusüliõpilasi kolledžites, põhjustades mitmekesisuse üsna õhuke. Kinnitav tegevuspoliitika on vajalik ka selleks, et kompenseerida sajandeid kestnud rassilist, majanduslikku ja sotsiaalset rõhumist. Kõrgema sotsiaalmajandusliku staatusega inimestel on rohkem võimalusi kui madalama sotsiaalmajandusliku taustaga inimestel. Toetajad usuvad, et teatud rassilised või etnilised rühmad on ebasoodsas olukorras, kuna nad on sageli madalama sissetulekuga leibkondades ja seetõttu ei puutu nad kokku samade ressurssidega kui kõrgemate sotsiaalmajanduslike klasside õpilased. Advokaadid toetavad õpilastevahelise konkurentsi kontseptsiooni, mis põhineb teenetel, kuid väidavad, et jaatav tegevus kompenseerib majanduslikke erinevusi. Kolledži lõpetajad, kes on saanud jaatavaid meetmeid, on ka öelnud, et nad said paremaid töökohti, teenisid rohkem raha ja üldiselt elavad paremat elu tänu õnnelikele võimalustele, mida nad said jaatavate meetmete kaudu.<br/>Positiivse tegevuse toetajad rõhutavad pidevalt positiivse tegevuse tõsist tähtsust, arvestades selle panust nii kolledži kogemuse kui ka ühiskonna üldisemasse parandamisse. Kuid jaatava tegevuse vastased usuvad, et on tulnud aeg jaatava tegevuse lõpetamiseks. Vastased usuvad, et jaatav tegevus loodi, et tagada õiglane vastuvõtupraktika, et muuta rassilise diskrimineerimise pikka aega. Nad usuvad, et poliitika on aegunud."

Klõpsake nuppu Redigeeri, seejärel klõpsake nuppu Peida aasta ja salvestage.<br/><br/>Nii lihtne see ongi!<br/><br/>Märkus.: Isik, kelle sünniaasta on eemaldatud, ei ilmu üheski aruandes vanusekriteeriumide kohta ja on klassifitseeritud täiskasvanuks, sest nende sünniaeg on tegelikult määratud 1902! Sünnikuupäeva välja leiate tavaliselt teabeosast, kuid teie administraator võis selle teise vahekaardi alla teisaldada. |
| Combinations<br/><br/>Combinations Are defenses against a punch, choreographed responses to different types of attacks. They have many names across the martial arts but (in my experience) every art has a version of them. This makes them different than forms because there are plenty of martial arts that have no forms. What makes there partner exercises so universal? Why practice a specific response when (in reality) timing, type of attack, size of the attacker, and a hundred other factors will make it so you never use that entire choreographed response? And finally, how can we practice for a real defense situation and avoid injury at the same time?<br/><br/>The universality of combinations is impressive, to say the least. Our style of Kenpo karate has a list of 108 combos that can be learned. (Most students only learn 20-30 though) In Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu you spend whole classes practicing arm bars and chokes, learning every subtlety to the move while your partner offers little to no resistance. Every boxer has spent hours in front of the bag and/or mirror throwing the same combination of punches until their body moves by reflex alone. Combinations are universal because we have no better way to introduce movement and then practice the subtle positions required to make them work. Hitting a small pressure point through clothing takes A LOT of practice, catching an arm bar with control requires a carefully placed hip and a sneaky setup, and a great combination is only useful if you can through it from a balanced and protected position. Can you think of a better way to gain these skills?<br/><br/>There is any number of factors that determine how you respond to an attack and whether in a sparring match or in a fight, I have NEVER used a full combination in my defense. Why, then, do we spend hours practicing them? We practice these choreographed responses because the objective is not to pull combination 8 out every time you see a hook punch but to show you one way of blocking it and then a possible way to follow it up. I have never chosen to use combination 3 in a reality situation but the block is one of my go-to moves. Combinations add tools to the toolbox they do not fix the car.<br/><br/>The last question is a question of safety. If we practice for the sake of reality we need to replicate reality. How do we prevent injury while doing so? When it comes down to it, it's about building trust. We start slow and learn to trust that we have control over ourselves. We learn to trust our partners have control as well. In more time we learn to trust our control over our partner and (a little scarier) we learn to trust our partner's control over us. In the end (with a lot of practice) you can move are full speed, tossing your partner, and being thrown without fear of injury.<br/><br/>Combinations are universal for a reason; they are practiced so they can be dissected into their parts, and we stay safe by starting slow and building trust. As with everything else in the martial arts, combinations have many reasons behind their practice and execution. | Kombinatsioonid<br/><br/>Kombinatsioonid on kaitse löökide vastu, koreografeeritud vastused erinevatele rünnakutele. Neil on palju nimesid kogu võitluskunstides, kuid (minu kogemus) igal kunstil on neist versioon. See muudab need erinevad vormid, sest seal on palju võitluskunste, mis ei ole vorme. Mis teeb seal partner harjutusi nii universaalne? Miks harjutada konkreetset vastust, kui (tegelikult) ajastus, rünnaku tüüp, ründaja suurus ja sada muud tegurit muudavad selle nii, et te ei kasuta kunagi kogu koreograafilist vastust? Ja lõpuks, kuidas me saame harjutada tõelist kaitseolukorda ja vältida samal ajal vigastusi?<br/><br/>Kombinatsioonide universaalsus on muljetavaldav. Meie Kenpo karate stiilis on 108 kombot, mida saab õppida. (Enamik õpilasi ainult õppida 20-30 kuigi) Brasiilia Jiu-Jitsu veedate terve klassi harjutamine käsivarred ja kägistamine, õppides iga peensusi liikuda, samas kui teie partner pakub vähe mingit vastupanu. Iga poksija on veetnud tunde koti ja / või peegli ees, visates sama löögikombinatsiooni, kuni nende keha liigub ainult refleks. Kombinatsioonid on universaalsed, sest meil ei ole paremat viisi liikumise tutvustamiseks ja seejärel nende toimimiseks vajalike peenete positsioonide harjutamiseks. Väikese rõhupunkti löömine läbi riiete võtab PALJU harjutamist, käevarre püüdmine kontrolliga nõuab hoolikalt paigutatud puusa ja salakaval seadistust ning suurepärane kombinatsioon on kasulik ainult siis, kui saate selle läbi tasakaalustatud ja kaitstud asendist. Kas on võimalik leida paremat viisi nende oskuste omandamiseks?<br/><br/>On mitmeid tegureid, mis määravad, kuidas sa reageerid rünnakule ja kas sparramises mängus või võitluses, pole ma kunagi kasutanud täielikku kombinatsiooni oma kaitseks. Miks me siis kulutame tunde nende harjutamiseks? Me harjutame neid koreograafilisi vastuseid, sest eesmärk ei ole tõmmata kombinatsiooni 8 iga kord, kui näete konksu punchi, vaid näidata teile ühte viisi selle blokeerimiseks ja seejärel võimalikku viisi selle jälgimiseks. Ma ei ole kunagi otsustanud kasutada kombinatsiooni 3 reaalses olukorras, kuid plokk on üks minu go-to liigub. Kombinatsioonid lisada tööriistu tööriistakasti nad ei paranda auto.<br/><br/>Viimane küsimus on ohutuse küsimus. Kui me praktiseerime reaalsuse nimel, peame me reaalsust jäljendama. Kuidas me seda tehes vigastusi ära hoiame? Kui see jõuab selleni, on see usalduse loomine. Alustame aeglaselt ja õpime usaldama, et meil on kontroll enda üle. Õpime usaldama ka oma partnereid. Rohkem aega õpime usaldama oma partnerit ja (veidi hirmutavamalt) õpime usaldama oma partneri kontrolli meie üle. Lõpuks (palju praktikat) saab liikuda on täiskiirusel, viskamine oma partneri ja visatakse ilma hirmu vigastusi.<br/><br/>Kombinatsioonid on universaalsed põhjusega; neid praktiseeritakse, et neid saaks osadeks jagada, ja me jääme ohutuks, alustades aeglaselt ja luues usaldust. Nagu kõige muu võitluskunstide puhul, on kombinatsioonidel nende praktika ja täitmise taga palju põhjuseid. |
