Undocumented migrants have nothing. They are not allowed to work. They have no right to state benefits nor to a place to live. They are unseen and potentially the most vulnerable group in the UK today.<br/><br/>Undocumented (or irregular) migrants include those trafficked into the sex trade or for domestic servitude; they include visa overstayers; those whose asylum applications have been refused and others who have been subject to failures in the immigration system. All of these may originally have come to the UK legally.<br/><br/>'Illegal immigrants' – those imagined to have entered the country in the backs of lorries – make up a small proportion of the undocumented.<br/><br/>Indeed some sources suggest that half the estimated 120,000 undocumented children in the UK were actually born here to undocumented parents. These children are disadvantaged from birth, solely by their immigration status.<br/><br/>The blog tells the stories of the undocumented. It highlights their daily struggles and vulnerabilities, but also their strength and resilience. It's not an easy read.<br/><br/>You can access the blog via our website (bottom of right hand column on Home Page).<br/><br/>The blog has won the online category of the Speaking Together media awards. The awards were a new addition this year to the Migrant and Refugee Woman of the Year Awards celebration at the Royal Festival Hall in London as part of International Women's Day. The panel of judges – including novelist and playwright Gillian Slovo, and journalist and author, Hannah Pool – was particularly looking for work that challenged myths and stereotypes.<br/><br/>The blog has also won the Blog North Awards 2013 in the Best Writing category and was also shortlisted for an Amnesty International Media Award. | Postituse navigeerimine<br/><br/>"Elu ilma paberiteta" võitis parima kirjandusauhinna<br/><br/>Blogiprojekt "Elu ilma dokumentideta", mille on loonud Len Grant, sisaldab lugusid dokumenteerimata sisserändajate perekondadest ja noortest. Dokumenteerimata sisserändajatel ei ole midagi. Neil ei ole lubatud töötada. Neil ei ole õigust riiklikele hüvitistele ega elukohale. Nad on praegu Ühendkuningriigis nähtamatud ja potentsiaalselt kõige haavatavamad rühmad.<br/><br/>Dokumenteerimata (või ebaseaduslike) rändajate hulka kuuluvad need, kes kaubitsevad seksikaubanduse või kodumaise teenistuse eesmärgil; nende hulka kuuluvad viisa üleviijad; need, kelle varjupaigataotlused on tagasi lükatud, ja teised, kelle sisserändesüsteem on läbi kukkunud. Kõik need võivad olla algselt saabunud Ühendkuningriigisse seaduslikult.<br/><br/>Ebaseaduslikud sisserändajad – need, kes arvati sisenevat riiki veoautodega – moodustavad väikese osa dokumentideta sisserändajatest.<br/><br/>Tõepoolest, mõned allikad viitavad sellele, et pooled hinnanguliselt 120 000 dokumenteerimata lapsest Ühendkuningriigis on tegelikult sündinud siin dokumenteerimata vanematele. Need lapsed on sünnist alates ebasoodsas olukorras, ainuüksi nende sisserände staatuse tõttu.<br/><br/>Blogi räägib lugusid dokumenteerimata. See toob esile nende igapäevast võitlust ja haavatavust, vaid ka nende tugevust ja vastupidavust. See ei ole lihtne lugeda.<br/><br/>Blogile pääsete ligi meie veebilehe kaudu (parema käe veeru alt koduleheküljel).<br/><br/>Blogi on võitnud veebikategooria Speaking Together meediaauhinnad.

| Sabbath School Lesson<br/><br/>In Galatians, Paul tackles issues such as freedom, the role of the law in salvation, our condition in Christ, and the nature of the Spirit-led life, as well as the age-old question, How can sinful humans be made right before a holy and just God?<br/><br/>Many scholars believe that Galatians may be the earliest of Paul's letters. It was written in A.D. 49, shortly after the famous Jerusalem Council (Acts 15). Therefore, the book may be the oldest Christian document known. As Acts and Galatians make clear, the early church found itself in a fierce battle over the nature of salvation, especially in the case of Gentiles. According to a group of Jewish believers, known as Judaizers, belief in Jesus alone was not good enough for Gentiles. Gentiles must also be circumcised and follow the laws of Moses (Acts 15:1).<br/><br/>This quarter's Bible study guide invites us to journey with the apostle Paul as he pleads with the Galatians to remain true to Jesus. It also gives us a chance to reflect on our own understanding of the truths that opened the way for Martin Luther's ultimate break with Rome and the restoration of the biblical gospel. | Sabatikooli õppetund<br/><br/>Galaatlastes käsitleb Paulus selliseid küsimusi nagu vabadus, seaduse roll päästes, meie seisund Kristuses ja Vaimu juhitud elu olemus, samuti iidne küsimus: kuidas saab patuseid inimesi püha ja õiglase Jumala ees õigeks teha?<br/><br/>Paljud õpetlased usuvad, et galaatlased võivad olla Pauluse kirjadest vanimad. See kirjutati AD 49is, varsti pärast kuulsat Jeruusalemma nõukogu (Apostlite teod 15). Seetõttu võib raamat olla vanim teadaolev kristlik dokument. Nagu Apostlite teod ja galaatlased selgitavad, leidis varajane kirik end ägedas võitluses päästmise olemuse üle, eriti paganate puhul. Vastavalt juutide usklike rühmale, keda tuntakse judaistidena, ei olnud usk Jeesusesse paganatele piisav. Paganad tuleb ka ümber lõigata ja järgida Moosese seadusi (Apostlite teod 15:1).<br/><br/>Selle kvartali piibliuurimise juhend kutsub meid reisima koos apostel Paulusega, kui ta palub galaatlastel jääda ustavaks Jeesusele. Samuti annab see meile võimaluse mõtiskleda selle üle, kuidas me mõistame tõdesid, mis avasid tee Martin Lutheri lõplikule lahkulöömisele Roomast ja Piibli evangeeliumi taastamisele. |

Franz Frederick Karl Ludwig Georg Heinrich, Frederick Wilhelm Karl Joseph Ludwig Georg. Friedrichit peeti populaarseks ja intelligentseks, tema valitsemise ajal koos oma ilusa naise Charlotte'iga jõudis kultuurielu väikelinnas oma tippu. Nii palju luuletajaid ja kunstnikke veetis seal aega, et Hildburghausen sai hüüdnimeks Klein-Weimar, kui viimane Saksi-Gotha-Altenburgi hertsog suri 1825. aastal ilma probleemideta, otsustasid maja teised harud Ernestiinide hertsogkondade ümberkorraldamise. 12. novembril 1826 sai Friedrichist Saksi-Altenburgi hertsog, kellele ta andis 1831. aastal esimese põhiseaduse, vastutasuks meediale, mis oli seotud Saksi-Altenburgi hertsogi Friedrichiga Wikimedia Commonsis.<br/><br/>Friedrich, Saksi-Altenburgi hertsog<br/>−<br/>Frederick<br/><br/>15 .<br/>Mecklenburg-Strelitzi hertsoginna Charlotte Georgine<br/>−<br/>Charlotte Georgine sündis Hannoveris, Braunschweig-Lüneburgi kuurvürstkonnas. Ta oli Charles II, Mecklenburgi suurhertsogi vanim laps ja tütar, Charlotte ja tema õed, Preisimaa kuninganna Louise, Hannoveri kuninganna Frederica ja Thurn und Taxise printsess Therese peeti oma aja kõige ilusamateks naisteks. Jean Paul Friedrich Richter pühendas oma romaani "Titan" neljale ilusale, Charlotte kasvas üles Hannoveris, kus tema isa teenis kubernerina oma õemehe, Ühendkuningriigi kuninga George III nimel, kes elas Londonis. Kui Charlotte oli kaksteist aastat vana, tema ema suri ja ta oli üles kasvanud tema ema õde, Charlotte, kes abiellus tema isa 1784 ja tema õed olid toonud tema vanaema, Maria Louise Albertine Leiningen-Falkenburg-Dagsburg Darmstadt. 3. septembril 1785 abiellus Charlotte 15-aastaselt Saksi-Altenburgi hertsogi hertsogi Frederickuga, abielu ei olnud õnnelik, Charlotte oli vaimselt parem kui Frederick, kes hakkas teda ignoreerima. Neil oli ka probleeme, Saksi-Hildburghausen oli rahaliselt hävitanud katastroofiline poliitika Fredericks eelkäijad. Saajad lubasid hertsogile ja hertsoginnale ainult vähendatud tsiviilnimekirja, Charlotte'i isa ja kaks venda jäid sageli Charlotte'iga Hildburghausenisse. 1787. aastal kolis ta jäädavalt Hildburghausenisse ja sai krediidikomitee esimeheks. Aastal 1792 põgenesid Charlotte'i vanaema ja tema õed Darmstadtist Hildburghausenisse edasijõudnud Prantsuse armee eest ja tema vanaema märkas Charlotte'i abikaasat. Kõigist oma kohustustest täidab ta oma abielukohustusi innukalt. Charlotte, kes ei ole kunagi armastanud seda meest, on alati rase, pere veetis mitu muretut nädalat Hildburghausenis. Aastal 1793 naasis Charlotte'i vanaema pagendusest ja reisis koos Charlotte'i õdedega Frankfurt am Maini, Charlotte'il oli väga intiimne ja armastav suhe oma õe Friederike ja sugulastega Strelitzis. Aastatel 1803 ja 1805 külastas Preisi kuninglik paar Hildburghausenit, sel korral lubasid vastuvõtjad hertsogipaaril osa oma mööblit uuendada. Louise oli aidanud koostada sõjakuulutust, kristlane Truchseß von Wetzhausen zu Bettenburg oli hertsogipaari sõber ja Charlotte'i poja Edwardi ristiisa. Paljud pealtvaatajad olid tulnud Baieri kroonprintsessi vaatama, kui Truchseß oma külalisi vastu võttis, püüdis ta esimesena viia madalama auastmega Charlotte'i oma lossi, kuid ta keeldus, viidates oma tütrele. Truchseß vastas: "Teie kõrgeausus andestab mulle, aga niikaua kui see loss on siin seisnud, haaras Therese parunitest teise käe ja kolm neist kõndisid koos läbi värava. Hertsoginna andis umbes poole oma sissetulekust vaestele, pensionäridele.<br/><br/>1617.<br/>Hessen-Kasseli prints Charles<br/>−<br/>Hessen-Kasseli prints Charles oli Hessen-Kasseli dünastia nooremliige ja Taani kindralmarssal. Taani õukonna sugulastega koos kasvades veetis ta suurema osa oma elust Taanis ja tema ema oli Suurbritannia kuninga George II ja Ansbachi Caroline'i tütar ning Taani kuninganna Louise'i õde. Tema isa, tulevane maakrahv, lahkus perekonnast 1747. aastal, 1755. aastal lõpetas ta ametlikult abielu Maarjaga. Vanaisa Wilhelm VIII, Hesseni maakrahv, andis Hanau krahvkonna ja selle tulud Maarjale, noorele Prints Charlesile ja tema kahele vennale, Wilhelm ja Friedrichile, kasvatas nende ema ja neid toetasid protestantlikud sugulased alates 1747. aastast. 1756. aastal kolis Mary Taani, et hoolitseda oma õe, Taani kuninganna Louise alaealiste laste eest. Koos temaga võttis ta oma pojad, kes kasvasid üles Kopenhaageni Christiansborgi lossi õukonnas. Hesseni vürstid jäid hiljem Taani, saades selle tähtsateks isandateks, ainult vanim vend William naasis 1785. aastal Hessenisse, kui ta tõusis maakrahvkonnaks. Karl alustas karjääri Taanis. Aastal 1758 nimetati ta kolonel, vanuses 20 kindralmajor, samuti aastal 1766 nimetati ta kindralkuberner Norra, seisukoht ta pidas kuni 1768, kuid mis jäi enamasti tiitli, sest ta kunagi läks Norra sel perioodil. 1763. aastal abiellus tema vanem vend William nende esimese nõoga, Charles järgis 30. augustil 1766 Christiansborgi palees - tema naine oli Taani Louise ja Charles sai seega oma nõo, kuningas Christian VII, vennaks. Abielu toimus vaatamata sellele, et prints Charles süüdistas teda ebamoraalsuses. Varsti pärast seda langes Charles õukonnas ebasoodsasse olukorda ja 1767. aasta alguses said tema ja nad oma esimese lapse, Marie Sophie, seal 1767. aastal ja seejärel nende teise lapse, William, 1769. aastal. Aastal 1768 ostis Karl Edelsheimi perekonnalt Offenbach-Rumpenheimi vara ja küla. Aastal 1771 laiendas ta mõisa lossiks ja vürstlikuks istmeks ning tema ema Maarja elas palees kuni oma surmani 1772. aastal. Aastal 1781 müüs Charles Rumpenheimi palee oma nooremale vennale, Charles asus oma perega elama Schleswigis asuvasse Gottorpi lossi. Neil oli seal kolmas laps Friedrich aastal 1771, aastal 1770 andis kuningas Christian VII oma õele Schleswigi linna ja Eckernförde vahele Gübys Tegelhofi mõisa. Aastatel 1772–1776 oli Charlesil suvekodu ehitatud kohas, mille ta nimetas Louisenlundiks oma naise auks, 1772. aasta septembris nimetati Charles Norra armee ülemjuhatajaks ja ta ja Louise kolisid Christianasse. Ülesanne oli Rootsi kuninga Gustav III riigipöörde tagajärg 19. augustil 1772, samal ajal kui Norras sünnitas printsess Louise 1773. aastal oma neljanda lapse Juliane'i.<br/><br/>18 .<br/>Louise Caroline Hessen-Kassel<br/>−<br/>Louise Caroline sündis Gottorpis Schleswigi hertsogkonnas maakrahv Charles Hessen-Kasselile ja tema naisele Taani printsess Louise'ile.

Teda peetakse Casa dEste asutajaks, olles olnud esimese Este perepea, oli Alberto Azzo II Milano markkrahvi Albert Azzo I ainus poeg. Ta päris oma isa bürood umbes 1020. aastal ja suurendas pidevalt oma vara Põhja-Itaalias, aastatel 1069–1070 püüdis ta oma pojale Hughile Maine'i omandada, sest tema naine Garsende oli varasemate Maine'i krahvkondade abikaasa. Hugh kuulutati krahviks, kuid ta ei suutnud võita Normandia hertsogi Roberti vastu investituurivaidluses Saksa-Rooma keisri Heinrich IV ja paavst Gregorius VII vahel, Azzo püüdis vahendada, kuid hiljem ühines ta paavsti poolel. Umbes 1073 tegi ta oma elukohaks Este lossi, millest Este maja, enne tema ehitusprojekti, oli veidi rohkem kui küla. Tema poeg Welf kolis kõigepealt Kärntenisse ja seejärel Baierisse, mille tulemusena sündis üks Euroopa ajaloo tähtsamaid perekondi, teine poeg, Fulk I Milanost, kasutas esimest dokumenteeritud tiitlit Marquis dEste. Azzo II abiellus Altdorfi krahv Welf II tütre Kunigundega ja neil oli üks teadaolev laps, Welfi hertsog aastatel 1070–1077 ja aastast 1096 kuni oma surmani, kes oli Welfi haru esimene liige Este dünastiast. Tema teine abielu oli Garsende, tütar Herbert I, krahv Maine ja neil oli järgmised tuntud pojad, Fulco I, markkrahv Milano, esivanem Itaalia filiaali House of Este Hugh V, krahv Maine, ei olnud küsimus. Mõned allikad ütlevad, et ta abiellus ka Vitalia Orseologa, Peter Orseolo tütrega ja tal oli abieluväline suhe Padova piiskopi Williami õega Matildaga, kellega tal oli tütar nimega Adelasia, kes abiellus Guglielmo Adelardiga.

Ta oli Este dünastia Welfide haru esimene liige, Welfide vanema dünastia genealoogias loetakse teda Welfiks IV. Welf oli Este Azzo II ja tema naise Kunigunde poeg, kui Welfi ema onu Welf, Kärnteni hertsog, suri ilma lasteta, Welf päris tema vara. Welf abiellus Baieri hertsogi Otto II tütre Ethelinde'iga, kui tema äi Otto oli saanud kuningas Henry IV vaenlaseks ja loobus oma hertsogkonnast, Welf jäi kuningale ustavaks. Vastavalt Henry käskudele ta salgas ja lahutas oma hertsoginna Ethelinde ja see sündmus toimus Goslaris aastal 1070, kui Baieri riigid alistusid vaikselt vastvalitud hertsogile, kes esindas üht provintsi vanimaid perekondi. Tema keeldumine hertsoginnast, mida oleks võinud pidada ebaõiglaseks. Paavst ja keiser leppisid 1076. aastal pealiskaudselt kokku, kuid aastal nägid nad taas aktiivset vaenutegevust. Henry kuulutas korduvate mässuliste tegude tagajärjel Welfi troonilt tõugatuks oma äsja omandatud hertsogkonnas. Kuid Welfi toetasid tema ustavad baierlased ja teda aitas tema isa Itaalias, kuid Gregorius suri aastal 1085 ja tema järglased võtsid vähem intensiivse osa Saksamaa asjadest. Welf, kuigi kuulus endiselt kiriku parteisse, abiellus pärast lahutust oma esimesest naisest aastal 1070 Flandria krahv Baldwin IV tütre Judithiga ja Northumbria krahv Tostig Godwinsoni lesega. Aastal 1089 abiellus Welfi poeg Welfiga Matilda Toscanast, tugevdades seeläbi suhteid paavstiga, kuid pärast seda, kui noorem Welf lahutas Matildast aastal 1095, tegi Welf kompensatsiooni kuningas Henry IV-ga ja kinnitati uuesti Baieri hertsogiks. Pärast oma isa Azzo surma aastal 1097 püüdis Welf oma isade vara Alpidest lõunas omandada, aastal 1099 ühines Welf sellega, mis sai tuntuks kui ristisõda aastal 1101, koos Akvitaania Wilhelm IX-ga, Vermandoisi Hugh'ga ja Austria Idaga. Tema peamine edu oli vältida kokkupõrget teiste ristisõdijate vahel, kes olid rüüstanud Bütsantsi territooriumi teel Konstantinoopolisse, Welf ise põgenes fiaskost, kuid suri teel tagasi Paphosesse Küprosele aastal 1101 ja maeti Weingarteni kloostrisse.

Noormehena haldas ta Este peresid Alpidest lõunas, abielludes umbes aastal 1095 Saksimaa hertsog Magnuse tütre Wulfhildega, omandas ta osa Billungi mõisatest Lüneburgi ümbruses. Ta püüdis saada oma äia järeltulijaks sakside hertsogiks, kui Magnus suri 1106. aastal ilma pärijateta. Hertsog Henry säilitas siiski tihedad suhted valitseva Salia dünastiaga, aastal 1116 ühines ta keiser Heinrich V teise Itaalia kampaaniaga, et hõivata hilise Toscana markkrahvinna Matilda valdused. Ta järgnes oma vanemale vennale Welf II-le kui Baieri hertsogile, kui viimane suri 1120. aastal lastetuna, oli Henryl samuti oluline roll 1122. aasta ussikonkordaadi loomisel, lõpetades kauakestva investituurivaidluse paavsti ja keisri vahel. Abielu sõlmiti mais 1127, võõrandumine Welfi ja Hohenstaufeni dünastiate vahel kestis kuni 13. sajandini. Pärast valimiste võitmist kehtestas Lothar siiski keiserliku keelu Friedrich II-le. Henry suri varsti pärast seda ja maeti Weingartenis ja tema naine Wulfhilde elas teda ainult 16 päeva.

Mõlemad sõlmisid abielu kevadel 1202, millega kaasnes märkimisväärne kaasavara ja nende ainus laps oli Otto, kes päris oma isa vara ja sai aastal 1235 esimeseks Braunschweig-Lüneburgi hertsogiks.

| Follow Us<br/><br/>ARE YOU AN<br/><br/>INSIDER<br/><br/>Craving Sugar? Here's What Your Body Is Trying to Tell You<br/><br/>by<br/>Byrdie<br/><br/>PHOTO:<br/><br/>Jacquemus<br/><br/>Weight gain from out-of-control cravings aside, it can be frustrating to have a constant hankering for something unhealthy and not know why. The good news is that there's usually a reason underlying that burning desire to house a bag of potato chips, or the feeling that you might actually die if you don't get a pickle rightthisinstant (even though you're not pregnant). If you're having visions of Milky Way bars, for example, it could mean that you're missing a very specific nutrient in your diet. (Yup—it's more complicated than said chocolate bar being so darn delicious.)<br/><br/>We talked to Los Angeles–based dietitian Shira Lenchewski, M.S., R.D., to get the skinny on some common food cravings, as well as what you can do to satiate the hunger without going overboard. Keep scrolling for some seriously good information!<br/><br/>If you're craving chocolate<br/><br/>It means: You could be lacking magnesium in your diet, says Lenchewski. "Magnesium is an essential mineral involved in energy production, glucose metabolism, and muscle function. This is especially true for those hitting the gym hard," she explains. Additionally, magnesium levels lower during the pre-menstrual weeks of your period, which explains why PMS so often comes with chocolate cravings.<br/><br/>Instead, reach for high-quality, low-sugar dark chocolate, which is naturally high in magnesium. "I recommend sticking to 75 per cent cocoa or higher, and pairing it with another magnesium-rich source like sunflower seeds," says Lenchewski. She suggests the chocolate brand Hu, a small-batch food company that focuses on high-quality ingredients produced locally. "It's a little pricey, but all the more reason to keep portions in check," she says. "It's my personal favourite." We're also big fans of superfood-packed Zenbunni.<br/><br/>If you're craving candy<br/><br/>It means: "Craving pure sugar is a good indication that you're running low on energy," says Lenchewski. "Think about it. What is the one thing you're itching for after a terrible night's sleep or at around 4 p.m. during a stressful workday? The answer is usually sugar because it's used as instant fuel for our body's cells."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for apples with nut butter. "If you're raiding your co-workers' candy stash, I recommend a more slow-burn carbohydrate with a source of fat or protein," says Lenchewski. "Unlike simple sugar, this will fuel your cells while avoiding the post-sugar crash. Two options that make for great pick-me-ups the next time you're craving candy: a sliced apple with your choice of nut butter, or berries with 2% unsweetened Greek yoghurt." We like quashing a sweet tooth with these addictive coconut chips, too—they're filling, free of any added sugar, and just so good.<br/><br/>If you're craving salt<br/><br/>It means: "If nothing but the saltiest pickle will do, you may not be drinking enough H2O," says Lenchewski. "Salt helps the body hold on to water, so we crave it when we're in need of fluids."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for water. "Stay hydrated, especially as we approach the summer months," she says. The next time a craving hits, try quenching it (literally) with a few refreshing glasses and you might find the urgency to sodium binge disappears. "If plain water bores you, try adding in mint, lemon, or frozen fruit to mix it up," says Lenchewski. And if that still doesn't do the trick, there's a healthier alternative to bagged chips or fries. "If you're really just craving salt after all, toasted seaweed is a great low-calorie option," she says.<br/><br/>If you're craving starchy carbs like pasta<br/><br/>It means: "Because high-carb foods boost the feel-good hormone serotonin, starch cravings can be a sign you're in need of a mood booster," says Lenchewski.<br/><br/>Instead, reach for a bath! "Bust out the Epsom salts, because it's time for some serious R+R," says Lenchewski. "Trust me. Indulging in a starch free-for-all feels really good in the moment, but it will likely bum you out more the next day." (As anyone who has ever over-indulged a pizza or pasta craving knows.) So the next time you want to dive head first into a bowl of carbs, draw a bath, light a candle, and treat yourself without any regret or dense calories.<br/><br/>If you're craving ice cream<br/><br/>5 / 6<br/><br/>It means: "Your body may be telling you it's in need of some healthy fat."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for coconut ice cream. "I'm a realist, so if you're craving ice cream, I'm not going to recommend a handful of walnuts, which are, of course, full of healthy fat," says Lenchewski. "For ice cream emergencies, I recommend lower-in-sugar coconut ice-creams like Coconut Bliss or Kippy's three-ingredient ice cream in Los Angeles." We can vouch for the fact that coconut ice cream tastes incredible and just like the real thing.<br/><br/>If you're craving a burger<br/><br/>It means: You need iron. "If you can't stop thinking about red meat, there's a chance your body is craving iron, b12 and folic acid," says Lenchewski. "This is especially true during or around that time of the month."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for a healthier burger. "I'm a proponent of grass fed, antibiotic and hormone-free red meat once a week," says Lenchewski. "Try experimenting with an open-faced bison burger—which, cut for cut, is leaner and has more iron than beef." Don't eat meat? Try to incorporate some kind of plant-based iron supplement into your routine, like spirulina. | Jälgi meid<br/><br/>KAS OLED SINA?<br/><br/>INSIDER<br/><br/>Suhkru iha? Siin on see, mida teie keha püüab teile öelda<br/><br/>poolt<br/>Byrdie<br/><br/>FOTO:<br/><br/>Jacquemus<br/><br/>Kaalutõus kontrollimatu isu kõrvale, see võib olla masendav on pidev igatsus midagi ebatervislikku ja ei tea, miks. Hea uudis on see, et seal on tavaliselt põhjus, et põletamine soov majutada koti kartulikrõpsud, või tunne, et sa võid tegelikult surra, kui sa ei saa marineeritud rightthisinstant (isegi kui sa ei ole rase). Kui teil on näiteks nägemused Milky Way baaridest, võib see tähendada, et teil on oma dieedis väga spetsiifiline toitaine puudu. (Jah - see on keerulisem kui see, et šokolaadibatoon on nii kuradima maitsev.)<br/><br/>Me rääkisime Los Angeles-põhine dietoloog Shira Lenchewski, MS, RD, et saada kõhn mõned ühised toidu isu, samuti mida saab teha, et rahuldada nälga ilma üle parda. Hoidke kerides mõned tõsiselt head teavet!<br/><br/>Kui soovid šokolaadi<br/><br/>See tähendab: Teil võib olla magneesiumi puudumine oma dieedis, ütleb Lenchewski. "Magneesium on oluline mineraal, mis on seotud energiatootmise, glükoosi ainevahetuse ja lihaste funktsiooniga. See kehtib eriti nende kohta, kes löövad jõusaali kõvasti," selgitab ta. Lisaks on magneesiumi tase menstruatsioonieelsetel nädalatel madalam, mis selgitab, miks PMS nii sageli kaasneb šokolaadi isuga.<br/><br/>Selle asemel jõudke kvaliteetse, madala suhkruga tumeda šokolaadi juurde, mis on loomulikult kõrge magneesiumisisaldusega. "Ma soovitan kleepida 75 protsenti kakaod või kõrgemat ja siduda see teise magneesiumi rikkaliku allikaga nagu päevalilleseemned," ütleb Lenchewski. Ta soovitab šokolaadibrändi Hu, väikepartii toiduettevõte, mis keskendub kohapeal toodetud kvaliteetsetele koostisosadele. "See on natuke kallis, kuid seda enam on põhjust hoida portsjoneid kontrolli all," ütleb ta. "See on minu isiklik lemmik." Me oleme ka suured supertoidu pakitud Zenbunni fännid.<br/><br/>Kui sa ihaldad kommi<br/><br/>See tähendab: "Puhas suhkru otsimine on hea märk sellest, et teil on vähe energiat," ütleb Lenchewski. "Mõelge sellele. Mis on üks asi, mida te pärast kohutavat öösel magada või umbes kella 16 ajal stressirohke tööpäeva ajal sügelete? Vastus on tavaliselt suhkur, sest seda kasutatakse meie keha rakkude kiirkütusena. "<br/><br/>Selle asemel jõuate õunte juurde pähklivõiga. "Kui te rüüstate oma töökaaslaste kommide varjamist, soovitan aeglasemalt põletatud süsivesikuid rasva või valgu allikaga," ütleb Lenchewski. "Erinevalt lihtsast suhkrust toidab see teie rakke, vältides samal ajal suhkrujärgset krahhi. "Kaks võimalust, mis teevad suurepäraste pick-me-upide jaoks järgmine kord, kui ihaldate kommi: viilutatud õun oma valitud pähklivõiga või marjad 2% magustamata Kreeka jogurtiga." Meile meeldib magusa hamba purustamine nende sõltuvust tekitavate kookospähklikrõpsudega - nad täidavad, ilma lisatud suhkruta ja lihtsalt nii hea.<br/><br/>Kui sa ihaldad soola<br/><br/>See tähendab: "Kui midagi muud kui soolane marineeritud ei tee, ei pruugi te juua piisavalt H2O-d," ütleb Lenchewski. "Sool aitab kehal veest kinni hoida, nii et me ihaldame seda, kui me vajame vedelikke."<br/><br/>Selle asemel ulatuda vett. "Püsi hüdreeritud, eriti kui me läheneme suvekuudel," ütleb ta. Järgmine kord, kui isu tabab, proovige kustutada see (sõna otseses mõttes) paar värskendavat klaasi ja võite leida kiireloomulisuse naatriumi joomine kaob. "Kui tavaline vesi teid igavleb, proovige lisada piparmündi, sidruni või külmutatud puuviljade segamiseks," ütleb Lenchewski. Ja kui see ikka ei tee trikki, on kottidesse krõpsudele või friikartulitele tervislikum alternatiiv. "Kui sa tõesti ihaldad soola, on röstitud merevetikad suurepärane madala kalorsusega võimalus," ütleb ta.<br/><br/>Kui sa ihaldad tärklist sisaldavaid süsivesikuid nagu pasta<br/><br/>See tähendab: "Kuna kõrge süsivesikutesisaldusega toidud suurendavad hea enesetunde hormooni serotoniini, võib tärklise isu olla märk sellest, et vajate meeleolu võimendajat," ütleb Lenchewski.<br/><br/>Selle asemel haarake vanni! "Võtke Epsomi soolad välja, sest on aeg mõnda tõsist R + R-i," ütleb Lenchewski. "Usaldage mind. Tärklise vaba-kõik tundub hetkel tõesti hea, kuid see tõenäoliselt lööb teid järgmisel päeval rohkem." (Nagu igaüks, kes on kunagi pizzat või pastat ülekoormanud, teab.) Nii et järgmine kord, kui soovite sukelduda kõigepealt süsivesikute kaussi, tõmmake vanni, süüdake küünal ja ravige ennast ilma kahetsuseta või tihedate kaloriteta.<br/><br/>Kui sa ihaldad jäätist<br/><br/>5 / 6<br/><br/>See tähendab: "Teie keha võib teile öelda, et ta vajab tervislikku rasva."<br/><br/>Selle asemel haarake kookospähkli jäätis. "Ma olen realist, nii et kui sa ihkama jäätist, ma ei kavatse soovitada käputäis kreeka pähklid, mis on muidugi täis tervislikku rasva," ütleb Lenchewski. "Jäätise hädaolukordades soovitan madala suhkrusisaldusega kookospähkli jäätist, nagu Coconut Bliss või Kippy kolme koostisosaga jäätis Los Angeleses." Me võime garanteerida, et kookospähkli jäätis maitseb uskumatult ja just nagu tõeline asi.<br/><br/>Kui sa ihaldad burgerit<br/><br/>See tähendab: Teil on vaja rauda. "Kui te ei saa lõpetada punase liha mõtlemist, on võimalus, et teie keha ihaldab rauda, B12 ja foolhapet," ütleb Lenchewski. "See kehtib eriti selle kuu ajal või selle ümbruses."<br/><br/>Selle asemel jõuda tervislikuma burger. "Ma olen pooldaja rohu toidetud, antibiootikumide ja hormoonivaba punase liha üks kord nädalas," ütleb Lenchewski. "Püüa katsetada avatud nägu bison burger - mis lõigatud lõigatud, on õhem ja on rohkem rauda kui veiseliha." Ärge sööge liha? Püüdke lisada oma rutiinile mingi taimne raua lisand, nagu spirulina. |

Spoiler alert: This brain teaser is entirely solvable. Scroll down to read the puzzle, and to get the answer. Good luck!<br/><br/>Here's The Puzzle<br/><br/>Alice and Bob are each told a number, but neither knows the other's number. Both of the numbers are positive and consecutive. In the room with Alice and Bob, there is a clock that dings every minute. Someone can guess the other's number only at the ding of that clock, but they can also remain silent. If someone correctly guesses the other's number on the first try, both people $1 million.<br/><br/>There is a way to win without any form of communication between Alice and Bob, and, duh, without cheating. It's completely logical and can guarantee a win on the first try. How can they do it? Watch the video below to find out.<br/><br/>The Seemingly Impossible Guess The Number Puzzle<br/><br/>Share the knowledge!<br/><br/>Here's The Answer<br/><br/>Suppose Alice is told the number N. She hears the clock ding N-1 times, so she knows that Bob was told N+1. Therefore, on the next ding, she can correctly guess Bob's secret number. If we're dealing with small numbers, however, it can be played differently. If Alice was told 1, she knows Bob was told 2 because 0 is not a positive (or negative) number. Watch the video above for a more in depth explanation of this logic puzzle.

Spoileri hoiatus: See aju teaser on täiesti lahendatav. Kerige alla, et lugeda puzzle, ja saada vastus. Õnn kaasa!<br/><br/>Siin on puzzle<br/><br/>Alice ja Bob on mõlemad öelnud number, kuid kumbki ei tea teise number. Mõlemad numbrid on positiivsed ja järjestikused. Toas Alice ja Bob, seal on kell, mis dings iga minut. Keegi võib arvata teise numbri ainult selle kella dingil, kuid nad võivad ka vaikida. Kui keegi õigesti arvab teise numbri esimesel katsel, mõlemad inimesed $ 1 miljon.<br/><br/>Alice'i ja Bobi vahel on võimalus võita ilma igasuguse suhtluseta ja ilma petmata. See on täiesti loogiline ja võib tagada võidu esimesel katsel. Kuidas nad seda teevad? Vaadake allpool olevat videot, et teada saada.<br/><br/>Näiliselt võimatu arvab number puzzle<br/><br/>Jagage teadmisi!<br/><br/>Siin on vastus<br/><br/>Oletame, et Alice'ile öeldakse number N. Ta kuuleb kella tiksumist N-1 korda, nii et ta teab, et Bob'ile öeldi N+1. Seega saab ta järgmisel dingil õigesti ära arvata Bob'i salajase numbri. Kui tegemist on väikeste numbritega, saab seda siiski mängida erinevalt. Kui Alice' ile öeldi 1, teab ta, et Bob' ile öeldi 2, sest 0 ei ole positiivne (või negatiivne) arv. Vaata ülalolevat videot selle loogika mõistatuse põhjalikumaks selgitamiseks. Kas said sellest aru? |
| Web Services, Vendors And Cyber Laws!<br/><br/>Updated On:April 21, 2014Bilal Ahmad<br/><br/>Computerization of this world changed human performance scenario to a great extent and that too beyond measurement. For instance, Now you can send vital information all across the globe with a single mouse click, thanks to internet connectivity. Sadly, it is this wide connectivity and popularity among people, internet has also increased chances for computer crimes. Internet crimes or computer crimes are widely known as 'Cyber Crimes'.<br/><br/>'Cyber Laws' is something new in the judiciary system but has gained a lot of attention lately. The term cyber crime is something very synonymous with conventional crime, the only difference being medium of execution. There are majorly two types of cyber crimes, the first one is in which computers are the main targets and these include cases of data damage, malicious code and even criminal data access. The second one is in which computer is only a tool using which conventional crimes are committed for eg cyber terrorism, spamming, cyber stalking and many more.<br/><br/>This is where a website consultant or a vendor comes into scene. Although not aware of all the cyber laws present till date, a website vendor can advise you on some of the most vital cyber laws while creating your site.<br/><br/>This may include common knowledge of copy rights or even protecting the content of your own website. Explaining you all the rights you posses as a website owner is also one the tasks a website vendor may do while developing your website. A vendor can also assist you by offering you information on different cyber laws to protect data. Besides all of this, a vendor can also offer you information on any new cyber law that you may not be aware of till know. Cyber laws may vary from nation to nation, one recent example can be of the cookie law released in the United Kingdom, which prevents the website from saving any user browsing data. As per the Cookie Law, websites in the United Kingdom cannot save cookie files without informational consent from the surfer.<br/><br/>It is after the implementation of such law, websites now have a pop-up window, which seeks the consent of the visitor for saving cookies files. Such files are used by websites to analyze the browsing pattern of visitors based on which advertisements are then posted on a user window. With hacking not anymore a new thing for all of us, do you think such rules and regulations can prevent online forgery or cyber crime? Technology has developed at a rapid rate but still people do not prefer shopping online due to fear of personal or bank account details getting hacked. With the rise of cyber crime, need of stringent cyber laws have also increased to curb the same and to promote a risk free shopping experience.<br/><br/>Classes of Cyber Crimes<br/><br/>Over the years there have been three major classes of cyber crimes:<br/><br/>Unauthorized access of computer system cases, which involves hacking or stealing usernames and passwords to gain access over personal information of the respective user. These kind of backdoor access are organized with the help of Trojan Horse. Releasing malicious programs like Trojan House, worms or computer viruses etc. The last class includes cyber stalking a user or online harassment .<br/><br/>Direct implications of Cyber crimes<br/><br/>Decrease in sales<br/><br/>Decrease in staff output due to network delays<br/><br/>Loss of personalized information like research work<br/><br/>Disruption in communication process<br/><br/>Indirect implications of Cyber crimes<br/><br/>Credibility issue in our financial system<br/><br/>Brand image is tarnished in the market<br/><br/>Cyber crimes affect business to business relationship in the market<br/><br/>Sense of trust in state policies and government agencies is lost<br/><br/>Preventing Cyber Crime<br/><br/>As netizens there are certain precautions that we should consider for a safe and secure online experience. Here are some of them:<br/><br/>First thing to do will be to keep personal information to your self and avoid sharing the same online.<br/><br/>Avoid sharing any photographs with online chat friends or strangers.<br/><br/>Installing latest version of anti-virus on your system can offer you a good line of defense against internet threats like viruses and malware.<br/><br/>Keeping back up of your valuable data is a good option to avoid problems like virus contamination.<br/><br/>Avoid sending credit card information to sites that are unsecured and don't have any valid certificate.<br/><br/>Installing safety programme that offers you control over site cookies and saves you from being tracked by websites.<br/><br/>Putting host-based intrusions detection devices on servers will help you keep track of irregularities on your website traffic.<br/><br/>Use of firewall is advised.<br/><br/>Why Cyber attacks are so popular?<br/><br/>Cheaper than traditional cheating methods<br/><br/>Tracking cyber crimes are not easy<br/><br/>Exact locations cannot be tracked easily<br/><br/>Absence of physical barrier in the internet world<br/><br/>Cyber crimes affect large number of people<br/><br/>Conclusion<br/><br/>The fact that human mind has unfathomable power is undeniable, which is why internet crimes are increasing at a tremendous rate. Even history has witnessed some of the greatest internet security gone kaput by the hands of hackers, who have easily got away too. The only way to curb such crime is to remain aware of the cyber laws that we have today, that can either be through internet or through website/IT vendors. Information Technology Act has to be balanced in such a way that it proves too stringent for people who are involved in cyber crimes and at the same time it should never hamper the growth of Internet industry.<br/><br/>Author Bio:– Maneet Puri at present is heading a quality web design firm located at New Delhi, India.

Näiteks, Nüüd saate tänu internetiühendusele saata olulist teavet kogu maailmas ühe hiireklõpsuga. Kahjuks on see lai ühenduvus ja populaarsus inimeste seas, Internet on ka suurenenud võimalused arvuti kuritegusid. Internet kuritegusid või arvuti kuritegusid on laialdaselt tuntud kui "küberkuriteod".<br/><br/>"Küberseadused" on midagi uut kohtusüsteemi, kuid on pälvinud palju tähelepanu viimasel ajal. Termin küberkuritegevus on midagi väga sünonüümiks tavapärase kuritegevuse, ainus erinevus on keskmise täitmise. On peamiselt kahte tüüpi küberkuritegusid, millest esimene on see, et arvutid on peamised sihtmärgid ja nende hulka kuuluvad andmete kahjustamise juhtumid, pahatahtlik kood ja isegi kriminaalne juurdepääs andmetele. Teine on see, et arvuti on ainult vahend, mille abil pannakse toime tavapäraseid kuritegusid nt küberterrorismi, rämpsposti, küberkiusamise ja palju muud.<br/><br/>See on koht, kus veebisaidi konsultant või müüja siseneb stseeni. Kuigi te ei ole teadlik kõigist küberseadustest, mis on seni olemas, võib veebisaidi müüja teile oma saidi loomisel nõu anda mõnede kõige olulisemate küberseaduste kohta.<br/><br/>See võib hõlmata üldteadmisi kopeerimisõigustest või isegi oma veebisaidi sisu kaitsmisest. Kõigi õiguste selgitamine, mis teil veebisaidi omanikuna on, on ka üks ülesandeid, mida veebisaidi müüja võib oma veebisaidi arendamisel teha. Müüja saab teid aidata, pakkudes teile teavet erinevate küberseaduste kohta, et kaitsta andmeid. Lisaks sellele võib müüja pakkuda teile ka teavet uute küberseaduste kohta, millest te ei pruugi olla teadlik. Küberseadused võivad riigiti erineda, üks hiljutine näide võib olla Ühendkuningriigis välja antud küpsiste seadus, mis takistab veebisaidil kasutaja sirvimisandmete salvestamist. Vastavalt küpsiseseadusele ei saa Ühendkuningriigi veebisaidid salvestada küpsisefaile ilma veebilehitseja informatiivse nõusolekuta.<br/><br/>Pärast sellise seaduse rakendamist on veebisaitidel nüüd hüpikaken, mis otsib külastaja nõusolekut küpsiste salvestamiseks. Selliseid faile kasutavad veebisaidid, et analüüsida külastajate sirvimismustrit, mille põhjal reklaamid seejärel kasutaja aknasse postitatakse. Mis häkkimine ei ole enam uus asi meile kõigile, kas te arvate, et sellised eeskirjad ja määrused võivad takistada online võltsimine või küberkuritegevus? Tehnoloogia on arenenud kiires tempos, kuid siiski inimesed ei eelista osta online tõttu hirm isikliku või pangakonto andmed häkkimine. Küberkuritegevuse tõusuga on kasvanud ka vajadus rangete küberseaduste järele, et seda piirata ja edendada riskivaba ostukogemust.<br/><br/>Küberkuritegude klassid<br/><br/>Aastate jooksul on olnud kolm peamist küberkuritegude kategooriat:<br/><br/>Lubamatu juurdepääs arvutisüsteemi juhtumitele, mis hõlmab kasutajanimede ja paroolide häkkimist või varastamist, et saada juurdepääs vastava kasutaja isikuandmetele. Sellised tagauksejuurdepääsud on korraldatud Trooja hobuse abiga. Vabastades pahatahtlikke programme nagu Trooja maja, ussid või arvutiviirused jne Viimane klass hõlmab küberkiusamist kasutaja või online ahistamine .<br/><br/>Küberkuritegevuse otsesed tagajärjed<br/><br/>Müügi vähenemine<br/><br/>Töötajate arvu vähenemine võrguga seotud viivituste tõttu<br/><br/>Isikupärastatud teabe kaotus, näiteks teadustöö<br/><br/>Häire kommunikatsiooniprotsessis<br/><br/>Küberkuritegevuse kaudsed tagajärjed<br/><br/>Usaldusväärsuse probleem meie finantssüsteemis<br/><br/>Brändi maine on turul tuhmunud<br/><br/>Küberkuriteod mõjutavad ärisuhteid turul<br/><br/>Usaldus riigi poliitika ja valitsusasutuste vastu on kadunud<br/><br/>Küberkuritegevuse ennetamine<br/><br/>Netizens on teatud ettevaatusabinõud, mida me peaksime kaaluma ohutu ja turvaline online kogemus. Siin on mõned neist:<br/><br/>Esimene asi, mida peate tegema, on hoida isiklikku teavet enda jaoks ja vältida samade andmete jagamist võrgus.<br/><br/>Vältige fotode jagamist veebivestluste sõprade või võõrastega.<br/><br/>Viirusetõrje uusima versiooni installimine teie süsteemi võib pakkuda teile head kaitset Interneti-ohtude, näiteks viiruste ja pahavara vastu.<br/><br/>Oma väärtuslike andmete varundamine on hea võimalus selliste probleemide vältimiseks nagu viiruse saastumine.<br/><br/>Vältige krediitkaarditeabe saatmist veebisaitidele, mis on tagatiseta ja millel ei ole kehtivat sertifikaati.<br/><br/>Paigaldatakse turvaprogramm, mis võimaldab teil kontrollida saidi küpsiseid ja päästa teid veebisaitide jälgimisest.<br/><br/>Hostipõhise sissetungi tuvastamise seadmete paigutamine serveritesse aitab teil jälgida oma veebisaidi liikluses esinevaid eeskirjade eiramisi.<br/><br/>Soovitatav on kasutada tulemüüri.<br/><br/>Miks on küberrünnakud nii populaarsed?<br/><br/>Odavam kui traditsioonilised petmise meetodid<br/><br/>Küberkuritegevuse jälitamine ei ole lihtne<br/><br/>Täpseid asukohti ei ole lihtne jälgida<br/><br/>Füüsilise barjääri puudumine internetis<br/><br/>Küberkuriteod mõjutavad suurt hulka inimesi<br/><br/>Järeldus<br/><br/>Asjaolu, et inimmõistusel on mõõtmatu jõud, on vaieldamatu, mistõttu Interneti-kuriteod kasvavad tohutu kiirusega. Isegi ajalugu on näinud mõningaid suurimaid Interneti-turvalisust, mis on häkkerite kätte sattunud, kes on ka kergesti pääsenud. Ainus viis sellise kuritegevuse piiramiseks on olla teadlik küberseadustest, mis meil täna on, mis võivad olla kas Interneti kaudu või veebisaidi / IT-tarnijate kaudu. Infotehnoloogia seadus peab olema tasakaalustatud nii, et see osutub küberkuritegudega seotud inimeste jaoks liiga rangeks ja samal ajal ei tohiks see kunagi takistada Interneti-tööstuse kasvu.<br/><br/>Autor Bio:- Maneet Puri juhib praegu kvaliteetset veebidisaini ettevõtet, mis asub Indias New Delhis.
