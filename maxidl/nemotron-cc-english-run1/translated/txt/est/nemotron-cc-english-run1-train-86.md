| Leclaire<br/><br/>The historic Leclaire neighborhood, once referred to as Edwardsville's "suburb to the south," was founded as a cooperative community in 1890 and remained a separate village until annexed to the city of Edwardsville in 1934. Newspapers and magazines throughout the United States and Europe reported on the Leclaire experiment, particularly during the first 20 years of its existence. In 1979, due to its unique history, the former village was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.<br/><br/>Leclaire was founded by Nelson Oliver Nelson, a St. Louis plumbing manufacturer who, for many years, sought to advance the plight of the working class. Nelson wanted to improve working conditions for his employees and provide housing near the factories so workers and their families could easily participate in recreational and educational programs offered free of charge by the company. Prior to 1890, while still in St. Louis, the N. O. Nelson Company's manufacturing and distribution businesses began providing profit sharing along with educational and recreational opportunities. The Leclaire cooperative experiment would bring additional benefits.<br/><br/>When Nelson employees indicated they wanted to relocate to a rural location, company representatives approached leaders of small towns in several Missouri and Illinois communities near their St. Louis headquarters. They were looking for a suitable property to build new factories and a model village. South of Edwardsville they found a 125-acre tract of land with access to water, coal, and transportation. Local businessmen acted quickly to offer a financial incentive. In less than three weeks, the community raised a fund of $20,000 from individual contributions of between $1 and $1,000 to entice Nelson to choose Edwardsville for his enterprise.<br/><br/>City leaders had hoped to locate property inside the city limits of Edwardsville, but when no suitable site could be found, they were confident that the Nelson investment south of town would soon become a part of Edwardsville. Although Nelson fulfilled all the contingencies for construction and job creation in his contract, it would be 44 years before annexation to Edwardsville. Leclaire, bounded by Madison/Brown Avenues to the east, the railroad tracks to the west, Hadley/McKinley Avenues on the south and Wolf Street to the north, remained an independent village from 1890 to 1934. During that time it earned a reputation for innovations in business, education and residential planning.<br/><br/>The village of Leclaire on a 1931 map of Edwardsville<br/>Courtesy of Paul Jenkins<br/><br/>Nelson's decision to build a village was not made on a whim. By the late 1880s he was an international leader in the fields of cooperation and profit-sharing, exchanging social theories with others around the world while expanding his St. Louis business. He named his experimental village after the Parisian profit-sharer, Edme Jean Leclaire, but he visited many other social visionaries who provided information and inspiration. Compiling the best ideas from these examples, Nelson founded Leclaire to, in his words, "give work, promote intelligence, provide recreation, foster beauty, and make homes." These were all factors he determined necessary for men to lead fulfilling lives. Later writers used these words to formulate Leclaire's founding principles: Work, Homes, Education, Recreation, and Beauty, but with the additional important principle of Freedom.<br/><br/>Work<br/><br/>Work could be considered the most important of these factors since without the factory jobs in Leclaire, there would be no village. The brick factory buildings were designed by architect E. A. Cameron to provide natural light, ventilation in the summer, and heated floors in the winter. There was a fire suppression system and, although industrial accidents were not eliminated, every effort was made to guarantee the safety of the workers. The ivy-covered brick buildings were surrounded by well-manicured lawns and flower gardens giving the complex a campus-like appearance. In 1894, New York World reporter Nellie Bly called the buildings "the ideal perfection of buildings for man to labor in".<br/><br/>The manufacturing complex of the N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company in Leclaire<br/>From Friends of Leclaire<br/><br/>Nelson company policies were designed to protect the financial stability of employees. Workers could earn a share of the profits and have a voice in the company if they chose that option. The profit-sharing plan gave Nelson employees a pride of ownership that resulted in a supportive workforce. There were a few short-lived labor strikes over the years, but for the most part, labor problems were rare. Workers also had reasonable hours and competitive wages. There was a provident fund that provided for pensions and sick leave, as well as widow pensions if a worker died, whether or not the death was related to his employment.<br/><br/>Company headquarters for the N. O. Nelson Company (NONCO) remained in St. Louis, but all of the N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company was moved to Leclaire. The manufacturing company was divided into shops that made a variety of products. In 1900, the shops became independent companies for tax purposes, but all were still owned by the N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company. The shops included the Cabinet Mill where wood products from cabinetry to millwork were produced. The skilled craftsmen that worked here also fulfilled special contracts, including teller cages for a local bank and an altar still in use at St. Andrew's Episcopal Church in Edwardsville. The Marble Shop specialized in architectural marble that was cut and installed by Nelson crews in homes, businesses, and even state capitols throughout the Midwest. The Machine Shop, which became Bignall and Keeler, made pipe fitting machines, pumps, gauges, and various mechanical tools expected in the plumbing trade. They also branched out to manufacture specialty items like the Leclaire Bicycle in the mid-1890s. The Brass Shop included a foundry where various plumbing pipes and tools were manufactured. These examples represent just some of the work done in the Leclaire factories. The company's logo was a stylized "NONCO" that can still be seen on plumbing fixtures and some fire hydrants in Edwardsville today.<br/><br/>Homes<br/><br/>Before homes could be built, housing was needed for workers who were completing the factory buildings as well as building homes. To meet those needs, the company built the "Club House," a large building that served many purposes. In addition to lodging, it was the community's first educational building, and it contained a well-stocked library.<br/><br/>Construction of the residential portion of Leclaire began immediately after the village was founded in June of 1890. Julius Pitzman, the innovative landscape architect who laid out the first lots in Leclaire, set them up with a number of protective covenants. The covenants provided for wide, curvilinear streets, large lots, and a deed restriction that limited the properties to residential or educational purposes only. The company paved the streets, provided electric street lights, installed sidewalks, and planted hundreds of trees along the streets of Leclaire. Later sections of Leclaire were laid out with a conventional grid design and smaller lots, but still included the deed restrictions.<br/><br/>A Leclaire Victorian cottage in 1907<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Initially the homes were built by the company and then sold at near cost to Nelson employees to encourage home ownership. If a worker became ill and could not make his mortgage, payments were suspended until after he returned to work. The homes were offered in a variety of house designs and the company advertised that no two dwellings were alike. The earliest homes were primarily Victorian cottages that came with electricity and running water. These were followed by bungalows, foursquares, and even some kit homes. Residents could purchase a company-built home or buy an empty lot and build a house themselves, provided the architectural design met company standards.<br/><br/>In later years, lots were sold to investors, usually Edwardsville residents, and many homes in the 1920s were built by local contractors who then sold them to area residents.<br/><br/>Education<br/><br/>Nelson believed in education for everyone, including the working class. Educational programming began with a kindergarten at the Club House in 1892 and continued in the new educational building at 722 Holyoake Road. Commonly called the "School House," this building provided a large hall for meetings and programs, but had moveable partitions to divide it into classroom space during the day. In the evenings, there were dances, meetings, or programs of the Leclaire Self-Culture Club which featured weekly lectures by Washington University professors or nationally known speakers who, like N. O. Nelson, were part of the social betterment movement at the turn of the century. These included Jane Addams, Edward Everett Hale, Samuel "Golden Rule" Jones, and author Charlotte Perkins Gilman, among others.<br/><br/>Children enrolled in the Leclaire kindergarten in 1913<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>In the ten years following the 1895 construction of the education building, there were a series of educational experiments including an industrial school, college, night school, and an academy. The earliest and longest-lived endeavor was the morning kindergarten, founded in 1892, that used the Fröbel Model. This two-year program was free to everyone, including Edwardsville children, until 1931 when for financial reasons the company began charging tuition to students who were not the children of employees. Nelson Manufacturing operated a kindergarten until 1934 when the building was turned over to the Edwardsville School District for a nominal fee.<br/><br/>Recreation<br/><br/>Boaters on Leclaire Lake in 1915<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Recreation was an important feature of Leclaire. The company provided sports facilities for baseball, tennis, and later, football. A bowling and billiard hall was constructed and there was a lake for boating, swimming, fishing, or ice skating in winter. Leclaire Park was furnished with boathouses, male & female bath houses, and a large pavilion. Residents organized dances, hayrides, spelling bees, and other activities, and the company sponsored a band that played regularly at entertainments in the village or in Edwardsville. Like the educational functions at the Club House and School House, the recreational facilities at Leclaire were open to all and were often a destination for Edwardsville and even St. Louis visitors.<br/><br/>Beauty<br/><br/>Early photograph of Leclaire Lake<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>The last of the factors Nelson deemed important for a satisfying life concerned the environment. Nelson knew about the importance of healthy living. He valued the beauty and cleanliness that could be found in the country, and encouraged all in Leclaire to beautify their property by planting gardens and orchards. Nelson himself led by example, so a company greenhouse provided free flowers and competitions were held for the most beautiful yards. Leclaire was laid out so that the entire village had a park-like setting still evident today.<br/><br/>Freedom<br/><br/>The Leclaire Cooperative store<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Nelson listed five founding principles for Leclaire, but modern writers add a sixth: Freedom. All of the programs offered by the company were available to employees as well as local residents, but none were mandatory. The freedom to choose whether or not to participate in company programs was entirely up to the individual. Residents of Leclaire could work for Nelson Manufacturing or elsewhere, and workers were under no obligation to live in Leclaire. Participation in recreational and educational programs was also optional. There was also a company store where employees could shop, but unlike other company towns, no one was in debt to the company store. The Leclaire Store was a cooperative where members were charged fair market prices, but were then paid quarterly dividends.<br/><br/>A Different Company Town<br/><br/>All of these benefits made Leclaire unique from other company towns. But there were also individual instances where the company showed compassion and care for the employees. The company closed the factories and hired excursion trains to take workers and their families to St. Louis for a day at the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair. When money was tight, Nelson would occasionally place extra cash in each pay envelope to make life easier for workers, and if he instituted a program the men did not agree with, they talked it out and, as often as not, Nelson would reverse himself.<br/><br/>Born in Lillesand, Norway, in 1841, N. O. Nelson was a complicated man. He was a capitalist who believed in free enterprise, but also a socialist, a follower of the "Golden Rule", and a patriot who served for the Union in the Civil War. By 1900, he was a multimillionaire, but by the time of his death in 1922, he had given it all away for the betterment of the working class.<br/><br/>Although Leclaire was not Nelson's only social experiment, it is considered his most successful endeavor. Other major efforts for social betterment included a chain of co-operative grocery stores in New Orleans, a kindergarten for the children of black employees in his Bessemer, Alabama, factories, and a home for consumptives in Indio, California.<br/><br/>Nelson's Village of Leclaire was renowned internationally as a noteworthy and successful experiment. It was described in the New York World on numerous occasions but in particular by reporter Nellie Bly in 1894 who wrote at length about the model town where "The labor question is solved and everybody happy in a little village near St. Louis." The Los Angeles Times also regularly reported on N. O. Nelson, as did the Chicago Daily Tribune and numerous other publications.<br/><br/>In a speech at Leclaire's 15th anniversary celebration in 1915, Nelson said, "Leclaire extends to you a wide open hospitality, and bids you enjoy today the ease and comfort and beauty and inspiration which we enjoy every day." More than a century has passed since that day, but the invitation still stands. Residents and researchers are invited to learn about Leclaire's history and consider the lessons that might be learned for the betterment of future generations.<br/><br/>One of the former buildings of the manufacturing complex in 2019, which now serves as the N. O. Nelson Campus of Lewis and Clark Community College<br/>Photo by Ben Ostermeier<br/><br/>Friends of Leclaire, organized in 1990 following Leclaire's Centennial celebration, promotes the history of Leclaire through a website (historic-leclaire.org), publications, and a festival, Leclaire Parkfest, held annually on the third Sunday in October | Leclaire<br/><br/>Ajalooline Leclaire'i naabruskond, mida kunagi nimetati Edwardsville'i lõunapoolseks äärelinnaks, asutati ühistu kogukonnana 1890. aastal ja jäi eraldi külaks kuni Edwardsville'i linna annekteerimiseni 1934. aastal. Ajalehed ja ajakirjad kogu Ameerika Ühendriikides ja Euroopas teatasid Leclaire'i eksperimendist, eriti selle esimese 20 aasta jooksul. Aastal 1979, tänu oma unikaalsele ajaloole, oli endine küla kantud ajalooliste paikade riiklikusse registrisse.<br/><br/>Leclaire'i asutas Nelson Oliver Nelson, St. Louisi torustiku tootja, kes püüdis aastaid töölisklassi olukorda edendada. Nelson soovis parandada oma töötajate töötingimusi ja pakkuda tehaste läheduses eluasemeid, et töötajad ja nende pered saaksid hõlpsasti osaleda ettevõtte poolt tasuta pakutavates puhke- ja haridusprogrammides. Enne 1890. aastat, olles veel St. Louisis, hakkasid N. O. Nelson Company tootmis- ja turustusettevõtted pakkuma kasumi jagamist koos haridus- ja puhkevõimalustega. Leclaire'i koostööeksperiment tooks lisakasu.<br/><br/>Kui Nelsoni töötajad teatasid, et nad soovivad maapiirkonda ümber asuda, pöördusid ettevõtte esindajad mitme Missouri ja Illinoisi kogukonna väikelinnade juhtidega nende St. Louisi peakorteri lähedal. Nad otsisid sobivat kinnisvara uute tehaste ja mudeli küla ehitamiseks. Edwardsville'ist lõuna pool leidsid nad 125-aakri maa-ala, millel oli juurdepääs veele, söele ja transpordile. Kohalikud ärimehed tegutsesid kiiresti, et pakkuda rahalist stiimulit. Vähem kui kolme nädala jooksul kogus kogukond $ 20 000 fondi individuaalsetest annetustest vahemikus $ 1 kuni $ 1000, et meelitada Nelsonit oma ettevõtte jaoks Edwardsville'i valima.<br/><br/>Linnajuhid olid lootnud leida kinnisvara Edwardsville'i linnapiirides, kuid kui sobivat kohta ei leitud, olid nad kindlad, et Nelsoni investeering linna lõunaosas muutub varsti Edwardsville'i osaks. Kuigi Nelson täitis oma lepingus kõik ehituse ja töökohtade loomise tingimused, oleks see 44 aastat enne Edwardsville'i annekteerimist. Leclaire, mida piirasid Madison / Brown Avenues idas, raudteed läänes, Hadley / McKinley Avenues lõunas ja Wolf Street põhjas, jäi iseseisvaks külaks 1890. aastast kuni 1934. aastani. Selle aja jooksul teenis ta maine uuenduste eest ettevõtluses, hariduses ja eluaseme planeerimises.<br/><br/>Leclaire'i küla 1931. aasta Edwardsville'i kaardil<br/>Märksõnad:paul jenkins<br/><br/>1880. aastate lõpul oli ta rahvusvaheline liider koostöö ja kasumi jagamise valdkonnas, vahetades sotsiaalseid teooriaid teistega üle maailma, laiendades samal ajal oma St. Louisi äri. Ta nimetas oma eksperimentaalse küla Pariisi kasumijagaja Edme Jean Leclaire'i järgi, kuid külastas paljusid teisi sotsiaalseid visionääre, kes andsid teavet ja inspiratsiooni. Koostades parimad ideed nendest näidetest, asutas Nelson Leclaire'i, et oma sõnadega "anna tööd, edendada intelligentsust, pakkuda vaba aega, edendada ilu ja teha kodusid". Need olid kõik tegurid, mida ta otsustas, et mehed peavad elama rahuldust pakkuvat elu. Hiljem kasutasid kirjanikud neid sõnu Leclaire'i aluspõhimõtete sõnastamiseks: töö, kodud, haridus, vaba aeg ja ilu, kuid täiendava olulise vabaduse põhimõttega.<br/><br/>Tööd<br/><br/>Töö võib pidada kõige olulisem neist teguritest, sest ilma tehase töökohti Leclaire, ei oleks küla. Telliskivitehase hooned kujundas arhitekt E. A. Cameron, et pakkuda loomulikku valgust, ventilatsiooni suvel ja soojendusega põrandaid talvel. Seal oli tuletõrjesüsteem ja kuigi tööstusõnnetusi ei kõrvaldatud, tehti kõik jõupingutused töötajate ohutuse tagamiseks. Ivy kaetud tellistest hooned olid ümbritsetud hästi maniküüritud muru ja lilleaiad, mis annavad kompleksile ülikoolilinnaku välimuse. 1894. aastal nimetas New York Worldi reporter Nellie Bly hooneid "ideaalseks hoonete täiuslikkuseks, kus inimene töötab".<br/><br/>N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company tootmiskompleks Leclaire'is<br/>Leclaire'i sõpradelt<br/><br/>Nelsoni ettevõtte poliitika eesmärk oli kaitsta töötajate finantsstabiilsust. Töötajad võiksid teenida osa kasumist ja omada ettevõttes häält, kui nad seda võimalust valisid. Kasumi jagamise kava andis Nelsoni töötajatele omandiõiguse uhkuse, mille tulemuseks oli toetav tööjõud. Aastate jooksul oli paar lühiajalist tööjõu streiki, kuid enamasti olid tööjõuprobleemid haruldased. Töötajatel oli ka mõistlikud tunnid ja konkurentsivõimeline palk. Oli ettenägelik fond, mis nägi ette pensionid ja haiguspuhkuse, samuti lesepensionid, kui töötaja suri, olenemata sellest, kas surm oli seotud tema tööga või mitte.<br/><br/>N. O. Nelson Company (NONCO) peakorter jäi St. Louis'i, kuid kogu N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company kolis Leclaire'i. Tootmisettevõte jagati kauplustesse, mis tegid erinevaid tooteid. 1900. aastal muutusid kauplused maksustamise mõttes iseseisvateks ettevõteteks, kuid kõik olid endiselt N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company omanduses. Kaupluste hulka kuulus Cabinet Mill, kus toodeti puittooteid alates kapist kuni veskitöödeni. Siin töötanud oskuslikud käsitöölised täitisid ka erilepinguid, sealhulgas kohaliku panga panga puurid ja Edwardsville'is St Andrew'i piiskopi kirikus veel kasutusel olev altar. Marmoripood on spetsialiseerunud arhitektuurilisele marmorile, mida Nelsoni meeskonnad lõigasid ja paigaldasid kodudesse, ettevõtetesse ja isegi riigi pealinnadesse kogu Midwestis. Masinapood, millest sai Bignall ja Keeler, tegi torude paigaldamise masinad, pumbad, mõõturid ja mitmesugused mehaanilised tööriistad, mida oodatakse torustiku kaubanduses. Nad hargnesid ka selleks, et toota selliseid eritooteid nagu Leclaire Bicycle 1890. aastate keskel. Brass Shop sisaldas valukoda, kus valmistati erinevaid torustikke ja tööriistu. Need näited on vaid osa Leclaire'i tehastes tehtud tööst. Ettevõtte logo oli stiliseeritud "NONCO", mis on endiselt näha torustikul ja mõnedel tuletõrjehüdrantidel Edwardsville'is täna.<br/><br/>Kodud<br/><br/>Enne kodude ehitamist oli vaja nii tehasehoonete valmimist kui ka kodude ehitamist. Nende vajaduste rahuldamiseks ehitas ettevõte "Club House", suure hoone, mis teenis paljusid eesmärke. Lisaks majutusele oli see kogukonna esimene haridushoone ja see sisaldas hästi varustatud raamatukogu.<br/><br/>Leclaire'i elamuosa ehitamine algas kohe pärast küla asutamist 1890. aasta juunis. Innovatiivne maastikuarhitekt Julius Pitzman, kes pani esimesed partiid Leclaire'is, pani need üles mitmete kaitselepingutega. Lepingud nägid ette laiad, kurvilised tänavad, suured krundid ja teo piirangu, mis piiras kinnisvara ainult elu- või hariduslikel eesmärkidel. Ettevõte sillutas tänavaid, varustas elektrilisi tänavavalgustusi, paigaldas kõnniteed ja istutas sadu puid Leclaire'i tänavatele. Leclaire'i hilisemad lõigud olid tavapärase ruudustiku kujundusega ja väiksemate partiidega, kuid sisaldasid siiski teo piiranguid.<br/><br/>Leclaire'i viktoriaanlikus suvilas 1907. aastal<br/>Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Esialgu ehitati kodud ettevõtte poolt ja seejärel müüdi Nelsoni töötajatele kodu omandiõiguse soodustamiseks. Kui töötaja haigestus ja ei suutnud oma hüpoteeki teha, peatati maksed enne, kui ta tööle naasis. Maju pakuti erinevates majakujundustes ja ettevõte reklaamis, et kaks eluruumi ei olnud sarnased. Varaseimad kodud olid peamiselt viktoriaanlikud majad, mis tulid elektri ja jooksva veega. Neile järgnesid bangalod, nelinurksed ja isegi mõned komplektide kodud. Elanikud võisid osta ettevõtte ehitatud kodu või osta tühja krundi ja ehitada maja ise, tingimusel, et arhitektuur vastab ettevõtte standarditele.<br/><br/>Hilisematel aastatel müüdi palju investoreid, tavaliselt Edwardsville'i elanikke, ja 1920. aastatel ehitasid paljud kodud kohalikud töövõtjad, kes seejärel müüsid need piirkonna elanikele.<br/><br/>Õppetöö<br/><br/>Nelson uskus haridust kõigile, sealhulgas töölisklassile. Haridusprogrammeerimine algas 1892. aastal Club House'i lasteaiaga ja jätkus uues haridushoones 722 Holyoake Road'il. Tavaliselt nimetatakse seda "koolimajaks", see hoone pakkus koosolekute ja programmide jaoks suurt saali, kuid sellel oli liikuvad vaheseinad, et jagada see päeva jooksul klassiruumiks. Õhtuti toimusid Leclaire Self-Culture Clubi tantsud, kohtumised või programmid, mis sisaldasid Washingtoni ülikooli professorite või riiklikult tuntud kõnelejate iganädalasi loenguid, kes, nagu N. O. Nelson, olid sajandivahetuse sotsiaalse paranemise liikumise osa. Nende hulka kuulusid muu hulgas Jane Addams, Edward Everett Hale, Samuel "Golden Rule" Jones ja autor Charlotte Perkins Gilman.<br/><br/>1913. aastal Leclaire'i lasteaeda õppinud lapsed<br/>Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Kümme aastat pärast 1895. aasta haridushoone ehitamist toimusid mitmed hariduslikud eksperimendid, sealhulgas tööstuskool, kolledž, öökool ja akadeemia. Kõige varasem ja pikaealisem ettevõtmine oli 1892. aastal asutatud hommikune lasteaed, mis kasutas Fröbeli mudelit. See kaheaastane programm oli tasuta kõigile, sealhulgas Edwardsville'i lastele, kuni 1931. aastani, mil ettevõte hakkas rahalistel põhjustel õppemaksu võtma üliõpilastele, kes ei olnud töötajate lapsed. Nelson Manufacturing haldas lasteaeda kuni 1934. aastani, mil hoone anti Edwardsville'i kooliringkonnale nominaaltasu eest.<br/><br/>Puhkus<br/><br/>Boaters Leclaire'i järvel 1915. aastal<br/>Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Puhkus oli Leclaire'i oluline omadus. Ettevõte pakkus spordivõimalusi pesapalli, tennise ja hiljem jalgpalli jaoks. Ehitati bowling ja piljardisaal ning talvel oli paadisõit, ujumine, kalapüük või uisutamine. Leclaire Park oli sisustatud paadimajade, meeste ja naiste vannitubadega ning suure paviljoniga. Elanikud korraldasid tantse, heina, õigekirja mesilasi ja muid tegevusi ning ettevõte sponsoreeris ansamblit, kes mängis regulaarselt külas või Edwardsville'is. Nagu Club House'i ja koolimaja haridusfunktsioonid, olid Leclaire'i puhkevõimalused kõigile avatud ja olid sageli Edwardsville'i ja isegi St. Louisi külastajate sihtkohaks.<br/><br/>Ilu<br/><br/>Varajane foto Leclaire'i järvest<br/>Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Viimane tegur, mida Nelson pidas rahuldava elu jaoks oluliseks, oli seotud keskkonnaga. Ta hindas ilu ja puhtust, mis võib leida riigis, ja julgustas kõiki Leclaire kaunistada oma vara istutades aiad ja viljapuuaiad. Nelson ise juhtis eeskuju, nii et ettevõtte kasvuhoone andis tasuta lilli ja võistlusi peeti kõige ilusamates õuedes. Leclaire oli paigutatud nii, et kogu külas oli pargilaadne seade veel tänapäevalgi ilmne.<br/><br/>Vabadus<br/><br/>Leclaire'i ühistu pood<br/>Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Nelson loetles Leclaire'i viis aluspõhimõtet, kuid kaasaegsed kirjanikud lisavad kuuenda: vabadus. Kõik ettevõtte pakutavad programmid olid kättesaadavad nii töötajatele kui ka kohalikele elanikele, kuid ükski neist ei olnud kohustuslik. Vabadus valida, kas osaleda ettevõtte programmides või mitte, sõltus täielikult üksikisikust. Leclaire'i elanikud võisid töötada Nelson Manufacturing'is või mujal ning töötajad ei olnud kohustatud elama Leclaire'is. Vabatahtlik oli ka osalemine vabaaja- ja haridusprogrammides. Seal oli ka ettevõtte kauplus, kus töötajad said osta, kuid erinevalt teistest ettevõtte linnadest ei olnud keegi ettevõtte kauplusele võlgu. Leclaire'i pood oli ühistu, kus liikmetelt küsiti õiglast turuhinda, kuid seejärel maksti neile kvartaalseid dividende.<br/><br/>Erineva ettevõtte linn<br/><br/>Kõik need eelised tegid Leclaire'i ainulaadseks teistest ettevõtte linnadest. Kuid oli ka üksikuid juhtumeid, kus ettevõte näitas üles kaastunnet ja hoolitsust töötajate eest. Ettevõte sulges tehased ja palkas ekskursioonirongid, et viia töötajad ja nende pered St. Louisi 1904. aasta St. Louisi maailmamessil. Kui raha oli kitsas, pani Nelson aeg-ajalt igasse palgaümbrikusse lisaraha, et töötajate elu lihtsamaks muuta, ja kui ta algatas programmi, millega mehed ei nõustunud, rääkisid nad selle välja ja nii tihti kui mitte, Nelson pööras ennast tagasi.<br/><br/>N. O. Nelson sündis 1841. aastal Norras Lillesandis. Ta oli keeruline mees. Ta oli kapitalist, kes uskus vabasse ettevõtlusse, kuid ka sotsialist, "kuldse reegli" järgija ja patrioot, kes teenis liidus kodusõjas. 1900. aastaks oli ta multimiljonär, kuid oma surma ajaks 1922. aastal oli ta andnud kõik töölisklassi parandamiseks.<br/><br/>Kuigi Leclaire ei olnud Nelsoni ainus sotsiaalne eksperiment, peetakse seda tema kõige edukamaks püüdluseks. Teised suuremad jõupingutused sotsiaalseks parandamiseks hõlmasid New Orleansi ühistute toidupoed, lasteaed mustanahaliste töötajate lastele tema Bessemeris, Alabamas, tehastes ja kodu tarbijatele Indios, Californias.<br/><br/>Nelsoni Leclaire'i küla oli rahvusvaheliselt tuntud kui märkimisväärne ja edukas eksperiment. Seda kirjeldati New Yorgi maailmas mitmel korral, kuid eriti reporter Nellie Bly 1894. aastal, kes kirjutas pikalt mudelilinnast, kus "tööjõu küsimus on lahendatud ja kõik on õnnelikud väikeses külas St. Louisi lähedal." Los Angeles Times kirjutas regulaarselt ka N. O. Nelsonist, samuti Chicago Daily Tribune’ist ja paljudest teistest väljaannetest.<br/><br/>Oma kõnes Leclaire'i 15. aastapäeva tähistamisel 1915. aastal ütles Nelson: "Leclaire laiendab teile laialdast avatud külalislahkust ja pakub teile täna naudingut ja mugavust ning ilu ja inspiratsiooni, mida me iga päev naudime." Sellest päevast on möödunud rohkem kui sajand, kuid kutse on endiselt olemas. Elanikke ja teadlasi kutsutakse tutvuma Leclaire'i ajalooga ja kaaluma õppetunde, mida võiks õppida tulevaste põlvkondade parandamiseks.<br/><br/>Üks tootmiskompleksi endistest hoonetest 2019. aastal, mis on nüüd Lewise ja Clarki kogukonna kolledži N. O.

Skype is a great option for schools/classes who aren't bringing in in-person authors, but who want to explore books and poetry, connect with an author, and ask one-on-one questions.<br/><br/>Cost<br/><br/>I offer 30-45-minute Zoom or Skype visits with schools for $125 per session (or $200 for two sessions happening within three hours in the morning or the afternoon; $325 for three sessions in one day; $425 for four sessions in one day). In each session, I try to get kids as actively involved as possible. No, it's not the same kind of connection as an in-person visit offers, but it can still be inspiring and motivating for kids!<br/><br/>What I Do<br/><br/>Each session for up to 50 students includes:<br/><br/>5 minutes of tech set-up<br/><br/>3 segments of 10ish-minutes each — You choose from:<br/><br/>How I became a writer<br/><br/>Writing this particular book (you choose which book I focus on)<br/><br/>Reading (I read some poems and kids help me read others)<br/><br/>Classroom presentation (your students put on a reading or performance for me—a very appreciative audience!)<br/><br/>Writing a poem together<br/><br/>Question and answer session<br/><br/>5 minutes of wrap-ups/goodbyes<br/><br/>I also chat with classes of pre-service teachers or groups of in-service teachers about poetry and writing.<br/><br/>Tips for a Great Virtual Visit<br/><br/>Tips for a Successful Virtual Visit<br/><br/>One of my goals for virtual school visits is to capture the interactivity that makes in-person visits successful and fun. But the truth is that sometimes it's tough to be virtually interactive! The timing might not sync up correctly, which makes reading together a challenge, and it's really hard for me to hear individual students unless they come up and speak directly into the microphone/computer. But after some trial and error, I've discovered some ways to have the best virtual visits possible. Here they are: 10 ways to make my visit with your students a great experience!<br/><br/>Before the Visit<br/><br/>Get kids as excited as possible about the visit. Visit my website with them. Read some of my books with them. Gather some questions students have for me. Anything you do ahead of time to make it feel like a BIG DEAL will go a long way toward student engagement.<br/><br/>Position the video camera or laptop with webcam so that I can see as much of the audience as possible. It's hard to assess student engagement when I can only see a couple of students.<br/><br/>Limit each group to 50 students. It's incredibly hard to engage large groups via video.<br/><br/>I'll move quickly from topic to topic or poem to poem. Please remind students that they'll need to listen closely to understand what's going on.<br/><br/>Occasionally, I do a little Reader's Theater with students. If I send you any scripted student parts ahead of time, print a copy for EACH session and cut into pieces, if needed.<br/><br/>During the Visit<br/><br/>When I discuss a book, if you have that printed book, please hold it up for students to see.<br/><br/>You are my proxy. I often can't call on students and hear individual replies. So, I might say, "We're going to get 3 ideas. Raise your hand if you have an idea." Then YOU take over, call on three students, and announce those answers to everyone in the room and to me.<br/><br/>Choose confident, outgoing students for scripted student parts (if I send any ahead of time). During my in-person school visits, I try to draw out some of the less confident students, but I've found that this doesn't work as well during virtual visits because I can't hear them.<br/><br/>Have students with speaking parts sit up front. When it's time, have them stand up and remind them to speak loudly.<br/><br/>In virtual visits, behavior management falls solely on you. I often can't see exactly what's going on, so do please step in as needed. If there's a big disruption, just ask me to hold on for a moment so that I don't chatter on while nobody's paying attention:>)<br/><br/>Feel free to take pictures of me on-screen and share on social media–even though pictures of me often look ridiculous because I'm making funny faces or something while I read!<br/><br/>If you have any questions at all, please just ask, either before or during the visit!<br/><br/>Scheduling a Virtual Session<br/><br/>Are you interested in scheduling a virtual visit with me? Just email me to set up a date, and we'll go from there | Autori külastused Zoomi või Skype'i kaudu<br/><br/>Olen põnevil, et külastada oma õpilaste kaudu Zoom või Skype! Skype on suurepärane võimalus koolid / klassid, kes ei too isiklikult autorid, kuid kes soovivad uurida raamatuid ja luule, ühendada autor ja esitada üks-ühele küsimusi.<br/><br/>Kulud<br/><br/>Ma pakun 30-45-minutilise Zoomi või Skype'i külastusi koolidega $ 125 seansi kohta (või $ 200 kahe seansi jaoks, mis toimuvad kolme tunni jooksul hommikul või pärastlõunal; $ 325 kolme seansi jaoks ühel päeval; $ 425 nelja seansi jaoks ühel päeval). Igal seansil püüan lapsi võimalikult aktiivselt kaasata. Ei, see ei ole samasugune seos kui isikliku külastuse pakkumine, kuid see võib siiski lastele inspireerida ja motiveerida!<br/><br/>Mida ma teen<br/><br/>Iga seanss kuni 50 õpilast sisaldab:<br/><br/>Viis minutit tehnikat<br/><br/>3 segmendid 10ish-minutit iga — Sa valida:<br/><br/>Kuidas minust sai kirjanik<br/><br/>Selle raamatu kirjutamine (teie valite, millisele raamatule ma keskendun)<br/><br/>Lugemine (loen mõned luuletused ja lapsed aitavad mul lugeda teisi)<br/><br/>Klassiruumi esitlus (teie õpilased panevad mulle lugemise või etenduse - väga tänulik publik!)<br/><br/>Luuletuse kirjutamine koos<br/><br/>Küsimuste ja vastuste seanss<br/><br/>5 minutit pakkimist/hüvastijätmist<br/><br/>Samuti vestlen luulest ja kirjutamisest koolieelsete õpetajate klasside või täiendõpetajate gruppidega.<br/><br/>Näpunäiteid suurepäraseks virtuaalseks külastuseks<br/><br/>Näpunäiteid edukaks virtuaalseks külastuseks<br/><br/>Üks minu virtuaalkooli külastuste eesmärke on jäädvustada interaktiivsust, mis muudab isiklikud külastused edukaks ja lõbusaks. Kuid tõde on see, et mõnikord on raske olla virtuaalselt interaktiivne! Ajastus ei pruugi õigesti sünkroonida, mis muudab lugemise koos väljakutseks ja mul on tõesti raske kuulda üksikuid õpilasi, kui nad ei tule ja räägivad otse mikrofoni / arvutisse. Aga pärast mõningaid katseid ja vigu, Olen avastanud mõned viisid on parim virtuaalne külastused võimalik. Siin nad on: 10 kuidas teha minu visiidi oma õpilastele suurepärane kogemus!<br/><br/>Enne külastust<br/><br/>Saada lapsed nii põnevil kui võimalik külastada. Külasta minu kodulehel koos nendega. Loe mõned minu raamatud koos nendega. Koguda mõned küsimused õpilased on mulle. Kõik, mida teete enne tähtaega, et tunda end suure tehinguna, läheb kaugele õpilaste kaasamise suunas.<br/><br/>Asetage videokaamera või sülearvuti veebikaameraga nii, et ma näen nii palju publikut kui võimalik. Õpilaste kaasamist on raske hinnata, kui ma näen ainult paar õpilast.<br/><br/>Piirata iga rühma 50 õpilast. See on uskumatult raske kaasata suuri gruppe läbi video.<br/><br/>Ma liigun kiiresti teemalt teemale või luuletusele. Palun tuletage õpilastele meelde, et nad peavad tähelepanelikult kuulama, et mõista, mis toimub.<br/><br/>Mõnikord teen õpilastega natuke Readeri teatrit. Kui ma saadan teile skriptitud õpilase osad enne tähtaega, printige koopia iga seansi jaoks ja lõigake vajadusel tükkideks.<br/><br/>Külastuse ajal<br/><br/>Kui ma räägin raamatust, kui teil on see trükitud raamat, palun hoidke seda õpilastele näha.<br/><br/>Sa oled minu esindaja. Sageli ei saa ma õpilastele helistada ja kuulda individuaalseid vastuseid. Nii et ma võin öelda: "Me saame 3 ideed. Tõsta oma käsi, kui teil on idee." Siis võtate üle, helistate kolmele õpilasele ja teatate nendest vastustest kõigile ruumis ja mulle.<br/><br/>Vali kindel, väljaminev õpilased skriptitud õpilase osad (kui ma saadan mis tahes enne tähtaega). Oma isiklike koolikülastuste ajal püüan välja tuua mõned vähem enesekindlad õpilased, kuid olen leidnud, et see ei tööta nii hästi virtuaalsete külastuste ajal, sest ma ei kuule neid.<br/><br/>Las õpilased, kellel on kõnelevad osad, istuvad ees. Kui on aeg, lase neil püsti tõusta ja tuletada neile meelde, et nad räägiksid valjusti.<br/><br/>Virtuaalsetel külastustel langeb käitumisjuhtimine ainult teile. Ma ei näe sageli täpselt, mis toimub, nii et palun astuge sisse vastavalt vajadusele. Kui on suur segadus, paluge mul hetkeks kinni hoida, et ma ei lobiseks, kui keegi ei pööra tähelepanu:>)<br/><br/>Julgelt pildistada mind ekraanil ja jagada sotsiaalmeedias-isegi kui pildid minust näevad sageli naeruväärsed, sest ma teen naljakaid nägusid või midagi, kui ma loen!<br/><br/>Kui teil on üldse küsimusi, küsige palun kas enne külastust või külastuse ajal!<br/><br/>Virtuaalse seansi planeerimine<br/><br/>Kas olete huvitatud ajakava virtuaalne visiit koos minuga? Lihtsalt saatke mulle määrata kuupäev, ja me läheme sealt |

On the one hand it has prompted stigma and violence and on the other it has brought about constructive and supportive responses from various individuals and groups. A new book, Acting on HIV, edited by Prof. Dennis Francis, Dean of the Faculty of Education at the University of the Free State, looks at how drama can be used to promote vital social change as well as individual behavioural change.<br/><br/>Acting on HIV offers a systematic inquiry into drama as an approach to discuss HIV/AIDS and related attitudes and behaviours. The book is a scholarly text and includes the work of some twenty exceptionally creative authors. Contributing authors to the book include, amongst others, Proff. Hazel Barnes (University of the Witwatersrand), Rob Pattman (Stellenbosch University) and Yvonne Sliep from the University of KwaZulu-Natal.<br/><br/>"This project started in 2009 and has taken much of my time to bring together the work of exceptionally creative authors. The research that is communicated through the book is original and timely and makes a significant contribution to conversations about the role/s and significance of drama in addressing issues of HIV & AIDS," says Prof. Francis | Uudiste arhiiv<br/><br/>Uus raamat uurib võimalusi HIV-probleemide lahendamiseks<br/><br/>2011-11-29<br/><br/>Professor Dennis Francis koos Marjorie Humaniga, kes kujundas raamatu kaane "Tegutsemine HIV-iga".<br/><br/>HIV-pandeemia on välja toonud inimeste parimad ja halvimad reageerimise osas. Ühelt poolt on see ajendanud häbimärgistamist ja vägivalda ning teiselt poolt on see toonud kaasa konstruktiivseid ja toetavaid vastuseid erinevatelt üksikisikutelt ja rühmadelt. Vaba Riigi Ülikooli haridusteaduskonna dekaani prof Dennis Francise toimetatud uus raamat "Tegutsemine HIV-iga" uurib, kuidas draamat saab kasutada elutähtsate sotsiaalsete muutuste ja individuaalsete käitumismuutuste edendamiseks.<br/><br/>HIV-ga tegelemine pakub süstemaatilist uurimist draama kui lähenemist HIV / AIDSi ja sellega seotud hoiakute ja käitumise arutamiseks. Raamat on teaduslik tekst ja sisaldab umbes kahekümne erakordselt loomingulise autori tööd. Raamatu autorid on muu hulgas proff Hazel Barnes (Witwatersrandi ülikool), Rob Pattman (Stellenboschi ülikool) ja Yvonne Sliep KwaZulu-Natali ülikoolist.<br/><br/>"See projekt algas 2009. aastal ja on võtnud palju aega, et tuua kokku erakordselt loominguliste autorite töö. Raamatu kaudu edastatav uurimus on originaalne ja õigeaegne ning annab olulise panuse vestlustesse draama rollist ja tähtsusest HIVi ja AIDSi probleemide lahendamisel, "ütleb professor Francis. |

Since Lara Croft's first videogame appearance in Tomb Raider (1996), her exploits as an adventurous and quick-witted explorer have resonated widely with players, earning her a place in the pantheon of great pop culture characters.

The studio was looking for a lead character for their upcoming a 3D adventure game for PlayStation 1. A game in a 3rd person perspective where players would see the main character in full throughout every scene.<br/><br/>As the game was about 'raiding mysterious tombs deep under pyramids,' the lead character would need to look adventurous, and have the brains to survive complex raiding missions. After some deliberation, Lara Croft was born, a young, upper-class and utterly British woman, who was as enigmatic and intelligent as she was tough and self-reliant.<br/><br/>Success and controversy<br/><br/>Tomb Raider (1996) was a breakaway success for Core Design, who quickly doubled down on building Tomb Raider 2 (1997) and 3 (1998). A big part of the success was attributed to the games' leading lady, who found admirers both with male and female players. This baffled critics who just saw Lara Croft as a sexist cartoon.<br/><br/>Explore The World of Lara Croft in Storyworld<br/><br/>This exhibition explores the successful franchise in-depth. It looks at the history of the games and why its leading lady resonates with so many people. It also dives into the mystery of what makes Tomb Raider games tick, from the deep world building to the clever puzzles and traps, and from fantastic enemy and monster designs to the character design of the legendary heroine.<br/><br/>After all, mysteries are there to explore, and have been for the past 25 years.<br/><br/>Tickets<br/><br/>Buy your tickets for Storyworld online with a start date and entry time from Wednesday December 22.

| Real Estate Word of the Day: Option<br/><br/>Option: An agreement to keep open, for a set period, an offer to sell or lease real property. An option can be used, for example, to give the buyer time to resolve questions of financing, title, zoning and feasibility before committing the buyer to purchase. Options are frequently used in the land assemblage process. The option must be supported by its actual consideration, separate and independent of the purchase price of the property. Mere recital of consideration alone is not sufficient except in a lease-option in which the provisions of the lease are themselves sufficient consideration to support the option. An option merely creates a contractual right; it does not give the optionee any estate in the property. At the time the option is signed, the owner does not sell, nor does the buyer purchase, the property. Although the owner is obligated to sell if given notice by the buyer, the buyer is not obligated to purchase. An option to buy is also known as a call; an option to sell is known as a put. | Kinnisvara päeva sõna: valik<br/><br/>Variant: kokkulepe, mis hoiab teatud aja jooksul kinni pakkumise müüa või liisida kinnisvara. Optsiooni võib kasutada näiteks selleks, et anda ostjale aega lahendada finantseerimist, tiitlit, tsoneerimist ja teostatavust puudutavad küsimused enne ostjale ostukohustuse võtmist. Valikud on sageli kasutusel maa kokkupaneku protsessis. Optsiooni peab toetama selle tegelik tasu, mis on eraldiseisev ja sõltumatu kinnisvara ostuhinnast. Ainuüksi kaalutlusest ei piisa, välja arvatud rendioptsiooni puhul, kus renditingimused ise on optsiooni toetamiseks piisavad kaalutlused. Optsioon loob lihtsalt lepingulise õiguse; see ei anna optsiooni saajale vara. Optsiooni allkirjastamise ajal ei müü omanik ega ostja osta vara. Kuigi omanik on kohustatud müüma, kui ostja on sellest ette teatanud, ei ole ostja kohustatud ostma. Ostuoptsiooni nimetatakse ka ostuks; müügioptsiooni nimetatakse müügiks. |
| Benefits of Carotenoids for the Skin<br/><br/>Have you heard of carotenoids? These powerful phytochemicals are the pigmented constituents found in plants that give flowers, fruits, and leaves their yellow, orange and red colours.<br/><br/>Since the 1930s, scientists have identified about 800 carotenoids and about 40 are found in the human body, including the outermost layer of the epidermis, the dermis and subcutaneous fat. The most common carotenoids are beta-carotene, alpha-carotene, lutein, zeaxanthin, lycopene, and astaxanthin. You can read more about astaxanthin here.<br/><br/>The content of carotenoids in the skin is influenced by numerous factors, including the intake of fruits and vegetables, their bioavailability from various foods, supplementation, exposure to UV radiation, air pollution, alcohol consumption, smoking and stress.<br/><br/>How do Carotenoids Help My Skin?<br/><br/>Carotenoids are some of the best-known antioxidants for the skin and they also have important functions as anti-inflammatory agents.<br/><br/>Healthy Aging and Skin Repair<br/><br/>Antioxidants are essential for healthy skin because they help to prevent free radical damage to cells. Free radical damage causes premature aging and the onset of various types of skin cancers. Carotenoids, along with vitamin E, vitamin C, and Co enzyme Q10 are important dermal antioxidants.<br/><br/>Due to their antioxidant activity, carotenoids support and encourage collagen and elastin production in the skin. This helps to increase the skin's density, thickness, elasticity, and firmness. Collagen and elastin decrease as we age, so getting enough carotenoids in the diet and topically is critical for aging well.<br/><br/>Carotenoids can improve the signs of photoaging, skin discolouration, elasticity, hydration, texture, and can reduce transepidermal water loss.<br/><br/>Astaxanthin in particular stimulates fibroblasts to produce collagen and elastin, inhibits the activity of the enzymes that breakdown collagen and elastin, and shows anti-inflammatory and UV-filtering effects. It has been shown to reduce melanin in the skin, which results in the decrease in the appearance of freckles and melasma.<br/><br/>Anti-acne activity: the anti-inflammatory activity of carotenoids helps to dampen the inflammation and irritation associated with acne. Carotenoids also help to normalize and balance oil secretions from the sebaceous glands. They are valuable agents in skin repair and they stimulate epidermal regeneration, helping to smooth and soften skin.<br/><br/>Where Can I Find Carotenoids?<br/><br/>There are two ways to get your daily dose of carotenoids: through diet and through topical application. The combination of both is the ideal approach to well-aging skincare.<br/><br/>Carotenoids are fat-soluble, so your body needs fat to absorb them (think tomatoes and olive oil, broccoli and butter, or spinach and avocado). Common sources of carotenoids in food are avocado, egg yolks, kale, spinach, carrots, sweet potatoes, papaya, and tomatoes.<br/><br/>While we advocate getting as many of your nutrients and antioxidants as you can from food rather than supplementation; one study showed that astaxanthin combined with collagen hydrolysate significantly improved barrier integrity, reduced transepidermal water loss, and increased the expression of procollagen type I mRNA.<br/><br/>Topical application is key to healthy skin. Studies show that high concentrations of antioxidants in human skin offer the best protection for healthy skin at any age.<br/><br/>At Sarka Botanicals, we blend carotenoid-rich, whole plants such as calendula, dandelion, and extracts like astaxanthin with cold-pressed oils and functional ingredients. Calendula alone contains over 19 different types of carotenoids. This may explain why it has such a long history of use in skin care. Studies show that carotenoids blended with co-enzyme Q10 are especially effective at reducing inflammation and slowing premature skin aging due to sun exposure. | Karotenoidide eelised nahale<br/><br/>Kas olete kuulnud karotenoididest? Need võimsad fütokemikaalid on pigmenteerunud komponendid, mida leidub taimedes, mis annavad lilli, puuvilju ja jätavad oma kollase, oranži ja punase värvi.<br/><br/>Alates 1930. aastatest on teadlased tuvastanud umbes 800 karotenoide ja umbes 40 leidub inimkehas, sealhulgas epidermise välimine kiht, dermis ja nahaalune rasv. Kõige tavalisemad karotenoidid on beeta-karoteen, alfa-karoteen, luteiin, zeaksantiin, lükopeen ja astaksantiin. Lisateavet astaksantiini kohta saate lugeda siit.<br/><br/>Karotenoidide sisaldust nahas mõjutavad mitmed tegurid, sealhulgas puu- ja köögiviljade tarbimine, nende biosaadavus erinevatest toitudest, täiendamine, kokkupuude UV-kiirgusega, õhusaaste, alkoholi tarbimine, suitsetamine ja stress.<br/><br/>Kuidas aitavad karotenoidid mu nahka?<br/><br/>Karotenoidid on mõned kõige tuntumad naha antioksüdandid ja neil on ka oluline roll põletikuvastaste ainetena.<br/><br/>Tervislik vananemine ja naha remont<br/><br/>Antioksüdandid on oluline terve nahk, sest nad aitavad vältida vabade radikaalide rakkude kahjustusi. Vabade radikaalide kahjustused põhjustab enneaegset vananemist ja algust eri tüüpi nahavähi. Karotenoidid koos E-vitamiini, C-vitamiini ja Co ensüümiga Q10 on olulised naha antioksüdandid.<br/><br/>Karotenoidide antioksüdantne toime toetab ja soodustab kollageeni ja elastiini tootmist nahas. See aitab suurendada naha tihedust, paksust, elastsust ja tugevust. Kollageen ja elastiin vähenevad vananedes, nii et saada piisavalt karotenoide toidus ja paikselt on oluline vananemise hästi.<br/><br/>Karotenoidid võivad parandada fotovananemise märke, naha värvimuutust, elastsust, hüdratsiooni, tekstuuri ja võib vähendada transepidermaalset veekadu.<br/><br/>Astaksantiin stimuleerib eelkõige fibroblastide kollageeni ja elastiini tootmist, pärsib kollageeni ja elastiini lagundavate ensüümide aktiivsust ning omab põletikuvastast ja UV-filtreerivat toimet. On näidatud, et see vähendab melaniini nahas, mille tulemuseks on tedretähnide ja melasma välimuse vähenemine.<br/><br/>Aknevastane toime: karotenoidide põletikuvastane toime aitab vähendada aknega seotud põletikku ja ärritust. Karotenoidid aitavad ka normaliseerida ja tasakaalustada õli sekretsiooni rasunäärmetest. Nad on kasulikud ained naha parandamisel ja stimuleerivad epidermise taastumist, aidates nahka siluda ja pehmendada.<br/><br/>Kust ma leian karotenoide?<br/><br/>Karotenoidide päevase annuse saamiseks on kaks võimalust: dieedi ja paiksete rakenduste kaudu. Mõlema kombinatsioon on ideaalne lähenemine hästi vananevale nahahooldusele.<br/><br/>Karotenoidid on rasvlahustuvad, nii et keha vajab rasva, et neid absorbeerida (mõtle tomatid ja oliiviõli, brokoli ja või või spinat ja avokaado). Karotenoidide ühised allikad toidus on avokaado, munakollased, kapsas, spinat, porgandid, magus kartul, papaia ja tomatid.<br/><br/>Kuigi me soovitame saada nii palju toitaineid ja antioksüdante kui võimalik toidust, mitte toidulisanditest, näitas üks uuring, et astaksantiin koos kollageeni hüdrolüsaadiga parandas oluliselt barjääri terviklikkust, vähendas transepidermaalset veekadu ja suurendas prokollageeni I tüüpi mRNA ekspressiooni.<br/><br/>Aktuaalne kasutamine on terve naha võti. Uuringud näitavad, et antioksüdantide kõrge kontsentratsioon inimese nahas pakub parimat kaitset terve naha igas vanuses.<br/><br/>Sarka Botanicalsis segame karotenoid-rikas, terveid taimi nagu saialill, võilill ja ekstraktid nagu astaksantiin külmpressitud õlide ja funktsionaalsete koostisosadega. Ainuüksi saialill sisaldab üle 19 erinevat tüüpi karotenoide. Uuringud näitavad, et koensüümi Q10-ga segatud karotenoidid on eriti tõhusad põletiku vähendamisel ja päikese käes viibimise tõttu enneaegse naha vananemise aeglustamisel. |
