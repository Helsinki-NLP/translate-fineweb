In simple terms, the condition is characterized by: one develops a kidney disease and undergoes a kidney transplant and other diseases associated with acidic concentration in the blood and gout. In theory, the condition will occur even if the genetic change is inherited from one parent and sporadically occurs when there is no family history.<br/><br/>Common names of autosomal dominant interstitial kidney disease<br/><br/>The condition has other names as well namely: medullary cystic kidney disease, although this name is not used as much because most people suffering from this condition do not have medullary cysts. It is also referred to as juvenile hyperuricemic nephropathy. The disease tends to affect people of ages 20 to 50. The latter condition as aforementioned occurs in young children, something, which translate to get it from both parents.<br/>Cystic kidney disease is an inherited condition whereby the cysts in the centre of each kidney gradually lose their ability to function properly. Cysts refer to abnormal blisters of fluid in the kidney. The condition further scares the kidney making unable to concentrate the urine and as a result, producing too much urine. Its symptoms include excessive urination, salt cravings, weakness, confusion, bleeding, fatigue, frequent hiccups, low blood pressure, nausea and vomiting, headaches, pale skin, reduced sensation in the hands, weight loss among many others. Other complications include: anemia, ulcers, loss of bone density, infertility and other heart related problems.<br/>Its analysis incorporates blood tests to check for sodium levels and general kidney functions, urine tests to check the levels of concentration and other imbalances, x rays to check for the size of kidneys that may be altered owing to increased urine concentrations, renal biopsy and genetic testing to verify any genetic changes that might have taken place in due time.<br/>While the disease does not have a cut and dry treatment to it, one may focus on controlling measures, which include intake of fluids and salt to supplement the one lost as the disease progresses into latter stages. This also helps reduce dehydration. Other treatments include taking of prescribed medication and diet changes and minimal intakes of foods containing phosphorous and potassium. Further complications may also require one to have a kidney transplant. Basically, this is not a curable disease but rather a manageable once detected in the early stages.<br/><br/>The common yet different factor of Autosomal dominant interstitial kidney disease<br/><br/>Nephronophthisis and medullary cystic kidney disease are mainly grouped together because, in essence, they share the same features but with a slight difference in regards inheritance patterns to the former affecting children and the latter affecting young adults and older age groups. Similar features for both are ADH resistant urine concentration that leads to polyuria and polydipsia, anemia and renal diseases.<br/>The former aforementioned condition is Autosomal recessive accounting to 15% of chronic diseases and causes ESRD during early childhood while the latter is Autosomal dominant with a few sporadic new mutations and causes ESRD for people between the ages of 30 and 50. | Online CPR sertifitseerimise blogi<br/><br/>Kuupäev: Juuli 23, 2014<br/><br/>Autosoom-dominantne interstitsiaalne neeruhaigus on haruldane haiguste kogum, mis mõjutab neerude teadaolevaid funktsioone.

| Hobbes' vs. Locke's Account on the State of Nature<br/><br/>Topic: PhilosophyWords: 2539Pages: 9Aug 3rd, 2021<br/><br/>Hobbes and Locke are among the most influential political philosophers to ever write in English. The state of nature, which precedes the organization of the complex societies, is the common premise that both Hobbes and Locke share but interpret in different ways. The former views humans in their natural state as equally dangerous and free to pursue their egoistic goals unrestricted by the nonexistent notions of justice, which is why his natural state amounts to the "war of every man against every man" (Hobbes76). The latter, on the other hand, views humans in their original condition as equally valuable and restricts natural freedom by the idea of justice that requires not to harm others, which allows defining the state of nature as "mutual assistance and preservation" rather than war (Locke 15). The key difference between the two philosophers' accounts of natural state is that Locke uses ethical considerations while Hobbes does not, and it ultimately leads Hobbes to envisage a state exercising unlimited power over human beings, while Locke limits the government by the moral principles, which he considers a natural law.<br/><br/>Hobbes bases his assumptions regarding the state of nature on the fact that all people are roughly equal in their physical and mental capabilities. He admits that some individuals may demonstrate greater physical strength or superior intellect but insists that "when all is reckoned together, the difference between man and man is not so considerable" (Hobbes 74). Since humans are roughly equal in their capabilities, they also have similar hopes to attain their ends and satisfy their needs (Hobbes 75). As a logical outcome of this equality, when the people begin competing for scarce resources, no one may feel entirely secure in his or her possessions. Even if a mighty, cunning, and capable person succeeds in subjugating "the persons of all men he can," it still does not guarantee the ultimate security (Hobbes 75). As no human can obtain such superiority over the others that renders him or her utterly immune to their strength of intellect, no human can feel completely safe when surrounded by his or her equals. Hobbes' equality in the natural state is equality of fear, where all humans view each other as dangerous competitors.<br/><br/>Just as Hobbes, Locke considers all human beings to be fundamentally equal, but assigns a very different meaning to the term. From his perspective, it is not the equality of capabilities, but, rather, the equality of value. He opines that the people "promiscuously born to all the same advantages of nature" should logically enjoy the perfect equality among them, as there is no reason to consider anyone inherently more valuable (Locke 8). The only possible foundation for designating some people as superior to others would be if God "by any manifest declaration of his will, set one above another" (Locke 8). Since such divine sanction of superiority is absent, Locke concludes that the natural equality of all representatives of humankind is not to be called into question. Hobbes approaches equality pragmatically and stresses that people in their natural state are equally dangerous, but Locke employs an ethical approach and emphasizes that humans are equally valuable in God's eyes. This disagreement is but the first difference between the two authors based on the fact that Locke includes God as a premise into his political philosophy, while Hobbes does not.<br/><br/>Another characteristic feature of Hobbes' account of the natural state is his interpretation of liberty. According to Hobbes, the state of nature implies unlimited freedom to do whatever is necessary for one's continued existence. The philosopher defines liberty as "the absence of external impediments" in using one's abilities to attain one's goals (Hobbes 79). The primary purpose of every sentient being is to maintain its continued existence. As a consequence, Hobbesian freedom amounts to the unhindered opportunity to do anything that, in one's judgment, would be best suited to preserve one's life and possessions (Hobbes 79). The only limitation to liberty is that a person cannot do anything contradictory to sustaining his or her life or destroying "the means of preserving the same" (Hobbes 79). Apart from that, there are no boundaries, and everyone has "a right to everything, even to one another's body" if that furthers one's survival (Hobbes 80). Thus, natural liberty, as viewed by Hobbes, is the absence of externally enforced obstacles in pursuing one's right to everything to sustain and secure one's continued existence.<br/><br/>Locke also upholds the idea of natural liberty but, unsurprisingly, approaches it in a manner that is significantly different from that of Hobbes. As soon as he begins discussing liberty in the state of nature, he immediately notes that a state of freedom does not equate "a state of license" (Locke 9). The philosopher identifies two specific limitations to human freedom in the state of nature. The first one is identical to that introduce by Hobbes: however free and independent, a person nevertheless "has not liberty to destroy himself" (Locke 9). Yet the second limitation contradicts Hobbes' prepositions directly. According to Locke, every human being has a natural obligation not to "harm another in his life, health, liberty, or possessions" (9). Just as with his interpretation of equality, the author bases this assertion on ethical and religious grounds: people should preserve each other's existence since they are all creations of the same "omnipotent, and infinitely wise maker" (Locke 9). Thus, Locke's limits liberty in the natural state far more stringently than Hobbes by introducing the obligation to refrain from harming both oneself and the others.<br/><br/>The differences between the two authors also manifest in their accounts of justice in the natural state of humanity. As far as Hobbes is concerned, delineating just and unjust practices is merely the matter of the law. There is no jurisprudence in the state of nature, and the only law governing human beings in their original condition is a natural law that only obliges them to seek personal security. As a result, nothing can be unjust in the original state of the humankind: "notions of right and wrong justice and injustice" have no place and no meaning in the absence of the stringently enforced law (Hobbes 78). As long as the people use their virtually unlimited freedom to ruthlessly compete with each other for resources, to which they are equally entitled, they have no criteria to differentiate between just and unjust actions. Therefore, the Hobbesian state of nature defies the very idea of justice since the author interprets it as a mere function of the formalized and established law.<br/><br/>Locke assigns different meaning to justice and views it not so much in legislative as in the ethical terms. This paper already mentioned that, unlike Hobbes, Locke employs ethical notions and generally bases his political philosophy on moral rather than purely practical presumptions. Locke's natural law, unlike that of Hobbes, obliges human beings to take care of each other rather than simply leaving everyone to fend for themselves. As a result, there is a place for justice and injustice in his state of nature. The author points to this fact himself when noting that no one should deprive another of his or her life of the means of preserving it "unless it be to do justice on an offender" (Locke 9). This statement reveals with the utmost clarity that, according to Locke, there is justice in the state of nature, and, moreover, humans have to preserve it actively. The criterion of justice, which Hobbes' natural state lacks, is the second limitation on natural liberty imposed by Locke: an action is unjust if it constitutes an unwarranted threat to another person's life and possessions.<br/><br/>These differences in the two authors' treatment of equality, liberty, and justice or injustice culminate in their interpretation of the relationship between the state of nature and the state of war. From Hobbes's perspective, the two are synonymous, because the ruthless competition is the only logical outcome of putting people with equivalent capabilities and similar needs in an environment with limited resources. He states this connection outright: "if any two men desire the same thing, which nevertheless they cannot both enjoy, they become enemies" and are, therefore, in the state of war with each other (Hobbes 75). Yet since humans are numerous and all possess similar capabilities and needs, this competition manifests not only in the individual interactions but also on the level of humanity as a whole. As long as all humans have equal and unlimited rights to all resources and even to each other's bodies and lives, the state of nature is a war of "every man against every man" (Hobbes 76). This grim interpretation stems directly from Hobbes' portrayal of the state of nature as governed solely by the individuals' egoistic urges.<br/><br/>Locke, on the other hand, differentiates between the state of nature and the state of war and points out that, while they may occur simultaneously, it is no reason to identify one with the other. Locke's definition of the state of war is virtually identical to that offered by Hobbes. According to Locke, "he who attempts to get another man into his absolute power does thereby put himself into a state of war with him" (14). This explanation lines up perfectly with the Hobbesian notion that everyone's universal right to everything, including the other people's bodies and lives, leads to the state of war. Yet Locke refuses to equate the state of war and the state of nature precisely because he denies Hobbes' interpretation of natural freedom. Since Locke's natural state restrains people from harming each other through the second limitation of liberty, an attempt on another person's freedom is a transgression against the natural law. While for Hobbes, war is the humankind's condition by default, Locke portrays it as a perversion of the state of nature rather than its rule.<br/><br/>These differences in delineating the state on nature and its constituents, such as liberty, equality, justice, and war, pave the way to the authors contrasting portrayals of government. Based on his pessimistic assessment of the state of nature, the author of Leviathan concludes that, under conditions of war, there can be no definite hope for "living out the time which nature ordinarily alloweth men to live" (Hobbes 80). The solution is laying down the universal right to everything and leaving everyone "so much liberty against other men, as he would allow other men against himself" (Hobbes 80). The participants of the resulting social contract invest the unlimited liberties they have surrendered into a sovereign – the bearer of the supreme power whose purpose is to preserve the achieved status quo by punishing all transgressions against it. Sovereign's power is absolute: the ruler has the authority "to do whatsoever he shall think necessary" to promote peace between his subjects so that no one would assail another's life or property (113). Hobbes concludes that without such an unassailable figure entitled with the right to do anything to the subjects, there can be no peace and no guarantee of security.<br/><br/>While Locke agrees with the necessity of creating politically organized societies, he nevertheless opposes Hobbes' idea of the sovereign power as unlimited and unassailable. As mentioned above, Locke's state of nature is not nearly as dreadful as that painted by Hobbes because of the people's obligation to preserve not only themselves but each other as well. Therefore, the need for social contract arises not from the fear of the others, but from the sheer convenience. Small communities may not need numerous laws to solve conflicts and "officers to superintend the process," but larger associations find it advisable to institute governments for that purpose (Locke 57). Yet the power of the government cannot be unlimited because it would result in subduing the subjects to an "inconstant, uncertain, unknown, arbitrary will of another man" (Locke 17). Such a government would constitute a twofold violation of the natural law. By agreeing to another person's absolute power over his life, a subject would violate its first limitation prohibiting to harm oneself. As for the ruler, destroying another person's liberty would constitute direct harm and, as such, be contradictory to the second limitation.<br/><br/>As a direct continuation of his case for unlimited governmental authority, Hobbes denies the separation of powers as a principle. From his perspective, the sovereign, once instituted, possesses "the whole power of prescribing the rules" governing the lives of the subjects or, in shorter terms, the legislative power (Hobbes 114). The sovereign also reserves the right of "hearing and deciding all controversies" – that is, the judicial power (Hobbes 114). Finally, since the entire purpose of the sovereign is to force the subjects to refrain from harming each other, there can be no doubt that executive power is also his or her exclusive prerogative. The separation of powers as a concept is alien to Hobbes because of his views on the state of nature. Creating a political entity where the executive, legislative, and judicial branches would check each other – that is, compete – would mean recreating the Hobbesian state of nature-as-war on a higher level. Since the people enter a social contract and institute a government to put the state of nature behind them, not reinstate it in a different form, the separation of powers contradictory Hobbes' views directly.<br/><br/>Locke, on the other hand, embraces separation of power as a foundational principle of his political theory. His case for the separation is evident in the discussion of the limits of the legislative power. As Locke puts it, it would be hardly advisable "for the same persons, who have the power of making laws, to have also in their hands the power to execute them" (76). The philosopher points to the imperfections of human nature and the inherent desire to "grasp at power" as a rationale for this precautionary measure (Locke 76). Just as in Hobbes' case, Locke's account of the separation of powers stems directly from his interpretation of the state of nature. If there is already justice in the state of nature and the people can understand it, any government is inevitably subject to the same natural law. Since absolute power over people violates both limitations of this law, separating and distributing it is advisable so that the government would function appropriately.<br/><br/>This paper has demonstrated that, while the differences between Hobbes' and Locke's accounts of the natural state of humanity are numerous, they ultimately amount to the presence of absence of moral premises. Hobbes views the natural state as that of unlimited liberty, where people endowed with equal capabilities and not bound by any moral notions, such as justice, compete for the resources unceasingly. Locke, however, interprets equality and liberty ethically rather than practically and opines that war is a perversion of the natural state, as the natural law obliges humans not to harm each other. This disagreement influences the philosophers' approaches to government. Hobbes insists on an all-powerful ruler, as, in the absence of ethical restraints, no other authority could force the humans to refrain from harming each other. Yet, in Locke's view, granting the government unlimited powers would be contradictory to the ethical limitations embedded in the law of nature, which is why he, unlike Hobbes, advocates separation of powers. | Hobbes vs. Locke's Account on State of Nature<br/><br/>Teema: FilosoofiaSõnad: 2539Pages: 9Aug 3rd, 2021<br/><br/>Hobbes ja Locke on üks mõjukamaid poliitilisi filosoofe, kes on kunagi kirjutanud inglise keeles. Looduse seisund, mis eelneb keerukate ühiskondade organiseerumisele, on ühine eeldus, et nii Hobbes kui ka Locke jagavad, kuid tõlgendavad erinevalt. Endised näevad inimesi oma loomulikus seisundis võrdselt ohtlikena ja vabadena taotlema oma egoistlikke eesmärke, ilma et neid piiraksid õigusemõistmise olematud mõisted, mistõttu tema loomulik seisund ongi "iga inimese sõda iga inimese vastu" (Hobbes76). Teisest küljest näeb viimane inimesi nende algses seisukorras võrdselt väärtuslikuna ja piirab loomulikku vabadust õigluse ideega, mis nõuab teiste mitte kahjustamist, mis võimaldab määratleda loodusseisundit kui "vastastikust abi ja säilitamist", mitte sõda (Locke 15). Peamine erinevus kahe filosoofi loomuliku oleku kirjelduste vahel on see, et Locke kasutab eetilisi kaalutlusi, samas kui Hobbes seda ei tee, ja see viib lõpuks Hobbesi ettekujutuseni, et riik kasutab piiramatut võimu inimeste üle, samal ajal kui Locke piirab valitsust moraalsete põhimõtetega, mida ta peab loodusseaduseks.<br/><br/>Hobbes rajab oma oletused looduse seisundi kohta asjaolule, et kõik inimesed on oma füüsiliste ja vaimsete võimete poolest ligikaudu võrdsed. Ta möönab, et mõned inimesed võivad ilmutada suuremat füüsilist jõudu või kõrgemat intellekti, kuid rõhutab, et „kui kõik kokku arvestada, ei ole inimese ja inimese vaheline erinevus nii märkimisväärne“ (Hobbes 74). Kuna inimesed on oma võimete poolest enam-vähem võrdsed, on neil ka sarnased lootused oma eesmärkide saavutamiseks ja vajaduste rahuldamiseks (Hobbes 75). Selle võrdsuse loogiliseks tagajärjeks on see, et kui inimesed hakkavad võistlema nappide ressursside pärast, ei tunne keegi end oma varanduses täiesti turvaliselt. Isegi kui võimas, osav ja võimekas inimene õnnestub alistada „kõikide inimeste isikuid, keda ta suudab“, ei taga see lõplikku turvalisust (Hobbes 75). Kuna ükski inimene ei suuda saavutada teistest kõrgemat seisundit, mis muudab ta täielikult immuunseks nende intellekti tugevusele, ei saa ükski inimene tunda end täiesti turvaliselt, kui teda ümbritsevad tema võrdsed. Hobbesi võrdsus loomulikus olekus on hirmu võrdsus, kus kõik inimesed näevad üksteist ohtlike konkurentidena.<br/><br/>Nagu Hobbes, peab Locke kõiki inimesi fundamentaalselt võrdseteks, kuid annab terminile väga erineva tähenduse. Tema vaatenurgast ei ole see võimete võrdsus, vaid pigem väärtuse võrdsus. Ta arvab, et inimesed, kes on "loodud samadele looduse eelistele", peaksid loogiliselt nautima täiuslikku võrdsust nende vahel, sest pole põhjust pidada kedagi loomupäraselt väärtuslikumaks (Locke 8). Ainus võimalik alus mõnede inimeste määramiseks teistest kõrgemale oleks see, kui Jumal „paneks oma tahte mis tahes ilmselge avaldusega üksteist kõrgemale“ (Locke 8). Kuna sellist üleoleku jumalikku heakskiitu ei ole, järeldab Locke, et kõigi inimkonna esindajate loomulikku võrdsust ei tohi kahtluse alla seada. Hobbes läheneb võrdsusele pragmaatiliselt ja rõhutab, et inimesed oma loomulikus olekus on võrdselt ohtlikud, kuid Locke kasutab eetilist lähenemist ja rõhutab, et inimesed on Jumala silmis võrdselt väärtuslikud. See erimeelsus on vaid esimene erinevus kahe autori vahel, mis põhineb asjaolul, et Locke lisab Jumala oma poliitilise filosoofia eelduseks, samas kui Hobbes seda ei tee.<br/><br/>Hobbesi loodusseisundi kirjelduse teine iseloomulik tunnus on tema vabaduse tõlgendus. Hobbesi sõnul tähendab looduse seisund piiramatut vabadust teha kõike, mis on vajalik inimese jätkuvaks eksistentsiks. Filosoof defineerib vabadust kui "väliste takistuste puudumist" oma võimete kasutamisel eesmärkide saavutamiseks (Hobbes 79). Iga aistiva olendi esmane eesmärk on säilitada oma jätkuv eksistents. Järelikult on Hobbesi vabadus takistusteta võimalus teha kõike, mis inimese arvates sobib kõige paremini tema elu ja vara säilitamiseks (Hobbes 79). Ainus piirang vabadusele on see, et inimene ei saa teha midagi, mis on vastuolus tema elu ülalpidamisega või "säilitamise vahendite hävitamisega" (Hobbes 79). Peale selle ei ole piire ja igaühel on "õigus kõigele, isegi üksteise kehale", kui see edendab ellujäämist (Hobbes 80). Seega on loomulik vabadus, nagu Hobbes seda näeb, väliselt kehtestatud takistuste puudumine, kui taotletakse oma õigust kõigele, et säilitada ja kindlustada oma jätkuv eksistents.<br/><br/>Locke toetab ka loomuliku vabaduse ideed, kuid ei ole üllatav, et läheneb sellele viisil, mis erineb oluliselt Hobbesi omast. Niipea, kui ta hakkab looduse seisundis vabadust arutama, märgib ta kohe, et vabaduse seisund ei võrdu "loa seisundiga" (Locke 9). Filosoof tuvastab kaks konkreetset piirangut inimese vabadusele looduse seisundis. Esimene on identne Hobbesi sissejuhatusega: ükskõik kui vaba ja sõltumatu inimene ka ei oleks, ei ole tal vabadust ennast hävitada (Locke 9). Ometi on teine piirang otseselt vastuolus Hobbesi prepositsioonidega. Locke'i sõnul on igal inimesel loomulik kohustus mitte kahjustada teist oma elus, tervises, vabaduses ega varanduses. Sarnaselt oma tõlgendusega võrdsusest rajab autor selle väite eetilisele ja religioossele alusele: inimesed peaksid säilitama üksteise eksistentsi, sest nad on kõik ühe ja sama "kõikvõimsa ja lõpmatult targa looja" (Locke 9). Seega piirab Locke vabadust looduses palju rangemalt kui Hobbes, kehtestades kohustuse hoiduda nii enda kui ka teiste kahjustamisest.<br/><br/>Erinevused nende kahe autori vahel ilmnevad ka nende aruannetes õiglusest inimkonna loomulikus seisundis. Mis Hobbesisse puutub, siis õiglaste ja ebaõiglaste tavade piiritlemine on ainult seaduse küsimus. Looduse seisundis puudub kohtupraktika ja ainus seadus, mis reguleerib inimesi nende algses seisukorras, on loodusseadus, mis kohustab neid otsima ainult isiklikku turvalisust. Selle tulemusena ei saa miski inimkonna algses seisukorras olla ebaõiglane: "mõistetel õigest ja valest õiglusest ja ebaõiglusest" ei ole kohta ega tähendust rangelt jõustatud seaduse puudumisel (Hobbes 78). Niikaua kui inimesed kasutavad oma praktiliselt piiramatut vabadust halastamatult konkureerida üksteisega ressursside eest, millele neil on võrdselt õigus, ei ole neil kriteeriume, mis eristaksid õiglast ja ebaõiglast tegevust. Seetõttu trotsib Hobbesi loodusseisund õigluse ideed, kuna autor tõlgendab seda pelgalt vormistatud ja kehtestatud seaduse funktsioonina.<br/><br/>Locke omistab õiglusele erineva tähenduse ja näeb seda mitte niivõrd seadusandlikus kui eetilises mõttes. Selles raamatus on juba mainitud, et erinevalt Hobbesist kasutab Locke eetilisi mõisteid ja rajab oma poliitilise filosoofia üldiselt pigem moraalsetele kui puhtalt praktilistele eeldustele. Locke'i loodusseadus, erinevalt Hobbesi seadusest, kohustab inimesi üksteise eest hoolitsema, selle asemel, et lihtsalt lasta kõigil enda eest hoolitseda. Selle tulemusena on tema looduses koht õiglusele ja ebaõiglusele. Autor juhib sellele faktile ise tähelepanu, märkides, et keegi ei tohiks võtta teiselt tema elust selle säilitamise vahendeid, "kui see ei ole õigusemõistmine kurjategija vastu" (Locke 9). See avaldus näitab ülima selgusega, et Locke'i sõnul on looduses õiglus ja pealegi peavad inimesed seda aktiivselt säilitama. Õigluse kriteerium, mida Hobbesi loomulikus seisundis ei ole, on teine Locke'i kehtestatud loomuliku vabaduse piirang: tegevus on ebaõiglane, kui see kujutab endast põhjendamatut ohtu teise inimese elule ja varale.<br/><br/>Need erinevused võrdsuse, vabaduse ja õigluse või ebaõigluse käsitluses kulmineeruvad nende tõlgenduses looduse ja sõjaseisukorra vahelisest suhtest. Hobbesi vaatenurgast on need kaks sünonüümiks, sest halastamatu konkurents on ainus loogiline tulemus, mis paneb inimesed samaväärsete võimete ja sarnaste vajadustega piiratud ressurssidega keskkonda. Ta ütleb selle seose otse: „Kui kaks inimest ihkavad sama asja, mida nad mõlemad siiski ei saa nautida, saavad neist vaenlased” ja on seetõttu üksteisega sõjaseisukorras (Hobbes 75). Kuid kuna inimesed on arvukad ja neil kõigil on sarnased võimed ja vajadused, ei avaldu see konkurents mitte ainult individuaalses suhtlemises, vaid ka inimkonna tasandil tervikuna. Niikaua kui kõigil inimestel on võrdne ja piiramatu õigus kõigile ressurssidele ning isegi üksteise kehadele ja eludele, on loodusseisund „iga inimese sõda iga inimese vastu“ (Hobbes 76). See sünge tõlgendus tuleneb otseselt Hobbesi pildist looduse seisundist, mida juhivad ainult indiviidi egoistlikud tungid.<br/><br/>Locke seevastu eristab loodus- ja sõjaseisukorda ning juhib tähelepanu sellele, et kuigi need võivad esineda üheaegselt, ei ole põhjust üksteisega samastada. Locke'i sõjaseisukorra definitsioon on praktiliselt identne Hobbesi poolt pakutud definitsiooniga. Locke'i sõnul "see, kes püüab saada teist meest oma absoluutsesse võimu, paneb ennast sellega sõjaseisukorda temaga" (14). See seletus sobib ideaalselt Hobbesi ideega, et igaühe universaalne õigus kõigele, sealhulgas teiste inimeste kehadele ja eludele, viib sõjaseisukorrani. Ometi keeldub Locke võrdsustamast sõjaseisukorda loodusseisundiga just seetõttu, et ta eitab Hobbesi tõlgendust loomulikust vabadusest. Kuna Locke'i loomulik seisund takistab inimesi üksteist kahjustamast teise vabaduse piiramise kaudu, on teise isiku vabaduse püüdmine rikkumine loodusseadusega. Kuigi Hobbesi jaoks on sõda inimkonna vaikimisi seisund, kirjeldab Locke seda pigem looduse seisundi perverssena kui selle reeglina.<br/><br/>Need erinevused riigi iseloomu ja selle valijate, nagu vabadus, võrdsus, õiglus ja sõda, piiritlemisel sillutavad autoritele teed vastandlikele valitsuse kujutistele. Tuginedes oma pessimistlikule hinnangule looduse seisundi kohta, järeldab Leviathani autor, et sõja tingimustes ei saa olla kindlat lootust „elada aega, mida loodus tavaliselt võimaldab inimestel elada“ (Hobbes 80). Lahendus on kehtestada universaalne õigus kõigele ja jätta igaühele „nii palju vabadust teiste inimeste vastu, kui ta lubaks teistel inimestel enda vastu“ (Hobbes 80). Tulemuseks oleva ühiskondliku lepingu osalised investeerivad piiramatud vabadused, mille nad on loovutanud suveräänile – kõrgeima võimu kandjale, kelle eesmärk on säilitada saavutatud status quo, karistades kõiki selle vastu suunatud üleastumisi. Suverääni võim on absoluutne: valitsejal on volitus „teha kõike, mida ta vajalikuks peab”, et edendada rahu oma alamate vahel, nii et keegi ei ründaks teise elu ega vara. Hobbes järeldab, et ilma sellise ründamatu tegelaseta, kellel on õigus subjektidega midagi teha, ei saa olla rahu ega julgeolekut.<br/><br/>Kuigi Locke nõustub poliitiliselt organiseeritud ühiskondade loomise vajadusega, on ta sellegipoolest vastu Hobbesi ideele suveräänsest võimust kui piiramatule ja ründamatule. Nagu eespool mainitud, ei ole Locke'i loodusseisund peaaegu sama kohutav kui Hobbesi maalitud, sest inimestel on kohustus säilitada mitte ainult iseennast, vaid ka üksteist. Seetõttu ei teki sotsiaalse lepingu vajadus mitte teiste hirmust, vaid puhtast mugavusest. Väikesed kogukonnad ei pruugi vajada arvukaid seadusi konfliktide lahendamiseks ja "ametnikud protsessi jälgimiseks", kuid suuremad ühendused leiavad, et on soovitatav luua selleks valitsused (Locke 57). Valitsuse võim ei saa aga olla piiramatu, sest see tooks kaasa alamate allutamise „teise inimese ebakindlale, ebakindlale, tundmatule, meelevaldsele tahtele“ (Locke 17). Nõustudes teise inimese absoluutse võimuga oma elu üle, rikuks subjekt oma esimest piirangut, mis keelab endale kahju teha. Mis valitsejasse puutub, siis teise isiku vabaduse hävitamine kujutaks endast otsest kahju ja oleks sellisena vastuolus teise piiranguga.<br/><br/>Otseselt jätkates oma piiramatu valitsusvõimu juhtumit, eitab Hobbes võimude lahususe põhimõtet. Tema vaatevinklist on suveräänil, kui ta on loodud, „täielik võim kehtestada reegleid“, mis reguleerivad subjektide elu või lühidalt öeldes seadusandlikku võimu (Hobbes 114). Suverään jätab endale ka õiguse "kuulata ja otsustada kõiki vaidlusi" - see tähendab kohtuvõimu (Hobbes 114). Lõpuks, kuna suveräänsuse kogu eesmärk on sundida alamaid üksteist mitte kahjustama, ei saa olla kahtlust, et täidesaatev võim on ka tema ainuõigus. Võimude eraldamine mõistena on Hobbesile võõras, kuna ta näeb looduse seisundit. Poliitilise üksuse loomine, kus täidesaatvad, seadusandlikud ja kohtuvõimud kontrollivad üksteist - see tähendab, konkureerivad - tähendaks Hobbesi looduse kui sõja seisundi taasloomist kõrgemal tasemel. Kuna inimesed sõlmivad ühiskondliku lepingu ja loovad valitsuse, et panna looduse seisund nende taha, mitte taastada see teistsugusel kujul, on võimude lahusus otseselt vastuolus Hobbesi vaadetega.<br/><br/>Locke, teiselt poolt, hõlmab võimu eraldamine aluspõhimõttena oma poliitilise teooria. Tema argument eraldamine on ilmne arutelu piirid seadusandliku võimu. Nagu Locke ütleb, oleks vaevalt soovitatav, et „samadel isikutel, kellel on seaduste tegemise õigus, oleks ka õigus neid täide viia“.[76] Filosoof osutab inimloomuse ebatäiuslikkusele ja loomupärasele soovile „võimust kinni haarata“ kui selle ettevaatusabinõu põhjendusele (Locke 76). Just nagu Hobbesi puhul, tuleneb Locke'i aruanne võimude lahususe kohta otseselt tema tõlgendusest looduse seisundist. Kui looduses on õiglus juba olemas ja inimesed seda mõistavad, siis allub iga valitsus paratamatult samale loodusseadusele. Kuna absoluutne võim inimeste üle rikub selle seaduse mõlemaid piiranguid, on selle eraldamine ja jagamine soovitatav, et valitsus toimiks nõuetekohaselt.<br/><br/>See paber on näidanud, et kuigi erinevused Hobbes'i ja Locke'i aruannetes inimkonna loomuliku seisundi kohta on arvukad, on need lõppkokkuvõttes seotud moraalsete eelduste puudumisega. Hobbes näeb loomulikku seisundit piiramatu vabadusena, kus inimesed, kellel on võrdsed võimed ja kes ei ole seotud ühegi moraalse mõistega, nagu õiglus, võistlevad lakkamatult ressursside pärast. Locke aga tõlgendab võrdsust ja vabadust pigem eetiliselt kui praktiliselt ja arvab, et sõda on looduse seisundi moonutamine, kuna loodusseadus kohustab inimesi üksteist mitte kahjustama. See erimeelsus mõjutab filosoofide lähenemist valitsusele. Hobbes nõuab kõikvõimsat valitsejat, sest eetiliste piirangute puudumisel ei saa ükski teine asutus sundida inimesi üksteisele haiget tegema. Kuid Locke'i arvates oleks piiramatu võimu andmine valitsusele vastuolus loodusseaduses sisalduvate eetiliste piirangutega, mistõttu ta, erinevalt Hobbesist, pooldab võimude eraldamist. |
| Fashion Police: What Game of Thrones threw up<br/><br/>Canadian-French singer Abbas Hasan put blinding effort to outshine all of humanity at Fashion Parade 2014. Nothing wrong with that, except safety is priority and the musician is a health hazard here.<br/><br/>We get he wants to be a star. Sadly, he didn't get the memo where they tell the desperate and the infamous that stardom is a metaphor. You don't have to look like one and literally set our sight ablaze. Also, the All Pakistan Aunty Association has officially lodged a complaint against him. The local market has run dry of fake crystals and sequined monstrosities. They have nothing to wear to their biweekly high teas and they claim he is to blame. Apparently, the outfit is inspired by Game of Thrones. Can he please stick to composing sad songs about his neighbour's dead dog instead of conceptualising outfits? Or maybe it's the trauma of losing the dog, whose death he is clearly not over as he is still wearing its carcass.<br/><br/>The charge sheet Outfit<br/><br/>No one can decide where the outfit begins and where Abbas ends. You stare in fascination, sinking into a deep abyss and wonder why he is wearing leather pants. Whose horse did he kill to steal the saddle draped across his shoulders? Was he in prison right before his red carpet appearance and forgot to take off the chains? How will he survive the synthetic leather and post-sequin rash that is bound to be lethal in such high dosage? Why am I still alive?<br/><br/>Idea<br/><br/>His inspiration was seemingly Game of Thrones, but he eventually ended up looking like he was thrown out of a Viking restaurant. Had he come across any of the characters from the show, he would've been slain in the first five seconds of the first episode.<br/><br/>The mental health or lack thereof: Someone get him to a counsellor ASAP! He seems to be under the assumption that wearing a dead dog means that the only friend he had in his life is still alive. Dear Abbas:<br/><br/>1. Denial is not a river in Egypt<br/><br/>2. Your tortured psyche is not helping your music, so get help<br/><br/>3. Try imaginary friends<br/><br/>Bail out!<br/><br/>All of us at the Fashion Police headquarters are severely traumatised. Abbas is someone we did not enjoy arresting. He is currently in custody and attempting revenge by putting on attires from other fantasy shows. He just glitter glued himself in order to look like Edward Cullen from Twilight. As a public service message and to prevent further nervous breakdowns, we gave him the following examples of men from the red carpet of the same event.<br/><br/>Zohaib Hassan<br/><br/>When in doubt, play it safe. The singer looks like your average uncle at a shaadi. A plain black suit with no accessories, even if it's a tad disproportionate, is workable. Zohaib's look is blended into everything and nothing, and when you don't have a fashion sense or the money to hire a stylist, this is okay. It does not carry the risk of cardiac arrest for fellow attendees at an event. Given Abbas' delicate mental condition, this look is what he should aim for. Always and forever.<br/><br/>Ali Zafar<br/><br/>One day, after decades of therapy, Abbas could aspire to wear attire like Ali Zafar's. The dapper summer look is done to near perfection. Ali came really close to looking like a maître d at a French restaurant with his white summer jacket with black lapels, but the shirt saves it, never mind the satin. His pants would have been ridiculous had they not been folded at the ankles. The shoes are what hipster chic happy endings are made of. | Moepolitsei: milline troonide mäng oksendas<br/><br/>Kanada-prantsuse laulja Abbas Hasan pani pimestava jõupingutuse kogu inimkonna ületamiseks Fashion Parade 2014. Miski ei ole selles valesti, välja arvatud ohutus on prioriteet ja muusik on siin terviseoht.<br/><br/>Me saame, et ta tahab olla staar. Kahjuks ei saanud ta memo, kus nad ütlevad meeleheitel ja kurikuulus, et stardom on metafoor. Sa ei pea välja nägema üks ja sõna otseses mõttes panna meie nägemine põlema. Samuti on kogu Pakistani tädiühendus ametlikult esitanud kaebuse tema vastu. Kohalik turg on kuivanud võltskristallidest ja sequined koletistest. Neil ei ole oma kahenädalaste kõrgete teede jaoks midagi kanda ja nad väidavad, et ta on süüdi. Ilmselt on komplekt inspireeritud troonide mängust. Kas ta võiks palun jääda oma naabri surnud koera kohta kurbade laulude kirjutamiseks, selle asemel, et kontseptualiseerida varustust? Või võib-olla on see koera kaotamise trauma, kelle surm ta selgelt ei ole üle, sest ta kannab ikka veel oma korjust.<br/><br/>Laadimisleht Outfit<br/><br/>Keegi ei saa otsustada, kus komplekt algab ja kus lõpeb Abbas. Sa vaatad lummuses, vajudes sügavasse kuristikku ja ei tea, miks ta kannab nahast pükse. Kelle hobune ta tappis, et varastada sadul, mis on üle tema õlgade? Kas ta oli vanglas vahetult enne punase vaiba ilmumist ja unustas ketid ära võtta? Kuidas ta ellu jääb sünteetilise naha ja post-sequin lööve, mis on nii suure annuse korral surmav? Miks ma ikka veel elus olen?<br/><br/>Idee<br/><br/>Tema inspiratsioon oli ilmselt Troonide mäng, kuid lõpuks nägi ta välja nagu ta visati välja viikingite restoranist. Kui ta oleks kohanud mõnda näituse tegelast, oleks ta esimese episoodi esimese viie sekundi jooksul tapetud.<br/><br/>Vaimne tervis või selle puudumine: keegi saada teda nõustajale ASAP! Tundub, et ta on eeldusel, et surnud koera kandmine tähendab, et ainus sõber, kes tal elus oli, on endiselt elus. Kallis Abbas:<br/><br/>1. Eitamine ei ole jõgi Egiptuses<br/><br/>2. Teie piinatud psüühika ei aita teie muusikat, nii et saage abi<br/><br/>3. Proovige kujuteldavaid sõpru<br/><br/>Põgenege!<br/><br/>Kõik meist moepolitsei peakorteris on tõsiselt traumatiseeritud. Abbas on keegi, keda me ei nautinud vahistamist. Ta on praegu vahi all ja üritab kätte maksta, pannes riideid teistest fantaasia näitustest. Ta lihtsalt sädeles ennast, et näha välja nagu Edward Cullen Twilightist. Avaliku teenistuse sõnumina ja edasiste närvivapustuste vältimiseks andsime talle järgmised näited sama sündmuse punase vaiba meestest.<br/><br/>Zohaib Hassan<br/><br/>Kahtluse korral mängige seda ohutult. Laulja näeb välja nagu teie keskmine onu shaadil. Tavaline must ülikond ilma tarvikuteta, isegi kui see on natuke ebaproportsionaalne, on töötav. Zohaibi välimus on segatud kõike ja mitte midagi, ja kui teil ei ole moetunnetust või raha stilisti palkamiseks, on see okei. See ei kanna südame seiskumise ohtu üritusel osalejatele. Arvestades Abbasi õrna vaimset seisundit, on see pilk see, mida ta peaks püüdlema.<br/><br/>Ali Zafar<br/><br/>Ühel päeval, pärast aastakümneid kestnud teraapiat, võib Abbas soovida kanda riideid nagu Ali Zafar. Ali tuli väga lähedal välja nagu maître d Prantsuse restoranis oma valge suvel jope mustad rinnahoidjad, kuid särk säästab seda, ei hooli satiin. Tema püksid oleks olnud naeruväärne, kui nad ei oleks volditud pahkluud. Kingad on see, mida hipster šikk õnnelik lõpp on valmistatud. |
| Determining soil hydraulic properties with different wetting liquids : A thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the Degree of Master of Science at Lincoln University<br/><br/>Abstract<br/><br/>Soil hydraulic properties such as hydraulic conductivity, water retention and plant water relationships dominate the water movement processes. For example, the infiltration, evaporation and water flow within the soil. As a widespread phenomenon in soil, soil water repellency alters the soil hydraulic functions by resisting the water flow into the soils. Moreover, the hydraulic properties not only depend on the pore system of soil but also are affected by the physicochemical properties of the pore surfaces. Compared to water, ethanol is not affected by the water repellency due to its lower surface tension. The purpose of using ethanol is to eliminate the effect of soil water repellency on hydraulic properties measurements. However, applying pure ethanol into natural soil can degrade the soil organic materials and lead to changes in physical properties. Therefore, the aqueous ethanol solutions can be an alternative option. Nevertheless, the feasibility of using aqueous ethanol for determining soil liquid retention curve remains unknown. This study aims to test the feasibility of the aqueous ethanol solutions (0, 10 %, 20 %, 30 %, 40 %, 50 % and 100 % v/v) for establishing liquid retention curve under a small range of applied pressure in coarse sand samples with different wettability and organic amended natural soil (Templeton silt loam (TSL) with mushroom compost, biochar, dairy effluent, and municipal compost, the application rate was 15 % by weight). The result showed that the desorption of testing aqueous ethanol solutions compared to water was quicker by approximately 1 to 3x based on the liquid content at the same applied pressure and the time for reaching each equilibrium. The outcomes from the sand experiment suggested that when the concentration of aqueous ethanol solution was below 50 %, the losses via evaporation were less than 1% and the relative differences between testing liquid and water was lower than 10 %. However, the evaporation losses were 11.06 % and 24.6 %, and the relative differences were all around 15 % and 30 % in 50 % and 100 % ethanol solution, respectively. In contrast, the organic amendments in Templeton silt loam not only increased the water retention capability but also reduced the evaporation losses. The evaporation losses in TSL soil and TSL with organic amendments soil were with 1 % in solutions with less than 50 % ethanol content. Evaporation losses of 50 % and 100 % ethanol were 2.8 % and 2.9 %, respectively. The relative differences between water and testing liquid were similar to the sand experiment when the testing liquid concentrations were below 50 %. However, the relative differences in 50 % and 100 % ethanol solution were smaller than in the sand sample with around 10 % and 15%, respectively. Additionally, the analysis of relative difference suggested that almost all aqueous ethanol solutions had lower volumetric liquid content at the same supplied pressure compared to water, which was a reflection of the aqueous ethanol solutions desorbed faster than water under equivalent pressure. Therefore, 10 % to 40 % of ethanol solutions could be considered an alternative for determining soil hydraulic properties due to their faster desorption rate and not being affected by soil water repellency. Due to the evaporation and dissolution of organic material, aqueous ethanol solutions above 50% concentration were not suitable for coarse sand or medium-textured soil.... [Show full abstract] | Erinevate niisutusvedelikega pinnase hüdrauliliste omaduste määramine : Lincolni ülikooli magistrikraadi nõuete osalisel täitmisel esitatud doktoritöö<br/><br/>Abstraktne<br/><br/>Mulla hüdraulilised omadused, nagu hüdrauliline juhtivus, veepeetus ja taimevee suhted, domineerivad vee liikumisprotsessides. Näiteks infiltratsioon, aurustumine ja veevool pinnases. Pinnases laialt levinud nähtusena muudab mulla vee tõrjumine mulla hüdraulilisi funktsioone, takistades vee voolu pinnasesse. Veelgi enam, hüdraulilised omadused ei sõltu mitte ainult mulla pooride süsteemist, vaid ka pooride pindade füüsikalis-keemilistest omadustest. Võrreldes veega ei mõjuta etanooli veetõmbejõudu selle madalama pinnapinge tõttu. Etanooli kasutamise eesmärk on kõrvaldada mulla veehülgavuse mõju hüdrauliliste omaduste mõõtmisele. Kuid puhta etanooli kasutamine looduslikus pinnases võib degradeerida mulla orgaanilisi materjale ja põhjustada füüsikaliste omaduste muutusi. Seetõttu võib alternatiivina kasutada etanooli vesilahuseid, kuid veepõhise etanooli kasutamise teostatavus mulla vedelikupeetuse kõvera määramisel on teadmata. Käesoleva uuringu eesmärk on katsetada etanooli vesilahuste (0, 10 %, 20 %, 30 %, 40 %, 50 % ja 100 % v/v) teostatavust vedeliku peetuse kõvera määramiseks väikesel rakendatud rõhuvahemikul jämeda liiva proovides, millel on erinev niisutatavus ja orgaaniline modifitseeritud looduslik muld (Templetoni siltsavi 15 %, kommunaalkompostiga, biosüsi, piimaheitega). Tulemused näitasid, et uuritavate etanooli vesilahuste desorptsioon oli võrreldes veega umbes 1 kuni 3 korda kiirem, lähtudes vedeliku sisaldusest samal rakendatud rõhul ja iga tasakaalu saavutamise ajast. Liivakatse tulemused näitasid, et kui etanooli vesilahuse kontsentratsioon oli alla 50 %, oli aurustumiskadu alla 1 % ning vedeliku ja vee suhtelised erinevused olid alla 10 %. Kuid aurustumiskaod olid 11,06 % ja 24,6 % ning suhtelised erinevused olid vastavalt umbes 15 % ja 30 % 50 % ja 100 % etanoolilahuse puhul. Seevastu Templetoni mudasavi orgaanilised muudatused mitte ainult ei suurendanud vee säilitamise võimet, vaid vähendasid ka aurustumiskadusid. Orgaaniliste modifikatsioonidega mullas ja TSL mullas oli aurustumiskadu 1 % lahustes, mille etanoolisisaldus oli alla 50 %. Aurustumiskadu 50 % ja 100 % etanoolis oli vastavalt 2,8 % ja 2,9 %. Suhtelised erinevused vee ja katsevedeliku vahel olid sarnased liivakatsega, kui katsevedeliku kontsentratsioonid olid alla 50 %. Siiski olid suhtelised erinevused 50 % ja 100 % etanooli lahuses väiksemad kui liivaproovis, vastavalt ligikaudu 10 % ja 15 %. Lisaks sellele näitas suhtelise erinevuse analüüs, et peaaegu kõigil vesilahustel oli sama rõhu juures võrreldes veega väiksem vedeliku sisaldus, mis peegeldas vesilahuste desorbeerumist kiiremini kui vesi võrdväärse rõhu all. Seetõttu võib mulla hüdrauliliste omaduste määramisel kaaluda alternatiivina 10–40 % etanoolilahuste kasutamist, kuna need desorbeeruvad kiiremini ja neid ei mõjuta mulla veetõrjuvus. Orgaanilise materjali aurustumise ja lahustumise tõttu ei sobinud üle 50% kontsentratsiooniga etanooli vesilahused jämeda liiva või keskmise tekstuuriga pinnase jaoks....
