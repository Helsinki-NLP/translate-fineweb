| Concussion: Using Cooling Helmets to Combat Brain Injuries in College Football<br/><br/>Former football player Kevin Jackson uses brain cooling technology in the hopes of reducing the effects of traumatic brain injuries and sports-related concussions.<br/>Jackson was a running back for the University of Illinois from 1990-1994. In addition to suffering a number of injuries to his body during his playing days, Jackson also suffered a number of un-diagnosed concussions. Now a research scientist and injury spotter, Jackson uses his experience as a player to help him understand and combat brain trauma in sports.<br/>This video illustrates the chain of events that occur when a traumatic brain injury happens, explores how concussion symptoms very from person to person, highlights the need to protect oneself from repeated head traumas, and shows how using cooling technologies might aide in recovery from injury.<br/>To learn more about this research, please visit...<br/> | Peapõrutus: jahutuskiivrite kasutamine ajukahjustuste vastu võitlemiseks kolledži jalgpallis<br/><br/>Endine jalgpallur Kevin Jackson kasutab aju jahutustehnoloogiat, et vähendada traumaatiliste ajuvigastuste ja spordiga seotud põrutuste mõju.<br/>Jackson oli tagasi Illinoisi ülikooli 1990-1994. Lisaks kannatavad mitmeid vigastusi oma keha ajal tema mängu päeva, Jackson kannatas ka mitmeid diagnoosimata põrutusi.

| Massage Therapy<br/><br/>Massage is perhaps one of the oldest healing traditions. Many ancient peoples – including the Ancient Greeks, Egyptians, Chinese and Indians – were convinced of the therapeutic properties of massage and used it to treat a variety of ailments.<br/><br/>Massage therapy is the practice of kneading or manipulating a person's muscles and other soft-tissue in order to improve their wellbeing or health. It is a form of manual therapy that includes holding, moving, and applying pressure to the muscles, tendons, ligaments and fascia.<br/><br/>The term 'massage therapy' is used to describe a wide variety of techniques that vary in the manner in which touch, pressure and the intensity of the treatment is applied.<br/><br/>Massage for treatment of some disorders<br/><br/>Research indicates that massage and myotherapy are effective in managing:<br/><br/>subacute/chronic low back pain<br/><br/>delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS)<br/><br/>anxiety<br/><br/>stress<br/><br/>soft tissue injuries<br/><br/>high blood pressure<br/><br/>insomnia.<br/><br/>They can also be effectively used to support people with:<br/><br/>a chronic disease<br/><br/>a life threatening illness such as cancer.<br/><br/>Benefits of massage<br/><br/>One of the immediate benefits of massage is a feeling of deep relaxation and calm. This occurs because massage prompts the release of endorphins – the brain chemicals (neurotransmitters) that produce feelings of wellbeing.<br/><br/>Levels of stress hormones, such as adrenalin, cortisol and norepinephrine, are also reduced. Studies indicate that high levels of stress hormones impair the immune system.<br/><br/>Some of the physical benefits of massage and myotherapy include:<br/><br/>reduced muscle tension<br/><br/>improved circulation<br/><br/>stimulation of the lymphatic system<br/><br/>reduction of stress hormones<br/><br/>relaxation<br/><br/>increased joint mobility and flexibility<br/><br/>improved skin tone<br/><br/>improved recovery of soft tissue injuries<br/><br/>heightened mental alertness<br/><br/>reduced anxiety and depression | Massaažiteraapia<br/><br/>Massaaž on võib-olla üks vanimaid tervendamistraditsioone. Paljud iidsed rahvad - sealhulgas iidsed kreeklased, egiptlased, hiinlased ja indiaanlased - olid veendunud massaaži terapeutilistes omadustes ja kasutasid seda mitmesuguste tervisehäirete raviks.<br/><br/>Massaaž on inimese lihaste ja muude pehmete kudede sõtkumine või manipuleerimine, et parandada nende heaolu või tervist. See on manuaalse teraapia vorm, mis hõlmab lihaste, kõõluste, sidemete ja fastsia hoidmist, liikumist ja survet.<br/><br/>Mõistet "massaažiteraapia" kasutatakse mitmesuguste tehnikate kirjeldamiseks, mis erinevad viisist, kuidas puudutatakse, survet ja ravi intensiivsust.<br/><br/>Massaaž mõnede häirete raviks<br/><br/>Uuringud näitavad, et massaaž ja müoteraapia on tõhusad:<br/><br/>alaäge/krooniline alaseljavalu<br/><br/>hilinenud lihasvalu (DOMS)<br/><br/>ärevus<br/><br/>stress<br/><br/>pehmete kudede vigastused<br/><br/>Kõrge vererõhk<br/><br/>unetus.<br/><br/>Neid saab tõhusalt kasutada ka inimeste toetamiseks:<br/><br/>krooniline haigus<br/><br/>Eluohtlikud haigused nagu vähk.<br/><br/>Massaaži eelised<br/><br/>Massaaži üks vahetuid eeliseid on sügava lõõgastuse ja rahu tunne. See juhtub seetõttu, et massaaž kutsub esile endorfiinide - aju kemikaalide (neurotransmitterite) vabanemise, mis toodavad heaolu tundeid.<br/><br/>Samuti on vähenenud stressihormoonide, näiteks adrenaliini, kortisooli ja noradrenaliini tase. Uuringud näitavad, et kõrge stressihormoonide tase kahjustab immuunsüsteemi.<br/><br/>Mõned massaaži ja müoteraapia füüsilised eelised on järgmised:<br/><br/>vähenenud lihaspinge<br/><br/>Liikluse parandamine<br/><br/>lümfisüsteemi stimuleerimine<br/><br/>Stresshormoonide vähendamine<br/><br/>lõdvestamine<br/><br/>suurenenud ühine liikuvus ja paindlikkus<br/><br/>Naha toonuse parandamine<br/><br/>Pehmete kudede vigastuste paranemine<br/><br/>suurenenud vaimne erksus<br/><br/>ärevuse ja depressiooni vähenemine |

| Mistakes happen and it can be a long road to recovery when it comes to rebuilding credit.<br/><br/>The Shopping Cart trick is useful for people who have:<br/><br/>1. Declared bankruptcy in the past and is trying to recover 2. Defaulted on payments in the past 3. A lot of credit inquiries and doesn't want to add more inquiries 4. Made late payments in the past and had their accounts closed because of this 5. Someone who doesn't have a credit score at all<br/><br/>The caveat is If they ask you to enter your whole social security number, and not just the last 4, then it will most likely be a hard inquiry. With anything mentioned in this post, your mileage may vary, so it may work for some people and not for others.<br/><br/>If you use this method and have defaulted on payments in the past, be sure to pay off your bills every month.<br/><br/>The Shopping Cart Trick<br/><br/>The Shopping Cart Trick is visiting a website and waiting for a credit card offer to pop up when you check out. You do not need to purchase anything, it will appear before the payment page. This method only works for certain stores.<br/><br/>A few examples are Express, Overstock.com, and Williams-Sonoma. There are a few Synchrony cards like Walmart and QVC that work as well. Full list of stores can be found at the end of this post.<br/><br/>When you go through the process, be sure to have the ad blocker turned off and enter your real address. If the store can't match the last 4 digits of your SSN with your address, then the soft pull won't work. Again, you might have to go through the shopping process a few times before you receive an offer. You don't have to buy anything.<br/><br/>The credit limits might be lower for some people, but the idea is to rebuild your credit. If you do choose to go through this process, I recommend picking stores you will actually shop. It doesn't make sense to get a bonus or points at a store you don't shop at. Most, if not all of the cards, don't have annual fees, so they are good as foundation cards.<br/><br/>For me, this trick doesn't work out well because I don't frequent the listed shops often | Vigu juhtub ja see võib olla pikk tee taastumiseks, kui tegemist on taastamine krediidi.<br/><br/>Ostukorvi trikk on kasulik inimestele, kellel on:<br/><br/>1. Väljakuulutatud pankroti minevikus ja püüab taastada 2. Maksete ebaõnnestumine minevikus 3. Palju krediidi päringuid ja ei taha lisada rohkem päringuid 4. Hilinenud maksed minevikus ja oli oma kontod suletud, sest see 5. Keegi, kellel ei ole krediidiskoori üldse<br/><br/>Hoiatus on Kui nad paluvad teil sisestada kogu oma sotsiaalkindlustuse number, mitte ainult viimane 4, siis on see tõenäoliselt raske uurimine. Midagi selles postituses mainitud, võib teie läbisõit varieeruda, nii et see võib töötada mõnede inimeste ja mitte teiste jaoks.<br/><br/>Kui kasutate seda meetodit ja olete varem makseid teinud, tasuge kindlasti arved iga kuu.<br/><br/>Ostukorvi trikk<br/><br/>Ostukorvi trikk külastab veebisaiti ja ootab väljaregistreerimisel krediitkaardipakkumist. Te ei pea midagi ostma, see ilmub makselehe ette. See meetod töötab ainult teatud kauplustes.<br/><br/>Mõned näited on Express, Overstock.com, ja Williams-Sonoma. Seal on mõned sünkroonsed kaardid nagu Walmart ja QVC, mis töötavad ka. Täieliku nimekirja kauplustest leiate selle postituse lõpus.<br/><br/>Protsessi läbides veenduge, et reklaami blokeerija on välja lülitatud ja sisestage oma tegelik aadress. Kui pood ei sobi teie SSN-i viimased 4 numbrit teie aadressiga, siis pehme tõmbamine ei tööta. Jällegi võib juhtuda, et peate ostuprotsessi läbima paar korda, enne kui saate pakkumise. Sa ei pea midagi ostma.<br/><br/>Krediidilimiidid võivad olla mõnede inimeste jaoks madalamad, kuid idee on teie krediidi ümberehitamine. Kui otsustate selle protsessi läbida, soovitan valida kauplusi, mida tegelikult ostate. Ei ole mõtet saada boonust või punkte kaupluses, kus te ei osta. Enamikul, kui mitte kõigil kaartidel, ei ole aastatasusid, nii et need on head vundamendikaardid.<br/><br/>Minu jaoks ei tööta see trikk hästi, sest ma ei käi sageli loetletud kauplustes |
| Composition in Design – 15 Things You Can't Afford NOT to Know<br/><br/>Composition is one of the six crucial elements of design. Without strong and solid design composition, everything starts falling apart.<br/><br/>In this article we will give you 15 tips on how to strengthen your composition – no matter if it's a photography, illustration or any graphic design project.<br/><br/>We also prepared a beautiful collection of designs in the end, for your inspirarion. Enjoy!<br/><br/>1 . Direct the eye with leading lines<br/><br/>Usually, when you look at any visual, your eye falls first on particular object. In this case, this is the car and it is the focal point of the poster. We will talk a little bit more in our second point of the article. But if your eyes are immidiatelt attracted to certain part of visual, where do you look next? That is a tough question to start with, but a simple answer would be – you look where your eyes lead you. And your eyes lead you, where the designer uses leading lines to direct you through the layout. In this case, a leading line is the road. It also nicely frames the text on the left side and leads your eye back to the focal point of the poster.<br/><br/>Often lines can be more obvious then here, directly using arrows, flowcharts and are very useful method for explaining information and sequences.<br/><br/>2. Create focus in your design composition<br/><br/>A key element to design composition is having a strong focal point. No matter how many elements you have in your design, you have to stress and show the viewer, which is the most important part of your piece. In this case, the artist used color, contrast and scale to organize the space and create focal point. Keep in mind that the most important role of design is to communicate. Therefore, your focal point would be also your most important statement and message to your audience!<br/><br/>3. Use hierachy<br/><br/>Once that you've created your focal point, you have to figure out what to do with the rest of the elements of your design composition. Of course, you have structure these elements as well, and set a priority to them. In this example, the focal point is the man in the picture. Then, we have to look for a name of the event, what is the whole thing about. Only after that, we can keep looking for additional info, such as subheadings, dates, numbers, etc.<br/><br/>All this organization of the information with the help of size, color, weight is called hierachy.<br/><br/>4. Use complementing elements<br/><br/>Always seek to create unifed look throughout your entire design. It is not a good idea to mix and match images from different sources, with no simillarities in style between them. This will only tire the eyes of the viewer and confuse him/her.<br/><br/>This website design is a great example of cohesiveness between the images – they all have simple, one color background and the object are placed in the center. Of course, your design solution would depend on the specific project need.<br/><br/>In this case, you want the viewer to recognize and focus easily on the item to be bought, without any other distraction. The overal feel of the top image and color scheme is also repeated in the backgrounds of the products, so this is one more nice connection between the different parts of the design!<br/><br/>5. Repeat elements<br/><br/>Often your projects will consist of more than one page. If you repeat specific elements from one section of your design to another, you will help the viewer to orientate himself/ herself easier across the design.<br/><br/>Repeating elements are often used to create a certain theme as well and again, help the designcomposition to "stick together".<br/><br/>Some of the repeating elements you could use are: graphic motifs, type, cetrain layout reused in the different pages/parts of your project.<br/><br/>6. Balance elements<br/><br/>There are two types of balance in design composition – symmetrical and asymmetrical. The first uses similar elements, mirrored (distributed equally) on the both sides of an axis (visible or non-visible line). Symmetrical balance is very clean and elegant, but sometimes it can get a bit boring, so then, designers prefer asymmetrical balance instead. Obviously, in this scenario we won't have equal in size elements, placed in similar way.<br/><br/>Here, we look at the different sizes of the elements, the textures and so on. It helps to think of a design elements, as they have "weight". Larger elements would be "heavier". For example, if you have a big, "heavy", vertically pointing pumpkin, you can "balance" it out by using several horizontal lines and smaller objects on the opposite side of the "heavy" object.<br/><br/>7. Align elements<br/><br/>Alignment is another important tool to use in design composition and organize your elements. It often comes handy wen you have a lot of types, colors, images, headings and subheadings. There are many tools on the web, which can help you to snap and align elements to each other, leaving no room for floating pieces and messy design. Alignment brings an elegant vibe to a design. Even the most asymetric designs have some sorts of alignment and structuring of similar blocks of content.<br/><br/>It is a general rule, that when you have a long blocks of texts, left alignment would help the eye to scan more easily teh content. This poster is great visualization of this concept.<br/><br/>8. Use contrast<br/><br/>Contrast is used for drawing attention. If you boost the contrast of an element, this will make it pop. On the contrary, using elements with lower contrast will make them fade and "disappear".<br/><br/>Here, the contrast underlines the strong, geometic, bold architectural forms and the play of light and shadow. Not on last place, the small figure might be with lower contrast, compared to other elements, but it is still visible and nicely balances out the big, dark shape at the opposite, top left corner.<br/><br/>9. Use white space<br/><br/>White space is unreplacable tool in bringing clarity into your design composition. White space is not an "empty space", but necessary element, allowing your design to breathe. It also helps emphasizing the subject of interest.<br/><br/>For example, in this photo, all the white space (unoccupied by other elements) helps to focus all the attention on the woman figure and her posture. Do you think you would pay attention to this woman, if the image was filled in with many other elements? To help you understand the importance of white space, thinks of your own room. How would you feel if you have only one small passage from the door to the bed and everything is piled up with objects? How would you feel, if your bed doesn't not fill the whole room and there are no objects all around the place. Yes, you get the ideas – we all need space, even the design does.<br/><br/>10. Understand and use type of layouts<br/><br/>The first one we are going to look at is the so called, big photo or single visual layout which was was very popular for web designers in the recent years. It gives elegant, clean look, usually highlights a product or service with the help of single high-quality, engaging photo. This type of layout gives a sense of space. As you can suggest, it is not commonly used for news sites, where there is a lot of information to be presented. Here key phrase is quality over quantity.<br/><br/>Key elements to this type of layout are white space and simple typo.<br/><br/>Another type of layout is the Z layout. This is where the eye of the viewer is lead from one element of the design to other.<br/><br/>In this example we naturally first look at the photo, than our eyes are drawn to the text on the right side of the visual and then we continue scanning down, jumping from visual to text. Z layouts create rhythm and are often used on website with lot of information, where you have to orientate the user and "guide" him.<br/><br/>Another way to keep things nice, neat and organized is to use the so called golden ratio or rule of thirds. You can read more about in our article for taking amazing photos, where the same principle applies to photography. In short, dividing your layout into thirds – both vertically and horizontally and placing most important elements where these lines cross, will make your design more visually pleasing.<br/><br/>The example here is MailChimp's website. Notice how the monkey character is slightly to the left? It simply looks good! Oh, and one more thing – when you move a character across space, move it from left to right.<br/><br/>11. Create movement<br/><br/>Movement is change of place or position, an effort. It can be actual motion or it can be implied — arranging parts of the image so that the viewer gets a sense of motion by using lines, shapes, forms, textures, etc.<br/><br/>Since ancient times our eyes are more attracted to moving objects than still ones, and this was important for one's survival – in hunting and protecting yourself from animals. That is why, people are very attracted to images that depict movement and respectively, a composition with nice "flow" of elements is more intriguing.<br/><br/>12. People like triangles<br/><br/>The shape of triangle creates interest, sets a direction and creates movement. Surely, it is a very strong shape and designers and artists use it to organize their layout as well, and not only as visual element. In the recent years, it became hugely popular with the polygon design.<br/><br/>13. Simplification<br/><br/>Simplification is the technique of reducing a composition to only the most essential elements that support the visual statement.<br/><br/>If every part is equally important, then every part is equally unimportant. Nathan Fowkes<br/><br/>It is natural for the eyes to look at details, but it is very hard to see the design as whole and how all elements work together. When in doubt, better remove elements from your design composition, rather adding and trying to find a place for them. We know it's a cliche – but it is still legit "Less is more"!<br/><br/>14. See where your elements are in relation to edges<br/><br/>Often, you will see designers using blank space around the edges of the layout, giving the design room to breathe. Again it is natural to the eye to see elements receeding around edges and fading out. If it is busy around the edges in your design – the overal feel would be of something heavy, big and it will take away from the attention of central elements.<br/><br/>In this case, the designer used large, abstract shape to underline the typo – yeard and names. Because the shape is directing the eye, varied in thickness and has sense of movement to it, it doesn't overwhelm the viewer, but on the contrary – offers him/her aesthetic pleasure and simplicity.<br/><br/>15. Mind the transitions<br/><br/>Transition in design composition is a little bit harder to define. We discussed repetition already, in comparison, transition handles the natural flow from one shape to another, leading the eye from one spot to another. Often, designers use curved lines and shapes to smoothen transition from more angular shapes and blocks of content. Transition helps to relax the eye and "soften" the design.<br/><br/>Looking for some inspiration?<br/><br/>Now that you learnt something about the most important ingredients of good design composition, we made a small gallery with design compositions we find inspiring. Enjoy | Kompositsioon disainis - 15 asja, mida te ei saa lubada, et te ei tea<br/><br/>Kompositsioon on üks disaini kuuest olulisest elemendist. Ilma tugeva ja tahke disainikompositsioonita hakkab kõik lagunema.<br/><br/>Selles artiklis anname teile 15 näpunäidet, kuidas tugevdada oma kompositsiooni - olenemata sellest, kas see on fotograafia, illustratsioon või mis tahes graafiline projekt.<br/><br/>Lõppkokkuvõttes valmistasime teie inspiratsiooniks kauni disainikollektsiooni. Naudi!<br/><br/>1 . Otse silma juhtivate joontega<br/><br/>Tavaliselt, kui vaatate mis tahes visuaalset, langeb teie silm kõigepealt konkreetsele objektile. Sellisel juhul on see auto ja see on plakati fookuspunkt. Räägime natuke rohkem meie artikli teises punktis. Aga kui teie silmad on immidiatelt huvitatud teatud osa visuaalne, kuhu sa vaatad järgmisena? See on raske küsimus alustada, kuid lihtne vastus oleks – sa vaatad, kus silmad sind viivad. Ja teie silmad viivad teid, kus disainer kasutab juhtjooni, et suunata teid paigutuse kaudu. Sel juhul on juhtjoon tee. See raamib ka teksti vasakul küljel ja viib teie silma tagasi plakati fookuspunkti.<br/><br/>Sageli jooned võivad olla ilmsem kui siin, otse kasutades nooli, vooskeeme ja on väga kasulik meetod selgitamiseks teavet ja jadasid.<br/><br/>2. Looge oma disainikompositsioonis fookus<br/><br/>Disaini kompositsiooni võtmeelement on tugev fookuspunkt. Ükskõik kui palju elemente teie disainis on, peate rõhutama ja näitama vaatajale, mis on teie töö kõige olulisem osa. Sel juhul kasutas kunstnik ruumi korraldamiseks ja fookuspunkti loomiseks värvi, kontrasti ja skaalat. Pidage meeles, et disaini kõige olulisem roll on suhelda. Seetõttu oleks teie fookuspunkt ka teie kõige olulisem avaldus ja sõnum teie publikule!<br/><br/>3. Kasuta hierarhiat<br/><br/>Kui olete oma fookuspunkti loonud, peate välja mõtlema, mida teha oma disaini kompositsiooni ülejäänud elementidega. Loomulikult on teil ka need elemendid üles ehitatud ja need prioriteediks seada. Selles näites on fookuspunkt pildil olev mees. Siis peame otsima sündmuse nime, millest kogu asi on. Alles pärast seda saame jätkata täiendava teabe otsimist, nagu alamrubriigid, kuupäevad, numbrid jne.<br/><br/>Kogu seda teabe korraldamist suuruse, värvi, kaalu abil nimetatakse hierarhiaks.<br/><br/>4. Kasutage täiendavaid elemente<br/><br/>Alati püüa luua ühtne välimus kogu oma disaini. See ei ole hea mõte segada ja sobitada pilte erinevatest allikatest, ilma sarnasusi stiilis nende vahel. See ainult väsitab vaataja silmad ja segadusse teda / teda.<br/><br/>See veebilehe kujundus on suurepärane näide piltide sidususest - neil kõigil on lihtne, üks värviline taust ja objekt asetatakse keskele. Loomulikult sõltuks teie disainilahendus konkreetsest projekti vajadusest.<br/><br/>Sellisel juhul soovite, et vaataja tunneks hõlpsasti ära ja keskenduks ostetavale esemele, ilma et see häiriks teisi. Ülemise pildi ja värviskeemi üldine tunne kordub ka toodete taustal, nii et see on veel üks kena seos disaini erinevate osade vahel!<br/><br/>5. Korda elemente<br/><br/>Sageli koosneb teie projektid rohkem kui ühest lehest. Kui te kordate oma kujunduse ühest osast teise teatud elemente, aitab see vaatajal kujundusel paremini orienteeruda.<br/><br/>Korduvaid elemente kasutatakse sageli teatud teema loomiseks ja jälle aitavad disainikompositsioonil "kleepuda".<br/><br/>Mõned korduvad elemendid, mida saate kasutada, on: graafilised motiivid, tüüp, cetraini paigutus, mida kasutatakse teie projekti erinevates lehtedes / osades.<br/><br/>6. Tasakaalu elemendid<br/><br/>Disainikompositsioonis on kahte tüüpi tasakaalu - sümmeetriline ja asümmeetriline. Esimene kasutab sarnaseid elemente, mis on peegeldunud (jaotatud võrdselt) telje mõlemal küljel (nähtav või nähtamatu joon). Sümmeetriline tasakaal on väga puhas ja elegantne, kuid mõnikord võib see muutuda natuke igavaks, nii et siis eelistavad disainerid asümmeetrilist tasakaalu. Ilmselgelt ei ole meil selles stsenaariumis võrdse suurusega elemente, mis on paigutatud sarnaselt.<br/><br/>Siin vaatame elementide erinevaid suurusi, tekstuure ja nii edasi. See aitab mõelda disainielementidele, kuna neil on "kaal". Suuremad elemendid oleksid "raskemad". Näiteks kui teil on suur, "raske", vertikaalselt suunatud kõrvits, saate seda "tasakaalustada", kasutades mitut horisontaalset joont ja väiksemaid objekte "raske" objekti vastasküljel.<br/><br/>7. Joondage elemendid<br/><br/>Joondamine on veel üks oluline tööriist, mida saab kasutada disaini kompositsioonis ja korraldada oma elemente. See on sageli mugav, kui teil on palju tüüpe, värve, pilte, päiseid ja alamrubriike. Veebis on palju tööriistu, mis aitavad teil elemente üksteisega klammerdada ja joondada, jättes ruumi ujuvatele tükkidele ja räpasele disainile. Joondamine toob disainile elegantse vibe. Isegi kõige asümmeetrilisematel kujundustel on teatud tüüpi joondumine ja sarnaste sisuplokkide struktureerimine.<br/><br/>Üldine reegel on, et kui sul on pikk tekstiplokk, aitab vasakjoondus silmal hõlpsamini skaneerida teh sisu. See plakat on selle kontseptsiooni suurepärane visualiseerimine.<br/><br/>8. Kasutage kontrasti<br/><br/>Kontrasti kasutatakse tähelepanu tõmbamiseks. Kui suurendate elemendi kontrasti, muudab see selle popiks. Vastupidi, madalama kontrastiga elementide kasutamine muudab need tuhmuma ja "kaduma".<br/><br/>Siin rõhutab kontrast tugevaid, geomeetilisi, julgeid arhitektuurilisi vorme ning valguse ja varju mängu. Mitte viimasel kohal, väike näitaja võib olla madalama kontrastiga, võrreldes teiste elementidega, kuid see on siiski nähtav ja tasakaalustab kenasti suurt tumedat kuju vastupidises, ülemises vasakus nurgas.<br/><br/>9. Kasutage valget ruumi<br/><br/>Valge ruum on asendamatu vahend, mis toob selguse teie disaini kompositsiooni. Valge ruum ei ole "tühi ruum", vaid vajalik element, mis võimaldab teie disainil hingata. Samuti aitab see rõhutada huvipakkuvat teemat.<br/><br/>Näiteks selles fotos aitab kogu valge ruum (mitte teiste elementide poolt hõivatud) keskenduda kogu tähelepanu naise figuurile ja tema asendile. Kas sa arvad, et sa pööraksid sellele naisele tähelepanu, kui pilt oleks täidetud paljude teiste elementidega? Et aidata teil mõista valge ruumi tähtsust, mõtle oma ruumi. Kuidas sa tunneksid, kui teil on ainult üks väike läbipääs uksest voodisse ja kõik on esemetega kuhjatud? Kuidas tunneksite, kui teie voodi ei täida kogu ruumi ja kogu koht ei ole esemeid. Jah, te saate ideed - me kõik vajame ruumi, isegi disain teeb.<br/><br/>10. Mõista ja kasutada tüüpi paigutused<br/><br/>Esimene, mida me vaatame, on nn suur foto või üks visuaalne paigutus, mis oli viimastel aastatel veebidisainerite jaoks väga populaarne. See annab elegantse, puhta välimuse, tavaliselt tõstab esile toote või teenuse ühe kvaliteetse, kaasahaarava foto abil. Seda tüüpi paigutus annab ruumi. Nagu võite soovitada, ei kasutata seda tavaliselt uudiste saitide jaoks, kus on palju teavet. Siin on võtmefraas kvaliteet üle kvantiteedi.<br/><br/>Seda tüüpi paigutuse põhielemendid on tühik ja lihtne trükkimine.<br/><br/>Teine paigutuse tüüp on Z- paigutus. See on koht, kus vaataja silm viib kujunduse ühelt elemendilt teisele.<br/><br/>Selles näites vaatame kõigepealt loomulikult fotot, kui meie silmad on tõmmatud visuaalse parema külje tekstile ja seejärel jätkame skannimist, hüppame visuaalsest tekstist. Z paigutused luua rütmi ja kasutatakse sageli veebilehel palju teavet, kus sa pead orienteerida kasutaja ja "juhend" teda.<br/><br/>Teine võimalus hoida asjad kenad, puhtad ja organiseeritud on kasutada nn kuldset suhet või kolmanda reeglit. Lisateavet saate lugeda meie artiklist hämmastavate fotode tegemiseks, kus sama põhimõte kehtib fotograafia kohta. Lühidalt, oma paigutuse jagamine kolmandateks - nii vertikaalselt kui ka horisontaalselt ning kõige olulisemate elementide paigutamine, kus need jooned ristuvad, muudab teie disaini visuaalselt meeldivamaks.<br/><br/>Näide siin on MailChimpi veebisait. Pange tähele, kuidas ahvimärk on veidi vasakule? See lihtsalt näeb hea välja! Oh, ja veel üks asi - kui liigutate märki ruumis, liigutage seda vasakult paremale.<br/><br/>11. Loo liikumine<br/><br/>Liikumine on koha või asendi muutmine, jõupingutus. See võib olla tegelik liikumine või see võib olla kaudselt - pildi osade korraldamine nii, et vaataja saab liikumise tunde, kasutades jooni, kujundeid, kujundeid, tekstuure jne.<br/><br/>Juba iidsetest aegadest on meie silmad liikuvate objektide vastu rohkem huvi tundnud kui ikka veel, ja see oli inimese ellujäämise jaoks oluline – jahipidamisel ja loomade eest kaitsmisel. Sellepärast on inimesed väga huvitatud piltidest, mis kujutavad liikumist ja vastavalt kompositsioon, millel on kena elementide "voog", on intrigeerivam.<br/><br/>12. Inimesed nagu kolmnurgad<br/><br/>Kolmnurga kuju tekitab huvi, määrab suuna ja loob liikumise. Kindlasti on see väga tugev kuju ja disainerid ja kunstnikud kasutavad seda ka oma paigutuse korraldamiseks, mitte ainult visuaalse elemendina. Viimastel aastatel on see polügoonide disainiga muutunud väga populaarseks.<br/><br/>13. Lihtsustamine<br/><br/>Lihtsustamine on meetod kompositsiooni vähendamiseks ainult kõige olulisematele elementidele, mis toetavad visuaalset avaldust.<br/><br/>Kui kõik osad on võrdselt tähtsad, siis kõik osad on võrdselt tähtsusetud. - Nathan Fowkes<br/><br/>On loomulik, et silmad vaatavad üksikasju, kuid on väga raske näha disaini tervikuna ja seda, kuidas kõik elemendid koos töötavad. Kahtluse korral on parem eemaldada elemendid oma disainikompositsioonist, pigem lisada ja püüda leida neile koht. Me teame, et see on klišee - kuid see on ikka legit "vähem on rohkem"!<br/><br/>14. Vaadake, kus teie elemendid on servade suhtes<br/><br/>Sageli näete disainereid, kes kasutavad paigutuse servade ümber tühja ruumi, andes disainiruumi hingata. Jällegi on silmale loomulik näha servade ümber asuvaid ja tuhmunud elemente. Kui see on hõivatud servade ümber teie disainis - üldine tunne oleks midagi rasket, suurt ja see võtab ära keskelementide tähelepanu.<br/><br/>Sellisel juhul kasutas disainer suurt, abstraktset kujundit, et rõhutada kirjaviga – aastakäik ja nimed. Kuna kuju suunab silma, on selle paksus varieeruv ja sellel on liikumise tunne, ei ületa see vaatajat, vaid vastupidi - pakub talle esteetilist naudingut ja lihtsust.<br/><br/>15. Pidage meeles üleminekuid<br/><br/>Üleminek disainikompositsioonis on natuke raskem määratleda. Me arutasime kordamist juba, võrreldes üleminekuga käsitleb loomulikku voolu ühest kujust teise, juhtides silma ühest kohast teise. Sageli kasutavad disainerid kõveraid jooni ja kujundeid, et sujuvalt üle minna rohkem nurkadest kujunditest ja sisuplokkidest. Üleminek aitab silma lõõgastuda ja disaini "pehmendada".<br/><br/>Otsid inspiratsiooni?<br/><br/>Nüüd, kui olete õppinud midagi hea disainikompositsiooni kõige olulisemate koostisosade kohta, tegime väikese galerii disainikompositsioonidega, mis on inspireerivad. |

| Memory CD8+ T cells are essential cells of the immune system, retained post infection to protect from subsequent immunological insults. Many transcriptional regulators and some proximal signaling cascades associated with both naive and memory T cells have been described and have greatly informed the process by which immunological memory is formed. Despite clear differences in transcription factor expression and cytokine requirements, how global signal transduction induced by antigen binding differs between naive and memory CD8+ T cells is completely unknown and thus represents a significant gap in our knowledge base. One key signaling event that occurs in response to TCR stimulation is the activation of kinases that phosphorylate tyrosine residues on downstream signaling proteins. Therefore, comparing the phosphotyrosine signaling networks between naive and memory T cells will identify targets for modulation of the CD8+ T cell immune response to positively influence response to disease and vaccine efficacy. The objective of this specific proposal is to determine the intracellular signaling pathways that are unique to restimulated memory CD8+ T cells. Our central hypothesis is that distinct signal transduction pathways regulate the memory CD8+ T cell response. The rationale and scientific premise for the proposed work is that understanding at a global proteomic level the changes that occur in T cells as they differentiate from naive to memory T cells will enable more efficacious vaccine and drug treatment design to combat disease and infection. We will test our central hypothesis with the following specific aims: 1) Determine the TCR signal transduction changes that occur in CD8+ nave and memory T cells. To profile kinase signaling networks, we will utilize a highly sensitive quantitative mass spectrometric assay we developed on naive, effector and memory CD8+ T cells. Based on a preliminary screen, we identified that Jak2 is hyperphosphorylated, indicating it is a key mediator of the recall response. We will test the hypothesis that Jak2 hyperactivation is critical for memory recall responses. Together, the completion of Aim1 will identify novel signaling networks that contribute to CD8+ memory recall responses and 2) Defining phosphorylation of CREB binding protein (CBP) as a molecular switch that regulates transcriptional networks in memory CD8+ T cells. Given our preliminary data in which we uncovered unique signaling pathways associated with CD8+ memory T cell formation, we hypothesize that in memory CD8+ T cells, increased Jak2 activation drives phosphorylation of CBP to promote a unique transcriptional landscape versus a nave T cell. We will identify how phosphorylation of CBP regulates binding of transcription factors such as CREB and MYB. Additionally, we will take a genetic approach to determine how CBP functions in the formation of CD8+ memory cells and CD8+ memory recall responses. Together, data obtained in this Aim2 will establish a novel mechanism that explains how changes in tyrosine kinase activity associated with CD8+ T cell memory formation drive unique transcriptional programs.<br/><br/>Public Health Relevance<br/><br/>The studies proposed herein will determine, using mass spectrometry, the signal transduction events that take place in memory CD8+ T cells upon restimulation, relative to nave CD8+ T cells. Given that these cells play an essential role in protection from secondary infection, it is imperative that we understand the molecular mechanisms by which these cells exert their effector function for the protection of human health. | Mälu CD8+ T-rakud on immuunsüsteemi olulised rakud, mis säilivad pärast infektsiooni, et kaitsta järgnevate immunoloogiliste solvangute eest. Kirjeldatud on paljusid transkriptsiooni regulaatoreid ja mõningaid proksimaalseid signaale, mis on seotud nii naiivsete kui ka mälu T-rakkudega, ning on oluliselt teavitanud immunoloogilise mälu moodustumise protsessi. Vaatamata selgetele erinevustele transkriptsioonifaktori ekspressioonis ja tsütokiinide nõuetes, on see, kuidas globaalne signaali ülekandumine, mida indutseerib antigeeni sidumine, naiivsete ja mälu CD8+ T-rakkude vahel täiesti teadmata ja seega kujutab endast olulist lünka meie teadmistebaasis. Üks oluline signalisatsioonisündmus, mis tekib vastusena TCR stimulatsioonile, on kinaaside aktiveerimine, mis fosforüleerivad türosiini jääke allavoolu signalisatsioonivalkudel. Seega, kui võrrelda fosfotürosiini signaalvõrke naiivsete ja mälu T-rakkude vahel, määratakse kindlaks CD8+ T-rakkude immuunvastuse modulatsiooni eesmärgid, et positiivselt mõjutada vastust haigusele ja vaktsiini efektiivsust. Konkreetse ettepaneku eesmärk on määrata kindlaks rakusisesed signalisatsiooniteed, mis on unikaalsed restimuleeritud mälu CD8+ T-rakkudele. Meie keskne hüpotees on, et erinevad signaali transduktsiooniteed reguleerivad mälu CD8+ T-rakkude vastust. Kavandatava töö põhjenduseks ja teaduslikuks eelduseks on see, et T-rakkudes toimuvate muutuste mõistmine globaalsel proteoomilisel tasandil, kuna nad eristuvad naiivsetest mälu T-rakkudest, võimaldab tõhusamat vaktsiini ja ravimiravi disaini haiguste ja nakkuste vastu võitlemiseks. Me testime oma keskset hüpoteesi järgmiste konkreetsete eesmärkidega: 1) Määrake TCR signaali transduktsiooni muutused, mis esinevad CD8+ nave ja mälu T-rakkudes. Kinaasi signalisatsioonivõrkude profileerimiseks kasutame väga tundlikku kvantitatiivset massispektromeetrilist analüüsi, mille oleme välja töötanud naiivsete, efektori ja mälu CD8+ T-rakkude jaoks. Esialgse ekraani põhjal tuvastasime, et Jak2 on hüperfosforüleeritud, mis näitab, et see on meeldetuletusreaktsiooni peamine vahendaja. Testime hüpoteesi, et Jak2 hüperaktivatsioon on mälu meeldetuletusreaktsioonide jaoks kriitiline. Üheskoos tuvastab Aim1 lõpuleviimine uudsed signalisatsioonivõrgud, mis aitavad kaasa CD8+ mälu meeldetuletusreaktsioonidele ja 2) määratleb CREB siduva valgu (CBP) fosforüülimise molekulaarse lülitina, mis reguleerib transkriptsioonivõrke mälu CD8+ T-rakkudes. Arvestades meie esialgseid andmeid, milles me avastasime unikaalsed signaalimisrajad, mis on seotud CD8+ mälu T-rakkude moodustumisega, eeldame, et mälu CD8+ T-rakkudes suurendab Jak2 aktiveerimine CBP fosforüülimist, et edendada unikaalset transkriptsioonilist maastikku võrreldes nave T-rakkudega. Selgitame, kuidas CBP fosforüülimine reguleerib transkriptsioonifaktorite, nagu CREB ja MYB, sidumist. Lisaks võtame geneetilise lähenemise, et määrata, kuidas CBP toimib CD8+ mälurakkude moodustamisel ja CD8+ mälu meeldetuletusreaktsioonides. Üheskoos loovad selles Aim2-s saadud andmed uudse mehhanismi, mis selgitab, kuidas CD8+ T-rakkude mälu moodustumisega seotud türosiinkinaasi aktiivsuse muutused käivitavad unikaalseid transkriptsiooniprogramme.<br/><br/>Rahvatervise tähtsus<br/><br/>Siin väljapakutud uuringud määravad massispektromeetria abil kindlaks signaaliülekande sündmused, mis toimuvad mälu CD8+ T-rakkudes restimulatsioonil, võrreldes nave CD8+ T-rakkudega. Arvestades, et need rakud mängivad olulist rolli kaitses sekundaarse infektsiooni eest, on hädavajalik, et me mõistaksime molekulaarseid mehhanisme, mille abil need rakud täidavad oma efektori funktsiooni inimeste tervise kaitsmiseks. |
