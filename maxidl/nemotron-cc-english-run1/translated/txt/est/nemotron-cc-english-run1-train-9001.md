| UNDERSTANDING SELF-EXECUTING TREATIES VIA STATE PRACTICE<br/><br/>Updated: Feb 2<br/><br/>Introduction:<br/><br/>Consider this paradox, when a country ratifies a treaty, it is said to have consented to accept the treaty in its entirety (reservations and declarations being exceptions); but in some cases, the countries go ahead and refuse to adhere to its provisions. For example, Article VI, Clause 2 of the American Constitution has the provisions that "all treaties … shall be the supreme Law of the Land." Although it is evident that treaties on their own do not have the same effect as federal laws. In truth, they only become operational once these provisions come into force as Federal law with Senate and Presidential approval. Although this is the practice, it is a generally accepted principle in international law that certain treaties have a binding effect on countries. The treaty must fulfil the requirement of being a self-executing treaty to affect the country without any corresponding domestic legislature directly.<br/><br/>This raises the question as to which treaty will qualify as "self-executing" and which will not?<br/><br/>Whether a treaty is a self-executing treaty or not is decided by national judges on a case-to-case basis (Buergenthal, 1992). In order to understand this, the paper will first look at the two types of theories followed by countries on the nature of treaties applying to domestic law. These two theories are monism and dualism. They basically view the framework of domestic and international law as a single hierarchy and two separate hierarchies, respectively (Wildhaber, 1971). Countries following monism believe that certain treaties immediately are binding and immediately have an effect on the country. Once the treaty has been ratified, it can be invoked in national courts and is considered to be a part of the law of the country. Countries following dualism believe that a treaty does not affect domestic law until it has been reinforced by a legislature passed in the parliament. An example of dualism is how the European Convention on Human Rights became operational in the United Kingdom after passing the Human Rights Act 1998 in their parliament (Laws, 2000).<br/><br/>International law is diverse, and so are the types of procedures different countries follow for the acceptance of treaties. Some constitutions' themselves mention the procedures for the ratification of a treaty. Some countries even have different treatment given to international treaty law and customary international law. Certain international organizations like the European Union often affect the domestic law of its member states. The member states of the European Union have to give effect to certain forms of community legislature. Although, it has an essential difference from self-executing treaties. The difference is that it is not for national judges to decide whether the provisions are self-executing or not, but rather for the European Court of Justice to interpret under its constitutive treaties. Other forms of international law formed via resolutions or such might not have the same effect for these states. Nevertheless, they might consider them as forms of "soft law" and look into them to interpret the intent of the law. Sometimes, proclamations made by the judicial organs of international organizations such as the Inter-American Court of Human Rights affect their member states. Although these proclamations are not binding on the member states, the national judges seem to refer to these for authoritative interpretation.<br/><br/>Therefore, a case-to-case approach must be taken while analyzing the procedures and precedents set in different countries. To examine the concept of self-executing treaties, this paper will compare the precedents set by different jurisdictions. If the reader wishes to conduct a similar analysis, they can do so by looking into the different national yearbooks on international law. Mostly, these yearbooks will have a section devoted to the relationship between international and national law.<br/><br/>International Jurisprudence:<br/><br/>The most significant issue that comes up for national courts is whether the treaty is self-executing? If the treaty can be applied without any additional domestic legislature having passed to reinforce it. This question came up in the case of Czesław S v State Treasury and Minister of the State Treasury, wherein the Polish Constitutional Court held that since the treaty provisions referred to domestic measures to be taken, the treaty was not self-executing in nature (Bug river claims, Czesław S v State Treasury and Minister of the State Treasury, 2003). Essentially, when the treaty refers to domestic measures to be taken, it does not in itself create new obligations. It instead reinforces the treaty's intent for the domestic legal process to take measures for the same. A similar issue was raised in the Sosa case in the United States of America. In this case, the court considered whether the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights was a self-executing treaty. The American Supreme Court has also declared that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is not a self-executing treaty (Court, 2004). The Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland also examined the self-executing nature of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The issue before the court was whether Article 13(2)(b) and (c) were self-executing in nature. The court examined whether the treaty was partially self-executing and did so by checking whether there existed a minimum core content for the treaty to be applicable. The court held that it found no such provision within the treaty (A and B v Government of the Canton of Zurich, 2000).<br/><br/>It is essential to understand that these issues differ from the fundamental question of whether international law can be applied as part of the law of the land? In order to answer this question, the paper will examine the judgement by the Supreme Court of the Dominican Republic. The Supreme Court stated that Article 3 of the Dominican Republic's Constitution made international law binding on the domestic legal order. The court rejected the Superior Land Court's interpretation that these treaties were "foreign legislature" and not part of the domestic legal order. The Supreme Court laid down that all treaties ratified by the Dominican Republic formed a part of Dominican Law and, therefore, can be termed as self-executing (Gallardo Montilla v Gallardo Concepción and ors, 1997). The Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland has examined whether the Libson Treaty was self-executing and directly applicable to Swiss Universities. The court held, "According to relevant case law, a treaty norm is directly applicable if its content is sufficiently precise and clear to form the basis of a decision in a particular case. The norm thus has to be justiciable, i.e. define the rights and obligations of an individual and be directed at the competent authorities" (X v University of Lucerne, 2014). This implies that whether the treaty is directly applicable or not, depends upon on whether the norm is justiciable. The Lisbon Treaty is based on the principle of qualifications acquired aboard. This is conveyed through Article IV (1) of the treaty. The purpose of this was to create an obligation for states to show that their decision-making process is fair, transparent and non-discriminatory. The responsibility for proving that the applicant has not met the required criteria is on the "body undertaking the assessment." The treaty guarantees procedural safeguards, which are generally accepted by countries and hence, the court held this treaty to be self-executing. This goes on to showcase the different interpretations undertaken by the courts of various countries.<br/><br/>It is essential to observe whether the norms set out by treaties are actually being complied with. The case laws from various jurisdictions have emphasized that national courts are the final authority on the issue of whether a treaty is self-executing. There is also an inherent duty cast on countries for the observance and due performance of treaties. Such is cast by the Pacta Sunt Servanda rule as enshrined within Article 26 of the Vienna Convention on Law of Treaties (VCLT). Article 27 goes on to reinforce it by stating that international law obligations cannot be ignored by using domestic law as a justification. Many countries' courts have used this as a source of interpretation, such as the Latvian Constitutional Court. In the case of a national norm conflicting with an international norm, the court held that the national norm was null and void. To reach its conclusion, the court strongly relied on the necessary performance of treaties in good faith as envisaged in Article 26 of the VCLT (Linija v Latvia, 2004).<br/><br/>Conclusion:<br/><br/>From the above, it is clear that treaties have particular requirements before they can be considered self-executing. However, keeping all of these aside, the most important still remains the national courts' interpretation. The national courts decide whether the treaty can be called self-executing or not. Although their Constitution's might contain a provision regarding treaty law being the supreme law of the land, courts from different countries interpret these provisions in different manners. This can be seen as to how the American and Dominican Constitutions' both contain these provisions but follow completely different interpretations of the same. The term "self-executing" may not be congruous for these treaties since, in practice, they still need approval from the national courts. Ideally, the way forward should be that countries acknowledge the self-executing nature of treaties and treat them in a fashion wherein Article 26 and 27 of the VCLT are respected. Again, this is the "ideal" situation and is not likely to find its way into state practice of certain jurisdictions anytime soon. Still, hope can be gained via looking into the interpretations of national courts that respect these norms and hopefully pave the way for other courts to acknowledge this.<br/><br/>References:<br/><br/>Buergenthal, T.

Näiteks Ameerika põhiseaduse VI artikli punktis 2 on sätted, et "kõik lepingud ... on riigi ülim seadus". Kuigi on ilmne, et lepingud üksi ei ole sama mõju kui föderaalseadused. Tegelikult hakkavad nad toimima alles siis, kui need sätted jõustuvad föderaalseadusena senati ja presidendi heakskiidul. Kuigi see on tava, on rahvusvahelises õiguses üldtunnustatud põhimõte, et teatud lepingud on riikidele siduvad. Leping peab vastama nõudele, et see on isetäituv leping, mis mõjutab riiki ilma vastava siseriikliku seadusandjata.<br/><br/>See tõstatab küsimuse, milline leping kvalifitseerub „isetäituvaks” ja milline mitte?<br/><br/>Seda, kas leping on isetäituv või mitte, otsustavad liikmesriikide kohtunikud iga juhtumi puhul eraldi (Buergenthal, 1992). Selleks, et seda mõista, uurib paber kõigepealt kahte tüüpi teooriaid, mida riigid järgivad riigisisese õiguse suhtes kohaldatavate lepingute olemuse kohta. Need kaks teooriat on monism ja dualism. Põhimõtteliselt näevad nad siseriikliku ja rahvusvahelise õiguse raamistikku vastavalt ühe hierarhiana ja kahe eraldi hierarhiana (Wildhaber, 1971). Monismi järgivad riigid usuvad, et teatavad lepingud on kohe siduvad ja mõjutavad riiki. Kui leping on ratifitseeritud, saab seda kasutada riiklikes kohtutes ja seda peetakse riigi õiguse osaks. Dualismi järgivad riigid usuvad, et leping ei mõjuta siseriiklikku õigust enne, kui seda on parlamendis vastu võetud seadusandjaga tugevdatud. Näide dualismist on see, kuidas Euroopa inimõiguste konventsioon Ühendkuningriigis pärast 1998. aasta inimõiguste seaduse vastuvõtmist Ühendkuningriigi parlamendis (2000. aasta seadused) hakkas toimima.<br/><br/>Rahvusvaheline õigus on mitmekesine ja nii on ka menetluste liigid, mida erinevad riigid järgivad lepingute vastuvõtmisel. Mõned põhiseadused ise mainivad lepingu ratifitseerimise menetlusi. Mõnel riigil on isegi erinev kohtlemine rahvusvahelisele lepinguõigusele ja rahvusvahelisele tavaõigusele. Teatud rahvusvahelised organisatsioonid, nagu Euroopa Liit, mõjutavad sageli oma liikmesriikide siseriiklikku õigust. Euroopa Liidu liikmesriigid peavad jõustama teatud ühenduse seadusandja vorme, kuigi see erineb olulisel määral isetäituvate lepingute omast. Erinevus seisneb selles, et liikmesriikide kohtunikud ei saa otsustada, kas need sätted on isetäituvad või mitte, vaid pigem peab Euroopa Kohus tõlgendama neid oma aluslepingute alusel. Muud rahvusvahelise õiguse vormid, mis on moodustatud resolutsioonidega või sellistena, ei pruugi nende riikide jaoks sama mõju olla, kuid nad võivad neid käsitleda kui "pehme õiguse" vorme ja uurida neid seaduse kavatsuse tõlgendamiseks. Mõnikord mõjutavad rahvusvaheliste organisatsioonide, näiteks Ameerika Inimõiguste Kohtu, kohtuorganite väljakuulutamised nende liikmesriike. Kuigi need väljakuulutamised ei ole liikmesriikidele siduvad, näib, et liikmesriikide kohtunikud viitavad neile autoriteetse tõlgendamise eesmärgil.<br/><br/>Seetõttu tuleb eri riikides kehtestatud menetluste ja pretsedentide analüüsimisel võtta juhtumipõhine lähenemisviis. Isetäituvate lepingute mõiste uurimiseks võrreldakse käesolevas dokumendis erinevate jurisdiktsioonide kehtestatud pretsedente. Kui lugeja soovib teha sarnast analüüsi, saab seda teha, uurides erinevaid rahvuslikke aastaraamatuid rahvusvahelise õiguse kohta. Enamasti on nendes aastaraamatutes osa, mis on pühendatud rahvusvahelise ja rahvusliku õiguse vahelistele suhetele.<br/><br/>Rahvusvaheline kohtupraktika:<br/><br/>Kõige olulisem küsimus, mis kerkib liikmesriikide kohtutele, on see, kas leping on isetäituv? Kui lepingut saab kohaldada ilma täiendavate siseriiklike seadusandjateta, kes on selle tugevdamiseks vastu võtnud. See küsimus tõstatati kohtuasjas Czesław S vs. riigikassa ja riigikassa minister, kus Poola konstitutsioonikohus otsustas, et kuna lepingu sätetes viidatakse riigisisestele meetmetele, ei ole leping oma olemuselt isetäituv (Bug Riveri nõuded, Czesław S vs. riigikassa ja riigikassa minister, 2003). Põhimõtteliselt, kui leping viitab riigisisestele meetmetele, ei loo see iseenesest uusi kohustusi, vaid pigem tugevdab lepingu kavatsust riigisiseses õigusprotsessis võtta meetmeid samaks. Sarnane küsimus tõstatati ka Ameerika Ühendriikides Sosa kohtuasjas, kus kohus kaalus, kas kodaniku- ja poliitiliste õiguste rahvusvaheline pakt on isetäituv leping. Ameerika Ühendriikide Ülemkohus on samuti kinnitanud, et kodaniku- ja poliitiliste õiguste rahvusvaheline pakt ei ole isetäituv leping (Court, 2004). Šveitsi föderaalne ülemkohus uuris ka kodaniku- ja poliitiliste õiguste rahvusvahelise pakti isetäituvat olemust. Kohtus oli küsimus, kas artikli 13 lõike 2 punktid b ja c on oma olemuselt isetäituvad. Kohus uuris, kas leping oli osaliselt isetäituv, kontrollides, kas lepingu kohaldamiseks oli olemas minimaalne põhisisu. Kohus leidis, et ta ei leidnud lepingus sellist sätet (A ja B versus Zürichi kantoni valitsus, 2000).<br/><br/>On oluline mõista, et need küsimused erinevad fundamentaalsest küsimusest, kas rahvusvahelist õigust saab kohaldada maaõiguse osana? Sellele küsimusele vastamiseks uuritakse dokumendis Dominikaani Vabariigi ülemkohtu otsust. Riigikohus märkis, et Dominikaani Vabariigi põhiseaduse artikkel 3 muutis rahvusvahelise õiguse siseriiklikule õiguskorrale siduvaks. Kohus lükkas tagasi Ülemkohtu tõlgenduse, et need lepingud on "välisriigi seadusandja", mitte osa siseriiklikust õiguskorrast. Ülemkohus sätestas, et kõik Dominikaani Vabariigi ratifitseeritud lepingud moodustasid osa Dominikaani seadusest ja neid võib seetõttu nimetada enesetäitmiseks (Gallardo Montilla vs. Gallardo Concepción et ors, 1997). Šveitsi föderaalne ülemkohus on uurinud, kas Libsoni leping oli isetäituv ja vahetult kohaldatav Šveitsi ülikoolide suhtes. Kohus otsustas: „Vastavalt asjakohasele kohtupraktikale on lepingunorm vahetult kohaldatav, kui selle sisu on piisavalt täpne ja selge, et moodustada konkreetse juhtumi kohta otsuse tegemise alus. Seega peab norm olema kohtulik, st määratlema üksikisiku õigused ja kohustused ning olema suunatud pädevatele asutustele (X vs. Luzerni Ülikool, 2014). See tähendab, et see, kas leping on vahetult kohaldatav või mitte, sõltub sellest, kas norm on õiguspärane. Lissaboni leping põhineb pardal omandatud kvalifikatsiooni põhimõttel. See on edastatud lepingu artikli IV lõike 1 kaudu. Selle eesmärk oli luua riikidele kohustus näidata, et nende otsustusprotsess on õiglane, läbipaistev ja mittediskrimineeriv. Vastutus selle tõendamise eest, et taotleja ei ole täitnud nõutud kriteeriume, lasub „hindamist teostaval asutusel”. Leping tagab menetluslikud tagatised, mida riigid üldiselt aktsepteerivad, ja seega leidis kohus, et see leping on isetäituv. See näitab erinevate riikide kohtute erinevaid tõlgendusi.<br/><br/>On oluline jälgida, kas lepingutes sätestatud norme tegelikult järgitakse. Erinevate jurisdiktsioonide kohtupraktika on rõhutanud, et siseriiklikud kohtud on lõplikud volitused küsimuses, kas leping on isetäituv. Riikidel on ka omane kohustus lepingute järgimise ja nõuetekohase täitmise eest. Selline on Pacta sunt servanda reegel, mis on sätestatud Viini lepinguõiguse konventsiooni (VCLT) artiklis 26. Artikkel 27 jätkab selle tugevdamist, sätestades, et rahvusvahelise õiguse kohustusi ei saa eirata siseriikliku õiguse alusel. Paljude riikide kohtud, näiteks Läti konstitutsioonikohus, on seda tõlgendamise allikana kasutanud. Rahvusvahelise normiga vastuolus oleva siseriikliku normi puhul leidis kohus, et siseriiklik norm on tühine. Oma järelduseni jõudmiseks tugines kohus tugevalt lepingute heas usus täitmisele, nagu on ette nähtud VCLT artiklis 26 (Linija vs. Läti, 2004).<br/><br/>Järeldus:<br/><br/>Eeltoodust nähtub selgelt, et aluslepingutel on erinõuded, enne kui neid saab pidada isetäituvateks, kuid kõige olulisem on siiski liikmesriikide kohtute tõlgendus. Siseriiklikud kohtud otsustavad, kas lepingut võib pidada isetäitvaks või mitte. Kuigi nende põhiseadus võib sisaldada sätet, et lepinguõigus on riigi ülim õigus, tõlgendavad eri riikide kohtud neid sätteid erinevalt. Seda võib näha sellest, kuidas Ameerika ja Dominikaani põhiseadused mõlemad sisaldavad neid sätteid, kuid järgivad nende täiesti erinevaid tõlgendusi. Nende lepingute puhul ei pruugi mõiste „enesetäitmine” olla kooskõlas, sest praktikas vajavad nad siiski liikmesriikide kohtute heakskiitu. Ideaalis peaks edasiliikumine toimuma siis, kui riigid tunnistavad lepingute isetäituvat olemust ja kohtlevad neid viisil, mis on kooskõlas Viini konventsiooni artiklitega 26 ja 27. Jällegi on see "ideaalne" olukord ja tõenäoliselt ei leia see peagi teatud jurisdiktsioonide riigipraktikas. Siiski võib lootust võita, uurides liikmesriikide kohtute tõlgendusi, mis neid norme austavad ja loodetavasti sillutavad teed teistele kohtutele, et seda tunnistada.<br/><br/>Viited:<br/><br/>Buergenthal, T.

| Behind-the-Scenes Tragedies That Affected the Cast of TV's Deadliest Catch<br/><br/>Lowered Fishing Quotas<br/><br/>Even though the crew on Deadliest Catch make the majority of their money from Discovery, that doesn't mean they don't actually sell their haul. So, you could say they have two sources of income, which is something that most people in their line of work don't have.<br/><br/>However, back in 2017, the Alaska Department of Fish and Game started a quota system, which limited the amount of fish any fishing boat could bring back to shore by half. That meant the crew on Deadliest Catch experienced a huge drop in profits for several years. Hey, at least they have Discovery to pay the bills, right? | Stseenide Taga Tragöödiad, Mis Mõjutasid Televisiooni Kõige Surmavamat Püüdmist<br/><br/>Vähendatud püügikvoodid<br/><br/>Kuigi Deadliest Catchi meeskond teenib suurema osa oma rahast Discovery'st, ei tähenda see, et nad tegelikult ei müü oma veoseid. Nii et võib öelda, et neil on kaks sissetulekuallikat, mis on midagi, mida enamikul inimestel nende töövaldkonnas ei ole.<br/><br/>Kuid 2017. aastal alustas Alaska kala- ja ulukiliha osakond kvoodisüsteemi, mis piiras kalakogust, mida iga kalalaev võiks kaldale tagasi tuua, poole võrra. See tähendas, et Deadliest Catchi meeskond koges mitu aastat tohutut kasumi langust. Hei, vähemalt on neil Discovery arvete maksmiseks, eks? |

| BLOGS<br/><br/>Check out our collection of blogs written by fellow staff members.<br/><br/>INFORMATIONAL BLOGS<br/><br/>Don't Stress It<br/><br/>by<br/>Kristen Hogan<br/>&#124; Nov 12, 2020<br/><br/>Stress, no matter how great things are going, it can always find a way to rear its ugly head. Whether it is a last-minute job request or a paper that you forgot to write and it is due the next day, stress can always find a way into your day if you allow it. Today I will show you a few things you can do to eliminate or prevent stress.<br/><br/>The first thing you can do is to exercise. Exercising is a great way to relieve stress because it lowers the stress hormone in your body known as cortisol. The lower levels of cortisol in your body, the lower your stress level will be. Exercise can also increase your confidence, and when your confidence is up then your stress is usually down. For me, when I get stressed, I always exercise by going to the gym and practice boxing, it helps me burn calories and reduce stress while having fun.<br/><br/>Writing things down has been a way to calm people down for a very long time, and it is the next topic on our list. Writing down what is making you stressed is a way to clear the mind, and it helps get rid of stress as well. I have a similar experience when writing stories, usually if I cannot think of a new idea because of an old one, I will write the old idea down and think on it. That is when new ideas start to spring up and I can continue writing normally. It is the same with stress. Think about a stream it continues to flow down it's path until it hits a beaver dam, and that dam blocks the flow of water and everything starts to build up. The only way to get the water flow back to normal is to remove the dam. This is where writing comes in. When you write it down, you are removing stress piece by piece until you can think normally again.<br/><br/>Stress can come into our lives through doors in our life that we keep open. Procrastination is a way that we can leave the doors open for stress. Waiting until tomorrow may be fun for today, but it will hurt you tomorrow, and is a very short-sighted solution. The longer you wait to do something, the larger that something becomes, and the larger it becomes the more stress you will be inviting into your life. Taking care of something as soon as we receive it is a great way to prevent stress, but it is something that takes great discipline to do. The more you cut Procrastination out of your life, the more stress free you will be. So shut that door, you're letting all the cold air out.<br/><br/>So let's review: Exercise, Write down what is stressing you, and Do not Procrastinate. These are only a few ways to relieve stress but to me, they are the most effective. While I know these may not work for everyone I would like to invite anyone feeling stressed to research how to get rid of it. | BLOGID<br/><br/>Tutvuge meie blogide kollektsiooniga, mille on kirjutanud kaastöötajad.<br/><br/>INFORMATSIOONI BLOGID<br/><br/>Ärge stressige seda<br/><br/>poolt<br/>Kristen Hogan<br/>© EENet 2019<br/><br/>Stress, ükskõik kui suured asjad lähevad, võib see alati leida viisi, kuidas oma kole pea üles tõsta. Kas see on viimase hetke töötaotlus või paber, mille unustasite kirjutada ja see on tingitud järgmisel päeval, võib stress alati leida oma päeva, kui te seda lubate. Täna näitan teile mõningaid asju, mida saate teha stressi kõrvaldamiseks või vältimiseks.<br/><br/>Esimene asi, mida saate teha, on kasutada. Harjutus on suurepärane võimalus leevendada stressi, sest see vähendab stressi hormooni organismis tuntud kui kortisooli. Madalama kortisooli tase kehas, seda madalam on teie stressi tase. Harjutus võib suurendada ka teie usaldust ja kui teie usaldus on üles, siis on teie stress tavaliselt alla. Minu jaoks, kui ma saan rõhutada, ma alati kasutada, minnes jõusaali ja harjutada poks, see aitab mul põletada kaloreid ja vähendada stressi samas lõbus.<br/><br/>Kirjutamine asjad on olnud nii, et rahustada inimesi maha väga pikka aega, ja see on järgmine teema meie nimekirjas. Kirjutamine, mis teeb sind rõhutada on viis puhastada meelt, ja see aitab vabaneda stressi samuti. Mul on sarnane kogemus lugude kirjutamisel, tavaliselt kui ma ei suuda vana idee tõttu uut ideed välja mõelda, kirjutan vana idee üles ja mõtlen sellele. See on siis, kui uued ideed hakkavad välja tulema ja ma saan normaalselt kirjutada. See on sama stressiga. Mõelge voolule, mis voolab alla oma teed, kuni see tabab kobrase tammi ja see tamm blokeerib veevoolu ja kõik hakkab kogunema. Ainus viis veevoolu normaliseerimiseks on tammi eemaldamine. See on koht, kus kirjutamine tuleb sisse. Kui kirjutate selle üles, eemaldate stressi tükkhaaval, kuni saate normaalselt mõelda.<br/><br/>Stress võib tulla meie elu läbi uste meie elu, et me hoiame avatud. Viivitamine on viis, kuidas me saame jätta uksed lahti stressi. Homseni ootamine võib olla täna lõbus, kuid see teeb sulle homme haiget ja on väga lühinägelik lahendus. Mida kauem sa ootad, et midagi teha, seda suuremaks midagi muutub, ja mida suurem see muutub, seda rohkem stressi te kutsute oma elu. Hoolitsedes midagi niipea, kui me saame see on suurepärane võimalus vältida stressi, kuid see on midagi, mis võtab suurt distsipliini teha. Mida rohkem sa lõigatud Viivitamine oma elust, seda rohkem stressivaba sa oled. Nii et pane uks kinni, sa lased külma õhu välja.<br/><br/>Nii et vaatame: Harjutus, Kirjutage üles, mis teid rõhutab, ja ärge viivitage. Need on vaid mõned viisid stressi leevendamiseks, kuid minu jaoks on need kõige tõhusamad. Kuigi ma tean, et need ei pruugi kõigile töötada, tahaksin kutsuda kõiki, kes tunnevad stressi, et uurida, kuidas sellest vabaneda. |
