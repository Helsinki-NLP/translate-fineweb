| There is a well known quote by Plato who once said: "I would teach children music, physics and philosophy, but most importantly music for the patterns in music and all the arts are the keys to learning.<br/><br/>Whatever your religion or culture music will always play and important part. It often defines what is essentially unique about a particular group of people and helps to create a sense of community. Dr Shinichi Suzuki describes his teaching this way: 'Teaching music is not my main purpose. I want to make good citizens. If a child hears fine music from the day of his birth and learns to play it himself, he develops sensitivity, discipline and endurance. He gets a beautiful heart. Along with improving self-esteem and self-expression their are also benefits that include increasing memory and is believed that learning music can boost academic achievement. Although the exact mechanics of this is often not understood, the belief is that learning music stimulates parts of the brain that then have a carry-over impact on all academic areas.<br/><br/>Research indicates that the brain of a musician, even a young one works differently than that of a non-musician. In the field of Neuroscience research has shown that a larger proportion of neural pathways are used in learning music as the brain has to work harder.<br/><br/>There is a link between this and improved spacial-temporal skills that help in solving multistep problems such as in the fields of maths, engineering and the arts.<br/><br/>It also provides structure and focus which may benefit other areas of learning. As well as bringing, structure, organisation and discipline which carries over into other areas of your childs life we must not forget the most important fact about learning music. It brings enjoyment and a sense of fun. | Platon on öelnud: "Ma õpetaksin lastele muusikat, füüsikat ja filosoofiat, kuid kõige tähtsam on see, et muusika ja kõik kunstid on õppimise võtmed.<br/><br/>Ükskõik oma religiooni või kultuuri muusika alati mängida ja oluline osa. See sageli määratleb, mis on sisuliselt unikaalne umbes konkreetse rühma inimesi ja aitab luua kogukonnatunnet. Dr Shinichi Suzuki kirjeldab oma õpetust nii: "Muusika õpetamine ei ole minu peamine eesmärk. Ma tahan teha häid kodanikke. Kui laps kuuleb head muusikat oma sünnipäevast ja õpib seda ise mängima, arendab ta tundlikkust, distsipliini ja vastupidavust. Lisaks enesehinnangu ja eneseväljenduse parandamisele on neil ka eeliseid, mis hõlmavad mälu suurendamist ja usutakse, et muusika õppimine võib suurendada akadeemilisi saavutusi. Kuigi selle täpne mehaanika ei ole sageli arusaadav, usutakse, et muusika õppimine stimuleerib aju osi, millel on seejärel ülekanduv mõju kõigile akadeemilistele valdkondadele.<br/><br/>Uuringud näitavad, et muusiku aju, isegi noor, töötab erinevalt kui mittemuusik. Neuroscience'i valdkonnas on uuringud näidanud, et muusika õppimisel kasutatakse suuremat osa närviradadest, kuna aju peab rohkem tööd tegema.<br/><br/>Selle ja täiustatud ruumiliste ja ajaliste oskuste vahel on seos, mis aitab lahendada mitmeastmelisi probleeme, näiteks matemaatika, inseneriteaduse ja kunsti valdkonnas.<br/><br/>See pakub ka struktuuri ja fookust, mis võib olla kasulik teistele õppevaldkondadele. Lisaks sellele, et tuua, struktuur, organiseeritus ja distsipliin, mis viib edasi teistesse valdkondadesse oma laste elu, ei tohi me unustada kõige olulisemat fakti muusika õppimise kohta. See toob naudingut ja lõbusust. |

| Breaking out of the Box Fay Tsitou investigates moving objects in British museums<br/><br/>Objects are the main 'protagonists' in two different fields: museums and puppetry. In both cases, the objects enable us to interact with our surroundings, our past, and our inner self.<br/><br/>Museum visitors perceive a vast majority of the museum objects from a distance, while these remain mainly static and mute in or outside the galleries' showcases. On the other hand, puppet theatre audiences join the world of moving objects/puppets that are often literally given a voice (sound or speech). Nevertheless, is there a common ground of static and moving objects worth exploring in these contexts?<br/><br/>Museum Puppetry Research<br/><br/>Museum puppetry adopts the language of puppetry within museum exhibitions. It aims at investigating the interaction among museum visitors, objects' stories, exhibits' histories and exhibitions' narratives. It examines how object-centred activities discretely disguise their visitor-centred identity while they enable visitors to free their mind and heart from possible inhibitions or preconceptions. Museum puppetry is a type of museum learning activity, similar to and often combined with museum theatre. However, as G.B. Shaw might say, 'the actor in his primitive form' (i.e. the puppet) unblocks the audiences' imagination which '…plays a far greater part than the exertions of the actors'.<br/><br/>Museum puppetry examples in UK<br/><br/>There are a number of variables that characterise a museum puppetry activity, such as the type of museum, the type of puppetry, the target group, the activity area in the museum, the degree of interaction among the four units (participants, exhibits/collections, puppets, practitioners), the use of verbal and/or object language. For instance, one type of activity could be a complete show around a museum's performing object, as for example in the Keswick museum in Cumbria where Ali Mc Caw presented a wayang kulit style performance, The Musical Stonemason. The show combined shadow and table-top puppetry with a gamelan orchestra which incorporated a museum object, the musical stone of Skiddaw. Moreover, shows can be related to an exhibit's narrative. For example Professor Geoff Felix's popular Punch and Judy street puppet theatre show was presented in the garden of the Geoffrey Museum and at the Museum of London as part of the Victoria Street exhibit (It is no surprise to learn that Felix's beautifully crafted booth was once mistaken for an exhibit as it was standing in an open area at the same museum!)<br/><br/>Other examples include:<br/><br/>A workshop on puppet construction and manipulation - like the skilfully structured workshop that follows Anna Ingleby's shadow puppetry shows<br/><br/>A puppet workshop based on the museum's handling collection - as this happens at the Horniman Museum (London) to acquaint primary school students with the various types of puppets<br/><br/>A puppet exhibit - like the automata or the dinosaur animatronics in the Natural History Museum in London<br/><br/>Creative learning processes with the use of everyday objects - as these are facilitated by Hedsor Creative Learning, to enhance museum interpretation in places such as Sheffield Museums and Galleries Trust and Manchester City Art Gallery<br/><br/>A museum tour with the puppet as a storyteller/facilitator - like Vivien Mousdell's palaeontologist Dr. Ambrose in her puppet show Fossils Alive<br/><br/>An outreach programme - like Jill Webster's interactive puppet show Pirates! All Hands on Deck!, commissioned by Glasgow Science Centre<br/><br/>Manipulation of puppets that belong to original collections is considered par excellence a museum puppetry case - as John Mc Cormick performed with the Victorian Marionettes at the Museum Theatre in London.<br/><br/>The following cases further illuminate the multifaceted potential of performing objects in museums.<br/><br/>'Authentic' metaphors<br/><br/>For twenty-five years adult museum visitors have been enjoying Robert Poulter's New Model Theatre shows in conjunction with special exhibitions and collections, in numerous European and US museums. During Poulter's sophisticated toy theatre shows, paper figures travel smoothly in time and space while interacting with each other and their stage environment. Backdrops are changing continuously. The audience perceives the world represented on stage neither as something static, nor fragmented, but fluidly constructed moment by moment. Although puppetry favours mythological and fictional stories, Poulter makes use of his talent in painting and research skills to interpret selectively historical evidence via flat figures and settings that move vertically and horizontally. The elaborate, live montage evolves as fast and as easy, as the turning of a page. For example, during the art history show Mr Turner Gets Steamed Up, action moves instantly from Margate to London, or from the view out of Turner's window onto the canvas of his famous paintings. The liberties taken with the spoken and visual narrative are noted in detail on the program of the show, allowing Poulter's beautifully crafted paper figures to stand bravely as ultimate 'authentic' metaphors on a miniature stage of History.<br/><br/>Multi-sensory experience<br/><br/>Real coffee beans, shells and cloves cover small wooden boats which sail in a Museum of Docklands' performance originally devised for visitors with the most complex educational needs. The boats' cargo can be smelled and felt as they (metaphorically) travel over the sea to London's Victorian docks in a storytelling piece entitled Over the Sea to London, devised by Emily Capstick and Alison Hale (Peoplescape Theatre). Peoplescape have been creating participatory performances in community, education and museum settings for twelve years. Taking advantage of applied theatre techniques, live music and puppetry's rich potential and flexibility, Capstick and Hale replace verbal description of the past with live action in the present. They create a multi-sensory engaging experience for an audience in-role role with the use of puppets and manipulated objects, without relying on verbal communication.<br/><br/>Popular art<br/><br/>Last year, Dr Matthew Isaac Cohen, as a dhalang shadow puppeteer performed his Ramayana in four parts with the Southbank Gamelan Players at the British Library, where an exhibition under the same title explored how the Indian epic story is retold over the centuries. Similarly to a presentation to an Indonesian audience (who enjoy a great deal of freedom in watching the popular story – spectators can move around, take a nap, leave the show and return!), the Library's audience could watch the nearly three-hour performance seated on pillows or circulating around it. During the show, the spectators could also either move towards the exhibition area to enjoy a museum experience while still hearing the superb chanting and music, or they could go behind the screen and the performers to have a drink while still enjoying the delightful puppet show from the back, viewed through a door opening. While standing in the middle, the wayang kulit Indonesian type of shadow puppetry created an intimate in-between space bridging two worlds: art and life.<br/><br/>Two remarkable cases outside UK<br/><br/>In 2002, a Brooklyn-based constructor/puppeteer, Chris Green, was commissioned to create a part of Noah's Ark exhibit in the Skirball Cultural Center in LA. His sophisticated kinetic or fully manipulated installations – interactive exhibits and puppets manipulated by the museum staff – were made of recycled materials and today attract people of all ages and backgrounds. The Noah's Ark exhibit received awards of excellence from the American Association of Museums and Themed Entertainment Association.<br/><br/>In 2001, the renowned French director Philippe Philippe Genty presented Le Concert Incroyable in the Grande Salle de l' Evolution in the Natural History Museum of Paris. High technology projections of inventive graphic designs were used and interacted with the central exhibit of the gallery: a march that consisted of large mummified animals. This puppet and physical theatre show was a composition of mesmerising images, dramatic action and chorus singing; a unique experience for an adult audience.<br/><br/>So, as we can see museum puppetry embraces a far broader spectrum of practice than might at first be thought! To perceive museums as just another sort of venue, and museum puppetry as a merely a medium suitable to attract preschoolers with their families during Christmas period, is limiting. Recognising the performing objects' potential and communicative power, some museums support their use for their activities and learning programmes year-round.<br/><br/>In fact, these are the museums that foster a close relation between the two inanimate 'soul brothers': museum exhibits and performing objects. In the hands of the experts, such interactions give an extra meaning to an old mystery: '…Inanimate objects / have you then a soul / That clings to our soul / and forces it to love?...' (Alphonse Lamartine, Milly ou la terre natale, 1822)<br/><br/>George Bernard Shaw quotation is taken from his introduction to Max Von Boehn's Puppets and Automata (Dover Publications. New York, 1972, trans. Josephine Nicoll) | Fay Tsitou uurib Briti muuseumides liikuvaid objekte<br/><br/>Objektid on peamised "peategelased" kahes erinevas valdkonnas: muuseumid ja nukud. Mõlemal juhul võimaldavad objektid meil suhelda meie ümbrusega, meie minevikuga ja meie sisemise minaga.<br/><br/>Muuseumi külastajad tajuvad suuremat osa muuseumiobjektidest kaugelt, samas kui need jäävad peamiselt staatiliseks ja vaikivaks galeriide vitriinides või väljaspool. Teisest küljest liitub nukuteatri publik liikuvate objektide/nukkude maailmaga, mis on sageli sõna otseses mõttes antud hääl (heli või kõne). Kuid kas on olemas staatiliste ja liikuvate objektide ühine alus, mida tasub nendes kontekstides uurida?<br/><br/>Muuseumi nukuteadus<br/><br/>Muuseumi nukukunstis kasutatakse muuseuminäitustel nukukunsti keelt, mille eesmärk on uurida muuseumikülastajate, objektide lugude, eksponaatide ajaloo ja näituste narratiivide vastastikust mõju. Uuritakse, kuidas objektikesksed tegevused varjavad diskreetselt oma külastajakeskset identiteeti, võimaldades külastajatel vabastada oma meelt ja südant võimalikest takistustest või eelarvamustest. Muuseumi nukud on muuseumi õppetegevus, mis sarnaneb ja sageli kombineeritakse muuseumiteatriga. Kuid nagu G.B. Shaw võib öelda, "näitleja oma primitiivsel kujul" (st nukk) vabastab publiku kujutlusvõime, mis "... mängib palju suuremat osa kui näitlejate pingutused".<br/><br/>Muuseumi nukunäited Ühendkuningriigis<br/><br/>Muuseumi nukuteatri tegevust iseloomustavad mitmed muutujad, näiteks muuseumi tüüp, nukuteatri tüüp, sihtrühm, muuseumi tegevusala, nelja üksuse (osalejad, eksponaadid / kogud, nukud, praktikud), verbaalse ja / või objektikeele kasutamine. Näiteks üks tegevus võib olla täielik näitus muuseumi esineva objekti ümber, nagu näiteks Keswicki muuseum Cumbrias, kus Ali Mc Caw esitas wayang kulit stiilis etenduse Muusikaline Stonemason. Näitus ühendas varju ja laua-top nukud gamelani orkestriga, mis sisaldas muuseumiobjekti, Skiddawi muusikalist kivi. Lisaks võivad näitused olla seotud eksponaadi narratiiviga. Näiteks professor Geoff Felixi populaarne Punch ja Judy tänava nukuteatri näitus oli Geoffrey muuseumi aias ja Londoni muuseumis Victoria tänava näituse osana (Pole üllatav, et Felixi kaunilt kujundatud boksi peeti kunagi eksponaadiks, kuna see seisis samas muuseumis avatud alal!)<br/><br/>Muud näited on:<br/><br/>Nukute ehitamise ja manipuleerimise töötuba - nagu Anna Ingleby varju nukuteatrile järgnev oskuslikult struktureeritud töötuba<br/><br/>Nukutöökoda, mis põhineb muuseumi käitlemiskogul - nagu see juhtub Hornimani muuseumis (London), et tutvustada algkooliõpilasi erinevate nukutüüpidega<br/><br/>Nukunäitus - nagu automata või dinosaurus animatronics Londoni loodusmuuseumis<br/><br/>Loomingulised õppeprotsessid igapäevaste objektide abil - kuna neid hõlbustab Hedsor Creative Learning, et parandada muuseumide tõlgendamist sellistes kohtades nagu Sheffieldi muuseumid ja galeriid ning Manchester City kunstigalerii<br/><br/>Muuseumi ekskursioon nukuga jutuvestjana / vahendajana - nagu Vivien Mousdelli paleontoloog Dr Ambrose oma nukunäitusel Fossils Alive<br/><br/>Teavitusprogramm - nagu Jill Websteri interaktiivne nukunäitus Piraadid! Kõik käed tekil!, tellitud Glasgowi teaduskeskusest<br/><br/>Originaalkogudesse kuuluvate nukude manipuleerimist peetakse par excellence muuseumi nukutehase juhtumiks - nagu John Mc Cormick esines Londoni muuseumiteatris Victorian Marionettes.<br/><br/>Järgnevad juhtumid valgustavad veelgi muuseumides esinevate objektide mitmekülgset potentsiaali.<br/><br/>‘Tõelised’ metafoorid<br/><br/>Täiskasvanute muuseumi külastajad on 25 aastat nautinud Robert Poulteri New Model Theatre'i näitusi koos erinäituste ja kogudega paljudes Euroopa ja USA muuseumides. Poulteri keerukate mänguteatrietenduste ajal liiguvad paberist figuurid sujuvalt ajas ja ruumis, suhtledes üksteisega ja oma lavakeskkonnaga. Taustapildid muutuvad pidevalt. Publik tajub laval esindatud maailma mitte kui midagi staatilist ega fragmenteeritud, vaid voogavalt konstrueeritud hetkest hetke. Kuigi nukud eelistavad mütoloogilisi ja väljamõeldud lugusid, kasutab Poulter oma maalimis- ja uurimisoskusi, et tõlgendada selektiivselt ajaloolisi tõendeid vertikaalselt ja horisontaalselt liikuvate lamedate arvude ja seadete kaudu. Keerukas, reaalajas monteerimine areneb sama kiiresti ja lihtsalt kui lehekülje pööramine. Näiteks kunstiajaloo näituse ajal hr Turner saab aurutatud, tegevus liigub kohe Margate'ist Londonisse või Turneri aknast välja tema kuulsate maalide lõuendile. Vabadused, mis on võetud suulise ja visuaalse narratiiviga, on üksikasjalikult märgitud näituse programmis, võimaldades Poulteri kaunilt kujundatud paberifiguuridel vapralt seista kui ülimad "autentsed" metafoorid ajaloo miniatuursel etapil.<br/><br/>Multisensoorne kogemus<br/><br/>Tõelised kohvioad, kestad ja nelgid katavad väikesed puidust paadid, mis sõidavad Docklandi muuseumi esituses, mis on algselt mõeldud kõige keerukamate haridusvajadustega külastajatele. Laevade lasti saab haista ja tunda, kui nad (metafooriliselt) reisivad üle mere Londoni viktoriaanlikesse sadamatesse jutustavas teoses pealkirjaga Over the Sea to London, mille on välja töötanud Emily Capstick ja Alison Hale (Peoplescape Theatre). Peoplescape on loonud osalusdemokraatia etendusi kogukonna, hariduse ja muuseumi seaded kaksteist aastat. Kasutades rakenduslikke teatritehnikaid, elavat muusikat ja nukukunsti rikkalikku potentsiaali ja paindlikkust, asendavad Capstick ja Hale mineviku verbaalse kirjelduse elava tegevusega olevikus. Nad loovad multi-sensoorne kaasates kogemus publiku rolli kasutades nukud ja manipuleeritud objektid, ilma tuginedes verbaalne suhtlemine.<br/><br/>Populaarne kunst<br/><br/>Eelmisel aastal esitas dr Matthew Isaac Cohen dhalangi varju nukunäitlejana oma Ramayana neljas osas koos Southbank Gamelani mängijatega Briti raamatukogus, kus sama pealkirja all olev näitus uuris, kuidas India eepiline lugu on sajandite jooksul ümber räägitud. Sarnaselt esitlusele Indoneesia publikule (kes naudivad suurt vabadust populaarse loo vaatamisel - pealtvaatajad saavad ringi liikuda, uinaku teha, etenduselt lahkuda ja tagasi tulla!), raamatukogu publik võiks vaadata ligi kolme tunni pikkust esitust, mis istub padjadel või ringleb selle ümber. Näituse ajal võisid pealtvaatajad kas liikuda näituseala poole, et nautida muuseumielamust, kuulates endiselt suurepärast laulmist ja muusikat, või minna ekraani ja esinejate taha, et nautida jooki, nautides samal ajal tagaküljel olevat mõnusat nukunäitust, vaadatuna läbi ukseava. Keskel seistes lõi wayang kulit Indoneesia tüüpi varju nukud intiimse ruumi, mis ühendab kahte maailma: kunst ja elu.<br/><br/>Kaks tähelepanuväärset juhtumit väljaspool Ühendkuningriiki<br/><br/>2002. aastal telliti Brooklynis asuv konstruktor / nukuteater Chris Green, et luua osa Noah's Arki eksponaadist Los Angelese Skirballi kultuurikeskuses. Tema keerukad kineetilised või täielikult manipuleeritud installatsioonid – muuseumi personali poolt manipuleeritud interaktiivsed eksponaadid ja nukud – olid valmistatud ringlussevõetud materjalidest ja meelitavad tänapäeval ligi igas vanuses ja erineva taustaga inimesi. Noa laeva näitus sai Ameerika Muuseumite Assotsiatsiooni ja Temaatilise Meelelahutuse Assotsiatsiooni tipptaseme auhindu.<br/><br/>2001. aastal esitles tuntud prantsuse režissöör Philippe Genty Pariisi loodusloo muuseumis Grande Salle de l'Evolution’is „Uskumatu kontsert“. Kasutati leidlike graafiliste kujunduste kõrgtehnoloogilisi projektsioone ja interakteeruti galerii keskse eksponaadiga: marss, mis koosnes suurtest mumifitseeritud loomadest. See nuku- ja füüsilise teatri etendus oli kompositsioon lummavatest piltidest, dramaatilisest tegevusest ja koorilaulust; ainulaadne kogemus täiskasvanud publikule.<br/><br/>Niisiis, nagu me näeme, hõlmab muuseumi nukukunst palju laiemat praktika spektrit, kui esialgu arvati! Muuseumide tajumine lihtsalt teise kohana ja muuseumi nukud kui pelgalt meedium, mis sobib eelkooliealiste meelitamiseks oma peredega jõulude ajal, on piirav. Tunnistades esinevate objektide potentsiaali ja suhtlemisvõimet, toetavad mõned muuseumid nende kasutamist oma tegevuses ja õppeprogrammides aastaringselt.<br/><br/>Tegelikult on need muuseumid, mis edendavad lähedast suhet kahe elutu "hinge vennad": muuseumi eksponaadid ja esinevad objektid. Ekspertide kätes annavad sellised koostoimed vanale müsteeriumile täiendava tähenduse: "... Kas sul on hing, mis klammerdub meie hinge külge ja sunnib seda armastama?“ (Alphonse Lamartine, Milly ou la terre natale, 1822)<br/><br/>George Bernard Shaw tsitaat on võetud tema sissejuhatus Max von Boehn's Nukud ja Automata (Dover Publications.

We must maintain the momentum gained on these issues in the high-level panel through to the final deliberations at the UN General Assembly in 2014 on global goals for poverty eradication and sustainable development. Now more than ever, we need to recognise the centrality of gender equality. Now more than ever, we must end gender inequality as the grand objective of the 21st century.<br/><br/>Promoting gender equality in the post-2015 agenda includes finishing the work that the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) started. Unfortunately, the MDGs that are most off-track are those directly linked to achieving gender equality, such as reducing maternal mortality and ensuring universal reproductive health and rights. There is by now overwhelming evidence that gender inequality severely constrains women's independence and freedom, control over their own bodies, sexuality and childbearing, and restricts their life choices and opportunities in terms of education and work. There is also abundant evidence that it significantly slows economic growth in both rich and poor countries.<br/><br/>Across the world, in all societies, women and girls consistently face a range of barriers to equality - such as wage gaps, gender-based violence, child marriage and female genital mutilation. The poor and otherwise socially disadvantaged are further marginalised through crippling combinations of gender discrimination and poverty discrimination. Therefore, tackling the gender inequalities and critical barriers that prevent women and girls from exercising their rights and empowering themselves must be at the heart of our efforts to create sustainable, prosperous and resilient societies.<br/><br/>Achieving gender equality - including women's rights, women's health and women's empowerment - is not only a means to eradicating poverty and achieving sustainable development, it is an important end in itself.<br/><br/>Landmark documents such as the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development, and the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action have long established that women's rights are human rights. CEDAW, established in 1979 and ratified by almost every country in the world, places responsibility for ensuring equal rights for men and women with the state. Women must be offered the same access to all aspects of life as men in order to reach equal status.<br/><br/>We have not achieved this yet. Therefore, we are recommending that the UN General Assembly consider effectively tackling this challenge, and the unfinished business of the MDGs, by ensuring that gender equality and sexual and reproductive health are at the centre of the post-2015 development agenda, with relevant goals, targets and indicators approved.<br/><br/>This proposal has strong support among a wide range of stakeholders and development actors, including many governments, multilateral agencies and civil society organisations. The respective national, regional and global thematic consultations on health, inequalities and education in the post-2015 agenda, as well as the Rio+20 outcome document's framework for action and follow-up, have all stressed the centrality of gender equality and women's empowerment.<br/><br/>The MDGs created an unprecedented mobilisation of political will and resources in recent years, not least around MDGs 4 and 5 related to reducing maternal and infant death. Both of these goals are inextricably linked to gender equality and the rights, health and empowerment of women and girls. It is essential for our common efforts regarding these to be carried over and further strengthened in the post-2015 agenda. Including goals on gender equality and sexual and reproductive health and rights in the post-2015 agenda will highlight, once again, the central role of women's rights as human rights. The panel report has given a strong momentum for these issues - now it is up to all of us global actors to maintain it, and make sure that it survives all the way to 2015.<br/><br/>We are at a decisive point in our common history when our policy intentions and actions will shape the future of human development and our planet in the face of both unprecedented achievements and persistent challenges. Let us ensure that the post-2015 agenda is truly universal and inclusive, and that the ultimate goal is a world where all - men, women, young people and children - are treated as equally worthy lens is suitable for general macro work but if you want greater subject-to-lens distance a 100mm lens will give you this at a price.

Peaaegu 20 aastat hiljem jääb naiste õiguste tagamine väljakutseks.<br/><br/>30. mail avaldas ÜRO peasekretäri 2015. aasta järgse arengukava kõrgetasemeline töörühm oma aruande, mis sisaldab eraldiseisvat eesmärki soolise võrdõiguslikkuse ning naiste ja tütarlaste mõjuvõimu suurendamise kohta. Lisaks sisaldab illustreeriv terviseeesmärk eesmärki tagada üldine seksuaal- ja reproduktiivtervis ning -õigused.<br/><br/>Sooline võrdõiguslikkus ning üldise seksuaal- ja reproduktiivtervise ja -õiguste tagamine on säästva arengu olulised koostisosad. Me peame säilitama nendes küsimustes kõrgetasemelisel vaekogul saavutatud hoogu kuni 2014. aastal ÜRO Peaassambleel toimuvate lõplike aruteludeni vaesuse kaotamise ja säästva arengu ülemaailmsete eesmärkide üle. Nüüd, rohkem kui kunagi varem, peame tunnistama soolise võrdõiguslikkuse keskset tähtsust. Nüüd, rohkem kui kunagi varem, peame lõpetama soolise ebavõrdsuse kui 21. sajandi peamise eesmärgi.<br/><br/>Soolise võrdõiguslikkuse edendamine 2015. aasta järgses tegevuskavas hõlmab aastatuhande arengueesmärkidega alustatud töö lõpetamist. Kahjuks on aastatuhande arengueesmärgid, mis on kõige enam kõrvale kaldunud, otseselt seotud soolise võrdõiguslikkuse saavutamisega, näiteks emade suremuse vähendamine ning üldise reproduktiivtervise ja -õiguste tagamine. Praeguseks on ülekaalukalt tõendeid selle kohta, et sooline ebavõrdsus piirab tõsiselt naiste iseseisvust ja vabadust, kontrolli nende endi keha üle, seksuaalsust ja viljakust ning piirab nende eluvalikuid ja võimalusi hariduse ja töö osas. Samuti on rohkesti tõendeid selle kohta, et see aeglustab märkimisväärselt nii rikaste kui ka vaeste riikide majanduskasvu.<br/><br/>Üle kogu maailma seisavad naised ja tüdrukud kõigis ühiskondades pidevalt silmitsi mitmete võrdõiguslikkusega seotud takistustega, nagu palgalõhed, sooline vägivald, laste abielud ja naiste suguelundite moonutamine. Vaeseid ja muidu sotsiaalselt ebasoodsas olukorras olevaid inimesi marginaliseerib veelgi sooline diskrimineerimine ja vaesusega seotud diskrimineerimine. Seetõttu peab soolise ebavõrdsuse ja kriitiliste tõkete kõrvaldamine, mis takistavad naistel ja tütarlastel oma õigusi kasutada ja ennast suurendada, olema meie jõupingutuste keskmes jätkusuutlike, jõukate ja vastupanuvõimeliste ühiskondade loomisel.<br/><br/>Soolise võrdõiguslikkuse saavutamine - sealhulgas naiste õigused, naiste tervis ja naiste mõjuvõimu suurendamine - ei ole mitte ainult vahend vaesuse kaotamiseks ja säästva arengu saavutamiseks, vaid ka oluline eesmärk omaette.<br/><br/>Märkimisväärsed dokumendid, nagu konventsioon naiste diskrimineerimise kõigi vormide likvideerimise kohta (CEDAW), rahvusvahelise rahvastiku- ja arengukonverentsi tegevusprogramm ning Pekingi deklaratsioon ja tegevusplatvorm, on juba ammu kinnitanud, et naiste õigused on inimõigused. CEDAW, mis loodi 1979. aastal ja mille on ratifitseerinud peaaegu kõik maailma riigid, paneb vastutuse meeste ja naiste võrdsete õiguste tagamise eest riigiga. Naistele tuleb võrdse staatuse saavutamiseks pakkuda meestega võrdset juurdepääsu kõikidele eluvaldkondadele.<br/><br/>Me ei ole seda veel saavutanud. Seetõttu soovitame ÜRO Peaassambleel kaaluda selle väljakutse ja aastatuhande arengueesmärkide pooleliolevate küsimuste tõhusat käsitlemist, tagades, et sooline võrdõiguslikkus ning seksuaal- ja reproduktiivtervis on 2015. aasta järgse arengukava keskmes ning asjakohased eesmärgid, eesmärgid ja näitajad on heaks kiidetud.<br/><br/>Käesolevat ettepanekut toetavad tugevalt paljud sidusrühmad ja arenguvaldkonnas osalejad, sealhulgas paljud valitsused, mitmepoolsed asutused ja kodanikuühiskonna organisatsioonid. 2015. aasta järgses tegevuskavas tervishoiu, ebavõrdsuse ja hariduse teemal toimunud riiklikud, piirkondlikud ja ülemaailmsed temaatilised konsultatsioonid ning Rio+20 lõppdokumendis esitatud meetmete ja järelmeetmete raamistik on kõik rõhutanud soolise võrdõiguslikkuse ja naiste mõjuvõimu suurendamise keskset tähtsust.<br/><br/>Aastatuhande arengueesmärgid on viimastel aastatel loonud enneolematu poliitilise tahte ja ressursside mobiliseerimise, eelkõige seoses aastatuhande arengueesmärkidega 4 ja 5, mis on seotud emade ja imikute suremuse vähendamisega. Mõlemad eesmärgid on lahutamatult seotud soolise võrdõiguslikkuse ning naiste ja tütarlaste õiguste, tervise ja mõjuvõimu suurendamisega. On oluline, et meie ühised jõupingutused nendes küsimustes kajastuksid 2015. aasta järgses tegevuskavas ja et neid veelgi tugevdataks. Soolise võrdõiguslikkuse ning seksuaal- ja reproduktiivtervise ja -õiguste eesmärkide lisamine 2015. aasta järgsesse tegevuskavasse tõstab taas esile naiste õiguste keskset rolli inimõigustena. Vaekogu aruanne on andnud nendele küsimustele tugeva tõuke - nüüd on meie kõigi, ülemaailmsete osalejate ülesanne seda säilitada ja tagada, et see jääb püsima kuni 2015. aastani.<br/><br/>Oleme oma ühises ajaloos otsustaval hetkel, mil meie poliitilised kavatsused ja meetmed kujundavad inimarengu tulevikku ja meie planeeti, seistes silmitsi nii enneolematute saavutuste kui ka püsivate väljakutsetega. Tagagem, et 2015. aasta järgne tegevuskava on tõeliselt universaalne ja kaasav ning et lõppeesmärk on maailm, kus kõiki - mehi, naisi, noori ja lapsi - koheldakse võrdselt väärilise objektiivina, mis sobib üldiseks makrotööks, kuid kui soovite suuremat objektiiv-läätse kaugust, annab 100 mm objektiivi teile selle hinnaga.

| How Mobile Games Can Help Improve Sanitation<br/><br/>More than 2.5 billion people, many of them in Africa and South Asia, face grave sanitation challenges. In many of these countries, people are more likely to own a cell phone than a toilet. Therefore there is an obvious opportunity to use mobile technology to promote the use of sanitation and good hygiene in order to make a substantial impact. Mobile phones in Kenya transfer money; Bangladeshis listen to English language classes on their phones; and in Ghana, women entrepreneurs use mobiles to market their wares.<br/><br/>The growing Games for Change industry applies principles of traditional social games to address specific challenges . For example, in the UK, Channel 4 commissioned the game developer Playniac to build an online game to improve financial literacy among the 50% of young Britons who are heavily in debt. In Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, young developers have built iPhone, Android, and Javascript games based on local storylines. Pledge 51, a Nigerian developer group, recently released Danfo, a game where the user plays as a bus driver coping with dense Nigerian traffic.<br/><br/>Hattery Labs has begun to explore how games might improve sanitation practices. The typical game-players in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia are young urban males who own smartphones, but many of the communities that face the greatest sanitation challenges have less advanced technology. However, Javascript games built for Nokia S40 phones (among the most popular handsets in the developing world) provide an opportunity to send a compelling message on good behavior practices in sanitation and hygiene. A full report on how games can promote good sanitation and behavior practice is HERE.<br/><br/>Here are a few game ideas that might prove effective:<br/><br/>Soap Wars makes hand-washing an entertaining challenge where players use the soap dispenser as a weapon against dangerous germs. Sanitation Heroes engages players in the process of sanitation maintenance from capturing, transporting, and disposing of feces to reusing it as fertilizer. It features different scenarios in a memory game that prompts the player to match the solution to each different stage of capturing and treating waste.<br/><br/>Toilet Hunt introduces obstacles along the course of finding a safe place to go to the bathroom. As the player searches for sanitary latrines on a basic map, they must use the clues to decide whether the latrine is safe.<br/><br/>There are outstanding questions that the current research hasn't resolved:<br/><br/>How does the game appeal to illiterate players, who need rich visual descriptions and narratives to guide the gameplay? The need for rich imagery does not necessarily match the small, low-resolution screens of Nokia S40 phones.<br/><br/>How does the game appeal to women, who are critical participants in sanitation but don't represent the largest percentage of mobile game players? One initial idea is to frame sanitation storylines as mobile 'comic books', allowing users to scroll through an interesting narrative with subtle sanitation and hygiene messages.<br/><br/>How can the lessons from the game translate to rural areas, where there are fewer who can access it and more who face the challenges that it seeks to mitigate? Urban users might take their phone with them to their home village and share it with their friends and family, who will begin playing the game and continue to play out the game's storyline in real life.<br/><br/>Finally, how can the game measure its impact on sanitation behavior? User adoption and engagement in this context is a false metric to evaluate impact since users might play the game but have their behavior unchanged. Any solution to measure impact should combine a mobile game with other digital and non-digital applications that help users track their sanitation use alongside their game success. Local developers can work in partnership with games for change experts, community organizations, and telecommunications companies to test these approaches.<br/><br/>This report explores the potential of using mobile games to engage citizens in addressing persistent community challenges but we want to hear from you. Is this an effective way to engage target populations? Are there other ideas for how games can impact behavior change? Would you play these games | Kuidas Mobiilimängud Aitavad Parandada Sanitaartehnikat<br/><br/>Rohkem kui 2,5 miljardit inimest, kellest paljud on Aafrikas ja Lõuna-Aasias, seisavad silmitsi tõsiste sanitaarprobleemidega. Paljudes neist riikidest on inimestel suurem tõenäosus omada mobiiltelefoni kui tualetti. Seetõttu on ilmselge võimalus kasutada mobiilset tehnoloogiat, et edendada sanitaar- ja hea hügieeni kasutamist, et avaldada olulist mõju. Keenias kannavad mobiiltelefonid raha üle, Bangladeshlased kuulavad oma telefonides inglise keele tunde ja Ghanas kasutavad naisettevõtjad oma kaupade turustamiseks mobiiltelefone.<br/><br/>Muutuste mängude kasvav tööstus rakendab traditsiooniliste sotsiaalsete mängude põhimõtteid konkreetsete väljakutsete lahendamiseks. Näiteks Ühendkuningriigis tellis Channel 4 mängu arendaja Playniac ehitada online-mängu, et parandada finantskirjaoskust 50% noorte brittide seas, kes on tugevalt võlgu. Sahara-taguses Aafrikas ja Lõuna-Aasias on noored arendajad ehitanud iPhone'i, Androidi ja Javascripti mänge, mis põhinevad kohalikel lugudel. Pledge 51, Nigeeria arendajagrupp, avaldas hiljuti Danfo, mängu, kus kasutaja mängib bussijuhina, kes tegeleb tiheda Nigeeria liiklusega.<br/><br/>Hattery Labs on hakanud uurima, kuidas mängud võivad parandada sanitaartehnikat. Tüüpilised mängurid Sahara-taguses Aafrikas ja Lõuna-Aasias on noored linnamehed, kellel on nutitelefonid, kuid paljudel kogukondadel, kes seisavad silmitsi kõige suuremate sanitaarprobleemidega, on vähem arenenud tehnoloogia. Kuid Nokia S40 telefonidele ehitatud Javascripti mängud (üks kõige populaarsemaid telefone arengumaades) pakuvad võimalust saata veenev sõnum heade käitumistavade kohta sanitaar- ja hügieenivaldkonnas. Täielik aruanne selle kohta, kuidas mängud võivad edendada head sanitaar- ja käitumispraktikat, on siin.<br/><br/>Siin on mõned mängu ideed, mis võivad osutuda tõhusaks:<br/><br/>Seebisõjad muudavad käsitsi pesemise lõbusaks väljakutseks, kus mängijad kasutavad seebijaoturit relvana ohtlike mikroobide vastu. Sanitatsioonikangelased kaasavad mängijaid sanitaarhoolduse protsessi alates väljaheidete püüdmisest, transportimisest ja kõrvaldamisest väetisena taaskasutamiseks. See sisaldab erinevaid stsenaariume mälumängus, mis palub mängijal lahendust sobitada jäätmete kogumise ja töötlemise erinevate etappidega.<br/><br/>WC Hunt tutvustab takistusi käigus leida ohutu koht minna vannituppa. Kuna mängija otsib sanitaarruumid põhikaardil, peavad nad kasutama vihjeid, et otsustada, kas WC on ohutu.<br/><br/>On lahendamata küsimusi, mida praegused uuringud ei ole lahendanud:<br/><br/>Kuidas meelitab mäng kirjaoskamatuid mängijaid, kes vajavad gameplay suunamiseks rikkalikke visuaalseid kirjeldusi ja narratiive? Rikkalike piltide vajadus ei pruugi tingimata vastata Nokia S40 telefonide väikestele, madala resolutsiooniga ekraanidele.<br/><br/>Kuidas meeldib mäng naistele, kes on sanitaarvaldkonnas kriitilised osalejad, kuid ei esinda suurimat osa mobiilimängude mängijatest? Üks esialgne idee on kujundada sanitaarajalood mobiilseteks "koomiksiteks", mis võimaldavad kasutajatel kerida huvitavat narratiivi peene sanitaar- ja hügieenisõnumitega.<br/><br/>Kuidas saab mängu õppetunnid tõlkida maapiirkondadesse, kus on vähem neid, kes saavad seda kasutada, ja rohkem neid, kes seisavad silmitsi väljakutsetega, mida see püüab leevendada? Linnakasutajad võivad oma telefoni kaasa võtta oma kodukülla ja jagada seda oma sõprade ja perega, kes hakkavad mängu mängima ja jätkavad mängu storyline'i mängimist reaalses elus.<br/><br/>Lõpuks, kuidas saab mäng mõõta selle mõju sanitaarkäitumisele? Kasutajate vastuvõtmine ja kaasamine selles kontekstis on vale mõõdik, et hinnata mõju, kuna kasutajad võivad mängu mängida, kuid nende käitumine ei muutu. Mis tahes lahendus mõju mõõtmiseks peaks ühendama mobiilimängu teiste digitaalsete ja mitte-digitaalsete rakendustega, mis aitavad kasutajatel jälgida oma sanitaarkasutust koos mängu eduga. Kohalikud arendajad saavad nende lähenemisviiside testimiseks teha koostööd muutuste ekspertide, kogukonna organisatsioonide ja telekommunikatsiooniettevõtete mängudega.<br/><br/>Aruandes uuritakse võimalusi, kuidas kasutada mobiilseid mänge, et kaasata kodanikke püsivate ühiskondlike väljakutsetega tegelemisse, kuid me tahame teilt kuulda. Kas see on tõhus viis sihtrühmade kaasamiseks? Kas on muid ideid, kuidas mängud võivad mõjutada käitumise muutusi? Kas sa mängiksid neid mänge |
| Sculpins, form a large family (300 species) of small northern fishes living on the bottom in both marine and fresh waters. Though primarily found in shallow waters, some species occur in depths to 1280 m. Approximately 16 species of sculpins exist from the Canadian Atlantic area. The se raven, longhorn, and shorthorn sculpin are the most popular species found in Newfoundland waters. Also known as gurnets, they are sometimes incorrectly called sea robins, grondin and gurnards, which are close relatives.<br/><br/>Sea Scallops: (Placopecten magellanicus)<br/><br/>Sea Scallops<br/><br/>They are also called giant or smooth scallops, are the most important commercial species of molluscan shellfish in Canada. They have two round shells, (with the commercial shell size ranging from 15 to 20 cm in diameter) nad are cream in color.<br/><br/>Sea scallops are found in the northwest Atlantic from the northern part of the Gulf of St. Lawrence to the coastal waters of North Carolina in the United States. In the northern part of this range, they occur in shallow water (less than 18 m) while in the southern portion, they are found in water deeper than 55 m.<br/><br/>The offshore fishery occurs on Georges Bank off the southwestern tip of Nova Scotia. Depending on the area, scallop fishing can be conducted on a year-round basis.<br/><br/>Sei Whale: (Balaenoptera borealis)<br/><br/>Too big to fit in one photo<br/><br/>14 meters; 13 tons.<br/><br/>The sei whale is often confused with the larger blue and fin whales. Its blow is similar to that of a fin whale, but lower and the sei's dorsal fin is more hooked.<br/><br/>The sei shows little of itself when surfacing, although it may poke its head out of the water, it only arches its back slightly and does not show its flukes before quietly submerging. The sei whale is all one slate gray color on top and may be lighter gray underneath.<br/><br/>Look for several blows in succession as the sei lays on the surface resting between its dives. It may be seen in groups of two to five off Newfoundland.<br/><br/>Shrimp (Pandalus borealis )<br/><br/>The little guy<br/><br/>During the 1990s, carapace length statistics of northern shrimp decreased in commercial and survey catches off Newfoundland and Labrador. Decreased growth rates caused by decreases in per-capita food availability due to large population increases, exacerbated by increased metabolic demands from higher water temperatures in the mid-1990s, appear to be the main cause of the size decrease. Fishing could have had an accelerating effect on environmentally driven decreases in shrimp growth and size by 'cropping' the largest shrimp from the population. The greatest decreases in shrimp size occurred in Hudson Strait and the adjacent northern shelf, the area which also has the highest densities and largest shrimp.<br/><br/>Silver Hake (Merluccius bilinearis)<br/><br/>Silver Hake<br/><br/>Silver Hake (Merluccius bilinearis)<br/><br/>Silver hake are members of the cod family, but are more slender and have two dorsal fins. They are dark gray with silver underparts. When freshly taken from the water, they are silvery iridescent, but the bright colour soon fades. Fish in the catch range from 20 to 30 cm in length and weigh between 0.1 and 0.3 kg.<br/><br/>Occurring from the Grand Banks to South Carolina, silver hake are mainly found on Georges Bank and on the Nova Scotia Banks, particularly on Browns Bank and the Sable Island Banks in depths of 55 to 275 m. Silver hake are generally found in the warmer waters of the Canadian Atlantic (7 to 10° C).<br/><br/>Formerly under-utilized in the Canadian fisheries and harvested mainly by fleets of other nations, silver hake were fished almost exclusively by Canadians using otter trawls in the late 1990s.<br/><br/>Silver Hake is sold in Baltimore as Lake Trout.<br/><br/>Skate (Raja senta) [smooth] (Raja radiata) [thorny]<br/><br/>An unpopular sea creature<br/><br/>The analysis of data for the St. Pierre Bank, which is to the south of Newfoundland, shows the average number of barndoor skate fell from about 0.6 million in the 1950s to fewer than 500 in the 1970s Meanwhile, smaller skate species, namely the horny skate and the smooth skate increased in biomass during the same interval. No barndoor skate have been caught on the St. Pierre Bank since the 1970s.<br/><br/>Smelt (Osmerus mordax)<br/><br/>Tiny Fish for Japan<br/><br/>Native to Newfoundland and Labrador. In the spring the sexually mature ripe smelt will leave either the sea or large lakes and travel up streams to spawn. In Newfoundland this can occur when the ice is still on many of the lakes. However, usually this occurs in March, April or May. The precise time depending on latitude and temperature, usually 8.90C is optimal.<br/><br/>It should be noted that the precise time of spawning is quite specific to the individual stream.<br/><br/>Spawning may last up to three weeks, but the peak seldom lasts more than a week. Spawning takes place at night with spawners returning to the lake or ocean by day . The length of both sexes will decrease in size as the period for spawning progresses. Two males will align themselves on either side of a ripe female. The female releases her eggs in clusters, with the milk of both males being released simultaneously. Eggs become adhesive shortly after extrusion, and attach to bottom gravel.<br/><br/>Snow Crab (Chionoecetes opilio)<br/><br/>Snow Crab<br/><br/>Snow crabs are common in the estuary and the Gulf of St. Lawrence, around Cape Breton Island and in the bays of Newfoundland, from Fortune Bay to White Bay. They are also found near Hamilton Bank off Labrador.<br/><br/>Snow crabs live most commonly on muddy or sand-mud bottoms at temperatures ranging from -0.5 to 4.5°C. In the Gulf of St. Lawrence, they are usually found at depths of 70 to 140 m, while in Cape Breton the depth varies from 45 to 245 m, and 170 to 380 m off Newfoundland. The distribution of small crabs is not well documented but they are occasionally found with the adults, or on gravelly bottoms at shallower depths. In some areas, there are indications that snow crabs move from gravel bottom to mud bottom, usually in deeper waters, as they reach maturity.<br/><br/>Sowerby's Beaked Whale (Mesopolodon bidens)<br/><br/>Where's the sexy lifeguard?<br/><br/>5 meters; 1.5 tons<br/><br/>It is also known as the north sea beaked whale, a rare whale of which little is known. It is thought to be mid-ocean whale which occasionally strays inshore feeding on squid and cod<br/><br/>The majority of whale strandings in the Western north Atlantic have occurred in Newfoundland and Labrador.<br/><br/>The Sowerby's is slate gray on the dorsal side and lighter gray on the ventral region. In adult males two teeth are often seen about one third of the way back on the beak erupted outside the mouth. The beak is around 50 cm long. One onlooker said the head looks like a thermos.<br/><br/>Sperm Whale: (Physeter catadon)<br/><br/>No jokes, please.<br/><br/>13 meters; 28 tons<br/><br/>The largest of the toothed whales is often referred to as "Moby Dick." Located at the front of its head, the single blowhole sends a slanted 5-meter misty spray out 45 degrees from its body. Its massive square head and the series of bumps that replace its dorsal fin easily identify the sperm whale It is slate gray. Sperm whales, like the humpback, will throw their tails high into the air when diving.<br/><br/>They are found offshore hunting for squid in deep water, but occasionally can be seen inshore singly or in small groups. | Skulptuurid moodustavad suure perekonna (300 liiki), mis koosneb väikestest põhjapoolsetest kaladest, kes elavad põhjas nii mere- kui ka magevees. Kuigi neid leidub peamiselt madalates vetes, esinevad mõned liigid 1280 m sügavusel. Kanada Atlandi ookeani piirkonnas on umbes 16 skulptuuriliiki. Newfoundlandi vetes leiduvad kõige populaarsemad liigid on se kaarnad, longhorn ja shorthorn skulptuur. Tuntud ka kui gurnetid, nimetatakse neid mõnikord valesti mere robins, grondin ja gurnards, mis on lähedased sugulased.<br/><br/>merikogerlased: (Placopecten magellanicus)<br/><br/>Merekarplased<br/><br/>Neid nimetatakse ka hiiglaslikeks või siledateks kammkarpideks, need on Kanada kõige olulisemad molluskite kaubanduslikud liigid. Neil on kaks ümmargust kesta (kaubandusliku kesta suurusega 15 kuni 20 cm läbimõõduga) nad on koorevärvilised.<br/><br/>Merikarpe leidub Loode-Atlandil St. Lawrence'i lahe põhjaosast kuni Põhja-Carolina rannikuveteni Ameerika Ühendriikides. Selle vahemiku põhjaosas esineb neid madalas vees (alla 18 m), samas kui lõunaosas leidub neid vees, mis on sügavam kui 55 m.<br/><br/>Avamerepüük toimub Nova Scotia edelaosas Georges Bankis. Sõltuvalt piirkonnast võib kammkarpide püük toimuda aastaringselt.<br/><br/>Sei Whale: (Balaenoptera borealis)<br/><br/>Liiga suur, et mahuks ühte fotosse<br/><br/>14 meetrit, 13 tonni.<br/><br/>Sei vaal on sageli segi aetud suuremate siniste ja uimevaaladega. Selle löök on sarnane uimevaalaga, kuid madalam ja sei seljauim on rohkem konksuga.<br/><br/>Sei näitab pinnale minnes vähe ennast, kuigi ta võib oma pea veest välja tõmmata, vaid kaardub veidi tagasi ja ei näita enne vaikselt sukeldumist oma flööte. Sei vaal on kõik ühe kiltkivi halli värvi peal ja võib olla heledam hall all.<br/><br/>Otsige mitu lööki järjest, kui sei lamab pinnal, mis puhkab sukeldumiste vahel. Seda võib näha kahe kuni viie grupis Newfoundlandist.<br/><br/>Krevetid (Pandalus borealis)<br/><br/>Väike mees<br/><br/>1990. aastatel vähenes põhjapoolsete krevettide kesta pikkus Newfoundlandi ja Labradori rannikul kaubanduslikul ja uuringul. Suuruse vähenemise peamiseks põhjuseks näib olevat 1990. aastate keskpaigas rahvastiku suurest suurenemisest tingitud toidu kättesaadavuse vähenemisest tingitud kasvutempo vähenemine, mida süvendas suurenenud metaboolsed vajadused kõrgemate veetemperatuuride tõttu. Kalapüük oleks võinud kiirendada krevettide kasvu ja suuruse keskkonnasõbralikku vähenemist, nn harides populatsiooni suurimat krevetti. Suurim langus krevettide suuruses toimus Hudsoni väinas ja sellega külgneval põhjapoolsel riiulil, piirkonnas, kus on ka suurim tihedus ja suurim krevetid.<br/><br/>Hõbemerluus (Merluccius bilinearis)<br/><br/>Hõbedane merluus<br/><br/>Hõbemerluus (Merluccius bilinearis)<br/><br/>Hõbedane merluus kuulub tursaperekonda, kuid on õhem ja tal on kaks seljauime. Nad on tumehallid hõbedaste alaosadega. Kui nad on värskelt veest võetud, on nad hõbedased, kuid erksad värvid varsti tuhmuvad. Püügipiirkonna kalad on 20–30 cm pikkused ja kaaluvad 0,1–0,3 kg.<br/><br/>Alates Grand Banks Lõuna-Carolina, hõbe merluusi leidub peamiselt Georges Bank ja Nova Scotia Banks, eriti Browns Bank ja Sable Island Banks sügavusel 55 kuni 275 m. Hõbedast merluusi leidub üldiselt Kanada Atlandi ookeani soojemates vetes (7–10 °C).<br/><br/>Varem Kanada kalapüügis alakasutatud ja peamiselt teiste riikide laevastike poolt püütud hõbedast merluusi püüdsid 1990. aastate lõpus peaaegu eranditult kanadalased, kes kasutasid tursatraale.<br/><br/>Hõbedast merluusi müüakse Baltimore'is Trout Lake'i nime all.<br/><br/>Skate (Raja senta) [sile] (Raja radiata) [thorny]<br/><br/>Ebapopulaarne mereloom<br/><br/>St. Pierre'i panga andmete analüüs, mis asub Newfoundlandi lõunaosas, näitab, et keskmiselt langes barndori rulade arv umbes 0,6 miljonilt 1950. aastatel vähem kui 500-ni 1970. aastatel Samal ajal kasvasid väiksemad rulaliigid, nimelt horny skate ja sile rula biomassis samal perioodil. St. Pierre'i pangas ei ole alates 1970ndatest aastatest püütud ühtegi rulluisu.<br/><br/>Lõhn (Osmerus mordax)<br/><br/>Väike kala Jaapanis<br/><br/>Newfoundlandi ja Labradori põliselanik. Kevadel jätab seksuaalselt küps küpse lõhna kas merest või suurtest järvedest ja reisib üles ojadesse kudema. Newfoundlandis võib see juhtuda, kui jää on veel paljudel järvedel. Kuid tavaliselt toimub see märtsis, aprillis või mais. Täpne aeg sõltuvalt laiuskraadist ja temperatuurist on tavaliselt 8.90C optimaalne.<br/><br/>Tuleb märkida, et kudemise täpne aeg on üsna spetsiifiline individuaalsele voolule.<br/><br/>Kudemine võib kesta kuni kolm nädalat, kuid tipp kestab harva kauem kui nädal. Kudemine toimub öösel, kusjuures kudejad naasevad järvele või ookeanile päeva jooksul . Mõlema soo pikkus väheneb kudemisperioodi edenedes. Kaks isast joonduvad küpse naise mõlemale küljele. Emane vabastab oma munad klastrites, kus mõlema isase piim vabaneb samaaegselt. Munad muutuvad kleepuvaks varsti pärast väljapressimist ja kinnitatakse põhja kruusale.<br/><br/>Lumikrabi (Chionoecetes opilio)<br/><br/>Lumikrabi<br/><br/>Snow krabid on levinud suudmeala ja lahe St. Lawrence, ümber Cape Breton Island ja lahed Newfoundland, Fortune Bay White Bay. Neid leidub ka lähedal Hamilton Bank off Labrador.<br/><br/>Lumekrabid elavad kõige sagedamini mudas või liiva-mudas põhjas temperatuuril vahemikus -0,5 kuni 4,5 ° C. St. Lawrence'i lahes leidub neid tavaliselt 70–140 m sügavusel, samas kui Bretoni neemel varieerub sügavus 45–245 m ja 170–380 m Newfoundlandist. Väikeste krabide levik ei ole hästi dokumenteeritud, kuid neid leidub aeg-ajalt täiskasvanute hulgas või kruusastel põhjadel madalamal sügavusel. Mõnes piirkonnas on märke, et lumekrabid liiguvad kruusa põhjast muda põhja, tavaliselt sügavamates vetes, kui nad jõuavad küpsuseni.<br/><br/>Sowerby's Nokkvaalad (Mesopolodon bidens)<br/><br/>Kus on seksikas elupäästja?<br/><br/>5 meetrit; 1,5 tonni<br/><br/>See on tuntud ka kui Põhjamere nokkvaal, haruldane vaal, millest on vähe teada. Arvatakse, et see on keset ookeani vaal, mis aeg-ajalt eksib kalmaaride ja tursa söötmisel kaldale<br/><br/>Enamik vaalapüügist Põhja-Atlandi lääneosas on toimunud Newfoundlandis ja Labradoris.<br/><br/>Sowerby's on selgroopoolsel küljel kiltkivihall ja kõhupiirkonnas heledam hall. Täiskasvanud meestel on kaks hammast sageli näha umbes kolmandikul noka tagaküljel, mis on väljaspool suud. Nokk on umbes 50 cm pikk. Üks pealtvaataja ütles, et pea näeb välja nagu termos.<br/><br/>Spermavaal: (Physeter catadon)<br/><br/>Ei mingeid nalju, palun.<br/><br/>13 meetrit; 28 tonni<br/><br/>Suurimat hammastatud vaala nimetatakse sageli "Moby Dickiks". Pea esiküljel asuv üks auk saadab kaldus 5-meetrise uduse pihustuse oma kehast 45 kraadi. Selle massiivne ruudukujuline pea ja rida muhke, mis asendavad tema seljauime, tuvastavad kergesti spermavaala. See on kiltkivihall. Spermavaalad, nagu küürvaal, viskavad sukeldumisel oma sabad kõrgele õhku.<br/><br/>Neid leidub avamerel kalmaari küttimisel sügavas vees, kuid aeg-ajalt võib neid näha kaldal eraldi või väikestes rühmades. |
