| Smith Chuck - Through the Bible C2000 SeriesShall we turn to the book of Acts, chapter one, as we begin our study of the early church.<br/>Luke, the author of the book of Acts, a companion of Paul the apostle, who was author also of the Gospel According to Luke, wrote these two treatises to a friend, Theophilus. Theophilus is a Greek name. It's a name that has a beautiful meaning. The name means lover of God. There are some who believe that it was not a man at all, but that the gospel and the book of Acts were addressed to the lovers of God, whoever you may be. There are other traditions that say that Theophilus was actually Luke's master. That in those days physicians were slaves, usually the slave of a wealthy patron. So that Luke's master was Theophilus, and he released Luke to be with Paul on the missionary journeys. Thus, Luke is writing back to his former master. This is an early tradition of the church, but it is, of course, impossible to prove, like so many of the traditions.<br/>There are also those who believe that when Paul was in Troas and he received a vision of a man calling unto him saying, "Come over to Macedonia and help us," that that man in Paul's vision was none other than Luke. For the first one that Paul really met when he came to Macedonia was Luke. And as we are in the book of Acts, you will find that when we get to that portion of the book of Acts, Luke begins to write more in the first person rather than the third person. So it is, evidently, at this particular point in the Acts of the Apostles that Luke became a companion of Paul and began to journey with him. He began to use the pronouns "we" and "us" instead of "they" and "them." This is, no doubt, where Luke became a participant and an eyewitness of those things that were happening from this point on. We will bring this out to you when we get to that point.<br/>He begins the Acts of the Apostles by tying it with the Gospel According to Luke. It is interesting that the very last thing that Luke records in his gospel is the very first thing he records in the Acts of the Apostles. We find the gospel of Luke closing as Jesus is telling His disciples to wait in Jerusalem until they be endued with power from on high. And then Jesus ascended up into heaven, and so he closes the gospel. In opening the Acts of the Apostles, he writes,<br/>The former treatise [that is, the Gospel According to Luke,] have I written unto you, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and teach ( Act 1:1 ),<br/>The key word is began. The Gospel According to Luke is not the full story of the ministry of Jesus Christ. It is only the beginning of the ministry of Jesus Christ. Jesus continues to minister to the needs of people. Jesus continues to heal the sick. Jesus continues to raise the dead. Jesus continues to minister His love and His gospel to the world, only now He is ministering through those disciples who have been anointed with His Holy Spirit. But the ministry of Christ is continuing; basically, is the premise that Luke takes in the Acts of the Apostles. The former treatise of all that Jesus began, both to do and to teach.<br/>Now because of that, the Acts of the Apostles is an unfinished book: in that the Lord today continues to work through the lives of those who have dedicated themselves to be the instruments of God. To be led and guided and anointed by His Holy Spirit, to continue the ministry of Jesus in the world today. Now God has ordained that His work should be accomplished through human instruments. I do not say that it must be accomplished. God can use angelic beings for His work, and there will come a time, during the book of Revelation when God will use angels to proclaim His gospel to people all over the world. Revelation, chapter 14, "The first angel flying through the midst of heaven having the everlasting gospel" ( Rev 14:6 ). But at the present time, God has chosen to use human instruments. As imperfect as they may be, yet that's what God has ordained to use. The exciting thing about that is, God will use me and God will use you. So many times, we're begging off, "O Lord, I can't speak. I've never been able to speak before or even now, Lord." As Moses tried to beg off the call of God. Jeremiah said, "Lord, I'm just a kid; no one's going to listen to me." And we all have our excuses why we can't be used. Don't we? We all know the reasons why God couldn't use us.<br/>One time, as the Lord was calling a prophet to do His work, he said, "Lord, send whoever you want." The Lord said, "Hey, I've called you." "Lord, good idea; send whoever you want." So often we're in that position, "Lord, send by the hand of whomsoever you will, anybody but me Lord." And yet, God has ordained to use us.<br/>Now, each of us can show our own imperfections. Each of us can point out our own inabilities, and all of us can find an excuse why God wouldn't want to use me. But yet, God has chosen to use you. That through your life He might reveal Himself to a needy world. You wonder when God has such instruments to use how He ever got the job done, don't you?<br/>Until the day in which he was taken up, after that he through the Holy Spirit had given commandments to the apostles whom he had chosen ( Act 1:2 ):<br/>That is what he ended the Gospel of Luke with. The day that Jesus was taken up, after He had told the apostles to wait for the endowment of power.<br/>To whom he also [that is the apostles he also] showed himself alive to them after his passion [or death] by many infallible proofs ( Act 1:3 ),<br/>It is difficult to deny the fact of the resurrection of Jesus Christ. I was amused, as well as annoyed and irritated, by an article I read in the Santa Ana Register this last Saturday. Of the creation science and evolutionary theories being presented in the county schools. How that, this one professor said that he teaches a science class, and thus, they deal only in facts, and that they don't have any place for theories. Because science is based upon fact and creation is based upon religious superstitions. It takes a lot of faith to believe the religious theories. When you are dealing with facts, you can just accept them. I thought, "Very interesting in that science class, they taught me it was a fact that the world was four billion years old. Now today they are teaching it's a fact that the world is twelve billion years old. And it wasn't that long ago that I went to school."<br/>It's interesting that the Bible has never needed to be revised or updated to meet the current data that men have discovered. And yet, if you would take my high school science textbooks today and try to teach a science class from them, you would find that many of the things that were taught as scientific fact when I was in high school are no longer recognized as scientific fact. The simple cell protoplasm is no longer a simple cell, but extremely complex. If there is any fact that can be attested to in history it is the fact of the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.<br/>We have a jurisprudence system that is based upon the testimony of witnesses. If a man is accused of a crime and there are people who witnessed that crime while it was being committed, and they are brought to the standard, and they swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help them God. And in their questioning they affirm that, "I saw that man in the bank on May twenty-third. I saw him pull out a gun from his coat. I heard him demand that all of the money be given to him. I saw him as he left the bank. I saw him as the officer apprehended him outside." And if you can get three or four witnesses to point to that man and will keep their testimony under cross-examination, that man is judged to be guilty. He is the one who did it. We have two or three witnesses that are testifying the same story about that man, and it is accepted as fact that he is the one who perpetrated the crime and is guilty. You've got witnesses who have sworn to tell the truth that are verifying.<br/>After the death of Jesus, when He rose again, He appeared unto many different people who gave sworn testimony that they saw Him. That they talked to Him, that He appeared to them in various places under different circumstances. And for a period of forty days was visiting with them. And at one time, up to as many as five hundred people who were gathered at one place, He appeared. It's difficult to just cast aside or deny the witness of these people. To do so is to discredit our whole jurisprudence system. But not only that, these men who testified that they saw the risen Lord, that they talked to Him, that they ate with Him, they, all of them, with the exception of one, met violent deaths at the hands of other people because of their affirming that the story they told was true. You talk about witnesses sworn to tell the truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth. If a person's life was threatened because of that witness, and it was a lie, at least one them would've broken under the pressure. They would've confessed to the entire hoax. "He showed Himself alive after His passion by many infallible proofs."<br/>being seen of them for forty days, speaking to them of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God ( Act 1:3 ):<br/>Sometimes we fault the disciples because of their questions of the timing of the kingdom of God. Let it be remembered that the kingdom of God was the favorite subject of Jesus Christ. He was always talking about the kingdom of God, and it is a great hope that He was planting into the hearts of all men. Things are not always going to continue corrupted as they are. The world is not going to go forever under the power of darkness, under the bondage of evil. God is going to one day establish His kingdom upon the earth. A kingdom of righteous joy and peace. "Jesus shall reign, where ere the sun doth her successive journeys run. And His kingdom will extend from shore to shore." And that day will be the most glorious day the world has ever seen, as sickness and suffering and pain will be abolished in His kingdom. As sin and greed and these things that have made the world such an intolerable place will be abolished in His kingdom. The godless commercialism, the exploitation of man, all of these things abolished in His glorious kingdom when He reigns. No wonder the disciples were anxious to get it on. I'm anxious to get it on; I'm anxious for His kingdom to come. And Jesus told us when we pray, the first petition is, "Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven" ( Mat 6:10 ). This is the right kind of a desire that we should all have. I desire the kingdom of God. And so He was talking to them, during this forty-day period, of the kingdom.<br/>And, being assembled together with them, he commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which, saith he, you have heard of me ( Act 1:4 ).<br/>He said, "Now look, wait here in Jerusalem until you receive the promise of the Father." This promise that He is referring to is, no doubt, the promise in Joel where the Lord promised, "And it shall come to pass in the later days, saith the Lord, that I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and daughters will prophesy, and your young men shall dream dreams, your old men shall see visions: and upon my servants and my handmaidens shall I pour out my Spirit, saith the Lord" ( Joe 2:28-29 ). The promise of the Father: the day is going to come when God is going to pour out His Spirit upon all flesh, all of the believers. They will, each one, receive that dynamic from God.<br/>For John [He said,] truly baptized with water; but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now ( Act 1:5 ).<br/>The idea of baptism was that of emersion, the bapteedzo. John baptized with water, submerged the people in water, "you're going to be submerged in the Holy Spirit in not many days."<br/>Now when they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, will you at this time restore the kingdom to Israel? ( Act 1:6 )<br/>"When is it going to be, Lord? When's the time for this restoration?" And Jesus is talking to them now, not about the kingdom, but about the power that they're going to receive for service. And so He brushes aside their question.<br/>Saying unto them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father has put in his own power ( Act 1:7 ).<br/>"It's not for you to know." They lived constantly in the anticipation of the immediate setting up of the kingdom. During the entire lifetime of Jesus, they were expecting Him at any moment to go into the phone booth and come out as the savior of the world. Shazzam! Showing His power and overthrowing the governments of the world, establishing God's kingdom upon the earth. And they were waiting daily for this change to transpire. And whenever Jesus would talk about going to Jerusalem, being turned over into the hands of sinful man, and then being crucified, "Oh, oh no, Lord. No, no you don't understand the kingdom, Lord. Be that far from Thee." When Jesus died on the cross, they were all greatly disappointed.<br/>The two disciples on the road to Emmaus, so sad. "Hey, fellows. How come you're so sad as your walking along?" "What do you mean? You must be a stranger around here if you don't know the things that have been happening lately in Jerusalem." "What things?" "Oh, a fellow by the name of Jesus of Nazareth...oh man, it was mighty and powerful. The anointing of God was upon His life. We had hoped that in Him was the deliverance of Israel, but they crucified Him. We had hoped . . . now it's dead." Now He's risen, and He's saying, "In a few days, fellows, you're going to receive the promise of the Father." "Oh, what promise? The promise of the establishing of the kingdom?" You see, it was legitimate that they should ask. "Is this it Lord? Alright! Is this the time? Are you going to set up your kingdom now?" "No. It's not for you to know those times that the Father's appointed or that the Father has in His own power. But, you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you."<br/>Now here, the Greek preposition epi is used to signify a new relationship that they were to have with the Holy Spirit. In the Gospel According to John, chapter 14, as Jesus is there promising to send the Holy Spirit, He said, "I will not leave you comfortless. I will come to you, and I will pray the Father, and He will send to you another comforter, even the Spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth Him not neither knows Him, but you know Him for He dwells with you, and He shall be in you" ( Joh 14:17-18 ). Same Greek preposition as ours, only they spell it "en" instead of "in." Two-fold relationship there in John: He is with you, but He's going to be dwelling in you. But now Jesus said you're going to receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you. The Greek preposition epi, which is translated in different texts throughout the New Testament as "upon" or "over" or I like it, "overflows."<br/>In the seventh chapter of the gospel of John: "On the last day, the great day of the feast when Jesus stood there on the Temple Mount and cried to the people, 'If any man thirst let him come unto Me and drink: and he who drinks of the water that I give, out of his innermost being there will gush torrents of living water.'" John said, "This spake He of the Spirit, which was not yet given which they who believe on Him should receive" ( Joh 7:37-39 ). What did He speak of the Spirit? That it would be like a torrent of living water flowing out. I like, "When the Spirit overflows you," upon you, or over you, or overflows from you. So the three-fold relationship: He is with you prior to your conversion, He is the one who causes you to realize that you are a sinner, He is the one who points to Jesus Christ as the answer as He convinces the world of sin, of righteous, and of judgment. The moment you open your life and heart to Jesus Christ and invite Him to come in, the Holy Spirit comes and begins to indwell you. He shall be in you. "Know ye not that you are not your own, you have been bought with a price, therefore glorify God in your body and your spirit which are His. And know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit which is in you? Be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess, but be filled, or be ye being filled with the Spirit" ( 1Co 6:19-20 ,Eph 5:18 ). But now here's a third relationship. This is an empowering experience.<br/>You will receive [the dunamus] the dynamics, when the Holy Spirit has come [epi] upon you [or over you, or when there is that overflow from you]: and ye shall be witnesses unto me ( Act 1:8 )<br/>And so the dynamic, to be a witness for Jesus Christ. It is interesting that the word witness in Greek is the word martus from where we get our word martyr. And in Greek it does mean martyr. A witness is one who not only proclaims what he believes, he lives what he believes, he is what he believes, and he believes it so strongly, that if necessary, he'll die for what he believes. That's how strong is his belief. He's a martus. You can't stop him. He's not afraid to die for what he believes.<br/>You remember when Paul was on his way back to Jerusalem and Agabus came down from Caesarea and he took Paul's girdle and tied himself up and he said, "So is the man who owns this girdle to be bound when he gets to Jerusalem." And Paul's friends began to weep, saying, "Oh, Paul, don't go, don't go." And he said, "What do you mean by these tears? Do you think you're going to dissuade me? Do you think I'm worried about being bound? I'm ready to die." He was a martus. "I'm ready to die." Being put to death for your faith did not make you a martyr; because you were a martyr, you were put to death. Because you were a witness, because you believed it so strong. So, it did not make you a witness, it only proved what you were. You were a witness all along. If you hadn't been a martus, you would've never gone to your death. You would've recanted; you would've said, "Whoa, whoa, wait, wait. Hold on, let's change course here. I think that I may have made a mistake." Then you say, "Well, he wasn't a martus. Stealing a horse doesn't make you a horse thief; it only proves that you were. No one steals a horse unless he's a horse thief. So, stealing it doesn't make you a horse thief, it only proves that you were all along. Being martyred only proves what you were a witness, a martus. "And you will be witnesses." And isn't it interesting that most of them were martyred? "Witnesses unto Me."<br/>The witness was to be both in Jerusalem, and in all of Judea ( Act 1:8 ),<br/>The witness began right at home. The hardest place, isn't it? It's to start right at home in Jerusalem, and then the area around Jerusalem, the area of Judea. And then it was to spread up into Samaria. And then it was to go out into the uttermost parts of the world. And as we study the book of Acts, we will see this very progression. How the witness began in Jerusalem. We'll get that in the next chapter. And then we'll see how it began to spread through out Judea. And then Phillip went up into Samaria, and then finally Paul and Barnabas are called to go into the uttermost parts of the world. And so the witness spread through the anointing and the empowering of the Holy Spirit.<br/>Now when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight ( Act 1:9 ).<br/>This is the final promise made by Jesus to His disciples. This is it, the final words prior to His ascension. Of course, later He came and talked to Paul and others, but prior to His ascension, this is His final word. And upon this, when He had spoken these things, while they were watching Him, He was taken up and a cloud received Him out of their sight.<br/>And while they were looking steadfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, there were two men who stood by them in white apparel ( Act 1:10 );<br/>We assume they were angels.<br/>Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as you have seen him go into heaven ( Act 1:11 ).<br/>They saw Him as He ascended up into heaven and they will behold Him when He comes again. "Behold the Lord cometh with ten thousands of His saints, to execute judgement upon the earth" (Jud 1:14-15). And then, "Unto Him who loved us and gave Himself for us and who has made us unto our God, kings and priests who shall reign with Him upon the earth, behold the Lord cometh, and every eye shall see Him, and they also who pierced Him shall mourn" Rev 1:5-7 ). So the Lord's coming. Every eye shall see Him. The Jehovah Witnesses say that He is already come, but it was a secret coming. As it was only the disciples that saw Him go, it was only the disciples, of the Jehovah Witnesses, who saw Him return. But Jesus said, "If they say unto you, 'He has come in secret and has gone into a secret chamber don't believe it'" ( Mat 24:26 ). So you have to choose, to believe Jesus or them.<br/>"This same Jesus which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as you've seen Him go into heaven."<br/>Now there's a very interesting verse in II John, verse Act 1:7 , "For many deceivers are entered into the world who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh." That, unfortunately, is a poor translation of the Greek. For this participle is in the present tense and should be translated "is coming in the flesh." Those who would deny that Jesus Christ is coming in the flesh. What does John say of them? "They are a deceiver and an antichrist. Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward. For whosoever transgresses and abides not in the doctrine of Christ, has not God. He that abides in the doctrine of Christ, he has both the Father and the Son. And if there come any unto your door (on Saturday morning) and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, and neither bid him good-bye. For he that bids him good-bye is a partaker of his evil deeds" (2Jn 1:7-11). Ask them one question, "Is Jesus coming in the flesh?" Just ask them that question. And if they say no, just remember what John warned you and what John told you. "If any confess not that Jesus Christ is coming in the flesh." Do you remember when He was with the disciples and He said, "Give me something to eat"? He said, "You know, spirits don't eat; touch me. See? It's me." So, this same Jesus is coming again in the same manner in which they saw Him go into heaven. And I, for one, believe that that coming is very soon.<br/>Then retuned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a Sabbath's day journey [about two-thirds of a mile]. And when they were come in, they went up into an upper room, where there abode both Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, and Phillip, and Thomas, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon Zelotes, and Judas the brother of James. And these all continued in one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers ( Act 1:12-14 ).<br/>This is the last mention of Mary the mother of Jesus. At this point and from this point on, there is no further mention of her in the Acts of the Apostles or in the epistles. No mention of her death or of her miraculous ascension into heaven, without death. Nothing is mentioned in the scripture. It is silent.<br/>His brethren would be a reference probably to James and to Jude and to those other brothers who were sons of Joseph and Mary.<br/>The upper room--there are some who say that it is the same upper room in which Jesus had the Last Supper with His disciples. And yet, there are others who hold to this upper room being a room in the temple precincts where the early church met. Take your choice.<br/>And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples, and said, (the number of their names together were about one hundred and twenty,) men and brethren, this Scripture must needs have been fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit by the mouth of David spake before concerning Judas, which was a guide to those who took Jesus ( Act 1:15-16 ).<br/>Here again, Peter still his same impetuous self. They're waiting in prayer and supplication, and Peter stands up and says, "Fellows, there's a scripture that's gotta be fulfilled." And you know he's going to move ahead, "Let's get the program going; let's cast lots and find out who's going to take Judas' place." I do feel that Peter was again in the flesh, manifesting that impetuous nature that was his. And I think that the future history of the church in the book of Acts points this out. I am interested in Peter's understanding of the scriptures, how that he is quoting from so many places in the Old Testament. Peter does manifest a very great understanding of the Old Testament scriptures which is a point in his favor.<br/>Notice that Peter ascribes to the Holy Spirit those things that David wrote. So that, "All scripture is given by inspiration of God" ( 2Ti 3:16 ). Not part of the scriptures. Because, if you tell me that part of the scriptures are given by inspiration of God, then I must ask you, "What parts are by inspiration and what parts are not by inspiration?" And then you are then the authority who tells me what part I can believe and what part I can't believe. And the minute that God is no longer the authority but you're the authority, I'm in trouble. Beware of those who say, "Well, you can't believe all of the scriptures." The scriptures themselves say, "All scripture is given by inspiration of God." And here, Luke in writing of what Peter was saying, declares that David was actually the spokesman for the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit, by the mouth of David, spake concerning Judas.<br/>For he was numbered with us, [he was one of the twelve] he had obtained a part of this ministry. But now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity; and falling headlong ( Act 1:17-18 ),<br/>He purchased the field, the potter's field as Zachariah the eleventh chapter declares.<br/>and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all of his bowels gushed out ( Act 1:18 ).<br/>There are those who find a discrepancy in the scriptures, because in one of the gospels we are told that when Judas came back and tried to return the money, and they said, "Hey, it's your problem. We can't take it." And put it back in the temple treasury. "It's blood money." Then he threw it there on the floor of the temple and he went out and hung himself. Here Peter tells us that he fell headlong and just popped. And there are those who imagine a discrepancy. Very simple, he went up into the tree to hang himself, tied the rope around his neck and tied it to the limb and jumped. And the force of the fall either snapped the rope or his head, and he fell on down into the canyon and just as he said it here.<br/>It was known to all of the dwellers at Jerusalem; insomuch that the field is called in their tongue, Aceldama, that is to say, The field of blood. For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be desolate, and let no man dwell therein: and, His bishoprick let another take ( Act 1:19-20 ).<br/>Now in reality he's quoting from two different Psalms here. From Psa 69:25 ,he puts it together with Psa 109:8 . And putting the two together he finds these prophecies concerning Judas.<br/>Wherefore of these men ( Act 1:21 )<br/>Now here is where they are looking for someone to take Judas' place to be an apostle. Here are the qualifications they looked for in that time.<br/>Wherefore of these men which have companied with us all the time that the Lord Jesus when in and out among us ( Act 1:21 ),<br/>Now you remember there were many disciples, many disciples of which Jesus chose ten to be apostles. And the word apostle means "one who is sent out." Or chose twelve to be apostles, so He sent out the twelve. The number of human government. "We only have eleven. We need one to take Judas' place, but we need one who has been with us all the while from the beginning with Jesus."<br/>From the time he was baptized by John, until the day he was taken up from us, must one be ordained to be a witness [of what?] of His resurrection ( Act 1:22 ).<br/>So these were the requirements they were looking for. Someone who had been around the whole while. From the time of John's baptism to the ascension. And one who saw the risen Lord, and thus could bear fact of the resurrection, their testimony to the fact.<br/>Now Paul the apostle, later in asserting the fact that he was an apostle said, "Have I not seen the risen Christ?" Evidently that was one of the requirements of apostleship. Someone asked me, "Are there apostles today?" Well, I don't know. I don't think that there are in the same sense that they were in the New Testament. Surely there is none today who can bear witness to the resurrection as they did.<br/>They appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias. And they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord, which knowest the hearts of all men, show whether of these two that you have chosen ( Act 1:23-24 ),<br/>I think that we often make this mistake of giving the Lord two choices, both wrong. Limiting God, you see. We're so prone to do this. Obviously, Paul was God's choice. Peter was impetuous, and jumping the gun said, "Hey, we've got to do something, you know, gotta help God out. You know, one's missing and we've got to fill him in." And yet, "God, which one of these two do you want?" And giving God the two choices.<br/>That he may take part of this ministry and this apostleship, from which Judas by the transgression fell, that he might go to his own place. And so they gave forth their lots ( Act 1:25-26 );<br/>An interesting way by which they sought to determine the will of God. Let's throw dice, find out what God's will is here. It's interesting to me, the various ways that people have devised to discern the will of God. Now, in the Old Testament times they had an interesting way of coming to the priest, who would inquire of the Lord for them through the Urim and the Thummim, the "lights and perfections." Just what these Urim and Thummim were, we don't know. I'm sure they were not the colored glasses that Joseph Smith found with the Golden Tablets; the magic glasses, that when you put them on, you could suddenly read the hieroglyphic writing.<br/>There are those who say that the Urim and Thummim were actually a black and a white stone that was worn in a pouch on the chest of the priest. They would pray and ask the Lord a particular question. You remember that David was asking the Lord definite questions: "Lord, shall we go out against the Philistines?" The answer was, "No." So again, the next day, "Lord, shall we go out against the Philistines?" The answer was, "Yes." "When shall we go?" They would ask specific questions, and the Lord would direct them through the Urim and the Thummin. They say that the priest would pray, seek God, and then reach in and pull out one of the two stones. If it was the white stone, it was a yes answer. If it was a no, then it would be the black stone that he would pull out. Some even say we get the term blackballed from this Urim and Thummim. Actually, back in the original it is a no vote against a particular project or idea. Just what the Urim and Thummim were, we don't know. But during the Old Testament period, they did use a method of casting lots to determine the will of God.<br/>So here the disciples are picking up on the same thing as they are throwing the dice to see which of the two fellows that God had chosen to replace Judas Iscariot.<br/>the lot fell on Matthias; he was numbered with the eleven ( Act 1:26 ).<br/>Now who in the world is Matthias? No one ever heard of him before or since. It'll be interesting to meet Matthias and find out who he is and what he did. I think from the subsequent history, it's obvious to assume that God chose Paul as an apostle. Paul declares it himself. Now this is the last time we ever read of them seeking to discern the will of God by the casting of lots or by a chance kind of a thing.<br/>I know a fellow today, in seeking to discern the will of the Lord, will pray and ask the Lord a question. He'll have ten pennies in his pocket, and as he's praying, he'll take the pennies with his eyes closed and put them down on the table, and if they all come up heads, it's a yes. An interesting thing, every once in a while, they'll all come up heads, and that's pretty good odds. Yet, we don't find any pattern for this after the Holy Spirit was given. Once the Holy Spirit came upon the church, then the Holy Spirit began to speak to them and direct them. And the Holy Spirit said, "Separate unto me Paul and Barnabas for the ministry where I have called them" ( Act 13:2 ). And the Holy Spirit sent them forth. So we find the church more directly guided by the Holy Spirit. Once the Holy Spirit came, this throwing dice to find out the will of God was set aside.<br/>"<br/><br/>King James Version<br/><br/>This is the 1769 King James Version of the Holy Bible (also known as the Authorized Version). "Public Domain" | Smith Chuck - Läbi Piibli C2000-seeriaPöördume Apostlite tegude raamatu esimese peatüki poole, kui alustame oma uurimist varajase kiriku kohta.<br/>Luukas, Apostlite tegude raamatu autor, apostel Pauluse kaaslane, kes oli ka evangeeliumi autor Luuka järgi, kirjutas need kaks traktaati sõbrale Theophilus. Theophilus on kreeka nimi. See on nimi, millel on ilus tähendus. Nimi tähendab Jumala armastaja. On mõned, kes usuvad, et see ei olnud inimene üldse, kuid et evangeeliumi ja Apostlite tegude raamat oli suunatud Jumala armastajad, kes iganes sa oled. On ka teisi traditsioone, mis ütlevad, et Theophilus oli tegelikult Luuka isand. Et tolle aja arstid olid orjad, tavaliselt rikka patrooni ori. Nii et Luuka õpetaja oli Theophilus, ja ta vabastas Luuka olla koos Paulusega misjonireisidel. Seega, Luukas kirjutab tagasi oma endisele õpetajale. See on kiriku varajane traditsioon, kuid seda on muidugi võimatu tõestada, nagu paljud traditsioonid.<br/>Mõned usuvad, et kui Paulus oli Troas, nägi ta nägemuses meest, kes temale ütles: „Tule alla Makedooniasse ja aita meid!” Ja et see, keda Paulus nägi nägemuses, ei olnud keegi muu kui Luukas. Sest esimene, et Paulus tõesti kohtus, kui ta tuli Makedoonia oli Luukas. Ja nagu me oleme Apostlite teod, leiad, et kui me saame, et osa Apostlite teod, Luukas hakkab kirjutama rohkem esimeses isikus kui kolmas isik. Nii et see on ilmselt sel konkreetsel hetkel Apostlite tegudes, et Luukas sai Pauluse kaaslaseks ja hakkas temaga reisima. Ta hakkas kasutama asesõnu "meie" ja "meie" asemel "nemad" ja "nemad". See on kahtlemata koht, kus Luukas sai osalejaks ja pealtnägijaks nendele asjadele, mis sellest hetkest alates toimusid. Me toome selle teile välja, kui jõuame selle punktini.<br/>Ta alustab apostlite tegusid, sidudes selle evangeeliumiga vastavalt Luukale. On huvitav, et viimane asi, mida Luukas oma evangeeliumis märgib, on väga esimene asi, mida ta märgib apostlite tegudes. Me leiame evangeeliumi Luuka sulgemise kui Jeesus ütleb oma jüngritele, et oodata Jeruusalemmas, kuni nad on riietatud väega ülalt. Ja siis Jeesus tõusis taevasse, ja nii ta sulgeb evangeeliumi. Avamisel Apostlite tegude, ta kirjutab,<br/>Esimese raamatu ma olen kirjutanud sulle, Teofilos, kõigest sellest, mida Jeesus hakkas tegema ja õpetama.<br/>Võtmesõna on alanud. Evangeelium Vastavalt Luuka ei ole kogu lugu ministeeriumi Jeesuse Kristuse. See on alles algus ministeeriumi Jeesuse Kristuse. Jeesus jätkab teenindavad inimeste vajadusi. Jeesus jätkab tervendada haigeid. Jeesus jätkab oma armastuse ja evangeeliumi teenimist maailmale, alles nüüd teenib Ta nende jüngrite kaudu, kes on võitud Tema Püha Vaimuga. Kuid Kristuse teenimine jätkub; põhimõtteliselt on eeldus, et Luukas võtab Apostlite tegude. Esimene traktaat kõike, mida Jeesus alustas, nii teha ja õpetada.<br/>Seepärast on Apostlite tegude raamat lõpetamata raamat, milles Issand jätkab täna tööd nende elude kaudu, kes on pühendanud end Jumala tööriistadeks. Et juhitakse ja juhitakse ja võitakse Tema Püha Vaimu, et jätkata teenistust Jeesuse maailmas täna. Nüüd Jumal on ordineeritud, et Tema töö tuleb täita läbi inimeste vahendeid. Ma ei ütle, et see peab olema täidetud. Jumal võib oma töös kasutada ingleid ja Ilmutusraamatu ajal tuleb aeg, mil Jumal kasutab ingleid, et kuulutada oma evangeeliumi inimestele üle kogu maailma. Ilmutuse peatükk 14, "Esimene ingel lendas läbi keset taevast, kellel on igavene evangeelium" (Ilm 14:6 ). Aga praegu, Jumal on valinud kasutada inimtööriistad. Nii ebatäiuslik kui nad võivad olla, kuid see on see, mida Jumal on määratud kasutama. Põnev asi, et on, Jumal kasutab mind ja Jumal kasutab sind. Nii palju kordi, me kerjama maha, "Issand, ma ei saa rääkida. Ma ei ole kunagi suutnud rääkida enne või isegi nüüd, Issand." Nagu Mooses püüdis kerjama ära Jumala kutse. Jeremiah ütles: "Issand, ma olen lihtsalt laps; keegi ei kuula mind." Ja meil kõigil on oma vabandused, miks me ei saa kasutada. Kas me ei tea? Me kõik teame põhjuseid, miks Jumal ei saanud meid kasutada.<br/>Kord, kui Issand kutsus prohvetit oma tööd tegema, ütles ta: „Issand, läkita, keda sa tahad!” Ja Issand ütles: „Vaata, ma olen sind kutsunud.” „Issand, hea mõte, läkita, keda sa tahad!” Nii tihti oleme me selles olukorras, "Issand, saada käega, keda iganes sa tahad, keegi peale minu, Issand." Ja ometi, Jumal on käskinud meid kasutada.<br/>Nüüd, igaüks meist saab näidata oma puudusi. Igaüks meist saab osutada oma võimetusi, ja me kõik leiame vabanduse, miks Jumal ei taha kasutada mind. Aga siiski, Jumal on otsustanud kasutada sind. Et läbi oma elu Ta võib ilmutada ennast vaestele maailma. Sa ei tea, kui Jumal on selliseid vahendeid kasutada, kuidas ta kunagi sai töö tehtud, kas pole?<br/>kuni selle päevani, mil Ta võeti üles pärast seda kui Ta Püha Vaimu läbi oli andnud käsu Apostlitele, keda Ta oli valinud,<br/>Sellega lõpetas ta Luuka evangeeliumi. Päeval, mil Jeesus võeti üles, pärast seda, kui Ta oli öelnud apostlitele, et nad ootaksid võimu andmist.<br/>Kellele ka Tema pärast Oma kannatamist on Ennast näidanud elavana mitme eksimatu tõestusmärgi läbi (Apostlite teod 1:3),<br/>Raske on eitada Jeesuse Kristuse ülestõusmise fakti. Mind lõbustas, samuti ärritunud ja ärritunud artikkel, mida lugesin eelmisel laupäeval Santa Ana registris. Loomisteadusest ja evolutsiooniteooriatest, mida esitatakse maakonnakoolides. Kuidas nii, see üks professor ütles, et ta õpetab teadusklassi ja seega tegelevad nad ainult faktidega ja et neil ei ole mingit kohta teooriatele. Kuna teadus põhineb faktidel ja loomine põhineb religioossetel ebauskudel. Usuliste teooriate uskumiseks on vaja palju usku. Faktidega tegeledes saate neid lihtsalt aktsepteerida. Ma mõtlesin: "Väga huvitav selles teadusklassis, nad õpetasid mulle, et see oli fakt, et maailm oli neli miljardit aastat vana. Nüüd nad õpetavad, et see on fakt, et maailm on kaksteist miljardit aastat vana. Ja see ei olnud nii kaua aega tagasi, et ma läksin kooli. "<br/>On huvitav, et Piiblit ei ole kunagi vaja muuta ega ajakohastada, et see vastaks praegustele andmetele, mida inimesed on avastanud. Ja siiski, kui te võtaksite täna minu keskkooli teaduse õpikud ja prooviksite õpetada neilt teadusklassi, leiaksite, et paljusid asju, mida õpetati teaduslike faktidena, kui ma olin keskkoolis, ei tunnustata enam teaduslike faktidena. Lihtne raku protoplasma ei ole enam lihtne rakk, vaid äärmiselt keeruline. Kui on olemas fakt, mida saab ajaloos tõestada, on see Jeesuse Kristuse surnuist ülestõusmine.<br/>Meil on kohtusüsteem, mis põhineb tunnistajate tunnistustel. Kui meest süüdistatakse kuriteos ja on inimesi, kes nägid seda kuritegu, kui see oli toime pandud, ja nad viiakse standardile ja nad vannuvad, et räägivad tõtt, kogu tõde ja mitte midagi muud kui tõde, siis aidaku neid Jumal. Ja nende küsitlemisel kinnitavad nad, et: "Ma nägin seda meest pangas kahekümne kolmandal mail. Ma nägin, et ta tõmbas oma mantlist relva välja. Ma kuulsin teda nõudma, et kõik raha talle antaks. Ma nägin teda, kui ta pangast lahkus. Ja kui sa temale annad kolm või neli tunnistajat, kes teda tunnistavad, ja pead tema üle kohut; siis on ta kohtumõistja seest, kes seda on teinud. Meil on kaks või kolm tunnistajat, kes tunnistavad sama lugu selle mehe kohta, ja see on aktsepteeritud faktina, et ta on see, kes pani toime kuriteo ja on süüdi. Teil on tunnistajad, kes on vandunud rääkida tõde, et nad kontrollivad.<br/>Pärast Jeesuse surma ilmus Ta pärast seda, kui Ta oli üles tõusnud, paljudele inimestele, kes vandega tunnistasid, et nad olid Teda näinud ja Temaga rääkinud ja et Ta oli neile ilmunud erinevates paigus ja erinevates olukordades. Ja nelikümmend päeva ta külastas neid. Ja korraga, kuni viissada inimest, kes olid kogunenud ühte kohta, Ta ilmus. Raske on lihtsalt kõrvale heita või eitada tunnistust need inimesed. See tähendab kogu meie õigussüsteemi diskrediteerimist. Kuid mitte ainult seda, et need mehed, kes tunnistasid, et nad nägid ülestõusnud Issandat, et nad rääkisid Temaga, et nad sõid koos Temaga, nad kõik, välja arvatud üks, kogesid vägivaldset surma teiste inimeste kätes, sest nad kinnitasid, et lugu, mida nad rääkisid, oli tõsi. Te räägite tunnistajatest, kes vandusid rääkida tõtt, kogu tõde, ainult tõde. Kui inimese elu oleks selle tunnistaja pärast ohus ja see oleks vale, oleks vähemalt üks neist surve all murdunud. Nad oleksid tunnistanud kogu pettuse. "Ta näitas ennast elus pärast oma kirge paljude eksimatute tõenditega."<br/>neile ilmunud nelikümmend päeva, rääkides neile Jumala riigist;<br/>Mõnikord me süüdistada jüngrid, sest nende küsimused ajastus Jumala kuningriiki. Tuleb meeles pidada, et Jumala kuningriik oli lemmik teema Jeesus Kristus. Ta rääkis alati Jumala kuningriigist ja see on suur lootus, et Ta istutas kõigi inimeste südamed. Asjad ei jää alati rikutud nagu nad on. Maailm ei lähe igavesti pimeduse võimu alla, kurja orjuse alla. Jumal kavatseb ühel päeval rajada oma kuningriigi maa peal. Õiglase rõõmu ja rahu kuningriik. "Jeesus valitseb seal, kus päike jookseb, ja tema kuningriik ulatub kaldast kaldani." Ja see päev saab olema kõige hiilgavam päev, mida maailm eales näinud on, kui haigused, kannatused ja valud kaotatakse Tema kuningriigis. Nagu patt ja ahnus ja need asjad, mis on teinud maailma selliseks talumatuks kohaks, kaotatakse Tema kuningriigis. Jumalatu kommertsialism, ekspluateerimine inimese, kõik need asjad kaotati Tema hiilgav kuningriik, kui Ta valitseb. Pole ime, et jüngrid olid mures, et saada see. Ma olen mures, et saada see; Ma olen mures, et Tema kuningriik tuleb. Ja Jeesus ütles meile, kui me palvetame, esimene palve on: "Sinu riik tulgu. Sinu tahtmine sündigu nagu taevas, nii ka maa peal" (Matt 6:10 ). See on õige soov, et meil kõigil peaks olema. Ma tahan Jumala riiki. Ja ta rääkis neile selle neljakümne päeva jooksul kuningriigist.<br/>Ja kui Ta nendega koos oli, keelas Ta neid Jeruusalemmast ära minemast, käskis aga oodata Isa tõotust, „mis teie,” ütles Tema, „on Minust kuulnud” (Ap 1:4).<br/>Ja ta ütles neile: „Vaata, siin Jeruusalemmas oota, kuni sa saad Isa tõotuse!” See tõotus, millele Ta viitab, on kahtlemata Joeli tõotus, kus Issand tõotab: „Ja viimseil päevil, ütleb Issand, sünnib, et ma valan välja oma Vaimu kõige liha peale; ja teie pojad ja tütred ennustavad ja teie noored mehed näevad unenägusid, teie vanemad näevad nägemusi, ja oma sulaste ja teenijate peale ma valan välja oma Vaimu, ütleb Issand. Isa tõotus: päev tuleb, mil Jumal läheb valada oma Vaimu üle kogu liha, kõik usklikud. Nad, igaüks, saavad, et dünaamika Jumalalt.<br/>Sest Johannes ristis küll veega, aga teid ristitakse Püha Vaimuga mitte kaua pärast neid päevi (Ap 1:5).<br/>Idee ristimine oli, et emersion, baptisteedzo. Johannes ristitud veega, kastetud inimesed vees, "sa lähed sukelduda Püha Vaimu ei ole palju päevi."<br/>Kui need nüüd kokku tulid, küsisid nad Temalt ning ütlesid: „Issand, kas sa sel ajal jälle ehitad Iisraelile kuningriigi?”<br/>"Millal see saab olema, Issand? Millal on aeg selle taastamise?" Ja Jeesus räägib neile nüüd, ei ole umbes kuningriiki, kuid võimu, et nad saavad teenuse. Ja nii Ta harjab kõrvale oma küsimusele.<br/>Ja Ta ütles neile: „Teil ei ole tarvis teada aegu ega hetki, mis Isa Omas meelevallas on määranud” (Ap 1:7).<br/>"See ei ole sinu teada." Nad elasid pidevalt ootuses kohene loomine kuningriigi. Kogu Jeesuse elu, nad ootasid Teda igal hetkel minna telefoni kabiini ja tulla välja maailma päästja. Shazzam! Näidates oma võimu ja kukutada maailma valitsused, rajades Jumala kuningriigi maa peal. Ja nad ootasid iga päev selle muutuse toimumist. Ja iga kord, kui Jeesus tahtis rääkida Jeruusalemma minekust, et ta antakse patuse inimese kätte ja seejärel risti lüüa, ütles ta: „Oo, ei, Issand. Ei, ei, sina ei mõista kuningriiki, Issand. Ole nii kaugel sinust.” Kui Jeesus ristil suri, olid nad kõik väga pettunud.<br/>Kaks jüngrit teel Emmaus, nii kurb. "Hei, poisid. Miks sa oled nii kurb kui oma kõndides?" "Mida sa mõtled? Sa pead olema võõras siin, kui sa ei tea asju, mis on juhtunud viimasel ajal Jeruusalemmas." "Mis asjad?" "Oh, mees nimega Jeesus Naatsaretlane... oh inimene, see oli vägev ja vägev. Jumala võidmine oli Tema elu. Me olime lootnud, et Temas oli Iisraeli vabastamine, kuid nad lõid Ta risti. Me olime lootnud . . . nüüd on ta surnud." Nüüd Ta on üles tõusnud, ja Ta ütleb: "Mõne päeva pärast, poisid, te saate Isa tõotuse." "Oh, mis tõotus? Lubadus kuningriigi rajamiseks?" Näete, see oli õigustatud, et nad peaksid küsima. "Kas see on Issand? Olgu! Kas see on aeg? Kas sa kavatsed rajada oma kuningriigi nüüd? "Ei. See ei ole teile teada, et aeg, et Isa on määratud või et Isa on oma võimu, kuid, saate võimu, kui Püha Vaim tuleb teie peale. "<br/>Siin kasutatakse kreekakeelset eessõna epi, et tähistada uut suhet, mis neil pidi olema Püha Vaimuga. Evangeeliumis vastavalt Johannese 14. peatükile, kui Jeesus lubab Püha Vaimu saata, ütles Ta: "Ma ei jäta teid ebamugavaks. Ja mina tulen teie juurde ja palun Isa, ja tema läkitab teie juurde teise trööstija, tõe Vaimu, keda maailm ei saa vastu võtta, sest ta ei näe teda ega tunne teda, aga teie tunnete teda, sest ta elab koos teiega ja tema jääb teisse” (Jh 14:17-18). Sama kreeka preposition nagu meie, ainult nad kirjutavad seda "en" asemel "in". Kahekordne suhe seal Johannes: Ta on sinuga, kuid ta elab sinus. Aga nüüd Jeesus ütles, et sa lähed, et saada jõudu, kui Püha Vaim tuleb teie peale. Kreeka eessõna epi, mis on tõlgitud erinevates tekstides kogu Uues Testamendis kui "üle" või "üle" või mulle meeldib see, "ülevool".<br/>Johannese evangeeliumi seitsmendas peatükis: "Viimsel päeval, suurel pühapäeval, kui Jeesus seisis pühakoja mäel ja hüüdis rahvale: "Kui kellelgi on janu, tulgu minu juurde ja joogu, ja kes iganes joob vett, mida mina annan, see voolab oma sisimast välja elava vee ojad." Johannes ütles: "Seda Ta rääkis Vaimust, mida ei olnud veel antud neile, kes Temasse usuvad, et nad saaksid" (Jh 7:37-39). Mida Ta rääkis Vaimust? et see oleks nagu elava vee voolamine. Mulle meeldib: "Kui Vaim voolab üle sinu," teie peale või üle teie, või voolab üle teie. Nii kolmekordne suhe: Ta on teiega enne teie pöördumist, Ta on see, kes paneb teid mõistma, et olete patune, Ta on see, kes osutab Jeesusele Kristusele vastusena, kui ta veenab maailma patust, õigemeelsusest ja kohtumõistmisest. Hetkest, mil sa avad oma elu ja südame Jeesusele Kristusele ja kutsud Teda sisenema, tuleb Püha Vaim ja hakkab sinus elama. Ta on sinu sees. Eks te tea, et te olete kalli hinnaga ostetud oma varandusega, et te austaksite Jumalat omas ihus ja oma vaimus? Eks te tea, et teie ihu on Püha Vaimu tempel, Kes on teie sees? Ärge joobuge viinast, milles on liig, vaid saage täis, või täituge Vaimuga" (1Kr 6:19-20; Ef 5:18). Aga nüüd on kolmas suhe. See on võimendav kogemus.<br/>Te saate dünaamika, kui Püha Vaim tuleb teie peale või kui see teie juurest voolab välja, ja te peate olema minu tunnistajad (Ap 1:8).<br/>Ja nii dünaamiline, olla tunnistaja Jeesuse Kristuse. On huvitav, et sõna tunnistus kreeka on sõna martus kust me saame meie sõna märter. Ja kreeka keeles see tähendab märter. Tunnistaja on see, kes mitte ainult ei kuuluta seda, mida ta usub, ta elab seda, mida ta usub, ta on see, mida ta usub, ja ta usub seda nii tugevalt, et kui vaja, ta sureb selle eest, mida ta usub. See on, kui tugev on tema usk. Ta on martus. Sa ei saa teda peatada, ta ei karda surra selle eest, mida ta usub.<br/>Te mäletate ju, kuidas Paulus oli teel tagasi Jeruusalemma ja kuidas Agabus Kaisareast alla tuli, võttis Pauluse vöö ja sidus end siduma ning ütles: „Nõnda peab ka see, kellel on see vöö, kinni siduma, kui ta Jeruusalemma jõuab!” Ja Pauluse sõbrad hakkasid nutma, öeldes: "Oh, Paul, ära mine, ära mine." Ja ta ütles: "Mida sa mõtled nende pisarate all? Kas sa arvad, et sa kavatsed mind veenda? Kas sa arvad, et ma olen mures seotud olemise pärast? Ma olen valmis surema." Ta oli martus. Sest ma olen valmis surema. Teie usu pärast ei tehtud teid märtriks, vaid teid tapeti, sellepärast et te olite märtriks; ja teie olite tunnistajaks, et te uskusite vägevalt. Nii et see ei teinud sinust tunnistajat, see ainult tõestas, kes sa oled. Sa olid tunnistaja kogu aeg. Kui sa poleks olnud Martus, siis sa poleks kunagi läinud oma surma. Sa oleksid tagasi lükanud; sa oleksid öelnud: "Vau, vau, oota, oota. Oota, vahetame kurssi. Ma arvan, et ma tegin vea." Siis sa ütled: "Noh, ta ei olnud martus. Hobuse varastamine ei tee sind hobuse vargaks; see ainult tõestab, et sa olid. Keegi ei varasta hobust, kui ta pole hobuse varas. Nii et selle varastamine ei tee sind hobuse vargaks, see ainult tõestab, et sa olid kogu aeg. Märtris olemine tõestab ainult seda, mida sa olid tunnistaja, martus. "Ja sa saad tunnistajaks." Ja kas pole huvitav, et enamik neist olid märtrisurma? "Tunnistajad mulle."<br/>Ja see pidi olema tunnistajaks nii Jeruusalemmas kui ka kogu Juudamaal (Apostlite teod 1:8).<br/>Tunnistaja algas otse kodus. Kõige raskem koht, kas pole? See on alustada otse kodus Jeruusalemmas, ja siis ümbruses Jeruusalemma, ala Juudamaa. Ja siis oli levinud Samaaria. Ja siis oli see minna maailma äärmustesse. Ja kui me uurime Apostlite tegude raamatut, näeme seda väga progresseerumist. Kuidas tunnistus algas Jeruusalemmas. Me saame selle järgmises peatükis. Ja siis me näeme, kuidas see hakkas levima kogu Juudamaal. Ja siis Filippus läks Samaariasse, ja siis lõpuks Paulus ja Barnabas kutsutakse minna maailma äärteni. Ja nõnda levis tunnistus läbi võidmise ja Püha Vaimu väe kaudu.<br/>Kui Ta seda oli öelnud, siis tõsteti Ta üles nende nähes ja pilv viis Ta nende silme eest ära.<br/>See on viimane lubadus, mille Jeesus tegi oma jüngritele. See on see, viimased sõnad enne Tema ülestõusmist. Muidugi, hiljem Ta tuli ja rääkis Pauluse ja teised, kuid enne Tema ülestõusmist, see on Tema viimane sõna. Kui Ta seda oli öelnud, siis tõsteti Ta üles nende nähes ja pilv viis Ta nende silme eest ära.<br/>Ja kui nad vaatasid üksisilmi taeva poole, kuidas Ta ära läks, vaata, siis seisid nende juures kaks meest valgeis riideis,<br/>Me eeldame, et nad olid inglid.<br/>ning ütlesid: „Galilea mehed, miks te seisate ja vaatate üles taeva poole? See Jeesus, Kes teilt üles võeti taevasse, tuleb samal kombel kui te nägite Teda taevasse minevat!”<br/>Nad nägid Teda, kui Ta tõusis taevasse, ja nad näevad Teda, kui Ta tuleb jälle. "Vaata, Issand tuleb kümne tuhande Tema pühadega, et mõista kohut maa peal" (Juuda 1:14-15). Ja siis, Tema juurde, kes armastas meid ja andis Iseenese meie eest ja kes meid on teinud kuningateks ja preestriteks, kes ühes Temaga valitsevad maa peal, vaata, Issand tuleb ja kõik silmad saavad Teda näha, ja need, kes Tema läbi pistsid, peavad nutma (Ilm 1:5-7). Nii Issand tuleb. Iga silm näeb Teda. Jehoova tunnistajad ütlevad, et Ta on juba tulnud, kuid see oli salajane tulek. Kuna see oli ainult jüngrid, kes nägid Teda minna, see oli ainult jüngrid, Jehoova tunnistajad, kes nägid Teda tagasi. Aga Jeesus ütles: „Kui nad ütlevad teile: Ta on tulnud salaja ja on läinud salajasse kambrisse, siis ärge uskuge” (Mt 24:26).<br/>See Jeesus, kes teilt üles võeti taevasse, tuleb nõnda nagu te nägite Teda taevasse minevat.<br/>Nüüd on väga huvitav salm II Johannese, salm Apostlite 1:7 : "Sest paljud petturid on tulnud maailma, kes ei tunnista, et Jeesus Kristus on tulnud liha." See on kahjuks halb tõlge kreeka. Sest see osalus on praegu pingeline ja tuleks tõlkida "on tulemas liha." Need, kes eitaksid, et Jeesus Kristus on tulemas liha. Mida Johannes ütleb neist? "Nad on pettur ja antikristus. Vaadake, et te ei mineta seda, mis me oleme vaevaga saavutanud, vaid et te saaksite kätte täie palga. Sest kellel iganes on üleastumine ja kes ei püsi Kristuse õpetuses, sellel ei ole Jumalat. Kes püsib Kristuse õpetuses, sellel on nii Isa kui Poeg. Ja kui keegi tuleb teie ukse juurde (laupäeva hommikul) ja ei too seda õpetust, ärge võtke teda oma majasse ega hüvasti. Sest see, kes ütleb talle hüvasti on osa tema kurjade tegude" (2Jh 1:7-11). Küsi neilt üks küsimus: "Kas Jeesus tuleb liha?" Lihtsalt küsi neilt seda küsimust. Ja kui nad ütlevad ei, lihtsalt meeles pidada, mida Johannes hoiatas teid ja mida Johannes ütles teile. "Kui keegi ei tunnista, et Jeesus Kristus on tulnud lihasse." Kas sa mäletad, kui ta oli koos jüngritega ja ütles: "Andke mulle midagi süüa?" Ta ütles: "Tead, vaimud ei söö; puuduta mind. Vaata, see olen mina." Niisiis, see sama Jeesus tuleb uuesti, nii nagu nad nägid teda minna taevasse. Ja ma, üks, ma usun, et see tuleb varsti.<br/>Siis nad läksid tagasi Jeruusalemma mäelt, mida kutsutakse Õlimäeks ja mis on Jeruusalemmast ühe hingamispäeva teekonna maad. Ja kui nad olid jõudnud linna, siis nad läksid ülemisse tuppa, kus nad olid asumas, Peetrus ja Jakoobus ja Johannes ja Andreas, Filippus ja Toomas, Bartolomeus ja Matteus, Jakoobus, Alfeuse poeg ja Siimon Selootes ja Juudas, Jakoobuse vend. Ja need kõik olid alati ühel meelel üheskoos palves naistega ja Maarjaga, Jeesuse Emaga, ja Jeesuse vendadega (Apostlite teod 1:12-14).<br/>See on Jeesuse ema Maarja viimane mainimine. Selles punktis ja sellest hetkest alates ei mainita teda enam Apostlite tegudes ega kirjades. Ei mainita tema surma ega tema imelist ülestõusmist taevasse, ilma surmata. Pühakirjas pole midagi mainitud. See on vaikne.<br/>Tema vennad viitasid arvatavasti Jaakobusele ja Juudale ning neile teistele vendadele, kes olid Joosepi ja Maarja pojad.<br/>Ülemine tuba - on mõned, kes ütlevad, et see on sama ülemine tuba, kus Jeesus oli viimane õhtusöök koos oma jüngritega. Ja veel, on teisi, kes hoiavad seda ülemist tuba, mis on ruum templis, kus varajane kirik kohtus. Tee oma valik.<br/>Neil päevil tõusis Peetrus isekeskis ja ütles: „Mehed, vennad, kui palju nimesid oli kokku, umbes sada kakskümmend, siis pidi täide minema Kirjasõna, mis Püha Vaim on ette kuulutanud Taaveti suu kaudu Juuda kohta, kes hakkas teejuhiks Jeesuse kinnivõtjaile” (Apostlite teod 1:15–16).<br/>Siin jällegi, Peetrus on ikka veel sama innukas mina. Nad ootavad palves ja anumises, ja Peetrus tõuseb üles ja ütleb: "Mehed, seal on pühakiri, mis peab täide minema." Ja sa tead, et ta läheb edasi, "Lähme programm käima; heitke liisku ja teada saada, kes läheb võtma Juudas koht." Ma tunnen, et Peetrus oli jälle lihalik, manifesteerides, et tormakas olemus, mis oli tema. Ja ma arvan, et kiriku tuleviku ajalugu Apostlite tegude raamatus juhib tähelepanu sellele. Ma olen huvitatud Peetruse arusaamist pühakirjadest, kuidas ta tsiteerib nii paljudest kohtadest Vanas Testamendis. Peetrus väljendab väga suurt arusaamist Vana Testamendi pühakirjadest, mis on punkt tema kasuks.<br/>Pange tähele, et Peetrus omistab Pühale Vaimule seda, mida Taavet kirjutas. Nii et "kõik kiri on antud Jumala inspireeritud" ( 2Ti 3:16 ). See ei ole osa pühakirjadest. Sest kui sa ütled mulle, et osa pühakirjadest on Jumala inspireeritud, siis ma pean sinult küsima: "Millised osad on inspireeritud ja millised mitte?" Ja siis oled sina see autoriteet, kes ütleb mulle, millist osa ma võin uskuda ja mida ma ei saa uskuda, ja hetkest, kui Jumal ei ole enam autoriteet, vaid sina oled autoriteet, olen ma hädas. Hoiduge nende eest, kes ütlevad: „Te ei või uskuda kõiki Kirju!” Kiri ise ütleb: „Kõik Kiri on Jumala Vaimu poolt antud.” Ja siin, Luukas kirjutab, mida Peetrus ütles, kuulutab, et Taavet oli tegelikult eestkõneleja Püha Vaimu. Püha Vaim on rääkinud, et Taaveti suu kaudu Juudas.<br/>Sest ta oli arvatud meie sekka ja oli saanud selle ameti osaliseks, kui ta nüüd oli ostnud põllu ülekohtu palgaga, ja peagi ta langes (Apostlite teod 1:17-18).<br/>Ta ostis välja, pottsepapõllu, nagu Sakarias üheteistkümnendas peatükis ütleb.<br/>Ja ta langes pea peale ja murdis ta keskpaigast, ja kõik ta sisikond voolas välja (Apostlite teod 1:18).<br/>On neid, kes leiavad lahknevuse pühakirjades, sest ühes evangeeliumides öeldakse meile, et kui Juudas tuli tagasi ja püüdis raha tagasi anda, ja nad ütlesid: "Hei, see on teie probleem. Me ei saa seda võtta." Ja pane see tagasi templi varakambrisse. "See on vere raha." Siis ta viskas selle sinna templi põrandale ja ta läks välja ja rippus ise. Siin Peetrus ütleb meile, et ta kukkus peaga ja lihtsalt hüppas. Ja on neid, kes kujutavad ette lahknevust. Väga lihtne, ta läks puu otsa, et ennast üles riputada, sidus köie kaela ümber ja sidus selle jäseme külge ja hüppas. Ja kukkumise jõud lõi köie või tema pea, ja ta kukkus alla kanjonisse ja just nii, nagu ta siin ütles.<br/>Ja see sai teatavaks kõigile Jeruusalemma elanikele, nõnda et põldu nende oma keelemurdes hüütakse Akeldaamaks, see on Verepõlluks. Sest Psalmide raamatus on kirjutatud: "Tema elamu saagu tühjaks ja ärgu ükski elagu selles!" ja: "Tema vürst võtku teine" (Ap 1:19-20).<br/>Nüüd tegelikult ta tsiteerib kaks erinevat Psalmid siin. Alates Ps 69:25 ,Ta paneb selle koos Ps 109:8 . Ja pannes need kaks kokku ta leiab need ettekuulutused seoses Juudas.<br/>Seepärast need mehed (Apostlite teod 1:21).<br/>Siin on koht, kus nad otsivad kedagi, kes võtaks Juuda koha apostliks. Siin on kvalifikatsioonid, mida nad sel ajal otsisid.<br/>Sellepärast olgu nüüd üks neist meestest, kes on käinud ühes meiega kõige selle aja, mil Issand Jeesus meie juures käis sisse ja välja,<br/>Nüüd sa mäletad, seal oli palju jüngreid, paljud jüngrid, kelle Jeesus valis kümme olla apostlid. Ja sõna apostel tähendab "üks, kes on läkitatud." Või valis kaksteist olla apostlid, nii Ta saatis kaksteist. Arv inimese valitsus. "Meil on ainult üksteist. Meil on vaja üks, et võtta Juudas koht, kuid me vajame üks, kes on olnud meiega algusest peale Jeesusega."<br/>Alates sellest, kui Johannes ta ristis, kuni päevani, mil ta võeti üles meie juurest, peab üks olema seatud tunnistama tema ülestõusmist (Apostlite teod 1:22).<br/>Nii et need olid nõuded, mida nad otsisid. Keegi, kes oli olnud umbes kogu aeg. Alates ajast Johannese ristimisest kuni taevasseminekuni. Ja see, kes nägi ülestõusnud Issandat, ja nii võis kanda fakti ülestõusmise, nende tunnistust asjaolu.<br/>Nüüd apostel Paulus, hiljem kinnitades asjaolu, et ta oli apostel, ütles: "Kas ma ei näinud ülestõusnud Kristust?" Ilmselt oli see üks apostliameti nõudeid. Keegi küsis minult: "Kas apostlid on täna?" Noh, ma ei tea. Ma ei usu, et seal on samas mõttes, et nad olid Uues Testamendis. Kindlasti ei ole täna keegi, kes saab tunnistada ülestõusmist nagu nad tegid.<br/>Ja nad määrasid kaks meest: Joosepi, keda hüütakse Barsabaseks, lisanimega Justuseks, ja Mattiase, ja need palvetasid ning ütlesid: „Sina, Issand, kõikide südametundja, näita meile, kumma neist kahest Sina oled valinud,<br/>Ma arvan, et me teeme sageli selle vea, andes Issandale kaks valikut, mõlemad valed. Piirates Jumalat, näete. Me oleme nii altid seda tegema. Ilmselgelt, Paulus oli Jumala valik. Peter oli innukas ja hüppas relvast ja ütles: "Hei, me peame midagi tegema, sa tead, me peame Jumalat aitama. Tead, üks on kadunud ja me peame ta täitma." Ja siiski, "Jumal, kumba neist kahest sa tahad?" Ja andes Jumalale kaks valikut.<br/>et ta saaks osa sellest teenistusest ja apostliametist, millest Juudas ära langes üleastumise läbi, et ta läheks oma paika. Ja nõnda nad andsid oma loosi ( Apostlite teod 1:25-26 )<br/>Huvitav viis, kuidas nad püüdsid määrata Jumala tahet. Viskame täringuid, teada saada, mida Jumala tahe on siin. See on huvitav mulle, erinevaid viise, et inimesed on välja töötanud, et eristada Jumala tahet. Nüüd, Vana Testamendi aegadel oli neil huvitav viis tulla preestri juurde, kes küsis Issandalt nende eest läbi Uurimi ja Tummimi, "valguse ja täiuslikkuse". Lihtsalt, mis need Urim ja Tummim olid, me ei tea. Ma olen kindel, et need ei olnud värvilised prillid, mis Joseph Smith leidis koos kuldsete tahvlitega; maagilised prillid, et kui te neid kannate, võite äkki lugeda hieroglüüfilist kirjutamist.<br/>On neid, kes ütlevad, et Uurim ja Tummim olid tegelikult must ja valge kivi, mida kanti preestri rinnal olevas kotis. Nad palvetasid ja küsisid Issandalt konkreetse küsimuse. Kas sa mäletad, et Taavet küsis Issandalt kindlaid küsimusi: "Issand, kas me läheme välja vilistide vastu?" Vastus oli: "Ei." Järgmisel päeval jälle, "Issand, kas me läheme välja vilistide vastu?" Vastus oli: "Jah." "Millal me läheme?" Nad küsiksid konkreetseid küsimusi ja Issand suunaks neid läbi Urimi ja Thummini. Nad ütlevad, et preester palvetaks, otsiks Jumalat ja seejärel haaraks ja tõmbaks ühe kahest kivist. Kui see oli valge kivi, oli see jah vastus. Kui see oleks eitav, siis oleks see must kivi, mida ta tõmbaks. Mõned isegi ütlevad, et me saame termini mustaks sellest Urimist ja Thummimist. Tegelikult on originaalis see eitav hääletus konkreetse projekti või idee vastu. Me ei tea, mis olid Uurim ja Tummim, kuid Vana Testamendi perioodil kasutasid nad Jumala tahte määramiseks loosimise meetodit.<br/>Nii et siin korjavad jüngrid üles sama asja, kui nad viskavad täringut, et näha, kumb kahest kaaslasest, kelle Jumal oli valinud Juudas Iskarioti asemele.<br/>liisuheitmine langes Mattiase peale; ta loeti üheteistkümne hulka (Apostlite teod 1:26).<br/>Nüüd, kes maailmas on Matthias? Keegi pole temast kunagi varem või pärast seda kuulnud. Huvitav on kohtuda Matthiasega ja teada saada, kes ta on ja mida ta tegi. Ma arvan, et järgnevast ajaloost on ilmne, et Jumal valis Pauluse apostliks. Paulus kuulutab seda ise. Nüüd on see viimane kord, kui me loeme neist, kes püüavad mõista Jumala tahet loosimise või juhusliku asja kaudu.<br/>Ma tean täna, et üks kaaslane, kes püüab mõista Issanda tahet, palvetab ja esitab Issandale küsimuse. Tal on taskus kümme penni, ja kui ta palvetab, võtab ta pennid silmad kinni ja paneb need lauale, ja kui nad kõik tulevad peaga, on see jah. Huvitav on see, et aeg-ajalt tulevad nad kõik pähe ja see on päris hea võimalus. Ometi ei leia me pärast Püha Vaimu andmist selle jaoks mingit mustrit. Kui Püha Vaim tuli koguduse peale, siis Püha Vaim hakkas nendega rääkima ja neid juhtima, öeldes: „Eraldage mulle Paulus ja Barnabas teenistusse, kuhu ma nad olen kutsunud!” (Ap. t. 13:2 ). Ja Püha Vaim saatis neid välja. Nii leiame kiriku otsesemalt juhindub Püha Vaim. Kui Püha Vaim tuli, see viskamine täringut, et teada saada Jumala tahet oli kõrvale pandud.<br/>"<br/><br/>Kuningas Jakoobuse piiblitõlge<br/><br/>See on 1769. aasta King James Version of the Holy Bible (tuntud ka kui Authorized Version). |

In fact, dynamic drivers work exactly the same as dynamic microphones but in reverse. Inside a dynamic driver there is a magnet, and when you plug in the headphones, you are sending a AC current through it which will turn the voice coil into a magnet. Depending on the direction of the current, the polarity of the magnet will change. Now since we know for a magnet, same charges repels and different charges attract, we know that the voice coil will move back and forth depending on it's polarity at the time. The voice coil is attached to the diaphragm which will then move back and forth creating a sound wave. The same occurs in reverse, if you move a coil through a magnet you produce a current instead. Since your voice is pushing the diaphragm, it is moving the voice coil back and forth generating the current you have observed.<br/><br/>100+ Head-Fier<br/><br/>Joined:<br/>Nov 7, 2011<br/><br/>Posts:<br/>134<br/><br/>Likes: 55<br/><br/>Exactly.

Stalin's opposition within the party, including Bukharin, Yagoda and Rykov were purged in these show trials, as Stalin manipulatively forced them to confess to crimes of planning a coup and opposing the state, even if there was no proof. Gabor T Rittersporn said, "Many of the victims were sincerely devoted to the principles of Bolshevism." This amplifies proof that the Bolshevik ideals that had once been the roots of the Communist Party were being disarranged and destroyed by the Purges. The party was depleted and former members helplessly watched Stalin use the great purge as a tool to transform Russia from a one party state to an unchallenged dictatorship. Again, the purges were shattering the framework of the Communist Party, formed during the Bolshevik revolution. This agrees with the "Stalin the executioner" source as both show the manipulative character, that helped the dictator to enhance his grip on Russia's throat.<br/>The manipulative manner, with which Stalin incriminated his targeted opposition during the purges, in the eyes of everyday Russians, also had an implosive impact on Soviet Society. Stalin was able to collect support from the people through his use of propaganda and the media to help him develop a "cult of personality" and the image of a heroic and brave leader. Through this support Stalin implanted mistrust into the minds of the people, convincing them that traitors of the revolution and what he described as 'enemies of the people', were amongst them.

Stalini opositsioon parteis, sealhulgas Buhhariin, Jagoda ja Rykov, puhastati nendes näituste kohtuprotsessides, kuna Stalin sundis neid manipuleerivalt üles tunnistama riigipöörde kavandamise ja riigivastase kuriteod, isegi kui tõendeid ei olnud. Gabor T. Rittersporn ütles: "Paljud ohvrid olid siiralt pühendunud bolševistlikele põhimõtetele." See võimendab tõendeid selle kohta, et bolševike ideaalid, mis olid kunagi kommunistliku partei juured, olid purustatud ja hävitatud Puhastuste poolt. Partei oli ammendatud ja endised liikmed vaatasid abitult, kuidas Stalin kasutas suurt puhastust vahendina, et muuta Venemaa ühe parteiriigist vaidlustamata diktatuuriks. Jällegi purustasid puhastused bolševike revolutsiooni ajal moodustatud Kommunistliku Partei raamistiku. See on kooskõlas allikaga "Stalin timukas", sest mõlemad näitavad manipuleerivat iseloomu, mis aitas diktaatoril tugevdada oma haaret Venemaa kurgus.<br/>Manipuleerival viisil, millega Stalin süüdistas oma sihipärast opositsiooni puhastuste ajal, igapäevaste venelaste silmis, oli ka Nõukogude ühiskonnale implosiivne mõju. Stalin suutis koguda rahvalt toetust, kasutades propagandat ja meediat, et aidata tal arendada "isiksuse kultust" ja kangelasliku ja vapra juhi kujutist. Selle toetusega sisendas Stalin rahva teadvusse usaldamatust, veendes neid, et nende hulgas on revolutsiooni reeturid ja need, keda ta nimetas „rahvavaenlasteks“.<br/><br/>Muud paberid Mis oli lühiajaline tähendus puhastustööd Venemaa valitsuse ja ühiskonna<br/><br/>1203 sõna - 5 lehekülge<br/>Pärast Teist maailmasõda sõlmisid Ameerika Ühendriigid riikidega lepingud, et kõrvaldada tõkked rahvusvahelisele kaubandusele ja investeeringutele.

| Supercell is nerfing brawlers instead of nerfing star powers. I was at 750 last season with power 8 nita and it is very tough to go past that, like, star powers play a really dominant role. The matchmaking is also trash. When i play gem grab(around 600 trophies), there are often matchups where the enemy team has one more player than us who is maxed and it's not even that we have a lvl 9 to compete versus that. Sometimes there are even matchups where the enemy team is fully maxed and none of us are. this is why i dont play brawl stars seriously anymore. It's not even like there arent many players who are not maxed and around 600 trophies. It's annoying.<br/>Edit: I think supercell should have at least a basic mechanism that takes the average of levels of brawlers when setting up matches.<br/><br/>Except trophies don't really indicate your skill. They indicate the skill of the teammates you are placed with. And I'm fine with playing against higher level brawlers, but when one team is all level 10 and the other team isn't, clearly it's unbalanced.<br/><br/>I reccomend getting some good friends to play with, me and 2 friends got my friends power 1 tick to rank 28 by playing gem grab with a certain composition all day and we made it without a single one of us being maxed with our brawlers.<br/><br/>I Know how you feel I used to have brawlers in high trophies with low level and it's to difficult to go more further and everything I was saying to myself "I want to have star powers" really supercell needs to make balance to the star powers or at least make a better matchmaking system.<br/><br/>I kinda feel this. I ain't as good at the game as you, but I got Emz to 500 at power 1 and the matchmaking was horrible. Maxed out players everywhere! And it didn't help that the majority of my teammates had around 5-8k trophies... I had to resort to solo showdown last minute because I can either ambush unsuspecting players or simply play a little aggressive at the right times. But I really wish that it could be a bit easier for people who want to push brawlers to really high trophy ranges without having the luxury of star powers.<br/><br/>Altho spike is still good without curveball. Curveball was just a help for hitting your shots more often as spike. But even before curveball was released, spike was a really strong brawler, so he will remain the same now.<br/><br/>I agree that they should have nerfed ambush, but I think they are trying to balance both Snappy Sniping and Ambush, as they are both getting merged with this change. She was becoming a little powerful, but still not nerf-worthy<br/><br/>I'm not sure about this, but now that Darryl got a noticeable buff, looking at their new stats, it looks like Darryl might overshadow Bull, as not only he can always deal more damage than Bull, he won't die as early anymore, so their survivability will be similar without star power (although Bull's survivability is still noticeably better than Darryl's if he had Tough Guy). Not only that, Darryl's super can auto regenerate, meaning Darryl MIGHT be able to be played effectively both as a heavyweight AND an assassin at the same time (before he sucks as a heavyweight but decent as an assassin)<br/><br/>But hes overrated af. And you get trophies with him really easily. So im kinda ok with the nerf. I havent even played him since when I got him to 500 (around 5 months ago), so not that I care that much either.<br/><br/>Why doesn't Poco/Penny get a HP nerf, if they are Marksman/Healer respectively not a tank?<br/>Why isn't Rosa's tankyness nerfed, cough 70% damage reduction?<br/>Why is Tick allowed to have the highest range and the most free pokedamage in the entire game?<br/>Why doesn't Leon get a HP/Damage buff?<br/><br/>Be that as it may, it was Ambush that was OP, not base Piper. I would argue that Ambush is the best star power in the game (now even more so since the percentage of damage increase indirectly went up) and base Piper was a bottom-10 brawler.<br/><br/>What Supercell should do is revert both nerfs, reduce Ambush to 600, and reduce Snappy Sniping to 0.25 since it'd be indirectly buffed by the base damage buff.<br/><br/>Yea and I believe they went a bit too far with Rosa, because now she is basically the better bull now when it comes to tanking, which she has been for a while. Now, Darryl might as well be a smaller, more powerful bull<br/><br/>Why? I feel she needs a buff in almost everything except her star power. Her health and speed make her super a bit more difficult to use, because she can die pretty easily, and it is really difficult for her to trap faster brawlers like Crow. Her star power is a bit broken though... | Supercell on närviline võitlejad asemel närviline star volitused. Ma olin 750 eelmisel hooajal võimsusega 8 nita ja see on väga raske minna mööda, et nagu star volitused mängivad tõesti domineeriv roll. Match on ka rämps. Kui ma mängin kalliskivi haarata (umbes 600 trofeed), on sageli matchups, kus vaenlase meeskond on üks mängija rohkem kui meie, kes on maxed ja see ei ole isegi, et meil on lvl 9 versus et. Mõnikord on isegi matchups kus vaenlane meeskond on täielikult maxed ja keegi meist ei ole. sellepärast ma ei mängi kaklus tähed tõsiselt enam. See ei ole isegi nagu seal on arent paljud mängijad, kes ei ole maxed ja umbes 600 trofeed. See on tüütu.<br/>Edit: Ma arvan, et supercell peaks olema vähemalt põhiline mehhanism, mis võtab keskmiselt tasemed võitlejad seadistamisel vasteid.<br/><br/>Välja arvatud trofeed, ei näita sinu oskust. Nad näitavad sinu meeskonnakaaslaste oskusi. Ja ma olen hea, kui mängid kõrgema taseme võitlejate vastu, kuid kui üks meeskond on kõik 10. tasemel ja teine ei ole, on see selgelt tasakaalustamata.<br/><br/>Ma recommend saada mõned head sõbrad mängida, mina ja 2 sõbrad sain mu sõbrad võimsus 1 puuk auaste 28 mängides gem haarata teatud kompositsioon kogu päeva ja me tegime seda ilma ühe meist on maxed meie brawlers.<br/><br/>Ma tean, kuidas sa tunned, et mul oli varem kõrgeid trofeesid, millel on madal tase, ja see on raske minna kaugemale ja kõik, mida ma ütlesin endale "Ma tahan, et mul oleks star powers", peab supercell tõesti tasakaalustama star powers või vähemalt tegema parema match süsteemi.<br/><br/>Ma tunnen seda. Ma ei ole mängus nii hea kui sina, kuid ma sain Emz 500i võimsusega 1 ja match oli kohutav. Maxed mängijad kõikjal! Ja see ei aidanud, et enamikul minu meeskonnakaaslastel oli umbes 5-8k trofeed ... Ma pidin viimasel minutil kasutama soolo showdowni, sest ma võin kas varitseda pahaaimamatuid mängijaid või lihtsalt mängida natuke agressiivselt õigel ajal. Aga ma tõesti soovin, et see võiks olla natuke lihtsam inimestele, kes tahavad suruda kaklejad tõesti kõrge trofee vahemikud, ilma et oleks luksus star volitused.<br/><br/>Altho nael on endiselt hea ilma kurvipall. Kurvipall oli lihtsalt abiks lööb oma kaadrid sagedamini kui nael. Aga isegi enne kurvipall vabastati, nael oli tõesti tugev võitleja, nii et ta jääb samaks nüüd.<br/><br/>Ma nõustun, et nad oleksid pidanud närve varitsema, kuid ma arvan, et nad püüavad tasakaalustada nii Snappy Snipingi kui ka Ambushi, kuna nad mõlemad ühinevad selle muudatusega. Ta oli muutumas natuke võimsaks, kuid ei ole ikka veel närvi väärt<br/><br/>Ma ei ole selles kindel, kuid nüüd, kui Darryl sai märgatava fänni, vaadates nende uusi statistikaid, tundub, et Darryl võib Bulli varjutada, sest mitte ainult ta ei saa alati rohkem kahju kui Bull, ta ei sure enam nii varakult, nii et nende ellujäämine on sarnane ilma staarvõimsuseta (kuigi Bulli ellujäämine on endiselt märgatavalt parem kui Darryl's Guy, kui tal oli Tough). Mitte ainult, et Darryl super saab automaatselt regenereeruda, mis tähendab, et Darryl VÕIB olla võimalik tõhusalt mängida nii raskekaalu kui ka palgamõrvarina samal ajal (enne kui ta imeb raskekaalu, kuid korraliku palgamõrvarina)<br/><br/>Aga ta on ülehinnatud af. Ja sa saad trofeed temaga tõesti kergesti. Nii im mingi ok närvi. Ma ei ole isegi mänginud teda, sest kui ma sain teda 500 (umbes 5 kuud tagasi), nii et ma ei hooli nii palju ka.<br/><br/>Miks Poco/Penny ei saa HP närvi, kui nad on Marksman/Healer vastavalt mitte tank?<br/>Miks ei ole Rosa tankiness närviline, köha 70% kahju vähenemist?<br/>Miks on Tickil lubatud kogu mängus kõige kõrgem vahemik ja kõige tasuta pokedamage?<br/>Miks Leon ei saa HP/Damage'i fänni?<br/><br/>Olgu kuidas on, see oli Ambush, mis oli OP, mitte base Piper. Ma väidaksin, et Ambush on parim star power mängus (nüüd veelgi enam, kuna kahju suurenemise protsent kaudselt tõusis) ja base Piper oli alumine-10 võitleja.<br/><br/>Mida Supercell peaks tegema, on mõlema närvi tagasipööramine, varitsuse vähendamine 600-ni ja Snappy Snipingi vähendamine 0,25-ni, kuna see oleks kaudselt kahjustatud baasi kahjustustega.<br/><br/>Jah ja ma usun, et nad läksid Rosaga natuke liiga kaugele, sest nüüd on ta tankimise osas põhimõtteliselt parem pull, mida ta on juba mõnda aega olnud. Nüüd võib Darryl olla ka väiksem, võimsam pull<br/><br/>Miks? Ma tunnen, et ta vajab peaaegu kõike, välja arvatud tema star power. Tema tervis ja kiirus muudavad teda super natuke raskemaks kasutada, sest ta võib surra üsna kergesti ja tal on tõesti raske püüda kiiremaid võitlejaid nagu Crow. Tema staaride võim on natuke katki, kuigi... |

| Self-Employment Part 1<br/><br/>When you accept an employment in any organisation, you have to perform various jobs as per the requirements of your employer and you may get a fixed amount of income as salary. You may run a small retail shop, tailoring shop, restaurant, bakery and confectionery, beauty salon, etc. in your locality. You may get engaged in trading or manufacturing on a small scale or providing some service for a price. Such economic activities are known as self-employment.<br/><br/>Meaning of Self-Employment<br/><br/>Earning is necessary for a living. Our father, mother, brothers, sisters and others may be engaged in different economic activities through which they earn their livelihood. These persons are engaged in an economic activity which is termed as wage employment or paid employment. But there are many persons who engage themselves in an occupation or some business which they start and manage on their own. They put in their best effort and take all types of risks to pursue their careers successfully. The entire earning of their work goes to them. All of us have seen small grocery shops, tailoring shops, medical stores etc. in our locality. These are owned and managed by a person, with or without the help of some assistants. Their economic activities are termed as self-employment.

Thus, self-employment may provide employment to other persons as well.<br/><br/>The earning from self-employment is not fixed. It depends on the income one can earn by producing or buying and selling goods or providing services to others at a price.<br/><br/>In self-employment, the owner alone has to take the profit and bear the risk of loss. So, we find a direct link between the effort and reward in self-employment.<br/><br/>It requires some amount of capital investment, although it may be small.<br/><br/>In self-employment, a person is free to take decisions in respect of running his business profitably and avail of any opportunity that may come up for expansion of his business. It gives complete freedom to work as per one's own will and within the parameters of the prevailing laws.<br/><br/>Thus, self-employment may be defined as, an economic activity which one may perform on his own as a gainful occupation, and this may consist of producing and selling goods, buying and selling goods, or rendering services for a price. | Füüsilisest isikust ettevõtja 1. osa<br/><br/>Kui võtad vastu töö mõnes organisatsioonis, pead tegema erinevaid töid vastavalt oma tööandja nõuetele ja võid saada kindla summa sissetulekut palgana.
