| Forty-nine years ago today, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act of 1965.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Nearly a century ago, the 15th Amendment to the Constitution stated, "The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of race, color or previous condition of servitude." And nearly a century before that, our nation's founding fathers set in motion the great experiment of American democracy by declaring that "all men are created equal."<br/><br/>The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was a belated acknowledgment that even in America, our foundational ideals carry little weight if not protected by the rule of law. That's why Section 2 of the 15th Amendment granted Congress the "power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation."<br/><br/>And indeed, the codified language of the Voting Rights Act was able to achieve what the Reconstruction-era Congress and Thomas Jefferson could not. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act—and the civil rights movement from which they emerged—served as the catalyst for a dramatic increase in the opportunity for black Americans to participate in the democratic process.<br/><br/>For example, only 6.7 percent of eligible black Mississippians were registered to vote as of 1962; by 1969 that figure had reached 66.5 percent. Today, Mississippi has more black elected officials than any other state.<br/><br/>The protections put in place by the Voting Rights Act were long overdue when they were passed, representative of the arduous struggle with which they were achieved. But unthinkably, these protections are now under assault, jeopardizing the progress our nation worked so hard to achieve.<br/><br/>Last year, in the case of Shelby County v. Holder, the U.S. Supreme Court gutted a key component of the Voting Rights Act that enabled prior federal review to ensure nondiscrimination before any new voting law went into effect.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Sadly, the response of Republican leaders has been to do nothing. Sen. Ted Cruz and Gov. Rick Perry went out of their way to praise the Supreme Court's decision. Sen. Rand Paul dismissed the continued necessity of the Voting Rights Act by noting, "We have an African-American president."<br/><br/>While the election of President Barack Obama was indeed a historic milestone, it is dangerous to think that it absolves us from remaining vigilant against the lingering consequences of our nation's past. The haste with which states have moved to enact voting restrictions is confirmation that the protections put in place by Section 4 are still necessary.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Republican governors have signed strict photo-identification restrictions into law as the solution to a virtually nonexistent problem of voter impersonation, disproportionately hurting women, young people, working families and the African-American community. It's disingenuous for Republicans like Paul to seek the votes of these communities when they believe "there's nothing wrong with" putting restrictions in place that make it harder for these constituencies to vote.<br/><br/>Republicans have also sought to restrict early-voting periods, including the Sunday before Election Day, when African-American churches have had great success with Souls to the Polls programs.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>These restrictions represent a callous effort by Republicans to make voting harder, based on narrow, short-term political calculations that Republicans can win elections by shrinking the size of the electorate.<br/><br/>Democrats have a very different mission when it comes to voting: to ensure that every eligible voter can register, that every registered voter can vote and that every vote is accurately counted.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>The Democratic National Committee's Voter Expansion Project reflects our belief that greater voter participation strengthens our nation and our democracy. We'll continue to use our unmatched institutional knowledge to protect voting rights against legislation and tactics that would attempt to suppress the vote. And because the best defense is a good offense, we're also working to expand the vote by deploying our technology and data resources to register new voters.<br/><br/>On this anniversary, one of the best ways we can honor those who struggled—and in some cases gave their very lives—for the legislation's passage is for Republicans in Congress to join Democrats in passing the Voting Rights Amendment Act to restore the promise of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Democrat, represents Florida's 23rd Congressional District in the United States Congress. Since 2011, she has served as chair of the Democratic National Committee. Follow her on Twitter.<br/><br/>The Root aims to foster and advance conversations about issues relevant to the black Diaspora by presenting a variety of opinions from all perspectives, whether or not those opinions are shared by our editorial staff. | 49 aastat tagasi kirjutas president Lyndon B. Johnson alla 1965. aasta hääletamisõiguse seadusele.<br/><br/>Reklaam<br/><br/>Ligi sada aastat tagasi sätestas põhiseaduse 15. parandus: "Ameerika Ühendriikide kodanike hääleõigust ei tohi Ameerika Ühendriigid ega ükski riik eirata ega lühendada rassi, nahavärvuse või varasema orjuse tõttu." Ja peaaegu sajand enne seda, meie rahva asutajad käivitasid Ameerika demokraatia suure eksperimendi, kuulutades, et "kõik inimesed on loodud võrdseks".<br/><br/>1965. aasta hääletamisõiguste seadus oli hilinenud kinnitus, et isegi Ameerikas on meie põhiideaalidel vähe kaalu, kui neid ei kaitse õigusriik. Sellepärast andis 15. muudatuse 2. jagu kongressile "volitused selle artikli jõustamiseks asjakohaste õigusaktidega".<br/><br/>Ja tõepoolest, hääleõiguste seaduse kodifitseeritud keel suutis saavutada seda, mida rekonstrueerimisajastu kongress ja Thomas Jefferson ei suutnud. 1964. aasta kodanikuõiguste seadus ja hääletamisõiguste seadus - ja kodanikuõiguste liikumine, millest nad tekkisid - teenisid katalüsaatorina mustade ameeriklaste demokraatlikus protsessis osalemise võimaluse dramaatiliseks suurendamiseks.<br/><br/>Näiteks ainult 6,7 protsenti abikõlblikest mustanahalistest Mississippis registreeriti hääletamiseks 1962. aastal; 1969. aastaks oli see arv jõudnud 66,5 protsendini. Täna on Mississippis rohkem mustanahalisi valitud ametnikke kui üheski teises riigis.<br/><br/>Hääletusõiguste seadusega kehtestatud kaitsed olid juba ammu aegunud, kui need vastu võeti, mis esindas rasket võitlust, millega need saavutati. Kuid mõeldamatult on need kaitsed nüüd rünnaku all, ohustades meie rahva nii rasket edu.<br/><br/>Eelmisel aastal Shelby maakonna vs. Holderi juhtumil eemaldas USA ülemkohus hääletamisõiguste seaduse põhikomponendi, mis võimaldas eelnevalt föderaalset läbivaatamist, et tagada mittediskrimineerimine enne uue hääletusseaduse jõustumist.<br/><br/>Reklaam<br/><br/>Senaator Ted Cruz ja kuberner Rick Perry läksid oma teed, et kiita ülemkohtu otsust. Senaator Rand Paul ignoreeris valimisõiguste seaduse jätkuvat vajalikkust, märkides: "Meil on afroameerika president."<br/><br/>Kuigi president Barack Obama valimine oli tõepoolest ajalooline verstapost, on ohtlik arvata, et see vabastab meid valvsaks jäämisest meie rahva mineviku pikaajaliste tagajärgede suhtes. Kiirus, millega riigid on hääletamispiirangute kehtestamisele asunud, kinnitab, et 4. jaos sätestatud kaitsemeetmed on endiselt vajalikud.<br/><br/>Reklaam<br/><br/>Vabariiklastest kubernerid on allkirjastanud ranged fotode tuvastamise piirangud seadusele kui lahenduse praktiliselt olematule probleemile valijate kehastamisel, mis ebaproportsionaalselt kahjustab naisi, noori, töötavaid perekondi ja afroameerika kogukonda. On ebaaus, et vabariiklased nagu Paul otsivad nende kogukondade hääli, kui nad usuvad, et "ei ole midagi valesti", kehtestades piiranguid, mis muudavad nende valimisringkondade hääletamise raskemaks.<br/><br/>Vabariiklased on ka püüdnud piirata varajase hääletamise perioode, sealhulgas pühapäeval enne valimiste päeva, kui Aafrika-Ameerika kirikud on saavutanud suurt edu Souls to the Polls programmides.<br/><br/>Reklaam<br/><br/>Need piirangud kujutavad endast vabariiklaste kalgiid jõupingutusi hääletamise raskendamiseks, tuginedes kitsastele, lühiajalistele poliitilistele arvutustele, et vabariiklased võivad valimisi võita valijaskonna suuruse kahanemisega.<br/><br/>Demokraatidel on hääletamisel väga erinev missioon: tagada, et kõik kandidaadid saaksid registreeruda, et kõik registreeritud valijad saaksid hääletada ja et iga hääl loetaks täpselt.<br/><br/>Reklaam<br/><br/>Demokraatliku Rahvuskomitee valijate laiendamise projekt peegeldab meie veendumust, et suurem valijate osalus tugevdab meie rahvast ja demokraatiat. Me jätkame oma ületamatute institutsionaalsete teadmiste kasutamist, et kaitsta hääleõigust seadusandluse ja taktika eest, mis üritaks hääletamist maha suruda. Ja kuna parim kaitse on hea solvang, töötame ka hääletuse laiendamiseks, kasutades meie tehnoloogiat ja andmeressursse uute valijate registreerimiseks.<br/><br/>Sellel aastapäeval on üks parimaid viise, kuidas me austame neid, kes võitlesid - ja mõnel juhul andsid oma elu -, sest seaduse eelnõu on vabariiklaste jaoks kongressis, et ühineda demokraatidega hääletamisõiguste muutmise seaduse vastuvõtmisel, et taastada 1965. aasta hääletamisõiguste seaduse lubadus.<br/><br/>Reklaam<br/><br/>Debbie Wasserman Schultz, demokraat, esindab Florida 23. kongressiringkonda Ameerika Ühendriikide Kongressis. Alates 2011. aastast on ta olnud Demokraatliku Rahvuskomitee esimees. Jälgi teda Twitteris.<br/><br/>Juure eesmärk on edendada ja edendada arutelusid mustade diasporaa jaoks olulistel teemadel, esitades erinevaid arvamusi kõigist vaatenurkadest, olenemata sellest, kas need arvamused on meie toimetuspersonaliga jagatud või mitte. |
| Q&A: Vatican safeguarding expert Fr Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>13 June 2021<br/><br/>Fr Hans Zollner SJ. Image: Australian Jesuits.<br/><br/>The President of the Centre for Child Protection at the Gregorian University in Rome, and a member of the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors, Fr Hans Zollner SJ, was in Australia in 2018 to speak to Catholic ministry leaders and survivors.<br/><br/>Michael McVeigh from Jesuit Communications sat down with him during the visit to explore how the Church is responding to the abuse crisis internationally, and what can be learned from our experiences in Australia.<br/><br/>MM: This is your third trip to Australia. You've visited quite a few other countries to see how the Church is responding to abuse around the world. Can you give us some idea of what the global picture looks like?<br/><br/>Fr Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>HZ: My understanding, after having visited about 50 countries on five or six continents, is that the Church is really starting to move over the last couple of years on the issue of doing justice to victims, of listening to them, and doing whatever can be done in terms of safeguarding.<br/><br/>I was with the Jesuit Provincials from all over Africa at the end of April, and the President of the Jesuit Assistancy of Africa and Madagascar is very much committed and dedicated to this. He has put up a thorough action plan for formation and for introducing guidelines all over the place. It's a very considerate and very deliberate effort to do whatever can be done to be proactively engaged as Jesuits in Africa — in a continent where until a few years ago all of this was a foreign language.<br/><br/>One of the challenges of trying to develop this global approach is that you're dealing with so many cultures, and so many different understandings. How do you bring this together and try to provide training and support religious communities tackling these issues?<br/><br/>This is one of the major questions we have. I think what I can do is stimulate discussion, stimulate reflection, and prepare people as much as possible so that they can do the groundwork.<br/><br/>The Centre for Child Protection at the Gregorian University does not pretend to have the response to every question. Not only because we don't know the specific contexts — we might know a few of them, but we're talking about thousands of cultures, we're talking about hundreds of languages, we're talking about very diverse legal backgrounds. It varies even sometimes within one country, such as Australia where you have states within the Commonwealth of Australia that have different laws than other states.<br/><br/>I am somebody who tries to elicit and stimulate discussion and reflection. I'm also very happy to listen to people.<br/><br/>You mentioned the need to listen and support victims in being heard. We've obviously had the Royal Commission here in Australia, but what are some of the other ways that you've seen that the voices of victims are being supported around the world?<br/><br/>In France there is one diocese that has established what they call 'The Listening Space'. There, victims can come forward and they can express themselves. The bishop is present. It's an open space in which people who have been hurt tremendously are free at least to express what they want to ask from the Church leadership etc.<br/><br/>There are other places in the USA or in other countries where victims have been invited by dioceses, by Provinces, by the leadership of the Church, to come forward. I have to say that overall I think there is a good will, and there are more people like bishops and provincials who listen to victims than we know. But there is no one model of giving victims not only the space to express themselves and be listened to, but also to engage actively in Church development.<br/><br/>In terms of setting up spaces for support for victims, what are some of the things you've seen that could really help — and that we could be considering here in Australia?<br/><br/>One of the major points that many victims bring up is, 'Can't we have, within parish settings, within schools settings, a regular conversation going on that includes survivors of abuse as regular members of a committee, a commission, a sounding board, a feedback group or something like that?' So that this voice is not only brought in on a specific occasion, or where a person feels like he or she is at a point to be able to speak out about it, but [is heard] on a regular basis — build that voice into the system.<br/><br/>That will help all of us. It will help survivors and victims because they will feel welcome and appreciated in the specific experience, and in the specific life challenges, that they went through. Secondly it will help the community at large, because we can at least make ourselves more and more sensitive to what the concerns and specific needs of survivors are — that can also talk to the needs of young people.<br/><br/>M: We have strong groups of survivors here in Australia who have been able to support each other through that process. But what you're saying is that we need some way of supporting those groups, and supporting those people, through our own institutions as well?<br/><br/>And I think we need to be creative. It will work for one school and one parish and one diocese in one way, and for others in a different way. Because the survivors with whom I am in constant contact, they have quite similar requests, and similar experiences in regard to being welcomed in the Church or not — feeling thrown out or dismissed. But they have also among themselves quite different expectations. So I have learned that you have also to be very forthcoming in accepting the differences in what this specific group, or this specific survivor, wants, requests and needs.<br/><br/>M: Survivors talk about wanting to have their stories heard and acknowledged. We've had the Royal Commission here in Australia, which provided an independent process where victims could come forward. Is there a need for something like that in terms of a truth, justice and reconciliation process for the Church internationally?<br/><br/>H: Yes, I think there is a need for that internationally. But I think first every local church needs to do its own homework. I don't see it happening very soon that some such council or commission would be established to look into this area for the whole Church. The Church has a membership of 1.3 billion people, and is present in 190 countries, with all kinds of differences in expectations concerning psychological, spiritual and financial support.<br/><br/>There is one thing that I have come across consistently in communicating with, working with and listening to victims, and that is that they want to be listened to. So if there was the feeling that victims were constantly being listened to — in Rome and elsewhere — I think that would give a great relief to many victims.<br/><br/>I think [Pope Francis'] concern, especially with regard to your question, is that the local churches do whatever they can so that victims will be listened to in that particular country. I have a list of people who want to speak to the Holy Father directly, and physically it is impossible. I was there in 2014 to translate for two German survivors who were chosen with two Irish and two English survivors when he received the six of them at home. He took the whole morning listening to them one after the other. For each one, he was there for 40 to 45 minutes. Were he to do this for every survivor he couldn't sleep anymore.<br/><br/>His example is modelling for the whole Catholic Church the way victims and survivors are received, welcomed and listened to. I think if the bishops and the provincials in this world, in all countries, followed his example, many survivors would be really appreciative of that.<br/><br/>Archbishop Diarmud Martin was recently quoted just before the World Meeting of Families, about the Pontifical Commission, saying that it's too small as it's currently set up to achieve what it needs to achieve. What's your take on that? Does the Church need to be putting more resources into how it's overseeing those issues?<br/><br/>At the moment we are 16 members from basically all continents, and the major language groups. We represent a variety of disciplines and professions, and the purpose of the commission — as the statutes that have just been promulgated state — is to provide counsel to the Holy Father.<br/><br/>A common misunderstanding about the commission is first that we deal with cases of allegations. That is not the case. We have no juridical or administrative power in regards to cases, because when it comes to allegations of abuse the tribunals and procedure are set.<br/><br/>A second misunderstanding is that we promote, directly, things on the ground. Our first and foremost goal is that we advise the Holy Father on issues.<br/><br/>So from my point of view, yes, we need to invest more. But we need to invest more on the local level, and we need to make sure that the proposals from the Pontifical Commission are forwarded to the Holy Father — which normally the President does — and then there is a follow-up process that reflects what we have given as our advice.<br/><br/>In Australia, Catholic Professional Standards Limited is overseeing the Church's response and providing guidelines and support for ensuring all the institutions in the Church are child-safe institutions. Is there a need for some kind of organisational support from Rome for those bishops and dioceses that are struggling to form these institutions and provide safeguarding in those dioceses?<br/><br/>I think ultimately the commission will develop in that line. They are now in the process of hiring experts in those areas.<br/><br/>I think the Church needs to understand that the local churches can learn from each other mutually. And my understanding has always been — and I think the Holy Father has reminded us — that the Church will not function as a centralised company. It does not work like that, effectively. Every bishop, every bishops conference, has, to some extent, its life on its own. What we need to learn more is to open channels of mutual communication.<br/><br/>There are a number of things that people blame for abuse in the Church. As a priest and a psychologist, and as someone who has met and worked with survivors, what are your thoughts on that issue?<br/><br/>I think the question of where does abuse come from is the most important one, and the Pope has addressed that in his letter to the people of God published on 20 August. He says in the first paragraph, and repeats it over and over again, that the question of sexual abuse is always linked — or almost always linked — not only to the question of abuse of power, but also to the abuse of conscience.<br/><br/>So the real fundamental question of abuse is much more complex than just [the question of] sexuality — be it heterosexual or homosexual. It's a power issue, and there we have to really work on the question of how do we understand priesthood, how to we understand bishophood, how do we understand and live out our ministries? What are the boundaries?<br/><br/>That's why I'm very happy that the Jesuit Province in Australia is establishing a Code of Conduct. Because we don't talk only about sexual abuse of minors. We talk about sexual abuse of adults, and we talk about abuse in other ways — like abuse of conscience, where you dictate to someone what you think, or you pretend to know by God, and you can tell another person, 'You need to do that', against the conscience of that person.<br/><br/>Many people think celibacy produces abuse. As I always say, celibacy as such is not cause for abusing — otherwise how do we explain that 99.9 per cent of all abusers do not live a celibate life, and how do we explain that 95 or 96 per cent of all priests do not abuse minors? But, celibacy, or a vow of chastity, that is not really integrated, that is not really lived out properly — yes, that produces a problem. Sometimes people take to drinking, sometime they take to gambling, and sometimes they take to sexual misconduct, with adults and with minors.<br/><br/>The real question about this is how do we deal with the notion of religious spiritual power with which priests and bishops are invested? How can theology help us to understand, and maybe how can sociology, psychology, or business administration help us to define the limits of power, and the necessity of keeping your boundaries | Küsimused ja vastused: Vatikani kaitseekspert Fr Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>13. juuni 2021<br/><br/>Fr Hans Zollner SJ. Pilt: Austraalia jesuiidid.<br/><br/>Rooma Gregoriuse Ülikooli lastekaitsekeskuse president ja alaealiste kaitse paavstliku komisjoni liige Hans Zollner SJ oli 2018. aastal Austraalias, et rääkida katoliku ministeeriumi juhtide ja ellujäänutega.<br/><br/>Michael McVeigh Jesuiitide Kommunikatsioonist istus visiidi ajal temaga, et uurida, kuidas Kirik reageerib kuritarvitamise kriisile rahvusvaheliselt ja mida saab õppida meie kogemustest Austraalias.<br/><br/>MM: See on teie kolmas reis Austraaliasse. Olete külastanud paljusid teisi riike, et näha, kuidas kirik reageerib väärkohtlemisele kogu maailmas. Kas oskate anda meile aimu, milline näeb välja globaalne pilt?<br/><br/>Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>HZ: Minu arusaam, olles külastanud umbes 50 riiki viiel või kuuel kontinendil, on see, et kirik on viimastel aastatel tõesti hakanud liikuma ohvrite õigluse tagamise, nende kuulamise ja selle nimel, mida iganes saab teha.<br/><br/>Ma olin aprilli lõpus jesuiitide provintsidega üle kogu Aafrika ning Aafrika ja Madagaskari jesuiitide assistendi president on sellele väga pühendunud ja pühendunud. Ta on koostanud põhjaliku tegevuskava koolitamiseks ja suuniste kehtestamiseks kõikjal. See on väga läbimõeldud ja väga tahtlik katse teha kõik, mida saab teha, et olla ennetavalt kaasatud kui jesuiidid Aafrikas - mandril, kus kuni paar aastat tagasi oli see kõik võõrkeel.<br/><br/>Üks väljakutseid selle globaalse lähenemise arendamisel on see, et te tegelete nii paljude kultuuridega ja nii paljude erinevate arusaamadega. Kuidas te selle kokku panete ning püüate pakkuda koolitust ja toetada religioosseid kogukondi nende küsimustega tegelemisel?<br/><br/>Ma arvan, et see, mida ma teha saan, on ergutada arutelu, stimuleerida mõtisklust ja valmistada inimesi ette nii palju kui võimalik, et nad saaksid teha aluse.<br/><br/>Gregoriuse Ülikooli lastekaitse keskus ei teeskle, et tal on vastus igale küsimusele. Mitte ainult sellepärast, et me ei tea konkreetseid kontekste - me võime teada mõnda neist, kuid me räägime tuhandetest kultuuridest, me räägime sadadest keeltest, me räägime väga erinevast õiguslikust taustast. See varieerub isegi mõnikord ühes riigis, näiteks Austraalias, kus teil on Austraalia Rahvaste Ühenduse riigid, millel on teistest riikidest erinevad seadused.<br/><br/>Ma olen keegi, kes püüab tekitada ja stimuleerida arutelu ja mõtisklust. Samuti on mul väga hea meel kuulata inimesi.<br/><br/>Te mainisite vajadust kuulata ja toetada ohvreid, et neid ära kuulataks. Ilmselgelt on meil siin Austraalias kuninglik komisjon, kuid millised on mõned muud viisid, kuidas te olete näinud, et ohvrite hääli toetatakse kogu maailmas?<br/><br/>Prantsusmaal on üks piiskopkond, mis on rajanud nn kuulamisruumi, kus ohvrid saavad end väljendada ja piiskop on kohal. See on avatud ruum, kus inimesed, kes on saanud tohutult haiget, on vabad väljendama vähemalt seda, mida nad tahavad Kiriku juhtkonnalt paluda jne.<br/><br/>On ka teisi kohti USA-s või teistes riikides, kus piiskopkonnad, provintsid ja Kiriku juhtkond on kutsunud ohvreid esinema. Pean ütlema, et üldiselt on minu arvates olemas hea tahe ning piiskoppide ja provintsiametnike sarnaseid inimesi, kes kuulavad ohvreid, on rohkem kui me teame. Kuid pole olemas mudelit, mis annaks ohvritele ruumi mitte ainult eneseväljenduseks ja kuulamiseks, vaid ka aktiivseks osalemiseks Kiriku arengus.<br/><br/>Mis puudutab ohvrite toetamise ruumide loomist, millised on mõned asjad, mida olete näinud, mis võiksid tõesti aidata - ja mida me võiksime siin Austraalias kaaluda?<br/><br/>Üks peamisi punkte, mida paljud ohvrid tõstatavad, on: "Kas meil ei saa olla koguduses, koolides toimuvat regulaarset vestlust, mis hõlmab väärkohtlemise ellujäänuid kui komitee, komisjoni, luurekomisjoni, tagasisiderühma või midagi sellist?" Nii et see hääl ei tooda mitte ainult konkreetsel juhul või kui inimene tunneb, et ta on punktis, kus ta saab sellest rääkida, vaid [kuuldakse] regulaarselt - ehitage see hääl süsteemi.<br/><br/>See aitab meid kõiki. See aitab ellujäänuid ja ohvreid, sest nad tunnevad end teretulnuna ja hindavad konkreetset kogemust ja konkreetseid elu väljakutseid, mida nad läbisid. Teiseks aitab see kogukonda laiemalt, sest me saame end vähemalt üha rohkem ja rohkem tundlikuks teha ellujäänute murede ja konkreetsete vajaduste suhtes, mis võivad rääkida ka noorte vajadustega.<br/><br/>M: Meil on siin Austraalias tugevad ellujäänute rühmad, kes on suutnud üksteist selle protsessi kaudu toetada. Aga mida te tahate öelda, on see, et me vajame mingit viisi nende rühmade toetamiseks ja nende inimeste toetamiseks ka meie institutsioonide kaudu?<br/><br/>Ja ma arvan, et me peame olema loomingulised. See töötab ühes koolis, ühes kihelkonnas ja ühes piiskopkonnas ühel viisil ja teistes teisel viisil. Sest ellujäänutel, kellega ma olen pidevas kontaktis, on üsna sarnased palved ja sarnased kogemused seoses sellega, kas nad on Kirikus vastu võetud või mitte – tunne, et nad on välja visatud või vallandatud. Kuid neil on ka üksteisega üsna erinevad ootused, nii et ma olen õppinud, et peate olema ka väga valmis aktsepteerima erinevusi selles, mida see konkreetne grupp või see konkreetne ellujäänu tahab, soovib ja vajab.<br/><br/>M: Ellujäänud räägivad soovist, et nende lugusid kuuldaks ja tunnustataks. Meil on siin Austraalias kuninglik komisjon, mis andis sõltumatu protsessi, kus ohvrid võivad tulla. Kas on vaja midagi sellist tõe, õigluse ja lepitusprotsessi mõttes Kiriku jaoks rahvusvaheliselt?<br/><br/>H: Jah, ma arvan, et see on vajalik rahvusvaheliselt. Aga ma arvan, et kõigepealt peab iga kohalik kirik tegema oma kodutöö. Ma ei näe, et see juhtub väga varsti, et mõni selline nõukogu või komisjon loodaks, et uurida seda valdkonda kogu kiriku jaoks. Kiriku liikmeskond on 1,3 miljardit inimest ja see on esindatud 190 riigis, kus on igasuguseid erinevusi psühholoogilise, vaimse ja rahalise toetuse ootustes.<br/><br/>On üks asi, millega ma olen järjekindlalt kokku puutunud ohvritega suhtlemisel, nendega töötamisel ja nende kuulamisel, ja see on see, et nad tahavad, et neid kuulataks. Seega, kui oleks tunne, et ohvreid kuulatakse pidevalt - Roomas ja mujal -, siis ma arvan, et see annaks paljudele ohvritele suurt kergendust.<br/><br/>Ma arvan, et [Paavst Franciscuse] mure, eriti seoses teie küsimusega, on see, et kohalikud kirikud teevad kõik endast oleneva, et ohvreid selles konkreetses riigis kuulataks. Mul on nimekiri inimestest, kes tahavad rääkida otse Püha Isaga, ja füüsiliselt on see võimatu. Olin seal 2014. aastal, et tõlkida kahte saksa ellujäänut, kes valiti koos kahe iirlase ja kahe inglise ellujäänuga, kui ta sai kuus neist kodus. Ta võttis kogu hommiku kuulates neid üksteise järel. Ta oli seal 40-45 minutit iga ellujäänu eest, kes enam magada ei saanud.<br/><br/>Tema eeskuju on eeskujuks kogu katoliku kirikule, kuidas ohvreid ja ellujäänuid vastu võetakse, tervitatakse ja kuulatakse. Ma arvan, et kui piiskopid ja provintslased selles maailmas, kõikides riikides, järgiksid tema eeskuju, hindaksid paljud ellujäänud seda väga.<br/><br/>Peapiiskop Diarmud Martinit tsiteeriti hiljuti enne Ülemaailmset Perekondade Kohtumist paavstliku komisjoni kohta, öeldes, et see on liiga väike, kuna see on praegu loodud selleks, et saavutada seda, mida ta peab saavutama. Kas kirik peaks rohkem ressursse suunama sellesse, kuidas ta neid küsimusi jälgib?<br/><br/>Praegu on meil 16 liiget praktiliselt kõigist maailmajagudest ja suurematest keelerühmadest. Me esindame erinevaid distsipliine ja elukutseid ning komisjoni eesmärk – nagu just välja kuulutatud statuudid – on anda Pühale Isale nõu.<br/><br/>Üldine arusaamatus komisjoni kohta on see, et me tegeleme kõigepealt väidetavate juhtumitega. Meil ei ole kohtuasjade puhul õiguslikku ega halduslikku võimu, sest kuritarvitussüüdistustega seoses määratakse kindlaks kohtud ja menetlus.<br/><br/>Teine arusaamatus on see, et me edendame asju otse kohapeal. Meie esimene ja peamine eesmärk on nõustada Püha Isa küsimustes.<br/><br/>Seega, jah, me peame rohkem investeerima. Kuid me peame rohkem investeerima kohalikul tasandil ja me peame tagama, et paavstliku komisjoni ettepanekud edastatakse Pühale Isale – mida tavaliselt teeb president – ja siis on olemas järelprotsess, mis peegeldab seda, mida me oleme oma nõuannetena andnud.<br/><br/>Austraalias jälgib katoliiklik kutsestandardite ettevõte (Catholic Professional Standards Limited) Kiriku vastust ning pakub suuniseid ja tuge, et kõik Kiriku institutsioonid oleksid lastekindlad. Kas on vaja Rooma organisatsioonilist toetust piiskoppidele ja piiskopkondadele, kes võitlevad nende institutsioonide moodustamise ja nendes piiskopkondades kaitse pakkumise eest?<br/><br/>Ma arvan, et komisjon areneb lõpuks selles suunas; nad on nüüd nende valdkondade ekspertide palkamise protsessis.<br/><br/>Ma arvan, et Kirik peab mõistma, et kohalikud kirikud saavad üksteiselt õppida. Ja minu arusaam on alati olnud – ja ma arvan, et Püha Isa on meile meelde tuletanud –, et Kirik ei toimi tsentraliseeritud ettevõttena. See ei toimi nii tõhusalt. Igal piiskopil, igal piiskoppide konverentsil on teatud määral oma elu. Mida me peame rohkem õppima, on avada vastastikuse suhtluse kanalid.<br/><br/>On mitmeid asju, et inimesed süüdistavad kuritarvitamise kirikus. Nagu preester ja psühholoog, ja kui keegi, kes on kohtunud ja töötanud ellujäänutega, mida te arvate selles küsimuses?<br/><br/>Ma arvan, et küsimus, kust kuritarvitused tulevad, on kõige olulisem, ja paavst on pöördunud selle poole oma kirjas Jumala rahvale, mis avaldati 20. augustil. Ta ütleb esimeses lõigus ja kordab seda ikka ja jälle, et seksuaalse kuritarvitamise küsimus on alati seotud - või peaaegu alati seotud - mitte ainult võimu kuritarvitamise küsimusega, vaid ka südametunnistuse kuritarvitamisega.<br/><br/>Seega on kuritarvitamise tõeline fundamentaalne küsimus palju keerulisem kui lihtsalt seksuaalsuse küsimus - olgu see siis heteroseksuaalne või homoseksuaalne. See on võimu küsimus ja seal peame me tõesti töötama küsimusega, kuidas me mõistame preesterlust, kuidas me mõistame piiskopkonda, kuidas me mõistame ja elame oma ministeeriumides? Millised on piirid?<br/><br/>Seepärast on mul väga hea meel, et Austraalia jesuiitide provints kehtestab käitumiskoodeksi, sest me ei räägi ainult alaealiste seksuaalsest kuritarvitamisest. Me räägime täiskasvanute seksuaalsest kuritarvitamisest ja me räägime kuritarvitamisest muul viisil - nagu südametunnistuse kuritarvitamine, kus sa dikteerid kellelegi, mida sa arvad, või teeskled, et sa tead Jumalast, ja sa võid teisele inimesele öelda: "Sa pead seda tegema", selle inimese südametunnistuse vastu.<br/><br/>Paljud inimesed arvavad, et tsölibaat põhjustab väärkohtlemist. Nagu ma alati ütlen, ei ole tsölibaatia kui selline kuritarvitamise põhjus - muidu kuidas me selgitame, et 99,9% kõigist kuritarvitajatest ei ela tsölibaatilist elu ja kuidas me selgitame, et 95% või 96% kõigist preestritest ei kuritarvita alaealisi? Kuid tsölibaat või karskuse tõotus, mis ei ole tegelikult integreeritud, mis ei ole tegelikult korralikult elanud - jah, see tekitab probleemi. Mõnikord võtavad inimesed joomist, mõnikord võtavad nad hasartmänge, ja mõnikord võtavad nad seksuaalset väärkäitumist, nii täiskasvanutele kui ka alaealistele.<br/><br/>Tõeline küsimus on selles, kuidas me suhtume religioosse vaimse jõu mõistesse, millega preestrid ja piiskopid on seotud? Kuidas saab teoloogia aidata meil mõista ja võib-olla kuidas sotsioloogia, psühholoogia või ärijuhtimine aitab meil määratleda võimupiire ja vajadust hoida oma piire |
| I'm not surprised by this mismatch. In fact, I'd even go so far as to say this isn't something that will ever change, nor should we get all steamed up about changing it. In 10 years, we'll still have bleeding edge, complex items in the biggest concerns list, and the things we're finally getting around to understanding will be the major parts of our spending.<br/><br/>Now, Gunnar and Andy both have excellent points, specifically about IT teams seeing IT problems and solving them with IT solutions; in fact, I'm positive their points hold merit.<br/><br/>But I think there are other ideas that trump those (I did comment on their blogs about it, and later decided I should just blog here). Those top 3 concerns are bleedingly new such that:<br/><br/>we fear new things because we don't understand them, or don't understand them because they're new.<br/><br/>they're too new for us to have solid approaches to handling them.<br/><br/>they're too new for us to know if we should be worried or not! we tend to default to paranoid/worried, which is good!<br/><br/>too new to have obvious budget items assigned to them. Can I buy a box or some software that provide "cloud security" or "social media security?"<br/><br/>they're so new the business doesn't even know how to use them or what they want out of them. Let alone how we can secure them while still meeting or at least not stomping all over business needs. If the business doesn't even know how to use them yet, I'm not sure security is in any position to guide that usage securely.<br/><br/>It also should be mentioned that these new things are being largely pushed via consumerland and into the business, with IT as a sort of, "Oh yeah," thought. Firewalls, AV, AM, Auth are all IT responses to typically IT issues. Of course there is a difference there. They're also very subjective issues, as opposed to very objective items like firewalls, known malicious bits, behaviors, signatures, ports. Business presents very complex issues that are often involving people (which we can't patch) and that often don't fit nicely into blanket rules. Even if we turned away from technical solutions and devoted our time into solving these problems, they are still not going to be neatly solved. Likewise, when push comes to shove, can you have and meet goals with firewalls? Can you show improvement? All of this flows from the rather subjective non-technical aspect of those issues. Sort of the difference between a child's report card and the feedback you get from a parent-teacher conference. If you have a child, which one would you be most inclined to disagree with or not necessarily believe? (The answer is the subjective one!)<br/><br/>It could be said this is the natural progression of security and technology: from shoring up the technical controls to moving up the stack towards behavior and people. Sure, these 3 top concerns can be said to punch through firewalls and network segments, but that's the nature of those things (social media "punching" through a firewall is far different than me punching through an SSH connection to bridge my home network; social media is akin to the *way* I use my SSH connection after the hold is already punched because it is needed; i.e. social media is the way port 80 is used.)<br/><br/>Basically, all indications point to not being surprised by this dichotomy. And I don't think this is some further indication that IT/security is doing it wrong, or isn't aligned properly with business, or has a technical dark-server-room background. I'm not saying we're doing things right or we're properly aligned, but the above isn't a good argument to support the theory of those deficiencies.<br/><br/>Now for a really big jump. I'd liken the current increase in mobile computing to be as big as the introduction of computers into the business and later the PC/internet into business. Now, I wasn't around when the former happened, nor was I in the industry when the personal computer revolution swept into business, but I would bet that is the closest comparison so far. I may even say the same for social media. These are damned new and they're big changes beyond just bringing in Macs or new software or some new business process. | Ma ei ole üllatunud selle ebakõla. Tegelikult, ma isegi minna nii kaugele, et öelda, et see ei ole midagi, mis kunagi muutub, ja me ei tohiks saada kõik aurutatud muutes seda. Kümne aasta pärast on meil ikka veel verejooksud, keerulised teemad suurimate murede nimekirjas ja asjad, mida me lõpuks mõistame, on meie kulutuste peamised osad.<br/><br/>Gunnaril ja Andyl on mõlemad suurepärased punktid, eriti IT-meeskondade kohta, kes näevad IT-probleeme ja lahendavad neid IT-lahendustega; tegelikult olen ma kindel, et nende punktid on väärtuslikud.<br/><br/>Aga ma arvan, et on ka teisi ideid, mis trump neid (ma kommenteerisin oma blogid, ja hiljem otsustasin, et ma peaksin lihtsalt blogi siin). Need top 3 mured on veritsevalt uus selline, et:<br/><br/>Me kardame uusi asju, sest me ei saa neist aru, või me ei saa neist aru, sest nad on uued.<br/><br/>Nad on meile liiga uued, et omada kindlaid lähenemisviise nende käsitlemiseks.<br/><br/>Nad on meile liiga uued, et teada, kas me peaksime muretsema või mitte! me kipume vaikimisi paranoiliseks / murelikuks, mis on hea!<br/><br/>liiga uus, et neile selgeid eelarvepunkte eraldada. Kas ma saan osta kasti või mõnda tarkvara, mis pakub "pilve turvalisust" või "sotsiaalmeedia turvalisust"?<br/><br/>nad on nii uued, et äri ei tea isegi, kuidas neid kasutada või mida nad neist tahavad. Rääkimata sellest, kuidas me saame neid kindlustada, kui me ikka veel kohtume või vähemalt ei löö kogu ärivajadusi. Kui ettevõte isegi ei tea, kuidas neid veel kasutada, ei ole ma kindel, et turvalisus on igas olukorras, et seda ohutult kasutada.<br/><br/>Samuti tuleb mainida, et need uued asjad on suures osas surutakse läbi tarbemaa ja äri, kus IT on omamoodi, "Oh jah," mõtlesin. Tulemüürid, AV, AM, Auth on kõik IT vastused tüüpiline IT küsimusi. Muidugi on seal erinevus. Nad on ka väga subjektiivsed küsimused, erinevalt väga objektiivsetest esemetest, nagu tulemüürid, tuntud pahatahtlikud bitid, käitumine, allkirjad, pordid. Äri esitab väga keerulisi küsimusi, mis hõlmavad sageli inimesi (mida me ei saa paika panna) ja mis sageli ei sobi hästi üldreeglitega. Isegi kui me pöördume tehnilistest lahendustest eemale ja pühendame oma aega nende probleemide lahendamisele, ei lahenda neid ikka veel korralikult. Samamoodi, kui push tuleb tõukama, kas teil on ja täidate eesmärke tulemüüridega? Kas saate näidata paranemist? Kõik see tuleneb nende küsimuste üsna subjektiivsest mittetehnilisest aspektist. Mingi erinevus lapse aruandekaardi ja vanema-õpetaja konverentsilt saadud tagasiside vahel. Kui sul on laps, siis kumba sa kõige rohkem ei usuks või ei usuks? (Vastus on subjektiivne!)<br/><br/>Võib öelda, et see on turvalisuse ja tehnoloogia loomulik progress: tehnilise kontrolli suurendamisest kuni virna ülespoole liikumiseni käitumise ja inimeste suunas. Muidugi, need 3 peamist muret võib öelda, et lüüa läbi tulemüüride ja võrgusegmentide, kuid see on nende asjade olemus (sotsiaalne meedia "läbib" läbi tulemüüri on palju erinev kui mina, kes lööb läbi SSH-ühenduse, et silduda oma koduvõrku; sotsiaalne meedia on sarnane * viisil * ma kasutan oma SSH-ühendust pärast seda, kui ooteaeg on juba läbi löödud; st.<br/><br/>Põhimõtteliselt viitavad kõik märgid sellele, et seda dihhotoomiat ei üllata. Ja ma ei usu, et see on veel üks märk sellest, et IT / turvalisus teeb seda valesti või ei ole korralikult kooskõlastatud äriga või on tehniline tumeserveri-ruumi taust. Ma ei ütle, et me teeme asju õigesti või oleme õigesti joondatud, kuid ülaltoodud ei ole hea argument nende puuduste teooria toetamiseks.<br/><br/>Nüüd tõeliselt suure hüppe jaoks. Ma arvan, et mobiilarvutite praegune kasv on sama suur kui arvutite kasutuselevõtt ettevõtluses ja hiljem PC / Internet ettevõtluses. Nüüd, ma ei olnud ümber, kui esimene juhtus, ja ma ei olnud tööstuses, kui personaalarvuti revolutsiooni pühkis äri, kuid ma vean kihla, et see on lähim võrdlus siiani. Ma võin isegi öelda sama sotsiaalmeedias. Need on neetud uued ja need on suured muutused peale lihtsalt Macide või uue tarkvara või mõne uue äriprotsessi sissetoomise. |
