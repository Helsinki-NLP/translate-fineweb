| Truly Handsfree Bluetooth Headset Takes Voice Commands<br/><br/>Most Bluetooth headsets are perfectly capable of the voice dial thing, assuming that the connected mobile phone can do it, but the BlueAnt V1 takes voice control to a new high. The incredibly compact Bluetooth headset is being marketed as the first ever with a true voice-based user interface.<br/><br/>Instead of clicking a physical button to answer your calls, you simply speak into the microphone and say "accept call". Other basic voice commands could include "volume up", "reject call", or "do the laundry". Okay, maybe it won't do that last thing, but you can see how a completely handsfree experience like that offered by the BlueAnt V1 can be excellent for drivers and other people who need their hands. That is why you're using a Bluetooth headset in the first place.<br/><br/>The downside is that the voice control can be "wonky" and it can be quite frustrating when you accidentally give it a command that you don't want it to do. What happens if you're in a call with someone and you happens to say "end call"? | Tõeliselt käed-vabad Bluetooth-peakomplekt võtab häälkäsklused<br/><br/>Enamik Bluetooth-kõrvaklapid on täiesti võimeline häälvalija asi, eeldades, et ühendatud mobiiltelefoni saab seda teha, kuid BlueAnt V1 võtab hääljuhtimise uuele kõrgusele. Uskumatult kompaktset Bluetooth-peakomplekti turustatakse esimesena, millel on tõeline häälpõhine kasutajaliides.<br/><br/>Selle asemel, et klõpsata füüsilist nuppu kõnedele vastamiseks, räägite lihtsalt mikrofoni ja ütlete "kõne vastuvõtmine". Muud põhilised häälkäsklused võivad sisaldada "koguda", "kõne tagasilükkamine" või "pesu pesemine". Okei, võib-olla see ei tee seda viimast asja, kuid näete, kuidas täiesti käed-vaba kogemus, mida pakub BlueAnt V1, võib olla suurepärane juhtidele ja teistele inimestele, kes vajavad oma käsi. See on põhjus, miks te kasutate Bluetooth-peakomplekti.<br/><br/>Negatiivne külg on see, et hääljuhtimine võib olla "rõve" ja see võib olla üsna masendav, kui annate sellele kogemata käsu, mida te ei soovi. Mis juhtub, kui olete kellegagi kõnes ja ütlete "lõppkõne"? |
| Wednesday, July 06, 2005<br/><br/>Going to college? DREAM on<br/><br/>Here is another great article about our failing (and increasingly ridiculous) immigration system, this time from the Boston Globe. A 18-year undocumented immigrant from Massachusetts was awarded a four-year scholarship at any state university because of her high test scores, but this was later rescinded once state officials found out about her immigration status. As the author of the article so rightly says,<br/><br/>"So much for celebrating the building blocks for success and the American dream. Romney says, tough luck if you are smart, hardworking, and the child of illegal immigrants."<br/><br/>It's beyond me why anyone wants to keep smart, high-achieving kids like this one out of college. Does anybody really think that denying in-state tuition and scholarships to undocumented immigrants will make any potential immigrants think twice about coming here to work? Or are policies like these motivated by fear? Despite the increasingly widespread movement in favor of the DREAM Act and state laws (see this previous post) to allow undocumented students to pay in-state tuition, it seems like the power of fear is growing.<br/><br/>It's interesting that Mass. Gov. Romney is bashing undocumented immigrants now - this article in the Economist shows how his campaign to end gay marriage in Massachusetts is closely linked to his anticipated run for the presidency in 2008. Here in New York, presumed Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton has gone to the right on immigration, claiming that she is "adamantly against illegal immigrants." It's unfortunate that the way to get ahead in politics (particularly in the red states) is to blame immigrants for our problems. It will be interesting to see if an increased Latino turnout in places like the Southwest will prove Hillary wrong.<br/><br/>3 comments:<br/><br/>Maybe people do not want illegal aliens to get scholarhips for the following reasons:<br/><br/>1. Their parents violated the law to enter the country. 2. Their parents had to steal someone's identity to work in this country. 3. Their parents have to cheat on their income taxes (and other taxes) to stay here. 4. Their parents had to lie to get their children admitted. 5. their parents lied on applications for things like free lunch.<br/><br/>First, the Supreme Court ruled in 1982 that all children have the right to public education regardless of immigration status. Schools are prohibited from asking about a child's immigration status, meaning that undocumented parents do not have to "lie" to get their kids free lunch.<br/><br/>Second, many immigrants do not have to use another identity or cheat on income taxes in order to work here -- many employers knowingly hire undocumented immigrants (this has been happening for some time - the 1986 Imm. Reform and Control Act's attempted to deal with it, and many anti-immigrant advocates argue that employer sanctions need to be strengthened today) and quite a few immigrants pay income taxes and other taxes that they never end up receiving the benefits of (the New York Times reported that illegal immigrants provide social security with a subsidy of $7 billion a year).<br/><br/>Finally, if the biggest problem with undocumented immigrants is that they are breaking the law by being here, should that same standard be applied to businesses that knowingly hire them (which, by the way, is also against the law even though it is rarely enforced)? Should the kids of these businesspeople be denied the same opportunities because their parents broke the law? Could we extend this argument to the children of everyone who has ever broken the law in this country?<br/><br/>Whatever you think about illegal immigration, the point is that the kids should not be punished for their parents' decisions to come here. Especially when these bright and hardworking undocumented students have the potential to contribute so much to our society. | Kolmapäev, Juuli 06, 2005<br/><br/>Lähed kolledžisse? Unista edasi<br/><br/>Siin on veel üks suurepärane artikkel meie ebaõnnestunud (ja üha naeruväärsema) sisserändesüsteemi kohta, seekord Boston Globe'ist. 18-aastane dokumenteerimata immigrant Massachusettsist sai nelja-aastase stipendiumi mis tahes riiklikus ülikoolis tema kõrgete testitulemuste tõttu, kuid see tühistati hiljem, kui riigiametnikud said teada tema sisserände staatusest. Nagu artikli autor õigustatult ütleb:<br/><br/>"Nii palju tähistada ehitusplokkide edu ja Ameerika unistus. Romney ütleb, halb õnn, kui sa oled tark, töökas, ja laps ebaseaduslike sisserändajate."<br/><br/>Ma ei mõista, miks keegi tahab selliseid nutikaid, edukaid lapsi kolledþist eemal hoida. Kas keegi tõesti arvab, et dokumentideta immigrantidele riigi õppe- ja stipendiumide andmisest keeldumine paneb võimalikud immigrandid kaks korda mõtlema, kas nad tulevad siia tööle? Või on sellised poliitikad motiveeritud hirmust? Vaatamata üha laialdasemale liikumisele DREAM seaduse ja riigi seaduste kasuks (vt seda eelmist postitust), et võimaldada dokumentideta õpilastel maksta riigi õppemaksu, tundub, et hirmu jõud kasvab.<br/><br/>On huvitav, et Mass. Gov. Romney lööb dokumenteerimata immigrante nüüd - see artikkel Economist näitab, kuidas tema kampaania lõpetada homoabielu Massachusettsis on tihedalt seotud tema eeldatava presidendivalimisega 2008. aastal. Siin New Yorgis on väidetav demokraatide juht Hillary Clinton läinud sisserände küsimuses paremale, väites, et ta on "ebaseaduslikult ebaseaduslike sisserändajate vastu". On kahetsusväärne, et viis poliitikas (eriti punastes osariikides) edasi minna on süüdistada sisserändajaid meie probleemides. Huvitav on näha, kas suurenenud Ladina-osalus sellistes kohtades nagu Edela-Hillary eksib.<br/><br/>3 kommentaari:<br/><br/>Võib-olla inimesed ei taha ebaseaduslike välismaalaste saada stipendiume järgmistel põhjustel:<br/><br/>1. Nende vanemad rikkusid riiki sisenemiseks seadust. 2. Nende vanemad pidid varastama kellegi identiteedi, et selles riigis töötada. 3. Nende vanemad peavad petma oma tulumaksu (ja muid makse), et siia jääda. 4. Nende vanemad pidid oma laste vastuvõtmiseks valetama. 5. nende vanemad valetasid selliste asjade taotluste kohta nagu tasuta lõunasöök.<br/><br/>Esiteks otsustas Riigikohus 1982. aastal, et kõigil lastel on õigus avalikule haridusele, sõltumata sisserände staatusest. Koolidel on keelatud küsida lapse sisserände staatust, mis tähendab, et dokumenteerimata vanemad ei pea oma lastele tasuta lõunasöögi saamiseks "valetama".<br/><br/>Teiseks, paljud sisserändajad ei pea siin töötamiseks kasutama teist identiteeti või petma tulumaksu - paljud tööandjad palkavad teadlikult dokumenteerimata sisserändajaid (see on juba mõnda aega juhtunud - 1986 Imm. Reformi- ja kontrolliseadus püüdis sellega tegeleda ning paljud sisserändajatevastased advokaadid väidavad, et tööandja sanktsioone tuleb täna tugevdada) ja üsna vähe sisserändajaid maksavad tulumaksu ja muid makse, mida nad kunagi ei saa (New York Times teatas, et ebaseaduslikud sisserändajad pakuvad sotsiaalkindlustustoetust 7 miljardit dollarit aastas).<br/><br/>Lõpetuseks, kui suurim probleem dokumentideta sisserändajatega on see, et nad rikuvad seadust, kui nad on siin, kas sama standardit tuleks kohaldada ettevõtetele, kes neid teadlikult palkavad (mis muide on ka seadusega vastuolus, kuigi seda rakendatakse harva)? Kas nende ärimeeste lastele tuleks keelata samad võimalused, sest nende vanemad rikkusid seadust? Kas me saaksime seda argumenti laiendada kõigi nende lastele, kes on kunagi selles riigis seadust rikkunud?<br/><br/>Ükskõik, mida te arvate ebaseaduslikust sisserändest, mõte on selles, et lapsi ei tohiks karistada vanemate otsuste eest siia tulla. Eriti siis, kui need säravad ja töökad dokumenteerimata õpilased saavad meie ühiskonnale nii palju kaasa aidata. |

| ΑΛΗΘΩΣ<br/><br/>Corporations are not people and money is not speech<br/><br/>In Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned century-old restrictions on corporate spending in elections under the guise of protecting First Amendment free speech rights. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, writing for the majority, said, "If the First Amendment has any force, it prohibits Congress from fining or jailing citizens, or associations of citizens, for simply engaging in political speech." This argument of the majority decision rests on the notions that corporations are covered by the same free speech protections as individual citizens and that campaign donations or financing are the same as speech.<br/><br/>Corporations, however, are inherently not the same as individuals and thus cannot have the same protections as individuals. There are a slew of laws that protect corporations and their interests in the arena for which they are by definition formed—namely the marketplace. The laws that govern corporations and the rights enjoyed by them are distinct from the laws and rights of individuals. A corporation, for example, can enter into contracts like an individual, but unlike an individual, a corporation's members can be protected by limited liability so their personal assets are not at stake.<br/><br/>If a corporation, then, is a distinct legal entity governed by different laws than an individual is, corporations are not protected under the First Amendment in the same way that individuals are protected. Corporations, especially in their most powerful and wealthy incarnations, are exponentially more influential than most individuals in America. The restrictions on corporate spending in elections that were overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court were meant to redress this power balance between average individuals and unduly influential businesses. Corporations already have a plethora of ways to influence politics, from political action committees to lobbyists on Capitol Hill. The framers of the Bill of Rights wanted to protect the voices of the trampled, not amplify the voices of the elite.<br/><br/>The other part of the Supreme Court's premise for its decision is that the First Amendment free speech clause applies to campaign funding. While speech can be interpreted loosely as any form of expression, such an open, ambiguous definition would create a myriad of problems with all kinds of laws. An architect has a vision of a building: it is his art, his self expression, yet he cannot ignore local zoning laws that, for instance, restrict the height of his building. Should he sue the state for violation of his free speech, his right to expression? Equating money with speech also opens the door to sundry ludicrous claims by, for instance, an employer who objects to minimum wage laws since he'd like to express that his employees are only worth paying $3 an hour. There have to be restrictions on what constitutes speech to prevent a bastardization of the term and an overly liberal interpretation of the First Amendment.<br/><br/>A corporation already has the power to issue a statement in favor of a candidate or policy through its political action committees, and individual members of a business are welcome to contribute money as well. However, allowing a corporation to use its vast profits to directly finance the election or to remove a candidate compromises the democratic notion of a free and fair election. There are unseemly ties even now between politicians and various industries, but this new ruling would make such connections more robust and give them a veneer of legitimacy. A politician financed by a business would become completely beholden to its political agenda and not to the voters.<br/><br/>It's not only the independence of politicians that's at stake, but also the independence of our judges, who are at the very least expected to be impartial. Many states still use elections to appoint judges, which leaves them vulnerable to the influence of political spending. In a recent speech at a law school conference, former Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor worried about the impact of corporate campaign funding in judicial elections, saying that "judicial campaigning makes last week's decision in Citizens United an increasing problem for maintaining an independent judiciary."<br/><br/>Two cornerstones of our democracy—free elections and an independent judiciary—are threatened by the Supreme Court's activist and meddling decision. The case could have been decided much more narrowly in favor of Citizens United, but instead, the majority of the justices decided to expand the case to champion the rights of big money over the interest of the American people. Senators Dick Durbin (D-IL) and Arlen Specter (D-PA) introduced the Fair Elections Now Act last March. It would prohibit contributions from political action committees and would match individual donations, limited to $100, on a 4:1 basis so that fundraising focuses on the people. Such a system has been in place in New York City since the 1988 Campaign Finance Act. The rest of the country is long overdue to follow. Never before has the fight for public financing been more necessary.<br/><br/>The author is a Columbia College junior majoring in political science. She is a prospective law student.<br/><br/>The 14th amendment, which was one of the Reconstruction amendments added following the War of Northern Aggression was never legally ratified by the States and has caused more problems than all the other post-war amendments combined. If my memory serves me right, corporations were declared by the Supreme Court to be 14th Amemdment citizens during the late 1800s or early 1900s. In case you are unfamiliar with the wording of this amendment, it basically made everyone a citizen (and subject) of the United States. Prior to the War, all individuals were citizens of the State within which they resided and no one was a citizen of the United States nor were they subject to the jurisdiction of the United States except for those who resided in the District of Columbia or resided within one of the territories under the jurisdiction of the United States. The main purposes of the War of Northern Aggression was to destroy the soverienty of the individual States and reduce the status of every American to that of a subject under the control and jurisdiction of the United States government. The founding fathers set up our government as a loose confederation of Sovereign States with the States exercising all meaningful polical power. They never invisioned or intended any effective political power to reside in Washington. Things will only get much worse until We the People throw the theives and money changers out of Washington and restore our government back to what it once was.<br/><br/>The word person means corporation in law. It is not that corporations are not people, it is that people are not corporations. We have been tricked into accepting a corporate identity[ALL CAPS]. Look at your drivers license. Every time we go to court,we go as a corporation, not as a natural person.The first corporations were governments. Looked at logically, limited liability for a corporation is the extension of sovereign immunity to the king after he was no longer king. The same ruling elite families are still in control and that goes all the way back to the first known about extraterrestrials[anunaki] that the Sumerian documents talk about.The same group also take the credit or blame for all the religions and secret societies.<br/><br/>What difference does it make? Really. Think about it, the whole entire Congress and Senate are a dog and pony show, the real power brokers who control it all are in the shadows, working the deals, doing what they want, with the AL-CIA-DA and MOSSAD out there killing everyone who disagrees with these shadow government assholes who truly run it all.<br/><br/>So, why is it so important now to be so upset over this shit? Why now? After more than two hundred years of absolute proof that the politicians are just a fancy hand puppet show to distract us from the REAL WHEELING AND DEALING IN THE BACK ROOMS elsewhere, why does it matter now that the total contempt of democracy is being demonstrated by SCOTUS in this ruling? The assholes on this court know that the real guys with their hands on the power levers of the system aren't in the Congress and the Senate.<br/><br/>When the Rule of Law became OBSOLETE in the world, in general, and everything became more or less ROLLERBALL only this time, on STEROIDS, for and by the CORPORATIONS, why did this sole ruling make all that much difference? Why do all of you assholes think that this 'lagging' indicator of the end of any semblances of democratic government makes any difference.<br/><br/>Hypothetically, let's say this ruling had not happened. Do any of you think that the corporations and the moneyed influences in the shadows wouldn't have continued to exert any and all of their will on the rest of us?<br/><br/>For those of you who think it'd been different, I suggest you find a remedy to your TOTAL NAIVETE!!!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>this ruling didn't make one iota of a difference. It was always like this, long before SCOTUS basically said to corporations; "go ahead, do what the fuck you want…the little people are just cannon fodder for your wars, chattel for you to barter and sell at your leisure.."<br/><br/>democracy was always an illusion. We never ever had any control, ever. making such a mountain out of this mole hill is absolutely unwarranted, in light of the fact that for the whole entire 230 year history of this republic, the fat cats and the rich oligarchs never needed any Congress or Senate to do what they pleased, under any circumstances, ever. They just did it.<br/><br/>The government you were looking at was a chimera, not real..<br/><br/>the sooner you all come to that realization, the sooner we can get on with less pissing and moaning over a mere joke of a technicality that was always the case from day one, and was not foisted on us by the SCOTUS, the court only quite belatedly declared to us what has been happening for a long long long, corrupt time.<br/><br/>I've got a mad crush on Exxon, and Exxon has one on me, wedding bells in the spring – a bit quick I know, but our love can't be denied. Exxon is a little shy, so don't expect any public announcements, we're thinking a quiet wedding in Reno.<br/><br/>Any business is simply a group of individuals (small or large) exercising their individual rights collectively. Therefore, any business has the same rights as those individuals (except, of course, the right to vote, which is reserved to the individuals themselves). The freedom to dispose of one's wealth as one sees fit comes along with the freedom to earn it. If an aggregate of individuals has earned money, it should be free to decide how do dispose of that money. The real problem is not that businesses can donate to campaigns, it is that the government has been allowed to meddle in business – i.e. that the government can grant some favor in return for that money. We need separation of commerce and state in the same way and for the same reasons as we have separation of church and state. I also find it interesting that the author chose as examples two laws (zoning and minimum wage) that also violate individual rights. The first violates property rights and the second violates the rights of individuals to contract freely.<br/><br/>under your jackoffian analysis, nobody should interfere with anything anyone does at all. say, if I were in a crowd, with a saturday night special, and I want to 'free speech' your butt with it much in the same way the CIA free speeched Bobby Kennedy in L.A. one night, that's fine, because to interfere with me is interfering with my right to free speech you.<br/><br/>that's the critical flaw with you libertarian assholes….you think that there is no societal role for any rule of law, that anything that fits under 'ends justify means' rationale shouldn't ever be interfered with, just let everyone do whatever they so choose, and it all works out. That Ayn Rand bullshit doesn't work, dude! It works right up to the point where someone else pays a price for your 'whatever i wanna do' freedom crosses a line and then interfere with my freedom.<br/><br/>rules and laws SHOULD exist in the framework of society strictly to keep in check that good old "I can do anything I want to and it's just me being free" line of horse shit.<br/><br/>Corporations do not have any rights, dorkus! globally, they have been the reason why there are so many failed states, pillaged by the will of corporatocrats based in the U.S.S.A. who think that freedom of their speech translates into; "do what we tell you or we'll bomb you to get your resources we need" kind of raping and pillaging.<br/><br/>someday, I hope some asshole fucks you with their 'free speech' and then we'll hear your sorry ass whine about how the law let you down. What law? In your libertarian world of 'I can do what I want', the only rule of law is the one you make up to justify your end goal. For you then, it'll be fun to see how you cope with some other asshole's interpretation of your boundary being just a little bit of a mere inconvenience for his goals, which didn't necessarily respect your boundaries at all, for damned sure!<br/><br/>Someone by the name of "uh huh, right.." might have a logical point hidden in the forest of name-calling and straw-man abuse, but how about this: Corporations are inventions of the State that are created to pass some of the risks of doing business from the people running the business over to the stockholders (if any), the customers (if any) and the public. So if a corporation commits a fraud, it is the corporation that's punished (usually) and fined and the people who run the corporation get to walk away with a golden handshake. And the cost of the fine is passed along to the customers and paid to the government (not the victims!). To "David"s point, if we were to separate government and commerce, corporations would cease to exist! Not a bad idea.<br/><br/>I think that the point is, that if a corporation commits a financial crime, and nobody notices (the if the tree falls in the forest and nobody hears it, did it truly make a noise argument) then did a crime actually take place?<br/><br/>and in a veitch diagram, where the two blobs collide and interact, if one encroaches on the other one's boundary, who is the arbiter of who got violated?<br/><br/>my point is this: there are no straw man arguments with regard to david's asinine assessment that corporations can do whatever they want with abandon. the truth of the matter is, granting corporations, and oligarchs, or whomever, a license to do what they want, whenever they want, under the premise that THEY ARE INDIVIDUALS and hence, guaranteed FREE SPEECH, is both absurd and horse shit.<br/><br/>corporations are made up of groups of people. people who should live by some semblance of Rule of Law. When they don't have to, then it's "I can do anything I want as long as nobody catches me or holds me accountable for my transgressions" going on here.<br/><br/>if that's the world David wants to live in, let him go there and make it happen, but goddamn it, don't expect me not to fucking object to that shit!<br/><br/>We can all get along, just as long as boundaries are not gratuitously violated at will by anyone who thinks their right to do what they want actually nullifies my right not to be interfered with by their actions.<br/><br/>with regard to corporations, they have no right to violate my rights, or yours, or anyone elses. If they can't function in the community as a benevolent and hence, non interfering entity, then they have no right to exist.<br/><br/>and David wasn't being threatened. he's an asshole for asserting that "do what you want, it's freedom of speech" is a bunch of horse shit. It's la la land bullshit. And I object to anyone or anything violating my boundaries with that free speech assertion. That's a crock of shit and you know it is!<br/><br/>Well, that was a colorful response. Sadly, "uh-uh", you are way off the mark. I never said people have the right to infringe on anyone else's rights…and I repudiate "ends justify the means" thinking. Yes, laws SHOULD exist, but ONLY to PROTECT the rights of people. I'm sorry you have such a warped and horribly incorrect view of my argument.<br/><br/>your point well taken, David. I apologize for peeing in your corn flakes. I think I thought you were inferring that corporations were able to do whatever they pleased under this right of FREEDOM OF SPEECH, which in Amerk'a is a joke today because the PATRIOT ACT and a non-declared state of MARTIAL LAW we've been living under since Sept. 2001, has given the government the ability to suspend and or 'shred' the U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights.<br/><br/>sadly, people have only a few rights. we have the right to be taxed to the point of absurdity. we have the right to be conscripted and become cannon fodder for oligarch wars. and we have the right to shut the fuck up and be quiet while we are being joy boinked by corporations and oligarchs and bankers. those are our rights, and sadly, they truly SUCKETH, David. I think we can agree on that!<br/><br/>I'm still wondering how the newbie, Roberts, inherited the Chief Justiceship after Rhenquist rather than that role going to someone with more experience on the bench. What does "The Roberts Court" plan to do next, though, for corporations? Give them the right to vote at the polls like real people?; perhaps have votes by human beings counted as 3/5 of a person or less to their 1?<br/><br/>I haven't read all of the 183-page booklength "ruling" yet but find these appalling statements therein to be not only contradictory to their expansive actions in this case but also something of an abdication of their duty:<br/><br/>"the gravest and most delicate duty that this Court is called upon to perform." Blodgett v. Holden, 275 U. S. 142, 147–148 (1927) (Holmes, J., concurring). Because the stakes are so high, our standard practice is to refrain from addressing constitutional questions except when necessary to rule on particular claims before us. See Ashwander v. TVA, 297 U. S. 288, 346–348 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concur-ring). This policy underlies both our willingness to construe ambiguous statutes to avoid constitutional problems and our practice "'never to formulate a rule of constitutional law broader than is required by the precise facts to which it is to be applied.'" United States v. Raines, 362<br/>U. S. 17, 21 (1960) (quoting Liverpool, New York & Philadelphia S. S. Co. v. Commissioners of Emigration, 113<br/>U. S. 33, 39 (1885)).<br/>The majority and dissent are united in expressing allegiance to these principles. Ante, at 12; post, at 14 (STEVENS, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). >><br/><br/>Roberts, by virtue of his lies during CONfirmation by the DEMS who shoved his lying ass thru the process at mach speed, needs to be 'impeached' for being a fucking liar. He specifically stated he would not go this route of writing decisions not based on settled, non controversial concepts of the U.S. Constitution…and here clearly he has done exactly the opposite of that.<br/><br/>The real blame should be on the shoulders of the cocksuckers in the SENATE that confirmed the son of a bitch in the first place, stating they wouldn't vote against his confirmation because they were saving their ammo for REAL THREATS TO US..<br/><br/>I blame the fucking DINOCRATS more than I blame this lying pile of shit named Roberts.

Just a couple of them holding their ground could have stopped the confirmation of Alito, and then Roberts. But they let it slide.<br/><br/>the assertion that all of this is indeed window dressing is a correct one, and the truth is, though blatantly a violation of our rights across the board, these scum in the SCOTUS are only post fact, asserting the screwing they were doing to us for a long, long, long time.<br/><br/>the truth is, it never mattered what we thought was going on, because Corporations have been functioning well outside the law for a long time now, and nobody has held them accountable. the very bastards that sit on the SCOTUS are benefactors of the wrongdoing and greed of the corporations who provide kickbacks to them for their decisions, in the form of STOCK DIVIDENDS.<br/><br/>unfortunately, focusing on the corrupt SCOTUS doesn't help us much.

Cf. 2 U. S. C. §441e (contribution and expenditure ban applied to "foreign national[s]"). Section 441b is not limited to corporations or associations that were created in foreign countries or funded predominantly by foreign shareholders. Section 441b therefore would be overbroad even if we assumed, arguendo, that the Government has a compelling interest in limiting foreign influence over our political process.

It is now in a yearly bankruptcy rollover. The government is now private like BLACKWATER. All government agencies are listed on DUNN AND BRADSTREET.

We exist by contract with the state. Remember the 14th amendment. There were no US citizens before that. Most of us have unwittingly claimed US corporate citizenship. We need to address the rule by the banking elite.Almost all leading REPS and DEMS are members of the COUNCIL OF FOREIGN RELATIONS or the TLC. LOok up the history of who started and controls these.

Kohtunik Anthony M. Kennedy, kes kirjutas enamusele, ütles: "Kui esimesel parandusel on jõudu, keelab see kongressil kodanike või kodanike ühenduste trahvimine või vangistamine lihtsalt poliitilises kõnes osalemise eest." See enamusotsuse argument põhineb arusaamal, et korporatsioonid on hõlmatud sama sõnavabaduse kaitsega kui üksikisikud ja et kampaania annetused või rahastamine on sama mis kõne.<br/><br/>Korporatsioonid ei ole aga oma olemuselt samad kui üksikisikud ja seega ei saa neil olla samu kaitseid kui üksikisikutel. On hulk seadusi, mis kaitsevad korporatsioone ja nende huve areenil, mille jaoks nad on definitsiooni järgi moodustatud - nimelt turul. Õigusaktid, mis reguleerivad ettevõtteid ja nende õigusi, erinevad üksikisikute seadustest ja õigustest. Näiteks võib ettevõte sõlmida lepinguid nagu üksikisik, kuid erinevalt üksikisikust saab ettevõtte liikmeid kaitsta piiratud vastutusega, nii et nende isiklikud varad ei ole kaalul.<br/><br/>Kui korporatsioon on seega eraldiseisev juriidiline isik, mida reguleerivad erinevad seadused kui üksikisik, ei ole korporatsioonid esimese muudatuse alusel kaitstud samal viisil kui üksikisikud. Ettevõtted, eriti nende kõige võimsamates ja jõukamates kehastustes, on eksponentsiaalselt mõjukamad kui enamik inimesi Ameerikas. Piirangud ettevõtete kulutustele valimistel, mille USA ülemkohus tühistas, olid mõeldud selle võimu tasakaalu parandamiseks keskmiste üksikisikute ja ebamõistlikult mõjukate ettevõtete vahel. Korporatsioonidel on juba palju võimalusi poliitikat mõjutada, alates poliitilistest tegevuskomiteedest kuni Capitol Hilli lobitöötajateni. Õiguste seaduse eelnõu koostajad tahtsid kaitsta jalge alla tallatud hääli, mitte võimendada eliidi hääli.<br/><br/>Teine osa Riigikohtu otsuse eeldusest on see, et esimese muudatuse sõnavabaduse klausel kehtib kampaaniate rahastamisele. Kuigi kõnet võib vabalt tõlgendada mis tahes väljendusvormina, tekitaks selline avatud, mitmetähenduslik määratlus hulgaliselt probleeme igasuguste seadustega. Arhitektil on nägemus hoonest: see on tema kunst, tema eneseväljendus, kuid ta ei saa ignoreerida kohalikke tsoneerimisseadusi, mis näiteks piiravad tema hoone kõrgust. Kas ta peaks kaevama riigile oma sõnavabaduse, väljendusõiguse rikkumise eest? Raha võrdsustamine kõnega avab ukse paljudele naeruväärsetele nõudmistele, näiteks tööandja poolt, kes on vastu miinimumpalga seadustele, kuna ta soovib väljendada, et tema töötajad on väärt ainult 3 dollarit tunnis. Peab olema piirangud sellele, mida kõne endast kujutab, et vältida termini nõmedaks muutmist ja esimese paranduse liiga liberaalset tõlgendamist.<br/><br/>Korporatsioonil on juba volitused väljastada kandidaati või poliitikat toetav avaldus oma poliitilise tegevuse komiteede kaudu ning ettevõtte üksikud liikmed on teretulnud ka raha panustama. Kuid lubades korporatsioonil kasutada oma tohutut kasumit valimiste otseseks rahastamiseks või kandidaadi eemaldamiseks kompromiteerib demokraatlikku vabade ja õiglaste valimiste mõistet. Isegi praegu on poliitikute ja erinevate tööstusharude vahel ebasobivad sidemed, kuid see uus otsus muudaks sellised sidemed tugevamaks ja annaks neile legitiimsuse spooni. Poliitik, keda rahastab ettevõte, jääks täielikult oma poliitilise agenda, mitte valijate võlgu.<br/><br/>Kaalul ei ole mitte ainult poliitikute sõltumatus, vaid ka meie kohtunike sõltumatus, kellelt vähemalt eeldatakse erapooletust. Paljud riigid kasutavad ikka veel valimisi kohtunike ametisse nimetamiseks, mis muudab nad poliitiliste kulutuste mõju suhtes haavatavaks. Endine ülemkohtu kohtunik Sandra Day O'Connor väljendas hiljutises kõnes muret ettevõtete kampaaniate rahastamise mõju pärast kohtuvalimistel, öeldes, et "kohtulik kampaania muudab eelmise nädala otsuse Citizens Unitedis üha suuremaks probleemiks sõltumatu kohtusüsteemi säilitamisel."<br/><br/>Kaks meie demokraatia nurgakivi – vabad valimised ja sõltumatu kohtusüsteem – on ohus ülemkohtu aktivisti ja sekkuva otsuse tõttu. Kohtuasja oleks võinud lahendada palju kitsamalt Citizens Unitedi kasuks, kuid selle asemel otsustas enamik kohtunikke laiendada juhtumit, et kaitsta suurte rahade õigusi Ameerika rahva huvide üle. Senaatorid Dick Durbin (D-IL) ja Arlen Specter (D-PA) tutvustasid märtsis õiglaste valimiste seadust. See keelaks poliitiliste tegevuskomiteede panused ja sobiks individuaalsete annetustega, mis on piiratud 100 dollariga, 4: 1 alusel, nii et raha kogumine keskendub inimestele. Selline süsteem on olnud New Yorgis olemas alates 1988. aasta kampaania rahastamise seadusest. Ülejäänud riik on juba ammu pidanud järgima. Kunagi varem pole võitlus riikliku rahastamise eest olnud vajalikum.<br/><br/>Autor on Columbia kolledži noorem politoloogia erialal. Ta on tulevane õigusteaduse üliõpilane.<br/><br/>14. muudatust, mis oli üks rekonstrueerimismuudatustest, mis lisati pärast Põhja-Agressiooni sõda, ei ratifitseerinud riigid kunagi seaduslikult ja on põhjustanud rohkem probleeme kui kõik teised sõjajärgsed muudatused kokku. Kui mu mälu mind õigesti teenib, kuulutas ülemkohus korporatsioonid 1800. aastate lõpus või 1900. aastate alguses 14. amendmenti kodanikeks. Kui te ei tunne selle muudatusettepaneku sõnastust, tegi see põhimõtteliselt kõik Ameerika Ühendriikide kodanikud (ja subjektid). Enne sõda olid kõik üksikisikud selle riigi kodanikud, kus nad elasid, ja keegi ei olnud Ameerika Ühendriikide kodanik ega allunud Ameerika Ühendriikide jurisdiktsioonile, välja arvatud need, kes elasid Columbia ringkonnas või elasid ühes Ameerika Ühendriikide jurisdiktsiooni all olevatest territooriumidest. Põhjapoolse agressiooni sõja peamine eesmärk oli hävitada üksikute riikide suveräänsus ja vähendada iga ameeriklase staatust Ameerika Ühendriikide valitsuse kontrolli ja jurisdiktsiooni all olevaks subjektiks. Asutajad asutasid meie valitsuse kui suveräänsete riikide lahtise konföderatsiooni, kus riigid kasutavad kogu tähenduslikku poliitilist võimu. Nad ei näinud kunagi ette ega kavatsenud Washingtonis elada tõhusat poliitilist võimu. Asjad lähevad ainult palju hullemaks, kuni meie, rahvas, viskame ühingud ja rahavahetajad Washingtonist välja ja taastame oma valitsuse selliseks, nagu see kunagi oli.<br/><br/>Sõna inimene tähendab ettevõtet seaduses. See ei ole, et ettevõtted ei ole inimesed, see on, et inimesed ei ole ettevõtted. Meid on petnud, et aktsepteerida ettevõtte identiteeti[KÕIK CAPS]. Vaadake oma juhiluba. Iga kord, kui me kohtusse läheme, läheme korporatsioonina, mitte füüsilise isikuna. Esimesed korporatsioonid olid valitsused. Loogiliselt vaadelduna on piiratud vastutus korporatsioonile suveräänse puutumatuse pikendamine kuningale pärast seda, kui ta ei olnud enam kuningas. Samad valitsevad eliitperekonnad on endiselt kontrolli all ja see ulatub tagasi esimesele teadaolevale tulnukate[anunaki] kohta, millest Sumeri dokumendid räägivad. Sama rühm võtab ka kõigi religioonide ja salaseltside au või süü.<br/><br/>Mis vahet sel on? Mõelge sellele, kogu kongress ja senat on koerte ja ponide näitus, tõelised võimumaaklerid, kes seda kõike kontrollivad, on varjudes, teevad tehinguid, teevad seda, mida nad tahavad, koos AL-CIA-DA ja MOSSAD-iga, tappes kõik, kes ei nõustu nende varivalitsuse sitapeadega, kes seda kõike tegelikult juhivad.<br/><br/>Miks on nüüd nii tähtis selle pasa pärast nii ärritunud olla? Pärast enam kui kakssada aastat kestnud absoluutseid tõendeid selle kohta, et poliitikud on lihtsalt väljamõeldud käe nukunäitus, mis tõmbab meid mujalt TÕELISEST RUUMIDES KEERUMISEST JA KASUTAMISEST, miks on nüüd oluline, et SCOTUS demonstreerib selles otsuses demokraatia täielikku põlgust? Selle kohtu sitapead teavad, et tõelised tüübid, kelle käed on süsteemi jõuhoobadel, ei ole Kongressis ega Senatis.<br/><br/>Kui Õigusriik muutus maailmas üldiselt OBSOLEETIliseks ja kõik muutus enam-vähem ROLLERBALLiks ainult seekord, STEROIDIDE, ETTEVÕTJATE JA ETTEVÕTJATE SUHTES, siis miks see ainuke otsus muutis kõik niivõrd palju? Miks te kõik, sitapead, arvate, et see "hilinenud” indikaator demokraatliku valitsuse mis tahes sarnasuste lõppemisest ei muuda midagi.<br/><br/>Hüpoteetiliselt, ütleme, et seda otsust ei juhtunud. Kas keegi teist arvab, et korporatsioonid ja rahalised mõjutused varjudes ei oleks jätkanud meie ülejäänute suhtes oma tahte avaldamist?<br/><br/>Neile, kes arvavad, et see oli erinev, soovitan teil leida oma TOTAL NAIVETE'i ravimeetod!!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>See otsus ei muutnud midagi. See oli alati nii, ammu enne seda, kui SCOTUS põhimõtteliselt korporatsioonidele ütles: "Mine edasi, tee seda, mida kuradit sa tahad ... väikesed inimesed on lihtsalt teie sõdade suurtüki sööt, et saaksite vahetada ja müüa oma vabal ajal."<br/><br/>demokraatia on alati olnud illusioon. Meil ei ole kunagi olnud mingit kontrolli, kunagi. Sellise mäe tegemine sellest moolimäest välja on täiesti põhjendamatu, arvestades asjaolu, et kogu selle vabariigi 230-aastase ajaloo jooksul ei vajanud rasvased kassid ja rikkad oligarhid kunagi kongressi ega senati, et teha seda, mida nad soovisid, mis tahes tingimustel, kunagi. Nad lihtsalt tegid seda.<br/><br/>Valitsus, mida sa vaatasid, oli kimäär, mitte reaalne.<br/><br/>Mida varem te kõik selle mõistmiseni jõuate, seda kiiremini saame vähem pissimist ja oigamist pelgalt tehnilise nalja üle, mis oli alati esimesest päevast alates ja mida SCOTUS meile ei avaldanud, kuulutas kohus meile ainult üsna hilja, mis on toimunud pikka pikka pikka pikka, korrumpeerunud aega.<br/><br/>Ma olen Exxonisse hullult armunud ja Exxonil on üks minust, pulmakellad kevadel - natuke kiire, ma tean, kuid meie armastust ei saa eitada. Exxon on natuke häbelik, nii et ärge oodake avalikke teadaandeid, me mõtleme vaikne pulm Renos.<br/><br/>Iga ettevõte on lihtsalt grupp üksikisikuid (väike või suur), kes teostavad oma individuaalseid õigusi kollektiivselt. Seetõttu on igal ettevõttel samad õigused kui neil isikutel (välja arvatud muidugi hääleõigus, mis on reserveeritud üksikisikutele endile). Vabadus käsutada oma rikkust, kui see sobib, kaasneb vabadusega seda teenida. Kui üksikisikute kogum on teeninud raha, peaks neil olema vabadus otsustada, kuidas seda raha käsutada. Tegelik probleem ei ole selles, et ettevõtted saavad annetada kampaaniatele, vaid selles, et valitsusel on lubatud sekkuda ettevõtlusse – see tähendab, et valitsus võib selle raha vastutasuks anda mõne soosingu. Me vajame kaubanduse ja riigi eraldamist samal viisil ja samadel põhjustel kui meil on kiriku ja riigi eraldamine. Samuti on huvitav, et autor valis näitena kaks seadust (tsoneerimine ja miinimumpalk), mis rikuvad ka üksikisiku õigusi. Esimene rikub omandiõigusi ja teine rikub üksikisikute õigust vabalt lepinguid sõlmida.<br/><br/>Teie jackoffi analüüsi järgi ei tohiks keegi sekkuda millessegi, mida keegi üldse teeb. Ütleme nii, et kui ma oleksin rahvahulgas, laupäevaõhtusel eriüritusel, ja ma tahan "sõnavabadust" teie tagumikku sellega palju samamoodi, nagu CIA sõnavabadust rääkis Bobby Kennedy L.A.-s ühel õhtul, see on hea, sest minusse sekkumine sekkub minu õigusesse sõnavabadust teile.<br/><br/>See on kriitiline viga teiega, libertaarsed sitapead... te arvate, et õigusriigil ei ole mingit ühiskondlikku rolli, et miski, mis sobib "põhjendab tähendab" loogika alla, ei tohiks kunagi sekkuda, lihtsalt laske kõigil teha, mida nad valivad, ja see kõik toimib. See Ayn Randi jama ei tööta, see töötab kuni punktini, kus keegi teine maksab hinda sinu "mida iganes ma tahan teha" vabaduse eest, ületab piiri ja siis sekkub minu vabadusse.<br/><br/>Reeglid ja seadused PEAVAD eksisteerima ühiskonna raamistikus rangelt, et hoida kontrolli all, et vana hea "Ma võin teha kõike, mida ma tahan ja see on lihtsalt mina olen vaba" rida hobune sitt.<br/><br/>Korporatsioonidel pole mingeid õigusi, dorkus! Globaalselt on nad olnud põhjuseks, miks on nii palju ebaõnnestunud riike, mida rüüstavad USA-s asuvate korporatokraatide tahe, kes arvavad, et nende sõnavabadus tõlgib; "tee seda, mida me teile ütleme, või me pommitame teid, et saada oma ressursid, mida me vajame" omamoodi vägistamine ja rüüstamine.<br/><br/>Ühel päeval, ma loodan, et mõni sitapea kepib sind oma "sõnavabadusega" ja siis me kuuleme su haletsusväärset vingumist selle üle, kuidas seadus sind alt vedas. Teie libertaarses maailmas, kus ma võin teha, mida ma tahan, on ainus õigusriik see, mille te loote, et õigustada oma lõppeesmärki. Sinu jaoks siis, see on lõbus näha, kuidas sa hakkama mõne teise sitapea tõlgendust oma piiri on lihtsalt natuke lihtsalt ebamugavust oma eesmärke, mis ei pruugi austada oma piire üldse, kuradi kindel!<br/><br/>Kellelgi, kelle nimi on "uh huh, õigus.", võib olla loogiline punkt, mis on peidetud nimede kutsumise ja kõrreliste väärkohtlemise metsas, kuid kuidas on see: korporatsioonid on riigi leiutised, mis on loodud selleks, et anda mõned äritegevuse riskid üle ettevõtte juhtidele (kui üldse), klientidele (kui üldse) ja avalikkusele. Nii et kui korporatsioon paneb toime pettuse, on see korporatsioon, mida (tavaliselt) karistatakse ja trahvitakse ning inimesed, kes korporatsiooni juhivad, saavad kuldse käepigistuse. Ja trahvi maksumus antakse edasi klientidele ja makstakse valitsusele (mitte ohvritele!). "Davidi" punkti kohta, kui me eraldaksime valitsuse ja kaubanduse, lõpetaksid korporatsioonid! Pole paha mõte.<br/><br/>Ma arvan, et asi on selles, et kui korporatsioon paneb toime finantskuriteo ja keegi ei märka (kui puu kukub metsa ja keegi ei kuule seda, kas see tõesti tegi müra argumendi), siis kas kuritegu tegelikult toimus?<br/><br/>ja Veichi diagrammil, kus kaks laiku põrkuvad ja suhtlevad, kui üks tungib teise piirile, kes on vahekohtunik, keda rikuti?<br/><br/>Ma tahan öelda, et ei ole mingeid õlgmeeste argumente Davidi asinine hinnangu kohta, et korporatsioonid võivad teha, mida iganes nad tahavad, loobudes. Tõde on see, et korporatsioonidele ja oligarhidele või kellele iganes antakse luba teha seda, mida nad tahavad, millal iganes nad tahavad, eeldusel, et nad on üksikisikud ja seega garanteeritud vaba kõne, on nii absurdne kui ka hobuse sitt.<br/><br/>korporatsioonid koosnevad inimrühmadest. inimesed, kes peaksid elama mõne õigusriigi sarnasuse järgi. Kui nad ei pea, siis on see "Ma võin teha kõike, mida ma tahan, kui keegi ei saa mind kätte ega võta mind vastutusele minu üleastumiste eest" siin toimub.<br/><br/>Kui David tahab sellises maailmas elada, siis las ta läheb sinna ja paneb selle juhtuma, aga kurat võtaks, ära oota, et ma sellele vastu ei oleks!<br/><br/>Me kõik saame läbi, niikaua kui keegi, kes arvab, et tal on õigus teha seda, mida ta tahab, ei riku oma tahtmist tasuta, tühistab minu õiguse mitte sekkuda nende tegudesse.<br/><br/>Mis puutub korporatsioonidesse, siis neil ei ole õigust rikkuda minu, sinu või kellegi teise õigusi. Kui nad ei saa kogukonnas toimida heatahtliku ja seega mittesekkuva üksusena, siis neil ei ole õigust eksisteerida.<br/><br/>ja Davidit ei ähvardatud. Ta on sitapea, kes väidab, et "tee, mida tahad, see on sõnavabadus" on hunnik hobuse sitta. See on la la land jama. Ja ma olen vastu sellele, et keegi või miski rikub minu piire selle sõnavabaduse väitega. See on jama ja sa tead, et see on!<br/><br/>Noh, see oli värvikas vastus. Kahjuks, "uh-uh, sa oled kaugel märgist. Ma ei ole kunagi öelnud, et inimestel on õigus rikkuda kellegi teise õigusi ... ja ma eitan "lõpud õigustavad vahendeid" mõtlemist. Jah, seadused PEAVAD olemas olema, kuid ainult selleks, et kaitsta inimeste õigusi. Mul on kahju, et teil on nii moonutatud ja kohutavalt vale arusaam minu argumendist.<br/><br/>David, ma vabandan, et su maisihelvestesse pissisin. Ma arvan, et ma arvasin, et te järeldate, et korporatsioonid on võimelised tegema kõike, mida nad soovivad selle õiguse alusel rääkida vabadust, mis Amerk'a on nalja täna, sest isamaa seadus ja deklareerimata riik MATTIAALNE ÕIGUS, mida me oleme elanud alates 2001. aasta septembrist, on andnud valitsusele võimaluse peatada ja või "lõigata" USA põhiseaduse ja seaduseelnõu.<br/><br/>Kahjuks on inimestel vähe õigusi. meil on õigus olla absurdselt maksustatud. meil on õigus olla värvatud ja muutuda oligarhide sõdade kahurisöödaks. ja meil on õigus vaikida ja vaikida, samal ajal kui meid rõõmustavad korporatsioonid ja oligarhid ja pankurid. Need on meie õigused, ja kahjuks on nad tõeliselt õnnelikud, David. Ma arvan, et me võime selles kokku leppida!<br/><br/>Ma ikka ei tea, kuidas uustulnuk, Roberts, pärinud Chief Justice pärast Rhenquist asemel, et rolli läheb keegi rohkem kogemusi pink. Mida "Roberts Court" plaanib teha järgmisena, kuigi, korporatsioonid? Andke neile õigus hääletada valimistel nagu reaalsed inimesed; võib-olla on inimeste hääled arvestatud 3/5 inimesest või vähem kui nende 1?<br/><br/>Ma ei ole veel lugenud kõiki 183-leheküljelisi raamatuid, mis "valitsevad", kuid leian, et need kohutavad avaldused ei ole mitte ainult vastuolus nende ekspansiivse tegevusega antud juhul, vaid ka nende kohustusest loobumisega:<br/><br/>Blodgett v.

Vt Ashwander vs. käibemaks, 297 U. S. 288, 346–348 (1936) (Brandeis, J., nõus-ring). See poliitika on aluseks nii meie valmisolekule tõlgendada ebaselgeid põhikirju, et vältida põhiseaduslikke probleeme, kui ka meie praktikale "mitte kunagi sõnastada põhiseadusliku õiguse reeglit laiemalt, kui seda nõuavad täpsed faktid, mille suhtes seda kohaldatakse".

Ta märkis konkreetselt, et ta ei läheks seda teed otsuste kirjutamiseks, mis ei põhine USA põhiseaduse väljakujunenud, mitte vastuolulistel kontseptsioonidel ... ja siin on ta selgelt teinud täpselt vastupidist.<br/><br/>Tõeline süü peaks olema senati türaimejate õlgadel, kes kinnitasid litapoega esiteks, väites, et nad ei hääletaks tema kinnituse vastu, sest nad säästavad oma laskemoona REAL ähvarduseks meile.<br/><br/>Ma süüdistan rohkem Dinokraate kui seda valelikku pasahunnikut nimega Roberts, selliseid jobusid nagu SCHUMER ja see teine sitapea Illinoisist ja seda valelikku sionistlikku tõbrast Levini Michiganist. Ainult paar neist, kes oma maad hoidsid, oleksid võinud peatada Alito ja Robertsi kinnituse, aga nad lasid sel libiseda.<br/><br/>väide, et kõik see on tõepoolest aknakate, on õige, ja tõde on see, et kuigi meie õiguste rikkumine on kogu pardal, on need SCOTUSi rämps ainult post fakt, väites, et nad tegid meile pikka, pikka, pikka aega.<br/><br/>Tõde on see, et pole kunagi olnud oluline, mis meie arvates toimub, sest korporatsioonid on tegutsenud hästi väljaspool seadust juba pikka aega ja keegi ei ole neid vastutusele võtnud. SCOTUSel istuvad värdjad on ettevõtete väärtegude ja ahnuse heategijad, kes annavad neile oma otsuste eest tagasilöögi aktsiate dividendide kujul.<br/><br/>kahjuks, keskendudes korrumpeerunud SCOTUS ei aita meid palju. See on nagu ilmselge, ja eeldades, et see on karistatav, kui see ei ole.<br/><br/>Me oleme perses, ükskõik, kuidas me seda vaatame, aga tuleb lepituspäev, kui nad võtavad ära kogu keskklassi isikliku väärikuse viimasedki jäänused selles riigis, tuleb põrgu, mille eest maksta. Tuleb vägivaldne, verine tagasilöök, mille sarnast on nähtud ainult Prantsusmaal, kuid lõpuks tuleb ta koju, et siin elada.<br/><br/>Kommunistid on juba pikka aega tegelenud klassisõja õhutamisega majanduslikel liinidel ja sulgudes. Püüdke mõelda rohkem konstitutsioonilise klassi kui "keskklassi", nagu nende keeleteadlased eelistavad. See töötab paremini, imo, et neid nende mänguplaanidest välja visata.<br/><br/>See, mis praegu toimub, on Lambakoerte kiirenemine arusaamises, et midagi on tõsiselt valesti ja et fassaad ja illusioon kannavad õhukest ja langevad alla, paljastades inetu, mitu kombitsat Rothschildi koletise korporatokraatia taga, et rohkem võimu ja absoluutset reeglit.<br/><br/>Kui "keskklass" või kuidas iganes sa seda nimetada tahad, hävitatakse ja hävitatakse üha enam, siis lõpuks on piisavalt Sheeple ärganud punkti, kus nad mõistavad, et see on kas tõusta ja võidelda või surra kõik neli.<br/><br/>süsteem Rothschilds on kokku varisemas, sest liiga palju kontrolli alt väljas, kontrollimatu GREED, ja nüüd, see on nagu pikk hoone läheb edasi-tagasi nagu pendli maavärinas, mingil hetkel see lõpuks "snap" ja kukkuda. Me oleme, nagu teiegi, demokraatia ja võltsmajandusliku süsteemi lõppmängus, mis pandi toime kõigi suhtes, nii et seal on kokkupõrge REALITY'ga üsna varsti, ja see ei saa olema ilus.<br/><br/>Kui ma oleksin SCOTUS, siis ma hoolitseksin selle eest, et need lennukid oleksid kütusega varustatud, piloodid seisavad valmis oma viimaseks PARAGUAYANi reisiks Bushi kompleksi, kus nad peidavad, kui õhupall lõpuks siia jõuab.<br/><br/>Aga üha enam paistab, et nad suruvad III maailmasõjale kõvasti peale, et võtta kõigilt silmad peast.<br/><br/>arvete päev on tõesti tulemas. Ja see ei ole ilus.<br/><br/>Kommenteerides, mis ma arvan, et toimub nüüd on see.... &#124;<br/>veebruar 2, 2010<br/>&#124; Vastus<br/><br/>Nõustun, et kokkuvarisemise süsteemid on nende, mitte Ameerika, ja vaadake seda linki Rense.com-ist:<br/><br/>Tundub, et korporatokraatia taga olev inetu, mitme kombitsaga ROTHSCHILD koletis üritab end maskeerida avamere naftaplatvormiks või midagi, kas pole?<br/><br/>Kolmandas maailmasõjas suruvad nad ka ülestõusu, et visata põhiseadus välja meeleheitlikult ja põlgusega, et nad saaksid selle oma kujundusega asendada.<br/><br/>Minu enda idee ja arusaamine peavad olema piirangud sellele, mida kujutab endast kõne, et vältida termini nõmedaks muutmist ja esimese muudatuse liiga liberaalset tõlgendust.<br/><br/>Me ei pea jõudma küsimuseni, kas valitsusel on kaalukas huvi takistada välismaistel isikutel või ühendustel mõjutada meie rahva poliitilist protsessi. Vrd. 2 U.S.C. §441e (välisriigi kodanike suhtes kohaldatav sissemaksete ja kulutuste keeld). Punkt 441b ei ole piiratud välisriigis asutatud või peamiselt välismaiste aktsionäride poolt rahastatavate ettevõtete või ühendustega. Paragrahv 441b oleks seega liiga lai, isegi kui me eeldaksime, et valitsusel on tungiv huvi piirata välismaist mõju meie poliitilisele protsessile.<br/>U.S., kell 615. >><br/><br/>USA läks pankrotti, kui FDR helistas kullale. Meil ei olnud enam kulda, et maksta FED-lt laenatud paberi eest. See on nüüd iga-aastases pankroti ümberpaigutamises. Valitsus on nüüd privaatne nagu BLACKWATER. Kõik valitsusasutused on loetletud DUNN JA BRADSTREET. Ühise õiguse, mis põhiseaduse täpsustab puudutab füüsilised inimesed. Kõik äri kohtute täna on ettevõtte tähenduses, et me vaadatakse üksikute korporatsioonide. Me eksisteerime riigiga sõlmitud lepingu alusel. Pidage meeles 14. muudatust. Enne seda ei olnud USA kodanikke. Enamik meist on tahtmatult väitnud USA ettevõtte kodakondsust. Me peame tegelema panganduse eliidi reegliga. Peaaegu kõik juhtivad REPS ja DEMS on välissuhete nõukogu või TLC liikmed. Vaadake üles selle ajalugu, kes alustas ja kontrollib neid. Rush, Glenn ja Sean on kõik valetajad ja pankurid. Obama on CFR-i nukk. 911 tõel on palju suurem tähendus ja see teeniks ausate inimeste ühendamist selles riigis.<br/><br/>Ma ei usu, et ma olen korporatsioon või ühe kodanik, kuid kui gubbermint arvab nii, kas SCOTUSi otsus tähendab, et kellelgi, ettevõtetel või üksikisikutel ei ole enam kampaania panuse piiranguid? Ma eelistaksin, et raha eemaldataks meie valimisprotsessist täielikult - võrdne aeg Ameerika eetrisse, mis on tasuta kõigile kandidaatidele. |
| And so the TWEWY Spriting Thread army set off, their destination being Japan. Unfortunately, no airline whatsoever would let them on board because of their rather large amassment of weapons of moderate destruction. And pitchtorches, which constituted both a fire and a stabbing hazard. And so, they just went home and downloaded the movie Kanon wanted to watch illegally. They gave it 7/10 stars on rotten tomatoes. The End.<br/><br/>Spoiler:The bottom right Sprite is the new one.<br/><br/>Highlight this box with your cursor to read the spoiler text.

Besides, no one else took the easy, predictable route, so somebody had to. Peace out.<br/><br/>The first sprite was half made by me. The second row contains a teaser for the continuation of the clown sprites i made a while back. And the third row is just a few old sprites that i decided to fix up and redo some parts.<br/><br/>So I just joined, and tried to make a sprite, it turned out ok, but it seemed like a lot of work, and I only made a few changes to neku. How do you make the complicated ones?<br/><br/>Spoiler:<br/><br/>Highlight this box with your cursor to read the spoiler text.<br/><br/>Spoiler:<br/><br/>How to get better at spriting:<br/><br/>1. To start off, master the art of recoloring sprites and shading. 2. Next start copying and pasting body parts to other sprites. E.x Take the arm band off of neku and put it on joshua. 3. Start small by switching around body parts and re-coloring them. (in other words, just experiment and see which combo you like) 4. Then start to challenging yourself to make more complex sprites. Instead of copying and pasting and recoloring, you can try and draw clothes or faces. 5. PRACTICE PRACTICE AND MORE PRACTICE. Keep practicing and experimenting and never give upPeace out.<br/><br/>Sometimes people need to be reminded not to give up so easily and continue to persist. | Ja nii TWEWY Spriting Thread armee läks, nende sihtkoht on Jaapan. Kahjuks ei lubanud ükski lennufirma neid pardale, kuna nende suhteliselt suur kogunemine mõõduka hävitamise relvad. Ja pitchtorches, mis moodustasid nii tulekahju kui ka pussitamise ohu. Ja nii nad lihtsalt läksid koju ja laadisid alla filmi, mida Kanon tahtis ebaseaduslikult vaadata. Nad andsid sellele 7/10 tähte mädanenud tomatitel.

Kuidas teha keerulisi?<br/><br/>Spoiler:<br/><br/>Spoileri teksti lugemiseks tõstke see kast kursoriga esile.<br/><br/>Spoiler:<br/><br/>Kuidas saada paremaks pritsmetega:<br/><br/>1. Et alustada, kapten kunsti recoloring sprites ja varjutamine. 2. Järgmine alustada kopeerimine ja kleepimine kehaosad teiste sprites. E.x Võtke käepael neku ja pane see Joshua. 3. Alusta väike, lülitades ümber kehaosad ja uuesti värvimine neid. (Teisisõnu, lihtsalt katsetage ja vaadake, milline kombinatsioon sulle meeldib) 4. Seejärel alustage ennast keerukamate sprite'ide tegemiseks. Kopeerimise ja kleepimise ja värvimise asemel võite proovida riideid või nägusid joonistada. 5. PRAKTIKA JA MORE PRAKTIKA. Jätkake harjutamist ja eksperimenteerimist ning ärge kunagi loobuge rahust.<br/><br/>Mõnikord tuleb inimestele meelde tuletada, et nad ei loobuks nii lihtsalt ja jätkaksid püsimist. |
| Interpretive Summary: This book chapter reviews various aspects of what is needed for the selection of model weeds to answer questions pertinent to weed science. Specifically, the chapter covers why we need model species, attributes of model species, and provides the current state of knowledge and resources that have been developed for a few key weeds such as leafy spurge, Canada thistle, waterhemp, and purple false brome that may make them good potential models.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract:<br/>Selection of a limited number of model weeds and development of genomic-based tools and resources will facilitate studies on the ecology, biology, physiology and development of weedy species. Such studies will help answer fundamental questions of concern to weed scientists. However, to ensure the weed science community can appropriately and fully utilize these model weeds, they will need to be carefully selected. Various attributes such as ease of study, weedy characteristics, and importance as a weedy species will need to be considered. Additionally, the availability of existing genomic resources can be used to extend the list of viable model weeds. Several resources have also been developed specifically for weeds such as leafy spurge, Canada thistle, waterhemp, and purple false brome. | Tõlgendav kokkuvõte: Selles raamatu peatükis vaadeldakse erinevaid aspekte, mida on vaja mudel umbrohu valikuks, et vastata umbrohu teadusega seotud küsimustele. Täpsemalt hõlmab peatükk seda, miks me vajame mudelliike, mudelliikide atribuute, ning pakub praegust teadmiste ja ressursside taset, mis on välja töötatud mõne olulise umbrohu jaoks, nagu näiteks lehtköögivili, Kanada ohakas, vesihemp ja lilla vale broom, mis võib muuta need head potentsiaalsed mudelid.<br/><br/>Tehniline abstrakt:<br/>Piiratud arvu umbrohumudelite valimine ning genoomipõhiste vahendite ja ressursside arendamine hõlbustab umbrohuliikide ökoloogia, bioloogia, füsioloogia ja arengu uuringuid. Sellised uuringud aitavad vastata umbrohu teadlastele murettekitavatele põhiküsimustele. Kuid selleks, et umbrohu teadusringkond saaks neid mudel umbrohtusid asjakohaselt ja täielikult kasutada, tuleb need hoolikalt valida. Arvesse tuleb võtta erinevaid atribuute, nagu õppimise lihtsus, umbrohu omadused ja tähtsus umbrohuliigina. Lisaks saab olemasolevate genoomsete ressursside kättesaadavust kasutada elujõuliste mudelite umbrohtude nimekirja laiendamiseks. Mitmed ressursid on välja töötatud ka spetsiaalselt umbrohtude jaoks, nagu näiteks lehtköögivili, Kanada ohakas, vesihemp ja lilla vale broom. |
