| Bacopa<br/><br/>19 Nov 2015<br/>Posted by Doxiderol<br/><br/>Bacopa is a perennial plant that thrives in marshy subtropical and tropical regions around the globe. The highly regarded herb is a key ingredient in Doxiderol, a nutritional supplement that enhances cognitive function. Bacopa was chosen for its ability to protect the brain and increase acetylcholine, a biochemical messenger that enables the nervous system to relay information.<br/><br/>Ayurvedic practitioners first described the therapeutic properties of bacopa in 300 BC. The physicians recorded bacopa's abilities to enhance intelligence and memory. Nearly 2,500 years later, a growing body of modern research confirms the cognitive benefits of bacopa recorded in the Ayurvedic text.<br/><br/>In 1987, researchers in India evaluated the effects of bacopa on the intellectual function of school-aged children. During the four-week study, they administered bacopa to 40 children who were 6 to 8 years old. The scientists determined that bacopa increased perception and memory. The children were able to solve maze exercises quicker and more accurately after receiving bacopa. Many parents in India routinely use bacopa to enhance their children's intellectual development.<br/><br/>A 12-week study published in the August 2001 issue of Psychopharmacology investigated the effects of bacopa on cognitive function. Scientists randomly assigned the healthy volunteers, aged 18 to 65, to receive bacopa or an inactive substance. They also used a double-blind configuration for the study to conceal the identities of the products. Researchers use this design to ensure that the test results are valid because it eliminates bias by the researchers and participants. The bacopa group experienced a significant improvement in the speed at which they were able to process visual information. The participants also learned faster and stored new memories more efficiently.<br/><br/>In 2007, a Texas A&M College of Medicine laboratory study revealed one of the mechanisms responsible for bacopa's ability to promote brain health. According to the scientists, bacopa uses polyphenols to prevent oxidative stress and the damage that it causes to healthy brain cells. Bacopa also reduces harmful deposits of a substance known as beta-amyloid, which is the primary component of the plaque in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease.<br/><br/>A double-blind study published in the July 2008 issue of the Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine evaluated the effect of bacopa on elderly patients. The study confirmed that bacopa increased cognitive performance while reducing stress. According to the authors, the benefits achieved in this study confirmed the results of earlier research.<br/><br/>A 90-day study published in the December 2008 issue of Phytotherapy Research confirms the cognitive benefits that were previously demonstrated in other bacopa studies. Bacopa significantly improved the ability of the participants to temporarily store and use information required for completing a complex task. The double-blind study also demonstrated that bacopa reduced the time required to process visual information.<br/><br/>In addition to enhancing nerve signal transmission, the scientists theorize that bacopa increases cognitive function by reducing anxiety. Numerous studies indicate that anxiety interferes with the ability to perform tasks that require higher-level cognitive functions, such as learning and memorization. Stress disrupts biochemical messengers and healthy nerve signal transmission. Bacopa alleviates stress and restores a sense of calm by increasing acetylcholine levels, which reduces your heart rate and enables you to take deeper breaths.<br/><br/>Doxiderol is a great way to obtain the benefits of bacopa. This holistic supplement also contains other natural ingredients that promote brain health and support your ability to focus and concentrate on complex task as well as memorize information. | Bacopa<br/><br/>19. nov 2015<br/>Postitanud Doxiderol<br/><br/>Bacopa on mitmeaastane taim, mis õitseb soodes subtroopilistes ja troopilistes piirkondades kogu maailmas. Kõrgelt hinnatud ravimtaim on Doxideroli, kognitiivset funktsiooni suurendava toidulisandi peamine koostisosa. Bacopa valiti oma võimet kaitsta aju ja suurendada atsetüülkoliini, biokeemiline messenger, mis võimaldab närvisüsteemi edastada teavet.<br/><br/>Ayurveda praktikud kirjeldasid esmakordselt bacopa terapeutilisi omadusi 300 eKr. Arstid registreerisid bacopa võimed intelligentsuse ja mälu suurendamiseks. Ligikaudu 2500 aastat hiljem kinnitab tänapäevaste uuringute kasvav hulk bacopa kognitiivset kasu, mis on salvestatud Ayurveda tekstis.<br/><br/>Aastal 1987 hindasid India teadlased bacopa mõju kooliealiste laste intellektuaalsele funktsioonile. Neljanädalase uuringu käigus manustati bacopa 40 lapsele, kes olid 6-8-aastased. Teadlased tegid kindlaks, et bacopa suurendas taju ja mälu. Lapsed suutsid lahendada labürindi harjutusi kiiremini ja täpsemalt pärast bacopa saamist. Paljud vanemad Indias rutiinselt kasutada bacopa suurendada oma laste intellektuaalset arengut.<br/><br/>Psühhofarmakoloogia 2001. aasta augusti numbris avaldatud 12-nädalases uuringus uuriti bacopa mõju kognitiivsele funktsioonile. Teadlased määrasid juhuslikult terved vabatahtlikud, vanuses 18 kuni 65, saama bacopa või mitteaktiivset ainet. Nad kasutasid ka topeltpimedat konfiguratsiooni, et varjata toodete identiteete. Teadlased kasutavad seda disaini, et tagada katsetulemuste kehtivus, sest see kõrvaldab teadlaste ja osalejate erapoolikuse. Bacopa grupp koges olulist paranemist kiiruses, millega nad suutsid visuaalset teavet töödelda. Osalejad õppisid ka kiiremini ja salvestasid uusi mälestusi tõhusamalt.<br/><br/>2007. aastal avastas Texas A&M College of Medicine laboratoorne uuring ühe mehhanismi, mis vastutab bacopa võime eest edendada aju tervist. Teadlaste sõnul kasutab bacopa polüfenoole, et vältida oksüdatiivset stressi ja kahju, mida see põhjustab tervetele ajurakkudele. Bacopa vähendab ka kahjulikku ladestumist ainet, mida nimetatakse beeta-amüloidiks, mis on Alzheimeri tõvega patsientide aju naastu peamine komponent.<br/><br/>Alternatiivse ja täiendava meditsiini ajakirja 2008. aasta juuli numbris avaldatud topeltpimedas uuringus hinnati bacopa mõju eakatele patsientidele. Uuring kinnitas, et bacopa suurendas kognitiivset jõudlust, vähendades samal ajal stressi. Autorite sõnul kinnitasid käesolevas uuringus saavutatud eelised varasemate uuringute tulemusi.<br/><br/>Phytotherapy Researchi 2008. aasta detsembri numbris avaldatud 90-päevane uuring kinnitab kognitiivseid eeliseid, mida varem demonstreeriti teistes bacopa uuringutes. Bacopa parandas oluliselt osalejate võimet ajutiselt salvestada ja kasutada keeruka ülesande täitmiseks vajalikku teavet. Topeltpime uuring näitas ka, et bacopa vähendas visuaalse teabe töötlemiseks vajalikku aega.<br/><br/>Lisaks närviimpulsside edastamise suurendamisele arvavad teadlased, et bacopa suurendab kognitiivset funktsiooni, vähendades ärevust. Arvukad uuringud näitavad, et ärevus häirib võimet täita ülesandeid, mis nõuavad kõrgema taseme kognitiivseid funktsioone, näiteks õppimist ja meeldejätmist. Stress häirib biokeemilisi sõnumitoojaid ja tervet närvisignaali edastamist. Bacopa leevendab stressi ja taastab meelerahu, suurendades atsetüülkoliini taset, mis vähendab teie südame löögisagedust ja võimaldab teil sügavamalt hingata.<br/><br/>Doxiderol on suurepärane võimalus saada bacopa eeliseid. See terviklik lisand sisaldab ka teisi looduslikke koostisosi, mis edendavad aju tervist ja toetavad teie võimet keskenduda ja keskenduda keerukatele ülesannetele ning meelde jätta teavet. |

She can also sense demonic auras as well as evil auras. When she was born and growing, however, her powers were sealed and she was much less powerful. Since the defeat of the one sealing her powers, Kagome has reached her full potential.<br/><br/>PURIFICATION By making a physical connection, Kagome has the ability to purify both poison and darkness from a subject (living and inanimate). To do so, she projects her spiritual powers through her hand.<br/><br/>SPIRITUAL BARRIERS With her full potential, Kagome has the ability to create a barrier around herself and expand it around others. It is a dome-shaped barrier that can destroy weak demons that make contact with the barrier.<br/><br/>IMPROVED EYESIGHT<br/>Kagome has the ability to see things that are often invisible to the human eye: ghosts, spirits, divine and evil auras.<br/><br/>ABILITIES WITH WEAPONS<br/>Kagome has the ability to use a bow and arrow. She has been self trained, and after years of practice, her arrow rarely misses its mark. Alongside this, Kagome has the ability to infuse her arrows with powers. She can infuse an arrows with her spiritual powers which allows them to penetrate demonic forces, destroy spells, and purify objects. She can infuse her bow with her powers and deflect enemy attacks. She has the ability to infuse her arrows with purifying energy to purify poison as well as powerful, long distant demonic attacks. And, finally, she has the ability to bypass others with her arrow: If her target happens to be behind a barrier or a hostage, the arrow can teleport and hit only her target<br/><br/>The rest of her abilities have become rather unimportant as they are related to time travel (through the Bone Eater's Well), the Shikon Jewel, or her previous incarnation.<br/><br/>the canon<br/><br/>Kagome has been pulled a few days after her high school graduation, however, before the Bone Eater's Well has opened again to allow her to return to the past permanently.<br/><br/>freestyle<br/><br/>memories<br/><br/>かごめ<br/><br/>The sound of her name was a soft whisper in the back of her mind, like a call muffled by the wind. It was the sound of a distant memory, a voice that she had started to forget but desperately clung to all the same. It was her mother's voice, twisted in the sorrow of her lost daughter. Afterall, Kagome banished without a trace. She vividly remembered those moments, the way the day had begun, what she had for breakfast and the last thing she had said to her mother. It was haunting, those memories, because it was like any other time she had slipped between worlds. She had woken, listless, because she had no purpose outside of school. She could find a job, and was scheduled for an interview that day. Her heart hadn't been in it, but it was what she needed to do.<br/><br/>She remembered the feeling of dread, sucking it up and giving herself a pep talk that she could do this. That she could progress in the life that she was meant to now that things had been settled in the past. Of course, she had the lingering feeling that she no longer belonged in her own time or her own life. Not with everything that she had left behind.<br/><br/>Kagome remembered the feeling of the wood beneath her fingers, the way her hand had curled into the handle to slide the door open. She remembered that she paused, turning to her mother with a bright and vibrant smile as she shook herself from her stupor. "I'm taking off." She remembered how strong her voice sounded, the smile on her mother's lips as her eyes shone with pride. Her mother bade her farewell, which didn't seem any different than before but somehow the weight of the words settled in heavier on Kagome's shoulders the more she reflected.<br/><br/>Briefly, the thoughts flickered forward, wondering if her mother worried over her, missed her like she did. Kagome could openly admit that her mother's strength, her support for the fact that her daughter slipped through time so frequently. There were times when she thought herself weak for not having the woman to lean on.<br/><br/>However, she remembered that she did muster up a meager amount of strength.She could remember the shift in the air, the temperature notably different than what she had expected, blinking at the sudden and unfamiliar surroundings. It was not her family's shrine. And when she turned to go back, to slip through the door she had come through, she was met with unfamiliar and cold metal beneath her fingertips and an interior that was not the entrance of her house. A man stood before her, behind a counter, who stared at her with eyes as wide as her own.<br/><br/>She didn't panic, at least. Being torn through time and placed in impossible situations at least built your willpower as far as strange happenings went. Because it wasn't every day that someone found themselves dragged into the past by a demon, intent on ripping a powerful jewel from their body that they didn't even know was there. And then there was the fact that she had shattered said powerful jewel into who knows how many pieces and was tasked on finding them. Such things were not normal, and she had needed to square up and roll with it once she realized that was her reality. It had seemed so simple, just gather the shards and fix the jewel.<br/><br/>But it hadn't been easy, there were many demons after the shards and the jewel itself. And one particularly powerful demon with a wish that he was determined to see fulfilled. To this day, she had never learned his wish but knew it had never been granted even once he had the blasted thing completed. He had ruined so many lives for the sake of nothing. Ruined so many lives for such a futile task. Naraku had been the most difficult foe, and the one who had been the center of everything that had gone wrong in all of her friend's lives.<br/><br/>But, it was that unpredicability, that necessity to roll with what was happening and the willpower that she had gained from her adventure that she remembered drawing upon to come up with a story that fit in the moment that didn't seem too whimsical or far fetched. She needed to be believed, she needed to survive.<br/><br/>Afterall, she faced worse than a man in a camera store. She had lied through her teeth to save her life before.<br/><br/>"I was looking for a job." In the end, it wasn't a complete lie. After all, she had set out of her house with the intent of attending a job interview. Her state of dress would at least attest to that much. It was one of the easier fibs she had ever told.<br/><br/>And, for some reason, that crazy man hired her.<br/><br/>かごめ<br/><br/>Kagomed rolled over in her bed as she pushed back the distant memories, refusing to acknowledge that she was really awake. She clawed at the last glimpses of sleep, begging it to return and to take her back into its embrace. She closed her eyes, willing sleep to come and was only met with memories. The echoes of a song sang in the distance of her memories, a song that had often tormented her, given the same name as her. The voice that sang was no longer reminiscent of her mother, but the voices of children who she had often played with growing up. They called back the memories, even though it had been years since she started this live, even though she was happy in this life, the call of these memories was too loud.<br/><br/>Suddenly, she was falling back into them and sleep evaded her again. She was watching herself in her family's embrace while Inuyasha was pulled back into the well, looking as startled as she had felt. The memories of that moment, those feelings, were still so strong. The feeling of heartbreak and sorrow welled up again though it had been so long since she had felt like she had been ripped away from everything that mattered to her.<br/><br/>Of course her family mattered, and she was happy to be in their arms again. She could never fully, truly describe how she had felt in those days. She still couldn't explain the way she felt split in two, with warring desires to be in both her past and present. She remembered the futile attempts to jump through the well, fingers clawing at the ground in a desperate plea to let her return. The first month home, she didn't sleep so much as she cried.<br/><br/>Elysion had garnished a similar reaction, though it was not so fierce because she didn't know exactly where she had slipped through nor did she know where she could worm her way back. Her explorations were subtle between working her job and trying to settle herself into this life. She had no intentions of staying, no intentions of lingering longer than she needed. And while she didn't try as fiercely as she had when she tried to return to the past, her passion was tenfold because she had no ties to this world. Because she was truly alone… With no hope of anyone to reach her.<br/><br/>In her irrational moments, she thought the Jewel had pulled her back and found a new hell for her to reside in. A new hell that would force her to make a wish, but she remembered very clearly that she had wished it gone forever. That didn't stop her dreams, the times when she woke up in the night sobbing. And those memories of her past were the hardest to deal with, the hardest to forget. Her heart began to race in a panic as she turned in her bed again, her breath became a struggle as she fought against a panic attack induced by her wandering mind this late into the night.<br/><br/>She hated feeling so weak, so afraid.<br/><br/>籠の中の鳥は<br/><br/>Kagome finally pulled herself from bed, her room lit with a pale light that was enough to guide her to the bathroom. She stood before the mirror, the sink running while she stared at her reflection. Raven colored hair covered her face and she felt as bad as she looked. Her first morning in Elysion was similar to this, only she was in worse shape.<br/><br/>She had found a place to sleep, managing to work out a deal with the owner of the building to allow her to stay a small period of time without paying. Perhaps it had been Miroku's influence that allowed her to strike such deals, as the monk was known for his way in charming (or scamming) people into giving them more than enough for the work they had done. The monk had always been that way, since they had first met. He would claim the dwelling of a lord to be haunted when it was not or, claim that they were subject to an attack when they would not be. He would sell his wards and charms for such high prices. It worked practically every time and she wondered why people had been so willing to trust him.<br/><br/>Perhaps it was his smile, or the fact that he was a monk that the people of the past were so willing to crumble. He never preyed on the weak, at least. He always did what was right and he was a symbol of strength to her at times when he would push through everything in order to do what was right. He pushed through the fact that he was dying, that he was cursed, and tried to do something about it rather than wallowing in his fate. He had pushed himself to the limit in the time leading up to their final fight. And she had been glad that they had defeated Naraku before he could become subject to the same fate as his father, and his father before him.<br/><br/>As far as her own charms went, however, she was more fair than her friend and made the deal reasonable. She doubted that anyone in this world would pay a hefty price for an exorcism or banishing demons. They were too technologically advanced for that. But she was clever enough, and smart enough, to make a good deal.<br/><br/>But now, Kagome was in a better place though the look on her face looked the same. Haunted, tired, drained...<br/><br/>A quick glance at a clock on the wall told her that she could try to sleep longer. But she opted out of that, not wanting to face the flashbacks again. She took a shower instead, using the cold water to chase away her demons, to fill her lungs with a sharp intake of breath and force herself awake.<br/><br/>いついつ出やる<br/><br/>It didn't work.<br/><br/>Not in the way she was wanting. The cold water certainly forced the air into her lungs, forced her mind to wake and muscles to seize. A bitter laugh was pulled from her lips as she tilted her head back and found herself remembering more. Today, she wasn't going to escape them so easily. She wasn't going to recover so simply, to recover just because she willed it.<br/><br/>Sometimes, there's no avoiding the thoughts you wanted to. Even when you were certain that you were past them.<br/><br/>Sango would have been a great help in this situation. The demon slayer was her best friend, she would even go as far as to call her the sister that she never had. An older sister who was wise, always had her side when trouble arose. Particularly boy trouble, when such things were rather trivial but it was fun to have a crush and for her friend to be mad on her behalf when Inuyasha made her sad. After all, it had been often that the half-demon would run to his dead lover's side and break her heart more than once.<br/><br/>But, Sango also inspired her in other ways. After all the woman had faced, she had always been so strong, so sure... Even in the times that she had doubted herself, she always pulled through. She admired that she had the ability to survive after losing her whole family -- the reminder of this often pushed Kagome to survive, because she lost everyone to this world -- and then having her brother become a pawn of Naraku. It wasn't easy, couldn't have been something to that just anyone could face and still go forward with. She still smiled, even with that pain and those reminders... She was often so bright, even in the darker times.<br/><br/>And right now, she wanted to lean into the older woman's side, to take comfort in the fact that she was there and she was supportive. She felt that Sango would somehow pull through this, and offer some words of strength and understanding. It was times like these that made these spells worse, the constant reminder that she was without her family.<br/><br/>"I don't want to be alone." She cried aloud in her solitude, the sound of the shower drowning out the plea.<br/><br/>She wasn't afraid to admit it.<br/><br/>夜明けの晩に<br/><br/>Another hour had slipped by before she had realized it. Her skin was cold from the water and it felt like ice ran through her veins. She hadn't realized she had begun to shiver until her hand reached to turn off the water and end her shower. Kagome didn't seek her own gaze in the mirror again, instead, she wrapped herself in towels and trudged out of the bathroom, up the stairs and into her kitchen. She started on making a light breakfast, idly reading through her notes for the day as the food cooked.<br/><br/>Her career was really taking off these last years. Her photos were featured in many galleries, her name started to frequent many lips for those who were interested in photography.<br/><br/>The job she had asked for on a whim had sparked it all. She had been far more lucky than she had expected to be in this world. Never lucky enough to slip back through the cracks into her own world, but lucky enough to do well. As she turned back to the stove, she remembered the time she had finally given up on returning home. It was about two years into her life here, as she had started to venture into photography as more than just a hobby but something she could make a name for herself with.<br/><br/>That day had been particularly pleasant, the sun was high in the sky and she had found herself taking some photos of the natural scenery. A little boy had hidden in one of the plants, and she had caught a picture of the moment his face had settled into a cheerful, mischievous grin the moment before he had jumped out to startle his prey. It reminded her of Shippou, the little kitsune she had, essentially, adopted. He, too, had been torn from his family when they had first met. His father killed and he was determined to avenge him. While young, he did seem so mature in their first encounters.<br/><br/>Maybe it had been the influence of Inuyasha that allowed the kit to act like a kid again, to be young and whimsical at times while others he was more mature. He offered comfort to her in his own way, and she tried to care for him as she would her own though she had been so young then as well. However, her youth did not stop her from understanding how to tend to him or care for him like her child. Her heart swelled when he smiled, when he had been so happy for his gift of crayons and took the time to make art. She was so proud of each drawing that he had finished that she knew that this was how a mother would feel in such a situation.<br/><br/>The pain that had ripped through her was too much, too sudden. She missed him and wanted to see how much he had grown since she had been gone. She had missed so much...<br/><br/>To spare herself any further pain, any false hopes… She gave up. And focused on bettering herself.<br/><br/>鶴と亀が<br/><br/>Breakfast tasted bland, boring, and inspired. Only after she had finished did she realized she had forgotten to any sort of spices or flavor to the food. It was too late now to remember that much, as her mind was too busy remembering other details of her life that clearly had become more important than her food.<br/><br/>"Sit!"<br/><br/>Of course, nothing happened when she had angrily yelled at one particularly frustrating client that reminded her of the half-demon. He was being particularly stubborn and rude, wanting a photo taken his way rather than letting it work out naturally. You could try to force wild animals to behave how you wanted. But, rarely did anyone succeed with force. Inuyasha wasn't as bad, however. Inuyasha had learned before she had been forced away from him. He had become gentler, more understanding, more mature though there were times he was still childish and cocky.<br/><br/>She remember how red her cheeks had burned, but how she stood her ground and fired him. She told him she refused to work for anyone or with anyone who wanted to twist something beyond it's nature, beyond it's own desires.<br/><br/>She should have compared the man to Naraku rather than Inuyasha. Though her client did not have such extreme intentions. At least the feeling afterwards was a pleasant memory. The freedom of knowing that she had come so far that she could refuse work that she didn't want to do, to be her own person that was independent of others. She could say that she made it at that point. Even though she heard rumors days later with words meant to slander her.<br/><br/>She defended herself righteously, like she did towards the end of her journey. After all, she was the only one who could protect herself in this world.<br/><br/>滑った<br/><br/>Morning light began to creep into her home, reminding her again of the passage of time. Again, she considered the list of things she had to do and debated on where to start. Or, if she should even start at all. With how the day began, she didn't know if she could consider that a great idea. It was doubtful that she would be successful with how lost in herself she was becoming.<br/><br/>She didn't want to mess up her latest work. Because she had done that on a few occasions before. It wasn't pleasant to try and recover from a complete disaster.<br/><br/>Kagome remembered the feeling of her expensive, brand new, camera slipping from her hands. She wasn't prepared to support it, because she had just removed it from her bag. Part of her screamed on the inside. A dramatic, over-the-top, full on scream that she frequently did when she was much, much younger. When she was struggling to make it through middle school while hopping between times. The other part of her had remained frozen in place while her lense completely shattered and the rest of the camera had broken along with it.<br/><br/>Seeing Inuyasha's brother, a full demon, standing before her was the last thing she expected when she had made her way out for her photos. He stood as proud as ever, as tall as ever, as imposing as she remembered. He didn't look fazed at all to be in an entirely different world, though she was never the best at reading his mind. His name on her lips was so potent, that she could remember the tiniest feelings as she did. Her lips were chapped, her mouth felt dry, and the bubbling feeling of anxiety in her stomach made her feel sick.<br/><br/>She didn't want her hopes to be up.<br/><br/>But, she wanted him to be there, even if they were not friends. They were allies, if anything, since they had fought side by side. And something was better than absolutely nothing.<br/><br/>And Kagome had the sense enough not to throw herself at him, to wrap her arms around him in relief that knowing she was not alone. Her camera no longer mattered when she approached him. She remembered that nothing else mattered for days as she spent time with him, not speaking of their world but speaking (or, she was speaking and he simply acknowledged that fact).<br/><br/>When, exactly, she fell for him though… Kagome couldn't recall. It was a subtle thing, just like he was. But she knew the feeling was there. And he let her know that she was not alone in the fact that she had fallen, that feelings had somehow blossomed.<br/><br/>後ろの正面<br/><br/>A feeling of weightlessness overtook her and suddenly her eyes opened while her mind desperately clawed for the last thing she was doing. She didn't recall when she had fallen asleep on her couch, but she knew the last place she had been was on the far too comfortable cushions. She didn't struggle, however, or fight the weightlessness as she was in familiar arms. Her head tilted against Sesshoumaru's chest, taking comfort in the fact that he was here and she wasn't alone.<br/><br/>"Welcome back." His response was a soft hum in acknowledgement. He didn't need to speak much for her to understand his intent, or the rest of what he had to say.<br/><br/>He carried her back to her bed, settled her into it with ease. Her eyes met his and she smiled easily because no more memories drifted back, no more recollections teased at her. No, whenever he was near, she never fell back into those thoughts. He had helped, and the years had helped. Today was just… One of those days.<br/><br/>"Sleep." He commanded with ease, her eyes rolled at him but she did not fight because she was tired. Her hand clung tightly to him, while she felt his opposite hand press to her forehead in assessment of her wellbeing.<br/><br/>"I'm okay," she said, her words firm with her promise.<br/><br/>She was okay. She was alive. And she was happy.<br/><br/>だあれ<br/><br/>shipper<br/><br/>summary<br/><br/>Kagome, at one point in her life, was a rather regular teenage girl until she was attacked by a demon inside her family's well house. The demon dragged her down into the well, which magically transported her about 500 years into the past. There, she learned that a sacred jewel was encased inside her body as she was the reincarnation of a priestess that had died 50 years prior to the time she was dragged into. The jewel was ripped from her body and the demon that dragged her through time was defeated by the half-demon that she freed who was pinned to the tree. Kagome befriended the half-demon, Inuyasha, in time and traveled with him to restore the jewel that she, herself, shattered. Though it was not so straightforward and easy to do as many demons and humans sought the jewel for their own purposes. She befriended a young kitsune demon, a monk, and a demon slayer who all traveled with her to restore the jewel.<br/><br/>Her group, however, was not the one to complete the jewel. Instead, an evil half-demon who manipulated the majority of the major events in most of her companion's lives. When he finally collected all the pieces of the jewel and made his wish on the tainted object, Kagome was drawn into the jewel itself with the intent of her making a selfish wish to keep her trapped inside forever, keeping the jewel alive. It was the stubbornness of Inuyasha that managed to save her from the darkness. In the end, she returned to her natural time, finished high school as was expect from a girl of her timeline. Though days later, Kagome ended up in Elysion. She has been in this world for five years, and has long since given up on returning home. She's settled happily into her new life.<br/><br/>platonic<br/><br/>It's rather easy for Kagome to make new friends, she hasn't changed much from her youth. She is a cheerful young woman who is empathetic and welcoming to most of all in her life. In her youth, she befriended demons when most would fear them. Even demons that used to eat humans, she has befriended and she changed their ways (she'd like to think). This being said, it's really easy to become her friend as long as someone is able to shown that they are willing to be redeemed, or show that they are not completely evil. She feels greatly for everyone she meets, so it's hard for her not to be drawn to others in a desire to be friends.<br/><br/>antagonistic<br/><br/>The only way to earn Kagome's wrath is to be so deplorable, so evil, and so far beyond redemption that she can't see any good in you. And she can see the good in pretty much everyone and everything. Honestly, with whom she has faced? A half-demon that pitted two lovers against each other, that cursed the entire male line of one of her friends, and then had her best friend's brother kill their family… Yeah, I don't see her hating anyone without them really, really working for it. Feel free to give it a shot, though.<br/><br/>romantic<br/><br/>When in love, Kagome is a strong support, always staying there even when things may be rough. However, Kagome is not looking for love, wasn't looking for love when she arrived so any past relationships don't exist. This isn't to say that someone hasn't fallen in love with her. She can definitely be the subject of someone's unrequited love, she'll probably be oblivious about it, though. Finally, Kagome is currently engaged to Sesshoumaru, surprisingly. I'm totally open to potential AU things, though. <3<br/><br/>fandom hell<br/><br/>age ancient<br/><br/>species space queen<br/><br/>occupation dying<br/><br/>prefers she/her<br/><br/>awards<br/><br/>pro<br/>she/her est 62woo i suck at plot replies. but ok anyway!!! neptune is very friendly and has that 'cool' persona, he's really fun to be around, and he's SUPER good to work with. like he's super patient and he'll do anything she asks of him--he's really easy to work with, definitely in comparison to other models. so i love the idea of them being all work oriented friends at first and then turning into something more. neptune definitely tries to surround himself with people, because he loves having friends, and kagome is pretty much his type too? like she's sweet and she's a strong woman, and he is actually better friends with women than he is with men, idk why, he just loves being surrounded by female friends who knows. i love my guys being super good friends and protecting their girl friends honestly. but oh M A N i love pseduo-family type relationships and neptune is an only child, so he hasn't had any like, familial relationships like that. so her looking out for him all big sister like would make him be like ????? cause he's confused but also he actually really likes that LOL! they're both good kids, i think they'd be really fun ^^<br/><br/>fandom fire emblem: fates<br/><br/>age ninteen<br/><br/>species Part human / part dragon<br/><br/>occupation representative guardian<br/><br/>prefers she/her<br/><br/>awards<br/><br/>yonder<br/>she/her aest 20 posts<br/><br/>I haven't seen Inuyasha at all but... from what I've read Kagome seems to be one of those people who might be able to help Corrin out with her emotional state. There's a lot weighing on her mind since she had to fight her birth family against her will and last time she saw them they all pretty much hated her. Frankly she hasn't worked through everything yet since she was essentially at the head of a full-scale war. I feel they could be friends as Corrin is quite open in her personality, extremely trusting as well. She's just... hiding and struggling through a lot.

I love your idea of Kagome taking a pic of Elsa! You know, she's also a singer/performer at a local theater so I can imagine Kagome going there to scope things out and then catching Elsa backstage or something--and then the friendship could blossom from there!

Ta suudab tunda ka deemonlikke aurasid ja kurja aurasid. Kui ta sündis ja kasvas, olid tema võimed pitseeritud ja ta oli palju vähem võimas. Alates tema võimete pitseerimise lüüasaamisest on Kagome saavutanud oma täieliku potentsiaali.<br/><br/>Füüsilise ühenduse loomisega on Kagomel võime puhastada nii mürki kui ka pimedust subjektist (elus ja elutu). Selleks projitseerib ta oma vaimsed võimed oma käe kaudu.<br/><br/>Oma täieliku potentsiaaliga suudab Kagome luua enda ümber barjääri ja laiendada seda teiste ümber. See on kuplikujuline barjäär, mis võib hävitada nõrgad deemonid, kes puutuvad barjääriga kokku.<br/><br/>TÕHUSTATUD SILMASUS<br/>Kagomel on võime näha asju, mis on inimsilmale sageli nähtamatud: kummitused, vaimud, jumalikud ja kurjad aurad.<br/><br/>VÕIMALUSED RELVADEGA<br/>Kagome'il on võime kasutada vibu ja noolt. Ta on ise koolitatud ja pärast aastaid kestnud praktikat jääb tema nool harva märkamata. Selle kõrval on Kagome'il võime infundeerida oma nooled võimetega. Ta suudab infundeerida nooled oma vaimsete jõududega, mis võimaldab neil tungida deemonlikesse jõududesse, hävitada loitsud ja puhastada objekte. Ta saab infundeerida oma vibu oma võimetega ja suunata vaenlase rünnakuid. Tal on võime infundeerida oma nooled puhastava energiaga, et puhastada mürki ja võimsaid kaugeid deemonlikke rünnakuid. Ja lõpuks on tal võime oma noolega teistest mööda minna: kui tema sihtmärk juhtub olema barjääri või pantvangi taga, saab nool teleportida ja tabada ainult oma sihtmärki.<br/><br/>Ülejäänud tema võimed on muutunud üsna ebaoluliseks, kuna need on seotud ajas reisimisega (läbi kondi sööja kaevu), Shikoni juveeli või tema eelmise inkarnatsiooniga.<br/><br/>kaanon<br/><br/>Kagome on tõmmatud mõned päevad pärast keskkooli lõpetamist, kuid enne, kui Luu Sööja Kaev on uuesti avanud, et võimaldada tal jäädavalt minevikku tagasi pöörduda.<br/><br/>freestyle<br/><br/>mälestused<br/><br/>かごめ<br/><br/>Tema nime hääl oli vaikne sosin tema peas, nagu tuulest summutatud hüüd. See oli kauge mälestuse hääl, hääl, mida ta oli hakanud unustama, kuid meeleheitlikult klammerdunud kõik sama. See oli tema ema hääl, väänatud kurbust tema kadunud tütar. Lõppude lõpuks, Kagome pagendati jäljetult. Ta erksalt mäletas neid hetki, kuidas päev oli alanud, mida ta oli hommikusöögiks ja viimane asi, mida ta oli öelnud oma emale. See oli kummitav, need mälestused, sest see oli nagu iga teine kord, kui ta oli libisenud maailmade vahel. Ta oli ärganud, nohiklik, sest tal ei olnud mingit eesmärki väljaspool kooli. Ta võiks leida tööd, ja oli planeeritud intervjuu sel päeval. Tema süda ei olnud seal, kuid see oli see, mida ta pidi tegema.<br/><br/>Ta mäletas hirmu tunnet, imedes seda ja andes endale pep rääkida, et ta võiks seda teha. Et ta saaks edasi liikuda elus, et ta oli mõeldud nüüd, et asjad olid lahendatud minevikus. Loomulikult tundis ta, et ta ei kuulu enam oma aega ega oma elusse, mitte kõigesse, mille ta oli maha jätnud.<br/><br/>Kagome mäletas, kuidas tema käsi oli käepidemesse kõverdunud, et uks lahti libistada. Ta mäletas, et ta peatus, pöördudes ema poole särava ja elava naeratusega, kui ta raputas ennast oma stuporist. "Ma lahkun." Ta mäletas, kui tugev tema hääl kõlas, naeratus tema ema huultel, kui tema silmad särasid uhkusega. Tema ema jättis temaga hüvasti, mis ei tundunud midagi muud kui enne, kuid kuidagi kaalu sõnad seatud raskem Kagome õlgadele rohkem ta peegeldas.<br/><br/>Lühidalt, mõtted vilkusid edasi, mõtlesin, kas tema ema muretses tema pärast, igatses teda nagu ta tegi. Kagome võis avalikult tunnistada, et tema ema tugevus, tema toetus asjaolule, et tema tütar libises läbi aja nii sageli. Oli aegu, kui ta arvas, et ta on nõrk, sest tal ei ole naist, kellele toetuda.<br/><br/>Kuid ta mäletas, et ta kogus vähe jõudu. Ta mäletas õhu muutust, temperatuuri, mis oli märkimisväärselt erinev sellest, mida ta oli oodanud, vilkudes äkilises ja võõras ümbruses. See ei olnud tema pere pühamu. Ja kui ta pöördus tagasi, et libiseda läbi ukse ta oli tulnud, ta kohtus võõras ja külm metall all sõrmeotstega ja interjööri, mis ei olnud sissepääs tema maja. Mees seisis tema ees, leti taga, kes vaatas teda silmadega, mis olid sama laiad kui tema enda omad.<br/><br/>Ta ei sattunud paanikasse, ajas läbi rebituna ja võimatutesse olukordadesse asetatuna, vähemalt arendas ta sinu tahtejõudu nii kaugele, kui veidrad sündmused läksid. Sest see ei olnud iga päev, et keegi leidis, et deemon tõmbas end minevikku, kavatsusega rebida oma kehast võimas juveel, mida nad isegi ei teadnud. Ja siis oli asjaolu, et ta oli purustatud ütles võimas juveel kes teab, kui palju tükki ja oli ülesanne leida neid. Sellised asjad ei olnud normaalne, ja ta oli vaja rullida ja rulli see, kui ta mõistis, et see oli tema reaalsus. See tundus nii lihtne, lihtsalt koguge killud ja parandage juveel.<br/><br/>Aga see ei olnud kerge, seal oli palju deemoneid pärast kilde ja juveeli ennast. Ja üks eriti võimas deemon, kellel oli soov, et ta oli otsustanud näha, et see on täidetud. Tänaseks ei olnud ta kunagi õppinud tema soovi, kuid teadis, et seda ei olnud kunagi antud isegi siis, kui ta oli purustatud asja lõpetanud. Ta oli rikkunud nii palju elusid mitte millegi pärast. Ta rikkus nii palju elusid sellise mõttetu ülesande jaoks. Naraku oli olnud kõige raskem vaenlane, ja see, kes oli olnud keskmes kõik, mis oli läinud valesti kogu oma sõbra elu.<br/><br/>Kuid see oli see ettearvamatus, vajadus veeretada, mis juhtus, ja tahtejõud, mille ta oli oma seiklusest saanud, et ta mäletas, et ta tõmbas välja loo, mis sobis hetkega, mis ei tundunud liiga kapriisne või kaugelt tõmmatud. Ta vajas usku, ta vajas ellujäämist.<br/><br/>Lõppude lõpuks seisis ta silmitsi halvemini kui mees kaamerapoes. Ta oli varem oma elu päästmiseks hammaste kaudu valetanud.<br/><br/>"Ma otsisin tööd." Lõppkokkuvõttes ei olnud see täielik vale. Lõppude lõpuks oli ta oma majast lahkunud, et osaleda tööintervjuul. Tema riietus oleks vähemalt nii palju tõestanud. See oli üks lihtsamaid kiude, mida ta kunagi oli öelnud.<br/><br/>Ja mingil põhjusel see hull mees palkas ta.<br/><br/>かごめ<br/><br/>Kagomed veeretas oma voodis, kui ta lükkas tagasi kauged mälestused, keeldudes tunnistamast, et ta oli tõesti ärkvel. Ta küünistas viimase pilguga magada, kerjates teda tagasi ja võtta teda tagasi oma kallistust. Ta sulges oma silmad, valmis magama tulema ja kohtus ainult mälestustega. Laulude kajad laulsid tema mälestuste kaugusel, laul, mis oli teda sageli piinanud, andes talle sama nime. Hääl, mis laulis, ei meenutanud enam tema ema, vaid laste hääli, kellega ta oli sageli üles kasvanud. Nad kutsusid mälestused tagasi, kuigi see oli olnud aastaid, sest ta alustas seda live, kuigi ta oli õnnelik selles elus, nende mälestuste üleskutse oli liiga valju.<br/><br/>Järsku kukkus ta nendesse tagasi ja uni põgenes uuesti. Ta vaatas ennast oma pere embamisel, samal ajal kui Inuyasha tõmmati tagasi kaevu, vaadates nii ehmunud kui ta oli tundnud. Mälestused sellest hetkest, need tunded, olid ikka veel nii tugevad. Südamevalu ja kurbuse tunne tõusis uuesti, kuigi see oli olnud nii kaua aega tagasi, kui ta tundis, et ta oli ära rebitud kõigest, mis talle oluline oli.<br/><br/>Muidugi hoolis tema pere ja ta oli õnnelik, et oli jälle nende käte vahel. Ta ei suutnud kunagi täielikult, tõeliselt kirjeldada, mida ta oli tundnud neil päevil. Ta ikka ei suutnud seletada, kuidas ta tundis lõhenenud kaheks, sõjakas soove olla nii tema minevikus kui ka olevikus. Ta mäletas mõttetuid katseid hüpata läbi kaevu, sõrmed küünistades maapinnale meeleheitlikus palves, et lasta tal tagasi tulla. Esimesel kuul kodus ei maganud ta nii palju kui nuttis.<br/><br/>Elysion oli sarnase reaktsiooni kaunistanud, kuigi see ei olnud nii raevukas, sest ta ei teadnud täpselt, kus ta oli libisenud, ega ka seda, kus ta võiks ussid oma teed tagasi. Tema avastused olid peened, kui ta töötas oma tööga ja püüdis end sellesse ellu elama asuda. Tal ei olnud kavatsust jääda, ei olnud kavatsust kauemaks jääda, kui ta vajas. Ja kuigi ta ei püüdnud nii raevukalt, kui ta püüdis minevikku tagasi pöörduda, oli tema kirg kümnekordne, sest tal polnud selle maailmaga mingeid sidemeid, sest ta oli tõeliselt üksi... ilma lootuseta, et keegi temani jõuaks.<br/><br/>Oma irratsionaalsetel hetkedel arvas ta, et Jewel on ta tagasi tõmmanud ja leidnud talle uue põrgu, kus elada. Uus põrgu, mis sunniks teda soovima, kuid ta mäletas väga selgelt, et ta oli soovinud, et see oleks igaveseks läinud. See ei peatanud tema unenägusid, aegu, mil ta ärkas öösel oigamas ja mälestusi tema minevikust oli kõige raskem toime tulla, kõige raskem unustada. Tema süda hakkas võidujooksu paanika, kui ta pöördus oma voodi uuesti, tema hingamine sai võitlus, kui ta võitles paanikahood indutseeritud tema uitav meel nii hilja öösel.<br/><br/>Talle ei meeldinud tunda end nii nõrgana, nii hirmul.<br/><br/>籠の中の鳥は<br/><br/>Kagome lõpuks tõmbas ennast voodist välja, tema tuba põles kahvatu valgusega, mis oli piisav, et suunata teda vannituppa. Ta seisis peegli ees, valamu jooksis, kui ta vaatas oma peegeldust. Raven värvitud juuksed katsid tema nägu ja ta tundis sama halb kui ta nägi. Tema esimene hommik Elysion oli sarnane sellele, ainult ta oli halvemas vormis.<br/><br/>Ta oli leidnud koha, kus magada, suutes välja töötada tehingu hoone omanikuga, et võimaldada tal jääda lühikeseks ajaks ilma maksmata. Võib-olla oli see Miroku mõju, mis võimaldas tal tabada selliseid tehinguid, kuna munk oli tuntud oma viis võluvate (või petmine) inimestega, et anda neile rohkem kui piisavalt nende tehtud töö eest. Munk oli alati selline olnud, sest nad olid esimest korda kohtunud. Ta väitis, et isanda eluruumi kummitatakse, kui see ei olnud, või väitis, et nad olid rünnaku all, kui nad ei oleks. Ta müüs oma kogudused ja võlud nii kõrgete hindadega. See töötas praktiliselt iga kord ja ta mõtles, miks inimesed olid nii valmis teda usaldama.<br/><br/>Võib-olla oli see tema naeratus või asjaolu, et ta oli munk, et mineviku inimesed olid nii valmis murenema. Ta ei saagiks nõrk, vähemalt. Ta tegi alati seda, mis oli õige, ja ta oli tema tugevuse sümbol, kui ta lükkas kõike, et teha seda, mis oli õige. Ta surus läbi asjaolu, et ta oli suremas, et ta oli neetud, ja püüdis midagi ette võtta, selle asemel, et oma saatusesse vajuda. Ta oli surunud ennast piirini, mis viis nende viimase võitluseni. Ja ta oli rõõmus, et nad olid võitnud Naraku, enne kui ta võis sattuda sama saatuse alla nagu tema isa ja tema isa enne teda.<br/><br/>Niipalju kui tema enda võlusid läks, oli ta siiski õiglasem kui tema sõber ja tegi tehingu mõistlikuks. Ta kahtles, et keegi selles maailmas maksaks eksortsismi või deemonite väljasaatmise eest kõrget hinda. Nad olid selleks tehnoloogiliselt liiga arenenud. Aga ta oli piisavalt tark ja tark, et teha hea tehing.<br/><br/>Aga nüüd, Kagome oli paremas kohas, kuigi välimus tema nägu tundus sama. Haunted, väsinud, tühjenenud...<br/><br/>Kiire pilk kella seinal ütles talle, et ta võiks proovida kauem magada. Aga ta loobus sellest, ei taha silmitsi tagasilöökidega uuesti. Ta võttis selle asemel duši, kasutades külma vett, et ajada oma deemonid ära, täita oma kopsud terava hingamisega ja sundida ennast ärkama.<br/><br/>いついつ出やる<br/><br/>See ei toiminud.<br/><br/>Mitte nii, nagu ta soovis. Külm vesi sundis kindlasti õhku tema kopsudesse, sundis tema meelt ärkama ja lihaseid haarama. Kibe naer tõmmati tema huultest, kui ta kallutas oma pead tagasi ja leidis, et ta mäletab rohkem. Täna ta ei põgenenud nende eest nii lihtsalt, ta ei taastunud nii lihtsalt, lihtsalt sellepärast, et ta seda soovis.<br/><br/>Mõnikord ei saa vältida mõtteid, mida sa tahtsid, isegi kui sa olid kindel, et oled neist möödas.<br/><br/>Sango oleks olnud suur abi selles olukorras. Deemon tapja oli tema parim sõber, ta oleks isegi minna nii kaugele, et kutsuda teda õde, et ta kunagi olnud. Vanem õde, kes oli tark, oli alati tema poolel, kui probleemid tekkisid. Eriti poiss hädas, kui sellised asjad olid üsna tühine, kuid see oli lõbus on purustada ja tema sõber on vihane tema nimel, kui Inuyasha tegi tema kurb. Lõppude lõpuks oli see sageli, et pooldeemon jooksis oma surnud väljavalitu poole ja murdis tema südame rohkem kui üks kord.<br/><br/>Kuid Sango inspireeris teda ka muul viisil. Peale kõike seda, millega naine oli silmitsi seisnud, oli ta alati olnud nii tugev, nii kindel... Isegi aegadel, mil ta oli endas kahtlenud, oli ta alati läbi elanud. Ta imetles, et tal oli võime ellu jääda pärast kogu oma perekonna kaotamist - meeldetuletus sellest sageli tõukas Kagome ellu jääda, sest ta kaotas kõik sellele maailmale - ja siis tema vend sai Naraku etturiks. See ei olnud lihtne, ei saanud olla midagi, et lihtsalt keegi võiks silmitsi ja ikka edasi minna. Ta ikka naeratas, isegi kui see valu ja need meeldetuletused ... Ta oli sageli nii särav, isegi pimedamatel aegadel.<br/><br/>Ja just nüüd tahtis ta toetuda vanema naise küljele, et lohutada asjaolu, et ta oli seal ja ta toetas. Ta tundis, et Sango kuidagi tõmbab selle läbi ja pakub mõningaid jõu ja mõistmise sõnu. Need olid ajad, mis tegid need loitsud hullemaks, pidev meeldetuletus, et ta oli ilma oma perekonnata.<br/><br/>"Ma ei taha üksi olla." Ta nuttis valjusti oma üksinduses, duðði heli uppus argumendist.<br/><br/>Ta ei kartnud seda tunnistada.<br/><br/>夜明けの晩に<br/><br/>Veel üks tund oli möödunud, enne kui ta seda mõistis. Tema nahk oli veest külm ja tundus, nagu jää jookseks läbi tema veenide. Ta ei olnud aru saanud, et ta oli hakanud värisema, kuni tema käsi jõudis vee välja lülitada ja oma dušši lõpetada. Kagome ei otsinud enam peeglist omaenda pilku, vaid mähkis end rätikutesse ja kõndis vannitoast välja, trepist üles ja oma kööki. Ta alustas kerge hommikusöögi valmistamist, lugedes oma märkmeid päevast, mil toit keedeti.<br/><br/>Tema karjäär oli viimastel aastatel tõesti tõusuteel. Tema fotod olid esindatud paljudes galeriides, tema nimi hakkas sagedasti palju huuli neile, kes olid huvitatud fotograafiast.<br/><br/>Töö ta oli palunud kapriis oli vallandanud kõik. Ta oli olnud palju õnnelikum, kui ta oli oodanud, et olla selles maailmas. Kunagi õnnelik, et libiseda tagasi läbi praod oma maailma, kuid õnnelik, et teha hästi. Kui ta pliiti tagasi pöördus, meenus talle aeg, mil ta oli lõpuks koju naasmisest loobunud. See oli umbes kaks aastat tema elu siin, kui ta oli hakanud venture fotograafia rohkem kui lihtsalt hobi, kuid midagi, mida ta võiks teha nime ise.<br/><br/>See päev oli olnud eriti meeldiv, päike oli kõrgel taevas ja ta oli leidnud end pildistamas loodust. Väike poiss oli peidetud üks taim, ja ta oli püütud pilt hetkel tema nägu oli elanud rõõmsameelne, pahatahtlik naeratus hetkel, enne kui ta oli hüpanud välja ehmatada tema saagiks. See meenutas talle Shippou, väike kitsune, mille ta oli sisuliselt vastu võtnud. Ka tema oli oma perekonnast rebitud, kui nad esimest korda kohtusid. Tema isa tappis ja ta oli otsustanud talle kätte maksta. Kui ta oli noor, tundus ta oma esimestel kohtumistel nii küps.<br/><br/>Võib-olla oli see Inuyasha mõju, mis võimaldas komplektil uuesti käituda nagu laps, olla noor ja kapriisne aeg-ajalt, samal ajal kui teised olid küpsemad. Ta pakkus talle lohutust omal moel, ja ta püüdis hoolitseda tema eest, nagu ta oleks oma, kuigi ta oli nii noor siis ka. Kuid tema noorus ei takistanud teda mõistmast, kuidas teda hoolitseda või hoolitseda tema eest nagu tema laps. Tema süda paisus, kui ta naeratas, kui ta oli oma pliiatside kingituse üle nii õnnelik ja võttis aega kunsti tegemiseks. Ta oli iga joonistuse üle nii uhke, et ta oli lõpetanud, et ta teadis, et selline tunne oleks ema sellises olukorras.<br/><br/>Valu, mis oli rebitud läbi tema oli liiga palju, liiga äkki. Ta igatses teda ja tahtis näha, kui palju ta oli kasvanud, sest ta oli läinud. Ta oli igatsenud nii palju...<br/><br/>Et säästa end valust ja valedest lootustest, andis ta alla ja keskendus enese parandamisele.<br/><br/>鶴と亀が<br/><br/>Hommikusöök maitses pehme, igav ja inspireeritud. Alles pärast seda, kui ta oli lõpetanud, mõistis ta, et ta oli unustanud igasuguseid vürtse või maitset toidule. Nüüd oli juba liiga hilja, et seda meenutada, sest ta oli liiga hõivatud oma elu muude üksikasjade meenutamisega, mis olid ilmselgelt muutunud tema toidust tähtsamaks.<br/><br/>"Istu!"<br/><br/>Loomulikult ei juhtunud midagi, kui ta oli vihaselt karjunud ühele eriti masendavale kliendile, kes tuletas talle meelde pooldeemonit. Ta oli eriti kangekaelne ja ebaviisakas, soovides, et foto oleks tema viis, mitte lasknud sellel loomulikult töötada. Võite proovida sundida metsloomi käituma nii, nagu soovite. Kuid harva õnnestus keegi jõuga. Inuyasha ei olnud siiski nii halb. Inuyasha oli õppinud, enne kui ta oli temast eemale sunnitud. Ta oli muutunud õrnemaks, mõistvamaks, küpsemaks, kuigi oli aegu, mil ta oli ikka veel lapsik ja ülbe.<br/><br/>Ta mäletab, kui punased tema põsed olid põlenud, kuid kuidas ta seisis oma maapinnal ja vallandas teda. Ta ütles talle, et ta keeldus töötamast kellelegi või kellegagi, kes soovis midagi väljapoole loodust, kaugemale oma soove.<br/><br/>Ta oleks pidanud võrdlema meest Naraku asemel Inuyasha. Kuigi tema klient ei olnud selliseid äärmuslikke kavatsusi. Vähemalt tunne pärast oli meeldiv mälestus. Vabadus teada, et ta oli jõudnud nii kaugele, et ta võis keelduda tööst, mida ta ei tahtnud teha, olla tema enda isik, kes oli teistest sõltumatu. Ta võis öelda, et ta tegi seda sel hetkel. Kuigi ta kuulis kuulujutte päevi hiljem sõnadega, mis pidid teda laimama.<br/><br/>Ta kaitses ennast õiglaselt, nagu ta tegi oma teekonna lõpus. Lõppude lõpuks oli ta ainus, kes suutis ennast selles maailmas kaitsta.<br/><br/>滑った<br/><br/>Hommikuvalgus hakkas tema koju hiilima, tuletades talle jälle meelde aja möödumist. Jällegi pidas ta nimekirja asjadest, mida ta pidi tegema, ja arutas, kust alustada. Või kui ta peaks üldse alustama. Mis kuidas päev algas, ta ei tea, kas ta võiks kaaluda, et suur idee. See oli kahtlane, et ta oleks edukas, kui kadunud ise ta oli muutumas.<br/><br/>Ta ei tahtnud oma viimast tööd nässu keerata, sest ta oli seda varemgi teinud. Ei olnud meeldiv proovida ja täielikust katastroofist taastuda.<br/><br/>Kagome mäletas oma kalli, uhiuue, kaamera käest libisemise tunnet. Ta ei olnud valmis seda toetama, sest ta oli just selle kotist välja võtnud. Osa temast karjus sees. Dramaatiline, over-the-top, täis karjuma, et ta sageli tegi, kui ta oli palju, palju noorem. Kui ta oli hädas, et saada läbi keskkooli samas hüpped korda. Teine osa temast oli jäätunud paigale, samal ajal kui tema lääts oli täielikult purunenud ja ülejäänud kaamera oli koos sellega purunenud.<br/><br/>Nähes Inuyasha vend, täis deemon, seisab tema ees oli viimane asi, mida ta ootas, kui ta oli teinud oma väljapääs tema fotod. Ta seisis nii uhke kui kunagi varem, nii pikk kui kunagi varem, nii mõjukas kui ta mäletas. Ta ei paistnud olevat täiesti teistsuguses maailmas, kuigi ta ei olnud kunagi parim tema mõtete lugeja. Tema nimi huultel oli nii võimas, et ta mäletas väikseid tundeid nagu ta tegi. Tema huuled olid lõhenenud, tema suu tundus kuiv ja mullitav ärevustunne tema kõhus tegi ta haigeks.<br/><br/>Ta ei tahtnud, et tema lootused täituksid.<br/><br/>Aga ta tahtis, et ta oleks seal, isegi kui nad ei olnud sõbrad. Nad olid liitlased, kui midagi, sest nad olid võidelnud kõrvuti. Ja midagi oli parem kui absoluutselt mitte midagi.<br/><br/>Ja Kagome'il oli piisavalt mõistust, et mitte teda visata, et haarata oma käed tema ümber kergendusega, et teades, et ta ei olnud üksi. Tema kaamera ei olnud enam oluline, kui ta talle lähenes. Ta mäletas, et miski muu ei loenud päevi, kui ta veetis temaga aega, mitte ei rääkinud nende maailmast, vaid rääkis (või ta rääkis ja ta lihtsalt tunnistas seda fakti).<br/><br/>Kui täpselt ta armus teda kuigi... Kagome ei mäleta. See oli peen asi, nagu ta oli. Aga ta teadis tunne oli seal. Ja ta andis talle teada, et ta ei olnud üksi asjaolu, et ta oli langenud, et tunded olid kuidagi õitsenud.<br/><br/>後ろの正面<br/><br/>Tabas teda kaalutuse tunne ja äkki avanesid ta silmad, samal ajal kui ta meeleheitlikult küünistas viimast asja, mida ta tegi. Ta ei mäletanud, kui ta oli maganud oma diivanil, kuid ta teadis, et viimane koht, kus ta oli olnud, oli liiga mugavatel padjadel. Kuid ta ei võitlenud ega võitlenud kaalutusega, kui ta oli tuttavates kätes. Tema pea kallutas vastu Sesshumaru rindu, võttes lohutust asjaolust, et ta oli siin ja ta ei olnud üksi.<br/><br/>"Tere tulemast tagasi." Tema vastus oli vaikne tunnustus. Ta ei pidanud palju rääkima, et mõista oma kavatsust või muud, mida ta pidi ütlema.<br/><br/>Ta kandis teda tagasi oma voodisse, asustas teda sellesse kergusega. Tema silmad kohtusid temaga ja ta naeratas kergesti, sest rohkem mälestusi ei triivinud tagasi, rohkem mälestusi ei kiusanud teda. Ei, kui ta oli lähedal, ei langenud ta kunagi tagasi nendesse mõtetesse. Ta oli aidanud ja aastad olid aidanud. Täna oli lihtsalt üks neist päevadest.<br/><br/>"Uni." Ta käskis kergust, tema silmad veeresid teda, kuid ta ei võidelnud, sest ta oli väsinud. Tema käsi klammerdus tihedalt tema poole, samas kui ta tundis oma vastupidist kätt, mis surus tema otsmikule, hinnates tema heaolu.<br/><br/>"Ma olen korras," ütles ta, tema sõnad kindlalt oma lubadust.<br/><br/>Temaga oli kõik korras, ta oli elus ja õnnelik.<br/><br/>だあれ<br/><br/>kaubasaatja<br/><br/>kokkuvõte<br/><br/>Kagome, ühel hetkel oma elus, oli üsna tavaline teismeline tüdruk, kuni teda ründas deemon oma perekonna kaevumajas. Deemon tõmbas ta alla kaevu, mis maagiliselt kandis teda umbes 500 aastat minevikku. Seal sai ta teada, et tema keha sees on püha kalliskivi, kuna ta oli preestrinna reinkarnatsioon, kes oli surnud 50 aastat enne aega, kui ta lohistati. Juveel rebiti tema kehast ja deemon, kes teda ajas, võitis pooldeemon, kelle ta vabastas, kes oli puu külge kinnitatud. Kagome sõbrunes pooldeemoni Inuyashaga ajas ja reisis temaga, et taastada kalliskivi, mida ta ise purustas. Kuigi see ei olnud nii lihtne ja lihtne teha, kuna paljud deemonid ja inimesed otsisid kalliskivi oma eesmärkidel. Ta sõbrunes noore Kitsune deemoni, munga ja deemonitapjaga, kes kõik reisisid temaga juveeli taastamiseks.<br/><br/>Kuid tema grupp ei olnud see, kes juveeli lõpetas, vaid hoopis kuri pooldeemon, kes manipuleeris enamiku suurte sündmustega enamiku oma kaaslase elust. Kui ta lõpuks kogus kõik juveeli tükid ja tegi oma soovi rüvetatud objektile, tõmbas Kagome juveeli endasse kavatsusega teha isekas soov hoida teda igavesti lõksus, hoides juveeli elus. See oli Inuyasha kangekaelsus, mis suutis teda pimedusest päästa. Lõpuks naasis ta oma loomuliku aja juurde, lõpetas keskkooli, nagu tema ajajoone tüdruk ootas. Kuigi päeva hiljem jõudis Kagome Elysioni. Ta on olnud selles maailmas viis aastat ja on juba ammu loobunud koju naasmisest. Ta on asunud õnnelikult oma uude ellu.<br/><br/>platooniline<br/><br/>Kagome'il on üsna lihtne uusi sõpru leida, ta ei ole oma noorusest palju muutunud. Ta on rõõmsameelne noor naine, kes on empaatiline ja tervitatav kõige enam oma elus. Nooruses sõbrunes ta deemonitega, kui enamik neid kartis. Isegi deemonid, kes kasutasid süüa inimesi, ta on sõbrunenud ja ta muutis oma viise (ta tahaks mõelda). Sellest hoolimata on tõesti lihtne saada tema sõbraks, kui keegi suudab näidata, et nad on valmis lunastama või näitavad, et nad ei ole täiesti kurjad. Ta tunneb väga kõigile, kellega ta kohtub, nii et tal on raske mitte tõmmata teisi sooviga olla sõbrad.<br/><br/>antagonist<br/><br/>Ainus viis Kagome'i viha teenida on olla nii kahetsusväärne, nii kuri ja nii kaugel lunastusest, et ta ei näe sinus midagi head. Ja ta näeb head peaaegu kõigis ja kõiges. Ausalt, kellega ta on silmitsi seisnud? Pooldeemon, kes pani kaks armukest üksteise vastu, kes needis ühe oma sõbra kogu meesliini, ja lasi oma parima sõbra vennal tappa nende pere... Jah, ma ei näe, et ta vihkaks kedagi ilma nendeta, tegelikult töötaks selle nimel. Julgelt proovige seda siiski.<br/><br/>romantiline<br/><br/>Kui armunud, Kagome on tugev toetus, alati viibib seal isegi siis, kui asjad võivad olla karmid. Kuid Kagome ei otsi armastust, ei otsinud armastust, kui ta saabus, nii et varasemaid suhteid ei ole olemas. See ei tähenda, et keegi ei ole temasse armunud. Ta võib kindlasti olla kellegi vastutasutu armastuse teema, ta on tõenäoliselt selle kohta tähelepanuta. Lõpuks on Kagome praegu Sesshumaruga kihlatud, üllatavalt. Ma olen täiesti avatud võimalikele asjadele. <3<br/><br/>fandom helge<br/><br/>vanus iidne<br/><br/>liigid kosmosekuninganna<br/><br/>okupatsioonisurm<br/><br/>Eelistab teda/teda<br/><br/>Auhinnad<br/><br/>pro ta / tema est 62woo i imeda plot vastuseid. kuid ok niikuinii!!! neptune on väga sõbralik ja on, et "cool" persona, ta on tõesti lõbus olla ümber, ja ta on SUPER hea töötada. nagu ta on super patsient ja ta teeb kõike, mida ta temalt küsib - ta on tõesti lihtne töötada, kindlasti võrreldes teiste mudelitega. nii et ma armastan ideed, et nad kõik on esialgu töö orienteeritud sõbrad ja siis muutuvad millekski enamaks.

Tead, ta on ka laulja / esineja kohalikus teatris, nii et ma võin ette kujutada, et Kagome läheb sinna, et asju välja selgitada ja siis Elsa lava taga või midagi - ja siis võib sõprus õitseda sealt! Ma absoluutselt jumaldan ideed, et need kaks veedavad kvaliteetset bff aega koos, tehes väikseid, kuid lõbusaid asju, mida Elsa kunagi lapsena ei kogenud.

| Why You Should be on Twitter<br/><br/>Disclaimer: I am not, nor have I ever claimed to be, a social media guru. I'm just a person who thinks about stuff a lot, and this has come up a number of times.<br/><br/>I'm not an early adopter. Sometimes it takes me years to figure out what I want to use something for before I actually get on it, and Twitter was one of those things. I've been on Twitter seriously since about February of this year, so I'm pretty new at it. Still, I've learned a number of things, and I wanted to share them. Some people say I'm a Twitter pusher, and I am, because there's lots of good reasons to get on it, and virtually no downsides.<br/><br/>So what's Twitter? If you're on the internet, you've probably at least heard of it. It's a social media network that serves as a forum for conversations, updates, and news in a medium more public than something like Facebook or LinkedIn. Facebook is about who wants to find you, but Twitter is about who you want to find. Your favourite writers, actors, politicians, singers, and scientists are probably on Twitter. So are your favourite charities, radio stations, news sites, and stores. And they want you to find them and listen to what they have to say. Everyone on Twitter, at least initially, wants to talk with you.<br/><br/>But why join that? Why be a part of it? There's all kinds of reasons, and I'm going to give you a few.<br/><br/>People and Places Twitter is a great way to find out about events which are going on around the world, but also in your community. If you're travelling and looking for things to do, it's a great way to find out about things relevant to your interests (because the people you follow are people you're interested in). Even if you're not travelling, knowing about great places to go locally or knowing that people you're interested in are going to them creates an opportunity to meet them and create a deeper relationship with them. If you go back to my party post, all the people in it but two, I heard about on Twitter and then met in real life, and now we're pretty good friends. And the more you do this, the more things you'll find out about, and the more people you'll meet. And if you follow them on Twitter, you already know a bit about what they're like. They want you to. The reverse is also true, because tweeting invites people to see what you're like, and they can make the same choices about you.<br/><br/>Inspiration and Motivation<br/>Inspiration comes from the strangest places, and the influx of tweets means there's always fresh content for your imagination. I have a follow first policy, so I'll follow just about anybody, and then periodically go through and unfollow people. I don't know who's going to plant the seed of a new blog post or new project in me, so I like to keep my options open. Motivation also happens, because Twitter is just like life. If you surround yourself with people who are ambitious, dedicated, generous, and hard-working, it's easier to be like that, and push yourself. It's easier to think that if they can plan events, launch projects, or just get up in the morning, well, so can you.<br/><br/>Learning and Lifestyle Bloggers are on Twitter. Bloggers who aren't may actually be crazy. And people blog about just about everything. If you're looking to learn something, odds are good that somebody's tweeting about it. On top of that, news services and stores are also connected, which means that you can get your news up to the minute, and find out about sales and deals as they start.As far as lifestyle, looking for new recipe ideas? Follow some caterers and see what they come up with. Need a twist for that cocktail party? Twitter's got people for that too. Wardrobe recommendations, or just want to see what other people are doing with their lives? It's all there.<br/><br/>There are some common challenges I face when talking about this, and they're legitimate obstacles. It can seem pretty daunting, especially if you're getting on the bandwagon late, like I did. I spent months following only two people and not knowing what else to do. But there are ways to overcome them, and hear they are from least frequent to most.<br/><br/>#3: Twitter is for Narcissistic Jerks<br/>I think this comes from the idea that most people tweet for and about themselves as a way of getting attention. What I don't get is why there's anything wrong with that, or why doing that makes one a narcissist or a jerk. If someone has something to say, they want to be heard. Used to be you'd stand on the street corner and yell. Now you can yell in 140 characters or less. Twitter's just a new way to be heard. Now, there are certainly narcissistic jerks on Twitter. They're pretty much everywhere. Sometimes, people are jerks. Sometimes one of those people is me, I'm sorry to say. Don't follow those people. If you don't like what someone is saying, whether that's points that they're making or detailed accounts of their bathroom activities, you don't have to listen on Twitter.<br/><br/>#2: I Can't Keep Track of It All<br/>The second obstacle people often bring up is that they just don't have time to keep track of all the things which are going on on Twitter. And you know what? That's fine. Keep track of what you can. Maybe you only wander on every few days. If you're a private user (rather than tweeting for your company), and especially a beginner, that's okay. Part of something is better than all of nothing.<br/><br/>#1 I've Got Nothing I Want to Put Out There<br/>This is by far the most frequent challenge people raise. And it doesn't even matter. You don't have to join Twitter to talk. Join it to listen. Again, your favourite authors, singers, bloggers, and newspapers are on here. This is your chance to listen to them. It's your chance to gain a window into their lives and activities, and they're inviting you to do that. Want to find out what Felicia Day is going to be up to at the San Diego Comic Con? Done. I know people who only listen on Twitter, and that's great. That's what I did for a while. Eventually, maybe you'll find something to tweet about, or make something to tweet about. I hope you do, because I want to hear about it.<br/><br/>In short, if you're not using Twitter, I think you should be. If you're not using it to its full extent, try to. Don't be afraid to follow five hundred people, if all of those people are saying things you're interested in. Invite those people into bits of your life, and see how it's improved by the interaction. I look forward to hearing from you. | Miks sa peaksid olema Twitteris<br/><br/>Disclaimer: Ma ei ole, ega ole kunagi väitnud, et olen sotsiaalmeedia guru. Ma olen lihtsalt inimene, kes mõtleb asju palju, ja see on tulnud mitu korda.<br/><br/>Ma ei ole varajane lapsendaja. Mõnikord kulub mul aastaid, et aru saada, mida ma tahan midagi kasutada, enne kui ma tegelikult selle peale jõuan, ja Twitter oli üks neist asjadest. Ma olen Twitteris tõsiselt alates selle aasta veebruarist, nii et ma olen üsna uus. Ikka, ma olen õppinud mitmeid asju, ja ma tahtsin jagada neid. Mõned inimesed ütlevad, et ma olen Twitter tõukaja, ja ma olen, sest seal on palju häid põhjuseid, et saada seda, ja praktiliselt ei ole miinuseid.<br/><br/>Nii et mis on Twitter? Kui olete Internetis, olete ilmselt vähemalt kuulnud sellest. See on sotsiaalmeedia võrgustik, mis toimib vestluste, värskenduste ja uudiste foorumina, mis on rohkem avalik kui Facebook või LinkedIn. Facebook on umbes kes tahab leida sind, kuid Twitter on umbes kes sa tahad leida. Teie lemmik kirjanikud, näitlejad, poliitikud, lauljad ja teadlased on ilmselt Twitter. Nii on ka teie lemmik heategevusorganisatsioonid, raadiojaamad, uudiste saidid ja kauplustes. Ja nad tahavad, et sa leiaksid nad ja kuulaksid, mida neil on öelda. Kõik Twitteris, vähemalt esialgu, tahavad sinuga rääkida.<br/><br/>Aga miks liituda sellega? Miks olla osa sellest? Seal on igasuguseid põhjuseid ja ma annan teile mõned.<br/><br/>Inimesed ja kohad Twitter on suurepärane võimalus teada saada sündmusi, mis toimuvad kogu maailmas, vaid ka oma kogukonnas. Kui reisite ja otsite asju, mida teha, on see suurepärane võimalus teada saada oma huvidega seotud asjadest (kuna inimesed, keda järgite, on inimesed, kellest olete huvitatud). Isegi kui te ei reisi, teades suurepäraseid kohti, kuhu minna, või teades, et inimesed, kellest olete huvitatud, lähevad neile, loob võimaluse nendega kohtuda ja luua nendega sügavamad suhted. Kui sa lähed tagasi minu peopostituse juurde, kõik inimesed peale kahe, ma kuulsin sellest Twitteris ja siis kohtusime reaalses elus, ja nüüd oleme päris head sõbrad. Ja mida rohkem sa seda teed, seda rohkem asju sa saad teada ja rohkem inimesi sa kohtud. Ja kui te järgite neid Twitteris, siis teate juba natuke, millised nad on. Nad tahavad, et sa oleksid. Vastupidine on ka tõsi, sest tweeting kutsub inimesi nägema, milline sa oled, ja nad saavad sinu kohta samu valikuid teha.<br/><br/>Inspiratsioon ja motivatsioon<br/>Inspiratsioon pärineb kõige kummalisematest kohtadest ja tweetide sissevool tähendab, et teie kujutlusvõime jaoks on alati värske sisu. Mul on esimene poliitika, nii et ma järgin peaaegu kõiki, ja seejärel perioodiliselt läbi ja inimeste järgi. Ma ei tea, kes istutab minusse uue blogipostituse või uue projekti seemne, nii et mulle meeldib hoida oma võimalusi avatuna. Motivatsioon ka juhtub, sest Twitter on nagu elu. Kui ümbritsete ennast inimestega, kes on ambitsioonikad, pühendunud, helded ja töökad, on lihtsam olla selline ja suruda ennast. Lihtsam on mõelda, et kui nad saavad üritusi planeerida, projekte käivitada või lihtsalt hommikul üles tõusta, siis saate ka teie.<br/><br/>Õppimine ja elustiil Bloggers on Twitteris. Bloggers, kes ei ole võib-olla tegelikult hull. Ja inimesed blogi peaaegu kõike. Kui otsite õppida midagi, koefitsiendid on hea, et keegi on tweeting selle kohta. Lisaks sellele on ühendatud ka uudisteteenused ja -poed, mis tähendab, et saate oma uudiseid minutiga kätte saada ja tutvuda müügi ja tehingutega, kui need algavad. Jälgi mõned toitlustajad ja vaata, mida nad tulevad välja. Kas vajate twist, et kokteili poole? Twitter on inimesed, et liiga. Riidekapp soovitused, või lihtsalt tahad näha, mida teised inimesed teevad oma eluga? See kõik on seal.<br/><br/>On mõned ühised väljakutsed, millega ma silmitsi seisan, kui sellest räägin, ja need on seaduslikud takistused. See võib tunduda üsna hirmutav, eriti kui sa jõuad vankrisse hilja, nagu ma tegin. Ma veetsin kuid järgides ainult kahte inimest ja ei teadnud, mida muud teha. Kuid on olemas viise, kuidas neist üle saada ja kuulda, et nad on kõige vähem sagedased.<br/><br/># 3: Twitter on nartsissistlike jobude jaoks<br/>Ma arvan, et see tuleneb ideest, et enamik inimesi säutsub enda jaoks ja enda kohta, et saada tähelepanu. Mida ma ei saa aru, miks selles on midagi valesti, või miks seda tehes teeb üks nartsissist või jobu. Kui kellelgi on midagi öelda, tahavad nad kuulda. Varem seisid tänavanurgal ja karjusid. Nüüd saate karjuda 140 tähemärki või vähem. Twitter on lihtsalt uus viis kuulda. Nüüd on Twitteris kindlasti nartsissistlikud jobud. Nad on peaaegu kõikjal. Mõnikord on inimesed jobud. Mõnikord olen üks neist inimestest, mul on kahju öelda. Ära järgne neile inimestele. Kui teile ei meeldi, mida keegi ütleb, kas see on punkte, mida nad teevad, või üksikasjalikke aruandeid oma vannitoa tegevuste kohta, ei pea te Twitteris kuulama.<br/><br/># 2 Ma ei saa seda kõike jälgida.<br/>Teine takistus, mida inimesed sageli esile tõstavad, on see, et neil pole lihtsalt aega jälgida kõiki asju, mis Twitteris toimuvad. Ja tead mis? See on hea. Jälgige, mida saate. Võib-olla ainult iga paari päeva tagant. Kui olete erakasutaja (mitte oma ettevõtte tweeting) ja eriti algaja, on see okei. Osa millestki on parem kui mitte midagi.<br/><br/># 1 Mul ei ole midagi, mida ma tahan sinna panna.<br/>See on ülekaalukalt kõige sagedasem väljakutse, mida inimesed esitavad. Ja see ei ole isegi oluline. Sa ei pea Twitteriga rääkima. Liituge kuulama. Jällegi on siin teie lemmikautorid, lauljad, blogijad ja ajalehed. See on teie võimalus kuulata neid. See on teie võimalus saada aken oma elu ja tegevuse, ja nad kutsuvad teid seda tegema. Tahad teada saada, mida Felicia päev on kuni San Diego Comic Con? Valmis. Ma tean inimesi, kes ainult kuulata Twitter, ja see on suurepärane. See on see, mida ma tegin mõnda aega. Lõpuks, võib-olla leiad midagi säutsuma umbes, või teha midagi säutsuma umbes. Loodan, et sa seda, sest ma tahan kuulda.<br/><br/>Lühidalt, kui te ei kasuta Twitterit, ma arvan, et peaksite olema. Kui te ei kasuta seda täies ulatuses, proovige seda. Ärge kartke järgida viitsada inimest, kui kõik need inimesed ütlevad asju, millest olete huvitatud. Kutsuge neid inimesi oma elu osadesse ja vaadake, kuidas see suhtlemine on seda parandanud. Ootan teie sõnu. |
| Root Canals<br/><br/>The very thought of getting a root canal puts most people on edge. SCM Dental utilizes the latest technology and technique to make a root canal a virtually pain free and low stress procedure.<br/><br/>Rotary endodontics is an advanced technology and technique to perform endodontic treatment, the clinical term for a root canalThe term "root canal" refers to the natural cavity at the center of the tooth. The tooth's nerve is located in soft tissue (pulp) inside the root canal. If the tooth is damaged either by trauma or decay, debris can enter the sensitive root canal area and cause an infection, or in extreme circumstances, and abscess. An abscessed tooth is very serious and should be treated as an emergency, as it can create an infection that may spread to other parts of the body. If you believe you have an abscessed tooth, contact our office immediately to schedule emergency care.<br/><br/>Depending on the case, root canal therapy may require more than one visit. An initial x-ray will be taken to evaluate the tooth and root canal and determine the extent of the damage and infection if present. You will be given a form of anesthesia to make you relaxed.<br/><br/>When the area is numb, our dentist will create an access chamber to the root canal using an electric handpiece. Next, the root canal will be scraped of the infected or damaged tissue and nerve. Once the entire area has been throughly cleaned and polished, the tooth will be filled with a biocompatible rubber compound called gutta percha. The tooth is then covered with a dental filling or dental crown to restore strength and function.<br/><br/>Endodontic therapy has a bad reputation as being a painful procedure. With rotary endodontics, a root canal procedure is no more painful than having a dental filling placed. The infection and damage to the nerve is what creates the extreme pain and discomfort and patients you will experience significant relief after undergoing root canal therapy. Root canals have a success rate of 95% and allow people to preserve their natural teeth. | Juurkanalid<br/><br/>SCM Dental kasutab uusimat tehnoloogiat ja tehnikat, et muuta juurekanal praktiliselt valuvabaks ja madala stressiga protseduuriks.<br/><br/>Rotary endodontia on arenenud tehnoloogia ja tehnika endodontilise ravi läbiviimiseks, juurekanali kliiniline termin Termin "juurkanal" viitab hamba keskel asuvale looduslikule õõnsusele. Hamba närv asub juurekanali sees pehmes koes (pulp). Kui hammas on kahjustatud kas trauma või lagunemise tõttu, võib praht tungida tundlikku juurekanali piirkonda ja põhjustada infektsiooni või äärmuslikel asjaoludel ja abstsess. Abstsesshammas on väga tõsine ja seda tuleks käsitleda hädaolukorrana, kuna see võib tekitada infektsiooni, mis võib levida teistesse kehaosadesse. Kui arvate, et teil on abstsesshammas, võtke kohe ühendust meie kontoriga, et määrata erakorralist ravi.<br/><br/>Sõltuvalt juhtumist võib juurekanali ravi vajada rohkem kui ühte visiiti. Hamba ja juurekanali hindamiseks ning kahjustuse ja nakkuse ulatuse määramiseks tehakse esmane röntgen. Teile antakse anesteesia vorm, mis teeb teid lõdvestunud.<br/><br/>Kui ala on tuimaks muutunud, loob hambaarst elektrilise käsitöö abil juurekanali juurde juurdepääsukambri, mille järel kaabitakse juurekanal nakatunud või kahjustatud kudedest ja närvidest. Kui kogu piirkond on täielikult puhastatud ja poleeritud, täidetakse hammas bioühilduva kummiühendiga, mida nimetatakse gutta perchaks. Seejärel kaetakse hammas hambatäidise või hambakrooniga, et taastada tugevus ja funktsioon.<br/><br/>Endodontilisel ravil on halb maine kui valulik protseduur. Pöörleva endodontoloogiaga ei ole juurekanali protseduur valusam kui hambatäidise asetamine.

| Churchyard Bottom Wood<br/><br/>Highgate<br/><br/>Churchyard Bottom Wood, Highgate<br/><br/>Now called Queen's Wood<br/><br/>Between 1860 and 1880 the centre was torn out of the City of London to build sewers, railways and new roads. Houses were demolished without regard for the tenants who had to find whatever accommodation they could elsewhere. Managers went to livo in Kensington and St. John's Wood, while the poorest crowded into the rookeries like Seven Dials and Lisson Grove. For those between, the clerks and skilled workmen, speculative builders put up row after row of terraced villas and Mr Pooter moved into Holloway. The people of Muswell Hill watched houses creep across the fields of Finsbury Park, up Crouch Hill and down the other side, so that by 1880, Crouch End was being developed and there seemed no way to stem the flow. Ten years later the large estates of Muswell Hill were being sold. Upton Farm was sold and the Ecclesiastical Commissioners wanted to develop Churchyard Bottom Wood, now called Queen's Wood. The story would have made an Ibsen play. Two groups of honest, highly motivated people fighting for what they each thought was right. The Ecclesiastical Commissioners on the one hand and the Committee of the Hornsey Charities on the other, both believed they were doing their best for other people, and the public rose against them both in indignation<br/><br/>At that time Muswell Hill Road was a country road, with Southwood Hall at one end and Upton Farm at the other. By 1894, Onslow Gardens was built, Connaught Gardens marked out, and builders were poised to develop the Woodlands estate. Cut out of Churchyard Bottom Wood was a group of tumble-down cottages, on a triangular site. An undated map, held by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners shows six Wasteland Cottages with an opening between them - not a road, not metalled, but a way through to the strawberry beds behind. Further along was another gap which led to footpaths through the wood. These two openings were to be the basis of the plan. The same two gaps and the cleared ground, which was the strawberry field, can be seen in the 1894 map below. They are shown as 'Muswell Hill Cottages' and, quite in passing, Peter Sellers was to live on the same site much later on. To develop the wood as a housing estate, the Commissioners needed to drive two roads through from Muswell Hill Road and build houses along them. The Muswell Hill Road frontage alone would not have provided room for enough houses to make the venture worthwhile.<br/><br/>The land and cottages had been given much earlier as almshouses to house old people and were held on their behalf by the Trustees of the Hornsey Charity Commissioners. By the 1890s the cottages were tumble-down, in need of major repair. Public-spirited, wishing to do the best for their old tenants, the Trustees could not improve them since they had no money. Some years before the Ecclesiastical Commissioners had planned to develop Gravel Pit Wood (now Highgate Wood) as a housing estate, but this had met such opposition that they backed down. Instead, in 1886, they gave all 69 acres woodland to the public. At the same time they offered to sell Churchyard Bottom Wood to Hornsey Urban District Council for £25,000, but this was too much for Hornsey to raise on its own. The Council said that people living outside Hornsey also enjoyed the wood and other authorities should help, but no help was given. In the end the offer fell into abeyance.<br/><br/>Map showing the Muswell Hill Cottages which were the centre of the controversy.<br/><br/>Muswell Hill Road about 1880<br/><br/>It seems probable that these three pairs of cottages<br/>were the ones at the centre of the dispute.<br/><br/>The Ecclesiastical Commissioners wanted to raise money for its church work in Britain and abroad. They considered that they had been given the land to be used for the propogat­ion of religion and if this meant selling off land or woods, it was a lesser evil than restricting the work of the church. They had given Gravel Pit Wood to the public: in its place they would develop Churchyard Bottom Wood.<br/><br/>The Trustees of the Hornsey Charities wanted to produce an income to help their poor people, so they made an offer to the Commissioners. Their triangular piece of land was too awkwardly shaped to be developed economically, but if the Commissioners would grant them some more land to make it into a square site, they would build twenty-five neat villas. These would bring in ground rents of £225 per annum, which could be used to relieve the poverty of Hornsey people. In return they would permit the Commission­ers to cut two roads through their land so that the Commissioners could develop the woods.<br/><br/>When this offer became known people immediately reacted with alarm.<br/><br/>On the 16th December 1893 Mr Carvell Williams MP asked in the House of Commons, if the Ecclesiastical Commissioners had consented to sell a strip of land to the Hornsey Charities Trustees on condition that an existing road be widened to 40 feet, whether this was a preliminary to a building scheme and if the House of Parliament would have an opportunity to express an opinion.<br/><br/>Mr Leveson Gower, a Church Estates Commissioner replied',"Yes" to the first part.<br/><br/>Mr Carvell Williams, "Do I understand it is the intention to destroy that portion of Highgate Woods by building on it?"<br/><br/>Two days later The Star published an article worthy of any modern tabloid.<br/><br/>The Star<br/>18th December 1893<br/><br/>'Parliament must keep a keen watch on those old vandals and confederates of the jerry-builder the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. They are always alienating some piece of land or are favouring the builders as opposed to the general public. The Commissioners would not sell the Churchyard Bottom wood to the ratepayers but now propose 'to open it up' by cutting two wide roads through it in connection with one of their numerous building schemes. Will not someone ask a question in Parliament and check the brick and mortar policy of the Commissioners?'<br/><br/>By the time this was printed, the question had been asked and the answer was either untrue, or devious. Other papers took up the story. The Times, in a long report, said that the Comnussioners were not prepared to give an undertaking that Parliament, or any other public body, should have an opportunity of considering any scheme for building on the site of the wood.<br/><br/>The situation simmered for eighteen months until the Ecclesiastical Commissioners were forced to open an enquiry, which began at Highgate on 31 May 1895, chaired by an Assistant Ecclesiastical Commissioner. The Inquiry produced a flurry of newspaper letters of which this was the most important.<br/><br/>The Daily Chronicle, 5 June 1895<br/><br/>VANDALISM AT HIGHGATE<br/><br/>Sir –<br/><br/>One of the most lovely bits of woodland in suburan London is threatened. Will you help us to ward off what would be a calamity, not only to the immediate district, but to the whole of densely-populated North London? In no part of the metropolis has the builder been more active than in Crouch End and Hornsey. The beautiful meadows of a year or two ago are now houses and shops. Ballast heaps have taken the place of stately elms and chestnuts, and once pleasant villages are sharing the fate of Stroud Green, Harringay, Finsbury Park, Highbury and Islington. ---<br/><br/>---- The object is the construction of two forty-foot roads through the woods. We in this district know the meaning of forty-foot roads through woods. It means that the woods are doomed. Ten years ago agitation saved the sister-wood of sixty-five acres - The Gravel Pit Woods - and no one who saw the Bank Holiday crowds flocking up the Archway Road from the dreary streets of Holloway, Islington and Clerkenwell, and watched the keen enjoyment of the children and family parties picnicking on the grass and among the trees, could fail to realise the immense boon that the grant by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners of this wood has been to the whole of North London, but the Lower Wood of sixty acres has always been regarded as a natural complement of the other. ----<br/><br/>--- The Ecclesiastical Commissioners own nearly one-third of the large parish of Hornsey. By the liberal expenditure of the ratepayers' money in the opening up of roads and the general development of the district, the value of their property has been enormously increased, and from this unearned increment they each year draw large revenues. Surely the ratepayers whose money has thus aided in creating the immense estate may expect liberal treatment in return. ---<br/><br/>Yours obediently,<br/><br/>Signed by The Vicar of St James', Muswell Hill, the Minister of Park Chapel, Crouch End, a barrister living in Onslow Gardens and three members of the District Council.<br/><br/>It was a shot right across the bows of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. Their own religious leaders and the District Council, all up in arms saying in effect that the church was too rich and should be charitable, not greedy. The inclusion of the two clergymen was a shrewd move. Remember to that this was still in the height of the Darwin controversy. Darwin had split belief in the teachings of the Church and many people would have resented the power of the Church from that point of view alone. The Church was not so secure as it pretended to be.<br/><br/>The Evening News, 7 June 1895 said:-<br/><br/>"If the Ecclesiastical Comnussioners are not tackled at once, the building octopus will get a grip of the wood which will be very difficult to loosen later on, ---. Therefore it behoves Londoners to be up and doing if they would save one of their most delightful bits of rustic scenery. The public inquiry stands adjourned to Thursday next, and before then something must be done to convince the Commissioners that the citizens of London will not tolerate the confiscation of one of their favourite playgrounds."<br/><br/>A letter in the Daily Chronicle the next day said:-<br/><br/>.... It was with great relief that that the residents, some ten years ago, heard that the purchase of the Upper Wood had been effected; and how delightful a boon this has proved, anyone who visited them can testify, but all who exerted themselves to save these upper woods, which lie on the west side of Muswell Hill road, felt that their victory was incomplete so long as the sixty acres on the east side remained in danger. It is, as it were, an accident that the woods are divided by a broad high road. Can anyone doubt what the effect would be if the Churchyard Bottom Wood were replaced by rows of small villas, each sending out its contribution of smoke and soot? Can anyone doubt, too, the serious difference it would make to the picturesque setting of the purchased woods if a line of staring new houses were to be run up right over against their leafy frontage?'<br/><br/>This expressed the opinions of many people. In fact, the Gravel Pit Wood, which the writer calls the 'Upper Wood', had not been purchased, but given to the district by the Ecclesiastical Commission, a point they were to reiterate time and again over the years, but most people ignored it. The Commission was not going to give away a second wood whatever anyone said, and held this position to the end.<br/><br/>H.S.Chamberlain, of 5 Cranley Gardens,<br/>in a letter to the Times dated June 8, 1895, urged purchase.<br/><br/>I know that it is common to speak harshly of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, but as the trustees of a fund they are bound to administer it to the greatest advantage, and therefore, if anything is to be done to save the demolition of the wood, it appears to me that it can only be effected by the purchase of the property from the Comnussioners, who I know, are fully alive to the protection of free and open spaces for the people, and who, I feel sure, would be disposed to treat the matter of a purchase in a free and liberal spirit, as they have already done in the matter of the Shepherd's Cot-field, by granting a lease to the Crouch End Playing-fields Company - a small company in which I own a few shares, a small company which was formed exclusively for the purpose of securing the fields for cricket, tennis etc.<br/><br/>(This refers the the Crouch End Playing Fields which had been secured a few years later.)<br/><br/>As Chairman of the Muswell Hill Conservative Association, I am constantly in touch with the inhabitants, and I can safely affirm that every person resident in the neighbourhood would do anything in reason to preserve.<br/><br/>(All he wanted personally was Charity income to support his poor people. He demanded his acre of land - not a great deal surely - he believed the Commissioners' assurance that the wood was not in danger.)<br/><br/>' Muswell Hill Road was one of the best in Hornsey and would remain equally beautiful, houses or no houses',<br/><br/>(and then came the great rhetorical flourish.)<br/><br/>'Are the poor to suffer because of the sentimental objections and the hysterical cry of 'wolf just raised by your correspondents? Something must be done and that soon. An acre of back-land added to the charity-estate would make no apprec­iable difference to the land remaining, while the profit derived from it would succour many poor old and deserving persons in their declining years and enable us to hand over to our successors an estate which in the distant future would be of great value in the rendering of charitable aid to the deserving poor of the parish of Hornsey.'<br/><br/>Reading his letter one senses hysteria very near the surface. Why did he think the Commissioners wanted to build a road? Why should they spend all that money if not to build houses? He never seemed to realise that for an acre of land the the whole wood would be lost. But he had been with the problem for a long time. He was the person to whom the Commissioners had made the offer of sale for £25,000 years before and it is his name which is honoured in a plaque on Crouch End Clock Tower for saving the wood, but his trust in the Ecclesiastical Commissioners seems naive. It is sad that at the Inquiry he was to be cast as the devil.<br/><br/>The Inquiry Continued<br/><br/>The adjourned opened in Highgate on 15 June 1895. Expecting a large gather­ing, the Council Chamber had been changed completely. The usual tables had been removed and the room filled with chairs. By half past seven the room was crowded, with people jostling for seats.<br/><br/>Mr Murray, the Commissioner, said the Inquiry was really a simple one. Hornsey Parochial Charities wished to purchase a piece of land adjoining their charity property at the back. The question was whether the Charity Commission, which controlled all charities, had enough power to stop them. The Church Commissioners were prepared to sell the land at very favourable terms and the income of the Charity would be very considerable increased.<br/><br/>Against this there were three classes of objection.<br/><br/>The original Trust was for the purpose of providing cottages for the Poor, but the trustees were proposing to build villas which would be too expensive for the Poor. However, it was within the power of the Trustees to vary the terms of the Trust, so they could build villas if they thought that the Poor would benefit in the end. The poor people themselves might object, but liberal provisions had already been promised for them. The third objection related to the aesthetic and public side of the question. He took it from what he had read that the Charity Commission ought to interfere to prevent the Ecclesiastical Commissioners from exercising their own discretion in dealing with their own property.<br/><br/>The Inquiry discussed fine points, but the speakers kept coming back to the major problem of preventing any destruction of the wood. The Vestry Clerk of Islington, representing 300,000 people, made a formal protest about any part of the wood, so valuable for the people of Islington and Hornsey being used for private purposes. Mr Wilfred White said that if the Commissioners would give them time they would be able to raise the money to compensate the Trustees.<br/><br/>Mr Beaumont said they did not want villas, they wanted cottages for poor people who were being driven out of the district. Others said that there was no money to build cottages to replace the present delapidated ones but villas would be an economic proposition. Others retorted that there were score of villas to let in Highgate. The Wood was sacred. Stick to the question of the Wood.<br/><br/>Dr Fletcher said the cry among the working people was that there was nowhere to go. Working people came to him with the cry, "We are driven out of Highgate and are obliged to go to Highgate New Town." If the Muswell Hill Road frontage was sold there was no question but that roads might be cut right through the woods in the direction of Hornsey, but if the Commissioners could not get the land from the Charity Commission they could not cut the road.<br/><br/>He was very sure the cottages could be put into a fit state of repair. He was asked by the poor people, by the police and by a number of the working classes to represent these two points, that cottage accommodation was very sorely needed in Highgate and that if they once allowed the land to be sold, there was no telling where the hand of the builder would be stayed.<br/><br/>(Loud and prolonged cheers).<br/><br/>Numerous other people spoke and the Comnussioner summed up by saying that he took it that the prevailing opinion was in favour of retaining the cottages but the meeting should draw no conclusions from what he had said (Groans).<br/><br/>Others said that the Trustees of the Charity had failed in their duties by letting the the cottages fall into disrepair.<br/><br/>Mr H.R.Williams, the Trustee who had written to the paper earlier, said that he had it on the best authority that the Church Commissioners would make no roads whatever and they would not be benefitted one iota by the actions of the Charity Commissioners. Others were far less trusting and the meeting closed after nearly three hours.<br/><br/>'We are faced with the fact that in Highgate and Muswell Hill there are a number of persons who want the Churchyard Bottom Wood and will not be happy until they have got it - while nobody appears willing to spend a farthing to pay for it. Everyone says it would be a fine thing to have the wood as open space, but everybody thinks it is the duty of someone else to make it one. The Islington Vestry has 'resolved' on the subject, but the Islington Vestry does not offer a penny piece towards the purchase. --- There is no more difficult problem for the community or the individual to solve than how to gain possession of other people's property without paying for it.'<br/><br/>Paying for it was indeed the problem as Churchyard Bottom Wood became the subject of intense local and national debate. A joint committee was formed to raise money to save the wood. On 20 November 1896, C.F.Cory-Wright, Hon Treasurer, wrote to The Standard, a daily paper at that time, appealing for help. He reminded everyone of the danger of losing the wood and said it could only be saved by buying it. The Church Commissioners would sell for £25,000 and an extra (5,000 would be required for fencing and drainage, making a total of £30,000. This was too much for Hornsey Council to raise but they had already voted £10,000 towards the total. The woods were of inestimable value to all of North London so he appealed to public bodies and private people to raise the remaining £20,000. He warned that the present offer from the Church Commissioners was open only to the end of 1898. After that the builders would move in.<br/><br/>The appeal was warmly welcomed by the press. A Private Bill was rushed through Parliament and the Highgate Woods Preservation Act, 1897, became law. The Conunittee now had the right to advertise for contributions towards buying the Wood and preserving it.<br/><br/>In a fairly short time almost all the money was raised, but the last few thousand proved very difficult to raise and the Commissioners' deadline was a matter of weeks away. Mr Cory-Wright wrote pleading for more time but was granted a mere three months and then only if interest at 4 per cent was paid for the extra period on the full sum. In the end the London County Council, which had originally offered £2,500, made this up to £5,000 and the total was reached, but it was a close-run thing.<br/><br/>The Council decided to re-name the Wood as 'Queen's Woods' in honour of Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee and Hornsey put on a fine display of bunting when the Duchess of Albany formally declared the Wood open 'for the free use of the public for ever'.<br/><br/>While the campaign to save Churchyard Bottom Wood was run and directed by local people who felt passionately about this particular piece of woodland, they called on the help and experience of a vast network of people, some of whom had worked together on similar campaigns for over thirty years. The Committee issued an appeal, printed on very good quality paper and bearing some famous names.<br/><br/>The questions of open space and public health were major subjects of the Victorian vision.<br/><br/>The Open Spaces Movement<br/><br/>Octavia Hill, the great housing reformer, who had begun with three old houses in Marylebone, bought for her by Jolm Ruskin, had quickly become an expert on housing poor people in the healthiest conditions possible. Her way was to buy leases and then knock down some of the crowded houses in order to bring light and air to the rest, believing that fresh air and sunlight were the the only way poor people could be saved from 'putrid fever. She had learnt this as a child from her grandfather, Southwood Smith, who developed his theories at the Fever Hospital at King's Cross.<br/><br/>He had built the first Industrial Dwellings for poor people and had proved statistically that good air and decent drainage saved lives. Gibson Gardens, in Northwold Road, is a direct outcome of Southwood Smith's ideas. More Information on Gibson Gardens<br/><br/>The Importance of Open Air<br/><br/>Open spaces and the opportunity to breathe clean air, were essential for people living in one or two crowded rooms. Octavia Hill took her charges from the Lisson Grove slums, up Fitzjohn's Avenue to Hampstead Heath. She so loved the Fitzjohn's Avenue fields that she tried to buy them as a public park. They were to cost £10,000 and within three August weeks £8,500 had been raised. It needed only the end of the summer holidays and the return from holiday of sympathetic friends and the further £1,500 would have been raised, but the owners suddenly withdrew their offer. Despite all pleading, the fields were covered with large houses.<br/><br/>From this developed the campaign to save Parliament Hill, the next open space northwards from Lisson Grove, buying up fields in the path of the builders to make a permanent cordon sanitalre against the advancing bricks. The Parliament Hill Fields campaign was so successful that the Hampstead Heath Bill was passed and there was money over from the appeal. From this money and the impetus towards open spaces, was to develop the National Trust. Octavia Hill had been interested in protecting areas like Church Bottom Wood for years, so she was a natural ally in the fight to save the Wood.<br/><br/>The Commons Preservation Society also, was familiar with this kind of agitation and money collection. They had torn down fencing when lords of the manor had enclosed pieces of common land, leading both legal and illegal battles against the arrogant privatization of land traditionally free. Robert Hunter, their Honorary Solicitor from 1868, was always concerned with securing open spaces, large or small, for the public. He, now Sir Robert Hunter, became the Chairman of the Church Bottom Appeal. The Chairman of the Commons Preservation Society was Mr Shaw-Lefevre MP (later Lord Eversley) who played a big part in this and other campaigns in the House of Commons. Octavia Hill had been involved in their work from about 1875.<br/><br/>At the same time Octavia Hill was campaigning for a Burials Bill.<br/><br/>City churchyards had become so full and such a serious a hazard to health, by contaminating wells from which people drew their drinking water, that City burials were no longer permitted. Instead, cemetries were created on the outskirts of town. Abney Park Cemetary was one of these. There was then a movement to remove the headstones to the edges of the old town cemetries, re-inter the bodies elsewhere and turn the cemetries into gardens and open spaces, instead of building on them. This land in the centre of London was very valuable and speculators were avid to obtain it: Even the Quakers had built over one of their cemetries and threatened to do so again by building over Bunhill Fields. Octavia Hill had a network of allies in a dozen fields, so her help to save the Church Bottom Wood must have been invaluable.<br/><br/>The Metropolitan Gardens Society, set up in 1882, had laid out about two hundred small gardens in city centres by 1890. They later handed them over to the Local Authorities, so their support for the Churchyard Bottom Wood Appeal was assured from the start.<br/><br/>The Kyrle Society is forgotten now, but in its day had great influence on Town Planning and Open Space legislation. The Society had been set up about 1875 for 'the Diffusion of Beauty', to bring colour and interest into the lives of people living in dull, drab surroundings. Bright colour to walls and decoration, good singing, open spaces, Nature, Literature and Art. All these fell within the Society's remit. There was a Decorative Branch, for whom William Morris lectured; a Musical Branch to promote choirs and Happy Evenings for people in local school buildings; and a Literature Branch. The Society appealed regularly by letters in The Times, to 'the richer classes' for books and periodicals to be distributed to boys' and girls' clubs, almshouses and elsewhere. However the Open Spaces Committee was the most active. The very name 'Kyrle' came from Pope's The Man of Ross, the philanthropist who gave his birthplace to the people as a public park. | Churchyard Bottom Wood<br/><br/>Highgate<br/><br/>Linna Churchyard Bottom Wood hotellid<br/><br/>Nüüd nimetatakse kuninganna puit<br/><br/>Aastatel 1860–1880 rebiti keskus Londoni linnast välja, et ehitada kanalisatsioone, raudteid ja uusi teid. Majad lammutati üürnikest hoolimata, kes pidid mujalt leidma mis tahes majutuse. Juhid läksid Kensingtoni ja St. John's Woodi livosse, samas kui kõige vaesemad tungisid rookeries nagu Seven Dials ja Lisson Grove. Nende vahel, ametnikud ja oskustöölised, spekulatiivsed ehitajad panid rida rida rida rida villad ja hr Pooter kolis Holloway. Muswell Hilli inimesed vaatasid maju üle Finsbury pargi väljade, üles Crouch Hilli ja alla teisele poole, nii et 1880. aastaks töötati Crouch End välja ja ei tundunud, et voolu peatada. Kümme aastat hiljem müüdi Muswell Hilli suured mõisad. Uptoni talu müüdi ja kiriklikud volinikud tahtsid arendada Churchyard Bottom Woodi, mida nüüd nimetatakse kuninganna puiduks. Lugu oleks teinud Ibseni mängu. Kaks gruppi ausaid, kõrgelt motiveeritud inimesi võitlevad selle eest, mida nad mõlemad õigeks pidasid. Kiriklikud volinikud ühelt poolt ja Hornsey heategevuskomitee teiselt poolt uskusid mõlemad, et nad teevad teiste inimeste heaks oma parima, ja avalikkus tõusis nende vastu mõlemad nördimuses.<br/><br/>Tol ajal oli Muswell Hill Road riigitee, mille ühes otsas oli Southwood Hall ja teises Uptoni talu. 1894. aastal ehitati Onslow Gardens, Connaughti aiad märgistati ja ehitajad olid valmis Woodlandsi kinnisvara arendama. Churchyard Bottom Wood oli grupp trummeldatud suvilaid kolmnurksel alal. Kiriklike volinike valduses oleval kaardil on kuus Wasteland Cottages, mille vahel on ava - mitte tee, mitte metallist, vaid tee maasika voodite taga. Edasi oli veel üks lüngad, mis viisid jalgteed läbi puidu. Need kaks avad pidid olema aluseks kava. Sama kaks lüngad ja puhastatud pinnas, mis oli maasika valdkonnas, võib näha 1894. kaardil allpool. Nad on näidatud kui "Muswell Hill Cottages" ja üsna möödaminnes, Peter Sellers pidi elama samal saidil palju hiljem. Puidu kui elamukinnisvara arendamiseks pidid volinikud sõitma läbi Muswell Hill Roadi kaks teed ja ehitama nendele majad. Ainuüksi Muswell Hill Roadi fassaad ei oleks andnud ruumi piisavalt majadele, et muuta ettevõtmine tasuvaks.<br/><br/>Maad ja suvilad anti palju varem almusmajadena vanade inimeste majutamiseks ja neid hoidsid nende nimel Hornsey heategevusvolinike usaldusisikud. 1890. aastateks olid suvilad suured remondivajadused. Avalikus vaimus, soovides teha oma vanade üürnike heaks parimat, ei saanud usaldusisikud neid parandada, kuna neil ei olnud raha. Mõni aasta enne seda, kui kiriklikud volinikud olid planeerinud arendada Kruusa Pit Wood (nüüd Highgate Wood) eluasemeks, kuid see oli kohanud sellist vastuseisu, et nad taganesid. Selle asemel andsid nad 1886. aastal kõik 69 aakrit metsamaad avalikkusele. Samal ajal pakkusid nad müüa Churchyard Bottom Woodi Hornsey linnaosanõukogule 25 000 naela eest, kuid see oli Hornsey jaoks liiga palju, et üksi tõsta. Nõukogu ütles, et väljaspool Hornseyt elavad inimesed nautisid ka puitu ja teised võimud peaksid aitama, kuid abi ei antud. Lõpuks jäi pakkumine seisma.<br/><br/>Kaart, mis näitab Muswell Hilli majakesi, mis olid vaidluse keskpunktiks.<br/><br/>Muswell Hill Road umbes 1880. aastal<br/><br/>Tundub tõenäoline, et vaidluse keskmes olid need kolm paari suvilaid.<br/><br/>Kiriklikud volinikud tahtsid koguda raha oma kirikutööks Suurbritannias ja välismaal. Nad arvasid, et neile oli antud maa, mida kasutada religiooni propogaatikaks, ja kui see tähendas maa või metsa müümist, oli see väiksem kurjus kui kiriku töö piiramine. Nad olid andnud Gravel Pit Woodi avalikkusele: selle asemel arendasid nad Churchyard Bottom Woodi.<br/><br/>Hornsey heategevusorganisatsioonide usaldusisikud tahtsid oma vaeste inimeste aitamiseks tulu teenida, nii et nad tegid volinikele pakkumise. Nende kolmnurkne maatükk oli liiga ebamugavalt kujundatud, et seda majanduslikult arendada, kuid kui volinikud annaksid neile rohkem maad, et muuta see ruuduks, ehitaksid nad kakskümmend viis puhast villat. Need tooksid kaasa maa rendi 225 naela aastas, mida saaks kasutada Hornsey inimeste vaesuse leevendamiseks. Vastutasuks lubaksid nad komisjonil lõigata kaks teed läbi nende maa, et volinikud saaksid metsa arendada.<br/><br/>Kui see pakkumine sai teada, reageerisid inimesed kohe häirega.<br/><br/>16. detsembril 1893 küsis Carvell Williams parlamendi alamkojas, kas kiriklikud volinikud olid nõustunud müüma riba maad Hornsey heategevuslikele usaldusisikutele tingimusel, et olemasolevat teed laiendatakse 40 jalga, kas see on ehituskava eeltingimus ja kas parlamendil on võimalus arvamust avaldada.<br/><br/>Hr Leveson Gower, kirikukinnisvaravolinik vastas esimesele osale "jah".<br/><br/>Hr Carvell Williams, "Kas ma saan aru, et see on kavatsus hävitada see osa Highgate Woodsist, tuginedes sellele?"<br/><br/>Kaks päeva hiljem avaldas The Star artikli, mis väärib iga kaasaegset tabloidi.<br/><br/>Täht<br/>18. detsember 1893<br/><br/>"Parlament peab valvsalt jälgima neid vandaalid ja vankri ehitaja konföderatsioone, kiriklikke volinikke, kes alati võõrandavad mõne maatüki või eelistavad ehitajaid üldsusele. Volinikud ei müüks Churchyard Bottom puitu maksumaksjatele, kuid teevad nüüd ettepaneku "avada see”, lõikades läbi kaks laia teed seoses ühega nende arvukatest ehituskavadest. Kas keegi ei esita parlamendis küsimust ja ei kontrolli volinike telliskivi- ja mördipoliitikat?”<br/><br/>Selleks ajaks, kui see oli trükitud, oli küsimus esitatud ja vastus oli kas vale või eksitav. Teised paberid võtsid lugu. The Times ütles pikas aruandes, et kommünikeerid ei olnud valmis andma lubadust, et parlamendil või mõnel muul avalik-õiguslikul asutusel peaks olema võimalus kaaluda mis tahes kava puiduobjekti ehitamiseks.<br/><br/>Olukord kestis 18 kuud, kuni kiriklikud volinikud olid sunnitud alustama uurimist, mis algas Highgate'is 31. mail 1895, mida juhatas kirikliku voliniku abi. Uurimine tekitas ajalehekirjade rohkuse, millest see oli kõige olulisem.<br/><br/>Daily Chronicle, 5. juuni 1895<br/><br/>VANDALISM KÕRGAL<br/><br/>Söör...<br/><br/>Kas te aitate meil vältida õnnetust, mis ei oleks mitte ainult lähiümbruses, vaid kogu tihedalt asustatud Põhja-Londonis? Ükski osa suurlinnast ei ole ehitaja olnud aktiivsem kui Crouch End ja Hornsey. Aasta või kaks tagasi ilusad niidud on nüüd majad ja kauplused. Ballast hunnikud on võtnud koha üllas jalad ja kastanid, ja kui meeldiv külad jagavad saatus Stroud Green, Harringay, Finsbury Park, Highbury ja Islington.<br/><br/>---- Eesmärgiks on kahe neljakümne jala tee ehitamine läbi metsa. Selles piirkonnas teame neljakümne jala teede tähendust läbi metsa. See tähendab, et metsad on hukule määratud. Kümme aastat tagasi Lowcreer looduse agitatsiooni salvestatud õde-puu kuuskümmend viis aakrit - London Kruus Pit Woods - ja keegi, kes nägi Bank Holiday rahvahulgad flocking üles Archway Road alates sünge tänavatel Holloway, Islington ja Clerkenwell on alati olnud metsavolinik kuus, ja vaatas innukalt naudingut laste ja pere poolt piknik murul ja puude vahel, E võiks ei mõista tohutu boon ----<br/><br/>--- Kiriklikud volinikud omavad peaaegu kolmandikku suurest Hornsey kihelkonnast. Maksumaksjate raha liberaalsete kulutustega teede avamisele ja piirkonna üldisele arengule on nende vara väärtus tohutult kasvanud ja sellest teenimata kasvust saavad nad igal aastal suuri tulusid. Kindlasti võivad maksumaksjad, kelle raha on sel moel aidanud luua tohutut pärandit, oodata vastutasuks liberaalset kohtlemist.<br/><br/>Sinu sõnakuulelikkus,<br/><br/>Allkirjastanud St James'i kirikuõpetaja, Muswell Hill, Park Chapel'i minister, Crouch End, Onslow Gardensis elav barrister ja kolm ringkonnanõukogu liiget.<br/><br/>See oli lask otse üle kiriklike volinike vibude, nende endi usujuhid ja ringkonnanõukogu, kõik relvastatud, öeldes, et kirik on tegelikult liiga rikas ja peaks olema heategevuslik, mitte ahne. Nende kahe vaimuliku kaasamine oli nutikas samm, kuid pidage meeles, et see oli veel Darwini vaidluste tipus. Darwini usk Kiriku õpetustesse oli jagatud ja paljud inimesed oleksid ainult sellest vaatenurgast Kiriku võimu vastu pahameelt tundnud. Kirik ei olnud nii turvaline, kui ta teeskles.<br/><br/>Õhtune uudis, 7. juuni 1895 ütles:<br/><br/>"Kui kiriklikke komunisionereid kohe ei lahendata, saab hoone kaheksajalg puidust haaret, mida hiljem on väga raske lahti saada, ---. Seetõttu on londonlastel vaja üles tõusta ja teha, kui nad päästaksid ühe oma kõige võluvama maastiku. Avalik uurimine on edasi lükatud järgmise neljapäevani ja enne seda tuleb teha midagi, et veenda volinikke, et Londoni kodanikud ei salli ühe oma lemmikmänguväljaku konfiskeerimist.<br/><br/>Kiri Daily Chronicle järgmisel päeval ütles:<br/><br/>..... See oli suur kergendus, et elanikud, umbes kümme aastat tagasi, kuulsid, et ost Ülempuit oli toimunud; ja kui meeldiv õnnistus see on tõestanud, igaüks, kes külastas neid võib tunnistada, kuid kõik, kes nägid vaeva, et päästa need ülemised metsad, mis asuvad lääne pool Muswell Hill Road, tundsid, et nende võit oli puudulik nii kaua, kui kuuskümmend aakrit ida pool jäi oht. On nii-öelda juhus, et metsad on jagatud laia kõrge teega. Kas keegi kahtleb, milline oleks mõju, kui kirikuaia põhjapuit asendatakse väikeste villade ridadega, millest igaüks saadab oma panuse suitsu ja tahma? Kas keegi kahtleb ka selles, kui suurt mõju avaldaks ostetud metsa maalilisele ümbrusele see, kui rida uusi maju vastu nende lehtriiet üles jookseks?”<br/><br/>See väljendas paljude inimeste arvamusi. Tegelikult ei olnud kruusapuud, mida kirjanik nimetab "ülemiseks puiduks", ostetud, vaid kiriklik komisjon andis piirkonnale, mida nad pidid aastate jooksul ikka ja jälle kordama, kuid enamik inimesi seda ignoreeris. Komisjon ei kavatsenud loobuda teisest puidust, mida iganes keegi ütles, ja jäi selle seisukohaga lõpuni.<br/><br/>H. S. Chamberlain, 5 Cranley Gardens, 8. juuni 1895. aasta kirjas Timesile, kutsus üles ostma.<br/><br/>Ma tean, et see on tavaline, et rääkida karmilt seltskond moodustatud kiriklik volinikud jne, mis oli liberaalne, kuid nagu usaldusisikud fondi nad on kohustatud haldama seda suurima kasu, ja seetõttu, kui midagi on vaja teha, et päästa lammutustööd puu, tundub mulle, et seda saab teha ainult ostes vara Comnusioners avatud ja kes ma tean, on täiesti elus tasuta kaitseks<br/><br/>(See viitab Crouch End Playing Fields, mis oli kindlustatud paar aastat hiljem.)<br/><br/>Muswell Hilli Konservatiivse Ühingu esimehena olen ma elanikega pidevas kontaktis ja võin julgelt kinnitada, et iga naabruskonna elanik teeks kõik, et säilitada.<br/><br/>(Kõik, mida ta isiklikult tahtis, oli heategevuslik sissetulek, et toetada oma vaeseid inimesi. Ta nõudis oma aakri maad - mitte palju kindlasti - ta uskus volinike kinnitust, et puit ei ole ohus.)<br/><br/>"Muswell Hill Road oli üks parimaid Hornsey's ja jääb sama ilusaks, maja või mitte,"<br/><br/>(Ja siis tuli suur retoorika õitseb.)<br/><br/>Kas vaesed peavad kannatama sentimentaalsete vastuväidete ja hüsteerilise hundihüüde pärast, mille teie korrespondentid just tõstatasid? Heategevuslikule maa-alale lisatud aakri suurune maatükk ei muudaks järelejäänud maad oluliselt, samas kui sellest saadav kasum aitaks paljusid vaeseid ja väärilisi inimesi nende kahanevatel aastatel ja võimaldaks meil anda oma järglastele pärandvara, mis oleks kauges tulevikus väga väärtuslik heategevusliku abi andmisel Hornsey kihelkonna väärilistele vaestele.<br/><br/>Tema kirja lugemine tekitab hüsteeriat väga pinna lähedal. Miks ta arvas, et volinikud tahavad ehitada teed? Miks nad peaksid kulutama kogu selle raha, kui mitte majade ehitamiseks? Ta ei paistnud kunagi mõistvat, et aakri maa eest läheb kogu puit kaduma, kuid ta oli probleemiga juba pikka aega tegelenud. Ta oli isik, kellele volinikud olid teinud müügipakkumise 25 000 naela eest enne ja see on tema nimi, mida austatakse Crouch End Clock Toweri tahvlil puidu päästmise eest, kuid tema usaldus kiriklike volinike vastu tundub naiivne. Kurb on see, et juurdluse käigus visati ta välja kui saatan.<br/><br/>Uurimine jätkus<br/><br/>Peatatud avati Highgate'is 15. juunil 1895. Oodates suurt kogunemist, oli nõukogu koda täielikult muudetud. Tavapärased lauad olid eemaldatud ja ruum oli täis toole. Kell pool seitse oli ruum rahvarohke, inimesed võpatasid istmeid.<br/><br/>Volinik Murray ütles, et uurimine oli tõesti lihtne. Hornsey Parochial Charities soovis osta maatüki, mis külgneb nende heategevusliku vara tagaküljel. Küsimus oli selles, kas heategevuskomisjonil, mis kontrollis kõiki heategevusorganisatsioone, oli piisavalt võimu nende peatamiseks. Kiriku volinikud olid valmis müüma maad väga soodsatel tingimustel ja heategevuse tulu suureneks märkimisväärselt.<br/><br/>Selle vastu oli kolm vastuväidet.<br/><br/>Algne usaldus oli mõeldud vaestele suvilate pakkumiseks, kuid usaldusisikud tegid ettepaneku ehitada villasid, mis oleksid vaestele liiga kallid. Siiski oli usaldusisikute võimuses muuta usalduse tingimusi, et nad saaksid ehitada villasid, kui nad arvasid, et vaesed saavad lõpuks kasu. Vaesed inimesed ise võivad olla vastu, kuid neile oli juba lubatud liberaalsed sätted. Kolmas vastuväide puudutas küsimuse esteetilist ja avalikku külge. Ta võttis lugemismaterjalist teadmiseks, et heategevuskomisjon peaks sekkuma, et takistada kiriklikke volinikke kasutamast oma kaalutlusõigust oma varaga tegelemisel.<br/><br/>Uurimine käsitles häid punkte, kuid kõnelejad pöördusid tagasi peamise probleemi juurde, mis on puidu hävitamise vältimine. Islingtoni Vestry sekretär, kes esindab 300 000 inimest, tegi ametliku protesti mis tahes puidu osa kohta, mis on Islingtoni ja Hornsey inimeste jaoks nii väärtuslik, et seda kasutatakse eraotstarbel. Hr Wilfred White ütles, et kui volinikud annaksid neile aega, saaksid nad koguda raha usaldusisikutele hüvitise maksmiseks.<br/><br/>Hr Beaumont ütles, et nad ei taha villasid, nad tahavad suvilaid vaestele inimestele, kes on piirkonnast välja aetud. Teised ütlesid, et ei olnud raha, et ehitada suvilaid, et asendada praegused depalided, kuid villad oleksid majanduslikud ettepanekud. Teised väitsid, et Highgate'is oli mitmeid villasid. Puit oli püha. Pöörduge puidu küsimuse juurde.<br/><br/>Dr Fletcher ütles, et tööliste seas oli hüüd, et pole kuhugi minna. Töötajad tulid tema juurde hüüdma: "Me oleme Highgate'ist välja aetud ja peame minema Highgate New Towni." Kui Muswell Hilli maantee müüakse, ei ole kahtlust, et teed võidakse lõigata otse läbi metsa Hornsey suunas, kuid kui volinikud ei saa maad heategevuskomisjonilt, ei saa nad teed ära lõigata.<br/><br/>Ta oli väga kindel, et suvilad saab panna heas korras remonti. Vaesed inimesed, politsei ja mitmed töölisklassid palusid tal esindada neid kahte punkti, et Highgate'is oli väga vaja suvila majutust ja et kui nad kunagi lubasid maad müüa, ei olnud võimalik öelda, kus ehitaja käsi jääb.<br/><br/>(Valju ja pikk cheer).<br/><br/>Paljud teised inimesed võtsid sõna ja volinik võttis selle kokku, öeldes, et ta võttis arvesse, et valdav arvamus pooldab suvilate säilitamist, kuid koosolekul ei tohiks tema öeldu põhjal mingeid järeldusi teha (Groans).<br/><br/>Teised ütlesid, et heategevuse usaldusisikud olid oma kohustusi täitmata jätnud, lastes suvilad laguneda.<br/><br/>Hr H. R. Williams, usaldusisik, kes oli varem paberile kirjutanud, ütles, et tal on parim autoriteet, et kiriku volinikud ei tee mingeid teid ja et nad ei saa heategevusvolinike tegevusest kübetki kasu. Teised olid palju vähem usaldavad ja kohtumine suleti peaaegu kolme tunni pärast.<br/><br/>"Me seisame silmitsi tõsiasjaga, et Highgates ja Muswell Hillis on hulk inimesi, kes tahavad Churchyard Bottom Woodi ja ei ole õnnelikud enne, kui nad on selle saanud - samas kui keegi ei näi olevat valmis kulutama selle eest raha. Kõik ütlevad, et oleks tore, kui puit oleks avatud ruum, kuid kõik arvavad, et see on kellegi teise kohustus. Islington Vestry on sellel teemal "lahendatud", kuid Islington Vestry ei paku ostu suunas sentigi. Ei ole raskem probleem kogukonna või üksikisiku lahendada, kui kuidas saada valduses teiste inimeste vara maksmata. "<br/><br/>Selle eest maksmine oli tõepoolest probleem, kuna Churchyard Bottom Wood sai intensiivse kohaliku ja riikliku arutelu teemaks. Ühiskomitee moodustati, et koguda raha puidu päästmiseks. 20. novembril 1896. aastal, C.F. Cory-Wright, Hon Treasureer, kirjutas Standardile, sel ajal päevalehele, paludes abi. Ta tuletas kõigile meelde puidu kaotamise ohtu ja ütles, et seda saab päästa ainult selle ostmisega. Kiriku volinikud müüvad £ 25,000 ja ekstra (5,000 oleks vaja tara ja drenaaž, mis kokku £ 30,000. See oli liiga palju Hornsey nõukogu tõsta, kuid nad olid juba hääletanud £ 10,000 suunas kokku. Metsad olid hindamatu väärtusega kogu Põhja-Londoni jaoks, nii et ta kutsus avalikke asutusi ja eraisikuid üles koguma ülejäänud 20 000 naela. Ta hoiatas, et kiriku volinike praegune pakkumine oli avatud ainult 1898. aasta lõpuni. Pärast seda kolivad ehitajad sisse.<br/><br/>Kaebus oli ajakirjanduses soojalt teretulnud. Eraõiguslik eelnõu kiirustati läbi parlamendi ja Highgate Woods Preservation Act, 1897, sai seaduseks. Conunittee nüüd oli õigus reklaamida panuseid puidu ostmiseks ja säilitamiseks.<br/><br/>Üsna lühikese aja jooksul koguti peaaegu kogu raha, kuid viimaste tuhandete kogumine osutus väga raskeks ja volinike tähtaeg oli nädalate kaugusel. Hr Cory-Wright palus lisaaega, kuid talle anti vaid kolm kuud ja siis ainult siis, kui lisaaja eest maksti kogu summalt intressi 4%. Lõpuks tegi Londoni maakonnanõukogu, kes algselt pakkus 2500 naela, selle kuni 5000 naela ja kogusumma saavutati, kuid see oli lähedane asi.<br/><br/>Nõukogu otsustas nimetada puidu ümber "kuninganna metsaks" kuninganna Victoria teemant-juubeli auks ja Hornsey pani peene värvimise näituse, kui Albany hertsoginna ametlikult kuulutas puidu avatuks "avatud avalikuks kasutamiseks igavesti".<br/><br/>Kuigi Churchyard Bottom Woodi päästmise kampaaniat juhtisid ja juhtisid kohalikud inimesed, kes tundsid kirglikult seda konkreetset metsamaad, kutsusid nad abi ja kogemusi suurest inimeste võrgustikust, kellest mõned olid töötanud sarnaste kampaaniatega üle kolmekümne aasta. Komitee esitas kaebuse, mis oli trükitud väga kvaliteetsele paberile ja kandis mõningaid kuulsaid nimesid.<br/><br/>Avatud ruumi ja rahvatervise küsimused olid viktoriaanliku visiooni peamised teemad.<br/><br/>Avatud ruumide liikumine<br/><br/>Octavia Hill, suur eluasemereformer, kes oli alustanud kolme vana majaga Marylebone'is, mille ostis talle Jolm Ruskin, oli kiiresti saanud vaeste inimeste elamise eksperdiks võimalikult tervislikes tingimustes. Tema viis oli osta üürilepinguid ja seejärel lõhkuda mõned rahvarohked majad, et tuua ülejäänud valgust ja õhku, uskudes, et värske õhk ja päikesevalgus on ainus viis, kuidas vaeseid inimesi "putriidi palavikust" päästa. Ta oli õppinud seda lapsepõlves oma vanaisalt Southwood Smithilt, kes arendas oma teooriaid Palaviku haiglas King's Crossis.<br/><br/>Ta oli ehitanud esimesed tööstuslikud eluruumid vaestele inimestele ja oli statistiliselt tõestanud, et hea õhk ja korralik drenaaž päästis elusid. Northwold Roadi Gibsoni aiad on Southwood Smithi ideede otsene tulemus.<br/><br/>Avatud õhu tähtsus<br/><br/>Avatud ruumid ja võimalus hingata puhast õhku olid hädavajalikud inimestele, kes elasid ühes või kahes rahvarohkes toas. Octavia Hill võttis oma süüdistused Lisson Grove'i slummidest üles Fitzjohni avenüüst Hampstead Heath'i. Ta armastas Fitzjohni avenüü väljakuid nii palju, et ta püüdis neid osta avaliku pargina. Need pidid maksma 10 000 naela ja kolme augusti nädala jooksul oli kogutud 8 500 naela. Selleks oli vaja vaid suvepuhkuse lõppu ja mõistvate sõprade naasmist puhkuselt ning täiendavat 1500 naela oleks tõstetud, kuid omanikud võtsid äkki oma pakkumise tagasi. Vaatamata kõigile palvetele olid põllud kaetud suurte majadega.<br/><br/>Sellest kujunes välja kampaania, et päästa parlamendi mägi, järgmine avatud ruum Lisson Grove'ist põhja poole, ostes väljad ehitajate teel, et teha püsiv cordon sanitare edasiliikuvate telliste vastu. Parlament Hill Fields kampaania oli nii edukas, et Hampstead Heath Bill võeti vastu ja seal oli raha üle kaebuse. Sellest raha ja tõuke avatud ruumid, oli arendada National Trust. Octavia Hill oli aastaid olnud huvitatud selliste alade kaitsmisest nagu Church Bottom Wood, nii et ta oli loomulik liitlane võitluses Woodi päästmiseks.<br/><br/>Commons Preservation Society oli tuttav ka sellise agitatsiooni ja raha kogumisega. Nad pidid tara maha kiskuma, kui mõisa isandad olid kinnistanud ühise maatükke, mis viis nii seadusliku kui ka ebaseadusliku võitluseni traditsiooniliselt vaba maa ülbe erastamise vastu. Robert Hunter, nende advokaat aastast 1868, oli alati huvitatud avalikkusele avatud ruumide, suurte ja väikeste, kindlustamisest. Temast, nüüdseks Sir Robert Hunterist, sai Kiriku apellatsiooninõukogu esimees. Esimees Commons Preservation Society oli hr Shaw-Lefevre MP (hiljem lord Eversley), kes mängis suurt rolli selles ja teistes kampaaniates House of Commons. Octavia Hill oli osalenud nende töö umbes 1875.<br/><br/>Samal ajal kampaania Octavia Hill matuseid seaduseelnõu.<br/><br/>Linna kiriklikud õued olid muutunud nii täis ja nii tõsiseks terviseohuks, saastades kaevu, kust inimesed oma joogivee ammutasid, et linna matused ei olnud enam lubatud. Selle asemel loodi linna äärelinnas surnuaiad. Abney pargi kalmistu oli üks neist. Siis oli liikumine, et eemaldada hauakivid vanalinna kalmistute servadesse, taastada laibad mujal ja muuta kalmistud aedadeks ja avatud ruumideks, selle asemel, et neid ehitada. See maa Londoni kesklinnas oli väga väärtuslik ja spekulandid olid innukad selle saamiseks: isegi kveekerid olid ehitanud ühe oma kalmistutest ja ähvardasid seda uuesti Bunhilli väljade ehitamisega. Octavia Hillil oli liitlaste võrgustik tosinas valdkonnas, nii et tema abi kiriku alumiste puude päästmiseks pidi olema hindamatu.<br/><br/>1882. aastal asutatud Metropolitan Gardens Society oli 1890. aastaks kesklinnadesse rajanud umbes kakssada väikest aeda. Hiljem andsid nad need üle kohalikele omavalitsustele, nii et nende toetus kirikuaia põhja puidu apellatsioonile oli algusest peale tagatud.<br/><br/>Kyrle Selts on nüüd unustatud, kuid omal ajal oli suur mõju linnaplaneerimise ja avatud ruumi seadusandlusele. Ühing oli asutatud umbes 1875. aastal "Ilu difusiooni" jaoks, et tuua värvi ja huvi igavas, drabilises keskkonnas elavate inimeste ellu. Eredad värvid seintele ja kaunistustele, hea laulmine, avatud ruumid, loodus, kirjandus ja kunst. Kõik need kuulusid Ühingu pädevusse. Oli dekoratiivne haru, kellele William Morris loenguid pidas; muusikaline haru, et edendada koore ja häid õhtuid inimestele kohalikes koolihoonetes; ja kirjanduse haru. Ühing pöördus regulaarselt The Timesi kirjadega "rikkamatele klassidele" raamatute ja perioodika levitamiseks poiste ja tüdrukute klubidesse, almustesse ja mujale. Kuid avatud ruumide komitee oli kõige aktiivsem. Nimi "Kyrle" pärineb paavsti Rossi mehest, filantroopist, kes andis inimestele oma sünnikoha avaliku pargina. |
| With Thanksgiving around the corner, here are some festive file folder games we made for the girls. Both Thanksgiving games focus on math skills. And I'm grateful once again to my husband, Ed, for making all the clipart for me.<br/><br/>Thanksgiving Pattern Making<br/><br/>Like the name says, this game is about making patterns. Little ones just learning about patterns, can simply match the pictures onto the pattern strips, while others can continue the pattern with the picture cards on the blank strips.<br/><br/>To make the file folder, you want to cut out the grid of pictures to make the card pieces. I recommend laminating them to help them last longer. Then glue the pattern strips down on the file folder.<br/><br/>I wanted to have the blank pattern strips too so that the girls could see where to continue the pattern and how many to lay out. I attached them to the side of the folder using tape so that they could fold in to pack up the game and extend to layout the pattern.<br/><br/>I also added an extra blank one so that the girls could make their own pattern as well.<br/><br/>Turkey Number Game<br/><br/>In this game the girls add the feathers to the turkey body while practicing counting and number recognition. I used the colorless feathers to act as a guide for where to add the feathers and so that the girls could match the numbers. And be sure when gluing down the turkey body you only glue in the center so that the wing pieces can slide under the body.<br/><br/>Once all the feathers are laid out, we practice some simple arithmetic, such as taking away three feathers and seeing how many are left then adding two back to see what it equals.<br/><br/>In addition to black and white wings, we also included a colorless turkey in case you want to have the little ones color their own set. Instead of a file folder game you can turn this into a craft, coloring the pieces, cutting them out, and gluing them together.<br/><br/>Another option is to use the pieces to make a felt board story. We sometimes sing a turkey version of 10 Little Indians:<br/><br/>Like this:<br/><br/>Who Am I?<br/><br/>I think this is where I'm suppose to say something witty about myself. Oh well. I'm a stay-at-home mom to three awesome kids--our twin daughters who are seven now and a two-year-old son who is full of energy. In my pre-children life I was a teacher and I now homeschool our children. I'm also married to Ed, who is currently serving in the Air Force, and is the love of my life (it'd be awkward if he wasn't). Our family is big on books, crafts, and having fun together. I just thought I would share our activities in my own little corner of the internet.<br/><br/>Zoe appears to have it all--rich, handsome husband, easy New York life--but she made mistakes in her past and those mistakes are coming back up in her new life. I found myself on the edge of my seat for most of the book and was surprised...<br/><br/>I loved this book, I love the story, and I am grateful Margot Shetterly brought it to light. My only complaint was that I wished she discussed Katherine Johnson's role in the later missions a bit more but I guess the story had to end som...<br/><br/>I wanted to like this book and I did throughout most of it.

I really enjoyed seei... | Tänupühad on nurga taga, siin on mõned pidulikud failide kausta mängud, mille tegime tüdrukutele. Mõlemad tänupüha mängud keskenduvad matemaatikaoskustele. Ja ma olen veel kord tänulik oma abikaasale Edile, et ta tegi mulle kõik cliparti.<br/><br/>Tänupühade mustri tegemine<br/><br/>Nagu nimigi ütleb, see mäng on umbes tegemise mustrid. Väikesed lihtsalt õppida mustrid, saab lihtsalt sobitada pilte peale muster ribadeks, samas kui teised võivad jätkata muster pildikaardid tühjad ribad.<br/><br/>Faili kausta tegemiseks soovite lõigata piltide võrku, et teha kaarditükke. Soovitan neid lamineerida, et aidata neil kauem vastu pidada. Seejärel liimige muster ribad faili kausta.<br/><br/>Tahtsin ka tühje mustreid, et tüdrukud näeksid, kus mustrit jätkata ja kui palju panna. Kinnitasin need lindi abil kausta küljele, et nad saaksid mängu pakkida ja laiendada mustri paigutust.<br/><br/>Lisasin ka ühe lisatühja, et tüdrukud saaksid ka ise oma mustrit teha.<br/><br/>Türgi number mäng<br/><br/>Selles mängus tüdrukud lisada suled kalkuni keha samas harjutanud lugemine ja numbrite äratundmine. Ma kasutasin värvitu suled tegutseda juhendina, kus lisada suled ja nii, et tüdrukud võiks sobitada numbrid. Ja kindlasti, kui liimite kalkuni keha alla, liimite ainult keskele, nii et tiibade tükid võivad keha all libiseda.<br/><br/>Kui kõik suled on välja pandud, praktiseerime mõnda lihtsat aritmeetikat, näiteks eemaldame kolm sulge ja näeme, kui palju on jäänud, seejärel lisame kaks tagasi, et näha, mis see võrdub.<br/><br/>Lisaks mustadele ja valgetele tiibadele lisasime ka värvitu kalkuni juhuks, kui soovite, et väikesed värviksid oma komplekti. Faili kausta mängu asemel saate selle käsitööks muuta, tükke värvida, neid välja lõigata ja neid kokku liimida.<br/><br/>Teine võimalus on kasutada tükke vildist tahvli loo valmistamiseks. Mõnikord laulame 10i väikeste indiaanlaste kalkunit:<br/><br/>Niimoodi:<br/><br/>Kes ma olen?<br/><br/>Ma arvan, et see on koht, kus ma peaksin enda kohta midagi vaimukat ütlema. Oh, hästi. Ma olen kodune ema kolmele suurepärasele lapsele - meie kaksiktütred, kes on nüüd seitse ja kaheaastane poeg, kes on täis energiat. Minu eellaste elu olin õpetaja ja ma nüüd kodukooli meie lapsed. Ma olen ka abielus Ed, kes praegu teenib õhujõududes, ja on mu elu armastus (see oleks piinlik, kui ta ei olnud). Meie pere on suur raamatuid, käsitöö, ja lõbus koos. Ma lihtsalt arvasin, et jagada meie tegevust minu väike nurgas internet.<br/><br/>Zoe tundub olevat kõik - rikas, ilus abikaasa, lihtne New York elu - kuid ta tegi vigu oma minevikus ja need vead tulevad tagasi oma uues elus. Ma leidsin end serva minu iste enamus raamatu ja olin üllatunud...<br/><br/>Ma armastasin seda raamatut, ma armastan seda lugu, ja ma olen tänulik Margot Shetterly tõi selle päevavalgele. Minu ainus kaebus oli, et ma soovisin, et ta arutas Katherine Johnsoni rolli hilisemates missioonides natuke rohkem, kuid ma arvan, et lugu pidi lõppema som ...<br/><br/>Tahtsin seda raamatut meeldida ja tegin seda kogu enamus sellest.

| Alcohol use by persons under age 21 has been identified as a major public health problem. Studies note that it increases the risks for disability, and may be detrimental to the developing brain. Minors who drink are more likely to commit suicide, break the law, or be victims of violence. Alcohol is implicated in nearly one-third of youth traffic fatalities. The total annual cost of underage drinking is estimated at $62 billion. While most laws intended to prevent underage drinking are passed at the state level, there has been legislative activity and interest at the federal level to support states' efforts to curb the problem. This report describes the extent of underage alcohol use, recent legislative activity on this issue, and various policy implications. It will be updated as new data become available. | Alkoholi tarvitamine alla 21-aastaste inimeste poolt on tuvastatud kui suur rahvatervise probleem. Uuringud märgivad, et see suurendab puude riski ja võib kahjustada arenevat aju. Alaealised, kes joovad, sooritavad tõenäolisemalt enesetapu, rikuvad seadust või on vägivalla ohvrid. Alkohol on seotud peaaegu kolmandiku noorte liiklussurmadega. Alaealiste joomise kogumaksumus on hinnanguliselt 62 miljardit dollarit. Kuigi enamik seadusi, mille eesmärk on vältida alaealiste joomist, võetakse vastu riigi tasandil, on föderaalsel tasandil olnud seadusandlikku tegevust ja huvi toetada riikide jõupingutusi probleemi ohjeldamiseks. Aruandes kirjeldatakse alaealiste alkoholitarbimise ulatust, hiljutist seadusandlikku tegevust selles küsimuses ja erinevaid poliitilisi tagajärgi ning seda ajakohastatakse, kui saadakse uusi andmeid. |
| Tag Archives: real food<br/><br/>Last week I wrote about the Nordic Food Manifesto, and how Denmark created a strong "real food" culture largely from an intentional effort led by Claus Meyer. It wasn't political lobbying or public petitioning that resulted in food reform, but rather a grassroots effort led by citizens with the power to actually implement and follow-through with change.<br/><br/>I ended the post alluding to one question: Why is it so hard for us to do this ourselves, as individuals? If an entire country can implement and spread a common view towards food, why can't we?<br/><br/>There's nothing really stopping us from mimicking Denmark's success. The problem is, we're inundated with so many messages about what we should be eating, and how we should be living, it's hard to know where to start. So rather than following successful frameworks that have been shown to work (like the Nordic Food Manifesto), most people jump from diet craze to diet craze, trying to find the "right way to eat."<br/><br/>But how did Claus Meyer succeed? What was the secret sauce that helped the Manifesto take hold? And is it reasonable to think we can apply those lessons to our own lives?

The unique outer crispiness of the meat gave way to a perfectly juicy interior, resulting in a sound more similar to slicing into a calzone than a ground beef patty.<br/><br/>We were sitting in Copenhagen's oldest pub, which felt more like a casual bistro than a bar, and I was about to try the dish recommended by our waitress/bar tender/proprietor?<br/><br/>"The Paris Beef, it's very good," she had said.

See ei olnud poliitiline lobitöö või avalik petitsioon, mis tõi kaasa toidureformi, vaid pigem rohujuure tasandi jõupingutused, mida juhivad kodanikud, kellel on võim tegelikult ellu viia ja muutustega kaasa aidata.<br/><br/>Ma lõpetasin postituse vihjates ühele küsimusele: miks on meil nii raske seda ise teha, üksikisikutena? Kui kogu riik saab rakendada ja levitada ühist vaadet toidule, miks me ei saa?<br/><br/>Miski ei takista meid Taani edu matkimast. Probleem on selles, et me oleme üle ujutatud sõnumitega sellest, mida me peaksime sööma ja kuidas me peaksime elama, on raske teada, kust alustada. Nii et selle asemel, et järgida edukaid raamistikke, mis on osutunud toimivaks (nagu Põhjamaade toidumanifest), hüppab enamik inimesi dieedi hullusest dieedi hulluks, püüdes leida "õiget söömisviisi".<br/><br/>Aga kuidas Claus Meyer õnnestus? Mis oli salajane kaste, mis aitas Manifestil kinni haarata? Ja kas on mõistlik arvata, et saame neid õppetunde oma elule rakendada?
