| While acknowledging that it's impossible to argue someone into loving something they hate, and vice versa, it's still often enjoyable to attempt the argument. When we talk to people whose opinions directly contradict ours, we're forced to defend our tastes, define our opinions, and analyze why we react the way we do. Which is why we have Why Don't You Like This?, in which two of our staffers will attempt to discover whether people with opposing opinions can get beyond "No, you're wrong!" and have a civil, constructive, and possibly even convincing discussion about their points of contention. Because no matter what talk radio says, there's still a middle ground between "We agree utterly" and "I'm right, and you're stupid and evil."<br/><br/>Scott: Since discussing my Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World apostasy, we've been looking for a case where I can call you out for not liking something wonderful, and we didn't have to look for long. We were sitting right next to each other during Martin Scorsese's Hugo—me, utterly enchanted by its fantastical tribute to the wonders of early silent cinema, and you, apparently resisting it at every turn. Critical consensus has been on my side: It hit the No. 9 spot on our collective Top 15 (though you listed it as your Overrated choice), has won (or placed) in various film-critic awards, and currently enjoys an 83 score on Metacritic. That doesn't mean you're wrong, of course, but the onus is on you to explain why Hugo was, in your words, "hollow and artificial," where many of us saw it as a lovely evocation of Scorsese's childhood and the medium when it was still in its infancy. And please be gentle as you rip this butterfly apart by the wings.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Tasha: I can't be gentle, Scott. Sometimes it hurts less if you rip the Band-Aid off all at once. (And even if it doesn't, who wants to walk around wearing a half-ripped-off Band-Aid? Gross.) The fact is, I found Hugo to be a wearyingly manipulative exercise in fakery, starting from its opening glide through a Paris train station, which reminded me more than anything of Robert Zemeckis' The Polar Express. Unlike Mike D'Angelo, I'm a fan of long, unbroken takes as a way of establishing a space and encouraging viewers to unconsciously hold their breaths as a camera explores an area; but when the space being explored is a slick, shiny CGI creation, and the camera floats weightlessly through it with no physical sense that either the camera or the surroundings are really there, that exploration starts to feel like watching someone else play a videogame. And the rest of the film felt similarly poreless and unreal to me, both in terms of its setting and in terms of its highly contrived, maudlin story.<br/><br/>I don't necessarily have a problem with manufactured, stylized environments in film. I loved Baz Luhrmann's equally sprawling, utterly artificial take on Paris in Moulin Rouge, for instance, but that film has a sense of its own ridiculousness, a sense of humor about how deliberately over-the-top it is. Ditto the stylization of Jean-Pierre Jeunet, particularly in Amélie. (Both Jeunet and Luhrmann felt like strong visual influences here.) I got the sense, however, that Martin Scorsese wanted me to take Hugo entirely seriously. Even though it's yet another achingly sentimental story about a plucky orphan bringing color back into the life of a grumpy old curmudgeon. And I just couldn't.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>There is nothing I enjoy more in film than being surprised. And there's nothing I resent and resist more than being overtly manipulated, being loudly told what to feel and when to feel it. A good film does this kind of thing subtly; a bad one uses crashing music cues and sweet strings—and in this case, a grubby, huge-eyed, disheveled orphan staring woefully at the camera—to demand pathos, and to tell viewers they're horrible people if they don't serve it up on demand. That said, I can deal with sad kids and grumpy adults making life better for each other—I really dug this year's Le Havre, which was essentially the same plot without all the cutesiness—but I find the artificial environments reflect badly on the artificial emotions, and each makes the other seem more fake by turns.<br/><br/>Let's start with that. In our overlooked films video, you and Noel both took Keith to task for championing Tyrannosaur, because you felt it wasn't realistic enough—too contrived, too miserablist, too much, too far. How is it possible that you can't buy a stymied old crank who breaks things when he's angry, but you can buy an orphan living inside a giant train-station clock and embarking upon a whimsical journey to repair a mysterious automaton that he believes might bear secrets from his dead father, but which instead leads him on a quirky voyage of self-discovery, into the magical land of cinema? Did you never find Hugo's gaudy rococo design, aggressive heartstring-plucking, or wheelbarrow-loads of quirk even a little excessive or hard to swallow?<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Scott: Jeunet and Luhrmann as influences on Scorsese?! Forget being indelicate, now you're deliberately poking me with a sharp stick. If you're looking for inspirations for Hugo—indeed, if you're looking for the emotional core of Hugo—you have to go back to Scorsese's childhood on Elizabeth Street in Little Italy, where an asthmatic little boy, unable to play outside with the other kids, retreated to Alexander Korda fantasies like The Thief Of Bagdad. Or, more simply, just go straight to the source himself: George Méliès, whose A Trip To The Moon remains the Big Bang of all cinematic fantasies, that moment when the camera was not used to document the world as it is, but whatever whimsical, magical, transporting place a filmmaker wants to invent for it. And that tradition has been developed and expanded upon for decades before the likes of Jeunet and Luhrmann got their grubby little paws on it.<br/><br/>And speaking of Jeunet, nice attempt to take away my rhetorical weapon, but I'll say it anyway: How can you love Amélie, yet find Hugo synthetic and "excessive" and "wearyingly manipulative"? You say that Amélie and Moulin Rouge have redeeming "sense of [their] own ridiculousness" where Scorsese means us to take Hugo seriously, and I don't think that's the case, at least on the latter point. That Scorsese feels evident passion about the movies is, I suppose, why you'd interpret Hugo as self-serious. But to me, it's those feelings that give the film an emotional ballast that the Luhrmann and Jeunet films don't have. All three films make aggressive use of the marvels of CGI—and Scorsese adds 3D to the mix, to wonderful effect—but where you and I differ is on the issue of weightlessness. I agree that CGI has a distancing effect; worlds composed entirely of digital plasticine are flexible to the point where they sometimes have no presence. You referred to Hugo in your "Overrated" entry for our Best Of Film piece as "a CGI gimcrack"—a perfect dis… for another movie.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>It's fair to say that Scorsese has built Hugo around a standard-issue, "heartstring-plucking" children's book/movie plot: Orphan misses his daddy, creates his own little fantasy world, gloms onto a new friend, convinces a crusty old fuddy-duddy to soften up and maybe adopt him. But that's just the narrative skeleton, and Scorsese provides plenty of flesh and blood. For one, you can't watch Hugo, the lonely boy, peering out from clock towers to the hustle-and-bustle of a Paris train station without thinking of Scorsese, another lonely boy, staring out of his bedroom window on Elizabeth Street. And even if you're not a big enough film nerd to make that connection, I really feel like Hugo's journey is not in finding a new father figure, but in persisting with the mechanical magic that stands as his own father's legacy. That's what film is: The persistence of vision that allows us to accept an illusory version of the world at 24 frames per second is science and magic at once. Hugo's relationship with Méliès isn't about him cozying up to a new daddy, but sharing a common enthusiasm the old man has submerged in bitterness. To me, that's a far more unique angle on a potentially shopworn premise.<br/><br/>Did you really find none of Hugo enchanting? Even the film's few detractors seem willing to admit that the sequences evoking cinema history and Méliès' studio—with Michael Stuhlbarg as the heroic film scholar!—were terrific. It felt, in the best possible way, like a heady compression of my History Of Film 101 class in college, condensing a semester's worth of clips and context into something between a montage and an animated pop-up book. And it speaks to the ingenious design of the film, which layers fact and fantasy so beautifully that it's at once a history of Méliès and the birth of cinema, and just the sort of simple, sumptuously produced cinematic wonder that Scorsese himself would have loved as a child. Thank goodness Hugo doesn't follow the Jeunet/Luhrmann model and have "a sense of its own ridiculousness." As a fantasy connoisseur yourself, wouldn't you say there's value in playing it straight and earnest and unabashed rather than winking at the audience? You may find Hugo sickly sweet, but I don't think the authenticity of its sentiment is to be denied.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Tasha: Yes, I did in fact find parts of Hugo enchanting. (Notice how I'm answering your question up front, whereas you were too busy frothing with apoplexy to address mine, though I assume that's an answer in its own right. Okay, "influence" may be overstating the case—I just meant the visual style looked very familiar. Though as Keith pointed out when you brought this up in person, Scorsese is neither opposed to drawing inspiration from other people's visuals, nor immune to it.) Primarily, I was enchanted by the parts dealing with Georges Méliès' backstory, with his love of cinema, with the work he put into his art and the joy he got out of it. There's an awful lot of beauty and fun in the staging of the underwater-court scene from Méliès' "Fairyland," and in the sequence at the end, focusing on Méliès footage. I'll grant you that Hugo's connection with Méliès over a shared love of film is a nice touch. And I do enjoy a good film about filmmaking.<br/><br/>But Hugo isn't primarily about film, in spite of the Méliès tie-ins. In addition to the themes you cite, it's also about finding your purpose, as the characters expressly, laboriously explain to each other and to us. And it's about spectacle, and big action setpieces, and chases, and happily-ever-after endings where even the angry bully and the shy older couple and fergawdsakes even the cranky dachshund all get paired off with charming love interests by the end. It's about the super-precocious Hermione Granger-type being bossy and perky and clever and praising the magical worlds encased in books. And all of this business is mighty familiar, and mighty artificial.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Yes, Scorsese is playing with archetypes. Problem is, I never felt he imbued them with anything new, fresh, or believable, in spite of his own backstory. I would have much preferred a story about a young Scorsese growing up with asthma—something small-scale and real, without vast rooms full of CGI clockwork and golden glowing dust-motes and prophetic dreams and a raging adult tyrant-guard with a heart of gold—all of that outsized, over-the-top nonsense. You keep citing Scorsese's personal background and love of film as evidence that he's really feeling what he's putting on the screen, but I don't feel his personal touch in any of this, except the moments that are expressly about film. The core emotions may be real, but that doesn't make the execution less false.<br/><br/>You say the authenticity of the emotion isn't to be denied. I don't question whether Scorsese personally felt lonely and isolated as a child, but I don't feel loneliness and isolation on the screen—I see a bunch of exaggerated signifiers (Hugo is filthy and his clothes are worn and all the adults yell at him and he regularly gets chased by a scary dog!) and big beats, with shouting and weeping and Spielbergian wonder-emoting. For me, sincerity is more convincing and more personal when it's quiet and direct; when someone's shouting his opinions at me, I assume he's either really angry, or just trying to overwhelm my senses to keep me from expressing my own opinion. Hugo was one long shout, as far as I was concerned.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Why didn't I get that sense of fakery from Amélie, you ask? Actually, I did. I'll completely acknowledge that Amélie and Moulin Rouge are both big, manipulative, artificial constructions in the exact same vein, demanding specific emotions at specific intervals, and trying to sell those emotions with heavy emoting and aggressive soundtrack prodding. Neither of them really sold me on their emotions as authentic human feeling. What I enjoyed in those two films was the construction—particularly Amélie's heady, laughable lists of random characterizing features and experiences for its cast, and Moulin Rouge's musical-magpie mashups and recontextualizations. I'm often sold on stories that do creative or ambitious things with structure, and both of those movies qualify, where Hugo is a much more linear, standard kid-quest.<br/><br/>But in the end, for me, it really does come down to a feeling that those movies are goofs, whereas Hugo is meant to be taken seriously at every treacly moment. You don't think that's true—but you're simultaneously defending its integrity in terms of its absolutely authentic, rooted-in-Scorsese's-history emotion, and telling me I'm wrong, and he doesn't mean it to be taken seriously. How do you reconcile those two statements? What about the film suggests to you that it isn't meant to be taken at face value? And is it possible this is just another Curious Case Of Benjamin Button-like situation where I find the use of kids in big-budget films to be largely sappy and melodramatic, whereas you as a dad find it bypasses your cynicism and goes straight to your family-feeling?<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Scott: Not sure I meant that Scorsese doesn't mean to be taken seriously; it's just that he's chosen a whimsical vehicle through which to express a serious love of the movies. When you say, "But Hugo isn't primarily about film, in spite of the Méliès tie-ins," I'm mystified. I grant that you find many elements of Hugo overly familiar and laborious and full of Spielbergian wonder-emoting—there's nothing I can do to argue around that perception, which other Hugo doubters share. Sometimes a film means to charm and enchant, and it doesn't for some; you've got Hugo and I've got Amélie, though I think the latter, deliberately artificial as it is, means for us to find it romantic. (Rather than, say, some horrible mechanical contraption fit for a Saw sequel.)<br/><br/>But to say Hugo isn't primarily about film? If it's not about film, then it's the most pointlessly discursive story about [whatever you think it's about] I've ever seen. The relationship between Hugo and Méliès is the heart of the movie, and at the heart of that is not just some stock connection between Plucky Orphan and Crusty Old Guy With A Heart Of Gold, but a shared affinity for engineered magic—specifically the magic of the movies. I think Scorsese and his collaborators have found a way to express their enthusiasm over the early days of cinema through a fantasy that's accessible to all ages. The archetype-filled children's tale is the merely the crust here; cinema is the pie. (Mmmm… pie.)<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>As for The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button, I don't see much of a connection, other than trying to expose me as a Benjamin Button defender as a way of damaging my credibility. (Incidentally, how are the extras on that G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra Blu-ray?) I've said to you that the sleep-deprived new dad in me was perhaps vulnerable to Benjamin Button, but I can't imagine a time when the premise of aging in reverse wouldn't move me. (Cradling the love of your life in your arms as an infant? How can you not be affected by that?) And besides, I don't see how Benjamin Button relates much to Hugo as a film concerning kids, since that's just a small segment of a story that spans a much larger trajectory.<br/><br/>So have I convinced you? Likely not. But I'm happy to learn that Hugo wasn't entirely devoid of enchantments for you. The sequences on Méliès the filmmaker are what put Hugo over for me—and in that, at least, we can share some movie love.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Tasha: Nope, I can't say you've convinced me, any more than I've convinced you. It's impossible to argue anyone into a visceral love of anything, and it really should be equally impossible to talk someone down from visceral love. Mostly, you've let me see Hugo in Scott-O-Vision, which is an interesting experience; at least now I'm mildly convinced that we didn't somehow manage to see entirely different films which both somehow had the same name and director.<br/><br/>We certainly had different experiences, though, and to my mind, focused on different aspects of the production: I still don't see the "film is marvelous" theme as the movie's single strand, so much as one among too many. "Pointlessly discursive" almost covers it, though I'd throw in "often needlessly cutesy and precious" on top of that. While you're focused on the film's tasty pie filling, I feel like that pie was covered with a pound of crystallized sugar, and I think that does make a difference, regardless of the film's core message or handful of terrific scenes. See also Benjamin Button, which I did not bring up just to chafe you—I really do think you have more of a sentimental streak than I do regarding children in cinema, especially when they're used more as symbols of vulnerability and innocence than as human characters. Hey, you know what film totally does not have cute wide-eyed moppets bringing hope to a cynical world? G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra. Maybe I will go watch those Blu-ray extras. I could use some explosion-insulin to compensate for Hugo's sweetness. | Aj keď uznávate, že nie je možné niekoho argumentovať, aby miloval niečo, čo nenávidí, a naopak, je stále často príjemné pokúsiť sa o argument. Keď hovoríme s ľuďmi, ktorých názory sú v priamom rozpore s našimi, sme nútení brániť náš vkus, definovať naše názory a analyzovať, prečo reagujeme tak, ako reagujeme. Dvaja z našich zamestnancov sa pokúsia zistiť, či sa ľudia s opačnými názormi môžu dostať za "Nie, mýlite sa!" a mať občiansku, konštruktívnu a možno dokonca presvedčivú diskusiu o svojich sporných bodoch. Pretože bez ohľadu na to, čo hovorí rádio, stále existuje stredná cesta medzi "Úplne súhlasíme" a "Mám pravdu, a ty si hlúpa a zlá."<br/><br/>Scott: Odkedy sme diskutovali o mojom Scott Pilgrim Vs. Odpadnutí sveta, hľadali sme prípad, kde by som vám mohol zavolať, že sa vám nepáči niečo úžasné, a nemuseli sme dlho hľadať. Sedeli sme hneď vedľa seba počas Hugome Martina Scorseseho, úplne očarený jeho fantastickou poctou zázrakom skorého tichého kina, a vy, zjavne odolať na každom kroku. Kritický konsenzus bol na mojej strane: Narazil na 9. miesto v našej kolektívnej Top 15 (aj keď ste to uviedli ako svoju Preceňovanú voľbu), vyhral (alebo umiestnil) v rôznych filmových kritikoch a v súčasnosti má 83 skóre na Metacritic. To samozrejme neznamená, že sa mýlite, ale je na vás, aby ste vysvetlili, prečo bol Hugo, podľa vašich slov, "dutý a umelý", kde mnohí z nás to videli ako krásnu evokáciu Scorseseho detstva a média, keď bolo ešte v plienkach. A prosím, buďte jemný, keď roztrháte tohto motýľa na kusy krídlami.<br/><br/>Inzercia<br/><br/>Tasha: Nemôžem byť jemná, Scott. Niekedy to bolí menej, ak vytrhnete náplasť naraz. (A aj keď nie, kto chce chodiť na sebe napoly vytrhnutý náplasť? Hnus.) Faktom je, že som zistil, že Hugo je únavne manipulatívne cvičenie v falšovaní, počnúc jeho otvorením cez parížsku železničnú stanicu, čo mi pripomenulo viac ako čokoľvek iné od Roberta Zemeckisa Polar Express. Na rozdiel od Mike D'Angelo, som fanúšikom dlhého, neporušeného berie ako spôsob, ako vytvoriť priestor a povzbudiť divákov, aby nevedome zadržali dych, ako kamera skúma oblasť; ale keď priestor, ktorý je skúmaný, je úhľadná, lesklá tvorba CGI a kamera pláva bez váhania cez to bez fyzického pocitu, že buď kamera alebo okolie sú skutočne tam, že prieskum začne cítiť ako sledovanie niekoho iného hrať videohru. A zvyšok filmu sa mi zdal rovnako pórovitý a nereálny, a to ako z hľadiska jeho prostredia, tak aj z hľadiska jeho vysoko vymysleného príbehu.<br/><br/>Nemám nutne problém s vyrobenými, štylizovanými prostrediami vo filme. Páčil sa mi Baz Luhrmannov rovnako rozľahlý, úplne umelý pohľad na Paríž v Moulin Rouge, napríklad, ale ten film má zmysel pre svoju vlastnú smiešnosť, zmysel pre humor o tom, ako je to úmyselne over-the-top. Ditto stylizácia Jean-Pierre Jeunet, najmä v Amélie. (Obaja Jeunet a Luhrmann cítil, že silné vizuálne vplyvy tu.) Mám však pocit, že Martin Scorsese chcel, aby som brať Huga úplne vážne. Aj keď je to ďalší bolestivo sentimentálny príbeh o odvážnom sirotovi, ktorý prináša farbu späť do života nevrlého starého zmätku.<br/><br/>Inzercia<br/><br/>Vo filme nie je nič, čo by ma bavilo viac, ako byť prekvapený. A nie je nič, čo by som neznášal a odolával viac, ako byť otvorene manipulovaný, byť hlasno povedané, čo cítiť a kedy to cítiť. Dobrý film robí takéto veci jemne; zlý používa padajúce hudobné podnety a sladké struny - a v tomto prípade, špinavý, obrovský oči, neupravený sirota hľadí žalostne na kameru - žiadať patos a povedať divákom, že sú to hrozní ľudia, ak to nepodávajú na požiadanie. To znamená, že sa dokážem vysporiadať so smutnými deťmi a nevrlými dospelými, ktorí si navzájom zlepšujú život - tento rok som naozaj vykopal Le Havre, ktorý bol v podstate rovnaký sprisahanie bez všetkej roztomilosti - ale zistil som, že umelé prostredie zle odráža umelé emócie a každý z nich sa zdá byť falošnejší.<br/><br/>Začnime s tým. V našom prehliadnutom filmovom videu ste s Noelom vzali Keitha za úlohu presadiť Tyrannosaura, pretože ste cítili, že to nie je dosť realistické - príliš vymyslené, príliš miserablist, príliš veľa, príliš ďaleko. Ako je možné, že si nemôžete kúpiť starú kľuku, ktorá rozbíja veci, keď je nahnevaná, ale môžete si kúpiť sirotu žijúcu v obrovských hodinách vlakovej stanice a vydať sa na rozmarnú cestu, aby opravil tajomný automat, o ktorom verí, že by mohol mať tajomstvá od svojho mŕtveho otca, ale ktorý ho namiesto toho vedie na podivnú cestu sebapoznania do magickej krajiny kina? Nenašli ste Hugov křiklavý rokokový dizajn, agresívny srdcový reťazec, alebo koleso plné výstredností, dokonca aj trochu prehnané alebo ťažké prehltnúť?<br/><br/>Inzercia<br/><br/>Scott: Jeunet a Luhrmann ako vplyv na Scorseseho?! Zabudnite na to, že ste nedbanliví, teraz ma zámerne šťucháte ostrou palicou. Ak hľadáte inšpiráciu pre Huga - naozaj, ak hľadáte emocionálne jadro Huga - musíte sa vrátiť do Scorseseho detstva na Elizabeth Street v malom Taliansku, kde sa malý astmatický chlapec, ktorý sa nemohol hrať vonku s ostatnými deťmi, uchýlil k fantáziám Alexandra Kordy ako zlodej Bagdad. Alebo jednoducho, choďte priamo k zdroju: George Mélies, ktorého cesta na Mesiac zostáva veľkým treskom všetkých filmových fantázií, ten okamih, keď kamera nebola použitá na dokumentovanie sveta tak, ako je, ale akékoľvek rozmarné, magické, prepravné miesto, ktoré filmár chce pre to vymyslieť. A táto tradícia sa rozvíjala a rozširovala už desaťročia predtým, ako na ňu Jeunet a Luhrmann dostali svoje špinavé malé labky.<br/><br/>A keď už hovoríme o Jeunetovi, pekný pokus odobrať moju rétorickú zbraň, ale aj tak to poviem: Ako môžete milovať Améliu, a pritom nájsť Huga syntetického a "nadmerne" a "únavne manipulatívneho"? Hovoríte, že Amélie a Moulin Rouge majú vykúpenie "zmyslu [ich] vlastnej smiešnosti", kde Scorsese znamená, aby sme brali Huga vážne, a nemyslím si, že je to tak, aspoň v druhom bode. To, že Scorsese cíti očividnú vášeň pre filmy, je, predpokladám, dôvod, prečo by ste interpretovali Huga ako seba-vážneho. Ale pre mňa sú to tie pocity, ktoré dávajú filmu emocionálnu záťaž, ktorú filmy Luhrmann a Jeunet nemajú. Všetky tri filmy agresívne využívajú zázraky CGI - a Scorsese pridáva 3D do mixu, s nádherným efektom - ale v čom sa líšime, je otázka beztiaže. Súhlasím s tým, že CGI má dištančný účinok; svety zložené výlučne z digitálneho plastelínu sú flexibilné do tej miery, že niekedy nemajú žiadnu prítomnosť. Huga ste vo svojom príspevku "Preceňované" pre náš Best Of Film označili ako "CGI gimcrack" - perfektné dis ... pre iný film.<br/><br/>Inzercia<br/><br/>Je spravodlivé povedať, že Scorsese postavil Huga okolo štandardnej knihy / filmového sprisahania: Orphan chýba svojmu otcovi, vytvára svoj vlastný malý svet fantázie, gloms na nového priateľa, presviedča starú chumáčačku, aby ho zmäkčila a možno ho adoptovala. Ale to je len naratívna kostra a Scorsese poskytuje veľa mäsa a krvi. Po prvé, nemôžete sledovať osamelého chlapca Huga, ktorý sa pozerá z hodinových veží na rušnú parížsku železničnú stanicu bez toho, aby ste mysleli na Scorseseho, ďalšieho osamelého chlapca, ktorý sa pozerá z okna svojej spálne na Elizabeth Street. A aj keď nie ste dosť veľký filmový šprt, aby ste to spojili, naozaj mám pocit, že Hugova cesta nie je v hľadaní novej otcovskej postavy, ale v pretrvávaní s mechanickou mágiou, ktorá stojí za dedičstvom jeho vlastného otca. Pretrvávajúca vízia, ktorá nám umožňuje prijať iluzórnu verziu sveta rýchlosťou 24 snímok za sekundu, je veda a mágia naraz. Hugov vzťah s Méliesom nie je o tom, že sa priatelí s novým otcom, ale zdieľa spoločné nadšenie, ktoré starý muž ponoril do horkosti. Pre mňa je to oveľa unikátnejší uhol na potenciálne nakupovanom premise.<br/><br/>Dokonca aj niekoľko kritikov filmu sa zdá byť ochotných priznať, že sekvencie evokujúce históriu filmu a Méliho štúdio - s Michaelom Stuhlbargom ako hrdinským filmovým učencom! - boli úžasné. Cítil som sa, najlepším možným spôsobom, ako opojná kompresia mojej triedy History Of Film 101 na vysokej škole, kondenzácia semestrálnej hodnoty klipov a kontextu do niečoho medzi montážou a animovanou pop-up knihou. A to hovorí o dômyselnom dizajne filmu, ktorý vrstiev faktu a fantázie tak krásne, že je to zároveň história Mélies a zrod kina, a práve ten druh jednoduchého, prepychovo produkovaného filmového zázraku, ktorý by Scorsese sám miloval ako dieťa. Chvalabohu, Hugo nenasleduje model Jeunet/Luhrmann a má "pocit vlastnej smiešnosti". Ako znalec fantázie, nepovedali by ste, že je lepšie hrať to rovno a vážne a bez hanby, než žmurkať na publikum? Možno zistíte, že Hugo je chorý sladký, ale nemyslím si, že pravosť jeho sentimentu sa má poprieť.<br/><br/>Inzercia<br/><br/>Tasha: Áno, v skutočnosti som našiel časti Huga očarujúce. (Všimnite si, ako odpovedám na vašu otázku dopredu, zatiaľ čo ste boli príliš zaneprázdnení penením s apoplexiou, aby ste oslovili moju, aj keď predpokladám, že to je odpoveď sama o sebe. Dobre, "vplyv" môže preháňať prípad - len som myslel, že vizuálny štýl vyzeral veľmi povedome. Hoci ako Keith zdôraznil, keď ste to vytiahli osobne, Scorsese nie je ani proti tomu, aby čerpal inšpiráciu z vizuálov iných ľudí, ani imúnny voči tomu.) Predovšetkým som bol očarený časťami, ktoré sa zaoberajú príbehom Georgesa Méliho, jeho láskou k filmu, prácou, ktorú vložil do svojho umenia a radosťou, ktorú z neho získal. Je tu strašne veľa krásy a zábavy v inscenácii podvodnej scény z Méliesovej "Fairyland" a v sekvencii na konci, zameranej na Méliho zábery. Uznávam, že Hugovo spojenie s Méliésom kvôli spoločnej láske k filmu je pekným doplnkom. A ja si naozaj užívam dobrý film o filmovaní.<br/><br/>Ale Hugo nie je primárne o filme, napriek Méliho väzbám. Okrem tém, ktoré citujete, je to aj o hľadaní svojho účelu, ako postavy výslovne vysvetľujú navzájom a nám. A je to o podívanom a veľkých akčných kulisách a prenasledovaniach a šťastných koncoch, kde dokonca aj nahnevaný tyran a plachý starší pár a fergawdsakes dokonca aj kľukatý jazvečík sa nakoniec spárujú s očarujúcimi milostnými záujmami. Je to o super-vyspelej Hermione Grangerovej, ktorá je panovačná a energická a múdra a chváli čarovné svety uzavreté v knihách. A všetko toto podnikanie je veľmi známe a veľmi umelé.<br/><br/>Inzercia<br/><br/>Áno, Scorsese sa hrá s archetypy. Problém je, že som nikdy nemal pocit, že ich naplnil niečím novým, čerstvým alebo uveriteľným, napriek jeho vlastnému príbehu. Dal by som prednosť príbehu o mladom Scorsese vyrastajúcom s astmou - niečom malom a skutočnom, bez rozsiahlych miestností plných CGI hodinových ručičiek a zlatých žiariacich prachových motívov a prorockých snov a zúriacej dospelej tyranskej stráže so zlatým srdcom - to všetko prekonané, over-the-top nezmysly. Stále citujete Scorseseho osobné zázemie a lásku k filmu ako dôkaz, že naozaj cíti to, čo dáva na obrazovku, ale ja necítim jeho osobný dotyk v ničom z toho, okrem momentov, ktoré sú výslovne o filme. Základné emócie môžu byť skutočné, ale to neznamená, že poprava je menej nepravdivá.<br/><br/>Hovoríte, že autentickosť emócií sa nedá poprieť. Nepýtam sa, či sa Scorsese osobne cítil osamelý a izolovaný ako dieťa, ale necítim osamelosť a izoláciu na obrazovke - vidím veľa prehnaných signifikátorov (Hugo je špinavý a jeho oblečenie je opotrebované a všetci dospelí na neho kričia a pravidelne ho prenasleduje strašidelný pes!) a veľké údery, s krikom a plačom a Spielbergovský zázrak-emoting. Pre mňa je úprimnosť presvedčivejšia a osobnejšia, keď je tichá a priama; keď na mňa niekto kričí svoje názory, predpokladám, že je buď naozaj nahnevaný, alebo sa len snaží premôcť moje zmysly, aby mi zabránil vyjadriť svoj vlastný názor. Hugo bol jeden dlhý výkrik, pokiaľ ide o mňa.<br/><br/>Inzercia<br/><br/>Prečo som nedostala ten pocit falošnosti od Amélie, pýtate sa? Úplne uznávam, že Amélie a Moulin Rouge sú veľké, manipulatívne, umelé konštrukcie v rovnakom duchu, vyžadujúce špecifické emócie v určitých intervaloch a snažiace sa predávať tieto emócie s ťažkým emotívnym a agresívnym soundtrackom. Ani jeden z nich mi nepredal svoje emócie ako autentický ľudský pocit. To, čo som si v týchto dvoch filmoch užil, bola konštrukcia - najmä Améliin opojný, smiešny zoznam náhodných charakterizačných funkcií a skúseností pre jeho obsadenie a mashups a rekontextualizácie Moulin Rouge. Často som predávaný na príbehy, ktoré robia kreatívne alebo ambiciózne veci so štruktúrou, a oba tieto filmy sa kvalifikujú, kde Hugo je oveľa lineárnejší, štandardný detský dopyt.<br/><br/>Ale nakoniec, pre mňa, to naozaj príde k pocitu, že tie filmy sú hlúpe, zatiaľ čo Hugo je určený byť braný vážne v každom okamihu. Nemyslíte si, že je to pravda - ale zároveň obhajujete jej integritu z hľadiska jej absolútne autentickej, zakorenenej-v-Scorseseho-histórii emócie a hovoríte mi, že sa mýlim a on to nemyslí vážne. Ako zladíte tieto dva výroky? A čo film naznačuje, že nie je určený na to, aby bol prijatý za nominálnu hodnotu? A je možné, že je to len ďalšia situácia podobná Podivuhodnému prípadu Benjamina Buttona, keď považujem používanie detí vo filmoch s veľkým rozpočtom za do značnej miery saptické a melodramatické, zatiaľ čo vy ako otec považujete, že obchádza váš cynizmus a ide priamo k vášmu rodinnému cíteniu?<br/><br/>Inzercia<br/><br/>Scott: Nie som si istý, či som tým myslel, že Scorsese nechce byť braný vážne; je to len to, že si vybral rozmarné vozidlo, prostredníctvom ktorého môže vyjadriť vážnu lásku k filmom. Keď poviete, "Ale Hugo nie je primárne o filme, napriek Méliho kravatám," som zmätený. Uznávam, že nájdete veľa prvkov Huga príliš známych a pracovitých a plných Spielbergovho emotívneho zázraku - nie je nič, čo by som mohol urobiť, aby som argumentoval okolo tohto vnímania, ktoré zdieľajú iní pochybovači Hugo. Niekedy film znamená očariť a očariť, a to nie je pre niektorých; máte Hugo a ja mám Amélie, aj keď si myslím, že to druhé, zámerne umelé, znamená pre nás, aby sme to považovali za romantické. (Skôr ako, povedzme, nejaký strašný mechanický vynález vhodný pre pokračovanie Saw.)<br/><br/>Ale povedať, že Hugo nie je primárne o filme? Ak to nie je o filme, potom je to najzbytočnejší diskurzívny príbeh o tom, čo si myslíte, že som kedy videl. Vzťah medzi Hugom a Méliesom je srdcom filmu a jadrom toho nie je len nejaké skladové spojenie medzi Plucky Orphan a Crusty Old Guy With A Heart Of Gold, ale spoločná afinita k umelej mágii - konkrétne kúzlu filmov. Myslím, že Scorsese a jeho spolupracovníci našli spôsob, ako vyjadriť svoje nadšenie počas prvých dní kinematografie prostredníctvom fantázie, ktorá je prístupná pre všetky vekové kategórie. Detský príbeh naplnený archetypom je tu len kôra; kino je koláč. (Mmmm... koláč.)<br/><br/>Inzercia<br/><br/>Čo sa týka Podivuhodného prípadu Benjamina Buttona, nevidím veľa spojitosti, okrem toho, že sa ma pokúšam vystaviť ako obrancu Benjamina Buttona ako spôsob, ako poškodiť moju dôveryhodnosť. (Mimochodom, ako sú na tom G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra Blu-ray?) Povedala som ti, že môj vyspaný nový otec bol možno zraniteľný voči Benjaminovi Buttonovi, ale neviem si predstaviť čas, keď by ma predpoklad starnutia v opačnom smere nepohol. A okrem toho, nechápem, ako sa Benjamin Button vzťahuje k Hugovi ako k filmu o deťoch, pretože to je len malá časť príbehu, ktorá sa rozprestiera na oveľa väčšej trajektórii.<br/><br/>Takže som vás presvedčil? Pravdepodobne nie. Ale som rád, že som sa dozvedel, že Hugo nebol úplne bez kúziel pre vás. Sekvencie na Méliho filmára sú to, čo pre mňa Hugo - a v tom, že aspoň môžeme zdieľať nejakú filmovú lásku.<br/><br/>Inzercia<br/><br/>Tasha: Nie, nemôžem povedať, že ste ma presvedčil, rovnako ako som presvedčil vás. Je nemožné argumentovať niekoho do viscerálnej lásky k ničomu, a to naozaj by malo byť rovnako nemožné hovoriť niekoho dole z viscerálnej lásky. Väčšinou ste mi dovolili vidieť Huga vo filme Scott-O-Vision, čo je zaujímavá skúsenosť; aspoň teraz som mierne presvedčený, že sa nám nejako nepodarilo vidieť úplne odlišné filmy, ktoré mali nejakým spôsobom rovnaké meno a režiséra.<br/><br/>Určite sme však mali rôzne skúsenosti a podľa môjho názoru sme sa zamerali na rôzne aspekty produkcie: stále nevidím tému "film je úžasný" ako jediný prameň filmu, dokonca ani jeden z príliš mnohých. "Zbytočne diskurzívne" to takmer pokrýva, aj keď by som prihodil "často zbytočne roztomilé a drahé" k tomu. Zatiaľ čo sa zameriavate na chutnú koláčovú náplň filmu, mám pocit, že ten koláč bol pokrytý librou kryštalizovaného cukru a myslím, že to robí rozdiel, bez ohľadu na hlavné posolstvo filmu alebo hrsť úžasných scén. Pozri tiež Benjamina Buttona, ktorý som nevychoval len preto, aby som vás potrestal – naozaj si myslím, že máte viac sentimentálneho pruhu ako ja, pokiaľ ide o deti v kine, najmä keď sa používajú skôr ako symboly zraniteľnosti a nevinnosti ako ako ľudské postavy. Hej, viete, aký film úplne nemá roztomilé široké oči moppets prináša nádej do cynického sveta? G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra. Možno pôjdem sledovať tie Blu-ray doplnky. Mohol by som použiť nejaký výbuch-inzulín na kompenzáciu Hugovej sladkosti. |
| "I hoped my daughter would be free from difficult and troubling times": Mee Mee's story as a refugee Mom<br/><br/>Hope in Times of Crisis: A Mother's Day Story<br/><br/>By Judith Santiago*<br/><br/>Mee Mee heard that the soldiers were coming. She took hold of her son and frantically joined the rest of the villagers who were running toward the Thai-Burmese border, where the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) was located. Her husband was in another village running in the opposite direction, Mee later learned. After the soldiers' pursuit ended, Mee returned home to her small village in Koechi, Burma.<br/><br/>During 1997-2000, Mee and thousands like her lived under the constant threat of violence from Burmese soldiers. Many people would take temporary refuge in the jungle, and return home to their village after soldiers left the area, just to do it all over again days later. About once a week, Mee and others would be on the move to avoid capture, rape, or death by soldiers.<br/><br/>During one incident, Mee's husband ran ahead of his wife to secure food for his family. Her husband was spotted by soldiers and shot. The bullet shattered a portion of his ribcage, leaving him severely wounded and in distress as he journeyed toward the jungle with his family for safety.<br/><br/>For three months, Mee's husband hid and moved the family with an exasperating wound at his side. He received no medical care, except for Mee's tending.<br/><br/>"I was afraid to return to Burma," Mee said through an interpreter. "I feared dying. I cried and cried every day," she continued.<br/><br/>Mee's husband eventually drew enough strength to walk five days toward a small village in Thailand where they learned the location of a hospital and a refugee camp. When Mee and her husband finally arrived at the hospital, he underwent immediate surgery and later recovered.<br/><br/>Symbol of Hope<br/><br/>Life in the jungle for those fleeing Burmese soldiers was indeed terrifying and difficult. Makeshift bamboo tents with only roof and floor coverings became suitable temporary dwellings. Many women including Mee gave birth to children in the jungle. Mee's then six-year-old son assisted in the delivery of his sister named Eh Ku Hser. Her name means love – cold – sweet. "Cold" in Burmese culture means so as to not pass through the fire of life, as heat represents troubled times.<br/><br/>"I hoped my daughter would be free from difficult and troubling times," said Mee. "I did not want her to go through what I had experienced," she continued.<br/><br/>For Mee, the birth of her daughter in the midst of darkness, torment and fear, was a symbol of hope for a new life to come. Hope in times of crisis, the very premise of the United Methodist Committee on Relief's (UMCOR) newly co-branded UMCOR-Prosperity Candle, is also the essence of that which candles shed light upon.<br/><br/>A New Beginning<br/><br/>With the help of UNHCR, hope for a new life did indeed materialize for Mee and her family when they resettled in West Springfield, Massachusetts. There, Mee met Moo Kho Paw, another woman who emigrated from Burma, and who was working at Prosperity Candle in Florence. The organization helps refugee women who have escaped areas of conflict rebuild their lives through the art of candle making. Moo Kho recommended that Mee join the organization, and Mee gladly accepted.<br/><br/>"I was excited to be out of the house," said Mee, "I was raised to believe that because I was a woman, my role was to remain at home and raise my family," she continued. "While many Burmese women want to do more for themselves, they are often encouraged to remain homemakers."<br/><br/>Today, Mee has plans to go into the candle-making business for herself and support her five children, but she expressed the need to learn English first.<br/><br/>"In the Thai refugee camp, we had education, but it was not so good," said Mee. "When I was a child, I wanted to go to school, but I was told to stay home because I was a woman. Now, I have hopes for my daughters to go to college and become doctors or policewomen," continued Mee.<br/><br/>Mee has struck an even balance in her life that she wishes others would have found—a simple, happy life where work, caring for family members and freedom of choice all have their place.<br/><br/>Support Refugee Women in the US<br/><br/>Share this Mother's Day story with your loved ones. And, when you purchase handmade candles by Mee, Moo Kho, and Naw, another Burmese refugee woman working at Prosperity Candle , know you are helping to support their livelihood as they rebuild their lives and those of their family members in the US. | "Dúfal som, že moja dcéra bude oslobodená od ťažkých a znepokojujúcich časov." - Mee Mee<br/><br/>Nádej v časoch krízy: Príbeh dňa matiek<br/><br/>Od užívateľa Judith Santiago<br/><br/>Mee Mee počula, že prichádzajú vojaci. Zúfalo sa pripojila k ostatným dedinčanom, ktorí utekali k thajsko-barmskej hranici, kde sa nachádzal Úrad vysokého komisára OSN pre utečencov (UNHCR). Jej manžel bol v inej dedine beží v opačnom smere, Mee neskôr dozvedel. Po skončení prenasledovanie vojakov, Mee sa vrátil domov do svojej malej dediny v Koechi, Barma.<br/><br/>V rokoch 1997-2000 Mee a jej tisícky žili pod neustálou hrozbou násilia zo strany barmských vojakov. Mnohí ľudia by sa dočasne uchýlili do džungle a vrátili by sa domov do svojej dediny po tom, čo vojaci opustili oblasť, len aby to urobili znova o niekoľko dní neskôr. Asi raz týždenne by Mee a ďalší boli v pohybe, aby sa vyhli zajatiu, znásilneniu alebo smrti vojakov.<br/><br/>Počas jedného incidentu Mee manžel bežal pred svojou ženou, aby zabezpečil jedlo pre svoju rodinu. Jej manžel bol spozorovaný vojakmi a zastrelený. Guľka rozbila časť jeho hrudníka a zanechala ho vážne raneného a v tiesni, keď sa vydal do džungle so svojou rodinou do bezpečia.<br/><br/>Po dobu troch mesiacov, Mee manžel skryl a presťahoval rodinu s podráždenou ranou po jeho boku. Nedostal žiadnu lekársku starostlivosť, s výnimkou Meeovej starostlivosti.<br/><br/>"Bála som sa vrátiť do Barmy," povedala Mee prostredníctvom tlmočníka. "Bála som sa umierania. Plakala som a plakala každý deň," pokračovala.<br/><br/>Mee manžel nakoniec čerpal dostatok sily na to, aby päť dní kráčal smerom k malej dedinke v Thajsku, kde sa dozvedeli polohu nemocnice a utečeneckého tábora. Keď Mee a jej manžel konečne dorazili do nemocnice, podstúpil okamžitú operáciu a neskôr sa zotavil.<br/><br/>Symbol nádeje<br/><br/>Život v džungli pre tých, ktorí utekajú z barmských vojakov, bol naozaj desivý a ťažký. Provizórne bambusové stany s iba strechou a podlahovými krytinami sa stali vhodnými dočasnými obydliami. Mnoho žien vrátane Mee porodila deti v džungli. Mee je potom šesť-ročný syn asistoval pri pôrode svojej sestry s názvom Eh Ku Hser. Jej meno znamená láska - studený - sladký. "Chladný" v barmskej kultúre znamená, aby neprešiel ohňom života, ako teplo predstavuje nepokojné časy.<br/><br/>"Dúfala som, že moja dcéra bude oslobodená od ťažkých a znepokojujúcich časov," povedala Mee. "Nechcela som, aby prešla tým, čo som prežila ja," pokračovala.<br/><br/>Pre Mee bolo narodenie jej dcéry uprostred temnoty, trápenia a strachu symbolom nádeje na nový život. Nádej v časoch krízy, samotný predpoklad UMCOR (United Methodist Committee on Relief) novo-označenej sviečky UMCOR-Prosperity, je tiež podstatou toho, na čo sviečky vrhajú svetlo.<br/><br/>Nový začiatok<br/><br/>S pomocou UNHCR sa nádej na nový život skutočne zhmotnila pre Mee a jej rodinu, keď sa presťahovali do West Springfieldu v Massachusetts. Tam sa Mee stretol s Moo Kho Paw, ďalšou ženou, ktorá emigrovala z Barmy a ktorá pracovala v Prosperity Candle vo Florencii. Organizácia pomáha utečencom ženám, ktoré unikli z oblastí konfliktu, obnoviť svoje životy prostredníctvom umenia výroby sviečok. Moo Kho odporučil, aby sa Mee pripojil k organizácii a Mee s radosťou prijal.<br/><br/>“Bola som nadšená, že som bola mimo domu,” povedala Mee, “bola som vychovaná, aby som verila, že pretože som žena, mojou úlohou bolo zostať doma a zvýšiť svoju rodinu,” pokračovala. "Zatiaľ čo mnohé barmské ženy chcú urobiť viac pre seba, sú často povzbudzované, aby zostali doma."<br/><br/>Dnes Mee plánuje ísť do výroby sviečok pre seba a podporovať svojich päť detí, ale vyjadrila potrebu najprv sa naučiť angličtinu.<br/><br/>"V thajskom utečeneckom tábore sme mali vzdelanie, ale nebolo to také dobré," povedal Mee. "Keď som bol dieťa, chcel som ísť do školy, ale bolo mi povedané, aby som zostal doma, pretože som žena. Teraz dúfam, že moje dcéry pôjdu na vysokú školu a stanú sa lekárkami alebo policajtkami,“ pokračovala Mee.<br/><br/>Mee dosiahla vo svojom živote rovnováhu, ktorú by si želala, aby našli iní - jednoduchý, šťastný život, kde práca, starostlivosť o rodinných príslušníkov a sloboda voľby majú svoje miesto.<br/><br/>Pomoc utečencom v USA<br/><br/>Podeľte sa o tento príbeh so svojimi blízkymi. A keď si kúpite ručne vyrábané sviečky od Mee, Moo Kho a Naw, ďalšej barmskej utečenkyne pracujúcej v spoločnosti Prosperity Candle, viete, že pomáhate podporovať ich živobytie pri obnove ich životov a životov ich rodinných príslušníkov v USA. |
| The Precedency Essay<br/><br/>1562 words - 7 pages<br/><br/>Affirmative action is a government policy that gives opportunities to minorities, women, and any group who has been the victim of discrimination in the past. Affirmative action is the outcome of the 1960's Civil Rights movement, growing out of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 which outlawed discrimination based on race, ethnicity, or gender. It was the 1978 Supreme Court decision, The Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, which allowed for the use of race-based preferences as a means of fostering diversity, allowing affirmative action to be used in admissions policies. It was created with the intention to provide equal opportunities for members of minority groups in education and ...view middle of the document...<br/><br/>However, according to a 2007 report by the Pew Research Center, support for affirmative action among the American public has actually increased substantiallyin recent years, climbing from 58% in 1995 to 70% in 2007. Supporters of affirmative action make many arguments in support of affirmative action, in the hopes of getting others to see the genuine good that affirmative actin policies bring to our society. Supporters believe that affirmative action is more of a process rather than an admissions policy. Colleges and universities take the extra initiative to reach out to minority groups, encouraging them to apply. Colleges and universities offer additional financial aid and provide on-campus resources to help better the student's college education. Supporters also note the rising number of minority applications to colleges and universities due in part to affirmative action policies.<br/>Statistics have proven that when affirmative action is eliminated, such as when it was at Berkley College and UCLA in 1998, the minority student admissions fell 61 percent and 36 percent respectively, proving that affirmative action plays a major role in a minority students college admissions process. Affirmative action supporters also believe that diversity in higher education provides a better educational atmosphere for all students, personally and intellectually. If affirmative action were to be eliminated, there would be fewer minority students enrolled in colleges, causing diversity to be fairly slim. Affirmative action policies are also necessary in order to compensate for centuries of racial, economic, and social oppression. Individuals with a higher socioeconomic status have more opportunities than those of lower socioeconomic backgrounds. Supporters believe that certain racial or ethnic groups are disadvantaged because they are frequently in lower income households and consequently are not exposed to the same resources as students from higher socioeconomic classes. Advocates support the notion of competition between students based on merit, but argue that affirmative action compensates for economic differences. College graduates, who have benefitted from affirmative action, have also said that they received better jobs, earned more money, and overall live better lives because of the fortunate opportunities they received through affirmative action.<br/>Supporters of affirmative action continuously stress the severe importance of affirmative action, considering its contributions to enhancing both the college experience and society in general. However, opponents of affirmative action believe that the time has come to end affirmative action. Opponents believe affirmative action was created to ensure fair admission practices to bring change to a long period of racial discrimination. They believe the policy is outdated."It's time to pull the plug on race-based decision making," says Ward Connerly, a Sacramento, California businessman and lead organizer of...<br/><br/>Find Another Essay On The Precedency<br/><br/>754 words - 4 pages<br/>of the burden to continue prospering.

Potvrdzujúca akcia je výsledkom hnutia za občianske práva v roku 1960, ktoré vyrástlo zo zákona o občianskych právach z roku 1964, ktorý zakázal diskrimináciu na základe rasy, etnickej príslušnosti alebo pohlavia. Bolo to rozhodnutie Najvyššieho súdu z roku 1978, The Regents of the University of California vs. Bakke, ktoré umožnilo použitie preferencií založených na rase ako prostriedku na podporu rozmanitosti, čo umožnilo použitie afirmatívnych opatrení v politikách prijímania. Bola vytvorená s cieľom poskytnúť rovnaké príležitosti pre príslušníkov menšinových skupín vo vzdelávaní a ...zobraziť stred dokumentu ...<br/><br/>Podľa správy Pew Research Center z roku 2007 sa podpora afirmatívnych opatrení medzi americkou verejnosťou v posledných rokoch podstatne zvýšila z 58 % v roku 1995 na 70 % v roku 2007. Podporovatelia afirmatívnych akcií robia veľa argumentov na podporu afirmatívnych akcií v nádeji, že ostatní vidia skutočné dobro, ktoré afirmatívne aktínové politiky prinášajú našej spoločnosti. Podporovatelia sa domnievajú, že afirmatívne opatrenia sú skôr procesom než politikou prijímania. Vysoké školy a univerzity preberajú ďalšiu iniciatívu, aby oslovili menšinové skupiny a povzbudili ich, aby sa prihlásili. Vysoké školy a univerzity ponúkajú dodatočnú finančnú pomoc a poskytujú zdroje na univerzite, aby pomohli lepšie vysokoškolské vzdelanie študenta. Zástancovia tiež poznamenávajú rastúci počet žiadostí o menšiny na vysokých školách a univerzitách čiastočne v dôsledku politík pozitívnych opatrení.<br/>Štatistiky preukázali, že keď je afirmatívna akcia eliminovaná, napríklad keď to bolo na Berkley College a UCLA v roku 1998, menšinové študentské prijatie kleslo o 61 percent a 36 percent, čo dokazuje, že afirmatívna akcia zohráva hlavnú úlohu v procese prijímania na vysokú školu pre menšinových študentov. Podporovatelia pozitívnej akcie tiež veria, že rozmanitosť vo vysokoškolskom vzdelávaní poskytuje lepšiu vzdelávaciu atmosféru pre všetkých študentov, osobne aj intelektuálne. Ak by sa odstránili afirmatívne opatrenia, na vysokých školách by bolo menej menšinových študentov, čo by spôsobilo, že rozmanitosť by bola pomerne malá. Politiky pozitívnych opatrení sú tiež potrebné na kompenzáciu storočia rasového, ekonomického a sociálneho útlaku. Jednotlivci s vyšším sociálno-ekonomickým postavením majú viac príležitostí ako tí s nižším sociálno-ekonomickým pozadím. Podporovatelia sa domnievajú, že určité rasové alebo etnické skupiny sú znevýhodnené, pretože sú často v domácnostiach s nižšími príjmami, a preto nie sú vystavené rovnakým zdrojom ako študenti z vyšších sociálno-ekonomických tried. Obhajcovia podporujú myšlienku konkurencie medzi študentmi na základe zásluh, ale tvrdia, že afirmatívne opatrenia kompenzujú ekonomické rozdiely. Absolventi vysokých škôl, ktorí profitovali z pozitívnych opatrení, tiež uviedli, že získali lepšie pracovné miesta, zarobili viac peňazí a celkovo žijú lepší život kvôli šťastným príležitostiam, ktoré dostali prostredníctvom pozitívnych opatrení.<br/>Zástancovia afirmatívnych opatrení neustále zdôrazňujú závažný význam afirmatívnych opatrení, berúc do úvahy ich prínos k zlepšeniu vysokoškolských skúseností a spoločnosti vo všeobecnosti. Odporcovia afirmatívnych opatrení sa však domnievajú, že nastal čas ukončiť afirmatívne opatrenia. Odporcovia sa domnievajú, že afirmatívne opatrenia boli vytvorené s cieľom zabezpečiť spravodlivé postupy prijímania, aby sa zmenilo dlhé obdobie rasovej diskriminácie.

| Combinations<br/><br/>Combinations Are defenses against a punch, choreographed responses to different types of attacks. They have many names across the martial arts but (in my experience) every art has a version of them. This makes them different than forms because there are plenty of martial arts that have no forms. What makes there partner exercises so universal? Why practice a specific response when (in reality) timing, type of attack, size of the attacker, and a hundred other factors will make it so you never use that entire choreographed response? And finally, how can we practice for a real defense situation and avoid injury at the same time?<br/><br/>The universality of combinations is impressive, to say the least. Our style of Kenpo karate has a list of 108 combos that can be learned. (Most students only learn 20-30 though) In Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu you spend whole classes practicing arm bars and chokes, learning every subtlety to the move while your partner offers little to no resistance. Every boxer has spent hours in front of the bag and/or mirror throwing the same combination of punches until their body moves by reflex alone. Combinations are universal because we have no better way to introduce movement and then practice the subtle positions required to make them work. Hitting a small pressure point through clothing takes A LOT of practice, catching an arm bar with control requires a carefully placed hip and a sneaky setup, and a great combination is only useful if you can through it from a balanced and protected position. Can you think of a better way to gain these skills?<br/><br/>There is any number of factors that determine how you respond to an attack and whether in a sparring match or in a fight, I have NEVER used a full combination in my defense. Why, then, do we spend hours practicing them? We practice these choreographed responses because the objective is not to pull combination 8 out every time you see a hook punch but to show you one way of blocking it and then a possible way to follow it up. I have never chosen to use combination 3 in a reality situation but the block is one of my go-to moves. Combinations add tools to the toolbox they do not fix the car.<br/><br/>The last question is a question of safety. If we practice for the sake of reality we need to replicate reality. How do we prevent injury while doing so? When it comes down to it, it's about building trust. We start slow and learn to trust that we have control over ourselves. We learn to trust our partners have control as well. In more time we learn to trust our control over our partner and (a little scarier) we learn to trust our partner's control over us. In the end (with a lot of practice) you can move are full speed, tossing your partner, and being thrown without fear of injury.<br/><br/>Combinations are universal for a reason; they are practiced so they can be dissected into their parts, and we stay safe by starting slow and building trust. As with everything else in the martial arts, combinations have many reasons behind their practice and execution. | Kombinácie<br/><br/>Kombinácie sú obranou proti úderu, choreografické reakcie na rôzne typy útokov. Majú veľa mien v bojových umeniach, ale (podľa mojich skúseností) každé umenie má ich verziu. To ich odlišuje od foriem, pretože existuje veľa bojových umení, ktoré nemajú žiadne formy. Čo tam robí partnerské cvičenia tak univerzálne? Prečo cvičiť konkrétnu odpoveď, keď (v skutočnosti) načasovanie, typ útoku, veľkosť útočníka a sto ďalších faktorov bude robiť to, aby ste nikdy nepoužívali celú choreografickú odpoveď? A nakoniec, ako môžeme trénovať pre skutočnú obrannú situáciu a zároveň sa vyhnúť zraneniu?<br/><br/>Univerzálnosť kombinácií je prinajmenšom pôsobivá. Náš štýl Kenpo karate má zoznam 108 komb, ktoré sa dajú naučiť. (Väčšina študentov sa však učí len 20-30) V brazílskom Jiu-Jitsu trávite celé triedy cvičením ramenných tyčí a tlmičov, učíte sa každú jemnosť pohybu, zatiaľ čo váš partner ponúka malý až žiadny odpor. Každý boxer strávil hodiny pred taškou a / alebo zrkadlom hádzaním rovnakej kombinácie úderov, kým sa ich telo nepohybuje len reflexom. Kombinácie sú univerzálne, pretože nemáme lepší spôsob, ako zaviesť pohyb a potom praktizovať jemné pozície potrebné na to, aby fungovali. Biť malý tlakový bod cez oblečenie vyžaduje veľa praxe, chytanie ramennej tyče s ovládaním vyžaduje starostlivo umiestnený bok a záludné nastavenie a skvelá kombinácia je užitočná len vtedy, ak ju môžete prejsť z vyváženej a chránenej polohy. Viete si predstaviť lepší spôsob, ako tieto zručnosti získať?<br/><br/>Existuje niekoľko faktorov, ktoré určujú, ako budete reagovať na útok a či v zápase alebo v boji, Nikdy som použil plnú kombináciu v mojej obhajobe. Prečo potom trávime hodiny ich precvičovanie? Cvičíme tieto choreografické odpovede, pretože cieľom nie je vytiahnuť kombináciu 8 zakaždým, keď vidíte hák punč, ale ukázať vám jeden spôsob, ako ho zablokovať a potom možný spôsob, ako ho sledovať. Nikdy som sa nerozhodol použiť kombináciu 3 v realite, ale blok je jedným z mojich pohybov. Kombinácie pridávajú nástroje do súpravy nástrojov, ktoré neopravujú auto.<br/><br/>Posledná otázka je otázka bezpečnosti. Ak praktizujeme kvôli realite, musíme replikovať realitu. Ako zabránime zraneniu? Keď na to príde, je to o budovaní dôvery. Začíname pomaly a učíme sa dôverovať, že máme kontrolu nad sebou. Učíme sa dôverovať, že naši partneri majú tiež kontrolu. Vo väčšom čase sa učíme dôverovať našej kontrole nad naším partnerom a (trochu desivejšie) sa učíme dôverovať kontrole nášho partnera nad nami. Na konci (s množstvom tréningu) sa môžete pohybovať plnou rýchlosťou, hádzať svojho partnera a byť hodený bez strachu zo zranenia.<br/><br/>Kombinácie sú univerzálne z nejakého dôvodu; sú praktizované tak, že môžu byť rozrezané na svoje časti a my zostávame v bezpečí tým, že začíname pomaly a budujeme dôveru. Rovnako ako všetko ostatné v bojových umeniach, kombinácie majú mnoho dôvodov za ich praxou a popravou. |
