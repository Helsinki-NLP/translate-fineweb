| UNDERSTANDING SELF-EXECUTING TREATIES VIA STATE PRACTICE<br/><br/>Updated: Feb 2<br/><br/>Introduction:<br/><br/>Consider this paradox, when a country ratifies a treaty, it is said to have consented to accept the treaty in its entirety (reservations and declarations being exceptions); but in some cases, the countries go ahead and refuse to adhere to its provisions. For example, Article VI, Clause 2 of the American Constitution has the provisions that "all treaties … shall be the supreme Law of the Land." Although it is evident that treaties on their own do not have the same effect as federal laws. In truth, they only become operational once these provisions come into force as Federal law with Senate and Presidential approval. Although this is the practice, it is a generally accepted principle in international law that certain treaties have a binding effect on countries. The treaty must fulfil the requirement of being a self-executing treaty to affect the country without any corresponding domestic legislature directly.<br/><br/>This raises the question as to which treaty will qualify as "self-executing" and which will not?<br/><br/>Whether a treaty is a self-executing treaty or not is decided by national judges on a case-to-case basis (Buergenthal, 1992). In order to understand this, the paper will first look at the two types of theories followed by countries on the nature of treaties applying to domestic law. These two theories are monism and dualism. They basically view the framework of domestic and international law as a single hierarchy and two separate hierarchies, respectively (Wildhaber, 1971). Countries following monism believe that certain treaties immediately are binding and immediately have an effect on the country. Once the treaty has been ratified, it can be invoked in national courts and is considered to be a part of the law of the country. Countries following dualism believe that a treaty does not affect domestic law until it has been reinforced by a legislature passed in the parliament. An example of dualism is how the European Convention on Human Rights became operational in the United Kingdom after passing the Human Rights Act 1998 in their parliament (Laws, 2000).<br/><br/>International law is diverse, and so are the types of procedures different countries follow for the acceptance of treaties. Some constitutions' themselves mention the procedures for the ratification of a treaty. Some countries even have different treatment given to international treaty law and customary international law. Certain international organizations like the European Union often affect the domestic law of its member states. The member states of the European Union have to give effect to certain forms of community legislature. Although, it has an essential difference from self-executing treaties. The difference is that it is not for national judges to decide whether the provisions are self-executing or not, but rather for the European Court of Justice to interpret under its constitutive treaties. Other forms of international law formed via resolutions or such might not have the same effect for these states. Nevertheless, they might consider them as forms of "soft law" and look into them to interpret the intent of the law. Sometimes, proclamations made by the judicial organs of international organizations such as the Inter-American Court of Human Rights affect their member states. Although these proclamations are not binding on the member states, the national judges seem to refer to these for authoritative interpretation.<br/><br/>Therefore, a case-to-case approach must be taken while analyzing the procedures and precedents set in different countries. To examine the concept of self-executing treaties, this paper will compare the precedents set by different jurisdictions. If the reader wishes to conduct a similar analysis, they can do so by looking into the different national yearbooks on international law. Mostly, these yearbooks will have a section devoted to the relationship between international and national law.<br/><br/>International Jurisprudence:<br/><br/>The most significant issue that comes up for national courts is whether the treaty is self-executing? If the treaty can be applied without any additional domestic legislature having passed to reinforce it. This question came up in the case of Czesław S v State Treasury and Minister of the State Treasury, wherein the Polish Constitutional Court held that since the treaty provisions referred to domestic measures to be taken, the treaty was not self-executing in nature (Bug river claims, Czesław S v State Treasury and Minister of the State Treasury, 2003). Essentially, when the treaty refers to domestic measures to be taken, it does not in itself create new obligations. It instead reinforces the treaty's intent for the domestic legal process to take measures for the same. A similar issue was raised in the Sosa case in the United States of America. In this case, the court considered whether the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights was a self-executing treaty. The American Supreme Court has also declared that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is not a self-executing treaty (Court, 2004). The Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland also examined the self-executing nature of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The issue before the court was whether Article 13(2)(b) and (c) were self-executing in nature. The court examined whether the treaty was partially self-executing and did so by checking whether there existed a minimum core content for the treaty to be applicable. The court held that it found no such provision within the treaty (A and B v Government of the Canton of Zurich, 2000).<br/><br/>It is essential to understand that these issues differ from the fundamental question of whether international law can be applied as part of the law of the land? In order to answer this question, the paper will examine the judgement by the Supreme Court of the Dominican Republic. The Supreme Court stated that Article 3 of the Dominican Republic's Constitution made international law binding on the domestic legal order. The court rejected the Superior Land Court's interpretation that these treaties were "foreign legislature" and not part of the domestic legal order. The Supreme Court laid down that all treaties ratified by the Dominican Republic formed a part of Dominican Law and, therefore, can be termed as self-executing (Gallardo Montilla v Gallardo Concepción and ors, 1997). The Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland has examined whether the Libson Treaty was self-executing and directly applicable to Swiss Universities. The court held, "According to relevant case law, a treaty norm is directly applicable if its content is sufficiently precise and clear to form the basis of a decision in a particular case. The norm thus has to be justiciable, i.e. define the rights and obligations of an individual and be directed at the competent authorities" (X v University of Lucerne, 2014). This implies that whether the treaty is directly applicable or not, depends upon on whether the norm is justiciable. The Lisbon Treaty is based on the principle of qualifications acquired aboard. This is conveyed through Article IV (1) of the treaty. The purpose of this was to create an obligation for states to show that their decision-making process is fair, transparent and non-discriminatory. The responsibility for proving that the applicant has not met the required criteria is on the "body undertaking the assessment." The treaty guarantees procedural safeguards, which are generally accepted by countries and hence, the court held this treaty to be self-executing. This goes on to showcase the different interpretations undertaken by the courts of various countries.<br/><br/>It is essential to observe whether the norms set out by treaties are actually being complied with. The case laws from various jurisdictions have emphasized that national courts are the final authority on the issue of whether a treaty is self-executing. There is also an inherent duty cast on countries for the observance and due performance of treaties. Such is cast by the Pacta Sunt Servanda rule as enshrined within Article 26 of the Vienna Convention on Law of Treaties (VCLT). Article 27 goes on to reinforce it by stating that international law obligations cannot be ignored by using domestic law as a justification. Many countries' courts have used this as a source of interpretation, such as the Latvian Constitutional Court. In the case of a national norm conflicting with an international norm, the court held that the national norm was null and void. To reach its conclusion, the court strongly relied on the necessary performance of treaties in good faith as envisaged in Article 26 of the VCLT (Linija v Latvia, 2004).<br/><br/>Conclusion:<br/><br/>From the above, it is clear that treaties have particular requirements before they can be considered self-executing. However, keeping all of these aside, the most important still remains the national courts' interpretation. The national courts decide whether the treaty can be called self-executing or not. Although their Constitution's might contain a provision regarding treaty law being the supreme law of the land, courts from different countries interpret these provisions in different manners. This can be seen as to how the American and Dominican Constitutions' both contain these provisions but follow completely different interpretations of the same. The term "self-executing" may not be congruous for these treaties since, in practice, they still need approval from the national courts. Ideally, the way forward should be that countries acknowledge the self-executing nature of treaties and treat them in a fashion wherein Article 26 and 27 of the VCLT are respected. Again, this is the "ideal" situation and is not likely to find its way into state practice of certain jurisdictions anytime soon. Still, hope can be gained via looking into the interpretations of national courts that respect these norms and hopefully pave the way for other courts to acknowledge this.<br/><br/>References:<br/><br/>Buergenthal, T.

Napríklad článok VI, doložka 2 americkej ústavy obsahuje ustanovenia, že "všetky zmluvy ... budú najvyšším zákonom krajiny." Aj keď je zrejmé, že zmluvy samy o sebe nemajú rovnaký účinok ako federálne zákony. V skutočnosti začnú fungovať až vtedy, keď tieto ustanovenia nadobudnú platnosť ako federálny zákon so schválením Senátu a prezidenta. Aj keď je to prax, v medzinárodnom práve je všeobecne akceptovanou zásadou, že určité zmluvy majú záväzný účinok na krajiny. Zmluva musí spĺňať požiadavku, aby bola samovykonávacou zmluvou, ktorá by mala vplyv na krajinu bez akéhokoľvek zodpovedajúceho vnútroštátneho zákonodarného orgánu priamo.<br/><br/>To vyvoláva otázku, ktorá zmluva sa bude považovať za "samovykonávajúcu" a ktorá nie?<br/><br/>O tom, či je zmluva samovykonávacou zmluvou alebo nie, rozhodujú vnútroštátni sudcovia na individuálnom základe (Buergenthal, 1992). Aby sme to pochopili, článok sa najprv pozrie na dva typy teórií, ktoré nasledujú krajiny o povahe zmlúv, ktoré sa vzťahujú na domáce právo. Tieto dve teórie sú monizmus a dualizmus. V podstate vnímajú rámec domáceho a medzinárodného práva ako jednu hierarchiu a dve samostatné hierarchie (Wildhaber, 1971). Krajiny po monizme veria, že určité zmluvy sú okamžite záväzné a okamžite majú vplyv na krajinu. Akonáhle bola zmluva ratifikovaná, môže byť uplatnená na vnútroštátnych súdoch a považuje sa za súčasť práva krajiny. Krajiny, ktoré nasledujú po dualizme, veria, že zmluva nemá vplyv na domáce právo, kým nebude posilnená zákonodarným zborom v parlamente. Príkladom dualizmu je spôsob, akým sa Európsky dohovor o ľudských právach začal uplatňovať v Spojenom kráľovstve po prijatí zákona o ľudských právach z roku 1998 v ich parlamente (zákony, 2000).<br/><br/>Medzinárodné právo je rôzne, a tak sú typy postupov rôznych krajín nasledovať pre prijatie zmlúv. Niektoré ústavy samy o sebe zmieniť postupy pre ratifikáciu zmluvy. Niektoré krajiny majú dokonca odlišné zaobchádzanie s medzinárodným zmluvným právom a medzinárodným obyčajovým právom. Niektoré medzinárodné organizácie, ako je Európska únia, často ovplyvňujú vnútroštátne právo svojich členských štátov. Členské štáty Európskej únie musia uviesť do platnosti určité formy zákonodarného zboru Spoločenstva, hoci má zásadný rozdiel od samovykonávacích zmlúv. Rozdiel je v tom, že nie je na vnútroštátnych sudcoch, aby rozhodovali o tom, či sa ustanovenia vykonávajú sami, alebo nie, ale skôr na Európskom súdnom dvore, aby ich vykladal v rámci svojich zakladajúcich zmlúv. Iné formy medzinárodného práva vytvorené prostredníctvom rezolúcií alebo takých nemusia mať pre tieto štáty rovnaký účinok. Napriek tomu ich môžu považovať za formy "mäkkého práva" a skúmať ich, aby interpretovali zámer práva. Niekedy vyhlásenia súdnych orgánov medzinárodných organizácií, ako je Medziamerický súd pre ľudské práva, ovplyvňujú ich členské štáty. Hoci tieto vyhlásenia nie sú pre členské štáty záväzné, zdá sa, že vnútroštátni sudcovia sa odvolávajú na ich autoritatívny výklad.<br/><br/>Preto sa musí pri analýze postupov a precedensov stanovených v rôznych krajinách uplatňovať individuálny prístup. Na preskúmanie pojmu samovykonávacích zmlúv sa v tomto dokumente porovnajú precedensy stanovené rôznymi jurisdikciami. Ak si čitateľ želá vykonať podobnú analýzu, môže tak urobiť pri pohľade na rôzne národné ročenky o medzinárodnom práve. Tieto ročenky budú mať väčšinou časť venovanú vzťahu medzi medzinárodným a vnútroštátnym právom.<br/><br/>Medzinárodná právna úprava:<br/><br/>Najvýznamnejšou otázkou, ktorá prichádza pre vnútroštátne súdy, je, či je zmluva samovykonávacia? Ak sa zmluva môže uplatňovať bez toho, aby bol prijatý ďalší vnútroštátny zákonodarný orgán, ktorý by ju posilnil. Táto otázka sa objavila vo veci Czeslaw S/Štátna pokladnica a minister štátnej pokladnice, v ktorej poľský ústavný súd rozhodol, že vzhľadom na to, že ustanovenia zmluvy odkazovali na vnútroštátne opatrenia, ktoré sa majú prijať, zmluva nebola samovykonávacou povahou (Bug river claims, Czeslaw S/Štátna pokladnica a minister štátnej pokladnice, 2003). V podstate, keď zmluva odkazuje na vnútroštátne opatrenia, ktoré sa majú prijať, sama osebe nevytvára nové povinnosti. Namiesto toho posilňuje zámer zmluvy, aby vnútroštátny právny proces prijal rovnaké opatrenia. Podobná otázka bola vznesená v prípade Sosa v Spojených štátoch amerických. V tomto prípade súd skúmal, či Medzinárodný pakt o občianskych a politických právach bol samovykonávacou zmluvou. Najvyšší súd USA tiež vyhlásil, že Medzinárodný pakt o občianskych a politických právach nie je samovykonávacou zmluvou (Súd, 2004). Spolkový najvyšší súd Švajčiarska tiež preskúmal samovykonávaciu povahu Medzinárodného paktu o občianskych a politických právach. Pred súdom sa riešila otázka, či článok 13 ods. 2 písm. b) a c) majú samovykonávaciu povahu. Súd preskúmal, či bola zmluva čiastočne samovykonávacia, a skontroloval, či existuje minimálny základný obsah, aby sa zmluva mohla uplatňovať. Súd rozhodol, že v zmluve nenašiel žiadne takéto ustanovenie (A a B proti vláde kantónu Zurich, 2000).<br/><br/>Je dôležité pochopiť, že tieto otázky sa líšia od základnej otázky, či sa medzinárodné právo môže uplatňovať ako súčasť práva krajiny. Aby bolo možné odpovedať na túto otázku, dokument preskúma rozsudok Najvyššieho súdu Dominikánskej republiky. Najvyšší súd uviedol, že článok 3 ústavy Dominikánskej republiky urobil medzinárodné právo záväzným pre vnútroštátny právny poriadok. Súd zamietol výklad Najvyššieho zemského súdu, že tieto zmluvy sú "zahraničným zákonodarcom" a nie sú súčasťou vnútroštátneho právneho poriadku. Najvyšší súd rozhodol, že všetky zmluvy ratifikované Dominikánskou republikou tvoria súčasť dominikánského práva, a preto ich možno označiť za samovykonávacie (Gallardo Montilla/Gallardo Concepción and ors, 1997). Spolkový najvyšší súd vo Švajčiarsku skúmal, či bola Libsonova zmluva samovykonávacia a priamo uplatniteľná na švajčiarske univerzity. Podľa príslušnej judikatúry je norma zmluvy priamo uplatniteľná, ak je jej obsah dostatočne presný a jasný na to, aby bol základom rozhodnutia v konkrétnom prípade. Norma musí byť teda oprávnená, t. j. musí definovať práva a povinnosti jednotlivca a musí byť nasmerovaná na príslušné orgány“ (X/University of Lucerne, 2014). To znamená, že to, či je zmluva priamo uplatniteľná alebo nie, závisí od toho, či je norma oprávnená. Lisabonská zmluva je založená na zásade kvalifikácie získanej na palube. To sa prenáša prostredníctvom článku IV ods. 1 zmluvy. Cieľom bolo vytvoriť pre štáty povinnosť preukázať, že ich rozhodovací proces je spravodlivý, transparentný a nediskriminačný. Zodpovednosť za preukázanie toho, že žiadateľ nespĺňa požadované kritériá, nesie orgán vykonávajúci posúdenie. Zmluva zaručuje procesné záruky, ktoré sú všeobecne akceptované krajinami, a preto súd považoval túto zmluvu za samovykonávaciu. Toto ďalej ukazuje rôzne výklady, ktoré vykonali súdy rôznych krajín.<br/><br/>V judikatúre rôznych jurisdikcií sa zdôrazňuje, že vnútroštátne súdy sú konečnou autoritou v otázke samovykonávania zmluvy. Za dodržiavanie a riadne plnenie zmlúv je zodpovedná aj povinnosť krajín, ktorá je zakotvená v článku 26 Viedenského dohovoru o zmluvnom práve (VCLT). Článok 27 ho ďalej posilňuje tým, že stanovuje, že záväzky medzinárodného práva nemožno ignorovať použitím vnútroštátneho práva ako odôvodnenia. Súdy mnohých krajín to použili ako zdroj interpretácie, ako je napríklad lotyšský ústavný súd. V prípade vnútroštátnej normy, ktorá je v rozpore s medzinárodnou normou, súd rozhodol, že vnútroštátna norma je neplatná. Na dosiahnutie svojho záveru sa súd dôrazne odvolával na nevyhnutné plnenie zmlúv v dobrej viere, ako sa uvádza v článku 26 VCLT (Linija/Lotyšsko, 2004).<br/><br/>Záver:<br/><br/>Z uvedeného je zrejmé, že zmluvy majú osobitné požiadavky predtým, ako sa môžu považovať za samovykonávacie. Vnútroštátne súdy rozhodujú o tom, či sa zmluva môže nazývať samovykonávacou alebo nie. Hoci ich ústava môže obsahovať ustanovenie o zmluvnom práve ako najvyššom zákone krajiny, súdy z rôznych krajín interpretujú tieto ustanovenia rôznymi spôsobmi. Je možné vidieť, ako obe americké a dominikánskej ústavy obsahujú tieto ustanovenia, ale sledujú úplne odlišné interpretácie toho istého. Pojem "samovykonávanie" nemusí byť v súlade s týmito zmluvami, pretože v praxi stále potrebujú súhlas vnútroštátnych súdov. V ideálnom prípade by sa malo postupovať tak, aby krajiny uznali samovykonávaciu povahu zmlúv a zaobchádzali s nimi spôsobom, pri ktorom sa dodržiavajú články 26 a 27 VCLT. Opäť platí, že toto je "ideálna" situácia a nie je pravdepodobné, že si v dohľadnej dobe nájde cestu do štátnej praxe určitých jurisdikcií. Napriek tomu je možné získať nádej pri pohľade na interpretácie vnútroštátnych súdov, ktoré rešpektujú tieto normy a dúfajme, že vydláždia cestu pre ostatné súdy, aby to uznali.<br/><br/>Referencie:<br/><br/>Buergenthal, T.

| Behind-the-Scenes Tragedies That Affected the Cast of TV's Deadliest Catch<br/><br/>Lowered Fishing Quotas<br/><br/>Even though the crew on Deadliest Catch make the majority of their money from Discovery, that doesn't mean they don't actually sell their haul. So, you could say they have two sources of income, which is something that most people in their line of work don't have.<br/><br/>However, back in 2017, the Alaska Department of Fish and Game started a quota system, which limited the amount of fish any fishing boat could bring back to shore by half. That meant the crew on Deadliest Catch experienced a huge drop in profits for several years. Hey, at least they have Discovery to pay the bills, right? | Tragédie zo zákulisia, ktoré ovplyvnili obsadenie najsmrteľnejšieho úlovku v televízii<br/><br/>Znížené rybolovné kvóty<br/><br/>Aj keď posádka v Deadliest Catch zarába väčšinu svojich peňazí z Discovery, neznamená to, že v skutočnosti nepredávajú svoju zásielku. Dalo by sa povedať, že majú dva zdroje príjmu, čo je niečo, čo väčšina ľudí vo svojej práci nemá.<br/><br/>V roku 2017 však aljašské ministerstvo pre ryby a zver spustilo systém kvót, ktorý obmedzil množstvo rýb, ktoré by akýkoľvek rybársky čln mohol priniesť späť na pobrežie o polovicu. To znamená, že posádka v najsmrteľnejšom úlovku zažila obrovský pokles ziskov za niekoľko rokov. |

| BLOGS<br/><br/>Check out our collection of blogs written by fellow staff members.<br/><br/>INFORMATIONAL BLOGS<br/><br/>Don't Stress It<br/><br/>by<br/>Kristen Hogan<br/>&#124; Nov 12, 2020<br/><br/>Stress, no matter how great things are going, it can always find a way to rear its ugly head. Whether it is a last-minute job request or a paper that you forgot to write and it is due the next day, stress can always find a way into your day if you allow it. Today I will show you a few things you can do to eliminate or prevent stress.<br/><br/>The first thing you can do is to exercise. Exercising is a great way to relieve stress because it lowers the stress hormone in your body known as cortisol. The lower levels of cortisol in your body, the lower your stress level will be. Exercise can also increase your confidence, and when your confidence is up then your stress is usually down. For me, when I get stressed, I always exercise by going to the gym and practice boxing, it helps me burn calories and reduce stress while having fun.<br/><br/>Writing things down has been a way to calm people down for a very long time, and it is the next topic on our list. Writing down what is making you stressed is a way to clear the mind, and it helps get rid of stress as well. I have a similar experience when writing stories, usually if I cannot think of a new idea because of an old one, I will write the old idea down and think on it. That is when new ideas start to spring up and I can continue writing normally. It is the same with stress. Think about a stream it continues to flow down it's path until it hits a beaver dam, and that dam blocks the flow of water and everything starts to build up. The only way to get the water flow back to normal is to remove the dam. This is where writing comes in. When you write it down, you are removing stress piece by piece until you can think normally again.<br/><br/>Stress can come into our lives through doors in our life that we keep open. Procrastination is a way that we can leave the doors open for stress. Waiting until tomorrow may be fun for today, but it will hurt you tomorrow, and is a very short-sighted solution. The longer you wait to do something, the larger that something becomes, and the larger it becomes the more stress you will be inviting into your life. Taking care of something as soon as we receive it is a great way to prevent stress, but it is something that takes great discipline to do. The more you cut Procrastination out of your life, the more stress free you will be. So shut that door, you're letting all the cold air out.<br/><br/>So let's review: Exercise, Write down what is stressing you, and Do not Procrastinate. These are only a few ways to relieve stress but to me, they are the most effective. While I know these may not work for everyone I would like to invite anyone feeling stressed to research how to get rid of it. | BLOGY<br/><br/>Pozrite sa na naše blogy, ktoré napísali kolegovia.<br/><br/>INFORMAČNÉ BLOGY<br/><br/>Nestresujte sa tým<br/><br/>podľa<br/>Kristen Hogan<br/>Apríla 12, 2020<br/><br/>Stres, bez ohľadu na to, ako veľké veci sa deje, môže vždy nájsť spôsob, ako zvýšiť svoju škaredú hlavu. Či už je to žiadosť o zamestnanie na poslednú chvíľu alebo papier, ktorý ste zabudli napísať, a to je potrebné nasledujúci deň, stres môže vždy nájsť cestu do svojho dňa, ak to dovolíte. Dnes vám ukážem niekoľko vecí, ktoré môžete urobiť na odstránenie alebo prevenciu stresu.<br/><br/>Prvá vec, ktorú môžete urobiť, je cvičenie. Cvičenie je skvelý spôsob, ako zmierniť stres, pretože znižuje stresový hormón vo vašom tele známy ako kortizol. Nižšie hladiny kortizolu v tele, tým nižšia bude úroveň stresu. Cvičenie môže tiež zvýšiť vašu dôveru, a keď je vaša dôvera hore, potom váš stres je zvyčajne dole. Pre mňa, keď som v strese, vždy cvičím tým, že chodím do posilňovne a cvičím box, pomáha mi spáliť kalórie a znížiť stres a zároveň sa baviť.<br/><br/>Písanie vecí nadol bol spôsob, ako upokojiť ľudí na veľmi dlhú dobu, a to je ďalšia téma na našom zozname. Písanie to, čo je, aby ste zdôraznili, je spôsob, ako vyčistiť myseľ, a to pomáha zbaviť sa stresu rovnako. Mám podobnú skúsenosť pri písaní príbehov, zvyčajne ak nemôžem myslieť na novú myšlienku kvôli starej, napíšem starú myšlienku a premýšľam o nej. To je, keď sa začnú objavovať nové nápady a môžem pokračovať v písaní normálne. Rovnaké je to so stresom. Premýšľajte o potoku, ktorý pokračuje po ceste, kým nenarazí na bobrovú priehradu, a že priehrada blokuje tok vody a všetko sa začne budovať. Jediný spôsob, ako dostať prietok vody späť do normálu, je odstrániť priehradu. To je miesto, kde písanie prichádza. Keď si to napíšete, odstraňujete stres kúsok po kúsku, kým nebudete môcť znova normálne premýšľať.<br/><br/>Stres môže prísť do našich životov cez dvere v našom živote, ktoré udržiavame otvorené. Otáľanie je spôsob, ako môžeme nechať dvere otvorené pre stres. Čakanie na zajtrajšok môže byť pre dnešok zábavné, ale zajtra vám to ublíži a je to veľmi krátkozraké riešenie. Čím dlhšie budete čakať, aby ste niečo urobili, tým väčšie sa niečo stane, a tým väčší sa stáva väčším stresom, ktorý budete pozývať do svojho života. Starostlivosť o niečo, akonáhle ju dostaneme, je skvelý spôsob, ako zabrániť stresu, ale je to niečo, čo si vyžaduje veľkú disciplínu. Čím viac odrežete prokrastináciu zo svojho života, tým viac budete bez stresu. Takže zavri tie dvere a vypustíš všetok ten studený vzduch.<br/><br/>Takže poďme preskúmať: Cvičenie, Zapíšte si, čo vás stresuje, a neprokrastinujte. Toto je len niekoľko spôsobov, ako zmierniť stres, ale pre mňa sú najúčinnejšie. Aj keď viem, že to nemusí fungovať pre každého, chcel by som pozvať každého, kto sa cíti stresovaný, aby preskúmal, ako sa ho zbaviť. |
