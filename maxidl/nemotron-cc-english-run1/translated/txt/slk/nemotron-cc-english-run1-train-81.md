| Forty-nine years ago today, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act of 1965.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Nearly a century ago, the 15th Amendment to the Constitution stated, "The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of race, color or previous condition of servitude." And nearly a century before that, our nation's founding fathers set in motion the great experiment of American democracy by declaring that "all men are created equal."<br/><br/>The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was a belated acknowledgment that even in America, our foundational ideals carry little weight if not protected by the rule of law. That's why Section 2 of the 15th Amendment granted Congress the "power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation."<br/><br/>And indeed, the codified language of the Voting Rights Act was able to achieve what the Reconstruction-era Congress and Thomas Jefferson could not. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act—and the civil rights movement from which they emerged—served as the catalyst for a dramatic increase in the opportunity for black Americans to participate in the democratic process.<br/><br/>For example, only 6.7 percent of eligible black Mississippians were registered to vote as of 1962; by 1969 that figure had reached 66.5 percent. Today, Mississippi has more black elected officials than any other state.<br/><br/>The protections put in place by the Voting Rights Act were long overdue when they were passed, representative of the arduous struggle with which they were achieved. But unthinkably, these protections are now under assault, jeopardizing the progress our nation worked so hard to achieve.<br/><br/>Last year, in the case of Shelby County v. Holder, the U.S. Supreme Court gutted a key component of the Voting Rights Act that enabled prior federal review to ensure nondiscrimination before any new voting law went into effect.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Sadly, the response of Republican leaders has been to do nothing. Sen. Ted Cruz and Gov. Rick Perry went out of their way to praise the Supreme Court's decision. Sen. Rand Paul dismissed the continued necessity of the Voting Rights Act by noting, "We have an African-American president."<br/><br/>While the election of President Barack Obama was indeed a historic milestone, it is dangerous to think that it absolves us from remaining vigilant against the lingering consequences of our nation's past. The haste with which states have moved to enact voting restrictions is confirmation that the protections put in place by Section 4 are still necessary.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Republican governors have signed strict photo-identification restrictions into law as the solution to a virtually nonexistent problem of voter impersonation, disproportionately hurting women, young people, working families and the African-American community. It's disingenuous for Republicans like Paul to seek the votes of these communities when they believe "there's nothing wrong with" putting restrictions in place that make it harder for these constituencies to vote.<br/><br/>Republicans have also sought to restrict early-voting periods, including the Sunday before Election Day, when African-American churches have had great success with Souls to the Polls programs.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>These restrictions represent a callous effort by Republicans to make voting harder, based on narrow, short-term political calculations that Republicans can win elections by shrinking the size of the electorate.<br/><br/>Democrats have a very different mission when it comes to voting: to ensure that every eligible voter can register, that every registered voter can vote and that every vote is accurately counted.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>The Democratic National Committee's Voter Expansion Project reflects our belief that greater voter participation strengthens our nation and our democracy. We'll continue to use our unmatched institutional knowledge to protect voting rights against legislation and tactics that would attempt to suppress the vote. And because the best defense is a good offense, we're also working to expand the vote by deploying our technology and data resources to register new voters.<br/><br/>On this anniversary, one of the best ways we can honor those who struggled—and in some cases gave their very lives—for the legislation's passage is for Republicans in Congress to join Democrats in passing the Voting Rights Amendment Act to restore the promise of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Democrat, represents Florida's 23rd Congressional District in the United States Congress. Since 2011, she has served as chair of the Democratic National Committee. Follow her on Twitter.<br/><br/>The Root aims to foster and advance conversations about issues relevant to the black Diaspora by presenting a variety of opinions from all perspectives, whether or not those opinions are shared by our editorial staff. | Pred štyridsiatimi deviatimi rokmi prezident Lyndon B. Johnson podpísal zákon o hlasovacích právach z roku 1965.<br/><br/>Inzercia<br/><br/>Takmer pred storočím, 15. dodatok k ústave uviedol: "Právo občanov Spojených štátov voliť nesmie byť odopreté alebo skrátené Spojenými štátmi alebo akýmkoľvek štátom z dôvodu rasy, farby alebo predchádzajúcich podmienok otroctva." A takmer storočie pred tým, otcovia zakladatelia nášho národa uviedli do pohybu veľký experiment americkej demokracie vyhlásením, že "všetci ľudia sú stvorení rovní."<br/><br/>Zákon o volebných právach z roku 1965 bol oneskoreným uznaním toho, že aj v Amerike majú naše základné ideály malú váhu, ak nie sú chránené právnym štátom. To je dôvod, prečo sekcia 2 15. dodatku udelila Kongresu "právo presadiť tento článok príslušnou legislatívou."<br/><br/>A skutočne, kodifikovaný jazyk Zákona o hlasovacích právach dokázal dosiahnuť to, čo Kongres z obdobia rekonštrukcie a Thomas Jefferson nedokázali. Zákon o občianskych právach z roku 1964 a zákon o hlasovacích právach – a hnutie za občianske práva, z ktorých vyšli – slúžili ako katalyzátor dramatického zvýšenia príležitosti pre čiernych Američanov zúčastniť sa na demokratickom procese.<br/><br/>Napríklad, len 6,7 percenta oprávnených čiernych Mississippians boli registrované na hlasovanie od roku 1962; do roku 1969 toto číslo dosiahlo 66,5 percenta. Dnes, Mississippi má viac čiernych volených úradníkov, než akýkoľvek iný štát.<br/><br/>Ochrany zavedené zákonom o hlasovacích právach boli dlho omeškané, keď boli schválené, čo bolo predstaviteľom náročného boja, s ktorým boli dosiahnuté. Ale je nemysliteľné, že tieto ochrany sú teraz napadnuté, čo ohrozuje pokrok, ktorý náš národ tak ťažko dosiahol.<br/><br/>V minulom roku, v prípade Shelby County verzus Holder, Najvyšší súd USA vykuchal kľúčovú zložku zákona o hlasovacích právach, ktorá umožnila predchádzajúce federálne preskúmanie, aby sa zabezpečila nediskriminácia pred tým, ako nadobudne účinnosť akýkoľvek nový hlasovací zákon.<br/><br/>Inzercia<br/><br/>Bohužiaľ, odpoveďou republikánskych lídrov bolo nerobiť nič. Senátor Ted Cruz a guvernér Rick Perry vyšli z cesty, aby chválili rozhodnutie Najvyššieho súdu. Senátor Rand Paul odmietol pokračujúcu potrebu zákona o hlasovacích právach tým, že poznamenal: "Máme afroamerického prezidenta."<br/><br/>Hoci zvolenie prezidenta Baracka Obamu bolo skutočne historickým míľnikom, je nebezpečné myslieť si, že nás oslobodzuje od toho, aby sme zostali ostražití voči pretrvávajúcim dôsledkom našej národnej minulosti. Ponáhľanie, s ktorým štáty prijali obmedzenia hlasovania, je potvrdením, že ochrana zavedená oddielom 4 je stále potrebná.<br/><br/>Inzercia<br/><br/>Republikánski guvernéri podpísali prísne obmedzenia týkajúce sa identifikácie fotografií ako riešenie prakticky neexistujúceho problému zosobnenia voličov, neprimerane ubližujúceho ženám, mladým ľuďom, pracujúcim rodinám a afroamerickej komunite. Je neúprimné, aby republikáni ako Paul hľadali hlasy týchto komunít, keď veria, že "nie je nič zlé na" zavedení obmedzení, ktoré týmto voličom sťažujú hlasovanie.<br/><br/>Republikáni sa tiež snažili obmedziť skoré volebné obdobia, vrátane nedele pred voľbami, keď afroamerické cirkvi mali veľký úspech s programami Souls to the Poll.<br/><br/>Inzercia<br/><br/>Tieto obmedzenia predstavujú bezcitnú snahu republikánov sťažiť hlasovanie na základe úzkych krátkodobých politických výpočtov, že republikáni môžu vyhrať voľby zmenšením veľkosti voličov.<br/><br/>Demokrati majú veľmi odlišné poslanie, pokiaľ ide o hlasovanie: zabezpečiť, aby sa každý oprávnený volič mohol zaregistrovať, aby každý registrovaný volič mohol hlasovať a aby každý hlas bol presne spočítaný.<br/><br/>Inzercia<br/><br/>Projekt rozšírenia voličov Demokratického národného výboru odráža naše presvedčenie, že väčšia účasť voličov posilňuje náš národ a našu demokraciu. Budeme naďalej používať naše bezkonkurenčné inštitucionálne znalosti na ochranu hlasovacích práv proti legislatíve a taktike, ktoré by sa pokúsili potlačiť hlasovanie. A pretože najlepšou obranou je dobrý útok, pracujeme aj na rozšírení hlasovania o našich technológiách a dátových zdrojoch na registráciu nových voličov.<br/><br/>Pri príležitosti tohto výročia je jedným z najlepších spôsobov, ako môžeme uctiť tých, ktorí bojovali - a v niektorých prípadoch položili svoje životy - za to, že legislatíva je pre republikánov v Kongrese, aby sa pripojili k demokratom pri prijímaní zákona o zmene hlasovacích práv, aby sa obnovil sľub zákona o hlasovacích právach z roku 1965.<br/><br/>Inzercia<br/><br/>Debbie Wasserman Schultzová, demokratka, zastupuje 23. floridský kongresový obvod v Kongrese Spojených štátov.

| Q&A: Vatican safeguarding expert Fr Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>13 June 2021<br/><br/>Fr Hans Zollner SJ. Image: Australian Jesuits.<br/><br/>The President of the Centre for Child Protection at the Gregorian University in Rome, and a member of the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors, Fr Hans Zollner SJ, was in Australia in 2018 to speak to Catholic ministry leaders and survivors.<br/><br/>Michael McVeigh from Jesuit Communications sat down with him during the visit to explore how the Church is responding to the abuse crisis internationally, and what can be learned from our experiences in Australia.<br/><br/>MM: This is your third trip to Australia. You've visited quite a few other countries to see how the Church is responding to abuse around the world. Can you give us some idea of what the global picture looks like?<br/><br/>Fr Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>HZ: My understanding, after having visited about 50 countries on five or six continents, is that the Church is really starting to move over the last couple of years on the issue of doing justice to victims, of listening to them, and doing whatever can be done in terms of safeguarding.<br/><br/>I was with the Jesuit Provincials from all over Africa at the end of April, and the President of the Jesuit Assistancy of Africa and Madagascar is very much committed and dedicated to this. He has put up a thorough action plan for formation and for introducing guidelines all over the place. It's a very considerate and very deliberate effort to do whatever can be done to be proactively engaged as Jesuits in Africa — in a continent where until a few years ago all of this was a foreign language.<br/><br/>One of the challenges of trying to develop this global approach is that you're dealing with so many cultures, and so many different understandings. How do you bring this together and try to provide training and support religious communities tackling these issues?<br/><br/>This is one of the major questions we have. I think what I can do is stimulate discussion, stimulate reflection, and prepare people as much as possible so that they can do the groundwork.<br/><br/>The Centre for Child Protection at the Gregorian University does not pretend to have the response to every question. Not only because we don't know the specific contexts — we might know a few of them, but we're talking about thousands of cultures, we're talking about hundreds of languages, we're talking about very diverse legal backgrounds. It varies even sometimes within one country, such as Australia where you have states within the Commonwealth of Australia that have different laws than other states.<br/><br/>I am somebody who tries to elicit and stimulate discussion and reflection. I'm also very happy to listen to people.<br/><br/>You mentioned the need to listen and support victims in being heard. We've obviously had the Royal Commission here in Australia, but what are some of the other ways that you've seen that the voices of victims are being supported around the world?<br/><br/>In France there is one diocese that has established what they call 'The Listening Space'. There, victims can come forward and they can express themselves. The bishop is present. It's an open space in which people who have been hurt tremendously are free at least to express what they want to ask from the Church leadership etc.<br/><br/>There are other places in the USA or in other countries where victims have been invited by dioceses, by Provinces, by the leadership of the Church, to come forward. I have to say that overall I think there is a good will, and there are more people like bishops and provincials who listen to victims than we know. But there is no one model of giving victims not only the space to express themselves and be listened to, but also to engage actively in Church development.<br/><br/>In terms of setting up spaces for support for victims, what are some of the things you've seen that could really help — and that we could be considering here in Australia?<br/><br/>One of the major points that many victims bring up is, 'Can't we have, within parish settings, within schools settings, a regular conversation going on that includes survivors of abuse as regular members of a committee, a commission, a sounding board, a feedback group or something like that?' So that this voice is not only brought in on a specific occasion, or where a person feels like he or she is at a point to be able to speak out about it, but [is heard] on a regular basis — build that voice into the system.<br/><br/>That will help all of us. It will help survivors and victims because they will feel welcome and appreciated in the specific experience, and in the specific life challenges, that they went through. Secondly it will help the community at large, because we can at least make ourselves more and more sensitive to what the concerns and specific needs of survivors are — that can also talk to the needs of young people.<br/><br/>M: We have strong groups of survivors here in Australia who have been able to support each other through that process. But what you're saying is that we need some way of supporting those groups, and supporting those people, through our own institutions as well?<br/><br/>And I think we need to be creative. It will work for one school and one parish and one diocese in one way, and for others in a different way. Because the survivors with whom I am in constant contact, they have quite similar requests, and similar experiences in regard to being welcomed in the Church or not — feeling thrown out or dismissed. But they have also among themselves quite different expectations. So I have learned that you have also to be very forthcoming in accepting the differences in what this specific group, or this specific survivor, wants, requests and needs.<br/><br/>M: Survivors talk about wanting to have their stories heard and acknowledged. We've had the Royal Commission here in Australia, which provided an independent process where victims could come forward. Is there a need for something like that in terms of a truth, justice and reconciliation process for the Church internationally?<br/><br/>H: Yes, I think there is a need for that internationally. But I think first every local church needs to do its own homework. I don't see it happening very soon that some such council or commission would be established to look into this area for the whole Church. The Church has a membership of 1.3 billion people, and is present in 190 countries, with all kinds of differences in expectations concerning psychological, spiritual and financial support.<br/><br/>There is one thing that I have come across consistently in communicating with, working with and listening to victims, and that is that they want to be listened to. So if there was the feeling that victims were constantly being listened to — in Rome and elsewhere — I think that would give a great relief to many victims.<br/><br/>I think [Pope Francis'] concern, especially with regard to your question, is that the local churches do whatever they can so that victims will be listened to in that particular country. I have a list of people who want to speak to the Holy Father directly, and physically it is impossible. I was there in 2014 to translate for two German survivors who were chosen with two Irish and two English survivors when he received the six of them at home. He took the whole morning listening to them one after the other. For each one, he was there for 40 to 45 minutes. Were he to do this for every survivor he couldn't sleep anymore.<br/><br/>His example is modelling for the whole Catholic Church the way victims and survivors are received, welcomed and listened to. I think if the bishops and the provincials in this world, in all countries, followed his example, many survivors would be really appreciative of that.<br/><br/>Archbishop Diarmud Martin was recently quoted just before the World Meeting of Families, about the Pontifical Commission, saying that it's too small as it's currently set up to achieve what it needs to achieve. What's your take on that? Does the Church need to be putting more resources into how it's overseeing those issues?<br/><br/>At the moment we are 16 members from basically all continents, and the major language groups. We represent a variety of disciplines and professions, and the purpose of the commission — as the statutes that have just been promulgated state — is to provide counsel to the Holy Father.<br/><br/>A common misunderstanding about the commission is first that we deal with cases of allegations. That is not the case. We have no juridical or administrative power in regards to cases, because when it comes to allegations of abuse the tribunals and procedure are set.<br/><br/>A second misunderstanding is that we promote, directly, things on the ground. Our first and foremost goal is that we advise the Holy Father on issues.<br/><br/>So from my point of view, yes, we need to invest more. But we need to invest more on the local level, and we need to make sure that the proposals from the Pontifical Commission are forwarded to the Holy Father — which normally the President does — and then there is a follow-up process that reflects what we have given as our advice.<br/><br/>In Australia, Catholic Professional Standards Limited is overseeing the Church's response and providing guidelines and support for ensuring all the institutions in the Church are child-safe institutions. Is there a need for some kind of organisational support from Rome for those bishops and dioceses that are struggling to form these institutions and provide safeguarding in those dioceses?<br/><br/>I think ultimately the commission will develop in that line. They are now in the process of hiring experts in those areas.<br/><br/>I think the Church needs to understand that the local churches can learn from each other mutually. And my understanding has always been — and I think the Holy Father has reminded us — that the Church will not function as a centralised company. It does not work like that, effectively. Every bishop, every bishops conference, has, to some extent, its life on its own. What we need to learn more is to open channels of mutual communication.<br/><br/>There are a number of things that people blame for abuse in the Church. As a priest and a psychologist, and as someone who has met and worked with survivors, what are your thoughts on that issue?<br/><br/>I think the question of where does abuse come from is the most important one, and the Pope has addressed that in his letter to the people of God published on 20 August. He says in the first paragraph, and repeats it over and over again, that the question of sexual abuse is always linked — or almost always linked — not only to the question of abuse of power, but also to the abuse of conscience.<br/><br/>So the real fundamental question of abuse is much more complex than just [the question of] sexuality — be it heterosexual or homosexual. It's a power issue, and there we have to really work on the question of how do we understand priesthood, how to we understand bishophood, how do we understand and live out our ministries? What are the boundaries?<br/><br/>That's why I'm very happy that the Jesuit Province in Australia is establishing a Code of Conduct. Because we don't talk only about sexual abuse of minors. We talk about sexual abuse of adults, and we talk about abuse in other ways — like abuse of conscience, where you dictate to someone what you think, or you pretend to know by God, and you can tell another person, 'You need to do that', against the conscience of that person.<br/><br/>Many people think celibacy produces abuse. As I always say, celibacy as such is not cause for abusing — otherwise how do we explain that 99.9 per cent of all abusers do not live a celibate life, and how do we explain that 95 or 96 per cent of all priests do not abuse minors? But, celibacy, or a vow of chastity, that is not really integrated, that is not really lived out properly — yes, that produces a problem. Sometimes people take to drinking, sometime they take to gambling, and sometimes they take to sexual misconduct, with adults and with minors.<br/><br/>The real question about this is how do we deal with the notion of religious spiritual power with which priests and bishops are invested? How can theology help us to understand, and maybe how can sociology, psychology, or business administration help us to define the limits of power, and the necessity of keeping your boundaries | Otázky a odpovede: Vatikánsky odborník na ochranu Fr Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>13. júna 2021<br/><br/>Hans Zollner SJ. Obrázok: Austrálski jezuiti.<br/><br/>Predseda Centra pre ochranu detí na Gregoriánskej univerzite v Ríme a člen Pápežskej komisie pre ochranu maloletých, Hans Zollner SJ, bol v roku 2018 v Austrálii, aby hovoril s vedúcimi katolíckeho ministerstva a preživšími.<br/><br/>Michael McVeigh z Jezuitskej komunikácie sa s ním počas návštevy posadil, aby preskúmal, ako Cirkev reaguje na krízu zneužívania na medzinárodnej úrovni a čo sa môžeme naučiť z našich skúseností v Austrálii.<br/><br/>MM: Toto je vaša tretia cesta do Austrálie. Navštívili ste niekoľko ďalších krajín, aby ste zistili, ako Cirkev reaguje na zneužívanie po celom svete. Môžete nám dať nejakú predstavu o tom, ako vyzerá globálny obraz?<br/><br/>Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>HZ: Po tom, čo som navštívil asi 50 krajín na piatich alebo šiestich kontinentoch, chápem, že Cirkev sa v posledných rokoch skutočne začína zaoberať otázkou spravodlivosti voči obetiam, načúvania im a robenia čohokoľvek, čo sa dá urobiť z hľadiska ochrany.<br/><br/>Koncom apríla som bol s jezuitskými provinciálmi z celej Afriky a prezident jezuitskej asistencie Afriky a Madagaskaru je tomuto veľmi oddaný a oddaný. Vypracoval dôkladný akčný plán pre formáciu a zavedenie usmernení všade. Je to veľmi ohľaduplné a veľmi cieľavedomé úsilie urobiť čokoľvek, čo sa dá urobiť, aby sme sa aktívne angažovali ako jezuiti v Afrike – na kontinente, kde ešte pred niekoľkými rokmi bolo toto všetko cudzím jazykom.<br/><br/>Jednou z výziev pri rozvíjaní tohto globálneho prístupu je, že sa zaoberáte toľkými kultúrami a toľkými rôznymi porozumeniami. Ako to zjednotiť a pokúsiť sa poskytnúť odbornú prípravu a podporu náboženským komunitám, ktoré sa zaoberajú týmito otázkami?<br/><br/>To je jedna z hlavných otázok, ktoré máme. Myslím, že to, čo môžem urobiť, je stimulovať diskusiu, stimulovať reflexiu a pripraviť ľudí čo najviac, aby mohli robiť základy.<br/><br/>Centrum pre ochranu detí na Gregoriánskej univerzite nepredstiera, že má odpoveď na každú otázku. Nielen preto, že nepoznáme konkrétne súvislosti - možno ich poznáme niekoľko, ale hovoríme o tisícoch kultúr, hovoríme o stovkách jazykov, hovoríme o veľmi rôznorodých právnych základoch. To sa líši aj niekedy v rámci jednej krajiny, ako je Austrália, kde máte štáty v rámci Spoločenstva Austrálie, ktoré majú iné zákony ako iné štáty.<br/><br/>Som niekto, kto sa snaží vyvolať a stimulovať diskusiu a reflexiu. Som tiež veľmi rád, že počúvam ľudí.<br/><br/>Zrejme sme mali Kráľovskú komisiu tu v Austrálii, ale aké sú niektoré z ďalších spôsobov, že ste videli, že hlasy obetí sú podporované po celom svete?<br/><br/>Vo Francúzsku je jedna diecéza, ktorá založila to, čo nazývajú "Počujúci priestor". Tam môžu obete vystúpiť a môžu sa vyjadriť. Biskup je prítomný. Je to otvorený priestor, v ktorom sú ľudia, ktorí boli nesmierne zranení, aspoň slobodní, aby vyjadrili to, čo chcú žiadať od vedenia Cirkvi atď.<br/><br/>Existujú aj iné miesta v USA alebo v iných krajinách, kde boli obete pozvané diecézami, provinciami, vedením Cirkvi, aby sa prihlásili. Musím povedať, že celkovo si myslím, že existuje dobrá vôľa a je viac ľudí, ako sú biskupi a provinciáli, ktorí počúvajú obete, než si uvedomujeme. Neexistuje však jediný model, ktorý by obetiam poskytoval nielen priestor na vyjadrenie a počúvanie, ale aj na aktívnu účasť na rozvoji Cirkvi.<br/><br/>Čo sa týka zriadenia priestorov na podporu obetí, aké sú niektoré veci, ktoré ste videli, ktoré by mohli skutočne pomôcť - a ktoré by sme mohli zvážiť tu v Austrálii?<br/><br/>Jedným z hlavných bodov, ktoré mnohé obete vyvolávajú, je: "Nemôžeme mať v rámci farských prostredí, v školských prostrediach pravidelný rozhovor, ktorý zahŕňa tých, ktorí prežili zneužívanie ako riadni členovia výboru, komisie, Sounding Board, skupiny spätnej väzby alebo niečo také?" Takže tento hlas sa neprináša len pri konkrétnej príležitosti, alebo tam, kde sa človek cíti, že je v bode, aby o tom mohol hovoriť, ale je pravidelne počuť - vybudovať tento hlas do systému.<br/><br/>To nám všetkým pomôže. Pomôže pozostalým a obetiam, pretože sa budú cítiť vítaní a oceňovaní v konkrétnej skúsenosti a v konkrétnych životných výzvach, ktorými prešli. Po druhé, pomôže to komunite ako celku, pretože sa môžeme stať čoraz citlivejšími na to, aké sú obavy a špecifické potreby tých, ktorí prežili, ktoré môžu tiež hovoriť o potrebách mladých ľudí.<br/><br/>M: Máme tu v Austrálii silné skupiny preživších, ktorí sa počas tohto procesu dokázali navzájom podporovať. Ale hovoríte, že potrebujeme nejaký spôsob podpory týchto skupín a podpory týchto ľudí aj prostredníctvom našich vlastných inštitúcií?<br/><br/>A myslím si, že musíme byť kreatívni. Bude to fungovať pre jednu školu a jednu farnosť a jednu diecézu jedným spôsobom a pre ostatných iným spôsobom. Pretože preživší, s ktorými som v neustálom kontakte, majú veľmi podobné požiadavky a skúsenosti, pokiaľ ide o prijatie v Cirkvi alebo nie – cítia sa vyhodení alebo zavrhnutí. Naučil som sa teda, že musíte byť veľmi ústretový v prijímaní rozdielov v tom, čo táto konkrétna skupina, alebo tento konkrétny preživší, chce, požaduje a potrebuje.<br/><br/>M: Preživší hovoria o tom, že chcú, aby ich príbehy boli vypočuté a uznané. Máme Kráľovskú komisiu tu v Austrálii, ktorá poskytla nezávislý proces, kde by sa obete mohli prihlásiť. Je niečo také potrebné z hľadiska pravdy, spravodlivosti a procesu zmierenia pre Cirkev na medzinárodnej úrovni?<br/><br/>H: Áno, myslím si, že je to potrebné na medzinárodnej úrovni. Ale myslím si, že v prvom rade si každá miestna cirkev musí urobiť svoju vlastnú domácu úlohu. Nevidím, že by sa stalo veľmi skoro, že by sa zriadila nejaká taká rada alebo komisia, ktorá by preskúmala túto oblasť pre celú Cirkev. Cirkev má 1,3 miliardy členov a je prítomná v 190 krajinách, s rôznymi rozdielmi v očakávaniach, pokiaľ ide o psychologickú, duchovnú a finančnú podporu.<br/><br/>Pri komunikácii s obeťami, pri práci s nimi a pri počúvaní obetí sa stretávam s jednou vecou, a tou je, že chcú byť vypočuté. Ak by teda existoval pocit, že obete sú neustále počúvané – v Ríme aj inde – myslím, že by to mnohým obetiam poskytlo veľkú úľavu.<br/><br/>Myslím si, že znepokojenie, najmä pokiaľ ide o vašu otázku, spočíva v tom, že miestne cirkvi robia všetko, čo je v ich silách, aby obete boli v tejto konkrétnej krajine vypočuté. Mám zoznam ľudí, ktorí chcú hovoriť priamo so Svätým Otcom a fyzicky to nie je možné. Bol som tam v roku 2014, aby som preložil pre dvoch nemeckých preživších, ktorí boli vybraní s dvoma írskymi a dvoma anglickými preživšími, keď dostal šesť z nich doma. Celé ráno ich počúval jeden po druhom. Pre každého z nich, bol tam 40 až 45 minút. Ak by to urobil pre každého, kto prežil, už nemohol spať.<br/><br/>Jeho príkladom je modelovanie pre celú Katolícku cirkev spôsob, akým sú obete a pozostalí prijímaní, vítaní a počúvaní. Myslím si, že ak by biskupi a provinciá tohto sveta, vo všetkých krajinách, nasledovali jeho príklad, mnohí preživší by si toho skutočne vážili.<br/><br/>Arcibiskup Diarmud Martin bol nedávno citovaný tesne pred Svetovým stretnutím rodín, o Pápežskej komisii, povedal, že je príliš malá, pretože je v súčasnosti nastavená na to, aby dosiahla to, čo potrebuje na dosiahnutie. Potrebuje Cirkev vynaložiť viac prostriedkov na to, ako dohliada na tieto otázky?<br/><br/>V súčasnosti máme 16 členov zo všetkých kontinentov a hlavných jazykových skupín. Zastupujeme rôzne disciplíny a profesie a účelom komisie – ako práve vyhlásených štatútov – je poskytnúť radu Svätému Otcovi.<br/><br/>Bežné nedorozumenie o komisii je prvé, že sa zaoberáme prípadmi obvinení. Nemáme žiadnu právnu alebo administratívnu moc, pokiaľ ide o prípady, pretože pokiaľ ide o obvinenia zo zneužívania, tribunály a postupy sú stanovené.<br/><br/>Druhým nedorozumením je, že priamo podporujeme veci v teréne. Naším prvoradým cieľom je, aby sme v otázkach radili Svätému Otcovi.<br/><br/>Takže z môjho pohľadu áno, musíme investovať viac. Musíme však investovať viac na miestnej úrovni a musíme zabezpečiť, aby návrhy Pápežskej komisie boli postúpené Svätému Otcovi – čo zvyčajne robí prezident – a potom nasleduje proces, ktorý odráža to, čo sme dali ako našu radu.<br/><br/>V Austrálii Catholic Professional Standards Limited dohliada na reakciu Cirkvi a poskytuje usmernenia a podporu pre zabezpečenie všetkých inštitúcií v Cirkvi ako inštitúcií bezpečných pre deti. Je potrebná nejaká organizačná podpora zo strany Ríma pre tých biskupov a diecéz, ktorí sa snažia vytvoriť tieto inštitúcie a zabezpečiť ochranu v týchto diecézach?<br/><br/>Myslím si, že v konečnom dôsledku sa Komisia bude vyvíjať v tejto línii. Teraz sú v procese prijímania odborníkov v týchto oblastiach.<br/><br/>Myslím si, že Cirkev musí pochopiť, že miestne cirkvi sa môžu navzájom učiť. A moje chápanie bolo vždy - a myslím, že nám to Svätý Otec pripomenul -, že Cirkev nebude fungovať ako centralizovaná spoločnosť. Takto to nefunguje, efektívne. Každý biskup, každá biskupská konferencia, má do určitej miery svoj vlastný život. Čo sa musíme naučiť viac, je otvoriť kanály vzájomnej komunikácie.<br/><br/>Existuje niekoľko vecí, ktoré ľudia obviňujú zo zneužívania v Cirkvi. Ako kňaz a psychológ, a ako niekto, kto sa stretol a pracoval s preživšími, aké sú vaše myšlienky na túto tému?<br/><br/>Myslím si, že otázka, odkiaľ zneužívanie pochádza, je najdôležitejšia a pápež to adresoval vo svojom liste Božiemu ľudu, ktorý bol zverejnený 20. augusta. V prvom odseku hovorí a opakuje to znova a znova, že otázka sexuálneho zneužívania je vždy – alebo takmer vždy – spojená nielen s otázkou zneužívania moci, ale aj so zneužívaním svedomia.<br/><br/>Takže skutočná základná otázka zneužívania je oveľa zložitejšia ako otázka sexuality – či už heterosexuálnej alebo homosexuálnej. Je to otázka moci a tam musíme skutočne pracovať na otázke, ako chápeme kňazstvo, ako chápeme biskupstvo, ako chápeme a žijeme naše služby? Aké sú hranice?<br/><br/>Preto som veľmi rád, že jezuitská provincia v Austrálii zaviedla kódex správania, pretože nehovoríme len o sexuálnom zneužívaní maloletých. Hovoríme o sexuálnom zneužívaní dospelých a hovoríme o zneužívaní inými spôsobmi - ako je zneužívanie svedomia, kde niekomu diktujete, čo si myslíte, alebo predstierate, že viete od Boha, a môžete povedať inej osobe: "Musíte to urobiť", proti svedomiu tejto osoby.<br/><br/>Mnoho ľudí si myslí, že celibát spôsobuje zneužívanie. Ako vždy hovorím, celibát ako taký nie je dôvodom na zneužívanie – ako inak vysvetlíme, že 99,9 percenta všetkých násilníkov nežije v celibáte a ako vysvetlíme, že 95 alebo 96 percent všetkých kňazov nezneužíva maloletých? Ale celibát alebo sľub čistoty, ktorý nie je skutočne integrovaný, ktorý nie je skutočne správne žitý – áno, to vytvára problém. Niekedy ľudia berú na pitie, niekedy na hazardné hry a niekedy na sexuálne zneužitie, s dospelými a s maloletými.<br/><br/>Skutočnou otázkou je, ako sa vyrovnáme s pojmom náboženskej duchovnej moci, do ktorej sú zapojení kňazi a biskupi?

| I'm not surprised by this mismatch. In fact, I'd even go so far as to say this isn't something that will ever change, nor should we get all steamed up about changing it. In 10 years, we'll still have bleeding edge, complex items in the biggest concerns list, and the things we're finally getting around to understanding will be the major parts of our spending.<br/><br/>Now, Gunnar and Andy both have excellent points, specifically about IT teams seeing IT problems and solving them with IT solutions; in fact, I'm positive their points hold merit.<br/><br/>But I think there are other ideas that trump those (I did comment on their blogs about it, and later decided I should just blog here). Those top 3 concerns are bleedingly new such that:<br/><br/>we fear new things because we don't understand them, or don't understand them because they're new.<br/><br/>they're too new for us to have solid approaches to handling them.<br/><br/>they're too new for us to know if we should be worried or not! we tend to default to paranoid/worried, which is good!<br/><br/>too new to have obvious budget items assigned to them. Can I buy a box or some software that provide "cloud security" or "social media security?"<br/><br/>they're so new the business doesn't even know how to use them or what they want out of them. Let alone how we can secure them while still meeting or at least not stomping all over business needs. If the business doesn't even know how to use them yet, I'm not sure security is in any position to guide that usage securely.<br/><br/>It also should be mentioned that these new things are being largely pushed via consumerland and into the business, with IT as a sort of, "Oh yeah," thought. Firewalls, AV, AM, Auth are all IT responses to typically IT issues. Of course there is a difference there. They're also very subjective issues, as opposed to very objective items like firewalls, known malicious bits, behaviors, signatures, ports. Business presents very complex issues that are often involving people (which we can't patch) and that often don't fit nicely into blanket rules. Even if we turned away from technical solutions and devoted our time into solving these problems, they are still not going to be neatly solved. Likewise, when push comes to shove, can you have and meet goals with firewalls? Can you show improvement? All of this flows from the rather subjective non-technical aspect of those issues. Sort of the difference between a child's report card and the feedback you get from a parent-teacher conference. If you have a child, which one would you be most inclined to disagree with or not necessarily believe? (The answer is the subjective one!)<br/><br/>It could be said this is the natural progression of security and technology: from shoring up the technical controls to moving up the stack towards behavior and people. Sure, these 3 top concerns can be said to punch through firewalls and network segments, but that's the nature of those things (social media "punching" through a firewall is far different than me punching through an SSH connection to bridge my home network; social media is akin to the *way* I use my SSH connection after the hold is already punched because it is needed; i.e. social media is the way port 80 is used.)<br/><br/>Basically, all indications point to not being surprised by this dichotomy. And I don't think this is some further indication that IT/security is doing it wrong, or isn't aligned properly with business, or has a technical dark-server-room background. I'm not saying we're doing things right or we're properly aligned, but the above isn't a good argument to support the theory of those deficiencies.<br/><br/>Now for a really big jump. I'd liken the current increase in mobile computing to be as big as the introduction of computers into the business and later the PC/internet into business. Now, I wasn't around when the former happened, nor was I in the industry when the personal computer revolution swept into business, but I would bet that is the closest comparison so far. I may even say the same for social media. These are damned new and they're big changes beyond just bringing in Macs or new software or some new business process. | V skutočnosti by som dokonca zašiel tak ďaleko, že by som povedal, že to nie je niečo, čo sa nikdy nezmení, ani by sme nemali byť všetci nahnevaní na zmenu. O 10 rokov budeme mať stále krvavú hranicu, komplexné položky v zozname najväčších obáv a veci, ktoré sa konečne dostávame k pochopeniu, budú hlavnými časťami našich výdavkov.<br/><br/>Teraz majú Gunnar a Andy vynikajúce body, konkrétne o IT tímoch, ktoré vidia IT problémy a riešia ich pomocou IT riešení; v skutočnosti som si istý, že ich body majú zásluhu.<br/><br/>Ale myslím, že existujú aj iné nápady, ktoré prevyšujú tie (Ja som komentoval ich blogy o tom, a neskôr sa rozhodol, že by som mal len blog tu). Tieto top 3 obavy sú krvácajúco nové také, že:<br/><br/>Bojíme sa nových vecí, pretože im nerozumieme, alebo im nerozumieme, pretože sú nové.<br/><br/>Sú pre nás príliš nové na to, aby sme mali solídne prístupy k ich riešeniu.<br/><br/>Sú príliš nové na to, aby sme vedeli, či by sme sa mali obávať alebo nie! máme tendenciu byť paranoidní / znepokojení, čo je dobré!<br/><br/>príliš nový, aby im boli pridelené zjavné rozpočtové položky. Môžem si kúpiť krabicu alebo nejaký softvér, ktorý poskytuje "cloud security" alebo "social media security?"<br/><br/>Sú tak nové, že firma ani nevie, ako ich používať, alebo čo od nich chce. Nehovoriac o tom, ako ich môžeme zabezpečiť, zatiaľ čo sa stále stretávame, alebo aspoň nestúpame po všetkých obchodných potrebách. Ak firma ešte nevie, ako ich používať, nie som si istý, či je bezpečnosť v akejkoľvek pozícii, aby bezpečne usmerňovala toto použitie.<br/><br/>Treba tiež spomenúť, že tieto nové veci sú do značnej miery tlačené cez spotrebnú krajinu a do podnikania, s IT ako "Oh yeah", myslel. Firewally, AV, AM, Auth sú všetky IT odpovede na typicky IT problémy. Samozrejme, že je tam rozdiel. Sú to tiež veľmi subjektívne problémy, na rozdiel od veľmi objektívnych položiek, ako sú firewally, známe škodlivé bity, správanie, podpisy, porty. Podnikanie predstavuje veľmi zložité problémy, ktoré sa často týkajú ľudí (ktoré nemôžeme opraviť) a ktoré často nezodpovedajú pravidlám. Aj keď sme sa odvrátili od technických riešení a venovali svoj čas na riešenie týchto problémov, stále nebudú úhľadne vyriešené. Podobne, keď príde na strkať, môžete mať a splniť ciele s firewallmi? Môžete ukázať zlepšenie? To všetko vyplýva z dosť subjektívneho netechnického aspektu týchto otázok. Rozdiel medzi vysvědčením dieťaťa a spätnou väzbou, ktorú získate z konferencie rodičov-učiteľov. Ak máte dieťa, s ktorým by ste boli najviac naklonení nesúhlasiť alebo tomu nutne neveriť? (Odpoveď je subjektívna!)<br/><br/>Dalo by sa povedať, že je to prirodzený vývoj bezpečnosti a technológie: od podpory technických kontrol až po posun smerom k správaniu a ľuďom. Iste, tieto 3 hlavné obavy možno povedať, že preraziť cez firewally a sieťové segmenty, ale to je povaha týchto vecí (sociálne médiá "dieranie" cez firewall je ďaleko odlišná od mňa dierovanie cez pripojenie SSH na premostenie mojej domácej siete; sociálne médiá sú podobné * spôsobom * používam moje pripojenie SSH po tom, čo je už razené, pretože je to potrebné; t. j. sociálne médiá je spôsob, akým sa používa port 80).<br/><br/>V podstate všetky indikácie poukazujú na to, že nie sú prekvapení touto dichotómiou. A nemyslím si, že je to nejaký ďalší náznak toho, že IT / bezpečnosť to robí zle, alebo nie je správne v súlade s podnikaním, alebo má technické temné pozadie serverovej miestnosti. Nehovorím, že robíme veci správne alebo že sme správne zladení, ale vyššie uvedené nie je dobrým argumentom na podporu teórie týchto nedostatkov.<br/><br/>Teraz pre naozaj veľký skok. Chcel by som prirovnať súčasný nárast v oblasti mobilných počítačov, aby bol taký veľký ako zavedenie počítačov do podnikania a neskôr do PC / internetu do podnikania. Nebol som nablízku, keď sa stalo to prvé, ani som nebol v priemysle, keď sa revolúcia osobných počítačov dostala do podnikania, ale stavím sa, že to je zatiaľ najbližšie porovnanie. Sú to sakramentsky nové a sú to veľké zmeny, ktoré presahujú len prinesenie Macov alebo nového softvéru alebo nejakého nového obchodného procesu. |
