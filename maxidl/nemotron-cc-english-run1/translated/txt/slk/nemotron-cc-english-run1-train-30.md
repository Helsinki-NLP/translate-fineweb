Undocumented migrants have nothing. They are not allowed to work. They have no right to state benefits nor to a place to live. They are unseen and potentially the most vulnerable group in the UK today.<br/><br/>Undocumented (or irregular) migrants include those trafficked into the sex trade or for domestic servitude; they include visa overstayers; those whose asylum applications have been refused and others who have been subject to failures in the immigration system. All of these may originally have come to the UK legally.<br/><br/>'Illegal immigrants' – those imagined to have entered the country in the backs of lorries – make up a small proportion of the undocumented.<br/><br/>Indeed some sources suggest that half the estimated 120,000 undocumented children in the UK were actually born here to undocumented parents. These children are disadvantaged from birth, solely by their immigration status.<br/><br/>The blog tells the stories of the undocumented. It highlights their daily struggles and vulnerabilities, but also their strength and resilience. It's not an easy read.<br/><br/>You can access the blog via our website (bottom of right hand column on Home Page).<br/><br/>The blog has won the online category of the Speaking Together media awards. The awards were a new addition this year to the Migrant and Refugee Woman of the Year Awards celebration at the Royal Festival Hall in London as part of International Women's Day. The panel of judges – including novelist and playwright Gillian Slovo, and journalist and author, Hannah Pool – was particularly looking for work that challenged myths and stereotypes.<br/><br/>The blog has also won the Blog North Awards 2013 in the Best Writing category and was also shortlisted for an Amnesty International Media Award. | Navigácia<br/><br/>"Život bez dokumentov" získal cenu za najlepšie písanie<br/><br/>Blogový projekt "Life Without Papers", ktorý vytvoril Len Grant, predstavuje príbehy rodín migrantov bez dokladov a mladých ľudí. Nedokumentovaní migranti nemajú nič. Nemajú dovolené pracovať. Nemajú právo na štátne dávky ani na miesto na bývanie. V súčasnosti sú neviditeľnou a potenciálne najzraniteľnejšou skupinou v Spojenom kráľovstve.<br/><br/>Medzi nedokumentovaných (alebo neregulárnych) migrantov patria tí, s ktorými sa obchoduje v obchode so sexom alebo kvôli domácemu otroctvu; medzi nich patria osoby, ktoré prekročili povolenú dĺžku pobytu; osoby, ktorých žiadosti o azyl boli zamietnuté, a iné osoby, ktoré boli predmetom zlyhaní v imigračnom systéme. Všetky z nich mohli pôvodne prísť do Spojeného kráľovstva legálne.<br/><br/>"Nelegálni prisťahovalci" - tí, ktorí si predstavovali, že vstúpili do krajiny na chrbte nákladných automobilov - tvoria malú časť nezdokumentovaných.<br/><br/>V skutočnosti niektoré zdroje naznačujú, že polovica z odhadovaných 120 000 detí bez dokladov v Spojenom kráľovstve sa tu skutočne narodila rodičom bez dokladov. Tieto deti sú znevýhodnené od narodenia, výlučne ich imigračným statusom.<br/><br/>Blog rozpráva príbehy nezdokumentovaných. Zdôrazňuje ich každodenné boje a zraniteľnosti, ale aj ich silu a odolnosť. Nie je to ľahké čítanie.<br/><br/>Na blog sa môžete dostať prostredníctvom našej webovej stránky (v pravom dolnom rohu stĺpca na domovskej stránke).<br/><br/>Blog vyhral online kategóriu mediálnych ocenení Speaking Together. Ocenenia boli v tomto roku novým prírastkom k oslave ocenenia Migrant and Refugee Woman of the Year v Royal Festival Hall v Londýne v rámci Medzinárodného dňa žien. Porota - vrátane spisovateľky a dramatičky Gillian Slovo a novinárky a autorky Hannah Poolovej - hľadala najmä prácu, ktorá spochybnila mýty a stereotypy.<br/><br/>Blog získal aj ocenenie Blog North Awards 2013 v kategórii Best Writing a bol tiež nominovaný na cenu Amnesty International Media Award. |
| Sabbath School Lesson<br/><br/>In Galatians, Paul tackles issues such as freedom, the role of the law in salvation, our condition in Christ, and the nature of the Spirit-led life, as well as the age-old question, How can sinful humans be made right before a holy and just God?<br/><br/>Many scholars believe that Galatians may be the earliest of Paul's letters. It was written in A.D. 49, shortly after the famous Jerusalem Council (Acts 15). Therefore, the book may be the oldest Christian document known. As Acts and Galatians make clear, the early church found itself in a fierce battle over the nature of salvation, especially in the case of Gentiles. According to a group of Jewish believers, known as Judaizers, belief in Jesus alone was not good enough for Gentiles. Gentiles must also be circumcised and follow the laws of Moses (Acts 15:1).<br/><br/>This quarter's Bible study guide invites us to journey with the apostle Paul as he pleads with the Galatians to remain true to Jesus. It also gives us a chance to reflect on our own understanding of the truths that opened the way for Martin Luther's ultimate break with Rome and the restoration of the biblical gospel. | Sabbath School Lekcia<br/><br/>V Galaťanom sa Pavol venuje otázkam, ako je sloboda, úloha zákona v spasení, náš stav v Kristovi a povaha života vedeného Duchom, ako aj odveká otázka: Ako môžu byť hriešni ľudia učinení spravodlivými pred svätým a spravodlivým Bohom?<br/><br/>Mnohí učenci sa domnievajú, že Galatským môže byť najstarší z Pavlových listov. To bolo napísané v roku 49 nl, krátko po slávnom jeruzalemskom koncile (Skutky 15). Preto, kniha môže byť najstarší kresťanský dokument známy. Ako objasňujú Skutky a Galaťanom, raná cirkev sa ocitla v neľútostnom boji o prirodzenosť spásy, najmä v prípade pohanov. Podľa skupiny židovských veriacich, známych ako Judaizers, viera v Ježiša sám nebol dosť dobrý pre pohanov. pohania musia byť tiež obrezaní a dodržiavať zákony Mojžiša (Skutky 15:1).<br/><br/>Sprievodca biblickým štúdiom v tejto štvrti nás pozýva na cestu s apoštolom Pavlom, keď prosí Galaťanov, aby zostali verní Ježišovi. Dáva nám tiež možnosť zamyslieť sa nad vlastným chápaním právd, ktoré otvorili cestu pre konečný rozchod Martina Luthera s Rímom a obnovenie biblického evanjelia. |

Franz Frederick Karl Ludwig Georg Heinrich, Frederick Wilhelm Karl Joseph Ludwig Georg. Frederick bol považovaný za populárny a inteligentný, počas svojej vlády spolu so svojou krásnou manželkou Charlottou dosiahol kultúrny život v malom meste svoj zenit. Toľko básnikov a umelcov tam strávilo svoj čas, že Hildburghausen bol prezývaný Klein-Weimar, keď posledný vojvoda Sasko-Gothsko-Altenbursko zomrel bez problému v roku 1825, ostatné pobočky domu rozhodli o preskupení Ernestínskych vojvodstiev. Dňa 12. novembra 1826 sa Fridrich stal vojvodom Sasko-Altenburským, ktorému dal prvý Základný zákon v roku 1831, výmenou za médiá týkajúce sa Fridricha, vojvodu Sasko-Altenburského vo Wikimedia Commons geneall. net<br/><br/>Fridrich Sasko-Altenburský<br/>–<br/>Frederick<br/><br/>15.<br/>Vojvodkyňa Charlotte Georgine z Meklenburska-Strelitz<br/>–<br/>Charlotte Georgine sa narodila v Hannoveri, voliteľovi Brunšvicko-Läneburgu. Bola najstarším dieťaťom a dcérou Karola II., veľkovojvodu meklenburského, Šarloty a jej sestier, pruskej kráľovnej Louise, hannoverskej kráľovnej Frederiky a princeznej Terézie z Thurn und Taxis, boli považované za najkrajšie ženy svojej doby. Jean Paul Friedrich Richter venoval svoj román Titan na štyri krásne, Charlotte vyrastal v Hannoveri, kde jej otec slúžil ako guvernér, v mene svojho švagra, kráľa Juraja III Spojeného kráľovstva, ktorý žil v Londýne. Keď mala Charlotte dvanásť rokov, jej matka zomrela a vychovávala ju jej sestra Charlotte, ktorá sa v roku 1784 vydala za svojho otca a jej sestry priviedla jej babička Maria Louise Albertine z Leiningen-Falkenburg-Dagsburg v Darmstadte. Charlotte sa potom presťahovala do Hildburghausenu. 3. septembra 1785, vo veku pätnástich rokov, sa vydala za vojvodu Fredericka, vojvodu zo Saska-Altenburska, manželstvo nebolo šťastné, Charlotte bola mentálne nadradená Frederickovi, ktorý ju začal ignorovať. Mali tiež problémy, Sasko-Hildburghausen bol finančne zničený katastrofálnou politikou Frederickových predchodcov. Prijímatelia umožnili vojvodovi a vojvodkyni iba znížený občiansky zoznam, otec Charlotte a dvaja bratia často zostali s Charlottou v Hildburghausene. V roku 1787 sa natrvalo presťahovala do Hildburghausenu a stala sa prezidentkou úverového výboru. V roku 1792 Charlotte babička a jej sestry utiekli pred postupujúcou francúzskou armádou z Darmstadtu do Hildburghausenu a jej babička si všimla manžela Charlotte. Zo všetkých svojich povinností plní svoje manželské povinnosti s horlivosťou. Charlotte, ktorá nikdy nemilovala tohto muža, je vždy tehotná, rodina strávila niekoľko bezstarostných týždňov v Hildburghausene. V roku 1793 sa Charlottena stará mama vrátila z exilu a cestovala so sestrami Charlotte do Frankfurtu nad Mohanom, Charlotte mala veľmi intímny a milujúci vzťah so svojou sestrou Friederike a príbuznými v Strelitz. V rokoch 1803 a 1805 pruský kráľovský pár navštívil Hildburghausen, pri tejto príležitosti príjemcovia umožnili vojvodskému páru obnoviť časť svojho nábytku. Louise pomáhala navrhnúť vyhlásenie vojny, Christian Truchse von Wetzhausen zu Bettenburg bol priateľom vojvodského páru a krstným otcom syna Charlotte Edwarda. Mnohí diváci sa prišli pozrieť na bavorskú korunnú princeznú, keď prijímala svojich hostí, Truchsea sa pokúsila viesť nižšiu Charlottu najprv do svojho hradu, ale odmietla s odkazom na svoju dcéru. Truchsea odpovedala, Vaša Výsosť mi odpustí, ale pokiaľ tu tento hrad stál, Theresa potom chytila barónov druhú ruku a traja z nich spoločne prešli bránou. Vojvodkyňa dala asi polovicu svojho príjmu chudobným, dôchodcom<br/><br/>1617.<br/>Princ Charles z Hesenska-Kasselska<br/>–<br/>Princ Charles z Hesse-Kassel bol kadetom v dome Hesse-Kassel a dánskym poľným maršálom. Vychovaný s príbuznými na dánskom dvore, strávil väčšinu svojho života v Dánsku a jeho matka bola dcéra kráľa Juraja II Veľkej Británie a Caroline Ansbach a sestra kráľovnej Louise Dánska. Jeho otec, budúci landgrave, opustil rodinu v roku 1747, v roku 1755 formálne ukončil manželstvo s Máriou. Starý otec, Viliam VIII., Landgrave of Hesse, udelil kraj Hanau a jeho príjmy Márii, mladý princ Charles a jeho dvaja bratia, William a Frederick, boli vychovávaní svojou matkou a podporovaní protestantskými príbuznými od roku 1747. V roku 1756 sa Mária presťahovala do Dánska, aby sa starala o neplnoleté deti svojej sestry, dánskej kráľovnej Louise. S ňou vzala svojich synov, ktorí boli vychovaní na dvore v paláci Christiansborg v Kodani. Hessskí princovia neskôr zostali v Dánsku a stali sa jeho dôležitými pánmi, len najstarší brat William sa vrátil do Hesenska v roku 1785 po vzostupe landgraviate. Charles začal kariéru v Dánsku. V roku 1758 bol menovaný plukovníkom, vo veku 20 rokov generálmajorom, tiež v roku 1766 bol menovaný generálnym guvernérom Nórska, pozíciu, ktorú zastával až do roku 1768, ale ktorá zostala väčšinou titulárna, pretože počas tohto obdobia nikdy nešiel do Nórska. V roku 1763 sa jeho starší brat William oženil s ich prvým bratrancom, Charles ho nasledoval 30. augusta 1766 v paláci Christiansborg - jeho manželkou bola Louise Dánska a Charles sa tak stal švagrom svojho bratranca, kráľa Christiana VII. Manželstvo sa uskutočnilo napriek radám, ktoré boli proti nemu, kvôli obvineniu princa Charlesa z hýrenia. Krátko nato, Charles upadol do nemilosti na súde, a na začiatku roku 1767 on a oni by mať svoje prvé dieťa, Marie Sophie, tam v roku 1767 a potom ich druhé dieťa, William, v roku 1769. V roku 1768 kúpil Charles od rodiny Edelsheimovcov majetok a dedinu Offenbach-Rumpenheim. V roku 1771 nechal panstvo rozšíriť na hrad a kniežacie sídlo a jeho matka Mária žila v paláci až do svojej smrti v roku 1772. V roku 1781, Charles predal Rumpenheim palác svojmu mladšiemu bratovi, Charles sa usadil na hrade Gottorp v Schleswig so svojou rodinou. V roku 1771 sa im narodilo tretie dieťa Frederick, v roku 1770 kráľ Christian VII. daroval svojej sestre majetok Tegelhof v Goethe medzi mestom Schleswig a Eckernfärde. Od 1772 do 1776, Charles mal letné sídlo postavené na mieste, ktoré pomenoval Louisenlund na počesť jeho manželky, v septembri 1772, Charles bol menovaný veliteľ-in-šéf nórskej armády a on a Louise sa presťahoval do Christiana. Pridelenie bolo dôsledkom štátneho prevratu švédskeho kráľa Gustava III. 19. augusta 1772, zatiaľ čo v Nórsku porodila princezná Louise svoje štvrté dieťa Juliane v roku 1773.<br/><br/>18.<br/>Louise Caroline z Hesenska-Kasselska<br/>–<br/>Louise Caroline sa narodila v Gottorpe v vojvodstve Schleswig lankraběťa Karolovi Hesensko-Kasselskému a jeho manželke princeznej Louise Dánskej.

Je považovaný za zakladateľa Casa dEste, keďže bol hlavou prvej rodiny, ktorá sa stala pánom Este, Alberto Azzo II bol jediným synom Alberta Azzo I., markraběte z Milána. Kolom roku 1020 zdedil svoje otcovské úrady a v rokoch 1069 – 1070 sa snažil získať Maine pre svojho syna Hugha, pretože jeho manželka Garsende bola spoludedičkou predchádzajúcich grófstiev Maine. Hugh bol vyhlásený za grófa, ale nemohol zvíťaziť nad Robertom, vojvodom z Normandie, v investitúrnom spore medzi Henrichom IV., cisárom Svätej ríše a pápežom Gregorom VII., Azzo sa pokúsil sprostredkovať, ale neskôr sa pripojil na stranu pápeža. Okolo roku 1073 si postavil zámok v Este, z ktorého bol dom Este pred jeho stavebným projektom o niečo viac ako dedina. Jeho syn Welf sa presťahoval najprv do Korutánska a potom do Bavorska, čo viedlo k vzniku jednej z najdôležitejších rodín v európskej histórii, ďalší syn, Fulk I. z Milána, urobil prvé zdokumentované použitie titulu Marquis dEste. Azzo II ženatý Kunigunde, dcéra Welf II, gróf z Altdorfu a mali jedno známe dieťa, Welf vojvoda Bavorska od 1070 do 1077 a 1096 až do svojej smrti, ktorý bol prvým členom Welf vetvy rodu Este.

Niektoré zdroje hovoria, že sa tiež oženil s Vitaliou Orseolo, dcérou Petra Orseola a mal mimomanželský vzťah s Matildou, sestrou Williama, biskupa z Padovy, s ktorou mal dcéru menom Adelasia, ktorá sa vydala za Guglielma Adelardiho.

Bol prvým členom Welfovej vetvy rodu Este, v genealógii staršieho rodu Welfov sa počíta ako Welf IV. Welf bol synom Azza II. z Este a jeho manželky Kunigunde z Altdorfu, keď Welfsov strýko z matkinej strany, Welf, vojvoda z Korutánska, zomrel bezdetný, Welf zdedil jeho majetok. Welf sa oženil s Ethelindou zo Northeimu, dcérou bavorského vojvodu Otta II., keď sa jeho svokor, vojvoda Otto, stal nepriateľom kráľa Henricha IV. a stratil jeho vojvodstvo, Welf zostal kráľovi verný. V súlade s Henrichovými príkazmi zavrhol a rozviedol svoju vojvodkyňu Ethelindu a táto udalosť sa konala v Goslare v roku 1070, keď sa bavorské štáty v tichosti podrobili novovytvorenému vojvodovi, ktorý bol zástupcom jednej z najstarších rodín v provincii. Jeho odmietnutie vojvodkyne, ktoré by mohli považovať za akt nespravodlivosti. Pápež a cisár boli povrchne zmierení v roku 1076, ale rok ich opäť videl v aktívnom nepriateľstve. Henrich v dôsledku opakovaných rebélií vyhlásil Welfa za zosadeného vo svojom novonadobudnutom vojvodstve. Avšak, podporovaný jeho vernými Bavormi a podporovaný jeho otcom v Taliansku, Welf si dokázal udržať svoje miesto, ale Gregor zomrel v roku 1085 a jeho nástupcovia sa menej intenzívne podieľali na záležitostiach Nemecka. Welf sa po rozvode v roku 1070 oženil s Judith z Flámska, dcérou Balduina IV., grófa z Flámska, a vdovou po Tostigovi Godwinsonovi, grófovi z Northumbrie. V roku 1089 sa Welfov syn Welf oženil s Matildou Toskánskou, čím posilnil vzťahy s pápežom, avšak po tom, čo sa mladší Welf rozviedol s Matildou v roku 1095, sa Welf zmieril s kráľom Henrichom IV. a bol opätovne potvrdený vo svojej pozícii bavorského vojvodu. Po smrti svojho otca Azza v roku 1097 sa Welf pokúsil získať majetok svojich otcov južne od Álp, v roku 1099 sa Welf pripojil k tomu, čo sa stalo známym ako križiacka výprava z roku 1101 spolu s Viliamom IX Akvitánskym, Hugom z Vermandois a Idou Rakúska. Jeho hlavným úspechom bolo zabrániť stretu medzi kolegami križiakmi, ktorí drancovali byzantské územie na ceste do Konštantínopolu, Welf sám unikol fiasku, ale zomrel na ceste späť do Paphosu na Cypre v roku 1101 a bol pochovaný vo Weingarten Abbey.

Henrich bol synom bavorského vojvodu Welfa I. z jeho manželstva s Juditou. Ako mladý muž spravoval majetok rodiny Este južne od Álp, cez manželstvo s Wulfhildou, dcérou vojvodu Magnusa Saského, okolo roku 1095 získal časť Billungských statkov okolo Läneburgu. Usiloval sa stať nástupcom svojho svokora ako saského vojvodu, keď Magnus v roku 1106 zomrel bez dedičov. Vojvoda Henrich napriek tomu udržiaval úzke vzťahy s vládnucou dynastiou Salian, v roku 1116 sa pripojil k cisárovi Henrichovi V. Nasledoval svojho staršieho brata Welfa II. ako bavorský vojvoda, keď zomrel bezdetný v roku 1120, Henrich bol tiež nápomocný pri realizácii Wormského konkordátu 1122, čím sa ukončil dlhotrvajúci spor medzi pápežom a cisárom. Manželstvo bolo uzavreté v máji 1127, odcudzenie medzi dynastiami Welf a Hohenstaufen trvalo až do 13. storočia. Po tom, čo Lothar vyhral voľby, uvalil na Fridricha II. imperiálny zákaz.

Obaja vstúpili do manželstva na jar roku 1202, spolu s poskytnutím významného vena a ich jediným dieťaťom bol Otto, ktorý zdedil majetok svojich otcov a v roku 1235 sa stal prvým vojvodom Brunšvicko-Läneburgu.

| Follow Us<br/><br/>ARE YOU AN<br/><br/>INSIDER<br/><br/>Craving Sugar? Here's What Your Body Is Trying to Tell You<br/><br/>by<br/>Byrdie<br/><br/>PHOTO:<br/><br/>Jacquemus<br/><br/>Weight gain from out-of-control cravings aside, it can be frustrating to have a constant hankering for something unhealthy and not know why. The good news is that there's usually a reason underlying that burning desire to house a bag of potato chips, or the feeling that you might actually die if you don't get a pickle rightthisinstant (even though you're not pregnant). If you're having visions of Milky Way bars, for example, it could mean that you're missing a very specific nutrient in your diet. (Yup—it's more complicated than said chocolate bar being so darn delicious.)<br/><br/>We talked to Los Angeles–based dietitian Shira Lenchewski, M.S., R.D., to get the skinny on some common food cravings, as well as what you can do to satiate the hunger without going overboard. Keep scrolling for some seriously good information!<br/><br/>If you're craving chocolate<br/><br/>It means: You could be lacking magnesium in your diet, says Lenchewski. "Magnesium is an essential mineral involved in energy production, glucose metabolism, and muscle function. This is especially true for those hitting the gym hard," she explains. Additionally, magnesium levels lower during the pre-menstrual weeks of your period, which explains why PMS so often comes with chocolate cravings.<br/><br/>Instead, reach for high-quality, low-sugar dark chocolate, which is naturally high in magnesium. "I recommend sticking to 75 per cent cocoa or higher, and pairing it with another magnesium-rich source like sunflower seeds," says Lenchewski. She suggests the chocolate brand Hu, a small-batch food company that focuses on high-quality ingredients produced locally. "It's a little pricey, but all the more reason to keep portions in check," she says. "It's my personal favourite." We're also big fans of superfood-packed Zenbunni.<br/><br/>If you're craving candy<br/><br/>It means: "Craving pure sugar is a good indication that you're running low on energy," says Lenchewski. "Think about it. What is the one thing you're itching for after a terrible night's sleep or at around 4 p.m. during a stressful workday? The answer is usually sugar because it's used as instant fuel for our body's cells."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for apples with nut butter. "If you're raiding your co-workers' candy stash, I recommend a more slow-burn carbohydrate with a source of fat or protein," says Lenchewski. "Unlike simple sugar, this will fuel your cells while avoiding the post-sugar crash. Two options that make for great pick-me-ups the next time you're craving candy: a sliced apple with your choice of nut butter, or berries with 2% unsweetened Greek yoghurt." We like quashing a sweet tooth with these addictive coconut chips, too—they're filling, free of any added sugar, and just so good.<br/><br/>If you're craving salt<br/><br/>It means: "If nothing but the saltiest pickle will do, you may not be drinking enough H2O," says Lenchewski. "Salt helps the body hold on to water, so we crave it when we're in need of fluids."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for water. "Stay hydrated, especially as we approach the summer months," she says. The next time a craving hits, try quenching it (literally) with a few refreshing glasses and you might find the urgency to sodium binge disappears. "If plain water bores you, try adding in mint, lemon, or frozen fruit to mix it up," says Lenchewski. And if that still doesn't do the trick, there's a healthier alternative to bagged chips or fries. "If you're really just craving salt after all, toasted seaweed is a great low-calorie option," she says.<br/><br/>If you're craving starchy carbs like pasta<br/><br/>It means: "Because high-carb foods boost the feel-good hormone serotonin, starch cravings can be a sign you're in need of a mood booster," says Lenchewski.<br/><br/>Instead, reach for a bath! "Bust out the Epsom salts, because it's time for some serious R+R," says Lenchewski. "Trust me. Indulging in a starch free-for-all feels really good in the moment, but it will likely bum you out more the next day." (As anyone who has ever over-indulged a pizza or pasta craving knows.) So the next time you want to dive head first into a bowl of carbs, draw a bath, light a candle, and treat yourself without any regret or dense calories.<br/><br/>If you're craving ice cream<br/><br/>5 / 6<br/><br/>It means: "Your body may be telling you it's in need of some healthy fat."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for coconut ice cream. "I'm a realist, so if you're craving ice cream, I'm not going to recommend a handful of walnuts, which are, of course, full of healthy fat," says Lenchewski. "For ice cream emergencies, I recommend lower-in-sugar coconut ice-creams like Coconut Bliss or Kippy's three-ingredient ice cream in Los Angeles." We can vouch for the fact that coconut ice cream tastes incredible and just like the real thing.<br/><br/>If you're craving a burger<br/><br/>It means: You need iron. "If you can't stop thinking about red meat, there's a chance your body is craving iron, b12 and folic acid," says Lenchewski. "This is especially true during or around that time of the month."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for a healthier burger. "I'm a proponent of grass fed, antibiotic and hormone-free red meat once a week," says Lenchewski. "Try experimenting with an open-faced bison burger—which, cut for cut, is leaner and has more iron than beef." Don't eat meat? Try to incorporate some kind of plant-based iron supplement into your routine, like spirulina. | Sledujte nás na Facebooku<br/><br/>STE ANI<br/><br/>INSIDER<br/><br/>Túžba po cukre? Tu je to, čo sa vám vaše telo snaží povedať<br/><br/>podľa<br/>Byrdie<br/><br/>FOTO:<br/><br/>Jacquemus<br/><br/>Priberanie na váhe z mimo-of-kontrola chute stranou, môže byť frustrujúce mať neustále túži po niečo nezdravé a neviem prečo. Dobrou správou je, že zvyčajne existuje dôvod, ktorý je základom toho, že horiaca túžba umiestniť vrece zemiakových lupienkov, alebo pocit, že by ste mohli skutočne zomrieť, ak nedostanete uhorku hneď (aj keď nie ste tehotná). Ak máte napríklad vízie tyčiniek Mliečnej dráhy, mohlo by to znamenať, že vám chýba veľmi špecifická živina vo vašej strave. (Yup - je to zložitejšie, ako sa hovorí, že čokoládová tyčinka je tak sakramentsky chutná.)<br/><br/>Hovorili sme s Los Angeles-založené dietológ Shira Lenchewski, MS, RD, dostať chudá na niektoré bežné chute, rovnako ako to, čo môžete urobiť, aby nasýtiť hlad bez toho, aby sa cez palubu. Pokračujte rolovanie pre niektoré vážne dobré informácie!<br/><br/>Ak máte chuť na čokoládu<br/><br/>To znamená: Mohlo by vám chýbať horčík vo vašej strave, hovorí Lenchewski. "Magnezium je základným minerálom zapojeným do výroby energie, metabolizmu glukózy a svalovej funkcie. To platí najmä pre tých, ktorí tvrdo udierajú do posilňovne, "vysvetľuje. Navyše, hladiny horčíka počas predmenštruačných týždňov menštruácie znižujú, čo vysvetľuje, prečo PMS tak často prichádza s chuťou na čokoládu.<br/><br/>Namiesto toho hľadajte kvalitnú horkú čokoládu s nízkym obsahom cukru, ktorá má prirodzene vysoký obsah horčíka. "Odporúčam držať sa 75 percent kakaa alebo vyššieho a spárovať ho s iným zdrojom bohatým na horčík, ako sú slnečnicové semená," hovorí Lenchewski. Navrhuje čokoládovú značku Hu, potravinársku spoločnosť s malými dávkami, ktorá sa zameriava na vysokokvalitné ingrediencie vyrábané lokálne. "Je to trochu drahé, ale o dôvod viac, aby ste mali porcie pod kontrolou," hovorí. "Je to môj osobný favorit." Sme tiež veľkí fanúšikovia superfood-balené Zenbunni.<br/><br/>Ak máte chuť na cukríky<br/><br/>To znamená: "Krvácanie čistého cukru je dobrým znamením, že vám dochádza energia," hovorí Lenchewski. "Premýšľajte o tom. Čo je jedna vec, ktorú svietite po hroznom nočnom spánku alebo okolo štvrtej večer počas stresujúceho pracovného dňa? Odpoveďou je zvyčajne cukor, pretože sa používa ako instantné palivo pre bunky nášho tela.<br/><br/>Namiesto toho, siahnuť po jablkách s orechovým maslom. "Ak ste nájazd na cukríky svojich spolupracovníkov, odporúčam pomalšie spaľovanie uhľohydrátov so zdrojom tuku alebo bielkovín," hovorí Lenchewski. Na rozdiel od jednoduchého cukru to bude poháňať vaše bunky a zároveň sa vyhnúť havárii po cukre. Dve možnosti, ktoré robia pre skvelé pick-me-up nabudúce budete túžiť cukroví: nakrájané jablko s výberom orechového masla, alebo bobule s 2% nesladené grécky jogurt. Máme radi, keď sa nám tieto návykové kokosové lupienky tiež páčia - sú naplnené, bez pridaného cukru a jednoducho tak dobré.<br/><br/>Ak máte chuť na soľ<br/><br/>Znamená to: "Ak to neurobí nič iné ako najslanejšia uhorka, nemusíte piť dostatok H2O," hovorí Lenchewski. "Soľ pomáha telu držať sa vody, takže ju túžime, keď potrebujeme tekutiny."<br/><br/>Namiesto toho siahnuť po vode. "Zostaňte hydratované, najmä keď sa blížime letných mesiacoch," hovorí. Nabudúce túžba hity, skúste kalenie (doslova) s niekoľkými osviežujúcimi poháre a môžete nájsť naliehavosť sodíka binge zmizne. "Ak vás nudí obyčajná voda, skúste pridať mätu, citrón alebo mrazené ovocie, aby ste ho zmiešali," hovorí Lenchewski. A ak to stále nefunguje, existuje zdravšia alternatíva k vrecúškam čipsy alebo hranolky. "Ak ste naozaj len túžba soľ po tom všetkom, opekané morské riasy je skvelá nízkokalorická možnosť," hovorí.<br/><br/>Ak máte chuť na škrobové sacharidy ako cestoviny<br/><br/>To znamená: "Pretože potraviny s vysokým obsahom sacharidov zvyšujú hormón serotonínu, chute na škrob môžu byť znamením, že potrebujete posilňovač nálady," hovorí Lenchewski.<br/><br/>Namiesto toho, siahnuť po kúpeli! "Vypáliť Epsom soli, pretože je čas na niektoré vážne R + R," hovorí Lenchewski. "Verte mi. Doprajte si škrob zadarmo-pre-všetko sa cíti naozaj dobre v túto chvíľu, ale to bude pravdepodobne bum vás viac na druhý deň." (Ako každý, kto niekedy prehnal chuť na pizzu alebo cestoviny vie.) Takže nabudúce sa chcete ponoriť do hlavy najprv do misky sacharidov, nakreslite kúpeľ, zapáľte sviečku a doprajte si bez ľútosti alebo hustých kalórií.<br/><br/>Ak máte chuť na zmrzlinu<br/><br/>5 / 6<br/><br/>Znamená to: "Vaše telo vám môže povedať, že potrebuje nejaký zdravý tuk."<br/><br/>Namiesto toho siahnuť po kokosovej zmrzline. "Som realista, takže ak máte chuť na zmrzlinu, nebudem odporúčať hrsť vlašských orechov, ktoré sú samozrejme plné zdravého tuku," hovorí Lenchewski. "Pre núdzové situácie so zmrzlinou odporúčam kokosové zmrzliny s nízkym obsahom cukru, ako je Coconut Bliss alebo Kippyho trojzložková zmrzlina v Los Angeles." Môžeme zaručiť, že kokosová zmrzlina chutí neuveriteľne a rovnako ako skutočná vec.<br/><br/>Ak máte chuť na hamburger<br/><br/>To znamená: Potrebujete železo. "Ak nemôžete prestať myslieť na červené mäso, je tu šanca, že vaše telo túži po železe, b12 a kyseline listovej," hovorí Lenchewski. "To platí najmä počas tohto obdobia mesiaca alebo okolo neho."<br/><br/>Namiesto toho sáhni po zdravšom hamburgeri. "Som zástanca trávy, antibiotika a červeného mäsa bez hormónov raz týždenne," hovorí Lenchewski. "Skúste experimentovať s otvoreným bizónom burgerom, ktorý, rezaný na rez, je štíhlejší a má viac železa ako hovädzie mäso." Nejedzte mäso? Pokúste sa začleniť nejaký doplnok železa na rastlinnej báze do vašej rutiny, ako je spirulina. |

| Web Services, Vendors And Cyber Laws!<br/><br/>Updated On:April 21, 2014Bilal Ahmad<br/><br/>Computerization of this world changed human performance scenario to a great extent and that too beyond measurement. For instance, Now you can send vital information all across the globe with a single mouse click, thanks to internet connectivity. Sadly, it is this wide connectivity and popularity among people, internet has also increased chances for computer crimes. Internet crimes or computer crimes are widely known as 'Cyber Crimes'.<br/><br/>'Cyber Laws' is something new in the judiciary system but has gained a lot of attention lately. The term cyber crime is something very synonymous with conventional crime, the only difference being medium of execution. There are majorly two types of cyber crimes, the first one is in which computers are the main targets and these include cases of data damage, malicious code and even criminal data access. The second one is in which computer is only a tool using which conventional crimes are committed for eg cyber terrorism, spamming, cyber stalking and many more.<br/><br/>This is where a website consultant or a vendor comes into scene. Although not aware of all the cyber laws present till date, a website vendor can advise you on some of the most vital cyber laws while creating your site.<br/><br/>This may include common knowledge of copy rights or even protecting the content of your own website. Explaining you all the rights you posses as a website owner is also one the tasks a website vendor may do while developing your website. A vendor can also assist you by offering you information on different cyber laws to protect data. Besides all of this, a vendor can also offer you information on any new cyber law that you may not be aware of till know. Cyber laws may vary from nation to nation, one recent example can be of the cookie law released in the United Kingdom, which prevents the website from saving any user browsing data. As per the Cookie Law, websites in the United Kingdom cannot save cookie files without informational consent from the surfer.<br/><br/>It is after the implementation of such law, websites now have a pop-up window, which seeks the consent of the visitor for saving cookies files. Such files are used by websites to analyze the browsing pattern of visitors based on which advertisements are then posted on a user window. With hacking not anymore a new thing for all of us, do you think such rules and regulations can prevent online forgery or cyber crime? Technology has developed at a rapid rate but still people do not prefer shopping online due to fear of personal or bank account details getting hacked. With the rise of cyber crime, need of stringent cyber laws have also increased to curb the same and to promote a risk free shopping experience.<br/><br/>Classes of Cyber Crimes<br/><br/>Over the years there have been three major classes of cyber crimes:<br/><br/>Unauthorized access of computer system cases, which involves hacking or stealing usernames and passwords to gain access over personal information of the respective user. These kind of backdoor access are organized with the help of Trojan Horse. Releasing malicious programs like Trojan House, worms or computer viruses etc. The last class includes cyber stalking a user or online harassment .<br/><br/>Direct implications of Cyber crimes<br/><br/>Decrease in sales<br/><br/>Decrease in staff output due to network delays<br/><br/>Loss of personalized information like research work<br/><br/>Disruption in communication process<br/><br/>Indirect implications of Cyber crimes<br/><br/>Credibility issue in our financial system<br/><br/>Brand image is tarnished in the market<br/><br/>Cyber crimes affect business to business relationship in the market<br/><br/>Sense of trust in state policies and government agencies is lost<br/><br/>Preventing Cyber Crime<br/><br/>As netizens there are certain precautions that we should consider for a safe and secure online experience. Here are some of them:<br/><br/>First thing to do will be to keep personal information to your self and avoid sharing the same online.<br/><br/>Avoid sharing any photographs with online chat friends or strangers.<br/><br/>Installing latest version of anti-virus on your system can offer you a good line of defense against internet threats like viruses and malware.<br/><br/>Keeping back up of your valuable data is a good option to avoid problems like virus contamination.<br/><br/>Avoid sending credit card information to sites that are unsecured and don't have any valid certificate.<br/><br/>Installing safety programme that offers you control over site cookies and saves you from being tracked by websites.<br/><br/>Putting host-based intrusions detection devices on servers will help you keep track of irregularities on your website traffic.<br/><br/>Use of firewall is advised.<br/><br/>Why Cyber attacks are so popular?<br/><br/>Cheaper than traditional cheating methods<br/><br/>Tracking cyber crimes are not easy<br/><br/>Exact locations cannot be tracked easily<br/><br/>Absence of physical barrier in the internet world<br/><br/>Cyber crimes affect large number of people<br/><br/>Conclusion<br/><br/>The fact that human mind has unfathomable power is undeniable, which is why internet crimes are increasing at a tremendous rate. Even history has witnessed some of the greatest internet security gone kaput by the hands of hackers, who have easily got away too. The only way to curb such crime is to remain aware of the cyber laws that we have today, that can either be through internet or through website/IT vendors. Information Technology Act has to be balanced in such a way that it proves too stringent for people who are involved in cyber crimes and at the same time it should never hamper the growth of Internet industry.<br/><br/>Author Bio:– Maneet Puri at present is heading a quality web design firm located at New Delhi, India.

Napríklad teraz môžete posielať dôležité informácie po celom svete jediným kliknutím myši vďaka pripojeniu na internet. Je smutné, že je to široká konektivita a popularita medzi ľuďmi, internet má tiež zvýšené šance na počítačové zločiny. Internetové zločiny alebo počítačové zločiny sú všeobecne známe ako "kybernetické zločiny".<br/><br/>"Kybernetické zákony" je niečo nové v súdnictve, ale získal veľa pozornosti v poslednej dobe. Termín kyberzločin je niečo veľmi synonymom konvenčnej trestnej činnosti, jediný rozdiel je prostriedok popravy. Existujú prevažne dva typy kybernetických trestných činov, prvý z nich je, v ktorom sú počítače hlavnými cieľmi a tieto zahŕňajú prípady poškodenia dát, škodlivý kód a dokonca aj prístup k trestným údajom. Druhým je, v ktorom počítač je len nástroj, pomocou ktorého konvenčné trestné činy sú páchané pre napr kybernetický terorizmus, spamming, kybernetické stalking a mnoho ďalších.<br/><br/>To je miesto, kde webové stránky konzultant alebo dodávateľ príde na scénu. Aj keď nie je vedomý všetkých kybernetických zákonov prítomných k dátumu, webové stránky dodávateľ vám môže poradiť na niektoré z najdôležitejších kybernetických zákonov pri vytváraní vášho webu.<br/><br/>To môže zahŕňať všeobecné vedomosti o právach na kopírovanie alebo dokonca ochranu obsahu vašich vlastných webových stránok. Vysvetlenie všetkých práv, ktoré vlastníte ako vlastník webových stránok, je tiež jednou z úloh, ktoré môže dodávateľ webových stránok urobiť pri vývoji vašich webových stránok. Dodávateľ vám môže tiež pomôcť tým, že vám ponúkne informácie o rôznych kybernetických zákonoch na ochranu údajov. Okrem toho vám dodávateľ môže tiež ponúknuť informácie o akomkoľvek novom kybernetickom zákone, o ktorom nemusíte vedieť, kým sa nedozviete. Kybernetické zákony sa môžu v jednotlivých krajinách líšiť, jedným z posledných príkladov môže byť zákon o súboroch cookie vydaný v Spojenom kráľovstve, ktorý zabraňuje tomu, aby webové stránky ukladali údaje o prehliadaní. Podľa zákona o súboroch cookie nemôžu webové stránky v Spojenom kráľovstve ukladať súbory cookie bez informatívneho súhlasu surfera.<br/><br/>Práve po implementácii takéhoto zákona majú webové stránky teraz vyskakovacie okno, ktoré žiada o súhlas návštevníka na ukladanie súborov cookie. Takéto súbory používajú webové stránky na analýzu vzoru prehliadania návštevníkov na základe toho, ktoré reklamy sú potom zverejnené v okne používateľa. S hacking už nie je nová vec pre nás všetkých, myslíte si, že takéto pravidlá a predpisy môžu zabrániť on-line falšovanie alebo počítačovej kriminality? Technológia sa vyvinula rýchlym tempom, ale stále ľudia neuprednostňujú nakupovanie online kvôli obavám z osobných alebo bankových údajov, ktoré sa dostali do hackerov. S nárastom počítačovej kriminality sa zvýšila aj potreba prísnych kybernetických zákonov, aby sa obmedzilo to isté a podporilo nakupovanie bez rizika.<br/><br/>Triedy počítačovej kriminality<br/><br/>V priebehu rokov došlo k trom hlavným triedam počítačovej kriminality:<br/><br/>Neoprávnený prístup k počítačovým systémom, ktorý zahŕňa hackovanie alebo krádež používateľských mien a hesiel, aby ste získali prístup k osobným údajom príslušného používateľa. Tento druh prístupu do zadných vrátok je organizovaný pomocou Trójskeho koňa. Uvoľnenie škodlivé programy ako Trojan dom, červy alebo počítačové vírusy atď Posledná trieda zahŕňa kybernetické prenasledovanie užívateľa alebo on-line obťažovanie.<br/><br/>Priame dôsledky počítačovej kriminality<br/><br/>Zníženie predaja<br/><br/>Zníženie počtu zamestnancov v dôsledku oneskorenia siete<br/><br/>Strata personalizovaných informácií, ako je výskumná práca<br/><br/>Narušenie komunikačného procesu<br/><br/>Nepriame dôsledky počítačovej kriminality<br/><br/>Dôveryhodnosť v našom finančnom systéme<br/><br/>Značka imidž je pošpinený na trhu<br/><br/>Kybernetická kriminalita ovplyvňuje obchodné vzťahy na trhu<br/><br/>Pocit dôvery v štátne politiky a vládne agentúry je stratený<br/><br/>Prevencia počítačovej kriminality<br/><br/>Ako netizens existujú určité opatrenia, ktoré by sme mali zvážiť pre bezpečné a bezpečné on-line skúsenosti.

Jediný spôsob, ako obmedziť takýto zločin, je zostať si vedomý kybernetických zákonov, ktoré máme dnes, ktoré môžu byť buď prostredníctvom internetu alebo prostredníctvom webových stránok / IT dodávateľov. Zákon o informačných technológiách musí byť vyvážený tak, aby sa ukázal ako príliš prísny pre ľudí, ktorí sa podieľajú na kybernetickej trestnej činnosti, a zároveň by nikdy nemal brániť rastu internetového priemyslu.<br/><br/>Autor Bio: Maneet Puri v súčasnosti vedie kvalitnú webovú dizajnérsku firmu so sídlom v New Delhi v Indii.
