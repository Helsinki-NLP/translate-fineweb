In simple terms, the condition is characterized by: one develops a kidney disease and undergoes a kidney transplant and other diseases associated with acidic concentration in the blood and gout. In theory, the condition will occur even if the genetic change is inherited from one parent and sporadically occurs when there is no family history.<br/><br/>Common names of autosomal dominant interstitial kidney disease<br/><br/>The condition has other names as well namely: medullary cystic kidney disease, although this name is not used as much because most people suffering from this condition do not have medullary cysts. It is also referred to as juvenile hyperuricemic nephropathy. The disease tends to affect people of ages 20 to 50. The latter condition as aforementioned occurs in young children, something, which translate to get it from both parents.<br/>Cystic kidney disease is an inherited condition whereby the cysts in the centre of each kidney gradually lose their ability to function properly. Cysts refer to abnormal blisters of fluid in the kidney. The condition further scares the kidney making unable to concentrate the urine and as a result, producing too much urine. Its symptoms include excessive urination, salt cravings, weakness, confusion, bleeding, fatigue, frequent hiccups, low blood pressure, nausea and vomiting, headaches, pale skin, reduced sensation in the hands, weight loss among many others. Other complications include: anemia, ulcers, loss of bone density, infertility and other heart related problems.<br/>Its analysis incorporates blood tests to check for sodium levels and general kidney functions, urine tests to check the levels of concentration and other imbalances, x rays to check for the size of kidneys that may be altered owing to increased urine concentrations, renal biopsy and genetic testing to verify any genetic changes that might have taken place in due time.<br/>While the disease does not have a cut and dry treatment to it, one may focus on controlling measures, which include intake of fluids and salt to supplement the one lost as the disease progresses into latter stages. This also helps reduce dehydration. Other treatments include taking of prescribed medication and diet changes and minimal intakes of foods containing phosphorous and potassium. Further complications may also require one to have a kidney transplant. Basically, this is not a curable disease but rather a manageable once detected in the early stages.<br/><br/>The common yet different factor of Autosomal dominant interstitial kidney disease<br/><br/>Nephronophthisis and medullary cystic kidney disease are mainly grouped together because, in essence, they share the same features but with a slight difference in regards inheritance patterns to the former affecting children and the latter affecting young adults and older age groups. Similar features for both are ADH resistant urine concentration that leads to polyuria and polydipsia, anemia and renal diseases.<br/>The former aforementioned condition is Autosomal recessive accounting to 15% of chronic diseases and causes ESRD during early childhood while the latter is Autosomal dominant with a few sporadic new mutations and causes ESRD for people between the ages of 30 and 50. | Online certifikácie CPR Blog<br/><br/>Dátum: 23. júl 2014<br/><br/>Autozomálne dominantné intersticiálne ochorenie obličiek je zriedkavá zbierka ochorení ovplyvňujúcich známe funkcie obličiek.

| Hobbes' vs. Locke's Account on the State of Nature<br/><br/>Topic: PhilosophyWords: 2539Pages: 9Aug 3rd, 2021<br/><br/>Hobbes and Locke are among the most influential political philosophers to ever write in English. The state of nature, which precedes the organization of the complex societies, is the common premise that both Hobbes and Locke share but interpret in different ways. The former views humans in their natural state as equally dangerous and free to pursue their egoistic goals unrestricted by the nonexistent notions of justice, which is why his natural state amounts to the "war of every man against every man" (Hobbes76). The latter, on the other hand, views humans in their original condition as equally valuable and restricts natural freedom by the idea of justice that requires not to harm others, which allows defining the state of nature as "mutual assistance and preservation" rather than war (Locke 15). The key difference between the two philosophers' accounts of natural state is that Locke uses ethical considerations while Hobbes does not, and it ultimately leads Hobbes to envisage a state exercising unlimited power over human beings, while Locke limits the government by the moral principles, which he considers a natural law.<br/><br/>Hobbes bases his assumptions regarding the state of nature on the fact that all people are roughly equal in their physical and mental capabilities. He admits that some individuals may demonstrate greater physical strength or superior intellect but insists that "when all is reckoned together, the difference between man and man is not so considerable" (Hobbes 74). Since humans are roughly equal in their capabilities, they also have similar hopes to attain their ends and satisfy their needs (Hobbes 75). As a logical outcome of this equality, when the people begin competing for scarce resources, no one may feel entirely secure in his or her possessions. Even if a mighty, cunning, and capable person succeeds in subjugating "the persons of all men he can," it still does not guarantee the ultimate security (Hobbes 75). As no human can obtain such superiority over the others that renders him or her utterly immune to their strength of intellect, no human can feel completely safe when surrounded by his or her equals. Hobbes' equality in the natural state is equality of fear, where all humans view each other as dangerous competitors.<br/><br/>Just as Hobbes, Locke considers all human beings to be fundamentally equal, but assigns a very different meaning to the term. From his perspective, it is not the equality of capabilities, but, rather, the equality of value. He opines that the people "promiscuously born to all the same advantages of nature" should logically enjoy the perfect equality among them, as there is no reason to consider anyone inherently more valuable (Locke 8). The only possible foundation for designating some people as superior to others would be if God "by any manifest declaration of his will, set one above another" (Locke 8). Since such divine sanction of superiority is absent, Locke concludes that the natural equality of all representatives of humankind is not to be called into question. Hobbes approaches equality pragmatically and stresses that people in their natural state are equally dangerous, but Locke employs an ethical approach and emphasizes that humans are equally valuable in God's eyes. This disagreement is but the first difference between the two authors based on the fact that Locke includes God as a premise into his political philosophy, while Hobbes does not.<br/><br/>Another characteristic feature of Hobbes' account of the natural state is his interpretation of liberty. According to Hobbes, the state of nature implies unlimited freedom to do whatever is necessary for one's continued existence. The philosopher defines liberty as "the absence of external impediments" in using one's abilities to attain one's goals (Hobbes 79). The primary purpose of every sentient being is to maintain its continued existence. As a consequence, Hobbesian freedom amounts to the unhindered opportunity to do anything that, in one's judgment, would be best suited to preserve one's life and possessions (Hobbes 79). The only limitation to liberty is that a person cannot do anything contradictory to sustaining his or her life or destroying "the means of preserving the same" (Hobbes 79). Apart from that, there are no boundaries, and everyone has "a right to everything, even to one another's body" if that furthers one's survival (Hobbes 80). Thus, natural liberty, as viewed by Hobbes, is the absence of externally enforced obstacles in pursuing one's right to everything to sustain and secure one's continued existence.<br/><br/>Locke also upholds the idea of natural liberty but, unsurprisingly, approaches it in a manner that is significantly different from that of Hobbes. As soon as he begins discussing liberty in the state of nature, he immediately notes that a state of freedom does not equate "a state of license" (Locke 9). The philosopher identifies two specific limitations to human freedom in the state of nature. The first one is identical to that introduce by Hobbes: however free and independent, a person nevertheless "has not liberty to destroy himself" (Locke 9). Yet the second limitation contradicts Hobbes' prepositions directly. According to Locke, every human being has a natural obligation not to "harm another in his life, health, liberty, or possessions" (9). Just as with his interpretation of equality, the author bases this assertion on ethical and religious grounds: people should preserve each other's existence since they are all creations of the same "omnipotent, and infinitely wise maker" (Locke 9). Thus, Locke's limits liberty in the natural state far more stringently than Hobbes by introducing the obligation to refrain from harming both oneself and the others.<br/><br/>The differences between the two authors also manifest in their accounts of justice in the natural state of humanity. As far as Hobbes is concerned, delineating just and unjust practices is merely the matter of the law. There is no jurisprudence in the state of nature, and the only law governing human beings in their original condition is a natural law that only obliges them to seek personal security. As a result, nothing can be unjust in the original state of the humankind: "notions of right and wrong justice and injustice" have no place and no meaning in the absence of the stringently enforced law (Hobbes 78). As long as the people use their virtually unlimited freedom to ruthlessly compete with each other for resources, to which they are equally entitled, they have no criteria to differentiate between just and unjust actions. Therefore, the Hobbesian state of nature defies the very idea of justice since the author interprets it as a mere function of the formalized and established law.<br/><br/>Locke assigns different meaning to justice and views it not so much in legislative as in the ethical terms. This paper already mentioned that, unlike Hobbes, Locke employs ethical notions and generally bases his political philosophy on moral rather than purely practical presumptions. Locke's natural law, unlike that of Hobbes, obliges human beings to take care of each other rather than simply leaving everyone to fend for themselves. As a result, there is a place for justice and injustice in his state of nature. The author points to this fact himself when noting that no one should deprive another of his or her life of the means of preserving it "unless it be to do justice on an offender" (Locke 9). This statement reveals with the utmost clarity that, according to Locke, there is justice in the state of nature, and, moreover, humans have to preserve it actively. The criterion of justice, which Hobbes' natural state lacks, is the second limitation on natural liberty imposed by Locke: an action is unjust if it constitutes an unwarranted threat to another person's life and possessions.<br/><br/>These differences in the two authors' treatment of equality, liberty, and justice or injustice culminate in their interpretation of the relationship between the state of nature and the state of war. From Hobbes's perspective, the two are synonymous, because the ruthless competition is the only logical outcome of putting people with equivalent capabilities and similar needs in an environment with limited resources. He states this connection outright: "if any two men desire the same thing, which nevertheless they cannot both enjoy, they become enemies" and are, therefore, in the state of war with each other (Hobbes 75). Yet since humans are numerous and all possess similar capabilities and needs, this competition manifests not only in the individual interactions but also on the level of humanity as a whole. As long as all humans have equal and unlimited rights to all resources and even to each other's bodies and lives, the state of nature is a war of "every man against every man" (Hobbes 76). This grim interpretation stems directly from Hobbes' portrayal of the state of nature as governed solely by the individuals' egoistic urges.<br/><br/>Locke, on the other hand, differentiates between the state of nature and the state of war and points out that, while they may occur simultaneously, it is no reason to identify one with the other. Locke's definition of the state of war is virtually identical to that offered by Hobbes. According to Locke, "he who attempts to get another man into his absolute power does thereby put himself into a state of war with him" (14). This explanation lines up perfectly with the Hobbesian notion that everyone's universal right to everything, including the other people's bodies and lives, leads to the state of war. Yet Locke refuses to equate the state of war and the state of nature precisely because he denies Hobbes' interpretation of natural freedom. Since Locke's natural state restrains people from harming each other through the second limitation of liberty, an attempt on another person's freedom is a transgression against the natural law. While for Hobbes, war is the humankind's condition by default, Locke portrays it as a perversion of the state of nature rather than its rule.<br/><br/>These differences in delineating the state on nature and its constituents, such as liberty, equality, justice, and war, pave the way to the authors contrasting portrayals of government. Based on his pessimistic assessment of the state of nature, the author of Leviathan concludes that, under conditions of war, there can be no definite hope for "living out the time which nature ordinarily alloweth men to live" (Hobbes 80). The solution is laying down the universal right to everything and leaving everyone "so much liberty against other men, as he would allow other men against himself" (Hobbes 80). The participants of the resulting social contract invest the unlimited liberties they have surrendered into a sovereign – the bearer of the supreme power whose purpose is to preserve the achieved status quo by punishing all transgressions against it. Sovereign's power is absolute: the ruler has the authority "to do whatsoever he shall think necessary" to promote peace between his subjects so that no one would assail another's life or property (113). Hobbes concludes that without such an unassailable figure entitled with the right to do anything to the subjects, there can be no peace and no guarantee of security.<br/><br/>While Locke agrees with the necessity of creating politically organized societies, he nevertheless opposes Hobbes' idea of the sovereign power as unlimited and unassailable. As mentioned above, Locke's state of nature is not nearly as dreadful as that painted by Hobbes because of the people's obligation to preserve not only themselves but each other as well. Therefore, the need for social contract arises not from the fear of the others, but from the sheer convenience. Small communities may not need numerous laws to solve conflicts and "officers to superintend the process," but larger associations find it advisable to institute governments for that purpose (Locke 57). Yet the power of the government cannot be unlimited because it would result in subduing the subjects to an "inconstant, uncertain, unknown, arbitrary will of another man" (Locke 17). Such a government would constitute a twofold violation of the natural law. By agreeing to another person's absolute power over his life, a subject would violate its first limitation prohibiting to harm oneself. As for the ruler, destroying another person's liberty would constitute direct harm and, as such, be contradictory to the second limitation.<br/><br/>As a direct continuation of his case for unlimited governmental authority, Hobbes denies the separation of powers as a principle. From his perspective, the sovereign, once instituted, possesses "the whole power of prescribing the rules" governing the lives of the subjects or, in shorter terms, the legislative power (Hobbes 114). The sovereign also reserves the right of "hearing and deciding all controversies" – that is, the judicial power (Hobbes 114). Finally, since the entire purpose of the sovereign is to force the subjects to refrain from harming each other, there can be no doubt that executive power is also his or her exclusive prerogative. The separation of powers as a concept is alien to Hobbes because of his views on the state of nature. Creating a political entity where the executive, legislative, and judicial branches would check each other – that is, compete – would mean recreating the Hobbesian state of nature-as-war on a higher level. Since the people enter a social contract and institute a government to put the state of nature behind them, not reinstate it in a different form, the separation of powers contradictory Hobbes' views directly.<br/><br/>Locke, on the other hand, embraces separation of power as a foundational principle of his political theory. His case for the separation is evident in the discussion of the limits of the legislative power. As Locke puts it, it would be hardly advisable "for the same persons, who have the power of making laws, to have also in their hands the power to execute them" (76). The philosopher points to the imperfections of human nature and the inherent desire to "grasp at power" as a rationale for this precautionary measure (Locke 76). Just as in Hobbes' case, Locke's account of the separation of powers stems directly from his interpretation of the state of nature. If there is already justice in the state of nature and the people can understand it, any government is inevitably subject to the same natural law. Since absolute power over people violates both limitations of this law, separating and distributing it is advisable so that the government would function appropriately.<br/><br/>This paper has demonstrated that, while the differences between Hobbes' and Locke's accounts of the natural state of humanity are numerous, they ultimately amount to the presence of absence of moral premises. Hobbes views the natural state as that of unlimited liberty, where people endowed with equal capabilities and not bound by any moral notions, such as justice, compete for the resources unceasingly. Locke, however, interprets equality and liberty ethically rather than practically and opines that war is a perversion of the natural state, as the natural law obliges humans not to harm each other. This disagreement influences the philosophers' approaches to government. Hobbes insists on an all-powerful ruler, as, in the absence of ethical restraints, no other authority could force the humans to refrain from harming each other. Yet, in Locke's view, granting the government unlimited powers would be contradictory to the ethical limitations embedded in the law of nature, which is why he, unlike Hobbes, advocates separation of powers. | Hobbesov vs. Lockov účet o stave prírody<br/><br/>Téma: FilozofiaSlová: 2539Stránky: 9Aug 3rd, 2021<br/><br/>Hobbes a Locke patria medzi najvplyvnejších politických filozofov, ktorí kedy písali v angličtine. Stav prírody, ktorý predchádza organizovaniu zložitých spoločností, je spoločným predpokladom, ktorý Hobbes aj Locke zdieľajú, ale interpretujú rôznymi spôsobmi. Tí prví považujú ľudí vo svojom prirodzenom stave za rovnako nebezpečných a slobodných, aby sledovali svoje egoistické ciele neobmedzené neexistujúcimi predstavami o spravodlivosti, a preto sa jeho prirodzený stav rovná "vojne každého človeka proti každému človeku" (Hobbes76). Ten na druhej strane považuje ľudí v ich pôvodnom stave za rovnako hodnotných a obmedzuje prirodzenú slobodu myšlienkou spravodlivosti, ktorá si vyžaduje, aby neubližovali iným, čo umožňuje definovať stav prírody ako "vzájomnú pomoc a zachovanie" skôr než vojnu (Locke 15). Kľúčovým rozdielom medzi správami oboch filozofov o prirodzenom stave je, že Locke používa etické úvahy, zatiaľ čo Hobbes nie, a nakoniec vedie Hobbesa k predstave, že štát vykonáva neobmedzenú moc nad ľuďmi, zatiaľ čo Locke obmedzuje vládu morálnymi princípmi, ktoré považuje za prirodzený zákon.<br/><br/>Hobbes zakladá svoje predpoklady týkajúce sa stavu prírody na skutočnosti, že všetci ľudia sú zhruba rovní vo svojich fyzických a duševných schopnostiach. Pripúšťa, že niektorí jednotlivci môžu prejavovať väčšiu fyzickú silu alebo vyšší intelekt, ale trvá na tom, že "keď sa všetko počíta spolu, rozdiel medzi človekom a človekom nie je taký značný" (Hobbes 74). Keďže ľudia sú si približne rovní vo svojich schopnostiach, majú tiež podobné nádeje na dosiahnutie svojich cieľov a uspokojenie svojich potrieb (Hobbes 75). Logickým výsledkom tejto rovnosti je, že keď ľudia začnú súťažiť o vzácne zdroje, nikto sa nemusí cítiť úplne bezpečne vo svojom majetku. Aj keď sa mocnému, prefíkanému a schopnému človeku podarí podmaniť si "osoby všetkých ľudí, ktorých môže", stále to nezaručuje konečnú bezpečnosť (Hobbes 75). Keďže žiadny človek nemôže získať takú nadradenosť nad ostatnými, ktorá ho robí úplne imúnnym voči ich sile intelektu, žiadny človek sa nemôže cítiť úplne bezpečne, keď je obklopený svojimi rovnými. Hobbesova rovnosť v prirodzenom stave je rovnosť strachu, kde sa všetci ľudia považujú za nebezpečných konkurentov.<br/><br/>Rovnako ako Hobbes, Locke považuje všetky ľudské bytosti za zásadne rovnaké, ale pripisuje tomuto termínu veľmi odlišný význam. Z jeho pohľadu to nie je rovnosť schopností, ale skôr rovnosť hodnoty. Zastáva názor, že ľudia "promiskuitne zrodení pre všetky rovnaké výhody prírody" by mali logicky mať medzi sebou dokonalú rovnosť, pretože nie je dôvod považovať niekoho za vo svojej podstate hodnotnejšieho (Locke 8). Jediným možným základom pre označenie niektorých ľudí za nadradených iným by bolo, keby Boh "akýmkoľvek zjavným vyhlásením svojej vôle postavil jedného nad druhého" (Locke 8). Keďže takáto božská sankcia nadradenosti chýba, Locke usudzuje, že prirodzená rovnosť všetkých predstaviteľov ľudstva nemá byť spochybňovaná. Hobbes pristupuje k rovnosti pragmaticky a zdôrazňuje, že ľudia v ich prirodzenom stave sú rovnako nebezpeční, ale Locke používa etický prístup a zdôrazňuje, že ľudia sú rovnako cenní v Božích očiach. Táto nezhoda je len prvým rozdielom medzi týmito dvoma autormi založeným na skutočnosti, že Locke zahrnul Boha ako premisu do svojej politickej filozofie, zatiaľ čo Hobbes nie.<br/><br/>Ďalšou charakteristickou črtou Hobbesovho opisu prirodzeného stavu je jeho interpretácia slobody. Podľa Hobbesa stav prírody znamená neobmedzenú slobodu robiť všetko, čo je potrebné pre pokračovanie existencie. Filozof definuje slobodu ako "neprítomnosť vonkajších prekážok" v používaní svojich schopností na dosiahnutie svojich cieľov (Hobbes 79). Primárnym účelom každej vnímajúcej bytosti je zachovať svoju pokračujúcu existenciu. V dôsledku toho Hobbesova sloboda predstavuje neobmedzenú príležitosť urobiť čokoľvek, čo by podľa vlastného úsudku bolo najvhodnejšie na zachovanie života a majetku (Hobbes 79). Jediným obmedzením slobody je, že človek nemôže urobiť nič protirečivé na udržanie svojho života alebo zničenie "prostriedkov na zachovanie toho istého" (Hobbes 79). Okrem toho neexistujú žiadne hranice a každý má "právo na všetko, dokonca aj na svoje telo", ak to podporuje prežitie (Hobbes 80). Takže prirodzená sloboda, ako ju vníma Hobbes, je absencia vonkajších prekážok pri presadzovaní práva na všetko, aby sa udržala a zabezpečila trvalá existencia človeka.<br/><br/>Locke tiež podporuje myšlienku prirodzenej slobody, ale nie je prekvapením, že sa k nej približuje spôsobom, ktorý je výrazne odlišný od Hobbesovho. Akonáhle začne diskutovať o slobode v stave prírody, okamžite poznamenáva, že stav slobody nerovná "stav licencie" (Locke 9). Filozof identifikuje dve špecifické obmedzenia ľudskej slobody v stave prírody. Prvá je identická s tou, ktorú zaviedol Hobbes: akokoľvek slobodná a nezávislá, človek predsa "nemá slobodu zničiť sám seba" (Locke 9). Podľa Locka má každá ľudská bytosť prirodzenú povinnosť "neškodiť druhému vo svojom živote, zdraví, slobode alebo majetku". Rovnako ako jeho interpretácia rovnosti, autor zakladá toto tvrdenie na etických a náboženských dôvodoch: ľudia by si mali zachovať svoju existenciu, pretože sú to všetko výtvory toho istého "všemocného a nekonečne múdreho tvorcu" (Locke 9). Locke obmedzuje slobodu v prirodzenom stave oveľa prísnejšie ako Hobbes zavedením povinnosti zdržať sa poškodenia seba aj ostatných.<br/><br/>Rozdiely medzi týmito dvoma autormi sa prejavujú aj v ich správach o spravodlivosti v prirodzenom stave ľudstva. Pokiaľ ide o Hobbesa, vymedzenie spravodlivých a nespravodlivých praktík je len záležitosťou zákona. V prirodzenom stave neexistuje žiadne právo a jediným zákonom, ktorý riadi ľudské bytosti v ich pôvodnom stave, je prirodzený zákon, ktorý ich zaväzuje len k tomu, aby hľadali osobnú bezpečnosť. V dôsledku toho nič nemôže byť nespravodlivé v pôvodnom stave ľudstva: "poznámky o správnej a nesprávnej spravodlivosti a nespravodlivosti" nemajú miesto a zmysel, ak neexistuje prísne vynútený zákon (Hobbes 78). Pokiaľ ľudia využívajú svoju prakticky neobmedzenú slobodu, aby medzi sebou nemilosrdne súťažili o zdroje, na ktoré majú rovnaký nárok, nemajú žiadne kritériá na rozlišovanie medzi spravodlivými a nespravodlivými činmi. Preto hobbesovský stav prírody odporuje samotnej myšlienke spravodlivosti, pretože autor ju interpretuje ako jednoduchú funkciu formalizovaného a zavedeného práva.<br/><br/>Locke prisudzuje spravodlivosti iný význam a nepozerá sa na ňu ani tak v legislatívnych, ako aj v etických pojmoch. Tento článok už spomenul, že na rozdiel od Hobbesa, Locke používa etické pojmy a vo všeobecnosti zakladá svoju politickú filozofiu na morálnych, a nie čisto praktických domnienkach. Lockov prirodzený zákon, na rozdiel od Hobbesovho, zaväzuje ľudské bytosti, aby sa starali jeden o druhého, namiesto toho, aby jednoducho nechali každého starať sa o seba. V dôsledku toho je v jeho stave prírody miesto pre spravodlivosť a nespravodlivosť. Autor poukazuje na túto skutočnosť sám, keď poznamenáva, že nikto by nemal pripraviť iného o svoj život o prostriedky na jeho zachovanie, "pokiaľ nejde o spravodlivosť voči páchateľovi" (Locke 9). Toto vyhlásenie odhaľuje s maximálnou jasnosťou, že podľa Locka existuje spravodlivosť v stave prírody a navyše ju ľudia musia aktívne chrániť. Kritérium spravodlivosti, ktoré chýba Hobbesovmu prirodzenému stavu, je druhé obmedzenie prirodzenej slobody uložené Lockom: konanie je nespravodlivé, ak predstavuje neoprávnené ohrozenie života a majetku inej osoby.<br/><br/>Tieto rozdiely v zaobchádzaní oboch autorov s rovnosťou, slobodou a spravodlivosťou alebo nespravodlivosťou kulminujú v ich interpretácii vzťahu medzi stavom prírody a vojnovým stavom. Z Hobbesovho pohľadu sú tieto dve synonymá, pretože nemilosrdná konkurencia je jediným logickým výsledkom toho, že ľudia s podobnými schopnosťami a podobnými potrebami žijú v prostredí s obmedzenými zdrojmi. Vyhlasuje otvorene toto spojenie: "Ak dvaja ľudia túžia po tom istom, z čoho sa však nemôžu tešiť obaja, stávajú sa nepriateľmi" a sú teda vo vzájomnom vojnovom stave (Hobbes 75). Ale keďže ľudí je mnoho a všetci majú podobné schopnosti a potreby, táto súťaž sa prejavuje nielen v individuálnych interakciách, ale aj na úrovni ľudstva ako celku. Kým všetci ľudia majú rovnaké a neobmedzené práva na všetky zdroje a dokonca aj na svoje telá a životy, stav prírody je vojna "každý človek proti každému človeku" (Hobbes 76). Táto pochmúrna interpretácia pochádza priamo z Hobbesovho zobrazenia stavu prírody, ktorý je riadený výlučne egoistickými túžbami jednotlivcov.<br/><br/>Locke na druhej strane rozlišuje medzi stavom prírody a vojnovým stavom a poukazuje na to, že hoci sa môžu vyskytnúť súčasne, nie je dôvod identifikovať sa navzájom. Lockeho definícia vojnového stavu je prakticky identická s tou, ktorú ponúka Hobbes. Podľa Lockeho "ten, kto sa pokúša dostať iného človeka do svojej absolútnej moci, sa tým dostáva do stavu vojny s ním" (14). Toto vysvetlenie sa dokonale zhoduje s Hobbesovou predstavou, že všeobecné právo každého na všetko, vrátane tiel a životov iných ľudí, vedie k vojnovému stavu. Napriek tomu Locke odmieta porovnávať stav vojny a stav prírody práve preto, že popiera Hobbesovu interpretáciu prirodzenej slobody. Keďže Lockov prirodzený stav bráni ľuďom navzájom si ubližovať prostredníctvom druhého obmedzenia slobody, pokus o slobodu inej osoby je priestupkom proti prirodzenému zákonu. Zatiaľ čo pre Hobbesa je vojna štandardnou podmienkou ľudstva, Locke ju vykresľuje skôr ako zvrátenie stavu prírody ako jej vlády.<br/><br/>Tieto rozdiely v definovaní štátu o prírode a jej voličoch, ako je sloboda, rovnosť, spravodlivosť a vojna, dláždia cestu autorom kontrastných vyobrazení vlády. Na základe svojho pesimistického hodnotenia stavu prírody autor Leviatan dospel k záveru, že v podmienkach vojny nemôže existovať žiadna definitívna nádej na "žijúci čas, ktorý príroda bežne umožňuje ľuďom žiť" (Hobbes 80). Riešením je stanoviť univerzálne právo na všetko a ponechať každému "takú slobodu proti iným ľuďom, ako by dovolil iným ľuďom proti sebe" (Hobbes 80). Účastníci výslednej spoločenskej zmluvy investujú neobmedzené slobody, ktoré sa vzdali, do suverénneho – nositeľa najvyššej moci, ktorej cieľom je zachovať dosiahnutý status quo trestaním všetkých priestupkov proti nemu. Zvrchovaná moc je absolútna: vládca má právomoc "urobiť všetko, čo považuje za potrebné" na podporu mieru medzi svojimi poddanými, aby nikto nenapadol život alebo majetok iného. Hobbes dospel k záveru, že bez takejto nenapadnuteľnej osoby oprávnenej robiť poddaným čokoľvek, nemôže existovať mier a žiadna záruka bezpečnosti.<br/><br/>Aj keď Locke súhlasí s nevyhnutnosťou vytvorenia politicky organizovaných spoločností, napriek tomu sa stavia proti Hobbesovej myšlienke zvrchovanej moci ako neobmedzenej a nenapadnuteľnej. Ako už bolo spomenuté, Lockov stav prírody nie je ani zďaleka taký hrozný ako ten, ktorý namaľoval Hobbes kvôli povinnosti ľudí zachovať nielen seba, ale aj jeden druhého. Preto potreba spoločenskej zmluvy nevyplýva zo strachu ostatných, ale z čistého pohodlia. Malé spoločenstvá nemusia potrebovať početné zákony na riešenie konfliktov a "úradníci na dohľad nad procesom", ale väčšie združenia považujú za vhodné zriadiť vlády na tento účel (Locke 57). Avšak moc vlády nemôže byť neobmedzená, pretože by viedla k podriadeniu poddaných "nestálej, neistej, neznámej, svojvoľnej vôli iného človeka" (Locke 17). Takáto vláda by predstavovala dvojaké porušenie prirodzeného zákona. Súhlasom s absolútnou mocou iného človeka nad jeho životom by subjekt porušil svoje prvé obmedzenie, ktoré zakazuje ublížiť si. Pokiaľ ide o vládcu, zničenie slobody inej osoby by predstavovalo priamu ujmu a ako také by bolo v rozpore s druhým obmedzením.<br/><br/>Ako priame pokračovanie svojho tvrdenia o neobmedzenej vládnej autorite Hobbes popiera deľbu moci ako princíp. Z jeho pohľadu suverén, keď bol ustanovený, má "celú moc predpisovať pravidlá", ktoré riadia život poddaných alebo, v krátkosti, zákonodarnú moc (Hobbes 114). Suverén si tiež vyhradzuje právo "vypočuť a rozhodnúť všetky spory" - to znamená súdnu moc (Hobbes 114). A nakoniec, keďže jediným cieľom panovníka je prinútiť poddaných, aby sa zdržali vzájomného poškodzovania, niet pochýb o tom, že výkonná moc je tiež jeho výhradnou výsadou. Oddelenie právomocí ako koncept je Hobbesovi cudzie kvôli jeho názorom na stav prírody. Vytvorenie politickej entity, v ktorej by sa výkonná, legislatívna a súdna moc navzájom kontrolovali, to znamená, že by si konkurovali, by znamenalo obnovenie Hobbesovho stavu prírody na vyššej úrovni. Keďže ľudia vstupujú do spoločenskej zmluvy a ustanovujú vládu, aby stav prírody za nimi, a nie ju znovu v inej forme, oddelenie moci protirečí Hobbesovým názorom priamo.<br/><br/>Locke, na druhej strane, prijíma rozdelenie moci ako základný princíp svojej politickej teórie. Jeho argument pre oddelenie je zrejmý v diskusii o obmedzeniach legislatívnej moci. Ako hovorí Locke, sotva by bolo vhodné, "aby tie isté osoby, ktoré majú moc vytvárať zákony, mali v rukách aj moc ich vykonávať" (76). Filozof poukazuje na nedokonalosti ľudskej prirodzenosti a na prirodzenú túžbu "uchopiť sa moci" ako na zdôvodnenie tohto preventívneho opatrenia (Locke 76). Rovnako ako v Hobbesovom prípade, Lockeova správa o rozdelení moci vyplýva priamo z jeho interpretácie stavu prírody. Ak už v prirodzenom stave existuje spravodlivosť a ľudia ju môžu pochopiť, každá vláda nevyhnutne podlieha rovnakému prirodzenému zákonu. Keďže absolútna moc nad ľuďmi porušuje obidve obmedzenia tohto zákona, je vhodné ju oddeliť a rozdeliť, aby vláda správne fungovala.<br/><br/>Tento článok ukázal, že hoci rozdiely medzi Hobbesovými a Lockovými záznamami o prirodzenom stave ľudstva sú početné, v konečnom dôsledku sa rovnajú absencii morálnych predpokladov. Hobbes považuje prirodzený stav za stav neobmedzenej slobody, v ktorom ľudia obdarení rovnakými schopnosťami a neviazaní žiadnymi morálnymi názormi, ako je spravodlivosť, neustále súťažia o zdroje. Locke však interpretuje rovnosť a slobodu skôr eticky ako prakticky a hovorí, že vojna je zvrátením prirodzeného stavu, pretože prirodzený zákon zaväzuje ľudí, aby si navzájom neubližovali. Táto nezhoda ovplyvňuje prístup filozofov k vláde. Hobbes trvá na všemocnom vládcovi, pretože pri absencii etických obmedzení by žiadna iná autorita nemohla nútiť ľudí, aby sa zdržali vzájomného poškodzovania. Napriek tomu by podľa Lockeho udelenie neobmedzených právomocí vláde bolo v rozpore s etickými obmedzeniami zakotvenými v prírodnom zákone, a preto na rozdiel od Hobbesa obhajuje oddelenie právomocí. |
| Fashion Police: What Game of Thrones threw up<br/><br/>Canadian-French singer Abbas Hasan put blinding effort to outshine all of humanity at Fashion Parade 2014. Nothing wrong with that, except safety is priority and the musician is a health hazard here.<br/><br/>We get he wants to be a star. Sadly, he didn't get the memo where they tell the desperate and the infamous that stardom is a metaphor. You don't have to look like one and literally set our sight ablaze. Also, the All Pakistan Aunty Association has officially lodged a complaint against him. The local market has run dry of fake crystals and sequined monstrosities. They have nothing to wear to their biweekly high teas and they claim he is to blame. Apparently, the outfit is inspired by Game of Thrones. Can he please stick to composing sad songs about his neighbour's dead dog instead of conceptualising outfits? Or maybe it's the trauma of losing the dog, whose death he is clearly not over as he is still wearing its carcass.<br/><br/>The charge sheet Outfit<br/><br/>No one can decide where the outfit begins and where Abbas ends. You stare in fascination, sinking into a deep abyss and wonder why he is wearing leather pants. Whose horse did he kill to steal the saddle draped across his shoulders? Was he in prison right before his red carpet appearance and forgot to take off the chains? How will he survive the synthetic leather and post-sequin rash that is bound to be lethal in such high dosage? Why am I still alive?<br/><br/>Idea<br/><br/>His inspiration was seemingly Game of Thrones, but he eventually ended up looking like he was thrown out of a Viking restaurant. Had he come across any of the characters from the show, he would've been slain in the first five seconds of the first episode.<br/><br/>The mental health or lack thereof: Someone get him to a counsellor ASAP! He seems to be under the assumption that wearing a dead dog means that the only friend he had in his life is still alive. Dear Abbas:<br/><br/>1. Denial is not a river in Egypt<br/><br/>2. Your tortured psyche is not helping your music, so get help<br/><br/>3. Try imaginary friends<br/><br/>Bail out!<br/><br/>All of us at the Fashion Police headquarters are severely traumatised. Abbas is someone we did not enjoy arresting. He is currently in custody and attempting revenge by putting on attires from other fantasy shows. He just glitter glued himself in order to look like Edward Cullen from Twilight. As a public service message and to prevent further nervous breakdowns, we gave him the following examples of men from the red carpet of the same event.<br/><br/>Zohaib Hassan<br/><br/>When in doubt, play it safe. The singer looks like your average uncle at a shaadi. A plain black suit with no accessories, even if it's a tad disproportionate, is workable. Zohaib's look is blended into everything and nothing, and when you don't have a fashion sense or the money to hire a stylist, this is okay. It does not carry the risk of cardiac arrest for fellow attendees at an event. Given Abbas' delicate mental condition, this look is what he should aim for. Always and forever.<br/><br/>Ali Zafar<br/><br/>One day, after decades of therapy, Abbas could aspire to wear attire like Ali Zafar's. The dapper summer look is done to near perfection. Ali came really close to looking like a maître d at a French restaurant with his white summer jacket with black lapels, but the shirt saves it, never mind the satin. His pants would have been ridiculous had they not been folded at the ankles. The shoes are what hipster chic happy endings are made of. | Módna polícia: Aká hra o tróny sa vyzvracala<br/><br/>Kanadsko-francúzsky spevák Abbas Hasan dal oslepujúce úsilie zatieniť celé ľudstvo na Fashion Parade 2014. Na tom nie je nič zlé, okrem bezpečnosti je prioritou a hudobník je tu zdravotné riziko.<br/><br/>Dostali sme, že chce byť hviezdou. Bohužiaľ, nedostal poznámku, kde hovoria zúfalý a neslávne, že hviezda je metafora. Nemusíte tak vyzerať a doslova zapáliť náš pohľad. Tiež, All Pakistan Aunty Association oficiálne podala sťažnosť proti nemu. Miestny trh je plný falošných kryštálov a flitrovaných obludností. Nemajú čo nosiť na svoje dvojtýždňové vysoké čaje a tvrdia, že je na vine. Očividne, oblečenie je inšpirované Game of Thrones. Môže sa, prosím, držať komponovania smutných piesní o mŕtvom psovi svojho suseda namiesto konceptualizácie oblečenia? Alebo možno je to trauma zo straty psa, ktorého smrť očividne neskončila, pretože stále nosí jeho mŕtvolu.<br/><br/>Nabíjací list Outfit<br/><br/>Nikto sa nemôže rozhodnúť, kde oblečenie začína a kde končí Abbas. Zízate fascináciou, ponoríte sa do hlbokej priepasti a čudujete sa, prečo má na sebe kožené nohavice. Koho koňa zabil, aby ukradol sedlo prehozené cez ramená? Bol vo väzení tesne pred tým, ako sa objavil na červenom koberci a zabudol si vyzliecť reťaze? Ako prežije syntetickú kožu a vyrážku po sekvoji, ktorá musí byť smrteľná v takej vysokej dávke? Prečo som stále nažive?<br/><br/>Nápad<br/><br/>Jeho inšpiráciou bola zdanlivo Hra o tróny, ale nakoniec to vyzeralo, že bol vyhodený z reštaurácie Viking. Keby narazil na niektorú z postáv zo seriálu, bol by zabitý v prvých piatich sekundách prvej epizódy.<br/><br/>Duševné zdravie alebo jeho nedostatok: Niekto ho dostať do poradcu ASAP! Zdá sa, že je za predpokladu, že nosenie mŕtveho psa znamená, že jediný priateľ, ktorý mal vo svojom živote, je stále nažive. Drahý Abbas:<br/><br/>1. Popieranie nie je rieka v Egypte<br/><br/>2. Vaša mučená psychika nepomáha vašej hudbe, takže získajte pomoc<br/><br/>3. Skúste imaginárnych priateľov<br/><br/>Vykašli sa na to!<br/><br/>Všetci na ústredí Fashion Police sme vážne traumatizovaní. Abbas je niekto, koho sme nebavili zatýkať. V súčasnosti je vo väzbe a pokúša sa pomstiť tým, že sa oblieka z iných fantazijných show. On len trblietky lepil sám, aby vyzeral ako Edward Cullen z Twilight. Ako verejnoprávne posolstvo a aby sa zabránilo ďalšiemu nervovému zrúteniu, dali sme mu nasledujúce príklady mužov z červeného koberca tej istej udalosti.<br/><br/>Zohaib Hassan<br/><br/>Ak máte pochybnosti, hrajte na istotu. Spevák vyzerá ako váš priemerný strýko na shaadi. Obyčajný čierny oblek bez príslušenstva, aj keď je to trochu neprimerané, je funkčný. Zohaibov vzhľad je zmiešaný so všetkým a ničím, a keď nemáte módny zmysel alebo peniaze na prenájom stylistu, je to v poriadku. Nenesie riziko srdcovej zástavy pre spoluúčastníkov na podujatí. Vzhľadom na chúlostivú duševnú kondíciu Abbása, by sa mal zamerať na tento pohľad.<br/><br/>Ali Zafar<br/><br/>Jedného dňa, po desaťročiach terapie, by sa Abbas mohol snažiť nosiť oblečenie ako Ali Zafar. Šikovný letný vzhľad je takmer dokonalý. Ali sa veľmi priblížil k tomu, aby vyzeral ako majster vo francúzskej reštaurácii s jeho bielou letnou bundu s čiernymi klopami, ale košeľa ho šetrí, bez ohľadu na satén. Jeho nohavice by boli smiešne, keby neboli zložené na členky. Topánky sú to, čo hipster chic happy ends sú vyrobené z. |
| Determining soil hydraulic properties with different wetting liquids : A thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the Degree of Master of Science at Lincoln University<br/><br/>Abstract<br/><br/>Soil hydraulic properties such as hydraulic conductivity, water retention and plant water relationships dominate the water movement processes. For example, the infiltration, evaporation and water flow within the soil. As a widespread phenomenon in soil, soil water repellency alters the soil hydraulic functions by resisting the water flow into the soils. Moreover, the hydraulic properties not only depend on the pore system of soil but also are affected by the physicochemical properties of the pore surfaces. Compared to water, ethanol is not affected by the water repellency due to its lower surface tension. The purpose of using ethanol is to eliminate the effect of soil water repellency on hydraulic properties measurements. However, applying pure ethanol into natural soil can degrade the soil organic materials and lead to changes in physical properties. Therefore, the aqueous ethanol solutions can be an alternative option. Nevertheless, the feasibility of using aqueous ethanol for determining soil liquid retention curve remains unknown. This study aims to test the feasibility of the aqueous ethanol solutions (0, 10 %, 20 %, 30 %, 40 %, 50 % and 100 % v/v) for establishing liquid retention curve under a small range of applied pressure in coarse sand samples with different wettability and organic amended natural soil (Templeton silt loam (TSL) with mushroom compost, biochar, dairy effluent, and municipal compost, the application rate was 15 % by weight). The result showed that the desorption of testing aqueous ethanol solutions compared to water was quicker by approximately 1 to 3x based on the liquid content at the same applied pressure and the time for reaching each equilibrium. The outcomes from the sand experiment suggested that when the concentration of aqueous ethanol solution was below 50 %, the losses via evaporation were less than 1% and the relative differences between testing liquid and water was lower than 10 %. However, the evaporation losses were 11.06 % and 24.6 %, and the relative differences were all around 15 % and 30 % in 50 % and 100 % ethanol solution, respectively. In contrast, the organic amendments in Templeton silt loam not only increased the water retention capability but also reduced the evaporation losses. The evaporation losses in TSL soil and TSL with organic amendments soil were with 1 % in solutions with less than 50 % ethanol content. Evaporation losses of 50 % and 100 % ethanol were 2.8 % and 2.9 %, respectively. The relative differences between water and testing liquid were similar to the sand experiment when the testing liquid concentrations were below 50 %. However, the relative differences in 50 % and 100 % ethanol solution were smaller than in the sand sample with around 10 % and 15%, respectively. Additionally, the analysis of relative difference suggested that almost all aqueous ethanol solutions had lower volumetric liquid content at the same supplied pressure compared to water, which was a reflection of the aqueous ethanol solutions desorbed faster than water under equivalent pressure. Therefore, 10 % to 40 % of ethanol solutions could be considered an alternative for determining soil hydraulic properties due to their faster desorption rate and not being affected by soil water repellency. Due to the evaporation and dissolution of organic material, aqueous ethanol solutions above 50% concentration were not suitable for coarse sand or medium-textured soil.... [Show full abstract] | Určenie pôdnych hydraulických vlastností s rôznymi zmáčanými kvapalinami : Diplomová práca predložená v čiastočnom splnení požiadaviek na titul Master of Science na Lincoln University<br/><br/>Abstraktné<br/><br/>Hydraulické vlastnosti pôdy, ako je hydraulická vodivosť, zadržiavanie vody a vzťahy s vodou rastlín, dominujú procesom pohybu vody. Napríklad infiltrácia, odparovanie a prietok vody v pôde. Ako rozšírený jav v pôde, pôdna vodná repelentnosť mení pôdne hydraulické funkcie tým, že odoláva prúdeniu vody do pôdy. Hydraulické vlastnosti navyše nezávisia len od pórovitosti pôdy, ale sú tiež ovplyvnené fyzikálno-chemickými vlastnosťami pórovitých povrchov. V porovnaní s vodou nie je etanol ovplyvnený vodoodpudivosťou kvôli nižšiemu povrchovému napätiu. Účelom použitia etanolu je eliminovať účinok odpudzovania vody v pôde na meranie hydraulických vlastností. Použitie čistého etanolu do prirodzenej pôdy však môže degradovať pôdne organické materiály a viesť k zmenám fyzikálnych vlastností. Preto vodné roztoky etanolu môžu byť alternatívnou možnosťou. Napriek tomu zostáva uskutočniteľnosť použitia vodného etanolu na určenie krivky zadržania kvapalín v pôde neznáma. Cieľom tejto štúdie je otestovať uskutočniteľnosť vodných roztokov etanolu (0, 10 %, 20 %, 30 %, 40 %, 50 % a 100 % v/v) na stanovenie krivky retencie kvapaliny pri malom rozsahu aplikovaného tlaku vo vzorkách hrubého piesku s rôznou zmáčateľnosťou a organicky upravenou prírodnou pôdou (húbna hlinka (TSL) s hubovým kompostom, biošarom, mlieňami a komunným kompostom, aplikačným kompostom, aplikačným kompostom 15 % hmotnosti). Výsledok ukázal, že desorpcia testovania vodných roztokov etanolu v porovnaní s vodou bola rýchlejšia približne 1 až 3x na základe obsahu kvapaliny pri rovnakom aplikovanom tlaku a čase dosiahnutia každej rovnováhy. Výsledky experimentu s pieskom naznačili, že keď bola koncentrácia vodného roztoku etanolu nižšia ako 50 %, straty spôsobené odparovaním boli menšie ako 1 % a relatívne rozdiely medzi testovanou kvapalinou a vodou boli nižšie ako 10 %. Straty z odparovania však predstavovali 11,06 % a 24,6 % a všetky relatívne rozdiely boli okolo 15 % a 30 % v 50 % a 100 % roztoku etanolu. Na rozdiel od toho organické zmeny v bani Templeton nielen zvýšili schopnosť zadržiavať vodu, ale tiež znížili straty odparovania. Straty odparovania v pôde TSL a TSL s organickými zmenami pôdy boli s 1 % v roztokoch s menej ako 50 % obsahom etanolu. Straty odparovania 50 % a 100 % etanolu boli 2,8 % a 2,9 %. Relatívne rozdiely medzi vodou a testovanou kvapalinou boli podobné experimentu s pieskom, keď testovaná koncentrácia kvapaliny bola nižšia ako 50 %. Relatívne rozdiely v 50 % a 100 % roztoku etanolu však boli menšie ako vo vzorke z piesku s približne 10 % a 15 % v uvedenom poradí. Okrem toho analýza relatívneho rozdielu naznačila, že takmer všetky vodné roztoky etanolu mali nižší objemový obsah kvapaliny pri rovnakom dodávanom tlaku v porovnaní s vodou, čo bolo odrazom vodných roztokov etanolu, ktoré sa desorbovali rýchlejšie ako voda pod ekvivalentným tlakom. Preto by sa 10 % až 40 % roztokov etanolu mohlo považovať za alternatívu na stanovenie pôdnych hydraulických vlastností z dôvodu ich rýchlejšej desorpčnej rýchlosti a neovplyvnenia pôdnou vodnou repelenciou. Vzhľadom na odparovanie a rozpúšťanie organického materiálu, vodné roztoky etanolu nad 50% koncentrácie neboli vhodné pre hrubý piesok alebo stredne textúrovanú pôdu.... [Zobraziť úplný abstrakt] |
