| The Masterpiece: a Chain Poetry Challenge<br/><br/>John has been writing poetry since his school days. He was awarded the "Best Poet 2014 and 2021" Hubby Awards.<br/><br/>Madame Monet in a Japanese kimono, 1875<br/><br/>Claude Monet [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>A Brief History of Collaborative, Collective, or Chain Poetry<br/><br/>Collaborative,collective, or chain poetry is an alternative and creative technique for writing poetry by more than one person. The principal aim of this type of poetry is to create poems through the collaboration of various authors/poets, trying to form a unified voice while still maintain their individual voices.<br/><br/>Examples of collaboration abound in Japanese poetry. Though the precise accounts and records of many such events are either lost or missing.<br/><br/>One of the most famous examples of collective poetry writing was the poem collection titled Ralentir Travaux by Surrealist French poets André Breton, Paul Éluard and René Char. These three poets collaborated to write the poems in this collection over just five days in 1930.<br/><br/>During the 1940s, Charles Henri Ford, an American poet, invented what he called the "chain poem", where each poet wrote a line and then sent the poem to another person (to continue) in another part of the world, by post.<br/><br/>In 2007 a collection of American collaborative poetry Saints of Hysteria: A Half-Century of Collaborative American Poetry was edited and published by Denise Duhamel, Maureen Seaton and David Trinidad.<br/><br/>Collaborative poetry writing has been used in schools and colleges to teach students teamwork and to discover ways in which they are connected.(source: Wikipedia)<br/><br/>Study of a Figure Outdoors: Woman with a Parasol, facing left, 1886<br/><br/>Claude Monet [Public domain or Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>The Aim of This Article and How to Approach the Challenge<br/><br/>A few years back I wrote an article called "Poem Without an End" which included a Christmas poem I had written that lent itself to being added to. I was amazed by the response as at that stage I only had a few followers here. People wrote a stanza of poetry each in "comments" on the hub to follow on from the previous commenter's stanza. It worked out very well and at the end I compiled all the contributions into a single poem as part of the hub.<br/><br/>Similar challenges have been issued since, including one by Frank Atanacio called "Spirits Sat as Mourners" that was also very successful. The difference being that in that instance contributors wrote their own hubs for their stanza of poetry and placed a link on Frank's original hub.<br/><br/>For this particular challenge I don't expect everyone to spend valuable time writing separate hubs for one stanza of poetry (unless you really want to). The main problem being that to make it effective you would have to copy the previously written parts of the poem onto your hub and would probably be hit with "duplication" label.<br/><br/>So, that being the case, and also to save having to leave links everywhere, I just ask that anyone who wants to take part just write their stanza here in "comments." Check the last comment before yours that is contributing to the challenge and follow on. If I see more than one following from the same stanza I will use my poetic licence to work them in as I deem best.<br/><br/>At some stage when I feel there has been enough stanzas added I will probably call an end to the challenge and then compile them all together as the completed poem as part of the article (also giving credit to each contributor).<br/><br/>Flowered Riverbank, Argenteuil<br/><br/>Claude Monet [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>The Challenge!<br/><br/>Now comes the interesting part. If you join this chain poetry challenge you have to try to keep the style and voice of the poem as close as possible to the preceding verses, so that to uninformed readers it will appear that only one author has written the entire poem.<br/><br/>Sounds easy, you say? Well maybe it would be if the poem had a traditional style, rhyme or meter. But this one doesn't! The poem you will be adding to was started by an acquaintance of mine Andriealphus as a "chain poem challenge" elsewhere. At the time of writing I was the only other person who had accepted the challenge, and because I loved the subject I thought it would be a great challenge for my fellow writers and decided to use it here and see if the response would be better. (I know of a few poets here whose writing would suit this style)<br/><br/>Rules :<br/><br/>Follow on from the previous stanza in comments<br/><br/>Try to retain the voice and style of the poem<br/><br/>Keep your stanza/verse to approximately the same length as those before<br/><br/>Claude Monet was one of the most famous painters in the history of art and a leading figure in the Impressionist movement.<br/><br/>In 1883 Monet moved to Giverny. Here, he loved to paint outdoors in the gardens that he helped create. The water lilies found in the pond had a particular appeal, and he painted several series of them throughout the rest of his life; the Japanese-style bridge over the pond became the subject of several works, as well.<br/><br/>In 1912 Monet painted a series of 12 waterlily paintings commissioned by the Orangerie des Tuileries, a museum in Paris. He chose to make them on a very large scale, and to serve as a "haven of peaceful meditation." This project consumed much of Monet's later years. Monet once stated, "These landscapes of water and reflection have become an obsession for me. It is beyond my strength as an old man, and yet I want to render what I feel."<br/><br/>His health was now an obstacle, as well. Nearly blind, with both of his eyes seriously affected by cataracts, Monet finally agreed to undergo surgery for the ailment in 1923.<br/><br/>Monet's famous water lilies turned redder as his cataracts progressed. After getting corrective surgery he destroyed most of the "red lily" paintings, angry that no one really mentioned it to him. Ironically, these paintings were probably what made his impressionistic style so famous in that time -- artists started taking more risks with color and such during this point. (source: biography.com)<br/><br/>The Masterpiece<br/><br/>"The boy sitting behind you says you look like a masterpiece.<br/><br/>Ask him, has he ever seen a Monet up close?<br/><br/>Close enough to see nothing but muddled strokes of weedy lakeshore?<br/><br/>Close enough to dip his fingers into the ridges<br/><br/>where oil paints hardened under an artist's gaze?<br/><br/>Close enough to breathe onto the blood lilies?<br/><br/>Ask him, why did he paint them red?" (Andriealphus)<br/><br/>He grinned like Carroll's cheshire cat.<br/><br/>"Through clouded and bloodshot eyes I imagine.<br/><br/>Be my waterlilies!" he says,<br/><br/>"Feel my breath and let my fingers delve,<br/><br/>become my masterpiece instead.<br/><br/>A brush has never touched a canvas as fine as your fair skin.<br/><br/>Let the masters weep in jealousy,<br/><br/>and Van Gogh slice his ear in envy at the beauty of your nakedness."(Jodah)<br/><br/>Self portrait with bandaged ear<br/><br/>Vincent van Gogh [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>Responses<br/><br/>Now it's your turn. Please write your response in the comments below, remembering to check those immediately before yours for the last written stanza of the poem. If you do decide to write a separate hub for your stanza of verse, make sure you leave a link here in comments.<br/><br/>The Finished Masterpiece<br/><br/>All contributions have been received and I have put the finished poem together with only some slight edits. I hope everyone is happy with the result. If you think I could improve the order of stanzas etc, feel free to let me know.<br/><br/>Comments<br/><br/>Hey Diana, looks like I have to go add another stanza to the finished poem :)<br/><br/>Thanks for this contribution.Quite beautiful.<br/><br/>Diana L Pierce from Potter County, Pa. on September 19, 2015:<br/><br/>No tears splash water below,<br/><br/>From the bridge beneath his feet,<br/><br/>Nor can his brush paint his thoughts,<br/><br/>From the mystery maid he seeks.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 21, 2015:<br/><br/>Thank you Cris, I am sure everyone appreciates your comment.

And the beauty we can still enjoy today from all his work.<br/><br/>This is a great challenge! I am really looking forward to adding to this.<br/><br/>I first wanted to stop in and let you know that, up for sure. Shared too.<br/><br/>And thank you so much for all the challenges to help the rest of us, keep our mental energy flowing and giving it a work out! You are the best.<br/><br/>The information about LuLu and the free ISBN number is an answered prayer! So, smile my friend. You are a gift!<br/><br/>Hugs. :-)<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 12, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi again Marj. I think I may have all the verses that are going to come. I have been doing my best to arrange them as I think best with just a little editing. I will probably post the finished poem as a separate hub with a link on this one to it. My book is available on Lulu and iBooks...there's a link on one of the earlier comments. I'd really appreciate it if you were to purhase a copy. Bear in mind it's my first eBook so the formatting etc isn't perfect, but it's taken me seven revisions I think to get it where it is. It will all be easier next time. If you need help let me know.<br/><br/>travmaj from australia on August 12, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi John, you have certainly had some excellent responses to your challenge - I'm sure you'll fuse it altogether beautifully although I imagine a difficult task. I'm interested in your poetry books also - I really have to get my act together technologically - I'll try and check it all out...cheers -<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi Jo, both books 'On the Wings of Eagles" and "I Laughed a Smile" have mostly the same content...except the former has one extra poem. Originally they were in different formats, one ePub, the other PDF but now they are both ePub. They are available through Lulu and iBooks, soon Barnes and Noble and Nook (not Amazon). I may try publishing another book through Amazon soon just to see how it compares. Thanks again.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>John, thanks a lot, the info on publishing with Lulu will be quite useful as I'm thinking of publishing but I'm currently torn between Amazon and Lulu. I wanted to purchase one of your books, but I couldn't seem to find them on Amazon. However, I'll probably get it from Lulu. Wishing you every success, you deserve it.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Hey Phyllis, thanks for ontributing. I like it, a perfect ending to the poem I think.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks Faith.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi Jo, I think I have sorted out the poem satisfactorily. Just waiting to see if there is any more to add. Publishing with Lulu wasn't bad and now that I've done it once it will be easier next time. Getting the formatting to look right in the eBook was the hardest, though you and just type it in a word document and Lulu automatically produces the contents page and converts the document to ePub or PDF you can only use certain fonts and have to make sure the chapter names or poem titles are in Heading 1. They also provide a free ISBN number if you want. Overall it was easier than expected however.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Phyllis, this is succinct and beautiful, I love it. Shyron's did an excellent job also, I thought I'd already commented on her verse, but I hadn't.<br/><br/>Phyllis Doyle Burns from High desert of Nevada. on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Wonderful hub, great idea, Jodah. Here is one from me. Short but sweet. Hope it is okay:<br/><br/>And this the beauty be<br/><br/>From Masters past we see<br/><br/>Impressed upon the boy<br/><br/>Bestowed on her with joy<br/><br/>Faith Reaper from southern USA on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks John and Jo. You are kind. Jo, you have always been a brilliant poet. I, too, am looking forward to the end result after John does his magic to pull it all together.<br/><br/>I will share again to see if there are any more takers.<br/><br/>Blessings<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Faith, beautifully done, I find it incredible how someone with such limited vision can teach us so much about beauty, light and shadows. John, looking forward to reading the end result.<br/><br/>By the way, congtats on publishing your poems. How did you find the process of publishing with Lulu?<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks for your great submission Faith. No it's not too late, I'm still compiling the final poem so it should be up for all to see in a day or two.<br/><br/>Faith Reaper from southern USA on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi John,<br/><br/>I apologize for my late submission here to your wonderful challenge. I am off from work a couple of day and decided to give this a go while my husband is resting from knee surgery. If it does not meet with your standards, please feel free to not use it in your final poem or edit as you deem necessary.<br/><br/>Blessings always<br/><br/>Here it goes:<br/><br/>Confessions to friend Georges Clemenceau<br/><br/>Of light encapsulating both torment, joy<br/><br/>Fervent madness in analyzing colors<br/><br/>Consequential spontaneous creations<br/><br/>Season after season of obsession<br/><br/>Capturing different hues in a single moment<br/><br/>Attentive while strolling in Argenteuill<br/><br/>Brushwork bares masterpiece.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 09, 2015:<br/><br/>Just a shout out to see if anyone else still wants to contribute to this chain poem. I have started compiling the stanzas together but will leave it open for a couple more days in case anyone else is intending to join in. Thanks to all who have contributed.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 02, 2015:<br/><br/>Thank you Genna. It appears Monet is a favourite arist of many here. I hope you'll take part in this challenge too :)<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 02, 2015:<br/><br/>Thank you for a great contribution Shyron. This is a very nice verse. Well done.<br/><br/>Genna East from Massachusetts, USA on August 02, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi John...<br/><br/>I started to read this wonderful challenge (Monet is one of my favorite artists), then came back to finish reading some of the beautiful contributions that give this painting a stunning voice through perception and the senses.

I'm so glad you like my contribution. This is a very good idea, I know you'll have fun putting it all together. Take care and my best to you.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks Deb, yes I am impressed by the standard of submissions. I'm looking forward to putting it all together.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Yes Ann, it is good to see the poets among us take up the challenge with some great contributions so far. I just hope Imcan do it justice when it comes to putting it together.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Well done Jo. The word "sublime" comes to mind. I hoped all the poets would rise to the fore, and they have. Love it, thanks for contributing.<br/><br/>Deb Hirt from Stillwater, OK on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>I am excited to see what you end up with here. There are a number of fine poets rising to the challenge, so go to it!<br/><br/>Ann Carr from SW England on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Great one, Jo!<br/><br/>You've got everyone going, John! Rather you than me, putting all this together, but it's going to be a humdinger of a poem when it finally comes to an end - if it ever does! You've really started something.<br/><br/>Ann<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Ok, John here goes nothing! Following from Kim's. I hope it reads well.<br/><br/>And the boy began to walk away<br/><br/>But in his wake, I heard him say<br/><br/>"I took a trip to Orangerie<br/><br/>Where the ghost of Monet still abides<br/><br/>I sat right down and gazed awhile<br/><br/>Until I heard a soft voice cry.<br/><br/>"Have you ever seen a fluid dream?<br/><br/>Where light evolves into what it touch<br/><br/>Where serenity flows through cloudy veil<br/><br/>Where the magician's brush like lightening rush<br/><br/>Have you ever seen a sight sublime?<br/><br/>A child born of distorted illusion<br/><br/>This flowering pond that traps the light<br/><br/>That lift the heart and beckons the soul<br/><br/>An abstract pulchritude up close<br/><br/>Move back, behold; such tranquil delight."<br/><br/>I hope this is in line with what the others have done. Feel free to edit if needed. My best...<br/><br/>Jo.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Alrighty!<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Yes Jo, please do. Anyone is welcome to do more than one stanza. I may add another myself at some stage.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>John, I've decided to have a go, but it's about 16 lines, can I do it in two stanzas following on from Kim's wonderful submission? You can always edit it later.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on July 31, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi Jo, sorry to hear you are under the weather at the moment. I am not in a hurry to close this challenge so I'll keep it open until you are back firing on all cylinders and are able to contribute. You are one of the hubbers I was looking forward to getting a response from as I thought it would suit. Thank you for your kind words, and get well soon.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on July 31, 2015:<br/><br/>Wow! John I can't believe I almost missed your incredible challenged. This is something in which I would have loved to participate since Claude Monet is one of my all times favourite artist. Unfortunately, I must cry off. I'm a bit under the weather with a head full of cotton wool, or so it seems. If the challenge is still open when I get rid of this pesky flu I may give it a go, but I must say, the standard is exceptionally high. Maj took it to another level but all the submissions are brilliant. Kudos to you Andriealphus and the other writers who participated so far in this artistic and creative masterpiece.<br/><br/>My best always Jo.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on July 31, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi again Maj, glad this poem inspired you, and yes it beats watching the cricket especially with the Aussie batsmen performing badly in this third test. It will be an interesting exercise for me to fuse all the stanzas together but should be good.<br/><br/>travmaj from australia on July 30, 2015:<br/><br/>John, thank you, I'm most happy you like my offering. I found the poem intriguing and suddenly felt inspired to write my version in the same mode. I'm not sure I wrote a continuation from the stanza before (alwaysexploring) but I'm sure you will fuse it altogether when the time comes. Love all the responses. I haven't managed any creative writing for yonks, can't wait now to start over, just need some time. (beats watching the cricket too!!!) Cheers John, will be checking in -<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on July 30, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks for checking Dana. I am pleased with the quality of responses so far. I just have to wait and see how many more come in. The final,poem should be great.<br/><br/>Dana Tate from LOS ANGELES on July 30, 2015:<br/><br/>Just checking in to see how things are going, I can't wait for the finished product.

Bol ocenený "Najlepší básnik 2014 a 2021" Hubby Awards.<br/><br/>Madame Monet v japonskom kimone, 1875<br/><br/>Commons ponúka multimediálne súbory na tému Claude Monet<br/><br/>Stručná história kolaboratívnej, kolektívnej alebo reťazovej poézie<br/><br/>Kolaboratívna, kolektívna alebo reťazová poézia je alternatívna a kreatívna technika písania poézie viac ako jednou osobou. Hlavným cieľom tohto typu poézie je vytvárať básne prostredníctvom spolupráce rôznych autorov/básnikov, snažiac sa vytvoriť jednotný hlas a pritom si zachovať svoje individuálne hlasy.<br/><br/>Príklady spolupráce sú v japonskej poézii hojné. Aj keď presné správy a záznamy o mnohých takýchto udalostiach sú buď stratené alebo chýbajú.<br/><br/>Jedným z najznámejších príkladov kolektívneho písania poézie bola zbierka básní s názvom Ralentir Travaux surrealistických francúzskych básnikov André Breton, Paul Éluard a René Char. Títo traja básnici spolupracovali na písaní básní v tejto zbierke len päť dní v roku 1930.<br/><br/>Počas 40. rokov 20. storočia americký básnik Charles Henri Ford vynašiel to, čo nazval "reťazová báseň", kde každý básnik napísal riadok a potom poslal báseň inej osobe (aby pokračovala) v inej časti sveta poštou.<br/><br/>V roku 2007 vyšla zbierka americkej kolaboratívnej poézie Saints of Hysteria: A Half-Century of Collaborative American Poetry, ktorú vydali Denise Duhamel, Maureen Seaton a David Trinidad.<br/><br/>Kolaboratívne písanie poézie sa používa na školách a vysokých školách na výučbu študentskej tímovej práce a na objavovanie spôsobov, akými sú prepojené.<br/><br/>Štúdia postavy vonku: Žena so slnečníkom, otočená doľava, 1886<br/><br/>Commons ponúka multimediálne súbory na tému Claude Monet<br/><br/>Cieľom tohto článku a ako pristupovať k výzve<br/><br/>Pred niekoľkými rokmi som napísal článok s názvom "Báseň bez konca", ktorý obsahoval vianočnú báseň, ktorú som napísal, že som sa pridal. Bol som ohromený odpoveďou, pretože v tej fáze som tu mal len niekoľko nasledovníkov. Každý z nich napísal strofu poézie v "komentároch", ktoré nasledovali po predchádzajúcej strofe komentátora. Fungovalo to veľmi dobre a na konci som zostavil všetky príspevky do jednej básne ako súčasť rozbočovača.<br/><br/>Podobné výzvy boli vydané od tej doby, vrátane jedného Franka Atanacio s názvom "Spirits Sat as Mourners", ktorý bol tiež veľmi úspešný. Rozdiel je v tom, že v tomto prípade prispievatelia napísali svoje vlastné huby pre svoju strofu poézie a umiestnili odkaz na Frankov pôvodný hub.<br/><br/>Pre túto konkrétnu výzvu neočakávam, že každý strávi drahocenný čas písaním samostatných rozbočovačov pre jednu sloku poézie (pokiaľ to naozaj nechcete). Hlavným problémom je, že aby to bolo efektívne, museli by ste skopírovať predtým napísané časti básne do vášho centra a pravdepodobne by ste boli zasiahnutí štítkom "duplicita".<br/><br/>Takže to je prípad, a tiež ušetriť museli nechať odkazy všade, stačí požiadať, aby každý, kto sa chce zúčastniť len napísať svoju stanza tu v "komentáre." Skontrolujte posledný komentár pred vami, ktorý prispieva k výzve a pokračovať ďalej. Ak uvidím viac ako jedného nasledovníka z tej istej sloky, použijem svoju básnickú licenciu, aby som ich spracoval tak, ako to považujem za najlepšie.<br/><br/>V určitom štádiu, keď mám pocit, že bolo pridané dosť strof, pravdepodobne ukončím túto výzvu a potom ich všetky zostavím ako dokončenú báseň ako súčasť článku (tiež pripisujem zásluhy každému prispievateľovi).<br/><br/>Kvitnúce breh rieky, Argenteuil<br/><br/>Commons ponúka multimediálne súbory na tému Claude Monet<br/><br/>Výzva!<br/><br/>Teraz prichádza tá zaujímavá časť. Ak sa pripojíte k tejto reťazovej básnickej výzve, musíte sa pokúsiť udržať štýl a hlas básne čo najbližšie k predchádzajúcim veršom, aby sa neinformovaným čitateľom zdalo, že celú báseň napísal len jeden autor.<br/><br/>Znie to ľahko, hovoríte? No možno by to bolo, keby báseň mala tradičný štýl, rým alebo meter. Ale toto nie! Báseň, ktorú pridáte, začala moja známa Andriealphus ako "chain poem challenge" inde. V čase písania som bola jedinou osobou, ktorá prijala túto výzvu, a pretože som milovala túto tému, myslela som si, že to bude veľká výzva pre mojich kolegov spisovateľov a rozhodla som sa ju použiť tu a zistiť, či by odpoveď bola lepšia. (Viem o niekoľkých básnikoch, ktorých písanie by vyhovovalo tomuto štýlu.)<br/><br/>Pravidlá :<br/><br/>Nasledovať z predchádzajúcej stanza v komentároch<br/><br/>Pokúste sa zachovať hlas a štýl básne<br/><br/>Udržujte svoju stanza / líniu približne rovnakej dĺžky ako predtým<br/><br/>Claude Monet bol jedným z najznámejších maliarov v dejinách umenia a vedúcou osobnosťou impresionistického hnutia.<br/><br/>V roku 1883 sa Monet presťahoval do Giverny. Tu miloval maľovanie vonku v záhradách, ktoré pomohol vytvoriť. Vodné ľalie nájdené v rybníku mali osobitnú príťažlivosť a namaľoval ich niekoľko sérií po celý zvyšok svojho života; most v japonskom štýle cez rybník sa stal predmetom niekoľkých prác.<br/><br/>V roku 1912 Monet namaľoval sériu 12 leknínových obrazov, ktoré objednalo múzeum Orangerie des Tuileries v Paríži. Rozhodol sa, že ich urobí vo veľmi veľkom meradle a bude slúžiť ako "prístav pokojnej meditácie". Tento projekt spotreboval veľa z Monetových neskorších rokov. Monet raz povedal: "Tieto krajiny vody a reflexie sa pre mňa stali posadnutosťou. Je to mimo mojej sily ako starého muža, a napriek tomu chcem vyjadriť to, čo cítim."<br/><br/>Takmer slepý, s oboma očami vážne postihnutými šedým zákalom, Monet nakoniec súhlasil, že v roku 1923 podstúpi operáciu na ochorenie.<br/><br/>Monetove slávne lekná sa s postupujúcim kataraktom sčervenali. Po vykonaní nápravnej operácie zničil väčšinu obrazov "červenej ľalie", nahnevaný, že mu to nikto skutočne nespomenul. Je iróniou, že tieto obrazy boli pravdepodobne to, čo v tom čase robilo jeho impresionistický štýl tak slávnym - umelci začali počas tohto bodu viac riskovať s farbami.<br/><br/>Majstrovské dielo<br/><br/>Chlapec, ktorý sedí za tebou, hovorí, že vyzeráš ako majstrovské dielo.<br/><br/>Spýtajte sa ho, videl niekedy Moneta zblízka?<br/><br/>Dostatočne blízko, aby ste videli len zmätočné ťahy pobrežia?<br/><br/>Dostatočne blízko, aby sa prsty ponorili do hrebeňov<br/><br/>kde olejové farby vytvrdnuté pod umeleckým pohľadom?<br/><br/>Dostatočne blízko, aby si dýchal na ľalie?<br/><br/>Spýtaj sa ho, prečo ich namaľoval na červeno?“ (Andriealphus)<br/><br/>Zasmial sa ako Carrollova mačka z Cheshire.<br/><br/>Cez zakalené a krvavé oči, ktoré si predstavujem.<br/><br/>Buď mojím vodným leknám!" hovorí,<br/><br/>"Cíť môj dych a nechaj moje prsty ponoriť sa,<br/><br/>Namiesto toho sa staň mojím majstrovským dielom.<br/><br/>Kefa sa nikdy nedotkla plátna tak jemné ako vaša svetlá koža.<br/><br/>Nech majstri plačú v žiarlivosti,<br/><br/>a Van Gogh si v závisti krája ucho nad krásou tvojej nahoty.“ (Jodah)<br/><br/>Autoportrét s obväzom v uchu<br/><br/>Commons ponúka multimediálne súbory na tému Vincent van Gogh<br/><br/>Odpovede<br/><br/>Teraz je rad na vás.

Moja kniha je k dispozícii na Lulu a iBooks ... tam je odkaz na jeden z predchádzajúcich komentárov. Bol by som naozaj ocenil, keby ste mali vymazať kópiu. Majte na pamäti, že je to môj prvý eBook, takže formátovanie atď. Nie je dokonalé, ale trvalo mi sedem revízií, myslím, že to dostanem tam, kde to je. Nabudúce to bude jednoduchšie. Ak potrebujete pomoc, dajte mi vedieť.<br/><br/>travmaj z Austrálie dňa 12. augusta 2015:<br/><br/>Ahoj John, určite ste mali nejaké vynikajúce odpovede na vašu výzvu - som si istý, že ju úplne krásne spojíte, aj keď si predstavujem ťažkú úlohu.

Možno sa pokúsim čoskoro vydať ďalšiu knihu prostredníctvom Amazonu, aby som zistil, ako to porovnáva. Ešte raz vďaka.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues z Lincolnshire, Veľká Británia 11. augusta 2015:<br/><br/>John, vďaka moc, informácie o publikovaní s Lulu bude celkom užitočné, ako som premýšľal o publikovaní, ale ja som v súčasnej dobe roztrhaný medzi Amazon a Lulu.

Len čakám, či je ešte niečo pridať. Publikovanie s Lulu nebolo zlé a teraz, keď som to urobil raz, bude to nabudúce jednoduchšie. Získanie formátovania, aby ste vyzerali správne v elektronickej knihe, bolo najťažšie, aj keď ste a stačí ho zadať do textového dokumentu a Lulu automaticky vytvorí stránku s obsahom a skonvertuje dokument na ePub alebo PDF, môžete použiť len určité písma a musíte sa uistiť, že názvy kapitol alebo názvy básní sú v Nadpise 1.

| First of all EEQT itself needs to be further developed in order to provide a theoretical and computational answer to the needs of modern quantum engineering<br/>and technology. We need to include classical systems with infinite<br/>numbers of degrees of freedom - like electromagnetic and/or gravitational<br/>field. We also need to include infinite quantum systems so as<br/>to understand and simulate Bose gas and its phase transitions. But, there<br/>are also steps that must be taken far beyond the paradigm of EEQT.<br/>As we have emphasized so many times: quantum theory has yet<br/>to be understood in terms of a "non-linear classical theory." But what we mean by a "classical theory" is something much more advanced and more<br/>general than clasical mechanics or classical field theory. By a "classical theory" we mean first of all, a theory that is not based<br/>on probabilities from the start; a theory in which probabilities appear at a<br/>later stage, derived from the theory; derived perhaps, in a necessary way. Such a theory must not only specify the mathematical objects and their relations but also make "predictions".<br/>A classical theory is, in particular, a theory in which discrete events can happen, events that are "objective." They may be events that affect mainly the physical stratum, but they may be also "mental<br/>events," changes of states of "consciousness;" whatever they are, even if they<br/>are concerned with branchings of universes, - they DO HAPPEN.<br/>Such a theory, encompassing the quantum theory as we know it today,<br/>does not yet exist, but we can envisage its possible shape. Nothing serves better than an example, so let us give here an example of how<br/>such a theory can be construed.<br/>Imagine a theory developed a'la Einstein's unified field theory, but<br/>with variable metric signature, possibly with a complex causal web, multiple<br/>Einstein-Rosen [40] (see also [41]) bridges,<br/>time loops, nondifferrentiability, fractal structure, all of that additionally complicated by variable dimensionality of space and of "time" (cf [42]. Imagine such a theory to be able to accomodate all the four fundamental<br/>forces known to us, but it also involves an extra field, which is different<br/>from physical fields, and which is non-local in the sense that it does not<br/>survive taking a macro-average-limit when causal space-time<br/>structure of Einstein's general relativity is recovered. This extra field<br/>would be a place for "thought forms" and our theory would couple these<br/>thought forms to more "physical" levels of reality. The very concept of<br/>"time" would arise only in one particular limiting structure. Nothing<br/>prevents a theory of such a type to have mathematical structures rich enough to accomodate consciousness and mind. Due to its complexity,<br/>density of time-loops, bubble-like causal structure, making predictions<br/>in such theory is possible only by applying probability -<br/>as it is the case with systems evolving according to deterministic<br/>but chaotic dynamics. Quantum wave function would emerge in such a<br/>theory as an effective way of predicting. That type of explanation<br/>of quantum indeterminism was postulated long ago by I. J. Good. In<br/>[3] he speculated that<br/>quantum indeterminism can be understood if we admit that individual quantum events that actually happen here and now have future<br/>advanced causes as well has past retarded causes.<br/>A glimpse of such a thought<br/>may have occured to Alan Turing when he wrote his famous, already quoted sentence: "prediction must be linear, description must be nonlinear."<br/>A theory going partially in this direction is being developed by L. Nottale<br/>[43] who states the observation, attributed to Feynman, that "the typical paths of quantum mechanical particles are continuous non-differentiable." Then he continues his development of fractal<br/>space-time ideas to conclude with: "The quantum behavior becomes, in this theory,<br/>a manifestation of the fractal geometry of space-time, in the same way gravitation is, in Einstein's theory of general (motion-)relativity, a manifestation of the curvature of space-time.<br/>Another step in this direction comes from the work of Russian scientists - which started with the most original ideas of N.A. Kozyrev [44]<br/>and A. Sakharov [45], and is being developed in Moscow, the Urals and Siberia, see e.g. [46, 47, 48]. | V prvom rade je potrebné ďalej rozvíjať samotný EEQT s cieľom poskytnúť teoretickú a výpočtovú odpoveď na potreby moderného kvantového inžinierstva a technológie. Musíme zahrnúť klasické systémy s nekonečným počtom stupňov voľnosti - ako elektromagnetické a / alebo gravitačné pole. Musíme tiež zahrnúť nekonečné kvantové systémy, aby sme pochopili a simulovali Boseho plyn a jeho fázové prechody. Existujú však aj kroky, ktoré sa musia podniknúť ďaleko za paradigmou EEQT.<br/>Ako sme už toľkokrát zdôrazňovali: kvantová teória musí byť ešte pochopená v termínoch "nelineárnej klasickej teórie". Ale to, čo máme na mysli pod "klasickou teóriou", je niečo oveľa pokročilejšie a všeobecnejšie ako klasická mechanika alebo klasická teória poľa. Klasickou teóriou máme na mysli predovšetkým teóriu, ktorá nie je založená na pravdepodobnostiach od začiatku; teóriu, v ktorej sa pravdepodobnosti objavujú v neskoršej fáze, odvodenej z teórie; odvodenej možno nevyhnutným spôsobom. Takáto teória musí nielen špecifikovať matematické objekty a ich vzťahy, ale aj robiť "predpovede".<br/>Klasická teória je najmä teória, v ktorej sa môžu diať diskrétne udalosti, udalosti, ktoré sú "objektívne". Môžu to byť udalosti, ktoré ovplyvňujú hlavne fyzickú vrstvu, ale môžu to byť aj "duševné udalosti", zmeny stavov "vedomia"; čokoľvek sú, aj keď sa týkajú vetvenia vesmírov, STALO SA.<br/>Takáto teória, zahŕňajúca kvantovú teóriu, ako ju poznáme dnes, ešte neexistuje, ale môžeme si predstaviť jej možný tvar. Nič neslúži lepšie ako príklad, takže uveďme príklad, ako môže byť takáto teória interpretovaná.<br/>Predstavte si teóriu, ktorá vyvinula Einsteinovu jednotnú teóriu poľa, ale s variabilným metrickým podpisom, možno s komplexnou kauzálnou sieťou, viacnásobnou<br/>Einstein-Rosen [40] (pozri tiež [41]) mosty, časové slučky, nediferencovateľnosť, fraktálna štruktúra, to všetko dodatočne komplikované premenlivou dimenzionalitou priestoru a "času" (porov. [42]. Predstavte si takú teóriu, ktorá by bola schopná pojať všetky štyri základné sily, ktoré poznáme, ale zahŕňa aj ďalšie pole, ktoré je odlišné od fyzikálnych polí a ktoré je nelokálne v tom zmysle, že neprežije prijatie makro-priemerného limitu, keď sa obnoví kauzálna časopriestorová štruktúra Einsteinovej všeobecnej relativity. Toto extra pole by bolo miestom pre "myšlienkové formy" a naša teória by spojila tieto myšlienkové formy s viac "fyzickými" úrovňami reality.<br/>"Čas" by vznikol len v jednej obmedzujúcej štruktúre. Nič nebráni teórii takého typu, aby mala matematické štruktúry dostatočne bohaté na to, aby vyhovovali vedomiu a mysli. Vzhľadom na svoju zložitosť, hustotu časových slučiek, bublinovú kauzálnu štruktúru je vytváranie predpovedí v takejto teórii možné len použitím pravdepodobnosti -<br/>ako je to v prípade systémov vyvíjajúcich sa podľa deterministickej, ale chaotickej dynamiky. Kvantová vlnová funkcia by sa v takejto teórii objavila ako efektívny spôsob predpovedania. Tento typ vysvetlenia kvantového indeterminizmu bol už dávno postulovaný I. J. Goodom.<br/>Špekuloval, že kvantový indeterminizmus môže byť pochopený, ak pripustíme, že jednotlivé kvantové udalosti, ktoré sa skutočne dejú tu a teraz, majú aj budúce pokročilé príčiny, majú za sebou aj oneskorené príčiny.<br/>Alanovi Turingovi sa mohlo naskytnúť záblesk takejto myšlienky, keď napísal svoju slávnu, už citovanú vetu: "Predikcia musí byť lineárna, opis musí byť nelineárny."<br/>Teóriu, ktorá ide čiastočne týmto smerom, rozvíja L. Nottale.<br/>[43] ktorý uvádza pozorovanie, pripisované Feynmanovi, že "typické cesty kvantových mechanických častíc sú kontinuálne nediferencovateľné." Kvantové správanie sa v tejto teórii stáva prejavom fraktálnej geometrie časopriestoru, rovnako ako gravitácia je v Einsteinovej teórii všeobecnej (pohybovej) relativity prejavom zakrivenia časopriestoru.<br/>Ďalší krok v tomto smere pochádza z práce ruských vedcov - ktorá začala s najoriginálnejšími myšlienkami N. A. Kozyreva [44]<br/>a A. Sacharov [45], a vyvíja sa v Moskve, na Urale a na Sibíri, pozri napr. [46, 47, 48]. |
| Best Nutrition And Exercise For Lose Weight<br/><br/>How is breakfast really healthy?<br/><br/>In the morning like an emperor, at noon like a king, in the evening like a beggar – goes a well-known proverb. A study by the medical organization Endocrine Society confirms the key message behind the saying: It shows that breakfast plays a more important role than is often assumed. In the morning, the human body actually has more than twice as high a metabolic activity as at other times of the day: A large breakfast not only keeps you full for a long time, blood sugar and insulin levels also rise slowly. The appetite for sweets is regulated, we eat snacks less often during the day. Therefore, breakfast should not be skipped even during a diet.<br/><br/>Of course, having a big breakfast doesn't mean that we should have several croissants with nut nougat cream and sweet breakfast pancakes in the morning. Breakfast is healthy best when it is high in protein and fiber, as well as providing vitamins and minerals. Whole grain bread or muesli, oat flakes, fruits and nuts are energy suppliers that are good for you and keep you full for a long time.<br/><br/>The fact that a large breakfast is better than a large dinner does not necessarily mean that breakfast is essential for losing weight. A meta-analysis carried out in 2019 showed, that the total daily energy intake of people who eat breakfast is on average higher, than that of those who do not have breakfast. The latter were on average just under half a kilo lighter. So, according to the results of this major study, you don't necessarily have to eat breakfast if you want to lose weight.<br/><br/>Lose weight with the right diet – that's how easy it is to put healthy on your plate<br/><br/>Eating healthy in no way means less taste. Fresh vegetables, fish or meat as protein sources and other healthy ingredients conjure up taste in the pot and a smile on your lips – ideally also when you step on the scales. A US study has shown that people who cook their own food and consciously deal with what they eat have a body mass index in the normal range. Restaurant visits or fast food, on the other hand, quickly lure you into the sugar trap: Often there is no indication of how much sugar is in salad dressings, how much fat the potatoes were fried in or whether the meat was not treated.<br/><br/>A healthy lunch consists of three parts – the largest part is fruits or vegetables and should cover half of the plate. A quarter of the meal should consist of protein, i.e. fish, meat or tofu. The remaining quarter consists of carbohydrates and is ideally made from whole grain products. Important: Don't eat at your desk in the office, but stimulate your metabolism and ideally take a short walk before or after lunch.<br/><br/>When should you eat to lose weight?<br/><br/>In the evening, you should focus on light meals that are rather low in carbohydrates. These are the least likely to cause insulin to skyrocket, which is good for our body. Vegetables, dairy products and nuts, for example, are well suited for this.<br/><br/>You should also be careful not to have dinner too late. It is best to have eaten until 7 p.m. – then the body can relax and prepare for the night. Sufficient sleep is important for healthy weight loss. A US study found that people who slept about eight hours a night had better fat deposits. So good night! Allow yourself more than six hours of sleep so that you can start the next day fit and refreshed.<br/><br/>Losing weight without exercise – is it really possible?<br/><br/>It would be so easy, if the dream weight could be achieved simply by lowering the calorie intake. But you probably know the wisdom that diet is only one side of the coin and exercise is the other. So nothing helps: Put on your sportswear and off you go!<br/><br/>Anyone who, in addition to the sports program such as jogging, walking or swimming, also lets the elevator go alone and takes the stairs, takes a little detour or uses the bike instead of the car, is doing wellis also called something good. Even simple walking is good for health. | Najlepšie Výživa A Cvičenie Pre Chudnutie<br/><br/>Ako sú raňajky naozaj zdravé?<br/><br/>Ráno ako cisár, na poludnie ako kráľ, večer ako žobrák. Štúdia lekárskej organizácie Endokrinná spoločnosť potvrdzuje kľúčové posolstvo za príslovie: To ukazuje, že raňajky hrá dôležitejšiu úlohu, než sa často predpokladá. V dopoludňajších hodinách má ľudské telo viac ako dvakrát vyššiu metabolickú aktivitu ako v iných časoch dňa: Veľké raňajky vás nielen udržujú plnými po dlhú dobu, hladina cukru v krvi a inzulínu tiež stúpa pomaly. Chuť na sladkosti je regulovaná, jeme občerstvenie menej často počas dňa. Preto by sa raňajky nemali vynechať ani počas diéty.<br/><br/>Samozrejme, mať veľké raňajky neznamená, že by sme mali mať ráno niekoľko croissantov s orechovým nugátovým krémom a sladkými raňajkovými palacinkami. Raňajky sú zdravé najlepšie, keď je vysoký obsah bielkovín a vlákniny, rovnako ako poskytovanie vitamínov a minerálnych látok. Celozrnný chlieb alebo musli, ovsené vločky, ovocie a orechy sú dodávateľmi energie, ktoré sú pre vás dobré a udržať si plnú po dlhú dobu.<br/><br/>Skutočnosť, že veľké raňajky sú lepšie ako veľká večera, nemusí nevyhnutne znamenať, že raňajky sú nevyhnutné na chudnutie. Meta-analýza vykonaná v roku 2019 ukázala, že celkový denný príjem energie ľudí, ktorí raňajkujú, je v priemere vyšší ako u tých, ktorí nemajú raňajky. Tie boli v priemere tesne pod pol kila ľahšie. Takže podľa výsledkov tejto veľkej štúdie nemusíte nevyhnutne jesť raňajky, ak chcete schudnúť.<br/><br/>Schudnúť so správnou stravou - to je to, ako ľahké je dať zdravé na tanieri<br/><br/>Zdravá strava v žiadnom prípade neznamená nižšiu chuť. Čerstvá zelenina, ryby alebo mäso ako zdroje bielkovín a iné zdravé prísady vyvolávajú chuť v hrnci a úsmev na perách – ideálne aj pri stupňoch na váhe. Americká štúdia ukázala, že ľudia, ktorí varia svoje vlastné jedlo a vedome sa zaoberajú tým, čo jedia, majú index telesnej hmotnosti v normálnom rozmedzí. Návštevy reštaurácií alebo rýchle občerstvenie, na druhej strane, vás rýchlo lákajú do cukrovej pasce: Často neexistuje žiadny náznak toho, koľko cukru je v šalátových dresingoch, koľko tuku boli zemiaky vyprážané alebo či mäso nebolo ošetrené.<br/><br/>Zdravý obed sa skladá z troch častí - najväčšia časť je ovocie alebo zelenina a mala by pokrývať polovicu taniera. Štvrtina jedla by mala pozostávať z bielkovín, t.j. rýb, mäsa alebo tofu. Zostávajúca štvrtina sa skladá zo sacharidov a je ideálne vyrobená z celozrnných výrobkov. Dôležité: Nejedzte na stole v kancelárii, ale stimulujte metabolizmus a v ideálnom prípade si spravte krátku prechádzku pred alebo po obede.<br/><br/>Kedy by ste mali jesť, aby ste schudli?<br/><br/>Vo večerných hodinách by ste sa mali zamerať na ľahké jedlá, ktoré sú pomerne nízke v sacharidoch. Tie sú najmenej pravdepodobné, že spôsobia prudký nárast inzulínu, čo je dobré pre naše telo. Napríklad zelenina, mliečne výrobky a orechy sú na to vhodné.<br/><br/>Tiež by ste mali byť opatrní, aby ste nemali večeru príliš neskoro. Najlepšie je jesť až do 19:00 – potom sa telo môže uvoľniť a pripraviť sa na noc. Dostatočný spánok je dôležitý pre zdravé chudnutie. Americká štúdia zistila, že ľudia, ktorí spali asi osem hodín denne, mali lepšie tukové usadeniny. Takže dobrú noc! Doprajte si viac ako šesť hodín spánku, aby ste mohli začať nasledujúci deň fit a osviežený.<br/><br/>Strata hmotnosti bez cvičenia - je to naozaj možné?<br/><br/>Bolo by to tak jednoduché, ak by bolo možné dosiahnuť vysnívanú váhu jednoducho znížením príjmu kalórií. Ale pravdepodobne viete, že strava je len jedna strana mince a cvičenie je druhá. Takže nič nepomôže: Nasaďte si športové oblečenie a choďte!<br/><br/>Každý, kto okrem športového programu, ako je jogging, chôdza alebo plávanie, tiež nechá výťah ísť sám a ide po schodoch, vezme malú obchádzku alebo používa bicykel namiesto auta, robí dobre, je tiež nazývaný niečo dobré. Dokonca aj jednoduchá chôdza je dobrá pre zdravie. |
| Why We Open Sourced the Anvil App Server<br/><br/>Why Open Source?<br/><br/>A little while ago, we open-sourced the Anvil App Server. The community reaction has been great, even a little overwhelming (yes, every reply to that announcement really did land in my inbox!). We've already incorporated a bunch of that feedback into our version 1.2 release. But we keep getting asked, " Why did you open-source such a core part of your product? "<br/><br/>Why do this at all?<br/><br/>Anvil is a tool that makes it as simple as possible to build a web app. We do that by enabling you to build the whole application in one language, Python.<br/><br/>Simple hosting is part of that.<br/><br/>The web platform is broken , and Anvil is our attempt to fix it. And, because there is so much complexity in deploying a web app, a cloud-hosted service was the best way to provide the simplicity we want. That way, you can build your app in the Anvil Editor, and make it live on the Internet with one click.<br/><br/>But we kept hearing from people who said, "that's great, but…"<br/><br/>"…but I need to run this on an offshore platform without reliable internet access"<br/><br/>"…but I want to package my app into an IoT device I sell"<br/><br/>or simply, "…but if I'm putting my eggs in this basket, how can I be sure I can still run my app in ten years' time?"<br/><br/>These are all good points! A cloud service isn't the right solution for everyone. If we want to serve these users, there's got to be some way for them to get their apps out of Anvil and run them locally, under their own complete control.<br/><br/>Open Source: Escape hatch, not an ejector seat<br/><br/>We believe in escape hatches, not ejector seats. At conferences, we sometimes get asked, "can I export this as a Flask+JS app?". Sure, it would be possible – we could generate a server package, compile the client-side Python to Javascript, and spit out a classic web app. But it would have serious drawbacks, because:<br/><br/>Not a comfy ride.<br/><br/>Code generation is an ejector seat. Generated code is better than nothing – at least you can edit it! But the moment you edit that code, you lose all the benefits of the system that generated it. If you're using Anvil because of its drag-and-drop editor and Python in the browser, why should our locally-hosted users have to use vim and Javascript?<br/><br/>So we did it the right way: we open-sourced Anvil's runtime engine. It's the same code that serves your app in our hosted service, and it represents your app the same way. You can edit your code with a text editor, run it, then git push it back into our online IDE. It's not an ejector seat: there's no explosive transition. It's an escape hatch: you can climb out, and climb right back in.<br/><br/>What about our business model?<br/><br/>Anvil was never meant to be one of those enterprise low-code systems that charge you $20/mo for each person who uses your app. Anvil is a developer tool. The apps you develop are yours. Enabling you to run them on a Raspberry Pi is cool, but it doesn't change our business model.<br/><br/>We're doing what we always were: We make and sell a development tool that makes it drastically simpler to build web applications. We provide hosting for Anvil apps. We offer the entire development-and-hosting platform on-site for enterprise customers. And, of course, we offer a free plan so that everyone can use Anvil for hobby or educational purposes – or to start building something and see how it goes.<br/><br/>We've open-sourced the Anvil App Server for the (relatively small) number of people who need it, and to provide the ultimate insurance policy. Sure, you can build an app with vim and host it yourself, without even registering an account with us (we've got docs to show you how!). But the Anvil Editor is the world's easiest way to build a web app, and our hosted service is the easiest way to deploy it – so that's what we expect most of our users to continue doing. And you can build with confidence, knowing that the open-source code is right there if you need it.<br/><br/>Try it yourself<br/><br/>If our development philosophy resonates with you, why not try Anvil yourself? | Prečo sme otvorili server aplikácií Anvil<br/><br/>Prečo open source?<br/><br/>Pred chvíľou sme open-source Anvil App Server. Reakcia komunity bola skvelá, dokonca trochu ohromujúca (áno, každá odpoveď na toto oznámenie naozaj pristála v mojej schránke!). Už sme začlenili veľa tejto spätnej väzby do našej verzie 1.2 vydania. Ale stále sa nás pýtajú, "Prečo ste otvorili takú základnú časť vášho produktu?"<br/><br/>Prečo to vôbec robíš?<br/><br/>Anvil je nástroj, ktorý umožňuje čo najjednoduchšie vytvoriť webovú aplikáciu. Robíme to tak, že vám umožníme vytvoriť celú aplikáciu v jednom jazyku, Python.<br/><br/>Jednoduchý hosting je toho súčasťou.<br/><br/>Webová platforma je rozbitá a Anvil je naším pokusom o jej opravu. A pretože pri nasadzovaní webovej aplikácie je toľko zložitosti, cloudová služba bola najlepším spôsobom, ako poskytnúť jednoduchosť, ktorú chceme. Týmto spôsobom môžete vytvoriť svoju aplikáciu v Anvil Editor, a to žiť na internete s jedným kliknutím.<br/><br/>Ale stále sme počúvali od ľudí, ktorí hovorili: "To je skvelé, ale..."<br/><br/>"...ale musím to spustiť na offshore platforme bez spoľahlivého prístupu k internetu"<br/><br/>"...ale chcem zabaliť svoju aplikáciu do zariadenia IoT, ktoré predávam"<br/><br/>alebo jednoducho, "...ale ak dávam svoje vajcia do tohto košíka, ako si môžem byť istý, že stále môžem spustiť svoju aplikáciu za desať rokov?"<br/><br/>To všetko sú dobré body! Cloudová služba nie je tým správnym riešením pre každého. Ak chceme slúžiť týmto používateľom, musí existovať nejaký spôsob, ako dostať svoje aplikácie z Anvilu a spustiť ich lokálne, pod ich úplnou kontrolou.<br/><br/>Open Source: Únikový poklop, nie vyhadzovacie sedadlo<br/><br/>Veríme v únikové poklopy, nie vyhadzovacie sedadlá. Na konferenciách sa nás niekedy pýtajú: "Môžem to exportovať ako aplikáciu Flask + JS?". Iste, bolo by to možné – mohli by sme vygenerovať serverový balík, skompilovať Python na strane klienta do Javascriptu a vypľuť klasickú webovú aplikáciu. Ale malo by to vážne nevýhody, pretože:<br/><br/>Nie je to pohodlná jazda.<br/><br/>Generovanie kódu je vyhadzovacie sedadlo. Generovaný kód je lepší ako nič – aspoň ho môžete upraviť! Ale v okamihu, keď tento kód upravíte, stratíte všetky výhody systému, ktorý ho vytvoril. Ak používate Anvil kvôli jeho drag-and-drop editoru a Pythonu v prehliadači, prečo by naši lokálne hosťovaní používatelia mali používať vim a Javascript?<br/><br/>Takže sme to urobili správne: sme open-source Anvil runtime engine. Je to rovnaký kód, ktorý slúži vašej aplikácii v našej hosťovanej službe, a predstavuje vašu aplikáciu rovnakým spôsobom. Môžete upraviť svoj kód pomocou textového editora, spustiť ho a potom ho git tlačiť späť do nášho online IDE. Nie je to vyhadzovacie sedadlo: neexistuje žiadny výbušný prechod. Je to únikový poklop: môžete vyliezť von a vyliezť späť.<br/><br/>A čo náš obchodný model?<br/><br/>Anvil nikdy nemal byť jedným z tých podnikových systémov s nízkym kódom, ktoré vám účtujú 20 dolárov / mesiac za každú osobu, ktorá používa vašu aplikáciu. Anvil je vývojársky nástroj. Aplikácie, ktoré vyvíjate, sú vaše. Umožniť vám spustiť ich na Raspberry Pi je v pohode, ale to nemení náš obchodný model.<br/><br/>Robíme to, čo sme vždy robili: Vyrábame a predávame vývojový nástroj, ktorý výrazne zjednodušuje vytváranie webových aplikácií. Poskytujeme hosting pre aplikácie Anvil. Ponúkame celú vývojovú a hostiteľskú platformu na mieste pre podnikových zákazníkov. A samozrejme ponúkame bezplatný plán, aby každý mohol používať Anvil na hobby alebo vzdelávacie účely - alebo začať budovať niečo a vidieť, ako to ide.<br/><br/>Sme open-source Anvil App Server pre (relatívne malý) počet ľudí, ktorí to potrebujú, a poskytnúť konečnú poistnú zmluvu. Iste, môžete vytvoriť aplikáciu s vim a hosťovať ju sami, bez toho, aby ste si u nás zaregistrovali účet (máme dokumenty, ktoré vám ukážu, ako!). Ale Anvil Editor je najjednoduchší spôsob, ako vytvoriť webovú aplikáciu na svete, a naša hosťovaná služba je najjednoduchší spôsob, ako ju nasadiť - takže to je to, čo očakávame, že väčšina našich používateľov bude pokračovať. A môžete stavať s dôverou, s vedomím, že open-source kód je tu, ak ho potrebujete.<br/><br/>Skúste to sami<br/><br/>Ak s vami rezonuje naša filozofia vývoja, prečo to nevyskúšať sami? |
