| Bacopa<br/><br/>19 Nov 2015<br/>Posted by Doxiderol<br/><br/>Bacopa is a perennial plant that thrives in marshy subtropical and tropical regions around the globe. The highly regarded herb is a key ingredient in Doxiderol, a nutritional supplement that enhances cognitive function. Bacopa was chosen for its ability to protect the brain and increase acetylcholine, a biochemical messenger that enables the nervous system to relay information.<br/><br/>Ayurvedic practitioners first described the therapeutic properties of bacopa in 300 BC. The physicians recorded bacopa's abilities to enhance intelligence and memory. Nearly 2,500 years later, a growing body of modern research confirms the cognitive benefits of bacopa recorded in the Ayurvedic text.<br/><br/>In 1987, researchers in India evaluated the effects of bacopa on the intellectual function of school-aged children. During the four-week study, they administered bacopa to 40 children who were 6 to 8 years old. The scientists determined that bacopa increased perception and memory. The children were able to solve maze exercises quicker and more accurately after receiving bacopa. Many parents in India routinely use bacopa to enhance their children's intellectual development.<br/><br/>A 12-week study published in the August 2001 issue of Psychopharmacology investigated the effects of bacopa on cognitive function. Scientists randomly assigned the healthy volunteers, aged 18 to 65, to receive bacopa or an inactive substance. They also used a double-blind configuration for the study to conceal the identities of the products. Researchers use this design to ensure that the test results are valid because it eliminates bias by the researchers and participants. The bacopa group experienced a significant improvement in the speed at which they were able to process visual information. The participants also learned faster and stored new memories more efficiently.<br/><br/>In 2007, a Texas A&M College of Medicine laboratory study revealed one of the mechanisms responsible for bacopa's ability to promote brain health. According to the scientists, bacopa uses polyphenols to prevent oxidative stress and the damage that it causes to healthy brain cells. Bacopa also reduces harmful deposits of a substance known as beta-amyloid, which is the primary component of the plaque in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease.<br/><br/>A double-blind study published in the July 2008 issue of the Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine evaluated the effect of bacopa on elderly patients. The study confirmed that bacopa increased cognitive performance while reducing stress. According to the authors, the benefits achieved in this study confirmed the results of earlier research.<br/><br/>A 90-day study published in the December 2008 issue of Phytotherapy Research confirms the cognitive benefits that were previously demonstrated in other bacopa studies. Bacopa significantly improved the ability of the participants to temporarily store and use information required for completing a complex task. The double-blind study also demonstrated that bacopa reduced the time required to process visual information.<br/><br/>In addition to enhancing nerve signal transmission, the scientists theorize that bacopa increases cognitive function by reducing anxiety. Numerous studies indicate that anxiety interferes with the ability to perform tasks that require higher-level cognitive functions, such as learning and memorization. Stress disrupts biochemical messengers and healthy nerve signal transmission. Bacopa alleviates stress and restores a sense of calm by increasing acetylcholine levels, which reduces your heart rate and enables you to take deeper breaths.<br/><br/>Doxiderol is a great way to obtain the benefits of bacopa. This holistic supplement also contains other natural ingredients that promote brain health and support your ability to focus and concentrate on complex task as well as memorize information. | Bacopa<br/><br/>19 novembra 2015<br/>Uverejnil používateľ Doxiderol<br/><br/>Bacopa je vytrvalá rastlina, ktorá sa darí v bažinatých subtropických a tropických oblastiach po celom svete. Vysoko uznávaná bylina je kľúčovou zložkou Doxiderolu, výživového doplnku, ktorý zvyšuje kognitívne funkcie. Bacopa bola zvolená pre svoju schopnosť chrániť mozog a zvýšiť acetylcholín, biochemický posol, ktorý umožňuje nervovému systému prenášať informácie.<br/><br/>Ajurvédske praktizujúci prvýkrát opísal terapeutické vlastnosti Bacopa v 300 pred naším letopočtom. Lekári zaznamenali Bacopa schopnosti zvýšiť inteligenciu a pamäť. Takmer o 2500 rokov neskôr, rastúci počet moderných výskumov potvrdzuje kognitívne výhody bacopy zaznamenané v ajurvédskom texte.<br/><br/>V roku 1987 výskumníci v Indii hodnotili účinky bacopy na intelektuálnu funkciu detí v školskom veku. Počas štvortýždňovej štúdie podávali bacopu 40 deťom vo veku 6 až 8 rokov. Vedci zistili, že bacopa zvyšuje vnímanie a pamäť. Deti boli schopné riešiť bludisko cvičenia rýchlejšie a presnejšie po prijatí bacopa. Mnohí rodičia v Indii bežne používajú Bacopa na zlepšenie intelektuálneho vývoja svojich detí.<br/><br/>12-týždňová štúdia publikovaná v auguste 2001 vydanie Psychopharmacology skúmal účinky Bacopa na kognitívne funkcie. Vedci náhodne pridelili zdravých dobrovoľníkov vo veku 18 až 65 rokov, aby dostávali Bacopa alebo neaktívne látky. Použili tiež dvojito zaslepenú konfiguráciu pre štúdiu na skrytie identít produktov. Výskumníci používajú tento dizajn na zabezpečenie toho, aby výsledky testov boli platné, pretože eliminuje zaujatosť výskumníkov a účastníkov. Skupina bacopa zaznamenala výrazné zlepšenie v rýchlosti, s akou bola schopná spracovať vizuálne informácie. Účastníci sa tiež učili rýchlejšie a efektívnejšie ukladali nové spomienky.<br/><br/>V roku 2007 laboratórna štúdia Texas A & M College of Medicine odhalila jeden z mechanizmov zodpovedných za schopnosť Bacopa podporovať zdravie mozgu. Bacopa používa polyfenoly na prevenciu oxidačného stresu a poškodenia, ktoré spôsobuje zdravým mozgovým bunkám. Bacopa tiež znižuje škodlivé usadeniny látky známej ako beta-amyloid, ktorá je hlavnou zložkou plaku v mozgu pacientov s Alzheimerovou chorobou.<br/><br/>Dvojito zaslepená štúdia uverejnená v júli 2008 v časopise Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine hodnotila účinok bacopy na starších pacientov. Štúdia potvrdila, že bacopa zvýšila kognitívnu výkonnosť a zároveň znížila stres. Podľa autorov, prínosy dosiahnuté v tejto štúdii potvrdili výsledky predchádzajúceho výskumu.<br/><br/>90-dňová štúdia publikovaná v decembri 2008 v časopise Phytotherapy Research potvrdzuje kognitívne výhody, ktoré boli predtým preukázané v iných štúdiách Bacopa. Bacopa výrazne zlepšila schopnosť účastníkov dočasne ukladať a používať informácie potrebné na dokončenie komplexnej úlohy. Dvojito zaslepená štúdia tiež preukázala, že Bacopa skrátila čas potrebný na spracovanie vizuálnych informácií.<br/><br/>Okrem zvýšenia prenosu nervového signálu vedci predpokladajú, že Bacopa zvyšuje kognitívne funkcie znížením úzkosti. Početné štúdie naznačujú, že úzkosť narúša schopnosť vykonávať úlohy, ktoré vyžadujú kognitívne funkcie vyššej úrovne, ako je učenie a zapamätanie. Stres narúša biochemických poslov a zdravý prenos nervového signálu. Bacopa zmierňuje stres a obnovuje pocit pokoja zvýšením hladiny acetylcholínu, čo znižuje srdcovú frekvenciu a umožňuje vám hlbšie dýchať.<br/><br/>Doxiderol je skvelý spôsob, ako získať výhody bacopa. Tento holistický doplnok obsahuje aj ďalšie prírodné zložky, ktoré podporujú zdravie mozgu a podporujú vašu schopnosť sústrediť sa a sústrediť sa na komplexnú úlohu, ako aj zapamätať si informácie. |

She can also sense demonic auras as well as evil auras. When she was born and growing, however, her powers were sealed and she was much less powerful. Since the defeat of the one sealing her powers, Kagome has reached her full potential.<br/><br/>PURIFICATION By making a physical connection, Kagome has the ability to purify both poison and darkness from a subject (living and inanimate). To do so, she projects her spiritual powers through her hand.<br/><br/>SPIRITUAL BARRIERS With her full potential, Kagome has the ability to create a barrier around herself and expand it around others. It is a dome-shaped barrier that can destroy weak demons that make contact with the barrier.<br/><br/>IMPROVED EYESIGHT<br/>Kagome has the ability to see things that are often invisible to the human eye: ghosts, spirits, divine and evil auras.<br/><br/>ABILITIES WITH WEAPONS<br/>Kagome has the ability to use a bow and arrow. She has been self trained, and after years of practice, her arrow rarely misses its mark. Alongside this, Kagome has the ability to infuse her arrows with powers. She can infuse an arrows with her spiritual powers which allows them to penetrate demonic forces, destroy spells, and purify objects. She can infuse her bow with her powers and deflect enemy attacks. She has the ability to infuse her arrows with purifying energy to purify poison as well as powerful, long distant demonic attacks. And, finally, she has the ability to bypass others with her arrow: If her target happens to be behind a barrier or a hostage, the arrow can teleport and hit only her target<br/><br/>The rest of her abilities have become rather unimportant as they are related to time travel (through the Bone Eater's Well), the Shikon Jewel, or her previous incarnation.<br/><br/>the canon<br/><br/>Kagome has been pulled a few days after her high school graduation, however, before the Bone Eater's Well has opened again to allow her to return to the past permanently.<br/><br/>freestyle<br/><br/>memories<br/><br/>かごめ<br/><br/>The sound of her name was a soft whisper in the back of her mind, like a call muffled by the wind. It was the sound of a distant memory, a voice that she had started to forget but desperately clung to all the same. It was her mother's voice, twisted in the sorrow of her lost daughter. Afterall, Kagome banished without a trace. She vividly remembered those moments, the way the day had begun, what she had for breakfast and the last thing she had said to her mother. It was haunting, those memories, because it was like any other time she had slipped between worlds. She had woken, listless, because she had no purpose outside of school. She could find a job, and was scheduled for an interview that day. Her heart hadn't been in it, but it was what she needed to do.<br/><br/>She remembered the feeling of dread, sucking it up and giving herself a pep talk that she could do this. That she could progress in the life that she was meant to now that things had been settled in the past. Of course, she had the lingering feeling that she no longer belonged in her own time or her own life. Not with everything that she had left behind.<br/><br/>Kagome remembered the feeling of the wood beneath her fingers, the way her hand had curled into the handle to slide the door open. She remembered that she paused, turning to her mother with a bright and vibrant smile as she shook herself from her stupor. "I'm taking off." She remembered how strong her voice sounded, the smile on her mother's lips as her eyes shone with pride. Her mother bade her farewell, which didn't seem any different than before but somehow the weight of the words settled in heavier on Kagome's shoulders the more she reflected.<br/><br/>Briefly, the thoughts flickered forward, wondering if her mother worried over her, missed her like she did. Kagome could openly admit that her mother's strength, her support for the fact that her daughter slipped through time so frequently. There were times when she thought herself weak for not having the woman to lean on.<br/><br/>However, she remembered that she did muster up a meager amount of strength.She could remember the shift in the air, the temperature notably different than what she had expected, blinking at the sudden and unfamiliar surroundings. It was not her family's shrine. And when she turned to go back, to slip through the door she had come through, she was met with unfamiliar and cold metal beneath her fingertips and an interior that was not the entrance of her house. A man stood before her, behind a counter, who stared at her with eyes as wide as her own.<br/><br/>She didn't panic, at least. Being torn through time and placed in impossible situations at least built your willpower as far as strange happenings went. Because it wasn't every day that someone found themselves dragged into the past by a demon, intent on ripping a powerful jewel from their body that they didn't even know was there. And then there was the fact that she had shattered said powerful jewel into who knows how many pieces and was tasked on finding them. Such things were not normal, and she had needed to square up and roll with it once she realized that was her reality. It had seemed so simple, just gather the shards and fix the jewel.<br/><br/>But it hadn't been easy, there were many demons after the shards and the jewel itself. And one particularly powerful demon with a wish that he was determined to see fulfilled. To this day, she had never learned his wish but knew it had never been granted even once he had the blasted thing completed. He had ruined so many lives for the sake of nothing. Ruined so many lives for such a futile task. Naraku had been the most difficult foe, and the one who had been the center of everything that had gone wrong in all of her friend's lives.<br/><br/>But, it was that unpredicability, that necessity to roll with what was happening and the willpower that she had gained from her adventure that she remembered drawing upon to come up with a story that fit in the moment that didn't seem too whimsical or far fetched. She needed to be believed, she needed to survive.<br/><br/>Afterall, she faced worse than a man in a camera store. She had lied through her teeth to save her life before.<br/><br/>"I was looking for a job." In the end, it wasn't a complete lie. After all, she had set out of her house with the intent of attending a job interview. Her state of dress would at least attest to that much. It was one of the easier fibs she had ever told.<br/><br/>And, for some reason, that crazy man hired her.<br/><br/>かごめ<br/><br/>Kagomed rolled over in her bed as she pushed back the distant memories, refusing to acknowledge that she was really awake. She clawed at the last glimpses of sleep, begging it to return and to take her back into its embrace. She closed her eyes, willing sleep to come and was only met with memories. The echoes of a song sang in the distance of her memories, a song that had often tormented her, given the same name as her. The voice that sang was no longer reminiscent of her mother, but the voices of children who she had often played with growing up. They called back the memories, even though it had been years since she started this live, even though she was happy in this life, the call of these memories was too loud.<br/><br/>Suddenly, she was falling back into them and sleep evaded her again. She was watching herself in her family's embrace while Inuyasha was pulled back into the well, looking as startled as she had felt. The memories of that moment, those feelings, were still so strong. The feeling of heartbreak and sorrow welled up again though it had been so long since she had felt like she had been ripped away from everything that mattered to her.<br/><br/>Of course her family mattered, and she was happy to be in their arms again. She could never fully, truly describe how she had felt in those days. She still couldn't explain the way she felt split in two, with warring desires to be in both her past and present. She remembered the futile attempts to jump through the well, fingers clawing at the ground in a desperate plea to let her return. The first month home, she didn't sleep so much as she cried.<br/><br/>Elysion had garnished a similar reaction, though it was not so fierce because she didn't know exactly where she had slipped through nor did she know where she could worm her way back. Her explorations were subtle between working her job and trying to settle herself into this life. She had no intentions of staying, no intentions of lingering longer than she needed. And while she didn't try as fiercely as she had when she tried to return to the past, her passion was tenfold because she had no ties to this world. Because she was truly alone… With no hope of anyone to reach her.<br/><br/>In her irrational moments, she thought the Jewel had pulled her back and found a new hell for her to reside in. A new hell that would force her to make a wish, but she remembered very clearly that she had wished it gone forever. That didn't stop her dreams, the times when she woke up in the night sobbing. And those memories of her past were the hardest to deal with, the hardest to forget. Her heart began to race in a panic as she turned in her bed again, her breath became a struggle as she fought against a panic attack induced by her wandering mind this late into the night.<br/><br/>She hated feeling so weak, so afraid.<br/><br/>籠の中の鳥は<br/><br/>Kagome finally pulled herself from bed, her room lit with a pale light that was enough to guide her to the bathroom. She stood before the mirror, the sink running while she stared at her reflection. Raven colored hair covered her face and she felt as bad as she looked. Her first morning in Elysion was similar to this, only she was in worse shape.<br/><br/>She had found a place to sleep, managing to work out a deal with the owner of the building to allow her to stay a small period of time without paying. Perhaps it had been Miroku's influence that allowed her to strike such deals, as the monk was known for his way in charming (or scamming) people into giving them more than enough for the work they had done. The monk had always been that way, since they had first met. He would claim the dwelling of a lord to be haunted when it was not or, claim that they were subject to an attack when they would not be. He would sell his wards and charms for such high prices. It worked practically every time and she wondered why people had been so willing to trust him.<br/><br/>Perhaps it was his smile, or the fact that he was a monk that the people of the past were so willing to crumble. He never preyed on the weak, at least. He always did what was right and he was a symbol of strength to her at times when he would push through everything in order to do what was right. He pushed through the fact that he was dying, that he was cursed, and tried to do something about it rather than wallowing in his fate. He had pushed himself to the limit in the time leading up to their final fight. And she had been glad that they had defeated Naraku before he could become subject to the same fate as his father, and his father before him.<br/><br/>As far as her own charms went, however, she was more fair than her friend and made the deal reasonable. She doubted that anyone in this world would pay a hefty price for an exorcism or banishing demons. They were too technologically advanced for that. But she was clever enough, and smart enough, to make a good deal.<br/><br/>But now, Kagome was in a better place though the look on her face looked the same. Haunted, tired, drained...<br/><br/>A quick glance at a clock on the wall told her that she could try to sleep longer. But she opted out of that, not wanting to face the flashbacks again. She took a shower instead, using the cold water to chase away her demons, to fill her lungs with a sharp intake of breath and force herself awake.<br/><br/>いついつ出やる<br/><br/>It didn't work.<br/><br/>Not in the way she was wanting. The cold water certainly forced the air into her lungs, forced her mind to wake and muscles to seize. A bitter laugh was pulled from her lips as she tilted her head back and found herself remembering more. Today, she wasn't going to escape them so easily. She wasn't going to recover so simply, to recover just because she willed it.<br/><br/>Sometimes, there's no avoiding the thoughts you wanted to. Even when you were certain that you were past them.<br/><br/>Sango would have been a great help in this situation. The demon slayer was her best friend, she would even go as far as to call her the sister that she never had. An older sister who was wise, always had her side when trouble arose. Particularly boy trouble, when such things were rather trivial but it was fun to have a crush and for her friend to be mad on her behalf when Inuyasha made her sad. After all, it had been often that the half-demon would run to his dead lover's side and break her heart more than once.<br/><br/>But, Sango also inspired her in other ways. After all the woman had faced, she had always been so strong, so sure... Even in the times that she had doubted herself, she always pulled through. She admired that she had the ability to survive after losing her whole family -- the reminder of this often pushed Kagome to survive, because she lost everyone to this world -- and then having her brother become a pawn of Naraku. It wasn't easy, couldn't have been something to that just anyone could face and still go forward with. She still smiled, even with that pain and those reminders... She was often so bright, even in the darker times.<br/><br/>And right now, she wanted to lean into the older woman's side, to take comfort in the fact that she was there and she was supportive. She felt that Sango would somehow pull through this, and offer some words of strength and understanding. It was times like these that made these spells worse, the constant reminder that she was without her family.<br/><br/>"I don't want to be alone." She cried aloud in her solitude, the sound of the shower drowning out the plea.<br/><br/>She wasn't afraid to admit it.<br/><br/>夜明けの晩に<br/><br/>Another hour had slipped by before she had realized it. Her skin was cold from the water and it felt like ice ran through her veins. She hadn't realized she had begun to shiver until her hand reached to turn off the water and end her shower. Kagome didn't seek her own gaze in the mirror again, instead, she wrapped herself in towels and trudged out of the bathroom, up the stairs and into her kitchen. She started on making a light breakfast, idly reading through her notes for the day as the food cooked.<br/><br/>Her career was really taking off these last years. Her photos were featured in many galleries, her name started to frequent many lips for those who were interested in photography.<br/><br/>The job she had asked for on a whim had sparked it all. She had been far more lucky than she had expected to be in this world. Never lucky enough to slip back through the cracks into her own world, but lucky enough to do well. As she turned back to the stove, she remembered the time she had finally given up on returning home. It was about two years into her life here, as she had started to venture into photography as more than just a hobby but something she could make a name for herself with.<br/><br/>That day had been particularly pleasant, the sun was high in the sky and she had found herself taking some photos of the natural scenery. A little boy had hidden in one of the plants, and she had caught a picture of the moment his face had settled into a cheerful, mischievous grin the moment before he had jumped out to startle his prey. It reminded her of Shippou, the little kitsune she had, essentially, adopted. He, too, had been torn from his family when they had first met. His father killed and he was determined to avenge him. While young, he did seem so mature in their first encounters.<br/><br/>Maybe it had been the influence of Inuyasha that allowed the kit to act like a kid again, to be young and whimsical at times while others he was more mature. He offered comfort to her in his own way, and she tried to care for him as she would her own though she had been so young then as well. However, her youth did not stop her from understanding how to tend to him or care for him like her child. Her heart swelled when he smiled, when he had been so happy for his gift of crayons and took the time to make art. She was so proud of each drawing that he had finished that she knew that this was how a mother would feel in such a situation.<br/><br/>The pain that had ripped through her was too much, too sudden. She missed him and wanted to see how much he had grown since she had been gone. She had missed so much...<br/><br/>To spare herself any further pain, any false hopes… She gave up. And focused on bettering herself.<br/><br/>鶴と亀が<br/><br/>Breakfast tasted bland, boring, and inspired. Only after she had finished did she realized she had forgotten to any sort of spices or flavor to the food. It was too late now to remember that much, as her mind was too busy remembering other details of her life that clearly had become more important than her food.<br/><br/>"Sit!"<br/><br/>Of course, nothing happened when she had angrily yelled at one particularly frustrating client that reminded her of the half-demon. He was being particularly stubborn and rude, wanting a photo taken his way rather than letting it work out naturally. You could try to force wild animals to behave how you wanted. But, rarely did anyone succeed with force. Inuyasha wasn't as bad, however. Inuyasha had learned before she had been forced away from him. He had become gentler, more understanding, more mature though there were times he was still childish and cocky.<br/><br/>She remember how red her cheeks had burned, but how she stood her ground and fired him. She told him she refused to work for anyone or with anyone who wanted to twist something beyond it's nature, beyond it's own desires.<br/><br/>She should have compared the man to Naraku rather than Inuyasha. Though her client did not have such extreme intentions. At least the feeling afterwards was a pleasant memory. The freedom of knowing that she had come so far that she could refuse work that she didn't want to do, to be her own person that was independent of others. She could say that she made it at that point. Even though she heard rumors days later with words meant to slander her.<br/><br/>She defended herself righteously, like she did towards the end of her journey. After all, she was the only one who could protect herself in this world.<br/><br/>滑った<br/><br/>Morning light began to creep into her home, reminding her again of the passage of time. Again, she considered the list of things she had to do and debated on where to start. Or, if she should even start at all. With how the day began, she didn't know if she could consider that a great idea. It was doubtful that she would be successful with how lost in herself she was becoming.<br/><br/>She didn't want to mess up her latest work. Because she had done that on a few occasions before. It wasn't pleasant to try and recover from a complete disaster.<br/><br/>Kagome remembered the feeling of her expensive, brand new, camera slipping from her hands. She wasn't prepared to support it, because she had just removed it from her bag. Part of her screamed on the inside. A dramatic, over-the-top, full on scream that she frequently did when she was much, much younger. When she was struggling to make it through middle school while hopping between times. The other part of her had remained frozen in place while her lense completely shattered and the rest of the camera had broken along with it.<br/><br/>Seeing Inuyasha's brother, a full demon, standing before her was the last thing she expected when she had made her way out for her photos. He stood as proud as ever, as tall as ever, as imposing as she remembered. He didn't look fazed at all to be in an entirely different world, though she was never the best at reading his mind. His name on her lips was so potent, that she could remember the tiniest feelings as she did. Her lips were chapped, her mouth felt dry, and the bubbling feeling of anxiety in her stomach made her feel sick.<br/><br/>She didn't want her hopes to be up.<br/><br/>But, she wanted him to be there, even if they were not friends. They were allies, if anything, since they had fought side by side. And something was better than absolutely nothing.<br/><br/>And Kagome had the sense enough not to throw herself at him, to wrap her arms around him in relief that knowing she was not alone. Her camera no longer mattered when she approached him. She remembered that nothing else mattered for days as she spent time with him, not speaking of their world but speaking (or, she was speaking and he simply acknowledged that fact).<br/><br/>When, exactly, she fell for him though… Kagome couldn't recall. It was a subtle thing, just like he was. But she knew the feeling was there. And he let her know that she was not alone in the fact that she had fallen, that feelings had somehow blossomed.<br/><br/>後ろの正面<br/><br/>A feeling of weightlessness overtook her and suddenly her eyes opened while her mind desperately clawed for the last thing she was doing. She didn't recall when she had fallen asleep on her couch, but she knew the last place she had been was on the far too comfortable cushions. She didn't struggle, however, or fight the weightlessness as she was in familiar arms. Her head tilted against Sesshoumaru's chest, taking comfort in the fact that he was here and she wasn't alone.<br/><br/>"Welcome back." His response was a soft hum in acknowledgement. He didn't need to speak much for her to understand his intent, or the rest of what he had to say.<br/><br/>He carried her back to her bed, settled her into it with ease. Her eyes met his and she smiled easily because no more memories drifted back, no more recollections teased at her. No, whenever he was near, she never fell back into those thoughts. He had helped, and the years had helped. Today was just… One of those days.<br/><br/>"Sleep." He commanded with ease, her eyes rolled at him but she did not fight because she was tired. Her hand clung tightly to him, while she felt his opposite hand press to her forehead in assessment of her wellbeing.<br/><br/>"I'm okay," she said, her words firm with her promise.<br/><br/>She was okay. She was alive. And she was happy.<br/><br/>だあれ<br/><br/>shipper<br/><br/>summary<br/><br/>Kagome, at one point in her life, was a rather regular teenage girl until she was attacked by a demon inside her family's well house. The demon dragged her down into the well, which magically transported her about 500 years into the past. There, she learned that a sacred jewel was encased inside her body as she was the reincarnation of a priestess that had died 50 years prior to the time she was dragged into. The jewel was ripped from her body and the demon that dragged her through time was defeated by the half-demon that she freed who was pinned to the tree. Kagome befriended the half-demon, Inuyasha, in time and traveled with him to restore the jewel that she, herself, shattered. Though it was not so straightforward and easy to do as many demons and humans sought the jewel for their own purposes. She befriended a young kitsune demon, a monk, and a demon slayer who all traveled with her to restore the jewel.<br/><br/>Her group, however, was not the one to complete the jewel. Instead, an evil half-demon who manipulated the majority of the major events in most of her companion's lives. When he finally collected all the pieces of the jewel and made his wish on the tainted object, Kagome was drawn into the jewel itself with the intent of her making a selfish wish to keep her trapped inside forever, keeping the jewel alive. It was the stubbornness of Inuyasha that managed to save her from the darkness. In the end, she returned to her natural time, finished high school as was expect from a girl of her timeline. Though days later, Kagome ended up in Elysion. She has been in this world for five years, and has long since given up on returning home. She's settled happily into her new life.<br/><br/>platonic<br/><br/>It's rather easy for Kagome to make new friends, she hasn't changed much from her youth. She is a cheerful young woman who is empathetic and welcoming to most of all in her life. In her youth, she befriended demons when most would fear them. Even demons that used to eat humans, she has befriended and she changed their ways (she'd like to think). This being said, it's really easy to become her friend as long as someone is able to shown that they are willing to be redeemed, or show that they are not completely evil. She feels greatly for everyone she meets, so it's hard for her not to be drawn to others in a desire to be friends.<br/><br/>antagonistic<br/><br/>The only way to earn Kagome's wrath is to be so deplorable, so evil, and so far beyond redemption that she can't see any good in you. And she can see the good in pretty much everyone and everything. Honestly, with whom she has faced? A half-demon that pitted two lovers against each other, that cursed the entire male line of one of her friends, and then had her best friend's brother kill their family… Yeah, I don't see her hating anyone without them really, really working for it. Feel free to give it a shot, though.<br/><br/>romantic<br/><br/>When in love, Kagome is a strong support, always staying there even when things may be rough. However, Kagome is not looking for love, wasn't looking for love when she arrived so any past relationships don't exist. This isn't to say that someone hasn't fallen in love with her. She can definitely be the subject of someone's unrequited love, she'll probably be oblivious about it, though. Finally, Kagome is currently engaged to Sesshoumaru, surprisingly. I'm totally open to potential AU things, though. <3<br/><br/>fandom hell<br/><br/>age ancient<br/><br/>species space queen<br/><br/>occupation dying<br/><br/>prefers she/her<br/><br/>awards<br/><br/>pro<br/>she/her est 62woo i suck at plot replies. but ok anyway!!! neptune is very friendly and has that 'cool' persona, he's really fun to be around, and he's SUPER good to work with. like he's super patient and he'll do anything she asks of him--he's really easy to work with, definitely in comparison to other models. so i love the idea of them being all work oriented friends at first and then turning into something more. neptune definitely tries to surround himself with people, because he loves having friends, and kagome is pretty much his type too? like she's sweet and she's a strong woman, and he is actually better friends with women than he is with men, idk why, he just loves being surrounded by female friends who knows. i love my guys being super good friends and protecting their girl friends honestly. but oh M A N i love pseduo-family type relationships and neptune is an only child, so he hasn't had any like, familial relationships like that. so her looking out for him all big sister like would make him be like ????? cause he's confused but also he actually really likes that LOL! they're both good kids, i think they'd be really fun ^^<br/><br/>fandom fire emblem: fates<br/><br/>age ninteen<br/><br/>species Part human / part dragon<br/><br/>occupation representative guardian<br/><br/>prefers she/her<br/><br/>awards<br/><br/>yonder<br/>she/her aest 20 posts<br/><br/>I haven't seen Inuyasha at all but... from what I've read Kagome seems to be one of those people who might be able to help Corrin out with her emotional state. There's a lot weighing on her mind since she had to fight her birth family against her will and last time she saw them they all pretty much hated her. Frankly she hasn't worked through everything yet since she was essentially at the head of a full-scale war. I feel they could be friends as Corrin is quite open in her personality, extremely trusting as well. She's just... hiding and struggling through a lot.

I love your idea of Kagome taking a pic of Elsa! You know, she's also a singer/performer at a local theater so I can imagine Kagome going there to scope things out and then catching Elsa backstage or something--and then the friendship could blossom from there! I absolutely adore the idea of these two spending quality bff time together doing the small but fun things Elsa never experienced as a child.

Dokáže tiež cítiť démonické aury, ako aj zlé aury. Keď sa však narodila a vyrastala, jej sily boli zapečatené a bola oveľa menej mocná. Od porážky toho, kto zapečatil jej sily, Kagome dosiahla svoj plný potenciál.<br/><br/>PURIFIKÁCIA Vytvorením fyzického spojenia má Kagome schopnosť očistiť jed aj tmu od subjektu (živého aj neživého). Aby tak urobila, premieta svoje duchovné sily prostredníctvom svojej ruky.<br/><br/>S plným potenciálom má Kagome schopnosť vytvoriť bariéru okolo seba a rozšíriť ju okolo ostatných. Je to bariéra v tvare kupoly, ktorá môže zničiť slabých démonov, ktorí sa dostanú do kontaktu s bariérou.<br/><br/>ZLEPŠENÉ OČI<br/>Kagome má schopnosť vidieť veci, ktoré sú často neviditeľné pre ľudské oko: duchovia, duchovia, božské a zlé aury.<br/><br/>ZABEZPEČENIE ZBRANÍ<br/>Kagome má schopnosť používať luk a šípy. Bola vyškolená sama a po rokoch praxe jej šíp zriedka chýba. Okrem toho má Kagome schopnosť naplniť svoje šípy silami. Ona môže naliať šípy so svojimi duchovnými silami, ktoré im umožňuje preniknúť démonické sily, zničiť kúzla, a očistiť objekty. Ona môže naliať jej luk so svojimi silami a odraziť nepriateľské útoky. Má schopnosť naplniť svoje šípy čistiacou energiou, aby očistila jed, rovnako ako silné, dlho vzdialené démonické útoky. A nakoniec má schopnosť obísť ostatných šípkou: Ak sa jej cieľ stane za bariérou alebo rukojemníkom, šíp sa môže teleportovať a zasiahnuť iba jej cieľ.<br/><br/>Zvyšok jej schopností sa stal dosť nedôležitým, pretože súvisia s cestovaním v čase (cez Studňu požierača kostí), s klenotom Shikon alebo s jej predchádzajúcou inkarnáciou.<br/><br/>kánon<br/><br/>Kagome bola vytiahnutá niekoľko dní po ukončení strednej školy, predtým, ako sa studňa Bone Eater opäť otvorila, aby sa mohla natrvalo vrátiť do minulosti.<br/><br/>freestyle<br/><br/>Spomienky<br/><br/>Zľavy<br/><br/>Zvuk jej mena bol jemný šepot v zadnej časti jej mysle, ako volanie tlmené vetrom. Bol to zvuk vzdialenej pamäte, hlas, ktorý začala zabúdať, ale zúfalo sa pridŕžal všetkých rovnakých. Bol to hlas jej matky, skrútený v smútku jej stratenej dcéry. Koniec koncov, Kagome vyhnala bez stopy. Živo si spomenula na tie chvíle, na to, ako sa deň začal, čo mala na raňajky a poslednú vec, ktorú povedala svojej matke. Bolo to strašidelné, tie spomienky, pretože to bolo ako kedykoľvek predtým, keď sa skĺzla medzi svetmi. Zobudila sa, apatická, pretože nemala žiadny účel mimo školy. Mohla si nájsť prácu a v ten deň bola naplánovaná na rozhovor. Jej srdce v ňom nebolo, ale bolo to to, čo potrebovala urobiť.<br/><br/>Spomenula si na pocit hrôzy, nasávala to a dávala si povzbudzujúci rozhovor, že by to mohla urobiť. Že by mohla pokročiť v živote, ktorý mala teraz, keď sa veci vyriešili v minulosti. Samozrejme, mala pretrvávajúci pocit, že už nepatrí do svojho času alebo vlastného života. Nie so všetkým, čo zanechala.<br/><br/>Kagome si spomenula na pocit dreva pod prstami, spôsob, akým sa jej ruka stočila do rukoväte, aby otvorila dvere. Spomenula si, že sa odmlčala a obrátila sa k svojej matke s jasným a živým úsmevom, keď sa triasla zo svojej strnulosti. "Odchádzam." Spomenula si, aký silný jej hlas znel, úsmev na perách jej matky, keď jej oči žiarili pýchou. Jej matka sa rozlúčila, čo sa nezdalo inak ako predtým, ale váha slov sa na Kagomeových pleciach nejako usadila ťažšie, čím viac odrážala.<br/><br/>V krátkosti, myšlienky zablýskala dopredu, premýšľal, či jej matka strach o ňu, chýbal ju ako ona. Kagome mohol otvorene priznať, že sila jej matky, jej podpora pre skutočnosť, že jej dcéra prekĺzla časom tak často. Boli časy, keď si myslela, že je slabá, pretože nemá ženu, o ktorú by sa mohla oprieť.<br/><br/>Spomenula si však, že nabrala skromné množstvo sily. Pamätala si na posun vo vzduchu, teplotu, ktorá sa výrazne líšila od toho, čo očakávala, a žmurkala na náhle a neznáme okolie. Nebola to svätyňa jej rodiny. A keď sa obrátila, aby sa vrátila, aby prekĺzla cez dvere, cez ktoré prešla, stretla sa s neznámym a studeným kovom pod prstami a interiérom, ktorý nebol vchodom do jej domu. Muž stál pred ňou, za pultom, ktorý na ňu hľadel s očami širokými ako jej vlastné.<br/><br/>Neprepadala panike, keď bola roztrhaná v čase a umiestnená do nemožných situácií, aspoň si vybudovala svoju vôľu, pokiaľ ide o podivné udalosti. Pretože to nebolo každý deň, keď sa niekto ocitol vtiahnutý do minulosti démonom, ktorý chcel vytrhnúť mocný klenot z ich tela, o ktorom ani nevedeli, že tam je. A potom tam bol fakt, že ona rozbila povedal silný klenot do kto vie, koľko kusov a bol poverený ich nájsť. Takéto veci neboli normálne, a ona potrebovala štvorec sa s ním, akonáhle si uvedomila, že to bola jej realita. Zdalo sa to tak jednoduché, len zhromaždiť črepy a opraviť klenot.<br/><br/>Ale nebolo to ľahké, bolo tam veľa démonov po črepinách a klenote samotnom. A jeden obzvlášť silný démon s prianím, že bol odhodlaný vidieť splnené. Do dnešného dňa sa nikdy nenaučila jeho želanie, ale vedela, že nikdy nebolo udelené, ani keď mal hotovú tú prekliatu vec. Zničil toľko životov kvôli ničomu. Zničil toľko životov za takú márnu úlohu. Naraku bola najťažšia nepriateľka a tá, ktorá bola stredobodom všetkého, čo sa v živote jej priateľky pokazilo.<br/><br/>Ale bola to tá nepredvídateľnosť, tá nutnosť vrátiť sa k tomu, čo sa deje, a sila vôle, ktorú získala zo svojho dobrodružstva, na ktorú si spomenula, keď čerpala, aby prišla s príbehom, ktorý sa zmestil do okamihu, ktorý sa nezdal príliš rozmarný alebo ďaleko pritiahnutý. Potrebovala, aby jej verili, aby prežila.<br/><br/>Koniec koncov, čelila horšiemu ako muž v obchode s kamerami. Klamala cez zuby, aby si predtým zachránila život.<br/><br/>"Hľadal som si prácu." Nakoniec to nebola úplná lož. Koniec koncov, vyrazila z domu s úmyslom zúčastniť sa pracovného pohovoru. Jej stav oblečenia by to aspoň potvrdil. Bola to jedna z ľahších lží, ktoré kedy povedala.<br/><br/>A z nejakého dôvodu si ju ten blázon najal.<br/><br/>Zľavy<br/><br/>Kagomed sa prevrátila vo svojej posteli, keď zatlačila vzdialené spomienky, odmietajúc uznať, že bola naozaj hore. Vydrápala sa pri posledných zábleskoch spánku, prosila ho, aby sa vrátil a vzal ju späť do svojho objatia. Zavrela oči, ochotne spala a stretla sa len so spomienkami. Ozveny piesne spievali v diaľke jej spomienok, pieseň, ktorá ju často trápila, dostala rovnaké meno ako ona. Hlas, ktorý spievala, už viac nepripomínal jej matku, ale hlasy detí, s ktorými sa často hrala, keď vyrastala. Zavolali si spomienky, aj keď to boli roky, čo začala žiť, aj keď bola v tomto živote šťastná, volanie týchto spomienok bolo príliš hlasné.<br/><br/>Zrazu sa do nich vrátila a znovu sa jej vyhýbala. Sledovala sa v objatí svojej rodiny, zatiaľ čo Inuyasha bola vytiahnutá späť do studne, vyzerala tak vyľakane, ako sa cítila. Spomienky na ten moment, tie pocity, boli stále tak silné. Pocit zlomeného srdca a smútku sa opäť vynoril, aj keď to bolo tak dávno, čo mala pocit, že bola odtrhnutá od všetkého, čo jej záležalo.<br/><br/>Samozrejme, na jej rodine záležalo a bola šťastná, že je opäť v ich náručí. Nikdy nemohla úplne, skutočne opísať, ako sa v tých dňoch cítila. Stále nedokázala vysvetliť, ako sa cítila rozdelená na dve časti, s bojujúcimi túžbami byť vo svojej minulosti aj v súčasnosti. Spomenula si na márne pokusy skočiť cez studňu, prsty sa škrabali na zem v zúfalej prosbe, aby ju nechali vrátiť sa. Prvý mesiac doma nespala toľko, ako plakala.<br/><br/>Elysion priniesla podobnú reakciu, hoci to nebolo tak divoké, pretože nevedela presne, kde sa prekĺzla, ani nevedela, kde by sa mohla vrátiť späť. Jej skúmanie bolo jemné medzi prácou a pokusom usadiť sa v tomto živote. Nemala v úmysle zostať, nemala v úmysle zostať dlhšie, než potrebovala. A aj keď sa nesnažila tak tvrdo, ako keď sa snažila vrátiť do minulosti, jej vášeň bola desaťnásobná, pretože nemala žiadne väzby na tento svet.<br/><br/>Vo svojich iracionálnych chvíľach si myslela, že ju Klenot pritiahol späť a našiel pre ňu nové peklo. Nové peklo, ktoré by ju prinútilo, aby si niečo želala, ale veľmi jasne si spomenula, že si želala, aby to navždy zmizlo. To nezastavilo jej sny, časy, keď sa zobudila v noci vzlykajúc a tie spomienky z jej minulosti boli najťažšie riešiť, najťažšie zabudnúť. Jej srdce začalo pretekať v panike, keď sa otočila v posteli znova, jej dych sa stal bojom, keď bojovala proti panickému záchvatu vyvolanému jej blúdiacou mysľou tak neskoro do noci.<br/><br/>Nenávidela pocit, že je taká slabá, taká vystrašená.<br/><br/>Zľavy<br/><br/>Kagome sa konečne vytiahla z postele, jej izba osvetlená bledým svetlom, ktoré stačilo na to, aby ju doviedlo do kúpeľne. Stála pred zrkadlom, umývadlo bežalo, zatiaľ čo sa pozerala na svoj odraz. Raven farebné vlasy zakryli jej tvár a ona sa cítila tak zlé, ako vyzerala. Jej prvé ráno v Elysion bol podobný tomuto, len ona bola v horšom stave.<br/><br/>Našla si miesto na spanie a podarilo sa jej dohodnúť sa s majiteľom budovy, aby mohla zostať malú dobu bez platenia. Možno to bol vplyv Miroku, ktorý jej umožnil uzatvárať takéto dohody, pretože mních bol známy svojou cestou v očarovaní (alebo podvádzaní) ľudí, aby im dali viac ako dosť pre prácu, ktorú urobili. Mních bol vždy taký, odkedy sa prvýkrát stretli. Tvrdil, že obydlie pána je prenasledované, keď to nebolo, alebo tvrdil, že boli predmetom útoku, keď by neboli. Predával svoje oddelenia a kúzla za také vysoké ceny. Zakaždým to fungovalo a ona sa čudovala, prečo boli ľudia takí ochotní mu dôverovať.<br/><br/>Možno to bol jeho úsmev, alebo skutočnosť, že bol mních, že ľudia v minulosti boli tak ochotní rozpadnúť. Vždy robil to, čo bolo správne a bol pre ňu symbolom sily v čase, keď všetko pretlačil, aby urobil to, čo bolo správne. Pretlačil sa cez skutočnosť, že zomiera, že je prekliaty, a snažil sa s tým niečo urobiť, namiesto toho, aby sa utápal v jeho osude. V čase, ktorý viedol k ich konečnému boju, sa tlačil na hranicu. A bola rada, že porazili Naraku skôr, než sa mohol stať predmetom rovnakého osudu ako jeho otec, a jeho otec pred ním.<br/><br/>Pokiaľ však išlo o jej vlastné kúzlo, bola spravodlivejšia ako jej priateľka a urobila dohodu rozumnou. Pochybovala, že ktokoľvek na tomto svete zaplatí za exorcizmus alebo vyhnanie démonov vysokú cenu. Boli na to príliš technologicky vyspelí. Ale bola dosť múdra a dosť múdra na to, aby urobila dobrú dohodu.<br/><br/>Ale teraz bola Kagome na lepšom mieste, aj keď jej tvár vyzerala rovnako. Strašidelná, unavená, vyčerpaná...<br/><br/>Rýchly pohľad na hodiny na stene jej povedal, že by sa mohla pokúsiť spať dlhšie. Ale ona sa rozhodla z toho, nechcel čeliť flashbacks znova. Namiesto toho sa osprchovala studenou vodou, aby vyhnala svojich démonov, naplnila pľúca ostrým prívodom dychu a prinútila sa prebudiť.<br/><br/>Zľavy<br/><br/>Nefungovalo to.<br/><br/>Nie tak, ako chcela. Studená voda určite nútila vzduch do pľúc, nútila jej myseľ prebudiť sa a svaly, aby sa chytili. Horký smiech bol vytiahnutý z jej pier, keď naklonila hlavu dozadu a zistila, že si pamätá viac. Dnes im nechcela tak ľahko uniknúť, nechcela sa tak jednoducho zotaviť len preto, že to chcela.<br/><br/>Niekedy nie je možné vyhnúť sa myšlienkam, ktoré ste chceli, aj keď ste si boli istí, že ste ich prešli.<br/><br/>Sango by bolo veľkou pomocou v tejto situácii. Démon vrah bol jej najlepší priateľ, ona by dokonca ísť tak ďaleko, aby ju nazval sestru, že nikdy nemal. Staršia sestra, ktorá bola múdra, vždy mal svoju stranu, keď vznikli problémy. Najmä chlapec problémy, keď také veci boli skôr triviálne, ale to bolo zábavné mať zamilovanosť a pre jej priateľ byť naštvaný v jej mene, keď Inuyasha ju smutný. Koniec koncov, často sa stávalo, že polovičný démon bežal na stranu svojho mŕtveho milenca a zlomil jej srdce viac ako raz.<br/><br/>Ale Sango ju inšpirovalo aj inými spôsobmi. Po tom všetkom, čomu žena čelila, bola vždy taká silná, taká istá... Aj v časoch, keď o sebe pochybovala, vždy sa cez to preniesla. Obdivovala, že má schopnosť prežiť po tom, čo stratila celú svoju rodinu - pripomienka toho často tlačil Kagome prežiť, pretože stratila každého na tomto svete - a potom sa jej brat stal pešiakom Naraku. Nebolo to ľahké, nemohlo to byť niečo, čomu by mohol každý čeliť a stále s tým pokračovať. Stále sa usmievala, dokonca aj s tou bolesťou a tými pripomienkami... Často bola taká jasná, dokonca aj v temných časoch.<br/><br/>A práve teraz sa chcela nakloniť na stranu staršej ženy, aby sa utešila tým, že tam bola a podporovala. Mala pocit, že Sango to nejako zvládne a ponúkne nejaké slová sily a porozumenia. Boli to časy, ako sú tieto, ktoré robili tieto kúzla horšie, neustála pripomienka, že bola bez svojej rodiny.<br/><br/>"Nechcem byť sám." Plakala nahlas vo svojej samote, zvuk sprchy prehlušil prosbu.<br/><br/>Nebála sa to priznať.<br/><br/>Zľavy<br/><br/>Ďalšia hodina ušla, kým si to neuvedomila. Jej koža bola studená z vody a cítila, ako by jej v žilách prešiel ľad. Neuvedomila si, že sa začala triasť, kým jej ruka nedosiahla, aby vypla vodu a ukončila sprchu. Kagome opäť nehľadala svoj vlastný pohľad v zrkadle, namiesto toho sa zabalila do uterákov a vybehla z kúpeľne, hore po schodoch a do svojej kuchyne. Začala variť ľahké raňajky, nečinne čítala svoje poznámky na deň, keď sa jedlo varilo.<br/><br/>Jej kariéra sa v posledných rokoch naozaj rozbiehala. Jej fotografie boli prezentované v mnohých galériách, jej meno sa začalo objavovať na mnohých perách pre tých, ktorí sa zaujímali o fotografovanie.<br/><br/>Práca, o ktorú požiadala z rozmaru, to všetko vyvolala. Mala oveľa väčšie šťastie, než očakávala, že bude v tomto svete. Nikdy to šťastie, že sa vráti späť cez trhliny do svojho vlastného sveta, ale to šťastie, že sa darí dobre. Keď sa otočila k sporáku, spomenula si na čas, keď sa konečne vzdala návratu domov. Bolo to asi dva roky jej života tu, pretože sa začala odvážiť fotografovať ako viac ako len hobby, ale niečo, s čím by si mohla urobiť meno.<br/><br/>Ten deň bol obzvlášť príjemný, slnko bolo vysoko na oblohe a ona sa ocitla pri fotografovaní prírodných scenérií. Malý chlapec sa ukryl v jednej z rastlín a ona zachytila obraz okamihu, keď sa jeho tvár usadila do veselého, zlomyseľného úsmevu momentu predtým, ako vyskočil, aby vyľakal svoju korisť. Pripomenulo jej to Shippou, malú kitune, ktorú v podstate adoptovala. Aj on bol odtrhnutý od svojej rodiny, keď sa prvýkrát stretli. Jeho otec zabil a on bol odhodlaný ho pomstiť. Keď bol mladý, vyzeral tak zrelý v ich prvých stretnutiach.<br/><br/>Možno to bol vplyv Inuyasha, ktorý umožnil, aby sa kit opäť správal ako dieťa, aby bol mladý a náladový, zatiaľ čo iní boli vyspelejší. Ponúkol jej útechu svojím vlastným spôsobom a ona sa snažila starať o neho tak, ako by sa starala o seba, aj keď bola vtedy taká mladá. Jej mladosť jej však nebránila pochopiť, ako sa o neho starať alebo sa o neho starať ako jej dieťa. Jej srdce napuchlo, keď sa usmial, keď bol tak šťastný za svoj dar pastelky a vzal čas, aby sa umenie. Bola tak hrdá na každú kresbu, že dokončil, že vedela, že to je, ako sa matka bude cítiť v takejto situácii.<br/><br/>Bolesť, ktorá sa cez ňu prehnala, bola príliš veľká, príliš náhla. Chýbala mu a chcela vidieť, ako veľmi narástol, odkedy bola preč. Tak veľmi jej chýbalo...<br/><br/>Aby sa ušetrila akejkoľvek ďalšej bolesti, akejkoľvek falošnej nádeje... vzdala sa a sústredila sa na to, aby sa zlepšila.<br/><br/>Zľavy<br/><br/>Raňajky boli nevýrazné, nudné a inšpirujúce. Až keď skončila, uvedomila si, že zabudla na akékoľvek korenie alebo chuť jedla. Bolo už príliš neskoro na to, aby si to pamätala, pretože jej myseľ bola príliš zaneprázdnená pamätaním si ďalších detailov svojho života, ktoré sa zjavne stali dôležitejšími ako jej jedlo.<br/><br/>"Sadni si!"<br/><br/>Samozrejme, nič sa nestalo, keď nahnevane kričala na jedného obzvlášť frustrujúceho klienta, ktorý jej pripomenul polovičného démona. Bol obzvlášť tvrdohlavý a hrubý, chcel fotografiu, ktorá mu bola odobratá, namiesto toho, aby to fungovalo prirodzene. Mohli by ste sa pokúsiť prinútiť divoké zvieratá, aby sa správali tak, ako ste chceli. Ale zriedka sa niekomu podarilo silou. Inuyasha však nebola taká zlá. Inuyasha sa naučila predtým, ako bola nútená od neho. Stal sa jemnejším, rozumnejším, dospelejším, hoci boli časy, keď bol ešte detinský a nafúkaný.<br/><br/>Pamätá si, ako jej červené tváre pálili, ale ako stála na zemi a vyhodila ho. Povedala mu, že odmietla pracovať pre kohokoľvek alebo s každým, kto chcel prekrúcať niečo, čo presahuje jej prirodzenosť, nad jej vlastné túžby.<br/><br/>Mala prirovnať muža k Naraku skôr ako Inuyasha. Aj keď jej klient nemal také extrémne úmysly. Aspoň ten pocit potom bola príjemná spomienka. Sloboda vedieť, že prišla tak ďaleko, že mohla odmietnuť prácu, ktorú nechcela robiť, byť sama sebou, ktorá bola nezávislá od ostatných. Napriek tomu, že o niekoľko dní počula klebety so slovami, ktoré ju mali ohovárať.<br/><br/>Spravodlivo sa bránila, ako to urobila na konci svojej cesty. Koniec koncov, bola jediná, ktorá sa mohla chrániť na tomto svete.<br/><br/>Zľavy<br/><br/>Ranné svetlo sa začalo vkrádať do jej domu a opäť jej pripomenulo plynutie času. Opäť zvažovala zoznam vecí, ktoré musí urobiť, a diskutovala o tom, kde začať. Alebo, ak by vôbec mala začať. S tým, ako sa deň začal, nevedela, či to môže považovať za skvelý nápad. Bolo pochybné, že by bola úspešná s tým, ako sa stratila v sebe.<br/><br/>Nechcela pokaziť svoju najnovšiu prácu, pretože to urobila pri niekoľkých príležitostiach predtým. Nebolo príjemné pokúsiť sa zotaviť sa z úplnej katastrofy.<br/><br/>Kagome si spomenula na pocit jej drahého, úplne nového fotoaparátu, ktorý sa jej vykĺzol z rúk. Nebola pripravená ju podporiť, pretože ju práve vytiahla z tašky. Časť z nej kričala vo vnútri. Dramatický, over-the-top, plný výkrik, že ona často robil, keď ona bola oveľa, oveľa mladšie. Keď sa snažila, aby to cez strednú školu, zatiaľ čo hopping medzi časmi. Druhá jej časť zostala zamrznutá na mieste, zatiaľ čo jej šošovka sa úplne rozbila a zvyšok fotoaparátu sa zlomil spolu s ním.<br/><br/>Vidieť Inuyashinho brata, úplného démona, stáť pred ňou bola posledná vec, ktorú očakávala, keď sa dostala von pre svoje fotografie. Stál tak hrdý ako kedykoľvek predtým, tak vysoký ako kedykoľvek predtým, tak impozantný, ako si pamätala. Vôbec nevyzeral očarený, že by bol v úplne inom svete, hoci nikdy nebola najlepšia v čítaní jeho mysle. Jeho meno na perách bolo také silné, že si mohla pamätať aj tie najmenšie pocity, ako to urobila. Jej pery boli popraskané, ústa sa cítili suché a bublajúci pocit úzkosti v žalúdku jej spôsobil, že sa cítila zle.<br/><br/>Nechcela, aby jej nádej bola hore.<br/><br/>Ale chcela, aby tam bol, aj keď neboli priatelia. Boli to spojenci, ak niečo, pretože bojovali bok po boku. A niečo bolo lepšie ako absolútne nič.<br/><br/>A Kagome mala dosť rozumu, aby sa na neho nevrhla, aby ho objala s úľavou, že vedela, že nie je sama. Jej fotoaparát už nezáležal, keď sa k nemu priblížila. Spomenula si, že na ničom inom nezáležalo celé dni, keď s ním trávila čas, nehovorila o ich svete, ale hovorila (alebo hovorila a on to jednoducho uznal).<br/><br/>Keď sa doňho zamilovala, Kagome si to nepamätala. Bola to jemná vec, presne ako on. Ale vedela, že ten pocit tam bol. A on jej dal vedieť, že nie je sama v tom, že padla, že pocity nejako rozkvitli.<br/><br/>Zľavy<br/><br/>Pocit beztiaže ju predbehol a zrazu sa jej otvorili oči, zatiaľ čo jej myseľ zúfalo pazúrovala za poslednú vec, ktorú robila. Nepamätala si, kedy zaspala na gauči, ale vedela, že posledné miesto, kde bola, bolo na príliš pohodlných vankúšoch. Nebojovala však ani bojovala proti beztiaži, pretože bola v známom náručí. Hlava sa jej naklonila k hrudi Sesshoumaru, utešujúc sa tým, že on bol tu a ona nebola sama.<br/><br/>"Vitajte späť." Jeho odpoveď bola mäkké hučanie v uznaní. Nepotreboval veľa hovoriť, aby pochopila svoj zámer, alebo zvyšok toho, čo musel povedať.<br/><br/>Odniesol ju späť do postele, usadil ju do nej s ľahkosťou. Jej oči sa stretli s jeho a ona sa ľahko usmievala, pretože žiadne ďalšie spomienky sa nevrátili späť, žiadne ďalšie spomienky sa na ňu. Nie, kedykoľvek bol blízko, nikdy sa do týchto myšlienok nevrátila. Pomohol, a roky pomohli. Dnes bol len jeden z tých dní.<br/><br/>"Spánok." Prikázal s ľahkosťou, jej oči sa valili na neho, ale ona nebojovala, pretože bola unavená. Jej ruka pevne priľnula k nemu, zatiaľ čo ona cítila jeho opačnú ruku stlačte na čelo pri posudzovaní jej blahobytu.<br/><br/>"Som v poriadku," povedala, jej slová pevné s jej sľubom.<br/><br/>Bola v poriadku, bola nažive a bola šťastná.<br/><br/>Zľavy<br/><br/>prepravca<br/><br/>Zhrnutie<br/><br/>Kagome, v jednom okamihu svojho života, bola pomerne pravidelné dospievajúce dievča, kým bola napadnutá démonom v jej rodinnom studni. Démon ju zatiahol do studne, ktorá ju magicky preniesla asi 500 rokov do minulosti. Tam sa dozvedela, že vo vnútri jej tela bol zabalený posvätný klenot, pretože bola reinkarnáciou kňažky, ktorá zomrela 50 rokov pred časom, keď bola vtiahnutá do nej. Klenot bol vytrhnutý z jej tela a démon, ktorý ju tiahol časom, bol porazený polovičným démonom, ktorého oslobodil, ktorý bol pripnutý k stromu. Kagome sa spriatelil s polovičným démonom, Inuyasha, v čase a cestoval s ním, aby obnovil klenot, ktorý ona sama rozbila. Hoci to nebolo tak jednoduché a ľahké robiť toľko démonov a ľudí hľadalo klenot pre svoje vlastné účely. Spriatelila sa s mladým démonom Kitsune, mníchom a zabijakom démonov, ktorí všetci cestovali s ňou, aby obnovili klenot.<br/><br/>Jej skupina však nebola tá, ktorá dokončila klenot. Namiesto toho zlý polovičný démon, ktorý manipuloval s väčšinou hlavných udalostí vo väčšine životov jej spoločníka. Keď konečne zhromaždil všetky kúsky klenotu a urobil si želanie na poškvrnenom predmete, Kagome bola vtiahnutá do samotného klenotu s úmyslom, aby si sebecké želanie, aby ju udržalo uväznenú vo vnútri navždy, pričom šperk zostal nažive. Bola to tvrdohlavosť Inuyasha, ktorá ju dokázala zachrániť pred temnotou. Nakoniec sa vrátila do svojho prirodzeného času, dokončila strednú školu, ako sa očakávalo od dievčaťa z jej časovej osi. Hoci o niekoľko dní neskôr Kagome skončila v Elysion. Je na tomto svete už päť rokov a už dávno sa vzdala návratu domov.<br/><br/>platonický<br/><br/>Pre Kagome je pomerne ľahké nájsť si nových priateľov, od mladosti sa veľmi nezmenila. Je to veselá mladá žena, ktorá je empatická a vítajúca väčšinu zo všetkého vo svojom živote. V mladosti sa spriatelila s démonmi, keď sa ich väčšina bála. Dokonca aj démoni, ktorí jedli ľudí, sa spriatelila a zmenila ich spôsoby (ráda by si myslela). Je naozaj ľahké stať sa jej priateľom, pokiaľ je niekto schopný ukázať, že je ochotný byť vykúpený, alebo ukázať, že nie je úplne zlý. Cíti sa veľmi pre každého, koho stretne, takže je pre ňu ťažké, aby nebola priťahovaná k ostatným v túžbe byť priateľmi.<br/><br/>antagonistické<br/><br/>Jediný spôsob, ako získať Kagome hnev je byť tak poľutovaniahodný, tak zlý, a tak ďaleko za vykúpenie, že nemôže vidieť žiadne dobro vo vás. A ona môže vidieť dobro v skoro každý a všetko. Úprimne povedané, s kým sa stretla? Napoly démon, ktorý proti sebe postavil dvoch milencov, ktorý preklial celú mužskú líniu jedného z jej priateľov, a potom prinútil brata svojho najlepšieho priateľa zabiť ich rodinu... Ale neváhajte a skúste to.<br/><br/>romantický<br/><br/>Keď je zamilovaná, Kagome je silná podpora, vždy tam zostane, aj keď to môže byť ťažké. Kagome však nehľadá lásku, nehľadala lásku, keď prišla, takže žiadne minulé vzťahy neexistujú. To však neznamená, že sa do nej niekto nezamiloval. Určite môže byť predmetom neopätovanej lásky niekoho, pravdepodobne o tom bude zabúdať. Nakoniec, Kagome je v súčasnosti prekvapivo zasnúbená so Sesshoumaru.

Neptune sa rozhodne snaží obklopiť sa s ľuďmi, pretože miluje mať priateľov, a kagome je do značnej miery jeho typ taky? ako ona je sladká a ona je silná žena, a on je vlastne lepší priatelia so ženami, než je s mužmi, idk prečo, on jednoducho miluje byť obklopený ženskými priateľmi, ktorí vedia.

Páči sa mi vaša predstava, že Kagome vezme fotku Elsy! Viete, ona je tiež speváčka / performer v miestnom divadle, takže si viem predstaviť, že Kagome tam pôjde, aby veci vyriešil a potom chytil Elsu do zákulisia alebo tak niečo - a potom by to priateľstvo mohlo vykvitnúť odtiaľ! Absolútne zbožňujem myšlienku týchto dvoch výdavkov na kvalitný čas BFF spoločne robiť malé, ale zábavné veci, ktoré Elsa nikdy nezažila ako dieťa.

| Why You Should be on Twitter<br/><br/>Disclaimer: I am not, nor have I ever claimed to be, a social media guru. I'm just a person who thinks about stuff a lot, and this has come up a number of times.<br/><br/>I'm not an early adopter. Sometimes it takes me years to figure out what I want to use something for before I actually get on it, and Twitter was one of those things. I've been on Twitter seriously since about February of this year, so I'm pretty new at it. Still, I've learned a number of things, and I wanted to share them. Some people say I'm a Twitter pusher, and I am, because there's lots of good reasons to get on it, and virtually no downsides.<br/><br/>So what's Twitter? If you're on the internet, you've probably at least heard of it. It's a social media network that serves as a forum for conversations, updates, and news in a medium more public than something like Facebook or LinkedIn. Facebook is about who wants to find you, but Twitter is about who you want to find. Your favourite writers, actors, politicians, singers, and scientists are probably on Twitter. So are your favourite charities, radio stations, news sites, and stores. And they want you to find them and listen to what they have to say. Everyone on Twitter, at least initially, wants to talk with you.<br/><br/>But why join that? Why be a part of it? There's all kinds of reasons, and I'm going to give you a few.<br/><br/>People and Places Twitter is a great way to find out about events which are going on around the world, but also in your community. If you're travelling and looking for things to do, it's a great way to find out about things relevant to your interests (because the people you follow are people you're interested in). Even if you're not travelling, knowing about great places to go locally or knowing that people you're interested in are going to them creates an opportunity to meet them and create a deeper relationship with them. If you go back to my party post, all the people in it but two, I heard about on Twitter and then met in real life, and now we're pretty good friends. And the more you do this, the more things you'll find out about, and the more people you'll meet. And if you follow them on Twitter, you already know a bit about what they're like. They want you to. The reverse is also true, because tweeting invites people to see what you're like, and they can make the same choices about you.<br/><br/>Inspiration and Motivation<br/>Inspiration comes from the strangest places, and the influx of tweets means there's always fresh content for your imagination. I have a follow first policy, so I'll follow just about anybody, and then periodically go through and unfollow people. I don't know who's going to plant the seed of a new blog post or new project in me, so I like to keep my options open. Motivation also happens, because Twitter is just like life. If you surround yourself with people who are ambitious, dedicated, generous, and hard-working, it's easier to be like that, and push yourself. It's easier to think that if they can plan events, launch projects, or just get up in the morning, well, so can you.<br/><br/>Learning and Lifestyle Bloggers are on Twitter. Bloggers who aren't may actually be crazy. And people blog about just about everything. If you're looking to learn something, odds are good that somebody's tweeting about it. On top of that, news services and stores are also connected, which means that you can get your news up to the minute, and find out about sales and deals as they start.As far as lifestyle, looking for new recipe ideas? Follow some caterers and see what they come up with. Need a twist for that cocktail party? Twitter's got people for that too. Wardrobe recommendations, or just want to see what other people are doing with their lives? It's all there.<br/><br/>There are some common challenges I face when talking about this, and they're legitimate obstacles. It can seem pretty daunting, especially if you're getting on the bandwagon late, like I did. I spent months following only two people and not knowing what else to do. But there are ways to overcome them, and hear they are from least frequent to most.<br/><br/>#3: Twitter is for Narcissistic Jerks<br/>I think this comes from the idea that most people tweet for and about themselves as a way of getting attention. What I don't get is why there's anything wrong with that, or why doing that makes one a narcissist or a jerk. If someone has something to say, they want to be heard. Used to be you'd stand on the street corner and yell. Now you can yell in 140 characters or less. Twitter's just a new way to be heard. Now, there are certainly narcissistic jerks on Twitter. They're pretty much everywhere. Sometimes, people are jerks. Sometimes one of those people is me, I'm sorry to say. Don't follow those people. If you don't like what someone is saying, whether that's points that they're making or detailed accounts of their bathroom activities, you don't have to listen on Twitter.<br/><br/>#2: I Can't Keep Track of It All<br/>The second obstacle people often bring up is that they just don't have time to keep track of all the things which are going on on Twitter. And you know what? That's fine. Keep track of what you can. Maybe you only wander on every few days. If you're a private user (rather than tweeting for your company), and especially a beginner, that's okay. Part of something is better than all of nothing.<br/><br/>#1 I've Got Nothing I Want to Put Out There<br/>This is by far the most frequent challenge people raise. And it doesn't even matter. You don't have to join Twitter to talk. Join it to listen. Again, your favourite authors, singers, bloggers, and newspapers are on here. This is your chance to listen to them. It's your chance to gain a window into their lives and activities, and they're inviting you to do that. Want to find out what Felicia Day is going to be up to at the San Diego Comic Con? Done. I know people who only listen on Twitter, and that's great. That's what I did for a while. Eventually, maybe you'll find something to tweet about, or make something to tweet about. I hope you do, because I want to hear about it.<br/><br/>In short, if you're not using Twitter, I think you should be. If you're not using it to its full extent, try to. Don't be afraid to follow five hundred people, if all of those people are saying things you're interested in. Invite those people into bits of your life, and see how it's improved by the interaction. I look forward to hearing from you. | Prečo by ste mali byť na Twitteri<br/><br/>Disclaimer: Nie som, ani som nikdy netvrdil, že som, guru sociálnych médií. Som len človek, ktorý veľa premýšľa o veciach, a to sa objavilo niekoľkokrát.<br/><br/>Nie som skorý osvojiteľ. Niekedy mi trvá roky, kým zistím, na čo chcem niečo použiť predtým, ako sa na to skutočne dostanem, a Twitter bol jednou z tých vecí. Na Twitteri som vážne od februára tohto roka, takže som v tom celkom nový. Napriek tomu som sa naučil veľa vecí a chcel som sa o ne podeliť. Niektorí ľudia hovoria, že som Twitter pusher, a ja som, pretože existuje veľa dobrých dôvodov, aby sa na to, a prakticky žiadne nevýhody.<br/><br/>Takže čo je Twitter? Ak ste na internete, pravdepodobne ste o tom aspoň počuli. Je to sociálna sieť, ktorá slúži ako fórum pre rozhovory, aktualizácie a správy v médiách, ktoré sú viac verejné ako niečo ako Facebook alebo LinkedIn. Facebook je o tom, kto vás chce nájsť, ale Twitter je o tom, koho chcete nájsť. Vaši obľúbení spisovatelia, herci, politici, speváci a vedci sú pravdepodobne na Twitteri. Takže sú vaše obľúbené charity, rozhlasové stanice, spravodajské stránky a obchody. A chcú, aby ste ich našli a počúvali, čo hovoria. Každý na Twitteri, aspoň spočiatku, s vami chce hovoriť.<br/><br/>Ale prečo sa k tomu pridať? Prečo byť toho súčasťou? Existuje veľa dôvodov, a ja vám dám pár.<br/><br/>Twitter je skvelý spôsob, ako sa dozvedieť o udalostiach, ktoré sa dejú po celom svete, ale aj vo vašej komunite. Ak cestujete a hľadáte veci, ktoré máte robiť, je to skvelý spôsob, ako sa dozvedieť o veciach, ktoré sú relevantné pre vaše záujmy (pretože ľudia, ktorých sledujete, sú ľudia, o ktorých sa zaujímate). Aj keď nie ste na cestách, vedieť o skvelých miestach, kam ísť lokálne, alebo vedieť, že ľudia, o ktorých máte záujem, sa k nim dostanú, vytvára príležitosť stretnúť sa s nimi a vytvoriť s nimi hlbší vzťah. Ak sa vrátite na moju stranícku poštu, všetci ľudia v nej okrem dvoch, počul som o Twitteri a potom som sa stretol v reálnom živote, a teraz sme dosť dobrí priatelia. A čím viac to urobíte, tým viac vecí sa dozviete a tým viac ľudí stretnete. A ak ich sledujete na Twitteri, už viete trochu o tom, aké sú. Chcú, aby ste. Opačná je tiež pravda, pretože tweeting pozýva ľudí, aby videli, aké ste, a môžu o vás urobiť rovnaké rozhodnutia.<br/><br/>Inšpirácia a motivácia<br/>Inšpirácia pochádza z najzvláštnejších miest a príliv tweetov znamená, že je tu vždy čerstvý obsah pre vašu predstavivosť. Mám prvú politiku, takže budem sledovať takmer každého a potom pravidelne prechádzať a sledovať ľudí. Neviem, kto vo mne zasadí semeno nového blogu alebo nového projektu, takže rád nechávam svoje možnosti otvorené. Motivácia sa tiež stáva, pretože Twitter je ako život. Ak sa obklopíte ľuďmi, ktorí sú ambiciózni, oddaní, veľkorysí a pracovití, je ľahšie byť takýto a tlačiť sa. Je ľahšie si myslieť, že ak môžu plánovať udalosti, spúšťať projekty, alebo len vstávať ráno, tak môžete aj vy.<br/><br/>Učenie a životný štýl Blogeri sú na Twitteri. Blogeri, ktorí nie sú v skutočnosti môže byť blázon. A ľudia blog o takmer všetko. Ak sa snažíte niečo naučiť, šance sú dobré, že niekto o tom tweetuje. Okrem toho, spravodajské služby a obchody sú tiež pripojené, čo znamená, že môžete dostať svoje správy až do minúty, a dozvedieť sa o predajoch a obchodoch, ako začnú. Pokiaľ ide o životný štýl, hľadáte nové nápady receptov? Sledujte niektoré cateringy a uvidíte, čo prídu s. Potrebujete twist pre ten koktail party? Twitter má ľudí na to taky. Šatník odporúčania, alebo len chcete vidieť, čo ostatní ľudia robia so svojimi životmi? Je to všetko tam.<br/><br/>Existujú niektoré bežné výzvy, ktorým čelím, keď o tom hovorím, a sú to legitímne prekážky. Môže sa to zdať dosť skľučujúce, najmä ak sa dostanete do rozbehnutého vlaku neskoro, ako som to urobil ja. Strávil som mesiace sledovaním iba dvoch ľudí a nevedel som, čo mám robiť. Ale existujú spôsoby, ako ich prekonať a počuť, že sú od najmenej častého až po väčšinu.<br/><br/># 3: Twitter je pre narcistických blbcov<br/>Myslím, že to pochádza z myšlienky, že väčšina ľudí tweet pre seba a o sebe ako spôsob, ako získať pozornosť. Čo nechápem, je, prečo je na tom niečo zlé, alebo prečo to robí jeden narcista alebo blbec. Ak má niekto čo povedať, chce byť vypočutý. Kedysi ste stáli na rohu ulice a kričali. Teraz môžete kričať 140 znakov alebo menej. Twitter je len nový spôsob, ako byť vypočutý. Teraz sú určite narcistické blbce na Twitteri. Niekedy sú ľudia hlupáci, niekedy som jedným z nich ja, je mi ľúto, že to musím povedať. Ak sa vám nepáči, čo niekto hovorí, či už sú to body, ktoré robia, alebo podrobné účty ich kúpeľňových aktivít, nemusíte počúvať na Twitteri.<br/><br/>#2 Nedokážem si to všetko udržať<br/>Druhou prekážkou, ktorú ľudia často vyvolávajú, je to, že jednoducho nemajú čas sledovať všetky veci, ktoré sa deje na Twitteri. A viete čo? To je v poriadku. Majte prehľad o tom, čo môžete. Možno len blúdite každých pár dní. Ak ste súkromný používateľ (namiesto tweetovania pre vašu spoločnosť) a najmä začiatočník, je to v poriadku. Časť niečoho je lepšia ako všetko z ničoho.<br/><br/>#1 Nemám nič, čo by som tam chcel dať<br/>Toto je zďaleka najčastejšia výzva, ktorú ľudia vyvolávajú. A ani na tom nezáleží. Nemusíte sa pripojiť k Twitteru, aby ste mohli hovoriť. Pripojte sa k nemu, aby ste si ju vypočuli. Opäť tu sú vaši obľúbení autori, speváci, blogeri a noviny. Toto je vaša šanca počúvať ich. Je to vaša šanca získať okno do ich životov a aktivít, a oni vás pozývajú, aby ste to urobili. Chcete zistiť, čo Felicia Day bude robiť na San Diego Comic Con? Hotovo. Poznám ľudí, ktorí počúvajú len na Twitteri, a to je skvelé. To je to, čo som urobil na chvíľu. Nakoniec možno nájdete niečo, o čom môžete tweetovať, alebo urobiť niečo, o čom tweetujete. Dúfam, že áno, pretože o tom chcem počuť.<br/><br/>Stručne povedané, ak nepoužívate Twitter, myslím, že by ste mali byť. Ak ho nepoužívate v plnom rozsahu, skúste to. Nebojte sa sledovať päťsto ľudí, ak všetci títo ľudia hovoria veci, ktoré vás zaujímajú. Pozvite týchto ľudí do vášho života a uvidíte, ako sa zlepší interakciou. Teším sa na vás. |
| Root Canals<br/><br/>The very thought of getting a root canal puts most people on edge. SCM Dental utilizes the latest technology and technique to make a root canal a virtually pain free and low stress procedure.<br/><br/>Rotary endodontics is an advanced technology and technique to perform endodontic treatment, the clinical term for a root canalThe term "root canal" refers to the natural cavity at the center of the tooth. The tooth's nerve is located in soft tissue (pulp) inside the root canal. If the tooth is damaged either by trauma or decay, debris can enter the sensitive root canal area and cause an infection, or in extreme circumstances, and abscess. An abscessed tooth is very serious and should be treated as an emergency, as it can create an infection that may spread to other parts of the body. If you believe you have an abscessed tooth, contact our office immediately to schedule emergency care.<br/><br/>Depending on the case, root canal therapy may require more than one visit. An initial x-ray will be taken to evaluate the tooth and root canal and determine the extent of the damage and infection if present. You will be given a form of anesthesia to make you relaxed.<br/><br/>When the area is numb, our dentist will create an access chamber to the root canal using an electric handpiece. Next, the root canal will be scraped of the infected or damaged tissue and nerve. Once the entire area has been throughly cleaned and polished, the tooth will be filled with a biocompatible rubber compound called gutta percha. The tooth is then covered with a dental filling or dental crown to restore strength and function.<br/><br/>Endodontic therapy has a bad reputation as being a painful procedure. With rotary endodontics, a root canal procedure is no more painful than having a dental filling placed. The infection and damage to the nerve is what creates the extreme pain and discomfort and patients you will experience significant relief after undergoing root canal therapy. Root canals have a success rate of 95% and allow people to preserve their natural teeth. | Koreňové kanály<br/><br/>Samotná myšlienka na získanie koreňového kanálika stavia väčšinu ľudí na okraj. SCM Dental využíva najnovšiu technológiu a techniku, aby sa koreňový kanál prakticky bezbolestný a nízky stres.<br/><br/>Rotačná endodoncia je pokročilá technológia a technika na vykonanie endodontického ošetrenia, klinický termín pre koreňový kanál. Termín "koreňový kanál" sa vzťahuje na prirodzenú dutinu v strede zuba. Nerv zuba sa nachádza v mäkkých tkanivách (pulp) vo vnútri koreňového kanálika. Ak je zub poškodený buď traumou alebo kazom, nečistoty môžu vstúpiť do oblasti citlivých koreňových kanálikov a spôsobiť infekciu alebo za extrémnych okolností a absces. Abscesovaný zub je veľmi vážny a mal by sa považovať za núdzový, pretože môže vytvoriť infekciu, ktorá sa môže rozšíriť do iných častí tela. Ak si myslíte, že máte abscesovaný zub, okamžite kontaktujte našu kanceláriu, aby ste naplánovali pohotovostnú starostlivosť.<br/><br/>V závislosti od prípadu môže liečba koreňových kanálikov vyžadovať viac ako jednu návštevu. Na vyhodnotenie zubného a koreňového kanálika a určenie rozsahu poškodenia a infekcie, ak je prítomná, sa vykoná počiatočný x-ray. Dostanete formu anestézie, aby ste sa uvoľnili.<br/><br/>Keď je oblasť znecitlivená, náš zubár vytvorí prístupovú komoru ku koreňovému kanáliku pomocou elektrického násadca. Ďalej sa koreňový kanál zoškrabe z infikovaného alebo poškodeného tkaniva a nervu. Akonáhle je celá oblasť bola dôkladne vyčistené a leštené, zub bude naplnený biokompatibilné gumy zlúčeniny s názvom guta percha. Zub je potom pokrytá zubné výplne alebo zubné korunky obnoviť silu a funkciu.<br/><br/>Endodontická terapia má zlú povesť ako bolestivý postup. Pri rotačnej endodoncii nie je postup koreňového kanálika bolestivejší ako umiestnenie zubnej výplne. Infekcia a poškodenie nervu je to, čo vytvára extrémnu bolesť a nepohodlie a pacienti po absolvovaní liečby koreňových kanálikov zažijú výraznú úľavu. Koreňové kanáliky majú úspešnosť 95% a umožňujú ľuďom zachovať si svoje prirodzené zuby. |
| Churchyard Bottom Wood<br/><br/>Highgate<br/><br/>Churchyard Bottom Wood, Highgate<br/><br/>Now called Queen's Wood<br/><br/>Between 1860 and 1880 the centre was torn out of the City of London to build sewers, railways and new roads. Houses were demolished without regard for the tenants who had to find whatever accommodation they could elsewhere. Managers went to livo in Kensington and St. John's Wood, while the poorest crowded into the rookeries like Seven Dials and Lisson Grove. For those between, the clerks and skilled workmen, speculative builders put up row after row of terraced villas and Mr Pooter moved into Holloway. The people of Muswell Hill watched houses creep across the fields of Finsbury Park, up Crouch Hill and down the other side, so that by 1880, Crouch End was being developed and there seemed no way to stem the flow. Ten years later the large estates of Muswell Hill were being sold. Upton Farm was sold and the Ecclesiastical Commissioners wanted to develop Churchyard Bottom Wood, now called Queen's Wood. The story would have made an Ibsen play. Two groups of honest, highly motivated people fighting for what they each thought was right. The Ecclesiastical Commissioners on the one hand and the Committee of the Hornsey Charities on the other, both believed they were doing their best for other people, and the public rose against them both in indignation<br/><br/>At that time Muswell Hill Road was a country road, with Southwood Hall at one end and Upton Farm at the other. By 1894, Onslow Gardens was built, Connaught Gardens marked out, and builders were poised to develop the Woodlands estate. Cut out of Churchyard Bottom Wood was a group of tumble-down cottages, on a triangular site. An undated map, held by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners shows six Wasteland Cottages with an opening between them - not a road, not metalled, but a way through to the strawberry beds behind. Further along was another gap which led to footpaths through the wood. These two openings were to be the basis of the plan. The same two gaps and the cleared ground, which was the strawberry field, can be seen in the 1894 map below. They are shown as 'Muswell Hill Cottages' and, quite in passing, Peter Sellers was to live on the same site much later on. To develop the wood as a housing estate, the Commissioners needed to drive two roads through from Muswell Hill Road and build houses along them. The Muswell Hill Road frontage alone would not have provided room for enough houses to make the venture worthwhile.<br/><br/>The land and cottages had been given much earlier as almshouses to house old people and were held on their behalf by the Trustees of the Hornsey Charity Commissioners. By the 1890s the cottages were tumble-down, in need of major repair. Public-spirited, wishing to do the best for their old tenants, the Trustees could not improve them since they had no money. Some years before the Ecclesiastical Commissioners had planned to develop Gravel Pit Wood (now Highgate Wood) as a housing estate, but this had met such opposition that they backed down. Instead, in 1886, they gave all 69 acres woodland to the public. At the same time they offered to sell Churchyard Bottom Wood to Hornsey Urban District Council for £25,000, but this was too much for Hornsey to raise on its own. The Council said that people living outside Hornsey also enjoyed the wood and other authorities should help, but no help was given. In the end the offer fell into abeyance.<br/><br/>Map showing the Muswell Hill Cottages which were the centre of the controversy.<br/><br/>Muswell Hill Road about 1880<br/><br/>It seems probable that these three pairs of cottages<br/>were the ones at the centre of the dispute.<br/><br/>The Ecclesiastical Commissioners wanted to raise money for its church work in Britain and abroad. They considered that they had been given the land to be used for the propogat­ion of religion and if this meant selling off land or woods, it was a lesser evil than restricting the work of the church. They had given Gravel Pit Wood to the public: in its place they would develop Churchyard Bottom Wood.<br/><br/>The Trustees of the Hornsey Charities wanted to produce an income to help their poor people, so they made an offer to the Commissioners. Their triangular piece of land was too awkwardly shaped to be developed economically, but if the Commissioners would grant them some more land to make it into a square site, they would build twenty-five neat villas. These would bring in ground rents of £225 per annum, which could be used to relieve the poverty of Hornsey people. In return they would permit the Commission­ers to cut two roads through their land so that the Commissioners could develop the woods.<br/><br/>When this offer became known people immediately reacted with alarm.<br/><br/>On the 16th December 1893 Mr Carvell Williams MP asked in the House of Commons, if the Ecclesiastical Commissioners had consented to sell a strip of land to the Hornsey Charities Trustees on condition that an existing road be widened to 40 feet, whether this was a preliminary to a building scheme and if the House of Parliament would have an opportunity to express an opinion.<br/><br/>Mr Leveson Gower, a Church Estates Commissioner replied',"Yes" to the first part.<br/><br/>Mr Carvell Williams, "Do I understand it is the intention to destroy that portion of Highgate Woods by building on it?"<br/><br/>Two days later The Star published an article worthy of any modern tabloid.<br/><br/>The Star<br/>18th December 1893<br/><br/>'Parliament must keep a keen watch on those old vandals and confederates of the jerry-builder the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. They are always alienating some piece of land or are favouring the builders as opposed to the general public. The Commissioners would not sell the Churchyard Bottom wood to the ratepayers but now propose 'to open it up' by cutting two wide roads through it in connection with one of their numerous building schemes. Will not someone ask a question in Parliament and check the brick and mortar policy of the Commissioners?'<br/><br/>By the time this was printed, the question had been asked and the answer was either untrue, or devious. Other papers took up the story. The Times, in a long report, said that the Comnussioners were not prepared to give an undertaking that Parliament, or any other public body, should have an opportunity of considering any scheme for building on the site of the wood.<br/><br/>The situation simmered for eighteen months until the Ecclesiastical Commissioners were forced to open an enquiry, which began at Highgate on 31 May 1895, chaired by an Assistant Ecclesiastical Commissioner. The Inquiry produced a flurry of newspaper letters of which this was the most important.<br/><br/>The Daily Chronicle, 5 June 1895<br/><br/>VANDALISM AT HIGHGATE<br/><br/>Sir –<br/><br/>One of the most lovely bits of woodland in suburan London is threatened. Will you help us to ward off what would be a calamity, not only to the immediate district, but to the whole of densely-populated North London? In no part of the metropolis has the builder been more active than in Crouch End and Hornsey. The beautiful meadows of a year or two ago are now houses and shops. Ballast heaps have taken the place of stately elms and chestnuts, and once pleasant villages are sharing the fate of Stroud Green, Harringay, Finsbury Park, Highbury and Islington. ---<br/><br/>---- The object is the construction of two forty-foot roads through the woods. We in this district know the meaning of forty-foot roads through woods. It means that the woods are doomed. Ten years ago agitation saved the sister-wood of sixty-five acres - The Gravel Pit Woods - and no one who saw the Bank Holiday crowds flocking up the Archway Road from the dreary streets of Holloway, Islington and Clerkenwell, and watched the keen enjoyment of the children and family parties picnicking on the grass and among the trees, could fail to realise the immense boon that the grant by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners of this wood has been to the whole of North London, but the Lower Wood of sixty acres has always been regarded as a natural complement of the other. ----<br/><br/>--- The Ecclesiastical Commissioners own nearly one-third of the large parish of Hornsey. By the liberal expenditure of the ratepayers' money in the opening up of roads and the general development of the district, the value of their property has been enormously increased, and from this unearned increment they each year draw large revenues. Surely the ratepayers whose money has thus aided in creating the immense estate may expect liberal treatment in return. ---<br/><br/>Yours obediently,<br/><br/>Signed by The Vicar of St James', Muswell Hill, the Minister of Park Chapel, Crouch End, a barrister living in Onslow Gardens and three members of the District Council.<br/><br/>It was a shot right across the bows of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. Their own religious leaders and the District Council, all up in arms saying in effect that the church was too rich and should be charitable, not greedy. The inclusion of the two clergymen was a shrewd move. Remember to that this was still in the height of the Darwin controversy. Darwin had split belief in the teachings of the Church and many people would have resented the power of the Church from that point of view alone. The Church was not so secure as it pretended to be.<br/><br/>The Evening News, 7 June 1895 said:-<br/><br/>"If the Ecclesiastical Comnussioners are not tackled at once, the building octopus will get a grip of the wood which will be very difficult to loosen later on, ---. Therefore it behoves Londoners to be up and doing if they would save one of their most delightful bits of rustic scenery. The public inquiry stands adjourned to Thursday next, and before then something must be done to convince the Commissioners that the citizens of London will not tolerate the confiscation of one of their favourite playgrounds."<br/><br/>A letter in the Daily Chronicle the next day said:-<br/><br/>.... It was with great relief that that the residents, some ten years ago, heard that the purchase of the Upper Wood had been effected; and how delightful a boon this has proved, anyone who visited them can testify, but all who exerted themselves to save these upper woods, which lie on the west side of Muswell Hill road, felt that their victory was incomplete so long as the sixty acres on the east side remained in danger. It is, as it were, an accident that the woods are divided by a broad high road. Can anyone doubt what the effect would be if the Churchyard Bottom Wood were replaced by rows of small villas, each sending out its contribution of smoke and soot? Can anyone doubt, too, the serious difference it would make to the picturesque setting of the purchased woods if a line of staring new houses were to be run up right over against their leafy frontage?'<br/><br/>This expressed the opinions of many people. In fact, the Gravel Pit Wood, which the writer calls the 'Upper Wood', had not been purchased, but given to the district by the Ecclesiastical Commission, a point they were to reiterate time and again over the years, but most people ignored it. The Commission was not going to give away a second wood whatever anyone said, and held this position to the end.<br/><br/>H.S.Chamberlain, of 5 Cranley Gardens,<br/>in a letter to the Times dated June 8, 1895, urged purchase.<br/><br/>I know that it is common to speak harshly of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, but as the trustees of a fund they are bound to administer it to the greatest advantage, and therefore, if anything is to be done to save the demolition of the wood, it appears to me that it can only be effected by the purchase of the property from the Comnussioners, who I know, are fully alive to the protection of free and open spaces for the people, and who, I feel sure, would be disposed to treat the matter of a purchase in a free and liberal spirit, as they have already done in the matter of the Shepherd's Cot-field, by granting a lease to the Crouch End Playing-fields Company - a small company in which I own a few shares, a small company which was formed exclusively for the purpose of securing the fields for cricket, tennis etc.<br/><br/>(This refers the the Crouch End Playing Fields which had been secured a few years later.)<br/><br/>As Chairman of the Muswell Hill Conservative Association, I am constantly in touch with the inhabitants, and I can safely affirm that every person resident in the neighbourhood would do anything in reason to preserve.<br/><br/>(All he wanted personally was Charity income to support his poor people. He demanded his acre of land - not a great deal surely - he believed the Commissioners' assurance that the wood was not in danger.)<br/><br/>' Muswell Hill Road was one of the best in Hornsey and would remain equally beautiful, houses or no houses',<br/><br/>(and then came the great rhetorical flourish.)<br/><br/>'Are the poor to suffer because of the sentimental objections and the hysterical cry of 'wolf just raised by your correspondents? Something must be done and that soon. An acre of back-land added to the charity-estate would make no apprec­iable difference to the land remaining, while the profit derived from it would succour many poor old and deserving persons in their declining years and enable us to hand over to our successors an estate which in the distant future would be of great value in the rendering of charitable aid to the deserving poor of the parish of Hornsey.'<br/><br/>Reading his letter one senses hysteria very near the surface. Why did he think the Commissioners wanted to build a road? Why should they spend all that money if not to build houses? He never seemed to realise that for an acre of land the the whole wood would be lost. But he had been with the problem for a long time. He was the person to whom the Commissioners had made the offer of sale for £25,000 years before and it is his name which is honoured in a plaque on Crouch End Clock Tower for saving the wood, but his trust in the Ecclesiastical Commissioners seems naive. It is sad that at the Inquiry he was to be cast as the devil.<br/><br/>The Inquiry Continued<br/><br/>The adjourned opened in Highgate on 15 June 1895. Expecting a large gather­ing, the Council Chamber had been changed completely. The usual tables had been removed and the room filled with chairs. By half past seven the room was crowded, with people jostling for seats.<br/><br/>Mr Murray, the Commissioner, said the Inquiry was really a simple one. Hornsey Parochial Charities wished to purchase a piece of land adjoining their charity property at the back. The question was whether the Charity Commission, which controlled all charities, had enough power to stop them. The Church Commissioners were prepared to sell the land at very favourable terms and the income of the Charity would be very considerable increased.<br/><br/>Against this there were three classes of objection.<br/><br/>The original Trust was for the purpose of providing cottages for the Poor, but the trustees were proposing to build villas which would be too expensive for the Poor. However, it was within the power of the Trustees to vary the terms of the Trust, so they could build villas if they thought that the Poor would benefit in the end. The poor people themselves might object, but liberal provisions had already been promised for them. The third objection related to the aesthetic and public side of the question. He took it from what he had read that the Charity Commission ought to interfere to prevent the Ecclesiastical Commissioners from exercising their own discretion in dealing with their own property.<br/><br/>The Inquiry discussed fine points, but the speakers kept coming back to the major problem of preventing any destruction of the wood. The Vestry Clerk of Islington, representing 300,000 people, made a formal protest about any part of the wood, so valuable for the people of Islington and Hornsey being used for private purposes. Mr Wilfred White said that if the Commissioners would give them time they would be able to raise the money to compensate the Trustees.<br/><br/>Mr Beaumont said they did not want villas, they wanted cottages for poor people who were being driven out of the district. Others said that there was no money to build cottages to replace the present delapidated ones but villas would be an economic proposition. Others retorted that there were score of villas to let in Highgate. The Wood was sacred. Stick to the question of the Wood.<br/><br/>Dr Fletcher said the cry among the working people was that there was nowhere to go. Working people came to him with the cry, "We are driven out of Highgate and are obliged to go to Highgate New Town." If the Muswell Hill Road frontage was sold there was no question but that roads might be cut right through the woods in the direction of Hornsey, but if the Commissioners could not get the land from the Charity Commission they could not cut the road.<br/><br/>He was very sure the cottages could be put into a fit state of repair. He was asked by the poor people, by the police and by a number of the working classes to represent these two points, that cottage accommodation was very sorely needed in Highgate and that if they once allowed the land to be sold, there was no telling where the hand of the builder would be stayed.<br/><br/>(Loud and prolonged cheers).<br/><br/>Numerous other people spoke and the Comnussioner summed up by saying that he took it that the prevailing opinion was in favour of retaining the cottages but the meeting should draw no conclusions from what he had said (Groans).<br/><br/>Others said that the Trustees of the Charity had failed in their duties by letting the the cottages fall into disrepair.<br/><br/>Mr H.R.Williams, the Trustee who had written to the paper earlier, said that he had it on the best authority that the Church Commissioners would make no roads whatever and they would not be benefitted one iota by the actions of the Charity Commissioners. Others were far less trusting and the meeting closed after nearly three hours.<br/><br/>'We are faced with the fact that in Highgate and Muswell Hill there are a number of persons who want the Churchyard Bottom Wood and will not be happy until they have got it - while nobody appears willing to spend a farthing to pay for it. Everyone says it would be a fine thing to have the wood as open space, but everybody thinks it is the duty of someone else to make it one. The Islington Vestry has 'resolved' on the subject, but the Islington Vestry does not offer a penny piece towards the purchase. --- There is no more difficult problem for the community or the individual to solve than how to gain possession of other people's property without paying for it.'<br/><br/>Paying for it was indeed the problem as Churchyard Bottom Wood became the subject of intense local and national debate. A joint committee was formed to raise money to save the wood. On 20 November 1896, C.F.Cory-Wright, Hon Treasurer, wrote to The Standard, a daily paper at that time, appealing for help. He reminded everyone of the danger of losing the wood and said it could only be saved by buying it. The Church Commissioners would sell for £25,000 and an extra (5,000 would be required for fencing and drainage, making a total of £30,000. This was too much for Hornsey Council to raise but they had already voted £10,000 towards the total. The woods were of inestimable value to all of North London so he appealed to public bodies and private people to raise the remaining £20,000. He warned that the present offer from the Church Commissioners was open only to the end of 1898. After that the builders would move in.<br/><br/>The appeal was warmly welcomed by the press. A Private Bill was rushed through Parliament and the Highgate Woods Preservation Act, 1897, became law. The Conunittee now had the right to advertise for contributions towards buying the Wood and preserving it.<br/><br/>In a fairly short time almost all the money was raised, but the last few thousand proved very difficult to raise and the Commissioners' deadline was a matter of weeks away. Mr Cory-Wright wrote pleading for more time but was granted a mere three months and then only if interest at 4 per cent was paid for the extra period on the full sum. In the end the London County Council, which had originally offered £2,500, made this up to £5,000 and the total was reached, but it was a close-run thing.<br/><br/>The Council decided to re-name the Wood as 'Queen's Woods' in honour of Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee and Hornsey put on a fine display of bunting when the Duchess of Albany formally declared the Wood open 'for the free use of the public for ever'.<br/><br/>While the campaign to save Churchyard Bottom Wood was run and directed by local people who felt passionately about this particular piece of woodland, they called on the help and experience of a vast network of people, some of whom had worked together on similar campaigns for over thirty years. The Committee issued an appeal, printed on very good quality paper and bearing some famous names.<br/><br/>The questions of open space and public health were major subjects of the Victorian vision.<br/><br/>The Open Spaces Movement<br/><br/>Octavia Hill, the great housing reformer, who had begun with three old houses in Marylebone, bought for her by Jolm Ruskin, had quickly become an expert on housing poor people in the healthiest conditions possible. Her way was to buy leases and then knock down some of the crowded houses in order to bring light and air to the rest, believing that fresh air and sunlight were the the only way poor people could be saved from 'putrid fever. She had learnt this as a child from her grandfather, Southwood Smith, who developed his theories at the Fever Hospital at King's Cross.<br/><br/>He had built the first Industrial Dwellings for poor people and had proved statistically that good air and decent drainage saved lives. Gibson Gardens, in Northwold Road, is a direct outcome of Southwood Smith's ideas. More Information on Gibson Gardens<br/><br/>The Importance of Open Air<br/><br/>Open spaces and the opportunity to breathe clean air, were essential for people living in one or two crowded rooms. Octavia Hill took her charges from the Lisson Grove slums, up Fitzjohn's Avenue to Hampstead Heath. She so loved the Fitzjohn's Avenue fields that she tried to buy them as a public park. They were to cost £10,000 and within three August weeks £8,500 had been raised. It needed only the end of the summer holidays and the return from holiday of sympathetic friends and the further £1,500 would have been raised, but the owners suddenly withdrew their offer. Despite all pleading, the fields were covered with large houses.<br/><br/>From this developed the campaign to save Parliament Hill, the next open space northwards from Lisson Grove, buying up fields in the path of the builders to make a permanent cordon sanitalre against the advancing bricks. The Parliament Hill Fields campaign was so successful that the Hampstead Heath Bill was passed and there was money over from the appeal. From this money and the impetus towards open spaces, was to develop the National Trust. Octavia Hill had been interested in protecting areas like Church Bottom Wood for years, so she was a natural ally in the fight to save the Wood.<br/><br/>The Commons Preservation Society also, was familiar with this kind of agitation and money collection. They had torn down fencing when lords of the manor had enclosed pieces of common land, leading both legal and illegal battles against the arrogant privatization of land traditionally free. Robert Hunter, their Honorary Solicitor from 1868, was always concerned with securing open spaces, large or small, for the public. He, now Sir Robert Hunter, became the Chairman of the Church Bottom Appeal. The Chairman of the Commons Preservation Society was Mr Shaw-Lefevre MP (later Lord Eversley) who played a big part in this and other campaigns in the House of Commons. Octavia Hill had been involved in their work from about 1875.<br/><br/>At the same time Octavia Hill was campaigning for a Burials Bill.<br/><br/>City churchyards had become so full and such a serious a hazard to health, by contaminating wells from which people drew their drinking water, that City burials were no longer permitted. Instead, cemetries were created on the outskirts of town. Abney Park Cemetary was one of these. There was then a movement to remove the headstones to the edges of the old town cemetries, re-inter the bodies elsewhere and turn the cemetries into gardens and open spaces, instead of building on them. This land in the centre of London was very valuable and speculators were avid to obtain it: Even the Quakers had built over one of their cemetries and threatened to do so again by building over Bunhill Fields. Octavia Hill had a network of allies in a dozen fields, so her help to save the Church Bottom Wood must have been invaluable.<br/><br/>The Metropolitan Gardens Society, set up in 1882, had laid out about two hundred small gardens in city centres by 1890. They later handed them over to the Local Authorities, so their support for the Churchyard Bottom Wood Appeal was assured from the start.<br/><br/>The Kyrle Society is forgotten now, but in its day had great influence on Town Planning and Open Space legislation. The Society had been set up about 1875 for 'the Diffusion of Beauty', to bring colour and interest into the lives of people living in dull, drab surroundings. Bright colour to walls and decoration, good singing, open spaces, Nature, Literature and Art. All these fell within the Society's remit. There was a Decorative Branch, for whom William Morris lectured; a Musical Branch to promote choirs and Happy Evenings for people in local school buildings; and a Literature Branch. The Society appealed regularly by letters in The Times, to 'the richer classes' for books and periodicals to be distributed to boys' and girls' clubs, almshouses and elsewhere. However the Open Spaces Committee was the most active. The very name 'Kyrle' came from Pope's The Man of Ross, the philanthropist who gave his birthplace to the people as a public park. | Churchyard Dno Drevo<br/><br/>Highgate<br/><br/>Churchyard Bottom Wood v destinácii Highgate<br/><br/>názov titulu Queen's Wood<br/><br/>V rokoch 1860 až 1880 bolo centrum vytrhnuté z City of London na výstavbu kanalizácie, železníc a nových ciest. Domy boli zbúrané bez ohľadu na nájomníkov, ktorí museli nájsť akékoľvek ubytovanie, ktoré mohli inde. Manažéri išli na livo v Kensingtone a St. John's Wood, zatiaľ čo najchudobnejší sa natlačili do rookeries ako Seven Dials a Lisson Grove. Pre tých medzi úradníkmi a zručných robotníkov, špekulatívnych staviteľov postavili rad za radom terasovitých víl a pán Pooter sa presťahoval do Holloway. Obyvatelia Muswell Hillu sledovali, ako sa domy plazia po poliach Finsbury Parku, hore Crouch Hill a dole na druhej strane, takže do roku 1880 sa vyvíjal Crouch End a zdalo sa, že neexistuje žiadny spôsob, ako zastaviť tok. O desať rokov neskôr boli predané veľké pozemky Muswell Hill. Upton Farm bol predaný a cirkevní komisári chceli vyvinúť Churchyard Bottom Wood, teraz nazývaný Queen's Wood. Príbeh by bol Ibsenovou hrou. Dve skupiny úprimných, vysoko motivovaných ľudí bojujúcich za to, čo si mysleli, že je správne. Cirkevní komisári na jednej strane a Výbor pre charitu Hornsey na druhej strane verili, že robia to najlepšie pre iných ľudí a verejnosť proti nim povstala v rozhorčení.<br/><br/>V tej dobe Muswell Hill Road bola vidiecka cesta, s Southwood Hall na jednom konci a Upton Farm na druhom konci. 1894, Onslow Gardens bol postavený, Connaught Gardens označené, a stavitelia boli pripravení rozvíjať Woodlands Estate. Vyrezané z Churchyard Bottom Wood bola skupina zrútených chatiek, na trojuholníkovom mieste. Na nedatovanej mape, ktorú majú cirkevní komisári, je zobrazených šesť chatrčí pustatiny s otvorom medzi nimi - nie cesta, ktorá nie je rozmetaná, ale cesta k jahodovým lôžkam za nimi. Ďalej bola ďalšia medzera, ktorá viedla k chodníkom cez drevo. Tieto dva otvory mali byť základom plánu. Rovnaké dve medzery a vyčistená pôda, ktorá bola jahodové pole, možno vidieť na mape 1894 nižšie. Sú zobrazené ako "Muswell Hill Cottages" a celkom mimochodom, Peter Sellers mal žiť na rovnakom mieste oveľa neskôr. Na rozvoj dreva ako sídliska komisári potrebovali prejsť dve cesty z Muswell Hill Road a postaviť domy pozdĺž nich. Samotná fasáda Muswell Hill Road by neposkytla dostatok domov, aby sa podnik oplatil.<br/><br/>Pôda a chaty boli dané oveľa skôr ako almužny na bývanie starých ľudí a boli držané v ich mene správcami Hornsey Charity Commissioners. Do roku 1890 sa chaty zrútili a potrebovali veľkú opravu. Verejnosť, ktorá si želala robiť to najlepšie pre svojich starých nájomníkov, ich nemohla zlepšiť, pretože nemali peniaze. Niekoľko rokov predtým, ako cirkevní komisári plánovali vybudovať štrkové drevo (teraz Highgate Wood) ako sídlisko, ale to sa stretlo s takou opozíciou, že ustúpili. Namiesto toho v roku 1886 dali verejnosti všetkých 69 akrov lesov. Zároveň ponúkli, že predajú Churchyard Bottom Wood mestskej rade Hornsey za 25 000 libier, ale to bolo pre Hornsey príliš veľa na to, aby sa zvýšili sami. Rada povedala, že ľudia žijúci mimo Hornsey sa tiež tešili z dreva a iné orgány by mali pomôcť, ale žiadna pomoc nebola poskytnutá. Nakoniec ponuka upadla do opovrhnutia.<br/><br/>Mapa znázorňujúca Muswell Hill Cottages, ktoré boli stredobodom sporu.<br/><br/>Muswell Hill Road okolo roku 1880<br/><br/>Zdá sa pravdepodobné, že tieto tri páry chalupy boli v centre sporu.<br/><br/>Cirkevní komisári chceli získať peniaze na svoju cirkevnú prácu v Británii a v zahraničí. Domnievali sa, že im bola daná pôda, ktorá mala byť použitá na podporu náboženstva, a ak to znamenalo predaj pôdy alebo lesov, bolo to menšie zlo ako obmedzenie práce cirkvi. Verejnosti dali štrkové jamkové drevo: na jeho mieste sa vyvinie Churchyard Bottom Wood.<br/><br/>Správcovia charitatívnych organizácií Hornsey chceli priniesť príjem na pomoc svojim chudobným ľuďom, a tak predložili komisárom ponuku. Ich trojuholníkový pozemok bol príliš nešikovne tvarovaný na to, aby bol ekonomicky rozvinutý, ale ak by im komisári poskytli viac pôdy, aby sa dostali na námestie, postavili by dvadsaťpäť čistých víl. Tie by priniesli nájomné za pôdu vo výške 225 EUR ročne, ktoré by sa mohli použiť na zmiernenie chudoby ľudí v Hornsey. Na oplátku by umožnili Komisii prerezať dve cesty cez ich pôdu, aby komisári mohli rozvíjať lesy.<br/><br/>Keď sa táto ponuka stala známou, ľudia okamžite reagovali s poplachom.<br/><br/>Dňa 16. decembra 1893 sa pán Carvell Williams v Dolnej snemovni spýtal, či cirkevní komisári súhlasili s predajom pásu pôdy správcom charity Hornsey pod podmienkou, že sa rozšíri existujúca cesta na 40 stôp, či je to predbežná schéma budovy a či by snemovňa parlamentu mala možnosť vyjadriť svoj názor.<br/><br/>Pán Leveson Gower, komisár pre cirkevné statky, odpovedal: "Áno" na prvú časť.<br/><br/>Pán Carvell Williams, "Chápem, že je zámerom zničiť túto časť Highgate Woods tým, že na nej stavia?"<br/><br/>O dva dni neskôr The Star publikoval článok hodný akéhokoľvek moderného bulváru.<br/><br/>Hviezda<br/>18. decembra 1893<br/><br/>"Parlament musí pozorne sledovať tých starých vandalov a konfederácií šprtského staviteľa cirkevných komisárov, ktorí si vždy odcudzujú nejaký pozemok alebo uprednostňujú staviteľov na rozdiel od širokej verejnosti. Komisári by nepredávali spodné drevo cirkevných dvorov platiteľom sadzieb, ale teraz navrhujú "otvoriť ho" prerezaním dvoch širokých ciest v súvislosti s jedným z ich početných stavebných projektov. Nepýta sa niekto v Parlamente otázku a nekontroluje politiku komisárov v oblasti tehál a malty?“<br/><br/>V čase, keď to bolo vytlačené, bola otázka položená a odpoveď bola buď nepravdivá, alebo nevyspytateľná. Denník The Times v dlhej správe uviedol, že komisári neboli pripravení dať záväzok, že Parlament alebo akýkoľvek iný verejný orgán by mal mať možnosť zvážiť akýkoľvek plán výstavby na mieste dreva.<br/><br/>Situácia trvala osemnásť mesiacov, kým cirkevní komisári neboli nútení začať vyšetrovanie, ktoré sa začalo v Highgate 31. mája 1895 a ktorému predsedal asistent cirkevného komisára. Vyšetrovanie vyvolalo záplavu novinových listov, z ktorých to bolo najdôležitejšie.<br/><br/>The Daily Chronicle, 5. júna 1895<br/><br/>VANDALISMUS V HIGHGATE<br/><br/>Pane –<br/><br/>Jeden z najkrajších kúskov lesov na predmestí Londýna je ohrozený. Pomôžete nám odvrátiť to, čo by bolo katastrofou nielen v bezprostrednej štvrti, ale v celom husto osídlenom severnom Londýne? V žiadnej časti metropoly nebol staviteľ aktívnejší ako v Crouch End a Hornsey. Krásne lúky pred rokom alebo dvoma sú teraz domy a obchody. Záťažové haldy zaujali miesto majestátnych julmov a gaštanov a kedysi príjemné dediny zdieľajú osud Stroud Green, Harringay, Finsbury Park, Highbury a Islington.<br/><br/>---- Objekt je výstavba dvoch štyridsať stôp ciest cez lesy.

Zahrnutie dvoch duchovných bolo chytrým krokom. Pamätajte si, že to bolo stále na vrchole Darwinovej kontroverzie. Darwin rozdelil vieru v učenie Cirkvi a mnohí ľudia by len z tohto pohľadu nenávideli moc Cirkvi. Cirkev nebola taká bezpečná, ako predstierala.<br/><br/>The Evening News, 7. júna 1895 povedal:<br/><br/>"Ak sa cirkevné komnussioners nie sú riešené naraz, budova chobotnice dostane zovretie dreva, ktoré bude veľmi ťažké uvoľniť neskôr, -. Preto je dobré, aby Londýňania boli hore a robili, ak by zachránili jeden z ich najkrajších kúskov rustikálnej scenérie. Verejné vyšetrovanie je odložené na budúci štvrtok a predtým sa musí urobiť niečo, aby sa komisári presvedčili, že občania Londýna nebudú tolerovať konfiškáciu jedného zo svojich obľúbených ihrísk.<br/><br/>List v Daily Chronicle na druhý deň napísal:<br/><br/>.... Bolo to s veľkou úľavou, že obyvatelia, asi pred desiatimi rokmi, počul, že nákup Horné drevo bolo vykonané; a ako nádherné požehnanie to ukázalo, každý, kto ich navštívil môže svedčiť, ale všetci, ktorí sa snažili zachrániť tieto horné lesy, ktoré ležia na západnej strane Muswell Hill ceste, cítil, že ich víťazstvo bolo neúplné, pokiaľ šesťdesiat akrov na východnej strane zostal v nebezpečenstve. Je to, ako to bolo, nehoda, že lesy sú rozdelené širokou diaľnicou. Môže niekto pochybovať o tom, aký účinok by bol, keby Churchyard Bottom Wood boli nahradené radmi malých víl, z ktorých každá vysiela svoj príspevok dymu a sadzí? Môže niekto pochybovať aj o tom, aký veľký rozdiel by to urobilo s malebným prostredím zakúpených lesov, ak by sa línia zízajúcich nových domov prehnala priamo proti ich listnatému průčelí?<br/><br/>Vyjadril názory mnohých ľudí. V skutočnosti, jamkové drevo, ktoré autor nazýva "horným drevom", nebolo zakúpené, ale dané okresu cirkevnou komisiou, bod, ktorý mali opakovať znova a znova v priebehu rokov, ale väčšina ľudí ho ignorovala. Komisia sa nechystala rozdať druhé drevo, nech už niekto povedal čokoľvek, a túto pozíciu zastávala až do konca.<br/><br/>H.S.Chamberlain, z 5 Cranley Gardens, v liste Times z 8. júna 1895 naliehal na nákup.<br/><br/>Viem, že je bežné hovoriť tvrdo o cirkevných komisároch, ale ako správcovia fondu sú povinní spravovať to s najväčšou výhodou, a preto, ak sa má niečo urobiť na záchranu demolácie dreva, zdá sa mi, že to môže byť vykonané iba nákupom majetku od komisárov, ktorých poznám, sú plne živí na ochranu voľných a otvorených priestorov.<br/><br/>(To sa týka Crouch Koniec hracie pole, ktoré bolo zabezpečené o niekoľko rokov neskôr.)<br/><br/>Ako predseda Konzervatívnej asociácie Muswell Hill som neustále v kontakte s obyvateľmi a môžem bezpečne potvrdiť, že každý obyvateľ v susedstve by urobil čokoľvek, aby zachoval.<br/><br/>(Všetko, čo osobne chcel, bol príjem Charity na podporu svojich chudobných ľudí. Požadoval svoj aker pôdy - nie veľmi určite - veril ubezpečeniu komisárov, že drevo nie je v nebezpečenstve.)<br/><br/>“Muswell Hill Road bola jednou z najlepších v Hornsey a ostala by rovnako krásna, domy alebo žiadne domy.”<br/><br/>(A potom prišiel veľký rétorický rozkvet.)<br/><br/>'Majú chudobní trpieť kvôli sentimentálnym námietkam a hysterickému výkriku 'vlka, ktorý práve vychovali vaši korešpondenti? Aker pôdy pridanej k charitatívnej nehnuteľnosti by nemal žiadny zjavný rozdiel v zostávajúcej pôde, zatiaľ čo zisk z nej by pomohol mnohým chudobným starým a zaslúženým osobám v ich klesajúcich rokoch a umožnil by nám odovzdať našim nástupcom majetok, ktorý by v ďalekej budúcnosti mal veľkú hodnotu pri poskytovaní charitatívnej pomoci chudobným, ktorí si zaslúžia z farnosti Hornsey."<br/><br/>Pri čítaní jeho listu človek cíti hystériu veľmi blízko povrchu. Prečo si myslel, že komisári chcú postaviť cestu? Prečo by mali minúť všetky tie peniaze, ak nie na výstavbu domov? Zdalo sa, že si nikdy neuvedomil, že na aker pôdy bude celé drevo stratené. Bol to človek, ktorému komisári ponúkli predaj za 25 000 rokov a je to jeho meno, ktoré je poctené na plakete na Crouch End Clock Tower za záchranu dreva, ale jeho dôvera v cirkevných komisárov sa zdá naivná. Je smutné, že pri vyšetrovaní mal byť obsadený ako diabol.<br/><br/>Vyšetrovanie pokračovalo<br/><br/>Odročenie sa otvorilo v Highgate 15. júna 1895. Očakávajúc veľké zhromaždenie, komora Rady bola úplne zmenená. Zvyčajné stoly boli odstránené a miestnosť bola naplnená stoličkami. O pol siedmej bola miestnosť preplnená a ľudia sa hádali o miesta.<br/><br/>Pán Murray, komisár, povedal, že vyšetrovanie bolo naozaj jednoduché. Hornsey Parochial Charities chcel kúpiť kúsok pozemku priľahlého k ich charitatívnej nehnuteľnosti vzadu. Otázkou bolo, či charitatívna komisia, ktorá kontrolovala všetky charity, mala dostatok sily na to, aby ich zastavila. Cirkevní komisári boli pripravení predať pozemok za veľmi výhodných podmienok a príjem Charity by sa veľmi výrazne zvýšil.<br/><br/>Proti tomu boli tri triedy námietok.<br/><br/>Pôvodný trust bol určený na zabezpečenie chatrčí pre chudobných, ale správcovia navrhovali postaviť vily, ktoré by boli pre chudobných príliš drahé. Avšak, to bolo v právomoci správcov meniť podmienky Trust, takže by mohli stavať vily, ak si mysleli, že chudobní budú mať prospech na konci. Sami chudobní by mohli namietať, ale liberálne ustanovenia im už boli sľúbené. Tretia námietka sa týkala estetickej a verejnej stránky otázky. Vyvodil z toho, čo čítal, že Charitatívna komisia by mala zasahovať, aby zabránila cirkevným komisárom uplatňovať svoju vlastnú diskrétnosť pri zaobchádzaní s vlastným majetkom.<br/><br/>Vyšetrovanie diskutovalo o dobrých bodoch, ale rečníci sa stále vracali k hlavnému problému zabránenia akejkoľvek deštrukcii dreva. Islingtonský úradník, ktorý zastupuje 300 000 ľudí, formálne protestoval proti akejkoľvek časti dreva, ktoré je pre obyvateľov Islingtonu a Hornsey tak cenné, že sa používa na súkromné účely. Pán Wilfred White povedal, že ak im komisári poskytnú čas, budú môcť získať peniaze na odškodnenie správcov.<br/><br/>Beaumont povedal, že nechcú vily, chcú chaty pre chudobných ľudí, ktorí boli vyhnaní z okresu. Iní povedali, že neboli žiadne peniaze na výstavbu chatrčí, ktoré by nahradili súčasné schátralé, ale vily by boli ekonomickým návrhom. Iní odpovedali, že tam bolo veľa víl, ktoré by mohli vpustiť do Highgate. Drevo bolo posvätné. Držte sa otázky dreva.<br/><br/>Dr Fletcher povedal, že plač medzi pracujúcimi ľuďmi bol, že nie je kam ísť. Pracujúci ľudia prišli k nemu s výkrikom, "Sme vyhnaní z Highgate a sú povinní ísť do Highgate New Town." Ak by bola predná časť Muswell Hill Road predaná, nebolo pochýb o tom, že cesty by mohli byť prerezané priamo cez lesy smerom na Hornsey, ale ak by komisári nemohli získať pôdu od charitatívnej komisie, nemohli by prerezať cestu.<br/><br/>Bol si istý, že chaty by mohli byť v stave opravy. Chudobní ľudia, polícia a niekoľko robotníckych tried ho požiadali, aby zastupoval tieto dva body, že v Highgate je veľmi potrebné ubytovanie na chate a že ak raz povolia predaj pôdy, nedá sa povedať, kde sa bude držať ruka staviteľa.<br/><br/>(Hlasitý a dlhotrvajúci pozdrav).<br/><br/>Prehovorilo mnoho ďalších ľudí a komnusionár zhrnul, že prijal, že prevládajúci názor je v prospech zachovania chatrčí, ale stretnutie by nemalo robiť žiadne závery z toho, čo povedal.<br/><br/>Iní hovorili, že správcovia Charity zlyhali vo svojich povinnostiach tým, že nechali chaty upadnúť do havarijného stavu.<br/><br/>Pán H.R. Williams, správca, ktorý predtým napísal do novín, povedal, že má tú najlepšiu autoritu, že cirkevní komisári nebudú robiť žiadne cesty a nebudú mať prospech z činnosti komisárov pre charitu. Iní boli oveľa menej dôverčiví a stretnutie sa skončilo po takmer troch hodinách.<br/><br/>"Stojíme pred skutočnosťou, že v Highgate a Muswell Hill je množstvo ľudí, ktorí chcú Churchyard Bottom Wood a nebudú šťastní, kým ho nebudú mať - zatiaľ čo sa zdá, že nikto nie je ochotný minúť peniaze, aby za to zaplatil. Každý hovorí, že by bolo pekné mať drevo ako otvorený priestor, ale každý si myslí, že je povinnosťou niekoho iného, aby ho vytvoril. Islington Vestry má "vyriešené" na túto tému, ale Islington Vestry neponúka cent kus k nákupu. Neexistuje žiadny zložitejší problém, ktorý by komunita alebo jednotlivec mohli vyriešiť, ako získať majetok iných ľudí bez toho, aby za to zaplatili.<br/><br/>Platiť za to bol naozaj problém, pretože Churchyard Bottom Wood sa stal predmetom intenzívnej miestnej a národnej diskusie. Bola vytvorená spoločná komisia, aby získala peniaze na záchranu dreva. 20. novembra 1896, C.F. Cory-Wright, Hon pokladník, napísal na Štandard, denný papier v tej dobe, žiada o pomoc. Pripomenul všetkým nebezpečenstvo straty dreva a povedal, že to môže byť ušetrené len tým, že ho kúpi. Cirkevní komisári by predali za 25 000 libier a navyše (5 000 by bolo potrebných na oplotenie a odvodnenie, čo by celkovo predstavovalo 30 000 libier. To bolo príliš veľa na to, aby rada Hornsey získala, ale už hlasovala za celkovú sumu 10 000 libier. Lesy mali neoceniteľnú hodnotu pre celý severný Londýn, a tak apeloval na verejné orgány a súkromné osoby, aby zvýšili zvyšných 20 000 libier. Varoval, že súčasná ponuka od cirkevných komisárov je otvorená až do konca roku 1898. Potom sa stavitelia nasťahujú.<br/><br/>Odvolanie bolo vrelo vítané tlačou. Súkromný zákon bol urýchlene prostredníctvom parlamentu a Highgate Woods Preservation Act, 1897, sa stal zákonom. Conunittee teraz mal právo inzerovať príspevky na nákup dreva a jeho zachovanie.<br/><br/>V pomerne krátkom čase sa vyzbierali takmer všetky peniaze, ale posledných niekoľko tisíc sa ukázalo ako veľmi ťažké a konečný termín komisárov bol otázkou týždňov. Pán Cory-Wright písal prosby o viac času, ale bol mu poskytnutý iba tri mesiace a potom len vtedy, ak bol zaplatený úrok vo výške 4 percenta za dodatočnú lehotu z celej sumy. Londýnska krajská rada, ktorá pôvodne ponúkla 2500 libier, to nakoniec dosiahla až do výšky 5 000 libier a celková suma bola dosiahnutá, ale bola to blízka vec.<br/><br/>Rada sa rozhodla premenovať drevo na "Kráľovnin les" na počesť diamantového jubilea kráľovnej Viktórie a Hornseyho, keď vojvodkyňa z Albany formálne vyhlásila drevo za otvorené "pre slobodné použitie verejnosťou navždy".<br/><br/>Zatiaľ čo kampaň na záchranu Churchyard Bottom Wood bola vedená a riadená miestnymi ľuďmi, ktorí sa vášnivo zaujímali o tento konkrétny kus lesa, vyzvali na pomoc a skúsenosti rozsiahlej siete ľudí, z ktorých niektorí spolupracovali na podobných kampaniach viac ako tridsať rokov. Výbor vydal odvolanie, vytlačené na veľmi kvalitnom papieri a označené niektorými slávnymi menami.<br/><br/>Otázky otvoreného priestoru a verejného zdravia boli hlavnými témami viktoriánskej vízie.<br/><br/>Hnutie otvorených priestorov<br/><br/>Octavia Hill, veľký bytový reformátor, ktorý začal s tromi starými domami v Marylebone, kúpil pre ňu Jolm Ruskin, sa rýchlo stal odborníkom na bývanie chudobných ľudí v najzdravších možných podmienkach. Jej spôsob bol kúpiť nájomné a potom zbúrať niektoré z preplnených domov, aby sa svetlo a vzduch na zvyšok, veriť, že čerstvý vzduch a slnečné svetlo boli jediný spôsob, ako chudobní ľudia mohli byť zachránení od "hnisavej horúčky. Naučila sa to ako dieťa od svojho starého otca, Southwooda Smitha, ktorý vyvinul svoje teórie v nemocnici Fever Hospital v King's Cross.<br/><br/>Postavil prvé priemyselné obydlia pre chudobných ľudí a štatisticky dokázal, že dobrý vzduch a slušná drenáž zachránili životy. Gibson Gardens, v Northwold Road, je priamym výsledkom nápadov Southwood Smith. Viac informácií o Gibson Gardens<br/><br/>Dôležitosť otvoreného vzduchu<br/><br/>Otvorené priestory a možnosť dýchať čistý vzduch, boli nevyhnutné pre ľudí žijúcich v jednej alebo dvoch preplnených miestnostiach. Octavia Hill vzala svoje poplatky z Lisson Grove slumov, hore Fitzjohn Avenue do Hampstead Heath. Tak milovala polia Fitzjohnovej Avenue, že sa ich pokúsila kúpiť ako verejný park. Mali stáť 10,000 libier a do troch augustových týždňov bolo vychovaných 8500 libier. Potreboval len koniec letných prázdnin a návrat z dovolenky súcitných priateľov a ďalších 1 500 libier by sa zvýšilo, ale majitelia náhle stiahli svoju ponuku. Napriek všetkým prosbám boli polia pokryté veľkými domami.<br/><br/>Z toho sa vyvinula kampaň na záchranu Parliament Hill, ďalšieho otvoreného priestoru na sever od Lisson Grove, skupujúceho polia v ceste staviteľov, aby sa vytvoril trvalý sanitárny kordón proti postupujúcim tehlám. Parlament Hill Fields kampaň bola tak úspešná, že Hampstead Heath Bill bol odovzdaný a tam boli peniaze z odvolania. Z týchto peňazí a impulz k otvoreným priestorom, bolo rozvíjať National Trust. Octavia Hillová sa roky zaujímala o ochranu oblastí ako Church Bottom Wood, takže bola prirodzeným spojencom v boji za záchranu dreva.<br/><br/>Commons Preservation Society tiež, bol oboznámený s týmto druhom agitácie a zbieranie peňazí. Mali zbúrané oplotenie, keď páni panstva uzavreli kúsky spoločnej pôdy, čo viedlo k legálnym aj nelegálnym bojom proti arogantnej privatizácii pôdy tradične slobodnej. Robert Hunter, ich čestný advokát z roku 1868, sa vždy zaoberal zabezpečením otvorených priestorov, veľkých alebo malých, pre verejnosť. On, teraz sir Robert Hunter, sa stal predsedom cirkvi Bottom Appeal. Predsedom Dolnej spoločnosti pre zachovanie bol poslanec Shaw-Lefevre (neskôr Lord Eversley), ktorý zohral veľkú úlohu v tejto a ďalších kampaniach v Dolnej snemovni. Octavia Hill sa podieľala na ich práci približne od roku 1875.<br/><br/>V tom istom čase Octavia Hillová viedla kampaň za návrh zákona o pohrebe.<br/><br/>Mestské cintoríny sa stali tak plnými a takým vážnym ohrozením zdravia kontamináciou studní, z ktorých ľudia čerpali pitnú vodu, že mestské pohreby už neboli povolené. Namiesto toho boli na okraji mesta vytvorené cintoríny. Jedným z nich bol cintorín Abney Park. Potom sa uskutočnilo hnutie na odstránenie náhrobných kameňov na okrajoch starých mestských cintorínov, premiešanie tiel inde a premenu cintorínov na záhrady a otvorené priestory, namiesto toho, aby sa na nich stavali. Táto krajina v centre Londýna bola veľmi cenná a špekulanti ju chceli získať: Dokonca aj kvakeri postavili nad jedným zo svojich cintorínov a hrozili, že to urobia znovu tým, že postavia nad Bunhill Fields. Octavia Hill mala sieť spojencov v tuctoch polí, takže jej pomoc pri záchrane Church Bottom Wood musela byť neoceniteľná.<br/><br/>Spoločnosť Metropolitan Gardens Society, ktorá bola založená v roku 1882, rozložila do roku 1890 asi dvesto malých záhrad v centrách miest. Neskôr ich odovzdali miestnym orgánom, takže ich podpora pre Churchyard Bottom Wood Appeal bola zabezpečená od začiatku.<br/><br/>Spoločnosť Kyrle je teraz zabudnutá, ale vo svojej dobe mala veľký vplyv na územné plánovanie a legislatívu otvoreného priestoru. Spoločnosť bola založená okolo roku 1875 pre "difúziu krásy", aby priniesla farbu a záujem do života ľudí žijúcich v nudnom, nudnom prostredí. Jasné farby na stenách a dekorácii, dobrý spev, otvorené priestory, príroda, literatúra a umenie. To všetko patrilo do kompetencie Spoločnosti. Bola tam dekoratívna pobočka, pre ktorú prednášal William Morris; hudobná pobočka na propagáciu zborov a šťastných večerov pre ľudí v miestnych školských budovách; a literatúra. Spoločnosť pravidelne apelovala listami v The Times na "bohatšie triedy", aby sa knihy a periodiká distribuovali do chlapčenských a dievčenských klubov, almužien a inde. Výbor pre otvorené priestory bol však najaktívnejší. Samotný názov "Kyrle" pochádza z pápežovho Muža Rossa, filantropa, ktorý dal svoje rodisko ľuďom ako verejný park. |
| With Thanksgiving around the corner, here are some festive file folder games we made for the girls. Both Thanksgiving games focus on math skills. And I'm grateful once again to my husband, Ed, for making all the clipart for me.<br/><br/>Thanksgiving Pattern Making<br/><br/>Like the name says, this game is about making patterns. Little ones just learning about patterns, can simply match the pictures onto the pattern strips, while others can continue the pattern with the picture cards on the blank strips.<br/><br/>To make the file folder, you want to cut out the grid of pictures to make the card pieces. I recommend laminating them to help them last longer. Then glue the pattern strips down on the file folder.<br/><br/>I wanted to have the blank pattern strips too so that the girls could see where to continue the pattern and how many to lay out. I attached them to the side of the folder using tape so that they could fold in to pack up the game and extend to layout the pattern.<br/><br/>I also added an extra blank one so that the girls could make their own pattern as well.<br/><br/>Turkey Number Game<br/><br/>In this game the girls add the feathers to the turkey body while practicing counting and number recognition. I used the colorless feathers to act as a guide for where to add the feathers and so that the girls could match the numbers. And be sure when gluing down the turkey body you only glue in the center so that the wing pieces can slide under the body.<br/><br/>Once all the feathers are laid out, we practice some simple arithmetic, such as taking away three feathers and seeing how many are left then adding two back to see what it equals.<br/><br/>In addition to black and white wings, we also included a colorless turkey in case you want to have the little ones color their own set. Instead of a file folder game you can turn this into a craft, coloring the pieces, cutting them out, and gluing them together.<br/><br/>Another option is to use the pieces to make a felt board story. We sometimes sing a turkey version of 10 Little Indians:<br/><br/>Like this:<br/><br/>Who Am I?<br/><br/>I think this is where I'm suppose to say something witty about myself. Oh well. I'm a stay-at-home mom to three awesome kids--our twin daughters who are seven now and a two-year-old son who is full of energy. In my pre-children life I was a teacher and I now homeschool our children. I'm also married to Ed, who is currently serving in the Air Force, and is the love of my life (it'd be awkward if he wasn't). Our family is big on books, crafts, and having fun together. I just thought I would share our activities in my own little corner of the internet.<br/><br/>Zoe appears to have it all--rich, handsome husband, easy New York life--but she made mistakes in her past and those mistakes are coming back up in her new life. I found myself on the edge of my seat for most of the book and was surprised...<br/><br/>I loved this book, I love the story, and I am grateful Margot Shetterly brought it to light. My only complaint was that I wished she discussed Katherine Johnson's role in the later missions a bit more but I guess the story had to end som...<br/><br/>I wanted to like this book and I did throughout most of it.

A som vďačný môj manžel, Ed, pre výrobu všetkých klipart pre mňa.<br/><br/>Vďakyvzdania vzor tvorby<br/><br/>Ako už názov napovedá, táto hra je o vytváraní vzorov. Maličkí sa len učia o vzoroch, môžu jednoducho prispôsobiť obrázky na vzorové prúžky, zatiaľ čo iní môžu pokračovať v vzore s obrázkovými kartami na prázdnych prúžkoch.<br/><br/>Ak chcete vytvoriť priečinok so súbormi, chcete vystrihnúť mriežku obrázkov, aby sa kúsky kariet. Odporúčam ich laminovať, aby im pomohli vydržať dlhšie. Potom prilepte pásy vzorov nadol na priečinok so súbormi.<br/><br/>Chcel som mať aj prázdne pruhy, aby dievčatá videli, kde pokračovať v vzore a koľko ich rozložiť. Pripojil som ich na stranu priečinka pomocou pásky, aby sa mohli zložiť, aby zbalili hru a rozšírili rozloženie vzoru.<br/><br/>Tiež som pridala jednu navyše, aby si dievčatá mohli vytvoriť svoj vlastný vzor.<br/><br/>Turecká číselná hra<br/><br/>V tejto hre dievčatá pridávajú perie do tela moriek a zároveň praktizujú počítanie a rozpoznávanie čísel. Použil som bezfarebné perie, aby som pôsobil ako sprievodca, kde pridať perie a aby sa dievčatá mohli zhodovať s číslami. A uistite sa, že pri lepení tela moriaka sa prilepíte len v strede, aby sa kusy krídel mohli posúvať pod telom.<br/><br/>Akonáhle sú všetky perie rozložené, praktizujeme nejakú jednoduchú aritmetiku, ako napríklad odobrať tri perie a vidieť, koľko zostáva, potom pridáme dve späť, aby sme zistili, čo sa rovná.<br/><br/>Okrem čiernych a bielych krídel sme zahrnuli aj bezfarebné moriaky pre prípad, že by ste chceli mať malé deti farebné svoje vlastné sety. Namiesto súboru priečinka hry môžete premeniť to na remeslo, farbenie kusov, rezanie je von, a lepenie je dohromady.<br/><br/>Ďalšou možnosťou je použiť kúsky na vytvorenie príbehu. Niekedy spievame tureckú verziu 10 malých indiánov:<br/><br/>Takto:<br/><br/>Kto som?<br/><br/>Myslím, že to je miesto, kde by som mal povedať niečo vtipné o sebe. Oh dobre.

Som tiež ženatý s Edom, ktorý v súčasnosti slúži v letectve, a je láskou môjho života (bolo by to trápne, keby nebol). Naša rodina je nadšená do kníh, remesiel a spoločnej zábavy.

| Alcohol use by persons under age 21 has been identified as a major public health problem. Studies note that it increases the risks for disability, and may be detrimental to the developing brain. Minors who drink are more likely to commit suicide, break the law, or be victims of violence. Alcohol is implicated in nearly one-third of youth traffic fatalities. The total annual cost of underage drinking is estimated at $62 billion. While most laws intended to prevent underage drinking are passed at the state level, there has been legislative activity and interest at the federal level to support states' efforts to curb the problem. This report describes the extent of underage alcohol use, recent legislative activity on this issue, and various policy implications. It will be updated as new data become available. | Užívanie alkoholu osobami mladšími ako 21 rokov bolo identifikované ako hlavný problém verejného zdravia. Štúdie poznamenávajú, že zvyšuje riziko zdravotného postihnutia a môže byť škodlivé pre vyvíjajúci sa mozog. Maloleté osoby, ktoré pijú, s väčšou pravdepodobnosťou spáchajú samovraždu, porušia zákon alebo sa stanú obeťami násilia. Alkohol je zapletený do takmer jednej tretiny úmrtí mladistvých pri dopravných nehodách. Celkové ročné náklady na pitie neplnoletých sa odhadujú na 62 miliárd dolárov. Zatiaľ čo väčšina zákonov, ktorých cieľom je zabrániť pitiu neplnoletých, je schválená na štátnej úrovni, na federálnej úrovni existuje legislatívna činnosť a záujem o podporu úsilia štátov o obmedzenie tohto problému. V tejto správe sa opisuje rozsah užívania alkoholu neplnoletými osobami, nedávna legislatívna činnosť v tejto oblasti a rôzne politické dôsledky. Bude sa aktualizovať, keď budú k dispozícii nové údaje. |
| Tag Archives: real food<br/><br/>Last week I wrote about the Nordic Food Manifesto, and how Denmark created a strong "real food" culture largely from an intentional effort led by Claus Meyer. It wasn't political lobbying or public petitioning that resulted in food reform, but rather a grassroots effort led by citizens with the power to actually implement and follow-through with change.<br/><br/>I ended the post alluding to one question: Why is it so hard for us to do this ourselves, as individuals? If an entire country can implement and spread a common view towards food, why can't we?<br/><br/>There's nothing really stopping us from mimicking Denmark's success. The problem is, we're inundated with so many messages about what we should be eating, and how we should be living, it's hard to know where to start. So rather than following successful frameworks that have been shown to work (like the Nordic Food Manifesto), most people jump from diet craze to diet craze, trying to find the "right way to eat."<br/><br/>But how did Claus Meyer succeed? What was the secret sauce that helped the Manifesto take hold? And is it reasonable to think we can apply those lessons to our own lives?

The unique outer crispiness of the meat gave way to a perfectly juicy interior, resulting in a sound more similar to slicing into a calzone than a ground beef patty.<br/><br/>We were sitting in Copenhagen's oldest pub, which felt more like a casual bistro than a bar, and I was about to try the dish recommended by our waitress/bar tender/proprietor?<br/><br/>"The Paris Beef, it's very good," she had said. "It's not from France… it's very Danish."<br/><br/>Sign me up!<br/><br/>Paris beef with fresh veggies and raw egg yolk at Rabes Have in Copenhagen | Tag Archives: skutočné jedlo<br/><br/>Minulý týždeň som písal o Manifeste severských potravín a o tom, ako Dánsko vytvorilo silnú kultúru "skutočného jedla" prevažne z úmyselného úsilia vedeného Clausom Meyerom. Nebolo to politické lobovanie alebo verejné petície, ktoré viedli k potravinovej reforme, ale skôr úsilie na miestnej úrovni vedené občanmi s právomocou skutočne realizovať a sledovať zmeny.<br/><br/>Skončil som príspevok narážajúc na jednu otázku: Prečo je to tak ťažké pre nás urobiť sami, ako jednotlivci? Ak celá krajina môže realizovať a šíriť spoločný pohľad na potraviny, prečo nie my?<br/><br/>Problém je, že sme zaplavení toľkými správami o tom, čo by sme mali jesť a ako by sme mali žiť, je ťažké vedieť, kde začať. Takže namiesto toho, aby sa riadili úspešnými rámcami, o ktorých sa ukázalo, že fungujú (ako je Nordic Food Manifesto), väčšina ľudí skočí z diétneho šialenstva do diétneho šialenstva a snaží sa nájsť "správny spôsob, ako jesť."<br/><br/>Ale ako uspel Claus Meyer? Aká bola tajná omáčka, ktorá pomohla Manifestu? A je rozumné si myslieť, že tieto lekcie môžeme aplikovať na naše vlastné životy?

Jedinečná vonkajšia chrumkavosť mäsa ustúpila dokonale šťavnatému interiéru, čo viedlo k zvuku, ktorý sa viac podobá krájaniu na kalzónu ako na mleté hovädzie mäso.<br/><br/>Sedeli sme v najstaršej kodanskej krčme, ktorá sa cítila skôr ako príležitostné bistro ako bar, a ja som sa chystal vyskúšať jedlo odporúčané našou čašníčkou / barovým tenderom / majiteľom?<br/><br/>"Parížske hovädzie je veľmi dobré," povedala. "Nie je to z Francúzska... je to veľmi dánske."<br/><br/>Prihláste ma!<br/><br/>Parížske hovädzie mäso s čerstvou zeleninou a surovým vaječným žĺtkom v Rabes Have v Kodani |
