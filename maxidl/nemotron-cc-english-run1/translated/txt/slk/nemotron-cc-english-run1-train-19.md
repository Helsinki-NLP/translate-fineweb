| Quidditch through the ages<br/><br/>I was doodling some quidditch-related objects like broomsticks and snitches and whatnot and it sort of turned into this odd compilation of things, including Harry down there at the bottom. I am not completely satisfied with the way it came out, but since it's not bad for my second Harry Potter fan-art picture, I decided to color it anyway. If you are wondering where his scar is, it's there, but it's very very light and small because I did that bit on the computer. Sketched in pen, colored in Paint. | Famfrpál v priebehu vekov<br/><br/>Robil som si čmáranice s nejakými predmetmi, ako sú metly a práskače a tak a tak sa to zmenilo na túto zvláštnu kompiláciu vecí, vrátane Harryho tam dole. Nie som úplne spokojný s tým, ako to vyšlo, ale keďže to nie je zlé pre môj druhý obrázok Harryho Pottera, rozhodol som sa ho aj tak vyfarbiť. Ak vás zaujíma, kde je jeho jazva, je to tam, ale je to veľmi ľahké a malé, pretože som to urobil na počítači. |
| I just started saltwater fly fishing this summer and I need a new reel, so it'll definitely be the Kraken. (I'm in Florida; we don't have those little trout minnow things around here. ) Private Message on the way to you.<br/><br/>I'm thrilled and flattered. I'm also trying to figure out a way to explain to She-Who-Must-Be-Obeyed that I'll need to buy a new rod worthy of this reel.....<br/><br/>I've always found that no explanation is the best explanation. Don't give her a reason to ever say you're not spontaneous enough. | Práve som začal tento rok v lete loviť morské mušky a potrebujem nový navijak, takže to určite bude Kraken. (Som na Floride; nemáme tu tie malé pstruhové veci. ) Súkromná správa na ceste k vám.<br/><br/>Som nadšený a polichotený. Tiež sa snažím prísť na spôsob, ako vysvetliť She-Who-Must-Be-Obeyed, že budem musieť kúpiť nový prút hodný tohto kotúča.....<br/><br/>Vždy som zistila, že žiadne vysvetlenie nie je to najlepšie vysvetlenie, nedávajte jej dôvod, aby povedala, že nie ste dosť spontánny. |
| If you were admitted and enrolled --> yes If you were admitted and attended another school --> yes If you took extension courses (do they even have them there? I know UCLA does) --> yes If you went to graduate school there --> yes<br/><br/>That's my interpretation because any of these scenarios would fulfill either being "admitted to an undergraduate program" or "taking courses" at UC Berkeley. I could be completely wrong though, you're better off just calling them and clarifying your specific situation.<br/><br/>My opinion: Based on the wording, I interpreted it as asking if you were admitted to Berkeley undergrad, whether or not you chose to attend. If it meant admitted and attended, they could easily have seen that through the "Undergrad Institutions" portion of the application. | Ak ste boli prijatí a zapísaní --> áno Ak ste boli prijatí a navštevovali inú školu --> áno Ak ste absolvovali rozšírené kurzy (dokonca ich tam majú? Viem, že UCLA má) --> áno Ak ste tam chodili na postgraduálnu školu --> áno<br/><br/>To je moja interpretácia, pretože niektorý z týchto scenárov by spĺňal buď "prijatie do vysokoškolského programu" alebo "absolvovanie kurzov" na UC Berkeley. Mohol by som sa však úplne mýliť, je lepšie, keď im zavoláte a objasníte svoju konkrétnu situáciu.<br/><br/>Môj názor: Na základe znenia som to interpretoval ako otázku, či ste boli prijatí na Berkeley undergrad, či ste sa rozhodli zúčastniť. Ak by to znamenalo prijatie a účasť, mohli by to ľahko vidieť prostredníctvom časti aplikácie "Undergrade Institutions". |
| ...........A lot of the time head bolts are angle tightened so you set them at say 20Nm for a starting point then angle tighten them from there.<br/><br/>.....I would have preferred a bigger hammer<br/><br/>Cheers.<br/><br/>You can never have too big a hammer<br/><br/>I'll confess.<br/>There must be a fine distinction between torque setting with a Click torque wrench and angle setting but even as an engineer, I don't really understand it.<br/><br/>To me, if you tighten a bolt you get to a point when it locks. And as TTT says at a relatively low torque. After that, further tightening both increases the torque load and the head angle ??<br/><br/>To me it's a distinction between measurement techniques rather then final result. If anyone can explain why one instead of the other I'd be greatful ??<br/><br/>I'm sure other old farts will remember old style torque wrenches with the separate pointer that swung around a graduated scale as you put load on them.<br/>Graduated in Ft Lbs, measurement in angle.<br/>Aren't these just a variation on the theme ?? | ...........Veľa času hlava skrutky sú utiahnuté uhol, takže si nastaviť na povedzme 20Nm pre východiskový bod potom uhol utiahnuť je odtiaľ.<br/><br/>Uprednostnil by som väčšie kladivo.<br/><br/>Na zdravie.<br/><br/>Nikdy nemôžete mať príliš veľké kladivo<br/><br/>Priznám sa.<br/>Musí existovať jemný rozdiel medzi nastavením krútiaceho momentu s momentovým kľúčom Click a nastavením uhla, ale ani ako inžinier tomu naozaj nerozumiem.<br/><br/>Pre mňa, ak utiahnete skrutku, dostanete sa do bodu, keď sa zablokuje. A ako hovorí TTT pri relatívne nízkom krútiacom momente. Potom ďalšie uťahovanie zvyšuje zaťaženie krútiaceho momentu a uhol hlavy ??<br/><br/>Pre mňa je to rozdiel medzi meracími technikami, skôr než konečný výsledok. Ak niekto môže vysvetliť, prečo jeden namiesto druhého by som bol skvelý ??<br/><br/>Som si istý, že ostatné staré prdy si pamätajú staré krútiace momentové kľúče so samostatným ukazovateľom, ktorý sa otáčal okolo odstupňovanej stupnice, keď ste na ne položili zaťaženie.<br/>Absolvoval Ft Lbs, meranie v uhle.<br/>Nie je to variácia na túto tému??? |
| Winter Protection for Fig Trees<br/><br/>Report This Article<br/><br/>Winter Protection for Fig Trees<br/><br/>Overview<br/><br/>The fig tree has been around since at least 5,000 B.C., and is grown throughout the world for its delicious fruit. Figs grow well in a mild climate without weather extremes. The fig tree is now propagated in some areas with harsh winters. Protective precautions are required to save the tree from winter damage.<br/><br/>Potted Fig Trees<br/><br/>Ornamental fig trees in pots can stand some freezing and do not require light once they enter the winter dormancy phase. Avoid extreme swings in temperature by placing the fig tree in a controlled environment such as a garage, where temperatures range between slightly under freezing and slight above. The plant should be watered as the soil dries.<br/><br/>Shielding<br/><br/>Shielding to protect the tree from the most extreme winter weather is required. Fig trees require placement in soil areas where the soil does not freeze to protect it from disease and increase its chances of winter survival. Large screens placed around the tree protects it from winter winds that can damage and freeze the wood.<br/><br/>Wrapping<br/><br/>Tree wrapping protects the tree from cold weather and prevents hard winds from destroying the branches. Fig tree wrapping should be applied once the leaves from the tree have fallen to prevent leaves from rotting inside the wrapping material. Fig trees are sensitive to slight temperature changes. It can not warm up inside the protective film or else the tree may begin to grow, making it susceptible to severe damage during the cold snap.<br/><br/>Planting<br/><br/>Cultivar practices help to protect the fig tree during harsh winters. Varieties that are resistant to cold weather are best for locations where the weathers are harsh. Brown Turkey, Brunswick and Blue Celeste are good cultivars for cold weather. Planting should be done against a wall or structure that will radiate heat towards the tree during the winter months.<br/><br/>Snow<br/><br/>Roots of the fig tree require dry soil during the winter dormancy period. Watering should be done only when the soil is dry and the roots should be protected from melting snow and rain. Protection placed on the ground under the tree, near the trunk--to keep water from draining into the soil--protects the tree from damage.<br/><br/>Keywords:<br/>fig tree protection, fig tree winter, fig tree care | Zimná ochrana fíkovníkov<br/><br/>Nahlásiť tento článok<br/><br/>Zimná ochrana fíkovníkov<br/><br/>Prehľad<br/><br/>Fíkovník bol asi od najmenej 5000 pred naším letopočtom, a je pestovaný po celom svete pre svoje lahodné ovocie. Fíky rastú dobre v miernom podnebí bez extrémov počasia. Fíkovník sa teraz množí v niektorých oblastiach s drsnými zimami. Na záchranu stromu pred poškodením v zime sú potrebné ochranné opatrenia.<br/><br/>črepníkové figovníky<br/><br/>Okrasné figovníky v kvetináčoch môžu vydržať nejaké zmrazenie a nevyžadujú svetlo, akonáhle vstúpia do zimnej fázy spánku. Vyhnite sa extrémnym výkyvom teploty tým, že umiestnite figovník do kontrolovaného prostredia, ako je garáž, kde sa teploty pohybujú medzi mierne pod bodom mrazu a mierne vyššie. Rastlina by mala byť napojená, keď pôda schne.<br/><br/>Tienenie<br/><br/>Je potrebné chrániť strom pred najextrémnejším zimným počasím.

| Oculus CEO comes down hard on Mac support for the Rift<br/><br/>Oculus CEO, Palmer Luckey, has not minced his words when asked in an interview whether the Rift VR headset will ever support the Mac. If you had any hopes of it being soon, you might want to ready yourselves for some disappointment.<br/><br/>That is up to Apple. If they ever release a good computer, we will do it.<br/><br/>What he's referring to there in a less diplomatic sense is the discrete graphics required to run the Rift. The simple truth is that Apple just doesn't go for high-end graphics that will meet the requirements for the headset. For context, on a Windows PC, you need a minimum of an NVIDIA GTX 970, a $300 graphics card.<br/><br/>As Luckey went on to say:<br/><br/>It just boils down to the fact that Apple doesn't prioritize high-end GPUs. You can buy a $6,000 Mac Pro with the top of the line AMD FirePro D700, and it still doesn't match our recommended specs. So if they prioritize higher-end GPUs like they used to for a while back in the day, we'd love to support Mac. But right now, there's just not a single machine out there that supports it.<br/><br/>The Mac Pro can't be accused of not packing plenty of horsepower, because it does, but equally FirePro graphics are targeted more towards the creative market, just like the Mac Pro. The Mac Pro in particular far exceeds other hardware requirements, but naturally as the Rift is graphics heavy, this is where the shortfall is. Luckey is perhaps being a little over the top, but equally he's the man behind the Rift, so there's no doubts plenty of truth to what he says. Even if he doesn't say it particularly well.<br/><br/>What say you, Mac owners of the world? Are you even bothered about the Oculus Rift or is it something you wish you could have? Sound off in the comments below!<br/><br/>Reader comments<br/><br/>Oculus CEO comes down hard on Mac support for the Rift<br/><br/>No, not bothered by it since I really wasn't planning on buying an Oculus Rift. For me the product category is still too early and too much in a beta-kinda phase. But he does rise a valid point. Apple should try to get more ahead of the pack CPU/GPU wise. Right now they're always trailing behind.<br/><br/>Excuse me, but what is HTC Vive better at? And Oculus Rift most certainly supports Linux machines that meet their hardware specifications! (The issue is not OS but hardware.)<br/><br/>Also, look at WHY the HTC Vive supports OS X: it includes more of its own hardware. (Which is why it costs so much.) The Oculus solutions - both the Rift and the Samsung Gear VR - require the hardware that it is plugging into to perform more of the heavy lifting.<br/><br/>VR isn't a gimmick. 3D TVs don't always give that much of a 3d effect, and it doesn't work with everyone. VR works with everyone, and the Oculus and HTC Vive official release products have almost no latency so there shoudn't be any motion sickness. There's also plenty of game support<br/><br/>Obviously if gaming is a priority you're generally not in the market for a Mac, though. Not many game developers support OSX so these types of devices likely have limited use on a Mac (for gaming, anyways, which the Rift was designed for). At least that's the only reason I could see myself using one. I definitely wouldn't use it for watching movies.<br/><br/>Apple did implement the Metal engine into El Capitan, there might be some plan to go into the gaming market (as Apple learned from iOS how big this market is, just look at the top grossing apps).<br/>So now the hardware is missing and and game devs would probably show some interest, since Macs there are now an acceptable amount of Mac users around the world.<br/><br/>I would like to see Apple make its way into that sector of the industry. I don't use any Apple products presently but they're making a lot of the right moves in many areas and I'm very intrigued.<br/><br/>Plus, competition fuels innovation. I know that major computer part manufactures already create that competition but Apple has the RnD willpower and the cash to really turn heads. They may not win the numbers games in terms of specs, they actually rarely do, but most people who care to do the research know that performance != the sum of the device's parts. Apple can do more with "less". On paper their products appear inferior but when carefully balanced hardware meets specifically engineered software they generally perform just as well as the competition if not out perform.<br/><br/>HA! I love how, all of a sudden, having a high performance computer is not important to Apple phans! There is not a single Mac capable of the highest end graphics. Can't buy one, can't build one. Mac is not capable of being the highest in performance and you are good with that. HA! Classic!<br/><br/>I bought my MacBook Pro Retina in 2012 because of the high resolution screen and the non-discrete GPU. However, for my desktop I built a system with a 4K monitor, i7 4790K CPU, 3 GTX 970 GPU's, and 16 gb of memory all for less than what I'd pay for an iMac. I even have an SSD set up to boot in OSX. My point is Apple could do similar things if it wished, but doesn't. In fact, look at the most recent iMac. It includes discrete graphics and a slow 5400 RPM drive. My computer may not look as pretty, and it's not as thin, but in the end it's more useful - isn't that why we buy a computer in the first place?<br/><br/>I don't see why a Mac pro can not make use of the Oculus isn't it built for rendering video. I understand that it will not be able to run on iMac's and because of this the Oculus should be branded for Pro users due to the requirements and come at the price.<br/><br/>Now people are saying that your computer is doing ALL the heavy lifting, so why is the price point over $800 for something that isn't doing anything?<br/><br/>I'm excited about the direction of VR but not where it is at the moment.<br/><br/>Your display (which the Rift is) never does any of the heavy lifting. It's $800 because of what the display does; 110° viewing angle (still not human eye but much closer than other displays) with super low latency to reduce or eliminate motion sickness on a 1200x1800 per eye display for HD quality.<br/><br/>And yes, Mac's are very widely used for video rendering, but that rendering doesn't happen at 30+fps. It can take video rendering machines hours to render a single frame and sometimes years to render an entire movie. The final products, or pre-rendered material, is what then becomes 30+fps.<br/><br/>Thank you @TheRealFixxer<br/>Alot of what you say makes sense and some I was unaware of.<br/><br/>I guess I don't see VR as a game, but as an immersion and seeing Mac's are good at 3dcad and compiling video I would think they would be able to compile a scene well. I've even seen 3d renders of movie walk through. Creating a 3d world and placing cameras in areas to figure out how a scene would look<br/><br/>But I agree Mac's make more use of CPU cycles even by using there GPU's to help. WIth that said there are other directions one could take it. Like external thunderbolt video cards.<br/><br/>My big grip is the fact Octulas is looked at as a consumer product. If the requirements are that high, then it's more a pro product and needs to be advertized as that. I understand the technology is there but don't feel it's there to call it a consumer product.<br/><br/>Yes, you are right. Apple also has issues with software. Most aren't using "metal" the apple programming language which speeds up the processing for games because it's an Apple only solution where many use game engines that work on Microsoft Direct X or open source Opengl which most games use to run on Linux and oSX. Opengl is around 20% slower and sometime a lot more than that compared to direct x so a top of the line gaming card running in oSX runs as fast is a mid level gaming card in windows. So big problems not to mention most macs have built in cards that have no upgradability.<br/><br/>The mac pro is so different that Apple would have to do this as it wouldn't be worth a card vendor doing this as there is no profit in it for them with the small amount of possible buyers there would be for this. Apple doesn't like to loose money so I don't see this ever happening. Apple would loose money offering video card upgrades for mac pros.<br/><br/>Well he has a point though I do t care about oculus rift, rather wait for starVR. There should be an option to add better GPUs into an iMac and MacBook Pro. It is also sad that there is no more nVidia card, I liked the CUDA support now I will have to buy a PC and install Linux for my CUDA projects.<br/><br/>Gaming is a growing market and it won't be long until even iPhones have more GPU performance than the Macs. I agree that Apple should offer a high end GPU in a Mac<br/><br/>I am very bothered by the lack of high performance discrete graphics on Mac computers. Even the top of the like iMac uses an out of date mobile GPU which, of course, cannot be upgraded. If I want to develop software for VR, Apple has left me no choice but to buy or build a PC to run it on. As a big Apple fan (yes I admit it) this make me rather sad.<br/><br/>BTW, VR is not some passing fad. If you have tried it you know what I mean. VR is going to change gaming and content creation forever. My only worry about VR is that is too good. There could be millions of people that will become addicted to living and playing in virtual worlds. Look at how many people got addicted to MMOs that played on a flat screen. With VR you really feel like you are in the game.<br/><br/>Not worried about anything, i am pretty sure apple will have its own implementation for Mac and iOS when tech will be ready for consumers, right now it is more for hardcore users. Like always apple like to time its presence on right time, with right product. Have faith in apple.<br/><br/>It's funny that a lot of people know which vr is better based on os support. I guess you guys did heavy testing and now are the guy in the big electronic store that knows best.<br/><br/>HTC said it will bring support to the osx but that still needs to be seen.<br/><br/>I understand that a lot of you guys are stamped on there d**ks. But understand that Apple is more focused on laptops. And laptops can't be packed with more power than a PC, due to size, heat, power consumption etc.<br/><br/>He is right, even though he put it in **** terms. I love my Mac but Lord it needs a boost in graphics. Not that it needs to cost more but I would be more than willing to pay a little extra for a better graphics card or at least have the option to install my own. It's really too bad this guy had to make his statement sound like he is just plain uneducated. | CEO Oculus príde tvrdo na Mac podporu pre Rift<br/><br/>Generálny riaditeľ spoločnosti Oculus, Palmer Luckey, nenamáčal svoje slová, keď sa spýtal v rozhovore, či náhlavná súprava Rift VR niekedy podporí Mac. Ak ste dúfali, že to bude čoskoro, možno sa budete chcieť pripraviť na nejaké sklamanie.<br/><br/>To je na Apple. Ak niekedy uvoľnia dobrý počítač, urobíme to.<br/><br/>To, na čo sa tam odvoláva v menej diplomatickom zmysle, je diskrétna grafika potrebná na spustenie Riftu. Jednoduchá pravda je, že Apple jednoducho nechodí na špičkovú grafiku, ktorá splní požiadavky na náhlavnú súpravu. Pre kontext, na počítači so systémom Windows, potrebujete minimálne grafickú kartu NVIDIA GTX 970, grafickú kartu 300 dolárov.<br/><br/>Ako Luckey ďalej hovorí:<br/><br/>Je to len zmenšuje na skutočnosť, že Apple nemá prioritu high-end GPU. Môžete si kúpiť $ 6,000 Mac Pro s hornou líniou AMD FirePro D700, a to stále nezodpovedá našim odporúčaným špecifikáciám. Takže ak uprednostňujú GPU vyššej úrovne, ako tomu bolo v minulosti, radi by sme podporili Mac. Ale práve teraz neexistuje jediný stroj, ktorý by to podporoval.<br/><br/>Mac Pro nemôže byť obvinený z toho, že nebalí veľa konských síl, pretože to robí, ale rovnako FirePro grafika je zameraná viac na kreatívny trh, rovnako ako Mac Pro. Najmä Mac Pro ďaleko presahuje iné hardvérové požiadavky, ale prirodzene, pretože Rift je grafika ťažká, to je miesto, kde je nedostatok. Luckey je možno trochu prehnaný, ale rovnako je to muž za Riftom, takže nie je pochýb o tom, že veľa pravdy o tom, čo hovorí.<br/><br/>Čo hovoríte, majitelia Mac na svete? Ste dokonca obťažoval Oculus Rift, alebo je to niečo, čo si prajete, aby ste mohli mať? Zvuk off v komentároch nižšie!<br/><br/>Komentáre čitateľa<br/><br/>CEO Oculus príde tvrdo na Mac podporu pre Rift<br/><br/>Nie, neobťažoval som sa tým, pretože som naozaj neplánoval kúpiť Oculus Rift. Pre mňa je kategória produktu stále príliš skoro a príliš veľa vo fáze beta-kinda. Ale on sa zdvihne platný bod. Apple by sa mal snažiť dostať viac pred balíček CPU / GPU múdry. Práve teraz sú vždy pozadu.<br/><br/>Prepáčte, ale v čom je HTC Vive lepší? A Oculus Rift určite podporuje počítače s Linuxom, ktoré spĺňajú ich hardvérové špecifikácie! (Problém nie je operačný systém, ale hardvér.)<br/><br/>Tiež sa pozrite na to, prečo HTC Vive podporuje OS X: obsahuje viac vlastného hardvéru. (Čo je dôvod, prečo to stojí toľko.) Rift a Samsung Gear VR vyžadujú hardvér, do ktorého sa zapoja, aby mohli vykonávať viac ťažkých zdvíhaní.<br/><br/>VR nie je trik. 3D televízory nie vždy dávajú toľko 3D efektu a nefunguje to s každým. VR pracuje s každým a produkty Oculus a HTC Vive oficiálne vydanie nemajú takmer žiadnu latenciu, takže tam nie je žiadna pohybová choroba. K dispozícii je tiež veľa hernej podpory<br/><br/>Samozrejme, ak je hranie hier prioritou, vo všeobecnosti nie ste na trhu pre Mac. Nie veľa vývojárov hier podporuje OSX, takže tieto typy zariadení majú pravdepodobne obmedzené použitie na Macu (pre hry, pre ktoré bol Rift určený). Aspoň to je jediný dôvod, prečo by som ho nepoužil na pozeranie filmov.<br/><br/>Apple implementoval Metal engine do El Capitanu, môže existovať nejaký plán na vstup na herný trh (ako sa Apple dozvedel z iOS, aký veľký je tento trh, stačí sa pozrieť na najlepšie aplikácie).<br/>Takže teraz hardvér chýba a herné vývojári by pravdepodobne prejavili určitý záujem, pretože Macy sú teraz prijateľné množstvo používateľov Mac po celom svete.<br/><br/>Bol by som rád, keby sa Apple dostal do tohto odvetvia priemyslu. V súčasnosti nepoužívam žiadne produkty Apple, ale robia veľa správnych krokov v mnohých oblastiach a som veľmi zaujatý.<br/><br/>Navyše, konkurencia poháňa inovácie. Viem, že hlavná počítačová časť vyrába už vytvoriť, že konkurencia, ale Apple má RnD vôľu a peniaze, aby naozaj otočiť hlavy. Oni nemusia vyhrať čísla hry, pokiaľ ide o špecifikácie, oni vlastne len zriedka, ale väčšina ľudí, ktorí sa zaujímajú robiť výskum vedia, že výkon ! = súčet častí zariadenia. Apple môže urobiť viac s "menej". Na papieri sa ich produkty zdajú byť horšie, ale keď sa starostlivo vyvážený hardvér stretne so špecificky navrhnutým softvérom, zvyčajne vykonávajú rovnako dobre ako konkurencia, ak nie.<br/><br/>HA! Milujem, ako zrazu, s vysokým výkonom počítača nie je dôležité, aby Apple phans! Neexistuje jediný Mac schopný najvyššieho konca grafiky. Nemôže si kúpiť jeden, nemôže postaviť jeden. Mac nie je schopný byť najvyšší výkon a vy ste s tým dobrý. HA! Classic!<br/><br/>Kúpil som si MacBook Pro Retina v roku 2012, pretože obrazovky s vysokým rozlíšením a non-diskrétne GPU. Avšak, pre môj desktop som postavil systém s monitorom 4K, i7 4790K CPU, 3 GTX 970 GPU, a 16 GB pamäte všetko za menej, než to, čo by som zaplatil za iMac. Dokonca mám SSD nastaviť na zavedenie OSX. Môj bod je Apple mohol robiť podobné veci, ak by chcel, ale nie. V skutočnosti, pozrite sa na najnovšie iMac. Obsahuje diskrétnu grafiku a pomalú 5400 RPM jednotku. Môj počítač nemusí vyzerať tak pekne, a to nie je tak tenký, ale nakoniec je to užitočnejšie - nie je to dôvod, prečo sme si kúpiť počítač na prvom mieste?<br/><br/>Nevidím dôvod, prečo Mac Pro nemôže využiť Oculus nie je postavený na vykresľovanie videa. Chápem, že nebude môcť bežať na iMac a z tohto dôvodu by mal byť Oculus označený pre užívateľov Pro kvôli požiadavkám a prísť za cenu.<br/><br/>Teraz ľudia hovoria, že váš počítač robí všetky ťažké zdvíhanie, tak prečo je cena nad $ 800 za niečo, čo nerobí nič?<br/><br/>Som nadšený z smerovania VR, ale nie tam, kde je v súčasnosti.<br/><br/>Váš displej (ktorý je Rift) nikdy nerobí žiadne ťažké zdvíhanie. Je to 800 dolárov kvôli tomu, čo displej robí; 110° pozorovací uhol (stále nie ľudské oko, ale oveľa bližšie ako iné displeje) so super nízkou latenciou na zníženie alebo odstránenie pohybovej choroby na 1200x1800 na očný displej pre kvalitu HD.<br/><br/>A áno, Macy sú veľmi široko používané na vykresľovanie videa, ale toto vykresľovanie sa nestane pri 30 + snímkach za sekundu. To môže trvať hodiny video vykresľovacie stroje na vykreslenie jedného snímku a niekedy roky na vykreslenie celého filmu. Konečné produkty, alebo pre-rendered materiál, je to, čo sa potom stane 30 + snímok za sekundu.<br/><br/>Ďakujeme za odpoveď.<br/>Veľa z toho, čo hovoríte, dáva zmysel a niektoré som si neuvedomoval.<br/><br/>Myslím, že nevidím VR ako hru, ale ako ponorenie a vidieť Mac sú dobré na 3dcad a zostavovanie videa by som si myslel, že by boli schopní zostaviť scénu dobre. Dokonca som videl 3D vykreslenie filmu prejsť. Vytvorenie 3D sveta a umiestnenie kamier v oblastiach, aby ste zistili, ako by scéna vyzerala<br/><br/>Ale súhlasím Mac je, aby sa viac využívať CPU cyklov aj pomocou tam GPU je na pomoc. S tým, že povedal, že existujú aj iné smery, ktoré by sa dalo vziať. Rovnako ako externé blesk grafické karty.<br/><br/>Mojou veľkou priľnavosťou je skutočnosť, že Octulas je považovaný za spotrebiteľský produkt. Ak sú požiadavky také vysoké, potom je to skôr profesionálny produkt a musí byť takto reklamovaný. Chápem, že technológia je tam, ale nemám pocit, že je tam, aby sa to nazývalo spotrebný produkt.<br/><br/>Áno, máte pravdu. Apple má tiež problémy so softvérom. Väčšina nepoužíva "kovový" programovací jazyk Apple, ktorý urýchľuje spracovanie hier, pretože je to riešenie Apple, kde mnohí používajú herné motory, ktoré pracujú na Microsoft Direct X alebo open source Opengl, ktoré väčšina hier používa na spustenie na Linuxe a oSX. Opengl je asi o 20% pomalší a niekedy oveľa viac ako v porovnaní s priamym x, takže horná línia hernej karty beží v oSX beží tak rýchlo, ako je stredná úroveň hernej karty v oknách. Takže veľké problémy nehovoriac o väčšine Macov postavených v kartách, ktoré nemajú žiadnu modernizovateľnosť.<br/><br/>Mac Pro je tak odlišný, že Apple by to musel urobiť, pretože by to nestálo za to, aby to robil predajca kariet, pretože pre nich nie je žiadny zisk s malým množstvom možných kupujúcich. Apple nerád stráca peniaze, takže nevidím, že sa to niekedy deje. Apple by stratil peniaze, ktoré ponúkajú upgrade grafickej karty pre Mac profesionálov.<br/><br/>No, on má bod, aj keď nemám záujem o Oculus trhliny, skôr čakať na starVR. Tam by mala byť možnosť pridať lepšie GPU do iMac a MacBook Pro. Je tiež smutné, že nie je viac nVidia karta, páčila sa mi podpora CUDA teraz budem musieť kúpiť PC a nainštalovať Linux pre moje projekty CUDA.<br/><br/>Hranie hier je rastúci trh a nebude to trvať dlho, kým ani iPhony nebudú mať väčší výkon GPU ako počítače Mac. Súhlasím s tým, že Apple by mal ponúknuť high-end GPU v počítači Mac<br/><br/>Som veľmi obťažovaný nedostatkom vysoko výkonnej diskrétnej grafiky na počítačoch Mac. Dokonca aj vrchol ako iMac používa zastarané mobilné GPU, ktoré samozrejme nemožno inovovať. Ak chcem vyvíjať softvér pre VR, Apple mi neponechal inú možnosť, ako kúpiť alebo postaviť počítač, na ktorom ho spustím. Ako veľký fanúšik Apple (áno, priznávam to) to ma robí skôr smutným.<br/><br/>BTW, VR nie je nejaký prechodný výstrelok. Ak ste to vyskúšali, viete, čo mám na mysli. VR zmení hranie hier a tvorbu obsahu navždy. Moja jediná starosť o VR je, že je príliš dobrá. Tam by mohli byť milióny ľudí, ktorí sa stanú závislými na živote a hraní vo virtuálnych svetoch. Pozrite sa, koľko ľudí sa stalo závislými na MMO, ktoré hrali na plochej obrazovke. S VR máte naozaj pocit, že ste v hre.<br/><br/>Niet sa čoho obávať, som si istý, že Apple bude mať svoju vlastnú implementáciu pre Mac a iOS, keď bude technológia pripravená pre spotrebiteľov, práve teraz je to viac pre hardcore používateľov. Ako vždy jablko rád načasovať svoju prítomnosť na správny čas, so správnym produktom. Mať vieru v jablko.<br/><br/>Je to smiešne, že veľa ľudí vie, ktoré vr je lepšie založené na os podporu. Myslím, že ste urobili ťažké testovanie a teraz sú chlap vo veľkom elektronickom obchode, ktorý vie najlepšie.<br/><br/>HTC povedal, že prinesie podporu pre OSX, ale to ešte treba vidieť.<br/><br/>Chápem, že veľa z vás chlapci sú pečiatka na tam d**ks. Ale pochopiť, že Apple je viac zameraný na notebooky. A notebooky nemôžu byť balené s väčším výkonom ako PC, vzhľadom na veľkosť, teplo, spotrebu energie atď.<br/><br/>Má pravdu, aj keď to dal **** podmienok. Milujem svoj Mac, ale Pán potrebuje podporu v grafike. Nie že by to muselo stáť viac, ale bol by som viac ako ochotný zaplatiť trochu viac za lepšiu grafickú kartu alebo aspoň mať možnosť nainštalovať si vlastnú. Je to naozaj škoda, že tento chlapík musel urobiť svoje vyhlásenie, ako keby bol jednoducho nevzdelaný. |

| What Guys Said 19<br/><br/>No, it is because entertainment producers and product marketers want actors/actresses and models who look like the majority of the audience, so that they are relatable and therefore more effective sales tools. I am sure that Asian women look wonderful to Asian men. To me, as a white man, they have zero appeal.<br/><br/>@cowboy101 I am 100 per cent straight. I do not go outside of my race. When I was a soldier I had the "me love you long time" experience in Asia. That has left me feeling uncomfortable whenever there are Asian females near me. Sometimes I become profoundly uncomfortable, even though the particular individuals have done nothing to merit it. During a visit to Thailand, I found that the only way to prevent myself being propositioned on the street was to take white a female with me as a minder.<br/><br/>Aha the thing is that there isn't many white people (or any at all) in China, but in 'white' places, (or at least Australia) there are quite a lot of Asians around there, which made me think about this question...<br/><br/>Maybe in parts of the country where you stick at (remember, birds of a feather...), just like to republicans it seems that most people are republican etc. While it can only be small minority that you are surrounded by.<br/><br/>And as far as I know, there are a lot of whites in china, mainly by business, etc. But it's simple, most of people there are Asian, so they prefere Asian girls (dogs like dogs , cats like cats, most people prefere their own kind). And there is nothing wrong with that. Same is in white countries.<br/><br/>I think Asians are the most beautful. Unfortunately for me the 2 I got involved with in my life one was using me for my place/internet a long time ago and the recent one was a gold digging stupid bitch. She never graduated college and was 30. I would be extremely happy if I met a smart cute Asian woman near my age that was not a gold digger.<br/><br/>@Prettyapathetic yes because when a man loves deeply he always good with you on bed no matter size of tits or colour of skin and a real man always respect a girl in every relation like mother, sister, wife, girlfriend etc<br/><br/>as a model from childhood I got my start with a company called sugar & spice. I was recruited in Japan while my family was stationed there.<br/><br/>you get a job because they are going for a certain look, who are they targeting, and the area you live in.<br/><br/>I had to leave the industry last year because of health reasons. I worked with with many types of people, korean, Japanese, chinese, polish, german, American, Spanish, arabic. I've worked with children, adults, teenagers all of these ethnicities.<br/><br/>I am half white half Native American (Lakota) so they loved my look from a young age. but there are many beauty standards in the industry and not all of them are as portrayed, some being made to look worse, and some not taken seriously enough...<br/><br/>Nope, it's because the Asian men are jealous and angry and invent thousands of excuses every rare time who have Asian women in the media because they are jealous of Asian women, and Americans want to keep the status of white women, this is why the couples between Asian women and white men are boycotted and all other race with white women are pushed, it's white women wiht white men and white women with other races in American media, since it's opression and offensive for the ego of men of other race the women of own race with white but white women with other race is "anti-racism". You need to understand the American political social engineering all over these years of media, democrats, politics and propaganda.<br/><br/>Anyway, in countries like china, japan, korea they have Asian men and Asian women only and the only exceptions are when they import a white women to make some fantasy scene for them but it's not so much, it's forbiden expose the hatred and jealousy of some Asian men.<br/><br/>The Asian boys will be happy if you say something against other men, but they will be angry if you say that the Asian girl will die for the blond girl date the handsome caucasian/white dude, they will try to force Asian women to make anything against these men to these small vocal group of Asian men feel better in their hatred, excuses, racism and jealousy. This is why Asian women is not showed so much, it's because the Asian men will be angry, it's because the white women can't be replaced, and the American propaganda is around white women with white men, white women with other race, white women against white men for the other race of men, white women in everything.<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>1&#124;0<br/><br/>0&#124;0<br/><br/>Opinion Owner<br/><br/>1mo<br/><br/>All the excuses of media and propaganda and all lies for racism, jealousy and hate aren't used against white women by the same men who invent the excuses, white women all the time in the media, understand, the American social engineering is made by democrats, democrats hate white men, and the most popular couples would be white men and Asian women but it's horrible for a few group of white racists who are racists even against Asians, is bad for the angry Asian men and their excuses, is bad for the white women, the democrats really don't like white men and work hard to try to make the couple and anything wiht white men and non-white women be related to bad things while pushing white women and non-white men. It's a American political problem.<br/><br/>I think it's a opression against the ego of the men of other race, so the white guys need to look bad, be some sort of jokes, be soft, while the scenes with white women and other race is the opposite of the scenes of white men and non-white women | Čo ľudia hovoria 19<br/><br/>Nie, je to preto, že výrobcovia zábavy a obchodníci s produktmi chcú hercov / herečky a modely, ktoré vyzerajú ako väčšina publika, takže sú relatívne, a preto sú efektívnejšie predajné nástroje. Som si istý, že ázijské ženy vyzerajú úžasne pre ázijských mužov. Pre mňa, ako bieleho muža, nemajú žiadnu príťažlivosť.<br/><br/>Som stopercentne hetero. Nevychádzam z mojej rasy. Keď som bol vojakom, mal som skúsenosť s "ja ťa milujem dlho" v Ázii. To mi zanechalo nepríjemný pocit, keď sú blízko mňa ázijské ženy. Niekedy sa stávam hlboko nepohodlným, aj keď konkrétni jednotlivci neurobili nič, aby si to zaslúžili. Počas návštevy Thajska som zistil, že jediný spôsob, ako zabrániť tomu, aby som bol na ulici, bolo vziať so sebou bielu ženu ako opatrovateľku.<br/><br/>Aha vec je, že v Číne nie je veľa bielych ľudí (alebo vôbec žiadnych), ale na "bielych" miestach (alebo aspoň v Austrálii) je tam dosť Ázijcov, čo ma prinútilo premýšľať o tejto otázke ...<br/><br/>Možno v častiach krajiny, kde sa budete držať (pamätajte, vtáky peria...), rovnako ako republikáni sa zdá, že väčšina ľudí sú republikáni atď. Aj keď to môže byť len malá menšina, že ste obklopení.<br/><br/>A pokiaľ viem, v Číne je veľa bielych, hlavne podľa podnikania atď. Ale je to jednoduché, väčšina ľudí je ázijská, takže uprednostňujú ázijské dievčatá (psy ako psy , mačky ako mačky, väčšina ľudí uprednostňuje svoj vlastný druh). A na tom nie je nič zlé, rovnako je to aj v bielych krajinách.<br/><br/>Myslím, že Aziati sú najviac krásni. Bohužiaľ pre mňa 2 som sa zapojil do môjho života, ktorý ma používal pre moje miesto / internet pred dlhou dobou a nedávny bol zlato kopanie hlúpa suka. Nikdy absolvovala vysokú školu a bolo 30. Bol by som nesmierne šťastný, keby som stretol inteligentnú roztomilú ázijskú ženu v mojom veku, ktorá nebola zlatokopkou.<br/><br/>Prettyapatetic áno, pretože keď človek miluje hlboko, vždy s vami dobre na posteli bez ohľadu na veľkosť prsia alebo farbu kože a skutočný muž vždy rešpektuje dievča v každom vzťahu, ako je matka, sestra, manželka, priateľka atď<br/><br/>ako modelka som od detstva začínala so spoločnosťou s názvom sugar & spice. Bola som prijatá do Japonska, keď tam bola umiestnená moja rodina.<br/><br/>dostanete prácu, pretože idú na určitý vzhľad, na koho sa zameriavajú, a oblasť, v ktorej žijete.<br/><br/>Minulý rok som musel opustiť priemysel zo zdravotných dôvodov. Pracoval som s mnohými typmi ľudí, kórejskými, japonskými, čínskymi, poľskými, nemeckými, americkými, španielskymi, arabskými. Pracoval som s deťmi, dospelými, dospievajúcimi všetkými týmito etnikami.<br/><br/>Som napoly biely napoly domorodý Američan (Lakota), takže sa im páčil môj vzhľad od mladého veku. ale v priemysle existuje veľa štandardov krásy a nie všetky z nich sú tak zobrazené, niektoré sú vyrobené tak, aby vyzerali horšie a niektoré neboli brané dostatočne vážne...<br/><br/>Nie, je to preto, že ázijskí muži sú žiarliví a nahnevaní a vymýšľajú tisíce výhovoriek zakaždým, keď majú ázijské ženy v médiách, pretože žiarlia na ázijské ženy, a Američania chcú udržať status bielych žien, to je dôvod, prečo sú páry medzi ázijskými ženami a bielymi mužmi bojkotované a všetky ostatné rasy s bielymi ženami sú tlačené, je to bielych mužov a bielych žien s inými rasami v amerických médiách, pretože je to Musíte porozumieť americkému politickému sociálnemu inžinierstvu po celé tie roky médií, demokratov, politiky a propagandy.<br/><br/>Každopádne, v krajinách ako Čína, Japonsko, Kórea majú len ázijských mužov a ázijské ženy a jedinou výnimkou je, keď dovážajú biele ženy, aby pre nich vytvorili nejakú fantasy scénu, ale nie je to tak veľa, je to zakázané odhaliť nenávisť a žiarlivosť niektorých ázijských mužov.<br/><br/>Ázijskí chlapci budú šťastní, ak poviete niečo proti iným mužom, ale budú sa hnevať, ak poviete, že ázijské dievča zomrie pre blond dievča dátum pekný kaukazský / biely chlap, budú sa snažiť prinútiť ázijské ženy, aby niečo proti týmto mužom, aby tieto malé vokálne skupiny ázijských mužov cítiť lepšie vo svojej nenávisti, výhovorky, rasizmus a žiarlivosť. To je dôvod, prečo sa ázijské ženy toľko neukazujú, je to preto, že ázijskí muži sa budú hnevať, je to preto, že biele ženy nemôžu byť nahradené, a americká propaganda je o bielych ženách s bielymi mužmi, bielych ženách s inou rasou, bielych ženách proti bielym mužom pre druhú rasu mužov, bielych ženách vo všetkom.<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>1 – 0<br/><br/>0 – 0<br/><br/>Vlastník stanoviska<br/><br/>1mo<br/><br/>Všetky výhovorky médií a propagandy a všetky lži pre rasizmus, žiarlivosť a nenávisť sa nepoužívajú proti bielym ženám tými istými mužmi, ktorí vymýšľajú výhovorky, biele ženy po celý čas v médiách, pochopiť, americké sociálne inžinierstvo robia demokrati, demokrati nenávidia bielych mužov a najobľúbenejšie páry by boli bieli muži a ázijské ženy, ale je to hrozné pre niekoľko bielych rasistov, ktorí sú rasisti aj proti ázijským, zlé je zlé Je to americký politický problém.<br/><br/>Myslím, že je to útlak proti egu mužov inej rasy, takže bieli chlapci musia vyzerať zle, byť nejakými vtipmi, byť mäkkí, zatiaľ čo scény s bielymi ženami a inými rasami sú opakom scén bielych mužov a nebielych žien. |
