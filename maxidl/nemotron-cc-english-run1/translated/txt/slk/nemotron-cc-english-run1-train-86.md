| Leclaire<br/><br/>The historic Leclaire neighborhood, once referred to as Edwardsville's "suburb to the south," was founded as a cooperative community in 1890 and remained a separate village until annexed to the city of Edwardsville in 1934. Newspapers and magazines throughout the United States and Europe reported on the Leclaire experiment, particularly during the first 20 years of its existence. In 1979, due to its unique history, the former village was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.<br/><br/>Leclaire was founded by Nelson Oliver Nelson, a St. Louis plumbing manufacturer who, for many years, sought to advance the plight of the working class. Nelson wanted to improve working conditions for his employees and provide housing near the factories so workers and their families could easily participate in recreational and educational programs offered free of charge by the company. Prior to 1890, while still in St. Louis, the N. O. Nelson Company's manufacturing and distribution businesses began providing profit sharing along with educational and recreational opportunities. The Leclaire cooperative experiment would bring additional benefits.<br/><br/>When Nelson employees indicated they wanted to relocate to a rural location, company representatives approached leaders of small towns in several Missouri and Illinois communities near their St. Louis headquarters. They were looking for a suitable property to build new factories and a model village. South of Edwardsville they found a 125-acre tract of land with access to water, coal, and transportation. Local businessmen acted quickly to offer a financial incentive. In less than three weeks, the community raised a fund of $20,000 from individual contributions of between $1 and $1,000 to entice Nelson to choose Edwardsville for his enterprise.<br/><br/>City leaders had hoped to locate property inside the city limits of Edwardsville, but when no suitable site could be found, they were confident that the Nelson investment south of town would soon become a part of Edwardsville. Although Nelson fulfilled all the contingencies for construction and job creation in his contract, it would be 44 years before annexation to Edwardsville. Leclaire, bounded by Madison/Brown Avenues to the east, the railroad tracks to the west, Hadley/McKinley Avenues on the south and Wolf Street to the north, remained an independent village from 1890 to 1934. During that time it earned a reputation for innovations in business, education and residential planning.<br/><br/>The village of Leclaire on a 1931 map of Edwardsville<br/>Courtesy of Paul Jenkins<br/><br/>Nelson's decision to build a village was not made on a whim. By the late 1880s he was an international leader in the fields of cooperation and profit-sharing, exchanging social theories with others around the world while expanding his St. Louis business. He named his experimental village after the Parisian profit-sharer, Edme Jean Leclaire, but he visited many other social visionaries who provided information and inspiration. Compiling the best ideas from these examples, Nelson founded Leclaire to, in his words, "give work, promote intelligence, provide recreation, foster beauty, and make homes." These were all factors he determined necessary for men to lead fulfilling lives. Later writers used these words to formulate Leclaire's founding principles: Work, Homes, Education, Recreation, and Beauty, but with the additional important principle of Freedom.<br/><br/>Work<br/><br/>Work could be considered the most important of these factors since without the factory jobs in Leclaire, there would be no village. The brick factory buildings were designed by architect E. A. Cameron to provide natural light, ventilation in the summer, and heated floors in the winter. There was a fire suppression system and, although industrial accidents were not eliminated, every effort was made to guarantee the safety of the workers. The ivy-covered brick buildings were surrounded by well-manicured lawns and flower gardens giving the complex a campus-like appearance. In 1894, New York World reporter Nellie Bly called the buildings "the ideal perfection of buildings for man to labor in".<br/><br/>The manufacturing complex of the N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company in Leclaire<br/>From Friends of Leclaire<br/><br/>Nelson company policies were designed to protect the financial stability of employees. Workers could earn a share of the profits and have a voice in the company if they chose that option. The profit-sharing plan gave Nelson employees a pride of ownership that resulted in a supportive workforce. There were a few short-lived labor strikes over the years, but for the most part, labor problems were rare. Workers also had reasonable hours and competitive wages. There was a provident fund that provided for pensions and sick leave, as well as widow pensions if a worker died, whether or not the death was related to his employment.<br/><br/>Company headquarters for the N. O. Nelson Company (NONCO) remained in St. Louis, but all of the N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company was moved to Leclaire. The manufacturing company was divided into shops that made a variety of products. In 1900, the shops became independent companies for tax purposes, but all were still owned by the N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company. The shops included the Cabinet Mill where wood products from cabinetry to millwork were produced. The skilled craftsmen that worked here also fulfilled special contracts, including teller cages for a local bank and an altar still in use at St. Andrew's Episcopal Church in Edwardsville. The Marble Shop specialized in architectural marble that was cut and installed by Nelson crews in homes, businesses, and even state capitols throughout the Midwest. The Machine Shop, which became Bignall and Keeler, made pipe fitting machines, pumps, gauges, and various mechanical tools expected in the plumbing trade. They also branched out to manufacture specialty items like the Leclaire Bicycle in the mid-1890s. The Brass Shop included a foundry where various plumbing pipes and tools were manufactured. These examples represent just some of the work done in the Leclaire factories. The company's logo was a stylized "NONCO" that can still be seen on plumbing fixtures and some fire hydrants in Edwardsville today.<br/><br/>Homes<br/><br/>Before homes could be built, housing was needed for workers who were completing the factory buildings as well as building homes. To meet those needs, the company built the "Club House," a large building that served many purposes. In addition to lodging, it was the community's first educational building, and it contained a well-stocked library.<br/><br/>Construction of the residential portion of Leclaire began immediately after the village was founded in June of 1890. Julius Pitzman, the innovative landscape architect who laid out the first lots in Leclaire, set them up with a number of protective covenants. The covenants provided for wide, curvilinear streets, large lots, and a deed restriction that limited the properties to residential or educational purposes only. The company paved the streets, provided electric street lights, installed sidewalks, and planted hundreds of trees along the streets of Leclaire. Later sections of Leclaire were laid out with a conventional grid design and smaller lots, but still included the deed restrictions.<br/><br/>A Leclaire Victorian cottage in 1907<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Initially the homes were built by the company and then sold at near cost to Nelson employees to encourage home ownership. If a worker became ill and could not make his mortgage, payments were suspended until after he returned to work. The homes were offered in a variety of house designs and the company advertised that no two dwellings were alike. The earliest homes were primarily Victorian cottages that came with electricity and running water. These were followed by bungalows, foursquares, and even some kit homes. Residents could purchase a company-built home or buy an empty lot and build a house themselves, provided the architectural design met company standards.<br/><br/>In later years, lots were sold to investors, usually Edwardsville residents, and many homes in the 1920s were built by local contractors who then sold them to area residents.<br/><br/>Education<br/><br/>Nelson believed in education for everyone, including the working class. Educational programming began with a kindergarten at the Club House in 1892 and continued in the new educational building at 722 Holyoake Road. Commonly called the "School House," this building provided a large hall for meetings and programs, but had moveable partitions to divide it into classroom space during the day. In the evenings, there were dances, meetings, or programs of the Leclaire Self-Culture Club which featured weekly lectures by Washington University professors or nationally known speakers who, like N. O. Nelson, were part of the social betterment movement at the turn of the century. These included Jane Addams, Edward Everett Hale, Samuel "Golden Rule" Jones, and author Charlotte Perkins Gilman, among others.<br/><br/>Children enrolled in the Leclaire kindergarten in 1913<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>In the ten years following the 1895 construction of the education building, there were a series of educational experiments including an industrial school, college, night school, and an academy. The earliest and longest-lived endeavor was the morning kindergarten, founded in 1892, that used the Fröbel Model. This two-year program was free to everyone, including Edwardsville children, until 1931 when for financial reasons the company began charging tuition to students who were not the children of employees. Nelson Manufacturing operated a kindergarten until 1934 when the building was turned over to the Edwardsville School District for a nominal fee.<br/><br/>Recreation<br/><br/>Boaters on Leclaire Lake in 1915<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Recreation was an important feature of Leclaire. The company provided sports facilities for baseball, tennis, and later, football. A bowling and billiard hall was constructed and there was a lake for boating, swimming, fishing, or ice skating in winter. Leclaire Park was furnished with boathouses, male & female bath houses, and a large pavilion. Residents organized dances, hayrides, spelling bees, and other activities, and the company sponsored a band that played regularly at entertainments in the village or in Edwardsville. Like the educational functions at the Club House and School House, the recreational facilities at Leclaire were open to all and were often a destination for Edwardsville and even St. Louis visitors.<br/><br/>Beauty<br/><br/>Early photograph of Leclaire Lake<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>The last of the factors Nelson deemed important for a satisfying life concerned the environment. Nelson knew about the importance of healthy living. He valued the beauty and cleanliness that could be found in the country, and encouraged all in Leclaire to beautify their property by planting gardens and orchards. Nelson himself led by example, so a company greenhouse provided free flowers and competitions were held for the most beautiful yards. Leclaire was laid out so that the entire village had a park-like setting still evident today.<br/><br/>Freedom<br/><br/>The Leclaire Cooperative store<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Nelson listed five founding principles for Leclaire, but modern writers add a sixth: Freedom. All of the programs offered by the company were available to employees as well as local residents, but none were mandatory. The freedom to choose whether or not to participate in company programs was entirely up to the individual. Residents of Leclaire could work for Nelson Manufacturing or elsewhere, and workers were under no obligation to live in Leclaire. Participation in recreational and educational programs was also optional. There was also a company store where employees could shop, but unlike other company towns, no one was in debt to the company store. The Leclaire Store was a cooperative where members were charged fair market prices, but were then paid quarterly dividends.<br/><br/>A Different Company Town<br/><br/>All of these benefits made Leclaire unique from other company towns. But there were also individual instances where the company showed compassion and care for the employees. The company closed the factories and hired excursion trains to take workers and their families to St. Louis for a day at the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair. When money was tight, Nelson would occasionally place extra cash in each pay envelope to make life easier for workers, and if he instituted a program the men did not agree with, they talked it out and, as often as not, Nelson would reverse himself.<br/><br/>Born in Lillesand, Norway, in 1841, N. O. Nelson was a complicated man. He was a capitalist who believed in free enterprise, but also a socialist, a follower of the "Golden Rule", and a patriot who served for the Union in the Civil War. By 1900, he was a multimillionaire, but by the time of his death in 1922, he had given it all away for the betterment of the working class.<br/><br/>Although Leclaire was not Nelson's only social experiment, it is considered his most successful endeavor. Other major efforts for social betterment included a chain of co-operative grocery stores in New Orleans, a kindergarten for the children of black employees in his Bessemer, Alabama, factories, and a home for consumptives in Indio, California.<br/><br/>Nelson's Village of Leclaire was renowned internationally as a noteworthy and successful experiment. It was described in the New York World on numerous occasions but in particular by reporter Nellie Bly in 1894 who wrote at length about the model town where "The labor question is solved and everybody happy in a little village near St. Louis." The Los Angeles Times also regularly reported on N. O. Nelson, as did the Chicago Daily Tribune and numerous other publications.<br/><br/>In a speech at Leclaire's 15th anniversary celebration in 1915, Nelson said, "Leclaire extends to you a wide open hospitality, and bids you enjoy today the ease and comfort and beauty and inspiration which we enjoy every day." More than a century has passed since that day, but the invitation still stands. Residents and researchers are invited to learn about Leclaire's history and consider the lessons that might be learned for the betterment of future generations.<br/><br/>One of the former buildings of the manufacturing complex in 2019, which now serves as the N. O. Nelson Campus of Lewis and Clark Community College<br/>Photo by Ben Ostermeier<br/><br/>Friends of Leclaire, organized in 1990 following Leclaire's Centennial celebration, promotes the history of Leclaire through a website (historic-leclaire.org), publications, and a festival, Leclaire Parkfest, held annually on the third Sunday in October | Leclaire<br/><br/>Historická štvrť Leclaire, kedysi označovaná ako "predmestie na juhu" Edwardsville, bola založená ako družstevná komunita v roku 1890 a zostala samostatnou dedinou až do pripojenia k mestu Edwardsville v roku 1934. Noviny a časopisy po celých Spojených štátoch a Európe informovali o experimente Leclaire, najmä počas prvých 20 rokov jeho existencie. V roku 1979, kvôli svojej jedinečnej histórii, bola bývalá obec zapísaná do Národného registra historických miest.<br/><br/>Leclaire založil Nelson Oliver Nelson, výrobca inštalatérskych prác v St. Nelson chcel zlepšiť pracovné podmienky pre svojich zamestnancov a poskytnúť bývanie v blízkosti tovární, aby sa pracovníci a ich rodiny mohli ľahko zúčastňovať na rekreačných a vzdelávacích programoch, ktoré spoločnosť ponúka bezplatne. Louis, výrobné a distribučné podniky spoločnosti N. O. Nelson začali poskytovať zdieľanie zisku spolu so vzdelávacími a rekreačnými príležitosťami. Kooperatívny experiment Leclaire by priniesol ďalšie výhody.<br/><br/>Keď zamestnanci Nelson naznačili, že sa chcú presťahovať na vidiecke miesto, zástupcovia spoločnosti oslovili vedúcich malých miest v niekoľkých komunitách Missouri a Illinois v blízkosti ich ústredia v St. Hľadali vhodnú nehnuteľnosť na výstavbu nových tovární a vzorovej dediny. Na juh od Edwardsville našli 125-akrový pozemok s prístupom k vode, uhlie a dopravu. Miestni podnikatelia konali rýchlo, aby ponúkli finančné stimuly. Za menej ako tri týždne komunita získala fond vo výške 20 000 dolárov z individuálnych príspevkov vo výške od 1 do 1 000 dolárov, aby prilákala Nelsona, aby si vybral Edwardsville pre svoj podnik.<br/><br/>Vedúci predstavitelia mesta dúfali, že nájdu nehnuteľnosť v hraniciach mesta Edwardsville, ale keď sa nepodarilo nájsť žiadne vhodné miesto, boli presvedčení, že investícia Nelson južne od mesta sa čoskoro stane súčasťou Edwardsville. Hoci Nelson splnil všetky podmienky pre výstavbu a tvorbu pracovných miest v jeho zmluve, bolo by to 44 rokov pred pripojením k Edwardsville. Leclaire, ohraničená ulicami Madison/Brown na východe, železničnými traťami na západe, Hadley/McKinley Avenue na juhu a Wolf Street na severe, zostala nezávislou dedinou od roku 1890 do roku 1934. Počas tejto doby si získala reputáciu za inovácie v oblasti podnikania, vzdelávania a bytového plánovania.<br/><br/>Dedina Leclaire na mape Edwardsville z roku 1931<br/>Zdvorilosť Paul Jenkins<br/><br/>Nelsonovo rozhodnutie vybudovať dedinu nebolo urobené z rozmaru. Koncom 80. rokov 19. storočia bol medzinárodným lídrom v oblasti spolupráce a zdieľania zisku, výmeny sociálnych teórií s ostatnými po celom svete a rozširovania jeho podnikania v St. Louis. Svoju experimentálnu dedinu pomenoval po parížskom zdieľateľovi zisku, Edme Jean Leclaire, ale navštívil mnoho ďalších sociálnych vizionárov, ktorí poskytli informácie a inšpiráciu. Zostavujúc tie najlepšie nápady z týchto príkladov, Nelson založil Leclaire, aby svojimi slovami "dával prácu, podporoval inteligenciu, poskytoval rekreáciu, podporoval krásu a vytváral domovy." To všetko boli faktory, ktoré určil za nevyhnutné pre mužov, aby viedli napĺňajúci život. Neskorší spisovatelia používali tieto slová na formulovanie základných princípov Leclaire: Práca, Domovy, Vzdelávanie, Rekreácia a Krása, ale s ďalším dôležitým princípom slobody.<br/><br/>Práca<br/><br/>Práca by mohla byť považovaná za najdôležitejší z týchto faktorov, pretože bez pracovných miest v továrni v Leclaire by nebola žiadna dedina. Budovy tehlovej továrne boli navrhnuté architektom E. A. Cameronom, aby poskytovali prirodzené svetlo, vetranie v lete a vykurované podlahy v zime. Existoval systém na potlačenie požiaru a hoci priemyselné nehody neboli odstránené, vynaložilo sa všetko úsilie na zaručenie bezpečnosti pracovníkov. Tehlové budovy pokryté brečtanom boli obklopené dobre upravenými trávnikmi a kvetinovými záhradami, ktoré dávali komplexu vzhľad podobný areálu. V roku 1894 reportérka New York World Nellie Bly nazvala budovy "ideálnou dokonalosťou budov pre človeka, aby pracoval".<br/><br/>Výrobný komplex výrobnej spoločnosti N. O. Nelsona v Leclaire<br/>Priatelia Leclaire<br/><br/>Politika spoločnosti Nelson bola navrhnutá tak, aby chránila finančnú stabilitu zamestnancov. Pracovníci mohli získať podiel zo zisku a mať hlas v spoločnosti, ak sa rozhodli pre túto možnosť. Plán zdieľania zisku dal zamestnancom Nelson hrdosť na vlastníctvo, ktorá vyústila do podpornej pracovnej sily. V priebehu rokov došlo k niekoľkým krátkodobým štrajkom, ale z väčšej časti boli pracovné problémy zriedkavé. Pracovníci mali tiež primerané hodiny a konkurenčné mzdy. Tam bol prozreteľnostný fond, ktorý poskytoval dôchodky a nemocenskú dovolenku, ako aj vdovské dôchodky, ak pracovník zomrel, bez ohľadu na to, či smrť súvisela s jeho zamestnaním.<br/><br/>Sídlo spoločnosti N. O. Nelson Company (NONCO) zostalo v St. Louis, ale celá výrobná spoločnosť N. O. Nelson bola presunutá do Leclaire. Výrobná spoločnosť bola rozdelená na obchody, ktoré vyrábali rôzne výrobky. V roku 1900 sa obchody stali nezávislými spoločnosťami pre daňové účely, ale všetky boli stále vo vlastníctve N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company. Obchody zahŕňali Cabinet Mill, kde sa vyrábali výrobky z dreva od stolárstva až po mlyn. Zruční remeselníci, ktorí tu pracovali, tiež plnili špeciálne zmluvy vrátane pokladníckych klietok pre miestnu banku a oltára, ktorý sa stále používa v biskupskom kostole sv. Ondreja v Edwardsville. Mramorový obchod sa špecializoval na architektonický mramor, ktorý bol rezaný a inštalovaný posádkou Nelson v domácnostiach, podnikoch a dokonca aj štátnych hlavných mestách na celom stredozápade. Strojovňa, ktorá sa stala Bignall a Keeler, vyrábala potrubné armatúry, čerpadlá, meradlá a rôzne mechanické nástroje, ktoré sa očakávali v inštalatérskom obchode. V polovici 90. rokov 20. storočia sa tiež rozvetvili na výrobu špeciálnych položiek, ako je bicykel Leclaire. Mosadzný obchod zahŕňal zlievareň, kde sa vyrábali rôzne inštalatérske rúry a nástroje. Tieto príklady predstavujú len časť práce vykonanej v továrňach Leclaire. Logo spoločnosti bolo štylizované "NONCO", ktoré je stále možné vidieť na inštalatérskych zariadeniach a niektorých požiarnych hydrantoch v Edwardsville dnes.<br/><br/>Domovy<br/><br/>Predtým, ako bolo možné stavať domy, bolo potrebné bývanie pre pracovníkov, ktorí dokončovali továrenské budovy, ako aj stavali domy. Na uspokojenie týchto potrieb spoločnosť postavila "Club House", veľkú budovu, ktorá slúžila mnohým účelom. Okrem ubytovania to bola prvá vzdelávacia budova komunity a obsahovala dobre zásobenú knižnicu.<br/><br/>Výstavba obytnej časti Leclaire sa začala hneď po založení dediny v júni 1890. Julius Pitzman, inovatívny krajinný architekt, ktorý v Leclaire predstavil prvé pozemky, ich postavil s množstvom ochranných zmlúv. Zmluvy poskytovali široké, zakrivené ulice, veľké pozemky a obmedzenie na listiny, ktoré obmedzovalo nehnuteľnosti len na obytné alebo vzdelávacie účely. Spoločnosť vydláždila ulice, poskytla elektrické pouličné osvetlenie, inštalovala chodníky a zasadila stovky stromov pozdĺž ulíc Leclaire. Neskoršie časti Leclaire boli navrhnuté s konvenčným dizajnom mriežky a menšími časťami, ale stále zahŕňali obmedzenia listiny.<br/><br/>Leclaire viktoriánskej chaty v roku 1907<br/>Réžia Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Spočiatku domy boli postavené spoločnosťou a potom predané za takmer náklady zamestnancom Nelsona na podporu vlastníctva domu. Ak pracovník ochorel a nemohol si hypotéku, platby boli pozastavené až po návrate do práce. Domy boli ponúkané v rôznych dizajnoch domov a spoločnosť propagovala, že žiadne dva byty nie sú rovnaké. Najstaršie domy boli predovšetkým viktoriánske chaty, ktoré prišli s elektrinou a tečúcou vodou. Po nich nasledovali bungalovy, štvorcové a dokonca aj niektoré kitové domy. Obyvatelia si mohli kúpiť firemný dom alebo si kúpiť prázdny pozemok a postaviť dom sami, za predpokladu, že architektonický dizajn spĺňal firemné štandardy.<br/><br/>V neskorších rokoch boli pozemky predané investorom, zvyčajne obyvateľom Edwardsville, a mnoho domov v dvadsiatych rokoch 20. storočia bolo postavených miestnymi dodávateľmi, ktorí ich potom predali obyvateľom oblastí.<br/><br/>Vzdelávanie<br/><br/>Nelson veril vo vzdelávanie pre každého, vrátane pracujúcej triedy. Vzdelávacie programovanie začalo materskou školou v klubovom dome v roku 1892 a pokračovalo v novej vzdelávacej budove na 722 Holyoake Road. Bežne nazývaná "Školský dom", táto budova poskytovala veľkú sálu pre stretnutia a programy, ale mala pohyblivé priečky na rozdelenie do priestoru v triede počas dňa. Vo večerných hodinách sa konali tance, stretnutia alebo programy Leclaire Self-Culture Club, ktoré predstavovali týždenné prednášky profesorov Washingtonskej univerzity alebo národne známych rečníkov, ktorí, ako N. O. Nelson, boli súčasťou hnutia sociálneho zlepšenia na prelome storočia. Patrili medzi ne Jane Addamsová, Edward Everett Hale, Samuel "Golden Rule" Jones a autorka Charlotte Perkins Gilmanová.<br/><br/>Deti zapísané do materskej školy Leclaire v roku 1913<br/>Réžia Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>V desiatich rokoch po výstavbe budovy vzdelávania v roku 1895 sa uskutočnila séria vzdelávacích experimentov vrátane priemyselnej školy, vysokej školy, nočnej školy a akadémie. Najskoršie a najdlhšie trvajúce úsilie bola ranná škôlka, založená v roku 1892, ktorá používala Frébelov model. Tento dvojročný program bol voľný pre všetkých, vrátane detí Edwardsville, až do roku 1931, keď z finančných dôvodov spoločnosť začala účtovať školné študentom, ktorí neboli deťmi zamestnancov. Nelson Manufacturing prevádzkoval materskú školu až do roku 1934, kedy bola budova odovzdaná do školského obvodu Edwardsville za nominálny poplatok.<br/><br/>Rekreácia<br/><br/>Vodáci na jazere Leclaire v roku 1915<br/>Réžia Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Rekreácia bola dôležitou črtou Leclaire. Spoločnosť poskytovala športové zariadenia pre bejzbal, tenis a neskôr futbal. Bola postavená bowlingová a biliardová hala a v zime bolo jazero na člnkovanie, plávanie, rybolov alebo korčuľovanie. Leclaire Park bol vybavený člnmi, mužskými a ženskými kúpeľnými domami a veľkým pavilónom. Obyvatelia organizovali tance, hayrides, hláskovanie včiel a ďalšie aktivity a spoločnosť sponzorovala kapelu, ktorá pravidelne hrala na zábavách v dedine alebo v Edwardsville. Rovnako ako vzdelávacie funkcie v klubovom dome a školskom dome, rekreačné zariadenia v Leclaire boli otvorené pre všetkých a boli často destináciou pre návštevníkov Edwardsville a dokonca aj St.<br/><br/>Krása<br/><br/>Skorá fotografia jazera Leclaire<br/>Réžia Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Posledný z faktorov, ktoré Nelson považoval za dôležité pre uspokojujúci život, sa týkal životného prostredia. Nelson vedel o dôležitosti zdravého života. Vážil si krásu a čistotu, ktorú možno nájsť v krajine, a povzbudzoval všetkých v Leclaire, aby skrášlili svoj majetok výsadbou záhrad a sadov. Nelson sám vedený príkladom, takže firemný skleník za predpokladu, voľné kvety a súťaže sa konali pre najkrajšie dvory. Leclaire bol stanovený tak, aby celá dedina mala park-ako prostredie ešte zrejmé dnes.<br/><br/>Sloboda<br/><br/>Obchod Leclaire Cooperative<br/>Réžia Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Nelson uviedol päť základných princípov pre Leclaire, ale moderní spisovatelia pridávajú šiesty: Sloboda. Všetky programy ponúkané spoločnosťou boli k dispozícii zamestnancom, ako aj miestnym obyvateľom, ale žiadne neboli povinné. Sloboda rozhodnúť sa, či sa zúčastniť na firemných programoch alebo nie, bola úplne na jednotlivcovi. Obyvatelia Leclaire mohli pracovať pre Nelson Manufacturing alebo inde a pracovníci nemali žiadnu povinnosť žiť v Leclaire. Nepovinná bola aj účasť na rekreačných a vzdelávacích programoch. Bola tu aj firemná predajňa, kde mohli zamestnanci nakupovať, ale na rozdiel od iných firemných miest nebol nikto zadlžený do firemnej predajne. Obchod Leclaire bol družstvo, kde členovia boli účtované spravodlivé trhové ceny, ale potom boli vyplácané štvrťročné dividendy.<br/><br/>Iná firemná štvrť<br/><br/>Všetky tieto výhody urobili Leclaire jedinečným z iných podnikových miest. Ale boli tu aj individuálne prípady, keď spoločnosť preukázala súcit a starostlivosť o zamestnancov. Spoločnosť zatvorila továrne a najal exkurzie vlaky, aby pracovníkov a ich rodiny do St. Keď boli peniaze tesné, Nelson občas vložil do každej výplatnej obálky peniaze navyše, aby uľahčil život pracovníkom, a ak zaviedol program, s ktorým muži nesúhlasili, porozprávali sa a tak často, ako nie, Nelson sa obrátil.<br/><br/>Narodil sa v Lillesande v Nórsku v roku 1841, N. O. Nelson bol komplikovaný človek. Bol to kapitalista, ktorý veril v slobodné podnikanie, ale aj socialista, nasledovník "zlaté pravidlo" a vlastenec, ktorý slúžil pre Úniu v občianskej vojne. V roku 1900 bol multimilionárom, ale v čase svojej smrti v roku 1922 to všetko rozdal pre zlepšenie robotníckej triedy.<br/><br/>Hoci Leclaire nebol jediným Nelsonovým sociálnym experimentom, považuje sa to za jeho najúspešnejšie úsilie. Ďalšie hlavné úsilie o sociálne zlepšenie zahŕňalo reťazec kooperatívnych obchodov s potravinami v New Orleans, materskú školu pre deti čiernych zamestnancov v jeho Bessemer, Alabama, továrne a domov pre konzumentov v Indio, Kalifornia.<br/><br/>Nelsonova dedina Leclaire bola medzinárodne preslávená ako pozoruhodný a úspešný experiment. V New York World to bolo popísané pri mnohých príležitostiach, ale najmä reportérkou Nellie Blyovou v roku 1894, ktorá podrobne písal o modelovom meste, kde "Pracovná otázka je vyriešená a všetci sú šťastní v malej dedinke neďaleko St. Los Angeles Times tiež pravidelne informovali o N. O. Nelsonovi, rovnako ako Chicago Daily Tribune a mnoho ďalších publikácií.<br/><br/>V prejave na oslave 15. výročia Leclaire v roku 1915 Nelson povedal: "Leclaire vám ponúka širokú otvorenú pohostinnosť a ponúka vám dnes pohodlie a pohodlie a krásu a inšpiráciu, ktoré si každý deň užívame." Od toho dňa uplynulo viac ako storočie, ale pozvanie stále platí. Obyvatelia a výskumníci sú pozvaní, aby sa dozvedeli o histórii Leclaire a zvážili lekcie, ktoré by sa mohli naučiť pre zlepšenie budúcich generácií.<br/><br/>Jedna z bývalých budov výrobného komplexu v roku 2019, ktorá teraz slúži ako N.

Skype is a great option for schools/classes who aren't bringing in in-person authors, but who want to explore books and poetry, connect with an author, and ask one-on-one questions.<br/><br/>Cost<br/><br/>I offer 30-45-minute Zoom or Skype visits with schools for $125 per session (or $200 for two sessions happening within three hours in the morning or the afternoon; $325 for three sessions in one day; $425 for four sessions in one day). In each session, I try to get kids as actively involved as possible. No, it's not the same kind of connection as an in-person visit offers, but it can still be inspiring and motivating for kids!<br/><br/>What I Do<br/><br/>Each session for up to 50 students includes:<br/><br/>5 minutes of tech set-up<br/><br/>3 segments of 10ish-minutes each — You choose from:<br/><br/>How I became a writer<br/><br/>Writing this particular book (you choose which book I focus on)<br/><br/>Reading (I read some poems and kids help me read others)<br/><br/>Classroom presentation (your students put on a reading or performance for me—a very appreciative audience!)<br/><br/>Writing a poem together<br/><br/>Question and answer session<br/><br/>5 minutes of wrap-ups/goodbyes<br/><br/>I also chat with classes of pre-service teachers or groups of in-service teachers about poetry and writing.<br/><br/>Tips for a Great Virtual Visit<br/><br/>Tips for a Successful Virtual Visit<br/><br/>One of my goals for virtual school visits is to capture the interactivity that makes in-person visits successful and fun. But the truth is that sometimes it's tough to be virtually interactive! The timing might not sync up correctly, which makes reading together a challenge, and it's really hard for me to hear individual students unless they come up and speak directly into the microphone/computer. But after some trial and error, I've discovered some ways to have the best virtual visits possible. Here they are: 10 ways to make my visit with your students a great experience!<br/><br/>Before the Visit<br/><br/>Get kids as excited as possible about the visit. Visit my website with them. Read some of my books with them. Gather some questions students have for me. Anything you do ahead of time to make it feel like a BIG DEAL will go a long way toward student engagement.<br/><br/>Position the video camera or laptop with webcam so that I can see as much of the audience as possible. It's hard to assess student engagement when I can only see a couple of students.<br/><br/>Limit each group to 50 students. It's incredibly hard to engage large groups via video.<br/><br/>I'll move quickly from topic to topic or poem to poem. Please remind students that they'll need to listen closely to understand what's going on.<br/><br/>Occasionally, I do a little Reader's Theater with students. If I send you any scripted student parts ahead of time, print a copy for EACH session and cut into pieces, if needed.<br/><br/>During the Visit<br/><br/>When I discuss a book, if you have that printed book, please hold it up for students to see.<br/><br/>You are my proxy. I often can't call on students and hear individual replies. So, I might say, "We're going to get 3 ideas. Raise your hand if you have an idea." Then YOU take over, call on three students, and announce those answers to everyone in the room and to me.<br/><br/>Choose confident, outgoing students for scripted student parts (if I send any ahead of time). During my in-person school visits, I try to draw out some of the less confident students, but I've found that this doesn't work as well during virtual visits because I can't hear them.<br/><br/>Have students with speaking parts sit up front. When it's time, have them stand up and remind them to speak loudly.<br/><br/>In virtual visits, behavior management falls solely on you. I often can't see exactly what's going on, so do please step in as needed. If there's a big disruption, just ask me to hold on for a moment so that I don't chatter on while nobody's paying attention:>)<br/><br/>Feel free to take pictures of me on-screen and share on social media–even though pictures of me often look ridiculous because I'm making funny faces or something while I read!<br/><br/>If you have any questions at all, please just ask, either before or during the visit!<br/><br/>Scheduling a Virtual Session<br/><br/>Are you interested in scheduling a virtual visit with me? Just email me to set up a date, and we'll go from there | Autor Návštevy cez Zoom alebo Skype<br/><br/>Som nadšený, že môžem navštíviť vašich študentov cez Zoom alebo Skype! Skype je skvelou voľbou pre školy / triedy, ktoré neprinášajú osobne autorov, ale ktorí chcú preskúmať knihy a poéziu, spojiť sa s autorom a klásť otázky.<br/><br/>Náklady<br/><br/>Ponúkam 30-45-minútové návštevy Zoom alebo Skype so školami za 125 dolárov za sedenie (alebo 200 dolárov za dve sedenia, ktoré sa konajú do troch hodín ráno alebo popoludní; 325 dolárov za tri sedenia v jeden deň; 425 dolárov za štyri sedenia v jeden deň). Pri každom stretnutí sa snažím zapojiť deti čo najaktívnejšie. Nie, nie je to rovnaký druh spojenia ako osobné návštevy, ale môže to byť pre deti stále inšpirujúce a motivujúce!<br/><br/>Čo robím<br/><br/>Každé sedenie až pre 50 študentov zahŕňa:<br/><br/>5 minút technologického nastavenia<br/><br/>3 segmenty po 10 minútach - Vyberáte z:<br/><br/>Ako som sa stal spisovateľom<br/><br/>Písanie tejto konkrétnej knihy (vyberiete, na ktorú knihu sa zameriavam)<br/><br/>Čítanie (čítam básne a deti mi pomáhajú čítať iné)<br/><br/>Prezentácia v triede (vaši študenti si pre mňa pripravili čítanie alebo predstavenie - veľmi oceňujúce publikum!)<br/><br/>Napísať báseň spoločne<br/><br/>Otázky a odpovede<br/><br/>5 minút zábalov/zbohom<br/><br/>Tiež sa rozprávam s triedami predslužobných učiteľov alebo skupinami učiteľov v službe o poézii a písaní.<br/><br/>Tipy pre skvelú virtuálnu návštevu<br/><br/>Tipy pre úspešnú virtuálnu návštevu<br/><br/>Jedným z mojich cieľov pre virtuálne školské návštevy je zachytiť interaktivitu, ktorá robí osobné návštevy úspešné a zábavné. Ale pravdou je, že niekedy je ťažké byť virtuálne interaktívne! Načasovanie sa nemusí synchronizovať správne, čo robí spoločné čítanie výzvou a je pre mňa naozaj ťažké počuť jednotlivých študentov, ak neprichádzajú a nehovoria priamo do mikrofónu / počítača. Ale po niektorých pokusoch a omyloch som objavil niekoľko spôsobov, ako mať najlepšie virtuálne návštevy. Tu sú: 10 spôsobov, ako urobiť moju návštevu so svojimi študentmi skvelým zážitkom!<br/><br/>Pred návštevou<br/><br/>Získajte deti čo najviac nadšený o návšteve. Navštívte moje webové stránky s nimi. Prečítajte si niektoré z mojich kníh s nimi. Zhromaždiť niektoré otázky študenti majú pre mňa. Čokoľvek, čo urobíte vopred, aby ste sa cítili ako veľký obchod, pôjde dlhú cestu smerom k zapojeniu študentov.<br/><br/>Umiestnite videokameru alebo notebook s webovou kamerou tak, aby som mohol vidieť čo najviac divákov. Je ťažké posúdiť zapojenie študentov, keď môžem vidieť len pár študentov.<br/><br/>Obmedzte každú skupinu na 50 študentov. Je neuveriteľne ťažké zapojiť veľké skupiny prostredníctvom videa.<br/><br/>Prejdem rýchlo od témy k téme alebo básni k básni. Prosím, pripomeňte študentom, že budú musieť pozorne počúvať, aby pochopili, čo sa deje.<br/><br/>Príležitostne robím so študentmi malé Reader's Theater. Ak vám vopred pošlem nejaké napísané študentské časti, vytlačte si kópiu na KAŽDÉ sedenie a v prípade potreby nakrájajte na kúsky.<br/><br/>Počas návštevy<br/><br/>Keď diskutujem o knihe, ak máte tú vytlačenú knihu, prosím, podržte ju, aby ju študenti videli.<br/><br/>Ste môj zástupca. Často nemôžem zavolať na študentov a počuť jednotlivé odpovede. Takže by som mohol povedať, "Dostaneme 3 nápady. Zdvihnite ruku, ak máte nápad." Potom to prevezmeš ty, zavoláš troch študentov a oznámiš tieto odpovede všetkým v miestnosti a mne.<br/><br/>Vyberte si sebaistých, odchádzajúcich študentov pre skriptované študentské časti (ak pošlem nejaké vopred). Počas mojich osobných školských návštev sa snažím vytiahnuť niektorých menej sebavedomých študentov, ale zistil som, že to nefunguje tak dobre počas virtuálnych návštev, pretože ich nepočujem.<br/><br/>Nechajte študentov s hovoriacimi časťami sedieť vpredu. Keď je čas, nechajte ich vstať a pripomenúť im, aby hovorili nahlas.<br/><br/>Vo virtuálnych návštevách padá správa správania výhradne na vás. Často nevidím presne to, čo sa deje, takže sa prosím zapojte podľa potreby. Ak dôjde k veľkému narušeniu, požiadajte ma, aby som sa na chvíľu vydržal, aby som nekecal, kým nikto nevenuje pozornosť:>)<br/><br/>Neváhajte a odfoťte ma na obrazovke a zdieľajte na sociálnych médiách - aj keď moje fotografie často vyzerajú smiešne, pretože pri čítaní robím vtipné tváre alebo niečo!<br/><br/>Ak máte akékoľvek otázky, opýtajte sa, či už pred návštevou alebo počas nej!<br/><br/>Plánovanie virtuálnej relácie<br/><br/>Máte záujem o naplánovanie virtuálnej návštevy so mnou? Stačí mi poslať e-mail, aby sme si stanovili dátum, a odtiaľ pôjdeme |

On the one hand it has prompted stigma and violence and on the other it has brought about constructive and supportive responses from various individuals and groups. A new book, Acting on HIV, edited by Prof. Dennis Francis, Dean of the Faculty of Education at the University of the Free State, looks at how drama can be used to promote vital social change as well as individual behavioural change.<br/><br/>Acting on HIV offers a systematic inquiry into drama as an approach to discuss HIV/AIDS and related attitudes and behaviours. The book is a scholarly text and includes the work of some twenty exceptionally creative authors. Contributing authors to the book include, amongst others, Proff. Hazel Barnes (University of the Witwatersrand), Rob Pattman (Stellenbosch University) and Yvonne Sliep from the University of KwaZulu-Natal.<br/><br/>"This project started in 2009 and has taken much of my time to bring together the work of exceptionally creative authors. The research that is communicated through the book is original and timely and makes a significant contribution to conversations about the role/s and significance of drama in addressing issues of HIV & AIDS," says Prof. Francis | Archív noviniek<br/><br/>Nová kniha sa zameriava na spôsoby, ako bojovať proti HIV-výzvy<br/><br/>2011-11-29<br/><br/>Prof. Dennis Francis s Marjorie Human, ktorý navrhol obálku knihy, Hranie na HIV.<br/><br/>Pandémia HIV priniesla to najlepšie a najhoršie u ľudí, pokiaľ ide o reakciu. Na jednej strane to vyvolalo stigma a násilie a na druhej strane to prinieslo konštruktívne a podporné reakcie od rôznych jednotlivcov a skupín. Nová kniha Acting on HIV, ktorú vydal prof. Dennis Francis, dekan Pedagogickej fakulty Univerzity Slobodného štátu, sa zaoberá tým, ako môže byť dráma použitá na podporu životne dôležitých spoločenských zmien, ako aj individuálnych zmien správania.<br/><br/>Pôsobenie na HIV ponúka systematické skúmanie drámy ako prístupu k diskusii o HIV/AIDS a súvisiacich postojoch a správaní. Kniha je vedeckým textom a zahŕňa prácu asi dvadsiatich mimoriadne kreatívnych autorov. Medzi prispievajúcich autorov knihy patria okrem iného Proff. Hazel Barnes (University of the Witwatersrand), Rob Pattman (Stellenbosch University) a Yvonne Sliep z univerzity v KwaZulu-Natal.<br/><br/>"Tento projekt začal v roku 2009 a venoval som mu veľa času, aby spojil prácu mimoriadne kreatívnych autorov. Výskum, ktorý je komunikovaný prostredníctvom knihy, je originálny a včasný a významne prispieva k rozhovorom o úlohe / úlohách a význame drámy pri riešení problémov HIV a AIDS, "hovorí profesor Francis. |

| Storyworld Spotlight<br/><br/>25 years of Tomb Raider<br/><br/>Tomb Raider is one of the most recognizable entertainment properties in the world. Since Lara Croft's first videogame appearance in Tomb Raider (1996), her exploits as an adventurous and quick-witted explorer have resonated widely with players, earning her a place in the pantheon of great pop culture characters. For that reason we will be putting The World of Lara Croft in the Storyworld Spotlight from December 22, 2021 to March 6, 2022.<br/><br/>Crafting a Croft<br/><br/>Lara Croft was created by studio Core Design, in Derby (UK), in 1996. The studio was looking for a lead character for their upcoming a 3D adventure game for PlayStation 1. A game in a 3rd person perspective where players would see the main character in full throughout every scene.<br/><br/>As the game was about 'raiding mysterious tombs deep under pyramids,' the lead character would need to look adventurous, and have the brains to survive complex raiding missions. After some deliberation, Lara Croft was born, a young, upper-class and utterly British woman, who was as enigmatic and intelligent as she was tough and self-reliant.<br/><br/>Success and controversy<br/><br/>Tomb Raider (1996) was a breakaway success for Core Design, who quickly doubled down on building Tomb Raider 2 (1997) and 3 (1998). A big part of the success was attributed to the games' leading lady, who found admirers both with male and female players. This baffled critics who just saw Lara Croft as a sexist cartoon.<br/><br/>Explore The World of Lara Croft in Storyworld<br/><br/>This exhibition explores the successful franchise in-depth. It looks at the history of the games and why its leading lady resonates with so many people. It also dives into the mystery of what makes Tomb Raider games tick, from the deep world building to the clever puzzles and traps, and from fantastic enemy and monster designs to the character design of the legendary heroine.<br/><br/>After all, mysteries are there to explore, and have been for the past 25 years.<br/><br/>Tickets<br/><br/>Buy your tickets for Storyworld online with a start date and entry time from Wednesday December 22.

Odkedy sa Lara Croft objavila v Tomb Raider (1996), jej hrdinské činy ako dobrodružný a šikovný prieskumník rezonovali s hráčmi a získali jej miesto v panteóne veľkých postáv popkultúry. Z tohto dôvodu uvedieme The World of Lara Croft do Storyworld Spotlight od 22. decembra 2021 do 6. marca 2022.<br/><br/>Vytvoriť Croft<br/><br/>Lara Croft bola vytvorená štúdiom Core Design v Derby (Veľká Británia), v roku 1996. Štúdio hľadalo hlavnú postavu pre svoju nadchádzajúcu 3D dobrodružnú hru pre PlayStation 1. Hra v perspektíve tretej osoby, kde by hráči videli hlavnú postavu v plnom rozsahu počas každej scény.<br/><br/>Vzhľadom k tomu, že hra bola o "nájazde tajomných hrobiek hlboko pod pyramídami", hlavná postava by musela vyzerať dobrodružne a mať mozgy, aby prežila zložité nájazdové misie. Po nejakom zvažovaní sa narodila Lara Croft, mladá, vyššia trieda a úplne britská žena, ktorá bola taká tajomná a inteligentná, ako bola tvrdá a sebestačná.<br/><br/>Úspech a kontroverzia<br/><br/>Tomb Raider (1996) bol odtrhnutý úspech pre Core Design, ktorý sa rýchlo zdvojnásobil na budove Tomb Raider 2 (1997) a 3 (1998). Veľká časť úspechu bola pripísaná vedúcej dáme hier, ktorá našla obdivovateľov s mužskými aj ženskými hráčmi. Toto nepochopené kritiky, ktorí práve videli Laru Croft ako sexistickú karikatúru.<br/><br/>Preskúmajte svet Lary Croft v Storyworld<br/><br/>Táto výstava skúma úspešnú franšízu do hĺbky. Pozerá sa na históriu hier a prečo jej vedúca dáma rezonuje s toľkými ľuďmi. Tiež sa ponorí do tajomstva toho, čo robí hry Tomb Raider kliešťami, od budovania hlbokého sveta až po chytré hádanky a pasce a od fantastických nepriateľských a monštier dizajnov až po dizajn postáv legendárnej hrdinky.<br/><br/>Koniec koncov, záhady sú tam, aby preskúmali, a to bolo za posledných 25 rokov.<br/><br/>Lístky<br/><br/>Kúpte si vstupenky na Storyworld online s dátumom začiatku a vstupným časom od stredy 22.

| Real Estate Word of the Day: Option<br/><br/>Option: An agreement to keep open, for a set period, an offer to sell or lease real property. An option can be used, for example, to give the buyer time to resolve questions of financing, title, zoning and feasibility before committing the buyer to purchase. Options are frequently used in the land assemblage process. The option must be supported by its actual consideration, separate and independent of the purchase price of the property. Mere recital of consideration alone is not sufficient except in a lease-option in which the provisions of the lease are themselves sufficient consideration to support the option. An option merely creates a contractual right; it does not give the optionee any estate in the property. At the time the option is signed, the owner does not sell, nor does the buyer purchase, the property. Although the owner is obligated to sell if given notice by the buyer, the buyer is not obligated to purchase. An option to buy is also known as a call; an option to sell is known as a put. | Realitné slovo dňa: Option<br/><br/>Možnosť: Dohoda o ponechaní otvorenej ponuky na predaj alebo prenájom nehnuteľností na dobu určitú. Možnosť môže byť použitá napríklad na to, aby kupujúci mal čas vyriešiť otázky financovania, vlastníctva, územného plánovania a uskutočniteľnosti predtým, ako sa kupujúci zaviaže k nákupu. Možnosti sa často používajú v procese zhromažďovania pozemkov. Možnosť musí byť podporená jej skutočnou protihodnotou, oddelenou a nezávislou od kúpnej ceny nehnuteľnosti. Samotné odôvodnenie protihodnoty nestačí, s výnimkou možnosti lízingu, v ktorej samotné ustanovenia lízingu postačujú na podporu možnosti. Opcia iba vytvára zmluvné právo; neposkytuje opcii žiadnu nehnuteľnosť v nehnuteľnosti. V čase podpísania opcie vlastník nepredáva, ani kupujúci nekupuje nehnuteľnosť. Aj keď je majiteľ povinný predať, ak to kupujúci oznámi, kupujúci nie je povinný kúpiť. Opcia na kúpu je tiež známa ako volanie; opcia na predaj je známa ako put. |
| Benefits of Carotenoids for the Skin<br/><br/>Have you heard of carotenoids? These powerful phytochemicals are the pigmented constituents found in plants that give flowers, fruits, and leaves their yellow, orange and red colours.<br/><br/>Since the 1930s, scientists have identified about 800 carotenoids and about 40 are found in the human body, including the outermost layer of the epidermis, the dermis and subcutaneous fat. The most common carotenoids are beta-carotene, alpha-carotene, lutein, zeaxanthin, lycopene, and astaxanthin. You can read more about astaxanthin here.<br/><br/>The content of carotenoids in the skin is influenced by numerous factors, including the intake of fruits and vegetables, their bioavailability from various foods, supplementation, exposure to UV radiation, air pollution, alcohol consumption, smoking and stress.<br/><br/>How do Carotenoids Help My Skin?<br/><br/>Carotenoids are some of the best-known antioxidants for the skin and they also have important functions as anti-inflammatory agents.<br/><br/>Healthy Aging and Skin Repair<br/><br/>Antioxidants are essential for healthy skin because they help to prevent free radical damage to cells. Free radical damage causes premature aging and the onset of various types of skin cancers. Carotenoids, along with vitamin E, vitamin C, and Co enzyme Q10 are important dermal antioxidants.<br/><br/>Due to their antioxidant activity, carotenoids support and encourage collagen and elastin production in the skin. This helps to increase the skin's density, thickness, elasticity, and firmness. Collagen and elastin decrease as we age, so getting enough carotenoids in the diet and topically is critical for aging well.<br/><br/>Carotenoids can improve the signs of photoaging, skin discolouration, elasticity, hydration, texture, and can reduce transepidermal water loss.<br/><br/>Astaxanthin in particular stimulates fibroblasts to produce collagen and elastin, inhibits the activity of the enzymes that breakdown collagen and elastin, and shows anti-inflammatory and UV-filtering effects. It has been shown to reduce melanin in the skin, which results in the decrease in the appearance of freckles and melasma.<br/><br/>Anti-acne activity: the anti-inflammatory activity of carotenoids helps to dampen the inflammation and irritation associated with acne. Carotenoids also help to normalize and balance oil secretions from the sebaceous glands. They are valuable agents in skin repair and they stimulate epidermal regeneration, helping to smooth and soften skin.<br/><br/>Where Can I Find Carotenoids?<br/><br/>There are two ways to get your daily dose of carotenoids: through diet and through topical application. The combination of both is the ideal approach to well-aging skincare.<br/><br/>Carotenoids are fat-soluble, so your body needs fat to absorb them (think tomatoes and olive oil, broccoli and butter, or spinach and avocado). Common sources of carotenoids in food are avocado, egg yolks, kale, spinach, carrots, sweet potatoes, papaya, and tomatoes.<br/><br/>While we advocate getting as many of your nutrients and antioxidants as you can from food rather than supplementation; one study showed that astaxanthin combined with collagen hydrolysate significantly improved barrier integrity, reduced transepidermal water loss, and increased the expression of procollagen type I mRNA.<br/><br/>Topical application is key to healthy skin. Studies show that high concentrations of antioxidants in human skin offer the best protection for healthy skin at any age.<br/><br/>At Sarka Botanicals, we blend carotenoid-rich, whole plants such as calendula, dandelion, and extracts like astaxanthin with cold-pressed oils and functional ingredients. Calendula alone contains over 19 different types of carotenoids. This may explain why it has such a long history of use in skin care. Studies show that carotenoids blended with co-enzyme Q10 are especially effective at reducing inflammation and slowing premature skin aging due to sun exposure. | Výhody karotenoidy pre pokožku<br/><br/>Počuli ste už o karotenoidech? Tieto silné fytochemikálie sú pigmentované zložky, ktoré sa nachádzajú v rastlinách, ktoré dávajú kvety, ovocie a zanechávajú ich žltú, oranžovú a červenú farbu.<br/><br/>Od roku 1930 vedci identifikovali asi 800 karotenoidy a asi 40 sa nachádza v ľudskom tele, vrátane vonkajšej vrstvy epidermis, dermis a podkožného tuku. Najbežnejšie karotenoidy sú beta-karotén, alfa-karotén, luteín, zeaxantín, lykopén a astaxantín. Viac o astaxantíne si môžete prečítať tu.<br/><br/>Obsah karotenoidy v koži je ovplyvnený mnohými faktormi, vrátane príjmu ovocia a zeleniny, ich biologickej dostupnosti z rôznych potravín, suplementácia, vystavenie UV žiareniu, znečistenie ovzdušia, konzumácia alkoholu, fajčenie a stres.<br/><br/>Ako karotenoidy pomáhajú mojej pokožke?<br/><br/>Karotenoidy sú jedny z najznámejších antioxidantov pre pokožku a majú tiež dôležité funkcie ako protizápalové látky.<br/><br/>Zdravé starnutie a oprava kože<br/><br/>Antioxidanty sú nevyhnutné pre zdravú pokožku, pretože pomáhajú predchádzať poškodeniu voľnými radikálmi buniek. Poškodenie voľnými radikálmi spôsobuje predčasné starnutie a nástup rôznych typov rakoviny kože. Karotenoidy, spolu s vitamínom E, vitamínom C a enzýmom Co Q10 sú dôležité dermálne antioxidanty.<br/><br/>Vďaka svojej antioxidačnej aktivite karotenoidy podporujú a podporujú tvorbu kolagénu a elastínu v pokožke. To pomáha zvyšovať hustotu, hrúbku, pružnosť a pevnosť pokožky. Kolagén a elastín klesajú, ako starneme, takže dostatok karotenoidy v strave a topicky je rozhodujúce pre starnutie dobre.<br/><br/>Karotenoidy môžu zlepšiť príznaky fotostárnutia, zmeny farby pokožky, elasticity, hydratácie, textúry a môžu znížiť transepidermálnu stratu vody.<br/><br/>Najmä astaxantín stimuluje fibroblasty na produkciu kolagénu a elastínu, inhibuje aktivitu enzýmov, ktoré odbúravajú kolagén a elastín, a vykazuje protizápalové a UV filtračné účinky. Bolo preukázané, že znižuje melanín v koži, čo vedie k zníženiu vzhľadu pih a melazmy.<br/><br/>Aktivita proti akné: protizápalová aktivita karotenoidov pomáha tlmiť zápal a podráždenie spojené s akné. Karotenoidy tiež pomáhajú normalizovať a vyvážiť sekréty oleja z mazových žliaz. Sú cennými činidlami pri oprave pokožky a stimulujú epidermálnu regeneráciu, čo pomáha vyhladiť a zjemniť pokožku.<br/><br/>Kde môžem nájsť karotenoidy?<br/><br/>Existujú dva spôsoby, ako dostať svoju dennú dávku karotenoidov: prostredníctvom stravy a prostredníctvom lokálnej aplikácie. Kombinácia oboch je ideálnym prístupom k starostlivosti o pleť.<br/><br/>Karotenoidy sú rozpustné v tukoch, takže vaše telo potrebuje tuk, aby ich absorbovalo (myslite na paradajky a olivový olej, brokolicu a maslo alebo špenát a avokádo). Bežné zdroje karotenoidy v potravinách sú avokádo, vaječné žĺtky, kapusta, špenát, mrkva, sladké zemiaky, papája a paradajky.<br/><br/>Zatiaľ čo my obhajujeme získanie čo najviac živín a antioxidantov, ako môžete z potravy, skôr ako suplementácia; jedna štúdia ukázala, že astaxantín v kombinácii s hydrolyzátom kolagénu výrazne zlepšil integritu bariéry, znížil transepidermálnu stratu vody a zvýšil expresiu prokolagénu typu I mRNA.<br/><br/>Lokálna aplikácia je kľúčom k zdravej pokožke. Štúdie ukazujú, že vysoké koncentrácie antioxidantov v ľudskej pokožke ponúkajú najlepšiu ochranu pre zdravú pokožku v každom veku.<br/><br/>V spoločnosti Sarka Botanicals miešame celé rastliny bohaté na karotenoidy, ako je nechtík, púpava a výťažky ako astaxantín so za studena lisovanými olejmi a funkčnými zložkami. Samotný nechtík obsahuje viac ako 19 rôznych typov karotenoidov. To môže vysvetliť, prečo má takú dlhú históriu používania v starostlivosti o pleť. Štúdie ukazujú, že karotenoidy zmiešané s koenzýmom Q10 sú obzvlášť účinné pri znižovaní zápalu a spomaľovaní predčasného starnutia pokožky v dôsledku vystavenia slnku. |
