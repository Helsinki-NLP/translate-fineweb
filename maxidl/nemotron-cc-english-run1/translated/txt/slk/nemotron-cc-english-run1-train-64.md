| Smith Chuck - Through the Bible C2000 SeriesShall we turn to the book of Acts, chapter one, as we begin our study of the early church.<br/>Luke, the author of the book of Acts, a companion of Paul the apostle, who was author also of the Gospel According to Luke, wrote these two treatises to a friend, Theophilus. Theophilus is a Greek name. It's a name that has a beautiful meaning. The name means lover of God. There are some who believe that it was not a man at all, but that the gospel and the book of Acts were addressed to the lovers of God, whoever you may be. There are other traditions that say that Theophilus was actually Luke's master. That in those days physicians were slaves, usually the slave of a wealthy patron. So that Luke's master was Theophilus, and he released Luke to be with Paul on the missionary journeys. Thus, Luke is writing back to his former master. This is an early tradition of the church, but it is, of course, impossible to prove, like so many of the traditions.<br/>There are also those who believe that when Paul was in Troas and he received a vision of a man calling unto him saying, "Come over to Macedonia and help us," that that man in Paul's vision was none other than Luke. For the first one that Paul really met when he came to Macedonia was Luke. And as we are in the book of Acts, you will find that when we get to that portion of the book of Acts, Luke begins to write more in the first person rather than the third person. So it is, evidently, at this particular point in the Acts of the Apostles that Luke became a companion of Paul and began to journey with him. He began to use the pronouns "we" and "us" instead of "they" and "them." This is, no doubt, where Luke became a participant and an eyewitness of those things that were happening from this point on. We will bring this out to you when we get to that point.<br/>He begins the Acts of the Apostles by tying it with the Gospel According to Luke. It is interesting that the very last thing that Luke records in his gospel is the very first thing he records in the Acts of the Apostles. We find the gospel of Luke closing as Jesus is telling His disciples to wait in Jerusalem until they be endued with power from on high. And then Jesus ascended up into heaven, and so he closes the gospel. In opening the Acts of the Apostles, he writes,<br/>The former treatise [that is, the Gospel According to Luke,] have I written unto you, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and teach ( Act 1:1 ),<br/>The key word is began. The Gospel According to Luke is not the full story of the ministry of Jesus Christ. It is only the beginning of the ministry of Jesus Christ. Jesus continues to minister to the needs of people. Jesus continues to heal the sick. Jesus continues to raise the dead. Jesus continues to minister His love and His gospel to the world, only now He is ministering through those disciples who have been anointed with His Holy Spirit. But the ministry of Christ is continuing; basically, is the premise that Luke takes in the Acts of the Apostles. The former treatise of all that Jesus began, both to do and to teach.<br/>Now because of that, the Acts of the Apostles is an unfinished book: in that the Lord today continues to work through the lives of those who have dedicated themselves to be the instruments of God. To be led and guided and anointed by His Holy Spirit, to continue the ministry of Jesus in the world today. Now God has ordained that His work should be accomplished through human instruments. I do not say that it must be accomplished. God can use angelic beings for His work, and there will come a time, during the book of Revelation when God will use angels to proclaim His gospel to people all over the world. Revelation, chapter 14, "The first angel flying through the midst of heaven having the everlasting gospel" ( Rev 14:6 ). But at the present time, God has chosen to use human instruments. As imperfect as they may be, yet that's what God has ordained to use. The exciting thing about that is, God will use me and God will use you. So many times, we're begging off, "O Lord, I can't speak. I've never been able to speak before or even now, Lord." As Moses tried to beg off the call of God. Jeremiah said, "Lord, I'm just a kid; no one's going to listen to me." And we all have our excuses why we can't be used. Don't we? We all know the reasons why God couldn't use us.<br/>One time, as the Lord was calling a prophet to do His work, he said, "Lord, send whoever you want." The Lord said, "Hey, I've called you." "Lord, good idea; send whoever you want." So often we're in that position, "Lord, send by the hand of whomsoever you will, anybody but me Lord." And yet, God has ordained to use us.<br/>Now, each of us can show our own imperfections. Each of us can point out our own inabilities, and all of us can find an excuse why God wouldn't want to use me. But yet, God has chosen to use you. That through your life He might reveal Himself to a needy world. You wonder when God has such instruments to use how He ever got the job done, don't you?<br/>Until the day in which he was taken up, after that he through the Holy Spirit had given commandments to the apostles whom he had chosen ( Act 1:2 ):<br/>That is what he ended the Gospel of Luke with. The day that Jesus was taken up, after He had told the apostles to wait for the endowment of power.<br/>To whom he also [that is the apostles he also] showed himself alive to them after his passion [or death] by many infallible proofs ( Act 1:3 ),<br/>It is difficult to deny the fact of the resurrection of Jesus Christ. I was amused, as well as annoyed and irritated, by an article I read in the Santa Ana Register this last Saturday. Of the creation science and evolutionary theories being presented in the county schools. How that, this one professor said that he teaches a science class, and thus, they deal only in facts, and that they don't have any place for theories. Because science is based upon fact and creation is based upon religious superstitions. It takes a lot of faith to believe the religious theories. When you are dealing with facts, you can just accept them. I thought, "Very interesting in that science class, they taught me it was a fact that the world was four billion years old. Now today they are teaching it's a fact that the world is twelve billion years old. And it wasn't that long ago that I went to school."<br/>It's interesting that the Bible has never needed to be revised or updated to meet the current data that men have discovered. And yet, if you would take my high school science textbooks today and try to teach a science class from them, you would find that many of the things that were taught as scientific fact when I was in high school are no longer recognized as scientific fact. The simple cell protoplasm is no longer a simple cell, but extremely complex. If there is any fact that can be attested to in history it is the fact of the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.<br/>We have a jurisprudence system that is based upon the testimony of witnesses. If a man is accused of a crime and there are people who witnessed that crime while it was being committed, and they are brought to the standard, and they swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help them God. And in their questioning they affirm that, "I saw that man in the bank on May twenty-third. I saw him pull out a gun from his coat. I heard him demand that all of the money be given to him. I saw him as he left the bank. I saw him as the officer apprehended him outside." And if you can get three or four witnesses to point to that man and will keep their testimony under cross-examination, that man is judged to be guilty. He is the one who did it. We have two or three witnesses that are testifying the same story about that man, and it is accepted as fact that he is the one who perpetrated the crime and is guilty. You've got witnesses who have sworn to tell the truth that are verifying.<br/>After the death of Jesus, when He rose again, He appeared unto many different people who gave sworn testimony that they saw Him. That they talked to Him, that He appeared to them in various places under different circumstances. And for a period of forty days was visiting with them. And at one time, up to as many as five hundred people who were gathered at one place, He appeared. It's difficult to just cast aside or deny the witness of these people. To do so is to discredit our whole jurisprudence system. But not only that, these men who testified that they saw the risen Lord, that they talked to Him, that they ate with Him, they, all of them, with the exception of one, met violent deaths at the hands of other people because of their affirming that the story they told was true. You talk about witnesses sworn to tell the truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth. If a person's life was threatened because of that witness, and it was a lie, at least one them would've broken under the pressure. They would've confessed to the entire hoax. "He showed Himself alive after His passion by many infallible proofs."<br/>being seen of them for forty days, speaking to them of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God ( Act 1:3 ):<br/>Sometimes we fault the disciples because of their questions of the timing of the kingdom of God. Let it be remembered that the kingdom of God was the favorite subject of Jesus Christ. He was always talking about the kingdom of God, and it is a great hope that He was planting into the hearts of all men. Things are not always going to continue corrupted as they are. The world is not going to go forever under the power of darkness, under the bondage of evil. God is going to one day establish His kingdom upon the earth. A kingdom of righteous joy and peace. "Jesus shall reign, where ere the sun doth her successive journeys run. And His kingdom will extend from shore to shore." And that day will be the most glorious day the world has ever seen, as sickness and suffering and pain will be abolished in His kingdom. As sin and greed and these things that have made the world such an intolerable place will be abolished in His kingdom. The godless commercialism, the exploitation of man, all of these things abolished in His glorious kingdom when He reigns. No wonder the disciples were anxious to get it on. I'm anxious to get it on; I'm anxious for His kingdom to come. And Jesus told us when we pray, the first petition is, "Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven" ( Mat 6:10 ). This is the right kind of a desire that we should all have. I desire the kingdom of God. And so He was talking to them, during this forty-day period, of the kingdom.<br/>And, being assembled together with them, he commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which, saith he, you have heard of me ( Act 1:4 ).<br/>He said, "Now look, wait here in Jerusalem until you receive the promise of the Father." This promise that He is referring to is, no doubt, the promise in Joel where the Lord promised, "And it shall come to pass in the later days, saith the Lord, that I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and daughters will prophesy, and your young men shall dream dreams, your old men shall see visions: and upon my servants and my handmaidens shall I pour out my Spirit, saith the Lord" ( Joe 2:28-29 ). The promise of the Father: the day is going to come when God is going to pour out His Spirit upon all flesh, all of the believers. They will, each one, receive that dynamic from God.<br/>For John [He said,] truly baptized with water; but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now ( Act 1:5 ).<br/>The idea of baptism was that of emersion, the bapteedzo. John baptized with water, submerged the people in water, "you're going to be submerged in the Holy Spirit in not many days."<br/>Now when they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, will you at this time restore the kingdom to Israel? ( Act 1:6 )<br/>"When is it going to be, Lord? When's the time for this restoration?" And Jesus is talking to them now, not about the kingdom, but about the power that they're going to receive for service. And so He brushes aside their question.<br/>Saying unto them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father has put in his own power ( Act 1:7 ).<br/>"It's not for you to know." They lived constantly in the anticipation of the immediate setting up of the kingdom. During the entire lifetime of Jesus, they were expecting Him at any moment to go into the phone booth and come out as the savior of the world. Shazzam! Showing His power and overthrowing the governments of the world, establishing God's kingdom upon the earth. And they were waiting daily for this change to transpire. And whenever Jesus would talk about going to Jerusalem, being turned over into the hands of sinful man, and then being crucified, "Oh, oh no, Lord. No, no you don't understand the kingdom, Lord. Be that far from Thee." When Jesus died on the cross, they were all greatly disappointed.<br/>The two disciples on the road to Emmaus, so sad. "Hey, fellows. How come you're so sad as your walking along?" "What do you mean? You must be a stranger around here if you don't know the things that have been happening lately in Jerusalem." "What things?" "Oh, a fellow by the name of Jesus of Nazareth...oh man, it was mighty and powerful. The anointing of God was upon His life. We had hoped that in Him was the deliverance of Israel, but they crucified Him. We had hoped . . . now it's dead." Now He's risen, and He's saying, "In a few days, fellows, you're going to receive the promise of the Father." "Oh, what promise? The promise of the establishing of the kingdom?" You see, it was legitimate that they should ask. "Is this it Lord? Alright! Is this the time? Are you going to set up your kingdom now?" "No. It's not for you to know those times that the Father's appointed or that the Father has in His own power. But, you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you."<br/>Now here, the Greek preposition epi is used to signify a new relationship that they were to have with the Holy Spirit. In the Gospel According to John, chapter 14, as Jesus is there promising to send the Holy Spirit, He said, "I will not leave you comfortless. I will come to you, and I will pray the Father, and He will send to you another comforter, even the Spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth Him not neither knows Him, but you know Him for He dwells with you, and He shall be in you" ( Joh 14:17-18 ). Same Greek preposition as ours, only they spell it "en" instead of "in." Two-fold relationship there in John: He is with you, but He's going to be dwelling in you. But now Jesus said you're going to receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you. The Greek preposition epi, which is translated in different texts throughout the New Testament as "upon" or "over" or I like it, "overflows."<br/>In the seventh chapter of the gospel of John: "On the last day, the great day of the feast when Jesus stood there on the Temple Mount and cried to the people, 'If any man thirst let him come unto Me and drink: and he who drinks of the water that I give, out of his innermost being there will gush torrents of living water.'" John said, "This spake He of the Spirit, which was not yet given which they who believe on Him should receive" ( Joh 7:37-39 ). What did He speak of the Spirit? That it would be like a torrent of living water flowing out. I like, "When the Spirit overflows you," upon you, or over you, or overflows from you. So the three-fold relationship: He is with you prior to your conversion, He is the one who causes you to realize that you are a sinner, He is the one who points to Jesus Christ as the answer as He convinces the world of sin, of righteous, and of judgment. The moment you open your life and heart to Jesus Christ and invite Him to come in, the Holy Spirit comes and begins to indwell you. He shall be in you. "Know ye not that you are not your own, you have been bought with a price, therefore glorify God in your body and your spirit which are His. And know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit which is in you? Be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess, but be filled, or be ye being filled with the Spirit" ( 1Co 6:19-20 ,Eph 5:18 ). But now here's a third relationship. This is an empowering experience.<br/>You will receive [the dunamus] the dynamics, when the Holy Spirit has come [epi] upon you [or over you, or when there is that overflow from you]: and ye shall be witnesses unto me ( Act 1:8 )<br/>And so the dynamic, to be a witness for Jesus Christ. It is interesting that the word witness in Greek is the word martus from where we get our word martyr. And in Greek it does mean martyr. A witness is one who not only proclaims what he believes, he lives what he believes, he is what he believes, and he believes it so strongly, that if necessary, he'll die for what he believes. That's how strong is his belief. He's a martus. You can't stop him. He's not afraid to die for what he believes.<br/>You remember when Paul was on his way back to Jerusalem and Agabus came down from Caesarea and he took Paul's girdle and tied himself up and he said, "So is the man who owns this girdle to be bound when he gets to Jerusalem." And Paul's friends began to weep, saying, "Oh, Paul, don't go, don't go." And he said, "What do you mean by these tears? Do you think you're going to dissuade me? Do you think I'm worried about being bound? I'm ready to die." He was a martus. "I'm ready to die." Being put to death for your faith did not make you a martyr; because you were a martyr, you were put to death. Because you were a witness, because you believed it so strong. So, it did not make you a witness, it only proved what you were. You were a witness all along. If you hadn't been a martus, you would've never gone to your death. You would've recanted; you would've said, "Whoa, whoa, wait, wait. Hold on, let's change course here. I think that I may have made a mistake." Then you say, "Well, he wasn't a martus. Stealing a horse doesn't make you a horse thief; it only proves that you were. No one steals a horse unless he's a horse thief. So, stealing it doesn't make you a horse thief, it only proves that you were all along. Being martyred only proves what you were a witness, a martus. "And you will be witnesses." And isn't it interesting that most of them were martyred? "Witnesses unto Me."<br/>The witness was to be both in Jerusalem, and in all of Judea ( Act 1:8 ),<br/>The witness began right at home. The hardest place, isn't it? It's to start right at home in Jerusalem, and then the area around Jerusalem, the area of Judea. And then it was to spread up into Samaria. And then it was to go out into the uttermost parts of the world. And as we study the book of Acts, we will see this very progression. How the witness began in Jerusalem. We'll get that in the next chapter. And then we'll see how it began to spread through out Judea. And then Phillip went up into Samaria, and then finally Paul and Barnabas are called to go into the uttermost parts of the world. And so the witness spread through the anointing and the empowering of the Holy Spirit.<br/>Now when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight ( Act 1:9 ).<br/>This is the final promise made by Jesus to His disciples. This is it, the final words prior to His ascension. Of course, later He came and talked to Paul and others, but prior to His ascension, this is His final word. And upon this, when He had spoken these things, while they were watching Him, He was taken up and a cloud received Him out of their sight.<br/>And while they were looking steadfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, there were two men who stood by them in white apparel ( Act 1:10 );<br/>We assume they were angels.<br/>Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as you have seen him go into heaven ( Act 1:11 ).<br/>They saw Him as He ascended up into heaven and they will behold Him when He comes again. "Behold the Lord cometh with ten thousands of His saints, to execute judgement upon the earth" (Jud 1:14-15). And then, "Unto Him who loved us and gave Himself for us and who has made us unto our God, kings and priests who shall reign with Him upon the earth, behold the Lord cometh, and every eye shall see Him, and they also who pierced Him shall mourn" Rev 1:5-7 ). So the Lord's coming. Every eye shall see Him. The Jehovah Witnesses say that He is already come, but it was a secret coming. As it was only the disciples that saw Him go, it was only the disciples, of the Jehovah Witnesses, who saw Him return. But Jesus said, "If they say unto you, 'He has come in secret and has gone into a secret chamber don't believe it'" ( Mat 24:26 ). So you have to choose, to believe Jesus or them.<br/>"This same Jesus which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as you've seen Him go into heaven."<br/>Now there's a very interesting verse in II John, verse Act 1:7 , "For many deceivers are entered into the world who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh." That, unfortunately, is a poor translation of the Greek. For this participle is in the present tense and should be translated "is coming in the flesh." Those who would deny that Jesus Christ is coming in the flesh. What does John say of them? "They are a deceiver and an antichrist. Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward. For whosoever transgresses and abides not in the doctrine of Christ, has not God. He that abides in the doctrine of Christ, he has both the Father and the Son. And if there come any unto your door (on Saturday morning) and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, and neither bid him good-bye. For he that bids him good-bye is a partaker of his evil deeds" (2Jn 1:7-11). Ask them one question, "Is Jesus coming in the flesh?" Just ask them that question. And if they say no, just remember what John warned you and what John told you. "If any confess not that Jesus Christ is coming in the flesh." Do you remember when He was with the disciples and He said, "Give me something to eat"? He said, "You know, spirits don't eat; touch me. See? It's me." So, this same Jesus is coming again in the same manner in which they saw Him go into heaven. And I, for one, believe that that coming is very soon.<br/>Then retuned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a Sabbath's day journey [about two-thirds of a mile]. And when they were come in, they went up into an upper room, where there abode both Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, and Phillip, and Thomas, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon Zelotes, and Judas the brother of James. And these all continued in one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers ( Act 1:12-14 ).<br/>This is the last mention of Mary the mother of Jesus. At this point and from this point on, there is no further mention of her in the Acts of the Apostles or in the epistles. No mention of her death or of her miraculous ascension into heaven, without death. Nothing is mentioned in the scripture. It is silent.<br/>His brethren would be a reference probably to James and to Jude and to those other brothers who were sons of Joseph and Mary.<br/>The upper room--there are some who say that it is the same upper room in which Jesus had the Last Supper with His disciples. And yet, there are others who hold to this upper room being a room in the temple precincts where the early church met. Take your choice.<br/>And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples, and said, (the number of their names together were about one hundred and twenty,) men and brethren, this Scripture must needs have been fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit by the mouth of David spake before concerning Judas, which was a guide to those who took Jesus ( Act 1:15-16 ).<br/>Here again, Peter still his same impetuous self. They're waiting in prayer and supplication, and Peter stands up and says, "Fellows, there's a scripture that's gotta be fulfilled." And you know he's going to move ahead, "Let's get the program going; let's cast lots and find out who's going to take Judas' place." I do feel that Peter was again in the flesh, manifesting that impetuous nature that was his. And I think that the future history of the church in the book of Acts points this out. I am interested in Peter's understanding of the scriptures, how that he is quoting from so many places in the Old Testament. Peter does manifest a very great understanding of the Old Testament scriptures which is a point in his favor.<br/>Notice that Peter ascribes to the Holy Spirit those things that David wrote. So that, "All scripture is given by inspiration of God" ( 2Ti 3:16 ). Not part of the scriptures. Because, if you tell me that part of the scriptures are given by inspiration of God, then I must ask you, "What parts are by inspiration and what parts are not by inspiration?" And then you are then the authority who tells me what part I can believe and what part I can't believe. And the minute that God is no longer the authority but you're the authority, I'm in trouble. Beware of those who say, "Well, you can't believe all of the scriptures." The scriptures themselves say, "All scripture is given by inspiration of God." And here, Luke in writing of what Peter was saying, declares that David was actually the spokesman for the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit, by the mouth of David, spake concerning Judas.<br/>For he was numbered with us, [he was one of the twelve] he had obtained a part of this ministry. But now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity; and falling headlong ( Act 1:17-18 ),<br/>He purchased the field, the potter's field as Zachariah the eleventh chapter declares.<br/>and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all of his bowels gushed out ( Act 1:18 ).<br/>There are those who find a discrepancy in the scriptures, because in one of the gospels we are told that when Judas came back and tried to return the money, and they said, "Hey, it's your problem. We can't take it." And put it back in the temple treasury. "It's blood money." Then he threw it there on the floor of the temple and he went out and hung himself. Here Peter tells us that he fell headlong and just popped. And there are those who imagine a discrepancy. Very simple, he went up into the tree to hang himself, tied the rope around his neck and tied it to the limb and jumped. And the force of the fall either snapped the rope or his head, and he fell on down into the canyon and just as he said it here.<br/>It was known to all of the dwellers at Jerusalem; insomuch that the field is called in their tongue, Aceldama, that is to say, The field of blood. For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be desolate, and let no man dwell therein: and, His bishoprick let another take ( Act 1:19-20 ).<br/>Now in reality he's quoting from two different Psalms here. From Psa 69:25 ,he puts it together with Psa 109:8 . And putting the two together he finds these prophecies concerning Judas.<br/>Wherefore of these men ( Act 1:21 )<br/>Now here is where they are looking for someone to take Judas' place to be an apostle. Here are the qualifications they looked for in that time.<br/>Wherefore of these men which have companied with us all the time that the Lord Jesus when in and out among us ( Act 1:21 ),<br/>Now you remember there were many disciples, many disciples of which Jesus chose ten to be apostles. And the word apostle means "one who is sent out." Or chose twelve to be apostles, so He sent out the twelve. The number of human government. "We only have eleven. We need one to take Judas' place, but we need one who has been with us all the while from the beginning with Jesus."<br/>From the time he was baptized by John, until the day he was taken up from us, must one be ordained to be a witness [of what?] of His resurrection ( Act 1:22 ).<br/>So these were the requirements they were looking for. Someone who had been around the whole while. From the time of John's baptism to the ascension. And one who saw the risen Lord, and thus could bear fact of the resurrection, their testimony to the fact.<br/>Now Paul the apostle, later in asserting the fact that he was an apostle said, "Have I not seen the risen Christ?" Evidently that was one of the requirements of apostleship. Someone asked me, "Are there apostles today?" Well, I don't know. I don't think that there are in the same sense that they were in the New Testament. Surely there is none today who can bear witness to the resurrection as they did.<br/>They appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias. And they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord, which knowest the hearts of all men, show whether of these two that you have chosen ( Act 1:23-24 ),<br/>I think that we often make this mistake of giving the Lord two choices, both wrong. Limiting God, you see. We're so prone to do this. Obviously, Paul was God's choice. Peter was impetuous, and jumping the gun said, "Hey, we've got to do something, you know, gotta help God out. You know, one's missing and we've got to fill him in." And yet, "God, which one of these two do you want?" And giving God the two choices.<br/>That he may take part of this ministry and this apostleship, from which Judas by the transgression fell, that he might go to his own place. And so they gave forth their lots ( Act 1:25-26 );<br/>An interesting way by which they sought to determine the will of God. Let's throw dice, find out what God's will is here. It's interesting to me, the various ways that people have devised to discern the will of God. Now, in the Old Testament times they had an interesting way of coming to the priest, who would inquire of the Lord for them through the Urim and the Thummim, the "lights and perfections." Just what these Urim and Thummim were, we don't know. I'm sure they were not the colored glasses that Joseph Smith found with the Golden Tablets; the magic glasses, that when you put them on, you could suddenly read the hieroglyphic writing.<br/>There are those who say that the Urim and Thummim were actually a black and a white stone that was worn in a pouch on the chest of the priest. They would pray and ask the Lord a particular question. You remember that David was asking the Lord definite questions: "Lord, shall we go out against the Philistines?" The answer was, "No." So again, the next day, "Lord, shall we go out against the Philistines?" The answer was, "Yes." "When shall we go?" They would ask specific questions, and the Lord would direct them through the Urim and the Thummin. They say that the priest would pray, seek God, and then reach in and pull out one of the two stones. If it was the white stone, it was a yes answer. If it was a no, then it would be the black stone that he would pull out. Some even say we get the term blackballed from this Urim and Thummim. Actually, back in the original it is a no vote against a particular project or idea. Just what the Urim and Thummim were, we don't know. But during the Old Testament period, they did use a method of casting lots to determine the will of God.<br/>So here the disciples are picking up on the same thing as they are throwing the dice to see which of the two fellows that God had chosen to replace Judas Iscariot.<br/>the lot fell on Matthias; he was numbered with the eleven ( Act 1:26 ).<br/>Now who in the world is Matthias? No one ever heard of him before or since. It'll be interesting to meet Matthias and find out who he is and what he did. I think from the subsequent history, it's obvious to assume that God chose Paul as an apostle. Paul declares it himself. Now this is the last time we ever read of them seeking to discern the will of God by the casting of lots or by a chance kind of a thing.<br/>I know a fellow today, in seeking to discern the will of the Lord, will pray and ask the Lord a question. He'll have ten pennies in his pocket, and as he's praying, he'll take the pennies with his eyes closed and put them down on the table, and if they all come up heads, it's a yes. An interesting thing, every once in a while, they'll all come up heads, and that's pretty good odds. Yet, we don't find any pattern for this after the Holy Spirit was given. Once the Holy Spirit came upon the church, then the Holy Spirit began to speak to them and direct them. And the Holy Spirit said, "Separate unto me Paul and Barnabas for the ministry where I have called them" ( Act 13:2 ). And the Holy Spirit sent them forth. So we find the church more directly guided by the Holy Spirit. Once the Holy Spirit came, this throwing dice to find out the will of God was set aside.<br/>"<br/><br/>King James Version<br/><br/>This is the 1769 King James Version of the Holy Bible (also known as the Authorized Version). "Public Domain" | Smith Chuck - Prostredníctvom Biblie C2000 SeriesSmieme sa obrátiť na knihu Skutkov, kapitola jedna, ako začneme naše štúdium ranej cirkvi.<br/>Lukáš, autor knihy Skutkov, spoločník Pavla apoštola, ktorý bol tiež autorom evanjelia Podľa Lukáša, napísal tieto dve pojednania priateľovi, Theophilus. Theophilus je grécke meno. Je to meno, ktoré má krásny význam. Meno znamená milovníka Boha. Niektorí veria, že to vôbec nebol človek, ale že evanjelium a kniha Skutkov boli adresované milovníkom Boha, nech ste ktokoľvek. Existujú aj iné tradície, ktoré hovoria, že Theophilus bol v skutočnosti Lukeov pán. Že v tých dňoch lekári boli otroci, zvyčajne otrok bohatého patróna. Takže Lukášov pán bol Theophilus, a prepustil Lukáša, aby bol s Pavlom na misijných cestách. Toto je raná tradícia cirkvi, ale je to samozrejme nemožné dokázať, rovnako ako mnoho tradícií.<br/>Sú aj takí, ktorí veria, že keď bol Pavol v Troade a dostal videnie muža, ktorý ho volal: "Poď do Macedónie a pomôž nám," že ten muž v Pavlovom videní nebol nikto iný ako Lukáš. Prvý, s ktorým sa Pavol skutočne stretol, keď prišiel do Macedónska, bol Lukáš. A ako sme v knihe Skutkov, zistíte, že keď sa dostaneme k tej časti knihy Skutkov, Lukáš začne písať viac v prvej osobe než v tretej osobe. Takže je zrejmé, že v tomto konkrétnom bode v Skutkoch apoštolov sa Lukáš stal Pavlovým spoločníkom a začal s ním cestovať. Začal používať zámená "my" a "my" namiesto "oni" a "oni". Toto je nepochybne miesto, kde sa Luke stal účastníkom a očitým svedkom tých vecí, ktoré sa diali od tohto bodu.<br/>Začne Skutky apoštolov tým, že ju viaže s evanjeliom podľa Lukáša. Je zaujímavé, že úplne posledná vec, ktorú Lukáš zaznamenáva vo svojom evanjeliu, je prvá vec, ktorú zaznamenáva v Skutkoch apoštolov. Zisťujeme, že evanjelium Lukáša sa zatvára, keď Ježiš hovorí svojim učeníkom, aby čakali v Jeruzaleme, kým nebudú obdarení mocou zhora. A potom Ježiš vystúpil do neba, a tak zatvára evanjelium. Pri otváraní Skutkov apoštolov píše,<br/>Prvé pojednanie [to jest evanjelium podľa Lukáša] som ti napísal, Teofilos, o všetkom, čo Ježiš začal robiť a učiť (Skutky 1:1),<br/>Kľúčové slovo sa začína. Evanjelium podľa Lukáša nie je úplným príbehom služby Ježiša Krista. Je to len začiatok služby Ježiša Krista. Ježiš naďalej slúži potrebám ľudí. Ježiš naďalej uzdravuje chorých. Ježiš naďalej kriesi mŕtvych. Ježiš naďalej slúži Svojej láske a Svojmu evanjeliu svetu, až teraz slúži prostredníctvom tých učeníkov, ktorí boli pomazaní Jeho Duchom Svätým. Ale Kristova služba pokračuje; v podstate, je predpoklad, že Lukáš prijíma v Skutkoch apoštolov. Prvé pojednanie o všetkom, čo Ježiš začal, ako robiť a učiť.<br/>Preto sú Skutky apoštolov nedokončenou knihou, v ktorej Pán pokračuje v práci životom tých, ktorí sa oddali tomu, aby sa stali Božími nástrojmi. Byť vedený a vedený a pomazaný Jeho Duchom Svätým, pokračovať v Ježišovej službe v dnešnom svete. Teraz Boh ustanovil, že Jeho dielo by malo byť vykonané prostredníctvom ľudských nástrojov. Nehovorím, že musí byť dokončené. Boh môže použiť anjelské bytosti pre svoje dielo a v priebehu knihy Zjavenia príde čas, keď Boh použije anjelov na ohlasovanie svojho evanjelia ľuďom na celom svete. Zjavenie, kapitola 14, "Prvý anjel letiaci stredom neba s večným evanjeliom" (Zjv 14:6). Ale v súčasnej dobe sa Boh rozhodol použiť ľudské nástroje. Tak nedokonalé, ako môžu byť, ale to je to, čo Boh nariadil použiť. Vzrušujúca vec na tom je, že Boh použije mňa a Boh použije vás. Toľkokrát sme prosiť off, "O Pane, nemôžem hovoriť. Nikdy som bol schopný hovoriť pred, alebo dokonca teraz, Pane." Ako Mojžiš sa snažil prosiť volanie Boha. Jeremiah povedal: "Pane, som len dieťa, nikto ma nebude počúvať." A všetci máme svoje výhovorky, prečo nás nemôžu použiť. Nie? Všetci poznáme dôvody, prečo nás Boh nemohol použiť.<br/>Raz, keď Pán volal proroka, aby konal Jeho dielo, povedal: "Pane, pošli koho chceš." Pán povedal: "Hej, povolal som ťa." "Pane, dobrý nápad, pošli koho chceš." Tak často sme v tejto pozícii, "Pane, pošli rukou koho chceš, kohokoľvek okrem mňa Pane." A napriek tomu, Boh nariadil, aby nás použiť.<br/>Teraz každý z nás môže ukázať svoje vlastné nedokonalosti. Každý z nás môže poukázať na svoje vlastné neschopnosti, a každý z nás môže nájsť výhovorku, prečo by Boh nechcel použiť mňa. Ale napriek tomu, Boh sa rozhodol použiť vás. Aby sa cez tvoj život mohol zjaviť svetu v núdzi. Čuduješ sa, keď Boh má také nástroje, aby použil, ako vôbec túto prácu vykonal, však?<br/>Až do dňa, keď bol vzatý hore, potom dal skrze Ducha Svätého prikázania apoštolom, ktorých si vyvolil (Skutky 1:2):<br/>To je to, s čím skončil Lukášovo evanjelium. V deň, keď bol Ježiš vzatý hore, potom, čo povedal apoštolom, aby čakali na udelenie moci.<br/>On sa im ukázal živý aj po svojom umučení (alebo smrti) mnohými neomylnými dôkazmi (Skutky 1:3).<br/>Je ťažké poprieť skutočnosť vzkriesenia Ježiša Krista. Bol som pobavený, rovnako ako naštvaný a podráždený článkom, ktorý som čítal v registri Santa Ana minulú sobotu. Ako to, že jeden profesor povedal, že vyučuje vedu, a tak sa zaoberajú iba faktami, a že nemajú miesto pre teórie. Pretože veda je založená na faktoch a stvorenie je založené na náboženských poverách. Veriť náboženským teóriám vyžaduje veľa viery. Keď sa zaoberáte faktami, môžete ich jednoducho prijať. Pomyslel som si, "Veľmi zaujímavé v tejto vedeckej triede, naučili ma, že to bol fakt, že svet bol starý štyri miliardy rokov. Nie je to tak dávno, čo som chodila do školy."<br/>Je zaujímavé, že Biblia nikdy nemusela byť revidovaná alebo aktualizovaná, aby vyhovovala súčasným údajom, ktoré ľudia objavili. A napriek tomu, ak by ste dnes vzali moje stredoškolské prírodovedné učebnice a pokúsili sa z nich vyučovať vedu, zistili by ste, že mnohé z vecí, ktoré sa učili ako vedecký fakt, keď som bol na strednej škole, už nie sú uznávané ako vedecký fakt. Jednoduchá bunková protoplazma už nie je jednoduchá bunka, ale mimoriadne zložitá. Ak existuje nejaký fakt, ktorý sa dá dosvedčiť v histórii, je to skutočnosť vzkriesenia Ježiša Krista z mŕtvych.<br/>Máme právny systém, ktorý je založený na svedectvách svedkov. Ak je človek obvinený zo zločinu a sú ľudia, ktorí boli svedkami tohto zločinu, zatiaľ čo bol spáchaný, a oni sú privedení k štandardu, a prisahajú, že budú hovoriť pravdu, celú pravdu a nič iné ako pravdu, tak im pomáhaj Boh. A v ich výsluchu potvrdzujú, že: "Videl som toho muža v banke dvadsiateho tretieho mája. Videl som ho vytiahnuť zbraň z kabáta. Počul som ho požadovať, aby mu boli všetky peniaze poskytnuté. Videl som ho, keď opustil banku. Videl som ho, ako ho strážnik vonku zadržal.“ A ak sa vám podarí získať troch alebo štyroch svedkov, aby ukázali na toho muža, a ich svedectvo bude pod krížovým výsluchom, ten človek je súdený za vinného. On je ten, kto to urobil. Máme dvoch alebo troch svedkov, ktorí svedčia o tom istom príbehu o tom mužovi, a je akceptované, že on je ten, kto spáchal zločin a je vinný.<br/>Po Ježišovej smrti, keď vstal z mŕtvych, zjavil sa mnohým ľuďom, ktorí prisahali, že ho videli. Že s ním hovorili, že sa im zjavil na rôznych miestach za rôznych okolností. A po dobu štyridsiatich dní bol na návšteve s nimi. A naraz, až päťsto ľudí, ktorí sa zhromaždili na jednom mieste, On sa zjavil. Je ťažké jednoducho odložiť stranou alebo poprieť svedectvo týchto ľudí. To znamená zdiskreditovať celý náš právny systém. Ale nielen to, títo muži, ktorí svedčili, že videli zmŕtvychvstalého Pána, že sa s ním rozprávali, že s ním jedli, všetci, s výnimkou jedného, narazili na násilnú smrť z rúk iných ľudí, pretože tvrdili, že príbeh, ktorý povedali, je pravdivý. Hovoríte o svedkoch, ktorí prisahali, že budú hovoriť pravdu, celú pravdu, nič iné len pravdu. Priznali by sa k celému podvodu. "Ukázal sa živý po svojej vášni mnohými neomylnými dôkazmi."<br/>Keď ich videli štyridsať dní a hovorili im o tom, čo sa týka Božieho kráľovstva (Sk 1, 3):<br/>Niekedy sme vinu učeníkov, pretože ich otázky načasovanie Božieho kráľovstva. Nech sa pripomína, že Božie kráľovstvo bolo obľúbeným predmetom Ježiša Krista. Vždy hovoril o kráľovstve Božom, a to je veľká nádej, že On bol výsadba do sŕdc všetkých ľudí. Veci nie sú vždy bude pokračovať poškodený ako oni sú. Svet nepôjde navždy pod mocou temnoty, pod otroctvom zla. Boh jedného dňa zriadi svoje kráľovstvo na zemi. Kráľovstvo spravodlivej radosti a pokoja. "Ježiš bude kraľovať, kde pred slnkom bežia jeho následné cesty. A jeho kráľovstvo sa rozšíri od brehu k brehu." A ten deň bude najslávnejší deň, aký kedy svet videl, pretože v Jeho kráľovstve budú odstránené choroby a utrpenie a bolesť. Ako hriech a chamtivosť a tieto veci, ktoré urobili svet takým neznesiteľným miestom, budú zrušené v Jeho kráľovstve. Bezbožný komercionalizmus, vykorisťovanie človeka, všetky tieto veci boli zrušené v Jeho slávnom kráľovstve, keď On vládne. Niet divu, že učeníci boli dychtiví dostať sa na to. Som dychtivý dostať sa na to; Som nervózny o Jeho kráľovstvo príde. A Ježiš nám povedal, keď sa modlíme, prvá prosba je: "Príď kráľovstvo tvoje. Buď vôľa tvoja ako v nebi, tak i na zemi" (Mt 6:10). To je tá správna túžba, ktorú by sme mali mať všetci. Túžim po kráľovstve Božom. A tak k nim počas tohto štyridsaťdňového obdobia hovoril o kráľovstve.<br/>A keď sa s nimi zhromaždil, prikázal im, aby neodchádzali z Jeruzalema, ale aby očakávali Otcovo zasľúbenie, ktoré ste počuli odo mňa.<br/>A on povedal: Hľaďte, tu v Jeruzaleme zostaňte, dokiaľ neprijmete zasľúbenie Otcovo. Toto zasľúbenie, o ktorom hovorí, je bezpochyby zasľúbenie v Joel, kde Pán sľúbil: "A stane sa v neskorších dňoch, hovorí Pán, že vylejem svojho Ducha na každé telo; a vaši synovia a dcéry budú prorokovať, a vaši mladíci budú snívať sny, vaši starci uvidia videnia; a na mojich služobníkov a na mojich služobníkov vylejem svojho Ducha, hovorí Pán." Prisľúbenie Otca: príde deň, keď Boh vyleje svojho Ducha na každé telo, všetkých veriacich. Každý z nich dostane túto dynamiku od Boha.<br/>Lebo Ján [povedal] skutočne pokrstený vodou, ale vy budete pokrstení Duchom Svätým o nemnoho dní“ (Skutky 1:5).<br/>Myšlienka krstu bola, že emersion, bapteedzo. Ján pokrstil vodou, ponoril ľudí do vody, "budete ponorení v Duchu Svätom v nie veľa dní."<br/>Keď sa teda zišli, pýtali sa ho: "Pane, obnovíš v tomto čase kráľovstvo Izraelu?"<br/>"Kedy to bude, Pane? Kedy je čas na túto obnovu?" A Ježiš k nim teraz hovorí, nie o kráľovstve, ale o sile, ktorú dostanú za službu. A tak odkladá ich otázku.<br/>Hovoriac im: Nie je na vás, aby ste poznali časy alebo obdobia, ktoré Otec zveril do svojej moci (Skutky 1:7).<br/>"To nie je pre vás vedieť." Žili neustále v očakávaní okamžitého zriadenia kráľovstva. Počas celého života Ježiša, oni očakávali Ho v každom okamihu ísť do telefónnej búdky a vyjsť ako záchranca sveta. Shazzam! Ukázať svoju moc a zvrhnutie vlády sveta, zriadenie Božieho kráľovstva na zemi. A oni čakali každý deň na túto zmenu, aby sa stalo. A vždy, keď Ježiš hovoril o tom, že pôjde do Jeruzalema, že bude prevedený do rúk hriešneho človeka, a potom bude ukrižovaný, "Ach, nie, Pane. Nie, ty nerozumieš kráľovstvu, Pane. Buď tak ďaleko od Teba." Keď Ježiš zomrel na kríži, všetci boli veľmi sklamaní.<br/>Dvaja učeníci na ceste do Emauz, tak smutní. "Hej, chlapci. Ako to, že ste tak smutní, ako vaša chôdza?" "Čo tým myslíte? Musíte byť cudzincom tu, ak neviete, čo sa v poslednej dobe deje v Jeruzaleme." "Aké veci?" "Ach, chlapík menom Ježiš Nazaretský ... ó človeče, bolo to mocné a mocné. Božie pomazanie bolo na jeho živote. Dúfali sme, že v ňom je vyslobodenie Izraela, ale ukrižovali ho. Dúfali sme... teraz je mŕtvy." Teraz vstal a hovorí: "O niekoľko dní, priatelia, dostanete Otcov sľub." "Aký sľub? Sľub založenia kráľovstva?" Vidíte, bolo legitímne, aby sa pýtali. "Je to Pán? Dobre! Je toto čas? Chystáte sa teraz založiť svoje kráľovstvo? "Nie. Nie je pre vás poznať tie časy, ktoré Otec určil alebo že Otec má vo svojej vlastnej moci. Ale dostanete moc, keď na vás zostúpi Duch Svätý."<br/>Teraz tu, grécka predložka epi sa používa na označenie nového vzťahu, ktoré mali mať s Duchom Svätým. V Evanjeliu podľa Jána, kapitola 14, keď Ježiš sľubuje, že pošle Ducha Svätého, povedal: "Nenechám vás bez útechy. Ja prídem k vám a budem sa modliť k Otcovi a on vám pošle iného utešiteľa, Ducha pravdy, ktorého svet nemôže prijať, lebo ho vidí a nepozná, ale vy ho poznáte, lebo prebýva s vami a bude vo vás“ (Jn 14,17-18). Rovnaká grécka predložka ako naša, len to píšu "en" namiesto "v". Dvojaký vzťah tam v Jánovi: On je s vami, ale On bude prebývať vo vás. Ale teraz Ježiš povedal, že dostanete moc, keď na vás príde Duch Svätý. Grécke predložky epi, ktorý je preložený v rôznych textoch v celom Novom zákone ako "na" alebo "nad" alebo sa mi to páči, "preteky."<br/>V siedmej kapitole Jánovho evanjelia sa píše: "V posledný deň, veľký deň sviatku, keď tam Ježiš stál na chrámovej hore a volal k ľudu: "Ak niekto smädný nech príde ku mne a pije, a kto pije z vody, ktorú ja dávam, z jeho vnútra vytrysknú prúdy živej vody." Ján povedal: "Toto hovoril o Duchu, ktorý ešte nebol daný, aby ho prijali tí, ktorí v neho veria" (Jn 7,37-39). Čo hovoril o Duchu? Že to bude ako prúd živej vody, ktorá vyteká. Páči sa mi, "Keď duch pretečie vás," na vás, alebo nad vami, alebo pretečie od vás. Takže trojnásobný vzťah: On je s vami pred vaším obrátením, On je ten, ktorý vám dáva uvedomiť si, že ste hriešnik, On je ten, ktorý poukazuje na Ježiša Krista ako na odpoveď, keď presviedča svet o hriechu, spravodlivosti a súde. V okamihu, keď otvoríte svoj život a srdce Ježišovi Kristovi a pozvete ho, aby vošiel, príde Duch Svätý a začne vás prebývať. On bude vo vás. "Neviete, že nie ste sami sebou, boli ste kúpení za cenu, preto oslavujte Boha vo svojom tele a svojho ducha, ktorý je jeho. A neviete, že vaše telo je chrámom Ducha Svätého, ktorý je vo vás? Nepite vínom, v ktorom je prebytok, ale buďte naplnení, alebo buďte naplnení Duchom" (1Kor 6, 19-20, Ef 5, 18). Ale teraz je tu tretí vzťah. To je posilňujúca skúsenosť.<br/>Prijmete [dunamus] dynamika, keď Duch Svätý zostúpil [epi] na vás [alebo nad vami, alebo keď je to, že vytečie z vás], a budete mi svedkami (Skutky 1: 8 )<br/>A tak dynamika, byť svedkom pre Ježiša Krista. Je zaujímavé, že slovo svedok v gréčtine je slovo martus, odkiaľ dostaneme naše slovo mučeník. A v gréčtine to znamená mučeník. Svedok je ten, kto nielenže vyhlasuje to, v čo verí, žije to, v čo verí, je tým, v čo verí, a verí tomu tak silno, že ak to bude potrebné, zomrie za to, v čo verí. Nemôžeš ho zastaviť, nebojí sa zomrieť za to, čomu verí.<br/>Pamätáte si, keď bol Pavol na ceste späť do Jeruzalema a Agabus zostúpil z Cézarey a vzal Pavlov opasok a zviazal sa a povedal: "Taký je človek, ktorý vlastní tento opasok, aby bol zviazaný, keď sa dostane do Jeruzalema." A Paulovi priatelia začali plakať a hovorili: "Ach, Paul, nechoď, nechoď." A on povedal: "Čo myslíš tými slzami? Myslíš si, že ma odradíš? Myslíš si, že sa bojím, že budem zviazaný? Som pripravený zomrieť." Bol to martus. "Som pripravený zomrieť." Byť usmrtený pre svoju vieru z teba neurobil mučeníka; pretože si bol mučeníkom, bol si usmrtený. Pretože si bol svedkom, pretože si tomu veril tak silno. Takže to z teba neurobilo svedka, len to dokázalo, čo si bol. Bol si svedkom po celý čas. Keby si nebol martus, nikdy by si nešiel na smrť. Odvolal by si to; povedal by si: "Whoa, whoa, počkaj, počkaj. Vydržte, zmeňme kurz. Myslím, že som možno urobil chybu." Potom poviete, "No, nebol to martus. Kradnutie koňa z vás nerobí zlodeja koní; to len dokazuje, že ste boli. Nikto neukradne koňa, ak nie je zlodej koní. Takže, kradnutie z vás nerobí zlodeja koní, to len dokazuje, že ste boli po celú dobu. Byť umučený dokazuje len to, čo ste boli svedkom, martus. "A budete svedkami." A nie je zaujímavé, že väčšina z nich bola umučená? "Svedkovia pre mňa."<br/>Svedok mal byť v Jeruzaleme i v celej Judei (Skutky 1:8).<br/>Svedok začal priamo doma. Najťažšie miesto, však? Je to začať priamo doma v Jeruzaleme, a potom oblasť okolo Jeruzalema, oblasť Judey. A potom sa to malo rozšíriť do Samárie. A potom to bolo ísť von do najvzdialenejších častí sveta. A keď budeme študovať knihu Skutkov, uvidíme tento vývoj. Ako svedok začal v Jeruzaleme. Dostaneme to v ďalšej kapitole. A potom uvidíme, ako sa to začalo šíriť po Judei, a potom Phillip vystúpil do Samárie, a nakoniec sú Pavol a Barnabáš povolaní, aby išli do najvzdialenejších končín sveta. A tak sa svedectvo rozšírilo pomazaním a posilnením Ducha Svätého.<br/>A keď to povedal, kým to videli, zdvihol sa a oblak im ho vzal z očí (Skutky 1:9).<br/>Toto je posledný sľub, ktorý dal Ježiš svojim učeníkom. Toto sú posledné slová pred Jeho nanebovstúpením. Samozrejme, neskôr prišiel a hovoril s Pavlom a inými, ale pred Jeho nanebovstúpením je to Jeho posledné slovo. A keď to povedal, zatiaľ čo ho pozorovali, zdvihol sa a oblak ho prijal z ich očí.<br/>A keď hľadeli pevne hore k nebu, hľa, stáli pri nich dvaja mužovia v bielom rúchu.<br/>Predpokladáme, že to boli anjeli.<br/>Ktorý tiež povedal: Muži Galilejskí, prečo stojíte a hľadíte do neba? Ten istý Ježiš, ktorý je vzatý od vás do neba, príde tak, ako ste ho videli ísť do neba.<br/>Videli ho, ako vystúpil do neba, a uvidia ho, keď sa vráti. "Hľa, Pán prichádza s desiatimi tisícmi svojich svätých, aby vykonal súd na zemi" (Júd 1, 14-15). A potom: "Tomu, ktorý nás miloval a dal seba samého za nás a ktorý nás učinil nášmu Bohu, kráľom a kňazom, ktorí budú s ním kraľovať na zemi, hľa, Pán prichádza, a každé oko ho uvidí, a aj tí, ktorí ho prebodli, budú smútiť" Zjv 1, 5-7). Tak prichádza Pán. Každé oko ho uvidí. Svedkovia Jehovovi hovoria, že už prišiel, ale bol to tajný príchod. Ako to bolo len učeníci, ktorí ho videli ísť, to boli len učeníci, z Jehovových svedkov, ktorí ho videli vrátiť. Ale Ježiš povedal: Ak vám povedia: »Prišiel potajomky a vošiel do tajnej miestnosti, neverte!«“ (Mt 24,26).<br/>Ten istý Ježiš, ktorý je vzatý od vás do neba, príde tak, ako ste ho videli ísť do neba.<br/>Teraz je tu veľmi zaujímavý verš v II Ján, verš Skutky 1: 7, "Pre mnoho podvodníkov sú vošli do sveta, ktorí vyznávajú, že Ježiš Kristus prišiel v tele." To, bohužiaľ, je zlý preklad gréckeho. Lebo tento príčastie je v prítomnom čase a mal by byť preložený "prichádza v tele." Tí, ktorí by poprieť, že Ježiš Kristus prichádza v tele. Čo hovorí Ján o nich? "Sú zvodca a antikrist. Hľaďte sami na seba, aby sme nestratili toho, čo sme učinili, ale aby sme dostali plnú odmenu. Lebo kto by prestúpil a nezostal v učení Kristovom, nemá Boha. Ten, kto ostáva v učení Kristovom, má Otca i Syna. A ak niekto príde k vašim dverám (v sobotu ráno) a neprinesie túto náuku, neprijímajte ho do svojho domu, a ani ho rozlúčiť. Lebo ten, kto sa s ním lúči, je účastníkom jeho zlých skutkov" (2Jn 1, 7-11). Opýtajte sa ich jednu otázku: "Prichádza Ježiš v tele?" Len sa ich opýtajte túto otázku. A ak hovoria nie, len si spomeňte, čo vás Ján varoval a čo vám povedal Ján. "Ak niekto nevyzná, že Ježiš Kristus prichádza v tele." Pamätáte si, keď bol s učeníkmi a povedal: "Dajte mi niečo na jedenie?" On povedal: "Viete, duchovia nejedia, dotýkajte sa ma. Vidíte? To som ja." Tak, ten istý Ježiš prichádza znova rovnakým spôsobom, ako ho videli ísť do neba. A ja, pre jedného, verím, že to príchod je veľmi skoro.<br/>Potom sa vrátili do Jeruzalema od vrchu zvaného Olivetská, ktorý je od Jeruzalema cestou sobotného dňa (okolo dvoch tretín míle). A keď vošli, išli hore do vrchnej siene, kde býval Peter, Jakub, Ján, Andrej, Filip, Tomáš, Bartolomej, Matúš, Jakub, syn Alfeov, Šimon Zélotes a Judáš, Jakubov brat. A všetci pokračovali v jednote v modlitbe a úpenlivej prosbe so ženami a s Máriou, matkou Ježišovou, a s jeho bratmi (Sk 1, 12-14).<br/>Toto je posledná zmienka o Márii, matke Ježiša. V tomto bode a od tohto bodu, nie je žiadna ďalšia zmienka o nej v Skutkoch apoštolov alebo v listoch. Žiadna zmienka o jej smrti alebo o jej zázračnom vystúpení do neba, bez smrti. V Písme nie je nič spomenuté.<br/>Jeho bratia sa pravdepodobne zmieňovali o Jakubovi a Júdovi a o tých ďalších bratoch, ktorí boli synmi Jozefa a Márie.<br/>Horná miestnosť - niektorí hovoria, že je to tá istá horná miestnosť, v ktorej mal Ježiš Poslednú večeru so svojimi učeníkmi. A napriek tomu sú tu iní, ktorí držia túto hornú miestnosť, ktorá je miestnosťou v chrámových priestoroch, kde sa stretávala raná cirkev. Vyber si.<br/>A v tých dňoch sa Peter postavil uprostred učeníkov a povedal: (počet ich mien spolu bolo asi sto dvadsať) mužov a bratov, toto Písmo sa muselo naplniť, čo Duch Svätý skrze ústa Dávidove hovoril o Judášovi, ktorý bol vodcom tých, ktorí vzali Ježiša (Skutky 1:15-16).<br/>Tu znova, Peter stále jeho zbrklé ja. Čakajú v modlitbe a úpenlivej prosbe, a Peter vstane a hovorí, "Fellows, tam je Písmo, ktoré musí byť splnené." A viete, že sa pohne vpred, "Poďme na program, vrhnime veľa a zistime, kto zaujme Judášovo miesto." Mám pocit, že Peter bol opäť v tele, prejavujúc tú prudkú povahu, ktorá bola jeho. A myslím si, že budúce dejiny cirkvi v knihe Skutkov apoštolov na to poukazujú. Zaujíma ma Petrovo chápanie Písiem, ako to, že cituje z toľkých miest Starého zákona. Peter prejavuje veľmi veľké porozumenie Písiem Starého zákona, čo je bod v jeho prospech.<br/>Všimnite si, že Peter pripisuje Duchu Svätému to, čo napísal Dávid. Takže, "Celé Písmo je dané z vnuknutia Boha" (2Tim 3:16). Nie je súčasťou písma. Pretože, ak mi poviete, že časť písiem je daná inšpiráciou od Boha, potom sa vás musím opýtať: "Ktoré časti sú inšpiráciou a ktoré nie sú inšpiráciou?" A potom ste autorita, ktorá mi hovorí, ktorej časti môžem veriť a ktorej časti nemôžem veriť. A v minúte, keď Boh už nie je autoritou, ale vy ste autoritou, mám problémy. Dávajte si pozor na tých, ktorí hovoria: "Nuž, nemôžete veriť všetkým písmam." Samotné písma hovoria: "Celé písmo je dané inšpiráciou od Boha." A tu Lukáš v písomnej forme o tom, čo Peter hovoril, vyhlasuje, že Dávid bol vlastne hovorca Ducha Svätého. Duch Svätý, ústami Dávida, hovoril o Judášovi.<br/>Lebo bol počítaný s nami, [bol jeden z dvanástich] získal časť tejto služby. Ale teraz tento človek kúpil pole za odmenu neprávosti; a padol na hlavu (Skutky 1:17-18),<br/>On kúpil pole, hrnčiarovo pole, ako hovorí Zachariáš v jedenástej kapitole.<br/>A padnúc, roztrhol sa doprostred, a všetky jeho vnútornosti vytryskli (Skutky 1:18).<br/>Tam sú tí, ktorí nájsť rozpor v písmach, pretože v jednom z evanjelií nám bolo povedané, že keď Judáš sa vrátil a snažil sa vrátiť peniaze, a oni povedali, "Hej, to je váš problém. Nemôžeme to vziať." A dať ju späť do chrámovej pokladnice. "Je to krvavé peniaze." Potom ho hodil na podlahu chrámu a vyšiel von a obesil sa. Tu nám Peter hovorí, že padol po hlave a len vyskočil. A tam sú tí, ktorí si predstavujú nezrovnalosť. Veľmi jednoduché, on išiel hore do stromu, aby sa obesil, zviazal lano okolo krku a zviazal ho na končatinu a skočil. A sila pádu buď zlomila lano alebo hlavu, a on spadol do kaňonu a rovnako ako to povedal tu.<br/>A bolo to známe všetkým obyvateľom Jeruzalema, tak že sa volá pole v ich jazyku, Aceldama, to jest pole krvi. Lebo je napísané v knihe Žalmov: Nech je jeho príbytok pustý a nech v ňom nikto nebýva; a jeho biskupstvo nech vezme iný.<br/>Teraz v skutočnosti cituje z dvoch rôznych žalmov tu. Z Žalmu 69:25, dáva to spolu s Žalmom 109:8 . A dáva tieto dva dohromady nájde tieto proroctvá týkajúce sa Judáša.<br/>Preto z týchto mužov (Skutky 1:21)<br/>Tu je miesto, kde hľadajú niekoho, kto by zaujal miesto Judáša, aby bol apoštolom. Tu sú kvalifikácie, ktoré hľadali v tom čase.<br/>A preto z tých mužov, ktorí sa s nami spriatelili po celý čas, keď bol Pán Ježiš medzi nami,<br/>Teraz si pamätáte, že tam bolo veľa učeníkov, mnoho učeníkov, z ktorých Ježiš vybral desať, aby boli apoštolmi. A slovo apoštol znamená "ten, ktorý je poslaný." Alebo si vybral dvanásť, aby boli apoštolmi, tak poslal dvanásť. Počet ľudskej vlády. "Máme len jedenásť. Potrebujeme jedného, aby zaujal miesto Judáša, ale potrebujeme toho, ktorý bol s nami od začiatku s Ježišom."<br/>Od chvíle, keď bol pokrstený Jánom, až do dňa, keď bol od nás vzatý, musí byť jeden ustanovený, aby bol svedkom jeho vzkriesenia (Skutky 1:22).<br/>Takže to boli požiadavky, ktoré hľadali. Niekto, kto bol po celú dobu. Od času Jánovho krstu až po nanebovstúpenie. A ten, kto videl vzkrieseného Pána, a tak mohol niesť skutočnosť vzkriesenia, ich svedectvo o tom.<br/>Teraz Pavol apoštol, neskôr v tvrdení, že bol apoštol povedal, "Nevidel som vzkrieseného Krista?" Zrejme to bola jedna z požiadaviek apoštolstva. Niekto sa ma spýtal, "Sú dnes apoštoli?" No, neviem. Nemyslím si, že sú v tom istom zmysle, že boli v Novom zákone. Určite nie je dnes nikto, kto by mohol svedčiť o vzkriesení ako oni.<br/>Ustanovili dvoch, Jozefa zvaného Barsabas, ktorý sa volal Justus, a Mateja. A modlili sa a hovorili: Ty, Pane, ktorý poznáš srdcia všetkých ľudí, ukáž, či si si z týchto dvoch vyvolil (Skutky 1:23-24),<br/>Myslím, že často robíme túto chybu, že dávame Pánovi dve možnosti, obe zlé. Obmedzujeme Boha, viete. Sme tak náchylní to urobiť. Očividne, Paul bol Božou voľbou. Peter bol impulzívny, a skočil do zbrane a povedal, "Hej, musíme niečo urobiť, vieš, musíme pomôcť Bohu. Vieš, jeden chýba a my ho musíme vyplniť." A napriek tomu, "Bože, ktorý z týchto dvoch chceš?" A dal Bohu dve možnosti.<br/>Aby sa mohol zúčastniť na tejto službe a na tomto apoštolstve, z ktorého Judáš podľa priestupku vypadol, aby mohol ísť na svoje miesto. A tak vydali svoje losy (Skutky 1:25-26);<br/>Zaujímavý spôsob, akým sa snažili určiť Božiu vôľu. Hoďme kocky, zistime, čo je tu Božia vôľa. Je to pre mňa zaujímavé, rôzne spôsoby, ktoré ľudia vymysleli na rozlíšenie Božej vôle. V starozákonných časoch mali zaujímavý spôsob, ako prísť ku kňazovi, ktorý sa ich pýtal na Pána cez Urim a Thumim, "svetla a dokonalosti." Čo to boli Urim a Thumim, nevieme. Som si istý, že to neboli farebné okuliare, ktoré Joseph Smith našiel pri Zlatých tabuľkách; magické okuliare, ktoré keď si ich oblečiete, môžete si zrazu prečítať hieroglyfické písmo.<br/>Tam sú tí, ktorí hovoria, že Urim a Thummim boli vlastne čierna a biely kameň, ktorý bol nosený vo vrecku na hrudi kňaza. Oni by sa modlili a pýtať sa Pána konkrétnu otázku. Pamätáš sa, že Dávid sa pýtal Hospodina na isté otázky: Pane, či máme vyjsť proti Filištíncom? Odpoveď bola: Nie. A na druhý deň zase: Pane, či máme vyjsť proti Filištíncom? Odpoveď bola: Áno. Kedy pôjdeme? Pýtali sa konkrétne otázky a Pán ich nasmeroval cez Urim a Thummin. Hovoria, že kňaz sa bude modliť, hľadať Boha a potom siahne a vytiahne jeden z dvoch kameňov. Ak to bol biely kameň, bola to odpoveď áno. Ak by to bolo nie, potom by to bol čierny kameň, ktorý by vytiahol. Niektorí dokonca hovoria, že dostaneme termín blackballed z tohto Urimu a Thummimu. V skutočnosti, späť v origináli je to nehlasovanie proti konkrétnemu projektu alebo nápadu. Nevieme, čo boli Urim a Thumim, ale počas obdobia Starého zákona používali metódu losovania na určenie Božej vôle.<br/>Takže tu učeníci začínajú to isté, ako hádzajú kocky, aby videli, ktorý z dvoch mužov, ktorých Boh vybral, aby nahradil Judáša Iškariotského.<br/>los padol na Mateja; bol počítaný medzi jedenástich (Skutky 1:26).<br/>Teraz, kto na svete je Matthias? Nikto nikdy nepočul o ňom pred alebo od. Bude zaujímavé stretnúť sa s Matthiasom a zistiť, kto je a čo urobil. Myslím, že z nasledujúcej histórie je zrejmé, že Boh si vybral Pavla ako apoštola. Pavol to sám vyhlasuje. Toto je posledný krát, čo sme o nich čítali, že sa snažia rozlíšiť Božiu vôľu tým, že odhadzujú losy alebo nejakým náhodným spôsobom.<br/>Poznám človeka, ktorý sa dnes snaží rozlíšiť Pánovu vôľu a bude sa modliť a klásť Pánovi otázku. Bude mať vo vrecku desať halierov, a keď sa bude modliť, vezme haliere so zavretými očami a položí ich na stôl, a ak prídu všetky hlavy, je to áno. Zaujímavá vec, raz za čas, všetci prídu hlavy, a to je celkom dobrá šanca. Napriek tomu, nenachádzame žiadny vzor pre toto po Duchu Svätom. Keď Duch Svätý zostúpil na cirkev, Duch Svätý k nim začal hovoriť a usmerňovať ich. A Duch Svätý povedal: "Oddelte mi Pavla a Barnabáša pre službu, kde som ich povolal" (Skutky 13:2). A Duch Svätý ich poslal. Tak sme nájsť cirkev viac priamo vedený Duchom Svätým. Akonáhle prišiel Duch Svätý, to hádzanie kocky zistiť Božiu vôľu bol odložený.<br/>"<br/><br/>King James Verzia<br/><br/>Toto je 1769 King James Version of the Holy Bible (tiež známy ako autorizovaná verzia). |

In fact, dynamic drivers work exactly the same as dynamic microphones but in reverse. Inside a dynamic driver there is a magnet, and when you plug in the headphones, you are sending a AC current through it which will turn the voice coil into a magnet. Depending on the direction of the current, the polarity of the magnet will change. Now since we know for a magnet, same charges repels and different charges attract, we know that the voice coil will move back and forth depending on it's polarity at the time. The voice coil is attached to the diaphragm which will then move back and forth creating a sound wave. The same occurs in reverse, if you move a coil through a magnet you produce a current instead. Since your voice is pushing the diaphragm, it is moving the voice coil back and forth generating the current you have observed.<br/><br/>100+ Head-Fier<br/><br/>Joined:<br/>Nov 7, 2011<br/><br/>Posts:<br/>134<br/><br/>Likes: 55<br/><br/>Exactly.

Teraz, keď vieme, že pre magnet, rovnaké náboje odpudzujú a rôzne náboje priťahujú, vieme, že hlasová cievka sa bude pohybovať tam a späť v závislosti od polarity v tom čase. Hlasová cievka je pripevnená k membráne, ktorá sa potom pohybuje tam a späť a vytvára zvukovú vlnu. To isté sa deje v opačnom prípade, ak presuniete cievku cez magnet, vytvoríte namiesto toho prúd.

Stalin's opposition within the party, including Bukharin, Yagoda and Rykov were purged in these show trials, as Stalin manipulatively forced them to confess to crimes of planning a coup and opposing the state, even if there was no proof. Gabor T Rittersporn said, "Many of the victims were sincerely devoted to the principles of Bolshevism." This amplifies proof that the Bolshevik ideals that had once been the roots of the Communist Party were being disarranged and destroyed by the Purges. The party was depleted and former members helplessly watched Stalin use the great purge as a tool to transform Russia from a one party state to an unchallenged dictatorship. Again, the purges were shattering the framework of the Communist Party, formed during the Bolshevik revolution. This agrees with the "Stalin the executioner" source as both show the manipulative character, that helped the dictator to enhance his grip on Russia's throat.<br/>The manipulative manner, with which Stalin incriminated his targeted opposition during the purges, in the eyes of everyday Russians, also had an implosive impact on Soviet Society. Stalin was able to collect support from the people through his use of propaganda and the media to help him develop a "cult of personality" and the image of a heroic and brave leader. Through this support Stalin implanted mistrust into the minds of the people, convincing them that traitors of the revolution and what he described as 'enemies of the people', were amongst them.

Stalinova opozícia v rámci strany, vrátane Bucharina, Jagody a Rykova, bola v týchto procesoch očistená, pretože Stalin ich manipulatívne prinútil priznať sa k zločinom plánovania prevratu a odporu voči štátu, aj keď neexistoval žiadny dôkaz. Gabor T Rittersporn povedal: "Mnohé z obetí boli úprimne oddané princípom boľševizmu." To zosilňuje dôkaz, že boľševické ideály, ktoré boli kedysi koreňmi komunistickej strany, boli vyčistené a zničené čistkami. Strana bola vyčerpaná a bývalí členovia bezmocne sledovali, ako Stalin použil veľkú čistku ako nástroj na transformáciu Ruska z jedného straníckeho štátu na nespochybniteľnú diktatúru.

Stalin bol schopný zbierať podporu od ľudí prostredníctvom propagandy a médií, aby mu pomohol rozvinúť "kultu osobnosti" a obraz hrdinského a statočného vodcu. Prostredníctvom tejto podpory Stalin implantoval nedôveru do myslí ľudí a presvedčil ich, že medzi nimi boli zradcovia revolúcie a to, čo opísal ako "nepriateľov ľudu".

| Supercell is nerfing brawlers instead of nerfing star powers. I was at 750 last season with power 8 nita and it is very tough to go past that, like, star powers play a really dominant role. The matchmaking is also trash. When i play gem grab(around 600 trophies), there are often matchups where the enemy team has one more player than us who is maxed and it's not even that we have a lvl 9 to compete versus that. Sometimes there are even matchups where the enemy team is fully maxed and none of us are. this is why i dont play brawl stars seriously anymore. It's not even like there arent many players who are not maxed and around 600 trophies. It's annoying.<br/>Edit: I think supercell should have at least a basic mechanism that takes the average of levels of brawlers when setting up matches.<br/><br/>Except trophies don't really indicate your skill. They indicate the skill of the teammates you are placed with. And I'm fine with playing against higher level brawlers, but when one team is all level 10 and the other team isn't, clearly it's unbalanced.<br/><br/>I reccomend getting some good friends to play with, me and 2 friends got my friends power 1 tick to rank 28 by playing gem grab with a certain composition all day and we made it without a single one of us being maxed with our brawlers.<br/><br/>I Know how you feel I used to have brawlers in high trophies with low level and it's to difficult to go more further and everything I was saying to myself "I want to have star powers" really supercell needs to make balance to the star powers or at least make a better matchmaking system.<br/><br/>I kinda feel this. I ain't as good at the game as you, but I got Emz to 500 at power 1 and the matchmaking was horrible. Maxed out players everywhere! And it didn't help that the majority of my teammates had around 5-8k trophies... I had to resort to solo showdown last minute because I can either ambush unsuspecting players or simply play a little aggressive at the right times. But I really wish that it could be a bit easier for people who want to push brawlers to really high trophy ranges without having the luxury of star powers.<br/><br/>Altho spike is still good without curveball. Curveball was just a help for hitting your shots more often as spike. But even before curveball was released, spike was a really strong brawler, so he will remain the same now.<br/><br/>I agree that they should have nerfed ambush, but I think they are trying to balance both Snappy Sniping and Ambush, as they are both getting merged with this change. She was becoming a little powerful, but still not nerf-worthy<br/><br/>I'm not sure about this, but now that Darryl got a noticeable buff, looking at their new stats, it looks like Darryl might overshadow Bull, as not only he can always deal more damage than Bull, he won't die as early anymore, so their survivability will be similar without star power (although Bull's survivability is still noticeably better than Darryl's if he had Tough Guy). Not only that, Darryl's super can auto regenerate, meaning Darryl MIGHT be able to be played effectively both as a heavyweight AND an assassin at the same time (before he sucks as a heavyweight but decent as an assassin)<br/><br/>But hes overrated af. And you get trophies with him really easily. So im kinda ok with the nerf. I havent even played him since when I got him to 500 (around 5 months ago), so not that I care that much either.<br/><br/>Why doesn't Poco/Penny get a HP nerf, if they are Marksman/Healer respectively not a tank?<br/>Why isn't Rosa's tankyness nerfed, cough 70% damage reduction?<br/>Why is Tick allowed to have the highest range and the most free pokedamage in the entire game?<br/>Why doesn't Leon get a HP/Damage buff?<br/><br/>Be that as it may, it was Ambush that was OP, not base Piper. I would argue that Ambush is the best star power in the game (now even more so since the percentage of damage increase indirectly went up) and base Piper was a bottom-10 brawler.<br/><br/>What Supercell should do is revert both nerfs, reduce Ambush to 600, and reduce Snappy Sniping to 0.25 since it'd be indirectly buffed by the base damage buff.<br/><br/>Yea and I believe they went a bit too far with Rosa, because now she is basically the better bull now when it comes to tanking, which she has been for a while. Now, Darryl might as well be a smaller, more powerful bull<br/><br/>Why? I feel she needs a buff in almost everything except her star power. Her health and speed make her super a bit more difficult to use, because she can die pretty easily, and it is really difficult for her to trap faster brawlers like Crow. Her star power is a bit broken though... | Supercell je nervfing brawlers miesto nervfing hviezdnej sily. Bol som na 750 minulú sezónu s výkonom 8 nita a je veľmi ťažké prejsť, že, ako, hviezdne sily hrajú naozaj dominantnú úlohu. Dohadzovanie je tiež odpad. Keď hrám grab (okolo 600 trofejí), sú často zápasy, kde nepriateľský tím má o jedného hráča viac ako my, ktorý je maxed a nie je to ani to, že máme lvl 9, aby sme mohli konkurovať. Niekedy sú dokonca aj zápasy, kde je nepriateľský tím plne maxed a nikto z nás nie je. to je dôvod, prečo už vážne nehrám bojové hviezdy. Nie je to ani tak, že nie je veľa hráčov, ktorí nie sú maxed a okolo 600 trofejí. Je to nepríjemné.<br/>EDIT: Myslím, že superbunka by mala mať aspoň základný mechanizmus, ktorý berie priemernú úroveň brawlerov pri nastavovaní zápasov.<br/><br/>Až na to, že trofeje neindikujú tvoje schopnosti, ale schopnosť tvojich spoluhráčov, s ktorými si bol umiestnený, a ja som v pohode, keď hrám proti rváčom na vyššej úrovni, ale keď je jeden tím na úrovni 10 a druhý nie, je to zjavne nevyvážené.<br/><br/>Odporúčam, aby som si s priateľmi hral s niektorými dobrými priateľmi, ja a 2 priatelia dostali môj priateľ 1 kliešť na 28. miesto hraním gem grab s určitým zložením celý deň a urobili sme to bez toho, aby jeden z nás bol maxed s našimi brawlermi.<br/><br/>Viem, ako sa cítite, že som mal brawlers vo vysokých trofejí s nízkou úrovňou a je ťažké ísť ďalej a všetko, čo som povedal si "Chcem mať hviezdne sily" naozaj superbunka potrebuje, aby sa rovnováha na hviezdne sily, alebo aspoň urobiť lepšie dohadzovací systém.<br/><br/>Cítim to. Nie som tak dobrý v hre ako vy, ale dostal som Emz na 500 pri moci 1 a dohazovanie bolo hrozné. Maxed hráčov všade! A to nepomohlo, že väčšina mojich spoluhráčov mal okolo 5-8k trofeje... Musel som sa uchýliť k samotnému zúčtovaniu na poslednú chvíľu, pretože môžem buď prepadnúť nič netušiacich hráčov, alebo jednoducho hrať trochu agresívne v správny čas. Ale naozaj si želám, aby to bolo o niečo jednoduchšie pre ľudí, ktorí chcú tlačiť brawlery na naozaj vysoké trofeje bez toho, aby mali luxus hviezdnych síl.<br/><br/>Altho hrot je stále dobrý bez curveball. Curveball bol len pomoc pre biť vaše zábery častejšie ako hrot. Ale ešte pred curveball bol prepustený, hrot bol naozaj silný bitka, takže on zostane rovnaký teraz.<br/><br/>Súhlasím, že by mali mať nervózny prepad, ale myslím, že sa snažia vyvážiť Snappy Sniping a Ambush, pretože obaja sa s touto zmenou zlučujú. Stávala sa trochu mocnou, ale stále nie hodná nervov<br/><br/>Nie som si tým istý, ale teraz, keď Darryl dostal nápadný buff, pri pohľade na ich nové štatistiky, vyzerá to, že Darryl by mohol zatieniť Bull, pretože nielenže môže vždy spôsobiť viac škody ako Bull, už nezomrie tak skoro, takže ich prežitie bude podobné bez hviezdnej sily (aj keď Bullova prežitie je stále výrazne lepšie ako Darrylov, ak by mal Tvrdý chlap). A nielen to, Darrylov super sa môže automaticky regenerovať, čo znamená, že Darryl Might môže byť hraný efektívne ako ťažký a zároveň vrah (predtým, ako sa naštve ako ťažký, ale slušný ako vrah)<br/><br/>Ale on je nadhodnotený af. A dostanete trofeje s ním naozaj ľahko. Takže som trochu v poriadku s nervom. Dokonca som ho hral odkedy som ho dostal do 500 (asi pred 5 mesiacmi), takže nie, že by ma to zaujímalo.<br/><br/>Prečo Poco/Penny nedostane HP nerv, ak sú Marksman/Healer resp. nie nádrž?<br/>Prečo nie je Rosina tankovitosť nervózna, kašeľ 70% zníženie poškodenia?<br/>Prečo je povolené, aby Tick mal najvyšší rozsah a najviac voľného pokedamage v celej hre?<br/>Prečo si Leon nekúpi HP/Damage buff?<br/><br/>Nech je to akokoľvek, bol to Ambush, ktorý bol OP, nie základňa Piper. Tvrdil by som, že Ambush je najlepšia hviezdna sila v hre (teraz ešte viac, pretože percento nárastu škôd nepriamo vzrástlo) a základňa Piper bola spodná-10 bitka.<br/><br/>Čo by Supercell mal urobiť, je vrátiť obe nervy, znížiť Ambush na 600 a znížiť Snappy Sniping na 0,25, pretože by to bolo nepriamo ohúrené základným poškodením.<br/><br/>Áno a ja verím, že zašli trochu príliš ďaleko s Rosou, pretože teraz je v podstate lepší býk, pokiaľ ide o tankovanie, ktorým bola na chvíľu. Teraz, Darryl by mohol byť menší, silnejší býk<br/><br/>Prečo? Mám pocit, že potrebuje nadšenie takmer vo všetkom okrem jej hviezdnej sily. Jej zdravie a rýchlosť ju robia super trochu ťažšie na použitie, pretože môže zomrieť celkom ľahko a je pre ňu naozaj ťažké zachytiť rýchlejšie bitky ako Crow. Jej hviezdna sila je trochu zlomená, aj keď... |

You may run a small retail shop, tailoring shop, restaurant, bakery and confectionery, beauty salon, etc. in your locality. You may get engaged in trading or manufacturing on a small scale or providing some service for a price. Such economic activities are known as self-employment.<br/><br/>Meaning of Self-Employment<br/><br/>Earning is necessary for a living. Our father, mother, brothers, sisters and others may be engaged in different economic activities through which they earn their livelihood.

But there are many persons who engage themselves in an occupation or some business which they start and manage on their own. They put in their best effort and take all types of risks to pursue their careers successfully. The entire earning of their work goes to them. All of us have seen small grocery shops, tailoring shops, medical stores etc. in our locality. These are owned and managed by a person, with or without the help of some assistants.

It depends on the income one can earn by producing or buying and selling goods or providing services to others at a price.<br/><br/>In self-employment, the owner alone has to take the profit and bear the risk of loss. So, we find a direct link between the effort and reward in self-employment.<br/><br/>It requires some amount of capital investment, although it may be small.<br/><br/>In self-employment, a person is free to take decisions in respect of running his business profitably and avail of any opportunity that may come up for expansion of his business. It gives complete freedom to work as per one's own will and within the parameters of the prevailing laws.<br/><br/>Thus, self-employment may be defined as, an economic activity which one may perform on his own as a gainful occupation, and this may consist of producing and selling goods, buying and selling goods, or rendering services for a price. | Samostatne zárobkovo činná osoba 1. časť<br/><br/>Keď prijmete zamestnanie v akejkoľvek organizácii, musíte vykonávať rôzne práce podľa požiadaviek vášho zamestnávateľa a môžete získať pevnú výšku príjmu ako plat.
