Undocumented migrants have nothing. They are not allowed to work. They have no right to state benefits nor to a place to live. They are unseen and potentially the most vulnerable group in the UK today.<br/><br/>Undocumented (or irregular) migrants include those trafficked into the sex trade or for domestic servitude; they include visa overstayers; those whose asylum applications have been refused and others who have been subject to failures in the immigration system. All of these may originally have come to the UK legally.<br/><br/>'Illegal immigrants' – those imagined to have entered the country in the backs of lorries – make up a small proportion of the undocumented.<br/><br/>Indeed some sources suggest that half the estimated 120,000 undocumented children in the UK were actually born here to undocumented parents. These children are disadvantaged from birth, solely by their immigration status.<br/><br/>The blog tells the stories of the undocumented. It highlights their daily struggles and vulnerabilities, but also their strength and resilience. It's not an easy read.<br/><br/>You can access the blog via our website (bottom of right hand column on Home Page).<br/><br/>The blog has won the online category of the Speaking Together media awards. The awards were a new addition this year to the Migrant and Refugee Woman of the Year Awards celebration at the Royal Festival Hall in London as part of International Women's Day. The panel of judges – including novelist and playwright Gillian Slovo, and journalist and author, Hannah Pool – was particularly looking for work that challenged myths and stereotypes.<br/><br/>The blog has also won the Blog North Awards 2013 in the Best Writing category and was also shortlisted for an Amnesty International Media Award. | Post ნავიგაცია<br/><br/>"Life Without Papers" საუკეთესო საიუბილეო ჯილდოს მფლობელი გახდა<br/><br/>ბლოგის პროექტი, "ცხოვრება ქაღალდის გარეშე", რომელიც შექმნილია ლენ გრანტის მიერ, მოიცავს მიგრანტთა ოჯახებსა და ახალგაზრდულ ახალგაზრდებს. უმუშევარ მიგრანტებს არაფერი აქვთ. მათ არ აქვთ უფლება მუშაობა. მათ არ აქვთ სახელმწიფო სარგებელი ან ადგილი იცხოვრონ. ეს არის ყველაზე არაპროგნოზირებადი და პოტენციურად დაუცველი ჯგუფი დღეს დიდ ბრიტანეთში.<br/><br/>უმუშევრობა (ან არარეგულარული) მიგრანტები მოიცავს იმ ტრეფიკინგს, რომელიც ჩართულია სექსში ვაჭრობაში ან შიდა მონობაში; მათ შორის არიან ვიზის ზედამხედველები; მათ შორის, რომელთა თავშესაფრის განაცხადების მიღებაზე უარი განაცხადეს და სხვები, რომლებიც იმიგრაციის სისტემაში წარუმატებლობას ექვემდებარებიან. შესაძლოა, ეს ყველაფერი დიდ ბრიტანეთში უკვე მოხდა.<br/><br/>"ინდივიდუალური იმიგრანტი" - ისინი, ვინც წარმოიდგინა, რომ ქვეყანაში შედიან საიმიგრაციო მიწებზე - გააკეთონ უმუშევრობის მცირე პროცენტი.<br/><br/>ზოგ წყაროში ნათქვამია, რომ დიდ ბრიტანეთში 120,000-მდე უმუშევარი ბავშვი დაიბადა უმუშევარი მშობლების გარეშე. ეს ბავშვები დაბადებიდანვე დაიღუპნენ, მხოლოდ მათი საიმიგრაციო სტატუსით.<br/><br/>ბლოგი ეუბნება ისტორიები unobtrusive. იგი ხაზს უსვამს მათი ყოველდღიური ბრძოლა და დაუცველობა, არამედ მათი ძალა და მდგრადობა. ეს არ არის ადვილი წაკითხული.<br/><br/>თქვენ შეგიძლიათ ეწვიოთ ვებ-გვერდს ჩვენი ვებ-გვერდის მეშვეობით (მარჯვენა სვეტის მარჯვენა სვეტის მითითებით).<br/><br/>ბლოგმა გაიმარჯვა ონლაინ კატეგორიაში, რომელზეც საუბარია მედია ჯილდოები. ჯილდოები წელს კიდევ ერთი ახალი დამატება იყო მიგრანტთა და ლტოლვილთა ქალთა წლის დაჯილდოების ცერემონიაზე ლონდონში, როგორც ქალთა საერთაშორისო დღე. მოსამართლეთა პანელი - მათ შორის რომანისტი და დრამატურგი გილლილოვი, ჟურნალისტი და ავტორი, ჰანა აუზი - განსაკუთრებით ეძებდა სამუშაოს, რომელიც ართულებდა მითებსა და სტერეოტიპებს.<br/><br/>ბლოგმა ასევე გაიმარჯვა Blog North Awards 2013-ზე საუკეთესო სამოტივაციო კატეგორიაში და ასევე დაიბეჭდა Amnesty International Media Award-ის ჯილდოზე. |
| Sabbath School Lesson<br/><br/>In Galatians, Paul tackles issues such as freedom, the role of the law in salvation, our condition in Christ, and the nature of the Spirit-led life, as well as the age-old question, How can sinful humans be made right before a holy and just God?<br/><br/>Many scholars believe that Galatians may be the earliest of Paul's letters. It was written in A.D. 49, shortly after the famous Jerusalem Council (Acts 15). Therefore, the book may be the oldest Christian document known. As Acts and Galatians make clear, the early church found itself in a fierce battle over the nature of salvation, especially in the case of Gentiles. According to a group of Jewish believers, known as Judaizers, belief in Jesus alone was not good enough for Gentiles. Gentiles must also be circumcised and follow the laws of Moses (Acts 15:1).<br/><br/>This quarter's Bible study guide invites us to journey with the apostle Paul as he pleads with the Galatians to remain true to Jesus. It also gives us a chance to reflect on our own understanding of the truths that opened the way for Martin Luther's ultimate break with Rome and the restoration of the biblical gospel. | შაბათს სკოლის Lesson<br/><br/>გალატელებში პავლემ ისეთი საკითხები მოიყვანა, როგორიცაა თავისუფლება, რჯულის როლი ხსნაში, ჩვენი მდგომარეობა ქრისტეში და სულიწმინდის ცხოვრების ბუნებაში, ასევე ასაკოვანი კითხვა, როგორ შეიძლება ცოდვილი ადამიანები მართლებად მართლებად და მხოლოდ ღმერთთან?<br/><br/>ბევრი მეცნიერი მიიჩნევს, რომ გალატელები შეიძლება იყოს პავლეს წერილები. იგი დაიწერა A.D. 49, ცოტა ხნის შემდეგ ცნობილი იერუსალიმის საბჭო (საქმეები 15). აქედან გამომდინარე, წიგნი შეიძლება იყოს უძველესი ქრისტიანული დოკუმენტი. როგორც აქტები და გალატელები მკაფიოდ აცხადებენ, ადრეული ეკლესია თავად იქნა ნაპოვნი სასტიკი ბრძოლა გადარჩენის ბუნება, განსაკუთრებით იმ შემთხვევაში, თუ წარმართები. იუდეველთა ჯგუფის თანახმად, ებრაელი მორწმუნეები, რომლებიც ცნობილია, როგორც Judersers, რწმენა იესო მარტო არ იყო საკმარისი წარმართთა. წარმართთა ასევე უნდა წინადაცვეთა და დაიცვას მოსეს კანონი (საქმეები 15:1).<br/><br/>ამ მეოთხედის ბიბლიის შესწავლა გვიწვევს მოგზაურობას პავლე მოციქულის მიერ, როგორც ის მოგვიწოდებს გალატელთა მიმართ, რომ დარჩეს ჭეშმარიტი იესო. ეს ასევე გვაძლევს შესაძლებლობას ვიფიქროთ იმ ჭეშმარიტების შესახებ, რომელიც მარტინ ლუთერის საბოლოო შესვენებას რომთან და ბიბლიური სახარების აღდგენას. |

| Follow Us<br/><br/>ARE YOU AN<br/><br/>INSIDER<br/><br/>Craving Sugar? Here's What Your Body Is Trying to Tell You<br/><br/>by<br/>Byrdie<br/><br/>PHOTO:<br/><br/>Jacquemus<br/><br/>Weight gain from out-of-control cravings aside, it can be frustrating to have a constant hankering for something unhealthy and not know why. The good news is that there's usually a reason underlying that burning desire to house a bag of potato chips, or the feeling that you might actually die if you don't get a pickle rightthisinstant (even though you're not pregnant). If you're having visions of Milky Way bars, for example, it could mean that you're missing a very specific nutrient in your diet. (Yup—it's more complicated than said chocolate bar being so darn delicious.)<br/><br/>We talked to Los Angeles–based dietitian Shira Lenchewski, M.S., R.D., to get the skinny on some common food cravings, as well as what you can do to satiate the hunger without going overboard. Keep scrolling for some seriously good information!<br/><br/>If you're craving chocolate<br/><br/>It means: You could be lacking magnesium in your diet, says Lenchewski. "Magnesium is an essential mineral involved in energy production, glucose metabolism, and muscle function. This is especially true for those hitting the gym hard," she explains. Additionally, magnesium levels lower during the pre-menstrual weeks of your period, which explains why PMS so often comes with chocolate cravings.<br/><br/>Instead, reach for high-quality, low-sugar dark chocolate, which is naturally high in magnesium. "I recommend sticking to 75 per cent cocoa or higher, and pairing it with another magnesium-rich source like sunflower seeds," says Lenchewski. She suggests the chocolate brand Hu, a small-batch food company that focuses on high-quality ingredients produced locally. "It's a little pricey, but all the more reason to keep portions in check," she says. "It's my personal favourite." We're also big fans of superfood-packed Zenbunni.<br/><br/>If you're craving candy<br/><br/>It means: "Craving pure sugar is a good indication that you're running low on energy," says Lenchewski. "Think about it. What is the one thing you're itching for after a terrible night's sleep or at around 4 p.m. during a stressful workday? The answer is usually sugar because it's used as instant fuel for our body's cells."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for apples with nut butter. "If you're raiding your co-workers' candy stash, I recommend a more slow-burn carbohydrate with a source of fat or protein," says Lenchewski. "Unlike simple sugar, this will fuel your cells while avoiding the post-sugar crash. Two options that make for great pick-me-ups the next time you're craving candy: a sliced apple with your choice of nut butter, or berries with 2% unsweetened Greek yoghurt." We like quashing a sweet tooth with these addictive coconut chips, too—they're filling, free of any added sugar, and just so good.<br/><br/>If you're craving salt<br/><br/>It means: "If nothing but the saltiest pickle will do, you may not be drinking enough H2O," says Lenchewski. "Salt helps the body hold on to water, so we crave it when we're in need of fluids."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for water. "Stay hydrated, especially as we approach the summer months," she says. The next time a craving hits, try quenching it (literally) with a few refreshing glasses and you might find the urgency to sodium binge disappears. "If plain water bores you, try adding in mint, lemon, or frozen fruit to mix it up," says Lenchewski. And if that still doesn't do the trick, there's a healthier alternative to bagged chips or fries. "If you're really just craving salt after all, toasted seaweed is a great low-calorie option," she says.<br/><br/>If you're craving starchy carbs like pasta<br/><br/>It means: "Because high-carb foods boost the feel-good hormone serotonin, starch cravings can be a sign you're in need of a mood booster," says Lenchewski.<br/><br/>Instead, reach for a bath! "Bust out the Epsom salts, because it's time for some serious R+R," says Lenchewski. "Trust me. Indulging in a starch free-for-all feels really good in the moment, but it will likely bum you out more the next day." (As anyone who has ever over-indulged a pizza or pasta craving knows.) So the next time you want to dive head first into a bowl of carbs, draw a bath, light a candle, and treat yourself without any regret or dense calories.<br/><br/>If you're craving ice cream<br/><br/>5 / 6<br/><br/>It means: "Your body may be telling you it's in need of some healthy fat."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for coconut ice cream. "I'm a realist, so if you're craving ice cream, I'm not going to recommend a handful of walnuts, which are, of course, full of healthy fat," says Lenchewski. "For ice cream emergencies, I recommend lower-in-sugar coconut ice-creams like Coconut Bliss or Kippy's three-ingredient ice cream in Los Angeles." We can vouch for the fact that coconut ice cream tastes incredible and just like the real thing.<br/><br/>If you're craving a burger<br/><br/>It means: You need iron. "If you can't stop thinking about red meat, there's a chance your body is craving iron, b12 and folic acid," says Lenchewski. "This is especially true during or around that time of the month."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for a healthier burger. "I'm a proponent of grass fed, antibiotic and hormone-free red meat once a week," says Lenchewski. "Try experimenting with an open-faced bison burger—which, cut for cut, is leaner and has more iron than beef." Don't eat meat? Try to incorporate some kind of plant-based iron supplement into your routine, like spirulina. | ჩვენ შესახებ<br/><br/>Ახლა შენ<br/><br/>ინტერაქტივი ფასები<br/><br/>კრუნჩხვები შაქარი? აქ არის რა თქვენი სხეულის ცდილობს გითხრათ<br/><br/>Ახალი ამბები<br/>კვიპროსი<br/><br/>ფოტოსურათი:<br/><br/>ჯაკუზი<br/><br/>წონის მომატება გარეგანი კრუნჩხვებისაგან, შეიძლება იმედგაცრუება ჰქონდეს მუდმივი ჰიპერტენზიის მქონე რაღაც არაჯანსაღი და არ იცის რატომ. კარგი ამბავი ის არის, რომ, როგორც წესი, არსებობს მიზეზი, რომ იწვის სურვილი სახლში ჩანთა კარტოფილი ჩიპი, ან შეგრძნება, რომ თქვენ რეალურად იღუპება, თუ თქვენ არ მიიღოს pickle უფლება მომენტში (მიუხედავად იმისა, რომ თქვენ არ ხართ ორსული). თუ თქვენ გაქვთ მხედველობა Milky Way ბარები, მაგალითად, ეს შეიძლება ნიშნავს, რომ თქვენ დაკარგული ძალიან კონკრეტული საკვები თქვენს დიეტა.

In the room with Alice and Bob, there is a clock that dings every minute. Someone can guess the other's number only at the ding of that clock, but they can also remain silent. If someone correctly guesses the other's number on the first try, both people $1 million.<br/><br/>There is a way to win without any form of communication between Alice and Bob, and, duh, without cheating.

If we're dealing with small numbers, however, it can be played differently. If Alice was told 1, she knows Bob was told 2 because 0 is not a positive (or negative) number.

| Web Services, Vendors And Cyber Laws!<br/><br/>Updated On:April 21, 2014Bilal Ahmad<br/><br/>Computerization of this world changed human performance scenario to a great extent and that too beyond measurement. For instance, Now you can send vital information all across the globe with a single mouse click, thanks to internet connectivity. Sadly, it is this wide connectivity and popularity among people, internet has also increased chances for computer crimes. Internet crimes or computer crimes are widely known as 'Cyber Crimes'.<br/><br/>'Cyber Laws' is something new in the judiciary system but has gained a lot of attention lately. The term cyber crime is something very synonymous with conventional crime, the only difference being medium of execution. There are majorly two types of cyber crimes, the first one is in which computers are the main targets and these include cases of data damage, malicious code and even criminal data access. The second one is in which computer is only a tool using which conventional crimes are committed for eg cyber terrorism, spamming, cyber stalking and many more.<br/><br/>This is where a website consultant or a vendor comes into scene. Although not aware of all the cyber laws present till date, a website vendor can advise you on some of the most vital cyber laws while creating your site.<br/><br/>This may include common knowledge of copy rights or even protecting the content of your own website. Explaining you all the rights you posses as a website owner is also one the tasks a website vendor may do while developing your website. A vendor can also assist you by offering you information on different cyber laws to protect data. Besides all of this, a vendor can also offer you information on any new cyber law that you may not be aware of till know. Cyber laws may vary from nation to nation, one recent example can be of the cookie law released in the United Kingdom, which prevents the website from saving any user browsing data. As per the Cookie Law, websites in the United Kingdom cannot save cookie files without informational consent from the surfer.<br/><br/>It is after the implementation of such law, websites now have a pop-up window, which seeks the consent of the visitor for saving cookies files. Such files are used by websites to analyze the browsing pattern of visitors based on which advertisements are then posted on a user window. With hacking not anymore a new thing for all of us, do you think such rules and regulations can prevent online forgery or cyber crime? Technology has developed at a rapid rate but still people do not prefer shopping online due to fear of personal or bank account details getting hacked. With the rise of cyber crime, need of stringent cyber laws have also increased to curb the same and to promote a risk free shopping experience.<br/><br/>Classes of Cyber Crimes<br/><br/>Over the years there have been three major classes of cyber crimes:<br/><br/>Unauthorized access of computer system cases, which involves hacking or stealing usernames and passwords to gain access over personal information of the respective user. These kind of backdoor access are organized with the help of Trojan Horse. Releasing malicious programs like Trojan House, worms or computer viruses etc. The last class includes cyber stalking a user or online harassment .<br/><br/>Direct implications of Cyber crimes<br/><br/>Decrease in sales<br/><br/>Decrease in staff output due to network delays<br/><br/>Loss of personalized information like research work<br/><br/>Disruption in communication process<br/><br/>Indirect implications of Cyber crimes<br/><br/>Credibility issue in our financial system<br/><br/>Brand image is tarnished in the market<br/><br/>Cyber crimes affect business to business relationship in the market<br/><br/>Sense of trust in state policies and government agencies is lost<br/><br/>Preventing Cyber Crime<br/><br/>As netizens there are certain precautions that we should consider for a safe and secure online experience. Here are some of them:<br/><br/>First thing to do will be to keep personal information to your self and avoid sharing the same online.<br/><br/>Avoid sharing any photographs with online chat friends or strangers.<br/><br/>Installing latest version of anti-virus on your system can offer you a good line of defense against internet threats like viruses and malware.<br/><br/>Keeping back up of your valuable data is a good option to avoid problems like virus contamination.<br/><br/>Avoid sending credit card information to sites that are unsecured and don't have any valid certificate.<br/><br/>Installing safety programme that offers you control over site cookies and saves you from being tracked by websites.<br/><br/>Putting host-based intrusions detection devices on servers will help you keep track of irregularities on your website traffic.<br/><br/>Use of firewall is advised.<br/><br/>Why Cyber attacks are so popular?<br/><br/>Cheaper than traditional cheating methods<br/><br/>Tracking cyber crimes are not easy<br/><br/>Exact locations cannot be tracked easily<br/><br/>Absence of physical barrier in the internet world<br/><br/>Cyber crimes affect large number of people<br/><br/>Conclusion<br/><br/>The fact that human mind has unfathomable power is undeniable, which is why internet crimes are increasing at a tremendous rate. Even history has witnessed some of the greatest internet security gone kaput by the hands of hackers, who have easily got away too. The only way to curb such crime is to remain aware of the cyber laws that we have today, that can either be through internet or through website/IT vendors.
