| Political Selling 101<br/><br/>Written by Dave Stein<br/><br/>Note: To see charts in this article, view it on  Most people who have been selling for even a short period of time understand that some level of corporate politics is present in every organization into which they sell. As sales professionals' experience and political savvy increases, so does what they observe in their accounts. If you aren't aware of political activity in your accounts, it doesn't mean that it isn't there. It just means you can't see it and certainly can't leverage it. If your competitor is politically savvy, you are at a distinct disadvantage. What is politics? According to Merriam-Webster one definition is, "competition between competing interest groups or individuals for power and leadership." Winners have developed a set of skills that enables them to consistently succeed because of, or in spite of, politics. They've learned to select right competing interest groups and then ride power and leadership wave to success by devising and executing political strategies for each key influencer and decision maker. Being adept politically will rarely lead to a win by itself. There are many other components to winning. But to not understand and take advantage of interpersonal forces within an account is to leave assets unleveraged. Here are some of key skills required to elevate yourself into realm of political selling: Skill: A basic understanding of how corporate politics works. For our purposes, politics and influence are synonymous. People need help of other people to achieve certain business goals (i.e. my department's project gets funded) as well as business-driven personal goals (i.e. if it is successful, I get a raise--I can afford that new house). Within a company, it works something like this: "If you report to me I can just tell you to do something and you will do it." That's SAY-SO influence. You'll do it because I say so. But if you don't work for me--let's say you work in another department--it becomes more difficult. I then have to influence you to help me. I'll use POLITICAL influence. That requires a combination of skills and artistry and it takes time and strategy. Here is an example: Let's say that we both work for same company, but for different departments. If I need your help for my department to achieve its quarterly objectives, I might look for ways in which I can help you achieve your objectives (ideally, business and personal objectives) and subtly advertise those to you as benefits of helping me. In that way we are aligned with a set of common interdependent purposes. Win-win. When you are selling into a company, you have absolutely no SAY-SO over buyer. You can't tell anyone in your customer's company what to do. You can only influence them to give you information, insights, coaching and preference so that they influence others to look at you and your offering favorably. The best way to influence someone is to clearly communicate how and by how much you will contribute to advancement of their business and (business-related) personal goals. In diagram below, you'll see that when you can help a buyer or influencer meet their personal and business goals (Quadrant 1), you're much more likely to gain commitment from them in helping you win. In Quadrant 2, there is no personal win, so their commitment, although altruistic so far as a contribution to their company, will not be supported as strongly. Stay away from people in Quadrant 3. In those cases, person you are selling to is "in it for themselves," acting counter to what is in best interests of their company. You run risk of not only losing deal, but being associated with "dirty politics," which could affect your personal and your company's reputation. Quadrant 4 reminds you that if you find you can't contribute to person achieving their business or personal goals, your likelihood of gaining their support is minimal. Don't turn these people into enemies, but focus your efforts on finding and selling to influencers in first quadrant. Skill: The ability to see what's invisible As I suggested earlier, not everyone is skilled enough to observe sophisticated corporate politicians being influential. Savvy politicians do their thing privately. It's not unlike backroom deals done by government politicians. How do you know that there is influence being wielded? First, assume it is. Then begin to look at results and work backward. We can extract a good example from everyday government politics: If there is "pork"--say $650.3 million in corporate tax benefits for igloo manufacturers in Alaska--embedded in a House of Representatives education bill, you can quickly figure out who lent a hand getting it through committee. Ask your contacts within your customer's company or government department about prior purchases, projects and initiatives. Find out who sponsored them, whose budgets paid for them, who were ultimate decision makers and who benefited in some more personal ways. The names you come up with will likely be people of influence, either through their command of an organization, or through astute politicking. They are ones for whose influence you will be positioning during your sales campaign. Skill: Connecting dots You've done some discovery and have begun to make associations. When you asked about recent projects, several people referenced Carrie Miehome, who works in IT organization. She deftly led steering committee with CRM project last year. Funny thing though, that project was put ahead of others that already had funding. Why would that be, you might ask? Who benefits from a CRM implementation? The VP of Sales? The VP of Customer Service? Perhaps CFO who wants more visibility into revenue stream... It's perfectly reasonable to expect that she was influenced by a higher power. The challenge will be finding out whom, what was in it for them and what was in it for her if you are selling IT solutions to that company. Skill: Knowing how to map out organization You'll need to start with an organization chart. If they won't give you one, you can build one by getting answers to pointed questions about reporting structure, by reading information on web and, if your customer is a public company, from corporate SEC filings.<br/><br/>Why Write a Sales Letter for Each Product?<br/><br/>Authors/publishers are great at getting their books written. Entrepreneurs know their products. But after initial one-year honeymoon, sales slow down. To counter this make sure your ebook, product, or service you offer will keep on selling from first day, first year, even for life. Write a short sales letter for each product or ebook.<br/><br/>Whether you have a Web site or not, you can write a first class, must-buy-now sales letter. Write one for each teleclass, eBook, product, or service. I even write one for my bookcoaching services.<br/><br/>If you are like me and have a Web site, it is content driven. Why? Because that's why people come to any site--to get free information. You must also give them a reason to buy. Most home pages say too much about author or book instead of intriguing their potential buyers with a benefit- driven headline, which in turns leads them to benefits of their books--the sales letter.<br/><br/>My first Web site had many fine books and kits in personal growth and book writing and marketing. Sales never went over $200 a month. To correct that, I created a new site and paid special attention to its sales language (without hype) for each teleclass, eBook, and book coaching opportunities to suit each income and need. Sales were $75 first month, and in four months they reached $2265. The next year they went around $3000 a month.<br/><br/>What Every Sales Letter Needs to Pull Orders and Profits<br/><br/>You can write each sales letter in less than four hours first time. As you practice, you can write them in two hours.<br/><br/>1. Start Letter with a Benefit-Driven Headline.<br/><br/>Include these headlines throughout your sales letter. "Want a quick and easy way to quadruple your Online Income in Four Months?<br/><br/>If you answered, "yes" to yourself, headline succeeds, because you will keep reading. If you said "No, I don't believe this, " but I'm curious where this is going," headline still succeeds. You win when your headline seduces your potential customer to read on in your sales letter to discover your product[']s benefits and features, some fine testimonials, and finally to click "buy now" which takes them to order page.<br/><br/>2. List Top Five Benefits of your Product or Service in bullet form.<br/><br/>To define your top benefits start with a list of problems your client or customer wants solutions for. Each specific problem you answer can be labeled a benefit. If you are not rock sure of who your audience is, your sales copy dribbles away and doesn't meet its target. Keep redefining your audience and know as much about them as you can.<br/><br/>Remember that one benefit is top undeniable benefit—usually more money easier, more clients faster, more profits from Web sales, better relationships, and health.<br/><br/>If you have more than five benefits collected in a list, sprinkle rest throughout your copy. How will your book make someone's life easier, richer in time or money, help their personal growth, provide additional income, entertain them? How will your product or service make them a better business person, more attractive, feel better, avoid catastrophe, sickness, or surgery?<br/><br/>3. Address your Potential Buyer's Resistances.<br/><br/>Remember to tell a background story of where they are NOW so they will emotionally connect with your solutions (the product or service). Let's say they want to write an eBook or print book to make themselves "expert," make life-long passive income, or share their unique message. | პოლიტიკური გაყიდვა 101<br/><br/>ორიგინალი დასახელება: Dave Stein<br/><br/>შენიშვნა: ამ სტატიაში ნამუშევრის სანახავად, გადახედეთ იმ ადამიანების უმრავლესობას, ვინც მოკლე დროში ყიდის, მიხვდება, რომ კორპორატიული პოლიტიკის ზოგიერთი დონე ყველა ორგანიზაციაშია წარმოდგენილი, სადაც ისინი ყიდულობენ. როგორც გაყიდვების პროფესიონალების გამოცდილება და პოლიტიკური savvy იზრდება, ასე რომ, რასაც ისინი დაიცვან მათი ანგარიშები. თუ თქვენ არ იცით პოლიტიკური საქმიანობის თქვენს ანგარიშზე, ეს არ ნიშნავს, რომ ეს არ არის იქ. ეს მხოლოდ იმას ნიშნავს, რომ თქვენ ვერ ხედავთ მას და, რა თქმა უნდა, ვერ ბერდება. თუ თქვენი კონკურენტი პოლიტიკურად savvy, თქვენ ხართ განსხვავებული მინუსი. რა არის პოლიტიკა?

| Credits Educational materials for the Footprints for Hope project were created by: Paul Salmons, Head of Curriculum Development, Holocaust Education Development Programme, Institute of Education, University of London, which aims to provide a research-informed, innovative and nationally coordinated programme to help teachers teach about the Holocaust effectively. The principal focus is on developing a national programme of professional development in Holocaust education that will be offered free of charge to teachers in every secondary school in England. Further information can be found at .<br/><br/>The Holocaust Centre is the United Kingdom's only dedicated Holocaust memorial and education centre. Founded by Dr.'s Stephen and James Smith in 1995, the Centre welcomes thousands of visitors each year. In September 2008, the Centre launched 'The Journey', the first dedicated holocaust education centre for primary school children.

The shoe is part of the Collections of the Imperial War Museum London iwm.org.uk. The video for educators was produced by Cornelia Reetz, United Kingdom Holocaust Centre, NottinghamshireWelcome to Resurrection Life of Jesus Church. We are a Bible centered group of believers who desire to grow in the full knowledge of Jesus Christ without compromise to His Word. We believe, teach and practice all things that Jesus taught and were practiced by the Church in the book of the Acts of the Apostles. Jesus called his disciples to be salt and light. Salt is a preservative but it is also something that adds savor and enjoyment to our daily food. Light is a symbol of truth; it is comforting, penetrating, guiding and exposes darkness. We seek to preserve biblical truth and shed the glorious light of the Gospel in a world that is consumed by darkness.<br/><br/>Watch the webcast eaec.org/webcast.htm<br/><br/>ABOUT THE VIDEO<br/><br/>God has given progressive revelations throughout the Bible and it is with this knowledge that we can deduce there was a creation prior to Adam. We don't know how long it lasted but Lucifer was an angel who led a rebellion in heaven and started a war that affected the entire universe. The earth was his planet and he ruled from Eden, the same place where God would later put Adam and Eve. As Lucifer's last stand, the earth would have been damaged and looked much like Berlin did at the end of World War II. This would explain why the Bible speaks about a re-creation and God's call to replenish the earth. Adam and Eve were thrown into the conflict to prove that God is righteous to the angelic world. The rewards are potentially enormous: eternal life and being joint heirs with Jesus Christ.<br/><br/>If there was indeed a pre-Adamic civilization with commerce and war, then you shouldn't be surprised when a new world order emerges in the future that calls for peace and offers membership to anyone who will take an oath of loyalty and receive an identification mark that will give you access to the new financial system. Remember, you have been warnedProcesses in organizations sometimes break, often with little consequence. However, at times a broken process can lead to a catastrophe. A Complex Event Processing engine allows organizations to look out for these risky events and provide meaningful alerts. Come see Intricity's video on Complex Event Processing and see if it might be a good fit for your organization. Roots Of Evolution With Paul James-Griffiths Did the theory of evolution start with Charles Darwin? If not, whose work was he building on, and from where did they get their influences? Paul James-Griffiths is a former ancient history teacher in this talk he presents his research on the origin of the theory of evolution one of the most hopeless moments of her life Erna de Vries clutches at this straw of hope: 'to see the sun again'. A prisoner in the infamous 'Death Block 25' of Auschwitz-Birkenau, the 19-year-old German Jew and her fellow inmates are about to be gassed that very morning. However, she escapes this cruel fate. A so-called 'Mischling' -- a half-Jew -- she is seized from the death block and sent to Ravensbrueck by a special transport for 'Mischlinge'. At Ravensbrueck, a women's concentration camp, Erna de Vries is put into forced labor for the German company Siemens. In May 1945 while on the infamous 'death march' Erna de Vries is finally liberated by US troops.<br/><br/>He will not suffer thy foot to be moved: he that keepeth thee will not slumber.<br/><br/>Behold, he that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep.<br/><br/>The LORD is thy keeper: the LORD is thy shade upon thy right hand.<br/><br/>The sun shall not smite thee by day, nor the moon by night.<br/><br/>The LORD shall preserve thee from all evil: he shall preserve thy soul.<br/><br/>The LORD shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in from this time forth, and even for evermore.<br/><br/>Psalm 121 Peter, the Apostle<br/><br/>"When He hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold" -Job<br/><br/>"I."

| Post oak leaves have distinctive cross shape<br/><br/>So said the eminent Harvard botanist Asa Gray, on page 451 in his encyclopedic "Lessons in Botany and Vegetable Physiology," a book published in 1872.<br/><br/>I got my copy at an old bookstore several years ago. I can't remember where exactly. The book is some 700 pages long, not including a series of gorgeous line drawings of sedges, grasses and ferns in the back. The pages feature fore edge marbling…a bit faded now… and the front and back covers are ornamented, with the monogram of the publishing house. They don't make books like this anymore.<br/><br/>Professor Gray was, of course, referring to what we have as this week's Mystery Plant, the post oak, Quercus stellata. I'm pretty confident that all you botanists out there will recognize this instantly as some sort of oak.<br/><br/>Post oak leaves are bright green, and scratchy on the surfaces.(Photo: Keith Bradley)<br/><br/>Oaks belong to the genus Quercus…and they are not always large trees. Some species, of course, are called "scrub oaks", which seems to me a bit of a botanical "put-down", and other species are good examples of shrubs, not more than about knee-high.<br/><br/>Here in the Southeast, we have about 45 native oak species, most of which can rather easily be differentiated into two groups: "White oaks" (including our Mystery Plant) have rounded lobes, without any points or bristles on the tips.<br/><br/>"Red oaks" feature sharply pointed lobes, each with a prominent bristle at the top. There are some other differences, too.<br/><br/>Post oak is widely distributed in the eastern USA, from southern New England through Missouri and Texas, and then east from there, including northern Florida. It is a deciduous species, producing pale, somewhat shreddy or scaly bark. Really large, old individuals can be over 60 feet tall, and because of this, they make great shade trees along city streets and in parks.<br/><br/>The acorns take one season to mature, and they are a valuable wildlife food source. What most people remember about this species are the leaves. The leaves are bright green, and scratchy on the surfaces. Generally, the leaves have a distinctive cross-shaped ("cruciform") look, with two major lobes projected more or less horizontally from the midrib.<br/><br/>The cross-shape is not always well-developed from individual to individual, however, especially is there has been any hybridization going on. (Oak species are famous for mixing it up with each other.)<br/><br/>And this is interesting: Professor Gray refers to this oak in his book by using an incorrect name. The correct and first valid name came about in 1787, penned by a German botanist named Friedrich von Wangenheim. But for some reason, Gray printed the name Quercus obtusiloba, which had been proposed by the French botanist, Andre Michaux. But Michaux was 15 years late — je regrette.<br/><br/>John Nelson is the curator of the A. C.
