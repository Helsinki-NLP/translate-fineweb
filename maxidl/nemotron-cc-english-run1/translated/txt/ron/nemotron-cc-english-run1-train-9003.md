| The Masterpiece: a Chain Poetry Challenge<br/><br/>John has been writing poetry since his school days. He was awarded the "Best Poet 2014 and 2021" Hubby Awards.<br/><br/>Madame Monet in a Japanese kimono, 1875<br/><br/>Claude Monet [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>A Brief History of Collaborative, Collective, or Chain Poetry<br/><br/>Collaborative,collective, or chain poetry is an alternative and creative technique for writing poetry by more than one person. The principal aim of this type of poetry is to create poems through the collaboration of various authors/poets, trying to form a unified voice while still maintain their individual voices.<br/><br/>Examples of collaboration abound in Japanese poetry. Though the precise accounts and records of many such events are either lost or missing.<br/><br/>One of the most famous examples of collective poetry writing was the poem collection titled Ralentir Travaux by Surrealist French poets André Breton, Paul Éluard and René Char. These three poets collaborated to write the poems in this collection over just five days in 1930.<br/><br/>During the 1940s, Charles Henri Ford, an American poet, invented what he called the "chain poem", where each poet wrote a line and then sent the poem to another person (to continue) in another part of the world, by post.<br/><br/>In 2007 a collection of American collaborative poetry Saints of Hysteria: A Half-Century of Collaborative American Poetry was edited and published by Denise Duhamel, Maureen Seaton and David Trinidad.<br/><br/>Collaborative poetry writing has been used in schools and colleges to teach students teamwork and to discover ways in which they are connected.(source: Wikipedia)<br/><br/>Study of a Figure Outdoors: Woman with a Parasol, facing left, 1886<br/><br/>Claude Monet [Public domain or Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>The Aim of This Article and How to Approach the Challenge<br/><br/>A few years back I wrote an article called "Poem Without an End" which included a Christmas poem I had written that lent itself to being added to. I was amazed by the response as at that stage I only had a few followers here. People wrote a stanza of poetry each in "comments" on the hub to follow on from the previous commenter's stanza. It worked out very well and at the end I compiled all the contributions into a single poem as part of the hub.<br/><br/>Similar challenges have been issued since, including one by Frank Atanacio called "Spirits Sat as Mourners" that was also very successful. The difference being that in that instance contributors wrote their own hubs for their stanza of poetry and placed a link on Frank's original hub.<br/><br/>For this particular challenge I don't expect everyone to spend valuable time writing separate hubs for one stanza of poetry (unless you really want to). The main problem being that to make it effective you would have to copy the previously written parts of the poem onto your hub and would probably be hit with "duplication" label.<br/><br/>So, that being the case, and also to save having to leave links everywhere, I just ask that anyone who wants to take part just write their stanza here in "comments." Check the last comment before yours that is contributing to the challenge and follow on. If I see more than one following from the same stanza I will use my poetic licence to work them in as I deem best.<br/><br/>At some stage when I feel there has been enough stanzas added I will probably call an end to the challenge and then compile them all together as the completed poem as part of the article (also giving credit to each contributor).<br/><br/>Flowered Riverbank, Argenteuil<br/><br/>Claude Monet [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>The Challenge!<br/><br/>Now comes the interesting part. If you join this chain poetry challenge you have to try to keep the style and voice of the poem as close as possible to the preceding verses, so that to uninformed readers it will appear that only one author has written the entire poem.<br/><br/>Sounds easy, you say? Well maybe it would be if the poem had a traditional style, rhyme or meter. But this one doesn't! The poem you will be adding to was started by an acquaintance of mine Andriealphus as a "chain poem challenge" elsewhere. At the time of writing I was the only other person who had accepted the challenge, and because I loved the subject I thought it would be a great challenge for my fellow writers and decided to use it here and see if the response would be better. (I know of a few poets here whose writing would suit this style)<br/><br/>Rules :<br/><br/>Follow on from the previous stanza in comments<br/><br/>Try to retain the voice and style of the poem<br/><br/>Keep your stanza/verse to approximately the same length as those before<br/><br/>Claude Monet was one of the most famous painters in the history of art and a leading figure in the Impressionist movement.<br/><br/>In 1883 Monet moved to Giverny. Here, he loved to paint outdoors in the gardens that he helped create. The water lilies found in the pond had a particular appeal, and he painted several series of them throughout the rest of his life; the Japanese-style bridge over the pond became the subject of several works, as well.<br/><br/>In 1912 Monet painted a series of 12 waterlily paintings commissioned by the Orangerie des Tuileries, a museum in Paris. He chose to make them on a very large scale, and to serve as a "haven of peaceful meditation." This project consumed much of Monet's later years. Monet once stated, "These landscapes of water and reflection have become an obsession for me. It is beyond my strength as an old man, and yet I want to render what I feel."<br/><br/>His health was now an obstacle, as well. Nearly blind, with both of his eyes seriously affected by cataracts, Monet finally agreed to undergo surgery for the ailment in 1923.<br/><br/>Monet's famous water lilies turned redder as his cataracts progressed. After getting corrective surgery he destroyed most of the "red lily" paintings, angry that no one really mentioned it to him. Ironically, these paintings were probably what made his impressionistic style so famous in that time -- artists started taking more risks with color and such during this point. (source: biography.com)<br/><br/>The Masterpiece<br/><br/>"The boy sitting behind you says you look like a masterpiece.<br/><br/>Ask him, has he ever seen a Monet up close?<br/><br/>Close enough to see nothing but muddled strokes of weedy lakeshore?<br/><br/>Close enough to dip his fingers into the ridges<br/><br/>where oil paints hardened under an artist's gaze?<br/><br/>Close enough to breathe onto the blood lilies?<br/><br/>Ask him, why did he paint them red?" (Andriealphus)<br/><br/>He grinned like Carroll's cheshire cat.<br/><br/>"Through clouded and bloodshot eyes I imagine.<br/><br/>Be my waterlilies!" he says,<br/><br/>"Feel my breath and let my fingers delve,<br/><br/>become my masterpiece instead.<br/><br/>A brush has never touched a canvas as fine as your fair skin.<br/><br/>Let the masters weep in jealousy,<br/><br/>and Van Gogh slice his ear in envy at the beauty of your nakedness."(Jodah)<br/><br/>Self portrait with bandaged ear<br/><br/>Vincent van Gogh [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>Responses<br/><br/>Now it's your turn. Please write your response in the comments below, remembering to check those immediately before yours for the last written stanza of the poem. If you do decide to write a separate hub for your stanza of verse, make sure you leave a link here in comments.<br/><br/>The Finished Masterpiece<br/><br/>All contributions have been received and I have put the finished poem together with only some slight edits. I hope everyone is happy with the result. If you think I could improve the order of stanzas etc, feel free to let me know.<br/><br/>Comments<br/><br/>Hey Diana, looks like I have to go add another stanza to the finished poem :)<br/><br/>Thanks for this contribution.Quite beautiful.<br/><br/>Diana L Pierce from Potter County, Pa. on September 19, 2015:<br/><br/>No tears splash water below,<br/><br/>From the bridge beneath his feet,<br/><br/>Nor can his brush paint his thoughts,<br/><br/>From the mystery maid he seeks.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 21, 2015:<br/><br/>Thank you Cris, I am sure everyone appreciates your comment.

And the beauty we can still enjoy today from all his work.<br/><br/>This is a great challenge! I am really looking forward to adding to this.<br/><br/>I first wanted to stop in and let you know that, up for sure. Shared too.<br/><br/>And thank you so much for all the challenges to help the rest of us, keep our mental energy flowing and giving it a work out! You are the best.<br/><br/>The information about LuLu and the free ISBN number is an answered prayer! So, smile my friend. You are a gift!<br/><br/>Hugs. :-)<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 12, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi again Marj. I think I may have all the verses that are going to come. I have been doing my best to arrange them as I think best with just a little editing. I will probably post the finished poem as a separate hub with a link on this one to it. My book is available on Lulu and iBooks...there's a link on one of the earlier comments. I'd really appreciate it if you were to purhase a copy. Bear in mind it's my first eBook so the formatting etc isn't perfect, but it's taken me seven revisions I think to get it where it is. It will all be easier next time. If you need help let me know.<br/><br/>travmaj from australia on August 12, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi John, you have certainly had some excellent responses to your challenge - I'm sure you'll fuse it altogether beautifully although I imagine a difficult task. I'm interested in your poetry books also - I really have to get my act together technologically - I'll try and check it all out...cheers -<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi Jo, both books 'On the Wings of Eagles" and "I Laughed a Smile" have mostly the same content...except the former has one extra poem. Originally they were in different formats, one ePub, the other PDF but now they are both ePub. They are available through Lulu and iBooks, soon Barnes and Noble and Nook (not Amazon). I may try publishing another book through Amazon soon just to see how it compares. Thanks again.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>John, thanks a lot, the info on publishing with Lulu will be quite useful as I'm thinking of publishing but I'm currently torn between Amazon and Lulu. I wanted to purchase one of your books, but I couldn't seem to find them on Amazon. However, I'll probably get it from Lulu. Wishing you every success, you deserve it.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Hey Phyllis, thanks for ontributing. I like it, a perfect ending to the poem I think.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks Faith.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi Jo, I think I have sorted out the poem satisfactorily. Just waiting to see if there is any more to add. Publishing with Lulu wasn't bad and now that I've done it once it will be easier next time. Getting the formatting to look right in the eBook was the hardest, though you and just type it in a word document and Lulu automatically produces the contents page and converts the document to ePub or PDF you can only use certain fonts and have to make sure the chapter names or poem titles are in Heading 1. They also provide a free ISBN number if you want. Overall it was easier than expected however.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Phyllis, this is succinct and beautiful, I love it. Shyron's did an excellent job also, I thought I'd already commented on her verse, but I hadn't.<br/><br/>Phyllis Doyle Burns from High desert of Nevada. on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Wonderful hub, great idea, Jodah. Here is one from me. Short but sweet. Hope it is okay:<br/><br/>And this the beauty be<br/><br/>From Masters past we see<br/><br/>Impressed upon the boy<br/><br/>Bestowed on her with joy<br/><br/>Faith Reaper from southern USA on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks John and Jo. You are kind. Jo, you have always been a brilliant poet. I, too, am looking forward to the end result after John does his magic to pull it all together.<br/><br/>I will share again to see if there are any more takers.<br/><br/>Blessings<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Faith, beautifully done, I find it incredible how someone with such limited vision can teach us so much about beauty, light and shadows. John, looking forward to reading the end result.<br/><br/>By the way, congtats on publishing your poems. How did you find the process of publishing with Lulu?<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks for your great submission Faith. No it's not too late, I'm still compiling the final poem so it should be up for all to see in a day or two.<br/><br/>Faith Reaper from southern USA on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi John,<br/><br/>I apologize for my late submission here to your wonderful challenge. I am off from work a couple of day and decided to give this a go while my husband is resting from knee surgery. If it does not meet with your standards, please feel free to not use it in your final poem or edit as you deem necessary.<br/><br/>Blessings always<br/><br/>Here it goes:<br/><br/>Confessions to friend Georges Clemenceau<br/><br/>Of light encapsulating both torment, joy<br/><br/>Fervent madness in analyzing colors<br/><br/>Consequential spontaneous creations<br/><br/>Season after season of obsession<br/><br/>Capturing different hues in a single moment<br/><br/>Attentive while strolling in Argenteuill<br/><br/>Brushwork bares masterpiece.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 09, 2015:<br/><br/>Just a shout out to see if anyone else still wants to contribute to this chain poem.

Thanks to all who have contributed.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 02, 2015:<br/><br/>Thank you Genna. It appears Monet is a favourite arist of many here. I hope you'll take part in this challenge too :)<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 02, 2015:<br/><br/>Thank you for a great contribution Shyron. This is a very nice verse. Well done.<br/><br/>Genna East from Massachusetts, USA on August 02, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi John...<br/><br/>I started to read this wonderful challenge (Monet is one of my favorite artists), then came back to finish reading some of the beautiful contributions that give this painting a stunning voice through perception and the senses.

I'm so glad you like my contribution. This is a very good idea, I know you'll have fun putting it all together. Take care and my best to you.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks Deb, yes I am impressed by the standard of submissions. I'm looking forward to putting it all together.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Yes Ann, it is good to see the poets among us take up the challenge with some great contributions so far. I just hope Imcan do it justice when it comes to putting it together.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Well done Jo. The word "sublime" comes to mind. I hoped all the poets would rise to the fore, and they have. Love it, thanks for contributing.<br/><br/>Deb Hirt from Stillwater, OK on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>I am excited to see what you end up with here. There are a number of fine poets rising to the challenge, so go to it!<br/><br/>Ann Carr from SW England on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Great one, Jo!<br/><br/>You've got everyone going, John! Rather you than me, putting all this together, but it's going to be a humdinger of a poem when it finally comes to an end - if it ever does! You've really started something.<br/><br/>Ann<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Ok, John here goes nothing! Following from Kim's. I hope it reads well.<br/><br/>And the boy began to walk away<br/><br/>But in his wake, I heard him say<br/><br/>"I took a trip to Orangerie<br/><br/>Where the ghost of Monet still abides<br/><br/>I sat right down and gazed awhile<br/><br/>Until I heard a soft voice cry.<br/><br/>"Have you ever seen a fluid dream?<br/><br/>Where light evolves into what it touch<br/><br/>Where serenity flows through cloudy veil<br/><br/>Where the magician's brush like lightening rush<br/><br/>Have you ever seen a sight sublime?<br/><br/>A child born of distorted illusion<br/><br/>This flowering pond that traps the light<br/><br/>That lift the heart and beckons the soul<br/><br/>An abstract pulchritude up close<br/><br/>Move back, behold; such tranquil delight."<br/><br/>I hope this is in line with what the others have done. Feel free to edit if needed. My best...<br/><br/>Jo.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Alrighty!<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Yes Jo, please do. Anyone is welcome to do more than one stanza. I may add another myself at some stage.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>John, I've decided to have a go, but it's about 16 lines, can I do it in two stanzas following on from Kim's wonderful submission? You can always edit it later.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on July 31, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi Jo, sorry to hear you are under the weather at the moment. I am not in a hurry to close this challenge so I'll keep it open until you are back firing on all cylinders and are able to contribute. You are one of the hubbers I was looking forward to getting a response from as I thought it would suit. Thank you for your kind words, and get well soon.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on July 31, 2015:<br/><br/>Wow! John I can't believe I almost missed your incredible challenged. This is something in which I would have loved to participate since Claude Monet is one of my all times favourite artist. Unfortunately, I must cry off. I'm a bit under the weather with a head full of cotton wool, or so it seems. If the challenge is still open when I get rid of this pesky flu I may give it a go, but I must say, the standard is exceptionally high. Maj took it to another level but all the submissions are brilliant. Kudos to you Andriealphus and the other writers who participated so far in this artistic and creative masterpiece.<br/><br/>My best always Jo.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on July 31, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi again Maj, glad this poem inspired you, and yes it beats watching the cricket especially with the Aussie batsmen performing badly in this third test. It will be an interesting exercise for me to fuse all the stanzas together but should be good.<br/><br/>travmaj from australia on July 30, 2015:<br/><br/>John, thank you, I'm most happy you like my offering. I found the poem intriguing and suddenly felt inspired to write my version in the same mode. I'm not sure I wrote a continuation from the stanza before (alwaysexploring) but I'm sure you will fuse it altogether when the time comes. Love all the responses. I haven't managed any creative writing for yonks, can't wait now to start over, just need some time. (beats watching the cricket too!!!) Cheers John, will be checking in -<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on July 30, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks for checking Dana. I am pleased with the quality of responses so far. I just have to wait and see how many more come in. The final,poem should be great.<br/><br/>Dana Tate from LOS ANGELES on July 30, 2015:<br/><br/>Just checking in to see how things are going, I can't wait for the finished product.

A fost premiat cu premiul "Cel mai bun poet 2014 și 2021" Hubby Awards.<br/><br/>Madame Monet într-un kimono japonez, 1875<br/><br/>Claude Monet [Domeniu public], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>O scurtă istorie a poeziei colaborative, colective sau în lanț<br/><br/>Poezia colaborativă, colectivă sau în lanț este o tehnică alternativă și creativă pentru scrierea poeziei de către mai multe persoane. Scopul principal al acestui tip de poezie este de a crea poezii prin colaborarea diverșilor autori/poeți, încercând să formeze o voce unificată, menținând în același timp vocile lor individuale.<br/><br/>Exemplurile de colaborare abundă în poezia japoneză, deşi relatările şi înregistrările exacte ale multor astfel de evenimente sunt fie pierdute, fie lipsesc.<br/><br/>Unul dintre cele mai renumite exemple de poezie colectivă a fost colecția de poezii intitulată Ralentir Travaux de poeții suprarealiști francezi André Breton, Paul Éluard și René Char. Acești trei poeți au colaborat pentru a scrie poeziile din această colecție în doar cinci zile în 1930.<br/><br/>În anii 1940, Charles Henri Ford, un poet american, a inventat ceea ce el a numit "poemul în lanț", în care fiecare poet a scris o linie și apoi a trimis poemul unei alte persoane (pentru a continua) în altă parte a lumii, prin poștă.<br/><br/>În 2007, o colecție de poezii colaborative americane Saints of Hysteria: A Half-Century of Collaborative American Poetry a fost editată și publicată de Denise Duhamel, Maureen Seaton și David Trinidad.<br/><br/>Scrierea de poezie colaborativă a fost folosită în școli și colegii pentru a preda studenților munca în echipă și pentru a descoperi modalitățile în care sunt conectați.<br/><br/>Studiul unei figuri în aer liber: Femeie cu o umbrelă, cu fața la stânga, 1886<br/><br/>Claude Monet [Domeniu public sau domeniu public], prin Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>Scopul acestui articol și cum să abordăm provocarea<br/><br/>Cu câțiva ani în urmă am scris un articol intitulat "Poem Without an End" care includea un poem de Crăciun la care am scris și la care m-am împrumutat să fiu adăugat. Am fost uimit de răspuns, deoarece la acel moment aveam doar câțiva adepți aici. Oamenii au scris o strofa de poezie fiecare în "comentari" pe hub pentru a urma din strofa comentatorului anterior. A mers foarte bine și la final am compilat toate contribuțiile într-un singur poem ca parte a hub-ului.<br/><br/>Provocări similare au fost emise de atunci, inclusiv una de Frank Atanacio numită "Spirits Sat as Mourners", care a fost, de asemenea, foarte de succes. Diferența este că, în acest caz, contribuitorii și-au scris propriile hub-uri pentru strofa lor de poezie și au plasat un link pe hub-ul original al lui Frank.<br/><br/>Pentru această provocare specială nu mă aștept ca toată lumea să-și petreacă timp prețios scriind hub-uri separate pentru o strofă de poezie (cu excepția cazului în care doriți cu adevărat). Principala problemă este că, pentru a fi eficient, ar trebui să copiați părțile scrise anterior ale poemului pe hub-ul dvs. și, probabil, ar fi lovit cu eticheta "duplicare".<br/><br/>Așa că, fiind cazul, și, de asemenea, pentru a salva trebuie să lase link-uri peste tot, eu doar cer ca oricine care vrea să ia parte doar să scrie strofa lor aici în "comentari". Verificați ultimul comentariu înainte de a ta, care contribuie la provocare și să urmeze. Daca vad mai mult de un urmator din aceeasi strofa, voi folosi licenta mea poetica pentru a le lucra asa cum cred eu ca este mai bine.<br/><br/>La un moment dat, când simt că au fost adăugate suficiente strofe, probabil că voi pune capăt provocării și apoi le voi compila pe toate împreună ca poezie finalizată ca parte a articolului (dand, de asemenea, credit fiecărui contribuitor).<br/><br/>Râu înflorit, Argenteuil<br/><br/>Claude Monet [Domeniu public], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>Provocarea!<br/><br/>Acum vine partea interesantă. Dacă vă alăturați acestei provocări de poezie în lanț, trebuie să încercați să păstrați stilul și vocea poemului cât mai aproape posibil de versetele anterioare, astfel încât cititorilor neinformați să li se pară că doar un singur autor a scris întregul poem.<br/><br/>Sună ușor, spui? Ei bine, poate că ar fi dacă poemul ar avea un stil tradițional, rimă sau metru. Dar acesta nu! Poemul pe care îl veți adăuga a fost inițiat de o cunoștință a mea Andriealphus ca o "provocare de poezie în lanț" în altă parte. La momentul scrierii, eram singura altă persoană care acceptase provocarea și, pentru că îmi plăcea subiectul, m-am gândit că ar fi o mare provocare pentru colegii mei scriitori și am decis să-l folosesc aici și să văd dacă răspunsul ar fi mai bun. (Cunosc câțiva poeți aici a căror scriere s-ar potrivi acestui stil)<br/><br/>Reguli:<br/><br/>Urmăriți din strofa anterioară în comentarii<br/><br/>Încercați să păstrați vocea și stilul poemului<br/><br/>Păstrați strofa / versul la aproximativ aceeași lungime ca cele dinainte<br/><br/>Claude Monet a fost unul dintre cei mai renumiți pictori din istoria artei și o figură de lider în mișcarea impresionistă.<br/><br/>În 1883 Monet s-a mutat la Giverny. Aici, îi plăcea să picteze în aer liber în grădinile pe care le-a ajutat să le creeze. Crinii de apă găsiți în iaz au avut un atracție deosebită, și el a pictat mai multe serii de-a lungul restului vieții sale; podul în stil japonez peste iaz a devenit subiectul mai multor lucrări, de asemenea.<br/><br/>În 1912 Monet a pictat o serie de 12 picturi de crini de apă comandate de Orangerie des Tuileries, un muzeu din Paris. El a ales să le facă pe scară foarte mare, și să servească ca un "rezervor de meditație pașnică". Acest proiect a consumat o mare parte din ultimii ani ai lui Monet. Monet a declarat odată, "Aceste peisaje de apă și reflecție au devenit o obsesie pentru mine. Este dincolo de puterea mea ca un bătrân, și totuși vreau să redau ceea ce simt."<br/><br/>Aproape orb, cu ambii ochi grav afectați de cataractă, Monet a fost în cele din urmă de acord să se supună unei intervenții chirurgicale pentru boala în 1923.<br/><br/>Celebrii crini de apă ai lui Monet au devenit mai roșii pe măsură ce cataracta sa a progresat. După ce a suferit o intervenție chirurgicală corectivă, a distrus majoritatea picturilor "crinului roșu", supărat că nimeni nu i-a spus cu adevărat. În mod ironic, aceste picturi au fost, probabil, ceea ce a făcut stilul său impresionist atât de faimos în acea perioadă -- artiștii au început să-și asume mai multe riscuri cu culoarea și altele asemenea în acest moment.

Aș aprecia foarte mult dacă ați fi pentru a purhase o copie. Rețineți că este prima mea carte electronică, deci formatarea etc nu este perfectă, dar mi-a luat șapte revizuiri cred că pentru a ajunge acolo unde este. Totul va fi mai ușor data viitoare.

Aștept să văd dacă mai este ceva de adăugat. Publicarea cu Lulu nu a fost rea și acum că am făcut-o odată ce va fi mai ușor data viitoare. Obținerea formatării pentru a arăta corect în eBook a fost cea mai dificilă, deși tu și doar tastați-l într-un document de cuvânt și Lulu produce automat pagina de conținut și convertește documentul în ePub sau PDF puteți utiliza numai anumite fonturi și trebuie să vă asigurați că numele capitolului sau titlurile de poezii sunt în titlul 1.

Cum ai găsit procesul de publicare cu Lulu?<br/><br/>John Hansen (autor) din Gondwana Land pe 10 august 2015:<br/><br/>Nu, nu e prea târziu, încă compun poemul final, aşa că ar trebui să fie gata pentru toată lumea să-l vadă într-o zi sau două.<br/><br/>Faith Reaper din sudul SUA pe 10 august 2015:<br/><br/>Bună, John.<br/><br/>Îmi cer scuze pentru depunerea mea târziu aici la provocarea ta minunată.

Sunt un pic sub vreme, cu capul plin de vată de bumbac, sau așa se pare. Dacă provocarea este încă deschisă când scap de această gripă enervantă, s-ar putea să încerc, dar trebuie să spun că standardul este excepțional de ridicat.

| First of all EEQT itself needs to be further developed in order to provide a theoretical and computational answer to the needs of modern quantum engineering<br/>and technology. We need to include classical systems with infinite<br/>numbers of degrees of freedom - like electromagnetic and/or gravitational<br/>field. We also need to include infinite quantum systems so as<br/>to understand and simulate Bose gas and its phase transitions. But, there<br/>are also steps that must be taken far beyond the paradigm of EEQT.<br/>As we have emphasized so many times: quantum theory has yet<br/>to be understood in terms of a "non-linear classical theory." But what we mean by a "classical theory" is something much more advanced and more<br/>general than clasical mechanics or classical field theory. By a "classical theory" we mean first of all, a theory that is not based<br/>on probabilities from the start; a theory in which probabilities appear at a<br/>later stage, derived from the theory; derived perhaps, in a necessary way. Such a theory must not only specify the mathematical objects and their relations but also make "predictions".<br/>A classical theory is, in particular, a theory in which discrete events can happen, events that are "objective." They may be events that affect mainly the physical stratum, but they may be also "mental<br/>events," changes of states of "consciousness;" whatever they are, even if they<br/>are concerned with branchings of universes, - they DO HAPPEN.<br/>Such a theory, encompassing the quantum theory as we know it today,<br/>does not yet exist, but we can envisage its possible shape. Nothing serves better than an example, so let us give here an example of how<br/>such a theory can be construed.<br/>Imagine a theory developed a'la Einstein's unified field theory, but<br/>with variable metric signature, possibly with a complex causal web, multiple<br/>Einstein-Rosen [40] (see also [41]) bridges,<br/>time loops, nondifferrentiability, fractal structure, all of that additionally complicated by variable dimensionality of space and of "time" (cf [42]. Imagine such a theory to be able to accomodate all the four fundamental<br/>forces known to us, but it also involves an extra field, which is different<br/>from physical fields, and which is non-local in the sense that it does not<br/>survive taking a macro-average-limit when causal space-time<br/>structure of Einstein's general relativity is recovered. This extra field<br/>would be a place for "thought forms" and our theory would couple these<br/>thought forms to more "physical" levels of reality. The very concept of<br/>"time" would arise only in one particular limiting structure. Nothing<br/>prevents a theory of such a type to have mathematical structures rich enough to accomodate consciousness and mind. Due to its complexity,<br/>density of time-loops, bubble-like causal structure, making predictions<br/>in such theory is possible only by applying probability -<br/>as it is the case with systems evolving according to deterministic<br/>but chaotic dynamics. Quantum wave function would emerge in such a<br/>theory as an effective way of predicting. That type of explanation<br/>of quantum indeterminism was postulated long ago by I. J. Good. In<br/>[3] he speculated that<br/>quantum indeterminism can be understood if we admit that individual quantum events that actually happen here and now have future<br/>advanced causes as well has past retarded causes.<br/>A glimpse of such a thought<br/>may have occured to Alan Turing when he wrote his famous, already quoted sentence: "prediction must be linear, description must be nonlinear."<br/>A theory going partially in this direction is being developed by L. Nottale<br/>[43] who states the observation, attributed to Feynman, that "the typical paths of quantum mechanical particles are continuous non-differentiable." Then he continues his development of fractal<br/>space-time ideas to conclude with: "The quantum behavior becomes, in this theory,<br/>a manifestation of the fractal geometry of space-time, in the same way gravitation is, in Einstein's theory of general (motion-)relativity, a manifestation of the curvature of space-time.<br/>Another step in this direction comes from the work of Russian scientists - which started with the most original ideas of N.A. Kozyrev [44]<br/>and A. Sakharov [45], and is being developed in Moscow, the Urals and Siberia, see e.g. [46, 47, 48]. | În primul rând, EEQT în sine trebuie dezvoltată în continuare pentru a oferi un răspuns teoretic și computațional la nevoile ingineriei cuantice moderne și a tehnologiei. Trebuie să includem sisteme clasice cu un număr infinit de grade de libertate - cum ar fi câmpul electromagnetic și/sau gravitațional. De asemenea, trebuie să includem sisteme cuantice infinite pentru a înțelege și simula gazul Bose și tranzițiile sale de fază. Dar, există, de asemenea, pași care trebuie luați cu mult dincolo de paradigma EEQT.<br/>După cum am subliniat de atâtea ori: teoria cuantică nu a fost încă înțeleasă în termenii unei „teorii clasice neliniare”. Dar ceea ce înțelegem prin „teorie clasică” este ceva mult mai avansat și mai general decât mecanica clasică sau teoria câmpului clasic. Prin „teorie clasică” ne referim în primul rând la o teorie care nu se bazează încă de la început pe probabilități; o teorie în care probabilitățile apar într-o etapă ulterioară, derivate din teorie; derivate poate, într-un mod necesar. O astfel de teorie nu trebuie doar să specifice obiectele matematice și relațiile lor, ci și să facă "previziuni".<br/>O teorie clasică este, în special, o teorie în care se pot întâmpla evenimente discrete, evenimente care sunt "obiective". Ele pot fi evenimente care afectează în principal stratul fizic, dar ele pot fi, de asemenea, „evenimente mentale”, schimbări ale stărilor de „conștiință”; orice ar fi ele, chiar dacă sunt preocupate de ramificațiile universurilor, – se întâmplă.<br/>O astfel de teorie, care cuprinde teoria cuantică așa cum o cunoaștem astăzi, nu există încă, dar putem să ne imaginăm forma sa posibilă. Nimic nu servește mai bine decât un exemplu, așa că haideți să dăm aici un exemplu despre cum poate fi interpretată o astfel de teorie.<br/>Imaginați-vă că o teorie a dezvoltat o teorie a câmpului unificat a lui Einstein, dar cu semnătură metrică variabilă, posibil cu o rețea cauzală complexă, multiplă.<br/>Einstein-Rosen [40] (a se vedea, de asemenea [41]) poduri, bucle de timp, non-diferențiabilitate, structura fractală, toate acestea complicate în plus de dimensionalitatea variabilă a spațiului și a "timpului" (cf. [42]. Imaginați-vă că o astfel de teorie este capabilă să acomodeze toate cele patru forțe fundamentale cunoscute de noi, dar implică și un câmp suplimentar, care este diferit de câmpurile fizice și care nu este local în sensul că nu supraviețuiește luând o limită macro-medie atunci când se recuperează structura cauzală spațiu-timp a relativității generale a lui Einstein. Acest câmp suplimentar ar fi un loc pentru „formele de gândire”, iar teoria noastră ar cupla aceste forme de gândire la niveluri mai „fizice” ale realității.<br/>"timpul" ar apărea numai într-o anumită structură limitativă. Nimic nu împiedică o teorie de acest tip să aibă structuri matematice suficient de bogate pentru a găzdui conștiința și mintea. Datorită complexității sale, densității buclelor de timp, structurii cauzale asemănătoare bulelor, făcând predicții în această teorie este posibilă numai prin aplicarea probabilității.<br/>așa cum este cazul cu sistemele care evoluează în funcție de dinamica deterministă, dar haotică. Funcția de undă cuantică ar apărea într-o astfel de teorie ca un mod eficient de a prezice. Acest tip de explicaţie a indeterminismului cuantic a fost postulat cu mult timp în urmă de I. J. Good.<br/>El a speculat că indeterminismul cuantic poate fi înțeles dacă admitem că evenimentele cuantice individuale care se întâmplă de fapt aici și au acum cauze avansate viitoare au, de asemenea, cauze întârziate din trecut.<br/>Este posibil ca Alan Turing să fi avut o imagine a unui astfel de gând atunci când a scris faimoasa sa frază, deja citată: „prezicerea trebuie să fie liniară, descrierea trebuie să fie neliniară”.<br/>O teorie care merge parțial în această direcție este dezvoltată de L. Nottale.<br/>[43] care afirmă observația, atribuită lui Feynman, că „căile tipice ale particulelor mecanice cuantice sunt nediferențiabile continuu.” Apoi își continuă dezvoltarea ideilor fractale spațiu-timp pentru a concluziona: „Comportamentul cuantic devine, în această teorie, o manifestare a geometriei fractale a spațiu-timpului, în același mod în care gravitația este, în teoria lui Einstein a relativității generale (mișcării), o manifestare a curburii spațiu-timpului.<br/>Un alt pas în această direcție vine din munca oamenilor de știință ruși - care a început cu cele mai originale idei ale lui N.A. Kozyrev [44]<br/>și A. Saharov [45], și se dezvoltă în Moscova, Uralii și Siberia, vezi de exemplu [46, 47, 48]. |
| Best Nutrition And Exercise For Lose Weight<br/><br/>How is breakfast really healthy?<br/><br/>In the morning like an emperor, at noon like a king, in the evening like a beggar – goes a well-known proverb. A study by the medical organization Endocrine Society confirms the key message behind the saying: It shows that breakfast plays a more important role than is often assumed. In the morning, the human body actually has more than twice as high a metabolic activity as at other times of the day: A large breakfast not only keeps you full for a long time, blood sugar and insulin levels also rise slowly. The appetite for sweets is regulated, we eat snacks less often during the day. Therefore, breakfast should not be skipped even during a diet.<br/><br/>Of course, having a big breakfast doesn't mean that we should have several croissants with nut nougat cream and sweet breakfast pancakes in the morning. Breakfast is healthy best when it is high in protein and fiber, as well as providing vitamins and minerals. Whole grain bread or muesli, oat flakes, fruits and nuts are energy suppliers that are good for you and keep you full for a long time.<br/><br/>The fact that a large breakfast is better than a large dinner does not necessarily mean that breakfast is essential for losing weight. A meta-analysis carried out in 2019 showed, that the total daily energy intake of people who eat breakfast is on average higher, than that of those who do not have breakfast. The latter were on average just under half a kilo lighter. So, according to the results of this major study, you don't necessarily have to eat breakfast if you want to lose weight.<br/><br/>Lose weight with the right diet – that's how easy it is to put healthy on your plate<br/><br/>Eating healthy in no way means less taste. Fresh vegetables, fish or meat as protein sources and other healthy ingredients conjure up taste in the pot and a smile on your lips – ideally also when you step on the scales. A US study has shown that people who cook their own food and consciously deal with what they eat have a body mass index in the normal range. Restaurant visits or fast food, on the other hand, quickly lure you into the sugar trap: Often there is no indication of how much sugar is in salad dressings, how much fat the potatoes were fried in or whether the meat was not treated.<br/><br/>A healthy lunch consists of three parts – the largest part is fruits or vegetables and should cover half of the plate. A quarter of the meal should consist of protein, i.e. fish, meat or tofu. The remaining quarter consists of carbohydrates and is ideally made from whole grain products. Important: Don't eat at your desk in the office, but stimulate your metabolism and ideally take a short walk before or after lunch.<br/><br/>When should you eat to lose weight?<br/><br/>In the evening, you should focus on light meals that are rather low in carbohydrates. These are the least likely to cause insulin to skyrocket, which is good for our body. Vegetables, dairy products and nuts, for example, are well suited for this.<br/><br/>You should also be careful not to have dinner too late. It is best to have eaten until 7 p.m. – then the body can relax and prepare for the night. Sufficient sleep is important for healthy weight loss. A US study found that people who slept about eight hours a night had better fat deposits. So good night! Allow yourself more than six hours of sleep so that you can start the next day fit and refreshed.<br/><br/>Losing weight without exercise – is it really possible?<br/><br/>It would be so easy, if the dream weight could be achieved simply by lowering the calorie intake. But you probably know the wisdom that diet is only one side of the coin and exercise is the other. So nothing helps: Put on your sportswear and off you go!<br/><br/>Anyone who, in addition to the sports program such as jogging, walking or swimming, also lets the elevator go alone and takes the stairs, takes a little detour or uses the bike instead of the car, is doing wellis also called something good. Even simple walking is good for health. | Cea mai bună nutriție și exercițiu pentru pierderea în greutate<br/><br/>Cum este micul dejun într-adevăr sănătos?<br/><br/>Dimineața ca un împărat, la prânz ca un rege, seara ca un cerșetor – spune un proverb bine-cunoscut. Un studiu realizat de organizația medicală Endocrine Society confirmă mesajul cheie din spatele zicalei: arată că micul dejun joacă un rol mai important decât se presupune adesea. Dimineața, organismul uman are de fapt o activitate metabolică de două ori mai mare decât în alte momente ale zilei: un mic dejun mare nu numai că vă menține plini pentru o lungă perioadă de timp, dar nivelul zahărului din sânge și al insulinei crește, de asemenea, încet. Apetitul pentru dulciuri este reglementat, mâncăm gustări mai puțin frecvent în timpul zilei. Prin urmare, micul dejun nu ar trebui să fie sărit chiar și în timpul unei diete.<br/><br/>Desigur, un mic dejun mare nu înseamnă că ar trebui să avem mai multe croissante cu cremă de turtă dulce și clătite pentru micul dejun dimineața. Micul dejun este sănătos cel mai bine atunci când este bogat în proteine și fibre, precum și furnizarea de vitamine și minerale. Pâinea integrală din cereale sau muesli, fulgi de ovăz, fructe și nuci sunt furnizori de energie care sunt bune pentru tine și te păstrează plin pentru o lungă perioadă de timp.<br/><br/>Faptul că un mic dejun mare este mai bun decât o cină mare nu înseamnă neapărat că micul dejun este esențial pentru pierderea în greutate. O meta-analiză efectuată în 2019 a arătat că aportul zilnic total de energie al persoanelor care mănâncă micul dejun este, în medie, mai mare decât cel al celor care nu mănâncă micul dejun. Acestea din urmă au fost, în medie, cu puțin mai ușoare cu jumătate de kilogram. Deci, conform rezultatelor acestui studiu major, nu trebuie neapărat să mănânci micul dejun dacă vrei să slăbești.<br/><br/>Pierdeți în greutate cu dieta potrivită - asta este cât de ușor este să puneți sănătos pe farfurie<br/><br/>Consumul de alimente sănătoase nu înseamnă în niciun fel un gust mai mic. Legumele proaspete, peștele sau carnea ca surse de proteine și alte ingrediente sănătoase evocă gustul în oală și un zâmbet pe buze – în mod ideal, și atunci când călcați pe solzi. Un studiu american a arătat că persoanele care își gătesc propriile alimente și se ocupă conștient de ceea ce mănâncă au un indice de masă corporală în intervalul normal. Vizitele la restaurante sau fast-food, pe de altă parte, te ademenesc rapid în capcana zahărului: Adesea nu există nici un indiciu despre cât de mult zahăr este în sosurile de salată, cât de multă grăsime au fost prăjite cartofii sau dacă carnea nu a fost tratată.<br/><br/>Un prânz sănătos constă din trei părți – cea mai mare parte sunt fructe sau legume și ar trebui să acopere jumătate din farfurie. Un sfert din masă ar trebui să constea din proteine, adică pește, carne sau tofu. Celălalt sfert este alcătuit din carbohidrați și este în mod ideal fabricat din produse din cereale integrale. Important: Nu mâncați la birou în birou, ci stimulați metabolismul și, în mod ideal, faceți o scurtă plimbare înainte sau după prânz.<br/><br/>Când ar trebui să mănânci pentru a pierde în greutate?<br/><br/>Seara, ar trebui să vă concentrați asupra meselor ușoare, care sunt destul de scăzute în carbohidrați. Acestea sunt cele mai puțin susceptibile de a provoca creșterea insulinei, ceea ce este bun pentru corpul nostru. Legumele, produsele lactate și nucile, de exemplu, sunt bine potrivite pentru acest lucru.<br/><br/>De asemenea, trebuie să aveți grijă să nu luați cina prea târziu. Cel mai bine este să mâncați până la 7 p.m. – atunci corpul se poate relaxa și se poate pregăti pentru noapte. Somnul suficient este important pentru pierderea în greutate sănătoasă. Un studiu american a constatat că persoanele care au dormit aproximativ opt ore pe noapte au avut depozite mai bune de grăsime. Deci, noapte bună! Acordați-vă mai mult de șase ore de somn, astfel încât să puteți începe ziua următoare să vă simțiți bine și să vă reîmprospătați.<br/><br/>Pierderea în greutate fără exerciții fizice – este într-adevăr posibil?<br/><br/>Ar fi atât de ușor, dacă greutatea visului ar putea fi atinsă pur și simplu prin scăderea aportului de calorii. Dar probabil știți înțelepciunea că dieta este doar o parte a monedei și exercițiul este cealaltă. Deci, nimic nu ajută: Puneți-vă îmbrăcămintea sportivă și plecați!<br/><br/>Oricine, în plus față de programul sportiv, cum ar fi jogging, mersul pe jos sau înot, lasă, de asemenea, liftul să meargă singur și să ia scările, face un mic ocol sau folosește bicicleta în loc de mașină, face wellis, de asemenea, numit ceva bun. Chiar și mersul pe jos este bun pentru sănătate. |
| Why We Open Sourced the Anvil App Server<br/><br/>Why Open Source?<br/><br/>A little while ago, we open-sourced the Anvil App Server. The community reaction has been great, even a little overwhelming (yes, every reply to that announcement really did land in my inbox!). We've already incorporated a bunch of that feedback into our version 1.2 release. But we keep getting asked, " Why did you open-source such a core part of your product? "<br/><br/>Why do this at all?<br/><br/>Anvil is a tool that makes it as simple as possible to build a web app. We do that by enabling you to build the whole application in one language, Python.<br/><br/>Simple hosting is part of that.<br/><br/>The web platform is broken , and Anvil is our attempt to fix it. And, because there is so much complexity in deploying a web app, a cloud-hosted service was the best way to provide the simplicity we want. That way, you can build your app in the Anvil Editor, and make it live on the Internet with one click.<br/><br/>But we kept hearing from people who said, "that's great, but…"<br/><br/>"…but I need to run this on an offshore platform without reliable internet access"<br/><br/>"…but I want to package my app into an IoT device I sell"<br/><br/>or simply, "…but if I'm putting my eggs in this basket, how can I be sure I can still run my app in ten years' time?"<br/><br/>These are all good points! A cloud service isn't the right solution for everyone. If we want to serve these users, there's got to be some way for them to get their apps out of Anvil and run them locally, under their own complete control.<br/><br/>Open Source: Escape hatch, not an ejector seat<br/><br/>We believe in escape hatches, not ejector seats. At conferences, we sometimes get asked, "can I export this as a Flask+JS app?". Sure, it would be possible – we could generate a server package, compile the client-side Python to Javascript, and spit out a classic web app. But it would have serious drawbacks, because:<br/><br/>Not a comfy ride.<br/><br/>Code generation is an ejector seat. Generated code is better than nothing – at least you can edit it! But the moment you edit that code, you lose all the benefits of the system that generated it. If you're using Anvil because of its drag-and-drop editor and Python in the browser, why should our locally-hosted users have to use vim and Javascript?<br/><br/>So we did it the right way: we open-sourced Anvil's runtime engine. It's the same code that serves your app in our hosted service, and it represents your app the same way. You can edit your code with a text editor, run it, then git push it back into our online IDE. It's not an ejector seat: there's no explosive transition. It's an escape hatch: you can climb out, and climb right back in.<br/><br/>What about our business model?<br/><br/>Anvil was never meant to be one of those enterprise low-code systems that charge you $20/mo for each person who uses your app. Anvil is a developer tool. The apps you develop are yours. Enabling you to run them on a Raspberry Pi is cool, but it doesn't change our business model.<br/><br/>We're doing what we always were: We make and sell a development tool that makes it drastically simpler to build web applications. We provide hosting for Anvil apps. We offer the entire development-and-hosting platform on-site for enterprise customers. And, of course, we offer a free plan so that everyone can use Anvil for hobby or educational purposes – or to start building something and see how it goes.<br/><br/>We've open-sourced the Anvil App Server for the (relatively small) number of people who need it, and to provide the ultimate insurance policy. Sure, you can build an app with vim and host it yourself, without even registering an account with us (we've got docs to show you how!). But the Anvil Editor is the world's easiest way to build a web app, and our hosted service is the easiest way to deploy it – so that's what we expect most of our users to continue doing. And you can build with confidence, knowing that the open-source code is right there if you need it.<br/><br/>Try it yourself<br/><br/>If our development philosophy resonates with you, why not try Anvil yourself? | De ce am deschis sursa Anvil App Server<br/><br/>De ce sursă deschisă?<br/><br/>Cu puțin timp în urmă, am deschis Anvil App Server. Reacția comunității a fost mare, chiar un pic copleșitoare (da, fiecare răspuns la acel anunț a ajuns cu adevărat în inbox-ul meu!). Am încorporat deja o grămadă de feedback în versiunea noastră de lansare 1.2. Dar continuăm să fim întrebați, " De ce ați open-source o astfel de parte de bază a produsului dvs.? "<br/><br/>De ce faci asta?<br/><br/>Anvil este un instrument care face ca construirea unei aplicații web să fie cât mai simplă posibil. Facem acest lucru permițându-vă să construiți întreaga aplicație într-un singur limbaj, Python.<br/><br/>Găzduirea simplă face parte din asta.<br/><br/>Platforma web este stricată, iar Anvil este încercarea noastră de a o repara. Și, pentru că există atât de multă complexitate în implementarea unei aplicații web, un serviciu găzduit în cloud a fost cel mai bun mod de a oferi simplitatea pe care o dorim. În acest fel, vă puteți construi aplicația în Editorul Anvil și o puteți face live pe Internet cu un singur clic.<br/><br/>Dar am tot auzit de la oameni care au spus, "E grozav, dar..."<br/><br/>"... dar am nevoie pentru a rula acest lucru pe o platformă offshore, fără acces fiabil la internet"<br/><br/>"...dar vreau să-mi împachetez aplicația într-un dispozitiv IoT pe care îl vând"<br/><br/>sau pur și simplu, "...dar dacă îmi pun ouăle în acest coș, cum pot fi sigur că pot rula în continuare aplicația mea în zece ani?"<br/><br/>Acestea sunt toate puncte bune! Un serviciu cloud nu este soluția potrivită pentru toată lumea. Dacă vrem să servim acești utilizatori, trebuie să existe o modalitate prin care aceștia să-și scoată aplicațiile din Anvil și să le ruleze local, sub controlul lor complet.<br/><br/>Sursă deschisă: trapa de evacuare, nu un scaun de ejectare<br/><br/>Credem în trapele de evacuare, nu în scaunele de ejectare. La conferințe, uneori suntem întrebați: "Pot exporta acest lucru ca o aplicație Flask+JS?". Sigur, ar fi posibil – am putea genera un pachet de server, compila partea clientului Python la Javascript, și scuipat o aplicație web clasică. Dar ar avea dezavantaje grave, deoarece:<br/><br/>Nu o plimbare confortabilă.<br/><br/>Generarea de cod este un scaun ejector. Codul generat este mai bun decât nimic – cel puțin îl puteți edita! Dar în momentul în care editați acel cod, pierdeți toate beneficiile sistemului care l-a generat. Dacă utilizați Anvil datorită editorului său drag-and-drop și Python în browser, de ce ar trebui utilizatorii noștri găzduiți local să utilizeze vim și Javascript?<br/><br/>Așa că am făcut-o în mod corect: am deschis motorul runtime al lui Anvil. Este același cod care servește aplicația dvs. în serviciul nostru găzduit și reprezintă aplicația dvs. în același mod. Puteți să vă editați codul cu un editor de text, să-l executați, apoi să-l împingeți înapoi în IDE-ul nostru online. Nu este un scaun ejector: nu există o tranziție explozivă. Este o trapa de evacuare: puteți să ieșiți și să urcați înapoi.<br/><br/>Cum rămâne cu modelul nostru de afaceri?<br/><br/>Anvil nu a fost niciodată menit să fie unul dintre acele sisteme low-code de întreprindere care vă taxează 20 $ / lună pentru fiecare persoană care utilizează aplicația dvs. Anvil este un instrument de dezvoltare. Aplicațiile pe care le dezvoltați sunt ale dvs. Permițându-vă să le rulați pe un Raspberry Pi este cool, dar nu schimbă modelul nostru de afaceri.<br/><br/>Facem ceea ce am fost întotdeauna: facem și vindem un instrument de dezvoltare care face drastic mai ușor să construiți aplicații web. Oferim găzduire pentru aplicațiile Anvil. Oferim întreaga platformă de dezvoltare și găzduire la fața locului pentru clienții Enterprise. Și, bineînțeles, oferim un plan gratuit, astfel încât toată lumea să poată folosi Anvil în scopuri de hobby sau educaționale – sau să înceapă să construiască ceva și să vadă cum merge.<br/><br/>Am open-source Anvil App Server pentru numărul (relativ mic) de persoane care au nevoie de el și pentru a oferi asigurarea finală. Sigur, puteți construi o aplicație cu vim și să o găzduiți singur, fără a vă înregistra un cont la noi (avem documente pentru a vă arăta cum!). Dar Anvil Editor este cel mai simplu mod din lume de a construi o aplicație web, iar serviciul nostru găzduit este cel mai simplu mod de a o implementa – așa că ne așteptăm ca majoritatea utilizatorilor noștri să continue să facă acest lucru. Și puteți construi cu încredere, știind că codul open-source este chiar acolo, dacă aveți nevoie de el.<br/><br/>Încearcă-l singur<br/><br/>Dacă filosofia noastră de dezvoltare rezonează cu tine, de ce să nu încerci tu însuți Anvil? |
