Undocumented migrants have nothing. They are not allowed to work. They have no right to state benefits nor to a place to live. They are unseen and potentially the most vulnerable group in the UK today.<br/><br/>Undocumented (or irregular) migrants include those trafficked into the sex trade or for domestic servitude; they include visa overstayers; those whose asylum applications have been refused and others who have been subject to failures in the immigration system. All of these may originally have come to the UK legally.<br/><br/>'Illegal immigrants' – those imagined to have entered the country in the backs of lorries – make up a small proportion of the undocumented.<br/><br/>Indeed some sources suggest that half the estimated 120,000 undocumented children in the UK were actually born here to undocumented parents. These children are disadvantaged from birth, solely by their immigration status.<br/><br/>The blog tells the stories of the undocumented. It highlights their daily struggles and vulnerabilities, but also their strength and resilience. It's not an easy read.<br/><br/>You can access the blog via our website (bottom of right hand column on Home Page).<br/><br/>The blog has won the online category of the Speaking Together media awards. The awards were a new addition this year to the Migrant and Refugee Woman of the Year Awards celebration at the Royal Festival Hall in London as part of International Women's Day. The panel of judges – including novelist and playwright Gillian Slovo, and journalist and author, Hannah Pool – was particularly looking for work that challenged myths and stereotypes.<br/><br/>The blog has also won the Blog North Awards 2013 in the Best Writing category and was also shortlisted for an Amnesty International Media Award. | Navigare articole<br/><br/>„Life Without Papers” câștigă premiul pentru cel mai bun scenariu<br/><br/>Proiectul blogului, "Viața fără documente", creat de Len Grant, prezintă povești despre familiile de migranți fără documente și tineri. Migranții fără documente nu au nimic. Nu li se permite să lucreze. Nu au dreptul la prestații de stat sau la un loc de locuit. Ele sunt nevăzute și pot fi cel mai vulnerabil grup din Marea Britanie astăzi.<br/><br/>Migranții fără documente (sau neregulamentari) includ cei care au fost traficați în comerțul cu sex sau pentru servitute internă; acestea includ persoanele care au depășit termenul de valabilitate a vizelor; cei ale căror cereri de azil au fost refuzate și alții care au fost supuși unor eșecuri în sistemul de imigrare. Toate acestea ar fi putut fi introduse în Marea Britanie în mod legal.<br/><br/>"Imigranții ilegali" - cei care și-au imaginat că au intrat în țară în spatele camioanelor - reprezintă o mică parte din cei fără documente.<br/><br/>Într-adevăr, unele surse sugerează că jumătate din cei 120.000 de copii nedocumentați estimați în Marea Britanie s-au născut de fapt aici din părinți nedocumentați. Acești copii sunt dezavantajați de la naștere, numai din cauza statutului lor de imigranți.<br/><br/>Blogul spune poveștile nedocumentaților. Evidențiază luptele și vulnerabilitățile lor zilnice, dar și puterea și rezistența lor.

| Sabbath School Lesson<br/><br/>In Galatians, Paul tackles issues such as freedom, the role of the law in salvation, our condition in Christ, and the nature of the Spirit-led life, as well as the age-old question, How can sinful humans be made right before a holy and just God?<br/><br/>Many scholars believe that Galatians may be the earliest of Paul's letters. It was written in A.D. 49, shortly after the famous Jerusalem Council (Acts 15). Therefore, the book may be the oldest Christian document known. As Acts and Galatians make clear, the early church found itself in a fierce battle over the nature of salvation, especially in the case of Gentiles. According to a group of Jewish believers, known as Judaizers, belief in Jesus alone was not good enough for Gentiles. Gentiles must also be circumcised and follow the laws of Moses (Acts 15:1).<br/><br/>This quarter's Bible study guide invites us to journey with the apostle Paul as he pleads with the Galatians to remain true to Jesus. It also gives us a chance to reflect on our own understanding of the truths that opened the way for Martin Luther's ultimate break with Rome and the restoration of the biblical gospel. | Școala Sabatului<br/><br/>În Galateni, Pavel abordează chestiuni precum libertatea, rolul legii în mântuire, starea noastră în Hristos și natura vieții conduse de Duhul Sfânt, precum și întrebarea veche: Cum pot oamenii păcătoși să fie îndreptățiți înaintea unui Dumnezeu sfânt și drept?<br/><br/>Mulți cercetători cred că Galateni poate fi cea mai veche dintre scrisorile lui Pavel. Ea a fost scrisă în 49 d.Hr., la scurt timp după faimosul Sinod din Ierusalim (Fapte 15). Prin urmare, cartea poate fi cel mai vechi document creștin cunoscut. După cum arată Faptele Apostolilor şi Galatenii, biserica timpurie s-a confruntat cu o luptă aprigă asupra naturii mântuirii, mai ales în cazul neamurilor. Potrivit unui grup de credincioși evrei, cunoscuți sub numele de iudaizatori, credința în Isus singur nu a fost suficient de bună pentru neamuri. Neamurile trebuie, de asemenea, să fie circumcise și să urmeze legile lui Moise (Faptele Apostolilor 15:1).<br/><br/>Ghidul de studiu al Bibliei din acest sfert ne invită să călătorim cu apostolul Pavel în timp ce el se roagă Galatenilor să rămână fideli lui Isus. De asemenea, ne oferă o șansă de a reflecta asupra propriei noastre înțelegeri a adevărurilor care au deschis calea pentru ruptura finală a lui Martin Luther cu Roma și restaurarea evangheliei biblice. |

Franz Frederick Karl Ludwig Georg Heinrich, Frederick Wilhelm Karl Joseph Ludwig Georg. Frederick a fost considerat popular și inteligent, în timpul domniei sale, împreună cu soția sa frumoasă, Charlotte, viața culturală în oraș mic a atins apogeul. Atât de mulți poeți și artiști și-au petrecut timpul acolo încât Hildburghausen a fost poreclit Klein-Weimar, când ultimul duce de Saxa-Gotha-Altenburg a murit fără descendență în 1825, celelalte ramuri ale casei au decis o rearanjare a ducaturilor Ernestine. La 12 noiembrie 1826, Frederic a devenit Duce de Saxa-Altenburg, căruia i-a dat o primă Lege fundamentală în anul 1831, în schimbul mass-media legate de Frederic, Duce de Saxa-Altenburg pe Wikimedia Commons.<br/><br/>Frederic, Duce de Saxa-Altenburg<br/>–<br/>Frederick<br/><br/>15.<br/>Charlotte Georgina de Mecklenburg-Strelitz<br/>–<br/>Charlotte Georgine s-a născut la Hanovra, Electoratul Brunswick-Lüneburg. Ea a fost cea mai mare fiică a lui Carol al II-lea, Marele Duce de Mecklemburg, Charlotte și surorile ei, regina Louise a Prusiei, regina Frederica a Hanovra și prințesa Therese de Thurn und Taxis, au fost considerate cele mai frumoase femei ale timpului lor. Jean Paul Friedrich Richter a dedicat romanul său Titan celor patru frumoase, Charlotte a crescut în Hanovra, unde tatăl ei a servit ca guvernator, în numele cumnatului său, regele George al III-lea al Regatului Unit, care a trăit la Londra. Când Charlotte avea doisprezece ani, mama ei a murit și ea a fost crescută de sora mamei ei, Charlotte, care s-a căsătorit cu tatăl ei în 1784 și surorile ei au fost aduse de bunica ei, Maria Louise Albertine de Leiningen-Falkenburg-Dagsburg în Darmstadt. La 3 septembrie 1785, la vârsta de cincisprezece ani, Charlotte s-a căsătorit cu ducele Frederick, Duce de Saxa-Altenburg, căsătoria nu a fost una fericită, Charlotte a fost mental superioară lui Frederick, care a început să o ignore. Saxa-Hildburghausen a fost ruinată financiar de politicile dezastruoase ale predecesorilor lui Frederick. Receptorii i-au permis Ducelui și Ducesei doar o Listă Civilă redusă, tatăl Charlottei și doi frați au rămas adesea cu Charlotte în Hildburghausen. În 1787, ea s-a mutat la Hildburghausen permanent și a devenit președintele comitetului de credit. În 1792, bunica Charlottei și surorile ei au fugit în fața armatei franceze care avansa de la Darmstadt la Hildburghausen și bunica ei a observat soțul Charlottei. Din toate îndatoririle sale, el își îndeplinește îndatoririle conjugale cu zel. Charlotte, care nu l-a iubit niciodată pe acest bărbat, este întotdeauna însărcinată, familia a petrecut câteva săptămâni fără griji la Hildburghausen. În 1793, bunica Charlottei s-a întors din exil și a călătorit cu surorile Charlottei la Frankfurt pe Main, Charlotte a avut o relație foarte intimă și iubitoare cu sora ei Friederike și rudele din Strelitz. În 1803 și 1805, cuplul regal prusac a vizitat Hildburghausen, pentru această ocazie, primii au permis cuplului ducal să reînnoiască o parte din mobilierul lor. Louise a ajutat la redactarea declarației de război, Christian Truchseß von Wetzhausen zu Bettenburg a fost un prieten al cuplului ducal și nașul fiului Charlottei, Edward. Mulți spectatori au venit să o vadă pe Prințesa Moștenitoare a Bavariei, când și-a primit oaspeții, Truchseß a încercat să o conducă mai întâi pe Charlotte în castelul său, dar ea a refuzat, referindu-se la fiica ei. Truchseß i-a răspuns: „Înălţimea Voastră mă va ierta, dar atâta timp cât acest castel va sta aici, Tereza i-a apucat pe baroni de celălalt braţ, iar cei trei au trecut prin poartă împreună. Ducesa a dat aproximativ jumătate din veniturile ei săracilor, pensionarilor.<br/><br/>1617.<br/>Prințul Charles de Hesse-Kassel<br/>–<br/>Prințul Charles de Hesse-Kassel a fost un membru cadet al Casei de Hesse-Kassel și un mareșal general danez. Crescut cu rude la curtea daneză, și-a petrecut cea mai mare parte a vieții în Danemarca, iar mama sa a fost fiica regelui George al II-lea al Marii Britanii și a Carolinei de Ansbach și sora reginei Louise a Danemarcei. Tatăl său, viitorul Landgrave, a părăsit familia în 1747, în 1755 a încheiat oficial căsătoria cu Mary. Bunicul, William al VIII-lea, Landgrave de Hesse, a acordat județul Hanau și veniturile sale Mariei, tânărul prinț Charles și cei doi frați ai săi, William și Frederic, au fost crescuți de mama lor și încurajați de rudele protestante din 1747. În 1756, Maria s-a mutat în Danemarca, pentru a avea grijă de copiii minori ai surorii ei, regina Louise a Danemarcei. Cu ea, ea și-a luat fiii care au fost crescuți la curtea de la Palatul Christiansborg din Copenhaga. Prinții hessieni au rămas mai târziu în Danemarca, devenind lorzii săi importanți, doar fratele mai mare William s-a întors în Hesse, în 1785, după ascensiunea la Landgraviat. În 1758 a fost numit colonel, la vârsta de 20 de ani general major, tot în 1766, a fost numit guvernator general al Norvegiei, o poziție pe care a deținut-o până în 1768, dar care a rămas în mare parte titulară, deoarece nu a mers niciodată în Norvegia în această perioadă. În 1763, fratele său mai mare William s-a căsătorit cu vărul lor întâi, Carol a urmat exemplul la 30 august 1766 la Palatul Christiansborg – soția sa a fost Louise a Danemarcei, iar Carol a devenit astfel cumnatul vărului său, regele Christian al VII-lea. Căsătoria a avut loc în ciuda sfaturilor date împotriva ei, din cauza acuzațiilor de desfrânare ale prințului Charles. La scurt timp după aceea, Carol a căzut în dezavantaj la curte, iar la începutul anului 1767 el și cu ei aveau să aibă primul lor copil, Marie Sophie, acolo în 1767 și apoi al doilea lor copil, William, în 1769. În 1768, Charles a cumpărat proprietatea și satul Offenbach-Rumpenheim de la familia Edelsheim. În 1771, el a extins conacul într-un castel și scaun princiar, iar mama sa, Mary, a trăit în palat până la moartea ei în 1772. În 1781, Carol a vândut Palatul Rumpenheim fratelui său mai mic, Carol s-a stabilit la Castelul Gottorp din Schleswig cu familia sa. În 1771, regele Christian al VII-lea i-a dat surorii sale moșia Tegelhof din Güby, între orașul Schleswig și Eckernförde. Din 1772 până în 1776, Carol a avut o reședință de vară construită pe site-ul pe care a numit-o Louisenlund în onoarea soției sale, în septembrie 1772, Carol a fost numit comandant-șef al armatei norvegiene și el și Louise s-au mutat la Christiana. Atribuirea a fost o consecință a loviturii de stat a regelui Gustav al III-lea al Suediei la 19 august 1772, în timp ce în Norvegia, Prințesa Louise a dat naștere celui de-al patrulea copil, Juliane, în 1773.<br/><br/>18.<br/>Prințesa Louise Caroline de Hesse-Kassel<br/>–<br/>Louise Caroline s-a născut la Gottorp, în Ducatul de Schleswig, de la Landgravele Charles de Hesse-Kassel și soția sa, Prințesa Louise a Danemarcei.<br/>–<br/>Prințesa Louise Caroline<br/><br/>- 19.<br/>Prințul Frederick de Hesse<br/>–<br/>Landgrave Frederick<br/><br/>20.<br/>Prințul William de Hesse Prințul William de Hesse<br/>–<br/>Guillaume de Hesse-Kassel<br/><br/>- 212223.<br/>Prințesa Louise24.<br/>Sofia Frederica de Mecklemburg-Schwerin<br/>–<br/>Sophia Frederica de Me252627 matern28.<br/>Albert Azzo al II-lea, Margraf de Milano<br/>–<br/>Alberto Azzo al II-lea, Margraf de Milano, și Liguria, Conte de Gavello și Padova, Rovigo, Lunigiana, Monselice, și Montagnana, aka, Albertezzo al II-lea, a fost un nobil puternic în Sfântul Imperiu Roman. El este considerat fondatorul Casei d'Este, fiind șeful primei familii care a fost stăpânul lui Este, Alberto Azzo al II-lea a fost singurul fiu al lui Albert Azzo I, markgraf de Milano. El a moștenit birourile tatălui său în jurul anului 1020 și și-a sporit continuu proprietățile în nordul Italiei, în 1069-1070, a încercat să dobândească Maine pentru fiul său Hugh, deoarece soția sa, Garsende, a fost co-moștenitoare a conților anteriori din Maine. Hugh a fost declarat conte, dar nu a putut să-l învingă pe Robert, Ducele de Normandia, în controversa investiturii dintre Henric al IV-lea, Împăratul Sfântului Imperiu Roman, și Papa Grigore al VII-lea, Azzo a încercat să medieze, dar mai târziu s-a alăturat partidului papei. În jurul anului 1073 a făcut din castelul din Este reședința sa, din care Casa de Este, înainte de proiectul său de construcție, Este era puțin mai mult decât un sat. Fiul său Welf s-a mutat mai întâi în Carintia și apoi în Bavaria, dând naștere uneia dintre cele mai importante familii din istoria europeană, un alt fiu, Fulk I de Milano, a făcut prima utilizare documentată a titlului de marchiz dEste. Azzo al II-lea s-a căsătorit cu Kunigunde, fiica lui Welf al II-lea, Conte de Altdorf și au avut un copil cunoscut, Welf Duce de Bavaria din 1070 până în 1077 și din 1096 până la moartea sa, care a fost primul membru al ramurii Welf a Casei de Este. A doua sa căsătorie a fost cu Garsende, fiica lui Herbert I, conte de Maine și au avut următorii fii cunoscuți, Fulco I, markgraf de Milano, strămoș al ramurii italiene a Casei de Este Hugo al V-lea, conte de Maine, nu a avut copii. Unele surse spun că s-a căsătorit și cu Vitalia Orseolo, fiica lui Peter Orseolo și a avut o aventură extraconjugală cu Matilda, sora lui William, episcop de Padova, cu care a avut o fiică pe nume Adelasia, care s-a căsătorit cu Guglielmo Adelardi.

El a fost primul membru al ramurii Welf a Casei de Este, în genealogia Casei Bătrâne de Welf el este socotit ca Welf IV. Welf a fost fiul lui Azzo al II-lea de Este și al soției sale, Kunigunde de Altdorf, când unchiul matern al lui Welf, Welf, Duce de Carintia, a murit fără copii, Welf a moștenit proprietatea sa. Welf s-a căsătorit cu Ethelinde de Northeim, fiica lui Otto al II-lea, Duce de Bavaria, când socrul său, Ducele Otto a devenit un dușman al regelui Henric al IV-lea și și-a pierdut ducatul, Welf a rămas loial regelui. În conformitate cu ordinele lui Henric, el a repudiat și a divorțat de ducesa sa, Ethelinde, iar acest eveniment a avut loc la Goslar în 1070, când statele Bavariei s-au supus în liniște noului duce, care era reprezentantul uneia dintre cele mai vechi familii din provincie. Papa și împăratul s-au împăcat superficial în 1076, dar anul acela i-a văzut din nou implicați în ostilități active. Henric, ca urmare a actelor repetate de răzvrătire, l-a declarat pe Welf deposedat de noul său ducat. Cu toate acestea, susținut de bavarezii săi credincioși și ajutat de tatăl său în Italia, Welf a reușit să-și mențină locul, cu toate acestea, Grigore a murit în 1085 și succesorii săi au luat o parte mai puțin intensă în afacerile Germaniei. Welf, deși încă aderă la petrecerea bisericii, după divorț, în 1070, de prima sa soție, Welf s-a căsătorit cu Judith de Flandra, fiica lui Balduin al IV-lea, conte de Flandra, și cu văduva lui Tostig Godwinson, conte de Northumbria. În 1089, fiul lui Welf, Welf, s-a căsătorit cu Matilda de Toscana, consolidând astfel relațiile cu papa; cu toate acestea, după ce Welf cel Tânăr a divorțat de Matilda în 1095, Welf s-a împăcat cu regele Henric al IV-lea și a fost reconfirmat în poziția sa de Duce de Bavaria. După moartea tatălui său Azzo în 1097, Welf a încercat să achiziționeze proprietățile tatălui său la sud de Alpi, în 1099, Welf s-a alăturat Cruciadei din 1101, împreună cu William al IX-lea de Aquitania, Hugh de Vermandois și Ida de Austria. Principalul său succes a fost acela de a preveni o ciocnire între cruciați, care jefuiseră teritoriul bizantin în drum spre Constantinopol, însuși Welf a scăpat de fiasco, dar a murit în drum spre Paphos, Cipru, în 1101 și a fost înmormântat la Abația Weingarten.

Henric a fost fiul Ducelui Welf I de Bavaria din căsătoria sa cu Judith. Ca tânăr, el a administrat proprietatea familiei Este la sud de Alpi, prin căsătoria sa cu Wulfhilde, fiica ducelui Magnus de Saxonia, în jurul anului 1095, a dobândit o parte din moșiile Billung din jurul Lüneburgului. El a aspirat să-l succeadă pe socrul său ca Duce de Saxonia când Magnus a murit fără moștenitori în 1106. Cu toate acestea, Ducele Henric a menținut relații strânse cu dinastia saliană, în 1116, el s-a alăturat celei de-a doua campanii italiene a împăratului Henric al V-lea pentru a cuceri moșiile decedatei Margravine Matilda de Toscana. El i-a succedat fratelui său mai mare Welf al II-lea ca Duce de Bavaria, când acesta din urmă a murit fără copii în 1120, Henric a fost, de asemenea, instrumental în realizarea Concordatului de la Worms din 1122, punând capăt lungului conflict de investitură între Papă și Împărat. Căsătoria a fost încheiată în mai 1127, înstrăinarea dintre dinastiile Welf și Hohenstaufen a durat până în secolul al XIII-lea. După ce Lothar a câștigat alegerile, el a impus o interdicție imperială asupra lui Frederick al II-lea. Henric a murit la scurt timp după aceea și a fost înmormântat la Weingarten, iar soția sa Wulfhilde i-a supraviețuit cu doar 16 zile.

Ambii au intrat în căsătorie în primăvara anului 1202, însoțiți de furnizarea unei zestre semnificative și singurul lor copil a fost Otto, care a moștenit proprietatea tatălui său și a devenit primul Duce de Brunswick-Lüneburg în 1235.

| Follow Us<br/><br/>ARE YOU AN<br/><br/>INSIDER<br/><br/>Craving Sugar? Here's What Your Body Is Trying to Tell You<br/><br/>by<br/>Byrdie<br/><br/>PHOTO:<br/><br/>Jacquemus<br/><br/>Weight gain from out-of-control cravings aside, it can be frustrating to have a constant hankering for something unhealthy and not know why. The good news is that there's usually a reason underlying that burning desire to house a bag of potato chips, or the feeling that you might actually die if you don't get a pickle rightthisinstant (even though you're not pregnant). If you're having visions of Milky Way bars, for example, it could mean that you're missing a very specific nutrient in your diet. (Yup—it's more complicated than said chocolate bar being so darn delicious.)<br/><br/>We talked to Los Angeles–based dietitian Shira Lenchewski, M.S., R.D., to get the skinny on some common food cravings, as well as what you can do to satiate the hunger without going overboard. Keep scrolling for some seriously good information!<br/><br/>If you're craving chocolate<br/><br/>It means: You could be lacking magnesium in your diet, says Lenchewski. "Magnesium is an essential mineral involved in energy production, glucose metabolism, and muscle function. This is especially true for those hitting the gym hard," she explains. Additionally, magnesium levels lower during the pre-menstrual weeks of your period, which explains why PMS so often comes with chocolate cravings.<br/><br/>Instead, reach for high-quality, low-sugar dark chocolate, which is naturally high in magnesium. "I recommend sticking to 75 per cent cocoa or higher, and pairing it with another magnesium-rich source like sunflower seeds," says Lenchewski. She suggests the chocolate brand Hu, a small-batch food company that focuses on high-quality ingredients produced locally. "It's a little pricey, but all the more reason to keep portions in check," she says. "It's my personal favourite." We're also big fans of superfood-packed Zenbunni.<br/><br/>If you're craving candy<br/><br/>It means: "Craving pure sugar is a good indication that you're running low on energy," says Lenchewski. "Think about it. What is the one thing you're itching for after a terrible night's sleep or at around 4 p.m. during a stressful workday? The answer is usually sugar because it's used as instant fuel for our body's cells."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for apples with nut butter. "If you're raiding your co-workers' candy stash, I recommend a more slow-burn carbohydrate with a source of fat or protein," says Lenchewski. "Unlike simple sugar, this will fuel your cells while avoiding the post-sugar crash. Two options that make for great pick-me-ups the next time you're craving candy: a sliced apple with your choice of nut butter, or berries with 2% unsweetened Greek yoghurt." We like quashing a sweet tooth with these addictive coconut chips, too—they're filling, free of any added sugar, and just so good.<br/><br/>If you're craving salt<br/><br/>It means: "If nothing but the saltiest pickle will do, you may not be drinking enough H2O," says Lenchewski. "Salt helps the body hold on to water, so we crave it when we're in need of fluids."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for water. "Stay hydrated, especially as we approach the summer months," she says. The next time a craving hits, try quenching it (literally) with a few refreshing glasses and you might find the urgency to sodium binge disappears. "If plain water bores you, try adding in mint, lemon, or frozen fruit to mix it up," says Lenchewski. And if that still doesn't do the trick, there's a healthier alternative to bagged chips or fries. "If you're really just craving salt after all, toasted seaweed is a great low-calorie option," she says.<br/><br/>If you're craving starchy carbs like pasta<br/><br/>It means: "Because high-carb foods boost the feel-good hormone serotonin, starch cravings can be a sign you're in need of a mood booster," says Lenchewski.<br/><br/>Instead, reach for a bath! "Bust out the Epsom salts, because it's time for some serious R+R," says Lenchewski. "Trust me. Indulging in a starch free-for-all feels really good in the moment, but it will likely bum you out more the next day." (As anyone who has ever over-indulged a pizza or pasta craving knows.) So the next time you want to dive head first into a bowl of carbs, draw a bath, light a candle, and treat yourself without any regret or dense calories.<br/><br/>If you're craving ice cream<br/><br/>5 / 6<br/><br/>It means: "Your body may be telling you it's in need of some healthy fat."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for coconut ice cream. "I'm a realist, so if you're craving ice cream, I'm not going to recommend a handful of walnuts, which are, of course, full of healthy fat," says Lenchewski. "For ice cream emergencies, I recommend lower-in-sugar coconut ice-creams like Coconut Bliss or Kippy's three-ingredient ice cream in Los Angeles." We can vouch for the fact that coconut ice cream tastes incredible and just like the real thing.<br/><br/>If you're craving a burger<br/><br/>It means: You need iron. "If you can't stop thinking about red meat, there's a chance your body is craving iron, b12 and folic acid," says Lenchewski. "This is especially true during or around that time of the month."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for a healthier burger. "I'm a proponent of grass fed, antibiotic and hormone-free red meat once a week," says Lenchewski. "Try experimenting with an open-faced bison burger—which, cut for cut, is leaner and has more iron than beef." Don't eat meat? Try to incorporate some kind of plant-based iron supplement into your routine, like spirulina. | Urmărește-ne pe Facebook<br/><br/>SUNTETI UN<br/><br/>INSIDER<br/><br/>Poftă de zahăr? Iată ce încearcă corpul tău să-ți spună<br/><br/>de<br/>Byrdie<br/><br/>FOTO:<br/><br/>Jacquemus<br/><br/>Creșterea în greutate din pofta de mâncare scăpată de sub control, poate fi frustrant să ai o poftă constantă de ceva nesănătos și să nu știi de ce. Vestea bună este că, de obicei, există un motiv care stă la baza dorinței arzătoare de a găzdui o pungă de chipsuri de cartofi sau sentimentul că ați putea muri de fapt dacă nu obțineți un murături în acest moment (chiar dacă nu sunteți însărcinată). Dacă aveți viziuni despre barele din Calea Lactee, de exemplu, ar putea însemna că vă lipsește un nutrient foarte specific în dieta dvs. (Da, este mai complicat decât bara de ciocolată fiind atât de delicioasă).<br/><br/>Am vorbit cu dieteticianul din Los Angeles, Shira Lenchewski, M.S., R.D., pentru a obține slab pe unele pofte alimentare comune, precum și ceea ce puteți face pentru a sătura foamea fără a merge peste bord. Continuați să defilați pentru unele informații serios bune!<br/><br/>Dacă ai poftă de ciocolată<br/><br/>Aceasta înseamnă: S-ar putea să nu aveți magneziu în dieta dvs., spune Lenchewski. "Magneziul este un mineral esențial implicat în producția de energie, metabolismul glucozei și funcția musculară. Acest lucru este valabil mai ales pentru cei care lovesc greu sala de sport", explică ea. În plus, nivelurile de magneziu scad în timpul săptămânilor premenstruale ale menstruației, ceea ce explică de ce PMS vine atât de des cu pofte de ciocolată.<br/><br/>În schimb, atingeți ciocolata neagră de înaltă calitate, cu conținut scăzut de zahăr, care este în mod natural bogată în magneziu. "Recomand să rămâneți la 75% cacao sau mai mult și să o combinați cu o altă sursă bogată în magneziu, cum ar fi semințele de floarea-soarelui", spune Lenchewski. Ea sugerează marca de ciocolată Hu, o companie de produse alimentare cu loturi mici care se concentrează pe ingrediente de înaltă calitate produse local. "Este un pic scump, dar cu atât mai mult un motiv pentru a păstra porțiunile sub control", spune ea. "Este preferatul meu personal." De asemenea, suntem mari fani ai super-alimentelor Zenbunni.<br/><br/>Dacă îţi doreşti bomboane<br/><br/>Înseamnă: „Tânjirea după zahăr pur este un bun indiciu că ești lipsit de energie”, spune Lenchewski. „Gândiți-vă la asta. Care este singurul lucru pe care îl mângâi după un somn groaznic sau în jurul orei 4 în timpul unei zile de lucru stresante? Răspunsul este de obicei zahărul, deoarece este folosit ca combustibil instantaneu pentru celulele corpului nostru.<br/><br/>În schimb, atingeți merele cu unt de nuci. "Dacă vă raidează stocul de bomboane al colegilor dvs. de muncă, vă recomandăm un carbohidrat cu ardere mai lentă, cu o sursă de grăsimi sau proteine", spune Lenchewski. Spre deosebire de zahărul simplu, acest lucru va alimenta celulele, evitând în același timp accidentul post-zahăr. Două opțiuni care fac pentru mare pick-me-ups data viitoare când doriți bomboane: un măr feliat cu alegerea de unt de nuci, sau fructe de padure cu 2% iaurt grecesc neîndulcit. Ne place să anulăm un dinte dulce cu aceste chipsuri de nucă de cocos dependente, de asemenea – sunt umplute, fără zahăr adăugat și la fel de bune.<br/><br/>Dacă ai poftă de sare<br/><br/>Înseamnă: "Dacă nimic altceva decât murăturile cele mai sărate va face, este posibil să nu beți suficient H2O", spune Lenchewski. "Sarul ajută organismul să țină apă, așa că îl dorim atunci când avem nevoie de lichide."<br/><br/>În schimb, atingeți apa. "Rămâneți hidratați, mai ales pe măsură ce ne apropiem de lunile de vară", spune ea. Data viitoare când apare o poftă, încercați să o stingeți (literal) cu câteva pahare răcoritoare și s-ar putea să descoperiți că urgența consumului excesiv de sodiu dispare. "Dacă apa simplă te plictisește, încearcă să adaugi mentă, lămâie sau fructe congelate pentru a o amesteca", spune Lenchewski. Și dacă acest lucru tot nu face trucul, există o alternativă mai sănătoasă la chips-urile în saci sau cartofii prăjiți. "Dacă sunteți într-adevăr doar pofta de sare, la urma urmei, algele prăjite este o opțiune excelentă cu conținut scăzut de calorii", spune ea.<br/><br/>Dacă îți dorești carbohidrați amidonați ca pastele<br/><br/>Aceasta înseamnă: "Pentru că alimentele bogate în carbohidrați stimulează serotonina hormonului de senzație de bine, pofta de amidon poate fi un semn că aveți nevoie de un stimulent al dispoziției", spune Lenchewski.<br/><br/>În schimb, luați o baie! "Sărați sărurile Epsom, pentru că este timpul pentru un R + R serios", spune Lenchewski. "Aveți încredere în mine. Răsfățarea într-un amidon gratuit pentru toți se simte foarte bine în acest moment, dar este posibil să vă deranjeze mai mult a doua zi." (Așa cum știe oricine care a mâncat vreodată o pizza sau o pastă.) Deci, data viitoare când doriți să vă scufundați capul mai întâi într-un castron cu carbohidrați, trageți o baie, aprindeți o lumânare și tratați-vă fără regrete sau calorii dense.<br/><br/>Dacă ai poftă de îngheţată<br/><br/>5 / 6<br/><br/>Înseamnă: „Corpul tău îți poate spune că are nevoie de grăsimi sănătoase.”<br/><br/>"Sunt un realist, așa că, dacă doriți înghețată, nu am de gând să recomand o mână de nuci, care sunt, desigur, pline de grăsimi sănătoase", spune Lenchewski. "Pentru urgențe de înghețată, recomand înghețată de nucă de cocos cu conținut scăzut de zahăr, cum ar fi Coconut Bliss sau înghețata Kippy cu trei ingrediente din Los Angeles." Putem garanta faptul că înghețata de nucă de cocos are un gust incredibil și exact ca lucrul real.<br/><br/>Dacă îţi doreşti un burger<br/><br/>Înseamnă: aveți nevoie de fier. "Dacă nu vă puteți opri să vă gândiți la carnea roșie, există o șansă ca organismul dvs. să poftească fier, b12 și acid folic", spune Lenchewski. "Acest lucru este valabil mai ales în timpul sau în jurul acelei perioade a lunii."<br/><br/>În schimb, atingeți un burger mai sănătos. "Sunt un susținător al cărnii roșii hrănite cu iarbă, antibiotice și fără hormoni o dată pe săptămână", spune Lenchewski. "Încearcă să experimentezi cu un burger de bizon cu față deschisă - care, tăiat pentru tăiat, este mai slab și are mai mult fier decât carnea de vită." Încercați să încorporați un fel de supliment de fier pe bază de plante în rutina dvs., cum ar fi spirulina. |

| Web Services, Vendors And Cyber Laws!<br/><br/>Updated On:April 21, 2014Bilal Ahmad<br/><br/>Computerization of this world changed human performance scenario to a great extent and that too beyond measurement. For instance, Now you can send vital information all across the globe with a single mouse click, thanks to internet connectivity. Sadly, it is this wide connectivity and popularity among people, internet has also increased chances for computer crimes. Internet crimes or computer crimes are widely known as 'Cyber Crimes'.<br/><br/>'Cyber Laws' is something new in the judiciary system but has gained a lot of attention lately. The term cyber crime is something very synonymous with conventional crime, the only difference being medium of execution. There are majorly two types of cyber crimes, the first one is in which computers are the main targets and these include cases of data damage, malicious code and even criminal data access. The second one is in which computer is only a tool using which conventional crimes are committed for eg cyber terrorism, spamming, cyber stalking and many more.<br/><br/>This is where a website consultant or a vendor comes into scene. Although not aware of all the cyber laws present till date, a website vendor can advise you on some of the most vital cyber laws while creating your site.<br/><br/>This may include common knowledge of copy rights or even protecting the content of your own website. Explaining you all the rights you posses as a website owner is also one the tasks a website vendor may do while developing your website. A vendor can also assist you by offering you information on different cyber laws to protect data. Besides all of this, a vendor can also offer you information on any new cyber law that you may not be aware of till know. Cyber laws may vary from nation to nation, one recent example can be of the cookie law released in the United Kingdom, which prevents the website from saving any user browsing data. As per the Cookie Law, websites in the United Kingdom cannot save cookie files without informational consent from the surfer.<br/><br/>It is after the implementation of such law, websites now have a pop-up window, which seeks the consent of the visitor for saving cookies files. Such files are used by websites to analyze the browsing pattern of visitors based on which advertisements are then posted on a user window. With hacking not anymore a new thing for all of us, do you think such rules and regulations can prevent online forgery or cyber crime? Technology has developed at a rapid rate but still people do not prefer shopping online due to fear of personal or bank account details getting hacked. With the rise of cyber crime, need of stringent cyber laws have also increased to curb the same and to promote a risk free shopping experience.<br/><br/>Classes of Cyber Crimes<br/><br/>Over the years there have been three major classes of cyber crimes:<br/><br/>Unauthorized access of computer system cases, which involves hacking or stealing usernames and passwords to gain access over personal information of the respective user. These kind of backdoor access are organized with the help of Trojan Horse. Releasing malicious programs like Trojan House, worms or computer viruses etc. The last class includes cyber stalking a user or online harassment .<br/><br/>Direct implications of Cyber crimes<br/><br/>Decrease in sales<br/><br/>Decrease in staff output due to network delays<br/><br/>Loss of personalized information like research work<br/><br/>Disruption in communication process<br/><br/>Indirect implications of Cyber crimes<br/><br/>Credibility issue in our financial system<br/><br/>Brand image is tarnished in the market<br/><br/>Cyber crimes affect business to business relationship in the market<br/><br/>Sense of trust in state policies and government agencies is lost<br/><br/>Preventing Cyber Crime<br/><br/>As netizens there are certain precautions that we should consider for a safe and secure online experience. Here are some of them:<br/><br/>First thing to do will be to keep personal information to your self and avoid sharing the same online.<br/><br/>Avoid sharing any photographs with online chat friends or strangers.<br/><br/>Installing latest version of anti-virus on your system can offer you a good line of defense against internet threats like viruses and malware.<br/><br/>Keeping back up of your valuable data is a good option to avoid problems like virus contamination.<br/><br/>Avoid sending credit card information to sites that are unsecured and don't have any valid certificate.<br/><br/>Installing safety programme that offers you control over site cookies and saves you from being tracked by websites.<br/><br/>Putting host-based intrusions detection devices on servers will help you keep track of irregularities on your website traffic.<br/><br/>Use of firewall is advised.<br/><br/>Why Cyber attacks are so popular?<br/><br/>Cheaper than traditional cheating methods<br/><br/>Tracking cyber crimes are not easy<br/><br/>Exact locations cannot be tracked easily<br/><br/>Absence of physical barrier in the internet world<br/><br/>Cyber crimes affect large number of people<br/><br/>Conclusion<br/><br/>The fact that human mind has unfathomable power is undeniable, which is why internet crimes are increasing at a tremendous rate. Even history has witnessed some of the greatest internet security gone kaput by the hands of hackers, who have easily got away too. The only way to curb such crime is to remain aware of the cyber laws that we have today, that can either be through internet or through website/IT vendors. Information Technology Act has to be balanced in such a way that it proves too stringent for people who are involved in cyber crimes and at the same time it should never hamper the growth of Internet industry.<br/><br/>Author Bio:– Maneet Puri at present is heading a quality web design firm located at New Delhi, India. With unmatchable expertise in technical domain, he has been offering professional web consultation services to his clients located all round the globe. He is also an avid writer and some of his commended work have been published on renowned websites | Servicii web, vânzători și legi cibernetice!<br/><br/>Actualizat la:Aprilie 21, 2014Bilal Ahmad<br/><br/>Computerizarea acestei lumi a schimbat scenariul de performanță umană într-o mare măsură și că prea dincolo de măsurare. De exemplu, Acum puteți trimite informații vitale peste tot în lume cu un singur clic al mouse-ului, datorită conectivității la internet. Din păcate, este această conectivitate largă și popularitate în rândul oamenilor, internetul a crescut, de asemenea, șansele de infracțiuni informatice. Infracțiuni pe internet sau infracțiuni informatice sunt cunoscute pe scară largă ca "Cyber Crimes".<br/><br/>'Legile cibernetice' este ceva nou în sistemul judiciar, dar a câștigat o mulțime de atenție în ultima vreme. Termenul de criminalitate cibernetică este ceva foarte sinonim cu criminalitatea convențională, singura diferență fiind mijlocul de execuție. Există în mare parte două tipuri de infracțiuni cibernetice, prima fiind cea în care computerele sunt principalele ținte și acestea includ cazuri de deteriorare a datelor, cod rău intenționat și chiar acces la date criminale. Al doilea este în care computerul este doar un instrument care utilizează infracțiuni convenționale comise pentru, de exemplu, terorism cibernetic, spam, urmărire cibernetică și multe altele.<br/><br/>Aici intră în scenă un consultant sau un vânzător de site-uri web. Deși nu este conștient de toate legile cibernetice prezente până în prezent, un vânzător de site-uri web vă poate sfătui cu privire la unele dintre cele mai importante legi cibernetice în timpul creării site-ului dvs.<br/><br/>Aceasta poate include cunoașterea comună a drepturilor de copiere sau chiar protejarea conținutului propriului site web. Explicarea tuturor drepturilor pe care le dețineți ca proprietar al site-ului web este, de asemenea, una dintre sarcinile pe care un vânzător de site-uri web le poate face în timpul dezvoltării site-ului dvs. web. Un vânzător vă poate ajuta, de asemenea, oferindu-vă informații despre diferite legi cibernetice pentru a proteja datele. În plus față de toate acestea, un vânzător vă poate oferi, de asemenea, informații despre orice nouă lege cibernetică pe care s-ar putea să nu fiți conștienți până nu știți. Legile cibernetice pot varia de la o națiune la alta, un exemplu recent poate fi legea privind cookie-urile lansată în Marea Britanie, care împiedică site-ul să salveze orice date de navigare ale utilizatorilor. În conformitate cu Legea privind cookie-urile, site-urile din Marea Britanie nu pot salva fișiere cookie fără consimțământul informațional al navigatorului.<br/><br/>După punerea în aplicare a unei astfel de legi, site-urile web au acum o fereastră pop-up, care solicită consimțământul vizitatorului pentru salvarea fișierelor cookie. Astfel de fișiere sunt utilizate de site-urile web pentru a analiza modelul de navigare al vizitatorilor pe baza căror reclame sunt apoi afișate într-o fereastră a utilizatorului. Cu hacking-ul nu mai este un lucru nou pentru noi toți, credeți că astfel de reguli și reglementări pot preveni falsificarea online sau criminalitatea cibernetică? Tehnologia s-a dezvoltat într-un ritm rapid, dar încă oamenii nu preferă să facă cumpărături online din cauza fricii de a fi piratate detaliile personale sau ale contului bancar. Odată cu creșterea criminalității cibernetice, nevoia de legi cibernetice stricte a crescut, de asemenea, pentru a reduce acest lucru și pentru a promova o experiență de cumpărături fără riscuri.<br/><br/>Clasele de infracțiuni cibernetice<br/><br/>De-a lungul anilor, au existat trei clase majore de infracțiuni cibernetice:<br/><br/>Acces neautorizat la cazurile de sistem informatic, care implică hacking sau furt de nume de utilizator și parole pentru a obține acces prin intermediul informațiilor personale ale utilizatorului respectiv. Acest tip de acces backdoor sunt organizate cu ajutorul Calului Troian. Eliberarea de programe rău intenționate, cum ar fi Trojan House, viermi sau viruși de calculator etc. Ultima clasă include hărțuirea cibernetică a unui utilizator sau hărțuirea online.<br/><br/>Implicațiile directe ale infracțiunilor cibernetice<br/><br/>Scăderea vânzărilor<br/><br/>Scăderea producției de personal din cauza întârzierilor în rețea<br/><br/>Pierderea informațiilor personalizate, cum ar fi munca de cercetare<br/><br/>Perturbarea procesului de comunicare<br/><br/>Implicațiile indirecte ale infracțiunilor cibernetice<br/><br/>Probleme de credibilitate în sistemul nostru financiar<br/><br/>Imaginea mărcii este murdară pe piață<br/><br/>Infracțiunile cibernetice afectează relațiile de afaceri pe piață<br/><br/>Sensul încrederii în politicile de stat și agențiile guvernamentale este pierdut<br/><br/>Prevenirea criminalității cibernetice<br/><br/>În calitate de internauți, există anumite măsuri de precauție pe care ar trebui să le luăm în considerare pentru o experiență online sigură și securizată. Iată câteva dintre ele:<br/><br/>Primul lucru pe care trebuie să-l faci este să păstrezi informațiile personale pentru tine și să eviți să le împărtășești online.<br/><br/>Evitați împărtășirea oricăror fotografii cu prietenii de chat online sau cu străinii.<br/><br/>Instalarea celei mai recente versiuni de antivirus pe sistemul dvs. vă poate oferi o linie bună de apărare împotriva amenințărilor de pe internet, cum ar fi virușii și programele malware.<br/><br/>Păstrarea de rezervă de date valoroase este o opţiune bună pentru a evita probleme cum ar fi contaminarea cu virus.<br/><br/>Evitați trimiterea informațiilor cardului de credit către site-uri care nu sunt securizate și nu au niciun certificat valabil.<br/><br/>Instalarea unui program de securitate care vă oferă controlul asupra cookie-urilor site-ului și vă salvează de la a fi urmărit de site-uri web.<br/><br/>Punerea dispozitivelor de detectare a intruziunilor bazate pe gazdă pe servere vă va ajuta să urmăriți neregulile din traficul site-ului dvs.<br/><br/>Se recomandă utilizarea firewall-ului.<br/><br/>De ce atacurile cibernetice sunt atât de populare?<br/><br/>Mai ieftin decât metodele tradiționale de înșelăciune<br/><br/>Urmărirea infracțiunilor cibernetice nu este ușoară<br/><br/>Locațiile exacte nu pot fi urmărite cu ușurință<br/><br/>Absența barierei fizice în lumea internetului<br/><br/>Infracțiunile cibernetice afectează un număr mare de oameni<br/><br/>Concluzie<br/><br/>Faptul că mintea umană are o putere insondabilă este de netăgăduit, motiv pentru care infracțiunile pe internet cresc într-un ritm enorm. Chiar și istoria a asistat la unele dintre cele mai mari de securitate pe internet a căzut de mâinile hackerilor, care au scăpat cu ușurință prea. Singura modalitate de a opri astfel de infracțiuni este să rămânem conștienți de legile cibernetice pe care le avem astăzi, care pot fi fie prin internet, fie prin intermediul furnizorilor de site-uri web / IT. Legea privind tehnologia informației trebuie să fie echilibrată în așa fel încât să se dovedească prea strictă pentru persoanele care sunt implicate în infracțiuni cibernetice și, în același timp, să nu împiedice niciodată creșterea industriei internetului.<br/><br/>Autor Bio:– Maneet Puri conduce în prezent o firmă de design web de calitate situată în New Delhi, India.
