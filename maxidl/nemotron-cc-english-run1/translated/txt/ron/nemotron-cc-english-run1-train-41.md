| Bacopa<br/><br/>19 Nov 2015<br/>Posted by Doxiderol<br/><br/>Bacopa is a perennial plant that thrives in marshy subtropical and tropical regions around the globe. The highly regarded herb is a key ingredient in Doxiderol, a nutritional supplement that enhances cognitive function. Bacopa was chosen for its ability to protect the brain and increase acetylcholine, a biochemical messenger that enables the nervous system to relay information.<br/><br/>Ayurvedic practitioners first described the therapeutic properties of bacopa in 300 BC. The physicians recorded bacopa's abilities to enhance intelligence and memory. Nearly 2,500 years later, a growing body of modern research confirms the cognitive benefits of bacopa recorded in the Ayurvedic text.<br/><br/>In 1987, researchers in India evaluated the effects of bacopa on the intellectual function of school-aged children. During the four-week study, they administered bacopa to 40 children who were 6 to 8 years old. The scientists determined that bacopa increased perception and memory. The children were able to solve maze exercises quicker and more accurately after receiving bacopa. Many parents in India routinely use bacopa to enhance their children's intellectual development.<br/><br/>A 12-week study published in the August 2001 issue of Psychopharmacology investigated the effects of bacopa on cognitive function. Scientists randomly assigned the healthy volunteers, aged 18 to 65, to receive bacopa or an inactive substance. They also used a double-blind configuration for the study to conceal the identities of the products. Researchers use this design to ensure that the test results are valid because it eliminates bias by the researchers and participants. The bacopa group experienced a significant improvement in the speed at which they were able to process visual information. The participants also learned faster and stored new memories more efficiently.<br/><br/>In 2007, a Texas A&M College of Medicine laboratory study revealed one of the mechanisms responsible for bacopa's ability to promote brain health. According to the scientists, bacopa uses polyphenols to prevent oxidative stress and the damage that it causes to healthy brain cells. Bacopa also reduces harmful deposits of a substance known as beta-amyloid, which is the primary component of the plaque in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease.<br/><br/>A double-blind study published in the July 2008 issue of the Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine evaluated the effect of bacopa on elderly patients. The study confirmed that bacopa increased cognitive performance while reducing stress. According to the authors, the benefits achieved in this study confirmed the results of earlier research.<br/><br/>A 90-day study published in the December 2008 issue of Phytotherapy Research confirms the cognitive benefits that were previously demonstrated in other bacopa studies. Bacopa significantly improved the ability of the participants to temporarily store and use information required for completing a complex task. The double-blind study also demonstrated that bacopa reduced the time required to process visual information.<br/><br/>In addition to enhancing nerve signal transmission, the scientists theorize that bacopa increases cognitive function by reducing anxiety. Numerous studies indicate that anxiety interferes with the ability to perform tasks that require higher-level cognitive functions, such as learning and memorization. Stress disrupts biochemical messengers and healthy nerve signal transmission. Bacopa alleviates stress and restores a sense of calm by increasing acetylcholine levels, which reduces your heart rate and enables you to take deeper breaths.<br/><br/>Doxiderol is a great way to obtain the benefits of bacopa. This holistic supplement also contains other natural ingredients that promote brain health and support your ability to focus and concentrate on complex task as well as memorize information. | Bacopa<br/><br/>19 Noiembrie 2015<br/>Postat de Doxiderol<br/><br/>Bacopa este o plantă perenă care prosperă în regiunile subtropicale și tropicale mlaștinoase din întreaga lume. Planta foarte apreciată este un ingredient cheie în Doxiderol, un supliment nutritiv care îmbunătățește funcția cognitivă. Bacopa a fost aleasă pentru capacitatea sa de a proteja creierul și de a crește acetilcolina, un mesager biochimic care permite sistemului nervos să transmită informații.<br/><br/>Practicanții ayurvedici au descris pentru prima dată proprietățile terapeutice ale bacopei în 300 î.Hr. Medicii au înregistrat abilitățile bacopei de a spori inteligența și memoria. Aproape 2.500 de ani mai târziu, un număr tot mai mare de cercetări moderne confirmă beneficiile cognitive ale bacopei înregistrate în textul ayurvedic.<br/><br/>În 1987, cercetătorii din India au evaluat efectele bacopa asupra funcției intelectuale a copiilor de vârstă școlară. În timpul studiului de patru săptămâni, au administrat bacopa la 40 de copii cu vârsta cuprinsă între 6 și 8 ani. Oamenii de știință au stabilit că bacopa a crescut percepția și memoria. Copiii au fost capabili să rezolve exercițiile labirint mai repede și mai precis după ce au primit bacopa. Mulți părinți din India folosesc în mod obișnuit bacopa pentru a spori dezvoltarea intelectuală a copiilor lor.<br/><br/>Un studiu de 12 săptămâni publicat în numărul din august 2001 al revistei Psychopharmacology a investigat efectele bacopei asupra funcției cognitive. Oamenii de știință au repartizat aleatoriu voluntarii sănătoși, cu vârste cuprinse între 18 și 65 de ani, pentru a primi bacopa sau o substanță inactivă. Ei au folosit, de asemenea, o configurație dublu-orb pentru studiul pentru a ascunde identitățile produselor. Cercetătorii folosesc acest design pentru a se asigura că rezultatele testelor sunt valide, deoarece elimină prejudecățile cercetătorilor și participanților. Grupul bacopa a înregistrat o îmbunătățire semnificativă a vitezei la care au fost capabili să proceseze informațiile vizuale. Participanții au învățat mai repede și au stocat noi amintiri mai eficient.<br/><br/>În 2007, un studiu de laborator al Texas A & M College of Medicine a dezvăluit unul dintre mecanismele responsabile pentru capacitatea bacopa de a promova sănătatea creierului. Potrivit oamenilor de știință, bacopa folosește polifenoli pentru a preveni stresul oxidativ și daunele pe care le provoacă celulelor creierului sănătoase. Bacopa reduce, de asemenea, depozitele dăunătoare ale unei substanțe cunoscute sub numele de beta-amiloid, care este componenta primară a plăcii din creierul pacienților cu boala Alzheimer.<br/><br/>Un studiu dublu-orb publicat în numărul din iulie 2008 al Jurnalului de Medicină Alternativă și Complementară a evaluat efectul bacopa asupra pacienților vârstnici. Studiul a confirmat că bacopa a crescut performanța cognitivă, reducând în același timp stresul. Potrivit autorilor, beneficiile obținute în acest studiu au confirmat rezultatele cercetărilor anterioare.<br/><br/>Un studiu de 90 de zile publicat în numărul din decembrie 2008 al Phytotherapy Research confirmă beneficiile cognitive care au fost demonstrate anterior în alte studii bacopa. Bacopa a îmbunătățit semnificativ capacitatea participanților de a stoca și utiliza temporar informațiile necesare pentru a finaliza o sarcină complexă. Studiul dublu-orb a demonstrat, de asemenea, că bacopa a redus timpul necesar procesării informațiilor vizuale.<br/><br/>În plus față de îmbunătățirea transmisiei semnalelor nervoase, oamenii de știință teoretizează că bacopa crește funcția cognitivă prin reducerea anxietății. Numeroase studii indică faptul că anxietatea interferează cu capacitatea de a efectua sarcini care necesită funcții cognitive de nivel superior, cum ar fi învățarea și memorarea. Stresul perturbă mesagerii biochimici și transmiterea sănătoasă a semnalelor nervoase. Bacopa ameliorează stresul și restabilește un sentiment de calm prin creșterea nivelului de acetilcolină, ceea ce reduce ritmul cardiac și vă permite să respirați mai adânc.<br/><br/>Doxiderol este o modalitate excelentă de a obține beneficiile bacopa. Acest supliment holistic conține, de asemenea, alte ingrediente naturale care promovează sănătatea creierului și vă sprijină capacitatea de a vă concentra și de a vă concentra asupra sarcinii complexe, precum și de a memora informații. |

She can also sense demonic auras as well as evil auras. When she was born and growing, however, her powers were sealed and she was much less powerful. Since the defeat of the one sealing her powers, Kagome has reached her full potential.<br/><br/>PURIFICATION By making a physical connection, Kagome has the ability to purify both poison and darkness from a subject (living and inanimate). To do so, she projects her spiritual powers through her hand.<br/><br/>SPIRITUAL BARRIERS With her full potential, Kagome has the ability to create a barrier around herself and expand it around others. It is a dome-shaped barrier that can destroy weak demons that make contact with the barrier.<br/><br/>IMPROVED EYESIGHT<br/>Kagome has the ability to see things that are often invisible to the human eye: ghosts, spirits, divine and evil auras.<br/><br/>ABILITIES WITH WEAPONS<br/>Kagome has the ability to use a bow and arrow. She has been self trained, and after years of practice, her arrow rarely misses its mark. Alongside this, Kagome has the ability to infuse her arrows with powers. She can infuse an arrows with her spiritual powers which allows them to penetrate demonic forces, destroy spells, and purify objects. She can infuse her bow with her powers and deflect enemy attacks. She has the ability to infuse her arrows with purifying energy to purify poison as well as powerful, long distant demonic attacks. And, finally, she has the ability to bypass others with her arrow: If her target happens to be behind a barrier or a hostage, the arrow can teleport and hit only her target<br/><br/>The rest of her abilities have become rather unimportant as they are related to time travel (through the Bone Eater's Well), the Shikon Jewel, or her previous incarnation.<br/><br/>the canon<br/><br/>Kagome has been pulled a few days after her high school graduation, however, before the Bone Eater's Well has opened again to allow her to return to the past permanently.<br/><br/>freestyle<br/><br/>memories<br/><br/>かごめ<br/><br/>The sound of her name was a soft whisper in the back of her mind, like a call muffled by the wind. It was the sound of a distant memory, a voice that she had started to forget but desperately clung to all the same. It was her mother's voice, twisted in the sorrow of her lost daughter. Afterall, Kagome banished without a trace. She vividly remembered those moments, the way the day had begun, what she had for breakfast and the last thing she had said to her mother. It was haunting, those memories, because it was like any other time she had slipped between worlds. She had woken, listless, because she had no purpose outside of school. She could find a job, and was scheduled for an interview that day. Her heart hadn't been in it, but it was what she needed to do.<br/><br/>She remembered the feeling of dread, sucking it up and giving herself a pep talk that she could do this. That she could progress in the life that she was meant to now that things had been settled in the past. Of course, she had the lingering feeling that she no longer belonged in her own time or her own life. Not with everything that she had left behind.<br/><br/>Kagome remembered the feeling of the wood beneath her fingers, the way her hand had curled into the handle to slide the door open. She remembered that she paused, turning to her mother with a bright and vibrant smile as she shook herself from her stupor. "I'm taking off." She remembered how strong her voice sounded, the smile on her mother's lips as her eyes shone with pride. Her mother bade her farewell, which didn't seem any different than before but somehow the weight of the words settled in heavier on Kagome's shoulders the more she reflected.<br/><br/>Briefly, the thoughts flickered forward, wondering if her mother worried over her, missed her like she did. Kagome could openly admit that her mother's strength, her support for the fact that her daughter slipped through time so frequently. There were times when she thought herself weak for not having the woman to lean on.<br/><br/>However, she remembered that she did muster up a meager amount of strength.She could remember the shift in the air, the temperature notably different than what she had expected, blinking at the sudden and unfamiliar surroundings. It was not her family's shrine. And when she turned to go back, to slip through the door she had come through, she was met with unfamiliar and cold metal beneath her fingertips and an interior that was not the entrance of her house. A man stood before her, behind a counter, who stared at her with eyes as wide as her own.<br/><br/>She didn't panic, at least. Being torn through time and placed in impossible situations at least built your willpower as far as strange happenings went. Because it wasn't every day that someone found themselves dragged into the past by a demon, intent on ripping a powerful jewel from their body that they didn't even know was there. And then there was the fact that she had shattered said powerful jewel into who knows how many pieces and was tasked on finding them. Such things were not normal, and she had needed to square up and roll with it once she realized that was her reality. It had seemed so simple, just gather the shards and fix the jewel.<br/><br/>But it hadn't been easy, there were many demons after the shards and the jewel itself. And one particularly powerful demon with a wish that he was determined to see fulfilled. To this day, she had never learned his wish but knew it had never been granted even once he had the blasted thing completed. He had ruined so many lives for the sake of nothing. Ruined so many lives for such a futile task. Naraku had been the most difficult foe, and the one who had been the center of everything that had gone wrong in all of her friend's lives.<br/><br/>But, it was that unpredicability, that necessity to roll with what was happening and the willpower that she had gained from her adventure that she remembered drawing upon to come up with a story that fit in the moment that didn't seem too whimsical or far fetched. She needed to be believed, she needed to survive.<br/><br/>Afterall, she faced worse than a man in a camera store. She had lied through her teeth to save her life before.<br/><br/>"I was looking for a job." In the end, it wasn't a complete lie. After all, she had set out of her house with the intent of attending a job interview. Her state of dress would at least attest to that much. It was one of the easier fibs she had ever told.<br/><br/>And, for some reason, that crazy man hired her.<br/><br/>かごめ<br/><br/>Kagomed rolled over in her bed as she pushed back the distant memories, refusing to acknowledge that she was really awake. She clawed at the last glimpses of sleep, begging it to return and to take her back into its embrace. She closed her eyes, willing sleep to come and was only met with memories. The echoes of a song sang in the distance of her memories, a song that had often tormented her, given the same name as her. The voice that sang was no longer reminiscent of her mother, but the voices of children who she had often played with growing up. They called back the memories, even though it had been years since she started this live, even though she was happy in this life, the call of these memories was too loud.<br/><br/>Suddenly, she was falling back into them and sleep evaded her again. She was watching herself in her family's embrace while Inuyasha was pulled back into the well, looking as startled as she had felt. The memories of that moment, those feelings, were still so strong. The feeling of heartbreak and sorrow welled up again though it had been so long since she had felt like she had been ripped away from everything that mattered to her.<br/><br/>Of course her family mattered, and she was happy to be in their arms again. She could never fully, truly describe how she had felt in those days. She still couldn't explain the way she felt split in two, with warring desires to be in both her past and present. She remembered the futile attempts to jump through the well, fingers clawing at the ground in a desperate plea to let her return. The first month home, she didn't sleep so much as she cried.<br/><br/>Elysion had garnished a similar reaction, though it was not so fierce because she didn't know exactly where she had slipped through nor did she know where she could worm her way back. Her explorations were subtle between working her job and trying to settle herself into this life. She had no intentions of staying, no intentions of lingering longer than she needed. And while she didn't try as fiercely as she had when she tried to return to the past, her passion was tenfold because she had no ties to this world. Because she was truly alone… With no hope of anyone to reach her.<br/><br/>In her irrational moments, she thought the Jewel had pulled her back and found a new hell for her to reside in. A new hell that would force her to make a wish, but she remembered very clearly that she had wished it gone forever. That didn't stop her dreams, the times when she woke up in the night sobbing. And those memories of her past were the hardest to deal with, the hardest to forget. Her heart began to race in a panic as she turned in her bed again, her breath became a struggle as she fought against a panic attack induced by her wandering mind this late into the night.<br/><br/>She hated feeling so weak, so afraid.<br/><br/>籠の中の鳥は<br/><br/>Kagome finally pulled herself from bed, her room lit with a pale light that was enough to guide her to the bathroom. She stood before the mirror, the sink running while she stared at her reflection. Raven colored hair covered her face and she felt as bad as she looked. Her first morning in Elysion was similar to this, only she was in worse shape.<br/><br/>She had found a place to sleep, managing to work out a deal with the owner of the building to allow her to stay a small period of time without paying. Perhaps it had been Miroku's influence that allowed her to strike such deals, as the monk was known for his way in charming (or scamming) people into giving them more than enough for the work they had done. The monk had always been that way, since they had first met. He would claim the dwelling of a lord to be haunted when it was not or, claim that they were subject to an attack when they would not be. He would sell his wards and charms for such high prices. It worked practically every time and she wondered why people had been so willing to trust him.<br/><br/>Perhaps it was his smile, or the fact that he was a monk that the people of the past were so willing to crumble. He never preyed on the weak, at least. He always did what was right and he was a symbol of strength to her at times when he would push through everything in order to do what was right. He pushed through the fact that he was dying, that he was cursed, and tried to do something about it rather than wallowing in his fate. He had pushed himself to the limit in the time leading up to their final fight. And she had been glad that they had defeated Naraku before he could become subject to the same fate as his father, and his father before him.<br/><br/>As far as her own charms went, however, she was more fair than her friend and made the deal reasonable. She doubted that anyone in this world would pay a hefty price for an exorcism or banishing demons. They were too technologically advanced for that. But she was clever enough, and smart enough, to make a good deal.<br/><br/>But now, Kagome was in a better place though the look on her face looked the same. Haunted, tired, drained...<br/><br/>A quick glance at a clock on the wall told her that she could try to sleep longer. But she opted out of that, not wanting to face the flashbacks again. She took a shower instead, using the cold water to chase away her demons, to fill her lungs with a sharp intake of breath and force herself awake.<br/><br/>いついつ出やる<br/><br/>It didn't work.<br/><br/>Not in the way she was wanting. The cold water certainly forced the air into her lungs, forced her mind to wake and muscles to seize. A bitter laugh was pulled from her lips as she tilted her head back and found herself remembering more. Today, she wasn't going to escape them so easily. She wasn't going to recover so simply, to recover just because she willed it.<br/><br/>Sometimes, there's no avoiding the thoughts you wanted to. Even when you were certain that you were past them.<br/><br/>Sango would have been a great help in this situation. The demon slayer was her best friend, she would even go as far as to call her the sister that she never had. An older sister who was wise, always had her side when trouble arose. Particularly boy trouble, when such things were rather trivial but it was fun to have a crush and for her friend to be mad on her behalf when Inuyasha made her sad. After all, it had been often that the half-demon would run to his dead lover's side and break her heart more than once.<br/><br/>But, Sango also inspired her in other ways. After all the woman had faced, she had always been so strong, so sure... Even in the times that she had doubted herself, she always pulled through. She admired that she had the ability to survive after losing her whole family -- the reminder of this often pushed Kagome to survive, because she lost everyone to this world -- and then having her brother become a pawn of Naraku. It wasn't easy, couldn't have been something to that just anyone could face and still go forward with. She still smiled, even with that pain and those reminders... She was often so bright, even in the darker times.<br/><br/>And right now, she wanted to lean into the older woman's side, to take comfort in the fact that she was there and she was supportive. She felt that Sango would somehow pull through this, and offer some words of strength and understanding. It was times like these that made these spells worse, the constant reminder that she was without her family.<br/><br/>"I don't want to be alone." She cried aloud in her solitude, the sound of the shower drowning out the plea.<br/><br/>She wasn't afraid to admit it.<br/><br/>夜明けの晩に<br/><br/>Another hour had slipped by before she had realized it. Her skin was cold from the water and it felt like ice ran through her veins. She hadn't realized she had begun to shiver until her hand reached to turn off the water and end her shower. Kagome didn't seek her own gaze in the mirror again, instead, she wrapped herself in towels and trudged out of the bathroom, up the stairs and into her kitchen. She started on making a light breakfast, idly reading through her notes for the day as the food cooked.<br/><br/>Her career was really taking off these last years. Her photos were featured in many galleries, her name started to frequent many lips for those who were interested in photography.<br/><br/>The job she had asked for on a whim had sparked it all. She had been far more lucky than she had expected to be in this world. Never lucky enough to slip back through the cracks into her own world, but lucky enough to do well. As she turned back to the stove, she remembered the time she had finally given up on returning home. It was about two years into her life here, as she had started to venture into photography as more than just a hobby but something she could make a name for herself with.<br/><br/>That day had been particularly pleasant, the sun was high in the sky and she had found herself taking some photos of the natural scenery. A little boy had hidden in one of the plants, and she had caught a picture of the moment his face had settled into a cheerful, mischievous grin the moment before he had jumped out to startle his prey. It reminded her of Shippou, the little kitsune she had, essentially, adopted. He, too, had been torn from his family when they had first met. His father killed and he was determined to avenge him. While young, he did seem so mature in their first encounters.<br/><br/>Maybe it had been the influence of Inuyasha that allowed the kit to act like a kid again, to be young and whimsical at times while others he was more mature. He offered comfort to her in his own way, and she tried to care for him as she would her own though she had been so young then as well. However, her youth did not stop her from understanding how to tend to him or care for him like her child. Her heart swelled when he smiled, when he had been so happy for his gift of crayons and took the time to make art. She was so proud of each drawing that he had finished that she knew that this was how a mother would feel in such a situation.<br/><br/>The pain that had ripped through her was too much, too sudden. She missed him and wanted to see how much he had grown since she had been gone. She had missed so much...<br/><br/>To spare herself any further pain, any false hopes… She gave up. And focused on bettering herself.<br/><br/>鶴と亀が<br/><br/>Breakfast tasted bland, boring, and inspired. Only after she had finished did she realized she had forgotten to any sort of spices or flavor to the food. It was too late now to remember that much, as her mind was too busy remembering other details of her life that clearly had become more important than her food.<br/><br/>"Sit!"<br/><br/>Of course, nothing happened when she had angrily yelled at one particularly frustrating client that reminded her of the half-demon. He was being particularly stubborn and rude, wanting a photo taken his way rather than letting it work out naturally. You could try to force wild animals to behave how you wanted. But, rarely did anyone succeed with force. Inuyasha wasn't as bad, however. Inuyasha had learned before she had been forced away from him. He had become gentler, more understanding, more mature though there were times he was still childish and cocky.<br/><br/>She remember how red her cheeks had burned, but how she stood her ground and fired him. She told him she refused to work for anyone or with anyone who wanted to twist something beyond it's nature, beyond it's own desires.<br/><br/>She should have compared the man to Naraku rather than Inuyasha. Though her client did not have such extreme intentions. At least the feeling afterwards was a pleasant memory. The freedom of knowing that she had come so far that she could refuse work that she didn't want to do, to be her own person that was independent of others. She could say that she made it at that point. Even though she heard rumors days later with words meant to slander her.<br/><br/>She defended herself righteously, like she did towards the end of her journey. After all, she was the only one who could protect herself in this world.<br/><br/>滑った<br/><br/>Morning light began to creep into her home, reminding her again of the passage of time. Again, she considered the list of things she had to do and debated on where to start. Or, if she should even start at all. With how the day began, she didn't know if she could consider that a great idea. It was doubtful that she would be successful with how lost in herself she was becoming.<br/><br/>She didn't want to mess up her latest work. Because she had done that on a few occasions before. It wasn't pleasant to try and recover from a complete disaster.<br/><br/>Kagome remembered the feeling of her expensive, brand new, camera slipping from her hands. She wasn't prepared to support it, because she had just removed it from her bag. Part of her screamed on the inside. A dramatic, over-the-top, full on scream that she frequently did when she was much, much younger. When she was struggling to make it through middle school while hopping between times. The other part of her had remained frozen in place while her lense completely shattered and the rest of the camera had broken along with it.<br/><br/>Seeing Inuyasha's brother, a full demon, standing before her was the last thing she expected when she had made her way out for her photos. He stood as proud as ever, as tall as ever, as imposing as she remembered. He didn't look fazed at all to be in an entirely different world, though she was never the best at reading his mind. His name on her lips was so potent, that she could remember the tiniest feelings as she did. Her lips were chapped, her mouth felt dry, and the bubbling feeling of anxiety in her stomach made her feel sick.<br/><br/>She didn't want her hopes to be up.<br/><br/>But, she wanted him to be there, even if they were not friends. They were allies, if anything, since they had fought side by side. And something was better than absolutely nothing.<br/><br/>And Kagome had the sense enough not to throw herself at him, to wrap her arms around him in relief that knowing she was not alone. Her camera no longer mattered when she approached him. She remembered that nothing else mattered for days as she spent time with him, not speaking of their world but speaking (or, she was speaking and he simply acknowledged that fact).<br/><br/>When, exactly, she fell for him though… Kagome couldn't recall. It was a subtle thing, just like he was. But she knew the feeling was there. And he let her know that she was not alone in the fact that she had fallen, that feelings had somehow blossomed.<br/><br/>後ろの正面<br/><br/>A feeling of weightlessness overtook her and suddenly her eyes opened while her mind desperately clawed for the last thing she was doing. She didn't recall when she had fallen asleep on her couch, but she knew the last place she had been was on the far too comfortable cushions. She didn't struggle, however, or fight the weightlessness as she was in familiar arms. Her head tilted against Sesshoumaru's chest, taking comfort in the fact that he was here and she wasn't alone.<br/><br/>"Welcome back." His response was a soft hum in acknowledgement. He didn't need to speak much for her to understand his intent, or the rest of what he had to say.<br/><br/>He carried her back to her bed, settled her into it with ease. Her eyes met his and she smiled easily because no more memories drifted back, no more recollections teased at her. No, whenever he was near, she never fell back into those thoughts. He had helped, and the years had helped. Today was just… One of those days.<br/><br/>"Sleep." He commanded with ease, her eyes rolled at him but she did not fight because she was tired. Her hand clung tightly to him, while she felt his opposite hand press to her forehead in assessment of her wellbeing.<br/><br/>"I'm okay," she said, her words firm with her promise.<br/><br/>She was okay. She was alive. And she was happy.<br/><br/>だあれ<br/><br/>shipper<br/><br/>summary<br/><br/>Kagome, at one point in her life, was a rather regular teenage girl until she was attacked by a demon inside her family's well house. The demon dragged her down into the well, which magically transported her about 500 years into the past. There, she learned that a sacred jewel was encased inside her body as she was the reincarnation of a priestess that had died 50 years prior to the time she was dragged into. The jewel was ripped from her body and the demon that dragged her through time was defeated by the half-demon that she freed who was pinned to the tree. Kagome befriended the half-demon, Inuyasha, in time and traveled with him to restore the jewel that she, herself, shattered. Though it was not so straightforward and easy to do as many demons and humans sought the jewel for their own purposes. She befriended a young kitsune demon, a monk, and a demon slayer who all traveled with her to restore the jewel.<br/><br/>Her group, however, was not the one to complete the jewel. Instead, an evil half-demon who manipulated the majority of the major events in most of her companion's lives. When he finally collected all the pieces of the jewel and made his wish on the tainted object, Kagome was drawn into the jewel itself with the intent of her making a selfish wish to keep her trapped inside forever, keeping the jewel alive. It was the stubbornness of Inuyasha that managed to save her from the darkness. In the end, she returned to her natural time, finished high school as was expect from a girl of her timeline. Though days later, Kagome ended up in Elysion. She has been in this world for five years, and has long since given up on returning home. She's settled happily into her new life.<br/><br/>platonic<br/><br/>It's rather easy for Kagome to make new friends, she hasn't changed much from her youth. She is a cheerful young woman who is empathetic and welcoming to most of all in her life. In her youth, she befriended demons when most would fear them. Even demons that used to eat humans, she has befriended and she changed their ways (she'd like to think). This being said, it's really easy to become her friend as long as someone is able to shown that they are willing to be redeemed, or show that they are not completely evil. She feels greatly for everyone she meets, so it's hard for her not to be drawn to others in a desire to be friends.<br/><br/>antagonistic<br/><br/>The only way to earn Kagome's wrath is to be so deplorable, so evil, and so far beyond redemption that she can't see any good in you. And she can see the good in pretty much everyone and everything. Honestly, with whom she has faced? A half-demon that pitted two lovers against each other, that cursed the entire male line of one of her friends, and then had her best friend's brother kill their family… Yeah, I don't see her hating anyone without them really, really working for it. Feel free to give it a shot, though.<br/><br/>romantic<br/><br/>When in love, Kagome is a strong support, always staying there even when things may be rough. However, Kagome is not looking for love, wasn't looking for love when she arrived so any past relationships don't exist. This isn't to say that someone hasn't fallen in love with her. She can definitely be the subject of someone's unrequited love, she'll probably be oblivious about it, though. Finally, Kagome is currently engaged to Sesshoumaru, surprisingly. I'm totally open to potential AU things, though. <3<br/><br/>fandom hell<br/><br/>age ancient<br/><br/>species space queen<br/><br/>occupation dying<br/><br/>prefers she/her<br/><br/>awards<br/><br/>pro<br/>she/her est 62woo i suck at plot replies. but ok anyway!!! neptune is very friendly and has that 'cool' persona, he's really fun to be around, and he's SUPER good to work with. like he's super patient and he'll do anything she asks of him--he's really easy to work with, definitely in comparison to other models. so i love the idea of them being all work oriented friends at first and then turning into something more. neptune definitely tries to surround himself with people, because he loves having friends, and kagome is pretty much his type too? like she's sweet and she's a strong woman, and he is actually better friends with women than he is with men, idk why, he just loves being surrounded by female friends who knows. i love my guys being super good friends and protecting their girl friends honestly. but oh M A N i love pseduo-family type relationships and neptune is an only child, so he hasn't had any like, familial relationships like that. so her looking out for him all big sister like would make him be like ????? cause he's confused but also he actually really likes that LOL! they're both good kids, i think they'd be really fun ^^<br/><br/>fandom fire emblem: fates<br/><br/>age ninteen<br/><br/>species Part human / part dragon<br/><br/>occupation representative guardian<br/><br/>prefers she/her<br/><br/>awards<br/><br/>yonder<br/>she/her aest 20 posts<br/><br/>I haven't seen Inuyasha at all but... from what I've read Kagome seems to be one of those people who might be able to help Corrin out with her emotional state. There's a lot weighing on her mind since she had to fight her birth family against her will and last time she saw them they all pretty much hated her. Frankly she hasn't worked through everything yet since she was essentially at the head of a full-scale war.

I love your idea of Kagome taking a pic of Elsa! You know, she's also a singer/performer at a local theater so I can imagine Kagome going there to scope things out and then catching Elsa backstage or something--and then the friendship could blossom from there!

De asemenea, poate simți aure demonice, precum și aure rele. Când s-a născut și a crescut, totuși, puterile ei au fost sigilate și ea a fost mult mai puțin puternică. De la înfrângerea celui care și-a sigilat puterile, Kagome și-a atins întregul potențial.<br/><br/>PURIFICARE Prin realizarea unei conexiuni fizice, Kagome are capacitatea de a purifica atât otrava, cât și întunericul de la un subiect (viu și neînsuflețit). Pentru a face acest lucru, ea își proiectează puterile spirituale prin mâna ei.<br/><br/>Cu întregul ei potențial, Kagome are capacitatea de a crea o barieră în jurul ei și de a o extinde în jurul altora. Este o barieră în formă de cupolă care poate distruge demonii slabi care fac contact cu bariera.<br/><br/>ÎMBUNĂTĂȚIREA OCHILOR<br/>Kagome are capacitatea de a vedea lucruri care sunt adesea invizibile pentru ochiul uman: fantome, spirite, aure divine și rele.<br/><br/>Abilități cu arme<br/>Kagome are abilitatea de a folosi un arc și săgeată. Ea a fost auto-antrenat, și după ani de practică, săgeata ei rareori își pierde amprenta. Împreună cu aceasta, Kagome are abilitatea de a-și infuza săgețile cu puteri. Ea poate infuza o săgeată cu puterile ei spirituale, care le permite să pătrundă forțele demonice, distruge vrăji, și purifica obiectele. Ea poate infuza arcul cu puterile ei și devia atacurile inamice. Ea are capacitatea de a-și infuza săgețile cu energie purificatoare pentru a purifica otrava, precum și atacuri demonice puternice, de lungă durată. Și, în cele din urmă, ea are capacitatea de a ocoli pe alții cu săgeata ei: Dacă ținta ei se întâmplă să fie în spatele unei bariere sau a unui ostatic, săgeata se poate teleporta și poate lovi doar ținta ei.<br/><br/>Restul abilităților ei au devenit destul de neimportante, deoarece sunt legate de călătoria în timp (prin fântâna Mănâncătorului de Oase), bijuteria Shikon sau încarnarea ei anterioară.<br/><br/>Canonul<br/><br/>Kagome a fost retrasă la câteva zile după absolvirea liceului, cu toate acestea, înainte ca fântâna Mănâncătorului de Oase să se deschidă din nou pentru a-i permite să se întoarcă în trecut permanent.<br/><br/>Freestyle<br/><br/>Amintiri<br/><br/>かごめ<br/><br/>Sunetul numelui ei era o șoaptă moale în spatele minții ei, ca un apel înăbușit de vânt. Era sunetul unei amintiri îndepărtate, o voce pe care a început să o uite, dar cu disperare s-a agățat de toate la fel. A fost vocea mamei ei, răsucită în durerea fiicei ei pierdute. După toate, Kagome a izgonit fără urmă. Ea și-a amintit cu tărie acele momente, modul în care a început ziua, ceea ce a mâncat la micul dejun și ultimul lucru pe care i l-a spus mamei sale. A fost bântuitor, amintirile acelea, pentru că era ca în orice altă perioadă în care alunecase între lumi. Se trezise, nerăbdătoare, pentru că nu avea niciun scop în afara școlii. Putea să-și găsească un loc de muncă și era programată pentru un interviu în acea zi. Inima ei nu a fost în ea, dar a fost ceea ce ea a trebuit să facă.<br/><br/>Și-a amintit de sentimentul de groază, sugându-l și dându-și o discuție de încurajare că ar putea face acest lucru. Că ar putea progresa în viața pe care a fost menită să o facă acum că lucrurile s-au rezolvat în trecut. Bineînţeles, ea avea sentimentul că nu mai aparţinea timpului ei sau vieţii ei, nu tot ceea ce lăsase în urmă.<br/><br/>Kagome şi-a amintit sentimentul lemnului de sub degetele ei, felul în care mâna ei s-a încurcat în mâner pentru a deschide uşa. Şi-a amintit că s-a oprit, întorcându-se spre mama ei cu un zâmbet strălucitor şi vibrant în timp ce se scutura de stupoarea ei. Și-a amintit cât de tare suna vocea ei, zâmbetul de pe buzele mamei sale, în timp ce ochii ei străluceau de mândrie. Mama ei i-a spus la revedere, ceea ce nu părea deloc diferit decât înainte, dar într-un fel greutatea cuvintelor s-a aşezat mai greu pe umerii lui Kagome cu atât mai mult ea reflecta.<br/><br/>Pe scurt, gândurile au pâlpâit înainte, întrebându-se dacă mama ei era îngrijorată pentru ea, îi era dor de ea așa cum a făcut-o. Kagome a putut recunoaște în mod deschis că puterea mamei ei, sprijinul ei pentru faptul că fiica ei aluneca prin timp atât de des. Au fost momente în care s-a crezut slabă pentru că nu a avut femeia pe care să se sprijine.<br/><br/>Cu toate acestea, și-a amintit că a adunat o cantitate mică de forță. Își putea aminti schimbarea în aer, temperatura deosebit de diferită de ceea ce se așteptase, clipind la mediul brusc și necunoscut. Nu era altarul familiei ei. Şi când s-a întors să se întoarcă, să strecoare prin uşa prin care intrase, s-a întâlnit cu metal necunoscut şi rece sub vârful degetelor şi cu un interior care nu era intrarea în casa ei. Un bărbat stătea în fața ei, în spatele unui tejghea, care se uita la ea cu ochii la fel de largi ca ai ei.<br/><br/>Cel puţin nu s-a panicat, fiind sfâşiată de timp şi plasată în situaţii imposibile, cel puţin ţi-ai construit voinţa în măsura în care se întâmplă lucruri ciudate. Pentru că nu în fiecare zi cineva s-a trezit târât în trecut de un demon, cu intenția de a rupe o bijuterie puternică din corpul lor, pe care nici măcar nu știau că era acolo. Și apoi a fost faptul că ea a spart bijuteria puternică în cine știe câte bucăți și a fost însărcinată să le găsească. Astfel de lucruri nu erau normale, și ea a trebuit să pătrundă și să se rostogolească cu ea odată ce și-a dat seama că era realitatea ei. Părea atât de simplu, doar adunați cioburile și reparați bijuteria.<br/><br/>Dar nu a fost ușor, au fost mulți demoni după cioburi și bijuteria însăși. Și un demon deosebit de puternic cu o dorință pe care era hotărât să o vadă îndeplinită. Până în ziua de azi, ea nu a învățat niciodată dorința lui, dar știa că nu a fost niciodată acordată chiar și odată ce a terminat lucrul aruncat. El a distrus atât de multe vieți de dragul nimicului. A distrus atât de multe vieți pentru o sarcină atât de inutilă. Naraku a fost cel mai dificil dușman, și cel care a fost centrul a tot ceea ce a mers prost în toate viețile prietenului ei.<br/><br/>Dar, era acea imprevizibilitate, acea necesitate de a se învârti în jurul a ceea ce se întâmpla și voința pe care o câștigase din aventura ei pe care și-a amintit că a desenat să vină cu o poveste care se potrivea momentului care nu părea prea capricioasă sau prea căutată. Avea nevoie să fie crezută, avea nevoie să supraviețuiască.<br/><br/>La urma urmei, s-a confruntat cu o situaţie mai gravă decât cea a unui bărbat dintr-un magazin de aparate de fotografiat.<br/><br/>"Am fost în căutarea unui loc de muncă." În cele din urmă, nu a fost o minciună completă. La urma urmei, ea a plecat din casa ei cu intenția de a participa la un interviu de angajare. Starea ei de îmbrăcăminte ar atesta cel puțin atât de mult. A fost una dintre cele mai ușoare fibs ea a spus vreodată.<br/><br/>Și, pentru un motiv oarecare, că omul nebun a angajat-o.<br/><br/>かごめ<br/><br/>Kagomed s-a răsturnat în patul ei în timp ce împingea înapoi amintirile îndepărtate, refuzând să recunoască că era într-adevăr trează. S-a agățat de ultimele clipe de somn, implorând-o să se întoarcă și să o ia înapoi în îmbrățișarea ei. Închidea ochii, dornică să vină să doarmă şi nu se întâlnea decât cu amintiri. Ecourile unui cântec cântau în depărtare de amintirile ei, un cântec care de multe ori o chinuise, dându-i acelaşi nume. Vocea care cânta nu mai amintea de mama ei, ci de vocile copiilor cu care se jucase de multe ori în copilărie. Au reamintit amintirile, chiar dacă au trecut ani de când a început acest live, chiar dacă era fericită în această viață, chemarea acestor amintiri a fost prea tare.<br/><br/>Dintr-o dată, ea a căzut din nou în ei și somnul a scăpat din nou. Ea se uita în îmbrățișarea familiei ei în timp ce Inuyasha a fost tras înapoi în fântână, arătând la fel de uimit ca ea a simțit. Amintirile acelui moment, acele sentimente, erau încă atât de puternice. Sentimentul de durere și durere se revărsa din nou, deși a trecut atât de mult timp de când a simțit că a fost smulsă de tot ceea ce conta pentru ea.<br/><br/>Bineînțeles că familia ei contează și ea era fericită să fie din nou în brațele lor. Ea nu ar fi putut niciodată să descrie pe deplin, cu adevărat, cum se simțea în acele zile. Ea încă nu a putut explica modul în care se simțea împărțită în două, cu dorințele războinice de a fi atât în trecut cât și în prezent. Ea și-a amintit încercările inutile de a sări prin fântână, cu degetele ghemuite la pământ într-un apel disperat pentru a o lăsa să se întoarcă. În prima lună acasă, ea nu a dormit atât de mult pe cât a plâns.<br/><br/>Elysion a avut o reacție similară, deși nu a fost atât de feroce pentru că nu știa exact unde a alunecat și nici nu știa unde ar putea să se întoarcă. Explorarile ei au fost subtile intre munca ei si incercarea de a se aseza in aceasta viata. Ea nu a avut nici o intentie de a ramane, nici o intentie de a sta mai mult decat avea nevoie. Și în timp ce ea nu a încercat la fel de feroce ca atunci când a încercat să se întoarcă în trecut, pasiunea ei a fost de zece ori mai mare pentru că ea nu a avut nici o legătură cu această lume. Pentru că ea a fost cu adevărat singură ... cu nici o speranță de a ajunge la ea.<br/><br/>În momentele ei iraționale, ea a crezut că bijuteria a tras-o înapoi și a găsit un nou iad pentru ea să locuiască în. Un nou iad care ar forța-o să facă o dorință, dar ea și-a amintit foarte clar că ea a dorit să dispară pentru totdeauna. Asta nu i-a oprit visele, momentele în care se trezea în timpul nopţii plângând şi acele amintiri din trecutul ei erau cele mai greu de tratat, cele mai greu de uitat. Inima ei a început să alerge în panică în timp ce se întorcea din nou în patul ei, respirația ei a devenit o luptă în timp ce se lupta împotriva unui atac de panică indus de mintea ei rătăcitoare atât de târziu în noapte.<br/><br/>Nu-i plăcea să se simtă atât de slabă, atât de speriată.<br/><br/>籠の中の鳥は<br/><br/>Kagome s-a scos în cele din urmă din pat, camera ei s-a aprins cu o lumină palidă care a fost suficientă pentru a o ghida la baie. Ea stătea în fața oglinzii, chiuveta fugea în timp ce se uita la reflexia ei. Părul colorat al corbului i-a acoperit fața și ea s-a simțit la fel de rău cum arăta. Prima ei dimineață în Elysion a fost similară cu aceasta, doar că ea era într-o formă mai rea.<br/><br/>Găsese un loc unde să doarmă, reușind să ajungă la o înțelegere cu proprietarul clădirii pentru a-i permite să rămână o perioadă scurtă de timp fără să plătească. Poate că influența lui Miroku i-a permis să facă astfel de tranzacții, deoarece călugărul era cunoscut pentru modul său de a încânta (sau de a înșela) oamenii pentru a le oferi mai mult decât suficient pentru munca pe care o făcuseră. Călugărul a fost întotdeauna așa, de când s-au întâlnit prima dată. El ar pretinde locuința unui domn să fie bântuită atunci când nu era sau, pretinde că au fost supuși unui atac atunci când nu ar fi. El și-ar vinde sălile și farmecele la prețuri atât de mari. Funcționa practic de fiecare dată și se întreba de ce oamenii erau atât de dispuși să aibă încredere în el.<br/><br/>Poate a fost zâmbetul lui, sau faptul că el a fost un călugăr că oamenii din trecut au fost atât de dispuși să se prăbușească. El nu a prădat pe cei slabi, cel puțin. El a făcut întotdeauna ceea ce era corect și el a fost un simbol de putere pentru ea în momentele în care el a împins prin tot pentru a face ceea ce era corect. El a trecut prin faptul că era pe moarte, că era blestemat, și a încercat să facă ceva în acest sens, mai degrabă decât să se învârtă în soarta sa. El s-a împins la limita în timpul care a condus la lupta lor finală. Și ea se bucurase că l-au învins pe Naraku înainte ca el să poată fi supus aceluiași destin ca și tatăl său, și tatăl său înaintea lui.<br/><br/>În ceea ce privește farmecele ei, totuși, ea a fost mai dreaptă decât prietenul ei și a făcut afacerea rezonabilă. Ea se îndoia că cineva din această lume ar plăti un preț mare pentru o exorcizare sau alungarea demonilor. Ei erau prea avansați tehnologic pentru asta. Dar ea a fost destul de deşteaptă, şi destul de deşteaptă, pentru a face o afacere bună.<br/><br/>Dar acum, Kagome era într-un loc mai bun, deşi aspectul feţei ei arăta la fel.<br/><br/>O privire rapidă la un ceas de pe perete i-a spus că ar putea încerca să doarmă mai mult. Dar ea a optat pentru asta, nu dorind să se confrunte din nou cu flashback-urile. În schimb, ea a făcut un duș, folosind apa rece pentru a-și alunga demonii, pentru a-și umple plămânii cu o respirație ascuțită și a se forța să se trezească.<br/><br/>いついつ出やる<br/><br/>N-a mers.<br/><br/>Nu aşa cum îşi dorea ea. Apa rece a forţat cu siguranţă aerul în plămâni, a forţat mintea să se trezească şi muşchii să se prindă. Un râs amar a fost scos de pe buzele ei în timp ce îşi înclina capul înapoi şi s-a trezit amintindu-şi mai mult. Astăzi, ea nu a fost de gând să scape de ei atât de ușor. Ea nu a fost de gând să se recupereze atât de simplu, pentru a recupera doar pentru că ea a vrut.<br/><br/>Uneori, nu poţi evita gândurile pe care ţi le doreai, chiar şi atunci când erai sigur că le-ai depăşit.<br/><br/>Sango ar fi fost de mare ajutor în această situație. Ucigașul de demoni a fost cel mai bun prieten al ei, ea ar merge chiar până la a o numi sora pe care nu a avut-o niciodată. O soră mai mare, care a fost înțeleaptă, a avut întotdeauna partea ei atunci când au apărut probleme. Mai ales băieți probleme, atunci când astfel de lucruri au fost destul de banale, dar a fost distractiv să aibă o pasiune și pentru prietena ei să fie supărat pe ea atunci când Inuyasha a făcut-o trist. La urma urmei, a fost de multe ori că jumătate-demon a fugit la partea iubitului său mort și rupe inima ei de mai multe ori.<br/><br/>Dar Sango a inspirat-o şi pe ea în alte feluri. După ce femeia s-a confruntat cu toate acestea, ea a fost întotdeauna atât de puternică, atât de sigură... Chiar şi în vremurile în care se îndoiase de ea însăşi, ea s-a descurcat întotdeauna. Ea a admirat că ea a avut capacitatea de a supraviețui după ce și-a pierdut întreaga familie - amintirea acestui lucru l-a împins adesea pe Kagome să supraviețuiască, pentru că a pierdut pe toată lumea în această lume - și apoi fratele ei a devenit un pion al lui Naraku. Nu a fost ușor, nu ar fi putut fi ceva la care oricine să se poată confrunta și încă să meargă înainte. Ea încă zâmbea, chiar și cu acea durere și acele amintiri... Ea era adesea atât de strălucitoare, chiar și în vremurile mai întunecate.<br/><br/>Și chiar acum, ea a vrut să se aplece în partea femeii mai în vârstă, să se consoleze cu faptul că ea era acolo și ea a fost de sprijin. Ea a simțit că Sango ar face cumva acest lucru, și să ofere niște cuvinte de putere și înțelegere. Au fost momente ca acestea care au înrăutățit aceste vrăji, reamintirea constantă că ea era fără familia ei.<br/><br/>"Nu vreau să fiu singură." Ea a strigat cu voce tare în singurătatea ei, sunetul dușului înecând pledoaria.<br/><br/>Nu i-a fost frică să recunoască.<br/><br/>夜明けの晩に<br/><br/>Încă o oră alunecase înainte ca ea să-şi dea seama. Pielea ei era rece din apă şi se simţea ca şi cum gheaţa îi curgea prin vene. Nu-şi dăduse seama că începuse să tremure până când mâna ei a atins pentru a opri apa şi a termina duşul. Kagome nu şi-a căutat din nou propria privire în oglindă, ci s-a înfăşurat în prosoape şi a ieşit din baie, a urcat scările şi a intrat în bucătăria ei. A început să pregătească un mic dejun ușor, citind cu inactivitate notele pentru ziua respectivă, pe măsură ce mâncarea era gătită.<br/><br/>Cariera ei a fost într-adevăr decolare în ultimii ani. Fotografiile ei au fost prezentate în multe galerii, numele ei a început să frecventeze multe buze pentru cei care erau interesați de fotografie.<br/><br/>Munca pe care a cerut-o dintr-un capriciu a declanșat totul. Ea a fost mult mai norocoasă decât se așteptase să fie în această lume. Niciodată suficient de norocoasă să se strecoare înapoi prin fisuri în propria ei lume, dar destul de norocoasă să facă bine. În timp ce se întorcea la aragaz, își amintea de timpul pe care îl renunțase în sfârșit la întoarcerea acasă. Au trecut aproximativ doi ani din viața ei aici, deoarece a început să se aventureze în fotografie ca mai mult decât un simplu hobby, dar ceva cu care își putea face un nume.<br/><br/>Această zi a fost deosebit de plăcută, soarele era înalt pe cer și ea s-a trezit făcând niște fotografii ale peisajului natural. Un băiețel se ascunsese într-una dintre plante și ea prinsese o poză din momentul în care fața lui s-a așezat într-un zâmbet vesel, răutăcios, chiar înainte ca el sărise să-și sperie prada. I-a amintit de Shippou, micul kitsune pe care l-a adoptat, în esență. Și el a fost smuls din familia sa când s-au întâlnit prima dată. Tatăl său a ucis și el a fost hotărât să-l răzbune. De când era tânăr, părea atât de matur în primele lor întâlniri.<br/><br/>Poate că influența lui Inuyasha a permis kit-ului să se comporte din nou ca un copil, să fie tânăr și capricios uneori, în timp ce alții au fost mai maturi. El i-a oferit mângâiere în felul său, şi ea a încercat să aibă grijă de el ca şi cum ar fi avut grijă de ea, deşi şi ea fusese atât de tânără pe atunci. Cu toate acestea, tinereţea ei nu a împiedicat-o să înţeleagă cum să aibă grijă de el sau să aibă grijă de el ca de copilul ei. Inima ei s-a umflat când a zâmbit, când a fost atât de fericit pentru darul său de creioane și și-a luat timp să facă artă. Era atât de mândră de fiecare desen pe care îl terminase că știa că așa se va simți o mamă într-o astfel de situație.<br/><br/>Durerea care a izbucnit în ea a fost prea mult, prea brusc. Ea l-a lipsit și a vrut să vadă cât de mult a crescut de când a plecat. Ea a lipsit atât de mult...<br/><br/>Ca să se ferească de orice durere, de orice speranţă falsă, a renunţat şi s-a concentrat să se îmbunătăţească.<br/><br/>鶴と亀が<br/><br/>Micul dejun avea un gust moale, plictisitor și inspirat. Numai după ce a terminat și-a dat seama că a uitat de orice fel de condimente sau aromă la mâncare. Era prea târziu să-și amintească atât de mult, deoarece mintea ei era prea ocupată să-și amintească alte detalii ale vieții ei care deveniseră în mod clar mai importante decât mâncarea ei.<br/><br/>"Stai!"<br/><br/>Desigur, nimic nu s-a întâmplat când ea a strigat cu furie la un client deosebit de frustrant care i-a amintit de jumătate de demon. El a fost deosebit de încăpățânat și nepoliticos, dorind o fotografie făcută în felul său, mai degrabă decât să-l lase să funcționeze în mod natural. Ai putea încerca să forțezi animalele sălbatice să se comporte așa cum dorești. Dar, rareori cineva a reușit cu forța. Inuyasha nu a fost la fel de rău, totuși. Inuyasha a învățat înainte ca ea să fie forțată să plece de la el. El devenise mai blând, mai înţelegător, mai matur, deşi erau momente în care era încă copilăresc şi îngâmfat.<br/><br/>Își amintește cât de roșii îi ardeau obrajii, dar cum și-a ținut picioarele și l-a concediat. I-a spus că refuză să lucreze pentru oricine sau cu oricine care voia să răsucească ceva dincolo de natura sa, dincolo de propriile dorințe.<br/><br/>Ar fi trebuit să-l compare pe bărbat cu Naraku mai degrabă decât cu Inuyasha. Deși clientul ei nu avea intenții atât de extreme. Cel puțin sentimentul de după aceea a fost o amintire plăcută. Libertatea de a ști că a ajuns atât de departe încât a putut refuza o muncă pe care nu a vrut să o facă, să fie propria persoană care era independentă de ceilalți. Putea spune că a reușit în acel moment. Chiar dacă a auzit zvonuri zile mai târziu cu cuvinte menite să o calomnieze.<br/><br/>Ea s-a apărat cu dreptate, aşa cum a făcut-o spre sfârşitul călătoriei ei. La urma urmei, ea a fost singura care s-a putut apăra în această lume.<br/><br/>滑った<br/><br/>Lumina dimineții a început să se strecoare în casa ei, amintindu-i din nou de trecerea timpului. Din nou, ea a luat în considerare lista de lucruri pe care trebuia să le facă și a dezbătut de unde să înceapă. Sau, dacă ar trebui să înceapă chiar deloc. Cu modul în care a început ziua, ea nu știa dacă ar putea considera că o idee mare. Era îndoielnic că va avea succes cu cât de pierdută în ea a devenit.<br/><br/>N-a vrut să-şi strice ultima lucrare, pentru că făcuse asta de câteva ori înainte, nu a fost plăcut să încerce să-şi revină după un dezastru total.<br/><br/>Kagome și-a amintit sentimentul că aparatul de fotografiat aluneca din mâinile ei, scump și nou. Nu era pregătită să-l susțină, pentru că tocmai îl scosese din geantă. O parte din ea țipa pe dinăuntru. Un dramatic, over-the-top, plin de țipete pe care le făcea frecvent când era mult, mult mai tânără. Când se chinuia să treacă prin liceu în timp ce sărea între timp. Cealaltă parte a ei rămăsese înghețată, în timp ce lentila ei s-a rupt complet, iar restul camerei s-a rupt împreună cu ea.<br/><br/>Văzându-l pe fratele lui Inuyasha, un demon plin, stând în fața ei a fost ultimul lucru pe care ea l-a așteptat atunci când ea a făcut drumul ei pentru fotografiile ei. El a fost la fel de mândru ca niciodată, la fel de înalt ca niciodată, la fel de impunător ca și-a amintit. Nu părea deloc deranjat să se afle într-o lume cu totul diferită, deşi ea nu a fost niciodată cea mai bună cititoare a minţii sale. Numele lui pe buzele ei era atât de puternic, încât putea să-şi amintească cele mai mici sentimente ca şi ea. Buzele ei erau crăpate, gura îi era uscată, iar senzația de anxietate în stomac o făcea să se simtă rău.<br/><br/>Ea nu a vrut ca speranțele ei să fie ridicate.<br/><br/>Dar, ea a vrut ca el să fie acolo, chiar dacă ei nu erau prieteni. Ei au fost aliați, dacă ceva, deoarece au luptat unul lângă altul. Și ceva a fost mai bine decât absolut nimic.<br/><br/>Și Kagome a avut destulă înțelepciune să nu se arunce la el, să-și înfășoare brațele în jurul lui cu ușurare că știind că nu era singură. Camera ei nu mai conta atunci când se apropia de el. Ea și-a amintit că nimic altceva nu conta pentru zilele petrecute cu el, nu vorbind despre lumea lor, ci vorbind (sau, ea vorbea și el pur și simplu a recunoscut acest fapt).<br/><br/>Când, exact, s-a îndrăgostit de el... Kagome nu-şi putea aminti. Era un lucru subtil, aşa cum era el. Dar ea ştia că sentimentul era acolo. Şi el i-a spus că nu era singură în faptul că ea a căzut, că sentimentele au înflorit cumva.<br/><br/>後ろの正面<br/><br/>Un sentiment de lipsă de greutate a atins-o și, brusc, ochii i s-au deschis în timp ce mintea ei se chinuia disperată pentru ultimul lucru pe care îl făcea. Nu-și amintea când adormise pe canapeaua ei, dar știa că ultimul loc în care fusese era pe pernele prea confortabile. Ea nu s-a luptat, totuși, sau nu s-a luptat cu lipsa de greutate, deoarece era în brațe familiare. Capul ei s-a înclinat spre pieptul lui Sesshoumaru, mângâindu-se în faptul că el era aici și ea nu era singură.<br/><br/>"Bine ai revenit." Răspunsul său a fost un bubuit moale în recunoaştere. El nu a avut nevoie să vorbească mult pentru ea pentru a înţelege intenţia sa, sau restul a ceea ce a avut de spus.<br/><br/>El a dus-o înapoi în patul ei, a aşezat-o în el cu uşurinţă. Ochii ei l-au întâlnit pe al lui şi ea a zâmbit uşor, pentru că nu mai existau amintiri în derivă, nu mai existau amintiri tachinate la ea. Nu, ori de câte ori el era aproape, ea nu a mai căzut niciodată în acele gânduri. El a ajutat, şi anii au ajutat. Astăzi a fost doar... una din acele zile.<br/><br/>"Somnul." El a poruncit cu ușurință, ochii ei s-au rostogolit spre el, dar ea nu a luptat pentru că era obosită. Mâna ei s-a agățat strâns de el, în timp ce ea a simțit presiunea mâinii opuse pe fruntea ei în evaluarea bunăstării ei.<br/><br/>"Sunt bine", a spus ea, cuvintele ei ferm cu promisiunea ei.<br/><br/>Era bine, trăia şi era fericită.<br/><br/>だあれ<br/><br/>Expeditor<br/><br/>Rezumat<br/><br/>Kagome, la un moment dat în viața ei, a fost o adolescentă destul de obișnuită până când a fost atacată de un demon în casa fântânii familiei ei. Demonul a târât-o în fântână, care a transportat-o prin magie aproximativ 500 de ani în trecut. Acolo, ea a aflat că o bijuterie sacră a fost închisă în interiorul corpului ei, deoarece ea era reîncarnarea unei preotese care a murit cu 50 de ani înainte de momentul în care a fost târâtă în ea. Bijuteria i-a fost smulsă din corp, iar demonul care a târât-o în timp a fost învins de jumătatea demonului pe care a eliberat-o, care a fost prinsă în copac. Kagome s-a împrietenit cu jumătate de demon, Inuyasha, în timp și a călătorit cu el pentru a restaura bijuteria pe care ea însăși a spart-o. Deși nu era atât de simplu și ușor de făcut ca mulți demoni și oameni au căutat bijuteria pentru propriile lor scopuri. S-a împrietenit cu un tânăr demon kitsune, un călugăr și un ucigaș de demoni care au călătorit cu ea pentru a restaura bijuteria.<br/><br/>Grupul ei, totuși, nu a fost cel care a finalizat bijuteria, ci un demon rău care a manipulat majoritatea evenimentelor majore din cea mai mare parte a vieții companionului ei. Când în cele din urmă a adunat toate piesele bijuteriei și și-a făcut dorința pe obiectul contaminat, Kagome a fost atrasă în bijuteria însăși cu intenția ca ea să facă o dorință egoistă de a o ține prinsă înăuntru pentru totdeauna, păstrând bijuteria în viață. A fost încăpățânarea lui Inuyasha care a reușit să o salveze de întuneric. În cele din urmă, ea s-a întors la timpul ei natural, a terminat liceul așa cum se aștepta de la o fată din cronologia ei. Deși zile mai târziu, Kagome a ajuns în Elysion. Ea a fost în această lume timp de cinci ani, și a renunțat mult timp la întoarcerea acasă. Ea s-a stabilit fericit în noua ei viață.<br/><br/>Platon<br/><br/>Este destul de ușor pentru Kagome să-și facă noi prieteni, ea nu s-a schimbat prea mult din tinerețea ei. Ea este o tânără veselă care este empatică și primitoare în cea mai mare parte din viața ei. În tinerețe, ea s-a împrietenit cu demonii atunci când cei mai mulți s-ar teme de ei. Chiar și demonii care obișnuiau să mănânce oameni, ea s-a împrietenit și le-a schimbat căile (ea ar dori să gândească). Acestea fiind spuse, este foarte ușor să devii prietenul ei atâta timp cât cineva este capabil să arate că este dispus să fie răscumpărat sau să arate că nu este complet rău. Ea simte foarte mult pentru toți cei pe care îi întâlnește, deci este greu pentru ea să nu fie atrasă de alții în dorința de a fi prieteni.<br/><br/>Antagonism<br/><br/>Singurul mod de a câştiga mânia lui Kagome este să fie atât de deplorabil, atât de rău, şi atât de departe de răscumpărare, încât ea nu poate vedea nici un bine în tine. Şi ea poate vedea binele în aproape toată lumea şi totul. Sincer, cu cine s-a confruntat? Un demon care a pus doi îndrăgostiţi unul împotriva celuilalt, care a blestemat întreaga linie masculină a unuia dintre prietenii ei, şi apoi l-a pus pe fratele celui mai bun prieten al ei să le ucidă familia... Simţiţi-vă liber să încercaţi.<br/><br/>Romantism<br/><br/>Când se îndrăgostește, Kagome este un sprijin puternic, rămânând mereu acolo chiar și atunci când lucrurile pot fi dificile. Cu toate acestea, Kagome nu caută dragoste, nu căuta dragoste când a sosit, astfel încât nici o relație din trecut nu există. Acest lucru nu înseamnă că cineva nu s-a îndrăgostit de ea. Ea poate fi cu siguranță subiectul iubirii neîmpărtășite a cuiva, ea va fi probabil neglijent despre asta, deși. În cele din urmă, Kagome este în prezent logodit cu Sesshoumaru, surprinzător. Cu toate acestea, sunt total deschisă la potențiale lucruri AU. <3<br/><br/>fandom iad<br/><br/>epocii antice<br/><br/>Specii de regină spațială<br/><br/>Ocupație muribundă<br/><br/>preferă ea<br/><br/>Premii<br/><br/>pro ea / ea est 62woo i suck la complot răspunsuri. dar ok oricum!!! neptune este foarte prietenos și are că "cool" persona, el este într-adevăr distractiv să fie în jur, și el este SUPER bun pentru a lucra cu. ca și cum ar fi super răbdător și ar face tot ce-i cere ea -- e foarte ușor să lucreze cu el, cu siguranță în comparație cu alte modele. așa că îmi place ideea că toți sunt prieteni orientați spre muncă la început și apoi se transformă în ceva mai mult. Neptune încearcă cu siguranță să se înconjoare de oameni, pentru că îi place să aibă prieteni, iar kagome este și el genul lui? ca ea este dulce și ea este o femeie puternică, și el este de fapt prieteni mai buni cu femeile decât el este cu bărbații, idk de ce, el doar iubește să fie înconjurat de prietene de sex feminin care știe. Îmi iubesc băieţii fiind prieteni foarte buni şi protejându-şi prietenele sincer, dar îmi plac relaţiile de tip pseduo-familie şi Neptune este un copil unic, aşa că nu a avut nici o relaţie de familie ca asta. așa că ea uitându-se la el toate sora mai mare ar dori să-l facă să fie ca ??????? pentru că el este confuz, dar, de asemenea, el chiar îi place că LOL! sunt amândoi copii buni, cred că ar fi foarte distractiv ^^<br/><br/>fandom foc emblemă: soarta<br/><br/>varsta ninteen<br/><br/>Specii Parte umană / parte dragon<br/><br/>Gardianul reprezentativ al ocupației<br/><br/>preferă ea<br/><br/>Premii<br/><br/>Acolo ea / ea aest 20 postări<br/><br/>Nu l-am văzut deloc pe Inuyasha, dar... din ce am citit, Kagome pare să fie unul dintre acei oameni care ar putea să-l ajute pe Corrin cu starea ei emoţională.

Imi place ideea ta ca Kagome sa ia o poza cu Elsa! Știi, ea este, de asemenea, o cântăreață / interpretă la un teatru local, așa că îmi pot imagina Kagome merge acolo pentru a cuprinde lucrurile și apoi prinde Elsa în culise sau ceva - și apoi prietenia ar putea înflori de acolo! Îmi place absolut ideea acestor două petreceri de calitate bff timp împreună făcând lucrurile mici, dar distractive Elsa nu a experimentat niciodată ca un copil.

| Why You Should be on Twitter<br/><br/>Disclaimer: I am not, nor have I ever claimed to be, a social media guru. I'm just a person who thinks about stuff a lot, and this has come up a number of times.<br/><br/>I'm not an early adopter. Sometimes it takes me years to figure out what I want to use something for before I actually get on it, and Twitter was one of those things. I've been on Twitter seriously since about February of this year, so I'm pretty new at it. Still, I've learned a number of things, and I wanted to share them. Some people say I'm a Twitter pusher, and I am, because there's lots of good reasons to get on it, and virtually no downsides.<br/><br/>So what's Twitter? If you're on the internet, you've probably at least heard of it. It's a social media network that serves as a forum for conversations, updates, and news in a medium more public than something like Facebook or LinkedIn. Facebook is about who wants to find you, but Twitter is about who you want to find. Your favourite writers, actors, politicians, singers, and scientists are probably on Twitter. So are your favourite charities, radio stations, news sites, and stores. And they want you to find them and listen to what they have to say. Everyone on Twitter, at least initially, wants to talk with you.<br/><br/>But why join that? Why be a part of it? There's all kinds of reasons, and I'm going to give you a few.<br/><br/>People and Places Twitter is a great way to find out about events which are going on around the world, but also in your community. If you're travelling and looking for things to do, it's a great way to find out about things relevant to your interests (because the people you follow are people you're interested in). Even if you're not travelling, knowing about great places to go locally or knowing that people you're interested in are going to them creates an opportunity to meet them and create a deeper relationship with them. If you go back to my party post, all the people in it but two, I heard about on Twitter and then met in real life, and now we're pretty good friends. And the more you do this, the more things you'll find out about, and the more people you'll meet. And if you follow them on Twitter, you already know a bit about what they're like. They want you to. The reverse is also true, because tweeting invites people to see what you're like, and they can make the same choices about you.<br/><br/>Inspiration and Motivation<br/>Inspiration comes from the strangest places, and the influx of tweets means there's always fresh content for your imagination. I have a follow first policy, so I'll follow just about anybody, and then periodically go through and unfollow people. I don't know who's going to plant the seed of a new blog post or new project in me, so I like to keep my options open. Motivation also happens, because Twitter is just like life. If you surround yourself with people who are ambitious, dedicated, generous, and hard-working, it's easier to be like that, and push yourself. It's easier to think that if they can plan events, launch projects, or just get up in the morning, well, so can you.<br/><br/>Learning and Lifestyle Bloggers are on Twitter. Bloggers who aren't may actually be crazy. And people blog about just about everything. If you're looking to learn something, odds are good that somebody's tweeting about it. On top of that, news services and stores are also connected, which means that you can get your news up to the minute, and find out about sales and deals as they start.As far as lifestyle, looking for new recipe ideas? Follow some caterers and see what they come up with. Need a twist for that cocktail party? Twitter's got people for that too. Wardrobe recommendations, or just want to see what other people are doing with their lives? It's all there.<br/><br/>There are some common challenges I face when talking about this, and they're legitimate obstacles. It can seem pretty daunting, especially if you're getting on the bandwagon late, like I did. I spent months following only two people and not knowing what else to do. But there are ways to overcome them, and hear they are from least frequent to most.<br/><br/>#3: Twitter is for Narcissistic Jerks<br/>I think this comes from the idea that most people tweet for and about themselves as a way of getting attention. What I don't get is why there's anything wrong with that, or why doing that makes one a narcissist or a jerk. If someone has something to say, they want to be heard. Used to be you'd stand on the street corner and yell. Now you can yell in 140 characters or less. Twitter's just a new way to be heard. Now, there are certainly narcissistic jerks on Twitter. They're pretty much everywhere. Sometimes, people are jerks. Sometimes one of those people is me, I'm sorry to say. Don't follow those people. If you don't like what someone is saying, whether that's points that they're making or detailed accounts of their bathroom activities, you don't have to listen on Twitter.<br/><br/>#2: I Can't Keep Track of It All<br/>The second obstacle people often bring up is that they just don't have time to keep track of all the things which are going on on Twitter. And you know what? That's fine. Keep track of what you can. Maybe you only wander on every few days. If you're a private user (rather than tweeting for your company), and especially a beginner, that's okay. Part of something is better than all of nothing.<br/><br/>#1 I've Got Nothing I Want to Put Out There<br/>This is by far the most frequent challenge people raise. And it doesn't even matter. You don't have to join Twitter to talk. Join it to listen. Again, your favourite authors, singers, bloggers, and newspapers are on here. This is your chance to listen to them. It's your chance to gain a window into their lives and activities, and they're inviting you to do that. Want to find out what Felicia Day is going to be up to at the San Diego Comic Con? Done. I know people who only listen on Twitter, and that's great. That's what I did for a while. Eventually, maybe you'll find something to tweet about, or make something to tweet about. I hope you do, because I want to hear about it.<br/><br/>In short, if you're not using Twitter, I think you should be. If you're not using it to its full extent, try to. Don't be afraid to follow five hundred people, if all of those people are saying things you're interested in. Invite those people into bits of your life, and see how it's improved by the interaction. I look forward to hearing from you. | De ce ar trebui să fii pe Twitter<br/><br/>Disclaimer: Nu sunt și nici nu am pretins vreodată că sunt un guru al social media. Sunt doar o persoană care se gândește mult la lucruri, iar acest lucru a apărut de mai multe ori.<br/><br/>Nu sunt un early adopter. Uneori îmi ia ani să-mi dau seama pentru ce vreau să folosesc ceva înainte de a ajunge cu adevărat pe ea, iar Twitter a fost unul dintre acele lucruri. Am fost pe Twitter serios din februarie din acest an, așa că sunt destul de nou la asta. Totusi, am invatat o serie de lucruri, si am vrut sa le impartasesc. Unii oameni spun ca sunt un pusher pe Twitter, si sunt, pentru ca exista o multime de motive bune pentru a ajunge pe ea, si practic nu exista dezavantaje.<br/><br/>Deci, ce este Twitter? Dacă sunteți pe internet, probabil ați auzit cel puțin despre el. Este o rețea de social media care servește ca un forum pentru conversații, actualizări și știri într-un mediu mai public decât ceva ca Facebook sau LinkedIn. Facebook este despre cine vrea să te găsească, dar Twitter este despre cine vrei să găsești. Scriitorii, actorii, politicienii, cântăreții și oamenii de știință preferați sunt probabil pe Twitter. La fel sunt și organizațiile de caritate, posturile de radio, site-urile de știri și magazinele preferate. Și vor ca tu să le găsești și să asculți ce au de spus. Toată lumea de pe Twitter, cel puțin la început, vrea să vorbească cu tine.<br/><br/>Dar de ce să vă alăturați? De ce să faceți parte din ea? Există tot felul de motive, și am de gând să vă dau câteva.<br/><br/>Twitter este o modalitate foarte bună de a afla despre evenimentele care se petrec în întreaga lume, dar și în comunitatea ta. Dacă călătorești și cauți lucruri de făcut, este o modalitate foarte bună de a afla despre lucruri relevante pentru interesele tale (pentru că oamenii pe care îi urmărești sunt oameni care te interesează). Chiar dacă nu călătorești, știind despre locurile minunate unde să mergi local sau știind că oamenii care te interesează merg la ei creează o oportunitate de a-i întâlni și de a crea o relație mai profundă cu ei. Dacă vă întoarceți la postarea mea de partid, toți oamenii din ea, cu excepția a doi, am auzit de pe Twitter și apoi ne-am întâlnit în viața reală, iar acum suntem prieteni destul de buni. Și cu cât faceți mai mult acest lucru, cu atât veți afla mai multe lucruri despre, și cu atât mai mulți oameni veți întâlni. Și dacă îi urmăriți pe Twitter, știți deja un pic despre cum sunt. Ei vor să o faceți. Inversul este, de asemenea, adevărat, pentru că tweeting-ul invită oamenii să vadă cum ești, și ei pot face aceleași alegeri despre tine.<br/><br/>Inspirație și motivație<br/>Inspirația vine din cele mai ciudate locuri, iar afluxul de tweet-uri înseamnă că există întotdeauna conținut proaspăt pentru imaginația ta. Am o politică de urmat mai întâi, așa că voi urma pe aproape oricine, și apoi periodic trec prin și de a nu mai urma oamenii. Nu știu cine va planta sămânța unei noi postări pe blog sau a unui nou proiect în mine, așa că îmi place să-mi păstrez opțiunile deschise. Motivația se întâmplă, de asemenea, pentru că Twitter este la fel ca viața. Dacă te înconjori de oameni ambițioși, dedicați, generoși și muncitori, este mai ușor să fii așa și să te împingi. Este mai ușor să te gândești că dacă ei pot planifica evenimente, pot lansa proiecte sau pur și simplu să se trezească dimineața, ei bine, și tu poți.<br/><br/>Învățarea și stilul de viață Bloggerii sunt pe Twitter. Bloggerii care nu sunt pot fi de fapt nebuni. Și oamenii blog despre aproape totul. Dacă sunteți în căutarea de a învăța ceva, șansele sunt bune că cineva tweetează despre asta. În plus, serviciile de știri și magazinele sunt, de asemenea, conectate, ceea ce înseamnă că puteți obține știrile până la minut și aflați despre vânzări și oferte pe măsură ce încep. În ceea ce privește stilul de viață, căutați idei noi de rețete? Urmați unele catering-uri și a vedea ce vin cu. Aveți nevoie de o răsucire pentru petrecerea de cocktail? Twitter are oameni pentru asta prea. Recomandări de garderobă, sau pur și simplu doriți să vedeți ce alți oameni fac cu viața lor? Este totul acolo.<br/><br/>Există unele provocări comune cu care mă confrunt atunci când vorbesc despre acest lucru, și acestea sunt obstacole legitime. Poate părea destul de înspăimântător, mai ales dacă te urci în vagonul de întârziere, cum am făcut-o eu. Mi-am petrecut luni de zile urmărind doar doi oameni și fără să știu ce altceva să fac. Dar există modalități de a-i depăși și de a auzi că sunt de la cel mai puțin frecvent la cel mai frecvent.<br/><br/>#3: Twitter este pentru narcisiști<br/>Cred că acest lucru vine din ideea că majoritatea oamenilor tweet pentru și despre ei înșiși ca o modalitate de a atrage atenția. Ceea ce nu înțeleg este de ce există ceva în neregulă cu asta, sau de ce face asta te face un narcisist sau un idiot. Dacă cineva are ceva de spus, vrea să fie auzit. Obișnuiai să stai la colțul străzii și să țipi. Acum poți țipa în 140 de caractere sau mai puțin. Twitter-ul este doar un nou mod de a fi auzit. Acum, există cu siguranță ticăloși narcisiști pe Twitter. Sunt aproape peste tot. Uneori, oamenii sunt nemernici. Uneori, unul dintre acei oameni sunt eu, îmi pare rău să spun. Nu urmați acei oameni. Dacă nu vă place ceea ce spune cineva, indiferent dacă acestea sunt punctele pe care le fac sau conturile detaliate ale activităților lor de baie, nu trebuie să ascultați pe Twitter.<br/><br/>#2 Nu pot ține evidența tuturor<br/>Al doilea obstacol pe care oamenii îl aduc adesea este că pur și simplu nu au timp să țină evidența tuturor lucrurilor care se întâmplă pe Twitter. Și știi ce? E bine. Ține evidența a ceea ce poți. Poate că rătăcești doar la fiecare câteva zile. Dacă ești un utilizator privat (mai degrabă decât să tweetezi pentru compania ta), și mai ales un începător, este în regulă. O parte din ceva este mai bună decât nimic.<br/><br/>#1 Nu am nimic ce vreau să pun acolo<br/>Aceasta este de departe cea mai frecventă provocare pe care oamenii o ridică. Și nici măcar nu contează. Nu trebuie să vă alăturați Twitter pentru a vorbi. Alăturați-vă pentru a asculta. Din nou, autorii, cântăreții, bloggerii și ziarele preferate sunt aici. Aceasta este şansa ta de a-i asculta. Este şansa ta de a câştiga o fereastră în vieţile şi activităţile lor, şi ei te invită să faci asta. Vrei să afli ce Felicia Day va fi de până la San Diego Comic Con? Făcut. Știu oameni care ascultă doar pe Twitter, și asta e grozav. Asta am făcut pentru o vreme. În cele din urmă, poate veți găsi ceva să tweet, sau să faceți ceva să tweet. Sper că da, pentru că vreau să aud despre asta.<br/><br/>Pe scurt, dacă nu folosiți Twitter, cred că ar trebui să o faceți. Dacă nu o utilizați pe deplin, încercați să o faceți. Nu vă fie frică să urmați cinci sute de oameni, dacă toți acei oameni spun lucruri care vă interesează. Invită-i pe acei oameni în bucăţi din viaţa ta şi vezi cum se îmbunătăţeşte interacţiunea. |
| Root Canals<br/><br/>The very thought of getting a root canal puts most people on edge. SCM Dental utilizes the latest technology and technique to make a root canal a virtually pain free and low stress procedure.<br/><br/>Rotary endodontics is an advanced technology and technique to perform endodontic treatment, the clinical term for a root canalThe term "root canal" refers to the natural cavity at the center of the tooth. The tooth's nerve is located in soft tissue (pulp) inside the root canal. If the tooth is damaged either by trauma or decay, debris can enter the sensitive root canal area and cause an infection, or in extreme circumstances, and abscess. An abscessed tooth is very serious and should be treated as an emergency, as it can create an infection that may spread to other parts of the body. If you believe you have an abscessed tooth, contact our office immediately to schedule emergency care.<br/><br/>Depending on the case, root canal therapy may require more than one visit. An initial x-ray will be taken to evaluate the tooth and root canal and determine the extent of the damage and infection if present. You will be given a form of anesthesia to make you relaxed.<br/><br/>When the area is numb, our dentist will create an access chamber to the root canal using an electric handpiece. Next, the root canal will be scraped of the infected or damaged tissue and nerve. Once the entire area has been throughly cleaned and polished, the tooth will be filled with a biocompatible rubber compound called gutta percha. The tooth is then covered with a dental filling or dental crown to restore strength and function.<br/><br/>Endodontic therapy has a bad reputation as being a painful procedure. With rotary endodontics, a root canal procedure is no more painful than having a dental filling placed. The infection and damage to the nerve is what creates the extreme pain and discomfort and patients you will experience significant relief after undergoing root canal therapy. Root canals have a success rate of 95% and allow people to preserve their natural teeth. | Canale rădăcină<br/><br/>Chiar gândul de a obține un canal radicular pune majoritatea oamenilor pe margine. SCM Dental utilizează cea mai recentă tehnologie și tehnică pentru a face un canal radicular o procedură practic fără durere și stres scăzut.<br/><br/>Endodonția rotativă este o tehnologie și o tehnică avansată pentru efectuarea tratamentului endodontic, termenul clinic pentru un canal radicularTermenul "canal radicular" se referă la cavitatea naturală din centrul dintelui. Nervul dintelui este localizat în țesutul moale (pulpa) din interiorul canalului radicular. Dacă dintele este deteriorat fie de traume, fie de carii, resturile pot pătrunde în zona sensibilă a canalului radicular și pot provoca o infecție sau, în circumstanțe extreme, un abces. Un dinte abcesat este foarte grav și ar trebui tratat ca o urgență, deoarece poate crea o infecție care se poate răspândi în alte părți ale corpului. Dacă credeți că aveți un dinte abcesat, contactați imediat biroul nostru pentru a programa îngrijirea de urgență.<br/><br/>În funcție de caz, terapia canalului radicular poate necesita mai mult de o vizită. O radiografie inițială va fi luată pentru a evalua dintele și canalul radicular și pentru a determina amploarea daunelor și a infecției dacă este prezentă. Vi se va administra o formă de anestezie pentru a vă relaxa.<br/><br/>Când zona este amorțită, medicul dentist va crea o cameră de acces la canalul radicular folosind o piesă de mână electrică. Apoi, canalul radicular va fi răzuit din țesutul și nervul infectat sau deteriorat. Odată ce întreaga zonă a fost curățată și lustruită, dintele va fi umplut cu un compus de cauciuc biocompatibil numit gutta percha. Dintele este apoi acoperit cu o umplutură dentară sau coroană dentară pentru a restabili puterea și funcția.<br/><br/>Terapia endodontică are o reputație proastă ca fiind o procedură dureroasă. Cu endodonția rotativă, o procedură de canal radicular nu este mai dureroasă decât plasarea unei umpluturi dentare.

| Churchyard Bottom Wood<br/><br/>Highgate<br/><br/>Churchyard Bottom Wood, Highgate<br/><br/>Now called Queen's Wood<br/><br/>Between 1860 and 1880 the centre was torn out of the City of London to build sewers, railways and new roads. Houses were demolished without regard for the tenants who had to find whatever accommodation they could elsewhere. Managers went to livo in Kensington and St. John's Wood, while the poorest crowded into the rookeries like Seven Dials and Lisson Grove. For those between, the clerks and skilled workmen, speculative builders put up row after row of terraced villas and Mr Pooter moved into Holloway. The people of Muswell Hill watched houses creep across the fields of Finsbury Park, up Crouch Hill and down the other side, so that by 1880, Crouch End was being developed and there seemed no way to stem the flow. Ten years later the large estates of Muswell Hill were being sold. Upton Farm was sold and the Ecclesiastical Commissioners wanted to develop Churchyard Bottom Wood, now called Queen's Wood. The story would have made an Ibsen play. Two groups of honest, highly motivated people fighting for what they each thought was right. The Ecclesiastical Commissioners on the one hand and the Committee of the Hornsey Charities on the other, both believed they were doing their best for other people, and the public rose against them both in indignation<br/><br/>At that time Muswell Hill Road was a country road, with Southwood Hall at one end and Upton Farm at the other. By 1894, Onslow Gardens was built, Connaught Gardens marked out, and builders were poised to develop the Woodlands estate. Cut out of Churchyard Bottom Wood was a group of tumble-down cottages, on a triangular site. An undated map, held by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners shows six Wasteland Cottages with an opening between them - not a road, not metalled, but a way through to the strawberry beds behind. Further along was another gap which led to footpaths through the wood. These two openings were to be the basis of the plan. The same two gaps and the cleared ground, which was the strawberry field, can be seen in the 1894 map below. They are shown as 'Muswell Hill Cottages' and, quite in passing, Peter Sellers was to live on the same site much later on. To develop the wood as a housing estate, the Commissioners needed to drive two roads through from Muswell Hill Road and build houses along them. The Muswell Hill Road frontage alone would not have provided room for enough houses to make the venture worthwhile.<br/><br/>The land and cottages had been given much earlier as almshouses to house old people and were held on their behalf by the Trustees of the Hornsey Charity Commissioners. By the 1890s the cottages were tumble-down, in need of major repair. Public-spirited, wishing to do the best for their old tenants, the Trustees could not improve them since they had no money. Some years before the Ecclesiastical Commissioners had planned to develop Gravel Pit Wood (now Highgate Wood) as a housing estate, but this had met such opposition that they backed down. Instead, in 1886, they gave all 69 acres woodland to the public. At the same time they offered to sell Churchyard Bottom Wood to Hornsey Urban District Council for £25,000, but this was too much for Hornsey to raise on its own. The Council said that people living outside Hornsey also enjoyed the wood and other authorities should help, but no help was given. In the end the offer fell into abeyance.<br/><br/>Map showing the Muswell Hill Cottages which were the centre of the controversy.<br/><br/>Muswell Hill Road about 1880<br/><br/>It seems probable that these three pairs of cottages<br/>were the ones at the centre of the dispute.<br/><br/>The Ecclesiastical Commissioners wanted to raise money for its church work in Britain and abroad. They considered that they had been given the land to be used for the propogat­ion of religion and if this meant selling off land or woods, it was a lesser evil than restricting the work of the church. They had given Gravel Pit Wood to the public: in its place they would develop Churchyard Bottom Wood.<br/><br/>The Trustees of the Hornsey Charities wanted to produce an income to help their poor people, so they made an offer to the Commissioners. Their triangular piece of land was too awkwardly shaped to be developed economically, but if the Commissioners would grant them some more land to make it into a square site, they would build twenty-five neat villas. These would bring in ground rents of £225 per annum, which could be used to relieve the poverty of Hornsey people. In return they would permit the Commission­ers to cut two roads through their land so that the Commissioners could develop the woods.<br/><br/>When this offer became known people immediately reacted with alarm.<br/><br/>On the 16th December 1893 Mr Carvell Williams MP asked in the House of Commons, if the Ecclesiastical Commissioners had consented to sell a strip of land to the Hornsey Charities Trustees on condition that an existing road be widened to 40 feet, whether this was a preliminary to a building scheme and if the House of Parliament would have an opportunity to express an opinion.<br/><br/>Mr Leveson Gower, a Church Estates Commissioner replied',"Yes" to the first part.<br/><br/>Mr Carvell Williams, "Do I understand it is the intention to destroy that portion of Highgate Woods by building on it?"<br/><br/>Two days later The Star published an article worthy of any modern tabloid.<br/><br/>The Star<br/>18th December 1893<br/><br/>'Parliament must keep a keen watch on those old vandals and confederates of the jerry-builder the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. They are always alienating some piece of land or are favouring the builders as opposed to the general public. The Commissioners would not sell the Churchyard Bottom wood to the ratepayers but now propose 'to open it up' by cutting two wide roads through it in connection with one of their numerous building schemes. Will not someone ask a question in Parliament and check the brick and mortar policy of the Commissioners?'<br/><br/>By the time this was printed, the question had been asked and the answer was either untrue, or devious. Other papers took up the story. The Times, in a long report, said that the Comnussioners were not prepared to give an undertaking that Parliament, or any other public body, should have an opportunity of considering any scheme for building on the site of the wood.<br/><br/>The situation simmered for eighteen months until the Ecclesiastical Commissioners were forced to open an enquiry, which began at Highgate on 31 May 1895, chaired by an Assistant Ecclesiastical Commissioner. The Inquiry produced a flurry of newspaper letters of which this was the most important.<br/><br/>The Daily Chronicle, 5 June 1895<br/><br/>VANDALISM AT HIGHGATE<br/><br/>Sir –<br/><br/>One of the most lovely bits of woodland in suburan London is threatened. Will you help us to ward off what would be a calamity, not only to the immediate district, but to the whole of densely-populated North London? In no part of the metropolis has the builder been more active than in Crouch End and Hornsey. The beautiful meadows of a year or two ago are now houses and shops. Ballast heaps have taken the place of stately elms and chestnuts, and once pleasant villages are sharing the fate of Stroud Green, Harringay, Finsbury Park, Highbury and Islington. ---<br/><br/>---- The object is the construction of two forty-foot roads through the woods. We in this district know the meaning of forty-foot roads through woods. It means that the woods are doomed. Ten years ago agitation saved the sister-wood of sixty-five acres - The Gravel Pit Woods - and no one who saw the Bank Holiday crowds flocking up the Archway Road from the dreary streets of Holloway, Islington and Clerkenwell, and watched the keen enjoyment of the children and family parties picnicking on the grass and among the trees, could fail to realise the immense boon that the grant by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners of this wood has been to the whole of North London, but the Lower Wood of sixty acres has always been regarded as a natural complement of the other. ----<br/><br/>--- The Ecclesiastical Commissioners own nearly one-third of the large parish of Hornsey. By the liberal expenditure of the ratepayers' money in the opening up of roads and the general development of the district, the value of their property has been enormously increased, and from this unearned increment they each year draw large revenues. Surely the ratepayers whose money has thus aided in creating the immense estate may expect liberal treatment in return. ---<br/><br/>Yours obediently,<br/><br/>Signed by The Vicar of St James', Muswell Hill, the Minister of Park Chapel, Crouch End, a barrister living in Onslow Gardens and three members of the District Council.<br/><br/>It was a shot right across the bows of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. Their own religious leaders and the District Council, all up in arms saying in effect that the church was too rich and should be charitable, not greedy. The inclusion of the two clergymen was a shrewd move. Remember to that this was still in the height of the Darwin controversy. Darwin had split belief in the teachings of the Church and many people would have resented the power of the Church from that point of view alone. The Church was not so secure as it pretended to be.<br/><br/>The Evening News, 7 June 1895 said:-<br/><br/>"If the Ecclesiastical Comnussioners are not tackled at once, the building octopus will get a grip of the wood which will be very difficult to loosen later on, ---. Therefore it behoves Londoners to be up and doing if they would save one of their most delightful bits of rustic scenery. The public inquiry stands adjourned to Thursday next, and before then something must be done to convince the Commissioners that the citizens of London will not tolerate the confiscation of one of their favourite playgrounds."<br/><br/>A letter in the Daily Chronicle the next day said:-<br/><br/>.... It was with great relief that that the residents, some ten years ago, heard that the purchase of the Upper Wood had been effected; and how delightful a boon this has proved, anyone who visited them can testify, but all who exerted themselves to save these upper woods, which lie on the west side of Muswell Hill road, felt that their victory was incomplete so long as the sixty acres on the east side remained in danger. It is, as it were, an accident that the woods are divided by a broad high road. Can anyone doubt what the effect would be if the Churchyard Bottom Wood were replaced by rows of small villas, each sending out its contribution of smoke and soot? Can anyone doubt, too, the serious difference it would make to the picturesque setting of the purchased woods if a line of staring new houses were to be run up right over against their leafy frontage?'<br/><br/>This expressed the opinions of many people. In fact, the Gravel Pit Wood, which the writer calls the 'Upper Wood', had not been purchased, but given to the district by the Ecclesiastical Commission, a point they were to reiterate time and again over the years, but most people ignored it. The Commission was not going to give away a second wood whatever anyone said, and held this position to the end.<br/><br/>H.S.Chamberlain, of 5 Cranley Gardens,<br/>in a letter to the Times dated June 8, 1895, urged purchase.<br/><br/>I know that it is common to speak harshly of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, but as the trustees of a fund they are bound to administer it to the greatest advantage, and therefore, if anything is to be done to save the demolition of the wood, it appears to me that it can only be effected by the purchase of the property from the Comnussioners, who I know, are fully alive to the protection of free and open spaces for the people, and who, I feel sure, would be disposed to treat the matter of a purchase in a free and liberal spirit, as they have already done in the matter of the Shepherd's Cot-field, by granting a lease to the Crouch End Playing-fields Company - a small company in which I own a few shares, a small company which was formed exclusively for the purpose of securing the fields for cricket, tennis etc.<br/><br/>(This refers the the Crouch End Playing Fields which had been secured a few years later.)<br/><br/>As Chairman of the Muswell Hill Conservative Association, I am constantly in touch with the inhabitants, and I can safely affirm that every person resident in the neighbourhood would do anything in reason to preserve.<br/><br/>(All he wanted personally was Charity income to support his poor people. He demanded his acre of land - not a great deal surely - he believed the Commissioners' assurance that the wood was not in danger.)<br/><br/>' Muswell Hill Road was one of the best in Hornsey and would remain equally beautiful, houses or no houses',<br/><br/>(and then came the great rhetorical flourish.)<br/><br/>'Are the poor to suffer because of the sentimental objections and the hysterical cry of 'wolf just raised by your correspondents? Something must be done and that soon. An acre of back-land added to the charity-estate would make no apprec­iable difference to the land remaining, while the profit derived from it would succour many poor old and deserving persons in their declining years and enable us to hand over to our successors an estate which in the distant future would be of great value in the rendering of charitable aid to the deserving poor of the parish of Hornsey.'<br/><br/>Reading his letter one senses hysteria very near the surface. Why did he think the Commissioners wanted to build a road? Why should they spend all that money if not to build houses? He never seemed to realise that for an acre of land the the whole wood would be lost. But he had been with the problem for a long time. He was the person to whom the Commissioners had made the offer of sale for £25,000 years before and it is his name which is honoured in a plaque on Crouch End Clock Tower for saving the wood, but his trust in the Ecclesiastical Commissioners seems naive. It is sad that at the Inquiry he was to be cast as the devil.<br/><br/>The Inquiry Continued<br/><br/>The adjourned opened in Highgate on 15 June 1895. Expecting a large gather­ing, the Council Chamber had been changed completely. The usual tables had been removed and the room filled with chairs. By half past seven the room was crowded, with people jostling for seats.<br/><br/>Mr Murray, the Commissioner, said the Inquiry was really a simple one. Hornsey Parochial Charities wished to purchase a piece of land adjoining their charity property at the back. The question was whether the Charity Commission, which controlled all charities, had enough power to stop them. The Church Commissioners were prepared to sell the land at very favourable terms and the income of the Charity would be very considerable increased.<br/><br/>Against this there were three classes of objection.<br/><br/>The original Trust was for the purpose of providing cottages for the Poor, but the trustees were proposing to build villas which would be too expensive for the Poor. However, it was within the power of the Trustees to vary the terms of the Trust, so they could build villas if they thought that the Poor would benefit in the end. The poor people themselves might object, but liberal provisions had already been promised for them. The third objection related to the aesthetic and public side of the question. He took it from what he had read that the Charity Commission ought to interfere to prevent the Ecclesiastical Commissioners from exercising their own discretion in dealing with their own property.<br/><br/>The Inquiry discussed fine points, but the speakers kept coming back to the major problem of preventing any destruction of the wood. The Vestry Clerk of Islington, representing 300,000 people, made a formal protest about any part of the wood, so valuable for the people of Islington and Hornsey being used for private purposes. Mr Wilfred White said that if the Commissioners would give them time they would be able to raise the money to compensate the Trustees.<br/><br/>Mr Beaumont said they did not want villas, they wanted cottages for poor people who were being driven out of the district. Others said that there was no money to build cottages to replace the present delapidated ones but villas would be an economic proposition. Others retorted that there were score of villas to let in Highgate. The Wood was sacred. Stick to the question of the Wood.<br/><br/>Dr Fletcher said the cry among the working people was that there was nowhere to go. Working people came to him with the cry, "We are driven out of Highgate and are obliged to go to Highgate New Town." If the Muswell Hill Road frontage was sold there was no question but that roads might be cut right through the woods in the direction of Hornsey, but if the Commissioners could not get the land from the Charity Commission they could not cut the road.<br/><br/>He was very sure the cottages could be put into a fit state of repair. He was asked by the poor people, by the police and by a number of the working classes to represent these two points, that cottage accommodation was very sorely needed in Highgate and that if they once allowed the land to be sold, there was no telling where the hand of the builder would be stayed.<br/><br/>(Loud and prolonged cheers).<br/><br/>Numerous other people spoke and the Comnussioner summed up by saying that he took it that the prevailing opinion was in favour of retaining the cottages but the meeting should draw no conclusions from what he had said (Groans).<br/><br/>Others said that the Trustees of the Charity had failed in their duties by letting the the cottages fall into disrepair.<br/><br/>Mr H.R.Williams, the Trustee who had written to the paper earlier, said that he had it on the best authority that the Church Commissioners would make no roads whatever and they would not be benefitted one iota by the actions of the Charity Commissioners. Others were far less trusting and the meeting closed after nearly three hours.<br/><br/>'We are faced with the fact that in Highgate and Muswell Hill there are a number of persons who want the Churchyard Bottom Wood and will not be happy until they have got it - while nobody appears willing to spend a farthing to pay for it. Everyone says it would be a fine thing to have the wood as open space, but everybody thinks it is the duty of someone else to make it one. The Islington Vestry has 'resolved' on the subject, but the Islington Vestry does not offer a penny piece towards the purchase. --- There is no more difficult problem for the community or the individual to solve than how to gain possession of other people's property without paying for it.'<br/><br/>Paying for it was indeed the problem as Churchyard Bottom Wood became the subject of intense local and national debate. A joint committee was formed to raise money to save the wood. On 20 November 1896, C.F.Cory-Wright, Hon Treasurer, wrote to The Standard, a daily paper at that time, appealing for help. He reminded everyone of the danger of losing the wood and said it could only be saved by buying it. The Church Commissioners would sell for £25,000 and an extra (5,000 would be required for fencing and drainage, making a total of £30,000. This was too much for Hornsey Council to raise but they had already voted £10,000 towards the total. The woods were of inestimable value to all of North London so he appealed to public bodies and private people to raise the remaining £20,000. He warned that the present offer from the Church Commissioners was open only to the end of 1898. After that the builders would move in.<br/><br/>The appeal was warmly welcomed by the press. A Private Bill was rushed through Parliament and the Highgate Woods Preservation Act, 1897, became law. The Conunittee now had the right to advertise for contributions towards buying the Wood and preserving it.<br/><br/>In a fairly short time almost all the money was raised, but the last few thousand proved very difficult to raise and the Commissioners' deadline was a matter of weeks away. Mr Cory-Wright wrote pleading for more time but was granted a mere three months and then only if interest at 4 per cent was paid for the extra period on the full sum. In the end the London County Council, which had originally offered £2,500, made this up to £5,000 and the total was reached, but it was a close-run thing.<br/><br/>The Council decided to re-name the Wood as 'Queen's Woods' in honour of Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee and Hornsey put on a fine display of bunting when the Duchess of Albany formally declared the Wood open 'for the free use of the public for ever'.<br/><br/>While the campaign to save Churchyard Bottom Wood was run and directed by local people who felt passionately about this particular piece of woodland, they called on the help and experience of a vast network of people, some of whom had worked together on similar campaigns for over thirty years. The Committee issued an appeal, printed on very good quality paper and bearing some famous names.<br/><br/>The questions of open space and public health were major subjects of the Victorian vision.<br/><br/>The Open Spaces Movement<br/><br/>Octavia Hill, the great housing reformer, who had begun with three old houses in Marylebone, bought for her by Jolm Ruskin, had quickly become an expert on housing poor people in the healthiest conditions possible. Her way was to buy leases and then knock down some of the crowded houses in order to bring light and air to the rest, believing that fresh air and sunlight were the the only way poor people could be saved from 'putrid fever. She had learnt this as a child from her grandfather, Southwood Smith, who developed his theories at the Fever Hospital at King's Cross.<br/><br/>He had built the first Industrial Dwellings for poor people and had proved statistically that good air and decent drainage saved lives. Gibson Gardens, in Northwold Road, is a direct outcome of Southwood Smith's ideas. More Information on Gibson Gardens<br/><br/>The Importance of Open Air<br/><br/>Open spaces and the opportunity to breathe clean air, were essential for people living in one or two crowded rooms. Octavia Hill took her charges from the Lisson Grove slums, up Fitzjohn's Avenue to Hampstead Heath. She so loved the Fitzjohn's Avenue fields that she tried to buy them as a public park. They were to cost £10,000 and within three August weeks £8,500 had been raised. It needed only the end of the summer holidays and the return from holiday of sympathetic friends and the further £1,500 would have been raised, but the owners suddenly withdrew their offer. Despite all pleading, the fields were covered with large houses.<br/><br/>From this developed the campaign to save Parliament Hill, the next open space northwards from Lisson Grove, buying up fields in the path of the builders to make a permanent cordon sanitalre against the advancing bricks. The Parliament Hill Fields campaign was so successful that the Hampstead Heath Bill was passed and there was money over from the appeal. From this money and the impetus towards open spaces, was to develop the National Trust. Octavia Hill had been interested in protecting areas like Church Bottom Wood for years, so she was a natural ally in the fight to save the Wood.<br/><br/>The Commons Preservation Society also, was familiar with this kind of agitation and money collection. They had torn down fencing when lords of the manor had enclosed pieces of common land, leading both legal and illegal battles against the arrogant privatization of land traditionally free. Robert Hunter, their Honorary Solicitor from 1868, was always concerned with securing open spaces, large or small, for the public. He, now Sir Robert Hunter, became the Chairman of the Church Bottom Appeal. The Chairman of the Commons Preservation Society was Mr Shaw-Lefevre MP (later Lord Eversley) who played a big part in this and other campaigns in the House of Commons. Octavia Hill had been involved in their work from about 1875.<br/><br/>At the same time Octavia Hill was campaigning for a Burials Bill.<br/><br/>City churchyards had become so full and such a serious a hazard to health, by contaminating wells from which people drew their drinking water, that City burials were no longer permitted. Instead, cemetries were created on the outskirts of town. Abney Park Cemetary was one of these. There was then a movement to remove the headstones to the edges of the old town cemetries, re-inter the bodies elsewhere and turn the cemetries into gardens and open spaces, instead of building on them. This land in the centre of London was very valuable and speculators were avid to obtain it: Even the Quakers had built over one of their cemetries and threatened to do so again by building over Bunhill Fields. Octavia Hill had a network of allies in a dozen fields, so her help to save the Church Bottom Wood must have been invaluable.<br/><br/>The Metropolitan Gardens Society, set up in 1882, had laid out about two hundred small gardens in city centres by 1890. They later handed them over to the Local Authorities, so their support for the Churchyard Bottom Wood Appeal was assured from the start.<br/><br/>The Kyrle Society is forgotten now, but in its day had great influence on Town Planning and Open Space legislation. The Society had been set up about 1875 for 'the Diffusion of Beauty', to bring colour and interest into the lives of people living in dull, drab surroundings. Bright colour to walls and decoration, good singing, open spaces, Nature, Literature and Art. All these fell within the Society's remit. There was a Decorative Branch, for whom William Morris lectured; a Musical Branch to promote choirs and Happy Evenings for people in local school buildings; and a Literature Branch. The Society appealed regularly by letters in The Times, to 'the richer classes' for books and periodicals to be distributed to boys' and girls' clubs, almshouses and elsewhere. However the Open Spaces Committee was the most active. The very name 'Kyrle' came from Pope's The Man of Ross, the philanthropist who gave his birthplace to the people as a public park. | Lemn de fund Bisericii<br/><br/>Highgate<br/><br/>Biserică din Bottom Wood, Highgate<br/><br/>Acum se numeşte pădurea reginei.<br/><br/>Între 1860 și 1880 centrul a fost smuls din City of London pentru a construi canalizări, căi ferate și drumuri noi. Casele au fost demolate fără a ține cont de chiriașii care trebuiau să găsească orice cazare în altă parte. Managerii s-au dus să trăiască în Kensington și St. John's Wood, în timp ce cei mai săraci s-au aglomerat în turnuri precum Seven Dials și Lisson Grove. Pentru cei dintre ei, funcţionarii şi muncitorii calificaţi, constructorii speculativi au pus rând după rând de vile terasate, iar domnul Pooter s-a mutat în Holloway. Oamenii din Muswell Hill au privit casele târându-se pe câmpurile din Finsbury Park, pe dealul Crouch și pe cealaltă parte, astfel încât până în 1880, Crouch End era în curs de dezvoltare și nu părea să existe nicio modalitate de a opri fluxul. Zece ani mai târziu, marile proprietăți ale Muswell Hill au fost vândute. Upton Farm a fost vândută și Comisarii Ecleziastici au vrut să dezvolte Churchyyard Bottom Wood, acum numit Queen's Wood. Povestea ar fi făcut o piesă de teatru Ibsen. Două grupuri de oameni cinstiți, foarte motivați, care luptă pentru ceea ce fiecare a crezut că este corect. Comisarii ecleziastici, pe de o parte, și Comitetul de Caritate Hornsey, pe de altă parte, amândoi credeau că fac tot ce pot pentru alți oameni, iar publicul s-a ridicat împotriva lor, amândoi indignați.<br/><br/>La acea vreme Muswell Hill Road era un drum de țară, cu Southwood Hall la un capăt și Upton Farm la celălalt. Până în 1894, Grădinile Onslow au fost construite, Grădinile Connaught marcate, iar constructorii erau gata să dezvolte proprietatea Woodlands. Tăiat de la Churchyard Bottom Wood a fost un grup de cabane prăbușite, pe un site triunghiular. O hartă nedatată, deținută de Comisarii Ecleziastici arată șase Cottages Wasteland cu o deschidere între ele - nu un drum, nu metalizat, ci o cale prin paturile de căpșuni din spate. Mai departe a fost un alt decalaj care a dus la poteci prin pădure. Aceste două deschideri trebuiau să fie baza planului. Aceleași două goluri și terenul curat, care a fost câmpul de căpșuni, pot fi văzute în harta 1894 de mai jos. Ele sunt prezentate ca "Muswell Hill Cottages" și, destul de întâmplător, Peter Sellers urma să locuiască pe același site mult mai târziu. Pentru a dezvolta lemnul ca o proprietate de locuit, Comisarii trebuiau să conducă două drumuri de la Muswell Hill Road și să construiască case de-a lungul lor. Fațada drumului Muswell Hill nu ar fi oferit suficient spațiu pentru case pentru a face aventura să merite.<br/><br/>Terenul și cabanele au fost date mult mai devreme ca case de pomană pentru a găzdui bătrâni și au fost deținute în numele lor de către administratorii Comisarilor de Caritate Hornsey. Până în anii 1890, cabanele au fost dărâmate, având nevoie de reparații majore. Cu spirit public, dorind să facă tot ce este mai bine pentru vechii lor chiriași, administratorii nu i-au putut îmbunătăți, deoarece nu aveau bani. Cu câțiva ani înainte ca Comisarii Ecleziastici să plănuiască să dezvolte Gravel Pit Wood (acum Highgate Wood) ca o zonă de locuit, dar acest lucru s-a întâlnit cu o astfel de opoziție încât au dat înapoi. În schimb, în 1886, au dat publicului toate cele 69 de acri de pădure. În același timp, s-au oferit să vândă Churchyard Bottom Wood Consiliului Districtual Urban Hornsey pentru 25.000 de lire sterline, dar acest lucru a fost prea mult pentru Hornsey să ridice pe cont propriu. Consiliul a spus că oamenii care trăiesc în afara Hornsey, de asemenea, bucurat de lemn și alte autorități ar trebui să ajute, dar nici un ajutor a fost dat. În cele din urmă oferta a căzut în suspensie.<br/><br/>Harta care arată Cottages Muswell Hill, care au fost centrul controversei.<br/><br/>Muswell Hill Road în jurul anului 1880<br/><br/>Se pare că aceste trei perechi de cabane au fost cele din centrul disputei.<br/><br/>Comisarii ecleziastici au vrut să strângă bani pentru lucrarea lor bisericească în Marea Britanie și în străinătate. Ei considerau că li s-a dat pământul pentru a fi folosit pentru promovarea religiei și dacă acest lucru însemna vânzarea terenurilor sau a pădurilor, era un rău mai mic decât restricționarea lucrării bisericii. Ei au dat publicului Gravel Pit Wood: în locul lui au dezvoltat Churchyyard Bottom Wood.<br/><br/>Administratorii Hornsey Charities au vrut să producă un venit pentru a-și ajuta săracii, așa că au făcut o ofertă comisarilor. Terenul lor triunghiular avea o formă prea stânjenitoare pentru a fi dezvoltat economic, dar dacă comisarii le-ar acorda mai mult teren pentru a-l transforma într-un loc pătrat, ar construi douăzeci și cinci de vile curate. Acestea ar aduce chirii de teren de 225 de lire sterline pe an, care ar putea fi utilizate pentru a ușura sărăcia populației Hornsey. În schimb, acestea ar permite Comisiei să taie două drumuri prin terenurile lor, astfel încât comisarii să poată dezvolta pădurile.<br/><br/>Când această ofertă a devenit cunoscută, oamenii au reacționat imediat cu alarmă.<br/><br/>La 16 decembrie 1893, deputatul Carvell Williams a întrebat în Camera Comunelor, dacă Comisarii Ecleziastici au consimțit să vândă o fâșie de teren administratorilor caritabili Hornsey cu condiția ca un drum existent să fie lărgit la 40 de picioare, dacă aceasta a fost o pregătire pentru o schemă de construcție și dacă Camera Parlamentului ar avea posibilitatea de a-și exprima opinia.<br/><br/>Dl Leveson Gower, un comisar pentru proprietatea bisericii, a răspuns „Da” la prima parte.<br/><br/>Dl. Carvell Williams: "Înţeleg că intenţionează să distrugă acea porţiune de Highgate Woods construind pe ea?"<br/><br/>Două zile mai târziu, The Star a publicat un articol demn de orice tabloid modern.<br/><br/>Steaua<br/>18 decembrie 1893<br/><br/>„Parlamentul trebuie să vegheze cu atenţie asupra acelor vandali şi confederaţi ai constructorului de jerry, Comisarii Ecleziastici, care mereu înstrăinează o bucată de pământ sau îi favorizează pe constructori în detrimentul publicului larg. Comisarii nu au vrut să vândă lemnul din partea de jos a bisericii contribuabililor, dar acum propun "să-l deschidă" prin tăierea a două drumuri largi prin el în legătură cu unul dintre numeroasele lor scheme de construcție. Nu va pune cineva o întrebare în Parlament și nu va verifica politica de cărămidă și mortar a comisarilor?”<br/><br/>La momentul tipăririi, întrebarea fusese pusă, iar răspunsul era fie neadevărat, fie înşelător. The Times, într-un raport lung, a spus că Comnussionerii nu erau pregătiți să dea o promisiune că Parlamentul, sau orice alt organism public, ar trebui să aibă posibilitatea de a lua în considerare orice schemă de construcție pe site-ul lemnului.<br/><br/>Situația a durat optsprezece luni până când Comisarii Ecleziastici au fost forțați să deschidă o anchetă, care a început la Highgate la 31 mai 1895, prezidată de un Comisar Ecleziastic Asistent. Ancheta a produs o serie de scrisori de ziar, dintre care aceasta a fost cea mai importantă.<br/><br/>The Daily Chronicle, 5 iunie 1895<br/><br/>VANDALISMUL LA HIGHGATE<br/><br/>Domnule...<br/><br/>Una dintre cele mai frumoase bucăți de pădure din suburanul Londrei este amenințată. Ne puteți ajuta să îndepărtăm ceea ce ar fi o calamitate, nu numai pentru cartierul imediat, ci pentru întregul nord dens populat al Londrei? În nici o parte a metropolei, constructorul nu a fost mai activ decât în Crouch End și Hornsey. Frumoasele pajiști de acum un an sau doi sunt acum case și magazine. Mulțimile de balast au luat locul ulmilor și castanelor mărețe și, odată, satele plăcute împărtășesc soarta lui Stroud Green, Harringay, Finsbury Park, Highbury și Islington.<br/><br/>---- Obiectul este construirea a două drumuri de patruzeci de picioare prin pădure. Noi în acest cartier știm semnificația drumurilor de patruzeci de picioare prin pădure. Înseamnă că pădurea este condamnată. Acum zece ani, agitaţia a salvat pădurea soră de şaizeci şi cinci de acri - pădurea de pietriş - şi nimeni care nu a văzut mulţimile de sărbători de bancă înghesuindu-se pe Drumul Archway de pe străzile întunecate ale Holloway, Islington şi Clerkenwell, şi a urmărit bucuria ascuţită a copiilor şi a familiilor. ----<br/><br/>Comisarii ecleziastici dețin aproape o treime din marea parohie din Hornsey. Prin cheltuirea liberală a banilor contribuabililor pentru deschiderea drumurilor şi pentru dezvoltarea generală a districtului, valoarea proprietăţii lor a crescut enorm, iar din această creştere necâştigătoare ei obţin în fiecare an venituri mari. Cu siguranţă, contribuabilii ai căror bani au ajutat astfel la crearea imensei moşii se pot aştepta la un tratament liberal în schimb.<br/><br/>Al tău ascultător,<br/><br/>Semnat de Vicarul St James, Muswell Hill, ministrul Capelei Park, Crouch End, un avocat care locuiește în Grădinile Onslow și trei membri ai Consiliului Districtual.<br/><br/>A fost o lovitură directă în arcul Comisarilor Ecleziastici. Propriii lor lideri religioşi şi Consiliul Districtual, toţi înarmaţi spunând în fapt că biserica era prea bogată şi ar trebui să fie caritabilă, nu lacomă. Includerea celor doi clerici a fost o mişcare vicleană. Amintiţi-vă că acest lucru a fost încă în vârful controversei Darwin. Darwin a împărțit credința în învățăturile Bisericii și mulți oameni ar fi resentit puterea Bisericii numai din acest punct de vedere. Biserica nu era atât de sigură pe cât se pretindea a fi.<br/><br/>The Evening News, 7 iunie 1895 a spus:<br/><br/>"Dacă nu sunt abordați imediat Comnușii Ecleziastici, caracatița de construcție va obține o aderență a lemnului care va fi foarte dificil de slăbit mai târziu, ---. Prin urmare, este necesar ca londonezii să se ridice și să facă dacă ar salva unul dintre cele mai delicioase bucăți de peisaj rustic. Ancheta publică este amânată pentru joia viitoare şi înainte de aceasta trebuie făcut ceva pentru a-i convinge pe comisari că cetăţenii Londrei nu vor tolera confiscarea unuia dintre locurile lor de joacă preferate.<br/><br/>O scrisoare din ziarul Daily Chronicle spunea a doua zi:<br/><br/>..... A fost cu mare uşurare că locuitorii, în urmă cu zece ani, au auzit că achiziţia Lemnului Superior a fost efectuată; şi cât de încântător a fost acest lucru, oricine i-a vizitat poate depune mărturie, dar toţi cei care s-au străduit să salveze aceste păduri superioare, care se află pe partea de vest a drumului Muswell Hill, au simţit că victoria lor a fost incompletă atât timp cât cei 60 acri de pe partea de estică. Este, ca și cum, un accident că pădurile sunt împărțite de un drum înalt larg. Poate cineva să se îndoiască care ar fi efectul dacă cimitirul de lemn de jos ar fi înlocuit cu rânduri de vile mici, fiecare trimițând contribuția sa de fum și funingine? Poate cineva să se îndoiască, de asemenea, de diferența serioasă pe care ar face-o pentru decorul pitoresc al pădurilor cumpărate dacă o linie de case noi cu privirea îndreptată spre fațada lor frunze?<br/><br/>Acest lucru a exprimat opiniile multor oameni. De fapt, pădurea de pietriș, pe care scriitorul o numește „pădurea superioară”, nu a fost cumpărată, ci a fost dată districtului de către Comisia Ecleziastică, un punct pe care trebuiau să-l repete de-a lungul anilor, dar cei mai mulți oameni l-au ignorat. Comisia nu avea de gând să cedeze un al doilea lemn, indiferent ce a spus cineva, şi a menţinut această poziţie până la sfârşit.<br/><br/>H.S.Chamberlain, de la 5 Cranley Gardens, într-o scrisoare către Times din 8 iunie 1895, a îndemnat la cumpărare.<br/><br/>Știu că este obișnuit să se vorbească aspru de Comisarii ecleziastici, dar ca administratori ai unui fond, ei sunt obligați să-l administreze în cel mai mare avantaj și, prin urmare, dacă ceva trebuie făcut pentru a salva în mod automat demolarea lemnului, mi se pare că poate fi efectuată numai prin cumpărarea proprietății de la Comnușienții, care știu că sunt pe deplin vii la protecția oamenilor liberi.<br/><br/>(Acest lucru se referă la câmpurile de joc Crouch End, care au fost asigurate câțiva ani mai târziu.)<br/><br/>În calitate de președinte al Asociației Conservatoare Muswell Hill, sunt în contact constant cu locuitorii și pot afirma în siguranță că fiecare persoană care locuiește în vecinătate ar face orice pentru a păstra.<br/><br/>(Tot ceea ce dorea personal era venitul caritabil pentru a-și susține săracii săi. El a cerut hectarul său de teren - nu mult cu siguranță - el credea că asigurarea comisarilor că lemnul nu era în pericol.)<br/><br/>"Muswell Hill Road a fost unul dintre cele mai bune din Hornsey și ar rămâne la fel de frumos, case sau nu case",<br/><br/>(și apoi a venit marea înflorire retorică.)<br/><br/>Săracii trebuie să sufere din cauza obiecţiilor sentimentale şi a strigătului isteric al lupului care tocmai a fost ridicat de corespondenţii voştri? Un acru de teren adăugat la proprietatea caritabilă nu ar face nicio diferență considerabilă pentru pământul rămas, în timp ce profitul care rezultă din aceasta ar ajuta mulți oameni săraci în vârstă și vrednici în anii lor de declin și ne-ar permite să predăm succesorilor noștri o proprietate care, în viitorul îndepărtat, ar fi de mare valoare în furnizarea de ajutor caritabil săracilor vrednici ai parohiei din Horn.<br/><br/>Citind scrisoarea sa se simte isterie foarte aproape de suprafață. De ce a crezut comisarii au vrut să construiască un drum? De ce ar cheltui toți acei bani dacă nu pentru a construi case? Niciodată nu părea să-şi dea seama că pentru un acru de pământ toată pădurea ar fi pierdută. Dar el a fost cu problema pentru o lungă perioadă de timp. El a fost persoana căreia Comisarii i-au făcut oferta de vânzare pentru 25.000 de lire sterline în urmă și este numele său care este onorat într-o placă pe Crouch End Clock Tower pentru salvarea lemnului, dar încrederea sa în Comisarii Ecleziastici pare naivă. Este trist că la anchetă trebuia să fie aruncat ca diavolul.<br/><br/>Ancheta a continuat<br/><br/>În 15 iunie 1895 s-a deschis la Highgate. În aşteptarea unei mari adunări, sala consiliului fusese schimbată complet. Tabelele obişnuite fuseseră îndepărtate şi camera umplută cu scaune. La ora şapte şi jumătate, camera era aglomerată, cu oameni care cereau locuri.<br/><br/>Dl Murray, comisarul, a declarat că ancheta a fost într-adevăr una simplă. Hornsey Parochial Charities a dorit să cumpere o bucată de teren adiacent proprietății lor de caritate din spate. Întrebarea era dacă Comisia de Caritate, care controla toate organizațiile de caritate, avea suficientă putere pentru a le opri. Comisarii Bisericii erau dispuşi să vândă pământul la condiţii foarte favorabile, iar veniturile Carităţii urmau să crească considerabil.<br/><br/>Împotriva acestui lucru au existat trei clase de obiecții.<br/><br/>Fondul inițial a fost în scopul de a oferi cabane pentru săraci, dar administratorii au propus să construiască vile care ar fi prea scump pentru săraci. Cu toate acestea, era în puterea administratorilor să varieze termenii Trustului, astfel încât să poată construi vile dacă credeau că săracii vor beneficia în cele din urmă. Oamenii săraci înșiși ar putea obiecta, dar prevederile liberale au fost deja promise pentru ei. A treia obiecție a fost legată de partea estetică și publică a problemei. El a luat din ceea ce a citit că Comisia de Caritate ar trebui să intervină pentru a împiedica comisarii ecleziastici să-și exercite propria discreție în tratarea propriei proprietăți.<br/><br/>Ancheta a discutat puncte fine, dar vorbitorii au continuat să se întoarcă la problema majoră a prevenirii oricărei distrugeri a lemnului. Vestry Clerk din Islington, reprezentând 300.000 de oameni, a făcut un protest formal împotriva oricărei părți a pădurii, atât de valoroasă pentru oamenii din Islington și Hornsey fiind folosită în scopuri private. Dl Wilfred White a declarat că, dacă comisarii le vor acorda timp, vor putea să strângă bani pentru a compensa administratorii.<br/><br/>Dl Beaumont a spus că nu vor vile, vor cabane pentru oamenii săraci care au fost alungați din cartier. Alții au spus că nu existau bani pentru a construi cabane pentru a le înlocui pe cele actuale, dar vile ar fi o propunere economică. Alții au răspuns că există o grămadă de vile de închiriat în Highgate. Lemnul era sacru. Rămâi la întrebarea despre lemn.<br/><br/>Dr. Fletcher a spus că strigătul printre muncitori a fost că nu era nicăieri unde să meargă. Muncitorii au venit la el cu strigătul: "Suntem alungați din Highgate și suntem obligați să mergem în Highgate New Town." Dacă faţada drumului Muswell Hill ar fi fost vândută, nu era nici o îndoială, dar că drumurile ar fi putut fi tăiate direct prin pădure în direcţia Hornsey, dar dacă comisarii nu ar fi putut obţine terenul de la Comisia de Caritate, nu ar fi putut tăia drumul.<br/><br/>El a fost foarte sigur că cabanele ar putea fi puse într-o stare aptă de reparații. El a fost rugat de săraci, de poliție și de o serie de clase muncitoare să reprezinte aceste două puncte, că cazare cabana a fost foarte necesar în Highgate și că, dacă au permis o dată terenul să fie vândut, nu se știe unde mâna constructorului ar fi rămas.<br/><br/>(Aplauze puternice și prelungite).<br/><br/>Mulți alți oameni au vorbit și Comnușierul a rezumat spunând că a considerat că opinia prevalentă este în favoarea păstrării cabanelor, dar întâlnirea nu ar trebui să tragă concluzii din ceea ce a spus (Gemete).<br/><br/>Alții au spus că administratorii carității au eșuat în îndatoririle lor, lăsând cabanele să cadă în defecțiune.<br/><br/>Domnul H.R. Williams, administratorul care a scris mai devreme ziarului, a spus că a avut cea mai bună autoritate ca Comisarii Bisericii să nu facă drumuri și să nu fie beneficiați nici măcar de o iotă din acțiunile Comisarilor de Caritate. Alții au fost mult mai puțin încrezători, iar întâlnirea s-a încheiat după aproape trei ore.<br/><br/>"Suntem confruntați cu faptul că în Highgate și Muswell Hill există un număr de persoane care doresc cimitirul Bottom Wood și nu vor fi fericiți până când nu îl vor obține - în timp ce nimeni nu pare dispus să cheltuiască un ban pentru a plăti pentru el. Toată lumea spune că ar fi un lucru bun să avem lemnul ca spațiu deschis, dar toată lumea crede că este datoria altcuiva să-l facă unul. Islington Vestry a "rezolvat" subiectul, dar Islington Vestry nu oferă un bănuț pentru achiziție. Nu există o problemă mai dificilă de rezolvat pentru comunitate sau pentru individ decât cum să obţii posesia proprietăţii altora fără să plăteşti pentru ea.<br/><br/>Plătirea pentru acest lucru a fost într-adevăr problema, deoarece Churchyyard Bottom Wood a devenit subiectul unei intense dezbateri locale și naționale. S-a format un comitet comun pentru a strânge bani pentru a salva lemnul. La 20 noiembrie 1896, C.F. Cory-Wright, onorabilul trezorier, a scris pentru The Standard, un ziar de la acea vreme, cerând ajutor. El a reamintit tuturor pericolul de a pierde lemnul și a spus că poate fi salvat numai prin cumpărarea acestuia. Comisarii Bisericii ar vinde pentru 25.000 de lire sterline și un extra (5.000 ar fi necesare pentru garduri și drenaj, ceea ce face un total de 30.000 de lire sterline. Acest lucru a fost prea mult pentru Consiliul Hornsey să ridice, dar au votat deja 10.000 de lire sterline pentru total. Pădurile erau de o valoare inestimabilă pentru tot nordul Londrei, așa că a făcut apel la organismele publice și la persoanele private să ridice restul de 20.000 de lire sterline. El a avertizat că oferta actuală din partea Comisarilor Bisericii a fost deschisă numai până la sfârșitul anului 1898. După aceea, constructorii s-au mutat înăuntru.<br/><br/>Apelul a fost călduros primit de presă. Un proiect de lege privat a fost grăbit prin Parlament și Highgate Woods Preservation Act, 1897, a devenit lege. Conunittee a avut acum dreptul de a face publicitate pentru contribuții la cumpărarea și conservarea lemnului.<br/><br/>Într-un timp destul de scurt, aproape toți banii au fost strânși, dar ultimele mii s-au dovedit a fi foarte dificil de strâns, iar termenul limită al comisarilor a fost o chestiune de săptămâni. Dl Cory-Wright a scris cererea pentru mai mult timp, dar i s-a acordat doar trei luni și apoi numai în cazul în care dobânzile la 4% au fost plătite pentru perioada suplimentară din întreaga sumă. În cele din urmă, Consiliul Județean din Londra, care a oferit inițial 2.500 de lire sterline, a făcut acest lucru până la 5.000 de lire sterline și totalul a fost atins, dar a fost un lucru de aproape.<br/><br/>Consiliul a decis să redenumească pădurea ca "Pădurea Reginei", în onoarea Jubileului de Diamant al Reginei Victoria, iar Hornsey a făcut o frumoasă demonstrație de frumusețe atunci când Ducesa de Albany a declarat în mod oficial pădurea deschisă "pentru uzul liber al publicului pentru totdeauna".<br/><br/>În timp ce campania pentru salvarea Churchyard Bottom Wood a fost condusă și condusă de localnici care au simțit cu pasiune această bucată de pădure, au apelat la ajutorul și experiența unei vaste rețele de oameni, dintre care unii au lucrat împreună la campanii similare de peste treizeci de ani. Comitetul a emis un apel, tipărit pe hârtie de foarte bună calitate și cu câteva nume celebre.<br/><br/>Problemele spațiului deschis și ale sănătății publice au fost subiecte majore ale viziunii victoriene.<br/><br/>Mișcarea Spații Deschise<br/><br/>Octavia Hill, marele reformator al locuințelor, care începuse cu trei case vechi din Marylebone, cumpărate pentru ea de Jolm Ruskin, devenise rapid expert în adăpostirea săracilor în cele mai sănătoase condiții posibile. Calea ei a fost să cumpere chirii și apoi să doboare unele dintre casele aglomerate pentru a aduce lumină și aer pentru restul, crezând că aerul proaspăt și lumina soarelui erau singurul mod în care oamenii săraci puteau fi salvați de la febra putredă. Ea a învățat acest lucru în copilărie de la bunicul ei, Southwood Smith, care și-a dezvoltat teoriile la Spitalul Fever din King's Cross.<br/><br/>El a construit primele locuințe industriale pentru oamenii săraci și a dovedit statistic că un aer bun și un drenaj decent au salvat vieți. Gibson Gardens, în Northwold Road, este un rezultat direct al ideilor lui Southwood Smith. Mai multe informații despre Gibson Gardens<br/><br/>Importanța aerului deschis<br/><br/>Spațiile deschise și posibilitatea de a respira aer curat, au fost esențiale pentru oamenii care trăiesc într-una sau două camere aglomerate. Octavia Hill a luat-o de la Lisson Grove mahalale, pe Fitzjohn's Avenue la Hampstead Heath. Ea a iubit atât de mult câmpurile de pe Fitzjohn's Avenue încât a încercat să le cumpere ca un parc public. Acestea trebuiau să coste 10.000 de lire sterline și în termen de trei săptămâni din august au fost ridicate 8.500 de lire sterline. A fost nevoie doar de sfârșitul vacanțelor de vară și de întoarcerea din vacanță a prietenilor simpatici și de alte 1.500 de lire sterline ar fi fost ridicate, dar proprietarii și-au retras brusc oferta. În ciuda tuturor pledoariilor, câmpurile au fost acoperite cu case mari.<br/><br/>Din aceasta s-a dezvoltat campania de salvare a Dealului Parlamentului, următorul spațiu deschis spre nord de Lisson Grove, achiziționând câmpuri în calea constructorilor pentru a face un cordon sanitarre permanent împotriva cărămizilor care avansau. Campania Parliament Hills Fields a fost atât de reușită încât a fost adoptată Legea Hampstead Heath și au existat bani din apel. Din acești bani și din impulsul spre spații deschise, a fost să se dezvolte Trustul Național. Octavia Hill a fost interesată de protejarea zonelor, cum ar fi Wood Bottom Church, de ani de zile, așa că a fost un aliat natural în lupta pentru salvarea Wood.<br/><br/>Societatea de Conservare a Comunelor, de asemenea, era familiarizată cu acest tip de agitație și colectare de bani. Ei au dărâmat gardurile atunci când stăpânii conacului au închis bucăți de teren comun, ducând bătălii atât legale, cât și ilegale împotriva privatizării arogante a terenurilor în mod tradițional libere. Robert Hunter, Solicitantul lor de Onoare din 1868, a fost întotdeauna preocupat de asigurarea spațiilor deschise, mari sau mici, pentru public. El, acum Sir Robert Hunter, a devenit președintele Apelului de jos al Bisericii. Președintele Societății de Prezervare a Comunelor a fost dl Shaw-Lefevre (mai târziu Lord Eversley) care a jucat un rol important în această și alte campanii în Camera Comunelor. Octavia Hill a fost implicată în munca lor din jurul anului 1875.<br/><br/>În același timp, Octavia Hill făcea campanie pentru un proiect de lege privind înmormântarea.<br/><br/>Bisericile din oraş deveniseră atât de aglomerate şi un pericol atât de grav pentru sănătate, prin contaminarea fântânilor din care oamenii îşi scoteau apa potabilă, încât înmormântările în oraş nu mai erau permise, ci cimitirele erau create la periferia oraşului. Cimitirul Abney Park a fost unul dintre acestea. A existat apoi o mișcare pentru a îndepărta pietrele de mormânt de la marginile cimitirelor orașului vechi, pentru a re-îngropa cadavrele în altă parte și pentru a transforma cimitirele în grădini și spații deschise, în loc să se construiască pe ele. Acest teren din centrul Londrei era foarte valoros și speculanții erau dornici să-l obțină: chiar și Quakerii au construit pe unul dintre cimitirele lor și au amenințat că o vor face din nou, construind pe Bunhill Fields. Octavia Hill a avut o rețea de aliați în o duzină de câmpuri, așa că ajutorul ei pentru a salva pădurea de jos a Bisericii trebuie să fi fost de neprețuit.<br/><br/>Societatea Grădinilor Metropolitane, înființată în 1882, a amenajat aproximativ două sute de grădini mici în centrele orașului până în 1890. Mai târziu, acestea au fost predate autorităților locale, astfel încât sprijinul lor pentru Apelul Bisericii Cimitirului Bottom Wood a fost asigurat de la început.<br/><br/>Societatea Kyrle este uitată acum, dar în zilele sale a avut o mare influență asupra legislației urbane și a spațiului deschis. Societatea a fost înființată în jurul anului 1875 pentru „difuzarea frumuseții”, pentru a aduce culoarea și interesul în viața oamenilor care trăiesc în medii plictisitoare și murdare. Culoare strălucitoare pe pereți și decorațiuni, cântec bun, spații deschise, natură, literatură și artă. Era o ramură decorativă, pentru care William Morris ţinea prelegeri; o ramură muzicală pentru a promova corurile şi serile fericite pentru oamenii din clădirile şcolilor locale; şi o ramură a literaturii. Societatea a făcut apel în mod regulat prin scrisori în The Times, la „clasele mai bogate” pentru ca cărțile și periodicele să fie distribuite cluburilor băieților și fetelor, caselor de pomană și în altă parte. Numele Kyrle provine din cartea lui Pope, Omul lui Ross, filantropul care și-a dat locul de naștere oamenilor ca un parc public. |
| With Thanksgiving around the corner, here are some festive file folder games we made for the girls. Both Thanksgiving games focus on math skills. And I'm grateful once again to my husband, Ed, for making all the clipart for me.<br/><br/>Thanksgiving Pattern Making<br/><br/>Like the name says, this game is about making patterns. Little ones just learning about patterns, can simply match the pictures onto the pattern strips, while others can continue the pattern with the picture cards on the blank strips.<br/><br/>To make the file folder, you want to cut out the grid of pictures to make the card pieces. I recommend laminating them to help them last longer. Then glue the pattern strips down on the file folder.<br/><br/>I wanted to have the blank pattern strips too so that the girls could see where to continue the pattern and how many to lay out. I attached them to the side of the folder using tape so that they could fold in to pack up the game and extend to layout the pattern.<br/><br/>I also added an extra blank one so that the girls could make their own pattern as well.<br/><br/>Turkey Number Game<br/><br/>In this game the girls add the feathers to the turkey body while practicing counting and number recognition. I used the colorless feathers to act as a guide for where to add the feathers and so that the girls could match the numbers. And be sure when gluing down the turkey body you only glue in the center so that the wing pieces can slide under the body.<br/><br/>Once all the feathers are laid out, we practice some simple arithmetic, such as taking away three feathers and seeing how many are left then adding two back to see what it equals.<br/><br/>In addition to black and white wings, we also included a colorless turkey in case you want to have the little ones color their own set. Instead of a file folder game you can turn this into a craft, coloring the pieces, cutting them out, and gluing them together.<br/><br/>Another option is to use the pieces to make a felt board story. We sometimes sing a turkey version of 10 Little Indians:<br/><br/>Like this:<br/><br/>Who Am I?<br/><br/>I think this is where I'm suppose to say something witty about myself. Oh well. I'm a stay-at-home mom to three awesome kids--our twin daughters who are seven now and a two-year-old son who is full of energy. In my pre-children life I was a teacher and I now homeschool our children. I'm also married to Ed, who is currently serving in the Air Force, and is the love of my life (it'd be awkward if he wasn't). Our family is big on books, crafts, and having fun together. I just thought I would share our activities in my own little corner of the internet.<br/><br/>Zoe appears to have it all--rich, handsome husband, easy New York life--but she made mistakes in her past and those mistakes are coming back up in her new life. I found myself on the edge of my seat for most of the book and was surprised...<br/><br/>I loved this book, I love the story, and I am grateful Margot Shetterly brought it to light. My only complaint was that I wished she discussed Katherine Johnson's role in the later missions a bit more but I guess the story had to end som...<br/><br/>I wanted to like this book and I did throughout most of it. Dana finds out her estranged husband and his girlfriend are found dead in the New Mexico desert. I was immediately drawn in by her character and the story. I really enjoyed seei... | Cu Ziua Recunoștinței după colț, iată câteva jocuri de dosare festive pe care le-am făcut pentru fete. Ambele jocuri de Ziua Recunoștinței se concentrează pe abilitățile matematice. Și sunt recunoscător încă o dată soțului meu, Ed, pentru a face toate clipart-urile pentru mine.<br/><br/>Ziua Recunoștinței model de a face<br/><br/>După cum spune și numele, acest joc este despre a face modele. Cei mici doar învățând despre modele, pot potrivi pur și simplu imaginile pe benzile de model, în timp ce alții pot continua modelul cu cărțile de imagine pe benzile goale.<br/><br/>Pentru a face dosarul de fișiere, doriți să tăiați grila de imagini pentru a face bucățile de carduri. Recomand laminarea lor pentru a le ajuta să dureze mai mult. Apoi lipiți benzile de model în jos pe dosarul de fișiere.<br/><br/>Am vrut să am și benzile goale, astfel încât fetele să poată vedea unde să continue modelul și câte să arate. Le-am atașat la partea laterală a dosarului folosind bandă astfel încât să poată plia pentru a împacheta jocul și să se extindă pentru a aranja modelul.<br/><br/>Am adăugat, de asemenea, unul în plus alb, astfel încât fetele să-și poată face propriul model.<br/><br/>Turcia Număr Joc<br/><br/>În acest joc fetele adaugă penele la corpul de curcan în timp ce practica numărătoarea și recunoașterea numerelor. Am folosit penele incolore pentru a acționa ca un ghid pentru unde să adauge penele și astfel încât fetele să poată potrivi numerele. Și asigurați-vă că atunci când lipiți corpul de curcan, lipiți numai în centru, astfel încât bucățile de aripi să poată aluneca sub corp.<br/><br/>Odată ce toate penele sunt așezate, practicăm o aritmetică simplă, cum ar fi să luăm trei pene și să vedem câte mai rămân, apoi să adăugăm două pentru a vedea ce înseamnă.<br/><br/>În plus față de aripile alb-negru, am inclus, de asemenea, un curcan incolor în cazul în care doriți să aveți cei mici de culoare propriul set. În loc de un joc de dosare de fișiere, puteți transforma acest lucru într-o meserie, colorarea pieselor, tăierea lor, și lipirea lor împreună.<br/><br/>O altă opțiune este de a folosi piesele pentru a face o poveste de pâslă. Uneori cântăm o versiune de curcan a 10 Little Indians:<br/><br/>Cum ar fi:<br/><br/>Cine sunt eu?<br/><br/>Cred că aici ar trebui să spun ceva amuzant despre mine. Oh, ei bine. Sunt o mamă acasă la trei copii minunați - fiicele noastre gemene care au șapte ani acum și un fiu de doi ani care este plin de energie. În viața mea de dinainte de copii am fost profesor și acum ne învăț copiii acasă. Sunt, de asemenea, căsătorit cu Ed, care servește în prezent în Forțele Aeriene, și este dragostea vieții mele (ar fi ciudat dacă nu ar fi). Familia noastră este mare pe cărți, meșteșuguri, și să se distreze împreună. M-am gândit doar că aș împărtăși activitățile noastre în propriul meu colț mic de internet.<br/><br/>Zoe pare să aibă totul - soț bogat, frumos, viața ușoară din New York - dar ea a făcut greșeli în trecutul ei și acele greșeli revin în noua ei viață. M-am găsit pe marginea scaunului meu pentru cea mai mare parte a cărții și a fost surprins ...<br/><br/>Mi-a plăcut această carte, îmi place povestea, și sunt recunoscătoare Margot Shetterly a adus-o la lumină. Singura mea plângere a fost că mi-aș fi dorit să discute rolul Katherine Johnson în misiunile ulterioare un pic mai mult, dar cred că povestea a trebuit să se termine atât de mult ...<br/><br/>Am vrut să-mi placă această carte și am făcut-o în cea mai mare parte a ei. Dana descoperă soțul ei înstrăinat și prietena lui sunt găsite moarte în deșertul New Mexico. Am fost imediat atras de caracterul ei și povestea. Mi-a plăcut foarte mult ... |
| Alcohol use by persons under age 21 has been identified as a major public health problem. Studies note that it increases the risks for disability, and may be detrimental to the developing brain. Minors who drink are more likely to commit suicide, break the law, or be victims of violence. Alcohol is implicated in nearly one-third of youth traffic fatalities. The total annual cost of underage drinking is estimated at $62 billion. While most laws intended to prevent underage drinking are passed at the state level, there has been legislative activity and interest at the federal level to support states' efforts to curb the problem. This report describes the extent of underage alcohol use, recent legislative activity on this issue, and various policy implications. It will be updated as new data become available. | Consumul de alcool de către persoanele cu vârsta sub 21 de ani a fost identificat ca o problemă majoră de sănătate publică. Studiile notează că crește riscurile de dizabilitate și poate fi dăunătoare pentru creierul în curs de dezvoltare. Minorii care beau sunt mai predispuși să se sinucidă, să încalce legea sau să fie victime ale violenței. Alcoolul este implicat în aproape o treime din decesele în traficul de tineri. Costul anual total al consumului de alcool al minorilor este estimat la 62 de miliarde de dolari. În timp ce majoritatea legilor menite să prevină consumul de alcool de către minori sunt adoptate la nivel de stat, au existat activități legislative și interes la nivel federal pentru a sprijini eforturile statelor de a reduce problema. Acest raport descrie amploarea consumului de alcool al minorilor, activitatea legislativă recentă pe această temă și diversele implicații politice. Acesta va fi actualizat pe măsură ce vor deveni disponibile noi date. |

It wasn't political lobbying or public petitioning that resulted in food reform, but rather a grassroots effort led by citizens with the power to actually implement and follow-through with change.<br/><br/>I ended the post alluding to one question: Why is it so hard for us to do this ourselves, as individuals? If an entire country can implement and spread a common view towards food, why can't we?<br/><br/>There's nothing really stopping us from mimicking Denmark's success. The problem is, we're inundated with so many messages about what we should be eating, and how we should be living, it's hard to know where to start. So rather than following successful frameworks that have been shown to work (like the Nordic Food Manifesto), most people jump from diet craze to diet craze, trying to find the "right way to eat."<br/><br/>But how did Claus Meyer succeed? What was the secret sauce that helped the Manifesto take hold? And is it reasonable to think we can apply those lessons to our own lives?

The unique outer crispiness of the meat gave way to a perfectly juicy interior, resulting in a sound more similar to slicing into a calzone than a ground beef patty.<br/><br/>We were sitting in Copenhagen's oldest pub, which felt more like a casual bistro than a bar, and I was about to try the dish recommended by our waitress/bar tender/proprietor?<br/><br/>"The Paris Beef, it's very good," she had said. "It's not from France… it's very Danish."<br/><br/>Sign me up!<br/><br/>Paris beef with fresh veggies and raw egg yolk at Rabes Have in Copenhagen | Tag Archives: alimente reale<br/><br/>Săptămâna trecută am scris despre Manifestul Alimentar Nordic și despre modul în care Danemarca a creat o cultură puternică a „alimentelor reale” în mare parte dintr-un efort intenționat condus de Claus Meyer. Nu lobby-ul politic sau petițiile publice au dus la o reformă a alimentației, ci mai degrabă un efort de bază condus de cetățeni cu puterea de a implementa și de a urmări schimbările.<br/><br/>Am terminat postarea făcând aluzie la o întrebare: De ce este atât de greu pentru noi să facem acest lucru singuri, ca indivizi? Dacă o țară întreagă poate implementa și răspândi o viziune comună asupra alimentelor, de ce nu putem?<br/><br/>Nimic nu ne împiedică să imităm succesul Danemarcei. Problema este că suntem inundați cu atât de multe mesaje despre ce ar trebui să mâncăm și cum ar trebui să trăim, e greu să știi de unde să începi. Deci, în loc să urmeze cadre de succes care s-au dovedit a funcționa (cum ar fi Manifestul Alimentar Nordic), majoritatea oamenilor sare de la mania dietei la mania dietei, încercând să găsească "modul corect de a mânca".<br/><br/>Dar cum a reușit Claus Meyer? Care a fost sosul secret care a ajutat Manifestul să preia controlul? Și este rezonabil să credem că putem aplica aceste lecții în propriile noastre vieți?

Crăciunea exterioară unică a cărnii a cedat loc unui interior perfect suculent, rezultând un sunet mai asemănător cu tăierea într-o calzone decât o aluat de vită măcinată.<br/><br/>Am stat în cel mai vechi pub din Copenhaga, care părea mai degrabă un bistro casual decât un bar, și eram pe cale să încerc mâncarea recomandată de chelnerița/barul nostru?<br/><br/>"Paris Beef, este foarte bun", a spus ea. "Nu este din Franța ... este foarte danez."<br/><br/>Înscrie-te!<br/><br/>Paris carne de vită cu legume proaspete și gălbenuș de ou crud la Rabes Have în Copenhaga |
