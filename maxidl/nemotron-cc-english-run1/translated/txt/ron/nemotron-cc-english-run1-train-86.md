| Leclaire<br/><br/>The historic Leclaire neighborhood, once referred to as Edwardsville's "suburb to the south," was founded as a cooperative community in 1890 and remained a separate village until annexed to the city of Edwardsville in 1934. Newspapers and magazines throughout the United States and Europe reported on the Leclaire experiment, particularly during the first 20 years of its existence. In 1979, due to its unique history, the former village was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.<br/><br/>Leclaire was founded by Nelson Oliver Nelson, a St. Louis plumbing manufacturer who, for many years, sought to advance the plight of the working class. Nelson wanted to improve working conditions for his employees and provide housing near the factories so workers and their families could easily participate in recreational and educational programs offered free of charge by the company. Prior to 1890, while still in St. Louis, the N. O. Nelson Company's manufacturing and distribution businesses began providing profit sharing along with educational and recreational opportunities. The Leclaire cooperative experiment would bring additional benefits.<br/><br/>When Nelson employees indicated they wanted to relocate to a rural location, company representatives approached leaders of small towns in several Missouri and Illinois communities near their St. Louis headquarters. They were looking for a suitable property to build new factories and a model village. South of Edwardsville they found a 125-acre tract of land with access to water, coal, and transportation. Local businessmen acted quickly to offer a financial incentive. In less than three weeks, the community raised a fund of $20,000 from individual contributions of between $1 and $1,000 to entice Nelson to choose Edwardsville for his enterprise.<br/><br/>City leaders had hoped to locate property inside the city limits of Edwardsville, but when no suitable site could be found, they were confident that the Nelson investment south of town would soon become a part of Edwardsville. Although Nelson fulfilled all the contingencies for construction and job creation in his contract, it would be 44 years before annexation to Edwardsville. Leclaire, bounded by Madison/Brown Avenues to the east, the railroad tracks to the west, Hadley/McKinley Avenues on the south and Wolf Street to the north, remained an independent village from 1890 to 1934. During that time it earned a reputation for innovations in business, education and residential planning.<br/><br/>The village of Leclaire on a 1931 map of Edwardsville<br/>Courtesy of Paul Jenkins<br/><br/>Nelson's decision to build a village was not made on a whim. By the late 1880s he was an international leader in the fields of cooperation and profit-sharing, exchanging social theories with others around the world while expanding his St. Louis business. He named his experimental village after the Parisian profit-sharer, Edme Jean Leclaire, but he visited many other social visionaries who provided information and inspiration. Compiling the best ideas from these examples, Nelson founded Leclaire to, in his words, "give work, promote intelligence, provide recreation, foster beauty, and make homes." These were all factors he determined necessary for men to lead fulfilling lives. Later writers used these words to formulate Leclaire's founding principles: Work, Homes, Education, Recreation, and Beauty, but with the additional important principle of Freedom.<br/><br/>Work<br/><br/>Work could be considered the most important of these factors since without the factory jobs in Leclaire, there would be no village. The brick factory buildings were designed by architect E. A. Cameron to provide natural light, ventilation in the summer, and heated floors in the winter. There was a fire suppression system and, although industrial accidents were not eliminated, every effort was made to guarantee the safety of the workers. The ivy-covered brick buildings were surrounded by well-manicured lawns and flower gardens giving the complex a campus-like appearance. In 1894, New York World reporter Nellie Bly called the buildings "the ideal perfection of buildings for man to labor in".<br/><br/>The manufacturing complex of the N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company in Leclaire<br/>From Friends of Leclaire<br/><br/>Nelson company policies were designed to protect the financial stability of employees. Workers could earn a share of the profits and have a voice in the company if they chose that option. The profit-sharing plan gave Nelson employees a pride of ownership that resulted in a supportive workforce. There were a few short-lived labor strikes over the years, but for the most part, labor problems were rare. Workers also had reasonable hours and competitive wages. There was a provident fund that provided for pensions and sick leave, as well as widow pensions if a worker died, whether or not the death was related to his employment.<br/><br/>Company headquarters for the N. O. Nelson Company (NONCO) remained in St. Louis, but all of the N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company was moved to Leclaire. The manufacturing company was divided into shops that made a variety of products. In 1900, the shops became independent companies for tax purposes, but all were still owned by the N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company. The shops included the Cabinet Mill where wood products from cabinetry to millwork were produced. The skilled craftsmen that worked here also fulfilled special contracts, including teller cages for a local bank and an altar still in use at St. Andrew's Episcopal Church in Edwardsville. The Marble Shop specialized in architectural marble that was cut and installed by Nelson crews in homes, businesses, and even state capitols throughout the Midwest. The Machine Shop, which became Bignall and Keeler, made pipe fitting machines, pumps, gauges, and various mechanical tools expected in the plumbing trade. They also branched out to manufacture specialty items like the Leclaire Bicycle in the mid-1890s. The Brass Shop included a foundry where various plumbing pipes and tools were manufactured. These examples represent just some of the work done in the Leclaire factories. The company's logo was a stylized "NONCO" that can still be seen on plumbing fixtures and some fire hydrants in Edwardsville today.<br/><br/>Homes<br/><br/>Before homes could be built, housing was needed for workers who were completing the factory buildings as well as building homes. To meet those needs, the company built the "Club House," a large building that served many purposes. In addition to lodging, it was the community's first educational building, and it contained a well-stocked library.<br/><br/>Construction of the residential portion of Leclaire began immediately after the village was founded in June of 1890. Julius Pitzman, the innovative landscape architect who laid out the first lots in Leclaire, set them up with a number of protective covenants. The covenants provided for wide, curvilinear streets, large lots, and a deed restriction that limited the properties to residential or educational purposes only. The company paved the streets, provided electric street lights, installed sidewalks, and planted hundreds of trees along the streets of Leclaire. Later sections of Leclaire were laid out with a conventional grid design and smaller lots, but still included the deed restrictions.<br/><br/>A Leclaire Victorian cottage in 1907<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Initially the homes were built by the company and then sold at near cost to Nelson employees to encourage home ownership. If a worker became ill and could not make his mortgage, payments were suspended until after he returned to work. The homes were offered in a variety of house designs and the company advertised that no two dwellings were alike. The earliest homes were primarily Victorian cottages that came with electricity and running water. These were followed by bungalows, foursquares, and even some kit homes. Residents could purchase a company-built home or buy an empty lot and build a house themselves, provided the architectural design met company standards.<br/><br/>In later years, lots were sold to investors, usually Edwardsville residents, and many homes in the 1920s were built by local contractors who then sold them to area residents.<br/><br/>Education<br/><br/>Nelson believed in education for everyone, including the working class. Educational programming began with a kindergarten at the Club House in 1892 and continued in the new educational building at 722 Holyoake Road. Commonly called the "School House," this building provided a large hall for meetings and programs, but had moveable partitions to divide it into classroom space during the day. In the evenings, there were dances, meetings, or programs of the Leclaire Self-Culture Club which featured weekly lectures by Washington University professors or nationally known speakers who, like N. O. Nelson, were part of the social betterment movement at the turn of the century. These included Jane Addams, Edward Everett Hale, Samuel "Golden Rule" Jones, and author Charlotte Perkins Gilman, among others.<br/><br/>Children enrolled in the Leclaire kindergarten in 1913<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>In the ten years following the 1895 construction of the education building, there were a series of educational experiments including an industrial school, college, night school, and an academy. The earliest and longest-lived endeavor was the morning kindergarten, founded in 1892, that used the Fröbel Model. This two-year program was free to everyone, including Edwardsville children, until 1931 when for financial reasons the company began charging tuition to students who were not the children of employees. Nelson Manufacturing operated a kindergarten until 1934 when the building was turned over to the Edwardsville School District for a nominal fee.<br/><br/>Recreation<br/><br/>Boaters on Leclaire Lake in 1915<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Recreation was an important feature of Leclaire. The company provided sports facilities for baseball, tennis, and later, football. A bowling and billiard hall was constructed and there was a lake for boating, swimming, fishing, or ice skating in winter. Leclaire Park was furnished with boathouses, male & female bath houses, and a large pavilion. Residents organized dances, hayrides, spelling bees, and other activities, and the company sponsored a band that played regularly at entertainments in the village or in Edwardsville. Like the educational functions at the Club House and School House, the recreational facilities at Leclaire were open to all and were often a destination for Edwardsville and even St. Louis visitors.<br/><br/>Beauty<br/><br/>Early photograph of Leclaire Lake<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>The last of the factors Nelson deemed important for a satisfying life concerned the environment. Nelson knew about the importance of healthy living. He valued the beauty and cleanliness that could be found in the country, and encouraged all in Leclaire to beautify their property by planting gardens and orchards. Nelson himself led by example, so a company greenhouse provided free flowers and competitions were held for the most beautiful yards. Leclaire was laid out so that the entire village had a park-like setting still evident today.<br/><br/>Freedom<br/><br/>The Leclaire Cooperative store<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Nelson listed five founding principles for Leclaire, but modern writers add a sixth: Freedom. All of the programs offered by the company were available to employees as well as local residents, but none were mandatory. The freedom to choose whether or not to participate in company programs was entirely up to the individual. Residents of Leclaire could work for Nelson Manufacturing or elsewhere, and workers were under no obligation to live in Leclaire. Participation in recreational and educational programs was also optional. There was also a company store where employees could shop, but unlike other company towns, no one was in debt to the company store. The Leclaire Store was a cooperative where members were charged fair market prices, but were then paid quarterly dividends.<br/><br/>A Different Company Town<br/><br/>All of these benefits made Leclaire unique from other company towns. But there were also individual instances where the company showed compassion and care for the employees. The company closed the factories and hired excursion trains to take workers and their families to St. Louis for a day at the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair. When money was tight, Nelson would occasionally place extra cash in each pay envelope to make life easier for workers, and if he instituted a program the men did not agree with, they talked it out and, as often as not, Nelson would reverse himself.<br/><br/>Born in Lillesand, Norway, in 1841, N. O. Nelson was a complicated man. He was a capitalist who believed in free enterprise, but also a socialist, a follower of the "Golden Rule", and a patriot who served for the Union in the Civil War. By 1900, he was a multimillionaire, but by the time of his death in 1922, he had given it all away for the betterment of the working class.<br/><br/>Although Leclaire was not Nelson's only social experiment, it is considered his most successful endeavor. Other major efforts for social betterment included a chain of co-operative grocery stores in New Orleans, a kindergarten for the children of black employees in his Bessemer, Alabama, factories, and a home for consumptives in Indio, California.<br/><br/>Nelson's Village of Leclaire was renowned internationally as a noteworthy and successful experiment. It was described in the New York World on numerous occasions but in particular by reporter Nellie Bly in 1894 who wrote at length about the model town where "The labor question is solved and everybody happy in a little village near St. Louis." The Los Angeles Times also regularly reported on N. O. Nelson, as did the Chicago Daily Tribune and numerous other publications.<br/><br/>In a speech at Leclaire's 15th anniversary celebration in 1915, Nelson said, "Leclaire extends to you a wide open hospitality, and bids you enjoy today the ease and comfort and beauty and inspiration which we enjoy every day." More than a century has passed since that day, but the invitation still stands. Residents and researchers are invited to learn about Leclaire's history and consider the lessons that might be learned for the betterment of future generations.<br/><br/>One of the former buildings of the manufacturing complex in 2019, which now serves as the N. O. Nelson Campus of Lewis and Clark Community College<br/>Photo by Ben Ostermeier<br/><br/>Friends of Leclaire, organized in 1990 following Leclaire's Centennial celebration, promotes the history of Leclaire through a website (historic-leclaire.org), publications, and a festival, Leclaire Parkfest, held annually on the third Sunday in October | Leclaire<br/><br/>Cartierul istoric Leclaire, denumit odată „suburbia sudică” a lui Edwardsville, a fost fondat ca o comunitate cooperativă în 1890 și a rămas un sat separat până când a fost anexat orașului Edwardsville în 1934. Ziarele și reviste din Statele Unite și Europa au relatat despre experimentul Leclaire, în special în primii 20 de ani de existență. În 1979, datorită istoriei sale unice, fostul sat a fost inclus în Registrul Național al Locurilor Istorice.<br/><br/>Leclaire a fost fondată de Nelson Oliver Nelson, un producător de instalații sanitare din St. Louis care, timp de mulți ani, a căutat să avanseze situația dificilă a clasei muncitoare. Nelson a vrut să îmbunătățească condițiile de muncă pentru angajații săi și să ofere locuințe în apropierea fabricilor, astfel încât lucrătorii și familiile lor să poată participa cu ușurință la programele recreative și educaționale oferite gratuit de companie. Înainte de 1890, în timp ce era încă în St. Louis, afacerile de producție și distribuție ale N. O. Nelson Company au început să ofere partajarea profiturilor, împreună cu oportunități educaționale și recreative. Experimentul cooperativ Leclaire ar aduce beneficii suplimentare.<br/><br/>Când angajații lui Nelson au indicat că doresc să se mute într-o locație rurală, reprezentanții companiei s-au apropiat de liderii orașelor mici din mai multe comunități din Missouri și Illinois, în apropierea sediului lor din St. Louis. Ei căutau o proprietate potrivită pentru a construi noi fabrici și un sat model. La sud de Edwardsville au găsit un teren de 125 de acri cu acces la apă, cărbune și transport. Oamenii de afaceri locali au acționat rapid pentru a oferi un stimulent financiar. În mai puțin de trei săptămâni, comunitatea a strâns un fond de 20.000 de dolari din contribuții individuale între 1 și 1.000 de dolari pentru a-l atrage pe Nelson să aleagă Edwardsville pentru întreprinderea sa.<br/><br/>Liderii orașului sperau să găsească proprietăți în interiorul limitelor orașului Edwardsville, dar când nu a putut fi găsit un loc potrivit, au fost încrezători că investiția Nelson la sud de oraș va deveni în curând o parte din Edwardsville. Deși Nelson a îndeplinit toate contingențele pentru construcții și crearea de locuri de muncă în contractul său, ar fi trebuit să treacă 44 de ani înainte de anexarea la Edwardsville. Leclaire, limitat de Madison/Brown Avenues la est, căile ferate la vest, Hadley/McKinley Avenues la sud și Wolf Street la nord, a rămas un sat independent din 1890 până în 1934. În acest timp, a câștigat o reputație pentru inovațiile în afaceri, educație și planificare rezidențială.<br/><br/>Satul Leclaire pe o hartă din 1931 a orașului Edwardsville<br/>Cuvânt cheie: Paul Jenkins<br/><br/>Până la sfârșitul anilor 1880, Nelson a fost un lider internațional în domeniul cooperării și al împărțirii profiturilor, schimbând teorii sociale cu alții din întreaga lume, în timp ce își extindea afacerea din St. Louis. El a numit satul său experimental după acționarul de profit parizian, Edme Jean Leclaire, dar a vizitat mulți alți vizionari sociali care au furnizat informații și inspirație. Compilând cele mai bune idei din aceste exemple, Nelson a fondat Leclaire pentru, în cuvintele sale, "a da muncă, a promova inteligența, a oferi recreere, a încuraja frumusețea și a face case". Acestea au fost toți factorii pe care i-a determinat necesari pentru ca bărbații să ducă o viață împlinită. Scriitorii de mai târziu au folosit aceste cuvinte pentru a formula principiile fondatoare ale lui Leclaire: Muncă, Case, Educație, Recreere și Frumusețe, dar cu principiul suplimentar important al Libertății.<br/><br/>Muncă<br/><br/>Munca ar putea fi considerată cel mai important dintre acești factori, deoarece fără locurile de muncă din fabrică în Leclaire, nu ar exista nici un sat. Clădirile fabricii de cărămidă au fost proiectate de arhitectul E. A. Cameron pentru a oferi lumină naturală, ventilație în timpul verii și pardoseli încălzite în timpul iernii. A existat un sistem de suprimare a incendiilor și, deși accidentele industriale nu au fost eliminate, au fost depuse toate eforturile pentru a garanta siguranța lucrătorilor. Clădirile din cărămidă acoperite cu iederă erau înconjurate de gazon și grădini de flori bine îngrijite, dând complexului un aspect asemănător campusului. În 1894, reporterul New York World Nellie Bly a numit clădirile "perfecțiunea ideală a clădirilor pentru ca omul să lucreze".<br/><br/>Complexul de producție al companiei N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company din Leclaire<br/>Prietenii lui Leclaire<br/><br/>Politicile companiei Nelson au fost concepute pentru a proteja stabilitatea financiară a angajaților. Muncitorii ar putea câștiga o parte din profituri și ar avea o voce în companie dacă ar alege această opțiune. Planul de împărțire a profiturilor a dat angajaților lui Nelson o mândrie de proprietate care a dus la o forță de muncă de sprijin. Au existat câteva greve ale forței de muncă de scurtă durată de-a lungul anilor, dar în cea mai mare parte, problemele de muncă au fost rare. Muncitorii aveau, de asemenea, ore rezonabile și salarii competitive. Exista un fond de pensii care prevedea pensii și concedii de boală, precum și pensii de văduvă în cazul în care un lucrător moare, indiferent dacă decesul a fost sau nu legat de locul său de muncă.<br/><br/>Sediul companiei pentru N. O. Nelson Company (NONCO) a rămas în St. Louis, dar toată N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company a fost mutată la Leclaire. Compania de producție a fost împărțită în magazine care făceau o varietate de produse. În 1900, magazinele au devenit companii independente în scopuri fiscale, dar toate erau încă deținute de N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company. Magazinele au inclus Cabinet Mill, unde au fost produse produse din lemn, de la dulap la moară. Meșterii calificați care au lucrat aici au îndeplinit, de asemenea, contracte speciale, inclusiv cuști de casierie pentru o bancă locală și un altar încă în uz la Biserica Episcopală Sf. Andrei din Edwardsville. Magazinul de marmură este specializat în marmură arhitecturală care a fost tăiată și instalată de echipajele lui Nelson în case, afaceri și chiar în capitalele de stat din Midwest. Magazinul de mașini, care a devenit Bignall și Keeler, a făcut mașini de montare a țevilor, pompe, manometre și diverse instrumente mecanice așteptate în comerțul cu instalații sanitare. De asemenea, s-au ramificat pentru a produce articole de specialitate, cum ar fi bicicleta Leclaire la mijlocul anilor 1890. Magazinul de alamă a inclus o turnătorie în care au fost fabricate diverse țevi și unelte de instalații sanitare. Aceste exemple reprezintă doar o parte din munca făcută în fabricile Leclaire. Logo-ul companiei a fost un "NONCO" stilizat care poate fi văzut încă pe instalații sanitare și unele hidrante de incendiu în Edwardsville astăzi.<br/><br/>Știri<br/><br/>Înainte de a putea fi construite case, era nevoie de locuințe pentru muncitorii care completau clădirile fabricii, precum și pentru a construi case. Pentru a răspunde acestor nevoi, compania a construit "Casa Clubului", o clădire mare care a servit multor scopuri. În plus față de cazare, a fost prima clădire educațională a comunității și conținea o bibliotecă bine aprovizionată.<br/><br/>Construcția porțiunii rezidențiale a orașului Leclaire a început imediat după ce satul a fost fondat în iunie 1890. Julius Pitzman, arhitectul peisagist inovator care a proiectat primele loturi în Leclaire, le-a întocmit cu o serie de alianțe de protecție. Legămintele prevedeau străzi largi, curvilinee, loturi mari și o restricție de proprietate care limita proprietățile doar la scopuri rezidențiale sau educaționale. Compania a pavat străzile, a furnizat lumini electrice, a instalat trotuare și a plantat sute de copaci de-a lungul străzilor din Leclaire. Secțiunile ulterioare ale Leclaire au fost aranjate cu un design de grilă convențional și loturi mai mici, dar au inclus totuși restricțiile de proprietate.<br/><br/>O cabană victoriană Leclaire în 1907<br/>Votează Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Inițial casele au fost construite de companie și apoi vândute la un cost apropiat angajaților Nelson pentru a încuraja proprietatea casei. În cazul în care un muncitor sa îmbolnăvit și nu a putut face ipoteca, plățile au fost suspendate până după ce s-a întors la locul de muncă. Casele au fost oferite într-o varietate de modele de case și compania a făcut publicitate că nu există două locuințe la fel. Primele case au fost în principal cabane victoriane care au venit cu electricitate și apă curentă. Acestea au fost urmate de bungalouri, pătrate și chiar unele case cu kit. Locuitorii puteau cumpăra o casă construită de companie sau puteau cumpăra un lot gol și construi ei înșiși o casă, cu condiția ca designul arhitectural să îndeplinească standardele companiei.<br/><br/>În anii ulterioari, loturile au fost vândute investitorilor, de obicei rezidenților din Edwardsville, iar multe case din anii 1920 au fost construite de contractori locali care apoi le-au vândut rezidenților din zonă.<br/><br/>Educație<br/><br/>Nelson credea în educație pentru toată lumea, inclusiv pentru clasa muncitoare. Programarea educațională a început cu o grădiniță la Club House în 1892 și a continuat în noua clădire educațională de la 722 Holyoake Road. Denumită în mod obișnuit "Casa Școlii", această clădire oferea o sală mare pentru întâlniri și programe, dar avea partiții mobile pentru a o împărți în spațiul de clasă în timpul zilei. Seara, au avut loc dansuri, întâlniri sau programe ale Clubului de Auto-Cultură Leclaire, care au prezentat prelegeri săptămânale ale profesorilor de la Universitatea Washington sau vorbitori cunoscuți la nivel național care, ca și N. O. Nelson, au făcut parte din mișcarea de îmbunătățire socială la începutul secolului. Printre aceștia s-au numărat Jane Addams, Edward Everett Hale, Samuel "Golden Rule" Jones și autoarea Charlotte Perkins Gilman, printre alții.<br/><br/>Copiii înscriși la grădinița Leclaire în 1913<br/>Votează Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>În cei zece ani care au urmat construcției clădirii educaționale din 1895, au existat o serie de experimente educaționale, inclusiv o școală industrială, colegiu, școală de noapte și o academie. Cea mai veche și mai longevivă activitate a fost grădinița de dimineață, fondată în 1892, care folosea modelul Fröbel. Acest program de doi ani a fost gratuit pentru toată lumea, inclusiv pentru copiii din Edwardsville, până în 1931, când, din motive financiare, compania a început să perceapă taxe de școlarizare pentru studenții care nu erau copiii angajaților. Nelson Manufacturing a operat o grădiniță până în 1934, când clădirea a fost predată districtului școlar Edwardsville pentru o taxă nominală.<br/><br/>Recreere<br/><br/>Călăreți pe Lacul Leclaire în 1915<br/>Votează Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Recreația a fost o caracteristică importantă a Leclaire. Compania a furnizat facilități sportive pentru baseball, tenis și, mai târziu, fotbal. A fost construită o sală de bowling și biliard și a existat un lac pentru navigație, înot, pescuit sau patinaj pe gheață în timpul iernii. Parcul Leclaire a fost amenajat cu case de băi, băi masculine și feminine și un pavilion mare. Locuitorii au organizat dansuri, hairide, albine ortografice și alte activități, iar compania a sponsorizat o formație care a cântat în mod regulat la divertismente în sat sau în Edwardsville. Ca și funcțiile educaționale de la Club House și School House, facilitățile de agrement de la Leclaire erau deschise tuturor și erau adesea o destinație pentru vizitatorii din Edwardsville și chiar din St. Louis.<br/><br/>Frumusețe<br/><br/>Fotografie timpurie a lacului Leclaire<br/>Votează Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Ultimul factor pe care Nelson l-a considerat important pentru o viață satisfăcătoare a fost mediul înconjurător. Nelson știa despre importanța unei vieți sănătoase. El a apreciat frumusețea și curățenia care puteau fi găsite în țară și i-a încurajat pe toți din Leclaire să-și înfrumusețeze proprietatea prin plantarea de grădini și livezi. Nelson însuși a dat exemplul, astfel încât o seră a companiei a oferit flori gratuite și au fost organizate concursuri pentru cele mai frumoase curți. Leclaire a fost așezat astfel încât întregul sat să aibă un cadru asemănător parcului încă evident astăzi.<br/><br/>Libertatea<br/><br/>Magazinul Cooperativ Leclaire<br/>Votează Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Nelson a enumerat cinci principii fondatoare pentru Leclaire, dar scriitorii moderni adaugă un al șaselea: Libertatea. Toate programele oferite de companie erau disponibile atât angajaților, cât și locuitorilor locali, dar niciunul nu era obligatoriu. Libertatea de a alege dacă să participe sau nu la programele companiei depindea în întregime de individ. Locuitorii din Leclaire puteau lucra pentru Nelson Manufacturing sau în altă parte, iar lucrătorii nu erau obligați să trăiască în Leclaire. Participarea la programele recreative și educaționale a fost, de asemenea, opțională. A existat, de asemenea, un magazin al companiei unde angajații puteau face cumpărături, dar, spre deosebire de alte orașe ale companiei, nimeni nu era îndatorat magazinului companiei. Magazinul Leclaire a fost o cooperativă în care membrii au fost taxați la prețuri echitabile de piață, dar apoi au fost plătite dividende trimestriale.<br/><br/>Un oraș diferit de companie<br/><br/>Toate aceste beneficii au făcut ca Leclaire să fie unic în alte orașe ale companiei. Dar au existat și cazuri individuale în care compania a arătat compasiune și grijă pentru angajați. Compania a închis fabricile și a angajat trenuri de excursie pentru a duce muncitorii și familiile lor la St. Louis pentru o zi la Târgul Mondial din 1904. Când banii erau limitați, Nelson punea ocazional bani în plus în fiecare plic de plată pentru a face viața mai ușoară pentru muncitori, iar dacă el instituia un program cu care bărbații nu erau de acord, ei vorbeau și, ori de câte ori nu, Nelson se inversa.<br/><br/>Născut în Lillesand, Norvegia, în 1841, N. O. Nelson a fost un om complicat. A fost un capitalist care credea în liberă întreprindere, dar și un socialist, un adept al "Regulii de Aur" și un patriot care a servit pentru Uniune în Războiul Civil. Până în 1900, el era multimilionar, dar până la moartea sa în 1922, el dăduse totul pentru ameliorarea clasei muncitoare.<br/><br/>Deși Leclaire nu a fost singurul experiment social al lui Nelson, este considerat cel mai de succes efort al său. Alte eforturi majore pentru îmbunătățirea socială au inclus un lanț de magazine alimentare cooperative din New Orleans, o grădiniță pentru copiii angajaților negri din Bessemer, Alabama, fabrici și o casă pentru consumabile din Indio, California.<br/><br/>Satul Leclaire al lui Nelson a fost renumit pe plan internațional ca un experiment remarcabil și de succes. A fost descrisă în New York World în numeroase ocazii, dar în special de reporterul Nellie Bly în 1894, care a scris în detaliu despre orașul model în care "Problema muncii este rezolvată și toată lumea este fericită într-un mic sat lângă St. Louis". Los Angeles Times a raportat în mod regulat despre N. O. Nelson, la fel ca Chicago Daily Tribune și numeroase alte publicații.<br/><br/>Într-un discurs ținut la aniversarea a 15 ani de Leclaire în 1915, Nelson a spus: "Leclaire vă oferă o ospitalitate deschisă și vă oferă să vă bucurați astăzi de ușurința, confortul, frumusețea și inspirația de care ne bucurăm în fiecare zi". A trecut mai mult de un secol de atunci, dar invitația rămâne valabilă. Locuitorii și cercetătorii sunt invitați să învețe despre istoria lui Leclaire și să ia în considerare lecțiile care ar putea fi învățate pentru îmbunătățirea generațiilor viitoare.<br/><br/>Una dintre fostele clădiri ale complexului de producție în 2019, care servește acum ca campus N.

Skype is a great option for schools/classes who aren't bringing in in-person authors, but who want to explore books and poetry, connect with an author, and ask one-on-one questions.<br/><br/>Cost<br/><br/>I offer 30-45-minute Zoom or Skype visits with schools for $125 per session (or $200 for two sessions happening within three hours in the morning or the afternoon; $325 for three sessions in one day; $425 for four sessions in one day). In each session, I try to get kids as actively involved as possible. No, it's not the same kind of connection as an in-person visit offers, but it can still be inspiring and motivating for kids!<br/><br/>What I Do<br/><br/>Each session for up to 50 students includes:<br/><br/>5 minutes of tech set-up<br/><br/>3 segments of 10ish-minutes each — You choose from:<br/><br/>How I became a writer<br/><br/>Writing this particular book (you choose which book I focus on)<br/><br/>Reading (I read some poems and kids help me read others)<br/><br/>Classroom presentation (your students put on a reading or performance for me—a very appreciative audience!)<br/><br/>Writing a poem together<br/><br/>Question and answer session<br/><br/>5 minutes of wrap-ups/goodbyes<br/><br/>I also chat with classes of pre-service teachers or groups of in-service teachers about poetry and writing.<br/><br/>Tips for a Great Virtual Visit<br/><br/>Tips for a Successful Virtual Visit<br/><br/>One of my goals for virtual school visits is to capture the interactivity that makes in-person visits successful and fun. But the truth is that sometimes it's tough to be virtually interactive! The timing might not sync up correctly, which makes reading together a challenge, and it's really hard for me to hear individual students unless they come up and speak directly into the microphone/computer. But after some trial and error, I've discovered some ways to have the best virtual visits possible. Here they are: 10 ways to make my visit with your students a great experience!<br/><br/>Before the Visit<br/><br/>Get kids as excited as possible about the visit. Visit my website with them. Read some of my books with them. Gather some questions students have for me. Anything you do ahead of time to make it feel like a BIG DEAL will go a long way toward student engagement.<br/><br/>Position the video camera or laptop with webcam so that I can see as much of the audience as possible. It's hard to assess student engagement when I can only see a couple of students.<br/><br/>Limit each group to 50 students. It's incredibly hard to engage large groups via video.<br/><br/>I'll move quickly from topic to topic or poem to poem. Please remind students that they'll need to listen closely to understand what's going on.<br/><br/>Occasionally, I do a little Reader's Theater with students. If I send you any scripted student parts ahead of time, print a copy for EACH session and cut into pieces, if needed.<br/><br/>During the Visit<br/><br/>When I discuss a book, if you have that printed book, please hold it up for students to see.<br/><br/>You are my proxy. I often can't call on students and hear individual replies. So, I might say, "We're going to get 3 ideas. Raise your hand if you have an idea." Then YOU take over, call on three students, and announce those answers to everyone in the room and to me.<br/><br/>Choose confident, outgoing students for scripted student parts (if I send any ahead of time). During my in-person school visits, I try to draw out some of the less confident students, but I've found that this doesn't work as well during virtual visits because I can't hear them.<br/><br/>Have students with speaking parts sit up front. When it's time, have them stand up and remind them to speak loudly.<br/><br/>In virtual visits, behavior management falls solely on you. I often can't see exactly what's going on, so do please step in as needed. If there's a big disruption, just ask me to hold on for a moment so that I don't chatter on while nobody's paying attention:>)<br/><br/>Feel free to take pictures of me on-screen and share on social media–even though pictures of me often look ridiculous because I'm making funny faces or something while I read!<br/><br/>If you have any questions at all, please just ask, either before or during the visit!<br/><br/>Scheduling a Virtual Session<br/><br/>Are you interested in scheduling a virtual visit with me? Just email me to set up a date, and we'll go from there | Vizite de autor prin zoom sau Skype<br/><br/>Sunt încântat să vizitez cu elevii dvs. prin Zoom sau Skype! Skype este o opțiune excelentă pentru școlile / clasele care nu aduc autori în persoană, dar care doresc să exploreze cărți și poezie, să se conecteze cu un autor și să pună întrebări unul-la-unu.<br/><br/>Costuri<br/><br/>Ofer vizite Zoom sau Skype de 30-45 de minute cu școlile pentru 125 $ pe sesiune (sau 200 $ pentru două sesiuni care au loc în termen de trei ore dimineața sau după-amiaza; 325 $ pentru trei sesiuni într-o singură zi; 425 $ pentru patru sesiuni într-o singură zi). În fiecare sesiune, încerc să implic cât mai activ copiii. Nu, nu este același tip de conexiune ca o vizită în persoană oferă, dar poate fi încă inspirator și motivant pentru copii!<br/><br/>Ce fac eu<br/><br/>Fiecare sesiune pentru până la 50 de studenți include:<br/><br/>5 minute de pregătire tehnică<br/><br/>3 segmente de 10 minute fiecare - alegeți din:<br/><br/>Cum am devenit scriitor<br/><br/>Scrierea acestei cărți particulare (tu alegi cartea pe care mă concentrez)<br/><br/>Lectură (am citit unele poezii și copiii mă ajută să citesc altele)<br/><br/>Prezentarea în clasă (studenții tăi au pus o lectură sau o performanță pentru mine – un public foarte apreciativ!)<br/><br/>Scriind o poezie împreună<br/><br/>Sesiune de întrebări și răspunsuri<br/><br/>5 minute de înfășurare/la revedere<br/><br/>De asemenea, vorbesc cu clase de profesori pre-serviciu sau grupuri de profesori în serviciu despre poezie și scriere.<br/><br/>Sfaturi pentru o vizita virtuala<br/><br/>Sfaturi pentru o vizita virtuala de succes<br/><br/>Unul dintre obiectivele mele pentru vizitele școlare virtuale este de a captura interactivitatea care face vizitele în persoană de succes și distracție. Dar adevărul este că uneori este greu să fii virtual interactiv! S-ar putea ca sincronizarea să nu fie corectă, ceea ce face ca citirea împreună să fie o provocare, și este foarte greu pentru mine să ascult studenții individuali dacă nu vin și vorbesc direct în microfon / computer. Dar după câteva încercări și erori, am descoperit câteva modalități de a avea cele mai bune vizite virtuale posibile. Iată-le: 10 modalități de a face vizita mea cu studenții tăi o experiență minunată!<br/><br/>Înainte de vizită<br/><br/>Obțineți copiii cât mai entuziasmați posibil despre vizita. Vizitați site-ul meu cu ei. Citiți câteva dintre cărțile mele cu ei. Adunați câteva întrebări pe care studenții le au pentru mine. Orice faci înainte de timp pentru a face să se simtă ca o afacere mare va merge un drum lung spre angajamentul studentului.<br/><br/>Poziționați camera video sau laptopul cu webcam, astfel încât să pot vedea cât mai mult din publicul posibil. Este greu să evaluați implicarea studenților atunci când pot vedea doar câțiva studenți.<br/><br/>Limitați fiecare grup la 50 de studenți. Este incredibil de greu să vă implicați în grupuri mari prin video.<br/><br/>Voi trece rapid de la subiect la subiect sau poezie la poezie. Vă rugăm să le reamintiți elevilor că vor trebui să asculte cu atenție pentru a înțelege ce se întâmplă.<br/><br/>Ocazional, fac un pic de Reader's Theater cu elevii. Dacă vă trimit orice piese scrise de elevi înainte de timp, imprimați o copie pentru fiecare sesiune și tăiați în bucăți, dacă este necesar.<br/><br/>În timpul vizitei<br/><br/>Când discut o carte, dacă aveți acea carte tipărită, vă rugăm să o țineți pentru ca elevii să o vadă.<br/><br/>Tu ești reprezentantul meu. Adesea nu pot chema studenții și să aud răspunsuri individuale. Deci, aș putea spune, "Vom obține 3 idei. Ridicați mâna dacă aveți o idee." Apoi tu preiei conducerea, chemi trei elevi, şi anunţi aceste răspunsuri tuturor celor din cameră şi mie.<br/><br/>Alegeți studenții încrezători, care ies pentru părțile elevilor scriptate (dacă trimit orice în avans). În timpul vizitelor mele școlare în persoană, încerc să atrag unii dintre elevii mai puțin încrezători, dar am descoperit că acest lucru nu funcționează la fel de bine în timpul vizitelor virtuale, deoarece nu-i pot auzi.<br/><br/>Când e timpul, pune-i să se ridice şi să le amintească să vorbească tare.<br/><br/>În vizitele virtuale, managementul comportamentului cade exclusiv pe tine. De multe ori nu pot vedea exact ce se întâmplă, așa că vă rugăm să interveniți după cum este necesar. Dacă există o întrerupere mare, doar cere-mi să țină pentru un moment, astfel încât să nu vorbesc pe timp ce nimeni nu acordă atenție:>)<br/><br/>Simțiți-vă liber să faceți poze cu mine pe ecran și să le împărtășiți pe rețelele de socializare – chiar dacă fotografiile mele arată adesea ridicole pentru că fac fețe amuzante sau ceva în timp ce citesc!<br/><br/>Dacă aveți întrebări, vă rugăm să întrebați, fie înainte, fie în timpul vizitei!<br/><br/>Programarea unei sesiuni virtuale<br/><br/>Sunteți interesat să programați o vizită virtuală cu mine? Doar trimiteți-mi un e-mail pentru a stabili o dată, și vom merge de acolo |

On the one hand it has prompted stigma and violence and on the other it has brought about constructive and supportive responses from various individuals and groups. A new book, Acting on HIV, edited by Prof. Dennis Francis, Dean of the Faculty of Education at the University of the Free State, looks at how drama can be used to promote vital social change as well as individual behavioural change.<br/><br/>Acting on HIV offers a systematic inquiry into drama as an approach to discuss HIV/AIDS and related attitudes and behaviours. The book is a scholarly text and includes the work of some twenty exceptionally creative authors. Contributing authors to the book include, amongst others, Proff. Hazel Barnes (University of the Witwatersrand), Rob Pattman (Stellenbosch University) and Yvonne Sliep from the University of KwaZulu-Natal.<br/><br/>"This project started in 2009 and has taken much of my time to bring together the work of exceptionally creative authors. The research that is communicated through the book is original and timely and makes a significant contribution to conversations about the role/s and significance of drama in addressing issues of HIV & AIDS," says Prof. Francis | Arhiva de știri<br/><br/>O nouă carte analizează modalitățile de abordare a provocărilor HIV<br/><br/>2011-11-29<br/><br/>Prof. Dennis Francis cu Marjorie Human care a proiectat coperta cărții, Acting on HIV.<br/><br/>Pandemia HIV a scos în evidență cele mai bune și cele mai rele rezultate la om în ceea ce privește răspunsul. Pe de o parte, a provocat stigmatizare și violență și, pe de altă parte, a provocat răspunsuri constructive și de susținere din partea diferitelor persoane și grupuri. O nouă carte, Acting on HIV, editată de Prof. Dennis Francis, Decan al Facultății de Educație a Universității Statului Liber, analizează modul în care drama poate fi folosită pentru a promova schimbări sociale vitale, precum și schimbări comportamentale individuale.<br/><br/>Acting on HIV oferă o anchetă sistematică asupra dramei ca o abordare pentru a discuta despre HIV / SIDA și atitudinile și comportamentele conexe. Cartea este un text academic și include munca a aproximativ douăzeci de autori excepțional de creativi. Printre autorii care au contribuit la carte se numără, printre alții, Prof. Hazel Barnes (Universitatea din Witwatersrand), Rob Pattman (Universitatea Stellenbosch) și Yvonne Sliep de la Universitatea din KwaZulu-Natal.<br/><br/>„Acest proiect a început în 2009 și mi-a luat mult timp să reunesc munca unor autori excepțional de creativi. Cercetarea care este comunicată prin intermediul cărții este originală și oportună și aduce o contribuție semnificativă la conversațiile despre rolul și semnificația dramei în abordarea problemelor HIV și SIDA ", spune Prof. Francis. |

| Storyworld Spotlight<br/><br/>25 years of Tomb Raider<br/><br/>Tomb Raider is one of the most recognizable entertainment properties in the world. Since Lara Croft's first videogame appearance in Tomb Raider (1996), her exploits as an adventurous and quick-witted explorer have resonated widely with players, earning her a place in the pantheon of great pop culture characters. For that reason we will be putting The World of Lara Croft in the Storyworld Spotlight from December 22, 2021 to March 6, 2022.<br/><br/>Crafting a Croft<br/><br/>Lara Croft was created by studio Core Design, in Derby (UK), in 1996. The studio was looking for a lead character for their upcoming a 3D adventure game for PlayStation 1. A game in a 3rd person perspective where players would see the main character in full throughout every scene.<br/><br/>As the game was about 'raiding mysterious tombs deep under pyramids,' the lead character would need to look adventurous, and have the brains to survive complex raiding missions. After some deliberation, Lara Croft was born, a young, upper-class and utterly British woman, who was as enigmatic and intelligent as she was tough and self-reliant.<br/><br/>Success and controversy<br/><br/>Tomb Raider (1996) was a breakaway success for Core Design, who quickly doubled down on building Tomb Raider 2 (1997) and 3 (1998). A big part of the success was attributed to the games' leading lady, who found admirers both with male and female players. This baffled critics who just saw Lara Croft as a sexist cartoon.<br/><br/>Explore The World of Lara Croft in Storyworld<br/><br/>This exhibition explores the successful franchise in-depth. It looks at the history of the games and why its leading lady resonates with so many people. It also dives into the mystery of what makes Tomb Raider games tick, from the deep world building to the clever puzzles and traps, and from fantastic enemy and monster designs to the character design of the legendary heroine.<br/><br/>After all, mysteries are there to explore, and have been for the past 25 years.<br/><br/>Tickets<br/><br/>Buy your tickets for Storyworld online with a start date and entry time from Wednesday December 22.

De la prima apariție a lui Lara Croft în Tomb Raider (1996), exploit-urile ei ca un explorator aventuros și rapid-inteligent au rezonat pe scară largă cu jucătorii, câștigându-i un loc în panteonul marilor personaje ale culturii pop. Din acest motiv, vom pune Lumea Larei Croft în centrul atenției Storyworld din 22 decembrie 2021 până în 6 martie 2022.<br/><br/>Crearea unui croft<br/><br/>Lara Croft a fost creată de studioul Core Design, în Derby (Marea Britanie), în 1996. Studioul căuta un personaj principal pentru viitorul lor joc de aventură 3D pentru PlayStation 1. Un joc într-o perspectivă a celei de-a treia persoane, în care jucătorii vor vedea personajul principal în întregime în fiecare scenă.<br/><br/>Deoarece jocul a fost despre "raid morminte misterioase adânc sub piramide", personajul principal ar trebui să arate aventuros și să aibă creierul pentru a supraviețui misiunilor complexe de raid. După o anumită deliberare, s-a născut Lara Croft, o femeie tânără, de clasă superioară și cu totul britanică, care era la fel de enigmatică și inteligentă ca și ea.<br/><br/>Succes și controversă<br/><br/>Tomb Raider (1996) a fost un succes pentru Core Design, care s-a dublat rapid la construirea Tomb Raider 2 (1997) și 3 (1998). O mare parte a succesului a fost atribuită doamnei de top a jocurilor, care a găsit admiratori atât cu jucători de sex masculin, cât și cu jucători de sex feminin. Acest lucru i-a uimit pe criticii care au văzut-o pe Lara Croft ca pe un desen animat sexist.<br/><br/>Explorați Lumea lui Lara Croft în Storyworld<br/><br/>Această expoziție explorează franciza de succes în profunzime.

| Real Estate Word of the Day: Option<br/><br/>Option: An agreement to keep open, for a set period, an offer to sell or lease real property. An option can be used, for example, to give the buyer time to resolve questions of financing, title, zoning and feasibility before committing the buyer to purchase. Options are frequently used in the land assemblage process. The option must be supported by its actual consideration, separate and independent of the purchase price of the property. Mere recital of consideration alone is not sufficient except in a lease-option in which the provisions of the lease are themselves sufficient consideration to support the option. An option merely creates a contractual right; it does not give the optionee any estate in the property. At the time the option is signed, the owner does not sell, nor does the buyer purchase, the property. Although the owner is obligated to sell if given notice by the buyer, the buyer is not obligated to purchase. An option to buy is also known as a call; an option to sell is known as a put. | Cuvântul imobiliar al zilei: opțiune<br/><br/>Opțiune: Un acord pentru a menține deschisă, pentru o perioadă stabilită, o ofertă de vânzare sau închiriere de proprietăți imobiliare. O opțiune poate fi utilizată, de exemplu, pentru a oferi cumpărătorului timp pentru a rezolva problemele de finanțare, titlu, zonare și fezabilitate înainte de a angaja cumpărătorul să cumpere. Opțiunile sunt frecvent utilizate în procesul de asamblare a terenurilor. Opțiunea trebuie să fie susținută de luarea în considerare efectivă, separată și independentă de prețul de achiziție al proprietății. Simplul considerent al contraprestației nu este suficient în sine, cu excepția unei opțiuni de leasing în care dispozițiile contractului de leasing sunt suficiente pentru a susține opțiunea. O opțiune creează pur și simplu un drept contractual; aceasta nu dă opțiunee nici o proprietate în proprietate. În momentul în care opțiunea este semnată, proprietarul nu vinde, nici cumpărătorul nu cumpără, proprietatea. Deși proprietarul este obligat să vândă dacă este notificat de cumpărător, cumpărătorul nu este obligat să cumpere. O opțiune de cumpărare este, de asemenea, cunoscut sub numele de un apel; o opțiune de vânzare este cunoscută sub numele de un put. |
| Benefits of Carotenoids for the Skin<br/><br/>Have you heard of carotenoids? These powerful phytochemicals are the pigmented constituents found in plants that give flowers, fruits, and leaves their yellow, orange and red colours.<br/><br/>Since the 1930s, scientists have identified about 800 carotenoids and about 40 are found in the human body, including the outermost layer of the epidermis, the dermis and subcutaneous fat. The most common carotenoids are beta-carotene, alpha-carotene, lutein, zeaxanthin, lycopene, and astaxanthin. You can read more about astaxanthin here.<br/><br/>The content of carotenoids in the skin is influenced by numerous factors, including the intake of fruits and vegetables, their bioavailability from various foods, supplementation, exposure to UV radiation, air pollution, alcohol consumption, smoking and stress.<br/><br/>How do Carotenoids Help My Skin?<br/><br/>Carotenoids are some of the best-known antioxidants for the skin and they also have important functions as anti-inflammatory agents.<br/><br/>Healthy Aging and Skin Repair<br/><br/>Antioxidants are essential for healthy skin because they help to prevent free radical damage to cells. Free radical damage causes premature aging and the onset of various types of skin cancers. Carotenoids, along with vitamin E, vitamin C, and Co enzyme Q10 are important dermal antioxidants.<br/><br/>Due to their antioxidant activity, carotenoids support and encourage collagen and elastin production in the skin. This helps to increase the skin's density, thickness, elasticity, and firmness. Collagen and elastin decrease as we age, so getting enough carotenoids in the diet and topically is critical for aging well.<br/><br/>Carotenoids can improve the signs of photoaging, skin discolouration, elasticity, hydration, texture, and can reduce transepidermal water loss.<br/><br/>Astaxanthin in particular stimulates fibroblasts to produce collagen and elastin, inhibits the activity of the enzymes that breakdown collagen and elastin, and shows anti-inflammatory and UV-filtering effects. It has been shown to reduce melanin in the skin, which results in the decrease in the appearance of freckles and melasma.<br/><br/>Anti-acne activity: the anti-inflammatory activity of carotenoids helps to dampen the inflammation and irritation associated with acne. Carotenoids also help to normalize and balance oil secretions from the sebaceous glands. They are valuable agents in skin repair and they stimulate epidermal regeneration, helping to smooth and soften skin.<br/><br/>Where Can I Find Carotenoids?<br/><br/>There are two ways to get your daily dose of carotenoids: through diet and through topical application. The combination of both is the ideal approach to well-aging skincare.<br/><br/>Carotenoids are fat-soluble, so your body needs fat to absorb them (think tomatoes and olive oil, broccoli and butter, or spinach and avocado). Common sources of carotenoids in food are avocado, egg yolks, kale, spinach, carrots, sweet potatoes, papaya, and tomatoes.<br/><br/>While we advocate getting as many of your nutrients and antioxidants as you can from food rather than supplementation; one study showed that astaxanthin combined with collagen hydrolysate significantly improved barrier integrity, reduced transepidermal water loss, and increased the expression of procollagen type I mRNA.<br/><br/>Topical application is key to healthy skin. Studies show that high concentrations of antioxidants in human skin offer the best protection for healthy skin at any age.<br/><br/>At Sarka Botanicals, we blend carotenoid-rich, whole plants such as calendula, dandelion, and extracts like astaxanthin with cold-pressed oils and functional ingredients. Calendula alone contains over 19 different types of carotenoids. This may explain why it has such a long history of use in skin care. Studies show that carotenoids blended with co-enzyme Q10 are especially effective at reducing inflammation and slowing premature skin aging due to sun exposure. | Beneficiile carotenoidelor pentru piele<br/><br/>Ați auzit de carotenoizi? Aceste fitochimice puternice sunt constituenții pigmentați găsiți în plante care dau flori, fructe și își lasă culorile galbene, portocalii și roșii.<br/><br/>Începând cu anii 1930, oamenii de știință au identificat aproximativ 800 de carotenoizi și aproximativ 40 se găsesc în corpul uman, inclusiv stratul exterior al epidermei, dermul și grăsimea subcutanată. Cele mai frecvente carotenoide sunt beta-carotenul, alfa-carotenul, luteina, zeaxantina, licopenul și astaxantina. Puteți citi mai multe despre astaxantina aici.<br/><br/>Conținutul de carotenoizi din piele este influențat de numeroși factori, inclusiv aportul de fructe și legume, biodisponibilitatea acestora din diferite alimente, suplimentarea, expunerea la radiațiile UV, poluarea aerului, consumul de alcool, fumatul și stresul.<br/><br/>Cum îmi ajută carotenoizii pielea?<br/><br/>Carotenoizii sunt unii dintre cei mai cunoscuți antioxidanți pentru piele și au, de asemenea, funcții importante ca agenți antiinflamatori.<br/><br/>Îmbătrânire sănătoasă și repararea pielii<br/><br/>Antioxidanții sunt esențiali pentru o piele sănătoasă, deoarece ajută la prevenirea daunelor cauzate de radicalii liberi celulelor. Daunele cauzate de radicalii liberi cauzează îmbătrânirea prematură și apariția diferitelor tipuri de cancer de piele. Carotenoizii, împreună cu vitamina E, vitamina C și enzima Co Q10 sunt antioxidanți dermici importanți.<br/><br/>Datorită activității lor antioxidante, carotenoizii susțin și încurajează producția de colagen și elastină în piele. Acest lucru ajută la creșterea densității, grosimii, elasticității și fermității pielii. Colagenul și elastina scad pe măsură ce îmbătrânim, astfel încât obținerea de suficiente carotenoizi în dietă și din punct de vedere local este critică pentru îmbătrânirea bine.<br/><br/>Carotenoizii pot îmbunătăți semnele de fotoîmbătrânire, decolorarea pielii, elasticitatea, hidratarea, textura și pot reduce pierderea de apă transepidermică.<br/><br/>Astaxantina, în special, stimulează fibroblastele pentru a produce colagen și elastină, inhibă activitatea enzimelor care descompun colagenul și elastina și prezintă efecte antiinflamatorii și de filtrare UV. S-a demonstrat că reduce melanina din piele, ceea ce duce la scăderea apariției pistruiilor și a melasmei.<br/><br/>Activitate anti-acnee: activitatea anti-inflamatorie a carotenoizilor ajută la amortizarea inflamației și iritației asociate cu acneea. Carotenoizii ajută, de asemenea, la normalizarea și echilibrarea secrețiilor de ulei din glandele sebacee. Ele sunt agenți valoroși în repararea pielii și stimulează regenerarea epidermică, ajutând la netezirea și înmuierea pielii.<br/><br/>Unde pot găsi carotenoizi?<br/><br/>Există două modalități de a obține doza zilnică de carotenoizi: prin dietă și prin aplicare topică. Combinația dintre cele două este abordarea ideală pentru îngrijirea pielii cu îmbătrânire bună.<br/><br/>Carotenoizii sunt solubili în grăsimi, astfel încât organismul are nevoie de grăsimi pentru a le absorbi (gândiți-vă la roșii și ulei de măsline, broccoli și unt sau spanac și avocado). Sursele comune de carotenoizi în alimente sunt avocado, gălbenușuri de ou, varză, spanac, morcovi, cartofi dulci, papaya și roșii.<br/><br/>În timp ce susținem obținerea cât mai multor nutrienți și antioxidanți din alimente, mai degrabă decât din suplimente; un studiu a arătat că astaxantina combinată cu hidrolizatul de colagen a îmbunătățit semnificativ integritatea barierei, a redus pierderea de apă transepidermică și a crescut expresia ARNm procolagen tip I.<br/><br/>Aplicarea topică este esențială pentru o piele sănătoasă. Studiile arată că concentrațiile ridicate de antioxidanți din pielea umană oferă cea mai bună protecție pentru o piele sănătoasă la orice vârstă.<br/><br/>La Sarka Botanicals, amestecăm plante întregi bogate în carotenoizi, cum ar fi calendula, păpădie și extracte precum astaxantina cu uleiuri presate la rece și ingrediente funcționale. Calendula singură conține peste 19 tipuri diferite de carotenoizi. Acest lucru poate explica de ce are o istorie atât de lungă de utilizare în îngrijirea pielii. Studiile arată că carotenoizii amestecați cu coenzima Q10 sunt deosebit de eficienți în reducerea inflamației și în încetinirea îmbătrânirii premature a pielii datorită expunerii la soare. |
