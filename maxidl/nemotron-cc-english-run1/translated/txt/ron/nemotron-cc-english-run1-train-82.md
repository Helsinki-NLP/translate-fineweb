In simple terms, the condition is characterized by: one develops a kidney disease and undergoes a kidney transplant and other diseases associated with acidic concentration in the blood and gout. In theory, the condition will occur even if the genetic change is inherited from one parent and sporadically occurs when there is no family history.<br/><br/>Common names of autosomal dominant interstitial kidney disease<br/><br/>The condition has other names as well namely: medullary cystic kidney disease, although this name is not used as much because most people suffering from this condition do not have medullary cysts. It is also referred to as juvenile hyperuricemic nephropathy. The disease tends to affect people of ages 20 to 50. The latter condition as aforementioned occurs in young children, something, which translate to get it from both parents.<br/>Cystic kidney disease is an inherited condition whereby the cysts in the centre of each kidney gradually lose their ability to function properly. Cysts refer to abnormal blisters of fluid in the kidney. The condition further scares the kidney making unable to concentrate the urine and as a result, producing too much urine. Its symptoms include excessive urination, salt cravings, weakness, confusion, bleeding, fatigue, frequent hiccups, low blood pressure, nausea and vomiting, headaches, pale skin, reduced sensation in the hands, weight loss among many others. Other complications include: anemia, ulcers, loss of bone density, infertility and other heart related problems.<br/>Its analysis incorporates blood tests to check for sodium levels and general kidney functions, urine tests to check the levels of concentration and other imbalances, x rays to check for the size of kidneys that may be altered owing to increased urine concentrations, renal biopsy and genetic testing to verify any genetic changes that might have taken place in due time.<br/>While the disease does not have a cut and dry treatment to it, one may focus on controlling measures, which include intake of fluids and salt to supplement the one lost as the disease progresses into latter stages. This also helps reduce dehydration. Other treatments include taking of prescribed medication and diet changes and minimal intakes of foods containing phosphorous and potassium. Further complications may also require one to have a kidney transplant. Basically, this is not a curable disease but rather a manageable once detected in the early stages.<br/><br/>The common yet different factor of Autosomal dominant interstitial kidney disease<br/><br/>Nephronophthisis and medullary cystic kidney disease are mainly grouped together because, in essence, they share the same features but with a slight difference in regards inheritance patterns to the former affecting children and the latter affecting young adults and older age groups. Similar features for both are ADH resistant urine concentration that leads to polyuria and polydipsia, anemia and renal diseases.<br/>The former aforementioned condition is Autosomal recessive accounting to 15% of chronic diseases and causes ESRD during early childhood while the latter is Autosomal dominant with a few sporadic new mutations and causes ESRD for people between the ages of 30 and 50. | Blog de certificare CPR online<br/><br/>Data: 23 iulie 2014<br/><br/>Boala renală interstițială autozomal dominantă este o colecție rară de boli care afectează funcțiile cunoscute ale rinichilor. În termeni simpli, condiția se caracterizează prin: se dezvoltă o boală de rinichi și se efectuează un transplant de rinichi și alte boli asociate cu concentrația acidă în sânge și gută. În teorie, condiția va apărea chiar dacă schimbarea genetică este moștenită de la un părinte și apare sporadic atunci când nu există istoric familial.<br/><br/>Denumirile comune ale bolii renale interstiţiale autozomale dominante<br/><br/>Condiția are și alte denumiri, și anume: boală renală chistică medulară, deși acest nume nu este folosit la fel de mult, deoarece majoritatea persoanelor care suferă de această afecțiune nu au chisturi medulare. Este, de asemenea, menționată ca nefropatie hiperuricemică juvenilă. Boala tinde să afecteze persoanele cu vârste cuprinse între 20 și 50 de ani. Această din urmă condiție, așa cum sa menționat mai sus, apare la copiii mici, ceea ce se traduce prin obținerea acesteia de la ambii părinți.<br/>Boala renală chistică este o afecțiune moștenită prin care chisturile din centrul fiecărui rinichi își pierd treptat capacitatea de a funcționa corect. Chisturile se referă la vezicule anormale de lichid în rinichi. Această afecțiune sperie și mai mult rinichiul făcându-l incapabil să concentreze urina și, ca urmare, producând prea multă urină. Simptomele sale includ urinarea excesivă, pofta de sare, slăbiciune, confuzie, sângerare, oboseală, sughiț frecvent, tensiune arterială scăzută, greață și vărsături, dureri de cap, piele palidă, senzație redusă în mâini, pierdere în greutate, printre multe altele. Alte complicații includ: anemie, ulcere, pierderea densității osoase, infertilitate și alte probleme legate de inimă.<br/>Analiza sa include teste de sânge pentru a verifica nivelurile de sodiu și funcțiile generale ale rinichilor, teste de urină pentru a verifica nivelurile de concentrație și alte dezechilibre, raze X pentru a verifica dimensiunea rinichilor care pot fi modificate din cauza concentrațiilor crescute de urină, biopsie renală și teste genetice pentru a verifica orice modificări genetice care ar fi putut avea loc în timp util.<br/>În timp ce boala nu are un tratament tăiat și uscat, se poate concentra asupra măsurilor de control, care includ aportul de lichide și sare pentru a suplimenta pe cea pierdută pe măsură ce boala progresează în ultimele etape. Acest lucru ajută, de asemenea, la reducerea deshidratării. Alte tratamente includ administrarea de medicamente prescrise și modificări ale dietei și aporturi minime de alimente care conțin fosfor și potasiu. Alte complicații pot necesita, de asemenea, un transplant de rinichi. Practic, aceasta nu este o boală vindecabilă, ci mai degrabă o boală gestionabilă odată detectată în stadiile incipiente.<br/><br/>Factorul comun, dar diferit, al bolii renale interstițiale autozomale dominante<br/><br/>Nefronoftiza și boala renală chistică medulară sunt grupate în principal deoarece, în esență, au aceleași caracteristici, dar cu o ușoară diferență în ceea ce privește modelele de moștenire față de primele care afectează copiii și cele din urmă care afectează adulții tineri și grupurile de vârstă mai în vârstă. Caracteristici similare pentru ambele sunt concentrația de urină rezistentă la ADH care duce la poliurie și polidipsie, anemie și boli renale.<br/>Prima condiție menționată mai sus este autozomal recesivă care reprezintă 15% din bolile cronice și cauzează ESRD în timpul copilăriei timpurii, în timp ce cea din urmă este autozomal dominantă cu câteva mutații noi sporadice și cauzează ESRD pentru persoanele cu vârste cuprinse între 30 și 50 de ani. |
| Hobbes' vs. Locke's Account on the State of Nature<br/><br/>Topic: PhilosophyWords: 2539Pages: 9Aug 3rd, 2021<br/><br/>Hobbes and Locke are among the most influential political philosophers to ever write in English. The state of nature, which precedes the organization of the complex societies, is the common premise that both Hobbes and Locke share but interpret in different ways. The former views humans in their natural state as equally dangerous and free to pursue their egoistic goals unrestricted by the nonexistent notions of justice, which is why his natural state amounts to the "war of every man against every man" (Hobbes76). The latter, on the other hand, views humans in their original condition as equally valuable and restricts natural freedom by the idea of justice that requires not to harm others, which allows defining the state of nature as "mutual assistance and preservation" rather than war (Locke 15). The key difference between the two philosophers' accounts of natural state is that Locke uses ethical considerations while Hobbes does not, and it ultimately leads Hobbes to envisage a state exercising unlimited power over human beings, while Locke limits the government by the moral principles, which he considers a natural law.<br/><br/>Hobbes bases his assumptions regarding the state of nature on the fact that all people are roughly equal in their physical and mental capabilities. He admits that some individuals may demonstrate greater physical strength or superior intellect but insists that "when all is reckoned together, the difference between man and man is not so considerable" (Hobbes 74). Since humans are roughly equal in their capabilities, they also have similar hopes to attain their ends and satisfy their needs (Hobbes 75). As a logical outcome of this equality, when the people begin competing for scarce resources, no one may feel entirely secure in his or her possessions. Even if a mighty, cunning, and capable person succeeds in subjugating "the persons of all men he can," it still does not guarantee the ultimate security (Hobbes 75). As no human can obtain such superiority over the others that renders him or her utterly immune to their strength of intellect, no human can feel completely safe when surrounded by his or her equals. Hobbes' equality in the natural state is equality of fear, where all humans view each other as dangerous competitors.<br/><br/>Just as Hobbes, Locke considers all human beings to be fundamentally equal, but assigns a very different meaning to the term. From his perspective, it is not the equality of capabilities, but, rather, the equality of value. He opines that the people "promiscuously born to all the same advantages of nature" should logically enjoy the perfect equality among them, as there is no reason to consider anyone inherently more valuable (Locke 8). The only possible foundation for designating some people as superior to others would be if God "by any manifest declaration of his will, set one above another" (Locke 8). Since such divine sanction of superiority is absent, Locke concludes that the natural equality of all representatives of humankind is not to be called into question. Hobbes approaches equality pragmatically and stresses that people in their natural state are equally dangerous, but Locke employs an ethical approach and emphasizes that humans are equally valuable in God's eyes. This disagreement is but the first difference between the two authors based on the fact that Locke includes God as a premise into his political philosophy, while Hobbes does not.<br/><br/>Another characteristic feature of Hobbes' account of the natural state is his interpretation of liberty. According to Hobbes, the state of nature implies unlimited freedom to do whatever is necessary for one's continued existence. The philosopher defines liberty as "the absence of external impediments" in using one's abilities to attain one's goals (Hobbes 79). The primary purpose of every sentient being is to maintain its continued existence. As a consequence, Hobbesian freedom amounts to the unhindered opportunity to do anything that, in one's judgment, would be best suited to preserve one's life and possessions (Hobbes 79). The only limitation to liberty is that a person cannot do anything contradictory to sustaining his or her life or destroying "the means of preserving the same" (Hobbes 79). Apart from that, there are no boundaries, and everyone has "a right to everything, even to one another's body" if that furthers one's survival (Hobbes 80). Thus, natural liberty, as viewed by Hobbes, is the absence of externally enforced obstacles in pursuing one's right to everything to sustain and secure one's continued existence.<br/><br/>Locke also upholds the idea of natural liberty but, unsurprisingly, approaches it in a manner that is significantly different from that of Hobbes. As soon as he begins discussing liberty in the state of nature, he immediately notes that a state of freedom does not equate "a state of license" (Locke 9). The philosopher identifies two specific limitations to human freedom in the state of nature. The first one is identical to that introduce by Hobbes: however free and independent, a person nevertheless "has not liberty to destroy himself" (Locke 9). Yet the second limitation contradicts Hobbes' prepositions directly. According to Locke, every human being has a natural obligation not to "harm another in his life, health, liberty, or possessions" (9). Just as with his interpretation of equality, the author bases this assertion on ethical and religious grounds: people should preserve each other's existence since they are all creations of the same "omnipotent, and infinitely wise maker" (Locke 9). Thus, Locke's limits liberty in the natural state far more stringently than Hobbes by introducing the obligation to refrain from harming both oneself and the others.<br/><br/>The differences between the two authors also manifest in their accounts of justice in the natural state of humanity. As far as Hobbes is concerned, delineating just and unjust practices is merely the matter of the law. There is no jurisprudence in the state of nature, and the only law governing human beings in their original condition is a natural law that only obliges them to seek personal security. As a result, nothing can be unjust in the original state of the humankind: "notions of right and wrong justice and injustice" have no place and no meaning in the absence of the stringently enforced law (Hobbes 78). As long as the people use their virtually unlimited freedom to ruthlessly compete with each other for resources, to which they are equally entitled, they have no criteria to differentiate between just and unjust actions. Therefore, the Hobbesian state of nature defies the very idea of justice since the author interprets it as a mere function of the formalized and established law.<br/><br/>Locke assigns different meaning to justice and views it not so much in legislative as in the ethical terms. This paper already mentioned that, unlike Hobbes, Locke employs ethical notions and generally bases his political philosophy on moral rather than purely practical presumptions. Locke's natural law, unlike that of Hobbes, obliges human beings to take care of each other rather than simply leaving everyone to fend for themselves. As a result, there is a place for justice and injustice in his state of nature. The author points to this fact himself when noting that no one should deprive another of his or her life of the means of preserving it "unless it be to do justice on an offender" (Locke 9). This statement reveals with the utmost clarity that, according to Locke, there is justice in the state of nature, and, moreover, humans have to preserve it actively. The criterion of justice, which Hobbes' natural state lacks, is the second limitation on natural liberty imposed by Locke: an action is unjust if it constitutes an unwarranted threat to another person's life and possessions.<br/><br/>These differences in the two authors' treatment of equality, liberty, and justice or injustice culminate in their interpretation of the relationship between the state of nature and the state of war. From Hobbes's perspective, the two are synonymous, because the ruthless competition is the only logical outcome of putting people with equivalent capabilities and similar needs in an environment with limited resources. He states this connection outright: "if any two men desire the same thing, which nevertheless they cannot both enjoy, they become enemies" and are, therefore, in the state of war with each other (Hobbes 75). Yet since humans are numerous and all possess similar capabilities and needs, this competition manifests not only in the individual interactions but also on the level of humanity as a whole. As long as all humans have equal and unlimited rights to all resources and even to each other's bodies and lives, the state of nature is a war of "every man against every man" (Hobbes 76). This grim interpretation stems directly from Hobbes' portrayal of the state of nature as governed solely by the individuals' egoistic urges.<br/><br/>Locke, on the other hand, differentiates between the state of nature and the state of war and points out that, while they may occur simultaneously, it is no reason to identify one with the other. Locke's definition of the state of war is virtually identical to that offered by Hobbes. According to Locke, "he who attempts to get another man into his absolute power does thereby put himself into a state of war with him" (14). This explanation lines up perfectly with the Hobbesian notion that everyone's universal right to everything, including the other people's bodies and lives, leads to the state of war. Yet Locke refuses to equate the state of war and the state of nature precisely because he denies Hobbes' interpretation of natural freedom. Since Locke's natural state restrains people from harming each other through the second limitation of liberty, an attempt on another person's freedom is a transgression against the natural law. While for Hobbes, war is the humankind's condition by default, Locke portrays it as a perversion of the state of nature rather than its rule.<br/><br/>These differences in delineating the state on nature and its constituents, such as liberty, equality, justice, and war, pave the way to the authors contrasting portrayals of government. Based on his pessimistic assessment of the state of nature, the author of Leviathan concludes that, under conditions of war, there can be no definite hope for "living out the time which nature ordinarily alloweth men to live" (Hobbes 80). The solution is laying down the universal right to everything and leaving everyone "so much liberty against other men, as he would allow other men against himself" (Hobbes 80). The participants of the resulting social contract invest the unlimited liberties they have surrendered into a sovereign – the bearer of the supreme power whose purpose is to preserve the achieved status quo by punishing all transgressions against it. Sovereign's power is absolute: the ruler has the authority "to do whatsoever he shall think necessary" to promote peace between his subjects so that no one would assail another's life or property (113). Hobbes concludes that without such an unassailable figure entitled with the right to do anything to the subjects, there can be no peace and no guarantee of security.<br/><br/>While Locke agrees with the necessity of creating politically organized societies, he nevertheless opposes Hobbes' idea of the sovereign power as unlimited and unassailable. As mentioned above, Locke's state of nature is not nearly as dreadful as that painted by Hobbes because of the people's obligation to preserve not only themselves but each other as well. Therefore, the need for social contract arises not from the fear of the others, but from the sheer convenience. Small communities may not need numerous laws to solve conflicts and "officers to superintend the process," but larger associations find it advisable to institute governments for that purpose (Locke 57). Yet the power of the government cannot be unlimited because it would result in subduing the subjects to an "inconstant, uncertain, unknown, arbitrary will of another man" (Locke 17). Such a government would constitute a twofold violation of the natural law. By agreeing to another person's absolute power over his life, a subject would violate its first limitation prohibiting to harm oneself. As for the ruler, destroying another person's liberty would constitute direct harm and, as such, be contradictory to the second limitation.<br/><br/>As a direct continuation of his case for unlimited governmental authority, Hobbes denies the separation of powers as a principle. From his perspective, the sovereign, once instituted, possesses "the whole power of prescribing the rules" governing the lives of the subjects or, in shorter terms, the legislative power (Hobbes 114). The sovereign also reserves the right of "hearing and deciding all controversies" – that is, the judicial power (Hobbes 114). Finally, since the entire purpose of the sovereign is to force the subjects to refrain from harming each other, there can be no doubt that executive power is also his or her exclusive prerogative. The separation of powers as a concept is alien to Hobbes because of his views on the state of nature. Creating a political entity where the executive, legislative, and judicial branches would check each other – that is, compete – would mean recreating the Hobbesian state of nature-as-war on a higher level. Since the people enter a social contract and institute a government to put the state of nature behind them, not reinstate it in a different form, the separation of powers contradictory Hobbes' views directly.<br/><br/>Locke, on the other hand, embraces separation of power as a foundational principle of his political theory. His case for the separation is evident in the discussion of the limits of the legislative power. As Locke puts it, it would be hardly advisable "for the same persons, who have the power of making laws, to have also in their hands the power to execute them" (76). The philosopher points to the imperfections of human nature and the inherent desire to "grasp at power" as a rationale for this precautionary measure (Locke 76). Just as in Hobbes' case, Locke's account of the separation of powers stems directly from his interpretation of the state of nature. If there is already justice in the state of nature and the people can understand it, any government is inevitably subject to the same natural law. Since absolute power over people violates both limitations of this law, separating and distributing it is advisable so that the government would function appropriately.<br/><br/>This paper has demonstrated that, while the differences between Hobbes' and Locke's accounts of the natural state of humanity are numerous, they ultimately amount to the presence of absence of moral premises. Hobbes views the natural state as that of unlimited liberty, where people endowed with equal capabilities and not bound by any moral notions, such as justice, compete for the resources unceasingly. Locke, however, interprets equality and liberty ethically rather than practically and opines that war is a perversion of the natural state, as the natural law obliges humans not to harm each other. This disagreement influences the philosophers' approaches to government. Hobbes insists on an all-powerful ruler, as, in the absence of ethical restraints, no other authority could force the humans to refrain from harming each other. Yet, in Locke's view, granting the government unlimited powers would be contradictory to the ethical limitations embedded in the law of nature, which is why he, unlike Hobbes, advocates separation of powers. | Relatarea lui Hobbes vs. Locke despre starea naturii<br/><br/>Subiect: FilozofieCuvinte: 2539Pagini: 9Aug 3rd, 2021<br/><br/>Hobbes și Locke sunt printre cei mai influenți filosofi politici care au scris vreodată în limba engleză. Starea naturii, care precede organizarea societăților complexe, este premisa comună pe care atât Hobbes cât și Locke o împărtășesc, dar o interpretează în moduri diferite. Cei dintâi îi consideră pe oameni în starea lor naturală la fel de periculoși și liberi să-și urmărească scopurile egoiste fără a fi restricționați de noțiunile inexistente de justiție, motiv pentru care starea sa naturală echivalează cu „războiul fiecărui om împotriva fiecărui om” (Hobbes 76). Aceasta din urmă, pe de altă parte, consideră că oamenii în starea lor inițială sunt la fel de valoroși și restricționează libertatea naturală prin ideea de justiție care cere să nu-i rănească pe alții, ceea ce permite definirea stării naturii ca „asistență și conservare reciprocă” mai degrabă decât război (Locke 15). Diferența cheie dintre relatările celor doi filozofi despre starea naturală este că Locke folosește considerente etice în timp ce Hobbes nu o face, și în cele din urmă îl determină pe Hobbes să prevadă un stat care exercită o putere nelimitată asupra ființelor umane, în timp ce Locke limitează guvernul prin principiile morale, pe care le consideră o lege naturală.<br/><br/>Hobbes își bazează ipotezele cu privire la starea naturii pe faptul că toți oamenii sunt aproximativ egali în capacitățile lor fizice și mentale. El admite că unii indivizi pot demonstra o mai mare putere fizică sau intelectul superior, dar insistă că „atunci când totul este socotit împreună, diferența dintre om și om nu este atât de considerabilă” (Hobbes 74). Deoarece oamenii sunt aproximativ egali în capacitățile lor, ei au, de asemenea, speranțe similare de a-și atinge scopurile și de a-și satisface nevoile (Hobbes 75). Ca rezultat logic al acestei egalități, atunci când oamenii încep să concureze pentru resursele limitate, nimeni nu se poate simți în întregime în siguranță în posesiunile sale. Chiar dacă o persoană puternică, vicleană și capabilă reușește să subjuge „persoanele tuturor oamenilor pe care le poate”, aceasta nu garantează totuși securitatea supremă (Hobbes 75). Deoarece nici un om nu poate obține o astfel de superioritate asupra celorlalți, care îl face complet imun la puterea intelectului lor, nici un om nu se poate simți complet în siguranță atunci când este înconjurat de egalii săi. Egalitatea lui Hobbes în starea naturală este egalitatea fricii, în care toți oamenii se văd unii pe alții ca concurenți periculoși.<br/><br/>La fel ca Hobbes, Locke consideră că toate ființele umane sunt fundamental egale, dar atribuie un sens foarte diferit termenului. Din perspectiva sa, nu este egalitatea capacităților, ci, mai degrabă, egalitatea valorii. El este de părere că oamenii „născuți în mod promiscuu cu toate aceleași avantaje ale naturii” ar trebui să se bucure în mod logic de egalitatea perfectă între ei, deoarece nu există niciun motiv pentru a considera pe cineva în mod inerent mai valoros (Locke 8). Singurul temei posibil pentru a numi unii oameni superiori altora ar fi dacă Dumnezeu „prin orice declarație vădită a voii Sale, ar pune unul deasupra celuilalt” (Locke 8). Întrucât o astfel de sancţionare divină a superiorităţii este absentă, Locke concluzionează că egalitatea naturală a tuturor reprezentanţilor omenirii nu trebuie pusă în discuţie. Hobbes abordează pragmatic egalitatea și subliniază că oamenii în starea lor naturală sunt la fel de periculoși, dar Locke folosește o abordare etică și subliniază că oamenii sunt la fel de valoroși în ochii lui Dumnezeu. Acest dezacord nu este decât prima diferență dintre cei doi autori bazată pe faptul că Locke îl include pe Dumnezeu ca premisă în filosofia sa politică, în timp ce Hobbes nu o face.<br/><br/>O altă caracteristică caracteristică a lui Hobbes a stării naturale este interpretarea sa a libertății. Potrivit lui Hobbes, starea naturii implică libertatea nelimitată de a face tot ceea ce este necesar pentru existența continuă. Filosoful definește libertatea ca fiind „absența obstacolelor externe” în folosirea abilităților pentru a-și atinge obiectivele (Hobbes 79). Scopul principal al fiecărei ființe simțitoare este de a-și menține existența continuă. În consecință, libertatea Hobbesiana este oportunitatea neîmpiedicată de a face orice, în opinia cuiva, ar fi cel mai potrivit pentru a-și păstra viața și posesiunile (Hobbes 79). Singura limită a libertăţii este că o persoană nu poate face nimic contradictoriu cu menţinerea vieţii sale sau cu distrugerea „mijloacelor de păstrare a acesteia” (Hobbes 79). În afară de aceasta, nu există limite și fiecare are „dreptul la tot, chiar și la corpul celuilalt” dacă acest lucru promovează supraviețuirea (Hobbes 80). Astfel, libertatea naturală, așa cum a fost văzută de Hobbes, este absența obstacolelor impuse din exterior în urmărirea dreptului la tot pentru a-și susține și asigura existența continuă.<br/><br/>Locke susține, de asemenea, ideea de libertate naturală, dar, fără surprindere, o abordează într-un mod semnificativ diferit de cel al lui Hobbes. De îndată ce începe să discute despre libertate în starea de natură, el observă imediat că o stare de libertate nu echivalează cu "o stare de licență" (Locke 9). Filosoful identifică două limitări specifice libertății umane în starea de natură. Prima este identică cu cea introdusă de Hobbes: oricât de liberă și independentă ar fi o persoană, totuși „nu are libertatea de a se distruge pe sine” (Locke 9). Cu toate acestea, a doua limitare contrazice în mod direct prepozițiile lui Hobbes. Potrivit lui Locke, fiecare ființă umană are o obligație naturală de a nu „răni pe altul în viața, sănătatea, libertatea sau posesiunile sale”. La fel ca în interpretarea sa a egalității, autorul întemeiază această afirmație pe motive etice și religioase: oamenii ar trebui să păstreze existența celuilalt, deoarece sunt toate creații ale aceluiași „atotputernic și infinit înțelept” (Locke 9). Astfel, Locke limitează libertatea în starea naturală mult mai strict decât Hobbes prin introducerea obligației de a se abține de la a vă răni atât pe voi înșivă, cât și pe ceilalți.<br/><br/>Diferențele dintre cei doi autori se manifestă și în relatările lor despre justiție în starea naturală a umanității. În ceea ce privește Hobbes, delimitarea practicilor drepte și nedrepte este doar o chestiune de drept. Nu există jurisprudență în starea de natură, iar singura lege care guvernează ființele umane în starea lor inițială este o lege naturală care le obligă doar să caute securitatea personală. În consecință, nimic nu poate fi nedrept în starea inițială a omenirii: „noțiunile de dreptate și nedreptate corectă și greșită” nu au loc și nu au sens în absența legii strict aplicate (Hobbes 78). Atâta timp cât oamenii își folosesc libertatea lor practic nelimitată pentru a concura fără milă unii cu alții pentru resurse, la care au dreptul în mod egal, ei nu au criterii pentru a distinge între acțiunile drepte și cele nedrepte. Prin urmare, starea de natură hobbesiană sfidează însăși ideea de justiție, deoarece autorul o interpretează ca o simplă funcție a legii formalizate și stabilite.<br/><br/>Locke atribuie o semnificație diferită justiției și o vede nu atât în termeni legislativi, cât în termeni etici. Acest articol a menționat deja că, spre deosebire de Hobbes, Locke folosește noțiuni etice și, în general, își bazează filosofia politică pe prezumții morale, mai degrabă decât pur practice. Legea naturală a lui Locke, spre deosebire de cea a lui Hobbes, obligă ființele umane să aibă grijă unii de alții, mai degrabă decât pur și simplu să-i lase pe toți să se descurce singuri. Ca rezultat, există un loc pentru dreptate și nedreptate în starea sa de natură. Autorul subliniază el însuşi acest fapt, remarcând că nimeni nu trebuie să priveze pe altul de viaţa sa de mijloacele de a o păstra „dacă nu este vorba de a face dreptate unui infractor” (Locke 9). Această afirmație dezvăluie cu cea mai mare claritate că, potrivit lui Locke, există dreptate în starea naturii și, în plus, oamenii trebuie să o păstreze în mod activ. Criteriul justiţiei, de care Hobbes nu dispune în starea sa naturală, este a doua limită a libertăţii naturale impusă de Locke: o acţiune este nedreaptă dacă constituie o ameninţare nejustificată la adresa vieţii şi posesiunilor altei persoane.<br/><br/>Aceste diferențe în tratarea egalității, libertății și justiției sau nedreptății de către cei doi autori culminează în interpretarea lor a relației dintre starea de natură și starea de război. Din perspectiva lui Hobbes, cele două sunt sinonime, deoarece concurența nemilos este singurul rezultat logic al punerii oamenilor cu capacități echivalente și nevoi similare într-un mediu cu resurse limitate. El afirmă această conexiune direct: „dacă doi oameni doresc același lucru, de care totuși nu se pot bucura amândoi, devin dușmani” și, prin urmare, sunt în stare de război unul cu celălalt (Hobbes 75). Cu toate acestea, deoarece oamenii sunt numeroși și toți posedă capacități și nevoi similare, această competiție se manifestă nu numai în interacțiunile individuale, ci și la nivelul omenirii în ansamblu. Atâta timp cât toți oamenii au drepturi egale și nelimitate asupra tuturor resurselor și chiar asupra corpurilor și vieții celuilalt, starea naturii este un război al „fiecărui om împotriva fiecărui om” (Hobbes 76). Această interpretare sumbră provine direct din portretizarea lui Hobbes a stării naturii, guvernată exclusiv de impulsurile egoiste ale indivizilor.<br/><br/>Locke, pe de altă parte, face diferența între starea de natură și starea de război și subliniază că, deși acestea pot apărea simultan, nu este un motiv să ne identificăm unul cu celălalt. Definiția lui Locke a stării de război este practic identică cu cea oferită de Hobbes. Potrivit lui Locke, "cel care încearcă să aducă un alt om în puterea sa absolută se pune astfel într-o stare de război cu el" (14). Această explicație se potrivește perfect cu noțiunea hobbesiană că dreptul universal al tuturor la tot, inclusiv la corpurile și viețile celorlalți oameni, duce la starea de război. Cu toate acestea, Locke refuză să egaleze starea de război cu starea naturii tocmai pentru că el neagă interpretarea lui Hobbes a libertății naturale. Deoarece starea naturală a lui Locke îi împiedică pe oameni să se rănească reciproc prin a doua limitare a libertății, o încercare de libertate a unei alte persoane este o încălcare a legii naturale. În timp ce pentru Hobbes, războiul este condiția implicită a omenirii, Locke îl descrie ca o perversiune a stării naturii, mai degrabă decât a guvernării sale.<br/><br/>Aceste diferențe în delimitarea statului asupra naturii și a constituenților săi, cum ar fi libertatea, egalitatea, justiția și războiul, deschid calea pentru autorii portrete contrastante ale guvernării. Bazându-se pe evaluarea sa pesimistă a stării naturii, autorul Leviatanului concluzionează că, în condiții de război, nu poate exista o speranță clară de „a trăi timpul pe care natura îi permite de obicei oamenilor să trăiască” (Hobbes 80). Soluția este de a stabili dreptul universal la tot și de a lăsa tuturor „atât de multă libertate împotriva altor oameni, cât ar permite altor oameni împotriva lui însuși” (Hobbes 80). Participanții la contractul social rezultat investesc libertățile nelimitate pe care le-au predat într-un suveran – purtătorul puterii supreme al cărui scop este să păstreze status quo-ul obținut prin pedepsirea tuturor încălcărilor împotriva lui. Puterea suveranului este absolută: conducătorul are autoritatea „să facă tot ce consideră necesar” pentru a promova pacea între supuşii săi, astfel încât nimeni să nu atace viaţa sau proprietatea altuia. Hobbes concluzionează că fără o astfel de figură inatacabilă care are dreptul de a face ceva subiecților, nu poate exista pace și nici garanție de securitate.<br/><br/>În timp ce Locke este de acord cu necesitatea de a crea societăți organizate politic, el se opune totuși ideii lui Hobbes despre puterea suverană ca nelimitată și inatacabilă. După cum am menționat mai sus, starea de natură a lui Locke nu este aproape la fel de înfricoșătoare ca cea pictată de Hobbes din cauza obligației oamenilor de a se păstra nu numai pe ei înșiși, ci și pe alții. Prin urmare, nevoia de contract social nu apare din frica de ceilalți, ci din simpla comoditate. Comunitățile mici pot să nu aibă nevoie de numeroase legi pentru a rezolva conflictele și „ofițerii să supravegheze procesul”, dar asociațiile mai mari consideră că este recomandabil să se instituie guverne în acest scop (Locke 57). Cu toate acestea, puterea guvernului nu poate fi nelimitată, deoarece ar duce la supunerea subiecților la o "voință inconstantă, incertă, necunoscută, arbitrară a altui om" (Locke 17). Un astfel de guvern ar constitui o dublă încălcare a legii naturale. Prin acceptarea puterii absolute a unei alte persoane asupra vieții sale, un subiect ar încălca prima sa limită interzicându-și să se rănească. În ceea ce privește conducătorul, distrugerea libertății altei persoane ar constitui un prejudiciu direct și, ca atare, ar fi contrar celei de-a doua limitări.<br/><br/>Ca o continuare directă a argumentului său pentru o autoritate guvernamentală nelimitată, Hobbes neagă separarea puterilor ca principiu. Din perspectiva sa, suveranul, odată instituit, posedă „toată puterea de a prescrie regulile” care guvernează viața subiecților sau, pe scurt, puterea legislativă (Hobbes 114). Suveranul îşi rezervă, de asemenea, dreptul de a „auzi şi de a hotărî toate controversele” – adică puterea judiciară (Hobbes 114). În cele din urmă, din moment ce întregul scop al suveranului este de a forța subiecții să se abțină de la a se răni reciproc, nu poate fi nici o îndoială că puterea executivă este, de asemenea, prerogativă exclusivă a acestuia. Separarea puterilor ca concept este străină lui Hobbes din cauza viziunii sale asupra stării naturii. Crearea unei entități politice în care ramurile executivă, legislativă și judiciară să se verifice reciproc – adică să concureze – ar însemna recrearea stării Hobbesiene a naturii-ca-război la un nivel mai înalt. Din moment ce oamenii intră într-un contract social și instituie un guvern pentru a pune starea de natură în spatele lor, nu pentru a o reinstaura într-o formă diferită, separarea puterilor contradictorii punctele de vedere ale lui Hobbes în mod direct.<br/><br/>Locke, pe de altă parte, îmbrățișează separarea puterii ca un principiu fundamental al teoriei sale politice. argumentul său pentru separare este evident în discutarea limitelor puterii legislative. După cum spune Locke, ar fi cu greu recomandabil „că aceleași persoane, care au puterea de a face legi, să aibă și în mâinile lor puterea de a le executa” (76). Filozoful indică imperfecțiunile naturii umane și dorința inerentă de a „înțelege puterea” ca o rațiune pentru această măsură de precauție (Locke 76). La fel ca în cazul lui Hobbes, relatarea lui Locke despre separarea puterilor decurge direct din interpretarea sa a stării naturii. Dacă există deja dreptate în starea de natură și oamenii o pot înțelege, orice guvern este în mod inevitabil supus aceleiași legi naturale. Deoarece puterea absolută asupra oamenilor încalcă ambele limitări ale acestei legi, este recomandabil să o separe și să o distribuie astfel încât guvernul să funcționeze în mod corespunzător.<br/><br/>Această lucrare a demonstrat că, în timp ce diferențele dintre relatările lui Hobbes și Locke despre starea naturală a umanității sunt numeroase, ele se ridică în cele din urmă la prezența absenței premiselor morale. Hobbes consideră starea naturală ca fiind cea a libertății nelimitate, în care oamenii înzestrați cu capacități egale și necondiționați de orice noțiune morală, cum ar fi dreptatea, concurează neîncetat pentru resurse. Locke, cu toate acestea, interpretează egalitatea și libertatea din punct de vedere etic mai degrabă decât practic și consideră că războiul este o perversiune a stării naturale, deoarece legea naturală obligă oamenii să nu se rănească reciproc. Hobbes insistă asupra unui conducător atotputernic, deoarece, în absența constrângerilor etice, nicio altă autoritate nu ar putea forța oamenii să se abțină de la a se răni reciproc. Cu toate acestea, în opinia lui Locke, acordarea de puteri nelimitate guvernului ar fi în contradicție cu limitările etice încorporate în legea naturii, motiv pentru care el, spre deosebire de Hobbes, pledează pentru separarea puterilor. |
| Fashion Police: What Game of Thrones threw up<br/><br/>Canadian-French singer Abbas Hasan put blinding effort to outshine all of humanity at Fashion Parade 2014. Nothing wrong with that, except safety is priority and the musician is a health hazard here.<br/><br/>We get he wants to be a star. Sadly, he didn't get the memo where they tell the desperate and the infamous that stardom is a metaphor. You don't have to look like one and literally set our sight ablaze. Also, the All Pakistan Aunty Association has officially lodged a complaint against him. The local market has run dry of fake crystals and sequined monstrosities. They have nothing to wear to their biweekly high teas and they claim he is to blame. Apparently, the outfit is inspired by Game of Thrones. Can he please stick to composing sad songs about his neighbour's dead dog instead of conceptualising outfits? Or maybe it's the trauma of losing the dog, whose death he is clearly not over as he is still wearing its carcass.<br/><br/>The charge sheet Outfit<br/><br/>No one can decide where the outfit begins and where Abbas ends. You stare in fascination, sinking into a deep abyss and wonder why he is wearing leather pants. Whose horse did he kill to steal the saddle draped across his shoulders? Was he in prison right before his red carpet appearance and forgot to take off the chains? How will he survive the synthetic leather and post-sequin rash that is bound to be lethal in such high dosage? Why am I still alive?<br/><br/>Idea<br/><br/>His inspiration was seemingly Game of Thrones, but he eventually ended up looking like he was thrown out of a Viking restaurant. Had he come across any of the characters from the show, he would've been slain in the first five seconds of the first episode.<br/><br/>The mental health or lack thereof: Someone get him to a counsellor ASAP! He seems to be under the assumption that wearing a dead dog means that the only friend he had in his life is still alive. Dear Abbas:<br/><br/>1. Denial is not a river in Egypt<br/><br/>2. Your tortured psyche is not helping your music, so get help<br/><br/>3. Try imaginary friends<br/><br/>Bail out!<br/><br/>All of us at the Fashion Police headquarters are severely traumatised. Abbas is someone we did not enjoy arresting. He is currently in custody and attempting revenge by putting on attires from other fantasy shows. He just glitter glued himself in order to look like Edward Cullen from Twilight. As a public service message and to prevent further nervous breakdowns, we gave him the following examples of men from the red carpet of the same event.<br/><br/>Zohaib Hassan<br/><br/>When in doubt, play it safe. The singer looks like your average uncle at a shaadi. A plain black suit with no accessories, even if it's a tad disproportionate, is workable. Zohaib's look is blended into everything and nothing, and when you don't have a fashion sense or the money to hire a stylist, this is okay. It does not carry the risk of cardiac arrest for fellow attendees at an event. Given Abbas' delicate mental condition, this look is what he should aim for. Always and forever.<br/><br/>Ali Zafar<br/><br/>One day, after decades of therapy, Abbas could aspire to wear attire like Ali Zafar's. The dapper summer look is done to near perfection. Ali came really close to looking like a maître d at a French restaurant with his white summer jacket with black lapels, but the shirt saves it, never mind the satin. His pants would have been ridiculous had they not been folded at the ankles. The shoes are what hipster chic happy endings are made of. | Fashion Police: Ce a aruncat Game of Thrones<br/><br/>Cântărețul canado-francez Abbas Hasan a depus un efort orbitor pentru a depăși întreaga umanitate la Fashion Parade 2014. Nu este nimic în neregulă cu asta, cu excepția faptului că siguranța este o prioritate și muzicianul este un pericol pentru sănătate aici.<br/><br/>Ne dăm seama că vrea să fie o vedetă. Din păcate, el nu a primit memo-ul în cazul în care se spune disperat și infam că stardomul este o metaforă. Nu trebuie să arate ca unul și literalmente aprins vederea noastră. De asemenea, Asociația Mătușii All Pakistan a depus oficial o plângere împotriva lui. Piața locală a secat de cristale false și monstruozități cu paiete. Ei nu au nimic de purtat la ceaiurile lor înalte de două săptămâni și pretind că este de vină. Aparent, tinuta este inspirata de Game of Thrones. Poti, te rog, sa continui sa compui melodii triste despre cainele mort al vecinului sau in loc sa conceptualizezi tinute? Sau poate că este trauma de a pierde câinele, a cărui moarte nu este în mod clar de peste, deoarece el încă poartă carcasa lui.<br/><br/>Foaia de încărcare Outfit<br/><br/>Nimeni nu poate decide unde începe ținuta și unde se termină Abbas. Te uiți cu fascinație, scufundându-te într-un abis adânc și întrebându-te de ce poartă pantaloni de piele. Pe care cal a ucis-o pentru a fura șaua acoperită pe umeri? A fost în închisoare chiar înainte de apariția covorului roșu și a uitat să ia lanțurile? Cum va supraviețui pielii sintetice și erupției cutanate post-lemn care este obligat să fie letală în doze atât de mari? De ce sunt încă în viață?<br/><br/>Idee<br/><br/>Inspirația lui a fost aparent Game of Thrones, dar în cele din urmă a ajuns să arate ca și cum ar fi fost aruncat dintr-un restaurant viking. Dacă ar fi dat peste oricare dintre personajele din serial, ar fi fost ucis în primele cinci secunde ale primului episod.<br/><br/>Sănătatea mintală sau lipsa acesteia: Cineva îl duce la un consilier cât mai curând posibil! Se pare că se presupune că purtarea unui câine mort înseamnă că singurul prieten pe care l-a avut în viață este încă în viață. Dragă Abbas:<br/><br/>1. Negarea nu este un râu în Egipt<br/><br/>2. Psihicul dvs. torturat nu vă ajută muzica, deci obțineți ajutor<br/><br/>3. Încercați prieteni imaginari<br/><br/>Salvează-te!<br/><br/>Toți cei de la sediul Poliției de modă suntem grav traumatizați. Abbas este cineva pe care nu ne-a plăcut să-l arestăm. El este în prezent în custodie și încearcă să se răzbune prin punerea pe haine de la alte spectacole de fantezie. El pur și simplu s-a lipit pentru a arăta ca Edward Cullen din Twilight. Ca un mesaj de serviciu public și pentru a preveni alte căderi nervoase, i-am dat următoarele exemple de bărbați de pe covorul roșu al aceluiași eveniment.<br/><br/>Zohaib Hassan<br/><br/>Când ai dubii, joacă-te în siguranță. Cântăreața arată ca unchiul tău obișnuit la un shaadi. Un costum negru simplu fără accesorii, chiar dacă este un pic disproporționat, este fezabil. Aspectul lui Zohaib este amestecat în totul și nimic, iar atunci când nu aveți un simț al modei sau banii pentru a angaja un stilist, acest lucru este în regulă. Nu poartă riscul de stop cardiac pentru colegii participanți la un eveniment. Având în vedere starea mentală delicată a lui Abbas, acest aspect este ceea ce el ar trebui să urmărească.<br/><br/>Ali Zafar<br/><br/>Într-o zi, după decenii de terapie, Abbas ar putea aspira să poarte haine ca ale lui Ali Zafar. Aspectul de vară este făcut aproape la perfecțiune. Ali a ajuns foarte aproape de a arăta ca un maestru d într-un restaurant francez cu jacheta sa de vară albă cu reversuri negre, dar cămașa o salvează, nu contează satinul. Pantalonii lui ar fi fost ridicoli dacă nu ar fi fost pliați la glezne. Pantofii sunt ceea ce hipster chic finaluri fericite sunt făcute din. |
| Determining soil hydraulic properties with different wetting liquids : A thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the Degree of Master of Science at Lincoln University<br/><br/>Abstract<br/><br/>Soil hydraulic properties such as hydraulic conductivity, water retention and plant water relationships dominate the water movement processes. For example, the infiltration, evaporation and water flow within the soil. As a widespread phenomenon in soil, soil water repellency alters the soil hydraulic functions by resisting the water flow into the soils. Moreover, the hydraulic properties not only depend on the pore system of soil but also are affected by the physicochemical properties of the pore surfaces. Compared to water, ethanol is not affected by the water repellency due to its lower surface tension. The purpose of using ethanol is to eliminate the effect of soil water repellency on hydraulic properties measurements. However, applying pure ethanol into natural soil can degrade the soil organic materials and lead to changes in physical properties. Therefore, the aqueous ethanol solutions can be an alternative option. Nevertheless, the feasibility of using aqueous ethanol for determining soil liquid retention curve remains unknown. This study aims to test the feasibility of the aqueous ethanol solutions (0, 10 %, 20 %, 30 %, 40 %, 50 % and 100 % v/v) for establishing liquid retention curve under a small range of applied pressure in coarse sand samples with different wettability and organic amended natural soil (Templeton silt loam (TSL) with mushroom compost, biochar, dairy effluent, and municipal compost, the application rate was 15 % by weight). The result showed that the desorption of testing aqueous ethanol solutions compared to water was quicker by approximately 1 to 3x based on the liquid content at the same applied pressure and the time for reaching each equilibrium. The outcomes from the sand experiment suggested that when the concentration of aqueous ethanol solution was below 50 %, the losses via evaporation were less than 1% and the relative differences between testing liquid and water was lower than 10 %. However, the evaporation losses were 11.06 % and 24.6 %, and the relative differences were all around 15 % and 30 % in 50 % and 100 % ethanol solution, respectively. In contrast, the organic amendments in Templeton silt loam not only increased the water retention capability but also reduced the evaporation losses. The evaporation losses in TSL soil and TSL with organic amendments soil were with 1 % in solutions with less than 50 % ethanol content. Evaporation losses of 50 % and 100 % ethanol were 2.8 % and 2.9 %, respectively. The relative differences between water and testing liquid were similar to the sand experiment when the testing liquid concentrations were below 50 %. However, the relative differences in 50 % and 100 % ethanol solution were smaller than in the sand sample with around 10 % and 15%, respectively. Additionally, the analysis of relative difference suggested that almost all aqueous ethanol solutions had lower volumetric liquid content at the same supplied pressure compared to water, which was a reflection of the aqueous ethanol solutions desorbed faster than water under equivalent pressure. Therefore, 10 % to 40 % of ethanol solutions could be considered an alternative for determining soil hydraulic properties due to their faster desorption rate and not being affected by soil water repellency. Due to the evaporation and dissolution of organic material, aqueous ethanol solutions above 50% concentration were not suitable for coarse sand or medium-textured soil.... [Show full abstract] | Determinarea proprietăților hidraulice ale solului cu diferite lichide de umezire: o teză depusă în îndeplinirea parțială a cerințelor pentru gradul de Master of Science la Universitatea Lincoln<br/><br/>Abstract<br/><br/>Proprietățile hidraulice ale solului, cum ar fi conductivitatea hidraulică, retenția apei și relațiile plantelor cu apa, domină procesele de mișcare a apei. De exemplu, infiltrarea, evaporarea și fluxul de apă în sol. Ca fenomen larg răspândit în sol, rezistența la apă a solului modifică funcțiile hidraulice ale solului prin rezistența fluxului de apă în sol. Mai mult decât atât, proprietățile hidraulice nu depind numai de sistemul poros al solului, ci și de proprietățile fizico-chimice ale suprafețelor poroase. Comparativ cu apa, etanolul nu este afectat de rezistența la apă datorită tensiunii sale superficiale mai scăzute. Scopul utilizării etanolului este de a elimina efectul de repellere a apei din sol asupra măsurătorilor proprietăților hidraulice. Cu toate acestea, aplicarea etanolului pur în solul natural poate degrada materialele organice din sol și poate duce la modificări ale proprietăților fizice. Prin urmare, soluțiile apoase de etanol pot fi o opțiune alternativă. Cu toate acestea, fezabilitatea utilizării etanolului apos pentru determinarea curbei de retenție a lichidului din sol rămâne necunoscută. Acest studiu își propune să testeze fezabilitatea soluțiilor apoase de etanol (0, 10 %, 20 %, 30 %, 40 %, 50 % și 100 % v/v) pentru stabilirea curbei de retenție a lichidelor într-o gamă mică de presiuni aplicate în probe de nisip grosier cu umezibilitate diferită și sol natural modificat organic [loam de lut Templeton (TSL) cu compost de ciuire, biocar, efluent de lapte și efluent municipal. Rezultatul a arătat că desorbția soluțiilor apoase de etanol testate comparativ cu apa a fost mai rapidă cu aproximativ 1 până la 3 ori pe baza conținutului de lichid la aceeași presiune aplicată și a timpului pentru atingerea fiecărui echilibru. Rezultatele experimentului cu nisip au sugerat că, atunci când concentrația soluției apoase de etanol a fost sub 50 %, pierderile prin evaporare au fost mai mici de 1 %, iar diferențele relative între lichidul testat și apa au fost mai mici de 10 %. Cu toate acestea, pierderile prin evaporare au fost de 11,06 % și 24,6 %, iar diferențele relative au fost de aproximativ 15 % și 30 % în soluția de 50 % și, respectiv, 100 % în soluția de etanol. În contrast, amendamentele organice din lut Templeton nu numai că au crescut capacitatea de retenție a apei, dar au redus și pierderile de evaporare. Pierderile prin evaporare în solul TSL și în solul TSL cu modificări organice au fost de 1 % în soluții cu un conținut de etanol mai mic de 50 %. Pierderile prin evaporare de 50 % și 100 % etanol au fost de 2,8 % și, respectiv, 2,9 %. Diferențele relative dintre apă și lichidul de testare au fost similare cu experimentul cu nisip, atunci când concentrațiile lichidului de testare au fost sub 50 %. Cu toate acestea, diferențele relative în soluția de etanol 50 % și 100 % au fost mai mici decât în eșantionul de nisip, cu aproximativ 10 % și, respectiv, 15 %. În plus, analiza diferenței relative a sugerat că aproape toate soluțiile apoase de etanol au un conținut mai mic de lichid volumetric la aceeași presiune furnizată în comparație cu apa, care a fost o reflectare a soluțiilor apoase de etanol desorbit mai repede decât apa sub presiune echivalentă. Prin urmare, 10 % până la 40 % din soluțiile de etanol ar putea fi considerate o alternativă pentru determinarea proprietăților hidraulice ale solului, datorită ratei lor mai rapide de desorbție și a faptului că nu sunt afectate de rezistența la apă a solului. Datorită evaporării și dizolvării materialului organic, soluțiile apoase de etanol peste concentrația de 50% nu erau potrivite pentru nisip grosier sau sol cu textura medie....
