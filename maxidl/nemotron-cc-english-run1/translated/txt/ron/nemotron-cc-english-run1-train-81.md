| Forty-nine years ago today, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act of 1965.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Nearly a century ago, the 15th Amendment to the Constitution stated, "The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of race, color or previous condition of servitude." And nearly a century before that, our nation's founding fathers set in motion the great experiment of American democracy by declaring that "all men are created equal."<br/><br/>The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was a belated acknowledgment that even in America, our foundational ideals carry little weight if not protected by the rule of law. That's why Section 2 of the 15th Amendment granted Congress the "power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation."<br/><br/>And indeed, the codified language of the Voting Rights Act was able to achieve what the Reconstruction-era Congress and Thomas Jefferson could not. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act—and the civil rights movement from which they emerged—served as the catalyst for a dramatic increase in the opportunity for black Americans to participate in the democratic process.<br/><br/>For example, only 6.7 percent of eligible black Mississippians were registered to vote as of 1962; by 1969 that figure had reached 66.5 percent. Today, Mississippi has more black elected officials than any other state.<br/><br/>The protections put in place by the Voting Rights Act were long overdue when they were passed, representative of the arduous struggle with which they were achieved. But unthinkably, these protections are now under assault, jeopardizing the progress our nation worked so hard to achieve.<br/><br/>Last year, in the case of Shelby County v. Holder, the U.S. Supreme Court gutted a key component of the Voting Rights Act that enabled prior federal review to ensure nondiscrimination before any new voting law went into effect.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Sadly, the response of Republican leaders has been to do nothing. Sen. Ted Cruz and Gov. Rick Perry went out of their way to praise the Supreme Court's decision. Sen. Rand Paul dismissed the continued necessity of the Voting Rights Act by noting, "We have an African-American president."<br/><br/>While the election of President Barack Obama was indeed a historic milestone, it is dangerous to think that it absolves us from remaining vigilant against the lingering consequences of our nation's past. The haste with which states have moved to enact voting restrictions is confirmation that the protections put in place by Section 4 are still necessary.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Republican governors have signed strict photo-identification restrictions into law as the solution to a virtually nonexistent problem of voter impersonation, disproportionately hurting women, young people, working families and the African-American community. It's disingenuous for Republicans like Paul to seek the votes of these communities when they believe "there's nothing wrong with" putting restrictions in place that make it harder for these constituencies to vote.<br/><br/>Republicans have also sought to restrict early-voting periods, including the Sunday before Election Day, when African-American churches have had great success with Souls to the Polls programs.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>These restrictions represent a callous effort by Republicans to make voting harder, based on narrow, short-term political calculations that Republicans can win elections by shrinking the size of the electorate.<br/><br/>Democrats have a very different mission when it comes to voting: to ensure that every eligible voter can register, that every registered voter can vote and that every vote is accurately counted.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>The Democratic National Committee's Voter Expansion Project reflects our belief that greater voter participation strengthens our nation and our democracy. We'll continue to use our unmatched institutional knowledge to protect voting rights against legislation and tactics that would attempt to suppress the vote. And because the best defense is a good offense, we're also working to expand the vote by deploying our technology and data resources to register new voters.<br/><br/>On this anniversary, one of the best ways we can honor those who struggled—and in some cases gave their very lives—for the legislation's passage is for Republicans in Congress to join Democrats in passing the Voting Rights Amendment Act to restore the promise of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Democrat, represents Florida's 23rd Congressional District in the United States Congress. Since 2011, she has served as chair of the Democratic National Committee. Follow her on Twitter.<br/><br/>The Root aims to foster and advance conversations about issues relevant to the black Diaspora by presenting a variety of opinions from all perspectives, whether or not those opinions are shared by our editorial staff. | În urmă cu 49 de ani, președintele Lyndon B. Johnson a semnat Legea Drepturilor de Vot din 1965.<br/><br/>Anunțuri<br/><br/>Cu aproape un secol în urmă, cel de-al 15-lea amendament la Constituție a declarat: „Dreptul cetățenilor Statelor Unite de a vota nu va fi negat sau scurtat de Statele Unite sau de orice stat din cauza rasei, culorii sau condiției anterioare de servitute.” Și cu aproape un secol înainte de asta, părinții fondatori ai națiunii noastre au pus în mișcare marele experiment al democrației americane declarând că „toți oamenii sunt creați egali”.<br/><br/>Legea Drepturilor de Vot din 1965 a fost o recunoaștere tardivă că, chiar și în America, idealurile noastre fundamentale au o greutate mică, dacă nu sunt protejate de statul de drept. Acesta este motivul pentru care secțiunea 2 a celui de-al 15-lea amendament a acordat Congresului „puterea de a pune în aplicare acest articol prin legislație adecvată”.<br/><br/>Și într-adevăr, limbajul codificat al Legii Drepturilor de Vot a reușit să realizeze ceea ce Congresul din epoca Reconstrucției și Thomas Jefferson nu au putut. Legea Drepturilor Civile din 1964 și Legea Drepturilor de Vot – și mișcarea pentru drepturile civile din care au apărut – au servit ca un catalizator pentru o creștere dramatică a oportunității pentru americanii de culoare de a participa la procesul democratic.<br/><br/>De exemplu, doar 6,7% dintre negrii eligibili din Mississippi erau înregistrați pentru a vota în 1962; până în 1969, această cifră a ajuns la 66,5 procente. Astăzi, Mississippi are mai mulți oficiali aleși de culoare decât orice alt stat.<br/><br/>Protecțiile puse în aplicare de Legea Drepturilor de Vot erau de mult așteptate când au fost adoptate, reprezentative pentru lupta grea cu care au fost realizate.

| Q&A: Vatican safeguarding expert Fr Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>13 June 2021<br/><br/>Fr Hans Zollner SJ. Image: Australian Jesuits.<br/><br/>The President of the Centre for Child Protection at the Gregorian University in Rome, and a member of the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors, Fr Hans Zollner SJ, was in Australia in 2018 to speak to Catholic ministry leaders and survivors.<br/><br/>Michael McVeigh from Jesuit Communications sat down with him during the visit to explore how the Church is responding to the abuse crisis internationally, and what can be learned from our experiences in Australia.<br/><br/>MM: This is your third trip to Australia. You've visited quite a few other countries to see how the Church is responding to abuse around the world. Can you give us some idea of what the global picture looks like?<br/><br/>Fr Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>HZ: My understanding, after having visited about 50 countries on five or six continents, is that the Church is really starting to move over the last couple of years on the issue of doing justice to victims, of listening to them, and doing whatever can be done in terms of safeguarding.<br/><br/>I was with the Jesuit Provincials from all over Africa at the end of April, and the President of the Jesuit Assistancy of Africa and Madagascar is very much committed and dedicated to this. He has put up a thorough action plan for formation and for introducing guidelines all over the place. It's a very considerate and very deliberate effort to do whatever can be done to be proactively engaged as Jesuits in Africa — in a continent where until a few years ago all of this was a foreign language.<br/><br/>One of the challenges of trying to develop this global approach is that you're dealing with so many cultures, and so many different understandings. How do you bring this together and try to provide training and support religious communities tackling these issues?<br/><br/>This is one of the major questions we have. I think what I can do is stimulate discussion, stimulate reflection, and prepare people as much as possible so that they can do the groundwork.<br/><br/>The Centre for Child Protection at the Gregorian University does not pretend to have the response to every question. Not only because we don't know the specific contexts — we might know a few of them, but we're talking about thousands of cultures, we're talking about hundreds of languages, we're talking about very diverse legal backgrounds. It varies even sometimes within one country, such as Australia where you have states within the Commonwealth of Australia that have different laws than other states.<br/><br/>I am somebody who tries to elicit and stimulate discussion and reflection. I'm also very happy to listen to people.<br/><br/>You mentioned the need to listen and support victims in being heard. We've obviously had the Royal Commission here in Australia, but what are some of the other ways that you've seen that the voices of victims are being supported around the world?<br/><br/>In France there is one diocese that has established what they call 'The Listening Space'. There, victims can come forward and they can express themselves. The bishop is present. It's an open space in which people who have been hurt tremendously are free at least to express what they want to ask from the Church leadership etc.<br/><br/>There are other places in the USA or in other countries where victims have been invited by dioceses, by Provinces, by the leadership of the Church, to come forward. I have to say that overall I think there is a good will, and there are more people like bishops and provincials who listen to victims than we know. But there is no one model of giving victims not only the space to express themselves and be listened to, but also to engage actively in Church development.<br/><br/>In terms of setting up spaces for support for victims, what are some of the things you've seen that could really help — and that we could be considering here in Australia?<br/><br/>One of the major points that many victims bring up is, 'Can't we have, within parish settings, within schools settings, a regular conversation going on that includes survivors of abuse as regular members of a committee, a commission, a sounding board, a feedback group or something like that?' So that this voice is not only brought in on a specific occasion, or where a person feels like he or she is at a point to be able to speak out about it, but [is heard] on a regular basis — build that voice into the system.<br/><br/>That will help all of us. It will help survivors and victims because they will feel welcome and appreciated in the specific experience, and in the specific life challenges, that they went through. Secondly it will help the community at large, because we can at least make ourselves more and more sensitive to what the concerns and specific needs of survivors are — that can also talk to the needs of young people.<br/><br/>M: We have strong groups of survivors here in Australia who have been able to support each other through that process. But what you're saying is that we need some way of supporting those groups, and supporting those people, through our own institutions as well?<br/><br/>And I think we need to be creative. It will work for one school and one parish and one diocese in one way, and for others in a different way. Because the survivors with whom I am in constant contact, they have quite similar requests, and similar experiences in regard to being welcomed in the Church or not — feeling thrown out or dismissed. But they have also among themselves quite different expectations. So I have learned that you have also to be very forthcoming in accepting the differences in what this specific group, or this specific survivor, wants, requests and needs.<br/><br/>M: Survivors talk about wanting to have their stories heard and acknowledged. We've had the Royal Commission here in Australia, which provided an independent process where victims could come forward. Is there a need for something like that in terms of a truth, justice and reconciliation process for the Church internationally?<br/><br/>H: Yes, I think there is a need for that internationally. But I think first every local church needs to do its own homework. I don't see it happening very soon that some such council or commission would be established to look into this area for the whole Church. The Church has a membership of 1.3 billion people, and is present in 190 countries, with all kinds of differences in expectations concerning psychological, spiritual and financial support.<br/><br/>There is one thing that I have come across consistently in communicating with, working with and listening to victims, and that is that they want to be listened to. So if there was the feeling that victims were constantly being listened to — in Rome and elsewhere — I think that would give a great relief to many victims.<br/><br/>I think [Pope Francis'] concern, especially with regard to your question, is that the local churches do whatever they can so that victims will be listened to in that particular country. I have a list of people who want to speak to the Holy Father directly, and physically it is impossible. I was there in 2014 to translate for two German survivors who were chosen with two Irish and two English survivors when he received the six of them at home. He took the whole morning listening to them one after the other. For each one, he was there for 40 to 45 minutes. Were he to do this for every survivor he couldn't sleep anymore.<br/><br/>His example is modelling for the whole Catholic Church the way victims and survivors are received, welcomed and listened to. I think if the bishops and the provincials in this world, in all countries, followed his example, many survivors would be really appreciative of that.<br/><br/>Archbishop Diarmud Martin was recently quoted just before the World Meeting of Families, about the Pontifical Commission, saying that it's too small as it's currently set up to achieve what it needs to achieve. What's your take on that? Does the Church need to be putting more resources into how it's overseeing those issues?<br/><br/>At the moment we are 16 members from basically all continents, and the major language groups. We represent a variety of disciplines and professions, and the purpose of the commission — as the statutes that have just been promulgated state — is to provide counsel to the Holy Father.<br/><br/>A common misunderstanding about the commission is first that we deal with cases of allegations. That is not the case. We have no juridical or administrative power in regards to cases, because when it comes to allegations of abuse the tribunals and procedure are set.<br/><br/>A second misunderstanding is that we promote, directly, things on the ground. Our first and foremost goal is that we advise the Holy Father on issues.<br/><br/>So from my point of view, yes, we need to invest more. But we need to invest more on the local level, and we need to make sure that the proposals from the Pontifical Commission are forwarded to the Holy Father — which normally the President does — and then there is a follow-up process that reflects what we have given as our advice.<br/><br/>In Australia, Catholic Professional Standards Limited is overseeing the Church's response and providing guidelines and support for ensuring all the institutions in the Church are child-safe institutions. Is there a need for some kind of organisational support from Rome for those bishops and dioceses that are struggling to form these institutions and provide safeguarding in those dioceses?<br/><br/>I think ultimately the commission will develop in that line. They are now in the process of hiring experts in those areas.<br/><br/>I think the Church needs to understand that the local churches can learn from each other mutually. And my understanding has always been — and I think the Holy Father has reminded us — that the Church will not function as a centralised company. It does not work like that, effectively. Every bishop, every bishops conference, has, to some extent, its life on its own. What we need to learn more is to open channels of mutual communication.<br/><br/>There are a number of things that people blame for abuse in the Church. As a priest and a psychologist, and as someone who has met and worked with survivors, what are your thoughts on that issue?<br/><br/>I think the question of where does abuse come from is the most important one, and the Pope has addressed that in his letter to the people of God published on 20 August. He says in the first paragraph, and repeats it over and over again, that the question of sexual abuse is always linked — or almost always linked — not only to the question of abuse of power, but also to the abuse of conscience.<br/><br/>So the real fundamental question of abuse is much more complex than just [the question of] sexuality — be it heterosexual or homosexual. It's a power issue, and there we have to really work on the question of how do we understand priesthood, how to we understand bishophood, how do we understand and live out our ministries? What are the boundaries?<br/><br/>That's why I'm very happy that the Jesuit Province in Australia is establishing a Code of Conduct. Because we don't talk only about sexual abuse of minors. We talk about sexual abuse of adults, and we talk about abuse in other ways — like abuse of conscience, where you dictate to someone what you think, or you pretend to know by God, and you can tell another person, 'You need to do that', against the conscience of that person.<br/><br/>Many people think celibacy produces abuse. As I always say, celibacy as such is not cause for abusing — otherwise how do we explain that 99.9 per cent of all abusers do not live a celibate life, and how do we explain that 95 or 96 per cent of all priests do not abuse minors? But, celibacy, or a vow of chastity, that is not really integrated, that is not really lived out properly — yes, that produces a problem. Sometimes people take to drinking, sometime they take to gambling, and sometimes they take to sexual misconduct, with adults and with minors.<br/><br/>The real question about this is how do we deal with the notion of religious spiritual power with which priests and bishops are invested? How can theology help us to understand, and maybe how can sociology, psychology, or business administration help us to define the limits of power, and the necessity of keeping your boundaries | Întrebări și răspunsuri: Expertul în protecția Vaticanului, părintele Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>13 iunie 2021<br/><br/>Părintele Hans Zollner SJ. Imagine: Iezuiții australieni.<br/><br/>Președintele Centrului pentru Protecția Copilului de la Universitatea Gregoriana din Roma și membru al Comisiei Pontificale pentru Protecția Minorilor, părintele Hans Zollner SJ, a fost în Australia în 2018 pentru a vorbi cu liderii ministerului catolic și cu supraviețuitorii.<br/><br/>Michael McVeigh de la Comunicațiile iezuite a stat de vorbă cu el în timpul vizitei pentru a explora modul în care Biserica răspunde la criza internațională a abuzurilor și ce putem învăța din experiențele noastre din Australia.<br/><br/>MM: Aceasta este a treia ta călătorie în Australia. Ați vizitat destul de multe alte țări pentru a vedea cum răspunde Biserica la abuzurile din întreaga lume. Ne puteți da o idee despre cum arată imaginea globală?<br/><br/>Părintele Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>HZ: Înțeleg că, după ce am vizitat aproximativ 50 de țări de pe cinci sau șase continente, Biserica începe să se miște cu adevărat în ultimii doi ani pe tema de a face dreptate victimelor, de a le asculta și de a face tot ce se poate în ceea ce privește protejarea.<br/><br/>Am fost cu Provincialii iezuiţi din toată Africa la sfârşitul lunii aprilie, iar Preşedintele Asistenţei iezuite din Africa şi Madagascar este foarte dedicat şi dedicat acestui lucru. El a pus la punct un plan de acțiune amănunțit pentru formare și pentru introducerea orientărilor peste tot. Este un efort foarte atent și foarte deliberat de a face tot ce se poate face pentru a fi implicați proactiv ca iezuiți în Africa – într-un continent unde până acum câțiva ani toate acestea erau o limbă străină.<br/><br/>Una dintre provocările încercării de a dezvolta această abordare globală este că aveți de-a face cu atât de multe culturi și atât de multe înțelegeri diferite. Cum aduceți acest lucru împreună și încercați să oferiți instruire și să sprijiniți comunitățile religioase care abordează aceste probleme?<br/><br/>Aceasta este una dintre întrebările majore pe care le avem. Cred că ceea ce pot face este să stimulez discuția, să stimulez reflecția și să pregătesc oamenii cât mai mult posibil, astfel încât să poată face munca de bază.<br/><br/>Centrul pentru Protecția Copilului de la Universitatea Gregoriana nu pretinde că are răspunsul la fiecare întrebare. Nu doar pentru că nu cunoaștem contextele specifice -- s-ar putea să cunoaștem câteva dintre ele, dar vorbim despre mii de culturi, vorbim despre sute de limbi, vorbim despre medii juridice foarte diverse. Acesta variază chiar și uneori în cadrul unei țări, cum ar fi Australia, în cazul în care aveți state din cadrul Commonwealthului Australiei care au legi diferite de alte state.<br/><br/>Sunt cineva care încearcă să provoace și să stimuleze discuția și reflecția. Sunt, de asemenea, foarte fericit să ascult oamenii.<br/><br/>Ați menționat nevoia de a asculta și de a sprijini victimele în a fi ascultate. Evident, am avut Comisia Regală aici în Australia, dar care sunt alte modalități prin care ați văzut că vocile victimelor sunt susținute în întreaga lume?<br/><br/>În Franța există o dieceză care a stabilit ceea ce ei numesc „Spațiul de ascultare”. Acolo, victimele se pot prezenta și se pot exprima. Episcopul este prezent. Este un spațiu deschis în care oamenii care au fost răniți teribil sunt liberi cel puțin să exprime ceea ce vor să ceară de la conducerea Bisericii etc.<br/><br/>Există alte locuri în SUA sau în alte țări unde victimele au fost invitate de dieceze, de provincii, de conducerea Bisericii, să se prezinte. Trebuie să spun că, în general, cred că există o bună voință și sunt mai mulți oameni ca episcopii și provincialii care ascultă victimele decât știm. Dar nu există un singur model de a oferi victimelor nu numai spațiul pentru a se exprima și a fi ascultate, ci și pentru a se angaja activ în dezvoltarea Bisericii.<br/><br/>În ceea ce privește crearea de spații de sprijin pentru victime, care sunt unele dintre lucrurile pe care le-ați văzut care ar putea ajuta cu adevărat - și pe care le-am putea lua în considerare aici în Australia?<br/><br/>Unul dintre punctele majore pe care multe victime le aduc în discuție este: „Nu putem avea, în cadrul parohiei, în cadrul școlilor, o conversație regulată care să includă supraviețuitorii abuzului ca membri obișnuiți ai unui comitet, o comisie, un comitet de sondaj, un grup de feedback sau ceva de genul acesta?” Astfel încât această voce să nu fie adusă doar într-o anumită ocazie, sau în cazul în care o persoană simte că el sau ea este într-un punct în care este capabil să vorbească despre ea, dar [este auzit] în mod regulat - construiți acea voce în sistem.<br/><br/>Acest lucru ne va ajuta pe toți, îi va ajuta pe supraviețuitori și pe victime, pentru că se vor simți bineveniți și apreciați în experiența specifică și în provocările specifice de viață prin care au trecut. În al doilea rând, va ajuta comunitatea în general, pentru că ne putem face cel puțin din ce în ce mai sensibili la ceea ce sunt preocupările și nevoile specifice ale supraviețuitorilor – care pot vorbi și la nevoile tinerilor.<br/><br/>M: Avem grupuri puternice de supraviețuitori aici, în Australia, care au fost capabili să se sprijine reciproc prin acest proces. Dar ceea ce vrei să spui este că avem nevoie de o modalitate de a sprijini aceste grupuri și de a-i sprijini pe acei oameni, și prin propriile noastre instituții?<br/><br/>Și cred că trebuie să fim creativi. Va funcționa pentru o școală și o parohie și o dieceză într-un fel, și pentru alții într-un mod diferit. Deoarece supraviețuitorii cu care sunt în contact constant, au cereri destul de asemănătoare și experiențe similare în ceea ce privește primirea în Biserică sau nu – simțindu-se aruncați sau respinși. Dar ei au și între ei așteptări destul de diferite, așa că am învățat că trebuie să fiți foarte proactivi în acceptarea diferențelor în ceea ce acest grup specific, sau acest supraviețuitor specific, dorește, solicită și are nevoie.<br/><br/>M: Supraviețuitorii vorbesc despre dorința ca poveștile lor să fie auzite și recunoscute. Am avut o comisie regală aici în Australia, care a oferit un proces independent în care victimele puteau să se prezinte. Este nevoie de ceva de genul acesta în termeni de adevăr, justiție și proces de reconciliere pentru Biserică la nivel internațional?<br/><br/>H: Da, cred că este nevoie de asta la nivel internațional. Dar cred că mai întâi fiecare biserică locală trebuie să-și facă propria temă. Nu văd că se va întâmpla foarte curând ca un astfel de consiliu sau comisie să fie înființat pentru a cerceta această zonă pentru întreaga Biserică. Biserica are un număr de 1,3 miliarde de membri și este prezentă în 190 de țări, cu tot felul de diferențe în așteptări în ceea ce privește sprijinul psihologic, spiritual și financiar.<br/><br/>Există un lucru cu care m-am confruntat în mod constant în comunicarea, colaborarea și ascultarea victimelor, și anume că acestea doresc să fie ascultate. Deci, dacă ar exista sentimentul că victimele sunt ascultate în mod constant – la Roma și în altă parte – cred că ar fi o mare ușurare pentru multe victime.<br/><br/>Cred că preocuparea [Papa Francisc], mai ales în ceea ce privește întrebarea dumneavoastră, este că bisericile locale fac tot ce pot pentru ca victimele să fie ascultate în acea anumită țară. Am o listă de oameni care vor să vorbească direct cu Sfântul Părinte, iar fizic este imposibil. Am fost acolo în 2014 pentru a traduce pentru doi supraviețuitori germani care au fost aleși împreună cu doi supraviețuitori irlandezi și doi englezi când i-a primit pe cei șase acasă. El a petrecut toată dimineața ascultându-i unul după altul. Pentru fiecare, el a fost acolo timp de 40 până la 45 de minute. Dacă ar fi făcut asta pentru fiecare supraviețuitor nu ar mai putea dormi.<br/><br/>Exemplul său este modelarea pentru întreaga Biserică Catolică a modului în care victimele și supraviețuitorii sunt primiți, primiți și ascultați. Cred că dacă episcopii și provincialii din această lume, din toate țările, i-ar urma exemplul, mulți supraviețuitori ar aprecia cu adevărat acest lucru.<br/><br/>Arhiepiscopul Diarmud Martin a fost citat recent, chiar înainte de Întâlnirea Mondială a Familiilor, despre Comisia Pontificală, spunând că este prea mică pentru a realiza ceea ce trebuie să realizeze. Trebuie ca Biserica să pună mai multe resurse în modul în care supraveghează aceste probleme?<br/><br/>În acest moment, suntem 16 membri din practic toate continentele și grupurile lingvistice majore. Reprezentăm o varietate de discipline și profesii, iar scopul comisiei – ca statute care tocmai au fost promulgate de stat – este de a oferi sfatul Sfântului Părinte.<br/><br/>O neînţelegere comună cu privire la comisie constă mai întâi în faptul că ne ocupăm de cazurile de acuzaţii. Nu avem nicio putere juridică sau administrativă în ceea ce privește cazurile, deoarece atunci când vine vorba de acuzații de abuz, tribunalele și procedura sunt stabilite.<br/><br/>O a doua neînțelegere este că promovăm, direct, lucrurile pe teren. Scopul nostru principal este să-l sfătuim pe Sfântul Părinte cu privire la chestiuni.<br/><br/>Deci, din punctul meu de vedere, da, trebuie să investim mai mult. Dar trebuie să investim mai mult la nivel local și trebuie să ne asigurăm că propunerile Comisiei Pontificale sunt transmise Sfântului Părinte – ceea ce în mod normal face Președintele – și apoi există un proces de urmărire care reflectă ceea ce am dat ca sfatul nostru.<br/><br/>În Australia, Catholic Professional Standards Limited supraveghează răspunsul Bisericii și oferă orientări și sprijin pentru a se asigura că toate instituțiile din Biserică sunt instituții sigure pentru copii. Este nevoie de un fel de sprijin organizatoric din partea Romei pentru acei episcopi și dieceze care se străduiesc să formeze aceste instituții și să asigure protecția în acele dieceze?<br/><br/>Cred că, în cele din urmă, comisia se va dezvolta în această direcţie. Ei sunt acum în procesul de angajare a experţilor în aceste domenii.<br/><br/>Cred că Biserica trebuie să înțeleagă că bisericile locale pot învăța una de la cealaltă. Și înțelegerea mea a fost întotdeauna – și cred că Sfântul Părinte ne-a amintit – că Biserica nu va funcționa ca o companie centralizată. Nu funcționează așa, în mod eficient. Fiecare episcop, fiecare conferință a episcopilor, are, într-o oarecare măsură, viața sa pe cont propriu. Ceea ce trebuie să învățăm mai mult este să deschidem canale de comunicare reciprocă.<br/><br/>Există o serie de lucruri pe care oamenii le învinovățesc pentru abuzuri în Biserică. Ca preot și psiholog, și ca cineva care s-a întâlnit și a lucrat cu supraviețuitori, ce părere aveți despre această problemă?<br/><br/>Cred că întrebarea de unde provine abuzul este cea mai importantă, iar Papa a abordat-o în scrisoarea sa către poporul lui Dumnezeu publicată la 20 august. El spune în primul paragraf, și o repetă în mod repetat, că problema abuzului sexual este mereu legată – sau aproape întotdeauna legată – nu numai de problema abuzului de putere, ci și de abuzul de conștiință.<br/><br/>Deci adevărata problemă fundamentală a abuzului este mult mai complexă decât doar sexualitatea – fie ea heterosexuală sau homosexuală. Este o problemă de putere, și acolo trebuie să lucrăm cu adevărat la întrebarea cum înțelegem preoția, cum înțelegem episcopatul, cum înțelegem și trăim slujirile noastre? Care sunt limitele?<br/><br/>De aceea sunt foarte fericit că provincia iezuită din Australia stabileşte un cod de conduită, pentru că nu vorbim doar despre abuzul sexual asupra minorilor. Vorbim despre abuzul sexual asupra adulților, și vorbim despre abuz în alte moduri – cum ar fi abuzul de conștiință, în care îi dictezi cuiva ceea ce gândești, sau pretinzi că știi de la Dumnezeu, și poți spune altei persoane, „Trebuie să faci asta”, împotriva conștiinței acelei persoane.<br/><br/>Mulți oameni cred că celibatul produce abuz. Așa cum am spus mereu, celibatul ca atare nu este motiv de abuz – altfel cum explicăm că 99,9% dintre cei care abuzează nu duc o viață de celibat și cum explicăm că 95% sau 96% dintre toți preoții nu abuzează minori? Dar, celibatul, sau un jurământ de castitate, care nu este cu adevărat integrat, care nu este cu adevărat trăit în mod corespunzător – da, asta produce o problemă. Uneori oamenii beau, alteori joacă jocuri de noroc, iar alteori se comportă incorect sexual, cu adulți și cu minori.<br/><br/>Adevărata întrebare despre aceasta este cum ne ocupăm de noțiunea de putere spirituală religioasă cu care sunt investiți preoții și episcopii? Cum ne poate ajuta teologia să înțelegem și, poate, cum ne poate ajuta sociologia, psihologia sau administrarea afacerilor să definim limitele puterii și necesitatea de a-ți menține limitele |
| I'm not surprised by this mismatch. In fact, I'd even go so far as to say this isn't something that will ever change, nor should we get all steamed up about changing it. In 10 years, we'll still have bleeding edge, complex items in the biggest concerns list, and the things we're finally getting around to understanding will be the major parts of our spending.<br/><br/>Now, Gunnar and Andy both have excellent points, specifically about IT teams seeing IT problems and solving them with IT solutions; in fact, I'm positive their points hold merit.<br/><br/>But I think there are other ideas that trump those (I did comment on their blogs about it, and later decided I should just blog here). Those top 3 concerns are bleedingly new such that:<br/><br/>we fear new things because we don't understand them, or don't understand them because they're new.<br/><br/>they're too new for us to have solid approaches to handling them.<br/><br/>they're too new for us to know if we should be worried or not! we tend to default to paranoid/worried, which is good!<br/><br/>too new to have obvious budget items assigned to them. Can I buy a box or some software that provide "cloud security" or "social media security?"<br/><br/>they're so new the business doesn't even know how to use them or what they want out of them. Let alone how we can secure them while still meeting or at least not stomping all over business needs. If the business doesn't even know how to use them yet, I'm not sure security is in any position to guide that usage securely.<br/><br/>It also should be mentioned that these new things are being largely pushed via consumerland and into the business, with IT as a sort of, "Oh yeah," thought. Firewalls, AV, AM, Auth are all IT responses to typically IT issues. Of course there is a difference there. They're also very subjective issues, as opposed to very objective items like firewalls, known malicious bits, behaviors, signatures, ports. Business presents very complex issues that are often involving people (which we can't patch) and that often don't fit nicely into blanket rules. Even if we turned away from technical solutions and devoted our time into solving these problems, they are still not going to be neatly solved. Likewise, when push comes to shove, can you have and meet goals with firewalls? Can you show improvement? All of this flows from the rather subjective non-technical aspect of those issues. Sort of the difference between a child's report card and the feedback you get from a parent-teacher conference. If you have a child, which one would you be most inclined to disagree with or not necessarily believe? (The answer is the subjective one!)<br/><br/>It could be said this is the natural progression of security and technology: from shoring up the technical controls to moving up the stack towards behavior and people. Sure, these 3 top concerns can be said to punch through firewalls and network segments, but that's the nature of those things (social media "punching" through a firewall is far different than me punching through an SSH connection to bridge my home network; social media is akin to the *way* I use my SSH connection after the hold is already punched because it is needed; i.e. social media is the way port 80 is used.)<br/><br/>Basically, all indications point to not being surprised by this dichotomy. And I don't think this is some further indication that IT/security is doing it wrong, or isn't aligned properly with business, or has a technical dark-server-room background. I'm not saying we're doing things right or we're properly aligned, but the above isn't a good argument to support the theory of those deficiencies.<br/><br/>Now for a really big jump. I'd liken the current increase in mobile computing to be as big as the introduction of computers into the business and later the PC/internet into business. Now, I wasn't around when the former happened, nor was I in the industry when the personal computer revolution swept into business, but I would bet that is the closest comparison so far. I may even say the same for social media. These are damned new and they're big changes beyond just bringing in Macs or new software or some new business process. | Nu sunt surprins de această nepotrivire. De fapt, aș merge chiar atât de departe încât să spun că acest lucru nu este ceva care se va schimba vreodată, și nici nu ar trebui să ne aburim să-l schimbăm. În 10 ani, vom avea în continuare elemente complexe în lista celor mai mari preocupări, iar lucrurile pe care le vom înțelege în cele din urmă vor fi cele mai importante părți ale cheltuielilor noastre.<br/><br/>Acum, Gunnar și Andy au ambele puncte excelente, în special despre echipele IT care văd problemele IT și le rezolvă cu soluții IT; de fapt, sunt convins că punctele lor merită.<br/><br/>Dar cred că există și alte idei care le depășesc (am comentat pe blogurile lor despre asta, și mai târziu am decis că ar trebui să blogez aici). Aceste preocupări de top 3 sunt sângeroase noi, astfel încât:<br/><br/>Ne temem de lucruri noi pentru că nu le înțelegem sau nu le înțelegem pentru că sunt noi.<br/><br/>sunt prea noi pentru noi să avem abordări solide pentru a le gestiona.<br/><br/>sunt prea noi pentru ca noi să știm dacă ar trebui să fim îngrijorați sau nu! avem tendința implicită de a paranoic / îngrijorat, ceea ce este bine!<br/><br/>Pot cumpăra o cutie sau un software care oferă "securitate în cloud" sau "securitate în social media"?<br/><br/>sunt atât de noi încât afacerea nici măcar nu știe cum să le folosească sau ce vor de la ele. Să nu mai vorbim de modul în care le putem asigura în timp ce încă se întâlnesc sau cel puțin nu călcăm peste toate nevoile de afaceri. Dacă afacerea nici măcar nu știe cum să le folosească încă, nu sunt sigur că securitatea este în nici o poziție de a ghida în siguranță această utilizare.<br/><br/>De asemenea, ar trebui menționat faptul că aceste lucruri noi sunt în mare parte împinse prin intermediul terenurilor de consum și în afaceri, cu IT ca un fel de, "Oh da," gândit. Firewall-uri, AV, AM, Auth sunt toate răspunsuri IT la problemele tipice IT. Desigur, există o diferență acolo. Sunt, de asemenea, probleme foarte subiective, spre deosebire de elemente foarte obiective, cum ar fi firewall-uri, biți rău intenționați, comportamente, semnături, porturi. Afacerile prezintă probleme foarte complexe care implică adesea oameni (pe care nu le putem repara) și care adesea nu se încadrează bine în regulile generale. Chiar dacă ne-am îndepărtat de soluțiile tehnice și ne-am dedicat timpul rezolvării acestor probleme, ele tot nu vor fi rezolvate cu grijă. De asemenea, atunci când vine vorba de împingere, puteți avea și atinge obiectivele cu firewall-uri? Puteți arăta îmbunătățiri? Toate acestea decurg din aspectul mai degrabă subiectiv și non-tehnic al acestor probleme. Un fel de diferență între fișa de raportare a unui copil și feedback-ul pe care îl primiți de la o conferință părinte-profesor. Dacă ai un copil, pe care ai fi cel mai înclinat să nu fii de acord sau să nu crezi neapărat? (Răspunsul este subiectiv!)<br/><br/>S-ar putea spune că aceasta este progresul natural al securității și al tehnologiei: de la consolidarea controalelor tehnice la creșterea stivei către comportament și oameni. Desigur, aceste 3 preocupări de top pot fi spuse să lovească prin firewall-uri și segmente de rețea, dar aceasta este natura acestor lucruri (social media "punching" printr-un firewall este mult diferită de mine pumnând printr-o conexiune SSH pentru a-mi conecta rețeaua de acasă; social media este asemănătoare cu *way * folosesc conexiunea SSH după ce deționarea este deja folosită pentru că este necesară; adică social media este portul 80).<br/><br/>Practic, toate indicațiile indică faptul că nu sunt surprinși de această dihotomie. Și nu cred că acesta este un alt indiciu că IT / securitate face greșit, sau nu este aliniat în mod corespunzător cu afacerile, sau are un fundal tehnic de cameră întunecată. Nu spun că facem lucrurile bine sau că suntem aliniați în mod corespunzător, dar cele de mai sus nu sunt un argument bun pentru susținerea teoriei acestor deficiențe.<br/><br/>Acum, pentru un salt foarte mare. Aș compara creșterea actuală a calculatoarelor mobile să fie la fel de mare ca și introducerea calculatoarelor în afaceri și mai târziu a PC-ului / internetului în afaceri. Acum, nu am fost în preajma când s-a întâmplat primul, nici nu am fost în industrie când revoluția calculatoarelor personale a intrat în afaceri, dar pun pariu că aceasta este cea mai apropiată comparație până acum. Aș putea spune chiar același lucru pentru social media. Acestea sunt al naibii de noi și sunt schimbări mari, dincolo de a aduce Mac-uri sau software nou sau un nou proces de afaceri. |
