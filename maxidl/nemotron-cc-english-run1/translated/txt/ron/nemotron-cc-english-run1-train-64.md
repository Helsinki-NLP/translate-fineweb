| Smith Chuck - Through the Bible C2000 SeriesShall we turn to the book of Acts, chapter one, as we begin our study of the early church.<br/>Luke, the author of the book of Acts, a companion of Paul the apostle, who was author also of the Gospel According to Luke, wrote these two treatises to a friend, Theophilus. Theophilus is a Greek name. It's a name that has a beautiful meaning. The name means lover of God. There are some who believe that it was not a man at all, but that the gospel and the book of Acts were addressed to the lovers of God, whoever you may be. There are other traditions that say that Theophilus was actually Luke's master. That in those days physicians were slaves, usually the slave of a wealthy patron. So that Luke's master was Theophilus, and he released Luke to be with Paul on the missionary journeys. Thus, Luke is writing back to his former master. This is an early tradition of the church, but it is, of course, impossible to prove, like so many of the traditions.<br/>There are also those who believe that when Paul was in Troas and he received a vision of a man calling unto him saying, "Come over to Macedonia and help us," that that man in Paul's vision was none other than Luke. For the first one that Paul really met when he came to Macedonia was Luke. And as we are in the book of Acts, you will find that when we get to that portion of the book of Acts, Luke begins to write more in the first person rather than the third person. So it is, evidently, at this particular point in the Acts of the Apostles that Luke became a companion of Paul and began to journey with him. He began to use the pronouns "we" and "us" instead of "they" and "them." This is, no doubt, where Luke became a participant and an eyewitness of those things that were happening from this point on. We will bring this out to you when we get to that point.<br/>He begins the Acts of the Apostles by tying it with the Gospel According to Luke. It is interesting that the very last thing that Luke records in his gospel is the very first thing he records in the Acts of the Apostles. We find the gospel of Luke closing as Jesus is telling His disciples to wait in Jerusalem until they be endued with power from on high. And then Jesus ascended up into heaven, and so he closes the gospel. In opening the Acts of the Apostles, he writes,<br/>The former treatise [that is, the Gospel According to Luke,] have I written unto you, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and teach ( Act 1:1 ),<br/>The key word is began. The Gospel According to Luke is not the full story of the ministry of Jesus Christ. It is only the beginning of the ministry of Jesus Christ. Jesus continues to minister to the needs of people. Jesus continues to heal the sick. Jesus continues to raise the dead. Jesus continues to minister His love and His gospel to the world, only now He is ministering through those disciples who have been anointed with His Holy Spirit. But the ministry of Christ is continuing; basically, is the premise that Luke takes in the Acts of the Apostles. The former treatise of all that Jesus began, both to do and to teach.<br/>Now because of that, the Acts of the Apostles is an unfinished book: in that the Lord today continues to work through the lives of those who have dedicated themselves to be the instruments of God. To be led and guided and anointed by His Holy Spirit, to continue the ministry of Jesus in the world today. Now God has ordained that His work should be accomplished through human instruments. I do not say that it must be accomplished. God can use angelic beings for His work, and there will come a time, during the book of Revelation when God will use angels to proclaim His gospel to people all over the world. Revelation, chapter 14, "The first angel flying through the midst of heaven having the everlasting gospel" ( Rev 14:6 ). But at the present time, God has chosen to use human instruments. As imperfect as they may be, yet that's what God has ordained to use. The exciting thing about that is, God will use me and God will use you. So many times, we're begging off, "O Lord, I can't speak. I've never been able to speak before or even now, Lord." As Moses tried to beg off the call of God. Jeremiah said, "Lord, I'm just a kid; no one's going to listen to me." And we all have our excuses why we can't be used. Don't we? We all know the reasons why God couldn't use us.<br/>One time, as the Lord was calling a prophet to do His work, he said, "Lord, send whoever you want." The Lord said, "Hey, I've called you." "Lord, good idea; send whoever you want." So often we're in that position, "Lord, send by the hand of whomsoever you will, anybody but me Lord." And yet, God has ordained to use us.<br/>Now, each of us can show our own imperfections. Each of us can point out our own inabilities, and all of us can find an excuse why God wouldn't want to use me. But yet, God has chosen to use you. That through your life He might reveal Himself to a needy world. You wonder when God has such instruments to use how He ever got the job done, don't you?<br/>Until the day in which he was taken up, after that he through the Holy Spirit had given commandments to the apostles whom he had chosen ( Act 1:2 ):<br/>That is what he ended the Gospel of Luke with. The day that Jesus was taken up, after He had told the apostles to wait for the endowment of power.<br/>To whom he also [that is the apostles he also] showed himself alive to them after his passion [or death] by many infallible proofs ( Act 1:3 ),<br/>It is difficult to deny the fact of the resurrection of Jesus Christ. I was amused, as well as annoyed and irritated, by an article I read in the Santa Ana Register this last Saturday. Of the creation science and evolutionary theories being presented in the county schools. How that, this one professor said that he teaches a science class, and thus, they deal only in facts, and that they don't have any place for theories. Because science is based upon fact and creation is based upon religious superstitions. It takes a lot of faith to believe the religious theories. When you are dealing with facts, you can just accept them. I thought, "Very interesting in that science class, they taught me it was a fact that the world was four billion years old. Now today they are teaching it's a fact that the world is twelve billion years old. And it wasn't that long ago that I went to school."<br/>It's interesting that the Bible has never needed to be revised or updated to meet the current data that men have discovered. And yet, if you would take my high school science textbooks today and try to teach a science class from them, you would find that many of the things that were taught as scientific fact when I was in high school are no longer recognized as scientific fact. The simple cell protoplasm is no longer a simple cell, but extremely complex. If there is any fact that can be attested to in history it is the fact of the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.<br/>We have a jurisprudence system that is based upon the testimony of witnesses. If a man is accused of a crime and there are people who witnessed that crime while it was being committed, and they are brought to the standard, and they swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help them God. And in their questioning they affirm that, "I saw that man in the bank on May twenty-third. I saw him pull out a gun from his coat. I heard him demand that all of the money be given to him. I saw him as he left the bank. I saw him as the officer apprehended him outside." And if you can get three or four witnesses to point to that man and will keep their testimony under cross-examination, that man is judged to be guilty. He is the one who did it. We have two or three witnesses that are testifying the same story about that man, and it is accepted as fact that he is the one who perpetrated the crime and is guilty. You've got witnesses who have sworn to tell the truth that are verifying.<br/>After the death of Jesus, when He rose again, He appeared unto many different people who gave sworn testimony that they saw Him. That they talked to Him, that He appeared to them in various places under different circumstances. And for a period of forty days was visiting with them. And at one time, up to as many as five hundred people who were gathered at one place, He appeared. It's difficult to just cast aside or deny the witness of these people. To do so is to discredit our whole jurisprudence system. But not only that, these men who testified that they saw the risen Lord, that they talked to Him, that they ate with Him, they, all of them, with the exception of one, met violent deaths at the hands of other people because of their affirming that the story they told was true. You talk about witnesses sworn to tell the truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth. If a person's life was threatened because of that witness, and it was a lie, at least one them would've broken under the pressure. They would've confessed to the entire hoax. "He showed Himself alive after His passion by many infallible proofs."<br/>being seen of them for forty days, speaking to them of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God ( Act 1:3 ):<br/>Sometimes we fault the disciples because of their questions of the timing of the kingdom of God. Let it be remembered that the kingdom of God was the favorite subject of Jesus Christ. He was always talking about the kingdom of God, and it is a great hope that He was planting into the hearts of all men. Things are not always going to continue corrupted as they are. The world is not going to go forever under the power of darkness, under the bondage of evil. God is going to one day establish His kingdom upon the earth. A kingdom of righteous joy and peace. "Jesus shall reign, where ere the sun doth her successive journeys run. And His kingdom will extend from shore to shore." And that day will be the most glorious day the world has ever seen, as sickness and suffering and pain will be abolished in His kingdom. As sin and greed and these things that have made the world such an intolerable place will be abolished in His kingdom. The godless commercialism, the exploitation of man, all of these things abolished in His glorious kingdom when He reigns. No wonder the disciples were anxious to get it on. I'm anxious to get it on; I'm anxious for His kingdom to come. And Jesus told us when we pray, the first petition is, "Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven" ( Mat 6:10 ). This is the right kind of a desire that we should all have. I desire the kingdom of God. And so He was talking to them, during this forty-day period, of the kingdom.<br/>And, being assembled together with them, he commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which, saith he, you have heard of me ( Act 1:4 ).<br/>He said, "Now look, wait here in Jerusalem until you receive the promise of the Father." This promise that He is referring to is, no doubt, the promise in Joel where the Lord promised, "And it shall come to pass in the later days, saith the Lord, that I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and daughters will prophesy, and your young men shall dream dreams, your old men shall see visions: and upon my servants and my handmaidens shall I pour out my Spirit, saith the Lord" ( Joe 2:28-29 ). The promise of the Father: the day is going to come when God is going to pour out His Spirit upon all flesh, all of the believers. They will, each one, receive that dynamic from God.<br/>For John [He said,] truly baptized with water; but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now ( Act 1:5 ).<br/>The idea of baptism was that of emersion, the bapteedzo. John baptized with water, submerged the people in water, "you're going to be submerged in the Holy Spirit in not many days."<br/>Now when they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, will you at this time restore the kingdom to Israel? ( Act 1:6 )<br/>"When is it going to be, Lord? When's the time for this restoration?" And Jesus is talking to them now, not about the kingdom, but about the power that they're going to receive for service. And so He brushes aside their question.<br/>Saying unto them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father has put in his own power ( Act 1:7 ).<br/>"It's not for you to know." They lived constantly in the anticipation of the immediate setting up of the kingdom. During the entire lifetime of Jesus, they were expecting Him at any moment to go into the phone booth and come out as the savior of the world. Shazzam! Showing His power and overthrowing the governments of the world, establishing God's kingdom upon the earth. And they were waiting daily for this change to transpire. And whenever Jesus would talk about going to Jerusalem, being turned over into the hands of sinful man, and then being crucified, "Oh, oh no, Lord. No, no you don't understand the kingdom, Lord. Be that far from Thee." When Jesus died on the cross, they were all greatly disappointed.<br/>The two disciples on the road to Emmaus, so sad. "Hey, fellows. How come you're so sad as your walking along?" "What do you mean? You must be a stranger around here if you don't know the things that have been happening lately in Jerusalem." "What things?" "Oh, a fellow by the name of Jesus of Nazareth...oh man, it was mighty and powerful. The anointing of God was upon His life. We had hoped that in Him was the deliverance of Israel, but they crucified Him. We had hoped . . . now it's dead." Now He's risen, and He's saying, "In a few days, fellows, you're going to receive the promise of the Father." "Oh, what promise? The promise of the establishing of the kingdom?" You see, it was legitimate that they should ask. "Is this it Lord? Alright! Is this the time? Are you going to set up your kingdom now?" "No. It's not for you to know those times that the Father's appointed or that the Father has in His own power. But, you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you."<br/>Now here, the Greek preposition epi is used to signify a new relationship that they were to have with the Holy Spirit. In the Gospel According to John, chapter 14, as Jesus is there promising to send the Holy Spirit, He said, "I will not leave you comfortless. I will come to you, and I will pray the Father, and He will send to you another comforter, even the Spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth Him not neither knows Him, but you know Him for He dwells with you, and He shall be in you" ( Joh 14:17-18 ). Same Greek preposition as ours, only they spell it "en" instead of "in." Two-fold relationship there in John: He is with you, but He's going to be dwelling in you. But now Jesus said you're going to receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you. The Greek preposition epi, which is translated in different texts throughout the New Testament as "upon" or "over" or I like it, "overflows."<br/>In the seventh chapter of the gospel of John: "On the last day, the great day of the feast when Jesus stood there on the Temple Mount and cried to the people, 'If any man thirst let him come unto Me and drink: and he who drinks of the water that I give, out of his innermost being there will gush torrents of living water.'" John said, "This spake He of the Spirit, which was not yet given which they who believe on Him should receive" ( Joh 7:37-39 ). What did He speak of the Spirit? That it would be like a torrent of living water flowing out. I like, "When the Spirit overflows you," upon you, or over you, or overflows from you. So the three-fold relationship: He is with you prior to your conversion, He is the one who causes you to realize that you are a sinner, He is the one who points to Jesus Christ as the answer as He convinces the world of sin, of righteous, and of judgment. The moment you open your life and heart to Jesus Christ and invite Him to come in, the Holy Spirit comes and begins to indwell you. He shall be in you. "Know ye not that you are not your own, you have been bought with a price, therefore glorify God in your body and your spirit which are His. And know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit which is in you? Be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess, but be filled, or be ye being filled with the Spirit" ( 1Co 6:19-20 ,Eph 5:18 ). But now here's a third relationship. This is an empowering experience.<br/>You will receive [the dunamus] the dynamics, when the Holy Spirit has come [epi] upon you [or over you, or when there is that overflow from you]: and ye shall be witnesses unto me ( Act 1:8 )<br/>And so the dynamic, to be a witness for Jesus Christ. It is interesting that the word witness in Greek is the word martus from where we get our word martyr. And in Greek it does mean martyr. A witness is one who not only proclaims what he believes, he lives what he believes, he is what he believes, and he believes it so strongly, that if necessary, he'll die for what he believes. That's how strong is his belief. He's a martus. You can't stop him. He's not afraid to die for what he believes.<br/>You remember when Paul was on his way back to Jerusalem and Agabus came down from Caesarea and he took Paul's girdle and tied himself up and he said, "So is the man who owns this girdle to be bound when he gets to Jerusalem." And Paul's friends began to weep, saying, "Oh, Paul, don't go, don't go." And he said, "What do you mean by these tears? Do you think you're going to dissuade me? Do you think I'm worried about being bound? I'm ready to die." He was a martus. "I'm ready to die." Being put to death for your faith did not make you a martyr; because you were a martyr, you were put to death. Because you were a witness, because you believed it so strong. So, it did not make you a witness, it only proved what you were. You were a witness all along. If you hadn't been a martus, you would've never gone to your death. You would've recanted; you would've said, "Whoa, whoa, wait, wait. Hold on, let's change course here. I think that I may have made a mistake." Then you say, "Well, he wasn't a martus. Stealing a horse doesn't make you a horse thief; it only proves that you were. No one steals a horse unless he's a horse thief. So, stealing it doesn't make you a horse thief, it only proves that you were all along. Being martyred only proves what you were a witness, a martus. "And you will be witnesses." And isn't it interesting that most of them were martyred? "Witnesses unto Me."<br/>The witness was to be both in Jerusalem, and in all of Judea ( Act 1:8 ),<br/>The witness began right at home. The hardest place, isn't it? It's to start right at home in Jerusalem, and then the area around Jerusalem, the area of Judea. And then it was to spread up into Samaria. And then it was to go out into the uttermost parts of the world. And as we study the book of Acts, we will see this very progression. How the witness began in Jerusalem. We'll get that in the next chapter. And then we'll see how it began to spread through out Judea. And then Phillip went up into Samaria, and then finally Paul and Barnabas are called to go into the uttermost parts of the world. And so the witness spread through the anointing and the empowering of the Holy Spirit.<br/>Now when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight ( Act 1:9 ).<br/>This is the final promise made by Jesus to His disciples. This is it, the final words prior to His ascension. Of course, later He came and talked to Paul and others, but prior to His ascension, this is His final word. And upon this, when He had spoken these things, while they were watching Him, He was taken up and a cloud received Him out of their sight.<br/>And while they were looking steadfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, there were two men who stood by them in white apparel ( Act 1:10 );<br/>We assume they were angels.<br/>Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as you have seen him go into heaven ( Act 1:11 ).<br/>They saw Him as He ascended up into heaven and they will behold Him when He comes again. "Behold the Lord cometh with ten thousands of His saints, to execute judgement upon the earth" (Jud 1:14-15). And then, "Unto Him who loved us and gave Himself for us and who has made us unto our God, kings and priests who shall reign with Him upon the earth, behold the Lord cometh, and every eye shall see Him, and they also who pierced Him shall mourn" Rev 1:5-7 ). So the Lord's coming. Every eye shall see Him. The Jehovah Witnesses say that He is already come, but it was a secret coming. As it was only the disciples that saw Him go, it was only the disciples, of the Jehovah Witnesses, who saw Him return. But Jesus said, "If they say unto you, 'He has come in secret and has gone into a secret chamber don't believe it'" ( Mat 24:26 ). So you have to choose, to believe Jesus or them.<br/>"This same Jesus which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as you've seen Him go into heaven."<br/>Now there's a very interesting verse in II John, verse Act 1:7 , "For many deceivers are entered into the world who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh." That, unfortunately, is a poor translation of the Greek. For this participle is in the present tense and should be translated "is coming in the flesh." Those who would deny that Jesus Christ is coming in the flesh. What does John say of them? "They are a deceiver and an antichrist. Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward. For whosoever transgresses and abides not in the doctrine of Christ, has not God. He that abides in the doctrine of Christ, he has both the Father and the Son. And if there come any unto your door (on Saturday morning) and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, and neither bid him good-bye. For he that bids him good-bye is a partaker of his evil deeds" (2Jn 1:7-11). Ask them one question, "Is Jesus coming in the flesh?" Just ask them that question. And if they say no, just remember what John warned you and what John told you. "If any confess not that Jesus Christ is coming in the flesh." Do you remember when He was with the disciples and He said, "Give me something to eat"? He said, "You know, spirits don't eat; touch me. See? It's me." So, this same Jesus is coming again in the same manner in which they saw Him go into heaven. And I, for one, believe that that coming is very soon.<br/>Then retuned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a Sabbath's day journey [about two-thirds of a mile]. And when they were come in, they went up into an upper room, where there abode both Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, and Phillip, and Thomas, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon Zelotes, and Judas the brother of James. And these all continued in one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers ( Act 1:12-14 ).<br/>This is the last mention of Mary the mother of Jesus. At this point and from this point on, there is no further mention of her in the Acts of the Apostles or in the epistles. No mention of her death or of her miraculous ascension into heaven, without death. Nothing is mentioned in the scripture. It is silent.<br/>His brethren would be a reference probably to James and to Jude and to those other brothers who were sons of Joseph and Mary.<br/>The upper room--there are some who say that it is the same upper room in which Jesus had the Last Supper with His disciples. And yet, there are others who hold to this upper room being a room in the temple precincts where the early church met. Take your choice.<br/>And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples, and said, (the number of their names together were about one hundred and twenty,) men and brethren, this Scripture must needs have been fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit by the mouth of David spake before concerning Judas, which was a guide to those who took Jesus ( Act 1:15-16 ).<br/>Here again, Peter still his same impetuous self. They're waiting in prayer and supplication, and Peter stands up and says, "Fellows, there's a scripture that's gotta be fulfilled." And you know he's going to move ahead, "Let's get the program going; let's cast lots and find out who's going to take Judas' place." I do feel that Peter was again in the flesh, manifesting that impetuous nature that was his. And I think that the future history of the church in the book of Acts points this out. I am interested in Peter's understanding of the scriptures, how that he is quoting from so many places in the Old Testament. Peter does manifest a very great understanding of the Old Testament scriptures which is a point in his favor.<br/>Notice that Peter ascribes to the Holy Spirit those things that David wrote. So that, "All scripture is given by inspiration of God" ( 2Ti 3:16 ). Not part of the scriptures. Because, if you tell me that part of the scriptures are given by inspiration of God, then I must ask you, "What parts are by inspiration and what parts are not by inspiration?" And then you are then the authority who tells me what part I can believe and what part I can't believe. And the minute that God is no longer the authority but you're the authority, I'm in trouble. Beware of those who say, "Well, you can't believe all of the scriptures." The scriptures themselves say, "All scripture is given by inspiration of God." And here, Luke in writing of what Peter was saying, declares that David was actually the spokesman for the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit, by the mouth of David, spake concerning Judas.<br/>For he was numbered with us, [he was one of the twelve] he had obtained a part of this ministry. But now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity; and falling headlong ( Act 1:17-18 ),<br/>He purchased the field, the potter's field as Zachariah the eleventh chapter declares.<br/>and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all of his bowels gushed out ( Act 1:18 ).<br/>There are those who find a discrepancy in the scriptures, because in one of the gospels we are told that when Judas came back and tried to return the money, and they said, "Hey, it's your problem. We can't take it." And put it back in the temple treasury. "It's blood money." Then he threw it there on the floor of the temple and he went out and hung himself. Here Peter tells us that he fell headlong and just popped. And there are those who imagine a discrepancy. Very simple, he went up into the tree to hang himself, tied the rope around his neck and tied it to the limb and jumped. And the force of the fall either snapped the rope or his head, and he fell on down into the canyon and just as he said it here.<br/>It was known to all of the dwellers at Jerusalem; insomuch that the field is called in their tongue, Aceldama, that is to say, The field of blood. For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be desolate, and let no man dwell therein: and, His bishoprick let another take ( Act 1:19-20 ).<br/>Now in reality he's quoting from two different Psalms here. From Psa 69:25 ,he puts it together with Psa 109:8 . And putting the two together he finds these prophecies concerning Judas.<br/>Wherefore of these men ( Act 1:21 )<br/>Now here is where they are looking for someone to take Judas' place to be an apostle. Here are the qualifications they looked for in that time.<br/>Wherefore of these men which have companied with us all the time that the Lord Jesus when in and out among us ( Act 1:21 ),<br/>Now you remember there were many disciples, many disciples of which Jesus chose ten to be apostles. And the word apostle means "one who is sent out." Or chose twelve to be apostles, so He sent out the twelve. The number of human government. "We only have eleven. We need one to take Judas' place, but we need one who has been with us all the while from the beginning with Jesus."<br/>From the time he was baptized by John, until the day he was taken up from us, must one be ordained to be a witness [of what?] of His resurrection ( Act 1:22 ).<br/>So these were the requirements they were looking for. Someone who had been around the whole while. From the time of John's baptism to the ascension. And one who saw the risen Lord, and thus could bear fact of the resurrection, their testimony to the fact.<br/>Now Paul the apostle, later in asserting the fact that he was an apostle said, "Have I not seen the risen Christ?" Evidently that was one of the requirements of apostleship. Someone asked me, "Are there apostles today?" Well, I don't know. I don't think that there are in the same sense that they were in the New Testament. Surely there is none today who can bear witness to the resurrection as they did.<br/>They appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias. And they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord, which knowest the hearts of all men, show whether of these two that you have chosen ( Act 1:23-24 ),<br/>I think that we often make this mistake of giving the Lord two choices, both wrong. Limiting God, you see. We're so prone to do this. Obviously, Paul was God's choice. Peter was impetuous, and jumping the gun said, "Hey, we've got to do something, you know, gotta help God out. You know, one's missing and we've got to fill him in." And yet, "God, which one of these two do you want?" And giving God the two choices.<br/>That he may take part of this ministry and this apostleship, from which Judas by the transgression fell, that he might go to his own place. And so they gave forth their lots ( Act 1:25-26 );<br/>An interesting way by which they sought to determine the will of God. Let's throw dice, find out what God's will is here. It's interesting to me, the various ways that people have devised to discern the will of God. Now, in the Old Testament times they had an interesting way of coming to the priest, who would inquire of the Lord for them through the Urim and the Thummim, the "lights and perfections." Just what these Urim and Thummim were, we don't know. I'm sure they were not the colored glasses that Joseph Smith found with the Golden Tablets; the magic glasses, that when you put them on, you could suddenly read the hieroglyphic writing.<br/>There are those who say that the Urim and Thummim were actually a black and a white stone that was worn in a pouch on the chest of the priest. They would pray and ask the Lord a particular question. You remember that David was asking the Lord definite questions: "Lord, shall we go out against the Philistines?" The answer was, "No." So again, the next day, "Lord, shall we go out against the Philistines?" The answer was, "Yes." "When shall we go?" They would ask specific questions, and the Lord would direct them through the Urim and the Thummin. They say that the priest would pray, seek God, and then reach in and pull out one of the two stones. If it was the white stone, it was a yes answer. If it was a no, then it would be the black stone that he would pull out. Some even say we get the term blackballed from this Urim and Thummim. Actually, back in the original it is a no vote against a particular project or idea. Just what the Urim and Thummim were, we don't know. But during the Old Testament period, they did use a method of casting lots to determine the will of God.<br/>So here the disciples are picking up on the same thing as they are throwing the dice to see which of the two fellows that God had chosen to replace Judas Iscariot.<br/>the lot fell on Matthias; he was numbered with the eleven ( Act 1:26 ).<br/>Now who in the world is Matthias? No one ever heard of him before or since. It'll be interesting to meet Matthias and find out who he is and what he did. I think from the subsequent history, it's obvious to assume that God chose Paul as an apostle. Paul declares it himself. Now this is the last time we ever read of them seeking to discern the will of God by the casting of lots or by a chance kind of a thing.<br/>I know a fellow today, in seeking to discern the will of the Lord, will pray and ask the Lord a question. He'll have ten pennies in his pocket, and as he's praying, he'll take the pennies with his eyes closed and put them down on the table, and if they all come up heads, it's a yes. An interesting thing, every once in a while, they'll all come up heads, and that's pretty good odds. Yet, we don't find any pattern for this after the Holy Spirit was given. Once the Holy Spirit came upon the church, then the Holy Spirit began to speak to them and direct them. And the Holy Spirit said, "Separate unto me Paul and Barnabas for the ministry where I have called them" ( Act 13:2 ). And the Holy Spirit sent them forth. So we find the church more directly guided by the Holy Spirit. Once the Holy Spirit came, this throwing dice to find out the will of God was set aside.<br/>"<br/><br/>King James Version<br/><br/>This is the 1769 King James Version of the Holy Bible (also known as the Authorized Version). "Public Domain" | Smith Chuck - Prin seria C2000 a Bibliei Să ne întoarcem la cartea Faptele Apostolilor, capitolul unu, pe măsură ce începem studiul bisericii timpurii.<br/>Luca, autorul cărții Faptele Apostolilor, un tovarăș al apostolului Pavel, care a fost autor și al Evangheliei după Luca, a scris aceste două tratate unui prieten, Teofil. Teofil este un nume grecesc. Este un nume care are un sens frumos. Sunt unii care cred că nu a fost un om deloc, ci că Evanghelia şi cartea Faptelor Apostolilor au fost adresate iubitorilor lui Dumnezeu, oricine aţi fi. Există şi alte tradiţii care spun că Teofil a fost de fapt stăpânul lui Luca, că pe vremea aceea medicii erau sclavi, de obicei sclavii unui patron bogat. Astfel că stăpânul lui Luca a fost Teofil, iar el l-a eliberat pe Luca pentru a fi cu Pavel în călătoriile misionare. Astfel, Luca îi scrie înapoi fostului său stăpân. Aceasta este o tradiție timpurie a bisericii, dar este, desigur, imposibil de dovedit, ca multe dintre tradiții.<br/>Mai sunt şi cei ce cred că, pe când Pavel era în Troa, a avut o vedenie în care a fost chemat de un om care zicea: „Vino în Macedonia şi ajută-ne!“ Că acel om din viziunea lui Pavel nu era altul decât Luca. Pentru că primul pe care Pavel l-a întâlnit cu adevărat când a venit în Macedonia a fost Luca. Și așa cum suntem în cartea Faptele Apostolilor, veți găsi că atunci când ajungem la acea porțiune a cărții Faptele Apostolilor, Luca începe să scrie mai mult la persoana întâi decât la persoana a treia. Aşadar, este evident că în acest punct special din Faptele Apostolilor Luca a devenit un tovarăş de drum al lui Pavel şi a început să meargă cu el; a început să folosească pronumele „noi” şi „noi” în loc de „ei” şi „ei”. Acesta este, fără îndoială, locul în care Luke a devenit un participant și un martor ocular al acelor lucruri care se întâmplau de la acest punct încoace. Vom aduce acest lucru la tine atunci când vom ajunge la acel punct.<br/>El începe Faptele Apostolilor prin legarea ei cu Evanghelia după Luca. Este interesant faptul că ultimul lucru pe care Luca îl consemnează în Evanghelia sa este primul lucru pe care îl consemnează în Faptele Apostolilor. Găsim Evanghelia lui Luca încheiată în timp ce Isus îi spune discipolilor săi să aștepte în Ierusalim până când vor fi îmbrăcați cu putere de sus. Și apoi Isus s-a înălțat la cer, și astfel el închide Evanghelia. Deschizând Faptele Apostolilor, el scrie,<br/>Ţi-am scris, Teofil, cartea cea dintâi, despre tot ce a început Isus să facă şi să înveţe (Faptele Apostolilor 1:1).<br/>Cuvântul cheie a început. Evanghelia după Luca nu este povestea completă a slujirii lui Isus Hristos. Este doar începutul slujirii lui Isus Hristos. Isus continuă să slujească la nevoile oamenilor. Isus continuă să vindece bolnavii. Isus continuă să învie morţii. Isus continuă să-Şi slujească dragostea şi Evanghelia lumii, numai acum El slujeşte prin acei ucenici care au fost unşi cu Duhul Său Sfânt. Dar slujirea lui Hristos continuă; în esență, este premisa pe care Luca o ia în Faptele Apostolilor. Primul tratat a tot ceea ce a început Isus, atât să facă, cât și să învețe.<br/>Pentru aceasta, Faptele Apostolilor este o carte neterminată: în aceea că Domnul continuă astăzi să lucreze prin viețile celor care s-au dedicat să fie instrumentele lui Dumnezeu. Să fim călăuziți, călăuziți și unși de Duhul Său Sfânt, să continuăm lucrarea lui Isus în lumea de astăzi. Acum Dumnezeu a rânduit ca lucrarea Sa să fie îndeplinită prin instrumente umane. Nu spun că trebuie să fie îndeplinită. Dumnezeu poate folosi ființe îngerești pentru lucrarea Sa, și va veni un timp, în timpul cărții Apocalipsei, când Dumnezeu va folosi îngerii pentru a proclama Evanghelia Sa oamenilor din întreaga lume. Apocalipsa, capitolul 14, "Primul înger care zboară prin mijlocul cerului având Evanghelia veşnică" (Apoc. 14:6). Dar în prezent, Dumnezeu a ales să folosească instrumente umane. Oricât de imperfecte ar fi ele, totuşi aceasta este ceea ce Dumnezeu a rânduit să folosească. Lucrul interesant este că Dumnezeu mă va folosi pe mine și Dumnezeu te va folosi pe tine. De atâtea ori, ne rugăm, "Doamne, nu pot vorbi. Nu am fost niciodată în stare să vorbesc înainte sau chiar acum, Doamne." În timp ce Moise încerca să cerșească chemarea lui Dumnezeu. Ieremia a spus: „Doamne, sunt doar un copil; nimeni nu mă va asculta.” Şi cu toţii avem scuzele noastre de ce nu putem fi folosiţi. Nu-i aşa? Cu toţii ştim motivele pentru care Dumnezeu nu ne poate folosi.<br/>Odată, în timp ce Domnul chema un profet să-Şi facă lucrarea, El a zis: „Doamne, trimite pe cine vrei.” Domnul a zis: „Hei, te-am chemat.” „Doamne, este o idee bună; trimite pe cine vrei.” Atât de des ne aflăm în această poziţie: „Doamne, trimite pe cine vrei tu, pe oricine în afară de mine, Doamne.” Şi totuşi, Dumnezeu a rânduit să ne folosească.<br/>Acum, fiecare dintre noi poate arăta propriile imperfecțiuni. Fiecare dintre noi poate arăta propriile neputințe, și toți putem găsi o scuză de ce Dumnezeu nu ar vrea să mă folosească. Dar totuși, Dumnezeu a ales să te folosească. Te întrebi când Dumnezeu are astfel de instrumente pentru a folosi modul în care El a făcut vreodată treaba, nu-i aşa?<br/>Până în ziua în care a fost ridicat, după ce, prin Duhul Sfânt, a dat porunci apostolilor pe care i-a ales (Faptele Apostolilor 1:2):<br/>Acesta este motivul pentru care a încheiat Evanghelia după Luca: ziua în care Isus a fost ridicat, după ce le-a spus apostolilor să aştepte înzestrarea cu putere.<br/>Căruia i s-a arătat viu, după pătimirea lui, prin multe dovezi infailibile,<br/>Este greu de negat faptul învierii lui Isus Hristos. Am fost amuzat, precum și supărat și iritat, de un articol pe care l-am citit în Registrul Santa Ana în această sâmbătă trecută. Despre știința creației și teoriile evoluționiste care sunt prezentate în școlile județene. Cum adică, acest profesor a spus că predă o clasă de științe, și astfel, se ocupă doar de fapte, și că nu au loc pentru teorii. Pentru că știința se bazează pe fapte și creația se bazează pe superstiții religioase. Este nevoie de multă credință pentru a crede teoriile religioase. Când ai de-a face cu fapte, le poți accepta pur și simplu. M-am gândit, "Foarte interesant în acea clasă de științe, m-au învățat că era un fapt că lumea avea patru miliarde de ani. Acum învață că este un fapt că lumea are 12 miliarde de ani. Și nu cu mult timp în urmă am mers la școală.”<br/>Este interesant faptul că Biblia nu a trebuit niciodată să fie revizuită sau actualizată pentru a satisface datele actuale pe care oamenii le-au descoperit. Și totuși, dacă ați lua manualele mele de știință de liceu astăzi și ați încerca să predați o clasă de știință de la ele, ați descoperi că multe dintre lucrurile care au fost predate ca fapt științific când eram în liceu nu mai sunt recunoscute ca fapt științific. Protoplasma celulară simplă nu mai este o celulă simplă, ci extrem de complexă. Dacă există vreun fapt care poate fi atestat în istorie este faptul învierii lui Isus Cristos din morți.<br/>Avem un sistem de jurisprudenţă bazat pe mărturia martorilor. Dacă un om este acuzat de o crimă și există oameni care au fost martori la acea crimă în timp ce a fost săvârșită, și ei sunt aduși la standard, și ei jură să spună adevărul, întregul adevăr, și nimic altceva decât adevărul, așa că ajută-i pe ei Dumnezeu. Şi în interogatoriul lor ei afirmă că: „L-am văzut pe omul acela în bancă în ziua de douăzeci şi trei de mai. L-am văzut scoţând o armă din haină. L-am auzit cerând ca toţi banii să-i fie daţi. L-am văzut părăsind banca. L-am văzut când ofiţerul l-a arestat afară. Şi dacă poţi să aduci trei sau patru martori să arate acel om şi să le păstrezi mărturia sub interogatoriu, acel om va fi găsit vinovat. El este cel care a făcut-o. Avem doi sau trei martori care depun mărturie despre aceeaşi poveste despre acel om, şi este acceptat ca fapt că el este cel care a comis crima şi este vinovat.<br/>După moartea lui Isus, când a înviat din nou, S-a arătat multor oameni diferiţi, care au mărturisit cu jurământ că L-au văzut, că au vorbit cu El, că Le-a apărut în diferite locuri, în diferite împrejurări. Și pentru o perioadă de patruzeci de zile a fost în vizită cu ei. Și la un moment dat, până la până la cinci sute de oameni care s-au adunat într-un singur loc, El a apărut. Este dificil să doar aruncați deoparte sau să negați mărturia acestor oameni. A face acest lucru înseamnă a discredita întregul nostru sistem de jurisprudență. Dar nu numai că, acești oameni care au mărturisit că l-au văzut pe Domnul înviat, că au vorbit cu El, că au mâncat cu El, ei, toți, cu excepția unuia, au întâmpinat morți violente de la alți oameni pentru că au afirmat că povestea pe care au spus-o era adevărată. Vorbeşti despre martori care au jurat să spună adevărul, tot adevărul, nimic altceva decât adevărul. Dacă viaţa unei persoane ar fi fost ameninţată din cauza acelui martor, şi a fost o minciună, cel puţin unul dintre ei ar fi rupt sub presiune. Ei ar fi mărturisit întreaga farsă. "El S-a arătat viu după pătimirea Sa prin multe dovezi infailibile."<br/>El le-a fost arătat timp de patruzeci de zile şi le-a vorbit despre lucrurile privitoare la Împărăţia lui Dumnezeu (Faptele Apostolilor 1:3).<br/>Uneori îi condamnăm pe discipoli din cauza întrebărilor lor cu privire la calendarul împărăției lui Dumnezeu. Să ne amintim că împărăția lui Dumnezeu a fost subiectul preferat al lui Isus Cristos. El a vorbit întotdeauna despre Împărăția lui Dumnezeu și este o mare speranță că El a sădit în inimile tuturor oamenilor. Lucrurile nu vor continua întotdeauna să fie corupte așa cum sunt. Lumea nu va merge pentru totdeauna sub puterea întunericului, sub robia răului. Dumnezeu va stabili într-o zi Împărăția Sa pe pământ. O împărăție a bucuriei drepte și a păcii. "Isus va domni acolo unde soarele se va întinde şi Împărăţia Lui se va întinde de la ţărm la ţărm." Și acea zi va fi cea mai glorioasă zi pe care lumea a văzut-o vreodată, când boala, suferința și durerea vor fi abolite în Împărăția Sa, când păcatul și lăcomia și aceste lucruri care au făcut lumea un loc atât de intolerabil vor fi abolite în Împărăția Sa. Comercialismul fără Dumnezeu, exploatarea omului, toate aceste lucruri au fost desființate în împărăția Lui glorioasă când El domnește. Nu este de mirare că ucenicii au fost nerăbdători să-l ia. Sunt nerăbdător să-l ia; Sunt nerăbdător pentru împărăția Lui să vină. Și Isus ne-a spus atunci când ne rugăm, prima cerere este: "Vie împărăția Ta. Să se facă voia Ta pe pământ, așa cum este în ceruri" ( Mat 6:10 ). Acesta este genul corect de dorință pe care ar trebui să o avem toți. Doresc împărăția lui Dumnezeu. Şi astfel El le vorbea, în timpul acestei perioade de patruzeci de zile, despre împărăţie.<br/>Și adunându-se împreună cu ei, le-a poruncit să nu se depărteze de Ierusalim, ci să aștepte făgăduința Tatălui, pe care ați auzit-o de la Mine (Faptele Apostolilor 1:4).<br/>El a zis: „Iată, rămâi aici, în Ierusalim, pînă vei primi făgăduinţa Tatălui.” Această promisiune la care se referă El este, fără îndoială, promisiunea din Ioel în care Domnul a promis: „Și se va întâmpla în zilele de pe urmă, zice Domnul, că voi turna Duhul Meu peste orice făptură; și fiii și fiicele voastre vor prooroci, și tinerii voștri vor visa vise, bătrânii voștri vor vedea vedenii. Făgăduinţa Tatălui: va veni ziua când Dumnezeu va revărsa Duhul Său peste tot trupul, peste toţi credincioşii. Ei vor primi fiecare această dinamică de la Dumnezeu.<br/>Căci Ioan a botezat cu adevărat cu apă, dar voi veţi fi botezaţi cu Duhul Sfânt, nu peste mult timp (Faptele Apostolilor 1, 5).<br/>Ioan a botezat cu apă, a scufundat poporul în apă, „veţi fi scufundaţi în Duhul Sfânt în nu multe zile.”<br/>Şi când s-au adunat, L-au întrebat, zicând: Doamne, în vremea aceasta vei restabili Împărăţia lui Israel?<br/>„Când va fi, Doamne? Când va fi timpul pentru această restaurare?” Şi Isus le vorbeşte acum, nu despre Împărăţie, ci despre puterea pe care ei o vor primi pentru slujire. Şi astfel El pune deoparte întrebarea lor.<br/>El le-a zis: „Voi nu trebuie să cunoaşteţi vremurile sau anotimpurile pe care Tatăl le-a pus în puterea Sa” (Faptele Apostolilor 1:7).<br/>"Nu este pentru tine să știi." Ei au trăit în mod constant în anticiparea înființării imediate a împărăției. În timpul întregii vieți a lui Isus, ei L-au așteptat în orice moment să intre în cabina telefonică și să iasă ca salvator al lumii. Shazzam! Arătându-Şi puterea şi răsturnând guvernele lumii, stabilind împărăţia lui Dumnezeu pe pământ. Şi ei aşteptau în fiecare zi ca această schimbare să se întâmple. Și ori de câte ori Isus vorbea despre a merge la Ierusalim, fiind predat în mâinile unui om păcătos, și apoi fiind răstignit, "O, o, nu, Doamne. Nu, nu înțelegi împărăția, Doamne. Fii atât de departe de Tine." Când Isus a murit pe cruce, toţi au fost foarte dezamăgiţi.<br/>Cei doi ucenici în drum spre Emaus, atât de trist. "Hei, băieți. Cum de sunteți atât de trist ca mersul pe jos de-a lungul?" "Ce vrei să spui? Trebuie să fie un străin pe aici, dacă nu știți lucrurile care s-au întâmplat în ultimul timp în Ierusalim." "Ce lucruri?" „O, un om pe nume Isus din Nazaret...o, omule, era puternic şi puternic. Ungerea lui Dumnezeu era asupra vieţii Lui. Noi speram că în El era eliberarea lui Israel, dar ei L-au răstignit. Noi speram... acum este mort.” Acum El a înviat şi spune: „În câteva zile, oameni buni, veţi primi făgăduinţa Tatălui.” „O, ce făgăduinţă? Promisiunea stabilirii împărăţiei?” Vedeţi, era legitim ca ei să întrebe. „Este acesta Domnul? Bine! Este acesta timpul? Îţi vei întemeia Împărăţia acum?“ „Nu. Nu este pentru voi să cunoaşteţi acele vremuri pe care Tatăl le-a rânduit sau pe care Tatăl le are în propria Lui putere; ci veţi primi putere când Duhul Sfânt va veni peste voi.“<br/>Acum aici, prepoziţia greacă epi este folosită pentru a semnifica o nouă relaţie pe care trebuiau să o aibă cu Duhul Sfânt. În Evanghelia după Ioan, capitolul 14, în timp ce Isus promitea să trimită Duhul Sfânt, El a spus: „Nu vă voi lăsa fără mângâiere. Eu voi veni la voi, şi Mă voi ruga Tatălui, şi El vă va trimite un alt Mângâietor, Duhul Adevărului, pe care lumea nu-L poate primi, pentru că nu-L vede şi nu-L cunoaşte, ci voi Îl cunoaşteţi, pentru că El locuieşte cu voi şi va fi în voi” (Ioan 14:17-18). Aceeași prepoziție greacă ca a noastră, numai că ei o scriu "en" în loc de "in". Relație dublă acolo în Ioan: El este cu voi, dar El va locui în voi. Dar acum Isus a spus că veți primi putere când Duhul Sfânt va veni peste voi. Prepoziția greacă epi, care este tradusă în diferite texte de-a lungul Noului Testament ca "pe" sau "deasupra" sau "îmi place", "se revarsă".<br/>În capitolul al şaptelea al Evangheliei după Ioan: „În ziua de pe urmă, în ziua cea mare a praznicului, când Isus stătea acolo pe muntele Templului şi striga către popor: „Dacă-i este sete, să vină la Mine şi să bea; şi cel ce bea din apa pe care o dau Eu, din adâncul sufletului său va ţâşni râuri de apă vie.” Ioan a spus: „Aceasta a spus despre Duhul, care nu a fost încă dat, ceea ce cei care cred în El ar trebui să primească” (Ioan 7:37-39). Ce a spus despre Duhul? Că va fi ca un râu de apă vie care curge. Îmi place, "Când Duhul te copleşeşte", peste tine, sau peste tine, sau se copleşeşte de la tine. Deci, tripla relație: El este cu tine înainte de convertirea ta, El este cel care te face să-ți dai seama că ești un păcătos, El este cel care îl arată pe Isus Cristos ca răspuns în timp ce convinge lumea de păcat, de dreptate și de judecată. În momentul în care îți deschizi viața și inima lui Isus Hristos și Îl inviți să intre, Duhul Sfânt vine și începe să locuiască în tine. El va fi în tine. Nu ştiţi că nu sunteţi ai voştri, ci că aţi fost cumpăraţi cu un preţ; de aceea, slăviţi pe Dumnezeu în trupul vostru şi în duhul vostru, care este al Lui; şi nu ştiţi că trupul vostru este templul Duhului Sfânt, care este în voi? Nu fiţi beţi de vin, în care este exces, ci fiţi umpluţi sau fiţi umpluţi de Duhul" (1 Corinteni 6:19-20, Efeseni 5:18). Dar acum iată o a treia relaţie. Aceasta este o experienţă care dă putere.<br/>Veţi primi dinamismul, când Duhul Sfânt va veni peste voi; şi îmi veţi fi martori.(Faptele Apostolilor 1:8)<br/>Și astfel dinamica, de a fi un martor pentru Isus Cristos. Este interesant faptul că cuvântul martor în limba greacă este cuvântul martus de unde obținem cuvântul nostru martir. Și în limba greacă înseamnă martir. Un martor este cel care nu numai că proclamă ceea ce crede, el trăieşte ceea ce crede, el este ceea ce crede, şi el crede atât de puternic, că, dacă este necesar, va muri pentru ceea ce crede. Asta este cât de puternică este credinţa lui. El este un martus. Nu-i este frică să moară pentru ceea ce crede.<br/>Vă amintiţi când Pavel se întorcea la Ierusalim şi Agab a coborât din Cezareea şi a luat centura lui Pavel şi s-a legat şi a zis: „Aşa este omul care deţine centura aceasta, ca să fie legat când va ajunge la Ierusalim.” Și prietenii lui Pavel au început să plângă, spunând: "Oh, Paul, nu pleca, nu pleca." Și el a spus: "Ce vrei să spui cu aceste lacrimi? Crezi că ai de gând să mă descurajeze? Crezi că sunt îngrijorat de a fi legat? Sunt gata să mor." El a fost un martus. "Eu sunt gata să mor." Fiind omorât pentru credinţa ta nu te-a făcut un martir; pentru că ai fost un martir, ai fost omorât. Pentru că ai fost un martor, pentru că ai crezut atât de puternic. Deci, nu te-a făcut martor, ci doar a dovedit ceea ce erai. Ai fost martor tot timpul. Dacă nu ai fi fost un martus, nu te-ai fi dus niciodată la moarte. Te-ai fi retras; ai fi spus, "Whoa, whoa, stai, stai. Stai puţin, să schimbăm cursul aici. Cred că am făcut o greşeală." Apoi spui, "Ei bine, el nu a fost un martus. Furtul unui cal nu te face un hoţ de cai; doar dovedeşte că ai fost. Nimeni nu fură un cal decât dacă este un hoţ de cai. Deci, furtul nu te face un hoț de cai, ci doar dovedește că ai fost tot timpul. Fiind martirizat dovedește doar ceea ce ai fost un martor, un martus. "Și veți fi martori." Și nu este interesant că cei mai mulți dintre ei au fost martirizați? "Martori pentru Mine".<br/>Martorul trebuia să fie atât în Ierusalim, cât şi în toată Iudeea (Faptele Apostolilor 1:8).<br/>Martorul a început chiar de acasă. Cel mai greu loc, nu-i așa? Este de a începe chiar de acasă în Ierusalim, și apoi zona din jurul Ierusalimului, zona Iudeii. Și apoi a fost să se răspândească în Samaria. Și apoi a fost să mergem în cele mai îndepărtate părți ale lumii. Și pe măsură ce studiem cartea Faptele Apostolilor, vom vedea acest progres. Cum a început mărturia în Ierusalim. Vom afla asta în capitolul următor. Și apoi vom vedea cum a început să se răspândească în toată Iudeea. Și apoi Filip a urcat în Samaria, și apoi în cele din urmă Pavel și Barnaba sunt chemați să meargă în cele mai îndepărtate părți ale lumii. Și astfel mărturia s-a răspândit prin ungerea și împuternicirea Duhului Sfânt.<br/>După ce a spus aceste lucruri, pe când se uitau ei, a fost ridicat şi un nor l-a luat dinaintea lor (Faptele Apostolilor 1:9).<br/>Aceasta este ultima promisiune făcută de Isus discipolilor Săi. Aceasta este, ultimele cuvinte înainte de înălțarea Sa. Desigur, mai târziu El a venit și a vorbit cu Pavel și cu alții, dar înainte de înălțarea Sa, acesta este ultimul cuvânt al Său. După ce a spus aceste lucruri, în timp ce ei Îl priveau, S-a ridicat şi un nor L-a primit dinaintea lor.<br/>Și pe când priveau spre cer, în timp ce El Se înălța, iată că stăteau lângă ei doi bărbați îmbrăcați în haine albe (Faptele Apostolilor 1:10).<br/>Presupunem că erau îngeri.<br/>Care a mai zis: „Bărbaţi galileeni, de ce staţi cu ochii în sus spre cer? Acest Isus, care a fost înălţat de la voi la cer, va veni aşa cum l-aţi văzut mergând la cer” (Faptele Apostolilor 1:11).<br/>Ei L-au văzut în timp ce Se înălţa la cer şi Îl vor vedea când va veni din nou. „Iată, Domnul vine cu zeci de mii de sfinţi ai Săi, ca să judece pe pământ” (Iuda 1:14-15). Și apoi: „A Celui ce ne-a iubit și S-a dat pe Sine pentru noi și ne-a făcut Dumnezeului nostru, regi și preoți care vor împărăți cu El pe pământ, iată că vine Domnul și orice ochi Îl va vedea și chiar și cei care L-au străpuns se vor întrista” (Apocalipsa 1:5-7). Deci Domnul vine. Fiecare ochi Îl va vedea. Martorii lui Iehova spun că El a venit deja, dar a fost o venire secretă. Deoarece numai ucenicii L-au văzut plecând, numai ucenicii, Martorii lui Iehova, L-au văzut revenind. Dar Isus a zis: „Dacă vă vor zice: ‘A venit în ascuns şi a intrat într-o odaie ascunsă, să nu credeţi.’” (Matei 24:26). Aşadar, trebuie să alegeţi, să credeţi în Isus sau în ei.<br/>„Acest Isus care a fost înălţat de la voi la cer, va veni aşa cum L-aţi văzut mergând la cer.”<br/>Acum, există un verset foarte interesant în 2 Ioan, versetul Fapte 1:7, "Căci mulți înșelători au intrat în lume care nu mărturisesc că Isus Cristos a venit în trup." Asta, din păcate, este o traducere slabă a greacă. Căci acest participiu este în prezent și ar trebui să fie tradus "vine în trup." Cei care ar tăgădui că Isus Cristos vine în trup. Ce spune Ioan despre ei? "Ei sunt un înșelător și un antihrist. Luaţi seama la voi înşivă, ca nu cumva să pierdem ceea ce am făcut, ci să primim o răsplată deplină. Căci oricine se leapădă de învăţătura lui Hristos şi nu rămâne în ea, n-are pe Dumnezeu. Cine rămâne în învăţătura lui Hristos, are şi pe Tatăl şi pe Fiul. Dacă vine cineva la uşa voastră şi nu aduce învăţătura aceasta, să nu-l primiţi în casa voastră şi să nu-i spuneţi la revedere. Căci cel ce-şi ia rămas bun este părtaş la faptele lui rele" (2Ioan 1:7-11). Pune-le o singură întrebare: "Isus vine în trup?" Doar pune-le această întrebare. Şi dacă ei spun nu, amintiţi-vă ce v-a spus Ioan şi ce v-a spus Ioan. "Dacă cineva nu mărturiseşte că Isus Hristos vine în trup." Îţi aminteşti când a fost cu ucenicii şi a zis: "Dă-mi ceva de mâncare?" El a spus: "Ştii, duhurile nu mănâncă; atinge-mă. Vezi? Sunt eu." Deci, acelaşi Isus vine din nou în acelaşi mod în care L-au văzut mergând în cer. Şi eu, pentru unul, cred că acea venire este foarte curând.<br/>Apoi s-au întors la Ierusalim de pe muntele numit al Măslinilor, care este de la Ierusalim o călătorie de o zi de Sabat. Au intrat în odaia de sus, unde locuiau Petru, Iacov, Ioan, Andrei, Filip, Toma, Bartolomeu, Matei, Iacov, fiul lui Alfeu, Simon Zelotul, şi Iuda, fratele lui Iacov. Şi toţi aceştia au rămas împreună în rugăciune şi în rugăciune, împreună cu femeile şi cu Maria, mama lui Isus, şi cu fraţii Lui (Faptele Apostolilor 1:12-14).<br/>Aceasta este ultima mențiune a Mariei, mama lui Isus. În acest moment și de acum înainte, nu mai există nicio mențiune despre ea în Faptele Apostolilor sau în epistole. Nici o mențiune despre moartea ei sau despre înălțarea ei miraculoasă la cer, fără moarte. Nu se menţionează nimic în Scriptură. Este tăcut.<br/>Fraţii săi vor fi probabil o referinţă la Iacov şi la Iuda şi la acei alţi fraţi care erau fii ai lui Iosif şi ai Mariei.<br/>Camera de sus – sunt unii care spun că este aceeaşi cameră de sus în care Isus a avut Cina cea de Taină cu ucenicii Săi. Şi totuşi, sunt alţii care susţin că această cameră de sus este o cameră în incinta templului unde s-a întâlnit biserica timpurie. Ia decizia ta.<br/>În zilele acelea, Petru s-a sculat în mijlocul ucenicilor şi a zis: „Fraţilor, trebuie să se fi împlinit Scriptura aceasta, pe care a vorbit mai înainte Duhul Sfânt prin gura lui David despre Iuda, care era călăuza celor ce L-au luat pe Isus” (Faptele Apostolilor 1:15-16).<br/>Aici, din nou, Petru este încă același sine impetuos. Ei așteaptă în rugăciune și implorare, iar Petru se ridică și spune, "Fraților, există o scriptură care trebuie să se împlinească." Și știți că el va merge mai departe, "Să începem programul, să tragem la sorți și să aflăm cine va lua locul lui Iuda." Simt că Petru era din nou în trup, manifestând acea natură impetuoasă care era a lui. Și cred că istoria viitoare a bisericii din cartea Faptele Apostolilor arată acest lucru. Sunt interesat de înțelegerea lui Petru a Scripturilor, cum el citează din atât de multe locuri din Vechiul Testament. Petru manifestă o foarte mare înțelegere a Scripturilor Vechiului Testament, care este un punct în favoarea lui.<br/>Observați că Petru atribuie Duhului Sfânt acele lucruri pe care le-a scris David. Astfel, "Toată Scriptura este dată prin inspirație de la Dumnezeu" (2 Timotei 3:16). Nu face parte din Scripturi. Pentru că, dacă îmi spui că o parte din Scripturi sunt date prin inspirație de la Dumnezeu, atunci trebuie să te întreb: „Ce părți sunt prin inspirație și ce părți nu sunt prin inspirație?” Şi apoi tu eşti autoritatea care-mi spune ce parte pot să cred şi ce parte nu pot să cred. Şi în clipa în care Dumnezeu nu mai este autoritatea, ci tu eşti autoritatea, eu sunt în necaz. Feriţi-vă de aceia care spun: “Nu puteţi crede toate Scripturile!” Scripturile însăşi spun: “Toată Scriptura este dată prin inspiraţie de la Dumnezeu.” Şi aici, Luca, scriind despre ceea ce spunea Petru, declară că David era de fapt purtătorul de cuvânt al Duhului Sfânt. Duhul Sfânt, prin gura lui David, a vorbit despre Iuda.<br/>Căci el a fost numărat cu noi, [era unul dintre cei doisprezece] el a primit o parte din această slujbă. Dar acum omul acesta a cumpărat un ogor cu răsplata nelegiuirii, și a căzut cu capul înainte (Fapte 1:17-18 ),<br/>El a cumpărat ogorul, ogorul olarului, aşa cum spune Zaharia capitolul al unsprezecelea.<br/>şi a căzut cu capul în jos, s-a rupt în două, şi i s-au vărsat toate măruntaiele (Faptele Apostolilor 1:18).<br/>Sunt unii care găsesc o discrepanță în Scripturi, pentru că într-una din Evanghelii ni se spune că atunci când Iuda s-a întors și a încercat să returneze banii, și au spus: „Hei, este problema ta. Nu putem să o acceptăm.” Și să o punem înapoi în vistieria templului. "Este bani de sânge." Apoi l-a aruncat acolo pe podeaua templului și a ieșit și s-a spânzurat. Aici Petru ne spune că a căzut cu capul în jos și tocmai a sărit. Și există cei care își imaginează o discrepanță. Foarte simplu, el a urcat în copac pentru a se spânzura, a legat frânghia în jurul gâtului și a legat-o de membru și a sărit. Și forța căderii fie a rupt frânghia sau capul, și a căzut în jos în canion și exact așa cum a spus aici.<br/>Toţi locuitorii Ierusalimului au cunoscut lucrul acesta, aşa că ogorul se cheamă în limba lor Aceldama, adică, ogorul sângelui. Căci este scris în cartea Psalmilor:,,Locuinţa lui să fie pustiită, şi nimeni să nu locuiască în ea; şi episcopatul lui să ia pe altul“ (Faptele Apostolilor 1:19-20).<br/>Acum, în realitate el citează din doi psalmi diferiți aici. Din Psalmul 69:25 , el pune împreună cu Psalmul 109:8 . Și punând împreună cele două el găsește aceste profeții despre Iuda.<br/>Prin urmare, dintre acești oameni ( Faptele Apostolilor 1:21 )<br/>Iată unde caută pe cineva care să-i ia locul lui Iuda ca apostol. Iată calificările pe care le căutau în acel timp.<br/>De aceea, dintre oamenii aceştia, care au fost împreună cu noi în tot timpul când Domnul Isus a intrat şi a ieşit printre noi (Faptele Apostolilor 1:21),<br/>Acum vă amintiți că au fost mulți ucenici, mulți dintre care Isus a ales zece discipoli să fie apostoli. Și cuvântul apostol înseamnă "cel care este trimis." Sau a ales doisprezece să fie apostoli, așa că a trimis pe cei doisprezece. Numărul de guvernare umană. "Avem doar unsprezece. Avem nevoie de unul care să ia locul lui Iuda, dar avem nevoie de unul care a fost cu noi tot timpul de la început cu Isus."<br/>Din momentul în care a fost botezat de Ioan, până în ziua în care a fost luat de la noi, trebuie să fie rânduit cineva să fie martor [al ceea ce?] învierii Sale (Faptele Apostolilor 1:22 ).<br/>Deci acestea au fost cerințele pe care le căutau. Cineva care a fost în jurul întregului timp. Din momentul botezului lui Ioan până la înălțare. Și unul care l-a văzut pe Domnul înviat, și astfel a putut să suporte fapta învierii, mărturia lor despre acest fapt.<br/>Acum apostolul Pavel, mai târziu în afirmarea faptului că el a fost un apostol a spus: "Nu L-am văzut pe Hristos înviat?" Evident că aceasta a fost una dintre cerințele apostolatului. Cineva m-a întrebat, "Sunt apostoli astăzi?" Ei bine, nu știu. Nu cred că există în acelaşi sens în care au fost în Noul Testament. Cu siguranţă nu există nimeni astăzi care poate să dea mărturie despre înviere ca ei au făcut.<br/>Au pus pe doi, pe Iosif, numit Barsabas, care se chema Iustus, şi pe Matia; şi s-au rugat şi au zis: „Doamne, Tu care cunoşti inimile tuturor oamenilor, arată-ne dacă dintre aceştia doi ai ales-o pe cea pe care ai ales-o Tu” (Faptele Apostolilor 1:23-24).<br/>Cred că adesea facem această greșeală de a-i da Domnului două alegeri, ambele greșite. Limitarea lui Dumnezeu, vezi tu. Suntem atât de predispuși să facem acest lucru. Evident, Pavel a fost alegerea lui Dumnezeu. Petru a fost impetuos, şi a sărit pistolul a spus, "Hei, trebuie să facem ceva, să-l ajutăm pe Dumnezeu. Ştii, unul lipseşte şi trebuie să-l umplem." Şi totuşi, "Dumnezeule, pe care dintre cei doi îl vrei?" Şi dându-i lui Dumnezeu cele două alegeri.<br/>Ca să ia parte la această slujire şi la această apostolatură, din care a căzut Iuda prin încălcarea legii, ca să se ducă la locul său. Şi astfel şi-au dat sorţii (Fapte 1:25-26 );<br/>O modalitate interesantă prin care au căutat să determine voia lui Dumnezeu. Să aruncăm zarurile, să aflăm care este voia lui Dumnezeu aici. Este interesant pentru mine, diferitele moduri pe care oamenii le-au conceput pentru a discerne voia lui Dumnezeu. Acum, în vremurile Vechiului Testament, ei aveau o cale interesantă de a veni la preot, care s-ar întreba pe Domnul pentru ei prin Urim şi Tumim, „lucrurile şi perfecţiunile”. Exact ce erau aceşti Urim şi Tumim, nu ştim. Sunt sigur că nu erau ochelarii colorati pe care Joseph Smith i-a găsit cu Tabletele de Aur; ochelarii magici, care, atunci când le puneai pe ele, puteai citi dintr-o dată scrierea hieroglifică.<br/>Unii spun că Urimul și Tumimul erau de fapt o piatră albă și neagră purtată într-o pungă pe pieptul preotului. Ei se rugau și îi puneau Domnului o anumită întrebare. Îţi aduci aminte că David întreba pe Domnul: „Doamne, să ieşim împotriva Filistenilor?” Răspunsul a fost: „Nu.” A doua zi iarăşi: „Doamne, să ieşim împotriva Filistenilor?” Răspunsul a fost: „Da.” Ei puneau întrebări specifice, iar Domnul îi călăuzea prin Urim și Thummin. Ei spuneau că preotul se ruga, Îl căuta pe Dumnezeu, apoi ajungea înăuntru și scotea una dintre cele două pietre. Dacă era piatra albă, era un răspuns afirmativ. Dacă ar fi fost un nu, atunci ar fi piatra neagră pe care ar scoate-o. Unii spun chiar că termenul este extras din acest Urim și Thummim. De fapt, în original este un vot împotriva unui anumit proiect sau idee. Nu ştim exact ce erau Urim şi Tumim, dar în perioada Vechiului Testament, ei au folosit o metodă de tragere la sorţi pentru a determina voia lui Dumnezeu.<br/>Deci aici ucenicii adună aceleași lucruri pe măsură ce aruncă zarurile pentru a vedea pe care dintre cei doi pe care Dumnezeu i-a ales să-l înlocuiască pe Iuda Iscarioteanul.<br/>soarta a căzut asupra lui Matias; el a fost numărat cu cei unsprezece (Faptele Apostolilor 1:26).<br/>Acum, cine din lume este Matthias? Nimeni nu a auzit de el înainte sau de atunci. Va fi interesant să ne întâlnim cu Matthias și să aflăm cine este și ce a făcut. Cred că din istoria ulterioară, este evident să presupunem că Dumnezeu l-a ales pe Pavel ca apostol. Aceasta este ultima oară când citim despre ei căutând să deosebească voia lui Dumnezeu prin tragerea la sorţi sau printr-un fel de întâmplare.<br/>Cunosc astăzi un om care, căutând să deosebească voia Domnului, se va ruga şi îi va pune Domnului o întrebare. El va avea zece bănuţi în buzunar, şi în timp ce se roagă, el va lua bănuţii cu ochii închişi şi îi va pune pe masă, şi dacă toţi vor veni cu capetele sus, va fi un da. Un lucru interesant, din când în când, ei vor veni cu toții la cap, și asta este destul de probabil. Cu toate acestea, nu găsim nici un model pentru acest lucru după ce Duhul Sfânt a fost dat. După ce Duhul Sfânt S-a coborât peste biserică, Duhul Sfânt a început să le vorbească şi să-i călăuzească. Şi Duhul Sfânt a zis: „Despărţiţi-Mi pe Pavel şi pe Barnaba pentru slujba la care i-am chemat” (Fapte 13:2). Și Duhul Sfânt i-a trimis. Așa că găsim biserica mai direct călăuzită de Duhul Sfânt. Odată ce Duhul Sfânt a venit, această aruncare de zaruri pentru a afla voia lui Dumnezeu a fost pusă deoparte.<br/>"<br/><br/>Versiunea King James<br/><br/>Aceasta este versiunea King James din 1769 a Sfintei Scripturi (cunoscută și ca versiunea autorizată).

Yes that is correct, the Urbanears don't have a built in noise cancelling mic on the headphone itself but from what I can see there is a mic on the cable provided.<br/>1. Well the mic is usually placed where it can have a connection to the PCB which are within the headphones so if you mean that the mic shouldn't be on the headphone itself, that (from my experience) is incorrect.<br/>2.

In fact, dynamic drivers work exactly the same as dynamic microphones but in reverse. Inside a dynamic driver there is a magnet, and when you plug in the headphones, you are sending a AC current through it which will turn the voice coil into a magnet. Depending on the direction of the current, the polarity of the magnet will change. Now since we know for a magnet, same charges repels and different charges attract, we know that the voice coil will move back and forth depending on it's polarity at the time. The voice coil is attached to the diaphragm which will then move back and forth creating a sound wave. The same occurs in reverse, if you move a coil through a magnet you produce a current instead. Since your voice is pushing the diaphragm, it is moving the voice coil back and forth generating the current you have observed.<br/><br/>100+ Head-Fier<br/><br/>Joined:<br/>Nov 7, 2011<br/><br/>Posts:<br/>134<br/><br/>Likes: 55<br/><br/>Exactly.

De fapt, driverele dinamice funcționează exact la fel ca microfoanele dinamice, dar invers. În interiorul unui driver dinamic există un magnet, iar atunci când conectați căștile, trimiteți un curent alternativ prin el, care va transforma bobina vocală într-un magnet. În funcție de direcția curentului, polaritatea magnetului se va schimba. Acum, din moment ce știm pentru un magnet, aceleași sarcini respinge și diferite sarcini atrag, știm că bobina de voce se va deplasa înainte și înapoi în funcție de polaritatea sa la momentul respectiv. Bobina de voce este atașată la diafragmă, care se va deplasa apoi înainte și înapoi creând o undă sonoră. Același lucru se întâmplă în sens invers, dacă mutați o bobină printr-un magnet, produceți un curent în schimb. Din moment ce vocea ta împinge diafragma, ea deplasează bobina de voce înainte și înapoi, generând curentul pe care l-ai observat.<br/><br/>100+ Cap-Fier<br/><br/>Alăturat:<br/>Septembrie 7, 2011<br/><br/>Postări:<br/>134<br/><br/>Îi place: 55<br/><br/>Exact.

Stalin's opposition within the party, including Bukharin, Yagoda and Rykov were purged in these show trials, as Stalin manipulatively forced them to confess to crimes of planning a coup and opposing the state, even if there was no proof. Gabor T Rittersporn said, "Many of the victims were sincerely devoted to the principles of Bolshevism." This amplifies proof that the Bolshevik ideals that had once been the roots of the Communist Party were being disarranged and destroyed by the Purges. The party was depleted and former members helplessly watched Stalin use the great purge as a tool to transform Russia from a one party state to an unchallenged dictatorship. Again, the purges were shattering the framework of the Communist Party, formed during the Bolshevik revolution. This agrees with the "Stalin the executioner" source as both show the manipulative character, that helped the dictator to enhance his grip on Russia's throat.<br/>The manipulative manner, with which Stalin incriminated his targeted opposition during the purges, in the eyes of everyday Russians, also had an implosive impact on Soviet Society.

Rittersporn a spus: „Multe dintre victime au fost devotate cu sinceritate principiilor bolșevismului”, ceea ce amplifică dovada că idealurile bolșevice care au fost odată rădăcinile Partidului Comunist au fost dezorganizate și distruse de epurări. Partidul a fost epuizat și foștii membri au privit cum Stalin a folosit marea epurare ca instrument pentru a transforma Rusia dintr-un stat de partid într-o dictatură necontestata. Din nou, epurările dărâmau cadrul Partidului Comunist, format în timpul revoluţiei bolşevice. Acest lucru este de acord cu sursa "Stalin călăul", deoarece ambele arată caracterul manipulator, care l-a ajutat pe dictator să-și sporească aderența la gâtul Rusiei.<br/>Manipularea cu care Stalin și-a incriminat opoziția țintită în timpul epurărilor, în ochii rușilor de zi cu zi, a avut, de asemenea, un impact imploziv asupra societății sovietice. Stalin a reușit să obțină sprijinul poporului prin utilizarea propagandei și a mass-mediei pentru a-l ajuta să dezvolte un „cult al personalității” și imaginea unui lider eroic și curajos. Prin acest sprijin Stalin a implantat neîncredere în mintea oamenilor, convingându-i că trădătorii revoluției și ceea ce el a descris ca "dușmani ai poporului" erau printre ei. Acest lucru a aprins în consecință războiul social,...<br/><br/>Cum a fost semnificația pe termen scurt a epurărilor asupra guvernului și societății ruse<br/><br/>1203 cuvinte - 5 pagini<br/>De la al Doilea Război Mondial, Statele Unite au stabilit acorduri cu națiuni din întreaga lume pentru a elimina barierele din calea comerțului internațional și a investițiilor.

| Supercell is nerfing brawlers instead of nerfing star powers. I was at 750 last season with power 8 nita and it is very tough to go past that, like, star powers play a really dominant role. The matchmaking is also trash. When i play gem grab(around 600 trophies), there are often matchups where the enemy team has one more player than us who is maxed and it's not even that we have a lvl 9 to compete versus that. Sometimes there are even matchups where the enemy team is fully maxed and none of us are. this is why i dont play brawl stars seriously anymore. It's not even like there arent many players who are not maxed and around 600 trophies. It's annoying.<br/>Edit: I think supercell should have at least a basic mechanism that takes the average of levels of brawlers when setting up matches.<br/><br/>Except trophies don't really indicate your skill. They indicate the skill of the teammates you are placed with. And I'm fine with playing against higher level brawlers, but when one team is all level 10 and the other team isn't, clearly it's unbalanced.<br/><br/>I reccomend getting some good friends to play with, me and 2 friends got my friends power 1 tick to rank 28 by playing gem grab with a certain composition all day and we made it without a single one of us being maxed with our brawlers.<br/><br/>I Know how you feel I used to have brawlers in high trophies with low level and it's to difficult to go more further and everything I was saying to myself "I want to have star powers" really supercell needs to make balance to the star powers or at least make a better matchmaking system.<br/><br/>I kinda feel this. I ain't as good at the game as you, but I got Emz to 500 at power 1 and the matchmaking was horrible. Maxed out players everywhere! And it didn't help that the majority of my teammates had around 5-8k trophies... I had to resort to solo showdown last minute because I can either ambush unsuspecting players or simply play a little aggressive at the right times. But I really wish that it could be a bit easier for people who want to push brawlers to really high trophy ranges without having the luxury of star powers.<br/><br/>Altho spike is still good without curveball. Curveball was just a help for hitting your shots more often as spike. But even before curveball was released, spike was a really strong brawler, so he will remain the same now.<br/><br/>I agree that they should have nerfed ambush, but I think they are trying to balance both Snappy Sniping and Ambush, as they are both getting merged with this change. She was becoming a little powerful, but still not nerf-worthy<br/><br/>I'm not sure about this, but now that Darryl got a noticeable buff, looking at their new stats, it looks like Darryl might overshadow Bull, as not only he can always deal more damage than Bull, he won't die as early anymore, so their survivability will be similar without star power (although Bull's survivability is still noticeably better than Darryl's if he had Tough Guy). Not only that, Darryl's super can auto regenerate, meaning Darryl MIGHT be able to be played effectively both as a heavyweight AND an assassin at the same time (before he sucks as a heavyweight but decent as an assassin)<br/><br/>But hes overrated af. And you get trophies with him really easily. So im kinda ok with the nerf. I havent even played him since when I got him to 500 (around 5 months ago), so not that I care that much either.<br/><br/>Why doesn't Poco/Penny get a HP nerf, if they are Marksman/Healer respectively not a tank?<br/>Why isn't Rosa's tankyness nerfed, cough 70% damage reduction?<br/>Why is Tick allowed to have the highest range and the most free pokedamage in the entire game?<br/>Why doesn't Leon get a HP/Damage buff?<br/><br/>Be that as it may, it was Ambush that was OP, not base Piper. I would argue that Ambush is the best star power in the game (now even more so since the percentage of damage increase indirectly went up) and base Piper was a bottom-10 brawler.<br/><br/>What Supercell should do is revert both nerfs, reduce Ambush to 600, and reduce Snappy Sniping to 0.25 since it'd be indirectly buffed by the base damage buff.<br/><br/>Yea and I believe they went a bit too far with Rosa, because now she is basically the better bull now when it comes to tanking, which she has been for a while. Now, Darryl might as well be a smaller, more powerful bull<br/><br/>Why? I feel she needs a buff in almost everything except her star power. Her health and speed make her super a bit more difficult to use, because she can die pretty easily, and it is really difficult for her to trap faster brawlers like Crow. Her star power is a bit broken though... | Supercell este nerfing brawlers în loc de nerfing puterile stelelor. Am fost la 750 sezonul trecut cu putere 8 nita și este foarte greu de trecut că, cum ar fi, puterile stele joacă un rol foarte dominant. matchmaking este, de asemenea, gunoi. Când joc prinderea de pietre prețioase (în jur de 600 de trofee), există adesea meciuri în care echipa inamică are un jucător mai mult decât noi, care este maximizat și nici măcar nu avem un lvl 9 pentru a concura împotriva asta. Uneori există chiar meciuri în cazul în care echipa inamică este complet maxed și nici unul dintre noi sunt. acesta este motivul pentru care eu nu joc Brawl stars serios mai. Nu este chiar ca și cum nu există mulți jucători care nu sunt maxed și în jurul valorii de 600 de trofee. Este enervant.<br/>Edit: Cred că supercelulă ar trebui să aibă cel puțin un mecanism de bază care ia media nivelurilor de luptători atunci când setați meciuri.<br/><br/>Cu excepția trofeelor nu indică cu adevărat abilitățile tale. Ele indică abilitățile colegilor de echipă cu care ești plasat. Și sunt bine cu jocul împotriva luptătorilor de nivel superior, dar atunci când o echipă este de nivel 10 și cealaltă echipă nu este, în mod clar este dezechilibrată.<br/><br/>Recomand să-mi fac niște prieteni buni cu care să mă joc, eu și 2 prieteni i-am adus pe prietenii mei la rangul 28 jucând gem grab cu o anumită compoziție toată ziua și am făcut-o fără ca unul dintre noi să fie maximizat cu bătăușii noștri.<br/><br/>Știu cum te simți am folosit pentru a avea brawlers în trofee înalte cu nivel scăzut și este greu să meargă mai departe și tot ceea ce am fost spunându-mi "Vreau să aibă puteri stele" într-adevăr supercelulă trebuie să facă echilibrul cu puterile stelelor sau cel puțin să facă un sistem de potrivire mai bun.<br/><br/>Simt asta. Nu sunt la fel de bun la joc ca tine, dar l-am adus pe Emz la 500 la putere 1 și meciul a fost oribil. Jucători maximizați peste tot! Și nu a ajutat că majoritatea coechipierilor mei au avut în jur de 5-8k trofee... A trebuit să recurg la showdown-ul solo în ultimul moment pentru că pot fie să-i prind pe jucătorii nebănuiti, fie să joc un pic agresiv la momentul potrivit. Dar mi-aş dori să fie un pic mai uşor pentru oamenii care vor să-i împingă pe brawleri la un nivel foarte înalt de trofee fără a avea luxul puterilor stelelor.<br/><br/>Altho spike este încă bun fără curbeball. Curveball a fost doar un ajutor pentru a lovi loviturile mai des ca spike. Dar chiar înainte de curbeball a fost lansat, spike a fost un brawler foarte puternic, așa că va rămâne același acum.<br/><br/>Sunt de acord că ar fi trebuit să fie ambuscadă nervoasă, dar cred că încearcă să echilibreze atât Snappy Sniping și ambuscadă, deoarece ambele sunt fuzionate cu această schimbare. Ea a devenit un pic puternic, dar încă nu nerv demn<br/><br/>Nu sunt sigur de acest lucru, dar acum că Darryl a primit un buff vizibil, uitându-se la noile lor statistici, se pare că Darryl ar putea umbri Bull, deoarece nu numai că el poate face întotdeauna mai multe daune decât Bull, el nu va mai muri cât mai devreme, astfel încât supraviețuirea lor va fi similară fără puterea stelelor (deși supraviețuirea lui Bull este încă vizibil mai bună decât a lui Darryl). Nu numai că, super Darryl se poate regenera automat, ceea ce înseamnă că Darryl poate fi jucat eficient atât ca o greutate grea, cât și ca un asasin în același timp (înainte de a suge ca o greutate grea, dar decent ca un asasin)<br/><br/>Dar el este supraevaluat af. Și veți obține trofee cu el foarte ușor. Deci, am cam bine cu nervul. Nici măcar nu l-am jucat de când l-am ajuns la 500 (aproximativ 5 luni în urmă), deci nu că îmi pasă atât de mult, fie.<br/><br/>De ce nu primește Poco/Penny un nerv HP, dacă sunt Marksman/Healer respectiv nu un rezervor?<br/>De ce nu este tuse tankyness Rosa nervos, reducerea daunelor 70%?<br/>De ce este permis Tick să aibă cea mai mare gamă și cel mai gratuit pokedamage din întregul joc?<br/>De ce nu primeste Leon un HP/Damage buff?<br/><br/>Oricum ar fi, Ambush a fost OP, nu Piper de bază. Aș argumenta că Ambush este cea mai bună putere de stea din joc (acum chiar mai mult, deoarece procentul de creștere a daunelor a crescut indirect) și Piper de bază a fost un luptător de jos-10.<br/><br/>Ce ar trebui să facă Supercell este să inverseze ambii nervi, să reducă ambuscadă la 600, și să reducă Snappy Sniping la 0.25, deoarece ar fi indirect măturat de daunele de bază.<br/><br/>Da și cred că au mers un pic prea departe cu Rosa, pentru că acum ea este practic taurul mai bun acum când vine vorba de rezervor, care a fost pentru o vreme. Acum, Darryl ar putea fi la fel de bine un taur mai mic, mai puternic<br/><br/>De ce? Simt că are nevoie de un buff în aproape totul, cu excepția puterii ei de stea. Sănătatea și viteza ei o fac super un pic mai dificil de utilizat, pentru că poate muri destul de ușor, și este într-adevăr dificil pentru ea să prindă brawlers mai rapid ca Crow. Puterea ei de stea este un pic ruptă, deşi... |

| Self-Employment Part 1<br/><br/>When you accept an employment in any organisation, you have to perform various jobs as per the requirements of your employer and you may get a fixed amount of income as salary. You may run a small retail shop, tailoring shop, restaurant, bakery and confectionery, beauty salon, etc. in your locality. You may get engaged in trading or manufacturing on a small scale or providing some service for a price. Such economic activities are known as self-employment.<br/><br/>Meaning of Self-Employment<br/><br/>Earning is necessary for a living. Our father, mother, brothers, sisters and others may be engaged in different economic activities through which they earn their livelihood. These persons are engaged in an economic activity which is termed as wage employment or paid employment. But there are many persons who engage themselves in an occupation or some business which they start and manage on their own. They put in their best effort and take all types of risks to pursue their careers successfully. The entire earning of their work goes to them. All of us have seen small grocery shops, tailoring shops, medical stores etc. in our locality. These are owned and managed by a person, with or without the help of some assistants. Their economic activities are termed as self-employment. So, when an individual engages in any economic activity and manages it on his own, it is known as self-employment.<br/><br/>Objectives<br/><br/>After studying this lesson, you will be able to:<br/><br/>Image of Objectives<br/><br/>Image of Objectives<br/><br/>Characteristics of Self-Employment<br/><br/>It involves ownership and management of activities by a person although he/she may take the help of one or two persons to assist him/her. Thus, self-employment may provide employment to other persons as well.<br/><br/>The earning from self-employment is not fixed. It depends on the income one can earn by producing or buying and selling goods or providing services to others at a price.<br/><br/>In self-employment, the owner alone has to take the profit and bear the risk of loss. So, we find a direct link between the effort and reward in self-employment.<br/><br/>It requires some amount of capital investment, although it may be small.<br/><br/>In self-employment, a person is free to take decisions in respect of running his business profitably and avail of any opportunity that may come up for expansion of his business. It gives complete freedom to work as per one's own will and within the parameters of the prevailing laws.<br/><br/>Thus, self-employment may be defined as, an economic activity which one may perform on his own as a gainful occupation, and this may consist of producing and selling goods, buying and selling goods, or rendering services for a price. | Ocuparea forței de muncă independentă Partea 1<br/><br/>Atunci când acceptați un loc de muncă în orice organizație, trebuie să efectuați diverse locuri de muncă în conformitate cu cerințele angajatorului dvs. și puteți obține o sumă fixă de venit ca salariu. Puteți conduce un mic magazin de vânzare cu amănuntul, magazin de croitorie, restaurant, brutărie și cofetărie, salon de înfrumusețare, etc. în localitatea dvs. Puteți să vă angajați în comerțul sau fabricarea la scară mică sau să oferiți un serviciu pentru un preț. Astfel de activități economice sunt cunoscute sub numele de muncă independentă.<br/><br/>Înțelesul de auto-angajare<br/><br/>Câștigarea este necesară pentru a trăi. Tatăl nostru, mama, frații, surorile și ceilalți pot fi angajați în diferite activități economice prin care își câștigă traiul. Aceste persoane sunt angajate într-o activitate economică care se numește muncă salariată sau muncă plătită. Dar există multe persoane care se angajează într-o ocupație sau o afacere pe care o încep și o administrează pe cont propriu. Ei depun cele mai bune eforturi și își asumă tot felul de riscuri pentru a-și continua cariera cu succes. Întregul câștig al muncii lor le revine lor. Cu toții am văzut mici magazine alimentare, magazine de croitorie, magazine medicale etc. în localitatea noastră. Acestea sunt deținute și gestionate de o persoană, cu sau fără ajutorul unor asistenți. Activitățile lor economice se numesc muncă independentă. Deci, atunci când un individ se angajează în orice activitate economică și o gestionează pe cont propriu, aceasta este cunoscută sub numele de muncă independentă.<br/><br/>Obiective<br/><br/>După ce ați studiat această lecție, veți putea:<br/><br/>Imaginea obiectivelor<br/><br/>Imaginea obiectivelor<br/><br/>Caracteristicile muncii independente<br/><br/>Aceasta implică deținerea și gestionarea activităților de către o persoană, deși aceasta poate lua ajutorul uneia sau a două persoane pentru a-l asista. Astfel, munca independentă poate oferi locuri de muncă și altor persoane.<br/><br/>Câștigul din munca independentă nu este fixă. Depinde de venitul pe care îl poate câștiga cineva prin producerea sau cumpărarea și vânzarea de bunuri sau furnizarea de servicii altora la un preț.<br/><br/>În munca independentă, doar proprietarul trebuie să ia profitul și să suporte riscul de pierdere. Deci, găsim o legătură directă între efort și recompensă în munca independentă.<br/><br/>Aceasta necesită o anumită sumă de investiții de capital, deși poate fi mică.<br/><br/>În munca independentă, o persoană este liberă să ia decizii cu privire la gestionarea afacerii sale în mod profitabil și să profite de orice oportunitate care poate apărea pentru extinderea afacerii sale. Oferă libertate deplină de a lucra după propria voință și în parametrii legilor prevalente.<br/><br/>Astfel, munca independentă poate fi definită ca o activitate economică pe care cineva o poate desfășura pe cont propriu ca o ocupație lucrativă, și aceasta poate consta în producerea și vânzarea de bunuri, cumpărarea și vânzarea de bunuri sau prestarea de servicii pentru un preț. |
