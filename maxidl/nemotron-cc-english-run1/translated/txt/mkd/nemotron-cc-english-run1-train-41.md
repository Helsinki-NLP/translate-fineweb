| Bacopa<br/><br/>19 Nov 2015<br/>Posted by Doxiderol<br/><br/>Bacopa is a perennial plant that thrives in marshy subtropical and tropical regions around the globe. The highly regarded herb is a key ingredient in Doxiderol, a nutritional supplement that enhances cognitive function. Bacopa was chosen for its ability to protect the brain and increase acetylcholine, a biochemical messenger that enables the nervous system to relay information.<br/><br/>Ayurvedic practitioners first described the therapeutic properties of bacopa in 300 BC. The physicians recorded bacopa's abilities to enhance intelligence and memory. Nearly 2,500 years later, a growing body of modern research confirms the cognitive benefits of bacopa recorded in the Ayurvedic text.<br/><br/>In 1987, researchers in India evaluated the effects of bacopa on the intellectual function of school-aged children. During the four-week study, they administered bacopa to 40 children who were 6 to 8 years old. The scientists determined that bacopa increased perception and memory. The children were able to solve maze exercises quicker and more accurately after receiving bacopa. Many parents in India routinely use bacopa to enhance their children's intellectual development.<br/><br/>A 12-week study published in the August 2001 issue of Psychopharmacology investigated the effects of bacopa on cognitive function. Scientists randomly assigned the healthy volunteers, aged 18 to 65, to receive bacopa or an inactive substance. They also used a double-blind configuration for the study to conceal the identities of the products. Researchers use this design to ensure that the test results are valid because it eliminates bias by the researchers and participants. The bacopa group experienced a significant improvement in the speed at which they were able to process visual information. The participants also learned faster and stored new memories more efficiently.<br/><br/>In 2007, a Texas A&M College of Medicine laboratory study revealed one of the mechanisms responsible for bacopa's ability to promote brain health. According to the scientists, bacopa uses polyphenols to prevent oxidative stress and the damage that it causes to healthy brain cells. Bacopa also reduces harmful deposits of a substance known as beta-amyloid, which is the primary component of the plaque in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease.<br/><br/>A double-blind study published in the July 2008 issue of the Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine evaluated the effect of bacopa on elderly patients. The study confirmed that bacopa increased cognitive performance while reducing stress. According to the authors, the benefits achieved in this study confirmed the results of earlier research.<br/><br/>A 90-day study published in the December 2008 issue of Phytotherapy Research confirms the cognitive benefits that were previously demonstrated in other bacopa studies. Bacopa significantly improved the ability of the participants to temporarily store and use information required for completing a complex task. The double-blind study also demonstrated that bacopa reduced the time required to process visual information.<br/><br/>In addition to enhancing nerve signal transmission, the scientists theorize that bacopa increases cognitive function by reducing anxiety. Numerous studies indicate that anxiety interferes with the ability to perform tasks that require higher-level cognitive functions, such as learning and memorization. Stress disrupts biochemical messengers and healthy nerve signal transmission. Bacopa alleviates stress and restores a sense of calm by increasing acetylcholine levels, which reduces your heart rate and enables you to take deeper breaths.<br/><br/>Doxiderol is a great way to obtain the benefits of bacopa. This holistic supplement also contains other natural ingredients that promote brain health and support your ability to focus and concentrate on complex task as well as memorize information. | Бакопа<br/><br/>19 јуни 2015<br/>Објавено од Doxiderol<br/><br/>Bacopa е повеќегодишно растение кое напредува во мочурливи субтропски и тропски региони низ целиот свет. Високо почитуваната билка е клучна состојка во Doxiderol, хранлив додаток кој ја подобрува когнитивната функција. Бакопа е избрана поради нејзината способност да го заштити мозокот и да го зголеми ацетилхолинот, биохемиски гласник кој му овозможува на нервниот систем да пренесува информации.<br/><br/>Ајурведските лекари првпат ги опишале терапевтските својства на бакопа во 300 п.н.е. Лекарите ги забележале способностите на бакопа за подобрување на интелигенцијата и меморијата. Речиси 2.500 години подоцна, растечкото тело на модерните истражувања ги потврдува когнитивните придобивки од бакопата забележани во ајурведскиот текст.<br/><br/>Во 1987 година, истражувачите во Индија ги процениле ефектите на бакопата врз интелектуалната функција на децата на училишна возраст. Во текот на четиринеделната студија, тие дале бакопа на 40 деца на возраст од 6 до 8 години. Научниците утврдиле дека бакопа ја зголемила перцепцијата и меморијата. Децата биле во можност да ги решат вежбите на лавиринтот побрзо и попрецизно откако добиле бакопа. Многу родители во Индија рутински користат бакопа за да го подобрат интелектуалниот развој на своите деца.<br/><br/>Една 12-неделна студија објавена во изданието на Psychopharmacology во август 2001 година ги истражуваше ефектите на бакопа врз когнитивната функција. Научниците случајно ги доделија здравите волонтери, на возраст од 18 до 65 години, да добијат бакопа или неактивна супстанција. Тие, исто така, користеле двојно слепа конфигурација за студијата за да ги скријат идентитетите на производите. Истражувачите го користат овој дизајн за да се осигураат дека резултатите од тестовите се валидни, бидејќи ја елиминира пристрасноста од страна на истражувачите и учесниците. Групата бакопа доживеа значително подобрување во брзината со која беа способни да обработуваат визуелни информации. Учесниците исто така учеа побрзо и поефикасно складираа нови сеќавања.<br/><br/>Во 2007 година, лабораториската студија на колеџот за медицина во Тексас откри еден од механизмите одговорни за способноста на бакопата да го промовира здравјето на мозокот. Според научниците, бакопа користи полифеноли за да го спречи оксидативниот стрес и штетата што ја предизвикува на здравите мозочни клетки. Бакопа, исто така, ги намалува штетните депозити на супстанцата позната како бета-амилоид, која е примарна компонента на плаката во мозокот на пациентите со Алцхајмерова болест.<br/><br/>Двојно слепа студија објавена во јули 2008 година во списанието за алтернативна и комплементарна медицина го процени ефектот на бакопа врз постарите пациенти. Студијата потврди дека бакопа ги зголемува когнитивните перформанси додека го намалува стресот. Според авторите, придобивките постигнати во оваа студија ги потврдија резултатите од претходните истражувања.<br/><br/>90-дневната студија објавена во декември 2008 година во изданието на Phytotherapy Research ги потврдува когнитивните придобивки кои претходно беа демонстрирани во други Bacopa студии. Bacopa значително ја подобри способноста на учесниците привремено да ги чуваат и користат информациите потребни за завршување на сложена задача. Студијата со двојно слепо, исто така, покажа дека бакопа го намалува времето потребно за обработка на визуелни информации.<br/><br/>Покрај подобрувањето на преносот на нервните сигнали, научниците теоретизираат дека бакопа ја зголемува когнитивната функција со намалување на анксиозноста. Бројни студии покажуваат дека анксиозноста ја попречува способноста да се извршуваат задачи кои бараат когнитивни функции на повисоко ниво, како што се учење и меморирање. Стресот ги нарушува биохемиските гласници и здрав пренос на нервен сигнал. Бакопа го ублажува стресот и го враќа чувството на смиреност со зголемување на нивото на ацетилхолин, што го намалува отчукувањата на срцето и ви овозможува да дишите подлабоко.<br/><br/>Doxiderol е одличен начин да се добијат придобивките од bacopa. Овој холистички додаток, исто така, содржи други природни состојки кои го промовираат здравјето на мозокот и ја поддржуваат вашата способност да се фокусирате и да се концентрирате на сложена задача, како и да меморирате информации. |

She can also sense demonic auras as well as evil auras. When she was born and growing, however, her powers were sealed and she was much less powerful. Since the defeat of the one sealing her powers, Kagome has reached her full potential.<br/><br/>PURIFICATION By making a physical connection, Kagome has the ability to purify both poison and darkness from a subject (living and inanimate). To do so, she projects her spiritual powers through her hand.<br/><br/>SPIRITUAL BARRIERS With her full potential, Kagome has the ability to create a barrier around herself and expand it around others. It is a dome-shaped barrier that can destroy weak demons that make contact with the barrier.<br/><br/>IMPROVED EYESIGHT<br/>Kagome has the ability to see things that are often invisible to the human eye: ghosts, spirits, divine and evil auras.<br/><br/>ABILITIES WITH WEAPONS<br/>Kagome has the ability to use a bow and arrow. She has been self trained, and after years of practice, her arrow rarely misses its mark. Alongside this, Kagome has the ability to infuse her arrows with powers. She can infuse an arrows with her spiritual powers which allows them to penetrate demonic forces, destroy spells, and purify objects. She can infuse her bow with her powers and deflect enemy attacks. She has the ability to infuse her arrows with purifying energy to purify poison as well as powerful, long distant demonic attacks. And, finally, she has the ability to bypass others with her arrow: If her target happens to be behind a barrier or a hostage, the arrow can teleport and hit only her target<br/><br/>The rest of her abilities have become rather unimportant as they are related to time travel (through the Bone Eater's Well), the Shikon Jewel, or her previous incarnation.<br/><br/>the canon<br/><br/>Kagome has been pulled a few days after her high school graduation, however, before the Bone Eater's Well has opened again to allow her to return to the past permanently.<br/><br/>freestyle<br/><br/>memories<br/><br/>かごめ<br/><br/>The sound of her name was a soft whisper in the back of her mind, like a call muffled by the wind. It was the sound of a distant memory, a voice that she had started to forget but desperately clung to all the same. It was her mother's voice, twisted in the sorrow of her lost daughter. Afterall, Kagome banished without a trace. She vividly remembered those moments, the way the day had begun, what she had for breakfast and the last thing she had said to her mother. It was haunting, those memories, because it was like any other time she had slipped between worlds. She had woken, listless, because she had no purpose outside of school. She could find a job, and was scheduled for an interview that day. Her heart hadn't been in it, but it was what she needed to do.<br/><br/>She remembered the feeling of dread, sucking it up and giving herself a pep talk that she could do this. That she could progress in the life that she was meant to now that things had been settled in the past. Of course, she had the lingering feeling that she no longer belonged in her own time or her own life. Not with everything that she had left behind.<br/><br/>Kagome remembered the feeling of the wood beneath her fingers, the way her hand had curled into the handle to slide the door open. She remembered that she paused, turning to her mother with a bright and vibrant smile as she shook herself from her stupor. "I'm taking off." She remembered how strong her voice sounded, the smile on her mother's lips as her eyes shone with pride. Her mother bade her farewell, which didn't seem any different than before but somehow the weight of the words settled in heavier on Kagome's shoulders the more she reflected.<br/><br/>Briefly, the thoughts flickered forward, wondering if her mother worried over her, missed her like she did. Kagome could openly admit that her mother's strength, her support for the fact that her daughter slipped through time so frequently. There were times when she thought herself weak for not having the woman to lean on.<br/><br/>However, she remembered that she did muster up a meager amount of strength.She could remember the shift in the air, the temperature notably different than what she had expected, blinking at the sudden and unfamiliar surroundings. It was not her family's shrine. And when she turned to go back, to slip through the door she had come through, she was met with unfamiliar and cold metal beneath her fingertips and an interior that was not the entrance of her house. A man stood before her, behind a counter, who stared at her with eyes as wide as her own.<br/><br/>She didn't panic, at least. Being torn through time and placed in impossible situations at least built your willpower as far as strange happenings went. Because it wasn't every day that someone found themselves dragged into the past by a demon, intent on ripping a powerful jewel from their body that they didn't even know was there. And then there was the fact that she had shattered said powerful jewel into who knows how many pieces and was tasked on finding them. Such things were not normal, and she had needed to square up and roll with it once she realized that was her reality. It had seemed so simple, just gather the shards and fix the jewel.<br/><br/>But it hadn't been easy, there were many demons after the shards and the jewel itself. And one particularly powerful demon with a wish that he was determined to see fulfilled. To this day, she had never learned his wish but knew it had never been granted even once he had the blasted thing completed. He had ruined so many lives for the sake of nothing. Ruined so many lives for such a futile task. Naraku had been the most difficult foe, and the one who had been the center of everything that had gone wrong in all of her friend's lives.<br/><br/>But, it was that unpredicability, that necessity to roll with what was happening and the willpower that she had gained from her adventure that she remembered drawing upon to come up with a story that fit in the moment that didn't seem too whimsical or far fetched. She needed to be believed, she needed to survive.<br/><br/>Afterall, she faced worse than a man in a camera store. She had lied through her teeth to save her life before.<br/><br/>"I was looking for a job." In the end, it wasn't a complete lie. After all, she had set out of her house with the intent of attending a job interview. Her state of dress would at least attest to that much. It was one of the easier fibs she had ever told.<br/><br/>And, for some reason, that crazy man hired her.<br/><br/>かごめ<br/><br/>Kagomed rolled over in her bed as she pushed back the distant memories, refusing to acknowledge that she was really awake. She clawed at the last glimpses of sleep, begging it to return and to take her back into its embrace. She closed her eyes, willing sleep to come and was only met with memories. The echoes of a song sang in the distance of her memories, a song that had often tormented her, given the same name as her. The voice that sang was no longer reminiscent of her mother, but the voices of children who she had often played with growing up. They called back the memories, even though it had been years since she started this live, even though she was happy in this life, the call of these memories was too loud.<br/><br/>Suddenly, she was falling back into them and sleep evaded her again. She was watching herself in her family's embrace while Inuyasha was pulled back into the well, looking as startled as she had felt. The memories of that moment, those feelings, were still so strong. The feeling of heartbreak and sorrow welled up again though it had been so long since she had felt like she had been ripped away from everything that mattered to her.<br/><br/>Of course her family mattered, and she was happy to be in their arms again. She could never fully, truly describe how she had felt in those days. She still couldn't explain the way she felt split in two, with warring desires to be in both her past and present. She remembered the futile attempts to jump through the well, fingers clawing at the ground in a desperate plea to let her return. The first month home, she didn't sleep so much as she cried.<br/><br/>Elysion had garnished a similar reaction, though it was not so fierce because she didn't know exactly where she had slipped through nor did she know where she could worm her way back. Her explorations were subtle between working her job and trying to settle herself into this life. She had no intentions of staying, no intentions of lingering longer than she needed. And while she didn't try as fiercely as she had when she tried to return to the past, her passion was tenfold because she had no ties to this world. Because she was truly alone… With no hope of anyone to reach her.<br/><br/>In her irrational moments, she thought the Jewel had pulled her back and found a new hell for her to reside in. A new hell that would force her to make a wish, but she remembered very clearly that she had wished it gone forever. That didn't stop her dreams, the times when she woke up in the night sobbing. And those memories of her past were the hardest to deal with, the hardest to forget. Her heart began to race in a panic as she turned in her bed again, her breath became a struggle as she fought against a panic attack induced by her wandering mind this late into the night.<br/><br/>She hated feeling so weak, so afraid.<br/><br/>籠の中の鳥は<br/><br/>Kagome finally pulled herself from bed, her room lit with a pale light that was enough to guide her to the bathroom. She stood before the mirror, the sink running while she stared at her reflection. Raven colored hair covered her face and she felt as bad as she looked. Her first morning in Elysion was similar to this, only she was in worse shape.<br/><br/>She had found a place to sleep, managing to work out a deal with the owner of the building to allow her to stay a small period of time without paying. Perhaps it had been Miroku's influence that allowed her to strike such deals, as the monk was known for his way in charming (or scamming) people into giving them more than enough for the work they had done. The monk had always been that way, since they had first met. He would claim the dwelling of a lord to be haunted when it was not or, claim that they were subject to an attack when they would not be. He would sell his wards and charms for such high prices. It worked practically every time and she wondered why people had been so willing to trust him.<br/><br/>Perhaps it was his smile, or the fact that he was a monk that the people of the past were so willing to crumble. He never preyed on the weak, at least. He always did what was right and he was a symbol of strength to her at times when he would push through everything in order to do what was right. He pushed through the fact that he was dying, that he was cursed, and tried to do something about it rather than wallowing in his fate. He had pushed himself to the limit in the time leading up to their final fight. And she had been glad that they had defeated Naraku before he could become subject to the same fate as his father, and his father before him.<br/><br/>As far as her own charms went, however, she was more fair than her friend and made the deal reasonable. She doubted that anyone in this world would pay a hefty price for an exorcism or banishing demons. They were too technologically advanced for that. But she was clever enough, and smart enough, to make a good deal.<br/><br/>But now, Kagome was in a better place though the look on her face looked the same. Haunted, tired, drained...<br/><br/>A quick glance at a clock on the wall told her that she could try to sleep longer. But she opted out of that, not wanting to face the flashbacks again. She took a shower instead, using the cold water to chase away her demons, to fill her lungs with a sharp intake of breath and force herself awake.<br/><br/>いついつ出やる<br/><br/>It didn't work.<br/><br/>Not in the way she was wanting. The cold water certainly forced the air into her lungs, forced her mind to wake and muscles to seize. A bitter laugh was pulled from her lips as she tilted her head back and found herself remembering more. Today, she wasn't going to escape them so easily. She wasn't going to recover so simply, to recover just because she willed it.<br/><br/>Sometimes, there's no avoiding the thoughts you wanted to. Even when you were certain that you were past them.<br/><br/>Sango would have been a great help in this situation. The demon slayer was her best friend, she would even go as far as to call her the sister that she never had. An older sister who was wise, always had her side when trouble arose. Particularly boy trouble, when such things were rather trivial but it was fun to have a crush and for her friend to be mad on her behalf when Inuyasha made her sad. After all, it had been often that the half-demon would run to his dead lover's side and break her heart more than once.<br/><br/>But, Sango also inspired her in other ways. After all the woman had faced, she had always been so strong, so sure... Even in the times that she had doubted herself, she always pulled through. She admired that she had the ability to survive after losing her whole family -- the reminder of this often pushed Kagome to survive, because she lost everyone to this world -- and then having her brother become a pawn of Naraku. It wasn't easy, couldn't have been something to that just anyone could face and still go forward with. She still smiled, even with that pain and those reminders... She was often so bright, even in the darker times.<br/><br/>And right now, she wanted to lean into the older woman's side, to take comfort in the fact that she was there and she was supportive. She felt that Sango would somehow pull through this, and offer some words of strength and understanding. It was times like these that made these spells worse, the constant reminder that she was without her family.<br/><br/>"I don't want to be alone." She cried aloud in her solitude, the sound of the shower drowning out the plea.<br/><br/>She wasn't afraid to admit it.<br/><br/>夜明けの晩に<br/><br/>Another hour had slipped by before she had realized it. Her skin was cold from the water and it felt like ice ran through her veins. She hadn't realized she had begun to shiver until her hand reached to turn off the water and end her shower. Kagome didn't seek her own gaze in the mirror again, instead, she wrapped herself in towels and trudged out of the bathroom, up the stairs and into her kitchen. She started on making a light breakfast, idly reading through her notes for the day as the food cooked.<br/><br/>Her career was really taking off these last years. Her photos were featured in many galleries, her name started to frequent many lips for those who were interested in photography.<br/><br/>The job she had asked for on a whim had sparked it all. She had been far more lucky than she had expected to be in this world. Never lucky enough to slip back through the cracks into her own world, but lucky enough to do well. As she turned back to the stove, she remembered the time she had finally given up on returning home. It was about two years into her life here, as she had started to venture into photography as more than just a hobby but something she could make a name for herself with.<br/><br/>That day had been particularly pleasant, the sun was high in the sky and she had found herself taking some photos of the natural scenery. A little boy had hidden in one of the plants, and she had caught a picture of the moment his face had settled into a cheerful, mischievous grin the moment before he had jumped out to startle his prey. It reminded her of Shippou, the little kitsune she had, essentially, adopted. He, too, had been torn from his family when they had first met. His father killed and he was determined to avenge him. While young, he did seem so mature in their first encounters.<br/><br/>Maybe it had been the influence of Inuyasha that allowed the kit to act like a kid again, to be young and whimsical at times while others he was more mature. He offered comfort to her in his own way, and she tried to care for him as she would her own though she had been so young then as well. However, her youth did not stop her from understanding how to tend to him or care for him like her child. Her heart swelled when he smiled, when he had been so happy for his gift of crayons and took the time to make art. She was so proud of each drawing that he had finished that she knew that this was how a mother would feel in such a situation.<br/><br/>The pain that had ripped through her was too much, too sudden. She missed him and wanted to see how much he had grown since she had been gone. She had missed so much...<br/><br/>To spare herself any further pain, any false hopes… She gave up. And focused on bettering herself.<br/><br/>鶴と亀が<br/><br/>Breakfast tasted bland, boring, and inspired. Only after she had finished did she realized she had forgotten to any sort of spices or flavor to the food. It was too late now to remember that much, as her mind was too busy remembering other details of her life that clearly had become more important than her food.<br/><br/>"Sit!"<br/><br/>Of course, nothing happened when she had angrily yelled at one particularly frustrating client that reminded her of the half-demon. He was being particularly stubborn and rude, wanting a photo taken his way rather than letting it work out naturally. You could try to force wild animals to behave how you wanted. But, rarely did anyone succeed with force. Inuyasha wasn't as bad, however. Inuyasha had learned before she had been forced away from him. He had become gentler, more understanding, more mature though there were times he was still childish and cocky.<br/><br/>She remember how red her cheeks had burned, but how she stood her ground and fired him. She told him she refused to work for anyone or with anyone who wanted to twist something beyond it's nature, beyond it's own desires.<br/><br/>She should have compared the man to Naraku rather than Inuyasha. Though her client did not have such extreme intentions. At least the feeling afterwards was a pleasant memory. The freedom of knowing that she had come so far that she could refuse work that she didn't want to do, to be her own person that was independent of others. She could say that she made it at that point. Even though she heard rumors days later with words meant to slander her.<br/><br/>She defended herself righteously, like she did towards the end of her journey. After all, she was the only one who could protect herself in this world.<br/><br/>滑った<br/><br/>Morning light began to creep into her home, reminding her again of the passage of time. Again, she considered the list of things she had to do and debated on where to start. Or, if she should even start at all. With how the day began, she didn't know if she could consider that a great idea. It was doubtful that she would be successful with how lost in herself she was becoming.<br/><br/>She didn't want to mess up her latest work. Because she had done that on a few occasions before. It wasn't pleasant to try and recover from a complete disaster.<br/><br/>Kagome remembered the feeling of her expensive, brand new, camera slipping from her hands. She wasn't prepared to support it, because she had just removed it from her bag. Part of her screamed on the inside. A dramatic, over-the-top, full on scream that she frequently did when she was much, much younger. When she was struggling to make it through middle school while hopping between times. The other part of her had remained frozen in place while her lense completely shattered and the rest of the camera had broken along with it.<br/><br/>Seeing Inuyasha's brother, a full demon, standing before her was the last thing she expected when she had made her way out for her photos. He stood as proud as ever, as tall as ever, as imposing as she remembered. He didn't look fazed at all to be in an entirely different world, though she was never the best at reading his mind. His name on her lips was so potent, that she could remember the tiniest feelings as she did. Her lips were chapped, her mouth felt dry, and the bubbling feeling of anxiety in her stomach made her feel sick.<br/><br/>She didn't want her hopes to be up.<br/><br/>But, she wanted him to be there, even if they were not friends. They were allies, if anything, since they had fought side by side. And something was better than absolutely nothing.<br/><br/>And Kagome had the sense enough not to throw herself at him, to wrap her arms around him in relief that knowing she was not alone. Her camera no longer mattered when she approached him. She remembered that nothing else mattered for days as she spent time with him, not speaking of their world but speaking (or, she was speaking and he simply acknowledged that fact).<br/><br/>When, exactly, she fell for him though… Kagome couldn't recall. It was a subtle thing, just like he was. But she knew the feeling was there. And he let her know that she was not alone in the fact that she had fallen, that feelings had somehow blossomed.<br/><br/>後ろの正面<br/><br/>A feeling of weightlessness overtook her and suddenly her eyes opened while her mind desperately clawed for the last thing she was doing. She didn't recall when she had fallen asleep on her couch, but she knew the last place she had been was on the far too comfortable cushions. She didn't struggle, however, or fight the weightlessness as she was in familiar arms. Her head tilted against Sesshoumaru's chest, taking comfort in the fact that he was here and she wasn't alone.<br/><br/>"Welcome back." His response was a soft hum in acknowledgement. He didn't need to speak much for her to understand his intent, or the rest of what he had to say.<br/><br/>He carried her back to her bed, settled her into it with ease. Her eyes met his and she smiled easily because no more memories drifted back, no more recollections teased at her. No, whenever he was near, she never fell back into those thoughts. He had helped, and the years had helped. Today was just… One of those days.<br/><br/>"Sleep." He commanded with ease, her eyes rolled at him but she did not fight because she was tired. Her hand clung tightly to him, while she felt his opposite hand press to her forehead in assessment of her wellbeing.<br/><br/>"I'm okay," she said, her words firm with her promise.<br/><br/>She was okay. She was alive. And she was happy.<br/><br/>だあれ<br/><br/>shipper<br/><br/>summary<br/><br/>Kagome, at one point in her life, was a rather regular teenage girl until she was attacked by a demon inside her family's well house. The demon dragged her down into the well, which magically transported her about 500 years into the past. There, she learned that a sacred jewel was encased inside her body as she was the reincarnation of a priestess that had died 50 years prior to the time she was dragged into. The jewel was ripped from her body and the demon that dragged her through time was defeated by the half-demon that she freed who was pinned to the tree. Kagome befriended the half-demon, Inuyasha, in time and traveled with him to restore the jewel that she, herself, shattered. Though it was not so straightforward and easy to do as many demons and humans sought the jewel for their own purposes. She befriended a young kitsune demon, a monk, and a demon slayer who all traveled with her to restore the jewel.<br/><br/>Her group, however, was not the one to complete the jewel. Instead, an evil half-demon who manipulated the majority of the major events in most of her companion's lives. When he finally collected all the pieces of the jewel and made his wish on the tainted object, Kagome was drawn into the jewel itself with the intent of her making a selfish wish to keep her trapped inside forever, keeping the jewel alive. It was the stubbornness of Inuyasha that managed to save her from the darkness. In the end, she returned to her natural time, finished high school as was expect from a girl of her timeline. Though days later, Kagome ended up in Elysion. She has been in this world for five years, and has long since given up on returning home. She's settled happily into her new life.<br/><br/>platonic<br/><br/>It's rather easy for Kagome to make new friends, she hasn't changed much from her youth. She is a cheerful young woman who is empathetic and welcoming to most of all in her life. In her youth, she befriended demons when most would fear them. Even demons that used to eat humans, she has befriended and she changed their ways (she'd like to think). This being said, it's really easy to become her friend as long as someone is able to shown that they are willing to be redeemed, or show that they are not completely evil. She feels greatly for everyone she meets, so it's hard for her not to be drawn to others in a desire to be friends.<br/><br/>antagonistic<br/><br/>The only way to earn Kagome's wrath is to be so deplorable, so evil, and so far beyond redemption that she can't see any good in you. And she can see the good in pretty much everyone and everything. Honestly, with whom she has faced? A half-demon that pitted two lovers against each other, that cursed the entire male line of one of her friends, and then had her best friend's brother kill their family… Yeah, I don't see her hating anyone without them really, really working for it. Feel free to give it a shot, though.<br/><br/>romantic<br/><br/>When in love, Kagome is a strong support, always staying there even when things may be rough. However, Kagome is not looking for love, wasn't looking for love when she arrived so any past relationships don't exist. This isn't to say that someone hasn't fallen in love with her. She can definitely be the subject of someone's unrequited love, she'll probably be oblivious about it, though. Finally, Kagome is currently engaged to Sesshoumaru, surprisingly. I'm totally open to potential AU things, though. <3<br/><br/>fandom hell<br/><br/>age ancient<br/><br/>species space queen<br/><br/>occupation dying<br/><br/>prefers she/her<br/><br/>awards<br/><br/>pro<br/>she/her est 62woo i suck at plot replies. but ok anyway!!! neptune is very friendly and has that 'cool' persona, he's really fun to be around, and he's SUPER good to work with. like he's super patient and he'll do anything she asks of him--he's really easy to work with, definitely in comparison to other models. so i love the idea of them being all work oriented friends at first and then turning into something more. neptune definitely tries to surround himself with people, because he loves having friends, and kagome is pretty much his type too? like she's sweet and she's a strong woman, and he is actually better friends with women than he is with men, idk why, he just loves being surrounded by female friends who knows. i love my guys being super good friends and protecting their girl friends honestly. but oh M A N i love pseduo-family type relationships and neptune is an only child, so he hasn't had any like, familial relationships like that. so her looking out for him all big sister like would make him be like ????? cause he's confused but also he actually really likes that LOL! they're both good kids, i think they'd be really fun ^^<br/><br/>fandom fire emblem: fates<br/><br/>age ninteen<br/><br/>species Part human / part dragon<br/><br/>occupation representative guardian<br/><br/>prefers she/her<br/><br/>awards<br/><br/>yonder<br/>she/her aest 20 posts<br/><br/>I haven't seen Inuyasha at all but... from what I've read Kagome seems to be one of those people who might be able to help Corrin out with her emotional state. There's a lot weighing on her mind since she had to fight her birth family against her will and last time she saw them they all pretty much hated her. Frankly she hasn't worked through everything yet since she was essentially at the head of a full-scale war. I feel they could be friends as Corrin is quite open in her personality, extremely trusting as well. She's just... hiding and struggling through a lot.

I love your idea of Kagome taking a pic of Elsa! You know, she's also a singer/performer at a local theater so I can imagine Kagome going there to scope things out and then catching Elsa backstage or something--and then the friendship could blossom from there! I absolutely adore the idea of these two spending quality bff time together doing the small but fun things Elsa never experienced as a child.

Таа исто така може да почувствува демонски аури, како и зли аури. Меѓутоа, кога се родила и пораснала, нејзините моќи биле запечатени и таа била многу помалку моќна. Од поразот на оној што ги запечатил нејзините моќи, Кагоме го достигна својот целосен потенцијал.<br/><br/>ОЧИСТУВАЊЕ Со создавање на физичка врска, Кагоме има способност да ги прочисти и отровот и темнината од субјектот (жив и нежив). За да го стори тоа, таа ги проектира своите духовни моќи преку нејзината рака.<br/><br/>Со својот целосен потенцијал, Кагоме има способност да создаде бариера околу себе и да ја прошири околу другите. Тоа е бариера во форма на купола која може да ги уништи слабите демони кои контактираат со бариерата.<br/><br/>ПОБОЉУВАЊЕ НА ОЧИТЕ<br/>Кагоме има способност да види работи кои често се невидливи за човечкото око: духови, духови, божествени и зли аури.<br/><br/>СПОСОБНОСТИ СО ОРУЖЈЕ<br/>Кагоме има способност да користи лак и стрела. Таа е само-обучена, и по години на пракса, нејзината стрела ретко ја пропушта својата ознака. Заедно со ова, Кагоме има способност да ги влива своите стрели со моќи. Таа може да внесе стрели со своите духовни моќи што им овозможува да продрат демонски сили, да ги уништат магиите и да ги прочистат предметите. Таа може да го внесе својот лак со своите моќи и да ги одбие непријателските напади. Таа има способност да ги влива своите стрели со прочистувачка енергија за да го прочисти отровот, како и моќни, далечни демонски напади. И, конечно, таа има способност да ги заобиколи другите со нејзината стрела: Ако нејзината мета се случи да биде зад бариера или заложник, стрелата може да се телепортира и да ја погоди само нејзината цел.<br/><br/>Остатокот од нејзините способности станале прилично неважни, бидејќи тие се поврзани со патувањето низ времето (преку Бунарот на коскените јадења), скапоценоста Шикон или нејзината претходна инкарнација.<br/><br/>канонот<br/><br/>Кагоме била повлечена неколку дена по нејзината средношколска диплома, сепак, пред Бунарот за коскени јадења повторно да се отвори за да ѝ овозможи трајно да се врати во минатото.<br/><br/>слободен стил<br/><br/>спомени<br/><br/>かごめ<br/><br/>Звукот на нејзиното име беше мек шепот во задниот дел на нејзиниот ум, како повик пригушен од ветрот. Тоа беше звук на далечен спомен, глас кој таа почна да заборави, но очајно се држи за сите исто. Тоа беше гласот на нејзината мајка, извртен во тагата на нејзината изгубена ќерка. На крајот на краиштата, Кагоме беше протерана без трага. Таа живо се сеќаваше на тие моменти, начинот на кој започна денот, она што го имаше за појадок и последното нешто што му го кажа на својата мајка. Тоа беше прогонувачки, тие сеќавања, бидејќи тоа беше како и секој друг пат таа се лизгаше помеѓу светови. Таа се разбуди, безволни, бидејќи таа немаше цел надвор од училиште. Таа можеше да се најде работа, и беше закажано за интервју тој ден. Нејзиното срце не беше во неа, но тоа беше она што таа требаше да го направи.<br/><br/>Таа се сеќаваше на чувството на страв, вшмукување и давање на себе пеп разговор дека таа може да го направи ова. Дека таа може да напредува во животот дека таа беше наменета за сега дека работите биле решени во минатото. Се разбира, имала долготрајно чувство дека повеќе не припаѓа во своето време или во својот живот. Не со сѐ што оставила зад себе.<br/><br/>Кагоме се сеќаваше на чувството на дрвото под нејзините прсти, начинот на кој нејзината рака се свиткала во рачката за да ја отвори вратата. Се сеќаваше дека застана, се сврте кон мајка си со светла и енергична насмевка додека се тресеше од ступорот. "Јас заминувам." Таа се сеќаваше колку силен нејзиниот глас звучеше, насмевката на усните на нејзината мајка како нејзините очи сјаеше со гордост. Нејзината мајка се збогуваше со неа, што не изгледаше поинаку од порано, но некако тежината на зборовите се смести потешко на рамениците на Кагоме колку повеќе се одразуваше.<br/><br/>Накратко, мислите трепереа напред, прашувајќи се дали нејзината мајка е загрижена за неа, ја пропушти како што таа го стори. Кагоме можеше отворено да признае дека силата на нејзината мајка, нејзината поддршка за фактот дека нејзината ќерка се лизгаше низ времето толку често. Имаше моменти кога мислеше дека е слаба затоа што не можеше да се потпре на жената.<br/><br/>Сепак, таа се сетила дека собра мала количина на сила. Таа можеше да се сети на промената во воздухот, температурата значително поинаква од она што го очекуваше, трепкајќи на ненадејната и непозната околина. И кога таа се сврте да се врати, да се извлече низ вратата што ја поминала, таа беше пресретната со непознат и ладен метал под нејзините прсти и внатрешноста која не беше влезот на нејзината куќа. Еден човек стоеше пред неа, зад шалтер, кој зјапаше во неа со очи широки како нејзиниот.<br/><br/>Барем не паничила, бидејќи била искината низ времето и ставена во невозможни ситуации, барем ја изградила твојата волја до каде што стигнале чудните настани. Бидејќи не се случува секој ден некој да се најде вовлечен во минатото од демон, со намера да откине моќен скапоцен камен од своето тело за кој не ни знаеле дека е таму. И тогаш имаше фактот дека таа се скрши рече моќен скапоцен камен во кој знае колку парчиња и имаше задача да ги најде. Таквите работи не беа нормални, и таа требаше да се квадрат и се тркалаат со тоа откако ќе сфати дека тоа е нејзината реалност. Изгледаше толку едноставно, само собери ги парчињата и поправи го накитот.<br/><br/>Но, тоа не беше лесно, имаше многу демони по парчињата и самиот скапоцен камен. И еден особено моќен демон со желба дека тој е решен да види исполнување. До денес, таа никогаш не го научил неговата желба, но знаеше дека тоа никогаш не била исполнета дури и откако тој имаше експлозија нешто заврши. Тој имаше уништени толку многу животи за доброто на ништо. Уништени толку многу животи за таква залудна задача. Нараку беше најтешкиот непријател и оној кој беше во центарот на сè што тргна наопаку во животот на нејзиниот пријател.<br/><br/>Но, тоа беше таа непредвидливост, таа потреба да се тркала со она што се случува и силата на волјата што ја стекнала од нејзината авантура на која се сеќаваше дека цртајќи ја да излезе со приказна која се вклопува во моментот што не изгледаше премногу каприциозна или далеку добиена. Таа требаше да верува, таа требаше да преживее.<br/><br/>На крајот на краиштата, таа се соочила со полошо од човек во продавница за камери. Таа лажеше низ забите за да си го спаси животот претходно.<br/><br/>"Барав работа." На крајот, тоа не беше комплетна лага. На крајот на краиштата, таа излегла од нејзината куќа со намера да присуствува на интервју за работа. Нејзината состојба на облекување барем ќе сведочи за тоа. Тоа беше една од полесните влакна што некогаш ја кажала.<br/><br/>И поради некоја причина, лудакот ја вработил.<br/><br/>かごめ<br/><br/>Кагомед се преврте во креветот додека ги туркаше далечните спомени, одбивајќи да признае дека навистина е будна. Таа се канџи во последните погледи на спиењето, молејќи го да се врати и да ја земе назад во својата прегратка. Таа ги затвори очите, сакајќи да заспие и беше сретната само со сеќавања. Ехото на песната пееше во далечината на нејзините сеќавања, песна која често ја мачеше, дадена со истото име како неа. Гласот што пееше повеќе не потсетуваше на нејзината мајка, туку на гласовите на децата со кои таа често си играше додека растеше. Тие ги повратија спомените, иако поминаа години откако таа го започна ова во живо, иако таа беше среќна во овој живот, повикот на овие спомени беше премногу гласен.<br/><br/>Одеднаш, таа падна назад во нив и спиењето ја избегнуваше повторно. Таа се гледаше себеси во прегратката на нејзиното семејство, додека Инујаша беше повлечена назад во бунарот, гледајќи како исплашен како што се чувствуваше. Сеќавањата на тој момент, тие чувства, сѐ уште беа толку силни. Чувството на скршено срце и тага повторно се засили, иако беше толку одамна откако таа се чувствуваше како да е одземена од сѐ што ѝ значеше.<br/><br/>Се разбира, нејзиното семејство беше важно, и таа беше среќна што повторно е во нивните раце. Таа никогаш не можеше целосно, навистина да опише како се чувствувала во тие денови. Таа сеуште не можеше да го објасни начинот на кој се чувствуваше поделена на две, со завојувани желби да биде и во нејзиното минато и сегашност. Таа се сеќаваше на залудни обиди да скокне низ бунарот, прсти канџи на земјата во очајна молба да ја пушти да се врати. Првиот месец кога се вратила дома, не спиела толку многу колку што плачела.<br/><br/>Елисион имала слична реакција, иако тоа не било толку жестоко, бидејќи не знаела точно каде поминала, ниту знаела каде би можела да се врати на патот назад. Нејзините истражувања беа суптилни помеѓу работата и обидот да се смири во овој живот. Таа немаше намера да остане, немаше намера да остане подолго отколку што ѝ требаше. И иако не се обидуваше толку жестоко како кога се обидуваше да се врати во минатото, нејзината страст беше десетократна бидејќи немаше врски со овој свет, бидејќи беше навистина сама... без надеж дека некој ќе ја достигне.<br/><br/>Во нејзините ирационални моменти, таа мислеше дека скапоцен камен ја повлече назад и најде нов пекол за неа да живее во. Нов пекол кој ќе ја принуди да направи желба, но таа се сеќаваше многу јасно дека посакала да замина засекогаш. Тоа не ги сопре нејзините соништа, времињата кога се разбуди во ноќта и плачеше, а тие сеќавања од нејзиното минато беа најтешки за справување, најтешки за заборавање. Нејзиното срце почна да трча во паника како таа се сврте во нејзиниот кревет повторно, нејзиниот здив стана борба како што таа се бореше против нападот на паника предизвикани од нејзиниот скитник ум оваа доцна во ноќта.<br/><br/>Таа мразеше да се чувствува толку слаба, толку исплашена.<br/><br/>籠の中の鳥は<br/><br/>Кагоме конечно се повлече од креветот, нејзината соба осветлена со бледо светло што беше доволно за да ја води до бањата. Таа стоеше пред огледалото, мијалникот работи додека таа зјапаше во нејзиниот одраз. Равен боја коса покри лицето и таа се чувствува како лошо како што изгледаше. Нејзиното прво утро во Елисион беше сличен на ова, само што таа беше во полоша форма.<br/><br/>Таа најде место за спиење, успевајќи да склучи договор со сопственикот на зградата за да ѝ овозможи да остане малку време без да плати. Можеби влијанието на Мироку ѝ овозможило да склучи такви договори, бидејќи монахот бил познат по својот начин на шармирање (или измама) на луѓето да им даде повеќе од доволно за работата што ја направиле. Монахот отсекогаш бил таков, бидејќи тие за прв пат се сретнале. Тој ќе тврди дека живеалиштето на еден лорд да биде прогонувано кога тоа не било или, тврдат дека тие биле предмет на напад кога тие не би биле. Тој ќе ги продаде своите одделенија и чари за такви високи цени. Тоа функционираше речиси секој пат и таа се прашуваше зошто луѓето беа толку подготвени да му веруваат.<br/><br/>Можеби тоа беше неговата насмевка, или фактот дека тој беше монах дека луѓето од минатото беа толку подготвени да се распадне. Тој никогаш не лови на слабите, барем. Секогаш го правел она што било исправно и тој бил симбол на сила за неа во моменти кога би поминал низ сè за да го направи она што е исправно. Тој се туркаше низ фактот дека умира, дека е проколнат, и се обиде да направи нешто во врска со тоа, наместо да се валка во својата судбина. Тој се туркаше до границата во времето што водеше до нивната последна борба. И таа била среќна што го поразиле Нараку пред тој да стане предмет на истата судбина како неговиот татко, и неговиот татко пред него.<br/><br/>Што се однесува до нејзините сопствени чари отиде, сепак, таа беше пофер од нејзината пријателка и го направи договорот разумно. Таа се сомневаше дека секој во овој свет ќе плати висока цена за егзорцизам или протерување демони. Тие беа премногу технолошки напредни за тоа. Но, таа беше доволно паметна и доволно паметна за да направи добра зделка.<br/><br/>Но сега, Кагоме беше на подобро место, иако изгледот на нејзиното лице изгледаше исто. Прогонувана, уморна, исцрпена...<br/><br/>Брз поглед на часовникот на ѕидот ѝ кажа дека може да се обиде да спие подолго. Но, таа се одлучи од тоа, не сакаат да се соочат со флешбекови повторно. Наместо тоа, таа се истуширала, користејќи ја студената вода за да ги протера своите демони, да ги наполни белите дробови со остар здив и да се разбуди.<br/><br/>いついつ出やる<br/><br/>Не успеа.<br/><br/>Не на начинот на кој таа сакаше. Студената вода сигурно го принуди воздухот во нејзините бели дробови, го принуди нејзиниот ум да се разбуди и мускулите да се фатат. Горчливата смеа беше извлечена од нејзините усни додека ја наведна главата назад и се најде себеси да се сеќава повеќе. Денес, таа немаше да побегне од нив толку лесно. Таа немаше да се опорави толку едноставно, да се опорави само затоа што таа го сакаше тоа.<br/><br/>Понекогаш, не можеш да ги избегнеш мислите што си ги сакал, дури и кога си бил сигурен дека си ги поминал.<br/><br/>Санго би била голема помош во оваа ситуација. Убиецот на демони беше нејзин најдобар пријател, таа дури и ќе оди толку далеку што ќе ја нарече сестрата што никогаш не ја имала. Постара сестра која беше мудра, секогаш ја имаше нејзината страна кога се појавија неволји. Особено машки проблеми, кога таквите работи беа прилично тривијални, но беше забавно да се заљуби и за нејзината пријателка да биде лута во нејзино име кога Инујаша ја направи тажна. На крајот на краиштата, често се случувало полу-демонот да трча до страната на својата мртва љубовница и да ѝ го скрши срцето повеќе од еднаш.<br/><br/>Но, Санго ја инспирираше и на други начини. По сето тоа со што се соочила жената, таа отсекогаш била толку силна, толку сигурна... Дури и во времињата кога се сомневала во себе, секогаш се извлекувала. Се восхитувала на тоа дека имала способност да преживее откако го изгубила целото семејство -- потсетникот на ова често ја туркал Кагоме да преживее, бидејќи ги изгубила сите во овој свет -- а потоа нејзиниот брат станал пион на Нараку. Не беше лесно, не можеше да биде нешто со што само некој можеше да се соочи и сеуште да оди напред со. Таа сеуште се насмевна, дури и со таа болка и оние потсетници... Таа често беше толку светла, дури и во помрачните времиња.<br/><br/>И токму сега, таа сакаше да се потпре на страната на постарата жена, да се утеши во фактот дека таа беше таму и таа беше поддршка. Таа чувствуваше дека Санго некако ќе се повлече низ ова, и да понуди некои зборови на сила и разбирање. Времињата како овие ги влошија овие магии, постојаното потсетување дека таа е без семејството.<br/><br/>"Не сакам да бидам сам." Таа извика гласно во нејзината осаменост, звукот на тушот се дави од молбата.<br/><br/>Таа не се плашеше да го признае тоа.<br/><br/>夜明けの晩に<br/><br/>Уште еден час поминал пред да го сфати тоа. Нејзината кожа беше ладна од водата и се чувствуваше како мраз течеше низ нејзините вени. Таа не сфати дека почна да трепери додека нејзината рака достигна да ја исклучи водата и да го заврши својот туш. Кагоме не го бараше својот поглед во огледалото повторно, наместо тоа, таа се завитка во крпи и излегуваше од бањата, нагоре по скалите и во нејзината кујна. Таа почнала да готви лесен појадок, невнимателно читајќи ги нејзините белешки за денот додека готвела храната.<br/><br/>Нејзината кариера навистина започна во последниве години. Нејзините фотографии беа објавени во многу галерии, нејзиното име почна да ги чести многу усни за оние кои се заинтересирани за фотографија.<br/><br/>Работата што ја побара од каприц предизвика сето тоа. Таа беше многу посреќна отколку што очекуваше да биде во овој свет. Никогаш не беше доволно среќна да се врати низ пукнатините во сопствениот свет, но доволно среќна да направи добро. Додека се враќала на шпоретот, се сеќавала на времето кога конечно се откажала од враќањето дома. Тоа беше околу две години во нејзиниот живот тука, бидејќи таа почна да се впуштат во фотографија како повеќе од само хоби, но нешто што може да се направи име за себе со.<br/><br/>Тој ден беше особено пријатен, сонцето беше високо на небото и таа се најде себеси фотографирање на природните пејзажи. Мало момче се криеше во една од растенијата, и таа беше фатен слика на моментот неговото лице се смири во весела, непослушен насмевка во моментот пред тој скокна надвор да го исплаши својот плен. Тоа ја потсети на Shippou, малку kitsune таа, во суштина, усвојени. Тој, исто така, беше оттргнат од неговото семејство кога тие прв пат се сретнаа. Неговиот татко уби и тој беше решен да го одмазди. Додека бил млад, изгледал многу зрело на нивните први средби.<br/><br/>Можеби влијанието на Инујаша му овозможило на комплетот повторно да се однесува како дете, да биде млад и каприциозен понекогаш, додека други биле позрели. Тој ѝ понудил утеха на неа на свој начин, и таа се обидела да се грижи за него како што таа би ја сопствена, иако таа беше толку млада тогаш, како и. Сепак, нејзината младост не ја спречи да разбере како да се грижи за него или да се грижи за него како нејзиното дете. Нејзиното срце отекуваше кога тој се насмевна, кога тој беше толку среќен за неговиот подарок на моливи и одвојуваше време да направи уметност. Таа беше толку горда на секој цртеж што тој завршил што знаеше дека така ќе се чувствува мајката во таква ситуација.<br/><br/>Болката која ја прободе беше премногу, премногу ненадејна. Таа го пропушти и сакаше да види колку тој порасна откако ја немаше. Таа пропушти толку многу ...<br/><br/>За да се поштеди од понатамошна болка, лажни надежи... се откажа и се фокусираше на подобрување.<br/><br/>鶴と亀が<br/><br/>Појадок вкус меки, здодевни, и инспириран. Дури откако таа заврши сфати дека таа заборавила на било каков вид на зачини или вкус на храната. Сега беше предоцна да се сеќавам на тоа, бидејќи нејзиниот ум беше премногу зафатен со сеќавање на други детали од нејзиниот живот кои очигледно станаа поважни од нејзината храна.<br/><br/>"Седни!"<br/><br/>Се разбира, ништо не се случи кога таа луто викаше на еден особено фрустрирачки клиент кој ја потсетуваше на полу-демон. Тој беше особено тврдоглав и груб, сакајќи фотографија направена на негов начин, наместо да дозволи тоа да функционира природно. Можете да се обидете да ги принудите дивите животни да се однесуваат како што сакате. Но, ретко некој успеа со сила. Инујаша не беше толку лош, сепак. Инујаша научил пред таа била принудена да се оддалечи од него. Тој стана нежен, повеќе разбирање, повеќе зрел, иако имаше моменти тој се уште беше дете и самоуверен.<br/><br/>Таа се сеќава како црвени нејзините образи изгорени, но како таа стоеше на земјата и го отпушти. Таа му рече дека одбива да работи за никого или со секој кој сака да изврти нешто надвор од нејзината природа, надвор од нејзините сопствени желби.<br/><br/>Таа требаше да го спореди човекот со Нараку, наместо Инујаша. Иако нејзиниот клиент немаше такви екстремни намери. Барем чувството после тоа беше пријатно сеќавање. Слободата да знае дека стигнала толку далеку што можела да одбие работа што не сакала да ја направи, да биде своја личност која била независна од другите. Можела да каже дека го направила тоа во тој момент. И покрај тоа што слушнала гласини неколку дена подоцна со зборови кои требало да ја навредат.<br/><br/>Таа се бранеше праведно, како што правеше на крајот од своето патување. На крајот на краиштата, таа беше единствената која можеше да се заштити во овој свет.<br/><br/>滑った<br/><br/>Утринската светлина почна да се проширува во нејзиниот дом, потсетувајќи ја повторно на поминување на времето. Повторно, таа ја разгледуваше листата на работи што требаше да ги направи и дебатираше за тоа од каде да започне. Или, дали воопшто треба да започне. Со тоа како започна денот, таа не знаеше дали може да смета дека тоа е одлична идеја. Беше сомнително дека таа ќе биде успешна со тоа колку изгубена во себе таа станува.<br/><br/>Таа не сакаше да ја зафркне нејзината последна работа. Бидејќи таа го направи тоа во неколку прилики порано. Тоа не беше пријатно да се обиде да се опорави од целосна катастрофа.<br/><br/>Кагоме се сеќаваше на чувството на нејзината скапа, сосема нова, камера што и се лизгаше од рацете. Таа не беше подготвена да го поддржи, бидејќи штотуку го извади од торбата. Дел од неа врескаше одвнатре. Драматичен, над-на врвот, исполнет со врескање што често го правеше кога беше многу, многу помлада. Кога се бореше да го преживее средното училиште додека скокаше помеѓу времињата. Другиот дел од неа останал замрзнат додека леќата целосно се скршила, а остатокот од камерата се скршил заедно со неа.<br/><br/>Гледајќи го братот на Инујаша, исполнет демон, стоеше пред неа беше последното нешто што таа го очекуваше кога таа го направи својот пат надвор за нејзините фотографии. Тој стоеше како горди како и секогаш, како висок како и секогаш, како наметлива како што се сеќава. Тој воопшто не изгледаше фазиран да биде во сосема поинаков свет, иако таа никогаш не беше најдобра во читањето на неговите мисли. Неговото име на нејзините усни беше толку моќно, што таа можеше да се сети на најмалите чувства како што направи. Нејзините усни беа испукани, устата се чувствуваше сува, а чувството на анксиозност во нејзиниот стомак ја натера да се чувствува лошо.<br/><br/>Таа не сакаше нејзините надежи да бидат горе.<br/><br/>Но, таа сакаше тој да биде таму, дури и ако тие не беа пријатели. Тие беа сојузници, ако ништо друго, бидејќи тие се бореле рамо до рамо. И нешто беше подобро од апсолутно ништо.<br/><br/>А Кагоме имаше доволно смисла да не се фрли на него, да ги обвие рацете околу него со олеснување што знаејќи дека таа не е сама. Нејзината камера повеќе не беше важно кога таа му се приближи. Таа се сеќаваше дека ништо друго не е важно со денови кога поминувала време со него, не зборувајќи за нивниот свет, туку зборувајќи (или, таа зборуваше и тој едноставно го признал тој факт).<br/><br/>Кога, токму, таа се заљубила во него... Кагоме не можеше да се сети. Тоа беше суптилна работа, исто како и тој. Но, таа знаеше дека чувството е таму. И тој ѝ кажа дека таа не е сама во фактот дека таа падна, дека чувствата некако цутеа.<br/><br/>後ろの正面<br/><br/>Чувство на бестежинскост ја зафати и одеднаш нејзините очи се отворија додека нејзиниот ум очајно канџи за последното нешто што го правеше. Таа не се сеќавам кога таа заспа на нејзиниот кауч, но таа знаеше дека последното место таа беше на премногу удобни перници. Таа не се борат, сепак, или се борат со бестежински како што беше во познати раце. Нејзината глава се наведна кон градите на Сешумару, земајќи утеха во фактот дека тој беше тука и таа не беше сама.<br/><br/>"Добредојдовте назад." Неговиот одговор беше мек ѕвон во признавање. Тој не треба да се зборува многу за неа да се разбере неговата намера, или остатокот од она што има да се каже.<br/><br/>Тој ја однесе назад во нејзиниот кревет, се населил во неа со леснотија. Нејзините очи го сретнаа неговиот и таа се насмевна лесно, бидејќи нема повеќе спомени лебдеше назад, нема повеќе сеќавања закануваа на неа. Не, секогаш кога тој беше во близина, таа никогаш не падна назад во тие мисли. Тој помогна, и годините помогнаа. Денес беше само... еден од тие денови.<br/><br/>"Спие." Тој командуваше со леснотија, нејзините очи се тркалаа кон него, но таа не се бореше, бидејќи таа беше уморна. Нејзината рака цврсто се држи до него, додека таа чувствуваше неговата спротивна рака притиснете на челото во проценка на нејзината благосостојба.<br/><br/>"Јас сум во ред", рече таа, нејзините зборови цврсто со своето ветување.<br/><br/>Беше во ред, беше жива и среќна.<br/><br/>だあれ<br/><br/>шпедитерот<br/><br/>Резиме<br/><br/>Кагоме, во еден момент од нејзиниот живот, била прилично редовна тинејџерка додека не била нападната од демон во куќата на нејзиното семејство. Демонот ја одвлекол во бунарот, кој магично ја пренел околу 500 години во минатото. Таму дознала дека во нејзиното тело бил заробен свет скапоцен камен, бидејќи таа била реинкарнација на свештеничка која починала 50 години пред да биде влечена во неа. Накитот бил откинат од нејзиното тело, а демонот кој ја влечел низ времето бил поразен од полу-демонот кој таа го ослободила, кој бил прикован за дрвото. Кагоме се спријатели со полу-демон, Inuyasha, во времето и патуваше со него за да се врати скапоцен камен што таа, себе, се скрши. Иако тоа не беше толку едноставна и лесно да се направи како многу демони и луѓето бараат скапоцен камен за свои цели. Таа се спријателила со млад кицуне демон, монах и убиец на демони, кој патувал со неа за да го врати скапоцен камен.<br/><br/>Нејзината група, сепак, не беше таа што го заврши накитот. Наместо тоа, злобен полу-демон кој манипулираше со поголемиот дел од главните настани во поголемиот дел од животот на нејзиниот придружник. Кога конечно ги собрал сите парчиња од скапоцениот камен и ја изразил својата желба за скапоцениот предмет, Кагоме била привлечена во самиот скапоцен камен со намера да направи себична желба да ја задржи заробена внатре засекогаш, одржувајќи го скапоцен камен жив. Токму тврдоглавоста на Инујаша успеала да ја спаси од темнината. На крајот, таа се вратила во своето природно време, завршила средно училиште како што се очекувало од девојка од нејзината временска линија. Иако неколку дена подоцна, Кагоме завршила во Елисион. Таа е во овој свет веќе пет години, и одамна се откажа од враќањето дома. Таа се населила среќно во нејзиниот нов живот.<br/><br/>платонски<br/><br/>Тоа е прилично лесно за Кагоме да се направи нови пријатели, таа не се промени многу од нејзината младост. Таа е весела млада жена која е емпатична и добредојде за повеќето од сите во нејзиниот живот. Во нејзината младост, таа се спријатели со демони кога повеќето ќе се плашат од нив. Дури и демоните кои ги јаделе луѓето, таа се спријателила и го променила нивниот начин на размислување. Тоа се вели, тоа е навистина лесно да се стане нејзин пријател сè додека некој е во состојба да покаже дека тие се подготвени да бидат откупени, или да покаже дека тие не се целосно зло. Таа чувствува многу за сите што ги среќава, па затоа ѝ е тешко да не биде привлечена кон другите во желбата да биде пријател.<br/><br/>антагонистички<br/><br/>Единствениот начин да го заработите гневот на Кагоме е да бидете толку жалосни, толку зли и толку далеку од искупување што не може да види ништо добро во вас. И таа може да го види доброто во речиси секој и сè. Искрено, со кого се соочила? Полу-демон кој ги сврте двајца љубовници еден против друг, кој ја проколна целата машка линија на еден од нејзините пријатели, а потоа братот на нејзиниот најдобар пријател го уби нивното семејство... Слободно да му дадете шанса.<br/><br/>романтична<br/><br/>Кога е заљубена, Кагоме е силна поддршка, секогаш останува таму дури и кога работите можат да бидат груби. Сепак, Кагоме не бара љубов, не беше во потрага по љубов кога пристигна, па не постојат никакви минати врски. Ова не значи дека некој не се заљубил во неа. Таа дефинитивно може да биде предмет на нечија неузвратена љубов, иако веројатно ќе биде заборавена за тоа. Конечно, Кагоме во моментов е ангажиран со Сешумару, изненадувачки. Сепак, јас сум целосно отворен за потенцијални АУ работи, сепак. <3<br/><br/>фандом пеколот<br/><br/>античкото<br/><br/>видови вселенски кралица<br/><br/>Окупацијата умира<br/><br/>претпочита таа / таа<br/><br/>награди<br/><br/>pro she / her est 62woo i suck at parcela replies. но во ред во секој случај!!! нептун е многу пријателски и има таа "кул" персона, тој е навистина забавно да се биде околу, и тој е СУПЕР добро да се работи со. како да е супер-трпелив и ќе направи се што таа ќе побара од него--тој е навистина лесен за работа, дефинитивно во споредба со другите модели. па ми се допаѓа идејата дека сите тие се прво работно ориентирани пријатели, а потоа се претвораат во нешто повеќе. Нептун дефинитивно се обидува да се опкружи со луѓе, бидејќи сака да има пријатели, а Кагоме е во голема мера негов тип? Како да е слатка и силна жена, а тој е всушност подобар пријател со жените отколку со мажите, зошто, тој само сака да биде опкружен со женски пријатели кои знаат. Сакам моите момци се супер добри пријатели и заштита на нивните девојки пријатели искрено. но ох М А Н јас сакам пседуо-семејни врски и Нептун е единствено дете, па тој не е имал такви, семејни врски како што е тоа. па неа се грижи за него сите постара сестра како ќе го направат да биде како ???? затоа што тој е збунет, но исто така тој всушност навистина го сака тоа LOL! и двете се добри деца, мислам дека тие ќе биде навистина забавно ^^<br/><br/>фандом оган амблем: судбини<br/><br/>Тинејџерки+18<br/><br/>видови Дел човечки / дел змеј<br/><br/>окупација претставник чувар<br/><br/>претпочита таа / таа<br/><br/>награди<br/><br/>yonder she / нејзиното aest 20 постови<br/><br/>Воопшто не сум ја видел Инујаша, но... од она што го прочитав, Кагоме изгледа дека е еден од оние луѓе кои би можеле да и помогнат на Корин со нејзината емоционална состојба. Има многу работи на ум, бидејќи таа мораше да се бори со нејзиното родно семејство против нејзината волја и последен пат кога ги виде, сите ја мразеа. Искрено, таа сеуште не работела низ сè, бидејќи во суштина беше на чело на целосна војна. Чувствувам дека тие би можеле да бидат пријатели бидејќи Корин е прилично отворена во нејзината личност, исто така исклучително доверлива. Таа само... се крие и се бори низ многу.

Ми се допаѓа твојата идеја Кагоме да ја слика Елса! Знаеш, таа е исто така пејачка/изведувачка во локален театар, па можам да замислам дека Кагоме оди таму да ги разгледува работите и потоа да ја фати Елса зад сцената или нешто друго - и тогаш пријателството може да процвета од таму! Апсолутно ја обожавам идејата за овие две квалитетни bff време заедно правејќи ги малите, но забавни работи што Елса никогаш не ги доживеала како дете.

| Why You Should be on Twitter<br/><br/>Disclaimer: I am not, nor have I ever claimed to be, a social media guru. I'm just a person who thinks about stuff a lot, and this has come up a number of times.<br/><br/>I'm not an early adopter. Sometimes it takes me years to figure out what I want to use something for before I actually get on it, and Twitter was one of those things. I've been on Twitter seriously since about February of this year, so I'm pretty new at it. Still, I've learned a number of things, and I wanted to share them. Some people say I'm a Twitter pusher, and I am, because there's lots of good reasons to get on it, and virtually no downsides.<br/><br/>So what's Twitter? If you're on the internet, you've probably at least heard of it. It's a social media network that serves as a forum for conversations, updates, and news in a medium more public than something like Facebook or LinkedIn. Facebook is about who wants to find you, but Twitter is about who you want to find. Your favourite writers, actors, politicians, singers, and scientists are probably on Twitter. So are your favourite charities, radio stations, news sites, and stores. And they want you to find them and listen to what they have to say. Everyone on Twitter, at least initially, wants to talk with you.<br/><br/>But why join that? Why be a part of it? There's all kinds of reasons, and I'm going to give you a few.<br/><br/>People and Places Twitter is a great way to find out about events which are going on around the world, but also in your community. If you're travelling and looking for things to do, it's a great way to find out about things relevant to your interests (because the people you follow are people you're interested in). Even if you're not travelling, knowing about great places to go locally or knowing that people you're interested in are going to them creates an opportunity to meet them and create a deeper relationship with them. If you go back to my party post, all the people in it but two, I heard about on Twitter and then met in real life, and now we're pretty good friends. And the more you do this, the more things you'll find out about, and the more people you'll meet. And if you follow them on Twitter, you already know a bit about what they're like. They want you to. The reverse is also true, because tweeting invites people to see what you're like, and they can make the same choices about you.<br/><br/>Inspiration and Motivation<br/>Inspiration comes from the strangest places, and the influx of tweets means there's always fresh content for your imagination. I have a follow first policy, so I'll follow just about anybody, and then periodically go through and unfollow people. I don't know who's going to plant the seed of a new blog post or new project in me, so I like to keep my options open. Motivation also happens, because Twitter is just like life. If you surround yourself with people who are ambitious, dedicated, generous, and hard-working, it's easier to be like that, and push yourself. It's easier to think that if they can plan events, launch projects, or just get up in the morning, well, so can you.<br/><br/>Learning and Lifestyle Bloggers are on Twitter. Bloggers who aren't may actually be crazy. And people blog about just about everything. If you're looking to learn something, odds are good that somebody's tweeting about it. On top of that, news services and stores are also connected, which means that you can get your news up to the minute, and find out about sales and deals as they start.As far as lifestyle, looking for new recipe ideas? Follow some caterers and see what they come up with. Need a twist for that cocktail party? Twitter's got people for that too. Wardrobe recommendations, or just want to see what other people are doing with their lives? It's all there.<br/><br/>There are some common challenges I face when talking about this, and they're legitimate obstacles. It can seem pretty daunting, especially if you're getting on the bandwagon late, like I did. I spent months following only two people and not knowing what else to do. But there are ways to overcome them, and hear they are from least frequent to most.<br/><br/>#3: Twitter is for Narcissistic Jerks<br/>I think this comes from the idea that most people tweet for and about themselves as a way of getting attention. What I don't get is why there's anything wrong with that, or why doing that makes one a narcissist or a jerk. If someone has something to say, they want to be heard. Used to be you'd stand on the street corner and yell. Now you can yell in 140 characters or less. Twitter's just a new way to be heard. Now, there are certainly narcissistic jerks on Twitter. They're pretty much everywhere. Sometimes, people are jerks. Sometimes one of those people is me, I'm sorry to say. Don't follow those people. If you don't like what someone is saying, whether that's points that they're making or detailed accounts of their bathroom activities, you don't have to listen on Twitter.<br/><br/>#2: I Can't Keep Track of It All<br/>The second obstacle people often bring up is that they just don't have time to keep track of all the things which are going on on Twitter. And you know what? That's fine. Keep track of what you can. Maybe you only wander on every few days. If you're a private user (rather than tweeting for your company), and especially a beginner, that's okay. Part of something is better than all of nothing.<br/><br/>#1 I've Got Nothing I Want to Put Out There<br/>This is by far the most frequent challenge people raise. And it doesn't even matter. You don't have to join Twitter to talk. Join it to listen. Again, your favourite authors, singers, bloggers, and newspapers are on here. This is your chance to listen to them. It's your chance to gain a window into their lives and activities, and they're inviting you to do that. Want to find out what Felicia Day is going to be up to at the San Diego Comic Con? Done. I know people who only listen on Twitter, and that's great. That's what I did for a while. Eventually, maybe you'll find something to tweet about, or make something to tweet about. I hope you do, because I want to hear about it.<br/><br/>In short, if you're not using Twitter, I think you should be. If you're not using it to its full extent, try to. Don't be afraid to follow five hundred people, if all of those people are saying things you're interested in. Invite those people into bits of your life, and see how it's improved by the interaction. I look forward to hearing from you. | Зошто треба да бидете на Твитер<br/><br/>Одрекување: Јас не сум, ниту некогаш сум тврдел дека сум, гуру на социјалните медиуми. Јас сум само личност која размислува за работите многу, и ова се појави неколку пати.<br/><br/>Јас не сум рано усвојувач. Понекогаш ми требаат години за да сфатам за што сакам да користам нешто пред да го добијам, а Твитер беше една од тие работи. Сериозно сум на Твитер од февруари оваа година, па сум прилично нов во тоа. Сепак, научив неколку работи, и сакав да ги споделам. Некои луѓе велат дека сум Твитер промотор, и јас сум, бидејќи има многу добри причини да се добие на тоа, и практично нема недостатоци.<br/><br/>Па што е Твитер? Ако сте на интернет, веројатно сте барем слушнале за него. Тоа е социјална мрежа која служи како форум за разговори, ажурирања и вести во медиум повеќе јавен отколку нешто како Фејсбук или LinkedIn. Фејсбук е за тоа кој сака да ве најде, но Твитер е за тоа кого сакате да најдете. Вашите омилени писатели, актери, политичари, пејачи и научници веројатно се на Твитер. Исто така, вашите омилени добротворни организации, радио станици, веб-страници со вести и продавници. И тие сакаат да ги најдете и да ги слушнете што имаат да кажат. Сите на Твитер, барем на почетокот, сакаат да разговараат со вас.<br/><br/>Но, зошто да се приклучите на тоа? Зошто да бидете дел од тоа? Постојат најразлични причини, и јас ќе ви дадам неколку.<br/><br/>Луѓе и места Твитер е одличен начин да дознаете за настаните што се случуваат низ целиот свет, но исто така и во вашата заедница. Ако патувате и барате работи кои треба да ги направите, тоа е одличен начин да дознаете за работи кои се релевантни за вашите интереси (бидејќи луѓето што ги следите се луѓе за кои сте заинтересирани). Дури и ако не патувате, знаејќи за одлични места за одење на локално ниво или знаејќи дека луѓето за кои сте заинтересирани ќе одат кај нив создава можност да се сретнат со нив и да се создаде подлабока врска со нив. Ако се вратите на мојот партиски пост, сите луѓе во него, освен двајца, слушнав за него на Твитер и потоа се сретнав во реалниот живот, и сега сме прилично добри пријатели. И колку повеќе го правите ова, толку повеќе работи ќе дознаете за, и толку повеќе луѓе ќе запознаете. И ако ги следите на Твитер, веќе знаете малку за тоа какви се тие. Тие сакаат да бидете. Спротивното е исто така точно, бидејќи твитот ги поканува луѓето да видат какви сте, и тие можат да ги направат истите избори за вас.<br/><br/>Инспирација и мотивација<br/>Инспирацијата доаѓа од најчудните места, а приливот на твитови значи дека секогаш има свежа содржина за вашата имагинација. Имам прва политика, па ќе ги следам сите, а потоа периодично ќе одам и ќе ги отфрлам луѓето. Не знам кој ќе го посади семето на нов блог пост или нов проект во мене, па сакам да ги задржам моите опции отворени. Мотивацијата исто така се случува, бидејќи Твитер е како животот. Ако се опкружувате со луѓе кои се амбициозни, посветени, великодушни и вредни, полесно е да бидете такви и да се туркате. Полесно е да се мисли дека ако тие можат да планираат настани, да започнат проекти, или само да станат наутро, па, можете и вие.<br/><br/>Учење и начин на живот блогери се на Твитер. Блогерите кои не се всушност може да биде луд. И луѓето блог за речиси сè. Ако барате да научите нешто, шансите се добри дека некој твитува за тоа.

Препораки за гардероба или само сакате да видите што другите луѓе прават со своите животи? Сето тоа е таму.<br/><br/>Постојат некои заеднички предизвици со кои се соочувам кога зборувам за ова, и тие се легитимни пречки. Тоа може да изгледа прилично застрашувачки, особено ако сте се на бенд вагон доцна, како што направив. Поминав месеци следејќи само двајца луѓе и не знаејќи што друго да правам. Но, постојат начини да ги надминеме, и да ги слушнеме од најмалку чести до најмногу.<br/><br/>#3: Твитер е за нарцистични кретени<br/>Мислам дека ова доаѓа од идејата дека повеќето луѓе твит за и за себе како начин да се добие внимание. Она што не го сфаќам е зошто има нешто погрешно во тоа, или зошто тоа го прави еден нарцис или кретен. Ако некој има нешто да каже, тие сакаат да бидат слушнати. Порано ќе застанете на аголот на улицата и ќе викате. Сега можете да викате во 140 карактери или помалку. Твитер е само нов начин да се слушне. Сега, сигурно има нарцисоидни кретени на Твитер. Тие се насекаде. Понекогаш луѓето се кретени. Понекогаш еден од тие луѓе сум јас, жал ми е што морам да кажам. Не ги следи тие луѓе. Ако не ви се допаѓа она што некој го кажува, без разлика дали тоа се поени кои тие ги прават или детални извештаи за нивните активности во бањата, не мора да слушате на Твитер.<br/><br/>#2 Не можам да го следам сето тоа<br/>Втората пречка што луѓето често ја спомнуваат е дека тие едноставно немаат време да ги следат сите работи што се случуваат на Твитер. И знаете што? Тоа е во ред. Следете што можете. Можеби само лутате на секои неколку дена. Ако сте приватен корисник (наместо твитање за вашата компанија), а особено почетник, тоа е во ред. Дел од нешто е подобро од ништо.<br/><br/># 1 Немам ништо што сакам да го ставам таму.<br/>Ова е далеку најчестиот предизвик што луѓето го предизвикуваат. И тоа дури и не е важно. Не мора да се приклучите на Твитер за да разговарате. Приклучете се за да слушате. Повторно, вашите омилени автори, пејачи, блогери и весници се тука. Ова е вашата шанса да ги слушате. Тоа е вашата шанса да се добие прозорец во нивните животи и активности, и тие се поканети да го направите тоа. Сакате да дознаете што Felicia ден ќе биде до во Сан Диего Comic Con? Готово. Знам луѓе кои само слушаат на Твитер, и тоа е одлично. Тоа е она што го направив за некое време. На крајот, можеби ќе најдете нешто да твитнете за, или да направите нешто да твитнете за. Се надевам дека го правите, бидејќи сакам да слушнам за тоа.<br/><br/>Накратко, ако не го користите Твитер, мислам дека треба да бидете. Ако не го користите во целост, обидете се. Не плашете се да следите петстотини луѓе, ако сите тие луѓе велат работи за кои сте заинтересирани. Поканете ги овие луѓе во делови од вашиот живот, и видете како тоа се подобрува од интеракцијата. Со нетрпение очекувам да се слушне од вас. |
| Root Canals<br/><br/>The very thought of getting a root canal puts most people on edge. SCM Dental utilizes the latest technology and technique to make a root canal a virtually pain free and low stress procedure.<br/><br/>Rotary endodontics is an advanced technology and technique to perform endodontic treatment, the clinical term for a root canalThe term "root canal" refers to the natural cavity at the center of the tooth. The tooth's nerve is located in soft tissue (pulp) inside the root canal. If the tooth is damaged either by trauma or decay, debris can enter the sensitive root canal area and cause an infection, or in extreme circumstances, and abscess. An abscessed tooth is very serious and should be treated as an emergency, as it can create an infection that may spread to other parts of the body. If you believe you have an abscessed tooth, contact our office immediately to schedule emergency care.<br/><br/>Depending on the case, root canal therapy may require more than one visit. An initial x-ray will be taken to evaluate the tooth and root canal and determine the extent of the damage and infection if present. You will be given a form of anesthesia to make you relaxed.<br/><br/>When the area is numb, our dentist will create an access chamber to the root canal using an electric handpiece. Next, the root canal will be scraped of the infected or damaged tissue and nerve. Once the entire area has been throughly cleaned and polished, the tooth will be filled with a biocompatible rubber compound called gutta percha. The tooth is then covered with a dental filling or dental crown to restore strength and function.<br/><br/>Endodontic therapy has a bad reputation as being a painful procedure. With rotary endodontics, a root canal procedure is no more painful than having a dental filling placed. The infection and damage to the nerve is what creates the extreme pain and discomfort and patients you will experience significant relief after undergoing root canal therapy. Root canals have a success rate of 95% and allow people to preserve their natural teeth. | Коренот канали<br/><br/>Самата мисла за добивање на коренски канал ги става повеќето луѓе на работ. SCM Dental ја користи најновата технологија и техника за да го направи коренскиот канал практично безболен и со низок стрес.<br/><br/>Ротационата ендодонција е напредна технологија и техника за вршење на ендодонтски третман, клинички термин за коренски канал. Нервот на забот се наоѓа во мекото ткиво (пулпа) внатре во коренскиот канал. Ако забот е оштетен или од траума или распаѓање, остатоците можат да влезат во чувствителната област на коренскиот канал и да предизвикаат инфекција или во екстремни околности и апсцес. Апсцесираниот заб е многу сериозен и треба да се третира како итен случај, бидејќи може да создаде инфекција која може да се прошири на други делови од телото. Ако верувате дека имате апсцесиран заб, веднаш контактирајте ја нашата канцеларија за да закажете итна нега.<br/><br/>Во зависност од случајот, терапијата на коренскиот канал може да бара повеќе од една посета. Ќе се земе почетна рендгенска снимка за да се процени забот и коренскиот канал и да се утврди степенот на оштетување и инфекција ако е присутен. Ќе ви биде дадена форма на анестезија за да се опуштите.<br/><br/>Кога областа е вкочанета, нашиот стоматолог ќе создаде комора за пристап до коренскиот канал со користење на електричен ракав. Потоа, коренскиот канал ќе биде изгребан од заразеното или оштетеното ткиво и нерв. Откако целата област е прочистена и полирана, забот ќе биде исполнет со биокомпатибилна гумена состојка наречена гута перча. Забот потоа е покриен со забно полнење или забна круна за да се врати силата и функцијата.<br/><br/>Ендодонтската терапија има лоша репутација како болна процедура. Со ротирачка ендодонтија, постапката на коренскиот канал не е поболна од поставувањето на забен полнеж. Инфекцијата и оштетувањето на нервот е она што создава екстремна болка и непријатност и пациентите ќе доживеат значително олеснување по терапијата со коренови канали. Коренските канали имаат стапка на успех од 95% и им овозможуваат на луѓето да ги зачуваат своите природни заби. |
| Churchyard Bottom Wood<br/><br/>Highgate<br/><br/>Churchyard Bottom Wood, Highgate<br/><br/>Now called Queen's Wood<br/><br/>Between 1860 and 1880 the centre was torn out of the City of London to build sewers, railways and new roads. Houses were demolished without regard for the tenants who had to find whatever accommodation they could elsewhere. Managers went to livo in Kensington and St. John's Wood, while the poorest crowded into the rookeries like Seven Dials and Lisson Grove. For those between, the clerks and skilled workmen, speculative builders put up row after row of terraced villas and Mr Pooter moved into Holloway. The people of Muswell Hill watched houses creep across the fields of Finsbury Park, up Crouch Hill and down the other side, so that by 1880, Crouch End was being developed and there seemed no way to stem the flow. Ten years later the large estates of Muswell Hill were being sold. Upton Farm was sold and the Ecclesiastical Commissioners wanted to develop Churchyard Bottom Wood, now called Queen's Wood. The story would have made an Ibsen play. Two groups of honest, highly motivated people fighting for what they each thought was right. The Ecclesiastical Commissioners on the one hand and the Committee of the Hornsey Charities on the other, both believed they were doing their best for other people, and the public rose against them both in indignation<br/><br/>At that time Muswell Hill Road was a country road, with Southwood Hall at one end and Upton Farm at the other. By 1894, Onslow Gardens was built, Connaught Gardens marked out, and builders were poised to develop the Woodlands estate. Cut out of Churchyard Bottom Wood was a group of tumble-down cottages, on a triangular site. An undated map, held by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners shows six Wasteland Cottages with an opening between them - not a road, not metalled, but a way through to the strawberry beds behind. Further along was another gap which led to footpaths through the wood. These two openings were to be the basis of the plan. The same two gaps and the cleared ground, which was the strawberry field, can be seen in the 1894 map below. They are shown as 'Muswell Hill Cottages' and, quite in passing, Peter Sellers was to live on the same site much later on. To develop the wood as a housing estate, the Commissioners needed to drive two roads through from Muswell Hill Road and build houses along them. The Muswell Hill Road frontage alone would not have provided room for enough houses to make the venture worthwhile.<br/><br/>The land and cottages had been given much earlier as almshouses to house old people and were held on their behalf by the Trustees of the Hornsey Charity Commissioners. By the 1890s the cottages were tumble-down, in need of major repair. Public-spirited, wishing to do the best for their old tenants, the Trustees could not improve them since they had no money. Some years before the Ecclesiastical Commissioners had planned to develop Gravel Pit Wood (now Highgate Wood) as a housing estate, but this had met such opposition that they backed down. Instead, in 1886, they gave all 69 acres woodland to the public. At the same time they offered to sell Churchyard Bottom Wood to Hornsey Urban District Council for £25,000, but this was too much for Hornsey to raise on its own. The Council said that people living outside Hornsey also enjoyed the wood and other authorities should help, but no help was given. In the end the offer fell into abeyance.<br/><br/>Map showing the Muswell Hill Cottages which were the centre of the controversy.<br/><br/>Muswell Hill Road about 1880<br/><br/>It seems probable that these three pairs of cottages<br/>were the ones at the centre of the dispute.<br/><br/>The Ecclesiastical Commissioners wanted to raise money for its church work in Britain and abroad. They considered that they had been given the land to be used for the propogat­ion of religion and if this meant selling off land or woods, it was a lesser evil than restricting the work of the church. They had given Gravel Pit Wood to the public: in its place they would develop Churchyard Bottom Wood.<br/><br/>The Trustees of the Hornsey Charities wanted to produce an income to help their poor people, so they made an offer to the Commissioners. Their triangular piece of land was too awkwardly shaped to be developed economically, but if the Commissioners would grant them some more land to make it into a square site, they would build twenty-five neat villas. These would bring in ground rents of £225 per annum, which could be used to relieve the poverty of Hornsey people. In return they would permit the Commission­ers to cut two roads through their land so that the Commissioners could develop the woods.<br/><br/>When this offer became known people immediately reacted with alarm.<br/><br/>On the 16th December 1893 Mr Carvell Williams MP asked in the House of Commons, if the Ecclesiastical Commissioners had consented to sell a strip of land to the Hornsey Charities Trustees on condition that an existing road be widened to 40 feet, whether this was a preliminary to a building scheme and if the House of Parliament would have an opportunity to express an opinion.<br/><br/>Mr Leveson Gower, a Church Estates Commissioner replied',"Yes" to the first part.<br/><br/>Mr Carvell Williams, "Do I understand it is the intention to destroy that portion of Highgate Woods by building on it?"<br/><br/>Two days later The Star published an article worthy of any modern tabloid.<br/><br/>The Star<br/>18th December 1893<br/><br/>'Parliament must keep a keen watch on those old vandals and confederates of the jerry-builder the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. They are always alienating some piece of land or are favouring the builders as opposed to the general public. The Commissioners would not sell the Churchyard Bottom wood to the ratepayers but now propose 'to open it up' by cutting two wide roads through it in connection with one of their numerous building schemes. Will not someone ask a question in Parliament and check the brick and mortar policy of the Commissioners?'<br/><br/>By the time this was printed, the question had been asked and the answer was either untrue, or devious. Other papers took up the story. The Times, in a long report, said that the Comnussioners were not prepared to give an undertaking that Parliament, or any other public body, should have an opportunity of considering any scheme for building on the site of the wood.<br/><br/>The situation simmered for eighteen months until the Ecclesiastical Commissioners were forced to open an enquiry, which began at Highgate on 31 May 1895, chaired by an Assistant Ecclesiastical Commissioner. The Inquiry produced a flurry of newspaper letters of which this was the most important.<br/><br/>The Daily Chronicle, 5 June 1895<br/><br/>VANDALISM AT HIGHGATE<br/><br/>Sir –<br/><br/>One of the most lovely bits of woodland in suburan London is threatened. Will you help us to ward off what would be a calamity, not only to the immediate district, but to the whole of densely-populated North London? In no part of the metropolis has the builder been more active than in Crouch End and Hornsey. The beautiful meadows of a year or two ago are now houses and shops. Ballast heaps have taken the place of stately elms and chestnuts, and once pleasant villages are sharing the fate of Stroud Green, Harringay, Finsbury Park, Highbury and Islington. ---<br/><br/>---- The object is the construction of two forty-foot roads through the woods. We in this district know the meaning of forty-foot roads through woods. It means that the woods are doomed. Ten years ago agitation saved the sister-wood of sixty-five acres - The Gravel Pit Woods - and no one who saw the Bank Holiday crowds flocking up the Archway Road from the dreary streets of Holloway, Islington and Clerkenwell, and watched the keen enjoyment of the children and family parties picnicking on the grass and among the trees, could fail to realise the immense boon that the grant by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners of this wood has been to the whole of North London, but the Lower Wood of sixty acres has always been regarded as a natural complement of the other. ----<br/><br/>--- The Ecclesiastical Commissioners own nearly one-third of the large parish of Hornsey. By the liberal expenditure of the ratepayers' money in the opening up of roads and the general development of the district, the value of their property has been enormously increased, and from this unearned increment they each year draw large revenues. Surely the ratepayers whose money has thus aided in creating the immense estate may expect liberal treatment in return. ---<br/><br/>Yours obediently,<br/><br/>Signed by The Vicar of St James', Muswell Hill, the Minister of Park Chapel, Crouch End, a barrister living in Onslow Gardens and three members of the District Council.<br/><br/>It was a shot right across the bows of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. Their own religious leaders and the District Council, all up in arms saying in effect that the church was too rich and should be charitable, not greedy. The inclusion of the two clergymen was a shrewd move. Remember to that this was still in the height of the Darwin controversy. Darwin had split belief in the teachings of the Church and many people would have resented the power of the Church from that point of view alone. The Church was not so secure as it pretended to be.<br/><br/>The Evening News, 7 June 1895 said:-<br/><br/>"If the Ecclesiastical Comnussioners are not tackled at once, the building octopus will get a grip of the wood which will be very difficult to loosen later on, ---. Therefore it behoves Londoners to be up and doing if they would save one of their most delightful bits of rustic scenery. The public inquiry stands adjourned to Thursday next, and before then something must be done to convince the Commissioners that the citizens of London will not tolerate the confiscation of one of their favourite playgrounds."<br/><br/>A letter in the Daily Chronicle the next day said:-<br/><br/>.... It was with great relief that that the residents, some ten years ago, heard that the purchase of the Upper Wood had been effected; and how delightful a boon this has proved, anyone who visited them can testify, but all who exerted themselves to save these upper woods, which lie on the west side of Muswell Hill road, felt that their victory was incomplete so long as the sixty acres on the east side remained in danger. It is, as it were, an accident that the woods are divided by a broad high road. Can anyone doubt what the effect would be if the Churchyard Bottom Wood were replaced by rows of small villas, each sending out its contribution of smoke and soot? Can anyone doubt, too, the serious difference it would make to the picturesque setting of the purchased woods if a line of staring new houses were to be run up right over against their leafy frontage?'<br/><br/>This expressed the opinions of many people. In fact, the Gravel Pit Wood, which the writer calls the 'Upper Wood', had not been purchased, but given to the district by the Ecclesiastical Commission, a point they were to reiterate time and again over the years, but most people ignored it. The Commission was not going to give away a second wood whatever anyone said, and held this position to the end.<br/><br/>H.S.Chamberlain, of 5 Cranley Gardens,<br/>in a letter to the Times dated June 8, 1895, urged purchase.<br/><br/>I know that it is common to speak harshly of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, but as the trustees of a fund they are bound to administer it to the greatest advantage, and therefore, if anything is to be done to save the demolition of the wood, it appears to me that it can only be effected by the purchase of the property from the Comnussioners, who I know, are fully alive to the protection of free and open spaces for the people, and who, I feel sure, would be disposed to treat the matter of a purchase in a free and liberal spirit, as they have already done in the matter of the Shepherd's Cot-field, by granting a lease to the Crouch End Playing-fields Company - a small company in which I own a few shares, a small company which was formed exclusively for the purpose of securing the fields for cricket, tennis etc.<br/><br/>(This refers the the Crouch End Playing Fields which had been secured a few years later.)<br/><br/>As Chairman of the Muswell Hill Conservative Association, I am constantly in touch with the inhabitants, and I can safely affirm that every person resident in the neighbourhood would do anything in reason to preserve.<br/><br/>(All he wanted personally was Charity income to support his poor people. He demanded his acre of land - not a great deal surely - he believed the Commissioners' assurance that the wood was not in danger.)<br/><br/>' Muswell Hill Road was one of the best in Hornsey and would remain equally beautiful, houses or no houses',<br/><br/>(and then came the great rhetorical flourish.)<br/><br/>'Are the poor to suffer because of the sentimental objections and the hysterical cry of 'wolf just raised by your correspondents? Something must be done and that soon. An acre of back-land added to the charity-estate would make no apprec­iable difference to the land remaining, while the profit derived from it would succour many poor old and deserving persons in their declining years and enable us to hand over to our successors an estate which in the distant future would be of great value in the rendering of charitable aid to the deserving poor of the parish of Hornsey.'<br/><br/>Reading his letter one senses hysteria very near the surface. Why did he think the Commissioners wanted to build a road? Why should they spend all that money if not to build houses? He never seemed to realise that for an acre of land the the whole wood would be lost. But he had been with the problem for a long time. He was the person to whom the Commissioners had made the offer of sale for £25,000 years before and it is his name which is honoured in a plaque on Crouch End Clock Tower for saving the wood, but his trust in the Ecclesiastical Commissioners seems naive. It is sad that at the Inquiry he was to be cast as the devil.<br/><br/>The Inquiry Continued<br/><br/>The adjourned opened in Highgate on 15 June 1895. Expecting a large gather­ing, the Council Chamber had been changed completely. The usual tables had been removed and the room filled with chairs. By half past seven the room was crowded, with people jostling for seats.<br/><br/>Mr Murray, the Commissioner, said the Inquiry was really a simple one. Hornsey Parochial Charities wished to purchase a piece of land adjoining their charity property at the back. The question was whether the Charity Commission, which controlled all charities, had enough power to stop them. The Church Commissioners were prepared to sell the land at very favourable terms and the income of the Charity would be very considerable increased.<br/><br/>Against this there were three classes of objection.<br/><br/>The original Trust was for the purpose of providing cottages for the Poor, but the trustees were proposing to build villas which would be too expensive for the Poor. However, it was within the power of the Trustees to vary the terms of the Trust, so they could build villas if they thought that the Poor would benefit in the end. The poor people themselves might object, but liberal provisions had already been promised for them. The third objection related to the aesthetic and public side of the question. He took it from what he had read that the Charity Commission ought to interfere to prevent the Ecclesiastical Commissioners from exercising their own discretion in dealing with their own property.<br/><br/>The Inquiry discussed fine points, but the speakers kept coming back to the major problem of preventing any destruction of the wood. The Vestry Clerk of Islington, representing 300,000 people, made a formal protest about any part of the wood, so valuable for the people of Islington and Hornsey being used for private purposes. Mr Wilfred White said that if the Commissioners would give them time they would be able to raise the money to compensate the Trustees.<br/><br/>Mr Beaumont said they did not want villas, they wanted cottages for poor people who were being driven out of the district. Others said that there was no money to build cottages to replace the present delapidated ones but villas would be an economic proposition. Others retorted that there were score of villas to let in Highgate. The Wood was sacred. Stick to the question of the Wood.<br/><br/>Dr Fletcher said the cry among the working people was that there was nowhere to go. Working people came to him with the cry, "We are driven out of Highgate and are obliged to go to Highgate New Town." If the Muswell Hill Road frontage was sold there was no question but that roads might be cut right through the woods in the direction of Hornsey, but if the Commissioners could not get the land from the Charity Commission they could not cut the road.<br/><br/>He was very sure the cottages could be put into a fit state of repair. He was asked by the poor people, by the police and by a number of the working classes to represent these two points, that cottage accommodation was very sorely needed in Highgate and that if they once allowed the land to be sold, there was no telling where the hand of the builder would be stayed.<br/><br/>(Loud and prolonged cheers).<br/><br/>Numerous other people spoke and the Comnussioner summed up by saying that he took it that the prevailing opinion was in favour of retaining the cottages but the meeting should draw no conclusions from what he had said (Groans).<br/><br/>Others said that the Trustees of the Charity had failed in their duties by letting the the cottages fall into disrepair.<br/><br/>Mr H.R.Williams, the Trustee who had written to the paper earlier, said that he had it on the best authority that the Church Commissioners would make no roads whatever and they would not be benefitted one iota by the actions of the Charity Commissioners. Others were far less trusting and the meeting closed after nearly three hours.<br/><br/>'We are faced with the fact that in Highgate and Muswell Hill there are a number of persons who want the Churchyard Bottom Wood and will not be happy until they have got it - while nobody appears willing to spend a farthing to pay for it. Everyone says it would be a fine thing to have the wood as open space, but everybody thinks it is the duty of someone else to make it one. The Islington Vestry has 'resolved' on the subject, but the Islington Vestry does not offer a penny piece towards the purchase. --- There is no more difficult problem for the community or the individual to solve than how to gain possession of other people's property without paying for it.'<br/><br/>Paying for it was indeed the problem as Churchyard Bottom Wood became the subject of intense local and national debate. A joint committee was formed to raise money to save the wood. On 20 November 1896, C.F.Cory-Wright, Hon Treasurer, wrote to The Standard, a daily paper at that time, appealing for help. He reminded everyone of the danger of losing the wood and said it could only be saved by buying it. The Church Commissioners would sell for £25,000 and an extra (5,000 would be required for fencing and drainage, making a total of £30,000. This was too much for Hornsey Council to raise but they had already voted £10,000 towards the total. The woods were of inestimable value to all of North London so he appealed to public bodies and private people to raise the remaining £20,000. He warned that the present offer from the Church Commissioners was open only to the end of 1898. After that the builders would move in.<br/><br/>The appeal was warmly welcomed by the press. A Private Bill was rushed through Parliament and the Highgate Woods Preservation Act, 1897, became law. The Conunittee now had the right to advertise for contributions towards buying the Wood and preserving it.<br/><br/>In a fairly short time almost all the money was raised, but the last few thousand proved very difficult to raise and the Commissioners' deadline was a matter of weeks away. Mr Cory-Wright wrote pleading for more time but was granted a mere three months and then only if interest at 4 per cent was paid for the extra period on the full sum. In the end the London County Council, which had originally offered £2,500, made this up to £5,000 and the total was reached, but it was a close-run thing.<br/><br/>The Council decided to re-name the Wood as 'Queen's Woods' in honour of Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee and Hornsey put on a fine display of bunting when the Duchess of Albany formally declared the Wood open 'for the free use of the public for ever'.<br/><br/>While the campaign to save Churchyard Bottom Wood was run and directed by local people who felt passionately about this particular piece of woodland, they called on the help and experience of a vast network of people, some of whom had worked together on similar campaigns for over thirty years. The Committee issued an appeal, printed on very good quality paper and bearing some famous names.<br/><br/>The questions of open space and public health were major subjects of the Victorian vision.<br/><br/>The Open Spaces Movement<br/><br/>Octavia Hill, the great housing reformer, who had begun with three old houses in Marylebone, bought for her by Jolm Ruskin, had quickly become an expert on housing poor people in the healthiest conditions possible. Her way was to buy leases and then knock down some of the crowded houses in order to bring light and air to the rest, believing that fresh air and sunlight were the the only way poor people could be saved from 'putrid fever. She had learnt this as a child from her grandfather, Southwood Smith, who developed his theories at the Fever Hospital at King's Cross.<br/><br/>He had built the first Industrial Dwellings for poor people and had proved statistically that good air and decent drainage saved lives. Gibson Gardens, in Northwold Road, is a direct outcome of Southwood Smith's ideas. More Information on Gibson Gardens<br/><br/>The Importance of Open Air<br/><br/>Open spaces and the opportunity to breathe clean air, were essential for people living in one or two crowded rooms. Octavia Hill took her charges from the Lisson Grove slums, up Fitzjohn's Avenue to Hampstead Heath. She so loved the Fitzjohn's Avenue fields that she tried to buy them as a public park. They were to cost £10,000 and within three August weeks £8,500 had been raised. It needed only the end of the summer holidays and the return from holiday of sympathetic friends and the further £1,500 would have been raised, but the owners suddenly withdrew their offer. Despite all pleading, the fields were covered with large houses.<br/><br/>From this developed the campaign to save Parliament Hill, the next open space northwards from Lisson Grove, buying up fields in the path of the builders to make a permanent cordon sanitalre against the advancing bricks. The Parliament Hill Fields campaign was so successful that the Hampstead Heath Bill was passed and there was money over from the appeal. From this money and the impetus towards open spaces, was to develop the National Trust. Octavia Hill had been interested in protecting areas like Church Bottom Wood for years, so she was a natural ally in the fight to save the Wood.<br/><br/>The Commons Preservation Society also, was familiar with this kind of agitation and money collection. They had torn down fencing when lords of the manor had enclosed pieces of common land, leading both legal and illegal battles against the arrogant privatization of land traditionally free. Robert Hunter, their Honorary Solicitor from 1868, was always concerned with securing open spaces, large or small, for the public. He, now Sir Robert Hunter, became the Chairman of the Church Bottom Appeal. The Chairman of the Commons Preservation Society was Mr Shaw-Lefevre MP (later Lord Eversley) who played a big part in this and other campaigns in the House of Commons. Octavia Hill had been involved in their work from about 1875.<br/><br/>At the same time Octavia Hill was campaigning for a Burials Bill.<br/><br/>City churchyards had become so full and such a serious a hazard to health, by contaminating wells from which people drew their drinking water, that City burials were no longer permitted. Instead, cemetries were created on the outskirts of town. Abney Park Cemetary was one of these. There was then a movement to remove the headstones to the edges of the old town cemetries, re-inter the bodies elsewhere and turn the cemetries into gardens and open spaces, instead of building on them. This land in the centre of London was very valuable and speculators were avid to obtain it: Even the Quakers had built over one of their cemetries and threatened to do so again by building over Bunhill Fields. Octavia Hill had a network of allies in a dozen fields, so her help to save the Church Bottom Wood must have been invaluable.<br/><br/>The Metropolitan Gardens Society, set up in 1882, had laid out about two hundred small gardens in city centres by 1890. They later handed them over to the Local Authorities, so their support for the Churchyard Bottom Wood Appeal was assured from the start.<br/><br/>The Kyrle Society is forgotten now, but in its day had great influence on Town Planning and Open Space legislation. The Society had been set up about 1875 for 'the Diffusion of Beauty', to bring colour and interest into the lives of people living in dull, drab surroundings. Bright colour to walls and decoration, good singing, open spaces, Nature, Literature and Art. All these fell within the Society's remit. There was a Decorative Branch, for whom William Morris lectured; a Musical Branch to promote choirs and Happy Evenings for people in local school buildings; and a Literature Branch. The Society appealed regularly by letters in The Times, to 'the richer classes' for books and periodicals to be distributed to boys' and girls' clubs, almshouses and elsewhere. However the Open Spaces Committee was the most active. The very name 'Kyrle' came from Pope's The Man of Ross, the philanthropist who gave his birthplace to the people as a public park. | Churchyard Дното дрво<br/><br/>Хајгејт<br/><br/>Churchyard Bottom Wood, Хајгејт<br/><br/>Сега се вика Кралицата на дрвото<br/><br/>Помеѓу 1860 и 1880 центарот бил искинат од Сити во Лондон за да се изградат канализација, железници и нови патишта. Куќите биле урнати без оглед на станарите кои морале да најдат сместување што можеле на друго место. Менаџерите отидоа да живеат во Кенсингтон и Сент Џонс Вуд, додека најсиромашните се гужваа во куќите како Севен Диалс и Лисон Гроув. За оние меѓу нив, службениците и квалификуваните работници, шпекулативни градители поставиле ред по ред терасирани вили и г-дин Путер се преселил во Холовеј. Луѓето од Масвел Хил гледале како куќите се движат низ полињата на Финсбери Парк, нагоре по Крауч Хил и надолу по другата страна, така што до 1880 година Крауч Енд бил развиен и се чинело дека нема начин да се запре протокот. Десет години подоцна, големите имоти на Мусвел Хил биле продадени. Фармата Аптон била продадена и црковните комесари сакале да ја развијат Churchyard Bottom Wood, сега наречена Queen's Wood. Приказната би направила претстава на Ибсен. Две групи на искрени, високо мотивирани луѓе се борат за она што мислат дека е во право. Црковните комесари, од една страна, и Комитетот на добротворните организации на Хорнси, од друга страна, и двајцата верувале дека го прават најдоброто за другите луѓе, а јавноста се кренала против нив.<br/><br/>Во тоа време, Muswell Hill Road беше селски пат, со Southwood Hall на еден крај и Upton Farm на другиот. До 1894, Onslow Gardens беше изграден, Connaught Gardens означени, и градители беа подготвени да го развијат имотот Woodlands. Исечена од Churchyard Bottom Wood беше група на колиби, на триаголна локација. Недатирана мапа, која ја држат црковните комесари, покажува шест колиби со отвор меѓу нив - не пат, не метализиран, туку пат до креветите со јагоди зад нив. Понатаму заедно беше уште една празнина која доведе до пешачки патеки низ дрвото. Овие две отвори требаше да биде основа на планот. Истите две празнини и исчистен терен, кој беше полето на јагода, може да се види на картата 1894 подолу. Тие се прикажани како "Muswell Hill Cottages" и, патем, Питер Селерс требаше да живее на истата локација многу подоцна. За да се развие дрвото како станбена населба, комесарите требаше да возат два патишта од Muswell Hill Road и да градат куќи по нив. Самата фасада на Мусвел Хил Роуд не би обезбедила доволно простор за куќи за да се исплати вложувањето.<br/><br/>Земјиштето и куќите биле дадени многу порано како милосрдни домови за сместување на стари луѓе и биле одржувани во нивно име од страна на доверителите на добротворните комесари на Хорнси. До 1890-тите куќите биле урнати, на кои им била потребна голема поправка. Јавно настроени, сакајќи да го направат најдоброто за своите стари станари, Доверителите не можеле да ги подобрат бидејќи немале пари. Неколку години пред тоа, црковните комесари планирале да ја развијат Гравјанската јама (сега Хајгејт Вуд) како станбен комплекс, но ова се сретнало со такво противење што тие се откажале. Наместо тоа, во 1886 година, тие ги дале сите 69 хектари шума на јавноста. Во исто време, тие понудиле да го продадат Churchyard Bottom Wood на Градскиот совет на Хорнси за 25.000 фунти, но тоа било премногу за Хорнси да го собере самостојно. Советот рече дека луѓето кои живеат надвор од Хорнси, исто така, уживаа во дрвото и другите власти треба да помогнат, но не беше дадена помош. На крајот понудата падна во застој.<br/><br/>Мапата ги покажува Muswell Hill Cottages кои биле центар на контроверзијата.<br/><br/>Масвел Хил Роуд околу 1880<br/><br/>Се чини веројатно дека овие три парови колиби биле во центарот на спорот.<br/><br/>Црковните комесари сакале да соберат пари за својата црковна работа во Британија и во странство. Тие сметале дека земјата им била дадена за да се користи за пропозициски јон на религијата и ако тоа значело продажба на земја или шума, тоа било помало зло отколку ограничување на работата на црквата. Тие му дале на јавноста дрво од Гравјанска јама: на негово место тие ќе развијат црковно двориште од дното на дрвото.<br/><br/>Доверителите на добротворните организации на Хорнси сакале да произведат приход за да им помогнат на своите сиромашни луѓе, па им дале понуда на комесарите. Нивното триаголно парче земја било премногу незгодно обликувано за да се развие економски, но ако комесарите им дадат повеќе земја за да го направат квадратно место, тие ќе изградат дваесет и пет убави вили. Овие ќе донесат земјени кирии од £ 225 годишно, кои би можеле да се искористат за ублажување на сиромаштијата на Хорнси луѓето. За возврат, тие ќе и овозможат на Комисијата да се намали два патишта низ нивната земја, така што комесарите би можеле да ги развијат шумите.<br/><br/>Кога оваа понуда стана позната, луѓето веднаш реагираа со аларм.<br/><br/>На 16 декември 1893 година, пратеникот Карвел Вилијамс прашал во Долниот дом, дали црковните комесари се согласиле да продадат дел од земјиштето на доверителите на добротворните организации под услов постоечкиот пат да биде проширен на 40 стапки, дали ова е прелиминарен план за изградба и дали Домот на парламентот ќе има можност да изрази мислење.<br/><br/>Г-дин Левесон Говер, комесар за црковни имоти, одговори со „Да“ на првиот дел.<br/><br/>Г-дин Карвел Вилијамс, "Дали разбирам дека има намера да го уништи тој дел од Хајгејт Вудс со градење на него?"<br/><br/>Два дена подоцна, The Star објави статија достојна за секој модерен таблоид.<br/><br/>Ѕвездата<br/>18 декември 1893<br/><br/>"Парламентот мора внимателно да внимава на тие стари вандали и сојузници на градителот на џери, црковните комесари. Тие секогаш отуѓуваат некое парче земја или ги фаворизираат градителите наспроти општата јавност. Комесарите не сакаа да го продадат дрвото од долниот дел на црквата на платениците на стапката, но сега предлагаат „да се отвори“ со сечење на два широки патишта низ него во врска со една од нивните бројни градежни шеми. Зарем некој нема да постави прашање во парламентот и да ја провери политиката на комесарите за тули и малтери?<br/><br/>До моментот кога ова беше отпечатено, прашањето беше поставено и одговорот беше или неточен или лукав. Тајмс, во еден долг извештај, рече дека Комунисерите не се подготвени да дадат обврска дека Парламентот, или кое било друго јавно тело, треба да имаат можност да размислат за било каква шема за изградба на местото на дрвото.<br/><br/>Ситуацијата вриела осумнаесет месеци додека црковните комесари не биле принудени да отворат истрага, која започнала во Хајгејт на 31 мај 1895 година, предводена од помошник црковен комесар. Истрагата произвела врева од весници од кои ова било најважното.<br/><br/>The Daily Chronicle, 5 јуни 1895<br/><br/>ВАНДАЛИЗАМ НА ВИСОКА СТРАНА<br/><br/>Г-дине...<br/><br/>Ќе ни помогнете ли да избегнеме катастрофа, не само за непосредната област, туку и за целиот густо населен Северен Лондон? Во ниту еден дел од метрополата градителот не бил поактивен отколку во Крауч Енд и Хорнси. Прекрасните ливади од пред една или две години сега се куќи и продавници. Баласт купови го зазедоа местото на величествени брестови и костен, а некогаш пријатни села ја делат судбината на Страуд Грин, Харингеј, Финсбери Парк, Хајбери и Ислингтон. ---<br/><br/>---- Објектот е изградба на две четириесет стапки патишта низ шумата. Ние во овој округ го знаеме значењето на четириесет стапки патишта низ шумата. Тоа значи дека шумата е осудена. Пред десет години агитацијата го спасила сестринското дрво од шеесет и пет хектари - Шљунковитата шума - и никој кој видел како толпата на банките за одмор се собираат на Archway Road од мрачните улици на Холовеј, Ислингтон и Клеркенвел, и го гледал острото уживање на децата и семејните забави кои пикнуваат на тревата и меѓу дрвките, не можел да го сфати северниот шумар. ----<br/><br/>Црковните комесари поседуваат речиси една третина од големата парохија Хорнси. Со либералното трошење на парите на плаќачите на стапките за отворањето на патиштата и општиот развој на округот, вредноста на нивниот имот е енормно зголемена, и од ова незаработено зголемување тие секоја година црпат големи приходи. Секако, платениците на стапката чии пари на тој начин помогнале во создавањето на огромниот имот можат да очекуваат либерален третман за возврат.<br/><br/>Твојата послушност,<br/><br/>Потпишано од Викарот на Сент Џејмс, Масвел Хил, министерот за парк капела, Крауч Енд, адвокат кој живее во Онслоу Гарденс и три членови на окружниот совет.<br/><br/>Нивните верски водачи и Окружниот совет, сите со оружје тврдејќи дека црквата е премногу богата и треба да биде добротворна, а не алчна. Вклучувањето на двајцата свештеници беше паметен потег. Запомнете дека ова сѐ уште беше во врвот на контроверзијата за Дарвин. Дарвин ја поделил верата во учењата на Црквата и многу луѓе би ја огорчиле моќта на Црквата само од таа гледна точка. Црквата не била толку сигурна како што се преправала дека е.<br/><br/>Вечерните вести на 7 јуни 1895 година напишаа:<br/><br/>Ако црковните соработници не се решат одеднаш, градежниот октопод ќе се фати за дрвото кое подоцна ќе биде многу тешко да се олабави. Затоа треба Лондонците да бидат и да прават ако сакаат да заштедат еден од најубавите делови од селскиот пејзаж. Јавната истрага е одложена до следниот четврток, а пред тоа мора да се направи нешто за да се убедат комесарите дека граѓаните на Лондон нема да толерираат конфискација на едно од нивните омилени игралишта.<br/><br/>Писмо во Daily Chronicle следниот ден вели:<br/><br/>..... Тоа беше со големо олеснување дека жителите, пред околу десет години, слушнале дека купувањето на Горната шума е извршено; и колку прекрасна благослов тоа се покажа, секој кој ги посети може да сведочи, но сите кои се напрегнаа да ги спасат овие горни шуми, кои лежат на западната страна на Muswell Hill патот, сметаат дека нивната победа е нецелосна сè додека шеесет хектари на источната останува во опасност. Тоа е, така да се каже, несреќа што шумите се поделени со широк висок пат. Може ли некој да се сомнева во тоа што ефектот ќе биде ако Churchyard Долна шума беа заменети со редови на мали вили, секој испраќајќи го својот придонес на чад и чад? Може ли некој да се сомнева, исто така, во сериозната разлика што би ја направила за живописната околина на купената шума, ако линијата на зјапање во нови куќи би се движела право на нивниот лиснат фронт?<br/><br/>Ова го изрази мислењето на многумина. Всушност, Гравијската шума, која писателот ја нарекува „Горна шума“, не била купена, туку ѝ била дадена на областа од страна на Црковната комисија, точка што требаше да ја повторуваат повторно и повторно во текот на годините, но повеќето луѓе ја игнорирале. Комисијата немаше да даде второ дрво, што и да рече некој, и ја задржа оваа позиција до крај.<br/><br/>Х.С. Чамберлејн, од 5 Кранли Гарденс, во писмо до Тајмс од 8 јуни 1895 година, повикува на купување.<br/><br/>Знам дека е вообичаено да се зборува грубо за црковните комесари, но како доверители на еден фонд, тие се обврзани да управуваат со него за најголема корист, и затоа, ако нешто треба да се направи за да се спаси рушење на дрвото, ми се чини дека тоа може да се направи само со купување на имотот од comnussioners, кои знам, се целосно живи за заштита на слободен простор.<br/><br/>(Ова се однесува на игралиштето Крауч Енд, кое беше обезбедено неколку години подоцна.)<br/><br/>Како претседател на Конзервативната асоцијација на Масвел Хил, постојано сум во контакт со жителите и можам безбедно да потврдам дека секое лице кое живее во соседството би направило сè за да го зачува.<br/><br/>(Сè што тој лично сакаше беше добротворни приходи за поддршка на своите сиромашни луѓе. Тој побара неговиот хектар на земјиште - не многу сигурно - тој веруваше дека уверувањето на комесарите дека дрвото не е во опасност.)<br/><br/>„Масвел Хил Роуд беше еден од најдобрите во Хорнси и ќе остане подеднакво убав, без разлика дали има куќи или нема.<br/><br/>(Потоа дојде големата реторика.)<br/><br/>"Дали сиромашните да страдаат поради сентименталните приговори и хистеричниот повик на "волкот штотуку подигнат од вашите дописници? Нешто мора да се направи и тоа наскоро. Еден хектар земја додадена на добротворниот имот нема да направи значајна разлика за преостанатата земја, додека добивката што произлегува од него ќе помогне на многу сиромашни стари и заслужни лица во нивните паднати години и ќе ни овозможи да им го предадеме на нашите наследници имотот кој во далечна иднина ќе биде од голема вредност во давањето добротворна помош на заслужните сиромашни од парохијата на Хорнсеј.<br/><br/>Читајќи го неговото писмо, човек чувствува хистерија многу блиску до површината. Зошто мислеше дека комесарите сакаат да изградат пат? Зошто би ги потрошиле сите тие пари, ако не и за изградба на куќи? Изгледа дека никогаш не сфатил дека за еден хектар земја целата шума ќе биде изгубена. Но, тој бил со проблемот долго време. Тој беше личноста на која комесарите му ја понудија продажбата за 25.000 фунти пред неколку години и тоа е неговото име кое е почестено на плочата на Кулата со часовник на Крауч за зачувување на дрвото, но неговата доверба во црковните комесари изгледа наивно. Тажно е што на истрагата тој требаше да биде фрлен како ѓаволот.<br/><br/>Истрагата продолжува<br/><br/>Во Хајгејт на 15 јуни 1895. Очекувајќи голем собир, Советот на домот бил целосно променет. Вообичаените маси биле отстранети и собата била исполнета со столици. До 7 часот наутро собата беше преполна со луѓе кои се бореа за места.<br/><br/>Г-дин Мареј, комесарот, рече дека истрагата е навистина едноставна. Хорнси Парохијалните добротворни организации сакаа да купат парче земја во близина на нивниот добротворен имот на задната страна. Прашањето беше дали добротворната комисија, која ги контролираше сите добротворни организации, имаше доволно моќ да ги сопре. Црковните комесари биле подготвени да го продадат земјиштето под многу поволни услови и приходот на милосрдието ќе биде значително зголемен.<br/><br/>Против ова имало три класи на приговори.<br/><br/>Првобитната доверба била со цел да се обезбедат куќи за сиромашните, но доверителите предлагале да се изградат вили кои би биле премногу скапи за сиромашните. Сепак, тоа било во моќта на доверителите да ги менуваат условите на довербата, така што тие можеле да градат вили ако мислеле дека сиромашните ќе имаат корист на крајот. И самите сиромашни луѓе можеле да приговорат, но за нив веќе биле ветени либерални одредби. Третиот приговор се однесувал на естетската и јавната страна на прашањето. Тој го зема од она што го прочитал дека Комисијата за милосрдие треба да се вмеша за да ги спречи црковните комесари да ја користат сопствената дискреција во справувањето со сопствениот имот.<br/><br/>Во истрагата се дискутираше за фини точки, но говорниците продолжија да се враќаат на главниот проблем за спречување на уништување на дрвото. Клеркот од Ислингтон, кој претставувал 300.000 луѓе, направил формален протест против било кој дел од дрвото, толку вреден за луѓето од Ислингтон и Хорнси кои се користат за приватни цели. Вилфред Вајт рече дека ако комесарите им дадат време, тие ќе можат да соберат пари за да ги компензираат доверителите.<br/><br/>Бомон рече дека не сакаат вили, тие сакаат колиби за сиромашните луѓе кои се протерани од областа. Други рекоа дека нема пари за изградба на куќи за да ги замени сегашните оштетени, но вилите ќе бидат економски предлог. Други одговориле дека има голем број вили да се пуштат во Хајгејт. Шумата била света. Останете на прашањето за шумата.<br/><br/>Д-р Флечер рече дека повикот меѓу работниците бил дека нема каде да одат. Работничките луѓе дојдоа кај него со повик, "Ние сме истерани од Хајгејт и сме должни да одиме во Хајгејт Нов Град." Ако фасадата на Мусвел Хил Роуд била продадена, немало сомнеж дека патиштата можеле да бидат пресечени директно низ шумата во насока на Хорнси, но ако комесарите не можеле да ја добијат земјата од Добротворната комисија, тие не можеле да го пресечат патот.<br/><br/>Тој беше убеден дека куќите можат да бидат ставени во исправна состојба на поправка. Тој бил побаран од сиромашните луѓе, од полицијата и од голем број на работничките класи да ги претставуваат овие две точки, дека сместувањето во куќа е многу потребно во Хајгејт и дека ако некогаш дозволат земјата да се продаде, нема да се знае каде ќе остане раката на градителот.<br/><br/>(Гласни и долготрајни поздрави).<br/><br/>Бројни други луѓе зборуваа, а Комуникаторот сумираше велејќи дека смета дека преовладувачкото мислење е во корист на задржување на колибите, но на состанокот не треба да се извлечат заклучоци од она што го кажал (Гронс).<br/><br/>Други велат дека доверителите на милосрдието не успеале да ги извршат своите должности дозволувајќи им на колибите да паднат во хаос.<br/><br/>Г-дин Х.Р. Вилијамс, доверителот кој претходно му напишал на весникот, рече дека има најдобро овластување дека црковните комесари нема да прават патишта и нема да имаат корист од акциите на добротворните комесари. Други беа далеку помалку доверливи и состанокот заврши по речиси три часа.<br/><br/>„Соочени сме со фактот дека во Хајгејт и Масвел Хил има голем број луѓе кои ја сакаат Долната шума на црквата и нема да бидат среќни додека не ја добијат - додека никој не е подготвен да потроши пари за да ја плати. Сите велат дека би било убаво да се има дрво како отворен простор, но сите мислат дека е должност на некој друг да го направи. Islington Vestry има „решено“ на оваа тема, но Islington Vestry не нуди паричка за купувањето. Не постои потешки проблем за заедницата или поединецот да се реши од тоа како да се стекне со сопственост на туѓ имот без да се плати за тоа.<br/><br/>Плаќањето за тоа навистина беше проблем како Churchyard Bottom Wood стана предмет на интензивна локална и национална дебата. Заеднички комитет беше формиран за да се соберат пари за да се спаси дрво. На 20 ноември 1896, C.F. Кори-Рајт, почесен благајник, му напишал на дневниот весник Стандард во тоа време, повикувајќи на помош. Тој ги потсети сите за опасноста од губење на дрвото и рече дека може да се спаси само со купување. Црковните комесари ќе се продаваат за £ 25.000 и екстра (5,000 ќе бидат потребни за оградување и одводнување, што вкупно £ 30,000. Ова беше премногу за Хорнси Советот да се подигне, но тие веќе гласаа £ 10,000 кон вкупно. Шумата била од непроценлива вредност за целиот Северен Лондон, па тој ги повикал јавните тела и приватните лица да ги соберат преостанатите 20.000 фунти. Тој предупредил дека сегашната понуда од црковните комесари била отворена само до крајот на 1898 година. Потоа градежниците ќе се преселат.<br/><br/>Жалбата беше топло поздравена од страна на печатот. Приватен предлог-закон беше во брзање преку Парламентот и Законот за зачувување на Хајгејт Вудс, 1897, стана закон. Конунитите сега имаа право да рекламираат придонеси за купување на дрвото и зачувување.<br/><br/>Во прилично кратко време речиси сите пари беа собрани, но последните неколку илјади се покажаа како многу тешки за собирање и рокот на комесарите беше само прашање на недели. Кори-Рајт напишал молба за повеќе време, но добил само три месеци, а потоа само ако се исплати камата од 4% за дополнителниот период на целосната сума. На крајот, Советот на Округот Лондон, кој првично понудил 2.500 фунти, го направил ова до 5.000 фунти и вкупниот износ бил постигнат, но тоа било нешто блиску.<br/><br/>Советот одлучил да го преименува дрвото како „Кралица на шумите“ во чест на дијамантскиот јубилеј на кралицата Викторија, а Хорнси се појавил на убава изложба кога војвотката од Албани официјално го прогласила дрвото отворено за „слободна употреба за јавноста засекогаш“.<br/><br/>Додека кампањата за спасување на Долната шума на црквата беше водена и водена од локалните луѓе кои страстно се чувствуваа за ова конкретно парче шума, тие побараа помош и искуство од огромна мрежа на луѓе, од кои некои работеа заедно на слични кампањи повеќе од триесет години. Комитетот издаде жалба, испечатена на многу квалитетна хартија и со некои познати имиња.<br/><br/>Прашањата за отворен простор и јавното здравје биле главни теми на викторијанската визија.<br/><br/>Движењето за отворени простори<br/><br/>Октавија Хил, големата стамбена реформаторка, која започнала со три стари куќи во Мерилебон, купени за неа од Џолм Раскин, брзо станала експерт за сместување на сиромашните луѓе во најздравите можни услови. Нејзиниот начин беше да купи лизинг, а потоа да сруши некои од преполните куќи за да донесе светлина и воздух до останатите, верувајќи дека свежиот воздух и сончевата светлина се единствениот начин на кој сиромашните луѓе можат да бидат спасени од "гнила треска". Таа го научила ова како дете од нејзиниот дедо, Саутвуд Смит, кој ги развил своите теории во болницата за треска во Кингс Крос.<br/><br/>Тој ги изградил првите индустриски станови за сиромашните луѓе и статистички докажал дека добар воздух и пристојна дренажа спасиле животи. Гибсон Гарденс, во Нортволд Роуд, е директен резултат на идеите на Саутвуд Смит. Повеќе информации за Гибсон Гарденс<br/><br/>Важноста на отворениот воздух<br/><br/>Отворените простори и можноста да се дише чист воздух, беа од суштинско значење за луѓето кои живеат во една или две преполни соби. Октавија Хил ги презела своите обвиненија од сиромашните квартови на Лисон Гроув, до авенијата Фицџон до Хампстед Хит. Таа толку ги сакаше полињата на Фитзјон авенијата што се обиде да ги купи како јавен парк. Тие требаше да чинат 10.000 фунти и во рок од три недели во август беа собрани 8.500 фунти. Потребен бил само крајот на летните празници и враќањето од одмор на сочувствителни пријатели и дополнителни 1.500 фунти, но сопствениците одеднаш ја повлечеле својата понуда. И покрај сите молби, полињата биле покриени со големи куќи.<br/><br/>Од ова се развила кампањата за спасување на Парламент Хил, следниот отворен простор северно од Лисон Гроув, купувајќи полиња на патот на градителите за да направат постојан кордон за санитарија против напредните тули. Кампањата на Парламентот Хил Филдс беше толку успешна што беше донесен законот за Хемпстед Хит и имаше пари од жалбата. Од овие пари и поттик кон отворени простори, требаше да се развие Националниот доверба. Октавија Хил со години била заинтересирана за заштита на областите како Црквата на дното на шумата, па таа била природен сојузник во борбата за спасување на шумата.<br/><br/>Здружението за зачувување на Долниот дом, исто така, беше запознаено со овој вид на агитација и собирање пари. Тие ги срушиле оградите кога господарите на имотот имале затворени парчиња заедничка земја, водејќи и легални и нелегални битки против арогантната приватизација на традиционално слободната земја. Роберт Хантер, нивниот почесен адвокат од 1868 година, отсекогаш бил загрижен за обезбедување на отворени простори, големи или мали, за јавноста. Тој, сега Сер Роберт Хантер, стана претседател на Црквата Долен жалба. Претседателот на Друштвото за зачувување на Долниот дом беше г-дин Шо-Лефевр пратеник (подоцна Лорд Еверсли) кој играше голема улога во оваа и други кампањи во Долниот дом. Октавија Хил беше вклучена во нивната работа од околу 1875 година.<br/><br/>Во исто време, Октавија Хил водеше кампања за закон за погребување.<br/><br/>Градските гробишта станале толку полни и толку сериозна опасност за здравјето, со загадување на бунарите од кои луѓето ја црпат водата за пиење, што повеќе не им било дозволено да ги погребуваат градовите. Наместо тоа, биле создадени гробишта на периферијата на градот. Постои движење за отстранување на надгробните споменици на рабовите на старите градски гробишта, повторно закопување на телата на друго место и претворање на гробиштата во градини и отворени простори, наместо градење на нив. Оваа земја во центарот на Лондон била многу вредна и шпекулантите биле желни да ја добијат: Дури и Квекерите изградиле над еден од нивните гробишта и се заканиле дека ќе го сторат тоа повторно со изградба над полињата Банхил. Октавија Хил имала мрежа на сојузници на десетина полиња, па нејзината помош во спасувањето на црковната шума сигурно била непроценлива.<br/><br/>Митрополитот Градини друштво, основана во 1882 година, имаше поставено околу двеста мали градини во градските центри до 1890 година. Тие подоцна ги предадоа на локалните власти, така што нивната поддршка за Churchyard Дното Дрво жалба беше обезбедена од самиот почеток.<br/><br/>Друштвото Кирле сега е заборавено, но во своето време имало големо влијание врз урбанистичкото планирање и законодавството за отворен простор. Друштвото било основано околу 1875 година за „Дифузија на убавината“, за да внесе боја и интерес во животот на луѓето кои живеат во досадна, мрачна околина. Светла боја на ѕидовите и декорацијата, добро пеење, отворени простори, Природа, литература и уметност. Постоеше Декоративна гранка, за која Вилијам Морис предаваше; Музичка гранка за промовирање на хорови и Среќни вечери за луѓето во локалните училишни згради; и книжевна гранка. Друштвото редовно апелираше со писма во Тајмс, до „побогатите класи“ за книги и периодични изданија кои ќе се дистрибуираат до момчињата и девојчињата, клубовите, милосрдните домови и на други места. Името Кирле потекнува од делото на папата „Човекот од Рос“, филантропот кој го дал своето родно место на луѓето како јавен парк. |
| With Thanksgiving around the corner, here are some festive file folder games we made for the girls. Both Thanksgiving games focus on math skills. And I'm grateful once again to my husband, Ed, for making all the clipart for me.<br/><br/>Thanksgiving Pattern Making<br/><br/>Like the name says, this game is about making patterns. Little ones just learning about patterns, can simply match the pictures onto the pattern strips, while others can continue the pattern with the picture cards on the blank strips.<br/><br/>To make the file folder, you want to cut out the grid of pictures to make the card pieces. I recommend laminating them to help them last longer. Then glue the pattern strips down on the file folder.<br/><br/>I wanted to have the blank pattern strips too so that the girls could see where to continue the pattern and how many to lay out. I attached them to the side of the folder using tape so that they could fold in to pack up the game and extend to layout the pattern.<br/><br/>I also added an extra blank one so that the girls could make their own pattern as well.<br/><br/>Turkey Number Game<br/><br/>In this game the girls add the feathers to the turkey body while practicing counting and number recognition. I used the colorless feathers to act as a guide for where to add the feathers and so that the girls could match the numbers. And be sure when gluing down the turkey body you only glue in the center so that the wing pieces can slide under the body.<br/><br/>Once all the feathers are laid out, we practice some simple arithmetic, such as taking away three feathers and seeing how many are left then adding two back to see what it equals.<br/><br/>In addition to black and white wings, we also included a colorless turkey in case you want to have the little ones color their own set. Instead of a file folder game you can turn this into a craft, coloring the pieces, cutting them out, and gluing them together.<br/><br/>Another option is to use the pieces to make a felt board story. We sometimes sing a turkey version of 10 Little Indians:<br/><br/>Like this:<br/><br/>Who Am I?<br/><br/>I think this is where I'm suppose to say something witty about myself. Oh well. I'm a stay-at-home mom to three awesome kids--our twin daughters who are seven now and a two-year-old son who is full of energy. In my pre-children life I was a teacher and I now homeschool our children. I'm also married to Ed, who is currently serving in the Air Force, and is the love of my life (it'd be awkward if he wasn't). Our family is big on books, crafts, and having fun together. I just thought I would share our activities in my own little corner of the internet.<br/><br/>Zoe appears to have it all--rich, handsome husband, easy New York life--but she made mistakes in her past and those mistakes are coming back up in her new life. I found myself on the edge of my seat for most of the book and was surprised...<br/><br/>I loved this book, I love the story, and I am grateful Margot Shetterly brought it to light. My only complaint was that I wished she discussed Katherine Johnson's role in the later missions a bit more but I guess the story had to end som...<br/><br/>I wanted to like this book and I did throughout most of it. Dana finds out her estranged husband and his girlfriend are found dead in the New Mexico desert. I was immediately drawn in by her character and the story. I really enjoyed seei... | Со Денот на благодарноста зад аголот, тука се некои празнични игри со папки за датотеки што ги направивме за девојките. Двете игри за Денот на благодарноста се фокусираат на математички вештини. И уште еднаш сум благодарен на мојот сопруг, Ед, што го направи целиот клипарт за мене.<br/><br/>Денот на благодарноста<br/><br/>Како што кажува името, оваа игра е за правење на модели. Малите само учење за модели, може едноставно да се совпаѓаат со сликите на лентите на моделот, додека други можат да продолжат со моделот со картичките со слики на празните ленти.<br/><br/>За да ја направите папката со датотеки, сакате да ја исечете мрежата на слики за да ги направите деловите од картичката. Препорачувам да ги ламинирате за да им помогнете да траат подолго. Потоа залепете ги лентите на моделот надолу на папката со датотеки.<br/><br/>Сакав да ги имам и празните ленти за да можат девојките да видат каде да продолжат со шемата и колку да положат. Ги прикачив на страната на папката користејќи лента за да можат да се склопат за да ја спакуваат играта и да се прошират за да го распоредат моделот.<br/><br/>Исто така, додадов и екстра празна една, така што девојките може да се направи свој шема, исто така.<br/><br/>Турција броеви игра<br/><br/>Во оваа игра, девојките додаваат пердуви на телото на мисирката додека вежбаат броење и препознавање на броеви. Јас ги користев безбојните пердуви за да дејствувам како водич за тоа каде да ги додадете пердувите и така што девојките можат да се совпаѓаат со броевите. И бидете сигурни дека кога ќе го залепите телото на мисирката, ќе го залепите само во центарот, така што парчињата од крилјата ќе можат да се лизгаат под телото.<br/><br/>Откако сите пердуви се поставени, ние практикуваме некоја едноставна аритметика, како што се отстранување на три пердуви и гледање колку има останато, а потоа додавање на две назад за да видиме што е еднакво.<br/><br/>Покрај црно-белите крилја, ние исто така вклучивме безбојна мисирка во случај да сакате да ги обоите малите. Наместо игра со папки со датотеки, можете да го претворите ова во занает, да ги боите парчињата, да ги исечете и да ги залепите заедно.<br/><br/>Друга опција е да се користат парчиња да се направи чувствува одбор приказна. Ние понекогаш пееме мисирка верзија на 10 Мали Индијанци:<br/><br/>Вака:<br/><br/>Кој сум јас?<br/><br/>Мислам дека тука треба да кажам нешто смешно за себе. Јас сум мајка која останува дома на три неверојатни деца - нашите ќерки близначки кои сега имаат седум години и двегодишен син кој е полн со енергија. Во мојот пред-детски живот бев учител и сега ги учам нашите деца дома. Јас сум исто така во брак со Ед, кој во моментов служи во воздухопловните сили, и е љубовта на мојот живот (би било незгодно ако не беше). Нашето семејство е големо во книгите, занаетчиството и забавата заедно. Само мислев дека ќе ги споделам нашите активности во мојот мал агол на интернет.<br/><br/>Зои изгледа дека го има сето тоа - богат, згоден сопруг, лесен Њујорк живот - но таа направи грешки во нејзиното минато и тие грешки се враќаат во нејзиниот нов живот. Се најдов на работ на моето седиште за поголемиот дел од книгата и беше изненаден...<br/><br/>Ја сакав оваа книга, ја сакам приказната, и јас сум благодарен Маргот Shetterly го донесе на светлината. Мојата единствена жалба беше дека сакав таа разговараше за улогата на Кетрин Џонсон во подоцнежните мисии малку повеќе, но претпоставувам дека приказната мораше да заврши со со...<br/><br/>Сакав да се допаѓа оваа книга и јас го направив во текот на поголемиот дел од тоа.

| Alcohol use by persons under age 21 has been identified as a major public health problem. Studies note that it increases the risks for disability, and may be detrimental to the developing brain. Minors who drink are more likely to commit suicide, break the law, or be victims of violence. Alcohol is implicated in nearly one-third of youth traffic fatalities. The total annual cost of underage drinking is estimated at $62 billion. While most laws intended to prevent underage drinking are passed at the state level, there has been legislative activity and interest at the federal level to support states' efforts to curb the problem. This report describes the extent of underage alcohol use, recent legislative activity on this issue, and various policy implications. It will be updated as new data become available. | Употребата на алкохол кај лица под 21 година е идентификувана како голем проблем за јавното здравје. Истражувањата истакнуваат дека го зголемува ризикот од инвалидност и може да биде штетно за мозокот во развој. Малолетниците кои пијат имаат поголема веројатност да извршат самоубиство, да го прекршат законот или да бидат жртви на насилство. Алкохолот е вмешан во речиси една третина од смртните случаи во сообраќајот на младите. Вкупните годишни трошоци за пиење на малолетници се проценуваат на 62 милијарди долари. Додека повеќето закони наменети за спречување на малолетничкото пиење се донесуваат на државно ниво, има законодавна активност и интерес на федерално ниво за поддршка на напорите на државите за спречување на проблемот. Овој извештај го опишува степенот на употреба на алкохол кај малолетници, неодамнешната законодавна активност на ова прашање и разни импликации на политиката. Ќе се ажурира како што ќе станат достапни нови податоци. |
| Tag Archives: real food<br/><br/>Last week I wrote about the Nordic Food Manifesto, and how Denmark created a strong "real food" culture largely from an intentional effort led by Claus Meyer. It wasn't political lobbying or public petitioning that resulted in food reform, but rather a grassroots effort led by citizens with the power to actually implement and follow-through with change.<br/><br/>I ended the post alluding to one question: Why is it so hard for us to do this ourselves, as individuals? If an entire country can implement and spread a common view towards food, why can't we?<br/><br/>There's nothing really stopping us from mimicking Denmark's success. The problem is, we're inundated with so many messages about what we should be eating, and how we should be living, it's hard to know where to start. So rather than following successful frameworks that have been shown to work (like the Nordic Food Manifesto), most people jump from diet craze to diet craze, trying to find the "right way to eat."<br/><br/>But how did Claus Meyer succeed? What was the secret sauce that helped the Manifesto take hold? And is it reasonable to think we can apply those lessons to our own lives?

The unique outer crispiness of the meat gave way to a perfectly juicy interior, resulting in a sound more similar to slicing into a calzone than a ground beef patty.<br/><br/>We were sitting in Copenhagen's oldest pub, which felt more like a casual bistro than a bar, and I was about to try the dish recommended by our waitress/bar tender/proprietor?<br/><br/>"The Paris Beef, it's very good," she had said.

Не беше политичко лобирање или јавни петиции кои резултираа со реформа на храната, туку напор од корен предводен од граѓаните со моќ да ги спроведат и да ги следат промените.<br/><br/>Го завршив постот алудирајќи на едно прашање: Зошто е толку тешко за нас да го направиме ова, како поединци? Ако цела земја може да имплементира и да шири заеднички поглед кон храната, зошто ние не можеме?<br/><br/>Нема ништо што навистина не спречува да го имитираме успехот на Данска. Проблемот е што сме преплавени со толку многу пораки за тоа што треба да јадеме и како треба да живееме, тешко е да се знае од каде да започнеме. Значи, наместо да ги следат успешните рамки за кои се покажа дека работат (како што е нордискиот манифест за храна), повеќето луѓе скокаат од лудост за исхрана до лудост за исхрана, обидувајќи се да го најдат "вистинскиот начин на јадење".<br/><br/>Но, како успеа Клаус Мејер? Кој беше тајниот сос кој му помогна на Манифестот да се задржи? И дали е разумно да се мисли дека можеме да ги примениме овие лекции во нашите животи?
