| While acknowledging that it's impossible to argue someone into loving something they hate, and vice versa, it's still often enjoyable to attempt the argument. When we talk to people whose opinions directly contradict ours, we're forced to defend our tastes, define our opinions, and analyze why we react the way we do. Which is why we have Why Don't You Like This?, in which two of our staffers will attempt to discover whether people with opposing opinions can get beyond "No, you're wrong!" and have a civil, constructive, and possibly even convincing discussion about their points of contention. Because no matter what talk radio says, there's still a middle ground between "We agree utterly" and "I'm right, and you're stupid and evil."<br/><br/>Scott: Since discussing my Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World apostasy, we've been looking for a case where I can call you out for not liking something wonderful, and we didn't have to look for long. We were sitting right next to each other during Martin Scorsese's Hugo—me, utterly enchanted by its fantastical tribute to the wonders of early silent cinema, and you, apparently resisting it at every turn. Critical consensus has been on my side: It hit the No. 9 spot on our collective Top 15 (though you listed it as your Overrated choice), has won (or placed) in various film-critic awards, and currently enjoys an 83 score on Metacritic. That doesn't mean you're wrong, of course, but the onus is on you to explain why Hugo was, in your words, "hollow and artificial," where many of us saw it as a lovely evocation of Scorsese's childhood and the medium when it was still in its infancy. And please be gentle as you rip this butterfly apart by the wings.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Tasha: I can't be gentle, Scott. Sometimes it hurts less if you rip the Band-Aid off all at once. (And even if it doesn't, who wants to walk around wearing a half-ripped-off Band-Aid? Gross.) The fact is, I found Hugo to be a wearyingly manipulative exercise in fakery, starting from its opening glide through a Paris train station, which reminded me more than anything of Robert Zemeckis' The Polar Express. Unlike Mike D'Angelo, I'm a fan of long, unbroken takes as a way of establishing a space and encouraging viewers to unconsciously hold their breaths as a camera explores an area; but when the space being explored is a slick, shiny CGI creation, and the camera floats weightlessly through it with no physical sense that either the camera or the surroundings are really there, that exploration starts to feel like watching someone else play a videogame. And the rest of the film felt similarly poreless and unreal to me, both in terms of its setting and in terms of its highly contrived, maudlin story.<br/><br/>I don't necessarily have a problem with manufactured, stylized environments in film. I loved Baz Luhrmann's equally sprawling, utterly artificial take on Paris in Moulin Rouge, for instance, but that film has a sense of its own ridiculousness, a sense of humor about how deliberately over-the-top it is. Ditto the stylization of Jean-Pierre Jeunet, particularly in Amélie. (Both Jeunet and Luhrmann felt like strong visual influences here.) I got the sense, however, that Martin Scorsese wanted me to take Hugo entirely seriously. Even though it's yet another achingly sentimental story about a plucky orphan bringing color back into the life of a grumpy old curmudgeon. And I just couldn't.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>There is nothing I enjoy more in film than being surprised. And there's nothing I resent and resist more than being overtly manipulated, being loudly told what to feel and when to feel it. A good film does this kind of thing subtly; a bad one uses crashing music cues and sweet strings—and in this case, a grubby, huge-eyed, disheveled orphan staring woefully at the camera—to demand pathos, and to tell viewers they're horrible people if they don't serve it up on demand. That said, I can deal with sad kids and grumpy adults making life better for each other—I really dug this year's Le Havre, which was essentially the same plot without all the cutesiness—but I find the artificial environments reflect badly on the artificial emotions, and each makes the other seem more fake by turns.<br/><br/>Let's start with that. In our overlooked films video, you and Noel both took Keith to task for championing Tyrannosaur, because you felt it wasn't realistic enough—too contrived, too miserablist, too much, too far. How is it possible that you can't buy a stymied old crank who breaks things when he's angry, but you can buy an orphan living inside a giant train-station clock and embarking upon a whimsical journey to repair a mysterious automaton that he believes might bear secrets from his dead father, but which instead leads him on a quirky voyage of self-discovery, into the magical land of cinema? Did you never find Hugo's gaudy rococo design, aggressive heartstring-plucking, or wheelbarrow-loads of quirk even a little excessive or hard to swallow?<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Scott: Jeunet and Luhrmann as influences on Scorsese?! Forget being indelicate, now you're deliberately poking me with a sharp stick. If you're looking for inspirations for Hugo—indeed, if you're looking for the emotional core of Hugo—you have to go back to Scorsese's childhood on Elizabeth Street in Little Italy, where an asthmatic little boy, unable to play outside with the other kids, retreated to Alexander Korda fantasies like The Thief Of Bagdad. Or, more simply, just go straight to the source himself: George Méliès, whose A Trip To The Moon remains the Big Bang of all cinematic fantasies, that moment when the camera was not used to document the world as it is, but whatever whimsical, magical, transporting place a filmmaker wants to invent for it. And that tradition has been developed and expanded upon for decades before the likes of Jeunet and Luhrmann got their grubby little paws on it.<br/><br/>And speaking of Jeunet, nice attempt to take away my rhetorical weapon, but I'll say it anyway: How can you love Amélie, yet find Hugo synthetic and "excessive" and "wearyingly manipulative"? You say that Amélie and Moulin Rouge have redeeming "sense of [their] own ridiculousness" where Scorsese means us to take Hugo seriously, and I don't think that's the case, at least on the latter point. That Scorsese feels evident passion about the movies is, I suppose, why you'd interpret Hugo as self-serious. But to me, it's those feelings that give the film an emotional ballast that the Luhrmann and Jeunet films don't have. All three films make aggressive use of the marvels of CGI—and Scorsese adds 3D to the mix, to wonderful effect—but where you and I differ is on the issue of weightlessness. I agree that CGI has a distancing effect; worlds composed entirely of digital plasticine are flexible to the point where they sometimes have no presence. You referred to Hugo in your "Overrated" entry for our Best Of Film piece as "a CGI gimcrack"—a perfect dis… for another movie.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>It's fair to say that Scorsese has built Hugo around a standard-issue, "heartstring-plucking" children's book/movie plot: Orphan misses his daddy, creates his own little fantasy world, gloms onto a new friend, convinces a crusty old fuddy-duddy to soften up and maybe adopt him. But that's just the narrative skeleton, and Scorsese provides plenty of flesh and blood. For one, you can't watch Hugo, the lonely boy, peering out from clock towers to the hustle-and-bustle of a Paris train station without thinking of Scorsese, another lonely boy, staring out of his bedroom window on Elizabeth Street. And even if you're not a big enough film nerd to make that connection, I really feel like Hugo's journey is not in finding a new father figure, but in persisting with the mechanical magic that stands as his own father's legacy. That's what film is: The persistence of vision that allows us to accept an illusory version of the world at 24 frames per second is science and magic at once. Hugo's relationship with Méliès isn't about him cozying up to a new daddy, but sharing a common enthusiasm the old man has submerged in bitterness. To me, that's a far more unique angle on a potentially shopworn premise.<br/><br/>Did you really find none of Hugo enchanting? Even the film's few detractors seem willing to admit that the sequences evoking cinema history and Méliès' studio—with Michael Stuhlbarg as the heroic film scholar!—were terrific. It felt, in the best possible way, like a heady compression of my History Of Film 101 class in college, condensing a semester's worth of clips and context into something between a montage and an animated pop-up book. And it speaks to the ingenious design of the film, which layers fact and fantasy so beautifully that it's at once a history of Méliès and the birth of cinema, and just the sort of simple, sumptuously produced cinematic wonder that Scorsese himself would have loved as a child. Thank goodness Hugo doesn't follow the Jeunet/Luhrmann model and have "a sense of its own ridiculousness." As a fantasy connoisseur yourself, wouldn't you say there's value in playing it straight and earnest and unabashed rather than winking at the audience? You may find Hugo sickly sweet, but I don't think the authenticity of its sentiment is to be denied.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Tasha: Yes, I did in fact find parts of Hugo enchanting. (Notice how I'm answering your question up front, whereas you were too busy frothing with apoplexy to address mine, though I assume that's an answer in its own right. Okay, "influence" may be overstating the case—I just meant the visual style looked very familiar. Though as Keith pointed out when you brought this up in person, Scorsese is neither opposed to drawing inspiration from other people's visuals, nor immune to it.) Primarily, I was enchanted by the parts dealing with Georges Méliès' backstory, with his love of cinema, with the work he put into his art and the joy he got out of it. There's an awful lot of beauty and fun in the staging of the underwater-court scene from Méliès' "Fairyland," and in the sequence at the end, focusing on Méliès footage. I'll grant you that Hugo's connection with Méliès over a shared love of film is a nice touch. And I do enjoy a good film about filmmaking.<br/><br/>But Hugo isn't primarily about film, in spite of the Méliès tie-ins. In addition to the themes you cite, it's also about finding your purpose, as the characters expressly, laboriously explain to each other and to us. And it's about spectacle, and big action setpieces, and chases, and happily-ever-after endings where even the angry bully and the shy older couple and fergawdsakes even the cranky dachshund all get paired off with charming love interests by the end. It's about the super-precocious Hermione Granger-type being bossy and perky and clever and praising the magical worlds encased in books. And all of this business is mighty familiar, and mighty artificial.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Yes, Scorsese is playing with archetypes. Problem is, I never felt he imbued them with anything new, fresh, or believable, in spite of his own backstory. I would have much preferred a story about a young Scorsese growing up with asthma—something small-scale and real, without vast rooms full of CGI clockwork and golden glowing dust-motes and prophetic dreams and a raging adult tyrant-guard with a heart of gold—all of that outsized, over-the-top nonsense. You keep citing Scorsese's personal background and love of film as evidence that he's really feeling what he's putting on the screen, but I don't feel his personal touch in any of this, except the moments that are expressly about film. The core emotions may be real, but that doesn't make the execution less false.<br/><br/>You say the authenticity of the emotion isn't to be denied. I don't question whether Scorsese personally felt lonely and isolated as a child, but I don't feel loneliness and isolation on the screen—I see a bunch of exaggerated signifiers (Hugo is filthy and his clothes are worn and all the adults yell at him and he regularly gets chased by a scary dog!) and big beats, with shouting and weeping and Spielbergian wonder-emoting. For me, sincerity is more convincing and more personal when it's quiet and direct; when someone's shouting his opinions at me, I assume he's either really angry, or just trying to overwhelm my senses to keep me from expressing my own opinion. Hugo was one long shout, as far as I was concerned.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Why didn't I get that sense of fakery from Amélie, you ask? Actually, I did. I'll completely acknowledge that Amélie and Moulin Rouge are both big, manipulative, artificial constructions in the exact same vein, demanding specific emotions at specific intervals, and trying to sell those emotions with heavy emoting and aggressive soundtrack prodding. Neither of them really sold me on their emotions as authentic human feeling. What I enjoyed in those two films was the construction—particularly Amélie's heady, laughable lists of random characterizing features and experiences for its cast, and Moulin Rouge's musical-magpie mashups and recontextualizations. I'm often sold on stories that do creative or ambitious things with structure, and both of those movies qualify, where Hugo is a much more linear, standard kid-quest.<br/><br/>But in the end, for me, it really does come down to a feeling that those movies are goofs, whereas Hugo is meant to be taken seriously at every treacly moment. You don't think that's true—but you're simultaneously defending its integrity in terms of its absolutely authentic, rooted-in-Scorsese's-history emotion, and telling me I'm wrong, and he doesn't mean it to be taken seriously. How do you reconcile those two statements? What about the film suggests to you that it isn't meant to be taken at face value? And is it possible this is just another Curious Case Of Benjamin Button-like situation where I find the use of kids in big-budget films to be largely sappy and melodramatic, whereas you as a dad find it bypasses your cynicism and goes straight to your family-feeling?<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Scott: Not sure I meant that Scorsese doesn't mean to be taken seriously; it's just that he's chosen a whimsical vehicle through which to express a serious love of the movies. When you say, "But Hugo isn't primarily about film, in spite of the Méliès tie-ins," I'm mystified. I grant that you find many elements of Hugo overly familiar and laborious and full of Spielbergian wonder-emoting—there's nothing I can do to argue around that perception, which other Hugo doubters share. Sometimes a film means to charm and enchant, and it doesn't for some; you've got Hugo and I've got Amélie, though I think the latter, deliberately artificial as it is, means for us to find it romantic. (Rather than, say, some horrible mechanical contraption fit for a Saw sequel.)<br/><br/>But to say Hugo isn't primarily about film? If it's not about film, then it's the most pointlessly discursive story about [whatever you think it's about] I've ever seen. The relationship between Hugo and Méliès is the heart of the movie, and at the heart of that is not just some stock connection between Plucky Orphan and Crusty Old Guy With A Heart Of Gold, but a shared affinity for engineered magic—specifically the magic of the movies. I think Scorsese and his collaborators have found a way to express their enthusiasm over the early days of cinema through a fantasy that's accessible to all ages. The archetype-filled children's tale is the merely the crust here; cinema is the pie. (Mmmm… pie.)<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>As for The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button, I don't see much of a connection, other than trying to expose me as a Benjamin Button defender as a way of damaging my credibility. (Incidentally, how are the extras on that G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra Blu-ray?) I've said to you that the sleep-deprived new dad in me was perhaps vulnerable to Benjamin Button, but I can't imagine a time when the premise of aging in reverse wouldn't move me. (Cradling the love of your life in your arms as an infant? How can you not be affected by that?) And besides, I don't see how Benjamin Button relates much to Hugo as a film concerning kids, since that's just a small segment of a story that spans a much larger trajectory.<br/><br/>So have I convinced you? Likely not. But I'm happy to learn that Hugo wasn't entirely devoid of enchantments for you. The sequences on Méliès the filmmaker are what put Hugo over for me—and in that, at least, we can share some movie love.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Tasha: Nope, I can't say you've convinced me, any more than I've convinced you. It's impossible to argue anyone into a visceral love of anything, and it really should be equally impossible to talk someone down from visceral love. Mostly, you've let me see Hugo in Scott-O-Vision, which is an interesting experience; at least now I'm mildly convinced that we didn't somehow manage to see entirely different films which both somehow had the same name and director.<br/><br/>We certainly had different experiences, though, and to my mind, focused on different aspects of the production: I still don't see the "film is marvelous" theme as the movie's single strand, so much as one among too many. "Pointlessly discursive" almost covers it, though I'd throw in "often needlessly cutesy and precious" on top of that. While you're focused on the film's tasty pie filling, I feel like that pie was covered with a pound of crystallized sugar, and I think that does make a difference, regardless of the film's core message or handful of terrific scenes. See also Benjamin Button, which I did not bring up just to chafe you—I really do think you have more of a sentimental streak than I do regarding children in cinema, especially when they're used more as symbols of vulnerability and innocence than as human characters. Hey, you know what film totally does not have cute wide-eyed moppets bringing hope to a cynical world? G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra. Maybe I will go watch those Blu-ray extras. I could use some explosion-insulin to compensate for Hugo's sweetness. | Додека признаваат дека е невозможно да се расправаат со некого за да сакаат нешто што го мразат, и обратно, сепак често е пријатно да се обиде аргументот. Кога разговараме со луѓе чии мислења директно се спротивставуваат на нашите, ние сме принудени да ги браниме нашите вкусови, да ги дефинираме нашите мислења и да анализираме зошто реагираме на начинот на кој реагираме. Затоа го имаме Why Don’t You Like This?, во кој двајца од нашите вработени ќе се обидат да откријат дали луѓето со спротивставени мислења можат да надминат „Не, грешиш!“ и да имаат граѓанска, конструктивна, а можеби и убедлива дискусија за нивните точки на расправа. Бидејќи без разлика што вели радиото, сеуште постои средина помеѓу "Ние целосно се согласуваме" и "Јас сум во право, а ти си глупава и зла".<br/><br/>Скот: Откако разговаравме за мојот Скот Пилгрим наспроти отпадништвото на светот, баравме случај каде што можам да ве повикам поради тоа што не ви се допаѓа нешто прекрасно, и не моравме долго да бараме. Седевме еден до друг за време на „Хуго“ на Мартин Скорсезе – јас, потполно восхитен од неговата фантастична почит кон чудата на раната нема кинематографија, а вие, очигледно, му се спротивставувате на секој чекор. Критички консензус беше на моја страна: го погоди местото број 9 на нашиот колективен Топ 15 (иако го наведовте како ваш Преценет избор), освои (или се пласираше) во различни филмски критички награди, и во моментов ужива во резултат од 83 на Metacritic. Тоа не значи дека грешите, се разбира, но одговорноста е на вас да објасните зошто Иго беше, според вашите зборови, „шуп и вештачки“, каде што многумина од нас го гледаа тоа како прекрасно евоцирање на детството на Скорсезе и медиумот кога бил сè уште во детството. И ве молам бидете нежни додека ја раскинувате пеперутката по крилјата.<br/><br/>Рекламирање<br/><br/>Таша: Не можам да бидам нежен, Скот. Понекогаш боли помалку ако ја откинеш лентата одеднаш. (И дури и ако не, кој сака да оди наоколу носејќи полу-откината лента? Грозно.) Факт е дека открив дека Хуго е заморно манипулативна вежба во фалсификување, почнувајќи од неговото отворање на лизгање низ железничката станица во Париз, што повеќе од сè ме потсетува на Поларниот експрес на Роберт Земекис. За разлика од Мајк Д’Анџело, јас сум љубител на долг, непрекинат начин на воспоставување на простор и охрабрување на гледачите несвесно да го задржат здивот додека камерата истражува област; но кога просторот што се истражува е мазна, сјајна CGI креација, а камерата лебди без тежина низ неа без физичко чувство дека камерата или околината навистина се таму, тоа истражување почнува да се чувствува како некое. А остатокот од филмот се чувствуваше подеднакво бесмислен и нереален за мене, како во однос на неговото поставување, така и во однос на неговата многу измислена, мадлин приказна.<br/><br/>Јас не мора да имаат проблем со произведени, стилизирани средини во филмот. Го сакав подеднакво опширниот, целосно вештачки поглед на Баз Лурман на Париз во Мулен Руж, на пример, но тој филм има чувство на сопствена смешност, смисла за хумор за тоа колку е намерно над-на-врвот. До стилизацијата на Жан-Пјер Жуне, особено во Амелија. (И Жуне и Лурман се чувствуваа како силни визуелни влијанија тука.) Сепак, добив чувство дека Мартин Скорсезе сакаше да го сфатам Хуго целосно сериозно. Иако тоа е уште една болно сентиментална приказна за храбро сираче кое ја враќа бојата во животот на стариот мрзлив дезертер, а јас едноставно не можев.<br/><br/>Рекламирање<br/><br/>Нема ништо што повеќе уживам во филмот од тоа да бидам изненаден. И нема ништо што повеќе се противам и се спротивставувам од тоа да бидам отворено манипулиран, да ми се кажува гласно што да чувствувам и кога да го почувствувам. Добриот филм ги прави овие работи суптилно; лош филм користи урнати музички знаци и слатки жици – и во овој случај, грубо, огромно око, распарчено сираче кое тажно зјапа во камерата – за да бара патос и да им каже на гледачите дека се ужасни луѓе ако не го служат на побарувачка. Сепак, можам да се справам со тажни деца и мрзливи возрасни кои го подобруваат животот еден за друг – навистина го ископав овогодинешниот Ле Авр, кој во суштина беше ист заговор без сите слатки – но наоѓам дека вештачките средини лошо се рефлектираат на вештачките емоции, и секој од нив го прави другиот да изгледа повеќе лажен.<br/><br/>Да почнеме со тоа. Во нашите превидени филмови, ти и Ноел го однесовте Кит на задача да се бори за Тиранозаурот, бидејќи сметавте дека тоа не е доволно реално - премногу измислено, премногу мизерно, премногу, премногу далеку. Како е можно да не можете да си купите стар лудак кој ги крши работите кога е лут, но можете да си купите сираче кое живее во џиновски часовник на железничката станица и да тргнете на каприциозно патување за да поправите мистериозен автомат за кој верува дека може да носи тајни од неговиот мртов татко, но кој наместо тоа го води на чудно патување за само-от откривање, во магичната земја на филмот? Зарем никогаш не сте го нашле Хјуговиот рококо дизајн, агресивно влечење на срцето, или колички-товар на чудаци, дури и малку претерано или тешко да се проголта?<br/><br/>Рекламирање<br/><br/>Скот: Јеунет и Лурман како влијанија врз Скорсезе?! Заборавете да бидете нетактични, сега намерно ме прободувате со остар стап. Ако барате инспирација за Хуго – всушност, ако го барате емоционалното јадро на Хуго – мора да се вратите на детството на Скорсезе на улицата Елизабет во Мала Италија, каде што едно астматично мало момче, кое не може да си игра надвор со другите деца, се повлече во фантазиите на Александар Корда како Крадецот од Багдад. Или, поедноставно, одете директно до самиот извор: Џорџ Мелиес, чие патување до месечината останува Големата експлозија на сите кинематографски фантазии, оној момент кога камерата не била користена за да го документира светот каков што е, туку она што е каприциозно, магично, транспортно место кое режисерот сака да го измисли за тоа. И таа традиција е развиена и проширена со децении пред да ги добијат своите дебели мали шепи на неа.<br/><br/>Говорејќи за Џуне, убав обид да ми го одземе реторичкото оружје, но сепак ќе кажам: како можеш да ја сакаш Амели, а сепак да го сметаш Хуго за синтетички и „претерано“ и „уморно манипулативен“? Вие велите дека Амели и Мулен Руж имаат „чувство за сопствена смешност“ каде што Скорсезе сака да го сфатиме Иго сериозно, а јас не мислам дека тоа е случај, барем во вториот дел. Тоа што Скорсезе чувствува очигледна страст за филмовите е, претпоставувам, зошто би го толкувале Хуго како сериозен, но за мене, тие чувства му даваат на филмот емоционален баласт што филмовите Лурман и Џанет го немаат. Сите три филма агресивно ги користат чудата на CGI – и Скорсезе додава 3D на миксот, со прекрасен ефект – но она што ние се разликуваме е прашањето на бестежинскоста. Се согласувам дека CGI има ефект на дистанцирање; световите составени целосно од дигитален пластелин се флексибилни до точка каде што понекогаш немаат присуство. Вие го спомнавте Хуго во вашиот „Претерано“ во нашиот дел за најдобар филм како „CGI gimcrack“ - совршен дис ... за друг филм.<br/><br/>Рекламирање<br/><br/>Може да се каже дека Скорсезе го изградил Хуго околу стандардното издание на детската книга/филм: „Сиракот го пропушта својот татко, создава свој мал свет на фантазија, се впушта во нов пријател, го убедува стариот старец да се омекне и можеби да го посвои. Но, тоа е само наративниот скелет, а Скорсезе обезбедува многу месо и крв. Како прво, не можете да го гледате Хуго, осаменото момче, како набљудува од кулите со часовници до вревата на железничката станица во Париз, без да помислите на Скорсезе, уште едно осамено момче, како гледа од прозорецот на неговата спална соба на улицата Елизабет. Дури и ако не сте доволно голем филмски штребер за да ја направите таа врска, навистина чувствувам дека патувањето на Хјуго не е во наоѓањето на нова татковска фигура, туку во упорноста со механичката магија која стои како наследство на сопствениот татко. Постојаноста на визијата која ни овозможува да прифатиме илузорна верзија на светот со 24 кадри во секунда е наука и магија одеднаш. Врската на Иго со Мелиес не е за него да се пријатно до новиот татко, но споделување на заеднички ентузијазам стариот човек е потопен во горчина. За мене, тоа е многу поуникатен агол на потенцијално продавница премиса.<br/><br/>Дури и неколкуте критичари на филмот се спремни да признаат дека секвенците кои ја потсетуваат историјата на кинематографијата и студиото на Мелиес - со Мајкл Сталбарг како херојски филмски научник! - беа одлични. Се чувствував, на најдобар можен начин, како компресија на мојот час Историја на филмот 101 на колеџ, кондензирајќи ја вредноста на семестар на клипови и контекст во нешто помеѓу монтажа и анимирана поп-ап книга. И зборува за генијалниот дизајн на филмот, кој толку убаво ги слојува фактите и фантазијата, што одеднаш е историја на Мелиес и раѓањето на кинематографијата, и само еден вид едноставно, раскошно создадено кинематографско чудо што Скорсезе самиот би го сакал како дете. Фала богу, Иго не го следи моделот на Jeunet/Luhrmann и има „чувство за сопствената смешност“. Како познавач на фантазијата, зарем не би рекол дека има вредност во тоа да се игра директно и сериозно и бесрамно, наместо да трепка на публиката? Можеби ќе го најдете Хуго болно сладок, но не мислам дека автентичноста на неговото чувство треба да се негира.<br/><br/>Рекламирање<br/><br/>Таша: Да, јас всушност најде делови од Хуго очарувачки. (Забележете како јас сум одговарање на вашето прашање однапред, додека сте биле премногу зафатени пенење со апоплексија да се обрати на мојот, иако претпоставувам дека тоа е одговор во свој право. Добро, "влијание" може да биде преувеличување на случајот-само мислев на визуелниот стил изгледаше многу познато. Иако, како што истакна Кит кога лично го споменавте ова, Скорсезе не се спротивставува ниту на цртежот на инспирација од туѓите визуели, ниту е имун на тоа.) Пред сè, бев воодушевен од делата кои се занимаваат со позадината на Жорж Мелиес, со неговата љубов кон филмот, со работата што ја вложил во својата уметност и радоста што ја извлекол од неа. Има ужасно многу убавина и забава во поставувањето на подводната сцена од „Фајерленд“ на Мелиес и во секвенцата на крајот, фокусирајќи се на снимките на Мелиес. Ќе ви признаам дека врската на Иго со Мелиес околу заедничката љубов кон филмот е убав допир и уживам во добар филм за снимање филмови.<br/><br/>Но, Иго не е првенствено за филм, и покрај врските на Мелиес. Покрај темите што ги цитирате, исто така се работи за наоѓање на вашата цел, како што ликовите експлицитно, напорно објаснуваат еден на друг и на нас. И тоа е за спектакл, и големи акциони сцени, и брка, и среќно-засекогаш-по завршува каде што дури и лутиот насилник и срамежливиот постар пар и fergawdsakes дури и развратниот јазовец сите се во пар со шармантни љубовни интереси до крајот. Станува збор за супер-прераната Хермиона Грејнџер, која е газда и наметлива и паметна и ги фали магичните светови заробени во книги.<br/><br/>Рекламирање<br/><br/>Да, Скорсезе си игра со архетипови. Проблемот е што никогаш не почувствував дека ги проголтал со нешто ново, свежо или веродостојно, и покрај неговата сопствена приказна. Јас би претпочитал приказна за млад Скорсезе кој расте со астма – нешто мало и реално, без огромни соби полни со CGI часовници и златни сјајни мотори и пророчки соништа и бесен возрасен тирански чувар со срце од злато – сето тоа преголема, над-на врвот бесмислица. Продолжувате да го цитирате личното потекло на Скорсезе и љубовта кон филмот како доказ дека тој навистина го чувствува она што го става на екранот, но јас не го чувствувам неговиот личен допир во ништо од ова, освен во моментите кои се експлицитно поврзани со филмот. Основните емоции може да бидат реални, но тоа не го прави извршувањето помалку лажно.<br/><br/>Велиш дека автентичноста на емоцијата не може да се негира. Не се сомневам дали Скорсезе лично се чувствувал осамен и изолиран како дете, но не се чувствувам осамен и изолиран на екранот – гледам куп претерани знаци (Хуго е валкан и неговата облека е облечена и сите возрасни викаат на него и тој редовно го брка страшно куче!) и големи удари, со викање и плачење и Спилбергиан. За мене, искреноста е поубедлива и повеќе лична кога е тивка и директна; кога некој ми го извикува своето мислење, претпоставувам дека е или навистина лут, или само се обидува да ги надвладее моите сетила за да ме спречи да го изразам сопственото мислење. Хуго беше еден долг вик, колку што се однесува до мене.<br/><br/>Рекламирање<br/><br/>Зошто не го добив тоа чувство на фалсификат од Амели, прашавте? Ќе признаам дека Амели и Мулен Руж се големи, манипулативни, вештачки конструкции во ист дух, барајќи специфични емоции во одредени интервали, и се обидуваат да ги продадат тие емоции со тешки емотивни и агресивни саундтраци. Ниту еден од нив не ме продал на нивните емоции како автентични човечки чувства. Она што ми се допадна во овие два филма беше конструкцијата - особено Амели е надуена, смешни листи на случајни карактеристики и искуства за нејзината актерска екипа, и Мулен Руж е музичко-магија мешавини и реконтекстуализации. Често ме продаваат на приказни кои прават креативни или амбициозни работи со структура, и двата филма се квалификуваат, каде што Хуго е многу полинеарна, стандардна потрага по дете.<br/><br/>Но, на крајот, за мене, тоа навистина се сведува на чувството дека тие филмови се глупости, додека Хуго треба да се сфати сериозно во секој треак момент. Вие не мислите дека тоа е вистина, но истовремено го браните нејзиниот интегритет во однос на нејзината апсолутно автентична, вкоренета емоција од историјата на Скорсезе, и ми кажувате дека грешам, и тој не мисли дека тоа треба да се сфати сериозно. Како ги помирувате овие две изјави? Што е со филмот што ви сугерира дека не е наменет да се сфати со номинална вредност? И дали е можно ова да е само уште еден љубопитен случај на Бенџамин Батон како ситуација каде што сметам дека користењето на децата во филмовите со голем буџет е во голема мера сапично и мелодраматично, додека ти како татко го заобиколуваш твојот цинизам и одиш право на твоето семејство-чувство?<br/><br/>Рекламирање<br/><br/>Скот: Не сум сигурен дека мислев дека Скорсезе не сака да биде сфатен сериозно; едноставно тој избра каприциозно возило преку кое ќе ја изрази сериозната љубов кон филмовите. Кога ќе речете, "Но, Иго не е првенствено за филм, и покрај врските на Мелиес", јас сум збунет. Признавам дека сметате дека многу елементи на Иго се премногу познати и макотрпни и полни со Спилбергови чуда-емоционални – не можам да направам ништо за да се расправам околу таа перцепција, што ја делат другите сомневачи на Иго. Понекогаш филмот значи да се шармира и очарува, а тоа не е за некои; вие го имате Хуго и јас ја имам Амели, иако мислам дека вториот, намерно вештачки, значи за нас да биде романтичен. (Наместо, да речеме, некоја ужасна механичка измислица погодна за продолжение на Saw.)<br/><br/>Но, да се каже дека Хуго не е првенствено за филмот? Ако не е за филмот, тогаш тоа е најбесмислената дискурзивна приказна за [што и да мислите дека е] што сум ја видел. Врската помеѓу Хуго и Мелиес е срцето на филмот, а во срцето на тоа не е само некаква врска помеѓу Plucky Orphan и Crusty Old Guy With A Heart Of Gold, туку заеднички афинитет за инженерирана магија - особено магијата на филмовите. Мислам дека Скорсезе и неговите соработници нашле начин да го изразат својот ентузијазам во раните денови на киното преку фантазија која е достапна за сите возрасти. Детската приказна исполнета со архетип е само кората тука; киното е пита. (Мммм... нога.)<br/><br/>Рекламирање<br/><br/>Што се однесува до љубопитниот случај на Бенџамин Батон, не гледам многу поврзаност, освен што се обидувам да се изложам како бранител на Бенџамин Батон како начин на оштетување на мојот кредибилитет. (Меѓу другото, како се екстрите на тој G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra Blu-ray?) Ви реков дека новиот татко во мене, кој е лишен од спиење, можеби е ранлив на Бенџамин Батон, но не можам да замислам време кога премисата за стареење во обратна насока нема да ме помести. И покрај тоа, не гледам како Бенџамин Батон многу се поврзува со Иго како филм за деца, бидејќи тоа е само мал дел од приказна која се протега на многу поголема патека.<br/><br/>Дали те убедив? Најверојатно не. Но, мило ми е да дознаам дека Иго не беше целосно лишен од магии за тебе. Секвенците на Мелиес, режисерот, се она што го стави Иго за мене - и во тоа, барем, можеме да споделиме малку филмска љубов.<br/><br/>Рекламирање<br/><br/>Таша: Не, не можам да кажам дека си ме убедил мене, колку што сум те убедил тебе. Невозможно е да се расправа со некого во висцерална љубов за нешто, и навистина треба да биде подеднакво невозможно да се разговара со некого од висцерална љубов. Воглавно, ми дозволивте да го видам Хуго во Скот-О-Визија, што е интересно искуство; барем сега сум благо убеден дека некако не успеавме да видиме сосема различни филмови кои некако имаа исто име и режисер.<br/><br/>Секако, имавме различни искуства и, по мое мислење, се фокусиравме на различни аспекти на продукцијата: сè уште не ја гледам темата „филмот е прекрасен“ како единствената нишка на филмот, колку што е една од премногу. "Бесмислено дискурсивно" речиси го покрива, иако јас би фрли во "често непотребно слатка и скапоцена" на врвот на тоа. Додека сте фокусирани на вкусното исполнување на питата во филмот, чувствувам дека таа пита беше покриена со фунта кристализиран шеќер, и мислам дека тоа прави разлика, без оглед на основната порака на филмот или неколку прекрасни сцени. Видете исто така Бенџамин Батон, кој не го спомнав само за да ве изневерам - навистина мислам дека имате повеќе сентиментална низа отколку што имам во однос на децата во кино, особено кога тие се користат повеќе како симболи на ранливост и невиност отколку како човечки ликови. Еј, знаете ли кој филм сосема нема симпатични широки очи макети кои носат надеж во циничен свет? G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra. Можеби ќе одам да ги гледам оние Blu-ray екстри. Можам да користам малку експлозив-инсулин за да ја надоместам слаткоста на Хуго. |
| "I hoped my daughter would be free from difficult and troubling times": Mee Mee's story as a refugee Mom<br/><br/>Hope in Times of Crisis: A Mother's Day Story<br/><br/>By Judith Santiago*<br/><br/>Mee Mee heard that the soldiers were coming. She took hold of her son and frantically joined the rest of the villagers who were running toward the Thai-Burmese border, where the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) was located. Her husband was in another village running in the opposite direction, Mee later learned. After the soldiers' pursuit ended, Mee returned home to her small village in Koechi, Burma.<br/><br/>During 1997-2000, Mee and thousands like her lived under the constant threat of violence from Burmese soldiers. Many people would take temporary refuge in the jungle, and return home to their village after soldiers left the area, just to do it all over again days later. About once a week, Mee and others would be on the move to avoid capture, rape, or death by soldiers.<br/><br/>During one incident, Mee's husband ran ahead of his wife to secure food for his family. Her husband was spotted by soldiers and shot. The bullet shattered a portion of his ribcage, leaving him severely wounded and in distress as he journeyed toward the jungle with his family for safety.<br/><br/>For three months, Mee's husband hid and moved the family with an exasperating wound at his side. He received no medical care, except for Mee's tending.<br/><br/>"I was afraid to return to Burma," Mee said through an interpreter. "I feared dying. I cried and cried every day," she continued.<br/><br/>Mee's husband eventually drew enough strength to walk five days toward a small village in Thailand where they learned the location of a hospital and a refugee camp. When Mee and her husband finally arrived at the hospital, he underwent immediate surgery and later recovered.<br/><br/>Symbol of Hope<br/><br/>Life in the jungle for those fleeing Burmese soldiers was indeed terrifying and difficult. Makeshift bamboo tents with only roof and floor coverings became suitable temporary dwellings. Many women including Mee gave birth to children in the jungle. Mee's then six-year-old son assisted in the delivery of his sister named Eh Ku Hser. Her name means love – cold – sweet. "Cold" in Burmese culture means so as to not pass through the fire of life, as heat represents troubled times.<br/><br/>"I hoped my daughter would be free from difficult and troubling times," said Mee. "I did not want her to go through what I had experienced," she continued.<br/><br/>For Mee, the birth of her daughter in the midst of darkness, torment and fear, was a symbol of hope for a new life to come. Hope in times of crisis, the very premise of the United Methodist Committee on Relief's (UMCOR) newly co-branded UMCOR-Prosperity Candle, is also the essence of that which candles shed light upon.<br/><br/>A New Beginning<br/><br/>With the help of UNHCR, hope for a new life did indeed materialize for Mee and her family when they resettled in West Springfield, Massachusetts. There, Mee met Moo Kho Paw, another woman who emigrated from Burma, and who was working at Prosperity Candle in Florence. The organization helps refugee women who have escaped areas of conflict rebuild their lives through the art of candle making. Moo Kho recommended that Mee join the organization, and Mee gladly accepted.<br/><br/>"I was excited to be out of the house," said Mee, "I was raised to believe that because I was a woman, my role was to remain at home and raise my family," she continued. "While many Burmese women want to do more for themselves, they are often encouraged to remain homemakers."<br/><br/>Today, Mee has plans to go into the candle-making business for herself and support her five children, but she expressed the need to learn English first.<br/><br/>"In the Thai refugee camp, we had education, but it was not so good," said Mee. "When I was a child, I wanted to go to school, but I was told to stay home because I was a woman. Now, I have hopes for my daughters to go to college and become doctors or policewomen," continued Mee.<br/><br/>Mee has struck an even balance in her life that she wishes others would have found—a simple, happy life where work, caring for family members and freedom of choice all have their place.<br/><br/>Support Refugee Women in the US<br/><br/>Share this Mother's Day story with your loved ones. And, when you purchase handmade candles by Mee, Moo Kho, and Naw, another Burmese refugee woman working at Prosperity Candle , know you are helping to support their livelihood as they rebuild their lives and those of their family members in the US. | „Се надевав дека ќерка ми ќе биде ослободена од тешките и вознемирувачки времиња“: Приказната на Ми Ми како мајка бегалка<br/><br/>Надеж во време на криза: Приказна за Денот на мајката<br/><br/>Од Џудит Сантјаго*<br/><br/>Ми Ми слушна дека војниците доаѓаат. Таа го зеде својот син и бесно им се придружи на останатите селани кои трчаа кон тајландско-бурманската граница, каде што се наоѓаше Канцеларијата на Високиот комесар на Обединетите нации за бегалци (УНХЦР). Нејзиниот сопруг бил во друго село кое трчало во спротивна насока, дознала подоцна Ми. Откако потерата на војниците завршила, Ми се вратила дома во своето мало село во Коечи, Бурма.<br/><br/>Во текот на 1997-2000, Ми и илјадници како неа живееле под постојана закана од насилство од страна на бурманските војници. Многу луѓе привремено се засолнувале во џунглата и се враќале дома откако војниците ја напуштиле областа, само за да го направат тоа повторно неколку дена подоцна. Околу еднаш неделно, Ми и другите ќе се движат за да избегнат заробување, силување или смрт од страна на војниците.<br/><br/>За време на еден инцидент, сопругот на Ми трчал пред неговата сопруга за да обезбеди храна за неговото семејство. Нејзиниот сопруг бил забележан од војници и застрелан. Куршумот му скршил дел од реброто, оставајќи го тешко повреден и во неволја додека патувал кон џунглата со своето семејство за безбедност.<br/><br/>Три месеци, сопругот на Ми се криеше и го преместуваше семејството со огорчена рана на неговата страна. Тој не доби медицинска помош, освен грижата за Ми.<br/><br/>„Се плашев да се вратам во Бурма“, рече Ми преку преведувач. „Се плашев да умрам. Плачев и плачев секој ден“, продолжи таа.<br/><br/>Сопругот на Ми на крајот добил доволно сила за да пешачи пет дена до едно мало село во Тајланд, каде што дознале за локацијата на болницата и кампот за бегалци. Кога Ми и нејзиниот сопруг конечно пристигнаа во болницата, тој веднаш беше подложен на операција и подоцна се опорави.<br/><br/>Симбол на надежта<br/><br/>Животот во џунглата за оние кои бегаат од бурманските војници навистина беше застрашувачки и тежок. Произведени шатори од бамбус со само покрив и подни облоги станаа соодветни привремени живеалишта. Многу жени, вклучувајќи ја и Ми, родија деца во џунглата. Тогашниот шестгодишен син на Ми помогна во испораката на неговата сестра по име Ех Ку Хсер. Нејзиното име значи љубов - ладно - слатко. "Студено" во бурманската култура значи да не помине низ огнот на животот, бидејќи топлината претставува тешки времиња.<br/><br/>"Се надевав дека мојата ќерка ќе биде ослободена од тешки и вознемирувачки времиња", рече Ми. "Не сакав таа да помине низ она што јас го доживеав", продолжи таа.<br/><br/>За Ми, раѓањето на нејзината ќерка во средината на темнината, маките и стравот, беше симбол на надежта за нов живот што доаѓа. Надежта во времиња на криза, самата премиса на Обединетиот методистички комитет за помош (UMCOR), ново ко-брендирана свеќа UMCOR-Prosperity, е исто така суштината на она на што свеќите фрлаат светлина.<br/><br/>Нов почеток<br/><br/>Со помош на УНХЦР, надежта за нов живот навистина се остварила за Ми и нејзиното семејство кога се преселиле во Западен Спрингфилд, Масачусетс. Таму, Ми се сретна со Му Ко Пав, уште една жена која емигрирала од Бурма, и која работела во Просперитет свеќа во Фиренца. Организацијата им помага на бегалките кои избегале од конфликтни области повторно да ги изградат своите животи преку уметноста на правење свеќи. Му Ко препорача Ми да се приклучи на организацијата, а Ми со задоволство го прифати.<br/><br/>„Бев возбудена што сум надвор од куќата“, рече Ми, „Пораснав да верувам дека бидејќи сум жена, мојата улога е да останам дома и да го подигнам моето семејство.“ Додека многу жени во Бурма сакаат да направат повеќе за себе, често се охрабруваат да останат домаќинки.<br/><br/>Денес, Ми има планови да се занимава со изработка на свеќи за себе и да ги издржува своите пет деца, но таа ја изрази потребата прво да научи англиски јазик.<br/><br/>„Во тајландскиот камп за бегалци имавме образование, но тоа не беше толку добро“, рече Ми. „Кога бев дете, сакав да одам на училиште, но ми беше речено да останам дома бидејќи бев жена. Сега се надевам дека моите ќерки ќе одат на колеџ и ќе станат доктори или полицајки“, вели Ми.<br/><br/>Ми постигна рамнотежа во својот живот што посакува другите да ја најдат – едноставен, среќен живот каде што работата, грижата за членовите на семејството и слободата на избор имаат свое место.<br/><br/>Поддршка за бегалците во САД<br/><br/>Споделете ја приказната за Денот на мајката со вашите најблиски. И, кога ќе купите рачно изработени свеќи од Ми, Му Ко и Нав, уште една жена од Бурмански бегалци која работи во „Просперитет свеќа“, знајте дека помагате да ги поддржите нивните животи додека тие повторно ги градат своите животи и животите на членовите на нивните семејства во САД. |
| The Precedency Essay<br/><br/>1562 words - 7 pages<br/><br/>Affirmative action is a government policy that gives opportunities to minorities, women, and any group who has been the victim of discrimination in the past. Affirmative action is the outcome of the 1960's Civil Rights movement, growing out of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 which outlawed discrimination based on race, ethnicity, or gender. It was the 1978 Supreme Court decision, The Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, which allowed for the use of race-based preferences as a means of fostering diversity, allowing affirmative action to be used in admissions policies. It was created with the intention to provide equal opportunities for members of minority groups in education and ...view middle of the document...<br/><br/>However, according to a 2007 report by the Pew Research Center, support for affirmative action among the American public has actually increased substantiallyin recent years, climbing from 58% in 1995 to 70% in 2007. Supporters of affirmative action make many arguments in support of affirmative action, in the hopes of getting others to see the genuine good that affirmative actin policies bring to our society. Supporters believe that affirmative action is more of a process rather than an admissions policy. Colleges and universities take the extra initiative to reach out to minority groups, encouraging them to apply. Colleges and universities offer additional financial aid and provide on-campus resources to help better the student's college education. Supporters also note the rising number of minority applications to colleges and universities due in part to affirmative action policies.<br/>Statistics have proven that when affirmative action is eliminated, such as when it was at Berkley College and UCLA in 1998, the minority student admissions fell 61 percent and 36 percent respectively, proving that affirmative action plays a major role in a minority students college admissions process. Affirmative action supporters also believe that diversity in higher education provides a better educational atmosphere for all students, personally and intellectually. If affirmative action were to be eliminated, there would be fewer minority students enrolled in colleges, causing diversity to be fairly slim. Affirmative action policies are also necessary in order to compensate for centuries of racial, economic, and social oppression. Individuals with a higher socioeconomic status have more opportunities than those of lower socioeconomic backgrounds. Supporters believe that certain racial or ethnic groups are disadvantaged because they are frequently in lower income households and consequently are not exposed to the same resources as students from higher socioeconomic classes. Advocates support the notion of competition between students based on merit, but argue that affirmative action compensates for economic differences. College graduates, who have benefitted from affirmative action, have also said that they received better jobs, earned more money, and overall live better lives because of the fortunate opportunities they received through affirmative action.<br/>Supporters of affirmative action continuously stress the severe importance of affirmative action, considering its contributions to enhancing both the college experience and society in general. However, opponents of affirmative action believe that the time has come to end affirmative action. Opponents believe affirmative action was created to ensure fair admission practices to bring change to a long period of racial discrimination. They believe the policy is outdated."It's time to pull the plug on race-based decision making," says Ward Connerly, a Sacramento, California businessman and lead organizer of...<br/><br/>Find Another Essay On The Precedency<br/><br/>754 words - 4 pages<br/>of the burden to continue prospering.

Афирмативната акција е резултат на движењето за граѓански права од 1960 година, кое произлегува од Законот за граѓански права од 1964 година, кој ја забранува дискриминацијата врз основа на раса, етничка припадност или пол. Тоа беше одлуката на Врховниот суд од 1978 година, The Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, која овозможи употреба на расни преференции како средство за поттикнување на разновидност, овозможувајќи афирмативна акција да се користи во политиките за прием. Таа е создадена со намера да се обезбедат еднакви можности за припадниците на малцинските групи во образованието и ...<br/><br/>Сепак, според извештајот од 2007 година од Истражувачкиот центар Пју, поддршката за афирмативна акција меѓу американската јавност всушност значително се зголеми во последниве години, од 58% во 1995 година до 70% во 2007 година. Поддржувачите на афирмативната акција прават многу аргументи во поддршка на афирмативната акција, со надеж дека ќе ги натераат другите да го видат вистинското добро што политиките за афирмативна акција го носат во нашето општество. Поддржувачите веруваат дека афирмативното дејствување е повеќе процес отколку политика за прием. Колеџите и универзитетите преземаат дополнителна иницијатива за да допрат до малцинските групи, поттикнувајќи ги да аплицираат. Колеџите и универзитетите нудат дополнителна финансиска помош и обезбедуваат ресурси на кампусот за да помогнат подобро образование на колеџот на студентот. Поддржувачите, исто така, го забележуваат зголемувањето на бројот на малцинските апликации за колеџи и универзитети, делумно поради политиките за афирмативна акција.<br/>Статистиката докажа дека кога афирмативната акција е елиминирана, како што беше кога беше на колеџот Беркли и UCLA во 1998 година, приемот на малцинските студенти падна за 61% и 36% соодветно, докажувајќи дека афирмативната акција игра голема улога во процесот на прием на малцинските студенти на колеџ. Поддржувачите на афирмативната акција, исто така, веруваат дека разновидноста во високото образование обезбедува подобра образовна атмосфера за сите студенти, лично и интелектуално. Ако афирмативната акција биде елиминирана, ќе има помалку малцински студенти запишани на колеџи, предизвикувајќи разновидност да биде прилично тенка. Политиките за афирмативно дејствување се исто така неопходни за да се компензираат вековите на расно, економско и социјално угнетување. Поединците со повисок социоекономски статус имаат повеќе можности од оние со пониско социоекономско потекло. Поддржувачите веруваат дека одредени расни или етнички групи се во неповолна положба бидејќи тие често се во домаќинства со пониски приходи и затоа не се изложени на истите ресурси како учениците од повисоки социо-економски класи. Застапниците го поддржуваат концептот на конкуренција меѓу студентите врз основа на заслуги, но тврдат дека афирмативното дејствување ги компензира економските разлики. Дипломираните студенти, кои имаат корист од афирмативна акција, исто така, велат дека добиле подобри работни места, заработиле повеќе пари и живеат подобри животи поради среќните можности што ги добиле преку афирмативна акција.<br/>Поддржувачите на афирмативната акција постојано ја нагласуваат големата важност на афирмативната акција, со оглед на нејзиниот придонес за подобрување на искуството на колеџот и општеството во целина. Сепак, противниците на афирмативното дејствување веруваат дека дојде време да се стави крај на афирмативното дејствување. Противниците веруваат дека афирмативното дејствување е создадено за да се обезбедат фер практики за прием за да се донесат промени до долг период на расна дискриминација.

За професорот по физика и астрономија Тимир Дата, тоа беше момент за повторно создавање на познатиот експеримент од 1919 година кој помогна да се потврди теоријата на Алберт Ајнштајн за општата релативност.<br/>Хартстоун-Роуз, вонреден професор на Факултетот за медицина и помошен научник во зоолошката градина Ривербанкс, тоа беше можност да се проучува чудно однесување на животните.<br/><br/>Студискиот професор по уметност и истражувач Крис Робинсон ја поврза уметноста и науката преку неговата уникатна ласерска инсталација Southern Lights, која дебитираше на 19 август. Големата инсталација, која ќе се протега низ реката Конгари во близина на мостот Блосом, е планирана за идниот долгорочен дисплеј, така што повеќе посетители ќе можат да уживаат во уникатното искуство со ласерски зрак.<br/><br/>Распоред на епски настани<br/><br/>Домот на најдолгиот период на целосно затемнување на источниот брег бил значаен.<br/>Затоа, низ целиот град, можете да уживате во галаксијата на настани поврзани со затемнување во деновите пред главниот настан. Универзитетот на Јужна Каролина Колумбија<br/>Кампусот беше домаќин на голем број на бесплатни, јавни програми кои започнуваат на 17 август.<br/><br/>Во петок, 18-ти август, соларниот физичар д-р Сарбани Басу, катедра за астрономија на Универзитетот Јејл, разговараше за историјата на помрачувањата на Сонцето и што човештвото научи од нив на јавно предавање.<br/><br/>На нед., 20 август, посетителите на кампусот учествуваа во серија на бесплатни, 30-минутни разговори од USC факултет и посети научници Рамеш Капур, Херардо Васкез, Џејмс Овердуин и Кристин Симунак.<br/><br/>Серијата се одржа во Сверинген Инженеринг Центар и беше домаќин на експерти кои дискутираа за улогата на затемнувањата во науката и општеството и за тоа како затемнувањата влијаеле врз митовите и легендите низ историјата.<br/><br/>Посетителите на Spirit Communications Park на денот на затемнувањето беа поканети да ги истражуваат степените на здравје со UofSC на фестивалот iMAGINE STEM. Овој целосен ден на забава вклучуваше интерактивни STEM експонати (наука, технологија, инженерство и математика) од UofSC и други организации. Билетите исто така вклучуваа 13:05 часот.<br/>Columbia Fireflies vs. Rome Braves игра и целосно затемнување на паркот.<br/><br/>За оние кои претпочитаа да ја победат топлината и да го гледаат затемнувањето внатре, им понудивме гледање во живо на Еклипс Мегакаст на НАСА ТВ во неколку области низ кампусот Колумбија.<br/><br/>Различни експерти посети локации низ кампусот за да споделат како затемнувањата се ткаени во нашата наука, култура, историја и уметност. Алисон Марш, Стивен Родни, Мајкл Вајзенбург, Скот Вајт, Варша Кулкарни, Нејт Карнс и Женлонг Ли беа домаќини на 20-минутни јавни дискусии кои водеа до затемнувањето.<br/><br/>Одделот за физика и астрономија работел на 10 отворени и 5 затворени станици за набљудување низ кампусот со телескопи, активности и / или видео преноси во живо од НАСА. Гледачите можеа да го изберат своето искуство со затемнување со пристап до стручни дискусии и телескопска технологија или забавни активности како диск голф и занаети за семејството.<br/><br/>Натуралистот во резиденцијата на УСК, Руди Манке, ги посети гледачите на историската Потковица за да ја сподели природата на затемнувањето на Сонцето, што доведе до 2,5 минути на вкупноста која започнува во 14:41 часот.<br/><br/>Откако сонцето целосно повторно се појави, универзитетот беше домаќин на Eclipse прием за растечките средношколци и претстојните дипломирани студенти.<br/><br/>Во доцна попладне, Дарла Мур школа за бизнис беше домаќин на бесплатен, јавен говор на д-р Крег Робертс, истакнат професор и висок физичар во Аргон Националната лабораторија, една од националните лаборатории на Министерството за енергија на САД за наука и инженерски истражувања. Во неговата дискусија „Поставување на Божјата честичка за одмор“, д-р Робертс дискутирал за Хигсовиот бозон и зошто не може да се користи за да се идентификува изворот на повеќе од 98% од видливата маса на универзумот.<br/><br/>Големиот ден конечно дојде до крај на стадионот Вилијамс Брајс каде што посетителите можеа да уживаат во ѕвездите на универзитетот. Отворена пракса на фудбалскиот тим на 2017 Gamecock беше совршен крај на феноменален ден.<br/><br/>Осветлување на историјата<br/><br/>Посетителите на кампусот можеа да се спојат заедно со експертите за затемнување и сите во близина и далеку беа поканети да го споделат ова искуство еднаш во животот. Дознајте повеќе за тоа како го поздравивме овој историски настан:<br/><br/>Официјална локација на НАСА<br/><br/>Бевме почестени да бидеме именувани за Официјална локација за набљудување од НАСА. Гледачите на нашите 15 станици за набљудување на кампусот уживаа во пристапот до експерти поврзани со затемнување и други образовни можности додека безбедно уживаат во затемнувањето на сонцето. |
| Birthdays<br/><br/>Some people in your organisation may not wish to give you their birth date. Infoodle allows you to remove the birth year of a person! To do this:<br/><br/>When Adding a Person click the Hide Year button to remove the year of birth for the person.<br/><br/>Alternatively, when Editing a Person find the date of birth field for your site. Click the Edit button, then click Hide Year and save.<br/><br/>Easy as that!<br/><br/>Note: A person who has their birth year removed won't appear in any reports regarding an age criteria and is classed as an adult because their date of birth is actually set to 1902! The date of birth field is normally found in the information section but may have been<br/>moved under a different tab by your administrator. | Родендени<br/><br/>Некои луѓе во вашата организација можеби не сакаат да ви го дадат датумот на раѓање. Infoodle ви овозможува да ја отстраните годината на раѓање на некое лице! За да го направите ова:<br/><br/>Кога додавате лице, кликнете на копчето Скриј година за да ја отстраните годината на раѓање на лицето.<br/><br/>Алтернативно, кога уредување лице најдете датум на раѓање поле за вашиот сајт. Кликнете на копчето Уредување, а потоа кликнете Скриј година и зачувај.<br/><br/>Полека, полека!<br/><br/>Забелешка: Лицето кое ја отстранило годината на раѓање нема да се појави во никакви извештаи во врска со критериумите за возраст и е класифицирано како возрасен, бидејќи датумот на раѓање е всушност поставен на 1902 година! Датумот на раѓање обично се наоѓа во делот за информации, но можеби бил преместен под друг таб од страна на вашиот администратор. |
| Combinations<br/><br/>Combinations Are defenses against a punch, choreographed responses to different types of attacks. They have many names across the martial arts but (in my experience) every art has a version of them. This makes them different than forms because there are plenty of martial arts that have no forms. What makes there partner exercises so universal? Why practice a specific response when (in reality) timing, type of attack, size of the attacker, and a hundred other factors will make it so you never use that entire choreographed response? And finally, how can we practice for a real defense situation and avoid injury at the same time?<br/><br/>The universality of combinations is impressive, to say the least. Our style of Kenpo karate has a list of 108 combos that can be learned. (Most students only learn 20-30 though) In Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu you spend whole classes practicing arm bars and chokes, learning every subtlety to the move while your partner offers little to no resistance. Every boxer has spent hours in front of the bag and/or mirror throwing the same combination of punches until their body moves by reflex alone. Combinations are universal because we have no better way to introduce movement and then practice the subtle positions required to make them work. Hitting a small pressure point through clothing takes A LOT of practice, catching an arm bar with control requires a carefully placed hip and a sneaky setup, and a great combination is only useful if you can through it from a balanced and protected position. Can you think of a better way to gain these skills?<br/><br/>There is any number of factors that determine how you respond to an attack and whether in a sparring match or in a fight, I have NEVER used a full combination in my defense. Why, then, do we spend hours practicing them? We practice these choreographed responses because the objective is not to pull combination 8 out every time you see a hook punch but to show you one way of blocking it and then a possible way to follow it up. I have never chosen to use combination 3 in a reality situation but the block is one of my go-to moves. Combinations add tools to the toolbox they do not fix the car.<br/><br/>The last question is a question of safety. If we practice for the sake of reality we need to replicate reality. How do we prevent injury while doing so? When it comes down to it, it's about building trust. We start slow and learn to trust that we have control over ourselves. We learn to trust our partners have control as well. In more time we learn to trust our control over our partner and (a little scarier) we learn to trust our partner's control over us. In the end (with a lot of practice) you can move are full speed, tossing your partner, and being thrown without fear of injury.<br/><br/>Combinations are universal for a reason; they are practiced so they can be dissected into their parts, and we stay safe by starting slow and building trust. As with everything else in the martial arts, combinations have many reasons behind their practice and execution. | Комбинации<br/><br/>Комбинациите се одбрана против удар, кореографирани одговори на различни видови напади. Тие имаат многу имиња низ боречки вештини, но (од мое искуство) секоја уметност има верзија на нив. Ова ги прави различни од форми, бидејќи има многу боречки вештини кои немаат форми. Што го прави партнерот вежби толку универзална? Зошто да практикувате специфичен одговор кога (во реалноста) тајмингот, видот на нападот, големината на напаѓачот и сто други фактори ќе го направат тоа така што никогаш нема да го користите целиот кореографиран одговор? И на крај, како можеме да вежбаме за вистинска одбранбена ситуација и да избегнеме повреда во исто време?<br/><br/>Универзалноста на комбинациите е импресивна, да се каже најмалку. Нашиот стил на Кенпо карате има листа од 108 комбинации кои можат да се научат. (Повеќето студенти учат само 20-30 иако) Во бразилскиот Џиу-Џицу ќе поминат цели часови вежбање рака барови и задави, учење на секој суптилност на движење, додека вашиот партнер нуди малку или никаков отпор. Секој боксер поминал часови пред торбата и/или огледалото фрлајќи ја истата комбинација на удари сè додека неговото тело не се движи само со рефлекс. Комбинациите се универзални бидејќи немаме подобар начин да ги воведеме движењата и потоа да ги практикуваме суптилните позиции потребни за да ги натераме да работат. Удирањето на мала точка на притисок низ облеката бара многу вежбање, фаќањето на шипка за рака со контрола бара внимателно поставен колкот и подмолно поставување, а одличната комбинација е корисна само ако можете да ја поминете од избалансирана и заштитена позиција. Можете ли да смислите подобар начин да ги стекнете овие вештини?<br/><br/>Постојат голем број на фактори кои одредуваат како ќе реагирате на напад и дали во спаринг натпревар или во борба, јас НИКОГАШ не сум користел целосна комбинација во мојата одбрана. Зошто, тогаш, трошиме часови вежбајќи ги? Ние ги практикуваме овие кореографирани одговори, бидејќи целта не е да се извлече комбинација 8 надвор секој пат кога ќе видите кука удар, но да ви покаже еден начин на блокирање, а потоа можен начин да го следат. Никогаш не сум избрал да ја користам комбинацијата 3 во реалноста, но блокот е еден од моите потези. Комбинации додаваат алатки во кутијата со алатки, тие не го поправаат автомобилот.<br/><br/>Последното прашање е прашање на безбедност. Ако вежбаме за доброто на реалноста, треба да ја реплицираме реалноста. Како да спречиме повреда додека го правиме тоа? Кога станува збор за тоа, станува збор за градење доверба. Почнуваме бавно и учиме да веруваме дека имаме контрола над себе. Учиме да веруваме дека нашите партнери имаат контрола, како и. Во повеќе време учиме да веруваме во нашата контрола над нашиот партнер и (мало пострашно) учиме да веруваме во контролата на нашиот партнер над нас. На крајот (со многу пракса) можете да се движите со полна брзина, фрлање на вашиот партнер и да бидете фрлени без страв од повреда.<br/><br/>Комбинациите се универзални со причина; тие се практикуваат за да можат да се сецираат на нивните делови, а ние остануваме безбедни со тоа што почнуваме бавно и градиме доверба. Како и со сè друго во боречките вештини, комбинациите имаат многу причини за нивната пракса и извршување. |
