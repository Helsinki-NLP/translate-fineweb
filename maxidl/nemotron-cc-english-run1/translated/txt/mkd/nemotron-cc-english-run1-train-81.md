| Forty-nine years ago today, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act of 1965.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Nearly a century ago, the 15th Amendment to the Constitution stated, "The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of race, color or previous condition of servitude." And nearly a century before that, our nation's founding fathers set in motion the great experiment of American democracy by declaring that "all men are created equal."<br/><br/>The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was a belated acknowledgment that even in America, our foundational ideals carry little weight if not protected by the rule of law. That's why Section 2 of the 15th Amendment granted Congress the "power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation."<br/><br/>And indeed, the codified language of the Voting Rights Act was able to achieve what the Reconstruction-era Congress and Thomas Jefferson could not. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act—and the civil rights movement from which they emerged—served as the catalyst for a dramatic increase in the opportunity for black Americans to participate in the democratic process.<br/><br/>For example, only 6.7 percent of eligible black Mississippians were registered to vote as of 1962; by 1969 that figure had reached 66.5 percent. Today, Mississippi has more black elected officials than any other state.<br/><br/>The protections put in place by the Voting Rights Act were long overdue when they were passed, representative of the arduous struggle with which they were achieved. But unthinkably, these protections are now under assault, jeopardizing the progress our nation worked so hard to achieve.<br/><br/>Last year, in the case of Shelby County v. Holder, the U.S. Supreme Court gutted a key component of the Voting Rights Act that enabled prior federal review to ensure nondiscrimination before any new voting law went into effect.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Sadly, the response of Republican leaders has been to do nothing. Sen. Ted Cruz and Gov. Rick Perry went out of their way to praise the Supreme Court's decision. Sen. Rand Paul dismissed the continued necessity of the Voting Rights Act by noting, "We have an African-American president."<br/><br/>While the election of President Barack Obama was indeed a historic milestone, it is dangerous to think that it absolves us from remaining vigilant against the lingering consequences of our nation's past. The haste with which states have moved to enact voting restrictions is confirmation that the protections put in place by Section 4 are still necessary.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Republican governors have signed strict photo-identification restrictions into law as the solution to a virtually nonexistent problem of voter impersonation, disproportionately hurting women, young people, working families and the African-American community. It's disingenuous for Republicans like Paul to seek the votes of these communities when they believe "there's nothing wrong with" putting restrictions in place that make it harder for these constituencies to vote.<br/><br/>Republicans have also sought to restrict early-voting periods, including the Sunday before Election Day, when African-American churches have had great success with Souls to the Polls programs.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>These restrictions represent a callous effort by Republicans to make voting harder, based on narrow, short-term political calculations that Republicans can win elections by shrinking the size of the electorate.<br/><br/>Democrats have a very different mission when it comes to voting: to ensure that every eligible voter can register, that every registered voter can vote and that every vote is accurately counted.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>The Democratic National Committee's Voter Expansion Project reflects our belief that greater voter participation strengthens our nation and our democracy. We'll continue to use our unmatched institutional knowledge to protect voting rights against legislation and tactics that would attempt to suppress the vote. And because the best defense is a good offense, we're also working to expand the vote by deploying our technology and data resources to register new voters.<br/><br/>On this anniversary, one of the best ways we can honor those who struggled—and in some cases gave their very lives—for the legislation's passage is for Republicans in Congress to join Democrats in passing the Voting Rights Amendment Act to restore the promise of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Democrat, represents Florida's 23rd Congressional District in the United States Congress.

Џонсон го потпиша Актот за гласачко право од 1965 година.<br/><br/>Рекламирање<br/><br/>Пред речиси еден век, 15-тиот амандман на Уставот гласеше: „Правото на граѓаните на Соединетите Држави да гласаат не може да биде одбиено или скратено од Соединетите Држави или од која било држава поради раса, боја или претходна состојба на ропство“. И речиси еден век пред тоа, татковците-основачи на нашата нација го започнаа големиот експеримент на американската демократија со изјавата дека „сите луѓе се создадени еднакви“.<br/><br/>Законот за гласачки права од 1965 година беше задоцнето признавање дека дури и во Америка, нашите основни идеали имаат мала тежина ако не се заштитени со владеење на правото. Ова е причината зошто член 2 од 15-тиот амандман му даде на Конгресот „овластување да го спроведе овој член со соодветно законодавство“.<br/><br/>И навистина, кодифицираниот јазик на Законот за гласачки права беше во можност да го постигне она што Конгресот од ерата на реконструкцијата и Томас Џеферсон не можеа. Законот за граѓански права од 1964 година и Законот за гласачки права - и движењето за граѓански права од кои тие произлегоа - служеа како катализатор за драматично зголемување на можноста за црните Американци да учествуваат во демократскиот процес.<br/><br/>На пример, само 6,7 проценти од квалификуваните црни Мисисипи биле регистрирани да гласаат од 1962 година; до 1969 година таа бројка достигнала 66.5 проценти. Денес, Мисисипи има повеќе црни избрани функционери од која било друга држава.<br/><br/>Заштитите воведени со Законот за гласачки права одамна беа донесени, претставувајќи ја тешката борба со која беа постигнати. Но, незамисливо, овие заштитни мерки сега се под напад, загрозувајќи го напредокот на кој нашата нација толку напорно работеше за да го постигне.<br/><br/>Минатата година, во случајот Шелби Каунти против Холдер, Врховниот суд на САД ја уништи клучната компонента на Законот за гласачки права, што овозможи претходна федерална ревизија за да се обезбеди недискриминација пред да стапи на сила секој нов закон за гласање.<br/><br/>Рекламирање<br/><br/>Сенаторот Тед Круз и гувернерот Рик Пери ја фалеа одлуката на Врховниот суд. Сенаторот Ренд Пол ја отфрли потребата за Законот за гласачки права, истакнувајќи: „Имаме афро-американски претседател“.<br/><br/>„Иако изборот на претседателот Барак Обама навистина беше историска пресвртница, опасно е да се мисли дека нè ослободува од тоа да останеме внимателни на долготрајните последици од минатото на нашата нација. Брзината со која државите се движат да донесат ограничувања на гласањето е потврда дека заштитата воведена во делот 4 сè уште е неопходна.<br/><br/>Рекламирање<br/><br/>Републиканските гувернери потпишаа строги ограничувања за фото-идентификација во законот како решение за речиси непостоечкиот проблем на имитирање на гласачите, непропорционално повредувајќи ги жените, младите, работните семејства и афроамериканската заедница. За републиканците како Пол е невистинито да бараат гласови од овие заедници кога веруваат дека „нема ништо лошо во“ воведувањето на ограничувања кои им отежнуваат на овие изборни единици да гласаат.<br/><br/>Републиканците, исто така, се обидоа да ги ограничат предвремените периоди на гласање, вклучувајќи ја и неделата пред денот на изборите, кога црквите на Афроамериканците имаа голем успех со програмите за гласање.<br/><br/>Рекламирање<br/><br/>Овие ограничувања претставуваат бездушен напор од страна на републиканците да го направат гласањето потешко, врз основа на тесни, краткорочни политички пресметки дека републиканците можат да победат на изборите со намалување на големината на електоратот.<br/><br/>Демократите имаат сосема поинаква мисија кога станува збор за гласање: да обезбедат секој гласач да може да се регистрира, секој регистриран гласач да може да гласа и секој глас да се брои точно.<br/><br/>Рекламирање<br/><br/>Проектот за проширување на изборите на Демократскиот национален комитет го одразува нашето убедување дека поголемото гласачко учество ја зајакнува нашата нација и нашата демократија. Ќе продолжиме да го користиме нашето неспоредливо институционално знаење за да го заштитиме правото на глас против законодавството и тактиките кои ќе се обидат да го потиснат гласањето. И бидејќи најдобрата одбрана е добар напад, ние исто така работиме на проширување на гласањето со распоредување на нашата технологија и податоци за да регистрираме нови гласачи.<br/><br/>На оваа годишнина, еден од најдобрите начини на кои можеме да им оддадеме почит на оние кои се бореа – и во некои случаи ги дадоа своите животи – бидејќи усвојувањето на законот е за републиканците во Конгресот да се приклучат на демократите во донесувањето на амандманот на Законот за гласачки права за да се врати ветувањето на Законот за гласачки права од 1965 година.<br/><br/>Рекламирање<br/><br/>Деби Васерман Шулц, демократ, го претставува 23-от конгресен округ на Флорида во Конгресот на САД.

| Q&A: Vatican safeguarding expert Fr Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>13 June 2021<br/><br/>Fr Hans Zollner SJ. Image: Australian Jesuits.<br/><br/>The President of the Centre for Child Protection at the Gregorian University in Rome, and a member of the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors, Fr Hans Zollner SJ, was in Australia in 2018 to speak to Catholic ministry leaders and survivors.<br/><br/>Michael McVeigh from Jesuit Communications sat down with him during the visit to explore how the Church is responding to the abuse crisis internationally, and what can be learned from our experiences in Australia.<br/><br/>MM: This is your third trip to Australia. You've visited quite a few other countries to see how the Church is responding to abuse around the world. Can you give us some idea of what the global picture looks like?<br/><br/>Fr Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>HZ: My understanding, after having visited about 50 countries on five or six continents, is that the Church is really starting to move over the last couple of years on the issue of doing justice to victims, of listening to them, and doing whatever can be done in terms of safeguarding.<br/><br/>I was with the Jesuit Provincials from all over Africa at the end of April, and the President of the Jesuit Assistancy of Africa and Madagascar is very much committed and dedicated to this. He has put up a thorough action plan for formation and for introducing guidelines all over the place. It's a very considerate and very deliberate effort to do whatever can be done to be proactively engaged as Jesuits in Africa — in a continent where until a few years ago all of this was a foreign language.<br/><br/>One of the challenges of trying to develop this global approach is that you're dealing with so many cultures, and so many different understandings. How do you bring this together and try to provide training and support religious communities tackling these issues?<br/><br/>This is one of the major questions we have. I think what I can do is stimulate discussion, stimulate reflection, and prepare people as much as possible so that they can do the groundwork.<br/><br/>The Centre for Child Protection at the Gregorian University does not pretend to have the response to every question. Not only because we don't know the specific contexts — we might know a few of them, but we're talking about thousands of cultures, we're talking about hundreds of languages, we're talking about very diverse legal backgrounds. It varies even sometimes within one country, such as Australia where you have states within the Commonwealth of Australia that have different laws than other states.<br/><br/>I am somebody who tries to elicit and stimulate discussion and reflection. I'm also very happy to listen to people.<br/><br/>You mentioned the need to listen and support victims in being heard. We've obviously had the Royal Commission here in Australia, but what are some of the other ways that you've seen that the voices of victims are being supported around the world?<br/><br/>In France there is one diocese that has established what they call 'The Listening Space'. There, victims can come forward and they can express themselves. The bishop is present. It's an open space in which people who have been hurt tremendously are free at least to express what they want to ask from the Church leadership etc.<br/><br/>There are other places in the USA or in other countries where victims have been invited by dioceses, by Provinces, by the leadership of the Church, to come forward. I have to say that overall I think there is a good will, and there are more people like bishops and provincials who listen to victims than we know. But there is no one model of giving victims not only the space to express themselves and be listened to, but also to engage actively in Church development.<br/><br/>In terms of setting up spaces for support for victims, what are some of the things you've seen that could really help — and that we could be considering here in Australia?<br/><br/>One of the major points that many victims bring up is, 'Can't we have, within parish settings, within schools settings, a regular conversation going on that includes survivors of abuse as regular members of a committee, a commission, a sounding board, a feedback group or something like that?' So that this voice is not only brought in on a specific occasion, or where a person feels like he or she is at a point to be able to speak out about it, but [is heard] on a regular basis — build that voice into the system.<br/><br/>That will help all of us. It will help survivors and victims because they will feel welcome and appreciated in the specific experience, and in the specific life challenges, that they went through. Secondly it will help the community at large, because we can at least make ourselves more and more sensitive to what the concerns and specific needs of survivors are — that can also talk to the needs of young people.<br/><br/>M: We have strong groups of survivors here in Australia who have been able to support each other through that process. But what you're saying is that we need some way of supporting those groups, and supporting those people, through our own institutions as well?<br/><br/>And I think we need to be creative. It will work for one school and one parish and one diocese in one way, and for others in a different way. Because the survivors with whom I am in constant contact, they have quite similar requests, and similar experiences in regard to being welcomed in the Church or not — feeling thrown out or dismissed. But they have also among themselves quite different expectations. So I have learned that you have also to be very forthcoming in accepting the differences in what this specific group, or this specific survivor, wants, requests and needs.<br/><br/>M: Survivors talk about wanting to have their stories heard and acknowledged. We've had the Royal Commission here in Australia, which provided an independent process where victims could come forward. Is there a need for something like that in terms of a truth, justice and reconciliation process for the Church internationally?<br/><br/>H: Yes, I think there is a need for that internationally. But I think first every local church needs to do its own homework. I don't see it happening very soon that some such council or commission would be established to look into this area for the whole Church. The Church has a membership of 1.3 billion people, and is present in 190 countries, with all kinds of differences in expectations concerning psychological, spiritual and financial support.<br/><br/>There is one thing that I have come across consistently in communicating with, working with and listening to victims, and that is that they want to be listened to. So if there was the feeling that victims were constantly being listened to — in Rome and elsewhere — I think that would give a great relief to many victims.<br/><br/>I think [Pope Francis'] concern, especially with regard to your question, is that the local churches do whatever they can so that victims will be listened to in that particular country. I have a list of people who want to speak to the Holy Father directly, and physically it is impossible. I was there in 2014 to translate for two German survivors who were chosen with two Irish and two English survivors when he received the six of them at home. He took the whole morning listening to them one after the other. For each one, he was there for 40 to 45 minutes. Were he to do this for every survivor he couldn't sleep anymore.<br/><br/>His example is modelling for the whole Catholic Church the way victims and survivors are received, welcomed and listened to. I think if the bishops and the provincials in this world, in all countries, followed his example, many survivors would be really appreciative of that.<br/><br/>Archbishop Diarmud Martin was recently quoted just before the World Meeting of Families, about the Pontifical Commission, saying that it's too small as it's currently set up to achieve what it needs to achieve. What's your take on that? Does the Church need to be putting more resources into how it's overseeing those issues?<br/><br/>At the moment we are 16 members from basically all continents, and the major language groups. We represent a variety of disciplines and professions, and the purpose of the commission — as the statutes that have just been promulgated state — is to provide counsel to the Holy Father.<br/><br/>A common misunderstanding about the commission is first that we deal with cases of allegations. That is not the case. We have no juridical or administrative power in regards to cases, because when it comes to allegations of abuse the tribunals and procedure are set.<br/><br/>A second misunderstanding is that we promote, directly, things on the ground. Our first and foremost goal is that we advise the Holy Father on issues.<br/><br/>So from my point of view, yes, we need to invest more. But we need to invest more on the local level, and we need to make sure that the proposals from the Pontifical Commission are forwarded to the Holy Father — which normally the President does — and then there is a follow-up process that reflects what we have given as our advice.<br/><br/>In Australia, Catholic Professional Standards Limited is overseeing the Church's response and providing guidelines and support for ensuring all the institutions in the Church are child-safe institutions. Is there a need for some kind of organisational support from Rome for those bishops and dioceses that are struggling to form these institutions and provide safeguarding in those dioceses?<br/><br/>I think ultimately the commission will develop in that line. They are now in the process of hiring experts in those areas.<br/><br/>I think the Church needs to understand that the local churches can learn from each other mutually. And my understanding has always been — and I think the Holy Father has reminded us — that the Church will not function as a centralised company. It does not work like that, effectively. Every bishop, every bishops conference, has, to some extent, its life on its own. What we need to learn more is to open channels of mutual communication.<br/><br/>There are a number of things that people blame for abuse in the Church. As a priest and a psychologist, and as someone who has met and worked with survivors, what are your thoughts on that issue?<br/><br/>I think the question of where does abuse come from is the most important one, and the Pope has addressed that in his letter to the people of God published on 20 August. He says in the first paragraph, and repeats it over and over again, that the question of sexual abuse is always linked — or almost always linked — not only to the question of abuse of power, but also to the abuse of conscience.<br/><br/>So the real fundamental question of abuse is much more complex than just [the question of] sexuality — be it heterosexual or homosexual. It's a power issue, and there we have to really work on the question of how do we understand priesthood, how to we understand bishophood, how do we understand and live out our ministries? What are the boundaries?<br/><br/>That's why I'm very happy that the Jesuit Province in Australia is establishing a Code of Conduct. Because we don't talk only about sexual abuse of minors. We talk about sexual abuse of adults, and we talk about abuse in other ways — like abuse of conscience, where you dictate to someone what you think, or you pretend to know by God, and you can tell another person, 'You need to do that', against the conscience of that person.<br/><br/>Many people think celibacy produces abuse. As I always say, celibacy as such is not cause for abusing — otherwise how do we explain that 99.9 per cent of all abusers do not live a celibate life, and how do we explain that 95 or 96 per cent of all priests do not abuse minors? But, celibacy, or a vow of chastity, that is not really integrated, that is not really lived out properly — yes, that produces a problem. Sometimes people take to drinking, sometime they take to gambling, and sometimes they take to sexual misconduct, with adults and with minors.<br/><br/>The real question about this is how do we deal with the notion of religious spiritual power with which priests and bishops are invested? How can theology help us to understand, and maybe how can sociology, psychology, or business administration help us to define the limits of power, and the necessity of keeping your boundaries | Прашања и одговори: Експертот за заштита на Ватикан отец Ханс Золнер СЈ<br/><br/>13 јуни 2021<br/><br/>Отец Ханс Золнер СЈ. Слика: Австралиски језуити.<br/><br/>Претседателот на Центарот за заштита на децата на Грегоријанскиот универзитет во Рим и член на Папската комисија за заштита на малолетниците, Ханс Золнер СЈ, беше во Австралија во 2018 година за да разговара со лидерите на католичкото министерство и преживеаните.<br/><br/>Мајкл Меквеј од Језуитските комуникации седна со него за време на посетата за да истражи како Црквата реагира на кризата на злоупотреба на меѓународно ниво и што може да се научи од нашите искуства во Австралија.<br/><br/>ММ: Ова е вашето трето патување во Австралија. Сте посетиле доста други земји за да видите како Црквата реагира на злоупотреба низ целиот свет. Можете ли да ни дадете некоја идеја за тоа како изгледа глобалната слика?<br/><br/>Ханс Цолнер СЈ<br/><br/>ХЗ: Моето разбирање, откако посетив околу 50 земји на пет или шест континенти, е дека Црквата навистина почнува да се движи во текот на последните неколку години на прашањето на правдата кон жртвите, да ги слуша и да прави сè што може да се направи во однос на заштитата.<br/><br/>Бев со иезуитските провинцијали од цела Африка кон крајот на април, а претседателот на иезуитската асистенција на Африка и Мадагаскар е многу посветен и посветен на ова. Тој подготвува темелен акционен план за формирање и воведување насоки насекаде. Тоа е многу внимателен и намерен напор да се направи се што може да се направи за да се биде проактивно ангажиран како језуити во Африка - на континент каде до пред неколку години сето ова беше странски јазик.<br/><br/>Еден од предизвиците во обидот да се развие овој глобален пристап е дека се справувате со толку многу култури и толку многу различни разбирања. Како да го комбинирате ова и да се обидете да обезбедите обука и поддршка на верските заедници за решавање на овие прашања?<br/><br/>Ова е едно од главните прашања што ги имаме. Мислам дека можам да ја стимулирам дискусијата, да ја стимулирам рефлексијата и да ги подготвам луѓето колку што е можно повеќе за да можат да ја направат основата.<br/><br/>Центарот за заштита на децата на Грегоријанскиот универзитет не се преправа дека има одговор на секое прашање. Не само затоа што не ги знаеме специфичните контексти — можеби знаеме неколку од нив, туку зборуваме за илјадници култури, зборуваме за стотици јазици, зборуваме за многу различни правни позадини. Тоа варира дури и понекогаш во рамките на една земја, како што е Австралија, каде што имате држави во рамките на Комонвелтот на Австралија кои имаат различни закони од другите држави.<br/><br/>Јас сум некој кој се обидува да предизвика и поттикне дискусија и рефлексија. Јас сум исто така многу среќен да слушам луѓе.<br/><br/>Очигледно ја имавме Кралската комисија овде во Австралија, но кои се некои од другите начини на кои сте виделе дека гласовите на жртвите се поддржани низ целиот свет?<br/><br/>Во Франција постои една епархија која го воспостави она што тие го нарекуваат "простор за слушање". Таму, жртвите можат да излезат и тие можат да се изразат. Бискупот е присутен. Тоа е отворен простор во кој луѓето кои се неверојатно повредени се слободни барем да го изразат она што сакаат да го побараат од раководството на Црквата итн.<br/><br/>Има и други места во САД или во други земји каде што жртвите биле поканети од епархии, од провинции, од раководството на Црквата, да излезат. Морам да кажам дека во целина мислам дека има добра волја и има повеќе луѓе како епископите и провинцијалците кои ги слушаат жртвите отколку што знаеме. Но, не постои модел на давање на жртвите не само простор за изразување и слушање, туку и за активно вклучување во развојот на Црквата.<br/><br/>Во однос на создавањето простори за поддршка на жртвите, кои се некои од работите што сте ги виделе кои навистина би можеле да помогнат - и за кои би можеле да размислуваме овде во Австралија?<br/><br/>Една од главните точки што многу жртви ги поставуваат е: „Зарем не можеме да имаме, во рамките на парохијата, во рамките на училишните поставувања, редовен разговор кој вклучува преживеани од злоупотреба како редовни членови на комитет, комисија, звучна табла, група за повратни информации или нешто слично?“ Така што овој глас не е донесен само во одредена прилика, или каде што лицето се чувствува како тој или таа да е во точка за да може да зборува за тоа, туку [се слуша] на редовна основа - вградете го тој глас во системот.<br/><br/>Тоа ќе им помогне на преживеаните и жртвите, бидејќи тие ќе се чувствуваат добредојдени и ценети во специфичното искуство и во специфичните животни предизвици низ кои поминале. Второ, тоа ќе му помогне на заедницата во целина, бидејќи барем можеме да станеме се повеќе и повеќе чувствителни на она што се грижите и специфичните потреби на преживеаните - кои исто така можат да зборуваат за потребите на младите луѓе.<br/><br/>М: Имаме силни групи на преживеани тука во Австралија кои беа во можност да се поддржат едни со други преку тој процес. Но, сакате да кажете дека ни треба некаков начин да ги поддржиме тие групи, и да ги поддржиме тие луѓе, преку нашите сопствени институции, исто така?<br/><br/>И мислам дека треба да бидеме креативни. Ќе работи за едно училиште и една парохија и една епархија на еден начин, а за другите на друг начин. Бидејќи преживеаните со кои сум во постојан контакт, имаат многу слични барања и слични искуства во однос на тоа дали се добредојдени во Црквата или не – чувство на отфрлени или отфрлени. Но, тие, исто така, имаат сосема различни очекувања меѓу себе. Така што научив дека исто така треба да бидете многу блиски во прифаќањето на разликите во она што оваа специфична група, или овој специфичен преживеан, сака, барања и потреби.<br/><br/>М: Преживеаните зборуваат за тоа дека сакаат нивните приказни да бидат слушнати и признаени. Тука во Австралија ја имавме Кралската комисија, која обезбеди независен процес каде што жртвите можеа да се појават. Дали има потреба од такво нешто во однос на вистината, правдата и процесот на помирување за Црквата на меѓународно ниво?<br/><br/>Х: Да, мислам дека постои потреба за тоа на меѓународно ниво. Но мислам дека прво секоја локална црква треба да си ја направи својата домашна задача. Не гледам дека ќе се случи наскоро да се формира некој таков собор или комисија за да се испита оваа област за целата Црква. Црквата има 1,3 милијарди членови и е присутна во 190 земји, со секакви разлики во очекувањата во однос на психолошката, духовната и финансиската поддршка.<br/><br/>Постои една работа со која постојано комуницирам, работам со жртвите и ги слушам, а тоа е дека тие сакаат да бидат сослушани. Ако имаше чувство дека жртвите постојано се слушаат – во Рим и на други места – мислам дека тоа ќе им даде големо олеснување на многу жртви.<br/><br/>Мислам дека загриженоста на папата Фрањо, особено во врска со вашето прашање, е дека локалните цркви прават сè што можат за жртвите да бидат сослушани во таа конкретна земја. Имам листа на луѓе кои сакаат да разговараат директно со Светиот Отец, а тоа физички е невозможно. Бев таму во 2014 за да преведувам за двајца германски преживеани кои беа избрани со двајца ирски и двајца англиски преживеани кога ги примил шесте од нив дома. Тој го помина целото утро слушајќи ги еден по друг. За секој од нив, тој бил таму 40 до 45 минути. Ако го правел ова за секој преживеан, не можел повеќе да спие.<br/><br/>Неговиот пример е модел за целата Католичка црква на начинот на кој жртвите и преживеаните се примаат, добредојдени и слушани. Мислам дека ако епископите и провинцијалците во овој свет, во сите земји, го следат неговиот пример, многу преживеани навистина ќе го ценат тоа.<br/><br/>Архиепископот Диармуд Мартин неодамна беше цитиран непосредно пред Светскиот состанок на семејствата, за Папската комисија, велејќи дека таа е премала бидејќи моментално е поставена за да го постигне она што треба да го постигне. Какво е вашето мислење за тоа? Дали Црквата треба да вложи повеќе ресурси во тоа како ги надгледува овие прашања?<br/><br/>Во моментов сме 16 членови од сите континенти, како и од најголемите јазични групи. Ние претставуваме различни дисциплини и професии, а целта на комисијата – како и статутите кои штотуку беа објавени во државата – е да му даде совет на Светиот Отец.<br/><br/>Вообичаено недоразбирање во врска со комисијата е дека прво се занимаваме со случаи на наводи. Тоа не е случај. Ние немаме правна или административна моќ во однос на случаите, бидејќи кога станува збор за наводи за злоупотреба, судовите и постапките се поставени.<br/><br/>Второ недоразбирање е дека ние промовираме, директно, работите на терен. Нашата прва и главна цел е да го советуваме Светиот Отец за прашањата.<br/><br/>Затоа, од наша гледна точка, да, треба да инвестираме повеќе. Но, треба да инвестираме повеќе на локално ниво и треба да се погрижиме предлозите на Папската комисија да бидат испратени до Светиот Отец, што обично го прави Претседателот, а потоа постои процес на следење кој го одразува она што го дадовме како наш совет.<br/><br/>Во Австралија, Catholic Professional Standards Limited го надгледува одговорот на Црквата и обезбедува насоки и поддршка за обезбедување на сите институции во Црквата да бидат институции безбедни за децата. Дали е потребна некаква организациска поддршка од Рим за оние епископи и епархии кои се борат да ги формираат овие институции и да обезбедат заштита во тие епархии?<br/><br/>Мислам дека на крајот комисијата ќе се развие во таа насока. Тие сега се во процес на ангажирање експерти во тие области.<br/><br/>Мислам дека Црквата треба да разбере дека локалните цркви можат да учат едни од други. И моето разбирање отсекогаш било - и мислам дека Светиот Отец нè потсети - дека Црквата нема да функционира како централизирана компанија. Тоа не функционира така, ефикасно. Секој епископ, секоја епископска конференција, има, до одреден степен, свој живот. Она што треба да научиме повеќе е да отвориме канали за меѓусебна комуникација.<br/><br/>Постојат голем број на работи кои луѓето ги обвинуваат за злоупотреба во Црквата. Како свештеник и психолог, и како некој кој се сретнал и работел со преживеани, што мислите за тоа прашање?<br/><br/>Мислам дека прашањето од каде доаѓа злоупотребата е најважно, и Папата се обрати на тоа во своето писмо до Божјиот народ објавено на 20 август. Тој вели во првиот параграф, и го повторува тоа одново и одново, дека прашањето на сексуалната злоупотреба е секогаш поврзано – или речиси секогаш поврзано – не само со прашањето на злоупотреба на власта, туку и со злоупотреба на совеста.<br/><br/>Значи, вистинското фундаментално прашање на злоупотребата е многу покомплексно од самото прашање на сексуалноста – без разлика дали е хетеросексуална или хомосексуална. Тоа е прашање на моќ, и таму навистина мораме да работиме на прашањето како го разбираме свештеништвото, како го разбираме епископството, како ги разбираме и живееме нашите министерства? Кои се границите?<br/><br/>Затоа сум многу среќен што Језуитската Покраина во Австралија воспоставува кодекс на однесување. Бидејќи не зборуваме само за сексуална злоупотреба на малолетници. Зборуваме за сексуална злоупотреба на возрасни, и зборуваме за злоупотреба на други начини - како злоупотреба на совеста, каде што му диктирате на некого што мислите, или се преправате дека знаете од Бог, и можете да кажете на друго лице, "Треба да го направите тоа", против совеста на таа личност.<br/><br/>Многумина мислат дека целибатот предизвикува злоупотреба. Како што секогаш велам, целибатот како таков не е причина за злоупотреба - во спротивно, како да објасниме дека 99,9% од сите злоставувачи не живеат во целибат, и како да објасниме дека 95% или 96% од сите свештеници не злоупотребуваат малолетници? Но, целибатот, или заветот на чесност, кој не е навистина интегриран, кој не се живее соодветно — да, тоа создава проблем. Понекогаш луѓето почнуваат да пијат, понекогаш се коцкаат, а понекогаш и сексуално малтретирање, со возрасни и со малолетници.<br/><br/>Вистинското прашање во врска со ова е како да се справиме со поимот на религиозната духовна моќ со која се вложуваат свештениците и епископите? Како може теологијата да ни помогне да разбереме, и можеби како може социологијата, психологијата или бизнис администрацијата да ни помогнат да ги дефинираме границите на моќта и потребата да ги задржиме вашите граници? |
| I'm not surprised by this mismatch. In fact, I'd even go so far as to say this isn't something that will ever change, nor should we get all steamed up about changing it. In 10 years, we'll still have bleeding edge, complex items in the biggest concerns list, and the things we're finally getting around to understanding will be the major parts of our spending.<br/><br/>Now, Gunnar and Andy both have excellent points, specifically about IT teams seeing IT problems and solving them with IT solutions; in fact, I'm positive their points hold merit.<br/><br/>But I think there are other ideas that trump those (I did comment on their blogs about it, and later decided I should just blog here). Those top 3 concerns are bleedingly new such that:<br/><br/>we fear new things because we don't understand them, or don't understand them because they're new.<br/><br/>they're too new for us to have solid approaches to handling them.<br/><br/>they're too new for us to know if we should be worried or not! we tend to default to paranoid/worried, which is good!<br/><br/>too new to have obvious budget items assigned to them. Can I buy a box or some software that provide "cloud security" or "social media security?"<br/><br/>they're so new the business doesn't even know how to use them or what they want out of them. Let alone how we can secure them while still meeting or at least not stomping all over business needs. If the business doesn't even know how to use them yet, I'm not sure security is in any position to guide that usage securely.<br/><br/>It also should be mentioned that these new things are being largely pushed via consumerland and into the business, with IT as a sort of, "Oh yeah," thought. Firewalls, AV, AM, Auth are all IT responses to typically IT issues. Of course there is a difference there. They're also very subjective issues, as opposed to very objective items like firewalls, known malicious bits, behaviors, signatures, ports. Business presents very complex issues that are often involving people (which we can't patch) and that often don't fit nicely into blanket rules. Even if we turned away from technical solutions and devoted our time into solving these problems, they are still not going to be neatly solved. Likewise, when push comes to shove, can you have and meet goals with firewalls? Can you show improvement? All of this flows from the rather subjective non-technical aspect of those issues. Sort of the difference between a child's report card and the feedback you get from a parent-teacher conference. If you have a child, which one would you be most inclined to disagree with or not necessarily believe? (The answer is the subjective one!)<br/><br/>It could be said this is the natural progression of security and technology: from shoring up the technical controls to moving up the stack towards behavior and people. Sure, these 3 top concerns can be said to punch through firewalls and network segments, but that's the nature of those things (social media "punching" through a firewall is far different than me punching through an SSH connection to bridge my home network; social media is akin to the *way* I use my SSH connection after the hold is already punched because it is needed; i.e. social media is the way port 80 is used.)<br/><br/>Basically, all indications point to not being surprised by this dichotomy. And I don't think this is some further indication that IT/security is doing it wrong, or isn't aligned properly with business, or has a technical dark-server-room background. I'm not saying we're doing things right or we're properly aligned, but the above isn't a good argument to support the theory of those deficiencies.<br/><br/>Now for a really big jump. I'd liken the current increase in mobile computing to be as big as the introduction of computers into the business and later the PC/internet into business. Now, I wasn't around when the former happened, nor was I in the industry when the personal computer revolution swept into business, but I would bet that is the closest comparison so far. I may even say the same for social media. These are damned new and they're big changes beyond just bringing in Macs or new software or some new business process. | Всушност, дури и би отишол толку далеку што би рекол дека ова не е нешто што некогаш ќе се промени, ниту дека треба да се возбудиме за промена. За 10 години, сеуште ќе имаме крвави рабови, сложени предмети на листата на најголеми проблеми, а работите што конечно ќе ги разбереме ќе бидат главните делови од нашите трошоци.<br/><br/>Сега, Гунар и Енди имаат одлични поени, особено за ИТ тимовите кои гледаат ИТ проблеми и ги решаваат со ИТ решенија; всушност, јас сум сигурен дека нивните поени имаат заслуга.<br/><br/>Но, мислам дека постојат и други идеи кои ги поттикнуваат оние (јас коментирав на нивните блогови за тоа, а подоцна одлучив дека треба само да блогам тука). Овие врвни 3 загрижености се крваво нови, така што:<br/><br/>Се плашиме од нови работи затоа што не ги разбираме, или не ги разбираме затоа што се нови.<br/><br/>Премногу се нови за да имаме цврсти пристапи кон нив.<br/><br/>Премногу се нови за да знаеме дали треба да бидеме загрижени или не! имаме тенденција да бидеме параноични / загрижени, што е добро!<br/><br/>премногу нов за да имаат очигледни буџетски предмети доделени на нив. Може ли да купам кутија или некој софтвер кој обезбедува "облак безбедност" или "социјални медиуми безбедност?"<br/><br/>тие се толку нови што бизнисот дури и не знае како да ги користи или што сакаат од нив. Да не зборуваме за тоа како можеме да ги обезбедиме додека сеуште ги исполнуваме или барем не ги газиме сите деловни потреби. Ако бизнисот сеуште не знае како да ги користи, не сум сигурен дека безбедноста е во состојба безбедно да ја води таа употреба.<br/><br/>Исто така, треба да се спомене дека овие нови работи во голема мера се туркаат преку потрошувачката земја и во бизнисот, со ИТ како еден вид, "О да," мисла. Огнените ѕидови, AV, AM, Auth се сите ИТ одговори на типични ИТ прашања. Секако дека има разлика таму. Тие се исто така многу субјективни прашања, за разлика од многу објективни предмети како заштитен ѕид, познати малициозни битови, однесување, потписи, портови. Бизнисот претставува многу сложени прашања кои често вклучуваат луѓе (кои не можеме да ги закрпиме) и кои често не се вклопуваат добро во општите правила. Дури и ако се свртевме од техничките решенија и го посветивме нашето време за решавање на овие проблеми, тие се уште нема да бидат уредно решени. Исто така, кога доаѓа до притисок да се турка, можете да имате и да ги исполните целите со firewalls? Можете ли да покажете подобрување? Сето ова произлегува од прилично субјективниот нетехнички аспект на тие прашања. Сорта на разликата помеѓу картичката на извештајот на детето и повратните информации што ги добивате од родител-наставник конференција. Ако имате дете, кое од нив би било најсклоно да се согласувате или да не верувате? (Одговорот е субјективен!)<br/><br/>Може да се каже дека ова е природен напредок на безбедноста и технологијата: од засилување на техничките контроли до движење нагоре кон однесувањето и луѓето. Секако, за овие 3 главни проблеми може да се каже дека удираат низ заштитните ѕидови и мрежните сегменти, но тоа е природата на тие работи (социјалните медиуми "удираат" преку заштитен ѕид е далеку различно од моето удирање преку SSH конекција за да ја премости мојата домашна мрежа; социјалните медиуми се слични на * начин * Јас ја користам мојата SSH врска откако е веќе удната бидејќи е потребна; т.<br/><br/>Во суштина, сите индикации укажуваат на тоа дека не сме изненадени од оваа дихотомија. И не мислам дека ова е некоја понатамошна индикација дека ИТ / безбедноста го прави тоа погрешно, или не е правилно усогласена со бизнисот, или има техничка темна серверска соба. Не велам дека работите ги правиме правилно или дека сме правилно усогласени, но горенаведеното не е добар аргумент за поддршка на теоријата за тие недостатоци.<br/><br/>Сега за навистина голем скок. Би сакал сегашното зголемување на мобилните компјутери да биде исто толку големо како и воведувањето на компјутери во бизнисот, а подоцна и на компјутерот / интернетот во бизнисот. Сега, не бев во близина кога се случи првото, ниту бев во индустријата кога револуцијата на персоналните компјутери влегоа во бизнисот, но се обложувам дека тоа е најблиската споредба досега. Можам дури и да го кажам истото за социјалните медиуми. Овие се проклето нови и тие се големи промени надвор од само донесување на Macs или нов софтвер или некој нов бизнис процес. |
