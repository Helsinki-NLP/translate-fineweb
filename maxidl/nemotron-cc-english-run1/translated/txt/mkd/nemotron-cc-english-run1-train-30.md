Undocumented migrants have nothing. They are not allowed to work. They have no right to state benefits nor to a place to live. They are unseen and potentially the most vulnerable group in the UK today.<br/><br/>Undocumented (or irregular) migrants include those trafficked into the sex trade or for domestic servitude; they include visa overstayers; those whose asylum applications have been refused and others who have been subject to failures in the immigration system. All of these may originally have come to the UK legally.<br/><br/>'Illegal immigrants' – those imagined to have entered the country in the backs of lorries – make up a small proportion of the undocumented.<br/><br/>Indeed some sources suggest that half the estimated 120,000 undocumented children in the UK were actually born here to undocumented parents. These children are disadvantaged from birth, solely by their immigration status.<br/><br/>The blog tells the stories of the undocumented. It highlights their daily struggles and vulnerabilities, but also their strength and resilience. It's not an easy read.<br/><br/>You can access the blog via our website (bottom of right hand column on Home Page).<br/><br/>The blog has won the online category of the Speaking Together media awards. The awards were a new addition this year to the Migrant and Refugee Woman of the Year Awards celebration at the Royal Festival Hall in London as part of International Women's Day. The panel of judges – including novelist and playwright Gillian Slovo, and journalist and author, Hannah Pool – was particularly looking for work that challenged myths and stereotypes.<br/><br/>The blog has also won the Blog North Awards 2013 in the Best Writing category and was also shortlisted for an Amnesty International Media Award. | Пост навигација<br/><br/>„Живот без документи“ ја доби наградата за најдобро пишување<br/><br/>Блог проектот „Живот без документи“, создаден од Лен Грант, содржи приказни за семејствата на мигранти без документи и млади луѓе. Мигрантите без документи немаат ништо. Не им е дозволено да работат. Тие немаат право на државни бенефиции ниту на место за живеење. Тие се невидена и потенцијално најранливата група во Велика Британија денес.<br/><br/>Недокументираните (или нерегуларните) мигранти ги вклучуваат оние кои биле тргувани во сексуална трговија или за домашно ропство; тие вклучуваат престој на виза; оние чии барања за азил биле одбиени и други кои биле предмет на неуспеси во имиграцискиот систем. Сите тие првично може да дојдат во Обединетото Кралство легално.<br/><br/>„Нелегалните имигранти“ – оние за кои се претпоставува дека влегле во земјата со камиони – сочинуваат мал дел од нелегалните.<br/><br/>Навистина, некои извори укажуваат дека половина од проценетите 120.000 деца без документи во Обединетото Кралство всушност биле родени тука од родители без документи. Овие деца се во неповолна положба од раѓање, само со нивниот имиграционен статус.<br/><br/>Блогот ги раскажува приказните за недокументираните. Ги нагласува нивните секојдневни борби и ранливости, но и нивната сила и отпорност. Тоа не е лесно читање.<br/><br/>Можете да пристапите до блогот преку нашата веб-страница (долу на десната колона на почетната страница).<br/><br/>Блогот ја освои онлајн категоријата на медиумските награди Speaking Together. Наградите беа нов додаток оваа година на прославата за доделување на наградите за мигранти и бегалци на годината во Кралската фестивалска сала во Лондон како дел од Меѓународниот ден на жената. Судската комисија, вклучувајќи ја и писателката Џилијан Слово и новинарката и авторката Хана Пул, особено бараше работа која ги предизвикува митовите и стереотипите.<br/><br/>Блогот, исто така, ги освои Blog North Awards 2013 во категоријата за најдобро пишување, а исто така беше и во краткиот список за награди за медиуми на Меѓународната Амнести. |
| Sabbath School Lesson<br/><br/>In Galatians, Paul tackles issues such as freedom, the role of the law in salvation, our condition in Christ, and the nature of the Spirit-led life, as well as the age-old question, How can sinful humans be made right before a holy and just God?<br/><br/>Many scholars believe that Galatians may be the earliest of Paul's letters. It was written in A.D. 49, shortly after the famous Jerusalem Council (Acts 15). Therefore, the book may be the oldest Christian document known. As Acts and Galatians make clear, the early church found itself in a fierce battle over the nature of salvation, especially in the case of Gentiles. According to a group of Jewish believers, known as Judaizers, belief in Jesus alone was not good enough for Gentiles. Gentiles must also be circumcised and follow the laws of Moses (Acts 15:1).<br/><br/>This quarter's Bible study guide invites us to journey with the apostle Paul as he pleads with the Galatians to remain true to Jesus. It also gives us a chance to reflect on our own understanding of the truths that opened the way for Martin Luther's ultimate break with Rome and the restoration of the biblical gospel. | Сабота училиште лекција<br/><br/>Во Галатите, Павле се занимава со прашања како што се слободата, улогата на законот во спасението, нашата состојба во Христос и природата на животот предводен од Духот, како и вековното прашање: Како може грешните луѓе да бидат направени пред свет и праведен Бог?<br/><br/>Многу научници веруваат дека Галатјаните може да биде најраниот од Писмата на Павле. Тоа е напишано во 49 година н.е., кратко по познатиот Ерусалимски собор (Дела 15). Затоа, книгата може да биде најстариот христијански документ познат. Како што јасно се наведува во Дела и Галатјаните, раната црква се најде во жестока битка за природата на спасението, особено во случајот на незнабошците. Според една група еврејски верници, познати како јудаисти, верата во Исус не била доволна само за не-Евреите. Не-Евреите, исто така, мора да бидат обрежани и да ги следат законите на Мојсеј (Дела 15:1).<br/><br/>Водичот за проучување на Библијата во оваа четвртина нѐ повикува да патуваме со апостол Павле додека тој ги моли Галатите да останат верни на Исус. Исто така, ни дава можност да размислуваме за сопственото разбирање на вистините кои го отворија патот за крајниот раскин на Мартин Лутер со Рим и враќањето на библиското евангелие. |

Првично владеел како војвода, тој бил издигнат до чин на војвода во 1815 година. Пред да го наследи тронот, тој служел како гувернер на Хановер од 1776 до 1786 година, на 11 декември 1752 година неговиот вујко Адолф Фридрих III починал и како резултат на тоа постариот брат на Чарлс го наследил како Адолф Фридрих IV. Со вознесувањето на неговите браќа Чарлс бил однесен со остатокот од семејството од Миров во главниот град Стрелиц, од четиригодишна возраст, Чарлс изгледал подготвен за кариера во хановерската служба откако му била дадена капетанска комисија. Неговата сестра Шарлот се омажила за изборниот кнез на Хановер, кралот Џорџ III од Обединетото Кралство на 8 септември 1761 година, во есента на 1776 година, Чарлс бил назначен за генерален гувернер на Хановер од неговиот зет. Како гувернер на Хановер, Чарлс всушност ги имал сите овластувања на суверен владетел и неговиот зет немал желба да живее во Германија, бидејќи бил целосно англиски. Набрзо откако бил вдовец во декември 1785 година, Чарлс побарал дозвола да се повлече од своите воени вработувања во Хановер. Неговиот зет го исполнил неговото барање, го унапредил Чарлс во чин фелдмаршал, Чарлс потоа поминал некое време патувајќи пред да се насели во Дармштат, каде што станал претседател на Империјалната кредитна комисија. По смртта на неговиот постар брат Адолф Фридрих IV на 2 јуни 1794 година, како владетел, Чарлс поттикнал нови земјоделски трендови, воспоставил нова полициска сила и спровел задолжително образование.

Двете ќерки станале германски кралици, Шарлот починала на 12 декември 1785 година, кратко по раѓањето на нивниот син, војводата Чарлс од Мекленбург.<br/><br/>1314.<br/>Фридрих, војвода од Саксонија-Алтенбург<br/>-<br/>Фридрих, војвода од Саксонија-Хилдбургхаузен, бил војвода од Саксонија-Хилдбургхаузен и војвода од Саксонија-Алтенбург. Тој бил најмладото дете, но единствениот син, на Ернст Фридрих III, војвода од Саксонија-Хилдбургхаузен, од неговата трета сопруга, Ернестина од Сакс. Во 1806 година, Фридрих се приклучил на Рајнската Конфедерација, а во 1815 година на Германската Конфедерација, во Хилдбургхаузен на 3 септември 1785 година, Фридрих се оженил со војвотката Шарлот Џорџина од Мекленбург-Стрелиц. Имале дванаесет деца, Јозеф Георг Карл Фредерик, катарина Шарлот Џорџина Фредерика Софија Тереза, омажена на 28 септември 1805 година за принцот Павле од Виртемберг.

Франц Фредерик Карл Лудвиг Георг Хајнрих, Фредерик Вилхелм Карл Јозеф Лудвиг Георг. Фредерик се сметаше за популарен и интелигентен, за време на неговото владеење, заедно со неговата прекрасна сопруга, Шарлот, културниот живот во малиот град го достигна својот зенит. Толку многу поети и уметници го поминале своето време таму што Хилдбургхаузен бил наречен Клајн-Вајмар, кога последниот војвода од Саксо-Гота-Алтенбург починал без проблем во 1825 година, другите гранки на куќата одлучиле за преуредување на Ернестинските војводства. На 12 ноември 1826 година, Фридрих станал војвода од Саксо-Алтенбург, на кој тој му го дал првиот Основен закон во 1831 година, во замена за медиумите поврзани со Фридрих, војводата од Саксо-Алтенбург на Викимедија.<br/><br/>Фридрих, војвода од Саксонија-Алтенбург<br/>-<br/>Фредерик<br/><br/>Петнаесет.<br/>војвотката Шарлот Георгина од Мекленбург-Стрелиц<br/>-<br/>Шарлот Џорџин е родена во Хановер, изборното кнежество на Брауншвајг-Линебург. Таа била најстарото дете и ќерка на Чарлс II, големиот војвода од Мекленбург, Шарлот и нејзините сестри, кралицата Луиза од Прусија, кралицата Фредерика од Хановер и принцезата Тереза од Турн унд Таксис, се сметале за најубавите жени на своето време. Жан Пол Фридрих Рихтер го посветил својот роман Титан на четворицата убавици, Шарлот израснала во Хановер, каде што нејзиниот татко служел како гувернер, во име на неговиот зет, кралот Џорџ III од Обединетото Кралство, кој живеел во Лондон. Кога Шарлот имала дванаесет години, нејзината мајка починала и таа била воспитана од сестрата на нејзината мајка, Шарлот, која се омажила за нејзиниот татко во 1784 година, а нејзините сестри биле донесени од нејзината баба, Марија Луиз Албертина од Лајнинген-Фалкенбург-Дагсбург во Дармштат. На 3 септември 1785 година, на возраст од петнаесет години, Шарлот се омажила за војводата Фридрих, војводата од Саксо-Алтенбург, бракот не бил среќен, Шарлот била ментално супериорна во однос на Фридрих, кој почнал да ја игнорира. Тие исто така имале проблеми, Саксо-Хилдбургхаузен бил финансиски уништен од катастрофалната политика на претходниците на Фредерикс. Примачите дозволиле на војводата и војвотката само намалена цивилна листа, таткото на Шарлот и двајца браќа често престојувале со Шарлот во Хилдбургхаузен. Во 1787 година, таа се преселила во Хилдбургхаузен засекогаш и станала претседател на кредитниот комитет. Во 1792 година, бабата на Шарлот и нејзините сестри побегнале пред напредната француска војска од Дармштат во Хилдбургхаузен и нејзината баба забележала за сопругот на Шарлот. Од сите свои должности, тој ги исполнува своите брачни должности со ревност. Шарлот, која никогаш не го сакала овој човек, е секогаш бремена, семејството поминало неколку недели безгрижно во Хилдбургхаузен. Во 1793 година, бабата на Шарлот се вратила од егзил и патувала со сестрите на Шарлот во Франкфурт на Мајна, Шарлот имала многу интимна и љубовна врска со нејзината сестра Фридерика и роднините во Стрелиц. Во 1803 и 1805 година, пруската кралска двојка го посетила Хилдбургхаузен, за оваа пригода, приемниците им дозволиле на војводската двојка да обнови дел од нивниот мебел. Луиза помогнала во изготвувањето на објавувањето на војната, христијанинот Трухсес фон Вецхаузен зу Бетенбург бил пријател на војводскиот пар и кум на синот на Шарлот, Едвард. Многу гледачи дошле да ја видат баварската престолонаследничка принцеза, кога ги примила своите гости, Трухсес се обидел да ја доведе пониската Шарлот во неговиот замок, но таа одбила, мислејќи на нејзината ќерка. Truchseß одговори, Ваше Височество ќе ми прости, но додека овој замок стои тука, Тереза потоа зграби бароните друга рака, и тројцата од нив одеше низ портата заедно. Војвотката даде околу половина од нејзиниот приход на сиромашните, пензионери<br/><br/>1617.<br/>Принцот Чарлс од Хесен-Касел<br/>-<br/>Принцот Чарлс од Хесен-Касел бил кадетски член на династијата Хесен-Касел и дански генерал-фелдмаршал. Пораснал со роднини на данскиот двор, тој го поминал поголемиот дел од својот живот во Данска и неговата мајка била ќерка на кралот Џорџ II од Велика Британија и Каролина од Ансбах и сестра на кралицата Луиза од Данска. Неговиот татко, идниот ландгроф, го напуштил семејството во 1747 година, а во 1755 година официјално го прекинал бракот со Марија. Дедото, Вилијам VIII, ландгрофот на Хесен, му го доделил округот Ханау и неговите приходи на Марија, младиот принц Чарлс и неговите двајца браќа, Вилијам и Фредерик, кои биле одгледани од нивната мајка и негувани од протестантски роднини од 1747 година. Во 1756 година, Марија се преселила во Данска, за да се грижи за малолетните деца на нејзината сестра, кралицата Луиза од Данска. Со неа, ги зела своите синови кои биле израснати на дворот во палатата Кристијанборг во Копенхаген. Хесенските кнезови подоцна останале во Данска, станувајќи нејзини важни лордови, само најстариот брат Вилијам се вратил во Хесен, во 1785 година, по издигањето на ландгрофството. Чарлс започнал кариера во Данска. Во 1758 година бил назначен за полковник, на возраст од 20 години генерал-мајор, исто така во 1766 година, тој бил назначен за генерал-гувернер на Норвешка, позиција што ја држел до 1768 година, но која останала главно титуларна, бидејќи тој никогаш не отишол во Норвешка во овој период. Во 1763 година, неговиот постар брат Вилијам се оженил со нивниот прв братучед, Чарлс го следел примерот на 30 август 1766 година во палатата Кристијанборг - неговата сопруга била Луиза од Данска, а Чарлс на тој начин станал зет на неговиот братучед, кралот Кристијан VII. Бракот се одржал и покрај советите дадени против него, поради обвинувањата за расипаност од страна на принцот Чарлс. Набрзо потоа, Чарлс паднал во непријатност на дворот, а на почетокот на 1767 година тој и тие го имале првото дете, Мари Софи, таму во 1767 година, а потоа и нивното второ дете, Вилијам, во 1769 година. Во 1768 година, Чарлс го купил имотот и селото Офенбах-Румпенхајм од семејството Еделсхајм. Во 1771 година тој го проширил дворецот во замок и кнежевско седиште, а неговата мајка Марија живеела во палатата до нејзината смрт во 1772 година. Во 1781 година, Чарлс ја продал палатата Румпенхајм на својот помлад брат, Чарлс се населил во замокот Готорп во Шлезвиг со неговото семејство. Тие го имале своето трето дете Фридрих таму во 1771 година, во 1770 година, кралот Кристијан VII му го дал на својата сестра имотот Тегелхоф во Гиби помеѓу градот Шлезвиг и Екернферде. Од 1772 до 1776 година, Чарлс имал летна резиденција изградена на местото што тој го нарекол Луизенлунд во чест на неговата сопруга, во септември 1772 година, Чарлс бил назначен за врховен командант на норвешката војска и тој и Луиза се преселиле во Кристијана. Доделувањето било последица на државниот удар на шведскиот крал Густав III на 19 август 1772 година, додека во Норвешка принцезата Лујза го родила четвртото дете Јулијана во 1773 година.<br/><br/>Осумнаесет.<br/>Луиз Каролина од Хесен-Касел<br/>-<br/>Луиз Каролина е родена во Готорп во Војводството Шлезвиг на ландгрофот Чарлс од Хесен-Касел и неговата сопруга принцезата Луиз од Данска.

Тој се смета за основач на Каса дЕсте, бидејќи бил глава на првото семејство да биде господар на Есте, Алберто Азо II бил единствениот син на Алберто Азо I, маркизот на Милано. Тој ги наследил своите татковски канцеларии околу 1020 година и постојано го зголемувал својот имот во северна Италија, во 1069-1070 година, тој се обидел да го стекне Мејн за неговиот син Хју, бидејќи неговата сопруга, Гарсенде, била ко-наследничка на претходните грофови на Мејн. Хју бил прогласен за гроф, но не можел да го победи Роберт, војводата од Нормандија, во спорот за инвеститура помеѓу Хенри IV, Светиот римски император и папата Григориј VII, Азо се обидел да посредува, но подоцна се приклучил на страната на папата. Околу 1073 година тој направил замок во Есте неговата резиденција, од која куќата на Есте, пред неговиот градежен проект, Есте била малку повеќе од село. Неговиот син Велф се преселил прво во Корушка, а потоа во Баварија, создавајќи едно од најважните семејства во европската историја, друг син, Фулк I од Милано, ја направил првата документирана употреба на титулата Маркиз дЕсте. Азо II се оженил со Кунигунда, ќерка на Велф II, гроф од Алтдорф и имале едно познато дете, Велф војводата од Баварија од 1070 до 1077 и од 1096 до неговата смрт кој бил првиот член на Велф филијалата на династијата Есте.

Некои извори велат дека тој исто така се оженил со Виталија Орсеоло, ќерка на Петар Орсеоло и имал вонбрачна афера со Матилда, сестра на Вилијам, бискуп на Падова, со која имал ќерка по име Аделазија која се омажила за Гуљелмо Аделарди.

Тој бил првиот член на Велф филијалата на Домот на Есте, во генеалогијата на Постариот дом на Велф тој се смета како Велф IV. Велф бил син на Азо II од Есте и неговата сопруга Кунигунда од Алтдорф, кога чичкото на Велф, војводата од Корушка, починал без деца, а Велф го наследил својот имот. Велф се оженил со Етелинда од Нортхајм, ќерка на Ото II, војводата од Баварија, кога неговиот свекор, војводата Ото, станал непријател на кралот Хенри IV и го изгубил неговото војводство, Велф останал лојален на кралот. Во согласност со наредбите на Хенри, тој ја отфрлил и се развел од својата војвотка Етелинда и овој настан се одржал во Гослар во 1070 година, кога покраините Баварија тивко му се покориле на новосоздадениот војвода, кој бил претставник на едно од најстарите семејства во покраината. Неговото отфрлање на војвотката, кое би можело да се смета за чин на неправда. Папата и императорот површно се помириле во 1076 година, но годината повторно ги виделе ангажирани во активни непријателства. Хенри, како последица на повторените акти на бунт, го прогласил Велф за соборен во своето ново стекнато војводство. Сепак, поддржан од неговите верни Баварци и со помош на неговиот татко во Италија, Велф успеал да го задржи своето место, сепак, Григориј починал во 1085 година и неговите наследници земале помалку интензивно учество во работите на Германија. Велф, иако сè уште се придржувал кон црковната партија, по разводот, во 1070 година, од неговата прва сопруга, Велф се оженил со Јудит од Фландрија, ќерка на Балдвин IV, грофот од Фландрија, и вдовицата на Тостиг Годвинсон, грофот од Нортумбрија. Во 1089 година, синот на Велф, Велф, се оженил со Матилда од Тоскана, со што ги зајакнал односите со папата, но откако помладата Велф се развела од Матилда во 1095 година, Велф се помирил со кралот Хенри IV и бил повторно потврден како војвода на Баварија. По смртта на неговиот татко Азо во 1097 година, Велф се обидел да го стекне имотот на неговите татковци јужно од Алпите, во 1099 година, Велф се приклучил на она што ќе стане познато како крстоносна војна од 1101 година, заедно со Вилијам IX од Аквитанија, Хуго од Вермандоа и Ида од Австрија. Неговиот главен успех бил да се спречи судирот меѓу сонародниците крстоносци, кои ја ограбувале византиската територија на пат кон Константинопол, самиот Велф избегал од фијаско, но починал на враќање во Пафос, Кипар, во 1101 година и бил погребан во опатијата Вајнгартен.

Како млад човек, тој управувал со семејниот имот Есте јужно од Алпите, преку неговиот брак со Вулфилда, ќерка на војводата Магнус од Саксонија, околу 1095 година, тој стекнал дел од имотот Билунг околу Линебург. Тој се обидел да го наследи неговиот свекор како саксонски војвода кога Магнус умрел без наследници во 1106 година. Војводата Хенри сепак ги одржувал блиските односи со владејачката салијанска династија, во 1116 година, тој се придружил на царот Хенри V со втора италијанска кампања за преземање на имотите на покојната маркиза Матилда од Тоскана. Тој го наследил својот постар брат Велф II како баварски војвода, кога починал без деца во 1120 година, Хенри исто така бил инструмент во донесувањето на Конкордатот од Вормс во 1122 година, ставајќи крај на долготрајната инвеститурна контроверзија помеѓу папата и императорот. Бракот бил склучен во мај 1127 година, отуѓувањето помеѓу династиите Велф и Хоенштауфен траело до 13 век. Откако Лотар победил на изборите, тој наметнал царска забрана на Фридрих II.

Ние даваме некои чоколади (орев бесплатно) и чипс (орех и глутен бесплатно), како и Ноќта на вештерките моливи и гуми. Го сакам Ноќта на вештерките!!! Сакам да ги видам сите костими! Во случај да се прашувате зошто можеме да им дадеме моливи, гумички и многу бонбони на нашите трикови или третмани, ова е причината зошто...<br/><br/>Ние добиваме само околу десетина или така деца во нашето соседство !! Тоа е далеку од 300 и нешто деца секогаш имавме во градот !!! Hubby не се грижи. На овој начин тој добива да ги имаат сите бонбони кои не беа дадени надвор!<br/><br/>6 јули<br/>Коментари:<br/><br/>Синоќа беше Ноќта на вештерките и немавме деца на нашата врата.<br/><br/>Ноќта на вештерките не се слави тука. Продавниците се обидуваат да го промовираат со рекламирање и продажба на разни опрема за Ноќта на вештерките, но тоа воопшто не се фати. Всушност, постои отпор кон тоа од страна на многумина.<br/><br/>Сега е 6:30 и сеуште немаме никакви трикови или третмани. Вечерва имам "бонбони". Мојот сопруг вечерва ќе го земе ТЦ околу соседството.<br/><br/>ние даваме мини чоколадни барови и costco бонбони микс (лижавчиња, слатки колачи, tootsie ролни и така натаму). имаме некои дади балон гума за непристојни деца кои не велат трик или лекување, ве молиме или ви благодарам (normallhy постарите тинејџери). јас сум толку злобен. Ако не се љубезни со мене, тогаш ќе добијат едно мало парче бонбони. Да се надеваме дека нема да ни јадат куќата подоцна таа ноќ. |
| Follow Us<br/><br/>ARE YOU AN<br/><br/>INSIDER<br/><br/>Craving Sugar? Here's What Your Body Is Trying to Tell You<br/><br/>by<br/>Byrdie<br/><br/>PHOTO:<br/><br/>Jacquemus<br/><br/>Weight gain from out-of-control cravings aside, it can be frustrating to have a constant hankering for something unhealthy and not know why. The good news is that there's usually a reason underlying that burning desire to house a bag of potato chips, or the feeling that you might actually die if you don't get a pickle rightthisinstant (even though you're not pregnant). If you're having visions of Milky Way bars, for example, it could mean that you're missing a very specific nutrient in your diet. (Yup—it's more complicated than said chocolate bar being so darn delicious.)<br/><br/>We talked to Los Angeles–based dietitian Shira Lenchewski, M.S., R.D., to get the skinny on some common food cravings, as well as what you can do to satiate the hunger without going overboard. Keep scrolling for some seriously good information!<br/><br/>If you're craving chocolate<br/><br/>It means: You could be lacking magnesium in your diet, says Lenchewski. "Magnesium is an essential mineral involved in energy production, glucose metabolism, and muscle function. This is especially true for those hitting the gym hard," she explains. Additionally, magnesium levels lower during the pre-menstrual weeks of your period, which explains why PMS so often comes with chocolate cravings.<br/><br/>Instead, reach for high-quality, low-sugar dark chocolate, which is naturally high in magnesium. "I recommend sticking to 75 per cent cocoa or higher, and pairing it with another magnesium-rich source like sunflower seeds," says Lenchewski. She suggests the chocolate brand Hu, a small-batch food company that focuses on high-quality ingredients produced locally. "It's a little pricey, but all the more reason to keep portions in check," she says. "It's my personal favourite." We're also big fans of superfood-packed Zenbunni.<br/><br/>If you're craving candy<br/><br/>It means: "Craving pure sugar is a good indication that you're running low on energy," says Lenchewski. "Think about it. What is the one thing you're itching for after a terrible night's sleep or at around 4 p.m. during a stressful workday? The answer is usually sugar because it's used as instant fuel for our body's cells."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for apples with nut butter. "If you're raiding your co-workers' candy stash, I recommend a more slow-burn carbohydrate with a source of fat or protein," says Lenchewski. "Unlike simple sugar, this will fuel your cells while avoiding the post-sugar crash. Two options that make for great pick-me-ups the next time you're craving candy: a sliced apple with your choice of nut butter, or berries with 2% unsweetened Greek yoghurt." We like quashing a sweet tooth with these addictive coconut chips, too—they're filling, free of any added sugar, and just so good.<br/><br/>If you're craving salt<br/><br/>It means: "If nothing but the saltiest pickle will do, you may not be drinking enough H2O," says Lenchewski. "Salt helps the body hold on to water, so we crave it when we're in need of fluids."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for water. "Stay hydrated, especially as we approach the summer months," she says. The next time a craving hits, try quenching it (literally) with a few refreshing glasses and you might find the urgency to sodium binge disappears. "If plain water bores you, try adding in mint, lemon, or frozen fruit to mix it up," says Lenchewski. And if that still doesn't do the trick, there's a healthier alternative to bagged chips or fries. "If you're really just craving salt after all, toasted seaweed is a great low-calorie option," she says.<br/><br/>If you're craving starchy carbs like pasta<br/><br/>It means: "Because high-carb foods boost the feel-good hormone serotonin, starch cravings can be a sign you're in need of a mood booster," says Lenchewski.<br/><br/>Instead, reach for a bath! "Bust out the Epsom salts, because it's time for some serious R+R," says Lenchewski. "Trust me. Indulging in a starch free-for-all feels really good in the moment, but it will likely bum you out more the next day." (As anyone who has ever over-indulged a pizza or pasta craving knows.) So the next time you want to dive head first into a bowl of carbs, draw a bath, light a candle, and treat yourself without any regret or dense calories.<br/><br/>If you're craving ice cream<br/><br/>5 / 6<br/><br/>It means: "Your body may be telling you it's in need of some healthy fat."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for coconut ice cream. "I'm a realist, so if you're craving ice cream, I'm not going to recommend a handful of walnuts, which are, of course, full of healthy fat," says Lenchewski. "For ice cream emergencies, I recommend lower-in-sugar coconut ice-creams like Coconut Bliss or Kippy's three-ingredient ice cream in Los Angeles." We can vouch for the fact that coconut ice cream tastes incredible and just like the real thing.<br/><br/>If you're craving a burger<br/><br/>It means: You need iron. "If you can't stop thinking about red meat, there's a chance your body is craving iron, b12 and folic acid," says Lenchewski. "This is especially true during or around that time of the month."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for a healthier burger. "I'm a proponent of grass fed, antibiotic and hormone-free red meat once a week," says Lenchewski. "Try experimenting with an open-faced bison burger—which, cut for cut, is leaner and has more iron than beef." Don't eat meat? Try to incorporate some kind of plant-based iron supplement into your routine, like spirulina. | Следете нè<br/><br/>ДАЛИ СИ ТИ<br/><br/>ИНСИДЕР<br/><br/>Сакате шеќер? Еве што вашето тело се обидува да ви каже<br/><br/>од<br/>Бирди<br/><br/>ФОТО:<br/><br/>Џаким<br/><br/>Покрај зголемувањето на телесната тежина од неконтролираните желби, може да биде фрустрирачко да имате постојана желба за нешто нездраво и да не знаете зошто. Добрата вест е дека обично постои причина за таа горлива желба да се смести торба со компири, или чувството дека всушност може да умрете ако не добиете краставици во овој момент (иако не сте бремени). Ако имате визии на барови на Млечниот Пат, на пример, тоа би можело да значи дека ви недостасува многу специфичен хранлив елемент во вашата исхрана. (Да — тоа е покомплицирано од реченото дека чоколадниот бар е толку проклето вкусен.)<br/><br/>Разговаравме со диететичарот Шира Ленчевски, М.С., Р.Д., со седиште во Лос Анџелес, за да добие слаби на некои вообичаени желби за храна, како и што можете да направите за да го заситите гладот без да претерате. Продолжете да се движите за некои сериозно добри информации!<br/><br/>Ако сакате чоколадо<br/><br/>Тоа значи: Може да ви недостасува магнезиум во вашата исхрана, вели Ленчевски. "Магнезиумот е суштински минерал вклучен во производството на енергија, метаболизмот на гликозата и мускулната функција. Ова е особено точно за оние кои ја удираат салата тешко", објаснува таа. Покрај тоа, нивото на магнезиум се намалува за време на предменструалните недели од вашиот период, што објаснува зошто ПМС толку често доаѓа со чоколаден апетит.<br/><br/>Наместо тоа, посегнете по висококвалитетно темно чоколадо со ниско ниво на шеќер, кое природно е високо во магнезиум. „Препорачувам да се држите до 75 отсто какао или повисоко и да го споите со друг извор богат со магнезиум, како што се семињата на сончогледот“, вели Ленчевски. Таа предлага чоколаден бренд Ху, компанија за храна со мала серија која се фокусира на висококвалитетни состојки произведени на локално ниво. „Тоа е малку скапо, но уште повеќе причина да се држат делови под контрола“, вели таа. „Тоа е мојата лична омилена.“ Ние исто така сме големи обожаватели на суперхрана спакувани Zenbunni.<br/><br/>Ако сакате бонбони<br/><br/>Тоа значи: „Жедникот за чист шеќер е добар показател дека ви снемува енергија“, вели Ленчевски. „Размислете за тоа. Што е единственото нешто за кое чешате по ужасен ноќен сон или околу 4 часот попладне за време на стресен работен ден? Одговорот обично е шеќер, бидејќи се користи како инстант гориво за клетките на нашето тело.<br/><br/>Наместо тоа, посегнете по јаболка со путер од ореви. "Ако напаѓате залихи од бонбони на вашите соработници, препорачувам повеќе јаглени хидрати со бавно горење со извор на масти или протеини", вели Ленчевски. За разлика од едноставниот шеќер, ова ќе ги нахрани вашите клетки додека избегнувате несреќа по шеќерот. Две опции кои прават одлични избори следниот пат кога ќе посакувате бонбони: нарезано јаболко со путер од ореви или бобинки со 2% незасладен грчки јогурт. Ние исто така сакаме да го скршиме слаткиот заб со овие зависни кокосови чипови - тие се полнат, без додаден шеќер и само толку добри.<br/><br/>Ако сакате сол<br/><br/>Тоа значи: „Ако ништо друго освен најсолениот краставички нема да направи, можеби нема да пиете доволно H2O“, вели Ленчевски. „Солта му помага на телото да се држи до водата, па затоа копнееме за неа кога ни требаат течности.“<br/><br/>Наместо тоа, посегнете по вода. „Останете хидрирани, особено како што се приближуваме до летните месеци“, вели таа. Следниот пат кога ќе ја погоди желбата, обидете се да ја угасите (буквално) со неколку освежувачки чаши и можеби ќе ја најдете итноста на натриумот. "Ако обичната вода ви досадува, обидете се да додадете нане, лимон или замрзнато овошје за да го измешате", вели Ленчевски. И ако тоа сеуште не го прави трикот, постои поздрава алтернатива на вреќи чипс или помфрит. "Ако навистина сте само копнеж за сол, на крајот на краиштата, тост морски алги е одлична опција со ниска калорија", вели таа.<br/><br/>Ако сте копнеж скробни јаглехидрати како тестенини<br/><br/>Тоа значи: "Бидејќи храната со високо ниво на јаглехидрати го зголемува нивото на хормонот серотонин, апетитот за скроб може да биде знак дека ви е потребен засилувач на расположението", вели Ленчевски.<br/><br/>Наместо тоа, посегнете по бања! "Извадете ги солите од Епсом, бидејќи е време за некој сериозен R + R", вели Ленчевски. "Верувај ми. Да се препуштиш на скроб бесплатно за сите се чувствува навистина добро во моментот, но најверојатно ќе те извади повеќе следниот ден." (Како што знае секој што некогаш премногу уживал во пица или тестенини.) Значи, следниот пат кога ќе сакате да се нурнете прво во чинија со јаглехидрати, нацртајте бања, запалете свеќа и третирајте се без никакво жалење или густи калории.<br/><br/>Ако сакате сладолед<br/><br/>5 / 6<br/><br/>Тоа значи: "Вашето тело можеби ви кажува дека му треба некоја здрава маст."<br/><br/>Наместо тоа, посегнете по кокосов сладолед. „Јас сум реалист, па ако сакате сладолед, нема да препорачувам неколку ореви, кои се, се разбира, полни со здрави масти“, вели Ленчевски. "За итни случаи со сладолед, препорачувам сладолед со ниско ниво на шеќер, како што е Coconut Bliss или сладолед со три состојки на Кипи во Лос Анџелес." Можеме да гарантираме за фактот дека сладоледот од кокос има неверојатен вкус и само како вистинската работа.<br/><br/>Ако сакате хамбургер<br/><br/>Тоа значи: Ви треба железо. „Ако не можете да престанете да размислувате за црвено месо, постои шанса вашето тело да копнее по железо, b12 и фолна киселина“, вели Ленчевски. „Ова е особено точно за време или околу тоа време од месецот.“<br/><br/>Наместо тоа, посегнете по поздрав хамбургер. „Јас сум заговорник на трева, антибиотици и црвено месо без хормони еднаш неделно“, вели Ленчевски. „Обидете се да експериментирате со хамбургер со бизон со отворено лице - кој, исечен за сечење, е потенок и има повеќе железо отколку говедско месо.“ Не јадете месо? Обидете се да вклучите некој вид на железо базирано на растенија во вашата рутина, како што е спирулина. |

| Web Services, Vendors And Cyber Laws!<br/><br/>Updated On:April 21, 2014Bilal Ahmad<br/><br/>Computerization of this world changed human performance scenario to a great extent and that too beyond measurement. For instance, Now you can send vital information all across the globe with a single mouse click, thanks to internet connectivity. Sadly, it is this wide connectivity and popularity among people, internet has also increased chances for computer crimes. Internet crimes or computer crimes are widely known as 'Cyber Crimes'.<br/><br/>'Cyber Laws' is something new in the judiciary system but has gained a lot of attention lately. The term cyber crime is something very synonymous with conventional crime, the only difference being medium of execution. There are majorly two types of cyber crimes, the first one is in which computers are the main targets and these include cases of data damage, malicious code and even criminal data access. The second one is in which computer is only a tool using which conventional crimes are committed for eg cyber terrorism, spamming, cyber stalking and many more.<br/><br/>This is where a website consultant or a vendor comes into scene. Although not aware of all the cyber laws present till date, a website vendor can advise you on some of the most vital cyber laws while creating your site.<br/><br/>This may include common knowledge of copy rights or even protecting the content of your own website. Explaining you all the rights you posses as a website owner is also one the tasks a website vendor may do while developing your website. A vendor can also assist you by offering you information on different cyber laws to protect data. Besides all of this, a vendor can also offer you information on any new cyber law that you may not be aware of till know. Cyber laws may vary from nation to nation, one recent example can be of the cookie law released in the United Kingdom, which prevents the website from saving any user browsing data. As per the Cookie Law, websites in the United Kingdom cannot save cookie files without informational consent from the surfer.<br/><br/>It is after the implementation of such law, websites now have a pop-up window, which seeks the consent of the visitor for saving cookies files. Such files are used by websites to analyze the browsing pattern of visitors based on which advertisements are then posted on a user window. With hacking not anymore a new thing for all of us, do you think such rules and regulations can prevent online forgery or cyber crime? Technology has developed at a rapid rate but still people do not prefer shopping online due to fear of personal or bank account details getting hacked. With the rise of cyber crime, need of stringent cyber laws have also increased to curb the same and to promote a risk free shopping experience.<br/><br/>Classes of Cyber Crimes<br/><br/>Over the years there have been three major classes of cyber crimes:<br/><br/>Unauthorized access of computer system cases, which involves hacking or stealing usernames and passwords to gain access over personal information of the respective user. These kind of backdoor access are organized with the help of Trojan Horse. Releasing malicious programs like Trojan House, worms or computer viruses etc. The last class includes cyber stalking a user or online harassment .<br/><br/>Direct implications of Cyber crimes<br/><br/>Decrease in sales<br/><br/>Decrease in staff output due to network delays<br/><br/>Loss of personalized information like research work<br/><br/>Disruption in communication process<br/><br/>Indirect implications of Cyber crimes<br/><br/>Credibility issue in our financial system<br/><br/>Brand image is tarnished in the market<br/><br/>Cyber crimes affect business to business relationship in the market<br/><br/>Sense of trust in state policies and government agencies is lost<br/><br/>Preventing Cyber Crime<br/><br/>As netizens there are certain precautions that we should consider for a safe and secure online experience. Here are some of them:<br/><br/>First thing to do will be to keep personal information to your self and avoid sharing the same online.<br/><br/>Avoid sharing any photographs with online chat friends or strangers.<br/><br/>Installing latest version of anti-virus on your system can offer you a good line of defense against internet threats like viruses and malware.<br/><br/>Keeping back up of your valuable data is a good option to avoid problems like virus contamination.<br/><br/>Avoid sending credit card information to sites that are unsecured and don't have any valid certificate.<br/><br/>Installing safety programme that offers you control over site cookies and saves you from being tracked by websites.<br/><br/>Putting host-based intrusions detection devices on servers will help you keep track of irregularities on your website traffic.<br/><br/>Use of firewall is advised.<br/><br/>Why Cyber attacks are so popular?<br/><br/>Cheaper than traditional cheating methods<br/><br/>Tracking cyber crimes are not easy<br/><br/>Exact locations cannot be tracked easily<br/><br/>Absence of physical barrier in the internet world<br/><br/>Cyber crimes affect large number of people<br/><br/>Conclusion<br/><br/>The fact that human mind has unfathomable power is undeniable, which is why internet crimes are increasing at a tremendous rate. Even history has witnessed some of the greatest internet security gone kaput by the hands of hackers, who have easily got away too. The only way to curb such crime is to remain aware of the cyber laws that we have today, that can either be through internet or through website/IT vendors. Information Technology Act has to be balanced in such a way that it proves too stringent for people who are involved in cyber crimes and at the same time it should never hamper the growth of Internet industry.<br/><br/>Author Bio:– Maneet Puri at present is heading a quality web design firm located at New Delhi, India.

На пример, Сега можете да испратите витални информации низ целиот свет со еден клик на глувчето, благодарение на интернет конекција. За жал, тоа е оваа широка поврзаност и популарност меѓу луѓето, интернет, исто така, има зголемени шанси за компјутерски криминал. Интернет криминал или компјутерски криминал се широко познати како "сајбер криминал".<br/><br/>"Сајбер закони" е нешто ново во судскиот систем, но во последно време доби многу внимание. Терминот сајбер криминал е нешто многу синоним за конвенционалниот криминал, единствената разлика е средството за извршување. Постојат главно два вида сајбер криминал, првиот е во кој компјутерите се главните цели и тие вклучуваат случаи на оштетување на податоци, малициозен код, па дури и пристап до криминални податоци. Вториот е во кој компјутерот е само алатка со која се извршуваат конвенционалните злосторства за сајбер тероризам, спам, сајбер следење и многу повеќе.<br/><br/>Ова е местото каде што веб-сајт консултант или продавач доаѓа на сцената. Иако не се свесни за сите сајбер закони присутни до денес, веб-сајт продавач може да ве советува за некои од најважните сајбер закони при креирање на вашиот сајт.<br/><br/>Ова може да вклучува заедничко познавање на правата за копирање или дури и заштита на содржината на вашата веб-страница. Објаснувањето на сите права што ги поседувате како сопственик на веб-страница е исто така една од задачите што продавачот на веб-страница може да ги направи при развојот на вашата веб-страница. Продавачот исто така може да ви помогне со тоа што ќе ви понуди информации за различни сајбер закони за заштита на податоците. Покрај сето ова, продавачот исто така може да ви понуди информации за секој нов сајбер закон што можеби не сте свесни за дознаете. Сајбер законите може да се разликуваат од нација до нација, еден неодамнешен пример може да биде законот за колачиња објавен во Обединетото Кралство, кој го спречува веб-сајтот да ги зачувува податоците за прелистување на корисниците. Според Законот за колачиња, веб-страниците во Обединетото Кралство не можат да зачувуваат датотеки со колачиња без информативна согласност од сурферот.<br/><br/>Тоа е по спроведувањето на таков закон, веб-сајтови сега имаат pop-up прозорец, кој бара согласност на посетителот за зачувување на датотеки со колачиња. Таквите датотеки се користат од страна на веб-страниците за да се анализира моделот на прелистување на посетителите врз основа на кои реклами потоа се објавуваат на прозорецот на корисникот. Со хакирањето повеќе не е нова работа за сите нас, дали мислите дека таквите правила и регулативи можат да спречат онлајн фалсификување или сајбер криминал? Технологијата се развила со брза стапка, но сепак луѓето не претпочитаат да купуваат онлајн поради страв од хакирање на лични или банкарски детали.
