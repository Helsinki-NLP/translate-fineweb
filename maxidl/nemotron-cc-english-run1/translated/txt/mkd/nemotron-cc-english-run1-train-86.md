| Leclaire<br/><br/>The historic Leclaire neighborhood, once referred to as Edwardsville's "suburb to the south," was founded as a cooperative community in 1890 and remained a separate village until annexed to the city of Edwardsville in 1934. Newspapers and magazines throughout the United States and Europe reported on the Leclaire experiment, particularly during the first 20 years of its existence. In 1979, due to its unique history, the former village was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.<br/><br/>Leclaire was founded by Nelson Oliver Nelson, a St. Louis plumbing manufacturer who, for many years, sought to advance the plight of the working class. Nelson wanted to improve working conditions for his employees and provide housing near the factories so workers and their families could easily participate in recreational and educational programs offered free of charge by the company. Prior to 1890, while still in St. Louis, the N. O. Nelson Company's manufacturing and distribution businesses began providing profit sharing along with educational and recreational opportunities. The Leclaire cooperative experiment would bring additional benefits.<br/><br/>When Nelson employees indicated they wanted to relocate to a rural location, company representatives approached leaders of small towns in several Missouri and Illinois communities near their St. Louis headquarters. They were looking for a suitable property to build new factories and a model village. South of Edwardsville they found a 125-acre tract of land with access to water, coal, and transportation. Local businessmen acted quickly to offer a financial incentive. In less than three weeks, the community raised a fund of $20,000 from individual contributions of between $1 and $1,000 to entice Nelson to choose Edwardsville for his enterprise.<br/><br/>City leaders had hoped to locate property inside the city limits of Edwardsville, but when no suitable site could be found, they were confident that the Nelson investment south of town would soon become a part of Edwardsville. Although Nelson fulfilled all the contingencies for construction and job creation in his contract, it would be 44 years before annexation to Edwardsville. Leclaire, bounded by Madison/Brown Avenues to the east, the railroad tracks to the west, Hadley/McKinley Avenues on the south and Wolf Street to the north, remained an independent village from 1890 to 1934. During that time it earned a reputation for innovations in business, education and residential planning.<br/><br/>The village of Leclaire on a 1931 map of Edwardsville<br/>Courtesy of Paul Jenkins<br/><br/>Nelson's decision to build a village was not made on a whim. By the late 1880s he was an international leader in the fields of cooperation and profit-sharing, exchanging social theories with others around the world while expanding his St. Louis business. He named his experimental village after the Parisian profit-sharer, Edme Jean Leclaire, but he visited many other social visionaries who provided information and inspiration. Compiling the best ideas from these examples, Nelson founded Leclaire to, in his words, "give work, promote intelligence, provide recreation, foster beauty, and make homes." These were all factors he determined necessary for men to lead fulfilling lives. Later writers used these words to formulate Leclaire's founding principles: Work, Homes, Education, Recreation, and Beauty, but with the additional important principle of Freedom.<br/><br/>Work<br/><br/>Work could be considered the most important of these factors since without the factory jobs in Leclaire, there would be no village. The brick factory buildings were designed by architect E. A. Cameron to provide natural light, ventilation in the summer, and heated floors in the winter. There was a fire suppression system and, although industrial accidents were not eliminated, every effort was made to guarantee the safety of the workers. The ivy-covered brick buildings were surrounded by well-manicured lawns and flower gardens giving the complex a campus-like appearance. In 1894, New York World reporter Nellie Bly called the buildings "the ideal perfection of buildings for man to labor in".<br/><br/>The manufacturing complex of the N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company in Leclaire<br/>From Friends of Leclaire<br/><br/>Nelson company policies were designed to protect the financial stability of employees. Workers could earn a share of the profits and have a voice in the company if they chose that option. The profit-sharing plan gave Nelson employees a pride of ownership that resulted in a supportive workforce. There were a few short-lived labor strikes over the years, but for the most part, labor problems were rare. Workers also had reasonable hours and competitive wages. There was a provident fund that provided for pensions and sick leave, as well as widow pensions if a worker died, whether or not the death was related to his employment.<br/><br/>Company headquarters for the N. O. Nelson Company (NONCO) remained in St. Louis, but all of the N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company was moved to Leclaire. The manufacturing company was divided into shops that made a variety of products. In 1900, the shops became independent companies for tax purposes, but all were still owned by the N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company. The shops included the Cabinet Mill where wood products from cabinetry to millwork were produced. The skilled craftsmen that worked here also fulfilled special contracts, including teller cages for a local bank and an altar still in use at St. Andrew's Episcopal Church in Edwardsville. The Marble Shop specialized in architectural marble that was cut and installed by Nelson crews in homes, businesses, and even state capitols throughout the Midwest. The Machine Shop, which became Bignall and Keeler, made pipe fitting machines, pumps, gauges, and various mechanical tools expected in the plumbing trade. They also branched out to manufacture specialty items like the Leclaire Bicycle in the mid-1890s. The Brass Shop included a foundry where various plumbing pipes and tools were manufactured. These examples represent just some of the work done in the Leclaire factories. The company's logo was a stylized "NONCO" that can still be seen on plumbing fixtures and some fire hydrants in Edwardsville today.<br/><br/>Homes<br/><br/>Before homes could be built, housing was needed for workers who were completing the factory buildings as well as building homes. To meet those needs, the company built the "Club House," a large building that served many purposes. In addition to lodging, it was the community's first educational building, and it contained a well-stocked library.<br/><br/>Construction of the residential portion of Leclaire began immediately after the village was founded in June of 1890. Julius Pitzman, the innovative landscape architect who laid out the first lots in Leclaire, set them up with a number of protective covenants. The covenants provided for wide, curvilinear streets, large lots, and a deed restriction that limited the properties to residential or educational purposes only. The company paved the streets, provided electric street lights, installed sidewalks, and planted hundreds of trees along the streets of Leclaire. Later sections of Leclaire were laid out with a conventional grid design and smaller lots, but still included the deed restrictions.<br/><br/>A Leclaire Victorian cottage in 1907<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Initially the homes were built by the company and then sold at near cost to Nelson employees to encourage home ownership. If a worker became ill and could not make his mortgage, payments were suspended until after he returned to work. The homes were offered in a variety of house designs and the company advertised that no two dwellings were alike. The earliest homes were primarily Victorian cottages that came with electricity and running water. These were followed by bungalows, foursquares, and even some kit homes. Residents could purchase a company-built home or buy an empty lot and build a house themselves, provided the architectural design met company standards.<br/><br/>In later years, lots were sold to investors, usually Edwardsville residents, and many homes in the 1920s were built by local contractors who then sold them to area residents.<br/><br/>Education<br/><br/>Nelson believed in education for everyone, including the working class. Educational programming began with a kindergarten at the Club House in 1892 and continued in the new educational building at 722 Holyoake Road. Commonly called the "School House," this building provided a large hall for meetings and programs, but had moveable partitions to divide it into classroom space during the day. In the evenings, there were dances, meetings, or programs of the Leclaire Self-Culture Club which featured weekly lectures by Washington University professors or nationally known speakers who, like N. O. Nelson, were part of the social betterment movement at the turn of the century. These included Jane Addams, Edward Everett Hale, Samuel "Golden Rule" Jones, and author Charlotte Perkins Gilman, among others.<br/><br/>Children enrolled in the Leclaire kindergarten in 1913<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>In the ten years following the 1895 construction of the education building, there were a series of educational experiments including an industrial school, college, night school, and an academy. The earliest and longest-lived endeavor was the morning kindergarten, founded in 1892, that used the Fröbel Model. This two-year program was free to everyone, including Edwardsville children, until 1931 when for financial reasons the company began charging tuition to students who were not the children of employees. Nelson Manufacturing operated a kindergarten until 1934 when the building was turned over to the Edwardsville School District for a nominal fee.<br/><br/>Recreation<br/><br/>Boaters on Leclaire Lake in 1915<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Recreation was an important feature of Leclaire. The company provided sports facilities for baseball, tennis, and later, football. A bowling and billiard hall was constructed and there was a lake for boating, swimming, fishing, or ice skating in winter. Leclaire Park was furnished with boathouses, male & female bath houses, and a large pavilion. Residents organized dances, hayrides, spelling bees, and other activities, and the company sponsored a band that played regularly at entertainments in the village or in Edwardsville. Like the educational functions at the Club House and School House, the recreational facilities at Leclaire were open to all and were often a destination for Edwardsville and even St. Louis visitors.<br/><br/>Beauty<br/><br/>Early photograph of Leclaire Lake<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>The last of the factors Nelson deemed important for a satisfying life concerned the environment. Nelson knew about the importance of healthy living. He valued the beauty and cleanliness that could be found in the country, and encouraged all in Leclaire to beautify their property by planting gardens and orchards. Nelson himself led by example, so a company greenhouse provided free flowers and competitions were held for the most beautiful yards. Leclaire was laid out so that the entire village had a park-like setting still evident today.<br/><br/>Freedom<br/><br/>The Leclaire Cooperative store<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Nelson listed five founding principles for Leclaire, but modern writers add a sixth: Freedom. All of the programs offered by the company were available to employees as well as local residents, but none were mandatory. The freedom to choose whether or not to participate in company programs was entirely up to the individual. Residents of Leclaire could work for Nelson Manufacturing or elsewhere, and workers were under no obligation to live in Leclaire. Participation in recreational and educational programs was also optional. There was also a company store where employees could shop, but unlike other company towns, no one was in debt to the company store. The Leclaire Store was a cooperative where members were charged fair market prices, but were then paid quarterly dividends.<br/><br/>A Different Company Town<br/><br/>All of these benefits made Leclaire unique from other company towns. But there were also individual instances where the company showed compassion and care for the employees. The company closed the factories and hired excursion trains to take workers and their families to St. Louis for a day at the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair. When money was tight, Nelson would occasionally place extra cash in each pay envelope to make life easier for workers, and if he instituted a program the men did not agree with, they talked it out and, as often as not, Nelson would reverse himself.<br/><br/>Born in Lillesand, Norway, in 1841, N. O. Nelson was a complicated man. He was a capitalist who believed in free enterprise, but also a socialist, a follower of the "Golden Rule", and a patriot who served for the Union in the Civil War. By 1900, he was a multimillionaire, but by the time of his death in 1922, he had given it all away for the betterment of the working class.<br/><br/>Although Leclaire was not Nelson's only social experiment, it is considered his most successful endeavor. Other major efforts for social betterment included a chain of co-operative grocery stores in New Orleans, a kindergarten for the children of black employees in his Bessemer, Alabama, factories, and a home for consumptives in Indio, California.<br/><br/>Nelson's Village of Leclaire was renowned internationally as a noteworthy and successful experiment. It was described in the New York World on numerous occasions but in particular by reporter Nellie Bly in 1894 who wrote at length about the model town where "The labor question is solved and everybody happy in a little village near St. Louis." The Los Angeles Times also regularly reported on N. O. Nelson, as did the Chicago Daily Tribune and numerous other publications.<br/><br/>In a speech at Leclaire's 15th anniversary celebration in 1915, Nelson said, "Leclaire extends to you a wide open hospitality, and bids you enjoy today the ease and comfort and beauty and inspiration which we enjoy every day." More than a century has passed since that day, but the invitation still stands. Residents and researchers are invited to learn about Leclaire's history and consider the lessons that might be learned for the betterment of future generations.<br/><br/>One of the former buildings of the manufacturing complex in 2019, which now serves as the N. O. Nelson Campus of Lewis and Clark Community College<br/>Photo by Ben Ostermeier<br/><br/>Friends of Leclaire, organized in 1990 following Leclaire's Centennial celebration, promotes the history of Leclaire through a website (historic-leclaire.org), publications, and a festival, Leclaire Parkfest, held annually on the third Sunday in October | Леклер<br/><br/>Историската населба Леклер, некогаш наречена „предградие на Едвардсвил на југ“, била основана како кооперативна заедница во 1890 година и останала посебно село сè додека не била припоена кон градот Едвардсвил во 1934 година. Весниците и списанијата низ Соединетите Држави и Европа известуваа за Леклеровиот експеримент, особено во текот на првите 20 години од неговото постоење. Во 1979 година, поради својата уникатна историја, поранешното село било впишано во Националниот регистар на историски места.<br/><br/>Leclaire е основана од Нелсон Оливер Нелсон, производител на водовод во Сент Луис, кој со години се обидувал да ја унапреди состојбата на работничката класа. Нелсон сакал да ги подобри условите за работа за своите вработени и да обезбеди сместување во близина на фабриките, така што работниците и нивните семејства лесно можеле да учествуваат во рекреативни и образовни програми понудени бесплатно од компанијата. Пред 1890 година, додека сè уште бил во Сент Луис, компаниите за производство и дистрибуција на компанијата N.O. Nelson започнале да обезбедуваат споделување на профит заедно со образовни и рекреативни можности. Кооперативниот експеримент на Леклер ќе донесе дополнителни придобивки.<br/><br/>Кога вработените на Нелсон најавиле дека сакаат да се преселат на рурална локација, претставниците на компанијата им пристапиле на лидерите на мали градови во неколку заедници во Мисури и Илиноис во близина на нивното седиште во Сент Луис. Тие барале соодветен имот за изградба на нови фабрики и модел на село. Јужно од Едвардсвил тие нашле 125 хектари земјиште со пристап до вода, јаглен и транспорт. Локалните бизнисмени дејствувале брзо за да понудат финансиски поттик. За помалку од три недели, заедницата собрала фонд од 20.000 долари од поединечни придонеси од помеѓу 1 и 1.000 долари за да го привлече Нелсон да го избере Едвардсвил за својот потфат.<br/><br/>Градските лидери се надевале дека ќе го лоцираат имотот во границите на градот Едвардсвил, но кога не можеле да најдат соодветна локација, тие биле сигурни дека Нелсоновата инвестиција јужно од градот наскоро ќе стане дел од Едвардсвил. Иако Нелсон ги исполнил сите услови за изградба и создавање на работни места во неговиот договор, тоа би било 44 години пред анексијата на Едвардсвил. Леклер, ограничен со Медисон/Браун авениите на исток, железничките пруги на запад, Хедли/МекКинли авениите на југ и Волф стрит на север, останале независно село од 1890 до 1934 година. Во тоа време тој стекна репутација за иновации во бизнисот, образованието и станбеното планирање.<br/><br/>Селото Леклер на мапата на Едвардсвил од 1931 година<br/>Со љубезна дозвола на Пол Џенкинс<br/><br/>Одлуката на Нелсон да изгради село не била направена од каприц. До крајот на 1880-тите тој бил меѓународен лидер во областа на соработката и споделувањето на профитот, разменувајќи социјални теории со другите ширум светот додека го проширувал својот бизнис во Сент Луис. Своето експериментално село го именувал по парискиот профитер Едме Жан Леклер, но тој посетил многу други социјални визионери кои обезбедувале информации и инспирација. Собирајќи ги најдобрите идеи од овие примери, Нелсон го основал Леклер за да, според неговите зборови, „дава работа, промовира интелигенција, обезбедува рекреација, негува убавина и гради домови“. Подоцнежните писатели ги користеле овие зборови за да ги формулираат основните принципи на Леклер: работа, домови, образование, рекреација и убавина, но со дополнителен важен принцип на слобода.<br/><br/>Работа<br/><br/>Работата може да се смета за најважниот од овие фактори, бидејќи без работните места во фабриката во Леклер, немаше да има село. Зградите на фабриката за тули биле дизајнирани од архитектот Е. А. Камерон за да обезбедат природна светлина, вентилација во лето и подови со подно греење во зима. Постоел систем за гаснење на пожари и иако индустриските несреќи не биле елиминирани, биле направени сите напори за да се гарантира безбедноста на работниците. Зградите од тули покриени со бршљан биле опкружени со добро уредени тревници и цветни градини што му давале на комплексот изглед сличен на кампусот. Во 1894 година, Њујоршкиот светски репортер Нели Блај ги нарекол зградите „идеално совршенство на зградите за човекот да работи во“.<br/><br/>Производствениот комплекс на N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company во Leclaire<br/>Пријатели на Leclaire<br/><br/>Полисите на компанијата Нелсон беа дизајнирани да ја заштитат финансиската стабилност на вработените. Работниците можеа да заработат дел од профитот и да имаат глас во компанијата ако ја изберат таа опција. Планот за поделба на профитот им даде на вработените на Нелсон гордост на сопственоста што резултираше со поддршка на работната сила. Имаше неколку краткотрајни штрајкови на трудот во текот на годините, но во најголем дел, проблемите со трудот беа ретки. Работниците исто така имале разумни часови и конкурентни плати. Постоел фонд за осигурување кој обезбедувал пензии и боледување, како и пензии за вдовици ако работникот умрел, без разлика дали смртта била поврзана со неговото вработување.<br/><br/>Седиштето на компанијата за N. O. Nelson Company (NONCO) остана во Сент Луис, но сите N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company беше преместен во Leclaire. Производствената компанија беше поделена на продавници кои направија различни производи. Во 1900 година, продавниците станале независни компании за даночни цели, но сите сè уште биле во сопственост на N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company. Продавниците вклучувале Кабинетот Мил каде што се произведувале производи од дрво од кабинети до мелница. Квалификуваните занаетчии кои работеле тука, исто така, ги исполниле посебните договори, вклучувајќи ги и кафезите за локална банка и олтарот кој сè уште се користи во епископската црква Свети Андреј во Едвардсвил. Мермерната продавница била специјализирана за архитектонски мермер кој бил исечен и инсталиран од екипите на Нелсон во домовите, бизнисите, па дури и во државните престолнини низ Средниот Запад. Машинската продавница, која станала Бигнал и Килер, направила цевководни машини, пумпи, мерила и разни механички алатки што се очекувале во водоводната трговија. Тие исто така се разграничиле за да произведуваат специјални предмети како велосипедот Leclaire во средината на 1890-тите. Продавницата за месинг вклучувала леарница каде што се произведувале разни водоводни цевки и алатки. Овие примери претставуваат само дел од работата извршена во фабриките на Леклер. Логото на компанијата било стилизирано "НОНКО" кое сè уште може да се види на водоводните тела и некои пожарни хидранти во Едвардсвил денес.<br/><br/>Куќи<br/><br/>Пред да може да се изградат куќи, потребни беа куќи за работниците кои ги завршуваа фабричките згради, како и за изградба на куќи. За да ги задоволи овие потреби, компанијата ја изгради "Клубната куќа", голема зграда која служеше за многу цели. Покрај сместувањето, тоа била првата образовна зграда во заедницата и содржела добро зачувана библиотека.<br/><br/>Изградбата на станбениот дел на Леклер започнала веднаш по основањето на селото во јуни 1890 година. Џулиус Пицман, иновативниот пејзажен архитект кој ги поставил првите парцели во Леклер, ги поставил со голем број заштитни завети. Договорите предвидувале широки, криволинеарни улици, големи парцели и ограничување на имотот што ги ограничувало имотот само за станбени или образовни цели. Компанијата ги поплочувала улиците, обезбедувала електрични улични светла, инсталирала тротоари и засадила стотици дрвја по улиците на Леклер. Подоцнежните делови на Леклер биле поставени со конвенционален дизајн на мрежата и помали делови, но сепак ги вклучувале ограничувањата на делото.<br/><br/>Викторијанската колиба Леклер во 1907 година<br/>Синди Рајнхард<br/><br/>Првично, куќите биле изградени од страна на компанијата, а потоа продадени по речиси трошоци на вработените во Нелсон за да се поттикне сопственоста на домот. Ако работникот се разболел и не можел да ја направи својата хипотека, плаќањата биле суспендирани сè додека не се вратил на работа. Куќите биле понудени во различни дизајни на куќи и компанијата рекламирала дека нема два станови слични. Најраните домови биле првенствено викторијански куќи кои доаѓале со струја и течна вода. Овие биле проследени со бунгалови, четириквадрати, па дури и некои комплет домови. Жителите можеле да купат куќа изградена од компанијата или да купат празен дел и сами да изградат куќа, под услов архитектонски дизајн да ги исполнува стандардите на компанијата.<br/><br/>Во подоцнежните години, парцели биле продавани на инвеститори, обично жители на Едвардсвил, а многу куќи во 1920-тите биле изградени од локални изведувачи кои потоа ги продавале на жителите на областа.<br/><br/>Едукација<br/><br/>Нелсон верувал во образованието за сите, вклучувајќи ја и работничката класа. Образовното програмирање започнало со градинка во Клубската куќа во 1892 година и продолжило во новата образовна зграда на 722 Holyoake Road. Вообичаено наречена „Училишна куќа“, оваа зграда обезбедувала голема сала за состаноци и програми, но имала подвижни прегради за да ја подели во училница во текот на денот. Во вечерните часови, имаше танци, состаноци или програми на Клубот за само-култура на Леклер, кој вклучуваше неделни предавања од професори од Универзитетот Вашингтон или национално познати говорници кои, како Н. О. Нелсон, беа дел од движењето за социјално подобрување на почетокот на векот. Меѓу нив биле Џејн Адамс, Едвард Еверет Хејл, Семјуел „Златното правило“ Џонс и авторката Шарлот Перкинс Гилман, меѓу другите.<br/><br/>Децата запишани во градинка Леклер во 1913 година<br/>Синди Рајнхард<br/><br/>Во десетте години по изградбата на зградата во 1895 година, имало серија образовни експерименти, вклучувајќи индустриско училиште, колеџ, ноќно училиште и академија. Најраниот и најдолготраен напор била утринската градинка, основана во 1892 година, која го користела Фребеловиот модел. Оваа двегодишна програма била бесплатна за сите, вклучувајќи ги и децата од Едвардсвил, сè до 1931 година, кога од финансиски причини компанијата почнала да наплаќа школарина за студентите кои не биле деца на вработените. Нелсон Мануфактуринг работел во детска градинка до 1934 година, кога зградата била префрлена во училишниот округ Едвардсвил за номинална такса.<br/><br/>рекреација<br/><br/>Бродови на езерото Леклер во 1915 година<br/>Синди Рајнхард<br/><br/>Рекреацијата била важна карактеристика на Леклер. Компанијата обезбедила спортски објекти за бејзбол, тенис, а подоцна и фудбал. Била изградена сала за куглање и билијар и имало езеро за чамец, пливање, риболов или лизгање на мраз во зима. Паркот Леклер бил опремен со бродски куќи, машки и женски бањи и голем павилјон. Жителите организирале танци, хајриди, правописни пчели и други активности, а компанијата спонзорирала бенд кој редовно свирел на забави во селото или во Едвардсвил. Како и образовните функции во клубската куќа и училишната куќа, рекреативните објекти во Леклер биле отворени за сите и често биле дестинација за посетителите на Едвардсвил, па дури и на Сент Луис.<br/><br/>Убавина<br/><br/>Фотографија од езерото Леклер<br/>Синди Рајнхард<br/><br/>Последниот од факторите што Нелсон ги сметал за важни за задоволувачки живот се однесувал на животната средина. Тој ја ценел убавината и чистотата што може да се најде во земјата, и ги охрабрил сите во Леклер да го украсат својот имот со садење градини и овоштарници. Самиот Нелсон предводен од пример, па една компанија стаклена градина обезбедила бесплатни цвеќиња и се одржале натпревари за најубавите дворови. Леклер бил поставен така што целото село имало поставување слично на парк сѐ уште евидентно денес.<br/><br/>Слобода<br/><br/>Кооперативната продавница Leclaire<br/>Синди Рајнхард<br/><br/>Нелсон наведе пет основни принципи за Леклер, но современите писатели додаваат шеста: Слобода. Сите програми што ги нуди компанијата беа достапни за вработените, како и локалните жители, но ниту една не беше задолжителна. Слободата да се избере дали да учествува во програмите на компанијата е целосно до поединецот. Жителите на Leclaire може да работат за Nelson Manufacturing или на друго место, а работниците не беа обврзани да живеат во Leclaire. Учеството во рекреативни и едукативни програми беше исто така опционално. Постоеше и продавница на компанијата каде што вработените можеа да купуваат, но за разлика од другите градови на компанијата, никој не беше во долгови кон продавницата на компанијата. Продавницата Леклер била кооперација каде на членовите им се наплаќале фер пазарни цени, но потоа им се исплаќале квартални дивиденди.<br/><br/>Поинаков град на компанијата<br/><br/>Сите овие придобивки го направија Leclaire уникатен од другите градови на компанијата. Но, имаше и поединечни случаи каде што компанијата покажа сочувство и грижа за вработените. Компанијата ги затворила фабриките и ангажирала екскурзиски возови за да ги однесат работниците и нивните семејства во Сент Луис за еден ден на Светскиот саем во Сент Луис во 1904 година. Кога парите биле тесни, Нелсон повремено ставал дополнителни пари во секоја платна коверта за да им го олесни животот на работниците, а ако воспоставил програма со која мажите не се согласувале, тие зборувале за тоа и, колку често не, Нелсон се превртувал.<br/><br/>Роден во Лилесанд, Норвешка, во 1841 година, Н. О. Нелсон бил комплициран човек. Тој бил капиталист кој верувал во слободно претприемништво, но исто така и социјалист, следбеник на "Златното правило" и патриот кој служел за Унијата во граѓанската војна. До 1900 година, тој бил мултимилионер, но до неговата смрт во 1922 година, тој го дал сето тоа за подобрување на работничката класа.<br/><br/>Иако Леклер не бил единствениот социјален експеримент на Нелсон, тој се смета за негов најуспешен напор. Други големи напори за социјално подобрување вклучувале синџир на кооперативни продавници во Њу Орлеанс, градинка за децата на црните вработени во неговиот Бесемер, Алабама, фабрики и дом за потрошувачи во Индио, Калифорнија.<br/><br/>Селото Леклер на Нелсон беше познато на меѓународно ниво како вреди да се забележи и успешен експеримент. Тој бил опишан во Њујорк Свет во бројни прилики, но особено од страна на репортерот Нели Блај во 1894 година, кој напишал детално за моделот на градот каде што „прашањето за трудот е решено и сите се среќни во мало село во близина на Сент Луис“. Лос Анџелес Тајмс, исто така, редовно известува за Н. О. Нелсон, како и Чикаго Дејли Трибјун и бројни други публикации.<br/><br/>Во говорот на прославата на 15-годишнината на Леклер во 1915 година, Нелсон рече: „Леклер ви проширува широко отворено гостопримство и ви нуди да уживате денес во леснотијата и удобноста, убавината и инспирацијата што ги уживаме секој ден“. Повеќе од еден век помина од тој ден, но поканата и понатаму стои. Жителите и истражувачите се поканети да дознаат за историјата на Леклер и да ги разгледаат лекциите што може да се научат за подобрување на идните генерации.<br/><br/>Една од поранешните згради на производствениот комплекс во 2019 година, која сега служи како кампусот на Н.О.

| Author Visits via Zoom or Skype<br/><br/>I'm excited to visit with your students via Zoom or Skype! Skype is a great option for schools/classes who aren't bringing in in-person authors, but who want to explore books and poetry, connect with an author, and ask one-on-one questions.<br/><br/>Cost<br/><br/>I offer 30-45-minute Zoom or Skype visits with schools for $125 per session (or $200 for two sessions happening within three hours in the morning or the afternoon; $325 for three sessions in one day; $425 for four sessions in one day). In each session, I try to get kids as actively involved as possible. No, it's not the same kind of connection as an in-person visit offers, but it can still be inspiring and motivating for kids!<br/><br/>What I Do<br/><br/>Each session for up to 50 students includes:<br/><br/>5 minutes of tech set-up<br/><br/>3 segments of 10ish-minutes each — You choose from:<br/><br/>How I became a writer<br/><br/>Writing this particular book (you choose which book I focus on)<br/><br/>Reading (I read some poems and kids help me read others)<br/><br/>Classroom presentation (your students put on a reading or performance for me—a very appreciative audience!)<br/><br/>Writing a poem together<br/><br/>Question and answer session<br/><br/>5 minutes of wrap-ups/goodbyes<br/><br/>I also chat with classes of pre-service teachers or groups of in-service teachers about poetry and writing.<br/><br/>Tips for a Great Virtual Visit<br/><br/>Tips for a Successful Virtual Visit<br/><br/>One of my goals for virtual school visits is to capture the interactivity that makes in-person visits successful and fun. But the truth is that sometimes it's tough to be virtually interactive! The timing might not sync up correctly, which makes reading together a challenge, and it's really hard for me to hear individual students unless they come up and speak directly into the microphone/computer. But after some trial and error, I've discovered some ways to have the best virtual visits possible. Here they are: 10 ways to make my visit with your students a great experience!<br/><br/>Before the Visit<br/><br/>Get kids as excited as possible about the visit. Visit my website with them. Read some of my books with them. Gather some questions students have for me. Anything you do ahead of time to make it feel like a BIG DEAL will go a long way toward student engagement.<br/><br/>Position the video camera or laptop with webcam so that I can see as much of the audience as possible. It's hard to assess student engagement when I can only see a couple of students.<br/><br/>Limit each group to 50 students. It's incredibly hard to engage large groups via video.<br/><br/>I'll move quickly from topic to topic or poem to poem. Please remind students that they'll need to listen closely to understand what's going on.<br/><br/>Occasionally, I do a little Reader's Theater with students. If I send you any scripted student parts ahead of time, print a copy for EACH session and cut into pieces, if needed.<br/><br/>During the Visit<br/><br/>When I discuss a book, if you have that printed book, please hold it up for students to see.<br/><br/>You are my proxy. I often can't call on students and hear individual replies. So, I might say, "We're going to get 3 ideas. Raise your hand if you have an idea." Then YOU take over, call on three students, and announce those answers to everyone in the room and to me.<br/><br/>Choose confident, outgoing students for scripted student parts (if I send any ahead of time). During my in-person school visits, I try to draw out some of the less confident students, but I've found that this doesn't work as well during virtual visits because I can't hear them.<br/><br/>Have students with speaking parts sit up front. When it's time, have them stand up and remind them to speak loudly.<br/><br/>In virtual visits, behavior management falls solely on you. I often can't see exactly what's going on, so do please step in as needed. If there's a big disruption, just ask me to hold on for a moment so that I don't chatter on while nobody's paying attention:>)<br/><br/>Feel free to take pictures of me on-screen and share on social media–even though pictures of me often look ridiculous because I'm making funny faces or something while I read!<br/><br/>If you have any questions at all, please just ask, either before or during the visit!<br/><br/>Scheduling a Virtual Session<br/><br/>Are you interested in scheduling a virtual visit with me? Just email me to set up a date, and we'll go from there | Автор Посети преку зумирање или Skype<br/><br/>Јас сум возбуден да го посетите со вашите ученици преку Зум или Skype! Skype е одлична опција за училишта / класи кои не се донесе во-лице автори, но кои сакаат да истражуваат книги и поезија, се поврзете со автор, и да побарате еден-на-еден прашања.<br/><br/>трошоците<br/><br/>Јас нудам 30-45-минутни зум или Skype посети со училишта за 125 долари по сесија (или 200 долари за две сесии што се случуваат во рок од три часа наутро или попладне; 325 долари за три сесии во еден ден; 425 долари за четири сесии во еден ден). Во секоја сесија, се обидувам да ги вклучам децата што е можно поактивно. Не, тоа не е ист вид на врска како што нуди посетата во лице, но сепак може да биде инспиративна и мотивирачка за децата!<br/><br/>Што правам<br/><br/>Секоја сесија за до 50 студенти вклучува:<br/><br/>5 минути од техничката инсталација<br/><br/>3 сегменти од 10ish-минута секој — Изберете од:<br/><br/>Како станав писател<br/><br/>Пишување на оваа книга (вие избирате на која книга ќе се фокусирам)<br/><br/>Читање (Јас читам некои поеми и децата ми помагаат да читам други)<br/><br/>Презентација во училницата (вашите ученици стави на читање или изведба за мене - многу благодарна публика!)<br/><br/>Заедно пишуваме поема<br/><br/>Сесија за прашања и одговори<br/><br/>5 мин. забава/збогум<br/><br/>Исто така, разговарам со класи на наставници пред-служба или групи на наставници во служба за поезија и пишување.<br/><br/>Совети за одлична виртуелна посета<br/><br/>Совети за успешна виртуелна посета<br/><br/>Една од моите цели за виртуелни училишни посети е да ја фатам интерактивноста што ги прави посети во лице успешни и забавни. Но, вистината е дека понекогаш е тешко да се биде виртуелно интерактивен! Тајмингот можеби не се синхронизира правилно, што го прави читањето заедно предизвик, и навистина ми е тешко да слушнам поединечни ученици освен ако не дојдат и не зборуваат директно во микрофонот / компјутерот. Но, по некои обиди и грешки, открив некои начини да ги имам најдобрите виртуелни посети. Еве ги: 10 начини да ја направам мојата посета со вашите студенти одлично искуство!<br/><br/>Пред посетата<br/><br/>Добијте ги децата колку што е можно возбудени за посетата. Посетете ја мојата веб-страница со нив. Прочитајте некои од моите книги со нив. Соберете некои прашања што студентите ги имаат за мене. Сè што ќе направите однапред за да се чувствувате како голем договор ќе оди долг пат кон ангажирање на студентите.<br/><br/>Поставете ја видео камерата или лаптопот со веб-камера, така што можам да видам што е можно повеќе од публиката. Тешко е да се процени ангажманот на студентите кога можам да видам само неколку студенти.<br/><br/>Ограничете ја секоја група на 50 ученици. Неверојатно е тешко да се ангажираат големи групи преку видео.<br/><br/>Ќе се движам брзо од тема на тема или поема на поема. Ве молиме потсетете ги учениците дека ќе треба внимателно да слушаат за да разберат што се случува.<br/><br/>Повремено, правам малку Reader's Theater со студентите. Ако ви испратам било какви скриптирани студентски делови однапред, испечатете копија за СЕКОЈА сесија и исечете на парчиња, ако е потребно.<br/><br/>За време на посетата<br/><br/>Кога зборувам за книга, ако ја имате испечатената книга, ве молиме држете ја за студентите да ја видат.<br/><br/>Ти си мојот посредник. Често не можам да им се јавам на студентите и да слушнам индивидуални одговори. Па, би можел да кажам, "Ќе добиеме 3 идеи. Подигнете ја раката ако имате идеја." Потоа преземете, повикајте тројца студенти и објавете ги одговорите на сите во собата и на мене.<br/><br/>Изберете самоуверени, заминува студенти за скриптирани студентски делови (ако испратам било однапред). За време на моите лични посети на училиште, се обидувам да извлечам некои од помалку сигурните ученици, но открив дека ова не функционира толку добро за време на виртуелните посети бидејќи не можам да ги слушнам.<br/><br/>Нека учениците со делови кои зборуваат седат напред. Кога е време, нека станат и да ги потсетат да зборуваат гласно.<br/><br/>Во виртуелните посети, управувањето со однесувањето паѓа исклучиво на вас. Често не можам да видам точно што се случува, па ве молиме вклучете се по потреба. Ако има голем нарушување, само побарајте од мене да се задржи за момент, така што јас не се зборува за додека никој не обрнува внимание:>)<br/><br/>Слободно фотографирајте ме на екранот и споделувајте на социјалните медиуми – иако сликите од мене често изгледаат смешно бидејќи правам смешни лица или нешто додека читам!<br/><br/>Ако имате било какви прашања, ве молиме прашајте, или пред или за време на посетата!<br/><br/>Планирање на виртуелна сесија<br/><br/>Дали сте заинтересирани за закажување виртуелна посета со мене? Само ме е-маил за да поставите датум, и ќе одиме од таму |
| News Archive<br/><br/>New book looks at ways in which to tackle HIV-challenges<br/><br/>2011-11-29<br/><br/>Prof. Dennis Francis with Marjorie Human who designed the cover of the book, Acting on HIV.<br/><br/>The HIV pandemic has brought out the best and worst in humans in terms of response. On the one hand it has prompted stigma and violence and on the other it has brought about constructive and supportive responses from various individuals and groups. A new book, Acting on HIV, edited by Prof. Dennis Francis, Dean of the Faculty of Education at the University of the Free State, looks at how drama can be used to promote vital social change as well as individual behavioural change.<br/><br/>Acting on HIV offers a systematic inquiry into drama as an approach to discuss HIV/AIDS and related attitudes and behaviours. The book is a scholarly text and includes the work of some twenty exceptionally creative authors. Contributing authors to the book include, amongst others, Proff. Hazel Barnes (University of the Witwatersrand), Rob Pattman (Stellenbosch University) and Yvonne Sliep from the University of KwaZulu-Natal.<br/><br/>"This project started in 2009 and has taken much of my time to bring together the work of exceptionally creative authors. The research that is communicated through the book is original and timely and makes a significant contribution to conversations about the role/s and significance of drama in addressing issues of HIV & AIDS," says Prof. Francis | Архива на вести<br/><br/>Новата книга ги разгледува начините за решавање на предизвиците за ХИВ<br/><br/>2011-11-29 Потрошувачка кошничка<br/><br/>Проф. Денис Френсис со Марџори Хуман, која ја дизајнираше насловната страна на книгата, Дејствување на ХИВ.<br/><br/>Пандемијата на ХИВ го донесе најдоброто и најлошото кај луѓето во однос на одговорот. Од една страна предизвика стигма и насилство, а од друга страна доведе до конструктивни и поддржувачки одговори од различни поединци и групи. Новата книга „Дејствување за ХИВ“, издадена од проф. Денис Френсис, декан на Факултетот за образование на Универзитетот на Слободната Држава, разгледува како драмата може да се искористи за промовирање на витални општествени промени, како и индивидуални промени во однесувањето.<br/><br/>Акција против ХИВ нуди систематско истражување на драмата како пристап за дискусија за ХИВ / СИДА и сродни ставови и однесувања. Книгата е научен текст и вклучува дела на околу дваесет исклучително креативни автори. Авторите кои придонесуваат за книгата се, меѓу другото, проф. Хејзел Барнс (Универзитет на Витватерсранд), Роб Патман (Универзитет Стеленбош) и Ивон Слип од Универзитетот во Квазулу-Натал.<br/><br/>„Овој проект започна во 2009 година и одзема голем дел од моето време да ги обединам делата на исклучително креативни автори. Истражувањето кое се пренесува преку книгата е оригинално и навремено и дава значаен придонес во разговорите за улогата/ите и значењето на драмата во решавањето на прашањата поврзани со ХИВ и СИДА“, вели проф. |
| Transcript of Testing the Effect of Ghost Traps on the Blue Crab, Callinectis Sapidus , in Barnegat Bay<br/><br/>Michael FranklinMarine Field Methods16 September 2008<br/><br/>I chose to use the Blue crab, Callinectus sapidus, for my experiment because it is abundant here in Barnegat Bay and it is relatively easy to catch.<br/><br/>Callinectes sapidus is a swimming crab Important to commercial soft-shell crabbers, both commercial and recreational (Jivoff 2008)Main method of crabbing is basic crab trap<br/><br/>Ghost traps occur when a trap is lost yet continues to catch organisms (Breen 1990)John Wnek says there are easily 2,000 in Barnegat BaySince C. sapidus is so aggressive (Pollock 1998) , what happens when they get stuck in cage with no food and what impact does this have?<br/><br/>If caught in a ghost trap, C. sapidus will have cannibalistic tendencies until the last one has died off from starvation.<br/><br/>How do we duplicate a ghost trap in the lab?Create ghost trap by closing of entrances with wire mesh and zip tiesOnce specimen are loaded, close off top with zip ties<br/><br/>Crab entrance closed off with wire mesh<br/><br/>Crab TrapWire MeshWire CuttersRopeCameraZip Ties<br/><br/>How do we get crabs?Trap some a few days early and starve themOnce ready to begin, collect new crabs from trapsAdd directly to ghost trap with 2 from starved tank<br/><br/>Six crabs total, one missingFound small space to escape due; patched up with zip tieTwo crabs deadOne just has claws leftOther missing both paddles and one claw<br/><br/>Four crabs alive and intactLarger dead crab has no changeSmaller dead crab has only section of carapice left<br/><br/>Last day of experimentTook two samplesNo change from second day in first sampleSecond observation, larger carapice separated from rest of body/claw<br/><br/>Based on the results, I reject my null hypothesis that the crabs will simply be in the trap. The results show that they cannibalized two crabs in the trap, then, at least for the duration of my test, were satiated.<br/><br/>Ghost traps do affect the organisms stuck in them, namely C. sapidus.C. sapidus has no problem resorting to cannibalism when no other food source is available.Cannot extrapolate my data over whole bay. | Транскрипт на тестирање на ефектот на стапиците за духови на синиот рак, Callinectis Sapidus , во заливот Барнегат<br/><br/>Мајкл ФренклинМорски теренски методи16 септември 2008<br/><br/>Избрав да го користам Синиот рак, Callinectus sapidus, за мојот експеримент, бидејќи е во изобилство тука во заливот Барнегат и релативно е лесно да се фати.<br/><br/>Callinectes sapidus е рак за пливање Важен за комерцијалните ракови со мека школка, комерцијални и рекреативни (Jivoff 2008)Главниот метод на ракување е основна стапица за ракови<br/><br/>Џон Внек вели дека има лесно 2.000 во заливот Барнегат Бидејќи C. sapidus е толку агресивен (Pollock 1998) , што се случува кога тие се заглавени во кафез без храна и какво влијание има тоа?<br/><br/>Ако е фатен во стапица на духови, C. sapidus ќе има канибалистички тенденции сè додека последниот не умре од глад.<br/><br/>Како да се дуплираат стапица дух во лабораторијата?Создадете стапица дух со затворање на влезовите со жица мрежа и zip врскиОткако примерок се вчитуваат, затвори врвот со zip врски<br/><br/>Влезот на ракот се затвори со жица<br/><br/>Рак TrapWire Mesh жица CuttersRopeКамераZip врски<br/><br/>Како да се добие ракови?Замка некои неколку дена порано и да ги изгладнатОткако ќе бидат подготвени да почнат, собираат нови ракови од стапициДодај директно во стапица за духови со 2 од изгладнети резервоарот<br/><br/>Шест ракови вкупно, еден недостасуваНајден е мал простор за бегство; закрпени со зип вратоврскаДве ракови мртвиЕден само има канџи останаДруги недостасуваат и двете лопати и една канџа<br/><br/>Четири краби живи и недопрениГолемиот мртов краб нема променаПомал мртов краб има само дел од карпа.<br/><br/>Последниот ден од експериментотЗеде два примероциБез промена од вториот ден во првиот примерокВторото набљудување, поголема карпа одделена од остатокот од телото / канџата<br/><br/>Врз основа на резултатите, ја отфрлам мојата нулта хипотеза дека раковите едноставно ќе бидат во стапица.

| Storyworld Spotlight<br/><br/>25 years of Tomb Raider<br/><br/>Tomb Raider is one of the most recognizable entertainment properties in the world. Since Lara Croft's first videogame appearance in Tomb Raider (1996), her exploits as an adventurous and quick-witted explorer have resonated widely with players, earning her a place in the pantheon of great pop culture characters. For that reason we will be putting The World of Lara Croft in the Storyworld Spotlight from December 22, 2021 to March 6, 2022.<br/><br/>Crafting a Croft<br/><br/>Lara Croft was created by studio Core Design, in Derby (UK), in 1996. The studio was looking for a lead character for their upcoming a 3D adventure game for PlayStation 1. A game in a 3rd person perspective where players would see the main character in full throughout every scene.<br/><br/>As the game was about 'raiding mysterious tombs deep under pyramids,' the lead character would need to look adventurous, and have the brains to survive complex raiding missions. After some deliberation, Lara Croft was born, a young, upper-class and utterly British woman, who was as enigmatic and intelligent as she was tough and self-reliant.<br/><br/>Success and controversy<br/><br/>Tomb Raider (1996) was a breakaway success for Core Design, who quickly doubled down on building Tomb Raider 2 (1997) and 3 (1998). A big part of the success was attributed to the games' leading lady, who found admirers both with male and female players. This baffled critics who just saw Lara Croft as a sexist cartoon.<br/><br/>Explore The World of Lara Croft in Storyworld<br/><br/>This exhibition explores the successful franchise in-depth. It looks at the history of the games and why its leading lady resonates with so many people. It also dives into the mystery of what makes Tomb Raider games tick, from the deep world building to the clever puzzles and traps, and from fantastic enemy and monster designs to the character design of the legendary heroine.<br/><br/>After all, mysteries are there to explore, and have been for the past 25 years.<br/><br/>Tickets<br/><br/>Buy your tickets for Storyworld online with a start date and entry time from Wednesday December 22.

Од првото појавување на Лара Крофт во Tomb Raider (1996), нејзините подвизи како авантуристички и брз истражувач резонираа со играчите, заработувајќи и место во пантеонот на големи ликови од поп културата. „Светот на Лара Крофт“ ќе биде во центарот на вниманието од 22 декември 2021 година до 6 март 2022 година.<br/><br/>Изработка на Крофт<br/><br/>Лара Крофт беше создадена од студиото Core Design, во Дерби (Велика Британија), во 1996 година. Студиото бараше водечки лик за нивната претстојна 3D авантура за PlayStation 1. Игра во перспектива на трето лице каде што играчите ќе го видат главниот лик во целост во секоја сцена.<br/><br/>Бидејќи играта беше за „ограбување на мистериозни гробници длабоко под пирамидите“, главниот лик ќе треба да изгледа авантуристички и да има мозок за да ги преживее сложените мисии за рација. По некое размислување, Лара Крофт е родена, млада, висока класа и целосно британска жена, која била исто толку таинствена и интелигентна колку што била цврста и самостојна.<br/><br/>Успехот и контроверзијата<br/><br/>Tomb Raider (1996) беше сепаратистички успех за Core Design, кој брзо се удвои на градење на Tomb Raider 2 (1997) и 3 (1998). Голем дел од успехот беше припишан на водечката дама на игрите, која најде обожаватели и со машки и женски играчи. Ова ги збуни критичарите кои штотуку ја гледаа Лара Крофт како сексистички цртан филм.<br/><br/>Истражете го светот на Лара Крофт во Storyworld<br/><br/>Оваа изложба ја истражува успешната франшиза во длабочина.

| Real Estate Word of the Day: Option<br/><br/>Option: An agreement to keep open, for a set period, an offer to sell or lease real property. An option can be used, for example, to give the buyer time to resolve questions of financing, title, zoning and feasibility before committing the buyer to purchase. Options are frequently used in the land assemblage process. The option must be supported by its actual consideration, separate and independent of the purchase price of the property. Mere recital of consideration alone is not sufficient except in a lease-option in which the provisions of the lease are themselves sufficient consideration to support the option. An option merely creates a contractual right; it does not give the optionee any estate in the property. At the time the option is signed, the owner does not sell, nor does the buyer purchase, the property. Although the owner is obligated to sell if given notice by the buyer, the buyer is not obligated to purchase. An option to buy is also known as a call; an option to sell is known as a put. | Недвижен имот Збор на денот: опција<br/><br/>Опција: Договор за одржување на отворено, за определен период, понуда за продажба или закуп на недвижен имот. Опцијата може да се користи, на пример, за да му даде на купувачот време да ги реши прашањата за финансирање, наслов, зонирање и изводливост пред да го ангажира купувачот за купување. Опциите често се користат во процесот на собирање на земјиштето. Опцијата мора да биде поддржана од нејзиното фактичко разгледување, одделно и независно од куповната цена на имотот. Самиот рецитал на разгледување не е доволен, освен во опцијата за закуп во која одредбите на закупот се доволни за да ја поддржат опцијата. Опцијата само создава договорно право; тоа не му дава на опцијата било каков имот во имотот. Во времето на потпишување на опцијата, сопственикот не го продава, ниту купувачот купува, имотот. Иако сопственикот е обврзан да го продаде ако му е дадено известување од страна на купувачот, купувачот не е обврзан да купува. Опцијата за купување е исто така позната како повик; опцијата за продажба е позната како пат. |
| Benefits of Carotenoids for the Skin<br/><br/>Have you heard of carotenoids? These powerful phytochemicals are the pigmented constituents found in plants that give flowers, fruits, and leaves their yellow, orange and red colours.<br/><br/>Since the 1930s, scientists have identified about 800 carotenoids and about 40 are found in the human body, including the outermost layer of the epidermis, the dermis and subcutaneous fat. The most common carotenoids are beta-carotene, alpha-carotene, lutein, zeaxanthin, lycopene, and astaxanthin. You can read more about astaxanthin here.<br/><br/>The content of carotenoids in the skin is influenced by numerous factors, including the intake of fruits and vegetables, their bioavailability from various foods, supplementation, exposure to UV radiation, air pollution, alcohol consumption, smoking and stress.<br/><br/>How do Carotenoids Help My Skin?<br/><br/>Carotenoids are some of the best-known antioxidants for the skin and they also have important functions as anti-inflammatory agents.<br/><br/>Healthy Aging and Skin Repair<br/><br/>Antioxidants are essential for healthy skin because they help to prevent free radical damage to cells. Free radical damage causes premature aging and the onset of various types of skin cancers. Carotenoids, along with vitamin E, vitamin C, and Co enzyme Q10 are important dermal antioxidants.<br/><br/>Due to their antioxidant activity, carotenoids support and encourage collagen and elastin production in the skin. This helps to increase the skin's density, thickness, elasticity, and firmness. Collagen and elastin decrease as we age, so getting enough carotenoids in the diet and topically is critical for aging well.<br/><br/>Carotenoids can improve the signs of photoaging, skin discolouration, elasticity, hydration, texture, and can reduce transepidermal water loss.<br/><br/>Astaxanthin in particular stimulates fibroblasts to produce collagen and elastin, inhibits the activity of the enzymes that breakdown collagen and elastin, and shows anti-inflammatory and UV-filtering effects. It has been shown to reduce melanin in the skin, which results in the decrease in the appearance of freckles and melasma.<br/><br/>Anti-acne activity: the anti-inflammatory activity of carotenoids helps to dampen the inflammation and irritation associated with acne. Carotenoids also help to normalize and balance oil secretions from the sebaceous glands. They are valuable agents in skin repair and they stimulate epidermal regeneration, helping to smooth and soften skin.<br/><br/>Where Can I Find Carotenoids?<br/><br/>There are two ways to get your daily dose of carotenoids: through diet and through topical application. The combination of both is the ideal approach to well-aging skincare.<br/><br/>Carotenoids are fat-soluble, so your body needs fat to absorb them (think tomatoes and olive oil, broccoli and butter, or spinach and avocado). Common sources of carotenoids in food are avocado, egg yolks, kale, spinach, carrots, sweet potatoes, papaya, and tomatoes.<br/><br/>While we advocate getting as many of your nutrients and antioxidants as you can from food rather than supplementation; one study showed that astaxanthin combined with collagen hydrolysate significantly improved barrier integrity, reduced transepidermal water loss, and increased the expression of procollagen type I mRNA.<br/><br/>Topical application is key to healthy skin. Studies show that high concentrations of antioxidants in human skin offer the best protection for healthy skin at any age.<br/><br/>At Sarka Botanicals, we blend carotenoid-rich, whole plants such as calendula, dandelion, and extracts like astaxanthin with cold-pressed oils and functional ingredients. Calendula alone contains over 19 different types of carotenoids. This may explain why it has such a long history of use in skin care. Studies show that carotenoids blended with co-enzyme Q10 are especially effective at reducing inflammation and slowing premature skin aging due to sun exposure. | Придобивки од каротеноидите за кожата<br/><br/>Дали сте слушнале за каротеноидите? Овие моќни фитохемикалии се пигментирани состојки кои се наоѓаат во растенијата кои даваат цвеќиња, овошје и ги оставаат своите жолти, портокалови и црвени бои.<br/><br/>Од 1930-тите, научниците идентификувале околу 800 каротеноиди, а околу 40 се наоѓаат во човечкото тело, вклучувајќи го и најоддалечениот слој на епидермисот, дермисот и поткожното масти. Најчестите каротеноиди се бета-каротен, алфа-каротен, лутеин, зеаксантин, ликопен и астаксантин. Можете да прочитате повеќе за астаксантин тука.<br/><br/>На содржината на каротеноидите во кожата влијаат бројни фактори, вклучувајќи го и внесот на овошје и зеленчук, нивната биорасположивост од разни видови храна, додатоци, изложеност на УВ зрачење, загадување на воздухот, конзумирање на алкохол, пушење и стрес.<br/><br/>Како каротеноидите помагаат на кожата?<br/><br/>Каротеноидите се едни од најпознатите антиоксиданси за кожата и исто така имаат важни функции како антиинфламаторни агенси.<br/><br/>Здраво стареење и поправка на кожата<br/><br/>Антиоксидансите се од суштинско значење за здрава кожа, бидејќи тие помагаат да се спречи оштетување на слободните радикали на клетките. Слободните радикали штета предизвикува предвремено стареење и појава на различни видови на рак на кожата. Каротеноидите, заедно со витаминот Е, витаминот Ц и Ко ензимот Q10 се важни дермални антиоксиданти.<br/><br/>Поради нивната антиоксидантна активност, каротеноидите го поддржуваат и поттикнуваат производството на колаген и еластин во кожата. Ова помага да се зголеми густината, дебелината, еластичноста и цврстината на кожата. Колагенот и еластинот се намалуваат како што старееме, па добивањето доволно каротеноиди во исхраната и локално е од клучно значење за стареењето.<br/><br/>Каротеноидите можат да ги подобрат знаците на фотостареење, промена на бојата на кожата, еластичност, хидратација, текстура и може да ја намалат трансепидермалната загуба на вода.<br/><br/>Астаксантинот особено ги стимулира фибробластите да произведуваат колаген и еластин, ја инхибира активноста на ензимите кои го разложуваат колагенот и еластинот и покажуваат антиинфламаторни и УВ-филтрирачки ефекти. Докажано е дека го намалува меланинот во кожата, што резултира со намалување на појавата на пеги и мелазма.<br/><br/>Анти-акни активност: анти-воспалителната активност на каротеноидите помага да се намалат воспалението и иритацијата поврзани со акни. Каротеноидите, исто така, помагаат да се нормализираат и балансираат масните секрети од лојните жлезди. Тие се вредни агенти во поправката на кожата и ја стимулираат епидермалната регенерација, помагајќи ја кожата да биде мазна и омекната.<br/><br/>Каде можам да најдам каротеноиди?<br/><br/>Постојат два начина да се добие вашата дневна доза на каротеноиди: преку исхрана и преку локална апликација. Комбинацијата на двете е идеален пристап кон добро стареење на кожата.<br/><br/>Каротеноидите се растворливи во масти, па на вашето тело му треба маснотии за да ги апсорбира (мислете на домати и маслиново масло, брокула и путер, или спанаќ и авокадо). Вообичаени извори на каротеноиди во храната се авокадо, жолчки од јајца, кале, спанаќ, моркови, слатки компири, папаја и домати.<br/><br/>Додека ние се залагаме за добивање на колку што е можно повеќе хранливи материи и антиоксиданти од храната, наместо дополнување, една студија покажа дека астаксантин во комбинација со колаген хидролизат значително го подобрува интегритетот на бариерата, ја намалува трансепидермалната загуба на вода и ја зголемува експресијата на проколаген тип I mRNA.<br/><br/>Актуелната примена е клучна за здрава кожа. Истражувањата покажуваат дека високите концентрации на антиоксиданси во човечката кожа ја нудат најдобрата заштита за здрава кожа на која било возраст.<br/><br/>Во Сарка Ботаникалс, ние ги мешаме каротеноидите богати, цели растенија како што се невен, глуварче и екстракти како астаксантин со ладно притиснати масла и функционални состојки. Само невен содржи повеќе од 19 различни видови на каротеноиди. Ова може да објасни зошто има толку долга историја на употреба во нега на кожата. Студиите покажуваат дека каротеноидите измешани со коензим Q10 се особено ефективни во намалувањето на воспалението и забавувањето на предвременото стареење на кожата поради изложеност на сонце. |
