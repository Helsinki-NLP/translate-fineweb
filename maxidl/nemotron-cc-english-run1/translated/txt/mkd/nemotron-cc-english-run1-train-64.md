| Smith Chuck - Through the Bible C2000 SeriesShall we turn to the book of Acts, chapter one, as we begin our study of the early church.<br/>Luke, the author of the book of Acts, a companion of Paul the apostle, who was author also of the Gospel According to Luke, wrote these two treatises to a friend, Theophilus. Theophilus is a Greek name. It's a name that has a beautiful meaning. The name means lover of God. There are some who believe that it was not a man at all, but that the gospel and the book of Acts were addressed to the lovers of God, whoever you may be. There are other traditions that say that Theophilus was actually Luke's master. That in those days physicians were slaves, usually the slave of a wealthy patron. So that Luke's master was Theophilus, and he released Luke to be with Paul on the missionary journeys. Thus, Luke is writing back to his former master. This is an early tradition of the church, but it is, of course, impossible to prove, like so many of the traditions.<br/>There are also those who believe that when Paul was in Troas and he received a vision of a man calling unto him saying, "Come over to Macedonia and help us," that that man in Paul's vision was none other than Luke. For the first one that Paul really met when he came to Macedonia was Luke. And as we are in the book of Acts, you will find that when we get to that portion of the book of Acts, Luke begins to write more in the first person rather than the third person. So it is, evidently, at this particular point in the Acts of the Apostles that Luke became a companion of Paul and began to journey with him. He began to use the pronouns "we" and "us" instead of "they" and "them." This is, no doubt, where Luke became a participant and an eyewitness of those things that were happening from this point on. We will bring this out to you when we get to that point.<br/>He begins the Acts of the Apostles by tying it with the Gospel According to Luke. It is interesting that the very last thing that Luke records in his gospel is the very first thing he records in the Acts of the Apostles. We find the gospel of Luke closing as Jesus is telling His disciples to wait in Jerusalem until they be endued with power from on high. And then Jesus ascended up into heaven, and so he closes the gospel. In opening the Acts of the Apostles, he writes,<br/>The former treatise [that is, the Gospel According to Luke,] have I written unto you, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and teach ( Act 1:1 ),<br/>The key word is began. The Gospel According to Luke is not the full story of the ministry of Jesus Christ. It is only the beginning of the ministry of Jesus Christ. Jesus continues to minister to the needs of people. Jesus continues to heal the sick. Jesus continues to raise the dead. Jesus continues to minister His love and His gospel to the world, only now He is ministering through those disciples who have been anointed with His Holy Spirit. But the ministry of Christ is continuing; basically, is the premise that Luke takes in the Acts of the Apostles. The former treatise of all that Jesus began, both to do and to teach.<br/>Now because of that, the Acts of the Apostles is an unfinished book: in that the Lord today continues to work through the lives of those who have dedicated themselves to be the instruments of God. To be led and guided and anointed by His Holy Spirit, to continue the ministry of Jesus in the world today. Now God has ordained that His work should be accomplished through human instruments. I do not say that it must be accomplished. God can use angelic beings for His work, and there will come a time, during the book of Revelation when God will use angels to proclaim His gospel to people all over the world. Revelation, chapter 14, "The first angel flying through the midst of heaven having the everlasting gospel" ( Rev 14:6 ). But at the present time, God has chosen to use human instruments. As imperfect as they may be, yet that's what God has ordained to use. The exciting thing about that is, God will use me and God will use you. So many times, we're begging off, "O Lord, I can't speak. I've never been able to speak before or even now, Lord." As Moses tried to beg off the call of God. Jeremiah said, "Lord, I'm just a kid; no one's going to listen to me." And we all have our excuses why we can't be used. Don't we? We all know the reasons why God couldn't use us.<br/>One time, as the Lord was calling a prophet to do His work, he said, "Lord, send whoever you want." The Lord said, "Hey, I've called you." "Lord, good idea; send whoever you want." So often we're in that position, "Lord, send by the hand of whomsoever you will, anybody but me Lord." And yet, God has ordained to use us.<br/>Now, each of us can show our own imperfections. Each of us can point out our own inabilities, and all of us can find an excuse why God wouldn't want to use me. But yet, God has chosen to use you. That through your life He might reveal Himself to a needy world. You wonder when God has such instruments to use how He ever got the job done, don't you?<br/>Until the day in which he was taken up, after that he through the Holy Spirit had given commandments to the apostles whom he had chosen ( Act 1:2 ):<br/>That is what he ended the Gospel of Luke with. The day that Jesus was taken up, after He had told the apostles to wait for the endowment of power.<br/>To whom he also [that is the apostles he also] showed himself alive to them after his passion [or death] by many infallible proofs ( Act 1:3 ),<br/>It is difficult to deny the fact of the resurrection of Jesus Christ. I was amused, as well as annoyed and irritated, by an article I read in the Santa Ana Register this last Saturday. Of the creation science and evolutionary theories being presented in the county schools. How that, this one professor said that he teaches a science class, and thus, they deal only in facts, and that they don't have any place for theories. Because science is based upon fact and creation is based upon religious superstitions. It takes a lot of faith to believe the religious theories. When you are dealing with facts, you can just accept them. I thought, "Very interesting in that science class, they taught me it was a fact that the world was four billion years old. Now today they are teaching it's a fact that the world is twelve billion years old. And it wasn't that long ago that I went to school."<br/>It's interesting that the Bible has never needed to be revised or updated to meet the current data that men have discovered. And yet, if you would take my high school science textbooks today and try to teach a science class from them, you would find that many of the things that were taught as scientific fact when I was in high school are no longer recognized as scientific fact. The simple cell protoplasm is no longer a simple cell, but extremely complex. If there is any fact that can be attested to in history it is the fact of the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.<br/>We have a jurisprudence system that is based upon the testimony of witnesses. If a man is accused of a crime and there are people who witnessed that crime while it was being committed, and they are brought to the standard, and they swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help them God. And in their questioning they affirm that, "I saw that man in the bank on May twenty-third. I saw him pull out a gun from his coat. I heard him demand that all of the money be given to him. I saw him as he left the bank. I saw him as the officer apprehended him outside." And if you can get three or four witnesses to point to that man and will keep their testimony under cross-examination, that man is judged to be guilty. He is the one who did it. We have two or three witnesses that are testifying the same story about that man, and it is accepted as fact that he is the one who perpetrated the crime and is guilty. You've got witnesses who have sworn to tell the truth that are verifying.<br/>After the death of Jesus, when He rose again, He appeared unto many different people who gave sworn testimony that they saw Him. That they talked to Him, that He appeared to them in various places under different circumstances. And for a period of forty days was visiting with them. And at one time, up to as many as five hundred people who were gathered at one place, He appeared. It's difficult to just cast aside or deny the witness of these people. To do so is to discredit our whole jurisprudence system. But not only that, these men who testified that they saw the risen Lord, that they talked to Him, that they ate with Him, they, all of them, with the exception of one, met violent deaths at the hands of other people because of their affirming that the story they told was true. You talk about witnesses sworn to tell the truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth. If a person's life was threatened because of that witness, and it was a lie, at least one them would've broken under the pressure. They would've confessed to the entire hoax. "He showed Himself alive after His passion by many infallible proofs."<br/>being seen of them for forty days, speaking to them of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God ( Act 1:3 ):<br/>Sometimes we fault the disciples because of their questions of the timing of the kingdom of God. Let it be remembered that the kingdom of God was the favorite subject of Jesus Christ. He was always talking about the kingdom of God, and it is a great hope that He was planting into the hearts of all men. Things are not always going to continue corrupted as they are. The world is not going to go forever under the power of darkness, under the bondage of evil. God is going to one day establish His kingdom upon the earth. A kingdom of righteous joy and peace. "Jesus shall reign, where ere the sun doth her successive journeys run. And His kingdom will extend from shore to shore." And that day will be the most glorious day the world has ever seen, as sickness and suffering and pain will be abolished in His kingdom. As sin and greed and these things that have made the world such an intolerable place will be abolished in His kingdom. The godless commercialism, the exploitation of man, all of these things abolished in His glorious kingdom when He reigns. No wonder the disciples were anxious to get it on. I'm anxious to get it on; I'm anxious for His kingdom to come. And Jesus told us when we pray, the first petition is, "Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven" ( Mat 6:10 ). This is the right kind of a desire that we should all have. I desire the kingdom of God. And so He was talking to them, during this forty-day period, of the kingdom.<br/>And, being assembled together with them, he commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which, saith he, you have heard of me ( Act 1:4 ).<br/>He said, "Now look, wait here in Jerusalem until you receive the promise of the Father." This promise that He is referring to is, no doubt, the promise in Joel where the Lord promised, "And it shall come to pass in the later days, saith the Lord, that I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and daughters will prophesy, and your young men shall dream dreams, your old men shall see visions: and upon my servants and my handmaidens shall I pour out my Spirit, saith the Lord" ( Joe 2:28-29 ). The promise of the Father: the day is going to come when God is going to pour out His Spirit upon all flesh, all of the believers. They will, each one, receive that dynamic from God.<br/>For John [He said,] truly baptized with water; but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now ( Act 1:5 ).<br/>The idea of baptism was that of emersion, the bapteedzo. John baptized with water, submerged the people in water, "you're going to be submerged in the Holy Spirit in not many days."<br/>Now when they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, will you at this time restore the kingdom to Israel? ( Act 1:6 )<br/>"When is it going to be, Lord? When's the time for this restoration?" And Jesus is talking to them now, not about the kingdom, but about the power that they're going to receive for service. And so He brushes aside their question.<br/>Saying unto them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father has put in his own power ( Act 1:7 ).<br/>"It's not for you to know." They lived constantly in the anticipation of the immediate setting up of the kingdom. During the entire lifetime of Jesus, they were expecting Him at any moment to go into the phone booth and come out as the savior of the world. Shazzam! Showing His power and overthrowing the governments of the world, establishing God's kingdom upon the earth. And they were waiting daily for this change to transpire. And whenever Jesus would talk about going to Jerusalem, being turned over into the hands of sinful man, and then being crucified, "Oh, oh no, Lord. No, no you don't understand the kingdom, Lord. Be that far from Thee." When Jesus died on the cross, they were all greatly disappointed.<br/>The two disciples on the road to Emmaus, so sad. "Hey, fellows. How come you're so sad as your walking along?" "What do you mean? You must be a stranger around here if you don't know the things that have been happening lately in Jerusalem." "What things?" "Oh, a fellow by the name of Jesus of Nazareth...oh man, it was mighty and powerful. The anointing of God was upon His life. We had hoped that in Him was the deliverance of Israel, but they crucified Him. We had hoped . . . now it's dead." Now He's risen, and He's saying, "In a few days, fellows, you're going to receive the promise of the Father." "Oh, what promise? The promise of the establishing of the kingdom?" You see, it was legitimate that they should ask. "Is this it Lord? Alright! Is this the time? Are you going to set up your kingdom now?" "No. It's not for you to know those times that the Father's appointed or that the Father has in His own power. But, you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you."<br/>Now here, the Greek preposition epi is used to signify a new relationship that they were to have with the Holy Spirit. In the Gospel According to John, chapter 14, as Jesus is there promising to send the Holy Spirit, He said, "I will not leave you comfortless. I will come to you, and I will pray the Father, and He will send to you another comforter, even the Spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth Him not neither knows Him, but you know Him for He dwells with you, and He shall be in you" ( Joh 14:17-18 ). Same Greek preposition as ours, only they spell it "en" instead of "in." Two-fold relationship there in John: He is with you, but He's going to be dwelling in you. But now Jesus said you're going to receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you. The Greek preposition epi, which is translated in different texts throughout the New Testament as "upon" or "over" or I like it, "overflows."<br/>In the seventh chapter of the gospel of John: "On the last day, the great day of the feast when Jesus stood there on the Temple Mount and cried to the people, 'If any man thirst let him come unto Me and drink: and he who drinks of the water that I give, out of his innermost being there will gush torrents of living water.'" John said, "This spake He of the Spirit, which was not yet given which they who believe on Him should receive" ( Joh 7:37-39 ). What did He speak of the Spirit? That it would be like a torrent of living water flowing out. I like, "When the Spirit overflows you," upon you, or over you, or overflows from you. So the three-fold relationship: He is with you prior to your conversion, He is the one who causes you to realize that you are a sinner, He is the one who points to Jesus Christ as the answer as He convinces the world of sin, of righteous, and of judgment. The moment you open your life and heart to Jesus Christ and invite Him to come in, the Holy Spirit comes and begins to indwell you. He shall be in you. "Know ye not that you are not your own, you have been bought with a price, therefore glorify God in your body and your spirit which are His. And know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit which is in you? Be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess, but be filled, or be ye being filled with the Spirit" ( 1Co 6:19-20 ,Eph 5:18 ). But now here's a third relationship. This is an empowering experience.<br/>You will receive [the dunamus] the dynamics, when the Holy Spirit has come [epi] upon you [or over you, or when there is that overflow from you]: and ye shall be witnesses unto me ( Act 1:8 )<br/>And so the dynamic, to be a witness for Jesus Christ. It is interesting that the word witness in Greek is the word martus from where we get our word martyr. And in Greek it does mean martyr. A witness is one who not only proclaims what he believes, he lives what he believes, he is what he believes, and he believes it so strongly, that if necessary, he'll die for what he believes. That's how strong is his belief. He's a martus. You can't stop him. He's not afraid to die for what he believes.<br/>You remember when Paul was on his way back to Jerusalem and Agabus came down from Caesarea and he took Paul's girdle and tied himself up and he said, "So is the man who owns this girdle to be bound when he gets to Jerusalem." And Paul's friends began to weep, saying, "Oh, Paul, don't go, don't go." And he said, "What do you mean by these tears? Do you think you're going to dissuade me? Do you think I'm worried about being bound? I'm ready to die." He was a martus. "I'm ready to die." Being put to death for your faith did not make you a martyr; because you were a martyr, you were put to death. Because you were a witness, because you believed it so strong. So, it did not make you a witness, it only proved what you were. You were a witness all along. If you hadn't been a martus, you would've never gone to your death. You would've recanted; you would've said, "Whoa, whoa, wait, wait. Hold on, let's change course here. I think that I may have made a mistake." Then you say, "Well, he wasn't a martus. Stealing a horse doesn't make you a horse thief; it only proves that you were. No one steals a horse unless he's a horse thief. So, stealing it doesn't make you a horse thief, it only proves that you were all along. Being martyred only proves what you were a witness, a martus. "And you will be witnesses." And isn't it interesting that most of them were martyred? "Witnesses unto Me."<br/>The witness was to be both in Jerusalem, and in all of Judea ( Act 1:8 ),<br/>The witness began right at home. The hardest place, isn't it? It's to start right at home in Jerusalem, and then the area around Jerusalem, the area of Judea. And then it was to spread up into Samaria. And then it was to go out into the uttermost parts of the world. And as we study the book of Acts, we will see this very progression. How the witness began in Jerusalem. We'll get that in the next chapter. And then we'll see how it began to spread through out Judea. And then Phillip went up into Samaria, and then finally Paul and Barnabas are called to go into the uttermost parts of the world. And so the witness spread through the anointing and the empowering of the Holy Spirit.<br/>Now when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight ( Act 1:9 ).<br/>This is the final promise made by Jesus to His disciples. This is it, the final words prior to His ascension. Of course, later He came and talked to Paul and others, but prior to His ascension, this is His final word. And upon this, when He had spoken these things, while they were watching Him, He was taken up and a cloud received Him out of their sight.<br/>And while they were looking steadfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, there were two men who stood by them in white apparel ( Act 1:10 );<br/>We assume they were angels.<br/>Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as you have seen him go into heaven ( Act 1:11 ).<br/>They saw Him as He ascended up into heaven and they will behold Him when He comes again. "Behold the Lord cometh with ten thousands of His saints, to execute judgement upon the earth" (Jud 1:14-15). And then, "Unto Him who loved us and gave Himself for us and who has made us unto our God, kings and priests who shall reign with Him upon the earth, behold the Lord cometh, and every eye shall see Him, and they also who pierced Him shall mourn" Rev 1:5-7 ). So the Lord's coming. Every eye shall see Him. The Jehovah Witnesses say that He is already come, but it was a secret coming. As it was only the disciples that saw Him go, it was only the disciples, of the Jehovah Witnesses, who saw Him return. But Jesus said, "If they say unto you, 'He has come in secret and has gone into a secret chamber don't believe it'" ( Mat 24:26 ). So you have to choose, to believe Jesus or them.<br/>"This same Jesus which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as you've seen Him go into heaven."<br/>Now there's a very interesting verse in II John, verse Act 1:7 , "For many deceivers are entered into the world who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh." That, unfortunately, is a poor translation of the Greek. For this participle is in the present tense and should be translated "is coming in the flesh." Those who would deny that Jesus Christ is coming in the flesh. What does John say of them? "They are a deceiver and an antichrist. Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward. For whosoever transgresses and abides not in the doctrine of Christ, has not God. He that abides in the doctrine of Christ, he has both the Father and the Son. And if there come any unto your door (on Saturday morning) and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, and neither bid him good-bye. For he that bids him good-bye is a partaker of his evil deeds" (2Jn 1:7-11). Ask them one question, "Is Jesus coming in the flesh?" Just ask them that question. And if they say no, just remember what John warned you and what John told you. "If any confess not that Jesus Christ is coming in the flesh." Do you remember when He was with the disciples and He said, "Give me something to eat"? He said, "You know, spirits don't eat; touch me. See? It's me." So, this same Jesus is coming again in the same manner in which they saw Him go into heaven. And I, for one, believe that that coming is very soon.<br/>Then retuned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a Sabbath's day journey [about two-thirds of a mile]. And when they were come in, they went up into an upper room, where there abode both Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, and Phillip, and Thomas, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon Zelotes, and Judas the brother of James. And these all continued in one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers ( Act 1:12-14 ).<br/>This is the last mention of Mary the mother of Jesus. At this point and from this point on, there is no further mention of her in the Acts of the Apostles or in the epistles. No mention of her death or of her miraculous ascension into heaven, without death. Nothing is mentioned in the scripture. It is silent.<br/>His brethren would be a reference probably to James and to Jude and to those other brothers who were sons of Joseph and Mary.<br/>The upper room--there are some who say that it is the same upper room in which Jesus had the Last Supper with His disciples. And yet, there are others who hold to this upper room being a room in the temple precincts where the early church met. Take your choice.<br/>And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples, and said, (the number of their names together were about one hundred and twenty,) men and brethren, this Scripture must needs have been fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit by the mouth of David spake before concerning Judas, which was a guide to those who took Jesus ( Act 1:15-16 ).<br/>Here again, Peter still his same impetuous self. They're waiting in prayer and supplication, and Peter stands up and says, "Fellows, there's a scripture that's gotta be fulfilled." And you know he's going to move ahead, "Let's get the program going; let's cast lots and find out who's going to take Judas' place." I do feel that Peter was again in the flesh, manifesting that impetuous nature that was his. And I think that the future history of the church in the book of Acts points this out. I am interested in Peter's understanding of the scriptures, how that he is quoting from so many places in the Old Testament. Peter does manifest a very great understanding of the Old Testament scriptures which is a point in his favor.<br/>Notice that Peter ascribes to the Holy Spirit those things that David wrote. So that, "All scripture is given by inspiration of God" ( 2Ti 3:16 ). Not part of the scriptures. Because, if you tell me that part of the scriptures are given by inspiration of God, then I must ask you, "What parts are by inspiration and what parts are not by inspiration?" And then you are then the authority who tells me what part I can believe and what part I can't believe. And the minute that God is no longer the authority but you're the authority, I'm in trouble. Beware of those who say, "Well, you can't believe all of the scriptures." The scriptures themselves say, "All scripture is given by inspiration of God." And here, Luke in writing of what Peter was saying, declares that David was actually the spokesman for the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit, by the mouth of David, spake concerning Judas.<br/>For he was numbered with us, [he was one of the twelve] he had obtained a part of this ministry. But now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity; and falling headlong ( Act 1:17-18 ),<br/>He purchased the field, the potter's field as Zachariah the eleventh chapter declares.<br/>and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all of his bowels gushed out ( Act 1:18 ).<br/>There are those who find a discrepancy in the scriptures, because in one of the gospels we are told that when Judas came back and tried to return the money, and they said, "Hey, it's your problem. We can't take it." And put it back in the temple treasury. "It's blood money." Then he threw it there on the floor of the temple and he went out and hung himself. Here Peter tells us that he fell headlong and just popped. And there are those who imagine a discrepancy. Very simple, he went up into the tree to hang himself, tied the rope around his neck and tied it to the limb and jumped. And the force of the fall either snapped the rope or his head, and he fell on down into the canyon and just as he said it here.<br/>It was known to all of the dwellers at Jerusalem; insomuch that the field is called in their tongue, Aceldama, that is to say, The field of blood. For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be desolate, and let no man dwell therein: and, His bishoprick let another take ( Act 1:19-20 ).<br/>Now in reality he's quoting from two different Psalms here. From Psa 69:25 ,he puts it together with Psa 109:8 . And putting the two together he finds these prophecies concerning Judas.<br/>Wherefore of these men ( Act 1:21 )<br/>Now here is where they are looking for someone to take Judas' place to be an apostle. Here are the qualifications they looked for in that time.<br/>Wherefore of these men which have companied with us all the time that the Lord Jesus when in and out among us ( Act 1:21 ),<br/>Now you remember there were many disciples, many disciples of which Jesus chose ten to be apostles. And the word apostle means "one who is sent out." Or chose twelve to be apostles, so He sent out the twelve. The number of human government. "We only have eleven. We need one to take Judas' place, but we need one who has been with us all the while from the beginning with Jesus."<br/>From the time he was baptized by John, until the day he was taken up from us, must one be ordained to be a witness [of what?] of His resurrection ( Act 1:22 ).<br/>So these were the requirements they were looking for. Someone who had been around the whole while. From the time of John's baptism to the ascension. And one who saw the risen Lord, and thus could bear fact of the resurrection, their testimony to the fact.<br/>Now Paul the apostle, later in asserting the fact that he was an apostle said, "Have I not seen the risen Christ?" Evidently that was one of the requirements of apostleship. Someone asked me, "Are there apostles today?" Well, I don't know. I don't think that there are in the same sense that they were in the New Testament. Surely there is none today who can bear witness to the resurrection as they did.<br/>They appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias. And they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord, which knowest the hearts of all men, show whether of these two that you have chosen ( Act 1:23-24 ),<br/>I think that we often make this mistake of giving the Lord two choices, both wrong. Limiting God, you see. We're so prone to do this. Obviously, Paul was God's choice. Peter was impetuous, and jumping the gun said, "Hey, we've got to do something, you know, gotta help God out. You know, one's missing and we've got to fill him in." And yet, "God, which one of these two do you want?" And giving God the two choices.<br/>That he may take part of this ministry and this apostleship, from which Judas by the transgression fell, that he might go to his own place. And so they gave forth their lots ( Act 1:25-26 );<br/>An interesting way by which they sought to determine the will of God. Let's throw dice, find out what God's will is here. It's interesting to me, the various ways that people have devised to discern the will of God. Now, in the Old Testament times they had an interesting way of coming to the priest, who would inquire of the Lord for them through the Urim and the Thummim, the "lights and perfections." Just what these Urim and Thummim were, we don't know. I'm sure they were not the colored glasses that Joseph Smith found with the Golden Tablets; the magic glasses, that when you put them on, you could suddenly read the hieroglyphic writing.<br/>There are those who say that the Urim and Thummim were actually a black and a white stone that was worn in a pouch on the chest of the priest. They would pray and ask the Lord a particular question. You remember that David was asking the Lord definite questions: "Lord, shall we go out against the Philistines?" The answer was, "No." So again, the next day, "Lord, shall we go out against the Philistines?" The answer was, "Yes." "When shall we go?" They would ask specific questions, and the Lord would direct them through the Urim and the Thummin. They say that the priest would pray, seek God, and then reach in and pull out one of the two stones. If it was the white stone, it was a yes answer. If it was a no, then it would be the black stone that he would pull out. Some even say we get the term blackballed from this Urim and Thummim. Actually, back in the original it is a no vote against a particular project or idea. Just what the Urim and Thummim were, we don't know. But during the Old Testament period, they did use a method of casting lots to determine the will of God.<br/>So here the disciples are picking up on the same thing as they are throwing the dice to see which of the two fellows that God had chosen to replace Judas Iscariot.<br/>the lot fell on Matthias; he was numbered with the eleven ( Act 1:26 ).<br/>Now who in the world is Matthias? No one ever heard of him before or since. It'll be interesting to meet Matthias and find out who he is and what he did. I think from the subsequent history, it's obvious to assume that God chose Paul as an apostle. Paul declares it himself. Now this is the last time we ever read of them seeking to discern the will of God by the casting of lots or by a chance kind of a thing.<br/>I know a fellow today, in seeking to discern the will of the Lord, will pray and ask the Lord a question. He'll have ten pennies in his pocket, and as he's praying, he'll take the pennies with his eyes closed and put them down on the table, and if they all come up heads, it's a yes. An interesting thing, every once in a while, they'll all come up heads, and that's pretty good odds. Yet, we don't find any pattern for this after the Holy Spirit was given. Once the Holy Spirit came upon the church, then the Holy Spirit began to speak to them and direct them. And the Holy Spirit said, "Separate unto me Paul and Barnabas for the ministry where I have called them" ( Act 13:2 ). And the Holy Spirit sent them forth. So we find the church more directly guided by the Holy Spirit. Once the Holy Spirit came, this throwing dice to find out the will of God was set aside.<br/>"<br/><br/>King James Version<br/><br/>This is the 1769 King James Version of the Holy Bible (also known as the Authorized Version). "Public Domain" | Смит Чак - Преку библиската C2000 серијаЌе се свртиме кон книгата Дела, поглавје 1, како што почнуваме нашето проучување на раната црква.<br/>Лука, авторот на книгата Дела, придружник на Павле апостол, кој беше автор и на Евангелието Според Лука, напиша овие две трактати на еден пријател, Теофил. Теофил е грчко име. Тоа е име кое има убаво значење. Името значи љубител на Бога. Има некои кои веруваат дека тоа не беше човек на сите, но дека Евангелието и книгата Дела се наменети за љубителите на Бога, кој и да сте. Има и други традиции кои велат дека Теофил всушност бил господар на Лука. Дека во тие денови лекарите биле робови, обично роб на богат покровител. Така што господарот на Лука беше Теофил, и тој го пушти Лука да биде со Павле на мисионерските патувања. Така, Лука му пишува назад на својот поранешен господар. Ова е рана традиција на Црквата, но, се разбира, тоа е невозможно да се докаже, како и многу од традициите.<br/>Има и такви кои веруваат дека, кога Павле беше во Троада и имаше видение на еден човек кој го викаше, велејќи: „Дојди во Македонија и помогни ни“, дека тој човек во видението на Павле не беше никој друг, туку Лука. Бидејќи првиот со кој Павле навистина се сретнал кога дошол во Македонија бил Лука. И бидејќи сме во книгата Дела, ќе најдете дека кога ќе стигнеме до тој дел од книгата Дела, Лука почнува да пишува повеќе во првото лице отколку во третото лице. Значи, тоа е, очигледно, во овој конкретен момент во Дела на апостолите дека Лука стана придружник на Павле и почна да патува со него. Тој почна да се користи заменките "ние" и "ние" наместо "тие" и "тие". Ова е, без сомнение, каде што Лука стана учесник и очевидец на оние работи што се случуваат од овој момент натаму. Ние ќе го изнесеме ова до вас кога ќе стигнеме до таа точка.<br/>Тој ги започнува Дела на апостолите со поврзување со Евангелието според Лука. Интересно е дека последното нешто што Лука го запишува во своето евангелие е првото нешто што го запишува во Дела на апостолите. Го наоѓаме евангелието на Лука завршува како Исус им кажува на своите ученици да чекаат во Ерусалим додека тие не бидат облечени со сила одозгора. И тогаш Исус се вознесе на небото, и така тој го затвора Евангелието. Во отворањето на Дела на апостолите, тој пишува,<br/>Поранешниот трактат ти го напишав, Теофиле, за сè што Исус почна да прави и да поучува (Дела 1:1).<br/>Клучниот збор е започнат. Евангелието Според Лука не е целосна приказна за службата на Исус Христос. Тоа е само почеток на службата на Исус Христос. Исус продолжува да служи на потребите на луѓето. Исус продолжува да лекува болни. Исус продолжува да ги воскреснува мртвите. Исус продолжува да му служи на Неговата љубов и Неговото евангелие на светот, само сега Тој служи преку оние ученици кои се помазани со Неговиот Свет Дух. Но, службата на Христос продолжува; во основа, е премисата дека Лука зема во Дела на апостолите. Поранешниот трактат на сè што Исус почна, и да се направи и да поучува.<br/>Затоа Дела апостолски се недовршена книга: во тоа Господ и денес продолжува да дејствува низ животот на оние кои се посветиле да бидат Божји орудија. Да се води и да се води и помазани од страна на Неговиот Свет Дух, да продолжи со службата на Исус во светот денес. Сега Бог има наредено дека Неговата работа треба да се изврши преку човечки инструменти. Јас не велам дека тоа мора да се постигне. Бог може да користи ангелски суштества за Своето дело, и ќе дојде време, за време на книгата Откровение, кога Бог ќе користи ангели за да го објавува Своето евангелие на луѓето низ целиот свет. Откровение, поглавје 14, "Првиот ангел лета низ средината на небото, имајќи вечно Евангелие" ( Откровение 14:6). Но, во сегашноста, Бог избра да се користи човечки инструменти. Како несовршени како што може да биде, сепак тоа е она што Бог е наредено да се користи. Возбудливото нешто во врска со тоа е, Бог ќе ме користи и Бог ќе те користи. Толку многу пати, ние се молат надвор, "Господи, јас не можам да зборувам. Јас никогаш не сум бил во можност да зборувам пред или дури и сега, Господи." Како Мојсеј се обиде да се моли надвор од повикот на Бога. Еремија рече: „Господи, јас сум само дете; никој нема да ме слуша.“ И сите имаме изговори зошто не можеме да бидеме искористени. Зарем не? Сите ги знаеме причините зошто Бог не може да не искористи.<br/>Еднаш, кога Господ повика пророк да го изврши Своето дело, рече: „Господи, испрати кого сакаш.“ А Господ рече: „Еј, Те повикав.“ „Господи, добра идеја, испрати кого сакаш.“ Толку често се наоѓаме во таа положба, "Господи, испрати преку раката на кого сакаш, некој освен мене Господ." А сепак, Бог е наредил да не користи.<br/>Сега, секој од нас може да се покаже нашите сопствени несовршености. Секој од нас може да се укаже на нашите сопствени неспособности, и сите од нас може да се најде изговор зошто Бог не би сакал да ме користи. Но, сепак, Бог избра да те користи. Дека преку вашиот живот Тој би можел да се открие на сиромашниот свет. Се прашувате кога Бог има такви инструменти за користење како Тој некогаш ја завршил работата, нели?<br/>До денот кога беше вознесен, откако преку Светиот Дух им даде заповеди на апостолите, кои ги избра (Дела 1:2):<br/>Тоа е она што го заврши Евангелието на Лука со. Денот кога Исус беше земен, откако Тој им рече на апостолите да чекаат за дарот на моќ.<br/>3Испрати и друг; и него го убија; и мнозина други, или натепаа, или, пак, ги убија.<br/>Тешко е да се негира фактот на воскресението на Исус Христос. Бев забавен, како и вознемирен и вознемирен, со статија што ја прочитав во Санта Ана регистар оваа минатата сабота. За науката за создавањето и еволутивните теории кои се презентирани во училиштата во округот. Како тоа, овој професор рече дека тој предава научна класа, и така, тие се занимаваат само со факти, и дека немаат место за теории. Бидејќи науката се заснова на факти и создавањето се заснова на религиозни суеверија. Потребно е многу вера за да се верува во религиозните теории. Кога се занимавате со факти, можете само да ги прифатите. Мислев, "Многу интересно во таа научна класа, ме научија дека е факт дека светот е стар четири милијарди години. Денес тие учат дека е факт дека светот е стар дванаесет милијарди години. И не беше толку одамна кога отидов на училиште.<br/>Интересно е дека Библијата никогаш не треба да се ревидира или ажурира за да ги задоволи тековните податоци што ги откриле луѓето. А сепак, ако ги земете моите учебници за наука во средно училиште денес и се обидете да ги научите на часови по наука од нив, ќе откриете дека многу од работите кои беа предавани како научен факт кога бев во средно училиште повеќе не се препознаени како научен факт. Едноставната клеточна протоплазма повеќе не е едноставна клетка, туку исклучително сложена. Ако постои некој факт што може да се потврди во историјата, тоа е фактот на воскресението на Исус Христос од мртвите.<br/>Имаме систем на судска пракса кој се заснова на сведочење на сведоци. Ако некој е обвинет за злосторство и има луѓе кои биле сведоци на тоа злосторство додека било извршено, и тие се доведени до стандардот, и тие се колнат дека ќе ја кажат вистината, целата вистина и ништо друго освен вистината, па Бог да им помогне. И во нивното испрашување тие тврдат дека: "Го видов човекот во банката на дваесет и трети мај. Го видов како извади пиштол од палтото. Го слушнав како бара да му се дадат сите пари. Го видов кога излегуваше од банката. Јас го видов како офицерот го уапси надвор. "И ако можете да добиете три или четири сведоци да укажат на тој човек и ќе го чуваат своето сведоштво под вкрстено испитување, дека човекот е прогласен за виновен. Тој е оној кој го направи тоа. Имаме двајца или тројца сведоци кои сведочат за истата приказна за тој човек, и се прифаќа како факт дека тој е оној кој го извршил злосторството и дека е виновен.<br/>По смртта на Исуса, кога Тој воскресна, се јави на многу различни луѓе, кои сведочеа со заклетва дека го виделе. Дека тие зборувале со него, дека тој им се јави на различни места под различни околности. И за период од четириесет дена беше во посета со нив. И во едно време, до петстотини луѓе, кои беа собрани на едно место, се појави. Тоа е тешко само да се отфрли или да се одрече сведоштвото на овие луѓе. Да се направи тоа е да се дискредитира целиот наш правен систем. Но, не само тоа, овие луѓе кои сведочеа дека го виделе воскреснатиот Господ, дека разговарале со Него, дека јаделе со Него, тие, сите, со исклучок на еден, се соочиле со насилна смрт од рацете на други луѓе, бидејќи тие тврдат дека приказната што ја раскажале е вистина. Зборуваш за сведоци кои се заколнале дека ќе ја кажат вистината, целата вистина, ништо освен вистината. Ако нечиј живот беше загрозен поради тој сведок, а тоа беше лага, барем еден од нив ќе се скрши под притисок. Тие би ја признале целата измама. "Тој се покажа жив по својата страст со многу непогрешливи докази."<br/>Четириесет дена го гледаа и му зборуваа за царството Божјо (Дела 1:3).<br/>Понекогаш ги обвинуваме учениците поради нивните прашања за времето на Божјото царство. Нека се запамети дека Божјото царство било омилена тема на Исус Христос. Тој секогаш зборуваше за царството Божјо, и тоа е голема надеж дека Тој беше засадување во срцата на сите луѓе. Работите нема секогаш да продолжи расипани како што се. Светот нема да оди засекогаш под власта на темнината, под ропството на злото. Бог еден ден ќе го воспостави Своето царство на земјата. Царство на праведна радост и мир. "Исус ќе царува, каде што сонцето ќе оди на своите последователни патувања. И Неговото царство ќе се протега од брегот до брегот." И тој ден ќе биде најславниот ден што светот некогаш го видел, како што болестите и страдањата и болката ќе бидат укинати во Неговото царство. Како гревот и алчноста и овие работи кои го направиле светот толку неподносливо место ќе бидат укинати во Неговото царство. Безбожниот комерцијализам, експлоатацијата на човекот, сите овие работи се укинати во Неговото славно царство кога Тој владее. Не е ни чудо што учениците биле нестрпливи да го добијат. Јас сум нестрплив да го добијам; Јас сум нестрплив за Неговото царство да дојде. И Исус ни рече кога се молиме, првата молба е: "Да дојде царството твое. Да биде твојата волја на земјата, како што е на небото" (Матеј 6:10). Ова е вистинскиот вид на желбата што сите треба да ја имаме. Го сакам царството Божјо. И така им зборуваше за царството во тој четириесетдневен период.<br/>И кога се собра со нив, им заповеда да не заминуваат од Ерусалим, туку да го чекаат ветувањето на Отецот, за кое, вели, сте чуле за Мене (Дела 1:4).<br/>А Он им рече: „Ете, останете тука, во Ерусалим, додека го примите ветувањето на Отецот.” Ова ветување за кое Тој зборува е, без сомнение, ветувањето во Јоил, каде што Господ ветил: "И во подоцнежните денови, вели Господ, Јас ќе го излеам Мојот Дух врз секое тело; и вашите синови и ќерки ќе пророкуваат, и вашите млади мажи ќе сонуваат соништа, вашите старци ќе гледаат визии; и на Моите слуги и на моите слугинки ќе го излеам Мојот Дух. Ветувањето на Отецот: ќе дојде ден кога Бог ќе го излее Својот Дух врз секое тело, сите верници. Секој ќе ја прими таа динамика од Бога.<br/>Зашто Јован навистина крштаваше со вода; но вие ќе бидете крстени со Светиот Дух не многу денови од сега (Дела 1:5).<br/>Идејата за крштавање беше дека на емерзија, на bapteedzo. Јован крштаваше со вода, потопи луѓето во вода, "ќе се потопи во Светиот Дух во не многу дена."<br/>И кога се собраа, Го прашаа, велејќи: „Господи, ќе го вратиш ли во тоа време царството на Израилот?”<br/>"Кога ќе биде, Господе? Кога е време за оваа обнова?" И Исус сега зборува со нив, не за царството, туку за моќта што тие ќе ја добијат за служба. И така Тој го отстранува нивното прашање.<br/>Им рече: „Не е ваше да ги знаете времињата и времињата, кои Отецот ги поставил во Својата власт“ (Дела 1:7).<br/>"Тоа не е за вас да се знае." Тие живееле постојано во очекување на непосредно поставување на царството. Во текот на целиот живот на Исус, тие се очекува Него во секој момент да одат во телефонската кабина и да излезе како Спасителот на светот. Шазам! Покажувајќи ја Својата моќ и соборувајќи ги владите на светот, воспоставувајќи го Божјото царство на земјата. И тие секојдневно чекаа оваа промена да се случи. И секогаш кога Исус зборуваше за одење во Ерусалим, се предаде во рацете на грешниот човек, а потоа се распнат, "О, о, не, Господе. Не, не, не го разбираш царството, Господе. Биди толку далеку од Тебе." Кога Исус умрел на крстот, сите биле разочарани.<br/>Двајцата ученици на патот кон Емаус, толку тажно. "Еј, момци. Како тоа што сте толку тажни како што одат по?" "Што сакаш да кажеш? Сигурно сте странец тука, ако не знаете што се случува во последно време во Ерусалим." "Што работи?" "О, еден човек по име Исус од Назарет...о човеку, тоа беше моќен и моќен. Божјото помазување беше врз неговиот живот. Се надевавме дека во Него е избавувањето на Израел, но тие Го распнаа. Се надевавме . . . сега е мртов. " Сега Тој воскресна, и вели, "За неколку дена, луѓе, ќе го добиете ветувањето на Отецот." "О, какво ветување? Ветувањето за воспоставување на царството?" Гледате, тоа е оправдано дека тие треба да прашам. "Дали е тоа Господ? Во ред! Дали е време? Дали сега ќе го поставите вашето царство? "Не. Не е за вас да ги знаете времињата што Отецот ги определил или што Таткото има во Својата власт. Но, ќе примите сила кога Светиот Дух ќе слезе врз вас. "<br/>Сега тука, грчкиот предлог епи се користи за да означи нов однос што тие треба да имаат со Светиот Дух. Во Евангелието според Јован, поглавје 14, како што Исус е таму ветувајќи дека ќе го испрати Светиот Дух, Тој рече: "Јас нема да ве оставам без утеха. Ќе дојдам кај вас и ќе го помолам Отецот, и ќе ви испрати друг утешител, Духот на вистината, Кого светот не може да Го прими, зашто не Го гледа, ниту Го познава, но Вие Го познавате, зашто Тој престојува со вас, и Тој ќе биде во вас“ (Јован 14:17-18). Истиот грчки предлог како нашите, само тие го пишуваат "en" наместо "во". Двоен однос таму во Јован: Тој е со вас, но Тој ќе живее во вас. Но, сега Исус рече дека ќе добиете сила кога Светиот Дух ќе дојде врз вас. Грчкиот предлог епи, кој се преведува во различни текстови низ Новиот Завет како „на“ или „преку“, или како што ми се допаѓа, „прелива“.<br/>Во седмото поглавје на Евангелието по Јован: "Во последниот ден, во големиот ден на празникот, кога Исус стоеше таму на Храмовата Гора и викаше на народот, "Ако некој е жеден нека дојде кај Мене и да пие; и оној кој пие од водата што Јас му ја давам, таму ќе течат реки од жива вода. " Јован рече: "Ова зборуваше за Духот, кој се уште не е дадено дека оние кои веруваат во Него треба да се прими" (Јован 7:37-39 ). Што зборуваше за Духот? Тоа ќе биде како поток на жива вода тече надвор. „Кога Духот ќе ве излее над вас, или над вас, или ќе ве излее од вас. Значи тројниот однос: Тој е со вас пред вашето преобраќање, Тој е оној кој ве наведува да сфатите дека сте грешник, Тој е оној кој укажува на Исус Христос како одговор, како што Тој го убедува светот за гревот, праведноста и судот. Во моментот кога ќе го отворите вашиот живот и срце на Исус Христос и да Го поканите да влезе, Светиот Дух доаѓа и почнува да живее во вас. Тој ќе биде во вас. Зар не знаете дека не сте свои, откупени сте со скапа цена; затоа славете Го Бога во своето тело и во својот дух, кои Му припаѓаат; а не знаете ли дека вашето тело е храм на Светиот Дух, кој е во вас? Не опивајте се со вино, во кое има вишок, туку исполнете се, или исполнете се со Духот" (1 Коринтјаните 6:19-20 , Ефесјаните 5:18 ). Но, сега тука е третиот однос. Ова е зајакнување искуство.<br/>Ќе ја примите динамиката, кога Светиот Дух ќе слезе врз вас, и ќе ми бидете сведоци (Дела 1:8).<br/>И така динамика, да биде сведок за Исус Христос. Интересно е дека зборот сведок на грчки е зборот martus од каде што добиваме нашиот збор маченик. И на грчки тоа не значи маченик. Сведок е оној кој не само што го објавува она во што верува, тој го живее она во што верува, тој е она во што верува, и тој верува толку силно, дека ако е потребно, тој ќе умре за она во што верува. Тоа е колку е силна неговата вера. Тој е Мартус. Не се плаши да умре за она во што верува.<br/>Се сеќавате кога Павле се враќаше во Ерусалим и кога Агав слезе од Цезареја, го зеде појасот на Павле, се врза и рече: „Така е со оној, кој го има овој појас, за да биде врзан кога ќе дојде во Ерусалим.” И пријателите на Павле почнаа да плачат, велејќи: „О, Павле, не оди, не оди.“ А тој рече: „Што мислиш со овие солзи? Мислиш ли дека ќе ме одвратиш? Мислиш ли дека се грижам да не бидам врзан? Подготвен сум да умрам.“ Тој беше мартус. „Подготвен сум да умрам.“ Тоа што бевте убиени за вашата вера не ве направи маченик; бидејќи бевте маченик, бевте убиени. Зашто бевте сведок, бидејќи верувавте толку силно. Значи, тоа не те направи сведок, само докажа што си. Ти беше сведок цело време. Ако не беше Мартус, никогаш немаше да отидеш до твојата смрт. Ќе се откажаш; ќе речеше: "Чекај, чекај, чекај. Чекај, ајде да го смениме курсот тука. Мислам дека можеби направив грешка." Потоа велиш, "Па, тој не беше мартус. Крадењето на коњ не те прави крадец на коњи; тоа само докажува дека си бил. Никој не краде коњ освен ако не е крадец на коњи. Значи, крадењето не ве прави крадец на коњи, туку само докажува дека сте биле цело време. Да се биде маченик само докажува дека сте биле сведок, мартус. "И ќе бидете сведоци." И зарем не е интересно дека повеќето од нив беа маченици? "Сведоци за мене."<br/>А сведоштвото требаше да биде и во Ерусалим и во цела Јудеја (Дела 1:8).<br/>Сведокот почна токму од дома. Најтешкото место, нели? Тоа е да се започне токму од дома во Ерусалим, а потоа областа околу Ерусалим, областа на Јудеја. И тогаш тоа беше да се шири во Самарија. И тогаш тоа беше да излезат во најоддалечените делови на светот. И како што ние ја проучуваме книгата Дела, ќе видиме дека токму овој напредок. Како сведоштвото започна во Ерусалим. Ќе го добиеме тоа во следното поглавје. И тогаш ќе видиме како почна да се шири низ Јудеја. Потоа Филип отиде во Самарија, а потоа Павле и Варнава се повикани да одат во најоддалечените краишта на светот. И така сведоштвото се рашири преку помазувањето и силата на Светиот Дух.<br/>А кога го рече тоа, додека тие гледаа, се подигна, и облак Го зеде од нивните очи“ (Дела 1:9).<br/>Ова е последното ветување што Исус им го даде на Своите ученици. Ова е тоа, последните зборови пред Неговото вознесување. Се разбира, подоцна Тој дојде и разговараше со Павле и другите, но пред Неговото вознесување, ова е Неговиот последен збор. И кога го рече тоа, додека тие Го гледаа, се подигна и облак Го зеде од нивните очи.<br/>И додека гледаа кон небото, додека се вознесуваше, ете, двајца мажи стоеја покрај нив во бели облеки;<br/>Претпоставуваме дека биле ангели.<br/>Тој исто така рече: „Луѓе Галилејци, зошто стоите и гледате кон небото? Овој Исус, Кој се вознесе од вас на небото, ќе дојде како што го видовте да оди на небото“ (Дела 1:11).<br/>Тие Го видоа како се вознесува на небото и ќе Го видат кога повторно ќе дојде. "Еве, Господ доаѓа со десетици илјади Свои светии, за да изврши суд на земјата" (Јуд 1:14-15). А Оној, Кој нè возљуби и Се предаде Себеси за нас, и Кој нè направи цареви и свештеници на нашиот Бог, кои ќе царуваат со Него на земјата, ете, доаѓа Господ, и секое око ќе Го види, и оние, кои Го прободоа, ќе тагуваат (Откровение 1:5-7). Значи Господ доаѓа. Секое око ќе Го види. Јеховините сведоци велат дека Тој веќе дојде, но тоа беше тајно доаѓање. Бидејќи само учениците Го видоа како оди, само учениците на Јеховините сведоци Го видоа како се враќа. А Исус им рече: „Ако ви речат: ‚Тој дојде во тајност и влезе во тајна одаја, не верувајте!‘“ (Матеј 24:26).<br/>Тој Исус, Кој се вознесе од вас на небото, ќе дојде како што сте Го виделе да оди на небото.<br/>Сега постои многу интересен стих во 2 Јован, стих Дело 1:7 , "За многу измамници се влезе во светот, кои не признаваат дека Исус Христос дојде во телото." Тоа, за жал, е лош превод на грчкиот. За овој учесник е во сегашното време и треба да се преведе "доаѓа во телото." Оние кои би негирале дека Исус Христос доаѓа во телото. Што вели Јован за нив? "Тие се измамник и антихрист. Внимавајте да не го изгубиме она што сме го направиле, туку да добиеме целосна награда. Зашто, кој престапува и не останува во Христовото учење, нема Бога. Кој останува во Христовото учење, тој ги има и Таткото и Синот. И ако некој дојде до вашата врата (во сабота наутро), а не ја донесе оваа наука, не го примајте во вашиот дом, ниту го поздравувајте. Зашто оној кој му вели збогум е учесник во неговите зли дела" (2Јован 1:7-11). Прашајте ги едно прашање, "Дали Исус доаѓа во тело?" Само прашајте ги тоа прашање. И ако тие велат не, само се сеќавам на она што Јован те предупреди и она што Јован ти кажа. "Ако некој не признае дека Исус Христос доаѓа во тело." Се сеќаваш ли кога беше со учениците и рече: "Дај ми нешто за јадење?" Тој рече: "Знаеш, духовите не јадат; ме допре. Гледаш? Тоа сум јас." Значи, овој ист Исус доаѓа повторно на истиот начин на кој тие го видоа да оди на небото. И јас, за еден, верувам дека доаѓањето е многу брзо.<br/>И тие се вратија во Ерусалим од гората наречена Маслинова, која е од Ерусалим во саботен ден патување. И кога влегоа, се искачија во горната соба, каде седеа двајцата: Петар, Јаков, Јован, Андреј, Филип, Тома, Вартоломеј и Матеј, Јаков Алфеев, Симон Зилот и Јуда, братот Јаковов. И сите тие еднодушно се молеа и молеа, со жените и со Марија, мајката на Исуса, и со браќата Негови (Дела 1:12-14).<br/>Ова е последното спомнување на Марија, мајката на Исус. Во овој момент и од овој момент натаму, нема понатамошно спомнување на неа во Дела на апостолите или во посланијата. Нема спомнување на нејзината смрт или нејзиното чудесно вознесување на небото, без смрт. Ништо не е спомнато во Светото Писмо.<br/>Неговите браќа веројатно се однесуваат на Јаков и Јуда и на другите браќа кои биле синови на Јосиф и Марија.<br/>Горната соба - постојат некои кои велат дека тоа е истата горната соба во која Исус имал Последната вечера со Своите ученици. И сепак, постојат и други кои се држат до оваа горна соба е соба во храмот области каде што раната црква се сретна. Избери.<br/>И во тие денови, Петар застана среде учениците и рече (бројот на нивните имиња беа околу сто и дваесет), мажи и браќа, ова Писмо мора да треба да се исполни, што Светиот Дух зборуваше преку устата на Давида за Јуда, кој беше водич за оние кои го зедоа Исуса (Дела 1:15-16).<br/>Тука повторно, Петар сеуште е истата напната себе. Тие чекаат во молитва и молба, и Петар станува и вели: "Следници, има Писмо што мора да се исполни." И знаете дека тој ќе оди напред, "Ајде да ја започнеме програмата; ајде да фрлиме ждрепка и да дознаеме кој ќе го заземе местото на Јуда." Навистина чувствувам дека Петар беше повторно во телото, манифестирајќи ја таа наметлива природа која му припаѓаше. И мислам дека идната историја на црквата во книгата Дела го покажува ова. Ме интересира Петровото разбирање на Писмата, како тој цитира од толку многу места во Стариот Завет. Петар покажува многу големо разбирање на Старозаветните списи, што е точка во негова корист.<br/>Забележете дека Петар му ги припишува на Светиот Дух оние работи што Давид ги напишал. Така, "Целото Писмо е дадено преку инспирација од Бога" (2 Тимотеј 3:16). Не е дел од Писмото. Бидејќи, ако ми кажете дека дел од Светото Писмо е даден со инспирација од Бог, тогаш морам да ве прашам: „Кои делови се со инспирација, а кои не се со инспирација?“ И тогаш ти си авторитетот кој ми кажува во кој дел можам да верувам, а во кој не можам да верувам. И во моментот кога Бог повеќе не е авторитет, туку ти си авторитетот, јас сум во неволја. Чувајте се од оние, кои велат: „Не можете да им верувате на сите Писма!“ И самите Писма велат: „Целото Писмо е од Бога вдахновено.“ И тука, Лука пишувајќи за она што Петар го рече, вели дека Давид е всушност гласник на Светиот Дух. Светиот Дух, преку устата на Давид, зборуваше за Јуда.<br/>Зашто тој беше изброен со нас, [тој беше еден од дванаесетте] тој доби дел од оваа служба. Но, сега овој човек купи нива со награда за беззаконие; и падна со глава (Дела 1:17-18),<br/>Тој го купил полето, грнчарското поле, како што вели Захарија во единаесеттото поглавје.<br/>И падна на глава, и се расцепи во средината, и сите негови црева излегоа (Дела 1:18).<br/>Има некои кои наоѓаат несогласување во Светото Писмо, бидејќи во едно од евангелијата ни е кажано дека кога Јуда се вратил и се обидел да ги врати парите, тие рекле: „Еј, тоа е твој проблем. Не можеме да го земеме.“ И го вратиле во храмската ризница. "Тоа е крв пари." Потоа тој го фрли таму на подот на храмот и тој излезе и се обеси. Тука Петар ни кажува дека тој падна со глава и само се појави. И постојат оние кои се замислува несогласување. Многу едноставно, тој се качи на дрвото за да се обеси, го врза јажето околу вратот и го врза за екстремитетот и скокна. И силата на падот или го скрши јажето или главата, и тој падна надолу во кањонот и токму како што рече тука.<br/>Тоа беше познато на сите жители на Ерусалим, така што полето се нарекува на нивниот јазик, Aceldama, што значи: полето на крвта. Зашто е напишано во книгата на Псалмите: „Нека биде пусто неговото живеалиште, и никој да не живее во него; и епископството негово нека го земе друг“ (Дела 1:19-20).<br/>Сега, во реалноста, тој цитира од два различни Псалми тука. Од Псалм 69:25 , тој го става заедно со Псалм 109:8 . И ставање на двете заедно тој наоѓа овие пророштва во врска со Јуда.<br/>Затоа од овие луѓе (Дела 1:21)<br/>Сега тука тие бараат некој да го земе местото на Јуда да биде апостол. Еве ги квалификациите што ги бараа во тоа време.<br/>Затоа од овие луѓе, кои беа со нас цело време кога Господ Исус влезе и излезе меѓу нас (Дела 1:21),<br/>Сега се сеќавате дека имаше многу ученици, од кои многу ученици Исус избра десет да бидат апостоли. И зборот апостол значи "еден кој е испратен." Или избра дванаесет да бидат апостоли, па Тој ги испрати дванаесет. Бројот на човечкото владеење. "Ние имаме само единаесет. Ни треба еден да го заземе местото на Јуда, но ни треба еден кој е со нас цело време од почетокот со Исус."<br/>Од денот кога беше крстен од Јован, па сè до денот кога беше земен од нас, некој мора да биде сведок на Неговото воскресение (Дела 1:22).<br/>Значи, тоа беа барањата што ги бараа. Некој кој беше околу целото време. Од времето на крштавањето на Јован до вознесувањето. И оној кој го виде воскреснатиот Господ, и на тој начин можеше да го носи фактот на воскресението, нивното сведоштво за фактот.<br/>Апостолот Павле, подоцна тврдејќи дека е апостол, рече: „Зарем не го видов воскреснатиот Христос?“ Очигледно тоа било едно од барањата на апостолството. Некој ме прашал: „Дали денес има апостоли?“ Па, не знам. Мислам дека не постојат во истата смисла како што беа во Новиот Завет. Сигурно нема никој денес кој може да сведочи за воскресението како што го направија.<br/>И поставија двајца, Јосиф наречен Варсава, кој се викаше Јуст, и Матија. И тие се молеа, велејќи: „Ти, Господи, кој ги познаваш срцата на сите луѓе, покажи дали си ги избрал од овие двајца (Дела 1:23-24),<br/>Мислам дека ние често се направи оваа грешка на давање на Господ две избори, и погрешни. Ограничување на Бог, гледате. Ние сме толку склони да го стори ова. Очигледно, Павле беше Божји избор. Питер беше напрегнат, и скокна со пиштолот и рече, "Еј, мораме да направиме нешто, знаеш, мораме да му помогнеме на Бог. Знаеш, еден е исчезнат и мораме да го пополниме." И сепак, "Боже, кој од овие двајца сакаш?" И му дадовме на Бог два избора.<br/>за да може да учествува во оваа служба и во ова апостолство, од кои Јуда со престап падна, за да може да оди на своето место. И така тие ги дадоа своите жртви (Дела 1:25-26);<br/>Интересен начин на кој тие се обиделе да се утврди волјата Божја. Ајде да се фрли коцки, дознаете што Божјата волја е тука. Тоа е интересно за мене, различни начини на кои луѓето се осмислени да се разликуваат волјата Божја. Сега, во старозаветните времиња тие имале интересен начин да дојдат до свештеникот, кој ќе го побара Господ за нив преку Урим и Тумим, "светлините и совршенствата". Само што овие Урим и Тумим биле, не знаеме. Сигурна сум дека тоа не биле обоените очила што Џозеф Смит ги нашол со Златните плочи; магичните очила, дека кога ќе ги ставите, одеднаш можете да го прочитате хиероглифскиот натпис.<br/>Постојат оние кои велат дека Урим и Тумим биле всушност црно-бел камен кој се носел во торба на градите на свештеникот. Тие ќе се молат и да му постави на Господ одредено прашање. Се сеќаваш ли дека Давид му поставуваше на Господа конкретни прашања: „Господи, да излеземе ли против Филистејците?“ Одговорот беше: „Не.“ И така, следниот ден: „Господи, да излеземе ли против Филистејците?“ Одговорот беше: „Да.“ „Кога ќе излеземе?“ Тие ќе поставуваат конкретни прашања, и Господ ќе ги води преку Урим и Тумин. Тие велат дека свештеникот ќе се молат, бараат Бог, а потоа се протегаат и извади еден од двата камења. Ако тоа беше бел камен, тоа беше да одговор. Ако тоа беше не, тогаш тоа би бил црниот камен што ќе го извади. Некои дури велат дека го добиваме терминот blackballed од овој Urim и Thummim. Всушност, назад во оригиналот тоа е не гласање против одреден проект или идеја. Не знаеме што биле Урим и Тумим, но во текот на Стариот Завет, тие користеле метод на фрлање жрепки за да ја одредат Божјата волја.<br/>И така, тука учениците го фаќаат истото како што фрлаат коцки за да видат кој од двајцата кои Бог ги избрал да го замени Јуда Искариотски.<br/>Жрепката падна на Матија; тој беше вброен со единаесетте (Дела 1:26).<br/>Сега кој во светот е Матија? Никој не слушнал за него порано или откако. Тоа ќе биде интересно да се сретне со Матија и да дознаете кој е тој и она што тој го направи. Мислам од следната историја, тоа е очигледно да се претпостави дека Бог го избра Павле како апостол. Павле го прогласува за себе. Сега ова е последен пат кога читаме за нив се обидуваат да се разликуваат волјата Божја со фрлање на жрепки или со случајни вид на нешто.<br/>Знам еден човек денес, во обид да ја разликува волјата Господова, ќе се моли и ќе Му постави прашање на Господ. Ќе има десет пени во џебот, и додека се моли, ќе ги земе со затворени очи и ќе ги стави на масата, и ако сите излезат на глава, тоа е да. Интересна работа, од време на време, сите тие ќе излезат на ум, и тоа е прилично добра шанса. Сепак, не наоѓаме никаков модел за ова откако Светиот Дух беше даден. Откако Светиот Дух дојде на црквата, тогаш Светиот Дух почна да зборува со нив и да ги насочува. И Светиот Дух рече: "Одвоете ми Павле и Варнава за службата каде што ги повикав" ( Дела 13:2). И Светиот Дух ги испрати надвор. Значи ние се најде црквата повеќе директно водени од Светиот Дух. Откако Светиот Дух дојде, ова фрлање коцки да дознаете волјата Божја беше ставен на страна.<br/>"<br/><br/>Кралот Џејмс<br/><br/>Ова е верзијата на Светата Библија од кралот Џејмс од 1769 година (позната и како Овластен превод). |

Yes that is correct, the Urbanears don't have a built in noise cancelling mic on the headphone itself but from what I can see there is a mic on the cable provided.<br/>1.

In fact, dynamic drivers work exactly the same as dynamic microphones but in reverse. Inside a dynamic driver there is a magnet, and when you plug in the headphones, you are sending a AC current through it which will turn the voice coil into a magnet. Depending on the direction of the current, the polarity of the magnet will change. Now since we know for a magnet, same charges repels and different charges attract, we know that the voice coil will move back and forth depending on it's polarity at the time. The voice coil is attached to the diaphragm which will then move back and forth creating a sound wave. The same occurs in reverse, if you move a coil through a magnet you produce a current instead. Since your voice is pushing the diaphragm, it is moving the voice coil back and forth generating the current you have observed.<br/><br/>100+ Head-Fier<br/><br/>Joined:<br/>Nov 7, 2011<br/><br/>Posts:<br/>134<br/><br/>Likes: 55<br/><br/>Exactly.

Во зависност од насоката на струјата, поларитетот на магнетот ќе се промени. Сега, бидејќи знаеме за магнет, истите полнежи се одбиваат и различни полнежи се привлекуваат, знаеме дека гласовната серпентина ќе се движи напред-назад во зависност од поларитетот во тоа време. Гласот серпентина е прикачен на дијафрагмата која потоа ќе се движат напред и назад создавање на звучен бран. Истото се случува во обратна, ако се движат серпентина преку магнет ќе произведе струја наместо.

After Lenin's death in 1924, the original party ...view middle of the document...<br/><br/>He controlled all aspects of people's lives; Culture; careers and jobs, even where they lived (collectivisation).<br/>The physical damage that was inflicted on the Party as a result of the show trials also hurt the political enforcement of Bolshevik ideals in Russian politics. Stalin's opposition within the party, including Bukharin, Yagoda and Rykov were purged in these show trials, as Stalin manipulatively forced them to confess to crimes of planning a coup and opposing the state, even if there was no proof. Gabor T Rittersporn said, "Many of the victims were sincerely devoted to the principles of Bolshevism." This amplifies proof that the Bolshevik ideals that had once been the roots of the Communist Party were being disarranged and destroyed by the Purges. The party was depleted and former members helplessly watched Stalin use the great purge as a tool to transform Russia from a one party state to an unchallenged dictatorship. Again, the purges were shattering the framework of the Communist Party, formed during the Bolshevik revolution. This agrees with the "Stalin the executioner" source as both show the manipulative character, that helped the dictator to enhance his grip on Russia's throat.<br/>The manipulative manner, with which Stalin incriminated his targeted opposition during the purges, in the eyes of everyday Russians, also had an implosive impact on Soviet Society. Stalin was able to collect support from the people through his use of propaganda and the media to help him develop a "cult of personality" and the image of a heroic and brave leader. Through this support Stalin implanted mistrust into the minds of the people, convincing them that traitors of the revolution and what he described as 'enemies of the people', were amongst them.

Опозицијата на Сталин во партијата, вклучувајќи ги Бухарин, Јагода и Риков, беа исчистени во овие судења, бидејќи Сталин манипулативно ги принуди да признаат злосторства на планирање државен удар и спротивставување на државата, дури и ако немаше докази. Габор Т. Ритерспорн рече: „Многу од жртвите беа искрено посветени на принципите на болшевизмот.“ Ова го засилува доказот дека болшевичките идеали кои некогаш биле корените на Комунистичката партија биле разурнати и уништени од чистките. Партијата беше исцрпена и поранешните членови беспомошно гледаа како Сталин ја користи големата чистка како алатка за трансформирање на Русија од еднопартиска држава во неоспорна диктатура. Повторно, чистките ја кршеа рамката на Комунистичката партија, формирана за време на болшевичката револуција. Ова се согласува со изворот „Сталин џелатот“, бидејќи и двете покажуваат манипулативен карактер, кој му помогна на диктаторот да го зајакне своето стегање на грлото на Русија.<br/>Манипулативниот начин со кој Сталин ја инкриминираше својата целна опозиција за време на чистките, во очите на секојдневните Руси, исто така имаше имплозивно влијание врз советското општество. Сталин бил во можност да собере поддршка од народот преку неговата употреба на пропаганда и медиуми за да му помогне да развие „култ на личноста“ и слика на херојски и храбар лидер. Преку оваа поддршка Сталин всадил недоверба во умовите на луѓето, убедувајќи ги дека предавниците на револуцијата и она што тој го опиша како „непријатели на народот“, биле меѓу нив.

| Supercell is nerfing brawlers instead of nerfing star powers. I was at 750 last season with power 8 nita and it is very tough to go past that, like, star powers play a really dominant role. The matchmaking is also trash. When i play gem grab(around 600 trophies), there are often matchups where the enemy team has one more player than us who is maxed and it's not even that we have a lvl 9 to compete versus that. Sometimes there are even matchups where the enemy team is fully maxed and none of us are. this is why i dont play brawl stars seriously anymore. It's not even like there arent many players who are not maxed and around 600 trophies. It's annoying.<br/>Edit: I think supercell should have at least a basic mechanism that takes the average of levels of brawlers when setting up matches.<br/><br/>Except trophies don't really indicate your skill. They indicate the skill of the teammates you are placed with. And I'm fine with playing against higher level brawlers, but when one team is all level 10 and the other team isn't, clearly it's unbalanced.<br/><br/>I reccomend getting some good friends to play with, me and 2 friends got my friends power 1 tick to rank 28 by playing gem grab with a certain composition all day and we made it without a single one of us being maxed with our brawlers.<br/><br/>I Know how you feel I used to have brawlers in high trophies with low level and it's to difficult to go more further and everything I was saying to myself "I want to have star powers" really supercell needs to make balance to the star powers or at least make a better matchmaking system.<br/><br/>I kinda feel this. I ain't as good at the game as you, but I got Emz to 500 at power 1 and the matchmaking was horrible. Maxed out players everywhere! And it didn't help that the majority of my teammates had around 5-8k trophies... I had to resort to solo showdown last minute because I can either ambush unsuspecting players or simply play a little aggressive at the right times. But I really wish that it could be a bit easier for people who want to push brawlers to really high trophy ranges without having the luxury of star powers.<br/><br/>Altho spike is still good without curveball. Curveball was just a help for hitting your shots more often as spike. But even before curveball was released, spike was a really strong brawler, so he will remain the same now.<br/><br/>I agree that they should have nerfed ambush, but I think they are trying to balance both Snappy Sniping and Ambush, as they are both getting merged with this change. She was becoming a little powerful, but still not nerf-worthy<br/><br/>I'm not sure about this, but now that Darryl got a noticeable buff, looking at their new stats, it looks like Darryl might overshadow Bull, as not only he can always deal more damage than Bull, he won't die as early anymore, so their survivability will be similar without star power (although Bull's survivability is still noticeably better than Darryl's if he had Tough Guy). Not only that, Darryl's super can auto regenerate, meaning Darryl MIGHT be able to be played effectively both as a heavyweight AND an assassin at the same time (before he sucks as a heavyweight but decent as an assassin)<br/><br/>But hes overrated af. And you get trophies with him really easily. So im kinda ok with the nerf. I havent even played him since when I got him to 500 (around 5 months ago), so not that I care that much either.<br/><br/>Why doesn't Poco/Penny get a HP nerf, if they are Marksman/Healer respectively not a tank?<br/>Why isn't Rosa's tankyness nerfed, cough 70% damage reduction?<br/>Why is Tick allowed to have the highest range and the most free pokedamage in the entire game?<br/>Why doesn't Leon get a HP/Damage buff?<br/><br/>Be that as it may, it was Ambush that was OP, not base Piper. I would argue that Ambush is the best star power in the game (now even more so since the percentage of damage increase indirectly went up) and base Piper was a bottom-10 brawler.<br/><br/>What Supercell should do is revert both nerfs, reduce Ambush to 600, and reduce Snappy Sniping to 0.25 since it'd be indirectly buffed by the base damage buff.<br/><br/>Yea and I believe they went a bit too far with Rosa, because now she is basically the better bull now when it comes to tanking, which she has been for a while. Now, Darryl might as well be a smaller, more powerful bull<br/><br/>Why? I feel she needs a buff in almost everything except her star power. Her health and speed make her super a bit more difficult to use, because she can die pretty easily, and it is really difficult for her to trap faster brawlers like Crow. Her star power is a bit broken though... | Supercell е нервозен кавгаџии наместо нервозен ѕвезда овластувања. Бев на 750 минатата сезона со моќ 8 нита и тоа е многу тешко да се помине покрај тоа, како, ѕвезда овластувања играат навистина доминантна улога. Матцхмакинг е исто така ѓубре. Кога играм грабање на скапоцен камен (околу 600 трофеи), често се случуваат натпревари каде што непријателскиот тим има еден играч повеќе од нас кој е максимален и тоа не е дури ни дека ние имаме lvl 9 да се натпреваруваме против тоа. Понекогаш има дури и натпревари каде што непријателот тим е целосно максимизирана и никој од нас не се. тоа е причината зошто јас не играат тепачка ѕвезди сериозно повеќе. Тоа не е ни како постојат многу играчи кои не се максимизирани и околу 600 трофеи. Тоа е досадно.<br/>Уредување: Мислам дека supercell треба да има барем основен механизам кој го зема просекот на нивоа на кавгаџии при поставување на натпревари.<br/><br/>Освен што трофеите не ја покажуваат вашата вештина. Тие ја покажуваат вештината на соиграчите со кои сте поставени. И јас сум во ред да играм против борци на повисоко ниво, но кога еден тим е на ниво 10, а другиот тим не е, јасно е дека е неуравнотежен.<br/><br/>Јас препорачувам добивање на некои добри пријатели да си играат со, јас и 2 пријатели доби моите пријатели моќ 1 крлеж да рангира 28 со играње скапоцен камен грабне со одредена композиција во текот на целиот ден и ние го направивме тоа без ниту еден од нас се максимизира со нашите кавгаџии.<br/><br/>Знам како се чувствувате кога имав кавгаџии во високи трофеи со ниско ниво и тешко е да се оди понатаму и сè што си велев себеси "сакам да имам ѕвездени моќи" навистина суперклетка треба да се направи рамнотежа на ѕвездени моќи или барем да се направи подобар систем за натпреварување.<br/><br/>Некако го чувствувам ова. Не сум толку добар во играта како тебе, но го добив Емз на 500 на моќност 1 и натпреварувањето беше ужасно. Максирани играчи насекаде! И тоа не помогна што повеќето од моите соиграчи имаа околу 5-8k трофеи ... Морав да прибегнам кон соло натпреварот во последен момент, бидејќи можам или да ги нападнам играчите кои не се сомневаат или едноставно да играм малку агресивно во вистинско време. Но, навистина би сакал тоа да биде малку полесно за луѓето кои сакаат да ги туркаат кавгаџиите до навистина високи трофеи без да го имаат луксузот на ѕвездените моќи.<br/><br/>Altho шилото е сеуште добро без curveball. Curveball беше само помош за удирање на вашите снимки почесто како шило. Но, дури и пред да биде ослободен curveball, шилото беше навистина силен кавгаџија, па тој ќе остане ист сега.<br/><br/>Се согласувам дека тие треба да имаат нервен заседа, но мислам дека тие се обидуваат да се балансира и Snappy Sniping и заседа, како и двете се добива споени со оваа промена. Таа стана малку моќен, но сепак не нервен-достоен<br/><br/>Не сум сигурен за ова, но сега кога Дерил доби забележлив баф, гледајќи ги нивните нови статистики, изгледа дека Дерил може да го засени Бул, бидејќи не само што тој секогаш може да направи повеќе штета од Бул, тој нема да умре толку брзо, така што нивната преживување ќе биде слична без моќ на ѕвездата (иако преживувањето на Бул е сеуште забележливо подобро од Дерил). Не само тоа, супер Дерил може да се регенерира автоматски, што значи дека Дерил може да биде одигран и како тешка категорија и како убиец во исто време (пред да биде за никаде како тешка категорија, но пристоен како убиец).<br/><br/>Но, тој е преценет аф. И ќе добиете трофеи со него навистина лесно. Па им некако во ред со нервот. Јас дури и не го играв од кога го добив на 500 (пред околу 5 месеци), па не дека ми е гајле толку многу.<br/><br/>Зошто Poco/Penny не добие HP нерв, ако тие се Марксмен/Исцелител соодветно, а не резервоар?<br/>Зошто кај Роза не е направено 70% намалување на штетата од кашлицата?<br/>Зошто на Тик му е дозволено да има највисок опсег и најслободен покедамаге во целата игра?<br/>Зошто Лион не доби ХП / Дамаге баф?<br/><br/>Како и да е, тоа беше заседа која беше ОП, а не база Пајпер. Јас би тврдел дека заседата е најдобрата ѕвезда моќ во играта (сега уште повеќе, бидејќи процентот на зголемување на штетата индиректно се зголеми) и база Пајпер беше долниот 10 кавгаџија.<br/><br/>Она што Supercell треба да го направи е да ги врати и двете нерви, да го намали Ambush на 600 и да го намали Snappy Sniping на 0,25 бидејќи индиректно ќе биде погоден од основната штета.<br/><br/>Да и јас верувам дека отидоа малку предалеку со Роза, бидејќи сега таа е во основа подобриот бик сега кога станува збор за танкирање, што таа е веќе некое време. Сега, Дерил може да биде и помал, помоќен бик<br/><br/>Зошто? Чувствувам дека има потреба од буф во речиси сè освен нејзината ѕвездена моќ. Нејзиното здравје и брзина ја прават супер малку потешко да се користи, бидејќи таа може да умре прилично лесно, и навистина е тешко за неа да стапи во стапица побрзи борци како Врана. Моќта на ѕвездата е малку скршена... |

| Self-Employment Part 1<br/><br/>When you accept an employment in any organisation, you have to perform various jobs as per the requirements of your employer and you may get a fixed amount of income as salary. You may run a small retail shop, tailoring shop, restaurant, bakery and confectionery, beauty salon, etc. in your locality. You may get engaged in trading or manufacturing on a small scale or providing some service for a price. Such economic activities are known as self-employment.<br/><br/>Meaning of Self-Employment<br/><br/>Earning is necessary for a living. Our father, mother, brothers, sisters and others may be engaged in different economic activities through which they earn their livelihood. These persons are engaged in an economic activity which is termed as wage employment or paid employment. But there are many persons who engage themselves in an occupation or some business which they start and manage on their own. They put in their best effort and take all types of risks to pursue their careers successfully. The entire earning of their work goes to them. All of us have seen small grocery shops, tailoring shops, medical stores etc. in our locality. These are owned and managed by a person, with or without the help of some assistants. Their economic activities are termed as self-employment. So, when an individual engages in any economic activity and manages it on his own, it is known as self-employment.<br/><br/>Objectives<br/><br/>After studying this lesson, you will be able to:<br/><br/>Image of Objectives<br/><br/>Image of Objectives<br/><br/>Characteristics of Self-Employment<br/><br/>It involves ownership and management of activities by a person although he/she may take the help of one or two persons to assist him/her. Thus, self-employment may provide employment to other persons as well.<br/><br/>The earning from self-employment is not fixed. It depends on the income one can earn by producing or buying and selling goods or providing services to others at a price.<br/><br/>In self-employment, the owner alone has to take the profit and bear the risk of loss. So, we find a direct link between the effort and reward in self-employment.<br/><br/>It requires some amount of capital investment, although it may be small.<br/><br/>In self-employment, a person is free to take decisions in respect of running his business profitably and avail of any opportunity that may come up for expansion of his business. It gives complete freedom to work as per one's own will and within the parameters of the prevailing laws.<br/><br/>Thus, self-employment may be defined as, an economic activity which one may perform on his own as a gainful occupation, and this may consist of producing and selling goods, buying and selling goods, or rendering services for a price. | Самовработување дел 1<br/><br/>Кога прифаќате вработување во било која организација, мора да вршите различни работни места според барањата на вашиот работодавач и може да добиете фиксен износ на приход како плата. Можете да водите мала продавница за малопродажба, продавница за кроење, ресторан, пекарница и слатки, салон за убавина, итн. Во вашата локалитет. Можете да се вклучите во трговија или производство во мал обем или да обезбедите некоја услуга за цена. Таквите активности се нарекуваат самовработување.<br/><br/>Значење на самовработувањето<br/><br/>Заработката е неопходна за живот. Нашите татко, мајка, браќа, сестри и други можат да бидат ангажирани во различни економски активности преку кои заработуваат за живот. Овие лица се вклучени во економска активност која се нарекува платено вработување или платено вработување. Но, постојат многу лица кои се вклучени во професија или некој бизнис што тие почнуваат и управуваат сами. Тие вложуваат најдобри напори и преземаат сите видови ризици за успешно да ја извршуваат својата кариера. Целата заработка од нивната работа оди кај нив. Сите ние сме виделе мали продавници за храна, продавници за прилагодување, медицински продавници итн. во нашата локалитет. Овие се во сопственост и управуваат од страна на лице, со или без помош на некои помошници. Нивните економски активности се нарекуваат самовработување. Значи, кога поединецот се вклучи во било која економска активност и управува со неа сам, тоа е познато како самовработување.<br/><br/>Цели<br/><br/>По проучувањето на оваа лекција, ќе бидете во можност да:<br/><br/>Имиџот на целите<br/><br/>Имиџот на целите<br/><br/>Карактеристики на самовработување<br/><br/>Тоа вклучува сопственост и управување со активностите од страна на едно лице, иако тој / таа може да земе помош од едно или две лица да му помогнат. Така, самовработувањето може да обезбеди вработување и на други лица.<br/><br/>Заработката од самовработување не е фиксна. Тоа зависи од приходот што може да се заработи со производство или купување и продажба на стоки или обезбедување на услуги на другите по цена.<br/><br/>Во самовработување, сопственикот сам мора да го преземе профитот и да го сноси ризикот од загуба. Значи, наоѓаме директна врска помеѓу напорот и наградата во самовработувањето.<br/><br/>Тоа бара одредена количина на капитална инвестиција, иако може да биде мала.<br/><br/>Во самовработувањето, лицето е слободно да донесува одлуки во врска со профитабилното водење на својот бизнис и да ја искористи секоја можност која може да се појави за проширување на неговиот бизнис. Таа дава целосна слобода да се работи според сопствената волја и во рамките на параметрите на преовладувачките закони.<br/><br/>Така, самовработувањето може да се дефинира како економска активност која може да се врши самостојно како профитна професија, а тоа може да се состои од производство и продажба на стоки, купување и продажба на стоки или обезбедување на услуги за одредена цена. |
