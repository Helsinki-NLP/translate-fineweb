In simple terms, the condition is characterized by: one develops a kidney disease and undergoes a kidney transplant and other diseases associated with acidic concentration in the blood and gout. In theory, the condition will occur even if the genetic change is inherited from one parent and sporadically occurs when there is no family history.<br/><br/>Common names of autosomal dominant interstitial kidney disease<br/><br/>The condition has other names as well namely: medullary cystic kidney disease, although this name is not used as much because most people suffering from this condition do not have medullary cysts. It is also referred to as juvenile hyperuricemic nephropathy. The disease tends to affect people of ages 20 to 50. The latter condition as aforementioned occurs in young children, something, which translate to get it from both parents.<br/>Cystic kidney disease is an inherited condition whereby the cysts in the centre of each kidney gradually lose their ability to function properly. Cysts refer to abnormal blisters of fluid in the kidney. The condition further scares the kidney making unable to concentrate the urine and as a result, producing too much urine. Its symptoms include excessive urination, salt cravings, weakness, confusion, bleeding, fatigue, frequent hiccups, low blood pressure, nausea and vomiting, headaches, pale skin, reduced sensation in the hands, weight loss among many others. Other complications include: anemia, ulcers, loss of bone density, infertility and other heart related problems.<br/>Its analysis incorporates blood tests to check for sodium levels and general kidney functions, urine tests to check the levels of concentration and other imbalances, x rays to check for the size of kidneys that may be altered owing to increased urine concentrations, renal biopsy and genetic testing to verify any genetic changes that might have taken place in due time.<br/>While the disease does not have a cut and dry treatment to it, one may focus on controlling measures, which include intake of fluids and salt to supplement the one lost as the disease progresses into latter stages. This also helps reduce dehydration. Other treatments include taking of prescribed medication and diet changes and minimal intakes of foods containing phosphorous and potassium. Further complications may also require one to have a kidney transplant. Basically, this is not a curable disease but rather a manageable once detected in the early stages.<br/><br/>The common yet different factor of Autosomal dominant interstitial kidney disease<br/><br/>Nephronophthisis and medullary cystic kidney disease are mainly grouped together because, in essence, they share the same features but with a slight difference in regards inheritance patterns to the former affecting children and the latter affecting young adults and older age groups. Similar features for both are ADH resistant urine concentration that leads to polyuria and polydipsia, anemia and renal diseases.<br/>The former aforementioned condition is Autosomal recessive accounting to 15% of chronic diseases and causes ESRD during early childhood while the latter is Autosomal dominant with a few sporadic new mutations and causes ESRD for people between the ages of 30 and 50. | Онлајн ЦПР сертификација блог<br/><br/>Датум: 23 јули, 2014<br/><br/>Автосомна доминантна интерстициска бубрежна болест е ретка збирка на болести кои влијаат на познатите функции на бубрезите.

| Hobbes' vs. Locke's Account on the State of Nature<br/><br/>Topic: PhilosophyWords: 2539Pages: 9Aug 3rd, 2021<br/><br/>Hobbes and Locke are among the most influential political philosophers to ever write in English. The state of nature, which precedes the organization of the complex societies, is the common premise that both Hobbes and Locke share but interpret in different ways. The former views humans in their natural state as equally dangerous and free to pursue their egoistic goals unrestricted by the nonexistent notions of justice, which is why his natural state amounts to the "war of every man against every man" (Hobbes76). The latter, on the other hand, views humans in their original condition as equally valuable and restricts natural freedom by the idea of justice that requires not to harm others, which allows defining the state of nature as "mutual assistance and preservation" rather than war (Locke 15). The key difference between the two philosophers' accounts of natural state is that Locke uses ethical considerations while Hobbes does not, and it ultimately leads Hobbes to envisage a state exercising unlimited power over human beings, while Locke limits the government by the moral principles, which he considers a natural law.<br/><br/>Hobbes bases his assumptions regarding the state of nature on the fact that all people are roughly equal in their physical and mental capabilities. He admits that some individuals may demonstrate greater physical strength or superior intellect but insists that "when all is reckoned together, the difference between man and man is not so considerable" (Hobbes 74). Since humans are roughly equal in their capabilities, they also have similar hopes to attain their ends and satisfy their needs (Hobbes 75). As a logical outcome of this equality, when the people begin competing for scarce resources, no one may feel entirely secure in his or her possessions. Even if a mighty, cunning, and capable person succeeds in subjugating "the persons of all men he can," it still does not guarantee the ultimate security (Hobbes 75). As no human can obtain such superiority over the others that renders him or her utterly immune to their strength of intellect, no human can feel completely safe when surrounded by his or her equals. Hobbes' equality in the natural state is equality of fear, where all humans view each other as dangerous competitors.<br/><br/>Just as Hobbes, Locke considers all human beings to be fundamentally equal, but assigns a very different meaning to the term. From his perspective, it is not the equality of capabilities, but, rather, the equality of value. He opines that the people "promiscuously born to all the same advantages of nature" should logically enjoy the perfect equality among them, as there is no reason to consider anyone inherently more valuable (Locke 8). The only possible foundation for designating some people as superior to others would be if God "by any manifest declaration of his will, set one above another" (Locke 8). Since such divine sanction of superiority is absent, Locke concludes that the natural equality of all representatives of humankind is not to be called into question. Hobbes approaches equality pragmatically and stresses that people in their natural state are equally dangerous, but Locke employs an ethical approach and emphasizes that humans are equally valuable in God's eyes. This disagreement is but the first difference between the two authors based on the fact that Locke includes God as a premise into his political philosophy, while Hobbes does not.<br/><br/>Another characteristic feature of Hobbes' account of the natural state is his interpretation of liberty. According to Hobbes, the state of nature implies unlimited freedom to do whatever is necessary for one's continued existence. The philosopher defines liberty as "the absence of external impediments" in using one's abilities to attain one's goals (Hobbes 79). The primary purpose of every sentient being is to maintain its continued existence. As a consequence, Hobbesian freedom amounts to the unhindered opportunity to do anything that, in one's judgment, would be best suited to preserve one's life and possessions (Hobbes 79). The only limitation to liberty is that a person cannot do anything contradictory to sustaining his or her life or destroying "the means of preserving the same" (Hobbes 79). Apart from that, there are no boundaries, and everyone has "a right to everything, even to one another's body" if that furthers one's survival (Hobbes 80). Thus, natural liberty, as viewed by Hobbes, is the absence of externally enforced obstacles in pursuing one's right to everything to sustain and secure one's continued existence.<br/><br/>Locke also upholds the idea of natural liberty but, unsurprisingly, approaches it in a manner that is significantly different from that of Hobbes. As soon as he begins discussing liberty in the state of nature, he immediately notes that a state of freedom does not equate "a state of license" (Locke 9). The philosopher identifies two specific limitations to human freedom in the state of nature. The first one is identical to that introduce by Hobbes: however free and independent, a person nevertheless "has not liberty to destroy himself" (Locke 9). Yet the second limitation contradicts Hobbes' prepositions directly. According to Locke, every human being has a natural obligation not to "harm another in his life, health, liberty, or possessions" (9). Just as with his interpretation of equality, the author bases this assertion on ethical and religious grounds: people should preserve each other's existence since they are all creations of the same "omnipotent, and infinitely wise maker" (Locke 9). Thus, Locke's limits liberty in the natural state far more stringently than Hobbes by introducing the obligation to refrain from harming both oneself and the others.<br/><br/>The differences between the two authors also manifest in their accounts of justice in the natural state of humanity. As far as Hobbes is concerned, delineating just and unjust practices is merely the matter of the law. There is no jurisprudence in the state of nature, and the only law governing human beings in their original condition is a natural law that only obliges them to seek personal security. As a result, nothing can be unjust in the original state of the humankind: "notions of right and wrong justice and injustice" have no place and no meaning in the absence of the stringently enforced law (Hobbes 78). As long as the people use their virtually unlimited freedom to ruthlessly compete with each other for resources, to which they are equally entitled, they have no criteria to differentiate between just and unjust actions. Therefore, the Hobbesian state of nature defies the very idea of justice since the author interprets it as a mere function of the formalized and established law.<br/><br/>Locke assigns different meaning to justice and views it not so much in legislative as in the ethical terms. This paper already mentioned that, unlike Hobbes, Locke employs ethical notions and generally bases his political philosophy on moral rather than purely practical presumptions. Locke's natural law, unlike that of Hobbes, obliges human beings to take care of each other rather than simply leaving everyone to fend for themselves. As a result, there is a place for justice and injustice in his state of nature. The author points to this fact himself when noting that no one should deprive another of his or her life of the means of preserving it "unless it be to do justice on an offender" (Locke 9). This statement reveals with the utmost clarity that, according to Locke, there is justice in the state of nature, and, moreover, humans have to preserve it actively. The criterion of justice, which Hobbes' natural state lacks, is the second limitation on natural liberty imposed by Locke: an action is unjust if it constitutes an unwarranted threat to another person's life and possessions.<br/><br/>These differences in the two authors' treatment of equality, liberty, and justice or injustice culminate in their interpretation of the relationship between the state of nature and the state of war. From Hobbes's perspective, the two are synonymous, because the ruthless competition is the only logical outcome of putting people with equivalent capabilities and similar needs in an environment with limited resources. He states this connection outright: "if any two men desire the same thing, which nevertheless they cannot both enjoy, they become enemies" and are, therefore, in the state of war with each other (Hobbes 75). Yet since humans are numerous and all possess similar capabilities and needs, this competition manifests not only in the individual interactions but also on the level of humanity as a whole. As long as all humans have equal and unlimited rights to all resources and even to each other's bodies and lives, the state of nature is a war of "every man against every man" (Hobbes 76). This grim interpretation stems directly from Hobbes' portrayal of the state of nature as governed solely by the individuals' egoistic urges.<br/><br/>Locke, on the other hand, differentiates between the state of nature and the state of war and points out that, while they may occur simultaneously, it is no reason to identify one with the other. Locke's definition of the state of war is virtually identical to that offered by Hobbes. According to Locke, "he who attempts to get another man into his absolute power does thereby put himself into a state of war with him" (14). This explanation lines up perfectly with the Hobbesian notion that everyone's universal right to everything, including the other people's bodies and lives, leads to the state of war. Yet Locke refuses to equate the state of war and the state of nature precisely because he denies Hobbes' interpretation of natural freedom. Since Locke's natural state restrains people from harming each other through the second limitation of liberty, an attempt on another person's freedom is a transgression against the natural law. While for Hobbes, war is the humankind's condition by default, Locke portrays it as a perversion of the state of nature rather than its rule.<br/><br/>These differences in delineating the state on nature and its constituents, such as liberty, equality, justice, and war, pave the way to the authors contrasting portrayals of government. Based on his pessimistic assessment of the state of nature, the author of Leviathan concludes that, under conditions of war, there can be no definite hope for "living out the time which nature ordinarily alloweth men to live" (Hobbes 80). The solution is laying down the universal right to everything and leaving everyone "so much liberty against other men, as he would allow other men against himself" (Hobbes 80). The participants of the resulting social contract invest the unlimited liberties they have surrendered into a sovereign – the bearer of the supreme power whose purpose is to preserve the achieved status quo by punishing all transgressions against it. Sovereign's power is absolute: the ruler has the authority "to do whatsoever he shall think necessary" to promote peace between his subjects so that no one would assail another's life or property (113). Hobbes concludes that without such an unassailable figure entitled with the right to do anything to the subjects, there can be no peace and no guarantee of security.<br/><br/>While Locke agrees with the necessity of creating politically organized societies, he nevertheless opposes Hobbes' idea of the sovereign power as unlimited and unassailable. As mentioned above, Locke's state of nature is not nearly as dreadful as that painted by Hobbes because of the people's obligation to preserve not only themselves but each other as well. Therefore, the need for social contract arises not from the fear of the others, but from the sheer convenience. Small communities may not need numerous laws to solve conflicts and "officers to superintend the process," but larger associations find it advisable to institute governments for that purpose (Locke 57). Yet the power of the government cannot be unlimited because it would result in subduing the subjects to an "inconstant, uncertain, unknown, arbitrary will of another man" (Locke 17). Such a government would constitute a twofold violation of the natural law. By agreeing to another person's absolute power over his life, a subject would violate its first limitation prohibiting to harm oneself. As for the ruler, destroying another person's liberty would constitute direct harm and, as such, be contradictory to the second limitation.<br/><br/>As a direct continuation of his case for unlimited governmental authority, Hobbes denies the separation of powers as a principle. From his perspective, the sovereign, once instituted, possesses "the whole power of prescribing the rules" governing the lives of the subjects or, in shorter terms, the legislative power (Hobbes 114). The sovereign also reserves the right of "hearing and deciding all controversies" – that is, the judicial power (Hobbes 114). Finally, since the entire purpose of the sovereign is to force the subjects to refrain from harming each other, there can be no doubt that executive power is also his or her exclusive prerogative. The separation of powers as a concept is alien to Hobbes because of his views on the state of nature. Creating a political entity where the executive, legislative, and judicial branches would check each other – that is, compete – would mean recreating the Hobbesian state of nature-as-war on a higher level. Since the people enter a social contract and institute a government to put the state of nature behind them, not reinstate it in a different form, the separation of powers contradictory Hobbes' views directly.<br/><br/>Locke, on the other hand, embraces separation of power as a foundational principle of his political theory. His case for the separation is evident in the discussion of the limits of the legislative power. As Locke puts it, it would be hardly advisable "for the same persons, who have the power of making laws, to have also in their hands the power to execute them" (76). The philosopher points to the imperfections of human nature and the inherent desire to "grasp at power" as a rationale for this precautionary measure (Locke 76). Just as in Hobbes' case, Locke's account of the separation of powers stems directly from his interpretation of the state of nature. If there is already justice in the state of nature and the people can understand it, any government is inevitably subject to the same natural law. Since absolute power over people violates both limitations of this law, separating and distributing it is advisable so that the government would function appropriately.<br/><br/>This paper has demonstrated that, while the differences between Hobbes' and Locke's accounts of the natural state of humanity are numerous, they ultimately amount to the presence of absence of moral premises. Hobbes views the natural state as that of unlimited liberty, where people endowed with equal capabilities and not bound by any moral notions, such as justice, compete for the resources unceasingly. Locke, however, interprets equality and liberty ethically rather than practically and opines that war is a perversion of the natural state, as the natural law obliges humans not to harm each other. This disagreement influences the philosophers' approaches to government. Hobbes insists on an all-powerful ruler, as, in the absence of ethical restraints, no other authority could force the humans to refrain from harming each other. Yet, in Locke's view, granting the government unlimited powers would be contradictory to the ethical limitations embedded in the law of nature, which is why he, unlike Hobbes, advocates separation of powers. | Хобс наспроти Лок за состојбата на природата<br/><br/>Тема: ФилозофијаЗборови: 2539Страници: 9август 3rd, 2021<br/><br/>Хобс и Лок се меѓу највлијателните политички филозофи кои некогаш пишувале на англиски јазик. Состојбата на природата, која претходи на организацијата на сложените општества, е заедничка претпоставка дека и Хобс и Лок ги делат, но интерпретираат на различни начини. Поранешните сметаат дека луѓето во нивната природна состојба се подеднакво опасни и слободни да ги следат своите себични цели, неограничени од непостоечките поими за правдата, поради што неговата природна состојба се сведува на „војна на секој човек против секој човек“ (Хобс 76). Вториот, од друга страна, ги гледа луѓето во нивната првобитна состојба како подеднакво вредни и ја ограничува природната слобода со идејата за правда која бара да не им наштети на другите, што овозможува дефинирање на состојбата на природата како „взаемна помош и зачувување“, а не војна. Клучната разлика помеѓу двата филозофи за природната состојба е дека Лок ги користи етичките размислувања, додека Хобс не, и тоа на крајот го наведува Хобс да предвиди држава која врши неограничена моќ над човечките суштества, додека Лок ја ограничува владата со моралните принципи, кои тој ги смета за природен закон.<br/><br/>Хобс ги заснова своите претпоставки во врска со состојбата на природата на фактот дека сите луѓе се приближно еднакви во нивните физички и ментални способности. Тој признава дека некои индивидуи можат да покажат поголема физичка сила или супериорен интелект, но инсистира дека „кога се смета сè заедно, разликата помеѓу човекот и човекот не е толку значајна“ (Хобс 74). Бидејќи луѓето се приближно еднакви во своите способности, тие исто така имаат слични надежи да ги постигнат своите цели и да ги задоволат своите потреби (Хобс 75). Како логичен исход на оваа еднаквост, кога луѓето почнуваат да се натпреваруваат за оскудни ресурси, никој не може да се чувствува целосно безбеден во својот имот. Дури и ако еден моќен, лукав и способен човек успее да ги потчини „личностите на сите луѓе што може“, тоа сепак не гарантира крајна сигурност (Хобс 75). Бидејќи ниту еден човек не може да добие таква супериорност во однос на другите што го прави потполно имун на нивната сила на интелект, ниту еден човек не може да се чувствува сосема безбеден кога е опкружен со своите еднакви. Еднаквоста на Хобс во природната состојба е еднаквост на стравот, каде што сите луѓе се гледаат едни со други како опасни конкуренти.<br/><br/>Исто како Хобс, Лок ги смета сите човечки суштества за фундаментално еднакви, но му дава многу поинакво значење на терминот. Од негова перспектива, тоа не е еднаквост на способностите, туку, напротив, еднаквост на вредноста. Тој смета дека луѓето „промискуитетно родени од сите исти предности на природата“ логично треба да уживаат во совршената еднаквост меѓу нив, бидејќи нема причина да сметаме дека некој по своја природа е повреден (Лок 8). Единствената можна основа за прогласување на некои луѓе за повисоки од другите би била ако Бог „со секоја изјава на својата волја, постави еден над друг“ (Локк 8). Бидејќи таквата божествена дозвола за супериорност е отсутна, Лок заклучува дека природната еднаквост на сите претставници на човештвото не треба да се доведува во прашање. Хобс пристапува кон еднаквоста прагматично и нагласува дека луѓето во нивната природна состојба се подеднакво опасни, но Лок користи етички пристап и нагласува дека луѓето се подеднакво вредни во Божји очи. Ова несогласување е само првата разлика помеѓу двајцата автори врз основа на фактот дека Лок го вклучува Бог како премиса во неговата политичка филозофија, додека Хобс не.<br/><br/>Друга карактеристична карактеристика на Хобсовото прикажување на природната состојба е неговото толкување на слободата. Според Хобс, состојбата на природата подразбира неограничена слобода да се направи сè што е потребно за продолжување на постоење. Филозофот ја дефинира слободата како "одсуство на надворешни пречки" во користењето на своите способности за постигнување на своите цели (Хобс 79). Примарната цел на секое свесно суштество е да го одржи своето континуирано постоење. Како последица на тоа, Хобсовата слобода се состои од непречена можност да се направи сè што, по нечија проценка, би било најпогодно за зачувување на нечиј живот и имот (Хобс 79). Единственото ограничување на слободата е тоа што човекот не може да направи ништо противречно на одржувањето на својот живот или уништувањето на „средствата за зачувување на истиот“ (Хобс 79). Освен тоа, не постојат граници, и секој има „право на сè, дури и на телото на другиот“, ако тоа го подобрува нечиј опстанок (Хобс 80). Така, природната слобода, како што ја гледа Хобс, е отсуство на надворешно наметнати пречки во остварувањето на правото на сè за одржување и обезбедување на континуираното постоење.<br/><br/>Лок, исто така, ја поддржува идејата за природна слобода, но, изненадувачки, пристапува кон неа на начин кој е значително различен од оној на Хобс. Веднаш штом ќе почне да дискутира за слободата во состојбата на природата, тој веднаш забележува дека состојбата на слободата не се изедначува со "држава на лиценца" (Locke 9). Филозофот идентификува две специфични ограничувања на човековата слобода во состојбата на природата. Првиот е идентичен со оној што го воведе Хобс: колку и да е слободен и независен, лицето сепак „нема слобода да се уништи“ (Локе 9). Сепак, второто ограничување директно се спротивставува на предлозите на Хобс. Според Лок, секое човечко суштество има природна обврска да не му наштети на другиот во својот живот, здравје, слобода или имот. Исто како и со неговото толкување на еднаквоста, авторот го заснова ова тврдење на етички и религиозни основи: луѓето треба да го зачуваат егзистенцијата на едни со други, бидејќи сите тие се креации на истиот „семоќен и бесконечно мудар творец“ (Locke 9). Така, Лок ја ограничува слободата во природната состојба многу построго од Хобс со воведување на обврската да се воздржи од нанесување штета и на себеси и на другите.<br/><br/>Разликите меѓу двајцата автори, исто така, се манифестираат во нивните извештаи за правдата во природната состојба на човештвото. Што се однесува до Хобс, оцртувањето на праведните и неправедните практики е само прашање на законот. Во состојбата на природата не постои судска пракса, а единствениот закон кој управува со човечките суштества во нивната првобитна состојба е природен закон кој ги обврзува само да бараат лична безбедност. Како резултат на тоа, ништо не може да биде неправедно во првобитната состојба на човештвото: „поимите за исправна и погрешна правда и неправда“ немаат место и значење во отсуството на строго спроведен закон. Сè додека луѓето ја користат својата практично неограничена слобода да се натпреваруваат едни со други за ресурси, на кои тие имаат еднакво право, тие немаат критериуми за да разликуваат праведни и неправедни постапки. Затоа, Хобсовата состојба на природата се спротивставува на самата идеја за правда, бидејќи авторот ја толкува како пука функција на формализиран и воспоставен закон.<br/><br/>Лок ѝ придава различно значење на правдата и ја гледа не толку во законодавството, колку во етичките термини. Овој труд веќе спомна дека, за разлика од Хобс, Лок користи етички поими и генерално ја заснова својата политичка филозофија на морални, а не чисто практични претпоставки. Природниот закон на Лок, за разлика од оној на Хобс, ги обврзува луѓето да се грижат едни за други, наместо едноставно да ги остават сите да се грижат за себе. Како резултат на тоа, постои место за правда и неправда во неговата состојба на природата. Самиот автор укажува на овој факт кога истакнува дека никој не смее да го лиши некој друг од неговиот или нејзиниот живот од средствата за негово зачувување „освен ако тоа не е правда за престапникот“ (Locke 9). Оваа изјава открива со најголема јаснота дека, според Лок, постои правда во состојбата на природата, и, освен тоа, луѓето мора активно да ја зачуваат. Критериумот за правда, кој му недостасува на Хобс, е второто ограничување на природната слобода наметнато од Лок: дејството е неправедно ако претставува неоправдана закана за животот и имотот на друго лице.<br/><br/>Овие разлики во третманот на двајцата автори на еднаквоста, слободата и правдата или неправдата кулминираат во нивното толкување на односот помеѓу состојбата на природата и состојбата на војната. Од гледна точка на Хобс, овие две работи се синоними, бидејќи немилосрдната конкуренција е единствениот логичен резултат на ставање на луѓето со еднакви способности и слични потреби во средина со ограничени ресурси. Тој отворено ја наведува оваа поврзаност: "Ако двајца луѓе сакаат исто нешто, што и покрај тоа не можат да уживаат, тие стануваат непријатели" и затоа се во состојба на војна едни со други (Хобс 75). Сепак, бидејќи луѓето се бројни и сите поседуваат слични способности и потреби, оваа конкуренција се манифестира не само во индивидуалните интеракции, туку и на ниво на човештвото како целина. Додека сите луѓе имаат еднакви и неограничени права на сите ресурси, па дури и на телата и животите на едни со други, состојбата на природата е војна на „секој човек против секој човек“ (Хобс 76). Оваа мрачна интерпретација произлегува директно од Хобсовото прикажување на состојбата на природата како што е регулирана исклучиво од егоистичките нагони на поединците.<br/><br/>Лок, од друга страна, прави разлика помеѓу состојбата на природата и состојбата на војната и истакнува дека, иако тие можат да се појават истовремено, не е причина да се идентификува едната со другата. Локовата дефиниција за состојбата на војната е практично идентична со онаа понудена од Хобс. Според Лок, "оној кој се обидува да добие друг човек во неговата апсолутна моќ, на тој начин се става во состојба на војна со него" (14). Ова објаснување совршено се совпаѓа со Хобсовото сфаќање дека универзалното право на сите на сè, вклучувајќи ги и телата и животите на другите луѓе, води до состојба на војна. Сепак, Лок одбива да ја изедначи состојбата на војната и состојбата на природата токму затоа што ја негира Хобсовата интерпретација на природната слобода. Бидејќи природната состојба на Лок ги спречува луѓето да се повредуваат едни со други преку второто ограничување на слободата, обидот за слобода на друго лице е престап против природниот закон. Додека за Хобс, војната е стандардна состојба на човештвото, Лок ја прикажува како перверзија на состојбата на природата, а не како нејзино владеење.<br/><br/>Овие разлики во оцртувањето на државата за природата и нејзините конституенти, како што се слободата, еднаквоста, правдата и војната, го отвораат патот за авторите да ги спротивстават портретите на владата. Врз основа на неговата песимистичка проценка на состојбата на природата, авторот на Левијатан заклучува дека, во услови на војна, не може да постои одредена надеж за "живот на времето што природата обично дозволува луѓето да живеат" (Хобс 80). Решението е да се постави универзалното право на сè и да им се остави на сите "толку слобода против другите луѓе, колку што би дозволил другите луѓе против себе" (Хобс 80). Учесниците на резултирачкиот општествен договор ги вложуваат неограничените слободи што ги препуштиле во суверен – носител на врховната власт чија цел е да го зачува постигнатиот статус кво со казнување на сите престапи против него. Власта на владетелот е апсолутна: владетелот има овластување „да прави сè што смета дека е потребно“ за да промовира мир меѓу неговите поданици, така што никој да не го напаѓа животот или имотот на другиот. Хобс заклучува дека без таква непоколеблива фигура која има право да направи нешто за поданиците, не може да има мир и никаква гаранција за безбедност.<br/><br/>Додека Лок се согласува со потребата за создавање на политички организирани општества, тој сепак се спротивставува на Хобсовата идеја за суверена моќ како неограничена и непобедлива. Како што споменавме погоре, состојбата на природата на Лок не е ни приближно толку страшна како онаа насликана од Хобс поради обврската на луѓето да се зачуваат не само себеси туку и едни со други. Затоа, потребата за социјален договор не произлегува од стравот на другите, туку од чистата погодност. Малите заедници можеби немаат потреба од бројни закони за решавање на конфликти и „полицајци да го надгледуваат процесот“, но поголемите здруженија сметаат дека е препорачливо да се воспостават влади за таа цел (Locke 57). Сепак, моќта на владата не може да биде неограничена, бидејќи тоа би резултирало со потчинување на поданиците на "непостојана, несигурна, непозната, произволна волја на друг човек" (Locke 17). Таквата влада би претставувала двојно кршење на природниот закон. Со прифаќање на апсолутната моќ на друго лице над неговиот живот, субјектот ќе го прекрши своето прво ограничување, забранувајќи да се повреди себеси. Што се однесува до владетелот, уништувањето на слободата на друго лице би претставувало директна штета и како таква би било во спротивност со второто ограничување.<br/><br/>Како директно продолжение на неговиот случај за неограничена владина власт, Хобс ја негира поделбата на власта како принцип. Од негова перспектива, суверенот, еднаш воспоставен, ја поседува „целата моќ на пропишување на правилата“ кои управуваат со животите на субјектите или, накратко, законодавната моќ (Хобс 114). Суверенот, исто така, го задржува правото да „слушне и да ги реши сите контроверзии“ – односно судската власт (Хобс 114). Конечно, бидејќи целата цел на суверенот е да ги принуди субјектите да се воздржат од повредување на едни со други, не може да има сомнеж дека извршната власт е исто така негова ексклузивна прерогатива. Поделбата на моќта како концепт е туѓа за Хобс поради неговите ставови за состојбата на природата. Создавањето на политички ентитет во кој извршната, законодавната и судската власт ќе се проверуваат меѓусебно – односно ќе се натпреваруваат – би значело повторно создавање на Хобсовата состојба на природата како војна на повисоко ниво. Бидејќи луѓето влегуваат во општествен договор и воспоставуваат влада за да ја стават состојбата на природата зад нив, а не да ја враќаат во поинаква форма, поделбата на моќта директно се спротивставува на ставовите на Хобс.<br/><br/>Лок, од друга страна, ја прифаќа поделбата на власта како основен принцип на неговата политичка теорија. Неговиот случај за поделба е евидентен во дискусијата за границите на законодавната моќ. Како што вели Лок, тешко дека би било препорачливо „за истите лица, кои имаат моќ да прават закони, да имаат и моќ во нивните раце да ги извршуваат“ (76). Филозофот укажува на несовршеностите на човечката природа и вродената желба да се „ограничи на моќта“ како основа за оваа мерка на претпазливост (Locke 76). Како и во случајот на Хобс, Локовото објаснување за поделбата на моќите произлегува директно од неговата интерпретација на состојбата на природата. Ако веќе постои правда во состојбата на природата и луѓето можат да ја разберат, секоја влада неизбежно е подложна на истиот природен закон. Бидејќи апсолутната власт над луѓето ги крши двете ограничувања на овој закон, препорачливо е да се одвои и дистрибуира, така што владата ќе функционира соодветно.<br/><br/>Овој труд покажа дека, иако разликите помеѓу Хобс и Лок за природната состојба на човештвото се бројни, тие на крајот се сведуваат на присуство на отсуство на морални премиси. Хобс ја гледа природната состојба како состојба на неограничена слобода, каде што луѓето кои се обдарени со еднакви способности и не се врзани со никакви морални поими, како што е правдата, постојано се натпреваруваат за ресурсите. Лок, сепак, ги толкува еднаквоста и слободата етички, наместо практично, и смета дека војната е перверзија на природната состојба, бидејќи природниот закон ги обврзува луѓето да не се повредуваат едни со други. Хобс инсистира на семоќен владетел, бидејќи, во отсуство на етички ограничувања, ниту еден друг орган не може да ги принуди луѓето да се воздржат од повредување еден на друг. Сепак, според Лок, доделувањето на неограничени овластувања на владата би било во спротивност со етичките ограничувања вградени во законот на природата, поради што тој, за разлика од Хобс, се залага за поделба на власта. |
| Fashion Police: What Game of Thrones threw up<br/><br/>Canadian-French singer Abbas Hasan put blinding effort to outshine all of humanity at Fashion Parade 2014. Nothing wrong with that, except safety is priority and the musician is a health hazard here.<br/><br/>We get he wants to be a star. Sadly, he didn't get the memo where they tell the desperate and the infamous that stardom is a metaphor. You don't have to look like one and literally set our sight ablaze. Also, the All Pakistan Aunty Association has officially lodged a complaint against him. The local market has run dry of fake crystals and sequined monstrosities. They have nothing to wear to their biweekly high teas and they claim he is to blame. Apparently, the outfit is inspired by Game of Thrones. Can he please stick to composing sad songs about his neighbour's dead dog instead of conceptualising outfits? Or maybe it's the trauma of losing the dog, whose death he is clearly not over as he is still wearing its carcass.<br/><br/>The charge sheet Outfit<br/><br/>No one can decide where the outfit begins and where Abbas ends. You stare in fascination, sinking into a deep abyss and wonder why he is wearing leather pants. Whose horse did he kill to steal the saddle draped across his shoulders? Was he in prison right before his red carpet appearance and forgot to take off the chains? How will he survive the synthetic leather and post-sequin rash that is bound to be lethal in such high dosage? Why am I still alive?<br/><br/>Idea<br/><br/>His inspiration was seemingly Game of Thrones, but he eventually ended up looking like he was thrown out of a Viking restaurant. Had he come across any of the characters from the show, he would've been slain in the first five seconds of the first episode.<br/><br/>The mental health or lack thereof: Someone get him to a counsellor ASAP! He seems to be under the assumption that wearing a dead dog means that the only friend he had in his life is still alive. Dear Abbas:<br/><br/>1. Denial is not a river in Egypt<br/><br/>2. Your tortured psyche is not helping your music, so get help<br/><br/>3. Try imaginary friends<br/><br/>Bail out!<br/><br/>All of us at the Fashion Police headquarters are severely traumatised. Abbas is someone we did not enjoy arresting. He is currently in custody and attempting revenge by putting on attires from other fantasy shows. He just glitter glued himself in order to look like Edward Cullen from Twilight. As a public service message and to prevent further nervous breakdowns, we gave him the following examples of men from the red carpet of the same event.<br/><br/>Zohaib Hassan<br/><br/>When in doubt, play it safe. The singer looks like your average uncle at a shaadi. A plain black suit with no accessories, even if it's a tad disproportionate, is workable. Zohaib's look is blended into everything and nothing, and when you don't have a fashion sense or the money to hire a stylist, this is okay. It does not carry the risk of cardiac arrest for fellow attendees at an event. Given Abbas' delicate mental condition, this look is what he should aim for. Always and forever.<br/><br/>Ali Zafar<br/><br/>One day, after decades of therapy, Abbas could aspire to wear attire like Ali Zafar's. The dapper summer look is done to near perfection. Ali came really close to looking like a maître d at a French restaurant with his white summer jacket with black lapels, but the shirt saves it, never mind the satin. His pants would have been ridiculous had they not been folded at the ankles. The shoes are what hipster chic happy endings are made of. | Мода Полицијата: Што Игра на тронови поврати<br/><br/>Канадско-францускиот пејач Абас Хасан стави заслепувачки напор да го надмине целото човештво на Модната парада 2014.

Исто така, Асоцијацијата на сите тетки во Пакистан официјално поднесе жалба против него. Локалниот пазар се исуши од лажни кристали и секирирани чудовишта. Тие немаат што да носат за своите двонеделни високи чаеви и тврдат дека тој е виновен. Очигледно, облеката е инспирирана од Игра на тронови. Може ли да ве молам да се држи до компонирање тажни песни за мртвото куче на неговиот сосед, наместо да концептуализира облека?

Тој во моментов е во притвор и се обидува да се одмазди со облекување на облека од други фантазиски шоуа. Тој само се залепи за да изгледа како Едвард Кален од Самрак. Како порака за јавна служба и за да спречиме понатамошни нервни скршеници, му ги дадовме следниве примери на мажи од црвениот тепих на истиот настан.<br/><br/>Зохаиб Хасан<br/><br/>Кога се сомневате, играјте безбедно. Пејачот изгледа како вашиот просечен вујко во shaadi. Обичен црн костум без додатоци, дури и ако е малку непропорционален, е изводлив. Изгледот на Zohaib е измешан во сè и ништо, а кога немате смисла за мода или пари за да вработите стилист, ова е во ред. Тоа не носи ризик од срцев удар за колегите присутни на настан. Со оглед на деликатната ментална состојба на Абас, овој поглед треба да биде целта, секогаш и засекогаш.<br/><br/>Али Зафар<br/><br/>Еден ден, по децении на терапија, Абас би можел да се обиде да носи облека како Али Зафар. Али беше многу блиску до тоа да изгледа како мајстор Д во француски ресторан со неговата бела летна јакна со црни ревери, но кошулата го зачувува, а не сатенот. Неговите панталони ќе беа смешни ако не беа преклопени на глуждовите. Чевлите се она од што се направени хипстерските среќни завршетоци. |
| Determining soil hydraulic properties with different wetting liquids : A thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the Degree of Master of Science at Lincoln University<br/><br/>Abstract<br/><br/>Soil hydraulic properties such as hydraulic conductivity, water retention and plant water relationships dominate the water movement processes. For example, the infiltration, evaporation and water flow within the soil. As a widespread phenomenon in soil, soil water repellency alters the soil hydraulic functions by resisting the water flow into the soils. Moreover, the hydraulic properties not only depend on the pore system of soil but also are affected by the physicochemical properties of the pore surfaces. Compared to water, ethanol is not affected by the water repellency due to its lower surface tension. The purpose of using ethanol is to eliminate the effect of soil water repellency on hydraulic properties measurements. However, applying pure ethanol into natural soil can degrade the soil organic materials and lead to changes in physical properties. Therefore, the aqueous ethanol solutions can be an alternative option. Nevertheless, the feasibility of using aqueous ethanol for determining soil liquid retention curve remains unknown. This study aims to test the feasibility of the aqueous ethanol solutions (0, 10 %, 20 %, 30 %, 40 %, 50 % and 100 % v/v) for establishing liquid retention curve under a small range of applied pressure in coarse sand samples with different wettability and organic amended natural soil (Templeton silt loam (TSL) with mushroom compost, biochar, dairy effluent, and municipal compost, the application rate was 15 % by weight). The result showed that the desorption of testing aqueous ethanol solutions compared to water was quicker by approximately 1 to 3x based on the liquid content at the same applied pressure and the time for reaching each equilibrium. The outcomes from the sand experiment suggested that when the concentration of aqueous ethanol solution was below 50 %, the losses via evaporation were less than 1% and the relative differences between testing liquid and water was lower than 10 %. However, the evaporation losses were 11.06 % and 24.6 %, and the relative differences were all around 15 % and 30 % in 50 % and 100 % ethanol solution, respectively. In contrast, the organic amendments in Templeton silt loam not only increased the water retention capability but also reduced the evaporation losses. The evaporation losses in TSL soil and TSL with organic amendments soil were with 1 % in solutions with less than 50 % ethanol content. Evaporation losses of 50 % and 100 % ethanol were 2.8 % and 2.9 %, respectively. The relative differences between water and testing liquid were similar to the sand experiment when the testing liquid concentrations were below 50 %. However, the relative differences in 50 % and 100 % ethanol solution were smaller than in the sand sample with around 10 % and 15%, respectively. Additionally, the analysis of relative difference suggested that almost all aqueous ethanol solutions had lower volumetric liquid content at the same supplied pressure compared to water, which was a reflection of the aqueous ethanol solutions desorbed faster than water under equivalent pressure. Therefore, 10 % to 40 % of ethanol solutions could be considered an alternative for determining soil hydraulic properties due to their faster desorption rate and not being affected by soil water repellency. Due to the evaporation and dissolution of organic material, aqueous ethanol solutions above 50% concentration were not suitable for coarse sand or medium-textured soil.... [Show full abstract] | Определување на почвата хидраулични својства со различни течности за навлажнување : Теза поднесена во делумно исполнување на барањата за Магистер на науки на Универзитетот Линколн<br/><br/>Апстракт<br/><br/>Хидрауличните својства на почвата, како што се хидраулична спроводливост, задржување на вода и односи со растенијата, доминираат во процесите на движење на водата. На пример, инфилтрацијата, испарувањето и протокот на вода во почвата. Како широко распространет феномен во почвата, отпорноста на почвената вода ги менува хидрауличните функции на почвата со тоа што се спротивставува на протокот на вода во почвата. Покрај тоа, хидрауличните својства не само што зависат од порениот систем на почвата, туку исто така се под влијание на физичко-хемиските својства на порените површини. Во споредба со водата, етанолот не е под влијание на водоотпорноста поради пониската површинска напнатост. Целта на употребата на етанол е да се елиминира ефектот на отпорноста на почвената вода на мерењата на хидраулични својства. Сепак, примената на чист етанол во природна почва може да ги деградира органските материјали на почвата и да доведе до промени во физичките својства. Затоа, водените раствори на етанол може да бидат алтернатива. Сепак, изводливоста на користење на водениот етанол за одредување на крива на задржување на течности во почвата останува непозната. Оваа студија има за цел да ја тестира изводливоста на водените раствори на етанол (0, 10 %, 20 %, 30 %, 40 %, 50 % и 100 % v/v) за воспоставување на крива на задржување на течности под мал опсег на применет притисок во примероци од груб песок со различна влажност и органски модифицирана природна почва (Templeton mult il (TSL) со стапост, био-тот, био-тек). Резултатот покажа дека десорпцијата на тестирање на водени раствори на етанол во споредба со вода била побрза за приближно 1 до 3x врз основа на содржината на течноста при истиот применет притисок и времето за постигнување на секоја рамнотежа. Резултатите од експериментот со песок сугерираат дека кога концентрацијата на водениот раствор на етанол е под 50%, загубите од испарувањето биле помали од 1%, а релативните разлики помеѓу тестирањето на течноста и водата биле помали од 10%. Сепак, загубите на испарување биле 11,06% и 24,6%, а релативните разлики биле околу 15% и 30% во 50% и 100% раствор на етанол, соодветно. Спротивно на тоа, органските измени во калта на Темплтон не само што ја зголемија способноста за задржување на вода, туку и ги намалија загубите од испарување. Губитоците од испарување во TSL почвата и TSL почвата со органски модификации беа со 1% во раствори со помалку од 50% содржина на етанол. Губитоците од испарување од 50% и 100% етанол беа 2,8% и 2,9%, соодветно. Релативните разлики помеѓу водата и тестираната течност биле слични на експериментот со песок кога концентрациите на тестираната течност биле под 50%. Сепак, релативните разлики во 50% и 100% раствор на етанол биле помали отколку во песокот со околу 10% и 15%, соодветно. Покрај тоа, анализата на релативната разлика сугерирала дека речиси сите водени раствори на етанол имале пониска волуметриска содржина на течност при истиот снабден притисок во споредба со водата, што било одраз на водените раствори на етанол десорбирани побрзо од водата под еквивалентен притисок. Затоа, 10% до 40% од растворите на етанол може да се сметаат за алтернатива за одредување на хидрауличните својства на почвата поради нивната побрза стапка на десорпција и не се засегнати од отпорноста на почвената вода. Поради испарувањето и растворањето на органскиот материјал, водените раствори на етанол над 50% концентрација не беа погодни за груб песок или средно текстурирана почва. |

| Want to plant tomatoes in June or July along the Southern California Coast but not sure the seasonal timing is right? Most tomatoes, peppers and eggplants, for example, require around 100 days to harvest, therefore you'd want to transplant those into the ground around September 3. The state of California is so large that some of its areas are divided into multiple U.S. Department of Agriculture plant hardiness zones. Otherwise, you will want to plant tomatoes in the spring, as a crop that matures in late summer to early fall. There is a multitude of varieties, filling out the entire spectrum of color, size, and flavor. Anyway, it's important to remember that the numbers in this fall planting guide are only a starting point for you! But with all the weather weirdness happening in Southern California right now, one has to wonder if it's safe to start tomatoes this month as opposed to early spring. Before planting tomatoes, amend the soil with a mushroom compost or mycorrhizal fertilizer. From seed or transplant, follow these steps for successful tomatoes this season. ZONE 7. Look at this load of tomato beauties! by Farmers' Almanac Staff Updated: November 20, 2020 Home & Garden, Planting Guides. It takes a lot of water (and heating energy) to peel three million pounds of processing toma toes in California each year. California, that time changes if planting that vegetable in northern California. The days are bright and warm enough, and if you're starting tomatoes from seed, you can get a jump-start on the season by planting earlier and harvesting earlier. These problems that plague tomatoes grown in containers can magnify in tropical or subtropical climates, where the humidity is turned up and pests multiply. If you are in Zone 10 (parts of Hawaii, southern California and southern Florida), you can plant tomatoes late as a fall crop. All of the following pertains to full-size tomatoes. Oregon's Rogue River Valley, California's High Foothills Growing season: May to early Oct. Summers are hot and dry; typical winter lows run from 23 degrees to 9 degrees F/-5 degrees to -13 degrees C. The summer-winter contrast suits plants that need dry, hot summers and moist, only moderately cold winters. In the U.S. we ripen them by putting them in a sunny east or west window. Tomatoes can be found in nearly every vegetable garden across the country, and with good reason, as little else compares to the flavor of a home-grown tomato. Remove tomato plant from the nursery pot (even if it is a peat pot).
