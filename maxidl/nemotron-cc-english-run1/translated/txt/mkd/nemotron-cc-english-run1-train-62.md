| Abstract<br/><br/>There are an estimated 3.5 million mosques worldwide. The relatively large surface area of most mosque rooftops and their ubiquity in the Muslim world make them excellent candidates for solar photovoltaic (PV) installations. Muslims congregate for prayers at mosques five times a day: at dawn, noon, afternoon, sunset, and evening. Because these times are governed by the sun, they change chronographically within the year, according to the season, but are perpetual. As such, mosque electricity load profiles are highly predictable across each year and experience limited annual variation.<br/><br/>Authors<br/><br/>Amro Elshurafa<br/><br/>Research FellowAmro is a research fellow with 15 years of research experience on three continents in the fields of technology and energy.

| Why are Explosion Proof Lights Different?<br/>(4/22/2010) When the conditions are right in any of these settings, the only thing keeping the unthinkable from happening is the lack of an ignition source. In an atmosphere that has become contaminated with volatile gases, or heavily saturated with combustible dust, all it takes is one tiny spark to set in motion a chain of reactions that can lead to fires, explosions, and injuries.<br/><br/>In many of these settings, it is in fact common for a flammable atmosphere to be present, and there is no practical way to completely avoid producing these conditions. Because these conditions are often created as a part of the normal operations of industry and cannot be totally negated, the next obvious solution is to remove all possible sources of ignition. Doing this is easier said than done, since in industry there are so many sources that must be considered. Everything from light switches to fans are possible sources of ignition, and they simply cannot be entirely removed the workspace. It's because of this that specialized versions of equipment that must be operated in these hazardous environments have been developed and are mandated for use in hazardous locations by OSHA.<br/><br/>Equipment for use in hazardous locations has several ratings and categories that indicate the suitability of the equipment for use depending upon the level of danger a particular location may create. For the control of ignition sources, most regulations deal in mandating either intrinsically safe electrical equipment, or explosion proof equipment. The differences between the two are subtle, but important. Intrinsically safe equipment is basically any equipment that is incapable of producing sufficient energy to cause ignition. Explosion proof refers to equipment that can contain and isolate possible sources of ignition, preventing them from making contact with the open air. It would seem obvious that intrinsically safe would be the highest safety rating, and in fact it is. Intrinsically safe rated equipment is suitable for use in all the hazardous location groups and ratings as defined by OSHA regulations. Despite this, intrinsically safe equipment is not always the best choice because of the limitations created by its higher costs and generally low power characteristics.<br/><br/>Explosion proof equipment on the other hand is not as constrained by the limitations imposed by the intrinsically safe rating, and allows for a broader and more powerful spectrum of equipment to be used, and at cheaper cost. Since the explosion proof rating only requires that sources of ignition be contained, and temperatures be kept below certain levels for varying division ratings, the basic design of equipment can remain intact, with additional design incorporated to contain its normally open sources of possible ignition. A basic example would be a simple light switch. In normal conditions, a light switch has at its core a contact point where two metal conductors are put into contact with each other to form a closed circuit, thereby transferring electrical energy to the lamp.<br/><br/>It is at this contact point that a possible ignition source is created as the two conductors come into contact with each other and produce a small spark or arc. Isolating this spark can be as simple as encasing the entire switch within a sealed and non conductive exterior such as rubber, thereby removing the conductive portion of the switch from contact with the outside atmosphere.This is a greatly simplified example, but it demonstrates the basic premise. To better understand the full premise behind making electrical equipment explosion proof, and just how much is involved in the design, it is better to look at something a bit more complicated.<br/><br/>One of the first things you'll note is how different this drop light's appearance is from ordinary drop lights. While the overall shape and design appearance is the same, it is somewhat stouter and much more rugged looking. This is due to the necessity of incorporating a stronger basic body assembly. As well as sealing possible sources of ignition from contact with flammable dust or vapors, the assembly must be able to contain any ignition of gases within its housing; if a bulb were to explode, or gases to get inside and ignite, the housing is capable of containing these long enough for them to cool below ignition temperatures before they can escape. In a traditional drop light, there is no sealing, and the assembly is a great deal less rugged.<br/><br/>The next thing you would notice is that the lamp is constructed of non sparking materials. The body is made from high strength composites, the metal cage and lamp housing is aluminum, and the cord is chemical and abrasion resistant. This allows the lamp to be accidentally dropped, and greatly reduces the chances that an errant spark is created when it contacts the ground. Further enhancing the safety of the lamp is a clear impact resistant enclosure that seals the bulb itself from the outside environment. The bulb and the enclosure are both protected from impacts by a strong aluminum cage, reducing the chances of damages from impacts. Traditional drop lights have little to no concern for the metals used in construction aside from production cost, and rely on thin steel and tin for most of their metallic components.<br/><br/>In this particular lamp, LEDs are used instead of a typical incandescent or fluorescent bulb. These LEDs create less heat than traditional bulbs, and produce a greater amount of light with less power. As well as being more efficient, the LEDs are also a great deal more resistant to damage from dropping or impacts. Traditional bulbs rely on a fragile tungsten filament to produce light through resistance to electrical current. This fragile filament is easily broken by vibration or impacts. As well as being easily damaged, a traditional bulb relies on a gas filled enclosure surrounding the filament to increase the life of the filament. This glass enclosure is also easily broken, and represents an ignition hazard if it breaks during use and exposes the hot filament to an explosive atmosphere. With the LED bulb, there is no gas filled enclosure to break, and no heated filament to present an ignition source. This has the effect of further improving this lamps resistance to creating an errant ignition source.<br/><br/>Lastly, you'll note that all the parts of this assembly are tightly and securely sealed together. Unlike traditional lamps, all the seams and connections are sealed with gaskets and fillers that isolate the internal electronics of the unit from the outside. Contaminants are kept out, and possible ignitions are kept in, removing the possibility of a chance ignition of the volatile compounds that may be present.<br/><br/>As well as being ruggedly designed and explosion proof, this lamp is also very energy efficient. The LED bulb uses a fraction of the power a normal bulb consumes. At only 7 watts, this LED lamp produces the light equivalent of a standard 100 watt incandescent. The life of the LED is significantly longer as well, with the LED bulb rated at approximately 50,000 hours of life, while a traditional incandescent is typically rated well below 5000 hours. This means less trouble and expense with replacing the bulb. As well as consuming less energy, the LED bulb produces far less heat. In a standard drop light, none of the above features are present. It is commonly understood that frequent bulb replacements and occasional burns from contact with the hot housing assembly are a part of using the standard incandescent lamp. Not so with LEDs.<br/><br/>As you can see, there is a great deal of consideration and design that goes into creating a high quality piece of explosion proof equipment. Although the basic premise is still to produce a simple and efficient source of illumination, the added requirements of an explosion proof rating increases the demands for durability and ruggedness. In these lamps provided by Larson Electronics, those requirements are met and exceeded. | Зошто експлозивните светла се различни?<br/>Кога условите се точни во било која од овие поставувања, единственото нешто што го спречува незамисливото да се случи е недостатокот на извор на палење. Во атмосферата која е загадена со испарливи гасови или е силно заситена со запалива прашина, сè што е потребно е една мала искра за да се активира синџир на реакции кои можат да доведат до пожари, експлозии и повреди.<br/><br/>Во многу од овие поставувања, всушност, е вообичаено да биде присутна запалива атмосфера, и не постои практичен начин целосно да се избегне создавањето на овие услови. Бидејќи овие услови често се создаваат како дел од нормалното работење на индустријата и не можат целосно да се негираат, следното очигледно решение е да се отстранат сите можни извори на палење. Правејќи го ова е полесно да се каже отколку да се направи, бидејќи во индустријата има толку многу извори што мора да се земат предвид. Сè од прекинувачи за светлина до вентилатори се можни извори на палење, и тие едноставно не можат да бидат целосно отстранети од работниот простор. Поради ова се развиени специјализирани верзии на опрема која мора да работи во овие опасни средини и се задолжени за употреба на опасни локации од страна на OSHA.<br/><br/>Опремата за употреба на опасни локации има неколку рејтинги и категории кои укажуваат на соодветноста на опремата за употреба во зависност од нивото на опасност што одредена локација може да ја создаде. За контрола на извори на палење, повеќето прописи се занимаваат со задолжително или внатрешно безбедна електрична опрема, или опрема за заштита од експлозија. Разликите помеѓу двете се суптилни, но важни. Безбедна опрема е во основа секоја опрема која не е способна да произведе доволно енергија за да предизвика палење. Експлозија доказ се однесува на опрема која може да содржи и изолираат можни извори на палење, спречувајќи ги од контакт со отворен воздух. Се чини дека очигледно дека суштински безбедно ќе биде највисоката безбедност рејтинг, и всушност тоа е. Безбедната опрема е погодна за употреба во сите опасни локациски групи и рејтинги како што е дефинирано со прописите на OSHA. И покрај тоа, внатрешно безбедната опрема не е секогаш најдобриот избор поради ограничувањата создадени од повисоките трошоци и генерално ниските карактеристики на моќност.<br/><br/>Опремата за заштита од експлозија, од друга страна, не е толку ограничена од ограничувањата наметнати од внатрешната безбедна рејтинг, и овозможува да се користи поширок и помоќен спектар на опрема и по поевтина цена. Бидејќи оцената за експлозивност бара само да се содржат извори на палење, а температурите да се одржуваат под одредени нивоа за различни рејтинги на поделба, основниот дизајн на опремата може да остане непроменет, со дополнителен дизајн вграден за да ги содржи своите нормално отворени извори на можно палење. Основен пример би бил едноставен прекинувач на светлината. Во нормални услови, прекинувачот на светлината има во своето јадро точка на контакт каде што два метални проводници се ставаат во контакт едни со други за да формираат затворено коло, со што се пренесува електрична енергија на светилката.<br/><br/>Во оваа точка на контакт се создава можен извор на палење кога двата проводници доаѓаат во контакт едни со други и произведуваат мала искра или лак. Изолирањето на оваа искра може да биде едноставно како покривање на целиот прекинувач во затворена и непроводлива надворешност како што е гумата, со што се отстранува проводливиот дел од прекинувачот од контакт со надворешната атмосфера. Ова е многу поедноставен пример, но ја покажува основната премиса. За подобро да се разбере целосната премиса зад правење на електрична опрема експлозија доказ, и само колку е вклучен во дизајнот, подобро е да се погледне во нешто малку посложено.<br/><br/>Една од првите работи што ќе забележите е колку е различен изгледот на оваа капка светлина е од обичните капка светла. Додека целокупната форма и дизајн изглед е ист, тоа е малку поцврста и многу повеќе цврст изглед. Ова се должи на потребата за вградување на посилен основен склоп на телото. Како и запечатување на можни извори на палење од контакт со запалива прашина или пареа, склопот мора да биде во можност да го содржат секое палење на гасови во неговото живеалиште; ако сијалицата експлодира, или гасови да влезат внатре и да се запалат, куќиштето е способно да ги содржи доволно долго за да се олади под температурите на палење пред да можат да избегаат. Во традиционалната капка светлина, нема заптивка, а собранието е многу помалку цврсто.<br/><br/>Следното нешто што ќе забележите е дека светилката е изградена од материјали кои не блескаат. Телото е направено од композити со висока цврстина, металниот кафез и куќиштето на светилката е алуминиум, а кабелот е хемиски и отпорен на абење. Ова им овозможува на светилката да биде случајно испуштена и во голема мера ги намалува шансите за создавање на лута искра кога ќе допре до земјата. Понатамошно подобрување на безбедноста на светилката е јасно куќиште отпорно на удар што ја запечатува самата сијалица од надворешната средина. И сијалицата и куќиштето се заштитени од удари со силен алуминиумски кафез, намалувајќи ги шансите за оштетување од удари. Традиционалните паѓачки светла имаат малку или никаква грижа за металите кои се користат во градежништвото, освен трошоците за производство, и се потпираат на тенок челик и калај за повеќето од нивните метални компоненти.<br/><br/>Во оваа лампа, LED диоди се користат наместо типичен жар или флуоресцентна сијалица. Овие LED диоди создаваат помалку топлина од традиционалните сијалици, и произведуваат поголема количина на светлина со помала моќност. Како и да биде поефикасен, LED диоди, исто така, се многу повеќе отпорни на оштетување од падот или удари. Традиционалните сијалици се потпираат на кршлив волфрам филамент за производство на светлина преку отпорност на електрична струја. Овој кршлив филамент лесно се крши со вибрации или удари. Освен што лесно се оштетува, традиционалната сијалица се потпира на исполнета со гас куќиште кое го опкружува филаментот за да го зголеми животот на филаментот. Ова стаклено куќиште, исто така, лесно се крши и претставува опасност од палење ако се скрши за време на употребата и го изложи топлото влакно на експлозивна атмосфера. Со LED сијалица, не постои гас исполнет куќиште да се скрши, и нема загреан филамент да се претстави извор на палење. Ова има ефект на понатамошно подобрување на овој светилки отпорност на создавање на грешни извор на палење.<br/><br/>Конечно, ќе забележите дека сите делови од ова собрание се цврсто и безбедно запечатени заедно. За разлика од традиционалните светилки, сите споеви и врски се запечатени со заптивки и полнила кои ја изолираат внатрешната електроника на единицата од надвор. Загадувачите се чуваат надвор, а можните запалувања се чуваат внатре, отстранувајќи ја можноста за случајно палење на испарливи соединенија кои можат да бидат присутни.<br/><br/>Покрај тоа што е цврсто дизајниран и експлозија доказ, оваа светилка е исто така многу енергетски ефикасен. LED сијалица користи дел од моќта на нормална сијалица троши. Со само 7 вати, оваа LED светилка произведува светлосен еквивалент на стандардна 100-ватна сијалица. Животниот век на LED е значително подолг, како и, со LED сијалица оценето на околу 50,000 часа на живот, додека традиционалната жарница обично се оценува многу под 5000 часа. Ова значи помалку проблеми и трошоци со замена на сијалицата. Освен што троши помалку енергија, LED сијалицата произведува далеку помалку топлина. Во стандардна капка светлина, ниту една од горенаведените карактеристики не се присутни. Вообичаено се разбира дека чести замена сијалица и повремени изгореници од контакт со топла домување собрание се дел од користењето на стандардната светилка со жарење. Не е така со LED диоди.<br/><br/>Како што можете да видите, постои многу размислување и дизајн кој оди во создавање на висококвалитетно парче опрема за заштита од експлозија. Иако основната претпоставка е сеуште да се произведе едноставен и ефикасен извор на осветлување, додадените барања на експлозијата-доказ рејтингот ги зголемува барањата за издржливост и цврстина. Во овие светилки обезбедени од Larson Electronics, овие барања се исполнети и надминати. |
| Some photographers think a cloudy day yields better light than a sunny. It's true that sunny light can be a little difficult to contain but if you can harness it well, the results can be spectacular. This shoot occurred on a pretty dreary day but the light did yield some beautifully soft light that gave some of the objects a rich, buttery feel to them. | Некои фотографи мислат дека облачниот ден дава подобра светлина од сончевиот. Точно е дека сончевата светлина може да биде малку тешка за задржување, но ако можете да ја искористите добро, резултатите можат да бидат спектакуларни. Ова снимање се случило на прилично здодевен ден, но светлината дала убаво мека светлина која им дала на некои од предметите богато, путерско чувство. |
