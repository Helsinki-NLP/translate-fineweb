| Political Selling 101<br/><br/>Written by Dave Stein<br/><br/>Note: To see charts in this article, view it on  Most people who have been selling for even a short period of time understand that some level of corporate politics is present in every organization into which they sell. As sales professionals' experience and political savvy increases, so does what they observe in their accounts. If you aren't aware of political activity in your accounts, it doesn't mean that it isn't there. It just means you can't see it and certainly can't leverage it. If your competitor is politically savvy, you are at a distinct disadvantage. What is politics? According to Merriam-Webster one definition is, "competition between competing interest groups or individuals for power and leadership." Winners have developed a set of skills that enables them to consistently succeed because of, or in spite of, politics. They've learned to select right competing interest groups and then ride power and leadership wave to success by devising and executing political strategies for each key influencer and decision maker. Being adept politically will rarely lead to a win by itself. There are many other components to winning. But to not understand and take advantage of interpersonal forces within an account is to leave assets unleveraged. Here are some of key skills required to elevate yourself into realm of political selling: Skill: A basic understanding of how corporate politics works. For our purposes, politics and influence are synonymous. People need help of other people to achieve certain business goals (i.e. my department's project gets funded) as well as business-driven personal goals (i.e. if it is successful, I get a raise--I can afford that new house). Within a company, it works something like this: "If you report to me I can just tell you to do something and you will do it." That's SAY-SO influence. You'll do it because I say so. But if you don't work for me--let's say you work in another department--it becomes more difficult. I then have to influence you to help me. I'll use POLITICAL influence. That requires a combination of skills and artistry and it takes time and strategy. Here is an example: Let's say that we both work for same company, but for different departments. If I need your help for my department to achieve its quarterly objectives, I might look for ways in which I can help you achieve your objectives (ideally, business and personal objectives) and subtly advertise those to you as benefits of helping me. In that way we are aligned with a set of common interdependent purposes. Win-win. When you are selling into a company, you have absolutely no SAY-SO over buyer. You can't tell anyone in your customer's company what to do. You can only influence them to give you information, insights, coaching and preference so that they influence others to look at you and your offering favorably. The best way to influence someone is to clearly communicate how and by how much you will contribute to advancement of their business and (business-related) personal goals. In diagram below, you'll see that when you can help a buyer or influencer meet their personal and business goals (Quadrant 1), you're much more likely to gain commitment from them in helping you win. In Quadrant 2, there is no personal win, so their commitment, although altruistic so far as a contribution to their company, will not be supported as strongly. Stay away from people in Quadrant 3. In those cases, person you are selling to is "in it for themselves," acting counter to what is in best interests of their company. You run risk of not only losing deal, but being associated with "dirty politics," which could affect your personal and your company's reputation. Quadrant 4 reminds you that if you find you can't contribute to person achieving their business or personal goals, your likelihood of gaining their support is minimal. Don't turn these people into enemies, but focus your efforts on finding and selling to influencers in first quadrant. Skill: The ability to see what's invisible As I suggested earlier, not everyone is skilled enough to observe sophisticated corporate politicians being influential. Savvy politicians do their thing privately. It's not unlike backroom deals done by government politicians. How do you know that there is influence being wielded? First, assume it is. Then begin to look at results and work backward. We can extract a good example from everyday government politics: If there is "pork"--say $650.3 million in corporate tax benefits for igloo manufacturers in Alaska--embedded in a House of Representatives education bill, you can quickly figure out who lent a hand getting it through committee. Ask your contacts within your customer's company or government department about prior purchases, projects and initiatives. Find out who sponsored them, whose budgets paid for them, who were ultimate decision makers and who benefited in some more personal ways. The names you come up with will likely be people of influence, either through their command of an organization, or through astute politicking. They are ones for whose influence you will be positioning during your sales campaign. Skill: Connecting dots You've done some discovery and have begun to make associations. When you asked about recent projects, several people referenced Carrie Miehome, who works in IT organization. She deftly led steering committee with CRM project last year. Funny thing though, that project was put ahead of others that already had funding. Why would that be, you might ask? Who benefits from a CRM implementation? The VP of Sales? The VP of Customer Service? Perhaps CFO who wants more visibility into revenue stream... It's perfectly reasonable to expect that she was influenced by a higher power. The challenge will be finding out whom, what was in it for them and what was in it for her if you are selling IT solutions to that company. Skill: Knowing how to map out organization You'll need to start with an organization chart. If they won't give you one, you can build one by getting answers to pointed questions about reporting structure, by reading information on web and, if your customer is a public company, from corporate SEC filings.<br/><br/>Why Write a Sales Letter for Each Product?<br/><br/>Authors/publishers are great at getting their books written. Entrepreneurs know their products. But after initial one-year honeymoon, sales slow down. To counter this make sure your ebook, product, or service you offer will keep on selling from first day, first year, even for life. Write a short sales letter for each product or ebook.<br/><br/>Whether you have a Web site or not, you can write a first class, must-buy-now sales letter. Write one for each teleclass, eBook, product, or service. I even write one for my bookcoaching services.<br/><br/>If you are like me and have a Web site, it is content driven. Why? Because that's why people come to any site--to get free information. You must also give them a reason to buy. Most home pages say too much about author or book instead of intriguing their potential buyers with a benefit- driven headline, which in turns leads them to benefits of their books--the sales letter.<br/><br/>My first Web site had many fine books and kits in personal growth and book writing and marketing. Sales never went over $200 a month. To correct that, I created a new site and paid special attention to its sales language (without hype) for each teleclass, eBook, and book coaching opportunities to suit each income and need. Sales were $75 first month, and in four months they reached $2265. The next year they went around $3000 a month.<br/><br/>What Every Sales Letter Needs to Pull Orders and Profits<br/><br/>You can write each sales letter in less than four hours first time. As you practice, you can write them in two hours.<br/><br/>1. Start Letter with a Benefit-Driven Headline.<br/><br/>Include these headlines throughout your sales letter. "Want a quick and easy way to quadruple your Online Income in Four Months?<br/><br/>If you answered, "yes" to yourself, headline succeeds, because you will keep reading. If you said "No, I don't believe this, " but I'm curious where this is going," headline still succeeds. You win when your headline seduces your potential customer to read on in your sales letter to discover your product[']s benefits and features, some fine testimonials, and finally to click "buy now" which takes them to order page.<br/><br/>2. List Top Five Benefits of your Product or Service in bullet form.<br/><br/>To define your top benefits start with a list of problems your client or customer wants solutions for. Each specific problem you answer can be labeled a benefit. If you are not rock sure of who your audience is, your sales copy dribbles away and doesn't meet its target. Keep redefining your audience and know as much about them as you can.<br/><br/>Remember that one benefit is top undeniable benefit—usually more money easier, more clients faster, more profits from Web sales, better relationships, and health.<br/><br/>If you have more than five benefits collected in a list, sprinkle rest throughout your copy. How will your book make someone's life easier, richer in time or money, help their personal growth, provide additional income, entertain them? How will your product or service make them a better business person, more attractive, feel better, avoid catastrophe, sickness, or surgery?<br/><br/>3. Address your Potential Buyer's Resistances.<br/><br/>Remember to tell a background story of where they are NOW so they will emotionally connect with your solutions (the product or service). Let's say they want to write an eBook or print book to make themselves "expert," make life-long passive income, or share their unique message. | Политичка продажба 101<br/><br/>Напишано од Дејв Стајн<br/><br/>Забелешка: За да ги видите графиконите во оваа статија, погледнете го на Повеќето луѓе кои продаваат дури и за краток временски период разбираат дека одредено ниво на корпоративна политика е присутно во секоја организација во која продаваат. Како што се зголемува искуството на продавачите и политичката паметност, така се зголемува и она што го забележуваат во нивните сметки. Ако не сте свесни за политичката активност на вашите сметки, тоа не значи дека не е таму. Тоа само значи дека не можете да го видите и сигурно не можете да го искористите. Ако вашиот конкурент е политички паметен, вие сте во јасна неповолна положба. Што е политика? Според Мериам-Вебстер, една дефиниција е „конкуренција помеѓу конкурентски интересни групи или поединци за моќ и лидерство“. Победниците развиле збир на вештини кои им овозможуваат постојано да успеат поради, или и покрај, политиката. Тие научиле да ги изберат вистинските конкурентни интересни групи, а потоа да возат бран на моќ и лидерство до успех со осмислување и спроведување на политички стратегии за секој клучен влијател и носител на одлуки. Да се биде политички вешт ретко ќе доведе до победа сама по себе. Постојат многу други компоненти за победа. Но, да не се разбере и да ги искористат предностите на интерперсоналните сили во рамките на сметката е да се напуштат средствата неискористени. Еве некои од клучните вештини потребни за да се издигнете во областа на политичката продажба: Вештина: Основно разбирање на тоа како функционира корпоративната политика. За нашите цели, политиката и влијанието се синоними. На луѓето им е потребна помош од други луѓе за да постигнат одредени деловни цели (т.е. проектот на мојот оддел се финансира), како и лични цели управувани од бизнисот (т.е. ако е успешен, добивам зголемување - можам да си дозволам таа нова куќа). Во рамките на една компанија, работи нешто вака: "Ако ми се јавите, можам само да ви кажам да направите нешто и ќе го направите тоа." Тоа е КАЖИ-ТОА влијание. Ќе го направите тоа затоа што јас велам така. Но, ако не работите за мене - да речеме дека работите во друг оддел - станува потешко. Тогаш морам да влијаам на вас за да ми помогнете. Ќе го користам ПОЛИТИЧКОТО влијание. Тоа бара комбинација на вештини и уметност и бара време и стратегија. Еве еден пример: Да речеме дека и двајцата работиме за истата компанија, но за различни оддели. Ако ми треба вашата помош за мојот оддел да ги постигне своите квартални цели, би можел да побарам начини на кои можам да ви помогнам да ги постигнете вашите цели (идеално, деловни и лични цели) и суптилно да ги рекламирате за вас како придобивки од помагањето. На тој начин ние сме усогласени со збир на заеднички меѓусебно зависни цели. Win-win. Кога продавате во компанија, немате апсолутно КАЖИ-SO над купувачот. Не можете да му кажете на никого во компанијата на вашиот клиент што да прави. Можете да влијаете на нив само за да ви дадат информации, увиди, тренинг и преференции, така што тие влијаат на другите да гледаат на вас и вашата понуда поволно. Најдобар начин да влијаете на некого е јасно да комуницирате како и со колку ќе придонесете за унапредување на нивниот бизнис и (бизнис-поврзани) лични цели. Во дијаграмот подолу, ќе видите дека кога можете да му помогнете на купувачот или влијателниот да ги исполни своите лични и деловни цели (квадрат 1), многу е поголема веројатноста да добиете посветеност од нив во помагањето да победите. Во Квадрант 2 нема лична победа, па нивната посветеност, иако алтруистична колку што е придонесот за нивната компанија, нема да биде поддржана толку силно. Останете подалеку од луѓето во Квадрант 3. Во тие случаи, лицето на кое продавате е "во него за себе", дејствува спротивно на она што е во најдобар интерес на нивната компанија. Ризикувате не само да го изгубите договорот, туку и да бидете поврзани со „валкана политика“, што може да влијае на вашата лична и на репутацијата на вашата компанија. Квадрант 4 ве потсетува дека ако откриете дека не можете да придонесете за постигнување на нивните деловни или лични цели, вашата веројатност за добивање на нивната поддршка е минимална. Не ги претворајте овие луѓе во непријатели, туку фокусирајте ги вашите напори на наоѓање и продажба на инфлуенсерите во првиот квадрант. Вештина: Способноста да се види она што е невидливо Како што сугерирав порано, не секој е доволно вешт да ги набљудува софистицираните корпоративни политичари како влијателни. Тоа не е за разлика од позадината договори направени од страна на владините политичари. Како да знаете дека има влијание се користи? Прво, претпоставете дека е. Потоа почнете да се погледне во резултатите и да работат наназад. Можеме да извлечеме добар пример од секојдневната владина политика: Ако има „свинско месо“ - да речеме 650,3 милиони долари во даночни олеснувања за производителите на иглу во Аљаска - вградени во законот за образование во Претставничкиот дом, можете брзо да дознаете кој помогнал да се добие преку комитетот. Прашајте ги вашите контакти во рамките на компанијата или владиниот оддел на вашиот клиент за претходните набавки, проекти и иницијативи. Дознајте кој ги спонзорирал, чии буџети ги плаќале, кои биле крајните носители на одлуки и кои имале корист на некои повеќе лични начини. Имињата што ќе ги смислите најверојатно ќе бидат луѓе со влијание, или преку нивната команда на организацијата, или преку проникливо политичарство. Тие се оние за чие влијание ќе се позиционирате за време на вашата продажна кампања. Вештина: Поврзување на точки Направивте некои откритија и почнавте да создавате асоцијации. Кога прашавте за неодамнешни проекти, неколку луѓе се повикуваа на Кери Михом, која работи во ИТ организацијата. Таа вешто го предводеше управувачкиот комитет со CRM проект минатата година. Смешно е што тој проект беше ставен пред другите кои веќе имаа финансирање. Зошто тоа би било, можеби ќе прашате? Кој има корист од имплементацијата на CRM? Потпретседателот на продажбата? Потпретседателот на службата за клиенти? Можеби финансиски директор кој сака поголема видливост во протокот на приходи... Сосема е разумно да се очекува дека таа била под влијание на повисока моќ. Предизвикот ќе биде да дознаете кој, што беше во него за нив и што беше во него за неа ако продавате ИТ решенија на таа компанија. Вештина: Знаење како да ја мапирате организацијата Ќе треба да започнете со организациска табела. Ако тие не сакаат да ви дадат еден, можете да изградите еден со добивање на одговори на истакнати прашања за структурата на известување, со читање на информации на интернет и, ако вашиот клиент е јавна компанија, од корпоративните SEC поднесоци.<br/><br/>Зошто да напишете писмо за продажба за секој производ?<br/><br/>Авторите / издавачите се одлични во пишувањето на своите книги. Претприемачите ги знаат своите производи. Но, по првичниот едногодишен меден месец, продажбата се забавува. За да се спротивставите на ова, бидете сигурни дека вашата е-книга, производ или услуга што ја нудите ќе продолжи да продава од првиот ден, првата година, дури и за живот. Напишете кратко писмо за продажба за секој производ или е-книга.<br/><br/>Без разлика дали имате веб-страница или не, можете да напишете прва класа, мора да купите продажно писмо сега. Напишете еден за секоја телекласа, е-книга, производ или услуга. Јас дури и пишувам еден за моите услуги за обука на книги.<br/><br/>Ако сте како мене и имаат веб-сајт, тоа е содржина управувано. Зошто? Затоа што тоа е причината зошто луѓето доаѓаат на било која страница - за да добијат бесплатни информации. Вие исто така мора да им даде причина да купат. Повеќето домашни страници кажуваат премногу за авторот или книгата, наместо да ги заинтригираат своите потенцијални купувачи со наслов кој ги управува со придобивки, што ги води до придобивките од нивните книги - продажбата на писмото.<br/><br/>Мојата прва веб-страница имаше многу фини книги и комплети за личен раст и пишување и маркетинг на книги. Продажбата никогаш не отиде над $ 200 месечно. За да го поправам тоа, создадов нова страница и посветив посебно внимание на нејзиниот јазик на продажба (без возбуда) за секоја телекласа, е-книга и можности за обука на книги за да одговараат на секој приход и потреба. Продажбата беше $ 75 во првиот месец, а за четири месеци достигнаа $ 2265. Следната година тие заработувале околу 3.000 долари месечно.<br/><br/>Она што секоја продажба писмо треба да се повлече нарачки и профит<br/><br/>Можете да го напишете секое продажно писмо за помалку од четири часа за прв пат. Како што вежбате, можете да ги напишете за два часа.<br/><br/>1. Започнете писмо со наслов со корист.<br/><br/>Вклучете ги овие наслови низ вашето писмо за продажба. "Сакате брз и лесен начин да го удвоите вашиот Онлајн приход за четири месеци?<br/><br/>Ако одговоривте "да" на себе, насловот успева, бидејќи ќе продолжите да читате. Ако рековте "Не, не верувам во ова ", но љубопитен сум каде оди ова", насловот сепак успева. Победувате кога вашиот наслов го заведува вашиот потенцијален клиент да прочита во вашето писмо за продажба за да ги откриете придобивките и карактеристиките на вашиот производ, некои фини сведоштва и конечно да кликнете "Купи сега", што ги зема на страницата за нарачка.<br/><br/>2. Наведете ги првите пет придобивки од вашиот производ или услуга во форма на куршум.<br/><br/>За да ги дефинирате вашите врвни придобивки, започнете со листа на проблеми за кои вашиот клиент или клиент сака решенија. Секој специфичен проблем на кој ќе одговорите може да биде означен како корист. Ако не сте сигурни кој е вашата публика, вашата продажба копија дриблира далеку и не ја исполнува својата цел. Продолжете да ја редефинирате вашата публика и да знаете колку што можете повеќе за нив.<br/><br/>Запомнете дека една од придобивките е врвот неоспорна корист - обично повеќе пари полесно, повеќе клиенти побрзо, повеќе профит од продажбата на интернет, подобри врски и здравје.<br/><br/>Ако имате повеќе од пет бенефиции собрани во листата, посипете го одморот низ вашата копија. Како вашата книга ќе го направи нечиј живот полесен, побогат во време или пари, ќе им помогне на нивниот личен раст, ќе обезбеди дополнителен приход, ќе ги забавува? Како вашиот производ или услуга ќе ги направат подобра деловна личност, попривлечна, подобро да се чувствуваат, да избегнат катастрофа, болест или операција?<br/><br/>3. Адресирајте ги отпорите на вашиот потенцијален купувач.<br/><br/>Не заборавајте да кажете позадина приказна за тоа каде се СЕГА, така што тие ќе се поврзат емоционално со вашите решенија (производот или услугата). Да речеме дека сакаат да напишат е-книга или печатена книга за да станат „експерти“, да заработат доживотен пасивен приход или да ја споделат нивната единствена порака. |

We don't know how long it lasted but Lucifer was an angel who led a rebellion in heaven and started a war that affected the entire universe. The earth was his planet and he ruled from Eden, the same place where God would later put Adam and Eve. As Lucifer's last stand, the earth would have been damaged and looked much like Berlin did at the end of World War II. This would explain why the Bible speaks about a re-creation and God's call to replenish the earth. Adam and Eve were thrown into the conflict to prove that God is righteous to the angelic world. The rewards are potentially enormous: eternal life and being joint heirs with Jesus Christ.<br/><br/>If there was indeed a pre-Adamic civilization with commerce and war, then you shouldn't be surprised when a new world order emerges in the future that calls for peace and offers membership to anyone who will take an oath of loyalty and receive an identification mark that will give you access to the new financial system.

Ние веруваме, учат и практикуваат сите работи што Исус поучувал и биле практикувани од страна на Црквата во книгата Дела на апостолите. Исус ги повика своите ученици да бидат сол и светлина. Солта е конзерванс, но исто така е нешто што додава вкус и уживање на нашата секојдневна храна. Светлината е симбол на вистината; тоа е утешно, пенетрација, водич и разоткрива темнина. Ние се стремиме да ја зачуваме библиската вистина и да ја фрлиме славната светлина на Евангелието во свет кој е проголтан од темнината.<br/><br/>Погледнете го веб-кастот eaec.org/webcast.htm<br/><br/>ЗА ВИДЕОТО<br/><br/>Бог дал прогресивни откровенија низ целата Библија и токму со ова знаење можеме да заклучиме дека постоела креација пред Адам. Не знаеме колку долго траеше, но Луцифер беше ангел кој предводеше бунт на небото и започна војна која влијаеше на целиот универзум. Земјата беше неговата планета и тој владееше од Еден, истото место каде што Бог подоцна ќе го стави Адам и Ева. Како последниот став на Луцифер, земјата би била оштетена и изгледала многу како Берлин на крајот на Втората светска војна. Ова би објаснило зошто Библијата зборува за повторно создавање и Божјиот повик да ја надополни земјата. Адам и Ева биле фрлени во конфликтот за да докажат дека Бог е праведен за ангелскиот свет. Наградите се потенцијално огромни: вечен живот и да бидат заеднички наследници со Исус Христос.<br/><br/>Ако навистина постоела пред-адамска цивилизација со трговија и војна, тогаш не треба да бидете изненадени кога во иднина ќе се појави нов светски поредок кој повикува на мир и нуди членство на секој кој ќе положи заклетва на лојалност и ќе добие идентификациски знак кој ќе ви овозможи пристап до новиот финансиски систем.

Корените на еволуцијата со Пол Џејмс-Грифитс Дали теоријата на еволуцијата започнала со Чарлс Дарвин? Ако не, чие дело го градел, и од каде го добиле своето влијание? Пол Џејмс-Грифитс е поранешен професор по античка историја во овој говор го презентира своето истражување за потеклото на теоријата на еволуцијата, еден од најбезнадежните моменти од нејзиниот живот, Ерна де Врис се држи за оваа сламка на надеж: „да го види сонцето повторно“. Затвореник во озлогласениот „Блок на смртта 25“ на Аушвиц-Биркенау, 19-годишниот германски Евреин и нејзините колеги затвореници се на пат да бидат пушени со гас истото утро. Сепак, таа ја избегнува оваа сурова судбина. Таканаречениот „Мишлинг“ -- полу-Евреин -- таа е фатена од блокот на смртта и испратена во Равенсбрик со специјален транспорт за „Мишлинг“. Во Равенсбрук, женски концентрационен логор, Ерна де Врис е ставена на принудна работа за германската компанија Сименс.

| Post oak leaves have distinctive cross shape<br/><br/>So said the eminent Harvard botanist Asa Gray, on page 451 in his encyclopedic "Lessons in Botany and Vegetable Physiology," a book published in 1872.<br/><br/>I got my copy at an old bookstore several years ago. I can't remember where exactly. The book is some 700 pages long, not including a series of gorgeous line drawings of sedges, grasses and ferns in the back. The pages feature fore edge marbling…a bit faded now… and the front and back covers are ornamented, with the monogram of the publishing house. They don't make books like this anymore.<br/><br/>Professor Gray was, of course, referring to what we have as this week's Mystery Plant, the post oak, Quercus stellata. I'm pretty confident that all you botanists out there will recognize this instantly as some sort of oak.<br/><br/>Post oak leaves are bright green, and scratchy on the surfaces.(Photo: Keith Bradley)<br/><br/>Oaks belong to the genus Quercus…and they are not always large trees. Some species, of course, are called "scrub oaks", which seems to me a bit of a botanical "put-down", and other species are good examples of shrubs, not more than about knee-high.<br/><br/>Here in the Southeast, we have about 45 native oak species, most of which can rather easily be differentiated into two groups: "White oaks" (including our Mystery Plant) have rounded lobes, without any points or bristles on the tips.<br/><br/>"Red oaks" feature sharply pointed lobes, each with a prominent bristle at the top. There are some other differences, too.<br/><br/>Post oak is widely distributed in the eastern USA, from southern New England through Missouri and Texas, and then east from there, including northern Florida. It is a deciduous species, producing pale, somewhat shreddy or scaly bark. Really large, old individuals can be over 60 feet tall, and because of this, they make great shade trees along city streets and in parks.<br/><br/>The acorns take one season to mature, and they are a valuable wildlife food source. What most people remember about this species are the leaves. The leaves are bright green, and scratchy on the surfaces. Generally, the leaves have a distinctive cross-shaped ("cruciform") look, with two major lobes projected more or less horizontally from the midrib.<br/><br/>The cross-shape is not always well-developed from individual to individual, however, especially is there has been any hybridization going on. (Oak species are famous for mixing it up with each other.)<br/><br/>And this is interesting: Professor Gray refers to this oak in his book by using an incorrect name. The correct and first valid name came about in 1787, penned by a German botanist named Friedrich von Wangenheim. But for some reason, Gray printed the name Quercus obtusiloba, which had been proposed by the French botanist, Andre Michaux. But Michaux was 15 years late — je regrette.<br/><br/>John Nelson is the curator of the A. C.

Не се сеќавам каде точно. Книгата е долга околу 700 страници, не вклучувајќи серија прекрасни цртежи на линија на живци, треви и папрати во задниот дел. На страниците има мермерна мермерна мермерна мермерна мермерна мермерна мермерна мермерна мермерна мермерна мермерна мермерна мермерна мермерна мермерна мермерна мермерна мермерна мермерна мермерна мермерна мермерна мермерна мермерна мермерна мермерна мермерна мермерна мермерна мермерна мермерна мермерна мермерна мермерна мермерна мермерна мермерна мермерна мермерна мермерна мермерна мермерна мермерна мермерна мермерна мермерна мермерна мермерна мермер<br/><br/>Професор Греј, се разбира, мислеше на она што го имаме како мистериозната билка оваа недела, пост даб, Quercus stellata. Јас сум прилично сигурен дека сите вие ботаничари таму веднаш ќе го препознаете ова како некој вид даб.<br/><br/>Лисјата од даб се светло зелени и гребнати на површините. (Фото: Кит Бредли)<br/><br/>Дабовите припаѓаат на родот Quercus ... и тие не се секогаш големи дрвја. Некои видови, се разбира, се нарекуваат "дабови", што ми се чини дека е малку ботаничко "спуштање", а други видови се добри примери на грмушки, не повеќе од околу коленото.<br/><br/>Тука на југоистокот, имаме околу 45 домородни видови дабови, од кои повеќето можат прилично лесно да се диференцираат во две групи: "Белите дабови" (вклучувајќи ја и нашата мистериозна фабрика) имаат заоблени лобуси, без никакви точки или влакна на врвовите.<br/><br/>"Црвените дабови" имаат остро заострени лобуси, секој со истакната влакна на врвот. Постојат и некои други разлики, исто така.<br/><br/>Пост даб е широко распространет во источниот дел на САД, од јужна Нова Англија преку Мисури и Тексас, а потоа источно од таму, вклучувајќи ја и северната Флорида. Тоа е листопаден вид, кој произведува бледа, малку шредди или лушпаста кора. Навистина големи, стари поединци можат да бидат високи повеќе од 60 стапки, и поради ова, тие прават големи дрвја во сенка по улиците на градот и во парковите.<br/><br/>Жолтите земаат една сезона за да созреат, и тие се вреден извор на храна за дивиот свет. Она што повеќето луѓе се сеќаваат за овој вид се лисјата. Лисјата се светло зелени и гребнати на површините. Општо земено, листовите имаат карактеристичен изглед во облик на крст, со два големи лобуси проектирани повеќе или помалку хоризонтално од средишното ребро.<br/><br/>Вкрстената форма не е секогаш добро развиена од индивидуа до индивидуа, меѓутоа, особено ако имало некаква хибридизација. (Видовите дабови се познати по тоа што ги мешаат едни со други.)<br/><br/>И ова е интересно: Професор Греј се однесува на овој даб во својата книга со користење на погрешно име. Вистинското и првото валидно име дојде во 1787 година, напишано од германскиот ботаничар Фридрих фон Вангенхајм. Но, поради некоја причина, Греј го отпечатил името Quercus obtusiloba, кое го предложил францускиот ботаничар Андре Мишо. Но, Мишо задоцнил 15 години — жалам.<br/><br/>Џон Нелсон е куратор на А. Ц.
