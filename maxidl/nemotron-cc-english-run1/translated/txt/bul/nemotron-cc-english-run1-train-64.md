| Smith Chuck - Through the Bible C2000 SeriesShall we turn to the book of Acts, chapter one, as we begin our study of the early church.<br/>Luke, the author of the book of Acts, a companion of Paul the apostle, who was author also of the Gospel According to Luke, wrote these two treatises to a friend, Theophilus. Theophilus is a Greek name. It's a name that has a beautiful meaning. The name means lover of God. There are some who believe that it was not a man at all, but that the gospel and the book of Acts were addressed to the lovers of God, whoever you may be. There are other traditions that say that Theophilus was actually Luke's master. That in those days physicians were slaves, usually the slave of a wealthy patron. So that Luke's master was Theophilus, and he released Luke to be with Paul on the missionary journeys. Thus, Luke is writing back to his former master. This is an early tradition of the church, but it is, of course, impossible to prove, like so many of the traditions.<br/>There are also those who believe that when Paul was in Troas and he received a vision of a man calling unto him saying, "Come over to Macedonia and help us," that that man in Paul's vision was none other than Luke. For the first one that Paul really met when he came to Macedonia was Luke. And as we are in the book of Acts, you will find that when we get to that portion of the book of Acts, Luke begins to write more in the first person rather than the third person. So it is, evidently, at this particular point in the Acts of the Apostles that Luke became a companion of Paul and began to journey with him. He began to use the pronouns "we" and "us" instead of "they" and "them." This is, no doubt, where Luke became a participant and an eyewitness of those things that were happening from this point on. We will bring this out to you when we get to that point.<br/>He begins the Acts of the Apostles by tying it with the Gospel According to Luke. It is interesting that the very last thing that Luke records in his gospel is the very first thing he records in the Acts of the Apostles. We find the gospel of Luke closing as Jesus is telling His disciples to wait in Jerusalem until they be endued with power from on high. And then Jesus ascended up into heaven, and so he closes the gospel. In opening the Acts of the Apostles, he writes,<br/>The former treatise [that is, the Gospel According to Luke,] have I written unto you, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and teach ( Act 1:1 ),<br/>The key word is began. The Gospel According to Luke is not the full story of the ministry of Jesus Christ. It is only the beginning of the ministry of Jesus Christ. Jesus continues to minister to the needs of people. Jesus continues to heal the sick. Jesus continues to raise the dead. Jesus continues to minister His love and His gospel to the world, only now He is ministering through those disciples who have been anointed with His Holy Spirit. But the ministry of Christ is continuing; basically, is the premise that Luke takes in the Acts of the Apostles. The former treatise of all that Jesus began, both to do and to teach.<br/>Now because of that, the Acts of the Apostles is an unfinished book: in that the Lord today continues to work through the lives of those who have dedicated themselves to be the instruments of God. To be led and guided and anointed by His Holy Spirit, to continue the ministry of Jesus in the world today. Now God has ordained that His work should be accomplished through human instruments. I do not say that it must be accomplished. God can use angelic beings for His work, and there will come a time, during the book of Revelation when God will use angels to proclaim His gospel to people all over the world. Revelation, chapter 14, "The first angel flying through the midst of heaven having the everlasting gospel" ( Rev 14:6 ). But at the present time, God has chosen to use human instruments. As imperfect as they may be, yet that's what God has ordained to use. The exciting thing about that is, God will use me and God will use you. So many times, we're begging off, "O Lord, I can't speak. I've never been able to speak before or even now, Lord." As Moses tried to beg off the call of God. Jeremiah said, "Lord, I'm just a kid; no one's going to listen to me." And we all have our excuses why we can't be used. Don't we? We all know the reasons why God couldn't use us.<br/>One time, as the Lord was calling a prophet to do His work, he said, "Lord, send whoever you want." The Lord said, "Hey, I've called you." "Lord, good idea; send whoever you want." So often we're in that position, "Lord, send by the hand of whomsoever you will, anybody but me Lord." And yet, God has ordained to use us.<br/>Now, each of us can show our own imperfections. Each of us can point out our own inabilities, and all of us can find an excuse why God wouldn't want to use me. But yet, God has chosen to use you. That through your life He might reveal Himself to a needy world. You wonder when God has such instruments to use how He ever got the job done, don't you?<br/>Until the day in which he was taken up, after that he through the Holy Spirit had given commandments to the apostles whom he had chosen ( Act 1:2 ):<br/>That is what he ended the Gospel of Luke with. The day that Jesus was taken up, after He had told the apostles to wait for the endowment of power.<br/>To whom he also [that is the apostles he also] showed himself alive to them after his passion [or death] by many infallible proofs ( Act 1:3 ),<br/>It is difficult to deny the fact of the resurrection of Jesus Christ. I was amused, as well as annoyed and irritated, by an article I read in the Santa Ana Register this last Saturday. Of the creation science and evolutionary theories being presented in the county schools. How that, this one professor said that he teaches a science class, and thus, they deal only in facts, and that they don't have any place for theories. Because science is based upon fact and creation is based upon religious superstitions. It takes a lot of faith to believe the religious theories. When you are dealing with facts, you can just accept them. I thought, "Very interesting in that science class, they taught me it was a fact that the world was four billion years old. Now today they are teaching it's a fact that the world is twelve billion years old. And it wasn't that long ago that I went to school."<br/>It's interesting that the Bible has never needed to be revised or updated to meet the current data that men have discovered. And yet, if you would take my high school science textbooks today and try to teach a science class from them, you would find that many of the things that were taught as scientific fact when I was in high school are no longer recognized as scientific fact. The simple cell protoplasm is no longer a simple cell, but extremely complex. If there is any fact that can be attested to in history it is the fact of the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.<br/>We have a jurisprudence system that is based upon the testimony of witnesses. If a man is accused of a crime and there are people who witnessed that crime while it was being committed, and they are brought to the standard, and they swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help them God. And in their questioning they affirm that, "I saw that man in the bank on May twenty-third. I saw him pull out a gun from his coat. I heard him demand that all of the money be given to him. I saw him as he left the bank. I saw him as the officer apprehended him outside." And if you can get three or four witnesses to point to that man and will keep their testimony under cross-examination, that man is judged to be guilty. He is the one who did it. We have two or three witnesses that are testifying the same story about that man, and it is accepted as fact that he is the one who perpetrated the crime and is guilty. You've got witnesses who have sworn to tell the truth that are verifying.<br/>After the death of Jesus, when He rose again, He appeared unto many different people who gave sworn testimony that they saw Him. That they talked to Him, that He appeared to them in various places under different circumstances. And for a period of forty days was visiting with them. And at one time, up to as many as five hundred people who were gathered at one place, He appeared. It's difficult to just cast aside or deny the witness of these people. To do so is to discredit our whole jurisprudence system. But not only that, these men who testified that they saw the risen Lord, that they talked to Him, that they ate with Him, they, all of them, with the exception of one, met violent deaths at the hands of other people because of their affirming that the story they told was true. You talk about witnesses sworn to tell the truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth. If a person's life was threatened because of that witness, and it was a lie, at least one them would've broken under the pressure. They would've confessed to the entire hoax. "He showed Himself alive after His passion by many infallible proofs."<br/>being seen of them for forty days, speaking to them of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God ( Act 1:3 ):<br/>Sometimes we fault the disciples because of their questions of the timing of the kingdom of God. Let it be remembered that the kingdom of God was the favorite subject of Jesus Christ. He was always talking about the kingdom of God, and it is a great hope that He was planting into the hearts of all men. Things are not always going to continue corrupted as they are. The world is not going to go forever under the power of darkness, under the bondage of evil. God is going to one day establish His kingdom upon the earth. A kingdom of righteous joy and peace. "Jesus shall reign, where ere the sun doth her successive journeys run. And His kingdom will extend from shore to shore." And that day will be the most glorious day the world has ever seen, as sickness and suffering and pain will be abolished in His kingdom. As sin and greed and these things that have made the world such an intolerable place will be abolished in His kingdom. The godless commercialism, the exploitation of man, all of these things abolished in His glorious kingdom when He reigns. No wonder the disciples were anxious to get it on. I'm anxious to get it on; I'm anxious for His kingdom to come. And Jesus told us when we pray, the first petition is, "Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven" ( Mat 6:10 ). This is the right kind of a desire that we should all have. I desire the kingdom of God. And so He was talking to them, during this forty-day period, of the kingdom.<br/>And, being assembled together with them, he commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which, saith he, you have heard of me ( Act 1:4 ).<br/>He said, "Now look, wait here in Jerusalem until you receive the promise of the Father." This promise that He is referring to is, no doubt, the promise in Joel where the Lord promised, "And it shall come to pass in the later days, saith the Lord, that I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and daughters will prophesy, and your young men shall dream dreams, your old men shall see visions: and upon my servants and my handmaidens shall I pour out my Spirit, saith the Lord" ( Joe 2:28-29 ). The promise of the Father: the day is going to come when God is going to pour out His Spirit upon all flesh, all of the believers. They will, each one, receive that dynamic from God.<br/>For John [He said,] truly baptized with water; but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now ( Act 1:5 ).<br/>The idea of baptism was that of emersion, the bapteedzo. John baptized with water, submerged the people in water, "you're going to be submerged in the Holy Spirit in not many days."<br/>Now when they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, will you at this time restore the kingdom to Israel? ( Act 1:6 )<br/>"When is it going to be, Lord? When's the time for this restoration?" And Jesus is talking to them now, not about the kingdom, but about the power that they're going to receive for service. And so He brushes aside their question.<br/>Saying unto them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father has put in his own power ( Act 1:7 ).<br/>"It's not for you to know." They lived constantly in the anticipation of the immediate setting up of the kingdom. During the entire lifetime of Jesus, they were expecting Him at any moment to go into the phone booth and come out as the savior of the world. Shazzam! Showing His power and overthrowing the governments of the world, establishing God's kingdom upon the earth. And they were waiting daily for this change to transpire. And whenever Jesus would talk about going to Jerusalem, being turned over into the hands of sinful man, and then being crucified, "Oh, oh no, Lord. No, no you don't understand the kingdom, Lord. Be that far from Thee." When Jesus died on the cross, they were all greatly disappointed.<br/>The two disciples on the road to Emmaus, so sad. "Hey, fellows. How come you're so sad as your walking along?" "What do you mean? You must be a stranger around here if you don't know the things that have been happening lately in Jerusalem." "What things?" "Oh, a fellow by the name of Jesus of Nazareth...oh man, it was mighty and powerful. The anointing of God was upon His life. We had hoped that in Him was the deliverance of Israel, but they crucified Him. We had hoped . . . now it's dead." Now He's risen, and He's saying, "In a few days, fellows, you're going to receive the promise of the Father." "Oh, what promise? The promise of the establishing of the kingdom?" You see, it was legitimate that they should ask. "Is this it Lord? Alright! Is this the time? Are you going to set up your kingdom now?" "No. It's not for you to know those times that the Father's appointed or that the Father has in His own power. But, you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you."<br/>Now here, the Greek preposition epi is used to signify a new relationship that they were to have with the Holy Spirit. In the Gospel According to John, chapter 14, as Jesus is there promising to send the Holy Spirit, He said, "I will not leave you comfortless. I will come to you, and I will pray the Father, and He will send to you another comforter, even the Spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth Him not neither knows Him, but you know Him for He dwells with you, and He shall be in you" ( Joh 14:17-18 ). Same Greek preposition as ours, only they spell it "en" instead of "in." Two-fold relationship there in John: He is with you, but He's going to be dwelling in you. But now Jesus said you're going to receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you. The Greek preposition epi, which is translated in different texts throughout the New Testament as "upon" or "over" or I like it, "overflows."<br/>In the seventh chapter of the gospel of John: "On the last day, the great day of the feast when Jesus stood there on the Temple Mount and cried to the people, 'If any man thirst let him come unto Me and drink: and he who drinks of the water that I give, out of his innermost being there will gush torrents of living water.'" John said, "This spake He of the Spirit, which was not yet given which they who believe on Him should receive" ( Joh 7:37-39 ). What did He speak of the Spirit? That it would be like a torrent of living water flowing out. I like, "When the Spirit overflows you," upon you, or over you, or overflows from you. So the three-fold relationship: He is with you prior to your conversion, He is the one who causes you to realize that you are a sinner, He is the one who points to Jesus Christ as the answer as He convinces the world of sin, of righteous, and of judgment. The moment you open your life and heart to Jesus Christ and invite Him to come in, the Holy Spirit comes and begins to indwell you. He shall be in you. "Know ye not that you are not your own, you have been bought with a price, therefore glorify God in your body and your spirit which are His. And know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit which is in you? Be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess, but be filled, or be ye being filled with the Spirit" ( 1Co 6:19-20 ,Eph 5:18 ). But now here's a third relationship. This is an empowering experience.<br/>You will receive [the dunamus] the dynamics, when the Holy Spirit has come [epi] upon you [or over you, or when there is that overflow from you]: and ye shall be witnesses unto me ( Act 1:8 )<br/>And so the dynamic, to be a witness for Jesus Christ. It is interesting that the word witness in Greek is the word martus from where we get our word martyr. And in Greek it does mean martyr. A witness is one who not only proclaims what he believes, he lives what he believes, he is what he believes, and he believes it so strongly, that if necessary, he'll die for what he believes. That's how strong is his belief. He's a martus. You can't stop him. He's not afraid to die for what he believes.<br/>You remember when Paul was on his way back to Jerusalem and Agabus came down from Caesarea and he took Paul's girdle and tied himself up and he said, "So is the man who owns this girdle to be bound when he gets to Jerusalem." And Paul's friends began to weep, saying, "Oh, Paul, don't go, don't go." And he said, "What do you mean by these tears? Do you think you're going to dissuade me? Do you think I'm worried about being bound? I'm ready to die." He was a martus. "I'm ready to die." Being put to death for your faith did not make you a martyr; because you were a martyr, you were put to death. Because you were a witness, because you believed it so strong. So, it did not make you a witness, it only proved what you were. You were a witness all along. If you hadn't been a martus, you would've never gone to your death. You would've recanted; you would've said, "Whoa, whoa, wait, wait. Hold on, let's change course here. I think that I may have made a mistake." Then you say, "Well, he wasn't a martus. Stealing a horse doesn't make you a horse thief; it only proves that you were. No one steals a horse unless he's a horse thief. So, stealing it doesn't make you a horse thief, it only proves that you were all along. Being martyred only proves what you were a witness, a martus. "And you will be witnesses." And isn't it interesting that most of them were martyred? "Witnesses unto Me."<br/>The witness was to be both in Jerusalem, and in all of Judea ( Act 1:8 ),<br/>The witness began right at home. The hardest place, isn't it? It's to start right at home in Jerusalem, and then the area around Jerusalem, the area of Judea. And then it was to spread up into Samaria. And then it was to go out into the uttermost parts of the world. And as we study the book of Acts, we will see this very progression. How the witness began in Jerusalem. We'll get that in the next chapter. And then we'll see how it began to spread through out Judea. And then Phillip went up into Samaria, and then finally Paul and Barnabas are called to go into the uttermost parts of the world. And so the witness spread through the anointing and the empowering of the Holy Spirit.<br/>Now when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight ( Act 1:9 ).<br/>This is the final promise made by Jesus to His disciples. This is it, the final words prior to His ascension. Of course, later He came and talked to Paul and others, but prior to His ascension, this is His final word. And upon this, when He had spoken these things, while they were watching Him, He was taken up and a cloud received Him out of their sight.<br/>And while they were looking steadfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, there were two men who stood by them in white apparel ( Act 1:10 );<br/>We assume they were angels.<br/>Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as you have seen him go into heaven ( Act 1:11 ).<br/>They saw Him as He ascended up into heaven and they will behold Him when He comes again. "Behold the Lord cometh with ten thousands of His saints, to execute judgement upon the earth" (Jud 1:14-15). And then, "Unto Him who loved us and gave Himself for us and who has made us unto our God, kings and priests who shall reign with Him upon the earth, behold the Lord cometh, and every eye shall see Him, and they also who pierced Him shall mourn" Rev 1:5-7 ). So the Lord's coming. Every eye shall see Him. The Jehovah Witnesses say that He is already come, but it was a secret coming. As it was only the disciples that saw Him go, it was only the disciples, of the Jehovah Witnesses, who saw Him return. But Jesus said, "If they say unto you, 'He has come in secret and has gone into a secret chamber don't believe it'" ( Mat 24:26 ). So you have to choose, to believe Jesus or them.<br/>"This same Jesus which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as you've seen Him go into heaven."<br/>Now there's a very interesting verse in II John, verse Act 1:7 , "For many deceivers are entered into the world who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh." That, unfortunately, is a poor translation of the Greek. For this participle is in the present tense and should be translated "is coming in the flesh." Those who would deny that Jesus Christ is coming in the flesh. What does John say of them? "They are a deceiver and an antichrist. Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward. For whosoever transgresses and abides not in the doctrine of Christ, has not God. He that abides in the doctrine of Christ, he has both the Father and the Son. And if there come any unto your door (on Saturday morning) and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, and neither bid him good-bye. For he that bids him good-bye is a partaker of his evil deeds" (2Jn 1:7-11). Ask them one question, "Is Jesus coming in the flesh?" Just ask them that question. And if they say no, just remember what John warned you and what John told you. "If any confess not that Jesus Christ is coming in the flesh." Do you remember when He was with the disciples and He said, "Give me something to eat"? He said, "You know, spirits don't eat; touch me. See? It's me." So, this same Jesus is coming again in the same manner in which they saw Him go into heaven. And I, for one, believe that that coming is very soon.<br/>Then retuned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a Sabbath's day journey [about two-thirds of a mile]. And when they were come in, they went up into an upper room, where there abode both Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, and Phillip, and Thomas, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon Zelotes, and Judas the brother of James. And these all continued in one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers ( Act 1:12-14 ).<br/>This is the last mention of Mary the mother of Jesus. At this point and from this point on, there is no further mention of her in the Acts of the Apostles or in the epistles. No mention of her death or of her miraculous ascension into heaven, without death. Nothing is mentioned in the scripture. It is silent.<br/>His brethren would be a reference probably to James and to Jude and to those other brothers who were sons of Joseph and Mary.<br/>The upper room--there are some who say that it is the same upper room in which Jesus had the Last Supper with His disciples. And yet, there are others who hold to this upper room being a room in the temple precincts where the early church met. Take your choice.<br/>And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples, and said, (the number of their names together were about one hundred and twenty,) men and brethren, this Scripture must needs have been fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit by the mouth of David spake before concerning Judas, which was a guide to those who took Jesus ( Act 1:15-16 ).<br/>Here again, Peter still his same impetuous self. They're waiting in prayer and supplication, and Peter stands up and says, "Fellows, there's a scripture that's gotta be fulfilled." And you know he's going to move ahead, "Let's get the program going; let's cast lots and find out who's going to take Judas' place." I do feel that Peter was again in the flesh, manifesting that impetuous nature that was his. And I think that the future history of the church in the book of Acts points this out. I am interested in Peter's understanding of the scriptures, how that he is quoting from so many places in the Old Testament. Peter does manifest a very great understanding of the Old Testament scriptures which is a point in his favor.<br/>Notice that Peter ascribes to the Holy Spirit those things that David wrote. So that, "All scripture is given by inspiration of God" ( 2Ti 3:16 ). Not part of the scriptures. Because, if you tell me that part of the scriptures are given by inspiration of God, then I must ask you, "What parts are by inspiration and what parts are not by inspiration?" And then you are then the authority who tells me what part I can believe and what part I can't believe. And the minute that God is no longer the authority but you're the authority, I'm in trouble. Beware of those who say, "Well, you can't believe all of the scriptures." The scriptures themselves say, "All scripture is given by inspiration of God." And here, Luke in writing of what Peter was saying, declares that David was actually the spokesman for the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit, by the mouth of David, spake concerning Judas.<br/>For he was numbered with us, [he was one of the twelve] he had obtained a part of this ministry. But now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity; and falling headlong ( Act 1:17-18 ),<br/>He purchased the field, the potter's field as Zachariah the eleventh chapter declares.<br/>and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all of his bowels gushed out ( Act 1:18 ).<br/>There are those who find a discrepancy in the scriptures, because in one of the gospels we are told that when Judas came back and tried to return the money, and they said, "Hey, it's your problem. We can't take it." And put it back in the temple treasury. "It's blood money." Then he threw it there on the floor of the temple and he went out and hung himself. Here Peter tells us that he fell headlong and just popped. And there are those who imagine a discrepancy. Very simple, he went up into the tree to hang himself, tied the rope around his neck and tied it to the limb and jumped. And the force of the fall either snapped the rope or his head, and he fell on down into the canyon and just as he said it here.<br/>It was known to all of the dwellers at Jerusalem; insomuch that the field is called in their tongue, Aceldama, that is to say, The field of blood. For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be desolate, and let no man dwell therein: and, His bishoprick let another take ( Act 1:19-20 ).<br/>Now in reality he's quoting from two different Psalms here. From Psa 69:25 ,he puts it together with Psa 109:8 . And putting the two together he finds these prophecies concerning Judas.<br/>Wherefore of these men ( Act 1:21 )<br/>Now here is where they are looking for someone to take Judas' place to be an apostle. Here are the qualifications they looked for in that time.<br/>Wherefore of these men which have companied with us all the time that the Lord Jesus when in and out among us ( Act 1:21 ),<br/>Now you remember there were many disciples, many disciples of which Jesus chose ten to be apostles. And the word apostle means "one who is sent out." Or chose twelve to be apostles, so He sent out the twelve. The number of human government. "We only have eleven. We need one to take Judas' place, but we need one who has been with us all the while from the beginning with Jesus."<br/>From the time he was baptized by John, until the day he was taken up from us, must one be ordained to be a witness [of what?] of His resurrection ( Act 1:22 ).<br/>So these were the requirements they were looking for. Someone who had been around the whole while. From the time of John's baptism to the ascension. And one who saw the risen Lord, and thus could bear fact of the resurrection, their testimony to the fact.<br/>Now Paul the apostle, later in asserting the fact that he was an apostle said, "Have I not seen the risen Christ?" Evidently that was one of the requirements of apostleship. Someone asked me, "Are there apostles today?" Well, I don't know. I don't think that there are in the same sense that they were in the New Testament. Surely there is none today who can bear witness to the resurrection as they did.<br/>They appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias. And they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord, which knowest the hearts of all men, show whether of these two that you have chosen ( Act 1:23-24 ),<br/>I think that we often make this mistake of giving the Lord two choices, both wrong. Limiting God, you see. We're so prone to do this. Obviously, Paul was God's choice. Peter was impetuous, and jumping the gun said, "Hey, we've got to do something, you know, gotta help God out. You know, one's missing and we've got to fill him in." And yet, "God, which one of these two do you want?" And giving God the two choices.<br/>That he may take part of this ministry and this apostleship, from which Judas by the transgression fell, that he might go to his own place. And so they gave forth their lots ( Act 1:25-26 );<br/>An interesting way by which they sought to determine the will of God. Let's throw dice, find out what God's will is here. It's interesting to me, the various ways that people have devised to discern the will of God. Now, in the Old Testament times they had an interesting way of coming to the priest, who would inquire of the Lord for them through the Urim and the Thummim, the "lights and perfections." Just what these Urim and Thummim were, we don't know. I'm sure they were not the colored glasses that Joseph Smith found with the Golden Tablets; the magic glasses, that when you put them on, you could suddenly read the hieroglyphic writing.<br/>There are those who say that the Urim and Thummim were actually a black and a white stone that was worn in a pouch on the chest of the priest. They would pray and ask the Lord a particular question. You remember that David was asking the Lord definite questions: "Lord, shall we go out against the Philistines?" The answer was, "No." So again, the next day, "Lord, shall we go out against the Philistines?" The answer was, "Yes." "When shall we go?" They would ask specific questions, and the Lord would direct them through the Urim and the Thummin. They say that the priest would pray, seek God, and then reach in and pull out one of the two stones. If it was the white stone, it was a yes answer. If it was a no, then it would be the black stone that he would pull out. Some even say we get the term blackballed from this Urim and Thummim. Actually, back in the original it is a no vote against a particular project or idea. Just what the Urim and Thummim were, we don't know. But during the Old Testament period, they did use a method of casting lots to determine the will of God.<br/>So here the disciples are picking up on the same thing as they are throwing the dice to see which of the two fellows that God had chosen to replace Judas Iscariot.<br/>the lot fell on Matthias; he was numbered with the eleven ( Act 1:26 ).<br/>Now who in the world is Matthias? No one ever heard of him before or since. It'll be interesting to meet Matthias and find out who he is and what he did. I think from the subsequent history, it's obvious to assume that God chose Paul as an apostle. Paul declares it himself. Now this is the last time we ever read of them seeking to discern the will of God by the casting of lots or by a chance kind of a thing.<br/>I know a fellow today, in seeking to discern the will of the Lord, will pray and ask the Lord a question. He'll have ten pennies in his pocket, and as he's praying, he'll take the pennies with his eyes closed and put them down on the table, and if they all come up heads, it's a yes. An interesting thing, every once in a while, they'll all come up heads, and that's pretty good odds. Yet, we don't find any pattern for this after the Holy Spirit was given. Once the Holy Spirit came upon the church, then the Holy Spirit began to speak to them and direct them. And the Holy Spirit said, "Separate unto me Paul and Barnabas for the ministry where I have called them" ( Act 13:2 ). And the Holy Spirit sent them forth. So we find the church more directly guided by the Holy Spirit. Once the Holy Spirit came, this throwing dice to find out the will of God was set aside.<br/>"<br/><br/>King James Version<br/><br/>This is the 1769 King James Version of the Holy Bible (also known as the Authorized Version). "Public Domain" | Смит Чък - Чрез Библията C2000 SeriesShall ние се обръщаме към книгата Деяния, глава първа, тъй като ние започваме нашето изследване на ранната църква.<br/>Лука, авторът на книгата Деяния, спътник на апостол Павел, който е автор и на Евангелието Според Лука, пише тези два трактата на приятел, Теофил. Теофил е гръцко име. Това е име, което има красиво значение. Името означава "любител на Бога". Има някои, които вярват, че това изобщо не е бил човек, а че евангелието и книгата Деяния са били адресирани до любителите на Бога, който и да си. Има и други предания, които казват, че Теофил всъщност е бил господар на Лука, че в онези дни лекарите са били роби, обикновено роби на богат покровител. Така че господарят на Лука бил Теофил и той освободил Лука, за да бъде с Павел по време на мисионерските пътувания. Така Лука пише обратно на бившия си господар. Това е ранна традиция на църквата, но е, разбира се, невъзможно да се докаже, както толкова много от традициите.<br/>Има и такива, които вярват, че когато Павел е бил в Троада и е получил видение на човек, който го вика, казвайки: "Елате в Македония и ни помогнете", че този човек във видението на Павел не е бил никой друг освен Лука. Защото първият, когото Павел наистина срещна, когато дойде в Македония, беше Лука. И както сме в книгата Деяния, ще откриете, че когато стигнем до тази част от книгата Деяния, Лука започва да пише повече в първо лице, а не в трето лице. Така че, очевидно, в този конкретен момент в Деянията на апостолите, Лука стана спътник на Павел и започна да пътува с него. Той започна да използва местоименията "ние" и "нас" вместо "те" и "тях". Това без съмнение е мястото, където Люк стана участник и очевидец на тези неща, които се случваха от този момент нататък.<br/>Той започва Деянията на апостолите, като го обвързва с Евангелието според Лука. Интересно е, че последното нещо, което Лука записва в своето евангелие, е първото нещо, което той записва в Деянията на апостолите. Намираме евангелието на Лука за завършващо, когато Исус казва на учениците Си да чакат в Ерусалим, докато бъдат надарени със сила от горе. И тогава Исус се възнесе на небето и така той затваря евангелието. Отваряйки Деянията на апостолите, той пише:<br/>Предишният трактат [т.е. Евангелието според Лука] съм ти написал, о, Теофиле, от всичко, което Исус започна да прави и поучава (Деяния 1:1 ),<br/>Ключовата дума е започнала. Евангелието според Лука не е пълната история на служението на Исус Христос. Това е само началото на служението на Исус Христос. Исус продължава да служи на нуждите на хората. Исус продължава да лекува болните. Исус продължава да възкресява мъртвите. Исус продължава да служи на Неговата любов и Неговото евангелие на света, едва сега Той служи чрез онези ученици, които са били помазани със Святия Си Дух. Но служението на Христос продължава; основно е предпоставката, която Лука приема в Деянията на апостолите. Предишният трактат за всичко, което Исус е започнал, както да прави, така и да поучава.<br/>Сега, поради това, Деянията на апостолите е недовършена книга: в това, че Господ днес продължава да работи през живота на тези, които са се посветили да бъдат инструменти на Бога. Да бъде воден и ръководен и помазан от Светия Си Дух, да продължи служението на Исус в света днес. Сега Бог е предопределил, че Неговата работа трябва да бъде изпълнена чрез човешки инструменти. Не казвам, че трябва да бъде изпълнена. Бог може да използва ангелски същества за Своето дело и ще дойде време, по време на книгата Откровение, когато Бог ще използва ангели, за да провъзгласи евангелието Си на хората по целия свят. Откровение, глава 14, "Първият ангел, който лети през средата на небето, имайки вечното евангелие" (Откровение 14:6). Но в днешно време Бог е избрал да използва човешки инструменти. Колкото и несъвършени да са, все пак това е, което Бог е предопределил да използва. Вълнуващото в това е, че Бог ще ме използва и Бог ще те използва. Толкова много пъти, ние се молим, "Господи, не мога да говоря. Никога не съм бил в състояние да говоря преди или дори сега, Господи." Както Мойсей се опита да измоли от призива на Бог. Еремия каза: "Господи, аз съм просто дете; никой няма да ме слуша." И всички си имаме извинения защо не можем да бъдем използвани. Не сме ли? Всички знаем причините, поради които Бог не може да ни използва.<br/>Веднъж, когато Господ е призовавал пророк да върши Неговата работа, той казал: "Господи, изпрати когото искаш." Господ казал: "Хей, аз те повиках." "Господи, добра идея; изпрати когото искаш." Толкова често сме в тази позиция, "Господи, изпрати чрез ръката на когото искаш, всеки друг, освен мен, Господи." И все пак, Бог е предопределил да ни използва.<br/>Сега, всеки от нас може да покаже собствените си несъвършенства. Всеки от нас може да посочи собствените си неспособности и всички ние можем да намерим извинение защо Бог не би искал да ме използва. Но все пак, Бог е избрал да ви използва. Чудиш се, когато Бог има такива инструменти, с които да използва как изобщо е свършил работата, нали?<br/>До деня, в който се възнесе, след това чрез Светия Дух беше дал заповеди на апостолите, които бе избрал (Деяния 1:2):<br/>Това е, което той завършва Евангелието на Лука с. Денят, в който Исус е бил взет, след като е казал на апостолите да чакат за дара на властта.<br/>На когото той също се показа жив, след като страстта му [или смъртта] от много непогрешими доказателства (Деян. 1:3 ),<br/>Трудно е да се отрече фактът на възкресението на Исус Христос. Бях развеселен, както и раздразнен и раздразнен, от статия, която прочетох в регистъра на Санта Ана миналата събота. За науката за сътворението и еволюционните теории, които се представят в окръжните училища, как така, този един професор каза, че преподава научен клас, и по този начин, те се занимават само с факти, и че нямат място за теории. Защото науката се основава на фактите, а сътворението се основава на религиозни суеверия. Изисква се много вяра, за да повярваш на религиозните теории. Когато се занимаваш с факти, можеш просто да ги приемеш. Мислех си, "Много интересно в този научен клас, те ме научиха, че е факт, че светът е на четири милиарда години. Сега днес те преподават, че е факт, че светът е на дванадесет милиарда години. И не беше толкова отдавна, когато отидох на училище."<br/>Интересно е, че Библията никога не е трябвало да бъде ревизирана или актуализирана, за да отговори на настоящите данни, които мъжете са открили. И все пак, ако вземете учебниците ми по природни науки днес и се опитате да преподавате научен клас от тях, ще откриете, че много от нещата, които са били преподавани като научен факт, когато бях в гимназията, вече не са признати като научен факт. Простата клетъчна протоплазма вече не е проста клетка, а изключително сложна. Ако има някакъв факт, който може да бъде засвидетелстван в историята, това е фактът на възкресението на Исус Христос от мъртвите.<br/>Имаме съдебна система, която се основава на показанията на свидетелите. Ако човек е обвинен в престъпление и има хора, които са били свидетели на това престъпление, докато е било извършено, и те са доведени до стандарта, и те се кълнат да казват истината, цялата истина и нищо друго освен истината, така че да им помогне Бог. И в разпита си те потвърждават, че: "Видях този човек в банката на двадесет и трети май. Видях го да вади пистолет от палтото си. Чух го да изисква да му се дадат всички пари. Видях го, когато напускаше банката. Видях го, както офицерът го задържа отвън." И ако можете да накарате трима или четирима свидетели да посочат този човек и да запазят показанията си под кръстосан разпит, този човек е осъден за виновен. Той е този, който го е направил. Имаме двама или трима свидетели, които свидетелстват една и съща история за този човек, и се приема като факт, че той е извършил престъплението и е виновен.<br/>След смъртта на Исус, когато възкръсна, Той се яви на много различни хора, които дадоха клетвени показания, че са Го видели, че са Му говорили, че им се е явил на различни места при различни обстоятелства. И за период от четиридесет дни ги посещаваше, и по едно време, до петстотин души, събрани на едно място, Той се яви. Трудно е просто да се отхвърли или отрече свидетелството на тези хора. Да направим това е да дискредитираме цялата ни съдебна система. Но не само това, тези мъже, които свидетелстваха, че са видели възкръсналия Господ, че са говорили с Него, че са яли с Него, те, всички те, с изключение на един, срещнаха насилствена смърт от ръцете на други хора, защото потвърждават, че историята, която разказват, е вярна. Говориш за свидетели, заклели се да казват истината, цялата истина, нищо друго освен истината, ако животът на човек е бил застрашен заради този свидетел, а това е било лъжа, поне един от тях би се пречупил под натиска. Те щяха да признаят цялата измама. "Той се показа жив след страстта си с много непогрешими доказателства."<br/>като се вижда от тях четиридесет дни, като им говори за нещата, отнасящи се до Божието царство (Деяния 1:3):<br/>Понякога обвиняваме учениците заради техните въпроси за времето на Божието царство. Нека си спомним, че Божието царство беше любимият предмет на Исус Христос. Той винаги е говорил за Божието царство и е голяма надежда, че Той е посял в сърцата на всички хора. Нещата не винаги ще продължат да се покваряват, както са. Светът няма да върви вечно под властта на тъмнината, под робството на злото. Бог ще един ден установи Своето царство на земята. Царство на праведна радост и мир. "Исус ще царува, преди слънцето да е изтекло, и царството Му ще се простира от бряг до бряг." И този ден ще бъде най-славният ден, който светът някога е виждал, като болест, страдание и болка ще бъдат премахнати в Неговото царство. Като грях и алчност и тези неща, които са направили света толкова непоносимо място, ще бъдат премахнати в Неговото царство. Безбожният комерсиализъм, експлоатацията на човека, всички тези неща бяха премахнати в Неговото славно царство, когато Той царува. Нищо чудно, че учениците бяха нетърпеливи да го получат. Аз съм нетърпелив да го получа; Аз съм нетърпелив за Неговото царство да дойде. И Исус ни каза, когато се молим, първата молба е: "Да дойде Твоето царство; да бъде Твоята воля както на земята, така и на небето" (Матей 6:10). Това е правилният вид желание, което всички ние трябва да имаме. Аз желая Божието царство. И така, Той им говореше, през този четиридесетдневен период, на царството.<br/>И като се събра заедно с тях, Той им заповяда да не се отклоняват от Ерусалим, а да чакат обещанието на Отца, което, казва Той, сте чули за Мен (Деяния 1:4).<br/>Той каза: "Вижте сега, чакайте тук в Ерусалим, докато не получите обещанието на Отца." Това обещание, което Той има предвид, е, без съмнение, обещанието в Йоил, където Господ обеща: "И в по-късните дни, казва Господ, ще излея Духа Си на всяка плът; и синовете и дъщерите ви ще пророкуват, и младежите ви ще сънуват сънища, старците ви ще виждат видения; и върху слугите ми и слугините ми ще излея Духа Си, казва Господ" (Йоил 2:28-29). Обещанието на Отца: ще дойде ден, когато Бог ще излее Духа Си върху всяка плът, всички вярващи. Те ще получат, всеки един, тази динамика от Бога.<br/>Защото Йоан [Той] наистина се кръсти с вода; но вие ще се кръстите със Светия Дух не след много дни (Деяния 1:5).<br/>Идеята за кръщението била тази на емерсиона, баптидецото. Йоан кръщавал с вода, потапял хората във вода, "ще бъдете потопени в Светия Дух за не много дни".<br/>А те, като се събраха, попитаха Го, казвайки: Господи, ще възвърнеш ли в това време царството на Израиля?<br/>"Кога ще бъде, Господи? Кога е времето за това възстановяване?" И Исус им говори сега, не за царството, а за силата, която ще получат за служба. И така Той отхвърля въпроса им.<br/>Казвайки им: Не е за вас да знаете времената или сезоните, които Отец е вложил в Своята сила (Деяния 1:7).<br/>"Това не е за вас да знаете." Те живееха постоянно в очакване на незабавното установяване на царството. През целия живот на Исус, те са Го очаквали във всеки един момент да отиде в телефонната кабина и да излезе като спасител на света. Шазам! Показвайки силата си и сваляйки правителствата на света, установявайки Божието царство на земята. И те чакаха ежедневно тази промяна да се случи. И всеки път, когато Исус говореше за отиване в Ерусалим, да бъде предаден в ръцете на грешния човек, а след това да бъде разпнат, "О, не, Господи. Не, ти не разбираш царството, Господи, бъди толкова далеч от Теб." Когато Исус умря на кръста, всички бяха много разочаровани.<br/>Двамата ученици по пътя към Емаус, толкова тъжни. "Ей, приятели. Как така сте толкова тъжни, като вървите заедно?" "Какво имате предвид? Трябва да сте странник наоколо, ако не знаете нещата, които се случват напоследък в Йерусалим." "Какви неща?" "О, един човек на име Исус от Назарет... о, човече, беше могъщо и могъщо. Помазанието на Бог беше на Неговия живот. Надявахме се, че в Него е избавлението на Израел, но Го разпнаха. Надявахме се ... . . . сега е мъртво." Сега Той е възкръснал и казва: "След няколко дни, приятели, ще получите обещанието на Отца." "О, какво обещание? Обещанието за установяване на царството?" Виждате ли, легитимно беше да попитат. "Това ли е Господ? Добре! Сега ли е времето? Сега ли ще установите царството си?" "Не, не е за вас да знаете онези времена, които Отец е определил или които Отец има в Своята сила. Но ще получите сила, когато Светият Дух дойде върху вас."<br/>Тук гръцкият предлог епи се използва, за да обозначи нова връзка, която е трябвало да имат със Светия Дух. В Евангелието от Йоан, глава 14, както Исус е там обещава да изпрати Светия Дух, Той каза: "Няма да ви оставя без утеха. Аз ще дойда при вас и ще се моля на Отца, и Той ще ви изпрати друг утешител, Духът на Истината, когото светът не може да приеме, защото не Го вижда, нито Го познава, но вие Го познавате, защото Той живее с вас и Той ще бъде във вас" (Йоан 14:17-18). Същия гръцки предлог като нашия, само че го изписват "en" вместо "in". Двусмислена връзка там в Йоан: Той е с вас, но Той ще обитава във вас. Но сега Исус каза, че ще получите сила, когато Светият Дух дойде върху вас. Гръцкият предлог епи, който се превежда в различни текстове в целия Нов Завет като "on" или "over" или ми харесва, "overflows".<br/>В седмата глава на евангелието на Йоан: "В последния ден, великият ден на празника, когато Исус стоеше там на Храмовия хълм и викаше на хората: "Ако някой човек е жаден, нека дойде при Мен и да пие; и който пие от водата, която давам, от най-съкровеното си същество там ще бликнат потоци от жива вода." Йоан каза: "Този говори за Духа, който още не е даден, който вярващите в Него трябва да приемат" (Йох 7:37-39). Какво говори Той за Духа? Че ще бъде като поток от жива вода, изтичаща. Харесва ми, "Когато Духът ви прелива", върху вас, или над вас, или прелива от вас. Така че тройната връзка: Той е с вас преди вашето обръщане, Той е този, който ви кара да осъзнаете, че сте грешник, Той е този, който посочва Исус Христос като отговор, тъй като Той убеждава света на греха, на правдата и на съда. В момента, в който отворите живота и сърцето си към Исус Христос и Го поканите да влезе, Светият Дух идва и започва да се вселява във вас. Той ще бъде във вас. "Не знаете ли, че не сте свои, купени сте с цена, затова прославете Бога във вашето тяло и във вашия дух, които са Негови. И не знаете ли, че вашето тяло е храм на Светия Дух, който е във вас? Не се опивайте с вино, в което има излишък, но се насищайте, или се изпълвайте с Духа" (1Коринтяни 6:19-20, Ефесяни 5:18). Но сега ето трета връзка. Това е овластяващо преживяване.<br/>Ще получите динамиката, когато Светият Дух дойде върху вас [или над вас, или когато има това преливане от вас]. И ще ми бъдете свидетели (Деяния 1:8).<br/>Интересно е, че думата "свидетел" на гръцки е думата "март", от която получаваме думата "мъченик", а на гръцки означава "мъченик". Свидетел е този, който не само провъзгласява това, в което вярва, той живее това, в което вярва, той е това, в което вярва, и той го вярва толкова силно, че ако е необходимо, ще умре за това, в което вярва. Не се страхува да умре за това, в което вярва.<br/>Спомняте ли си, когато Павел се връщаше в Ерусалим и Агав слезе от Кесария и взе пояса на Павел и се завърза и каза: "Така е и човекът, който притежава този пояс, да бъде вързан, когато стигне до Ерусалим." И приятелите на Павел започнаха да плачат, казвайки: "О, Пол, не отивай, не отивай." И той каза: "Какво искаш да кажеш с тези сълзи? Мислиш ли, че ще ме разубедиш? Мислиш ли, че се притеснявам да не бъда вързан? Готов съм да умра." Той беше мартус. "Готов съм да умра." Да бъдеш убит заради вярата си не те е направило мъченик; защото си бил мъченик, бил си убит. Защото си бил свидетел, защото си повярвал толкова силно. Така че, това не те прави свидетел, а само доказва какъв си бил. Бил си свидетел през цялото време. Ако не беше мартус, никога нямаше да отидеш на смърт. Щеше да се отречеш; щеше да кажеш: "Уау, чакай, чакай. Чакай, нека да сменим курса тук. Мисля, че може да съм направил грешка." Тогава казвате: "Е, той не беше мартус. Кражбата на кон не те прави крадец на коне, а само доказва, че си бил. Никой не краде кон, освен ако не е крадец на коне. Така че, кражбата не те прави крадец на коне, а само доказва, че си бил през цялото време. Да бъдеш мъченик доказва само това, което си бил свидетел, мартус. "И вие ще бъдете свидетели." И не е ли интересно, че повечето от тях са били мъчени? "Свидетелства към Мен."<br/>Свидетелят трябваше да бъде както в Ерусалим, така и в цяла Юдея (Деяния 1:8),<br/>Свидетелят е започнал точно у дома. Най-трудното място, нали? Това е да се започне веднага у дома в Ерусалим, а след това в района около Йерусалим, района на Юдея. И след това е трябвало да се разпространи в Самария. И след това е трябвало да излезе в най-отдалечените части на света. И докато изучаваме книгата Деяния, ще видим точно това развитие. Как е започнало свидетелството в Ерусалим. Ще го получим в следващата глава. И тогава ще видим как е започнало да се разпространява из Юдея, а след това Филип се е изкачил в Самария и накрая Павел и Варнава са призовани да отидат в най-отдалечените части на света. И така свидетелството се разпространило чрез помазването и даването на сила на Светия Дух.<br/>А като каза това, докато гледаха, той се възнесе; и облак Го прие от погледа им (Деян.1:9).<br/>Това е последното обещание, дадено от Исус на Неговите ученици. Това е то, последните думи преди Неговото възнесение. Разбира се, по-късно Той дойде и говори с Павел и други, но преди Неговото възнесение, това е Неговото последно слово. И като каза това, докато Го гледаха, Той се възнесе и облак Го прие от погледа им.<br/>И докато гледаха към небето, когато се издигаше, ето, имаше двама мъже, които стояха до тях в бели дрехи (Деяния 1:10);<br/>Предполагаме, че са били ангели.<br/>Който и рече: Галилеяни, защо стоите и гледате към небето? Тоя Исус, Който се възнесе от вас на небето, така ще дойде, както сте Го видели да отива на небето (Деяния 1:11).<br/>Те Го видяха, когато се възнесе на небето и ще Го видят, когато дойде отново. "Ето Господ иде с десетки хиляди от Своите светии, за да изпълни съд на земята" (Юда 1:14-15). И тогава, "На Този, Който ни възлюби и даде Себе Си за нас, и Който ни е направил за нашия Бог, царе и свещеници, които ще царуват с Него на земята, ето, Господ иде, и всяко око ще Го види, и ония, които Го прободоха, ще скърбят" Откр 1:5-7 . И така, Господ идва. Всяко око ще Го види. Свидетелите на Йехова казват, че Той вече е дошъл, но това е било тайно идване. Тъй като само учениците, които Го видяха, отидоха, само учениците, на Свидетелите на Йехова, които Го видяха да се връща. А Исус рече: Ако ви рекат: Дошъл е тайно и е влязъл в тайна стая, не вярвайте. (Мат. 24:26). Така че трябва да изберете, да повярвате на Исус или на тях.<br/>Същият този Исус, който се възнесе от вас на небето, така ще дойде по същия начин, както Го видяхте да отива на небето.<br/>Сега има един много интересен стих във II Йоан, стих Деяния 1:7, "Защото много измамници са влезли в света, които не изповядват, че Исус Христос е дошъл в плът." Това, за съжаление, е лош превод на гръцки. Защото това причастие е в сегашно време и трябва да се преведе като "идва в плът". Тези, които биха отрекли, че Исус Христос идва в плът. Какво казва Йоан за тях? "Те са измамник и антихрист. Внимавайте на себе си, че ние не губим това, което сме направили, но че ние получаваме пълна награда. Защото, който престъпва и не се придържа към Христовото учение, няма Бог. Който пребъдва в Христовото учение, той има и Отца, и Сина. И ако някой дойде при вратата ти (в събота сутринта) и не донесе това учение, не го приемай в дома си и не му пожелавай сбогом. Защото този, който му казва сбогом, е участник в злите му дела" (2Йоан 1:7-11). Задайте им един въпрос: "Иисус ли идва в плът?" Просто им задайте този въпрос. И ако те кажат не, просто си спомнете какво ви предупреди Йоан и какво ви каза Йоан. "Ако някой не изповяда, че Исус Христос иде в плът." Спомняте ли си, когато Той беше с учениците и каза: "Дайте ми нещо за ядене?" Той каза: "Знаете ли, духовете не ядат; докоснете ме. Виждаш ли? Аз съм." И така, същият този Исус идва отново по същия начин, по който са Го видели да отива на небето. И аз, от една страна, вярвам, че това идване е много скоро.<br/>Тогава те се върнаха в Ерусалим от планината, наречена Елеонска, която е от Ерусалим на съботен път [около две трети от миля]. И като влязоха, възлязоха в една горна стая, гдето живееха и Петър, и Яков, и Йоан, и Андрей, и Филип, и Тома, и Вартоломей, и Матей, и Яков, син на Алфаей, и Симон Зилот, и Юда, брат на Яков. И всички те продължиха в единомислие в молитва и моление, с жените и Мария, майката на Исус, и с братята му (Деяния 1:12-14 ).<br/>Това е последното споменаване на Мария, майката на Исус. В този момент и от този момент нататък, не се споменава за нея в Деянията на апостолите или в посланията. Не се споменава за нейната смърт или за нейното чудотворно възнесение на небето, без смърт. Нищо не се споменава в писанието.<br/>Братята му вероятно щели да се отнасят за Яков и Юда, както и за другите братя, които били синове на Йосиф и Мария.<br/>Горната стая - има някои, които казват, че това е същата горна стая, в която Исус е имал Тайната вечеря със Своите ученици. И все пак, има и други, които държат на тази горна стая като стая в храмовете, където се е срещала ранната църква. Избери си.<br/>И в онези дни Петър стана в средата на учениците, и каза: (броят на имената им заедно беше около сто и двадесет,) мъже и братя, това писание трябва да се е изпълнило, което Светият Дух от устата на Давид говори преди това за Юда, който е бил ръководство за тези, които взеха Исус (Деяния 1:15-16 ).<br/>Тук отново Петър все още е същата буйна личност. Те чакат в молитва и моление, а Петър се изправя и казва: "Палави, има едно писание, което трябва да се изпълни." И вие знаете, че той ще продължи напред, "Нека да започнем програмата; нека хвърлим жребий и да разберем кой ще заеме мястото на Юда." Чувствам, че Петър отново е бил в плътта, проявявайки тази буйна природа, която е била негова. И мисля, че бъдещата история на църквата в книгата Деяния сочи това. Интересува ме разбирането на Петър за писанията, как той цитира от толкова много места в Стария завет. Петър проявява много голямо разбиране на старозаветните писания, което е точка в негова полза.<br/>Забележете, че Петър приписва на Светия Дух тези неща, които Давид е написал. Така че, "Цялото писание е дадено чрез вдъхновение от Бога" ( 2Ti 3:16 ). Не е част от писанията. Защото, ако ми кажете, че част от писанията са дадени чрез вдъхновение от Бога, тогава трябва да ви попитам: "Кои части са чрез вдъхновение и кои части не са чрез вдъхновение?" И тогава ти си авторитетът, който ми казва в коя част мога да вярвам и в коя не мога да вярвам и в минутата, в която Бог вече не е авторитетът, а ти си авторитетът, аз съм в беда. Пазете се от тези, които казват: "Ами, не можеш да повярваш на всички писания." Самите писания казват: "Цялото писание е дадено чрез вдъхновение от Бога." И тук, Лука в писмен вид за това, което Петър казва, заявява, че Давид всъщност е говорител на Светия Дух. Светият Дух, от устата на Давид, говори за Юда.<br/>Защото той беше преброен с нас, [той беше един от дванадесетте], които бяха получили част от това служение. Но сега този човек си купи нива с наградата на беззаконието; и падна с главата надолу (Деяния 1:17-18),<br/>Той купи нивата, грънчарската нива, както Закария заявява в единадесета глава.<br/>И като падна с главата надолу, той се разцепи в средата, и всичките му вътрешности избликнаха (Деяния 1:18).<br/>Има такива, които намират несъответствие в писанията, защото в едно от евангелията ни се казва, че когато Юда се върнал и се опитал да върне парите, те казали: "Хей, това е твой проблем. Не можем да го вземем." И го сложили обратно в съкровищницата на храма. "Това са кървави пари." След това го хвърлил там на пода на храма и той излязъл и се обесил. Тук Петър ни казва, че паднал с главата надолу и просто изскочил. А има и такива, които си представят несъответствие. Много просто, той се качил на дървото, за да се обеси, вързал въжето около врата си и го завързал за крайника и скочил. И силата на падането или счупила въжето, или главата му, и той паднал в каньона и точно както го казал тук.<br/>Това беше известно на всички жители на Ерусалим; така, че полето се нарича на езика им, Аселдама, т.е. на полето на кръвта. Защото е писано в книгата на Псалмите: Нека запустее жилището му, и никой да не живее в него; и епископът му нека вземе друг (Деяния 1:19-20).<br/>Сега в действителност той цитира от два различни псалма тук. От Пса 69:25, той го поставя заедно с Пса 109:8 . И като събира двете заедно, той намира тези пророчества относно Юда.<br/>Затова от тези мъже (Деян.1:21)<br/>Сега тук те търсят някой, който да заеме мястото на Юда, за да бъде апостол. Ето квалификациите, които са търсили през това време.<br/>Затова от тия мъже, които са се събирали с нас през цялото време, че Господ Исус, когато влиза и излиза между нас (Деян.1:21),<br/>Сега вие си спомняте, че имаше много ученици, много ученици, от които Исус избра десет да бъдат апостоли. А думата апостол означава "изпратен". Или избра дванадесет да бъдат апостоли, затова изпрати дванадесетте. Числото на човешкото управление. "Имаме само единайсет. Нужен ни е един, който да заеме мястото на Юда, но ни е нужен един, който е бил с нас през цялото време от самото начало с Исус."<br/>От времето, когато е бил кръстен от Йоан, до деня, когато е бил взет от нас, трябва ли човек да бъде ръкоположен за свидетел на Неговото възкресение (Деяния 1:22).<br/>Така че това бяха изискванията, които търсеха. Някой, който беше наоколо през цялото време. От времето на кръщението на Йоан до възнесението. И този, който видя възкръсналия Господ, и така можеше да понесе факта на възкресението, тяхното свидетелство за факта.<br/>Сега апостол Павел, по-късно в отстояване на факта, че той е апостол каза: "Не видях ли възкръсналия Христос?" Очевидно това е едно от изискванията на апостолството. Някой ме попита: "Има ли апостоли днес?" Е, аз не знам. Аз не мисля, че има в същия смисъл, че те са били в Новия завет. Със сигурност няма никой днес, който може да свидетелства за възкресението като тях.<br/>И поставиха двама, Иосифа, наречен Варсава, който се наричаше Юст, и Матия. И те се помолиха и рекоха: Ти, Господи, който познаваш сърцата на всички човеци, покажи дали от тия двамата, които си избрал,<br/>Мисля, че често правим тази грешка да даваме на Господ два избора, и двата грешни. Ограничаване на Бог, виждате ли. Ние сме толкова склонни да направим това. Очевидно, Павел е бил Божият избор. Питър беше буен и скачайки от пистолета каза: "Хей, трябва да направим нещо, нали знаеш, трябва да помогнем на Бог. Знаеш, един липсва и ние трябва да го запълним." И все пак, "Боже, кой от тези двамата искаш?" И давайки на Бог двата избора.<br/>за да вземе участие в това служение и в това апостолство, от което Юда падна поради престъплението, за да отиде на своето си място. И тъй те раздадоха своя жребий (Деяния 1:25-26);<br/>Интересен начин, по който те се стремяха да определят Божията воля. Да хвърлим зарове, да разберем каква е Божията воля тук. Интересно ми е, различните начини, които хората са измислили, за да различават Божията воля. Сега, в старозаветните времена те имали интересен начин да дойдат при свещеника, който ще се допита до Господ за тях чрез Урим и Тумим, "светлините и съвършенствата." Точно какви са тези Урим и Тумим, не знаем. Сигурен съм, че това не са цветните очила, които Джоузеф Смит е намерил със Златните скрижали; магическите очила, че когато ги сложиш, изведнъж можеш да прочетеш йероглифното писмо.<br/>Има хора, които казват, че Урим и Тумим всъщност били черен и бял камък, който бил носен в торбичка на гърдите на свещеника. Те се молели и задавали на Господа конкретен въпрос. Помниш ли, че Давид задаваше на Господа определени въпроси: "Господи, да излезем ли против филистимците?" Отговорът беше: "Не." И така, на следващия ден: "Господи, да излезем ли против филистимците?" Отговорът беше: "Да." "Кога ще отидем?" Те задавали конкретни въпроси и Господ ги насочвал през Урим и Тумин. Казват, че свещеникът се молил, търсил Бог, а след това се протягал и изваждал един от двата камъка. Ако това бил белият камък, това бил отговорът с "да". Ако беше "не", тогава щеше да е черният камък, който той ще извади. Някои дори казват, че получаваме термина blackballed от този Урим и Тумим. Всъщност, обратно в оригинала е "не" срещу определен проект или идея. Не знаем точно какви са били Урим и Тумим, но през старозаветния период са използвали метод за хвърляне на жребий, за да определят Божията воля.<br/>Така че тук учениците се качват на едно и също нещо, тъй като те хвърлят заровете, за да видят кой от двамата, че Бог е избрал да замени Юда Искариотски.<br/>жребият падна върху Матиас; той бе преброен с единадесетте (Деяния 1:26).<br/>Сега кой в света е Матиас? Никой никога не е чувал за него преди или след това. Ще бъде интересно да се срещне с Матиас и да разберете кой е той и какво е направил. Мисля, че от последващата история е очевидно да се предположи, че Бог е избрал Павел за апостол. Павел го заявява сам. Сега това е последният път, когато четем за тях, които се стремят да разберат Божията воля чрез хвърляне на жребий или случайно нещо такова.<br/>Знам, че един човек днес, в стремежа си да различи волята на Господа, ще се помоли и ще зададе на Господа един въпрос. Той ще има десет пенита в джоба си, и докато се моли, ще вземе пенитата със затворени очи и ще ги сложи на масата, и ако всички излязат глави, това е "да". Интересното е, че от време на време всички излизат с ези-та и това са доста добри шансове. След като Светият Дух дойде върху църквата, тогава Светият Дух започна да им говори и да ги насочва. И Светият Дух каза: "Отделете ми Павел и Варнава за служението, където съм ги призовал" (Деяния 13:2). И Светият Дух ги изпрати. Така че ние намираме църквата по-пряко ръководена от Светия Дух. След като дойде Светият Дух, това хвърляне на зарове, за да се открие Божията воля, беше забравено.<br/>"<br/><br/>King James Версия<br/><br/>Това е версията на крал Джеймс от 1769 г. на Светата Библия (известна още като Оторизираната версия).

In fact, dynamic drivers work exactly the same as dynamic microphones but in reverse. Inside a dynamic driver there is a magnet, and when you plug in the headphones, you are sending a AC current through it which will turn the voice coil into a magnet. Depending on the direction of the current, the polarity of the magnet will change. Now since we know for a magnet, same charges repels and different charges attract, we know that the voice coil will move back and forth depending on it's polarity at the time. The voice coil is attached to the diaphragm which will then move back and forth creating a sound wave. The same occurs in reverse, if you move a coil through a magnet you produce a current instead. Since your voice is pushing the diaphragm, it is moving the voice coil back and forth generating the current you have observed.<br/><br/>100+ Head-Fier<br/><br/>Joined:<br/>Nov 7, 2011<br/><br/>Posts:<br/>134<br/><br/>Likes: 55<br/><br/>Exactly.

Вътре в динамичен драйвер има магнит и когато включите слушалките, през него се изпраща променлив ток, който ще превърне гласовата намотка в магнит. В зависимост от посоката на тока, полярността на магнита ще се промени. Сега, след като знаем за магнит, същите заряди се отблъскват и различни заряди се привличат, знаем, че гласовата намотка ще се движи напред-назад в зависимост от полярността му по това време. Гласовата намотка е прикрепена към диафрагмата, която след това ще се движи напред-назад, създавайки звукова вълна. Същото се случва и в обратна посока, ако преместите намотка през магнит, произвеждате ток вместо това. Тъй като гласът ви натиска диафрагмата, той движи гласовата намотка напред-назад, генерирайки тока, който сте наблюдавали.<br/><br/>100+ Хед-Фиър<br/><br/>Присъединил се:<br/>7 ноември 2011 г.<br/><br/>Постове:<br/>134.<br/><br/>Харесвания: 55<br/><br/>Точно така.

Stalin's opposition within the party, including Bukharin, Yagoda and Rykov were purged in these show trials, as Stalin manipulatively forced them to confess to crimes of planning a coup and opposing the state, even if there was no proof. Gabor T Rittersporn said, "Many of the victims were sincerely devoted to the principles of Bolshevism." This amplifies proof that the Bolshevik ideals that had once been the roots of the Communist Party were being disarranged and destroyed by the Purges. The party was depleted and former members helplessly watched Stalin use the great purge as a tool to transform Russia from a one party state to an unchallenged dictatorship. Again, the purges were shattering the framework of the Communist Party, formed during the Bolshevik revolution. This agrees with the "Stalin the executioner" source as both show the manipulative character, that helped the dictator to enhance his grip on Russia's throat.<br/>The manipulative manner, with which Stalin incriminated his targeted opposition during the purges, in the eyes of everyday Russians, also had an implosive impact on Soviet Society. Stalin was able to collect support from the people through his use of propaganda and the media to help him develop a "cult of personality" and the image of a heroic and brave leader. Through this support Stalin implanted mistrust into the minds of the people, convincing them that traitors of the revolution and what he described as 'enemies of the people', were amongst them.

Опозицията на Сталин в партията, включително Бухарин, Ягода и Райков, са прочистени в тези показни процеси, тъй като Сталин манипулативно ги принуждава да признаят за престъпления, свързани с планиране на преврат и противопоставяне на държавата, дори и да няма доказателства. Габор Титерспорн казва: "Много от жертвите бяха искрено отдадени на принципите на болшевизма." Това усилва доказателството, че болшевишките идеали, които някога са били корени на комунистическата партия, са били разбъркани и унищожени от чистките. Партията е изчерпана и бившите членове безпомощно гледат как Сталин използва великата чистка като инструмент за трансформиране на Русия от еднопартийна държава в неоспорвана диктатура. Отново чистките разбиват рамката на Комунистическата партия, формирана по време на болшевишката революция. Това е в съгласие с източника на "Сталин палача", тъй като и двамата показват манипулативния характер, който помогна на диктатора да засили хватката си върху гърлото на Русия.<br/>Манипулативният начин, с който Сталин инкриминира целенасоченото си противопоставяне по време на чистките, в очите на обикновените руснаци, също оказва имплозивно въздействие върху съветското общество. Сталин успява да събере подкрепа от народа чрез използването на пропаганда и медиите, за да му помогне да развие "култ към личността" и образа на героичен и смел лидер. Чрез тази подкрепа Сталин вложи недоверие в умовете на хората, убеждавайки ги, че предателите на революцията и това, което той описва като "врагове на народа", са сред тях.

| Supercell is nerfing brawlers instead of nerfing star powers. I was at 750 last season with power 8 nita and it is very tough to go past that, like, star powers play a really dominant role. The matchmaking is also trash. When i play gem grab(around 600 trophies), there are often matchups where the enemy team has one more player than us who is maxed and it's not even that we have a lvl 9 to compete versus that. Sometimes there are even matchups where the enemy team is fully maxed and none of us are. this is why i dont play brawl stars seriously anymore. It's not even like there arent many players who are not maxed and around 600 trophies. It's annoying.<br/>Edit: I think supercell should have at least a basic mechanism that takes the average of levels of brawlers when setting up matches.<br/><br/>Except trophies don't really indicate your skill. They indicate the skill of the teammates you are placed with. And I'm fine with playing against higher level brawlers, but when one team is all level 10 and the other team isn't, clearly it's unbalanced.<br/><br/>I reccomend getting some good friends to play with, me and 2 friends got my friends power 1 tick to rank 28 by playing gem grab with a certain composition all day and we made it without a single one of us being maxed with our brawlers.<br/><br/>I Know how you feel I used to have brawlers in high trophies with low level and it's to difficult to go more further and everything I was saying to myself "I want to have star powers" really supercell needs to make balance to the star powers or at least make a better matchmaking system.<br/><br/>I kinda feel this. I ain't as good at the game as you, but I got Emz to 500 at power 1 and the matchmaking was horrible. Maxed out players everywhere! And it didn't help that the majority of my teammates had around 5-8k trophies... I had to resort to solo showdown last minute because I can either ambush unsuspecting players or simply play a little aggressive at the right times. But I really wish that it could be a bit easier for people who want to push brawlers to really high trophy ranges without having the luxury of star powers.<br/><br/>Altho spike is still good without curveball. Curveball was just a help for hitting your shots more often as spike. But even before curveball was released, spike was a really strong brawler, so he will remain the same now.<br/><br/>I agree that they should have nerfed ambush, but I think they are trying to balance both Snappy Sniping and Ambush, as they are both getting merged with this change. She was becoming a little powerful, but still not nerf-worthy<br/><br/>I'm not sure about this, but now that Darryl got a noticeable buff, looking at their new stats, it looks like Darryl might overshadow Bull, as not only he can always deal more damage than Bull, he won't die as early anymore, so their survivability will be similar without star power (although Bull's survivability is still noticeably better than Darryl's if he had Tough Guy). Not only that, Darryl's super can auto regenerate, meaning Darryl MIGHT be able to be played effectively both as a heavyweight AND an assassin at the same time (before he sucks as a heavyweight but decent as an assassin)<br/><br/>But hes overrated af. And you get trophies with him really easily. So im kinda ok with the nerf. I havent even played him since when I got him to 500 (around 5 months ago), so not that I care that much either.<br/><br/>Why doesn't Poco/Penny get a HP nerf, if they are Marksman/Healer respectively not a tank?<br/>Why isn't Rosa's tankyness nerfed, cough 70% damage reduction?<br/>Why is Tick allowed to have the highest range and the most free pokedamage in the entire game?<br/>Why doesn't Leon get a HP/Damage buff?<br/><br/>Be that as it may, it was Ambush that was OP, not base Piper. I would argue that Ambush is the best star power in the game (now even more so since the percentage of damage increase indirectly went up) and base Piper was a bottom-10 brawler.<br/><br/>What Supercell should do is revert both nerfs, reduce Ambush to 600, and reduce Snappy Sniping to 0.25 since it'd be indirectly buffed by the base damage buff.<br/><br/>Yea and I believe they went a bit too far with Rosa, because now she is basically the better bull now when it comes to tanking, which she has been for a while. Now, Darryl might as well be a smaller, more powerful bull<br/><br/>Why? I feel she needs a buff in almost everything except her star power. Her health and speed make her super a bit more difficult to use, because she can die pretty easily, and it is really difficult for her to trap faster brawlers like Crow. Her star power is a bit broken though... | Supercell изнервя свадите, вместо да изнервя звездните сили. Бях на 750 миналия сезон с мощност 8 нита и е много трудно да се премине, че звездните сили играят наистина доминираща роля. Сватовството също е боклук. Когато играя gem grap(около 600 трофея), често има мачове, при които противниковият отбор има един повече играч от нас, който е максиран и дори не е, че имаме 9 лв., за да се състезаваме срещу това. Понякога дори има мачове, в които противниковият отбор е напълно максимиран и никой от нас не е. Ето защо вече не играя сериозно със звезди. Дори няма много играчи, които да не са максимирани и около 600 трофея. Това е досадно.<br/>Редакция: Мисля, че суперклетките трябва да имат поне основен механизъм, който взема средната стойност на нивата на кавгите при настройването на мачовете.<br/><br/>С изключение на трофеите, които не показват уменията ви, те показват уменията на съотборниците, с които сте поставени. И аз съм съгласен да играя срещу кавгаджии от по-високо ниво, но когато единият отбор е на 10-то ниво, а другият не е, очевидно е небалансиран.<br/><br/>Аз препоръчвам получаване на някои добри приятели, с които да играят, аз и 2 приятели имам моите приятели мощност 1 тик да се класира 28, като играят скъпоценен камък вземете с определен състав по цял ден и ние го направихме без нито един от нас да бъде максиран с нашите кавгаджии.<br/><br/>Знам как се чувстваш, преди имах кавги във високи трофеи с ниско ниво и е трудно да отида по-далеч и всичко, което си казвах "Искам да имам звездни сили" наистина суперклетка трябва да направи баланс на звездните сили или поне да направи по-добра система за сватосване.<br/><br/>Усещам това. Не съм толкова добър в играта като теб, но докарах Емц до 500 на първа степен и сватосването беше ужасно. Максирано играчи навсякъде! И това не помогна, че по-голямата част от съотборниците ми имаше около 5-8k трофеи... Трябваше да прибягна до соло шоудаун в последната минута, защото мога или да направя засада на нищо неподозиращите играчи, или просто да играя малко агресивно в правилните моменти. Но наистина ми се иска да е малко по-лесно за хората, които искат да тласнат кавгаджиите към наистина високи трофеи, без да имат лукса на звездните сили.<br/><br/>Altho шип все още е добър без крива топка. Curveball е само помощ за удари вашите снимки по-често като шип. Но още преди крива топка е освободен, шип е наистина силен кавгаджия, така че той ще остане същият сега.<br/><br/>Съгласна съм, че е трябвало да направят засада, но мисля, че се опитват да балансират както Снапи Снайпинг, така и Засада, тъй като и двамата се сливат с тази промяна.<br/><br/>Не съм сигурен за това, но сега, след като Дарил има забележим баф, гледайки новите им статистики, изглежда, че Дарил може да засенчи Бул, тъй като не само, че винаги може да нанесе повече щети от Бул, той няма да умре толкова рано, така че оцеляването им ще бъде подобно без звездна сила (въпреки че оцеляването на Бул все още е забележимо по-добро от това на Дарил, ако имаше Tough Guy). Не само това, супер Дарил може автоматично да се регенерира, което означава, че Дарил може да бъде в състояние да се играе ефективно както като тежка категория, така и като убиец в същото време (преди да суче като тежка категория, но приличен като убиец)<br/><br/>Но той е надценен аф. И получавате трофеи с него наистина лесно. Така че аз съм доста добре с nerf. Аз дори не съм го играл, тъй като когато го стигнах до 500 (преди около 5 месеца), така че не че ми пука, че много.<br/><br/>Защо Поко/Пени не получават HP nerf, ако са съответно Marksman/Healer, а не танк?<br/>Защо цистерната на Роза не е изнервена, кашлицата намалява щетите със 70%?<br/>Защо е позволено на Tick да има най-високия диапазон и най-безплатното pokedamage в цялата игра?<br/>Защо Леон не получи HP/Damage buff?<br/><br/>Както и да е, именно Засада беше ОП, а не база Пайпър. Бих твърдял, че Засада е най-добрата звездна сила в играта (сега още повече, тъй като процентът на щетите се увеличи косвено) и база Пайпър беше дън-10 кавгаджия.<br/><br/>Това, което Supercell трябва да направи, е да върне и двата неврона, да намали Засадата до 600 и да намали Snappy Snipping до 0.25, тъй като ще бъде индиректно запушен от основната повреда.<br/><br/>Да и аз вярвам, че са отишли малко по-далеч с Роза, защото сега тя е основно по-добрият бик сега, когато става въпрос за танкиране, което тя е била за известно време. Сега, Дарил може да бъде по-малък, по-мощен бик<br/><br/>Защо? Чувствам, че се нуждае от бъф в почти всичко, с изключение на звездната си сила. Нейното здраве и скорост я правят супер по-трудна за използване, защото може да умре доста лесно и наистина е трудно за нея да хване в капан по-бързи кавгаджии като Кроу. Нейната звездна сила е малко развалена... |

| Self-Employment Part 1<br/><br/>When you accept an employment in any organisation, you have to perform various jobs as per the requirements of your employer and you may get a fixed amount of income as salary. You may run a small retail shop, tailoring shop, restaurant, bakery and confectionery, beauty salon, etc. in your locality. You may get engaged in trading or manufacturing on a small scale or providing some service for a price. Such economic activities are known as self-employment.<br/><br/>Meaning of Self-Employment<br/><br/>Earning is necessary for a living. Our father, mother, brothers, sisters and others may be engaged in different economic activities through which they earn their livelihood. These persons are engaged in an economic activity which is termed as wage employment or paid employment. But there are many persons who engage themselves in an occupation or some business which they start and manage on their own. They put in their best effort and take all types of risks to pursue their careers successfully. The entire earning of their work goes to them. All of us have seen small grocery shops, tailoring shops, medical stores etc. in our locality. These are owned and managed by a person, with or without the help of some assistants. Their economic activities are termed as self-employment. So, when an individual engages in any economic activity and manages it on his own, it is known as self-employment.<br/><br/>Objectives<br/><br/>After studying this lesson, you will be able to:<br/><br/>Image of Objectives<br/><br/>Image of Objectives<br/><br/>Characteristics of Self-Employment<br/><br/>It involves ownership and management of activities by a person although he/she may take the help of one or two persons to assist him/her. Thus, self-employment may provide employment to other persons as well.<br/><br/>The earning from self-employment is not fixed. It depends on the income one can earn by producing or buying and selling goods or providing services to others at a price.<br/><br/>In self-employment, the owner alone has to take the profit and bear the risk of loss. So, we find a direct link between the effort and reward in self-employment.<br/><br/>It requires some amount of capital investment, although it may be small.<br/><br/>In self-employment, a person is free to take decisions in respect of running his business profitably and avail of any opportunity that may come up for expansion of his business. It gives complete freedom to work as per one's own will and within the parameters of the prevailing laws.<br/><br/>Thus, self-employment may be defined as, an economic activity which one may perform on his own as a gainful occupation, and this may consist of producing and selling goods, buying and selling goods, or rendering services for a price. | Самостоятелно заето лице Част 1<br/><br/>Когато приемете работа в която и да е организация, трябва да изпълнявате различни работни места според изискванията на работодателя си и може да получите фиксиран размер на дохода като заплата.
