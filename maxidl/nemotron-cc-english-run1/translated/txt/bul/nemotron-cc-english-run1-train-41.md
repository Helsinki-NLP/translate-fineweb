| Bacopa<br/><br/>19 Nov 2015<br/>Posted by Doxiderol<br/><br/>Bacopa is a perennial plant that thrives in marshy subtropical and tropical regions around the globe. The highly regarded herb is a key ingredient in Doxiderol, a nutritional supplement that enhances cognitive function. Bacopa was chosen for its ability to protect the brain and increase acetylcholine, a biochemical messenger that enables the nervous system to relay information.<br/><br/>Ayurvedic practitioners first described the therapeutic properties of bacopa in 300 BC. The physicians recorded bacopa's abilities to enhance intelligence and memory. Nearly 2,500 years later, a growing body of modern research confirms the cognitive benefits of bacopa recorded in the Ayurvedic text.<br/><br/>In 1987, researchers in India evaluated the effects of bacopa on the intellectual function of school-aged children. During the four-week study, they administered bacopa to 40 children who were 6 to 8 years old. The scientists determined that bacopa increased perception and memory. The children were able to solve maze exercises quicker and more accurately after receiving bacopa. Many parents in India routinely use bacopa to enhance their children's intellectual development.<br/><br/>A 12-week study published in the August 2001 issue of Psychopharmacology investigated the effects of bacopa on cognitive function. Scientists randomly assigned the healthy volunteers, aged 18 to 65, to receive bacopa or an inactive substance. They also used a double-blind configuration for the study to conceal the identities of the products. Researchers use this design to ensure that the test results are valid because it eliminates bias by the researchers and participants. The bacopa group experienced a significant improvement in the speed at which they were able to process visual information. The participants also learned faster and stored new memories more efficiently.<br/><br/>In 2007, a Texas A&M College of Medicine laboratory study revealed one of the mechanisms responsible for bacopa's ability to promote brain health. According to the scientists, bacopa uses polyphenols to prevent oxidative stress and the damage that it causes to healthy brain cells. Bacopa also reduces harmful deposits of a substance known as beta-amyloid, which is the primary component of the plaque in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease.<br/><br/>A double-blind study published in the July 2008 issue of the Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine evaluated the effect of bacopa on elderly patients. The study confirmed that bacopa increased cognitive performance while reducing stress. According to the authors, the benefits achieved in this study confirmed the results of earlier research.<br/><br/>A 90-day study published in the December 2008 issue of Phytotherapy Research confirms the cognitive benefits that were previously demonstrated in other bacopa studies. Bacopa significantly improved the ability of the participants to temporarily store and use information required for completing a complex task. The double-blind study also demonstrated that bacopa reduced the time required to process visual information.<br/><br/>In addition to enhancing nerve signal transmission, the scientists theorize that bacopa increases cognitive function by reducing anxiety. Numerous studies indicate that anxiety interferes with the ability to perform tasks that require higher-level cognitive functions, such as learning and memorization. Stress disrupts biochemical messengers and healthy nerve signal transmission. Bacopa alleviates stress and restores a sense of calm by increasing acetylcholine levels, which reduces your heart rate and enables you to take deeper breaths.<br/><br/>Doxiderol is a great way to obtain the benefits of bacopa. This holistic supplement also contains other natural ingredients that promote brain health and support your ability to focus and concentrate on complex task as well as memorize information. | Бакопа<br/><br/>19 ноември 2015 г.<br/>Публикувано от Doxidrol<br/><br/>Bacopa е многогодишно растение, което вирее в блатисти субтропични и тропически райони по целия свят. Високо ценената билка е ключова съставка в Doxidrol, хранителна добавка, която подобрява когнитивната функция. Бакопа е избран заради способността си да защитава мозъка и да увеличава ацетилхолина, биохимичен пратеник, който дава възможност на нервната система да предава информация.<br/><br/>Практикуващите аюрведа за първи път описват терапевтичните свойства на бакопа през 300 г. пр.н.е. Лекарите записват способностите на бакопа за повишаване на интелигентността и паметта. Близо 2500 години по-късно все по-голям брой съвременни изследвания потвърждават когнитивните ползи от бакопа, записани в аюрведичния текст.<br/><br/>През 1987 г. изследователи в Индия оценяват ефектите на бакопа върху интелектуалната функция на децата в училищна възраст. По време на четириседмичното проучване те прилагат бакопа на 40 деца, които са на възраст от 6 до 8 години. Учените установили, че бакопа увеличава възприятието и паметта. Децата успели да решат лабиринтните упражнения по-бързо и по-точно, след като получили бакопа. Много родители в Индия рутинно използват бакопа, за да подобрят интелектуалното развитие на децата си.<br/><br/>12-седмично проучване, публикувано в изданието на Psychopharmacology от август 2001 г., изследва ефектите на бакопа върху когнитивната функция. Учените произволно възлагат на здравите доброволци, на възраст от 18 до 65 години, да получават бакопа или неактивно вещество. Те също така използват двойно-сляпа конфигурация за изследването, за да скрият идентичността на продуктите. Изследователите използват този дизайн, за да гарантират, че резултатите от теста са валидни, защото елиминират пристрастията от изследователите и участниците. Групата на бакопа изпитала значително подобрение в скоростта, с която те били в състояние да обработват визуална информация. Участниците също се научили по-бързо и съхранявали нови спомени по-ефективно.<br/><br/>През 2007 г. лабораторно изследване на Texas A&M College of Medicine разкрива един от механизмите, отговорни за способността на бакопа да насърчава здравето на мозъка. Според учените, бакопа използва полифеноли за предотвратяване на оксидативния стрес и щетите, които причинява на здравите мозъчни клетки. Bacopa също така намалява вредните отлагания на вещество, известно като бета-амилоид, което е основният компонент на плаката в мозъка на пациенти с болестта на Алцхаймер.<br/><br/>Двойно-сляпо проучване, публикувано в броя от юли 2008 г. на Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine, оценява ефекта на бакопа върху възрастните пациенти. Проучването потвърждава, че бакопа повишава когнитивните способности, като същевременно намалява стреса. Според авторите ползите, постигнати в това проучване, потвърждават резултатите от по-ранни изследвания.<br/><br/>90-дневно проучване, публикувано в декемврийския брой на Phytotherapy Research, потвърждава когнитивните ползи, които преди това са били демонстрирани в други проучвания на бакопа. Bacopa значително подобри способността на участниците временно да съхраняват и използват информация, необходима за завършване на сложна задача. Двойносляпото проучване също показа, че бакопа намалява времето, необходимо за обработка на визуална информация.<br/><br/>В допълнение към повишаването на предаването на нервния сигнал, учените теоретизират, че бакопа увеличава когнитивната функция чрез намаляване на тревожността. Многобройни проучвания показват, че тревожността пречи на способността за изпълнение на задачи, които изискват когнитивни функции от по-високо ниво, като учене и запаметяване. Стресът нарушава биохимичните пратеници и предаването на здрави нервни сигнали. Bacopa облекчава стреса и възстановява чувството за спокойствие чрез увеличаване на нивата на ацетилхолин, което намалява сърдечната честота и ви позволява да поемате по-дълбоки вдишвания.<br/><br/>Doxidrol е чудесен начин да се получат ползите от бакопа. Тази холистична добавка съдържа и други естествени съставки, които насърчават здравето на мозъка и поддържат способността ви да се фокусирате и да се концентрирате върху сложна задача, както и да запомняте информация. |

She can also sense demonic auras as well as evil auras. When she was born and growing, however, her powers were sealed and she was much less powerful. Since the defeat of the one sealing her powers, Kagome has reached her full potential.<br/><br/>PURIFICATION By making a physical connection, Kagome has the ability to purify both poison and darkness from a subject (living and inanimate). To do so, she projects her spiritual powers through her hand.<br/><br/>SPIRITUAL BARRIERS With her full potential, Kagome has the ability to create a barrier around herself and expand it around others. It is a dome-shaped barrier that can destroy weak demons that make contact with the barrier.<br/><br/>IMPROVED EYESIGHT<br/>Kagome has the ability to see things that are often invisible to the human eye: ghosts, spirits, divine and evil auras.<br/><br/>ABILITIES WITH WEAPONS<br/>Kagome has the ability to use a bow and arrow. She has been self trained, and after years of practice, her arrow rarely misses its mark. Alongside this, Kagome has the ability to infuse her arrows with powers. She can infuse an arrows with her spiritual powers which allows them to penetrate demonic forces, destroy spells, and purify objects. She can infuse her bow with her powers and deflect enemy attacks. She has the ability to infuse her arrows with purifying energy to purify poison as well as powerful, long distant demonic attacks. And, finally, she has the ability to bypass others with her arrow: If her target happens to be behind a barrier or a hostage, the arrow can teleport and hit only her target<br/><br/>The rest of her abilities have become rather unimportant as they are related to time travel (through the Bone Eater's Well), the Shikon Jewel, or her previous incarnation.<br/><br/>the canon<br/><br/>Kagome has been pulled a few days after her high school graduation, however, before the Bone Eater's Well has opened again to allow her to return to the past permanently.<br/><br/>freestyle<br/><br/>memories<br/><br/>かごめ<br/><br/>The sound of her name was a soft whisper in the back of her mind, like a call muffled by the wind. It was the sound of a distant memory, a voice that she had started to forget but desperately clung to all the same. It was her mother's voice, twisted in the sorrow of her lost daughter. Afterall, Kagome banished without a trace. She vividly remembered those moments, the way the day had begun, what she had for breakfast and the last thing she had said to her mother. It was haunting, those memories, because it was like any other time she had slipped between worlds. She had woken, listless, because she had no purpose outside of school. She could find a job, and was scheduled for an interview that day. Her heart hadn't been in it, but it was what she needed to do.<br/><br/>She remembered the feeling of dread, sucking it up and giving herself a pep talk that she could do this. That she could progress in the life that she was meant to now that things had been settled in the past. Of course, she had the lingering feeling that she no longer belonged in her own time or her own life. Not with everything that she had left behind.<br/><br/>Kagome remembered the feeling of the wood beneath her fingers, the way her hand had curled into the handle to slide the door open. She remembered that she paused, turning to her mother with a bright and vibrant smile as she shook herself from her stupor. "I'm taking off." She remembered how strong her voice sounded, the smile on her mother's lips as her eyes shone with pride. Her mother bade her farewell, which didn't seem any different than before but somehow the weight of the words settled in heavier on Kagome's shoulders the more she reflected.<br/><br/>Briefly, the thoughts flickered forward, wondering if her mother worried over her, missed her like she did. Kagome could openly admit that her mother's strength, her support for the fact that her daughter slipped through time so frequently. There were times when she thought herself weak for not having the woman to lean on.<br/><br/>However, she remembered that she did muster up a meager amount of strength.She could remember the shift in the air, the temperature notably different than what she had expected, blinking at the sudden and unfamiliar surroundings. It was not her family's shrine. And when she turned to go back, to slip through the door she had come through, she was met with unfamiliar and cold metal beneath her fingertips and an interior that was not the entrance of her house. A man stood before her, behind a counter, who stared at her with eyes as wide as her own.<br/><br/>She didn't panic, at least. Being torn through time and placed in impossible situations at least built your willpower as far as strange happenings went. Because it wasn't every day that someone found themselves dragged into the past by a demon, intent on ripping a powerful jewel from their body that they didn't even know was there. And then there was the fact that she had shattered said powerful jewel into who knows how many pieces and was tasked on finding them. Such things were not normal, and she had needed to square up and roll with it once she realized that was her reality. It had seemed so simple, just gather the shards and fix the jewel.<br/><br/>But it hadn't been easy, there were many demons after the shards and the jewel itself. And one particularly powerful demon with a wish that he was determined to see fulfilled. To this day, she had never learned his wish but knew it had never been granted even once he had the blasted thing completed. He had ruined so many lives for the sake of nothing. Ruined so many lives for such a futile task. Naraku had been the most difficult foe, and the one who had been the center of everything that had gone wrong in all of her friend's lives.<br/><br/>But, it was that unpredicability, that necessity to roll with what was happening and the willpower that she had gained from her adventure that she remembered drawing upon to come up with a story that fit in the moment that didn't seem too whimsical or far fetched. She needed to be believed, she needed to survive.<br/><br/>Afterall, she faced worse than a man in a camera store. She had lied through her teeth to save her life before.<br/><br/>"I was looking for a job." In the end, it wasn't a complete lie. After all, she had set out of her house with the intent of attending a job interview. Her state of dress would at least attest to that much. It was one of the easier fibs she had ever told.<br/><br/>And, for some reason, that crazy man hired her.<br/><br/>かごめ<br/><br/>Kagomed rolled over in her bed as she pushed back the distant memories, refusing to acknowledge that she was really awake. She clawed at the last glimpses of sleep, begging it to return and to take her back into its embrace. She closed her eyes, willing sleep to come and was only met with memories. The echoes of a song sang in the distance of her memories, a song that had often tormented her, given the same name as her. The voice that sang was no longer reminiscent of her mother, but the voices of children who she had often played with growing up. They called back the memories, even though it had been years since she started this live, even though she was happy in this life, the call of these memories was too loud.<br/><br/>Suddenly, she was falling back into them and sleep evaded her again. She was watching herself in her family's embrace while Inuyasha was pulled back into the well, looking as startled as she had felt. The memories of that moment, those feelings, were still so strong. The feeling of heartbreak and sorrow welled up again though it had been so long since she had felt like she had been ripped away from everything that mattered to her.<br/><br/>Of course her family mattered, and she was happy to be in their arms again. She could never fully, truly describe how she had felt in those days. She still couldn't explain the way she felt split in two, with warring desires to be in both her past and present. She remembered the futile attempts to jump through the well, fingers clawing at the ground in a desperate plea to let her return. The first month home, she didn't sleep so much as she cried.<br/><br/>Elysion had garnished a similar reaction, though it was not so fierce because she didn't know exactly where she had slipped through nor did she know where she could worm her way back. Her explorations were subtle between working her job and trying to settle herself into this life. She had no intentions of staying, no intentions of lingering longer than she needed. And while she didn't try as fiercely as she had when she tried to return to the past, her passion was tenfold because she had no ties to this world. Because she was truly alone… With no hope of anyone to reach her.<br/><br/>In her irrational moments, she thought the Jewel had pulled her back and found a new hell for her to reside in. A new hell that would force her to make a wish, but she remembered very clearly that she had wished it gone forever. That didn't stop her dreams, the times when she woke up in the night sobbing. And those memories of her past were the hardest to deal with, the hardest to forget. Her heart began to race in a panic as she turned in her bed again, her breath became a struggle as she fought against a panic attack induced by her wandering mind this late into the night.<br/><br/>She hated feeling so weak, so afraid.<br/><br/>籠の中の鳥は<br/><br/>Kagome finally pulled herself from bed, her room lit with a pale light that was enough to guide her to the bathroom. She stood before the mirror, the sink running while she stared at her reflection. Raven colored hair covered her face and she felt as bad as she looked. Her first morning in Elysion was similar to this, only she was in worse shape.<br/><br/>She had found a place to sleep, managing to work out a deal with the owner of the building to allow her to stay a small period of time without paying. Perhaps it had been Miroku's influence that allowed her to strike such deals, as the monk was known for his way in charming (or scamming) people into giving them more than enough for the work they had done. The monk had always been that way, since they had first met. He would claim the dwelling of a lord to be haunted when it was not or, claim that they were subject to an attack when they would not be. He would sell his wards and charms for such high prices. It worked practically every time and she wondered why people had been so willing to trust him.<br/><br/>Perhaps it was his smile, or the fact that he was a monk that the people of the past were so willing to crumble. He never preyed on the weak, at least. He always did what was right and he was a symbol of strength to her at times when he would push through everything in order to do what was right. He pushed through the fact that he was dying, that he was cursed, and tried to do something about it rather than wallowing in his fate. He had pushed himself to the limit in the time leading up to their final fight. And she had been glad that they had defeated Naraku before he could become subject to the same fate as his father, and his father before him.<br/><br/>As far as her own charms went, however, she was more fair than her friend and made the deal reasonable. She doubted that anyone in this world would pay a hefty price for an exorcism or banishing demons. They were too technologically advanced for that. But she was clever enough, and smart enough, to make a good deal.<br/><br/>But now, Kagome was in a better place though the look on her face looked the same. Haunted, tired, drained...<br/><br/>A quick glance at a clock on the wall told her that she could try to sleep longer. But she opted out of that, not wanting to face the flashbacks again. She took a shower instead, using the cold water to chase away her demons, to fill her lungs with a sharp intake of breath and force herself awake.<br/><br/>いついつ出やる<br/><br/>It didn't work.<br/><br/>Not in the way she was wanting. The cold water certainly forced the air into her lungs, forced her mind to wake and muscles to seize. A bitter laugh was pulled from her lips as she tilted her head back and found herself remembering more. Today, she wasn't going to escape them so easily. She wasn't going to recover so simply, to recover just because she willed it.<br/><br/>Sometimes, there's no avoiding the thoughts you wanted to. Even when you were certain that you were past them.<br/><br/>Sango would have been a great help in this situation. The demon slayer was her best friend, she would even go as far as to call her the sister that she never had. An older sister who was wise, always had her side when trouble arose. Particularly boy trouble, when such things were rather trivial but it was fun to have a crush and for her friend to be mad on her behalf when Inuyasha made her sad. After all, it had been often that the half-demon would run to his dead lover's side and break her heart more than once.<br/><br/>But, Sango also inspired her in other ways. After all the woman had faced, she had always been so strong, so sure... Even in the times that she had doubted herself, she always pulled through. She admired that she had the ability to survive after losing her whole family -- the reminder of this often pushed Kagome to survive, because she lost everyone to this world -- and then having her brother become a pawn of Naraku. It wasn't easy, couldn't have been something to that just anyone could face and still go forward with. She still smiled, even with that pain and those reminders... She was often so bright, even in the darker times.<br/><br/>And right now, she wanted to lean into the older woman's side, to take comfort in the fact that she was there and she was supportive. She felt that Sango would somehow pull through this, and offer some words of strength and understanding. It was times like these that made these spells worse, the constant reminder that she was without her family.<br/><br/>"I don't want to be alone." She cried aloud in her solitude, the sound of the shower drowning out the plea.<br/><br/>She wasn't afraid to admit it.<br/><br/>夜明けの晩に<br/><br/>Another hour had slipped by before she had realized it. Her skin was cold from the water and it felt like ice ran through her veins. She hadn't realized she had begun to shiver until her hand reached to turn off the water and end her shower. Kagome didn't seek her own gaze in the mirror again, instead, she wrapped herself in towels and trudged out of the bathroom, up the stairs and into her kitchen. She started on making a light breakfast, idly reading through her notes for the day as the food cooked.<br/><br/>Her career was really taking off these last years. Her photos were featured in many galleries, her name started to frequent many lips for those who were interested in photography.<br/><br/>The job she had asked for on a whim had sparked it all. She had been far more lucky than she had expected to be in this world. Never lucky enough to slip back through the cracks into her own world, but lucky enough to do well. As she turned back to the stove, she remembered the time she had finally given up on returning home. It was about two years into her life here, as she had started to venture into photography as more than just a hobby but something she could make a name for herself with.<br/><br/>That day had been particularly pleasant, the sun was high in the sky and she had found herself taking some photos of the natural scenery. A little boy had hidden in one of the plants, and she had caught a picture of the moment his face had settled into a cheerful, mischievous grin the moment before he had jumped out to startle his prey. It reminded her of Shippou, the little kitsune she had, essentially, adopted. He, too, had been torn from his family when they had first met. His father killed and he was determined to avenge him. While young, he did seem so mature in their first encounters.<br/><br/>Maybe it had been the influence of Inuyasha that allowed the kit to act like a kid again, to be young and whimsical at times while others he was more mature. He offered comfort to her in his own way, and she tried to care for him as she would her own though she had been so young then as well. However, her youth did not stop her from understanding how to tend to him or care for him like her child. Her heart swelled when he smiled, when he had been so happy for his gift of crayons and took the time to make art. She was so proud of each drawing that he had finished that she knew that this was how a mother would feel in such a situation.<br/><br/>The pain that had ripped through her was too much, too sudden. She missed him and wanted to see how much he had grown since she had been gone. She had missed so much...<br/><br/>To spare herself any further pain, any false hopes… She gave up. And focused on bettering herself.<br/><br/>鶴と亀が<br/><br/>Breakfast tasted bland, boring, and inspired. Only after she had finished did she realized she had forgotten to any sort of spices or flavor to the food. It was too late now to remember that much, as her mind was too busy remembering other details of her life that clearly had become more important than her food.<br/><br/>"Sit!"<br/><br/>Of course, nothing happened when she had angrily yelled at one particularly frustrating client that reminded her of the half-demon. He was being particularly stubborn and rude, wanting a photo taken his way rather than letting it work out naturally. You could try to force wild animals to behave how you wanted. But, rarely did anyone succeed with force. Inuyasha wasn't as bad, however. Inuyasha had learned before she had been forced away from him. He had become gentler, more understanding, more mature though there were times he was still childish and cocky.<br/><br/>She remember how red her cheeks had burned, but how she stood her ground and fired him. She told him she refused to work for anyone or with anyone who wanted to twist something beyond it's nature, beyond it's own desires.<br/><br/>She should have compared the man to Naraku rather than Inuyasha. Though her client did not have such extreme intentions. At least the feeling afterwards was a pleasant memory. The freedom of knowing that she had come so far that she could refuse work that she didn't want to do, to be her own person that was independent of others. She could say that she made it at that point. Even though she heard rumors days later with words meant to slander her.<br/><br/>She defended herself righteously, like she did towards the end of her journey. After all, she was the only one who could protect herself in this world.<br/><br/>滑った<br/><br/>Morning light began to creep into her home, reminding her again of the passage of time. Again, she considered the list of things she had to do and debated on where to start. Or, if she should even start at all. With how the day began, she didn't know if she could consider that a great idea. It was doubtful that she would be successful with how lost in herself she was becoming.<br/><br/>She didn't want to mess up her latest work. Because she had done that on a few occasions before. It wasn't pleasant to try and recover from a complete disaster.<br/><br/>Kagome remembered the feeling of her expensive, brand new, camera slipping from her hands. She wasn't prepared to support it, because she had just removed it from her bag. Part of her screamed on the inside. A dramatic, over-the-top, full on scream that she frequently did when she was much, much younger. When she was struggling to make it through middle school while hopping between times. The other part of her had remained frozen in place while her lense completely shattered and the rest of the camera had broken along with it.<br/><br/>Seeing Inuyasha's brother, a full demon, standing before her was the last thing she expected when she had made her way out for her photos. He stood as proud as ever, as tall as ever, as imposing as she remembered. He didn't look fazed at all to be in an entirely different world, though she was never the best at reading his mind. His name on her lips was so potent, that she could remember the tiniest feelings as she did. Her lips were chapped, her mouth felt dry, and the bubbling feeling of anxiety in her stomach made her feel sick.<br/><br/>She didn't want her hopes to be up.<br/><br/>But, she wanted him to be there, even if they were not friends. They were allies, if anything, since they had fought side by side. And something was better than absolutely nothing.<br/><br/>And Kagome had the sense enough not to throw herself at him, to wrap her arms around him in relief that knowing she was not alone. Her camera no longer mattered when she approached him. She remembered that nothing else mattered for days as she spent time with him, not speaking of their world but speaking (or, she was speaking and he simply acknowledged that fact).<br/><br/>When, exactly, she fell for him though… Kagome couldn't recall. It was a subtle thing, just like he was. But she knew the feeling was there. And he let her know that she was not alone in the fact that she had fallen, that feelings had somehow blossomed.<br/><br/>後ろの正面<br/><br/>A feeling of weightlessness overtook her and suddenly her eyes opened while her mind desperately clawed for the last thing she was doing. She didn't recall when she had fallen asleep on her couch, but she knew the last place she had been was on the far too comfortable cushions. She didn't struggle, however, or fight the weightlessness as she was in familiar arms. Her head tilted against Sesshoumaru's chest, taking comfort in the fact that he was here and she wasn't alone.<br/><br/>"Welcome back." His response was a soft hum in acknowledgement. He didn't need to speak much for her to understand his intent, or the rest of what he had to say.<br/><br/>He carried her back to her bed, settled her into it with ease. Her eyes met his and she smiled easily because no more memories drifted back, no more recollections teased at her. No, whenever he was near, she never fell back into those thoughts. He had helped, and the years had helped. Today was just… One of those days.<br/><br/>"Sleep." He commanded with ease, her eyes rolled at him but she did not fight because she was tired. Her hand clung tightly to him, while she felt his opposite hand press to her forehead in assessment of her wellbeing.<br/><br/>"I'm okay," she said, her words firm with her promise.<br/><br/>She was okay. She was alive. And she was happy.<br/><br/>だあれ<br/><br/>shipper<br/><br/>summary<br/><br/>Kagome, at one point in her life, was a rather regular teenage girl until she was attacked by a demon inside her family's well house. The demon dragged her down into the well, which magically transported her about 500 years into the past. There, she learned that a sacred jewel was encased inside her body as she was the reincarnation of a priestess that had died 50 years prior to the time she was dragged into. The jewel was ripped from her body and the demon that dragged her through time was defeated by the half-demon that she freed who was pinned to the tree. Kagome befriended the half-demon, Inuyasha, in time and traveled with him to restore the jewel that she, herself, shattered. Though it was not so straightforward and easy to do as many demons and humans sought the jewel for their own purposes. She befriended a young kitsune demon, a monk, and a demon slayer who all traveled with her to restore the jewel.<br/><br/>Her group, however, was not the one to complete the jewel. Instead, an evil half-demon who manipulated the majority of the major events in most of her companion's lives. When he finally collected all the pieces of the jewel and made his wish on the tainted object, Kagome was drawn into the jewel itself with the intent of her making a selfish wish to keep her trapped inside forever, keeping the jewel alive. It was the stubbornness of Inuyasha that managed to save her from the darkness. In the end, she returned to her natural time, finished high school as was expect from a girl of her timeline. Though days later, Kagome ended up in Elysion. She has been in this world for five years, and has long since given up on returning home. She's settled happily into her new life.<br/><br/>platonic<br/><br/>It's rather easy for Kagome to make new friends, she hasn't changed much from her youth. She is a cheerful young woman who is empathetic and welcoming to most of all in her life. In her youth, she befriended demons when most would fear them. Even demons that used to eat humans, she has befriended and she changed their ways (she'd like to think). This being said, it's really easy to become her friend as long as someone is able to shown that they are willing to be redeemed, or show that they are not completely evil. She feels greatly for everyone she meets, so it's hard for her not to be drawn to others in a desire to be friends.<br/><br/>antagonistic<br/><br/>The only way to earn Kagome's wrath is to be so deplorable, so evil, and so far beyond redemption that she can't see any good in you. And she can see the good in pretty much everyone and everything. Honestly, with whom she has faced? A half-demon that pitted two lovers against each other, that cursed the entire male line of one of her friends, and then had her best friend's brother kill their family… Yeah, I don't see her hating anyone without them really, really working for it. Feel free to give it a shot, though.<br/><br/>romantic<br/><br/>When in love, Kagome is a strong support, always staying there even when things may be rough. However, Kagome is not looking for love, wasn't looking for love when she arrived so any past relationships don't exist. This isn't to say that someone hasn't fallen in love with her. She can definitely be the subject of someone's unrequited love, she'll probably be oblivious about it, though. Finally, Kagome is currently engaged to Sesshoumaru, surprisingly. I'm totally open to potential AU things, though. <3<br/><br/>fandom hell<br/><br/>age ancient<br/><br/>species space queen<br/><br/>occupation dying<br/><br/>prefers she/her<br/><br/>awards<br/><br/>pro<br/>she/her est 62woo i suck at plot replies. but ok anyway!!! neptune is very friendly and has that 'cool' persona, he's really fun to be around, and he's SUPER good to work with. like he's super patient and he'll do anything she asks of him--he's really easy to work with, definitely in comparison to other models. so i love the idea of them being all work oriented friends at first and then turning into something more. neptune definitely tries to surround himself with people, because he loves having friends, and kagome is pretty much his type too? like she's sweet and she's a strong woman, and he is actually better friends with women than he is with men, idk why, he just loves being surrounded by female friends who knows. i love my guys being super good friends and protecting their girl friends honestly. but oh M A N i love pseduo-family type relationships and neptune is an only child, so he hasn't had any like, familial relationships like that. so her looking out for him all big sister like would make him be like ????? cause he's confused but also he actually really likes that LOL! they're both good kids, i think they'd be really fun ^^<br/><br/>fandom fire emblem: fates<br/><br/>age ninteen<br/><br/>species Part human / part dragon<br/><br/>occupation representative guardian<br/><br/>prefers she/her<br/><br/>awards<br/><br/>yonder<br/>she/her aest 20 posts<br/><br/>I haven't seen Inuyasha at all but... from what I've read Kagome seems to be one of those people who might be able to help Corrin out with her emotional state. There's a lot weighing on her mind since she had to fight her birth family against her will and last time she saw them they all pretty much hated her. Frankly she hasn't worked through everything yet since she was essentially at the head of a full-scale war. I feel they could be friends as Corrin is quite open in her personality, extremely trusting as well. She's just... hiding and struggling through a lot.

I love your idea of Kagome taking a pic of Elsa! You know, she's also a singer/performer at a local theater so I can imagine Kagome going there to scope things out and then catching Elsa backstage or something--and then the friendship could blossom from there!

Тя също може да усеща демонични аури, както и зли аури. Когато се ражда и расте, обаче, силите й са запечатани и тя е много по-малко могъща. След поражението на този, който запечатва силите й, Кагоме достига пълния си потенциал.<br/><br/>ЧИСТАВАНЕ Чрез осъществяване на физическа връзка, Кагоме има способността да пречиства както отровата, така и тъмнината от субекта (жив и неодушевен). За да направи това, тя проектира своите духовни сили чрез ръката си.<br/><br/>С пълния си потенциал, Кагоме има способността да създава бариера около себе си и да я разширява около другите. Това е куполообразна бариера, която може да унищожи слабите демони, които влизат в контакт с бариерата.<br/><br/>ПОДОБРЯВАНЕ НА ОЧИТЕ<br/>Кагоме има способността да вижда неща, които често са невидими за човешкото око: призраци, духове, божествени и зли аури.<br/><br/>ДРУЖЕСТВА С ОРЪЖИЕ<br/>Кагоме има способността да използва лък и стрела. Тя е самообучена и след години практика, нейната стрела рядко пропуска своя знак. Наред с това, Кагоме има способността да напоява стрелите си със сили. Тя може да влее стрели с духовните си сили, което им позволява да проникват в демонични сили, да унищожават заклинания и да пречистват предмети. Тя може да влее лъка си със силите си и да отклонява вражеските атаки. Тя има способността да влива стрелите си с пречистваща енергия, за да пречиства отровата, както и мощни, далечни демонични атаки. И накрая, тя има способността да заобикаля другите със стрелката си: Ако целта й се случи да бъде зад бариера или заложник, стрелката може да се телепортира и да удари само целта си.<br/><br/>Останалите й способности са станали доста маловажни, тъй като са свързани с пътуване във времето (през кладенеца на костоядните), шиконското бижу или предишното й въплъщение.<br/><br/>Канонът<br/><br/>Кагоме е изтеглена няколко дни след дипломирането си в гимназията, обаче, преди кладенецът на костоядните да се отвори отново, за да й позволи да се върне в миналото за постоянно.<br/><br/>свободен стил<br/><br/>спомени<br/><br/>- Да.<br/><br/>Звукът на името й беше мек шепот в задната част на съзнанието й, като зов, заглушен от вятъра. Това беше звукът на далечен спомен, глас, който тя беше започнала да забравя, но отчаяно се придържаше към всичко това. Това беше гласът на майка й, изкривен от мъката на изгубената й дъщеря. В крайна сметка Кагоме прогони без следа. Тя ярко си спомни онези моменти, начина, по който денят беше започнал, какво яде за закуска и последното нещо, което беше казала на майка си. Тя беше натрапчива, тези спомени, защото беше като всеки друг път, когато се беше подхлъзнала между световете. Тя се беше събудила, безпомощна, защото нямаше цел извън училище. Тя можеше да си намери работа и беше насрочена за интервю този ден. Сърцето й не беше в него, но тя имаше нужда да го направи.<br/><br/>Спомни си чувството на ужас, смучейки го и давайки си агитация, че може да направи това, че може да напредне в живота, на който е била предопределена, сега, когато нещата са били уредени в миналото. Разбира се, тя имаше чувството, че вече не принадлежи нито на собственото си време, нито на собствения си живот, не и с всичко, което е оставила след себе си.<br/><br/>Кагоме си спомни усещането за дървото под пръстите си, начина, по който ръката й се беше свила в дръжката, за да плъзне вратата отворена. Тя си спомни, че е направила пауза, обръщайки се към майка си с ярка и жизнена усмивка, докато се разклащаше от ступор. "Аз изчезвам." Спомни си колко силен беше гласът й, усмивката на устните на майка й, когато очите й блестяха от гордост. Майка й се сбогуваше, което не изглеждаше по-различно от преди, но някак си тежестта на думите се уталожи в по-тежки върху раменете на Кагоме, колкото повече се отразяваше.<br/><br/>Накратко, мислите проблеснаха напред, чудейки се дали майка й се тревожеше за нея, липсваше й като нея. Кагоме можеше открито да признае, че силата на майка й, нейната подкрепа за факта, че дъщеря й се подхлъзна през времето толкова често. Имало е моменти, когато се е смятала за слаба, защото не е имала жената, на която да се облегне.<br/><br/>Тя обаче си спомни, че е събрала оскъдна сила. Тя можеше да си спомни промяната във въздуха, температурата значително по-различна от това, което беше очаквала, мигайки при внезапното и непознато обкръжение. И когато се обърна да се върне, да се промъкне през вратата, през която беше минала, тя беше посрещната с непознат и студен метал под пръстите си и интериор, който не беше входът на къщата й. Пред нея стоеше мъж, зад тезгяха, който я гледаше с очи, широки колкото нейните.<br/><br/>Поне не се е паникьосала, защото е била разкъсвана във времето и поставяна в невъзможни ситуации, поне е изградила волята ти, доколкото са се случвали странни неща. Защото не всеки ден някой се озовава въвлечен в миналото от демон, възнамеряващ да откъсне мощно бижу от тялото си, за което дори не са знаели, че е там. И тогава се появи фактът, че тя беше разбила каза мощно бижу в кой знае колко парчета и е натоварена със задачата да ги намери. Такива неща не бяха нормални и тя трябваше да се изправи и да се търкаля с него, след като тя осъзна, че това е нейната реалност. Изглеждаше толкова просто, просто съберете парчетата и поправете бижуто.<br/><br/>Но не беше лесно, имаше много демони след парчетата и самото бижу и един особено силен демон с желание, което той беше решен да види изпълнено. И до днес тя така и не бе научила желанието му, но знаеше, че то никога не е било изпълнявано, дори и след като той беше завършил проклетото нещо. Той беше съсипал толкова много животи в името на нищо. Съсипа толкова много животи за такава безсмислена задача. Нараку беше най-трудният враг и този, който беше в центъра на всичко, което се бе объркало в живота на приятелката й.<br/><br/>Но именно тази непредсказуемост, тази необходимост да се търкаля с това, което се случваше, и силата на волята, която беше придобила от приключението си, тя си спомни, че рисува, за да излезе с история, която се вписваше в момента, който не изглеждаше твърде причудлив или далечен. Трябваше да й се вярва, трябваше да оцелее.<br/><br/>В края на краищата, тя се изправи пред по-лошо от мъж в магазин за фотоапарати. Тя беше излъгала през зъбите си, за да спаси живота си преди.<br/><br/>"Търсех си работа." В крайна сметка това не беше пълна лъжа. В края на краищата тя беше излязла от къщата си с намерението да присъства на интервю за работа. Състоянието на облеклото й поне щеше да свидетелства за това. Това беше една от най-лесните лъжи, които някога е казвала.<br/><br/>И по някаква причина този луд я е наел.<br/><br/>- Да.<br/><br/>Кагомед се претърколи в леглото си, докато отблъскваше далечните спомени, отказвайки да признае, че наистина е будна. Тя се вкопчи в последните проблясъци на съня, молейки го да се върне и да я приеме обратно в прегръдките си. Тя затвори очи, желаейки да заспи и бе посрещната само със спомени. Ехото на една песен пееше в далечината на спомените си, песен, която често я измъчваше, получаваше същото име като нея. Гласът, който пееше, вече не напомняше на майка й, а на гласовете на децата, с които тя често си играеше, докато растеше. Те върнаха спомените, въпреки че бяха минали години, откакто тя започна този живот, въпреки че беше щастлива в този живот, призивът на тези спомени беше твърде силен.<br/><br/>Изведнъж тя се връщаше в тях и сънят отново я избягваше. Тя се наблюдаваше в прегръдката на семейството си, докато Инуяша беше издърпана обратно в кладенеца, изглеждайки толкова стресната, колкото се беше почувствала. Спомените от онзи момент, тези чувства, все още бяха толкова силни. Чувството на разбито сърце и скръб отново се надигна, въпреки че беше минало толкова време, откакто тя се чувстваше сякаш е била откъсната от всичко, което имаше значение за нея.<br/><br/>Разбира се, семейството й имаше значение и тя беше щастлива, че отново е в ръцете им. Тя никога не можеше напълно, истински да опише как се е чувствала в онези дни. Тя все още не можеше да обясни как се чувства разделена на две, с враждуващи желания да бъде както в миналото си, така и в настоящето. Тя си спомни за безплодните опити да скочи през кладенеца, с пръсти, които драскаха по земята в отчаяна молба да я върнат. Първият месец у дома тя не спеше толкова, колкото плачеше.<br/><br/>Елисион бе гарнирала подобна реакция, макар че не беше толкова свирепа, защото не знаеше точно къде се е промъкнала, нито пък знаеше къде може да се върне. Нейните изследвания бяха едва доловими между работата й и опитите да се установи в този живот. Тя нямаше никакви намерения да остане, никакви намерения да се задържи по-дълго, отколкото се нуждаеше. И макар да не се опитваше толкова яростно, колкото когато се опитваше да се върне в миналото, страстта й беше десетократно по-голяма, защото нямаше връзки с този свят, защото беше наистина сама... без надежда някой да я достигне.<br/><br/>В ирационалните си моменти тя мислеше, че бижуто я е издърпало и е намерило нов ад, в който да живее. Нов ад, който ще я принуди да си пожелае нещо, но тя си спомни много ясно, че е искала то да си отиде завинаги. Това не спря сънищата й, моментите, когато се събуждаше плачейки през нощта и тези спомени от миналото й бяха най-трудни за справяне, най-трудни за забравяне. Сърцето й започна да се втурва в паника, когато тя отново се обърна в леглото си, дъхът й се превърна в борба, тъй като тя се бори срещу паническа атака, предизвикана от нейния скитащ ум толкова късно през нощта.<br/><br/>Мразеше да се чувства толкова слаба, толкова уплашена.<br/><br/>- Да.<br/><br/>Кагоме най-накрая се измъкна от леглото, стаята й светна с бледа светлина, която беше достатъчна, за да я насочи към банята. Тя стоеше пред огледалото, мивката тичаше, докато се взираше в отражението си. Гарван боядисана коса покриваше лицето си и тя се чувстваше толкова зле, колкото тя изглеждаше. Първата си сутрин в Elysion беше подобна на това, само че тя беше в по-лошо състояние.<br/><br/>Тя беше намерила място за спане, успявайки да сключи сделка със собственика на сградата, за да й позволи да остане за кратък период от време, без да плаща. Може би именно влиянието на Мироку й е позволило да сключва такива сделки, тъй като монахът е бил известен с начина си да очарова (или да измами) хората, за да им даде повече от достатъчно за работата, която са свършили. Монахът винаги е бил такъв, откакто са се срещнали за първи път. Той би твърдял, че жилището на господаря е обитавано от духове, когато не е било, или, твърдейки, че те са били обект на нападение, когато не биха били. Той би продавал своите отделения и талисмани на толкова високи цени. Тя работеше практически всеки път и се чудеше защо хората са толкова склонни да му се доверят.<br/><br/>Може би беше усмивката му, или фактът, че е монах, че хората от миналото са били толкова готови да се разпаднат. Той никога не е плячкосвал слабите, най-малко. Той винаги правеше това, което е правилно и беше символ на сила за нея в моменти, когато той щеше да прокара през всичко, за да направи това, което е правилно. Той прокара през факта, че умира, че е прокълнат, и се опита да направи нещо по въпроса, вместо да се въргаля в съдбата си. Той се беше тласнал до краен предел във времето, водещо до последната им битка. И тя се радвала, че са победили Нараку, преди той да може да стане обект на същата съдба като баща си и баща си преди него.<br/><br/>Що се отнася до чара й обаче, тя била по-справедлива от приятеля си и направила сделката разумна. Тя се съмнявала, че всеки на този свят ще плати висока цена за екзорсизъм или прогонване на демони. Те били твърде технологично напреднали за това. Но тя беше достатъчно умна и достатъчно умна, за да направи добра сделка.<br/><br/>Но сега Кагоме беше на по-добро място, въпреки че изражението на лицето й изглеждаше същото.<br/><br/>Един бърз поглед към часовника на стената й каза, че може да се опита да спи по-дълго. Но тя се отказа от това, не искаше да се изправи отново пред ретроспекциите. Вместо това тя си взе душ, използвайки студената вода, за да прогони демоните си, да напълни дробовете си с остър дъх и да се събуди.<br/><br/>- Да.<br/><br/>Не се получи.<br/><br/>Не по начина, по който тя искаше. Студената вода със сигурност принуди въздуха в дробовете си, принуди ума си, за да се събуди и мускули, за да се възползват. Горчив смях бе изтеглен от устните си, тъй като тя наклонена главата си назад и установи, че си спомня повече. Днес нямаше да им избяга толкова лесно, нямаше да се възстанови толкова просто, да се възстанови само защото го е пожелала.<br/><br/>Понякога не можеш да отбягваш мислите, които си искал, дори когато си бил сигурен, че си ги минал.<br/><br/>Санго би била от голяма помощ в тази ситуация. Убийцата на демони беше най-добрата й приятелка, тя дори би стигнала толкова далеч, че да я нарече сестрата, която никога не е имала. По-голяма сестра, която е била мъдра, винаги е била на нейна страна, когато са възникнали неприятности. Особено момчешки проблеми, когато такива неща бяха доста тривиални, но беше забавно да има увлечение и приятелката й да е ядосана от нейно име, когато Инуяша я натъжи. В края на краищата, често се случваше полу-демонът да изтича до мъртвата си любима и да разбие сърцето ? повече от веднъж.<br/><br/>Но Санго я вдъхновяваше и по други начини. След всичко, с което се беше сблъскала жената, тя винаги беше толкова силна, толкова сигурна... Дори във времената, когато се съмняваше в себе си, тя винаги се измъкваше. Възхищавала се, че има способността да оцелява, след като е загубила цялото си семейство - напомнянето за това често подтиквало Кагоме да оцелее, защото тя е загубила всички в този свят - и след това да превърне брат си в пионка на Нараку. Не беше лесно, не можеше да бъде нещо, с което всеки може да се изправи и да продължи напред. Тя все още се усмихваше, дори с тази болка и тези напомняния... Тя често беше толкова ярка, дори в по-тъмните времена.<br/><br/>И точно сега, тя искаше да се облегне на страната на по-възрастната жена, да се успокои от факта, че тя е там и я подкрепя. Тя почувства, че Санго по някакъв начин ще се справи с това, и да предложи някои думи на сила и разбиране. В такива моменти тези заклинания ставали по-лоши, постоянното напомняне, че тя е без семейството си.<br/><br/>"Аз не искам да бъда сам." Тя извика високо в самотата си, звукът на душ удавяне на пледоарията.<br/><br/>Тя не се страхуваше да го признае.<br/><br/>- Да.<br/><br/>Още един час се беше подхлъзнал, преди да го осъзнае. Кожата й беше студена от водата и сякаш през вените й течеше лед. Не беше осъзнала, че е започнала да трепери, докато ръката й не се протегна, за да изключи водата и да приключи душът си. Кагоме отново не потърси собствения си поглед в огледалото, вместо това тя се уви в кърпи и се измъкна от банята, нагоре по стълбите и в кухнята си. Тя започна да прави лека закуска, безразсъдно четейки бележките си за деня, докато храната се приготвяше.<br/><br/>Нейната кариера наистина се развиваше през последните години. Нейните снимки бяха включени в много галерии, името й започна да се среща често с много устни за тези, които се интересуваха от фотография.<br/><br/>Работата, която беше поискала по прищявка, беше предизвикала всичко. Тя беше много по-щастлива, отколкото се очакваше да бъде на този свят. Никога не бе имала достатъчно късмет да се промъкне обратно през пукнатините в собствения си свят, но достатъчно късмет, за да се справи добре. Докато се връщаше към печката, тя си спомни за времето, когато най-накрая се беше отказала да се върне у дома. Беше около две години от живота й тук, тъй като тя беше започнала да се впуска във фотографията като нещо повече от хоби, но нещо, с което можеше да си създаде име.<br/><br/>Този ден беше особено приятен, слънцето беше високо в небето и тя се бе озовала да прави някои снимки на естествената природа. Едно малко момче се беше скрило в едно от растенията и тя бе уловила снимка на момента, в който лицето му се беше настанило в весела, палава усмивка в момента, преди да скочи, за да стресне плячката си. Това й напомняло за Шиппоу, малката китсуне, която по същество била осиновила. Той също бил откъснат от семейството си, когато се срещнали за първи път. Баща му убил и той бил решен да отмъсти за него. Докато бяха млади, той изглеждаше толкова зрял в първите им срещи.<br/><br/>Може би именно влиянието на Инуяша е позволило на комплекта да се държи като дете отново, да бъде млад и причудлив на моменти, докато другите са по-зрели. Той й предложи утеха по свой начин и тя се опита да се грижи за него, както би се грижила за себе си, въпреки че беше толкова млада тогава. Въпреки това нейната младост не я спря да разбере как да се грижи за него или да се грижи за него като за свое дете. Сърцето й се подуваше, когато той се усмихваше, когато той беше толкова щастлив за подаръка си от пастели и отделяше време да прави изкуство. Тя беше толкова горда с всяка рисунка, че той беше завършил, че знаеше, че така ще се чувства една майка в такава ситуация.<br/><br/>Болката, която я беше разкъсала, беше твърде много, твърде внезапна. Липсваше й и искаше да види колко е пораснал, откакто я няма. Толкова много й липсваше...<br/><br/>За да си спести по-нататъшна болка, фалшиви надежди... тя се отказа и се съсредоточи върху подобряването на себе си.<br/><br/>- Да.<br/><br/>Закуската вкусваше скучно, скучно и вдъхновено. Едва след като приключи, тя осъзна, че е забравила за всякакви подправки или вкус към храната. Вече беше твърде късно да си спомня това, тъй като умът й беше твърде зает да си спомня други подробности от живота си, които очевидно бяха станали по-важни от храната й.<br/><br/>Седни!<br/><br/>Разбира се, нищо не се случи, когато тя ядосано се развика на един особено разочароващ клиент, който й напомняше за полудемон. Той беше особено упорит и груб, искаше снимка, направена по пътя му, вместо да остави нещата да се получат естествено. Можеше да се опиташ да принудиш дивите животни да се държат както искаш. Но рядко някой успяваше със сила. Инуяша обаче не беше толкова лоша. Инуяша се беше научила, преди да бъде принудена да се отдалечи от него. Беше станал по-нежен, по-разбиращ, по-зрял, макар че имаше моменти, когато все още беше детински и самонадеян.<br/><br/>Тя си спомняше колко червени бяха бузите й, но как стоеше на земята и го уволни. Тя му каза, че отказва да работи за никого или с всеки, който иска да извърти нещо извън природата си, отвъд собствените си желания.<br/><br/>Тя трябваше да сравни мъжа с Нараку, а не с Инуяша. Въпреки че клиентът й нямаше такива крайни намерения. Поне усещането след това беше приятен спомен. Свободата да знае, че е стигнала толкова далеч, че може да откаже работа, която не иска да върши, да бъде своя собствена личност, която е независима от другите. Въпреки че е чула слухове дни по-късно с думи, които са имали за цел да я оклеветят.<br/><br/>Тя се защитаваше праведно, както го правеше към края на пътуването си. В края на краищата, тя беше единствената, която можеше да се защити в този свят.<br/><br/>- Да.<br/><br/>Сутрешната светлина започна да се промъква в дома й, напомняйки й отново за отминаването на времето. Отново обмисляше списъка с неща, които трябваше да направи и обсъждаше откъде да започне. Или, ако изобщо трябва да започне. Когато денят започваше, тя не знаеше дали може да приеме това за страхотна идея.<br/><br/>Тя не искаше да обърка последната си работа, защото го беше правила няколко пъти преди, не беше приятно да се опитва да се възстанови от пълна катастрофа.<br/><br/>Кагоме си спомни усещането за скъпата си, чисто нова камера, която се изплъзваше от ръцете й. Тя не беше готова да я подкрепи, защото току-що я беше махнала от чантата си. Част от нея крещеше отвътре. Драматичен, над най-горния, пълен с крясъци, който тя често правеше, когато беше много, много по-млада, когато се бореше да премине през средното училище, докато подскачаше между времената. Другата част от нея беше останала замръзнала на място, докато лещата й беше напълно разбита, а останалата част от камерата се беше счупила заедно с нея.<br/><br/>Виждайки брата на Инуяша, пълен демон, застанал пред нея, беше последното нещо, което тя очакваше, когато се беше измъкнала за снимките си. Той стоеше толкова горд, колкото винаги, толкова висок, колкото и внушителен, както тя си спомняше. Той изобщо не изглеждаше смутен да бъде в съвсем различен свят, въпреки че тя никога не е била най-добрата в разчитането на съзнанието му. Името му на устните й беше толкова силно, че тя можеше да си спомни и най-малките чувства, както го правеше. Устните й бяха напукани, устата й беше пресъхнала, а бълбукащото чувство на безпокойство в стомаха я караше да се чувства зле.<br/><br/>Тя не искаше надеждите й да се сбъднат.<br/><br/>Но тя искала той да е там, дори и да не са приятели, били са съюзници, тъй като са се били рамо до рамо и нещо било по-добро от абсолютно нищо.<br/><br/>И Кагоме имаше достатъчно разум, за да не се хвърли към него, да обвие ръцете си около него в облекчение, че знае, че не е сама. Камерата й вече нямаше значение, когато се приближи до него. Тя си спомни, че нищо друго нямаше значение в продължение на дни, тъй като тя прекарваше време с него, не говорейки за техния свят, но говорейки (или, тя говореше и той просто призна този факт).<br/><br/>Когато, точно, тя се влюби в него... Кагоме не можеше да си спомни. Беше фино нещо, точно като него. Но тя знаеше, че чувството е там. И той й каза, че не е сама във факта, че тя е паднала, че чувствата някак са разцъфнали.<br/><br/>- Да.<br/><br/>Усещането за безтегловност я обзе и изведнъж очите й се отвориха, докато умът й отчаяно се вкопчи в последното нещо, което правеше. Тя не си спомняше кога е заспала на дивана си, но знаеше, че последното място, където е била, е на прекалено удобните възглавници. Тя обаче не се бореше или се бореше с безтегловността, тъй като беше в познати ръце. Главата й се наклони към гърдите на Сешоумару, утешавайки се от факта, че той беше тук и тя не беше сама.<br/><br/>"Добре дошъл отново." Отговорът му беше меко бръмчене в знак на признание. Той не трябваше да говори много, за да разбере намерението си, или останалата част от това, което имаше да каже.<br/><br/>Той я занесе обратно в леглото й, настани я в него с лекота. Очите й срещнаха неговите и тя се усмихна лесно, защото повече никакви спомени не се връщаха назад, никакви спомени не я дразнеха. Не, когато той беше наблизо, тя никога не се връщаше в тези мисли. Той беше помогнал и годините бяха помогнали. Днес беше просто... един от онези дни.<br/><br/>"Сън." Той заповяда с лекота, очите й се завъртяха към него, но тя не се бори, защото тя беше уморена. Ръката й се притисна здраво към него, докато тя усети противоположната му ръка да притиска към челото си в оценка на нейното благополучие.<br/><br/>"Добре съм", каза тя, думите й са твърди с обещанието си.<br/><br/>Тя беше добре, жива и щастлива.<br/><br/>- Да.<br/><br/>спедитор<br/><br/>Обобщение<br/><br/>Кагоме, в един момент от живота си, е била доста обикновена тийнейджърка, докато не е била нападната от демон в къщата на кладенеца на семейството си. Демонът я е завлякъл в кладенеца, който магически я е транспортирал около 500 години в миналото. Там тя научила, че в тялото й е запечатано свещено бижу, тъй като тя е превъплъщение на жрица, починала 50 години преди времето, в което е била въвлечена. Бижуто било изтръгнато от тялото й и демонът, който я влачил през времето, бил победен от полу-демонът, който тя освободила, който бил прикован към дървото. Кагоме се сприятелила с полу-демон, Инуяша, във времето и пътувала с него, за да възстанови бижуто, което тя самата разбила. Въпреки че не било толкова просто и лесно да се направи, колкото много демони и хора търсели бижуто за собствените си цели. Тя се сприятелила с млад китсуне демон, монах и убиец на демони, които всички пътували с нея, за да възстановят бижуто.<br/><br/>Нейната група обаче не е тази, която завършва бижуто, а вместо това зъл полу-демон, който манипулира по-голямата част от големите събития в живота на спътника си. Когато най-накрая събира всички парчета от бижуто и прави желанието си върху опетнения предмет, Кагоме е привлечен в самото бижу с намерението да направи егоистично желание да я държи затворена завинаги, запазвайки бижуто живо. Именно упоритостта на Инуяша успяла да я спаси от мрака. Накрая тя се върнала към естественото си време, завършила гимназия, както очаквало момиче от нейната времева линия. Въпреки че дни по-късно Кагоме се озовала в Елисион. Тя е в този свят от пет години и отдавна се е отказала от завръщането си у дома. Тя се е установила щастливо в новия си живот.<br/><br/>платоничен<br/><br/>За Кагоме е доста лесно да си намери нови приятели, тя не се е променила много от младостта си. Тя е весела млада жена, която е съпричастна и приветлива към най-вече в живота си. В младостта си тя се сприятелява с демони, когато повечето биха се страхували от тях. Дори демоните, които преди са ядяли хора, тя се е сприятелила и е променила начина им на живот (би искала да мисли). Като се има предвид това, наистина е лесно да станеш неин приятел, стига някой да може да покаже, че е готов да бъде изкупен, или да покаже, че не е напълно зъл. Тя се чувства много за всички, които среща, така че е трудно за нея да не бъде привлечена от другите в желанието да бъдат приятели.<br/><br/>антагонистичен<br/><br/>Единственият начин да спечелиш гнева на Кагоме е да бъдеш толкова жалък, толкова зъл и толкова далеч отвъд изкуплението, че тя да не може да види нищо добро в теб. И тя може да види доброто в почти всеки и всичко. Честно казано, с кого се е сблъскала? Полу-демон, който настрои двама влюбени един срещу друг, който прокле цялата мъжка линия на един от нейните приятели, и след това накара брата на най-добрата й приятелка да убие семейството им... Чувствай се свободен да пробваш.<br/><br/>романтичен<br/><br/>Когато е влюбена, Кагоме е силна подкрепа, винаги остава там, дори когато нещата може да са тежки. Въпреки това, Кагоме не търси любов, не е търсила любов, когато е пристигнала, така че никакви минали връзки не съществуват. Това не означава, че някой не се е влюбил в нея. Тя определено може да бъде обект на нечия несподелена любов, вероятно ще бъде забравила за това. Накрая, Кагоме в момента е сгодена за Сешумару, изненадващо.

Нептун определено се опитва да се обгради с хора, защото обича да има приятели, а и кагоме също е негов тип? Сякаш тя е сладка и силна жена, а той всъщност е по-добър приятел с жените, отколкото с мъжете, idk защо, той просто обича да бъде заобиколен от приятелки, които знаят. Обичам моите момчета да са супер добри приятели и да защитават приятелките си честно. но о М А Н аз обичам отношенията тип пседуо-семейство и нептунът е единствено дете, така че той не е имал подобни, семейни отношения като тези. така че тя се грижи за него всички по-голяма сестра като ще го накара да бъде като ???? защото той е объркан, но също така той всъщност наистина харесва, че LOL! и двамата са добри деца, мисля, че те ще бъдат наистина забавно ?????<br/><br/>фендом огнена емблема: съдби<br/><br/>възраст деветнайсет<br/><br/>вид Част човешки / част дракон<br/><br/>окупационен представител настойник<br/><br/>Предпочита тя/тя<br/><br/>награди<br/><br/>ето там тя/тя aest 20 posts<br/><br/>Изобщо не съм виждал Инуяша, но... от това, което прочетох, Кагоме изглежда е от онези хора, които биха могли да помогнат на Корин с емоционалното си състояние. Много неща й тежат на ума, тъй като тя трябваше да се бори с родното си семейство против волята си и последния път, когато ги видя, те всички я мразеха. Честно казано тя не е работила през всичко, тъй като тя е била по същество начело на пълномащабна война. Чувствам, че те биха могли да бъдат приятели, тъй като Корин е доста отворен в нейната личност, изключително доверчив, както добре. Тя просто... се крие и се бори през много.

Харесва ми идеята ти Кагоме да снима Елза! Знаеш ли, тя също е певица / изпълнител в местен театър, така че мога да си представя Кагоме да отиде там, за да разгледа нещата и след това да хване Елза зад кулисите или нещо такова - и тогава приятелството може да разцъфне от там! Абсолютно обожавам идеята тези двама да прекарват качествено време заедно, правейки малките, но забавни неща, които Елза никога не е преживявала като дете. Това ще бъде толкова ценно и аз се нуждая от този здрав пух! |
| Why You Should be on Twitter<br/><br/>Disclaimer: I am not, nor have I ever claimed to be, a social media guru. I'm just a person who thinks about stuff a lot, and this has come up a number of times.<br/><br/>I'm not an early adopter. Sometimes it takes me years to figure out what I want to use something for before I actually get on it, and Twitter was one of those things. I've been on Twitter seriously since about February of this year, so I'm pretty new at it. Still, I've learned a number of things, and I wanted to share them. Some people say I'm a Twitter pusher, and I am, because there's lots of good reasons to get on it, and virtually no downsides.<br/><br/>So what's Twitter? If you're on the internet, you've probably at least heard of it. It's a social media network that serves as a forum for conversations, updates, and news in a medium more public than something like Facebook or LinkedIn. Facebook is about who wants to find you, but Twitter is about who you want to find. Your favourite writers, actors, politicians, singers, and scientists are probably on Twitter. So are your favourite charities, radio stations, news sites, and stores. And they want you to find them and listen to what they have to say. Everyone on Twitter, at least initially, wants to talk with you.<br/><br/>But why join that? Why be a part of it? There's all kinds of reasons, and I'm going to give you a few.<br/><br/>People and Places Twitter is a great way to find out about events which are going on around the world, but also in your community. If you're travelling and looking for things to do, it's a great way to find out about things relevant to your interests (because the people you follow are people you're interested in). Even if you're not travelling, knowing about great places to go locally or knowing that people you're interested in are going to them creates an opportunity to meet them and create a deeper relationship with them. If you go back to my party post, all the people in it but two, I heard about on Twitter and then met in real life, and now we're pretty good friends. And the more you do this, the more things you'll find out about, and the more people you'll meet. And if you follow them on Twitter, you already know a bit about what they're like. They want you to. The reverse is also true, because tweeting invites people to see what you're like, and they can make the same choices about you.<br/><br/>Inspiration and Motivation<br/>Inspiration comes from the strangest places, and the influx of tweets means there's always fresh content for your imagination. I have a follow first policy, so I'll follow just about anybody, and then periodically go through and unfollow people. I don't know who's going to plant the seed of a new blog post or new project in me, so I like to keep my options open. Motivation also happens, because Twitter is just like life. If you surround yourself with people who are ambitious, dedicated, generous, and hard-working, it's easier to be like that, and push yourself. It's easier to think that if they can plan events, launch projects, or just get up in the morning, well, so can you.<br/><br/>Learning and Lifestyle Bloggers are on Twitter. Bloggers who aren't may actually be crazy. And people blog about just about everything. If you're looking to learn something, odds are good that somebody's tweeting about it. On top of that, news services and stores are also connected, which means that you can get your news up to the minute, and find out about sales and deals as they start.As far as lifestyle, looking for new recipe ideas? Follow some caterers and see what they come up with. Need a twist for that cocktail party? Twitter's got people for that too. Wardrobe recommendations, or just want to see what other people are doing with their lives? It's all there.<br/><br/>There are some common challenges I face when talking about this, and they're legitimate obstacles. It can seem pretty daunting, especially if you're getting on the bandwagon late, like I did. I spent months following only two people and not knowing what else to do. But there are ways to overcome them, and hear they are from least frequent to most.<br/><br/>#3: Twitter is for Narcissistic Jerks<br/>I think this comes from the idea that most people tweet for and about themselves as a way of getting attention. What I don't get is why there's anything wrong with that, or why doing that makes one a narcissist or a jerk. If someone has something to say, they want to be heard. Used to be you'd stand on the street corner and yell. Now you can yell in 140 characters or less. Twitter's just a new way to be heard. Now, there are certainly narcissistic jerks on Twitter. They're pretty much everywhere. Sometimes, people are jerks. Sometimes one of those people is me, I'm sorry to say. Don't follow those people. If you don't like what someone is saying, whether that's points that they're making or detailed accounts of their bathroom activities, you don't have to listen on Twitter.<br/><br/>#2: I Can't Keep Track of It All<br/>The second obstacle people often bring up is that they just don't have time to keep track of all the things which are going on on Twitter. And you know what? That's fine. Keep track of what you can. Maybe you only wander on every few days. If you're a private user (rather than tweeting for your company), and especially a beginner, that's okay. Part of something is better than all of nothing.<br/><br/>#1 I've Got Nothing I Want to Put Out There<br/>This is by far the most frequent challenge people raise. And it doesn't even matter. You don't have to join Twitter to talk. Join it to listen. Again, your favourite authors, singers, bloggers, and newspapers are on here. This is your chance to listen to them. It's your chance to gain a window into their lives and activities, and they're inviting you to do that. Want to find out what Felicia Day is going to be up to at the San Diego Comic Con? Done. I know people who only listen on Twitter, and that's great. That's what I did for a while. Eventually, maybe you'll find something to tweet about, or make something to tweet about. I hope you do, because I want to hear about it.<br/><br/>In short, if you're not using Twitter, I think you should be. If you're not using it to its full extent, try to. Don't be afraid to follow five hundred people, if all of those people are saying things you're interested in. Invite those people into bits of your life, and see how it's improved by the interaction. I look forward to hearing from you. | Защо трябва да сте в Twitter<br/><br/>Отказ от отговорност: Аз не съм и никога не съм твърдял, че съм гуру на социалните медии. Аз съм просто човек, който мисли много за неща и това се е случвало няколко пъти.<br/><br/>Аз не съм ранен осиновител. Понякога ми отнема години, за да разбера за какво искам да използвам нещо, преди всъщност да се кача на него, а Twitter беше едно от тези неща. Аз съм в Twitter сериозно от около февруари тази година, така че съм доста нов в това. И все пак, аз научих редица неща и исках да ги споделя. Някои хора казват, че съм Twitter тласкач, и аз съм, защото има много добри причини да се кача на него, и практически няма недостатъци.<br/><br/>И така, какво е Twitter? Ако сте в интернет, вероятно поне сте чували за него. Това е социална мрежа, която служи като форум за разговори, актуализации и новини в среда, по-публична от нещо като Facebook или LinkedIn. Facebook е за това кой иска да ви намери, но Twitter е за това кой искате да намерите. Любимите ви писатели, актьори, политици, певци и учени вероятно са в Twitter. Както и любимите ви благотворителни организации, радиостанции, новинарски сайтове и магазини. И те искат да ги намериш и да чуеш какво имат да кажат. Всички в Туитър, поне първоначално, искат да говорят с теб.<br/><br/>Но защо да се присъединявам към това? Защо да съм част от него? Има най-различни причини, и аз ще ви дам няколко.<br/><br/>People and Places Twitter е чудесен начин да разберете за събития, които се случват по целия свят, но и във вашата общност. Ако пътувате и търсите неща, които да правите, това е чудесен начин да разберете за нещата, които са от значение за вашите интереси (защото хората, които следвате, са хора, които ви интересуват). Дори и да не пътувате, знаейки за страхотни места, за да отидете на местно ниво или знаейки, че хората, от които се интересувате, отиват при тях, създава възможност да ги срещнете и да създадете по-дълбока връзка с тях. Ако се върнете на моя партиен пост, всички хора в него, освен двама, чух за Twitter и след това се срещнахме в реалния живот, и сега сме доста добри приятели. И колкото повече правите това, толкова повече неща ще разберете за, и толкова повече хора ще срещнете. И ако ги следвате в Twitter, вече знаете малко за това, което те са. Те искат да го направите. Обратното също е вярно, защото туитването приканва хората да видят какъв сте и те могат да направят същия избор за вас.<br/><br/>Вдъхновение и мотивация<br/>Вдъхновението идва от най-странните места, а притокът на туитове означава, че винаги има свежо съдържание за вашето въображение. Имам следване на първата политика, така че ще следвам почти всеки, а след това периодично преминавам и спирам да следвам хората. Не знам кой ще посее семето на нов блог пост или нов проект в мен, затова обичам да държа опциите си отворени. Мотивацията също се случва, защото Twitter е точно като живота. Ако се обградите с хора, които са амбициозни, отдадени, щедри и трудолюбиви, е по-лесно да бъдете такива и да се насилвате. По-лесно е да се мисли, че ако те могат да планират събития, да стартират проекти, или просто да станат сутринта, добре, така че можете.<br/><br/>Блогърите за учене и начин на живот са в Twitter. Блогърите, които всъщност не са, може да са луди. А хората блогват за почти всичко. Ако искате да научите нещо, шансовете са добри, че някой туитва за това. На всичко отгоре, новинарски услуги и магазини също са свързани, което означава, че можете да получите вашите новини до минута, и да разберете за продажби и сделки, тъй като те започват. Що се отнася до начина на живот, търси нови идеи рецепта? Следвайте някои доставчици и да видим какво те идват с. Нуждаете се от обрат за това коктейл парти? Twitter има хора за това също. Wardrobe препоръки, или просто искате да видите какво правят другите хора с живота си? Всичко е там.<br/><br/>Има някои общи предизвикателства, с които се сблъсквам, когато говоря за това, и те са основателни пречки. Може да изглежда доста обезсърчително, особено ако се качваш на банда късно, както направих аз. Прекарах месеци, следвайки само двама души, без да знам какво друго да направя, но има начини да ги преодолея и да чуя, че са от най-рядко срещаните до най-често срещаните.<br/><br/>#3: Twitter е за нарцистични кретени<br/>Мисля, че това идва от идеята, че повечето хора туитват за и за себе си като начин за привличане на внимание. Това, което не разбирам, е защо има нещо нередно в това, или защо това прави човек нарцисист или идиот. Ако някой има какво да каже, иска да бъде чут. Преди стоеше на ъгъла на улицата и крещеше. Сега можеш да крещиш в 140 знака или по-малко. Twitter е просто нов начин да бъдеш чут. Сега със сигурност има нарцистични идиоти в Twitter. Те са почти навсякъде, понякога хората са идиоти, понякога един от тези хора съм аз, съжалявам да го кажа, но не следвай тези хора. Ако не ви харесва това, което някой казва, независимо дали това са точки, които те правят или подробни сметки за техните дейности в банята, не е нужно да слушате в Twitter.<br/><br/>#2: Не мога да следя всичко<br/>Втората пречка, която хората често изтъкват, е, че просто нямат време да следят всички неща, които се случват в Twitter. И знаете ли какво? Това е добре. Следете това, което можете. Може би се скитате само на всеки няколко дни. Ако сте частен потребител (вместо да туитвате за вашата компания), и особено начинаещ, това е добре. Част от нещо е по-добре от всичко от нищо.<br/><br/>#1 Нямам нищо, което искам да изложа там<br/>Това е най-честото предизвикателство, което хората издигат. И дори няма значение. Не е нужно да се присъединявате към Twitter, за да говорите. Присъединете се към него, за да слушате. Отново любимите ви автори, певци, блогъри и вестници са тук. Това е вашият шанс да ги слушате. Това е вашият шанс да спечелите прозорец към живота и дейностите им и те ви канят да направите това. Искате ли да разберете какво ще прави Фелиша Дей на Комикс Кон в Сан Диего? Готово. Познавам хора, които слушат само в Twitter, и това е страхотно. Това направих за известно време. В крайна сметка, може би ще намерите нещо, за което да туитнете, или да направите нещо, за което да туитнете. Надявам се да го направите, защото искам да чуя за това.<br/><br/>Накратко, ако не използвате Twitter, мисля, че трябва да бъдете. Ако не го използвате в пълна степен, опитайте се. Не се страхувайте да следвате петстотин души, ако всички тези хора казват неща, които ви интересуват. Поканете тези хора в части от живота си и вижте как се подобрява от взаимодействието. Очаквам с нетърпение да чуя от вас. |
| Root Canals<br/><br/>The very thought of getting a root canal puts most people on edge. SCM Dental utilizes the latest technology and technique to make a root canal a virtually pain free and low stress procedure.<br/><br/>Rotary endodontics is an advanced technology and technique to perform endodontic treatment, the clinical term for a root canalThe term "root canal" refers to the natural cavity at the center of the tooth. The tooth's nerve is located in soft tissue (pulp) inside the root canal. If the tooth is damaged either by trauma or decay, debris can enter the sensitive root canal area and cause an infection, or in extreme circumstances, and abscess. An abscessed tooth is very serious and should be treated as an emergency, as it can create an infection that may spread to other parts of the body. If you believe you have an abscessed tooth, contact our office immediately to schedule emergency care.<br/><br/>Depending on the case, root canal therapy may require more than one visit. An initial x-ray will be taken to evaluate the tooth and root canal and determine the extent of the damage and infection if present. You will be given a form of anesthesia to make you relaxed.<br/><br/>When the area is numb, our dentist will create an access chamber to the root canal using an electric handpiece. Next, the root canal will be scraped of the infected or damaged tissue and nerve. Once the entire area has been throughly cleaned and polished, the tooth will be filled with a biocompatible rubber compound called gutta percha. The tooth is then covered with a dental filling or dental crown to restore strength and function.<br/><br/>Endodontic therapy has a bad reputation as being a painful procedure. With rotary endodontics, a root canal procedure is no more painful than having a dental filling placed. The infection and damage to the nerve is what creates the extreme pain and discomfort and patients you will experience significant relief after undergoing root canal therapy. Root canals have a success rate of 95% and allow people to preserve their natural teeth. | Коренови канали<br/><br/>Самата мисъл за получаване на коренов канал поставя повечето хора на ръба. SCM Dental използва най-новите технологии и техники, за да направи кореновия канал практически безболезнена и ниско стресова процедура.<br/><br/>Ротационната ендодонтия е напреднала технология и техника за извършване на ендодонтско лечение, клиничният термин за коренов каналТерминът "коренов канал" се отнася до естествената кухина в центъра на зъба. Нервът на зъба се намира в меките тъкани (пулп) вътре в кореновия канал. Ако зъбът е повреден или от травма или гниене, отломките могат да навлязат в чувствителната област на кореновия канал и да причинят инфекция или при екстремни обстоятелства и абсцес. Абсцесният зъб е много сериозен и трябва да се третира като спешен случай, тъй като може да създаде инфекция, която може да се разпространи в други части на тялото. Ако смятате, че имате абсцес, незабавно се свържете с нашия офис, за да насрочите спешна помощ.<br/><br/>В зависимост от случая, кореновата терапия може да изисква повече от едно посещение. Ще бъде направена първоначална рентгенова снимка, за да се оцени зъба и кореновия канал и да се определи степента на увреждането и инфекцията, ако има такава. Ще ви бъде дадена форма на анестезия, за да се отпуснете.<br/><br/>Когато зоната е вцепенена, нашият зъболекар ще създаде камера за достъп до кореновия канал с помощта на електрически наконечник. След това кореновият канал ще бъде остърган от заразената или повредена тъкан и нерв. След като цялата област бъде почистена и полирана, зъбът ще бъде запълнен с биосъвместимо гумено съединение, наречено гута перча. След това зъбът се покрива със зъбен пълнеж или зъбна корона, за да се възстанови здравината и функцията.<br/><br/>Ендодонтската терапия има лоша репутация като болезнена процедура. При ротационната ендодонтия процедурата на кореновия канал не е по-болезнена от поставянето на зъбен пълнеж. Инфекцията и увреждането на нерва е това, което създава изключителна болка и дискомфорт и пациентите ще изпитат значително облекчение след подлагане на терапия на кореновите канали. Кореновите канали имат успеваемост от 95% и позволяват на хората да запазят естествените си зъби. |
| Churchyard Bottom Wood<br/><br/>Highgate<br/><br/>Churchyard Bottom Wood, Highgate<br/><br/>Now called Queen's Wood<br/><br/>Between 1860 and 1880 the centre was torn out of the City of London to build sewers, railways and new roads. Houses were demolished without regard for the tenants who had to find whatever accommodation they could elsewhere. Managers went to livo in Kensington and St. John's Wood, while the poorest crowded into the rookeries like Seven Dials and Lisson Grove. For those between, the clerks and skilled workmen, speculative builders put up row after row of terraced villas and Mr Pooter moved into Holloway. The people of Muswell Hill watched houses creep across the fields of Finsbury Park, up Crouch Hill and down the other side, so that by 1880, Crouch End was being developed and there seemed no way to stem the flow. Ten years later the large estates of Muswell Hill were being sold. Upton Farm was sold and the Ecclesiastical Commissioners wanted to develop Churchyard Bottom Wood, now called Queen's Wood. The story would have made an Ibsen play. Two groups of honest, highly motivated people fighting for what they each thought was right. The Ecclesiastical Commissioners on the one hand and the Committee of the Hornsey Charities on the other, both believed they were doing their best for other people, and the public rose against them both in indignation<br/><br/>At that time Muswell Hill Road was a country road, with Southwood Hall at one end and Upton Farm at the other. By 1894, Onslow Gardens was built, Connaught Gardens marked out, and builders were poised to develop the Woodlands estate. Cut out of Churchyard Bottom Wood was a group of tumble-down cottages, on a triangular site. An undated map, held by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners shows six Wasteland Cottages with an opening between them - not a road, not metalled, but a way through to the strawberry beds behind. Further along was another gap which led to footpaths through the wood. These two openings were to be the basis of the plan. The same two gaps and the cleared ground, which was the strawberry field, can be seen in the 1894 map below. They are shown as 'Muswell Hill Cottages' and, quite in passing, Peter Sellers was to live on the same site much later on. To develop the wood as a housing estate, the Commissioners needed to drive two roads through from Muswell Hill Road and build houses along them. The Muswell Hill Road frontage alone would not have provided room for enough houses to make the venture worthwhile.<br/><br/>The land and cottages had been given much earlier as almshouses to house old people and were held on their behalf by the Trustees of the Hornsey Charity Commissioners. By the 1890s the cottages were tumble-down, in need of major repair. Public-spirited, wishing to do the best for their old tenants, the Trustees could not improve them since they had no money. Some years before the Ecclesiastical Commissioners had planned to develop Gravel Pit Wood (now Highgate Wood) as a housing estate, but this had met such opposition that they backed down. Instead, in 1886, they gave all 69 acres woodland to the public. At the same time they offered to sell Churchyard Bottom Wood to Hornsey Urban District Council for £25,000, but this was too much for Hornsey to raise on its own. The Council said that people living outside Hornsey also enjoyed the wood and other authorities should help, but no help was given. In the end the offer fell into abeyance.<br/><br/>Map showing the Muswell Hill Cottages which were the centre of the controversy.<br/><br/>Muswell Hill Road about 1880<br/><br/>It seems probable that these three pairs of cottages<br/>were the ones at the centre of the dispute.<br/><br/>The Ecclesiastical Commissioners wanted to raise money for its church work in Britain and abroad. They considered that they had been given the land to be used for the propogat­ion of religion and if this meant selling off land or woods, it was a lesser evil than restricting the work of the church. They had given Gravel Pit Wood to the public: in its place they would develop Churchyard Bottom Wood.<br/><br/>The Trustees of the Hornsey Charities wanted to produce an income to help their poor people, so they made an offer to the Commissioners. Their triangular piece of land was too awkwardly shaped to be developed economically, but if the Commissioners would grant them some more land to make it into a square site, they would build twenty-five neat villas. These would bring in ground rents of £225 per annum, which could be used to relieve the poverty of Hornsey people. In return they would permit the Commission­ers to cut two roads through their land so that the Commissioners could develop the woods.<br/><br/>When this offer became known people immediately reacted with alarm.<br/><br/>On the 16th December 1893 Mr Carvell Williams MP asked in the House of Commons, if the Ecclesiastical Commissioners had consented to sell a strip of land to the Hornsey Charities Trustees on condition that an existing road be widened to 40 feet, whether this was a preliminary to a building scheme and if the House of Parliament would have an opportunity to express an opinion.<br/><br/>Mr Leveson Gower, a Church Estates Commissioner replied',"Yes" to the first part.<br/><br/>Mr Carvell Williams, "Do I understand it is the intention to destroy that portion of Highgate Woods by building on it?"<br/><br/>Two days later The Star published an article worthy of any modern tabloid.<br/><br/>The Star<br/>18th December 1893<br/><br/>'Parliament must keep a keen watch on those old vandals and confederates of the jerry-builder the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. They are always alienating some piece of land or are favouring the builders as opposed to the general public. The Commissioners would not sell the Churchyard Bottom wood to the ratepayers but now propose 'to open it up' by cutting two wide roads through it in connection with one of their numerous building schemes. Will not someone ask a question in Parliament and check the brick and mortar policy of the Commissioners?'<br/><br/>By the time this was printed, the question had been asked and the answer was either untrue, or devious. Other papers took up the story. The Times, in a long report, said that the Comnussioners were not prepared to give an undertaking that Parliament, or any other public body, should have an opportunity of considering any scheme for building on the site of the wood.<br/><br/>The situation simmered for eighteen months until the Ecclesiastical Commissioners were forced to open an enquiry, which began at Highgate on 31 May 1895, chaired by an Assistant Ecclesiastical Commissioner. The Inquiry produced a flurry of newspaper letters of which this was the most important.<br/><br/>The Daily Chronicle, 5 June 1895<br/><br/>VANDALISM AT HIGHGATE<br/><br/>Sir –<br/><br/>One of the most lovely bits of woodland in suburan London is threatened. Will you help us to ward off what would be a calamity, not only to the immediate district, but to the whole of densely-populated North London? In no part of the metropolis has the builder been more active than in Crouch End and Hornsey. The beautiful meadows of a year or two ago are now houses and shops. Ballast heaps have taken the place of stately elms and chestnuts, and once pleasant villages are sharing the fate of Stroud Green, Harringay, Finsbury Park, Highbury and Islington. ---<br/><br/>---- The object is the construction of two forty-foot roads through the woods. We in this district know the meaning of forty-foot roads through woods. It means that the woods are doomed. Ten years ago agitation saved the sister-wood of sixty-five acres - The Gravel Pit Woods - and no one who saw the Bank Holiday crowds flocking up the Archway Road from the dreary streets of Holloway, Islington and Clerkenwell, and watched the keen enjoyment of the children and family parties picnicking on the grass and among the trees, could fail to realise the immense boon that the grant by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners of this wood has been to the whole of North London, but the Lower Wood of sixty acres has always been regarded as a natural complement of the other. ----<br/><br/>--- The Ecclesiastical Commissioners own nearly one-third of the large parish of Hornsey. By the liberal expenditure of the ratepayers' money in the opening up of roads and the general development of the district, the value of their property has been enormously increased, and from this unearned increment they each year draw large revenues. Surely the ratepayers whose money has thus aided in creating the immense estate may expect liberal treatment in return. ---<br/><br/>Yours obediently,<br/><br/>Signed by The Vicar of St James', Muswell Hill, the Minister of Park Chapel, Crouch End, a barrister living in Onslow Gardens and three members of the District Council.<br/><br/>It was a shot right across the bows of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. Their own religious leaders and the District Council, all up in arms saying in effect that the church was too rich and should be charitable, not greedy. The inclusion of the two clergymen was a shrewd move. Remember to that this was still in the height of the Darwin controversy. Darwin had split belief in the teachings of the Church and many people would have resented the power of the Church from that point of view alone. The Church was not so secure as it pretended to be.<br/><br/>The Evening News, 7 June 1895 said:-<br/><br/>"If the Ecclesiastical Comnussioners are not tackled at once, the building octopus will get a grip of the wood which will be very difficult to loosen later on, ---. Therefore it behoves Londoners to be up and doing if they would save one of their most delightful bits of rustic scenery. The public inquiry stands adjourned to Thursday next, and before then something must be done to convince the Commissioners that the citizens of London will not tolerate the confiscation of one of their favourite playgrounds."<br/><br/>A letter in the Daily Chronicle the next day said:-<br/><br/>.... It was with great relief that that the residents, some ten years ago, heard that the purchase of the Upper Wood had been effected; and how delightful a boon this has proved, anyone who visited them can testify, but all who exerted themselves to save these upper woods, which lie on the west side of Muswell Hill road, felt that their victory was incomplete so long as the sixty acres on the east side remained in danger. It is, as it were, an accident that the woods are divided by a broad high road. Can anyone doubt what the effect would be if the Churchyard Bottom Wood were replaced by rows of small villas, each sending out its contribution of smoke and soot? Can anyone doubt, too, the serious difference it would make to the picturesque setting of the purchased woods if a line of staring new houses were to be run up right over against their leafy frontage?'<br/><br/>This expressed the opinions of many people. In fact, the Gravel Pit Wood, which the writer calls the 'Upper Wood', had not been purchased, but given to the district by the Ecclesiastical Commission, a point they were to reiterate time and again over the years, but most people ignored it. The Commission was not going to give away a second wood whatever anyone said, and held this position to the end.<br/><br/>H.S.Chamberlain, of 5 Cranley Gardens,<br/>in a letter to the Times dated June 8, 1895, urged purchase.<br/><br/>I know that it is common to speak harshly of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, but as the trustees of a fund they are bound to administer it to the greatest advantage, and therefore, if anything is to be done to save the demolition of the wood, it appears to me that it can only be effected by the purchase of the property from the Comnussioners, who I know, are fully alive to the protection of free and open spaces for the people, and who, I feel sure, would be disposed to treat the matter of a purchase in a free and liberal spirit, as they have already done in the matter of the Shepherd's Cot-field, by granting a lease to the Crouch End Playing-fields Company - a small company in which I own a few shares, a small company which was formed exclusively for the purpose of securing the fields for cricket, tennis etc.<br/><br/>(This refers the the Crouch End Playing Fields which had been secured a few years later.)<br/><br/>As Chairman of the Muswell Hill Conservative Association, I am constantly in touch with the inhabitants, and I can safely affirm that every person resident in the neighbourhood would do anything in reason to preserve.<br/><br/>(All he wanted personally was Charity income to support his poor people. He demanded his acre of land - not a great deal surely - he believed the Commissioners' assurance that the wood was not in danger.)<br/><br/>' Muswell Hill Road was one of the best in Hornsey and would remain equally beautiful, houses or no houses',<br/><br/>(and then came the great rhetorical flourish.)<br/><br/>'Are the poor to suffer because of the sentimental objections and the hysterical cry of 'wolf just raised by your correspondents? Something must be done and that soon. An acre of back-land added to the charity-estate would make no apprec­iable difference to the land remaining, while the profit derived from it would succour many poor old and deserving persons in their declining years and enable us to hand over to our successors an estate which in the distant future would be of great value in the rendering of charitable aid to the deserving poor of the parish of Hornsey.'<br/><br/>Reading his letter one senses hysteria very near the surface. Why did he think the Commissioners wanted to build a road? Why should they spend all that money if not to build houses? He never seemed to realise that for an acre of land the the whole wood would be lost. But he had been with the problem for a long time. He was the person to whom the Commissioners had made the offer of sale for £25,000 years before and it is his name which is honoured in a plaque on Crouch End Clock Tower for saving the wood, but his trust in the Ecclesiastical Commissioners seems naive. It is sad that at the Inquiry he was to be cast as the devil.<br/><br/>The Inquiry Continued<br/><br/>The adjourned opened in Highgate on 15 June 1895. Expecting a large gather­ing, the Council Chamber had been changed completely. The usual tables had been removed and the room filled with chairs. By half past seven the room was crowded, with people jostling for seats.<br/><br/>Mr Murray, the Commissioner, said the Inquiry was really a simple one. Hornsey Parochial Charities wished to purchase a piece of land adjoining their charity property at the back. The question was whether the Charity Commission, which controlled all charities, had enough power to stop them. The Church Commissioners were prepared to sell the land at very favourable terms and the income of the Charity would be very considerable increased.<br/><br/>Against this there were three classes of objection.<br/><br/>The original Trust was for the purpose of providing cottages for the Poor, but the trustees were proposing to build villas which would be too expensive for the Poor. However, it was within the power of the Trustees to vary the terms of the Trust, so they could build villas if they thought that the Poor would benefit in the end. The poor people themselves might object, but liberal provisions had already been promised for them. The third objection related to the aesthetic and public side of the question. He took it from what he had read that the Charity Commission ought to interfere to prevent the Ecclesiastical Commissioners from exercising their own discretion in dealing with their own property.<br/><br/>The Inquiry discussed fine points, but the speakers kept coming back to the major problem of preventing any destruction of the wood. The Vestry Clerk of Islington, representing 300,000 people, made a formal protest about any part of the wood, so valuable for the people of Islington and Hornsey being used for private purposes. Mr Wilfred White said that if the Commissioners would give them time they would be able to raise the money to compensate the Trustees.<br/><br/>Mr Beaumont said they did not want villas, they wanted cottages for poor people who were being driven out of the district. Others said that there was no money to build cottages to replace the present delapidated ones but villas would be an economic proposition. Others retorted that there were score of villas to let in Highgate. The Wood was sacred. Stick to the question of the Wood.<br/><br/>Dr Fletcher said the cry among the working people was that there was nowhere to go. Working people came to him with the cry, "We are driven out of Highgate and are obliged to go to Highgate New Town." If the Muswell Hill Road frontage was sold there was no question but that roads might be cut right through the woods in the direction of Hornsey, but if the Commissioners could not get the land from the Charity Commission they could not cut the road.<br/><br/>He was very sure the cottages could be put into a fit state of repair. He was asked by the poor people, by the police and by a number of the working classes to represent these two points, that cottage accommodation was very sorely needed in Highgate and that if they once allowed the land to be sold, there was no telling where the hand of the builder would be stayed.<br/><br/>(Loud and prolonged cheers).<br/><br/>Numerous other people spoke and the Comnussioner summed up by saying that he took it that the prevailing opinion was in favour of retaining the cottages but the meeting should draw no conclusions from what he had said (Groans).<br/><br/>Others said that the Trustees of the Charity had failed in their duties by letting the the cottages fall into disrepair.<br/><br/>Mr H.R.Williams, the Trustee who had written to the paper earlier, said that he had it on the best authority that the Church Commissioners would make no roads whatever and they would not be benefitted one iota by the actions of the Charity Commissioners. Others were far less trusting and the meeting closed after nearly three hours.<br/><br/>'We are faced with the fact that in Highgate and Muswell Hill there are a number of persons who want the Churchyard Bottom Wood and will not be happy until they have got it - while nobody appears willing to spend a farthing to pay for it. Everyone says it would be a fine thing to have the wood as open space, but everybody thinks it is the duty of someone else to make it one. The Islington Vestry has 'resolved' on the subject, but the Islington Vestry does not offer a penny piece towards the purchase. --- There is no more difficult problem for the community or the individual to solve than how to gain possession of other people's property without paying for it.'<br/><br/>Paying for it was indeed the problem as Churchyard Bottom Wood became the subject of intense local and national debate. A joint committee was formed to raise money to save the wood. On 20 November 1896, C.F.Cory-Wright, Hon Treasurer, wrote to The Standard, a daily paper at that time, appealing for help. He reminded everyone of the danger of losing the wood and said it could only be saved by buying it. The Church Commissioners would sell for £25,000 and an extra (5,000 would be required for fencing and drainage, making a total of £30,000. This was too much for Hornsey Council to raise but they had already voted £10,000 towards the total. The woods were of inestimable value to all of North London so he appealed to public bodies and private people to raise the remaining £20,000. He warned that the present offer from the Church Commissioners was open only to the end of 1898. After that the builders would move in.<br/><br/>The appeal was warmly welcomed by the press. A Private Bill was rushed through Parliament and the Highgate Woods Preservation Act, 1897, became law. The Conunittee now had the right to advertise for contributions towards buying the Wood and preserving it.<br/><br/>In a fairly short time almost all the money was raised, but the last few thousand proved very difficult to raise and the Commissioners' deadline was a matter of weeks away. Mr Cory-Wright wrote pleading for more time but was granted a mere three months and then only if interest at 4 per cent was paid for the extra period on the full sum. In the end the London County Council, which had originally offered £2,500, made this up to £5,000 and the total was reached, but it was a close-run thing.<br/><br/>The Council decided to re-name the Wood as 'Queen's Woods' in honour of Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee and Hornsey put on a fine display of bunting when the Duchess of Albany formally declared the Wood open 'for the free use of the public for ever'.<br/><br/>While the campaign to save Churchyard Bottom Wood was run and directed by local people who felt passionately about this particular piece of woodland, they called on the help and experience of a vast network of people, some of whom had worked together on similar campaigns for over thirty years. The Committee issued an appeal, printed on very good quality paper and bearing some famous names.<br/><br/>The questions of open space and public health were major subjects of the Victorian vision.<br/><br/>The Open Spaces Movement<br/><br/>Octavia Hill, the great housing reformer, who had begun with three old houses in Marylebone, bought for her by Jolm Ruskin, had quickly become an expert on housing poor people in the healthiest conditions possible. Her way was to buy leases and then knock down some of the crowded houses in order to bring light and air to the rest, believing that fresh air and sunlight were the the only way poor people could be saved from 'putrid fever. She had learnt this as a child from her grandfather, Southwood Smith, who developed his theories at the Fever Hospital at King's Cross.<br/><br/>He had built the first Industrial Dwellings for poor people and had proved statistically that good air and decent drainage saved lives. Gibson Gardens, in Northwold Road, is a direct outcome of Southwood Smith's ideas. More Information on Gibson Gardens<br/><br/>The Importance of Open Air<br/><br/>Open spaces and the opportunity to breathe clean air, were essential for people living in one or two crowded rooms. Octavia Hill took her charges from the Lisson Grove slums, up Fitzjohn's Avenue to Hampstead Heath. She so loved the Fitzjohn's Avenue fields that she tried to buy them as a public park. They were to cost £10,000 and within three August weeks £8,500 had been raised. It needed only the end of the summer holidays and the return from holiday of sympathetic friends and the further £1,500 would have been raised, but the owners suddenly withdrew their offer. Despite all pleading, the fields were covered with large houses.<br/><br/>From this developed the campaign to save Parliament Hill, the next open space northwards from Lisson Grove, buying up fields in the path of the builders to make a permanent cordon sanitalre against the advancing bricks. The Parliament Hill Fields campaign was so successful that the Hampstead Heath Bill was passed and there was money over from the appeal. From this money and the impetus towards open spaces, was to develop the National Trust. Octavia Hill had been interested in protecting areas like Church Bottom Wood for years, so she was a natural ally in the fight to save the Wood.<br/><br/>The Commons Preservation Society also, was familiar with this kind of agitation and money collection. They had torn down fencing when lords of the manor had enclosed pieces of common land, leading both legal and illegal battles against the arrogant privatization of land traditionally free. Robert Hunter, their Honorary Solicitor from 1868, was always concerned with securing open spaces, large or small, for the public. He, now Sir Robert Hunter, became the Chairman of the Church Bottom Appeal. The Chairman of the Commons Preservation Society was Mr Shaw-Lefevre MP (later Lord Eversley) who played a big part in this and other campaigns in the House of Commons. Octavia Hill had been involved in their work from about 1875.<br/><br/>At the same time Octavia Hill was campaigning for a Burials Bill.<br/><br/>City churchyards had become so full and such a serious a hazard to health, by contaminating wells from which people drew their drinking water, that City burials were no longer permitted. Instead, cemetries were created on the outskirts of town. Abney Park Cemetary was one of these. There was then a movement to remove the headstones to the edges of the old town cemetries, re-inter the bodies elsewhere and turn the cemetries into gardens and open spaces, instead of building on them. This land in the centre of London was very valuable and speculators were avid to obtain it: Even the Quakers had built over one of their cemetries and threatened to do so again by building over Bunhill Fields. Octavia Hill had a network of allies in a dozen fields, so her help to save the Church Bottom Wood must have been invaluable.<br/><br/>The Metropolitan Gardens Society, set up in 1882, had laid out about two hundred small gardens in city centres by 1890. They later handed them over to the Local Authorities, so their support for the Churchyard Bottom Wood Appeal was assured from the start.<br/><br/>The Kyrle Society is forgotten now, but in its day had great influence on Town Planning and Open Space legislation. The Society had been set up about 1875 for 'the Diffusion of Beauty', to bring colour and interest into the lives of people living in dull, drab surroundings. Bright colour to walls and decoration, good singing, open spaces, Nature, Literature and Art. All these fell within the Society's remit. There was a Decorative Branch, for whom William Morris lectured; a Musical Branch to promote choirs and Happy Evenings for people in local school buildings; and a Literature Branch. The Society appealed regularly by letters in The Times, to 'the richer classes' for books and periodicals to be distributed to boys' and girls' clubs, almshouses and elsewhere. However the Open Spaces Committee was the most active. The very name 'Kyrle' came from Pope's The Man of Ross, the philanthropist who gave his birthplace to the people as a public park. | Църковен двор Bottom Wood<br/><br/>Хайгейт<br/><br/>Църковен двор Bottom Wood, Highgate<br/><br/>Сега се нарича Queen's Wood.<br/><br/>Между 1860 и 1880 г. центърът е изтръгнат от Лондонското сити, за да се построят канали, железопътни линии и нови пътища. Къщите са разрушени, без да се вземат предвид наемателите, които трябва да намерят каквото настаняване могат другаде. Мениджърите отидоха в Ливо в Кенсингтън и Сейнт Джонс Ууд, докато най-бедните се натъпкаха в рушветите като Seven Dials и Lisson Grove. За тези между тях, чиновниците и квалифицираните работници, спекулативните строители поставят ред след ред терасирани вили и г-н Путър се премества в Холоуей. Хората от Мъсуел Хил наблюдавали как къщи се промъкват през полетата на Финсбъри Парк, нагоре по Крауч Хил и надолу от другата страна, така че до 1880 г. Крауч Енд се развивал и изглеждало, че няма начин да се спре течението. Десет години по-късно големите имоти на Мъсуел Хил били продадени. Ъптън Фарм бил продаден и църковните комисари искали да развият Churchyard Bottom Wood, сега наречена Queen's Wood. Историята щяла да направи пиеса на Ибсен. Две групи от честни, силно мотивирани хора, борещи се за това, което всеки от тях смята за правилно. Църковните комисари, от една страна, и Комитетът на благотворителните организации на Хорнси, от друга, и двамата вярваха, че правят най-доброто за другите хора, а обществеността се изправи срещу тях и двамата в възмущение.<br/><br/>По това време Muswell Hill Road е селски път, с Southwood Hall в единия край и Upton Farm в другия. До 1894 г. е построена Onslow Gardens, отбелязани са Connaught Gardens и строителите са готови да развият имението Woodlands. Изрязана от Churchyard Bottom Wood е група от съборени къщи, на триъгълно място. Недатирани карта, държани от църковните комисари показва шест Wasteland Cottages с отвор между тях - не един път, не метализирани, но път през до ягодовите легла зад. По-нататък имало още една пролука, която довела до пешеходни пътеки през гората. Тези два отвора трябвало да бъдат в основата на плана. Същите две пролука и прочистеното място, което било ягодовото поле, може да се види на картата от 1894 г. по-долу. Те са показани като 'Muswell Hill Cottages' и, съвсем случайно, Питър Селърс е трябвало да живее на същото място много по-късно. За да развият дървесината като жилищен имот, комисарите трябвало да прокарат два пътя от Мусуел Хил Роуд и да построят къщи покрай тях. Фасадата на Мусуел Хил Роуд сама по себе си не би осигурила място за достатъчно къщи, за да си струва начинанието.<br/><br/>Земята и къщите са дадени много по-рано като милостиня за подслон на стари хора и са държани от тяхно име от попечителите на Hornsey Charity Commissioners. До 1890-те години къщите са съборени, нуждаещи се от основен ремонт. Подтикнати от обществото, желаейки да направят най-доброто за старите си наематели, настоятелите не могли да ги подобрят, тъй като нямали пари. Няколко години преди църковните комисари да планират да развият Gravel Pit Wood (сега Highgate Wood) като жилищен имот, но това срещнало такава опозиция, че те се отказали. Вместо това, през 1886 г., те дали всички 69 акра гори на обществеността. В същото време те предлагат да продадат Churchyard Bottom Wood на Градския съвет на Хорнси за 25 000 паунда, но това е твърде много за Хорнси, за да се повиши самостоятелно. Съветът каза, че хората, живеещи извън Хорнси, също се радват на дървесината и други власти трябва да помогнат, но не е оказана помощ. В крайна сметка предложението е отхвърлено.<br/><br/>Карта, показваща Хижите на Мусуел Хил, които са били в центъра на спора.<br/><br/>Мусуел Хил Роуд около 1880 г.<br/><br/>Изглежда вероятно тези три двойки вили да са били тези, които са били в центъра на спора.<br/><br/>Църковните комисари искали да съберат пари за църковната си дейност във Великобритания и в чужбина. Те смятали, че им е дадена земя, която да бъде използвана за пропогатен йон на религията и ако това означава продажба на земя или гори, това е по-малко зло от ограничаването на работата на църквата. Те били дали на обществеността чакълена яма: на нейно място те щели да развият Churchyard Bottom Wood.<br/><br/>Попечителите на благотворителните организации на Хорнси искали да получат доходи, за да помогнат на бедните си хора, затова направили предложение на комисарите. Триъгълното им парче земя беше твърде неловко оформено, за да бъде развито икономично, но ако комисарите им дадат още малко земя, за да го превърнат в квадратен терен, те ще построят двадесет и пет спретнати вили. Това би довело до наеми на земя от 225 евро годишно, които биха могли да се използват за облекчаване на бедността на хората от Хорнси. В замяна те биха позволили на Комисията да прокара два пътя през земята им, така че комисарите да могат да развиват горите.<br/><br/>Когато тази оферта стана известна, хората веднага реагираха с тревога.<br/><br/>На 16 декември 1893 г. г-н Карвел Уилямс пита в Камарата на общините дали църковните комисари са се съгласили да продадат ивица земя на попечителите на Хорнси при условие, че съществуващият път бъде разширен до 40 фута, дали това е предварителна схема на сграда и дали Камарата на парламента ще има възможност да изрази мнение.<br/><br/>Г-н Leveson Gower, член на Комисията за църковни имоти, отговорил: "Да" на първата част.<br/><br/>Г-н Карвел Уилямс, "Разбирам ли, че намерението е да се унищожи тази част от Хайгейт Уудс, като се гради върху нея?"<br/><br/>Два дни по-късно The Star публикува статия, достойна за всеки съвременен таблоид.<br/><br/>Звездата<br/>18 декември 1893 г.<br/><br/>"Парламентът трябва да бди над тези стари вандали и конфедерати на строителите на железария - църковните комисари. Те винаги отчуждават някое парче земя или са в полза на строителите, за разлика от широката общественост. Комисарите не биха продали дървесината на Църковния двор на данъкоплатците, но сега предлагат "да я отворят", като прокарат през нея два широки пътя във връзка с една от многобройните си схеми за строителство. Няма ли някой да зададе въпрос в Парламента и да провери политиката за тухли и хоросан на комисарите?"<br/><br/>По времето, когато това беше отпечатано, въпросът беше зададен и отговорът беше или неверен, или неверен. Други вестници се заеха с историята. В дълъг доклад The Times заявява, че Възмездителите не са готови да дадат гаранция, че парламентът, или който и да е друг публичен орган, трябва да има възможност да обмисли каквато и да е схема за изграждане на мястото на дървесината.<br/><br/>Ситуацията къкри в продължение на осемнадесет месеца, докато църковните комисари са принудени да започнат разследване, което започва в Хайгейт на 31 май 1895 г., председателствано от помощник-клирециален комисар. Разследването породило вихрушка от вестникарски писма, от които това било най-важното.<br/><br/>The Daily Chronicle, 5 юни 1895 г.<br/><br/>ВАНДАЛИЗЪМ НА ВИСШЕ<br/><br/>Сър...<br/><br/>Ще ни помогнете ли да се предпазим от това, което би било бедствие не само за непосредствения район, но и за целия гъсто населен северен Лондон? В никоя част на метрополиса строителят не е бил по-активен, отколкото в Крауч Енд и Хорнси. Красивите поляни от преди година-две сега са къщи и магазини. Баластните купчини са заели мястото на величествени брястове и кестени, а някога приятни села са споделяли съдбата на Страуд Грийн, Харингей, Финсбъри Парк, Хайбъри и Ислингтън.<br/><br/>---- Целта е изграждането на два четиридесетфутови пътя през гората. Ние в този район знаем значението на четиридесетфутови пътища през гората. Това означава, че горите са обречени. Преди десет години агитация спаси сестра-дърво на шестдесет и пет акра - на чакъл яма гори - и никой, който видя на Банк Holiday тълпи се стичат нагоре по Archway Road от мрачните улици на Холоуей, Ислингтън и Клеркенуел, и наблюдаваше запалената наслада на децата и семейните партита пикник на тревата и сред дърветата, не успя да реализира огромната благодат, че безвъзмездната от църковния комисар на цялата ---<br/><br/>Църковните комисари притежават близо една трета от голямата енория на Хорнси. С либералното изразходване на парите на данъкоплатците при отварянето на пътищата и общото развитие на областта стойността на тяхната собственост се увеличи неимоверно и от това незаслужено нарастване те всяка година извличат големи приходи. Със сигурност данъкоплатците, чиито пари са спомогнали по този начин за създаването на огромното имение, могат да очакват в замяна либерално отношение.<br/><br/>Покорно твой,<br/><br/>Подписан от викария на Сейнт Джеймс, Мъсуел Хил, министъра на Парк Чапъл, Крауч Енд, адвокат, живеещ в Онслоу Гардънс и трима членове на Областния съвет.<br/><br/>Това беше изстрел точно през лъковете на църковните комисари. Техните собствени религиозни лидери и Окръжния съвет, всички на оръжие казват на практика, че църквата е твърде богата и трябва да бъде благотворителна, а не алчна. Включването на двамата духовници беше хитър ход. Не забравяйте, че това все още беше в разгара на Дарвиновия спор. Дарвин е разцепил вярата си в ученията на Църквата и много хора биха се възмутили от силата на Църквата само от тази гледна точка. Църквата не е била толкова сигурна, колкото се е представяла.<br/><br/>Вечерните новини, 7 юни 1895 каза:<br/><br/>"Ако църковните комунизионери не бъдат нападнати наведнъж, октоподът на сградата ще се хване за дървото, което ще бъде много трудно да се разхлаби по-късно, ---. Затова е редно лондончани да са будни и да правят това, ако искат да спасят една от най-възхитителните си части от селски пейзаж. Общественото разследване се отлага за следващия четвъртък и преди това трябва да се направи нещо, за да се убедят комисарите, че гражданите на Лондон няма да толерират конфискацията на една от любимите си детски площадки."<br/><br/>Писмо в Daily Chronicle на следващия ден каза:<br/><br/>.... Беше с голямо облекчение, че жителите, преди около десет години, чуха, че покупката на Горната гора е извършена; и колко възхитително е това, всеки, който ги посети, може да свидетелства, но всички, които се стараеха да спасят тези горни гори, които лежат на западната страна на пътя Мусуел Хил, чувстваха, че победата им е непълна, докато шестдесетте акра на източната страна остават в опасност. Може ли някой да се съмнява какъв ще е ефектът, ако Църковният двор бъде заменен с редици от малки вили, всяка от които изпраща приноса си от дим и сажди? Може ли някой да се усъмни и в сериозното значение, което би имало за живописната обстановка на закупените гори, ако ред от взиращи се нови къщи се стичаше точно срещу листната им фасада?<br/><br/>Това изразява мнението на много хора. Всъщност гробната яма, която писателят нарича Горната гора, не е купена, а е дадена на окръга от Църковната комисия, точка, която те трябва да повтарят отново и отново през годините, но повечето хора я игнорират. Комисията нямаше да даде и второ дърво, каквото и да каже някой, и запази тази позиция докрай.<br/><br/>H.S.Chamberlain от 5 Cranley Gardens, в писмо до Times от 8 юни 1895 г., призовава за покупка.<br/><br/>Знам, че е обичайно да се говори грубо за църковните комисари, но като попечители на един фонд те са длъжни да го администрират в най-голяма полза, и следователно, ако трябва да се направи нещо, за да се спаси разрушаването на дървесината, ми се струва, че може да се осъществи само чрез закупуване на собствеността от Connussioners, които знам, са напълно живи за защитата на свободни и открити пространства за хората,<br/><br/>(Това се отнася за Крауч End Playing Fields, които са били обезпечени няколко години по-късно.)<br/><br/>Като председател на Консервативната асоциация на Мусуел Хил, аз поддържам постоянна връзка с жителите и спокойно мога да заявя, че всеки жител на квартала би направил всичко, за да запази.<br/><br/>(Всичко, което той искаше лично, беше Благотворителен доход, за да подкрепи бедния си народ. Той поиска своя акър земя - не много сигурно - той вярваше в уверението на комисарите, че дървесината не е в опасност.)<br/><br/>"Мъсуел Хил Роуд беше един от най-добрите в Хорнси и щеше да остане еднакво красив, къщи или без къщи",<br/><br/>(И тогава дойде големият риторичен разцвет.)<br/><br/>Бедните ли страдат заради сантименталните възражения и истеричния вик на вълчица, току-що издигнат от вашите кореспонденти? Един акър затънтена земя, прибавена към благотворителен имот, не би донесло никаква значителна разлика в оставащата земя, докато печалбата, получена от нея, би помогнала на много бедни стари и заслужили хора в намаляващите им години и би ни позволила да предадем на нашите наследници имот, който в далечното бъдеще би бил от голяма стойност при оказването на благотворителна помощ на заслужилите бедни от енорията на Хорнси.<br/><br/>Четейки писмото му, човек усеща истерия много близо до повърхността. Защо си мисли, че комисарите искат да построят път? Защо трябва да харчат всички тези пари, ако не за да строят къщи? Никога не е осъзнавал, че за един акър земя цялото дърво ще бъде загубено, но дълго време е бил с проблема. Той е човекът, на когото комисарите са направили предложението за продажба за 25 000 години преди това и това е името му, което е почетено в паметна плоча на Crouch End Clock Tower за спасяването на дървото, но доверието му в църковните комисари изглежда наивно. Тъжно е, че на анкетата той трябваше да бъде хвърлен като дявола.<br/><br/>Разследването продължава<br/><br/>Заседанието е закрито в Хайгейт на 15 юни 1895 г. Очаквайки голямо събиране, залата на Съвета е променена напълно. Обичайните маси са премахнати и стаята е пълна със столове. Към седем и половина залата беше претъпкана, а хората се бореха за места.<br/><br/>Г-н Мъри, комисарят, каза, че разследването е наистина просто, Хорнси Парохиал Чарити е искал да закупи парче земя, граничещо с благотворителната им собственост отзад. Въпросът беше дали Благотворителната комисия, която контролираше всички благотворителни организации, имаше достатъчно власт да ги спре. Църковните комисари били готови да продадат земята при много благоприятни условия и доходите на Благотворителността щели да бъдат много значително увеличени.<br/><br/>Срещу това имаше три класа възражения.<br/><br/>Първоначалният тръст е бил с цел осигуряване на вили за бедните, но настоятелите са предлагали да се построят вили, които биха били твърде скъпи за бедните. Въпреки това, било по силите на попечителите да променят условията на Тръста, така че те можели да строят вили, ако смятали, че в крайна сметка Бедните ще имат полза. Самите бедни хора биха могли да възразят, но вече им бяха обещани либерални разпоредби. Третото възражение, свързано с естетическата и обществената страна на въпроса. Той го взе от това, което беше прочел, че Благотворителната комисия трябва да се намеси, за да попречи на църковните комисари да упражняват собствената си преценка при управлението на собствената си собственост.<br/><br/>Разследването обсъждаше фини точки, но ораторите продължаваха да се връщат към основния проблем за предотвратяване на унищожаването на дървесината. Вестителят на Ислингтън, представляващ 300 000 души, направи официален протест срещу всяка част от дървото, толкова ценна за хората от Ислингтън и Хорнси, че се използва за лични цели. Г-н Уилфред Уайт каза, че ако комисарите им дадат време, те ще могат да съберат парите, за да компенсират попечителите.<br/><br/>Г-н Бомонт каза, че не искат вили, а къщи за бедни хора, които са били прогонени от района. Други казваха, че няма пари да се строят къщи, които да заменят сегашните, но вилите ще бъдат икономическо предложение. Други отвръщаха, че има много вили, които да се пускат в Хайгейт. Придържайте се към въпроса за гората.<br/><br/>Д-р Флетчър каза, че викът сред работещите е, че няма къде да отидат. Работниците дойдоха при него с вик: "Ние сме изгонени от Хайгейт и сме задължени да отидем в Хайгейт Ню Таун." Ако фасадата на Мусуел Хил Роуд беше продадена, нямаше съмнение, че пътищата могат да бъдат отрязани точно през гората в посока Хорнси, но ако комисарите не можеха да получат земята от Благотворителната комисия, те не можеха да отрежат пътя.<br/><br/>Той бил много сигурен, че къщичките могат да бъдат поставени в годно състояние на ремонт. Той беше помолен от бедните хора, от полицията и от редица работнически класи да представи тези две точки, че жилищата в Хайгейт са много крайно необходими и че ако някога позволят земята да бъде продадена, не се знае къде ще бъде отседнала ръката на строителя.<br/><br/>(Силни и продължителни наздравици).<br/><br/>Многобройни други хора говори и Comnussioner обобщи с думите, че той се приема, че преобладаващото мнение е в полза на запазване на вили, но срещата не трябва да се правят изводи от това, което той е казал (стонове).<br/><br/>Други казват, че Попечителите на Благотворителността са се провалили в задълженията си, като са оставили къщите да изпаднат в несвяст.<br/><br/>Г-н Х. Р. Уилямс, попечителят, който беше писал на вестника по-рано, каза, че има пълномощно, че църковните комисари няма да правят никакви пътища и те няма да бъдат облагодетелствани и на йота от действията на комисарите на благотворителността. Други бяха далеч по-малко доверчиви и срещата приключи след близо три часа.<br/><br/>Изправени сме пред факта, че в Хайгейт и Мъсуел Хил има много хора, които искат Църковния двор и няма да бъдат щастливи, докато не го получат - докато никой не изглежда готов да похарчи един фартинг, за да плати за него. Всеки казва, че би било хубаво да има дърво като открито пространство, но всеки мисли, че е задължение на някой друг да го направи такова. Islington Vestry е "решен" по този въпрос, но Islington Vestry не предлага и стотинка за покупката. Няма по-труден проблем за общността или индивида от това как да се сдобие с чужда собственост, без да плаща за нея.<br/><br/>Плащането за това наистина беше проблемът, тъй като Churchyard Bottom Wood стана обект на интензивен местен и национален дебат. Създадена е съвместна комисия за набиране на пари за спасяване на дървесината. На 20 ноември 1896 г., C.F. Кори-Райт, Хон ковчежник, пише на The Standard, ежедневен вестник по това време, призовавайки за помощ. Той напомни на всички за опасността от загуба на дървото и каза, че може да бъде спасена само чрез закупуването му. Църковните комисари щели да продават за 25 000 паунда и допълнително (5 000 долара ще са необходими за фехтовка и дренаж, което прави общо 30 000 паунда. Това било твърде много за Хорнси Събор, но те вече били гласували 10 000 паунда към общата сума. Горите са с неоценима стойност за цял Северен Лондон, затова той апелира към публичните органи и частни лица да вдигнат останалите 20 000 паунда. Той предупреждава, че настоящата оферта от църковните комисари е отворена едва към края на 1898 г. След това строителите се нанасяли.<br/><br/>Призивът е посрещнат радушно от пресата. Частен законопроект е прокаран в парламента и Законът за опазване на горите на Хайгейт, 1897 г., става закон. Съглашението вече има право да рекламира за вноски за закупуване на дървесината и нейното запазване.<br/><br/>За сравнително кратко време почти всички пари бяха събрани, но последните няколко хиляди се оказаха много трудни за набиране и крайният срок на комисарите беше въпрос на седмици. Г-н Кори-Райт пише, пледирайки за повече време, но получава само три месеца и след това само ако се плати лихва от 4 % за допълнителния период върху пълната сума. В крайна сметка Лондонският окръжен съвет, който първоначално е предложил 2500 паунда, прави това до 5000 паунда и общата сума е достигната, но това е нещо близко.<br/><br/>Съветът решава да преименува Гората на "Кралска гора" в чест на Диамантения юбилей на кралица Виктория, а Хорнси излага на показ изящна украса, когато херцогинята на Олбъни официално обявява Гората за отворена "за свободно ползване на обществото завинаги".<br/><br/>Докато кампанията за спасяване на Churchyard Bottom Wood се ръководи и ръководи от местни хора, които се чувстват страстно за това конкретно парче гори, те призовават помощта и опита на огромна мрежа от хора, някои от които са работили заедно по подобни кампании в продължение на повече от тридесет години. Комитетът издава апел, отпечатан на много качествена хартия и носещ някои известни имена.<br/><br/>Въпросите за откритото пространство и общественото здраве са били основни теми на викторианската визия.<br/><br/>Движението "Отворени пространства"<br/><br/>Октавия Хил, големият жилищен реформатор, който е започнал с три стари къщи в Мерилбоун, купени за нея от Джолм Ръскин, бързо се е превърнал в експерт по настаняването на бедни хора в възможно най-здравословни условия. Нейният начин беше да купи наеми и след това да събори някои от претъпканите къщи, за да донесе светлина и въздух на останалите, вярвайки, че чистият въздух и слънчевата светлина са единственият начин бедните хора да бъдат спасени от "гнойна треска. Тя е научила това като дете от дядо си, Саутууд Смит, който развива теориите си в болницата за треска в Кингс Крос.<br/><br/>Той е построил първите индустриални жилища за бедни хора и е доказал статистически, че добрият въздух и приличният дренаж спасяват живота. Гибсън Гардънс, в Нортуолд Роуд, е пряк резултат от идеите на Саутууд Смит. Повече информация за Гибсън Гардънс<br/><br/>Значението на открития въздух<br/><br/>Откритите пространства и възможността да диша чист въздух бяха от съществено значение за хората, живеещи в една или две претъпкани стаи. Октавия Хил пое своите обвинения от бедняшките квартали Лисон Гроув, нагоре по авеню Фицджон до Хампстед Хийт. Тя толкова обича полетата на Фицджон Авеню, че се опитва да ги купи като обществен парк. Те трябва да струват 10 000 паунда и в рамките на три август седмици са вдигнати 8 500 паунда. Тя се нуждаела само от края на лятната ваканция и връщането от почивка на симпатични приятели и още 1500 паунда биха били събрани, но собствениците внезапно оттеглили предложението си. Въпреки всички молби, нивите били покрити с големи къщи.<br/><br/>От това се развива кампанията за спасяване на Парламента Хил, следващото открито пространство на север от Лисон Гроув, изкупувайки ниви по пътя на строителите, за да направи постоянен кордон санаторен срещу напредващите тухли. Кампанията на Парламента Хил Фийлдс беше толкова успешна, че законопроектът за Хемпстед Хийт беше приет и имаше пари от обжалването. От тези пари и тласъка към открити пространства, беше да се развие Националният тръст. Октавия Хил се е интересувала от защитата на райони като Църковната Долна гора от години, така че тя е естествен съюзник в борбата за спасяването на гората.<br/><br/>Обществото за опазване на общините също е било запознато с този вид агитация и събиране на пари. Те бяха съборили огражденията, когато господарите на имението бяха затворили парчета обща земя, водейки както законни, така и незаконни битки срещу арогантната приватизация на земя, традиционно свободна. Робърт Хънтър, техният почетен адвокат от 1868 г., винаги се е занимавал с осигуряването на открити пространства, големи или малки, за обществеността. Той, сега сър Робърт Хънтър, става председател на църковното долно обжалване. Председател на Обществото за опазване на общините е депутатът Шоу-Лефевр (по-късно лорд Евърсли), който играе голяма роля в тази и други кампании в Камарата на общините. Октавия Хил е участвала в тяхната работа от около 1875 г.<br/><br/>По същото време Октавия Хил води кампания за законопроект за погребите.<br/><br/>Градските църковни дворове станали толкова пълни и толкова сериозна опасност за здравето, като замърсили кладенци, от които хората черпили питейната си вода, че градските погребения вече не били разрешени. Вместо това били създадени гробища в покрайнините на града. Гробището на Абни Парк беше едно от тези. Тогава имаше движение за премахване на надгробните плочи до краищата на старите градски гробища, повторно преплитане на телата другаде и превръщане на гробищата в градини и открити пространства, вместо да се строи върху тях. Тази земя в центъра на Лондон е много ценна и спекулантите са нетърпеливи да я получат: Дори квакерите са построили над едно от своите гробища и заплашват да го направят отново, като построят над Бунхил Фийлдс. Октавия Хил е имала мрежа от съюзници в дузина полета, така че помощта й за спасяването на Църковното дъно трябва да е била безценна.<br/><br/>Metropolitan Gardens Society, създадено през 1882 г., е изложило около двеста малки градини в градските центрове до 1890 г. Те по-късно ги предават на местните власти, така че тяхната подкрепа за Churchyard Bottom Wood Appeal е осигурена от самото начало.<br/><br/>Кирлското общество е забравено сега, но по негово време е имало голямо влияние върху законодателството за градоустройството и откритото пространство. Обществото е създадено около 1875 г. за "Разликата на красотата", за да внесе цвят и интерес в живота на хората, живеещи в скучна, мрачна обстановка. Ярки цветове на стените и декорацията, добро пеене, открити пространства, Природа, литература и изкуство. Всичко това попада в компетенцията на Обществото. Имало е Декоративен клон, за който е изнасял лекции Уилям Морис; Музикален клон за популяризиране на хорове и Щастливи вечери за хората в местните училищни сгради; и Литературен клон. Обществото апелира редовно с писма в The Times, към "по-богатите класове" за книги и периодични издания, които да бъдат разпространявани в клубове за момчета и момичета, благотворителни домове и другаде. Самото име "Кирле" идва от "Човекът на Рос" на Поуп, филантропът, който е дал родното си място на хората като обществен парк. |
| With Thanksgiving around the corner, here are some festive file folder games we made for the girls. Both Thanksgiving games focus on math skills. And I'm grateful once again to my husband, Ed, for making all the clipart for me.<br/><br/>Thanksgiving Pattern Making<br/><br/>Like the name says, this game is about making patterns. Little ones just learning about patterns, can simply match the pictures onto the pattern strips, while others can continue the pattern with the picture cards on the blank strips.<br/><br/>To make the file folder, you want to cut out the grid of pictures to make the card pieces. I recommend laminating them to help them last longer. Then glue the pattern strips down on the file folder.<br/><br/>I wanted to have the blank pattern strips too so that the girls could see where to continue the pattern and how many to lay out. I attached them to the side of the folder using tape so that they could fold in to pack up the game and extend to layout the pattern.<br/><br/>I also added an extra blank one so that the girls could make their own pattern as well.<br/><br/>Turkey Number Game<br/><br/>In this game the girls add the feathers to the turkey body while practicing counting and number recognition. I used the colorless feathers to act as a guide for where to add the feathers and so that the girls could match the numbers. And be sure when gluing down the turkey body you only glue in the center so that the wing pieces can slide under the body.<br/><br/>Once all the feathers are laid out, we practice some simple arithmetic, such as taking away three feathers and seeing how many are left then adding two back to see what it equals.<br/><br/>In addition to black and white wings, we also included a colorless turkey in case you want to have the little ones color their own set. Instead of a file folder game you can turn this into a craft, coloring the pieces, cutting them out, and gluing them together.<br/><br/>Another option is to use the pieces to make a felt board story. We sometimes sing a turkey version of 10 Little Indians:<br/><br/>Like this:<br/><br/>Who Am I?<br/><br/>I think this is where I'm suppose to say something witty about myself. Oh well. I'm a stay-at-home mom to three awesome kids--our twin daughters who are seven now and a two-year-old son who is full of energy. In my pre-children life I was a teacher and I now homeschool our children. I'm also married to Ed, who is currently serving in the Air Force, and is the love of my life (it'd be awkward if he wasn't). Our family is big on books, crafts, and having fun together. I just thought I would share our activities in my own little corner of the internet.<br/><br/>Zoe appears to have it all--rich, handsome husband, easy New York life--but she made mistakes in her past and those mistakes are coming back up in her new life.

След това залепете шаблона ленти надолу върху папката с файлове.<br/><br/>Исках да имам и празните ленти, за да могат момичетата да видят къде да продължат модела и колко да изложат. Прикрепих ги към страничната част на папката с помощта на лента, така че те да могат да се сгъват, за да опаковат играта и да се простират до оформлението на модела.<br/><br/>Добавих и допълнителна празна, за да могат момичетата да направят и свой модел.<br/><br/>Турция номер игра<br/><br/>В тази игра момичетата добавят перата към тялото на пуйката, докато практикуват броене и разпознаване на числа. Използвах безцветните пера, за да действам като ръководство за това къде да се добавят перата и така момичетата да могат да съответстват на числата. И бъдете сигурни, когато залепвате пуешкото тяло, само залепвате в центъра, така че парчетата на крилото да могат да се плъзгат под тялото.<br/><br/>След като всички пера са изложени, ние практикуваме някаква проста аритметика, като например отнемане на три пера и да видим колко са останали след това добавяне на две назад, за да видим какво е равно.<br/><br/>В допълнение към черно-белите крила, включихме и безцветна пуйка в случай, че искате малките да оцветят свой собствен комплект. Вместо файл папка игра можете да превърнете това в занаят, оцветяване на парчета, изрязването им, и залепването им заедно.<br/><br/>Друга възможност е да се използват парчетата, за да се направи история с филцова дъска.<br/><br/>Ето така:<br/><br/>Кой съм аз?<br/><br/>Мисля, че тук трябва да кажа нещо остроумно за себе си. О, добре. Аз съм майка на три страхотни деца - нашите дъщери близначки, които са седем сега и двегодишен син, който е пълен с енергия. В предучилищния си живот бях учител и сега обучавам децата си вкъщи. Също така съм женен за Ед, който в момента служи във военновъздушните сили и е любовта на живота ми (би било неловко, ако не беше). Семейството ни е голямо по книгите, занаятите и да се забавляваме заедно. Просто си помислих, че ще споделя нашите дейности в моя малък ъгъл на интернет.<br/><br/>Зоуи изглежда има всичко - богат, красив съпруг, лесен живот в Ню Йорк - но тя направи грешки в миналото си и тези грешки се връщат в новия си живот. Озовах се на ръба на седалката си през по-голямата част от книгата и бях изненадан...<br/><br/>Обичах тази книга, обичам историята и съм благодарен, че Марго Шетърли я извади на бял свят. Единственото ми оплакване беше, че ми се иска тя да обсъди ролята на Катрин Джонсън в по-късните мисии малко повече, но предполагам, че историята трябваше да приключи сом...<br/><br/>Исках да харесам тази книга и го направих през по-голямата част от нея. Дейна разбира, че нейният отчужден съпруг и приятелката му са намерени мъртви в пустинята на Ню Мексико. Веднага бях привлечен от нейния характер и историята. Наистина ми хареса да видя... |
| Alcohol use by persons under age 21 has been identified as a major public health problem. Studies note that it increases the risks for disability, and may be detrimental to the developing brain. Minors who drink are more likely to commit suicide, break the law, or be victims of violence. Alcohol is implicated in nearly one-third of youth traffic fatalities. The total annual cost of underage drinking is estimated at $62 billion. While most laws intended to prevent underage drinking are passed at the state level, there has been legislative activity and interest at the federal level to support states' efforts to curb the problem. This report describes the extent of underage alcohol use, recent legislative activity on this issue, and various policy implications. It will be updated as new data become available. | Употребата на алкохол от лица под 21 години е идентифицирана като основен проблем за общественото здраве. Проучванията отбелязват, че тя увеличава рисковете за инвалидност и може да бъде вредна за развиващия се мозък. Непълнолетните, които пият, е по-вероятно да се самоубият, да нарушат закона или да станат жертви на насилие. Алкохолът е замесен в близо една трета от смъртните случаи при младежки трафик. Общите годишни разходи за пиене на непълнолетни се оценяват на 62 милиарда долара. Докато повечето закони, предназначени да предотвратят пиенето на непълнолетни, се приемат на щатско ниво, има законодателна дейност и интерес на федерално ниво да се подкрепят усилията на щатите за ограничаване на проблема. Този доклад описва степента на употреба на алкохол от непълнолетни, скорошната законодателна дейност по този въпрос и различните последици от политиката. Той ще бъде актуализиран, когато станат налични нови данни. |
| Tag Archives: real food<br/><br/>Last week I wrote about the Nordic Food Manifesto, and how Denmark created a strong "real food" culture largely from an intentional effort led by Claus Meyer. It wasn't political lobbying or public petitioning that resulted in food reform, but rather a grassroots effort led by citizens with the power to actually implement and follow-through with change.<br/><br/>I ended the post alluding to one question: Why is it so hard for us to do this ourselves, as individuals? If an entire country can implement and spread a common view towards food, why can't we?<br/><br/>There's nothing really stopping us from mimicking Denmark's success. The problem is, we're inundated with so many messages about what we should be eating, and how we should be living, it's hard to know where to start. So rather than following successful frameworks that have been shown to work (like the Nordic Food Manifesto), most people jump from diet craze to diet craze, trying to find the "right way to eat."<br/><br/>But how did Claus Meyer succeed? What was the secret sauce that helped the Manifesto take hold? And is it reasonable to think we can apply those lessons to our own lives?

The unique outer crispiness of the meat gave way to a perfectly juicy interior, resulting in a sound more similar to slicing into a calzone than a ground beef patty.<br/><br/>We were sitting in Copenhagen's oldest pub, which felt more like a casual bistro than a bar, and I was about to try the dish recommended by our waitress/bar tender/proprietor?<br/><br/>"The Paris Beef, it's very good," she had said. "It's not from France… it's very Danish."<br/><br/>Sign me up!<br/><br/>Paris beef with fresh veggies and raw egg yolk at Rabes Have in Copenhagen | Tag Archives: истинска храна<br/><br/>Миналата седмица писах за Нордическия хранителен манифест и как Дания създаде силна култура на "истинска храна" до голяма степен от умишлено усилие, ръководено от Клаус Майер. Не политическото лобиране или публичните петиции доведоха до реформа на храните, а по-скоро обикновените хора, ръководени от граждани, които имат властта действително да прилагат и да следват промените.<br/><br/>Сложих край на поста, намеквайки за един въпрос: Защо ни е толкова трудно да правим това сами, като индивиди? Ако цяла страна може да приложи и разпространи общ поглед към храната, защо ние не можем?<br/><br/>Проблемът е, че сме затрупани с толкова много съобщения за това какво трябва да ядем и как трябва да живеем, че е трудно да знаем откъде да започнем. Така че, вместо да следват успешни рамки, които са показали, че работят (като Nordic Food Manifesto), повечето хора прескачат от диетична мания към диетична мания, опитвайки се да намерят "правилния начин на хранене".<br/><br/>Но как е успял Клаус Майер? Какъв беше тайният сос, който помогна Манифеста да се задържи? И разумно ли е да мислим, че можем да приложим тези уроци към собствения си живот? Продължи да четеш<br/><br/>Сподели това:<br/><br/>Ножът ми се заби в говеждото със звукова хрупкавост, пукане и цвърчене.<br/><br/>"Уаааааа!"<br/><br/>Погледнах към сестра си, докато и двамата се смеехме от изненада, и продължих да се усмихвам, когато приключих с отрязването на първата си хапка. Уникалната външна хрупкавост на месото отстъпи място на перфектно сочен интериор, което доведе до звук по-сходен с нарязването в калцоне, отколкото на смляно говеждо кюфте.<br/><br/>Седяхме в най-старата кръчма в Копенхаген, която приличаше повече на непринудено бистро, отколкото на бар, и аз бях на път да опитам ястието, препоръчано от нашата сервитьорка/бар търг/собственик?<br/><br/>"Парижското говеждо месо е много добро", беше казала тя. "Не е от Франция... много е датско."<br/><br/>Запиши ме!<br/><br/>Париж говеждо месо с пресни зеленчуци и суров яйчен жълтък в Rabes Have в Копенхаген |
