| Forty-nine years ago today, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act of 1965.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Nearly a century ago, the 15th Amendment to the Constitution stated, "The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of race, color or previous condition of servitude." And nearly a century before that, our nation's founding fathers set in motion the great experiment of American democracy by declaring that "all men are created equal."<br/><br/>The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was a belated acknowledgment that even in America, our foundational ideals carry little weight if not protected by the rule of law. That's why Section 2 of the 15th Amendment granted Congress the "power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation."<br/><br/>And indeed, the codified language of the Voting Rights Act was able to achieve what the Reconstruction-era Congress and Thomas Jefferson could not. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act—and the civil rights movement from which they emerged—served as the catalyst for a dramatic increase in the opportunity for black Americans to participate in the democratic process.<br/><br/>For example, only 6.7 percent of eligible black Mississippians were registered to vote as of 1962; by 1969 that figure had reached 66.5 percent. Today, Mississippi has more black elected officials than any other state.<br/><br/>The protections put in place by the Voting Rights Act were long overdue when they were passed, representative of the arduous struggle with which they were achieved. But unthinkably, these protections are now under assault, jeopardizing the progress our nation worked so hard to achieve.<br/><br/>Last year, in the case of Shelby County v. Holder, the U.S. Supreme Court gutted a key component of the Voting Rights Act that enabled prior federal review to ensure nondiscrimination before any new voting law went into effect.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Sadly, the response of Republican leaders has been to do nothing. Sen. Ted Cruz and Gov. Rick Perry went out of their way to praise the Supreme Court's decision. Sen. Rand Paul dismissed the continued necessity of the Voting Rights Act by noting, "We have an African-American president."<br/><br/>While the election of President Barack Obama was indeed a historic milestone, it is dangerous to think that it absolves us from remaining vigilant against the lingering consequences of our nation's past. The haste with which states have moved to enact voting restrictions is confirmation that the protections put in place by Section 4 are still necessary.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Republican governors have signed strict photo-identification restrictions into law as the solution to a virtually nonexistent problem of voter impersonation, disproportionately hurting women, young people, working families and the African-American community. It's disingenuous for Republicans like Paul to seek the votes of these communities when they believe "there's nothing wrong with" putting restrictions in place that make it harder for these constituencies to vote.<br/><br/>Republicans have also sought to restrict early-voting periods, including the Sunday before Election Day, when African-American churches have had great success with Souls to the Polls programs.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>These restrictions represent a callous effort by Republicans to make voting harder, based on narrow, short-term political calculations that Republicans can win elections by shrinking the size of the electorate.<br/><br/>Democrats have a very different mission when it comes to voting: to ensure that every eligible voter can register, that every registered voter can vote and that every vote is accurately counted.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>The Democratic National Committee's Voter Expansion Project reflects our belief that greater voter participation strengthens our nation and our democracy. We'll continue to use our unmatched institutional knowledge to protect voting rights against legislation and tactics that would attempt to suppress the vote. And because the best defense is a good offense, we're also working to expand the vote by deploying our technology and data resources to register new voters.<br/><br/>On this anniversary, one of the best ways we can honor those who struggled—and in some cases gave their very lives—for the legislation's passage is for Republicans in Congress to join Democrats in passing the Voting Rights Amendment Act to restore the promise of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Democrat, represents Florida's 23rd Congressional District in the United States Congress. Since 2011, she has served as chair of the Democratic National Committee. Follow her on Twitter.<br/><br/>The Root aims to foster and advance conversations about issues relevant to the black Diaspora by presenting a variety of opinions from all perspectives, whether or not those opinions are shared by our editorial staff. | Преди 49 години днес президентът Линдън Б. Джонсън подписа Закона за избирателните права от 1965 г.<br/><br/>Реклама<br/><br/>Преди близо век 15-тата поправка на Конституцията гласи: "Правото на гражданите на Съединените щати да гласуват не се отказва или съкращава от Съединените щати или от който и да е щат поради раса, цвят на кожата или предишно състояние на робство." И почти век преди това, бащите-основатели на нашата нация поставиха началото на големия експеримент на американската демокрация, като обявиха, че "всички хора са създадени равни".<br/><br/>Законът за избирателните права от 1965 г. е закъсняло признание, че дори в Америка нашите основополагащи идеали носят малка тежест, ако не са защитени от върховенството на закона. Ето защо раздел 2 от 15-тата поправка предоставя на Конгреса "правомощие да прилага този член чрез подходящо законодателство".<br/><br/>И наистина кодифицираният език на Закона за избирателните права успя да постигне това, което Конгресът от епохата на Реконструкцията и Томас Джеферсън не успяха. Законът за гражданските права от 1964 г. и Законът за избирателните права – и движението за граждански права, от което се появяват – служат като катализатор за драматично увеличаване на възможността за чернокожите американци да участват в демократичния процес.<br/><br/>Например, само 6,7% от отговарящите на условията чернокожи жители на Мисисипи са регистрирани да гласуват към 1962 г.; към 1969 г. тази цифра е достигнала 66,5%. Днес Мисисипи има повече чернокожи изборни длъжностни лица, отколкото всеки друг щат.<br/><br/>Протекциите, въведени със Закона за избирателните права, бяха отдавна просрочени, когато бяха приети, представителни за тежката борба, с която бяха постигнати. Но немислимо, тези защити сега са под атака, застрашавайки напредъка, който нацията ни работи толкова усилено, за да постигне.<br/><br/>Миналата година, по делото Шелби Каунти срещу Холдър, Върховният съд на САЩ изкорми ключов компонент от Закона за избирателните права, който даде възможност за предварителен федерален преглед, за да се гарантира недискриминация, преди да влезе в сила нов закон за гласуване.<br/><br/>Реклама<br/><br/>За съжаление, отговорът на републиканските лидери беше да не правят нищо. Сенаторът Тед Круз и губернаторът Рик Пери направиха всичко възможно, за да похвалят решението на Върховния съд. Сенаторът Ранд Пол отхвърля продължаващата необходимост от Закона за избирателните права, като отбелязва: "Имаме афро-американски президент".<br/><br/>Докато изборът на президент Барак Обама наистина беше историческо събитие, опасно е да се мисли, че той ни освобождава от това да останем бдителни срещу продължителните последици от миналото на нашата нация. Бързането, с което щатите са се придвижили, за да въведат ограничения за гласуване, е потвърждение, че защитите, въведени от раздел 4, все още са необходими.<br/><br/>Реклама<br/><br/>Републиканските губернатори са подписали строги ограничения за фотоидентификация в закона като решение на практически несъществуващ проблем на превъплъщението на избирателите, непропорционално наранявайки жените, младите хора, работещите семейства и афро-американската общност. Неискрено е републиканци като Пол да търсят гласовете на тези общности, когато вярват, че "няма нищо лошо" в поставянето на ограничения, които правят по-трудно за тези избирателни райони да гласуват.<br/><br/>Републиканците също се стремят да ограничат периодите на ранно гласуване, включително неделята преди изборния ден, когато афро-американските църкви имат голям успех с Souls до програмите за гласуване.<br/><br/>Реклама<br/><br/>Тези ограничения представляват коравосърдечен опит на републиканците да направят гласуването по-трудно, въз основа на тесни, краткосрочни политически изчисления, че републиканците могат да спечелят избори, като намалят размера на електората.<br/><br/>Демократите имат много различна мисия, когато става въпрос за гласуване: да гарантират, че всеки имащ право на глас може да се регистрира, че всеки регистриран гласоподавател може да гласува и че всеки глас се брои точно.<br/><br/>Реклама<br/><br/>Проектът за разширяване на избирателите на Демократичния национален комитет отразява нашето убеждение, че по-голямото участие на избирателите укрепва нашата нация и нашата демокрация. Ще продължим да използваме несравнимите си институционални познания, за да защитим правото на глас срещу законодателство и тактики, които биха се опитали да потушат гласуването. И тъй като най-добрата защита е добро нападение, ние също работим за разширяване на вота, като използваме нашите технологии и ресурси от данни, за да регистрираме нови избиратели.<br/><br/>На тази годишнина един от най-добрите начини, по които можем да почетем тези, които са се борили - а в някои случаи са дали живота си - за приемането на законодателството е републиканците в Конгреса да се присъединят към демократите в приемането на Закона за изменение на избирателните права, за да се възстанови обещанието на Закона за избирателните права от 1965 г.<br/><br/>Реклама<br/><br/>Деби Васерман Шулц, демократ, представлява 23-ти конгресен окръг на Флорида в Конгреса на САЩ.

| Q&A: Vatican safeguarding expert Fr Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>13 June 2021<br/><br/>Fr Hans Zollner SJ. Image: Australian Jesuits.<br/><br/>The President of the Centre for Child Protection at the Gregorian University in Rome, and a member of the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors, Fr Hans Zollner SJ, was in Australia in 2018 to speak to Catholic ministry leaders and survivors.<br/><br/>Michael McVeigh from Jesuit Communications sat down with him during the visit to explore how the Church is responding to the abuse crisis internationally, and what can be learned from our experiences in Australia.<br/><br/>MM: This is your third trip to Australia. You've visited quite a few other countries to see how the Church is responding to abuse around the world. Can you give us some idea of what the global picture looks like?<br/><br/>Fr Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>HZ: My understanding, after having visited about 50 countries on five or six continents, is that the Church is really starting to move over the last couple of years on the issue of doing justice to victims, of listening to them, and doing whatever can be done in terms of safeguarding.<br/><br/>I was with the Jesuit Provincials from all over Africa at the end of April, and the President of the Jesuit Assistancy of Africa and Madagascar is very much committed and dedicated to this. He has put up a thorough action plan for formation and for introducing guidelines all over the place. It's a very considerate and very deliberate effort to do whatever can be done to be proactively engaged as Jesuits in Africa — in a continent where until a few years ago all of this was a foreign language.<br/><br/>One of the challenges of trying to develop this global approach is that you're dealing with so many cultures, and so many different understandings. How do you bring this together and try to provide training and support religious communities tackling these issues?<br/><br/>This is one of the major questions we have. I think what I can do is stimulate discussion, stimulate reflection, and prepare people as much as possible so that they can do the groundwork.<br/><br/>The Centre for Child Protection at the Gregorian University does not pretend to have the response to every question. Not only because we don't know the specific contexts — we might know a few of them, but we're talking about thousands of cultures, we're talking about hundreds of languages, we're talking about very diverse legal backgrounds. It varies even sometimes within one country, such as Australia where you have states within the Commonwealth of Australia that have different laws than other states.<br/><br/>I am somebody who tries to elicit and stimulate discussion and reflection. I'm also very happy to listen to people.<br/><br/>You mentioned the need to listen and support victims in being heard. We've obviously had the Royal Commission here in Australia, but what are some of the other ways that you've seen that the voices of victims are being supported around the world?<br/><br/>In France there is one diocese that has established what they call 'The Listening Space'. There, victims can come forward and they can express themselves. The bishop is present. It's an open space in which people who have been hurt tremendously are free at least to express what they want to ask from the Church leadership etc.<br/><br/>There are other places in the USA or in other countries where victims have been invited by dioceses, by Provinces, by the leadership of the Church, to come forward. I have to say that overall I think there is a good will, and there are more people like bishops and provincials who listen to victims than we know. But there is no one model of giving victims not only the space to express themselves and be listened to, but also to engage actively in Church development.<br/><br/>In terms of setting up spaces for support for victims, what are some of the things you've seen that could really help — and that we could be considering here in Australia?<br/><br/>One of the major points that many victims bring up is, 'Can't we have, within parish settings, within schools settings, a regular conversation going on that includes survivors of abuse as regular members of a committee, a commission, a sounding board, a feedback group or something like that?' So that this voice is not only brought in on a specific occasion, or where a person feels like he or she is at a point to be able to speak out about it, but [is heard] on a regular basis — build that voice into the system.<br/><br/>That will help all of us. It will help survivors and victims because they will feel welcome and appreciated in the specific experience, and in the specific life challenges, that they went through. Secondly it will help the community at large, because we can at least make ourselves more and more sensitive to what the concerns and specific needs of survivors are — that can also talk to the needs of young people.<br/><br/>M: We have strong groups of survivors here in Australia who have been able to support each other through that process. But what you're saying is that we need some way of supporting those groups, and supporting those people, through our own institutions as well?<br/><br/>And I think we need to be creative. It will work for one school and one parish and one diocese in one way, and for others in a different way. Because the survivors with whom I am in constant contact, they have quite similar requests, and similar experiences in regard to being welcomed in the Church or not — feeling thrown out or dismissed. But they have also among themselves quite different expectations. So I have learned that you have also to be very forthcoming in accepting the differences in what this specific group, or this specific survivor, wants, requests and needs.<br/><br/>M: Survivors talk about wanting to have their stories heard and acknowledged. We've had the Royal Commission here in Australia, which provided an independent process where victims could come forward. Is there a need for something like that in terms of a truth, justice and reconciliation process for the Church internationally?<br/><br/>H: Yes, I think there is a need for that internationally. But I think first every local church needs to do its own homework. I don't see it happening very soon that some such council or commission would be established to look into this area for the whole Church. The Church has a membership of 1.3 billion people, and is present in 190 countries, with all kinds of differences in expectations concerning psychological, spiritual and financial support.<br/><br/>There is one thing that I have come across consistently in communicating with, working with and listening to victims, and that is that they want to be listened to. So if there was the feeling that victims were constantly being listened to — in Rome and elsewhere — I think that would give a great relief to many victims.<br/><br/>I think [Pope Francis'] concern, especially with regard to your question, is that the local churches do whatever they can so that victims will be listened to in that particular country. I have a list of people who want to speak to the Holy Father directly, and physically it is impossible. I was there in 2014 to translate for two German survivors who were chosen with two Irish and two English survivors when he received the six of them at home. He took the whole morning listening to them one after the other. For each one, he was there for 40 to 45 minutes. Were he to do this for every survivor he couldn't sleep anymore.<br/><br/>His example is modelling for the whole Catholic Church the way victims and survivors are received, welcomed and listened to. I think if the bishops and the provincials in this world, in all countries, followed his example, many survivors would be really appreciative of that.<br/><br/>Archbishop Diarmud Martin was recently quoted just before the World Meeting of Families, about the Pontifical Commission, saying that it's too small as it's currently set up to achieve what it needs to achieve. What's your take on that? Does the Church need to be putting more resources into how it's overseeing those issues?<br/><br/>At the moment we are 16 members from basically all continents, and the major language groups. We represent a variety of disciplines and professions, and the purpose of the commission — as the statutes that have just been promulgated state — is to provide counsel to the Holy Father.<br/><br/>A common misunderstanding about the commission is first that we deal with cases of allegations. That is not the case. We have no juridical or administrative power in regards to cases, because when it comes to allegations of abuse the tribunals and procedure are set.<br/><br/>A second misunderstanding is that we promote, directly, things on the ground. Our first and foremost goal is that we advise the Holy Father on issues.<br/><br/>So from my point of view, yes, we need to invest more. But we need to invest more on the local level, and we need to make sure that the proposals from the Pontifical Commission are forwarded to the Holy Father — which normally the President does — and then there is a follow-up process that reflects what we have given as our advice.<br/><br/>In Australia, Catholic Professional Standards Limited is overseeing the Church's response and providing guidelines and support for ensuring all the institutions in the Church are child-safe institutions. Is there a need for some kind of organisational support from Rome for those bishops and dioceses that are struggling to form these institutions and provide safeguarding in those dioceses?<br/><br/>I think ultimately the commission will develop in that line. They are now in the process of hiring experts in those areas.<br/><br/>I think the Church needs to understand that the local churches can learn from each other mutually. And my understanding has always been — and I think the Holy Father has reminded us — that the Church will not function as a centralised company. It does not work like that, effectively. Every bishop, every bishops conference, has, to some extent, its life on its own. What we need to learn more is to open channels of mutual communication.<br/><br/>There are a number of things that people blame for abuse in the Church. As a priest and a psychologist, and as someone who has met and worked with survivors, what are your thoughts on that issue?<br/><br/>I think the question of where does abuse come from is the most important one, and the Pope has addressed that in his letter to the people of God published on 20 August. He says in the first paragraph, and repeats it over and over again, that the question of sexual abuse is always linked — or almost always linked — not only to the question of abuse of power, but also to the abuse of conscience.<br/><br/>So the real fundamental question of abuse is much more complex than just [the question of] sexuality — be it heterosexual or homosexual. It's a power issue, and there we have to really work on the question of how do we understand priesthood, how to we understand bishophood, how do we understand and live out our ministries? What are the boundaries?<br/><br/>That's why I'm very happy that the Jesuit Province in Australia is establishing a Code of Conduct. Because we don't talk only about sexual abuse of minors. We talk about sexual abuse of adults, and we talk about abuse in other ways — like abuse of conscience, where you dictate to someone what you think, or you pretend to know by God, and you can tell another person, 'You need to do that', against the conscience of that person.<br/><br/>Many people think celibacy produces abuse. As I always say, celibacy as such is not cause for abusing — otherwise how do we explain that 99.9 per cent of all abusers do not live a celibate life, and how do we explain that 95 or 96 per cent of all priests do not abuse minors? But, celibacy, or a vow of chastity, that is not really integrated, that is not really lived out properly — yes, that produces a problem. Sometimes people take to drinking, sometime they take to gambling, and sometimes they take to sexual misconduct, with adults and with minors.<br/><br/>The real question about this is how do we deal with the notion of religious spiritual power with which priests and bishops are invested? How can theology help us to understand, and maybe how can sociology, psychology, or business administration help us to define the limits of power, and the necessity of keeping your boundaries | Въпроси и отговори: Ватиканският експерт по опазване Fr Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>13 юни 2021 г.<br/><br/>Fr Hans Zollner SJ. Изображение: Австралийски йезуити.<br/><br/>Председателят на Центъра за закрила на детето към Григорианския университет в Рим и член на Папската комисия за защита на непълнолетните, отец Ханс Золнер SJ, беше в Австралия през 2018 г., за да говори с лидерите на католическо министерство и оцелелите.<br/><br/>Майкъл Маквей от Jesuit Communications седна с него по време на посещението, за да проучи как Църквата реагира на кризата със злоупотребите в международен план и какво може да се научи от нашия опит в Австралия.<br/><br/>ММ: Това е третото ти пътуване до Австралия. Посетил си доста други страни, за да видиш как Църквата реагира на злоупотреби по целия свят. Можеш ли да ни дадеш някаква представа как изглежда глобалната картина?<br/><br/>Фр Ханс Золнер SJ<br/><br/>ХЗ: Моето разбиране, след като посетих около 50 страни на пет или шест континента, е, че Църквата наистина започва да се движи през последните няколко години по въпроса за раздаване на справедливост на жертвите, за вслушването в тях и за правенето на всичко, което може да се направи по отношение на опазването.<br/><br/>Бях с йезуитските провинциалисти от цяла Африка в края на април и президентът на йезуитската помощ на Африка и Мадагаскар е много ангажиран и посветен на това. Той е изготвил задълбочен план за действие за формиране и за въвеждане на насоки навсякъде. Това е много внимателен и много умишлено усилие да се направи каквото може да се направи, за да бъдат активно ангажирани като йезуити в Африка - в континент, където до преди няколко години всичко това е било чужд език.<br/><br/>Едно от предизвикателствата да се опитате да развиете този глобален подход е, че се занимавате с толкова много култури и толкова много различни разбирания. Как да обедините това и да се опитате да осигурите обучение и подкрепа на религиозните общности, които се занимават с тези въпроси?<br/><br/>Мисля, че това, което мога да направя, е да стимулирам дискусията, да стимулирам размисъла и да подготвя хората колкото е възможно повече, за да могат да свършат основната работа.<br/><br/>Центърът за закрила на детето към Григорианския университет не претендира да има отговор на всеки въпрос. Не само защото не знаем конкретните контексти – може да знаем някои от тях, но говорим за хиляди култури, говорим за стотици езици, говорим за много разнообразни правни среди. Тя варира дори понякога в рамките на една страна, като например Австралия, където имате държави в рамките на Общността на Австралия, които имат различни закони от други държави.<br/><br/>Аз съм човек, който се опитва да предизвика и стимулира дискусия и размисъл. Също така съм много щастлив да слушам хората.<br/><br/>Споменахте необходимостта да се изслушват и подкрепят жертвите, очевидно е, че Кралската комисия е тук, в Австралия, но какви са някои от другите начини, по които сте видели, че гласовете на жертвите се подкрепят по целия свят?<br/><br/>Във Франция има една епархия, която е установила това, което те наричат "Слушащото пространство". Там жертвите могат да излязат напред и да изразят себе си. Епископът присъства. Това е отворено пространство, в което хората, които са били наранени изключително много, са свободни поне да изразят това, което искат от църковното ръководство и т.н.<br/><br/>Има и други места в САЩ или в други страни, където жертвите са били поканени от епархии, от провинции, от ръководството на Църквата, за да излязат напред. Трябва да кажа, че като цяло мисля, че има добра воля и има повече хора като епископи и провинциалисти, които слушат жертвите, отколкото знаем. Но няма един-единствен модел на даване на жертвите не само на пространство да изразят себе си и да бъдат изслушани, но и да се включат активно в развитието на Църквата.<br/><br/>По отношение на създаването на пространства за подкрепа на жертвите, кои са някои от нещата, които сте видели, които наистина биха могли да помогнат - и които бихме могли да разгледаме тук в Австралия?<br/><br/>Една от основните точки, които много жертви изтъкват, е: "Не можем ли да имаме, в рамките на енорийските настройки, в рамките на училищните настройки, редовен разговор, който включва оцелели от злоупотреба като редовни членове на комитет, комисия, озвучителна комисия, група за обратна връзка или нещо подобно?" Така че този глас не е само доведен в определен случай, или когато човек се чувства като той или тя е в момент, за да може да говори за това, но [се чува] редовно - изгради този глас в системата.<br/><br/>Това ще помогне на всички нас, ще помогне на оцелелите и жертвите, защото те ще се чувстват добре дошли и оценени в конкретния опит и в конкретните житейски предизвикателства, през които са преминали. Второ, това ще помогне на общността като цяло, защото можем поне да станем все по-чувствителни към това какви са притесненията и специфичните нужди на оцелелите, които също могат да говорят за нуждите на младите хора.<br/><br/>М: Имаме силни групи оцелели тук, в Австралия, които са били в състояние да се подкрепят взаимно чрез този процес. Но това, което казвате е, че се нуждаем от някакъв начин да подкрепим тези групи, и да подкрепим тези хора, също и чрез нашите собствени институции?<br/><br/>И мисля, че трябва да бъдем креативни. Тя ще работи за едно училище и една енория и една епархия по един начин, а за други по друг начин. Тъй като оцелелите, с които съм в постоянен контакт, имат доста сходни искания и подобни преживявания по отношение на това да бъдат посрещнати в Църквата или не – да се чувстват изхвърлени или отхвърлени. Но те имат и съвсем различни очаквания помежду си. Така че научих, че вие също трябва да бъдете много любезни в приемането на различията в това, което тази конкретна група, или този конкретен оцелял, иска, иска и се нуждае.<br/><br/>М: Оцелелите говорят, че искат историите им да бъдат чути и признати. Имахме Кралската комисия тук в Австралия, която осигури независим процес, при който жертвите могат да излязат наяве. Има ли нужда от нещо такова по отношение на процеса на истина, справедливост и помирение за Църквата в международен план?<br/><br/>Х: Да, мисля, че има нужда от това в международен план. Но мисля, че първо всяка местна църква трябва да си напише домашното. Не виждам да се случи много скоро, че ще бъде създаден такъв съвет или комисия, която да разгледа тази област за цялата Църква. Църквата има членство от 1,3 милиарда души и присъства в 190 страни, с всякакви различия в очакванията по отношение на психологическата, духовната и финансовата подкрепа.<br/><br/>Има едно нещо, с което съм се сблъсквал последователно в общуването, работата и слушането на жертвите, и то е, че те искат да бъдат слушани. Така че, ако имаше чувството, че жертвите постоянно се слушат - в Рим и другаде - мисля, че това би дало голямо облекчение на много жертви.<br/><br/>Мисля, че притеснението на [папа Франциск], особено по отношение на вашия въпрос, е, че местните църкви правят каквото могат, така че жертвите да бъдат изслушани в тази конкретна страна. Имам списък с хора, които искат да говорят директно със Светия Отец и физически това е невъзможно. Бях там през 2014 г., за да преведа за двама оцелели германци, които бяха избрани с двама ирландци и двама оцелели англичани, когато той получи шестте от тях у дома. Той отне цялата сутрин да ги слуша един след друг. За всеки от тях, той е бил там 40 до 45 минути, ако е правил това за всеки оцелял, не е можел да спи повече.<br/><br/>Неговият пример е моделирането за цялата католическа църква по начина, по който жертвите и оцелелите биват приемани, посрещани и изслушвани. Мисля, че ако епископите и провинциалистите в този свят, във всички страни, последват примера му, много оцелели биха били наистина признателни за това.<br/><br/>Архиепископ Диармуд Мартин наскоро беше цитиран точно преди Световната среща на семействата, за Папската комисия, казвайки, че тя е твърде малка, тъй като в момента е създадена, за да постигне това, което трябва да постигне. Нужно ли е Църквата да влага повече ресурси в това как да надзирава тези въпроси?<br/><br/>В момента сме 16 члена от всички континенти и основните езикови групи. Ние представляваме различни дисциплини и професии, а целта на комисията – като устав, който току-що бе обнародван – е да предостави съвет на Светия Отец.<br/><br/>Често срещано недоразумение за комисията е първо, че се занимаваме със случаи на твърдения. Нямаме юридическа или административна власт по отношение на случаите, защото когато става въпрос за твърдения за злоупотреби, се определят трибуналите и процедурата.<br/><br/>Второ недоразумение е, че ние насърчаваме пряко нещата на място. Нашата първа и най-важна цел е да съветваме Светия Отец по въпроси.<br/><br/>Така че от моя гледна точка, да, трябва да инвестираме повече. Но ние трябва да инвестираме повече на местно ниво и трябва да се уверим, че предложенията от Папската комисия се препращат на Светия отец – което обикновено прави президентът – и след това има последващ процес, който отразява това, което сме дали като наш съвет.<br/><br/>В Австралия, Catholic Professional Standards Limited наблюдава отговора на Църквата и предоставя насоки и подкрепа за осигуряване на всички институции в Църквата са безопасни за децата институции. Има ли нужда от някаква организационна подкрепа от Рим за онези епископи и епархии, които се борят да формират тези институции и да осигурят защита в тези епархии?<br/><br/>Мисля, че в крайна сметка комисията ще се развие в тази насока.<br/><br/>Мисля, че Църквата трябва да разбере, че местните църкви могат да се учат една от друга. И моето разбиране винаги е било – и мисля, че Светият Отец ни е напомнял – че Църквата няма да функционира като централизирана компания. Тя не работи по този начин, ефективно. Всеки епископ, всяка епископска конференция, до известна степен има свой собствен живот. Това, което трябва да научим повече, е да отворим канали за взаимно общуване.<br/><br/>Има редица неща, които хората обвиняват за злоупотреби в Църквата. Като свещеник и психолог, и като човек, който се е срещал и работил с оцелели, какво е мнението ви по този въпрос?<br/><br/>Мисля, че въпросът откъде идва злоупотребата е най-важният и папата се е обърнал към това в писмото си до Божия народ, публикувано на 20 август. Той казва в първия параграф и го повтаря отново и отново, че въпросът за сексуалното насилие винаги е свързан – или почти винаги е свързан – не само с въпроса за злоупотребата с власт, но и със злоупотребата със съвест.<br/><br/>Така че истинският фундаментален въпрос за злоупотребата е много по-сложен от просто [въпроса за] сексуалността – било то хетеросексуална или хомосексуална. Това е въпрос на власт и там наистина трябва да работим по въпроса как разбираме свещеничеството, как разбираме епископството, как разбираме и преживяваме нашите служения? Какви са границите?<br/><br/>Затова съм много щастлив, че провинция Йезуит в Австралия създава Кодекс за поведение, защото не говорим само за сексуално насилие над малолетни. Говорим за сексуално насилие над възрастни и говорим за насилие по други начини – като злоупотреба със съвестта, когато диктуваш на някого какво мислиш, или се преструваш, че знаеш от Бог, и можеш да кажеш на друг човек, "Трябва да направиш това", срещу съвестта на този човек.<br/><br/>Много хора смятат, че безбрачието поражда злоупотреба. Както винаги казвам, безбрачието като такова не е причина за злоупотреба – иначе как да обясним, че 99,9 % от всички насилници не живеят безбрачен живот, и как да обясним, че 95 или 96 % от всички свещеници не злоупотребяват с непълнолетни? Но безбрачието, или обет за целомъдрие, който не е наистина интегриран, който всъщност не е изживян правилно – да, това създава проблем. Понякога хората се захващат с пиене, понякога с хазарт, а понякога и със сексуално поведение, с възрастни и с непълнолетни.<br/><br/>Истинският въпрос за това е как да се справим с понятието за религиозна духовна власт, с която са вложени свещеници и епископи? Как може теологията да ни помогне да разберем и може би как социологията, психологията или бизнес администрацията могат да ни помогнат да определим границите на властта и необходимостта от запазване на вашите граници? |
| I'm not surprised by this mismatch. In fact, I'd even go so far as to say this isn't something that will ever change, nor should we get all steamed up about changing it. In 10 years, we'll still have bleeding edge, complex items in the biggest concerns list, and the things we're finally getting around to understanding will be the major parts of our spending.<br/><br/>Now, Gunnar and Andy both have excellent points, specifically about IT teams seeing IT problems and solving them with IT solutions; in fact, I'm positive their points hold merit.<br/><br/>But I think there are other ideas that trump those (I did comment on their blogs about it, and later decided I should just blog here). Those top 3 concerns are bleedingly new such that:<br/><br/>we fear new things because we don't understand them, or don't understand them because they're new.<br/><br/>they're too new for us to have solid approaches to handling them.<br/><br/>they're too new for us to know if we should be worried or not! we tend to default to paranoid/worried, which is good!<br/><br/>too new to have obvious budget items assigned to them. Can I buy a box or some software that provide "cloud security" or "social media security?"<br/><br/>they're so new the business doesn't even know how to use them or what they want out of them. Let alone how we can secure them while still meeting or at least not stomping all over business needs. If the business doesn't even know how to use them yet, I'm not sure security is in any position to guide that usage securely.<br/><br/>It also should be mentioned that these new things are being largely pushed via consumerland and into the business, with IT as a sort of, "Oh yeah," thought. Firewalls, AV, AM, Auth are all IT responses to typically IT issues. Of course there is a difference there. They're also very subjective issues, as opposed to very objective items like firewalls, known malicious bits, behaviors, signatures, ports. Business presents very complex issues that are often involving people (which we can't patch) and that often don't fit nicely into blanket rules. Even if we turned away from technical solutions and devoted our time into solving these problems, they are still not going to be neatly solved. Likewise, when push comes to shove, can you have and meet goals with firewalls? Can you show improvement? All of this flows from the rather subjective non-technical aspect of those issues. Sort of the difference between a child's report card and the feedback you get from a parent-teacher conference. If you have a child, which one would you be most inclined to disagree with or not necessarily believe? (The answer is the subjective one!)<br/><br/>It could be said this is the natural progression of security and technology: from shoring up the technical controls to moving up the stack towards behavior and people. Sure, these 3 top concerns can be said to punch through firewalls and network segments, but that's the nature of those things (social media "punching" through a firewall is far different than me punching through an SSH connection to bridge my home network; social media is akin to the *way* I use my SSH connection after the hold is already punched because it is needed; i.e. social media is the way port 80 is used.)<br/><br/>Basically, all indications point to not being surprised by this dichotomy. And I don't think this is some further indication that IT/security is doing it wrong, or isn't aligned properly with business, or has a technical dark-server-room background. I'm not saying we're doing things right or we're properly aligned, but the above isn't a good argument to support the theory of those deficiencies.<br/><br/>Now for a really big jump. I'd liken the current increase in mobile computing to be as big as the introduction of computers into the business and later the PC/internet into business. Now, I wasn't around when the former happened, nor was I in the industry when the personal computer revolution swept into business, but I would bet that is the closest comparison so far. I may even say the same for social media. These are damned new and they're big changes beyond just bringing in Macs or new software or some new business process. | Дори бих казал, че това не е нещо, което някога ще се промени, нито пък трябва да се впускаме да го променяме. След 10 години все още ще имаме кървящи ръбове, сложни елементи в списъка с най-големите притеснения и нещата, които най-накрая ще разберем, ще бъдат основните части от разходите ни.<br/><br/>Сега, Гунар и Анди имат отлични точки, по-специално за ИТ екипите, които виждат ИТ проблеми и ги решават с ИТ решения; всъщност съм сигурен, че техните точки притежават заслуги.<br/><br/>Но мисля, че има и други идеи, които надделяват над тези (аз коментирах блоговете им за това, а по-късно реших, че просто трябва да блогвам тук). Тези топ 3 опасения са кървящо нови, такива, че:<br/><br/>Страхуваме се от нови неща, защото не ги разбираме, или не ги разбираме, защото са нови.<br/><br/>Те са твърде нови за нас, за да имаме солидни подходи за справяне с тях.<br/><br/>Те са твърде нови, за да знаем дали трябва да се притесняваме или не! ние сме склонни към неизпълнение на параноя / притеснен, което е добре!<br/><br/>твърде нов, за да има очевидни бюджетни елементи, възложени на тях. Мога ли да си купя кутия или някакъв софтуер, който осигурява "облачна сигурност" или "социална медийна сигурност?"<br/><br/>Те са толкова нови, че бизнесът дори не знае как да ги използва или какво искат от тях. Ако бизнесът все още не знае как да ги използва, не съм сигурен, че сигурността е в състояние да ръководи тази употреба сигурно.<br/><br/>Също така трябва да се спомене, че тези нови неща до голяма степен се избутват през потребителската страна и в бизнеса, като ИТ като нещо като "О, да" мисъл. Защитни стени, AV, AM, Auth са всички ИТ отговори на типични ИТ въпроси. Разбира се, че има разлика. Те също са много субективни въпроси, за разлика от много обективни елементи като защитни стени, известни злонамерени битове, поведения, подписи, портове. Бизнесът представя много сложни въпроси, които често включват хора (които не можем да закърпим) и които често не се вписват добре в правилата на одеялото. Дори и да се отклоним от техническите решения и да посветим времето си в решаването на тези проблеми, те все още няма да бъдат спретнато решени. По същия начин, когато се стигне до бутане, можете ли да имате и да постигнете цели със защитни стени? Можете ли да покажете подобрение? Всичко това произтича от доста субективния нетехнически аспект на тези въпроси. Нещо като разликата между отчетната карта на детето и обратната връзка, която получавате от родителската среща. Ако имате дете, с кое бихте били най-склонни да не се съгласите или не непременно да вярвате? (Отговорът е субективният!)<br/><br/>Може да се каже, че това е естественото развитие на сигурността и технологиите: от засилване на техническия контрол до придвижване нагоре по стека към поведение и хора. Разбира се, тези 3 най-важни притеснения могат да се кажат, че пробиват защитни стени и мрежови сегменти, но това е естеството на тези неща (социалните медии "ударят" чрез защитна стена е много по-различно от мен, удряйки чрез SSH връзка, за да мости моята домашна мрежа; социалните медии са подобни на * път * Използвам моята SSH връзка, след като задържането вече е ударено, защото е необходимо; т.е. социалните медии са начинът, по който се използва 80 порт.<br/><br/>По принцип, всички индикации сочат, че не е изненадан от тази дихотомия. И не мисля, че това е някаква допълнителна индикация, че ИТ / сигурността го прави погрешно, или не е подравнена правилно с бизнеса, или има технически тъмно-сървър-стая фон. Не казвам, че правим нещата правилно или че сме подравнени, но горното не е добър аргумент в подкрепа на теорията за тези недостатъци.<br/><br/>Сега за наистина голям скок. Бих искал сегашното увеличение на мобилните компютри да бъде толкова голямо, колкото въвеждането на компютри в бизнеса и по-късно PC / интернет в бизнеса. Не бях наоколо, когато се случи първото, нито бях в индустрията, когато революцията на персоналните компютри навлезе в бизнеса, но бих се обзаложил, че това е най-близкото сравнение до момента. Това са проклети нови и те са големи промени отвъд просто привеждане в Macs или нов софтуер или някакъв нов бизнес процес. |
