| While acknowledging that it's impossible to argue someone into loving something they hate, and vice versa, it's still often enjoyable to attempt the argument. When we talk to people whose opinions directly contradict ours, we're forced to defend our tastes, define our opinions, and analyze why we react the way we do. Which is why we have Why Don't You Like This?, in which two of our staffers will attempt to discover whether people with opposing opinions can get beyond "No, you're wrong!" and have a civil, constructive, and possibly even convincing discussion about their points of contention. Because no matter what talk radio says, there's still a middle ground between "We agree utterly" and "I'm right, and you're stupid and evil."<br/><br/>Scott: Since discussing my Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World apostasy, we've been looking for a case where I can call you out for not liking something wonderful, and we didn't have to look for long. We were sitting right next to each other during Martin Scorsese's Hugo—me, utterly enchanted by its fantastical tribute to the wonders of early silent cinema, and you, apparently resisting it at every turn. Critical consensus has been on my side: It hit the No. 9 spot on our collective Top 15 (though you listed it as your Overrated choice), has won (or placed) in various film-critic awards, and currently enjoys an 83 score on Metacritic. That doesn't mean you're wrong, of course, but the onus is on you to explain why Hugo was, in your words, "hollow and artificial," where many of us saw it as a lovely evocation of Scorsese's childhood and the medium when it was still in its infancy. And please be gentle as you rip this butterfly apart by the wings.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Tasha: I can't be gentle, Scott. Sometimes it hurts less if you rip the Band-Aid off all at once. (And even if it doesn't, who wants to walk around wearing a half-ripped-off Band-Aid? Gross.) The fact is, I found Hugo to be a wearyingly manipulative exercise in fakery, starting from its opening glide through a Paris train station, which reminded me more than anything of Robert Zemeckis' The Polar Express. Unlike Mike D'Angelo, I'm a fan of long, unbroken takes as a way of establishing a space and encouraging viewers to unconsciously hold their breaths as a camera explores an area; but when the space being explored is a slick, shiny CGI creation, and the camera floats weightlessly through it with no physical sense that either the camera or the surroundings are really there, that exploration starts to feel like watching someone else play a videogame. And the rest of the film felt similarly poreless and unreal to me, both in terms of its setting and in terms of its highly contrived, maudlin story.<br/><br/>I don't necessarily have a problem with manufactured, stylized environments in film. I loved Baz Luhrmann's equally sprawling, utterly artificial take on Paris in Moulin Rouge, for instance, but that film has a sense of its own ridiculousness, a sense of humor about how deliberately over-the-top it is. Ditto the stylization of Jean-Pierre Jeunet, particularly in Amélie. (Both Jeunet and Luhrmann felt like strong visual influences here.) I got the sense, however, that Martin Scorsese wanted me to take Hugo entirely seriously. Even though it's yet another achingly sentimental story about a plucky orphan bringing color back into the life of a grumpy old curmudgeon. And I just couldn't.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>There is nothing I enjoy more in film than being surprised. And there's nothing I resent and resist more than being overtly manipulated, being loudly told what to feel and when to feel it. A good film does this kind of thing subtly; a bad one uses crashing music cues and sweet strings—and in this case, a grubby, huge-eyed, disheveled orphan staring woefully at the camera—to demand pathos, and to tell viewers they're horrible people if they don't serve it up on demand. That said, I can deal with sad kids and grumpy adults making life better for each other—I really dug this year's Le Havre, which was essentially the same plot without all the cutesiness—but I find the artificial environments reflect badly on the artificial emotions, and each makes the other seem more fake by turns.<br/><br/>Let's start with that. In our overlooked films video, you and Noel both took Keith to task for championing Tyrannosaur, because you felt it wasn't realistic enough—too contrived, too miserablist, too much, too far. How is it possible that you can't buy a stymied old crank who breaks things when he's angry, but you can buy an orphan living inside a giant train-station clock and embarking upon a whimsical journey to repair a mysterious automaton that he believes might bear secrets from his dead father, but which instead leads him on a quirky voyage of self-discovery, into the magical land of cinema? Did you never find Hugo's gaudy rococo design, aggressive heartstring-plucking, or wheelbarrow-loads of quirk even a little excessive or hard to swallow?<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Scott: Jeunet and Luhrmann as influences on Scorsese?! Forget being indelicate, now you're deliberately poking me with a sharp stick. If you're looking for inspirations for Hugo—indeed, if you're looking for the emotional core of Hugo—you have to go back to Scorsese's childhood on Elizabeth Street in Little Italy, where an asthmatic little boy, unable to play outside with the other kids, retreated to Alexander Korda fantasies like The Thief Of Bagdad. Or, more simply, just go straight to the source himself: George Méliès, whose A Trip To The Moon remains the Big Bang of all cinematic fantasies, that moment when the camera was not used to document the world as it is, but whatever whimsical, magical, transporting place a filmmaker wants to invent for it. And that tradition has been developed and expanded upon for decades before the likes of Jeunet and Luhrmann got their grubby little paws on it.<br/><br/>And speaking of Jeunet, nice attempt to take away my rhetorical weapon, but I'll say it anyway: How can you love Amélie, yet find Hugo synthetic and "excessive" and "wearyingly manipulative"? You say that Amélie and Moulin Rouge have redeeming "sense of [their] own ridiculousness" where Scorsese means us to take Hugo seriously, and I don't think that's the case, at least on the latter point. That Scorsese feels evident passion about the movies is, I suppose, why you'd interpret Hugo as self-serious. But to me, it's those feelings that give the film an emotional ballast that the Luhrmann and Jeunet films don't have. All three films make aggressive use of the marvels of CGI—and Scorsese adds 3D to the mix, to wonderful effect—but where you and I differ is on the issue of weightlessness. I agree that CGI has a distancing effect; worlds composed entirely of digital plasticine are flexible to the point where they sometimes have no presence. You referred to Hugo in your "Overrated" entry for our Best Of Film piece as "a CGI gimcrack"—a perfect dis… for another movie.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>It's fair to say that Scorsese has built Hugo around a standard-issue, "heartstring-plucking" children's book/movie plot: Orphan misses his daddy, creates his own little fantasy world, gloms onto a new friend, convinces a crusty old fuddy-duddy to soften up and maybe adopt him. But that's just the narrative skeleton, and Scorsese provides plenty of flesh and blood. For one, you can't watch Hugo, the lonely boy, peering out from clock towers to the hustle-and-bustle of a Paris train station without thinking of Scorsese, another lonely boy, staring out of his bedroom window on Elizabeth Street. And even if you're not a big enough film nerd to make that connection, I really feel like Hugo's journey is not in finding a new father figure, but in persisting with the mechanical magic that stands as his own father's legacy. That's what film is: The persistence of vision that allows us to accept an illusory version of the world at 24 frames per second is science and magic at once. Hugo's relationship with Méliès isn't about him cozying up to a new daddy, but sharing a common enthusiasm the old man has submerged in bitterness. To me, that's a far more unique angle on a potentially shopworn premise.<br/><br/>Did you really find none of Hugo enchanting? Even the film's few detractors seem willing to admit that the sequences evoking cinema history and Méliès' studio—with Michael Stuhlbarg as the heroic film scholar!—were terrific. It felt, in the best possible way, like a heady compression of my History Of Film 101 class in college, condensing a semester's worth of clips and context into something between a montage and an animated pop-up book. And it speaks to the ingenious design of the film, which layers fact and fantasy so beautifully that it's at once a history of Méliès and the birth of cinema, and just the sort of simple, sumptuously produced cinematic wonder that Scorsese himself would have loved as a child. Thank goodness Hugo doesn't follow the Jeunet/Luhrmann model and have "a sense of its own ridiculousness." As a fantasy connoisseur yourself, wouldn't you say there's value in playing it straight and earnest and unabashed rather than winking at the audience? You may find Hugo sickly sweet, but I don't think the authenticity of its sentiment is to be denied.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Tasha: Yes, I did in fact find parts of Hugo enchanting. (Notice how I'm answering your question up front, whereas you were too busy frothing with apoplexy to address mine, though I assume that's an answer in its own right. Okay, "influence" may be overstating the case—I just meant the visual style looked very familiar. Though as Keith pointed out when you brought this up in person, Scorsese is neither opposed to drawing inspiration from other people's visuals, nor immune to it.) Primarily, I was enchanted by the parts dealing with Georges Méliès' backstory, with his love of cinema, with the work he put into his art and the joy he got out of it. There's an awful lot of beauty and fun in the staging of the underwater-court scene from Méliès' "Fairyland," and in the sequence at the end, focusing on Méliès footage. I'll grant you that Hugo's connection with Méliès over a shared love of film is a nice touch. And I do enjoy a good film about filmmaking.<br/><br/>But Hugo isn't primarily about film, in spite of the Méliès tie-ins. In addition to the themes you cite, it's also about finding your purpose, as the characters expressly, laboriously explain to each other and to us. And it's about spectacle, and big action setpieces, and chases, and happily-ever-after endings where even the angry bully and the shy older couple and fergawdsakes even the cranky dachshund all get paired off with charming love interests by the end. It's about the super-precocious Hermione Granger-type being bossy and perky and clever and praising the magical worlds encased in books. And all of this business is mighty familiar, and mighty artificial.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Yes, Scorsese is playing with archetypes. Problem is, I never felt he imbued them with anything new, fresh, or believable, in spite of his own backstory. I would have much preferred a story about a young Scorsese growing up with asthma—something small-scale and real, without vast rooms full of CGI clockwork and golden glowing dust-motes and prophetic dreams and a raging adult tyrant-guard with a heart of gold—all of that outsized, over-the-top nonsense. You keep citing Scorsese's personal background and love of film as evidence that he's really feeling what he's putting on the screen, but I don't feel his personal touch in any of this, except the moments that are expressly about film. The core emotions may be real, but that doesn't make the execution less false.<br/><br/>You say the authenticity of the emotion isn't to be denied. I don't question whether Scorsese personally felt lonely and isolated as a child, but I don't feel loneliness and isolation on the screen—I see a bunch of exaggerated signifiers (Hugo is filthy and his clothes are worn and all the adults yell at him and he regularly gets chased by a scary dog!) and big beats, with shouting and weeping and Spielbergian wonder-emoting. For me, sincerity is more convincing and more personal when it's quiet and direct; when someone's shouting his opinions at me, I assume he's either really angry, or just trying to overwhelm my senses to keep me from expressing my own opinion. Hugo was one long shout, as far as I was concerned.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Why didn't I get that sense of fakery from Amélie, you ask? Actually, I did. I'll completely acknowledge that Amélie and Moulin Rouge are both big, manipulative, artificial constructions in the exact same vein, demanding specific emotions at specific intervals, and trying to sell those emotions with heavy emoting and aggressive soundtrack prodding. Neither of them really sold me on their emotions as authentic human feeling. What I enjoyed in those two films was the construction—particularly Amélie's heady, laughable lists of random characterizing features and experiences for its cast, and Moulin Rouge's musical-magpie mashups and recontextualizations. I'm often sold on stories that do creative or ambitious things with structure, and both of those movies qualify, where Hugo is a much more linear, standard kid-quest.<br/><br/>But in the end, for me, it really does come down to a feeling that those movies are goofs, whereas Hugo is meant to be taken seriously at every treacly moment. You don't think that's true—but you're simultaneously defending its integrity in terms of its absolutely authentic, rooted-in-Scorsese's-history emotion, and telling me I'm wrong, and he doesn't mean it to be taken seriously. How do you reconcile those two statements? What about the film suggests to you that it isn't meant to be taken at face value? And is it possible this is just another Curious Case Of Benjamin Button-like situation where I find the use of kids in big-budget films to be largely sappy and melodramatic, whereas you as a dad find it bypasses your cynicism and goes straight to your family-feeling?<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Scott: Not sure I meant that Scorsese doesn't mean to be taken seriously; it's just that he's chosen a whimsical vehicle through which to express a serious love of the movies. When you say, "But Hugo isn't primarily about film, in spite of the Méliès tie-ins," I'm mystified. I grant that you find many elements of Hugo overly familiar and laborious and full of Spielbergian wonder-emoting—there's nothing I can do to argue around that perception, which other Hugo doubters share. Sometimes a film means to charm and enchant, and it doesn't for some; you've got Hugo and I've got Amélie, though I think the latter, deliberately artificial as it is, means for us to find it romantic. (Rather than, say, some horrible mechanical contraption fit for a Saw sequel.)<br/><br/>But to say Hugo isn't primarily about film? If it's not about film, then it's the most pointlessly discursive story about [whatever you think it's about] I've ever seen. The relationship between Hugo and Méliès is the heart of the movie, and at the heart of that is not just some stock connection between Plucky Orphan and Crusty Old Guy With A Heart Of Gold, but a shared affinity for engineered magic—specifically the magic of the movies. I think Scorsese and his collaborators have found a way to express their enthusiasm over the early days of cinema through a fantasy that's accessible to all ages. The archetype-filled children's tale is the merely the crust here; cinema is the pie. (Mmmm… pie.)<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>As for The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button, I don't see much of a connection, other than trying to expose me as a Benjamin Button defender as a way of damaging my credibility. (Incidentally, how are the extras on that G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra Blu-ray?) I've said to you that the sleep-deprived new dad in me was perhaps vulnerable to Benjamin Button, but I can't imagine a time when the premise of aging in reverse wouldn't move me. (Cradling the love of your life in your arms as an infant? How can you not be affected by that?) And besides, I don't see how Benjamin Button relates much to Hugo as a film concerning kids, since that's just a small segment of a story that spans a much larger trajectory.<br/><br/>So have I convinced you? Likely not. But I'm happy to learn that Hugo wasn't entirely devoid of enchantments for you. The sequences on Méliès the filmmaker are what put Hugo over for me—and in that, at least, we can share some movie love.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Tasha: Nope, I can't say you've convinced me, any more than I've convinced you. It's impossible to argue anyone into a visceral love of anything, and it really should be equally impossible to talk someone down from visceral love. Mostly, you've let me see Hugo in Scott-O-Vision, which is an interesting experience; at least now I'm mildly convinced that we didn't somehow manage to see entirely different films which both somehow had the same name and director.<br/><br/>We certainly had different experiences, though, and to my mind, focused on different aspects of the production: I still don't see the "film is marvelous" theme as the movie's single strand, so much as one among too many. "Pointlessly discursive" almost covers it, though I'd throw in "often needlessly cutesy and precious" on top of that. While you're focused on the film's tasty pie filling, I feel like that pie was covered with a pound of crystallized sugar, and I think that does make a difference, regardless of the film's core message or handful of terrific scenes. See also Benjamin Button, which I did not bring up just to chafe you—I really do think you have more of a sentimental streak than I do regarding children in cinema, especially when they're used more as symbols of vulnerability and innocence than as human characters. Hey, you know what film totally does not have cute wide-eyed moppets bringing hope to a cynical world? G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra. Maybe I will go watch those Blu-ray extras. I could use some explosion-insulin to compensate for Hugo's sweetness. | Макар да признаваме, че е невъзможно да убедим някого да обича нещо, което мрази, и обратно, все пак често е приятно да опитаме аргумента. Когато говорим с хора, чиито мнения директно противоречат на нашите, ние сме принудени да защитаваме нашите вкусове, да определяме нашите мнения и да анализираме защо реагираме по начина, по който го правим. Ето защо имаме Why Don't You Like This?, в която двама от нашите служители ще се опитат да открият дали хората с противоположни мнения могат да стигнат отвъд "Не, грешиш!" и да имат гражданска, конструктивна и вероятно дори убедителна дискусия за техните точки на спор. Защото каквото и да говори радиото, все още има средно положение между "Съгласни сме напълно" и "Аз съм прав, а ти си глупав и зъл".<br/><br/>Скот: Откакто обсъждахме моето вероотстъпничество Скот Пилгрим срещу света, търсихме случай, в който мога да ви извикам, че не харесвате нещо прекрасно, и не трябваше да търсим дълго. Седяхме един до друг по време на "Хюгоем" на Мартин Скорсезе, напълно омагьосани от фантастичната му почит към чудесата на ранното нямо кино, а вие, очевидно, му се съпротивлявате на всяка крачка. Критическият консенсус беше на моя страна: той достигна до 9-то място в нашия колективен Топ 15 (макар че го изброихте като вашия надценен избор), спечели (или постави) в различни филмови-критически награди и в момента се радва на 83 точки на Metacritic. Това не означава, че грешите, разбира се, но тежестта е върху вас, за да обясните защо Хюго е бил, по вашите думи, "кух и изкуствен", където много от нас го виждаха като прекрасно пресъздаване на детството на Скорсезе и средата, когато все още е бил в ранна детска възраст. И моля ви, бъдете нежни, докато разкъсвате тази пеперуда за крилата.<br/><br/>Реклама<br/><br/>Таша: Не мога да бъда нежен, Скот. Понякога боли по-малко, ако откъснеш лепенката наведнъж. (И дори да не го направи, кой иска да се разхожда наоколо облечен с полуразкъсана лепенка? Грос.) Факт е, че намирам Хюго за изморително манипулативно упражнение по фалшификация, започвайки от отварянето му през гарата в Париж, което ми напомня повече от всичко на "Полярен експрес" на Робърт Земекис. За разлика от Майк Д'Анджело, аз съм фен на дългите, непрекъсващи се стъпки като начин за създаване на пространство и насърчаване на зрителите несъзнателно да задържат дъха си, докато камерата изследва дадена област; но когато пространството, което се изследва, е хлъзгаво, лъскаво CGI творение, а камерата плава безтегловно през него без физическо чувство, че или камерата, или околностите наистина са там, това изследване започва да се чувства като да гледа някой друг да играе видеоигра. А останалата част от филма ми се струваше също толкова пореста и нереална, както по отношение на обстановката, така и по отношение на нейната силно скалъпена, сладникава история.<br/><br/>Не е задължително да имам проблем с произведените, стилизирани среди във филма. Обичах еднакво разтегнатия, напълно изкуствен поглед на Баз Лурман върху Париж в Мулен Руж, например, но този филм има чувство за собствената си нелепост, чувство за хумор за това колко умишлено е над най-горното. Дито стилизирането на Жан-Пиер Жоне, особено в Амели. (И Жоне, и Лурман се чувстваха като силни визуални влияния тук.) Имах чувството обаче, че Мартин Скорсезе иска да взема Хюго изцяло на сериозно. Въпреки че това е още една болезнена сантиментална история за едно смело сираче, което връща цвета в живота на един сърдит стар калпазанин.<br/><br/>Реклама<br/><br/>Няма нищо, на което да се наслаждавам повече от това да съм изненадан, и няма нищо, на което да се възмущавам и да се противопоставям повече от това да бъда открито манипулиран, да ми се казва шумно какво да чувствам и кога да го чувствам. Добрият филм прави такива неща едва доловимо; лошият използва разбиващи музикални сигнали и сладки струни – а в този случай мърляв, с огромни очи, разрошен сирак, взиращ се печално в камерата – за да изисква патос и да казва на зрителите, че са ужасни хора, ако не го сервират по поръчка. Това каза, че мога да се справя с тъжни деца и сърдити възрастни, които правят живота по-добър един за друг - наистина изкопах тазгодишния Le Havre, който по същество беше един и същ парцел без цялата сладкота - но намирам, че изкуствената среда се отразява зле на изкуствените емоции и всеки прави другия да изглежда по-фалшив на завои.<br/><br/>Да започнем с това. В нашето пропуснато видео, ти и Ноел и двамата сте взели Кийт за защитник на Тиранозавъра, защото сте смятали, че не е достатъчно реалистично - твърде скалъпено, твърде скъперниче, твърде много, твърде далеч. Как е възможно да не можеш да си купиш старомоден манияк, който чупи неща, когато е ядосан, но можеш да си купиш сирак, живеещ в гигантски часовник на гарата и предприемащ причудливо пътуване, за да поправи мистериозен автомат, за който вярва, че може да носи тайни от мъртвия му баща, но който вместо това го води на странно пътешествие на самооткриване, в магическата земя на киното? Никога ли не сте намирали крещящия рококо дизайн на Хюго, агресивното скубане на сърца или количките, пълни с приумици, дори малко прекалено или трудно за преглъщане?<br/><br/>Реклама<br/><br/>Скот: Жанет и Лурман като влияния върху Скорсезе?! Забравете да бъдете неделикатни, сега умишлено ме ръчкате с остра пръчка. Ако търсите вдъхновение за Хюго – всъщност, ако търсите емоционалното ядро на Хюго – трябва да се върнете в детството на Скорсезе на Елизабет Стрийт в Малка Италия, където астматично малко момче, неспособно да играе навън с другите деца, се оттегля към фантазиите на Александър Корда като Крадецът на Багдад. Или, по-просто, просто отидете направо към самия източник: Джордж Мелиес, чието пътуване до Луната остава Големият взрив на всички кинематографични фантазии, този момент, когато камерата не е била използвана за документиране на света такъв, какъвто е, но каквото и причудливо, магическо, транспортиращо място, което режисьорът иска да измисли за него. И тази традиция се развива и разширява в продължение на десетилетия, преди хора като Жьоне и Лурман да се сдобият с мръсните си малки лапи.<br/><br/>И говорейки за Жуне, хубав опит да ми отнеме реторичното оръжие, но ще го кажа така или иначе: Как може да обичаш Амели, но да намираш Хюго за синтетичен и "прекомерно манипулативен" и "изтощително манипулативен"? Казвате, че Амели и Мулен Руж са изкупили "чувството за собствената си нелепост", където Скорсезе означава да вземем Хюго на сериозно, и не мисля, че това е така, поне по последната точка. Това, че Скорсезе изпитва очевидна страст към филмите, е, предполагам, причината да тълкувате Хюго като самонадеян, но за мен именно тези чувства придават на филма емоционален баласт, какъвто филмите Лурман и Жуне нямат. И трите филма използват агресивно чудесата на CGI – а Скорсезе добавя 3D към микса, за прекрасен ефект – но там, където ние с вас се различаваме, е по въпроса за безтегловността. Съгласен съм, че CGI има дистанциращ ефект; светове, съставени изцяло от дигитален пластилин, са гъвкави до степен, в която понякога нямат присъствие. Вие споменахте Хюго във вашето "Преувеличено" вписване за най-доброто ни филмово произведение като "CGI gimcrack" - перфектното dis... за друг филм.<br/><br/>Реклама<br/><br/>Справедливо е да се каже, че Скорсезе е изградил Хюго около стандартен-издател, "сърцераздирателен" детска книга / филм сюжет: Orphan липсва на баща си, създава свой собствен малък фантастичен свят, gloms върху нов приятел, убеждава корав стар fuddy-duddy да омекне и може би да го осинови. Но това е само повествователният скелет, а Скорсезе осигурява изобилие от плът и кръв. Първо, не можеш да гледаш Хюго, самотното момче, надничащо от часовниковите кули до блъсканицата на парижка гара, без да мислиш за Скорсезе, друго самотно момче, взиращо се през прозореца на спалнята си на улица Елизабет. И дори и да не сте достатъчно голям филмов маниак, за да направите тази връзка, наистина чувствам, че пътуването на Хюго не е в намирането на нова бащина фигура, а в постоянството с механичната магия, която стои като наследство на собствения му баща. Това е филмът: Упорството на зрението, което ни позволява да приемем илюзорна версия на света с 24 кадъра в секунда, е наука и магия наведнъж. Връзката на Хуго с Мелиес не е за това, че той се сприятелява с нов татко, а споделяйки общ ентусиазъм, който старецът е потънал в горчивина. За мен това е далеч по-уникален ъгъл на потенциално изтъркано помещение.<br/><br/>Наистина ли не намерихте Хюго за очарователен? Дори и малкото злосторници на филма изглежда са готови да признаят, че поредиците, напомнящи историята на киното и студиото на Мелиес – с Майкъл Щулбарг като героичния филмов учен! – бяха страхотни. Чувствах, по най-добрия възможен начин, като опияняваща компресия на моя клас History Of Film 101 в колежа, кондензирайки един семестър от клипове и контекст в нещо между монтаж и анимирана изскачаща книга. И това говори за гениалния дизайн на филма, който така красиво наслоява фактите и фантазиите, че едновременно е история на Мелиес и раждането на киното, и просто един вид просто, разкошно произведено кинематографично чудо, което самият Скорсезе би обичал като дете. Слава богу, че Хюго не следва модела на Жьоне/Лурман и има "усещане за собствената си нелепост". Като фентъзи ценител на себе си, не би ли казал, че има смисъл да се играе направо и сериозно и невъзмутимо, вместо да се намигва на публиката? Може да намерите Хюго за болезнено сладък, но не мисля, че автентичността на неговото чувство е да се отрече.<br/><br/>Реклама<br/><br/>Таша: Да, аз всъщност намерих части от Уго очарователни. (Забележете как отговарям на въпроса ви отпред, докато вие сте били твърде заети с пяна с апоплексия, за да се обърнете към моята, макар че предполагам, че това е отговор сам по себе си. Добре, "влияние" може би преувеличава случая - просто исках да кажа, че визуалният стил изглеждаше много познат. Въпреки че, както Кийт посочи, когато повдигна това лично, Скорсезе нито е против да черпи вдъхновение от визуалните ефекти на други хора, нито е имунизиран срещу него.) На първо място, бях очарован от частите, които се занимават с предисторията на Жорж Мелиес, с любовта му към киното, с работата, която влага в изкуството си и радостта, която получава от него. Има страшно много красота и забавление в постановката на сцената на подводния корт от "Приказната страна" на Мелиес и в последователността в края, фокусирайки се върху кадрите на Мели. Признавам, че връзката на Хюго с Мелиес, заради споделената любов към филма, е приятна и се наслаждавам на добър филм за правенето на филми.<br/><br/>Но Хюго не е преди всичко за филма, въпреки вратовръзките на Мелиес. В допълнение към темите, които цитирате, става дума и за намиране на вашата цел, както героите изрично, усърдно обясняват един на друг и на нас. И е за зрелище, и големи екшън сцени, и гонитби, и щастливо-вечни окончания, където дори гневният побойник и срамежливата по-възрастна двойка и фергаудсакета, дори и раздразнителният дакел се сдвояват с очарователни любовни интереси до края. Става дума за супер-скъпоценната Хърмаяни Грейнджър-тип, която е властна и наперена и умна и възхвалява магическите светове, обвити в книги. И всичко това е много познато и много изкуствено.<br/><br/>Реклама<br/><br/>Да, Скорсезе си играе с архетипи. Проблемът е, че никога не съм чувствал, че ги е наситил с нещо ново, свежо или правдоподобно, въпреки собствената си предистория. Много бих предпочел история за млад Скорсезе, израснал с астма – нещо дребно и истинско, без огромни стаи, пълни с часовников механизъм CGI и златни светещи прашни муцуни и пророчески сънища, и разярен възрастен тиранин-пазител със златно сърце – всички тези огромни, над най-горните безсмислици. Продължаваш да цитираш личното минало на Скорсезе и любовта му към филма като доказателство, че той наистина усеща това, което поставя на екрана, но аз не чувствам личното му докосване в нищо от това, с изключение на моментите, които са изрично за филма. Основните емоции може да са истински, но това не прави екзекуцията по-малко фалшива.<br/><br/>Казвате, че автентичността на емоцията не може да бъде отречена. Не се съмнявам, че Скорсезе лично се е чувствал самотен и изолиран като дете, но не чувствам самота и изолация на екрана – виждам куп преувеличени означаващи (Хуго е мръсен и дрехите му са износени и всички възрастни му викат и той редовно е преследван от страшно куче!) и големи удари, с викове и плач и Спилбъргови чудаци. За мен искреността е по-убедителна и по-лична, когато е тиха и директна; когато някой ми крещи мнението си, предполагам, че той е или наистина ядосан, или просто се опитва да надвие сетивата ми, за да ме спре да изразя собственото си мнение. Хюго беше един дълъг вик, що се отнася до мен.<br/><br/>Реклама<br/><br/>Защо не получих това чувство за фалшификация от Амели? Напълно признавам, че Амели и Мулен Руж са едновременно големи, манипулативни, изкуствени конструкции в една и съща жилка, изискващи специфични емоции на определени интервали и опитващи се да продадат тези емоции с тежко емотиране и агресивно саундтракиране. Никой от тях не ме продаде на емоциите си като автентично човешко чувство. Това, което ми хареса в тези два филма, беше конструкцията – особено опияняващите, смешни списъци на Амели, характеризиращи случайни черти и преживявания за нейния актьорски състав, и музикално-магическите миксове и реконтекстуализации на Мулен Руж. Често ме продават истории, които правят креативни или амбициозни неща със структура, и двата филма се класират, където Хюго е много по-линеен, стандартен детски куест.<br/><br/>Но в крайна сметка, за мен, наистина се свежда до усещането, че тези филми са глуповати, докато Хюго е предназначен да бъде приеман сериозно във всеки един момент. Не мислите, че това е вярно, но едновременно с това защитавате целостта му от гледна точка на абсолютно автентичната му, вкоренена в историята емоция на Скорсезе, и ми казвате, че греша и той не иска да бъде приеман сериозно. Как съчетавате тези две твърдения? Какво за филма ви подсказва, че той не е предназначен да бъде взет по номинална стойност? И възможно ли е това да е просто още един любопитен случай на Бенджамин Бътън, в който намирам използването на деца в високобюджетни филми за до голяма степен сапи и мелодраматични, докато ти като баща го намираш за заобикалящо цинизма ти и отиваш направо към семейното си чувство?<br/><br/>Реклама<br/><br/>Скот: Не съм сигурен, че имах предвид, че Скорсезе не означава да бъде взет на сериозно; просто той е избрал причудливо превозно средство, чрез което да изрази сериозна любов към филмите. Когато казвате: "Но Хюго не е преди всичко за филма, въпреки вратовръзките на Мели", аз съм озадачен. Приемам, че намирате много елементи на Хюго прекалено познати и трудолюбиви и пълни със спилбъргови чудаци – нищо не мога да направя, за да споря около това възприятие, което споделят и други съмняващи се Хюго. Понякога един филм означава да очароваш и омагьосваш, а за някои не; ти имаш Уго и аз имаме Амели, макар че мисля, че последното, колкото и изкуствено да е, означава за нас да го намираме за романтично. (Вместо, да кажем, някаква ужасна механична измишльотина годни за продължение Saw.)<br/><br/>Но да се каже, че Хюго не е преди всичко за филма? Ако не е за филма, тогава това е най-безсмислената дискусионна история за [каквото си мислите, че е за], която някога съм гледал. Връзката между Хюго и Мелиес е сърцето на филма, а в основата на това не е просто някаква стокова връзка между Plucky Orphan и Crusty Old Guy With A Heart Of Gold, а споделен афинитет към инженерната магия – по-специално магията на филмите. Мисля, че Скорсезе и неговите сътрудници са намерили начин да изразят ентусиазма си през ранните дни на киното чрез фантазия, която е достъпна за всички възрасти. Изпълнената с архетипи детска приказка е просто кората тук; киното е паят. (Ммм... пай.)<br/><br/>Реклама<br/><br/>Що се отнася до Любопитният случай на Бенджамин Бътън, аз не виждам голяма връзка, освен да се опитвам да ме разобличи като защитник на Бенджамин Бътън като начин да накърни доверието ми. (Между другото, как са екстрите на този G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra Blu-ray?) Казвал съм ви, че лишеният от сън нов баща в мен може би е бил уязвим за Бенджамин Бътън, но не мога да си представя време, когато предпоставката за стареенето в обратна посока няма да ме раздвижи. И освен това, не виждам как Бенджамин Бътън се свързва много с Хюго като филм за деца, тъй като това е само малка част от една история, която обхваща много по-голяма траектория.<br/><br/>Е, убедих ли те? Вероятно не. Но съм щастлив да науча, че Хюго не е бил напълно лишен от очарования за теб. Поредиците на Мелиес, режисьорът, са това, което постави Хюго над мен - и в това, най-малкото, можем да споделим малко филмова любов.<br/><br/>Реклама<br/><br/>Таша: Не, не мога да кажа, че си ме убедил, както не съм те убедил и теб. Невъзможно е да убедиш някого във висцерална любов към каквото и да е, и наистина би трябвало да е също толкова невъзможно да убедиш някого от висцерална любов. Най-вече, вие ми позволихте да видя Хюго в Scott-O-Vision, което е интересно преживяване; поне сега съм леко убеден, че не успяхме по някакъв начин да видим напълно различни филми, които по някакъв начин имаха едно и също име и режисьор.<br/><br/>Със сигурност обаче имахме различни преживявания и според мен се фокусирахме върху различни аспекти на продукцията: все още не виждам темата "филмът е прекрасен" като единичната нишка на филма, толкова колкото една сред твърде много. "Безсмислено дискусионен" почти го покрива, макар че бих добавил "често ненужно сладък и ценен" на всичкото отгоре. Докато ти се фокусираш върху вкусния пай на филма, имам чувството, че този пай е бил покрит с половин килограм кристализирана захар, и мисля, че това има значение, независимо от основното послание на филма или шепа страхотни сцени. Вижте също Бенджамин Бътън, който аз не повдигнах само за да ви развеселя – наистина мисля, че имате повече сантиментална жилка, отколкото аз по отношение на децата в киното, особено когато те се използват повече като символи на уязвимост и невинност, отколкото като човешки герои. Хей, знаеш ли кой филм изобщо няма сладки широкооки мопети, носещи надежда в един циничен свят? G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra. Може би ще отида да гледам тези Blu-ray екстри. |
| "I hoped my daughter would be free from difficult and troubling times": Mee Mee's story as a refugee Mom<br/><br/>Hope in Times of Crisis: A Mother's Day Story<br/><br/>By Judith Santiago*<br/><br/>Mee Mee heard that the soldiers were coming. She took hold of her son and frantically joined the rest of the villagers who were running toward the Thai-Burmese border, where the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) was located. Her husband was in another village running in the opposite direction, Mee later learned. After the soldiers' pursuit ended, Mee returned home to her small village in Koechi, Burma.<br/><br/>During 1997-2000, Mee and thousands like her lived under the constant threat of violence from Burmese soldiers. Many people would take temporary refuge in the jungle, and return home to their village after soldiers left the area, just to do it all over again days later. About once a week, Mee and others would be on the move to avoid capture, rape, or death by soldiers.<br/><br/>During one incident, Mee's husband ran ahead of his wife to secure food for his family. Her husband was spotted by soldiers and shot. The bullet shattered a portion of his ribcage, leaving him severely wounded and in distress as he journeyed toward the jungle with his family for safety.<br/><br/>For three months, Mee's husband hid and moved the family with an exasperating wound at his side. He received no medical care, except for Mee's tending.<br/><br/>"I was afraid to return to Burma," Mee said through an interpreter. "I feared dying. I cried and cried every day," she continued.<br/><br/>Mee's husband eventually drew enough strength to walk five days toward a small village in Thailand where they learned the location of a hospital and a refugee camp. When Mee and her husband finally arrived at the hospital, he underwent immediate surgery and later recovered.<br/><br/>Symbol of Hope<br/><br/>Life in the jungle for those fleeing Burmese soldiers was indeed terrifying and difficult. Makeshift bamboo tents with only roof and floor coverings became suitable temporary dwellings. Many women including Mee gave birth to children in the jungle. Mee's then six-year-old son assisted in the delivery of his sister named Eh Ku Hser. Her name means love – cold – sweet. "Cold" in Burmese culture means so as to not pass through the fire of life, as heat represents troubled times.<br/><br/>"I hoped my daughter would be free from difficult and troubling times," said Mee. "I did not want her to go through what I had experienced," she continued.<br/><br/>For Mee, the birth of her daughter in the midst of darkness, torment and fear, was a symbol of hope for a new life to come. Hope in times of crisis, the very premise of the United Methodist Committee on Relief's (UMCOR) newly co-branded UMCOR-Prosperity Candle, is also the essence of that which candles shed light upon.<br/><br/>A New Beginning<br/><br/>With the help of UNHCR, hope for a new life did indeed materialize for Mee and her family when they resettled in West Springfield, Massachusetts. There, Mee met Moo Kho Paw, another woman who emigrated from Burma, and who was working at Prosperity Candle in Florence. The organization helps refugee women who have escaped areas of conflict rebuild their lives through the art of candle making. Moo Kho recommended that Mee join the organization, and Mee gladly accepted.<br/><br/>"I was excited to be out of the house," said Mee, "I was raised to believe that because I was a woman, my role was to remain at home and raise my family," she continued. "While many Burmese women want to do more for themselves, they are often encouraged to remain homemakers."<br/><br/>Today, Mee has plans to go into the candle-making business for herself and support her five children, but she expressed the need to learn English first.<br/><br/>"In the Thai refugee camp, we had education, but it was not so good," said Mee. "When I was a child, I wanted to go to school, but I was told to stay home because I was a woman. Now, I have hopes for my daughters to go to college and become doctors or policewomen," continued Mee.<br/><br/>Mee has struck an even balance in her life that she wishes others would have found—a simple, happy life where work, caring for family members and freedom of choice all have their place.<br/><br/>Support Refugee Women in the US<br/><br/>Share this Mother's Day story with your loved ones. And, when you purchase handmade candles by Mee, Moo Kho, and Naw, another Burmese refugee woman working at Prosperity Candle , know you are helping to support their livelihood as they rebuild their lives and those of their family members in the US. | "Надявах се дъщеря ми да бъде свободна от трудни и тревожни времена": Историята на Ми Ми като бежанка Мама<br/><br/>Надежда във времена на криза: История за Деня на майката<br/><br/>От Джудит Сантяго*<br/><br/>Ми Ми чу, че войниците идват. Тя хванала сина си и трескаво се присъединила към останалите селяни, които тичали към тайландско-бирманската граница, където се намирала Службата на Върховния комисариат на ООН за бежанците (ВКБООН). Съпругът й бил в друго село, бягащо в обратната посока, научил по-късно Мий. След като преследването на войниците приключило, Мий се върнала у дома в малкото си село в Коучи, Бирма.<br/><br/>През 1997-2000 г. Мий и хиляди като нея живеят под постоянната заплаха от насилие от бирмански войници. Много хора биха потърсили временно убежище в джунглата и биха се върнали у дома в селото си, след като войниците са напуснали района, само за да го направят отново дни по-късно. Около веднъж седмично Мий и други са в движение, за да избегнат пленяване, изнасилване или смърт от войници.<br/><br/>По време на един инцидент съпругът на Мий изтичал преди жена си, за да осигури храна за семейството си. Куршумът е разбил част от гръдния кош, оставяйки го тежко ранен и в беда, докато пътува към джунглата със семейството си за безопасност.<br/><br/>В продължение на три месеца съпругът на Мий се криел и премествал семейството с дразнеща рана до себе си.<br/><br/>"Страхувах се да се върна в Бирма", каза Мий чрез преводач. "Страхувах се да умра. Плаках и плаках всеки ден", продължи тя.<br/><br/>Съпругът на Мий в крайна сметка черпи достатъчно сила, за да върви пет дни към малко село в Тайланд, където научават местоположението на болница и бежански лагер. Когато Мий и съпругът й най-накрая пристигнаха в болницата, той претърпя незабавна операция и по-късно се възстанови.<br/><br/>Символ на надеждата<br/><br/>Животът в джунглата за бягащите бирмански войници наистина е бил ужасяващ и труден. Произволни бамбукови палатки само с покрив и подови настилки стават подходящи временни жилища. Много жени, включително и Мий, раждат деца в джунглата. Тогавашният шестгодишен син на Мий помага при раждането на сестра си на име Е Ку Хсер. Нейното име означава любов – студена – сладка. "Студено" в бирманската култура означава така, че да не преминава през огъня на живота, тъй като топлината представлява размирни времена.<br/><br/>"Надявах се, че дъщеря ми ще бъде свободна от трудни и тревожни времена", каза Мий. "Не исках тя да премине през това, което бях преживяла", продължи тя.<br/><br/>За Ми, раждането на дъщеря си в средата на тъмнина, мъки и страх, е символ на надежда за нов живот. Надежда във времена на криза, самата предпоставка на Обединения методистки комитет за взаимопомощ (UMCOR) новосформирана свещ UMCOR-Prosperity, също е същността на това, върху което свещите хвърлят светлина.<br/><br/>Ново начало<br/><br/>С помощта на ВКБООН надеждата за нов живот наистина се материализира за Мий и нейното семейство, когато те се преселват в Уест Спрингфийлд, Масачузетс. Там Мие се запознава с Му Кхо Пау, друга жена, емигрирала от Бирма, и която е работила в Просперитет Свещ във Флоренция. Организацията помага на бежанки, избягали от райони на конфликт, да възстановят живота си чрез изкуството на правенето на свещи. Му Кхо препоръчал Мий да се присъедини към организацията, а Мий с радост приел.<br/><br/>"Бях развълнувана, че съм извън къщата", каза Мий, "отгледана съм да вярвам, че тъй като съм жена, моята роля е да остана у дома и да отглеждам семейството си", продължи тя. "Докато много бирмански жени искат да направят повече за себе си, те често са насърчавани да останат домакини."<br/><br/>Днес Мий има планове да отиде в бизнеса за правене на свещи за себе си и да подкрепи петте си деца, но тя изрази необходимостта първо да научи английски.<br/><br/>"В тайландския бежански лагер имахме образование, но не беше толкова добро", каза Мий. "Когато бях дете, исках да ходя на училище, но ми беше казано да остана вкъщи, защото бях жена. Сега имам надежди дъщерите ми да отидат в колеж и да станат доктори или полицайки", продължи Мий.<br/><br/>Мий е постигнала равновесен баланс в живота си, който тя желае другите да са намерили – прост, щастлив живот, в който работата, грижата за членовете на семейството и свободата на избор имат своето място.<br/><br/>Подкрепа за жените бежанци в САЩ<br/><br/>Споделете тази история за Деня на майката с близките си. И когато купувате ръчно изработени свещи от Mee, Moo Kho и Naw, друга бирманска бежанка, работеща в Prosperity Candle , знайте, че помагате да се поддържа препитанието им, докато възстановяват живота си и тези на членовете на семейството си в САЩ. |
| The Precedency Essay<br/><br/>1562 words - 7 pages<br/><br/>Affirmative action is a government policy that gives opportunities to minorities, women, and any group who has been the victim of discrimination in the past. Affirmative action is the outcome of the 1960's Civil Rights movement, growing out of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 which outlawed discrimination based on race, ethnicity, or gender. It was the 1978 Supreme Court decision, The Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, which allowed for the use of race-based preferences as a means of fostering diversity, allowing affirmative action to be used in admissions policies. It was created with the intention to provide equal opportunities for members of minority groups in education and ...view middle of the document...<br/><br/>However, according to a 2007 report by the Pew Research Center, support for affirmative action among the American public has actually increased substantiallyin recent years, climbing from 58% in 1995 to 70% in 2007. Supporters of affirmative action make many arguments in support of affirmative action, in the hopes of getting others to see the genuine good that affirmative actin policies bring to our society. Supporters believe that affirmative action is more of a process rather than an admissions policy. Colleges and universities take the extra initiative to reach out to minority groups, encouraging them to apply. Colleges and universities offer additional financial aid and provide on-campus resources to help better the student's college education. Supporters also note the rising number of minority applications to colleges and universities due in part to affirmative action policies.<br/>Statistics have proven that when affirmative action is eliminated, such as when it was at Berkley College and UCLA in 1998, the minority student admissions fell 61 percent and 36 percent respectively, proving that affirmative action plays a major role in a minority students college admissions process. Affirmative action supporters also believe that diversity in higher education provides a better educational atmosphere for all students, personally and intellectually. If affirmative action were to be eliminated, there would be fewer minority students enrolled in colleges, causing diversity to be fairly slim. Affirmative action policies are also necessary in order to compensate for centuries of racial, economic, and social oppression. Individuals with a higher socioeconomic status have more opportunities than those of lower socioeconomic backgrounds. Supporters believe that certain racial or ethnic groups are disadvantaged because they are frequently in lower income households and consequently are not exposed to the same resources as students from higher socioeconomic classes. Advocates support the notion of competition between students based on merit, but argue that affirmative action compensates for economic differences. College graduates, who have benefitted from affirmative action, have also said that they received better jobs, earned more money, and overall live better lives because of the fortunate opportunities they received through affirmative action.<br/>Supporters of affirmative action continuously stress the severe importance of affirmative action, considering its contributions to enhancing both the college experience and society in general. However, opponents of affirmative action believe that the time has come to end affirmative action. Opponents believe affirmative action was created to ensure fair admission practices to bring change to a long period of racial discrimination. They believe the policy is outdated."It's time to pull the plug on race-based decision making," says Ward Connerly, a Sacramento, California businessman and lead organizer of...<br/><br/>Find Another Essay On The Precedency<br/><br/>754 words - 4 pages<br/>of the burden to continue prospering.

Утвърждаващото действие е резултат от движението за граждански права от 1960 г., което израства от Закона за гражданските права от 1964 г., който забранява дискриминацията въз основа на раса, етнос или пол. Това е решението на Върховния съд от 1978 г., The Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, което позволява използването на расови предпочитания като средство за насърчаване на разнообразието, което позволява да се използват положителни действия в политиките за прием. Тя е създадена с намерението да осигури равни възможности за членовете на малцинствените групи в образованието и ...view middle of the document...<br/><br/>Въпреки това, според доклад от 2007 г. на изследователския център Pew, подкрепата за утвърдителни действия сред американската общественост всъщност се е увеличила значително през последните години, като се е увеличила от 58% през 1995 г. до 70% през 2007 г. Поддръжниците на утвърдителното действие правят много аргументи в подкрепа на утвърдителното действие, с надеждата да накарат другите да видят истинското добро, което политиките на утвърдителното действие носят на нашето общество. Поддръжниците смятат, че положителното действие е по-скоро процес, отколкото политика на приемане. Колежите и университетите поемат допълнителната инициатива да достигнат до малцинствените групи, насърчавайки ги да кандидатстват. Колежите и университетите предлагат допълнителна финансова помощ и предоставят ресурси в кампуса, за да помогнат за по-доброто образование на студентите в колежа. Поддръжниците също така отбелязват нарастващия брой на малцинствените кандидатури за колежи и университети, дължащи се отчасти на утвърдителни политики за действие.<br/>Статистиката е доказала, че когато положителното действие е елиминирано, като например когато е било в Berkley College и UCLA през 1998 г., приемането на малцинствени студенти е спаднало съответно с 61% и 36%, доказвайки, че положителното действие играе основна роля в процеса на приемане на малцинствени студенти в колежа. Привържениците на афирмативните действия също смятат, че разнообразието във висшето образование осигурява по-добра образователна атмосфера за всички студенти, лично и интелектуално. Ако положителното действие бъде премахнато, ще има по-малко ученици от малцинствата, записани в колежи, което ще доведе до сравнително слабо разнообразие. Афирмативните политики за действие също са необходими, за да се компенсират вековете на расово, икономическо и социално потисничество. Индивидите с по-висок социално-икономически статус имат повече възможности от тези с по-нисък социално-икономически произход. Поддръжниците смятат, че определени расови или етнически групи са в неравностойно положение, защото те често са в домакинства с по-ниски доходи и следователно не са изложени на същите ресурси като учениците от по-високи социално-икономически класове. Защитниците подкрепят идеята за конкуренция между учениците, основана на заслуги, но твърдят, че утвърдителното действие компенсира икономическите различия. Завършилите колеж, които са се възползвали от утвърдителни действия, също са казали, че са получили по-добра работа, спечелили са повече пари и като цяло живеят по-добър живот поради щастливите възможности, които са получили чрез утвърдителни действия.<br/>Поддръжниците на утвърдителното действие непрекъснато подчертават сериозното значение на утвърдителното действие, като се има предвид неговият принос за повишаване както на опита на колежа, така и на обществото като цяло. Противниците на утвърдителното действие обаче смятат, че е дошло времето да се сложи край на утвърдителното действие. Опонентите смятат, че е създадено утвърдително действие, за да се гарантират справедливи практики за приемане, които да доведат до промяна на дълъг период на расова дискриминация. Те вярват, че политиката е остаряла."

Зрителите могат да избират своето преживяване при затъмнение с достъп до експертни дискусии и телескопични технологии или забавни дейности като дисков голф и семейни занаяти.<br/><br/>Натуралистът в резиденцията на USC Руди Манке посети зрителите на историческата подкова, за да сподели естеството на слънчевото затъмнение, което води до 2,5-те минути тоталност, започващи в 2:41 ч.<br/><br/>След като слънцето напълно се появи отново, университетът беше домакин на Eclipse Reception за изгряващи гимназисти и бъдещи дипломирани студенти.<br/><br/>В късния следобед училището по бизнес в Дарла Мур е домакин на безплатна публична лекция на д-р Крейг Робъртс, изтъкнат професор и старши физик в Националната лаборатория в Аргон, една от националните лаборатории за научни и инженерни изследвания на Министерството на енергетиката на САЩ. В дискусията си "Оставяне на божествената частица да почива", д-р Робъртс обсъжда Хигс бозон и защо той не може да се използва за идентифициране на източника на повече от 98 процента от видимата маса на Вселената.<br/><br/>Големият ден най-накрая приключи на стадион Уилямс Брайс, където посетителите можеха да се насладят на звездите на университета. Открита практика на футболния отбор Геймкок 2017 беше перфектният край на феноменален ден.<br/><br/>Открояване на историята<br/><br/>Посетителите на кампуса можеха да се смесят с експерти по затъмнението и всеки от близо и далеч беше поканен да сподели това преживяване веднъж в живота. Научете повече за това как приветствахме това историческо събитие:<br/><br/>Официалното местоположение на НАСА<br/><br/>За нас беше чест да бъдем обявени за официално място за гледане от НАСА. Зрителите в нашите 15 наблюдателни станции в кампуса се радваха на достъп до експерти, свързани със затъмнението, и други образователни възможности, докато безопасно се наслаждаваха на слънчевото затъмнение. |
| Birthdays<br/><br/>Some people in your organisation may not wish to give you their birth date. Infoodle allows you to remove the birth year of a person! To do this:<br/><br/>When Adding a Person click the Hide Year button to remove the year of birth for the person.<br/><br/>Alternatively, when Editing a Person find the date of birth field for your site. Click the Edit button, then click Hide Year and save.<br/><br/>Easy as that!<br/><br/>Note: A person who has their birth year removed won't appear in any reports regarding an age criteria and is classed as an adult because their date of birth is actually set to 1902! The date of birth field is normally found in the information section but may have been<br/>moved under a different tab by your administrator. | Рождени дни<br/><br/>Някои хора във вашата организация може да не желаят да ви дадат рождената си дата. Infoodle ви позволява да премахнете годината на раждане на човек! За да направите това:<br/><br/>При Добавяне на лице щракнете върху бутона Скриване на годината, за да премахнете годината на раждане за лицето.<br/><br/>Като алтернатива, когато Редактиране на лице намерите датата на раждане поле за вашия сайт. Щракнете върху бутона Редактиране, след което щракнете върху Скрий година и запишете.<br/><br/>Толкова е лесно!<br/><br/>Забележка: Лице, чиято година на раждане е премахната, няма да се появи в никакви доклади относно възрастови критерии и се класифицира като възрастен, защото датата им на раждане всъщност е зададена на 1902! Датата на раждане поле обикновено се намира в раздела за информация, но може да са преместени под различен раздел от вашия администратор. |
| Combinations<br/><br/>Combinations Are defenses against a punch, choreographed responses to different types of attacks. They have many names across the martial arts but (in my experience) every art has a version of them. This makes them different than forms because there are plenty of martial arts that have no forms. What makes there partner exercises so universal? Why practice a specific response when (in reality) timing, type of attack, size of the attacker, and a hundred other factors will make it so you never use that entire choreographed response? And finally, how can we practice for a real defense situation and avoid injury at the same time?<br/><br/>The universality of combinations is impressive, to say the least. Our style of Kenpo karate has a list of 108 combos that can be learned. (Most students only learn 20-30 though) In Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu you spend whole classes practicing arm bars and chokes, learning every subtlety to the move while your partner offers little to no resistance. Every boxer has spent hours in front of the bag and/or mirror throwing the same combination of punches until their body moves by reflex alone. Combinations are universal because we have no better way to introduce movement and then practice the subtle positions required to make them work. Hitting a small pressure point through clothing takes A LOT of practice, catching an arm bar with control requires a carefully placed hip and a sneaky setup, and a great combination is only useful if you can through it from a balanced and protected position. Can you think of a better way to gain these skills?<br/><br/>There is any number of factors that determine how you respond to an attack and whether in a sparring match or in a fight, I have NEVER used a full combination in my defense. Why, then, do we spend hours practicing them? We practice these choreographed responses because the objective is not to pull combination 8 out every time you see a hook punch but to show you one way of blocking it and then a possible way to follow it up. I have never chosen to use combination 3 in a reality situation but the block is one of my go-to moves. Combinations add tools to the toolbox they do not fix the car.<br/><br/>The last question is a question of safety. If we practice for the sake of reality we need to replicate reality. How do we prevent injury while doing so? When it comes down to it, it's about building trust. We start slow and learn to trust that we have control over ourselves. We learn to trust our partners have control as well. In more time we learn to trust our control over our partner and (a little scarier) we learn to trust our partner's control over us. In the end (with a lot of practice) you can move are full speed, tossing your partner, and being thrown without fear of injury.<br/><br/>Combinations are universal for a reason; they are practiced so they can be dissected into their parts, and we stay safe by starting slow and building trust. As with everything else in the martial arts, combinations have many reasons behind their practice and execution. | Комбинации<br/><br/>Комбинации са защити срещу удар, хореографирани отговори на различни видове атаки. Те имат много имена в бойните изкуства, но (според моя опит) всяко изкуство има версия на тях. Това ги прави различни от формите, защото има много бойни изкуства, които нямат форми. Какво прави там партньорските упражнения толкова универсални? Защо да практикувате конкретен отговор, когато (в действителност) времето, вида на атаката, размера на нападателя и сто други фактори ще го направят така, че никога да не използвате целия хореографиран отговор? И накрая, как можем да практикуваме за реална отбранителна ситуация и да избегнем нараняване в същото време?<br/><br/>Универсалността на комбинациите е най-малко впечатляваща. Нашият стил на карате Kenpo има списък от 108 комбинации, които могат да бъдат научени. (Повечето ученици обаче учат само 20-30) В бразилското джиу-джицу прекарвате цели класове, практикувайки ленти за ръце и дросели, научавайки всяка тънкост на движението, докато партньорът ви предлага малко или никаква съпротива. Всеки боксьор е прекарал часове пред чантата и/или огледалото, хвърляйки една и съща комбинация от удари, докато тялото му се движи само с рефлекс. Комбинациите са универсални, защото нямаме по-добър начин да въведем движение и след това да практикуваме фините позиции, необходими, за да ги накараме да работят. Удрянето на малка точка на натиск през облеклото изисква много практика, хващането на лента за ръце с контрол изисква внимателно поставена тазобедрена става и подла настройка, а чудесна комбинация е полезна само ако можете да я преминете от балансирана и защитена позиция. Можете ли да измислите по-добър начин да придобиете тези умения?<br/><br/>Има редица фактори, които определят как реагирате на атака и дали в спаринг мач или в бой, НИКОГА не съм използвал пълна комбинация в моя защита. Защо тогава прекарваме часове в практикуването им? Ние практикуваме тези хореографирани отговори, защото целта не е да извадите комбинация 8 всеки път, когато видите удар с кука, а да ви покаже един начин да го блокирате и след това възможен начин да го проследите. Никога не съм избирал да използвам комбинация 3 в реална ситуация, но блокът е един от моите ходове. Комбинации добавят инструменти към кутията с инструменти, които не поправят колата.<br/><br/>Последният въпрос е за безопасността. Ако практикуваме в името на реалността, трябва да възпроизведем реалността. Как да предотвратим нараняването, докато го правим? Когато се стигне до това, става въпрос за изграждане на доверие. Започваме бавно и се научаваме да вярваме, че имаме контрол над себе си. Научаваме се да вярваме, че нашите партньори също имат контрол. С повече време се научаваме да се доверяваме на нашия контрол над партньора си и (малко по-страшно) се научаваме да се доверяваме на контрола на партньора си над нас. В крайна сметка (с много практика) можете да се движите с пълна скорост, да хвърляте партньора си и да бъдете хвърлени без страх от нараняване.<br/><br/>Комбинации са универсални за причина; те се практикуват, така че те могат да бъдат разчленени на техните части, и ние оставаме в безопасност, като започнем бавно и изграждане на доверие. Както и при всичко останало в бойните изкуства, комбинациите имат много причини за тяхната практика и изпълнение. |
