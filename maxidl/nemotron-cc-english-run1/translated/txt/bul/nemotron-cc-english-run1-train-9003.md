| The Masterpiece: a Chain Poetry Challenge<br/><br/>John has been writing poetry since his school days. He was awarded the "Best Poet 2014 and 2021" Hubby Awards.<br/><br/>Madame Monet in a Japanese kimono, 1875<br/><br/>Claude Monet [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>A Brief History of Collaborative, Collective, or Chain Poetry<br/><br/>Collaborative,collective, or chain poetry is an alternative and creative technique for writing poetry by more than one person. The principal aim of this type of poetry is to create poems through the collaboration of various authors/poets, trying to form a unified voice while still maintain their individual voices.<br/><br/>Examples of collaboration abound in Japanese poetry. Though the precise accounts and records of many such events are either lost or missing.<br/><br/>One of the most famous examples of collective poetry writing was the poem collection titled Ralentir Travaux by Surrealist French poets André Breton, Paul Éluard and René Char. These three poets collaborated to write the poems in this collection over just five days in 1930.<br/><br/>During the 1940s, Charles Henri Ford, an American poet, invented what he called the "chain poem", where each poet wrote a line and then sent the poem to another person (to continue) in another part of the world, by post.<br/><br/>In 2007 a collection of American collaborative poetry Saints of Hysteria: A Half-Century of Collaborative American Poetry was edited and published by Denise Duhamel, Maureen Seaton and David Trinidad.<br/><br/>Collaborative poetry writing has been used in schools and colleges to teach students teamwork and to discover ways in which they are connected.(source: Wikipedia)<br/><br/>Study of a Figure Outdoors: Woman with a Parasol, facing left, 1886<br/><br/>Claude Monet [Public domain or Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>The Aim of This Article and How to Approach the Challenge<br/><br/>A few years back I wrote an article called "Poem Without an End" which included a Christmas poem I had written that lent itself to being added to. I was amazed by the response as at that stage I only had a few followers here. People wrote a stanza of poetry each in "comments" on the hub to follow on from the previous commenter's stanza. It worked out very well and at the end I compiled all the contributions into a single poem as part of the hub.<br/><br/>Similar challenges have been issued since, including one by Frank Atanacio called "Spirits Sat as Mourners" that was also very successful. The difference being that in that instance contributors wrote their own hubs for their stanza of poetry and placed a link on Frank's original hub.<br/><br/>For this particular challenge I don't expect everyone to spend valuable time writing separate hubs for one stanza of poetry (unless you really want to). The main problem being that to make it effective you would have to copy the previously written parts of the poem onto your hub and would probably be hit with "duplication" label.<br/><br/>So, that being the case, and also to save having to leave links everywhere, I just ask that anyone who wants to take part just write their stanza here in "comments." Check the last comment before yours that is contributing to the challenge and follow on. If I see more than one following from the same stanza I will use my poetic licence to work them in as I deem best.<br/><br/>At some stage when I feel there has been enough stanzas added I will probably call an end to the challenge and then compile them all together as the completed poem as part of the article (also giving credit to each contributor).<br/><br/>Flowered Riverbank, Argenteuil<br/><br/>Claude Monet [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>The Challenge!<br/><br/>Now comes the interesting part. If you join this chain poetry challenge you have to try to keep the style and voice of the poem as close as possible to the preceding verses, so that to uninformed readers it will appear that only one author has written the entire poem.<br/><br/>Sounds easy, you say? Well maybe it would be if the poem had a traditional style, rhyme or meter. But this one doesn't! The poem you will be adding to was started by an acquaintance of mine Andriealphus as a "chain poem challenge" elsewhere. At the time of writing I was the only other person who had accepted the challenge, and because I loved the subject I thought it would be a great challenge for my fellow writers and decided to use it here and see if the response would be better. (I know of a few poets here whose writing would suit this style)<br/><br/>Rules :<br/><br/>Follow on from the previous stanza in comments<br/><br/>Try to retain the voice and style of the poem<br/><br/>Keep your stanza/verse to approximately the same length as those before<br/><br/>Claude Monet was one of the most famous painters in the history of art and a leading figure in the Impressionist movement.<br/><br/>In 1883 Monet moved to Giverny. Here, he loved to paint outdoors in the gardens that he helped create. The water lilies found in the pond had a particular appeal, and he painted several series of them throughout the rest of his life; the Japanese-style bridge over the pond became the subject of several works, as well.<br/><br/>In 1912 Monet painted a series of 12 waterlily paintings commissioned by the Orangerie des Tuileries, a museum in Paris. He chose to make them on a very large scale, and to serve as a "haven of peaceful meditation." This project consumed much of Monet's later years. Monet once stated, "These landscapes of water and reflection have become an obsession for me. It is beyond my strength as an old man, and yet I want to render what I feel."<br/><br/>His health was now an obstacle, as well. Nearly blind, with both of his eyes seriously affected by cataracts, Monet finally agreed to undergo surgery for the ailment in 1923.<br/><br/>Monet's famous water lilies turned redder as his cataracts progressed. After getting corrective surgery he destroyed most of the "red lily" paintings, angry that no one really mentioned it to him. Ironically, these paintings were probably what made his impressionistic style so famous in that time -- artists started taking more risks with color and such during this point. (source: biography.com)<br/><br/>The Masterpiece<br/><br/>"The boy sitting behind you says you look like a masterpiece.<br/><br/>Ask him, has he ever seen a Monet up close?<br/><br/>Close enough to see nothing but muddled strokes of weedy lakeshore?<br/><br/>Close enough to dip his fingers into the ridges<br/><br/>where oil paints hardened under an artist's gaze?<br/><br/>Close enough to breathe onto the blood lilies?<br/><br/>Ask him, why did he paint them red?" (Andriealphus)<br/><br/>He grinned like Carroll's cheshire cat.<br/><br/>"Through clouded and bloodshot eyes I imagine.<br/><br/>Be my waterlilies!" he says,<br/><br/>"Feel my breath and let my fingers delve,<br/><br/>become my masterpiece instead.<br/><br/>A brush has never touched a canvas as fine as your fair skin.<br/><br/>Let the masters weep in jealousy,<br/><br/>and Van Gogh slice his ear in envy at the beauty of your nakedness."(Jodah)<br/><br/>Self portrait with bandaged ear<br/><br/>Vincent van Gogh [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>Responses<br/><br/>Now it's your turn. Please write your response in the comments below, remembering to check those immediately before yours for the last written stanza of the poem. If you do decide to write a separate hub for your stanza of verse, make sure you leave a link here in comments.<br/><br/>The Finished Masterpiece<br/><br/>All contributions have been received and I have put the finished poem together with only some slight edits. I hope everyone is happy with the result. If you think I could improve the order of stanzas etc, feel free to let me know.<br/><br/>Comments<br/><br/>Hey Diana, looks like I have to go add another stanza to the finished poem :)<br/><br/>Thanks for this contribution.Quite beautiful.<br/><br/>Diana L Pierce from Potter County, Pa. on September 19, 2015:<br/><br/>No tears splash water below,<br/><br/>From the bridge beneath his feet,<br/><br/>Nor can his brush paint his thoughts,<br/><br/>From the mystery maid he seeks.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 21, 2015:<br/><br/>Thank you Cris, I am sure everyone appreciates your comment.

And the beauty we can still enjoy today from all his work.<br/><br/>This is a great challenge! I am really looking forward to adding to this.<br/><br/>I first wanted to stop in and let you know that, up for sure. Shared too.<br/><br/>And thank you so much for all the challenges to help the rest of us, keep our mental energy flowing and giving it a work out! You are the best.<br/><br/>The information about LuLu and the free ISBN number is an answered prayer! So, smile my friend. You are a gift!<br/><br/>Hugs. :-)<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 12, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi again Marj. I think I may have all the verses that are going to come. I have been doing my best to arrange them as I think best with just a little editing. I will probably post the finished poem as a separate hub with a link on this one to it. My book is available on Lulu and iBooks...there's a link on one of the earlier comments. I'd really appreciate it if you were to purhase a copy. Bear in mind it's my first eBook so the formatting etc isn't perfect, but it's taken me seven revisions I think to get it where it is. It will all be easier next time. If you need help let me know.<br/><br/>travmaj from australia on August 12, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi John, you have certainly had some excellent responses to your challenge - I'm sure you'll fuse it altogether beautifully although I imagine a difficult task. I'm interested in your poetry books also - I really have to get my act together technologically - I'll try and check it all out...cheers -<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi Jo, both books 'On the Wings of Eagles" and "I Laughed a Smile" have mostly the same content...except the former has one extra poem. Originally they were in different formats, one ePub, the other PDF but now they are both ePub. They are available through Lulu and iBooks, soon Barnes and Noble and Nook (not Amazon). I may try publishing another book through Amazon soon just to see how it compares. Thanks again.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>John, thanks a lot, the info on publishing with Lulu will be quite useful as I'm thinking of publishing but I'm currently torn between Amazon and Lulu. I wanted to purchase one of your books, but I couldn't seem to find them on Amazon. However, I'll probably get it from Lulu. Wishing you every success, you deserve it.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Hey Phyllis, thanks for ontributing. I like it, a perfect ending to the poem I think.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks Faith.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi Jo, I think I have sorted out the poem satisfactorily. Just waiting to see if there is any more to add. Publishing with Lulu wasn't bad and now that I've done it once it will be easier next time. Getting the formatting to look right in the eBook was the hardest, though you and just type it in a word document and Lulu automatically produces the contents page and converts the document to ePub or PDF you can only use certain fonts and have to make sure the chapter names or poem titles are in Heading 1. They also provide a free ISBN number if you want. Overall it was easier than expected however.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Phyllis, this is succinct and beautiful, I love it. Shyron's did an excellent job also, I thought I'd already commented on her verse, but I hadn't.<br/><br/>Phyllis Doyle Burns from High desert of Nevada. on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Wonderful hub, great idea, Jodah. Here is one from me. Short but sweet. Hope it is okay:<br/><br/>And this the beauty be<br/><br/>From Masters past we see<br/><br/>Impressed upon the boy<br/><br/>Bestowed on her with joy<br/><br/>Faith Reaper from southern USA on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks John and Jo. You are kind. Jo, you have always been a brilliant poet. I, too, am looking forward to the end result after John does his magic to pull it all together.<br/><br/>I will share again to see if there are any more takers.<br/><br/>Blessings<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Faith, beautifully done, I find it incredible how someone with such limited vision can teach us so much about beauty, light and shadows. John, looking forward to reading the end result.<br/><br/>By the way, congtats on publishing your poems. How did you find the process of publishing with Lulu?<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks for your great submission Faith. No it's not too late, I'm still compiling the final poem so it should be up for all to see in a day or two.<br/><br/>Faith Reaper from southern USA on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi John,<br/><br/>I apologize for my late submission here to your wonderful challenge. I am off from work a couple of day and decided to give this a go while my husband is resting from knee surgery. If it does not meet with your standards, please feel free to not use it in your final poem or edit as you deem necessary.<br/><br/>Blessings always<br/><br/>Here it goes:<br/><br/>Confessions to friend Georges Clemenceau<br/><br/>Of light encapsulating both torment, joy<br/><br/>Fervent madness in analyzing colors<br/><br/>Consequential spontaneous creations<br/><br/>Season after season of obsession<br/><br/>Capturing different hues in a single moment<br/><br/>Attentive while strolling in Argenteuill<br/><br/>Brushwork bares masterpiece.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 09, 2015:<br/><br/>Just a shout out to see if anyone else still wants to contribute to this chain poem. I have started compiling the stanzas together but will leave it open for a couple more days in case anyone else is intending to join in. Thanks to all who have contributed.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 02, 2015:<br/><br/>Thank you Genna. It appears Monet is a favourite arist of many here. I hope you'll take part in this challenge too :)<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 02, 2015:<br/><br/>Thank you for a great contribution Shyron. This is a very nice verse. Well done.<br/><br/>Genna East from Massachusetts, USA on August 02, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi John...<br/><br/>I started to read this wonderful challenge (Monet is one of my favorite artists), then came back to finish reading some of the beautiful contributions that give this painting a stunning voice through perception and the senses.

I'm so glad you like my contribution. This is a very good idea, I know you'll have fun putting it all together. Take care and my best to you.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks Deb, yes I am impressed by the standard of submissions. I'm looking forward to putting it all together.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Yes Ann, it is good to see the poets among us take up the challenge with some great contributions so far. I just hope Imcan do it justice when it comes to putting it together.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Well done Jo. The word "sublime" comes to mind. I hoped all the poets would rise to the fore, and they have. Love it, thanks for contributing.<br/><br/>Deb Hirt from Stillwater, OK on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>I am excited to see what you end up with here. There are a number of fine poets rising to the challenge, so go to it!<br/><br/>Ann Carr from SW England on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Great one, Jo!<br/><br/>You've got everyone going, John! Rather you than me, putting all this together, but it's going to be a humdinger of a poem when it finally comes to an end - if it ever does! You've really started something.<br/><br/>Ann<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Ok, John here goes nothing! Following from Kim's. I hope it reads well.<br/><br/>And the boy began to walk away<br/><br/>But in his wake, I heard him say<br/><br/>"I took a trip to Orangerie<br/><br/>Where the ghost of Monet still abides<br/><br/>I sat right down and gazed awhile<br/><br/>Until I heard a soft voice cry.<br/><br/>"Have you ever seen a fluid dream?<br/><br/>Where light evolves into what it touch<br/><br/>Where serenity flows through cloudy veil<br/><br/>Where the magician's brush like lightening rush<br/><br/>Have you ever seen a sight sublime?<br/><br/>A child born of distorted illusion<br/><br/>This flowering pond that traps the light<br/><br/>That lift the heart and beckons the soul<br/><br/>An abstract pulchritude up close<br/><br/>Move back, behold; such tranquil delight."<br/><br/>I hope this is in line with what the others have done. Feel free to edit if needed. My best...<br/><br/>Jo.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Alrighty!<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Yes Jo, please do. Anyone is welcome to do more than one stanza. I may add another myself at some stage.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>John, I've decided to have a go, but it's about 16 lines, can I do it in two stanzas following on from Kim's wonderful submission? You can always edit it later.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on July 31, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi Jo, sorry to hear you are under the weather at the moment. I am not in a hurry to close this challenge so I'll keep it open until you are back firing on all cylinders and are able to contribute. You are one of the hubbers I was looking forward to getting a response from as I thought it would suit. Thank you for your kind words, and get well soon.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on July 31, 2015:<br/><br/>Wow! John I can't believe I almost missed your incredible challenged. This is something in which I would have loved to participate since Claude Monet is one of my all times favourite artist. Unfortunately, I must cry off. I'm a bit under the weather with a head full of cotton wool, or so it seems. If the challenge is still open when I get rid of this pesky flu I may give it a go, but I must say, the standard is exceptionally high. Maj took it to another level but all the submissions are brilliant. Kudos to you Andriealphus and the other writers who participated so far in this artistic and creative masterpiece.<br/><br/>My best always Jo.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on July 31, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi again Maj, glad this poem inspired you, and yes it beats watching the cricket especially with the Aussie batsmen performing badly in this third test. It will be an interesting exercise for me to fuse all the stanzas together but should be good.<br/><br/>travmaj from australia on July 30, 2015:<br/><br/>John, thank you, I'm most happy you like my offering. I found the poem intriguing and suddenly felt inspired to write my version in the same mode. I'm not sure I wrote a continuation from the stanza before (alwaysexploring) but I'm sure you will fuse it altogether when the time comes. Love all the responses. I haven't managed any creative writing for yonks, can't wait now to start over, just need some time. (beats watching the cricket too!!!) Cheers John, will be checking in -<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on July 30, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks for checking Dana. I am pleased with the quality of responses so far. I just have to wait and see how many more come in. The final,poem should be great.<br/><br/>Dana Tate from LOS ANGELES on July 30, 2015:<br/><br/>Just checking in to see how things are going, I can't wait for the finished product. I attended a poetry class and we did this also it was really fun.<br/><br/>ocfireflies from North Carolina on July 29, 2015:<br/><br/>John,<br/><br/>Thanks so much for providing the platform for without that it is easy to fall down.<br/><br/>; ) Kim<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on July 29, 2015:<br/><br/>Thank you Devika. I haven't seen you around in awhile, I hope all is well.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on July 29, 2015:<br/><br/>Beautiful work Kim. It will follow on perfectly from Maj's as you answered the GIverny question. I am so pleased with the quality of responses so far.<br/><br/>ocfireflies from North Carolina on July 29, 2015:<br/><br/>John,<br/><br/>I had sent this earlier before travmaj's awesome contribution, but maybe it still works (I did a little tweaking)<br/><br/>following as opposed to prior--don't know if<br/><br/>I am making any sense.

Награден е с наградите "Най-добър поет за 2014 и 2021 г." Hubby Awards.<br/><br/>Мадам Моне в японско кимоно, 1875 г.<br/><br/>Клод Моне [Обществено достояние], чрез Общомедия<br/><br/>Кратка история на съвместна, колективна или верижна поезия<br/><br/>Съвместната, колективна или верижна поезия е алтернативна и творческа техника за писане на поезия от повече от един човек. Основната цел на този тип поезия е да създава стихотворения чрез сътрудничеството на различни автори/поети, опитвайки се да формират единен глас, докато все още поддържат индивидуалните си гласове.<br/><br/>Примери за сътрудничество изобилстват в японската поезия. Въпреки че точните разкази и записи на много такива събития са или изгубени, или липсват.<br/><br/>Един от най-известните примери за колективно писане на поезия е стихосбирката, озаглавена Ralentir Travaux от сюрреалистичните френски поети Андре Бретон, Пол Елюар и Рене Шар. Тези трима поети си сътрудничат, за да напишат стиховете в тази колекция само за пет дни през 1930 г.<br/><br/>През 40-те години Чарлз Анри Форд, американски поет, изобретява това, което той нарича "верижна поема", където всеки поет пише ред и след това изпраща поемата на друг човек (за да продължи) в друга част на света, по пощата.<br/><br/>През 2007 г. сборник с американска съвместна поезия Saints of Hysteria: A Half-Century of Collaborative American Poetry е редактиран и публикуван от Денис Дюамел, Морийн Сийтън и Дейвид Тринидад.<br/><br/>Съвместното писане на поезия се използва в училищата и колежите, за да се научи учениците да работят в екип и да открият начини, по които са свързани.<br/><br/>Изследване на фигура на открито: Жена с чадър, обърната наляво, 1886 г.<br/><br/>Клод Моне [Обществено достояние или Обществено достояние], чрез Общомедия<br/><br/>Целта на тази статия и как да подходим към предизвикателството<br/><br/>Преди няколко години написах статия, наречена "Поема без край", която включваше коледна поема, която бях написал, която се отдаваше на добавяне. Бях изумен от отговора, тъй като на този етап имах само няколко последователи тук. Хората написаха по една строфа поезия всеки в "коментари" на хъба, за да следват от предишната строфа на коментатора. Тя се получи много добре и накрая събрах всички приноси в една поема като част от хъба.<br/><br/>Подобни предизвикателства са издадени оттогава, включително едно от Франк Атанасио, наречено "Spirits Sat as Morners", което също е много успешно. Разликата е, че в този случай сътрудниците пишат свои собствени хъбове за своята стихосбирка и поставят връзка към оригиналния хъб на Франк.<br/><br/>За това конкретно предизвикателство не очаквам всички да отделят ценно време за писане на отделни хъбове за една строфа поезия (освен ако наистина не искате). Основният проблем е, че за да стане ефективно, ще трябва да копирате по-рано написаните части от поемата на вашия хъб и вероятно ще бъдете ударени с етикет "дупликация".<br/><br/>Така че, това е така, а също и за да спестите да оставяте връзки навсякъде, просто моля всеки, който иска да участва, просто да напише своята строфа тук в "коментари". Проверете последния коментар преди вашия, който допринася за предизвикателството и следвайте. Ако видя повече от един, който следва от една и съща строфа, ще използвам поетичния си лиценз, за да ги работя, както смятам за най-добре.<br/><br/>На някакъв етап, когато почувствам, че има достатъчно добавени строфи, вероятно ще призова края на предизвикателството и след това ще ги събера всички заедно като завършена поема като част от статията (също така ще дам заслуга на всеки сътрудник).<br/><br/>Цветен речен бряг, Argenteuil<br/><br/>Клод Моне [Обществено достояние], чрез Общомедия<br/><br/>Предизвикателството!<br/><br/>Сега идва интересната част. Ако се присъедините към това верижно поетично предизвикателство, трябва да се опитате да държите стила и гласа на стихотворението възможно най-близо до предходните стихове, така че за неинформираните читатели да изглежда, че само един автор е написал цялото стихотворение.<br/><br/>Звучи лесно, казваш? Е, може би щеше да бъде, ако стихотворението имаше традиционен стил, рима или метър. Но това не е така! Поемата, която ще добавите, е започната от мой познат Андриалф като "верижно предизвикателство за стихотворение" другаде. По време на писането бях единственият друг човек, който беше приел предизвикателството и понеже ми хареса темата, реших, че ще бъде голямо предизвикателство за моите колеги писатели и реших да го използвам тук и да видя дали отговорът ще бъде по-добър. (Познавам няколко поети тук, чието писане би подхождало на този стил)<br/><br/>Правила:<br/><br/>Следвайте от предишната строфа в коментарите<br/><br/>Опитайте се да запазите гласа и стила на стихотворението<br/><br/>Поддържайте вашата строфа/версия приблизително на същата дължина като тези преди<br/><br/>Клод Моне е един от най-известните художници в историята на изкуството и водеща фигура в импресионистическото движение.<br/><br/>През 1883 г. Моне се премества в Живерни. Тук той обича да рисува на открито в градините, за които е помогнал да се създадат. Водните лилии, открити в езерото, имат особена привлекателност и той рисува няколко серии от тях през останалата част от живота си; японският мост над езерото става обект и на няколко произведения.<br/><br/>През 1912 г. Моне рисува серия от 12 картини с водни лилии, поръчани от музея Orangerie des Tuileries в Париж. Той избира да ги направи в много голям мащаб и да служи като "пристан за мирна медитация". Този проект погълна голяма част от по-късните години на Моне. Моне веднъж заяви, "Тези пейзажи на вода и отражение са се превърнали в мания за мен. Това е отвъд силата ми като възрастен човек, и все пак искам да рендирам това, което чувствам."<br/><br/>Здравето му вече също е пречка. Почти сляп, с двете си очи, сериозно засегнати от катаракта, Моне най-накрая се съгласява да се подложи на операция за заболяването през 1923 г.<br/><br/>Известните водни лилии на Моне стават по-червени с напредването на катарактата му. След като получава коригираща операция, той унищожава повечето от картините на "червените лилии", ядосан, че никой не му го споменава. По ирония на съдбата, тези картини вероятно са били това, което е направило неговия импресионистичен стил толкова известен по това време - художниците започнали да поемат повече рискове с цвета и такива по време на тази точка.<br/><br/>Шедьовърът<br/><br/>"Момчето, което седи зад теб, казва, че приличаш на шедьовър.<br/><br/>Попитай го, виждал ли е някога Моне отблизо?<br/><br/>Достатъчно близо, за да не видите нищо друго, освен кални удари по плевелния езерен бряг?<br/><br/>Достатъчно близо, за да потопи пръстите си в хребетите.<br/><br/>където маслените бои се втвърдяват под погледа на художника?<br/><br/>Достатъчно близо, за да диша върху кръвните лилии?<br/><br/>Питай го, защо ги е боядисал в червено?" (Андриалф)<br/><br/>Усмихна се като котката на Керъл.<br/><br/>"През замъглени и кръвожадни очи, предполагам.<br/><br/>Бъдете мои водни лилии!", казва той,<br/><br/>"Почувствай дъха ми и остави пръстите ми да се ровят,<br/><br/>вместо това да стане мой шедьовър.<br/><br/>Четката никога не е докосвала платно толкова фино, колкото светлата ти кожа.<br/><br/>Господарите да плачат от ревност,<br/><br/>и Ван Гог наряза ухото си от завист към красотата на твоята голота."<br/><br/>Автопортрет с превързано ухо<br/><br/>Винсент ван Гог [Обществено достояние], чрез Общомедия<br/><br/>Отговори<br/><br/>Сега е ваш ред.

Направих всичко възможно, за да ги подредя, тъй като мисля, че най-добре само с малко редактиране. Вероятно ще публикувам завършената поема като отделен център с връзка към този към него. Книгата ми е на разположение на Lulu и iBooks... има връзка към един от по-ранните коментари. Наистина ще оценя, ако направите копие. Имайте предвид, че това е първата ми електронна книга, така че форматирането и т.н. не е перфектно, но ми отне седем ревизии, които мисля, че ще го получат там, където е.

Първоначално те бяха в различни формати, един EPUB, другият PDF, но сега и двамата са EPUB. Те са достъпни чрез Lulu и iBooks, скоро Barnes и Noble и Nook (не Amazon). Може да се опитам да публикувам друга книга чрез Amazon скоро, само за да видя как се сравнява. Благодаря отново.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues от Линкълншър, Великобритания на 11 август 2015 г.:<br/><br/>Джон, благодаря много, информацията за публикуването с Лулу ще бъде доста полезна, тъй като мисля да публикувам, но в момента съм разкъсан между Amazon и Lulu.

Просто чакам да видя дали има още какво да добавя. Публикуването с Лулу не беше лошо и сега, след като го направих веднъж, ще бъде по-лесно следващия път. Получаването на форматирането, за да изглежда правилно в електронната книга, беше най-трудното, въпреки че вие и просто го въведете в документ с думи и Лулу автоматично произвежда страницата със съдържанието и преобразува документа в EPUB или PDF, можете да използвате само определени шрифтове и трябва да се уверите, че имената на главите или заглавията на стихотворенията са в функция 1.

Аз съм малко под времето с глава, пълна с памучна вата, или поне така изглежда. Ако предизвикателството е все още отворено, когато се отърва от този досаден грип, може да го пробвам, но трябва да кажа, че стандартът е изключително висок.

| First of all EEQT itself needs to be further developed in order to provide a theoretical and computational answer to the needs of modern quantum engineering<br/>and technology. We need to include classical systems with infinite<br/>numbers of degrees of freedom - like electromagnetic and/or gravitational<br/>field. We also need to include infinite quantum systems so as<br/>to understand and simulate Bose gas and its phase transitions. But, there<br/>are also steps that must be taken far beyond the paradigm of EEQT.<br/>As we have emphasized so many times: quantum theory has yet<br/>to be understood in terms of a "non-linear classical theory." But what we mean by a "classical theory" is something much more advanced and more<br/>general than clasical mechanics or classical field theory. By a "classical theory" we mean first of all, a theory that is not based<br/>on probabilities from the start; a theory in which probabilities appear at a<br/>later stage, derived from the theory; derived perhaps, in a necessary way. Such a theory must not only specify the mathematical objects and their relations but also make "predictions".<br/>A classical theory is, in particular, a theory in which discrete events can happen, events that are "objective." They may be events that affect mainly the physical stratum, but they may be also "mental<br/>events," changes of states of "consciousness;" whatever they are, even if they<br/>are concerned with branchings of universes, - they DO HAPPEN.<br/>Such a theory, encompassing the quantum theory as we know it today,<br/>does not yet exist, but we can envisage its possible shape. Nothing serves better than an example, so let us give here an example of how<br/>such a theory can be construed.<br/>Imagine a theory developed a'la Einstein's unified field theory, but<br/>with variable metric signature, possibly with a complex causal web, multiple<br/>Einstein-Rosen [40] (see also [41]) bridges,<br/>time loops, nondifferrentiability, fractal structure, all of that additionally complicated by variable dimensionality of space and of "time" (cf [42]. Imagine such a theory to be able to accomodate all the four fundamental<br/>forces known to us, but it also involves an extra field, which is different<br/>from physical fields, and which is non-local in the sense that it does not<br/>survive taking a macro-average-limit when causal space-time<br/>structure of Einstein's general relativity is recovered. This extra field<br/>would be a place for "thought forms" and our theory would couple these<br/>thought forms to more "physical" levels of reality. The very concept of<br/>"time" would arise only in one particular limiting structure. Nothing<br/>prevents a theory of such a type to have mathematical structures rich enough to accomodate consciousness and mind. Due to its complexity,<br/>density of time-loops, bubble-like causal structure, making predictions<br/>in such theory is possible only by applying probability -<br/>as it is the case with systems evolving according to deterministic<br/>but chaotic dynamics. Quantum wave function would emerge in such a<br/>theory as an effective way of predicting. That type of explanation<br/>of quantum indeterminism was postulated long ago by I. J. Good. In<br/>[3] he speculated that<br/>quantum indeterminism can be understood if we admit that individual quantum events that actually happen here and now have future<br/>advanced causes as well has past retarded causes.<br/>A glimpse of such a thought<br/>may have occured to Alan Turing when he wrote his famous, already quoted sentence: "prediction must be linear, description must be nonlinear."<br/>A theory going partially in this direction is being developed by L. Nottale<br/>[43] who states the observation, attributed to Feynman, that "the typical paths of quantum mechanical particles are continuous non-differentiable." Then he continues his development of fractal<br/>space-time ideas to conclude with: "The quantum behavior becomes, in this theory,<br/>a manifestation of the fractal geometry of space-time, in the same way gravitation is, in Einstein's theory of general (motion-)relativity, a manifestation of the curvature of space-time.<br/>Another step in this direction comes from the work of Russian scientists - which started with the most original ideas of N.A. Kozyrev [44]<br/>and A. Sakharov [45], and is being developed in Moscow, the Urals and Siberia, see e.g. [46, 47, 48]. | На първо място самата EEQT трябва да бъде доразвита, за да се осигури теоретичен и изчислителен отговор на нуждите на съвременното квантово инженерство и технология. Трябва да включим класически системи с безкраен брой степени на свобода - като електромагнитно и/или гравитационно поле. Също така трябва да включим безкрайни квантови системи, за да разберем и симулираме газа Босе и фазовите му преходи. Но има и стъпки, които трябва да бъдат предприети далеч отвъд парадигмата на EEQT.<br/>Както сме подчертавали толкова много пъти: квантовата теория все още не е разбрана от гледна точка на "нелинейна класическа теория". Но това, което имаме предвид под "класическа теория" е нещо много по-напреднало и по-общо от класическата механика или теория на полето. Под "класическа теория" имаме предвид преди всичко теория, която не се основава на вероятности от самото начало; теория, в която вероятностите се появяват на по-късен етап, изведени от теорията; получени може би по необходим начин. Такава теория трябва не само да конкретизира математическите обекти и техните отношения, но и да направи "предсказания".<br/>Класическата теория е по-специално теория, в която могат да се случат дискретни събития, събития, които са "обективни". Те могат да бъдат събития, които засягат главно физическия слой, но те могат да бъдат и "ментални събития", промени на състоянията на "съзнанието"; каквото и да са те, дори и да се занимават с разклонения на вселените, те се случват.<br/>Такава теория, обхващаща квантовата теория, каквато я познаваме днес, все още не съществува, но можем да си представим нейната възможна форма. Нищо не служи по-добре от един пример, така че нека да дадем пример как може да се тълкува такава теория.<br/>Представете си, че една теория развива единна теория на полето на a'la Айнщайн, но с променлива метрична сигнатура, вероятно със сложна каузална мрежа, множествена<br/>Айнщайн-Розен [40] (вж. също [41]) мостове, времеви цикли, неразличимост, фрактална структура, всичко това допълнително усложнено от променливата измерение на пространството и на "времето" (вж. Представете си такава теория, за да може да приспособи всички четири фундаментални сили, които са ни известни, но тя включва и допълнително поле, което е различно от физическите полета и което е нелокално в смисъл, че не оцелява, приемайки макро-средна граница, когато се възстанови причинно-следствената пространствено-времева структура на общата относителност на Айнщайн. Това допълнително поле би било място за "мисловни форми" и нашата теория би свързала тези мисловни форми с по-"физически" нива на реалността. Самата концепция за<br/>"Времето" би възникнало само в една определена ограничаваща структура. Нищо не пречи на теория от такъв тип да има математически структури, достатъчно богати, за да настанят съзнанието и ума. Поради своята сложност, плътност на времевите цикли, подобна на мехур причинна структура, правенето на прогнози в такава теория е възможно само чрез прилагане на вероятност -<br/>както е при системите, развиващи се според детерминистичната, но хаотична динамика. Функцията на квантовата вълна би се появила в такава теория като ефективен начин за прогнозиране. Този тип обяснение на квантовия индетерминизъм е постулирано много отдавна от И. Дж.<br/>[3] той спекулира, че квантовият индетерминизъм може да бъде разбран, ако признаем, че отделните квантови събития, които всъщност се случват тук и сега, имат и бъдещи напреднали причини, има и минали бавноразвиващи се причини.<br/>Един поглед на такава мисъл може да се е появил на Алън Тюринг, когато е написал прочутото си, вече цитирано изречение: "прогнозата трябва да е линейна, описанието трябва да е нелинейно".<br/>Теория, която върви частично в тази посока, се разработва от L. Notale.<br/>[43] който заявява наблюдението, приписвано на Файнман, че "типичните пътища на квантовите механични частици са непрекъснати недиференцируеми". След това той продължава развитието си на фрактално пространствено-времеви идеи, за да завърши с: "Квантовото поведение става, в тази теория, проява на фракталната геометрия на пространство-времето, по същия начин гравитацията е, в теорията на Айнщайн за общата (motion-)relativity, проява на кривината на пространство-времето.<br/>Друга стъпка в тази посока идва от работата на руските учени - която започва с най-оригиналните идеи на Н.А. Козирев [44].<br/>и А. Сахаров [45], и се развива в Москва, Урал и Сибир, вж. напр. [46, 47, 48]. |
| Best Nutrition And Exercise For Lose Weight<br/><br/>How is breakfast really healthy?<br/><br/>In the morning like an emperor, at noon like a king, in the evening like a beggar – goes a well-known proverb. A study by the medical organization Endocrine Society confirms the key message behind the saying: It shows that breakfast plays a more important role than is often assumed. In the morning, the human body actually has more than twice as high a metabolic activity as at other times of the day: A large breakfast not only keeps you full for a long time, blood sugar and insulin levels also rise slowly. The appetite for sweets is regulated, we eat snacks less often during the day. Therefore, breakfast should not be skipped even during a diet.<br/><br/>Of course, having a big breakfast doesn't mean that we should have several croissants with nut nougat cream and sweet breakfast pancakes in the morning. Breakfast is healthy best when it is high in protein and fiber, as well as providing vitamins and minerals. Whole grain bread or muesli, oat flakes, fruits and nuts are energy suppliers that are good for you and keep you full for a long time.<br/><br/>The fact that a large breakfast is better than a large dinner does not necessarily mean that breakfast is essential for losing weight. A meta-analysis carried out in 2019 showed, that the total daily energy intake of people who eat breakfast is on average higher, than that of those who do not have breakfast. The latter were on average just under half a kilo lighter. So, according to the results of this major study, you don't necessarily have to eat breakfast if you want to lose weight.<br/><br/>Lose weight with the right diet – that's how easy it is to put healthy on your plate<br/><br/>Eating healthy in no way means less taste. Fresh vegetables, fish or meat as protein sources and other healthy ingredients conjure up taste in the pot and a smile on your lips – ideally also when you step on the scales. A US study has shown that people who cook their own food and consciously deal with what they eat have a body mass index in the normal range. Restaurant visits or fast food, on the other hand, quickly lure you into the sugar trap: Often there is no indication of how much sugar is in salad dressings, how much fat the potatoes were fried in or whether the meat was not treated.<br/><br/>A healthy lunch consists of three parts – the largest part is fruits or vegetables and should cover half of the plate. A quarter of the meal should consist of protein, i.e. fish, meat or tofu. The remaining quarter consists of carbohydrates and is ideally made from whole grain products. Important: Don't eat at your desk in the office, but stimulate your metabolism and ideally take a short walk before or after lunch.<br/><br/>When should you eat to lose weight?<br/><br/>In the evening, you should focus on light meals that are rather low in carbohydrates. These are the least likely to cause insulin to skyrocket, which is good for our body. Vegetables, dairy products and nuts, for example, are well suited for this.<br/><br/>You should also be careful not to have dinner too late. It is best to have eaten until 7 p.m. – then the body can relax and prepare for the night. Sufficient sleep is important for healthy weight loss. A US study found that people who slept about eight hours a night had better fat deposits. So good night! Allow yourself more than six hours of sleep so that you can start the next day fit and refreshed.<br/><br/>Losing weight without exercise – is it really possible?<br/><br/>It would be so easy, if the dream weight could be achieved simply by lowering the calorie intake. But you probably know the wisdom that diet is only one side of the coin and exercise is the other. So nothing helps: Put on your sportswear and off you go!<br/><br/>Anyone who, in addition to the sports program such as jogging, walking or swimming, also lets the elevator go alone and takes the stairs, takes a little detour or uses the bike instead of the car, is doing wellis also called something good. Even simple walking is good for health. | Най-доброто хранене и упражнения за отслабване<br/><br/>Как закуската е наистина здравословна?<br/><br/>Сутрин като император, по пладне като цар, вечер като просяк – гласи известна поговорка. Изследване на медицинската организация Ендокринно общество потвърждава ключовото послание зад поговорката: Тя показва, че закуската играе по-важна роля, отколкото често се предполага. На сутринта човешкото тяло всъщност има повече от два пъти по-висока метаболитна активност, отколкото в други часове на деня: Голямата закуска не само ви държи сити за дълго време, нивата на кръвната захар и инсулина също се повишават бавно. Апетитът за сладкиши се регулира, ядем закуски по-рядко през деня. Ето защо закуската не трябва да се пропуска дори по време на диета.<br/><br/>Разбира се, като голяма закуска не означава, че ние трябва да имаме няколко кроасани с ядки нуга крем и сладки палачинки закуска на сутринта. Закуската е здравословна най-добре, когато е с високо съдържание на протеини и фибри, както и предоставяне на витамини и минерали.Цялото зърно хляб или мюсли, овесени люспи, плодове и ядки са доставчици на енергия, които са добри за вас и ви държат сити за дълго време.<br/><br/>Фактът, че голяма закуска е по-добре от голяма вечеря, не означава непременно, че закуската е от съществено значение за намаляване на теглото. Метаанализ, извършен през 2019 г., показа, че общият дневен прием на енергия на хората, които закусват, е средно по-висок, отколкото на тези, които не закусват. Последните са средно малко под половин килограм по-леки. Така че, според резултатите от това голямо проучване, не е задължително да закусвате, ако искате да отслабнете.<br/><br/>Отслабнете с правилната диета – това е колко лесно е да сложите здравословно в чинията си<br/><br/>Здравословното хранене по никакъв начин не означава по-малко вкус. Пресни зеленчуци, риба или месо като източници на протеини и други здравословни съставки предизвикват вкус в тенджерата и усмивка на устните ви – в идеалния случай и когато стъпвате на кантара. Американско проучване показва, че хората, които готвят собствената си храна и съзнателно се справят с това, което ядат, имат индекс на телесна маса в нормалния диапазон. Ресторант посещения или заведения за бързо хранене, от друга страна, бързо ви примамват в захар капан: Често няма индикация за това колко захар е в салатни превръзки, колко мазнини картофите са пържени в или дали месото не е обработено.<br/><br/>Здравословният обяд се състои от три части – най-голямата част са плодове или зеленчуци и трябва да покриват половината от чинията. Една четвърт от храната трябва да се състои от протеини, т.е. риба, месо или тофу. Останалата четвърт се състои от въглехидрати и в идеалния случай е направена от пълнозърнести продукти. Важно: Не яжте на бюрото си в офиса, а стимулирайте метаболизма си и в идеалния случай се разходете малко преди или след обяд.<br/><br/>Кога трябва да ядете, за да отслабнете?<br/><br/>Вечерта трябва да се съсредоточите върху леки ястия, които са с доста ниско съдържание на въглехидрати. Те са най-малко вероятно да причинят инсулин да скочи до небето, което е добре за нашето тяло. Зеленчуците, млечните продукти и ядките, например, са добре пригодени за това.<br/><br/>Също така трябва да внимавате да не вечеряте твърде късно. Най-добре е да сте яли до 19 ч. – тогава тялото може да се отпусне и да се подготви за нощта. Достатъчен сън е важен за здравословното отслабване. Проучване в САЩ установи, че хората, които са спали около осем часа на нощ, са имали по-добри мастни натрупвания. Така че лека нощ! Позволете си повече от шест часа сън, за да можете да започнете следващия ден годни и освежени.<br/><br/>Отслабване без упражнения – наистина ли е възможно?<br/><br/>Би било толкова лесно, ако теглото на съня може да се постигне просто чрез намаляване на приема на калории. Но вероятно знаете мъдростта, че диетата е само едната страна на монетата и упражнението е другото. Така че нищо не помага: Сложете си спортните дрехи и се махайте!<br/><br/>Всеки, който в допълнение към спортната програма като джогинг, ходене или плуване, също така позволява на асансьора да отиде сам и да се качи по стълбите, да направи малко отклонение или да използва мотора вместо колата, се справя добре също се нарича нещо добро. Дори простото ходене е полезно за здравето. |
| Why We Open Sourced the Anvil App Server<br/><br/>Why Open Source?<br/><br/>A little while ago, we open-sourced the Anvil App Server. The community reaction has been great, even a little overwhelming (yes, every reply to that announcement really did land in my inbox!). We've already incorporated a bunch of that feedback into our version 1.2 release. But we keep getting asked, " Why did you open-source such a core part of your product? "<br/><br/>Why do this at all?<br/><br/>Anvil is a tool that makes it as simple as possible to build a web app. We do that by enabling you to build the whole application in one language, Python.<br/><br/>Simple hosting is part of that.<br/><br/>The web platform is broken , and Anvil is our attempt to fix it. And, because there is so much complexity in deploying a web app, a cloud-hosted service was the best way to provide the simplicity we want. That way, you can build your app in the Anvil Editor, and make it live on the Internet with one click.<br/><br/>But we kept hearing from people who said, "that's great, but…"<br/><br/>"…but I need to run this on an offshore platform without reliable internet access"<br/><br/>"…but I want to package my app into an IoT device I sell"<br/><br/>or simply, "…but if I'm putting my eggs in this basket, how can I be sure I can still run my app in ten years' time?"<br/><br/>These are all good points! A cloud service isn't the right solution for everyone. If we want to serve these users, there's got to be some way for them to get their apps out of Anvil and run them locally, under their own complete control.<br/><br/>Open Source: Escape hatch, not an ejector seat<br/><br/>We believe in escape hatches, not ejector seats. At conferences, we sometimes get asked, "can I export this as a Flask+JS app?". Sure, it would be possible – we could generate a server package, compile the client-side Python to Javascript, and spit out a classic web app. But it would have serious drawbacks, because:<br/><br/>Not a comfy ride.<br/><br/>Code generation is an ejector seat. Generated code is better than nothing – at least you can edit it! But the moment you edit that code, you lose all the benefits of the system that generated it. If you're using Anvil because of its drag-and-drop editor and Python in the browser, why should our locally-hosted users have to use vim and Javascript?<br/><br/>So we did it the right way: we open-sourced Anvil's runtime engine. It's the same code that serves your app in our hosted service, and it represents your app the same way. You can edit your code with a text editor, run it, then git push it back into our online IDE. It's not an ejector seat: there's no explosive transition. It's an escape hatch: you can climb out, and climb right back in.<br/><br/>What about our business model?<br/><br/>Anvil was never meant to be one of those enterprise low-code systems that charge you $20/mo for each person who uses your app. Anvil is a developer tool. The apps you develop are yours. Enabling you to run them on a Raspberry Pi is cool, but it doesn't change our business model.<br/><br/>We're doing what we always were: We make and sell a development tool that makes it drastically simpler to build web applications. We provide hosting for Anvil apps. We offer the entire development-and-hosting platform on-site for enterprise customers. And, of course, we offer a free plan so that everyone can use Anvil for hobby or educational purposes – or to start building something and see how it goes.<br/><br/>We've open-sourced the Anvil App Server for the (relatively small) number of people who need it, and to provide the ultimate insurance policy. Sure, you can build an app with vim and host it yourself, without even registering an account with us (we've got docs to show you how!). But the Anvil Editor is the world's easiest way to build a web app, and our hosted service is the easiest way to deploy it – so that's what we expect most of our users to continue doing. And you can build with confidence, knowing that the open-source code is right there if you need it.<br/><br/>Try it yourself<br/><br/>If our development philosophy resonates with you, why not try Anvil yourself? | Защо отворихме сървъра за приложения на наковалня<br/><br/>Защо с отворен код?<br/><br/>Преди малко отворихме сървър за приложения на наковалня. Реакцията на общността беше страхотна, дори малко поразителна (да, всеки отговор на това съобщение наистина се приземи в моята пощенска кутия!). Вече включихме доста от тази обратна връзка във версия 1.2, но продължаваме да ни питат: "Защо отворихте толкова важна част от продукта си?"<br/><br/>Защо изобщо правиш това?<br/><br/>Anvil е инструмент, който го прави възможно най-просто да се изгради уеб приложение.Ние правим това, като ви дава възможност да се изгради цялото приложение на един език, Python.<br/><br/>Простият хостинг е част от това.<br/><br/>Уеб платформата е счупена и Anvil е нашият опит да я поправим. И тъй като има толкова много сложност при внедряването на уеб приложение, услугата, хоствана в облак, беше най-добрият начин да осигурим простотата, която искаме. По този начин можете да изградите приложението си в редактора на наковалня и да го направите на живо в интернет с едно кликване.<br/><br/>Но ние продължавахме да чуваме от хора, които казваха, "това е страхотно, но..."<br/><br/>"...но трябва да пусна това на офшорна платформа без надежден достъп до интернет"<br/><br/>"...но искам да опаковам приложението си в IoT устройство, което продавам"<br/><br/>или просто "...но ако слагам яйцата си в тази кошница, как мога да съм сигурен, че ще мога да управлявам приложението си след десет години?"<br/><br/>Това са всички добри точки! Облачната услуга не е правилното решение за всички. Ако искаме да обслужваме тези потребители, трябва да има някакъв начин те да извадят приложенията си от Наковалня и да ги стартират локално, под техен пълен контрол.<br/><br/>Open Source: Бягство люк, не катапулт седалка<br/><br/>Ние вярваме в аварийните люкове, а не в седалките на катапулта. На конференциите понякога ни питат: "Мога ли да експортирам това като приложение Flask + JS?". Разбира се, би било възможно – бихме могли да генерираме сървърен пакет, да компилираме Python към Javascript от страна на клиента и да изплюем класическо уеб приложение. Но това би имало сериозни недостатъци, защото:<br/><br/>Не е удобно возило.<br/><br/>Генерирането на код е ежекторна седалка. Генерираният код е по-добър от нищо – поне можете да го редактирате! Но в момента, в който редактирате този код, губите всички предимства на системата, която го е генерирала. Ако използвате Anvil заради неговия редактор с плъзгане и пускане и Python в браузъра, защо нашите локално хоствани потребители трябва да използват vim и Javascript?<br/><br/>Така че го направихме по правилния начин: отворихме двигателя на Анвил по време на работа. Това е същият код, който обслужва вашето приложение в нашата хоствана услуга и представлява вашето приложение по същия начин. Можете да редактирате кода си с текстов редактор, да го стартирате, след което git да го избутате обратно в нашия онлайн IDE. Това не е седалка за катапулт: няма експлозивен преход. Това е авариен люк: можете да се изкачите и да се върнете обратно.<br/><br/>Ами нашият бизнес модел?<br/><br/>Наковалнята никога не е била предназначена да бъде една от онези корпоративни системи с нисък код, които ви таксуват $ 20/mo за всеки човек, който използва приложението ви. Наковалнята е инструмент за разработчици. Приложенията, които разработвате, са ваши. Позволявайки ви да ги стартирате на Raspberry Pi е готино, но това не променя нашия бизнес модел.<br/><br/>Правим това, което винаги сме били: Правим и продаваме инструмент за разработка, който прави създаването на уеб приложения драстично по-лесно. Осигуряваме хостинг за приложения на Anvil. Предлагаме цялата платформа за разработка и хостинг на място за корпоративни клиенти. И, разбира се, предлагаме безплатен план, така че всеки да може да използва Наковалня за хоби или образователни цели – или да започне да строи нещо и да види как върви.<br/><br/>Ние имаме отворен източник на Anvil App Server за (относително малък) брой хора, които се нуждаят от него, и да се осигури крайната застрахователна полица. Разбира се, можете да създадете приложение с vim и да го хоствате сами, без дори да регистрирате акаунт при нас (имаме документи, които да ви покажат как!). Но редакторът на наковалнята е най-лесният начин в света за изграждане на уеб приложение, а хостваната от нас услуга е най-лесният начин да го разположим – така че това очакваме повечето от нашите потребители да продължат да правят. И можете да изградите с увереност, знаейки, че кодът с отворен код е точно там, ако имате нужда от него.<br/><br/>Опитайте сами.<br/><br/>Ако нашата философия за развитие резонира с вас, защо не опитате сами Anvil? |
