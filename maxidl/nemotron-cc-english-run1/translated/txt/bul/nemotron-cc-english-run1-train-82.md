In simple terms, the condition is characterized by: one develops a kidney disease and undergoes a kidney transplant and other diseases associated with acidic concentration in the blood and gout. In theory, the condition will occur even if the genetic change is inherited from one parent and sporadically occurs when there is no family history.<br/><br/>Common names of autosomal dominant interstitial kidney disease<br/><br/>The condition has other names as well namely: medullary cystic kidney disease, although this name is not used as much because most people suffering from this condition do not have medullary cysts. It is also referred to as juvenile hyperuricemic nephropathy. The disease tends to affect people of ages 20 to 50. The latter condition as aforementioned occurs in young children, something, which translate to get it from both parents.<br/>Cystic kidney disease is an inherited condition whereby the cysts in the centre of each kidney gradually lose their ability to function properly. Cysts refer to abnormal blisters of fluid in the kidney. The condition further scares the kidney making unable to concentrate the urine and as a result, producing too much urine. Its symptoms include excessive urination, salt cravings, weakness, confusion, bleeding, fatigue, frequent hiccups, low blood pressure, nausea and vomiting, headaches, pale skin, reduced sensation in the hands, weight loss among many others. Other complications include: anemia, ulcers, loss of bone density, infertility and other heart related problems.<br/>Its analysis incorporates blood tests to check for sodium levels and general kidney functions, urine tests to check the levels of concentration and other imbalances, x rays to check for the size of kidneys that may be altered owing to increased urine concentrations, renal biopsy and genetic testing to verify any genetic changes that might have taken place in due time.<br/>While the disease does not have a cut and dry treatment to it, one may focus on controlling measures, which include intake of fluids and salt to supplement the one lost as the disease progresses into latter stages. This also helps reduce dehydration. Other treatments include taking of prescribed medication and diet changes and minimal intakes of foods containing phosphorous and potassium. Further complications may also require one to have a kidney transplant. Basically, this is not a curable disease but rather a manageable once detected in the early stages.<br/><br/>The common yet different factor of Autosomal dominant interstitial kidney disease<br/><br/>Nephronophthisis and medullary cystic kidney disease are mainly grouped together because, in essence, they share the same features but with a slight difference in regards inheritance patterns to the former affecting children and the latter affecting young adults and older age groups. Similar features for both are ADH resistant urine concentration that leads to polyuria and polydipsia, anemia and renal diseases.<br/>The former aforementioned condition is Autosomal recessive accounting to 15% of chronic diseases and causes ESRD during early childhood while the latter is Autosomal dominant with a few sporadic new mutations and causes ESRD for people between the ages of 30 and 50. | Онлайн CPR Сертификация Блог<br/><br/>Дата: 23 юли 2014 г.<br/><br/>Автозомно-доминантното интерстициално бъбречно заболяване е рядка колекция от заболявания, засягащи известните функции на бъбрека. С прости думи, състоянието се характеризира с: човек развива бъбречно заболяване и претърпява бъбречна трансплантация и други заболявания, свързани с киселинна концентрация в кръвта и подаграта. На теория състоянието ще настъпи дори ако генетичната промяна е наследена от един родител и спорадично възниква, когато няма фамилна история.<br/><br/>Често срещани имена на автозомно-доминантно интерстициално бъбречно заболяване<br/><br/>Състоянието има и други имена, а именно: медуларна кистозна бъбречна болест, въпреки че това име не се използва толкова много, защото повечето хора, страдащи от това състояние, нямат медуларни кисти. Нарича се още ювенилна хиперурикемична нефропатия. Заболяването има тенденция да засяга хора на възраст от 20 до 50 години. Последното състояние, както бе споменато по-горе, се среща при малки деца, нещо, което се превежда, за да го получи от двамата родители.<br/>Кистозната бъбречна болест е наследствено състояние, при което кистите в центъра на всеки бъбрек постепенно губят способността си да функционират правилно. Кисти се отнасят до абнормни мехури от течност в бъбрека. Състоянието допълнително плаши бъбреците, което прави неспособно да концентрира урината и в резултат на това произвежда твърде много урина. Симптомите му включват прекомерно уриниране, солен глад, слабост, объркване, кървене, умора, чести хълцания, ниско кръвно налягане, гадене и повръщане, главоболие, бледа кожа, намалено усещане в ръцете, загуба на тегло и много други. Други усложнения включват: анемия, язви, загуба на костна плътност, безплодие и други проблеми, свързани със сърцето.<br/>Анализът му включва кръвни тестове за проверка на нивата на натрий и общите бъбречни функции, изследвания на урината за проверка на нивата на концентрация и други дисбаланси, рентгенови лъчи за проверка на размера на бъбреците, които могат да бъдат променени поради повишени концентрации на урина, бъбречна биопсия и генетични тестове за проверка на всички генетични промени, които може да са настъпили своевременно.<br/>Докато заболяването не разполага с нарязано и сухо лечение към него, човек може да се съсредоточи върху контролни мерки, които включват прием на течности и сол, за да допълнят загубения с напредването на болестта в по-късните етапи. Това също помага за намаляване на дехидратацията. Други лечения включват приемане на предписани лекарства и промени в диетата и минимален прием на храни, съдържащи фосфор и калий. По-нататъшните усложнения също могат да изискват трансплантация на бъбрек. По принцип това не е лечимо заболяване, а по-скоро управляемо веднъж открито в ранните етапи.<br/><br/>Общият, но различен фактор на автозомно-доминантно интерстициално бъбречно заболяване<br/><br/>Nephronophthisis и медуларна кистозна бъбречна болест са групирани главно заедно, защото, по същество, те споделят едни и същи характеристики, но с малка разлика по отношение на моделите на наследяване на първите, засягащи децата и последните, засягащи младите хора и по-възрастните възрастови групи. Подобни характеристики и за двете са резистентната на ADH концентрация на урина, която води до полиурия и полидипсия, анемия и бъбречни заболявания.<br/>Първото гореспоменато състояние е автозомно рецесивно отчитане на 15% от хроничните заболявания и причинява ESRD в ранна детска възраст, докато второто е автозомно доминиращо с няколко спорадични нови мутации и причинява ESRD за хора на възраст между 30 и 50 години. |
| Hobbes' vs. Locke's Account on the State of Nature<br/><br/>Topic: PhilosophyWords: 2539Pages: 9Aug 3rd, 2021<br/><br/>Hobbes and Locke are among the most influential political philosophers to ever write in English. The state of nature, which precedes the organization of the complex societies, is the common premise that both Hobbes and Locke share but interpret in different ways. The former views humans in their natural state as equally dangerous and free to pursue their egoistic goals unrestricted by the nonexistent notions of justice, which is why his natural state amounts to the "war of every man against every man" (Hobbes76). The latter, on the other hand, views humans in their original condition as equally valuable and restricts natural freedom by the idea of justice that requires not to harm others, which allows defining the state of nature as "mutual assistance and preservation" rather than war (Locke 15). The key difference between the two philosophers' accounts of natural state is that Locke uses ethical considerations while Hobbes does not, and it ultimately leads Hobbes to envisage a state exercising unlimited power over human beings, while Locke limits the government by the moral principles, which he considers a natural law.<br/><br/>Hobbes bases his assumptions regarding the state of nature on the fact that all people are roughly equal in their physical and mental capabilities. He admits that some individuals may demonstrate greater physical strength or superior intellect but insists that "when all is reckoned together, the difference between man and man is not so considerable" (Hobbes 74). Since humans are roughly equal in their capabilities, they also have similar hopes to attain their ends and satisfy their needs (Hobbes 75). As a logical outcome of this equality, when the people begin competing for scarce resources, no one may feel entirely secure in his or her possessions. Even if a mighty, cunning, and capable person succeeds in subjugating "the persons of all men he can," it still does not guarantee the ultimate security (Hobbes 75). As no human can obtain such superiority over the others that renders him or her utterly immune to their strength of intellect, no human can feel completely safe when surrounded by his or her equals. Hobbes' equality in the natural state is equality of fear, where all humans view each other as dangerous competitors.<br/><br/>Just as Hobbes, Locke considers all human beings to be fundamentally equal, but assigns a very different meaning to the term. From his perspective, it is not the equality of capabilities, but, rather, the equality of value. He opines that the people "promiscuously born to all the same advantages of nature" should logically enjoy the perfect equality among them, as there is no reason to consider anyone inherently more valuable (Locke 8). The only possible foundation for designating some people as superior to others would be if God "by any manifest declaration of his will, set one above another" (Locke 8). Since such divine sanction of superiority is absent, Locke concludes that the natural equality of all representatives of humankind is not to be called into question. Hobbes approaches equality pragmatically and stresses that people in their natural state are equally dangerous, but Locke employs an ethical approach and emphasizes that humans are equally valuable in God's eyes. This disagreement is but the first difference between the two authors based on the fact that Locke includes God as a premise into his political philosophy, while Hobbes does not.<br/><br/>Another characteristic feature of Hobbes' account of the natural state is his interpretation of liberty. According to Hobbes, the state of nature implies unlimited freedom to do whatever is necessary for one's continued existence. The philosopher defines liberty as "the absence of external impediments" in using one's abilities to attain one's goals (Hobbes 79). The primary purpose of every sentient being is to maintain its continued existence. As a consequence, Hobbesian freedom amounts to the unhindered opportunity to do anything that, in one's judgment, would be best suited to preserve one's life and possessions (Hobbes 79). The only limitation to liberty is that a person cannot do anything contradictory to sustaining his or her life or destroying "the means of preserving the same" (Hobbes 79). Apart from that, there are no boundaries, and everyone has "a right to everything, even to one another's body" if that furthers one's survival (Hobbes 80). Thus, natural liberty, as viewed by Hobbes, is the absence of externally enforced obstacles in pursuing one's right to everything to sustain and secure one's continued existence.<br/><br/>Locke also upholds the idea of natural liberty but, unsurprisingly, approaches it in a manner that is significantly different from that of Hobbes. As soon as he begins discussing liberty in the state of nature, he immediately notes that a state of freedom does not equate "a state of license" (Locke 9). The philosopher identifies two specific limitations to human freedom in the state of nature. The first one is identical to that introduce by Hobbes: however free and independent, a person nevertheless "has not liberty to destroy himself" (Locke 9). Yet the second limitation contradicts Hobbes' prepositions directly. According to Locke, every human being has a natural obligation not to "harm another in his life, health, liberty, or possessions" (9). Just as with his interpretation of equality, the author bases this assertion on ethical and religious grounds: people should preserve each other's existence since they are all creations of the same "omnipotent, and infinitely wise maker" (Locke 9). Thus, Locke's limits liberty in the natural state far more stringently than Hobbes by introducing the obligation to refrain from harming both oneself and the others.<br/><br/>The differences between the two authors also manifest in their accounts of justice in the natural state of humanity. As far as Hobbes is concerned, delineating just and unjust practices is merely the matter of the law. There is no jurisprudence in the state of nature, and the only law governing human beings in their original condition is a natural law that only obliges them to seek personal security. As a result, nothing can be unjust in the original state of the humankind: "notions of right and wrong justice and injustice" have no place and no meaning in the absence of the stringently enforced law (Hobbes 78). As long as the people use their virtually unlimited freedom to ruthlessly compete with each other for resources, to which they are equally entitled, they have no criteria to differentiate between just and unjust actions. Therefore, the Hobbesian state of nature defies the very idea of justice since the author interprets it as a mere function of the formalized and established law.<br/><br/>Locke assigns different meaning to justice and views it not so much in legislative as in the ethical terms. This paper already mentioned that, unlike Hobbes, Locke employs ethical notions and generally bases his political philosophy on moral rather than purely practical presumptions. Locke's natural law, unlike that of Hobbes, obliges human beings to take care of each other rather than simply leaving everyone to fend for themselves. As a result, there is a place for justice and injustice in his state of nature. The author points to this fact himself when noting that no one should deprive another of his or her life of the means of preserving it "unless it be to do justice on an offender" (Locke 9). This statement reveals with the utmost clarity that, according to Locke, there is justice in the state of nature, and, moreover, humans have to preserve it actively. The criterion of justice, which Hobbes' natural state lacks, is the second limitation on natural liberty imposed by Locke: an action is unjust if it constitutes an unwarranted threat to another person's life and possessions.<br/><br/>These differences in the two authors' treatment of equality, liberty, and justice or injustice culminate in their interpretation of the relationship between the state of nature and the state of war. From Hobbes's perspective, the two are synonymous, because the ruthless competition is the only logical outcome of putting people with equivalent capabilities and similar needs in an environment with limited resources. He states this connection outright: "if any two men desire the same thing, which nevertheless they cannot both enjoy, they become enemies" and are, therefore, in the state of war with each other (Hobbes 75). Yet since humans are numerous and all possess similar capabilities and needs, this competition manifests not only in the individual interactions but also on the level of humanity as a whole. As long as all humans have equal and unlimited rights to all resources and even to each other's bodies and lives, the state of nature is a war of "every man against every man" (Hobbes 76). This grim interpretation stems directly from Hobbes' portrayal of the state of nature as governed solely by the individuals' egoistic urges.<br/><br/>Locke, on the other hand, differentiates between the state of nature and the state of war and points out that, while they may occur simultaneously, it is no reason to identify one with the other. Locke's definition of the state of war is virtually identical to that offered by Hobbes. According to Locke, "he who attempts to get another man into his absolute power does thereby put himself into a state of war with him" (14). This explanation lines up perfectly with the Hobbesian notion that everyone's universal right to everything, including the other people's bodies and lives, leads to the state of war. Yet Locke refuses to equate the state of war and the state of nature precisely because he denies Hobbes' interpretation of natural freedom. Since Locke's natural state restrains people from harming each other through the second limitation of liberty, an attempt on another person's freedom is a transgression against the natural law. While for Hobbes, war is the humankind's condition by default, Locke portrays it as a perversion of the state of nature rather than its rule.<br/><br/>These differences in delineating the state on nature and its constituents, such as liberty, equality, justice, and war, pave the way to the authors contrasting portrayals of government. Based on his pessimistic assessment of the state of nature, the author of Leviathan concludes that, under conditions of war, there can be no definite hope for "living out the time which nature ordinarily alloweth men to live" (Hobbes 80). The solution is laying down the universal right to everything and leaving everyone "so much liberty against other men, as he would allow other men against himself" (Hobbes 80). The participants of the resulting social contract invest the unlimited liberties they have surrendered into a sovereign – the bearer of the supreme power whose purpose is to preserve the achieved status quo by punishing all transgressions against it. Sovereign's power is absolute: the ruler has the authority "to do whatsoever he shall think necessary" to promote peace between his subjects so that no one would assail another's life or property (113). Hobbes concludes that without such an unassailable figure entitled with the right to do anything to the subjects, there can be no peace and no guarantee of security.<br/><br/>While Locke agrees with the necessity of creating politically organized societies, he nevertheless opposes Hobbes' idea of the sovereign power as unlimited and unassailable. As mentioned above, Locke's state of nature is not nearly as dreadful as that painted by Hobbes because of the people's obligation to preserve not only themselves but each other as well. Therefore, the need for social contract arises not from the fear of the others, but from the sheer convenience. Small communities may not need numerous laws to solve conflicts and "officers to superintend the process," but larger associations find it advisable to institute governments for that purpose (Locke 57). Yet the power of the government cannot be unlimited because it would result in subduing the subjects to an "inconstant, uncertain, unknown, arbitrary will of another man" (Locke 17). Such a government would constitute a twofold violation of the natural law. By agreeing to another person's absolute power over his life, a subject would violate its first limitation prohibiting to harm oneself. As for the ruler, destroying another person's liberty would constitute direct harm and, as such, be contradictory to the second limitation.<br/><br/>As a direct continuation of his case for unlimited governmental authority, Hobbes denies the separation of powers as a principle. From his perspective, the sovereign, once instituted, possesses "the whole power of prescribing the rules" governing the lives of the subjects or, in shorter terms, the legislative power (Hobbes 114). The sovereign also reserves the right of "hearing and deciding all controversies" – that is, the judicial power (Hobbes 114). Finally, since the entire purpose of the sovereign is to force the subjects to refrain from harming each other, there can be no doubt that executive power is also his or her exclusive prerogative. The separation of powers as a concept is alien to Hobbes because of his views on the state of nature. Creating a political entity where the executive, legislative, and judicial branches would check each other – that is, compete – would mean recreating the Hobbesian state of nature-as-war on a higher level. Since the people enter a social contract and institute a government to put the state of nature behind them, not reinstate it in a different form, the separation of powers contradictory Hobbes' views directly.<br/><br/>Locke, on the other hand, embraces separation of power as a foundational principle of his political theory. His case for the separation is evident in the discussion of the limits of the legislative power. As Locke puts it, it would be hardly advisable "for the same persons, who have the power of making laws, to have also in their hands the power to execute them" (76). The philosopher points to the imperfections of human nature and the inherent desire to "grasp at power" as a rationale for this precautionary measure (Locke 76). Just as in Hobbes' case, Locke's account of the separation of powers stems directly from his interpretation of the state of nature. If there is already justice in the state of nature and the people can understand it, any government is inevitably subject to the same natural law. Since absolute power over people violates both limitations of this law, separating and distributing it is advisable so that the government would function appropriately.<br/><br/>This paper has demonstrated that, while the differences between Hobbes' and Locke's accounts of the natural state of humanity are numerous, they ultimately amount to the presence of absence of moral premises. Hobbes views the natural state as that of unlimited liberty, where people endowed with equal capabilities and not bound by any moral notions, such as justice, compete for the resources unceasingly. Locke, however, interprets equality and liberty ethically rather than practically and opines that war is a perversion of the natural state, as the natural law obliges humans not to harm each other. This disagreement influences the philosophers' approaches to government. Hobbes insists on an all-powerful ruler, as, in the absence of ethical restraints, no other authority could force the humans to refrain from harming each other. Yet, in Locke's view, granting the government unlimited powers would be contradictory to the ethical limitations embedded in the law of nature, which is why he, unlike Hobbes, advocates separation of powers. | Разказът на Хобс срещу Лок за състоянието на природата<br/><br/>Тема: ФилософияДуми: 2539Страници: 9Aug 3rd, 2021<br/><br/>Хобс и Лок са сред най-влиятелните политически философи, писали някога на английски език. Състоянието на природата, което предшества организацията на сложните общества, е общата предпоставка, че и Хобс, и Лок споделят, но интерпретират по различни начини. Първите разглеждат хората в естественото им състояние като еднакво опасни и свободни да преследват егоистичните си цели, неограничени от несъществуващите представи за справедливост, поради което естественото му състояние се равнява на "войната на всеки човек срещу всеки човек" (Хобс76). Последният, от друга страна, разглежда хората в първоначалното им състояние като еднакво ценни и ограничава естествената свобода с идеята за справедливост, която изисква да не се нараняват другите, което позволява да се определи състоянието на природата като "взаимна помощ и опазване", а не война (Locke 15). Ключовата разлика между разказите на двамата философи за естественото състояние е, че Лок използва етични съображения, докато Хобс не, и това в крайна сметка кара Хобс да си представи държава, упражняваща неограничена власт над човешките същества, докато Лок ограничава правителството с моралните принципи, които смята за естествен закон.<br/><br/>Хобс основава своите предположения относно състоянието на природата на факта, че всички хора са приблизително равни по своите физически и умствени способности. Той признава, че някои индивиди могат да демонстрират по-голяма физическа сила или по-висш интелект, но настоява, че "когато всичко е преценено заедно, разликата между човека и човека не е толкова значителна" (Хобс 74). Тъй като хората са приблизително равни в способностите си, те също имат подобни надежди да постигнат целите си и да задоволят нуждите си (Хобс 75). Като логичен резултат от това равенство, когато хората започнат да се конкурират за оскъдни ресурси, никой не може да се чувства напълно сигурен в своите притежания. Дори ако могъщ, хитър и способен човек успее да подчини "лицата на всички хора, които може", това все още не гарантира крайната сигурност (Хобс 75). Тъй като никой човек не може да получи такова превъзходство над другите, което го прави напълно имунизиран срещу тяхната сила на интелекта, никой човек не може да се чувства напълно сигурен, когато е заобиколен от неговите или нейните равни. Равенството на Хобс в естествено състояние е равноправие на страха, при което всички хора гледат един на друг като на опасни конкуренти.<br/><br/>Също като Хобс, Лок смята всички човешки същества за фундаментално равни, но придава много различно значение на термина. От негова гледна точка, това не е равенство на възможностите, а по-скоро равенство на стойността. Той е на мнение, че хората, "безразборно родени от всички същите предимства на природата", логично трябва да се радват на перфектното равенство между тях, тъй като няма причина да се смята някой по своята същност за по-ценен (Locke 8). Единствената възможна основа за определяне на някои хора като по-висши от другите би била, ако Бог "чрез всяко явно изявяване на волята си, постави един над друг" (Locke 8). Тъй като такава божествена санкция за превъзходство отсъства, Лок заключава, че естественото равенство на всички представители на човечеството не трябва да се поставя под въпрос. Хобс подхожда прагматично към равенството и подчертава, че хората в естественото им състояние са еднакво опасни, но Лок използва етичен подход и подчертава, че хората са еднакво ценни в Божиите очи. Това несъгласие е само първата разлика между двамата автори въз основа на факта, че Лок включва Бог като предпоставка в политическата си философия, докато Хобс не го прави.<br/><br/>Друга характерна черта на разказа на Хобс за естественото състояние е неговата интерпретация на свободата. Според Хобс, състоянието на природата предполага неограничена свобода да се прави каквото е необходимо за продължаващото съществуване на човек. Философът определя свободата като "отсъствието на външни пречки" при използването на нечии способности за постигане на нечии цели (Хобс 79). Основната цел на всяко съзнателно същество е да поддържа своето продължително съществуване. Вследствие на това, Хобсийската свобода се равнява на безпрепятствената възможност да се направи всичко, което по нечия преценка би било най-подходящо за запазване на нечий живот и притежания (Хобс 79). Единственото ограничение на свободата е, че човек не може да направи нищо противоречиво, за да поддържа живота си или да унищожи "средствата за запазване на същото" (Хобс 79). Отделно от това, няма граници и всеки има "право на всичко, дори и на тялото на другия", ако това спомага за оцеляването му (Хобс 80). По този начин, естествената свобода, както се разглежда от Хобс, е липсата на външно наложени пречки в преследването на правото на човек на всичко, за да поддържа и осигури продължаващото си съществуване.<br/><br/>Лок също поддържа идеята за естествена свобода, но, не е изненадващо, подхожда към нея по начин, който е значително по-различен от този на Хобс. Веднага щом започва да обсъжда свободата в състоянието на природата, той веднага отбелязва, че състоянието на свобода не се равнява на "състояние на лиценз" (Locke 9). Философът идентифицира две специфични ограничения на човешката свобода в състоянието на природата. Първото е идентично с това, въведено от Хобс: колкото и да е свободен и независим, човек все пак "няма свобода да се самоунищожи" (Locke 9). И все пак второто ограничение противоречи директно на предлозите на Хобс. Според Лок, всяко човешко същество има естественото задължение да не "наранява друг в живота, здравето, свободата или притежанията си" (9). Точно както и с неговата интерпретация на равенството, авторът основава това твърдение на етични и религиозни основания: хората трябва да запазят взаимно съществуването си, тъй като всички те са творения на един и същ "всесилен и безкрайно мъдър създател" (Locke 9). По този начин Лок ограничава свободата в естествено състояние много по-строго от Хобс, като въвежда задължението да се въздържа от нараняване както на себе си, така и на другите.<br/><br/>Различията между двамата автори се проявяват и в техните разкази за справедливостта в естественото състояние на човечеството. Що се отнася до Хобс, очертаването на справедливи и несправедливи практики е просто въпрос на закона. Няма съдебна практика в състоянието на природата и единственият закон, който управлява човешките същества в първоначалното им състояние, е естествен закон, който само ги задължава да търсят лична сигурност. В резултат на това нищо не може да бъде несправедливо в първоначалното състояние на човечеството: "бележки за правилна и грешна справедливост и несправедливост" нямат място и значение при липсата на строго прилагания закон (Hobbs 78). Докато хората използват практически неограничената си свобода, за да се конкурират безмилостно помежду си за ресурси, на които имат еднакво право, те нямат критерии за разграничаване между справедливи и несправедливи действия. Следователно Хобсовото състояние на природата противоречи на самата идея за справедливост, тъй като авторът я интерпретира като проста функция на формализирания и установен закон.<br/><br/>Лок придава различно значение на справедливостта и я разглежда не толкова в законодателно, колкото в етично отношение. Този документ вече споменава, че за разлика от Хобс, Лок използва етични понятия и като цяло основава политическата си философия на морални, а не чисто практически презумпции. Естественият закон на Лок, за разлика от този на Хобс, задължава човешките същества да се грижат един за друг, вместо просто да оставят всеки да се грижи за себе си. В резултат на това има място за справедливост и несправедливост в неговото състояние на природата. Авторът посочва този факт сам, когато отбелязва, че никой не трябва да лишава друг от неговия или нейния живот от средствата за запазването му "освен ако не е да се направи справедливост на нарушителя" (Locke 9). Това твърдение разкрива с най-голяма яснота, че според Лок има справедливост в състоянието на природата и освен това хората трябва да я запазят активно. Критерият за справедливост, който липсва в естественото състояние на Хобс, е второто ограничение на естествената свобода, наложено от Лок: едно действие е несправедливо, ако представлява неоправдана заплаха за живота и имуществото на друго лице.<br/><br/>Тези различия в отношението на двамата автори към равенството, свободата и справедливостта или несправедливостта кулминират в тяхното тълкуване на връзката между състоянието на природата и състоянието на война. От гледна точка на Хобс, двете са синоними, защото безмилостната конкуренция е единственият логичен резултат от поставянето на хора с равностойни възможности и сходни нужди в среда с ограничени ресурси. Той заявява тази връзка направо: "ако някой двама души желаят едно и също нещо, на което въпреки това не могат и двамата да се радват, те стават врагове" и следователно са в състояние на война един с друг (Хобс 75). И все пак, тъй като хората са многобройни и всички притежават подобни способности и нужди, тази конкуренция се проявява не само в индивидуалните взаимодействия, но и на нивото на човечеството като цяло. Докато всички хора имат равни и неограничени права върху всички ресурси и дори върху телата и живота на другите, състоянието на природата е война на "всеки човек срещу всеки човек" (Хобс 76). Тази мрачна интерпретация произтича директно от изобразяването на Хобс на състоянието на природата, управлявано единствено от егоистичните пориви на индивидите.<br/><br/>Лок, от друга страна, прави разлика между състоянието на природата и състоянието на война и посочва, че докато те могат да се появят едновременно, не е причина да се идентифицираме един с друг. Определението на Лок за състоянието на война е почти идентично с това, предложено от Хобс. Според Лок "този, който се опитва да вкара друг човек в абсолютната си власт, по този начин се поставя в състояние на война с него" (14). Това обяснение съвпада перфектно с Хобсийската представа, че всеобщото право на всеки на всичко, включително телата и живота на другите хора, води до състояние на война. И все пак Лок отказва да приравни състоянието на война и състоянието на природата именно защото отрича интерпретацията на Хобс за естествената свобода. Тъй като естественото състояние на Лок възпира хората да не си вредят един на друг чрез второто ограничаване на свободата, опитът за свобода на друг човек е нарушение на естествения закон. Докато за Хобс войната е състояние на човечеството по подразбиране, Лок я описва като извращение на състоянието на природата, а не на нейното управление.<br/><br/>Тези различия в очертаването на държавата по отношение на природата и нейните съставни части, като свобода, равенство, справедливост и война, проправят пътя на авторите, контрастиращи портрети на правителството. Въз основа на песимистичната си оценка за състоянието на природата, авторът на Левиатан заключава, че в условията на война не може да има определена надежда за "изживяване на времето, което природата обикновено позволява на хората да живеят" (Хобс 80). Решението е да се заложи всеобщото право на всичко и да се остави на всички "толкова свобода срещу другите хора, колкото той би позволил на другите хора срещу себе си" (Хобс 80). Участниците в получения социален договор влагат неограничените свободи, които са предали, в суверен – носителят на върховната власт, чиято цел е да запази постигнатото статукво чрез наказване на всички прегрешения срещу него. Властта на Суверена е абсолютна: владетелят има властта "да направи всичко, което сметне за необходимо", за да насърчи мира между поданиците си, така че никой да не напада живота или собствеността на друг (113). Хобс заключава, че без такава неопровержима фигура, която има право да прави каквото и да било на поданиците, не може да има мир и никаква гаранция за сигурност.<br/><br/>Докато Лок е съгласен с необходимостта от създаване на политически организирани общества, той все пак се противопоставя на идеята на Хобс за суверенната власт като неограничена и непревземаема. Както бе споменато по-горе, състоянието на природата на Лок не е толкова ужасно, колкото това, нарисувано от Хобс, поради задължението на хората да запазят не само себе си, но и себе си. Следователно нуждата от социален договор възниква не от страха на другите, а от чистото удобство. Малките общности може да не се нуждаят от множество закони за решаване на конфликти и "офицери за надзор на процеса", но по-големите асоциации смятат за препоръчително да въведат правителства за тази цел (Locke 57). И все пак властта на правителството не може да бъде неограничена, защото това би довело до подчиняване на субектите на "постоянна, несигурна, неизвестна, произволна воля на друг човек" (Locke 17). Такова правителство би представлявало двойно нарушение на естествения закон. Съгласявайки се с абсолютната власт на друг човек над живота си, даден субект би нарушил първото си ограничение, забраняващо да се наранява. Що се отнася до владетеля, унищожаването на свободата на друго лице би представлявало пряка вреда и като такова противоречи на второто ограничение.<br/><br/>Като пряко продължение на неговия случай за неограничена държавна власт, Хобс отрича разделението на властите като принцип. От негова гледна точка суверенът, веднъж създаден, притежава "цялата власт да предписва правилата", регулиращи живота на поданиците или, в по-кратки срокове, законодателната власт (Hobbes 114). Суверенът също така си запазва правото да "изслушва и решава всички спорове" – т.е. съдебната власт (Hobbes 114). И накрая, тъй като цялата цел на суверена е да принуди поданиците да се въздържат от взаимни вреди, не може да има никакво съмнение, че изпълнителната власт е и негово изключително право. Разделянето на силите като понятие е чуждо на Хобс поради неговите възгледи за състоянието на природата. Създаването на политическа единица, в която изпълнителната, законодателната и съдебната власт да се проверяват взаимно – тоест да се конкурират – би означавало пресъздаване на Хобсовото състояние на природата-като-война на по-високо ниво. Тъй като хората сключват социален договор и създават правителство, което да остави състоянието на природата зад себе си, а не да го възстанови в различна форма, разделението на властите противоречи пряко на възгледите на Хобс.<br/><br/>Лок, от друга страна, възприема разделението на властта като основополагащ принцип на политическата си теория. Неговата теза за разделението е очевидна при обсъждането на границите на законодателната власт. Както се изразява Лок, едва ли би било препоръчително "за същите лица, които имат властта да създават закони, да имат и в ръцете си властта да ги изпълняват" (76). Философът посочва несъвършенствата на човешката природа и присъщото желание да "хванеш властта" като обосновка за тази предпазна мярка (Locke 76). Точно както в случая на Хобс, разказът на Лок за разделението на силите произтича директно от неговата интерпретация на състоянието на природата. Ако вече има справедливост в състоянието на природата и хората могат да я разберат, всяко правителство неизбежно е подчинено на същия природен закон. Тъй като абсолютната власт над хората нарушава и двете ограничения на този закон, разделянето и разпространението му е препоръчително, така че правителството да функционира правилно.<br/><br/>Този документ показва, че докато разликите между разказите на Хобс и Лок за естественото състояние на човечеството са многобройни, те в крайна сметка се свеждат до липсата на морални предпоставки. Хобс разглежда естественото състояние като това на неограничена свобода, където хора, надарени с равни възможности и не обвързани с никакви морални представи, като например справедливост, се състезават за ресурсите неуморно. Лок обаче интерпретира равенството и свободата етично, а не практически и изказва мнението, че войната е извращение на естественото състояние, тъй като естественият закон задължава хората да не си вредят един на друг. Хобс настоява за всемогъщ владетел, тъй като при липсата на етични ограничения никоя друга власт не би могла да принуди хората да се въздържат от взаимни вреди. И все пак, според Лок, предоставянето на неограничени правомощия на правителството би било в противоречие с етичните ограничения, заложени в закона на природата, поради което той, за разлика от Хобс, се застъпва за разделение на властите. |
| Fashion Police: What Game of Thrones threw up<br/><br/>Canadian-French singer Abbas Hasan put blinding effort to outshine all of humanity at Fashion Parade 2014. Nothing wrong with that, except safety is priority and the musician is a health hazard here.<br/><br/>We get he wants to be a star. Sadly, he didn't get the memo where they tell the desperate and the infamous that stardom is a metaphor. You don't have to look like one and literally set our sight ablaze. Also, the All Pakistan Aunty Association has officially lodged a complaint against him. The local market has run dry of fake crystals and sequined monstrosities. They have nothing to wear to their biweekly high teas and they claim he is to blame. Apparently, the outfit is inspired by Game of Thrones. Can he please stick to composing sad songs about his neighbour's dead dog instead of conceptualising outfits? Or maybe it's the trauma of losing the dog, whose death he is clearly not over as he is still wearing its carcass.<br/><br/>The charge sheet Outfit<br/><br/>No one can decide where the outfit begins and where Abbas ends. You stare in fascination, sinking into a deep abyss and wonder why he is wearing leather pants. Whose horse did he kill to steal the saddle draped across his shoulders? Was he in prison right before his red carpet appearance and forgot to take off the chains? How will he survive the synthetic leather and post-sequin rash that is bound to be lethal in such high dosage? Why am I still alive?<br/><br/>Idea<br/><br/>His inspiration was seemingly Game of Thrones, but he eventually ended up looking like he was thrown out of a Viking restaurant. Had he come across any of the characters from the show, he would've been slain in the first five seconds of the first episode.<br/><br/>The mental health or lack thereof: Someone get him to a counsellor ASAP! He seems to be under the assumption that wearing a dead dog means that the only friend he had in his life is still alive. Dear Abbas:<br/><br/>1. Denial is not a river in Egypt<br/><br/>2. Your tortured psyche is not helping your music, so get help<br/><br/>3. Try imaginary friends<br/><br/>Bail out!<br/><br/>All of us at the Fashion Police headquarters are severely traumatised. Abbas is someone we did not enjoy arresting. He is currently in custody and attempting revenge by putting on attires from other fantasy shows. He just glitter glued himself in order to look like Edward Cullen from Twilight. As a public service message and to prevent further nervous breakdowns, we gave him the following examples of men from the red carpet of the same event.<br/><br/>Zohaib Hassan<br/><br/>When in doubt, play it safe. The singer looks like your average uncle at a shaadi. A plain black suit with no accessories, even if it's a tad disproportionate, is workable. Zohaib's look is blended into everything and nothing, and when you don't have a fashion sense or the money to hire a stylist, this is okay. It does not carry the risk of cardiac arrest for fellow attendees at an event. Given Abbas' delicate mental condition, this look is what he should aim for. Always and forever.<br/><br/>Ali Zafar<br/><br/>One day, after decades of therapy, Abbas could aspire to wear attire like Ali Zafar's. The dapper summer look is done to near perfection. Ali came really close to looking like a maître d at a French restaurant with his white summer jacket with black lapels, but the shirt saves it, never mind the satin. His pants would have been ridiculous had they not been folded at the ankles. The shoes are what hipster chic happy endings are made of. | Модна полиция: Каква игра на тронове повърна<br/><br/>Канадско-френската певица Абас Хасан положи ослепителни усилия да засенчи цялото човечество на Модния парад 2014. Няма нищо лошо в това, освен че безопасността е приоритет и музикантът е опасност за здравето тук.<br/><br/>За съжаление, той не е получил бележката, в която казват на отчаяните и скандалните, че звездното царство е метафора. Също така, All Pakistan Aunty Association официално е подала жалба срещу него. Местният пазар е пресъхнал от фалшиви кристали и пайети чудовища. Те нямат какво да носят на техните двуседмични високи чайове и те твърдят, че той е виновен. Може ли да се придържа към композирането на тъжни песни за мъртвото куче на съседа си, вместо да концептуализира тоалети? Или може би е травмата от загубата на кучето, чиято смърт очевидно не е приключила, тъй като той все още носи трупа му.<br/><br/>Чаршафът Outfit<br/><br/>Никой не може да реши къде започва облеклото и къде свършва Абас. Вие се взирате в очарование, потъвате в дълбока бездна и се чудите защо носи кожени панталони. Чий кон е убил, за да открадне седлото, драпирано през раменете му? Бил ли е в затвора точно преди появата си на червения килим и е забравил да свали веригите? Как ще оцелее след синтетичната кожа и обрива, който е обречен да бъде смъртоносен в такава висока доза? Защо съм все още жив?<br/><br/>Идея<br/><br/>Вдъхновението му изглеждало като Игра на тронове, но в крайна сметка той изглеждал като изхвърлен от ресторант на викингите. Ако попаднел на някой от героите от шоуто, той щял да бъде убит в първите пет секунди на първия епизод.<br/><br/>Психичното здраве или липсата на такова: Някой да го закара на съветник възможно най-скоро! Изглежда, че той е под предположението, че носенето на мъртво куче означава, че единственият приятел, който е имал в живота си, е все още жив. Скъпи Абас:<br/><br/>1. Отричането не е река в Египет<br/><br/>2. Вашата измъчвана психика не помага на музиката ви, така че потърсете помощ<br/><br/>3. Опитайте въображаеми приятели<br/><br/>Под гаранция!<br/><br/>Всички ние в щаба на модната полиция сме тежко травмирани. Абас е някой, който не ни хареса да арестуваме. В момента той е в ареста и се опитва да отмъсти, като си облече дрехи от други фантастични шоута. Той просто блести, за да изглежда като Едуард Кълън от "Здрач". Като послание за обществена служба и за да предотвратим по-нататъшни нервни сривове, му дадохме следните примери за мъже от червения килим на същото събитие.<br/><br/>Зохайб Хасан<br/><br/>Когато се съмнявате, играйте на сигурно. Певецът изглежда като обикновен чичо на шаади. Обикновен черен костюм без аксесоари, дори и да е малко непропорционален, е работоспособен. Погледът на Зохайб се смесва във всичко и нищо и когато нямаш моден усет или пари да наемеш стилист, това е добре. Той не носи риск от спиране на сърдечната дейност за събеседниците на събитие. Предвид деликатното психическо състояние на Абас, този поглед е това, към което трябва да се стреми.<br/><br/>Али Зафар<br/><br/>Един ден, след десетилетия терапия, Абас може да се стреми да носи облекло като това на Али Зафар. Али беше наистина близо до това да изглежда като маестро във френски ресторант с бялото си лятно яке с черни ревери, но ризата го спасява, да не говорим за сатена. Панталоните му щяха да са смешни, ако не бяха сгънати на глезените. Обувките са това, от което са направени хипстърските шик щастливи окончания. |
| Determining soil hydraulic properties with different wetting liquids : A thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the Degree of Master of Science at Lincoln University<br/><br/>Abstract<br/><br/>Soil hydraulic properties such as hydraulic conductivity, water retention and plant water relationships dominate the water movement processes. For example, the infiltration, evaporation and water flow within the soil. As a widespread phenomenon in soil, soil water repellency alters the soil hydraulic functions by resisting the water flow into the soils. Moreover, the hydraulic properties not only depend on the pore system of soil but also are affected by the physicochemical properties of the pore surfaces. Compared to water, ethanol is not affected by the water repellency due to its lower surface tension. The purpose of using ethanol is to eliminate the effect of soil water repellency on hydraulic properties measurements. However, applying pure ethanol into natural soil can degrade the soil organic materials and lead to changes in physical properties. Therefore, the aqueous ethanol solutions can be an alternative option. Nevertheless, the feasibility of using aqueous ethanol for determining soil liquid retention curve remains unknown. This study aims to test the feasibility of the aqueous ethanol solutions (0, 10 %, 20 %, 30 %, 40 %, 50 % and 100 % v/v) for establishing liquid retention curve under a small range of applied pressure in coarse sand samples with different wettability and organic amended natural soil (Templeton silt loam (TSL) with mushroom compost, biochar, dairy effluent, and municipal compost, the application rate was 15 % by weight). The result showed that the desorption of testing aqueous ethanol solutions compared to water was quicker by approximately 1 to 3x based on the liquid content at the same applied pressure and the time for reaching each equilibrium. The outcomes from the sand experiment suggested that when the concentration of aqueous ethanol solution was below 50 %, the losses via evaporation were less than 1% and the relative differences between testing liquid and water was lower than 10 %. However, the evaporation losses were 11.06 % and 24.6 %, and the relative differences were all around 15 % and 30 % in 50 % and 100 % ethanol solution, respectively. In contrast, the organic amendments in Templeton silt loam not only increased the water retention capability but also reduced the evaporation losses. The evaporation losses in TSL soil and TSL with organic amendments soil were with 1 % in solutions with less than 50 % ethanol content. Evaporation losses of 50 % and 100 % ethanol were 2.8 % and 2.9 %, respectively. The relative differences between water and testing liquid were similar to the sand experiment when the testing liquid concentrations were below 50 %. However, the relative differences in 50 % and 100 % ethanol solution were smaller than in the sand sample with around 10 % and 15%, respectively. Additionally, the analysis of relative difference suggested that almost all aqueous ethanol solutions had lower volumetric liquid content at the same supplied pressure compared to water, which was a reflection of the aqueous ethanol solutions desorbed faster than water under equivalent pressure. Therefore, 10 % to 40 % of ethanol solutions could be considered an alternative for determining soil hydraulic properties due to their faster desorption rate and not being affected by soil water repellency. Due to the evaporation and dissolution of organic material, aqueous ethanol solutions above 50% concentration were not suitable for coarse sand or medium-textured soil.... [Show full abstract] | Определяне на хидравличните свойства на почвата с различни овлажняващи течности : Дисертация, представена в частично изпълнение на изискванията за степен магистър в университета Линкълн<br/><br/>Абстракт<br/><br/>Почвените хидравлични свойства като хидравлична проводимост, задържане на вода и връзки с водата на растенията доминират в процесите на движение на водата. Например инфилтрацията, изпаряването и водният поток в почвата. Като широко разпространено явление в почвата, отблъскването на почвената вода променя хидравличните функции на почвата, като устоява на водния поток в почвите. Освен това, хидравличните свойства не само зависят от порестата система на почвата, но и се влияят от физикохимичните свойства на порите. В сравнение с водата, етанолът не се влияе от отблъскването на водата поради по-ниското си повърхностно напрежение. Целта на използването на етанол е да се елиминира ефекта на отблъскването на почвената вода върху измерванията на хидравличните свойства. Прилагането на чист етанол в естествена почва обаче може да влоши почвените органични материали и да доведе до промени във физическите свойства. Следователно водните разтвори на етанол могат да бъдат алтернативен вариант. Независимо от това, възможността за използване на воден етанол за определяне на кривата на задържане на течности в почвата остава неизвестна. Това изследване има за цел да провери осъществимостта на водните разтвори на етанол (0, 10 %, 20 %, 30 %, 40 %, 50 % и 100 % v/v) за установяване на кривата на задържане на течности под малък обхват на прилаганото налягане в проби от груб пясък с различна омокряемост и органична модифицирана естествена почва (Templeton silt loam (TSL) с гъбен компост, биочар, млечни отпадъчни води и общински компост, като процентът е 15 %). Резултатът показа, че десорбцията на тестването на водни разтвори на етанол в сравнение с водата е по-бърза с приблизително 1 до 3x въз основа на съдържанието на течност при същото прилагано налягане и времето за достигане на всяко равновесие. Резултатите от пясъчния експеримент предполагат, че когато концентрацията на воден разтвор на етанол е под 50 %, загубите чрез изпаряване са по-малко от 1%, а относителните разлики между тестването на течност и вода са по-ниски от 10 %. Загубите от изпаряване обаче са били 11,06 % и 24,6 %, а относителните разлики са били съответно около 15 % и 30 % при 50 % и 100 % разтвор на етанол. За разлика от тях органичните изменения в тинята на Темпълтън не само увеличават способността за задържане на вода, но и намаляват загубите от изпарение. Загубите от изпаряване в TSL почвата и TSL с органични изменения на почвата са с 1 % в разтвори с по-малко от 50 % съдържание на етанол. Загубите от изпаряване от 50 % и 100 % етанол са съответно 2,8 % и 2,9 %. Относителните разлики между водата и изпитваната течност са подобни на експеримента с пясъка, когато концентрациите на изпитваната течност са под 50 %. Въпреки това относителните разлики в 50 % и 100 % разтвор на етанол са по-малки, отколкото в пясъчната проба, съответно с около 10 % и 15 %. Освен това, анализът на относителната разлика предполага, че почти всички водни разтвори на етанол имат по-ниско обемно съдържание на течност при същото доставено налягане в сравнение с водата, което е отражение на водните разтвори на етанол, десорбирани по-бързо от водата под еквивалентно налягане. Следователно, 10 % до 40 % от разтворите на етанол биха могли да се считат за алтернатива за определяне на хидравличните свойства на почвата поради по-бързата им скорост на десорбция и не се влияят от отблъскването на почвената вода. Поради изпаряването и разтварянето на органичен материал, водните разтвори на етанол над 50% концентрация не са подходящи за груб пясък или среднотекстурирана почва.... [Покажи пълен абстрактен] |

| Want to plant tomatoes in June or July along the Southern California Coast but not sure the seasonal timing is right? Most tomatoes, peppers and eggplants, for example, require around 100 days to harvest, therefore you'd want to transplant those into the ground around September 3. The state of California is so large that some of its areas are divided into multiple U.S. Department of Agriculture plant hardiness zones. Otherwise, you will want to plant tomatoes in the spring, as a crop that matures in late summer to early fall. There is a multitude of varieties, filling out the entire spectrum of color, size, and flavor. Anyway, it's important to remember that the numbers in this fall planting guide are only a starting point for you!

California, that time changes if planting that vegetable in northern California. The days are bright and warm enough, and if you're starting tomatoes from seed, you can get a jump-start on the season by planting earlier and harvesting earlier. These problems that plague tomatoes grown in containers can magnify in tropical or subtropical climates, where the humidity is turned up and pests multiply. If you are in Zone 10 (parts of Hawaii, southern California and southern Florida), you can plant tomatoes late as a fall crop. All of the following pertains to full-size tomatoes. Oregon's Rogue River Valley, California's High Foothills Growing season: May to early Oct. Summers are hot and dry; typical winter lows run from 23 degrees to 9 degrees F/-5 degrees to -13 degrees C. The summer-winter contrast suits plants that need dry, hot summers and moist, only moderately cold winters. In the U.S. we ripen them by putting them in a sunny east or west window. Tomatoes can be found in nearly every vegetable garden across the country, and with good reason, as little else compares to the flavor of a home-grown tomato. Remove tomato plant from the nursery pot (even if it is a peat pot). Until fairly recently, this favorite fruit was either imported from growers in Mexico or produced as greenhouse tomatoes in California or Arizona. Beans (Zones 3-10): There are two main kinds of beans found in gardens, bush beans and pole beans. The same tips and methods can be applied to late tomato planting in many hot-summer areas. One of the most helpful but often ignored tips in growing tomatoes is not to plant your tomatoes in the garden too early, waiting until all danger of frost has passed (usually in to May). When to Plant Tomatoes in Sacramento Valley. Most tomatoes, peppers and eggplants, for example, require around 100 days to harvest, therefore you'd want to transplant those into the ground around August 1. Transplants can be set into the ground beginning in about April, but tomatoes are warm weather plants, so planting when the weather is warmer is usually better. Suggested varieties: California Wonder, ... It's still not too late to plant tomatoes and peppers from seeds as well. The mycorrhizal fungi assist with water and nutrient absorption by the plant and reduce plant stress. Northern California and the north coast: Growing tomatoes in a greenhouse isn't for the faint of heart; they require specific greenhouse tomato plant care entirely different from other crops. ZONE 8.

For more information and to find your zone, you can check out the USDA Zone Hardiness Map here. Tomatoes are not hard to grow; they're incredibly productive, versatile in the kitchen, and so delicious off the vine. Southern California Growing Seasons. The Sacramento Valley of California has long, hot dry summers, making it a good environment for growing some varieties of tomatoes… Be sure to check your gardening zone for last frost dates. When to Plant Tomatoes in Zone 8b?. Our guide covers all the information you need to grow tomatoes successfully—including selecting tomato varieties, starting seeds, transplanting tomatoes outside, using tomato stakes and cages, and tomato plant care. Once the plant has reach about 18" (45cm) high it … The roots decompose in the soil and ultimately become nutrients for future vegetables. Only the really immature ones were lost that way. And that is saying a lot, because we certainly grow quite a few delicious heirloom tomato varieties. The Spruce / K. Dave Because containers can dry out quickly, achieving success growing tomatoes in containers depends on maintaining consistent moisture. Choose the varieties wisely. Cold air from the surrounding hills drains into our area and we are reliably cooler than much of the surrounding areas. Stringing Tomatoes – How to String Support Tomatoes. In fact, between our garden and container plantings, usually upwards of 20 or more different tomatoes. Tomato Planting Guide. Studies have shown that they can also increase crop yields, giving you more harvestable fruit. Gardening: The art of planting tomatoes Mar./Apr. 03 of 05. The adage that it is better to be safe than sorry applies here. Determinate tomato plants grow like a bush to a certain size (about 3 to 5 feet), set fruit, and then decline. Submitted by Dale on April 25, 2018 - 9:48am . Everyone plants tomatoes in Sacramento. Tomatoes are tender perennials grown as annuals, since they're hardy only in U.S. Department of Agriculture plant hardiness zones 10 through 11. Most garden centers carry these. Read more about planting dates for tomatoes. Cold-air Basins of California's Central Valley Growing season: mid … While the tomato is technically categorized as a fruit, it's also considered the most commonly grown "vegetable" in the country. This is anchored at the base of the plant and taken to a point usually on the greenhouse roof. I cut the summer plants off at the soil level rather than pulling them out (roots and all). The vines of indeterminate plants continue to grow until frost or disease kills them. Five Year Plan Contact Us State EFNEP Office ...
