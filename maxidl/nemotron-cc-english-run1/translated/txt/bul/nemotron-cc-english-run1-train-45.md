| Political Selling 101<br/><br/>Written by Dave Stein<br/><br/>Note: To see charts in this article, view it on  Most people who have been selling for even a short period of time understand that some level of corporate politics is present in every organization into which they sell. As sales professionals' experience and political savvy increases, so does what they observe in their accounts. If you aren't aware of political activity in your accounts, it doesn't mean that it isn't there. It just means you can't see it and certainly can't leverage it. If your competitor is politically savvy, you are at a distinct disadvantage. What is politics? According to Merriam-Webster one definition is, "competition between competing interest groups or individuals for power and leadership." Winners have developed a set of skills that enables them to consistently succeed because of, or in spite of, politics. They've learned to select right competing interest groups and then ride power and leadership wave to success by devising and executing political strategies for each key influencer and decision maker. Being adept politically will rarely lead to a win by itself. There are many other components to winning. But to not understand and take advantage of interpersonal forces within an account is to leave assets unleveraged. Here are some of key skills required to elevate yourself into realm of political selling: Skill: A basic understanding of how corporate politics works. For our purposes, politics and influence are synonymous. People need help of other people to achieve certain business goals (i.e. my department's project gets funded) as well as business-driven personal goals (i.e. if it is successful, I get a raise--I can afford that new house). Within a company, it works something like this: "If you report to me I can just tell you to do something and you will do it." That's SAY-SO influence. You'll do it because I say so. But if you don't work for me--let's say you work in another department--it becomes more difficult. I then have to influence you to help me. I'll use POLITICAL influence. That requires a combination of skills and artistry and it takes time and strategy. Here is an example: Let's say that we both work for same company, but for different departments. If I need your help for my department to achieve its quarterly objectives, I might look for ways in which I can help you achieve your objectives (ideally, business and personal objectives) and subtly advertise those to you as benefits of helping me. In that way we are aligned with a set of common interdependent purposes. Win-win. When you are selling into a company, you have absolutely no SAY-SO over buyer. You can't tell anyone in your customer's company what to do. You can only influence them to give you information, insights, coaching and preference so that they influence others to look at you and your offering favorably. The best way to influence someone is to clearly communicate how and by how much you will contribute to advancement of their business and (business-related) personal goals. In diagram below, you'll see that when you can help a buyer or influencer meet their personal and business goals (Quadrant 1), you're much more likely to gain commitment from them in helping you win. In Quadrant 2, there is no personal win, so their commitment, although altruistic so far as a contribution to their company, will not be supported as strongly. Stay away from people in Quadrant 3. In those cases, person you are selling to is "in it for themselves," acting counter to what is in best interests of their company. You run risk of not only losing deal, but being associated with "dirty politics," which could affect your personal and your company's reputation. Quadrant 4 reminds you that if you find you can't contribute to person achieving their business or personal goals, your likelihood of gaining their support is minimal. Don't turn these people into enemies, but focus your efforts on finding and selling to influencers in first quadrant. Skill: The ability to see what's invisible As I suggested earlier, not everyone is skilled enough to observe sophisticated corporate politicians being influential. Savvy politicians do their thing privately. It's not unlike backroom deals done by government politicians. How do you know that there is influence being wielded? First, assume it is. Then begin to look at results and work backward. We can extract a good example from everyday government politics: If there is "pork"--say $650.3 million in corporate tax benefits for igloo manufacturers in Alaska--embedded in a House of Representatives education bill, you can quickly figure out who lent a hand getting it through committee. Ask your contacts within your customer's company or government department about prior purchases, projects and initiatives. Find out who sponsored them, whose budgets paid for them, who were ultimate decision makers and who benefited in some more personal ways. The names you come up with will likely be people of influence, either through their command of an organization, or through astute politicking. They are ones for whose influence you will be positioning during your sales campaign. Skill: Connecting dots You've done some discovery and have begun to make associations. When you asked about recent projects, several people referenced Carrie Miehome, who works in IT organization. She deftly led steering committee with CRM project last year. Funny thing though, that project was put ahead of others that already had funding. Why would that be, you might ask? Who benefits from a CRM implementation? The VP of Sales? The VP of Customer Service? Perhaps CFO who wants more visibility into revenue stream... It's perfectly reasonable to expect that she was influenced by a higher power. The challenge will be finding out whom, what was in it for them and what was in it for her if you are selling IT solutions to that company. Skill: Knowing how to map out organization You'll need to start with an organization chart. If they won't give you one, you can build one by getting answers to pointed questions about reporting structure, by reading information on web and, if your customer is a public company, from corporate SEC filings.<br/><br/>Why Write a Sales Letter for Each Product?<br/><br/>Authors/publishers are great at getting their books written. Entrepreneurs know their products. But after initial one-year honeymoon, sales slow down. To counter this make sure your ebook, product, or service you offer will keep on selling from first day, first year, even for life. Write a short sales letter for each product or ebook.<br/><br/>Whether you have a Web site or not, you can write a first class, must-buy-now sales letter. Write one for each teleclass, eBook, product, or service. I even write one for my bookcoaching services.<br/><br/>If you are like me and have a Web site, it is content driven. Why? Because that's why people come to any site--to get free information. You must also give them a reason to buy. Most home pages say too much about author or book instead of intriguing their potential buyers with a benefit- driven headline, which in turns leads them to benefits of their books--the sales letter.<br/><br/>My first Web site had many fine books and kits in personal growth and book writing and marketing. Sales never went over $200 a month. To correct that, I created a new site and paid special attention to its sales language (without hype) for each teleclass, eBook, and book coaching opportunities to suit each income and need. Sales were $75 first month, and in four months they reached $2265. The next year they went around $3000 a month.<br/><br/>What Every Sales Letter Needs to Pull Orders and Profits<br/><br/>You can write each sales letter in less than four hours first time. As you practice, you can write them in two hours.<br/><br/>1. Start Letter with a Benefit-Driven Headline.<br/><br/>Include these headlines throughout your sales letter. "Want a quick and easy way to quadruple your Online Income in Four Months?<br/><br/>If you answered, "yes" to yourself, headline succeeds, because you will keep reading. If you said "No, I don't believe this, " but I'm curious where this is going," headline still succeeds. You win when your headline seduces your potential customer to read on in your sales letter to discover your product[']s benefits and features, some fine testimonials, and finally to click "buy now" which takes them to order page.<br/><br/>2. List Top Five Benefits of your Product or Service in bullet form.<br/><br/>To define your top benefits start with a list of problems your client or customer wants solutions for. Each specific problem you answer can be labeled a benefit. If you are not rock sure of who your audience is, your sales copy dribbles away and doesn't meet its target. Keep redefining your audience and know as much about them as you can.<br/><br/>Remember that one benefit is top undeniable benefit—usually more money easier, more clients faster, more profits from Web sales, better relationships, and health.<br/><br/>If you have more than five benefits collected in a list, sprinkle rest throughout your copy. How will your book make someone's life easier, richer in time or money, help their personal growth, provide additional income, entertain them? How will your product or service make them a better business person, more attractive, feel better, avoid catastrophe, sickness, or surgery?<br/><br/>3. Address your Potential Buyer's Resistances.<br/><br/>Remember to tell a background story of where they are NOW so they will emotionally connect with your solutions (the product or service). Let's say they want to write an eBook or print book to make themselves "expert," make life-long passive income, or share their unique message. | Политически продажби 101<br/><br/>Написано от Dave Stein<br/><br/>Забележка: За да видите диаграмите в тази статия, вижте я на Повечето хора, които са продавали дори за кратък период от време, разбират, че във всяка организация, в която продават, присъства някакво ниво на корпоративна политика. Тъй като опитът на професионалистите по продажбите и политическите умения се увеличават, същото се случва и с това, което те наблюдават в своите сметки. Ако не сте наясно с политическата активност в сметките си, това не означава, че тя не е там. Това просто означава, че не можете да го видите и със сигурност не можете да го използвате. Ако вашият конкурент е политически грамотен, вие сте в ясно изразено неизгодно положение. Какво е политиката? Според Merriam-Webster една дефиниция е "конкуренция между конкуриращи се групи по интереси или индивиди за власт и лидерство." Победителите са развили набор от умения, които им позволяват последователно да успяват поради или въпреки политиката. Те са се научили да избират правилните конкурентни групи по интереси и след това да се возят на власт и лидерска вълна към успеха, като разработват и изпълняват политически стратегии за всеки ключов инфлуенсър и вземащ решения. Да бъдеш адепт политически рядко води до победа сам по себе си. Има много други компоненти за победа. Но да не разбираш и да се възползваш от междуличностните сили в рамките на една сметка е да оставиш активите незаети. Ето някои от ключовите умения, необходими, за да се издигнете в сферата на политическите продажби: Умения: Основно разбиране за това как работи корпоративната политика. За нашите цели политиката и влиянието са синоними. Хората се нуждаят от помощта на други хора, за да постигнат определени бизнес цели (т.е. проектът на моя отдел се финансира), както и бизнес-ориентирани лични цели (т.е. ако е успешен, получавам повишение - мога да си позволя тази нова къща). В рамките на една компания работи нещо такова: "Ако ми докладвате, мога просто да ви кажа да направите нещо и ще го направите." Това е SAY-SO влияние. Ще го направите, защото аз казвам така. Но ако не работите за мен - да кажем, че работите в друг отдел - става по-трудно. След това трябва да ви влияя, за да ми помогнете. Ще използвам ПОЛИТИЧЕСКО влияние. Това изисква комбинация от умения и артистичност и отнема време и стратегия. Ето един пример: Да кажем, че и двамата работим за една и съща компания, но за различни отдели. Ако имам нужда от вашата помощ за моя отдел, за да постигне своите тримесечни цели, може да се търсят начини, по които мога да ви помогне да постигнете целите си (в идеалния случай, бизнес и лични цели) и фино да рекламират тези за вас като ползи от помощта ми. По този начин ние сме подравнени с набор от общи взаимозависими цели. Печеливш. Когато продавате в компания, нямате абсолютно никакво SAY-SO над купувача. Не можете да кажете на никого в компанията на клиента си какво да прави. Можете само да им повлияете, за да ви дадат информация, прозрения, треньорство и предпочитания, така че те да повлияят на другите да гледат на вас и вашето предлагане благоприятно. Най-добрият начин да повлияете на някого е да комуникирате ясно как и с колко ще допринесете за напредъка на неговия бизнес и (свързани с бизнеса) лични цели. На диаграмата по-долу ще видите, че когато можете да помогнете на купувач или инфлуенсър да изпълни своите лични и бизнес цели (Quadrant 1), е много по-вероятно да спечелите ангажимент от тях, като ви помогне да спечелите. В квадрант 2 няма лична победа, така че техният ангажимент, макар и алтруистичен, доколкото е принос към тяхната компания, няма да бъде подкрепен толкова силно. Стойте далеч от хората в квадрант 3. В тези случаи лицето, на което продавате, е "в него за себе си", действайки в противоречие с това, което е в най-добрия интерес на тяхната компания. Рискувате не само да загубите сделка, но и да бъдете свързани с "мръсна политика", която може да засегне вашата лична и репутацията на вашата компания. Квадрант 4 ви напомня, че ако откриете, че не можете да допринесете за постигането на техните бизнес или лични цели, вероятността да спечелите подкрепата им е минимална. Не превръщайте тези хора във врагове, а съсредоточете усилията си върху намирането и продажбата на инфлуенсъри в първи квадрант. Умение: Способността да се вижда това, което е невидимо Както предложих по-рано, не всеки е достатъчно квалифициран, за да наблюдава как сложните корпоративни политици са влиятелни. Не е по-различно от задкулисни сделки, направени от правителствени политици. Откъде знаете, че се упражнява влияние? Първо, да предположим, че е така. След това започнете да гледате на резултатите и да работите назад. Можем да извлечем добър пример от ежедневната правителствена политика: Ако има "свинарник" - да кажем $650.3 милиона в корпоративни данъчни облекчения за производителите на иглу в Аляска - вграден в законопроект за образование на Камарата на представителите, можете бързо да разберете кой е дал ръка, за да го получи чрез комисия. Попитайте вашите контакти в рамките на компанията или правителствения отдел на вашия клиент за предварителни покупки, проекти и инициативи. Разберете кой ги е спонсорирал, чиито бюджети са плащали за тях, кои са вземали крайни решения и кои са се възползвали по някои по-лични начини. Имената, които измисляте, вероятно ще бъдат хора с влияние, или чрез тяхното командване на организация, или чрез проницателно политизиране. Те са такива, за чието влияние ще се позиционирате по време на вашата кампания за продажби. Умение: Свързване на точки Вие сте направили някои открития и сте започнали да правите асоциации. Когато попитахте за последните проекти, няколко души се позоваха на Кери Мийхоум, която работи в ИТ организация. Тя умело ръководеше управителния комитет с CRM проект миналата година. Смешното е, че този проект беше поставен пред други, които вече имаха финансиране. Защо това да е, може да попитате? Кой печели от внедряването на CRM? Вицето на продажбите? Може би финансов директор, който иска повече видимост в потока от приходи... е напълно разумно да се очаква, че тя е била повлияна от по-висша сила. Предизвикателството ще бъде да разберете кой, какво е било в него за тях и какво е било в него за нея, ако продавате ИТ решения на тази компания. Умение: Знаейки как да набележите организация Ще трябва да започнете с организационна диаграма. Ако не ви дадат такъв, можете да го изградите, като получите отговори на конкретни въпроси за структурата на отчитане, като прочетете информация в мрежата и, ако клиентът ви е публична компания, от корпоративните SEC документи.<br/><br/>Защо да напишете писмо за продажба за всеки продукт?<br/><br/>Авторите/издателите са страхотни в писането на книгите си. Предприемачите познават продуктите си. Но след първоначалния едногодишен меден месец продажбите се забавят. За да се противопоставите на това, уверете се, че вашата електронна книга, продукт или услуга, която предлагате, ще продължи да се продава от първия ден, първата година, дори за цял живот. Напишете кратко писмо за продажби за всеки продукт или електронна книга.<br/><br/>Независимо дали имате уеб сайт или не, можете да напишете първокласно, трябва-купи-сега писмо за продажба. Напишете по едно за всеки телеклас, електронна книга, продукт или услуга. Дори пиша едно за моите услуги за книгообмен.<br/><br/>Ако сте като мен и имате уеб сайт, той се задвижва от съдържание. Защо? Защото затова хората идват на всеки сайт - за да получат безплатна информация. Трябва също така да им дадете причина да купуват. Повечето начални страници казват твърде много за автор или книга, вместо да заинтригуват потенциалните си купувачи с полезно заглавие, което от своя страна ги води до ползите от техните книги - писмото за продажба.<br/><br/>Първият ми уеб сайт имаше много фини книги и комплекти за личностно израстване и писане на книги и маркетинг. Продажбите никога не надхвърлят 200 долара на месец. За да коригирам това, създадох нов сайт и обърнах специално внимание на езика му за продажби (без hype) за всяка телекласа, електронна книга и възможности за коучинг на книги, които да отговарят на всеки доход и нужда. Продажбите бяха $ 75 първия месец, а за четири месеца те достигнаха $ 2265. На следващата година те отидоха около 3000 долара на месец.<br/><br/>Какво всяко търговско писмо трябва да тегли поръчки и печалби<br/><br/>Можете да напишете всяко писмо за продажби за по-малко от четири часа първи път. Докато практикувате, можете да ги напишете за два часа.<br/><br/>1. Започнете писмо с заглавие, насочено към ползите.<br/><br/>Включете тези заглавия в цялото си писмо за продажби. "Искате ли бърз и лесен начин да учетворите онлайн доходите си за четири месеца?<br/><br/>Ако сте отговорили с "да" на себе си, заглавието успява, защото ще продължите да четете. Ако сте казали "Не, не вярвам на това", но съм любопитен накъде отива това, заглавието все пак успява. Печелите, когато заглавието ви съблазнява потенциалния ви клиент да прочете в писмото ви за продажби, за да открие ползите и функциите на вашия продукт, някои фини препоръки и накрая да кликнете върху "купи сега", което ги отвежда до страницата за поръчка.<br/><br/>2. списък Топ пет ползи от вашия продукт или услуга в куршум форма.<br/><br/>За да определите най-добрите си ползи, започнете със списък с проблеми, за които вашият клиент или клиент иска решения. Всеки конкретен проблем, на който отговаряте, може да бъде етикетиран като полза. Ако не сте сигурни коя е вашата аудитория, вашето копие на продажбите се дриблира и не отговаря на целта си. Продължавайте да предефинирате аудиторията си и да знаете колкото се може повече за тях.<br/><br/>Не забравяйте, че една полза е най-добрата неоспорима полза – обикновено повече пари по-лесно, повече клиенти по-бързо, повече печалби от уеб продажби, по-добри взаимоотношения и здраве.<br/><br/>Ако имате повече от пет ползи, събрани в списък, поръсете почивка в цялото си копие. Как книгата ви ще направи нечий живот по-лесен, по-богат на време или пари, ще помогне на личното им израстване, ще осигури допълнителен доход, ще ги забавлява? Как вашият продукт или услуга ще ги направи по-добър бизнесмен, по-привлекателен, ще се почувства по-добре, ще избегне катастрофа, болест или операция?<br/><br/>3. адресиране на потенциалните съпротиви на купувача.<br/><br/>Не забравяйте да разкажете история за това къде са сега, така че те да се свържат емоционално с вашите решения (продукт или услуга). Да кажем, че искат да напишат електронна книга или да отпечатат книга, за да станат "експерти", да правят пасивни доходи през целия живот или да споделят уникалното си послание. |

Salt is a preservative but it is also something that adds savor and enjoyment to our daily food. Light is a symbol of truth; it is comforting, penetrating, guiding and exposes darkness. We seek to preserve biblical truth and shed the glorious light of the Gospel in a world that is consumed by darkness.<br/><br/>Watch the webcast eaec.org/webcast.htm<br/><br/>ABOUT THE VIDEO<br/><br/>God has given progressive revelations throughout the Bible and it is with this knowledge that we can deduce there was a creation prior to Adam. We don't know how long it lasted but Lucifer was an angel who led a rebellion in heaven and started a war that affected the entire universe. The earth was his planet and he ruled from Eden, the same place where God would later put Adam and Eve. As Lucifer's last stand, the earth would have been damaged and looked much like Berlin did at the end of World War II. This would explain why the Bible speaks about a re-creation and God's call to replenish the earth. Adam and Eve were thrown into the conflict to prove that God is righteous to the angelic world. The rewards are potentially enormous: eternal life and being joint heirs with Jesus Christ.<br/><br/>If there was indeed a pre-Adamic civilization with commerce and war, then you shouldn't be surprised when a new world order emerges in the future that calls for peace and offers membership to anyone who will take an oath of loyalty and receive an identification mark that will give you access to the new financial system.

Ние сме библейски центрирана група от вярващи, които желаят да растат в пълното познание на Исус Христос без компромис с Неговото Слово. Ние вярваме, учим и практикуваме всички неща, които Исус учи и са били практикувани от Църквата в книгата на Деянията на апостолите. Исус призова учениците си да бъдат сол и светлина. Солта е консервант, но също така е нещо, което добавя вкус и наслада към ежедневната ни храна. Светлината е символ на истината; тя е успокояваща, проникваща, насочваща и излагаща тъмнината. Ние се стремим да запазим библейската истина и да хвърлим славната светлина на Евангелието в един свят, който е погълнат от тъмнината.<br/><br/>Гледайте уебкаст eaec.org/webcast.htm<br/><br/>ЗА ВИДЕОТО<br/><br/>Бог е дал прогресивни откровения в цялата Библия и именно с това знание можем да заключим, че е имало творение преди Адам. Не знаем колко време е продължило, но Луцифер бил ангел, който повел бунт в небето и започнал война, която засегнала цялата вселена. Земята била неговата планета и той управлявал от Едем, същото място, където по-късно Бог щял да постави Адам и Ева. Като последна позиция на Луцифер, земята би била повредена и би изглеждала подобно на Берлин в края на Втората световна война. Това би обяснило защо Библията говори за пресъздаване и Божия призив за попълване на земята. Адам и Ева бяха хвърлени в конфликта, за да докажат, че Бог е праведен към ангелския свят. Възнаграждението е потенциално огромно: вечен живот и съвместни наследници с Исус Христос.<br/><br/>Ако наистина е имало пред-адамова цивилизация с търговия и война, тогава не трябва да се изненадвате, когато в бъдеще се появи нов световен ред, който призовава за мир и предлага членство на всеки, който ще положи клетва за лоялност и ще получи идентификационен знак, който ще ви даде достъп до новата финансова система.

| Post oak leaves have distinctive cross shape<br/><br/>So said the eminent Harvard botanist Asa Gray, on page 451 in his encyclopedic "Lessons in Botany and Vegetable Physiology," a book published in 1872.<br/><br/>I got my copy at an old bookstore several years ago. I can't remember where exactly. The book is some 700 pages long, not including a series of gorgeous line drawings of sedges, grasses and ferns in the back. The pages feature fore edge marbling…a bit faded now… and the front and back covers are ornamented, with the monogram of the publishing house. They don't make books like this anymore.<br/><br/>Professor Gray was, of course, referring to what we have as this week's Mystery Plant, the post oak, Quercus stellata. I'm pretty confident that all you botanists out there will recognize this instantly as some sort of oak.<br/><br/>Post oak leaves are bright green, and scratchy on the surfaces.(Photo: Keith Bradley)<br/><br/>Oaks belong to the genus Quercus…and they are not always large trees. Some species, of course, are called "scrub oaks", which seems to me a bit of a botanical "put-down", and other species are good examples of shrubs, not more than about knee-high.<br/><br/>Here in the Southeast, we have about 45 native oak species, most of which can rather easily be differentiated into two groups: "White oaks" (including our Mystery Plant) have rounded lobes, without any points or bristles on the tips.<br/><br/>"Red oaks" feature sharply pointed lobes, each with a prominent bristle at the top. There are some other differences, too.<br/><br/>Post oak is widely distributed in the eastern USA, from southern New England through Missouri and Texas, and then east from there, including northern Florida. It is a deciduous species, producing pale, somewhat shreddy or scaly bark. Really large, old individuals can be over 60 feet tall, and because of this, they make great shade trees along city streets and in parks.<br/><br/>The acorns take one season to mature, and they are a valuable wildlife food source. What most people remember about this species are the leaves. The leaves are bright green, and scratchy on the surfaces. Generally, the leaves have a distinctive cross-shaped ("cruciform") look, with two major lobes projected more or less horizontally from the midrib.<br/><br/>The cross-shape is not always well-developed from individual to individual, however, especially is there has been any hybridization going on. (Oak species are famous for mixing it up with each other.)<br/><br/>And this is interesting: Professor Gray refers to this oak in his book by using an incorrect name. The correct and first valid name came about in 1787, penned by a German botanist named Friedrich von Wangenheim. But for some reason, Gray printed the name Quercus obtusiloba, which had been proposed by the French botanist, Andre Michaux. But Michaux was 15 years late — je regrette.<br/><br/>John Nelson is the curator of the A. C.

Не мога да си спомня къде точно. Книгата е дълга около 700 страници, без да включва поредица от великолепни рисунки на остриета, треви и папрати отзад. Страниците са с преден ръб, малко избледнели сега, а предните и задните корици са орнаментирани, с монограмата на издателството.<br/><br/>Професор Грей, разбира се, имаше предвид това, което имаме като Мистерийното растение от тази седмица, пост дъба, Quercus stellata. Аз съм доста уверен, че всички вие ботаници там ще разпознаете това веднага като някакъв дъб.<br/><br/>Пост дъбови листа са ярко зелени, и надраскване по повърхностите. (Снимка: Кийт Брадли)<br/><br/>Дъбовете принадлежат към рода Quercus... и не винаги са големи дървета. Някои видове, разбира се, се наричат "скръбни дъбове", което ми се струва малко ботаническо "сваляне", а други видове са добри примери за храсти, не повече от високи до колене.<br/><br/>Тук на югоизток имаме около 45 местни вида дъб, повечето от които могат доста лесно да бъдат диференцирани в две групи: "Белите дъбове" (включително нашето Мистериозно растение) имат заоблени лобове, без никакви точки или четина по върховете.<br/><br/>"Червените дъбове" се отличават с остро заострени лобове, всеки с подчертана четина на върха. Има и някои други разлики.<br/><br/>Пост дъбът е широко разпространен в източната част на САЩ, от южна Нова Англия през Мисури и Тексас, а след това на изток от там, включително Северна Флорида. Той е широколистен вид, произвеждащ бледа, донякъде настъргана или лющеща се кора. Наистина големи, стари индивиди могат да бъдат високи над 60 фута, и поради това, те правят големи сенчести дървета по градските улици и в парковете.<br/><br/>Жълъдите се нуждаят от един сезон, за да узреят и са ценен източник на храна за дивите животни. Това, което повечето хора помнят за този вид, са листата. Листата са ярко зелени и надраскани по повърхностите. Като цяло, листата имат отличителен кръстообразен („круциформен") вид, с два големи лоба, прожектирани повече или по-малко хоризонтално от средата.<br/><br/>Кръстосаната форма не винаги е добре развита от индивид към индивид, обаче, особено е имало някаква хибридизация става. (Oak видове са известни с смесването му един с друг.)<br/><br/>И това е интересно: професор Грей се позовава на този дъб в книгата си, като използва неправилно име. Правилното и първото валидно име идва през 1787 г., написано от немски ботаник на име Фридрих фон Вангенхайм. Но по някаква причина Грей отпечатва името Quercus obtusiloba, което е предложено от френския ботаник Андре Мишо.<br/><br/>Джон Нелсън е куратор на A.C.
