Undocumented migrants have nothing. They are not allowed to work. They have no right to state benefits nor to a place to live. They are unseen and potentially the most vulnerable group in the UK today.<br/><br/>Undocumented (or irregular) migrants include those trafficked into the sex trade or for domestic servitude; they include visa overstayers; those whose asylum applications have been refused and others who have been subject to failures in the immigration system. All of these may originally have come to the UK legally.<br/><br/>'Illegal immigrants' – those imagined to have entered the country in the backs of lorries – make up a small proportion of the undocumented.<br/><br/>Indeed some sources suggest that half the estimated 120,000 undocumented children in the UK were actually born here to undocumented parents. These children are disadvantaged from birth, solely by their immigration status.<br/><br/>The blog tells the stories of the undocumented. It highlights their daily struggles and vulnerabilities, but also their strength and resilience. It's not an easy read.<br/><br/>You can access the blog via our website (bottom of right hand column on Home Page).<br/><br/>The blog has won the online category of the Speaking Together media awards. The awards were a new addition this year to the Migrant and Refugee Woman of the Year Awards celebration at the Royal Festival Hall in London as part of International Women's Day. The panel of judges – including novelist and playwright Gillian Slovo, and journalist and author, Hannah Pool – was particularly looking for work that challenged myths and stereotypes.<br/><br/>The blog has also won the Blog North Awards 2013 in the Best Writing category and was also shortlisted for an Amnesty International Media Award. | Навигация<br/><br/>"Живот без документи" печели награда за най-добро писане<br/><br/>Проектът за блог, "Живот без документи", създаден от Лен Грант, представя истории на недокументирани семейства на мигранти и млади хора. Недокументираните мигранти нямат нищо. Те нямат право да работят. Те нямат право на държавни помощи, нито на място за живеене. Те са невидима и потенциално най-уязвимата група в Обединеното кралство днес.<br/><br/>Недокументираните (или нередовните) мигранти включват тези, които са били обект на трафик в търговията със секс или за домашно робство; те включват лица, които са превишили визовия режим; тези, чиито молби за убежище са били отказани и други, които са били обект на неуспехи в имиграционната система. Всички те може първоначално да са дошли в Обединеното кралство законно.<br/><br/>"Нелегалните имигранти" - тези, за които се предполага, че са влезли в страната в гърбовете на камионите - съставляват малка част от недокументираните.<br/><br/>Всъщност някои източници предполагат, че половината от приблизително 120 000 деца без документи във Великобритания всъщност са родени тук от родители без документи. Тези деца са в неравностойно положение по рождение, единствено поради имиграционния си статут.<br/><br/>Блогът разказва историите на недокументираните. Той подчертава ежедневните им борби и уязвимости, но и тяхната сила и устойчивост. Не е лесно да се прочете.<br/><br/>Можете да получите достъп до блога чрез нашия уебсайт (долу в дясната колона на началната страница).<br/><br/>Блогът спечели онлайн категорията на медийните награди Speaking Together. Наградите бяха ново попълнение тази година към честването на наградите Жена на годината за мигранти и бежанци в Кралската фестивална зала в Лондон като част от Международния ден на жената. Журито от съдии – включително писателката и драматург Джилиан Слово и журналистката и авторка Хана Пул – е търсило особено работа, която оспорва митовете и стереотипите.<br/><br/>Блогът е носител и на наградите Blog North Awards 2013 в категорията за най-добро писане и също така е номиниран за награда на Amnesty International Media. |
| Sabbath School Lesson<br/><br/>In Galatians, Paul tackles issues such as freedom, the role of the law in salvation, our condition in Christ, and the nature of the Spirit-led life, as well as the age-old question, How can sinful humans be made right before a holy and just God?<br/><br/>Many scholars believe that Galatians may be the earliest of Paul's letters. It was written in A.D. 49, shortly after the famous Jerusalem Council (Acts 15). Therefore, the book may be the oldest Christian document known. As Acts and Galatians make clear, the early church found itself in a fierce battle over the nature of salvation, especially in the case of Gentiles. According to a group of Jewish believers, known as Judaizers, belief in Jesus alone was not good enough for Gentiles. Gentiles must also be circumcised and follow the laws of Moses (Acts 15:1).<br/><br/>This quarter's Bible study guide invites us to journey with the apostle Paul as he pleads with the Galatians to remain true to Jesus. It also gives us a chance to reflect on our own understanding of the truths that opened the way for Martin Luther's ultimate break with Rome and the restoration of the biblical gospel. | Урок от съботното училище<br/><br/>В Галатяни Павел разглежда въпроси като свободата, ролята на закона в спасението, нашето състояние в Христос и естеството на водения от Духа живот, както и вековния въпрос: Как грешните хора могат да бъдат направени прави пред свят и справедлив Бог?<br/><br/>Много учени смятат, че Галатяни може да е най-ранното от писмата на Павел. Тя е написана през 49 г. сл. Хр., малко след известния Йерусалимски събор (Деяния 15). Следователно, книгата може да е най-старият известен християнски документ. Както Деяния и Галатяни изясняват, ранната църква се оказала в ожесточена битка за природата на спасението, особено в случая на езичниците. Според група вярващи евреи, известни като юдаисти, вярата само в Исус не е била достатъчно добра за езичниците. Неевреите също трябва да бъдат обрязани и да следват законите на Мойсей (Деяния 15:1).<br/><br/>Ръководството за изучаване на Библията на тази четвърт ни кани да пътуваме с апостол Павел, докато той умолява галатяните да останат верни на Исус. Също така ни дава възможност да размишляваме върху собственото си разбиране на истините, които отвориха пътя за окончателното скъсване на Мартин Лутер с Рим и възстановяването на библейското евангелие. |

Толкова много поети и художници прекарват времето си там, че Хилдбургхаузен е наречен Клайн-Ваймар, когато последният херцог на Сакс-Гота-Алтенбург умира без проблем през 1825 г., другите клонове на къщата решават да пренаредят Ернестинските херцогства. На 12 ноември 1826 г. Фредерик става херцог на Сакско-Алтенбург, на който дава първи основен закон през 1831 г. в замяна на медии, свързани с Фредерик, херцог на Сакско-Алтенбург в Общомедия geneall. net<br/><br/>Фредерик, херцог на Сакско-Алтенбург<br/>–<br/>Фредерик<br/><br/>15.<br/>Херцогиня Шарлота Джорджина от Мекленбург-Щрелиц<br/>–<br/>Шарлот Джорджине е родена в Хановер, избирателен район Брънзуик-Люнебург.

Те също имат проблеми, Сакско-Хилдбургхаузен е финансово съсипан от пагубните политики на предшествениците на Фредерикс. Приемниците позволяват на херцога и херцогинята само намален граждански списък, бащата на Шарлот и двама братя често остават с Шарлот в Хилдбургхаузен. През 1787 г. тя се премества за постоянно в Хилдбургхаузен и става президент на кредитния комитет. През 1792 г. бабата на Шарлот и нейните сестри бягат преди напредващата френска армия от Дармщат в Хилдбургхаузен, а баба й забелязва съпруга на Шарлот. От всичките си задължения той изпълнява брачните си задължения с усърдие. Шарлот, която никога не е обичала този мъж, винаги е бременна, семейството прекарва няколко безгрижни седмици в Хилдбургхаузен. През 1793 г. бабата на Шарлот се връща от изгнание и пътува със сестрите Шарлот във Франкфурт на Майн, Шарлот има много интимна и любяща връзка със сестра си Фридерике и роднини в Стрелиц. През 1803 и 1805 г. пруската кралска двойка посещава Хилдбургхаузен, като за този случай приемниците позволяват на херцогската двойка да поднови част от мебелите си. Луиз помага за съставянето на декларацията за война, Кристиан Трухсеш фон Ветцхаузен цу Бетенбург е приятел на херцогската двойка и кръстник на сина на Шарлот, Едуард. Много зрители са дошли да видят баварската принцеса, когато посреща гостите си, Трухсее се опитва да заведе по-нископоставената Шарлота първо в замъка си, но тя отказва, като се позовава на дъщеря си. Трухсее отговорил, Ваше Височество ще ми прости, но докато този замък е стоял тук, Терез грабнала бароните с другата ръка и тримата заедно минали през портата.

Баща му, бъдещият земевладелец, напуска семейството през 1747 г., през 1755 г. той официално прекратява брака с Мери. Дядото, Уилям VIII, ландграф на Хес, предоставя на графство Ханау и неговите приходи на Мери, младият принц Чарлз и двамата му братя, Уилям и Фредерик, са отгледани от майка им и отгледани от протестантски роднини от 1747 г.

Хесенските принцове по-късно остават в Дания, ставайки нейни важни господари, само най-големият брат Уилям се завръща в Хесен през 1785 г., след като се възкачва на ландграфството.

През 1763 г. по-големият му брат Уилям се жени за първия им братовчед, Чарлз последва примера на 30 август 1766 г. в двореца Кристиансборг – съпругата му е Луиза Датска, а Шарл става по този начин зет на братовчед си, крал Кристиан VII. Бракът се състои въпреки съветите, дадени срещу него, поради обвинения в разврат от страна на принц Чарлз. Скоро след това Чарлз изпада в немилост в двора и в началото на 1767 г. той и те ще имат първото си дете, Мари Софи, там през 1767 г., а след това и второто си дете, Уилям, през 1769 г. През 1768 г. Карл закупува имота и селото Офенбах-Румпенхайм от семейство Еделсхайм. През 1771 г. той разширява имението в замък и княжеско седалище и майка му Мария живее в двореца до смъртта си през 1772 г.

Шарл е назначен за главнокомандващ на норвежката армия и той и Луиз се преместват в Кристиана.

Хю е обявен за граф, но не може да надделее срещу Робърт, херцогът на Нормандия, в Разузнавателния спор между Хенри IV, император на Свещената Римска империя, и папа Григорий VII, Азо се опитва да посредничи, но по-късно той се присъединява на страната на папата.

Той е първият член на клона на Велф на Дом Есте, в родословието на Старейшината на Велф той се брои за Велф IV. Велф е син на Азо II от Есте и съпругата му Кунигунде от Алтдорф, когато чичо му по майчина линия, Велф, херцог на Каринтия, умира бездетен, Велф наследява неговата собственост. Велф се жени за Етелинда Нортеймска, дъщеря на Ото II, херцог на Бавария, когато неговият тъст, херцог Ото, става враг на крал Хенри IV и губи херцогството си, Велф остава верен на краля. В съответствие с командите на Хенрис, той се отказва и се развежда с херцогинята си Етелинде и това събитие се случва в Гослар през 1070 г., когато провинциите Бавария се предават тихо на новоизлюпения херцог, който е представител на едно от най-древните семейства в провинцията. Отхвърлянето му на херцогинята, което би могло да се счита за акт на несправедливост. Папата и императорът са повърхностно помирени през 1076 г., но годината ги вижда отново ангажирани в активни военни действия. Хенри, вследствие на многократни актове на бунт, обявява Уелф за детрониран в своето новопридобито херцогство. Въпреки това, подкрепен от верните си баварци и подпомогнат от баща си в Италия, Велф успява да запази мястото си, но Григорий умира през 1085 г. и наследниците му вземат по-малко интензивно участие в делата на Германия.

През 1089 г. синът му Велф се жени за Матилда от Тоскана, като по този начин укрепва отношенията си с папата, но след като по-младият Велф се развежда с Матилда през 1095 г., Велф се реваншира с крал Хенри IV и е препотвърден в позицията си на херцог на Бавария. След смъртта на баща си Азо през 1097 г., Велф се опитва да придобие бащината си собственост южно от Алпите, през 1099 г., Велф се присъединява към това, което ще стане известно като Кръстоносния поход от 1101 г., заедно с Уилям IX от Аквитания, Хю от Вермандоа и Ида от Австрия. Основният му успех е да предотврати сблъсък между свои събратя кръстоносци, които плячкосват византийска територия на път за Константинопол, самият Велф избягва фиаското, но умира на връщане в Пафос, Кипър, през 1101 г. и е погребан в абатство Вайнгартен.

Той се стреми да наследи тъста си като саксонски херцог, когато Магнус умира без наследници през 1106 г. Въпреки това херцог Хенри поддържа близки отношения с управляващата династия Салиан, през 1116 г. той се присъединява към втората италианска кампания на император Хенри V, за да завземе владенията на покойния маркиз Матилда от Тоскана. Той наследява по-големия си брат Уелф II като баварски херцог, когато последният умира бездетен през 1120 г., Хенри също така изиграва важна роля за постигането на Конкордат от Вормс от 1122 г., слагайки край на продължителните спорове за разследване между папата и императора. Бракът е сключен през май 1127 г., като отчуждаването между династиите Уелф и Хоенщауфен продължава до 13 век. След като Лотаир печели изборите, той налага имперска забрана на Фридрих II.

Here's What Your Body Is Trying to Tell You<br/><br/>by<br/>Byrdie<br/><br/>PHOTO:<br/><br/>Jacquemus<br/><br/>Weight gain from out-of-control cravings aside, it can be frustrating to have a constant hankering for something unhealthy and not know why. The good news is that there's usually a reason underlying that burning desire to house a bag of potato chips, or the feeling that you might actually die if you don't get a pickle rightthisinstant (even though you're not pregnant). If you're having visions of Milky Way bars, for example, it could mean that you're missing a very specific nutrient in your diet. (Yup—it's more complicated than said chocolate bar being so darn delicious.)<br/><br/>We talked to Los Angeles–based dietitian Shira Lenchewski, M.S., R.D., to get the skinny on some common food cravings, as well as what you can do to satiate the hunger without going overboard. Keep scrolling for some seriously good information!<br/><br/>If you're craving chocolate<br/><br/>It means: You could be lacking magnesium in your diet, says Lenchewski. "Magnesium is an essential mineral involved in energy production, glucose metabolism, and muscle function. This is especially true for those hitting the gym hard," she explains. Additionally, magnesium levels lower during the pre-menstrual weeks of your period, which explains why PMS so often comes with chocolate cravings.<br/><br/>Instead, reach for high-quality, low-sugar dark chocolate, which is naturally high in magnesium. "I recommend sticking to 75 per cent cocoa or higher, and pairing it with another magnesium-rich source like sunflower seeds," says Lenchewski. She suggests the chocolate brand Hu, a small-batch food company that focuses on high-quality ingredients produced locally. "It's a little pricey, but all the more reason to keep portions in check," she says. "It's my personal favourite." We're also big fans of superfood-packed Zenbunni.<br/><br/>If you're craving candy<br/><br/>It means: "Craving pure sugar is a good indication that you're running low on energy," says Lenchewski. "Think about it. What is the one thing you're itching for after a terrible night's sleep or at around 4 p.m. during a stressful workday? The answer is usually sugar because it's used as instant fuel for our body's cells."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for apples with nut butter. "If you're raiding your co-workers' candy stash, I recommend a more slow-burn carbohydrate with a source of fat or protein," says Lenchewski. "Unlike simple sugar, this will fuel your cells while avoiding the post-sugar crash. Two options that make for great pick-me-ups the next time you're craving candy: a sliced apple with your choice of nut butter, or berries with 2% unsweetened Greek yoghurt." We like quashing a sweet tooth with these addictive coconut chips, too—they're filling, free of any added sugar, and just so good.<br/><br/>If you're craving salt<br/><br/>It means: "If nothing but the saltiest pickle will do, you may not be drinking enough H2O," says Lenchewski. "Salt helps the body hold on to water, so we crave it when we're in need of fluids."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for water. "Stay hydrated, especially as we approach the summer months," she says. The next time a craving hits, try quenching it (literally) with a few refreshing glasses and you might find the urgency to sodium binge disappears. "If plain water bores you, try adding in mint, lemon, or frozen fruit to mix it up," says Lenchewski. And if that still doesn't do the trick, there's a healthier alternative to bagged chips or fries. "If you're really just craving salt after all, toasted seaweed is a great low-calorie option," she says.<br/><br/>If you're craving starchy carbs like pasta<br/><br/>It means: "Because high-carb foods boost the feel-good hormone serotonin, starch cravings can be a sign you're in need of a mood booster," says Lenchewski.<br/><br/>Instead, reach for a bath! "Bust out the Epsom salts, because it's time for some serious R+R," says Lenchewski. "Trust me. Indulging in a starch free-for-all feels really good in the moment, but it will likely bum you out more the next day." (As anyone who has ever over-indulged a pizza or pasta craving knows.) So the next time you want to dive head first into a bowl of carbs, draw a bath, light a candle, and treat yourself without any regret or dense calories.<br/><br/>If you're craving ice cream<br/><br/>5 / 6<br/><br/>It means: "Your body may be telling you it's in need of some healthy fat."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for coconut ice cream. "I'm a realist, so if you're craving ice cream, I'm not going to recommend a handful of walnuts, which are, of course, full of healthy fat," says Lenchewski. "For ice cream emergencies, I recommend lower-in-sugar coconut ice-creams like Coconut Bliss or Kippy's three-ingredient ice cream in Los Angeles." We can vouch for the fact that coconut ice cream tastes incredible and just like the real thing.<br/><br/>If you're craving a burger<br/><br/>It means: You need iron. "If you can't stop thinking about red meat, there's a chance your body is craving iron, b12 and folic acid," says Lenchewski. "This is especially true during or around that time of the month."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for a healthier burger. "I'm a proponent of grass fed, antibiotic and hormone-free red meat once a week," says Lenchewski. "Try experimenting with an open-faced bison burger—which, cut for cut, is leaner and has more iron than beef." Don't eat meat? Try to incorporate some kind of plant-based iron supplement into your routine, like spirulina. | Последвайте ни<br/><br/>Вие сте<br/><br/>ИНЗИДЕР<br/><br/>Ето какво се опитва да ви каже тялото ви<br/><br/>от<br/>Бърди<br/><br/>СНИМКА:<br/><br/>Жакмъс<br/><br/>Наддаване на тегло от извън контрол глад настрана, тя може да бъде разочароващо да има постоянен копнеж за нещо нездравословно и не знам защо. Добрата новина е, че обикновено има причина, която стои в основата на това изгарящо желание да се приюти торба с картофен чипс, или чувството, че всъщност може да умрете, ако не получите туршия точно това моментално (въпреки че не сте бременна). Ако например имате видения за баровете на Млечния път, това може да означава, че пропускате много специфично хранително вещество в диетата си. (Да, това е по-сложно от това, че шоколадът е толкова вкусен.)<br/><br/>Говорихме с диетолога от Лос Анджелис Шира Ленчевски, MS, R.D., за да получим кльощавата на някои общи хранителни гладове, както и това, което можете да направите, за да заситите глада, без да прекалявате. Продължавайте да превъртате за някаква сериозно добра информация!<br/><br/>Ако си жаден за шоколад<br/><br/>Това означава: Може да ви липсва магнезий в диетата ви, казва Ленчевски. "Магнезият е основен минерал, участващ в производството на енергия, метаболизма на глюкозата и мускулната функция. Това е особено вярно за тези, които удрят фитнеса трудно", обяснява тя. Освен това, нивата на магнезий са по-ниски по време на предменструалните седмици на вашия период, което обяснява защо ПМС толкова често идва с шоколадов глад.<br/><br/>Вместо това, посегнете към висококачествен тъмен шоколад с ниско съдържание на захар, който естествено е с високо съдържание на магнезий. "Препоръчвам да се придържате към 75% какао или по-високо и да го сдвоите с друг богат на магнезий източник като слънчогледовите семена", казва Ленчевски. Тя предлага шоколадовата марка Hu, малка компания за хранителни продукти, която се фокусира върху висококачествени съставки, произведени на местно ниво. "Това е малко скъпо, но още повече причина да държа порциите под контрол", казва тя. "Това е моята лична любима." Ние също сме големи фенове на суперхраните Zenbunni.<br/><br/>Ако си жаден за бонбони<br/><br/>Това означава: "Извличането на чиста захар е добра индикация, че ви свършва енергията", казва Ленчевски. "Помислете за това. Какво е единственото нещо, което ви сърби след ужасен нощен сън или около 16 часа по време на стресиращ работен ден? Отговорът обикновено е захар, защото се използва като моментално гориво за клетките на тялото ни.<br/><br/>Вместо това посегнете към ябълки с масло от ядки. "Ако нападате запасите от бонбони на колегите си, препоръчвам по-бавно изгарящи въглехидрати с източник на мазнини или протеини", казва Ленчевски. "За разлика от обикновената захар, това ще захрани клетките ви, като същевременно ще избегне катастрофата след захарта. Две възможности, които правят за големи пикап-ме-нагоре следващия път, когато сте жаден бонбони: нарязана ябълка с вашия избор на ядково масло, или плодове с 2% неподсладено гръцко кисело мляко. " Харесва ни да размазваме сладкия зъб с тези пристрастяващи кокосови стърготини – те се пълнят, без добавена захар и са толкова добри.<br/><br/>Ако си жаден за сол<br/><br/>Това означава: "Ако нищо друго, освен най-солената туршия, няма да пиете достатъчно H2O", казва Ленчевски. "Солта помага на тялото да се държи за вода, затова я жадуваме, когато имаме нужда от течности."<br/><br/>Вместо това, посегнете към водата. "Остани хидратирана, особено когато наближаваме летните месеци", казва тя. Следващият път, когато се появи желание, опитайте да го утолите (буквално) с няколко освежаващи чаши и може да откриете, че неотложността към натриевия гуляй изчезва. "Ако обикновената вода ви отегчава, опитайте да добавите мента, лимон или замразени плодове, за да го разбъркате", казва Ленчевски. И ако това все още не върши работа, има по-здравословна алтернатива на чипс или пържени картофи. "Ако наистина просто жадувате за сол в края на краищата, препечените водорасли са чудесен нискокалоричен вариант", казва тя.<br/><br/>Ако сте жаден нишестени въглехидрати като тестени изделия<br/><br/>Това означава: "Тъй като храните с високо съдържание на въглехидрати повишават хормона на доброто настроение серотонин, гладът за нишесте може да бъде знак, че се нуждаете от бустер за настроение", казва Ленчевски.<br/><br/>Вместо това, посегнете за баня! "Избийте солите на Епсом, защото е време за някои сериозни R + R", казва Ленчевски. "Повярвайте ми. Отдаването на нишесте безплатно за всичко се чувства наистина добре в момента, но вероятно ще ви изпепели повече на следващия ден." (Както всеки, който някога е прекалил с пицата или пастата, знае.) Така че следващия път, когато искате да се потопите първо в купа с въглехидрати, нарисувайте вана, запалете свещ и се поглезете без никакво съжаление или плътни калории.<br/><br/>Ако си жаден за сладолед<br/><br/>5 / 6 години<br/><br/>Това означава: "Вашето тяло може да ви казва, че се нуждае от някои здравословни мазнини."<br/><br/>Вместо това посегнете към кокосовия сладолед. "Аз съм реалист, така че ако ви се прииска сладолед, няма да препоръчам шепа орехи, които, разбира се, са пълни със здравословни мазнини", казва Ленчевски. "За сладолед спешни случаи, аз препоръчвам с по-ниско съдържание на захар кокосови сладоледи като Coconut Bliss или Kippy на три съставки сладолед в Лос Анджелис." Можем да гарантираме за факта, че кокосов сладолед вкус невероятно и точно като истинското нещо.<br/><br/>Ако си жаден за бургер<br/><br/>Означава: Нуждаете се от желязо. "Ако не можете да спрете да мислите за червено месо, има шанс тялото ви да жадува за желязо, b12 и фолиева киселина", казва Ленчевски. "Това е особено вярно по време или около това време на месеца."<br/><br/>Вместо това, посегнете към по-здравословен бургер. "Аз съм привърженик на хранени с трева, антибиотици и червено месо без хормони веднъж седмично", казва Ленчевски. "Опитайте се да експериментирате с отворен бизонски бургер, който, нарязан за рязане, е по-икономична и има повече желязо, отколкото говеждо месо." Опитайте се да включите някакъв вид добавка на желязо на растителна основа в ежедневието си, като спирулина. |

| Web Services, Vendors And Cyber Laws!<br/><br/>Updated On:April 21, 2014Bilal Ahmad<br/><br/>Computerization of this world changed human performance scenario to a great extent and that too beyond measurement. For instance, Now you can send vital information all across the globe with a single mouse click, thanks to internet connectivity. Sadly, it is this wide connectivity and popularity among people, internet has also increased chances for computer crimes. Internet crimes or computer crimes are widely known as 'Cyber Crimes'.<br/><br/>'Cyber Laws' is something new in the judiciary system but has gained a lot of attention lately. The term cyber crime is something very synonymous with conventional crime, the only difference being medium of execution. There are majorly two types of cyber crimes, the first one is in which computers are the main targets and these include cases of data damage, malicious code and even criminal data access. The second one is in which computer is only a tool using which conventional crimes are committed for eg cyber terrorism, spamming, cyber stalking and many more.<br/><br/>This is where a website consultant or a vendor comes into scene. Although not aware of all the cyber laws present till date, a website vendor can advise you on some of the most vital cyber laws while creating your site.<br/><br/>This may include common knowledge of copy rights or even protecting the content of your own website. Explaining you all the rights you posses as a website owner is also one the tasks a website vendor may do while developing your website. A vendor can also assist you by offering you information on different cyber laws to protect data. Besides all of this, a vendor can also offer you information on any new cyber law that you may not be aware of till know. Cyber laws may vary from nation to nation, one recent example can be of the cookie law released in the United Kingdom, which prevents the website from saving any user browsing data. As per the Cookie Law, websites in the United Kingdom cannot save cookie files without informational consent from the surfer.<br/><br/>It is after the implementation of such law, websites now have a pop-up window, which seeks the consent of the visitor for saving cookies files. Such files are used by websites to analyze the browsing pattern of visitors based on which advertisements are then posted on a user window. With hacking not anymore a new thing for all of us, do you think such rules and regulations can prevent online forgery or cyber crime? Technology has developed at a rapid rate but still people do not prefer shopping online due to fear of personal or bank account details getting hacked. With the rise of cyber crime, need of stringent cyber laws have also increased to curb the same and to promote a risk free shopping experience.<br/><br/>Classes of Cyber Crimes<br/><br/>Over the years there have been three major classes of cyber crimes:<br/><br/>Unauthorized access of computer system cases, which involves hacking or stealing usernames and passwords to gain access over personal information of the respective user. These kind of backdoor access are organized with the help of Trojan Horse. Releasing malicious programs like Trojan House, worms or computer viruses etc. The last class includes cyber stalking a user or online harassment .<br/><br/>Direct implications of Cyber crimes<br/><br/>Decrease in sales<br/><br/>Decrease in staff output due to network delays<br/><br/>Loss of personalized information like research work<br/><br/>Disruption in communication process<br/><br/>Indirect implications of Cyber crimes<br/><br/>Credibility issue in our financial system<br/><br/>Brand image is tarnished in the market<br/><br/>Cyber crimes affect business to business relationship in the market<br/><br/>Sense of trust in state policies and government agencies is lost<br/><br/>Preventing Cyber Crime<br/><br/>As netizens there are certain precautions that we should consider for a safe and secure online experience. Here are some of them:<br/><br/>First thing to do will be to keep personal information to your self and avoid sharing the same online.<br/><br/>Avoid sharing any photographs with online chat friends or strangers.<br/><br/>Installing latest version of anti-virus on your system can offer you a good line of defense against internet threats like viruses and malware.<br/><br/>Keeping back up of your valuable data is a good option to avoid problems like virus contamination.<br/><br/>Avoid sending credit card information to sites that are unsecured and don't have any valid certificate.<br/><br/>Installing safety programme that offers you control over site cookies and saves you from being tracked by websites.<br/><br/>Putting host-based intrusions detection devices on servers will help you keep track of irregularities on your website traffic.<br/><br/>Use of firewall is advised.<br/><br/>Why Cyber attacks are so popular?<br/><br/>Cheaper than traditional cheating methods<br/><br/>Tracking cyber crimes are not easy<br/><br/>Exact locations cannot be tracked easily<br/><br/>Absence of physical barrier in the internet world<br/><br/>Cyber crimes affect large number of people<br/><br/>Conclusion<br/><br/>The fact that human mind has unfathomable power is undeniable, which is why internet crimes are increasing at a tremendous rate. Even history has witnessed some of the greatest internet security gone kaput by the hands of hackers, who have easily got away too. The only way to curb such crime is to remain aware of the cyber laws that we have today, that can either be through internet or through website/IT vendors. Information Technology Act has to be balanced in such a way that it proves too stringent for people who are involved in cyber crimes and at the same time it should never hamper the growth of Internet industry.<br/><br/>Author Bio:– Maneet Puri at present is heading a quality web design firm located at New Delhi, India.

He is also an avid writer and some of his commended work have been published on renowned websites | Уеб услуги, доставчици и кибер закони!<br/><br/>Актуализирано на:April 21, 2014Bilal Ahmad<br/><br/>Компютъризацията на този свят промени сценария на човешкото представяне до голяма степен и това твърде отвъд измерването. Например, Сега можете да изпратите жизненоважна информация по целия свят с едно кликване на мишката, благодарение на интернет свързаността. За съжаление, именно тази широка свързаност и популярност сред хората, интернет също е увеличил шансовете за компютърни престъпления. Интернет престъпления или компютърни престъпления са широко известни като "Киберпрестъпления".<br/><br/>"Киберзаконите" е нещо ново в съдебната система, но напоследък е спечелило много внимание. Терминът киберпрестъпления е нещо много синоним на конвенционалната престъпност, като единствената разлика е средството за изпълнение. Има основно два вида кибер престъпления, първият от които е, че компютрите са основните цели и те включват случаи на увреждане на данни, злонамерен код и дори достъп до криминални данни. Вторият е, в който компютърът е само инструмент, с помощта на който се извършват конвенционални престъпления за напр. кибертероризъм, спам, кибер дебнене и много други.<br/><br/>Това е мястото, където уеб сайт консултант или продавач идва в сцена. Въпреки че не е наясно с всички кибер закони присъстват до дата, уеб сайт продавач може да ви посъветва за някои от най-важните кибер закони при създаването на вашия сайт.<br/><br/>Това може да включва общо познаване на правата за копиране или дори защита на съдържанието на собствения ви уебсайт. Обясняването на всички права, които притежавате като собственик на уебсайт, също е една от задачите, които продавачът на уебсайтове може да направи, докато разработва вашия уебсайт. Продавачът може също така да ви помогне, като ви предложи информация за различни кибер закони за защита на данните. Освен всичко това, продавачът може да ви предложи информация за всеки нов кибер закон, за който може да не сте наясно, докато не знаете. Кибер законите могат да се различават в различните държави, един скорошен пример може да бъде законът за бисквитките, издаден в Обединеното кралство, който не позволява на уебсайта да запазва данни за сърфирането на потребителите. Съгласно Закона за бисквитките, уебсайтовете в Обединеното кралство не могат да съхраняват файлове с бисквитки без информативно съгласие от страна на сърфиста.<br/><br/>Именно след прилагането на такъв закон, уебсайтовете вече имат изскачащ прозорец, който търси съгласието на посетителя за запазване на файлове с бисквитки. Такива файлове се използват от уебсайтовете за анализ на модела на сърфиране на посетителите въз основа на това кои реклами след това се публикуват в потребителски прозорец. С хакването вече не е нещо ново за всички нас, мислите ли, че такива правила и разпоредби могат да предотвратят онлайн фалшификация или кибер престъпления? Технологиите се развиват с бързи темпове, но все още хората не предпочитат да пазаруват онлайн поради страх от хакване на лични или банкови данни. С възхода на кибер престъпността, необходимостта от строги кибер закони също се увеличи, за да се ограничи същото и да се насърчи безрисковото пазаруване.<br/><br/>Класове киберпрестъпления<br/><br/>През годините е имало три основни класа кибер престъпления:<br/><br/>Неоторизиран достъп до случаи на компютърни системи, който включва хакване или кражба на потребителски имена и пароли, за да се получи достъп до лична информация на съответния потребител. Този вид достъп до задни врати се организира с помощта на Trojan Horse. Освобождаване на злонамерени програми като Trojan House, червеи или компютърни вируси и т.н. Последният клас включва кибер дебнене на потребител или онлайн тормоз .<br/><br/>Директни последици от киберпрестъпленията<br/><br/>Намаляване на продажбите<br/><br/>Намаляване на производителността на персонала поради забавяне на мрежата<br/><br/>Загуба на персонализирана информация като изследователска работа<br/><br/>Прекъсване в комуникационния процес<br/><br/>Непреки последици от киберпрестъпленията<br/><br/>Въпрос на доверие във финансовата ни система<br/><br/>Образът на марката е опетнен на пазара<br/><br/>Киберпрестъпленията влияят на бизнес отношенията на пазара<br/><br/>Чувството на доверие в държавните политики и правителствените агенции се губи<br/><br/>Предотвратяване на киберпрестъпленията<br/><br/>Като интернет потребители има някои предпазни мерки, които трябва да вземем предвид за безопасно и сигурно онлайн преживяване. Ето някои от тях:<br/><br/>Първото нещо, което трябва да направите, е да запазите лична информация за себе си и да избегнете споделянето на една и съща онлайн.<br/><br/>Избягвайте да споделяте снимки с онлайн чат приятели или непознати.<br/><br/>Инсталирането на най-новата версия на антивирус на вашата система може да ви предложи добра линия на защита срещу интернет заплахи като вируси и злонамерен софтуер.<br/><br/>Поддържането на резервно копие на ценните ви данни е добър вариант за избягване на проблеми като заразяване с вируси.<br/><br/>Избягвайте да изпращате информация за кредитни карти на сайтове, които са необезпечени и нямат валиден сертификат.<br/><br/>Инсталиране на програма за безопасност, която ви предлага контрол върху бисквитките на сайта и ви предпазва от проследяване от уебсайтове.<br/><br/>Поставянето на устройства за откриване на прониквания на сървъри, базирани на хост, ще ви помогне да следите за нередности в трафика на уебсайта си.<br/><br/>Препоръчва се използването на защитна стена.<br/><br/>Защо кибер атаките са толкова популярни?<br/><br/>По-евтини от традиционните методи за измама<br/><br/>Проследяването на кибер престъпленията не е лесно<br/><br/>Точните места не могат да бъдат проследени лесно.<br/><br/>Липса на физическа бариера в интернет света<br/><br/>Киберпрестъпленията засягат голям брой хора<br/><br/>Заключение<br/><br/>Фактът, че човешкият ум има неизмерима сила, е неоспорим, поради което престъпленията в интернет се увеличават с огромна скорост. Дори историята е свидетел на някои от най-големите интернет сигурност отиде kaput от ръцете на хакери, които лесно са се измъкнали също. Единственият начин да се ограничи такова престъпление е да останем наясно с кибер-законите, които имаме днес, които могат да бъдат или чрез интернет или чрез уеб сайтове / IT доставчици. Законът за информационните технологии трябва да бъде балансиран по такъв начин, че да се окаже твърде строг за хората, които участват в кибер престъпления, и в същото време никога да не възпрепятства растежа на интернет индустрията.<br/><br/>Автор Bio: – Maneet Puri в момента оглавява фирма за качествен уеб дизайн, разположена в Ню Делхи, Индия.
