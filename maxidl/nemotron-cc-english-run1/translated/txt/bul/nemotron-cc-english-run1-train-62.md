| Abstract<br/><br/>There are an estimated 3.5 million mosques worldwide. The relatively large surface area of most mosque rooftops and their ubiquity in the Muslim world make them excellent candidates for solar photovoltaic (PV) installations. Muslims congregate for prayers at mosques five times a day: at dawn, noon, afternoon, sunset, and evening. Because these times are governed by the sun, they change chronographically within the year, according to the season, but are perpetual. As such, mosque electricity load profiles are highly predictable across each year and experience limited annual variation.<br/><br/>Authors<br/><br/>Amro Elshurafa<br/><br/>Research FellowAmro is a research fellow with 15 years of research experience on three continents in the fields of technology and energy.

| Why are Explosion Proof Lights Different?<br/>(4/22/2010) When the conditions are right in any of these settings, the only thing keeping the unthinkable from happening is the lack of an ignition source. In an atmosphere that has become contaminated with volatile gases, or heavily saturated with combustible dust, all it takes is one tiny spark to set in motion a chain of reactions that can lead to fires, explosions, and injuries.<br/><br/>In many of these settings, it is in fact common for a flammable atmosphere to be present, and there is no practical way to completely avoid producing these conditions. Because these conditions are often created as a part of the normal operations of industry and cannot be totally negated, the next obvious solution is to remove all possible sources of ignition. Doing this is easier said than done, since in industry there are so many sources that must be considered. Everything from light switches to fans are possible sources of ignition, and they simply cannot be entirely removed the workspace. It's because of this that specialized versions of equipment that must be operated in these hazardous environments have been developed and are mandated for use in hazardous locations by OSHA.<br/><br/>Equipment for use in hazardous locations has several ratings and categories that indicate the suitability of the equipment for use depending upon the level of danger a particular location may create. For the control of ignition sources, most regulations deal in mandating either intrinsically safe electrical equipment, or explosion proof equipment. The differences between the two are subtle, but important. Intrinsically safe equipment is basically any equipment that is incapable of producing sufficient energy to cause ignition. Explosion proof refers to equipment that can contain and isolate possible sources of ignition, preventing them from making contact with the open air. It would seem obvious that intrinsically safe would be the highest safety rating, and in fact it is. Intrinsically safe rated equipment is suitable for use in all the hazardous location groups and ratings as defined by OSHA regulations. Despite this, intrinsically safe equipment is not always the best choice because of the limitations created by its higher costs and generally low power characteristics.<br/><br/>Explosion proof equipment on the other hand is not as constrained by the limitations imposed by the intrinsically safe rating, and allows for a broader and more powerful spectrum of equipment to be used, and at cheaper cost. Since the explosion proof rating only requires that sources of ignition be contained, and temperatures be kept below certain levels for varying division ratings, the basic design of equipment can remain intact, with additional design incorporated to contain its normally open sources of possible ignition. A basic example would be a simple light switch. In normal conditions, a light switch has at its core a contact point where two metal conductors are put into contact with each other to form a closed circuit, thereby transferring electrical energy to the lamp.<br/><br/>It is at this contact point that a possible ignition source is created as the two conductors come into contact with each other and produce a small spark or arc. Isolating this spark can be as simple as encasing the entire switch within a sealed and non conductive exterior such as rubber, thereby removing the conductive portion of the switch from contact with the outside atmosphere.This is a greatly simplified example, but it demonstrates the basic premise. To better understand the full premise behind making electrical equipment explosion proof, and just how much is involved in the design, it is better to look at something a bit more complicated.<br/><br/>One of the first things you'll note is how different this drop light's appearance is from ordinary drop lights. While the overall shape and design appearance is the same, it is somewhat stouter and much more rugged looking. This is due to the necessity of incorporating a stronger basic body assembly. As well as sealing possible sources of ignition from contact with flammable dust or vapors, the assembly must be able to contain any ignition of gases within its housing; if a bulb were to explode, or gases to get inside and ignite, the housing is capable of containing these long enough for them to cool below ignition temperatures before they can escape. In a traditional drop light, there is no sealing, and the assembly is a great deal less rugged.<br/><br/>The next thing you would notice is that the lamp is constructed of non sparking materials. The body is made from high strength composites, the metal cage and lamp housing is aluminum, and the cord is chemical and abrasion resistant. This allows the lamp to be accidentally dropped, and greatly reduces the chances that an errant spark is created when it contacts the ground. Further enhancing the safety of the lamp is a clear impact resistant enclosure that seals the bulb itself from the outside environment. The bulb and the enclosure are both protected from impacts by a strong aluminum cage, reducing the chances of damages from impacts. Traditional drop lights have little to no concern for the metals used in construction aside from production cost, and rely on thin steel and tin for most of their metallic components.<br/><br/>In this particular lamp, LEDs are used instead of a typical incandescent or fluorescent bulb. These LEDs create less heat than traditional bulbs, and produce a greater amount of light with less power. As well as being more efficient, the LEDs are also a great deal more resistant to damage from dropping or impacts. Traditional bulbs rely on a fragile tungsten filament to produce light through resistance to electrical current. This fragile filament is easily broken by vibration or impacts. As well as being easily damaged, a traditional bulb relies on a gas filled enclosure surrounding the filament to increase the life of the filament. This glass enclosure is also easily broken, and represents an ignition hazard if it breaks during use and exposes the hot filament to an explosive atmosphere. With the LED bulb, there is no gas filled enclosure to break, and no heated filament to present an ignition source. This has the effect of further improving this lamps resistance to creating an errant ignition source.<br/><br/>Lastly, you'll note that all the parts of this assembly are tightly and securely sealed together. Unlike traditional lamps, all the seams and connections are sealed with gaskets and fillers that isolate the internal electronics of the unit from the outside. Contaminants are kept out, and possible ignitions are kept in, removing the possibility of a chance ignition of the volatile compounds that may be present.<br/><br/>As well as being ruggedly designed and explosion proof, this lamp is also very energy efficient. The LED bulb uses a fraction of the power a normal bulb consumes. At only 7 watts, this LED lamp produces the light equivalent of a standard 100 watt incandescent. The life of the LED is significantly longer as well, with the LED bulb rated at approximately 50,000 hours of life, while a traditional incandescent is typically rated well below 5000 hours. This means less trouble and expense with replacing the bulb. As well as consuming less energy, the LED bulb produces far less heat. In a standard drop light, none of the above features are present. It is commonly understood that frequent bulb replacements and occasional burns from contact with the hot housing assembly are a part of using the standard incandescent lamp. Not so with LEDs.<br/><br/>As you can see, there is a great deal of consideration and design that goes into creating a high quality piece of explosion proof equipment. Although the basic premise is still to produce a simple and efficient source of illumination, the added requirements of an explosion proof rating increases the demands for durability and ruggedness. In these lamps provided by Larson Electronics, those requirements are met and exceeded. | Защо взривоопасните светлини са различни?<br/>(4/22/2010) Когато условията са правилни в някоя от тези настройки, единственото нещо, което пречи на немислимото да се случи, е липсата на източник на запалване. В атмосфера, която е замърсена с летливи газове или силно наситена с горим прах, всичко, което е необходимо, е една малка искра, за да се задейства верига от реакции, които могат да доведат до пожари, експлозии и наранявания.<br/><br/>В много от тези условия всъщност е обичайно наличието на запалима атмосфера и няма практически начин напълно да се избегне производството на тези условия. Тъй като тези условия често се създават като част от нормалните операции на индустрията и не могат да бъдат напълно отречени, следващото очевидно решение е да се премахнат всички възможни източници на запалване. Правейки това е по-лесно да се каже, отколкото да се направи, тъй като в индустрията има толкова много източници, които трябва да бъдат взети под внимание. Всичко от превключвателите на светлината до вентилаторите са възможни източници на запалване и те просто не могат да бъдат напълно премахнати работното пространство. Именно поради това специализирани версии на оборудване, което трябва да се работи в тези опасни среди са разработени и са упълномощени за използване в опасни места от OSHA.<br/><br/>Оборудването за използване на опасни места има няколко рейтинга и категории, които показват годността на оборудването за използване в зависимост от нивото на опасност, което определено място може да създаде. За контрол на източниците на запалване, повечето разпоредби се занимават с задължително или неизменно безопасно електрическо оборудване, или взривоустойчиво оборудване. Разликите между двете са фини, но важни. Вътрешно безопасно оборудване е основно всяко оборудване, което не е в състояние да произвежда достатъчно енергия, за да предизвика запалване. Експлозионното доказателство се отнася до оборудване, което може да съдържа и изолира възможни източници на запалване, като им пречи да осъществят контакт с открития въздух. Би изглеждало очевидно, че вътрешно безопасното би било най-високата степен на безопасност и всъщност е така. Вътрешно безопасното оборудване е подходящо за използване във всички опасни групи и рейтинги за местоположение, както е определено от наредбите на OSHA. Въпреки това, по същество безопасното оборудване не винаги е най-добрият избор поради ограниченията, създадени от по-високите му разходи и като цяло ниските характеристики на мощността.<br/><br/>Оборудването за взривобезопасност, от друга страна, не е толкова ограничено от ограниченията, наложени от вътрешно безопасния рейтинг, и позволява да се използва по-широк и по-мощен спектър от оборудване и на по-ниска цена. Тъй като взривоустойчивостта изисква само източниците на запалване да бъдат ограничени, а температурите да се държат под определени нива за различни класове на деление, основният дизайн на оборудването може да остане непокътнат, като допълнителният дизайн е вграден, за да съдържа неговите нормално отворени източници на възможно запалване. Основен пример би бил обикновен превключвател на светлината. В нормални условия превключвателят на светлината има в основата си контактна точка, където два метални проводника са поставени в контакт един с друг, за да образуват затворена верига, като по този начин прехвърлят електрическа енергия към лампата.<br/><br/>Именно в тази точка на контакт се създава възможен източник на запалване, тъй като двата проводника влизат в контакт помежду си и произвеждат малка искра или дъга. Изолирането на тази искра може да бъде толкова просто, колкото затварянето на целия превключвател в запечатан и непроводим екстериор като каучук, като по този начин се отстранява проводимата част на превключвателя от контакт с външната атмосфера. Това е много опростен пример, но той демонстрира основната предпоставка. За да се разбере по-добре пълната предпоставка зад вземане на електрическо оборудване експлозия доказателство, и точно колко е включена в дизайна, е по-добре да погледнете нещо малко по-сложно.<br/><br/>Едно от първите неща, които ще забележите, е колко различен е външният вид на тази падаща светлина от обикновените падащи светлини. Докато цялостната форма и дизайн са еднакви, тя е малко по-твърда и много по-здрава. Това се дължи на необходимостта от включване на по-силен основен монтаж на тялото. Както и запечатване на възможни източници на запалване от контакт със запалим прах или пари, събранието трябва да може да съдържа всяко запалване на газове в корпуса си; ако крушката трябва да избухне или газовете да влязат вътре и да се запалят, корпусът е в състояние да ги задържи достатъчно дълго, за да се охладят под температурата на запалване, преди да могат да избягат. В традиционната падаща светлина няма уплътняване, а монтажът е много по-малко здрав.<br/><br/>Следващото нещо, което ще забележите, е, че лампата е изработена от не искри материали. Тялото е изработено от високоякостни композити, металната клетка и корпусът на лампата е алуминий, а кабелът е химически и устойчив на абразия. Това позволява лампата да бъде случайно изпусната и значително намалява шансовете при контакт със земята да се създаде искра. Допълнително повишаване на безопасността на лампата е ясен удароустойчив корпус, който запечатва самата крушка от външната среда. Крушката и заграждението са защитени от удари от здрава алуминиева клетка, намалявайки шансовете за повреди от удари. Традиционните падащи светлини имат малко или никакво безпокойство за металите, използвани в строителството, освен производствените разходи, и разчитат на тънка стомана и калай за повечето от металните си компоненти.<br/><br/>В тази конкретна лампа се използват светодиоди вместо типична крушка с нажежаема жичка или флуоресцентна крушка. Тези светодиоди създават по-малко топлина от традиционните крушки и произвеждат по-голямо количество светлина с по-малка мощност. Освен че са по-ефективни, светодиодите са и много по-устойчиви на повреди от падане или удари. Традиционните крушки разчитат на крехка волфрамова жичка, за да произвеждат светлина чрез устойчивост на електрически ток. Тази крехка нишка лесно се чупи от вибрации или удари. Освен че е лесно повредена, традиционната крушка разчита на запълнена с газ обвивка около спиралата, за да увеличи живота на спиралата. Това стъклено заграждение също е лесно счупено и представлява опасност от запалване, ако се счупи по време на употреба и изложи горещата спирала на експлозивна атмосфера. С LED крушката няма корпус, пълен с газ, който да се счупи, и няма нагрят филамент, който да представи източник на запалване. Това има ефект на по-нататъшно подобряване на това съпротивление на лампите, за да се създаде източник на запалване.<br/><br/>И накрая, ще забележите, че всички части на този монтаж са плътно и здраво запечатани заедно. За разлика от традиционните лампи, всички шевове и връзки са запечатани с уплътнения и пълнители, които изолират вътрешната електроника на устройството отвън. Замърсителите се държат навън, а възможните запалителни устройства се държат вътре, премахвайки възможността за случайно запалване на летливите съединения, които могат да присъстват.<br/><br/>Освен че е здраво проектирана и взривоустойчива, тази лампа също е много енергийно ефективна. LED крушката използва част от мощността, която консумира нормална крушка. Само при 7 вата тази LED лампа произвежда светлинен еквивалент на стандартен 100 вата нажежаема жичка. Животът на светодиода също е значително по-дълъг, като LED крушката е оценена на приблизително 50 000 часа живот, докато традиционният нажежаема жичка обикновено се оценява доста под 5000 часа. Това означава по-малко проблеми и разходи със замяната на крушката. Освен че консумира по-малко енергия, LED крушката произвежда много по-малко топлина. При стандартна падаща светлина нито една от горните характеристики не е налице. Обикновено се разбира, че честите замени на крушки и случайни изгаряния от контакт с горещия корпус са част от използването на стандартната лампа с нажежаема жичка. Не е така с светодиодите.<br/><br/>Както можете да видите, има много внимание и дизайн, който отива в създаването на висококачествено оборудване за взривобезопасност. Въпреки че основната предпоставка все още е да се произведе прост и ефикасен източник на осветление, добавените изисквания за степен на взривоустойчивост увеличават изискванията за издръжливост и здравина. В тези лампи, предоставени от Larson Electronics, тези изисквания са изпълнени и надвишени. |
| Some photographers think a cloudy day yields better light than a sunny. It's true that sunny light can be a little difficult to contain but if you can harness it well, the results can be spectacular. This shoot occurred on a pretty dreary day but the light did yield some beautifully soft light that gave some of the objects a rich, buttery feel to them. | Някои фотографи смятат, че облачният ден дава по-добра светлина от слънчевия. Вярно е, че слънчевата светлина може да бъде малко трудна за задържане, но ако можете да я впрегнете добре, резултатите могат да бъдат грандиозни. Тази снимка се случи в доста мрачен ден, но светлината даде някаква красиво мека светлина, която даде на някои от предметите богато, маслено усещане за тях. |
