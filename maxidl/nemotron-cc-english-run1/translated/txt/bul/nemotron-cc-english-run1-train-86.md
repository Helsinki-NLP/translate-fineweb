| Leclaire<br/><br/>The historic Leclaire neighborhood, once referred to as Edwardsville's "suburb to the south," was founded as a cooperative community in 1890 and remained a separate village until annexed to the city of Edwardsville in 1934. Newspapers and magazines throughout the United States and Europe reported on the Leclaire experiment, particularly during the first 20 years of its existence. In 1979, due to its unique history, the former village was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.<br/><br/>Leclaire was founded by Nelson Oliver Nelson, a St. Louis plumbing manufacturer who, for many years, sought to advance the plight of the working class. Nelson wanted to improve working conditions for his employees and provide housing near the factories so workers and their families could easily participate in recreational and educational programs offered free of charge by the company. Prior to 1890, while still in St. Louis, the N. O. Nelson Company's manufacturing and distribution businesses began providing profit sharing along with educational and recreational opportunities. The Leclaire cooperative experiment would bring additional benefits.<br/><br/>When Nelson employees indicated they wanted to relocate to a rural location, company representatives approached leaders of small towns in several Missouri and Illinois communities near their St. Louis headquarters. They were looking for a suitable property to build new factories and a model village. South of Edwardsville they found a 125-acre tract of land with access to water, coal, and transportation. Local businessmen acted quickly to offer a financial incentive. In less than three weeks, the community raised a fund of $20,000 from individual contributions of between $1 and $1,000 to entice Nelson to choose Edwardsville for his enterprise.<br/><br/>City leaders had hoped to locate property inside the city limits of Edwardsville, but when no suitable site could be found, they were confident that the Nelson investment south of town would soon become a part of Edwardsville. Although Nelson fulfilled all the contingencies for construction and job creation in his contract, it would be 44 years before annexation to Edwardsville. Leclaire, bounded by Madison/Brown Avenues to the east, the railroad tracks to the west, Hadley/McKinley Avenues on the south and Wolf Street to the north, remained an independent village from 1890 to 1934. During that time it earned a reputation for innovations in business, education and residential planning.<br/><br/>The village of Leclaire on a 1931 map of Edwardsville<br/>Courtesy of Paul Jenkins<br/><br/>Nelson's decision to build a village was not made on a whim. By the late 1880s he was an international leader in the fields of cooperation and profit-sharing, exchanging social theories with others around the world while expanding his St. Louis business. He named his experimental village after the Parisian profit-sharer, Edme Jean Leclaire, but he visited many other social visionaries who provided information and inspiration. Compiling the best ideas from these examples, Nelson founded Leclaire to, in his words, "give work, promote intelligence, provide recreation, foster beauty, and make homes." These were all factors he determined necessary for men to lead fulfilling lives. Later writers used these words to formulate Leclaire's founding principles: Work, Homes, Education, Recreation, and Beauty, but with the additional important principle of Freedom.<br/><br/>Work<br/><br/>Work could be considered the most important of these factors since without the factory jobs in Leclaire, there would be no village. The brick factory buildings were designed by architect E. A. Cameron to provide natural light, ventilation in the summer, and heated floors in the winter. There was a fire suppression system and, although industrial accidents were not eliminated, every effort was made to guarantee the safety of the workers. The ivy-covered brick buildings were surrounded by well-manicured lawns and flower gardens giving the complex a campus-like appearance. In 1894, New York World reporter Nellie Bly called the buildings "the ideal perfection of buildings for man to labor in".<br/><br/>The manufacturing complex of the N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company in Leclaire<br/>From Friends of Leclaire<br/><br/>Nelson company policies were designed to protect the financial stability of employees. Workers could earn a share of the profits and have a voice in the company if they chose that option. The profit-sharing plan gave Nelson employees a pride of ownership that resulted in a supportive workforce. There were a few short-lived labor strikes over the years, but for the most part, labor problems were rare. Workers also had reasonable hours and competitive wages. There was a provident fund that provided for pensions and sick leave, as well as widow pensions if a worker died, whether or not the death was related to his employment.<br/><br/>Company headquarters for the N. O. Nelson Company (NONCO) remained in St. Louis, but all of the N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company was moved to Leclaire. The manufacturing company was divided into shops that made a variety of products. In 1900, the shops became independent companies for tax purposes, but all were still owned by the N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company. The shops included the Cabinet Mill where wood products from cabinetry to millwork were produced. The skilled craftsmen that worked here also fulfilled special contracts, including teller cages for a local bank and an altar still in use at St. Andrew's Episcopal Church in Edwardsville. The Marble Shop specialized in architectural marble that was cut and installed by Nelson crews in homes, businesses, and even state capitols throughout the Midwest. The Machine Shop, which became Bignall and Keeler, made pipe fitting machines, pumps, gauges, and various mechanical tools expected in the plumbing trade. They also branched out to manufacture specialty items like the Leclaire Bicycle in the mid-1890s. The Brass Shop included a foundry where various plumbing pipes and tools were manufactured. These examples represent just some of the work done in the Leclaire factories. The company's logo was a stylized "NONCO" that can still be seen on plumbing fixtures and some fire hydrants in Edwardsville today.<br/><br/>Homes<br/><br/>Before homes could be built, housing was needed for workers who were completing the factory buildings as well as building homes. To meet those needs, the company built the "Club House," a large building that served many purposes. In addition to lodging, it was the community's first educational building, and it contained a well-stocked library.<br/><br/>Construction of the residential portion of Leclaire began immediately after the village was founded in June of 1890. Julius Pitzman, the innovative landscape architect who laid out the first lots in Leclaire, set them up with a number of protective covenants. The covenants provided for wide, curvilinear streets, large lots, and a deed restriction that limited the properties to residential or educational purposes only. The company paved the streets, provided electric street lights, installed sidewalks, and planted hundreds of trees along the streets of Leclaire. Later sections of Leclaire were laid out with a conventional grid design and smaller lots, but still included the deed restrictions.<br/><br/>A Leclaire Victorian cottage in 1907<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Initially the homes were built by the company and then sold at near cost to Nelson employees to encourage home ownership. If a worker became ill and could not make his mortgage, payments were suspended until after he returned to work. The homes were offered in a variety of house designs and the company advertised that no two dwellings were alike. The earliest homes were primarily Victorian cottages that came with electricity and running water. These were followed by bungalows, foursquares, and even some kit homes. Residents could purchase a company-built home or buy an empty lot and build a house themselves, provided the architectural design met company standards.<br/><br/>In later years, lots were sold to investors, usually Edwardsville residents, and many homes in the 1920s were built by local contractors who then sold them to area residents.<br/><br/>Education<br/><br/>Nelson believed in education for everyone, including the working class. Educational programming began with a kindergarten at the Club House in 1892 and continued in the new educational building at 722 Holyoake Road. Commonly called the "School House," this building provided a large hall for meetings and programs, but had moveable partitions to divide it into classroom space during the day. In the evenings, there were dances, meetings, or programs of the Leclaire Self-Culture Club which featured weekly lectures by Washington University professors or nationally known speakers who, like N. O. Nelson, were part of the social betterment movement at the turn of the century. These included Jane Addams, Edward Everett Hale, Samuel "Golden Rule" Jones, and author Charlotte Perkins Gilman, among others.<br/><br/>Children enrolled in the Leclaire kindergarten in 1913<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>In the ten years following the 1895 construction of the education building, there were a series of educational experiments including an industrial school, college, night school, and an academy. The earliest and longest-lived endeavor was the morning kindergarten, founded in 1892, that used the Fröbel Model. This two-year program was free to everyone, including Edwardsville children, until 1931 when for financial reasons the company began charging tuition to students who were not the children of employees. Nelson Manufacturing operated a kindergarten until 1934 when the building was turned over to the Edwardsville School District for a nominal fee.<br/><br/>Recreation<br/><br/>Boaters on Leclaire Lake in 1915<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Recreation was an important feature of Leclaire. The company provided sports facilities for baseball, tennis, and later, football. A bowling and billiard hall was constructed and there was a lake for boating, swimming, fishing, or ice skating in winter. Leclaire Park was furnished with boathouses, male & female bath houses, and a large pavilion. Residents organized dances, hayrides, spelling bees, and other activities, and the company sponsored a band that played regularly at entertainments in the village or in Edwardsville. Like the educational functions at the Club House and School House, the recreational facilities at Leclaire were open to all and were often a destination for Edwardsville and even St. Louis visitors.<br/><br/>Beauty<br/><br/>Early photograph of Leclaire Lake<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>The last of the factors Nelson deemed important for a satisfying life concerned the environment. Nelson knew about the importance of healthy living. He valued the beauty and cleanliness that could be found in the country, and encouraged all in Leclaire to beautify their property by planting gardens and orchards. Nelson himself led by example, so a company greenhouse provided free flowers and competitions were held for the most beautiful yards. Leclaire was laid out so that the entire village had a park-like setting still evident today.<br/><br/>Freedom<br/><br/>The Leclaire Cooperative store<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Nelson listed five founding principles for Leclaire, but modern writers add a sixth: Freedom. All of the programs offered by the company were available to employees as well as local residents, but none were mandatory. The freedom to choose whether or not to participate in company programs was entirely up to the individual. Residents of Leclaire could work for Nelson Manufacturing or elsewhere, and workers were under no obligation to live in Leclaire. Participation in recreational and educational programs was also optional. There was also a company store where employees could shop, but unlike other company towns, no one was in debt to the company store. The Leclaire Store was a cooperative where members were charged fair market prices, but were then paid quarterly dividends.<br/><br/>A Different Company Town<br/><br/>All of these benefits made Leclaire unique from other company towns. But there were also individual instances where the company showed compassion and care for the employees. The company closed the factories and hired excursion trains to take workers and their families to St. Louis for a day at the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair. When money was tight, Nelson would occasionally place extra cash in each pay envelope to make life easier for workers, and if he instituted a program the men did not agree with, they talked it out and, as often as not, Nelson would reverse himself.<br/><br/>Born in Lillesand, Norway, in 1841, N. O. Nelson was a complicated man. He was a capitalist who believed in free enterprise, but also a socialist, a follower of the "Golden Rule", and a patriot who served for the Union in the Civil War. By 1900, he was a multimillionaire, but by the time of his death in 1922, he had given it all away for the betterment of the working class.<br/><br/>Although Leclaire was not Nelson's only social experiment, it is considered his most successful endeavor. Other major efforts for social betterment included a chain of co-operative grocery stores in New Orleans, a kindergarten for the children of black employees in his Bessemer, Alabama, factories, and a home for consumptives in Indio, California.<br/><br/>Nelson's Village of Leclaire was renowned internationally as a noteworthy and successful experiment. It was described in the New York World on numerous occasions but in particular by reporter Nellie Bly in 1894 who wrote at length about the model town where "The labor question is solved and everybody happy in a little village near St. Louis." The Los Angeles Times also regularly reported on N. O. Nelson, as did the Chicago Daily Tribune and numerous other publications.<br/><br/>In a speech at Leclaire's 15th anniversary celebration in 1915, Nelson said, "Leclaire extends to you a wide open hospitality, and bids you enjoy today the ease and comfort and beauty and inspiration which we enjoy every day." More than a century has passed since that day, but the invitation still stands. Residents and researchers are invited to learn about Leclaire's history and consider the lessons that might be learned for the betterment of future generations.<br/><br/>One of the former buildings of the manufacturing complex in 2019, which now serves as the N. O. Nelson Campus of Lewis and Clark Community College<br/>Photo by Ben Ostermeier<br/><br/>Friends of Leclaire, organized in 1990 following Leclaire's Centennial celebration, promotes the history of Leclaire through a website (historic-leclaire.org), publications, and a festival, Leclaire Parkfest, held annually on the third Sunday in October | Леклер<br/><br/>Историческият квартал Леклер, някога наричан "субурбът на Едуардсвил на юг", е основан като кооперативна общност през 1890 г. и остава отделно село до анексирането му към град Едуардсвил през 1934 г. Вестници и списания в САЩ и Европа съобщават за експеримента на Леклер, особено през първите 20 години от съществуването му. През 1979 г., поради уникалната си история, бившето село е вписано в Националния регистър на историческите места.<br/><br/>Leclaire е основана от Нелсън Оливър Нелсън, производител на водопроводи в Сейнт Луис, който в продължение на много години се стреми да напредне в тежкото положение на работническата класа. Нелсън иска да подобри условията на труд на служителите си и да осигури жилища в близост до фабриките, така че работниците и техните семейства да могат лесно да участват в развлекателни и образователни програми, предлагани безплатно от компанията. Преди 1890 г., докато все още е в Сейнт Луис, производствените и дистрибуторските предприятия на N. O. Nelson Company започват да осигуряват поделяне на печалбата заедно с образователни и развлекателни възможности. Кооперативният експеримент на Леклер би донесъл допълнителни ползи.<br/><br/>Когато служителите на Нелсън посочват, че искат да се преместят на провинциално място, представителите на компанията се обръщат към лидери на малки градове в няколко общности в Мисури и Илинойс близо до централата им в Сейнт Луис. Те търсели подходящ имот за строеж на нови фабрики и примерно село. Южно от Едуардсвил намерили 125 акра земя с достъп до вода, въглища и транспорт. Местните бизнесмени действали бързо, за да предложат финансов стимул. За по-малко от три седмици общността събира фонд от 20 000 долара от индивидуални вноски между 1 и 1000 долара, за да примами Нелсън да избере Едуардсвил за своето предприятие.<br/><br/>Градските лидери се надявали да намерят имот в границите на града Едуардсвил, но когато не можели да намерят подходящо място, те били уверени, че инвестицията на Нелсън на юг от града скоро ще стане част от Едуардсвил. Въпреки че Нелсън изпълнява всички условия за строителство и създаване на работни места в договора си, ще минат 44 години преди анексирането към Едуардсвил. Льоклер, ограничена от Мадисън/Браун авеню на изток, железопътните линии на запад, Хадли/Маккинли авеню на юг и Улф Стрийт на север, остава самостоятелно село от 1890 до 1934 г. През това време тя си спечели репутация за иновации в бизнеса, образованието и жилищното планиране.<br/><br/>Село Леклер на карта на Едуардсвил от 1931 г.<br/>С любезното съдействие на Пол Дженкинс<br/><br/>Решението на Нелсън да построи село не е взето по прищявка. Към края на 1880-те години той е международен лидер в областта на сътрудничеството и подялбата на печалбата, обменяйки социални теории с други хора по света, докато разширява бизнеса си в Сейнт Луис. Той кръщава експерименталното си село на парижкия акционер Едме Жан Льоклер, но посещава много други социални визионери, които предоставят информация и вдъхновение. Съставяйки най-добрите идеи от тези примери, Нелсън основава Leclaire, за да, по думите му, "дава работа, насърчава интелигентността, осигурява отдих, насърчава красотата и прави домове." Това са всички фактори, които той определя като необходими за мъжете, за да водят пълноценен живот. По-късните писатели използват тези думи, за да формулират основополагащите принципи на Льоклер: Работа, Домове, Образование, Отдих и Красота, но с допълнителния важен принцип на Свободата.<br/><br/>Работа<br/><br/>Работата може да се счита за най-важният от тези фактори, тъй като без фабричните работни места в Леклер няма да има село. Сградите на тухлените фабрики са проектирани от архитект Е. А. Камерън, за да осигурят естествена светлина, вентилация през лятото и отопляеми подове през зимата. Съществувала е противопожарна система и, въпреки че промишлените аварии не са елиминирани, са положени всички усилия да се гарантира безопасността на работниците. Покритите с бръшлян тухлени сгради са заобиколени от добре поддържани тревни площи и цветни градини, придаващи на комплекса вид, подобен на кампус. През 1894 г. репортерът от Ню Йорк Уърлд Нели Блай нарича сградите "идеалното съвършенство на сградите, в които човек да работи".<br/><br/>Производственият комплекс на N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company в Леклер<br/>От Приятели на Льоклер<br/><br/>Политиките на компанията Нелсън са създадени, за да защитят финансовата стабилност на служителите. Работниците могат да печелят дял от печалбите и да имат глас в компанията, ако изберат тази опция. Планът за поделяне на печалбата даде на служителите на Нелсън гордост от собствеността, която доведе до подкрепяща работна сила. Имаше няколко краткотрайни трудови стачки през годините, но в по-голямата си част трудовите проблеми бяха редки. Работниците също са имали разумни часове и конкурентни заплати. Имало е провидентски фонд, който е предвиждал пенсии и отпуск по болест, както и пенсии за вдовици, ако работникът е починал, независимо дали смъртта е свързана с работата му.<br/><br/>Седалището на компанията за N. O. Nelson Company (NONCO) остава в Сейнт Луис, но цялата N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company е преместена в Леклер. Производствената компания е разделена на магазини, които произвеждат различни продукти. През 1900 г. магазините стават независими компании за данъчни цели, но всички все още са собственост на N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company. Магазините включват Cabinet Mill, където се произвеждат дървени изделия от шкафове до мелничарски изделия. Опитните занаятчии, които са работили тук, също са изпълнявали специални договори, включително касиерски клетки за местна банка и олтар, който все още се използва в епископалната църква Сейнт Андрюс в Едуардсвил. Мраморният магазин е специализиран в архитектурния мрамор, който е изрязан и монтиран от екипажите на Нелсън в домове, предприятия и дори държавни капители в целия Среден Запад. Машинният магазин, който се превръща в Bignall и Keeler, прави тръбни монтажни машини, помпи, габарити и различни механични инструменти, очаквани в търговията с водопроводи. Те също се разклоняват, за да произвеждат специални артикули като велосипеда Leclaire в средата на 1890-те години. Брас шоп включва леярница, където се произвеждат различни водопроводни тръби и инструменти. Тези примери представляват само част от работата, извършена във фабриките на Леклер. Логото на компанията е стилизирано "NONCO", което все още може да се види по водопроводните инсталации и някои пожарни кранове в Едуардсвил днес.<br/><br/>Домове<br/><br/>Преди домовете да могат да бъдат построени, жилищата са били необходими за работниците, които са завършвали фабричните сгради, както и за изграждане на домове. За да отговори на тези нужди, компанията построила "Клубна къща", голяма сграда, която обслужвала много цели. В допълнение към настаняването, тя е първата образователна сграда на общността и съдържа добре заредена библиотека.<br/><br/>Строителството на жилищната част на Леклер започва веднага след основаването на селото през юни 1890 г. Юлиус Пицман, иновативният ландшафтен архитект, който изложил първите парцели в Леклер, ги създал с редица защитни завети. Споразуменията предвиждали широки, криволинейни улици, големи парцели и ограничение на нотариалния акт, което ограничавало имотите само до жилищни или образователни цели. Компанията павира улиците, осигурява електрическо улично осветление, монтира тротоари и засажда стотици дървета по улиците на Леклер. По-късни участъци от Льоклер са изложени с конвенционален дизайн на мрежата и по-малки партиди, но все пак включват ограниченията за нотариален акт.<br/><br/>Викторианска вила от Леклер през 1907 г.<br/>От Синди Райнхард<br/><br/>Първоначално жилищата са построени от компанията и след това продадени на близки разходи на служители на Нелсън, за да се насърчи собствеността на дома. Ако работник се разболее и не може да направи ипотеката си, плащанията са спрени, докато не се върне на работа. Домовете се предлагали в разнообразни дизайни на къщи и компанията рекламирала, че няма две еднакви жилища. Най-ранните домове били предимно викториански къщи, които идвали с електричество и течаща вода. Те са последвани от бунгала, четворки и дори някои жилища с комплекти. Жителите могат да закупят къща, построена от компанията, или да купят празен парцел и сами да построят къща, при условие, че архитектурният дизайн отговаря на фирмените стандарти.<br/><br/>В по-късните години много от тях са продадени на инвеститори, обикновено жители на Едуардсвил, а много домове през 20-те години са построени от местни предприемачи, които след това ги продават на жители на района.<br/><br/>Образование<br/><br/>Нелсън вярва в образованието за всички, включително и за работническата класа. Образователното програмиране започва с детска градина в Клубната къща през 1892 г. и продължава в новата образователна сграда на 722 Holyoake Road. Често наричана "Училищен дом", тази сграда осигурява голяма зала за срещи и програми, но има подвижни прегради, които да я разделят на класно пространство през деня. Вечерта имаше танци, срещи или програми на клуба за самокултурна култура Leclaire, който включваше седмични лекции на професори от Вашингтонския университет или национално известни лектори, които, подобно на Н. О. Нелсън, бяха част от движението за социално усъвършенстване в началото на века. Сред тях са Джейн Адамс, Едуард Евърет Хейл, Самюъл Джоунс от "Златното правило" и авторката Шарлот Пъркинс Гилман.<br/><br/>Деца, записани в детската градина в Леклер през 1913 г.<br/>От Синди Райнхард<br/><br/>През десетте години след построяването на образователната сграда през 1895 г. се провеждат серия от образователни експерименти, включващи индустриално училище, колеж, нощно училище и академия. Най-ранното и най-продължително начинание е сутрешната детска градина, основана през 1892 г., която използва модела на Фрьобел. Тази двугодишна програма е безплатна за всички, включително децата на Едуардсвил, до 1931 г., когато по финансови причини компанията започва да таксува обучение на студенти, които не са деца на служители. Nelson Manufacturing управлява детска градина до 1934 г., когато сградата е предадена на училищния район Едуардсвил срещу номинална такса.<br/><br/>Отдих<br/><br/>Лодки на езерото Леклер през 1915 г.<br/>От Синди Райнхард<br/><br/>Отдихът е важна характеристика на Леклер. Компанията осигурява спортни съоръжения за бейзбол, тенис, а по-късно и футбол. Построена е зала за боулинг и билярд и през зимата има езеро за лодки, плуване, риболов или пързаляне с кънки. Паркът Льоклер е бил обзаведен с къщички за лодки, мъжки и женски бани и голям павилион. Жителите организират танци, сено, правописни пчели и други дейности, а компанията спонсорира група, която свири редовно на забавления в селото или в Едуардсвил. Подобно на образователните функции в Клубната къща и Училищната къща, развлекателните съоръжения в Леклер са отворени за всички и често са били дестинация за Едуардсвил и дори за посетителите на Сейнт Луис.<br/><br/>Красота.<br/><br/>Ранна снимка на езерото Леклер<br/>От Синди Райнхард<br/><br/>Последният от факторите, които Нелсън счита за важни за задоволителен живот, се отнася до околната среда. Нелсън знаеше за важността на здравословния живот. Той ценял красотата и чистотата, които могат да бъдат намерени в страната, и насърчавал всички в Леклер да разкрасяват имота си, като засаждат градини и овощни градини. Самият Нелсън се ръководи от пример, така че една компания оранжерия предоставя безплатни цветя и се провеждат състезания за най-красивите дворове. Leclaire е поставен така, че цялото село има паркообразна обстановка, все още очевидна и днес.<br/><br/>Свобода<br/><br/>Кооперативен магазин Leclaire<br/>От Синди Райнхард<br/><br/>Нелсън изброява пет основополагащи принципа за Леклер, но съвременните писатели добавят шеста: Свобода. Всички програми, предлагани от компанията, са достъпни както за служителите, така и за местните жители, но нито една не е задължителна. Свободата да избираш дали да участваш в фирмените програми зависи изцяло от индивида. Жителите на Леклер могат да работят за Nelson Manufacturing или другаде, а работниците не са задължени да живеят в Леклер. Участието в развлекателни и образователни програми също е било по избор. Имало е и фирмен магазин, където служителите могат да пазаруват, но за разлика от други фирмени градове, никой не е имал дълг към фирмения магазин. Магазинът Leclaire е кооперация, в която членовете получават справедливи пазарни цени, но след това им се изплащат тримесечни дивиденти.<br/><br/>Различен фирмен град<br/><br/>Всички тези ползи правят Leclaire уникален от други градове на компанията, но има и отделни случаи, в които компанията показва състрадание и грижа за служителите. Компанията затваря фабриките и наема екскурзионни влакове, които да откарат работниците и техните семейства до Сейнт Луис за един ден на Световното изложение в Сейнт Луис през 1904 г. Когато парите били малко, Нелсън от време на време слагал допълнителни пари във всеки платен плик, за да улесни живота на работниците, и ако той създавал програма, с която мъжете не се съгласявали, те я разговаряли и, колкото пъти не, Нелсън се обръщал.<br/><br/>Роден в Лилесанд, Норвегия, през 1841 г., Н. О. Нелсън е сложен човек. Той е капиталист, който вярва в свободното предприемачество, но също така и социалист, последовател на "Златното правило", и патриот, който служи за Съюза в Гражданската война. До 1900 г. той е мултимилионер, но до смъртта си през 1922 г. е дал всичко за доброто на работническата класа.<br/><br/>Въпреки че Леклер не е единственият социален експеримент на Нелсън, той се счита за най-успешното му начинание. Други големи усилия за социално подобрение включват верига от кооперативни магазини за хранителни стоки в Ню Орлиънс, детска градина за децата на чернокожи служители в неговия Бесемер, Алабама, фабрики и дом за консуматори в Индио, Калифорния.<br/><br/>Селото на Нелсън в Леклер е известно в международен план като забележителен и успешен експеримент.

| Author Visits via Zoom or Skype<br/><br/>I'm excited to visit with your students via Zoom or Skype! Skype is a great option for schools/classes who aren't bringing in in-person authors, but who want to explore books and poetry, connect with an author, and ask one-on-one questions.<br/><br/>Cost<br/><br/>I offer 30-45-minute Zoom or Skype visits with schools for $125 per session (or $200 for two sessions happening within three hours in the morning or the afternoon; $325 for three sessions in one day; $425 for four sessions in one day). In each session, I try to get kids as actively involved as possible. No, it's not the same kind of connection as an in-person visit offers, but it can still be inspiring and motivating for kids!<br/><br/>What I Do<br/><br/>Each session for up to 50 students includes:<br/><br/>5 minutes of tech set-up<br/><br/>3 segments of 10ish-minutes each — You choose from:<br/><br/>How I became a writer<br/><br/>Writing this particular book (you choose which book I focus on)<br/><br/>Reading (I read some poems and kids help me read others)<br/><br/>Classroom presentation (your students put on a reading or performance for me—a very appreciative audience!)<br/><br/>Writing a poem together<br/><br/>Question and answer session<br/><br/>5 minutes of wrap-ups/goodbyes<br/><br/>I also chat with classes of pre-service teachers or groups of in-service teachers about poetry and writing.<br/><br/>Tips for a Great Virtual Visit<br/><br/>Tips for a Successful Virtual Visit<br/><br/>One of my goals for virtual school visits is to capture the interactivity that makes in-person visits successful and fun. But the truth is that sometimes it's tough to be virtually interactive! The timing might not sync up correctly, which makes reading together a challenge, and it's really hard for me to hear individual students unless they come up and speak directly into the microphone/computer. But after some trial and error, I've discovered some ways to have the best virtual visits possible. Here they are: 10 ways to make my visit with your students a great experience!<br/><br/>Before the Visit<br/><br/>Get kids as excited as possible about the visit. Visit my website with them. Read some of my books with them. Gather some questions students have for me. Anything you do ahead of time to make it feel like a BIG DEAL will go a long way toward student engagement.<br/><br/>Position the video camera or laptop with webcam so that I can see as much of the audience as possible. It's hard to assess student engagement when I can only see a couple of students.<br/><br/>Limit each group to 50 students. It's incredibly hard to engage large groups via video.<br/><br/>I'll move quickly from topic to topic or poem to poem. Please remind students that they'll need to listen closely to understand what's going on.<br/><br/>Occasionally, I do a little Reader's Theater with students. If I send you any scripted student parts ahead of time, print a copy for EACH session and cut into pieces, if needed.<br/><br/>During the Visit<br/><br/>When I discuss a book, if you have that printed book, please hold it up for students to see.<br/><br/>You are my proxy. I often can't call on students and hear individual replies. So, I might say, "We're going to get 3 ideas. Raise your hand if you have an idea." Then YOU take over, call on three students, and announce those answers to everyone in the room and to me.<br/><br/>Choose confident, outgoing students for scripted student parts (if I send any ahead of time). During my in-person school visits, I try to draw out some of the less confident students, but I've found that this doesn't work as well during virtual visits because I can't hear them.<br/><br/>Have students with speaking parts sit up front. When it's time, have them stand up and remind them to speak loudly.<br/><br/>In virtual visits, behavior management falls solely on you. I often can't see exactly what's going on, so do please step in as needed. If there's a big disruption, just ask me to hold on for a moment so that I don't chatter on while nobody's paying attention:>)<br/><br/>Feel free to take pictures of me on-screen and share on social media–even though pictures of me often look ridiculous because I'm making funny faces or something while I read!<br/><br/>If you have any questions at all, please just ask, either before or during the visit!<br/><br/>Scheduling a Virtual Session<br/><br/>Are you interested in scheduling a virtual visit with me? Just email me to set up a date, and we'll go from there | Авторски посещения чрез Zoom или Skype<br/><br/>Развълнуван съм да посетя с вашите ученици чрез Zoom или Skype! Skype е чудесна възможност за училища / класове, които не водят в лице автори, но които искат да изследват книги и поезия, да се свържат с автор, и да задават един-на-един въпроси.<br/><br/>Разходи<br/><br/>Предлагам 30-45-минутни Zoom или Skype посещения с училища за $ 125 на сесия (или $ 200 за две сесии, които се случват в рамките на три часа сутрин или следобед; $ 325 за три сесии в един ден; $ 425 за четири сесии в един ден). Във всяка сесия се опитвам да въвличам децата колкото се може по-активно. Не, това не е същия вид връзка като офертите за лично посещение, но все пак може да бъде вдъхновяващо и мотивиращо за децата!<br/><br/>Какво правя<br/><br/>Всяка сесия за до 50 студенти включва:<br/><br/>5 минути техническа настройка<br/><br/>3 сегмента от по 10 минути всеки – Вие избирате от:<br/><br/>Как станах писател<br/><br/>Писане на тази конкретна книга (ти избираш върху коя книга да се съсредоточа)<br/><br/>Четене (прочетох някои стихотворения и децата ми помагат да чета други)<br/><br/>Представяне в класната стая (вашите ученици поставят на четене или изпълнение за мен-много признателна аудитория!)<br/><br/>Писане на поема заедно<br/><br/>Сесия за въпроси и отговори<br/><br/>5 минути превръзки/довиждане<br/><br/>Също така разговарям с класове от учители преди службата или групи от учители по време на службата за поезия и писане.<br/><br/>Съвети за страхотно виртуално посещение<br/><br/>Съвети за успешно виртуално посещение<br/><br/>Една от целите ми за виртуални посещения в училище е да уловя интерактивността, която прави личните посещения успешни и забавни. Но истината е, че понякога е трудно да бъдеш практически интерактивен! Времето може да не се синхронизира правилно, което прави четенето заедно предизвикателство и наистина ми е трудно да чуя отделни ученици, освен ако не излязат и не говорят директно в микрофона / компютъра. Но след някои опити и грешки, открих някои начини да имам възможно най-добрите виртуални посещения. Ето ги: 10 начина да направите посещението ми с вашите ученици страхотно преживяване!<br/><br/>Преди посещението<br/><br/>Вземете децата колкото е възможно по-развълнувани за посещението. Посетете моя уебсайт с тях. Прочетете някои от книгите ми с тях. Съберете някои въпроси, които учениците имат за мен. Всичко, което направите предварително, за да го почувствате като BIG DEAL, ще извърви дълъг път към ангажираността на студентите.<br/><br/>Позиционирайте видеокамерата или лаптопа с уеб камера, така че да мога да виждам колкото се може повече от аудиторията. Трудно е да се оцени ангажираността на учениците, когато мога да видя само няколко студенти.<br/><br/>Ограничете всяка група до 50 ученика. Невероятно трудно е да ангажирате големи групи чрез видео.<br/><br/>Ще се преместя бързо от тема на тема или стихотворение на стихотворение. Моля, напомнете на учениците, че ще трябва да слушат внимателно, за да разберат какво се случва.<br/><br/>Понякога правя малък читателски театър със студенти. Ако ви изпратя предварително написани студентски части, отпечатайте копие за всяка сесия и нарязани на парчета, ако е необходимо.<br/><br/>По време на посещението<br/><br/>Когато обсъждам книга, ако имате тази печатна книга, моля, задръжте я, за да я видят учениците.<br/><br/>Ти си моят пълномощник. Често не мога да се обадя на учениците и да чуя индивидуални отговори. Така че, може да кажа: "Ще получим 3 идеи. Вдигнете ръка, ако имате идея." Тогава ВИЕ поемате, обаждате се на трима ученици и съобщавате тези отговори на всички в стаята и на мен.<br/><br/>Изберете уверени, изходящи студенти за скриптирани студентски части (ако изпратя предварително). По време на посещенията си в училище се опитвам да привлека някои от по-неуверените ученици, но открих, че това не работи добре по време на виртуални посещения, защото не мога да ги чуя.<br/><br/>Накарайте учениците с говорни части да седнат отпред. Когато дойде време, накарайте ги да се изправят и да им напомнят да говорят силно.<br/><br/>При виртуалните посещения управлението на поведението пада единствено върху вас. Често не мога да видя точно какво се случва, така че моля, пристъпете, ако е необходимо. Ако има голямо смущение, просто ме помолете да се държа за момент, така че да не бърборя, докато никой не обръща внимание:>)<br/><br/>Чувствайте се свободни да правите снимки на мен на екрана и да споделяте в социалните медии - въпреки че снимките ми често изглеждат смешни, защото правя смешни лица или нещо подобно, докато чета!<br/><br/>Ако имате някакви въпроси, моля, просто попитайте, преди или по време на посещението!<br/><br/>Планиране на виртуална сесия<br/><br/>Интересувате ли се от насрочване на виртуално посещение с мен? Просто ми пишете, за да насрочим дата, и ние ще отидем от там |

On the one hand it has prompted stigma and violence and on the other it has brought about constructive and supportive responses from various individuals and groups. A new book, Acting on HIV, edited by Prof. Dennis Francis, Dean of the Faculty of Education at the University of the Free State, looks at how drama can be used to promote vital social change as well as individual behavioural change.<br/><br/>Acting on HIV offers a systematic inquiry into drama as an approach to discuss HIV/AIDS and related attitudes and behaviours. The book is a scholarly text and includes the work of some twenty exceptionally creative authors. Contributing authors to the book include, amongst others, Proff. Hazel Barnes (University of the Witwatersrand), Rob Pattman (Stellenbosch University) and Yvonne Sliep from the University of KwaZulu-Natal.<br/><br/>"This project started in 2009 and has taken much of my time to bring together the work of exceptionally creative authors. The research that is communicated through the book is original and timely and makes a significant contribution to conversations about the role/s and significance of drama in addressing issues of HIV & AIDS," says Prof. Francis | Архив на новините<br/><br/>Нова книга разглежда начините за справяне с ХИВ-предизвикателства<br/><br/>2011-11-29 г.<br/><br/>Проф. Денис Франсис с Марджъри Хюман, която проектира корицата на книгата, Действайки върху ХИВ.<br/><br/>Пандемията от ХИВ извади наяве най-доброто и най-лошото при хората по отношение на отговора. От една страна тя предизвика стигма и насилие, а от друга доведе до конструктивни и подкрепящи реакции от различни индивиди и групи. Една нова книга, Acting on HIV, редактирана от проф. Денис Франсис, декан на Факултета по образование в Университета на Свободната държава, разглежда как драмата може да се използва за насърчаване на жизненоважна социална промяна, както и на индивидуалната поведенческа промяна.<br/><br/>Актьорството върху ХИВ предлага систематично изследване на драмата като подход за обсъждане на ХИВ/СПИН и свързаните с него нагласи и поведения. Книгата е научен текст и включва работата на около двадесет изключително креативни автори. Допринасящите автори към книгата включват, наред с другото, проф. Хейзъл Барнс (Университет на Витватерсранд), Роб Патман (Университет Стелленбош) и Ивон Слийп от Университета в Квазулу-Натал.<br/><br/>"Този проект започна през 2009 г. и отдели голяма част от времето ми, за да събере на едно място работата на изключително креативни автори. Изследването, което се съобщава чрез книгата, е оригинално и навременно и има значителен принос към разговорите за ролята/ите и значението на драмата при решаването на проблемите на ХИВ и СПИН", казва проф. |
| Transcript of Testing the Effect of Ghost Traps on the Blue Crab, Callinectis Sapidus , in Barnegat Bay<br/><br/>Michael FranklinMarine Field Methods16 September 2008<br/><br/>I chose to use the Blue crab, Callinectus sapidus, for my experiment because it is abundant here in Barnegat Bay and it is relatively easy to catch.<br/><br/>Callinectes sapidus is a swimming crab Important to commercial soft-shell crabbers, both commercial and recreational (Jivoff 2008)Main method of crabbing is basic crab trap<br/><br/>Ghost traps occur when a trap is lost yet continues to catch organisms (Breen 1990)John Wnek says there are easily 2,000 in Barnegat BaySince C. sapidus is so aggressive (Pollock 1998) , what happens when they get stuck in cage with no food and what impact does this have?<br/><br/>If caught in a ghost trap, C. sapidus will have cannibalistic tendencies until the last one has died off from starvation.<br/><br/>How do we duplicate a ghost trap in the lab?Create ghost trap by closing of entrances with wire mesh and zip tiesOnce specimen are loaded, close off top with zip ties<br/><br/>Crab entrance closed off with wire mesh<br/><br/>Crab TrapWire MeshWire CuttersRopeCameraZip Ties<br/><br/>How do we get crabs?Trap some a few days early and starve themOnce ready to begin, collect new crabs from trapsAdd directly to ghost trap with 2 from starved tank<br/><br/>Six crabs total, one missingFound small space to escape due; patched up with zip tieTwo crabs deadOne just has claws leftOther missing both paddles and one claw<br/><br/>Four crabs alive and intactLarger dead crab has no changeSmaller dead crab has only section of carapice left<br/><br/>Last day of experimentTook two samplesNo change from second day in first sampleSecond observation, larger carapice separated from rest of body/claw<br/><br/>Based on the results, I reject my null hypothesis that the crabs will simply be in the trap. The results show that they cannibalized two crabs in the trap, then, at least for the duration of my test, were satiated.<br/><br/>Ghost traps do affect the organisms stuck in them, namely C. sapidus.C. sapidus has no problem resorting to cannibalism when no other food source is available.Cannot extrapolate my data over whole bay. | Transcript of Testing the Effect of Ghost Traps on the Blue Crab, Калинектис Сапидус, в залива Барнегат<br/><br/>Michael FranklinMarine Field Methods16 септември 2008 г.<br/><br/>Избрах да използвам Синия рак, Callinectus sapidus, за моя експеримент, защото е в изобилие тук в залива Барнегат и е сравнително лесно да се хване.<br/><br/>Callinectes sapidus е плуващ рак Важно за търговските мекочерупчести раци, както търговски, така и развлекателни (Jivoff 2008) Основен метод за раци е основен капан за раци<br/><br/>Призрачни капани се появяват, когато капан е изгубен, но продължава да улавя организми (Breen 1990)Джон Унек казва, че лесно има 2000 в залива БарнегатТъй като C. sapidus е толкова агресивен (Pollock 1998) , какво се случва, когато те се забиват в клетка без храна и какво въздействие има това?<br/><br/>Ако бъде хванат в призрачен капан, C. sapidus ще има канибалски наклонности, докато последният не умре от глад.<br/><br/>Как да дублираме призрачен капан в лабораторията?Създаване на призрачен капан чрез затваряне на входове с телена мрежа и пощенски връзкиСлед като образецът се зарежда, затворете върха с пощенски връзки<br/><br/>Входът на раци е затворен с телена мрежа<br/><br/>Резачки за раци за капаниRopeCameraZip Ties<br/><br/>Как да получим раци?Хвани някои няколко дни по-рано и ги гладуватСлед като са готови да започнат, съберете нови раци от капаниДобавете директно към капана за призраци с 2 от гладуващ резервоар<br/><br/>Шест раци общо, един липсваНамерено малко пространство, за да избяга дължи; закърпени с цип вратовръзкаДва раци мъртъвЕдин просто има останали ноктиДруги липсващи и двете гребла и един нокът<br/><br/>Четири раци живи и непокътнатиПо-голям мъртъв раци няма промянаПо-малък мъртъв раци има само част от карапис ляво<br/><br/>Последен ден на експериментаВземете две пробиНяма промяна от втория ден в първата пробаВторо наблюдение, по-голям карапис, отделен от останалата част на тялото/нокътя<br/><br/>Въз основа на резултатите отхвърлям нулевата си хипотеза, че раци просто ще бъдат в капана.

| Storyworld Spotlight<br/><br/>25 years of Tomb Raider<br/><br/>Tomb Raider is one of the most recognizable entertainment properties in the world. Since Lara Croft's first videogame appearance in Tomb Raider (1996), her exploits as an adventurous and quick-witted explorer have resonated widely with players, earning her a place in the pantheon of great pop culture characters. For that reason we will be putting The World of Lara Croft in the Storyworld Spotlight from December 22, 2021 to March 6, 2022.<br/><br/>Crafting a Croft<br/><br/>Lara Croft was created by studio Core Design, in Derby (UK), in 1996. The studio was looking for a lead character for their upcoming a 3D adventure game for PlayStation 1. A game in a 3rd person perspective where players would see the main character in full throughout every scene.<br/><br/>As the game was about 'raiding mysterious tombs deep under pyramids,' the lead character would need to look adventurous, and have the brains to survive complex raiding missions. After some deliberation, Lara Croft was born, a young, upper-class and utterly British woman, who was as enigmatic and intelligent as she was tough and self-reliant.<br/><br/>Success and controversy<br/><br/>Tomb Raider (1996) was a breakaway success for Core Design, who quickly doubled down on building Tomb Raider 2 (1997) and 3 (1998). A big part of the success was attributed to the games' leading lady, who found admirers both with male and female players. This baffled critics who just saw Lara Croft as a sexist cartoon.<br/><br/>Explore The World of Lara Croft in Storyworld<br/><br/>This exhibition explores the successful franchise in-depth. It looks at the history of the games and why its leading lady resonates with so many people. It also dives into the mystery of what makes Tomb Raider games tick, from the deep world building to the clever puzzles and traps, and from fantastic enemy and monster designs to the character design of the legendary heroine.<br/><br/>After all, mysteries are there to explore, and have been for the past 25 years.<br/><br/>Tickets<br/><br/>Buy your tickets for Storyworld online with a start date and entry time from Wednesday December 22.

От първата поява на Лара Крофт в Tomb Raider (1996), нейните подвизи като авантюристичен и бърз изследовател са резонирали широко с играчите, спечелвайки й място в пантеона на великите герои от поп културата. По тази причина ще поставим The World of Lara Croft в Storyworld Spotlight от 22 декември 2021 г. до 6 март 2022 г.<br/><br/>Изработване на Крофт<br/><br/>Лара Крофт е създадена от студио Core Design, в Дерби (Великобритания), през 1996 г. Студиото търси главен герой за тяхната предстояща 3D приключенска игра за PlayStation 1. Игра в перспектива от трето лице, където играчите ще виждат главния герой в пълен размер през всяка сцена.<br/><br/>Тъй като играта е за "нападение на мистериозни гробници дълбоко под пирамидите", главният герой ще трябва да изглежда приключенски и да има мозъци, за да оцелее при сложни мисии. След известно обмисляне се ражда Лара Крофт, млада, висша класа и напълно британка, която е толкова загадъчна и интелигентна, колкото и твърда и самоуверена.<br/><br/>Успех и противоречия<br/><br/>Tomb Raider (1996) е пробивен успех за Core Design, който бързо се удвоява при изграждането на Tomb Raider 2 (1997) и 3 (1998). Голяма част от успеха се приписва на водещата дама на игрите, която намира почитатели както с мъжки, така и с женски играчи. Това озадачи критиците, които току-що видяха Лара Крофт като сексистки анимационен филм.<br/><br/>Разгледайте света на Лара Крофт в Storyworld<br/><br/>Тази изложба изследва успешния франчайзинг в дълбочина. Тя разглежда историята на игрите и защо нейната водеща дама резонира с толкова много хора. Той също така се гмурка в мистерията на това, което прави Tomb Raider игри кърлежи, от изграждането на дълбокия свят на умни пъзели и капани, и от фантастични враг и чудовище дизайни до дизайна на героя на легендарната героиня.<br/><br/>В края на краищата, мистериите са там, за да се изследват и са били през последните 25 години.<br/><br/>Билети<br/><br/>Закупете билетите си за Storyworld онлайн с начална дата и време за влизане от сряда 22 декември.

| Real Estate Word of the Day: Option<br/><br/>Option: An agreement to keep open, for a set period, an offer to sell or lease real property. An option can be used, for example, to give the buyer time to resolve questions of financing, title, zoning and feasibility before committing the buyer to purchase. Options are frequently used in the land assemblage process. The option must be supported by its actual consideration, separate and independent of the purchase price of the property. Mere recital of consideration alone is not sufficient except in a lease-option in which the provisions of the lease are themselves sufficient consideration to support the option. An option merely creates a contractual right; it does not give the optionee any estate in the property. At the time the option is signed, the owner does not sell, nor does the buyer purchase, the property. Although the owner is obligated to sell if given notice by the buyer, the buyer is not obligated to purchase. An option to buy is also known as a call; an option to sell is known as a put. | Недвижим имот Дума на деня: Вариант<br/><br/>Опция: Споразумение за запазване на отворен, за определен период, оферта за продажба или отдаване под наем на недвижими имоти. Една опция може да се използва, например, за да се даде време на купувача да разреши въпросите за финансиране, заглавие, зониране и осъществимост, преди да се ангажира купувачът да закупи. Опциите често се използват в процеса на сглобяване на земята. Опцията трябва да бъде подкрепена от нейното действително възнаграждение, отделно и независимо от покупната цена на имота. Само съображение на съображение не е достатъчно, освен при опция за лизинг, при която самите разпоредби на лизинга са достатъчно възнаграждение, за да подкрепят опцията.

| Benefits of Carotenoids for the Skin<br/><br/>Have you heard of carotenoids? These powerful phytochemicals are the pigmented constituents found in plants that give flowers, fruits, and leaves their yellow, orange and red colours.<br/><br/>Since the 1930s, scientists have identified about 800 carotenoids and about 40 are found in the human body, including the outermost layer of the epidermis, the dermis and subcutaneous fat. The most common carotenoids are beta-carotene, alpha-carotene, lutein, zeaxanthin, lycopene, and astaxanthin. You can read more about astaxanthin here.<br/><br/>The content of carotenoids in the skin is influenced by numerous factors, including the intake of fruits and vegetables, their bioavailability from various foods, supplementation, exposure to UV radiation, air pollution, alcohol consumption, smoking and stress.<br/><br/>How do Carotenoids Help My Skin?<br/><br/>Carotenoids are some of the best-known antioxidants for the skin and they also have important functions as anti-inflammatory agents.<br/><br/>Healthy Aging and Skin Repair<br/><br/>Antioxidants are essential for healthy skin because they help to prevent free radical damage to cells. Free radical damage causes premature aging and the onset of various types of skin cancers. Carotenoids, along with vitamin E, vitamin C, and Co enzyme Q10 are important dermal antioxidants.<br/><br/>Due to their antioxidant activity, carotenoids support and encourage collagen and elastin production in the skin. This helps to increase the skin's density, thickness, elasticity, and firmness. Collagen and elastin decrease as we age, so getting enough carotenoids in the diet and topically is critical for aging well.<br/><br/>Carotenoids can improve the signs of photoaging, skin discolouration, elasticity, hydration, texture, and can reduce transepidermal water loss.<br/><br/>Astaxanthin in particular stimulates fibroblasts to produce collagen and elastin, inhibits the activity of the enzymes that breakdown collagen and elastin, and shows anti-inflammatory and UV-filtering effects. It has been shown to reduce melanin in the skin, which results in the decrease in the appearance of freckles and melasma.<br/><br/>Anti-acne activity: the anti-inflammatory activity of carotenoids helps to dampen the inflammation and irritation associated with acne. Carotenoids also help to normalize and balance oil secretions from the sebaceous glands. They are valuable agents in skin repair and they stimulate epidermal regeneration, helping to smooth and soften skin.<br/><br/>Where Can I Find Carotenoids?<br/><br/>There are two ways to get your daily dose of carotenoids: through diet and through topical application. The combination of both is the ideal approach to well-aging skincare.<br/><br/>Carotenoids are fat-soluble, so your body needs fat to absorb them (think tomatoes and olive oil, broccoli and butter, or spinach and avocado). Common sources of carotenoids in food are avocado, egg yolks, kale, spinach, carrots, sweet potatoes, papaya, and tomatoes.<br/><br/>While we advocate getting as many of your nutrients and antioxidants as you can from food rather than supplementation; one study showed that astaxanthin combined with collagen hydrolysate significantly improved barrier integrity, reduced transepidermal water loss, and increased the expression of procollagen type I mRNA.<br/><br/>Topical application is key to healthy skin. Studies show that high concentrations of antioxidants in human skin offer the best protection for healthy skin at any age.<br/><br/>At Sarka Botanicals, we blend carotenoid-rich, whole plants such as calendula, dandelion, and extracts like astaxanthin with cold-pressed oils and functional ingredients. Calendula alone contains over 19 different types of carotenoids. This may explain why it has such a long history of use in skin care. Studies show that carotenoids blended with co-enzyme Q10 are especially effective at reducing inflammation and slowing premature skin aging due to sun exposure. | Предимства на каротеноиди за кожата<br/><br/>Чували ли сте за каротеноиди? Тези мощни фитохимикали са пигментираните съставки, открити в растенията, които дават цветя, плодове и оставят своите жълти, оранжеви и червени цветове.<br/><br/>От 30-те години на миналия век учените са идентифицирали около 800 каротеноиди и около 40 се намират в човешкото тяло, включително най-външния слой на епидермиса, дермата и подкожната мазнина. Най-често срещаните каротеноиди са бета-каротин, алфа-каротин, лутеин, зеаксантин, ликопен и астаксантин. Можете да прочетете повече за астаксантин тук.<br/><br/>Съдържанието на каротеноиди в кожата се влияе от множество фактори, включително приема на плодове и зеленчуци, тяхната бионаличност от различни храни, добавки, излагане на UV радиация, замърсяване на въздуха, консумация на алкохол, тютюнопушене и стрес.<br/><br/>Как каротеноидите помагат на кожата ми?<br/><br/>Каротеноидите са едни от най-известните антиоксиданти за кожата и те също имат важни функции като противовъзпалителни средства.<br/><br/>Здравословно стареене и възстановяване на кожата<br/><br/>Антиоксидантите са от съществено значение за здравата кожа, защото те помагат да се предотврати увреждането на свободните радикали на клетките. свободните радикали причиняват преждевременно стареене и появата на различни видове рак на кожата. Каротеноидите, заедно с витамин Е, витамин С и коензим Q10 са важни дермални антиоксиданти.<br/><br/>Благодарение на антиоксидантната си активност, каротеноидите подпомагат и насърчават производството на колаген и еластин в кожата. Това спомага за увеличаване на плътността, дебелината, еластичността и твърдостта на кожата. Колагенът и еластинът намаляват с възрастта, така че получаването на достатъчно каротеноиди в диетата и локално е от решаващо значение за стареенето.<br/><br/>Каротеноидите могат да подобрят признаците на фотостареене, обезцветяване на кожата, еластичност, хидратация, текстура и могат да намалят трансепидермалната загуба на вода.<br/><br/>Астаксантинът по-специално стимулира фибробластите да произвеждат колаген и еластин, инхибира активността на ензимите, които разграждат колагена и еластин, и показва противовъзпалителни и UV-филтриращи ефекти. Доказано е, че намалява меланина в кожата, което води до намаляване на появата на лунички и мелазма.<br/><br/>Антиакне активност: противовъзпалителното действие на каротеноиди помага за намаляване на възпалението и дразненето, свързани с акне. Каротеноидите също помагат за нормализиране и балансиране на маслените секрети от мастните жлези. Те са ценни агенти при възстановяването на кожата и стимулират епидермалната регенерация, спомагайки за изглаждане и омекотяване на кожата.<br/><br/>Къде мога да намеря каротеноиди?<br/><br/>Има два начина да получите дневната си доза каротеноиди: чрез диета и чрез локално приложение. Комбинацията от двете е идеалният подход за добре застаряваща грижа за кожата.<br/><br/>Каротеноидите са мастноразтворими, така че тялото ви се нуждае от мазнини, за да ги абсорбира (мисли домати и зехтин, броколи и масло, или спанак и авокадо). Общи източници на каротеноиди в храната са авокадо, яйчни жълтъци, зеле, спанак, моркови, сладки картофи, папая и домати.<br/><br/>Докато ние се застъпваме за получаване на колкото се може повече от вашите хранителни вещества и антиоксиданти, колкото можете от храната, а не от добавките; едно проучване показа, че астаксантинът, комбиниран с колагенов хидролизат, значително подобрява целостта на бариерата, намалява трансепидермалната загуба на вода и увеличава експресията на проколаген тип I иРНК.<br/><br/>Локалното приложение е от ключово значение за здравата кожа. Проучванията показват, че високите концентрации на антиоксиданти в човешката кожа предлагат най-добрата защита за здрава кожа във всяка възраст.<br/><br/>В Sarka Botanicals смесваме богати на каротеноиди цели растения като невен, глухарче и екстракти като астаксантин със студено пресовани масла и функционални съставки. Само невенът съдържа над 19 различни вида каротеноиди. Това може да обясни защо има толкова дълга история на употреба в грижата за кожата. Проучванията показват, че каротеноиди, смесени с коензим Q10, са особено ефективни за намаляване на възпалението и забавяне на преждевременното стареене на кожата поради излагане на слънце. |
