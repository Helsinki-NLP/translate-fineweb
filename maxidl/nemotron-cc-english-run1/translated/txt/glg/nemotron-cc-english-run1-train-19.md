| Quidditch through the ages<br/><br/>I was doodling some quidditch-related objects like broomsticks and snitches and whatnot and it sort of turned into this odd compilation of things, including Harry down there at the bottom. I am not completely satisfied with the way it came out, but since it's not bad for my second Harry Potter fan-art picture, I decided to color it anyway. If you are wondering where his scar is, it's there, but it's very very light and small because I did that bit on the computer. Sketched in pen, colored in Paint. | Quidditch a través das idades<br/><br/>Eu estaba a barallar algúns obxectos relacionados co quidditch como varras e aguillóns e o que sexa e iso converteuse nunha especie de compilación estraña de cousas, incluíndo a Harry alí na parte inferior. Non estou completamente satisfeito coa forma en que saíu, pero como non está mal para a miña segunda imaxe de fan-arte de Harry Potter, decidín coloreala de todos os xeitos. Se vos estades a preguntar onde está a súa cicatriz, está alí, pero é moi, moi lixeira e pequena porque fixen esa peza no ordenador. Esbozada en lápiz, coloreada en pintura. |
| I just started saltwater fly fishing this summer and I need a new reel, so it'll definitely be the Kraken. (I'm in Florida; we don't have those little trout minnow things around here. ) Private Message on the way to you.<br/><br/>I'm thrilled and flattered. I'm also trying to figure out a way to explain to She-Who-Must-Be-Obeyed that I'll need to buy a new rod worthy of this reel.....<br/><br/>I've always found that no explanation is the best explanation. Don't give her a reason to ever say you're not spontaneous enough. | Acabo de comezar a pescar moscas de auga salgada este verán e necesito un novo carrete, así que definitivamente será o Kraken. (Estou en Florida; non temos esas pequenas cousas de troita minnow por aquí. ) Mensaxe privada de camiño a vostede.<br/><br/>Estou emocionado e halagado. Tamén estou tentando atopar unha forma de explicar a Ela-Quen-Debe-Ser-Obedecido que terei que mercar unha nova vara digna deste carrete.....<br/><br/>Sempre atopei que ningunha explicación é a mellor explicación, non lle deas unha razón para nunca dicir que non es espontánea abondo. |
| If you were admitted and enrolled --> yes If you were admitted and attended another school --> yes If you took extension courses (do they even have them there? I know UCLA does) --> yes If you went to graduate school there --> yes<br/><br/>That's my interpretation because any of these scenarios would fulfill either being "admitted to an undergraduate program" or "taking courses" at UC Berkeley. I could be completely wrong though, you're better off just calling them and clarifying your specific situation.<br/><br/>My opinion: Based on the wording, I interpreted it as asking if you were admitted to Berkeley undergrad, whether or not you chose to attend. If it meant admitted and attended, they could easily have seen that through the "Undergrad Institutions" portion of the application. | Se foi admitido e matriculado --> si Se foi admitido e asistiu a outra escola --> si Se tomou cursos de extensión (aínda os teñen alí? Sei que UCLA fai) --> si Se foi a escola de posgrao alí --> si<br/><br/>Esa é a miña interpretación porque calquera destes escenarios cumpriría ser "admitido nun programa de pregrado" ou "tomar cursos" na UC Berkeley. Podería estar completamente equivocado, pero é mellor que os chame e aclare a súa situación específica.<br/><br/>A miña opinión: Basándome na redacción, interpreteino como preguntar se foi admitido na licenciatura de Berkeley, se elixiu ou non asistir. Se significaba admitido e asistido, poderían facilmente ter visto que a través da parte "Institucións de Grao" da solicitude. |
| ...........A lot of the time head bolts are angle tightened so you set them at say 20Nm for a starting point then angle tighten them from there.<br/><br/>.....I would have preferred a bigger hammer<br/><br/>Cheers.<br/><br/>You can never have too big a hammer<br/><br/>I'll confess.<br/>There must be a fine distinction between torque setting with a Click torque wrench and angle setting but even as an engineer, I don't really understand it.<br/><br/>To me, if you tighten a bolt you get to a point when it locks. And as TTT says at a relatively low torque. After that, further tightening both increases the torque load and the head angle ??<br/><br/>To me it's a distinction between measurement techniques rather then final result. If anyone can explain why one instead of the other I'd be greatful ??<br/><br/>I'm sure other old farts will remember old style torque wrenches with the separate pointer that swung around a graduated scale as you put load on them.<br/>Graduated in Ft Lbs, measurement in angle.<br/>Aren't these just a variation on the theme ?? | Moitas veces os parafusos de cabeza son axustados en ángulo, polo que os estableces en digamos 20Nm para un punto de partida e logo axustámolos desde alí.<br/><br/>Prefiro un martelo máis grande.<br/><br/>Saúdos.<br/><br/>Nunca podes ter un martelo tan grande<br/><br/>Confesareino.<br/>Debe haber unha boa distinción entre o axuste de torque cunha chave de torque Click e o axuste de ángulo, pero mesmo como enxeñeiro, realmente non o entendo.<br/><br/>Para min, se apertas un parafuso, chegas a un punto no que se bloquea. E como di TTT a un par de torsión relativamente baixo.

| Winter Protection for Fig Trees<br/><br/>Report This Article<br/><br/>Winter Protection for Fig Trees<br/><br/>Overview<br/><br/>The fig tree has been around since at least 5,000 B.C., and is grown throughout the world for its delicious fruit. Figs grow well in a mild climate without weather extremes. The fig tree is now propagated in some areas with harsh winters. Protective precautions are required to save the tree from winter damage.<br/><br/>Potted Fig Trees<br/><br/>Ornamental fig trees in pots can stand some freezing and do not require light once they enter the winter dormancy phase. Avoid extreme swings in temperature by placing the fig tree in a controlled environment such as a garage, where temperatures range between slightly under freezing and slight above. The plant should be watered as the soil dries.<br/><br/>Shielding<br/><br/>Shielding to protect the tree from the most extreme winter weather is required. Fig trees require placement in soil areas where the soil does not freeze to protect it from disease and increase its chances of winter survival. Large screens placed around the tree protects it from winter winds that can damage and freeze the wood.<br/><br/>Wrapping<br/><br/>Tree wrapping protects the tree from cold weather and prevents hard winds from destroying the branches. Fig tree wrapping should be applied once the leaves from the tree have fallen to prevent leaves from rotting inside the wrapping material. Fig trees are sensitive to slight temperature changes. It can not warm up inside the protective film or else the tree may begin to grow, making it susceptible to severe damage during the cold snap.<br/><br/>Planting<br/><br/>Cultivar practices help to protect the fig tree during harsh winters. Varieties that are resistant to cold weather are best for locations where the weathers are harsh. Brown Turkey, Brunswick and Blue Celeste are good cultivars for cold weather. Planting should be done against a wall or structure that will radiate heat towards the tree during the winter months.<br/><br/>Snow<br/><br/>Roots of the fig tree require dry soil during the winter dormancy period. Watering should be done only when the soil is dry and the roots should be protected from melting snow and rain. Protection placed on the ground under the tree, near the trunk--to keep water from draining into the soil--protects the tree from damage.<br/><br/>Keywords:<br/>fig tree protection, fig tree winter, fig tree care | Protección de inverno para as árbores<br/><br/>Informar deste artigo<br/><br/>Protección de inverno para as árbores<br/><br/>Vista xeral<br/><br/>A figueira estivo ao redor desde polo menos 5.000 a.C., e crece en todo o mundo polas súas deliciosas froitas.

| Oculus CEO comes down hard on Mac support for the Rift<br/><br/>Oculus CEO, Palmer Luckey, has not minced his words when asked in an interview whether the Rift VR headset will ever support the Mac. If you had any hopes of it being soon, you might want to ready yourselves for some disappointment.<br/><br/>That is up to Apple. If they ever release a good computer, we will do it.<br/><br/>What he's referring to there in a less diplomatic sense is the discrete graphics required to run the Rift. The simple truth is that Apple just doesn't go for high-end graphics that will meet the requirements for the headset. For context, on a Windows PC, you need a minimum of an NVIDIA GTX 970, a $300 graphics card.<br/><br/>As Luckey went on to say:<br/><br/>It just boils down to the fact that Apple doesn't prioritize high-end GPUs. You can buy a $6,000 Mac Pro with the top of the line AMD FirePro D700, and it still doesn't match our recommended specs. So if they prioritize higher-end GPUs like they used to for a while back in the day, we'd love to support Mac. But right now, there's just not a single machine out there that supports it.<br/><br/>The Mac Pro can't be accused of not packing plenty of horsepower, because it does, but equally FirePro graphics are targeted more towards the creative market, just like the Mac Pro. The Mac Pro in particular far exceeds other hardware requirements, but naturally as the Rift is graphics heavy, this is where the shortfall is. Luckey is perhaps being a little over the top, but equally he's the man behind the Rift, so there's no doubts plenty of truth to what he says. Even if he doesn't say it particularly well.<br/><br/>What say you, Mac owners of the world? Are you even bothered about the Oculus Rift or is it something you wish you could have? Sound off in the comments below!<br/><br/>Reader comments<br/><br/>Oculus CEO comes down hard on Mac support for the Rift<br/><br/>No, not bothered by it since I really wasn't planning on buying an Oculus Rift. For me the product category is still too early and too much in a beta-kinda phase. But he does rise a valid point. Apple should try to get more ahead of the pack CPU/GPU wise. Right now they're always trailing behind.<br/><br/>Excuse me, but what is HTC Vive better at? And Oculus Rift most certainly supports Linux machines that meet their hardware specifications! (The issue is not OS but hardware.)<br/><br/>Also, look at WHY the HTC Vive supports OS X: it includes more of its own hardware. (Which is why it costs so much.) The Oculus solutions - both the Rift and the Samsung Gear VR - require the hardware that it is plugging into to perform more of the heavy lifting.<br/><br/>VR isn't a gimmick. 3D TVs don't always give that much of a 3d effect, and it doesn't work with everyone. VR works with everyone, and the Oculus and HTC Vive official release products have almost no latency so there shoudn't be any motion sickness. There's also plenty of game support<br/><br/>Obviously if gaming is a priority you're generally not in the market for a Mac, though. Not many game developers support OSX so these types of devices likely have limited use on a Mac (for gaming, anyways, which the Rift was designed for). At least that's the only reason I could see myself using one. I definitely wouldn't use it for watching movies.<br/><br/>Apple did implement the Metal engine into El Capitan, there might be some plan to go into the gaming market (as Apple learned from iOS how big this market is, just look at the top grossing apps).<br/>So now the hardware is missing and and game devs would probably show some interest, since Macs there are now an acceptable amount of Mac users around the world.<br/><br/>I would like to see Apple make its way into that sector of the industry. I don't use any Apple products presently but they're making a lot of the right moves in many areas and I'm very intrigued.<br/><br/>Plus, competition fuels innovation. I know that major computer part manufactures already create that competition but Apple has the RnD willpower and the cash to really turn heads. They may not win the numbers games in terms of specs, they actually rarely do, but most people who care to do the research know that performance != the sum of the device's parts. Apple can do more with "less". On paper their products appear inferior but when carefully balanced hardware meets specifically engineered software they generally perform just as well as the competition if not out perform.<br/><br/>HA! I love how, all of a sudden, having a high performance computer is not important to Apple phans! There is not a single Mac capable of the highest end graphics. Can't buy one, can't build one. Mac is not capable of being the highest in performance and you are good with that. HA! Classic!<br/><br/>I bought my MacBook Pro Retina in 2012 because of the high resolution screen and the non-discrete GPU. However, for my desktop I built a system with a 4K monitor, i7 4790K CPU, 3 GTX 970 GPU's, and 16 gb of memory all for less than what I'd pay for an iMac. I even have an SSD set up to boot in OSX. My point is Apple could do similar things if it wished, but doesn't. In fact, look at the most recent iMac. It includes discrete graphics and a slow 5400 RPM drive. My computer may not look as pretty, and it's not as thin, but in the end it's more useful - isn't that why we buy a computer in the first place?<br/><br/>I don't see why a Mac pro can not make use of the Oculus isn't it built for rendering video. I understand that it will not be able to run on iMac's and because of this the Oculus should be branded for Pro users due to the requirements and come at the price.<br/><br/>Now people are saying that your computer is doing ALL the heavy lifting, so why is the price point over $800 for something that isn't doing anything?<br/><br/>I'm excited about the direction of VR but not where it is at the moment.<br/><br/>Your display (which the Rift is) never does any of the heavy lifting. It's $800 because of what the display does; 110° viewing angle (still not human eye but much closer than other displays) with super low latency to reduce or eliminate motion sickness on a 1200x1800 per eye display for HD quality.<br/><br/>And yes, Mac's are very widely used for video rendering, but that rendering doesn't happen at 30+fps. It can take video rendering machines hours to render a single frame and sometimes years to render an entire movie. The final products, or pre-rendered material, is what then becomes 30+fps.<br/><br/>Thank you @TheRealFixxer<br/>Alot of what you say makes sense and some I was unaware of.<br/><br/>I guess I don't see VR as a game, but as an immersion and seeing Mac's are good at 3dcad and compiling video I would think they would be able to compile a scene well. I've even seen 3d renders of movie walk through. Creating a 3d world and placing cameras in areas to figure out how a scene would look<br/><br/>But I agree Mac's make more use of CPU cycles even by using there GPU's to help. WIth that said there are other directions one could take it. Like external thunderbolt video cards.<br/><br/>My big grip is the fact Octulas is looked at as a consumer product. If the requirements are that high, then it's more a pro product and needs to be advertized as that. I understand the technology is there but don't feel it's there to call it a consumer product.<br/><br/>Yes, you are right. Apple also has issues with software. Most aren't using "metal" the apple programming language which speeds up the processing for games because it's an Apple only solution where many use game engines that work on Microsoft Direct X or open source Opengl which most games use to run on Linux and oSX. Opengl is around 20% slower and sometime a lot more than that compared to direct x so a top of the line gaming card running in oSX runs as fast is a mid level gaming card in windows. So big problems not to mention most macs have built in cards that have no upgradability.<br/><br/>The mac pro is so different that Apple would have to do this as it wouldn't be worth a card vendor doing this as there is no profit in it for them with the small amount of possible buyers there would be for this. Apple doesn't like to loose money so I don't see this ever happening. Apple would loose money offering video card upgrades for mac pros.<br/><br/>Well he has a point though I do t care about oculus rift, rather wait for starVR. There should be an option to add better GPUs into an iMac and MacBook Pro. It is also sad that there is no more nVidia card, I liked the CUDA support now I will have to buy a PC and install Linux for my CUDA projects.<br/><br/>Gaming is a growing market and it won't be long until even iPhones have more GPU performance than the Macs. I agree that Apple should offer a high end GPU in a Mac<br/><br/>I am very bothered by the lack of high performance discrete graphics on Mac computers. Even the top of the like iMac uses an out of date mobile GPU which, of course, cannot be upgraded. If I want to develop software for VR, Apple has left me no choice but to buy or build a PC to run it on. As a big Apple fan (yes I admit it) this make me rather sad.<br/><br/>BTW, VR is not some passing fad. If you have tried it you know what I mean. VR is going to change gaming and content creation forever. My only worry about VR is that is too good. There could be millions of people that will become addicted to living and playing in virtual worlds. Look at how many people got addicted to MMOs that played on a flat screen. With VR you really feel like you are in the game.<br/><br/>Not worried about anything, i am pretty sure apple will have its own implementation for Mac and iOS when tech will be ready for consumers, right now it is more for hardcore users. Like always apple like to time its presence on right time, with right product. Have faith in apple.<br/><br/>It's funny that a lot of people know which vr is better based on os support. I guess you guys did heavy testing and now are the guy in the big electronic store that knows best.<br/><br/>HTC said it will bring support to the osx but that still needs to be seen.<br/><br/>I understand that a lot of you guys are stamped on there d**ks. But understand that Apple is more focused on laptops. And laptops can't be packed with more power than a PC, due to size, heat, power consumption etc.<br/><br/>He is right, even though he put it in **** terms. I love my Mac but Lord it needs a boost in graphics. Not that it needs to cost more but I would be more than willing to pay a little extra for a better graphics card or at least have the option to install my own. It's really too bad this guy had to make his statement sound like he is just plain uneducated. | O CEO de Oculus baixa o soporte de Mac para o Rift<br/><br/>O director xeral de Oculus, Palmer Luckey, non afundiu as súas palabras cando se lle preguntou nunha entrevista se os auriculares Rift VR apoiarían algunha vez o Mac. Se tiña algunha esperanza de que fose pronto, é posible que queira prepararse para algunha decepción.<br/><br/>Iso depende de Apple. Se algunha vez lanzan un bo ordenador, imos facelo.<br/><br/>O que está a referirse alí nun sentido menos diplomático é os gráficos discretos necesarios para executar o Rift. A simple verdade é que Apple simplemente non vai para gráficos de gama alta que cumpran os requisitos para os auriculares. Para o contexto, nun PC con Windows, necesitas un mínimo de unha NVIDIA GTX 970, unha tarxeta gráfica de $ 300.<br/><br/>Como Luke continuou dicindo:<br/><br/>Só se reduce ao feito de que Apple non prioriza GPUs de gama alta. Podes mercar un Mac Pro de $ 6.000 coa parte superior da liña AMD FirePro D700, e aínda non coincide coas nosas especificacións recomendadas. Entón, se priorizan as GPUs de gama alta como adoitaban facer durante un tempo, encántanos apoiar a Mac. Pero agora mesmo, non hai unha soa máquina que o soporte.<br/><br/>O Mac Pro non pode ser acusado de non embalar unha morea de cabalos de potencia, porque si, pero igualmente os gráficos FirePro están dirixidos máis cara ao mercado creativo, ao igual que o Mac Pro. O Mac Pro en particular supera con creces outros requisitos de hardware, pero, naturalmente, como o Rift é gráfico pesado, aquí é onde o déficit é. Luckey quizais estea un pouco por riba, pero tamén é o home detrás da fenda, polo que non hai dúbida de que o que di é verdade, aínda que non o diga particularmente ben.<br/><br/>Que vos parece, donos de Mac do mundo? Está ata molestado sobre o Oculus Rift ou é algo que desexaría que podería ter? Sona fóra nos comentarios de abaixo!<br/><br/>Comentarios do lector<br/><br/>O CEO de Oculus baixa o soporte de Mac para o Rift<br/><br/>Non, non molestado por iso, xa que realmente non estaba a planear mercar un Oculus Rift. Para min a categoría de produto aínda é demasiado cedo e demasiado nunha fase beta-kinda. Pero el levanta un punto válido. Apple debería tentar ir máis adiante do paquete CPU / GPU sabiamente. Agora mesmo están sempre detrás.<br/><br/>Perdoe, pero que é mellor HTC Vive? E Oculus Rift certamente soporta máquinas Linux que cumpren coas súas especificacións de hardware! (O problema non é o sistema operativo, senón o hardware.)<br/><br/>Tamén, mira por que o HTC Vive soporta OS X: inclúe máis do seu propio hardware. (É por iso que custa tanto.) As solucións Oculus - tanto o Rift como o Samsung Gear VR - requiren o hardware no que se está conectando para realizar máis do levantamento pesado.<br/><br/>VR non é un truco. Os televisores 3D non sempre dan moito dun efecto 3D, e non funciona con todo o mundo. VR traballa con todo o mundo, e os produtos oficiais Oculus e HTC Vive lanzan case ningunha latencia, polo que non debe haber ningún mal do movemento. Tamén hai moitos xogos de apoio<br/><br/>Obviamente, se o xogo é unha prioridade, xeralmente non estás no mercado para un Mac, con todo. Non moitos desenvolvedores de xogos soportan OSX polo que este tipo de dispositivos probablemente teñen un uso limitado nun Mac (para xogos, de todos os xeitos, para o que o Rift foi deseñado). Polo menos esa é a única razón pola que me vexo usando un. Definitivamente non o usaría para ver películas.<br/><br/>Apple implementou o motor Metal en El Capitan, pode haber algún plan para entrar no mercado de xogos (como Apple aprendeu de iOS o grande que é este mercado, só mire as aplicacións de maior recadación).<br/>Entón, agora o hardware está ausente e os desenvolvedores de xogos probablemente mostrarían algún interese, xa que os Macs agora hai unha cantidade aceptable de usuarios de Mac en todo o mundo.<br/><br/>Gustaríame ver a Apple entrar nese sector da industria. Actualmente non uso ningún produto de Apple, pero están a facer os movementos correctos en moitas áreas e estou moi intrigado.<br/><br/>Ademais, a competencia alimenta a innovación. Sei que as principais partes de ordenadores xa crean esa competencia, pero Apple ten a forza de vontade e o diñeiro para realmente virar cabezas. Pode que non gañen os xogos de números en termos de especificacións, en realidade raramente o fan, pero a maioría das persoas que se preocupan por facer a investigación saben que o rendemento! = a suma das partes do dispositivo. Apple pode facer máis con "menos". Sobre o papel, os seus produtos parecen inferiores, pero cando o hardware coidadosamente equilibrado cumpre co software especificamente deseñado, xeralmente funcionan tan ben como a competencia.<br/><br/>HA! Encántame como, de súpeto, ter un ordenador de alto rendemento non é importante para os fanáticos de Apple! Non hai un só Mac capaz dos gráficos máis finos. Non pode mercar un, non pode construír un. Mac non é capaz de ser o máis alto en rendemento e vostede é bo con iso. HA! Clásico!<br/><br/>Comprei o meu MacBook Pro Retina en 2012 debido á pantalla de alta resolución e a GPU non discreta. Con todo, para o meu escritorio construín un sistema cun monitor 4K, CPU i7 4790K, 3 GPU GTX 970 e 16 gb de memoria por menos do que pagaría por un iMac. Incluso teño un SSD configurado para arrancar en OSX. O meu punto é que Apple podería facer cousas semellantes se desexase, pero non o fai. De feito, mira o iMac máis recente. Inclúe gráficos discretos e unha unidade lenta de 5400 RPM. O meu ordenador pode non parecer tan bonito, e non é tan delgado, pero ao final é máis útil - non é por iso que compramos un ordenador en primeiro lugar?<br/><br/>Non vexo por que un Mac pro non pode facer uso do Oculus non está construído para renderizar vídeo. Entendo que non será capaz de correr en iMac e por iso o Oculus debe ser marcado para usuarios Pro debido aos requisitos e vén ao prezo.<br/><br/>Agora a xente está dicindo que o seu ordenador está facendo todo o levantamento pesado, entón por que o punto de prezo é máis de $ 800 para algo que non está facendo nada?<br/><br/>Estou emocionado coa dirección de VR pero non onde está no momento.<br/><br/>E a vosa afección non se agochará en nada. É $ 800 debido ao que fai a pantalla; ángulo de visión de 110 ° (aínda non ollo humano, pero moito máis preto que outras pantallas) con latencia súper baixa para reducir ou eliminar o mal do movemento nunha pantalla de 1200 x 1800 por ollo para calidade HD.<br/><br/>E si, os Mac son moi utilizados para a renderización de vídeo, pero esa renderización non ocorre a 30+ fps. Pode levar horas as máquinas de renderización de vídeo para renderizar un único fotograma e ás veces anos para renderizar unha película enteira. O produto final, ou material pre-renderizado, é o que logo se converte en 30 + fps.<br/><br/>Gracias @TheRealFixxer<br/>Moito do que dis ten sentido e algúns deles non o sabían.<br/><br/>Supoño que non vexo VR como un xogo, pero como unha inmersión e ver Mac son bos en 3dcad e compilación de vídeo eu pensaría que serían capaces de compilar unha escena ben. Eu mesmo vin renders 3d de película camiñar a través. Creando un mundo 3D e colocando cámaras en áreas para descubrir como se vería unha escena<br/><br/>Pero estou de acordo con que Mac faga máis uso dos ciclos de CPU, mesmo usando GPUs para axudar. Con iso dixo que hai outras direccións que se podería tomar. Como tarxetas de vídeo externas thunderbolt.<br/><br/>O meu gran agarre é o feito de que Octulas é visto como un produto de consumo. Se os requisitos son tan altos, entón é máis un produto profesional e necesita ser anunciado como iso. Entendo que a tecnoloxía está aí, pero non sinto que está aí para chamalo un produto de consumo.<br/><br/>Si, tes razón. Apple tamén ten problemas co software. A maioría non están usando "metal" a linguaxe de programación de Apple que acelera o procesamento para xogos porque é unha solución única de Apple onde moitos usan motores de xogos que funcionan en Microsoft Direct X ou Opengl de código aberto que a maioría dos xogos usan para executar en Linux e oSX. Opengl é arredor dun 20% máis lento e ás veces moito máis que iso en comparación co directo x, polo que unha parte superior da tarxeta de xogo en liña que se executa en oSX é tan rápida como unha tarxeta de xogo de nivel medio en fiestras. Así que grandes problemas para non mencionar a maioría dos macs teñen construído en tarxetas que non teñen capacidade de actualización.<br/><br/>O Mac Pro é tan diferente que Apple tería que facer isto, xa que non valdría a pena un vendedor de tarxetas facendo isto, xa que non hai ningún beneficio para eles coa pequena cantidade de posibles compradores que habería para isto. A Apple non lle gusta perder diñeiro, así que non vexo que isto nunca suceda. Apple perdería diñeiro ofrecendo actualizacións de tarxetas de vídeo para os profesionais de mac.<br/><br/>Ben, ten un punto aínda que non me importa oculus rift, máis ben esperar por starVR. Debería haber unha opción para engadir mellores GPUs nun iMac e MacBook Pro. Tamén é triste que non hai máis tarxeta nVidia, gustoume o soporte CUDA agora terei que mercar un PC e instalar Linux para os meus proxectos CUDA.<br/><br/>Os xogos son un mercado en crecemento e non pasará moito tempo ata que mesmo os iPhones teñan máis rendemento GPU que os Macs. Estou de acordo en que Apple debería ofrecer unha GPU de gama alta nun Mac<br/><br/>Estou moi molesto pola falta de gráficos discretos de alto rendemento en ordenadores Mac. Mesmo a parte superior do iMac usa unha GPU móbil obsoleta que, por suposto, non pode actualizarse. Se quero desenvolver software para VR, Apple non me deixou outra opción que mercar ou construír un PC para executalo. Como un gran fan de Apple (si, admito que) isto me fai bastante triste.<br/><br/>By the way, VR non é unha moda pasante. Se o tentaches, sabes o que quero dicir. VR vai cambiar o xogo e a creación de contido para sempre. A miña única preocupación sobre VR é que é demasiado bo. Pode haber millóns de persoas que se volverán adictas a vivir e xogar en mundos virtuais. Mira cantas persoas se volveron adictas a MMOs que xogaban nunha pantalla plana. Con VR realmente sentes que estás no xogo.<br/><br/>Non se preocupa por nada, estou bastante seguro de que Apple terá a súa propia implementación para Mac e iOS cando a tecnoloxía estea lista para os consumidores, agora mesmo é máis para os usuarios hardcore. Como sempre, á mazá gústalle cronometrar a súa presenza no momento adecuado, co produto correcto. Ten fe na mazá.<br/><br/>É gracioso que moita xente saiba que vr é mellor baseado no apoio. Supoño que fixeron probas pesadas e agora son o tipo na gran tenda electrónica que sabe mellor.<br/><br/>HTC dixo que traerá soporte para o osx, pero que aínda ten que ser visto.<br/><br/>Entendo que moitos de vostedes están estampados en d**ks. Pero entender que Apple está máis centrado en portátiles. E portátiles non pode ser embalado con máis enerxía que un PC, debido ao tamaño, calor, consumo de enerxía etc.<br/><br/>Ten razón, aínda que o puxo en termos ****. Encántame o meu Mac, pero Señor, necesita un impulso nos gráficos. Non que teña que custar máis, pero estaría máis que disposto a pagar un pouco máis por unha tarxeta gráfica mellor ou polo menos ter a opción de instalar a miña propia. É realmente unha pena que este tipo tivese que facer a súa declaración soar como se fose simplemente inculto. |

| What Guys Said 19<br/><br/>No, it is because entertainment producers and product marketers want actors/actresses and models who look like the majority of the audience, so that they are relatable and therefore more effective sales tools. I am sure that Asian women look wonderful to Asian men. To me, as a white man, they have zero appeal.<br/><br/>@cowboy101 I am 100 per cent straight. I do not go outside of my race. When I was a soldier I had the "me love you long time" experience in Asia. That has left me feeling uncomfortable whenever there are Asian females near me. Sometimes I become profoundly uncomfortable, even though the particular individuals have done nothing to merit it. During a visit to Thailand, I found that the only way to prevent myself being propositioned on the street was to take white a female with me as a minder.<br/><br/>Aha the thing is that there isn't many white people (or any at all) in China, but in 'white' places, (or at least Australia) there are quite a lot of Asians around there, which made me think about this question...<br/><br/>Maybe in parts of the country where you stick at (remember, birds of a feather...), just like to republicans it seems that most people are republican etc. While it can only be small minority that you are surrounded by.<br/><br/>And as far as I know, there are a lot of whites in china, mainly by business, etc. But it's simple, most of people there are Asian, so they prefere Asian girls (dogs like dogs , cats like cats, most people prefere their own kind). And there is nothing wrong with that. Same is in white countries.<br/><br/>I think Asians are the most beautful. Unfortunately for me the 2 I got involved with in my life one was using me for my place/internet a long time ago and the recent one was a gold digging stupid bitch. She never graduated college and was 30. I would be extremely happy if I met a smart cute Asian woman near my age that was not a gold digger.<br/><br/>@Prettyapathetic yes because when a man loves deeply he always good with you on bed no matter size of tits or colour of skin and a real man always respect a girl in every relation like mother, sister, wife, girlfriend etc<br/><br/>as a model from childhood I got my start with a company called sugar & spice. I was recruited in Japan while my family was stationed there.<br/><br/>you get a job because they are going for a certain look, who are they targeting, and the area you live in.<br/><br/>I had to leave the industry last year because of health reasons. I worked with with many types of people, korean, Japanese, chinese, polish, german, American, Spanish, arabic. I've worked with children, adults, teenagers all of these ethnicities.<br/><br/>I am half white half Native American (Lakota) so they loved my look from a young age. but there are many beauty standards in the industry and not all of them are as portrayed, some being made to look worse, and some not taken seriously enough...<br/><br/>Nope, it's because the Asian men are jealous and angry and invent thousands of excuses every rare time who have Asian women in the media because they are jealous of Asian women, and Americans want to keep the status of white women, this is why the couples between Asian women and white men are boycotted and all other race with white women are pushed, it's white women wiht white men and white women with other races in American media, since it's opression and offensive for the ego of men of other race the women of own race with white but white women with other race is "anti-racism". You need to understand the American political social engineering all over these years of media, democrats, politics and propaganda.<br/><br/>Anyway, in countries like china, japan, korea they have Asian men and Asian women only and the only exceptions are when they import a white women to make some fantasy scene for them but it's not so much, it's forbiden expose the hatred and jealousy of some Asian men.<br/><br/>The Asian boys will be happy if you say something against other men, but they will be angry if you say that the Asian girl will die for the blond girl date the handsome caucasian/white dude, they will try to force Asian women to make anything against these men to these small vocal group of Asian men feel better in their hatred, excuses, racism and jealousy. This is why Asian women is not showed so much, it's because the Asian men will be angry, it's because the white women can't be replaced, and the American propaganda is around white women with white men, white women with other race, white women against white men for the other race of men, white women in everything.<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>1&#124;0<br/><br/>0&#124;0<br/><br/>Opinion Owner<br/><br/>1mo<br/><br/>All the excuses of media and propaganda and all lies for racism, jealousy and hate aren't used against white women by the same men who invent the excuses, white women all the time in the media, understand, the American social engineering is made by democrats, democrats hate white men, and the most popular couples would be white men and Asian women but it's horrible for a few group of white racists who are racists even against Asians, is bad for the angry Asian men and their excuses, is bad for the white women, the democrats really don't like white men and work hard to try to make the couple and anything wiht white men and non-white women be related to bad things while pushing white women and non-white men. It's a American political problem.<br/><br/>I think it's a opression against the ego of the men of other race, so the white guys need to look bad, be some sort of jokes, be soft, while the scenes with white women and other race is the opposite of the scenes of white men and non-white women | O que dicían 19<br/><br/>Non, é porque os produtores de entretemento e comercializadores de produtos queren actores / actrices e modelos que se parecen á maioría da audiencia, para que sexan identificables e, polo tanto, ferramentas de vendas máis eficaces. Estou seguro de que as mulleres asiáticas parecen marabillosas para os homes asiáticos. Para min, como home branco, teñen cero atractivo.<br/><br/>@cowboy101 Son 100% heterosexual. Non saio da miña raza. Cando era soldado tiven a experiencia de "querote moito tempo" en Asia. Isto deixoume incómodo sempre que hai mulleres asiáticas preto de min. Ás veces vólvome profundamente incómodo, aínda que os individuos en particular non fixeron nada para merecelo. Durante unha visita a Tailandia, atopei que a única forma de evitar que me propoñan na rúa era levar unha muller branca comigo como coidadora.<br/><br/>Aha a cousa é que non hai moita xente branca (ou ningunha en absoluto) en China, pero en lugares "brancos", (ou polo menos Australia) hai bastantes asiáticos por aí, o que me fixo pensar sobre esta pregunta ...<br/><br/>Quizais en partes do país onde te quedes (lembra, paxaros dunha pluma...), ao igual que para os republicanos, parece que a maioría da xente é republicana etc. Mentres que só pode ser unha pequena minoría que está rodeado por.<br/><br/>E polo que sei, hai moitos brancos en China, principalmente por negocios, etc. Pero é sinxelo, a maioría da xente alí son asiáticas, polo que prefiren as nenas asiáticas (cans como cans , gatos como gatos, a maioría das persoas prefiren a súa propia especie). E iso non ten nada de malo. O mesmo ocorre nos países brancos.<br/><br/>Creo que os asiáticos son os máis fermosos. Desafortunadamente para min, o 2 con que me involucrei na miña vida un estaba a usarme para o meu lugar / internet hai moito tempo e o recente era unha puta estúpida cavando ouro. Nunca se graduou na universidade e tiña 30. Eu sería extremadamente feliz se eu coñecín unha muller asiática intelixente bonito preto da miña idade que non era un buscador de ouro.<br/><br/>@Prettyapathetic si, porque cando un home ama profundamente, sempre está ben contigo na cama, non importa o tamaño das tetas ou a cor da pel e un home real sempre respecta unha nena en todas as relacións como nai, irmá, esposa, noiva etc<br/><br/>como modelo dende a miña infancia comecei cunha empresa chamada Sugar & Spice. Reclutáronme en Xapón mentres a miña familia estaba alí.<br/><br/>tes un traballo porque están indo para unha certa ollada, quen están dirixindo, e a área que vives.<br/><br/>Tiven que deixar a industria o ano pasado por razóns de saúde. Traballei con moitos tipos de persoas, coreano, xaponés, chinés, polaco, alemán, americano, español, árabe. Traballei con nenos, adultos, adolescentes de todas estas etnias.<br/><br/>Eu son medio branco medio indíxena americano (Lakota) entón eles adoraron a miña mirada desde unha idade temperá. pero hai moitos estándares de beleza na industria e non todos eles son como retratado, algúns están sendo feitos para parecer peor, e algúns non tomado o suficientemente en serio ...<br/><br/>Non, é porque os homes asiáticos están celosos e enfadados e inventan miles de escusas cada vez que teñen mulleres asiáticas nos medios de comunicación porque están celosas das mulleres asiáticas, e os estadounidenses queren manter o status de mulleres brancas, é por iso que as parellas entre mulleres asiáticas e homes brancos son boicoteadas e todas as outras razas con mulleres brancas son empurradas. Hai que entender a enxeñaría social política estadounidense durante todos estes anos de medios, demócratas, política e propaganda.<br/><br/>De todos os xeitos, en países como China, Xapón, Corea teñen homes asiáticos e mulleres asiáticas só e as únicas excepcións son cando importan unha muller branca para facer algunha escena de fantasía para eles, pero non é tanto, está prohibido expoñer o odio e os celos dalgúns homes asiáticos.<br/><br/>Os rapaces asiáticos estarán felices se dicir algo contra outros homes, pero eles van estar enfadados se dicir que a nena asiática vai morrer para a moza loira data o guapo caucásico / branco cara, eles van tentar forzar as mulleres asiáticas para facer algo contra estes homes para estes pequenos grupos vocais de homes asiáticos se senten mellor no seu odio, escusas, racismo e celos. É por iso que as mulleres asiáticas non se mostran tanto, é porque os homes asiáticos estarán enfadados, é porque as mulleres brancas non poden ser substituídas, e a propaganda estadounidense é sobre mulleres brancas con homes brancos, mulleres brancas con outras razas, mulleres brancas contra homes brancos para a outra raza de homes, mulleres brancas en todo.<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>1&#124;0<br/><br/>0&#124;0<br/><br/>Opinión Propietario<br/><br/>1mo<br/><br/>Todas as escusas dos medios de comunicación e da propaganda e todas as mentiras para o racismo, os celos e o odio non son usados contra as mulleres brancas polos mesmos homes que inventan as escusas, as mulleres brancas todo o tempo nos medios de comunicación, entenden, a enxeñería social americana está feita por demócratas, as demócratas odian aos homes brancos, e as parellas máis populares serían homes brancos e mulleres asiáticas, pero é horrible para un grupo de homes brancos. É un problema político estadounidense.<br/><br/>Creo que é unha opresión contra o ego dos homes doutras razas, polo que os homes brancos necesitan parecer malos, ser algún tipo de broma, ser suaves, mentres que as escenas con mulleres brancas e outras razas son o oposto das escenas de homes brancos e mulleres non brancas. |
