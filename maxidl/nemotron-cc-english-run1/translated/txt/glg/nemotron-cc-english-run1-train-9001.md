| UNDERSTANDING SELF-EXECUTING TREATIES VIA STATE PRACTICE<br/><br/>Updated: Feb 2<br/><br/>Introduction:<br/><br/>Consider this paradox, when a country ratifies a treaty, it is said to have consented to accept the treaty in its entirety (reservations and declarations being exceptions); but in some cases, the countries go ahead and refuse to adhere to its provisions. For example, Article VI, Clause 2 of the American Constitution has the provisions that "all treaties … shall be the supreme Law of the Land." Although it is evident that treaties on their own do not have the same effect as federal laws. In truth, they only become operational once these provisions come into force as Federal law with Senate and Presidential approval. Although this is the practice, it is a generally accepted principle in international law that certain treaties have a binding effect on countries. The treaty must fulfil the requirement of being a self-executing treaty to affect the country without any corresponding domestic legislature directly.<br/><br/>This raises the question as to which treaty will qualify as "self-executing" and which will not?<br/><br/>Whether a treaty is a self-executing treaty or not is decided by national judges on a case-to-case basis (Buergenthal, 1992). In order to understand this, the paper will first look at the two types of theories followed by countries on the nature of treaties applying to domestic law. These two theories are monism and dualism. They basically view the framework of domestic and international law as a single hierarchy and two separate hierarchies, respectively (Wildhaber, 1971). Countries following monism believe that certain treaties immediately are binding and immediately have an effect on the country. Once the treaty has been ratified, it can be invoked in national courts and is considered to be a part of the law of the country. Countries following dualism believe that a treaty does not affect domestic law until it has been reinforced by a legislature passed in the parliament. An example of dualism is how the European Convention on Human Rights became operational in the United Kingdom after passing the Human Rights Act 1998 in their parliament (Laws, 2000).<br/><br/>International law is diverse, and so are the types of procedures different countries follow for the acceptance of treaties. Some constitutions' themselves mention the procedures for the ratification of a treaty. Some countries even have different treatment given to international treaty law and customary international law. Certain international organizations like the European Union often affect the domestic law of its member states. The member states of the European Union have to give effect to certain forms of community legislature. Although, it has an essential difference from self-executing treaties. The difference is that it is not for national judges to decide whether the provisions are self-executing or not, but rather for the European Court of Justice to interpret under its constitutive treaties. Other forms of international law formed via resolutions or such might not have the same effect for these states. Nevertheless, they might consider them as forms of "soft law" and look into them to interpret the intent of the law. Sometimes, proclamations made by the judicial organs of international organizations such as the Inter-American Court of Human Rights affect their member states. Although these proclamations are not binding on the member states, the national judges seem to refer to these for authoritative interpretation.<br/><br/>Therefore, a case-to-case approach must be taken while analyzing the procedures and precedents set in different countries. To examine the concept of self-executing treaties, this paper will compare the precedents set by different jurisdictions. If the reader wishes to conduct a similar analysis, they can do so by looking into the different national yearbooks on international law. Mostly, these yearbooks will have a section devoted to the relationship between international and national law.<br/><br/>International Jurisprudence:<br/><br/>The most significant issue that comes up for national courts is whether the treaty is self-executing? If the treaty can be applied without any additional domestic legislature having passed to reinforce it. This question came up in the case of Czesław S v State Treasury and Minister of the State Treasury, wherein the Polish Constitutional Court held that since the treaty provisions referred to domestic measures to be taken, the treaty was not self-executing in nature (Bug river claims, Czesław S v State Treasury and Minister of the State Treasury, 2003). Essentially, when the treaty refers to domestic measures to be taken, it does not in itself create new obligations. It instead reinforces the treaty's intent for the domestic legal process to take measures for the same. A similar issue was raised in the Sosa case in the United States of America. In this case, the court considered whether the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights was a self-executing treaty. The American Supreme Court has also declared that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is not a self-executing treaty (Court, 2004). The Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland also examined the self-executing nature of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The issue before the court was whether Article 13(2)(b) and (c) were self-executing in nature. The court examined whether the treaty was partially self-executing and did so by checking whether there existed a minimum core content for the treaty to be applicable. The court held that it found no such provision within the treaty (A and B v Government of the Canton of Zurich, 2000).<br/><br/>It is essential to understand that these issues differ from the fundamental question of whether international law can be applied as part of the law of the land? In order to answer this question, the paper will examine the judgement by the Supreme Court of the Dominican Republic. The Supreme Court stated that Article 3 of the Dominican Republic's Constitution made international law binding on the domestic legal order. The court rejected the Superior Land Court's interpretation that these treaties were "foreign legislature" and not part of the domestic legal order. The Supreme Court laid down that all treaties ratified by the Dominican Republic formed a part of Dominican Law and, therefore, can be termed as self-executing (Gallardo Montilla v Gallardo Concepción and ors, 1997). The Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland has examined whether the Libson Treaty was self-executing and directly applicable to Swiss Universities. The court held, "According to relevant case law, a treaty norm is directly applicable if its content is sufficiently precise and clear to form the basis of a decision in a particular case. The norm thus has to be justiciable, i.e. define the rights and obligations of an individual and be directed at the competent authorities" (X v University of Lucerne, 2014). This implies that whether the treaty is directly applicable or not, depends upon on whether the norm is justiciable. The Lisbon Treaty is based on the principle of qualifications acquired aboard. This is conveyed through Article IV (1) of the treaty. The purpose of this was to create an obligation for states to show that their decision-making process is fair, transparent and non-discriminatory. The responsibility for proving that the applicant has not met the required criteria is on the "body undertaking the assessment." The treaty guarantees procedural safeguards, which are generally accepted by countries and hence, the court held this treaty to be self-executing. This goes on to showcase the different interpretations undertaken by the courts of various countries.<br/><br/>It is essential to observe whether the norms set out by treaties are actually being complied with. The case laws from various jurisdictions have emphasized that national courts are the final authority on the issue of whether a treaty is self-executing. There is also an inherent duty cast on countries for the observance and due performance of treaties. Such is cast by the Pacta Sunt Servanda rule as enshrined within Article 26 of the Vienna Convention on Law of Treaties (VCLT). Article 27 goes on to reinforce it by stating that international law obligations cannot be ignored by using domestic law as a justification. Many countries' courts have used this as a source of interpretation, such as the Latvian Constitutional Court. In the case of a national norm conflicting with an international norm, the court held that the national norm was null and void. To reach its conclusion, the court strongly relied on the necessary performance of treaties in good faith as envisaged in Article 26 of the VCLT (Linija v Latvia, 2004).<br/><br/>Conclusion:<br/><br/>From the above, it is clear that treaties have particular requirements before they can be considered self-executing. However, keeping all of these aside, the most important still remains the national courts' interpretation. The national courts decide whether the treaty can be called self-executing or not. Although their Constitution's might contain a provision regarding treaty law being the supreme law of the land, courts from different countries interpret these provisions in different manners. This can be seen as to how the American and Dominican Constitutions' both contain these provisions but follow completely different interpretations of the same. The term "self-executing" may not be congruous for these treaties since, in practice, they still need approval from the national courts. Ideally, the way forward should be that countries acknowledge the self-executing nature of treaties and treat them in a fashion wherein Article 26 and 27 of the VCLT are respected. Again, this is the "ideal" situation and is not likely to find its way into state practice of certain jurisdictions anytime soon. Still, hope can be gained via looking into the interpretations of national courts that respect these norms and hopefully pave the way for other courts to acknowledge this.<br/><br/>References:<br/><br/>Buergenthal, T.

Por exemplo, o Artigo VI, Cláusula 2 da Constitución Americana ten as disposicións que "todos os tratados ... serán a Lei suprema do Land". Aínda que é evidente que os tratados por si sós non teñen o mesmo efecto que as leis federais. En realidade, só entran en funcionamento unha vez que estas disposicións entran en vigor como lei federal con aprobación do Senado e da Presidencia. Aínda que esta é a práctica, é un principio xeralmente aceptado no dereito internacional que certos tratados teñen un efecto vinculante sobre os países. O tratado debe cumprir o requisito de ser un tratado autoexecutivo que afecte directamente ao país sen ningunha lexislatura interna correspondente.<br/><br/>Isto fai que se pregunte cal é o tratado que se autoexecuta e cal non.<br/><br/>Se un tratado é un tratado de auto-ejecución ou non é decidida polos xuíces nacionais sobre unha base de caso a caso (Buergenthal, 1992). Para entender isto, o artigo examinará primeiro os dous tipos de teorías seguidas polos países sobre a natureza dos tratados que se aplican ao dereito interno. Estas dúas teorías son o monismo e o dualismo. Basicamente ven o marco do dereito interno e internacional como unha única xerarquía e dúas xerarquías separadas, respectivamente (Wildhaber, 1971). Os países que seguen o monismo cren que certos tratados son inmediatamente vinculantes e teñen un efecto inmediato no país. Unha vez que o tratado foi ratificado, pode ser invocado nos tribunais nacionais e considérase parte da lei do país. Os países que seguen o dualismo cren que un tratado non afecta á lexislación interna ata que sexa reforzado por unha lexislatura aprobada no parlamento. Un exemplo de dualismo é como a Convención Europea de Dereitos Humanos entrou en vigor no Reino Unido despois de aprobar a Lei de Dereitos Humanos de 1998 no seu parlamento (Leis, 2000).<br/><br/>O dereito internacional é diverso, e tamén o son os tipos de procedementos que os diferentes países adoptan para a aceptación de tratados. Algunhas constitucións mencionan os procedementos para a ratificación dun tratado. Algúns países teñen mesmo tratamento diferente dado ao dereito internacional de tratados e ao dereito internacional consuetudinario. Certas organizacións internacionais como a Unión Europea a miúdo afectan á lexislación interna dos seus estados membros. Os Estados membros da Unión Europea teñen que dar efecto a certas formas de lexislatura comunitaria. Aínda que, ten unha diferenza esencial dos tratados de auto-execución. A diferenza é que non corresponde aos xuíces nacionais decidir se as disposicións son autoexecutivas ou non, senón que o Tribunal de Xustiza Europeo as interpreta nos seus tratados constitutivos. Outras formas de dereito internacional formadas a través de resolucións ou semellantes poderían non ter o mesmo efecto para estes estados. Con todo, poderían consideralos como formas de "lei suave" e mirar neles para interpretar a intención da lei. Ás veces, as proclamas feitas polos órganos xudiciais de organizacións internacionais como a Corte Interamericana de Dereitos Humanos afectan aos seus estados membros. Aínda que estas proclamas non son vinculantes para os Estados membros, os xuíces nacionais parecen referirse a estes para a súa interpretación autorizada.<br/><br/>Polo tanto, debe adoptarse un enfoque caso a caso ao analizar os procedementos e precedentes establecidos en diferentes países. Para examinar o concepto de tratados de auto-ejecución, este documento comparará os precedentes establecidos por diferentes xurisdicións. Se o lector desexa realizar unha análise similar, pode facelo mirando os diferentes anuarios nacionais sobre dereito internacional. Na súa maioría, estes anuarios terán unha sección dedicada á relación entre o dereito internacional e nacional.<br/><br/>Jurisprudencia internacional:<br/><br/>A cuestión máis importante que xorde para os tribunais nacionais é se o tratado é auto-ejecutante? Se o tratado pode ser aplicado sen ningunha lexislatura interna adicional ter aprobado para reforzalo. Esta cuestión xurdiu no caso de Czesław S v. Tesouro do Estado e Ministro do Tesouro do Estado, no que o Tribunal Constitucional polaco sostivo que, xa que as disposicións do tratado se referían a medidas internas que se debían tomar, o tratado non se autoexecutaba por natureza (Bug River Reclamations, Czesław S. v. Tesouro do Estado e Ministro do Tesouro do Estado, 2003). En esencia, cando o tratado se refire ás medidas internas que se deben tomar, non crea en si mesma novas obrigacións, senón que reforza a intención do tratado de que o proceso xurídico interno tome medidas para o mesmo. Unha cuestión similar foi levantada no caso Sosa nos Estados Unidos de América, neste caso, o tribunal considerou se o Pacto Internacional de Dereitos Civís e Políticos era un tratado autoexecutivo. A Corte Suprema dos Estados Unidos tamén declarou que o Pacto Internacional de Dereitos Civís e Políticos non é un tratado autoexecutivo (Court, 2004). O Tribunal Supremo Federal de Suíza tamén examinou a natureza autoexecutiva do Pacto Internacional de Dereitos Civís e Políticos. A cuestión que o tribunal tiña ante si o artigo 13 (2) (b) e (c) eran de natureza autoexecutiva. O tribunal examinou se o tratado se autoexecutaba parcialmente e comprobou se existía un contido básico mínimo para que o tratado fose aplicable. O tribunal sostivo que non atopou tal disposición no tratado (A e B contra o Goberno do Cantón de Zúric, 2000).<br/><br/>É esencial entender que estas cuestións difiren da cuestión fundamental de se o dereito internacional pode aplicarse como parte do dereito do país. Para responder a esta pregunta, o documento examinará a sentenza do Tribunal Supremo da República Dominicana. O Tribunal Supremo declarou que o artigo 3 da Constitución da República Dominicana fixo o dereito internacional vinculante para o ordenamento xurídico interno. O tribunal rexeitou a interpretación do Tribunal Superior de Terras de que estes tratados eran "lexislatura estranxeira" e non formaban parte do ordenamento xurídico interno. O Tribunal Supremo estableceu que todos os tratados ratificados pola República Dominicana formaban parte da Lei Dominicana e, polo tanto, poden denominarse autoexecutivos (Gallardo Montilla v Gallardo Concepción e ors, 1997). O Tribunal Supremo Federal de Suíza examinou se o Tratado de Libson era autoexecutivo e directamente aplicable ás universidades suízas. Segundo a xurisprudencia pertinente, unha norma do tratado é directamente aplicable se o seu contido é suficientemente preciso e claro para formar a base dunha decisión nun caso particular. Así, a norma ten que ser xustificable, é dicir, definir os dereitos e obrigas dun individuo e dirixirse ás autoridades competentes" (X v Universidade de Lucerna, 2014). Isto implica que se o tratado é directamente aplicable ou non, depende de se a norma é xustificable. O Tratado de Lisboa baséase no principio de cualificacións adquiridas a bordo. Isto transmítese a través do artigo IV (1) do tratado. O obxectivo disto era crear unha obrigación para os Estados de demostrar que o seu proceso de toma de decisións é xusto, transparente e non discriminatorio. A responsabilidade de demostrar que o solicitante non cumpriu os criterios requiridos recae no "organismo que realiza a avaliación". O tratado garante garantías procesuais, que son xeralmente aceptadas polos países e, polo tanto, o tribunal considerou que este tratado era autoexecutivo. Isto segue a mostrar as diferentes interpretacións realizadas polos tribunais de varios países.<br/><br/>É esencial observar se as normas establecidas polos tratados se están cumprindo realmente. As leis de casos de varias xurisdicións enfatizaron que os tribunais nacionais son a autoridade final sobre a cuestión de se un tratado é auto-ejecutante. Tamén existe un deber inherente aos países para a observancia e a debida execución dos tratados, tal é o que establece a regra Pacta Sunt Servanda consagrada no artigo 26 da Convención de Viena sobre o Dereito dos Tratados (VCLT). O artigo 27 continúa reforzándoo afirmando que as obrigas do dereito internacional non poden ser ignoradas usando o dereito interno como xustificación. Moitos tribunais de países usaron isto como fonte de interpretación, como o Tribunal Constitucional de Letonia. No caso dunha norma nacional en conflito cunha norma internacional, o tribunal sostivo que a norma nacional era nula e sen efecto. Para chegar á súa conclusión, o tribunal confiou fortemente na necesaria execución de tratados de boa fe, tal como prevé o artigo 26 da VCLT (Linija v Letonia, 2004).<br/><br/>Conclusión:<br/><br/>A partir do anterior, está claro que os tratados teñen requisitos particulares antes de que poidan ser considerados autoexecutivos. Con todo, deixando de lado todos estes, o máis importante segue sendo a interpretación dos tribunais nacionais. Os tribunais nacionais deciden se o tratado pode ser auto-ejecutado ou non. Aínda que a súa Constitución pode conter unha disposición que di que o dereito dos tratados é a lei suprema do país, os tribunais de diferentes países interpretan estas disposicións de diferentes maneiras. Isto pódese ver como as Constitucións americana e dominicana conteñen estas disposicións, pero seguen interpretacións completamente diferentes da mesma. O termo "autoexecución" pode non ser congruente para estes tratados, xa que, na práctica, aínda necesitan a aprobación dos tribunais nacionais. Idealmente, o camiño a seguir debería ser que os países recoñecesen a natureza auto-ejecutante dos tratados e os tratasen dun xeito no que se respecten os artigos 26 e 27 da VCLT. Unha vez máis, esta é a situación "ideal" e non é probable que atope o seu camiño na práctica estatal de certas xurisdicións en breve. Aínda así, a esperanza pódese gañar mirando as interpretacións dos tribunais nacionais que respectan estas normas e esperamos que preparen o camiño para que outros tribunais recoñezan isto.<br/><br/>Referencias:<br/><br/>Buergenthal, T.

Whether it is a last-minute job request or a paper that you forgot to write and it is due the next day, stress can always find a way into your day if you allow it. Today I will show you a few things you can do to eliminate or prevent stress.<br/><br/>The first thing you can do is to exercise. Exercising is a great way to relieve stress because it lowers the stress hormone in your body known as cortisol. The lower levels of cortisol in your body, the lower your stress level will be. Exercise can also increase your confidence, and when your confidence is up then your stress is usually down. For me, when I get stressed, I always exercise by going to the gym and practice boxing, it helps me burn calories and reduce stress while having fun.<br/><br/>Writing things down has been a way to calm people down for a very long time, and it is the next topic on our list. Writing down what is making you stressed is a way to clear the mind, and it helps get rid of stress as well. I have a similar experience when writing stories, usually if I cannot think of a new idea because of an old one, I will write the old idea down and think on it. That is when new ideas start to spring up and I can continue writing normally. It is the same with stress. Think about a stream it continues to flow down it's path until it hits a beaver dam, and that dam blocks the flow of water and everything starts to build up. The only way to get the water flow back to normal is to remove the dam. This is where writing comes in. When you write it down, you are removing stress piece by piece until you can think normally again.<br/><br/>Stress can come into our lives through doors in our life that we keep open. Procrastination is a way that we can leave the doors open for stress. Waiting until tomorrow may be fun for today, but it will hurt you tomorrow, and is a very short-sighted solution. The longer you wait to do something, the larger that something becomes, and the larger it becomes the more stress you will be inviting into your life. Taking care of something as soon as we receive it is a great way to prevent stress, but it is something that takes great discipline to do. The more you cut Procrastination out of your life, the more stress free you will be. So shut that door, you're letting all the cold air out.<br/><br/>So let's review: Exercise, Write down what is stressing you, and Do not Procrastinate. These are only a few ways to relieve stress but to me, they are the most effective. While I know these may not work for everyone I would like to invite anyone feeling stressed to research how to get rid of it. | BLOGS<br/><br/>Vexa a nosa colección de blogs escritos por compañeiros de equipo.<br/><br/>BLOGS INFORMATIVOS<br/><br/>Non o estreses<br/><br/>por<br/>Kristen Hogan<br/>&#124; Nov 12, 2020<br/><br/>O estrés, non importa o ben que van as cousas, sempre pode atopar unha forma de levantar a súa fea cabeza. Se é unha solicitude de traballo de último minuto ou un papel que esqueceu de escribir e é debido ao día seguinte, o estrés sempre pode atopar un camiño no seu día se o permite. Hoxe vouche mostrar algunhas cousas que podes facer para eliminar ou previr o estrés.<br/><br/>O primeiro que podes facer é facer exercicio. O exercicio é unha gran forma de aliviar o estrés porque reduce a hormona do estrés no teu corpo coñecida como cortisol. Canto máis baixos sexan os niveis de cortisol no teu corpo, menor será o teu nivel de estrés. O exercicio tamén pode aumentar a súa confianza, e cando a súa confianza está arriba, entón o seu estrés é xeralmente baixo. Para min, cando estou estresado, sempre fago exercicio indo ao ximnasio e practicando boxeo, axúdame a queimar calorías e reducir o estrés mentres me divirto.<br/><br/>Escribindo as cousas foi unha forma de calmar a xente durante moito tempo, e é o seguinte tema da nosa lista. Escribindo o que está facendo vostede estresado é unha forma de limpar a mente, e axuda a desfacerse do estrés tamén. Teño unha experiencia similar cando escribo historias, xeralmente se non podo pensar nunha idea nova debido a unha vella, escribirei a vella idea e pensarei nela. É cando novas ideas comezan a xurdir e podo continuar escribindo normalmente. O mesmo ocorre co estrés. Pense nun fluxo que continúa a fluír polo seu camiño ata que golpea unha presa de castor, e esa presa bloquea o fluxo de auga e todo comeza a acumularse. A única forma de conseguir que o fluxo de auga volva á normalidade é eliminar a presa. Aquí é onde entra a escribir. Cando o escribes, estás eliminando o estrés peza a peza ata que poidas pensar normalmente de novo.<br/><br/>O estrés pode entrar nas nosas vidas a través de portas na nosa vida que mantemos abertas. A procrastinación é unha forma de deixar as portas abertas para o estrés. Agardar ata mañá pode ser divertido para hoxe, pero mañá faráche dano, e é unha solución moi miope. Canto máis esperes para facer algo, máis grande se fai algo, e canto maior se fai, máis estrés estarás convidando á túa vida. Coidar algo tan pronto como o recibimos é unha gran forma de previr o estrés, pero é algo que require unha gran disciplina. Canto máis elimines a procrastinación da túa vida, máis libre de estrés estarás. Así que pecha esa porta, estás deixando saír todo o aire frío.<br/><br/>Así que imos revisar: Exercicio, Escriba o que está estresándoo, e non procrastinar. Estas son só algunhas formas de aliviar o estrés, pero para min, son os máis eficaces. Aínda que sei que isto pode non funcionar para todos, gustaríame invitar a calquera que se sinta estresado a investigar como desfacerse del. |
