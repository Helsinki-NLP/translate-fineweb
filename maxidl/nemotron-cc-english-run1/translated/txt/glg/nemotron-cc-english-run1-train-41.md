| Bacopa<br/><br/>19 Nov 2015<br/>Posted by Doxiderol<br/><br/>Bacopa is a perennial plant that thrives in marshy subtropical and tropical regions around the globe. The highly regarded herb is a key ingredient in Doxiderol, a nutritional supplement that enhances cognitive function. Bacopa was chosen for its ability to protect the brain and increase acetylcholine, a biochemical messenger that enables the nervous system to relay information.<br/><br/>Ayurvedic practitioners first described the therapeutic properties of bacopa in 300 BC. The physicians recorded bacopa's abilities to enhance intelligence and memory. Nearly 2,500 years later, a growing body of modern research confirms the cognitive benefits of bacopa recorded in the Ayurvedic text.<br/><br/>In 1987, researchers in India evaluated the effects of bacopa on the intellectual function of school-aged children. During the four-week study, they administered bacopa to 40 children who were 6 to 8 years old. The scientists determined that bacopa increased perception and memory. The children were able to solve maze exercises quicker and more accurately after receiving bacopa. Many parents in India routinely use bacopa to enhance their children's intellectual development.<br/><br/>A 12-week study published in the August 2001 issue of Psychopharmacology investigated the effects of bacopa on cognitive function. Scientists randomly assigned the healthy volunteers, aged 18 to 65, to receive bacopa or an inactive substance. They also used a double-blind configuration for the study to conceal the identities of the products. Researchers use this design to ensure that the test results are valid because it eliminates bias by the researchers and participants. The bacopa group experienced a significant improvement in the speed at which they were able to process visual information. The participants also learned faster and stored new memories more efficiently.<br/><br/>In 2007, a Texas A&M College of Medicine laboratory study revealed one of the mechanisms responsible for bacopa's ability to promote brain health. According to the scientists, bacopa uses polyphenols to prevent oxidative stress and the damage that it causes to healthy brain cells. Bacopa also reduces harmful deposits of a substance known as beta-amyloid, which is the primary component of the plaque in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease.<br/><br/>A double-blind study published in the July 2008 issue of the Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine evaluated the effect of bacopa on elderly patients. The study confirmed that bacopa increased cognitive performance while reducing stress. According to the authors, the benefits achieved in this study confirmed the results of earlier research.<br/><br/>A 90-day study published in the December 2008 issue of Phytotherapy Research confirms the cognitive benefits that were previously demonstrated in other bacopa studies. Bacopa significantly improved the ability of the participants to temporarily store and use information required for completing a complex task. The double-blind study also demonstrated that bacopa reduced the time required to process visual information.<br/><br/>In addition to enhancing nerve signal transmission, the scientists theorize that bacopa increases cognitive function by reducing anxiety. Numerous studies indicate that anxiety interferes with the ability to perform tasks that require higher-level cognitive functions, such as learning and memorization. Stress disrupts biochemical messengers and healthy nerve signal transmission. Bacopa alleviates stress and restores a sense of calm by increasing acetylcholine levels, which reduces your heart rate and enables you to take deeper breaths.<br/><br/>Doxiderol is a great way to obtain the benefits of bacopa. This holistic supplement also contains other natural ingredients that promote brain health and support your ability to focus and concentrate on complex task as well as memorize information. | Bacopa<br/><br/>19 Nov 2015<br/>Publicado en Doxiderol<br/><br/>Bacopa é unha planta perenne que prospera en rexións pantanosas subtropicais e tropicais en todo o mundo. A herba altamente considerada é un ingrediente clave en Doxiderol, un suplemento nutricional que mellora a función cognitiva. Bacopa foi elixido pola súa capacidade de protexer o cerebro e aumentar a acetilcolina, un mensaxeiro bioquímico que permite ao sistema nervioso transmitir información.<br/><br/>Os practicantes ayurvédicos describían por primeira vez as propiedades terapéuticas da bacopa en 300 a.C. Os médicos rexistraron as habilidades da bacopa para mellorar a intelixencia e a memoria. Case 2.500 anos despois, un crecente corpo de investigación moderna confirma os beneficios cognitivos da bacopa rexistrados no texto ayurvédico.<br/><br/>En 1987, investigadores da India avaliaron os efectos da bacopa na función intelectual dos nenos en idade escolar. Durante o estudo de catro semanas, administraron bacopa a 40 nenos de 6 a 8 anos. Os científicos determinaron que a bacopa aumentou a percepción e a memoria. Os nenos foron capaces de resolver os exercicios de labirinto máis rápido e con máis precisión despois de recibir bacopa. Moitos pais na India usan rutinariamente bacopa para mellorar o desenvolvemento intelectual dos seus fillos.<br/><br/>Un estudo de 12 semanas publicado no número de agosto de 2001 de Psychopharmacology investigou os efectos da bacopa na función cognitiva. Os científicos asignaron aleatoriamente aos voluntarios sans, de 18 a 65 anos, para recibir bacopa ou unha substancia inactiva. Tamén utilizaron unha configuración de dobre cego para o estudo para ocultar as identidades dos produtos. Os investigadores usan este deseño para garantir que os resultados das probas sexan válidos porque elimina o sesgo dos investigadores e participantes. O grupo de bacopa experimentou unha mellora significativa na velocidade coa que eran capaces de procesar información visual. Os participantes tamén aprenderon máis rápido e almacenaron novos recordos de forma máis eficiente.<br/><br/>En 2007, un estudo de laboratorio do Texas A & M College of Medicine revelou un dos mecanismos responsables da capacidade da bacopa para promover a saúde cerebral. Segundo os científicos, a bacopa usa polifenois para previr o estrés oxidativo e o dano que causa ás células cerebrais sas. Bacopa tamén reduce os depósitos nocivos dunha substancia coñecida como beta-amiloide, que é o compoñente principal da placa no cerebro dos pacientes con enfermidade de Alzheimer.<br/><br/>Un estudo dobre cego publicado no número de xullo de 2008 do Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine avaliou o efecto da bacopa en pacientes anciáns. O estudo confirmou que a bacopa aumentou o rendemento cognitivo ao reducir o estrés. Segundo os autores, os beneficios obtidos neste estudo confirmaron os resultados de investigacións anteriores.<br/><br/>Un estudo de 90 días publicado na edición de decembro de 2008 de Phytotherapy Research confirma os beneficios cognitivos que se demostraron anteriormente noutros estudos de bacopa. Bacopa mellorou significativamente a capacidade dos participantes para almacenar e usar temporalmente a información necesaria para completar unha tarefa complexa. O estudo dobre cego tamén demostrou que bacopa reduciu o tempo necesario para procesar a información visual.<br/><br/>Ademais de mellorar a transmisión do sinal nervioso, os científicos teorizan que a bacopa aumenta a función cognitiva ao reducir a ansiedade. Numerosos estudos indican que a ansiedade interfire coa capacidade de realizar tarefas que requiren funcións cognitivas de nivel superior, como a aprendizaxe e a memorización. O estrés interrompe os mensaxeiros bioquímicos e a transmisión de sinais nerviosos saudables. Bacopa alivia o estrés e restaura unha sensación de calma ao aumentar os niveis de acetilcolina, o que reduce a frecuencia cardíaca e permítelle respirar máis profundamente.<br/><br/>Doxiderol é unha gran forma de obter os beneficios da bacopa. Este suplemento holístico tamén contén outros ingredientes naturais que promoven a saúde do cerebro e apoian a súa capacidade de concentrarse e concentrarse en tarefas complexas, así como memorizar información. |

She can also sense demonic auras as well as evil auras. When she was born and growing, however, her powers were sealed and she was much less powerful. Since the defeat of the one sealing her powers, Kagome has reached her full potential.<br/><br/>PURIFICATION By making a physical connection, Kagome has the ability to purify both poison and darkness from a subject (living and inanimate). To do so, she projects her spiritual powers through her hand.<br/><br/>SPIRITUAL BARRIERS With her full potential, Kagome has the ability to create a barrier around herself and expand it around others. It is a dome-shaped barrier that can destroy weak demons that make contact with the barrier.<br/><br/>IMPROVED EYESIGHT<br/>Kagome has the ability to see things that are often invisible to the human eye: ghosts, spirits, divine and evil auras.<br/><br/>ABILITIES WITH WEAPONS<br/>Kagome has the ability to use a bow and arrow. She has been self trained, and after years of practice, her arrow rarely misses its mark. Alongside this, Kagome has the ability to infuse her arrows with powers. She can infuse an arrows with her spiritual powers which allows them to penetrate demonic forces, destroy spells, and purify objects. She can infuse her bow with her powers and deflect enemy attacks. She has the ability to infuse her arrows with purifying energy to purify poison as well as powerful, long distant demonic attacks. And, finally, she has the ability to bypass others with her arrow: If her target happens to be behind a barrier or a hostage, the arrow can teleport and hit only her target<br/><br/>The rest of her abilities have become rather unimportant as they are related to time travel (through the Bone Eater's Well), the Shikon Jewel, or her previous incarnation.<br/><br/>the canon<br/><br/>Kagome has been pulled a few days after her high school graduation, however, before the Bone Eater's Well has opened again to allow her to return to the past permanently.<br/><br/>freestyle<br/><br/>memories<br/><br/>かごめ<br/><br/>The sound of her name was a soft whisper in the back of her mind, like a call muffled by the wind. It was the sound of a distant memory, a voice that she had started to forget but desperately clung to all the same. It was her mother's voice, twisted in the sorrow of her lost daughter. Afterall, Kagome banished without a trace. She vividly remembered those moments, the way the day had begun, what she had for breakfast and the last thing she had said to her mother. It was haunting, those memories, because it was like any other time she had slipped between worlds. She had woken, listless, because she had no purpose outside of school. She could find a job, and was scheduled for an interview that day. Her heart hadn't been in it, but it was what she needed to do.<br/><br/>She remembered the feeling of dread, sucking it up and giving herself a pep talk that she could do this. That she could progress in the life that she was meant to now that things had been settled in the past. Of course, she had the lingering feeling that she no longer belonged in her own time or her own life. Not with everything that she had left behind.<br/><br/>Kagome remembered the feeling of the wood beneath her fingers, the way her hand had curled into the handle to slide the door open. She remembered that she paused, turning to her mother with a bright and vibrant smile as she shook herself from her stupor. "I'm taking off." She remembered how strong her voice sounded, the smile on her mother's lips as her eyes shone with pride. Her mother bade her farewell, which didn't seem any different than before but somehow the weight of the words settled in heavier on Kagome's shoulders the more she reflected.<br/><br/>Briefly, the thoughts flickered forward, wondering if her mother worried over her, missed her like she did. Kagome could openly admit that her mother's strength, her support for the fact that her daughter slipped through time so frequently. There were times when she thought herself weak for not having the woman to lean on.<br/><br/>However, she remembered that she did muster up a meager amount of strength.She could remember the shift in the air, the temperature notably different than what she had expected, blinking at the sudden and unfamiliar surroundings. It was not her family's shrine. And when she turned to go back, to slip through the door she had come through, she was met with unfamiliar and cold metal beneath her fingertips and an interior that was not the entrance of her house. A man stood before her, behind a counter, who stared at her with eyes as wide as her own.<br/><br/>She didn't panic, at least. Being torn through time and placed in impossible situations at least built your willpower as far as strange happenings went. Because it wasn't every day that someone found themselves dragged into the past by a demon, intent on ripping a powerful jewel from their body that they didn't even know was there. And then there was the fact that she had shattered said powerful jewel into who knows how many pieces and was tasked on finding them. Such things were not normal, and she had needed to square up and roll with it once she realized that was her reality. It had seemed so simple, just gather the shards and fix the jewel.<br/><br/>But it hadn't been easy, there were many demons after the shards and the jewel itself. And one particularly powerful demon with a wish that he was determined to see fulfilled. To this day, she had never learned his wish but knew it had never been granted even once he had the blasted thing completed. He had ruined so many lives for the sake of nothing. Ruined so many lives for such a futile task. Naraku had been the most difficult foe, and the one who had been the center of everything that had gone wrong in all of her friend's lives.<br/><br/>But, it was that unpredicability, that necessity to roll with what was happening and the willpower that she had gained from her adventure that she remembered drawing upon to come up with a story that fit in the moment that didn't seem too whimsical or far fetched. She needed to be believed, she needed to survive.<br/><br/>Afterall, she faced worse than a man in a camera store. She had lied through her teeth to save her life before.<br/><br/>"I was looking for a job." In the end, it wasn't a complete lie. After all, she had set out of her house with the intent of attending a job interview. Her state of dress would at least attest to that much. It was one of the easier fibs she had ever told.<br/><br/>And, for some reason, that crazy man hired her.<br/><br/>かごめ<br/><br/>Kagomed rolled over in her bed as she pushed back the distant memories, refusing to acknowledge that she was really awake. She clawed at the last glimpses of sleep, begging it to return and to take her back into its embrace. She closed her eyes, willing sleep to come and was only met with memories. The echoes of a song sang in the distance of her memories, a song that had often tormented her, given the same name as her. The voice that sang was no longer reminiscent of her mother, but the voices of children who she had often played with growing up. They called back the memories, even though it had been years since she started this live, even though she was happy in this life, the call of these memories was too loud.<br/><br/>Suddenly, she was falling back into them and sleep evaded her again. She was watching herself in her family's embrace while Inuyasha was pulled back into the well, looking as startled as she had felt. The memories of that moment, those feelings, were still so strong. The feeling of heartbreak and sorrow welled up again though it had been so long since she had felt like she had been ripped away from everything that mattered to her.<br/><br/>Of course her family mattered, and she was happy to be in their arms again. She could never fully, truly describe how she had felt in those days. She still couldn't explain the way she felt split in two, with warring desires to be in both her past and present. She remembered the futile attempts to jump through the well, fingers clawing at the ground in a desperate plea to let her return. The first month home, she didn't sleep so much as she cried.<br/><br/>Elysion had garnished a similar reaction, though it was not so fierce because she didn't know exactly where she had slipped through nor did she know where she could worm her way back. Her explorations were subtle between working her job and trying to settle herself into this life. She had no intentions of staying, no intentions of lingering longer than she needed. And while she didn't try as fiercely as she had when she tried to return to the past, her passion was tenfold because she had no ties to this world. Because she was truly alone… With no hope of anyone to reach her.<br/><br/>In her irrational moments, she thought the Jewel had pulled her back and found a new hell for her to reside in. A new hell that would force her to make a wish, but she remembered very clearly that she had wished it gone forever. That didn't stop her dreams, the times when she woke up in the night sobbing. And those memories of her past were the hardest to deal with, the hardest to forget. Her heart began to race in a panic as she turned in her bed again, her breath became a struggle as she fought against a panic attack induced by her wandering mind this late into the night.<br/><br/>She hated feeling so weak, so afraid.<br/><br/>籠の中の鳥は<br/><br/>Kagome finally pulled herself from bed, her room lit with a pale light that was enough to guide her to the bathroom. She stood before the mirror, the sink running while she stared at her reflection. Raven colored hair covered her face and she felt as bad as she looked. Her first morning in Elysion was similar to this, only she was in worse shape.<br/><br/>She had found a place to sleep, managing to work out a deal with the owner of the building to allow her to stay a small period of time without paying. Perhaps it had been Miroku's influence that allowed her to strike such deals, as the monk was known for his way in charming (or scamming) people into giving them more than enough for the work they had done. The monk had always been that way, since they had first met. He would claim the dwelling of a lord to be haunted when it was not or, claim that they were subject to an attack when they would not be. He would sell his wards and charms for such high prices. It worked practically every time and she wondered why people had been so willing to trust him.<br/><br/>Perhaps it was his smile, or the fact that he was a monk that the people of the past were so willing to crumble. He never preyed on the weak, at least. He always did what was right and he was a symbol of strength to her at times when he would push through everything in order to do what was right. He pushed through the fact that he was dying, that he was cursed, and tried to do something about it rather than wallowing in his fate. He had pushed himself to the limit in the time leading up to their final fight. And she had been glad that they had defeated Naraku before he could become subject to the same fate as his father, and his father before him.<br/><br/>As far as her own charms went, however, she was more fair than her friend and made the deal reasonable. She doubted that anyone in this world would pay a hefty price for an exorcism or banishing demons. They were too technologically advanced for that. But she was clever enough, and smart enough, to make a good deal.<br/><br/>But now, Kagome was in a better place though the look on her face looked the same. Haunted, tired, drained...<br/><br/>A quick glance at a clock on the wall told her that she could try to sleep longer. But she opted out of that, not wanting to face the flashbacks again. She took a shower instead, using the cold water to chase away her demons, to fill her lungs with a sharp intake of breath and force herself awake.<br/><br/>いついつ出やる<br/><br/>It didn't work.<br/><br/>Not in the way she was wanting. The cold water certainly forced the air into her lungs, forced her mind to wake and muscles to seize. A bitter laugh was pulled from her lips as she tilted her head back and found herself remembering more. Today, she wasn't going to escape them so easily. She wasn't going to recover so simply, to recover just because she willed it.<br/><br/>Sometimes, there's no avoiding the thoughts you wanted to. Even when you were certain that you were past them.<br/><br/>Sango would have been a great help in this situation. The demon slayer was her best friend, she would even go as far as to call her the sister that she never had. An older sister who was wise, always had her side when trouble arose. Particularly boy trouble, when such things were rather trivial but it was fun to have a crush and for her friend to be mad on her behalf when Inuyasha made her sad. After all, it had been often that the half-demon would run to his dead lover's side and break her heart more than once.<br/><br/>But, Sango also inspired her in other ways. After all the woman had faced, she had always been so strong, so sure... Even in the times that she had doubted herself, she always pulled through. She admired that she had the ability to survive after losing her whole family -- the reminder of this often pushed Kagome to survive, because she lost everyone to this world -- and then having her brother become a pawn of Naraku. It wasn't easy, couldn't have been something to that just anyone could face and still go forward with. She still smiled, even with that pain and those reminders... She was often so bright, even in the darker times.<br/><br/>And right now, she wanted to lean into the older woman's side, to take comfort in the fact that she was there and she was supportive. She felt that Sango would somehow pull through this, and offer some words of strength and understanding. It was times like these that made these spells worse, the constant reminder that she was without her family.<br/><br/>"I don't want to be alone." She cried aloud in her solitude, the sound of the shower drowning out the plea.<br/><br/>She wasn't afraid to admit it.<br/><br/>夜明けの晩に<br/><br/>Another hour had slipped by before she had realized it. Her skin was cold from the water and it felt like ice ran through her veins. She hadn't realized she had begun to shiver until her hand reached to turn off the water and end her shower. Kagome didn't seek her own gaze in the mirror again, instead, she wrapped herself in towels and trudged out of the bathroom, up the stairs and into her kitchen. She started on making a light breakfast, idly reading through her notes for the day as the food cooked.<br/><br/>Her career was really taking off these last years. Her photos were featured in many galleries, her name started to frequent many lips for those who were interested in photography.<br/><br/>The job she had asked for on a whim had sparked it all. She had been far more lucky than she had expected to be in this world. Never lucky enough to slip back through the cracks into her own world, but lucky enough to do well. As she turned back to the stove, she remembered the time she had finally given up on returning home. It was about two years into her life here, as she had started to venture into photography as more than just a hobby but something she could make a name for herself with.<br/><br/>That day had been particularly pleasant, the sun was high in the sky and she had found herself taking some photos of the natural scenery. A little boy had hidden in one of the plants, and she had caught a picture of the moment his face had settled into a cheerful, mischievous grin the moment before he had jumped out to startle his prey. It reminded her of Shippou, the little kitsune she had, essentially, adopted. He, too, had been torn from his family when they had first met. His father killed and he was determined to avenge him. While young, he did seem so mature in their first encounters.<br/><br/>Maybe it had been the influence of Inuyasha that allowed the kit to act like a kid again, to be young and whimsical at times while others he was more mature. He offered comfort to her in his own way, and she tried to care for him as she would her own though she had been so young then as well. However, her youth did not stop her from understanding how to tend to him or care for him like her child. Her heart swelled when he smiled, when he had been so happy for his gift of crayons and took the time to make art. She was so proud of each drawing that he had finished that she knew that this was how a mother would feel in such a situation.<br/><br/>The pain that had ripped through her was too much, too sudden. She missed him and wanted to see how much he had grown since she had been gone. She had missed so much...<br/><br/>To spare herself any further pain, any false hopes… She gave up. And focused on bettering herself.<br/><br/>鶴と亀が<br/><br/>Breakfast tasted bland, boring, and inspired. Only after she had finished did she realized she had forgotten to any sort of spices or flavor to the food. It was too late now to remember that much, as her mind was too busy remembering other details of her life that clearly had become more important than her food.<br/><br/>"Sit!"<br/><br/>Of course, nothing happened when she had angrily yelled at one particularly frustrating client that reminded her of the half-demon. He was being particularly stubborn and rude, wanting a photo taken his way rather than letting it work out naturally. You could try to force wild animals to behave how you wanted. But, rarely did anyone succeed with force. Inuyasha wasn't as bad, however. Inuyasha had learned before she had been forced away from him. He had become gentler, more understanding, more mature though there were times he was still childish and cocky.<br/><br/>She remember how red her cheeks had burned, but how she stood her ground and fired him. She told him she refused to work for anyone or with anyone who wanted to twist something beyond it's nature, beyond it's own desires.<br/><br/>She should have compared the man to Naraku rather than Inuyasha. Though her client did not have such extreme intentions. At least the feeling afterwards was a pleasant memory. The freedom of knowing that she had come so far that she could refuse work that she didn't want to do, to be her own person that was independent of others. She could say that she made it at that point. Even though she heard rumors days later with words meant to slander her.<br/><br/>She defended herself righteously, like she did towards the end of her journey. After all, she was the only one who could protect herself in this world.<br/><br/>滑った<br/><br/>Morning light began to creep into her home, reminding her again of the passage of time. Again, she considered the list of things she had to do and debated on where to start. Or, if she should even start at all. With how the day began, she didn't know if she could consider that a great idea. It was doubtful that she would be successful with how lost in herself she was becoming.<br/><br/>She didn't want to mess up her latest work. Because she had done that on a few occasions before. It wasn't pleasant to try and recover from a complete disaster.<br/><br/>Kagome remembered the feeling of her expensive, brand new, camera slipping from her hands. She wasn't prepared to support it, because she had just removed it from her bag. Part of her screamed on the inside. A dramatic, over-the-top, full on scream that she frequently did when she was much, much younger. When she was struggling to make it through middle school while hopping between times. The other part of her had remained frozen in place while her lense completely shattered and the rest of the camera had broken along with it.<br/><br/>Seeing Inuyasha's brother, a full demon, standing before her was the last thing she expected when she had made her way out for her photos. He stood as proud as ever, as tall as ever, as imposing as she remembered. He didn't look fazed at all to be in an entirely different world, though she was never the best at reading his mind. His name on her lips was so potent, that she could remember the tiniest feelings as she did. Her lips were chapped, her mouth felt dry, and the bubbling feeling of anxiety in her stomach made her feel sick.<br/><br/>She didn't want her hopes to be up.<br/><br/>But, she wanted him to be there, even if they were not friends. They were allies, if anything, since they had fought side by side. And something was better than absolutely nothing.<br/><br/>And Kagome had the sense enough not to throw herself at him, to wrap her arms around him in relief that knowing she was not alone. Her camera no longer mattered when she approached him. She remembered that nothing else mattered for days as she spent time with him, not speaking of their world but speaking (or, she was speaking and he simply acknowledged that fact).<br/><br/>When, exactly, she fell for him though… Kagome couldn't recall. It was a subtle thing, just like he was. But she knew the feeling was there. And he let her know that she was not alone in the fact that she had fallen, that feelings had somehow blossomed.<br/><br/>後ろの正面<br/><br/>A feeling of weightlessness overtook her and suddenly her eyes opened while her mind desperately clawed for the last thing she was doing. She didn't recall when she had fallen asleep on her couch, but she knew the last place she had been was on the far too comfortable cushions. She didn't struggle, however, or fight the weightlessness as she was in familiar arms. Her head tilted against Sesshoumaru's chest, taking comfort in the fact that he was here and she wasn't alone.<br/><br/>"Welcome back." His response was a soft hum in acknowledgement. He didn't need to speak much for her to understand his intent, or the rest of what he had to say.<br/><br/>He carried her back to her bed, settled her into it with ease. Her eyes met his and she smiled easily because no more memories drifted back, no more recollections teased at her. No, whenever he was near, she never fell back into those thoughts. He had helped, and the years had helped. Today was just… One of those days.<br/><br/>"Sleep." He commanded with ease, her eyes rolled at him but she did not fight because she was tired. Her hand clung tightly to him, while she felt his opposite hand press to her forehead in assessment of her wellbeing.<br/><br/>"I'm okay," she said, her words firm with her promise.<br/><br/>She was okay. She was alive. And she was happy.<br/><br/>だあれ<br/><br/>shipper<br/><br/>summary<br/><br/>Kagome, at one point in her life, was a rather regular teenage girl until she was attacked by a demon inside her family's well house. The demon dragged her down into the well, which magically transported her about 500 years into the past. There, she learned that a sacred jewel was encased inside her body as she was the reincarnation of a priestess that had died 50 years prior to the time she was dragged into. The jewel was ripped from her body and the demon that dragged her through time was defeated by the half-demon that she freed who was pinned to the tree. Kagome befriended the half-demon, Inuyasha, in time and traveled with him to restore the jewel that she, herself, shattered. Though it was not so straightforward and easy to do as many demons and humans sought the jewel for their own purposes. She befriended a young kitsune demon, a monk, and a demon slayer who all traveled with her to restore the jewel.<br/><br/>Her group, however, was not the one to complete the jewel. Instead, an evil half-demon who manipulated the majority of the major events in most of her companion's lives. When he finally collected all the pieces of the jewel and made his wish on the tainted object, Kagome was drawn into the jewel itself with the intent of her making a selfish wish to keep her trapped inside forever, keeping the jewel alive. It was the stubbornness of Inuyasha that managed to save her from the darkness. In the end, she returned to her natural time, finished high school as was expect from a girl of her timeline. Though days later, Kagome ended up in Elysion. She has been in this world for five years, and has long since given up on returning home. She's settled happily into her new life.<br/><br/>platonic<br/><br/>It's rather easy for Kagome to make new friends, she hasn't changed much from her youth. She is a cheerful young woman who is empathetic and welcoming to most of all in her life. In her youth, she befriended demons when most would fear them. Even demons that used to eat humans, she has befriended and she changed their ways (she'd like to think). This being said, it's really easy to become her friend as long as someone is able to shown that they are willing to be redeemed, or show that they are not completely evil. She feels greatly for everyone she meets, so it's hard for her not to be drawn to others in a desire to be friends.<br/><br/>antagonistic<br/><br/>The only way to earn Kagome's wrath is to be so deplorable, so evil, and so far beyond redemption that she can't see any good in you. And she can see the good in pretty much everyone and everything. Honestly, with whom she has faced? A half-demon that pitted two lovers against each other, that cursed the entire male line of one of her friends, and then had her best friend's brother kill their family… Yeah, I don't see her hating anyone without them really, really working for it. Feel free to give it a shot, though.<br/><br/>romantic<br/><br/>When in love, Kagome is a strong support, always staying there even when things may be rough. However, Kagome is not looking for love, wasn't looking for love when she arrived so any past relationships don't exist. This isn't to say that someone hasn't fallen in love with her. She can definitely be the subject of someone's unrequited love, she'll probably be oblivious about it, though. Finally, Kagome is currently engaged to Sesshoumaru, surprisingly. I'm totally open to potential AU things, though. <3<br/><br/>fandom hell<br/><br/>age ancient<br/><br/>species space queen<br/><br/>occupation dying<br/><br/>prefers she/her<br/><br/>awards<br/><br/>pro<br/>she/her est 62woo i suck at plot replies. but ok anyway!!! neptune is very friendly and has that 'cool' persona, he's really fun to be around, and he's SUPER good to work with. like he's super patient and he'll do anything she asks of him--he's really easy to work with, definitely in comparison to other models. so i love the idea of them being all work oriented friends at first and then turning into something more. neptune definitely tries to surround himself with people, because he loves having friends, and kagome is pretty much his type too? like she's sweet and she's a strong woman, and he is actually better friends with women than he is with men, idk why, he just loves being surrounded by female friends who knows. i love my guys being super good friends and protecting their girl friends honestly. but oh M A N i love pseduo-family type relationships and neptune is an only child, so he hasn't had any like, familial relationships like that. so her looking out for him all big sister like would make him be like ????? cause he's confused but also he actually really likes that LOL! they're both good kids, i think they'd be really fun ^^<br/><br/>fandom fire emblem: fates<br/><br/>age ninteen<br/><br/>species Part human / part dragon<br/><br/>occupation representative guardian<br/><br/>prefers she/her<br/><br/>awards<br/><br/>yonder<br/>she/her aest 20 posts<br/><br/>I haven't seen Inuyasha at all but... from what I've read Kagome seems to be one of those people who might be able to help Corrin out with her emotional state.

Frankly she hasn't worked through everything yet since she was essentially at the head of a full-scale war.

You know, she's also a singer/performer at a local theater so I can imagine Kagome going there to scope things out and then catching Elsa backstage or something--and then the friendship could blossom from there!

Tamén pode sentir auras demoníacas así como auras malignas. Con todo, cando naceu e creceu, os seus poderes foron selados e era moito menos poderosa. Desde a derrota do que selou os seus poderes, Kagome alcanzou o seu pleno potencial.<br/><br/>PURIFICACIÓN Ao facer unha conexión física, Kagome ten a capacidade de purificar tanto o veleno como a escuridade dun suxeito (vivo e inanimado). Para facelo, proxecta os seus poderes espirituais a través da súa man.<br/><br/>Co seu pleno potencial, Kagome ten a habilidade de crear unha barreira arredor de si mesma e expandila arredor doutros. É unha barreira en forma de cúpula que pode destruír demos débiles que fan contacto coa barreira.<br/><br/>MEJORAR A VISUALIZACIÓN<br/>Kagome ten a capacidade de ver cousas que a miúdo son invisibles para o ollo humano: pantasmas, espíritos, auras divinas e malvadas.<br/><br/>Habilidades con armas<br/>Kagome ten a habilidade de usar un arco e unha frecha. Foi auto-adestrada, e despois de anos de práctica, a súa frecha raramente perde a súa marca. Xunto con isto, Kagome ten a habilidade de infundir as súas frechas con poderes. Pode infundir unha frecha cos seus poderes espirituais que lles permite penetrar forzas demoníacas, destruír feitizos e purificar obxectos. Pode infundir o seu arco cos seus poderes e desviar os ataques inimigos. Ela ten a capacidade de infundir as súas frechas con enerxía purificadora para purificar o veleno, así como poderosos e distantes ataques demoníacos. E, finalmente, ten a habilidade de eludir aos demais coa súa frecha: se o seu obxectivo está detrás dunha barreira ou dun refén, a frecha pode teletransportarse e golpear só o seu obxectivo.<br/><br/>O resto das súas habilidades fixéronse pouco importantes, xa que están relacionadas coa viaxe no tempo (a través do Pozo do Comedor de Ósos), a Xoia de Shikon, ou a súa encarnación anterior.<br/><br/>O canon<br/><br/>Kagome foi retirada uns días despois da súa graduación do instituto, con todo, antes de que o Pozo do Comedor de Ósos se abrise de novo para permitirlle volver ao pasado permanentemente.<br/><br/>Estilo libre<br/><br/>memorias<br/><br/>かごめ<br/><br/>O son do seu nome era un suave susurro na parte de atrás da súa mente, como unha chamada amortiguada polo vento. Era o son dunha memoria distante, unha voz que comezara a esquecer pero que se aferraba desesperadamente a todo o mesmo. Era a voz da súa nai, retorcida no pesar da súa filla perdida. Despois de todo, Kagome desterrada sen deixar rastro. Recordou vividamente aqueles momentos, o xeito en que comezara o día, o que tiña para o almorzo e a última cousa que lle dixera á súa nai. Esas lembranzas eran inquietantes, porque era como calquera outra vez que ela escorregara entre mundos. Espertara, desesperada, porque non tiña ningún propósito fóra da escola. Ela podía atopar un traballo, e estaba programada para unha entrevista ese día. O seu corazón non estaba nel, pero era o que tiña que facer.<br/><br/>Lembrou a sensación de medo, chupándoa e dándolle unha charla animada de que podería facer isto. Que podería progresar na vida que estaba destinada a agora que as cousas estaban resoltas no pasado. Por suposto, tiña a sensación persistente de que xa non pertencía ao seu propio tempo ou á súa propia vida. Non con todo o que deixara atrás.<br/><br/>Kagome lembrou a sensación da madeira baixo os seus dedos, a forma en que a súa man se enrolara no mango para abrir a porta. Lembrou que fixo unha pausa, dirixíndose á súa nai cun sorriso brillante e vibrante mentres se sacudía do seu estupor. "Estou despegando." Lembrou o forte que soaba a súa voz, o sorriso nos labios da súa nai mentres os seus ollos brillaban de orgullo. A súa nai dixo adeus, que non parecía diferente do que antes, pero dalgún xeito o peso das palabras se fixo máis pesado sobre os ombros de Kagome máis ela reflectiu.<br/><br/>Brevemente, os pensamentos parpadearon cara adiante, preguntándose se a súa nai estaba preocupada por ela, se a botaba de menos como ela. Kagome podía admitir abertamente que a forza da súa nai, o seu apoio ao feito de que a súa filla escorregaba polo tempo tan frecuentemente. Houbo momentos en que ela pensou que era débil por non ter a muller para apoiarse.<br/><br/>Con todo, lembrou que reuniu unha pequena cantidade de forza. Podía lembrar o cambio no aire, a temperatura notablemente diferente do que esperaba, parpadeando no entorno repentino e descoñecido. Non era o santuario da súa familia. E cando se virou para volver, para escapar pola porta pola que entrara, atopouse cun metal descoñecido e frío baixo a punta dos dedos e un interior que non era a entrada da súa casa. Un home estaba diante dela, detrás dun mostrador, que a mirou con ollos tan anchos como os seus.<br/><br/>Non entrou en pánico, polo menos, sendo desgarrada polo tempo e colocada en situacións imposíbeis, polo menos construíu a súa forza de vontade en canto a acontecementos estraños. Porque non era todos os días que alguén se atopaba arrastrado ao pasado por un demo, coa intención de arrancar unha poderosa xoia do seu corpo que nin sequera sabían que estaba alí. E logo estaba o feito de que ela rompeu esa poderosa xoia en quen sabe cantas pezas e foi encargado de atopalos. Tales cousas non eran normais, e ela tiña que encadrarse e rodar con el unha vez que ela decatouse de que era a súa realidade. Parecía tan sinxelo, só recoller os fragmentos e fixar a xoia.<br/><br/>Pero non fora doado, había moitos demos tras os anacos e a propia xoia e un demo particularmente poderoso cun desexo que estaba decidido a ver cumprido. Ata o día de hoxe, ela nunca aprendera o seu desexo, pero sabía que nunca fora concedido, mesmo unha vez que tiña a cousa explosiva completada. El arruinara tantas vidas para o ben de nada. Arruinou tantas vidas para unha tarefa tan inútil. Naraku fora o inimigo máis difícil, e o que fora o centro de todo o que saíra mal en todas as vidas da súa amiga.<br/><br/>Pero, era esa imprevisibilidade, esa necesidade de rodar co que estaba a suceder e a forza de vontade que gañara da súa aventura que ela lembrou debuxar para chegar a unha historia que encaixaba no momento que non parecía demasiado caprichoso ou lonxe buscado. Necesitaba ser creída, necesitaba sobrevivir.<br/><br/>Despois de todo, enfrontouse peor que un home nunha tenda de cámaras. Ela mentira entre os dentes para salvar a súa vida antes.<br/><br/>"Eu estaba buscando un traballo." Ao final, non era unha mentira completa. Despois de todo, ela fora da súa casa coa intención de asistir a unha entrevista de traballo. O seu estado de vestiario, polo menos, confirmaría iso moito. Foi unha das fibs máis fáciles que xamais dixera.<br/><br/>E, por algunha razón, ese home tolo a contratou.<br/><br/>かごめ<br/><br/>Kagomed xirou na súa cama mentres empurraba os recordos distantes, negándose a recoñecer que estaba realmente esperta. Ela agarrouse aos últimos ollos do sono, rogándolle que volvese e que a levase de volta no seu abrazo. Pechou os ollos, querendo durmir e só se atopou con recordos. Os ecos dunha canción cantaban na distancia das súas lembranzas, unha canción que moitas veces a atormentara, dado o mesmo nome que ela. A voz que cantaba xa non recordaba á súa nai, senón as voces dos nenos cos que a miúdo xogaba a medrar. Chamaron de volta os recordos, a pesar de que pasaran anos desde que comezou esta vida, a pesar de que era feliz nesta vida, a chamada destes recordos era demasiado forte.<br/><br/>De súpeto, ela estaba caendo de novo neles eo sono evadiu de novo. Ela estaba vendo a si mesma no abrazo da súa familia, mentres Inuyasha foi tirado de volta para o pozo, mirando tan asustada como sentira. As lembranzas dese momento, eses sentimentos, aínda eran tan fortes. A sensación de desgosto e tristeza aflorou de novo, aínda que pasara tanto tempo desde que sentira que fora arrancada de todo o que lle importaba.<br/><br/>Por suposto, a súa familia importaba, e ela estaba feliz de estar nos seus brazos de novo. Ela nunca podería totalmente, realmente describir como se sentira naqueles días. Aínda non podía explicar a forma en que se sentía dividida en dous, con desexos guerreiros de estar tanto no seu pasado como no seu presente. Lembrou os futiles intentos de saltar a través do pozo, os dedos garrando ao chan nunha súplica desesperada para deixala volver. O primeiro mes na casa, ela non durmía tanto como choraba.<br/><br/>Elysion tivera unha reacción similar, aínda que non era tan feroz porque non sabía exactamente por onde se deslizara nin sabía onde podería verme o seu camiño de volta. As súas exploracións foron sutís entre traballar o seu traballo e tratar de asentarse nesta vida. Non tiña intencións de quedarse, nin intencións de demorarse máis do que necesitaba. E aínda que non o intentou tan ferozmente como cando intentou volver ao pasado, a súa paixón era dez veces maior porque non tiña vínculos con este mundo. Porque estaba realmente soa... sen esperanza de que ninguén a alcanzara.<br/><br/>Nos seus momentos irracionais, pensou que a Xoia a puxera de volta e atopou un novo inferno para ela residir. Un novo inferno que a obrigaría a facer un desexo, pero lembrou moi claramente que desexara que desaparecese para sempre. Iso non impediu que os seus soños, as veces que espertaba na noite chorando, e aqueles recordos do seu pasado eran os máis difíciles de tratar, os máis difíciles de esquecer. O seu corazón comezou a correr en pánico como ela virou-se na súa cama de novo, o seu alento converteuse nunha loita como ela loitou contra un ataque de pánico inducido pola súa mente errante tan tarde na noite.<br/><br/>Ela odiaba sentirse tan débil, tan asustada.<br/><br/>籠の中の鳥は<br/><br/>Kagome finalmente saíu da cama, o seu cuarto iluminado cunha luz pálida que era suficiente para guiala ao baño. Ela estaba diante do espello, o lavatorio correndo mentres miraba o seu reflexo. O pelo de corvo cubriu a súa cara e ela sentíase tan mal como parecía. A súa primeira mañá en Elysion foi semellante a isto, só que estaba en peor forma.<br/><br/>Atopou un lugar para durmir, logrando chegar a un acordo co propietario do edificio para permitirlle permanecer un pequeno período de tempo sen pagar. Quizais fose a influencia de Miroku a que lle permitise facer tales acordos, xa que o monxe era coñecido polo seu xeito de encantar (ou estafar) á xente para darlles máis que suficiente para o traballo que fixeran. O monxe sempre fora así, desde que se coñeceran por primeira vez. Reclamaba que a morada dun señor estaba atormentada cando non o era ou, reclamaba que estaban suxeitos a un ataque cando non o serían. Vendía os seus barrios e encantos por prezos tan altos. Funcionou practicamente todas as veces e preguntouse por que a xente estaba tan disposta a confiar nel.<br/><br/>Quizais era o seu sorriso, ou o feito de que era un monxe que a xente do pasado estaba tan disposta a desmoronarse. Nunca se aproveitou dos débiles, polo menos. Sempre fixo o que era correcto e era un símbolo de forza para ela ás veces cando empuxaba a través de todo para facer o que era correcto. El empuxou a través do feito de que estaba morrendo, que estaba maldito, e intentou facer algo sobre iso en vez de baleirarse no seu destino. El empuxouse a si mesmo ao límite no tempo que conduciu á súa loita final. E ela estaba contenta de que derrotaran a Naraku antes de que puidese ser suxeito ao mesmo destino que o seu pai, e o seu pai antes que el.<br/><br/>Con todo, no que respecta aos seus propios encantos, era máis xusta que a súa amiga e facía o trato razoable. Dubidaba de que alguén neste mundo pagaría un alto prezo por un exorcismo ou por desterrar demos. Eran demasiado avanzados tecnoloxicamente para iso. Pero ela era intelixente o suficiente, e intelixente o suficiente, para facer un bo negocio.<br/><br/>Pero agora, Kagome estaba nun lugar mellor aínda que a mirada na súa cara parecía o mesmo. Perseguido, canso, drenado...<br/><br/>Unha ollada rápida a un reloxo na parede díxolle que podería tentar durmir máis tempo. Pero ela optou por non facelo, non querendo enfrontarse aos flashbacks de novo. Tomou unha ducha no seu lugar, usando a auga fría para afastar os seus demos, para encher os seus pulmóns cunha forte inxestión de alento e forzarse a si mesma esperta.<br/><br/>いついつ出やる<br/><br/>Non funcionou.<br/><br/>Non do xeito que ela quería. A auga fría certamente forzou o aire nos seus pulmóns, forzou a súa mente a espertar e os músculos a agarrar. Unha risa amarga tirouse dos seus beizos mentres inclinaba a cabeza cara atrás e atopouse lembrando máis. Hoxe, non ía fuxir deles tan facilmente. Non ía recuperarse tan sinxelo, recuperarse só porque o quixo.<br/><br/>Ás veces, non se evitan os pensamentos que se quere, mesmo cando se está seguro de que pasou por diante deles.<br/><br/>Sango tería sido unha gran axuda nesta situación. A asasina de demos era a súa mellor amiga, incluso chegaría a chamala a irmá que nunca tivo. Unha irmá maior que era sabia, sempre tivo o seu lado cando xurdiron problemas. Particularmente os problemas dos nenos, cando tales cousas eran bastante triviais, pero era divertido ter unha paixón e para a súa amiga estar enfadada no seu nome cando Inuyasha a fixo triste. Despois de todo, foi moitas veces que o medio demo ía correr ao lado do seu amante morto e romper o seu corazón máis dunha vez.<br/><br/>Pero Sango tamén a inspirou doutras maneiras. Despois de todo o que a muller enfrontara, ela sempre fora tan forte, tan segura... Mesmo nos momentos en que dubidara de si mesma, sempre se saíu adiante. Admiraba que tiña a capacidade de sobrevivir despois de perder a toda a súa familia - o recordo diso a miúdo empurrou a Kagome a sobrevivir, porque perdeu a todos a este mundo - e logo ter o seu irmán convertido nun peón de Naraku. Non era doado, non podía ser algo que só calquera podía afrontar e seguir adiante. Aínda sorria, aínda con esa dor e eses recordos... A miúdo era tan brillante, mesmo nos tempos máis escuros.<br/><br/>E agora mesmo, ela quería apoiarse no lado da muller maior, para sentirse confortada polo feito de que estaba alí e apoiaba. Ela sentía que Sango dalgún xeito superaría isto, e ofrecería algunhas palabras de forza e comprensión. Eran momentos como estes os que empeoraban estes feitizos, o recordatorio constante de que estaba sen a súa familia.<br/><br/>"Eu non quero estar só." Ela gritou en voz alta na súa soidade, o son da ducha afogando a súplica.<br/><br/>Non tiña medo de admitilo.<br/><br/>夜明けの晩に<br/><br/>Pasara outra hora antes de que se decatase. A súa pel estaba fría da auga e sentía como se o xeo correse polas súas veas. Non se dera conta de que comezara a tremer ata que a súa man chegou para apagar a auga e rematar a ducha. Kagome non buscou a súa propia mirada no espello de novo, en cambio, envolto en toallas e saíu do baño, subiu as escaleiras e na súa cociña. Comezou a facer un almorzo lixeiro, lendo ociosamente as súas notas para o día mentres a comida se cociñaba.<br/><br/>A súa carreira foi realmente despegando estes últimos anos. As súas fotos foron presentadas en moitas galerías, o seu nome comezou a frecuentar moitos beizos para aqueles que estaban interesados na fotografía.<br/><br/>O traballo que pedira por un capricho o desencadeara todo. Tivera moito máis sorte do que esperaba estar neste mundo. Nunca a sorte de volver a través das fisuras no seu propio mundo, pero a sorte de facelo ben. Cando volveu á estufa, lembrou o tempo que finalmente renunciara a volver a casa. Pasou uns dous anos na súa vida aquí, xa que comezara a aventurarse na fotografía como algo máis que un pasatempo, pero algo que podería facer un nome para si mesma.<br/><br/>Aquel día fora particularmente agradable, o sol estaba alto no ceo e ela atopouse tomando algunhas fotos do escenario natural. Un neno agochouse nunha das plantas, e ela capturou unha foto do momento en que a súa cara se asentou nun alegre, malicioso sorriso o momento antes de que el saltara para asustar a súa presa. Lembráballe a Shippou, o pequeno kitsune que adoptara, esencialmente. El tamén fora arrancado da súa familia cando se coñeceron por primeira vez. O seu pai matouno e estaba decidido a vingalo. Cando era novo, parecía tan maduro nos seus primeiros encontros.<br/><br/>Quizais fora a influencia de Inuyasha o que permitiu ao kit actuar como un neno de novo, para ser novo e caprichoso ás veces mentres que outros era máis maduro. Ofrecéulle consolo á súa maneira, e ela tratou de coidar del como ela coidaría dela, aínda que ela fora tan nova entón tamén. Con todo, a súa mocidade non lle impediu entender como coidar del ou coidalo como o seu fillo. O seu corazón inchou cando sorriu, cando estaba tan feliz polo seu agasallo de lapis e tomou o tempo para facer arte. Ela estaba tan orgullosa de cada debuxo que terminara que ela sabía que así era como se sentiría unha nai en tal situación.<br/><br/>A dor que a atravesara era demasiado, demasiado súbita. Faltoulle e quería ver canto medrara desde que desaparecera. Faltoulle tanto...<br/><br/>Para evitar máis dor, máis falsas esperanzas, renunciou e concentrouse en mellorarse.<br/><br/>鶴と亀が<br/><br/>O almorzo tiña un sabor insípido, aburrido e inspirado. Só despois de rematar se deu conta de que esquecera calquera tipo de especias ou sabor para a comida. Xa era demasiado tarde para lembrar iso, xa que a súa mente estaba demasiado ocupada para lembrar outros detalles da súa vida que claramente se fixeran máis importantes que a súa comida.<br/><br/>"Senta!"<br/><br/>Por suposto, non pasou nada cando berrou con rabia a un cliente particularmente frustrante que lle lembraba o medio demo. El estaba sendo particularmente teimoso e groseiro, querendo unha foto tomada o seu camiño en vez de deixalo funcionar naturalmente. Poderías tentar forzar aos animais salvaxes a comportarse como queiras. Pero, raramente alguén tivo éxito coa forza. Inuyasha non era tan malo, con todo. Inuyasha aprendera antes de que fose forzada a afastarse del. Fíxose máis amable, máis comprensivo, máis maduro, aínda que houbo momentos en que aínda era infantil e arrogante.<br/><br/>Lembra o vermello que queimaran as súas meixelas, pero como se mantivo firme e o despediu. Díxolle que se negaba a traballar para calquera ou con calquera que quixese torcer algo máis aló da súa natureza, máis aló dos seus propios desexos.<br/><br/>Ela debería ter comparado o home con Naraku en vez de Inuyasha. Aínda que o seu cliente non tiña tales intencións extremas. Polo menos o sentimento despois foi un recordo agradable. A liberdade de saber que chegara tan lonxe que podía rexeitar un traballo que non quería facer, de ser a súa propia persoa que era independente dos demais. Aínda que escoitou rumores días despois con palabras destinadas a calumniala.<br/><br/>Defendeuse con xustiza, como o fixo cara ao final da súa viaxe. Despois de todo, ela era a única que podía protexerse a si mesma neste mundo.<br/><br/>滑った<br/><br/>A luz da mañá comezou a penetrar na súa casa, recordándolle de novo o paso do tempo. De novo, ela considerou a lista de cousas que tiña que facer e debateu sobre por onde comezar. Ou, se ata comezar en absoluto. Coa forma en que comezou o día, ela non sabía se podería considerar que unha gran idea. Era dubidoso que ía ter éxito con o perdido en si mesma estaba a converterse.<br/><br/>Non quería estragar o seu último traballo, porque xa o fixera en algunhas ocasións, non era agradable tentar recuperarse dun desastre completo.<br/><br/>Kagome lembrou a sensación da súa cara, nova, cámara deslizando das súas mans. Ela non estaba preparada para soportalo, porque acababa de retiralo da súa bolsa. Parte dela berrou no interior. Un dramático, over-the-top, cheo de berros que ela facía con frecuencia cando era moito, moito máis novo. Cando ela estaba loitando para chegar ata o ensino medio mentres saltaba entre as veces. A outra parte dela quedara conxelada no seu lugar mentres a súa lente rompíase completamente e o resto da cámara rompíase con ela.<br/><br/>Ver o irmán de Inuyasha, un demo completo, de pé diante dela foi a última cousa que ela esperaba cando saíra para as súas fotos. El estaba tan orgulloso como sempre, tan alto como sempre, tan imponente como ela lembraba. Non parecía avergoñado de estar nun mundo completamente diferente, aínda que ela nunca foi a mellor en ler a súa mente. O seu nome nos seus beizos era tan potente, que podía lembrar os máis pequenos sentimentos como ela. Os seus beizos estaban agrietados, a súa boca sentíase seca, ea sensación de burbulla de ansiedade no seu estómago facía sentir mal.<br/><br/>Ela non quería que as súas esperanzas se puxeran en marcha.<br/><br/>Pero ela quería que estivera alí, aínda que non fosen amigos. Eran aliados, en todo caso, xa que loitaran lado a lado. E algo era mellor que absolutamente nada.<br/><br/>E Kagome tivo o sentido suficiente para non lanzarse a el, para envolver os seus brazos en torno a el con alivio de que sabendo que non estaba só. A súa cámara xa non importaba cando ela se achegou a el. Lembrou que nada máis importaba durante días, xa que pasaba tempo con el, non falando do seu mundo, senón falando (ou, ela estaba falando e el simplemente recoñeceu ese feito).<br/><br/>Cando, exactamente, ela caeu por el, pero... Kagome non podía lembrar. Era unha cousa sutil, como el estaba. Pero ela sabía que o sentimento estaba alí. E deixoulle saber que ela non estaba só no feito de que ela caera, que os sentimentos floreceran dalgún xeito.<br/><br/>後ろの正面<br/><br/>Unha sensación de ingravidez apoderouse dela e de súpeto os seus ollos abríronse mentres a súa mente garraba desesperadamente pola última cousa que estaba facendo. Non lembraba cando durmía no seu sofá, pero sabía que o último lugar onde estivera estaba nas almofadas demasiado cómodas. Non loitaba, con todo, nin loitaba contra a ingravidez, xa que estaba en brazos familiares. A súa cabeza inclinouse contra o peito de Sesshoumaru, confortándose no feito de que estaba aquí e ela non estaba soa.<br/><br/>"Benvido de volta." A súa resposta foi un zumbido suave en recoñecemento. El non precisaba falar moito para que ela entendese a súa intención, ou o resto do que tiña que dicir.<br/><br/>Levouna de volta á súa cama, colocándoa nela con facilidade. Os seus ollos atopábanse cos seus e ela sorriu facilmente porque non había máis recordos á deriva, non había máis recordos que se burlaran dela. Non, cada vez que estaba preto, ela nunca volvía a caer neses pensamentos. El axudara, e os anos axudaran. Hoxe foi só... un deses días.<br/><br/>"Dormir." El ordenou con facilidade, os seus ollos rolou para el, pero ela non loitou porque estaba cansa. A súa man agarrouse firmemente a el, mentres ela sentiu a presión da súa man oposta á súa fronte en avaliación do seu benestar.<br/><br/>"Estou ben", dixo, as súas palabras firmes coa súa promesa.<br/><br/>Estaba ben, estaba viva e feliz.<br/><br/>だあれ<br/><br/>shipper<br/><br/>resumo<br/><br/>Kagome, nalgún momento da súa vida, era unha adolescente bastante regular ata que foi atacada por un demo dentro da casa do pozo da súa familia. O demo a arrastrou cara ao pozo, o que a transportou máxicamente uns 500 anos ao pasado. Alí, aprendeu que unha xoia sagrada estaba encerrada dentro do seu corpo, xa que era a reencarnación dunha sacerdotisa que morrera 50 anos antes do momento no que foi arrastrada. A xoia foi arrancada do seu corpo e o demo que a arrastrou a través do tempo foi derrotado polo medio demo que ela liberou que foi preso á árbore. Kagome fixo amizade co medio demo, Inuyasha, no tempo e viaxou con el para restaurar a xoia que ela mesma rompeu, aínda que non era tan sinxelo e fácil de facer como moitos demos e humanos buscaron a xoia para os seus propios propósitos. Ela fixo amizade cun novo demo kitsune, un monxe, e un asasino de demos que viaxou con ela para restaurar a xoia.<br/><br/>O seu grupo, con todo, non foi o que completou a xoia, senón un medio demo malvado que manipulou a maioría dos acontecementos importantes na maior parte da vida da súa compañeira. Cando finalmente recolleu todas as pezas da xoia e fixo o seu desexo no obxecto contaminado, Kagome foi atraída para a propia xoia coa intención de que fixera un desexo egoísta de mantela atrapada dentro para sempre, mantendo a xoia viva. Foi a teimosía de Inuyasha o que conseguiu salvala da escuridade. Ao final, volveu ao seu tempo natural, terminou a escola secundaria como se esperaba dunha rapaza da súa liña temporal. Aínda que días despois, Kagome acabou en Elysion. Estivo neste mundo durante cinco anos, e desde hai moito que renunciou a volver a casa.<br/><br/>platónicos<br/><br/>É bastante doado para Kagome facer novos amigos, ela non cambiou moito desde a súa mocidade. Ela é unha moza alegre que é empática e benvida a sobre todo na súa vida. Na súa mocidade, fixo amizade cos demos cando a maioría lles temería.

Dito isto, é realmente fácil converterse no seu amigo sempre que alguén sexa capaz de demostrar que está disposto a ser redimido, ou demostrar que non son completamente malvados.

| Why You Should be on Twitter<br/><br/>Disclaimer: I am not, nor have I ever claimed to be, a social media guru. I'm just a person who thinks about stuff a lot, and this has come up a number of times.<br/><br/>I'm not an early adopter. Sometimes it takes me years to figure out what I want to use something for before I actually get on it, and Twitter was one of those things. I've been on Twitter seriously since about February of this year, so I'm pretty new at it. Still, I've learned a number of things, and I wanted to share them. Some people say I'm a Twitter pusher, and I am, because there's lots of good reasons to get on it, and virtually no downsides.<br/><br/>So what's Twitter? If you're on the internet, you've probably at least heard of it. It's a social media network that serves as a forum for conversations, updates, and news in a medium more public than something like Facebook or LinkedIn. Facebook is about who wants to find you, but Twitter is about who you want to find. Your favourite writers, actors, politicians, singers, and scientists are probably on Twitter. So are your favourite charities, radio stations, news sites, and stores. And they want you to find them and listen to what they have to say. Everyone on Twitter, at least initially, wants to talk with you.<br/><br/>But why join that? Why be a part of it? There's all kinds of reasons, and I'm going to give you a few.<br/><br/>People and Places Twitter is a great way to find out about events which are going on around the world, but also in your community. If you're travelling and looking for things to do, it's a great way to find out about things relevant to your interests (because the people you follow are people you're interested in). Even if you're not travelling, knowing about great places to go locally or knowing that people you're interested in are going to them creates an opportunity to meet them and create a deeper relationship with them. If you go back to my party post, all the people in it but two, I heard about on Twitter and then met in real life, and now we're pretty good friends. And the more you do this, the more things you'll find out about, and the more people you'll meet. And if you follow them on Twitter, you already know a bit about what they're like. They want you to. The reverse is also true, because tweeting invites people to see what you're like, and they can make the same choices about you.<br/><br/>Inspiration and Motivation<br/>Inspiration comes from the strangest places, and the influx of tweets means there's always fresh content for your imagination. I have a follow first policy, so I'll follow just about anybody, and then periodically go through and unfollow people. I don't know who's going to plant the seed of a new blog post or new project in me, so I like to keep my options open. Motivation also happens, because Twitter is just like life. If you surround yourself with people who are ambitious, dedicated, generous, and hard-working, it's easier to be like that, and push yourself. It's easier to think that if they can plan events, launch projects, or just get up in the morning, well, so can you.<br/><br/>Learning and Lifestyle Bloggers are on Twitter. Bloggers who aren't may actually be crazy. And people blog about just about everything. If you're looking to learn something, odds are good that somebody's tweeting about it. On top of that, news services and stores are also connected, which means that you can get your news up to the minute, and find out about sales and deals as they start.As far as lifestyle, looking for new recipe ideas? Follow some caterers and see what they come up with. Need a twist for that cocktail party? Twitter's got people for that too. Wardrobe recommendations, or just want to see what other people are doing with their lives? It's all there.<br/><br/>There are some common challenges I face when talking about this, and they're legitimate obstacles. It can seem pretty daunting, especially if you're getting on the bandwagon late, like I did. I spent months following only two people and not knowing what else to do. But there are ways to overcome them, and hear they are from least frequent to most.<br/><br/>#3: Twitter is for Narcissistic Jerks<br/>I think this comes from the idea that most people tweet for and about themselves as a way of getting attention. What I don't get is why there's anything wrong with that, or why doing that makes one a narcissist or a jerk. If someone has something to say, they want to be heard. Used to be you'd stand on the street corner and yell. Now you can yell in 140 characters or less. Twitter's just a new way to be heard. Now, there are certainly narcissistic jerks on Twitter. They're pretty much everywhere. Sometimes, people are jerks. Sometimes one of those people is me, I'm sorry to say. Don't follow those people. If you don't like what someone is saying, whether that's points that they're making or detailed accounts of their bathroom activities, you don't have to listen on Twitter.<br/><br/>#2: I Can't Keep Track of It All<br/>The second obstacle people often bring up is that they just don't have time to keep track of all the things which are going on on Twitter. And you know what? That's fine. Keep track of what you can. Maybe you only wander on every few days. If you're a private user (rather than tweeting for your company), and especially a beginner, that's okay. Part of something is better than all of nothing.<br/><br/>#1 I've Got Nothing I Want to Put Out There<br/>This is by far the most frequent challenge people raise. And it doesn't even matter. You don't have to join Twitter to talk. Join it to listen. Again, your favourite authors, singers, bloggers, and newspapers are on here. This is your chance to listen to them. It's your chance to gain a window into their lives and activities, and they're inviting you to do that. Want to find out what Felicia Day is going to be up to at the San Diego Comic Con? Done. I know people who only listen on Twitter, and that's great. That's what I did for a while. Eventually, maybe you'll find something to tweet about, or make something to tweet about. I hope you do, because I want to hear about it.<br/><br/>In short, if you're not using Twitter, I think you should be. If you're not using it to its full extent, try to. Don't be afraid to follow five hundred people, if all of those people are saying things you're interested in. Invite those people into bits of your life, and see how it's improved by the interaction. I look forward to hearing from you. | Por que deberías estar en Twitter<br/><br/>Descargo de responsabilidade: Non son un gurú das redes sociais. Só son unha persoa que pensa moito nas cousas, e isto apareceu varias veces.<br/><br/>Non son un adoptante temperán. Ás veces levo anos descubrindo para que quero usar algo antes de meterme nel, e Twitter foi unha desas cousas. Estiven en Twitter en serio desde febreiro deste ano, así que son bastante nova nisto. Aínda así, aprendín unha serie de cousas, e quería compartilas. Algunhas persoas din que son un impulsor de Twitter, e así é, porque hai moitas boas razóns para usalo, e practicamente non hai inconvenientes.<br/><br/>Entón, que é Twitter? Se estás en Internet, probablemente escoitaste falar del. É unha rede de redes sociais que serve como un foro para conversas, actualizacións e noticias nun medio máis público que algo como Facebook ou LinkedIn. Facebook é sobre quen quere atoparche, pero Twitter é sobre quen quere atopar. Os seus escritores favoritos, actores, políticos, cantantes e científicos están probablemente en Twitter. Así como as súas organizacións benéficas favoritas, estacións de radio, sitios de noticias e tendas. E queren que os atopes e escoites o que teñen que dicir. Todo o mundo en Twitter, polo menos inicialmente, quere falar contigo.<br/><br/>Pero por que unirse a iso? Por que formar parte diso? Hai todo tipo de razóns, e vouche dar algunhas.<br/><br/>Persoas e lugares Twitter é unha gran forma de descubrir sobre os eventos que están a suceder en todo o mundo, pero tamén na súa comunidade. Se estás viaxando e buscando cousas para facer, é unha gran maneira de descubrir cousas relevantes para os seus intereses (porque as persoas que segues son persoas que están interesados en). Mesmo se non está viaxando, sabendo sobre grandes lugares para ir localmente ou sabendo que as persoas que están interesados van a eles crea unha oportunidade para coñecelos e crear unha relación máis profunda con eles. Se volvedes ao meu post do partido, todas as persoas menos dúas, oín falar dela en Twitter e logo coñecémonos na vida real, e agora somos moi bos amigos. E canto máis fagades isto, máis cousas descubriredes, e máis xente coñeceredes. E se os segues en Twitter, xa sabes un pouco sobre como son. Eles queren que o fagas. O contrario tamén é certo, porque tuitear invita á xente a ver como es, e poden tomar as mesmas decisións sobre ti.<br/><br/>Inspiración e motivación<br/>A inspiración vén dos lugares máis estraños, e a afluencia de tweets significa que sempre hai contido novo para a vosa imaxinación. Teño unha política de primeiro seguir, así que seguirei a case calquera, e despois periodicamente percorrerei e deixarei de seguir á xente. Non sei quen vai plantar a semente dunha nova publicación de blog ou novo proxecto en min, polo que me gusta manter as miñas opcións abertas. A motivación tamén acontece, porque Twitter é como a vida. Se te rodeas de persoas que son ambiciosas, dedicadas, xenerosas e traballadoras, é máis fácil ser así e empurrarte. É máis doado pensar que se poden planificar eventos, lanzar proxectos, ou simplemente levantarse pola mañá, ben, tamén podes.<br/><br/>Os blogueiros de aprendizaxe e estilo de vida están en Twitter. Os blogueiros que non o están poden estar tolos. E a xente bloguea sobre case todo. Se está a buscar aprender algo, as probabilidades son boas de que alguén estea tuiteando sobre iso. Ademais, os servizos de noticias e tendas tamén están conectados, o que significa que pode obter as súas noticias ata o minuto, e aprender sobre vendas e ofertas a medida que comezan. En canto ao estilo de vida, buscando novas ideas de receitas? Siga algúns caterings e ver o que veñen con. Necesita un xiro para ese cóctel? Twitter ten xente para iso tamén. Recomendacións de garda-roupa, ou só quere ver o que outras persoas están facendo coas súas vidas? Está todo aí.<br/><br/>Hai algúns retos comúns aos que me enfronto cando falo disto, e son obstáculos lexítimos. Pode parecer bastante intimidante, especialmente se chegas tarde ao tren, como fixen eu. Pasei meses seguindo só a dúas persoas e sen saber que máis facer. Pero hai maneiras de superalas, e escoitar que son de menos frecuentes a máis.<br/><br/>#3: Twitter é para os idiotas narcisistas<br/>Creo que isto provén da idea de que a maioría da xente tuitea por si mesma e sobre si mesma como unha forma de chamar a atención. O que non entendo é por que hai algo malo niso, ou por que facer iso fai que un sexa un narcisista ou un idiota. Se alguén ten algo que dicir, quere ser escoitado. Adoitaba estar na esquina e berrar. Agora pode berrar en 140 caracteres ou menos. Twitter é só unha nova forma de ser escoitado. Agora, certamente hai idiotas narcisistas en Twitter. Están en todas partes. Ás veces, a xente é idiota. Ás veces, unha desas persoas son eu, síntoo dicir. Non sigas a esa xente. Se non che gusta o que alguén está dicindo, xa sexan os puntos que están facendo ou as contas detalladas das súas actividades de baño, non tes que escoitar en Twitter.<br/><br/>#2 Non podo seguir todo isto<br/>O segundo obstáculo que a xente adoita mencionar é que simplemente non teñen tempo para facer un seguimento de todas as cousas que están a suceder en Twitter. E sabedes que? Está ben. Manter un rexistro do que podes. Quizais só vagues cada poucos días. Se vostede é un usuario privado (en vez de twittear para a súa empresa), e especialmente un principiante, está ben. Parte de algo é mellor que todo de nada.<br/><br/>#1 Non teño nada que poñer alí<br/>Este é de lonxe o reto máis frecuente que a xente plantexa. E nin sequera importa. Non tes que unirte a Twitter para falar. Únete a el para escoitar. De novo, os teus autores favoritos, cantantes, blogueiros e xornais están aquí. Esta é a túa oportunidade de escoitalos. É a túa oportunidade de gañar unha xanela nas súas vidas e actividades, e están a convidarte a facelo. Queres saber o que Felicia Day vai ser na Comic Con de San Diego? Feito. Coñezo xente que só escoita en Twitter, e iso é xenial. Iso foi o que fixen durante un tempo. Eventualmente, quizais atoparás algo sobre o que twittear, ou facer algo sobre o que twittear. Espero que o fagas, porque quero escoitar sobre iso.<br/><br/>En resumo, se non estás a usar Twitter, creo que deberías. Se non o estás a usar en toda a súa extensión, tenta facelo. Non teñas medo de seguir a quinientas persoas, se todas esas persoas están a dicir cousas que che interesan. Convidade a esas persoas a coñecer parte da vosa vida, e vexades como mellora a interacción. Estou desexando escoitar de vós. |
| Root Canals<br/><br/>The very thought of getting a root canal puts most people on edge. SCM Dental utilizes the latest technology and technique to make a root canal a virtually pain free and low stress procedure.<br/><br/>Rotary endodontics is an advanced technology and technique to perform endodontic treatment, the clinical term for a root canalThe term "root canal" refers to the natural cavity at the center of the tooth. The tooth's nerve is located in soft tissue (pulp) inside the root canal. If the tooth is damaged either by trauma or decay, debris can enter the sensitive root canal area and cause an infection, or in extreme circumstances, and abscess. An abscessed tooth is very serious and should be treated as an emergency, as it can create an infection that may spread to other parts of the body. If you believe you have an abscessed tooth, contact our office immediately to schedule emergency care.<br/><br/>Depending on the case, root canal therapy may require more than one visit. An initial x-ray will be taken to evaluate the tooth and root canal and determine the extent of the damage and infection if present. You will be given a form of anesthesia to make you relaxed.<br/><br/>When the area is numb, our dentist will create an access chamber to the root canal using an electric handpiece. Next, the root canal will be scraped of the infected or damaged tissue and nerve. Once the entire area has been throughly cleaned and polished, the tooth will be filled with a biocompatible rubber compound called gutta percha. The tooth is then covered with a dental filling or dental crown to restore strength and function.<br/><br/>Endodontic therapy has a bad reputation as being a painful procedure. With rotary endodontics, a root canal procedure is no more painful than having a dental filling placed. The infection and damage to the nerve is what creates the extreme pain and discomfort and patients you will experience significant relief after undergoing root canal therapy. Root canals have a success rate of 95% and allow people to preserve their natural teeth. | canles raíz<br/><br/>O mesmo pensamento de obter unha canle de raíz pon a maioría das persoas na beira. SCM Dental utiliza a última tecnoloxía e técnica para facer unha canle de raíz un procedemento virtualmente libre de dor e baixo estrés.<br/><br/>A endodoncia rotativa é unha tecnoloxía e técnica avanzadas para realizar tratamentos endodónticos, o termo clínico para unha canle radicular.O termo "canle radicular" refírese á cavidade natural no centro do dente. O nervio do dente está localizado no tecido mol (pulpa) dentro da canle radicular. Se o dente está danado por trauma ou caries, os restos poden entrar na área sensible da canle radicular e causar unha infección, ou en circunstancias extremas, e absceso. Un dente absceso é moi grave e debe ser tratado como unha emerxencia, xa que pode crear unha infección que se pode propagar a outras partes do corpo. Se cre que ten un dente absceso, póñase en contacto coa nosa oficina inmediatamente para programar atención de emerxencia.<br/><br/>Dependendo do caso, a terapia da canle radicular pode requirir máis dunha visita. Tomarase unha radiografía inicial para avaliar o dente e a canle radicular e determinar a extensión do dano e a infección se está presente. Recibirá unha forma de anestesia para relaxarse.<br/><br/>Cando a área está adormecida, o noso dentista creará unha cámara de acceso á canle da raíz usando unha peza de man eléctrica. A continuación, a canle da raíz será raspada do tecido e o nervio infectados ou danados. Unha vez que toda a área foi completamente limpa e pulida, o dente será enchido cun composto de goma biocompatible chamado gutta percha. O dente é entón cuberto cun recheo dental ou coroa dental para restaurar a forza e a función.<br/><br/>A terapia endodóntica ten unha mala reputación como un procedemento doloroso. Con endodoncia rotativa, un procedemento de canal radicular non é máis doloroso que ter un recheo dental colocado. A infección e dano ao nervio é o que crea a dor extrema e malestar e os pacientes experimentarán un alivio significativo despois de someterse a terapia de canal radicular. As canles radiculares teñen unha taxa de éxito do 95% e permiten que as persoas conserven os seus dentes naturais. |
| Churchyard Bottom Wood<br/><br/>Highgate<br/><br/>Churchyard Bottom Wood, Highgate<br/><br/>Now called Queen's Wood<br/><br/>Between 1860 and 1880 the centre was torn out of the City of London to build sewers, railways and new roads. Houses were demolished without regard for the tenants who had to find whatever accommodation they could elsewhere. Managers went to livo in Kensington and St. John's Wood, while the poorest crowded into the rookeries like Seven Dials and Lisson Grove. For those between, the clerks and skilled workmen, speculative builders put up row after row of terraced villas and Mr Pooter moved into Holloway. The people of Muswell Hill watched houses creep across the fields of Finsbury Park, up Crouch Hill and down the other side, so that by 1880, Crouch End was being developed and there seemed no way to stem the flow. Ten years later the large estates of Muswell Hill were being sold. Upton Farm was sold and the Ecclesiastical Commissioners wanted to develop Churchyard Bottom Wood, now called Queen's Wood. The story would have made an Ibsen play. Two groups of honest, highly motivated people fighting for what they each thought was right. The Ecclesiastical Commissioners on the one hand and the Committee of the Hornsey Charities on the other, both believed they were doing their best for other people, and the public rose against them both in indignation<br/><br/>At that time Muswell Hill Road was a country road, with Southwood Hall at one end and Upton Farm at the other. By 1894, Onslow Gardens was built, Connaught Gardens marked out, and builders were poised to develop the Woodlands estate. Cut out of Churchyard Bottom Wood was a group of tumble-down cottages, on a triangular site. An undated map, held by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners shows six Wasteland Cottages with an opening between them - not a road, not metalled, but a way through to the strawberry beds behind. Further along was another gap which led to footpaths through the wood. These two openings were to be the basis of the plan. The same two gaps and the cleared ground, which was the strawberry field, can be seen in the 1894 map below. They are shown as 'Muswell Hill Cottages' and, quite in passing, Peter Sellers was to live on the same site much later on. To develop the wood as a housing estate, the Commissioners needed to drive two roads through from Muswell Hill Road and build houses along them. The Muswell Hill Road frontage alone would not have provided room for enough houses to make the venture worthwhile.<br/><br/>The land and cottages had been given much earlier as almshouses to house old people and were held on their behalf by the Trustees of the Hornsey Charity Commissioners. By the 1890s the cottages were tumble-down, in need of major repair. Public-spirited, wishing to do the best for their old tenants, the Trustees could not improve them since they had no money. Some years before the Ecclesiastical Commissioners had planned to develop Gravel Pit Wood (now Highgate Wood) as a housing estate, but this had met such opposition that they backed down. Instead, in 1886, they gave all 69 acres woodland to the public. At the same time they offered to sell Churchyard Bottom Wood to Hornsey Urban District Council for £25,000, but this was too much for Hornsey to raise on its own. The Council said that people living outside Hornsey also enjoyed the wood and other authorities should help, but no help was given. In the end the offer fell into abeyance.<br/><br/>Map showing the Muswell Hill Cottages which were the centre of the controversy.<br/><br/>Muswell Hill Road about 1880<br/><br/>It seems probable that these three pairs of cottages<br/>were the ones at the centre of the dispute.<br/><br/>The Ecclesiastical Commissioners wanted to raise money for its church work in Britain and abroad. They considered that they had been given the land to be used for the propogat­ion of religion and if this meant selling off land or woods, it was a lesser evil than restricting the work of the church. They had given Gravel Pit Wood to the public: in its place they would develop Churchyard Bottom Wood.<br/><br/>The Trustees of the Hornsey Charities wanted to produce an income to help their poor people, so they made an offer to the Commissioners. Their triangular piece of land was too awkwardly shaped to be developed economically, but if the Commissioners would grant them some more land to make it into a square site, they would build twenty-five neat villas. These would bring in ground rents of £225 per annum, which could be used to relieve the poverty of Hornsey people. In return they would permit the Commission­ers to cut two roads through their land so that the Commissioners could develop the woods.<br/><br/>When this offer became known people immediately reacted with alarm.<br/><br/>On the 16th December 1893 Mr Carvell Williams MP asked in the House of Commons, if the Ecclesiastical Commissioners had consented to sell a strip of land to the Hornsey Charities Trustees on condition that an existing road be widened to 40 feet, whether this was a preliminary to a building scheme and if the House of Parliament would have an opportunity to express an opinion.<br/><br/>Mr Leveson Gower, a Church Estates Commissioner replied',"Yes" to the first part.<br/><br/>Mr Carvell Williams, "Do I understand it is the intention to destroy that portion of Highgate Woods by building on it?"<br/><br/>Two days later The Star published an article worthy of any modern tabloid.<br/><br/>The Star<br/>18th December 1893<br/><br/>'Parliament must keep a keen watch on those old vandals and confederates of the jerry-builder the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. They are always alienating some piece of land or are favouring the builders as opposed to the general public. The Commissioners would not sell the Churchyard Bottom wood to the ratepayers but now propose 'to open it up' by cutting two wide roads through it in connection with one of their numerous building schemes. Will not someone ask a question in Parliament and check the brick and mortar policy of the Commissioners?'<br/><br/>By the time this was printed, the question had been asked and the answer was either untrue, or devious. Other papers took up the story. The Times, in a long report, said that the Comnussioners were not prepared to give an undertaking that Parliament, or any other public body, should have an opportunity of considering any scheme for building on the site of the wood.<br/><br/>The situation simmered for eighteen months until the Ecclesiastical Commissioners were forced to open an enquiry, which began at Highgate on 31 May 1895, chaired by an Assistant Ecclesiastical Commissioner. The Inquiry produced a flurry of newspaper letters of which this was the most important.<br/><br/>The Daily Chronicle, 5 June 1895<br/><br/>VANDALISM AT HIGHGATE<br/><br/>Sir –<br/><br/>One of the most lovely bits of woodland in suburan London is threatened. Will you help us to ward off what would be a calamity, not only to the immediate district, but to the whole of densely-populated North London? In no part of the metropolis has the builder been more active than in Crouch End and Hornsey. The beautiful meadows of a year or two ago are now houses and shops. Ballast heaps have taken the place of stately elms and chestnuts, and once pleasant villages are sharing the fate of Stroud Green, Harringay, Finsbury Park, Highbury and Islington. ---<br/><br/>---- The object is the construction of two forty-foot roads through the woods. We in this district know the meaning of forty-foot roads through woods. It means that the woods are doomed. Ten years ago agitation saved the sister-wood of sixty-five acres - The Gravel Pit Woods - and no one who saw the Bank Holiday crowds flocking up the Archway Road from the dreary streets of Holloway, Islington and Clerkenwell, and watched the keen enjoyment of the children and family parties picnicking on the grass and among the trees, could fail to realise the immense boon that the grant by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners of this wood has been to the whole of North London, but the Lower Wood of sixty acres has always been regarded as a natural complement of the other. ----<br/><br/>--- The Ecclesiastical Commissioners own nearly one-third of the large parish of Hornsey. By the liberal expenditure of the ratepayers' money in the opening up of roads and the general development of the district, the value of their property has been enormously increased, and from this unearned increment they each year draw large revenues. Surely the ratepayers whose money has thus aided in creating the immense estate may expect liberal treatment in return. ---<br/><br/>Yours obediently,<br/><br/>Signed by The Vicar of St James', Muswell Hill, the Minister of Park Chapel, Crouch End, a barrister living in Onslow Gardens and three members of the District Council.<br/><br/>It was a shot right across the bows of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. Their own religious leaders and the District Council, all up in arms saying in effect that the church was too rich and should be charitable, not greedy. The inclusion of the two clergymen was a shrewd move. Remember to that this was still in the height of the Darwin controversy. Darwin had split belief in the teachings of the Church and many people would have resented the power of the Church from that point of view alone. The Church was not so secure as it pretended to be.<br/><br/>The Evening News, 7 June 1895 said:-<br/><br/>"If the Ecclesiastical Comnussioners are not tackled at once, the building octopus will get a grip of the wood which will be very difficult to loosen later on, ---. Therefore it behoves Londoners to be up and doing if they would save one of their most delightful bits of rustic scenery. The public inquiry stands adjourned to Thursday next, and before then something must be done to convince the Commissioners that the citizens of London will not tolerate the confiscation of one of their favourite playgrounds."<br/><br/>A letter in the Daily Chronicle the next day said:-<br/><br/>.... It was with great relief that that the residents, some ten years ago, heard that the purchase of the Upper Wood had been effected; and how delightful a boon this has proved, anyone who visited them can testify, but all who exerted themselves to save these upper woods, which lie on the west side of Muswell Hill road, felt that their victory was incomplete so long as the sixty acres on the east side remained in danger. It is, as it were, an accident that the woods are divided by a broad high road. Can anyone doubt what the effect would be if the Churchyard Bottom Wood were replaced by rows of small villas, each sending out its contribution of smoke and soot? Can anyone doubt, too, the serious difference it would make to the picturesque setting of the purchased woods if a line of staring new houses were to be run up right over against their leafy frontage?'<br/><br/>This expressed the opinions of many people. In fact, the Gravel Pit Wood, which the writer calls the 'Upper Wood', had not been purchased, but given to the district by the Ecclesiastical Commission, a point they were to reiterate time and again over the years, but most people ignored it. The Commission was not going to give away a second wood whatever anyone said, and held this position to the end.<br/><br/>H.S.Chamberlain, of 5 Cranley Gardens,<br/>in a letter to the Times dated June 8, 1895, urged purchase.<br/><br/>I know that it is common to speak harshly of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, but as the trustees of a fund they are bound to administer it to the greatest advantage, and therefore, if anything is to be done to save the demolition of the wood, it appears to me that it can only be effected by the purchase of the property from the Comnussioners, who I know, are fully alive to the protection of free and open spaces for the people, and who, I feel sure, would be disposed to treat the matter of a purchase in a free and liberal spirit, as they have already done in the matter of the Shepherd's Cot-field, by granting a lease to the Crouch End Playing-fields Company - a small company in which I own a few shares, a small company which was formed exclusively for the purpose of securing the fields for cricket, tennis etc.<br/><br/>(This refers the the Crouch End Playing Fields which had been secured a few years later.)<br/><br/>As Chairman of the Muswell Hill Conservative Association, I am constantly in touch with the inhabitants, and I can safely affirm that every person resident in the neighbourhood would do anything in reason to preserve.<br/><br/>(All he wanted personally was Charity income to support his poor people. He demanded his acre of land - not a great deal surely - he believed the Commissioners' assurance that the wood was not in danger.)<br/><br/>' Muswell Hill Road was one of the best in Hornsey and would remain equally beautiful, houses or no houses',<br/><br/>(and then came the great rhetorical flourish.)<br/><br/>'Are the poor to suffer because of the sentimental objections and the hysterical cry of 'wolf just raised by your correspondents? Something must be done and that soon. An acre of back-land added to the charity-estate would make no apprec­iable difference to the land remaining, while the profit derived from it would succour many poor old and deserving persons in their declining years and enable us to hand over to our successors an estate which in the distant future would be of great value in the rendering of charitable aid to the deserving poor of the parish of Hornsey.'<br/><br/>Reading his letter one senses hysteria very near the surface. Why did he think the Commissioners wanted to build a road? Why should they spend all that money if not to build houses? He never seemed to realise that for an acre of land the the whole wood would be lost. But he had been with the problem for a long time. He was the person to whom the Commissioners had made the offer of sale for £25,000 years before and it is his name which is honoured in a plaque on Crouch End Clock Tower for saving the wood, but his trust in the Ecclesiastical Commissioners seems naive. It is sad that at the Inquiry he was to be cast as the devil.<br/><br/>The Inquiry Continued<br/><br/>The adjourned opened in Highgate on 15 June 1895. Expecting a large gather­ing, the Council Chamber had been changed completely. The usual tables had been removed and the room filled with chairs. By half past seven the room was crowded, with people jostling for seats.<br/><br/>Mr Murray, the Commissioner, said the Inquiry was really a simple one. Hornsey Parochial Charities wished to purchase a piece of land adjoining their charity property at the back. The question was whether the Charity Commission, which controlled all charities, had enough power to stop them. The Church Commissioners were prepared to sell the land at very favourable terms and the income of the Charity would be very considerable increased.<br/><br/>Against this there were three classes of objection.<br/><br/>The original Trust was for the purpose of providing cottages for the Poor, but the trustees were proposing to build villas which would be too expensive for the Poor. However, it was within the power of the Trustees to vary the terms of the Trust, so they could build villas if they thought that the Poor would benefit in the end. The poor people themselves might object, but liberal provisions had already been promised for them. The third objection related to the aesthetic and public side of the question. He took it from what he had read that the Charity Commission ought to interfere to prevent the Ecclesiastical Commissioners from exercising their own discretion in dealing with their own property.<br/><br/>The Inquiry discussed fine points, but the speakers kept coming back to the major problem of preventing any destruction of the wood. The Vestry Clerk of Islington, representing 300,000 people, made a formal protest about any part of the wood, so valuable for the people of Islington and Hornsey being used for private purposes. Mr Wilfred White said that if the Commissioners would give them time they would be able to raise the money to compensate the Trustees.<br/><br/>Mr Beaumont said they did not want villas, they wanted cottages for poor people who were being driven out of the district. Others said that there was no money to build cottages to replace the present delapidated ones but villas would be an economic proposition. Others retorted that there were score of villas to let in Highgate. The Wood was sacred. Stick to the question of the Wood.<br/><br/>Dr Fletcher said the cry among the working people was that there was nowhere to go. Working people came to him with the cry, "We are driven out of Highgate and are obliged to go to Highgate New Town." If the Muswell Hill Road frontage was sold there was no question but that roads might be cut right through the woods in the direction of Hornsey, but if the Commissioners could not get the land from the Charity Commission they could not cut the road.<br/><br/>He was very sure the cottages could be put into a fit state of repair. He was asked by the poor people, by the police and by a number of the working classes to represent these two points, that cottage accommodation was very sorely needed in Highgate and that if they once allowed the land to be sold, there was no telling where the hand of the builder would be stayed.<br/><br/>(Loud and prolonged cheers).<br/><br/>Numerous other people spoke and the Comnussioner summed up by saying that he took it that the prevailing opinion was in favour of retaining the cottages but the meeting should draw no conclusions from what he had said (Groans).<br/><br/>Others said that the Trustees of the Charity had failed in their duties by letting the the cottages fall into disrepair.<br/><br/>Mr H.R.Williams, the Trustee who had written to the paper earlier, said that he had it on the best authority that the Church Commissioners would make no roads whatever and they would not be benefitted one iota by the actions of the Charity Commissioners. Others were far less trusting and the meeting closed after nearly three hours.<br/><br/>'We are faced with the fact that in Highgate and Muswell Hill there are a number of persons who want the Churchyard Bottom Wood and will not be happy until they have got it - while nobody appears willing to spend a farthing to pay for it. Everyone says it would be a fine thing to have the wood as open space, but everybody thinks it is the duty of someone else to make it one. The Islington Vestry has 'resolved' on the subject, but the Islington Vestry does not offer a penny piece towards the purchase. --- There is no more difficult problem for the community or the individual to solve than how to gain possession of other people's property without paying for it.'<br/><br/>Paying for it was indeed the problem as Churchyard Bottom Wood became the subject of intense local and national debate. A joint committee was formed to raise money to save the wood. On 20 November 1896, C.F.Cory-Wright, Hon Treasurer, wrote to The Standard, a daily paper at that time, appealing for help. He reminded everyone of the danger of losing the wood and said it could only be saved by buying it. The Church Commissioners would sell for £25,000 and an extra (5,000 would be required for fencing and drainage, making a total of £30,000. This was too much for Hornsey Council to raise but they had already voted £10,000 towards the total. The woods were of inestimable value to all of North London so he appealed to public bodies and private people to raise the remaining £20,000. He warned that the present offer from the Church Commissioners was open only to the end of 1898. After that the builders would move in.<br/><br/>The appeal was warmly welcomed by the press. A Private Bill was rushed through Parliament and the Highgate Woods Preservation Act, 1897, became law. The Conunittee now had the right to advertise for contributions towards buying the Wood and preserving it.<br/><br/>In a fairly short time almost all the money was raised, but the last few thousand proved very difficult to raise and the Commissioners' deadline was a matter of weeks away. Mr Cory-Wright wrote pleading for more time but was granted a mere three months and then only if interest at 4 per cent was paid for the extra period on the full sum. In the end the London County Council, which had originally offered £2,500, made this up to £5,000 and the total was reached, but it was a close-run thing.<br/><br/>The Council decided to re-name the Wood as 'Queen's Woods' in honour of Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee and Hornsey put on a fine display of bunting when the Duchess of Albany formally declared the Wood open 'for the free use of the public for ever'.<br/><br/>While the campaign to save Churchyard Bottom Wood was run and directed by local people who felt passionately about this particular piece of woodland, they called on the help and experience of a vast network of people, some of whom had worked together on similar campaigns for over thirty years. The Committee issued an appeal, printed on very good quality paper and bearing some famous names.<br/><br/>The questions of open space and public health were major subjects of the Victorian vision.<br/><br/>The Open Spaces Movement<br/><br/>Octavia Hill, the great housing reformer, who had begun with three old houses in Marylebone, bought for her by Jolm Ruskin, had quickly become an expert on housing poor people in the healthiest conditions possible. Her way was to buy leases and then knock down some of the crowded houses in order to bring light and air to the rest, believing that fresh air and sunlight were the the only way poor people could be saved from 'putrid fever. She had learnt this as a child from her grandfather, Southwood Smith, who developed his theories at the Fever Hospital at King's Cross.<br/><br/>He had built the first Industrial Dwellings for poor people and had proved statistically that good air and decent drainage saved lives. Gibson Gardens, in Northwold Road, is a direct outcome of Southwood Smith's ideas. More Information on Gibson Gardens<br/><br/>The Importance of Open Air<br/><br/>Open spaces and the opportunity to breathe clean air, were essential for people living in one or two crowded rooms. Octavia Hill took her charges from the Lisson Grove slums, up Fitzjohn's Avenue to Hampstead Heath. She so loved the Fitzjohn's Avenue fields that she tried to buy them as a public park. They were to cost £10,000 and within three August weeks £8,500 had been raised. It needed only the end of the summer holidays and the return from holiday of sympathetic friends and the further £1,500 would have been raised, but the owners suddenly withdrew their offer. Despite all pleading, the fields were covered with large houses.<br/><br/>From this developed the campaign to save Parliament Hill, the next open space northwards from Lisson Grove, buying up fields in the path of the builders to make a permanent cordon sanitalre against the advancing bricks. The Parliament Hill Fields campaign was so successful that the Hampstead Heath Bill was passed and there was money over from the appeal. From this money and the impetus towards open spaces, was to develop the National Trust. Octavia Hill had been interested in protecting areas like Church Bottom Wood for years, so she was a natural ally in the fight to save the Wood.<br/><br/>The Commons Preservation Society also, was familiar with this kind of agitation and money collection. They had torn down fencing when lords of the manor had enclosed pieces of common land, leading both legal and illegal battles against the arrogant privatization of land traditionally free. Robert Hunter, their Honorary Solicitor from 1868, was always concerned with securing open spaces, large or small, for the public. He, now Sir Robert Hunter, became the Chairman of the Church Bottom Appeal. The Chairman of the Commons Preservation Society was Mr Shaw-Lefevre MP (later Lord Eversley) who played a big part in this and other campaigns in the House of Commons. Octavia Hill had been involved in their work from about 1875.<br/><br/>At the same time Octavia Hill was campaigning for a Burials Bill.<br/><br/>City churchyards had become so full and such a serious a hazard to health, by contaminating wells from which people drew their drinking water, that City burials were no longer permitted. Instead, cemetries were created on the outskirts of town. Abney Park Cemetary was one of these. There was then a movement to remove the headstones to the edges of the old town cemetries, re-inter the bodies elsewhere and turn the cemetries into gardens and open spaces, instead of building on them. This land in the centre of London was very valuable and speculators were avid to obtain it: Even the Quakers had built over one of their cemetries and threatened to do so again by building over Bunhill Fields. Octavia Hill had a network of allies in a dozen fields, so her help to save the Church Bottom Wood must have been invaluable.<br/><br/>The Metropolitan Gardens Society, set up in 1882, had laid out about two hundred small gardens in city centres by 1890. They later handed them over to the Local Authorities, so their support for the Churchyard Bottom Wood Appeal was assured from the start.<br/><br/>The Kyrle Society is forgotten now, but in its day had great influence on Town Planning and Open Space legislation. The Society had been set up about 1875 for 'the Diffusion of Beauty', to bring colour and interest into the lives of people living in dull, drab surroundings. Bright colour to walls and decoration, good singing, open spaces, Nature, Literature and Art. All these fell within the Society's remit. There was a Decorative Branch, for whom William Morris lectured; a Musical Branch to promote choirs and Happy Evenings for people in local school buildings; and a Literature Branch. The Society appealed regularly by letters in The Times, to 'the richer classes' for books and periodicals to be distributed to boys' and girls' clubs, almshouses and elsewhere. However the Open Spaces Committee was the most active. The very name 'Kyrle' came from Pope's The Man of Ross, the philanthropist who gave his birthplace to the people as a public park. | Churchyard Bottom Wood<br/><br/>Highgate<br/><br/>Igrexa de Bottom Wood, Highgate<br/><br/>O bosque da raíña<br/><br/>Entre 1860 e 1880 o centro foi arrancado da cidade de Londres para construír esgotos, ferrocarrís e novas estradas. As casas foron demolidas sen ter en conta os inquilinos que tiñan que atopar calquera aloxamento noutro lugar. Os xerentes foron a vivir en Kensington e St. John's Wood, mentres que os máis pobres se aglomeraron nas torres como Seven Dials e Lisson Grove. Para aqueles entre, os empregados e traballadores cualificados, construtores especulativos puxeron fila tras fila de vilas con terrazas e o Sr Pooter mudouse a Holloway. A xente de Muswell Hill observou casas arrastrándose a través dos campos de Finsbury Park, subindo Crouch Hill e baixando polo outro lado, de xeito que en 1880, Crouch End estaba a ser desenvolvido e non parecía haber xeito de deter o fluxo. Dez anos máis tarde vendíanse as grandes fincas de Muswell Hill. Vendéronse Upton Farm e os Comisionados Eclesiásticos querían desenvolver Churchyard Bottom Wood, agora chamado Queen's Wood. A historia tería feito unha obra de Ibsen. Dous grupos de persoas honestas e moi motivadas que loitan polo que cada un pensaba que era correcto. Os Comisionados Eclesiásticos, por unha banda, e o Comité de Caridades de Hornsey, por outra, ambos crían que facían o mellor para outras persoas, e o público levantouse en contra deles, ambos indignados.<br/><br/>Nese momento Muswell Hill Road era unha estrada rural, con Southwood Hall nun extremo e Upton Farm no outro. En 1894, Onslow Gardens foi construído, Connaught Gardens marcado, e os construtores estaban preparados para desenvolver a propiedade Woodlands. Cortado de Churchyard Bottom Wood era un grupo de cabanas derrubadas, nun sitio triangular. Un mapa sen data, mantido polos Comisionados Eclesiásticos, mostra seis Wasteland Cottages cunha abertura entre eles - non unha estrada, non metalizada, senón un camiño ata as camas de fresa detrás. Máis adiante estaba outra brecha que conducía a camiños a través do bosque. Estas dúas aberturas debían ser a base do plan. As mesmas dúas brechas e o chan limpo, que era o campo de fresa, pódense ver no mapa de 1894 abaixo. Amósanse como 'Muswell Hill Cottages' e, de paso, Peter Sellers viviría no mesmo sitio moito máis tarde. Para desenvolver a madeira como unha propiedade de vivenda, os comisarios precisaron conducir dúas estradas a través de Muswell Hill Road e construír casas ao longo deles. A fachada de Muswell Hill Road por si soa non proporcionaría espazo para casas suficientes para facer que a aventura valga a pena.<br/><br/>As terras e as cabanas foron dadas moito antes como casas de esmola para albergar anciáns e foron mantidas no seu nome polos Fideicomisarios dos Comisionados de Caridade de Hornsey. De espírito público, desexando facer o mellor para os seus antigos inquilinos, os Fideicomisarios non podían melloralos xa que non tiñan diñeiro. Algúns anos antes de que os Comisionados Eclesiásticos planeasen desenvolver Gravel Pit Wood (agora Highgate Wood) como unha propiedade de vivenda, pero isto atopou tal oposición que se retiraron. Ao mesmo tempo, ofreceron vender Churchyard Bottom Wood ao Consello de Distrito Urbano de Hornsey por £ 25.000, pero isto era demasiado para que Hornsey o levantase por si mesmo. O Consello dixo que as persoas que vivían fóra de Hornsey tamén gozaban da madeira e outras autoridades deberían axudar, pero non se deu ningunha axuda.<br/><br/>Mapa que mostra as cabanas de Muswell Hill que foron o centro da controversia.<br/><br/>Estrada de Muswell Hill sobre 1880<br/><br/>Parece probable que estes tres pares de cabanas fosen os que estaban no centro da disputa.<br/><br/>Os Comisionados Eclesiásticos querían recadar diñeiro para o seu traballo igrexal en Gran Bretaña e no estranxeiro. Consideraban que se lles dera a terra para ser usada para a propaganda da relixión e se isto significaba vender terras ou bosques, era un mal menor que restrinxir o traballo da igrexa. Eles deron Gravel Pit Wood ao público: no seu lugar desenvolverían Churchyard Bottom Wood.<br/><br/>Os Fideicomisarios das Caridades Hornsey querían producir un ingreso para axudar aos seus pobres, polo que fixeron unha oferta aos Comisionados. A súa peza de terra triangular tiña unha forma demasiado incómoda para ser desenvolvida economicamente, pero se os comisarios lles outorgaban máis terra para convertela nun sitio cadrado, construían vinte e cinco vilas ordenadas. Estes traería rendas de terra de £ 225 por ano, que poderían ser utilizados para aliviar a pobreza da xente Hornsey. A cambio permitirían a Comisión ers cortar dúas estradas a través das súas terras para que os Comisarios poderían desenvolver os bosques.<br/><br/>Cando esta oferta se fixo coñecida, a xente inmediatamente reaccionou con alarma.<br/><br/>O 16 de decembro de 1893, o deputado Carvell Williams preguntou na Cámara dos Comúns, se os Comisarios Eclesiásticos consentiran en vender unha franxa de terra aos Fideicomisarios de Hornsey Charities a condición de que unha estrada existente se ampliase a 40 pés, se isto era un preliminar a un esquema de construción e se a Cámara do Parlamento tería a oportunidade de expresar unha opinión.<br/><br/>O señor Leveson Gower, un comisario da Igrexa, respondeu "Si" á primeira parte.<br/><br/>Sr. Carvell Williams: Entendo que é a intención de destruír esa porción de Highgate Woods construíndo sobre ela?<br/><br/>Dous días despois, The Star publicou un artigo digno de calquera tabloide moderno.<br/><br/>A Estrela<br/>18 de decembro de 1893<br/><br/>O Parlamento debe vixiar atentamente a eses vellos vándalos e confederados do construtor de sardiñas, os comisionados eclesiásticos, que sempre están alienando algunha parte da terra ou favorecendo aos construtores en lugar do público en xeral. Os comisionados non ían vender a madeira de Churchyard Bottom aos contribuíntes, pero agora propoñen "abrila" cortando dúas estradas amplas a través dela en conexión cun dos seus numerosos esquemas de construción. Non vai alguén facer unha pregunta no Parlamento e comprobar a política de ladrillo e morteiro dos comisarios?<br/><br/>Cando se imprimiu, a pregunta xa fora formulada e a resposta era falsa ou falsa. Outros xornais retomaron a historia. The Times, nun longo informe, dixo que os Comnussioners non estaban preparados para dar un compromiso de que o Parlamento, ou calquera outro organismo público, debería ter a oportunidade de considerar calquera esquema para a construción no sitio da madeira.<br/><br/>A situación ferveu durante dezaoito meses ata que os comisarios eclesiásticos foron obrigados a abrir unha investigación, que comezou en Highgate o 31 de maio de 1895, presidida por un comisario eclesiástico asistente. A investigación produciu unha avalancha de cartas de xornais das que esta era a máis importante.<br/><br/>The Daily Chronicle, 5 de xuño de 1895.<br/><br/>VANDALISMO EN HIGHGATE<br/><br/>Señor -<br/><br/>Un dos bosques máis fermosos do subúrbio de Londres está ameazado. Axúdanos a afastar o que sería unha calamidade, non só para o distrito inmediato, senón para todo o norte densamente poboado de Londres? En ningunha parte da metrópole o construtor estivo máis activo que en Crouch End e Hornsey. Os fermosos prados de hai un ano ou dous agora son casas e tendas. As pilas de lastro tomaron o lugar dos olmos e castañas señoriais, e unha vez que as vilas agradables están a compartir o destino de Stroud Green, Harringay, Finsbury Park, Highbury e Islington.<br/><br/>---- O obxecto é a construción de dous camiños de corenta pés a través dos bosques. Neste distrito coñecemos o significado de camiños de corenta pés a través dos bosques. Significa que os bosques están condenados. Hai dez anos, a axitación salvou o bosque irmán de sesenta e cinco acres - o Gravel Pit Woods - e ninguén que viu as multitudes de vacacións do banco que afluían á estrada Archway das tristes rúas de Holloway, Islington e Clerkenwell, e observou o agudo gozo dos nenos e as festas familiares que sempre foi o Comisario de picnicing na herba e entre as ár ----<br/><br/>Os Comisarios Eclesiásticos posúen case un terzo da gran parroquia de Hornsey. Mediante o gasto liberal do diñeiro dos contribuíntes na apertura de estradas e o desenvolvemento xeral do distrito, o valor da súa propiedade aumentou enormemente, e deste incremento non gañado sacan cada ano grandes ingresos. Seguramente os contribuíntes cuxos cartos axudaron a crear o inmenso patrimonio poden esperar un tratamento liberal a cambio.<br/><br/>a túa obediencia,<br/><br/>Asinado polo Vicario de St James, Muswell Hill, o Ministro de Park Chapel, Crouch End, un avogado que vive en Onslow Gardens e tres membros do Consello de Distrito.<br/><br/>Os seus propios líderes relixiosos e o Consello de Distrito, todos en armas dicindo en efecto que a igrexa era demasiado rica e debería ser caritativa, non codiciosa. A inclusión dos dous clérigos foi un movemento astuto. Lembre que isto aínda estaba no auge da controversia de Darwin. Darwin dividira a crenza nas ensinanzas da Igrexa e moitas persoas resentirían o poder da Igrexa só desde ese punto de vista.<br/><br/>The Evening News, 7 de xuño de 1895 dixo:<br/><br/>"Se os eclesiásticos non son abordados dunha soa vez, o polbo do edificio terá un agarre da madeira que será moi difícil de afrouxar máis tarde, ---. Polo tanto, os londinenses deben estar de pé e facer se salvan un dos seus pedaciños máis deliciosos de paisaxe rústica. A investigación pública está adiada para o próximo xoves, e antes de entón debe facerse algo para convencer aos comisarios de que os cidadáns de Londres non tolerarán a confiscación dun dos seus terreos de xogo favoritos.<br/><br/>Unha carta no Diario Crónica do día seguinte dixo:<br/><br/>.... Foi con gran alivio que os residentes, hai uns dez anos, oíron que a compra do Bosque Superior fora efectuada; e como isto demostrou unha deliciosa bendición, calquera que os visitase pode testificar, pero todos os que se esforzaron por salvar estes bosques superiores, que están no lado oeste da estrada Muswell Hill, sentiron que a súa vitoria estaba incompleta mentres os sesenta acres no lado leste permaneceron en perigo. É, por así dicir, un accidente que os bosques estean divididos por unha ampla estrada alta. Pode alguén dubidar do efecto que sería se o cemiterio fose substituído por filas de pequenas vilas, cada unha enviando a súa contribución de fume e fuligem? Pode alguén dubidar, tamén, da seria diferenza que faría ao pintoresco escenario dos bosques comprados se unha liña de casas novas mirando para arriba tivese que ser correndo xusto sobre a súa frondosa fachada?<br/><br/>Isto expresou as opinións de moita xente. De feito, o Gravel Pit Wood, que o escritor chama o 'Upper Wood', non fora comprado, senón dado ao distrito pola Comisión Eclesiástica, un punto que ían reiterar unha e outra vez ao longo dos anos, pero a maioría da xente ignorou. A Comisión non ía dar unha segunda madeira o que alguén dixo, e mantivo esta posición ata o final.<br/><br/>H.S.Chamberlain, de 5 Cranley Gardens, nunha carta ao Times datada o 8 de xuño de 1895, instou á compra.<br/><br/>Sei que é común falar duramente dos comisionados eclesiásticos, pero como os administradores dun fondo están obrigados a administralo para a maior vantaxe, e por iso, se algo hai que facer para salvar a demolición da madeira, pareceme que só pode ser efectuado pola compra da propiedade dos Comnusioners, que eu sei que están completamente vivos para a protección da xente libre e aberta.<br/><br/>(Isto refírese aos Campos de Xogo Crouch End que foran asegurados uns anos máis tarde.)<br/><br/>Como presidente da Asociación Conservadora Muswell Hill, estou en contacto constante cos habitantes, e podo afirmar con seguridade que cada persoa residente no barrio faría calquera cousa por razón de preservar.<br/><br/>(Todo o que quería persoalmente era ingresos de caridade para apoiar a súa xente pobre. El esixiu o seu acre de terra - non moito seguramente - el cría que a seguridade dos comisarios de que a madeira non estaba en perigo.)<br/><br/>"Muswell Hill Road era un dos mellores en Hornsey e permanecería igualmente fermosa, casas ou non casas".<br/><br/>(E logo chegou o gran florecemento retórico.)<br/><br/>É que os pobres deben sufrir por mor das obxeccións sentimentais e o grito histérico de 'lobo acaba de ser levantado polos seus correspondentes? Algo debe ser feito e que pronto. Unha hectárea de terra engadida á propiedade de caridade non faría ningunha diferenza aparente para as terras restantes, mentres que o beneficio derivado del socorrería a moitas persoas pobres vellas e merecedoras nos seus anos de declive e permitiríanos entregar aos nosos sucesores unha propiedade que no futuro distante sería de gran valor na prestación de axuda caritativa aos pobres merecedores da parroquia de Hornsey.<br/><br/>Lendo a súa carta un sente histeria moi preto da superficie. Por que pensou que os comisarios querían construír unha estrada? Por que deberían gastar todo ese diñeiro se non para construír casas? Nunca se deu conta de que por un acre de terra todo o bosque se perdería. Pero el estivera co problema durante moito tempo. Foi a persoa á que os Comisionados fixeran a oferta de venda por £25.000 anos antes e é o seu nome o que é honrado nunha placa na Torre do Reloxo de Crouch por salvar a madeira, pero a súa confianza nos Comisionados Eclesiásticos parece inxenua. É triste que na investigación fose lanzado como o demo.<br/><br/>A investigación continuou<br/><br/>O adiamento abriuse en Highgate o 15 de xuño de 1895. Agardando unha gran xuntanza, a Sala do Consello cambiou completamente. As mesas habituais foran retiradas e a sala encheuse de cadeiras. Ás sete e media a sala estaba chea, con xente empurrando polos asentos.<br/><br/>O señor Murray, o comisario, dixo que a investigación era realmente sinxela. Hornsey Parochial Charities desexaba comprar un anaco de terra contigua á súa propiedade de caridade na parte traseira. A pregunta era se a Comisión de Caridade, que controlaba todas as organizacións benéficas, tiña o poder suficiente para detelos. Os Comisionados da Igrexa estaban preparados para vender a terra en condicións moi favorables e os ingresos da Caridade aumentarían considerablemente.<br/><br/>En contra disto había tres clases de obxección.<br/><br/>O fideicomiso orixinal tiña o propósito de proporcionar cabanas para os pobres, pero os administradores propuxeron construír vilas que serían demasiado caras para os pobres. Con todo, estaba no poder dos Fideicomisarios variar os termos do Fideicomiso, para que puidesen construír vilas se pensaban que os pobres se beneficiarían ao final. Os propios pobres poderían opoñerse, pero xa se lles prometeran disposicións liberais. A terceira obxección estaba relacionada co lado estético e público da cuestión. Tomou do que lera que a Comisión de Caridade debería interferir para evitar que os Comisionados Eclesiásticos exercesen a súa propia discreción ao tratar coas súas propias propiedades.<br/><br/>A investigación discutiu puntos finos, pero os oradores seguían volvendo ao principal problema de evitar calquera destrución da madeira. O secretario de Vestry de Islington, que representaba a 300.000 persoas, fixo unha protesta formal sobre calquera parte da madeira, tan valiosa para a xente de Islington e Hornsey que se usaba para fins privados. Wilfred White dixo que se os comisarios lles daban tempo, poderían recadar os cartos para compensar aos fideicomisarios.<br/><br/>O señor Beaumont dixo que non querían vilas, querían casas para os pobres que estaban sendo expulsados do distrito. Outros dicían que non había diñeiro para construír cabanas para substituír as actuais en ruínas, pero as vilas serían unha proposición económica. Outros respondían que había decenas de vilas para deixar en Highgate. O Bosque era sagrado. Reflexiona sobre a cuestión da madeira.<br/><br/>O Dr. Fletcher dixo que o berro entre a xente traballadora era que non había a onde ir. A xente traballadora veu a el co berro, "Somos expulsados de Highgate e estamos obrigados a ir a Highgate New Town." Se a fachada da estrada de Muswell Hill foi vendida, non había dúbida de que as estradas poderían ser cortadas directamente a través dos bosques en dirección a Hornsey, pero se os comisarios non podían obter a terra da Comisión de Caridade non poderían cortar a estrada.<br/><br/>Estaba moi seguro de que as cabanas poderían ser colocadas nun estado adecuado de reparación. Pedíronlle a xente pobre, a policía e varias clases traballadoras que representasen estes dous puntos, que aloxamento na cabana fose moi necesario en Highgate e que se unha vez permitían que a terra fose vendida, non se dicía onde quedaría a man do construtor.<br/><br/>(Aplausos e aplausos prolongados).<br/><br/>Numerosas outras persoas falaron e o Comnussioner resumiu dicindo que el considerou que a opinión prevalecente era a favor de reter as cabanas, pero a reunión non debería sacar conclusións do que dixera (Gritos).<br/><br/>Outros dixeron que os Fideicomisarios da Caridade fallaran nos seus deberes ao deixar que as cabanas caesen en desuso.<br/><br/>O Sr. H.R. Williams, o fideicomisario que escribira ao xornal anteriormente, dixo que tiña a mellor autoridade de que os Comisionados da Igrexa non farían estradas en absoluto e non se beneficiarían nin un iota polas accións dos Comisionados da Caridade. Outros eran moito menos confiados e a reunión pechou despois de case tres horas.<br/><br/>Enfrontámonos ao feito de que en Highgate e Muswell Hill hai unha serie de persoas que queren o cemiterio de Bottom Wood e non serán felices ata que o teñan, mentres que ninguén parece disposto a gastar un dólar para pagalo. Todo o mundo di que sería bo ter a madeira como espazo aberto, pero todo o mundo pensa que é o deber de alguén facelo. O Islington Vestry ten 'resolto' sobre o tema, pero o Islington Vestry non ofrece unha peza de un centavo cara á compra. Non hai problema máis difícil de resolver para a comunidade ou para o individuo que como obter a posesión da propiedade doutras persoas sen pagar por ela.<br/><br/>Pagar por iso foi de feito o problema xa que Churchyard Bottom Wood converteuse en obxecto de intenso debate local e nacional. Formouse un comité conxunto para recadar diñeiro para salvar a madeira. O 20 de novembro de 1896, C.F. Cory-Wright, tesoureiro honorario, escribiu a The Standard, un xornal diario nese momento, pedindo axuda. Recordou a todos o perigo de perder a madeira e dixo que só se podía salvar comprando. Os Comisionados da Igrexa venderían por £ 25.000 e un extra (5.000 serían necesarios para a esgrima e drenaxe, facendo un total de £ 30.000. Isto era demasiado para o Consello de Hornsey para levantar, pero xa votaran £ 10,000 cara ao total. Os bosques eran de inestimable valor para todo o norte de Londres, polo que apelou aos organismos públicos e á xente privada para recaudar as 20.000 libras restantes. Despois diso, os construtores entraron.<br/><br/>O apelo foi acollido calorosamente pola prensa. Un proxecto de lei privado foi aprobado polo Parlamento e a Highgate Woods Preservation Act, de 1897, converteuse en lei. O Conunittee agora tiña o dereito de anunciar contribucións para comprar a madeira e preservala.<br/><br/>Nun tempo bastante curto recadouse case todo o diñeiro, pero os últimos miles resultaron moi difíciles de recadar e o prazo dos comisarios estaba a cuestión de semanas. O Sr. Cory-Wright escribiu pedindo máis tempo, pero foi concedido un mero tres meses e despois só se os xuros ao 4% foron pagados polo período adicional sobre a suma completa. Ao final, o Consello do Condado de Londres, que orixinalmente ofreceu £ 2.500, fixo isto ata £ 5.000 e o total foi alcanzado, pero foi unha cousa de curto prazo.<br/><br/>O Consello decidiu renomear o Bosque como "Os Bosques da Raíña" en honra do Xubileu de Diamante da Raíña Vitoria e Hornsey fixo unha boa exhibición cando a Duquesa de Albany declarou formalmente o Bosque aberto "para o libre uso do público para sempre".<br/><br/>Mentres que a campaña para salvar Churchyard Bottom Wood foi dirixida e dirixida por persoas locais que sentían paixón por este peza de bosque en particular, pediron a axuda e a experiencia dunha vasta rede de persoas, algunhas das cales traballaran xuntas en campañas similares durante máis de trinta anos. O Comité emitiu unha apelación, impresa en papel de moi boa calidade e con algúns nomes famosos.<br/><br/>As cuestións do espazo aberto e a saúde pública foron temas principais da visión vitoriana.<br/><br/>Movemento Espazos Abertos<br/><br/>Octavia Hill, a gran reformadora da vivenda, que comezara con tres casas vellas en Marylebone, compradas por ela por Jolm Ruskin, axiña se converteu nunha experta en aloxar a xente pobre nas condicións máis saudables posibles. O seu xeito era mercar arrendamentos e logo derrubar algunhas das casas cheas de xente para traer luz e aire ao resto, crendo que o aire fresco e a luz do sol eran a única forma de que a xente pobre puidese salvarse da febre pútrida. Ela aprendera isto cando era nena do seu avó, Southwood Smith, que desenvolveu as súas teorías no Fever Hospital en King's Cross.<br/><br/>Construíu as primeiras Vivendas Industriais para persoas pobres e demostrou estatisticamente que o bo aire e a drenaxe decente salvaron vidas. Gibson Gardens, en Northwold Road, é un resultado directo das ideas de Southwood Smith.<br/><br/>A importancia do aire libre<br/><br/>Os espazos abertos e a oportunidade de respirar aire limpo eran esenciais para as persoas que vivían nunha ou dúas habitacións cheas de xente. Octavia Hill levou os seus cargos desde os barrios pobres de Lisson Grove, ata Fitzjohn's Avenue ata Hampstead Heath. Amaba tanto os campos de Fitzjohn's Avenue que tratou de compralos como un parque público. Custarían 10.000 libras e en tres semanas de agosto recadáranse 8.500 libras. Só necesitaba o final das vacacións de verán e o regreso de vacacións de amigos simpáticos e os £ 1.500 adicionais serían levantados, pero os propietarios de súpeto retiraron a súa oferta. A pesar de todas as súplicas, os campos estaban cubertos con grandes casas.<br/><br/>A partir disto desenvolveuse a campaña para salvar o Parliament Hill, o seguinte espazo aberto cara ao norte de Lisson Grove, comprando campos no camiño dos construtores para facer un cordón sanitario permanente contra os ladrillos que avanzaban. A campaña de Parliament Hill Fields tivo tanto éxito que se aprobou o Hampstead Heath Bill e houbo diñeiro extra do recurso. Octavia Hill estivera interesada en protexer áreas como Church Bottom Wood durante anos, polo que foi unha aliada natural na loita para salvar a Wood.<br/><br/>A Sociedade de Preservación dos Comúns tamén estaba familiarizada con este tipo de axitación e recadación de diñeiro. Tiveron que derrubar as cercas cando os señores da mansión encerraron pezas de terra común, levando a cabo batallas legais e ilegais contra a arrogante privatización de terras tradicionalmente libres. Robert Hunter, o seu Procurador Honorario desde 1868, sempre se preocupou de asegurar espazos abertos, grandes ou pequenos, para o público. El, agora Sir Robert Hunter, converteuse no Presidente do Church Bottom Appeal. O presidente da Commons Preservation Society foi o deputado Shaw-Lefevre (máis tarde Lord Eversley), que xogou un papel importante nesta e noutras campañas na Cámara dos Comúns.<br/><br/>Ao mesmo tempo, Octavia Hill estaba a facer campaña por unha lei de enterramentos.<br/><br/>As igrexas municipais estaban tan cheas e constituían un grave perigo para a saúde, ao contaminar os pozos dos que a xente sacaba a súa auga potable, que xa non se permitían os enterramentos municipais. O cemiterio de Abney Park foi un deles. Houbo entón un movemento para quitar as lápidas aos bordos dos cemiterios da cidade vella, volver a enterrar os corpos noutros lugares e converter os cemiterios en xardíns e espazos abertos, en vez de construír sobre eles. Esta terra no centro de Londres era moi valiosa e os especuladores estaban ansiosos por obtela: mesmo os cuáqueros construíran sobre un dos seus cemiterios e ameazaron con facelo de novo construíndo sobre Bunhill Fields. Octavia Hill tiña unha rede de aliados nunha ducia de campos, polo que a súa axuda para salvar o Bosque de Abaixo da Igrexa debeu ser inestimable.<br/><br/>A Metropolitan Gardens Society, creada en 1882, tiña uns douscentos pequenos xardíns nos centros da cidade en 1890. Máis tarde entregáronos ás autoridades locais, polo que o seu apoio ao Churchyard Bottom Wood Appeal estaba asegurado desde o principio.<br/><br/>A Sociedade Kyrle está esquecida agora, pero no seu día tivo unha gran influencia na lexislación de Urbanismo e Espazo Aberto. A Sociedade foi creada ao redor de 1875 para a 'Difusión da Beleza', para traer cor e interese na vida das persoas que viven en ambientes aburridos e sombríos. Cor brillante nas paredes e decoración, bo canto, espazos abertos, natureza, literatura e arte. Había unha rama decorativa, para a quen William Morris deu conferencias; unha rama musical para promover coros e boas noites para a xente nos edificios escolares locais; e unha rama de literatura. A Sociedade apelou regularmente por cartas en The Times, ás "clases máis ricas" para que os libros e periódicos fosen distribuídos a clubs de nenos e nenas, casas de esmolas e noutros lugares. O propio nome "Kyrle" provén de Pope's O home de Ross, o filántropo que deu o seu lugar de nacemento á xente como un parque público. |
| With Thanksgiving around the corner, here are some festive file folder games we made for the girls. Both Thanksgiving games focus on math skills. And I'm grateful once again to my husband, Ed, for making all the clipart for me.<br/><br/>Thanksgiving Pattern Making<br/><br/>Like the name says, this game is about making patterns. Little ones just learning about patterns, can simply match the pictures onto the pattern strips, while others can continue the pattern with the picture cards on the blank strips.<br/><br/>To make the file folder, you want to cut out the grid of pictures to make the card pieces. I recommend laminating them to help them last longer. Then glue the pattern strips down on the file folder.<br/><br/>I wanted to have the blank pattern strips too so that the girls could see where to continue the pattern and how many to lay out. I attached them to the side of the folder using tape so that they could fold in to pack up the game and extend to layout the pattern.<br/><br/>I also added an extra blank one so that the girls could make their own pattern as well.<br/><br/>Turkey Number Game<br/><br/>In this game the girls add the feathers to the turkey body while practicing counting and number recognition. I used the colorless feathers to act as a guide for where to add the feathers and so that the girls could match the numbers. And be sure when gluing down the turkey body you only glue in the center so that the wing pieces can slide under the body.<br/><br/>Once all the feathers are laid out, we practice some simple arithmetic, such as taking away three feathers and seeing how many are left then adding two back to see what it equals.<br/><br/>In addition to black and white wings, we also included a colorless turkey in case you want to have the little ones color their own set. Instead of a file folder game you can turn this into a craft, coloring the pieces, cutting them out, and gluing them together.<br/><br/>Another option is to use the pieces to make a felt board story. We sometimes sing a turkey version of 10 Little Indians:<br/><br/>Like this:<br/><br/>Who Am I?<br/><br/>I think this is where I'm suppose to say something witty about myself. Oh well. I'm a stay-at-home mom to three awesome kids--our twin daughters who are seven now and a two-year-old son who is full of energy. In my pre-children life I was a teacher and I now homeschool our children. I'm also married to Ed, who is currently serving in the Air Force, and is the love of my life (it'd be awkward if he wasn't). Our family is big on books, crafts, and having fun together. I just thought I would share our activities in my own little corner of the internet.<br/><br/>Zoe appears to have it all--rich, handsome husband, easy New York life--but she made mistakes in her past and those mistakes are coming back up in her new life. I found myself on the edge of my seat for most of the book and was surprised...<br/><br/>I loved this book, I love the story, and I am grateful Margot Shetterly brought it to light. My only complaint was that I wished she discussed Katherine Johnson's role in the later missions a bit more but I guess the story had to end som...<br/><br/>I wanted to like this book and I did throughout most of it. Dana finds out her estranged husband and his girlfriend are found dead in the New Mexico desert. I was immediately drawn in by her character and the story. I really enjoyed seei... | Con Acción de Grazas á volta da esquina, aquí están algúns xogos festivos de carpetas de ficheiros que fixemos para as nenas. Ambos os xogos de Acción de Grazas céntranse nas habilidades matemáticas. E estou agradecido unha vez máis ao meu marido, Ed, por facer todas as imaxes para min.<br/><br/>de Acción de Grazas<br/><br/>Como o seu nome indica, este xogo trata de facer patróns. Os pequenos só aprenden sobre patróns, poden simplemente combinar as imaxes nas tiras de patróns, mentres que outros poden continuar o patrón coas tarxetas de imaxe nas tiras en branco.<br/><br/>Para facer o cartafol de ficheiros, quere cortar a grella de imaxes para facer as pezas de tarxetas. Recomendo laminalas para axudalas a durar máis tempo. A continuación, pegue as tiras de patrón no cartafol de ficheiros.<br/><br/>Quería ter as tiras de patrón en branco tamén para que as nenas puidesen ver onde continuar o patrón e cantas para poñer. Fixeino ao lado do cartafol usando cinta adhesiva para que puidesen dobrarse para empacar o xogo e estender a disposición do patrón.<br/><br/>Tamén engadín un extra en branco para que as nenas puidesen facer o seu propio patrón tamén.<br/><br/>Xogo de números de Turquía<br/><br/>Neste xogo as nenas engaden as plumas ao corpo do pavo mentres practican a contaxe e o recoñecemento numérico. Usei as plumas incoloras para actuar como unha guía para onde engadir as plumas e para que as nenas puidesen coincidir cos números. E asegúrese de que ao pegar o corpo do pavo só pega no centro para que as pezas das ás poidan deslizarse baixo o corpo.<br/><br/>Unha vez que todas as plumas están dispostas, practicamos algunha aritmética simple, como quitar tres plumas e ver cantas quedan e engadir dúas para ver o que equivale.<br/><br/>Ademais das ás en branco e negro, tamén incluímos un pavo incoloro no caso de que queiras que os pequenos teñan a súa propia cor. No canto dun xogo de cartafol de ficheiros, pode converter isto nun oficio, coloreando as pezas, cortándoas e pegándoas xuntas.<br/><br/>Outra opción é usar as pezas para facer unha historia de fieltro. Ás veces cantamos unha versión de pavo de 10 Little Indians:<br/><br/>Como isto:<br/><br/>Quen son eu?<br/><br/>Creo que aquí é onde teño que dicir algo ingenioso sobre min mesmo. Ben. Son unha nai que vive na casa con tres nenos marabillosos, as nosas fillas xemelgas que agora teñen sete anos e un fillo de dous anos que está cheo de enerxía. Na miña vida de pre-nenos eu era un profesor e agora eu homeschool os nosos fillos. Eu tamén estou casado con Ed, que actualmente está servindo na Forza Aérea, e é o amor da miña vida (sería incómodo se non fose). A nosa familia é grande en libros, artesanía e diversión xuntos. Pensei que compartiría as nosas actividades no meu pequeno recuncho de Internet.<br/><br/>Zoe parece ter todo - rico, fermoso marido, fácil Nova York vida - pero ela cometeu erros no seu pasado e eses erros están a volver na súa nova vida. Atopeime no bordo do meu asento para a maior parte do libro e foi sorprendido ...<br/><br/>Encántame este libro, encántame a historia, e estou agradecido Margot Shetterly trouxo á luz. A miña única queixa foi que eu quería discutir o papel de Katherine Johnson nas misións posteriores un pouco máis, pero supoño que a historia tivo que acabar así ...<br/><br/>Quería gustar deste libro e o fixen durante a maior parte del. Dana descobre que o seu marido afastado e a súa moza son atopados mortos no deserto de Novo México. Inmediatamente fun atraído polo seu personaxe ea historia. Eu realmente gocei seei ... |
| Alcohol use by persons under age 21 has been identified as a major public health problem. Studies note that it increases the risks for disability, and may be detrimental to the developing brain. Minors who drink are more likely to commit suicide, break the law, or be victims of violence. Alcohol is implicated in nearly one-third of youth traffic fatalities. The total annual cost of underage drinking is estimated at $62 billion. While most laws intended to prevent underage drinking are passed at the state level, there has been legislative activity and interest at the federal level to support states' efforts to curb the problem. This report describes the extent of underage alcohol use, recent legislative activity on this issue, and various policy implications. It will be updated as new data become available. | O consumo de alcol por persoas menores de 21 anos identificouse como un importante problema de saúde pública. Os estudos sinalan que aumenta os riscos de discapacidade e pode ser prexudicial para o cerebro en desenvolvemento. Os menores que beben son máis propensos a suicidarse, violar a lei ou ser vítimas de violencia. O alcohol está implicado en case un terzo das mortes por tráfico xuvenil. O custo total anual de beber menores estímase en $ 62 millóns. Aínda que a maioría das leis destinadas a evitar o consumo de bebidas alcohólicas por menores de idade son aprobadas a nivel estatal, houbo actividade lexislativa e interese a nivel federal para apoiar os esforzos dos estados para frear o problema. Este informe describe o alcance do consumo de alcol por menores de idade, a actividade lexislativa recente sobre este tema e varias implicacións políticas. Será actualizado a medida que se dispoña de novos datos. |
| Tag Archives: real food<br/><br/>Last week I wrote about the Nordic Food Manifesto, and how Denmark created a strong "real food" culture largely from an intentional effort led by Claus Meyer. It wasn't political lobbying or public petitioning that resulted in food reform, but rather a grassroots effort led by citizens with the power to actually implement and follow-through with change.<br/><br/>I ended the post alluding to one question: Why is it so hard for us to do this ourselves, as individuals? If an entire country can implement and spread a common view towards food, why can't we?<br/><br/>There's nothing really stopping us from mimicking Denmark's success. The problem is, we're inundated with so many messages about what we should be eating, and how we should be living, it's hard to know where to start. So rather than following successful frameworks that have been shown to work (like the Nordic Food Manifesto), most people jump from diet craze to diet craze, trying to find the "right way to eat."<br/><br/>But how did Claus Meyer succeed? What was the secret sauce that helped the Manifesto take hold? And is it reasonable to think we can apply those lessons to our own lives? Continue reading →<br/><br/>Share this:<br/><br/>My knife plunged into the beef with an audible crunch, pop, and sizzle.<br/><br/>"Whooaaah!"<br/><br/>I looked up at my sister as we both laughed in surprise, and continued smiling as I finished cutting my first bite.

Non foi o lobby político ou as peticións públicas o que resultou na reforma alimentaria, senón un esforzo de base liderado por cidadáns co poder de realmente implementar e seguir co cambio.<br/><br/>Terminei o post aludindo a unha pregunta: por que é tan difícil para nós facer isto nós mesmos, como individuos? Se un país enteiro pode implementar e difundir unha visión común cara á comida, por que non podemos?<br/><br/>Non hai nada que nos impida imitar o éxito de Dinamarca. O problema é que estamos inundados con tantas mensaxes sobre o que deberíamos comer, e como deberíamos vivir, é difícil saber por onde comezar. Entón, en lugar de seguir marcos exitosos que se demostraron que funcionan (como o Manifesto Nórdico da Alimentación), a maioría das persoas saltan da mania da dieta á mania da dieta, tratando de atopar o "modo correcto de comer".<br/><br/>Pero como tivo éxito Claus Meyer? Cal foi a salsa secreta que axudou a que o Manifesto se apoderase? E é razoable pensar que podemos aplicar esas leccións ás nosas propias vidas?
