Undocumented migrants have nothing. They are not allowed to work. They have no right to state benefits nor to a place to live. They are unseen and potentially the most vulnerable group in the UK today.<br/><br/>Undocumented (or irregular) migrants include those trafficked into the sex trade or for domestic servitude; they include visa overstayers; those whose asylum applications have been refused and others who have been subject to failures in the immigration system. All of these may originally have come to the UK legally.<br/><br/>'Illegal immigrants' – those imagined to have entered the country in the backs of lorries – make up a small proportion of the undocumented.<br/><br/>Indeed some sources suggest that half the estimated 120,000 undocumented children in the UK were actually born here to undocumented parents. These children are disadvantaged from birth, solely by their immigration status.<br/><br/>The blog tells the stories of the undocumented. It highlights their daily struggles and vulnerabilities, but also their strength and resilience. It's not an easy read.<br/><br/>You can access the blog via our website (bottom of right hand column on Home Page).<br/><br/>The blog has won the online category of the Speaking Together media awards. The awards were a new addition this year to the Migrant and Refugee Woman of the Year Awards celebration at the Royal Festival Hall in London as part of International Women's Day. The panel of judges – including novelist and playwright Gillian Slovo, and journalist and author, Hannah Pool – was particularly looking for work that challenged myths and stereotypes.<br/><br/>The blog has also won the Blog North Awards 2013 in the Best Writing category and was also shortlisted for an Amnesty International Media Award. | Navegación de publicacións<br/><br/>"Life Without Papers" gaña o premio ao mellor guión<br/><br/>O proxecto do blog, "Life Without Papers", creado por Len Grant, conta historias de familias e mozos migrantes indocumentados. Os migrantes indocumentados non teñen nada. Non se lles permite traballar. Non teñen dereito a beneficios estatais nin a un lugar para vivir. Son invisibles e potencialmente o grupo máis vulnerable no Reino Unido hoxe.<br/><br/>Os inmigrantes indocumentados (ou irregulares) inclúen os traficados para o comercio sexual ou para a servidume doméstica; inclúen os que superan a estadía de visado; aqueles cuxas solicitudes de asilo foron rexeitadas e outros que foron suxeitos a fallos no sistema de inmigración. Todos estes poden chegar inicialmente ao Reino Unido legalmente.<br/><br/>Os "inmigrantes ilegais" -os que se imaxinan que entraron no país nas costas dos camións- constitúen unha pequena proporción dos indocumentados.<br/><br/>De feito, algunhas fontes suxiren que a metade dos estimados 120.000 nenos indocumentados no Reino Unido naceron aquí de pais indocumentados. Estes nenos están en desvantaxe desde o nacemento, unicamente polo seu estado migratorio.<br/><br/>O blog conta as historias dos indocumentados. Destaca as súas loitas e vulnerabilidades diarias, pero tamén a súa forza e resiliencia. Non é unha lectura fácil.<br/><br/>Podes acceder ao blog a través do noso sitio web (parte inferior da columna da dereita na páxina de inicio).<br/><br/>O blog gañou a categoría en liña dos premios dos medios de comunicación Falando xuntos. Os premios foron unha nova adición este ano á celebración dos Premios da Muller Migrante e Refuxiada do Ano no Royal Festival Hall en Londres como parte do Día Internacional da Muller. O panel de xuíces, incluíndo a novelista e dramaturga Gillian Slovo, e a xornalista e autora Hannah Pool, estaba particularmente á procura de traballos que desafiaran mitos e estereotipos.<br/><br/>O blog tamén gañou os Premios Blog North 2013 na categoría de Mellor Guión e tamén foi nomeado para un Premio de Medios de Amnistía Internacional. |
| Sabbath School Lesson<br/><br/>In Galatians, Paul tackles issues such as freedom, the role of the law in salvation, our condition in Christ, and the nature of the Spirit-led life, as well as the age-old question, How can sinful humans be made right before a holy and just God?<br/><br/>Many scholars believe that Galatians may be the earliest of Paul's letters. It was written in A.D. 49, shortly after the famous Jerusalem Council (Acts 15). Therefore, the book may be the oldest Christian document known. As Acts and Galatians make clear, the early church found itself in a fierce battle over the nature of salvation, especially in the case of Gentiles. According to a group of Jewish believers, known as Judaizers, belief in Jesus alone was not good enough for Gentiles. Gentiles must also be circumcised and follow the laws of Moses (Acts 15:1).<br/><br/>This quarter's Bible study guide invites us to journey with the apostle Paul as he pleads with the Galatians to remain true to Jesus. It also gives us a chance to reflect on our own understanding of the truths that opened the way for Martin Luther's ultimate break with Rome and the restoration of the biblical gospel. | Escola Sabatín<br/><br/>En Gálatas, Paulo aborda cuestións como a liberdade, o papel da lei na salvación, a nosa condición en Cristo e a natureza da vida dirixida polo Espírito, así como a antiga pregunta: Como poden os humanos pecadores ser feitos xustos diante dun Deus santo e xusto?<br/><br/>Moitos estudiosos cren que Gálatas pode ser a primeira das cartas de Paulo. Foi escrito en 49 dC, pouco despois do famoso Concilio de Xerusalén (Feitos 15). Polo tanto, o libro pode ser o documento cristián máis antigo coñecido. Como Actos e Gálatas deixan claro, a igrexa primitiva atopouse nunha feroz batalla sobre a natureza da salvación, especialmente no caso dos xentís. Segundo un grupo de crentes xudeus, coñecidos como xudaizantes, a crenza só en Xesús non era suficiente para os xentís. Os xentís tamén deben ser circuncidados e seguir as leis de Moisés (Feitos 15:1).<br/><br/>A guía de estudo bíblico deste trimestre convídanos a viaxar co apóstolo Paulo mentres implora aos gálatas que permanezan fieis a Xesús. Tamén nos dá a oportunidade de reflexionar sobre a nosa propia comprensión das verdades que abriron o camiño para a ruptura definitiva de Martiño Lutero con Roma e a restauración do evanxeo bíblico. |

Era a filla maior de Carlos II, Gran Duque de Mecklemburgo, Carlota e as súas irmás, a raíña Luísa de Prusia, a raíña Frederica de Hannover e a princesa Teresa de Thurn und Taxis, eran consideradas as mulleres máis fermosas do seu tempo. Jean Paul Friedrich Richter dedicou a súa novela Titán ás catro fermosas, Charlotte creceu en Hannover, onde o seu pai serviu como gobernador, en nome do seu cuñado, o rei Xurxo III do Reino Unido, que vivía en Londres. Cando Carlota tiña doce anos, a súa nai morreu e foi criada pola irmá da súa nai, Carlota, que casou co seu pai en 1784 e as súas irmás foron levadas pola súa avoa, María Luísa Albertina de Leiningen-Falkenburg-Dagsburg en Darmstadt. O 3 de setembro de 1785, á idade de quince anos, Carlota casou co duque Federico, duque de Saxonia-Altenburg, o matrimonio non foi feliz, Carlota era mentalmente superior a Federico, que comezou a ignorala. Tamén tiñan problemas, Saxonia-Hildburghausen fora arruinada financeiramente polas políticas desastrosas dos predecesores de Federico. Os receptores permitiron ao duque e á duquesa só unha reducida lista civil, o pai de Carlota e dous irmáns adoitaban quedarse con ela en Hildburghausen. En 1792, a avoa de Charlotte e as súas irmás fuxiron ante o avance do exército francés de Darmstadt a Hildburghausen e a súa avoa notou o marido de Charlotte. Charlotte, que nunca amou a este home, sempre está embarazada, a familia pasou varias semanas despreocupadas en Hildburghausen. En 1793, a avoa de Charlotte regresou do exilio e viaxou coas irmás de Charlotte a Fráncfort do Meno, Charlotte tivo unha relación moi íntima e amorosa coa súa irmá Friederike e familiares en Strelitz. En 1803 e 1805, a parella real prusiana visitou Hildburghausen, para esta ocasión, os receptores permitiron á parella ducal renovar algúns dos seus mobles. Luísa axudara a redactar a declaración de guerra, Christian Truchseß von Wetzhausen zu Bettenburg era amigo da parella ducal e padriño do fillo de Carlota, Eduardo. Moitos espectadores viñeran ver á princesa bávara, e cando Truchseß recibiu os seus convidados, intentou levar a Carlota ao seu castelo, pero ela rexeitou, refiréndose á súa filla. Truchseß respondeu: "Sua Alteza perdóname, pero mentres este castelo permaneceu aquí, Therese entón agarrou os baróns outro brazo, e os tres deles pasaron a través da porta xuntos. A duquesa deu preto da metade dos seus ingresos para os pobres, pensionistas<br/><br/>1617.<br/>Príncipe Carlos de Hesse-Kassel<br/>---<br/>O príncipe Carlos de Hesse-Kassel foi un membro cadete da casa de Hesse-Kassel e un mariscal de campo danés. Criado con parentes na corte danesa, pasou a maior parte da súa vida en Dinamarca e a súa nai era filla do rei Xurxo II de Gran Bretaña e Carolina de Ansbach e irmá da raíña Luísa de Dinamarca. O seu pai, o futuro landgrave, deixou a familia en 1747, en 1755 terminou formalmente o matrimonio con María. O avó, Guillerme VIII, Landgrave de Hesse, concedeu o condado de Hanau e os seus ingresos a María, o mozo príncipe Carlos e os seus dous irmáns, Guillerme e Federico, foron criados pola súa nai e promovidos por parentes protestantes desde 1747. En 1756, María trasladouse a Dinamarca, para coidar dos fillos menores de idade da súa irmá, a raíña Luísa de Dinamarca. Os príncipes de Hesse máis tarde permaneceron en Dinamarca, converténdose nos seus importantes señores, só o irmán maior Guillerme volveu a Hesse, en 1785, ao ascender ao landgraviato. En 1758 foi nomeado coronel, á idade de 20 anos, tamén en 1766, foi nomeado Gobernador Xeral de Noruega, cargo que mantivo ata 1768, pero que permaneceu na súa maioría titular, xa que nunca foi a Noruega durante este período. En 1763, o seu irmán maior Guillerme casou co seu curmán primeiro, Carlos seguiu o exemplo o 30 de agosto de 1766 no Palacio de Christiansborg - a súa esposa era Luísa de Dinamarca, e Carlos converteuse así en cuñado do seu curmán, o rei Cristián VII. O matrimonio tivo lugar a pesar do consello dado en contra, debido a acusacións de libertinaxe por parte do príncipe Carlos. Pouco despois, Carlos caeu en desacordo na corte, e a principios de 1767 el e eles tería o seu primeiro fillo, María Sofía, alí en 1767 e despois o seu segundo fillo, Guillerme, en 1769. En 1768, Carlos comprou a propiedade e vila de Offenbach-Rumpenheim á familia Edelsheim. En 1771 ampliou a mansión para converterse nun castelo e asento principesco e a súa nai María viviu no palacio ata a súa morte en 1772. En 1781, Carlos vendeu o palacio de Rumpenheim ao seu irmán menor, Carlos instalouse no castelo de Gottorp en Schleswig coa súa familia.

É considerado o fundador da Casa d'Este, tendo sido xefe da primeira familia en ser amo de Este, Alberto Azzo II foi o único fillo de Alberto Azzo I, Margrave de Milán. Herdou as oficinas dos seus pais ao redor de 1020, e aumentou continuamente as súas propiedades no norte de Italia, en 1069-1070, intentou adquirir Maine para o seu fillo Hugh, porque a súa esposa, Garsende, era coherdeira dos condes anteriores de Maine. Hugo foi declarado conde, pero non puido prevalecer contra Roberto, o duque de Normandía, na controversia da investidura entre Henrique IV, emperador do Sacro Imperio Romano Xermánico, e o papa Gregorio VII, Azzo intentou mediar, pero máis tarde uniuse ao lado do papa. Ao redor de 1073 fixo un castelo en Este a súa residencia, da cal a Casa de Este, antes do seu proxecto de construción, Este era pouco máis que unha aldea.

Foi o primeiro membro da rama Welf da Casa de Este, na xenealoxía da Casa Vella de Welf é contado como Welf IV. Welf era fillo de Azzo II de Este e da súa esposa Kunigunde de Altdorf, cando o tío materno de Welf, Welf, duque de Carintia, morreu sen fillos, Welf herdou a súa propiedade. Welf casou con Ethelind de Northeim, filla de Otón II, duque de Baviera, cando o seu sogro, o duque Otón, se converteu nun inimigo do rei Henrique IV e perdeu o seu ducado, Welf permaneceu leal ao rei. En cumprimento das ordes de Henrique, repudiou e divorciouse da súa duquesa, Ethelind, e este acontecemento tivo lugar en Goslar en 1070, cando os Estados de Baviera se someteron silenciosamente ao novo duque, que era o representante dunha das familias máis antigas da provincia. O seu repudio á duquesa, que podería considerarse un acto de inxustiza, o Papa e o emperador foron reconciliados superficialmente en 1076, pero o ano viunos de novo involucrados en hostilidades activas. Henrique, como consecuencia de repetidos actos de rebelión, declarou a Welf deposto no seu novo ducado. Con todo, apoiado polos seus fieis bávaros, e axudado polo seu pai en Italia, Welf foi capaz de manter o seu lugar, con todo, Gregorio morreu en 1085 e os seus sucesores tomaron unha parte menos intensiva nos asuntos de Alemaña. Welf, aínda adherindo ao partido da igrexa, despois do divorcio, en 1070, da súa primeira esposa, casou con Xudita de Flandres, filla de Balduíno IV, conde de Flandres, e a viúva de Tostig Godwinson, conde de Northumbria. En 1089, o fillo de Welf, Welf, casou con Matilde de Toscana, fortalecendo así as relacións co papa, con todo, despois de que Welf se divorciase de Matilde en 1095, Welf fixo emendas co rei Henrique IV e foi reconfirmado na súa posición como duque de Baviera. Despois da morte do seu pai Azzo en 1097, Welf intentou adquirir a propiedade dos seus pais ao sur dos Alpes, en 1099, Welf uniuse ao que se coñecería como a Cruzada de 1101, xunto con Guillerme IX de Aquitania, Hugo de Vermandois e Ida de Austria. O seu principal éxito foi evitar un enfrontamento entre os seus compañeiros cruzados, que estiveran saqueando territorio bizantino no seu camiño a Constantinopla, o propio Welf escapou do fiasco, pero morreu no seu camiño de volta en Pafos, Chipre, en 1101 e foi enterrado na Abadía de Weingarten.

| Follow Us<br/><br/>ARE YOU AN<br/><br/>INSIDER<br/><br/>Craving Sugar? Here's What Your Body Is Trying to Tell You<br/><br/>by<br/>Byrdie<br/><br/>PHOTO:<br/><br/>Jacquemus<br/><br/>Weight gain from out-of-control cravings aside, it can be frustrating to have a constant hankering for something unhealthy and not know why. The good news is that there's usually a reason underlying that burning desire to house a bag of potato chips, or the feeling that you might actually die if you don't get a pickle rightthisinstant (even though you're not pregnant). If you're having visions of Milky Way bars, for example, it could mean that you're missing a very specific nutrient in your diet. (Yup—it's more complicated than said chocolate bar being so darn delicious.)<br/><br/>We talked to Los Angeles–based dietitian Shira Lenchewski, M.S., R.D., to get the skinny on some common food cravings, as well as what you can do to satiate the hunger without going overboard. Keep scrolling for some seriously good information!<br/><br/>If you're craving chocolate<br/><br/>It means: You could be lacking magnesium in your diet, says Lenchewski. "Magnesium is an essential mineral involved in energy production, glucose metabolism, and muscle function. This is especially true for those hitting the gym hard," she explains. Additionally, magnesium levels lower during the pre-menstrual weeks of your period, which explains why PMS so often comes with chocolate cravings.<br/><br/>Instead, reach for high-quality, low-sugar dark chocolate, which is naturally high in magnesium. "I recommend sticking to 75 per cent cocoa or higher, and pairing it with another magnesium-rich source like sunflower seeds," says Lenchewski. She suggests the chocolate brand Hu, a small-batch food company that focuses on high-quality ingredients produced locally. "It's a little pricey, but all the more reason to keep portions in check," she says. "It's my personal favourite." We're also big fans of superfood-packed Zenbunni.<br/><br/>If you're craving candy<br/><br/>It means: "Craving pure sugar is a good indication that you're running low on energy," says Lenchewski. "Think about it. What is the one thing you're itching for after a terrible night's sleep or at around 4 p.m. during a stressful workday? The answer is usually sugar because it's used as instant fuel for our body's cells."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for apples with nut butter. "If you're raiding your co-workers' candy stash, I recommend a more slow-burn carbohydrate with a source of fat or protein," says Lenchewski. "Unlike simple sugar, this will fuel your cells while avoiding the post-sugar crash. Two options that make for great pick-me-ups the next time you're craving candy: a sliced apple with your choice of nut butter, or berries with 2% unsweetened Greek yoghurt." We like quashing a sweet tooth with these addictive coconut chips, too—they're filling, free of any added sugar, and just so good.<br/><br/>If you're craving salt<br/><br/>It means: "If nothing but the saltiest pickle will do, you may not be drinking enough H2O," says Lenchewski. "Salt helps the body hold on to water, so we crave it when we're in need of fluids."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for water. "Stay hydrated, especially as we approach the summer months," she says. The next time a craving hits, try quenching it (literally) with a few refreshing glasses and you might find the urgency to sodium binge disappears. "If plain water bores you, try adding in mint, lemon, or frozen fruit to mix it up," says Lenchewski. And if that still doesn't do the trick, there's a healthier alternative to bagged chips or fries. "If you're really just craving salt after all, toasted seaweed is a great low-calorie option," she says.<br/><br/>If you're craving starchy carbs like pasta<br/><br/>It means: "Because high-carb foods boost the feel-good hormone serotonin, starch cravings can be a sign you're in need of a mood booster," says Lenchewski.<br/><br/>Instead, reach for a bath! "Bust out the Epsom salts, because it's time for some serious R+R," says Lenchewski. "Trust me. Indulging in a starch free-for-all feels really good in the moment, but it will likely bum you out more the next day." (As anyone who has ever over-indulged a pizza or pasta craving knows.) So the next time you want to dive head first into a bowl of carbs, draw a bath, light a candle, and treat yourself without any regret or dense calories.<br/><br/>If you're craving ice cream<br/><br/>5 / 6<br/><br/>It means: "Your body may be telling you it's in need of some healthy fat."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for coconut ice cream. "I'm a realist, so if you're craving ice cream, I'm not going to recommend a handful of walnuts, which are, of course, full of healthy fat," says Lenchewski. "For ice cream emergencies, I recommend lower-in-sugar coconut ice-creams like Coconut Bliss or Kippy's three-ingredient ice cream in Los Angeles." We can vouch for the fact that coconut ice cream tastes incredible and just like the real thing.<br/><br/>If you're craving a burger<br/><br/>It means: You need iron. "If you can't stop thinking about red meat, there's a chance your body is craving iron, b12 and folic acid," says Lenchewski. "This is especially true during or around that time of the month."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for a healthier burger. "I'm a proponent of grass fed, antibiotic and hormone-free red meat once a week," says Lenchewski. "Try experimenting with an open-faced bison burger—which, cut for cut, is leaner and has more iron than beef." Don't eat meat? Try to incorporate some kind of plant-based iron supplement into your routine, like spirulina. | Síguenos<br/><br/>É vostede un<br/><br/>INSIDER<br/><br/>Querendo azucre? Isto é o que o seu corpo está tentando dicirche<br/><br/>por<br/>Byrdie<br/><br/>FOTO:<br/><br/>Jacquemus<br/><br/>Gaño de peso de apetitos fóra de control, pode ser frustrante ter un anhelo constante por algo insalubre e non saber por que. A boa noticia é que adoita haber unha razón subxacente a ese desexo ardente de albergar unha bolsa de patacas fritas, ou a sensación de que realmente pode morrer se non obtén un picles neste momento (aínda que non está embarazada). Se estás tendo visións de barras da Vía Láctea, por exemplo, pode significar que estás perdendo un nutriente moi específico na túa dieta. (Si, é máis complicado que dito barra de chocolate ser tan maldito delicioso.)<br/><br/>Falamos coa dietista dos Ánxeles Shira Lenchewski, M.S., R.D., para obter o magro sobre algúns antollos de comida comúns, así como o que podes facer para saciar a fame sen ir ao mar. Siga desprazando para algunha información seriamente boa!<br/><br/>Se queres o chocolate<br/><br/>Significa: Podería faltar magnesio na súa dieta, di Lenchewski. "O magnesio é un mineral esencial implicado na produción de enerxía, o metabolismo da glicosa e a función muscular. Isto é especialmente certo para aqueles que golpean o ximnasio con forza", explica. Ademais, os niveis de magnesio baixan durante as semanas premenstruais do seu período, o que explica por que o síndrome premenstrual adoita vir con ganas de chocolate.<br/><br/>En vez diso, busque chocolate negro de alta calidade e baixo azucre, que é naturalmente alto en magnesio. "Recomendo que se pegue ao 75% de cacao ou máis, e emparellalo con outra fonte rica en magnesio como sementes de xirasol", di Lenchewski. Ela suxire a marca de chocolate Hu, unha empresa de alimentos de pequeno lote que se centra en ingredientes de alta calidade producidos localmente. "É un pouco caro, pero aínda máis razón para manter as porcións baixo control", di. "É o meu favorito persoal". Tamén somos grandes fans de superalimentos Zenbunni.<br/><br/>Se queres caramelos<br/><br/>Significa: "O anhelo de azucre puro é unha boa indicación de que te estás quedando sen enerxía", di Lenchewski. "Pensa nisto. Cal é a única cousa que che apetece despois dunha terrible noite de sono ou arredor das 4 da tarde durante unha xornada laboral estresante? A resposta é xeralmente o azucre porque se usa como combustible instantáneo para as células do noso corpo.<br/><br/>"Se está invadindo a reserva de doces dos seus compañeiros de traballo, recomendo un carbohidrato de queima máis lenta cunha fonte de graxa ou proteína", di Lenchewski. A diferenza do azucre simple, isto alimentará as túas células ao mesmo tempo que evita o accidente post-azucre. Dúas opcións que fan grandes pick-me-ups a próxima vez que anhela doces: unha mazá rebanada coa súa elección de manteiga de noces, ou bagas con 2% de iogur grego sen azucre. Gústanos borrar un doce con estes adictivos chips de coco, tamén - eles están enchendo, libre de calquera azucre engadido, e tan bo.<br/><br/>Se queres o sal<br/><br/>Significa: "Se non fai máis que o pepino máis salgado, é posible que non estea bebendo suficiente H2O", di Lenchewski. "O sal axuda ao corpo a reter auga, polo que o anhelamos cando necesitamos fluídos".<br/><br/>"Mantéñase hidratado, especialmente a medida que nos achegamos aos meses de verán", di ela. A próxima vez que un anhelo golpea, intente apagá-lo (literalmente) con uns vasos refrescantes e pode atopar a urxencia de binge sodio desaparece. "Se a auga normal aburre, intente engadir menta, limón ou froita conxelada para mesturala", di Lenchewski. E se iso aínda non fai o truco, hai unha alternativa máis saudable ás patacas fritas ensacadas ou patacas fritas. "Se realmente só queres sal despois de todo, as algas tostadas son unha gran opción baixa en calorías", di ela.<br/><br/>Se queres hidratos de carbono como a pasta<br/><br/>Significa: "Debido a que os alimentos ricos en carbohidratos aumentan a hormona serotonina, os antollos de amidón poden ser un sinal de que necesitas un refuerzo do estado de ánimo", di Lenchewski.<br/><br/>En vez diso, busque un baño! "Expulsa os sales de Epsom, porque é hora de algo serio R + R", di Lenchewski. "Confía en min. Deleitarse cun amidón libre para todos se sente realmente ben no momento, pero é probable que che estropee máis ao día seguinte". (Como calquera que xamais se deleitaron con unha pizza ou pasta anhelo sabe.) Así que a próxima vez que quere mergullar cabeza primeiro nun bol de carbohidratos, debuxar un baño, acender unha vela, e tratar-se sen ningún arrepentimento ou calorías densas.<br/><br/>Se queres un xeado<br/><br/>5 / 6<br/><br/>Significa: "O teu corpo pode estar dicindo que necesita algunha graxa saudable".<br/><br/>"Son un realista, polo que se queres xeado, non vou recomendar un puñado de noces, que están, por suposto, cheas de graxa saudable", di Lenchewski. "Para emerxencias de xeados, recomendo xeados de coco de baixo azucre como Coconut Bliss ou o xeado de tres ingredientes de Kippy en Los Angeles." Podemos garantir o feito de que o xeado de coco ten un sabor incrible e semellante ao real.<br/><br/>Se queres unha hamburguesa<br/><br/>Significa: necesitas ferro. "Se non podes deixar de pensar na carne vermella, hai unha posibilidade de que o teu corpo estea desexando ferro, b12 e ácido fólico", di Lenchewski. "Isto é especialmente certo durante ou ao redor daquela época do mes".<br/><br/>En vez diso, busque unha hamburguesa máis saudable. "Son un defensor da carne vermella alimentada con herba, antibióticos e libre de hormonas unha vez por semana", di Lenchewski. "Probe experimentar cunha hamburguesa de bisontes de cara aberta, que, cortada para cortar, é máis delgada e ten máis ferro que a carne de vaca". Trate de incorporar algún tipo de suplemento de ferro a base de plantas na súa rutina, como a espirulina. |

Even history has witnessed some of the greatest internet security gone kaput by the hands of hackers, who have easily got away too. The only way to curb such crime is to remain aware of the cyber laws that we have today, that can either be through internet or through website/IT vendors.
