In simple terms, the condition is characterized by: one develops a kidney disease and undergoes a kidney transplant and other diseases associated with acidic concentration in the blood and gout. In theory, the condition will occur even if the genetic change is inherited from one parent and sporadically occurs when there is no family history.<br/><br/>Common names of autosomal dominant interstitial kidney disease<br/><br/>The condition has other names as well namely: medullary cystic kidney disease, although this name is not used as much because most people suffering from this condition do not have medullary cysts. It is also referred to as juvenile hyperuricemic nephropathy. The disease tends to affect people of ages 20 to 50. The latter condition as aforementioned occurs in young children, something, which translate to get it from both parents.<br/>Cystic kidney disease is an inherited condition whereby the cysts in the centre of each kidney gradually lose their ability to function properly. Cysts refer to abnormal blisters of fluid in the kidney. The condition further scares the kidney making unable to concentrate the urine and as a result, producing too much urine. Its symptoms include excessive urination, salt cravings, weakness, confusion, bleeding, fatigue, frequent hiccups, low blood pressure, nausea and vomiting, headaches, pale skin, reduced sensation in the hands, weight loss among many others. Other complications include: anemia, ulcers, loss of bone density, infertility and other heart related problems.<br/>Its analysis incorporates blood tests to check for sodium levels and general kidney functions, urine tests to check the levels of concentration and other imbalances, x rays to check for the size of kidneys that may be altered owing to increased urine concentrations, renal biopsy and genetic testing to verify any genetic changes that might have taken place in due time.<br/>While the disease does not have a cut and dry treatment to it, one may focus on controlling measures, which include intake of fluids and salt to supplement the one lost as the disease progresses into latter stages. This also helps reduce dehydration. Other treatments include taking of prescribed medication and diet changes and minimal intakes of foods containing phosphorous and potassium. Further complications may also require one to have a kidney transplant. Basically, this is not a curable disease but rather a manageable once detected in the early stages.<br/><br/>The common yet different factor of Autosomal dominant interstitial kidney disease<br/><br/>Nephronophthisis and medullary cystic kidney disease are mainly grouped together because, in essence, they share the same features but with a slight difference in regards inheritance patterns to the former affecting children and the latter affecting young adults and older age groups. Similar features for both are ADH resistant urine concentration that leads to polyuria and polydipsia, anemia and renal diseases.<br/>The former aforementioned condition is Autosomal recessive accounting to 15% of chronic diseases and causes ESRD during early childhood while the latter is Autosomal dominant with a few sporadic new mutations and causes ESRD for people between the ages of 30 and 50. | Blog de certificación de RCP en liña<br/><br/>Data: 23 de xullo de 2014<br/><br/>A enfermidade autosómica intersticial dominante é unha colección rara de enfermidades que afectan ás funcións coñecidas do ril. En termos simples, a condición caracterízase por: un desenvolve unha enfermidade renal e sofre un transplante de ril e outras enfermidades asociadas coa concentración ácida no sangue e gota. En teoría, a condición ocorrerá mesmo se o cambio xenético é herdado dun dos pais e ocorre esporádicamente cando non hai antecedentes familiares.<br/><br/>Nomes comúns de enfermidade autosómica intersticial dominante<br/><br/>A afección tamén ten outros nomes, a saber: enfermidade medular dos riles quísticos, aínda que este nome non se usa tanto porque a maioría das persoas que sofren desta afección non teñen quistes medulares. Tamén se coñece como nefropatía hiperuricémica xuvenil. A enfermidade adoita afectar ás persoas de 20 a 50 anos. Esta última condición, como se mencionou anteriormente, ocorre nos nenos pequenos, algo que se traduce para obtelo de ambos os pais.<br/>A enfermidade renal quística é unha condición hereditaria pola cal os quistes no centro de cada ril perden gradualmente a súa capacidade de funcionar correctamente. A condición asusta aínda máis o ril facendo incapaz de concentrar a orina e, como resultado, producindo demasiada orina. Os seus síntomas inclúen micción excesiva, antollos de sal, debilidade, confusión, sangramento, fatiga, soluzos frecuentes, presión arterial baixa, náuseas e vómitos, dores de cabeza, pel pálida, sensación reducida nas mans, perda de peso entre moitos outros. Outras complicacións inclúen: anemia, úlceras, perda de densidade ósea, infertilidade e outros problemas relacionados co corazón.<br/>A súa análise incorpora análises de sangue para comprobar os niveis de sodio e as funcións xerais dos riles, probas de ouriña para comprobar os niveis de concentración e outros desequilibrios, raios X para comprobar o tamaño dos riles que poden ser alterados debido ao aumento das concentracións de ouriños, biopsia renal e probas xenéticas para verificar calquera cambio xenético que puidera ter lugar a tempo.<br/>Aínda que a enfermidade non ten un tratamento seco e seco, pódese centrar en medidas de control, que inclúen a inxestión de fluídos e sal para complementar a que se perdeu a medida que a enfermidade avanza nas últimas etapas. Isto tamén axuda a reducir a deshidratación. Outros tratamentos inclúen a toma de medicamentos prescritos e cambios na dieta e inxestións mínimas de alimentos que conteñen fósforo e potasio. Outras complicacións tamén poden requirir un transplante de ril. Básicamente, esta non é unha enfermidade curable, senón que se pode xestionar unha vez detectada nas primeiras etapas.<br/><br/>Factor común pero diferente da enfermidade autosómica intersticial dominante<br/><br/>A nefronoftise e a enfermidade renal quística medular agrúpanse principalmente porque, en esencia, comparten as mesmas características, pero cunha lixeira diferenza nos patróns de herdanza respecto aos primeiros que afectan aos nenos e aos últimos que afectan aos adultos novos e aos grupos de idade máis vellos. Características similares para ambos son a concentración de ouriños resistentes ao ADH que leva á poliuria e polidipsia, anemia e enfermidades renais.<br/>A primeira condición mencionada é a autosómica recesiva que representa o 15% das enfermidades crónicas e causa ESRD durante a primeira infancia, mentres que a segunda é autosómica dominante con algunhas novas mutacións esporádicas e causa ESRD para persoas entre as idades de 30 e 50 anos. |
| Hobbes' vs. Locke's Account on the State of Nature<br/><br/>Topic: PhilosophyWords: 2539Pages: 9Aug 3rd, 2021<br/><br/>Hobbes and Locke are among the most influential political philosophers to ever write in English. The state of nature, which precedes the organization of the complex societies, is the common premise that both Hobbes and Locke share but interpret in different ways. The former views humans in their natural state as equally dangerous and free to pursue their egoistic goals unrestricted by the nonexistent notions of justice, which is why his natural state amounts to the "war of every man against every man" (Hobbes76). The latter, on the other hand, views humans in their original condition as equally valuable and restricts natural freedom by the idea of justice that requires not to harm others, which allows defining the state of nature as "mutual assistance and preservation" rather than war (Locke 15). The key difference between the two philosophers' accounts of natural state is that Locke uses ethical considerations while Hobbes does not, and it ultimately leads Hobbes to envisage a state exercising unlimited power over human beings, while Locke limits the government by the moral principles, which he considers a natural law.<br/><br/>Hobbes bases his assumptions regarding the state of nature on the fact that all people are roughly equal in their physical and mental capabilities. He admits that some individuals may demonstrate greater physical strength or superior intellect but insists that "when all is reckoned together, the difference between man and man is not so considerable" (Hobbes 74). Since humans are roughly equal in their capabilities, they also have similar hopes to attain their ends and satisfy their needs (Hobbes 75). As a logical outcome of this equality, when the people begin competing for scarce resources, no one may feel entirely secure in his or her possessions. Even if a mighty, cunning, and capable person succeeds in subjugating "the persons of all men he can," it still does not guarantee the ultimate security (Hobbes 75). As no human can obtain such superiority over the others that renders him or her utterly immune to their strength of intellect, no human can feel completely safe when surrounded by his or her equals. Hobbes' equality in the natural state is equality of fear, where all humans view each other as dangerous competitors.<br/><br/>Just as Hobbes, Locke considers all human beings to be fundamentally equal, but assigns a very different meaning to the term. From his perspective, it is not the equality of capabilities, but, rather, the equality of value. He opines that the people "promiscuously born to all the same advantages of nature" should logically enjoy the perfect equality among them, as there is no reason to consider anyone inherently more valuable (Locke 8). The only possible foundation for designating some people as superior to others would be if God "by any manifest declaration of his will, set one above another" (Locke 8). Since such divine sanction of superiority is absent, Locke concludes that the natural equality of all representatives of humankind is not to be called into question. Hobbes approaches equality pragmatically and stresses that people in their natural state are equally dangerous, but Locke employs an ethical approach and emphasizes that humans are equally valuable in God's eyes. This disagreement is but the first difference between the two authors based on the fact that Locke includes God as a premise into his political philosophy, while Hobbes does not.<br/><br/>Another characteristic feature of Hobbes' account of the natural state is his interpretation of liberty. According to Hobbes, the state of nature implies unlimited freedom to do whatever is necessary for one's continued existence. The philosopher defines liberty as "the absence of external impediments" in using one's abilities to attain one's goals (Hobbes 79). The primary purpose of every sentient being is to maintain its continued existence. As a consequence, Hobbesian freedom amounts to the unhindered opportunity to do anything that, in one's judgment, would be best suited to preserve one's life and possessions (Hobbes 79). The only limitation to liberty is that a person cannot do anything contradictory to sustaining his or her life or destroying "the means of preserving the same" (Hobbes 79). Apart from that, there are no boundaries, and everyone has "a right to everything, even to one another's body" if that furthers one's survival (Hobbes 80). Thus, natural liberty, as viewed by Hobbes, is the absence of externally enforced obstacles in pursuing one's right to everything to sustain and secure one's continued existence.<br/><br/>Locke also upholds the idea of natural liberty but, unsurprisingly, approaches it in a manner that is significantly different from that of Hobbes. As soon as he begins discussing liberty in the state of nature, he immediately notes that a state of freedom does not equate "a state of license" (Locke 9). The philosopher identifies two specific limitations to human freedom in the state of nature. The first one is identical to that introduce by Hobbes: however free and independent, a person nevertheless "has not liberty to destroy himself" (Locke 9). Yet the second limitation contradicts Hobbes' prepositions directly. According to Locke, every human being has a natural obligation not to "harm another in his life, health, liberty, or possessions" (9). Just as with his interpretation of equality, the author bases this assertion on ethical and religious grounds: people should preserve each other's existence since they are all creations of the same "omnipotent, and infinitely wise maker" (Locke 9). Thus, Locke's limits liberty in the natural state far more stringently than Hobbes by introducing the obligation to refrain from harming both oneself and the others.<br/><br/>The differences between the two authors also manifest in their accounts of justice in the natural state of humanity. As far as Hobbes is concerned, delineating just and unjust practices is merely the matter of the law. There is no jurisprudence in the state of nature, and the only law governing human beings in their original condition is a natural law that only obliges them to seek personal security. As a result, nothing can be unjust in the original state of the humankind: "notions of right and wrong justice and injustice" have no place and no meaning in the absence of the stringently enforced law (Hobbes 78). As long as the people use their virtually unlimited freedom to ruthlessly compete with each other for resources, to which they are equally entitled, they have no criteria to differentiate between just and unjust actions. Therefore, the Hobbesian state of nature defies the very idea of justice since the author interprets it as a mere function of the formalized and established law.<br/><br/>Locke assigns different meaning to justice and views it not so much in legislative as in the ethical terms. This paper already mentioned that, unlike Hobbes, Locke employs ethical notions and generally bases his political philosophy on moral rather than purely practical presumptions. Locke's natural law, unlike that of Hobbes, obliges human beings to take care of each other rather than simply leaving everyone to fend for themselves. As a result, there is a place for justice and injustice in his state of nature. The author points to this fact himself when noting that no one should deprive another of his or her life of the means of preserving it "unless it be to do justice on an offender" (Locke 9). This statement reveals with the utmost clarity that, according to Locke, there is justice in the state of nature, and, moreover, humans have to preserve it actively. The criterion of justice, which Hobbes' natural state lacks, is the second limitation on natural liberty imposed by Locke: an action is unjust if it constitutes an unwarranted threat to another person's life and possessions.<br/><br/>These differences in the two authors' treatment of equality, liberty, and justice or injustice culminate in their interpretation of the relationship between the state of nature and the state of war. From Hobbes's perspective, the two are synonymous, because the ruthless competition is the only logical outcome of putting people with equivalent capabilities and similar needs in an environment with limited resources. He states this connection outright: "if any two men desire the same thing, which nevertheless they cannot both enjoy, they become enemies" and are, therefore, in the state of war with each other (Hobbes 75). Yet since humans are numerous and all possess similar capabilities and needs, this competition manifests not only in the individual interactions but also on the level of humanity as a whole. As long as all humans have equal and unlimited rights to all resources and even to each other's bodies and lives, the state of nature is a war of "every man against every man" (Hobbes 76). This grim interpretation stems directly from Hobbes' portrayal of the state of nature as governed solely by the individuals' egoistic urges.<br/><br/>Locke, on the other hand, differentiates between the state of nature and the state of war and points out that, while they may occur simultaneously, it is no reason to identify one with the other. Locke's definition of the state of war is virtually identical to that offered by Hobbes. According to Locke, "he who attempts to get another man into his absolute power does thereby put himself into a state of war with him" (14). This explanation lines up perfectly with the Hobbesian notion that everyone's universal right to everything, including the other people's bodies and lives, leads to the state of war. Yet Locke refuses to equate the state of war and the state of nature precisely because he denies Hobbes' interpretation of natural freedom. Since Locke's natural state restrains people from harming each other through the second limitation of liberty, an attempt on another person's freedom is a transgression against the natural law. While for Hobbes, war is the humankind's condition by default, Locke portrays it as a perversion of the state of nature rather than its rule.<br/><br/>These differences in delineating the state on nature and its constituents, such as liberty, equality, justice, and war, pave the way to the authors contrasting portrayals of government. Based on his pessimistic assessment of the state of nature, the author of Leviathan concludes that, under conditions of war, there can be no definite hope for "living out the time which nature ordinarily alloweth men to live" (Hobbes 80). The solution is laying down the universal right to everything and leaving everyone "so much liberty against other men, as he would allow other men against himself" (Hobbes 80). The participants of the resulting social contract invest the unlimited liberties they have surrendered into a sovereign – the bearer of the supreme power whose purpose is to preserve the achieved status quo by punishing all transgressions against it. Sovereign's power is absolute: the ruler has the authority "to do whatsoever he shall think necessary" to promote peace between his subjects so that no one would assail another's life or property (113). Hobbes concludes that without such an unassailable figure entitled with the right to do anything to the subjects, there can be no peace and no guarantee of security.<br/><br/>While Locke agrees with the necessity of creating politically organized societies, he nevertheless opposes Hobbes' idea of the sovereign power as unlimited and unassailable. As mentioned above, Locke's state of nature is not nearly as dreadful as that painted by Hobbes because of the people's obligation to preserve not only themselves but each other as well. Therefore, the need for social contract arises not from the fear of the others, but from the sheer convenience. Small communities may not need numerous laws to solve conflicts and "officers to superintend the process," but larger associations find it advisable to institute governments for that purpose (Locke 57). Yet the power of the government cannot be unlimited because it would result in subduing the subjects to an "inconstant, uncertain, unknown, arbitrary will of another man" (Locke 17). Such a government would constitute a twofold violation of the natural law. By agreeing to another person's absolute power over his life, a subject would violate its first limitation prohibiting to harm oneself. As for the ruler, destroying another person's liberty would constitute direct harm and, as such, be contradictory to the second limitation.<br/><br/>As a direct continuation of his case for unlimited governmental authority, Hobbes denies the separation of powers as a principle. From his perspective, the sovereign, once instituted, possesses "the whole power of prescribing the rules" governing the lives of the subjects or, in shorter terms, the legislative power (Hobbes 114). The sovereign also reserves the right of "hearing and deciding all controversies" – that is, the judicial power (Hobbes 114). Finally, since the entire purpose of the sovereign is to force the subjects to refrain from harming each other, there can be no doubt that executive power is also his or her exclusive prerogative. The separation of powers as a concept is alien to Hobbes because of his views on the state of nature. Creating a political entity where the executive, legislative, and judicial branches would check each other – that is, compete – would mean recreating the Hobbesian state of nature-as-war on a higher level. Since the people enter a social contract and institute a government to put the state of nature behind them, not reinstate it in a different form, the separation of powers contradictory Hobbes' views directly.<br/><br/>Locke, on the other hand, embraces separation of power as a foundational principle of his political theory. His case for the separation is evident in the discussion of the limits of the legislative power. As Locke puts it, it would be hardly advisable "for the same persons, who have the power of making laws, to have also in their hands the power to execute them" (76). The philosopher points to the imperfections of human nature and the inherent desire to "grasp at power" as a rationale for this precautionary measure (Locke 76). Just as in Hobbes' case, Locke's account of the separation of powers stems directly from his interpretation of the state of nature. If there is already justice in the state of nature and the people can understand it, any government is inevitably subject to the same natural law. Since absolute power over people violates both limitations of this law, separating and distributing it is advisable so that the government would function appropriately.<br/><br/>This paper has demonstrated that, while the differences between Hobbes' and Locke's accounts of the natural state of humanity are numerous, they ultimately amount to the presence of absence of moral premises. Hobbes views the natural state as that of unlimited liberty, where people endowed with equal capabilities and not bound by any moral notions, such as justice, compete for the resources unceasingly. Locke, however, interprets equality and liberty ethically rather than practically and opines that war is a perversion of the natural state, as the natural law obliges humans not to harm each other. This disagreement influences the philosophers' approaches to government. Hobbes insists on an all-powerful ruler, as, in the absence of ethical restraints, no other authority could force the humans to refrain from harming each other. Yet, in Locke's view, granting the government unlimited powers would be contradictory to the ethical limitations embedded in the law of nature, which is why he, unlike Hobbes, advocates separation of powers. | Relato de Hobbes vs. Locke sobre o estado da natureza<br/><br/>Tema: FilosofíaPalabras: 2539Páxinas: 9Aug 3rd, 2021<br/><br/>Hobbes e Locke están entre os filósofos políticos máis influentes en escribir en inglés. O estado da natureza, que precede á organización das sociedades complexas, é a premisa común que tanto Hobbes como Locke comparten pero interpretan de maneiras diferentes. Os primeiros ven aos humanos no seu estado natural como igualmente perigosos e libres para perseguir os seus obxectivos egoístas sen restricións polas nocións inexistentes de xustiza, razón pola cal o seu estado natural equivale á "guerra de todo home contra todo home" (Hobbes 76). Este último, por outra banda, ve aos humanos na súa condición orixinal como igualmente valiosos e restrinxe a liberdade natural pola idea de xustiza que require non prexudicar aos demais, o que permite definir o estado da natureza como "asistencia e preservación mutua" en lugar da guerra (Locke 15). A diferenza clave entre os relatos dos dous filósofos sobre o estado natural é que Locke usa consideracións éticas mentres que Hobbes non o fai, e finalmente leva a Hobbes a prever un estado que exerza un poder ilimitado sobre os seres humanos, mentres Locke limita o goberno polos principios morais, que considera unha lei natural.<br/><br/>Hobbes basea as súas suposicións sobre o estado da natureza no feito de que todas as persoas son aproximadamente iguais nas súas capacidades físicas e mentais. Admite que algúns individuos poden demostrar unha maior forza física ou un intelecto superior, pero insiste en que "cando todo se ten en conta, a diferenza entre o home e o home non é tan considerable" (Hobbes 74). Dado que os seres humanos son aproximadamente iguais nas súas capacidades, tamén teñen esperanzas similares de alcanzar os seus fins e satisfacer as súas necesidades (Hobbes 75). Como resultado lóxico desta igualdade, cando a xente comeza a competir por recursos escasos, ninguén pode sentirse completamente seguro nas súas posesións. Mesmo se unha persoa poderosa, astuta e capaz logra subxugar "as persoas de todos os homes que pode", aínda non garante a seguridade definitiva (Hobbes 75). Como ningún ser humano pode obter tal superioridade sobre os demais que o fai totalmente inmune á súa forza de intelecto, ningún ser humano pode sentirse completamente seguro cando está rodeado dos seus iguais. A igualdade de Hobbes no estado natural é a igualdade do medo, onde todos os humanos se ven como competidores perigosos.<br/><br/>Do mesmo xeito que Hobbes, Locke considera que todos os seres humanos son fundamentalmente iguais, pero asigna un significado moi diferente ao termo. Desde a súa perspectiva, non é a igualdade de capacidades, senón, máis ben, a igualdade de valor. Opina que as persoas "promiscuamente nacidas con todas as mesmas vantaxes da natureza" deberían gozar loxicamente da perfecta igualdade entre elas, xa que non hai razón para considerar a ninguén inherentemente máis valioso (Locke 8). O único fundamento posible para designar a algunhas persoas como superiores a outras sería que Deus "por calquera declaración manifesta da súa vontade, puidese poñer un por riba do outro" (Locke 8). Dado que tal sanción divina de superioridade está ausente, Locke conclúe que a igualdade natural de todos os representantes da humanidade non debe ser cuestionada. Hobbes aborda pragmaticamente a igualdade e enfatiza que as persoas no seu estado natural son igualmente perigosas, pero Locke emprega un enfoque ético e enfatiza que os humanos son igualmente valiosos aos ollos de Deus. Este desacordo non é máis que a primeira diferenza entre os dous autores baseada no feito de que Locke inclúe a Deus como premisa na súa filosofía política, mentres que Hobbes non o fai.<br/><br/>Outra característica do relato de Hobbes sobre o estado natural é a súa interpretación da liberdade. Segundo Hobbes, o estado de natureza implica liberdade ilimitada para facer o que sexa necesario para a existencia continuada. O filósofo define a liberdade como a "ausencia de impedimentos externos" no uso das propias habilidades para alcanzar os seus obxectivos (Hobbes 79). Como consecuencia, a liberdade hobbesiana equivale á oportunidade sen obstáculos de facer calquera cousa que, no seu xuízo, sería máis axeitada para preservar a propia vida e posesións (Hobbes 79). A única limitación á liberdade é que unha persoa non pode facer nada contradictorio para manter a súa vida ou destruír "os medios de preservar a mesma" (Hobbes 79). Ademais diso, non hai límites, e todos teñen "dereito a todo, mesmo ao corpo do outro" se iso favorece a supervivencia (Hobbes 80). Así, a liberdade natural, tal como a ve Hobbes, é a ausencia de obstáculos forzados externamente na procura do seu dereito a todo para manter e asegurar a súa existencia continuada.<br/><br/>Locke tamén defende a idea da liberdade natural, pero, sen sorpresa, a aborda dunha maneira significativamente diferente á de Hobbes. Tan pronto como comeza a discutir a liberdade no estado de natureza, observa inmediatamente que un estado de liberdade non equivale a "un estado de licenza" (Locke 9). A primeira é idéntica á introdución de Hobbes: por libre e independente que sexa, unha persoa non obstante "non ten liberdade para destruírse a si mesma" (Locke 9). Segundo Locke, todo ser humano ten unha obrigación natural de non "prexudicar a outro na súa vida, saúde, liberdade ou posesións". Do mesmo xeito que coa súa interpretación da igualdade, o autor basea esta afirmación en motivos éticos e relixiosos: as persoas deben preservar a existencia do outro, xa que son todas creacións do mesmo "omnipotente e infinitamente sabio creador" (Locke 9). Así, Locke limita a liberdade no estado natural moito máis estritamente que Hobbes introducindo a obriga de absterse de prexudicarse a si mesmo e aos demais.<br/><br/>As diferenzas entre os dous autores tamén se manifestan nas súas contas da xustiza no estado natural da humanidade. No que respecta a Hobbes, delinear prácticas xustas e inxustas é simplemente cuestión de lei. Non hai xurisprudencia no estado de natureza, e a única lei que rexe aos seres humanos na súa condición orixinal é unha lei natural que só os obriga a buscar seguridade persoal. Como resultado, nada pode ser inxusto no estado orixinal da humanidade: "as nocións de xustiza e inxustiza correctas e incorrectas" non teñen lugar nin significado en ausencia da lei rigorosamente aplicada (Hobbes 78). Mentres a xente use a súa liberdade virtualmente ilimitada para competir sen piedade entre si polos recursos, aos que teñen igual dereito, non teñen criterios para diferenciar entre accións xustas e inxustas. Polo tanto, o estado de natureza hobbesiano desafía a propia idea de xustiza, xa que o autor a interpreta como unha mera función da lei formalizada e establecida.<br/><br/>Locke atribúe un significado diferente á xustiza e a ve non tanto en termos lexislativos como en termos éticos. Este artigo xa mencionou que, a diferenza de Hobbes, Locke emprega nocións éticas e xeralmente basea a súa filosofía política en presuncións morais máis que puramente prácticas. A lei natural de Locke, a diferenza da de Hobbes, obriga aos seres humanos a coidarse uns dos outros en lugar de simplemente deixar que todos se defendan por si mesmos. Como resultado, hai un lugar para a xustiza e a inxustiza no seu estado de natureza. O propio autor sinala este feito ao sinalar que ninguén debe privar a outra da súa vida dos medios de preservala "a non ser para facer xustiza a un delincuente" (Locke 9). Esta afirmación revela con máxima claridade que, segundo Locke, hai xustiza no estado da natureza, e, ademais, os humanos teñen que preservala activamente. O criterio da xustiza, que carece do estado natural de Hobbes, é a segunda limitación á liberdade natural imposta por Locke: unha acción é inxusta se constitúe unha ameaza inxustificada para a vida e as posesións doutra persoa.<br/><br/>Estas diferenzas no tratamento dos dous autores da igualdade, liberdade e xustiza ou inxustiza culminan na súa interpretación da relación entre o estado de natureza e o estado de guerra. Desde a perspectiva de Hobbes, os dous son sinónimos, porque a competencia despiadada é o único resultado lóxico de poñer persoas con capacidades equivalentes e necesidades similares nun ambiente con recursos limitados. Afirma esta conexión directamente: "se dous homes desexan a mesma cousa, que non obstante ambos non poden gozar, convértense en inimigos" e, polo tanto, están en estado de guerra entre si (Hobbes 75). Con todo, dado que os seres humanos son numerosos e todos posúen capacidades e necesidades similares, esta competencia maniféstase non só nas interaccións individuais senón tamén a nivel da humanidade no seu conxunto. Mentres todos os seres humanos teñan dereitos iguais e ilimitados a todos os recursos e mesmo aos corpos e vidas dos demais, o estado da natureza é unha guerra de "todo home contra todo home" (Hobbes 76). Esta sombría interpretación provén directamente da representación de Hobbes do estado da natureza gobernado unicamente polos impulsos egoístas dos individuos.<br/><br/>Locke, por outra banda, diferencia entre o estado de natureza e o estado de guerra e sinala que, aínda que poidan ocorrer simultaneamente, non é motivo para identificarse un co outro. A definición de Locke do estado de guerra é virtualmente idéntica á ofrecida por Hobbes. Segundo Locke, "aquel que intenta levar a outro home ao seu poder absoluto ponse así a si mesmo nun estado de guerra con el" (14). Esta explicación concuerda perfectamente coa noción hobbesiana de que o dereito universal de todos a todo, incluídos os corpos e as vidas dos demais, leva ao estado de guerra. Con todo, Locke rexeita equiparar o estado de guerra e o estado da natureza precisamente porque nega a interpretación de Hobbes da liberdade natural. Dado que o estado natural de Locke impide que as persoas se prexudiquen entre si a través da segunda limitación da liberdade, un intento contra a liberdade doutra persoa é unha transgresión contra a lei natural. Mentres que para Hobbes a guerra é a condición da humanidade por defecto, Locke a retrata como unha perversión do estado da natureza en lugar do seu dominio.<br/><br/>Estas diferenzas en delinear o estado sobre a natureza e os seus constituíntes, como a liberdade, a igualdade, a xustiza e a guerra, abren o camiño aos autores que contrastan as representacións do goberno. Baseándose na súa avaliación pesimista do estado da natureza, o autor do Leviatán conclúe que, en condicións de guerra, non pode haber unha esperanza definitiva de "vivir o tempo que a natureza ordinariamente permite aos homes vivir" (Hobbes 80). A solución é establecer o dereito universal a todo e deixar a todos "tan liberdade contra outros homes, como permitiría a outros homes contra si mesmo" (Hobbes 80). Os participantes do contrato social resultante invisten as liberdades ilimitadas que cederon nun soberano, o portador do poder supremo cuxo propósito é preservar o status quo alcanzado castigando todas as transgresións contra el. O poder do soberano é absoluto: o gobernante ten a autoridade "para facer todo o que crea necesario" para promover a paz entre os seus súbditos, de xeito que ninguén asaltaría a vida ou a propiedade doutro. Hobbes conclúe que sen unha figura tan inatacable con dereito a facer algo aos súbditos, non pode haber paz nin garantía de seguridade.<br/><br/>Aínda que Locke está de acordo coa necesidade de crear sociedades politicamente organizadas, non obstante se opón á idea de Hobbes do poder soberano como ilimitado e inatacable. Como se mencionou anteriormente, o estado de natureza de Locke non é tan terrible como o pintado por Hobbes debido á obrigación do pobo de preservar non só a si mesmos, senón tamén a uns a outros. Polo tanto, a necesidade do contrato social non xorde do medo aos demais, senón da mera conveniencia. As pequenas comunidades poden non necesitar numerosas leis para resolver conflitos e "oficiais para supervisar o proceso", pero as asociacións máis grandes consideran aconsellable instituir gobernos para ese propósito (Locke 57). Con todo, o poder do goberno non pode ser ilimitado porque resultaría en someter os súbditos a unha "vontade inconstante, incerta, descoñecida, arbitraria doutro home" (Locke 17). Tal goberno constituiría unha dobre violación da lei natural. Ao aceptar o poder absoluto doutra persoa sobre a súa vida, un suxeito violaría a súa primeira limitación prohibindo facerse dano a si mesmo. En canto ao gobernante, a destrución da liberdade doutra persoa constitúe un dano directo e, como tal, é contraria á segunda limitación.<br/><br/>Como unha continuación directa do seu argumento para a autoridade gobernamental ilimitada, Hobbes nega a separación de poderes como un principio. Desde a súa perspectiva, o soberano, unha vez instituido, posúe "todo o poder de prescribir as regras" que rexen a vida dos súbditos ou, en termos máis curtos, o poder lexislativo (Hobbes 114). O soberano tamén se reserva o dereito de "oír e decidir todas as controversias" - é dicir, o poder xudicial (Hobbes 114). Finalmente, dado que todo o propósito do soberano é forzar aos súbditos a absterse de prexudicarse mutuamente, non pode haber dúbida de que o poder executivo é tamén a súa prerrogativa exclusiva. A separación de poderes como concepto é allea a Hobbes debido ás súas opinións sobre o estado da natureza. Crear unha entidade política na que as ramas executiva, lexislativa e xudicial se verifiquen mutuamente, é dicir, compitan, significaría recrear o estado hobbesiano da natureza como guerra a un nivel superior. Desde que o pobo entra nun contrato social e institue un goberno para poñer o estado de natureza detrás deles, non para restablecelo nunha forma diferente, a separación de poderes contraditorias visións de Hobbes directamente.<br/><br/>Locke, por outra banda, abraza a separación do poder como un principio fundacional da súa teoría política. O seu argumento para a separación é evidente na discusión dos límites do poder lexislativo. Como dixo Locke, sería difícilmente recomendable "que as mesmas persoas, que teñen o poder de facer leis, teñan tamén nas súas mans o poder de executalas" (76). O filósofo sinala as imperfeccións da natureza humana e o desexo inherente de "agarrar o poder" como unha razón para esta medida de precaución (Locke 76). Do mesmo xeito que no caso de Hobbes, o relato de Locke sobre a separación de poderes provén directamente da súa interpretación do estado da natureza. Se xa hai xustiza no estado de natureza e o pobo pode comprendela, calquera goberno está inevitablemente suxeito á mesma lei natural. Dado que o poder absoluto sobre as persoas viola ambas as limitacións desta lei, é aconsellable separala e distribuíla para que o goberno funcione adecuadamente.<br/><br/>Este artigo demostrou que, aínda que as diferenzas entre os relatos de Hobbes e Locke sobre o estado natural da humanidade son numerosas, en última instancia suman a presenza de ausencia de premisas morais. Hobbes ve o estado natural como o da liberdade ilimitada, onde as persoas dotadas de capacidades iguais e non ligadas por ningunha noción moral, como a xustiza, compiten incesantemente polos recursos. Locke, porén, interpreta a igualdade e a liberdade eticamente en lugar de practicamente e opina que a guerra é unha perversión do estado natural, xa que a lei natural obriga aos humanos a non danarse mutuamente. Hobbes insiste nun gobernante todopoderoso, xa que, en ausencia de restricións éticas, ningunha outra autoridade podería forzar aos humanos a absterse de danarse mutuamente. Con todo, na opinión de Locke, conceder ao goberno poderes ilimitados sería contradictorio coas limitacións éticas incorporadas na lei da natureza, razón pola cal el, a diferenza de Hobbes, defende a separación de poderes. |
| Fashion Police: What Game of Thrones threw up<br/><br/>Canadian-French singer Abbas Hasan put blinding effort to outshine all of humanity at Fashion Parade 2014. Nothing wrong with that, except safety is priority and the musician is a health hazard here.<br/><br/>We get he wants to be a star. Sadly, he didn't get the memo where they tell the desperate and the infamous that stardom is a metaphor. You don't have to look like one and literally set our sight ablaze. Also, the All Pakistan Aunty Association has officially lodged a complaint against him. The local market has run dry of fake crystals and sequined monstrosities. They have nothing to wear to their biweekly high teas and they claim he is to blame. Apparently, the outfit is inspired by Game of Thrones. Can he please stick to composing sad songs about his neighbour's dead dog instead of conceptualising outfits? Or maybe it's the trauma of losing the dog, whose death he is clearly not over as he is still wearing its carcass.<br/><br/>The charge sheet Outfit<br/><br/>No one can decide where the outfit begins and where Abbas ends. You stare in fascination, sinking into a deep abyss and wonder why he is wearing leather pants. Whose horse did he kill to steal the saddle draped across his shoulders? Was he in prison right before his red carpet appearance and forgot to take off the chains? How will he survive the synthetic leather and post-sequin rash that is bound to be lethal in such high dosage? Why am I still alive?<br/><br/>Idea<br/><br/>His inspiration was seemingly Game of Thrones, but he eventually ended up looking like he was thrown out of a Viking restaurant. Had he come across any of the characters from the show, he would've been slain in the first five seconds of the first episode.<br/><br/>The mental health or lack thereof: Someone get him to a counsellor ASAP! He seems to be under the assumption that wearing a dead dog means that the only friend he had in his life is still alive. Dear Abbas:<br/><br/>1. Denial is not a river in Egypt<br/><br/>2. Your tortured psyche is not helping your music, so get help<br/><br/>3. Try imaginary friends<br/><br/>Bail out!<br/><br/>All of us at the Fashion Police headquarters are severely traumatised. Abbas is someone we did not enjoy arresting. He is currently in custody and attempting revenge by putting on attires from other fantasy shows. He just glitter glued himself in order to look like Edward Cullen from Twilight. As a public service message and to prevent further nervous breakdowns, we gave him the following examples of men from the red carpet of the same event.<br/><br/>Zohaib Hassan<br/><br/>When in doubt, play it safe. The singer looks like your average uncle at a shaadi. A plain black suit with no accessories, even if it's a tad disproportionate, is workable. Zohaib's look is blended into everything and nothing, and when you don't have a fashion sense or the money to hire a stylist, this is okay. It does not carry the risk of cardiac arrest for fellow attendees at an event. Given Abbas' delicate mental condition, this look is what he should aim for. Always and forever.<br/><br/>Ali Zafar<br/><br/>One day, after decades of therapy, Abbas could aspire to wear attire like Ali Zafar's. The dapper summer look is done to near perfection. Ali came really close to looking like a maître d at a French restaurant with his white summer jacket with black lapels, but the shirt saves it, never mind the satin. His pants would have been ridiculous had they not been folded at the ankles. The shoes are what hipster chic happy endings are made of. | Moda policía: o que xogo de tronos vomitou<br/><br/>O cantante canadense-francés Abbas Hasan fixo un esforzo cego para superar a toda a humanidade no Fashion Parade 2014. Nada malo con iso, excepto que a seguridade é unha prioridade e o músico é un perigo para a saúde aquí.<br/><br/>Entendemos que quere ser unha estrela. Por desgraza, non recibiu o memorando onde din aos desesperados e aos infames que o estrelato é unha metáfora. Non tes que parecer un e literalmente queimar a nosa vista. Ademais, a Asociación de tías de todo o Paquistán presentou oficialmente unha queixa contra el. O mercado local está seco de cristais falsos e monstruosidades de lentellas. Non teñen nada que vestir para os seus tés altos quincenais e afirman que é o culpable. Aparentemente, o outfit está inspirado en Game of Thrones. Pode por favor seguir escribindo cancións tristes sobre o can morto do seu veciño en vez de conceptualizar outfits? Ou quizais sexa o trauma de perder o can, cuxa morte claramente non está rematada xa que aínda leva o seu cadáver.<br/><br/>Vestimenta de carga<br/><br/>Ninguén pode decidir onde comeza o atuendo e onde termina Abbas. Miras fascinado, afundíndote nun profundo abismo e pregúntate por que está usando pantalóns de coiro. A quen cabalo matou para roubar a sela cuberta polos seus ombros? Estaba en prisión xusto antes da súa aparencia de alfombra vermella e esqueceu quitar as cadeas? Como sobrevivirá ao coiro sintético e á erupción post-lente que está destinado a ser letal en tan altas doses? Por que aínda estou vivo?<br/><br/>Idea<br/><br/>A súa inspiración foi Game of Thrones, pero finalmente acabou parecendo que foi botado dun restaurante viquingo. Se se atopase con algún dos personaxes da serie, morrería nos primeiros cinco segundos do primeiro episodio.<br/><br/>A saúde mental ou a falta dela: alguén o leva a un conselleiro o máis rápido posible! Parece estar baixo a suposición de que levar un can morto significa que o único amigo que tivo na súa vida aínda está vivo. Querido Abbas:<br/><br/>1. A negación non é un río en Exipto<br/><br/>2. A túa psique torturada non está axudando á túa música, así que obtén axuda<br/><br/>Proba amigos imaxinarios<br/><br/>Salvemos!<br/><br/>Todos nós na sede da Policía de Moda estamos gravemente traumatizados. Abbas é alguén que non nos gustou deter. Actualmente está detido e intenta vingarse poñendo traxes doutros espectáculos de fantasía. Como unha mensaxe de servizo público e para evitar máis colapsos nerviosos, deulle os seguintes exemplos de homes da alfombra vermella do mesmo evento.<br/><br/>Zohaib Hassan<br/><br/>Cando teñas dúbidas, faino seguro. O cantante parece o teu tío medio nun shaadi. Un traxe negro sinxelo sen accesorios, aínda que sexa un pouco desproporcionado, é factible. O aspecto de Zohaib está mesturado con todo e nada, e cando non tes un sentido da moda ou o diñeiro para contratar un estilista, isto está ben. Non conleva o risco de paro cardíaco para os compañeiros asistentes a un evento. Dada a delicada condición mental de Abbas, esta mirada é a que debería aspirar, sempre e para sempre.<br/><br/>Ali Zafar<br/><br/>Un día, despois de décadas de terapia, Abbas podería aspirar a usar roupa como a de Ali Zafar. Ali chegou moi preto de parecer un maître d nun restaurante francés coa súa chaqueta branca de verán con solapas negras, pero a camisa agárdao, non importa o cetim. Os seus pantalóns serían ridículos se non fosen dobrados nos nocellos. Os zapatos son o que hipster chic finais felices están feitos. |
| Determining soil hydraulic properties with different wetting liquids : A thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the Degree of Master of Science at Lincoln University<br/><br/>Abstract<br/><br/>Soil hydraulic properties such as hydraulic conductivity, water retention and plant water relationships dominate the water movement processes. For example, the infiltration, evaporation and water flow within the soil. As a widespread phenomenon in soil, soil water repellency alters the soil hydraulic functions by resisting the water flow into the soils. Moreover, the hydraulic properties not only depend on the pore system of soil but also are affected by the physicochemical properties of the pore surfaces. Compared to water, ethanol is not affected by the water repellency due to its lower surface tension. The purpose of using ethanol is to eliminate the effect of soil water repellency on hydraulic properties measurements. However, applying pure ethanol into natural soil can degrade the soil organic materials and lead to changes in physical properties. Therefore, the aqueous ethanol solutions can be an alternative option. Nevertheless, the feasibility of using aqueous ethanol for determining soil liquid retention curve remains unknown. This study aims to test the feasibility of the aqueous ethanol solutions (0, 10 %, 20 %, 30 %, 40 %, 50 % and 100 % v/v) for establishing liquid retention curve under a small range of applied pressure in coarse sand samples with different wettability and organic amended natural soil (Templeton silt loam (TSL) with mushroom compost, biochar, dairy effluent, and municipal compost, the application rate was 15 % by weight). The result showed that the desorption of testing aqueous ethanol solutions compared to water was quicker by approximately 1 to 3x based on the liquid content at the same applied pressure and the time for reaching each equilibrium. The outcomes from the sand experiment suggested that when the concentration of aqueous ethanol solution was below 50 %, the losses via evaporation were less than 1% and the relative differences between testing liquid and water was lower than 10 %. However, the evaporation losses were 11.06 % and 24.6 %, and the relative differences were all around 15 % and 30 % in 50 % and 100 % ethanol solution, respectively. In contrast, the organic amendments in Templeton silt loam not only increased the water retention capability but also reduced the evaporation losses. The evaporation losses in TSL soil and TSL with organic amendments soil were with 1 % in solutions with less than 50 % ethanol content. Evaporation losses of 50 % and 100 % ethanol were 2.8 % and 2.9 %, respectively. The relative differences between water and testing liquid were similar to the sand experiment when the testing liquid concentrations were below 50 %. However, the relative differences in 50 % and 100 % ethanol solution were smaller than in the sand sample with around 10 % and 15%, respectively. Additionally, the analysis of relative difference suggested that almost all aqueous ethanol solutions had lower volumetric liquid content at the same supplied pressure compared to water, which was a reflection of the aqueous ethanol solutions desorbed faster than water under equivalent pressure. Therefore, 10 % to 40 % of ethanol solutions could be considered an alternative for determining soil hydraulic properties due to their faster desorption rate and not being affected by soil water repellency. Due to the evaporation and dissolution of organic material, aqueous ethanol solutions above 50% concentration were not suitable for coarse sand or medium-textured soil.... [Show full abstract] | Determinación das propiedades hidráulicas do solo con diferentes líquidos humectantes: unha tese presentada en cumprimento parcial dos requisitos para o Mestrado en Ciencias da Universidade de Lincoln.<br/><br/>Abstracto<br/><br/>As propiedades hidráulicas do solo como a condutividade hidráulica, a retención de auga e as relacións de auga das plantas dominan os procesos de movemento da auga. Por exemplo, a infiltración, a evaporación e o fluxo de auga dentro do solo. Como un fenómeno xeneralizado no chan, a repelente á auga do chan altera as funcións hidráulicas do chan ao resistir o fluxo de auga nos chans. Ademais, as propiedades hidráulicas non só dependen do sistema de poros do solo, senón que tamén se ven afectadas polas propiedades físico-químicas das superficies dos poros. O propósito do uso de etanol é eliminar o efecto da repelente á auga do solo nas medicións de propiedades hidráulicas. Porén, a aplicación de etanol puro no solo natural pode degradar os materiais orgánicos do solo e levar a cambios nas propiedades físicas. Por tanto, as solucións acuosas de etanol poden ser unha opción alternativa, pero a viabilidade de usar etanol acuoso para determinar a curva de retención líquida do solo segue sendo descoñecida. Este estudo ten como obxectivo probar a viabilidade das solucións acuosas de etanol (0, 10 %, 20 %, 30 %, 40 %, 50 % e 100 % v/v) para establecer a curva de retención de líquidos baixo un pequeno rango de presión aplicada en mostras de area grosa con humidade diferente e solo natural modificado orgánico (Templeton silt loam (TSL) con compost de cogomelos, biochar, efluente de leite. O resultado demostrou que a desorción das solucións acuosas de etanol en comparación coa auga foi máis rápida aproximadamente de 1 a 3 veces en función do contido de líquido á mesma presión aplicada e o tempo para alcanzar cada equilibrio. Os resultados do experimento de area suxeriron que cando a concentración de solución acuosa de etanol estaba por baixo do 50%, as perdas por evaporación eran menos do 1% e as diferenzas relativas entre o líquido de proba e a auga eran menores do 10%. Porén, as perdas por evaporación foron do 11,06 % e do 24,6 %, e as diferenzas relativas foron do 15 % e do 30 % en solucións de 50 % e 100 % de etanol, respectivamente. En contraste, as emendas orgánicas no lodo de Templeton non só aumentaron a capacidade de retención de auga, senón que tamén reduciron as perdas de evaporación. As perdas de evaporación no solo TSL e TSL con emendas orgánicas do solo foron do 1 % en solucións con menos do 50 % de contido de etanol. As perdas de evaporación do 50 % e do 100 % de etanol foron do 2,8 % e do 2,9 %, respectivamente. As diferenzas relativas entre a auga e o líquido de proba foron similares ao experimento de area cando as concentracións de líquido de proba estaban por baixo do 50%. Porén, as diferenzas relativas na solución de 50 % e 100 % de etanol foron menores que na mostra de area con arredor do 10 % e 15 %, respectivamente. Ademais, a análise da diferenza relativa suxeriu que case todas as solucións acuosas de etanol tiñan un menor contido de líquido volumétrico á mesma presión subministrada en comparación coa auga, que era un reflexo das solucións acuosas de etanol desorbidas máis rápido que a auga a presión equivalente. Polo tanto, entre o 10% e o 40% das solucións de etanol podería considerarse unha alternativa para determinar as propiedades hidráulicas do solo debido á súa velocidade de desorción máis rápida e non estar afectada pola repelente á auga do solo. Debido á evaporación e disolución do material orgánico, as solucións acuosas de etanol por encima da concentración do 50% non eran adecuadas para area grosa ou solo de textura media. |
