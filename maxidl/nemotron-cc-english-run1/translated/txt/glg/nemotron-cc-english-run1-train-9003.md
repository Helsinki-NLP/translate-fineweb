| The Masterpiece: a Chain Poetry Challenge<br/><br/>John has been writing poetry since his school days. He was awarded the "Best Poet 2014 and 2021" Hubby Awards.<br/><br/>Madame Monet in a Japanese kimono, 1875<br/><br/>Claude Monet [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>A Brief History of Collaborative, Collective, or Chain Poetry<br/><br/>Collaborative,collective, or chain poetry is an alternative and creative technique for writing poetry by more than one person. The principal aim of this type of poetry is to create poems through the collaboration of various authors/poets, trying to form a unified voice while still maintain their individual voices.<br/><br/>Examples of collaboration abound in Japanese poetry. Though the precise accounts and records of many such events are either lost or missing.<br/><br/>One of the most famous examples of collective poetry writing was the poem collection titled Ralentir Travaux by Surrealist French poets André Breton, Paul Éluard and René Char. These three poets collaborated to write the poems in this collection over just five days in 1930.<br/><br/>During the 1940s, Charles Henri Ford, an American poet, invented what he called the "chain poem", where each poet wrote a line and then sent the poem to another person (to continue) in another part of the world, by post.<br/><br/>In 2007 a collection of American collaborative poetry Saints of Hysteria: A Half-Century of Collaborative American Poetry was edited and published by Denise Duhamel, Maureen Seaton and David Trinidad.<br/><br/>Collaborative poetry writing has been used in schools and colleges to teach students teamwork and to discover ways in which they are connected.(source: Wikipedia)<br/><br/>Study of a Figure Outdoors: Woman with a Parasol, facing left, 1886<br/><br/>Claude Monet [Public domain or Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>The Aim of This Article and How to Approach the Challenge<br/><br/>A few years back I wrote an article called "Poem Without an End" which included a Christmas poem I had written that lent itself to being added to. I was amazed by the response as at that stage I only had a few followers here. People wrote a stanza of poetry each in "comments" on the hub to follow on from the previous commenter's stanza. It worked out very well and at the end I compiled all the contributions into a single poem as part of the hub.<br/><br/>Similar challenges have been issued since, including one by Frank Atanacio called "Spirits Sat as Mourners" that was also very successful. The difference being that in that instance contributors wrote their own hubs for their stanza of poetry and placed a link on Frank's original hub.<br/><br/>For this particular challenge I don't expect everyone to spend valuable time writing separate hubs for one stanza of poetry (unless you really want to). The main problem being that to make it effective you would have to copy the previously written parts of the poem onto your hub and would probably be hit with "duplication" label.<br/><br/>So, that being the case, and also to save having to leave links everywhere, I just ask that anyone who wants to take part just write their stanza here in "comments." Check the last comment before yours that is contributing to the challenge and follow on. If I see more than one following from the same stanza I will use my poetic licence to work them in as I deem best.<br/><br/>At some stage when I feel there has been enough stanzas added I will probably call an end to the challenge and then compile them all together as the completed poem as part of the article (also giving credit to each contributor).<br/><br/>Flowered Riverbank, Argenteuil<br/><br/>Claude Monet [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>The Challenge!<br/><br/>Now comes the interesting part. If you join this chain poetry challenge you have to try to keep the style and voice of the poem as close as possible to the preceding verses, so that to uninformed readers it will appear that only one author has written the entire poem.<br/><br/>Sounds easy, you say? Well maybe it would be if the poem had a traditional style, rhyme or meter. But this one doesn't! The poem you will be adding to was started by an acquaintance of mine Andriealphus as a "chain poem challenge" elsewhere. At the time of writing I was the only other person who had accepted the challenge, and because I loved the subject I thought it would be a great challenge for my fellow writers and decided to use it here and see if the response would be better. (I know of a few poets here whose writing would suit this style)<br/><br/>Rules :<br/><br/>Follow on from the previous stanza in comments<br/><br/>Try to retain the voice and style of the poem<br/><br/>Keep your stanza/verse to approximately the same length as those before<br/><br/>Claude Monet was one of the most famous painters in the history of art and a leading figure in the Impressionist movement.<br/><br/>In 1883 Monet moved to Giverny. Here, he loved to paint outdoors in the gardens that he helped create. The water lilies found in the pond had a particular appeal, and he painted several series of them throughout the rest of his life; the Japanese-style bridge over the pond became the subject of several works, as well.<br/><br/>In 1912 Monet painted a series of 12 waterlily paintings commissioned by the Orangerie des Tuileries, a museum in Paris. He chose to make them on a very large scale, and to serve as a "haven of peaceful meditation." This project consumed much of Monet's later years. Monet once stated, "These landscapes of water and reflection have become an obsession for me. It is beyond my strength as an old man, and yet I want to render what I feel."<br/><br/>His health was now an obstacle, as well. Nearly blind, with both of his eyes seriously affected by cataracts, Monet finally agreed to undergo surgery for the ailment in 1923.<br/><br/>Monet's famous water lilies turned redder as his cataracts progressed. After getting corrective surgery he destroyed most of the "red lily" paintings, angry that no one really mentioned it to him. Ironically, these paintings were probably what made his impressionistic style so famous in that time -- artists started taking more risks with color and such during this point. (source: biography.com)<br/><br/>The Masterpiece<br/><br/>"The boy sitting behind you says you look like a masterpiece.<br/><br/>Ask him, has he ever seen a Monet up close?<br/><br/>Close enough to see nothing but muddled strokes of weedy lakeshore?<br/><br/>Close enough to dip his fingers into the ridges<br/><br/>where oil paints hardened under an artist's gaze?<br/><br/>Close enough to breathe onto the blood lilies?<br/><br/>Ask him, why did he paint them red?" (Andriealphus)<br/><br/>He grinned like Carroll's cheshire cat.<br/><br/>"Through clouded and bloodshot eyes I imagine.<br/><br/>Be my waterlilies!" he says,<br/><br/>"Feel my breath and let my fingers delve,<br/><br/>become my masterpiece instead.<br/><br/>A brush has never touched a canvas as fine as your fair skin.<br/><br/>Let the masters weep in jealousy,<br/><br/>and Van Gogh slice his ear in envy at the beauty of your nakedness."(Jodah)<br/><br/>Self portrait with bandaged ear<br/><br/>Vincent van Gogh [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>Responses<br/><br/>Now it's your turn. Please write your response in the comments below, remembering to check those immediately before yours for the last written stanza of the poem. If you do decide to write a separate hub for your stanza of verse, make sure you leave a link here in comments.<br/><br/>The Finished Masterpiece<br/><br/>All contributions have been received and I have put the finished poem together with only some slight edits. I hope everyone is happy with the result.

And the beauty we can still enjoy today from all his work.<br/><br/>This is a great challenge! I am really looking forward to adding to this.<br/><br/>I first wanted to stop in and let you know that, up for sure. Shared too.<br/><br/>And thank you so much for all the challenges to help the rest of us, keep our mental energy flowing and giving it a work out! You are the best.<br/><br/>The information about LuLu and the free ISBN number is an answered prayer! So, smile my friend. You are a gift!<br/><br/>Hugs. :-)<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 12, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi again Marj. I think I may have all the verses that are going to come. I have been doing my best to arrange them as I think best with just a little editing. I will probably post the finished poem as a separate hub with a link on this one to it. My book is available on Lulu and iBooks...there's a link on one of the earlier comments. I'd really appreciate it if you were to purhase a copy. Bear in mind it's my first eBook so the formatting etc isn't perfect, but it's taken me seven revisions I think to get it where it is. It will all be easier next time. If you need help let me know.<br/><br/>travmaj from australia on August 12, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi John, you have certainly had some excellent responses to your challenge - I'm sure you'll fuse it altogether beautifully although I imagine a difficult task. I'm interested in your poetry books also - I really have to get my act together technologically - I'll try and check it all out...cheers -<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi Jo, both books 'On the Wings of Eagles" and "I Laughed a Smile" have mostly the same content...except the former has one extra poem. Originally they were in different formats, one ePub, the other PDF but now they are both ePub. They are available through Lulu and iBooks, soon Barnes and Noble and Nook (not Amazon). I may try publishing another book through Amazon soon just to see how it compares. Thanks again.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>John, thanks a lot, the info on publishing with Lulu will be quite useful as I'm thinking of publishing but I'm currently torn between Amazon and Lulu. I wanted to purchase one of your books, but I couldn't seem to find them on Amazon. However, I'll probably get it from Lulu. Wishing you every success, you deserve it.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Hey Phyllis, thanks for ontributing. I like it, a perfect ending to the poem I think.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks Faith.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi Jo, I think I have sorted out the poem satisfactorily. Just waiting to see if there is any more to add. Publishing with Lulu wasn't bad and now that I've done it once it will be easier next time. Getting the formatting to look right in the eBook was the hardest, though you and just type it in a word document and Lulu automatically produces the contents page and converts the document to ePub or PDF you can only use certain fonts and have to make sure the chapter names or poem titles are in Heading 1. They also provide a free ISBN number if you want. Overall it was easier than expected however.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Phyllis, this is succinct and beautiful, I love it. Shyron's did an excellent job also, I thought I'd already commented on her verse, but I hadn't.<br/><br/>Phyllis Doyle Burns from High desert of Nevada. on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Wonderful hub, great idea, Jodah. Here is one from me. Short but sweet. Hope it is okay:<br/><br/>And this the beauty be<br/><br/>From Masters past we see<br/><br/>Impressed upon the boy<br/><br/>Bestowed on her with joy<br/><br/>Faith Reaper from southern USA on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks John and Jo. You are kind. Jo, you have always been a brilliant poet. I, too, am looking forward to the end result after John does his magic to pull it all together.<br/><br/>I will share again to see if there are any more takers.<br/><br/>Blessings<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Faith, beautifully done, I find it incredible how someone with such limited vision can teach us so much about beauty, light and shadows. John, looking forward to reading the end result.<br/><br/>By the way, congtats on publishing your poems. How did you find the process of publishing with Lulu?<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks for your great submission Faith. No it's not too late, I'm still compiling the final poem so it should be up for all to see in a day or two.<br/><br/>Faith Reaper from southern USA on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi John,<br/><br/>I apologize for my late submission here to your wonderful challenge. I am off from work a couple of day and decided to give this a go while my husband is resting from knee surgery. If it does not meet with your standards, please feel free to not use it in your final poem or edit as you deem necessary.<br/><br/>Blessings always<br/><br/>Here it goes:<br/><br/>Confessions to friend Georges Clemenceau<br/><br/>Of light encapsulating both torment, joy<br/><br/>Fervent madness in analyzing colors<br/><br/>Consequential spontaneous creations<br/><br/>Season after season of obsession<br/><br/>Capturing different hues in a single moment<br/><br/>Attentive while strolling in Argenteuill<br/><br/>Brushwork bares masterpiece.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 09, 2015:<br/><br/>Just a shout out to see if anyone else still wants to contribute to this chain poem. I have started compiling the stanzas together but will leave it open for a couple more days in case anyone else is intending to join in. Thanks to all who have contributed.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 02, 2015:<br/><br/>Thank you Genna. It appears Monet is a favourite arist of many here. I hope you'll take part in this challenge too :)<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 02, 2015:<br/><br/>Thank you for a great contribution Shyron. This is a very nice verse. Well done.<br/><br/>Genna East from Massachusetts, USA on August 02, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi John...<br/><br/>I started to read this wonderful challenge (Monet is one of my favorite artists), then came back to finish reading some of the beautiful contributions that give this painting a stunning voice through perception and the senses. What an exciting hub. :-)<br/><br/>Shyron E Shenko from Texas on August 02, 2015:<br/><br/>Following Jo (tobusiness)<br/><br/>"The pure white of the lily's skin<br/><br/>Speaks of no beauty from within<br/><br/>Just Monet's way or goal<br/><br/>For feasting eyes<br/><br/>Not feasting for the soul"<br/><br/>Shyron<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 02, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks for returning Kim, I'm so pleased with the responses.

I'm so glad you like my contribution. This is a very good idea, I know you'll have fun putting it all together. Take care and my best to you.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks Deb, yes I am impressed by the standard of submissions. I'm looking forward to putting it all together.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Yes Ann, it is good to see the poets among us take up the challenge with some great contributions so far. I just hope Imcan do it justice when it comes to putting it together.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Well done Jo. The word "sublime" comes to mind. I hoped all the poets would rise to the fore, and they have. Love it, thanks for contributing.<br/><br/>Deb Hirt from Stillwater, OK on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>I am excited to see what you end up with here. There are a number of fine poets rising to the challenge, so go to it!<br/><br/>Ann Carr from SW England on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Great one, Jo!<br/><br/>You've got everyone going, John! Rather you than me, putting all this together, but it's going to be a humdinger of a poem when it finally comes to an end - if it ever does! You've really started something.<br/><br/>Ann<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Ok, John here goes nothing! Following from Kim's. I hope it reads well.<br/><br/>And the boy began to walk away<br/><br/>But in his wake, I heard him say<br/><br/>"I took a trip to Orangerie<br/><br/>Where the ghost of Monet still abides<br/><br/>I sat right down and gazed awhile<br/><br/>Until I heard a soft voice cry.<br/><br/>"Have you ever seen a fluid dream?<br/><br/>Where light evolves into what it touch<br/><br/>Where serenity flows through cloudy veil<br/><br/>Where the magician's brush like lightening rush<br/><br/>Have you ever seen a sight sublime?<br/><br/>A child born of distorted illusion<br/><br/>This flowering pond that traps the light<br/><br/>That lift the heart and beckons the soul<br/><br/>An abstract pulchritude up close<br/><br/>Move back, behold; such tranquil delight."<br/><br/>I hope this is in line with what the others have done. Feel free to edit if needed. My best...<br/><br/>Jo.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Alrighty!<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Yes Jo, please do. Anyone is welcome to do more than one stanza. I may add another myself at some stage.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>John, I've decided to have a go, but it's about 16 lines, can I do it in two stanzas following on from Kim's wonderful submission? You can always edit it later.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on July 31, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi Jo, sorry to hear you are under the weather at the moment. I am not in a hurry to close this challenge so I'll keep it open until you are back firing on all cylinders and are able to contribute. You are one of the hubbers I was looking forward to getting a response from as I thought it would suit. Thank you for your kind words, and get well soon.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on July 31, 2015:<br/><br/>Wow! John I can't believe I almost missed your incredible challenged. This is something in which I would have loved to participate since Claude Monet is one of my all times favourite artist. Unfortunately, I must cry off. I'm a bit under the weather with a head full of cotton wool, or so it seems. If the challenge is still open when I get rid of this pesky flu I may give it a go, but I must say, the standard is exceptionally high. Maj took it to another level but all the submissions are brilliant. Kudos to you Andriealphus and the other writers who participated so far in this artistic and creative masterpiece.<br/><br/>My best always Jo.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on July 31, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi again Maj, glad this poem inspired you, and yes it beats watching the cricket especially with the Aussie batsmen performing badly in this third test. It will be an interesting exercise for me to fuse all the stanzas together but should be good.<br/><br/>travmaj from australia on July 30, 2015:<br/><br/>John, thank you, I'm most happy you like my offering. I found the poem intriguing and suddenly felt inspired to write my version in the same mode. I'm not sure I wrote a continuation from the stanza before (alwaysexploring) but I'm sure you will fuse it altogether when the time comes. Love all the responses. I haven't managed any creative writing for yonks, can't wait now to start over, just need some time. (beats watching the cricket too!!!) Cheers John, will be checking in -<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on July 30, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks for checking Dana. I am pleased with the quality of responses so far. I just have to wait and see how many more come in. The final,poem should be great.<br/><br/>Dana Tate from LOS ANGELES on July 30, 2015:<br/><br/>Just checking in to see how things are going, I can't wait for the finished product. I attended a poetry class and we did this also it was really fun.<br/><br/>ocfireflies from North Carolina on July 29, 2015:<br/><br/>John,<br/><br/>Thanks so much for providing the platform for without that it is easy to fall down.<br/><br/>; ) Kim<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on July 29, 2015:<br/><br/>Thank you Devika. I haven't seen you around in awhile, I hope all is well.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on July 29, 2015:<br/><br/>Beautiful work Kim. It will follow on perfectly from Maj's as you answered the GIverny question. I am so pleased with the quality of responses so far.<br/><br/>ocfireflies from North Carolina on July 29, 2015:<br/><br/>John,<br/><br/>I had sent this earlier before travmaj's awesome contribution, but maybe it still works (I did a little tweaking)<br/><br/>following as opposed to prior--don't know if<br/><br/>I am making any sense.

Foi galardoado co "Mellor Poeta 2014 e 2021" Premios Hubby.<br/><br/>Madame Monet nun quimono xaponés, 1875<br/><br/>Claude Monet [dominio público], vía Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>Breve historia da poesía colaborativa, colectiva ou en cadea<br/><br/>A poesía colaborativa, colectiva ou en cadea é unha técnica alternativa e creativa para escribir poesía por máis dunha persoa. O principal obxectivo deste tipo de poesía é crear poemas a través da colaboración de varios autores/poetas, tratando de formar unha voz unificada mentres aínda manteñen as súas voces individuais.<br/><br/>Exemplos de colaboración abundan na poesía xaponesa, aínda que os relatos e rexistros precisos de moitos destes eventos están perdidos ou faltan.<br/><br/>Un dos exemplos máis famosos de poesía colectiva foi a colección de poemas titulada Ralentir Travaux dos poetas surrealistas franceses André Breton, Paul Éluard e René Char. Estes tres poetas colaboraron para escribir os poemas desta colección en só cinco días en 1930.<br/><br/>Durante a década de 1940, Charles Henri Ford, un poeta estadounidense, inventou o que chamou o "poema en cadea", onde cada poeta escribiu unha liña e despois enviou o poema a outra persoa (para continuar) noutra parte do mundo, por correo.<br/><br/>En 2007, unha colección de poesía colaborativa estadounidense Saints of Hysteria: A Half-Century of Collaborative American Poetry foi editada e publicada por Denise Duhamel, Maureen Seaton e David Trinidad.<br/><br/>A escritura de poesía colaborativa foi usada nas escolas e colexios para ensinar aos estudantes o traballo en equipo e para descubrir formas nas que están conectados.<br/><br/>Estudo dunha figura ao aire libre: Muller cun parasol, cara á esquerda, 1886<br/><br/>Claude Monet [Dominio público ou dominio público], vía Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>O obxectivo deste artigo e como afrontar o reto<br/><br/>Hai uns anos escribín un artigo chamado "Poema sen fin" que incluía un poema de Nadal que escribira que se prestaba a ser engadido. Quedei sorprendido pola resposta, xa que nese momento só tiña uns poucos seguidores aquí. A xente escribiu unha estrofa de poesía en "comentarios" no centro para seguir a estrofa do comentarista anterior. Funcionou moi ben e ao final compilei todas as contribucións nun só poema como parte do centro.<br/><br/>Desafíos semellantes foron emitidos desde entón, incluíndo un por Frank Atanacio chamado "Espíritos sentados como pranteadores" que tamén foi moi exitoso. A diferenza é que nese caso os colaboradores escribiron os seus propios centros para a súa estrofa de poesía e colocaron un enlace no centro orixinal de Frank.<br/><br/>Para este desafío en particular, non espero que todos pasen un tempo valioso escribindo centros separados para unha estrofa de poesía (a menos que realmente queiras). O principal problema é que para facelo efectivo tería que copiar as partes previamente escritas do poema no seu centro e probablemente sería golpeado coa etiqueta de "duplicación".<br/><br/>Entón, sendo ese o caso, e tamén para aforrar ter que deixar ligazóns en todas partes, só pido que calquera que queira participar só escriba a súa estrofa aquí en "comentarios". Comprobe o último comentario antes do seu que está contribuíndo ao desafío e siga. Se vexo máis dun seguidor da mesma estrofa usarei a miña licenza poética para traballalos como mellor me pareza.<br/><br/>Nalgún momento en que sinto que houbo suficientes estrofas engadidas, probablemente poñerei fin ao desafío e despois compilareinos todos xuntos como o poema completado como parte do artigo (tamén dando crédito a cada colaborador).<br/><br/>Ribeira florida, Argenteuil<br/><br/>Claude Monet [dominio público], vía Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>O reto!<br/><br/>E agora chega a parte interesante. Se te unes a este reto de poesía en cadea, tes que tentar manter o estilo e a voz do poema o máis preto posible dos versos anteriores, de modo que aos lectores desinformados parecerá que só un autor escribiu o poema completo.<br/><br/>Soa sinxelo, dis? Ben, quizais sería se o poema tivese un estilo tradicional, rima ou metro. Pero este non! O poema que vai engadir foi iniciado por un coñecido meu Andriealphus como un "chain poem chain challenge" noutro lugar. No momento de escribir eu era a única outra persoa que aceptara o desafío, e porque eu amaba o tema pensei que sería un gran desafío para os meus compañeiros escritores e decidiu usalo aquí e ver se a resposta sería mellor. (Coñezo algúns poetas aquí cuxa escritura se adaptaría a este estilo)<br/><br/>Regras:<br/><br/>Seguir a estrofa anterior nos comentarios<br/><br/>Intenta manter a voz e o estilo do poema.<br/><br/>Mantén a estrofa/verso aproximadamente da mesma lonxitude que os anteriores.<br/><br/>Claude Monet foi un dos pintores máis famosos da historia da arte e unha figura destacada do movemento impresionista.<br/><br/>En 1883 Monet mudouse a Giverny, onde lle gustaba pintar ao aire libre nos xardíns que axudaba a crear. Os lírios de auga atopados no estanque tiñan un atractivo particular, e pintou varias series deles ao longo do resto da súa vida; a ponte de estilo xaponés sobre o estanque converteuse en obxecto de varias obras, tamén.<br/><br/>En 1912 Monet pintou unha serie de 12 pinturas de lirios de auga encargadas pola Orangerie des Tuileries, un museo en París. Elixiu facelas a gran escala, e para servir como un "refugio de meditación pacífica". Este proxecto consumiu gran parte dos últimos anos de Monet. Monet declarou unha vez: "Estas paisaxes de auga e reflexión convertéronse nunha obsesión para min. Está máis aló das miñas forzas como ancián, e aínda así quero render o que sinto".<br/><br/>Case cego, con ambos os ollos gravemente afectados pola catarata, Monet finalmente aceptou someterse a unha cirurxía para a enfermidade en 1923.<br/><br/>Despois dunha cirurxía correctiva, destruíu a maioría das pinturas de "lirios vermellos", enfadado por que ninguén realmente llo mencionase. Ironicamente, estas pinturas foron probablemente o que fixo que o seu estilo impresionista fose tan famoso nesa época: os artistas comezaron a correr máis riscos coa cor e así durante este punto.<br/><br/>A obra mestra<br/><br/>O neno sentado detrás de ti di que pareces unha obra mestra.<br/><br/>Pregúntalle: ¿Algunha vez viu un Monet de preto?<br/><br/>O suficientemente preto para ver nada máis que trazos confusos de herbas lacustres?<br/><br/>O suficientemente preto para mergullar os dedos nas crestas<br/><br/>onde as pinturas ao óleo endurecidas baixo a mirada dun artista?<br/><br/>O suficientemente preto para respirar sobre os lirios de sangue?<br/><br/>Pregúntalle, por que os pintou de vermello?" (Andriealphus)<br/><br/>Sorriu como o gato de Cheshire de Carroll.<br/><br/>A través de ollos nubrados e sanguentos imaxino.<br/><br/>¡Sede os meus lirios de auga!", dixo.<br/><br/>"Sente o meu alento e deixa que os meus dedos se afunden,<br/><br/>Convertémonos na nosa obra mestra.<br/><br/>Un pincel nunca tocou unha lona tan fina como a túa pel.<br/><br/>Que os amos choren de celos,<br/><br/>e Van Gogh corta o seu oído con envexa da beleza da túa nudez.<br/><br/>Auto-retrato con orella vendada<br/><br/>Vincent van Gogh [dominio público], vía Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>Respostas<br/><br/>Agora é o seu turno.

Vostede é un agasallo!<br/><br/>Abrazos :-)<br/><br/>John Hansen (autor) de Gondwana Land o 12 de agosto de 2015:<br/><br/>Ola de novo Marj. Creo que podo ter todos os versos que van vir. Eu estiven facendo o meu mellor para arranxalos como eu penso mellor con só un pouco de edición. Probablemente vou publicar o poema rematado como un centro separado con unha ligazón sobre este a el. O meu libro está dispoñible en Lulu e iBooks... hai un enlace sobre un dos comentarios anteriores. Agradecería moito se fose a purhase unha copia. Teña en conta que é o meu primeiro eBook polo que o formato etc non é perfecto, pero levoume sete revisións creo que para conseguilo onde está. Todo será máis doado a próxima vez. Se precisas axuda, avísame.<br/><br/>Travmaj de Australia o 12 de agosto de 2015:<br/><br/>Ola John, que certamente tivo algunhas excelentes respostas ao seu desafío - estou seguro de que vai fusionalo completamente fermosamente, aínda que imaxino unha tarefa difícil. Estou interesado nos seus libros de poesía tamén - Eu realmente teño que facer o meu acto xuntos tecnoloxicamente - Vou tentar e comprobar todo fóra ...<br/><br/>John Hansen (autor) de Gondwana Land o 11 de agosto de 2015:<br/><br/>Ola Jo, os dous libros 'On the Wings of Eagles' e "I Laughed a Smile" teñen na súa maioría o mesmo contido... agás que o primeiro ten un poema extra. Orixinalmente estaban en diferentes formatos, un ePub, o outro PDF pero agora ambos son ePub. Están dispoñibles a través de Lulu e iBooks, en breve Barnes and Noble e Nook (non Amazon). Pode que intente publicar outro libro a través de Amazon en breve só para ver como se compara. Grazas de novo.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues de Lincolnshire, Reino Unido o 11 de agosto de 2015:<br/><br/>John, moitas grazas, a información sobre publicar con Lulu será bastante útil xa que estou pensando en publicar pero actualmente estou dividido entre Amazon e Lulu. Quería mercar un dos teus libros, pero non parecía atopalos en Amazon. Con todo, probablemente o conseguirei de Lulu. Desexándoche todo o éxito, merecéchelo.<br/><br/>John Hansen (autor) de Gondwana Land o 11 de agosto de 2015:<br/><br/>Ola Phyllis, grazas por ontributing. Gústame, un final perfecto para o poema creo.<br/><br/>John Hansen (autor) de Gondwana Land o 11 de agosto de 2015:<br/><br/>Grazas Fe.<br/><br/>John Hansen (autor) de Gondwana Land o 11 de agosto de 2015:<br/><br/>Ola Jo, creo que ordenei o poema satisfactoriamente. Só agardando a ver se hai máis que engadir. Publicar con Lulu non estaba mal e agora que o fixen unha vez que será máis fácil a próxima vez. Conseguir que o formato se vexa ben no libro electrónico foi o máis difícil, aínda que vostede e só teclealo nun documento de palabras e Lulu produce automaticamente a páxina de contidos e converte o documento a ePub ou PDF, só pode usar certas fontes e ten que asegurarse de que os nomes dos capítulos ou títulos dos poemas están no título 1. Tamén proporcionan un número ISBN gratuíto se o desexa. En xeral, foi máis doado do esperado.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues de Lincolnshire, Reino Unido o 11 de agosto de 2015:<br/><br/>Phyllis, isto é sucinto e fermoso, encántame. Shyron tamén fixo un excelente traballo, pensei que xa comentara o seu verso, pero non o fixen.<br/><br/>Phyllis Doyle Burns desde o Alto Deserto de Nevada. o 10 de agosto de 2015:<br/><br/>Maravilloso centro, gran idea, Jodah. Aquí está un de min. Curto pero doce. Espero que estea ben:<br/><br/>E esta é a beleza<br/><br/>De mestres pasados vemos<br/><br/>Impresionado polo rapaz<br/><br/>que a agasallaron con alegría<br/><br/>Faith Reaper desde o sur dos Estados Unidos o 10 de agosto de 2015:<br/><br/>Grazas John e Jo. Vostede é amable. Jo, sempre foi un poeta brillante. Eu, tamén, estou desexando o resultado final despois de que John faga a súa maxia para poñelo todo xunto.<br/><br/>Volverei a compartir para ver se hai máis peóns.<br/><br/>Bendicións<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues de Lincolnshire, Reino Unido o 10 de agosto de 2015:<br/><br/>Faith, fermosamente feito, atopo incrible como alguén con visión tan limitada pode ensinarnos tanto sobre a beleza, a luz e as sombras. John, agardando ler o resultado final.<br/><br/>Por certo, congtats sobre a publicación dos teus poemas. Como atopaches o proceso de publicación con Lulu?<br/><br/>John Hansen (autor) de Gondwana Land o 10 de agosto de 2015:<br/><br/>Grazas pola túa gran presentación Faith. Non, non é demasiado tarde, aínda estou compilando o poema final polo que debería ser para todos ver nun día ou dous.<br/><br/>Faith Reaper desde o sur dos Estados Unidos o 10 de agosto de 2015:<br/><br/>Ola John,<br/><br/>Pido desculpas pola miña presentación tardía aquí para o seu marabilloso desafío. Estou fóra do traballo un par de días e decidín darlle unha volta mentres o meu marido está descansando da cirurxía do xeonllo. Se non cumpre cos teus estándares, non o uses no teu poema final nin o edites como consideres necesario.<br/><br/>Bendicións sempre<br/><br/>Aquí vai:<br/><br/>Confesións ao amigo Georges Clemenceau<br/><br/>De luz encapsulando ambos tormento, alegría<br/><br/>Loucura fervente na análise das cores<br/><br/>Creacións espontáneas<br/><br/>Temporada tras temporada de obsesións<br/><br/>Capturando diferentes tonalidades nun só momento<br/><br/>Atentos mentres camiñamos en Argenteuil<br/><br/>Obras maestras de Brushwork Bares.<br/><br/>John Hansen (autor) de Gondwana Land o 9 de agosto de 2015:<br/><br/>Só un berro para ver se alguén aínda quere contribuír a este poema en cadea. Empecei a compilar as estrofas xuntos, pero deixarei aberta por un par de días máis no caso de que alguén máis ten a intención de unirse. Grazas a todos os que contribuíron.<br/><br/>John Hansen (autor) de Gondwana Land o 2 de agosto de 2015:<br/><br/>Grazas Genna. Parece que Monet é un arist favorito de moitos aquí. Espero que participes neste desafío tamén :)<br/><br/>John Hansen (autor) de Gondwana Land o 2 de agosto de 2015:<br/><br/>Grazas por unha gran contribución Shyron. Este é un verso moi agradable. Ben feito.<br/><br/>Genna East de Massachusetts, Estados Unidos o 2 de agosto de 2015:<br/><br/>Ola John...<br/><br/>Comecei a ler este marabilloso reto (Monet é un dos meus artistas favoritos), despois volvín para rematar de ler algunhas das fermosas contribucións que dan a esta pintura unha voz impresionante a través da percepción e os sentidos. Que centro emocionante. :-)<br/><br/>Shyron E Shenko de Texas en agosto 02, 2015:<br/><br/>Seguindo a Jo (traballo)<br/><br/>O branco puro da pel do lírio<br/><br/>Non fala de beleza desde dentro<br/><br/>O camiño ou a meta de Monet<br/><br/>Para os ollos festuosos<br/><br/>Non se festexa para a alma.<br/><br/>Shyron<br/><br/>John Hansen (autor) de Gondwana Land o 2 de agosto de 2015:<br/><br/>Grazas por volver Kim, estou tan satisfeito coas respostas. Só deu para agardar e ver se hai máis.<br/><br/>Ocfireflies de Carolina do Norte o 2 de agosto de 2015:<br/><br/>John,<br/><br/>Tan feliz cada vez que volvo a ver outro elo nesta cadea poética, e Wow, Jo sempre fai xustiza.<br/><br/>Kim<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues de Lincolnshire, Reino Unido o 2 de agosto de 2015:<br/><br/>Ola John, 'sublime' vai facer moi ben. Estou moi contento de que lle gusta a miña contribución. Esta é unha moi boa idea, sei que vai se divertir poñendo todo xunto. Coidado e todo o mellor para ti.<br/><br/>John Hansen (autor) de Gondwana Land o 1 de agosto de 2015:<br/><br/>Grazas Deb, si, estou impresionado co estándar de presentacións. Estou ansioso para poñelo todo xunto.<br/><br/>John Hansen (autor) de Gondwana Land o 1 de agosto de 2015:<br/><br/>Si Ann, é bo ver os poetas entre nós asumir o desafío con algunhas grandes contribucións ata agora. Só espero que Imcan faga xustiza cando se trata de poñelo xuntos.<br/><br/>John Hansen (autor) de Gondwana Land o 1 de agosto de 2015:<br/><br/>Ben feito Jo. A palabra "sublime" vén á mente. Eu esperaba que todos os poetas se levantarían á fronte, e teñen. Encántame, grazas por contribuír.<br/><br/>Deb Hirt de Stillwater, OK en agosto 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Estou emocionado de ver o que acabas con aquí. Hai unha serie de bos poetas que se elevan ao desafío, así que vaia a el!<br/><br/>Ann Carr de SW England en agosto 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Moi ben, Jo!<br/><br/>Tes a todo o mundo indo, John! Máis ben ti que eu, poñendo todo isto xunto, pero vai ser un humdinger dun poema cando finalmente chega a un fin - se algunha vez o fai! Realmente comezou algo.<br/><br/>Ann<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues de Lincolnshire, Reino Unido o 1 de agosto de 2015:<br/><br/>Ok, John aquí non vai nada! Seguindo de Kim. Espero que lea ben.<br/><br/>E o neno empezou a camiñar<br/><br/>Pero no seu espertar, escoiteino dicir<br/><br/>"Fixen unha viaxe a Orangerie"<br/><br/>Onde o fantasma de Monet aínda permanece<br/><br/>Senteime e mirei un pouco<br/><br/>Ata que escoitei un berro suave.<br/><br/>Algunha vez viches un soño fluído?<br/><br/>Onde a luz se transforma no que toca<br/><br/>Onde a serenidade flúe a través do velo nubrado<br/><br/>Onde o cepillo do mago como o acender corre<br/><br/>Algunha vez viches unha vista sublime?<br/><br/>Un neno nacido dunha ilusión distorsionada<br/><br/>Este estanque de flores que atrapa a luz<br/><br/>Que levanta o corazón e chama a alma<br/><br/>Unha pulchritude abstracta de preto<br/><br/>Retrocede, velaquí, tan tranquilo deleite.<br/><br/>Espero que isto estea en liña co que os outros fixeron. Sintase libre de editar se é necesario. O meu mellor...<br/><br/>Jo.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues de Lincolnshire, Reino Unido o 1 de agosto de 2015:<br/><br/>Está ben!<br/><br/>John Hansen (autor) de Gondwana Land o 1 de agosto de 2015:<br/><br/>Si Jo, por favor. Calquera pode facer máis dunha estrofa. Eu mesmo podo engadir outra nalgún momento.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues de Lincolnshire, Reino Unido o 1 de agosto de 2015:<br/><br/>John, decidín ir, pero son unhas 16 liñas, podo facelo en dúas estrofas seguindo a marabillosa presentación de Kim? Sempre podes editalo máis tarde.<br/><br/>John Hansen (autor) de Gondwana Land o 31 de xullo de 2015:<br/><br/>Ola Jo, sinto oír que está baixo o clima neste momento. Non teño présa para pechar este desafío, así que manterei aberto ata que volva a disparar en todos os cilindros e sexa capaz de contribuír. Vostede é un dos alborotos que eu estaba agardando para obter unha resposta de como eu pensaba que sería adecuado. Grazas polas súas palabras amables, e estar ben pronto.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues de Lincolnshire, Reino Unido o 31 de xullo de 2015:<br/><br/>Wow! John Non podo crer que case perdín o teu incrible reto. Isto é algo no que me gustaría participar xa que Claude Monet é un dos meus artistas favoritos de todos os tempos. Desafortunadamente, teño que chorar. Estou un pouco baixo o clima cunha cabeza chea de algodón, ou así o parece. Se o desafío aínda está aberto cando me desfago desta gripe molesta podo darlle un paso, pero debo dicir, o estándar é excepcionalmente alto. Maj levouno a outro nivel pero todas as presentacións son brillantes. Parabéns a ti Andriealphus e aos demais escritores que participaron ata agora nesta obra mestra artística e creativa.<br/><br/>O meu mellor sempre.<br/><br/>John Hansen (autor) de Gondwana Land o 31 de xullo de 2015:<br/><br/>Ola de novo Maj, alégrome de que este poema che inspirou, e si que bate ao ver o cricket, especialmente cos batedores australianos que se desempeñan mal nesta terceira proba. Será un exercicio interesante para min fusionar todas as estrofas, pero debería ser bo.<br/><br/>Travmaj de Australia o 30 de xullo de 2015:<br/><br/>John, grazas, estou máis feliz que che guste a miña oferta. Atopei o poema intrigante e de súpeto sentinme inspirado a escribir a miña versión do mesmo xeito. Non estou seguro de que escribín unha continuación da estrofa antes (sempre explorando), pero estou seguro de que o fusionará completamente cando chegue o momento. Encántanme todas as respostas. Non xestionei ningunha escritura creativa para yonks, non podo agardar agora para comezar de novo, só necesito algún tempo. (batidos vendo o cricket tamén!!!)<br/><br/>John Hansen (autor) de Gondwana Land o 30 de xullo de 2015:<br/><br/>Grazas por comprobar Dana. Estou satisfeito coa calidade das respostas ata agora. Eu só teño que agardar e ver cantos máis entran. O final, poema debe ser grande.<br/><br/>Dana Tate de LOS ANGELES o 30 de xullo de 2015:<br/><br/>Só mirando para ver como van as cousas, non podo esperar polo produto acabado. Asistín a unha clase de poesía e fixemos isto tamén foi moi divertido.<br/><br/>Ocfireflies desde Carolina do Norte o 29 de xullo de 2015:<br/><br/>John,<br/><br/>Moitas grazas por proporcionar a plataforma para sen que sexa fácil de caer.<br/><br/>; ) Kim<br/><br/>John Hansen (autor) de Gondwana Land o 29 de xullo de 2015:<br/><br/>Grazas Devika. Non te vexo por aquí en moito tempo, espero que todo estea ben.<br/><br/>John Hansen (autor) de Gondwana Land o 29 de xullo de 2015:<br/><br/>Belo traballo Kim. Seguirá perfectamente de Maj como respondeu a pregunta GIverny. Estou tan satisfeito coa calidade das respostas ata agora.<br/><br/>Ocfireflies desde Carolina do Norte o 29 de xullo de 2015:<br/><br/>John,<br/><br/>Eu enviara isto antes antes da contribución impresionante de travmaj, pero quizais aínda funciona (eu fixen un pouco de axuste)<br/><br/>en contraposición ao anterior - non sei se<br/><br/>Estou a ter algún sentido. Se non funciona, por favor, non dubide en borrar e tentarei de novo. |

| First of all EEQT itself needs to be further developed in order to provide a theoretical and computational answer to the needs of modern quantum engineering<br/>and technology. We need to include classical systems with infinite<br/>numbers of degrees of freedom - like electromagnetic and/or gravitational<br/>field. We also need to include infinite quantum systems so as<br/>to understand and simulate Bose gas and its phase transitions. But, there<br/>are also steps that must be taken far beyond the paradigm of EEQT.<br/>As we have emphasized so many times: quantum theory has yet<br/>to be understood in terms of a "non-linear classical theory." But what we mean by a "classical theory" is something much more advanced and more<br/>general than clasical mechanics or classical field theory. By a "classical theory" we mean first of all, a theory that is not based<br/>on probabilities from the start; a theory in which probabilities appear at a<br/>later stage, derived from the theory; derived perhaps, in a necessary way. Such a theory must not only specify the mathematical objects and their relations but also make "predictions".<br/>A classical theory is, in particular, a theory in which discrete events can happen, events that are "objective." They may be events that affect mainly the physical stratum, but they may be also "mental<br/>events," changes of states of "consciousness;" whatever they are, even if they<br/>are concerned with branchings of universes, - they DO HAPPEN.<br/>Such a theory, encompassing the quantum theory as we know it today,<br/>does not yet exist, but we can envisage its possible shape. Nothing serves better than an example, so let us give here an example of how<br/>such a theory can be construed.<br/>Imagine a theory developed a'la Einstein's unified field theory, but<br/>with variable metric signature, possibly with a complex causal web, multiple<br/>Einstein-Rosen [40] (see also [41]) bridges,<br/>time loops, nondifferrentiability, fractal structure, all of that additionally complicated by variable dimensionality of space and of "time" (cf [42]. Imagine such a theory to be able to accomodate all the four fundamental<br/>forces known to us, but it also involves an extra field, which is different<br/>from physical fields, and which is non-local in the sense that it does not<br/>survive taking a macro-average-limit when causal space-time<br/>structure of Einstein's general relativity is recovered. This extra field<br/>would be a place for "thought forms" and our theory would couple these<br/>thought forms to more "physical" levels of reality. The very concept of<br/>"time" would arise only in one particular limiting structure. Nothing<br/>prevents a theory of such a type to have mathematical structures rich enough to accomodate consciousness and mind. Due to its complexity,<br/>density of time-loops, bubble-like causal structure, making predictions<br/>in such theory is possible only by applying probability -<br/>as it is the case with systems evolving according to deterministic<br/>but chaotic dynamics. Quantum wave function would emerge in such a<br/>theory as an effective way of predicting. That type of explanation<br/>of quantum indeterminism was postulated long ago by I. J. Good. In<br/>[3] he speculated that<br/>quantum indeterminism can be understood if we admit that individual quantum events that actually happen here and now have future<br/>advanced causes as well has past retarded causes.<br/>A glimpse of such a thought<br/>may have occured to Alan Turing when he wrote his famous, already quoted sentence: "prediction must be linear, description must be nonlinear."<br/>A theory going partially in this direction is being developed by L. Nottale<br/>[43] who states the observation, attributed to Feynman, that "the typical paths of quantum mechanical particles are continuous non-differentiable." Then he continues his development of fractal<br/>space-time ideas to conclude with: "The quantum behavior becomes, in this theory,<br/>a manifestation of the fractal geometry of space-time, in the same way gravitation is, in Einstein's theory of general (motion-)relativity, a manifestation of the curvature of space-time.<br/>Another step in this direction comes from the work of Russian scientists - which started with the most original ideas of N.A. Kozyrev [44]<br/>and A. Sakharov [45], and is being developed in Moscow, the Urals and Siberia, see e.g. [46, 47, 48]. | En primeiro lugar, a propia EEQT necesita ser desenvolvida para proporcionar unha resposta teórica e computacional ás necesidades da enxeñaría e tecnoloxía cuántica modernas. Necesitamos incluír sistemas clásicos con números infinitos de graos de liberdade, como o campo electromagnético e/ou gravitacional. Tamén necesitamos incluír sistemas cuánticos infinitos para comprender e simular o gas de Bose e as súas transicións de fase. Pero tamén hai pasos que deben tomarse moito máis aló do paradigma da EEQT.<br/>Como enfatizamos tantas veces: a teoría cuántica aínda non se entende en termos dunha "teoría clásica non lineal". Pero o que entendemos por "teoría clásica" é algo moito máis avanzado e máis xeral que a mecánica clásica ou a teoría de campos clásica. Por "teoría clásica" entendemos, en primeiro lugar, unha teoría que non se basea en probabilidades desde o principio; unha teoría na que as probabilidades aparecen nunha etapa posterior, derivadas da teoría; derivadas quizais, dun xeito necesario. Tal teoría non só debe especificar os obxectos matemáticos e as súas relacións, senón tamén facer "predicións".<br/>Unha teoría clásica é, en particular, unha teoría na que poden ocorrer eventos discretos, eventos que son "obxectivos". Poden ser eventos que afectan principalmente ao estrato físico, pero tamén poden ser "eventos mentais", cambios de estados de "conciencia"; sexan o que sexan, aínda que estean preocupados polas ramificacións dos universos.<br/>Tal teoría, que abrangue a teoría cuántica tal como a coñecemos hoxe, aínda non existe, pero podemos imaxinar a súa posible forma. Nada serve mellor que un exemplo, así que poñamos aquí un exemplo de como se pode interpretar tal teoría.<br/>Imaxina unha teoría que desenvolveu a teoría de campo unificado de Einstein, pero con sinatura métrica variable, posiblemente cunha complexa rede causal, múltiple.<br/>Einstein-Rosen [40] (ver tamén [41]) pontes, bucles de tempo, non diferenciabilidade, estrutura fractal, todo iso adicionalmente complicado pola dimensionalidade variable do espazo e do "tempo" (cf. [42]). Imaxina que tal teoría é capaz de acomodar as catro forzas fundamentais que coñecemos, pero tamén implica un campo extra, que é diferente dos campos físicos, e que non é local no sentido de que non sobrevive tomando un límite de macro-media cando se recupera a estrutura causal espazo-tempo da relatividade xeral de Einstein. Este campo extra sería un lugar para "formas de pensamento" e a nosa teoría uniría estas formas de pensamento a niveis máis "físicos" da realidade.<br/>O "tempo" só xurdiría nunha estrutura limitante en particular. Nada impide que unha teoría deste tipo teña estruturas matemáticas ricas o suficiente para acomodar a conciencia e a mente. Debido á súa complexidade, densidade de bucles de tempo, estrutura causal semellante a burbullas, facer predicións en tal teoría só é posible aplicando a probabilidade.<br/>como é o caso dos sistemas que evolucionan segundo dinámicas deterministas pero caóticas. A función de ondas cuánticas emerxería en tal teoría como unha forma efectiva de predicir. Ese tipo de explicación do indeterminismo cuántico foi postulada hai moito tempo por I. J. Good.<br/>[3] especulou que o indeterminismo cuántico pode ser entendido se admitimos que os eventos cuánticos individuais que realmente ocorren aquí e agora teñen futuras causas avanzadas tamén teñen causas retardadas no pasado.<br/>Unha ollada a tal pensamento pode ter ocorreu a Alan Turing cando escribiu a súa famosa frase, xa citada: "a predición debe ser lineal, a descrición debe ser non lineal".<br/>Unha teoría que vai parcialmente nesta dirección está a ser desenvolvida por L. Nottale.<br/>[43] que afirma a observación, atribuída a Feynman, de que "os camiños típicos das partículas da mecánica cuántica son continuos non diferenciables". O comportamento cuántico convértese, nesta teoría, nunha manifestación da xeometría fractal do espazo-tempo, do mesmo xeito que a gravitación é, na teoría de Einstein da relatividade xeral, unha manifestación da curvatura do espazo-tempo.<br/>Outro paso nesta dirección vén do traballo dos científicos rusos, que comezou coas ideas máis orixinais de N. A. Kozyrev.<br/>e A. Sakharov [45], e está a desenvolverse en Moscova, os Urais e Siberia, véxase por exemplo [46, 47, 48]. |
| Best Nutrition And Exercise For Lose Weight<br/><br/>How is breakfast really healthy?<br/><br/>In the morning like an emperor, at noon like a king, in the evening like a beggar – goes a well-known proverb. A study by the medical organization Endocrine Society confirms the key message behind the saying: It shows that breakfast plays a more important role than is often assumed. In the morning, the human body actually has more than twice as high a metabolic activity as at other times of the day: A large breakfast not only keeps you full for a long time, blood sugar and insulin levels also rise slowly. The appetite for sweets is regulated, we eat snacks less often during the day. Therefore, breakfast should not be skipped even during a diet.<br/><br/>Of course, having a big breakfast doesn't mean that we should have several croissants with nut nougat cream and sweet breakfast pancakes in the morning. Breakfast is healthy best when it is high in protein and fiber, as well as providing vitamins and minerals. Whole grain bread or muesli, oat flakes, fruits and nuts are energy suppliers that are good for you and keep you full for a long time.<br/><br/>The fact that a large breakfast is better than a large dinner does not necessarily mean that breakfast is essential for losing weight. A meta-analysis carried out in 2019 showed, that the total daily energy intake of people who eat breakfast is on average higher, than that of those who do not have breakfast. The latter were on average just under half a kilo lighter. So, according to the results of this major study, you don't necessarily have to eat breakfast if you want to lose weight.<br/><br/>Lose weight with the right diet – that's how easy it is to put healthy on your plate<br/><br/>Eating healthy in no way means less taste. Fresh vegetables, fish or meat as protein sources and other healthy ingredients conjure up taste in the pot and a smile on your lips – ideally also when you step on the scales. A US study has shown that people who cook their own food and consciously deal with what they eat have a body mass index in the normal range. Restaurant visits or fast food, on the other hand, quickly lure you into the sugar trap: Often there is no indication of how much sugar is in salad dressings, how much fat the potatoes were fried in or whether the meat was not treated.<br/><br/>A healthy lunch consists of three parts – the largest part is fruits or vegetables and should cover half of the plate. A quarter of the meal should consist of protein, i.e. fish, meat or tofu. The remaining quarter consists of carbohydrates and is ideally made from whole grain products. Important: Don't eat at your desk in the office, but stimulate your metabolism and ideally take a short walk before or after lunch.<br/><br/>When should you eat to lose weight?<br/><br/>In the evening, you should focus on light meals that are rather low in carbohydrates. These are the least likely to cause insulin to skyrocket, which is good for our body. Vegetables, dairy products and nuts, for example, are well suited for this.<br/><br/>You should also be careful not to have dinner too late. It is best to have eaten until 7 p.m. – then the body can relax and prepare for the night. Sufficient sleep is important for healthy weight loss. A US study found that people who slept about eight hours a night had better fat deposits. So good night! Allow yourself more than six hours of sleep so that you can start the next day fit and refreshed.<br/><br/>Losing weight without exercise – is it really possible?<br/><br/>It would be so easy, if the dream weight could be achieved simply by lowering the calorie intake. But you probably know the wisdom that diet is only one side of the coin and exercise is the other. So nothing helps: Put on your sportswear and off you go!<br/><br/>Anyone who, in addition to the sports program such as jogging, walking or swimming, also lets the elevator go alone and takes the stairs, takes a little detour or uses the bike instead of the car, is doing wellis also called something good. Even simple walking is good for health. | Mellor nutrición e exercicio para perder peso<br/><br/>Como é o almorzo realmente saudable?<br/><br/>Pola mañá como un emperador, ao mediodía como un rei, á noite como un mendigo, di o famoso proverbio. Un estudo da organización médica Endocrine Society confirma a mensaxe clave detrás do dito: Mostra que o almorzo xoga un papel máis importante do que se adoita asumir. Pola mañá, o corpo humano ten máis do dobre de actividade metabólica que noutras épocas do día: un almorzo grande non só mantén cheo durante moito tempo, os niveis de azucre no sangue e insulina tamén aumentan lentamente. O apetito por doces está regulado, comemos lanches con menos frecuencia durante o día. Polo tanto, o almorzo non debe saltarse mesmo durante unha dieta.<br/><br/>Por suposto, ter un almorzo grande non significa que debamos ter varios croissants con crema de turrón de noz e panquecas de almorzo doces pola mañá. O almorzo é saudable mellor cando é alto en proteínas e fibra, así como proporcionar vitaminas e minerais. Pan de grans enteiros ou muesli, flocos de aveia, froitas e noces son provedores de enerxía que son bos para ti e mantelo cheo durante moito tempo.<br/><br/>O feito de que un almorzo grande sexa mellor que unha cea grande non significa necesariamente que o almorzo sexa esencial para perder peso. Unha meta-análise realizada en 2019 mostrou, que a inxestión total de enerxía diaria das persoas que comen o almorzo é en media maior, que a daqueles que non o fan. Estes últimos eran en media pouco menos de medio quilo máis lixeiro. Entón, de acordo cos resultados deste gran estudo, non necesariamente ten que comer o almorzo se quere perder peso.<br/><br/>Perder peso coa dieta correcta - iso é o fácil de poñer saudable no seu prato<br/><br/>Comer saudable de ningún xeito significa menos sabor. Vexetais frescos, peixe ou carne como fontes de proteínas e outros ingredientes saudables evocan o sabor na olla e un sorriso nos beizos, idealmente tamén cando pisas na escama. Un estudo estadounidense demostrou que as persoas que cociñan os seus propios alimentos e tratan conscientemente co que comen teñen un índice de masa corporal no rango normal. As visitas aos restaurantes ou a comida rápida, por outra banda, atraen rapidamente á trampa do azucre: moitas veces non hai indicación de canto azucre hai nos aderezos para ensalada, canta graxa as patacas foron fritas ou se a carne non foi tratada.<br/><br/>Un xantar saudable consiste en tres partes: a maior parte son froitas ou verduras e debe cubrir a metade do prato. Un cuarto da comida debe consistir en proteína, é dicir, peixe, carne ou tofu. O cuarto restante consiste en carbohidratos e está idealmente feito de produtos de grans enteiros. Importante: Non comer no seu escritorio na oficina, pero estimular o seu metabolismo e idealmente dar un curto paseo antes ou despois do xantar.<br/><br/>Cando comer para perder peso?<br/><br/>Pola noite, debe concentrarse en comidas lixeiras que son bastante baixas en carbohidratos. Estes son os menos propensos a causar que a insulina se dispare, o que é bo para o noso corpo. As leguminosas, os produtos lácteos e as noces, por exemplo, son axeitados para isto.<br/><br/>Tamén debe ter coidado de non cear demasiado tarde. É mellor comer ata as 7 p.m. – entón o corpo pode relaxarse e prepararse para a noite. O sono suficiente é importante para a perda de peso saudable. Un estudo estadounidense descubriu que as persoas que durmían preto de oito horas por noite tiñan mellores depósitos de graxa. Así que boa noite! Permítase máis de seis horas de sono para que poida comezar o día seguinte en forma e refrescado.<br/><br/>Perder peso sen exercicio - é realmente posible?<br/><br/>Sería tan doado, se o peso do soño podería ser alcanzado simplemente reducindo a inxestión de calorías. Pero probablemente saiba a sabedoría de que a dieta é só un lado da moeda e o exercicio é o outro. Así que nada axuda: póñase a roupa deportiva e fóra!<br/><br/>Calquera que, ademais do programa deportivo como correr, camiñar ou nadar, tamén deixa que o ascensor vaia só e toma as escaleiras, toma un pequeno desvío ou usa a bicicleta no canto do coche, está facendo wellis tamén chamado algo bo. Mesmo camiñar é bo para a saúde. |
| Why We Open Sourced the Anvil App Server<br/><br/>Why Open Source?<br/><br/>A little while ago, we open-sourced the Anvil App Server. The community reaction has been great, even a little overwhelming (yes, every reply to that announcement really did land in my inbox!). We've already incorporated a bunch of that feedback into our version 1.2 release. But we keep getting asked, " Why did you open-source such a core part of your product? "<br/><br/>Why do this at all?<br/><br/>Anvil is a tool that makes it as simple as possible to build a web app. We do that by enabling you to build the whole application in one language, Python.<br/><br/>Simple hosting is part of that.<br/><br/>The web platform is broken , and Anvil is our attempt to fix it. And, because there is so much complexity in deploying a web app, a cloud-hosted service was the best way to provide the simplicity we want. That way, you can build your app in the Anvil Editor, and make it live on the Internet with one click.<br/><br/>But we kept hearing from people who said, "that's great, but…"<br/><br/>"…but I need to run this on an offshore platform without reliable internet access"<br/><br/>"…but I want to package my app into an IoT device I sell"<br/><br/>or simply, "…but if I'm putting my eggs in this basket, how can I be sure I can still run my app in ten years' time?"<br/><br/>These are all good points! A cloud service isn't the right solution for everyone. If we want to serve these users, there's got to be some way for them to get their apps out of Anvil and run them locally, under their own complete control.<br/><br/>Open Source: Escape hatch, not an ejector seat<br/><br/>We believe in escape hatches, not ejector seats. At conferences, we sometimes get asked, "can I export this as a Flask+JS app?". Sure, it would be possible – we could generate a server package, compile the client-side Python to Javascript, and spit out a classic web app. But it would have serious drawbacks, because:<br/><br/>Not a comfy ride.<br/><br/>Code generation is an ejector seat. Generated code is better than nothing – at least you can edit it! But the moment you edit that code, you lose all the benefits of the system that generated it. If you're using Anvil because of its drag-and-drop editor and Python in the browser, why should our locally-hosted users have to use vim and Javascript?<br/><br/>So we did it the right way: we open-sourced Anvil's runtime engine. It's the same code that serves your app in our hosted service, and it represents your app the same way. You can edit your code with a text editor, run it, then git push it back into our online IDE. It's not an ejector seat: there's no explosive transition. It's an escape hatch: you can climb out, and climb right back in.<br/><br/>What about our business model?<br/><br/>Anvil was never meant to be one of those enterprise low-code systems that charge you $20/mo for each person who uses your app. Anvil is a developer tool. The apps you develop are yours. Enabling you to run them on a Raspberry Pi is cool, but it doesn't change our business model.<br/><br/>We're doing what we always were: We make and sell a development tool that makes it drastically simpler to build web applications. We provide hosting for Anvil apps. We offer the entire development-and-hosting platform on-site for enterprise customers. And, of course, we offer a free plan so that everyone can use Anvil for hobby or educational purposes – or to start building something and see how it goes.<br/><br/>We've open-sourced the Anvil App Server for the (relatively small) number of people who need it, and to provide the ultimate insurance policy. Sure, you can build an app with vim and host it yourself, without even registering an account with us (we've got docs to show you how!). But the Anvil Editor is the world's easiest way to build a web app, and our hosted service is the easiest way to deploy it – so that's what we expect most of our users to continue doing. And you can build with confidence, knowing that the open-source code is right there if you need it.<br/><br/>Try it yourself<br/><br/>If our development philosophy resonates with you, why not try Anvil yourself? | Por que abrimos o servidor de aplicacións Anvil<br/><br/>Por que Open Source?<br/><br/>Hai un tempo, abrimos o servidor de aplicacións Anvil. A reacción da comunidade foi grande, incluso un pouco abrumadora (si, cada resposta a ese anuncio realmente chegou á miña caixa de entrada!). Xa incorporamos moitos deses comentarios na nosa versión 1.2. Pero seguímonos preguntando, "Por que abriches unha parte tan importante do teu produto?"<br/><br/>Por que facelo?<br/><br/>Anvil é unha ferramenta que fai que sexa o máis sinxelo posible construír unha aplicación web. Facemos iso ao permitirlle construír toda a aplicación nunha linguaxe, Python.<br/><br/>O aloxamento sinxelo é parte disto.<br/><br/>A plataforma web está rota, e Anvil é o noso intento de corrixilo. E, como hai tanta complexidade na implementación dunha aplicación web, un servizo aloxado na nube foi a mellor forma de proporcionar a sinxeleza que desexamos. Deste xeito, pode construír a súa aplicación no Editor de Anvil, e facelo en directo en Internet cun clic.<br/><br/>Pero seguimos escoitando a xente que dicía: "Iso é xenial, pero..."<br/><br/>"...pero necesito executar isto nunha plataforma offshore sen acceso a Internet fiable"<br/><br/>"...pero quero empaquetar a miña aplicación nun dispositivo IoT que vendo"<br/><br/>ou simplemente, "...pero se poño os meus ovos nesta cesta, como podo estar seguro de que aínda podo executar a miña aplicación dentro de dez anos?"<br/><br/>Estes son todos bos puntos! Un servizo na nube non é a solución axeitada para todos. Se queremos servir a estes usuarios, ten que haber algunha maneira de que saquen as súas aplicacións de Anvil e executeno localmente, baixo o seu propio control completo.<br/><br/>Fonte aberta: Escape hatch, non un asento expulsor<br/><br/>Cremos en escotillas de escape, non en asentos expulsores. Nas conferencias, ás veces nos preguntan: "Podo exportar isto como unha aplicación Flask+JS?". Claro, sería posible - poderíamos xerar un paquete de servidor, compilar o lado cliente de Python para Javascript, e cuspir unha aplicación web clásica. Pero tería serios inconvenientes, porque:<br/><br/>Non é un paseo cómodo.<br/><br/>A xeración de código é un asento expulsor. O código xerado é mellor que nada – polo menos podes editalo! Pero no momento en que editas ese código, perdes todas as vantaxes do sistema que o xerou. Se está a usar Anvil debido ao seu editor de arrastrar e soltar e Python no navegador, por que deberían os nosos usuarios aloxados localmente ter que usar vim e Javascript?<br/><br/>Así que o fixemos do xeito correcto: abrimos o motor de tempo de execución de Anvil. É o mesmo código que serve a túa aplicación no noso servizo aloxado, e representa a túa aplicación do mesmo xeito. Pode editar o seu código cun editor de texto, executalo e logo empurralo de volta ao noso IDE en liña. Non é un asento de expulsión: non hai transición explosiva. É unha escotilla de escape: pode saír e volver a entrar.<br/><br/>E o noso modelo de negocio?<br/><br/>Anvil nunca foi pensado para ser un deses sistemas empresariais de baixo código que che cobran $ 20/mo por cada persoa que usa a túa aplicación. Anvil é unha ferramenta de desenvolvemento. As aplicacións que desenvolves son túas. Permitirlle executalos nunha Raspberry Pi é xenial, pero non cambia o noso modelo de negocio.<br/><br/>Estamos facendo o que sempre fomos: Facemos e vendemos unha ferramenta de desenvolvemento que fai que sexa drasticamente máis sinxelo construír aplicacións web. Ofrecemos hospedaxe para aplicacións Anvil. Ofrecemos toda a plataforma de desenvolvemento e hospedaxe in situ para clientes empresariais. E, por suposto, ofrecemos un plan gratuíto para que todos poidan usar Anvil para hobby ou propósitos educativos - ou para comezar a construír algo e ver como vai.<br/><br/>Temos de código aberto Anvil App Server para o (relativamente pequeno) número de persoas que o necesitan, e para proporcionar a póliza de seguro final. Claro, podes crear unha aplicación con vim e aloxala ti mesmo, sen sequera rexistrar unha conta connosco (temos documentos para amosarche como!). Pero Anvil Editor é a forma máis sinxela de construír unha aplicación web, e o noso servizo aloxado é a forma máis sinxela de implementala, polo que esperamos que a maioría dos nosos usuarios continúen a facelo. E podes construír con confianza, sabendo que o código aberto está aí se o necesitas.<br/><br/>Proba ti mesmo<br/><br/>Se a nosa filosofía de desenvolvemento resoa contigo, por que non probar Anvil ti mesmo? |
