| Forty-nine years ago today, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act of 1965.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Nearly a century ago, the 15th Amendment to the Constitution stated, "The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of race, color or previous condition of servitude." And nearly a century before that, our nation's founding fathers set in motion the great experiment of American democracy by declaring that "all men are created equal."<br/><br/>The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was a belated acknowledgment that even in America, our foundational ideals carry little weight if not protected by the rule of law. That's why Section 2 of the 15th Amendment granted Congress the "power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation."<br/><br/>And indeed, the codified language of the Voting Rights Act was able to achieve what the Reconstruction-era Congress and Thomas Jefferson could not. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act—and the civil rights movement from which they emerged—served as the catalyst for a dramatic increase in the opportunity for black Americans to participate in the democratic process.<br/><br/>For example, only 6.7 percent of eligible black Mississippians were registered to vote as of 1962; by 1969 that figure had reached 66.5 percent. Today, Mississippi has more black elected officials than any other state.<br/><br/>The protections put in place by the Voting Rights Act were long overdue when they were passed, representative of the arduous struggle with which they were achieved. But unthinkably, these protections are now under assault, jeopardizing the progress our nation worked so hard to achieve.<br/><br/>Last year, in the case of Shelby County v. Holder, the U.S. Supreme Court gutted a key component of the Voting Rights Act that enabled prior federal review to ensure nondiscrimination before any new voting law went into effect.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Sadly, the response of Republican leaders has been to do nothing. Sen. Ted Cruz and Gov. Rick Perry went out of their way to praise the Supreme Court's decision. Sen. Rand Paul dismissed the continued necessity of the Voting Rights Act by noting, "We have an African-American president."<br/><br/>While the election of President Barack Obama was indeed a historic milestone, it is dangerous to think that it absolves us from remaining vigilant against the lingering consequences of our nation's past. The haste with which states have moved to enact voting restrictions is confirmation that the protections put in place by Section 4 are still necessary.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Republican governors have signed strict photo-identification restrictions into law as the solution to a virtually nonexistent problem of voter impersonation, disproportionately hurting women, young people, working families and the African-American community. It's disingenuous for Republicans like Paul to seek the votes of these communities when they believe "there's nothing wrong with" putting restrictions in place that make it harder for these constituencies to vote.<br/><br/>Republicans have also sought to restrict early-voting periods, including the Sunday before Election Day, when African-American churches have had great success with Souls to the Polls programs.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>These restrictions represent a callous effort by Republicans to make voting harder, based on narrow, short-term political calculations that Republicans can win elections by shrinking the size of the electorate.<br/><br/>Democrats have a very different mission when it comes to voting: to ensure that every eligible voter can register, that every registered voter can vote and that every vote is accurately counted.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>The Democratic National Committee's Voter Expansion Project reflects our belief that greater voter participation strengthens our nation and our democracy. We'll continue to use our unmatched institutional knowledge to protect voting rights against legislation and tactics that would attempt to suppress the vote. And because the best defense is a good offense, we're also working to expand the vote by deploying our technology and data resources to register new voters.<br/><br/>On this anniversary, one of the best ways we can honor those who struggled—and in some cases gave their very lives—for the legislation's passage is for Republicans in Congress to join Democrats in passing the Voting Rights Amendment Act to restore the promise of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Democrat, represents Florida's 23rd Congressional District in the United States Congress. Since 2011, she has served as chair of the Democratic National Committee. Follow her on Twitter.<br/><br/>The Root aims to foster and advance conversations about issues relevant to the black Diaspora by presenting a variety of opinions from all perspectives, whether or not those opinions are shared by our editorial staff. | Hai 49 anos, o presidente Lyndon B. Johnson asinou a Lei de Dereitos de Voto de 1965.<br/><br/>Anuncio<br/><br/>Hai case un século, a 15a Emenda á Constitución declaraba: "O dereito dos cidadáns dos Estados Unidos ao voto non será negado ou abreviado polos Estados Unidos ou por ningún estado por razón de raza, cor ou condición previa de servidume". E case un século antes diso, os pais fundadores da nosa nación puxeron en marcha o gran experimento da democracia estadounidense ao declarar que "todos os homes son creados iguais".<br/><br/>A Lei de Dereitos de Voto de 1965 foi un recoñecemento tardío de que mesmo en Estados Unidos, os nosos ideais fundacionais teñen pouco peso se non están protexidos polo estado de dereito. É por iso que a sección 2 da 15a Emenda concedeu ao Congreso o "poder de facer cumprir este artigo por lexislación apropiada".<br/><br/>E, de feito, a linguaxe codificada da Lei de Dereitos de Voto foi capaz de lograr o que o Congreso da era da Reconstrución e Thomas Jefferson non puideron. A Lei de Dereitos Civís de 1964 e a Lei de Dereitos de Voto -e o movemento de dereitos civís do que emerxeron- serviron como catalizador para un aumento dramático na oportunidade para os afroamericanos de participar no proceso democrático.<br/><br/>Por exemplo, só o 6,7 por cento dos Mississippianos negros elixibles estaban rexistrados para votar en 1962; en 1969 esa cifra alcanzara o 66,5%.<br/><br/>As proteccións postas en marcha pola Lei de Dereitos de Voto tardaron moito en ser aprobadas, representativas da ardua loita coa que se lograron. Pero impensablemente, estas proteccións están agora baixo asalto, poñendo en perigo o progreso que a nosa nación traballou tan duro para lograr.<br/><br/>O ano pasado, no caso de Shelby County v. Holder, a Corte Suprema dos Estados Unidos destruíu un compoñente clave da Lei de Dereitos de Voto que permitiu a revisión federal previa para garantir a non discriminación antes de que calquera nova lei de voto entrase en vigor.<br/><br/>Anuncio<br/><br/>Lamentablemente, a resposta dos líderes republicanos foi non facer nada. O senador Ted Cruz e o gobernador Rick Perry fixeron todo o posible para eloxiar a decisión do Tribunal Supremo. O senador Rand Paul descartou a necesidade continuada da Lei de Dereitos de Voto ao sinalar: "Temos un presidente afroamericano".<br/><br/>Aínda que a elección do presidente Barack Obama foi de feito un fito histórico, é perigoso pensar que nos absolve de permanecer vixiantes contra as consecuencias persistentes do pasado da nosa nación. A prisa coa que os estados se moveron para promulgar restricións de voto é a confirmación de que as proteccións postas en marcha pola Sección 4 aínda son necesarias.<br/><br/>Anuncio<br/><br/>Os gobernadores republicanos asinaron restricións estritas de foto-identificación na lei como a solución a un problema practicamente inexistente de suplantación de voto, ferindo desproporcionadamente as mulleres, os mozos, as familias traballadoras e a comunidade afroamericana. É falso que os republicanos como Paul busquen os votos destas comunidades cando cren que "non hai nada de malo en" poñer restricións que fagan máis difícil que estes electorados voten.<br/><br/>Os republicanos tamén buscaron restrinxir os períodos de votación anticipada, incluíndo o domingo antes do día das eleccións, cando as igrexas afroamericanas tiveron un gran éxito con programas de Souls to the Polls.<br/><br/>Anuncio<br/><br/>Estas restricións representan un esforzo insensible dos republicanos para facer máis difícil o voto, baseado en cálculos políticos estreitos e a curto prazo de que os republicanos poden gañar as eleccións reducindo o tamaño do electorado.<br/><br/>Os demócratas teñen unha misión moi diferente cando se trata de votar: garantir que cada votante elixible poida rexistrarse, que cada votante rexistrado poida votar e que cada voto sexa contado con precisión.<br/><br/>Anuncio<br/><br/>O Proxecto de Expansión de Votantes do Comité Nacional Demócrata reflicte a nosa crenza de que unha maior participación de votantes fortalece a nosa nación e a nosa democracia. Seguiremos usando os nosos incomparables coñecementos institucionais para protexer os dereitos de voto contra a lexislación e as tácticas que intentan suprimir o voto.

| Q&A: Vatican safeguarding expert Fr Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>13 June 2021<br/><br/>Fr Hans Zollner SJ. Image: Australian Jesuits.<br/><br/>The President of the Centre for Child Protection at the Gregorian University in Rome, and a member of the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors, Fr Hans Zollner SJ, was in Australia in 2018 to speak to Catholic ministry leaders and survivors.<br/><br/>Michael McVeigh from Jesuit Communications sat down with him during the visit to explore how the Church is responding to the abuse crisis internationally, and what can be learned from our experiences in Australia.<br/><br/>MM: This is your third trip to Australia. You've visited quite a few other countries to see how the Church is responding to abuse around the world. Can you give us some idea of what the global picture looks like?<br/><br/>Fr Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>HZ: My understanding, after having visited about 50 countries on five or six continents, is that the Church is really starting to move over the last couple of years on the issue of doing justice to victims, of listening to them, and doing whatever can be done in terms of safeguarding.<br/><br/>I was with the Jesuit Provincials from all over Africa at the end of April, and the President of the Jesuit Assistancy of Africa and Madagascar is very much committed and dedicated to this. He has put up a thorough action plan for formation and for introducing guidelines all over the place. It's a very considerate and very deliberate effort to do whatever can be done to be proactively engaged as Jesuits in Africa — in a continent where until a few years ago all of this was a foreign language.<br/><br/>One of the challenges of trying to develop this global approach is that you're dealing with so many cultures, and so many different understandings. How do you bring this together and try to provide training and support religious communities tackling these issues?<br/><br/>This is one of the major questions we have. I think what I can do is stimulate discussion, stimulate reflection, and prepare people as much as possible so that they can do the groundwork.<br/><br/>The Centre for Child Protection at the Gregorian University does not pretend to have the response to every question. Not only because we don't know the specific contexts — we might know a few of them, but we're talking about thousands of cultures, we're talking about hundreds of languages, we're talking about very diverse legal backgrounds. It varies even sometimes within one country, such as Australia where you have states within the Commonwealth of Australia that have different laws than other states.<br/><br/>I am somebody who tries to elicit and stimulate discussion and reflection. I'm also very happy to listen to people.<br/><br/>You mentioned the need to listen and support victims in being heard. We've obviously had the Royal Commission here in Australia, but what are some of the other ways that you've seen that the voices of victims are being supported around the world?<br/><br/>In France there is one diocese that has established what they call 'The Listening Space'. There, victims can come forward and they can express themselves. The bishop is present. It's an open space in which people who have been hurt tremendously are free at least to express what they want to ask from the Church leadership etc.<br/><br/>There are other places in the USA or in other countries where victims have been invited by dioceses, by Provinces, by the leadership of the Church, to come forward. I have to say that overall I think there is a good will, and there are more people like bishops and provincials who listen to victims than we know. But there is no one model of giving victims not only the space to express themselves and be listened to, but also to engage actively in Church development.<br/><br/>In terms of setting up spaces for support for victims, what are some of the things you've seen that could really help — and that we could be considering here in Australia?<br/><br/>One of the major points that many victims bring up is, 'Can't we have, within parish settings, within schools settings, a regular conversation going on that includes survivors of abuse as regular members of a committee, a commission, a sounding board, a feedback group or something like that?' So that this voice is not only brought in on a specific occasion, or where a person feels like he or she is at a point to be able to speak out about it, but [is heard] on a regular basis — build that voice into the system.<br/><br/>That will help all of us. It will help survivors and victims because they will feel welcome and appreciated in the specific experience, and in the specific life challenges, that they went through. Secondly it will help the community at large, because we can at least make ourselves more and more sensitive to what the concerns and specific needs of survivors are — that can also talk to the needs of young people.<br/><br/>M: We have strong groups of survivors here in Australia who have been able to support each other through that process. But what you're saying is that we need some way of supporting those groups, and supporting those people, through our own institutions as well?<br/><br/>And I think we need to be creative. It will work for one school and one parish and one diocese in one way, and for others in a different way. Because the survivors with whom I am in constant contact, they have quite similar requests, and similar experiences in regard to being welcomed in the Church or not — feeling thrown out or dismissed. But they have also among themselves quite different expectations. So I have learned that you have also to be very forthcoming in accepting the differences in what this specific group, or this specific survivor, wants, requests and needs.<br/><br/>M: Survivors talk about wanting to have their stories heard and acknowledged. We've had the Royal Commission here in Australia, which provided an independent process where victims could come forward. Is there a need for something like that in terms of a truth, justice and reconciliation process for the Church internationally?<br/><br/>H: Yes, I think there is a need for that internationally. But I think first every local church needs to do its own homework. I don't see it happening very soon that some such council or commission would be established to look into this area for the whole Church. The Church has a membership of 1.3 billion people, and is present in 190 countries, with all kinds of differences in expectations concerning psychological, spiritual and financial support.<br/><br/>There is one thing that I have come across consistently in communicating with, working with and listening to victims, and that is that they want to be listened to. So if there was the feeling that victims were constantly being listened to — in Rome and elsewhere — I think that would give a great relief to many victims.<br/><br/>I think [Pope Francis'] concern, especially with regard to your question, is that the local churches do whatever they can so that victims will be listened to in that particular country. I have a list of people who want to speak to the Holy Father directly, and physically it is impossible. I was there in 2014 to translate for two German survivors who were chosen with two Irish and two English survivors when he received the six of them at home. He took the whole morning listening to them one after the other. For each one, he was there for 40 to 45 minutes. Were he to do this for every survivor he couldn't sleep anymore.<br/><br/>His example is modelling for the whole Catholic Church the way victims and survivors are received, welcomed and listened to. I think if the bishops and the provincials in this world, in all countries, followed his example, many survivors would be really appreciative of that.<br/><br/>Archbishop Diarmud Martin was recently quoted just before the World Meeting of Families, about the Pontifical Commission, saying that it's too small as it's currently set up to achieve what it needs to achieve. What's your take on that? Does the Church need to be putting more resources into how it's overseeing those issues?<br/><br/>At the moment we are 16 members from basically all continents, and the major language groups. We represent a variety of disciplines and professions, and the purpose of the commission — as the statutes that have just been promulgated state — is to provide counsel to the Holy Father.<br/><br/>A common misunderstanding about the commission is first that we deal with cases of allegations. That is not the case. We have no juridical or administrative power in regards to cases, because when it comes to allegations of abuse the tribunals and procedure are set.<br/><br/>A second misunderstanding is that we promote, directly, things on the ground. Our first and foremost goal is that we advise the Holy Father on issues.<br/><br/>So from my point of view, yes, we need to invest more. But we need to invest more on the local level, and we need to make sure that the proposals from the Pontifical Commission are forwarded to the Holy Father — which normally the President does — and then there is a follow-up process that reflects what we have given as our advice.<br/><br/>In Australia, Catholic Professional Standards Limited is overseeing the Church's response and providing guidelines and support for ensuring all the institutions in the Church are child-safe institutions. Is there a need for some kind of organisational support from Rome for those bishops and dioceses that are struggling to form these institutions and provide safeguarding in those dioceses?<br/><br/>I think ultimately the commission will develop in that line. They are now in the process of hiring experts in those areas.<br/><br/>I think the Church needs to understand that the local churches can learn from each other mutually. And my understanding has always been — and I think the Holy Father has reminded us — that the Church will not function as a centralised company. It does not work like that, effectively. Every bishop, every bishops conference, has, to some extent, its life on its own. What we need to learn more is to open channels of mutual communication.<br/><br/>There are a number of things that people blame for abuse in the Church. As a priest and a psychologist, and as someone who has met and worked with survivors, what are your thoughts on that issue?<br/><br/>I think the question of where does abuse come from is the most important one, and the Pope has addressed that in his letter to the people of God published on 20 August. He says in the first paragraph, and repeats it over and over again, that the question of sexual abuse is always linked — or almost always linked — not only to the question of abuse of power, but also to the abuse of conscience.<br/><br/>So the real fundamental question of abuse is much more complex than just [the question of] sexuality — be it heterosexual or homosexual. It's a power issue, and there we have to really work on the question of how do we understand priesthood, how to we understand bishophood, how do we understand and live out our ministries? What are the boundaries?<br/><br/>That's why I'm very happy that the Jesuit Province in Australia is establishing a Code of Conduct. Because we don't talk only about sexual abuse of minors. We talk about sexual abuse of adults, and we talk about abuse in other ways — like abuse of conscience, where you dictate to someone what you think, or you pretend to know by God, and you can tell another person, 'You need to do that', against the conscience of that person.<br/><br/>Many people think celibacy produces abuse. As I always say, celibacy as such is not cause for abusing — otherwise how do we explain that 99.9 per cent of all abusers do not live a celibate life, and how do we explain that 95 or 96 per cent of all priests do not abuse minors? But, celibacy, or a vow of chastity, that is not really integrated, that is not really lived out properly — yes, that produces a problem. Sometimes people take to drinking, sometime they take to gambling, and sometimes they take to sexual misconduct, with adults and with minors.<br/><br/>The real question about this is how do we deal with the notion of religious spiritual power with which priests and bishops are invested? How can theology help us to understand, and maybe how can sociology, psychology, or business administration help us to define the limits of power, and the necessity of keeping your boundaries | Preguntas e respostas: O experto en salvagarda do Vaticano P. Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>13 xuño 2021<br/><br/>Fr Hans Zollner SJ. Image: Australian Jesuits.<br/><br/>O presidente do Centro para a Protección da Infancia da Universidade Gregoriana de Roma, e membro da Pontificia Comisión para a Protección dos Menores, o P. Hans Zollner SJ, estivo en Australia en 2018 para falar cos líderes do ministerio católico e os superviventes.<br/><br/>Michael McVeigh de Comunicacións Xesuítas sentou con el durante a visita para explorar como a Igrexa está respondendo á crise de abuso internacionalmente, e o que se pode aprender das nosas experiencias en Australia.<br/><br/>MM: Esta é a súa terceira viaxe a Australia. Visitou moitos outros países para ver como a Igrexa está respondendo aos abusos en todo o mundo. Pode darnos unha idea de como é a imaxe global?<br/><br/>Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>HZ: O meu entendemento, despois de visitar uns 50 países en cinco ou seis continentes, é que a Igrexa está realmente comezando a moverse nos últimos dous anos sobre o tema de facer xustiza ás vítimas, de escoitalas e de facer o que se poida en termos de salvagarda.<br/><br/>Estiven cos xesuítas provinciais de toda África a finais de abril, e o presidente da Asistencia xesuíta de África e Madagascar está moi comprometido e dedicado a isto. Fixo un plan de acción exhaustivo para a formación e para a introdución de directrices en todo o lugar. É un esforzo moi considerado e moi deliberado facer todo o que se poida facer para participar proactivamente como xesuítas en África, nun continente onde ata hai uns anos todo isto era unha lingua estranxeira.<br/><br/>Un dos retos de tratar de desenvolver este enfoque global é que se está a tratar con tantas culturas e con tantos entendementos diferentes. Como se fai para axudar e axudar ás comunidades relixiosas a resolver estes problemas?<br/><br/>Esta é unha das grandes preguntas que temos. Creo que o que podo facer é estimular a discusión, estimular a reflexión e preparar á xente o máximo posible para que poidan facer o traballo de base.<br/><br/>O Centro de Protección á Infancia da Universidade Gregoriana non pretende ter a resposta a todas as preguntas. Non só porque non coñecemos os contextos específicos --podemos coñecer algúns deles, pero estamos a falar de miles de culturas, estamos a falar de centos de linguas, estamos a falar de antecedentes xurídicos moi diversos. Varia incluso ás veces dentro dun país, como Australia, onde hai estados dentro da Commonwealth de Australia que teñen leis diferentes a outros estados.<br/><br/>Son alguén que intenta suscitar e estimular a discusión e a reflexión. Tamén estou moi contento de escoitar á xente.<br/><br/>Mencionou a necesidade de escoitar e apoiar ás vítimas para que sexan escoitadas. Obviamente temos a Comisión Real aquí en Australia, pero cales son algunhas das outras formas en que viu que as voces das vítimas están a ser apoiadas en todo o mundo?<br/><br/>En Francia hai unha diocese que estableceu o que eles chaman "O Espazo de Escoita". Alí, as vítimas poden adiantarse e expresarse. O bispo está presente. É un espazo aberto no que as persoas que foron feridas tremendamente son libres polo menos para expresar o que queren pedir á dirección da Igrexa etc.<br/><br/>Hai outros lugares nos Estados Unidos ou noutros países onde as vítimas foron convidadas polas dioceses, polas provincias, pola dirección da Igrexa, a presentarse. Teño que dicir que en xeral creo que hai boa vontade, e hai máis xente como bispos e provinciais que escoita ás vítimas do que coñecemos. Pero non hai un único modelo de dar ás vítimas non só o espazo para expresarse e ser escoitadas, senón tamén para participar activamente no desenvolvemento da Igrexa.<br/><br/>En termos de crear espazos de apoio ás vítimas, cales son algunhas das cousas que viches que realmente poderían axudar e que poderíamos estar considerando aquí en Australia?<br/><br/>Un dos principais puntos que moitas vítimas evocan é: "Non podemos ter, dentro dos ámbitos parroquiais, dentro dos ámbitos escolares, unha conversación regular que inclúe a sobreviventes de abusos como membros regulares dun comité, unha comisión, unha mesa de sondaxe, un grupo de retroalimentación ou algo así?" Para que esta voz non só se faga presente nunha ocasión específica, ou cando unha persoa se sinta como que está a un punto de poder falar sobre iso, senón que se escoite regularmente: construír esa voz no sistema.<br/><br/>Iso axudará a todos nós. Axudará aos superviventes e ás vítimas porque se sentirán benvidos e apreciados na experiencia específica, e nos desafíos específicos da vida, que atravesaron. En segundo lugar, axudará á comunidade en xeral, porque polo menos podemos facernos máis e máis sensibles ás preocupacións e necesidades específicas dos superviventes, que tamén poden falar coas necesidades dos mozos.<br/><br/>M: Temos fortes grupos de superviventes aquí en Australia que foron capaces de apoiarse uns a outros a través deste proceso. Pero o que está a dicir é que necesitamos algunha forma de apoiar a eses grupos, e apoiar a eses pobos, a través das nosas propias institucións tamén?<br/><br/>E creo que temos que ser creativos. Funcionará para unha escola e unha parroquia e unha diocese dun xeito, e para outros doutro xeito. Porque os superviventes cos que estou en contacto constante teñen peticións moi semellantes, e experiencias semellantes en canto a ser acollidos na Igrexa ou non, sentindose expulsados ou despedidos. Pero tamén teñen expectativas moi diferentes entre si, así que aprendín que tamén tedes que ser moi dispostos a aceptar as diferenzas no que este grupo específico, ou este sobrevivente específico, quere, pide e necesita.<br/><br/>M: Os sobreviventes falan de querer que as súas historias sexan escoitadas e recoñecidas. Tivemos a Comisión Real aquí en Australia, que proporcionou un proceso independente onde as vítimas podían presentarse. Hai unha necesidade de algo así en termos dun proceso de verdade, xustiza e reconciliación para a Igrexa internacionalmente?<br/><br/>H: Si, creo que hai unha necesidade para iso internacionalmente. Pero creo que primeiro cada igrexa local necesita facer os seus propios deberes. Non vexo que aconteza moi pronto que algún consello ou comisión se estableza para examinar esta área para toda a Igrexa. A Igrexa ten 1.300 millóns de membros e está presente en 190 países, con todo tipo de diferenzas nas expectativas en relación co apoio psicolóxico, espiritual e financeiro.<br/><br/>Hai unha cousa coa que me atopei constantemente ao comunicarme, traballar e escoitar ás vítimas, e é que elas queren ser escoitadas. Entón, se houbese a sensación de que as vítimas eran escoitadas constantemente, en Roma e noutros lugares, creo que daría un gran alivio a moitas vítimas.<br/><br/>Creo que a preocupación, especialmente con respecto á súa pregunta, é que as igrexas locais fagan todo o que poidan para que as vítimas sexan escoitadas nese país en particular. Teño unha lista de persoas que queren falar co Santo Padre directamente, e fisicamente é imposible. En 2014 estiven alí para traducir para dous superviventes alemáns que foron escollidos con dous superviventes irlandeses e dous superviventes ingleses cando recibiu a seis deles na casa. Tomou toda a mañá escoitándoos un tras outro. Para cada un deles, estivo alí durante 40 ou 45 minutos. Se fose para facer isto para cada sobrevivente que xa non podía durmir.<br/><br/>O seu exemplo é modelar para toda a Igrexa católica o xeito en que as vítimas e os superviventes son acollidos, acollidos e escoitados. Penso que se os bispos e os provinciais deste mundo, en todos os países, seguisen o seu exemplo, moitos superviventes estarían realmente agradecidos por iso.<br/><br/>O arcebispo Diarmud Martin foi recentemente citado xusto antes do Encontro Mundial das Familias, sobre a Pontificia Comisión, dicindo que é demasiado pequeno, xa que está configurado actualmente para lograr o que necesita lograr. Cal é a súa opinión sobre iso? É necesario que a Igrexa poña máis recursos para supervisar estes asuntos?<br/><br/>Actualmente somos 16 membros de basicamente todos os continentes, e os principais grupos lingüísticos. Representamos unha variedade de disciplinas e profesións, e o propósito da comisión -como os estatutos que acaban de ser promulgados- é proporcionar consello ao Santo Padre.<br/><br/>Un malentendido común sobre a comisión é, en primeiro lugar, que tratamos casos de alegacións. Non temos poder xurídico ou administrativo en relación cos casos, porque cando se trata de denuncias de abusos os tribunais e procedementos están establecidos.<br/><br/>Un segundo malentendido é que promovemos, directamente, as cousas no terreo. O noso primeiro e principal obxectivo é que asesoremos ao Santo Padre sobre cuestións.<br/><br/>Polo tanto, si, temos que investir máis. Pero temos que investir máis a nivel local, e temos que asegurarnos de que as propostas da Pontificia Comisión sexan enviadas ao Santo Padre -que normalmente fai o Presidente- e logo hai un proceso de seguimento que reflicte o que demos como o noso consello.<br/><br/>En Australia, Catholic Professional Standards Limited está supervisando a resposta da Igrexa e proporcionando directrices e apoio para garantir que todas as institucións da Igrexa sexan institucións seguras para os nenos. Hai necesidade de algún tipo de apoio organizativo de Roma para aqueles bispos e dioceses que están loitando por formar estas institucións e proporcionar salvagarda naquelas dioceses?<br/><br/>Creo que, en última instancia, a comisión desenvolverá nesa liña, e agora están en proceso de contratar expertos nesas áreas.<br/><br/>Creo que a Igrexa necesita entender que as igrexas locais poden aprender unhas das outras. E a miña comprensión sempre foi - e creo que o Santo Padre nos lembrou - que a Igrexa non funcionará como unha compañía centralizada. Non funciona así, efectivamente. Cada bispo, cada conferencia episcopal, ten, en certa medida, a súa vida pola súa conta. O que necesitamos aprender máis é abrir canles de comunicación mutua.<br/><br/>Hai unha serie de cousas que a xente culpa de abusos na Igrexa. Como sacerdote e psicólogo, e como alguén que coñeceu e traballou con superviventes, que pensa sobre ese tema?<br/><br/>Creo que a cuestión de onde veñen os abusos é a máis importante, e o Papa abordou isto na súa carta ao Pobo de Deus publicada o 20 de agosto. Di no primeiro parágrafo, e repíteo unha e outra vez, que a cuestión do abuso sexual está sempre ligada -ou case sempre ligada- non só á cuestión do abuso de poder, senón tamén ao abuso de conciencia.<br/><br/>Así que a verdadeira cuestión fundamental do abuso é moito máis complexa que só a cuestión da sexualidade, sexa heterosexual ou homosexual. É unha cuestión de poder, e hai que traballar realmente na cuestión de como entendemos o sacerdocio, como entendemos o episcopado, como entendemos e vivimos os nosos ministerios? Cales son os límites?<br/><br/>Por iso estou moi contento de que a provincia xesuíta de Australia estableza un código de conduta, porque non falamos só de abuso sexual de menores. Falamos do abuso sexual de adultos, e falamos do abuso doutras formas, como o abuso de conciencia, onde lle ditas a alguén o que pensas, ou finxes saber de Deus, e podes dicirlle a outra persoa, "Tes que facelo", contra a conciencia dese individuo.<br/><br/>Moitos pensan que o celibato produce abusos. Como sempre digo, o celibato como tal non é motivo para abusar – se non, como explicamos que o 99,9% de todos os abusadores non viven unha vida de celibato, e como explicamos que o 95% ou o 96% de todos os sacerdotes non abusan de menores? Pero o celibato, ou un voto de castidade, que non está realmente integrado, que non está realmente vivido axeitadamente, si, que produce un problema. Ás veces as persoas beben, ás veces xogan, e ás veces cometen mala conduta sexual, con adultos e con menores.<br/><br/>A verdadeira pregunta sobre isto é como facemos fronte á noción de poder espiritual relixioso coa que están investidos os sacerdotes e os bispos? Como pode a teoloxía axudarnos a comprender, e quizais como pode a socioloxía, a psicoloxía ou a administración de empresas axudarnos a definir os límites do poder e a necesidade de manter os teus límites? |
| I'm not surprised by this mismatch. In fact, I'd even go so far as to say this isn't something that will ever change, nor should we get all steamed up about changing it. In 10 years, we'll still have bleeding edge, complex items in the biggest concerns list, and the things we're finally getting around to understanding will be the major parts of our spending.<br/><br/>Now, Gunnar and Andy both have excellent points, specifically about IT teams seeing IT problems and solving them with IT solutions; in fact, I'm positive their points hold merit.<br/><br/>But I think there are other ideas that trump those (I did comment on their blogs about it, and later decided I should just blog here). Those top 3 concerns are bleedingly new such that:<br/><br/>we fear new things because we don't understand them, or don't understand them because they're new.<br/><br/>they're too new for us to have solid approaches to handling them.<br/><br/>they're too new for us to know if we should be worried or not! we tend to default to paranoid/worried, which is good!<br/><br/>too new to have obvious budget items assigned to them. Can I buy a box or some software that provide "cloud security" or "social media security?"<br/><br/>they're so new the business doesn't even know how to use them or what they want out of them. Let alone how we can secure them while still meeting or at least not stomping all over business needs. If the business doesn't even know how to use them yet, I'm not sure security is in any position to guide that usage securely.<br/><br/>It also should be mentioned that these new things are being largely pushed via consumerland and into the business, with IT as a sort of, "Oh yeah," thought. Firewalls, AV, AM, Auth are all IT responses to typically IT issues. Of course there is a difference there. They're also very subjective issues, as opposed to very objective items like firewalls, known malicious bits, behaviors, signatures, ports. Business presents very complex issues that are often involving people (which we can't patch) and that often don't fit nicely into blanket rules. Even if we turned away from technical solutions and devoted our time into solving these problems, they are still not going to be neatly solved. Likewise, when push comes to shove, can you have and meet goals with firewalls? Can you show improvement? All of this flows from the rather subjective non-technical aspect of those issues. Sort of the difference between a child's report card and the feedback you get from a parent-teacher conference. If you have a child, which one would you be most inclined to disagree with or not necessarily believe? (The answer is the subjective one!)<br/><br/>It could be said this is the natural progression of security and technology: from shoring up the technical controls to moving up the stack towards behavior and people. Sure, these 3 top concerns can be said to punch through firewalls and network segments, but that's the nature of those things (social media "punching" through a firewall is far different than me punching through an SSH connection to bridge my home network; social media is akin to the *way* I use my SSH connection after the hold is already punched because it is needed; i.e. social media is the way port 80 is used.)<br/><br/>Basically, all indications point to not being surprised by this dichotomy. And I don't think this is some further indication that IT/security is doing it wrong, or isn't aligned properly with business, or has a technical dark-server-room background. I'm not saying we're doing things right or we're properly aligned, but the above isn't a good argument to support the theory of those deficiencies.<br/><br/>Now for a really big jump. I'd liken the current increase in mobile computing to be as big as the introduction of computers into the business and later the PC/internet into business. Now, I wasn't around when the former happened, nor was I in the industry when the personal computer revolution swept into business, but I would bet that is the closest comparison so far. I may even say the same for social media. These are damned new and they're big changes beyond just bringing in Macs or new software or some new business process. | Non me sorprende este desaxuste. De feito, chegaría a dicir que isto non é algo que cambie nunca, nin deberíamos aburrirnos de cambialo. En 10 anos, aínda teremos elementos complexos na lista de maiores preocupacións, e as cousas que finalmente estamos a entender serán as principais partes do noso gasto.<br/><br/>Agora, Gunnar e Andy ambos teñen excelentes puntos, especificamente sobre os equipos de TI vendo problemas de TI e resolvelos con solucións de TI; de feito, estou seguro de que os seus puntos teñen mérito.<br/><br/>Pero creo que hai outras ideas que superan esas (comentei nos seus blogs sobre iso, e máis tarde decidín que só debería bloguear aquí). Esas 3 preocupacións principais son sangrantes novas tales que:<br/><br/>Tememos as cousas novas porque non as entendemos ou non as entendemos porque son novas.<br/><br/>Son demasiado novos para que teñamos enfoques sólidos para manexalos.<br/><br/>son demasiado novos para que saibamos se debemos estar preocupados ou non! tendemos a por defecto para paranoico / preocupado, o que é bo!<br/><br/>Demasiado novo para ter elementos orzamentarios obvios asignados a eles. Podo mercar unha caixa ou algún software que proporcione "seguridade na nube" ou "seguridade de redes sociais"?<br/><br/>son tan novos que o negocio nin sequera sabe como usalos ou o que queren deles. E moito menos como podemos aseguralos mentres aínda cumpren ou polo menos non pisotean todas as necesidades do negocio. Se a empresa aínda non sabe como usalos, non estou seguro de que a seguridade estea en posición de guiar ese uso de forma segura.<br/><br/>Tamén debe mencionarse que estas novas cousas están a ser empurradas en gran medida a través do país de consumo e no negocio, con TI como unha especie de, "Oh si," pensou. Firewalls, AV, AM, Auth son todas respostas de TI a problemas tipicamente de TI. Por suposto, hai unha diferenza. Tamén son cuestións moi subxectivas, a diferenza de elementos moi obxectivos como firewalls, bits maliciosos coñecidos, comportamentos, sinaturas, portos. Os negocios presentan problemas moi complexos que adoitan involucrar a xente (que non podemos parchear) e que moitas veces non encaixan ben nas regras xerais. Mesmo se nos afastamos das solucións técnicas e dedicamos o noso tempo a resolver estes problemas, aínda non se resolverán correctamente. Do mesmo xeito, cando se empurra, podes ter e cumprir obxectivos con firewalls? Podes mostrar melloras? Todo isto provén do aspecto non técnico máis ben subxectivo deses problemas. Unha especie de diferenza entre a tarxeta de informe dun neno e a retroalimentación que se obtén dunha conferencia pai-profesor. Se tes un fillo, cal sería o máis propenso a estar en desacordo ou non crer necesariamente? (A resposta é a subxectiva!)<br/><br/>Poderíase dicir que esta é a progresión natural da seguridade e a tecnoloxía: desde o fortalecemento dos controis técnicos ata o ascenso da pila cara ao comportamento e as persoas. Claro, estas 3 principais preocupacións poden ser ditas para perforar a través de firewalls e segmentos de rede, pero esa é a natureza desas cousas (as redes sociais "perforar" a través dun firewall é moi diferente que eu perforando a través dunha conexión SSH para conectar a miña rede doméstica; as redes sociais son semellantes á * vía * que uso a miña conexión SSH despois de que a retención xa está perforada porque é necesaria; é a porta 80).<br/><br/>Basicamente, todas as indicacións apuntan a que non nos sorprende esta dicotomía. E non creo que isto sexa outra indicación de que a seguridade/informática o está a facer mal, ou non está correctamente aliñada co negocio, ou ten un fondo técnico de sala escura. Non estou dicindo que estamos facendo as cousas ben ou que estamos correctamente aliñados, pero o anterior non é un bo argumento para apoiar a teoría destas deficiencias.<br/><br/>Agora, para dar un salto moi grande, compararía o aumento actual da computación móbil coa introdución de ordenadores no negocio e, máis tarde, a PC/Internet no negocio. Agora, eu non estaba por aquí cando ocorreu o primeiro, nin estaba na industria cando a revolución dos computadores persoais entrou nos negocios, pero aposto a que esa é a comparación máis próxima ata agora.
