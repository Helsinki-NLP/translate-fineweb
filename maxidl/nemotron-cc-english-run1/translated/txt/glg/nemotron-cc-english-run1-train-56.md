| While acknowledging that it's impossible to argue someone into loving something they hate, and vice versa, it's still often enjoyable to attempt the argument. When we talk to people whose opinions directly contradict ours, we're forced to defend our tastes, define our opinions, and analyze why we react the way we do. Which is why we have Why Don't You Like This?, in which two of our staffers will attempt to discover whether people with opposing opinions can get beyond "No, you're wrong!" and have a civil, constructive, and possibly even convincing discussion about their points of contention. Because no matter what talk radio says, there's still a middle ground between "We agree utterly" and "I'm right, and you're stupid and evil."<br/><br/>Scott: Since discussing my Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World apostasy, we've been looking for a case where I can call you out for not liking something wonderful, and we didn't have to look for long. We were sitting right next to each other during Martin Scorsese's Hugo—me, utterly enchanted by its fantastical tribute to the wonders of early silent cinema, and you, apparently resisting it at every turn. Critical consensus has been on my side: It hit the No. 9 spot on our collective Top 15 (though you listed it as your Overrated choice), has won (or placed) in various film-critic awards, and currently enjoys an 83 score on Metacritic. That doesn't mean you're wrong, of course, but the onus is on you to explain why Hugo was, in your words, "hollow and artificial," where many of us saw it as a lovely evocation of Scorsese's childhood and the medium when it was still in its infancy. And please be gentle as you rip this butterfly apart by the wings.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Tasha: I can't be gentle, Scott. Sometimes it hurts less if you rip the Band-Aid off all at once. (And even if it doesn't, who wants to walk around wearing a half-ripped-off Band-Aid? Gross.) The fact is, I found Hugo to be a wearyingly manipulative exercise in fakery, starting from its opening glide through a Paris train station, which reminded me more than anything of Robert Zemeckis' The Polar Express. Unlike Mike D'Angelo, I'm a fan of long, unbroken takes as a way of establishing a space and encouraging viewers to unconsciously hold their breaths as a camera explores an area; but when the space being explored is a slick, shiny CGI creation, and the camera floats weightlessly through it with no physical sense that either the camera or the surroundings are really there, that exploration starts to feel like watching someone else play a videogame. And the rest of the film felt similarly poreless and unreal to me, both in terms of its setting and in terms of its highly contrived, maudlin story.<br/><br/>I don't necessarily have a problem with manufactured, stylized environments in film. I loved Baz Luhrmann's equally sprawling, utterly artificial take on Paris in Moulin Rouge, for instance, but that film has a sense of its own ridiculousness, a sense of humor about how deliberately over-the-top it is. Ditto the stylization of Jean-Pierre Jeunet, particularly in Amélie. (Both Jeunet and Luhrmann felt like strong visual influences here.) I got the sense, however, that Martin Scorsese wanted me to take Hugo entirely seriously. Even though it's yet another achingly sentimental story about a plucky orphan bringing color back into the life of a grumpy old curmudgeon. And I just couldn't.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>There is nothing I enjoy more in film than being surprised. And there's nothing I resent and resist more than being overtly manipulated, being loudly told what to feel and when to feel it. A good film does this kind of thing subtly; a bad one uses crashing music cues and sweet strings—and in this case, a grubby, huge-eyed, disheveled orphan staring woefully at the camera—to demand pathos, and to tell viewers they're horrible people if they don't serve it up on demand. That said, I can deal with sad kids and grumpy adults making life better for each other—I really dug this year's Le Havre, which was essentially the same plot without all the cutesiness—but I find the artificial environments reflect badly on the artificial emotions, and each makes the other seem more fake by turns.<br/><br/>Let's start with that. In our overlooked films video, you and Noel both took Keith to task for championing Tyrannosaur, because you felt it wasn't realistic enough—too contrived, too miserablist, too much, too far. How is it possible that you can't buy a stymied old crank who breaks things when he's angry, but you can buy an orphan living inside a giant train-station clock and embarking upon a whimsical journey to repair a mysterious automaton that he believes might bear secrets from his dead father, but which instead leads him on a quirky voyage of self-discovery, into the magical land of cinema? Did you never find Hugo's gaudy rococo design, aggressive heartstring-plucking, or wheelbarrow-loads of quirk even a little excessive or hard to swallow?<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Scott: Jeunet and Luhrmann as influences on Scorsese?! Forget being indelicate, now you're deliberately poking me with a sharp stick. If you're looking for inspirations for Hugo—indeed, if you're looking for the emotional core of Hugo—you have to go back to Scorsese's childhood on Elizabeth Street in Little Italy, where an asthmatic little boy, unable to play outside with the other kids, retreated to Alexander Korda fantasies like The Thief Of Bagdad. Or, more simply, just go straight to the source himself: George Méliès, whose A Trip To The Moon remains the Big Bang of all cinematic fantasies, that moment when the camera was not used to document the world as it is, but whatever whimsical, magical, transporting place a filmmaker wants to invent for it. And that tradition has been developed and expanded upon for decades before the likes of Jeunet and Luhrmann got their grubby little paws on it.<br/><br/>And speaking of Jeunet, nice attempt to take away my rhetorical weapon, but I'll say it anyway: How can you love Amélie, yet find Hugo synthetic and "excessive" and "wearyingly manipulative"? You say that Amélie and Moulin Rouge have redeeming "sense of [their] own ridiculousness" where Scorsese means us to take Hugo seriously, and I don't think that's the case, at least on the latter point. That Scorsese feels evident passion about the movies is, I suppose, why you'd interpret Hugo as self-serious. But to me, it's those feelings that give the film an emotional ballast that the Luhrmann and Jeunet films don't have. All three films make aggressive use of the marvels of CGI—and Scorsese adds 3D to the mix, to wonderful effect—but where you and I differ is on the issue of weightlessness. I agree that CGI has a distancing effect; worlds composed entirely of digital plasticine are flexible to the point where they sometimes have no presence. You referred to Hugo in your "Overrated" entry for our Best Of Film piece as "a CGI gimcrack"—a perfect dis… for another movie.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>It's fair to say that Scorsese has built Hugo around a standard-issue, "heartstring-plucking" children's book/movie plot: Orphan misses his daddy, creates his own little fantasy world, gloms onto a new friend, convinces a crusty old fuddy-duddy to soften up and maybe adopt him. But that's just the narrative skeleton, and Scorsese provides plenty of flesh and blood. For one, you can't watch Hugo, the lonely boy, peering out from clock towers to the hustle-and-bustle of a Paris train station without thinking of Scorsese, another lonely boy, staring out of his bedroom window on Elizabeth Street. And even if you're not a big enough film nerd to make that connection, I really feel like Hugo's journey is not in finding a new father figure, but in persisting with the mechanical magic that stands as his own father's legacy. That's what film is: The persistence of vision that allows us to accept an illusory version of the world at 24 frames per second is science and magic at once. Hugo's relationship with Méliès isn't about him cozying up to a new daddy, but sharing a common enthusiasm the old man has submerged in bitterness. To me, that's a far more unique angle on a potentially shopworn premise.<br/><br/>Did you really find none of Hugo enchanting? Even the film's few detractors seem willing to admit that the sequences evoking cinema history and Méliès' studio—with Michael Stuhlbarg as the heroic film scholar!—were terrific. It felt, in the best possible way, like a heady compression of my History Of Film 101 class in college, condensing a semester's worth of clips and context into something between a montage and an animated pop-up book. And it speaks to the ingenious design of the film, which layers fact and fantasy so beautifully that it's at once a history of Méliès and the birth of cinema, and just the sort of simple, sumptuously produced cinematic wonder that Scorsese himself would have loved as a child. Thank goodness Hugo doesn't follow the Jeunet/Luhrmann model and have "a sense of its own ridiculousness." As a fantasy connoisseur yourself, wouldn't you say there's value in playing it straight and earnest and unabashed rather than winking at the audience? You may find Hugo sickly sweet, but I don't think the authenticity of its sentiment is to be denied.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Tasha: Yes, I did in fact find parts of Hugo enchanting. (Notice how I'm answering your question up front, whereas you were too busy frothing with apoplexy to address mine, though I assume that's an answer in its own right. Okay, "influence" may be overstating the case—I just meant the visual style looked very familiar. Though as Keith pointed out when you brought this up in person, Scorsese is neither opposed to drawing inspiration from other people's visuals, nor immune to it.) Primarily, I was enchanted by the parts dealing with Georges Méliès' backstory, with his love of cinema, with the work he put into his art and the joy he got out of it. There's an awful lot of beauty and fun in the staging of the underwater-court scene from Méliès' "Fairyland," and in the sequence at the end, focusing on Méliès footage. I'll grant you that Hugo's connection with Méliès over a shared love of film is a nice touch. And I do enjoy a good film about filmmaking.<br/><br/>But Hugo isn't primarily about film, in spite of the Méliès tie-ins. In addition to the themes you cite, it's also about finding your purpose, as the characters expressly, laboriously explain to each other and to us. And it's about spectacle, and big action setpieces, and chases, and happily-ever-after endings where even the angry bully and the shy older couple and fergawdsakes even the cranky dachshund all get paired off with charming love interests by the end. It's about the super-precocious Hermione Granger-type being bossy and perky and clever and praising the magical worlds encased in books. And all of this business is mighty familiar, and mighty artificial.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Yes, Scorsese is playing with archetypes. Problem is, I never felt he imbued them with anything new, fresh, or believable, in spite of his own backstory. I would have much preferred a story about a young Scorsese growing up with asthma—something small-scale and real, without vast rooms full of CGI clockwork and golden glowing dust-motes and prophetic dreams and a raging adult tyrant-guard with a heart of gold—all of that outsized, over-the-top nonsense. You keep citing Scorsese's personal background and love of film as evidence that he's really feeling what he's putting on the screen, but I don't feel his personal touch in any of this, except the moments that are expressly about film. The core emotions may be real, but that doesn't make the execution less false.<br/><br/>You say the authenticity of the emotion isn't to be denied. I don't question whether Scorsese personally felt lonely and isolated as a child, but I don't feel loneliness and isolation on the screen—I see a bunch of exaggerated signifiers (Hugo is filthy and his clothes are worn and all the adults yell at him and he regularly gets chased by a scary dog!) and big beats, with shouting and weeping and Spielbergian wonder-emoting. For me, sincerity is more convincing and more personal when it's quiet and direct; when someone's shouting his opinions at me, I assume he's either really angry, or just trying to overwhelm my senses to keep me from expressing my own opinion. Hugo was one long shout, as far as I was concerned.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Why didn't I get that sense of fakery from Amélie, you ask? Actually, I did. I'll completely acknowledge that Amélie and Moulin Rouge are both big, manipulative, artificial constructions in the exact same vein, demanding specific emotions at specific intervals, and trying to sell those emotions with heavy emoting and aggressive soundtrack prodding. Neither of them really sold me on their emotions as authentic human feeling. What I enjoyed in those two films was the construction—particularly Amélie's heady, laughable lists of random characterizing features and experiences for its cast, and Moulin Rouge's musical-magpie mashups and recontextualizations. I'm often sold on stories that do creative or ambitious things with structure, and both of those movies qualify, where Hugo is a much more linear, standard kid-quest.<br/><br/>But in the end, for me, it really does come down to a feeling that those movies are goofs, whereas Hugo is meant to be taken seriously at every treacly moment. You don't think that's true—but you're simultaneously defending its integrity in terms of its absolutely authentic, rooted-in-Scorsese's-history emotion, and telling me I'm wrong, and he doesn't mean it to be taken seriously. How do you reconcile those two statements? What about the film suggests to you that it isn't meant to be taken at face value? And is it possible this is just another Curious Case Of Benjamin Button-like situation where I find the use of kids in big-budget films to be largely sappy and melodramatic, whereas you as a dad find it bypasses your cynicism and goes straight to your family-feeling?<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Scott: Not sure I meant that Scorsese doesn't mean to be taken seriously; it's just that he's chosen a whimsical vehicle through which to express a serious love of the movies. When you say, "But Hugo isn't primarily about film, in spite of the Méliès tie-ins," I'm mystified. I grant that you find many elements of Hugo overly familiar and laborious and full of Spielbergian wonder-emoting—there's nothing I can do to argue around that perception, which other Hugo doubters share. Sometimes a film means to charm and enchant, and it doesn't for some; you've got Hugo and I've got Amélie, though I think the latter, deliberately artificial as it is, means for us to find it romantic. (Rather than, say, some horrible mechanical contraption fit for a Saw sequel.)<br/><br/>But to say Hugo isn't primarily about film? If it's not about film, then it's the most pointlessly discursive story about [whatever you think it's about] I've ever seen. The relationship between Hugo and Méliès is the heart of the movie, and at the heart of that is not just some stock connection between Plucky Orphan and Crusty Old Guy With A Heart Of Gold, but a shared affinity for engineered magic—specifically the magic of the movies. I think Scorsese and his collaborators have found a way to express their enthusiasm over the early days of cinema through a fantasy that's accessible to all ages. The archetype-filled children's tale is the merely the crust here; cinema is the pie. (Mmmm… pie.)<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>As for The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button, I don't see much of a connection, other than trying to expose me as a Benjamin Button defender as a way of damaging my credibility. (Incidentally, how are the extras on that G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra Blu-ray?) I've said to you that the sleep-deprived new dad in me was perhaps vulnerable to Benjamin Button, but I can't imagine a time when the premise of aging in reverse wouldn't move me. (Cradling the love of your life in your arms as an infant? How can you not be affected by that?) And besides, I don't see how Benjamin Button relates much to Hugo as a film concerning kids, since that's just a small segment of a story that spans a much larger trajectory.<br/><br/>So have I convinced you? Likely not. But I'm happy to learn that Hugo wasn't entirely devoid of enchantments for you. The sequences on Méliès the filmmaker are what put Hugo over for me—and in that, at least, we can share some movie love.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Tasha: Nope, I can't say you've convinced me, any more than I've convinced you. It's impossible to argue anyone into a visceral love of anything, and it really should be equally impossible to talk someone down from visceral love. Mostly, you've let me see Hugo in Scott-O-Vision, which is an interesting experience; at least now I'm mildly convinced that we didn't somehow manage to see entirely different films which both somehow had the same name and director.<br/><br/>We certainly had different experiences, though, and to my mind, focused on different aspects of the production: I still don't see the "film is marvelous" theme as the movie's single strand, so much as one among too many. "Pointlessly discursive" almost covers it, though I'd throw in "often needlessly cutesy and precious" on top of that. While you're focused on the film's tasty pie filling, I feel like that pie was covered with a pound of crystallized sugar, and I think that does make a difference, regardless of the film's core message or handful of terrific scenes. See also Benjamin Button, which I did not bring up just to chafe you—I really do think you have more of a sentimental streak than I do regarding children in cinema, especially when they're used more as symbols of vulnerability and innocence than as human characters. Hey, you know what film totally does not have cute wide-eyed moppets bringing hope to a cynical world? G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra. Maybe I will go watch those Blu-ray extras. I could use some explosion-insulin to compensate for Hugo's sweetness. | Aínda que recoñecer que é imposible argumentar que alguén ama algo que odia, e viceversa, aínda é a miúdo agradable para tentar o argumento. Cando falamos con persoas cuxas opinións contradicen directamente as nosas, vémonos obrigados a defender os nosos gustos, definir as nosas opinións e analizar por que reaccionamos do xeito que facemos. Por iso temos Why Don't You Like This?, no que dous dos nosos empregados intentarán descubrir se as persoas con opinións opostas poden ir máis aló de "Non, estás equivocado!" e ter unha discusión civil, construtiva e posiblemente mesmo convincente sobre os seus puntos de disputa. Porque non importa o que diga a radio, aínda hai un punto medio entre "acordamos totalmente" e "teño razón, e vostede é estúpido e malvado".<br/><br/>Scott: Desde que discutimos o meu Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World apostasy, estivemos buscando un caso no que poida chamarte por non gustar de algo marabilloso, e non tivemos que buscar moito tempo. Estabamos sentados un ao lado do outro durante o Hugo de Martin Scorsese, eu, completamente encantado polo seu fantástico tributo ás marabillas do cinema mudo temperán, e ti, aparentemente resistíndolle en cada momento. O consenso crítico estivo do meu lado: alcanzou o número 9 no noso Top 15 colectivo (aínda que o listaches como a túa escolla sobrevalorada), gañou (ou colocou) en varios premios de crítica de películas, e actualmente goza dunha puntuación de 83 en Metacritic. Iso non significa que esteas equivocado, por suposto, pero a responsabilidade é túa para explicar por que Hugo era, nas túas palabras, "oco e artificial", onde moitos de nós o vimos como unha fermosa evocación da infancia de Scorsese e o medio cando aínda estaba na súa infancia. E por favor, sé amable mentres rasgas esta bolboreta polas ás.<br/><br/>Anuncio<br/><br/>Tasha: Non podo ser amable, Scott. Ás veces doe menos se arrancas o Band-Aid dunha soa vez. (E aínda que non o faga, quen quere camiñar por aí usando un Band-Aid medio arrancado? Gross.) O feito é que atopei a Hugo como un exercicio de manipulación fatigante na falsificación, comezando desde a súa apertura deslizando a través dunha estación de tren de París, o que me recordou máis que nada ao Polar Express de Robert Zemeckis. A diferenza de Mike D'Angelo, eu son un fan de longo, ininterrompido toma como unha forma de establecer un espazo e animar aos espectadores a reter inconscientemente a respiración como unha cámara explora unha área; pero cando o espazo que está a ser explorado é unha creación CGI lixeira e brillante, e a cámara flota sen peso a través dela sen ningún outro sentido físico que a cámara ou o entorno están realmente alí. E o resto do filme semellaba igualmente irreal, tanto en termos da súa ambientación como en termos da súa historia moi inventada.<br/><br/>Non teño necesariamente un problema cos ambientes manufacturados e estilizados no cine. Encántame a visión igualmente extensa e totalmente artificial de Baz Luhrmann sobre París no Moulin Rouge, por exemplo, pero esa película ten un sentido do seu propio ridículo, un sentido do humor sobre o deliberadamente excesivo que é. Coa estilización de Jean-Pierre Jeunet, particularmente en Amélie (tanto Jeunet como Luhrmann sentían fortes influencias visuais aquí) tiven a sensación, con todo, de que Martin Scorsese quería que eu tomase a Hugo totalmente en serio. Aínda que é outra historia sentimental sobre un orfo que devolve a cor á vida dun vello curmudgeon malhumorado.<br/><br/>Anuncio<br/><br/>Non hai nada que me guste máis no cine que ser sorprendido, e non hai nada que me resentir e resistir máis que ser manipulado abertamente, dicíndome en voz alta o que sentir e cando sentilo. Un bo filme fai este tipo de cousas de xeito sutil; un malo usa pistas musicais e cordas doces -e neste caso, un orfo sucio, de ollos enormes, desconcertado mirando a cámara con pena- para esixir pathos, e para dicir aos espectadores que son persoas horribles se non o serven baixo demanda. Dito isto, podo tratar con nenos tristes e adultos malhumorados que fan a vida mellor uns para os outros - eu realmente cavei Le Havre deste ano, que era esencialmente a mesma trama sen toda a cutelessidade - pero eu atopo que os ambientes artificiais reflicten mal sobre as emocións artificiais, e cada un fai o outro parece máis falso por voltas.<br/><br/>Comecemos con iso. No noso vídeo de películas esquecidas, ti e Noel levastes a Keith á tarefa de defender o Tiranosaurio, porque sentíades que non era o suficientemente realista, demasiado inventado, demasiado miserable, demasiado lonxe. Como é posible que non poidas mercar un vello maniquí que rompe cousas cando está enfadado, pero podes mercar un orfo que vive dentro dun reloxo xigante da estación de tren e embarcarse nunha viaxe caprichosa para reparar un misterioso autómata que cre que pode levar segredos do seu pai morto, pero que no seu lugar lévao nunha viaxe peculiar de autodescubrimento, á terra máxica do cinema? Nunca atopou o deseño rococó de Hugo, o agresivo arranca-corazóns, ou cargas de peculiaridades, aínda que sexan un pouco excesivas ou difíciles de tragar?<br/><br/>Anuncio<br/><br/>Scott: Jeunet e Luhrmann como influencias en Scorsese?! Esqueza ser indelicado, agora está deliberadamente me picando cun pau afiado. Se buscas inspiración para Hugo, de feito, se buscas o núcleo emocional de Hugo, tes que volver á infancia de Scorsese en Elizabeth Street en Little Italy, onde un neno asmático, incapaz de xogar fóra cos outros nenos, retirouse ás fantasías de Alexander Korda como O ladrón de Bagdad. Ou, máis simplemente, simplemente ir directamente á fonte en si: George Méliès, cuxa viaxe á Lúa segue sendo o Big Bang de todas as fantasías cinematográficas, aquel momento no que a cámara non se usaba para documentar o mundo tal como é, senón calquera lugar caprichoso, máxico, transportando que un cineasta queira inventar para el. E esa tradición desenvolveuse e expandiuse durante décadas antes de que Jeunet e Luhrmann obtivesen as súas pequenas patas sucias.<br/><br/>E falando de Jeunet, bo intento de quitarme a arma retórica, pero vou dicilo de todos os xeitos: como podes amar a Amélie, pero atopar a Hugo sintético e "excesivo" e "cansosamente manipulador"? Vostede di que Amélie e Moulin Rouge teñen un "senso do seu propio ridículo" onde Scorsese quere que nos tomemos a Hugo en serio, e non creo que sexa o caso, polo menos neste último punto. Que Scorsese senta unha evidente paixón polo cinema é, supoño, por que interpretarías a Hugo como serio consigo mesmo, pero para min, son eses sentimentos os que lle dan ao filme un lastre emocional que os filmes de Luhrmann e Jeunet non teñen. Os tres filmes fan un uso agresivo das marabillas do CGI, e Scorsese engade 3D á mestura, cun efecto marabilloso, pero onde difiren vostedes e eu está a cuestión da ingravidez. Estou de acordo en que o CGI ten un efecto de distanciamento; os mundos compostos enteiramente de plastilina dixital son flexibles ata o punto de que ás veces non teñen presenza. Vostede referiuse a Hugo na súa entrada "Overrated" para a nosa peza Best Of Film como "un gimcrack CGI" - un dis perfecto ... para outra película.<br/><br/>Anuncio<br/><br/>É xusto dicir que Scorsese construíu a Hugo en torno a unha trama de libros infantís: Orphan bota de menos ao seu pai, crea o seu propio mundo de fantasía, convence a un vello fuddy-duddy para que se suavice e quizais o adopte. Pero iso é só o esqueleto narrativo, e Scorsese proporciona moita carne e sangue. Por un lado, non se pode ver a Hugo, o neno solitario, mirando desde as torres do reloxo ao axitado e axitado dunha estación de tren de París sen pensar en Scorsese, outro neno solitario, mirando pola fiestra do seu dormitorio en Elizabeth Street. E aínda que non sexas un nerd do cine o suficientemente grande como para facer esa conexión, realmente sinto que a viaxe de Hugo non consiste en atopar unha nova figura paterna, senón en persistir coa maxia mecánica que se ergue como o legado do seu propio pai. A persistencia da visión que nos permite aceptar unha versión ilusoria do mundo a 24 fotogramas por segundo é ciencia e maxia á vez. A relación de Hugo con Méliès non se trata de que se achegue a un novo pai, senón de que comparta un entusiasmo común que o vello mergullou na amargura. Para min, ese é un ángulo moito máis único nunha premisa potencialmente desgastada.<br/><br/>Mesmo os poucos detractores do filme parecen dispostos a admitir que as secuencias que evocan a historia do cinema e o estudio de Méliès, con Michael Stuhlbarg como o heroico erudito cinematográfico, foron fantásticas. Sentímolo, da mellor maneira posible, como unha embriagante compresión da miña clase de Historia do Cinema 101 na universidade, condensando o valor dun semestre de clips e contexto en algo entre unha montaxe e un libro pop-up animado. E fala do deseño enxeñoso da película, que engade feitos e fantasía tan fermosamente que é ao mesmo tempo unha historia de Méliès e o nacemento do cinema, e só a especie de marabilla cinematográfica simple e suntuosa que o propio Scorsese amaría de neno. Grazas a Deus Hugo non segue o modelo de Jeunet/Luhrmann e ten "un sentido da súa propia ridiculez". Como coñecedor de fantasía vostede mesmo, non diría que hai valor en xoga-lo directo e serio e desavergoñado en vez de guiñar ao público? Pode atopar Hugo enfermizo doce, pero eu non creo que a autenticidade do seu sentimento é para ser negado.<br/><br/>Anuncio<br/><br/>Tasha: Si, de feito atopei partes de Hugo encantadoras. (Nota como estou respondendo á túa pregunta de antemán, mentres que estabas demasiado ocupado espumando con apoplexía para abordar a miña, aínda que supoño que é unha resposta por si mesma. Ok, "influencia" pode estar sobrevalorando o caso - eu só quería dicir que o estilo visual parecía moi familiar. Aínda que como Keith sinalou cando mencionou isto en persoa, Scorsese non se opón a inspirarse nas imaxes doutras persoas, nin é inmune a iso.) En primeiro lugar, quedei encantado coas partes que tratan da historia de fondo de Georges Méliès, co seu amor polo cine, co traballo que puxo na súa arte e a alegría que obtivo. Hai moita beleza e diversión na escenificación da escena submarina de "Fairyland" de Méliès, e na secuencia ao final, centrándose nas imaxes de Méliès. Concedovos que a conexión de Hugo con Méliès sobre un amor compartido polo cine é un bo toque, e gozo dun bo filme sobre cine.<br/><br/>Pero Hugo non se trata principalmente de cine, a pesar dos lazos de Méliès. Ademais dos temas que citas, tamén se trata de atopar o teu propósito, como os personaxes expresamente, laboriosamente se explican entre si e a nós. E é sobre espectáculo, e grandes escenas de acción, e persecucións, e finais felices para sempre, onde mesmo o acosador enfadado e a parella de vellos tímidos e fergawdsakes mesmo o texugo irritable todo se emparella con intereses amorosos encantadores ao final. É sobre a súper precoz Hermione Granger sendo dominante, alegre e intelixente e eloxiando os mundos máxicos encerrados nos libros. E todo este negocio é moi familiar e moi artificial.<br/><br/>Anuncio<br/><br/>Si, Scorsese está xogando con arquetipos. O problema é que nunca sentín que os imbuíse con nada novo, fresco ou creíble, a pesar da súa propia historia. Eu preferiría moito unha historia sobre un mozo Scorsese crecendo con asma, algo a pequena escala e real, sen grandes habitacións cheas de reloxos CGI e sons dourados e proféticos, e un tirano adulto furioso cun corazón de ouro. Vostede segue citando os antecedentes persoais de Scorsese e o seu amor polo cinema como proba de que realmente sente o que está poñendo na pantalla, pero non sinto o seu toque persoal en nada disto, excepto nos momentos que son expresamente sobre o cinema. As emocións centrais poden ser reais, pero iso non fai que a execución sexa menos falsa.<br/><br/>Vostede di que a autenticidade da emoción non se pode negar. Non me pregunto se Scorsese persoalmente se sentía soa e illada cando era neno, pero non sinto soidade e illamento na pantalla: vexo un montón de significados esaxerados (Hugo está sucio e as súas roupas están desgastadas e todos os adultos berranlle e regularmente é perseguido por un can asustado!) e grandes ritmos, con berros e choros. Para min, a sinceridade é máis convincente e máis persoal cando é silenciosa e directa; cando alguén está berrando as súas opinións sobre min, supoño que está realmente enfadado, ou simplemente tentando abrumar os meus sentidos para evitar que exprese a miña propia opinión. Hugo foi un grito longo, en canto a min.<br/><br/>Anuncio<br/><br/>Por que non recibín esa sensación de falsidade de Amélie? Reconocerei completamente que Amélie e Moulin Rouge son ambas grandes, manipuladoras, construcións artificiais na mesma vea, esixindo emocións específicas a intervalos específicos, e tratando de vender esas emocións con fortes emocións e agresiva banda sonora. Ningunha delas me vendeu realmente sobre as súas emocións como auténtico sentimento humano. O que me gustou neses dous filmes foi a construción, especialmente as embriagantes e ridículas listas de características e experiencias aleatorias de Amélie para o seu elenco, e os mashups e recontextualizacións de Moulin Rouge. A miúdo vendo historias que fan cousas creativas ou ambiciosas con estrutura, e ambas as películas cualifican, onde Hugo é unha misión infantil moito máis lineal e estándar.<br/><br/>Pero ao final, para min, realmente chega a unha sensación de que esas películas son parvadas, mentres que Hugo está destinado a ser tomado en serio en cada momento tráxico. Non pensas que é verdade, pero ao mesmo tempo estás defendendo a súa integridade en termos da súa emoción absolutamente auténtica, enraizada na historia de Scorsese, e dicindo que estou equivocado, e non quere que se tome en serio. Como concilias esas dúas afirmacións? Que che suxire o filme que non está destinado a ser tomado ao valor nominal? E é posible que esta sexa só outra situación semellante ao Curioso caso de Benjamin Button na que atopo que o uso de nenos en películas de gran orzamento é en gran parte melodramático e melodramático, mentres que ti, como pai, atopas que elude o teu cinismo e vai directamente ao teu sentimento familiar?<br/><br/>Anuncio<br/><br/>Scott: Non estou seguro de que quixese dicir que Scorsese non quere ser tomado en serio; é só que elixiu un vehículo caprichoso a través do cal expresar un amor serio polo cinema. Cando dis: "Pero Hugo non é principalmente sobre o cine, a pesar dos lazos de Méliès", estou desconcertado. Concedo que atopes moitos elementos de Hugo excesivamente familiares e laboriosos e cheos de emocións marabillosas de Spielberg; non hai nada que poida facer para argumentar en torno a esa percepción, que outros dubidadores de Hugo comparten. Ás veces unha película significa encanto e encanto, e para algúns non; tes a Hugo e eu teño a Amélie, aínda que creo que esta última, deliberadamente artificial como é, significa para nós atopala romántica. (En lugar de, digamos, algún truco mecánico horrible axeitado para unha secuela de Saw.)<br/><br/>Pero para dicir que Hugo non é principalmente sobre o cine? Se non é sobre o cine, entón é a historia máis inutilmente discursiva sobre [o que pensas que é] que vin. A relación entre Hugo e Méliès é o corazón da película, e no corazón diso non está só algunha conexión de stock entre Plucky Orphan e Crusty Old Guy With A Heart Of Gold, senón unha afinidade compartida pola maxia enxeñada, especificamente a maxia das películas. Creo que Scorsese e os seus colaboradores atoparon un xeito de expresar o seu entusiasmo durante os primeiros días do cine a través dunha fantasía que é accesible a todas as idades. O conto infantil cheo de arquetipos é simplemente a codia aquí; o cinema é a torta. (Mmmm... pé.)<br/><br/>Anuncio<br/><br/>En canto a The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, non vexo moita conexión, agás tentar expoñerme como un defensor de Benjamin Button como unha forma de danar a miña credibilidade. (A propósito, como están os extras de G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra Blu-ray?) Díxenvos que o meu novo pai, privado de sono, era quizais vulnerable a Benjamin Button, pero non podo imaxinar un momento no que a premisa do envellecemento ao revés non me movese. E ademais, non vexo como Benjamin Button se relaciona moito con Hugo como unha película sobre nenos, xa que é só un pequeno segmento dunha historia que abrangue unha traxectoria moito maior.<br/><br/>Así que te convencín? Probablemente non. Pero estou feliz de saber que Hugo non estaba totalmente desprovisto de encantos para ti. As secuencias sobre Méliès o cineasta son o que puxo Hugo sobre para min - e nese, polo menos, podemos compartir algún amor cinematográfico.<br/><br/>Anuncio<br/><br/>Tasha: Non, non podo dicir que me convenceu, máis do que eu te convenceu. É imposible argumentar a ninguén nun amor visceral de calquera cousa, e realmente debería ser igualmente imposible falar a alguén de amor visceral. Sobre todo, deixáchesme ver a Hugo en Scott-O-Vision, o que é unha experiencia interesante; polo menos agora estou levemente convencido de que non conseguimos ver películas totalmente diferentes que, dalgunha maneira, tiñan o mesmo nome e director.<br/><br/>Certamente tivemos experiencias diferentes, pero, na miña opinión, centradas en diferentes aspectos da produción: aínda non vexo o tema de "filme é marabilloso" como a única vertente da película, tanto como un entre moitos. "Pointlessly discursive" case o cobre, aínda que eu tiraría en "moitas veces innecesariamente amable e precioso" enriba diso. Mentres estás enfocado no saboroso recheo de tarta da película, sinto que esa tarta estaba cuberta cunha libra de azucre cristalizado, e creo que iso fai a diferenza, independentemente da mensaxe central do filme ou dun puñado de escenas fantásticas. Véxase tamén Benjamin Button, ao que non mencionei só para irritarte: realmente creo que tes máis unha raia sentimental que eu respecto aos nenos no cine, especialmente cando se usan máis como símbolos de vulnerabilidade e inocencia que como personaxes humanos. Hey, sabes que película non ten monicreques de ollos anchos que traian esperanza a un mundo cínico? G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra. Quizais vou ver eses extras en Blu-ray. Podería usar unha explosión de insulina para compensar a dozura de Hugo. |
| "I hoped my daughter would be free from difficult and troubling times": Mee Mee's story as a refugee Mom<br/><br/>Hope in Times of Crisis: A Mother's Day Story<br/><br/>By Judith Santiago*<br/><br/>Mee Mee heard that the soldiers were coming. She took hold of her son and frantically joined the rest of the villagers who were running toward the Thai-Burmese border, where the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) was located. Her husband was in another village running in the opposite direction, Mee later learned. After the soldiers' pursuit ended, Mee returned home to her small village in Koechi, Burma.<br/><br/>During 1997-2000, Mee and thousands like her lived under the constant threat of violence from Burmese soldiers. Many people would take temporary refuge in the jungle, and return home to their village after soldiers left the area, just to do it all over again days later. About once a week, Mee and others would be on the move to avoid capture, rape, or death by soldiers.<br/><br/>During one incident, Mee's husband ran ahead of his wife to secure food for his family. Her husband was spotted by soldiers and shot. The bullet shattered a portion of his ribcage, leaving him severely wounded and in distress as he journeyed toward the jungle with his family for safety.<br/><br/>For three months, Mee's husband hid and moved the family with an exasperating wound at his side. He received no medical care, except for Mee's tending.<br/><br/>"I was afraid to return to Burma," Mee said through an interpreter. "I feared dying. I cried and cried every day," she continued.<br/><br/>Mee's husband eventually drew enough strength to walk five days toward a small village in Thailand where they learned the location of a hospital and a refugee camp. When Mee and her husband finally arrived at the hospital, he underwent immediate surgery and later recovered.<br/><br/>Symbol of Hope<br/><br/>Life in the jungle for those fleeing Burmese soldiers was indeed terrifying and difficult. Makeshift bamboo tents with only roof and floor coverings became suitable temporary dwellings. Many women including Mee gave birth to children in the jungle. Mee's then six-year-old son assisted in the delivery of his sister named Eh Ku Hser. Her name means love – cold – sweet. "Cold" in Burmese culture means so as to not pass through the fire of life, as heat represents troubled times.<br/><br/>"I hoped my daughter would be free from difficult and troubling times," said Mee. "I did not want her to go through what I had experienced," she continued.<br/><br/>For Mee, the birth of her daughter in the midst of darkness, torment and fear, was a symbol of hope for a new life to come. Hope in times of crisis, the very premise of the United Methodist Committee on Relief's (UMCOR) newly co-branded UMCOR-Prosperity Candle, is also the essence of that which candles shed light upon.<br/><br/>A New Beginning<br/><br/>With the help of UNHCR, hope for a new life did indeed materialize for Mee and her family when they resettled in West Springfield, Massachusetts. There, Mee met Moo Kho Paw, another woman who emigrated from Burma, and who was working at Prosperity Candle in Florence. The organization helps refugee women who have escaped areas of conflict rebuild their lives through the art of candle making. Moo Kho recommended that Mee join the organization, and Mee gladly accepted.<br/><br/>"I was excited to be out of the house," said Mee, "I was raised to believe that because I was a woman, my role was to remain at home and raise my family," she continued. "While many Burmese women want to do more for themselves, they are often encouraged to remain homemakers."<br/><br/>Today, Mee has plans to go into the candle-making business for herself and support her five children, but she expressed the need to learn English first.<br/><br/>"In the Thai refugee camp, we had education, but it was not so good," said Mee. "When I was a child, I wanted to go to school, but I was told to stay home because I was a woman. Now, I have hopes for my daughters to go to college and become doctors or policewomen," continued Mee.<br/><br/>Mee has struck an even balance in her life that she wishes others would have found—a simple, happy life where work, caring for family members and freedom of choice all have their place.<br/><br/>Support Refugee Women in the US<br/><br/>Share this Mother's Day story with your loved ones. And, when you purchase handmade candles by Mee, Moo Kho, and Naw, another Burmese refugee woman working at Prosperity Candle , know you are helping to support their livelihood as they rebuild their lives and those of their family members in the US. | "Eu esperaba que a miña filla ía estar libre de tempos difíciles e preocupantes": a historia de Mee Mee como unha nai refuxiada<br/><br/>Esperanza en tempos de crise: unha historia do Día da Nai<br/><br/>por Judith Santiago<br/><br/>Mee Mee escoitou que os soldados viñan. Agarrou ao seu fillo e uniuse frenéticamente ao resto dos veciños que corrían cara á fronteira tailandés-birmanesa, onde se atopaba a Oficina do Alto Comisionado das Nacións Unidas para os Refuxiados (ACNUR). O seu marido estaba noutra aldea correndo na dirección oposta, Mee aprendeu máis tarde. Despois de que rematase a persecución dos soldados, Mee volveu a casa á súa pequena aldea en Koechi, Birmania.<br/><br/>Durante 1997-2000, Mee e miles coma ela viviron baixo a constante ameaza da violencia dos soldados birmanos. Moitas persoas tomarían refuxio temporal na selva, e volverían á súa aldea despois de que os soldados deixasen a zona, só para facelo de novo días despois. Unha vez por semana, Mee e outros estarían en movemento para evitar a captura, violación ou morte por soldados.<br/><br/>Durante un incidente, o marido de Mee correu por diante da súa esposa para asegurar comida para a súa familia. A bala rompeu unha porción da súa caixa torácica, deixándoo gravemente ferido e en apuros mentres viaxaba cara á selva coa súa familia por seguridade.<br/><br/>Durante tres meses, o marido de Mee agochouse e trasladou á familia cunha ferida exasperante ao seu lado.<br/><br/>"Tiña medo de volver a Birmania", dixo Mee a través dun intérprete. "Tiña medo de morrer. Eu choraba e choraba todos os días", continuou ela.<br/><br/>O marido de Mee conseguiu forzas suficientes para camiñar cinco días cara a unha pequena aldea en Tailandia, onde aprenderon a localización dun hospital e un campo de refuxiados. Cando Mee e o seu marido finalmente chegaron ao hospital, sufriu unha cirurxía inmediata e máis tarde recuperouse.<br/><br/>Símbolo de esperanza<br/><br/>A vida na xungla para aqueles que fuxían dos soldados birmanos era realmente aterradora e difícil. As tendas de bambú improvisadas con só cubertas de teito e piso convertéronse en vivendas temporais adecuadas. Moitas mulleres, incluíndo Mee, deron a luz a nenos na xungla. O fillo de Mee, entón de seis anos, axudou no parto da súa irmá chamada Eh Ku Hser. O seu nome significa amor - frío - doce. "Frío" na cultura birmana significa para non pasar polo lume da vida, xa que a calor representa tempos difíciles.<br/><br/>"Eu esperaba que a miña filla ía estar libre de tempos difíciles e problemáticos", dixo Mee. "Eu non quería que ela pasar polo que eu experimentara", continuou ela.<br/><br/>Para Mee, o nacemento da súa filla no medio da escuridade, o tormento e o medo, era un símbolo de esperanza para unha nova vida por vir. A esperanza en tempos de crise, a premisa mesma da nova vela UMCOR-Prosperity da UMCOR (United Methodist Committee on Relief), é tamén a esencia do que as velas arroxan luz.<br/><br/>Un novo comezo<br/><br/>Coa axuda do ACNUR, a esperanza dunha nova vida materializouse para Mee e a súa familia cando se reasentaron en West Springfield, Massachusetts. Alí, Mee coñeceu a Moo Kho Paw, outra muller que emigrou de Birmania, e que traballaba en Prosperity Candle en Florencia. A organización axuda ás mulleres refuxiadas que escaparon de áreas de conflito a reconstruír as súas vidas a través da arte de facer velas. Moo Kho recomendou que Mee se unise á organización, e Mee aceptou con gusto.<br/><br/>"Estaba emocionada de estar fóra da casa", dixo Mee, "crecín para crer que porque era unha muller, o meu papel era permanecer na casa e criar á miña familia", continuou. Aínda que moitas mulleres birmanas queren facer máis por si mesmas, moitas veces son alentadas a seguir sendo amas de casa.<br/><br/>Hoxe, Mee ten plans para entrar no negocio de fabricación de velas por si mesma e apoiar aos seus cinco fillos, pero expresou a necesidade de aprender inglés primeiro.<br/><br/>"No campo de refuxiados tailandeses, tiñamos educación, pero non era tan bo", dixo Mee. "Cando eu era un neno, quería ir á escola, pero dixéronme que quedase na casa porque era unha muller. Agora, teño esperanzas de que as miñas fillas vaian á universidade e se convertan en doutoras ou policías", continuou Mee.<br/><br/>Mee atopou un equilibrio na súa vida que desexaría que outros atopasen: unha vida sinxela e feliz onde o traballo, o coidado dos membros da familia e a liberdade de elección teñen o seu lugar.<br/><br/>Apoio ás mulleres refuxiadas nos Estados Unidos<br/><br/>Comparte esta historia do Día da Nai cos teus seres queridos. E, cando compras velas feitas a man por Mee, Moo Kho e Naw, outra muller refuxiada birmana que traballa en Prosperity Candle, sabes que estás axudando a manter os seus medios de subsistencia mentres reconstruen as súas vidas e as dos seus familiares nos Estados Unidos. |
| The Precedency Essay<br/><br/>1562 words - 7 pages<br/><br/>Affirmative action is a government policy that gives opportunities to minorities, women, and any group who has been the victim of discrimination in the past. Affirmative action is the outcome of the 1960's Civil Rights movement, growing out of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 which outlawed discrimination based on race, ethnicity, or gender. It was the 1978 Supreme Court decision, The Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, which allowed for the use of race-based preferences as a means of fostering diversity, allowing affirmative action to be used in admissions policies. It was created with the intention to provide equal opportunities for members of minority groups in education and ...view middle of the document...<br/><br/>However, according to a 2007 report by the Pew Research Center, support for affirmative action among the American public has actually increased substantiallyin recent years, climbing from 58% in 1995 to 70% in 2007. Supporters of affirmative action make many arguments in support of affirmative action, in the hopes of getting others to see the genuine good that affirmative actin policies bring to our society. Supporters believe that affirmative action is more of a process rather than an admissions policy. Colleges and universities take the extra initiative to reach out to minority groups, encouraging them to apply. Colleges and universities offer additional financial aid and provide on-campus resources to help better the student's college education. Supporters also note the rising number of minority applications to colleges and universities due in part to affirmative action policies.<br/>Statistics have proven that when affirmative action is eliminated, such as when it was at Berkley College and UCLA in 1998, the minority student admissions fell 61 percent and 36 percent respectively, proving that affirmative action plays a major role in a minority students college admissions process. Affirmative action supporters also believe that diversity in higher education provides a better educational atmosphere for all students, personally and intellectually. If affirmative action were to be eliminated, there would be fewer minority students enrolled in colleges, causing diversity to be fairly slim. Affirmative action policies are also necessary in order to compensate for centuries of racial, economic, and social oppression. Individuals with a higher socioeconomic status have more opportunities than those of lower socioeconomic backgrounds. Supporters believe that certain racial or ethnic groups are disadvantaged because they are frequently in lower income households and consequently are not exposed to the same resources as students from higher socioeconomic classes. Advocates support the notion of competition between students based on merit, but argue that affirmative action compensates for economic differences. College graduates, who have benefitted from affirmative action, have also said that they received better jobs, earned more money, and overall live better lives because of the fortunate opportunities they received through affirmative action.<br/>Supporters of affirmative action continuously stress the severe importance of affirmative action, considering its contributions to enhancing both the college experience and society in general. However, opponents of affirmative action believe that the time has come to end affirmative action. Opponents believe affirmative action was created to ensure fair admission practices to bring change to a long period of racial discrimination. They believe the policy is outdated."It's time to pull the plug on race-based decision making," says Ward Connerly, a Sacramento, California businessman and lead organizer of...<br/><br/>Find Another Essay On The Precedency<br/><br/>754 words - 4 pages<br/>of the burden to continue prospering.

A acción afirmativa é o resultado do movemento dos Dereitos Civís da década de 1960, crecendo a partir da Lei de Dereitos Civís de 1964 que prohibiu a discriminación baseada na raza, etnia ou xénero. Foi a decisión da Corte Suprema de 1978, The Regents of the University of California v.

Os partidarios da acción afirmativa fan moitos argumentos en apoio da acción afirmativa, coa esperanza de conseguir que outros vexan o verdadeiro ben que as políticas de acción afirmativa traen á nosa sociedade. Os partidarios cren que a acción afirmativa é máis un proceso que unha política de admisión. Os colexios e universidades toman a iniciativa extra para chegar aos grupos minoritarios, animándoos a aplicar. Colexios e universidades ofrecen axuda financeira adicional e proporcionan recursos no campus para axudar a mellorar a educación universitaria do estudante. Os partidarios tamén observan o crecente número de solicitudes minoritarias a colexios e universidades debido en parte ás políticas de acción afirmativa.<br/>As estatísticas demostraron que cando se elimina a acción afirmativa, como cando estaba en Berkley College e UCLA en 1998, as admisións de estudantes minoritarios caeron 61 por cento e 36 por cento respectivamente, demostrando que a acción afirmativa xoga un papel importante nun proceso de admisión de estudantes universitarios minoritarios. Os defensores da acción afirmativa tamén cren que a diversidade na educación superior proporciona un mellor ambiente educativo para todos os estudantes, persoal e intelectualmente. Se a acción afirmativa fose eliminada, habería menos estudantes de minorías matriculados nas universidades, causando que a diversidade fose bastante delgada. As políticas de acción afirmativa tamén son necesarias para compensar séculos de opresión racial, económica e social. As persoas con un status socioeconómico máis alto teñen máis oportunidades que as de antecedentes socioeconómicos máis baixos. Os defensores cren que certos grupos raciais ou étnicos están desfavorecidos porque están frecuentemente en fogares de ingresos máis baixos e, en consecuencia, non están expostos aos mesmos recursos que os estudantes de clases socioeconómicas máis altas. Os avogados apoian a noción de competencia entre estudantes baseada no mérito, pero argumentan que a acción afirmativa compensa as diferenzas económicas. Os graduados universitarios, que se beneficiaron da acción afirmativa, tamén dixeron que recibiron mellores empregos, gañaron máis diñeiro e, en xeral, viven mellores vidas debido ás oportunidades afortunadas que recibiron a través da acción afirmativa.<br/>Os defensores da acción afirmativa enfatizan continuamente a grave importancia da acción afirmativa, considerando as súas contribucións para mellorar tanto a experiencia universitaria como a sociedade en xeral. Con todo, os opositores da acción afirmativa cren que chegou o momento de poñer fin á acción afirmativa. Os opositores cren que a acción afirmativa creouse para garantir prácticas de admisión xustas para traer o cambio a un longo período de discriminación racial.

| Combinations<br/><br/>Combinations Are defenses against a punch, choreographed responses to different types of attacks. They have many names across the martial arts but (in my experience) every art has a version of them. This makes them different than forms because there are plenty of martial arts that have no forms. What makes there partner exercises so universal? Why practice a specific response when (in reality) timing, type of attack, size of the attacker, and a hundred other factors will make it so you never use that entire choreographed response? And finally, how can we practice for a real defense situation and avoid injury at the same time?<br/><br/>The universality of combinations is impressive, to say the least. Our style of Kenpo karate has a list of 108 combos that can be learned. (Most students only learn 20-30 though) In Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu you spend whole classes practicing arm bars and chokes, learning every subtlety to the move while your partner offers little to no resistance. Every boxer has spent hours in front of the bag and/or mirror throwing the same combination of punches until their body moves by reflex alone. Combinations are universal because we have no better way to introduce movement and then practice the subtle positions required to make them work. Hitting a small pressure point through clothing takes A LOT of practice, catching an arm bar with control requires a carefully placed hip and a sneaky setup, and a great combination is only useful if you can through it from a balanced and protected position. Can you think of a better way to gain these skills?<br/><br/>There is any number of factors that determine how you respond to an attack and whether in a sparring match or in a fight, I have NEVER used a full combination in my defense. Why, then, do we spend hours practicing them? We practice these choreographed responses because the objective is not to pull combination 8 out every time you see a hook punch but to show you one way of blocking it and then a possible way to follow it up. I have never chosen to use combination 3 in a reality situation but the block is one of my go-to moves. Combinations add tools to the toolbox they do not fix the car.<br/><br/>The last question is a question of safety. If we practice for the sake of reality we need to replicate reality. How do we prevent injury while doing so? When it comes down to it, it's about building trust. We start slow and learn to trust that we have control over ourselves. We learn to trust our partners have control as well. In more time we learn to trust our control over our partner and (a little scarier) we learn to trust our partner's control over us. In the end (with a lot of practice) you can move are full speed, tossing your partner, and being thrown without fear of injury.<br/><br/>Combinations are universal for a reason; they are practiced so they can be dissected into their parts, and we stay safe by starting slow and building trust. As with everything else in the martial arts, combinations have many reasons behind their practice and execution. | Combinacións<br/><br/>As combinacións son defensas contra un golpe, respostas coreografadas a diferentes tipos de ataques. Teñen moitos nomes en todas as artes marciais pero (na miña experiencia) cada arte ten unha versión deles. Isto fai que sexan diferentes ás formas porque hai moitas artes marciais que non teñen formas. Que fai que os exercicios dos compañeiros sexan tan universais? Por que practicar unha resposta específica cando (en realidade) o tempo, o tipo de ataque, o tamaño do atacante e outros cen factores o farán para que nunca uses esa resposta coreografada enteira? E, finalmente, como podemos practicar para unha situación de defensa real e evitar lesións ao mesmo tempo?<br/><br/>A universalidade das combinacións é impresionante, polo menos. O noso estilo de kárate Kenpo ten unha lista de 108 combos que se poden aprender. (A maioría dos estudantes só aprenden 20-30 aínda) No Jiu-Jitsu brasileiro pasa clases enteiras practicando barras de brazo e asfixia, aprendendo cada sutileza para o movemento mentres o seu compañeiro ofrece pouca ou ningunha resistencia. Cada boxeador pasou horas diante da bolsa e / ou espello lanzando a mesma combinación de golpes ata que o seu corpo se move por reflexo só. As combinacións son universais porque non temos mellor forma de introducir o movemento e despois practicar as posicións sutís necesarias para facelas funcionar. Golpear un pequeno punto de presión a través da roupa require moita práctica, coller unha barra de brazos con control require unha cadea coidadosamente colocada e unha configuración furtiva, e unha gran combinación só é útil se pode atravesala desde unha posición equilibrada e protexida. Podes pensar nunha mellor forma de adquirir estas habilidades?<br/><br/>Hai unha serie de factores que determinan como respondes a un ataque e se nun combate ou nunha loita, NUNCA usei unha combinación completa na miña defensa. Por que, entón, pasamos horas practicándoos? Practicamos estas respostas coreografadas porque o obxectivo non é sacar a combinación 8 cada vez que ves un golpe de gancho, senón mostrarche unha forma de bloquealo e logo unha posible forma de seguilo. Nunca escollín usar a combinación 3 nunha situación de realidade, pero o bloque é un dos meus movementos. As combinacións engaden ferramentas á caixa de ferramentas que non fixan o coche.<br/><br/>A última pregunta é unha cuestión de seguridade. Se practicamos polo ben da realidade, necesitamos replicar a realidade. Como podemos evitar feridas mentres o facemos? Cando se trata de construír confianza. Comezamos lentamente e aprendemos a confiar que temos control sobre nós mesmos. Aprendemos a confiar que os nosos socios tamén teñen control. Con máis tempo aprendemos a confiar no noso control sobre o noso compañeiro e (un pouco máis asustado) aprendemos a confiar no control do noso compañeiro sobre nós. Ao final (con moita práctica) pode moverse a toda velocidade, lanzando o seu compañeiro, e ser lanzado sen medo a lesións.<br/><br/>As combinacións son universais por unha razón; practícanse para que poidan ser diseccionadas nas súas partes, e permanecemos seguros comezando lentamente e construíndo confianza. Como con todo o demais nas artes marciais, as combinacións teñen moitas razóns detrás da súa práctica e execución. |
