| Smith Chuck - Through the Bible C2000 SeriesShall we turn to the book of Acts, chapter one, as we begin our study of the early church.<br/>Luke, the author of the book of Acts, a companion of Paul the apostle, who was author also of the Gospel According to Luke, wrote these two treatises to a friend, Theophilus. Theophilus is a Greek name. It's a name that has a beautiful meaning. The name means lover of God. There are some who believe that it was not a man at all, but that the gospel and the book of Acts were addressed to the lovers of God, whoever you may be. There are other traditions that say that Theophilus was actually Luke's master. That in those days physicians were slaves, usually the slave of a wealthy patron. So that Luke's master was Theophilus, and he released Luke to be with Paul on the missionary journeys. Thus, Luke is writing back to his former master. This is an early tradition of the church, but it is, of course, impossible to prove, like so many of the traditions.<br/>There are also those who believe that when Paul was in Troas and he received a vision of a man calling unto him saying, "Come over to Macedonia and help us," that that man in Paul's vision was none other than Luke. For the first one that Paul really met when he came to Macedonia was Luke. And as we are in the book of Acts, you will find that when we get to that portion of the book of Acts, Luke begins to write more in the first person rather than the third person. So it is, evidently, at this particular point in the Acts of the Apostles that Luke became a companion of Paul and began to journey with him. He began to use the pronouns "we" and "us" instead of "they" and "them." This is, no doubt, where Luke became a participant and an eyewitness of those things that were happening from this point on. We will bring this out to you when we get to that point.<br/>He begins the Acts of the Apostles by tying it with the Gospel According to Luke. It is interesting that the very last thing that Luke records in his gospel is the very first thing he records in the Acts of the Apostles. We find the gospel of Luke closing as Jesus is telling His disciples to wait in Jerusalem until they be endued with power from on high. And then Jesus ascended up into heaven, and so he closes the gospel. In opening the Acts of the Apostles, he writes,<br/>The former treatise [that is, the Gospel According to Luke,] have I written unto you, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and teach ( Act 1:1 ),<br/>The key word is began. The Gospel According to Luke is not the full story of the ministry of Jesus Christ. It is only the beginning of the ministry of Jesus Christ. Jesus continues to minister to the needs of people. Jesus continues to heal the sick. Jesus continues to raise the dead. Jesus continues to minister His love and His gospel to the world, only now He is ministering through those disciples who have been anointed with His Holy Spirit. But the ministry of Christ is continuing; basically, is the premise that Luke takes in the Acts of the Apostles. The former treatise of all that Jesus began, both to do and to teach.<br/>Now because of that, the Acts of the Apostles is an unfinished book: in that the Lord today continues to work through the lives of those who have dedicated themselves to be the instruments of God. To be led and guided and anointed by His Holy Spirit, to continue the ministry of Jesus in the world today. Now God has ordained that His work should be accomplished through human instruments. I do not say that it must be accomplished. God can use angelic beings for His work, and there will come a time, during the book of Revelation when God will use angels to proclaim His gospel to people all over the world. Revelation, chapter 14, "The first angel flying through the midst of heaven having the everlasting gospel" ( Rev 14:6 ). But at the present time, God has chosen to use human instruments. As imperfect as they may be, yet that's what God has ordained to use. The exciting thing about that is, God will use me and God will use you. So many times, we're begging off, "O Lord, I can't speak. I've never been able to speak before or even now, Lord." As Moses tried to beg off the call of God. Jeremiah said, "Lord, I'm just a kid; no one's going to listen to me." And we all have our excuses why we can't be used. Don't we? We all know the reasons why God couldn't use us.<br/>One time, as the Lord was calling a prophet to do His work, he said, "Lord, send whoever you want." The Lord said, "Hey, I've called you." "Lord, good idea; send whoever you want." So often we're in that position, "Lord, send by the hand of whomsoever you will, anybody but me Lord." And yet, God has ordained to use us.<br/>Now, each of us can show our own imperfections. Each of us can point out our own inabilities, and all of us can find an excuse why God wouldn't want to use me. But yet, God has chosen to use you. That through your life He might reveal Himself to a needy world. You wonder when God has such instruments to use how He ever got the job done, don't you?<br/>Until the day in which he was taken up, after that he through the Holy Spirit had given commandments to the apostles whom he had chosen ( Act 1:2 ):<br/>That is what he ended the Gospel of Luke with. The day that Jesus was taken up, after He had told the apostles to wait for the endowment of power.<br/>To whom he also [that is the apostles he also] showed himself alive to them after his passion [or death] by many infallible proofs ( Act 1:3 ),<br/>It is difficult to deny the fact of the resurrection of Jesus Christ. I was amused, as well as annoyed and irritated, by an article I read in the Santa Ana Register this last Saturday. Of the creation science and evolutionary theories being presented in the county schools. How that, this one professor said that he teaches a science class, and thus, they deal only in facts, and that they don't have any place for theories. Because science is based upon fact and creation is based upon religious superstitions. It takes a lot of faith to believe the religious theories. When you are dealing with facts, you can just accept them. I thought, "Very interesting in that science class, they taught me it was a fact that the world was four billion years old. Now today they are teaching it's a fact that the world is twelve billion years old. And it wasn't that long ago that I went to school."<br/>It's interesting that the Bible has never needed to be revised or updated to meet the current data that men have discovered. And yet, if you would take my high school science textbooks today and try to teach a science class from them, you would find that many of the things that were taught as scientific fact when I was in high school are no longer recognized as scientific fact. The simple cell protoplasm is no longer a simple cell, but extremely complex. If there is any fact that can be attested to in history it is the fact of the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.<br/>We have a jurisprudence system that is based upon the testimony of witnesses. If a man is accused of a crime and there are people who witnessed that crime while it was being committed, and they are brought to the standard, and they swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help them God. And in their questioning they affirm that, "I saw that man in the bank on May twenty-third. I saw him pull out a gun from his coat. I heard him demand that all of the money be given to him. I saw him as he left the bank. I saw him as the officer apprehended him outside." And if you can get three or four witnesses to point to that man and will keep their testimony under cross-examination, that man is judged to be guilty. He is the one who did it. We have two or three witnesses that are testifying the same story about that man, and it is accepted as fact that he is the one who perpetrated the crime and is guilty. You've got witnesses who have sworn to tell the truth that are verifying.<br/>After the death of Jesus, when He rose again, He appeared unto many different people who gave sworn testimony that they saw Him. That they talked to Him, that He appeared to them in various places under different circumstances. And for a period of forty days was visiting with them. And at one time, up to as many as five hundred people who were gathered at one place, He appeared. It's difficult to just cast aside or deny the witness of these people. To do so is to discredit our whole jurisprudence system. But not only that, these men who testified that they saw the risen Lord, that they talked to Him, that they ate with Him, they, all of them, with the exception of one, met violent deaths at the hands of other people because of their affirming that the story they told was true. You talk about witnesses sworn to tell the truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth. If a person's life was threatened because of that witness, and it was a lie, at least one them would've broken under the pressure. They would've confessed to the entire hoax. "He showed Himself alive after His passion by many infallible proofs."<br/>being seen of them for forty days, speaking to them of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God ( Act 1:3 ):<br/>Sometimes we fault the disciples because of their questions of the timing of the kingdom of God. Let it be remembered that the kingdom of God was the favorite subject of Jesus Christ. He was always talking about the kingdom of God, and it is a great hope that He was planting into the hearts of all men. Things are not always going to continue corrupted as they are. The world is not going to go forever under the power of darkness, under the bondage of evil. God is going to one day establish His kingdom upon the earth. A kingdom of righteous joy and peace. "Jesus shall reign, where ere the sun doth her successive journeys run. And His kingdom will extend from shore to shore." And that day will be the most glorious day the world has ever seen, as sickness and suffering and pain will be abolished in His kingdom. As sin and greed and these things that have made the world such an intolerable place will be abolished in His kingdom. The godless commercialism, the exploitation of man, all of these things abolished in His glorious kingdom when He reigns. No wonder the disciples were anxious to get it on. I'm anxious to get it on; I'm anxious for His kingdom to come. And Jesus told us when we pray, the first petition is, "Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven" ( Mat 6:10 ). This is the right kind of a desire that we should all have. I desire the kingdom of God. And so He was talking to them, during this forty-day period, of the kingdom.<br/>And, being assembled together with them, he commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which, saith he, you have heard of me ( Act 1:4 ).<br/>He said, "Now look, wait here in Jerusalem until you receive the promise of the Father." This promise that He is referring to is, no doubt, the promise in Joel where the Lord promised, "And it shall come to pass in the later days, saith the Lord, that I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and daughters will prophesy, and your young men shall dream dreams, your old men shall see visions: and upon my servants and my handmaidens shall I pour out my Spirit, saith the Lord" ( Joe 2:28-29 ). The promise of the Father: the day is going to come when God is going to pour out His Spirit upon all flesh, all of the believers. They will, each one, receive that dynamic from God.<br/>For John [He said,] truly baptized with water; but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now ( Act 1:5 ).<br/>The idea of baptism was that of emersion, the bapteedzo. John baptized with water, submerged the people in water, "you're going to be submerged in the Holy Spirit in not many days."<br/>Now when they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, will you at this time restore the kingdom to Israel? ( Act 1:6 )<br/>"When is it going to be, Lord? When's the time for this restoration?" And Jesus is talking to them now, not about the kingdom, but about the power that they're going to receive for service. And so He brushes aside their question.<br/>Saying unto them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father has put in his own power ( Act 1:7 ).<br/>"It's not for you to know." They lived constantly in the anticipation of the immediate setting up of the kingdom. During the entire lifetime of Jesus, they were expecting Him at any moment to go into the phone booth and come out as the savior of the world. Shazzam! Showing His power and overthrowing the governments of the world, establishing God's kingdom upon the earth. And they were waiting daily for this change to transpire. And whenever Jesus would talk about going to Jerusalem, being turned over into the hands of sinful man, and then being crucified, "Oh, oh no, Lord. No, no you don't understand the kingdom, Lord. Be that far from Thee." When Jesus died on the cross, they were all greatly disappointed.<br/>The two disciples on the road to Emmaus, so sad. "Hey, fellows. How come you're so sad as your walking along?" "What do you mean? You must be a stranger around here if you don't know the things that have been happening lately in Jerusalem." "What things?" "Oh, a fellow by the name of Jesus of Nazareth...oh man, it was mighty and powerful. The anointing of God was upon His life. We had hoped that in Him was the deliverance of Israel, but they crucified Him. We had hoped . . . now it's dead." Now He's risen, and He's saying, "In a few days, fellows, you're going to receive the promise of the Father." "Oh, what promise? The promise of the establishing of the kingdom?" You see, it was legitimate that they should ask. "Is this it Lord? Alright! Is this the time? Are you going to set up your kingdom now?" "No. It's not for you to know those times that the Father's appointed or that the Father has in His own power. But, you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you."<br/>Now here, the Greek preposition epi is used to signify a new relationship that they were to have with the Holy Spirit. In the Gospel According to John, chapter 14, as Jesus is there promising to send the Holy Spirit, He said, "I will not leave you comfortless. I will come to you, and I will pray the Father, and He will send to you another comforter, even the Spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth Him not neither knows Him, but you know Him for He dwells with you, and He shall be in you" ( Joh 14:17-18 ). Same Greek preposition as ours, only they spell it "en" instead of "in." Two-fold relationship there in John: He is with you, but He's going to be dwelling in you. But now Jesus said you're going to receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you. The Greek preposition epi, which is translated in different texts throughout the New Testament as "upon" or "over" or I like it, "overflows."<br/>In the seventh chapter of the gospel of John: "On the last day, the great day of the feast when Jesus stood there on the Temple Mount and cried to the people, 'If any man thirst let him come unto Me and drink: and he who drinks of the water that I give, out of his innermost being there will gush torrents of living water.'" John said, "This spake He of the Spirit, which was not yet given which they who believe on Him should receive" ( Joh 7:37-39 ). What did He speak of the Spirit? That it would be like a torrent of living water flowing out. I like, "When the Spirit overflows you," upon you, or over you, or overflows from you. So the three-fold relationship: He is with you prior to your conversion, He is the one who causes you to realize that you are a sinner, He is the one who points to Jesus Christ as the answer as He convinces the world of sin, of righteous, and of judgment. The moment you open your life and heart to Jesus Christ and invite Him to come in, the Holy Spirit comes and begins to indwell you. He shall be in you. "Know ye not that you are not your own, you have been bought with a price, therefore glorify God in your body and your spirit which are His. And know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit which is in you? Be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess, but be filled, or be ye being filled with the Spirit" ( 1Co 6:19-20 ,Eph 5:18 ). But now here's a third relationship. This is an empowering experience.<br/>You will receive [the dunamus] the dynamics, when the Holy Spirit has come [epi] upon you [or over you, or when there is that overflow from you]: and ye shall be witnesses unto me ( Act 1:8 )<br/>And so the dynamic, to be a witness for Jesus Christ. It is interesting that the word witness in Greek is the word martus from where we get our word martyr. And in Greek it does mean martyr. A witness is one who not only proclaims what he believes, he lives what he believes, he is what he believes, and he believes it so strongly, that if necessary, he'll die for what he believes. That's how strong is his belief. He's a martus. You can't stop him. He's not afraid to die for what he believes.<br/>You remember when Paul was on his way back to Jerusalem and Agabus came down from Caesarea and he took Paul's girdle and tied himself up and he said, "So is the man who owns this girdle to be bound when he gets to Jerusalem." And Paul's friends began to weep, saying, "Oh, Paul, don't go, don't go." And he said, "What do you mean by these tears? Do you think you're going to dissuade me? Do you think I'm worried about being bound? I'm ready to die." He was a martus. "I'm ready to die." Being put to death for your faith did not make you a martyr; because you were a martyr, you were put to death. Because you were a witness, because you believed it so strong. So, it did not make you a witness, it only proved what you were. You were a witness all along. If you hadn't been a martus, you would've never gone to your death. You would've recanted; you would've said, "Whoa, whoa, wait, wait. Hold on, let's change course here. I think that I may have made a mistake." Then you say, "Well, he wasn't a martus. Stealing a horse doesn't make you a horse thief; it only proves that you were. No one steals a horse unless he's a horse thief. So, stealing it doesn't make you a horse thief, it only proves that you were all along. Being martyred only proves what you were a witness, a martus. "And you will be witnesses." And isn't it interesting that most of them were martyred? "Witnesses unto Me."<br/>The witness was to be both in Jerusalem, and in all of Judea ( Act 1:8 ),<br/>The witness began right at home. The hardest place, isn't it? It's to start right at home in Jerusalem, and then the area around Jerusalem, the area of Judea. And then it was to spread up into Samaria. And then it was to go out into the uttermost parts of the world. And as we study the book of Acts, we will see this very progression. How the witness began in Jerusalem. We'll get that in the next chapter. And then we'll see how it began to spread through out Judea. And then Phillip went up into Samaria, and then finally Paul and Barnabas are called to go into the uttermost parts of the world. And so the witness spread through the anointing and the empowering of the Holy Spirit.<br/>Now when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight ( Act 1:9 ).<br/>This is the final promise made by Jesus to His disciples. This is it, the final words prior to His ascension. Of course, later He came and talked to Paul and others, but prior to His ascension, this is His final word. And upon this, when He had spoken these things, while they were watching Him, He was taken up and a cloud received Him out of their sight.<br/>And while they were looking steadfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, there were two men who stood by them in white apparel ( Act 1:10 );<br/>We assume they were angels.<br/>Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as you have seen him go into heaven ( Act 1:11 ).<br/>They saw Him as He ascended up into heaven and they will behold Him when He comes again. "Behold the Lord cometh with ten thousands of His saints, to execute judgement upon the earth" (Jud 1:14-15). And then, "Unto Him who loved us and gave Himself for us and who has made us unto our God, kings and priests who shall reign with Him upon the earth, behold the Lord cometh, and every eye shall see Him, and they also who pierced Him shall mourn" Rev 1:5-7 ). So the Lord's coming. Every eye shall see Him. The Jehovah Witnesses say that He is already come, but it was a secret coming. As it was only the disciples that saw Him go, it was only the disciples, of the Jehovah Witnesses, who saw Him return. But Jesus said, "If they say unto you, 'He has come in secret and has gone into a secret chamber don't believe it'" ( Mat 24:26 ). So you have to choose, to believe Jesus or them.<br/>"This same Jesus which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as you've seen Him go into heaven."<br/>Now there's a very interesting verse in II John, verse Act 1:7 , "For many deceivers are entered into the world who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh." That, unfortunately, is a poor translation of the Greek. For this participle is in the present tense and should be translated "is coming in the flesh." Those who would deny that Jesus Christ is coming in the flesh. What does John say of them? "They are a deceiver and an antichrist. Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward. For whosoever transgresses and abides not in the doctrine of Christ, has not God. He that abides in the doctrine of Christ, he has both the Father and the Son. And if there come any unto your door (on Saturday morning) and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, and neither bid him good-bye. For he that bids him good-bye is a partaker of his evil deeds" (2Jn 1:7-11). Ask them one question, "Is Jesus coming in the flesh?" Just ask them that question. And if they say no, just remember what John warned you and what John told you. "If any confess not that Jesus Christ is coming in the flesh." Do you remember when He was with the disciples and He said, "Give me something to eat"? He said, "You know, spirits don't eat; touch me. See? It's me." So, this same Jesus is coming again in the same manner in which they saw Him go into heaven. And I, for one, believe that that coming is very soon.<br/>Then retuned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a Sabbath's day journey [about two-thirds of a mile]. And when they were come in, they went up into an upper room, where there abode both Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, and Phillip, and Thomas, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon Zelotes, and Judas the brother of James. And these all continued in one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers ( Act 1:12-14 ).<br/>This is the last mention of Mary the mother of Jesus. At this point and from this point on, there is no further mention of her in the Acts of the Apostles or in the epistles. No mention of her death or of her miraculous ascension into heaven, without death. Nothing is mentioned in the scripture. It is silent.<br/>His brethren would be a reference probably to James and to Jude and to those other brothers who were sons of Joseph and Mary.<br/>The upper room--there are some who say that it is the same upper room in which Jesus had the Last Supper with His disciples. And yet, there are others who hold to this upper room being a room in the temple precincts where the early church met. Take your choice.<br/>And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples, and said, (the number of their names together were about one hundred and twenty,) men and brethren, this Scripture must needs have been fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit by the mouth of David spake before concerning Judas, which was a guide to those who took Jesus ( Act 1:15-16 ).<br/>Here again, Peter still his same impetuous self. They're waiting in prayer and supplication, and Peter stands up and says, "Fellows, there's a scripture that's gotta be fulfilled." And you know he's going to move ahead, "Let's get the program going; let's cast lots and find out who's going to take Judas' place." I do feel that Peter was again in the flesh, manifesting that impetuous nature that was his. And I think that the future history of the church in the book of Acts points this out. I am interested in Peter's understanding of the scriptures, how that he is quoting from so many places in the Old Testament. Peter does manifest a very great understanding of the Old Testament scriptures which is a point in his favor.<br/>Notice that Peter ascribes to the Holy Spirit those things that David wrote. So that, "All scripture is given by inspiration of God" ( 2Ti 3:16 ). Not part of the scriptures. Because, if you tell me that part of the scriptures are given by inspiration of God, then I must ask you, "What parts are by inspiration and what parts are not by inspiration?" And then you are then the authority who tells me what part I can believe and what part I can't believe. And the minute that God is no longer the authority but you're the authority, I'm in trouble. Beware of those who say, "Well, you can't believe all of the scriptures." The scriptures themselves say, "All scripture is given by inspiration of God." And here, Luke in writing of what Peter was saying, declares that David was actually the spokesman for the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit, by the mouth of David, spake concerning Judas.<br/>For he was numbered with us, [he was one of the twelve] he had obtained a part of this ministry. But now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity; and falling headlong ( Act 1:17-18 ),<br/>He purchased the field, the potter's field as Zachariah the eleventh chapter declares.<br/>and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all of his bowels gushed out ( Act 1:18 ).<br/>There are those who find a discrepancy in the scriptures, because in one of the gospels we are told that when Judas came back and tried to return the money, and they said, "Hey, it's your problem. We can't take it." And put it back in the temple treasury. "It's blood money." Then he threw it there on the floor of the temple and he went out and hung himself. Here Peter tells us that he fell headlong and just popped. And there are those who imagine a discrepancy. Very simple, he went up into the tree to hang himself, tied the rope around his neck and tied it to the limb and jumped. And the force of the fall either snapped the rope or his head, and he fell on down into the canyon and just as he said it here.<br/>It was known to all of the dwellers at Jerusalem; insomuch that the field is called in their tongue, Aceldama, that is to say, The field of blood. For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be desolate, and let no man dwell therein: and, His bishoprick let another take ( Act 1:19-20 ).<br/>Now in reality he's quoting from two different Psalms here. From Psa 69:25 ,he puts it together with Psa 109:8 . And putting the two together he finds these prophecies concerning Judas.<br/>Wherefore of these men ( Act 1:21 )<br/>Now here is where they are looking for someone to take Judas' place to be an apostle. Here are the qualifications they looked for in that time.<br/>Wherefore of these men which have companied with us all the time that the Lord Jesus when in and out among us ( Act 1:21 ),<br/>Now you remember there were many disciples, many disciples of which Jesus chose ten to be apostles. And the word apostle means "one who is sent out." Or chose twelve to be apostles, so He sent out the twelve. The number of human government. "We only have eleven. We need one to take Judas' place, but we need one who has been with us all the while from the beginning with Jesus."<br/>From the time he was baptized by John, until the day he was taken up from us, must one be ordained to be a witness [of what?] of His resurrection ( Act 1:22 ).<br/>So these were the requirements they were looking for. Someone who had been around the whole while. From the time of John's baptism to the ascension. And one who saw the risen Lord, and thus could bear fact of the resurrection, their testimony to the fact.<br/>Now Paul the apostle, later in asserting the fact that he was an apostle said, "Have I not seen the risen Christ?" Evidently that was one of the requirements of apostleship. Someone asked me, "Are there apostles today?" Well, I don't know. I don't think that there are in the same sense that they were in the New Testament. Surely there is none today who can bear witness to the resurrection as they did.<br/>They appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias. And they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord, which knowest the hearts of all men, show whether of these two that you have chosen ( Act 1:23-24 ),<br/>I think that we often make this mistake of giving the Lord two choices, both wrong. Limiting God, you see. We're so prone to do this. Obviously, Paul was God's choice. Peter was impetuous, and jumping the gun said, "Hey, we've got to do something, you know, gotta help God out. You know, one's missing and we've got to fill him in." And yet, "God, which one of these two do you want?" And giving God the two choices.<br/>That he may take part of this ministry and this apostleship, from which Judas by the transgression fell, that he might go to his own place. And so they gave forth their lots ( Act 1:25-26 );<br/>An interesting way by which they sought to determine the will of God. Let's throw dice, find out what God's will is here. It's interesting to me, the various ways that people have devised to discern the will of God. Now, in the Old Testament times they had an interesting way of coming to the priest, who would inquire of the Lord for them through the Urim and the Thummim, the "lights and perfections." Just what these Urim and Thummim were, we don't know. I'm sure they were not the colored glasses that Joseph Smith found with the Golden Tablets; the magic glasses, that when you put them on, you could suddenly read the hieroglyphic writing.<br/>There are those who say that the Urim and Thummim were actually a black and a white stone that was worn in a pouch on the chest of the priest. They would pray and ask the Lord a particular question. You remember that David was asking the Lord definite questions: "Lord, shall we go out against the Philistines?" The answer was, "No." So again, the next day, "Lord, shall we go out against the Philistines?" The answer was, "Yes." "When shall we go?" They would ask specific questions, and the Lord would direct them through the Urim and the Thummin. They say that the priest would pray, seek God, and then reach in and pull out one of the two stones. If it was the white stone, it was a yes answer. If it was a no, then it would be the black stone that he would pull out. Some even say we get the term blackballed from this Urim and Thummim. Actually, back in the original it is a no vote against a particular project or idea. Just what the Urim and Thummim were, we don't know. But during the Old Testament period, they did use a method of casting lots to determine the will of God.<br/>So here the disciples are picking up on the same thing as they are throwing the dice to see which of the two fellows that God had chosen to replace Judas Iscariot.<br/>the lot fell on Matthias; he was numbered with the eleven ( Act 1:26 ).<br/>Now who in the world is Matthias? No one ever heard of him before or since. It'll be interesting to meet Matthias and find out who he is and what he did. I think from the subsequent history, it's obvious to assume that God chose Paul as an apostle. Paul declares it himself. Now this is the last time we ever read of them seeking to discern the will of God by the casting of lots or by a chance kind of a thing.<br/>I know a fellow today, in seeking to discern the will of the Lord, will pray and ask the Lord a question. He'll have ten pennies in his pocket, and as he's praying, he'll take the pennies with his eyes closed and put them down on the table, and if they all come up heads, it's a yes. An interesting thing, every once in a while, they'll all come up heads, and that's pretty good odds. Yet, we don't find any pattern for this after the Holy Spirit was given. Once the Holy Spirit came upon the church, then the Holy Spirit began to speak to them and direct them. And the Holy Spirit said, "Separate unto me Paul and Barnabas for the ministry where I have called them" ( Act 13:2 ). And the Holy Spirit sent them forth. So we find the church more directly guided by the Holy Spirit. Once the Holy Spirit came, this throwing dice to find out the will of God was set aside.<br/>"<br/><br/>King James Version<br/><br/>This is the 1769 King James Version of the Holy Bible (also known as the Authorized Version). "Public Domain" | Smith Chuck - A través da Biblia C2000 SeriesDebemos volver ao libro de Actos, capítulo un, como comezamos o noso estudo da igrexa primitiva.<br/>Lucas, o autor do libro de Actos, un compañeiro de Paulo o apóstolo, que foi autor tamén do Evanxeo segundo Lucas, escribiu estes dous tratados a un amigo, Teófilo. Teófilo é un nome grego. É un nome que ten un fermoso significado. O nome significa amante de Deus. Hai algúns que cren que non era un home en absoluto, pero que o evanxeo eo libro de Actos foron dirixidos aos amantes de Deus, quen queira que sexa. Hai outras tradicións que din que Teófilo era realmente o amo de Lucas, que neses días os médicos eran escravos, xeralmente escravos dun patrón rico. Así que o mestre de Lucas era Teófilo, e el liberou a Lucas para estar con Paulo nas viaxes misioneiras. Así, Lucas está escribindo de volta ao seu antigo mestre. Esta é unha tradición primitiva da igrexa, pero é, por suposto, imposible de probar, como tantas das tradicións.<br/>Hai tamén os que cren que, cando Paulo estaba en Tróade, recibiu unha visión dun home que o chamaba dicindo: "Pasa a Macedonia e axúdanos", que ese home na visión de Paulo non era outro que Lucas. Porque o primeiro que Paulo realmente coñeceu cando chegou a Macedonia foi Lucas; e como estamos no libro dos Actos, atoparás que cando chegamos a esa parte do libro dos Actos, Lucas comeza a escribir máis na primeira persoa que na terceira. Así é, evidentemente, neste punto particular nos Feitos dos Apóstolos que Lucas se converteu nun compañeiro de Paulo e comezou a viaxar con el, comezando a usar os pronomes "nós" e "nós" en lugar de "eles" e "eles". Isto é, sen dúbida, onde Luke se converteu nun participante e unha testemuña ocular daquelas cousas que estaban a suceder a partir de agora. Traerémosvos isto cando cheguemos a ese punto.<br/>Comeza os Feitos dos Apóstolos asociándoo co Evanxeo segundo Lucas. É interesante que o último que Lucas rexistra no seu evanxeo é o primeiro que rexistra nos Feitos dos Apóstolos. Atopamos o evanxeo de Lucas pechando como Xesús está dicindo aos seus discípulos para esperar en Xerusalén ata que sexan revestidos de poder desde o alto. E entón Xesús subiu ao ceo, e así pecha o evanxeo. Ao abrir os Actos dos Apóstolos, escribe,<br/>O primeiro tratado escribín para ti, Teófilo, de todo o que Xesús comezou a facer e ensinar.<br/>A palabra clave comezou. O Evanxeo Segundo Lucas non é a historia completa do ministerio de Xesucristo. É só o comezo do ministerio de Xesucristo. Xesús continúa a ministrar ás necesidades da xente. Xesús continúa a curar os enfermos. Xesús continúa a ministrar o seu amor eo seu evanxeo ao mundo, só agora El está ministrando a través dos discípulos que foron unxidos co seu Espírito Santo. Pero o ministerio de Cristo continúa; basicamente, é a premisa que Lucas toma nos Actos dos Apóstolos. O primeiro tratado de todo o que Xesús comezou, tanto para facer como para ensinar.<br/>Agora, por iso, os Feitos dos Apóstolos é un libro inacabado: en que o Señor segue traballando hoxe a través da vida de quen se dedicou a ser instrumentos de Deus. Para ser guiado e guiado e unxido polo seu Espírito Santo, para continuar o ministerio de Xesús no mundo hoxe. Agora Deus ordenou que a súa obra debe ser realizada a través de instrumentos humanos. Eu non digo que debe ser realizada. Deus pode usar os seres anxos para a súa obra, e chegará un tempo, durante o libro do Apocalipse, cando Deus usará os anxos para proclamar o seu evanxeo á xente de todo o mundo. Apocalipse, capítulo 14, "O primeiro anxo que voa polo medio do ceo ten o evanxeo eterno" ( Apocalipse 14: 6 ). Pero na actualidade, Deus elixiu usar instrumentos humanos. Por imperfecto que sexan, aínda que iso é o que Deus ordenou usar. O emocionante diso é que Deus usará a min e Deus usarache a ti. Tantas veces, imploramos, "Oh Señor, non podo falar. Nunca antes nin agora, Señor." Como Moisés intentou implorar a chamada de Deus. Xeremías dixo: "Señor, son só un neno; ninguén me vai escoitar." E todos temos as nosas escusas para non sermos usados. Non é así? Todos sabemos as razóns polas que Deus non nos pode usar.<br/>Unha vez, cando o Señor estaba chamando un profeta para facer a súa obra, el dixo: "Señor, enviar a quen queiras." O Señor dixo: "Ei, chamei a ti." "Señor, boa idea, enviar a quen queiras." Tan a miúdo estamos nesa posición, "Señor, envía pola man de quen queiras, calquera, excepto eu, Señor." E con todo, Deus ordenou para usarnos.<br/>Agora, cada un de nós pode mostrar as súas propias imperfeccións. Cada un de nós pode sinalar as súas propias incapacidades, e todos nós podemos atopar unha escusa por que Deus non quere usarme. Pero aínda así, Deus escolleu usarte. Que a través da súa vida El podería revelarse a un mundo necesitado. Pregúntase cando Deus ten tales instrumentos para usar como El sempre fixo o traballo, non é?<br/>Ata o día en que foi levantado, despois de que, polo Espírito Santo, dera mandamentos aos apóstolos que el escollera.<br/>Iso é o que rematou o Evanxeo de Lucas con. O día que Xesús foi levado, despois de que dixera aos apóstolos que esperar para a dotación de poder.<br/>Aos que tamén se lles mostrou vivo despois da súa paixón con moitas probas infalibles.<br/>É difícil negar o feito da resurrección de Xesucristo. Fun divertido, así como molesto e irritado, por un artigo que lin no Rexistro de Santa Ana este pasado sábado. Das ciencias da creación e as teorías evolutivas que se presentan nas escolas do condado. Como iso, este profesor dixo que ensina unha clase de ciencias, e polo tanto, tratan só de feitos, e que non teñen lugar para as teorías. Porque a ciencia está baseada nos feitos e a creación está baseada nas supersticións relixiosas. É necesaria moita fe para crer nas teorías relixiosas. Cando se trata de feitos, só se poden aceptar. Pensei: "Moi interesante nesa clase de ciencias, ensináronme que era un feito que o mundo tiña 4.000 millóns de anos. Hoxe están ensinando que é un feito que o mundo ten 12.000 millóns de anos. E non foi hai moito tempo que fun á escola".<br/>É interesante que a Biblia nunca tivo que ser revisado ou actualizado para atender os datos actuais que os homes descubriron. E aínda así, se hoxe tomases os meus libros de ciencias do instituto e tratases de ensinar unha clase de ciencias con eles, descubrirías que moitas das cousas que se ensinaban como feito científico cando eu estaba no instituto xa non se recoñecen como feito científico. O protoplasma celular simple xa non é unha célula simple, senón extremadamente complexo. Se hai algún feito que se pode atestiguar na historia é o feito da resurrección de Xesucristo de entre os mortos.<br/>Temos un sistema de xurisprudencia que se basea no testemuño de testemuñas. Se un home é acusado dun crime e hai persoas que testemuñan ese crime mentres se estaba cometendo, e son levados ao estándar, e xuran dicir a verdade, toda a verdade, e nada máis que a verdade, entón axúdalles Deus. E no seu interrogatorio afirman que, "Eu vin que o home no banco o vinte e tres de maio. Eu vin que sacou unha arma do seu abrigo. Eu oín-lo esixir que todo o diñeiro sexa dado a el. Eu o vin mentres saía do banco. Eu vin como o oficial o prendeu fóra. "E se pode obter tres ou catro testemuñas para apuntar a ese home e manter o seu testemuño baixo interrogatorio, ese home é xulgado culpable. Temos dúas ou tres testemuñas que están testemuñando a mesma historia sobre ese home, e é aceptado como feito que é o que perpetrou o crime e é culpable.<br/>Despois da morte de Xesús, cando resucitou, apareceu a moitas persoas diferentes que testemuñan xurado que o viron. Que falaron con El, que se lles apareceu en varios lugares en diferentes circunstancias. E durante un período de corenta días estivo visitando con eles. E nunha ocasión, ata ata quinientas persoas que estaban reunidas nun só lugar, El apareceu. É difícil simplemente deixar de lado ou negar o testemuño desa xente. Desacreditar todo o noso sistema xurídico é desacreditar todo o noso sistema xurídico. Pero non só iso, estes homes que testemuñan que viron o Señor resucitado, que falaron con El, que comeron con El, todos eles, coa excepción dun, atoparon mortes violentas a mans doutras persoas por afirmar que a historia que contaron era verdade. Falas de testemuñas que xuraron dicir a verdade, toda a verdade, nada máis que a verdade. Se a vida dunha persoa fose ameazada por esa testemuña, e fose unha mentira, polo menos unha delas rompería baixo a presión. Confesarían todo o engano: "Mostrouse vivo despois da súa paixón por moitas probas infalibles".<br/>Durante corenta días, fálalles das cousas referentes ao Reino de Deus (Actos 1:3).<br/>Ás veces culpamos aos discípulos por mor das súas preguntas sobre o momento do reino de Deus. Que se lembre que o reino de Deus foi o tema favorito de Xesús Cristo. El estaba sempre falando sobre o reino de Deus, e é unha gran esperanza que El estaba plantando nos corazóns de todos os homes. As cousas non sempre van seguir corrompidos como son. O mundo non vai pasar para sempre baixo o poder das tebras, baixo a escravitude do mal. Deus vai establecer un día o seu reino sobre a terra. Un reino de xustiza alegría e paz. "Xesús reinará, onde antes do sol corren as súas sucesivas viaxes. E o seu reino estenderase de costa a costa." E aquel día será o día máis glorioso que o mundo xa viu, como enfermidade e sufrimento e dor serán abolidos no seu reino, como o pecado ea avaricia e estas cousas que fixeron o mundo un lugar tan intolerable será abolido no seu reino. O comercialismo sen deus, a explotación do home, todas estas cousas abolidas no seu reino glorioso cando reina. Non é de estrañar que os discípulos estaban ansiosos por conseguilo. Estou ansioso por conseguilo; Estou ansioso polo seu reino por vir. E Xesús díxonos cando oramos, a primeira petición é: "Venha o teu reino. Fágase a túa vontade na terra, así como no ceo" ( Mat 6:10 ). Este é o tipo correcto de desexo que todos deberíamos ter. Desexo o reino de Deus. E así lles falaba, durante este período de corenta días, do reino.<br/>E, xuntándose con eles, mandoulles que non se afastasen de Xerusalén, senón que agardasen a promesa do Pai, a cal, di el, oístes falar de min.<br/>E el dixo: "Agora, olla, espera aquí en Xerusalén, ata que recibades a promesa do Pai". Esta promesa á que se refire é, sen dúbida, a promesa en Joel onde o Señor prometeu: "E acontecerá nos últimos días, di o Señor, que derramarei o meu Espírito sobre toda carne; e os vosos fillos e fillas profetizarán, e os vosos mozos soñarán soños, os vosos anciáns verán visións; e sobre os meus servos e as miñas servas derramarei o meu Espírito". A promesa do Pai: Chegará o día en que Deus derramará o seu Espírito sobre toda a carne, todos os crentes, e cada un recibirá esa dinámica de Deus.<br/>Porque Xoán bautizou con auga, pero vós seredes bautizados co Espírito Santo dentro de non moitos días.<br/>A idea do bautismo era a de emersión, o bautismo. Xoán bautizou con auga, mergullou a xente en auga, "vades ser mergullados no Espírito Santo en non moitos días."<br/>6Cando se xuntaron, preguntáronlle: ‐"Señor, ¿restaurarás neste tempo o reino a Israel?"<br/>"Cando vai ser, Señor? Cando é o tempo para esta restauración?" E Xesús está a falar con eles agora, non sobre o reino, pero sobre o poder que van recibir para o servizo. E así El deixa de lado a súa pregunta.<br/>Non vos corresponde a vós coñecer os tempos ou as estacións que o Pai puxo no seu poder (Actos 1:7).<br/>"Non é para ti para saber." Eles vivían constantemente na anticipación do establecemento inmediato do reino. Durante toda a vida de Xesús, eles estaban esperando El en calquera momento para entrar na cabina telefónica e saír como o salvador do mundo. Shazzam! Mostrando o seu poder e derrocando os gobernos do mundo, establecendo o reino de Deus sobre a terra. E eles estaban agardando diariamente por este cambio para transpirar. E cada vez que Xesús falaba de ir a Xerusalén, ser entregado nas mans do pecador, e despois ser crucificado, "Oh, oh non, Señor. Non, non entendes o reino, Señor. Cando Xesús morreu na cruz, todos quedaron moi decepcionados.<br/>Os dous discípulos no camiño a Emaús, tan triste. "Ola, rapaces. Como é que está tan triste como camiñar xunto?" "O que quere dicir? Debe ser un estraño por aquí se non sabe as cousas que pasaron ultimamente en Xerusalén." "Que cousas?" "Oh, un home chamado Xesús de Nazaret ... oh home, era poderoso e poderoso. A unción de Deus estaba sobre a súa vida. Nós tiñamos a esperanza de que nel estaba a liberación de Israel, pero eles crucificárono. Nós tiñamos a esperanza . . . agora está morto ". Agora El resucitou, e está dicindo, "Dentro duns días, compañeiros, van recibir a promesa do Pai." "Oh, que promesa? A promesa do establecemento do reino?" Vedes, era lexítimo que preguntasen. "É isto Señor? Está ben! ¿É este o tempo? ¿Vais establecer o voso reino agora? ‐Non. Non vos corresponde a vós coñecer os tempos que o Pai fixou, nin os que o Pai ten no seu poder, senón que recibiredes poder cando veña sobre vós o Espírito Santo.<br/>Agora aquí, a preposición grega epi úsase para significar unha nova relación que ían ter co Espírito Santo. No Evanxeo segundo Xoán, capítulo 14, como Xesús está alí prometendo enviar o Espírito Santo, El dixo: "Non vos deixarei desconsolados. Eu virei a vós, e rogarei ao Pai, e el enviaravos outro Consolador, o Espírito da Verdade, que o mundo non pode recibir, porque non o ve nin o coñece; pero vós o coñecedes, porque está convosco e estará en vós” (Xn 14,17-18). A mesma preposición grega que a nosa, só que o deletrean "en" en lugar de "in". Relación dobre alí en Xoán: El está con vostede, pero vai estar habitando en vostede. Pero agora Xesús dixo que vai recibir poder cando o Espírito Santo vén sobre vostede. A preposición grega epi, que se traduce en diferentes textos ao longo do Novo Testamento como "sobre" ou "sobre" ou gústame, "desborda".<br/>No sétimo capítulo do evanxeo de Xoán: "No último día, o gran día da festa, cando Xesús estaba alí no monte do templo e berrou ao pobo, "Se alguén ten sede, que veña a min e beber; e quen bebe da auga que eu dou, alí, do seu íntimo, brotarán torrentes de auga viva ". Xoán dixo: "Isto falou do Espírito, que aínda non foi dado o que os que cren nel deben recibir" ( Xoán 7:37-39 ). Que falou do Espírito? Que sería como un torrente de auga viva que brota. A min gústame, cando o Espírito desborda sobre ti, ou sobre ti, ou sobre ti, ou desborda de ti. Entón, a relación tripla: El está con vostede antes da súa conversión, El é o que fai que vostede se decata de que é un pecador, El é o que apunta a Xesús Cristo como a resposta mentres convence o mundo do pecado, do xusto e do xuízo. No momento en que abres a túa vida e o teu corazón a Xesucristo e o convidas a entrar, vén o Espírito Santo e comeza a habitar en ti. ‐¿Non sabedes que non sodes vosos, senón que fostes comprados por un prezo? Glorificade, pois, a Deus no voso corpo e no voso espírito, que é o seu; e non sabedes que o voso corpo é templo do Espírito Santo que hai en vós? Non se embriague con viño, onde hai exceso, pero ser enche, ou ser cheo do Espírito "( 1Co 6,19-20 ,Ef 5,18 ). Pero agora aquí está unha terceira relación. Esta é unha experiencia de poder.<br/>Seredes testemuñas de min cando o Espírito Santo veña sobre vós (ou sobre vós), e seredes testemuñas miñas.<br/>E así a dinámica, ser testemuña de Xesucristo. É interesante que a palabra testemuña en grego é a palabra martus de onde obtemos a nosa palabra mártir. E en grego significa mártir. Unha testemuña é aquel que non só proclama o que cre, senón que vive o que cre, é o que cre, e o cre con tanta forza que, se é necesario, morrerá polo que cre. Non podes detelo, non ten medo de morrer polo que cre.<br/>Lembrades cando Paulo estaba de camiño de volta a Xerusalén e Agabo baixou de Cesarea e colleu o cinto de Paulo e atouse a si mesmo e dixo: "Así é o home que posúe este cinto para ser atado cando chega a Xerusalén". E os amigos de Paul comezaron a chorar, dicindo: "Oh, Paul, non vaias, non vaias." E el dixo: "Que queres dicir con estas bágoas? Cres que vas disuadirme? Cres que me preocupa estar atado? Estou listo para morrer." Era un martus. ‐Estou a punto de morrer. O feito de morrer pola túa fe non te fixo mártir; porque eras mártir, fuches condenado a morte; porque eras testemuña, porque o crebas con tanta forza. Así que non te converteu nunha testemuña, só demostrou o que eras. Foches testemuña todo o tempo. Se non foses un martus, nunca terías ido á túa morte. Terías retractado; dirías, "Whoa, whoa, espera, espera. Agarde, cambiemos de rumbo aquí. Creo que cometín un erro. Entón dicides: "Ben, non era un martus. Roubar un cabalo non fai de ti un ladrón de cabalos; só proba que o eras. Ninguén rouba un cabalo a menos que sexa un ladrón de cabalos. Entón, roubar non fai de ti un ladrón de cabalos, só proba que estivo sempre. Ser martirizado só proba o que eras unha testemuña, un martus. "E seredes testemuñas". E non é interesante que a maioría deles foron martirizados? "Testemuñas para min".<br/>A testemuña debía estar en Xerusalén e en toda Xudea (Actos 1:8).<br/>A testemuña comezou na casa. O lugar máis difícil, non é? É comezar na casa en Xerusalén, e despois a área arredor de Xerusalén, a área de Xudea. E despois foi para espallarse en Samaría. E entón foi para saír aos extremos do mundo. E mentres estudamos o libro de Feitos, veremos esta progresión. Como comezou o testemuño en Xerusalén. Imos entendelo no seguinte capítulo. E entón imos ver como empezou a estenderse por toda Xudea. E entón Filipe subiu a Samaria, e entón finalmente Paulo e Bernabé son chamados a ir aos extremos do mundo. E así o testemuño espallouse a través da unción e o poder do Espírito Santo.<br/>E cando dixo estas cousas, mentres eles miraban, foi levado para arriba, e unha nube recibiuno fóra da súa vista (Act 1, 9).<br/>Esta é a promesa final feita por Xesús aos seus discípulos. Esta é, as últimas palabras antes da súa ascensión. Por suposto, máis tarde veu e falou con Paulo e outros, pero antes da súa ascensión, esta é a súa última palabra. E cando dixo estas cousas, mentres eles o vixían, foi levado e unha nube recibiuno fóra da súa vista.<br/>E mentres eles miraban fixamente cara ao ceo, mentres subía, velaquí, había dous homes que estaban xunto a eles en roupa branca (Act 1, 10).<br/>Supoño que eran anxos.<br/>‐Homes de Galilea, ¿por que estades mirando cara ao ceo? Este Xesús, que foi levado de vós cara ao ceo, virá do mesmo xeito que o vistes ir cara ao ceo.<br/>Eles o viron como subiu ao ceo e verán que cando volva, "Velaquí que o Señor vén con dez mil dos seus santos, para executar o xuízo sobre a terra" (Xoán 1:14-15). E entón: "A aquel que nos amou e se entregou a si mesmo por nós e que nos fixo para o noso Deus, reis e sacerdotes que reinarán con el na terra, velaquí, o Señor vén, e todo ollo o verá, e tamén os que o traspasaron chorarán" (Apocalipse 1:5-7). Así que o Señor vén. Todos os ollos o verán. As testemuñas de Xehová din que xa veu, pero foi un segredo vindo. Como foron só os discípulos que o viron ir, foron só os discípulos, das testemuñas de Xehová, que o viron volver. Pero Xesús díxolles: "Se vos din: 'El veu en segredo e entrou nunha cámara secreta, non o creades'" (Mateo 24:26 ). Polo tanto, tedes que escoller, para crer en Xesús ou neles.<br/>"Este mesmo Xesús, que foi levado de vós para o ceo, virá do mesmo xeito que o viches ir para o ceo."<br/>Agora hai un verso moi interesante en II Xoán, versículo Act 1:7, "Pois moitos enganadores entraron no mundo que non confesan que Xesucristo veu en carne." Que, por desgraza, é unha mala tradución do grego. Porque este participio está no tempo presente e debe ser traducido como "ven na carne." Os que negan que Xesús Cristo está vindo na carne. Que di Xoán deles? "Eles son un enganador e un anticristo. Coidado con vós mesmos, para que non perdamos o que fixemos, senón que recibamos unha recompensa completa; porque quen se rebela e non permanece na doutrina de Cristo, non ten Deus. Quen permanece na doutrina de Cristo, ten tanto o Pai como o Fillo; e se alguén chega á túa porta e non trae esta doutrina, non o recibas na túa casa nin o despídase. Porque quen lle di adeus é un participante das súas malas obras" (2 Xoán 1:7-11). Pregúntalles unha pregunta: "É Xesús que vén na carne?" Pregúntalles esa pregunta. E se eles din que non, lembren o que Xoán vos advertiu e o que Xoán vos dixo. "Se alguén non confesa que Xesucristo está a vir en carne." Lembras cando estaba cos discípulos e el dixo, "Dáme algo para comer?" El dixo, "Sabes, os espíritos non comen; tócame. Mira? Son eu." Así, este mesmo Xesús volve, do mesmo xeito que o viron ir para o ceo. E eu, por un lado, creo que a vinda é moi pronto.<br/>Entón volveron a Xerusalén desde o monte chamado das Oliveiras, que é de Xerusalén un día de viaxe de sábado. Cando entraron, subiron a un cuarto alto, onde vivían Pedro, Santiago, Xoán, Andrés, Filipe, Tomás, Bartolomé, Mateo, Santiago, fillo de Alfeo, Simón o Zelote e Xudas, irmán de Santiago. E todos eles seguían unánimes en oración e súplica, coas mulleres, e María, a nai de Xesús, e cos seus irmáns (Act 1, 12-14).<br/>Esta é a última mención de María, a nai de Xesús. Neste punto e a partir de agora, non hai máis mención dela nos Actos dos Apóstolos ou nas epístolas. Non hai mención da súa morte ou da súa milagrosa ascensión ao ceo, sen morte. Non se menciona nada nas Escrituras. Está en silencio.<br/>Os seus irmáns serían unha referencia probablemente a Santiago e a Xudas e a aqueles outros irmáns que eran fillos de Xosé e María.<br/>O cuarto superior - hai algúns que din que é o mesmo cuarto superior no que Xesús tivo a Última Cea cos seus discípulos. E, con todo, hai outros que sosteñen que este cuarto superior é un cuarto nos recintos do templo onde se reuniu a igrexa primitiva. Fai a túa escolla.<br/>Naqueles días, Pedro ergueuse no medio dos discípulos, e dixo, (o número dos seus nomes eran uns cento vinte,) homes e irmáns, esta Escritura debeu cumprirse, que o Espírito Santo por boca de David falou antes sobre Xudas, que era un guía para os que levaron a Xesús (Feitos 1:15-16).<br/>Aquí de novo, Pedro aínda o seu mesmo eu impetuoso. Eles están esperando en oración e súplica, e Pedro se ergue e di, "Compañeiros, hai unha escritura que ten que ser cumprido." E sabedes que vai seguir adiante, "Imos facer o programa, botemos por sorteo e descubramos quen vai ocupar o lugar de Xudas". Sinto que Pedro estaba de novo na carne, manifestando esa natureza impetuosa que era a súa. E eu creo que a historia futura da igrexa no libro de Feitos apunta isto. Estou interesado na comprensión de Pedro das escrituras, como que está citando de tantos lugares no Antigo Testamento. Pedro manifesta unha gran comprensión das escrituras do Antigo Testamento que é un punto ao seu favor.<br/>Nótese que Pedro atribúe ao Espírito Santo as cousas que David escribiu. De xeito que, "Toda a Escritura é dada por inspiración de Deus" (2Ti 3:16). Non parte das Escrituras. Porque, se me dis que parte das escrituras son dadas por inspiración de Deus, entón teño que preguntarche: "Que partes son por inspiración e que partes non son por inspiración?" E entón vostede é a autoridade que me di que parte podo crer e que parte non podo crer. E no momento en que Deus xa non é a autoridade, pero vostede é a autoridade, estou en apuros. Coidado cos que din: "Ben, non podes crer en todas as Escrituras." As propias Escrituras din: "Toda Escritura é dada por inspiración de Deus." E aquí, Lucas escribindo o que Pedro estaba a dicir, declara que David era realmente o portavoz do Espírito Santo. O Espírito Santo, por boca de David, falou sobre Xudas.<br/>Porque el foi contado con nós, [era un dos doce] el tiña obtido unha parte deste ministerio. Pero agora este home comprou un campo coa recompensa da iniquidade; e caendo de cabeza (Act 1,17-18),<br/>El comprou o campo, o campo do oleiro, como declara Zacarías o capítulo undécimo.<br/>E caendo de cabeza, rompeu no medio, e todos os seus intestinos brotaron (Actos 1:18).<br/>Hai quen atopa unha discrepancia nas escrituras, porque nun dos evanxeos dinnos que cando Xudas volveu e tratou de devolver o diñeiro, e dixeron: "Ei, é o teu problema. Non podemos aceptalo". E volveuno poñer no tesouro do templo. "É diñeiro de sangue." Entón el botou alí no chan do templo e el saíu e se aforcou. Aquí Pedro dinos que caeu de cabeza e acaba de estoupar. E hai algúns que imaxinan unha discrepancia. Moi sinxelo, subiu á árbore para colgarse, amarrou a corda ao redor do pescozo e amarrouno ao membro e saltou. E a forza da caída rompeu a corda ou a súa cabeza, e caeu no canón e exactamente como dixo aquí.<br/>Todos os habitantes de Xerusalén o coñecían, de tal xeito que o campo se chama na súa lingua Aceldama, é dicir, Campo de Sangue. Porque está escrito no libro dos Salmos: Que a súa morada sexa desolada, e que ninguén habite nela; e que o seu bispado tome outro (Actos 1:19-20).<br/>Agora, en realidade, está a citar dous Salmos diferentes aquí. De Salmo 69:25 , el pon-lo xunto con Salmo 109:8 . E poñendo os dous xuntos atopa estas profecías sobre Xudas.<br/>Polo tanto, estes homes ( Actos 1: 21 )<br/>Aquí é onde buscan a alguén que tome o lugar de Xudas para ser un apóstolo. Aquí están as cualificacións que buscaban nese tempo.<br/>Por iso, entre estes homes que estiveron connosco todo o tempo que o Señor Xesús entrou e saíu entre nós,<br/>Agora, lembrar que había moitos discípulos, moitos dos cales Xesús escolleu dez para ser apóstolos. E a palabra apóstolo significa "aquel que é enviado." Ou escolleu doce para ser apóstolos, polo que enviou os doce. O número do goberno humano. ‐Só temos once; necesitamos un que ocupe o lugar de Xudas, pero necesitamos un que estea connosco desde o principio con Xesús.<br/>Desde o momento en que foi bautizado por Xoán, ata o día en que foi arrebatado de entre nós, debe ser ordenado para ser testemuña da súa resurrección.<br/>Así que estes eran os requisitos que estaban buscando. Alguén que estivera ao redor de todo o tempo. Desde o tempo do bautismo de Xoán ata a ascensión. E un que viu o Señor resucitado, e así podía soportar o feito da resurrección, o seu testemuño do feito.<br/>Agora Paulo, o apóstolo, máis tarde en afirmar o feito de que el era un apóstolo dixo: "Eu non vin o Cristo resucitado?" Evidentemente que era un dos requisitos do apostolado. Alguén me preguntou, "Hai apóstolos hoxe?" Ben, eu non sei. Non creo que haxa no mesmo sentido que estaban no Novo Testamento. Seguramente non hai hoxe ninguén que poida testemuñar a resurrección como eles o fixeron.<br/>E nomearon dous, Xosé chamado Barsabás, que se chamaba Xusto, e Matías; e eles oraron, dicindo: Ti, Señor, que coñeces os corazóns de todos os homes, mostra se destes dous escolleu,<br/>Creo que a miúdo cometemos este erro de dar ao Señor dúas opcións, ambas erradas. Limitar a Deus, ves. Somos tan propensos a facer isto. Obviamente, Paulo foi a elección de Deus. Peter foi impetuoso, e saltando a arma dixo, "Ei, temos que facer algo, xa sabes, temos que axudar a Deus. Sabes, falta un e temos que enchelo." E aínda así, "Deus, cal destes dous queres?" E dando a Deus as dúas opcións.<br/>Para que poida tomar parte neste ministerio e este apostolado, do cal Judas pola transgresión caeu, para que poida ir ao seu propio lugar. E así entregaron as súas sortes (Act 1: 25-26 );<br/>Unha forma interesante pola que trataron de determinar a vontade de Deus. Lancemos dados, descubramos cal é a vontade de Deus aquí. É interesante para min, as diversas formas que a xente ideou para discernir a vontade de Deus. Agora, nos tempos do Antigo Testamento tiñan unha forma interesante de chegar ao sacerdote, quen lles preguntaría ao Señor por eles a través do Urim e o Tumim, as "luzes e perfeccións". Exactamente o que eran estes Urim e Tumim, non sabemos. Estou seguro de que non eran as gafas de cores que Joseph Smith atopou coas tabletas de ouro; as gafas máxicas, que cando as puxeches, de súpeto podías ler a escritura xeroglífica.<br/>Hai quen di que o Urim e o Tumim eran en realidade unha pedra negra e unha pedra branca que se levaba nunha bolsa no peito do sacerdote. Rezaban e facíanlle ao Señor unha pregunta en particular. Lembras que David estaba preguntando ao Señor preguntas definitivas: "Señor, imos saír contra os filisteos?" A resposta foi: "Non." Entón, de novo, ao día seguinte, "Señor, imos saír contra os filisteos?" A resposta foi: "Si." "Cando imos?" Eles facían preguntas específicas, e o Señor dirixíalles a través do Urim e o Tummin. Dicían que o sacerdote oraría, buscaría a Deus, e logo chegaría a unha das dúas pedras e sacaría. Se fose a pedra branca, era unha resposta si. Se fose un non, entón sería a pedra negra a que sacaría. Algúns incluso din que o termo é extraído deste Urim e Tumim. De feito, no orixinal é un non-voto en contra dun proxecto ou idea en particular. Non sabemos o que eran o Urim e o Tumim, pero durante o Antigo Testamento usaron un método de sorteo para determinar a vontade de Deus.<br/>Así que aquí os discípulos están recollendo o mesmo que están lanzando os dados para ver cal dos dous compañeiros que Deus escolleu para substituír a Xudas Iscariote.<br/>A sorte caeu sobre Matías; foi contado cos once (Actos 1:26).<br/>Agora, quen no mundo é Matías? Ninguén nunca escoitou falar del antes ou despois. Será interesante coñecer a Matías e descubrir quen é e o que fixo. Creo que a partir da historia posterior, é obvio asumir que Deus escolleu a Paulo como un apóstolo. Agora, esta é a última vez que lemos deles buscando discernir a vontade de Deus por sorteo ou por unha sorte de cousa.<br/>Coñezo un home hoxe, buscando discernir a vontade do Señor, vai orar e facerlle unha pregunta ao Señor. Terá dez céntimos no peto, e mentres reza, collerá os céntimos cos ollos pechados e poñeraos sobre a mesa, e se todos soben cabezas, é un si. Unha cousa interesante, de cando en vez, todos van subir cabezas, e iso é bastante boa probabilidade. Con todo, non atopamos ningún patrón para isto despois de que se lle deu o Espírito Santo. Unha vez que o Espírito Santo veu sobre a igrexa, entón o Espírito Santo empezou a falarlles e dirixilos. E o Espírito Santo dixo: "Separade-me Paulo e Bernabé para o ministerio onde os chamei" (Feitos 13:2). E o Espírito Santo enviounos. Así que atopamos a igrexa máis directamente guiada polo Espírito Santo. Unha vez que veu o Espírito Santo, este lanzamento de dados para descubrir a vontade de Deus foi posto a un lado.<br/>"<br/><br/>Versión King James<br/><br/>Esta é a versión de 1769 King James da Santa Biblia (tamén coñecida como a versión autorizada).

In fact, dynamic drivers work exactly the same as dynamic microphones but in reverse. Inside a dynamic driver there is a magnet, and when you plug in the headphones, you are sending a AC current through it which will turn the voice coil into a magnet. Depending on the direction of the current, the polarity of the magnet will change. Now since we know for a magnet, same charges repels and different charges attract, we know that the voice coil will move back and forth depending on it's polarity at the time. The voice coil is attached to the diaphragm which will then move back and forth creating a sound wave. The same occurs in reverse, if you move a coil through a magnet you produce a current instead. Since your voice is pushing the diaphragm, it is moving the voice coil back and forth generating the current you have observed.<br/><br/>100+ Head-Fier<br/><br/>Joined:<br/>Nov 7, 2011<br/><br/>Posts:<br/>134<br/><br/>Likes: 55<br/><br/>Exactly.

Stalin's opposition within the party, including Bukharin, Yagoda and Rykov were purged in these show trials, as Stalin manipulatively forced them to confess to crimes of planning a coup and opposing the state, even if there was no proof. Gabor T Rittersporn said, "Many of the victims were sincerely devoted to the principles of Bolshevism." This amplifies proof that the Bolshevik ideals that had once been the roots of the Communist Party were being disarranged and destroyed by the Purges. The party was depleted and former members helplessly watched Stalin use the great purge as a tool to transform Russia from a one party state to an unchallenged dictatorship. Again, the purges were shattering the framework of the Communist Party, formed during the Bolshevik revolution. This agrees with the "Stalin the executioner" source as both show the manipulative character, that helped the dictator to enhance his grip on Russia's throat.<br/>The manipulative manner, with which Stalin incriminated his targeted opposition during the purges, in the eyes of everyday Russians, also had an implosive impact on Soviet Society. Stalin was able to collect support from the people through his use of propaganda and the media to help him develop a "cult of personality" and the image of a heroic and brave leader. Through this support Stalin implanted mistrust into the minds of the people, convincing them that traitors of the revolution and what he described as 'enemies of the people', were amongst them.

A oposición de Stalin dentro do partido, incluíndo Bukharin, Yagoda e Rykov, foron purgadas nestes xuízos de demostración, xa que Stalin os forzou manipulativamente a confesar os crimes de planear un golpe de estado e opoñerse ao estado, aínda que non houbese probas. Gabor T. Rittersporn dixo: "Moitas das vítimas estaban sinceramente dedicadas aos principios do bolxevismo". Isto amplifica a proba de que os ideais bolxeviques que antes foran as raíces do Partido Comunista estaban sendo desorganizados e destruídos polas purgas. O partido esgotouse e os antigos membros observaron impotentes a Stalin usar a gran purga como unha ferramenta para transformar a Rusia dun estado de partido único a unha ditadura incuestionable. Unha vez máis, as purgas estaban a romper o marco do Partido Comunista, formado durante a revolución bolxevique.

Sometimes there are even matchups where the enemy team is fully maxed and none of us are. this is why i dont play brawl stars seriously anymore. It's not even like there arent many players who are not maxed and around 600 trophies. It's annoying.<br/>Edit: I think supercell should have at least a basic mechanism that takes the average of levels of brawlers when setting up matches.<br/><br/>Except trophies don't really indicate your skill. They indicate the skill of the teammates you are placed with. And I'm fine with playing against higher level brawlers, but when one team is all level 10 and the other team isn't, clearly it's unbalanced.<br/><br/>I reccomend getting some good friends to play with, me and 2 friends got my friends power 1 tick to rank 28 by playing gem grab with a certain composition all day and we made it without a single one of us being maxed with our brawlers.<br/><br/>I Know how you feel I used to have brawlers in high trophies with low level and it's to difficult to go more further and everything I was saying to myself "I want to have star powers" really supercell needs to make balance to the star powers or at least make a better matchmaking system.<br/><br/>I kinda feel this. I ain't as good at the game as you, but I got Emz to 500 at power 1 and the matchmaking was horrible. Maxed out players everywhere! And it didn't help that the majority of my teammates had around 5-8k trophies... I had to resort to solo showdown last minute because I can either ambush unsuspecting players or simply play a little aggressive at the right times. But I really wish that it could be a bit easier for people who want to push brawlers to really high trophy ranges without having the luxury of star powers.<br/><br/>Altho spike is still good without curveball. Curveball was just a help for hitting your shots more often as spike. But even before curveball was released, spike was a really strong brawler, so he will remain the same now.<br/><br/>I agree that they should have nerfed ambush, but I think they are trying to balance both Snappy Sniping and Ambush, as they are both getting merged with this change. She was becoming a little powerful, but still not nerf-worthy<br/><br/>I'm not sure about this, but now that Darryl got a noticeable buff, looking at their new stats, it looks like Darryl might overshadow Bull, as not only he can always deal more damage than Bull, he won't die as early anymore, so their survivability will be similar without star power (although Bull's survivability is still noticeably better than Darryl's if he had Tough Guy). Not only that, Darryl's super can auto regenerate, meaning Darryl MIGHT be able to be played effectively both as a heavyweight AND an assassin at the same time (before he sucks as a heavyweight but decent as an assassin)<br/><br/>But hes overrated af. And you get trophies with him really easily. So im kinda ok with the nerf. I havent even played him since when I got him to 500 (around 5 months ago), so not that I care that much either.<br/><br/>Why doesn't Poco/Penny get a HP nerf, if they are Marksman/Healer respectively not a tank?<br/>Why isn't Rosa's tankyness nerfed, cough 70% damage reduction?<br/>Why is Tick allowed to have the highest range and the most free pokedamage in the entire game?<br/>Why doesn't Leon get a HP/Damage buff?<br/><br/>Be that as it may, it was Ambush that was OP, not base Piper. I would argue that Ambush is the best star power in the game (now even more so since the percentage of damage increase indirectly went up) and base Piper was a bottom-10 brawler.<br/><br/>What Supercell should do is revert both nerfs, reduce Ambush to 600, and reduce Snappy Sniping to 0.25 since it'd be indirectly buffed by the base damage buff.<br/><br/>Yea and I believe they went a bit too far with Rosa, because now she is basically the better bull now when it comes to tanking, which she has been for a while. Now, Darryl might as well be a smaller, more powerful bull<br/><br/>Why? I feel she needs a buff in almost everything except her star power. Her health and speed make her super a bit more difficult to use, because she can die pretty easily, and it is really difficult for her to trap faster brawlers like Crow. Her star power is a bit broken though... | Supercell está a enlouquecer a loitadores no canto de enlouquecer os poderes estelares. Estaba en 750 a tempada pasada con potencia 8 nita e é moi difícil superar que, por exemplo, os poderes estelares xoguen un papel realmente dominante. O emparellamento tamén é lixo. Cando xogo agarrar xoias (alrededor de 600 trofeos), a miúdo hai encontros onde o equipo inimigo ten un xogador máis que nós que está máximo e non é nin sequera que temos un lvl 9 para competir contra iso. Ás veces hai mesmo encontros onde o equipo inimigo está completamente maxed e ningún de nós está. é por iso que eu non xogo estrelas de pelexa en serio máis. Non é nin sequera como se houbese moitos xogadores que non están maxed e ao redor de 600 trofeos. É molesto.<br/>Editar: Creo que a supercélula debería ter polo menos un mecanismo básico que tome a media de niveis de pelexadores ao configurar partidas.<br/><br/>Excepto que os trofeos realmente non indican a túa habilidade. Indican a habilidade dos compañeiros de equipo cos que estás colocado. E estou ben con xogar contra pelexadores de nivel superior, pero cando un equipo é de nivel 10 e o outro non, claramente está desequilibrado.<br/><br/>Eu recomendo conseguir algúns bos amigos para xogar con, eu e 2 amigos obtiven os meus amigos poder 1 garrapata para o rango 28 xogando xoia agarrar cunha certa composición todo o día e conseguimos sen un só de nós sendo maxed cos nosos loitadores.<br/><br/>Eu sei como se sente que eu adoitaba ter pelexadores en trofeos altos con baixo nivel e é difícil ir máis lonxe e todo o que estaba dicindo a min mesmo "Eu quero ter poderes estelares" realmente supercell precisa para equilibrar os poderes estelares ou polo menos facer un mellor sistema de emparellamento.<br/><br/>Sinto isto. Non son tan bo no xogo como ti, pero cheguei a Emz a 500 no poder 1 e o emparellamento foi horrible. Máximo xogadores en todas partes! E non axudou que a maioría dos meus compañeiros de equipo tiñan ao redor de 5-8k trofeos ... Tiven que recorrer ao enfrontamento en solitario no último minuto porque podo emboscar xogadores desprevenidos ou simplemente xogar un pouco agresivo nos momentos axeitados. Pero eu realmente desexaba que puidese ser un pouco máis fácil para a xente que quere empurrar os loitadores a rangos de trofeos realmente altos sen ter o luxo de poderes estelares.<br/><br/>Altho spike aínda é bo sen curveball. Curveball foi só unha axuda para golpear os seus tiros máis a miúdo como spike. Pero mesmo antes de que se lanzase curveball, spike era un brawler realmente forte, polo que seguirá sendo o mesmo agora.<br/><br/>Estou de acordo que deberían ter emboscado nervioso, pero creo que están tentando equilibrar tanto Snappy Sniping e Emboscada, xa que ambos se están fusionando con este cambio. Ela estaba a facerse un pouco poderoso, pero aínda non digno de nervios<br/><br/>Non estou seguro disto, pero agora que Darryl tivo un notable afianzamento, mirando as súas novas estatísticas, parece que Darryl podería ofuscar Bull, xa que non só sempre pode causar máis dano que Bull, non morrerá tan cedo, polo que a súa supervivencia será similar sen poder estelar (aínda que a supervivencia de Bull aínda é notablemente mellor que a de Darryl se tivera Tough). Non só iso, o súper de Darryl pode auto rexenerarse, o que significa que Darryl PODE ser xogado de forma efectiva tanto como un peso pesado como un asasino ao mesmo tempo (antes de que suga como un peso pesado pero decente como un asasino).<br/><br/>Pero está sobrevalorado af. E podes conseguir trofeos con el con moita facilidade. Así que estou un pouco ben co nervio. Nin sequera o xoguei desde que o levei a 500 (hai uns 5 meses), así que tampouco me importa tanto.<br/><br/>Por que Poco / Penny non obter un nervio HP, se son Marksman / Healer respectivamente non un tanque?<br/>Por que o tankyness de Rosa non está nervioso, tose 70% de redución de danos?<br/>Por que se permite que Tick teña o rango máis alto e o pokedamage máis libre en todo o xogo?<br/>Por que non se lle dá a Leon un HP/Damage buff?<br/><br/>Seja como for, era Ambush que era OP, non Piper base. Eu argumentaría que Ambush é a mellor potencia estelar no xogo (agora aínda máis xa que a porcentaxe de aumento de dano subiu indirectamente) e base Piper era un loitador inferior-10.<br/><br/>O que Supercell debería facer é reverter ambos os nervios, reducir Emboscada a 600, e reducir Snappy Sniping a 0.25 xa que sería reforzado indirectamente polo buff de dano base.<br/><br/>Si e eu creo que foron un pouco demasiado lonxe con Rosa, porque agora ela é basicamente o mellor touro agora cando se trata de tanquear, que foi por un tempo. Agora, Darryl podería ser tamén un touro máis pequeno e máis poderoso<br/><br/>Por que? Sinto que necesita unha mellora en case todo, excepto no seu poder estelar. A súa saúde e velocidade fan que sexa un pouco máis difícil de usar, porque pode morrer con bastante facilidade, e é realmente difícil para ela atrapar a loitadores máis rápidos como Crow. O seu poder estelar está un pouco roto aínda que... |

| Self-Employment Part 1<br/><br/>When you accept an employment in any organisation, you have to perform various jobs as per the requirements of your employer and you may get a fixed amount of income as salary. You may run a small retail shop, tailoring shop, restaurant, bakery and confectionery, beauty salon, etc. in your locality. You may get engaged in trading or manufacturing on a small scale or providing some service for a price. Such economic activities are known as self-employment.<br/><br/>Meaning of Self-Employment<br/><br/>Earning is necessary for a living. Our father, mother, brothers, sisters and others may be engaged in different economic activities through which they earn their livelihood. These persons are engaged in an economic activity which is termed as wage employment or paid employment. But there are many persons who engage themselves in an occupation or some business which they start and manage on their own. They put in their best effort and take all types of risks to pursue their careers successfully. The entire earning of their work goes to them. All of us have seen small grocery shops, tailoring shops, medical stores etc. in our locality. These are owned and managed by a person, with or without the help of some assistants. Their economic activities are termed as self-employment. So, when an individual engages in any economic activity and manages it on his own, it is known as self-employment.<br/><br/>Objectives<br/><br/>After studying this lesson, you will be able to:<br/><br/>Image of Objectives<br/><br/>Image of Objectives<br/><br/>Characteristics of Self-Employment<br/><br/>It involves ownership and management of activities by a person although he/she may take the help of one or two persons to assist him/her. Thus, self-employment may provide employment to other persons as well.<br/><br/>The earning from self-employment is not fixed. It depends on the income one can earn by producing or buying and selling goods or providing services to others at a price.<br/><br/>In self-employment, the owner alone has to take the profit and bear the risk of loss. So, we find a direct link between the effort and reward in self-employment.<br/><br/>It requires some amount of capital investment, although it may be small.<br/><br/>In self-employment, a person is free to take decisions in respect of running his business profitably and avail of any opportunity that may come up for expansion of his business. It gives complete freedom to work as per one's own will and within the parameters of the prevailing laws.<br/><br/>Thus, self-employment may be defined as, an economic activity which one may perform on his own as a gainful occupation, and this may consist of producing and selling goods, buying and selling goods, or rendering services for a price. | Autónomo Parte 1<br/><br/>Cando acepta un emprego en calquera organización, ten que realizar varios traballos segundo os requisitos do seu empregador e pode obter unha cantidade fixa de ingresos como salario. Pode executar unha pequena tenda de venda polo miúdo, sastrería, restaurante, panadería e confitería, salón de beleza, etc. na súa localidade. Pode involucrarse en comercio ou fabricación a pequena escala ou proporcionar algún servizo por un prezo. Estas actividades económicas coñécense como traballo por conta propia.<br/><br/>Significado do autoemprego<br/><br/>Gañar é necesario para vivir. O noso pai, nai, irmáns, irmás e outros poden estar involucrados en diferentes actividades económicas a través das cales gañan o seu sustento. Estas persoas están implicadas nunha actividade económica que se denomina emprego asalariado ou traballo asalariado, pero hai moitas persoas que se dedican a unha ocupación ou a algún negocio que inician e xestionan por conta propia. Poñen o seu mellor esforzo e corren todo tipo de riscos para seguir as súas carreiras con éxito. Toda a ganancia do seu traballo vai para eles. Todos vimos pequenas tendas de comestibles, sastrerías, tendas médicas etc. na nosa localidade. Estas son propiedade e xestionadas por unha persoa, con ou sen a axuda dalgúns asistentes. As súas actividades económicas denomínanse traballo por conta propia. Polo tanto, cando un individuo se involucra en calquera actividade económica e xestiona por conta propia, coñécese como traballo por conta propia.<br/><br/>Obxectivos<br/><br/>Despois de estudar esta lección, poderás:<br/><br/>Imaxe dos obxectivos<br/><br/>Imaxe dos obxectivos<br/><br/>Características do autoemprego<br/><br/>Implica a propiedade e a xestión das actividades por unha persoa, aínda que pode contar coa axuda dunha ou dúas persoas para axudala. Así, o traballo por conta propia pode proporcionar emprego a outras persoas tamén.<br/><br/>A ganancia do traballo por conta propia non é fixa. Depende dos ingresos que un pode gañar producindo ou comprando e vendendo bens ou prestando servizos a outros a un prezo.<br/><br/>No traballo por conta propia, só o propietario ten que tomar as ganancias e asumir o risco de perda. Así, atopamos unha relación directa entre o esforzo e a recompensa no traballo por conta propia.<br/><br/>Require un investimento de capital, aínda que pode ser pequeno.<br/><br/>No traballo por conta propia, unha persoa é libre de tomar decisións con respecto á xestión do seu negocio de forma rendible e aproveitar calquera oportunidade que poida xurdir para a expansión do seu negocio. Dá total liberdade para traballar segundo a propia vontade e dentro dos parámetros das leis imperantes.<br/><br/>Así, o traballo por conta propia pode definirse como unha actividade económica que un pode realizar pola súa conta como unha ocupación lucrativa, e isto pode consistir en producir e vender bens, comprar e vender bens, ou prestar servizos por un prezo. |
