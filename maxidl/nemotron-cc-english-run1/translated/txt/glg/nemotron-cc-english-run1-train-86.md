| Leclaire<br/><br/>The historic Leclaire neighborhood, once referred to as Edwardsville's "suburb to the south," was founded as a cooperative community in 1890 and remained a separate village until annexed to the city of Edwardsville in 1934. Newspapers and magazines throughout the United States and Europe reported on the Leclaire experiment, particularly during the first 20 years of its existence. In 1979, due to its unique history, the former village was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.<br/><br/>Leclaire was founded by Nelson Oliver Nelson, a St. Louis plumbing manufacturer who, for many years, sought to advance the plight of the working class. Nelson wanted to improve working conditions for his employees and provide housing near the factories so workers and their families could easily participate in recreational and educational programs offered free of charge by the company. Prior to 1890, while still in St. Louis, the N. O. Nelson Company's manufacturing and distribution businesses began providing profit sharing along with educational and recreational opportunities. The Leclaire cooperative experiment would bring additional benefits.<br/><br/>When Nelson employees indicated they wanted to relocate to a rural location, company representatives approached leaders of small towns in several Missouri and Illinois communities near their St. Louis headquarters. They were looking for a suitable property to build new factories and a model village. South of Edwardsville they found a 125-acre tract of land with access to water, coal, and transportation. Local businessmen acted quickly to offer a financial incentive. In less than three weeks, the community raised a fund of $20,000 from individual contributions of between $1 and $1,000 to entice Nelson to choose Edwardsville for his enterprise.<br/><br/>City leaders had hoped to locate property inside the city limits of Edwardsville, but when no suitable site could be found, they were confident that the Nelson investment south of town would soon become a part of Edwardsville. Although Nelson fulfilled all the contingencies for construction and job creation in his contract, it would be 44 years before annexation to Edwardsville. Leclaire, bounded by Madison/Brown Avenues to the east, the railroad tracks to the west, Hadley/McKinley Avenues on the south and Wolf Street to the north, remained an independent village from 1890 to 1934. During that time it earned a reputation for innovations in business, education and residential planning.<br/><br/>The village of Leclaire on a 1931 map of Edwardsville<br/>Courtesy of Paul Jenkins<br/><br/>Nelson's decision to build a village was not made on a whim. By the late 1880s he was an international leader in the fields of cooperation and profit-sharing, exchanging social theories with others around the world while expanding his St. Louis business. He named his experimental village after the Parisian profit-sharer, Edme Jean Leclaire, but he visited many other social visionaries who provided information and inspiration. Compiling the best ideas from these examples, Nelson founded Leclaire to, in his words, "give work, promote intelligence, provide recreation, foster beauty, and make homes." These were all factors he determined necessary for men to lead fulfilling lives. Later writers used these words to formulate Leclaire's founding principles: Work, Homes, Education, Recreation, and Beauty, but with the additional important principle of Freedom.<br/><br/>Work<br/><br/>Work could be considered the most important of these factors since without the factory jobs in Leclaire, there would be no village. The brick factory buildings were designed by architect E. A. Cameron to provide natural light, ventilation in the summer, and heated floors in the winter. There was a fire suppression system and, although industrial accidents were not eliminated, every effort was made to guarantee the safety of the workers. The ivy-covered brick buildings were surrounded by well-manicured lawns and flower gardens giving the complex a campus-like appearance. In 1894, New York World reporter Nellie Bly called the buildings "the ideal perfection of buildings for man to labor in".<br/><br/>The manufacturing complex of the N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company in Leclaire<br/>From Friends of Leclaire<br/><br/>Nelson company policies were designed to protect the financial stability of employees. Workers could earn a share of the profits and have a voice in the company if they chose that option. The profit-sharing plan gave Nelson employees a pride of ownership that resulted in a supportive workforce. There were a few short-lived labor strikes over the years, but for the most part, labor problems were rare. Workers also had reasonable hours and competitive wages. There was a provident fund that provided for pensions and sick leave, as well as widow pensions if a worker died, whether or not the death was related to his employment.<br/><br/>Company headquarters for the N. O. Nelson Company (NONCO) remained in St. Louis, but all of the N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company was moved to Leclaire. The manufacturing company was divided into shops that made a variety of products. In 1900, the shops became independent companies for tax purposes, but all were still owned by the N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company. The shops included the Cabinet Mill where wood products from cabinetry to millwork were produced. The skilled craftsmen that worked here also fulfilled special contracts, including teller cages for a local bank and an altar still in use at St. Andrew's Episcopal Church in Edwardsville. The Marble Shop specialized in architectural marble that was cut and installed by Nelson crews in homes, businesses, and even state capitols throughout the Midwest. The Machine Shop, which became Bignall and Keeler, made pipe fitting machines, pumps, gauges, and various mechanical tools expected in the plumbing trade. They also branched out to manufacture specialty items like the Leclaire Bicycle in the mid-1890s. The Brass Shop included a foundry where various plumbing pipes and tools were manufactured. These examples represent just some of the work done in the Leclaire factories. The company's logo was a stylized "NONCO" that can still be seen on plumbing fixtures and some fire hydrants in Edwardsville today.<br/><br/>Homes<br/><br/>Before homes could be built, housing was needed for workers who were completing the factory buildings as well as building homes. To meet those needs, the company built the "Club House," a large building that served many purposes. In addition to lodging, it was the community's first educational building, and it contained a well-stocked library.<br/><br/>Construction of the residential portion of Leclaire began immediately after the village was founded in June of 1890. Julius Pitzman, the innovative landscape architect who laid out the first lots in Leclaire, set them up with a number of protective covenants. The covenants provided for wide, curvilinear streets, large lots, and a deed restriction that limited the properties to residential or educational purposes only. The company paved the streets, provided electric street lights, installed sidewalks, and planted hundreds of trees along the streets of Leclaire. Later sections of Leclaire were laid out with a conventional grid design and smaller lots, but still included the deed restrictions.<br/><br/>A Leclaire Victorian cottage in 1907<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Initially the homes were built by the company and then sold at near cost to Nelson employees to encourage home ownership. If a worker became ill and could not make his mortgage, payments were suspended until after he returned to work. The homes were offered in a variety of house designs and the company advertised that no two dwellings were alike. The earliest homes were primarily Victorian cottages that came with electricity and running water. These were followed by bungalows, foursquares, and even some kit homes. Residents could purchase a company-built home or buy an empty lot and build a house themselves, provided the architectural design met company standards.<br/><br/>In later years, lots were sold to investors, usually Edwardsville residents, and many homes in the 1920s were built by local contractors who then sold them to area residents.<br/><br/>Education<br/><br/>Nelson believed in education for everyone, including the working class. Educational programming began with a kindergarten at the Club House in 1892 and continued in the new educational building at 722 Holyoake Road. Commonly called the "School House," this building provided a large hall for meetings and programs, but had moveable partitions to divide it into classroom space during the day. In the evenings, there were dances, meetings, or programs of the Leclaire Self-Culture Club which featured weekly lectures by Washington University professors or nationally known speakers who, like N. O. Nelson, were part of the social betterment movement at the turn of the century. These included Jane Addams, Edward Everett Hale, Samuel "Golden Rule" Jones, and author Charlotte Perkins Gilman, among others.<br/><br/>Children enrolled in the Leclaire kindergarten in 1913<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>In the ten years following the 1895 construction of the education building, there were a series of educational experiments including an industrial school, college, night school, and an academy. The earliest and longest-lived endeavor was the morning kindergarten, founded in 1892, that used the Fröbel Model. This two-year program was free to everyone, including Edwardsville children, until 1931 when for financial reasons the company began charging tuition to students who were not the children of employees. Nelson Manufacturing operated a kindergarten until 1934 when the building was turned over to the Edwardsville School District for a nominal fee.<br/><br/>Recreation<br/><br/>Boaters on Leclaire Lake in 1915<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Recreation was an important feature of Leclaire. The company provided sports facilities for baseball, tennis, and later, football. A bowling and billiard hall was constructed and there was a lake for boating, swimming, fishing, or ice skating in winter. Leclaire Park was furnished with boathouses, male & female bath houses, and a large pavilion. Residents organized dances, hayrides, spelling bees, and other activities, and the company sponsored a band that played regularly at entertainments in the village or in Edwardsville. Like the educational functions at the Club House and School House, the recreational facilities at Leclaire were open to all and were often a destination for Edwardsville and even St. Louis visitors.<br/><br/>Beauty<br/><br/>Early photograph of Leclaire Lake<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>The last of the factors Nelson deemed important for a satisfying life concerned the environment. Nelson knew about the importance of healthy living. He valued the beauty and cleanliness that could be found in the country, and encouraged all in Leclaire to beautify their property by planting gardens and orchards. Nelson himself led by example, so a company greenhouse provided free flowers and competitions were held for the most beautiful yards. Leclaire was laid out so that the entire village had a park-like setting still evident today.<br/><br/>Freedom<br/><br/>The Leclaire Cooperative store<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Nelson listed five founding principles for Leclaire, but modern writers add a sixth: Freedom. All of the programs offered by the company were available to employees as well as local residents, but none were mandatory. The freedom to choose whether or not to participate in company programs was entirely up to the individual. Residents of Leclaire could work for Nelson Manufacturing or elsewhere, and workers were under no obligation to live in Leclaire. Participation in recreational and educational programs was also optional. There was also a company store where employees could shop, but unlike other company towns, no one was in debt to the company store. The Leclaire Store was a cooperative where members were charged fair market prices, but were then paid quarterly dividends.<br/><br/>A Different Company Town<br/><br/>All of these benefits made Leclaire unique from other company towns. But there were also individual instances where the company showed compassion and care for the employees. The company closed the factories and hired excursion trains to take workers and their families to St. Louis for a day at the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair. When money was tight, Nelson would occasionally place extra cash in each pay envelope to make life easier for workers, and if he instituted a program the men did not agree with, they talked it out and, as often as not, Nelson would reverse himself.<br/><br/>Born in Lillesand, Norway, in 1841, N. O. Nelson was a complicated man. He was a capitalist who believed in free enterprise, but also a socialist, a follower of the "Golden Rule", and a patriot who served for the Union in the Civil War. By 1900, he was a multimillionaire, but by the time of his death in 1922, he had given it all away for the betterment of the working class.<br/><br/>Although Leclaire was not Nelson's only social experiment, it is considered his most successful endeavor. Other major efforts for social betterment included a chain of co-operative grocery stores in New Orleans, a kindergarten for the children of black employees in his Bessemer, Alabama, factories, and a home for consumptives in Indio, California.<br/><br/>Nelson's Village of Leclaire was renowned internationally as a noteworthy and successful experiment. It was described in the New York World on numerous occasions but in particular by reporter Nellie Bly in 1894 who wrote at length about the model town where "The labor question is solved and everybody happy in a little village near St. Louis." The Los Angeles Times also regularly reported on N. O. Nelson, as did the Chicago Daily Tribune and numerous other publications.<br/><br/>In a speech at Leclaire's 15th anniversary celebration in 1915, Nelson said, "Leclaire extends to you a wide open hospitality, and bids you enjoy today the ease and comfort and beauty and inspiration which we enjoy every day." More than a century has passed since that day, but the invitation still stands. Residents and researchers are invited to learn about Leclaire's history and consider the lessons that might be learned for the betterment of future generations.<br/><br/>One of the former buildings of the manufacturing complex in 2019, which now serves as the N. O. Nelson Campus of Lewis and Clark Community College<br/>Photo by Ben Ostermeier<br/><br/>Friends of Leclaire, organized in 1990 following Leclaire's Centennial celebration, promotes the history of Leclaire through a website (historic-leclaire.org), publications, and a festival, Leclaire Parkfest, held annually on the third Sunday in October | Leclaire<br/><br/>O barrio histórico de Leclaire, unha vez coñecido como o "suburbio ao sur" de Edwardsville, foi fundado como unha comunidade cooperativa en 1890 e permaneceu como unha vila separada ata que se anexionou á cidade de Edwardsville en 1934. Periódicos e revistas de todos os Estados Unidos e Europa informaron sobre o experimento Leclaire, particularmente durante os primeiros 20 anos da súa existencia. En 1979, debido á súa historia única, a antiga vila foi inscrita no Rexistro Nacional de Lugares Históricos.<br/><br/>Leclaire foi fundada por Nelson Oliver Nelson, un fabricante de fontanería de St. Louis que, durante moitos anos, buscou avanzar na difícil situación da clase obreira. Nelson quería mellorar as condicións de traballo dos seus empregados e proporcionar vivenda preto das fábricas para que os traballadores e as súas familias puidesen participar facilmente en programas recreativos e educativos ofrecidos gratuitamente pola empresa. Antes de 1890, mentres aínda estaba en St. Louis, os negocios de fabricación e distribución da N. O. Nelson Company comezaron a proporcionar beneficios compartidos xunto con oportunidades educativas e recreativas. O experimento cooperativo Leclaire traería beneficios adicionais.<br/><br/>Cando os empregados de Nelson indicaron que querían trasladarse a un lugar rural, os representantes da compañía achegáronse aos líderes de pequenas cidades en varias comunidades de Missouri e Illinois preto da súa sede de St. Louis. Buscaban unha propiedade axeitada para construír novas fábricas e unha aldea modelo. Ao sur de Edwardsville atoparon un tramo de 125 acres de terra con acceso a auga, carbón e transporte. Os empresarios locais actuaron rapidamente para ofrecer un incentivo financeiro. En menos de tres semanas, a comunidade recadou un fondo de 20.000 dólares de contribucións individuais de entre 1 e 1.000 dólares para atraer a Nelson a elixir Edwardsville para a súa empresa.<br/><br/>Os líderes da cidade esperaban localizar a propiedade dentro dos límites da cidade de Edwardsville, pero cando non se puido atopar un sitio axeitado, estaban seguros de que o investimento de Nelson ao sur da cidade pronto se convertería en parte de Edwardsville. Aínda que Nelson cumpriu todas as continxencias para a construción e creación de emprego no seu contrato, pasarían 44 anos antes da anexión a Edwardsville. Leclaire, delimitada polas avenidas Madison/Brown ao leste, as vías férreas ao oeste, as avenidas Hadley/McKinley ao sur e a rúa Wolf ao norte, permaneceu unha vila independente de 1890 a 1934. Durante ese tempo gañou unha reputación polas innovacións en negocios, educación e planificación residencial.<br/><br/>A aldea de Leclaire nun mapa de Edwardsville de 1931.<br/>Autor: Paul Jenkins<br/><br/>A finais da década de 1880 era un líder internacional nos campos da cooperación e a participación nas ganancias, intercambiando teorías sociais con outros de todo o mundo mentres expandía o seu negocio en St. Louis. Denominou a súa aldea experimental en honor ao parisiense Edme Jean Leclaire, pero visitou a moitos outros visionarios sociais que proporcionaron información e inspiración. Compilando as mellores ideas a partir destes exemplos, Nelson fundou Leclaire para, nas súas palabras, "dar traballo, promover a intelixencia, proporcionar recreación, fomentar a beleza e facer fogares". Os escritores posteriores utilizaron estas palabras para formular os principios fundadores de Leclaire: traballo, fogares, educación, recreación e beleza, pero co importante principio adicional da liberdade.<br/><br/>Traballo<br/><br/>O traballo podería considerarse o máis importante destes factores xa que sen os empregos de fábrica en Leclaire, non habería aldea. Os edificios da fábrica de ladrillos foron deseñados polo arquitecto E. A. Cameron para proporcionar luz natural, ventilación no verán e chans quentes no inverno. Houbo un sistema de supresión de incendios e, aínda que non se eliminaron os accidentes industriais, fixéronse todos os esforzos para garantir a seguridade dos traballadores. Os edificios de ladrillos cubertos de hera estaban rodeados de céspedes e xardíns de flores ben coidados que daban ao complexo unha aparencia de campus. En 1894, a reporteira de New York World Nellie Bly chamou aos edificios "a perfección ideal dos edificios para que o home poida traballar".<br/><br/>O complexo de fabricación da N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company en Leclaire<br/>Amigos de Leclaire<br/><br/>As políticas da empresa de Nelson foron deseñadas para protexer a estabilidade financeira dos empregados. Os traballadores poderían gañar unha parte dos beneficios e ter voz na empresa se elixisen esa opción. O plan de reparto de beneficios deu aos empregados de Nelson un orgullo de propiedade que resultou nunha forza de traballo de apoio. Houbo algunhas folgas laborais de curta duración ao longo dos anos, pero na súa maioría, os problemas laborais eran raros. Os traballadores tamén tiñan horarios razoables e salarios competitivos. Había un fondo de pensións que proporcionaba pensións e baixas por enfermidade, así como pensións de viúva se un traballador morría, se a morte estaba relacionada ou non co seu emprego.<br/><br/>A sede da N. O. Nelson Company (NONCO) permaneceu en St. Louis, pero toda a N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company trasladouse a Leclaire. En 1900, as tendas convertéronse en empresas independentes para fins fiscais, pero todas aínda eran propiedade da N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company. Os artesáns cualificados que traballaban aquí tamén cumpriron contratos especiais, incluíndo gaiolas de caixa para un banco local e un altar aínda en uso na Igrexa Episcopal de St. Andrew en Edwardsville. The Marble Shop especializouse en mármore arquitectónico que foi cortado e instalado por tripulacións de Nelson en casas, negocios e mesmo capitais estatais en todo o Medio Oeste. A Machine Shop, que se converteu en Bignall e Keeler, fabricou máquinas de encaixe de tubos, bombas, manómetros e varias ferramentas mecánicas que se esperaban no comercio de encanamento. Tamén se ramificaron para fabricar artigos especializados como a bicicleta Leclaire a mediados da década de 1890. A Brass Shop incluía unha fundición onde se fabricaban varias tubaxes e ferramentas. Estes exemplos representan só algunhas das obras realizadas nas fábricas de Leclaire. O logotipo da compañía era un "NONCO" estilizado que aínda se pode ver en aparellos de encanamento e algúns hidrantes de lume en Edwardsville hoxe.<br/><br/>Homes<br/><br/>Antes de que as casas puidesen ser construídas, necesítase vivenda para os traballadores que estaban completando os edificios da fábrica, así como a construción de casas. Para satisfacer esas necesidades, a compañía construíu a "Club House", un gran edificio que serviu a moitos propósitos. Ademais de aloxamento, foi o primeiro edificio educativo da comunidade, e contiña unha biblioteca ben abastecida.<br/><br/>A construción da parte residencial de Leclaire comezou inmediatamente despois de que a vila fose fundada en xuño de 1890. Julius Pitzman, o innovador arquitecto paisaxista que presentou os primeiros lotes en Leclaire, estableceunos cunha serie de convenios de protección. Os pactos establecían rúas amplas e curvilíneas, grandes lotes e unha restrición de escritura que limitaba as propiedades só a fins residenciais ou educativos. A compañía pavimentou as rúas, proporcionou luces eléctricas, instalou aceras e plantou centos de árbores ao longo das rúas de Leclaire. As seccións posteriores de Leclaire foron dispostas cun deseño de grella convencional e lotes máis pequenos, pero aínda incluían as restricións de escritura.<br/><br/>Unha cabana vitoriana de Leclaire en 1907<br/>por Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Inicialmente as casas foron construídas pola empresa e despois vendidas a un custo próximo aos empregados de Nelson para fomentar a propiedade da casa. Se un traballador enfermaba e non podía facer a súa hipoteca, os pagamentos suspendéronse ata despois de volver ao traballo. As casas foron ofrecidas nunha variedade de deseños de casas e a compañía publicou que non había dúas vivendas iguais. As primeiras casas eran principalmente casas vitorianas que viñan con electricidade e auga corrente. Os residentes podían mercar unha casa construída pola empresa ou mercar un lote baleiro e construír unha casa eles mesmos, sempre que o deseño arquitectónico cumprise os estándares da empresa.<br/><br/>Nos últimos anos, os lotes foron vendidos a investidores, xeralmente residentes de Edwardsville, e moitas casas na década de 1920 foron construídas por contratistas locais que despois vendéronos aos residentes da área.<br/><br/>Educación<br/><br/>A programación educativa comezou cun xardín de infancia na Club House en 1892 e continuou no novo edificio educativo no 722 Holyoake Road. Chamado comúnmente a "Casa da Escola", este edificio proporcionaba unha gran sala para reunións e programas, pero tiña particións móbiles para dividila en espazo de aula durante o día. Polas tardes, había bailes, reunións ou programas do Club de Auto-Cultura Leclaire que contaban con conferencias semanais de profesores da Universidade de Washington ou oradores coñecidos a nivel nacional que, como N. O. Nelson, formaban parte do movemento de mellora social a comezos do século. Estes incluían a Jane Addams, Edward Everett Hale, Samuel "Golden Rule" Jones, e a autora Charlotte Perkins Gilman, entre outros.<br/><br/>Nenos matriculados no xardín de infancia Leclaire en 1913<br/>por Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Nos dez anos seguintes á construción do edificio educativo en 1895, houbo unha serie de experimentos educativos, incluíndo unha escola industrial, unha universidade, unha escola nocturna e unha academia. O primeiro e máis longevo esforzo foi o xardín de infancia da mañá, fundado en 1892, que utilizou o Modelo Fröbel. Este programa de dous anos foi gratuíto para todos, incluídos os nenos de Edwardsville, ata 1931, cando por razóns financeiras a compañía comezou a cobrar a matrícula a estudantes que non eran fillos de empregados. Nelson Manufacturing operou un xardín de infancia ata 1934, cando o edificio foi entregado ao Distrito Escolar de Edwardsville por unha taxa nominal.<br/><br/>Recreación<br/><br/>Barqueiros no lago Leclaire en 1915<br/>por Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>A recreación foi unha característica importante de Leclaire. A compañía proporcionou instalacións deportivas para o béisbol, o tenis e, máis tarde, o fútbol. Construíuse unha boleira e unha sala de billar e había un lago para navegar, nadar, pescar ou patinar sobre xeo no inverno. O parque Leclaire estaba equipado con casetas de barcos, baños masculinos e femininos e un gran pavillón. Os residentes organizaban bailes, hairides, abellas ortográficas e outras actividades, e a compañía patrocinaba unha banda que tocaba regularmente en entretementos na vila ou en Edwardsville. Do mesmo xeito que as funcións educativas na Club House e School House, as instalacións recreativas en Leclaire estaban abertas a todos e eran a miúdo un destino para os visitantes de Edwardsville e mesmo de St. Louis.<br/><br/>Beleza<br/><br/>Fotografía do lago Leclaire<br/>por Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>O último dos factores que Nelson considerou importante para unha vida satisfactoria era o medio ambiente. Nelson sabía da importancia dunha vida saudable. Valorou a beleza e a limpeza que se podía atopar no país, e animou a todos en Leclaire a embellecer a súa propiedade plantando xardíns e hortas. O propio Nelson dirixiu o exemplo, polo que un invernadoiro da compañía proporcionou flores gratuítas e celebráronse concursos para os patios máis fermosos.<br/><br/>Liberdade<br/><br/>A tenda cooperativa Leclaire<br/>por Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Nelson enumerou cinco principios fundadores para Leclaire, pero os escritores modernos engadiron un sexto: Liberdade. Todos os programas ofrecidos pola compañía estaban dispoñibles para os empregados, así como para os residentes locais, pero ningún era obrigatorio. Os residentes de Leclaire podían traballar para Nelson Manufacturing ou noutro lugar, e os traballadores non estaban obrigados a vivir en Leclaire. A participación en programas recreativos e educativos tamén era opcional. Tamén había unha tenda da empresa onde os empregados podían facer compras, pero a diferenza doutros pobos da empresa, ninguén estaba en débeda coa tenda da empresa. A Leclaire Store era unha cooperativa onde os membros cobraban prezos de mercado xustos, pero entón pagábanse dividendos trimestrais.<br/><br/>Unha cidade diferente<br/><br/>Todos estes beneficios fixeron que Leclaire fose único doutras cidades da compañía, pero tamén houbo casos individuais nos que a compañía demostrou compaixón e coidado polos empregados. A compañía pechou as fábricas e contratou trens de excursión para levar os traballadores e as súas familias a St. Louis por un día na Feira Mundial de St. Louis de 1904. Cando o diñeiro era escaso, Nelson ocasionalmente colocaba diñeiro extra en cada sobre de paga para facer a vida máis fácil para os traballadores, e se instituía un programa con que os homes non estaban de acordo, falaban e, tantas veces como non, Nelson revertiríase a si mesmo.<br/><br/>Nado en Lillesand, Noruega, en 1841, N. O. Nelson era un home complicado. Era un capitalista que cría na libre empresa, pero tamén un socialista, un seguidor da "Regra de Ouro", e un patriota que serviu para a Unión na Guerra Civil. En 1900, era multimillonario, pero no momento da súa morte en 1922, entregárao todo para o melloramento da clase obreira.<br/><br/>Aínda que Leclaire non foi o único experimento social de Nelson, considérase o seu esforzo máis exitoso. Outros grandes esforzos para o melloramento social incluíron unha cadea de tendas de comestibles cooperativas en Nova Orleáns, un xardín de infancia para os fillos dos empregados negros no seu Bessemer, Alabama, fábricas, e un fogar para consumibles en Indio, California.<br/><br/>A aldea de Leclaire de Nelson foi recoñecida internacionalmente como un experimento notable e exitoso. Foi descrita no New York World en numerosas ocasións, pero en particular pola reporteira Nellie Bly en 1894, que escribiu longamente sobre a cidade modelo onde "A cuestión do traballo está resolta e todo o mundo feliz nunha pequena aldea preto de St. Louis". O Los Angeles Times tamén informou regularmente sobre N. O. Nelson, así como o Chicago Daily Tribune e numerosas outras publicacións.<br/><br/>Nun discurso na celebración do 15 aniversario de Leclaire en 1915, Nelson dixo: "Leclaire extende a vostede unha hospitalidade aberta, e ofrécelle gozar hoxe da facilidade e comodidade e beleza e inspiración que gozamos todos os días". Xa pasou máis dun século desde aquel día, pero a invitación aínda se mantén. Os residentes e os investigadores están invitados a coñecer a historia de Leclaire e considerar as leccións que se poderían aprender para o melloramento das xeracións futuras.<br/><br/>Un dos antigos edificios do complexo de fabricación en 2019, que agora serve como N.

| Author Visits via Zoom or Skype<br/><br/>I'm excited to visit with your students via Zoom or Skype! Skype is a great option for schools/classes who aren't bringing in in-person authors, but who want to explore books and poetry, connect with an author, and ask one-on-one questions.<br/><br/>Cost<br/><br/>I offer 30-45-minute Zoom or Skype visits with schools for $125 per session (or $200 for two sessions happening within three hours in the morning or the afternoon; $325 for three sessions in one day; $425 for four sessions in one day). In each session, I try to get kids as actively involved as possible. No, it's not the same kind of connection as an in-person visit offers, but it can still be inspiring and motivating for kids!<br/><br/>What I Do<br/><br/>Each session for up to 50 students includes:<br/><br/>5 minutes of tech set-up<br/><br/>3 segments of 10ish-minutes each — You choose from:<br/><br/>How I became a writer<br/><br/>Writing this particular book (you choose which book I focus on)<br/><br/>Reading (I read some poems and kids help me read others)<br/><br/>Classroom presentation (your students put on a reading or performance for me—a very appreciative audience!)<br/><br/>Writing a poem together<br/><br/>Question and answer session<br/><br/>5 minutes of wrap-ups/goodbyes<br/><br/>I also chat with classes of pre-service teachers or groups of in-service teachers about poetry and writing.<br/><br/>Tips for a Great Virtual Visit<br/><br/>Tips for a Successful Virtual Visit<br/><br/>One of my goals for virtual school visits is to capture the interactivity that makes in-person visits successful and fun. But the truth is that sometimes it's tough to be virtually interactive! The timing might not sync up correctly, which makes reading together a challenge, and it's really hard for me to hear individual students unless they come up and speak directly into the microphone/computer. But after some trial and error, I've discovered some ways to have the best virtual visits possible. Here they are: 10 ways to make my visit with your students a great experience!<br/><br/>Before the Visit<br/><br/>Get kids as excited as possible about the visit. Visit my website with them. Read some of my books with them. Gather some questions students have for me. Anything you do ahead of time to make it feel like a BIG DEAL will go a long way toward student engagement.<br/><br/>Position the video camera or laptop with webcam so that I can see as much of the audience as possible. It's hard to assess student engagement when I can only see a couple of students.<br/><br/>Limit each group to 50 students. It's incredibly hard to engage large groups via video.<br/><br/>I'll move quickly from topic to topic or poem to poem. Please remind students that they'll need to listen closely to understand what's going on.<br/><br/>Occasionally, I do a little Reader's Theater with students. If I send you any scripted student parts ahead of time, print a copy for EACH session and cut into pieces, if needed.<br/><br/>During the Visit<br/><br/>When I discuss a book, if you have that printed book, please hold it up for students to see.<br/><br/>You are my proxy. I often can't call on students and hear individual replies. So, I might say, "We're going to get 3 ideas. Raise your hand if you have an idea." Then YOU take over, call on three students, and announce those answers to everyone in the room and to me.<br/><br/>Choose confident, outgoing students for scripted student parts (if I send any ahead of time). During my in-person school visits, I try to draw out some of the less confident students, but I've found that this doesn't work as well during virtual visits because I can't hear them.<br/><br/>Have students with speaking parts sit up front. When it's time, have them stand up and remind them to speak loudly.<br/><br/>In virtual visits, behavior management falls solely on you. I often can't see exactly what's going on, so do please step in as needed. If there's a big disruption, just ask me to hold on for a moment so that I don't chatter on while nobody's paying attention:>)<br/><br/>Feel free to take pictures of me on-screen and share on social media–even though pictures of me often look ridiculous because I'm making funny faces or something while I read!<br/><br/>If you have any questions at all, please just ask, either before or during the visit!<br/><br/>Scheduling a Virtual Session<br/><br/>Are you interested in scheduling a virtual visit with me? Just email me to set up a date, and we'll go from there | Visitas do autor a través de Zoom ou Skype<br/><br/>Skype é unha gran opción para as escolas / clases que non están traendo autores en persoa, pero que queren explorar libros e poesía, conectarse cun autor, e facer preguntas un a un.<br/><br/>Custo<br/><br/>Ofrezo visitas de 30-45 minutos de Zoom ou Skype con escolas por 125 dólares por sesión (ou 200 dólares por dúas sesións que ocorren dentro de tres horas pola mañá ou pola tarde; 325 dólares por tres sesións nun día; 425 dólares por catro sesións nun día). En cada sesión, intento involucrar aos nenos o máis activamente posible. Non, non é o mesmo tipo de conexión que ofrece unha visita en persoa, pero aínda pode ser inspirador e motivador para os nenos!<br/><br/>O que fago<br/><br/>Cada sesión, para un máximo de 50 alumnos, inclúe:<br/><br/>5 Minutos de Tecnoloxía<br/><br/>3 segmentos de 10ish-minutos cada un - Vostede elixe entre:<br/><br/>Como me convertín en escritor<br/><br/>Escribir este libro en particular (elixe en que libro me centro)<br/><br/>Lendo (leo algúns poemas e os nenos axúdanme a ler outros)<br/><br/>Presentación en clase (os teus alumnos fixeron unha lectura ou actuación para min, un público moi apreciado!)<br/><br/>Escribir un poema xuntos<br/><br/>Sesión de preguntas e respostas<br/><br/>5 minutos de despedidas e despedidas<br/><br/>Tamén falo con clases de profesores pre-servizo ou grupos de profesores en servizo sobre poesía e escritura.<br/><br/>Recomendacións para unha visita virtual<br/><br/>Consellos para unha visita virtual exitosa<br/><br/>Un dos meus obxectivos para as visitas á escola virtual é capturar a interactividade que fai que as visitas en persoa sexan exitosas e divertidas. Pero a verdade é que ás veces é difícil ser virtualmente interactivo! O tempo pode non sincronizarse correctamente, o que fai que ler xuntos sexa un desafío, e é realmente difícil para min escoitar aos estudantes individuais a menos que cheguen e falen directamente no micrófono / ordenador. Pero despois dalgún intento e erro, atopei algunhas formas de ter as mellores visitas virtuais posibles. Aquí están: 10 formas de facer a miña visita cos teus estudantes unha gran experiencia!<br/><br/>Antes da visita<br/><br/>Fai que os nenos se emocionen o máis posible coa visita. Visita o meu sitio web con eles. Le algúns dos meus libros con eles. Reúne algunhas preguntas que os estudantes teñen para min. Calquera cousa que faga antes de tempo para facelo sentir como un gran negocio vai ir un longo camiño cara ao compromiso do alumno.<br/><br/>Posicione a cámara de vídeo ou o portátil con webcam para que poida ver o maior número posible de espectadores. É difícil avaliar o compromiso dos estudantes cando só podo ver un par de estudantes.<br/><br/>Limite cada grupo a 50 estudantes. É incriblemente difícil involucrar a grupos grandes a través de vídeo.<br/><br/>Vou pasar rapidamente de tema a tema ou poema a poema. Por favor, lembre aos estudantes que terán que escoitar atentamente para entender o que está pasando.<br/><br/>De cando en vez, fago un pouco de Reader's Theater cos estudantes. Se vos mando algunhas pezas escritas para o alumnado con antelación, imprime unha copia para cada sesión e córtaas en anacos, se é necesario.<br/><br/>Durante a visita<br/><br/>Cando eu discutir un libro, se ten ese libro impreso, por favor, mantén-lo para que os estudantes vexan.<br/><br/>Vostede é o meu representante. A miúdo non podo chamar aos estudantes e escoitar respostas individuais. Así que podería dicir: "Imos ter tres ideas. Levanta a man se tes unha idea". Entón vostede toma o control, chama a tres estudantes, e anuncia esas respostas a todos na sala e a min.<br/><br/>Escolla confiado, estudantes saíntes para partes do alumnado scripted (se eu enviar calquera con antelación). Durante as miñas visitas á escola en persoa, intento atraer a algúns dos estudantes menos confiados, pero descubrín que isto non funciona tan ben durante as visitas virtuais porque non podo escoitalos.<br/><br/>Fai que os estudantes con partes que falen senten diante. Cando chegue o momento, levántaos e lémbralles que falen en voz alta.<br/><br/>Nas visitas virtuais, a xestión do comportamento recae só en ti. Moitas veces non podo ver exactamente o que está a pasar, así que por favor intervén cando sexa necesario. Se hai unha gran interrupción, só me pida que agarre un momento para que non falo mentres ninguén está prestando atención:>)<br/><br/>Sintase libre para tomar fotos de min na pantalla e compartir en redes sociais, aínda que as fotos de min a miúdo parecen ridículas porque estou facendo caras divertidas ou algo así mentres leo!<br/><br/>Se tes algunha dúbida, por favor, pregunta antes ou durante a visita.<br/><br/>Programar unha sesión virtual<br/><br/>Está interesado en programar unha visita virtual comigo?

On the one hand it has prompted stigma and violence and on the other it has brought about constructive and supportive responses from various individuals and groups. A new book, Acting on HIV, edited by Prof. Dennis Francis, Dean of the Faculty of Education at the University of the Free State, looks at how drama can be used to promote vital social change as well as individual behavioural change.<br/><br/>Acting on HIV offers a systematic inquiry into drama as an approach to discuss HIV/AIDS and related attitudes and behaviours. The book is a scholarly text and includes the work of some twenty exceptionally creative authors. Contributing authors to the book include, amongst others, Proff. Hazel Barnes (University of the Witwatersrand), Rob Pattman (Stellenbosch University) and Yvonne Sliep from the University of KwaZulu-Natal.<br/><br/>"This project started in 2009 and has taken much of my time to bring together the work of exceptionally creative authors. The research that is communicated through the book is original and timely and makes a significant contribution to conversations about the role/s and significance of drama in addressing issues of HIV & AIDS," says Prof. Francis | Arquivo de noticias<br/><br/>Un novo libro analiza as formas de abordar os desafíos do VIH<br/><br/>2011-11-29<br/><br/>Prof. Dennis Francis con Marjorie Human que deseñou a portada do libro, Acting on HIV.<br/><br/>A pandemia do VIH trouxo o mellor e o peor en humanos en termos de resposta.

| Storyworld Spotlight<br/><br/>25 years of Tomb Raider<br/><br/>Tomb Raider is one of the most recognizable entertainment properties in the world. Since Lara Croft's first videogame appearance in Tomb Raider (1996), her exploits as an adventurous and quick-witted explorer have resonated widely with players, earning her a place in the pantheon of great pop culture characters. For that reason we will be putting The World of Lara Croft in the Storyworld Spotlight from December 22, 2021 to March 6, 2022.<br/><br/>Crafting a Croft<br/><br/>Lara Croft was created by studio Core Design, in Derby (UK), in 1996. The studio was looking for a lead character for their upcoming a 3D adventure game for PlayStation 1. A game in a 3rd person perspective where players would see the main character in full throughout every scene.<br/><br/>As the game was about 'raiding mysterious tombs deep under pyramids,' the lead character would need to look adventurous, and have the brains to survive complex raiding missions. After some deliberation, Lara Croft was born, a young, upper-class and utterly British woman, who was as enigmatic and intelligent as she was tough and self-reliant.<br/><br/>Success and controversy<br/><br/>Tomb Raider (1996) was a breakaway success for Core Design, who quickly doubled down on building Tomb Raider 2 (1997) and 3 (1998). A big part of the success was attributed to the games' leading lady, who found admirers both with male and female players. This baffled critics who just saw Lara Croft as a sexist cartoon.<br/><br/>Explore The World of Lara Croft in Storyworld<br/><br/>This exhibition explores the successful franchise in-depth. It looks at the history of the games and why its leading lady resonates with so many people. It also dives into the mystery of what makes Tomb Raider games tick, from the deep world building to the clever puzzles and traps, and from fantastic enemy and monster designs to the character design of the legendary heroine.<br/><br/>After all, mysteries are there to explore, and have been for the past 25 years.<br/><br/>Tickets<br/><br/>Buy your tickets for Storyworld online with a start date and entry time from Wednesday December 22.

Un xogo nunha perspectiva de terceira persoa onde os xogadores verían o personaxe principal en toda a escena.<br/><br/>Como o xogo trataba de "radar misteriosas tumbas profundas baixo pirámides", o personaxe principal tería que parecer aventureiro e ter os cerebros para sobrevivir a complexas misións de raid. Tras algunha deliberación, Lara Croft naceu, unha muller nova, de clase alta e totalmente británica, que era tan enigmática e intelixente como dura e autosuficiente.<br/><br/>Éxito e controversia<br/><br/>Tomb Raider (1996) foi un éxito rompedor para Core Design, que rapidamente duplicouse na construción de Tomb Raider 2 (1997) e 3 (1998).

| Real Estate Word of the Day: Option<br/><br/>Option: An agreement to keep open, for a set period, an offer to sell or lease real property. An option can be used, for example, to give the buyer time to resolve questions of financing, title, zoning and feasibility before committing the buyer to purchase. Options are frequently used in the land assemblage process. The option must be supported by its actual consideration, separate and independent of the purchase price of the property. Mere recital of consideration alone is not sufficient except in a lease-option in which the provisions of the lease are themselves sufficient consideration to support the option. An option merely creates a contractual right; it does not give the optionee any estate in the property. At the time the option is signed, the owner does not sell, nor does the buyer purchase, the property. Although the owner is obligated to sell if given notice by the buyer, the buyer is not obligated to purchase. An option to buy is also known as a call; an option to sell is known as a put. | Palabra do día: Opción<br/><br/>Opción: Un acordo para manter aberta, por un período determinado, unha oferta para vender ou arrendar propiedades inmobiliarias. Pódese usar unha opción, por exemplo, para dar ao comprador tempo para resolver cuestións de financiamento, título, zonificación e viabilidade antes de comprometer ao comprador á compra. As opcións úsanse con frecuencia no proceso de ensamblaxe de terras. A opción debe estar apoiada pola súa consideración real, separada e independente do prezo de compra da propiedade. O mero considerando de consideración por si só non é suficiente agás nunha opción de arrendamento na que as disposicións do arrendamento son en si mesmas consideración suficiente para apoiar a opción. Unha opción simplemente crea un dereito contractual; non lle dá ao beneficiario da opción ningunha propiedade na propiedade. No momento en que se asina a opción, o propietario non vende, nin o comprador compra, a propiedade. Aínda que o propietario está obrigado a vender se é notificado polo comprador, o comprador non está obrigado a comprar. Unha opción de compra tamén se coñece como chamada; unha opción de venda coñécese como put. |
| Benefits of Carotenoids for the Skin<br/><br/>Have you heard of carotenoids? These powerful phytochemicals are the pigmented constituents found in plants that give flowers, fruits, and leaves their yellow, orange and red colours.<br/><br/>Since the 1930s, scientists have identified about 800 carotenoids and about 40 are found in the human body, including the outermost layer of the epidermis, the dermis and subcutaneous fat. The most common carotenoids are beta-carotene, alpha-carotene, lutein, zeaxanthin, lycopene, and astaxanthin. You can read more about astaxanthin here.<br/><br/>The content of carotenoids in the skin is influenced by numerous factors, including the intake of fruits and vegetables, their bioavailability from various foods, supplementation, exposure to UV radiation, air pollution, alcohol consumption, smoking and stress.<br/><br/>How do Carotenoids Help My Skin?<br/><br/>Carotenoids are some of the best-known antioxidants for the skin and they also have important functions as anti-inflammatory agents.<br/><br/>Healthy Aging and Skin Repair<br/><br/>Antioxidants are essential for healthy skin because they help to prevent free radical damage to cells. Free radical damage causes premature aging and the onset of various types of skin cancers. Carotenoids, along with vitamin E, vitamin C, and Co enzyme Q10 are important dermal antioxidants.<br/><br/>Due to their antioxidant activity, carotenoids support and encourage collagen and elastin production in the skin. This helps to increase the skin's density, thickness, elasticity, and firmness. Collagen and elastin decrease as we age, so getting enough carotenoids in the diet and topically is critical for aging well.<br/><br/>Carotenoids can improve the signs of photoaging, skin discolouration, elasticity, hydration, texture, and can reduce transepidermal water loss.<br/><br/>Astaxanthin in particular stimulates fibroblasts to produce collagen and elastin, inhibits the activity of the enzymes that breakdown collagen and elastin, and shows anti-inflammatory and UV-filtering effects. It has been shown to reduce melanin in the skin, which results in the decrease in the appearance of freckles and melasma.<br/><br/>Anti-acne activity: the anti-inflammatory activity of carotenoids helps to dampen the inflammation and irritation associated with acne. Carotenoids also help to normalize and balance oil secretions from the sebaceous glands. They are valuable agents in skin repair and they stimulate epidermal regeneration, helping to smooth and soften skin.<br/><br/>Where Can I Find Carotenoids?<br/><br/>There are two ways to get your daily dose of carotenoids: through diet and through topical application. The combination of both is the ideal approach to well-aging skincare.<br/><br/>Carotenoids are fat-soluble, so your body needs fat to absorb them (think tomatoes and olive oil, broccoli and butter, or spinach and avocado). Common sources of carotenoids in food are avocado, egg yolks, kale, spinach, carrots, sweet potatoes, papaya, and tomatoes.<br/><br/>While we advocate getting as many of your nutrients and antioxidants as you can from food rather than supplementation; one study showed that astaxanthin combined with collagen hydrolysate significantly improved barrier integrity, reduced transepidermal water loss, and increased the expression of procollagen type I mRNA.<br/><br/>Topical application is key to healthy skin. Studies show that high concentrations of antioxidants in human skin offer the best protection for healthy skin at any age.<br/><br/>At Sarka Botanicals, we blend carotenoid-rich, whole plants such as calendula, dandelion, and extracts like astaxanthin with cold-pressed oils and functional ingredients. Calendula alone contains over 19 different types of carotenoids. This may explain why it has such a long history of use in skin care. Studies show that carotenoids blended with co-enzyme Q10 are especially effective at reducing inflammation and slowing premature skin aging due to sun exposure. | Beneficios dos carotenoides para a pel<br/><br/>Xa escoitou falar dos carotenoides? Estes poderosos fitoquímicos son os constituíntes pigmentados que se atopan nas plantas que dan flores, froitos e deixan as súas cores amarelas, laranxas e vermellas.<br/><br/>Desde a década de 1930, os científicos identificaron preto de 800 carotenoides e ao redor de 40 atópanse no corpo humano, incluíndo a capa máis externa da epiderme, a derme e a graxa subcutánea. Os carotenoides máis comúns son o beta-caroteno, o alfa-caroteno, a luteína, a zeaxantina, o licopeno e a astaxantina. Podes ler máis sobre a astaxantina aquí.<br/><br/>O contido de carotenoides na pel está influenciado por numerosos factores, incluíndo a inxestión de froitas e verduras, a súa biodispoñibilidade de varios alimentos, a suplementación, a exposición á radiación UV, a contaminación do aire, o consumo de alcol, o tabaquismo e o estrés.<br/><br/>Como axudan os carotenoides á miña pel?<br/><br/>Os carotenoides son algúns dos antioxidantes máis coñecidos para a pel e tamén teñen funcións importantes como axentes antiinflamatorios.<br/><br/>Envellecemento saudable e reparación da pel<br/><br/>Os antioxidantes son esenciais para unha pel saudable porque axudan a previr o dano dos radicais libres ás células. O dano dos radicais libres causa o envellecemento prematuro e a aparición de varios tipos de cancros de pel. Os carotenoides, xunto coa vitamina E, a vitamina C e o encima Co Q10 son importantes antioxidantes dérmicos.<br/><br/>Debido á súa actividade antioxidante, os carotenoides apoian e estimulan a produción de coláxeno e elastina na pel. Isto axuda a aumentar a densidade, grosor, elasticidade e firmeza da pel. O coláxeno e a elastina diminúen a medida que envellecemos, polo que obter suficientes carotenoides na dieta e tópicamente é crítico para envellecer ben.<br/><br/>Os carotenoides poden mellorar os signos de fotoenvellecemento, decoloración da pel, elasticidade, hidratación, textura e poden reducir a perda de auga transepidérmica.<br/><br/>A astaxantina, en particular, estimula os fibroblastos para producir coláxeno e elastina, inhibe a actividade dos encimas que degradan o coláxeno e a elastina, e mostra efectos antiinflamatorios e filtrantes UV. Demostrouse que reduce a melanina na pel, o que resulta na diminución da aparición de sardas e melasma.<br/><br/>Actividade anti-acne: a actividade anti-inflamatoria dos carotenoides axuda a amortiguar a inflamación e a irritación asociada co acne. Os carotenoides tamén axudan a normalizar e equilibrar as secrecións de aceite das glándulas sebáceas. Son axentes valiosos na reparación da pel e estimulan a rexeneración epidérmica, axudando a suavizar e suavizar a pel.<br/><br/>Onde podo atopar carotenoides?<br/><br/>Hai dúas formas de obter a súa dose diaria de carotenoides: a través da dieta e a través da aplicación tópica. A combinación de ambos é o enfoque ideal para o coidado da pel ben envellecido.<br/><br/>Os carotenoides son liposolubles, polo que o corpo necesita graxa para absorbelos (pense en tomates e aceite de oliva, brócoli e manteiga, ou espinacas e aguacate). As fontes comúns de carotenoides nos alimentos son o aguacate, as xemas de ovo, a couve, as espinacas, as cenorias, as patacas doces, a papaia e os tomates.<br/><br/>Mentres defendemos a obtención de tantos dos seus nutrientes e antioxidantes como pode a partir de alimentos en lugar de suplementación; un estudo mostrou que a astaxantina combinada co coláxeno hidrolizado mellorou significativamente a integridade da barreira, reduciu a perda de auga transepidérmica e aumentou a expresión do ARNm procoláxeno tipo I.<br/><br/>A aplicación tópica é clave para unha pel saudable. Os estudos mostran que as altas concentracións de antioxidantes na pel humana ofrecen a mellor protección para unha pel sa a calquera idade.<br/><br/>En Sarka Botanicals, mesturamos plantas enteiras ricas en carotenoides como a caléndula, o dente de león e extractos como a astaxantina con aceites prensados en frío e ingredientes funcionais. Isto pode explicar por que ten unha longa historia de uso no coidado da pel. Estudos mostran que os carotenoides mesturados co coenzima Q10 son especialmente eficaces para reducir a inflamación e retardar o envellecemento prematuro da pel debido á exposición ao sol. |
