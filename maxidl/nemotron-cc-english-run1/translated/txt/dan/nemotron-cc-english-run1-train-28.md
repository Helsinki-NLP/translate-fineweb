| There is a well known quote by Plato who once said: "I would teach children music, physics and philosophy, but most importantly music for the patterns in music and all the arts are the keys to learning.<br/><br/>Whatever your religion or culture music will always play and important part. It often defines what is essentially unique about a particular group of people and helps to create a sense of community. Dr Shinichi Suzuki describes his teaching this way: 'Teaching music is not my main purpose. I want to make good citizens. If a child hears fine music from the day of his birth and learns to play it himself, he develops sensitivity, discipline and endurance. He gets a beautiful heart. Along with improving self-esteem and self-expression their are also benefits that include increasing memory and is believed that learning music can boost academic achievement. Although the exact mechanics of this is often not understood, the belief is that learning music stimulates parts of the brain that then have a carry-over impact on all academic areas.<br/><br/>Research indicates that the brain of a musician, even a young one works differently than that of a non-musician. In the field of Neuroscience research has shown that a larger proportion of neural pathways are used in learning music as the brain has to work harder.<br/><br/>There is a link between this and improved spacial-temporal skills that help in solving multistep problems such as in the fields of maths, engineering and the arts.<br/><br/>It also provides structure and focus which may benefit other areas of learning. As well as bringing, structure, organisation and discipline which carries over into other areas of your childs life we must not forget the most important fact about learning music. It brings enjoyment and a sense of fun. | Der er et velkendt citat af Platon, der engang sagde: "Jeg ville lære børn musik, fysik og filosofi, men vigtigst af alt musik til mønstrene i musik og alle kunst er nøglerne til at lære.<br/><br/>Uanset din religion eller kultur vil musik altid spille en vigtig rolle. Det definerer ofte, hvad der er grundlæggende unikt ved en bestemt gruppe mennesker og hjælper med at skabe en følelse af fællesskab. Dr. Shinichi Suzuki beskriver sin undervisning på denne måde: "Undervisning i musik er ikke mit hovedformål. Jeg vil gøre gode borgere. Hvis et barn hører god musik fra dagen for hans fødsel og lærer at spille det selv, udvikler han følsomhed, disciplin og udholdenhed. Han får et smukt hjerte. Sammen med at forbedre selvværd og selvudfoldelse er de også fordele, der omfatter øget hukommelse og menes at lære musik kan øge akademiske præstationer. Selvom den nøjagtige mekanik i dette ofte ikke forstås, er troen på, at læringsmusik stimulerer dele af hjernen, der derefter har en overførselspåvirkning på alle akademiske områder.<br/><br/>Forskning viser, at en musikers hjerne, selv en ung, fungerer anderledes end en ikke-musikers. Inden for neurovidenskab har forskning vist, at en større andel af neurale veje bruges til at lære musik, da hjernen skal arbejde hårdere.<br/><br/>Der er en sammenhæng mellem dette og forbedrede rumlige-temporale færdigheder, der hjælper med at løse multistep problemer som inden for matematik, teknik og kunst.<br/><br/>Det giver også struktur og fokus, som kan gavne andre områder af læring. Udover at bringe struktur, organisation og disciplin ind i andre områder af dit barns liv, må vi ikke glemme det vigtigste ved at lære musik. Det giver nydelse og en følelse af sjov. |

| Breaking out of the Box Fay Tsitou investigates moving objects in British museums<br/><br/>Objects are the main 'protagonists' in two different fields: museums and puppetry. In both cases, the objects enable us to interact with our surroundings, our past, and our inner self.<br/><br/>Museum visitors perceive a vast majority of the museum objects from a distance, while these remain mainly static and mute in or outside the galleries' showcases. On the other hand, puppet theatre audiences join the world of moving objects/puppets that are often literally given a voice (sound or speech). Nevertheless, is there a common ground of static and moving objects worth exploring in these contexts?<br/><br/>Museum Puppetry Research<br/><br/>Museum puppetry adopts the language of puppetry within museum exhibitions. It aims at investigating the interaction among museum visitors, objects' stories, exhibits' histories and exhibitions' narratives. It examines how object-centred activities discretely disguise their visitor-centred identity while they enable visitors to free their mind and heart from possible inhibitions or preconceptions. Museum puppetry is a type of museum learning activity, similar to and often combined with museum theatre. However, as G.B. Shaw might say, 'the actor in his primitive form' (i.e. the puppet) unblocks the audiences' imagination which '…plays a far greater part than the exertions of the actors'.<br/><br/>Museum puppetry examples in UK<br/><br/>There are a number of variables that characterise a museum puppetry activity, such as the type of museum, the type of puppetry, the target group, the activity area in the museum, the degree of interaction among the four units (participants, exhibits/collections, puppets, practitioners), the use of verbal and/or object language. For instance, one type of activity could be a complete show around a museum's performing object, as for example in the Keswick museum in Cumbria where Ali Mc Caw presented a wayang kulit style performance, The Musical Stonemason. The show combined shadow and table-top puppetry with a gamelan orchestra which incorporated a museum object, the musical stone of Skiddaw. Moreover, shows can be related to an exhibit's narrative. For example Professor Geoff Felix's popular Punch and Judy street puppet theatre show was presented in the garden of the Geoffrey Museum and at the Museum of London as part of the Victoria Street exhibit (It is no surprise to learn that Felix's beautifully crafted booth was once mistaken for an exhibit as it was standing in an open area at the same museum!)<br/><br/>Other examples include:<br/><br/>A workshop on puppet construction and manipulation - like the skilfully structured workshop that follows Anna Ingleby's shadow puppetry shows<br/><br/>A puppet workshop based on the museum's handling collection - as this happens at the Horniman Museum (London) to acquaint primary school students with the various types of puppets<br/><br/>A puppet exhibit - like the automata or the dinosaur animatronics in the Natural History Museum in London<br/><br/>Creative learning processes with the use of everyday objects - as these are facilitated by Hedsor Creative Learning, to enhance museum interpretation in places such as Sheffield Museums and Galleries Trust and Manchester City Art Gallery<br/><br/>A museum tour with the puppet as a storyteller/facilitator - like Vivien Mousdell's palaeontologist Dr. Ambrose in her puppet show Fossils Alive<br/><br/>An outreach programme - like Jill Webster's interactive puppet show Pirates! All Hands on Deck!, commissioned by Glasgow Science Centre<br/><br/>Manipulation of puppets that belong to original collections is considered par excellence a museum puppetry case - as John Mc Cormick performed with the Victorian Marionettes at the Museum Theatre in London.<br/><br/>The following cases further illuminate the multifaceted potential of performing objects in museums.<br/><br/>'Authentic' metaphors<br/><br/>For twenty-five years adult museum visitors have been enjoying Robert Poulter's New Model Theatre shows in conjunction with special exhibitions and collections, in numerous European and US museums. During Poulter's sophisticated toy theatre shows, paper figures travel smoothly in time and space while interacting with each other and their stage environment. Backdrops are changing continuously. The audience perceives the world represented on stage neither as something static, nor fragmented, but fluidly constructed moment by moment. Although puppetry favours mythological and fictional stories, Poulter makes use of his talent in painting and research skills to interpret selectively historical evidence via flat figures and settings that move vertically and horizontally. The elaborate, live montage evolves as fast and as easy, as the turning of a page. For example, during the art history show Mr Turner Gets Steamed Up, action moves instantly from Margate to London, or from the view out of Turner's window onto the canvas of his famous paintings. The liberties taken with the spoken and visual narrative are noted in detail on the program of the show, allowing Poulter's beautifully crafted paper figures to stand bravely as ultimate 'authentic' metaphors on a miniature stage of History.<br/><br/>Multi-sensory experience<br/><br/>Real coffee beans, shells and cloves cover small wooden boats which sail in a Museum of Docklands' performance originally devised for visitors with the most complex educational needs. The boats' cargo can be smelled and felt as they (metaphorically) travel over the sea to London's Victorian docks in a storytelling piece entitled Over the Sea to London, devised by Emily Capstick and Alison Hale (Peoplescape Theatre). Peoplescape have been creating participatory performances in community, education and museum settings for twelve years. Taking advantage of applied theatre techniques, live music and puppetry's rich potential and flexibility, Capstick and Hale replace verbal description of the past with live action in the present. They create a multi-sensory engaging experience for an audience in-role role with the use of puppets and manipulated objects, without relying on verbal communication.<br/><br/>Popular art<br/><br/>Last year, Dr Matthew Isaac Cohen, as a dhalang shadow puppeteer performed his Ramayana in four parts with the Southbank Gamelan Players at the British Library, where an exhibition under the same title explored how the Indian epic story is retold over the centuries. Similarly to a presentation to an Indonesian audience (who enjoy a great deal of freedom in watching the popular story – spectators can move around, take a nap, leave the show and return!), the Library's audience could watch the nearly three-hour performance seated on pillows or circulating around it. During the show, the spectators could also either move towards the exhibition area to enjoy a museum experience while still hearing the superb chanting and music, or they could go behind the screen and the performers to have a drink while still enjoying the delightful puppet show from the back, viewed through a door opening. While standing in the middle, the wayang kulit Indonesian type of shadow puppetry created an intimate in-between space bridging two worlds: art and life.<br/><br/>Two remarkable cases outside UK<br/><br/>In 2002, a Brooklyn-based constructor/puppeteer, Chris Green, was commissioned to create a part of Noah's Ark exhibit in the Skirball Cultural Center in LA. His sophisticated kinetic or fully manipulated installations – interactive exhibits and puppets manipulated by the museum staff – were made of recycled materials and today attract people of all ages and backgrounds. The Noah's Ark exhibit received awards of excellence from the American Association of Museums and Themed Entertainment Association.<br/><br/>In 2001, the renowned French director Philippe Philippe Genty presented Le Concert Incroyable in the Grande Salle de l' Evolution in the Natural History Museum of Paris. High technology projections of inventive graphic designs were used and interacted with the central exhibit of the gallery: a march that consisted of large mummified animals. This puppet and physical theatre show was a composition of mesmerising images, dramatic action and chorus singing; a unique experience for an adult audience.<br/><br/>So, as we can see museum puppetry embraces a far broader spectrum of practice than might at first be thought! To perceive museums as just another sort of venue, and museum puppetry as a merely a medium suitable to attract preschoolers with their families during Christmas period, is limiting. Recognising the performing objects' potential and communicative power, some museums support their use for their activities and learning programmes year-round.<br/><br/>In fact, these are the museums that foster a close relation between the two inanimate 'soul brothers': museum exhibits and performing objects. In the hands of the experts, such interactions give an extra meaning to an old mystery: '…Inanimate objects / have you then a soul / That clings to our soul / and forces it to love?...' (Alphonse Lamartine, Milly ou la terre natale, 1822)<br/><br/>George Bernard Shaw quotation is taken from his introduction to Max Von Boehn's Puppets and Automata (Dover Publications. New York, 1972, trans. Josephine Nicoll) | Breaking ud af boksen Fay Tsitou undersøger bevægelige objekter i britiske museer<br/><br/>Objekter er de vigtigste 'protagonister' på to forskellige områder: museer og dukketeater. I begge tilfælde gør objekterne det muligt for os at interagere med vores omgivelser, vores fortid og vores indre selv.<br/><br/>Museumsbesøgende opfatter langt de fleste af museets genstande på afstand, mens disse hovedsageligt forbliver statiske og stumme i eller uden for galleriernes udstillingsvinduer. På den anden side, dukketeater publikum slutte sig til en verden af bevægelige objekter / dukke, der ofte bogstaveligt talt givet en stemme (lyd eller tale). Ikke desto mindre, er der et fælles grundlag for statiske og bevægelige objekter værd at udforske i disse sammenhænge?<br/><br/>Museum Puppetry Forskning<br/><br/>Museets dukketeater anvender dukketeaterets sprog i museets udstillinger. Formålet er at undersøge samspillet mellem museets besøgende, genstandenes historier, udstillingernes historier og udstillingernes fortællinger. Den undersøger, hvordan objektcentrerede aktiviteter diskret forklæder deres besøgscentrerede identitet, mens de gør det muligt for besøgende at frigøre deres sind og hjerte fra mulige hæmninger eller fordomme. Museumsdukketeater er en form for museumslæreaktivitet, der ligner og ofte kombineres med museumsteater. Men som G.B. Shaw kunne sige, "skuespilleren i sin primitive form" (dvs. marionetten) frigør publikums fantasi, som "...spiller en langt større rolle end skuespillernes anstrengelser".<br/><br/>Museum dukketeater eksempler i Storbritannien<br/><br/>Der er en række variabler, der karakteriserer en museumsdukkeaktivitet, såsom typen af museum, typen af dukketeater, målgruppen, aktivitetsområdet i museet, graden af interaktion mellem de fire enheder (deltagere, udstillinger / samlinger, dukker, praktikere), brugen af verbalt og / eller objektsprog. For eksempel kunne en type aktivitet være et komplet show omkring et museums udførende objekt, som for eksempel i Keswick museum i Cumbria, hvor Ali Mc Caw præsenterede en Wayang kulit stil ydeevne, The Musical Stonemason. Forestillingen kombinerede skygge og borddukke med et gamelanorkester, der inkorporerede et museumsobjekt, den musikalske sten af Skiddaw. Desuden kan shows være relateret til en udstillings fortælling. For eksempel blev professor Geoff Felix populære Punch og Judy street dukketeater show præsenteret i haven af Geoffrey Museum og på Museum of London som en del af Victoria Street udstilling (Det er ingen overraskelse at lære, at Felix smukt udformede kabine engang blev forvekslet med en udstilling, da den stod i et åbent område på samme museum!)<br/><br/>Andre eksempler omfatter:<br/><br/>Et værksted om dukkebyggeri og manipulation - ligesom det dygtigt strukturerede værksted, der følger Anna Inglebys skyggedukkeshow<br/><br/>En dukke workshop baseret på museets håndtering samling - som dette sker på Horniman Museum (London) for at gøre folkeskoleelever bekendt med de forskellige typer af dukker<br/><br/>En dukkeudstilling - som automata eller dinosaur animatronics i Natural History Museum i London<br/><br/>Kreative læringsprocesser med brug af dagligdags genstande - da disse lettes af Hedsor Creative Learning, for at forbedre museumstolkning på steder som Sheffield Museums and Galleries Trust og Manchester City Art Gallery<br/><br/>En museumstur med dukken som fortæller/facilitator - ligesom Vivien Mousdells palæontolog Dr. Ambrose i sit dukkeshow Fossils Alive<br/><br/>Et opsøgende program - ligesom Jill Websters interaktive dukketeater Pirates! All Hands on Deck!, bestilt af Glasgow Science Centre<br/><br/>Manipulation af dukker, der tilhører originale samlinger, betragtes par excellence som en museumsdukkesag - som John Mc Cormick udførte med de victorianske marionetter på Museum Theatre i London.<br/><br/>Følgende tilfælde belyser yderligere det mangesidede potentiale i at udføre genstande på museer.<br/><br/>'Autentiske' metaforer<br/><br/>I 25 år har voksne museumsgæster nydt Robert Poulters New Model Theatre-shows i forbindelse med særudstillinger og samlinger på en lang række europæiske og amerikanske museer. Under Poulters sofistikerede legetøjsteaterforestillinger bevæger papirfigurerne sig problemfrit i tid og rum, mens de interagerer med hinanden og deres scenemiljø. Publikum opfatter verden repræsenteret på scenen hverken som noget statisk eller fragmenteret, men flydende konstrueret øjeblik for øjeblik. Selvom dukketeater favoriserer mytologiske og fiktive historier, gør Poulter brug af sit talent i maleri og forskning færdigheder til at fortolke selektivt historiske beviser via flade figurer og indstillinger, der bevæger sig lodret og vandret. Den udførlige, levende montage udvikler sig så hurtigt og lige så let som drejningen af en side. For eksempel under kunsthistorien viser Mr Turner bliver dampet op, handling bevæger sig øjeblikkeligt fra Margate til London, eller fra udsigten ud af Turners vindue på lærredet af hans berømte malerier. De friheder, der tages med den talte og visuelle fortælling, er noteret i detaljer på showets program, så Poulters smukt udformede papirfigurer kan stå modigt som ultimative "autentiske" metaforer på en miniaturescene af historien.<br/><br/>Multisensorisk oplevelse<br/><br/>Rigtige kaffebønner, skaller og nelliker dækker små træbåde, der sejler i et Museum of Docklands 'optræden oprindeligt udtænkt til besøgende med de mest komplekse uddannelsesmæssige behov. Bådenes last kan lugtes og mærkes, da de (metaforisk) rejser over havet til Londons victorianske havne i et historiefortællingsstykke med titlen Over the Sea to London, udtænkt af Emily Capstick og Alison Hale (Peoplescape Theatre). Peoplescape har skabt deltagelsespræstationer i samfunds-, uddannelses- og museumsmiljøer i tolv år. Ved at udnytte anvendte teaterteknikker, levende musik og dukketeaterets rige potentiale og fleksibilitet, erstatter Capstick og Hale verbal beskrivelse af fortiden med live action i nutiden. De skaber en multisensorisk engagerende oplevelse for et publikum i rolle med brug af dukker og manipulerede objekter uden at stole på verbal kommunikation.<br/><br/>Populær kunst<br/><br/>Sidste år udførte Dr. Matthew Isaac Cohen, som en dhalang skyggedukkefører, sin Ramayana i fire dele med Southbank Gamelan Players på British Library, hvor en udstilling under samme titel udforskede, hvordan den indiske episke historie er genfortalt gennem århundrederne. På samme måde som en præsentation til et indonesisk publikum (som nyder en stor frihed i at se den populære historie - tilskuere kan bevæge sig rundt, tage en lur, forlade showet og vende tilbage!) Under showet kunne tilskuerne også enten bevæge sig mod udstillingsområdet for at nyde en museumsoplevelse, mens de stadig hørte den fantastiske sang og musik, eller de kunne gå bag skærmen og de optrædende for at få en drink, mens de stadig nyder det dejlige dukkeshow fra bagsiden, set gennem en døråbning. Mens de stod i midten, skabte den indonesiske type skyggedukketeater en intim mellemrum mellem to verdener: kunst og liv.<br/><br/>To bemærkelsesværdige tilfælde uden for Storbritannien<br/><br/>I 2002 blev en Brooklyn-baseret konstruktør / puppeteer, Chris Green, bestilt til at skabe en del af Noahs Ark udstilling i Skirball Cultural Center i LA. Hans sofistikerede kinetiske eller fuldt manipulerede installationer - interaktive udstillinger og dukker manipuleret af museets personale - var lavet af genbrugsmaterialer og tiltrækker i dag mennesker i alle aldre og baggrunde. Noah's Ark-udstillingen modtog udmærkelser fra American Association of Museums og Themed Entertainment Association.<br/><br/>I 2001 præsenterede den berømte franske instruktør Philippe Philippe Genty Le Concert Incroyable i Grande Salle de l' Evolution i det naturhistoriske museum i Paris. Højteknologiske fremskrivninger af opfindsomme grafiske designs blev brugt og interageret med galleriets centrale udstilling: en march, der bestod af store mumificeret dyr. Dette dukketeater og fysiske teater show var en sammensætning af fascinerende billeder, dramatisk action og kor sang; en unik oplevelse for et voksent publikum.<br/><br/>Så som vi kan se, omfatter museumsdukketeater et langt bredere spektrum af praksis, end man måske først kunne tro! At opfatte museer som bare en anden slags mødested, og museum dukketeater som et blot et medium egnet til at tiltrække førskolebørn med deres familier i julen, er begrænsende. I erkendelse af de udøvende objekters potentiale og kommunikative kraft støtter nogle museer deres brug til deres aktiviteter og læringsprogrammer året rundt.<br/><br/>Faktisk er disse museer, der fremmer et tæt forhold mellem de to livløse 'sjælebrødre': museum udstiller og udfører objekter. I hænderne på eksperterne giver sådanne interaktioner en ekstra betydning til et gammelt mysterium: '... Livløse genstande / har du så en sjæl / Som klamrer sig til vores sjæl / og tvinger den til at elske?...' (Alphonse Lamartine, Milly ou la terre natale, 1822)<br/><br/>George Bernard Shaw citat er taget fra hans introduktion til Max Von Boehn's Puppets and Automata (Dover Publications.

Almost 20 years later, the challenge of ensuring women's rights remains.<br/><br/>On May 30, the UN Secretary-General's High-Level Panel on the Post-2015 Development Agenda released its report, which contains a standalone goal on gender equality and empowerment of women and girls. In addition, the illustrative health goal contains a target on ensuring universal sexual and reproductive health and rights.<br/><br/>Gender equality and ensuring universal sexual and reproductive health and rights are essential ingredients for sustainable development. We must maintain the momentum gained on these issues in the high-level panel through to the final deliberations at the UN General Assembly in 2014 on global goals for poverty eradication and sustainable development. Now more than ever, we need to recognise the centrality of gender equality. Now more than ever, we must end gender inequality as the grand objective of the 21st century.<br/><br/>Promoting gender equality in the post-2015 agenda includes finishing the work that the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) started. Unfortunately, the MDGs that are most off-track are those directly linked to achieving gender equality, such as reducing maternal mortality and ensuring universal reproductive health and rights. There is by now overwhelming evidence that gender inequality severely constrains women's independence and freedom, control over their own bodies, sexuality and childbearing, and restricts their life choices and opportunities in terms of education and work. There is also abundant evidence that it significantly slows economic growth in both rich and poor countries.<br/><br/>Across the world, in all societies, women and girls consistently face a range of barriers to equality - such as wage gaps, gender-based violence, child marriage and female genital mutilation. The poor and otherwise socially disadvantaged are further marginalised through crippling combinations of gender discrimination and poverty discrimination. Therefore, tackling the gender inequalities and critical barriers that prevent women and girls from exercising their rights and empowering themselves must be at the heart of our efforts to create sustainable, prosperous and resilient societies.<br/><br/>Achieving gender equality - including women's rights, women's health and women's empowerment - is not only a means to eradicating poverty and achieving sustainable development, it is an important end in itself.<br/><br/>Landmark documents such as the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development, and the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action have long established that women's rights are human rights. CEDAW, established in 1979 and ratified by almost every country in the world, places responsibility for ensuring equal rights for men and women with the state. Women must be offered the same access to all aspects of life as men in order to reach equal status.<br/><br/>We have not achieved this yet. Therefore, we are recommending that the UN General Assembly consider effectively tackling this challenge, and the unfinished business of the MDGs, by ensuring that gender equality and sexual and reproductive health are at the centre of the post-2015 development agenda, with relevant goals, targets and indicators approved.<br/><br/>This proposal has strong support among a wide range of stakeholders and development actors, including many governments, multilateral agencies and civil society organisations. The respective national, regional and global thematic consultations on health, inequalities and education in the post-2015 agenda, as well as the Rio+20 outcome document's framework for action and follow-up, have all stressed the centrality of gender equality and women's empowerment.<br/><br/>The MDGs created an unprecedented mobilisation of political will and resources in recent years, not least around MDGs 4 and 5 related to reducing maternal and infant death. Both of these goals are inextricably linked to gender equality and the rights, health and empowerment of women and girls. It is essential for our common efforts regarding these to be carried over and further strengthened in the post-2015 agenda. Including goals on gender equality and sexual and reproductive health and rights in the post-2015 agenda will highlight, once again, the central role of women's rights as human rights. The panel report has given a strong momentum for these issues - now it is up to all of us global actors to maintain it, and make sure that it survives all the way to 2015.<br/><br/>We are at a decisive point in our common history when our policy intentions and actions will shape the future of human development and our planet in the face of both unprecedented achievements and persistent challenges. Let us ensure that the post-2015 agenda is truly universal and inclusive, and that the ultimate goal is a world where all - men, women, young people and children - are treated as equally worthy lens is suitable for general macro work but if you want greater subject-to-lens distance a 100mm lens will give you this at a price.

Næsten 20 år senere forbliver udfordringen med at sikre kvinders rettigheder.<br/><br/>Den 30. maj offentliggjorde FN's generalsekretærs højniveaupanel for udviklingsdagsordenen for perioden efter 2015 sin rapport, som indeholder et selvstændigt mål om ligestilling mellem kønnene og styrkelse af kvinder og piger. Desuden indeholder det illustrative sundhedsmål et mål om at sikre universel seksuel og reproduktiv sundhed og rettigheder.<br/><br/>Ligestilling mellem kønnene og sikring af universel seksuel og reproduktiv sundhed og rettigheder er væsentlige ingredienser for bæredygtig udvikling. Vi skal fastholde det momentum, der er opnået om disse spørgsmål i panelet på højt niveau indtil de endelige drøftelser på FN's Generalforsamling i 2014 om globale mål for fattigdomsbekæmpelse og bæredygtig udvikling. Nu mere end nogensinde er vi nødt til at erkende, at ligestilling mellem kønnene er det centrale, og nu mere end nogensinde skal vi gøre en ende på uligheden mellem kønnene som det store mål for det 21. århundrede.<br/><br/>Fremme af ligestilling mellem kønnene i post-2015-dagsordenen omfatter færdiggørelse af det arbejde, som millenniumudviklingsmålene (MDG) startede. Desværre er de MDG'er, der er mest off-track, dem, der er direkte forbundet med at opnå ligestilling mellem kønnene, såsom at reducere mødredødeligheden og sikre universel reproduktiv sundhed og rettigheder. Der er nu overvældende beviser for, at ulighed mellem kønnene alvorligt begrænser kvinders uafhængighed og frihed, kontrol over deres egne kroppe, seksualitet og fødedygtige, og begrænser deres livsvalg og muligheder med hensyn til uddannelse og arbejde. Der er også rigeligt bevis for, at det væsentligt bremser den økonomiske vækst i både rige og fattige lande.<br/><br/>Over hele verden, i alle samfund, står kvinder og piger konsekvent over for en række barrierer for ligestilling - såsom lønforskelle, kønsbaseret vold, børneægteskaber og kvindelig kønslemlæstelse. De fattige og ellers socialt dårligt stillede marginaliseres yderligere gennem lammende kombinationer af kønsdiskrimination og fattigdomsdiskrimination. Derfor skal bekæmpelse af uligheder mellem kønnene og kritiske barrierer, der forhindrer kvinder og piger i at udøve deres rettigheder og styrke sig selv, være kernen i vores bestræbelser på at skabe bæredygtige, velstående og modstandsdygtige samfund.<br/><br/>Opnåelse af ligestilling mellem kønnene - herunder kvinders rettigheder, kvinders sundhed og kvinders selvstændiggørelse - er ikke kun et middel til at udrydde fattigdom og opnå bæredygtig udvikling, det er et vigtigt mål i sig selv.<br/><br/>Landemærkedokumenter som konventionen om afskaffelse af alle former for diskrimination mod kvinder (CEDAW), handlingsprogrammet fra den internationale konference om befolkning og udvikling og Beijing-erklæringen og handlingsplatformen har længe fastslået, at kvinders rettigheder er menneskerettigheder. CEDAW, der blev etableret i 1979 og ratificeret af næsten alle lande i verden, placerer ansvaret for at sikre lige rettigheder for mænd og kvinder med staten. Kvinder skal tilbydes samme adgang til alle aspekter af livet som mænd for at opnå lige status.<br/><br/>Det har vi ikke opnået endnu. Derfor anbefaler vi, at FN's Generalforsamling overvejer effektivt at tackle denne udfordring og millenniumudviklingsmålenes uafsluttede opgaver ved at sikre, at ligestilling mellem kønnene og seksuel og reproduktiv sundhed er i centrum for udviklingsdagsordenen efter 2015, med relevante mål, mål og indikatorer godkendt.<br/><br/>Dette forslag har stærk opbakning blandt en bred vifte af interessenter og udviklingsaktører, herunder mange regeringer, multilaterale agenturer og civilsamfundsorganisationer. De respektive nationale, regionale og globale tematiske høringer om sundhed, uligheder og uddannelse på dagsordenen for perioden efter 2015 samt Rio+20-resultatdokumentets rammer for handling og opfølgning har alle understreget vigtigheden af ligestilling mellem kønnene og styrkelse af kvinders indflydelse.<br/><br/>MDG-målene har skabt en hidtil uset mobilisering af politisk vilje og ressourcer i de seneste år, ikke mindst omkring MDG-mål 4 og 5 i forbindelse med reduktion af mødre- og spædbørnsdød. Begge disse mål hænger uløseligt sammen med ligestilling mellem kønnene og kvinders og pigers rettigheder, sundhed og selvstændiggørelse. Det er afgørende for, at vores fælles indsats på disse områder kan videreføres og styrkes yderligere i dagsordenen for tiden efter 2015. Ved at medtage mål om ligestilling mellem kønnene og seksuel og reproduktiv sundhed og rettigheder i dagsordenen for perioden efter 2015 vil kvinders rettigheder igen blive fremhævet som værende en central rolle for kvinders menneskerettigheder. Panelrapporten har givet et stærkt momentum for disse spørgsmål - nu er det op til os alle globale aktører at opretholde det og sikre, at det overlever helt frem til 2015.<br/><br/>Vi er på et afgørende tidspunkt i vores fælles historie, hvor vores politiske intentioner og handlinger vil forme fremtiden for menneskelig udvikling og vores planet i lyset af både hidtil usete resultater og vedvarende udfordringer. Lad os sikre, at dagsordenen efter 2015 virkelig er universel og inklusiv, og at det ultimative mål er en verden, hvor alle - mænd, kvinder, unge og børn - behandles som ligeværdige linser, der er egnede til generelt makroarbejde, men hvis du vil have større emne-til-linseafstand, vil en 100 mm linse give dig dette til en pris.

| How Mobile Games Can Help Improve Sanitation<br/><br/>More than 2.5 billion people, many of them in Africa and South Asia, face grave sanitation challenges. In many of these countries, people are more likely to own a cell phone than a toilet. Therefore there is an obvious opportunity to use mobile technology to promote the use of sanitation and good hygiene in order to make a substantial impact. Mobile phones in Kenya transfer money; Bangladeshis listen to English language classes on their phones; and in Ghana, women entrepreneurs use mobiles to market their wares.<br/><br/>The growing Games for Change industry applies principles of traditional social games to address specific challenges . For example, in the UK, Channel 4 commissioned the game developer Playniac to build an online game to improve financial literacy among the 50% of young Britons who are heavily in debt. In Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, young developers have built iPhone, Android, and Javascript games based on local storylines. Pledge 51, a Nigerian developer group, recently released Danfo, a game where the user plays as a bus driver coping with dense Nigerian traffic.<br/><br/>Hattery Labs has begun to explore how games might improve sanitation practices. The typical game-players in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia are young urban males who own smartphones, but many of the communities that face the greatest sanitation challenges have less advanced technology. However, Javascript games built for Nokia S40 phones (among the most popular handsets in the developing world) provide an opportunity to send a compelling message on good behavior practices in sanitation and hygiene. A full report on how games can promote good sanitation and behavior practice is HERE.<br/><br/>Here are a few game ideas that might prove effective:<br/><br/>Soap Wars makes hand-washing an entertaining challenge where players use the soap dispenser as a weapon against dangerous germs. Sanitation Heroes engages players in the process of sanitation maintenance from capturing, transporting, and disposing of feces to reusing it as fertilizer. It features different scenarios in a memory game that prompts the player to match the solution to each different stage of capturing and treating waste.<br/><br/>Toilet Hunt introduces obstacles along the course of finding a safe place to go to the bathroom. As the player searches for sanitary latrines on a basic map, they must use the clues to decide whether the latrine is safe.<br/><br/>There are outstanding questions that the current research hasn't resolved:<br/><br/>How does the game appeal to illiterate players, who need rich visual descriptions and narratives to guide the gameplay? The need for rich imagery does not necessarily match the small, low-resolution screens of Nokia S40 phones.<br/><br/>How does the game appeal to women, who are critical participants in sanitation but don't represent the largest percentage of mobile game players? One initial idea is to frame sanitation storylines as mobile 'comic books', allowing users to scroll through an interesting narrative with subtle sanitation and hygiene messages.<br/><br/>How can the lessons from the game translate to rural areas, where there are fewer who can access it and more who face the challenges that it seeks to mitigate? Urban users might take their phone with them to their home village and share it with their friends and family, who will begin playing the game and continue to play out the game's storyline in real life.<br/><br/>Finally, how can the game measure its impact on sanitation behavior? User adoption and engagement in this context is a false metric to evaluate impact since users might play the game but have their behavior unchanged. Any solution to measure impact should combine a mobile game with other digital and non-digital applications that help users track their sanitation use alongside their game success. Local developers can work in partnership with games for change experts, community organizations, and telecommunications companies to test these approaches.<br/><br/>This report explores the potential of using mobile games to engage citizens in addressing persistent community challenges but we want to hear from you. Is this an effective way to engage target populations? Are there other ideas for how games can impact behavior change? Would you play these games | Hvordan mobilspil kan hjælpe med at forbedre sanitet<br/><br/>Mere end 2,5 milliarder mennesker, mange af dem i Afrika og Sydasien, står over for alvorlige sanitære udfordringer. I mange af disse lande er folk mere tilbøjelige til at eje en mobiltelefon end et toilet. Derfor er der en oplagt mulighed for at bruge mobil teknologi til at fremme brugen af sanitet og god hygiejne for at få en væsentlig indvirkning. Mobiltelefoner i Kenya overfører penge; Bangladeshere lytter til engelsksprogede klasser på deres telefoner; og i Ghana bruger kvindelige iværksættere mobiler til at markedsføre deres varer.<br/><br/>Den voksende Games for Change-industri anvender principper for traditionelle sociale spil til at løse specifikke udfordringer. For eksempel, i Storbritannien, Channel 4 bestilt spiludvikler Playniac at bygge et online spil for at forbedre finansielle læsefærdigheder blandt de 50% af unge briter, der er stærkt i gæld. I Afrika syd for Sahara og Sydasien har unge udviklere bygget iPhone-, Android- og Javascript-spil baseret på lokale historier. Pledge 51, en nigeriansk udviklergruppe, har for nylig udgivet Danfo, et spil, hvor brugeren spiller som en buschauffør, der håndterer tæt nigeriansk trafik.<br/><br/>Hattery Labs er begyndt at undersøge, hvordan spil kan forbedre sanitetspraksis. De typiske spilspillere i Afrika syd for Sahara og Sydasien er unge bymænd, der ejer smartphones, men mange af de samfund, der står over for de største sanitetsudfordringer, har mindre avanceret teknologi. Men Javascript-spil bygget til Nokia S40-telefoner (blandt de mest populære håndsæt i udviklingslandene) giver mulighed for at sende en overbevisende besked om god adfærdspraksis inden for sanitet og hygiejne. En komplet rapport om, hvordan spil kan fremme god sanitet og adfærdspraksis, er HER.<br/><br/>Her er et par spil ideer, der kan vise sig effektive:<br/><br/>Sæbe Wars gør håndvask til en underholdende udfordring, hvor spillerne bruger sæbedispenseren som et våben mod farlige bakterier. Sanitation Heroes engagerer spillere i processen med sanitetsvedligeholdelse fra at fange, transportere og bortskaffe afføring til at genbruge det som gødning. Det indeholder forskellige scenarier i et hukommelsesspil, der beder spilleren om at matche løsningen til hver anden fase af opsamling og behandling af affald.<br/><br/>Toilet Hunt introducerer forhindringer undervejs for at finde et sikkert sted at gå på toilettet. Som spilleren søger efter sanitære latriner på et grundlæggende kort, skal de bruge sporene til at afgøre, om latrinen er sikker.<br/><br/>Der er udestående spørgsmål, som den nuværende forskning ikke har løst:<br/><br/>Hvordan appellerer spillet til analfabeter spillere, der har brug for rige visuelle beskrivelser og fortællinger til at styre gameplayet? Behovet for rige billeder matcher ikke nødvendigvis de små skærme med lav opløsning på Nokia S40-telefoner.<br/><br/>Hvordan appellerer spillet til kvinder, der er kritiske deltagere i sanitet, men ikke repræsenterer den største procentdel af mobile spilspillere? En indledende idé er at indramme sanitetshistorier som mobile 'comic books', så brugerne kan rulle gennem en interessant fortælling med subtile sanitets- og hygiejnemeddelelser.<br/><br/>Hvordan kan erfaringerne fra spillet overføres til landdistrikter, hvor der er færre, der kan få adgang til det, og flere, der står over for de udfordringer, som det søger at afbøde? Urbane brugere kan tage deres telefon med dem til deres hjemby og dele den med deres venner og familie, som vil begynde at spille spillet og fortsætte med at spille spillets historie i det virkelige liv.<br/><br/>Endelig, hvordan kan spillet måle dens indvirkning på sanitet adfærd? Bruger vedtagelse og engagement i denne sammenhæng er en falsk måling for at vurdere virkningen, da brugerne kan spille spillet, men har deres adfærd uændret. Enhver løsning til at måle indvirkning bør kombinere et mobilspil med andre digitale og ikke-digitale applikationer, der hjælper brugerne med at spore deres sanitetsbrug sammen med deres spilsucces. Lokale udviklere kan arbejde i partnerskab med spil til forandringseksperter, samfundsorganisationer og telekommunikationsvirksomheder for at teste disse tilgange.<br/><br/>Denne rapport udforsker potentialet ved at bruge mobilspil til at engagere borgerne i at tackle vedvarende samfundsudfordringer, men vi vil gerne høre fra dig. Er det en effektiv måde at engagere målgrupper på? Er der andre ideer til, hvordan spil kan påvirke adfærdsændringer? Ville du spille disse spil |
| Sculpins, form a large family (300 species) of small northern fishes living on the bottom in both marine and fresh waters. Though primarily found in shallow waters, some species occur in depths to 1280 m. Approximately 16 species of sculpins exist from the Canadian Atlantic area. The se raven, longhorn, and shorthorn sculpin are the most popular species found in Newfoundland waters. Also known as gurnets, they are sometimes incorrectly called sea robins, grondin and gurnards, which are close relatives.<br/><br/>Sea Scallops: (Placopecten magellanicus)<br/><br/>Sea Scallops<br/><br/>They are also called giant or smooth scallops, are the most important commercial species of molluscan shellfish in Canada. They have two round shells, (with the commercial shell size ranging from 15 to 20 cm in diameter) nad are cream in color.<br/><br/>Sea scallops are found in the northwest Atlantic from the northern part of the Gulf of St. Lawrence to the coastal waters of North Carolina in the United States. In the northern part of this range, they occur in shallow water (less than 18 m) while in the southern portion, they are found in water deeper than 55 m.<br/><br/>The offshore fishery occurs on Georges Bank off the southwestern tip of Nova Scotia. Depending on the area, scallop fishing can be conducted on a year-round basis.<br/><br/>Sei Whale: (Balaenoptera borealis)<br/><br/>Too big to fit in one photo<br/><br/>14 meters; 13 tons.<br/><br/>The sei whale is often confused with the larger blue and fin whales. Its blow is similar to that of a fin whale, but lower and the sei's dorsal fin is more hooked.<br/><br/>The sei shows little of itself when surfacing, although it may poke its head out of the water, it only arches its back slightly and does not show its flukes before quietly submerging. The sei whale is all one slate gray color on top and may be lighter gray underneath.<br/><br/>Look for several blows in succession as the sei lays on the surface resting between its dives. It may be seen in groups of two to five off Newfoundland.<br/><br/>Shrimp (Pandalus borealis )<br/><br/>The little guy<br/><br/>During the 1990s, carapace length statistics of northern shrimp decreased in commercial and survey catches off Newfoundland and Labrador. Decreased growth rates caused by decreases in per-capita food availability due to large population increases, exacerbated by increased metabolic demands from higher water temperatures in the mid-1990s, appear to be the main cause of the size decrease. Fishing could have had an accelerating effect on environmentally driven decreases in shrimp growth and size by 'cropping' the largest shrimp from the population. The greatest decreases in shrimp size occurred in Hudson Strait and the adjacent northern shelf, the area which also has the highest densities and largest shrimp.<br/><br/>Silver Hake (Merluccius bilinearis)<br/><br/>Silver Hake<br/><br/>Silver Hake (Merluccius bilinearis)<br/><br/>Silver hake are members of the cod family, but are more slender and have two dorsal fins. They are dark gray with silver underparts. When freshly taken from the water, they are silvery iridescent, but the bright colour soon fades. Fish in the catch range from 20 to 30 cm in length and weigh between 0.1 and 0.3 kg.<br/><br/>Occurring from the Grand Banks to South Carolina, silver hake are mainly found on Georges Bank and on the Nova Scotia Banks, particularly on Browns Bank and the Sable Island Banks in depths of 55 to 275 m. Silver hake are generally found in the warmer waters of the Canadian Atlantic (7 to 10° C).<br/><br/>Formerly under-utilized in the Canadian fisheries and harvested mainly by fleets of other nations, silver hake were fished almost exclusively by Canadians using otter trawls in the late 1990s.<br/><br/>Silver Hake is sold in Baltimore as Lake Trout.<br/><br/>Skate (Raja senta) [smooth] (Raja radiata) [thorny]<br/><br/>An unpopular sea creature<br/><br/>The analysis of data for the St. Pierre Bank, which is to the south of Newfoundland, shows the average number of barndoor skate fell from about 0.6 million in the 1950s to fewer than 500 in the 1970s Meanwhile, smaller skate species, namely the horny skate and the smooth skate increased in biomass during the same interval. No barndoor skate have been caught on the St. Pierre Bank since the 1970s.<br/><br/>Smelt (Osmerus mordax)<br/><br/>Tiny Fish for Japan<br/><br/>Native to Newfoundland and Labrador. In the spring the sexually mature ripe smelt will leave either the sea or large lakes and travel up streams to spawn. In Newfoundland this can occur when the ice is still on many of the lakes. However, usually this occurs in March, April or May. The precise time depending on latitude and temperature, usually 8.90C is optimal.<br/><br/>It should be noted that the precise time of spawning is quite specific to the individual stream.<br/><br/>Spawning may last up to three weeks, but the peak seldom lasts more than a week. Spawning takes place at night with spawners returning to the lake or ocean by day . The length of both sexes will decrease in size as the period for spawning progresses. Two males will align themselves on either side of a ripe female. The female releases her eggs in clusters, with the milk of both males being released simultaneously. Eggs become adhesive shortly after extrusion, and attach to bottom gravel.<br/><br/>Snow Crab (Chionoecetes opilio)<br/><br/>Snow Crab<br/><br/>Snow crabs are common in the estuary and the Gulf of St. Lawrence, around Cape Breton Island and in the bays of Newfoundland, from Fortune Bay to White Bay. They are also found near Hamilton Bank off Labrador.<br/><br/>Snow crabs live most commonly on muddy or sand-mud bottoms at temperatures ranging from -0.5 to 4.5°C. In the Gulf of St. Lawrence, they are usually found at depths of 70 to 140 m, while in Cape Breton the depth varies from 45 to 245 m, and 170 to 380 m off Newfoundland. The distribution of small crabs is not well documented but they are occasionally found with the adults, or on gravelly bottoms at shallower depths. In some areas, there are indications that snow crabs move from gravel bottom to mud bottom, usually in deeper waters, as they reach maturity.<br/><br/>Sowerby's Beaked Whale (Mesopolodon bidens)<br/><br/>Where's the sexy lifeguard?<br/><br/>5 meters; 1.5 tons<br/><br/>It is also known as the north sea beaked whale, a rare whale of which little is known. It is thought to be mid-ocean whale which occasionally strays inshore feeding on squid and cod<br/><br/>The majority of whale strandings in the Western north Atlantic have occurred in Newfoundland and Labrador.<br/><br/>The Sowerby's is slate gray on the dorsal side and lighter gray on the ventral region. In adult males two teeth are often seen about one third of the way back on the beak erupted outside the mouth. The beak is around 50 cm long. One onlooker said the head looks like a thermos.<br/><br/>Sperm Whale: (Physeter catadon)<br/><br/>No jokes, please.<br/><br/>13 meters; 28 tons<br/><br/>The largest of the toothed whales is often referred to as "Moby Dick." Located at the front of its head, the single blowhole sends a slanted 5-meter misty spray out 45 degrees from its body. Its massive square head and the series of bumps that replace its dorsal fin easily identify the sperm whale It is slate gray. Sperm whales, like the humpback, will throw their tails high into the air when diving.<br/><br/>They are found offshore hunting for squid in deep water, but occasionally can be seen inshore singly or in small groups. | Sculpins, danner en stor familie (300 arter) af små nordlige fisk, der lever på bunden i både hav- og ferskvand. Selvom de primært findes i lavvandede farvande, forekommer nogle arter i dybder til 1280 m. Der findes ca. 16 arter af sculpins fra det canadiske atlantiske område. Se ravn, langhorn og shorthorn sculpins er de mest populære arter, der findes i Newfoundlands farvande. Også kendt som gurnets, er de undertiden fejlagtigt kaldes hav robins, grondin og gurnards, som er nære slægtninge.<br/><br/>Hav Kammuslinger: (Placopecten magellanicus)<br/><br/>Hav Kammuslinger<br/><br/>De kaldes også kæmpe eller glatte kammuslinger, er de vigtigste kommercielle arter af bløddyr skaldyr i Canada. De har to runde skaller, (med den kommercielle skal størrelse spænder fra 15 til 20 cm i diameter) nad er creme i farven.<br/><br/>Havskælv findes i det nordvestlige Atlanterhav fra den nordlige del af St. Lawrence-bugten til kystfarvandene i North Carolina i USA. I den nordlige del af dette område forekommer de på lavt vand (mindre end 18 m), mens de i den sydlige del findes i vand dybere end 55 m.<br/><br/>Offshore fiskeri sker på Georges Bank ud for den sydvestlige spids af Nova Scotia. Afhængigt af området, kammusling fiskeri kan udføres på en året rundt.<br/><br/>Sei Hval: (Balaenoptera borealis)<br/><br/>For stor til at passe ind i et billede<br/><br/>14 meter; 13 tons.<br/><br/>Seihvalen forveksles ofte med de større blå- og finhvaler. Dens slag ligner en finhvals, men lavere og seis rygfinne er mere hooked.<br/><br/>Sei viser lidt af sig selv, når overfladebehandling, selv om det kan stikke hovedet ud af vandet, det kun buer ryggen lidt og viser ikke sine flukes før stille nedsænkning. Seihvalen er alle en skifergrå farve på toppen og kan være lysere grå nedenunder.<br/><br/>Kig efter flere slag i træk, som sei lægger på overfladen hviler mellem sine dyk. Det kan ses i grupper på to til fem ud for Newfoundland.<br/><br/>Rejer (Pandalus borealis )<br/><br/>Den lille fyr<br/><br/>I løbet af 1990'erne, carapace længde statistikker af nordlige rejer faldt i kommercielle og undersøgelse fangster ud Newfoundland og Labrador. Faldende vækstrater forårsaget af fald i fødevaretilgængeligheden pr. indbygger på grund af store befolkningsstigninger, forværret af øgede metaboliske krav fra højere vandtemperaturer i midten af 1990'erne, synes at være hovedårsagen til størrelsesfaldet. Fiskeriet kunne have haft en accelererende effekt på miljømæssigt drevet fald i rejevækst og størrelse ved at "croppe" den største reje fra befolkningen. De største fald i rejestørrelse fandt sted i Hudsonstrædet og den tilstødende nordlige hylde, det område, som også har de højeste tætheder og største rejer.<br/><br/>Sølvhakke (Merluccius bilinearis)<br/><br/>Silver Hake<br/><br/>Sølvhakke (Merluccius bilinearis)<br/><br/>Sølvkulmule er medlemmer af torskefamilien, men er mere slank og har to rygfinner. De er mørkegrå med sølvunderside. Når de er frisk taget fra vandet, er de sølvfarvede, men den lyse farve falmer snart. Fisk i fangsten varierer fra 20 til 30 cm i længden og vejer mellem 0,1 og 0,3 kg.<br/><br/>Forekommer fra Grand Banks til South Carolina, sølv kulmule findes hovedsageligt på Georges Bank og på Nova Scotia Banks, især på Browns Bank og Sable Island Banks i dybder på 55 til 275 m. Sølvkulmule findes generelt i de varmere farvande i det canadiske Atlanterhav (7 til 10° C).<br/><br/>Tidligere underudnyttet i det canadiske fiskeri og høstet hovedsageligt af flåder af andre nationer, blev sølv kulmule fisket næsten udelukkende af canadiere ved hjælp af odder trawl i slutningen af 1990'erne.<br/><br/>Silver Hake sælges i Baltimore som Lake Trout.<br/><br/>Skate (Raja senta) [glat] (Raja radiata) [tornet]<br/><br/>Et upopulært havvæsen<br/><br/>Analysen af data for St. Pierre Bank, som ligger syd for Newfoundland, viser, at det gennemsnitlige antal barndoor skate faldt fra omkring 0,6 millioner i 1950'erne til færre end 500 i 1970'erne. Ingen barndoor skate er blevet fanget på St. Pierre Bank siden 1970'erne.<br/><br/>Smelt (Osmerus mordax)<br/><br/>Små fisk til Japan<br/><br/>Native til Newfoundland og Labrador. Om foråret vil den kønsmodne modne lugt forlade enten havet eller store søer og rejse op ad vandløb for at gyde. I Newfoundland kan dette forekomme, når isen stadig er på mange af søerne. Men normalt sker dette i marts, april eller maj. Den præcise tid afhængigt af breddegrad og temperatur, normalt 8.90C er optimal.<br/><br/>Det skal bemærkes, at det præcise tidspunkt for gydning er ret specifikt for den enkelte strøm.<br/><br/>Gydning kan vare op til tre uger, men toppen varer sjældent mere end en uge. Gydning finder sted om natten med gydere vender tilbage til søen eller havet om dagen. Længden af begge køn vil falde i størrelse som perioden for gydning skrider frem. To hanner vil justere sig på hver side af en moden kvinde. Hunnen frigiver sine æg i klynger, hvor mælken fra begge hanner frigives samtidig. Selvom æg bliver klæbende kort efter ekstrudering, og fastgør til bundgrus.<br/><br/>Snekrabbe (Chionoecetes opilio)<br/><br/>Sne Krabbe<br/><br/>Snekrabber er almindelige i flodmundingen og St. Lawrence-bugten, omkring Cape Breton Island og i Newfoundlands bugter, fra Fortune Bay til White Bay. De findes også nær Hamilton Bank ud for Labrador.<br/><br/>Snekrabber lever oftest på mudret eller sand-mud bund ved temperaturer fra -0,5 til 4,5° C. I St. Lawrence-bugten findes de normalt på dybder på 70 til 140 m, mens i Cape Breton varierer dybden fra 45 til 245 m, og 170 til 380 m ud for Newfoundland. Udbredelsen af små krabber er ikke veldokumenteret, men de findes lejlighedsvis hos de voksne, eller på grusede bunde på lavere dybder. I nogle områder er der indikationer på, at snekrabber bevæger sig fra grusbund til mudderbund, normalt i dybere vand, når de når modenhed.<br/><br/>Sowerby's Beaked Whale (Mesopolodon bidens)<br/><br/>Hvor er den sexede livredder?<br/><br/>5 meter; 1,5 tons<br/><br/>Det er også kendt som Nordsøen næbhval, en sjælden hval, som lidt er kendt.
