| Bacopa<br/><br/>19 Nov 2015<br/>Posted by Doxiderol<br/><br/>Bacopa is a perennial plant that thrives in marshy subtropical and tropical regions around the globe. The highly regarded herb is a key ingredient in Doxiderol, a nutritional supplement that enhances cognitive function. Bacopa was chosen for its ability to protect the brain and increase acetylcholine, a biochemical messenger that enables the nervous system to relay information.<br/><br/>Ayurvedic practitioners first described the therapeutic properties of bacopa in 300 BC. The physicians recorded bacopa's abilities to enhance intelligence and memory. Nearly 2,500 years later, a growing body of modern research confirms the cognitive benefits of bacopa recorded in the Ayurvedic text.<br/><br/>In 1987, researchers in India evaluated the effects of bacopa on the intellectual function of school-aged children. During the four-week study, they administered bacopa to 40 children who were 6 to 8 years old. The scientists determined that bacopa increased perception and memory. The children were able to solve maze exercises quicker and more accurately after receiving bacopa. Many parents in India routinely use bacopa to enhance their children's intellectual development.<br/><br/>A 12-week study published in the August 2001 issue of Psychopharmacology investigated the effects of bacopa on cognitive function. Scientists randomly assigned the healthy volunteers, aged 18 to 65, to receive bacopa or an inactive substance. They also used a double-blind configuration for the study to conceal the identities of the products. Researchers use this design to ensure that the test results are valid because it eliminates bias by the researchers and participants. The bacopa group experienced a significant improvement in the speed at which they were able to process visual information. The participants also learned faster and stored new memories more efficiently.<br/><br/>In 2007, a Texas A&M College of Medicine laboratory study revealed one of the mechanisms responsible for bacopa's ability to promote brain health. According to the scientists, bacopa uses polyphenols to prevent oxidative stress and the damage that it causes to healthy brain cells. Bacopa also reduces harmful deposits of a substance known as beta-amyloid, which is the primary component of the plaque in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease.<br/><br/>A double-blind study published in the July 2008 issue of the Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine evaluated the effect of bacopa on elderly patients. The study confirmed that bacopa increased cognitive performance while reducing stress. According to the authors, the benefits achieved in this study confirmed the results of earlier research.<br/><br/>A 90-day study published in the December 2008 issue of Phytotherapy Research confirms the cognitive benefits that were previously demonstrated in other bacopa studies. Bacopa significantly improved the ability of the participants to temporarily store and use information required for completing a complex task. The double-blind study also demonstrated that bacopa reduced the time required to process visual information.<br/><br/>In addition to enhancing nerve signal transmission, the scientists theorize that bacopa increases cognitive function by reducing anxiety. Numerous studies indicate that anxiety interferes with the ability to perform tasks that require higher-level cognitive functions, such as learning and memorization. Stress disrupts biochemical messengers and healthy nerve signal transmission. Bacopa alleviates stress and restores a sense of calm by increasing acetylcholine levels, which reduces your heart rate and enables you to take deeper breaths.<br/><br/>Doxiderol is a great way to obtain the benefits of bacopa. This holistic supplement also contains other natural ingredients that promote brain health and support your ability to focus and concentrate on complex task as well as memorize information. | Bacopa<br/><br/>19 Jul 2015<br/>Skrevet af Doxiderol<br/><br/>Bacopa er en flerårig plante, der trives i sumpede subtropiske og tropiske regioner rundt om i verden. Den højt ansete urt er en vigtig ingrediens i Doxiderol, et kosttilskud, der forbedrer kognitiv funktion. Bacopa blev valgt for sin evne til at beskytte hjernen og øge acetylcholin, en biokemisk budbringer, der gør det muligt for nervesystemet at videresende information.<br/><br/>Ayurvediske praktiserende læger beskrev først bacopas terapeutiske egenskaber i 300 f.Kr. Lægerne registrerede bacopas evner til at forbedre intelligens og hukommelse. Næsten 2.500 år senere bekræfter en voksende mængde moderne forskning de kognitive fordele ved bacopa, der er registreret i den ayurvediske tekst.<br/><br/>I 1987 evaluerede forskere i Indien virkningen af bacopa på skolebørns intellektuelle funktion. I løbet af den fire uger lange undersøgelse administrerede de bacopa til 40 børn, der var 6 til 8 år gamle. Forskerne fastslog, at bacopa øgede opfattelsen og hukommelsen. Børnene var i stand til at løse labyrintøvelser hurtigere og mere præcist efter at have modtaget bacopa. Mange forældre i Indien bruger rutinemæssigt bacopa til at forbedre deres børns intellektuelle udvikling.<br/><br/>En 12-ugers undersøgelse offentliggjort i august 2001 udgave af Psychopharmacology undersøgt virkningerne af bacopa på kognitiv funktion. Forskere tilfældigt tildelt de raske frivillige, i alderen 18 til 65, til at modtage bacopa eller et inaktivt stof. De brugte også en dobbeltblind konfiguration til undersøgelsen for at skjule produkternes identiteter. Forskere bruger dette design til at sikre, at testresultaterne er gyldige, fordi det eliminerer bias af forskerne og deltagerne. Bacopa-gruppen oplevede en betydelig forbedring i den hastighed, hvormed de var i stand til at behandle visuel information. Deltagerne lærte også hurtigere og gemte nye minder mere effektivt.<br/><br/>I 2007 afslørede en Texas A & M College of Medicine laboratorieundersøgelse en af de mekanismer, der er ansvarlige for bacopas evne til at fremme hjernens sundhed. Ifølge forskerne bruger bacopa polyphenoler til at forhindre oxidativ stress og den skade, det forårsager for sunde hjerneceller. Bacopa reducerer også skadelige aflejringer af et stof kendt som beta-amyloid, som er den primære komponent i plak i hjernen hos patienter med Alzheimers sygdom.<br/><br/>En dobbeltblind undersøgelse offentliggjort i juli 2008-udgaven af Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine evaluerede effekten af bacopa på ældre patienter. Undersøgelsen bekræftede, at bacopa øgede kognitiv ydeevne og samtidig reducerede stress. Ifølge forfatterne bekræftede de fordele, der blev opnået i denne undersøgelse, resultaterne af tidligere forskning.<br/><br/>En 90-dages undersøgelse offentliggjort i december 2008 spørgsmålet om Phytotherapy Research bekræfter de kognitive fordele, der tidligere blev påvist i andre bacopa undersøgelser. Bacopa forbedrede signifikant deltagernes evne til midlertidigt at gemme og bruge oplysninger, der var nødvendige for at fuldføre en kompleks opgave. Den dobbeltblindede undersøgelse viste også, at bacopa reducerede den tid, der var nødvendig for at behandle visuel information.<br/><br/>Ud over at øge nerve signal transmission, forskerne teoretisere, at bacopa øger kognitiv funktion ved at reducere angst. Talrige undersøgelser tyder på, at angst forstyrrer evnen til at udføre opgaver, der kræver højere kognitive funktioner, såsom læring og memorisering. Stress forstyrrer biokemiske budbringere og sund nerve signal transmission. Bacopa lindrer stress og genopretter en følelse af ro ved at øge acetylcholin niveauer, hvilket reducerer din puls og giver dig mulighed for at tage dybere vejrtrækninger.<br/><br/>Doxiderol er en fantastisk måde at opnå fordelene ved bacopa. Dette holistiske supplement indeholder også andre naturlige ingredienser, der fremmer hjernens sundhed og understøtter din evne til at fokusere og koncentrere sig om kompleks opgave samt huske oplysninger. |

She can also sense demonic auras as well as evil auras. When she was born and growing, however, her powers were sealed and she was much less powerful. Since the defeat of the one sealing her powers, Kagome has reached her full potential.<br/><br/>PURIFICATION By making a physical connection, Kagome has the ability to purify both poison and darkness from a subject (living and inanimate). To do so, she projects her spiritual powers through her hand.<br/><br/>SPIRITUAL BARRIERS With her full potential, Kagome has the ability to create a barrier around herself and expand it around others. It is a dome-shaped barrier that can destroy weak demons that make contact with the barrier.<br/><br/>IMPROVED EYESIGHT<br/>Kagome has the ability to see things that are often invisible to the human eye: ghosts, spirits, divine and evil auras.<br/><br/>ABILITIES WITH WEAPONS<br/>Kagome has the ability to use a bow and arrow. She has been self trained, and after years of practice, her arrow rarely misses its mark. Alongside this, Kagome has the ability to infuse her arrows with powers. She can infuse an arrows with her spiritual powers which allows them to penetrate demonic forces, destroy spells, and purify objects. She can infuse her bow with her powers and deflect enemy attacks. She has the ability to infuse her arrows with purifying energy to purify poison as well as powerful, long distant demonic attacks. And, finally, she has the ability to bypass others with her arrow: If her target happens to be behind a barrier or a hostage, the arrow can teleport and hit only her target<br/><br/>The rest of her abilities have become rather unimportant as they are related to time travel (through the Bone Eater's Well), the Shikon Jewel, or her previous incarnation.<br/><br/>the canon<br/><br/>Kagome has been pulled a few days after her high school graduation, however, before the Bone Eater's Well has opened again to allow her to return to the past permanently.<br/><br/>freestyle<br/><br/>memories<br/><br/>かごめ<br/><br/>The sound of her name was a soft whisper in the back of her mind, like a call muffled by the wind. It was the sound of a distant memory, a voice that she had started to forget but desperately clung to all the same. It was her mother's voice, twisted in the sorrow of her lost daughter. Afterall, Kagome banished without a trace. She vividly remembered those moments, the way the day had begun, what she had for breakfast and the last thing she had said to her mother. It was haunting, those memories, because it was like any other time she had slipped between worlds. She had woken, listless, because she had no purpose outside of school. She could find a job, and was scheduled for an interview that day. Her heart hadn't been in it, but it was what she needed to do.<br/><br/>She remembered the feeling of dread, sucking it up and giving herself a pep talk that she could do this. That she could progress in the life that she was meant to now that things had been settled in the past. Of course, she had the lingering feeling that she no longer belonged in her own time or her own life. Not with everything that she had left behind.<br/><br/>Kagome remembered the feeling of the wood beneath her fingers, the way her hand had curled into the handle to slide the door open. She remembered that she paused, turning to her mother with a bright and vibrant smile as she shook herself from her stupor. "I'm taking off." She remembered how strong her voice sounded, the smile on her mother's lips as her eyes shone with pride. Her mother bade her farewell, which didn't seem any different than before but somehow the weight of the words settled in heavier on Kagome's shoulders the more she reflected.<br/><br/>Briefly, the thoughts flickered forward, wondering if her mother worried over her, missed her like she did. Kagome could openly admit that her mother's strength, her support for the fact that her daughter slipped through time so frequently. There were times when she thought herself weak for not having the woman to lean on.<br/><br/>However, she remembered that she did muster up a meager amount of strength.She could remember the shift in the air, the temperature notably different than what she had expected, blinking at the sudden and unfamiliar surroundings. It was not her family's shrine. And when she turned to go back, to slip through the door she had come through, she was met with unfamiliar and cold metal beneath her fingertips and an interior that was not the entrance of her house. A man stood before her, behind a counter, who stared at her with eyes as wide as her own.<br/><br/>She didn't panic, at least. Being torn through time and placed in impossible situations at least built your willpower as far as strange happenings went. Because it wasn't every day that someone found themselves dragged into the past by a demon, intent on ripping a powerful jewel from their body that they didn't even know was there. And then there was the fact that she had shattered said powerful jewel into who knows how many pieces and was tasked on finding them. Such things were not normal, and she had needed to square up and roll with it once she realized that was her reality. It had seemed so simple, just gather the shards and fix the jewel.<br/><br/>But it hadn't been easy, there were many demons after the shards and the jewel itself. And one particularly powerful demon with a wish that he was determined to see fulfilled. To this day, she had never learned his wish but knew it had never been granted even once he had the blasted thing completed. He had ruined so many lives for the sake of nothing. Ruined so many lives for such a futile task. Naraku had been the most difficult foe, and the one who had been the center of everything that had gone wrong in all of her friend's lives.<br/><br/>But, it was that unpredicability, that necessity to roll with what was happening and the willpower that she had gained from her adventure that she remembered drawing upon to come up with a story that fit in the moment that didn't seem too whimsical or far fetched. She needed to be believed, she needed to survive.<br/><br/>Afterall, she faced worse than a man in a camera store. She had lied through her teeth to save her life before.<br/><br/>"I was looking for a job." In the end, it wasn't a complete lie. After all, she had set out of her house with the intent of attending a job interview. Her state of dress would at least attest to that much. It was one of the easier fibs she had ever told.<br/><br/>And, for some reason, that crazy man hired her.<br/><br/>かごめ<br/><br/>Kagomed rolled over in her bed as she pushed back the distant memories, refusing to acknowledge that she was really awake. She clawed at the last glimpses of sleep, begging it to return and to take her back into its embrace. She closed her eyes, willing sleep to come and was only met with memories. The echoes of a song sang in the distance of her memories, a song that had often tormented her, given the same name as her. The voice that sang was no longer reminiscent of her mother, but the voices of children who she had often played with growing up. They called back the memories, even though it had been years since she started this live, even though she was happy in this life, the call of these memories was too loud.<br/><br/>Suddenly, she was falling back into them and sleep evaded her again. She was watching herself in her family's embrace while Inuyasha was pulled back into the well, looking as startled as she had felt. The memories of that moment, those feelings, were still so strong. The feeling of heartbreak and sorrow welled up again though it had been so long since she had felt like she had been ripped away from everything that mattered to her.<br/><br/>Of course her family mattered, and she was happy to be in their arms again. She could never fully, truly describe how she had felt in those days. She still couldn't explain the way she felt split in two, with warring desires to be in both her past and present. She remembered the futile attempts to jump through the well, fingers clawing at the ground in a desperate plea to let her return. The first month home, she didn't sleep so much as she cried.<br/><br/>Elysion had garnished a similar reaction, though it was not so fierce because she didn't know exactly where she had slipped through nor did she know where she could worm her way back. Her explorations were subtle between working her job and trying to settle herself into this life. She had no intentions of staying, no intentions of lingering longer than she needed. And while she didn't try as fiercely as she had when she tried to return to the past, her passion was tenfold because she had no ties to this world. Because she was truly alone… With no hope of anyone to reach her.<br/><br/>In her irrational moments, she thought the Jewel had pulled her back and found a new hell for her to reside in. A new hell that would force her to make a wish, but she remembered very clearly that she had wished it gone forever. That didn't stop her dreams, the times when she woke up in the night sobbing. And those memories of her past were the hardest to deal with, the hardest to forget. Her heart began to race in a panic as she turned in her bed again, her breath became a struggle as she fought against a panic attack induced by her wandering mind this late into the night.<br/><br/>She hated feeling so weak, so afraid.<br/><br/>籠の中の鳥は<br/><br/>Kagome finally pulled herself from bed, her room lit with a pale light that was enough to guide her to the bathroom. She stood before the mirror, the sink running while she stared at her reflection. Raven colored hair covered her face and she felt as bad as she looked. Her first morning in Elysion was similar to this, only she was in worse shape.<br/><br/>She had found a place to sleep, managing to work out a deal with the owner of the building to allow her to stay a small period of time without paying. Perhaps it had been Miroku's influence that allowed her to strike such deals, as the monk was known for his way in charming (or scamming) people into giving them more than enough for the work they had done. The monk had always been that way, since they had first met. He would claim the dwelling of a lord to be haunted when it was not or, claim that they were subject to an attack when they would not be. He would sell his wards and charms for such high prices. It worked practically every time and she wondered why people had been so willing to trust him.<br/><br/>Perhaps it was his smile, or the fact that he was a monk that the people of the past were so willing to crumble. He never preyed on the weak, at least. He always did what was right and he was a symbol of strength to her at times when he would push through everything in order to do what was right. He pushed through the fact that he was dying, that he was cursed, and tried to do something about it rather than wallowing in his fate. He had pushed himself to the limit in the time leading up to their final fight. And she had been glad that they had defeated Naraku before he could become subject to the same fate as his father, and his father before him.<br/><br/>As far as her own charms went, however, she was more fair than her friend and made the deal reasonable. She doubted that anyone in this world would pay a hefty price for an exorcism or banishing demons. They were too technologically advanced for that. But she was clever enough, and smart enough, to make a good deal.<br/><br/>But now, Kagome was in a better place though the look on her face looked the same. Haunted, tired, drained...<br/><br/>A quick glance at a clock on the wall told her that she could try to sleep longer. But she opted out of that, not wanting to face the flashbacks again. She took a shower instead, using the cold water to chase away her demons, to fill her lungs with a sharp intake of breath and force herself awake.<br/><br/>いついつ出やる<br/><br/>It didn't work.<br/><br/>Not in the way she was wanting. The cold water certainly forced the air into her lungs, forced her mind to wake and muscles to seize. A bitter laugh was pulled from her lips as she tilted her head back and found herself remembering more. Today, she wasn't going to escape them so easily. She wasn't going to recover so simply, to recover just because she willed it.<br/><br/>Sometimes, there's no avoiding the thoughts you wanted to. Even when you were certain that you were past them.<br/><br/>Sango would have been a great help in this situation. The demon slayer was her best friend, she would even go as far as to call her the sister that she never had. An older sister who was wise, always had her side when trouble arose. Particularly boy trouble, when such things were rather trivial but it was fun to have a crush and for her friend to be mad on her behalf when Inuyasha made her sad. After all, it had been often that the half-demon would run to his dead lover's side and break her heart more than once.<br/><br/>But, Sango also inspired her in other ways. After all the woman had faced, she had always been so strong, so sure... Even in the times that she had doubted herself, she always pulled through. She admired that she had the ability to survive after losing her whole family -- the reminder of this often pushed Kagome to survive, because she lost everyone to this world -- and then having her brother become a pawn of Naraku. It wasn't easy, couldn't have been something to that just anyone could face and still go forward with. She still smiled, even with that pain and those reminders... She was often so bright, even in the darker times.<br/><br/>And right now, she wanted to lean into the older woman's side, to take comfort in the fact that she was there and she was supportive. She felt that Sango would somehow pull through this, and offer some words of strength and understanding. It was times like these that made these spells worse, the constant reminder that she was without her family.<br/><br/>"I don't want to be alone." She cried aloud in her solitude, the sound of the shower drowning out the plea.<br/><br/>She wasn't afraid to admit it.<br/><br/>夜明けの晩に<br/><br/>Another hour had slipped by before she had realized it. Her skin was cold from the water and it felt like ice ran through her veins. She hadn't realized she had begun to shiver until her hand reached to turn off the water and end her shower. Kagome didn't seek her own gaze in the mirror again, instead, she wrapped herself in towels and trudged out of the bathroom, up the stairs and into her kitchen. She started on making a light breakfast, idly reading through her notes for the day as the food cooked.<br/><br/>Her career was really taking off these last years. Her photos were featured in many galleries, her name started to frequent many lips for those who were interested in photography.<br/><br/>The job she had asked for on a whim had sparked it all. She had been far more lucky than she had expected to be in this world. Never lucky enough to slip back through the cracks into her own world, but lucky enough to do well. As she turned back to the stove, she remembered the time she had finally given up on returning home. It was about two years into her life here, as she had started to venture into photography as more than just a hobby but something she could make a name for herself with.<br/><br/>That day had been particularly pleasant, the sun was high in the sky and she had found herself taking some photos of the natural scenery. A little boy had hidden in one of the plants, and she had caught a picture of the moment his face had settled into a cheerful, mischievous grin the moment before he had jumped out to startle his prey. It reminded her of Shippou, the little kitsune she had, essentially, adopted. He, too, had been torn from his family when they had first met. His father killed and he was determined to avenge him. While young, he did seem so mature in their first encounters.<br/><br/>Maybe it had been the influence of Inuyasha that allowed the kit to act like a kid again, to be young and whimsical at times while others he was more mature. He offered comfort to her in his own way, and she tried to care for him as she would her own though she had been so young then as well. However, her youth did not stop her from understanding how to tend to him or care for him like her child. Her heart swelled when he smiled, when he had been so happy for his gift of crayons and took the time to make art. She was so proud of each drawing that he had finished that she knew that this was how a mother would feel in such a situation.<br/><br/>The pain that had ripped through her was too much, too sudden. She missed him and wanted to see how much he had grown since she had been gone. She had missed so much...<br/><br/>To spare herself any further pain, any false hopes… She gave up. And focused on bettering herself.<br/><br/>鶴と亀が<br/><br/>Breakfast tasted bland, boring, and inspired. Only after she had finished did she realized she had forgotten to any sort of spices or flavor to the food. It was too late now to remember that much, as her mind was too busy remembering other details of her life that clearly had become more important than her food.<br/><br/>"Sit!"<br/><br/>Of course, nothing happened when she had angrily yelled at one particularly frustrating client that reminded her of the half-demon. He was being particularly stubborn and rude, wanting a photo taken his way rather than letting it work out naturally. You could try to force wild animals to behave how you wanted. But, rarely did anyone succeed with force. Inuyasha wasn't as bad, however. Inuyasha had learned before she had been forced away from him. He had become gentler, more understanding, more mature though there were times he was still childish and cocky.<br/><br/>She remember how red her cheeks had burned, but how she stood her ground and fired him. She told him she refused to work for anyone or with anyone who wanted to twist something beyond it's nature, beyond it's own desires.<br/><br/>She should have compared the man to Naraku rather than Inuyasha. Though her client did not have such extreme intentions. At least the feeling afterwards was a pleasant memory. The freedom of knowing that she had come so far that she could refuse work that she didn't want to do, to be her own person that was independent of others. She could say that she made it at that point. Even though she heard rumors days later with words meant to slander her.<br/><br/>She defended herself righteously, like she did towards the end of her journey. After all, she was the only one who could protect herself in this world.<br/><br/>滑った<br/><br/>Morning light began to creep into her home, reminding her again of the passage of time. Again, she considered the list of things she had to do and debated on where to start. Or, if she should even start at all. With how the day began, she didn't know if she could consider that a great idea. It was doubtful that she would be successful with how lost in herself she was becoming.<br/><br/>She didn't want to mess up her latest work. Because she had done that on a few occasions before. It wasn't pleasant to try and recover from a complete disaster.<br/><br/>Kagome remembered the feeling of her expensive, brand new, camera slipping from her hands. She wasn't prepared to support it, because she had just removed it from her bag. Part of her screamed on the inside. A dramatic, over-the-top, full on scream that she frequently did when she was much, much younger. When she was struggling to make it through middle school while hopping between times. The other part of her had remained frozen in place while her lense completely shattered and the rest of the camera had broken along with it.<br/><br/>Seeing Inuyasha's brother, a full demon, standing before her was the last thing she expected when she had made her way out for her photos. He stood as proud as ever, as tall as ever, as imposing as she remembered. He didn't look fazed at all to be in an entirely different world, though she was never the best at reading his mind. His name on her lips was so potent, that she could remember the tiniest feelings as she did. Her lips were chapped, her mouth felt dry, and the bubbling feeling of anxiety in her stomach made her feel sick.<br/><br/>She didn't want her hopes to be up.<br/><br/>But, she wanted him to be there, even if they were not friends. They were allies, if anything, since they had fought side by side. And something was better than absolutely nothing.<br/><br/>And Kagome had the sense enough not to throw herself at him, to wrap her arms around him in relief that knowing she was not alone. Her camera no longer mattered when she approached him. She remembered that nothing else mattered for days as she spent time with him, not speaking of their world but speaking (or, she was speaking and he simply acknowledged that fact).<br/><br/>When, exactly, she fell for him though… Kagome couldn't recall. It was a subtle thing, just like he was. But she knew the feeling was there. And he let her know that she was not alone in the fact that she had fallen, that feelings had somehow blossomed.<br/><br/>後ろの正面<br/><br/>A feeling of weightlessness overtook her and suddenly her eyes opened while her mind desperately clawed for the last thing she was doing. She didn't recall when she had fallen asleep on her couch, but she knew the last place she had been was on the far too comfortable cushions. She didn't struggle, however, or fight the weightlessness as she was in familiar arms. Her head tilted against Sesshoumaru's chest, taking comfort in the fact that he was here and she wasn't alone.<br/><br/>"Welcome back." His response was a soft hum in acknowledgement. He didn't need to speak much for her to understand his intent, or the rest of what he had to say.<br/><br/>He carried her back to her bed, settled her into it with ease. Her eyes met his and she smiled easily because no more memories drifted back, no more recollections teased at her. No, whenever he was near, she never fell back into those thoughts. He had helped, and the years had helped. Today was just… One of those days.<br/><br/>"Sleep." He commanded with ease, her eyes rolled at him but she did not fight because she was tired. Her hand clung tightly to him, while she felt his opposite hand press to her forehead in assessment of her wellbeing.<br/><br/>"I'm okay," she said, her words firm with her promise.<br/><br/>She was okay. She was alive. And she was happy.<br/><br/>だあれ<br/><br/>shipper<br/><br/>summary<br/><br/>Kagome, at one point in her life, was a rather regular teenage girl until she was attacked by a demon inside her family's well house. The demon dragged her down into the well, which magically transported her about 500 years into the past. There, she learned that a sacred jewel was encased inside her body as she was the reincarnation of a priestess that had died 50 years prior to the time she was dragged into. The jewel was ripped from her body and the demon that dragged her through time was defeated by the half-demon that she freed who was pinned to the tree. Kagome befriended the half-demon, Inuyasha, in time and traveled with him to restore the jewel that she, herself, shattered. Though it was not so straightforward and easy to do as many demons and humans sought the jewel for their own purposes. She befriended a young kitsune demon, a monk, and a demon slayer who all traveled with her to restore the jewel.<br/><br/>Her group, however, was not the one to complete the jewel. Instead, an evil half-demon who manipulated the majority of the major events in most of her companion's lives. When he finally collected all the pieces of the jewel and made his wish on the tainted object, Kagome was drawn into the jewel itself with the intent of her making a selfish wish to keep her trapped inside forever, keeping the jewel alive. It was the stubbornness of Inuyasha that managed to save her from the darkness. In the end, she returned to her natural time, finished high school as was expect from a girl of her timeline. Though days later, Kagome ended up in Elysion. She has been in this world for five years, and has long since given up on returning home. She's settled happily into her new life.<br/><br/>platonic<br/><br/>It's rather easy for Kagome to make new friends, she hasn't changed much from her youth. She is a cheerful young woman who is empathetic and welcoming to most of all in her life. In her youth, she befriended demons when most would fear them. Even demons that used to eat humans, she has befriended and she changed their ways (she'd like to think). This being said, it's really easy to become her friend as long as someone is able to shown that they are willing to be redeemed, or show that they are not completely evil. She feels greatly for everyone she meets, so it's hard for her not to be drawn to others in a desire to be friends.<br/><br/>antagonistic<br/><br/>The only way to earn Kagome's wrath is to be so deplorable, so evil, and so far beyond redemption that she can't see any good in you. And she can see the good in pretty much everyone and everything. Honestly, with whom she has faced? A half-demon that pitted two lovers against each other, that cursed the entire male line of one of her friends, and then had her best friend's brother kill their family… Yeah, I don't see her hating anyone without them really, really working for it. Feel free to give it a shot, though.<br/><br/>romantic<br/><br/>When in love, Kagome is a strong support, always staying there even when things may be rough. However, Kagome is not looking for love, wasn't looking for love when she arrived so any past relationships don't exist. This isn't to say that someone hasn't fallen in love with her. She can definitely be the subject of someone's unrequited love, she'll probably be oblivious about it, though. Finally, Kagome is currently engaged to Sesshoumaru, surprisingly. I'm totally open to potential AU things, though. <3<br/><br/>fandom hell<br/><br/>age ancient<br/><br/>species space queen<br/><br/>occupation dying<br/><br/>prefers she/her<br/><br/>awards<br/><br/>pro<br/>she/her est 62woo i suck at plot replies. but ok anyway!!! neptune is very friendly and has that 'cool' persona, he's really fun to be around, and he's SUPER good to work with. like he's super patient and he'll do anything she asks of him--he's really easy to work with, definitely in comparison to other models. so i love the idea of them being all work oriented friends at first and then turning into something more. neptune definitely tries to surround himself with people, because he loves having friends, and kagome is pretty much his type too? like she's sweet and she's a strong woman, and he is actually better friends with women than he is with men, idk why, he just loves being surrounded by female friends who knows. i love my guys being super good friends and protecting their girl friends honestly. but oh M A N i love pseduo-family type relationships and neptune is an only child, so he hasn't had any like, familial relationships like that. so her looking out for him all big sister like would make him be like ????? cause he's confused but also he actually really likes that LOL! they're both good kids, i think they'd be really fun ^^<br/><br/>fandom fire emblem: fates<br/><br/>age ninteen<br/><br/>species Part human / part dragon<br/><br/>occupation representative guardian<br/><br/>prefers she/her<br/><br/>awards<br/><br/>yonder<br/>she/her aest 20 posts<br/><br/>I haven't seen Inuyasha at all but... from what I've read Kagome seems to be one of those people who might be able to help Corrin out with her emotional state. There's a lot weighing on her mind since she had to fight her birth family against her will and last time she saw them they all pretty much hated her. Frankly she hasn't worked through everything yet since she was essentially at the head of a full-scale war.

I love your idea of Kagome taking a pic of Elsa! You know, she's also a singer/performer at a local theater so I can imagine Kagome going there to scope things out and then catching Elsa backstage or something--and then the friendship could blossom from there!

Hun kan også fornemme dæmoniske auraer såvel som onde auraer. Da hun blev født og voksede, blev hendes kræfter imidlertid forseglet, og hun var meget mindre kraftfuld. Siden nederlaget til den, der forseglede hendes kræfter, har Kagome nået sit fulde potentiale.<br/><br/>Ved at skabe en fysisk forbindelse har Kagome evnen til at rense både gift og mørke fra et emne (levende og livløs). For at gøre det projicerer hun sine åndelige kræfter gennem sin hånd.<br/><br/>Med sit fulde potentiale har Kagome evnen til at skabe en barriere omkring sig selv og udvide den omkring andre. Det er en kuppelformet barriere, der kan ødelægge svage dæmoner, der kommer i kontakt med barrieren.<br/><br/>FORBEDREDE ØJNE<br/>Kagome har evnen til at se ting, der ofte er usynlige for det menneskelige øje: spøgelser, ånder, guddommelige og onde auraer.<br/><br/>FUNKTIONER MED VÅBEN<br/>Kagome har evnen til at bruge en bue og pil. Hun er selvuddannet, og efter mange års øvelse savner hendes pil sjældent sit mærke. Sideløbende har Kagome evnen til at indgyde sine pile med kræfter. Hun kan indgyde en pil med sine åndelige kræfter, som gør det muligt for dem at trænge ind i dæmoniske kræfter, ødelægge magi og rense objekter. Hun kan indgyde sin bue med sine kræfter og aflede fjendens angreb. Hun har evnen til at indgyde sine pile med rensende energi til at rense gift samt kraftfulde, lange fjerne dæmoniske angreb. Og endelig har hun evnen til at omgå andre med sin pil: Hvis hendes mål tilfældigvis er bag en barriere eller et gidsel, kan pilen teleportere og kun ramme hendes mål.<br/><br/>Resten af hendes evner er blevet ret uvæsentlige, da de er relateret til tidsrejser (gennem Bone Eater's Well), Shikon Jewel, eller hendes tidligere inkarnation.<br/><br/>kanonen<br/><br/>Kagome er blevet trukket et par dage efter hendes high school-eksamen, men før Bone Eater's Well har åbnet igen for at give hende mulighed for at vende tilbage til fortiden permanent.<br/><br/>freestyle<br/><br/>erindringer<br/><br/>Øjne<br/><br/>Lyden af hendes navn var en blød hvisken i baghovedet, som et kald dæmpet af vinden. Det var lyden af et fjernt minde, en stemme, som hun var begyndt at glemme, men desperat klyngede sig til alt det samme. Det var hendes mors stemme, snoet i sorgen over hendes tabte datter. Afterall, Kagome forvist uden spor. Hun huskede levende de øjeblikke, den måde, dagen var begyndt, hvad hun havde til morgenmad og det sidste, hun havde sagt til sin mor. Det var hjemsøgende, de minder, fordi det var som enhver anden gang, hun var gled mellem verdener. Hun var vågnet, sløv, fordi hun ikke havde noget formål uden for skolen. Hun kunne finde et job, og var planlagt til et interview den dag. Hendes hjerte havde ikke været i det, men det var, hvad hun havde brug for at gøre.<br/><br/>Hun huskede følelsen af frygt, suge det op og give sig selv en pep talk, at hun kunne gøre dette. At hun kunne fremskridt i det liv, som hun var beregnet til nu, at tingene var blevet afgjort i fortiden. Hun havde selvfølgelig den dvælende fornemmelse af at hun ikke længere hørte hjemme i sin egen tid eller i sit eget liv, ikke med alt det hun havde efterladt.<br/><br/>Kagome huskede følelsen af træet under hendes fingre, den måde hendes hånd havde krøllet sig ind i håndtaget for at glide døren åben. Hun huskede, at hun stoppede op og vendte sig til sin mor med et lyst og levende smil, da hun rystede sig fra sin stupor. "Jeg tager afsted." Hun huskede, hvor stærk hendes stemme lød, smilet på hendes mors læber, da hendes øjne skinnede af stolthed. Hendes mor sagde farvel, hvilket ikke virkede anderledes end før, men på en eller anden måde lagde vægten af ordene sig tungere på Kagomes skuldre, jo mere hun reflekterede.<br/><br/>Kort sagt, tankerne flimrede fremad, spekulerede på, om hendes mor bekymret over hende, savnede hende, som hun gjorde. Kagome kunne åbent indrømme, at hendes mors styrke, hendes støtte til det faktum, at hendes datter gled gennem tiden så ofte. Der var tidspunkter, hvor hun troede sig svag for ikke at have kvinden til at læne sig på.<br/><br/>Men hun huskede, at hun havde opbrugt en mager mængde styrke. Hun kunne huske skiftet i luften, temperaturen bemærkelsesværdigt anderledes end hvad hun havde forventet, blinkende på de pludselige og ukendte omgivelser. Det var ikke hendes families helligdom. Og da hun vendte sig for at gå tilbage, for at glide gennem døren, hun var kommet igennem, blev hun mødt med ukendt og koldt metal under fingerspidserne og et interiør, der ikke var indgangen til hendes hus. En Mand stod foran hende, bag en Tæller, der stirrede paa hende med Øjne saa brede som hendes egne.<br/><br/>At blive revet gennem tiden og placeret i umulige situationer byggede i det mindste din viljestyrke så langt som mærkelige hændelser gik. Fordi det ikke var hver dag, at nogen blev trukket ind i fortiden af en dæmon, der havde til hensigt at rive en kraftfuld juvel fra deres krop, som de ikke engang vidste var der. Og så var der det faktum, at hun havde knust sagde kraftfulde juvel i hvem ved, hvor mange stykker og havde til opgave at finde dem. Sådanne ting var ikke normale, og hun havde brug for at firkante op og rulle med det, når hun indså, at det var hendes virkelighed. Det havde virket så simpelt, bare samle skår og lave juvelen.<br/><br/>Men det havde ikke været let, der var mange dæmoner efter skårene og juvelen selv. Og en særlig stærk dæmon med et ønske om, at han var fast besluttet på at se opfyldt. Til denne dag havde hun aldrig lært hans ønske, men vidste, at det aldrig var blevet opfyldt, selv når han havde sprængt ting afsluttet. Han havde ødelagt så mange liv for ingenting. Ødelagde så mange liv for sådan en forgæves opgave. Naraku havde været den sværeste fjende, og den, der havde været centrum for alt, hvad der var gået galt i alle hendes vens liv.<br/><br/>Men det var den uforudsigelighed, den nødvendighed at rulle med, hvad der skete, og den viljestyrke, hun havde fået fra sit eventyr, som hun huskede at tegne på for at komme med en historie, der passede i øjeblikket, der ikke virkede for lunefuld eller langt hentet. Hun havde brug for at blive troet, hun havde brug for at overleve.<br/><br/>Hun havde løjet gennem tænderne for at redde sit liv.<br/><br/>"Jeg ledte efter et job." I sidste ende var det ikke en komplet løgn. Efter alt, hun havde sat ud af sit hus med den hensigt at deltage i en jobsamtale. Hendes tilstand af kjole ville i det mindste bevidne så meget. Det var en af de lettere fibs hun nogensinde havde fortalt.<br/><br/>Og af en eller anden grund hyrede den skøre mand hende.<br/><br/>Øjne<br/><br/>Kagomed rullede over i sin seng, da hun skubbede de fjerne minder tilbage og nægtede at erkende, at hun var virkelig vågen. Hun kløede ved de sidste glimt af søvn, tiggede den om at vende tilbage og tage hende tilbage i sin omfavnelse. Hun lukkede øjnene, villig til at sove for at komme og blev kun mødt med minder. Ekkoerne af en sang sang i det fjerne af hendes minder, en sang, der ofte havde plaget hende, givet samme navn som hende. Stemmen, der sang, mindede ikke længere om hendes mor, men stemmerne fra børn, som hun ofte havde leget med, da hun voksede op. De kaldte minderne tilbage, selvom det var år siden, hun startede dette live, selvom hun var glad i dette liv, var opkaldet af disse minder for højt.<br/><br/>Pludselig faldt hun tilbage i dem og søvn undgik hende igen. Hun så sig selv i sin families omfavnelse, mens Inuyasha blev trukket tilbage i brønden og så så så forskrækket ud, som hun havde følt. Minderne fra det øjeblik, disse følelser, var stadig så stærke. Følelsen af hjertesorg og sorg vældede op igen, selvom det havde været så længe siden, at hun havde følt, at hun var blevet revet væk fra alt, der betød noget for hende.<br/><br/>Selvfølgelig var hendes familie vigtig, og hun var glad for at være i deres arme igen. Hun kunne aldrig fuldt ud, virkelig beskrive, hvordan hun havde følt i de dage. Hun kunne stadig ikke forklare, hvordan hun følte sig delt i to, med stridende ønsker om at være i både hendes fortid og nutid. Hun huskede de forgæves forsøg på at hoppe gennem brønden, fingrene kløede på jorden i en desperat bøn om at lade hende vende tilbage. Den første måned hjemme sov hun ikke så meget, som hun græd.<br/><br/>Elysion havde garneret en lignende reaktion, selvom den ikke var så voldsom, fordi hun ikke vidste præcis, hvor hun var sluppet igennem, og hun vidste heller ikke, hvor hun kunne orme sig tilbage. Hendes opdagelser var subtile mellem at arbejde sit job og forsøge at bosætte sig i dette liv. Hun havde ingen intentioner om at blive, ingen intentioner om at dvæle længere end hun havde brug for. Og selvom hun ikke prøvede så voldsomt, som da hun prøvede at vende tilbage til fortiden, var hendes passion tifoldig, fordi hun ikke havde nogen bånd til denne verden, fordi hun var virkelig alene... uden håb om at nogen kunne nå hende.<br/><br/>I sine irrationelle øjeblikke troede hun, at juvelen havde trukket hende tilbage og fundet et nyt helvede for hende at bo i. Et nyt helvede, der ville tvinge hende til at ønske, men hun huskede meget klart, at hun havde ønsket det for evigt. Det stoppede ikke hendes drømme, da hun vågnede op om natten og minderne om hendes fortid var svære at håndtere, svære at glemme. Hendes hjerte begyndte at løbe i panik, da hun vendte sig i sin seng igen, hendes ånde blev en kamp, da hun kæmpede mod et panikanfald induceret af hendes vandrende sind så sent ind i natten.<br/><br/>Hun hadede at føle sig så svag, så bange.<br/><br/>Øjne<br/><br/>Kagome endelig trak sig fra sengen, hendes værelse tændt med et blegt lys, der var nok til at lede hende til badeværelset. Hun stod foran spejlet, vasken kører, mens hun stirrede på hendes refleksion. Raven farvet hår dækkede hendes ansigt, og hun følte så slemt som hun så ud. Hendes første morgen i Elysion lignede dette, men hun var i værre form.<br/><br/>Hun havde fundet et sted at sove, formået at udarbejde en aftale med ejeren af bygningen for at give hende mulighed for at blive en lille periode uden at betale. Måske havde det været Miroku indflydelse, der tillod hende at strejke sådanne aftaler, som munken var kendt for sin måde i charmerende (eller scamming) mennesker til at give dem mere end nok for det arbejde, de havde gjort. Munken havde altid været sådan, siden de først havde mødtes. Han ville hævde bolig af en herre til at være hjemsøgt, når det ikke var eller, hævder, at de var udsat for et angreb, når de ikke ville være. Han ville sælge sine afdelinger og charme for så høje priser. Det virkede næsten hver gang, og hun undrede sig over, hvorfor folk havde været så villige til at stole på ham.<br/><br/>Måske var det hans smil, eller det faktum, at han var en munk, at folk i fortiden var så villige til at smuldre. Han har aldrig byttet på de svage, i det mindste. Han gjorde altid, hvad der var rigtigt, og han var et symbol på styrke til hende på tidspunkter, hvor han ville skubbe gennem alt for at gøre det rigtige. Han pressede igennem det faktum, at han var døende, at han var forbandet, og forsøgte at gøre noget ved det i stedet for at vælte sig i sin skæbne. Han havde skubbet sig til grænsen i tiden op til deres endelige kamp. Og hun havde været glad for, at de havde besejret Naraku, før han kunne blive underlagt samme skæbne som sin far, og hans far før ham.<br/><br/>Med hensyn til hendes egen charme var hun dog mere retfærdig end hendes ven og gjorde aftalen rimelig. Hun tvivlede på, at nogen i denne verden ville betale en heftig pris for en eksorcisme eller fordrivelse af dæmoner. De var for teknologisk avancerede til det. Men hun var klog nok, og klog nok, til at lave en god aftale.<br/><br/>Men nu var Kagome et bedre sted, selvom hendes ansigtsudtryk var det samme. Hjemsøgt, træt, drænet...<br/><br/>Et hurtigt blik på et ur på væggen fortalte hende, at hun kunne forsøge at sove længere. Men hun fravalgte det, ikke ønsker at møde flashbacks igen. Hun tog et brusebad i stedet, ved hjælp af det kolde vand til at jage væk sine dæmoner, for at fylde hendes lunger med et skarpt indtag af ånde og tvinge sig vågen.<br/><br/>Øjne<br/><br/>Det virkede ikke.<br/><br/>Ikke på den måde hun ønskede. Det kolde vand tvang helt sikkert luften ind i hendes lunger, tvang hendes sind til at vågne og muskler til at gribe. Et bittert grin blev trukket fra hendes læber, da hun vippede hovedet tilbage og fandt sig selv at huske mere. I dag ville hun ikke undslippe dem så let, hun ville ikke komme sig så enkelt, for at komme sig, bare fordi hun ville det.<br/><br/>Nogle gange kan man ikke undgå de tanker, man ville, selv når man var sikker på, at man var forbi dem.<br/><br/>Sango ville have været en stor hjælp i denne situation. Dæmondræberen var hendes bedste ven, hun ville endda gå så langt som at kalde hende den søster, som hun aldrig havde haft. En ældre søster, der var klog, havde altid sin side, når der opstod problemer. Især dreng problemer, når sådanne ting var temmelig trivielle, men det var sjovt at have et crush og for hendes ven til at være sur på hendes vegne, når Inuyasha gjorde hende ked af det. Det havde jo været ofte, at Halvdæmonen vilde løbe til sin døde Elskers Side og knuse hendes Hjerte mere end een Gang.<br/><br/>Men Sango inspirerede hende også på andre måder. Efter alt kvinden havde stået overfor, havde hun altid været så stærk, så sikker ... Selv i de tider, hun havde tvivlet på sig selv, trak hun altid igennem. Hun beundrede, at hun havde evnen til at overleve efter at have mistet hele sin familie - påmindelsen om dette ofte skubbet Kagome til at overleve, fordi hun mistede alle til denne verden - og derefter have sin bror blevet en brik i Naraku. Det var ikke let, kunne ikke have været noget, som bare nogen kunne møde og stadig gå videre med. Hun smilede stadig, selv med den smerte og de påmindelser ... Hun var ofte så lyse, selv i de mørkere tider.<br/><br/>Og lige nu, hun ønskede at læne sig ind i den ældre kvindes side, for at finde trøst i det faktum, at hun var der, og hun var støttende. Hun følte, at Sango ville en eller anden måde trække igennem dette, og tilbyde nogle ord af styrke og forståelse. Det var tider som disse, der gjorde disse besværgelser værre, den konstante påmindelse om, at hun var uden sin familie.<br/><br/>"Jeg vil ikke være alene." Hun råbte højt i sin ensomhed, lyden af bruseren, der druknede bønnen.<br/><br/>Hun var ikke bange for at indrømme det.<br/><br/>Øjne<br/><br/>Endnu en time var gået, før hun havde indset det. Hendes hud var kold fra vandet, og det føltes som is løb gennem hendes årer. Hun havde ikke indset, at hun var begyndt at ryste, indtil hendes hånd nåede at slukke for vandet og afslutte hendes brusebad. Kagome søgte ikke sit eget blik i spejlet igen, i stedet pakkede hun sig ind i håndklæder og traskede ud af badeværelset, op ad trappen og ind i sit køkken. Hun begyndte at lave en let morgenmad, idet hun læste sine noter for dagen, mens maden var kogt.<br/><br/>Hendes karriere tog virkelig fart de sidste år. Hendes billeder blev præsenteret i mange gallerier, hendes navn begyndte at hyppige mange læber for dem, der var interesseret i fotografering.<br/><br/>Det job, hun havde bedt om på et indfald, havde udløst det hele. Hun havde været langt mere heldig, end hun havde forventet at være i denne verden. Aldrig heldig nok til at glide tilbage gennem revnerne i sin egen verden, men heldig nok til at gøre det godt. Da hun vendte tilbage til komfuret, huskede hun den tid, hun endelig havde opgivet at vende hjem. Det var omkring to år i hendes liv her, da hun var begyndt at vove sig ind i fotografering som mere end bare en hobby, men noget hun kunne gøre et navn for sig selv med.<br/><br/>Den dag havde været særlig behagelig, solen stod højt på himlen, og hun havde fundet sig selv at tage nogle billeder af den naturlige natur. En lille Dreng havde gemt sig i en af Planterne, og hun havde faaet et Billede af det Øjeblik, hans Ansigt havde lagt sig til et muntert, drilsk Grin i Øjeblikket, før han var hoppet ud for at forskrække sit Bytte. Det mindede hende om Shippou, den lille kitsune hun i det væsentlige havde vedtaget. Han var også blevet revet fra sin familie, da de først havde mødt. Hans far dræbte, og han var fast besluttet på at hævne ham. Mens han var ung, virkede han så moden i deres første møder.<br/><br/>Måske havde det været Inuyashas indflydelse, der tillod sættet at opføre sig som et barn igen, at være ung og lunefuld til tider, mens andre var han mere moden. Han tilbød trøst til hende på sin egen måde, og hun forsøgte at tage sig af ham, som hun ville hendes egen, selvom hun også havde været så ung dengang. Men hendes ungdom stoppede hende ikke fra at forstå, hvordan man plejer ham eller plejer ham som hendes barn. Hendes hjerte svulmede, da han smilede, da han havde været så glad for sin gave af farveblyanter og tog sig tid til at lave kunst. Hun var så stolt af hver tegning, at han var færdig, at hun vidste, at det var sådan en mor ville føle i en sådan situation.<br/><br/>Smerten, der havde revet gennem hende, var for meget, for pludselig. Hun savnede ham og ønskede at se, hvor meget han var vokset siden hun havde været væk. Hun havde savnet så meget...<br/><br/>For at spare sig selv for yderligere smerte og falske forhåbninger gav hun op og fokuserede på at forbedre sig selv.<br/><br/>Øjne<br/><br/>Morgenmad smagte kedeligt, kedeligt og inspireret. Først efter at hun var færdig, indså hun, at hun havde glemt nogen form for krydderier eller smag til maden. Det var for sent nu at huske så meget, da hendes sind var for travlt med at huske andre detaljer i hendes liv, der tydeligvis var blevet vigtigere end hendes mad.<br/><br/>"Sæt dig!"<br/><br/>Selvfølgelig skete der ikke noget, da hun vredt råbte til en særlig frustrerende klient, der mindede hende om halvdemonen. Han var særlig stædig og uhøflig og ønskede et billede taget på sin måde i stedet for at lade det arbejde ud naturligt. Du kunne forsøge at tvinge vilde dyr til at opføre sig, som du ville. Men sjældent lykkedes det nogen med magt. Inuyasha var dog ikke så slem. Inuyasha havde lært, før hun var blevet tvunget væk fra ham. Han var blevet blidere, mere forstående, mere moden, selvom der var tidspunkter, hvor han stadig var barnlig og kæphøj.<br/><br/>Hun husker, hvor røde hendes kinder havde brændt, men hvordan hun stod sin jord og fyrede ham. Hun fortalte ham, at hun nægtede at arbejde for nogen eller med nogen, der ønskede at vride noget ud over dets natur, ud over dets egne ønsker.<br/><br/>Hun skulle have sammenlignet manden med Naraku i stedet for Inuyasha. Selvom hendes klient ikke havde så ekstreme hensigter. I det mindste var følelsen bagefter et behageligt minde. Friheden til at vide, at hun var kommet så langt, at hun kunne nægte arbejde, som hun ikke ønskede at gøre, at være sin egen person, der var uafhængig af andre. Hun kunne sige, at hun gjorde det på det tidspunkt. Selvom hun hørte rygter dage senere med ord, der betød at bagvaske hende.<br/><br/>Hun forsvarede sig retfærdigt, som hun gjorde mod slutningen af sin rejse. Hun var trods alt den eneste, der kunne beskytte sig selv i denne verden.<br/><br/>Øjne<br/><br/>Morgenlyset begyndte at krybe ind i hendes hjem og mindede hende igen om tidens gang. Igen overvejede hun listen over ting, hun skulle gøre og debatterede om, hvor hun skulle starte. Eller hvis hun overhovedet skulle starte. Med hvordan dagen begyndte, vidste hun ikke, om hun kunne overveje det en god idé. Det var tvivlsomt, at hun ville lykkes med, hvor tabt i sig selv hun blev.<br/><br/>Hun ville ikke ødelægge sit seneste arbejde, for det havde hun gjort et par gange før, og det var ikke rart at forsøge at komme sig efter en total katastrofe.<br/><br/>Kagome huskede følelsen af hendes dyre, helt nye, kamera glider fra hendes hænder. Hun var ikke parat til at støtte det, fordi hun lige havde fjernet det fra sin taske. En del af hende skreg på indersiden. En dramatisk, over-the-top, fuld af skrig, som hun ofte gjorde, da hun var meget, meget yngre. Da hun kæmpede for at gøre det gennem mellemskolen, mens hun hoppede mellem gange. Den anden del af hende var forblevet frosset på plads, mens hendes linse var helt knust, og resten af kameraet var brudt sammen med det.<br/><br/>At se Inuyashas bror, en fuld dæmon, der stod foran hende, var det sidste, hun forventede, da hun havde fundet vej ud for hendes billeder. Han stod så stolt som nogensinde, så høj som nogensinde, så imponerende som hun huskede. Han så slet ikke ud til at være i en helt anden verden, selvom hun aldrig var den bedste til at læse hans sind. Hans navn på hendes læber var så kraftigt, at hun kunne huske de mindste følelser som hun gjorde. Hendes læber var sprukne, hendes mund føltes tør, og den boblende følelse af angst i maven fik hende til at føle sig syg.<br/><br/>Hun ville ikke have, at hendes håb var oppe.<br/><br/>Men hun ville have ham til at være der, selvom de ikke var venner. De var allierede, hvis noget, da de havde kæmpet side om side. Og noget var bedre end absolut ingenting.<br/><br/>Og Kagome havde forstand nok til ikke at kaste sig over ham, at vikle sine arme omkring ham i lettelse, at vide, at hun ikke var alene. Hendes kamera ikke længere betød noget, når hun nærmede sig ham. Hun huskede, at intet andet betød noget i dagevis, da hun tilbragte tid med ham, ikke talte om deres verden, men talte (eller, hun talte, og han erkendte simpelthen det faktum).<br/><br/>Da hun faldt for ham, kunne Kagome ikke huske det. Det var en subtil ting, ligesom han var. Men hun vidste, at følelsen var der. Og han lod hende vide, at hun ikke var alene i det faktum, at hun var faldet, at følelserne på en eller anden måde var blomstret.<br/><br/>Øjne<br/><br/>En følelse af vægtløshed overhalede hende, og pludselig åbnede hendes øjne, mens hendes sind desperat klodede for det sidste, hun gjorde. Hun huskede ikke, hvornår hun var faldet i søvn på sin sofa, men hun vidste, at det sidste sted, hun havde været, var på de alt for komfortable puder. Hun kæmpede dog ikke eller bekæmpede vægtløsheden, som hun var i velkendte arme. Hendes hoved vippede mod Sesshoumarus bryst og trøstede sig med, at han var her, og at hun ikke var alene.<br/><br/>"Velkommen tilbage." Hans svar var en blød brummen i anerkendelse. Han behøvede ikke at tale meget for hende at forstå hans hensigt, eller resten af hvad han havde at sige.<br/><br/>Han bar hende tilbage til hendes seng, bosatte hende i det med lethed. Hendes øjne mødte hans, og hun smilede let, fordi ingen flere minder drev tilbage, ikke flere erindringer drillet på hende. Nej, når han var i nærheden, faldt hun aldrig tilbage i de tanker. Han havde hjulpet, og årene havde hjulpet.<br/><br/>"Søvn." Han befalede med lethed, hendes øjne rullede på ham, men hun kæmpede ikke, fordi hun var træt. Hendes hånd klyngede sig tæt til ham, mens hun følte sin modsatte hånd presse til hendes pande i vurdering af hendes velvære.<br/><br/>"Jeg er okay," sagde hun, hendes ord fast med sit løfte.<br/><br/>Hun var i live, og hun var glad.<br/><br/>Øjne<br/><br/>afsender<br/><br/>Sammendrag<br/><br/>Kagome, på et tidspunkt i sit liv, var en temmelig regelmæssig teenagepige, indtil hun blev angrebet af en dæmon inde i hendes families brønd hus. Dæmonen slæbte hende ned i brønden, som magisk transporteret hende omkring 500 år tilbage i tiden. Der lærte hun, at en hellig juvel var indkapslet i hendes krop, da hun var reinkarnation af en præstinde, der var død 50 år før det tidspunkt, hun blev trukket ind i. Juvelen blev revet fra hendes krop, og dæmonen, der trak hende gennem tiden, blev besejret af halvdemonen, som hun befriede, der blev fastgjort til træet. Kagome blev venner med halv-dæmonen, Inuyasha, i tide og rejste med ham for at genoprette juvelen, som hun selv knuste. Selvom det ikke var så ligetil og let at gøre så mange dæmoner og mennesker søgte juvelen til deres egne formål. Hun blev ven med en ung kitsune dæmon, en munk og en dæmondræber, der alle rejste med hende for at genoprette juvelen.<br/><br/>Hendes gruppe var dog ikke den, der fuldendte juvelen, men derimod en ond halvdæmon, der manipulerede hovedparten af de store begivenheder i sin ledsagers liv. Da han endelig samlede alle juvelens stykker og gjorde sit ønske på det fordærvede objekt, blev Kagome trukket ind i selve juvelen med den hensigt at hun gjorde et egoistisk ønske om at holde hende fanget inde for evigt og holde juvelen i live. Det var stædighed af Inuyasha, der formåede at redde hende fra mørket. I sidste ende, hun vendte tilbage til sin naturlige tid, færdig high school som forventet fra en pige af hendes tidslinje. Selvom dage senere, Kagome endte i Elysion. Hun har været i denne verden i fem år, og har for længst opgivet at vende hjem. Hun har slået sig lykkeligt ind i sit nye liv.<br/><br/>platonisk<br/><br/>Det er ret nemt for Kagome at få nye venner, hun har ikke ændret sig meget fra sin ungdom. Hun er en munter ung kvinde, der er empatisk og indbydende for det meste i sit liv. I sin ungdom blev hun venner med dæmoner, når de fleste ville frygte dem. Selv dæmoner, der plejede at spise mennesker, er hun blevet venner, og hun ændrede deres måder (hun vil gerne tænke). Når det er sagt, er det virkelig nemt at blive hendes ven, så længe nogen er i stand til at vise, at de er villige til at blive forløst, eller vise, at de ikke er helt onde. Hun føler meget for alle, hun møder, så det er svært for hende ikke at blive tiltrukket af andre i et ønske om at være venner.<br/><br/>antagonistisk<br/><br/>Den eneste måde at fortjene Kagomes vrede på er at være så bedrøvelig, så ond, og så langt hinsides forløsning, at hun ikke kan se noget godt i dig. Og hun kan se det gode i stort set alt og alle. Helt ærligt, med hvem hun har stået over for? En halvdæmon, der satte to elskere op mod hinanden, der forbandede hele den mandlige linje af en af hendes venner, og så fik hendes bedste vens bror til at dræbe deres familie... Du er velkommen til at give det et skud.<br/><br/>romantisk<br/><br/>Når du er forelsket, Kagome er en stærk støtte, altid opholder sig der, selv når tingene kan være hårde. Men Kagome er ikke på udkig efter kærlighed, var ikke på udkig efter kærlighed, da hun ankom, så nogen tidligere relationer ikke eksisterer. Dette er ikke at sige, at nogen ikke er blevet forelsket i hende. Hun kan helt sikkert være genstand for nogens ubesvarede kærlighed, hun vil nok være uvidende om det, selv om. Endelig er Kagome i øjeblikket forlovet med Sesshoumaru, overraskende.

| Why You Should be on Twitter<br/><br/>Disclaimer: I am not, nor have I ever claimed to be, a social media guru. I'm just a person who thinks about stuff a lot, and this has come up a number of times.<br/><br/>I'm not an early adopter. Sometimes it takes me years to figure out what I want to use something for before I actually get on it, and Twitter was one of those things. I've been on Twitter seriously since about February of this year, so I'm pretty new at it. Still, I've learned a number of things, and I wanted to share them. Some people say I'm a Twitter pusher, and I am, because there's lots of good reasons to get on it, and virtually no downsides.<br/><br/>So what's Twitter? If you're on the internet, you've probably at least heard of it. It's a social media network that serves as a forum for conversations, updates, and news in a medium more public than something like Facebook or LinkedIn. Facebook is about who wants to find you, but Twitter is about who you want to find. Your favourite writers, actors, politicians, singers, and scientists are probably on Twitter. So are your favourite charities, radio stations, news sites, and stores. And they want you to find them and listen to what they have to say. Everyone on Twitter, at least initially, wants to talk with you.<br/><br/>But why join that? Why be a part of it? There's all kinds of reasons, and I'm going to give you a few.<br/><br/>People and Places Twitter is a great way to find out about events which are going on around the world, but also in your community. If you're travelling and looking for things to do, it's a great way to find out about things relevant to your interests (because the people you follow are people you're interested in). Even if you're not travelling, knowing about great places to go locally or knowing that people you're interested in are going to them creates an opportunity to meet them and create a deeper relationship with them. If you go back to my party post, all the people in it but two, I heard about on Twitter and then met in real life, and now we're pretty good friends. And the more you do this, the more things you'll find out about, and the more people you'll meet. And if you follow them on Twitter, you already know a bit about what they're like. They want you to. The reverse is also true, because tweeting invites people to see what you're like, and they can make the same choices about you.<br/><br/>Inspiration and Motivation<br/>Inspiration comes from the strangest places, and the influx of tweets means there's always fresh content for your imagination. I have a follow first policy, so I'll follow just about anybody, and then periodically go through and unfollow people. I don't know who's going to plant the seed of a new blog post or new project in me, so I like to keep my options open. Motivation also happens, because Twitter is just like life. If you surround yourself with people who are ambitious, dedicated, generous, and hard-working, it's easier to be like that, and push yourself. It's easier to think that if they can plan events, launch projects, or just get up in the morning, well, so can you.<br/><br/>Learning and Lifestyle Bloggers are on Twitter. Bloggers who aren't may actually be crazy. And people blog about just about everything. If you're looking to learn something, odds are good that somebody's tweeting about it. On top of that, news services and stores are also connected, which means that you can get your news up to the minute, and find out about sales and deals as they start.As far as lifestyle, looking for new recipe ideas? Follow some caterers and see what they come up with. Need a twist for that cocktail party? Twitter's got people for that too. Wardrobe recommendations, or just want to see what other people are doing with their lives? It's all there.<br/><br/>There are some common challenges I face when talking about this, and they're legitimate obstacles. It can seem pretty daunting, especially if you're getting on the bandwagon late, like I did. I spent months following only two people and not knowing what else to do. But there are ways to overcome them, and hear they are from least frequent to most.<br/><br/>#3: Twitter is for Narcissistic Jerks<br/>I think this comes from the idea that most people tweet for and about themselves as a way of getting attention. What I don't get is why there's anything wrong with that, or why doing that makes one a narcissist or a jerk. If someone has something to say, they want to be heard. Used to be you'd stand on the street corner and yell. Now you can yell in 140 characters or less. Twitter's just a new way to be heard. Now, there are certainly narcissistic jerks on Twitter. They're pretty much everywhere. Sometimes, people are jerks. Sometimes one of those people is me, I'm sorry to say. Don't follow those people. If you don't like what someone is saying, whether that's points that they're making or detailed accounts of their bathroom activities, you don't have to listen on Twitter.<br/><br/>#2: I Can't Keep Track of It All<br/>The second obstacle people often bring up is that they just don't have time to keep track of all the things which are going on on Twitter. And you know what? That's fine. Keep track of what you can. Maybe you only wander on every few days. If you're a private user (rather than tweeting for your company), and especially a beginner, that's okay. Part of something is better than all of nothing.<br/><br/>#1 I've Got Nothing I Want to Put Out There<br/>This is by far the most frequent challenge people raise. And it doesn't even matter. You don't have to join Twitter to talk. Join it to listen. Again, your favourite authors, singers, bloggers, and newspapers are on here. This is your chance to listen to them. It's your chance to gain a window into their lives and activities, and they're inviting you to do that. Want to find out what Felicia Day is going to be up to at the San Diego Comic Con? Done. I know people who only listen on Twitter, and that's great. That's what I did for a while. Eventually, maybe you'll find something to tweet about, or make something to tweet about. I hope you do, because I want to hear about it.<br/><br/>In short, if you're not using Twitter, I think you should be. If you're not using it to its full extent, try to. Don't be afraid to follow five hundred people, if all of those people are saying things you're interested in. Invite those people into bits of your life, and see how it's improved by the interaction. I look forward to hearing from you. | Hvorfor du bør være på Twitter<br/><br/>Ansvarsfraskrivelse: Jeg er ikke, eller har jeg nogensinde hævdet at være, en social media guru. Jeg er bare en person, der tænker meget på ting, og det er kommet op et antal gange.<br/><br/>Jeg er ikke en tidlig adopter. Nogle gange tager det mig år at finde ud af, hvad jeg vil bruge noget til, før jeg faktisk kommer på det, og Twitter var en af de ting. Jeg har været på Twitter alvorligt siden omkring februar i år, så jeg er ret ny på det. Stadig, Jeg har lært en række ting, og jeg ønskede at dele dem. Nogle mennesker siger, at jeg er en Twitter pusher, og jeg er, fordi der er masser af gode grunde til at komme på det, og næsten ingen ulemper.<br/><br/>Så hvad er Twitter? Hvis du er på internettet, har du sikkert i det mindste hørt om det. Det er et socialt medienetværk, der fungerer som et forum for samtaler, opdateringer og nyheder i et medium mere offentligt end noget som Facebook eller LinkedIn. Facebook handler om, hvem der vil finde dig, men Twitter handler om, hvem du vil finde. Dine yndlingsforfattere, skuespillere, politikere, sangere og forskere er sandsynligvis på Twitter. Så er dine foretrukne velgørenhedsorganisationer, radiostationer, nyhedswebsteder og butikker. Og de vil have dig til at finde dem og lytte til, hvad de har at sige. Alle på Twitter, i det mindste i første omgang, ønsker at tale med dig.<br/><br/>Men hvorfor være en del af det? Der er alle mulige grunde, og jeg vil give dig et par stykker.<br/><br/>Twitter er en fantastisk måde at finde ud af om begivenheder, der foregår rundt om i verden, men også i dit samfund. Hvis du rejser og leder efter ting at lave, er det en fantastisk måde at finde ud af om ting, der er relevante for dine interesser (fordi de mennesker, du følger, er folk, du er interesseret i). Selvom du ikke rejser, ved at vide om gode steder at gå lokalt eller vide, at folk, du er interesseret i, kommer til dem, skaber en mulighed for at møde dem og skabe et dybere forhold til dem. Hvis du går tilbage til mit parti indlæg, alle de mennesker i det, men to, jeg hørte om på Twitter og derefter mødte i det virkelige liv, og nu er vi temmelig gode venner. Og jo mere du gør dette, jo flere ting du vil finde ud af, og jo flere mennesker, du vil møde. Og hvis du følger dem på Twitter, ved du allerede lidt om, hvordan de er. De vil have dig til. Det modsatte er også sandt, fordi tweeting inviterer folk til at se, hvad du er, og de kan træffe de samme valg om dig.<br/><br/>Inspiration og motivation<br/>Inspiration kommer fra de mærkeligste steder, og tilstrømningen af tweets betyder, at der altid er frisk indhold til din fantasi. Jeg har en følge først politik, så jeg følger næsten alle, og derefter regelmæssigt gå igennem og unfollow folk. Jeg ved ikke, hvem der skal plante frøet til et nyt blogindlæg eller nyt projekt i mig, så jeg kan godt lide at holde mine muligheder åbne. Motivation sker også, fordi Twitter er ligesom livet. Hvis du omgiver dig med mennesker, der er ambitiøse, dedikerede, generøse og hårdtarbejdende, er det lettere at være sådan og skubbe dig selv. Det er lettere at tænke, at hvis de kan planlægge begivenheder, lancere projekter eller bare stå op om morgenen, så kan du også.<br/><br/>Lærings- og livsstilsbloggere er på Twitter. Bloggere, der ikke er, kan faktisk være skøre. Og folk blogger om næsten alt. Hvis du ønsker at lære noget, er oddsene gode, at nogen tweeter om det. Oven i det, nyhedstjenester og butikker er også forbundet, hvilket betyder, at du kan få dine nyheder op til minut, og finde ud af om salg og tilbud, som de starter. Hvad angår livsstil, på udkig efter nye opskrift ideer? Følg nogle cateringfirmaer og se, hvad de kommer op med. Har du brug for et twist til det cocktailparty? Twitter har også folk til det. Garderobe anbefalinger, eller bare vil se, hvad andre mennesker gør med deres liv? Det er der alt sammen.<br/><br/>Der er nogle fælles udfordringer, jeg står over for, når jeg taler om dette, og de er legitime forhindringer. Det kan virke ret skræmmende, især hvis du kommer på vognen sent, som jeg gjorde. Jeg tilbragte måneder efter kun to personer og ikke vide, hvad der ellers at gøre. Men der er måder at overvinde dem, og høre, at de er fra mindst hyppige til de fleste.<br/><br/>#3: Twitter er for narcissistiske røvhuller<br/>Jeg tror, det kommer fra ideen om, at de fleste mennesker tweeter for og om sig selv som en måde at få opmærksomhed. Hvad jeg ikke forstår er, hvorfor der er noget galt med det, eller hvorfor det gør en til en narcissist eller en idiot. Hvis nogen har noget at sige, de ønsker at blive hørt. Bruges til at være du ville stå på gadehjørnet og råbe. Nu kan du råbe i 140 tegn eller mindre. Twitter er bare en ny måde at blive hørt. Nu, der er helt sikkert narcissistiske jerks på Twitter. Nogle gange er folk idioter, nogle gange er en af dem mig, desværre. Hvis du ikke kan lide, hvad nogen siger, uanset om det er punkter, de laver eller detaljerede regnskaber for deres badeværelsesaktiviteter, behøver du ikke at lytte på Twitter.<br/><br/>#2: Jeg kan ikke holde styr på det hele<br/>Den anden hindring folk ofte bringer op er, at de bare ikke har tid til at holde styr på alle de ting, der foregår på Twitter. Og ved du hvad? Det er fint. Hold styr på, hvad du kan. Måske vandrer du kun på et par dage. Hvis du er en privat bruger (i stedet for at tweete for din virksomhed), og især en nybegynder, det er okay. En del af noget er bedre end alt af ingenting.<br/><br/># 1 Jeg har ikke noget, jeg vil lægge ud der<br/>Dette er langt den hyppigste udfordring folk rejser. Og det betyder ikke engang noget. Du behøver ikke at deltage i Twitter for at tale. Deltag i det for at lytte. Igen er dine yndlingsforfattere, sangere, bloggere og aviser her. Dette er din chance for at lytte til dem. Det er din chance for at få et vindue ind i deres liv og aktiviteter, og de inviterer dig til at gøre det. Vil du finde ud af, hvad Felicia Day vil være op til på San Diego Comic Con? Færdig. Jeg kender folk, der kun lytter på Twitter, og det er godt. Det er, hvad jeg gjorde i et stykke tid. Til sidst kan du måske finde noget at tweete om eller gøre noget at tweete om. Jeg håber du gør, fordi jeg vil høre om det.<br/><br/>Kort sagt, hvis du ikke bruger Twitter, tror jeg, du skal være. Hvis du ikke bruger det fuldt ud, så prøv at. Vær ikke bange for at følge fem hundrede mennesker, hvis alle disse mennesker siger ting, du er interesseret i. Inviter disse mennesker ind i dele af dit liv, og se hvordan det forbedres af interaktionen. Jeg ser frem til at høre fra dig. |
| Root Canals<br/><br/>The very thought of getting a root canal puts most people on edge. SCM Dental utilizes the latest technology and technique to make a root canal a virtually pain free and low stress procedure.<br/><br/>Rotary endodontics is an advanced technology and technique to perform endodontic treatment, the clinical term for a root canalThe term "root canal" refers to the natural cavity at the center of the tooth. The tooth's nerve is located in soft tissue (pulp) inside the root canal. If the tooth is damaged either by trauma or decay, debris can enter the sensitive root canal area and cause an infection, or in extreme circumstances, and abscess. An abscessed tooth is very serious and should be treated as an emergency, as it can create an infection that may spread to other parts of the body. If you believe you have an abscessed tooth, contact our office immediately to schedule emergency care.<br/><br/>Depending on the case, root canal therapy may require more than one visit. An initial x-ray will be taken to evaluate the tooth and root canal and determine the extent of the damage and infection if present. You will be given a form of anesthesia to make you relaxed.<br/><br/>When the area is numb, our dentist will create an access chamber to the root canal using an electric handpiece. Next, the root canal will be scraped of the infected or damaged tissue and nerve. Once the entire area has been throughly cleaned and polished, the tooth will be filled with a biocompatible rubber compound called gutta percha. The tooth is then covered with a dental filling or dental crown to restore strength and function.<br/><br/>Endodontic therapy has a bad reputation as being a painful procedure. With rotary endodontics, a root canal procedure is no more painful than having a dental filling placed. The infection and damage to the nerve is what creates the extreme pain and discomfort and patients you will experience significant relief after undergoing root canal therapy. Root canals have a success rate of 95% and allow people to preserve their natural teeth. | Root Canals<br/><br/>Selve tanken om at få en rodkanal sætter de fleste mennesker på kant. SCM Dental udnytter den nyeste teknologi og teknik til at gøre en rodkanal en næsten smertefri og lav stress procedure.<br/><br/>Roterende endodonti er en avanceret teknologi og teknik til at udføre endodontisk behandling, den kliniske betegnelse for en rodkanalUdtrykket "rodkanal" refererer til det naturlige hulrum i midten af tanden. Tandens nerve er placeret i blødt væv (masse) inde i rodkanalen. Hvis tanden er beskadiget enten ved traume eller forfald, kan snavs komme ind i det følsomme rodkanalområde og forårsage en infektion eller under ekstreme omstændigheder og byld. En abscessed tand er meget alvorlig og bør behandles som en nødsituation, da det kan skabe en infektion, der kan sprede sig til andre dele af kroppen. Hvis du mener, at du har en abscessed tand, skal du straks kontakte vores kontor for at planlægge akutbehandling.<br/><br/>Afhængigt af tilfældet kan rodbehandling kræve mere end et besøg. En indledende røntgenundersøgelse vil blive taget for at evaluere tanden og rodkanalen og bestemme omfanget af skaden og infektionen, hvis den er til stede. Du vil få en form for anæstesi for at gøre dig afslappet.<br/><br/>Når området er følelsesløst, vil vores tandlæge skabe et adgangskammer til rodkanalen ved hjælp af et elektrisk håndstykke. Dernæst vil rodkanalen blive skrabet af det inficerede eller beskadigede væv og nerve. Når hele området er blevet gennemrenset og poleret, vil tanden blive fyldt med en biokompatibel gummiforbindelse kaldet gutta percha. Tanden er derefter dækket med en tandfyldning eller tandkrone for at genoprette styrke og funktion.<br/><br/>Endodontisk terapi har et dårligt ry som en smertefuld procedure. Med roterende endodonti er en rodbehandling ikke mere smertefuld end at have en tandfyldning placeret. Infektionen og skader på nerven er det, der skaber den ekstreme smerte og ubehag, og patienter vil du opleve betydelig lindring efter at have gennemgået rodbehandling. Rodkanaler har en succesrate på 95% og giver folk mulighed for at bevare deres naturlige tænder. |
| Churchyard Bottom Wood<br/><br/>Highgate<br/><br/>Churchyard Bottom Wood, Highgate<br/><br/>Now called Queen's Wood<br/><br/>Between 1860 and 1880 the centre was torn out of the City of London to build sewers, railways and new roads. Houses were demolished without regard for the tenants who had to find whatever accommodation they could elsewhere. Managers went to livo in Kensington and St. John's Wood, while the poorest crowded into the rookeries like Seven Dials and Lisson Grove. For those between, the clerks and skilled workmen, speculative builders put up row after row of terraced villas and Mr Pooter moved into Holloway. The people of Muswell Hill watched houses creep across the fields of Finsbury Park, up Crouch Hill and down the other side, so that by 1880, Crouch End was being developed and there seemed no way to stem the flow. Ten years later the large estates of Muswell Hill were being sold. Upton Farm was sold and the Ecclesiastical Commissioners wanted to develop Churchyard Bottom Wood, now called Queen's Wood. The story would have made an Ibsen play. Two groups of honest, highly motivated people fighting for what they each thought was right. The Ecclesiastical Commissioners on the one hand and the Committee of the Hornsey Charities on the other, both believed they were doing their best for other people, and the public rose against them both in indignation<br/><br/>At that time Muswell Hill Road was a country road, with Southwood Hall at one end and Upton Farm at the other. By 1894, Onslow Gardens was built, Connaught Gardens marked out, and builders were poised to develop the Woodlands estate. Cut out of Churchyard Bottom Wood was a group of tumble-down cottages, on a triangular site. An undated map, held by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners shows six Wasteland Cottages with an opening between them - not a road, not metalled, but a way through to the strawberry beds behind. Further along was another gap which led to footpaths through the wood. These two openings were to be the basis of the plan. The same two gaps and the cleared ground, which was the strawberry field, can be seen in the 1894 map below. They are shown as 'Muswell Hill Cottages' and, quite in passing, Peter Sellers was to live on the same site much later on. To develop the wood as a housing estate, the Commissioners needed to drive two roads through from Muswell Hill Road and build houses along them. The Muswell Hill Road frontage alone would not have provided room for enough houses to make the venture worthwhile.<br/><br/>The land and cottages had been given much earlier as almshouses to house old people and were held on their behalf by the Trustees of the Hornsey Charity Commissioners. By the 1890s the cottages were tumble-down, in need of major repair. Public-spirited, wishing to do the best for their old tenants, the Trustees could not improve them since they had no money. Some years before the Ecclesiastical Commissioners had planned to develop Gravel Pit Wood (now Highgate Wood) as a housing estate, but this had met such opposition that they backed down. Instead, in 1886, they gave all 69 acres woodland to the public. At the same time they offered to sell Churchyard Bottom Wood to Hornsey Urban District Council for £25,000, but this was too much for Hornsey to raise on its own. The Council said that people living outside Hornsey also enjoyed the wood and other authorities should help, but no help was given. In the end the offer fell into abeyance.<br/><br/>Map showing the Muswell Hill Cottages which were the centre of the controversy.<br/><br/>Muswell Hill Road about 1880<br/><br/>It seems probable that these three pairs of cottages<br/>were the ones at the centre of the dispute.<br/><br/>The Ecclesiastical Commissioners wanted to raise money for its church work in Britain and abroad. They considered that they had been given the land to be used for the propogat­ion of religion and if this meant selling off land or woods, it was a lesser evil than restricting the work of the church. They had given Gravel Pit Wood to the public: in its place they would develop Churchyard Bottom Wood.<br/><br/>The Trustees of the Hornsey Charities wanted to produce an income to help their poor people, so they made an offer to the Commissioners. Their triangular piece of land was too awkwardly shaped to be developed economically, but if the Commissioners would grant them some more land to make it into a square site, they would build twenty-five neat villas. These would bring in ground rents of £225 per annum, which could be used to relieve the poverty of Hornsey people. In return they would permit the Commission­ers to cut two roads through their land so that the Commissioners could develop the woods.<br/><br/>When this offer became known people immediately reacted with alarm.<br/><br/>On the 16th December 1893 Mr Carvell Williams MP asked in the House of Commons, if the Ecclesiastical Commissioners had consented to sell a strip of land to the Hornsey Charities Trustees on condition that an existing road be widened to 40 feet, whether this was a preliminary to a building scheme and if the House of Parliament would have an opportunity to express an opinion.<br/><br/>Mr Leveson Gower, a Church Estates Commissioner replied',"Yes" to the first part.<br/><br/>Mr Carvell Williams, "Do I understand it is the intention to destroy that portion of Highgate Woods by building on it?"<br/><br/>Two days later The Star published an article worthy of any modern tabloid.<br/><br/>The Star<br/>18th December 1893<br/><br/>'Parliament must keep a keen watch on those old vandals and confederates of the jerry-builder the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. They are always alienating some piece of land or are favouring the builders as opposed to the general public. The Commissioners would not sell the Churchyard Bottom wood to the ratepayers but now propose 'to open it up' by cutting two wide roads through it in connection with one of their numerous building schemes. Will not someone ask a question in Parliament and check the brick and mortar policy of the Commissioners?'<br/><br/>By the time this was printed, the question had been asked and the answer was either untrue, or devious. Other papers took up the story. The Times, in a long report, said that the Comnussioners were not prepared to give an undertaking that Parliament, or any other public body, should have an opportunity of considering any scheme for building on the site of the wood.<br/><br/>The situation simmered for eighteen months until the Ecclesiastical Commissioners were forced to open an enquiry, which began at Highgate on 31 May 1895, chaired by an Assistant Ecclesiastical Commissioner. The Inquiry produced a flurry of newspaper letters of which this was the most important.<br/><br/>The Daily Chronicle, 5 June 1895<br/><br/>VANDALISM AT HIGHGATE<br/><br/>Sir –<br/><br/>One of the most lovely bits of woodland in suburan London is threatened. Will you help us to ward off what would be a calamity, not only to the immediate district, but to the whole of densely-populated North London? In no part of the metropolis has the builder been more active than in Crouch End and Hornsey. The beautiful meadows of a year or two ago are now houses and shops. Ballast heaps have taken the place of stately elms and chestnuts, and once pleasant villages are sharing the fate of Stroud Green, Harringay, Finsbury Park, Highbury and Islington. ---<br/><br/>---- The object is the construction of two forty-foot roads through the woods. We in this district know the meaning of forty-foot roads through woods. It means that the woods are doomed. Ten years ago agitation saved the sister-wood of sixty-five acres - The Gravel Pit Woods - and no one who saw the Bank Holiday crowds flocking up the Archway Road from the dreary streets of Holloway, Islington and Clerkenwell, and watched the keen enjoyment of the children and family parties picnicking on the grass and among the trees, could fail to realise the immense boon that the grant by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners of this wood has been to the whole of North London, but the Lower Wood of sixty acres has always been regarded as a natural complement of the other. ----<br/><br/>--- The Ecclesiastical Commissioners own nearly one-third of the large parish of Hornsey. By the liberal expenditure of the ratepayers' money in the opening up of roads and the general development of the district, the value of their property has been enormously increased, and from this unearned increment they each year draw large revenues. Surely the ratepayers whose money has thus aided in creating the immense estate may expect liberal treatment in return. ---<br/><br/>Yours obediently,<br/><br/>Signed by The Vicar of St James', Muswell Hill, the Minister of Park Chapel, Crouch End, a barrister living in Onslow Gardens and three members of the District Council.<br/><br/>It was a shot right across the bows of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. Their own religious leaders and the District Council, all up in arms saying in effect that the church was too rich and should be charitable, not greedy. The inclusion of the two clergymen was a shrewd move. Remember to that this was still in the height of the Darwin controversy. Darwin had split belief in the teachings of the Church and many people would have resented the power of the Church from that point of view alone. The Church was not so secure as it pretended to be.<br/><br/>The Evening News, 7 June 1895 said:-<br/><br/>"If the Ecclesiastical Comnussioners are not tackled at once, the building octopus will get a grip of the wood which will be very difficult to loosen later on, ---. Therefore it behoves Londoners to be up and doing if they would save one of their most delightful bits of rustic scenery. The public inquiry stands adjourned to Thursday next, and before then something must be done to convince the Commissioners that the citizens of London will not tolerate the confiscation of one of their favourite playgrounds."<br/><br/>A letter in the Daily Chronicle the next day said:-<br/><br/>.... It was with great relief that that the residents, some ten years ago, heard that the purchase of the Upper Wood had been effected; and how delightful a boon this has proved, anyone who visited them can testify, but all who exerted themselves to save these upper woods, which lie on the west side of Muswell Hill road, felt that their victory was incomplete so long as the sixty acres on the east side remained in danger. It is, as it were, an accident that the woods are divided by a broad high road. Can anyone doubt what the effect would be if the Churchyard Bottom Wood were replaced by rows of small villas, each sending out its contribution of smoke and soot? Can anyone doubt, too, the serious difference it would make to the picturesque setting of the purchased woods if a line of staring new houses were to be run up right over against their leafy frontage?'<br/><br/>This expressed the opinions of many people. In fact, the Gravel Pit Wood, which the writer calls the 'Upper Wood', had not been purchased, but given to the district by the Ecclesiastical Commission, a point they were to reiterate time and again over the years, but most people ignored it. The Commission was not going to give away a second wood whatever anyone said, and held this position to the end.<br/><br/>H.S.Chamberlain, of 5 Cranley Gardens,<br/>in a letter to the Times dated June 8, 1895, urged purchase.<br/><br/>I know that it is common to speak harshly of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, but as the trustees of a fund they are bound to administer it to the greatest advantage, and therefore, if anything is to be done to save the demolition of the wood, it appears to me that it can only be effected by the purchase of the property from the Comnussioners, who I know, are fully alive to the protection of free and open spaces for the people, and who, I feel sure, would be disposed to treat the matter of a purchase in a free and liberal spirit, as they have already done in the matter of the Shepherd's Cot-field, by granting a lease to the Crouch End Playing-fields Company - a small company in which I own a few shares, a small company which was formed exclusively for the purpose of securing the fields for cricket, tennis etc.<br/><br/>(This refers the the Crouch End Playing Fields which had been secured a few years later.)<br/><br/>As Chairman of the Muswell Hill Conservative Association, I am constantly in touch with the inhabitants, and I can safely affirm that every person resident in the neighbourhood would do anything in reason to preserve.<br/><br/>(All he wanted personally was Charity income to support his poor people. He demanded his acre of land - not a great deal surely - he believed the Commissioners' assurance that the wood was not in danger.)<br/><br/>' Muswell Hill Road was one of the best in Hornsey and would remain equally beautiful, houses or no houses',<br/><br/>(and then came the great rhetorical flourish.)<br/><br/>'Are the poor to suffer because of the sentimental objections and the hysterical cry of 'wolf just raised by your correspondents? Something must be done and that soon. An acre of back-land added to the charity-estate would make no apprec­iable difference to the land remaining, while the profit derived from it would succour many poor old and deserving persons in their declining years and enable us to hand over to our successors an estate which in the distant future would be of great value in the rendering of charitable aid to the deserving poor of the parish of Hornsey.'<br/><br/>Reading his letter one senses hysteria very near the surface. Why did he think the Commissioners wanted to build a road? Why should they spend all that money if not to build houses? He never seemed to realise that for an acre of land the the whole wood would be lost. But he had been with the problem for a long time. He was the person to whom the Commissioners had made the offer of sale for £25,000 years before and it is his name which is honoured in a plaque on Crouch End Clock Tower for saving the wood, but his trust in the Ecclesiastical Commissioners seems naive. It is sad that at the Inquiry he was to be cast as the devil.<br/><br/>The Inquiry Continued<br/><br/>The adjourned opened in Highgate on 15 June 1895. Expecting a large gather­ing, the Council Chamber had been changed completely. The usual tables had been removed and the room filled with chairs. By half past seven the room was crowded, with people jostling for seats.<br/><br/>Mr Murray, the Commissioner, said the Inquiry was really a simple one. Hornsey Parochial Charities wished to purchase a piece of land adjoining their charity property at the back. The question was whether the Charity Commission, which controlled all charities, had enough power to stop them. The Church Commissioners were prepared to sell the land at very favourable terms and the income of the Charity would be very considerable increased.<br/><br/>Against this there were three classes of objection.<br/><br/>The original Trust was for the purpose of providing cottages for the Poor, but the trustees were proposing to build villas which would be too expensive for the Poor. However, it was within the power of the Trustees to vary the terms of the Trust, so they could build villas if they thought that the Poor would benefit in the end. The poor people themselves might object, but liberal provisions had already been promised for them. The third objection related to the aesthetic and public side of the question. He took it from what he had read that the Charity Commission ought to interfere to prevent the Ecclesiastical Commissioners from exercising their own discretion in dealing with their own property.<br/><br/>The Inquiry discussed fine points, but the speakers kept coming back to the major problem of preventing any destruction of the wood. The Vestry Clerk of Islington, representing 300,000 people, made a formal protest about any part of the wood, so valuable for the people of Islington and Hornsey being used for private purposes. Mr Wilfred White said that if the Commissioners would give them time they would be able to raise the money to compensate the Trustees.<br/><br/>Mr Beaumont said they did not want villas, they wanted cottages for poor people who were being driven out of the district. Others said that there was no money to build cottages to replace the present delapidated ones but villas would be an economic proposition. Others retorted that there were score of villas to let in Highgate. The Wood was sacred. Stick to the question of the Wood.<br/><br/>Dr Fletcher said the cry among the working people was that there was nowhere to go. Working people came to him with the cry, "We are driven out of Highgate and are obliged to go to Highgate New Town." If the Muswell Hill Road frontage was sold there was no question but that roads might be cut right through the woods in the direction of Hornsey, but if the Commissioners could not get the land from the Charity Commission they could not cut the road.<br/><br/>He was very sure the cottages could be put into a fit state of repair. He was asked by the poor people, by the police and by a number of the working classes to represent these two points, that cottage accommodation was very sorely needed in Highgate and that if they once allowed the land to be sold, there was no telling where the hand of the builder would be stayed.<br/><br/>(Loud and prolonged cheers).<br/><br/>Numerous other people spoke and the Comnussioner summed up by saying that he took it that the prevailing opinion was in favour of retaining the cottages but the meeting should draw no conclusions from what he had said (Groans).<br/><br/>Others said that the Trustees of the Charity had failed in their duties by letting the the cottages fall into disrepair.<br/><br/>Mr H.R.Williams, the Trustee who had written to the paper earlier, said that he had it on the best authority that the Church Commissioners would make no roads whatever and they would not be benefitted one iota by the actions of the Charity Commissioners. Others were far less trusting and the meeting closed after nearly three hours.<br/><br/>'We are faced with the fact that in Highgate and Muswell Hill there are a number of persons who want the Churchyard Bottom Wood and will not be happy until they have got it - while nobody appears willing to spend a farthing to pay for it. Everyone says it would be a fine thing to have the wood as open space, but everybody thinks it is the duty of someone else to make it one. The Islington Vestry has 'resolved' on the subject, but the Islington Vestry does not offer a penny piece towards the purchase. --- There is no more difficult problem for the community or the individual to solve than how to gain possession of other people's property without paying for it.'<br/><br/>Paying for it was indeed the problem as Churchyard Bottom Wood became the subject of intense local and national debate. A joint committee was formed to raise money to save the wood. On 20 November 1896, C.F.Cory-Wright, Hon Treasurer, wrote to The Standard, a daily paper at that time, appealing for help. He reminded everyone of the danger of losing the wood and said it could only be saved by buying it. The Church Commissioners would sell for £25,000 and an extra (5,000 would be required for fencing and drainage, making a total of £30,000. This was too much for Hornsey Council to raise but they had already voted £10,000 towards the total. The woods were of inestimable value to all of North London so he appealed to public bodies and private people to raise the remaining £20,000. He warned that the present offer from the Church Commissioners was open only to the end of 1898. After that the builders would move in.<br/><br/>The appeal was warmly welcomed by the press. A Private Bill was rushed through Parliament and the Highgate Woods Preservation Act, 1897, became law. The Conunittee now had the right to advertise for contributions towards buying the Wood and preserving it.<br/><br/>In a fairly short time almost all the money was raised, but the last few thousand proved very difficult to raise and the Commissioners' deadline was a matter of weeks away. Mr Cory-Wright wrote pleading for more time but was granted a mere three months and then only if interest at 4 per cent was paid for the extra period on the full sum. In the end the London County Council, which had originally offered £2,500, made this up to £5,000 and the total was reached, but it was a close-run thing.<br/><br/>The Council decided to re-name the Wood as 'Queen's Woods' in honour of Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee and Hornsey put on a fine display of bunting when the Duchess of Albany formally declared the Wood open 'for the free use of the public for ever'.<br/><br/>While the campaign to save Churchyard Bottom Wood was run and directed by local people who felt passionately about this particular piece of woodland, they called on the help and experience of a vast network of people, some of whom had worked together on similar campaigns for over thirty years. The Committee issued an appeal, printed on very good quality paper and bearing some famous names.<br/><br/>The questions of open space and public health were major subjects of the Victorian vision.<br/><br/>The Open Spaces Movement<br/><br/>Octavia Hill, the great housing reformer, who had begun with three old houses in Marylebone, bought for her by Jolm Ruskin, had quickly become an expert on housing poor people in the healthiest conditions possible. Her way was to buy leases and then knock down some of the crowded houses in order to bring light and air to the rest, believing that fresh air and sunlight were the the only way poor people could be saved from 'putrid fever. She had learnt this as a child from her grandfather, Southwood Smith, who developed his theories at the Fever Hospital at King's Cross.<br/><br/>He had built the first Industrial Dwellings for poor people and had proved statistically that good air and decent drainage saved lives. Gibson Gardens, in Northwold Road, is a direct outcome of Southwood Smith's ideas. More Information on Gibson Gardens<br/><br/>The Importance of Open Air<br/><br/>Open spaces and the opportunity to breathe clean air, were essential for people living in one or two crowded rooms. Octavia Hill took her charges from the Lisson Grove slums, up Fitzjohn's Avenue to Hampstead Heath. She so loved the Fitzjohn's Avenue fields that she tried to buy them as a public park. They were to cost £10,000 and within three August weeks £8,500 had been raised. It needed only the end of the summer holidays and the return from holiday of sympathetic friends and the further £1,500 would have been raised, but the owners suddenly withdrew their offer. Despite all pleading, the fields were covered with large houses.<br/><br/>From this developed the campaign to save Parliament Hill, the next open space northwards from Lisson Grove, buying up fields in the path of the builders to make a permanent cordon sanitalre against the advancing bricks. The Parliament Hill Fields campaign was so successful that the Hampstead Heath Bill was passed and there was money over from the appeal. From this money and the impetus towards open spaces, was to develop the National Trust. Octavia Hill had been interested in protecting areas like Church Bottom Wood for years, so she was a natural ally in the fight to save the Wood.<br/><br/>The Commons Preservation Society also, was familiar with this kind of agitation and money collection. They had torn down fencing when lords of the manor had enclosed pieces of common land, leading both legal and illegal battles against the arrogant privatization of land traditionally free. Robert Hunter, their Honorary Solicitor from 1868, was always concerned with securing open spaces, large or small, for the public. He, now Sir Robert Hunter, became the Chairman of the Church Bottom Appeal. The Chairman of the Commons Preservation Society was Mr Shaw-Lefevre MP (later Lord Eversley) who played a big part in this and other campaigns in the House of Commons. Octavia Hill had been involved in their work from about 1875.<br/><br/>At the same time Octavia Hill was campaigning for a Burials Bill.<br/><br/>City churchyards had become so full and such a serious a hazard to health, by contaminating wells from which people drew their drinking water, that City burials were no longer permitted. Instead, cemetries were created on the outskirts of town. Abney Park Cemetary was one of these. There was then a movement to remove the headstones to the edges of the old town cemetries, re-inter the bodies elsewhere and turn the cemetries into gardens and open spaces, instead of building on them. This land in the centre of London was very valuable and speculators were avid to obtain it: Even the Quakers had built over one of their cemetries and threatened to do so again by building over Bunhill Fields. Octavia Hill had a network of allies in a dozen fields, so her help to save the Church Bottom Wood must have been invaluable.<br/><br/>The Metropolitan Gardens Society, set up in 1882, had laid out about two hundred small gardens in city centres by 1890. They later handed them over to the Local Authorities, so their support for the Churchyard Bottom Wood Appeal was assured from the start.<br/><br/>The Kyrle Society is forgotten now, but in its day had great influence on Town Planning and Open Space legislation. The Society had been set up about 1875 for 'the Diffusion of Beauty', to bring colour and interest into the lives of people living in dull, drab surroundings. Bright colour to walls and decoration, good singing, open spaces, Nature, Literature and Art. All these fell within the Society's remit. There was a Decorative Branch, for whom William Morris lectured; a Musical Branch to promote choirs and Happy Evenings for people in local school buildings; and a Literature Branch. The Society appealed regularly by letters in The Times, to 'the richer classes' for books and periodicals to be distributed to boys' and girls' clubs, almshouses and elsewhere. However the Open Spaces Committee was the most active. The very name 'Kyrle' came from Pope's The Man of Ross, the philanthropist who gave his birthplace to the people as a public park. | Kirkegård Bund Træ<br/><br/>Highgate<br/><br/>Churchyard Bottom Wood anmeldelser, Highgate<br/><br/>Nu kaldet Dronningens Træ<br/><br/>Mellem 1860 og 1880 blev centret revet ud af City of London for at bygge kloakker, jernbaner og nye veje. Huse blev revet ned uden hensyn til lejerne, der måtte finde den indkvartering, de kunne andre steder. Ledere gik til livo i Kensington og St. John's Wood, mens de fattigste overfyldte i rookeries som Seven Dials og Lisson Grove. For dem mellem, kontorister og dygtige arbejdere, spekulative bygherrer sat op række efter række af rækkehuse villaer og hr Pooter flyttede ind Holloway. Befolkningen i Muswell Hill så huse krybe hen over markerne i Finsbury Park, op Crouch Hill og ned på den anden side, så i 1880 var Crouch End ved at blive udviklet, og der syntes ingen måde at dæmme op for strømmen. Ti år senere blev de store godser på Muswell Hill solgt. Upton Farm blev solgt, og de kirkelige kommissærer ønskede at udvikle Churchyard Bottom Wood, nu kaldet Queen's Wood. Historien ville have lavet et Ibsen-spil. To grupper af ærlige, højt motiverede mennesker kæmper for, hvad de hver især troede var rigtigt. De kirkelige kommissærer på den ene side og komitéen af Hornsey velgørenhedsorganisationer på den anden, begge troede, at de gjorde deres bedste for andre mennesker, og offentligheden rejste sig mod dem begge i harme.<br/><br/>På det tidspunkt var Muswell Hill Road en landevej, med Southwood Hall i den ene ende og Upton Farm på den anden. I 1894 blev Onslow Gardens bygget, Connaught Gardens markeret, og bygherrer var klar til at udvikle Woodlands ejendom. Cut ud af Churchyard Bottom Wood var en gruppe af tumble-down hytter, på en trekantet websted. Et udateret kort, som holdes af de kirkelige kommissærer, viser seks Wasteland Cottages med en åbning mellem dem - ikke en vej, ikke metalliseret, men en vej gennem til jordbærsengene bagved. Længere fremme var et andet hul, som førte til stier gennem træet. Disse to åbninger skulle være grundlaget for planen. De samme to huller og den ryddede jord, som var jordbærfeltet, kan ses på kortet fra 1894 nedenfor. De er vist som 'Muswell Hill Cottages', og ganske i forbifarten skulle Peter Sellers bo på samme sted meget senere. For at udvikle træet som en boligejendom, kommissærerne havde brug for at køre to veje gennem fra Muswell Hill Road og bygge huse langs dem. Den Muswell Hill Road facade alene ville ikke have givet plads til nok huse til at gøre venture værd.<br/><br/>De jord og hytter var blevet givet meget tidligere som almisse huse til at huse gamle mennesker og blev afholdt på deres vegne af Trustees af Hornsey velgørenhed kommissærer. Ved 1890'erne hytterne var tumble-down, behov for større reparation. Offentlig-åndet, der ønsker at gøre det bedste for deres gamle lejere, kunne Trustees ikke forbedre dem, da de ikke havde penge. Nogle år før de kirkelige kommissærer havde planlagt at udvikle Gravel Pit Wood (nu Highgate Wood) som en bolig ejendom, men dette havde mødt en sådan modstand, at de bakkede ned. I stedet, i 1886, de gav alle 69 acres skov til offentligheden. Samtidig tilbød de at sælge Churchyard Bottom Wood til Hornsey Urban District Council for 25.000 pund, men dette var for meget for Hornsey at rejse på egen hånd. Rådet sagde, at folk, der bor uden for Hornsey, også nød træet, og andre myndigheder skulle hjælpe, men der blev ikke givet nogen hjælp.<br/><br/>Kort, der viser Muswell Hill Cottages, som var centrum for kontroversen.<br/><br/>Muswell Hill Road omkring 1880<br/><br/>Det synes sandsynligt, at disse tre par hytter var dem i centrum af tvisten.<br/><br/>Ecclesiastical Commissioners ønskede at rejse penge til sit kirkelige arbejde i Storbritannien og i udlandet. De mente, at de havde fået jorden, der skulle bruges til religionens propogation, og hvis dette betød at sælge jord eller skov, var det et mindre onde end at begrænse kirkens arbejde. De havde givet Gravel Pit Wood til offentligheden: i stedet ville de udvikle Churchyard Bottom Wood.<br/><br/>De Trustees af Hornsey Velgørenhedsorganisationer ønskede at producere en indkomst til at hjælpe deres fattige folk, så de gjorde et tilbud til kommissærerne. Deres trekantede stykke jord var for akavet formet til at blive udviklet økonomisk, men hvis kommissærerne ville give dem noget mere jord for at gøre det til et firkantet sted, ville de bygge femogtyve pæne villaer. Disse ville indbringe jordrenter på 225 EUR om året, som kunne anvendes til at afhjælpe Hornsey-folkets fattigdom, og til gengæld ville de give Kommissionen mulighed for at skære to veje gennem deres jord, så kommissærerne kunne udvikle skoven.<br/><br/>Da dette tilbud blev kendt, reagerede folk straks med alarm.<br/><br/>Den 16. december 1893 spurgte hr. Carvell Williams MP i Underhuset, om de kirkelige kommissærer havde indvilget i at sælge en stribe jord til Hornsey Charities Trustees på betingelse af, at en eksisterende vej udvides til 40 fod, om dette var en foreløbig til en byggeplan, og om Parlamentet ville have mulighed for at udtrykke en mening.<br/><br/>Mr. Leveson Gower, en kirke Estates kommissær svarede "Ja" til den første del.<br/><br/>Mr. Carvell Williams, "Forstår jeg, at det er hensigten at ødelægge den del af Highgate Woods ved at bygge på den?"<br/><br/>To dage senere udgav The Star en artikel, der var enhver moderne tabloid værdig.<br/><br/>Stjernen<br/>18. december 1893<br/><br/>Parlamentet skal holde skarpt øje med de gamle vandaler og forbund, der tilhører de kirkelige kommissærer, og som altid støder et stykke jord fra sig eller favoriserer bygherrerne i modsætning til den brede offentlighed. Kommissærerne ville ikke sælge Churchyard Bottom-træet til skatteyderne, men foreslår nu at "åbne det op" ved at skære to brede veje gennem det i forbindelse med en af deres mange byggeordninger. Er der ikke nogen, der vil stille et spørgsmål i Parlamentet og kontrollere kommissærernes murstens- og mørtelpolitik?'<br/><br/>Da dette blev trykt, var spørgsmålet blevet stillet, og svaret var enten usandt eller lusket. Andre papirer tog historien op. The Times sagde i en lang rapport, at kommunerne ikke var villige til at give et løfte om, at Parlamentet eller noget andet offentligt organ skulle have mulighed for at overveje enhver ordning for bygning på stedet af træet.<br/><br/>Situationen simmered i atten måneder, indtil de kirkelige kommissærer blev tvunget til at åbne en undersøgelse, som begyndte i Highgate den 31. maj 1895, ledet af en assisterende kirkelige kommissær. Undersøgelsen producerede en byge af avisbreve, hvoraf dette var det vigtigste.<br/><br/>Den daglige krønike, 5. juni 1895<br/><br/>VANDALISME PÅ HIGGATE<br/><br/>Sir -<br/><br/>Vil du hjælpe os med at afværge det, der ville være en katastrofe, ikke kun for den umiddelbare bydel, men for hele det tætbefolkede Nordlondon? I ingen del af metropolen har bygherren været mere aktiv end i Crouch End og Hornsey. De smukke enge af et år eller to siden er nu huse og butikker. Ballast dynger har taget pladsen for statelige elm og kastanjer, og når behagelige landsbyer deler skæbne Stroud Green, Harringay, Finsbury Park, Highbury og Islington.<br/><br/>---- Formålet er opførelsen af to fyrre fods veje gennem skoven. Vi i dette distrikt kender betydningen af fyrre fods veje gennem skoven. Det betyder, at skoven er dødsdømt. For ti år siden reddede agitation søstertræet på femogtres acres - The Gravel Pit Woods - og ingen, der så Bank Holiday folkemængderne flokkes op på Archway Road fra de triste gader i Holloway, Islington og Clerkenwell, og så den ivrige nydelse af børnene og familiens acres picnic på græsset og blandt træerne, kunne undlade at indse den enorme velsignelse, at de kirkelige kommissærers bevilget hele dette træ. ----<br/><br/>De kirkelige kommissærer ejer næsten en tredjedel af det store sogn Hornsey. Ved de liberale udgifter af rentebetalernes penge til åbning af veje og den generelle udvikling af distriktet er værdien af deres ejendom blevet enormt forøget, og fra denne ufortjente stigning trækker de hvert år store indtægter. Bestemt de rentebetalere, hvis penge har således hjulpet med at skabe den enorme ejendom kan forvente liberal behandling til gengæld.<br/><br/>Deres lydighed,<br/><br/>Underskrevet af Vicar of St James ', Muswell Hill, ministeren for Park Chapel, Crouch End, en advokat, der bor i Onslow Gardens og tre medlemmer af District Council.<br/><br/>Det var et skud lige på tværs af buerne af de kirkelige kommissærer. Deres egne religiøse ledere og District Council, alle i våben siger i realiteten, at kirken var for rig og bør være velgørende, ikke grådige. Det var et klogt træk at medtage de to gejstlige. Darwin havde splittet troen på Kirkens lære, og mange mennesker ville have foragtet Kirkens magt fra det synspunkt alene. Kirken var ikke så sikker, som den foregav at være.<br/><br/>The Evening News, den 7. juni 1895 sagde:<br/><br/>"Hvis de kirkelige komnussioners ikke tackles med det samme, vil bygningsblæksprutten få et greb om træet, som vil være meget vanskeligt at løsne senere, ----. Derfor påhviler det londonerne at være oppe og gøre, hvis de ville redde en af deres mest dejlige bits af rustik natur. Den offentlige undersøgelse udsættes til næste torsdag, og inden da skal der gøres noget for at overbevise kommissærerne om, at borgerne i London ikke vil tolerere konfiskation af en af deres yndlingslegepladser.<br/><br/>I et brev i Daily Chronicle dagen efter stod der:<br/><br/>.... Det var med stor lettelse, at beboerne for omkring ti år siden hørte, at købet af Øvre Skov var blevet gennemført; og hvor dejligt en velsignelse dette har bevist, kan enhver, der besøgte dem, vidne, men alle, der anstrengede sig for at redde disse øvre skove, som ligger på vestsiden af Muswell Hill Road, følte, at deres sejr var ufuldstændig, så længe de 60 hektar på østsiden forblev i fare. Det er så at sige en ulykke, at skovene deles af en bred landevej. Kan nogen tvivle på, hvad virkningen ville være, hvis kirkegården Bottom Wood blev erstattet af rækker af små villaer, hver sender sit bidrag af røg og sod? Kan nogen også betvivle den alvorlige forskel, det ville gøre for den maleriske indstilling af de indkøbte skove, hvis en linje af stirrende nye huse skulle køres op lige overfor deres grønne facade? "<br/><br/>Dette gav udtryk for mange menneskers meninger. Faktisk var Gravel Pit Wood, som forfatteren kalder "Øvre Wood", ikke blevet købt, men givet til distriktet af den kirkelige kommission, et punkt, de skulle gentage igen og igen i årenes løb, men de fleste ignorerede det. Kommissionen havde ikke tænkt sig at give afkald på endnu et træ, uanset hvad nogen sagde, og holdt denne holdning til det sidste.<br/><br/>H.S.Chamberlain fra 5 Cranley Gardens opfordrede i et brev til Times dateret 8. juni 1895 til køb.<br/><br/>Jeg ved, at det er almindeligt at tale hårdt om de kirkelige kommissærer, men som forvaltere af en fond er de forpligtet til at administrere det til den største fordel, og derfor, hvis der skal gøres noget for at redde nedrivning af træet, forekommer det mig, at det udelukkende kan ske ved køb af ejendommen fra Comnussioners, som jeg ved, er fuldt ud i live til beskyttelse af frie og åbne pladser for de mennesker, der ville have gjort.<br/><br/>(Dette refererer til Crouch End Playing Fields, som var blevet sikret et par år senere.)<br/><br/>Som formand for Muswell Hill Conservative Association er jeg konstant i kontakt med indbyggerne, og jeg kan med sikkerhed bekræfte, at hver person, der bor i nabolaget, ville gøre noget for at bevare.<br/><br/>(Det eneste, han personligt ønskede, var velgørenhedsindtægter for at forsørge sit fattige folk, og han forlangte - ikke så meget sikkert - at han troede på kommissærernes forsikring om, at skoven ikke var i fare.)<br/><br/>Muswell Hill Road var en af de bedste i Hornsey og ville forblive lige så smukke, huse eller ingen huse.<br/><br/>(Og så kom den store retoriske blomst.)<br/><br/>Skal de fattige lide på grund af de sentimentale indvendinger og ulvens hysteriske skrig, som jeres korrespondenter lige har rejst? En acre af back-land tilføjet til velgørenhed-ejendom ville gøre nogen mærkbar forskel for den jord, der er tilbage, mens den profit, der stammer fra det ville hjælpe mange fattige gamle og fortjener personer i deres faldende år og gøre det muligt for os at overgive til vores efterfølgere en ejendom, som i en fjern fremtid ville være af stor værdi i ydelsen af velgørende bistand til de fortjener fattige i sognet Hornsey.<br/><br/>Når man læser hans brev, fornemmer man hysteri meget tæt på overfladen. Hvorfor troede han, at kommissærerne ønskede at bygge en vej? Hvorfor skulle de bruge alle de penge, hvis ikke for at bygge huse? Han syntes aldrig at indse, at for en acre jord hele skoven ville være tabt. Men han havde været med problemet i lang tid. Han var den person, som kommissærerne havde gjort tilbuddet om salg for 25.000 år før, og det er hans navn, der er hædret i en mindeplade på Crouch End Clock Tower for at redde træet, men hans tillid til de kirkelige kommissærer synes naiv. Det er sørgeligt, at han ved Undersøgelsen skulde kastes som Djævelen.<br/><br/>Undersøgelsen fortsatte<br/><br/>Den hævede åbning i Highgate den 15. juni 1895. I forventning om en stor samling var rådskammeret blevet ændret fuldstændigt. De sædvanlige borde var blevet fjernet, og rummet fyldt med stole. Klokken halv syv var værelset overfyldt, med folk, der skubbede efter pladser.<br/><br/>Hr. Murray, kommissæren, sagde, at undersøgelsen var virkelig en simpel en. Hornsey Parochial Charities ønskede at købe et stykke jord tilstødende deres velgørenhed ejendom på bagsiden. Spørgsmålet var, om velgørenhedskommissionen, som kontrollerede alle velgørenhedsorganisationer, havde nok magt til at stoppe dem. Kirkekommissærerne var indstillet på at sælge jorden til meget gunstige vilkår, og velgørenhedssamfundets indkomst ville blive meget betydelig forøget.<br/><br/>Mod dette var der tre klasser af indvendinger.<br/><br/>Den oprindelige Trust var med henblik på at give hytter til de fattige, men trustees foreslog at bygge villaer, som ville være for dyrt for de fattige. Men det var inden for magt Trustees at variere vilkårene i Trust, så de kunne bygge villaer, hvis de troede, at de fattige ville gavne i sidste ende. De stakkels Folk kunde selv gøre Indvendinger, men der var allerede lovet dem liberale Bestemmelser. den tredje Indvending vedrørte den æstetiske og offentlige Side af Spørgsmaalet. Han tog det fra, hvad han havde læst, at velgørenhedskommissionen burde blande sig for at forhindre de kirkelige kommissærer i at udøve deres eget skøn i forbindelse med deres egen ejendom.<br/><br/>Undersøgelsen drøftede fine punkter, men talerne blev ved med at vende tilbage til det store problem med at forhindre enhver ødelæggelse af træet. Vestry Clerk of Islington, der repræsenterer 300.000 mennesker, lavede en formel protest om nogen del af træet, så værdifuldt for befolkningen i Islington og Hornsey, der blev brugt til private formål. Hr. Wilfred White sagde, at hvis kommissærerne ville give dem tid, ville de være i stand til at rejse penge til at kompensere Trustees.<br/><br/>Beaumont sagde, at de ikke ønskede villaer, de ønskede hytter til fattige mennesker, der blev drevet ud af distriktet. Andre sagde, at der ikke var penge til at bygge hytter til at erstatte de nuværende faldefærdige, men villaer ville være et økonomisk forslag. Andre svarede, at der var score af villaer til at lukke ind Highgate. Træet var helligt. Hold dig til spørgsmålet om skoven.<br/><br/>Dr. Fletcher sagde, at råbet blandt de arbejdende mennesker var, at der ikke var nogen steder at gå hen. Arbejdende mennesker kom til ham med råbet: "Vi er drevet ud af Highgate og er forpligtet til at gå til Highgate New Town." Hvis Muswell Hill Road-fronten blev solgt, var der ingen tvivl om, at vejene kunne skæres lige gennem skoven i retning af Hornsey, men hvis kommissærerne ikke kunne få jorden fra velgørenhedskommissionen, kunne de ikke skære vejen.<br/><br/>Han var meget sikker på, at hytterne kunne sættes i en passende tilstand af reparation. Han blev spurgt af de fattige, af politiet og af en række af de arbejdende klasser til at repræsentere disse to punkter, at sommerhus indkvartering var meget hårdt tiltrængt i Highgate, og at hvis de engang tillod jorden til at blive solgt, var der ingen at fortælle, hvor hånden af bygherren ville blive opholdt.<br/><br/>(Kraftigt og langvarigt jubel).<br/><br/>Talrige andre mennesker talte, og kommissæren opsummerede ved at sige, at han tog det, at den fremherskende mening var til fordel for at bevare hytterne, men mødet skulle ikke drage nogen konklusioner af, hvad han havde sagt (Groans).<br/><br/>Andre sagde, at Velgørenhedens Formyndere havde svigtet i deres Pligter ved at lade Hytterne falde i Forfald.<br/><br/>Hr. H.R. Williams, den tillidsmand, der havde skrevet til avisen tidligere, sagde, at han havde det på den bedste autoritet, at kirkekommissærerne ikke ville gøre nogen veje overhovedet, og de ville ikke få gavn en tøddel af velgørenhedskommissærernes handlinger. Andre var langt mindre tillidsfulde og mødet lukkede efter næsten tre timer.<br/><br/>"Vi står over for det faktum, at der i Highgate og Muswell Hill er en række personer, der ønsker Churchyard Bottom Wood og ikke vil være glade, før de har fået det - mens ingen synes villige til at bruge en farthing til at betale for det. Alle siger, at det ville være en fin ting at have træet som åbent rum, men alle mener, at det er en andens pligt at gøre det til en. Islington Vestry har 'løst' emnet, men Islington Vestry tilbyder ikke et penny stykke mod købet. Der er ikke noget vanskeligere problem for samfundet eller den enkelte at løse, end hvordan man får besiddelse af andres ejendom uden at betale for det.<br/><br/>At betale for det var faktisk problemet, da Churchyard Bottom Wood blev genstand for intens lokal og national debat. Et fælles udvalg blev dannet for at indsamle penge til at redde skoven. Den 20. november 1896 blev C.F. Cory-Wright, Hon Treasurer, skrev til The Standard, et dagblad på det tidspunkt, og bad om hjælp. Han mindede alle om faren for at miste træet og sagde, at det kun kunne reddes ved at købe det. Kirkens kommissærer ville sælge for 25.000 pund og en ekstra (5.000 ville være nødvendige for hegn og dræning, hvilket gør i alt 30.000 pund. Dette var for meget for Hornsey Council at hæve, men de havde allerede stemt 10.000 pund mod det samlede beløb. Skovene var af uvurderlig værdi for hele det nordlige London, så han appellerede til offentlige organer og privatpersoner om at hæve de resterende 20.000 pund. Han advarede om, at det nuværende tilbud fra kirkekommissærerne kun var åbent til slutningen af 1898. Herefter flytter bygherren ind.<br/><br/>Appellen blev varmt hilst velkommen af pressen. En privat lovforslag blev hastet gennem Parlamentet og Highgate Woods Preservation Act, 1897, blev lov. Conunittee havde nu ret til at reklamere for bidrag til at købe Wood og bevare det.<br/><br/>I løbet af ganske kort tid blev næsten alle pengene rejst, men de sidste par tusinde viste sig at være meget vanskelige at rejse, og kommissærernes frist var et spørgsmål om uger. Cory-Wright skrev indlæg for mere tid, men fik kun tre måneder og derefter kun, hvis renter på 4 procent blev betalt for den ekstra periode på det fulde beløb. I sidste ende gjorde London County Council, som oprindeligt havde tilbudt 2.500 pund, dette op til 5.000 pund, og det samlede beløb blev nået, men det var en tæt ting.<br/><br/>Rådet besluttede at omdøbe Wood som "Queen's Woods" til ære for dronning Victoria's Diamond Jubilee og Hornsey satte på en fin visning af bunting, da hertuginden af Albany formelt erklærede Wood åben "for fri brug af offentligheden for evigt".<br/><br/>Mens kampagnen for at redde Churchyard Bottom Wood blev kørt og instrueret af lokale mennesker, der følte lidenskabeligt om dette særlige stykke skov, opfordrede de til hjælp og erfaring fra et stort netværk af mennesker, hvoraf nogle havde arbejdet sammen om lignende kampagner i over tredive år. Udvalget udsendte en appel, trykt på papir af meget god kvalitet og med nogle berømte navne.<br/><br/>Spørgsmålene om åbent rum og folkesundhed var hovedemner i den victorianske vision.<br/><br/>Open Spaces bevægelsen<br/><br/>Octavia Hill, den store bolig reformator, der var begyndt med tre gamle huse i Marylebone, købt til hende af Jolm Ruskin, var hurtigt blevet en ekspert på boliger fattige mennesker i de sundeste betingelser muligt. Hendes måde var at købe lejemål og derefter banke ned nogle af de overfyldte huse for at bringe lys og luft til resten, at tro, at frisk luft og sollys var den eneste måde fattige mennesker kunne reddes fra 'putrid feber. Hun havde lært dette som barn fra sin bedstefar, Southwood Smith, der udviklede sine teorier på Fever Hospital på King's Cross.<br/><br/>Han havde bygget de første industrielle boliger til fattige mennesker og havde statistisk bevist, at god luft og anstændig dræning reddede liv. Gibson Gardens, i Northwold Road, er et direkte resultat af Southwood Smiths ideer. Flere oplysninger om Gibson Gardens<br/><br/>Betydningen af Open Air<br/><br/>Åbne rum og muligheden for at indånde ren luft, var afgørende for folk, der bor i et eller to overfyldte værelser. Octavia Hill tog hendes afgifter fra Lisson Grove slum, op Fitzjohns Avenue til Hampstead Heath. Hun var så vild med Fitzjohn's Avenue-markerne, at hun forsøgte at købe dem som en offentlig park. De skulle koste 10.000 pund og inden for tre august uger var 8.500 pund blevet rejst. Det havde kun brug for slutningen af sommerferien og tilbagevenden fra ferie af sympatiske venner og de yderligere 1.500 ville have været rejst, men ejerne pludselig trak deres tilbud tilbage. Trods alle bønfaldende, var markerne dækket med store huse.<br/><br/>Herfra udvikledes kampagnen for at redde Parliament Hill, det næste åbne rum nordpå fra Lisson Grove, hvor man opkøbte marker i bygmestrenes vej for at lave en permanent afspærringssanitalere mod de fremrykkende mursten. Parlamentet Hill Fields kampagnen var så vellykket, at Hampstead Heath Bill blev vedtaget, og der var penge over fra appellen. Fra disse penge og impulsen mod åbne rum, var at udvikle National Trust. Octavia Hill havde været interesseret i at beskytte områder som Church Bottom Wood i årevis, så hun var en naturlig allieret i kampen for at redde Wood.<br/><br/>Commons Preservation Society var også bekendt med denne form for agitation og pengeindsamling. De havde revet hegn ned, da herremænd havde lukket stykker af fælles jord, der fører både lovlige og ulovlige kampe mod den arrogante privatisering af jord traditionelt gratis. Robert Hunter, deres æresadvokat fra 1868, var altid optaget af at sikre åbne rum, store som små, for offentligheden. Han, nu Sir Robert Hunter, blev formand for Church Bottom Appeal. Formanden for Commons Preservation Society var Shaw-Lefevre MP (senere Lord Eversley), der spillede en stor rolle i dette og andre kampagner i Underhuset. Octavia Hill havde været involveret i deres arbejde fra omkring 1875.<br/><br/>På samme tid Octavia Hill var kampagne for en Begravelser Bill.<br/><br/>Byens kirkegårde var blevet så fulde og så alvorlige en sundhedsfare ved at forurene brønde, hvorfra folk hentede deres drikkevand, at byens begravelser ikke længere var tilladt. I stedet blev der oprettet kirkegårde i udkanten af byen. Abney Park Kirkegård var en af disse. Der var så en bevægelse for at fjerne gravstenene til kanterne af den gamle bys kirkegårde, re-inter ligene andre steder og slå kirkegårdene i haver og åbne rum, i stedet for at bygge på dem. Dette land i centrum af London var meget værdifuldt og spekulanter var ivrige efter at opnå det: Selv kvækerne havde bygget over en af deres kirkegårde og truede med at gøre det igen ved at bygge over Bunhill Fields. Octavia Hill havde et netværk af allierede i en halv snes felter, så hendes hjælp til at redde Church Bottom Wood må have været uvurderlig.<br/><br/>Metropolitan Gardens Society, der blev oprettet i 1882, havde lagt omkring to hundrede små haver i bycentre i 1890. De overdrog dem senere til de lokale myndigheder, så deres støtte til Churchyard Bottom Wood Appeal var sikret fra starten.<br/><br/>Kyrle Society er glemt nu, men havde i sin tid stor indflydelse på byplanlægning og Open Space lovgivning. Selskabet var blevet oprettet omkring 1875 for 'Skønhedens Udbredelse', for at bringe farve og interesse ind i livet for mennesker, der lever i kedelige, triste omgivelser. Bright farve til vægge og dekoration, god sang, åbne rum, Natur, Litteratur og Kunst. Der var en dekorativ gren, for hvem William Morris forelæste; en musikalsk gren for at fremme kor og glade aftener for folk i lokale skolebygninger; og en litteraturgren. Selskabet appellerede regelmæssigt ved breve i The Times til "de rigere klasser" for bøger og tidsskrifter, der skal distribueres til drenge- og pigeklubber, almissehuse og andre steder. Selve navnet 'Kyrle' kom fra Pope's The Man of Ross, filantropen, der gav sin fødeby til folket som en offentlig park. |
| With Thanksgiving around the corner, here are some festive file folder games we made for the girls. Both Thanksgiving games focus on math skills. And I'm grateful once again to my husband, Ed, for making all the clipart for me.<br/><br/>Thanksgiving Pattern Making<br/><br/>Like the name says, this game is about making patterns. Little ones just learning about patterns, can simply match the pictures onto the pattern strips, while others can continue the pattern with the picture cards on the blank strips.<br/><br/>To make the file folder, you want to cut out the grid of pictures to make the card pieces. I recommend laminating them to help them last longer. Then glue the pattern strips down on the file folder.<br/><br/>I wanted to have the blank pattern strips too so that the girls could see where to continue the pattern and how many to lay out. I attached them to the side of the folder using tape so that they could fold in to pack up the game and extend to layout the pattern.<br/><br/>I also added an extra blank one so that the girls could make their own pattern as well.<br/><br/>Turkey Number Game<br/><br/>In this game the girls add the feathers to the turkey body while practicing counting and number recognition. I used the colorless feathers to act as a guide for where to add the feathers and so that the girls could match the numbers. And be sure when gluing down the turkey body you only glue in the center so that the wing pieces can slide under the body.<br/><br/>Once all the feathers are laid out, we practice some simple arithmetic, such as taking away three feathers and seeing how many are left then adding two back to see what it equals.<br/><br/>In addition to black and white wings, we also included a colorless turkey in case you want to have the little ones color their own set. Instead of a file folder game you can turn this into a craft, coloring the pieces, cutting them out, and gluing them together.<br/><br/>Another option is to use the pieces to make a felt board story. We sometimes sing a turkey version of 10 Little Indians:<br/><br/>Like this:<br/><br/>Who Am I?<br/><br/>I think this is where I'm suppose to say something witty about myself. Oh well. I'm a stay-at-home mom to three awesome kids--our twin daughters who are seven now and a two-year-old son who is full of energy. In my pre-children life I was a teacher and I now homeschool our children. I'm also married to Ed, who is currently serving in the Air Force, and is the love of my life (it'd be awkward if he wasn't). Our family is big on books, crafts, and having fun together. I just thought I would share our activities in my own little corner of the internet.<br/><br/>Zoe appears to have it all--rich, handsome husband, easy New York life--but she made mistakes in her past and those mistakes are coming back up in her new life. I found myself on the edge of my seat for most of the book and was surprised...<br/><br/>I loved this book, I love the story, and I am grateful Margot Shetterly brought it to light. My only complaint was that I wished she discussed Katherine Johnson's role in the later missions a bit more but I guess the story had to end som...<br/><br/>I wanted to like this book and I did throughout most of it. Dana finds out her estranged husband and his girlfriend are found dead in the New Mexico desert. I was immediately drawn in by her character and the story. I really enjoyed seei... | Med Thanksgiving rundt om hjørnet, her er nogle festlige filmappespil, vi lavede til pigerne. Begge Thanksgiving-spil fokuserer på matematiske færdigheder. Og jeg er taknemmelig igen til min mand, Ed, for at lave alle clipart for mig.<br/><br/>Thanksgiving Mønster Making<br/><br/>Som navnet siger, handler dette spil om at lave mønstre. Små, der bare lærer om mønstre, kan simpelthen matche billederne på mønsterstrimlerne, mens andre kan fortsætte mønsteret med billedkortene på de tomme strimler.<br/><br/>For at gøre filmappen, du ønsker at skære ud gitteret af billeder for at gøre kortstykkerne. Jeg anbefaler laminering dem til at hjælpe dem med at vare længere. Lim derefter mønsteret strimler ned på filmappen.<br/><br/>Jeg ønskede også at have de blanke mønsterstrimler, så pigerne kunne se, hvor de skulle fortsætte mønsteret og hvor mange de skulle lægge ud. Jeg vedhæftede dem til siden af mappen ved hjælp af tape, så de kunne folde ind for at pakke spillet og udvide til layout mønsteret.<br/><br/>Jeg tilføjede også en ekstra blank, så pigerne også kunne lave deres eget mønster.<br/><br/>Tyrkiet Nummer Spil<br/><br/>I dette spil pigerne tilføje fjerene til kalkun kroppen, mens øve optælling og nummer anerkendelse. Jeg brugte de farveløse fjer til at fungere som en guide til, hvor at tilføje fjerene, og så pigerne kunne matche tallene. Og vær sikker på, når du limer kalkunkroppen ned, limer du kun i midten, så vingestykkerne kan glide under kroppen.<br/><br/>Når alle fjerene er lagt ud, praktiserer vi nogle enkle aritmetiske, såsom at tage væk tre fjer og se, hvor mange der er tilbage og derefter tilføje to tilbage for at se, hvad det svarer til.<br/><br/>Ud over sorte og hvide vinger inkluderede vi også en farveløs kalkun, hvis du vil have de små farve deres eget sæt. I stedet for en fil mappe spil kan du gøre dette til et håndværk, farve brikkerne, skære dem ud, og limning dem sammen.<br/><br/>En anden mulighed er at bruge stykkerne til at lave en filtbræthistorie. Vi synger nogle gange en kalkunversion af 10 Little Indians:<br/><br/>Sådan her:<br/><br/>Hvem er jeg?<br/><br/>Jeg tror, det er her, jeg skal sige noget vittigt om mig selv. Nå. Jeg er en hjemme-mor til tre fantastiske børn - vores tvillingedøtre, der er syv nu og en toårig søn, der er fuld af energi. I mit før-børns liv var jeg lærer, og jeg nu homeschool vores børn. Jeg er også gift med Ed, der i øjeblikket tjener i flyvevåbnet, og er mit livs kærlighed (det ville være akavet, hvis han ikke var). Vores familie er stor på bøger, håndværk og have det sjovt sammen. Jeg troede bare, at jeg ville dele vores aktiviteter i mit eget lille hjørne af internettet.<br/><br/>Zoe ser ud til at have det hele - rig, smuk mand, let New York liv - men hun begik fejl i sin fortid, og de fejl kommer tilbage i sit nye liv. Jeg befandt mig på kanten af min plads for det meste af bogen og blev overrasket ...<br/><br/>Jeg elskede denne bog, jeg elsker historien, og jeg er taknemmelig for, at Margot Shetterly bragte den frem i lyset. Min eneste klage var, at jeg ønskede, at hun diskuterede Katherine Johnsons rolle i de senere missioner lidt mere, men jeg tror, at historien måtte ende som ...<br/><br/>Jeg ønskede at kunne lide denne bog, og jeg gjorde gennem det meste af det. Dana finder ud af hendes fremmedgjorte mand og hans kæreste er fundet død i New Mexico ørkenen. Jeg blev straks tiltrukket af hendes karakter og historien. Jeg nød virkelig seei ... |
| Alcohol use by persons under age 21 has been identified as a major public health problem. Studies note that it increases the risks for disability, and may be detrimental to the developing brain. Minors who drink are more likely to commit suicide, break the law, or be victims of violence. Alcohol is implicated in nearly one-third of youth traffic fatalities. The total annual cost of underage drinking is estimated at $62 billion. While most laws intended to prevent underage drinking are passed at the state level, there has been legislative activity and interest at the federal level to support states' efforts to curb the problem. This report describes the extent of underage alcohol use, recent legislative activity on this issue, and various policy implications. It will be updated as new data become available. | Alkoholforbrug af personer under 21 år er blevet identificeret som et stort folkesundhedsproblem. Undersøgelser bemærker, at det øger risikoen for handicap og kan være skadeligt for den udviklende hjerne. Mindreårige, der drikker, er mere tilbøjelige til at begå selvmord, bryde loven eller blive ofre for vold. Alkohol er impliceret i næsten en tredjedel af unge trafikdødsfald. De samlede årlige omkostninger ved mindreårige drikker anslås til $ 62 milliarder. Mens de fleste love, der har til formål at forhindre mindreårige drikker, er vedtaget på statsligt niveau, har der været lovgivningsaktivitet og interesse på føderalt niveau for at støtte staternes bestræbelser på at bremse problemet. Denne rapport beskriver omfanget af mindreåriges alkoholforbrug, den seneste lovgivningsaktivitet om dette spørgsmål og forskellige politiske konsekvenser. Den vil blive opdateret, efterhånden som nye data bliver tilgængelige. |
| Tag Archives: real food<br/><br/>Last week I wrote about the Nordic Food Manifesto, and how Denmark created a strong "real food" culture largely from an intentional effort led by Claus Meyer. It wasn't political lobbying or public petitioning that resulted in food reform, but rather a grassroots effort led by citizens with the power to actually implement and follow-through with change.<br/><br/>I ended the post alluding to one question: Why is it so hard for us to do this ourselves, as individuals? If an entire country can implement and spread a common view towards food, why can't we?<br/><br/>There's nothing really stopping us from mimicking Denmark's success. The problem is, we're inundated with so many messages about what we should be eating, and how we should be living, it's hard to know where to start. So rather than following successful frameworks that have been shown to work (like the Nordic Food Manifesto), most people jump from diet craze to diet craze, trying to find the "right way to eat."<br/><br/>But how did Claus Meyer succeed? What was the secret sauce that helped the Manifesto take hold? And is it reasonable to think we can apply those lessons to our own lives?

Det var ikke politisk lobbyvirksomhed eller offentlige andragender, der resulterede i fødevarereform, men snarere en græsrodsindsats ledet af borgere med magt til faktisk at gennemføre og følge op med forandring.<br/><br/>Jeg afsluttede indlægget med et spørgsmål: Hvorfor er det så svært for os at gøre det selv, som enkeltpersoner? Hvis et helt land kan implementere og sprede en fælles opfattelse af mad, hvorfor kan vi ikke?<br/><br/>Problemet er, at vi er oversvømmet med så mange budskaber om, hvad vi skal spise, og hvordan vi skal leve, det er svært at vide, hvor vi skal starte. Så i stedet for at følge succesfulde rammer, der har vist sig at fungere (som det nordiske fødevaremanifest), hopper de fleste fra kostdille til kostdille og forsøger at finde den "rigtige måde at spise på."<br/><br/>Men hvordan lykkedes Claus Meyer?
