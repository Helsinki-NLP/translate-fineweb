| Massage Therapy<br/><br/>Massage is perhaps one of the oldest healing traditions. Many ancient peoples – including the Ancient Greeks, Egyptians, Chinese and Indians – were convinced of the therapeutic properties of massage and used it to treat a variety of ailments.<br/><br/>Massage therapy is the practice of kneading or manipulating a person's muscles and other soft-tissue in order to improve their wellbeing or health. It is a form of manual therapy that includes holding, moving, and applying pressure to the muscles, tendons, ligaments and fascia.<br/><br/>The term 'massage therapy' is used to describe a wide variety of techniques that vary in the manner in which touch, pressure and the intensity of the treatment is applied.<br/><br/>Massage for treatment of some disorders<br/><br/>Research indicates that massage and myotherapy are effective in managing:<br/><br/>subacute/chronic low back pain<br/><br/>delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS)<br/><br/>anxiety<br/><br/>stress<br/><br/>soft tissue injuries<br/><br/>high blood pressure<br/><br/>insomnia.<br/><br/>They can also be effectively used to support people with:<br/><br/>a chronic disease<br/><br/>a life threatening illness such as cancer.<br/><br/>Benefits of massage<br/><br/>One of the immediate benefits of massage is a feeling of deep relaxation and calm. This occurs because massage prompts the release of endorphins – the brain chemicals (neurotransmitters) that produce feelings of wellbeing.<br/><br/>Levels of stress hormones, such as adrenalin, cortisol and norepinephrine, are also reduced. Studies indicate that high levels of stress hormones impair the immune system.<br/><br/>Some of the physical benefits of massage and myotherapy include:<br/><br/>reduced muscle tension<br/><br/>improved circulation<br/><br/>stimulation of the lymphatic system<br/><br/>reduction of stress hormones<br/><br/>relaxation<br/><br/>increased joint mobility and flexibility<br/><br/>improved skin tone<br/><br/>improved recovery of soft tissue injuries<br/><br/>heightened mental alertness<br/><br/>reduced anxiety and depression | Massageterapi<br/><br/>Massage er måske en af de ældste helbredende traditioner. Mange gamle folkeslag - herunder de gamle grækere, egyptere, kinesere og indianere - var overbeviste om de terapeutiske egenskaber ved massage og brugte det til at behandle en række lidelser.<br/><br/>Massage terapi er den praksis at ælte eller manipulere en persons muskler og andre bløde væv for at forbedre deres velvære eller sundhed. Det er en form for manuel terapi, der omfatter at holde, flytte og anvende pres på muskler, sener, ledbånd og fascia.<br/><br/>Udtrykket "massage terapi" bruges til at beskrive en bred vifte af teknikker, der varierer i den måde, hvorpå berøring, tryk og intensiteten af behandlingen anvendes.<br/><br/>Massage til behandling af nogle lidelser<br/><br/>Forskning viser, at massage og myoterapi er effektive til at styre:<br/><br/>subakut/kronisk lændesmerter<br/><br/>forsinket muskelømhed (DOMS)<br/><br/>angst<br/><br/>stress<br/><br/>blødt væv skader<br/><br/>højt blodtryk<br/><br/>søvnløshed.<br/><br/>De kan også effektivt bruges til at støtte folk med:<br/><br/>en kronisk sygdom<br/><br/>En livstruende sygdom som kræft.<br/><br/>Fordele ved massage<br/><br/>En af de umiddelbare fordele ved massage er en følelse af dyb afslapning og ro. Dette sker, fordi massage beder frigivelsen af endorfiner - hjernen kemikalier (neurotransmittere), der producerer følelser af velvære.<br/><br/>Niveauer af stresshormoner, såsom adrenalin, cortisol og noradrenalin, er også reduceret. Undersøgelser viser, at høje niveauer af stresshormoner svækker immunsystemet.<br/><br/>Nogle af de fysiske fordele ved massage og myoterapi omfatter:<br/><br/>Reduceret muskelspænding<br/><br/>Forbedret cirkulation<br/><br/>stimulering af lymfesystemet<br/><br/>Reduktion af stresshormoner<br/><br/>Afslapning<br/><br/>øget fælles mobilitet og fleksibilitet<br/><br/>Forbedret hudtone<br/><br/>forbedret genopretning af bløddelsskader<br/><br/>øget mental årvågenhed<br/><br/>Reduceret angst og depression |

| Mistakes happen and it can be a long road to recovery when it comes to rebuilding credit.<br/><br/>The Shopping Cart trick is useful for people who have:<br/><br/>1. Declared bankruptcy in the past and is trying to recover 2. Defaulted on payments in the past 3. A lot of credit inquiries and doesn't want to add more inquiries 4. Made late payments in the past and had their accounts closed because of this 5. Someone who doesn't have a credit score at all<br/><br/>The caveat is If they ask you to enter your whole social security number, and not just the last 4, then it will most likely be a hard inquiry. With anything mentioned in this post, your mileage may vary, so it may work for some people and not for others.<br/><br/>If you use this method and have defaulted on payments in the past, be sure to pay off your bills every month.<br/><br/>The Shopping Cart Trick<br/><br/>The Shopping Cart Trick is visiting a website and waiting for a credit card offer to pop up when you check out. You do not need to purchase anything, it will appear before the payment page. This method only works for certain stores.<br/><br/>A few examples are Express, Overstock.com, and Williams-Sonoma. There are a few Synchrony cards like Walmart and QVC that work as well. Full list of stores can be found at the end of this post.<br/><br/>When you go through the process, be sure to have the ad blocker turned off and enter your real address. If the store can't match the last 4 digits of your SSN with your address, then the soft pull won't work. Again, you might have to go through the shopping process a few times before you receive an offer. You don't have to buy anything.<br/><br/>The credit limits might be lower for some people, but the idea is to rebuild your credit. If you do choose to go through this process, I recommend picking stores you will actually shop. It doesn't make sense to get a bonus or points at a store you don't shop at. Most, if not all of the cards, don't have annual fees, so they are good as foundation cards.<br/><br/>For me, this trick doesn't work out well because I don't frequent the listed shops often | Fejl sker, og det kan være en lang vej til genopretning, når det kommer til at genopbygge kredit.<br/><br/>Indkøbskurv tricket er nyttigt for folk, der har:<br/><br/>1. Erklæret konkurs i fortiden og forsøger at inddrive 2. Misligholdt på betalinger i fortiden 3. En masse kredit forespørgsler og ønsker ikke at tilføje flere forespørgsler 4. Lavet sene betalinger i fortiden og havde deres konti lukket på grund af dette 5. Nogen, der ikke har en kredit score på alle<br/><br/>Hvis de beder dig om at indtaste hele dit personnummer, og ikke kun den sidste 4, så vil det sandsynligvis være en hård forespørgsel. Med noget nævnt i dette indlæg kan din kilometertal variere, så det kan fungere for nogle mennesker og ikke for andre.<br/><br/>Hvis du bruger denne metode og har misligholdt betalinger i fortiden, skal du sørge for at betale dine regninger hver måned.<br/><br/>Indkøbskurven Trick<br/><br/>Indkøbskurven Trick besøger en hjemmeside og venter på et kreditkort tilbud om at dukke op, når du tjekker ud. Du behøver ikke at købe noget, det vises før betalingssiden. Denne metode virker kun for visse butikker.<br/><br/>Et par eksempler er Express, Overstock.com og Williams-Sonoma. Der er et par Synchrony-kort som Walmart og QVC, der også virker. Fuld liste over butikker kan findes i slutningen af dette indlæg.<br/><br/>Når du går gennem processen, skal du sørge for at have annonceblokkeren slukket og indtaste din rigtige adresse. Hvis butikken ikke kan matche de sidste 4 cifre i dit SSN med din adresse, vil det bløde træk ikke fungere. Igen, du måske nødt til at gå gennem indkøbsprocessen et par gange, før du modtager et tilbud. Du behøver ikke at købe noget.<br/><br/>Kreditgrænserne kan være lavere for nogle mennesker, men ideen er at genopbygge din kredit. Hvis du vælger at gå gennem denne proces, anbefaler jeg at vælge butikker, du faktisk vil shoppe. Det giver ikke mening at få en bonus eller point i en butik, du ikke handler i. De fleste, hvis ikke alle kortene, har ikke årlige gebyrer, så de er gode som grundkort.<br/><br/>For mig, dette trick fungerer ikke godt, fordi jeg ikke hyppigt de børsnoterede butikker ofte |
| Composition in Design – 15 Things You Can't Afford NOT to Know<br/><br/>Composition is one of the six crucial elements of design. Without strong and solid design composition, everything starts falling apart.<br/><br/>In this article we will give you 15 tips on how to strengthen your composition – no matter if it's a photography, illustration or any graphic design project.<br/><br/>We also prepared a beautiful collection of designs in the end, for your inspirarion. Enjoy!<br/><br/>1 . Direct the eye with leading lines<br/><br/>Usually, when you look at any visual, your eye falls first on particular object. In this case, this is the car and it is the focal point of the poster. We will talk a little bit more in our second point of the article. But if your eyes are immidiatelt attracted to certain part of visual, where do you look next? That is a tough question to start with, but a simple answer would be – you look where your eyes lead you. And your eyes lead you, where the designer uses leading lines to direct you through the layout. In this case, a leading line is the road. It also nicely frames the text on the left side and leads your eye back to the focal point of the poster.<br/><br/>Often lines can be more obvious then here, directly using arrows, flowcharts and are very useful method for explaining information and sequences.<br/><br/>2. Create focus in your design composition<br/><br/>A key element to design composition is having a strong focal point. No matter how many elements you have in your design, you have to stress and show the viewer, which is the most important part of your piece. In this case, the artist used color, contrast and scale to organize the space and create focal point. Keep in mind that the most important role of design is to communicate. Therefore, your focal point would be also your most important statement and message to your audience!<br/><br/>3. Use hierachy<br/><br/>Once that you've created your focal point, you have to figure out what to do with the rest of the elements of your design composition. Of course, you have structure these elements as well, and set a priority to them. In this example, the focal point is the man in the picture. Then, we have to look for a name of the event, what is the whole thing about. Only after that, we can keep looking for additional info, such as subheadings, dates, numbers, etc.<br/><br/>All this organization of the information with the help of size, color, weight is called hierachy.<br/><br/>4. Use complementing elements<br/><br/>Always seek to create unifed look throughout your entire design. It is not a good idea to mix and match images from different sources, with no simillarities in style between them. This will only tire the eyes of the viewer and confuse him/her.<br/><br/>This website design is a great example of cohesiveness between the images – they all have simple, one color background and the object are placed in the center. Of course, your design solution would depend on the specific project need.<br/><br/>In this case, you want the viewer to recognize and focus easily on the item to be bought, without any other distraction. The overal feel of the top image and color scheme is also repeated in the backgrounds of the products, so this is one more nice connection between the different parts of the design!<br/><br/>5. Repeat elements<br/><br/>Often your projects will consist of more than one page. If you repeat specific elements from one section of your design to another, you will help the viewer to orientate himself/ herself easier across the design.<br/><br/>Repeating elements are often used to create a certain theme as well and again, help the designcomposition to "stick together".<br/><br/>Some of the repeating elements you could use are: graphic motifs, type, cetrain layout reused in the different pages/parts of your project.<br/><br/>6. Balance elements<br/><br/>There are two types of balance in design composition – symmetrical and asymmetrical. The first uses similar elements, mirrored (distributed equally) on the both sides of an axis (visible or non-visible line). Symmetrical balance is very clean and elegant, but sometimes it can get a bit boring, so then, designers prefer asymmetrical balance instead. Obviously, in this scenario we won't have equal in size elements, placed in similar way.<br/><br/>Here, we look at the different sizes of the elements, the textures and so on. It helps to think of a design elements, as they have "weight". Larger elements would be "heavier". For example, if you have a big, "heavy", vertically pointing pumpkin, you can "balance" it out by using several horizontal lines and smaller objects on the opposite side of the "heavy" object.<br/><br/>7. Align elements<br/><br/>Alignment is another important tool to use in design composition and organize your elements. It often comes handy wen you have a lot of types, colors, images, headings and subheadings. There are many tools on the web, which can help you to snap and align elements to each other, leaving no room for floating pieces and messy design. Alignment brings an elegant vibe to a design. Even the most asymetric designs have some sorts of alignment and structuring of similar blocks of content.<br/><br/>It is a general rule, that when you have a long blocks of texts, left alignment would help the eye to scan more easily teh content. This poster is great visualization of this concept.<br/><br/>8. Use contrast<br/><br/>Contrast is used for drawing attention. If you boost the contrast of an element, this will make it pop. On the contrary, using elements with lower contrast will make them fade and "disappear".<br/><br/>Here, the contrast underlines the strong, geometic, bold architectural forms and the play of light and shadow. Not on last place, the small figure might be with lower contrast, compared to other elements, but it is still visible and nicely balances out the big, dark shape at the opposite, top left corner.<br/><br/>9. Use white space<br/><br/>White space is unreplacable tool in bringing clarity into your design composition. White space is not an "empty space", but necessary element, allowing your design to breathe. It also helps emphasizing the subject of interest.<br/><br/>For example, in this photo, all the white space (unoccupied by other elements) helps to focus all the attention on the woman figure and her posture. Do you think you would pay attention to this woman, if the image was filled in with many other elements? To help you understand the importance of white space, thinks of your own room. How would you feel if you have only one small passage from the door to the bed and everything is piled up with objects? How would you feel, if your bed doesn't not fill the whole room and there are no objects all around the place. Yes, you get the ideas – we all need space, even the design does.<br/><br/>10. Understand and use type of layouts<br/><br/>The first one we are going to look at is the so called, big photo or single visual layout which was was very popular for web designers in the recent years. It gives elegant, clean look, usually highlights a product or service with the help of single high-quality, engaging photo. This type of layout gives a sense of space. As you can suggest, it is not commonly used for news sites, where there is a lot of information to be presented. Here key phrase is quality over quantity.<br/><br/>Key elements to this type of layout are white space and simple typo.<br/><br/>Another type of layout is the Z layout. This is where the eye of the viewer is lead from one element of the design to other.<br/><br/>In this example we naturally first look at the photo, than our eyes are drawn to the text on the right side of the visual and then we continue scanning down, jumping from visual to text. Z layouts create rhythm and are often used on website with lot of information, where you have to orientate the user and "guide" him.<br/><br/>Another way to keep things nice, neat and organized is to use the so called golden ratio or rule of thirds. You can read more about in our article for taking amazing photos, where the same principle applies to photography. In short, dividing your layout into thirds – both vertically and horizontally and placing most important elements where these lines cross, will make your design more visually pleasing.<br/><br/>The example here is MailChimp's website. Notice how the monkey character is slightly to the left? It simply looks good! Oh, and one more thing – when you move a character across space, move it from left to right.<br/><br/>11. Create movement<br/><br/>Movement is change of place or position, an effort. It can be actual motion or it can be implied — arranging parts of the image so that the viewer gets a sense of motion by using lines, shapes, forms, textures, etc.<br/><br/>Since ancient times our eyes are more attracted to moving objects than still ones, and this was important for one's survival – in hunting and protecting yourself from animals. That is why, people are very attracted to images that depict movement and respectively, a composition with nice "flow" of elements is more intriguing.<br/><br/>12. People like triangles<br/><br/>The shape of triangle creates interest, sets a direction and creates movement. Surely, it is a very strong shape and designers and artists use it to organize their layout as well, and not only as visual element. In the recent years, it became hugely popular with the polygon design.<br/><br/>13. Simplification<br/><br/>Simplification is the technique of reducing a composition to only the most essential elements that support the visual statement.<br/><br/>If every part is equally important, then every part is equally unimportant. Nathan Fowkes<br/><br/>It is natural for the eyes to look at details, but it is very hard to see the design as whole and how all elements work together. When in doubt, better remove elements from your design composition, rather adding and trying to find a place for them. We know it's a cliche – but it is still legit "Less is more"!<br/><br/>14. See where your elements are in relation to edges<br/><br/>Often, you will see designers using blank space around the edges of the layout, giving the design room to breathe. Again it is natural to the eye to see elements receeding around edges and fading out. If it is busy around the edges in your design – the overal feel would be of something heavy, big and it will take away from the attention of central elements.<br/><br/>In this case, the designer used large, abstract shape to underline the typo – yeard and names. Because the shape is directing the eye, varied in thickness and has sense of movement to it, it doesn't overwhelm the viewer, but on the contrary – offers him/her aesthetic pleasure and simplicity.<br/><br/>15. Mind the transitions<br/><br/>Transition in design composition is a little bit harder to define. We discussed repetition already, in comparison, transition handles the natural flow from one shape to another, leading the eye from one spot to another. Often, designers use curved lines and shapes to smoothen transition from more angular shapes and blocks of content. Transition helps to relax the eye and "soften" the design.<br/><br/>Looking for some inspiration?<br/><br/>Now that you learnt something about the most important ingredients of good design composition, we made a small gallery with design compositions we find inspiring. Enjoy | Sammensætning i design - 15 ting du ikke har råd til ikke at vide<br/><br/>Sammensætning er et af de seks afgørende elementer i design. Uden stærk og solid designsammensætning begynder alt at falde fra hinanden.<br/><br/>I denne artikel vil vi give dig 15 tips til, hvordan du styrker din komposition – uanset om det er et fotografi, illustration eller et grafisk designprojekt.<br/><br/>Vi har også forberedt en smuk samling af designs i sidste ende, til din inspiration. Nyd!<br/><br/>1 . Direkte øjet med førende linjer<br/><br/>Normalt, når du ser på noget visuelt, falder dit øje først på et bestemt objekt. I dette tilfælde er dette bilen, og det er omdrejningspunktet for plakaten. Vi vil tale lidt mere i vores andet punkt i artiklen. Men hvis dine øjne er umiddelbare tiltrukket af visse dele af visuelle, hvor ser du næste? Det er et svært spørgsmål til at begynde med, men et simpelt svar ville være – du ser hvor dine øjne fører dig. Og dine øjne fører dig, hvor designeren bruger ledende linjer til at lede dig gennem layoutet. I dette tilfælde er en førende linje vejen. Det rammer også teksten på venstre side og fører dit øje tilbage til plakatens fokuspunkt.<br/><br/>Ofte linjer kan være mere indlysende så her, direkte ved hjælp af pile, flowcharts og er meget nyttig metode til at forklare oplysninger og sekvenser.<br/><br/>2. Skab fokus i din designsammensætning<br/><br/>Et centralt element i designsammensætning er at have et stærkt fokuspunkt. Uanset hvor mange elementer du har i dit design, skal du understrege og vise seeren, som er den vigtigste del af dit stykke. I dette tilfælde brugte kunstneren farve, kontrast og skala til at organisere rummet og skabe omdrejningspunkt. Husk på, at den vigtigste rolle for design er at kommunikere. Derfor vil dit omdrejningspunkt også være dit vigtigste udsagn og budskab til dit publikum!<br/><br/>3. Brug hierachy<br/><br/>Når du har oprettet dit fokuspunkt, skal du finde ud af, hvad du skal gøre med resten af elementerne i din designsammensætning. Selvfølgelig har du også strukturere disse elementer og prioritere dem. I dette eksempel er omdrejningspunktet manden i billedet. Derefter skal vi kigge efter et navn på begivenheden, hvad er det hele om. Først efter det kan vi fortsætte med at lede efter yderligere info, såsom underoverskrifter, datoer, tal osv.<br/><br/>Al denne organisering af oplysningerne ved hjælp af størrelse, farve, vægt kaldes hierachy.<br/><br/>4. Brug supplerende elementer<br/><br/>Altid søge at skabe unifed udseende i hele dit design. Det er ikke en god ide at blande og matche billeder fra forskellige kilder, uden lignelser i stil mellem dem. Dette vil kun trætte øjnene af seeren og forvirre ham / hende.<br/><br/>Denne hjemmeside design er et godt eksempel på sammenhængskraft mellem billederne – de har alle enkel, én farve baggrund og objektet er placeret i midten. Selvfølgelig, dit design løsning ville afhænge af det specifikke projekt behov.<br/><br/>I dette tilfælde vil du have seeren til at genkende og fokusere nemt på det element, der skal købes, uden nogen anden distraktion. Den overordnede fornemmelse af det øverste billede og farveskemaet gentages også i produkternes baggrunde, så det er endnu en god forbindelse mellem de forskellige dele af designet!<br/><br/>5. Gentag elementer<br/><br/>Ofte vil dine projekter bestå af mere end én side. Hvis du gentager specifikke elementer fra en sektion af dit design til en anden, vil du hjælpe seeren til at orientere sig lettere på tværs af designet.<br/><br/>Gentagende elementer bruges ofte til at skabe et bestemt tema så godt og igen, hjælpe designsammensætningen til at "holde sammen".<br/><br/>Nogle af de gentagne elementer, du kan bruge, er: grafiske motiver, type, cetrain layout genbruges i de forskellige sider / dele af dit projekt.<br/><br/>6. Balanceelementer<br/><br/>Der er to typer af balance i design sammensætning - symmetrisk og asymmetrisk. Den første bruger lignende elementer, spejlet (fordelt ligeligt) på begge sider af en akse (synlig eller ikke-synlig linje). Symmetrisk balance er meget ren og elegant, men nogle gange kan det blive lidt kedeligt, så designere foretrækker asymmetrisk balance i stedet. Naturligvis vil vi i dette scenarie ikke have lige store elementer, placeret på samme måde.<br/><br/>Her ser vi på de forskellige størrelser af elementerne, teksturerne og så videre. Det hjælper med at tænke på et designelementer, da de har "vægt". Større elementer ville være "tyngre". For eksempel, hvis du har en stor, "tung", lodret pege græskar, kan du "balancere" det ud ved hjælp af flere vandrette linjer og mindre objekter på den modsatte side af den "tunge" objekt.<br/><br/>7. Juster elementer<br/><br/>Justering er et andet vigtigt værktøj til brug i design sammensætning og organisere dine elementer. Det ofte kommer handy wen du har en masse typer, farver, billeder, overskrifter og underoverskrifter. Der er mange værktøjer på nettet, som kan hjælpe dig med at snappe og justere elementer til hinanden, så der ikke er plads til flydende stykker og rodet design. Tilpasning giver en elegant stemning til et design. Selv de mest asymmetriske designs har nogle former for tilpasning og strukturering af lignende blokke af indhold.<br/><br/>Det er en generel regel, at når du har en lang blokke af tekster, venstre justering ville hjælpe øjet til at scanne lettere teh indhold. Denne plakat er stor visualisering af dette koncept.<br/><br/>8. Brug kontrast<br/><br/>Kontrast bruges til at tiltrække opmærksomhed. Hvis du øger kontrasten af et element, vil det få det til at poppe. Tværtimod vil brug af elementer med lavere kontrast få dem til at falme og "forsvinde".<br/><br/>Her understreger kontrasten de stærke, geometiske, dristige arkitektoniske former og lysets og skyggens spil. Ikke på sidstepladsen, den lille figur kan være med lavere kontrast i forhold til andre elementer, men det er stadig synligt og balancerer pænt ud den store, mørke form i det modsatte, øverste venstre hjørne.<br/><br/>9. Brug mellemrum<br/><br/>Hvidt rum er uudskifteligt værktøj til at bringe klarhed i din designsammensætning. Hvidt rum er ikke et "tomt rum", men nødvendigt element, så dit design kan trække vejret. Det hjælper også med at understrege emnet af interesse.<br/><br/>For eksempel på dette billede hjælper alle de hvide rum (ikke optaget af andre elementer) med at fokusere al opmærksomheden på kvindefiguren og hendes kropsholdning. Tror du, at du ville være opmærksom på denne kvinde, hvis billedet blev udfyldt med mange andre elementer? For at hjælpe dig med at forstå betydningen af hvid plads, tænker på dit eget værelse. Hvordan ville du føle, hvis du kun har en lille passage fra døren til sengen, og alt er stablet op med genstande? Hvordan ville du føle det, hvis din seng ikke fylder hele rummet, og der ikke er nogen objekter rundt omkring. Ja, du får ideerne - vi har alle brug for plads, selv designet gør.<br/><br/>10. Forstå og bruge typen af layouts<br/><br/>Den første, vi skal se på, er det såkaldte store foto eller enkelt visuelt layout, som var meget populært for webdesignere i de seneste år. Det giver elegant, rent udseende, fremhæver normalt et produkt eller en tjeneste ved hjælp af enkelt høj kvalitet, engagerende foto. Denne type layout giver en følelse af plads. Som du kan foreslå, er det ikke almindeligt anvendt til nyhedswebsteder, hvor der er en masse information, der skal præsenteres. Her er nøgleordet kvalitet over kvantitet.<br/><br/>Nøgleelementer til denne type layout er hvid plads og simpel skrivefejl.<br/><br/>En anden type layout er Z-layoutet. Det er her seerens øje ledes fra et element i designet til et andet.<br/><br/>I dette eksempel ser vi naturligvis først på billedet, end vores øjne er tiltrukket af teksten på højre side af det visuelle, og så fortsætter vi med at scanne ned og hoppe fra visuel til tekst. Z layouts skaber rytme og bruges ofte på hjemmeside med masser af information, hvor man skal orientere brugeren og "guide" ham.<br/><br/>En anden måde at holde tingene pæne, pæne og organiserede er at bruge det såkaldte gyldne forhold eller reglen om tredjedele. Du kan læse mere om i vores artikel for at tage fantastiske billeder, hvor det samme princip gælder for fotografering. Kort sagt, at opdele dit layout i tredjedele - både lodret og vandret og placere de vigtigste elementer, hvor disse linjer krydser, vil gøre dit design mere visuelt tiltalende.<br/><br/>Eksemplet her er MailChimps hjemmeside. Læg mærke til, hvordan abekarakteren er lidt til venstre? Det ser simpelthen godt ud! Åh, og en ting mere - når du flytter et tegn over rummet, skal du flytte det fra venstre til højre.<br/><br/>11. Opret bevægelse<br/><br/>Bevægelse er forandring af sted eller position, en indsats. Det kan være faktisk bevægelse eller det kan være underforstået - arrangere dele af billedet, så beskueren får en følelse af bevægelse ved hjælp af linjer, former, former, teksturer osv.<br/><br/>Siden oldtiden vores øjne er mere tiltrukket af bevægelige objekter end stillestående, og det var vigtigt for ens overlevelse – i jagt og beskytte dig selv fra dyr. Derfor er folk meget tiltrukket af billeder, der skildrer bevægelse og henholdsvis en sammensætning med flot "flow" af elementer er mere spændende.<br/><br/>12. Folk kan lide trekanter<br/><br/>Formen af trekant skaber interesse, sætter en retning og skaber bevægelse. Sikkert er det en meget stærk form, og designere og kunstnere bruger det også til at organisere deres layout, og ikke kun som visuelt element. I de senere år blev det enormt populært med polygondesignet.<br/><br/>13. Forenkling<br/><br/>Forenkling er teknikken til at reducere en sammensætning til kun de mest væsentlige elementer, der understøtter den visuelle erklæring.<br/><br/>Hvis alle dele er lige vigtige, er alle dele lige uvigtige. Nathan Fowkes<br/><br/>Det er naturligt for øjnene at se på detaljer, men det er meget svært at se designet som helhed, og hvordan alle elementer arbejder sammen. Når du er i tvivl, skal du bedre fjerne elementer fra din designsammensætning, i stedet for at tilføje og forsøge at finde et sted for dem. Vi ved, at det er en kliché - men det er stadig legit "Mindre er mere"!<br/><br/>14. Se hvor dine elementer er i forhold til kanter<br/><br/>Ofte vil du se designere, der bruger tom plads omkring kanterne af layoutet, hvilket giver designrummet plads til at trække vejret. Igen er det naturligt for øjet at se elementer, der går rundt om kanterne og falmer ud. Hvis det er travlt omkring kanterne i dit design - den overordnede fornemmelse ville være af noget tungt, stort, og det vil tage væk fra opmærksomheden af centrale elementer.<br/><br/>I dette tilfælde brugte designeren stor, abstrakt form til at understrege typo - yeard og navne. Fordi formen dirigerer øjet, varierer i tykkelse og har en følelse af bevægelse, overvælder den ikke beskueren, men tværtimod – giver ham/hende æstetisk nydelse og enkelhed.<br/><br/>15. Mind overgange<br/><br/>Overgang i designsammensætning er lidt sværere at definere. Vi diskuterede gentagelse allerede i sammenligning, overgang håndterer det naturlige flow fra en form til en anden, der fører øjet fra et sted til et andet. Ofte bruger designere buede linjer og former til at udjævne overgangen fra mere kantede former og blokke af indhold. Overgang hjælper med at slappe af øjet og "blødgøre" designet.<br/><br/>Søger du inspiration?<br/><br/>Nu hvor du har lært noget om de vigtigste ingredienser i god designsammensætning, har vi lavet et lille galleri med designsammensætninger, som vi finder inspirerende. |

| Memory CD8+ T cells are essential cells of the immune system, retained post infection to protect from subsequent immunological insults. Many transcriptional regulators and some proximal signaling cascades associated with both naive and memory T cells have been described and have greatly informed the process by which immunological memory is formed. Despite clear differences in transcription factor expression and cytokine requirements, how global signal transduction induced by antigen binding differs between naive and memory CD8+ T cells is completely unknown and thus represents a significant gap in our knowledge base. One key signaling event that occurs in response to TCR stimulation is the activation of kinases that phosphorylate tyrosine residues on downstream signaling proteins. Therefore, comparing the phosphotyrosine signaling networks between naive and memory T cells will identify targets for modulation of the CD8+ T cell immune response to positively influence response to disease and vaccine efficacy. The objective of this specific proposal is to determine the intracellular signaling pathways that are unique to restimulated memory CD8+ T cells. Our central hypothesis is that distinct signal transduction pathways regulate the memory CD8+ T cell response. The rationale and scientific premise for the proposed work is that understanding at a global proteomic level the changes that occur in T cells as they differentiate from naive to memory T cells will enable more efficacious vaccine and drug treatment design to combat disease and infection. We will test our central hypothesis with the following specific aims: 1) Determine the TCR signal transduction changes that occur in CD8+ nave and memory T cells. To profile kinase signaling networks, we will utilize a highly sensitive quantitative mass spectrometric assay we developed on naive, effector and memory CD8+ T cells. Based on a preliminary screen, we identified that Jak2 is hyperphosphorylated, indicating it is a key mediator of the recall response. We will test the hypothesis that Jak2 hyperactivation is critical for memory recall responses. Together, the completion of Aim1 will identify novel signaling networks that contribute to CD8+ memory recall responses and 2) Defining phosphorylation of CREB binding protein (CBP) as a molecular switch that regulates transcriptional networks in memory CD8+ T cells. Given our preliminary data in which we uncovered unique signaling pathways associated with CD8+ memory T cell formation, we hypothesize that in memory CD8+ T cells, increased Jak2 activation drives phosphorylation of CBP to promote a unique transcriptional landscape versus a nave T cell. We will identify how phosphorylation of CBP regulates binding of transcription factors such as CREB and MYB. Additionally, we will take a genetic approach to determine how CBP functions in the formation of CD8+ memory cells and CD8+ memory recall responses. Together, data obtained in this Aim2 will establish a novel mechanism that explains how changes in tyrosine kinase activity associated with CD8+ T cell memory formation drive unique transcriptional programs.<br/><br/>Public Health Relevance<br/><br/>The studies proposed herein will determine, using mass spectrometry, the signal transduction events that take place in memory CD8+ T cells upon restimulation, relative to nave CD8+ T cells. Given that these cells play an essential role in protection from secondary infection, it is imperative that we understand the molecular mechanisms by which these cells exert their effector function for the protection of human health. | Hukommelse CD8 + T-celler er vigtige celler i immunsystemet, bevaret efter infektion for at beskytte mod efterfølgende immunologiske fornærmelser. Mange transkriptionelle regulatorer og nogle proksimale signalkaskader forbundet med både naive og hukommelse T-celler er blevet beskrevet og har i høj grad informeret den proces, hvorved immunologisk hukommelse dannes. På trods af klare forskelle i transkriptionsfaktorudtryk og cytokinkrav, hvordan global signaltransduktion induceret af antigenbinding adskiller sig mellem naive og hukommelses CD8 + T-celler er helt ukendt og repræsenterer således et betydeligt hul i vores videnbase. En vigtig signalhændelse, der opstår som reaktion på TCR-stimulation, er aktiveringen af kinaser, der fosforylerer tyrosinrester på nedstrøms signalproteiner. Derfor vil sammenligning af phosphotyrosin signalnetværk mellem naive og hukommelse T-celler identificere mål for graduering af CD8 + T-celle immunrespons til positivt at påvirke respons på sygdom og vaccine effektivitet. Formålet med dette specifikke forslag er at bestemme de intracellulære signalveje, der er unikke for restimulerede hukommelse CD8 + T-celler. Vores centrale hypotese er, at forskellige signaltransduktionsveje regulerer hukommelsen CD8 + T-cellerespons. Begrundelsen og den videnskabelige forudsætning for det foreslåede arbejde er, at forståelse på globalt proteomisk niveau de ændringer, der opstår i T-celler, da de adskiller sig fra naive til hukommelse T-celler vil muliggøre mere effektiv vaccine og lægemiddelbehandling design til bekæmpelse af sygdom og infektion. Vi vil teste vores centrale hypotese med følgende specifikke mål: 1) Bestem TCR-signaltransduktionsændringer, der forekommer i CD8 + nave og hukommelse T-celler. Til profil kinase signalering netværk, vil vi udnytte en meget følsom kvantitativ massespektrometrisk analyse, vi udviklede på naive, effektor og hukommelse CD8 + T-celler. Baseret på en foreløbig skærm identificerede vi, at Jak2 er hyperfosforyleret, hvilket indikerer, at det er en nøglemediator for tilbagekaldelsesresponset. Vi vil teste hypotesen om, at Jak2 hyperaktivering er kritisk for hukommelsesgenkaldelsesresponser. Sammen vil færdiggørelsen af Aim1 identificere nye signalnetværk, der bidrager til CD8 + hukommelsesgenkaldelsesresponser og 2) Definere fosforylering af CREB-bindende protein (CBP) som en molekylær switch, der regulerer transkriptionelle netværk i hukommelses CD8 + T-celler. I betragtning af vores foreløbige data, hvor vi afdækkede unikke signalveje forbundet med CD8 + hukommelse T-celledannelse, antager vi, at i hukommelse CD8 + T-celler øger Jak2-aktivering fosforylering af CBP for at fremme et unikt transkriptionelt landskab versus en nave T-celle. Vi vil identificere, hvordan fosforylering af CBP regulerer binding af transkriptionsfaktorer som CREB og MYB. Derudover vil vi tage en genetisk tilgang til at bestemme, hvordan CBP fungerer i dannelsen af CD8 + hukommelsesceller og CD8 + hukommelsesgenkaldelsesresponser. Sammen vil data opnået i denne Aim2 etablere en ny mekanisme, der forklarer, hvordan ændringer i tyrosinkinaseaktivitet forbundet med CD8 + T-cellehukommelsesdannelse driver unikke transkriptionsprogrammer.<br/><br/>Folkesundhedsrelevans<br/><br/>De undersøgelser, der foreslås heri, vil bestemme, ved hjælp af massespektrometri, de signaltransduktionshændelser, der finder sted i hukommelses CD8 + T-celler ved restimulering, i forhold til nav CD8 + T-celler. Da disse celler spiller en væsentlig rolle i beskyttelsen mod sekundær infektion, er det bydende nødvendigt, at vi forstår de molekylære mekanismer, hvormed disse celler udøver deres effektorfunktion til beskyttelse af menneskers sundhed. |
