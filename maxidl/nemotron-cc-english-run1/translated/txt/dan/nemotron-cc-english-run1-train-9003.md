| The Masterpiece: a Chain Poetry Challenge<br/><br/>John has been writing poetry since his school days. He was awarded the "Best Poet 2014 and 2021" Hubby Awards.<br/><br/>Madame Monet in a Japanese kimono, 1875<br/><br/>Claude Monet [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>A Brief History of Collaborative, Collective, or Chain Poetry<br/><br/>Collaborative,collective, or chain poetry is an alternative and creative technique for writing poetry by more than one person. The principal aim of this type of poetry is to create poems through the collaboration of various authors/poets, trying to form a unified voice while still maintain their individual voices.<br/><br/>Examples of collaboration abound in Japanese poetry. Though the precise accounts and records of many such events are either lost or missing.<br/><br/>One of the most famous examples of collective poetry writing was the poem collection titled Ralentir Travaux by Surrealist French poets André Breton, Paul Éluard and René Char. These three poets collaborated to write the poems in this collection over just five days in 1930.<br/><br/>During the 1940s, Charles Henri Ford, an American poet, invented what he called the "chain poem", where each poet wrote a line and then sent the poem to another person (to continue) in another part of the world, by post.<br/><br/>In 2007 a collection of American collaborative poetry Saints of Hysteria: A Half-Century of Collaborative American Poetry was edited and published by Denise Duhamel, Maureen Seaton and David Trinidad.<br/><br/>Collaborative poetry writing has been used in schools and colleges to teach students teamwork and to discover ways in which they are connected.(source: Wikipedia)<br/><br/>Study of a Figure Outdoors: Woman with a Parasol, facing left, 1886<br/><br/>Claude Monet [Public domain or Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>The Aim of This Article and How to Approach the Challenge<br/><br/>A few years back I wrote an article called "Poem Without an End" which included a Christmas poem I had written that lent itself to being added to. I was amazed by the response as at that stage I only had a few followers here. People wrote a stanza of poetry each in "comments" on the hub to follow on from the previous commenter's stanza. It worked out very well and at the end I compiled all the contributions into a single poem as part of the hub.<br/><br/>Similar challenges have been issued since, including one by Frank Atanacio called "Spirits Sat as Mourners" that was also very successful. The difference being that in that instance contributors wrote their own hubs for their stanza of poetry and placed a link on Frank's original hub.<br/><br/>For this particular challenge I don't expect everyone to spend valuable time writing separate hubs for one stanza of poetry (unless you really want to). The main problem being that to make it effective you would have to copy the previously written parts of the poem onto your hub and would probably be hit with "duplication" label.<br/><br/>So, that being the case, and also to save having to leave links everywhere, I just ask that anyone who wants to take part just write their stanza here in "comments." Check the last comment before yours that is contributing to the challenge and follow on. If I see more than one following from the same stanza I will use my poetic licence to work them in as I deem best.<br/><br/>At some stage when I feel there has been enough stanzas added I will probably call an end to the challenge and then compile them all together as the completed poem as part of the article (also giving credit to each contributor).<br/><br/>Flowered Riverbank, Argenteuil<br/><br/>Claude Monet [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>The Challenge!<br/><br/>Now comes the interesting part. If you join this chain poetry challenge you have to try to keep the style and voice of the poem as close as possible to the preceding verses, so that to uninformed readers it will appear that only one author has written the entire poem.<br/><br/>Sounds easy, you say? Well maybe it would be if the poem had a traditional style, rhyme or meter. But this one doesn't! The poem you will be adding to was started by an acquaintance of mine Andriealphus as a "chain poem challenge" elsewhere. At the time of writing I was the only other person who had accepted the challenge, and because I loved the subject I thought it would be a great challenge for my fellow writers and decided to use it here and see if the response would be better. (I know of a few poets here whose writing would suit this style)<br/><br/>Rules :<br/><br/>Follow on from the previous stanza in comments<br/><br/>Try to retain the voice and style of the poem<br/><br/>Keep your stanza/verse to approximately the same length as those before<br/><br/>Claude Monet was one of the most famous painters in the history of art and a leading figure in the Impressionist movement.<br/><br/>In 1883 Monet moved to Giverny. Here, he loved to paint outdoors in the gardens that he helped create. The water lilies found in the pond had a particular appeal, and he painted several series of them throughout the rest of his life; the Japanese-style bridge over the pond became the subject of several works, as well.<br/><br/>In 1912 Monet painted a series of 12 waterlily paintings commissioned by the Orangerie des Tuileries, a museum in Paris. He chose to make them on a very large scale, and to serve as a "haven of peaceful meditation." This project consumed much of Monet's later years. Monet once stated, "These landscapes of water and reflection have become an obsession for me. It is beyond my strength as an old man, and yet I want to render what I feel."<br/><br/>His health was now an obstacle, as well. Nearly blind, with both of his eyes seriously affected by cataracts, Monet finally agreed to undergo surgery for the ailment in 1923.<br/><br/>Monet's famous water lilies turned redder as his cataracts progressed. After getting corrective surgery he destroyed most of the "red lily" paintings, angry that no one really mentioned it to him. Ironically, these paintings were probably what made his impressionistic style so famous in that time -- artists started taking more risks with color and such during this point. (source: biography.com)<br/><br/>The Masterpiece<br/><br/>"The boy sitting behind you says you look like a masterpiece.<br/><br/>Ask him, has he ever seen a Monet up close?<br/><br/>Close enough to see nothing but muddled strokes of weedy lakeshore?<br/><br/>Close enough to dip his fingers into the ridges<br/><br/>where oil paints hardened under an artist's gaze?<br/><br/>Close enough to breathe onto the blood lilies?<br/><br/>Ask him, why did he paint them red?" (Andriealphus)<br/><br/>He grinned like Carroll's cheshire cat.<br/><br/>"Through clouded and bloodshot eyes I imagine.<br/><br/>Be my waterlilies!" he says,<br/><br/>"Feel my breath and let my fingers delve,<br/><br/>become my masterpiece instead.<br/><br/>A brush has never touched a canvas as fine as your fair skin.<br/><br/>Let the masters weep in jealousy,<br/><br/>and Van Gogh slice his ear in envy at the beauty of your nakedness."(Jodah)<br/><br/>Self portrait with bandaged ear<br/><br/>Vincent van Gogh [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>Responses<br/><br/>Now it's your turn. Please write your response in the comments below, remembering to check those immediately before yours for the last written stanza of the poem. If you do decide to write a separate hub for your stanza of verse, make sure you leave a link here in comments.<br/><br/>The Finished Masterpiece<br/><br/>All contributions have been received and I have put the finished poem together with only some slight edits. I hope everyone is happy with the result. If you think I could improve the order of stanzas etc, feel free to let me know.<br/><br/>Comments<br/><br/>Hey Diana, looks like I have to go add another stanza to the finished poem :)<br/><br/>Thanks for this contribution.Quite beautiful.<br/><br/>Diana L Pierce from Potter County, Pa. on September 19, 2015:<br/><br/>No tears splash water below,<br/><br/>From the bridge beneath his feet,<br/><br/>Nor can his brush paint his thoughts,<br/><br/>From the mystery maid he seeks.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 21, 2015:<br/><br/>Thank you Cris, I am sure everyone appreciates your comment.

And the beauty we can still enjoy today from all his work.<br/><br/>This is a great challenge! I am really looking forward to adding to this.<br/><br/>I first wanted to stop in and let you know that, up for sure. Shared too.<br/><br/>And thank you so much for all the challenges to help the rest of us, keep our mental energy flowing and giving it a work out! You are the best.<br/><br/>The information about LuLu and the free ISBN number is an answered prayer! So, smile my friend. You are a gift!<br/><br/>Hugs. :-)<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 12, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi again Marj. I think I may have all the verses that are going to come. I have been doing my best to arrange them as I think best with just a little editing. I will probably post the finished poem as a separate hub with a link on this one to it. My book is available on Lulu and iBooks...there's a link on one of the earlier comments. I'd really appreciate it if you were to purhase a copy. Bear in mind it's my first eBook so the formatting etc isn't perfect, but it's taken me seven revisions I think to get it where it is. It will all be easier next time. If you need help let me know.<br/><br/>travmaj from australia on August 12, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi John, you have certainly had some excellent responses to your challenge - I'm sure you'll fuse it altogether beautifully although I imagine a difficult task. I'm interested in your poetry books also - I really have to get my act together technologically - I'll try and check it all out...cheers -<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi Jo, both books 'On the Wings of Eagles" and "I Laughed a Smile" have mostly the same content...except the former has one extra poem. Originally they were in different formats, one ePub, the other PDF but now they are both ePub. They are available through Lulu and iBooks, soon Barnes and Noble and Nook (not Amazon). I may try publishing another book through Amazon soon just to see how it compares. Thanks again.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>John, thanks a lot, the info on publishing with Lulu will be quite useful as I'm thinking of publishing but I'm currently torn between Amazon and Lulu. I wanted to purchase one of your books, but I couldn't seem to find them on Amazon. However, I'll probably get it from Lulu. Wishing you every success, you deserve it.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Hey Phyllis, thanks for ontributing. I like it, a perfect ending to the poem I think.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks Faith.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi Jo, I think I have sorted out the poem satisfactorily. Just waiting to see if there is any more to add. Publishing with Lulu wasn't bad and now that I've done it once it will be easier next time. Getting the formatting to look right in the eBook was the hardest, though you and just type it in a word document and Lulu automatically produces the contents page and converts the document to ePub or PDF you can only use certain fonts and have to make sure the chapter names or poem titles are in Heading 1. They also provide a free ISBN number if you want. Overall it was easier than expected however.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Phyllis, this is succinct and beautiful, I love it. Shyron's did an excellent job also, I thought I'd already commented on her verse, but I hadn't.<br/><br/>Phyllis Doyle Burns from High desert of Nevada. on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Wonderful hub, great idea, Jodah. Here is one from me. Short but sweet. Hope it is okay:<br/><br/>And this the beauty be<br/><br/>From Masters past we see<br/><br/>Impressed upon the boy<br/><br/>Bestowed on her with joy<br/><br/>Faith Reaper from southern USA on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks John and Jo. You are kind. Jo, you have always been a brilliant poet. I, too, am looking forward to the end result after John does his magic to pull it all together.<br/><br/>I will share again to see if there are any more takers.<br/><br/>Blessings<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Faith, beautifully done, I find it incredible how someone with such limited vision can teach us so much about beauty, light and shadows. John, looking forward to reading the end result.<br/><br/>By the way, congtats on publishing your poems. How did you find the process of publishing with Lulu?<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks for your great submission Faith. No it's not too late, I'm still compiling the final poem so it should be up for all to see in a day or two.<br/><br/>Faith Reaper from southern USA on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi John,<br/><br/>I apologize for my late submission here to your wonderful challenge. I am off from work a couple of day and decided to give this a go while my husband is resting from knee surgery. If it does not meet with your standards, please feel free to not use it in your final poem or edit as you deem necessary.<br/><br/>Blessings always<br/><br/>Here it goes:<br/><br/>Confessions to friend Georges Clemenceau<br/><br/>Of light encapsulating both torment, joy<br/><br/>Fervent madness in analyzing colors<br/><br/>Consequential spontaneous creations<br/><br/>Season after season of obsession<br/><br/>Capturing different hues in a single moment<br/><br/>Attentive while strolling in Argenteuill<br/><br/>Brushwork bares masterpiece.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 09, 2015:<br/><br/>Just a shout out to see if anyone else still wants to contribute to this chain poem. I have started compiling the stanzas together but will leave it open for a couple more days in case anyone else is intending to join in. Thanks to all who have contributed.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 02, 2015:<br/><br/>Thank you Genna. It appears Monet is a favourite arist of many here. I hope you'll take part in this challenge too :)<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 02, 2015:<br/><br/>Thank you for a great contribution Shyron. This is a very nice verse. Well done.<br/><br/>Genna East from Massachusetts, USA on August 02, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi John...<br/><br/>I started to read this wonderful challenge (Monet is one of my favorite artists), then came back to finish reading some of the beautiful contributions that give this painting a stunning voice through perception and the senses.

I'm so glad you like my contribution. This is a very good idea, I know you'll have fun putting it all together. Take care and my best to you.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks Deb, yes I am impressed by the standard of submissions. I'm looking forward to putting it all together.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Yes Ann, it is good to see the poets among us take up the challenge with some great contributions so far. I just hope Imcan do it justice when it comes to putting it together.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Well done Jo. The word "sublime" comes to mind. I hoped all the poets would rise to the fore, and they have. Love it, thanks for contributing.<br/><br/>Deb Hirt from Stillwater, OK on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>I am excited to see what you end up with here. There are a number of fine poets rising to the challenge, so go to it!<br/><br/>Ann Carr from SW England on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Great one, Jo!<br/><br/>You've got everyone going, John! Rather you than me, putting all this together, but it's going to be a humdinger of a poem when it finally comes to an end - if it ever does! You've really started something.<br/><br/>Ann<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Ok, John here goes nothing! Following from Kim's. I hope it reads well.<br/><br/>And the boy began to walk away<br/><br/>But in his wake, I heard him say<br/><br/>"I took a trip to Orangerie<br/><br/>Where the ghost of Monet still abides<br/><br/>I sat right down and gazed awhile<br/><br/>Until I heard a soft voice cry.<br/><br/>"Have you ever seen a fluid dream?<br/><br/>Where light evolves into what it touch<br/><br/>Where serenity flows through cloudy veil<br/><br/>Where the magician's brush like lightening rush<br/><br/>Have you ever seen a sight sublime?<br/><br/>A child born of distorted illusion<br/><br/>This flowering pond that traps the light<br/><br/>That lift the heart and beckons the soul<br/><br/>An abstract pulchritude up close<br/><br/>Move back, behold; such tranquil delight."<br/><br/>I hope this is in line with what the others have done. Feel free to edit if needed. My best...<br/><br/>Jo.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Alrighty!<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Yes Jo, please do. Anyone is welcome to do more than one stanza. I may add another myself at some stage.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>John, I've decided to have a go, but it's about 16 lines, can I do it in two stanzas following on from Kim's wonderful submission? You can always edit it later.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on July 31, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi Jo, sorry to hear you are under the weather at the moment. I am not in a hurry to close this challenge so I'll keep it open until you are back firing on all cylinders and are able to contribute. You are one of the hubbers I was looking forward to getting a response from as I thought it would suit. Thank you for your kind words, and get well soon.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on July 31, 2015:<br/><br/>Wow! John I can't believe I almost missed your incredible challenged. This is something in which I would have loved to participate since Claude Monet is one of my all times favourite artist. Unfortunately, I must cry off. I'm a bit under the weather with a head full of cotton wool, or so it seems. If the challenge is still open when I get rid of this pesky flu I may give it a go, but I must say, the standard is exceptionally high. Maj took it to another level but all the submissions are brilliant. Kudos to you Andriealphus and the other writers who participated so far in this artistic and creative masterpiece.<br/><br/>My best always Jo.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on July 31, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi again Maj, glad this poem inspired you, and yes it beats watching the cricket especially with the Aussie batsmen performing badly in this third test. It will be an interesting exercise for me to fuse all the stanzas together but should be good.<br/><br/>travmaj from australia on July 30, 2015:<br/><br/>John, thank you, I'm most happy you like my offering. I found the poem intriguing and suddenly felt inspired to write my version in the same mode. I'm not sure I wrote a continuation from the stanza before (alwaysexploring) but I'm sure you will fuse it altogether when the time comes. Love all the responses. I haven't managed any creative writing for yonks, can't wait now to start over, just need some time. (beats watching the cricket too!!!) Cheers John, will be checking in -<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on July 30, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks for checking Dana. I am pleased with the quality of responses so far. I just have to wait and see how many more come in. The final,poem should be great.<br/><br/>Dana Tate from LOS ANGELES on July 30, 2015:<br/><br/>Just checking in to see how things are going, I can't wait for the finished product. I attended a poetry class and we did this also it was really fun.<br/><br/>ocfireflies from North Carolina on July 29, 2015:<br/><br/>John,<br/><br/>Thanks so much for providing the platform for without that it is easy to fall down.<br/><br/>; ) Kim<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on July 29, 2015:<br/><br/>Thank you Devika.

Han blev tildelt "Bedste digter 2014 og 2021" Hubby Awards.<br/><br/>Madame Monet i en japansk kimono, 1875<br/><br/>Claude Monet [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>En kort historie om kollaborativ, kollektiv eller kædepoesi<br/><br/>Collaborative, kollektive eller kæde poesi er en alternativ og kreativ teknik til at skrive poesi af mere end én person. Hovedformålet med denne type poesi er at skabe digte gennem samarbejde mellem forskellige forfattere / digtere, der forsøger at danne en samlet stemme, mens de stadig opretholder deres individuelle stemmer.<br/><br/>Eksempler på samarbejde vrimler i japansk poesi. Selvom de præcise regnskaber og optegnelser af mange sådanne begivenheder er enten tabt eller mangler.<br/><br/>Et af de mest berømte eksempler på kollektiv poesiskrivning var digtsamlingen med titlen Ralentir Travaux af surrealistiske franske digtere André Breton, Paul Éluard og René Char. Disse tre digtere samarbejdede om at skrive digtene i denne samling over blot fem dage i 1930.<br/><br/>I løbet af 1940'erne opfandt Charles Henri Ford, en amerikansk digter, hvad han kaldte "kædedigtet", hvor hver digter skrev en linje og derefter sendte digtet til en anden person (for at fortsætte) i en anden del af verden, med post.<br/><br/>I 2007 blev en samling af amerikanske kollaborative poesi Saints of Hysteria: A Half-Century of Collaborative American Poetry redigeret og udgivet af Denise Duhamel, Maureen Seaton og David Trinidad.<br/><br/>Samarbejdsdigtning er blevet brugt i skoler og gymnasier til at lære eleverne teamwork og at opdage måder, hvorpå de er forbundet.<br/><br/>Studie af en figur udendørs: Kvinde med en parasol, vendt mod venstre, 1886<br/><br/>Claude Monet [Public domain eller Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>Formålet med denne artikel og hvordan man tackler udfordringen<br/><br/>Et par år tilbage skrev jeg en artikel kaldet "Poem Without an End", som omfattede et juledigt, jeg havde skrevet, der lånte sig til at blive tilføjet til. Jeg var forbløffet over svaret, da jeg på det tidspunkt kun havde et par tilhængere her. Folk skrev en strofe af poesi hver i "kommentarer" på navet for at følge op fra den foregående kommentators strofe. Det fungerede meget godt, og til sidst samlede jeg alle bidragene i et enkelt digt som en del af navet.<br/><br/>Lignende udfordringer er blevet udstedt siden, herunder en af Frank Atanacio kaldet "Spirits Sat as Mourners", der også var meget vellykket. Forskellen er, at i dette tilfælde bidragydere skrev deres egne knudepunkter for deres strofe af poesi og placeret et link på Frank oprindelige hub.<br/><br/>Til denne særlige udfordring forventer jeg ikke, at alle bruger værdifuld tid på at skrive separate hubs til en strofe poesi (medmindre du virkelig vil). Det største problem er, at for at gøre det effektivt du ville have til at kopiere de tidligere skrevne dele af digtet på din hub og ville sandsynligvis blive ramt med "duplikation" etiket.<br/><br/>Så det er tilfældet, og også for at spare at skulle forlade links overalt, beder jeg bare om, at alle, der ønsker at deltage, bare skriver deres stanza her i "kommentarer". Tjek den sidste kommentar før din, der bidrager til udfordringen og følg op. Hvis jeg ser mere end én følge fra samme strofe, vil jeg bruge min poetiske licens til at arbejde dem ind, som jeg finder bedst.<br/><br/>På et tidspunkt, hvor jeg føler, at der har været nok strofer tilføjet, vil jeg sandsynligvis kalde en ende på udfordringen og derefter kompilere dem alle sammen som det færdige digt som en del af artiklen (også give kredit til hver bidragyder).<br/><br/>Flowered Riverbank, Argenteuil<br/><br/>Claude Monet [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>Udfordringen!<br/><br/>Nu kommer den interessante del. Hvis du deltager i denne kæde poesi udfordring, du er nødt til at forsøge at holde stil og stemme af digtet så tæt som muligt på de foregående vers, så at uinformerede læsere vil det fremgå, at kun én forfatter har skrevet hele digtet.<br/><br/>Lyder nemt, siger du? Måske ville det være, hvis digtet havde en traditionel stil, rim eller meter. Men det gør den ikke! Digtet, du vil tilføje til, blev startet af en bekendt af min Andriealphus som en "kæde digt udfordring" andre steder. I skrivende stund var jeg den eneste anden person, der havde accepteret udfordringen, og fordi jeg elskede emnet, troede jeg, at det ville være en stor udfordring for mine medforfattere og besluttede at bruge det her og se, om svaret ville være bedre. (Jeg kender et par digtere her, hvis skrivning ville passe til denne stil)<br/><br/>Regler :<br/><br/>Følg op på den forrige strofe i kommentarerne<br/><br/>Prøv at bevare digtets stemme og stil<br/><br/>Hold din strofe/vers til nogenlunde samme længde som dem før<br/><br/>Claude Monet var en af de mest berømte malere i kunsthistorien og en ledende figur i den impressionistiske bevægelse.<br/><br/>I 1883 flyttede Monet til Giverny, hvor han elskede at male udendørs i de haver, han var med til at skabe. Vandliljerne fundet i dammen havde en særlig appel, og han malede flere serier af dem i resten af sit liv; den japanske stil bro over dammen blev genstand for flere værker, så godt.<br/><br/>I 1912 Monet malet en serie af 12 vandlily malerier bestilt af Orangerie des Tuileries, et museum i Paris. Han valgte at gøre dem i meget stor skala, og til at tjene som en "havn af fredelig meditation." Dette projekt forbruges meget af Monets senere år. Monet engang udtalt, "Disse landskaber af vand og refleksion er blevet en besættelse for mig. Det er ud over min styrke som en gammel mand, og alligevel vil jeg gøre, hvad jeg føler."<br/><br/>Hans helbred var nu også en hindring. Næsten blind, med begge hans øjne alvorligt påvirket af grå stær, Monet endelig enige om at gennemgå kirurgi for lidelsen i 1923.<br/><br/>Monets berømte vandliljer blev rødere, da hans grå stær skred frem. Efter at have fået korrigerende kirurgi ødelagde han de fleste af de "røde lilje" malerier, vred over, at ingen virkelig nævnte det for ham. Ironisk nok var disse malerier sandsynligvis det, der gjorde hans impressionistiske stil så berømt i den tid - kunstnere begyndte at tage flere risici med farve og sådan i løbet af dette punkt.<br/><br/>Mesterværket<br/><br/>"Drengen, der sidder bag dig, siger, at du ligner et mesterværk.<br/><br/>Spørg ham, har han nogensinde set en Monet på nært hold?<br/><br/>Tæt nok på til ikke at se andet end rodede streger af ukrudtsagtige søbredder?<br/><br/>Tæt nok til at dyppe fingrene i højderyggene<br/><br/>hvor oliemaling hærdet under en kunstners blik?<br/><br/>Tæt nok på til at trække vejret på blodliljerne?<br/><br/>Spørg ham, hvorfor han malede dem røde?" (Andriealphus)<br/><br/>Han grinede som Carrolls cheshirekat.<br/><br/>"Gennem skyede og blodskudte øjne forestiller jeg mig.<br/><br/>Vær mine vandliljer!" siger han,<br/><br/>"Føl min ånde og lad mine fingre dykke,<br/><br/>I stedet bliver det mit mesterværk.<br/><br/>En børste har aldrig rørt et lærred så fint som din lyse hud.<br/><br/>Lad herrerne græde i jalousi,<br/><br/>og van Gogh skærer sit øre i misundelse over skønheden i din nøgenhed.”<br/><br/>Selvportræt med bandageret øre<br/><br/>Vincent van Gogh [Offentlig ejendom], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>Besvarelser<br/><br/>Nu er det din tur.

Jeg ser virkelig frem til at tilføje til dette.<br/><br/>Først ville jeg stoppe og fortælle dig det, helt sikkert.<br/><br/>Og mange tak for alle udfordringerne med at hjælpe resten af os, holde vores mentale energi flydende og give det et arbejde! Du er den bedste.<br/><br/>Oplysningerne om LuLu og det gratis ISBN-nummer er en besvaret bøn! Så smil min ven. Du er en gave!<br/><br/>Knus. :-)<br/><br/>John Hansen (forfatter) fra Gondwana Land den 12. august 2015:<br/><br/>Hej igen Marj. Jeg tror, jeg kan have alle de vers, der kommer. Jeg har gjort mit bedste for at arrangere dem, som jeg synes bedst med bare en lille redigering. Jeg vil sandsynligvis sende det færdige digt som en separat hub med et link på denne ene til det. Min bog er tilgængelig på Lulu og iBooks... der er et link på en af de tidligere kommentarer. Jeg ville virkelig sætte pris på, hvis du skulle købe en kopi. Husk det er min første e-bog, så formateringen osv. er ikke perfekt, men det har taget mig syv revisioner, jeg tror at få det, hvor det er. Det bliver lettere næste gang. Hvis du har brug for hjælp, så lad mig det vide.<br/><br/>travmaj fra australien den 12. august 2015:<br/><br/>Hej John, du har helt sikkert haft nogle gode svar på din udfordring - jeg er sikker på, at du vil smelte det helt smukt, selvom jeg forestiller mig en vanskelig opgave. Jeg er også interesseret i dine digtbøger - jeg er virkelig nødt til at få mit nummer sammen teknologisk - jeg vil prøve at tjekke det hele ud ... cheers -<br/><br/>John Hansen (forfatter) fra Gondwana Land den 11. august 2015:<br/><br/>Hej Jo, begge bøger 'On the Wings of Eagles' og "I Laughed a Smile" har for det meste det samme indhold ... undtagen førstnævnte har et ekstra digt. Oprindeligt var de i forskellige formater, en ePub, den anden PDF, men nu er de begge ePub. De er tilgængelige via Lulu og iBooks, snart Barnes og Noble og Nook (ikke Amazon). Jeg kan prøve at udgive en anden bog via Amazon snart bare for at se, hvordan det sammenligner. Tak igen.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues fra Lincolnshire, Storbritannien den 11. august 2015:<br/><br/>John, mange tak, info om udgivelse med Lulu vil være ganske nyttigt, da jeg tænker på udgivelse, men jeg er i øjeblikket revet mellem Amazon og Lulu. Jeg ønskede at købe en af dine bøger, men jeg kunne ikke synes at finde dem på Amazon. Men jeg vil nok få det fra Lulu. Ønsker dig al succes, du fortjener det.<br/><br/>John Hansen (forfatter) fra Gondwana Land den 11. august 2015:<br/><br/>Hej Phyllis, tak for at give. Jeg kan godt lide det, en perfekt slutning på digtet, tror jeg.<br/><br/>John Hansen (forfatter) fra Gondwana Land den 11. august 2015:<br/><br/>Tak til Faith.<br/><br/>John Hansen (forfatter) fra Gondwana Land den 11. august 2015:<br/><br/>Hej Jo, jeg tror, jeg har sorteret digtet tilfredsstillende. Bare venter på at se, om der er mere at tilføje. Udgivelse med Lulu var ikke dårligt, og nu har jeg gjort det, når det bliver lettere næste gang. At få formateringen til at se rigtigt ud i e-bogen var det sværeste, selvom du og bare skriv det i et orddokument, og Lulu producerer automatisk indholdssiden og konverterer dokumentet til ePub eller PDF, du kan kun bruge visse skrifttyper og skal sørge for, at kapitelnavnene eller digttitlerne er i overskrift 1. De giver også et gratis ISBN-nummer, hvis du vil. Samlet set var det dog lettere end forventet.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues fra Lincolnshire, Storbritannien den 11. august 2015:<br/><br/>Phyllis, det er kortfattet og smukt, jeg elsker det. Shyron har også gjort et fremragende stykke arbejde, jeg troede, jeg allerede havde kommenteret hendes vers, men det havde jeg ikke.<br/><br/>Phyllis Doyle Burns fra High desert i Nevada. den 10. august 2015:<br/><br/>Vidunderlig hub, god idé, Jodah.

John, ser frem til at læse slutresultatet.<br/><br/>Af den måde, congtats på at udgive dine digte. Hvordan fandt du processen med at udgive med Lulu?<br/><br/>John Hansen (forfatter) fra Gondwana Land den 10. august 2015:<br/><br/>Tak for din store underkastelse Faith. Nej det er ikke for sent, jeg er stadig ved at udarbejde det endelige digt, så det burde være op til alle at se om en dag eller to.<br/><br/>Faith Reaper fra det sydlige USA den 10. august 2015:<br/><br/>Hej John,<br/><br/>Jeg undskylder for min sene indsendelse her til din vidunderlige udfordring. Jeg er væk fra arbejde et par dage og besluttede at give dette en go, mens min mand hviler fra knæoperation.

Tak til alle, der har bidraget.<br/><br/>John Hansen (forfatter) fra Gondwana Land den 2. august 2015:<br/><br/>Tak Genna. Det ser ud til Monet er en favorit arist af mange her. Jeg håber du vil deltage i denne udfordring også :)<br/><br/>John Hansen (forfatter) fra Gondwana Land den 2. august 2015:<br/><br/>Tak for et godt bidrag Shyron. Dette er et meget flot vers. Godt klaret.<br/><br/>Genna East fra Massachusetts, USA den 2. august 2015:<br/><br/>Hej John.<br/><br/>Jeg begyndte at læse denne vidunderlige udfordring (Monet er en af mine yndlingskunstnere), så kom tilbage for at læse nogle af de smukke bidrag, der giver dette maleri en fantastisk stemme gennem opfattelse og sanserne.

Jeg er så glad for, at du kan lide mit bidrag. Dette er en meget god idé, jeg ved, at du vil have det sjovt at sætte det hele sammen. Pas på og mit bedste til dig.<br/><br/>John Hansen (forfatter) fra Gondwana Land den 1. august 2015:<br/><br/>Tak Deb, ja jeg er imponeret over standarden af indsendelser. Jeg ser frem til at sætte det hele sammen.<br/><br/>John Hansen (forfatter) fra Gondwana Land den 1. august 2015:<br/><br/>Ja Ann, det er godt at se digterne blandt os tage udfordringen op med nogle store bidrag hidtil. Jeg håber bare, at jeg kan gøre det retfærdighed, når det kommer til at sætte det sammen.<br/><br/>John Hansen (forfatter) fra Gondwana Land den 1. august 2015:<br/><br/>Godt gået Jo. Ordet "sublime" kommer til at tænke. Jeg håbede, at alle digterne ville stige i forgrunden, og de har. Elsker det, tak for at bidrage.<br/><br/>Deb Hirt fra Stillwater, OK den 1. august 2015:<br/><br/>Jeg er spændt på at se, hvad du ender med her. Der er en række fine digtere stiger til udfordringen, så gå til det!<br/><br/>Ann Carr fra SW England den 1. august 2015:<br/><br/>Den er god, Jo!<br/><br/>Du har fået alle til at gå, John! Hellere dig end mig, at sætte alt dette sammen, men det kommer til at være en humdinger af et digt, når det endelig kommer til en ende - hvis det nogensinde gør! Du har virkelig startet noget.<br/><br/>Ann<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues fra Lincolnshire, Storbritannien den 1. august 2015:<br/><br/>John følger efter Kim, og jeg håber, det lyder godt.<br/><br/>Og drengen begyndte at gå<br/><br/>Men i hans kølvand hørte jeg ham sige:<br/><br/>"Jeg tog en tur til Orangerie<br/><br/>Hvor Monets spøgelse stadig opholder sig<br/><br/>Jeg satte mig ned og kiggede lidt<br/><br/>Indtil jeg hørte en blød stemme græde.<br/><br/>Har du nogensinde set en flydende drøm?<br/><br/>Hvor lyset udvikler sig til det, det rører ved<br/><br/>Hvor sindsro flyder gennem overskyet slør<br/><br/>Hvor tryllekunstnerens pensel som lynets hast<br/><br/>Har du nogensinde set et sublimt syn?<br/><br/>Et barn født af forvrænget illusion<br/><br/>Denne blomstrende dam, der fælder lyset<br/><br/>Det løfter hjertet og vinker til sjælen<br/><br/>en, abstrakt, pulchritude, rykke sammen<br/><br/>Gå tilbage, se; sådan en rolig glæde.

Mit bedste...<br/><br/>Jo.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues fra Lincolnshire, Storbritannien den 1. august 2015:<br/><br/>Okay!<br/><br/>John Hansen (forfatter) fra Gondwana Land den 1. august 2015:<br/><br/>Alle er velkomne til at lave mere end én strofe. Jeg kan tilføje en anden selv på et tidspunkt.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues fra Lincolnshire, Storbritannien den 1. august 2015:<br/><br/>John, jeg har besluttet at prøve, men det er omkring 16 linjer, kan jeg gøre det i to strofer efter Kims vidunderlige indsendelse? Du kan altid redigere det senere.<br/><br/>John Hansen (forfatter) fra Gondwana Land den 31. juli 2015:<br/><br/>Hej Jo, ked af at høre, at du er under vejret i øjeblikket. Jeg har ikke travlt med at lukke denne udfordring, så jeg holder den åben, indtil du er tilbage og skyder på alle cylindre og er i stand til at bidrage. Du er en af de hubbers jeg glædede mig til at få et svar fra, som jeg troede det ville passe. Tak for dine venlige ord, og få det godt snart.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues fra Lincolnshire, Storbritannien den 31. juli 2015:<br/><br/>Wow! John Jeg kan ikke tro, at jeg næsten savnede din utrolige udfordret. Dette er noget, som jeg ville have elsket at deltage i, da Claude Monet er en af mine all times favorit kunstner. Desværre må jeg græde. Jeg er lidt under vejret med et hoved fuld af bomuldsuld, eller sådan ser det ud. Hvis udfordringen stadig er åben, når jeg slippe af med denne irriterende influenza, kan jeg give det en chance, men jeg må sige, standarden er usædvanlig høj. Maj tog det til et andet niveau, men alle indsendelserne er strålende. Kudos til dig Andriealphus og de andre forfattere, der deltog hidtil i dette kunstneriske og kreative mesterværk.<br/><br/>Min bedste altid Jo.<br/><br/>John Hansen (forfatter) fra Gondwana Land den 31. juli 2015:<br/><br/>Hej igen Maj, glad for dette digt inspirerede dig, og ja det slår at se cricket især med Aussie batsmen udfører dårligt i denne tredje test. Det vil være en interessant øvelse for mig at smelte alle strofer sammen, men bør være god.<br/><br/>travmaj fra australien den 30. juli 2015:<br/><br/>John, tak, jeg er mest glad for, at du kan lide mit tilbud. Jeg fandt digtet spændende og følte mig pludselig inspireret til at skrive min version i samme tilstand. Jeg er ikke sikker på, at jeg skrev en fortsættelse fra stanza før (altid udforske), men jeg er sikker på, at du vil smelte det helt, når tiden kommer. Elsker alle svarene. Jeg har ikke formået nogen kreativ skrivning for yonks, kan ikke vente nu for at starte forfra, bare har brug for lidt tid. (beats ser cricket også!!!) Cheers John, vil tjekke ind -<br/><br/>John Hansen (forfatter) fra Gondwana Land den 30. juli 2015:<br/><br/>Tak for at tjekke Dana. Jeg er tilfreds med kvaliteten af svarene hidtil. Jeg må bare vente og se, hvor mange flere kommer ind. Den endelige, digt skal være stor.<br/><br/>Dana Tate fra LOS ANGELES den 30. juli 2015:<br/><br/>Bare tjekker ind for at se, hvordan tingene går, jeg kan ikke vente på det færdige produkt. Jeg deltog i en poesi klasse, og vi gjorde dette også det var virkelig sjovt.<br/><br/>ocfireflies fra North Carolina den 29. juli 2015:<br/><br/>John.<br/><br/>Tak så meget for at give platformen for uden at det er let at falde ned.<br/><br/>; ) Kim<br/><br/>John Hansen (forfatter) fra Gondwana Land den 29. juli 2015:<br/><br/>Tak, Devika. Jeg har ikke set dig i et stykke tid, jeg håber alt er godt.<br/><br/>John Hansen (forfatter) fra Gondwana Land den 29. juli 2015:<br/><br/>Smukt arbejde Kim. Det vil følge perfekt fra Majs, da du besvarede GIverny-spørgsmålet. Jeg er så tilfreds med kvaliteten af svarene hidtil.<br/><br/>ocfireflies fra North Carolina den 29. juli 2015:<br/><br/>John.<br/><br/>Jeg havde sendt dette tidligere før travmaj's awesome bidrag, men måske virker det stadig (jeg gjorde lidt tweaking)<br/><br/>i modsætning til tidligere - ved ikke, om<br/><br/>Jeg giver nogen mening. Hvis det ikke virker, er du velkommen til at slette, og jeg vil prøve igen. |

| First of all EEQT itself needs to be further developed in order to provide a theoretical and computational answer to the needs of modern quantum engineering<br/>and technology. We need to include classical systems with infinite<br/>numbers of degrees of freedom - like electromagnetic and/or gravitational<br/>field. We also need to include infinite quantum systems so as<br/>to understand and simulate Bose gas and its phase transitions. But, there<br/>are also steps that must be taken far beyond the paradigm of EEQT.<br/>As we have emphasized so many times: quantum theory has yet<br/>to be understood in terms of a "non-linear classical theory." But what we mean by a "classical theory" is something much more advanced and more<br/>general than clasical mechanics or classical field theory. By a "classical theory" we mean first of all, a theory that is not based<br/>on probabilities from the start; a theory in which probabilities appear at a<br/>later stage, derived from the theory; derived perhaps, in a necessary way. Such a theory must not only specify the mathematical objects and their relations but also make "predictions".<br/>A classical theory is, in particular, a theory in which discrete events can happen, events that are "objective." They may be events that affect mainly the physical stratum, but they may be also "mental<br/>events," changes of states of "consciousness;" whatever they are, even if they<br/>are concerned with branchings of universes, - they DO HAPPEN.<br/>Such a theory, encompassing the quantum theory as we know it today,<br/>does not yet exist, but we can envisage its possible shape. Nothing serves better than an example, so let us give here an example of how<br/>such a theory can be construed.<br/>Imagine a theory developed a'la Einstein's unified field theory, but<br/>with variable metric signature, possibly with a complex causal web, multiple<br/>Einstein-Rosen [40] (see also [41]) bridges,<br/>time loops, nondifferrentiability, fractal structure, all of that additionally complicated by variable dimensionality of space and of "time" (cf [42]. Imagine such a theory to be able to accomodate all the four fundamental<br/>forces known to us, but it also involves an extra field, which is different<br/>from physical fields, and which is non-local in the sense that it does not<br/>survive taking a macro-average-limit when causal space-time<br/>structure of Einstein's general relativity is recovered. This extra field<br/>would be a place for "thought forms" and our theory would couple these<br/>thought forms to more "physical" levels of reality. The very concept of<br/>"time" would arise only in one particular limiting structure. Nothing<br/>prevents a theory of such a type to have mathematical structures rich enough to accomodate consciousness and mind. Due to its complexity,<br/>density of time-loops, bubble-like causal structure, making predictions<br/>in such theory is possible only by applying probability -<br/>as it is the case with systems evolving according to deterministic<br/>but chaotic dynamics. Quantum wave function would emerge in such a<br/>theory as an effective way of predicting. That type of explanation<br/>of quantum indeterminism was postulated long ago by I. J. Good. In<br/>[3] he speculated that<br/>quantum indeterminism can be understood if we admit that individual quantum events that actually happen here and now have future<br/>advanced causes as well has past retarded causes.<br/>A glimpse of such a thought<br/>may have occured to Alan Turing when he wrote his famous, already quoted sentence: "prediction must be linear, description must be nonlinear."<br/>A theory going partially in this direction is being developed by L. Nottale<br/>[43] who states the observation, attributed to Feynman, that "the typical paths of quantum mechanical particles are continuous non-differentiable." Then he continues his development of fractal<br/>space-time ideas to conclude with: "The quantum behavior becomes, in this theory,<br/>a manifestation of the fractal geometry of space-time, in the same way gravitation is, in Einstein's theory of general (motion-)relativity, a manifestation of the curvature of space-time.<br/>Another step in this direction comes from the work of Russian scientists - which started with the most original ideas of N.A. Kozyrev [44]<br/>and A. Sakharov [45], and is being developed in Moscow, the Urals and Siberia, see e.g. [46, 47, 48]. | Først og fremmest EEQT selv skal videreudvikles for at give en teoretisk og beregningsmæssige svar på behovene i moderne kvanteteknik og teknologi. Vi er nødt til at inkludere klassiske systemer med uendeligt antal frihedsgrader - som elektromagnetisk og / eller tyngdefelt. Vi er også nødt til at inkludere uendelige kvantesystemer for at forstå og simulere Bose gas og dens faseovergange. Men der er også skridt, der skal tages langt ud over EEQTs paradigme.<br/>Som vi har understreget så mange gange: kvanteteori er endnu ikke forstået i form af en "ikke-lineær klassisk teori." Men hvad vi mener med en "klassisk teori" er noget meget mere avanceret og mere generelt end klasisk mekanik eller klassisk feltteori. Med en "klassisk teori" mener vi først og fremmest en teori, der ikke er baseret på sandsynligheder fra starten; en teori, hvor sandsynligheder vises på et senere tidspunkt, afledt af teorien; afledt måske på en nødvendig måde. En sådan teori skal ikke kun angive de matematiske objekter og deres relationer, men også gøre "forudsigelser".<br/>En klassisk teori er især en teori, hvor diskrete begivenheder kan ske, begivenheder, der er "objektive". De kan være begivenheder, der hovedsageligt påvirker det fysiske lag, men de kan også være "mentale begivenheder," ændringer af tilstande af "bevidsthed;" uanset hvad de er, selv hvis de beskæftiger sig med forgreninger af universer, - de sker.<br/>En sådan teori, der omfatter kvanteteorien, som vi kender den i dag, eksisterer endnu ikke, men vi kan forestille os dens mulige form. Intet tjener bedre end et eksempel, så lad os her give et eksempel på, hvordan en sådan teori kan fortolkes.<br/>Forestil dig en teori udviklet a'la Einsteins unified field teori, men med variabel metrisk signatur, muligvis med en kompleks kausal web, flere<br/>Einstein-Rosen [40] (se også [41]) broer, tidssløjfer, ikke-forskellige, fraktal struktur, alt dette yderligere kompliceret af variabel dimensionalitet af rum og "tid" (jf [42]. Forestil dig en sådan teori for at være i stand til at rumme alle de fire grundlæggende kræfter, der er kendt for os, men det indebærer også et ekstra felt, som er forskelligt fra fysiske felter, og som er ikke-lokalt i den forstand, at det ikke overlever at tage en makro-gennemsnitlig grænse, når kausal rum-tidsstruktur af Einsteins generelle relativitetsteori er genoprettet. Dette ekstra felt ville være et sted for "tankeformer", og vores teori ville koble disse tankeformer til mere "fysiske" virkelighedsniveauer.<br/>"tid" ville kun opstå i en bestemt begrænsende struktur. Intet forhindrer en teori af en sådan type at have matematiske strukturer rige nok til at rumme bevidsthed og sind. På grund af sin kompleksitet, tæthed af tids-loops, boble-lignende kausal struktur, gør forudsigelser i en sådan teori er kun mulig ved at anvende sandsynlighed -<br/>som det er tilfældet med systemer, der udvikler sig i henhold til deterministisk, men kaotisk dynamik. Kvantebølgefunktion ville opstå i en sådan teori som en effektiv måde at forudsige. Den type forklaring af kvante indeterminisme blev postuleret for længe siden af I. J. Good. I<br/>Han spekulerede på, at kvante indeterminisme kan forstås, hvis vi indrømmer, at individuelle kvante begivenheder, der faktisk sker her og nu har fremtidige avancerede årsager samt har tidligere retarderede årsager.<br/>Et glimt af en sådan tanke kan være opstået for Alan Turing, da han skrev sin berømte, allerede citerede sætning: "forudsigelse skal være lineær, beskrivelse skal være ikke-lineær."<br/>En teori, der går delvist i denne retning er ved at blive udviklet af L. Nottale<br/>[43] som anfører observationen, tilskrevet Feynman, at "de typiske stier af kvantemekaniske partikler er kontinuerlige ikke-differentierbare." Derefter fortsætter han sin udvikling af fraktale rum-tid-ideer til at slutte med: "Kvanteadfærden bliver i denne teori en manifestation af rum-tidens fraktale geometri, på samme måde er tyngdekraften i Einsteins teori om generel (bevægelses-)relativitet, en manifestation af rum-tidens krumning.<br/>Et andet skridt i denne retning kommer fra russiske forskeres arbejde - som startede med de mest originale ideer fra N.A. Kozyrev [44]<br/>og A. Sakharov [45], og udvikles i Moskva, Uralerne og Sibirien, se f. Eks. [46, 47, 48]. |
| Best Nutrition And Exercise For Lose Weight<br/><br/>How is breakfast really healthy?<br/><br/>In the morning like an emperor, at noon like a king, in the evening like a beggar – goes a well-known proverb. A study by the medical organization Endocrine Society confirms the key message behind the saying: It shows that breakfast plays a more important role than is often assumed. In the morning, the human body actually has more than twice as high a metabolic activity as at other times of the day: A large breakfast not only keeps you full for a long time, blood sugar and insulin levels also rise slowly. The appetite for sweets is regulated, we eat snacks less often during the day. Therefore, breakfast should not be skipped even during a diet.<br/><br/>Of course, having a big breakfast doesn't mean that we should have several croissants with nut nougat cream and sweet breakfast pancakes in the morning. Breakfast is healthy best when it is high in protein and fiber, as well as providing vitamins and minerals. Whole grain bread or muesli, oat flakes, fruits and nuts are energy suppliers that are good for you and keep you full for a long time.<br/><br/>The fact that a large breakfast is better than a large dinner does not necessarily mean that breakfast is essential for losing weight. A meta-analysis carried out in 2019 showed, that the total daily energy intake of people who eat breakfast is on average higher, than that of those who do not have breakfast. The latter were on average just under half a kilo lighter. So, according to the results of this major study, you don't necessarily have to eat breakfast if you want to lose weight.<br/><br/>Lose weight with the right diet – that's how easy it is to put healthy on your plate<br/><br/>Eating healthy in no way means less taste. Fresh vegetables, fish or meat as protein sources and other healthy ingredients conjure up taste in the pot and a smile on your lips – ideally also when you step on the scales. A US study has shown that people who cook their own food and consciously deal with what they eat have a body mass index in the normal range. Restaurant visits or fast food, on the other hand, quickly lure you into the sugar trap: Often there is no indication of how much sugar is in salad dressings, how much fat the potatoes were fried in or whether the meat was not treated.<br/><br/>A healthy lunch consists of three parts – the largest part is fruits or vegetables and should cover half of the plate. A quarter of the meal should consist of protein, i.e. fish, meat or tofu. The remaining quarter consists of carbohydrates and is ideally made from whole grain products. Important: Don't eat at your desk in the office, but stimulate your metabolism and ideally take a short walk before or after lunch.<br/><br/>When should you eat to lose weight?<br/><br/>In the evening, you should focus on light meals that are rather low in carbohydrates. These are the least likely to cause insulin to skyrocket, which is good for our body. Vegetables, dairy products and nuts, for example, are well suited for this.<br/><br/>You should also be careful not to have dinner too late. It is best to have eaten until 7 p.m. – then the body can relax and prepare for the night. Sufficient sleep is important for healthy weight loss. A US study found that people who slept about eight hours a night had better fat deposits. So good night! Allow yourself more than six hours of sleep so that you can start the next day fit and refreshed.<br/><br/>Losing weight without exercise – is it really possible?<br/><br/>It would be so easy, if the dream weight could be achieved simply by lowering the calorie intake. But you probably know the wisdom that diet is only one side of the coin and exercise is the other. So nothing helps: Put on your sportswear and off you go!<br/><br/>Anyone who, in addition to the sports program such as jogging, walking or swimming, also lets the elevator go alone and takes the stairs, takes a little detour or uses the bike instead of the car, is doing wellis also called something good. Even simple walking is good for health. | Bedste Ernæring Og Motion For Tabe Vægt<br/><br/>Hvordan er morgenmad sundt?<br/><br/>Om morgenen som en kejser, ved middagstid som en konge, om aftenen som en tigger – lyder et velkendt ordsprog. En undersøgelse foretaget af den medicinske organisation Endocrine Society bekræfter hovedbudskabet bag ordsproget: Det viser, at morgenmad spiller en vigtigere rolle, end det ofte antages. Om morgenen har den menneskelige krop faktisk mere end dobbelt så høj metabolisk aktivitet som på andre tidspunkter af dagen: En stor morgenmad holder dig ikke kun fuld i lang tid, blodsukkeret og insulinniveauet stiger også langsomt. Appetitten for slik er reguleret, vi spiser snacks mindre ofte i løbet af dagen. Derfor bør morgenmad ikke springes over, selv under en kost.<br/><br/>Selvfølgelig, at have en stor morgenmad betyder ikke, at vi skal have flere croissanter med nødde nougat fløde og søde morgenmad pandekager om morgenen. Morgenmad er sundt bedst, når det er højt i protein og fiber, samt at give vitaminer og mineraler. Fuldkornsbrød eller muesli, havreflager, frugt og nødder er energileverandører, der er gode for dig og holder dig fuld i lang tid.<br/><br/>Det faktum, at en stor morgenmad er bedre end en stor middag betyder ikke nødvendigvis, at morgenmad er afgørende for at tabe sig. En meta-analyse udført i 2019 viste, at det samlede daglige energiindtag hos mennesker, der spiser morgenmad, er i gennemsnit højere end hos dem, der ikke spiser morgenmad. Sidstnævnte var i gennemsnit lige under en halv kilo lettere. Så ifølge resultaterne af denne store undersøgelse behøver du ikke nødvendigvis at spise morgenmad, hvis du vil tabe dig.<br/><br/>Gå ned i vægt med den rigtige kost - det er så nemt det er at sætte sundt på din tallerken<br/><br/>At spise sundt betyder på ingen måde mindre smag. Friske grøntsager, fisk eller kød som proteinkilder og andre sunde ingredienser fremtryller smag i gryden og et smil på læberne – ideelt også når du træder på vægten. En amerikansk undersøgelse har vist, at folk, der laver deres egen mad og bevidst beskæftiger sig med, hvad de spiser, har et body mass index i det normale område. Restaurantbesøg eller fastfood lokker dig derimod hurtigt i sukkerfælden: Ofte er der ingen indikation af, hvor meget sukker der er i salatdressinger, hvor meget fedt kartoflerne blev stegt i, eller om kødet ikke blev behandlet.<br/><br/>En sund frokost består af tre dele - den største del er frugt eller grøntsager og skal dække halvdelen af pladen. En fjerdedel af måltidet skal bestå af protein, dvs. fisk, kød eller tofu. Det resterende kvartal består af kulhydrater og er ideelt lavet af fuldkornsprodukter. Vigtigt: Spis ikke ved dit skrivebord på kontoret, men stimulere dit stofskifte og ideelt tage en kort gåtur før eller efter frokost.<br/><br/>Hvornår skal man spise for at tabe sig?<br/><br/>Om aftenen bør du fokusere på lette måltider, der er ret lave i kulhydrater. Disse er de mindst tilbøjelige til at forårsage insulin til skyrocket, hvilket er godt for vores krop. Grøntsager, mejeriprodukter og nødder er for eksempel velegnede til dette.<br/><br/>Du bør også være forsigtig med ikke at have middag for sent. Det er bedst at have spist indtil 7 pm - så kroppen kan slappe af og forberede sig på natten. Tilstrækkelig søvn er vigtig for et sundt vægttab. En amerikansk undersøgelse viste, at folk, der sov omkring otte timer om natten, havde bedre fedtdepoter. Så godnat! Tillad dig selv mere end seks timers søvn, så du kan starte den næste dag, der passer og opdateres.<br/><br/>At tabe sig uden motion – er det virkelig muligt?<br/><br/>Det ville være så nemt, hvis drømmen vægt kunne opnås blot ved at sænke kalorieindtag. Men du sikkert kender visdom, at kost er kun den ene side af mønten og motion er den anden. Så intet hjælper: Tag på din sportstøj og off du går!<br/><br/>Enhver, der, ud over sport program såsom jogging, gå eller svømning, også lader elevatoren gå alene og tager trappen, tager en lille omvej eller bruger cyklen i stedet for bilen, gør wellis også kaldes noget godt. Selv enkle gåture er godt for helbredet. |
| Why We Open Sourced the Anvil App Server<br/><br/>Why Open Source?<br/><br/>A little while ago, we open-sourced the Anvil App Server. The community reaction has been great, even a little overwhelming (yes, every reply to that announcement really did land in my inbox!). We've already incorporated a bunch of that feedback into our version 1.2 release. But we keep getting asked, " Why did you open-source such a core part of your product? "<br/><br/>Why do this at all?<br/><br/>Anvil is a tool that makes it as simple as possible to build a web app. We do that by enabling you to build the whole application in one language, Python.<br/><br/>Simple hosting is part of that.<br/><br/>The web platform is broken , and Anvil is our attempt to fix it. And, because there is so much complexity in deploying a web app, a cloud-hosted service was the best way to provide the simplicity we want. That way, you can build your app in the Anvil Editor, and make it live on the Internet with one click.<br/><br/>But we kept hearing from people who said, "that's great, but…"<br/><br/>"…but I need to run this on an offshore platform without reliable internet access"<br/><br/>"…but I want to package my app into an IoT device I sell"<br/><br/>or simply, "…but if I'm putting my eggs in this basket, how can I be sure I can still run my app in ten years' time?"<br/><br/>These are all good points! A cloud service isn't the right solution for everyone. If we want to serve these users, there's got to be some way for them to get their apps out of Anvil and run them locally, under their own complete control.<br/><br/>Open Source: Escape hatch, not an ejector seat<br/><br/>We believe in escape hatches, not ejector seats. At conferences, we sometimes get asked, "can I export this as a Flask+JS app?". Sure, it would be possible – we could generate a server package, compile the client-side Python to Javascript, and spit out a classic web app. But it would have serious drawbacks, because:<br/><br/>Not a comfy ride.<br/><br/>Code generation is an ejector seat. Generated code is better than nothing – at least you can edit it! But the moment you edit that code, you lose all the benefits of the system that generated it. If you're using Anvil because of its drag-and-drop editor and Python in the browser, why should our locally-hosted users have to use vim and Javascript?<br/><br/>So we did it the right way: we open-sourced Anvil's runtime engine. It's the same code that serves your app in our hosted service, and it represents your app the same way. You can edit your code with a text editor, run it, then git push it back into our online IDE. It's not an ejector seat: there's no explosive transition. It's an escape hatch: you can climb out, and climb right back in.<br/><br/>What about our business model?<br/><br/>Anvil was never meant to be one of those enterprise low-code systems that charge you $20/mo for each person who uses your app. Anvil is a developer tool. The apps you develop are yours. Enabling you to run them on a Raspberry Pi is cool, but it doesn't change our business model.<br/><br/>We're doing what we always were: We make and sell a development tool that makes it drastically simpler to build web applications. We provide hosting for Anvil apps. We offer the entire development-and-hosting platform on-site for enterprise customers. And, of course, we offer a free plan so that everyone can use Anvil for hobby or educational purposes – or to start building something and see how it goes.<br/><br/>We've open-sourced the Anvil App Server for the (relatively small) number of people who need it, and to provide the ultimate insurance policy. Sure, you can build an app with vim and host it yourself, without even registering an account with us (we've got docs to show you how!). But the Anvil Editor is the world's easiest way to build a web app, and our hosted service is the easiest way to deploy it – so that's what we expect most of our users to continue doing. And you can build with confidence, knowing that the open-source code is right there if you need it.<br/><br/>Try it yourself<br/><br/>If our development philosophy resonates with you, why not try Anvil yourself? | Hvorfor vi åbner Anvil App Server<br/><br/>Hvorfor open source?<br/><br/>For lidt siden open sourcede vi Anvil App Server. Samfundets reaktion har været stor, endda lidt overvældende (ja, hvert svar på den meddelelse landede virkelig i min indbakke!). Vi har allerede indarbejdet en masse af denne feedback i vores version 1.2 udgivelse. Men vi bliver ved med at blive spurgt, "Hvorfor har du open source sådan en kernedel af dit produkt?"<br/><br/>Hvorfor overhovedet gøre det?<br/><br/>Anvil er et værktøj, der gør det så enkelt som muligt at bygge en webapp. Det gør vi ved at gøre det muligt for dig at bygge hele applikationen på ét sprog, Python.<br/><br/>Enkel hosting er en del af det.<br/><br/>Webplatformen er brudt, og Anvil er vores forsøg på at løse det. Og fordi der er så meget kompleksitet i at implementere en webapp, var en cloud-hostet tjeneste den bedste måde at give den enkelhed, vi ønsker. På den måde kan du bygge din app i Anvil Editor og gøre det live på internettet med et enkelt klik.<br/><br/>Men vi blev ved med at høre fra folk, der sagde: "Det er godt, men..."<br/><br/>"... men jeg er nødt til at køre dette på en offshore platform uden pålidelig internetadgang"<br/><br/>"...men jeg vil pakke min app ind i en IoT-enhed, jeg sælger"<br/><br/>eller simpelthen, "... men hvis jeg lægger mine æg i denne kurv, hvordan kan jeg være sikker på, at jeg stadig kan køre min app om ti år?"<br/><br/>Disse er alle gode punkter! En cloud-tjeneste er ikke den rigtige løsning for alle. Hvis vi ønsker at betjene disse brugere, er der nødt til at være en måde for dem at få deres apps ud af Anvil og køre dem lokalt, under deres egen fuldstændige kontrol.<br/><br/>Open Source: Escape luge, ikke en ejektor sæde<br/><br/>Vi tror på flugtluger, ikke ejektorsæder. På konferencer bliver vi nogle gange spurgt, "kan jeg eksportere dette som en Flask + JS app?". Sikker på, det ville være muligt - vi kunne generere en serverpakke, kompilere klientsiden Python til Javascript og spytte ud en klassisk webapp. Men det ville have alvorlige ulemper, fordi:<br/><br/>Ikke en behagelig tur.<br/><br/>Kodegenerering er et ejektorsæde. Genereret kode er bedre end ingenting - i det mindste kan du redigere det! Men det øjeblik du redigerer den kode, mister du alle fordelene ved det system, der genererede det. Hvis du bruger Anvil på grund af dens træk-og-slip-editor og Python i browseren, hvorfor skal vores lokalt hostede brugere bruge vim og Javascript?<br/><br/>Så vi gjorde det på den rigtige måde: Vi open sourcede Anvils runtime-motor. Det er den samme kode, der tjener din app i vores hostede tjeneste, og den repræsenterer din app på samme måde. Du kan redigere din kode med en teksteditor, køre den og derefter git skubbe den tilbage til vores online IDE. Det er ikke en ejektor sæde: der er ingen eksplosiv overgang. Det er en flugt luge: du kan klatre ud, og klatre lige tilbage i.<br/><br/>Hvad med vores forretningsmodel?<br/><br/>Anvil var aldrig beregnet til at være en af de enterprise low-code systemer, der opkræver dig $ 20 / mo for hver person, der bruger din app. Anvil er et udviklerværktøj. De apps, du udvikler, er dine. At gøre det muligt for dig at køre dem på en Raspberry Pi er cool, men det ændrer ikke vores forretningsmodel.<br/><br/>Vi gør, hvad vi altid har været: Vi laver og sælger et udviklingsværktøj, der gør det drastisk enklere at bygge webapplikationer. Vi leverer hosting til Anvil apps. Vi tilbyder hele udviklings- og hostingplatformen på stedet til virksomhedskunder. Og selvfølgelig tilbyder vi en gratis plan, så alle kan bruge Anvil til hobby eller uddannelsesmæssige formål - eller for at begynde at bygge noget og se, hvordan det går.<br/><br/>Vi har open sourcet Anvil App Server til det (relativt lille) antal mennesker, der har brug for det, og for at give den ultimative forsikring. Sikker på, du kan bygge en app med vim og være vært for det selv uden at registrere en konto hos os (vi har docs til at vise dig hvordan!). Men Anvil Editor er verdens nemmeste måde at bygge en webapp på, og vores hostede tjeneste er den nemmeste måde at implementere den på – så det er det, vi forventer, at de fleste af vores brugere fortsætter med at gøre. Og du kan bygge med tillid, vel vidende, at open source-koden er lige der, hvis du har brug for det.<br/><br/>Prøv det selv<br/><br/>Hvis vores udviklingsfilosofi giver genlyd hos dig, hvorfor så ikke prøve Anvil selv? |
