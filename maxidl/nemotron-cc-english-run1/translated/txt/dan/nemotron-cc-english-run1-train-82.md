In simple terms, the condition is characterized by: one develops a kidney disease and undergoes a kidney transplant and other diseases associated with acidic concentration in the blood and gout. In theory, the condition will occur even if the genetic change is inherited from one parent and sporadically occurs when there is no family history.<br/><br/>Common names of autosomal dominant interstitial kidney disease<br/><br/>The condition has other names as well namely: medullary cystic kidney disease, although this name is not used as much because most people suffering from this condition do not have medullary cysts. It is also referred to as juvenile hyperuricemic nephropathy. The disease tends to affect people of ages 20 to 50. The latter condition as aforementioned occurs in young children, something, which translate to get it from both parents.<br/>Cystic kidney disease is an inherited condition whereby the cysts in the centre of each kidney gradually lose their ability to function properly. Cysts refer to abnormal blisters of fluid in the kidney. The condition further scares the kidney making unable to concentrate the urine and as a result, producing too much urine. Its symptoms include excessive urination, salt cravings, weakness, confusion, bleeding, fatigue, frequent hiccups, low blood pressure, nausea and vomiting, headaches, pale skin, reduced sensation in the hands, weight loss among many others. Other complications include: anemia, ulcers, loss of bone density, infertility and other heart related problems.<br/>Its analysis incorporates blood tests to check for sodium levels and general kidney functions, urine tests to check the levels of concentration and other imbalances, x rays to check for the size of kidneys that may be altered owing to increased urine concentrations, renal biopsy and genetic testing to verify any genetic changes that might have taken place in due time.<br/>While the disease does not have a cut and dry treatment to it, one may focus on controlling measures, which include intake of fluids and salt to supplement the one lost as the disease progresses into latter stages. This also helps reduce dehydration. Other treatments include taking of prescribed medication and diet changes and minimal intakes of foods containing phosphorous and potassium. Further complications may also require one to have a kidney transplant. Basically, this is not a curable disease but rather a manageable once detected in the early stages.<br/><br/>The common yet different factor of Autosomal dominant interstitial kidney disease<br/><br/>Nephronophthisis and medullary cystic kidney disease are mainly grouped together because, in essence, they share the same features but with a slight difference in regards inheritance patterns to the former affecting children and the latter affecting young adults and older age groups. Similar features for both are ADH resistant urine concentration that leads to polyuria and polydipsia, anemia and renal diseases.<br/>The former aforementioned condition is Autosomal recessive accounting to 15% of chronic diseases and causes ESRD during early childhood while the latter is Autosomal dominant with a few sporadic new mutations and causes ESRD for people between the ages of 30 and 50. | Online CPR-certificeringsblog<br/><br/>Dato: 23. juli 2014<br/><br/>Autosomal dominant interstitiel nyresygdom er en sjælden samling af sygdomme, der påvirker de kendte funktioner i nyrerne. I enkle vendinger er tilstanden karakteriseret ved: man udvikler en nyresygdom og gennemgår en nyretransplantation og andre sygdomme forbundet med sur koncentration i blodet og gigt. I teorien vil tilstanden forekomme, selvom den genetiske ændring er arvet fra en forælder og sporadisk opstår, når der ikke er nogen familiehistorie.<br/><br/>Almindelige navne på autosomal dominant interstitiel nyresygdom<br/><br/>Tilstanden har også andre navne, nemlig: medullær cystisk nyresygdom, selvom dette navn ikke bruges så meget, fordi de fleste mennesker, der lider af denne tilstand, ikke har medullære cyster. Det er også omtalt som juvenil hyperuricemic nefropati. Sygdommen har tendens til at påvirke mennesker i alderen 20 til 50. Sidstnævnte tilstand som førnævnte forekommer hos små børn, noget, som oversætter for at få det fra begge forældre.<br/>Cystisk nyresygdom er en arvelig tilstand, hvorved cysterne i midten af hver nyre gradvist mister deres evne til at fungere korrekt. Cyster henviser til unormale blærer af væske i nyrerne. Tilstanden yderligere skræmmer nyrerne gør ude af stand til at koncentrere urinen og som følge heraf producerer for meget urin. Dens symptomer omfatter overdreven vandladning, salt cravings, svaghed, forvirring, blødning, træthed, hyppige hikke, lavt blodtryk, kvalme og opkastning, hovedpine, bleg hud, reduceret fornemmelse i hænderne, vægttab blandt mange andre. Andre komplikationer omfatter: anæmi, sår, tab af knogletæthed, infertilitet og andre hjerterelaterede problemer.<br/>Dens analyse omfatter blodprøver for at kontrollere for natriumniveauer og generelle nyrefunktioner, urinprøver for at kontrollere koncentrationsniveauer og andre ubalancer, røntgenstråler for at kontrollere for størrelsen af nyrer, der kan ændres på grund af øgede urinkoncentrationer, nyrebiopsi og genetisk test for at verificere eventuelle genetiske ændringer, der måtte have fundet sted i tide.<br/>Mens sygdommen ikke har en snit og tør behandling til det, kan man fokusere på at kontrollere foranstaltninger, som omfatter indtag af væsker og salt til at supplere den tabte som sygdommen skrider ind i sidstnævnte stadier. Dette hjælper også med at reducere dehydrering. Andre behandlinger omfatter indtagelse af ordineret medicin og kost ændringer og minimale indtag af fødevarer, der indeholder fosfor og kalium. Yderligere komplikationer kan også kræve en at have en nyretransplantation. Dybest set er dette ikke en helbredes sygdom, men snarere en håndterbar engang opdaget i de tidlige stadier.<br/><br/>Den fælles endnu forskellige faktor af Autosomal dominant interstitiel nyresygdom<br/><br/>Nephronophthisis og medullær cystisk nyresygdom er hovedsagelig grupperet sammen, fordi de i det væsentlige deler de samme træk, men med en lille forskel med hensyn til arvemønstre til førstnævnte påvirker børn og sidstnævnte påvirker unge voksne og ældre aldersgrupper. Lignende funktioner for begge er ADH-resistent urinkoncentration, der fører til polyuri og polydipsi, anæmi og nyresygdomme.<br/>Den førstnævnte tilstand er Autosomal recessiv regnskab til 15% af kroniske sygdomme og forårsager ESRD i den tidlige barndom, mens sidstnævnte er Autosomal dominerende med et par sporadiske nye mutationer og forårsager ESRD for mennesker mellem 30 og 50 år. |
| Hobbes' vs. Locke's Account on the State of Nature<br/><br/>Topic: PhilosophyWords: 2539Pages: 9Aug 3rd, 2021<br/><br/>Hobbes and Locke are among the most influential political philosophers to ever write in English. The state of nature, which precedes the organization of the complex societies, is the common premise that both Hobbes and Locke share but interpret in different ways. The former views humans in their natural state as equally dangerous and free to pursue their egoistic goals unrestricted by the nonexistent notions of justice, which is why his natural state amounts to the "war of every man against every man" (Hobbes76). The latter, on the other hand, views humans in their original condition as equally valuable and restricts natural freedom by the idea of justice that requires not to harm others, which allows defining the state of nature as "mutual assistance and preservation" rather than war (Locke 15). The key difference between the two philosophers' accounts of natural state is that Locke uses ethical considerations while Hobbes does not, and it ultimately leads Hobbes to envisage a state exercising unlimited power over human beings, while Locke limits the government by the moral principles, which he considers a natural law.<br/><br/>Hobbes bases his assumptions regarding the state of nature on the fact that all people are roughly equal in their physical and mental capabilities. He admits that some individuals may demonstrate greater physical strength or superior intellect but insists that "when all is reckoned together, the difference between man and man is not so considerable" (Hobbes 74). Since humans are roughly equal in their capabilities, they also have similar hopes to attain their ends and satisfy their needs (Hobbes 75). As a logical outcome of this equality, when the people begin competing for scarce resources, no one may feel entirely secure in his or her possessions. Even if a mighty, cunning, and capable person succeeds in subjugating "the persons of all men he can," it still does not guarantee the ultimate security (Hobbes 75). As no human can obtain such superiority over the others that renders him or her utterly immune to their strength of intellect, no human can feel completely safe when surrounded by his or her equals. Hobbes' equality in the natural state is equality of fear, where all humans view each other as dangerous competitors.<br/><br/>Just as Hobbes, Locke considers all human beings to be fundamentally equal, but assigns a very different meaning to the term. From his perspective, it is not the equality of capabilities, but, rather, the equality of value. He opines that the people "promiscuously born to all the same advantages of nature" should logically enjoy the perfect equality among them, as there is no reason to consider anyone inherently more valuable (Locke 8). The only possible foundation for designating some people as superior to others would be if God "by any manifest declaration of his will, set one above another" (Locke 8). Since such divine sanction of superiority is absent, Locke concludes that the natural equality of all representatives of humankind is not to be called into question. Hobbes approaches equality pragmatically and stresses that people in their natural state are equally dangerous, but Locke employs an ethical approach and emphasizes that humans are equally valuable in God's eyes. This disagreement is but the first difference between the two authors based on the fact that Locke includes God as a premise into his political philosophy, while Hobbes does not.<br/><br/>Another characteristic feature of Hobbes' account of the natural state is his interpretation of liberty. According to Hobbes, the state of nature implies unlimited freedom to do whatever is necessary for one's continued existence. The philosopher defines liberty as "the absence of external impediments" in using one's abilities to attain one's goals (Hobbes 79). The primary purpose of every sentient being is to maintain its continued existence. As a consequence, Hobbesian freedom amounts to the unhindered opportunity to do anything that, in one's judgment, would be best suited to preserve one's life and possessions (Hobbes 79). The only limitation to liberty is that a person cannot do anything contradictory to sustaining his or her life or destroying "the means of preserving the same" (Hobbes 79). Apart from that, there are no boundaries, and everyone has "a right to everything, even to one another's body" if that furthers one's survival (Hobbes 80). Thus, natural liberty, as viewed by Hobbes, is the absence of externally enforced obstacles in pursuing one's right to everything to sustain and secure one's continued existence.<br/><br/>Locke also upholds the idea of natural liberty but, unsurprisingly, approaches it in a manner that is significantly different from that of Hobbes. As soon as he begins discussing liberty in the state of nature, he immediately notes that a state of freedom does not equate "a state of license" (Locke 9). The philosopher identifies two specific limitations to human freedom in the state of nature. The first one is identical to that introduce by Hobbes: however free and independent, a person nevertheless "has not liberty to destroy himself" (Locke 9). Yet the second limitation contradicts Hobbes' prepositions directly. According to Locke, every human being has a natural obligation not to "harm another in his life, health, liberty, or possessions" (9). Just as with his interpretation of equality, the author bases this assertion on ethical and religious grounds: people should preserve each other's existence since they are all creations of the same "omnipotent, and infinitely wise maker" (Locke 9). Thus, Locke's limits liberty in the natural state far more stringently than Hobbes by introducing the obligation to refrain from harming both oneself and the others.<br/><br/>The differences between the two authors also manifest in their accounts of justice in the natural state of humanity. As far as Hobbes is concerned, delineating just and unjust practices is merely the matter of the law. There is no jurisprudence in the state of nature, and the only law governing human beings in their original condition is a natural law that only obliges them to seek personal security. As a result, nothing can be unjust in the original state of the humankind: "notions of right and wrong justice and injustice" have no place and no meaning in the absence of the stringently enforced law (Hobbes 78). As long as the people use their virtually unlimited freedom to ruthlessly compete with each other for resources, to which they are equally entitled, they have no criteria to differentiate between just and unjust actions. Therefore, the Hobbesian state of nature defies the very idea of justice since the author interprets it as a mere function of the formalized and established law.<br/><br/>Locke assigns different meaning to justice and views it not so much in legislative as in the ethical terms. This paper already mentioned that, unlike Hobbes, Locke employs ethical notions and generally bases his political philosophy on moral rather than purely practical presumptions. Locke's natural law, unlike that of Hobbes, obliges human beings to take care of each other rather than simply leaving everyone to fend for themselves. As a result, there is a place for justice and injustice in his state of nature. The author points to this fact himself when noting that no one should deprive another of his or her life of the means of preserving it "unless it be to do justice on an offender" (Locke 9). This statement reveals with the utmost clarity that, according to Locke, there is justice in the state of nature, and, moreover, humans have to preserve it actively. The criterion of justice, which Hobbes' natural state lacks, is the second limitation on natural liberty imposed by Locke: an action is unjust if it constitutes an unwarranted threat to another person's life and possessions.<br/><br/>These differences in the two authors' treatment of equality, liberty, and justice or injustice culminate in their interpretation of the relationship between the state of nature and the state of war. From Hobbes's perspective, the two are synonymous, because the ruthless competition is the only logical outcome of putting people with equivalent capabilities and similar needs in an environment with limited resources. He states this connection outright: "if any two men desire the same thing, which nevertheless they cannot both enjoy, they become enemies" and are, therefore, in the state of war with each other (Hobbes 75). Yet since humans are numerous and all possess similar capabilities and needs, this competition manifests not only in the individual interactions but also on the level of humanity as a whole. As long as all humans have equal and unlimited rights to all resources and even to each other's bodies and lives, the state of nature is a war of "every man against every man" (Hobbes 76). This grim interpretation stems directly from Hobbes' portrayal of the state of nature as governed solely by the individuals' egoistic urges.<br/><br/>Locke, on the other hand, differentiates between the state of nature and the state of war and points out that, while they may occur simultaneously, it is no reason to identify one with the other. Locke's definition of the state of war is virtually identical to that offered by Hobbes. According to Locke, "he who attempts to get another man into his absolute power does thereby put himself into a state of war with him" (14). This explanation lines up perfectly with the Hobbesian notion that everyone's universal right to everything, including the other people's bodies and lives, leads to the state of war. Yet Locke refuses to equate the state of war and the state of nature precisely because he denies Hobbes' interpretation of natural freedom. Since Locke's natural state restrains people from harming each other through the second limitation of liberty, an attempt on another person's freedom is a transgression against the natural law. While for Hobbes, war is the humankind's condition by default, Locke portrays it as a perversion of the state of nature rather than its rule.<br/><br/>These differences in delineating the state on nature and its constituents, such as liberty, equality, justice, and war, pave the way to the authors contrasting portrayals of government. Based on his pessimistic assessment of the state of nature, the author of Leviathan concludes that, under conditions of war, there can be no definite hope for "living out the time which nature ordinarily alloweth men to live" (Hobbes 80). The solution is laying down the universal right to everything and leaving everyone "so much liberty against other men, as he would allow other men against himself" (Hobbes 80). The participants of the resulting social contract invest the unlimited liberties they have surrendered into a sovereign – the bearer of the supreme power whose purpose is to preserve the achieved status quo by punishing all transgressions against it. Sovereign's power is absolute: the ruler has the authority "to do whatsoever he shall think necessary" to promote peace between his subjects so that no one would assail another's life or property (113). Hobbes concludes that without such an unassailable figure entitled with the right to do anything to the subjects, there can be no peace and no guarantee of security.<br/><br/>While Locke agrees with the necessity of creating politically organized societies, he nevertheless opposes Hobbes' idea of the sovereign power as unlimited and unassailable. As mentioned above, Locke's state of nature is not nearly as dreadful as that painted by Hobbes because of the people's obligation to preserve not only themselves but each other as well. Therefore, the need for social contract arises not from the fear of the others, but from the sheer convenience. Small communities may not need numerous laws to solve conflicts and "officers to superintend the process," but larger associations find it advisable to institute governments for that purpose (Locke 57). Yet the power of the government cannot be unlimited because it would result in subduing the subjects to an "inconstant, uncertain, unknown, arbitrary will of another man" (Locke 17). Such a government would constitute a twofold violation of the natural law. By agreeing to another person's absolute power over his life, a subject would violate its first limitation prohibiting to harm oneself. As for the ruler, destroying another person's liberty would constitute direct harm and, as such, be contradictory to the second limitation.<br/><br/>As a direct continuation of his case for unlimited governmental authority, Hobbes denies the separation of powers as a principle. From his perspective, the sovereign, once instituted, possesses "the whole power of prescribing the rules" governing the lives of the subjects or, in shorter terms, the legislative power (Hobbes 114). The sovereign also reserves the right of "hearing and deciding all controversies" – that is, the judicial power (Hobbes 114). Finally, since the entire purpose of the sovereign is to force the subjects to refrain from harming each other, there can be no doubt that executive power is also his or her exclusive prerogative. The separation of powers as a concept is alien to Hobbes because of his views on the state of nature. Creating a political entity where the executive, legislative, and judicial branches would check each other – that is, compete – would mean recreating the Hobbesian state of nature-as-war on a higher level. Since the people enter a social contract and institute a government to put the state of nature behind them, not reinstate it in a different form, the separation of powers contradictory Hobbes' views directly.<br/><br/>Locke, on the other hand, embraces separation of power as a foundational principle of his political theory. His case for the separation is evident in the discussion of the limits of the legislative power. As Locke puts it, it would be hardly advisable "for the same persons, who have the power of making laws, to have also in their hands the power to execute them" (76). The philosopher points to the imperfections of human nature and the inherent desire to "grasp at power" as a rationale for this precautionary measure (Locke 76). Just as in Hobbes' case, Locke's account of the separation of powers stems directly from his interpretation of the state of nature. If there is already justice in the state of nature and the people can understand it, any government is inevitably subject to the same natural law. Since absolute power over people violates both limitations of this law, separating and distributing it is advisable so that the government would function appropriately.<br/><br/>This paper has demonstrated that, while the differences between Hobbes' and Locke's accounts of the natural state of humanity are numerous, they ultimately amount to the presence of absence of moral premises. Hobbes views the natural state as that of unlimited liberty, where people endowed with equal capabilities and not bound by any moral notions, such as justice, compete for the resources unceasingly. Locke, however, interprets equality and liberty ethically rather than practically and opines that war is a perversion of the natural state, as the natural law obliges humans not to harm each other. This disagreement influences the philosophers' approaches to government. Hobbes insists on an all-powerful ruler, as, in the absence of ethical restraints, no other authority could force the humans to refrain from harming each other. Yet, in Locke's view, granting the government unlimited powers would be contradictory to the ethical limitations embedded in the law of nature, which is why he, unlike Hobbes, advocates separation of powers. | Hobbes' vs. Lockes beretning om naturtilstanden<br/><br/>Emne: FilosofiOrd: 2539Sider: 9Aug 3rd, 2021<br/><br/>Hobbes og Locke er blandt de mest indflydelsesrige politiske filosoffer, der nogensinde har skrevet på engelsk. Naturtilstanden, som går forud for organiseringen af de komplekse samfund, er den fælles forudsætning, at både Hobbes og Locke deler, men fortolker på forskellige måder. De førstnævnte betragter mennesker i deres naturlige tilstand som lige så farlige og frie til at forfølge deres egoistiske mål, der er ubegrænset af de ikke-eksisterende forestillinger om retfærdighed, hvilket er grunden til, at hans naturlige tilstand udgør "ethvert menneskes krig mod ethvert menneske" (Hobbes 76). Sidstnævnte ser derimod mennesker i deres oprindelige tilstand som lige så værdifulde og begrænser naturlig frihed ved ideen om retfærdighed, der kræver ikke at skade andre, hvilket gør det muligt at definere naturens tilstand som "gensidig bistand og bevarelse" snarere end krig (Locke 15). Hovedforskellen mellem de to filosoffers beretninger om naturtilstand er, at Locke bruger etiske overvejelser, mens Hobbes ikke gør det, og det fører i sidste ende Hobbes til at forestille sig en stat, der udøver ubegrænset magt over mennesker, mens Locke begrænser regeringen ved de moralske principper, som han betragter som en naturlov.<br/><br/>Hobbes baserer sine antagelser om naturtilstanden på det faktum, at alle mennesker er nogenlunde lige i deres fysiske og mentale evner. Han indrømmer, at nogle individer kan udvise større fysisk styrke eller højere intellekt, men insisterer på, at "når alt er regnet sammen, er forskellen mellem menneske og menneske ikke så stor" (Hobbes 74). Da mennesker er nogenlunde lige i deres evner, har de også lignende håb om at nå deres mål og tilfredsstille deres behov (Hobbes 75). Som et logisk resultat af denne lighed, når folk begynder at konkurrere om knappe ressourcer, kan ingen føle sig helt sikre i hans eller hendes ejendele. Selv om det lykkes en mægtig, snedig og dygtig person at underlægge sig "alle menneskers personer", så garanterer det alligevel ikke den ultimative sikkerhed (Hobbes 75). Da intet menneske kan opnå en sådan overlegenhed over de andre, der gør ham eller hende fuldstændig immun over for deres styrke af intellekt, kan intet menneske føle sig helt sikker, når omgivet af hans eller hendes ligemænd. Hobbes' lighed i den naturlige tilstand er lighed i frygt, hvor alle mennesker ser hinanden som farlige konkurrenter.<br/><br/>Ligesom Hobbes anser Locke alle mennesker for at være grundlæggende lige, men tildeler en helt anden betydning til udtrykket. Fra hans perspektiv er det ikke lighed i evner, men snarere lighed i værdi. Han mener, at folk "promiskuøst født til alle de samme fordele af naturen" logisk bør nyde den perfekte lighed blandt dem, da der ikke er nogen grund til at betragte nogen i sagens natur mere værdifulde (Locke 8). Det eneste mulige grundlag for at betegne nogle mennesker som overlegne i forhold til andre ville være, hvis Gud "ved en åbenbar erklæring af sin vilje satte den ene over den anden" (Locke 8). Da en sådan guddommelig godkendelse af overlegenhed er fraværende, konkluderer Locke, at den naturlige lighed mellem alle repræsentanter for menneskeheden ikke kan drages i tvivl. Hobbes nærmer sig lighed pragmatisk og understreger, at mennesker i deres naturlige tilstand er lige så farlige, men Locke anvender en etisk tilgang og understreger, at mennesker er lige så værdifulde i Guds øjne. Denne uenighed er blot den første forskel mellem de to forfattere baseret på det faktum, at Locke inkluderer Gud som en forudsætning i sin politiske filosofi, mens Hobbes ikke gør det.<br/><br/>Et andet karakteristisk træk ved Hobbes' beretning om naturtilstanden er hans fortolkning af friheden. Ifølge Hobbes indebærer naturtilstanden ubegrænset frihed til at gøre, hvad der er nødvendigt for ens fortsatte eksistens. Filosoffen definerer frihed som "fraværet af eksterne hindringer" i at bruge sine evner til at nå sine mål (Hobbes 79). Det primære formål med hvert sansende væsen er at opretholde sin fortsatte eksistens. Som følge heraf udgør den hobbesianske frihed den uhindrede mulighed for at gøre noget, der efter ens vurdering ville være bedst egnet til at bevare ens liv og ejendele (Hobbes 79). Den eneste begrænsning af friheden er, at en person ikke kan gøre noget i modstrid med at opretholde hans eller hendes liv eller ødelægge "midlerne til at bevare det samme" (Hobbes 79). Bortset fra det er der ingen grænser, og alle har "ret til alt, selv til hinandens krop", hvis det fremmer ens overlevelse (Hobbes 80). Således er naturlig frihed, som Hobbes ser det, fraværet af ydre påtvungne forhindringer i at forfølge ens ret til alt for at opretholde og sikre ens fortsatte eksistens.<br/><br/>Locke opretholder også ideen om naturlig frihed, men ikke overraskende nærmer det på en måde, der er væsentligt forskellig fra Hobbes. Så snart han begynder at diskutere frihed i naturtilstanden, bemærker han straks, at en frihedstilstand ikke svarer til "en licenstilstand" (Locke 9). Filosoffen identificerer to specifikke begrænsninger for menneskelig frihed i naturtilstanden. Den første er identisk med den, Hobbes introducerede: hvor fri og uafhængig en person end er, "har han dog ikke frihed til at ødelægge sig selv" (Locke 9). Ifølge Locke har ethvert menneske en naturlig forpligtelse til ikke at "skade en anden i hans liv, helbred, frihed eller ejendele" (9). Ligesom med hans fortolkning af lighed, forfatteren baserer denne påstand på etiske og religiøse grunde: mennesker bør bevare hinandens eksistens, da de alle er kreationer af den samme "omnipotent, og uendelig klog maker" (Locke 9). Således begrænser Lockes frihed i den naturlige tilstand langt strengere end Hobbes ved at indføre forpligtelsen til at afstå fra at skade både sig selv og de andre.<br/><br/>Forskellene mellem de to forfattere viser sig også i deres beretninger om retfærdighed i menneskehedens naturlige tilstand. Hvad angår Hobbes, er afgrænsning af retfærdige og uretfærdige praksisser blot et spørgsmål om loven. Der er ingen retspraksis i naturtilstanden, og den eneste lov, der styrer mennesker i deres oprindelige tilstand, er en naturlov, der kun forpligter dem til at søge personlig sikkerhed. Som følge heraf kan intet være uretfærdigt i menneskehedens oprindelige tilstand: "notioner om ret og uret retfærdighed og uretfærdighed" har ingen plads og ingen mening i fraværet af den strengt håndhævede lov (Hobbes 78). Så længe folk bruger deres næsten ubegrænsede frihed til hensynsløst at konkurrere med hinanden om ressourcer, som de har lige ret til, har de ingen kriterier for at skelne mellem retfærdige og uretfærdige handlinger. Derfor, den Hobbesian tilstand af naturen trodser selve ideen om retfærdighed, da forfatteren fortolker det som en simpel funktion af den formaliserede og etablerede lov.<br/><br/>Locke tildeler retfærdigheden en anden betydning og ser den ikke så meget i lovgivning som i etiske termer. Dette papir allerede nævnt, at i modsætning til Hobbes, Locke beskæftiger etiske forestillinger og generelt baserer sin politiske filosofi på moralske snarere end rent praktiske formodninger. Lockes naturlov, i modsætning til Hobbes, forpligter mennesker til at tage sig af hinanden i stedet for blot at lade alle klare sig selv. Som følge heraf er der plads til retfærdighed og uretfærdighed i hans naturtilstand. Forfatteren peger på dette faktum selv, når han bemærker, at ingen bør fratage en anden af hans eller hendes liv af midlerne til at bevare det "medmindre det er at gøre retfærdighed på en lovovertræder" (Locke 9). Denne erklæring afslører med den største klarhed, at der ifølge Locke er retfærdighed i naturtilstanden, og i øvrigt er mennesker nødt til at bevare den aktivt. Kriteriet for retfærdighed, som Hobbes 'naturlige tilstand mangler, er den anden begrænsning på naturlig frihed pålagt af Locke: en handling er uretfærdig, hvis den udgør en uberettiget trussel mod en anden persons liv og ejendele.<br/><br/>Disse forskelle i de to forfatteres behandling af lighed, frihed og retfærdighed eller uretfærdighed kulminerer i deres fortolkning af forholdet mellem naturtilstanden og krigstilstanden. Fra Hobbes perspektiv er de to synonyme, fordi den hensynsløse konkurrence er det eneste logiske resultat af at sætte mennesker med tilsvarende evner og lignende behov i et miljø med begrænsede ressourcer. Han erklærer denne forbindelse direkte: "hvis to mænd ønsker det samme, som de ikke desto mindre ikke begge kan nyde, bliver de fjender" og er derfor i krigstilstand med hinanden (Hobbes 75). Men da mennesker er talrige og alle besidder lignende evner og behov, manifesterer denne konkurrence ikke kun i de individuelle interaktioner, men også på menneskehedens niveau som helhed. Så længe alle mennesker har lige og ubegrænsede rettigheder til alle ressourcer og endda til hinandens kroppe og liv, er naturtilstanden en "hver mands krig mod hver mand" (Hobbes 76). Denne dystre fortolkning stammer direkte fra Hobbes' skildring af naturtilstanden, som udelukkende styres af individernes egoistiske drifter.<br/><br/>Locke skelner derimod mellem naturtilstanden og krigstilstanden og påpeger, at selv om de kan forekomme samtidig, er det ingen grund til at identificere sig med den anden. Lockes definition af krigstilstanden er stort set identisk med den, som Hobbes tilbyder. "Den, der forsøger at få en anden mand i sin absolutte magt, sætter sig dermed i krigstilstand med ham" (14). Denne forklaring stemmer perfekt overens med den hobbesianske forestilling om, at alles universelle ret til alt, herunder de andre folks kroppe og liv, fører til krigstilstanden. Alligevel nægter Locke at sidestille krigstilstanden og naturtilstanden netop fordi han benægter Hobbes' fortolkning af naturlig frihed. Da Lockes naturlige tilstand afholder folk fra at skade hinanden gennem frihedens anden begrænsning, er et forsøg på en anden persons frihed en overtrædelse af naturloven. Mens for Hobbes, krig er menneskehedens tilstand som standard, Locke skildrer det som en perversion af naturtilstanden snarere end dens regel.<br/><br/>Disse forskelle i afgrænsning af staten på naturen og dens bestanddele, såsom frihed, lighed, retfærdighed og krig, bane vejen for forfatterne kontrasterende skildringer af regeringen. Baseret på hans pessimistiske vurdering af naturtilstanden konkluderer forfatteren af Leviathan, at der under krigsforhold ikke kan være noget definitivt håb om at "leve ud af den tid, som naturen normalt tillader mennesker at leve" (Hobbes 80). Løsningen er at nedlægge den universelle ret til alt og efterlade enhver "så megen frihed mod andre mennesker, som han ville tillade andre mennesker mod sig selv" (Hobbes 80). Deltagerne i den resulterende sociale kontrakt investerer de ubegrænsede friheder, de har overgivet til en suveræn - bæreren af den øverste magt, hvis formål er at bevare den opnåede status quo ved at straffe alle overtrædelser mod den. Herskerens magt er absolut: Herskeren har myndighed "til at gøre, hvad han finder nødvendigt" for at fremme fred mellem sine undersåtter, så ingen vil angribe en andens liv eller ejendom (113). Hobbes konkluderer, at uden en sådan uangribelig figur med ret til at gøre noget for undersåtterne, kan der ikke være nogen fred og ingen garanti for sikkerhed.<br/><br/>Mens Locke er enig i nødvendigheden af at skabe politisk organiserede samfund, er han ikke desto mindre imod Hobbes' idé om den suveræne magt som ubegrænset og uangribelig. Som nævnt ovenfor er Lockes naturtilstand ikke nær så forfærdelig som den, der blev malet af Hobbes på grund af folkets forpligtelse til at bevare ikke kun sig selv, men også hinanden. Derfor opstår behovet for social kontrakt ikke af frygt for de andre, men fra den rene bekvemmelighed. Små samfund har måske ikke brug for mange love for at løse konflikter og "officerer til at overvåge processen", men større foreninger finder det tilrådeligt at indføre regeringer til dette formål (Locke 57). Alligevel kan regeringens magt ikke være ubegrænset, fordi det ville resultere i at underkaste undersåtterne en "ukonstant, usikker, ukendt, vilkårlig vilje hos en anden mand" (Locke 17). En sådan regering ville udgøre en dobbelt overtrædelse af naturloven. Ved at acceptere en anden persons absolutte magt over sit liv, ville et emne overtræde sin første begrænsning, der forbyder at skade sig selv. Med hensyn til herskeren, ville ødelægge en anden persons frihed udgøre direkte skade, og som sådan, være i modstrid med den anden begrænsning.<br/><br/>Som en direkte fortsættelse af sin sag om ubegrænset regeringsmyndighed benægter Hobbes magtens adskillelse som princip. Fra hans synsvinkel besidder den suveræne, når han først er indstiftet, "hele magten til at foreskrive de regler", der styrer undersåttens liv eller, i kortere vendinger, den lovgivende magt (Hobbes 114). Den suveræne forbeholder sig også retten til at "høre og afgøre alle kontroverser" - det vil sige den dømmende magt (Hobbes 114). Endelig, da suverænens hele formål er at tvinge undersåtterne til at afstå fra at skade hinanden, kan der ikke være nogen tvivl om, at den udøvende magt også er hans eller hendes eksklusive prærogativ. Opdelingen af beføjelser som begreb er fremmed for Hobbes på grund af hans syn på naturtilstanden. Oprettelse af en politisk enhed, hvor de udøvende, lovgivende og dømmende grene ville kontrollere hinanden - det vil sige konkurrere - ville betyde at genskabe den hobbesianske naturtilstand på et højere niveau. Da folket indgår en social kontrakt og indfører en regering for at lægge naturtilstanden bag sig, ikke genindføre den i en anden form, modsiger magtens adskillelse direkte Hobbes' synspunkter.<br/><br/>Locke, på den anden side, omfavner magtens adskillelse som et grundlæggende princip i hans politiske teori. Hans sag for adskillelsen er tydelig i diskussionen af grænserne for den lovgivende magt. Som Locke udtrykker det, ville det næppe være tilrådeligt "for de samme personer, der har magt til at lave love, at have også i deres hænder magt til at udføre dem" (76). Filosoffen peger på den menneskelige naturs ufuldkommenheder og det iboende ønske om at "gribe magten" som en begrundelse for denne forebyggende foranstaltning (Locke 76). Ligesom i Hobbes' tilfælde stammer Lockes beretning om magtens adskillelse direkte fra hans fortolkning af naturtilstanden. Hvis der allerede er retfærdighed i naturtilstanden, og folket kan forstå den, er enhver regering uundgåeligt underlagt den samme naturlov. Da den absolutte magt over mennesker overtræder begge begrænsninger af denne lov, er det tilrådeligt at adskille og distribuere det, så regeringen ville fungere korrekt.<br/><br/>Dette papir har vist, at mens forskellene mellem Hobbes 'og Lockes beretninger om den naturlige tilstand af menneskeheden er talrige, de i sidste ende udgør tilstedeværelsen af fravær af moralske præmisser. Hobbes ser den naturlige tilstand som den af ubegrænset frihed, hvor mennesker udstyret med lige evner og ikke bundet af nogen moralske forestillinger, såsom retfærdighed, konkurrerer om ressourcerne uophørligt. Locke fortolker imidlertid lighed og frihed etisk snarere end praktisk og mener, at krig er en perversion af den naturlige tilstand, da naturloven forpligter mennesker til ikke at skade hinanden. Denne uenighed påvirker filosoffernes tilgang til regeringen. Hobbes insisterer på en almægtig hersker, da ingen anden myndighed i mangel af etiske begrænsninger kunne tvinge menneskene til at afstå fra at skade hinanden. Alligevel, efter Lockes opfattelse, at give regeringen ubegrænset beføjelser ville være i modstrid med de etiske begrænsninger indlejret i naturloven, hvilket er grunden til, at han, i modsætning til Hobbes, fortaler adskillelse af beføjelser. |
| Fashion Police: What Game of Thrones threw up<br/><br/>Canadian-French singer Abbas Hasan put blinding effort to outshine all of humanity at Fashion Parade 2014. Nothing wrong with that, except safety is priority and the musician is a health hazard here.<br/><br/>We get he wants to be a star. Sadly, he didn't get the memo where they tell the desperate and the infamous that stardom is a metaphor. You don't have to look like one and literally set our sight ablaze. Also, the All Pakistan Aunty Association has officially lodged a complaint against him. The local market has run dry of fake crystals and sequined monstrosities. They have nothing to wear to their biweekly high teas and they claim he is to blame. Apparently, the outfit is inspired by Game of Thrones. Can he please stick to composing sad songs about his neighbour's dead dog instead of conceptualising outfits? Or maybe it's the trauma of losing the dog, whose death he is clearly not over as he is still wearing its carcass.<br/><br/>The charge sheet Outfit<br/><br/>No one can decide where the outfit begins and where Abbas ends. You stare in fascination, sinking into a deep abyss and wonder why he is wearing leather pants. Whose horse did he kill to steal the saddle draped across his shoulders? Was he in prison right before his red carpet appearance and forgot to take off the chains? How will he survive the synthetic leather and post-sequin rash that is bound to be lethal in such high dosage? Why am I still alive?<br/><br/>Idea<br/><br/>His inspiration was seemingly Game of Thrones, but he eventually ended up looking like he was thrown out of a Viking restaurant. Had he come across any of the characters from the show, he would've been slain in the first five seconds of the first episode.<br/><br/>The mental health or lack thereof: Someone get him to a counsellor ASAP! He seems to be under the assumption that wearing a dead dog means that the only friend he had in his life is still alive. Dear Abbas:<br/><br/>1. Denial is not a river in Egypt<br/><br/>2. Your tortured psyche is not helping your music, so get help<br/><br/>3. Try imaginary friends<br/><br/>Bail out!<br/><br/>All of us at the Fashion Police headquarters are severely traumatised. Abbas is someone we did not enjoy arresting. He is currently in custody and attempting revenge by putting on attires from other fantasy shows. He just glitter glued himself in order to look like Edward Cullen from Twilight. As a public service message and to prevent further nervous breakdowns, we gave him the following examples of men from the red carpet of the same event.<br/><br/>Zohaib Hassan<br/><br/>When in doubt, play it safe. The singer looks like your average uncle at a shaadi. A plain black suit with no accessories, even if it's a tad disproportionate, is workable. Zohaib's look is blended into everything and nothing, and when you don't have a fashion sense or the money to hire a stylist, this is okay. It does not carry the risk of cardiac arrest for fellow attendees at an event. Given Abbas' delicate mental condition, this look is what he should aim for. Always and forever.<br/><br/>Ali Zafar<br/><br/>One day, after decades of therapy, Abbas could aspire to wear attire like Ali Zafar's. The dapper summer look is done to near perfection. Ali came really close to looking like a maître d at a French restaurant with his white summer jacket with black lapels, but the shirt saves it, never mind the satin. His pants would have been ridiculous had they not been folded at the ankles. The shoes are what hipster chic happy endings are made of. | Fashion Police: Hvad Game of Thrones kastede op<br/><br/>Den canadisk-franske sanger Abbas Hasan satte en blændende indsats for at overstråle hele menneskeheden på Fashion Parade 2014. Intet galt med det, bortset fra sikkerhed er prioriteret, og musikeren er en sundhedsfare her.<br/><br/>Vi forstår, at han vil være en stjerne. Desværre fik han ikke det memo, hvor de fortæller de desperate og den berygtede, at stjernestatus er en metafor. Du behøver ikke at ligne en og bogstaveligt talt sætte vores syn i brand. Også, All Pakistan Aunty Association har officielt indgivet en klage mod ham. Det lokale marked har løbet tør for falske krystaller og paljetterede monstrositeter. De har intet at bære til deres hver anden uge høje te, og de hævder, at han er skylden. Tilsyneladende er tøjet inspireret af Game of Thrones. Kan han venligst holde sig til at komponere triste sange om sin nabos døde hund i stedet for at konceptualisere tøj? Eller måske er det traumet af at miste hunden, hvis død han tydeligvis ikke er overstået, da han stadig bærer sin krop.<br/><br/>Opladningsarket Outfit<br/><br/>Ingen kan bestemme, hvor tøjet begynder, og hvor Abbas ender. Du stirrer i fascination, synker ned i en dyb afgrund og spekulerer på, hvorfor han er iført læderbukser. Hvis hest gjorde han dræbe for at stjæle sadlen draperet over hans skuldre? Var han i fængsel lige før hans røde løber udseende og glemte at tage kæderne af? Hvordan vil han overleve syntetisk læder og post-sequin udslæt, der er bundet til at være dødelig i så høj dosis? Hvorfor er jeg stadig i live?<br/><br/>Idé<br/><br/>Hans inspiration var tilsyneladende Game of Thrones, men han endte med at se ud som om han blev smidt ud af en Viking-restaurant. Havde han stødt på nogen af figurerne fra showet, ville han være blevet dræbt i de første fem sekunder af den første episode.<br/><br/>Den mentale sundhed eller mangel deraf: Nogen få ham til en rådgiver ASAP! Han synes at være under den antagelse, at iført en død hund betyder, at den eneste ven, han havde i sit liv, stadig er i live. Kære Abbas:<br/><br/>1. Fornægtelse er ikke en flod i Egypten<br/><br/>2. Din torturerede psyke hjælper ikke din musik, så få hjælp<br/><br/>3. Prøv imaginære venner<br/><br/>Bail ud!<br/><br/>Alle os på Fashion Police hovedkvarteret er alvorligt traumatiseret. Abbas er en person, vi ikke nød at arrestere. Han er i øjeblikket i varetægt og forsøger hævn ved at sætte på klæder fra andre fantasy shows. Han bare glitter limet sig for at ligne Edward Cullen fra Twilight. Som en public service besked og for at forhindre yderligere nervøse sammenbrud, vi gav ham følgende eksempler på mænd fra den røde løber af samme begivenhed.<br/><br/>Zohaib Hassan<br/><br/>Når du er i tvivl, skal du spille det sikkert. Sangeren ligner din gennemsnitlige onkel på en shaadi. En almindelig sort jakkesæt uden tilbehør, selvom det er en smule uforholdsmæssigt, er brugbar. Zohaibs udseende er blandet ind i alt og intet, og når du ikke har en modefornemmelse eller pengene til at ansætte en stylist, er det okay. Det bærer ikke risikoen for hjertestop for andre deltagere ved et arrangement. I betragtning af Abbas' delikate mentale tilstand, er dette udseende, hvad han bør sigte efter, altid og for evigt.<br/><br/>Ali Zafar<br/><br/>En dag, efter årtiers terapi, kunne Abbas stræbe efter at bære påklædning som Ali Zafars. Det dapper sommerudseende er gjort til næsten perfektion. Ali kom virkelig tæt på at ligne en maitre d på en fransk restaurant med sin hvide sommerjakke med sorte lapels, men skjorten sparer det, lige meget satinen. Hans bukser ville have været latterlige, hvis de ikke var blevet foldet ved anklerne. Skoene er hvad hipster chic happy endings er lavet af. |
| Determining soil hydraulic properties with different wetting liquids : A thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the Degree of Master of Science at Lincoln University<br/><br/>Abstract<br/><br/>Soil hydraulic properties such as hydraulic conductivity, water retention and plant water relationships dominate the water movement processes. For example, the infiltration, evaporation and water flow within the soil. As a widespread phenomenon in soil, soil water repellency alters the soil hydraulic functions by resisting the water flow into the soils. Moreover, the hydraulic properties not only depend on the pore system of soil but also are affected by the physicochemical properties of the pore surfaces. Compared to water, ethanol is not affected by the water repellency due to its lower surface tension. The purpose of using ethanol is to eliminate the effect of soil water repellency on hydraulic properties measurements. However, applying pure ethanol into natural soil can degrade the soil organic materials and lead to changes in physical properties. Therefore, the aqueous ethanol solutions can be an alternative option. Nevertheless, the feasibility of using aqueous ethanol for determining soil liquid retention curve remains unknown. This study aims to test the feasibility of the aqueous ethanol solutions (0, 10 %, 20 %, 30 %, 40 %, 50 % and 100 % v/v) for establishing liquid retention curve under a small range of applied pressure in coarse sand samples with different wettability and organic amended natural soil (Templeton silt loam (TSL) with mushroom compost, biochar, dairy effluent, and municipal compost, the application rate was 15 % by weight). The result showed that the desorption of testing aqueous ethanol solutions compared to water was quicker by approximately 1 to 3x based on the liquid content at the same applied pressure and the time for reaching each equilibrium. The outcomes from the sand experiment suggested that when the concentration of aqueous ethanol solution was below 50 %, the losses via evaporation were less than 1% and the relative differences between testing liquid and water was lower than 10 %. However, the evaporation losses were 11.06 % and 24.6 %, and the relative differences were all around 15 % and 30 % in 50 % and 100 % ethanol solution, respectively. In contrast, the organic amendments in Templeton silt loam not only increased the water retention capability but also reduced the evaporation losses. The evaporation losses in TSL soil and TSL with organic amendments soil were with 1 % in solutions with less than 50 % ethanol content. Evaporation losses of 50 % and 100 % ethanol were 2.8 % and 2.9 %, respectively. The relative differences between water and testing liquid were similar to the sand experiment when the testing liquid concentrations were below 50 %. However, the relative differences in 50 % and 100 % ethanol solution were smaller than in the sand sample with around 10 % and 15%, respectively. Additionally, the analysis of relative difference suggested that almost all aqueous ethanol solutions had lower volumetric liquid content at the same supplied pressure compared to water, which was a reflection of the aqueous ethanol solutions desorbed faster than water under equivalent pressure. Therefore, 10 % to 40 % of ethanol solutions could be considered an alternative for determining soil hydraulic properties due to their faster desorption rate and not being affected by soil water repellency. Due to the evaporation and dissolution of organic material, aqueous ethanol solutions above 50% concentration were not suitable for coarse sand or medium-textured soil.... [Show full abstract] | Fastlæggelse af jordhydrauliske egenskaber med forskellige befugtningsvæsker : En afhandling indsendt i delvis opfyldelse af kravene til Master of Science på Lincoln University<br/><br/>Abstract<br/><br/>Jordhydrauliske egenskaber som hydraulisk ledningsevne, vandretention og plantevandsforhold dominerer vandbevægelsesprocesserne. For eksempel infiltration, fordampning og vandstrøm i jorden. Som et udbredt fænomen i jord, jord vandafvisning ændrer jord hydrauliske funktioner ved at modstå vandstrømmen i jorden. Desuden afhænger de hydrauliske egenskaber ikke kun af poresystemet af jord, men påvirkes også af de fysisk-kemiske egenskaber af poreoverfladerne. Sammenlignet med vand påvirkes ethanol ikke af vandafvisningen på grund af dens lavere overfladespænding. Formålet med at bruge ethanol er at eliminere effekten af jordvandsafvisning på målinger af hydrauliske egenskaber. Anvendelse af ren ethanol i naturlig jord kan imidlertid nedbryde jordens organiske materialer og føre til ændringer i fysiske egenskaber. Derfor kan de vandige ethanolopløsninger være en alternativ mulighed. Ikke desto mindre er muligheden for at anvende vandig ethanol til bestemmelse af jordvæskeretentionskurven stadig ukendt. Formålet med denne undersøgelse er at teste gennemførligheden af de vandige ethanolopløsninger (0, 10 %, 20 %, 30 %, 40 %, 50 % og 100 % v/v) til bestemmelse af væskeretentionskurven under et lille trykområde i grove sandprøver med forskellig fugtbarhed og organisk ændret naturlig jord (Templeton silt loam (TSL) med champignonkompost, biokul, mejeri spildevand og kommunal kompost, hvor påføringsgraden var 15 vægtprocent). Resultaterne viste, at desorptionen af testning af vandige ethanolopløsninger sammenlignet med vand var hurtigere med ca. 1 til 3x baseret på væskeindholdet ved det samme påførte tryk og tidspunktet for at nå hver ligevægt. Resultaterne fra sandeksperimentet tydede på, at når koncentrationen af vandig ethanolopløsning var under 50 %, var tabene ved fordampning mindre end 1 %, og de relative forskelle mellem testvæske og vand var mindre end 10 %. Fordampningstabene var imidlertid 11,06 % og 24,6 %, og de relative forskelle var alle omkring 15 % og 30 % i henholdsvis 50 % og 100 % ethanolopløsning. I modsætning hertil øgede de organiske ændringer i Templeton silt loam ikke kun vandophobningsevnen, men reducerede også fordampningstabene. Fordampningstabene i TSL-jord og TSL med organiske ændringer var med 1 % i opløsninger med mindre end 50 % ethanolindhold. Fordampningstabene på 50 % og 100 % ethanol var henholdsvis 2,8 % og 2,9 %. De relative forskelle mellem vand og testvæske svarede til sandforsøget, når testvæskekoncentrationerne var under 50 %. De relative forskelle i 50 % og 100 % ethanolopløsning var dog mindre end i sandprøven med henholdsvis ca. 10 % og 15 %. Analysen af den relative forskel tydede desuden på, at næsten alle vandige ethanolopløsninger havde et lavere volumenindhold i væsken ved det samme tilførte tryk sammenlignet med vand, hvilket var en afspejling af de vandige ethanolopløsninger, der desorberede hurtigere end vand under ækvivalent tryk. Derfor kan 10 % til 40 % af ethanolopløsningerne betragtes som et alternativ til bestemmelse af jordhydrauliske egenskaber på grund af deres hurtigere desorptionshastighed og ikke påvirkes af jordvandafvisende egenskaber. På grund af fordampning og opløsning af organisk materiale, vandige ethanol opløsninger over 50% koncentration var ikke egnet til groft sand eller medium-tekstureret jord. |
