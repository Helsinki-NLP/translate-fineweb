| Quidditch through the ages<br/><br/>I was doodling some quidditch-related objects like broomsticks and snitches and whatnot and it sort of turned into this odd compilation of things, including Harry down there at the bottom. I am not completely satisfied with the way it came out, but since it's not bad for my second Harry Potter fan-art picture, I decided to color it anyway. If you are wondering where his scar is, it's there, but it's very very light and small because I did that bit on the computer. Sketched in pen, colored in Paint. | Quidditch gennem tiderne<br/><br/>Jeg doodling nogle quidditch-relaterede objekter som kosteskafter og stikkere og hvad ikke, og det slags forvandlet til denne mærkelige samling af ting, herunder Harry dernede i bunden. Jeg er ikke helt tilfreds med den måde, det kom ud, men da det ikke er dårligt for mit andet Harry Potter fan-art billede, besluttede jeg at farve det alligevel. Hvis du spekulerer på, hvor hans ar er, er det der, men det er meget let og lille, fordi jeg gjorde det lidt på computeren. Sketched i pen, farvet i Paint. |
| I just started saltwater fly fishing this summer and I need a new reel, so it'll definitely be the Kraken. (I'm in Florida; we don't have those little trout minnow things around here. ) Private Message on the way to you.<br/><br/>I'm thrilled and flattered. I'm also trying to figure out a way to explain to She-Who-Must-Be-Obeyed that I'll need to buy a new rod worthy of this reel.....<br/><br/>I've always found that no explanation is the best explanation. Don't give her a reason to ever say you're not spontaneous enough. | Jeg er lige startet på saltvandsfluefiskeri i sommer, og jeg har brug for et nyt hjul, så det bliver helt sikkert Kraken. (Jeg er i Florida, vi har ikke de små ørred minnow ting her omkring.) Privat besked på vej til dig.<br/><br/>Jeg er glad og smigret, og jeg prøver også at forklare She-Who-Must-Be-Adlyed, at jeg skal købe en ny stang, der er værdig til dette hjul.....<br/><br/>Jeg har altid fundet ud af, at ingen forklaring er den bedste forklaring. |
| If you were admitted and enrolled --> yes If you were admitted and attended another school --> yes If you took extension courses (do they even have them there? I know UCLA does) --> yes If you went to graduate school there --> yes<br/><br/>That's my interpretation because any of these scenarios would fulfill either being "admitted to an undergraduate program" or "taking courses" at UC Berkeley. I could be completely wrong though, you're better off just calling them and clarifying your specific situation.<br/><br/>My opinion: Based on the wording, I interpreted it as asking if you were admitted to Berkeley undergrad, whether or not you chose to attend. If it meant admitted and attended, they could easily have seen that through the "Undergrad Institutions" portion of the application. | Hvis du blev optaget og indskrevet --> ja Hvis du blev optaget og deltog i en anden skole --> ja Hvis du tog forlængelseskurser (har de endda dem der? Jeg ved, at UCLA gør) --> ja Hvis du gik på kandidatskole der --> ja<br/><br/>Det er min fortolkning, fordi nogen af disse scenarier ville opfylde enten at være "indlagt på et bachelorprogram" eller "tage kurser" på UC Berkeley. Jeg kan være helt forkert, men du er bedre stillet bare at ringe til dem og afklare din specifikke situation.<br/><br/>Min mening: Baseret på ordlyden tolkede jeg det som at spørge, om du blev optaget på Berkeley bachelor, om du valgte at deltage eller ej. Hvis det betød optagelse og deltog, kunne de nemt have set det gennem "Undergrad Institutions" -delen af ansøgningen. |
| ...........A lot of the time head bolts are angle tightened so you set them at say 20Nm for a starting point then angle tighten them from there.<br/><br/>.....I would have preferred a bigger hammer<br/><br/>Cheers.<br/><br/>You can never have too big a hammer<br/><br/>I'll confess.<br/>There must be a fine distinction between torque setting with a Click torque wrench and angle setting but even as an engineer, I don't really understand it.<br/><br/>To me, if you tighten a bolt you get to a point when it locks. And as TTT says at a relatively low torque. After that, further tightening both increases the torque load and the head angle ??<br/><br/>To me it's a distinction between measurement techniques rather then final result. If anyone can explain why one instead of the other I'd be greatful ??<br/><br/>I'm sure other old farts will remember old style torque wrenches with the separate pointer that swung around a graduated scale as you put load on them.<br/>Graduated in Ft Lbs, measurement in angle.<br/>Aren't these just a variation on the theme ?? | .............En masse af tiden hovedbolte er vinkel strammet, så du sætter dem på sige 20Nm for et udgangspunkt derefter vinkel stramme dem derfra.<br/><br/>Jeg ville have foretrukket en større hammer.<br/><br/>Skål.<br/><br/>Man kan aldrig få for stor en hammer<br/><br/>Jeg tilstår.<br/>Der skal være en fin skelnen mellem momentindstilling med en Click momentnøgle og vinkelindstilling, men selv som ingeniør forstår jeg det ikke rigtig.<br/><br/>For mig, hvis du strammer en bolt, kommer du til et punkt, når den låses. Og som TTT siger ved et relativt lavt drejningsmoment. Derefter øger yderligere stramning både momentbelastningen og hovedvinklen ??<br/><br/>For mig er det en skelnen mellem måleteknikker snarere end det endelige resultat. Hvis nogen kan forklare, hvorfor den ene i stedet for den anden ville jeg være stor ??<br/><br/>Jeg er sikker på, at andre gamle prutter vil huske gamle stil momentnøgler med den separate pointer, der svingede rundt om en gradueret skala, da du lægger belastning på dem.<br/>Uddannet i Ft Lbs, måling i vinkel.<br/>Er det ikke bare en variant af emnet?? |
| Winter Protection for Fig Trees<br/><br/>Report This Article<br/><br/>Winter Protection for Fig Trees<br/><br/>Overview<br/><br/>The fig tree has been around since at least 5,000 B.C., and is grown throughout the world for its delicious fruit. Figs grow well in a mild climate without weather extremes. The fig tree is now propagated in some areas with harsh winters. Protective precautions are required to save the tree from winter damage.<br/><br/>Potted Fig Trees<br/><br/>Ornamental fig trees in pots can stand some freezing and do not require light once they enter the winter dormancy phase. Avoid extreme swings in temperature by placing the fig tree in a controlled environment such as a garage, where temperatures range between slightly under freezing and slight above. The plant should be watered as the soil dries.<br/><br/>Shielding<br/><br/>Shielding to protect the tree from the most extreme winter weather is required. Fig trees require placement in soil areas where the soil does not freeze to protect it from disease and increase its chances of winter survival. Large screens placed around the tree protects it from winter winds that can damage and freeze the wood.<br/><br/>Wrapping<br/><br/>Tree wrapping protects the tree from cold weather and prevents hard winds from destroying the branches. Fig tree wrapping should be applied once the leaves from the tree have fallen to prevent leaves from rotting inside the wrapping material. Fig trees are sensitive to slight temperature changes. It can not warm up inside the protective film or else the tree may begin to grow, making it susceptible to severe damage during the cold snap.<br/><br/>Planting<br/><br/>Cultivar practices help to protect the fig tree during harsh winters. Varieties that are resistant to cold weather are best for locations where the weathers are harsh. Brown Turkey, Brunswick and Blue Celeste are good cultivars for cold weather. Planting should be done against a wall or structure that will radiate heat towards the tree during the winter months.<br/><br/>Snow<br/><br/>Roots of the fig tree require dry soil during the winter dormancy period. Watering should be done only when the soil is dry and the roots should be protected from melting snow and rain. Protection placed on the ground under the tree, near the trunk--to keep water from draining into the soil--protects the tree from damage.<br/><br/>Keywords:<br/>fig tree protection, fig tree winter, fig tree care | Vinterbeskyttelse til figentræer<br/><br/>Rapportér denne artikel<br/><br/>Vinterbeskyttelse til figentræer<br/><br/>Oversigt<br/><br/>Figentræet har eksisteret siden mindst 5.000 f.Kr., og dyrkes over hele verden for sin lækre frugt. Figen vokser godt i et mildt klima uden vejrekstremer. Figentræet formeres nu i nogle områder med hårde vintre. Der kræves beskyttelsesforanstaltninger for at redde træet fra vinterskader.<br/><br/>Pottet figentræer<br/><br/>Dekorative figentræer i potter kan tåle lidt frysning og kræver ikke lys, når de går ind i vinterdvalefasen. Undgå ekstreme temperatursvingninger ved at placere figentræet i et kontrolleret miljø, såsom en garage, hvor temperaturen varierer mellem lidt under frysning og lidt over. Planten skal vandes som jorden tørrer.<br/><br/>Afskærmning<br/><br/>Afskærmning for at beskytte træet mod det mest ekstreme vintervejr er påkrævet. Figentræer kræver placering i jordområder, hvor jorden ikke fryser for at beskytte den mod sygdom og øge sine chancer for vinteroverlevelse. Store skærme placeret omkring træet beskytter det mod vintervinde, der kan beskadige og fryse træet.<br/><br/>Indpakning<br/><br/>Træindpakning beskytter træet mod koldt vejr og forhindrer hårde vinde i at ødelægge grenene. Fig træindpakning skal påføres, når bladene fra træet er faldet for at forhindre bladene i at rådne inde i indpakningsmaterialet. Figentræer er følsomme over for små temperaturændringer. Det kan ikke varme op inde i beskyttelsesfilmen, ellers kan træet begynde at vokse, hvilket gør det modtageligt for alvorlig skade under den kolde snap.<br/><br/>Plantning<br/><br/>Dyrkningspraksis hjælper med at beskytte figentræet under hårde vintre. Sorter, der er modstandsdygtige over for koldt vejr, er bedst til steder, hvor vejret er hårdt. Brunt Tyrkiet, Brunswick og Blue Celeste er gode sorter til koldt vejr. Plantning skal ske mod en væg eller struktur, der vil udstråle varme mod træet i vintermånederne.<br/><br/>Sne<br/><br/>Rødder af figentræet kræver tør jord i vinterdvaleperioden. Vanding bør kun ske, når jorden er tør, og rødderne skal beskyttes mod smeltende sne og regn. Beskyttelse placeret på jorden under træet, nær stammen - for at holde vand fra dræning i jorden - beskytter træet mod skader.<br/><br/>Nøgleord:<br/>figen træ beskyttelse, figen træ vinter, figen træ pleje |
| Oculus CEO comes down hard on Mac support for the Rift<br/><br/>Oculus CEO, Palmer Luckey, has not minced his words when asked in an interview whether the Rift VR headset will ever support the Mac. If you had any hopes of it being soon, you might want to ready yourselves for some disappointment.<br/><br/>That is up to Apple. If they ever release a good computer, we will do it.<br/><br/>What he's referring to there in a less diplomatic sense is the discrete graphics required to run the Rift. The simple truth is that Apple just doesn't go for high-end graphics that will meet the requirements for the headset. For context, on a Windows PC, you need a minimum of an NVIDIA GTX 970, a $300 graphics card.<br/><br/>As Luckey went on to say:<br/><br/>It just boils down to the fact that Apple doesn't prioritize high-end GPUs. You can buy a $6,000 Mac Pro with the top of the line AMD FirePro D700, and it still doesn't match our recommended specs. So if they prioritize higher-end GPUs like they used to for a while back in the day, we'd love to support Mac. But right now, there's just not a single machine out there that supports it.<br/><br/>The Mac Pro can't be accused of not packing plenty of horsepower, because it does, but equally FirePro graphics are targeted more towards the creative market, just like the Mac Pro. The Mac Pro in particular far exceeds other hardware requirements, but naturally as the Rift is graphics heavy, this is where the shortfall is. Luckey is perhaps being a little over the top, but equally he's the man behind the Rift, so there's no doubts plenty of truth to what he says. Even if he doesn't say it particularly well.<br/><br/>What say you, Mac owners of the world? Are you even bothered about the Oculus Rift or is it something you wish you could have? Sound off in the comments below!<br/><br/>Reader comments<br/><br/>Oculus CEO comes down hard on Mac support for the Rift<br/><br/>No, not bothered by it since I really wasn't planning on buying an Oculus Rift. For me the product category is still too early and too much in a beta-kinda phase. But he does rise a valid point. Apple should try to get more ahead of the pack CPU/GPU wise. Right now they're always trailing behind.<br/><br/>Excuse me, but what is HTC Vive better at? And Oculus Rift most certainly supports Linux machines that meet their hardware specifications! (The issue is not OS but hardware.)<br/><br/>Also, look at WHY the HTC Vive supports OS X: it includes more of its own hardware. (Which is why it costs so much.) The Oculus solutions - both the Rift and the Samsung Gear VR - require the hardware that it is plugging into to perform more of the heavy lifting.<br/><br/>VR isn't a gimmick. 3D TVs don't always give that much of a 3d effect, and it doesn't work with everyone. VR works with everyone, and the Oculus and HTC Vive official release products have almost no latency so there shoudn't be any motion sickness. There's also plenty of game support<br/><br/>Obviously if gaming is a priority you're generally not in the market for a Mac, though. Not many game developers support OSX so these types of devices likely have limited use on a Mac (for gaming, anyways, which the Rift was designed for). At least that's the only reason I could see myself using one. I definitely wouldn't use it for watching movies.<br/><br/>Apple did implement the Metal engine into El Capitan, there might be some plan to go into the gaming market (as Apple learned from iOS how big this market is, just look at the top grossing apps).<br/>So now the hardware is missing and and game devs would probably show some interest, since Macs there are now an acceptable amount of Mac users around the world.<br/><br/>I would like to see Apple make its way into that sector of the industry. I don't use any Apple products presently but they're making a lot of the right moves in many areas and I'm very intrigued.<br/><br/>Plus, competition fuels innovation. I know that major computer part manufactures already create that competition but Apple has the RnD willpower and the cash to really turn heads. They may not win the numbers games in terms of specs, they actually rarely do, but most people who care to do the research know that performance != the sum of the device's parts. Apple can do more with "less". On paper their products appear inferior but when carefully balanced hardware meets specifically engineered software they generally perform just as well as the competition if not out perform.<br/><br/>HA! I love how, all of a sudden, having a high performance computer is not important to Apple phans! There is not a single Mac capable of the highest end graphics. Can't buy one, can't build one. Mac is not capable of being the highest in performance and you are good with that. HA! Classic!<br/><br/>I bought my MacBook Pro Retina in 2012 because of the high resolution screen and the non-discrete GPU. However, for my desktop I built a system with a 4K monitor, i7 4790K CPU, 3 GTX 970 GPU's, and 16 gb of memory all for less than what I'd pay for an iMac. I even have an SSD set up to boot in OSX. My point is Apple could do similar things if it wished, but doesn't. In fact, look at the most recent iMac. It includes discrete graphics and a slow 5400 RPM drive. My computer may not look as pretty, and it's not as thin, but in the end it's more useful - isn't that why we buy a computer in the first place?<br/><br/>I don't see why a Mac pro can not make use of the Oculus isn't it built for rendering video. I understand that it will not be able to run on iMac's and because of this the Oculus should be branded for Pro users due to the requirements and come at the price.<br/><br/>Now people are saying that your computer is doing ALL the heavy lifting, so why is the price point over $800 for something that isn't doing anything?<br/><br/>I'm excited about the direction of VR but not where it is at the moment.<br/><br/>Your display (which the Rift is) never does any of the heavy lifting. It's $800 because of what the display does; 110° viewing angle (still not human eye but much closer than other displays) with super low latency to reduce or eliminate motion sickness on a 1200x1800 per eye display for HD quality.<br/><br/>And yes, Mac's are very widely used for video rendering, but that rendering doesn't happen at 30+fps. It can take video rendering machines hours to render a single frame and sometimes years to render an entire movie. The final products, or pre-rendered material, is what then becomes 30+fps.<br/><br/>Thank you @TheRealFixxer<br/>Alot of what you say makes sense and some I was unaware of.<br/><br/>I guess I don't see VR as a game, but as an immersion and seeing Mac's are good at 3dcad and compiling video I would think they would be able to compile a scene well. I've even seen 3d renders of movie walk through. Creating a 3d world and placing cameras in areas to figure out how a scene would look<br/><br/>But I agree Mac's make more use of CPU cycles even by using there GPU's to help. WIth that said there are other directions one could take it. Like external thunderbolt video cards.<br/><br/>My big grip is the fact Octulas is looked at as a consumer product. If the requirements are that high, then it's more a pro product and needs to be advertized as that. I understand the technology is there but don't feel it's there to call it a consumer product.<br/><br/>Yes, you are right. Apple also has issues with software. Most aren't using "metal" the apple programming language which speeds up the processing for games because it's an Apple only solution where many use game engines that work on Microsoft Direct X or open source Opengl which most games use to run on Linux and oSX. Opengl is around 20% slower and sometime a lot more than that compared to direct x so a top of the line gaming card running in oSX runs as fast is a mid level gaming card in windows. So big problems not to mention most macs have built in cards that have no upgradability.<br/><br/>The mac pro is so different that Apple would have to do this as it wouldn't be worth a card vendor doing this as there is no profit in it for them with the small amount of possible buyers there would be for this. Apple doesn't like to loose money so I don't see this ever happening. Apple would loose money offering video card upgrades for mac pros.<br/><br/>Well he has a point though I do t care about oculus rift, rather wait for starVR. There should be an option to add better GPUs into an iMac and MacBook Pro. It is also sad that there is no more nVidia card, I liked the CUDA support now I will have to buy a PC and install Linux for my CUDA projects.<br/><br/>Gaming is a growing market and it won't be long until even iPhones have more GPU performance than the Macs. I agree that Apple should offer a high end GPU in a Mac<br/><br/>I am very bothered by the lack of high performance discrete graphics on Mac computers. Even the top of the like iMac uses an out of date mobile GPU which, of course, cannot be upgraded. If I want to develop software for VR, Apple has left me no choice but to buy or build a PC to run it on. As a big Apple fan (yes I admit it) this make me rather sad.<br/><br/>BTW, VR is not some passing fad. If you have tried it you know what I mean. VR is going to change gaming and content creation forever. My only worry about VR is that is too good. There could be millions of people that will become addicted to living and playing in virtual worlds. Look at how many people got addicted to MMOs that played on a flat screen. With VR you really feel like you are in the game.<br/><br/>Not worried about anything, i am pretty sure apple will have its own implementation for Mac and iOS when tech will be ready for consumers, right now it is more for hardcore users. Like always apple like to time its presence on right time, with right product. Have faith in apple.<br/><br/>It's funny that a lot of people know which vr is better based on os support. I guess you guys did heavy testing and now are the guy in the big electronic store that knows best.<br/><br/>HTC said it will bring support to the osx but that still needs to be seen.<br/><br/>I understand that a lot of you guys are stamped on there d**ks. But understand that Apple is more focused on laptops. And laptops can't be packed with more power than a PC, due to size, heat, power consumption etc.<br/><br/>He is right, even though he put it in **** terms. I love my Mac but Lord it needs a boost in graphics. Not that it needs to cost more but I would be more than willing to pay a little extra for a better graphics card or at least have the option to install my own. It's really too bad this guy had to make his statement sound like he is just plain uneducated. | Oculus CEO kommer ned hårdt på Mac-understøttelse til Rift<br/><br/>Oculus CEO, Palmer Luckey, har ikke hakket sine ord, da han blev spurgt i et interview, om Rift VR-headsettet nogensinde vil støtte Mac. Hvis du havde håb om, at det snart ville ske, vil du måske gøre dig klar til en vis skuffelse.<br/><br/>Det er op til Apple. Hvis de nogensinde frigiver en god computer, vil vi gøre det.<br/><br/>Hvad han henviser til der i en mindre diplomatisk forstand er den diskrete grafik, der kræves for at køre Rift. Den enkle sandhed er, at Apple bare ikke går til high-end grafik, der vil opfylde kravene til headsettet. For kontekst, på en Windows-pc, du har brug for et minimum af en NVIDIA GTX 970, en $300 grafikkort.<br/><br/>Som Luckey fortsatte med at sige:<br/><br/>Det kan bare koges ned til det faktum, at Apple ikke prioriterer high-end GPU'er. Du kan købe en $ 6.000 Mac Pro med toppen af linjen AMD FirePro D700, og det matcher stadig ikke vores anbefalede specifikationer. Så hvis de prioriterer avancerede GPU'er, som de plejede i et stykke tid, vil vi gerne støtte Mac. Men lige nu er der bare ikke en eneste maskine derude, der understøtter det.<br/><br/>Mac Pro kan ikke beskyldes for ikke at pakke masser af hestekræfter, fordi det gør det, men lige så FirePro grafik er rettet mere mod det kreative marked, ligesom Mac Pro. Især Mac Pro overgår langt andre hardwarekrav, men da Rift er grafiktung, er det her manglen er. Luckey er måske lidt over the top, men han er lige så meget manden bag Rift, så der er ingen tvivl om, at der er masser af sandhed i det, han siger, selvom han ikke siger det særlig godt.<br/><br/>Hvad siger du, Mac ejere af verden? Er du selv generet om Oculus Rift eller er det noget, du ønsker du kunne have? Lyd ud i kommentarerne nedenfor!<br/><br/>Læserkommentarer<br/><br/>Oculus CEO kommer ned hårdt på Mac-understøttelse til Rift<br/><br/>Nej, ikke generet af det, da jeg virkelig ikke havde planer om at købe en Oculus Rift. For mig er produktkategorien stadig for tidligt og for meget i en beta-kinda-fase. Men han stiger et gyldigt punkt. Apple bør forsøge at komme mere foran pakken CPU / GPU-vis. Lige nu er de altid bagud.<br/><br/>Undskyld mig, men hvad er HTC Vive bedre til? Og Oculus Rift understøtter helt sikkert Linux-maskiner, der opfylder deres hardwarespecifikationer! (Problemet er ikke OS, men hardware.)<br/><br/>Se også på HVORFOR HTC Vive understøtter OS X: det indeholder mere af sin egen hardware. (Derfor koster det så meget.) Oculus-løsningerne - både Rift og Samsung Gear VR - kræver den hardware, som den tilslutter til at udføre mere af det tunge løft.<br/><br/>VR er ikke en gimmick. 3D-tv'er giver ikke altid så meget af en 3d-effekt, og det virker ikke med alle. VR arbejder med alle, og Oculus og HTC Vive officielle udgivelsesprodukter har næsten ingen ventetid, så der skal ikke være nogen køresyge. Der er også masser af spil support<br/><br/>Det er klart, at hvis spil er en prioritet, er du generelt ikke på markedet for en Mac. Ikke mange spiludviklere understøtter OSX, så disse typer enheder har sandsynligvis begrænset brug på en Mac (til spil, som Rift var designet til). Det er i hvert fald den eneste grund til, at jeg kunne se mig selv bruge en.<br/><br/>Apple implementerede Metal-motoren i El Capitan, der kan være nogle planer om at gå ind på spilmarkedet (som Apple lærte fra iOS, hvor stort dette marked er, bare se på de øverste brutto apps).<br/>Så nu mangler hardwaren, og og game devs ville sandsynligvis vise en vis interesse, da Macs er der nu en acceptabel mængde Mac-brugere rundt om i verden.<br/><br/>Jeg vil gerne se Apple gøre sin vej ind i denne sektor af branchen. Jeg bruger ikke nogen Apple-produkter i øjeblikket, men de gør mange af de rigtige træk på mange områder, og jeg er meget fascineret.<br/><br/>Plus, konkurrence brændstoffer innovation. Jeg ved, at store computer del fremstiller allerede skabe, at konkurrence, men Apple har RnD viljestyrke og kontanter til virkelig slå hoveder. De kan ikke vinde numrene spil i form af specs, de faktisk sjældent gør, men de fleste mennesker, der plejer at gøre forskningen ved, at ydeevne! = summen af enhedens dele. Apple kan gøre mere med "mindre". På papiret deres produkter synes ringere, men når omhyggeligt afbalanceret hardware opfylder specifikt konstrueret software de generelt udfører lige så godt som konkurrenterne, hvis ikke ud udføre.<br/><br/>HA! Jeg elsker, hvordan det pludselig ikke er vigtigt at have en højtydende computer for Apple-fans! Der er ikke en eneste Mac, der er i stand til den højeste ende grafik. Kan ikke købe en, kan ikke bygge en. Mac er ikke i stand til at være den højeste i ydeevne, og du er god med det. HA! Classic!<br/><br/>Jeg købte min MacBook Pro Retina i 2012 på grund af den høje opløsningsskærm og den ikke-diskrete GPU. Men til mit skrivebord byggede jeg et system med en 4K-skærm, i7 4790K CPU, 3 GTX 970 GPU'er og 16 gb hukommelse alt for mindre end hvad jeg ville betale for en iMac. Jeg har endda en SSD sat op til at starte i OSX. Min pointe er Apple kunne gøre lignende ting, hvis det ønskede, men gør det ikke. Faktisk, se på den nyeste iMac. Det omfatter diskret grafik og en langsom 5400 RPM-drev. Min computer ser måske ikke så smuk ud, og den er ikke så tynd, men i sidste ende er det mere nyttigt - er det ikke derfor, vi køber en computer i første omgang?<br/><br/>Jeg kan ikke se, hvorfor en Mac pro ikke kan gøre brug af Oculus er det ikke bygget til rendering video. Jeg forstår, at det ikke vil være i stand til at køre på iMac's og på grund af dette Oculus bør være mærkevarer for Pro-brugere på grund af kravene og kommer til prisen.<br/><br/>Nu siger folk, at din computer gør ALLE de tunge løft, så hvorfor er prisen punkt over $ 800 for noget, der ikke gør noget?<br/><br/>Jeg er spændt på retningen af VR, men ikke hvor det er i øjeblikket.<br/><br/>Din skærm (som Rift er) gør aldrig nogen af de tunge løft. Det er $ 800 på grund af, hvad skærmen gør; 110° visningsvinkel (stadig ikke det menneskelige øje, men meget tættere end andre skærme) med super lav latens for at reducere eller eliminere køresyge på en 1200x1800 pr. Øjeskærm for HD-kvalitet.<br/><br/>Og ja, Mac's er meget udbredt til videogengivelse, men den gengivelse sker ikke ved 30 + fps. Det kan tage videogengivelsesmaskiner timer at gøre en enkelt ramme og nogle gange år at gøre en hel film. De endelige produkter, eller præ-renderet materiale, er, hvad der derefter bliver 30 + fps.<br/><br/>Tak for din vurdering.<br/>Meget af det, du siger, giver mening, og noget, jeg ikke var klar over.<br/><br/>Jeg tror ikke, jeg ser VR som et spil, men som en nedsænkning og se Mac's er gode til 3dcad og kompilering af video, ville jeg tro, at de ville være i stand til at kompilere en scene godt. Jeg har endda set 3d-gengivelser af film gå igennem. Oprettelse af en 3D-verden og placering af kameraer i områder for at finde ud af, hvordan en scene ville se ud<br/><br/>Men jeg er enig i, at Mac's gør mere brug af CPU-cyklusser, selv ved at bruge der GPU'er til at hjælpe. Med det sagt er der andre retninger, man kunne tage det. Ligesom eksterne tordenbolt-videokort.<br/><br/>Mit store greb er, at Octulas betragtes som et forbrugerprodukt. Hvis kravene er så høje, så er det mere et pro-produkt og skal annonceres som det. Jeg forstår, at teknologien er der, men føler ikke, at den er der for at kalde det et forbrugerprodukt.<br/><br/>Ja, du har ret. Apple har også problemer med software. De fleste bruger ikke "metal" apple programmeringssprog, som fremskynder behandlingen af spil, fordi det er en Apple eneste løsning, hvor mange bruger spilmotorer, der arbejder på Microsoft Direct X eller open source Opengl, som de fleste spil bruger til at køre på Linux og osX. Opengl er omkring 20% langsommere og engang meget mere end det i forhold til direkte x så en top of the line gaming kort kører i oSX kører så hurtigt er en mid level gaming kort i windows. Så store problemer for ikke at nævne de fleste Macs har bygget i kort, der ikke har nogen upgradability.<br/><br/>Mac Pro er så anderledes, at Apple ville have til at gøre dette, da det ikke ville være værd at en kort sælger gør dette, da der ikke er nogen fortjeneste i det for dem med den lille mængde af mulige købere, der ville være for dette. Apple kan ikke lide at miste penge, så jeg kan ikke se, at dette nogensinde sker. Apple ville miste penge, der tilbyder videokortopgraderinger til mac-professionelle.<br/><br/>Nå har han et punkt, selvom jeg ikke bekymrer mig om oculus rift, snarere vente på starVR. Der bør være en mulighed for at tilføje bedre GPU'er til en iMac og MacBook Pro. Det er også trist, at der ikke er mere nVidia-kort, jeg kunne godt lide CUDA-understøttelsen nu skal jeg købe en pc og installere Linux til mine CUDA-projekter.<br/><br/>Gaming er et voksende marked, og det vil ikke vare længe, før selv iPhones har mere GPU-ydeevne end Mac'erne. Jeg er enig i, at Apple skal tilbyde en high end GPU i en Mac<br/><br/>Jeg er meget generet af manglen på højtydende diskret grafik på Mac-computere. Selv toppen af iMac bruger en forældet mobil GPU, som selvfølgelig ikke kan opgraderes. Hvis jeg vil udvikle software til VR, har Apple ikke givet mig andet valg end at købe eller bygge en pc til at køre den på. Som en stor Apple-fan (ja jeg indrømmer det) gør det mig ret trist.<br/><br/>BTW, VR er ikke en forbipasserende fad. Hvis du har prøvet det, ved du, hvad jeg mener. VR vil ændre spil og indholdsoprettelse for evigt. Min eneste bekymring om VR er, at det er for godt. Der kan være millioner af mennesker, der vil blive afhængige af at leve og spille i virtuelle verdener. Se på, hvor mange mennesker blev afhængige af MMO'er, der spillede på en flad skærm. Med VR føler du virkelig, at du er i spillet.<br/><br/>Ikke bekymret for noget, jeg er ret sikker på, at Apple vil have sin egen implementering til Mac og iOS, når teknologien vil være klar til forbrugerne, lige nu er det mere for hardcore brugere. Som altid æble gerne tid sin tilstedeværelse på det rigtige tidspunkt, med rigtige produkt. Har tillid til æble.<br/><br/>Det er sjovt, at mange mennesker ved, hvilken vr er bedre baseret på os support. Jeg gætter på, at I gjorde tunge test og nu er fyren i den store elektroniske butik, der ved bedst.<br/><br/>HTC sagde, at det vil bringe støtte til osx, men det skal stadig ses.<br/><br/>Jeg forstår, at mange af jer er stemplet på d ** ks. Men forstå, at Apple er mere fokuseret på bærbare computere. Og bærbare computere kan ikke pakkes med mere strøm end en pc på grund af størrelse, varme, strømforbrug osv.<br/><br/>Han har ret, selvom han satte det i **** vilkår. Jeg elsker min Mac, men Lord det har brug for et løft i grafik. Ikke at det skal koste mere, men jeg ville være mere end villig til at betale lidt ekstra for et bedre grafikkort eller i det mindste have mulighed for at installere min egen. Det er virkelig synd, at denne fyr var nødt til at få sin erklæring til at lyde som om han bare er uuddannet. |
| The Masjid in the American Landscape: Civic Rights<br/><br/>Twelfth graders examine and explain legal rights designed to protect religious liberty. They evaluate the extent to which the First Amendment protects religious practices. They research and describe current and past legal battles over religious zoning and buildings. They discuss whether restrictions should be placed on where religious buildings are built.<br/><br/>What Members Say<br/><br/>As an online high school teacher, LP has helped me tremendously with extra resources! I have been able to use additional supplemental materials from here and students are able to gain more knowledge and a different perspective. | Masjid i det amerikanske landskab: Civic Rights<br/><br/>Tolvte gradere undersøger og forklarer juridiske rettigheder, der er designet til at beskytte religiøs frihed. De vurderer, i hvilket omfang den første ændring beskytter religiøs praksis. De undersøger og beskriver aktuelle og tidligere juridiske kampe om religiøs zoneinddeling og bygninger. De diskuterer, om der skal lægges begrænsninger på, hvor religiøse bygninger er bygget.<br/><br/>Hvad siger medlemmerne<br/><br/>Som en online gymnasielærer har LP hjulpet mig enormt med ekstra ressourcer! Jeg har været i stand til at bruge yderligere supplerende materialer herfra, og eleverne er i stand til at få mere viden og et andet perspektiv. |
| What Guys Said 19<br/><br/>No, it is because entertainment producers and product marketers want actors/actresses and models who look like the majority of the audience, so that they are relatable and therefore more effective sales tools. I am sure that Asian women look wonderful to Asian men. To me, as a white man, they have zero appeal.<br/><br/>@cowboy101 I am 100 per cent straight. I do not go outside of my race. When I was a soldier I had the "me love you long time" experience in Asia. That has left me feeling uncomfortable whenever there are Asian females near me. Sometimes I become profoundly uncomfortable, even though the particular individuals have done nothing to merit it. During a visit to Thailand, I found that the only way to prevent myself being propositioned on the street was to take white a female with me as a minder.<br/><br/>Aha the thing is that there isn't many white people (or any at all) in China, but in 'white' places, (or at least Australia) there are quite a lot of Asians around there, which made me think about this question...<br/><br/>Maybe in parts of the country where you stick at (remember, birds of a feather...), just like to republicans it seems that most people are republican etc. While it can only be small minority that you are surrounded by.<br/><br/>And as far as I know, there are a lot of whites in china, mainly by business, etc. But it's simple, most of people there are Asian, so they prefere Asian girls (dogs like dogs , cats like cats, most people prefere their own kind). And there is nothing wrong with that. Same is in white countries.<br/><br/>I think Asians are the most beautful. Unfortunately for me the 2 I got involved with in my life one was using me for my place/internet a long time ago and the recent one was a gold digging stupid bitch. She never graduated college and was 30. I would be extremely happy if I met a smart cute Asian woman near my age that was not a gold digger.<br/><br/>@Prettyapathetic yes because when a man loves deeply he always good with you on bed no matter size of tits or colour of skin and a real man always respect a girl in every relation like mother, sister, wife, girlfriend etc<br/><br/>as a model from childhood I got my start with a company called sugar & spice. I was recruited in Japan while my family was stationed there.<br/><br/>you get a job because they are going for a certain look, who are they targeting, and the area you live in.<br/><br/>I had to leave the industry last year because of health reasons. I worked with with many types of people, korean, Japanese, chinese, polish, german, American, Spanish, arabic. I've worked with children, adults, teenagers all of these ethnicities.<br/><br/>I am half white half Native American (Lakota) so they loved my look from a young age. but there are many beauty standards in the industry and not all of them are as portrayed, some being made to look worse, and some not taken seriously enough...<br/><br/>Nope, it's because the Asian men are jealous and angry and invent thousands of excuses every rare time who have Asian women in the media because they are jealous of Asian women, and Americans want to keep the status of white women, this is why the couples between Asian women and white men are boycotted and all other race with white women are pushed, it's white women wiht white men and white women with other races in American media, since it's opression and offensive for the ego of men of other race the women of own race with white but white women with other race is "anti-racism". You need to understand the American political social engineering all over these years of media, democrats, politics and propaganda.<br/><br/>Anyway, in countries like china, japan, korea they have Asian men and Asian women only and the only exceptions are when they import a white women to make some fantasy scene for them but it's not so much, it's forbiden expose the hatred and jealousy of some Asian men.<br/><br/>The Asian boys will be happy if you say something against other men, but they will be angry if you say that the Asian girl will die for the blond girl date the handsome caucasian/white dude, they will try to force Asian women to make anything against these men to these small vocal group of Asian men feel better in their hatred, excuses, racism and jealousy. This is why Asian women is not showed so much, it's because the Asian men will be angry, it's because the white women can't be replaced, and the American propaganda is around white women with white men, white women with other race, white women against white men for the other race of men, white women in everything.<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>1&#124;0<br/><br/>0&#124;0<br/><br/>Opinion Owner<br/><br/>1mo<br/><br/>All the excuses of media and propaganda and all lies for racism, jealousy and hate aren't used against white women by the same men who invent the excuses, white women all the time in the media, understand, the American social engineering is made by democrats, democrats hate white men, and the most popular couples would be white men and Asian women but it's horrible for a few group of white racists who are racists even against Asians, is bad for the angry Asian men and their excuses, is bad for the white women, the democrats really don't like white men and work hard to try to make the couple and anything wiht white men and non-white women be related to bad things while pushing white women and non-white men. It's a American political problem.<br/><br/>I think it's a opression against the ego of the men of other race, so the white guys need to look bad, be some sort of jokes, be soft, while the scenes with white women and other race is the opposite of the scenes of white men and non-white women | Hvad mænd siger 19<br/><br/>Nej, det er fordi underholdningsproducenter og produktmarkedsførere ønsker skuespillere/skuespillere og modeller, der ligner størstedelen af publikum, så de er relatable og derfor mere effektive salgsværktøjer. Jeg er sikker på, at asiatiske kvinder ser vidunderlige ud til asiatiske mænd. For mig som en hvid mand har de nul appel.<br/><br/>@cowboy101 Jeg er 100 procent lige. Jeg går ikke uden for min race. Da jeg var soldat, havde jeg "mig elsker dig lang tid" -oplevelsen i Asien. Det har fået mig til at føle mig ubehagelig, når der er asiatiske kvinder i nærheden af mig. Nogle gange bliver jeg dybt ubehagelig, selvom de enkelte personer ikke har gjort noget for at fortjene det. Under et besøg i Thailand fandt jeg ud af, at den eneste måde at forhindre mig i at blive stillet på gaden var at tage hvid en kvinde med mig som en minder.<br/><br/>Aha ting er, at der ikke er mange hvide mennesker (eller nogen overhovedet) i Kina, men i 'hvide' steder, (eller i det mindste Australien) er der en hel del asiater omkring der, som fik mig til at tænke på dette spørgsmål...<br/><br/>Måske i dele af landet, hvor du holder på (husk, fugle af en fjer...), ligesom republikanere ser det ud til, at de fleste mennesker er republikanske osv. Mens det kun kan være lille mindretal, som du er omgivet af.<br/><br/>Og så vidt jeg ved, er der mange hvide i Kina, hovedsageligt ved forretning osv. Men det er simpelt, de fleste mennesker er der asiatiske, så de foretrækker asiatiske piger (hunde som hunde, katte som katte, de fleste mennesker foretrækker deres egen slags). Og det er der ikke noget galt i. Det samme er i hvide lande.<br/><br/>Jeg tror, asiater er de mest smukke. Desværre for mig 2 jeg blev involveret med i mit liv en var ved hjælp af mig for mit sted / internet for længe siden, og den seneste var en guldgravende dum tæve. Hun aldrig dimitterede college og var 30. Jeg ville være meget glad, hvis jeg mødte en smart sød asiatisk kvinde nær min alder, der ikke var en guldgraver.<br/><br/>@Prettyapathetic ja fordi når en mand elsker dybt han altid godt med dig på sengen uanset størrelse patter eller hudfarve og en rigtig mand altid respektere en pige i alle forhold som mor, søster, kone, kæreste osv<br/><br/>Som model fra barndommen startede jeg med et firma kaldet sugar & spice. Jeg blev rekrutteret i Japan, mens min familie var udstationeret der.<br/><br/>Du får et job, fordi de går efter et bestemt udseende, hvem de målretter mod, og det område, du bor i.<br/><br/>Jeg var nødt til at forlade branchen sidste år på grund af sundhedsmæssige årsager. Jeg arbejdede med mange typer mennesker, koreansk, japansk, kinesisk, polsk, tysk, amerikansk, spansk, arabisk. Jeg har arbejdet med børn, voksne, teenagere alle disse etniciteter.<br/><br/>Jeg er halvt hvid halv indianer (Lakota), så de elskede mit udseende fra en ung alder. men der er mange skønhedsstandarder i branchen, og ikke alle er som portrætteret, nogle bliver gjort til at se værre ud, og nogle ikke taget alvorligt nok ...<br/><br/>Nej, det er fordi de asiatiske mænd er jaloux og vred og opfinde tusindvis af undskyldninger hver sjælden gang, der har asiatiske kvinder i medierne, fordi de er jaloux på asiatiske kvinder, og amerikanerne ønsker at holde status af hvide kvinder, det er derfor par mellem asiatiske kvinder og hvide mænd er boykottet og alle andre race med hvide kvinder er skubbet, det er hvide kvinder med hvide mænd og hvide kvinder med andre racer i amerikanske medier, da det er opression Du er nødt til at forstå den amerikanske politiske social engineering over alle disse år af medier, demokrater, politik og propaganda.<br/><br/>Anyway, i lande som Kina, Japan, Korea de har kun asiatiske mænd og asiatiske kvinder og de eneste undtagelser er, når de importerer en hvid kvinder til at gøre nogle fantasi scene for dem, men det er ikke så meget, det er forbudt udsætte had og jalousi af nogle asiatiske mænd.<br/><br/>De asiatiske drenge vil være glade, hvis du siger noget mod andre mænd, men de vil være vrede, hvis du siger, at den asiatiske pige vil dø for den blonde pige dato den smukke kaukasiske / hvide fyr, de vil forsøge at tvinge asiatiske kvinder til at gøre noget mod disse mænd til disse små vokal gruppe af asiatiske mænd føler sig bedre i deres had, undskyldninger, racisme og jalousi. Det er derfor, asiatiske kvinder ikke vises så meget, det er fordi de asiatiske mænd vil være vrede, det er fordi de hvide kvinder ikke kan erstattes, og den amerikanske propaganda er omkring hvide kvinder med hvide mænd, hvide kvinder med anden race, hvide kvinder mod hvide mænd for den anden race af mænd, hvide kvinder i alt.<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>1-0<br/><br/>0-0<br/><br/>Opinion Ejer<br/><br/>1mo<br/><br/>Alle undskyldninger for medier og propaganda og alle løgne for racisme, jalousi og had bruges ikke mod hvide kvinder af de samme mænd, der opfinder undskyldningerne, hvide kvinder hele tiden i medierne, forstår, den amerikanske social engineering er lavet af demokrater, demokrater hader hvide mænd, og de mest populære par ville være hvide mænd og asiatiske kvinder, men det er forfærdeligt for nogle få hvide racister, der er hårde mænd selv mod asiater, er for de dårlige mænd. Det er et amerikansk politisk problem.<br/><br/>Jeg tror, det er et udtryk mod egoet hos mænd af anden race, så de hvide fyre skal se dårlige ud, være en slags vittigheder, være bløde, mens scenerne med hvide kvinder og anden race er det modsatte af scenerne af hvide mænd og ikke-hvide kvinder |
