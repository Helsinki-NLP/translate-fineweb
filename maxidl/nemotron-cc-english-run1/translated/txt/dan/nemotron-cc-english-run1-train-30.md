Undocumented migrants have nothing. They are not allowed to work. They have no right to state benefits nor to a place to live. They are unseen and potentially the most vulnerable group in the UK today.<br/><br/>Undocumented (or irregular) migrants include those trafficked into the sex trade or for domestic servitude; they include visa overstayers; those whose asylum applications have been refused and others who have been subject to failures in the immigration system. All of these may originally have come to the UK legally.<br/><br/>'Illegal immigrants' – those imagined to have entered the country in the backs of lorries – make up a small proportion of the undocumented.<br/><br/>Indeed some sources suggest that half the estimated 120,000 undocumented children in the UK were actually born here to undocumented parents. These children are disadvantaged from birth, solely by their immigration status.<br/><br/>The blog tells the stories of the undocumented. It highlights their daily struggles and vulnerabilities, but also their strength and resilience. It's not an easy read.<br/><br/>You can access the blog via our website (bottom of right hand column on Home Page).<br/><br/>The blog has won the online category of the Speaking Together media awards. The awards were a new addition this year to the Migrant and Refugee Woman of the Year Awards celebration at the Royal Festival Hall in London as part of International Women's Day. The panel of judges – including novelist and playwright Gillian Slovo, and journalist and author, Hannah Pool – was particularly looking for work that challenged myths and stereotypes.<br/><br/>The blog has also won the Blog North Awards 2013 in the Best Writing category and was also shortlisted for an Amnesty International Media Award. | Indlægsnavigation<br/><br/>"Life Without Papers" vinder prisen som bedste forfatter<br/><br/>Blogprojektet, "Life Without Papers", skabt af Len Grant, indeholder historier om papirløse indvandrerfamilier og unge. Papirløse indvandrere har intet. De har ikke lov til at arbejde. De har ingen ret til statslige ydelser eller til et sted at bo. De er usynlige og potentielt den mest sårbare gruppe i Storbritannien i dag.<br/><br/>Udokumenterede (eller irregulære) migranter omfatter dem, der handles ind i sexhandelen eller for indenlandsk trældom; de omfatter visumoverskridere; dem, hvis asylansøgninger er blevet afvist, og andre, der har været udsat for fejl i indvandringssystemet. Alle disse kan oprindeligt være kommet til Storbritannien lovligt.<br/><br/>"Ulovlige indvandrere" - dem, der forestiller sig at være kommet ind i landet i ryggen på lastbiler - udgør en lille del af de udokumenterede.<br/><br/>Faktisk nogle kilder tyder på, at halvdelen af de anslåede 120.000 udokumenterede børn i Storbritannien faktisk blev født her til udokumenterede forældre. Disse børn er dårligt stillede fra fødslen, udelukkende af deres indvandring status.<br/><br/>Bloggen fortæller historierne om de udokumenterede. Den fremhæver deres daglige kampe og sårbarheder, men også deres styrke og modstandsdygtighed. Det er ikke en nem læsning.<br/><br/>Du kan få adgang til bloggen via vores hjemmeside (nederst i højre kolonne på hjemmesiden).<br/><br/>Bloggen har vundet online kategorien af Speaking Together mediepriser. Priserne var en ny tilføjelse i år til Migrant and Refugee Woman of the Year Awards-festen på Royal Festival Hall i London som en del af den internationale kvindedag. Panelet af dommere - herunder romanforfatter og dramatiker Gillian Slovo, og journalist og forfatter, Hannah Pool - var især på udkig efter arbejde, der udfordrede myter og stereotyper.<br/><br/>Bloggen har også vundet Blog North Awards 2013 i kategorien Best Writing og blev også nomineret til en Amnesty International Media Award. |
| Sabbath School Lesson<br/><br/>In Galatians, Paul tackles issues such as freedom, the role of the law in salvation, our condition in Christ, and the nature of the Spirit-led life, as well as the age-old question, How can sinful humans be made right before a holy and just God?<br/><br/>Many scholars believe that Galatians may be the earliest of Paul's letters. It was written in A.D. 49, shortly after the famous Jerusalem Council (Acts 15). Therefore, the book may be the oldest Christian document known. As Acts and Galatians make clear, the early church found itself in a fierce battle over the nature of salvation, especially in the case of Gentiles. According to a group of Jewish believers, known as Judaizers, belief in Jesus alone was not good enough for Gentiles. Gentiles must also be circumcised and follow the laws of Moses (Acts 15:1).<br/><br/>This quarter's Bible study guide invites us to journey with the apostle Paul as he pleads with the Galatians to remain true to Jesus. It also gives us a chance to reflect on our own understanding of the truths that opened the way for Martin Luther's ultimate break with Rome and the restoration of the biblical gospel. | Sabbath School lektion<br/><br/>I Galaterbrevet tager Paulus fat på emner som frihed, lovens rolle i frelsen, vores tilstand i Kristus og det åndsstyrede livs natur, såvel som det ældgamle spørgsmål: Hvordan kan syndige mennesker gøres retfærdige over for en hellig og retfærdig Gud?<br/><br/>Mange forskere mener, at Galaterbrevet kan være det tidligste af Paulus' breve. Det blev skrevet i år 49 e.Kr., kort efter det berømte råd i Jerusalem (ApG 15). Derfor kan bogen være det ældste kristne dokument, der kendes. Som Apostlenes Gerninger og Galaterne gør det klart, befandt den tidlige kirke sig i en hård kamp om frelsens natur, især i tilfælde af ikke-jøder. Ifølge en gruppe af jødiske troende, kendt som Judaizers, tro på Jesus alene var ikke godt nok for hedninger. Hedninger skal også omskæres og følge Moselovene (ApG 15:1).<br/><br/>Dette kvartals bibelstudieguide inviterer os til at rejse med apostelen Paulus, da han bønfalder galaterne om at forblive tro mod Jesus. Det giver os også en chance for at reflektere over vores egen forståelse af de sandheder, der åbnede vejen for Martin Luthers ultimative brud med Rom og genoprettelsen af det bibelske evangelium. |

Hun var ældste barn og datter af Karl 2., storhertug af Mecklenburg, Charlotte og hendes søstre, dronning Louise af Preussen, dronning Frederica af Hannover og prinsesse Therese af Thurn und Taxis, blev betragtet som de smukkeste kvinder i deres tid. Jean Paul Friedrich Richter dedikerede sin roman Titan til de fire smukke, Charlotte voksede op i Hannover, hvor hendes far fungerede som guvernør, på vegne af sin svoger, kong George III af Storbritannien, der boede i London. Da Charlotte var tolv år gammel, døde hendes mor, og hun blev opdraget af sin mors søster, Charlotte, der giftede sig med sin far i 1784, og hendes søstre blev bragt af hendes bedstemor, Maria Louise Albertine af Leiningen-Falkenburg-Dagsburg i Darmstadt. Den 3. september 1785, i en alder af femten, giftede Charlotte sig med hertug Frederik, hertug af Sachsen-Altenburg, ægteskabet var ikke en lykkelig en, Charlotte var mentalt overlegen til Frederik, som begyndte at ignorere hende. De havde også problemer, Saxe-Hildburghausen var blevet økonomisk ødelagt af den katastrofale politik Fredericks forgængere. Modtagerne tillod hertugen og hertuginden kun en reduceret civilliste, Charlottes far og to brødre boede ofte hos Charlotte i Hildburghausen.

I 1793 vendte Charlottes bedstemor tilbage fra eksil og rejste med Charlottes søstre til Frankfurt am Main, Charlotte havde et meget intimt og kærligt forhold til sin søster Friederike og slægtninge i Strelitz. I 1803 og 1805 besøgte det preussiske kongepar Hildburghausen, for denne lejlighed tillod modtagerne hertugparret at forny nogle af deres møbler. Louise havde været med til at udarbejde krigserklæringen, christian Truchse – von Wetzhausen zu Bettenburg var ven med hertugparret og gudfar til Charlottes søn Edward. Mange tilskuere var kommet for at se den bayerske kronprinsesse, da han modtog sine gæster, Truchse – forsøgte at føre den lavere rangerende Charlotte først ind på sit slot, men hun nægtede, med henvisning til hendes datter. "Deres Højhed vil tilgive mig," svarede Truchse, "men så længe dette slot har stået her, greb Therese baronerne den anden arm, og de tre gik gennem porten sammen." Hertuginden gav omkring halvdelen af sin indkomst til de fattige, pensionister.<br/><br/>1617.<br/>Prins Charles af Hessen-Kassel<br/>–<br/>Prins Charles af Hessen-Kassel var kadetmedlem af huset Hessen-Kassel og en dansk generalfeltmarskal. Opvokset hos slægtninge ved det danske hof tilbragte han det meste af sit liv i Danmark og hans mor var en datter af kong Georg 2. af Storbritannien og Caroline af Ansbach og en søster til dronning Louise af Danmark. Hans far, den fremtidige landgreve, forlod familien i 1747, i 1755 afsluttede han formelt ægteskabet med Maria.

I 1756 flyttede Maria til Danmark for at passe de mindreårige børn af sin søster, dronning Louise af Danmark. Med sig tog hun sine sønner, der var opvokset ved hoffet på Christiansborg Slot i København. De hessiske fyrster forblev senere i Danmark og blev dets vigtige herrer, kun den ældste bror Vilhelm vendte tilbage til Hessen i 1785, da han besteg landgraviaten. Charles begyndte en karriere i Danmark. I 1758 blev han udnævnt til oberst, i en alder af 20 generalmajor, også i 1766, blev han udnævnt til generalguvernør i Norge, en stilling han havde til 1768, men som forblev for det meste titulær, da han aldrig rejste til Norge i denne periode. I 1763 giftede hans ældre bror William sig med deres fætter, Charles fulgte efter den 30. august 1766 på Christiansborg Slot - hans kone var Louise af Danmark, og Charles blev dermed svoger til sin fætter, kong Christian VII. Brylluppet fandt sted på trods af råd givet imod det, på grund af beskyldninger om udskejelser fra prins Charles. Kort efter faldt Charles i unåde ved hoffet, og i begyndelsen af 1767 ville han og de få deres første barn, Marie Sophie, der i 1767 og derefter deres andet barn, William, i 1769. I 1768 købte Charles ejendommen og landsbyen Offenbach-Rumpenheim fra Edelsheim-familien.

Han arvede sine fædres embeder omkring 1020, og fortsatte med at øge sine ejendomme i det nordlige Italien i 1069-1070, han forsøgte at erhverve Maine for sin søn Hugh, fordi hans kone, Garsende, var en medarving af de tidligere grever af Maine. Hugh blev erklæret greve, men han kunne ikke sejre mod Robert, hertugen af Normandiet, i Investiturstriden mellem Henrik 4., tysk-romersk kejser, og pave Gregor 7., Azzo forsøgte at mægle, men senere sluttede han sig til pavens side. Omkring 1073 lavede han et slot på Este sin bopæl, hvorfra huset Este, før hans byggeprojekt, Este var lidt mere end en landsby. Hans søn Welf flyttede først til Kärnten og derefter til Bayern, hvilket gav anledning til en af de vigtigste familier i europæisk historie, en anden søn, Fulk I af Milano, gjorde den første dokumenterede brug af titlen Marquis dEste.

Henrik erklærede som følge af gentagne oprørshandlinger Welf afsat i sit nyerhvervede hertugdømme. Men støttet af hans trofaste bayere, og hjulpet af sin far i Italien, Welf var i stand til at opretholde sin plads, dog Gregory døde i 1085 og hans efterfølgere tog en mindre intensiv del i anliggender Tyskland. Welf, men stadig tilslutter sig partiet i kirken, efter skilsmissen, i 1070, fra sin første kone, Welf gift Judith af Flandern, datter af Baldwin IV, greve af Flandern, og enken af Tostig Godwinson, jarl af Northumbria. I 1089 giftede Welfs søn Welf sig med Matilda af Toscana, og dermed styrkede forholdet til paven, men efter at den yngre Welf blev skilt fra Matilda i 1095, gjorde Welf bod hos kong Henrik 4. og blev genbekræftet i sin stilling som hertug af Bayern. Efter sin far Azzos død i 1097 forsøgte Welf at erhverve sin fars ejendom syd for Alperne, og i 1099 sluttede Welf sig til det, der senere blev kendt som korstoget i 1101, sammen med Vilhelm 9. af Aquitaine, Hugh af Vermandois og Ida af Østrig.

| Follow Us<br/><br/>ARE YOU AN<br/><br/>INSIDER<br/><br/>Craving Sugar? Here's What Your Body Is Trying to Tell You<br/><br/>by<br/>Byrdie<br/><br/>PHOTO:<br/><br/>Jacquemus<br/><br/>Weight gain from out-of-control cravings aside, it can be frustrating to have a constant hankering for something unhealthy and not know why. The good news is that there's usually a reason underlying that burning desire to house a bag of potato chips, or the feeling that you might actually die if you don't get a pickle rightthisinstant (even though you're not pregnant). If you're having visions of Milky Way bars, for example, it could mean that you're missing a very specific nutrient in your diet. (Yup—it's more complicated than said chocolate bar being so darn delicious.)<br/><br/>We talked to Los Angeles–based dietitian Shira Lenchewski, M.S., R.D., to get the skinny on some common food cravings, as well as what you can do to satiate the hunger without going overboard. Keep scrolling for some seriously good information!<br/><br/>If you're craving chocolate<br/><br/>It means: You could be lacking magnesium in your diet, says Lenchewski. "Magnesium is an essential mineral involved in energy production, glucose metabolism, and muscle function. This is especially true for those hitting the gym hard," she explains. Additionally, magnesium levels lower during the pre-menstrual weeks of your period, which explains why PMS so often comes with chocolate cravings.<br/><br/>Instead, reach for high-quality, low-sugar dark chocolate, which is naturally high in magnesium. "I recommend sticking to 75 per cent cocoa or higher, and pairing it with another magnesium-rich source like sunflower seeds," says Lenchewski. She suggests the chocolate brand Hu, a small-batch food company that focuses on high-quality ingredients produced locally. "It's a little pricey, but all the more reason to keep portions in check," she says. "It's my personal favourite." We're also big fans of superfood-packed Zenbunni.<br/><br/>If you're craving candy<br/><br/>It means: "Craving pure sugar is a good indication that you're running low on energy," says Lenchewski. "Think about it. What is the one thing you're itching for after a terrible night's sleep or at around 4 p.m. during a stressful workday? The answer is usually sugar because it's used as instant fuel for our body's cells."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for apples with nut butter. "If you're raiding your co-workers' candy stash, I recommend a more slow-burn carbohydrate with a source of fat or protein," says Lenchewski. "Unlike simple sugar, this will fuel your cells while avoiding the post-sugar crash. Two options that make for great pick-me-ups the next time you're craving candy: a sliced apple with your choice of nut butter, or berries with 2% unsweetened Greek yoghurt." We like quashing a sweet tooth with these addictive coconut chips, too—they're filling, free of any added sugar, and just so good.<br/><br/>If you're craving salt<br/><br/>It means: "If nothing but the saltiest pickle will do, you may not be drinking enough H2O," says Lenchewski. "Salt helps the body hold on to water, so we crave it when we're in need of fluids."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for water. "Stay hydrated, especially as we approach the summer months," she says. The next time a craving hits, try quenching it (literally) with a few refreshing glasses and you might find the urgency to sodium binge disappears. "If plain water bores you, try adding in mint, lemon, or frozen fruit to mix it up," says Lenchewski. And if that still doesn't do the trick, there's a healthier alternative to bagged chips or fries. "If you're really just craving salt after all, toasted seaweed is a great low-calorie option," she says.<br/><br/>If you're craving starchy carbs like pasta<br/><br/>It means: "Because high-carb foods boost the feel-good hormone serotonin, starch cravings can be a sign you're in need of a mood booster," says Lenchewski.<br/><br/>Instead, reach for a bath! "Bust out the Epsom salts, because it's time for some serious R+R," says Lenchewski. "Trust me. Indulging in a starch free-for-all feels really good in the moment, but it will likely bum you out more the next day." (As anyone who has ever over-indulged a pizza or pasta craving knows.) So the next time you want to dive head first into a bowl of carbs, draw a bath, light a candle, and treat yourself without any regret or dense calories.<br/><br/>If you're craving ice cream<br/><br/>5 / 6<br/><br/>It means: "Your body may be telling you it's in need of some healthy fat."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for coconut ice cream. "I'm a realist, so if you're craving ice cream, I'm not going to recommend a handful of walnuts, which are, of course, full of healthy fat," says Lenchewski. "For ice cream emergencies, I recommend lower-in-sugar coconut ice-creams like Coconut Bliss or Kippy's three-ingredient ice cream in Los Angeles." We can vouch for the fact that coconut ice cream tastes incredible and just like the real thing.<br/><br/>If you're craving a burger<br/><br/>It means: You need iron. "If you can't stop thinking about red meat, there's a chance your body is craving iron, b12 and folic acid," says Lenchewski. "This is especially true during or around that time of the month."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for a healthier burger. "I'm a proponent of grass fed, antibiotic and hormone-free red meat once a week," says Lenchewski. "Try experimenting with an open-faced bison burger—which, cut for cut, is leaner and has more iron than beef." Don't eat meat? Try to incorporate some kind of plant-based iron supplement into your routine, like spirulina. | Følg os på<br/><br/>ER DU EN<br/><br/>INSIDER<br/><br/>Craving Sugar? Her er hvad din krop forsøger at fortælle dig<br/><br/>ved<br/>Byrdie<br/><br/>FOTO:<br/><br/>Jacquemus<br/><br/>Vægtøgning fra out-of-control cravings til side, kan det være frustrerende at have en konstant hankering for noget usundt og ikke ved hvorfor. Den gode nyhed er, at der normalt er en grund til, at brændende ønske om at huse en pose kartoffelchips, eller følelsen af, at du rent faktisk kan dø, hvis du ikke får en pickle rightthisinstant (selvom du ikke er gravid). Hvis du for eksempel har visioner om Milky Way-barer, kan det betyde, at du mangler et meget specifikt næringsstof i din kost. (Yup-det er mere kompliceret end chokoladebaren er så darn lækker.)<br/><br/>Vi talte med Los Angeles-baserede diætist Shira Lenchewski, M.S., R.D., for at få den tynde på nogle almindelige mad cravings, samt hvad du kan gøre for at mætte sulten uden at gå overbord. Fortsæt med at rulle for nogle seriøst gode oplysninger!<br/><br/>Hvis du vil have chokolade<br/><br/>Det betyder: Du kan mangle magnesium i din kost, siger Lenchewski. "Magnesium er et vigtigt mineral involveret i energiproduktion, glukosemetabolisme og muskelfunktion. Dette gælder især for dem, der rammer gymnastiksalen hårdt," forklarer hun. Derudover sænkes magnesiumniveauet i løbet af de præmenstruelle uger af din periode, hvilket forklarer, hvorfor PMS så ofte kommer med chokoladebehov.<br/><br/>I stedet nå til høj kvalitet, lavt sukker mørk chokolade, som er naturligt høj i magnesium. "Jeg anbefaler at holde sig til 75 procent kakao eller højere, og parring det med en anden magnesium-rige kilde som solsikkefrø," siger Lenchewski. Hun foreslår chokolademærket Hu, en lille batch fødevarevirksomhed, der fokuserer på ingredienser af høj kvalitet produceret lokalt. "Det er lidt dyrt, men så meget desto mere grund til at holde portioner i skak," siger hun. "Det er min personlige favorit." Vi er også store fans af superfood-pakket Zenbunni.<br/><br/>Hvis du vil have slik<br/><br/>Det betyder: "Græsning rent sukker er en god indikation af, at du er ved at løbe tør for energi," siger Lenchewski. "Tænk over det. Hvad er den ene ting, du klør efter efter en forfærdelig nats søvn eller omkring 4 pm i løbet af en stressende arbejdsdag? Svaret er normalt sukker, fordi det bruges som øjeblikkelig brændstof til vores krops celler.<br/><br/>I stedet nå til æbler med nøddesmør. "Hvis du raider dine kollegers slik, anbefaler jeg en mere langsom forbrænding kulhydrat med en kilde til fedt eller protein," siger Lenchewski. "I modsætning til simpelt sukker, vil dette brændstof dine celler og samtidig undgå post-sukker nedbrud. To muligheder, der gør for store pick-me-ups næste gang du ønsker slik: et skåret æble med dit valg af nøddesmør eller bær med 2% usødet græsk yoghurt. Vi kan også lide at knuse en sød tand med disse vanedannende kokoschips - de fylder, fri for tilsat sukker og bare så godt.<br/><br/>Hvis du har brug for salt<br/><br/>Det betyder: "Hvis intet andet end den salteste pickle vil gøre, kan du ikke drikke nok H2O," siger Lenchewski. "Salt hjælper kroppen med at holde fast i vand, så vi kræver det, når vi har brug for væsker."<br/><br/>I stedet nå til vand. "Bliv hydreret, især som vi nærmer os sommermånederne," siger hun. Næste gang en trang hits, prøv at slukke det (bogstaveligt talt) med et par forfriskende briller, og du kan finde det presserende at natrium binge forsvinder. "Hvis almindeligt vand keder dig, så prøv at tilføje i mynte, citron eller frossen frugt for at blande det op," siger Lenchewski. Og hvis det stadig ikke gør tricket, er der et sundere alternativ til sækkede chips eller pommes frites. "Hvis du virkelig bare ønsker salt trods alt, er ristet tang en god kaloriefattig mulighed," siger hun.<br/><br/>Hvis du ønsker stivelsesholdige kulhydrater som pasta<br/><br/>Det betyder: "Fordi høj-carb fødevarer øge feel-good hormon serotonin, kan stivelse cravings være et tegn på, at du har brug for en stemning booster," siger Lenchewski.<br/><br/>I stedet nå til et bad! "Bust ud Epsom salte, fordi det er tid til nogle alvorlige R + R," siger Lenchewski. "Stol på mig. Forkælelse i en stivelse fri-for-alle føles virkelig godt i øjeblikket, men det vil sandsynligvis bum du ud mere næste dag." (Som enhver, der nogensinde har over-forkælet en pizza eller pasta trang ved.) Så næste gang du ønsker at dykke hovedet først i en skål med kulhydrater, tegne et bad, tænde et stearinlys, og forkæl dig selv uden nogen fortrydelse eller tætte kalorier.<br/><br/>Hvis du ønsker is<br/><br/>5 / 6<br/><br/>Det betyder: "Din krop kan fortælle dig, at den har brug for noget sundt fedt."<br/><br/>"Jeg er realist, så hvis du har lyst til is, vil jeg ikke anbefale en håndfuld valnødder, som selvfølgelig er fulde af sundt fedt," siger Lenchewski. "For is nødsituationer, anbefaler jeg lavere-i-sukker kokosnød is som Coconut Bliss eller Kippy tre-ingrediens is i Los Angeles." Vi kan stå inde for det faktum, at kokosnød is smager utroligt og ligesom den ægte vare.<br/><br/>Hvis du ønsker en burger<br/><br/>Det betyder: Du har brug for jern. "Hvis du ikke kan stoppe med at tænke på rødt kød, er der en chance for, at din krop begærer jern, b12 og folsyre," siger Lenchewski. "Dette gælder især under eller omkring den tid af måneden."<br/><br/>I stedet nå til en sundere burger. "Jeg er en fortaler for græs fodret, antibiotika og hormonfri rødt kød en gang om ugen," siger Lenchewski. "Prøv at eksperimentere med en åben bison burger-som, skåret til skåret, er slankere og har mere jern end oksekød." Må ikke spise kød? Prøv at indarbejde en slags plantebaseret jerntilskud i din rutine, som spirulina. |

Spoiler alert: This brain teaser is entirely solvable. Scroll down to read the puzzle, and to get the answer. Good luck!<br/><br/>Here's The Puzzle<br/><br/>Alice and Bob are each told a number, but neither knows the other's number. Both of the numbers are positive and consecutive. In the room with Alice and Bob, there is a clock that dings every minute. Someone can guess the other's number only at the ding of that clock, but they can also remain silent. If someone correctly guesses the other's number on the first try, both people $1 million.<br/><br/>There is a way to win without any form of communication between Alice and Bob, and, duh, without cheating.

Hun hører uret ding N-1 gange, så hun ved, at Bob blev fortalt N + 1. Derfor kan hun på den næste ding korrekt gætte Bobs hemmelige nummer. Hvis vi har at gøre med små tal, kan det dog spilles anderledes. Hvis Alice blev fortalt 1, ved hun, at Bob blev fortalt 2, fordi 0 ikke er et positivt (eller negativt) tal.

| Web Services, Vendors And Cyber Laws!<br/><br/>Updated On:April 21, 2014Bilal Ahmad<br/><br/>Computerization of this world changed human performance scenario to a great extent and that too beyond measurement. For instance, Now you can send vital information all across the globe with a single mouse click, thanks to internet connectivity. Sadly, it is this wide connectivity and popularity among people, internet has also increased chances for computer crimes. Internet crimes or computer crimes are widely known as 'Cyber Crimes'.<br/><br/>'Cyber Laws' is something new in the judiciary system but has gained a lot of attention lately. The term cyber crime is something very synonymous with conventional crime, the only difference being medium of execution. There are majorly two types of cyber crimes, the first one is in which computers are the main targets and these include cases of data damage, malicious code and even criminal data access. The second one is in which computer is only a tool using which conventional crimes are committed for eg cyber terrorism, spamming, cyber stalking and many more.<br/><br/>This is where a website consultant or a vendor comes into scene. Although not aware of all the cyber laws present till date, a website vendor can advise you on some of the most vital cyber laws while creating your site.<br/><br/>This may include common knowledge of copy rights or even protecting the content of your own website. Explaining you all the rights you posses as a website owner is also one the tasks a website vendor may do while developing your website. A vendor can also assist you by offering you information on different cyber laws to protect data. Besides all of this, a vendor can also offer you information on any new cyber law that you may not be aware of till know. Cyber laws may vary from nation to nation, one recent example can be of the cookie law released in the United Kingdom, which prevents the website from saving any user browsing data. As per the Cookie Law, websites in the United Kingdom cannot save cookie files without informational consent from the surfer.<br/><br/>It is after the implementation of such law, websites now have a pop-up window, which seeks the consent of the visitor for saving cookies files. Such files are used by websites to analyze the browsing pattern of visitors based on which advertisements are then posted on a user window. With hacking not anymore a new thing for all of us, do you think such rules and regulations can prevent online forgery or cyber crime? Technology has developed at a rapid rate but still people do not prefer shopping online due to fear of personal or bank account details getting hacked. With the rise of cyber crime, need of stringent cyber laws have also increased to curb the same and to promote a risk free shopping experience.<br/><br/>Classes of Cyber Crimes<br/><br/>Over the years there have been three major classes of cyber crimes:<br/><br/>Unauthorized access of computer system cases, which involves hacking or stealing usernames and passwords to gain access over personal information of the respective user. These kind of backdoor access are organized with the help of Trojan Horse. Releasing malicious programs like Trojan House, worms or computer viruses etc. The last class includes cyber stalking a user or online harassment .<br/><br/>Direct implications of Cyber crimes<br/><br/>Decrease in sales<br/><br/>Decrease in staff output due to network delays<br/><br/>Loss of personalized information like research work<br/><br/>Disruption in communication process<br/><br/>Indirect implications of Cyber crimes<br/><br/>Credibility issue in our financial system<br/><br/>Brand image is tarnished in the market<br/><br/>Cyber crimes affect business to business relationship in the market<br/><br/>Sense of trust in state policies and government agencies is lost<br/><br/>Preventing Cyber Crime<br/><br/>As netizens there are certain precautions that we should consider for a safe and secure online experience. Here are some of them:<br/><br/>First thing to do will be to keep personal information to your self and avoid sharing the same online.<br/><br/>Avoid sharing any photographs with online chat friends or strangers.<br/><br/>Installing latest version of anti-virus on your system can offer you a good line of defense against internet threats like viruses and malware.<br/><br/>Keeping back up of your valuable data is a good option to avoid problems like virus contamination.<br/><br/>Avoid sending credit card information to sites that are unsecured and don't have any valid certificate.<br/><br/>Installing safety programme that offers you control over site cookies and saves you from being tracked by websites.<br/><br/>Putting host-based intrusions detection devices on servers will help you keep track of irregularities on your website traffic.<br/><br/>Use of firewall is advised.<br/><br/>Why Cyber attacks are so popular?<br/><br/>Cheaper than traditional cheating methods<br/><br/>Tracking cyber crimes are not easy<br/><br/>Exact locations cannot be tracked easily<br/><br/>Absence of physical barrier in the internet world<br/><br/>Cyber crimes affect large number of people<br/><br/>Conclusion<br/><br/>The fact that human mind has unfathomable power is undeniable, which is why internet crimes are increasing at a tremendous rate. Even history has witnessed some of the greatest internet security gone kaput by the hands of hackers, who have easily got away too. The only way to curb such crime is to remain aware of the cyber laws that we have today, that can either be through internet or through website/IT vendors. Information Technology Act has to be balanced in such a way that it proves too stringent for people who are involved in cyber crimes and at the same time it should never hamper the growth of Internet industry.<br/><br/>Author Bio:– Maneet Puri at present is heading a quality web design firm located at New Delhi, India. With unmatchable expertise in technical domain, he has been offering professional web consultation services to his clients located all round the globe. He is also an avid writer and some of his commended work have been published on renowned websites | Webtjenester, sælgere og cyberlove!<br/><br/>Opdateret den:April 21, 2014Bilal Ahmad<br/><br/>Computerisering af denne verden ændrede menneskets præstationsscenarie i høj grad, og det er også uden for måling. For eksempel kan du nu sende vitale oplysninger over hele kloden med et enkelt museklik takket være internetforbindelse. Desværre er det denne brede tilslutning og popularitet blandt mennesker, internettet har også øget chancerne for computerforbrydelser. Internetforbrydelser eller computerforbrydelser er almindeligt kendt som 'Cyber Crimes'.<br/><br/>'Cyber Laws' er noget nyt i retssystemet, men har fået meget opmærksomhed på det seneste. Udtrykket cyberkriminalitet er noget meget synonymt med konventionel kriminalitet, den eneste forskel er middel til udførelse. Der er stort set to typer af cyberkriminalitet, den første er, hvor computere er de vigtigste mål, og disse omfatter tilfælde af dataskader, ondsindet kode og endda kriminel dataadgang. Den anden er, hvor computer er kun et værktøj, der bruger, som konventionelle forbrydelser er begået for fx cyber terrorisme, spamming, cyber stalking og mange flere.<br/><br/>Det er her en hjemmeside konsulent eller en leverandør kommer ind på scenen. Selvom ikke klar over alle de cyber love til dato, en hjemmeside leverandør kan rådgive dig om nogle af de mest vitale cyber love, mens du opretter dit websted.<br/><br/>Dette kan omfatte fælles kendskab til kopirettigheder eller endda beskytte indholdet af din egen hjemmeside. Forklare dig alle de rettigheder, du besidder som en hjemmeside ejer er også en af de opgaver, en hjemmeside leverandør kan gøre, mens du udvikler din hjemmeside. En leverandør kan også hjælpe dig ved at tilbyde dig oplysninger om forskellige cyber love for at beskytte data. Udover alt dette, en leverandør kan også tilbyde dig oplysninger om enhver ny cyber lov, som du måske ikke er klar over indtil kender. Cyber love kan variere fra nation til nation, et nyligt eksempel kan være af cookie lov udgivet i Storbritannien, som forhindrer hjemmesiden i at gemme nogen bruger browsing data. Ifølge cookieloven kan websteder i Storbritannien ikke gemme cookiefiler uden samtykke fra surferen.<br/><br/>Det er efter implementeringen af en sådan lov, at websteder nu har et pop-up-vindue, der søger samtykke fra den besøgende til at gemme cookies-filer. Sådanne filer bruges af websteder til at analysere browsingmønsteret for besøgende baseret på hvilke annoncer, der derefter vises i et brugervindue. Med hacking ikke længere en ny ting for os alle, tror du, at sådanne regler og regler kan forhindre online forfalskning eller cyberkriminalitet? Teknologien har udviklet sig hurtigt, men folk foretrækker stadig ikke at handle online på grund af frygt for, at personlige eller bankkontooplysninger bliver hacket. Med stigningen i cyberkriminalitet er behovet for strenge cyberlove også steget for at bremse det samme og fremme en risikofri shoppingoplevelse.<br/><br/>Klasser af cyberkriminalitet<br/><br/>I årenes løb har der været tre hovedtyper af cyberkriminalitet:<br/><br/>Uautoriseret adgang til computersystemsager, som involverer hacking eller tyveri af brugernavne og adgangskoder for at få adgang til personlige oplysninger om den respektive bruger. Denne form for bagdørsadgang er organiseret ved hjælp af Trojan Horse. Frigivelse af ondsindede programmer som Trojan House, orme eller computervirus osv. Den sidste klasse omfatter cyber stalking en bruger eller online chikane.<br/><br/>Direkte implikationer af cyberkriminalitet<br/><br/>Fald i salget<br/><br/>Fald i personaleudbytte på grund af netværksforsinkelser<br/><br/>Tab af personlige oplysninger som forskningsarbejde<br/><br/>Forstyrrelser i kommunikationsprocessen<br/><br/>Indirekte konsekvenser af cyberkriminalitet<br/><br/>Troværdighed i vores finansielle system<br/><br/>Brand image er plettet på markedet<br/><br/>Cyberkriminalitet påvirker forholdet mellem virksomheder på markedet<br/><br/>Følelsen af tillid til statslige politikker og statslige organer er tabt<br/><br/>Forebyggelse af cyberkriminalitet<br/><br/>Som netizens er der visse forholdsregler, som vi bør overveje for en sikker og sikker online oplevelse. Her er nogle af dem:<br/><br/>Første ting at gøre vil være at holde personlige oplysninger til dig selv og undgå at dele det samme online.<br/><br/>Undgå at dele billeder med online chat venner eller fremmede.<br/><br/>Installation af nyeste version af anti-virus på dit system kan tilbyde dig en god linje af forsvar mod internet trusler som virus og malware.<br/><br/>Holde backup af dine værdifulde data er en god mulighed for at undgå problemer som virus forurening.<br/><br/>Undgå at sende kreditkortoplysninger til websteder, der er usikrede og ikke har noget gyldigt certifikat.<br/><br/>Installation af sikkerhedsprogram, der giver dig kontrol over webstedscookies og sparer dig for at blive sporet af websteder.<br/><br/>At sætte værtsbaserede enheder til registrering af indtrængen på servere vil hjælpe dig med at holde styr på uregelmæssigheder i trafikken på dit websted.<br/><br/>Brug af firewall anbefales.<br/><br/>Hvorfor er cyberangreb så populære?<br/><br/>Billigere end traditionelle snyd metoder<br/><br/>Cyberkriminalitet er ikke nemt<br/><br/>Nøjagtige placeringer kan ikke spores nemt<br/><br/>Fravær af fysiske barrierer i internetverdenen<br/><br/>Cyberkriminalitet rammer mange<br/><br/>Konklusion<br/><br/>Det faktum, at det menneskelige sind har ufattelig magt er ubestrideligt, hvilket er grunden til, at internetforbrydelser stiger i et enormt tempo. Selv historien har været vidne til nogle af de største internetsikkerhed gået kaput af hænderne på hackere, der har let sluppet væk også. Den eneste måde at bremse en sådan kriminalitet er at forblive opmærksom på de cyber love, som vi har i dag, der kan enten være via internettet eller gennem hjemmeside / IT-leverandører. Informationsteknologiloven skal afbalanceres på en sådan måde, at den viser sig at være for streng for folk, der er involveret i cyberkriminalitet, og samtidig bør den aldrig hæmme væksten i internetindustrien.<br/><br/>Forfatter Bio: - Maneet Puri leder i øjeblikket et kvalitets webdesignfirma beliggende i New Delhi, Indien.
