| UNDERSTANDING SELF-EXECUTING TREATIES VIA STATE PRACTICE<br/><br/>Updated: Feb 2<br/><br/>Introduction:<br/><br/>Consider this paradox, when a country ratifies a treaty, it is said to have consented to accept the treaty in its entirety (reservations and declarations being exceptions); but in some cases, the countries go ahead and refuse to adhere to its provisions. For example, Article VI, Clause 2 of the American Constitution has the provisions that "all treaties … shall be the supreme Law of the Land." Although it is evident that treaties on their own do not have the same effect as federal laws. In truth, they only become operational once these provisions come into force as Federal law with Senate and Presidential approval. Although this is the practice, it is a generally accepted principle in international law that certain treaties have a binding effect on countries. The treaty must fulfil the requirement of being a self-executing treaty to affect the country without any corresponding domestic legislature directly.<br/><br/>This raises the question as to which treaty will qualify as "self-executing" and which will not?<br/><br/>Whether a treaty is a self-executing treaty or not is decided by national judges on a case-to-case basis (Buergenthal, 1992). In order to understand this, the paper will first look at the two types of theories followed by countries on the nature of treaties applying to domestic law. These two theories are monism and dualism. They basically view the framework of domestic and international law as a single hierarchy and two separate hierarchies, respectively (Wildhaber, 1971). Countries following monism believe that certain treaties immediately are binding and immediately have an effect on the country. Once the treaty has been ratified, it can be invoked in national courts and is considered to be a part of the law of the country. Countries following dualism believe that a treaty does not affect domestic law until it has been reinforced by a legislature passed in the parliament. An example of dualism is how the European Convention on Human Rights became operational in the United Kingdom after passing the Human Rights Act 1998 in their parliament (Laws, 2000).<br/><br/>International law is diverse, and so are the types of procedures different countries follow for the acceptance of treaties. Some constitutions' themselves mention the procedures for the ratification of a treaty. Some countries even have different treatment given to international treaty law and customary international law. Certain international organizations like the European Union often affect the domestic law of its member states. The member states of the European Union have to give effect to certain forms of community legislature. Although, it has an essential difference from self-executing treaties. The difference is that it is not for national judges to decide whether the provisions are self-executing or not, but rather for the European Court of Justice to interpret under its constitutive treaties. Other forms of international law formed via resolutions or such might not have the same effect for these states. Nevertheless, they might consider them as forms of "soft law" and look into them to interpret the intent of the law. Sometimes, proclamations made by the judicial organs of international organizations such as the Inter-American Court of Human Rights affect their member states. Although these proclamations are not binding on the member states, the national judges seem to refer to these for authoritative interpretation.<br/><br/>Therefore, a case-to-case approach must be taken while analyzing the procedures and precedents set in different countries. To examine the concept of self-executing treaties, this paper will compare the precedents set by different jurisdictions. If the reader wishes to conduct a similar analysis, they can do so by looking into the different national yearbooks on international law. Mostly, these yearbooks will have a section devoted to the relationship between international and national law.<br/><br/>International Jurisprudence:<br/><br/>The most significant issue that comes up for national courts is whether the treaty is self-executing? If the treaty can be applied without any additional domestic legislature having passed to reinforce it. This question came up in the case of Czesław S v State Treasury and Minister of the State Treasury, wherein the Polish Constitutional Court held that since the treaty provisions referred to domestic measures to be taken, the treaty was not self-executing in nature (Bug river claims, Czesław S v State Treasury and Minister of the State Treasury, 2003). Essentially, when the treaty refers to domestic measures to be taken, it does not in itself create new obligations. It instead reinforces the treaty's intent for the domestic legal process to take measures for the same. A similar issue was raised in the Sosa case in the United States of America. In this case, the court considered whether the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights was a self-executing treaty. The American Supreme Court has also declared that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is not a self-executing treaty (Court, 2004). The Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland also examined the self-executing nature of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The issue before the court was whether Article 13(2)(b) and (c) were self-executing in nature. The court examined whether the treaty was partially self-executing and did so by checking whether there existed a minimum core content for the treaty to be applicable. The court held that it found no such provision within the treaty (A and B v Government of the Canton of Zurich, 2000).<br/><br/>It is essential to understand that these issues differ from the fundamental question of whether international law can be applied as part of the law of the land? In order to answer this question, the paper will examine the judgement by the Supreme Court of the Dominican Republic. The Supreme Court stated that Article 3 of the Dominican Republic's Constitution made international law binding on the domestic legal order. The court rejected the Superior Land Court's interpretation that these treaties were "foreign legislature" and not part of the domestic legal order. The Supreme Court laid down that all treaties ratified by the Dominican Republic formed a part of Dominican Law and, therefore, can be termed as self-executing (Gallardo Montilla v Gallardo Concepción and ors, 1997). The Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland has examined whether the Libson Treaty was self-executing and directly applicable to Swiss Universities. The court held, "According to relevant case law, a treaty norm is directly applicable if its content is sufficiently precise and clear to form the basis of a decision in a particular case. The norm thus has to be justiciable, i.e. define the rights and obligations of an individual and be directed at the competent authorities" (X v University of Lucerne, 2014). This implies that whether the treaty is directly applicable or not, depends upon on whether the norm is justiciable. The Lisbon Treaty is based on the principle of qualifications acquired aboard. This is conveyed through Article IV (1) of the treaty. The purpose of this was to create an obligation for states to show that their decision-making process is fair, transparent and non-discriminatory. The responsibility for proving that the applicant has not met the required criteria is on the "body undertaking the assessment." The treaty guarantees procedural safeguards, which are generally accepted by countries and hence, the court held this treaty to be self-executing. This goes on to showcase the different interpretations undertaken by the courts of various countries.<br/><br/>It is essential to observe whether the norms set out by treaties are actually being complied with. The case laws from various jurisdictions have emphasized that national courts are the final authority on the issue of whether a treaty is self-executing. There is also an inherent duty cast on countries for the observance and due performance of treaties. Such is cast by the Pacta Sunt Servanda rule as enshrined within Article 26 of the Vienna Convention on Law of Treaties (VCLT). Article 27 goes on to reinforce it by stating that international law obligations cannot be ignored by using domestic law as a justification. Many countries' courts have used this as a source of interpretation, such as the Latvian Constitutional Court. In the case of a national norm conflicting with an international norm, the court held that the national norm was null and void. To reach its conclusion, the court strongly relied on the necessary performance of treaties in good faith as envisaged in Article 26 of the VCLT (Linija v Latvia, 2004).<br/><br/>Conclusion:<br/><br/>From the above, it is clear that treaties have particular requirements before they can be considered self-executing. However, keeping all of these aside, the most important still remains the national courts' interpretation. The national courts decide whether the treaty can be called self-executing or not. Although their Constitution's might contain a provision regarding treaty law being the supreme law of the land, courts from different countries interpret these provisions in different manners. This can be seen as to how the American and Dominican Constitutions' both contain these provisions but follow completely different interpretations of the same. The term "self-executing" may not be congruous for these treaties since, in practice, they still need approval from the national courts. Ideally, the way forward should be that countries acknowledge the self-executing nature of treaties and treat them in a fashion wherein Article 26 and 27 of the VCLT are respected. Again, this is the "ideal" situation and is not likely to find its way into state practice of certain jurisdictions anytime soon. Still, hope can be gained via looking into the interpretations of national courts that respect these norms and hopefully pave the way for other courts to acknowledge this.<br/><br/>References:<br/><br/>Buergenthal, T.

For eksempel har artikel VI, klausul 2 i den amerikanske forfatning bestemmelser om, at "alle traktater ... skal være den øverste lov i delstaten." Selv om det er klart, at traktater på egen hånd ikke har samme virkning som føderale love. Faktisk bliver de først operationelle, når disse bestemmelser træder i kraft som føderal lov med Senatet og præsidentens godkendelse. Selv om dette er praksis, er det et almindeligt accepteret princip i folkeretten, at visse traktater har en bindende virkning på landene. Traktaten skal opfylde kravet om at være en selvudøvende traktat for at påvirke landet uden nogen tilsvarende indenlandsk lovgiver direkte.<br/><br/>Dette rejser spørgsmålet om, hvilken traktat der kan betegnes som "selvudførelse", og hvem der ikke vil?<br/><br/>Om en traktat er en selvudførelsestraktat eller ej afgøres af nationale dommere fra sag til sag (Buergenthal, 1992). For at forstå dette vil papiret først se på de to typer teorier efterfulgt af lande om arten af traktater, der gælder for national lovgivning. Disse to teorier er monisme og dualisme. De ser grundlæggende rammerne for national og international ret som henholdsvis et enkelt hierarki og to separate hierarkier (Wildhaber, 1971). Lande efter monisme mener, at visse traktater straks er bindende og straks har en virkning på landet. Når traktaten er blevet ratificeret, kan den påberåbes i nationale domstole og anses for at være en del af landets lovgivning. Lande efter dualisme mener, at en traktat ikke påvirker den nationale lovgivning, før den er blevet styrket af en lovgivende forsamling vedtaget i parlamentet. Et eksempel på dualisme er, hvordan Den Europæiske Menneskerettighedskonvention blev operationel i Det Forenede Kongerige efter vedtagelsen af Menneskerettighedsloven 1998 i deres parlament (Lov, 2000).<br/><br/>Folkeretten er forskelligartet, og det samme gælder de procedurer, som forskellige lande følger for at acceptere traktater. Nogle lande har endda forskellig behandling givet til international traktatret og sædvaneret. Visse internationale organisationer som Den Europæiske Union påvirker ofte den nationale lovgivning i sine medlemsstater. Den Europæiske Unions medlemsstater skal gennemføre visse former for fællesskabslovgivende forsamling, selv om den har en væsentlig forskel fra selvudførelsestraktater. Forskellen er, at det ikke er op til de nationale dommere at afgøre, om bestemmelserne er selvudøvende eller ej, men snarere op til EF-Domstolen at fortolke dem i henhold til dens forfatningsmæssige traktater. Andre former for international ret, der er dannet via resolutioner eller lignende, har måske ikke samme virkning for disse stater. Ikke desto mindre kan de betragte dem som former for "blød lov" og se på dem for at fortolke lovens hensigt. Nogle gange påvirker proklamationer fra de retslige organer i internationale organisationer som Den Interamerikanske Menneskerettighedsdomstol deres medlemsstater. Selv om disse proklamationer ikke er bindende for medlemsstaterne, synes de nationale dommere at henvise til disse for autoritativ fortolkning.<br/><br/>Derfor skal der tages en case-to-case tilgang, mens man analyserer de procedurer og præcedenser, der er fastsat i forskellige lande. For at undersøge begrebet selvudførelsestraktater vil dette papir sammenligne præcedenserne, der er fastsat af forskellige jurisdiktioner. Hvis læseren ønsker at foretage en lignende analyse, kan de gøre det ved at se på de forskellige nationale årbøger om international ret. For det meste vil disse årbøger have et afsnit afsat til forholdet mellem international og national ret.<br/><br/>International retspraksis:<br/><br/>Det vigtigste spørgsmål, der kommer op for de nationale domstole, er, om traktaten er selvudøvende? Hvis traktaten kan anvendes uden nogen yderligere national lovgiver, der har bestået for at styrke den. Dette spørgsmål blev rejst i sagen Czesáw S mod statskassen og ministeren for statskassen, hvor den polske forfatningsdomstol fastslog, at eftersom traktatens bestemmelser omhandlede indenlandske foranstaltninger, der skulle træffes, var traktaten ikke selvudøvende af natur (Bug river claims, Czesáw S mod statskassen og ministeren for statskassen, 2003). Når traktaten i det væsentlige henviser til nationale foranstaltninger, der skal træffes, skaber den ikke i sig selv nye forpligtelser, men styrker i stedet traktatens hensigt om, at den nationale retsproces skal træffe foranstaltninger til det samme. Et lignende spørgsmål blev rejst i Sosa-sagen i USA. I dette tilfælde overvejede retten, om den internationale konvention om borgerlige og politiske rettigheder var en selvudøvende traktat. Den amerikanske højesteret har også erklæret, at den internationale konvention om borgerlige og politiske rettigheder ikke er en selvudøvende traktat (Domstolen, 2004). Den føderale højesteret i Schweiz undersøgte også den selvudøvende karakter af den internationale konvention om borgerlige og politiske rettigheder. Spørgsmålet for retten var, om artikel 13, stk. 2, litra b) og c), var selvudøvende karakter. Domstolen undersøgte, om traktaten var delvis selvudførelse og gjorde det ved at kontrollere, om der eksisterede et minimum kerneindhold for traktaten at være gældende. Domstolen fastslog, at den ikke fandt en sådan bestemmelse i traktaten (A og B mod regeringen i kantonen Zurich, 2000).<br/><br/>Det er vigtigt at forstå, at disse spørgsmål adskiller sig fra det grundlæggende spørgsmål om, hvorvidt folkeretten kan anvendes som en del af landets lov? For at besvare dette spørgsmål vil papiret undersøge dommen fra Den Dominikanske Republiks højesteret. Højesteret fastslog, at artikel 3 i Den Dominikanske Republiks forfatning gjorde folkeretten bindende for den nationale retsorden. Retten afviste Superior Land Court fortolkning, at disse traktater var "udenlandske lovgiver" og ikke en del af den indenlandske retsorden. Højesteret fastslog, at alle traktater ratificeret af Den Dominikanske Republik udgjorde en del af Den Dominikanske Lov og derfor kan betegnes som selvudførelse (Gallardo Montilla v Gallardo Concepción and ors, 1997). Den føderale højesteret i Schweiz har undersøgt, om Libson-traktaten var selvudøvende og direkte gældende for schweiziske universiteter. Ifølge relevant retspraksis er en traktatnorm direkte anvendelig, hvis dens indhold er tilstrækkeligt præcist og klart til at danne grundlag for en afgørelse i en bestemt sag. Normen skal således være retfærdig, dvs. definere en persons rettigheder og forpligtelser og være rettet mod de kompetente myndigheder" (X mod University of Lucerne, 2014). Dette indebærer, at om traktaten er direkte anvendelig eller ej, afhænger af, om normen er retfærdig. Lissabontraktaten er baseret på princippet om kvalifikationer erhvervet om bord. Dette formidles gennem traktatens artikel IV, stk. 1. Formålet med dette var at skabe en forpligtelse for staterne til at vise, at deres beslutningsproces er retfærdig, gennemsigtig og ikke-diskriminerende. Ansvaret for at bevise, at ansøgeren ikke har opfyldt de krævede kriterier ligger hos det organ, der foretager vurderingen. Traktaten garanterer retssikkerhedsgarantier, som generelt accepteres af landene, og domstolen fastslog derfor, at denne traktat var selvudøvende. Dette fortsætter med at vise de forskellige fortolkninger, som domstolene i forskellige lande har foretaget.<br/><br/>Det er vigtigt at være opmærksom på, om de normer, der er fastsat i traktaterne, faktisk overholdes. Retspraksis fra forskellige jurisdiktioner har understreget, at de nationale domstole er den endelige myndighed i spørgsmålet om, hvorvidt en traktat er selvudøvende. Der påhviler også landene en iboende pligt til at overholde og overholde traktater, hvilket fremgår af Pacta Sunt Servanda-reglen, som er nedfældet i artikel 26 i Wienerkonventionen om traktatretten (VCLT). Artikel 27 styrker den yderligere ved at fastslå, at forpligtelser i henhold til folkeretten ikke kan ignoreres ved at bruge national ret som begrundelse, hvilket mange landes domstole har brugt som en kilde til fortolkning, såsom den lettiske forfatningsdomstol. I tilfælde af en national norm, der er i strid med en international norm, fastslog retten, at den nationale norm var ugyldig. For at nå frem til sin konklusion påberåbte retten sig kraftigt den nødvendige opfyldelse af traktater i god tro som omhandlet i artikel 26 i VCLT (Linija mod Letland, 2004).<br/><br/>Konklusion:<br/><br/>Af ovenstående fremgår det klart, at traktater har særlige krav, før de kan betragtes som selvudførelse, men når man ser bort fra alle disse, er den vigtigste stadig de nationale domstoles fortolkning. De nationale domstole afgør, om traktaten kan kaldes selvudførelse eller ej. Selv om deres forfatning kan indeholde en bestemmelse om traktatret er den øverste lov i landet, domstole fra forskellige lande fortolke disse bestemmelser på forskellige måder. Dette kan ses med hensyn til, hvordan de amerikanske og dominikanske forfatninger begge indeholder disse bestemmelser, men følger helt forskellige fortolkninger af det samme. Udtrykket "selvudførelse" er måske ikke kongruent med disse traktater, da de i praksis stadig skal godkendes af de nationale domstole. Ideelt set bør vejen frem være, at landene anerkender traktaternes selvudførelse og behandler dem på en måde, hvor artikel 26 og 27 i VCLT respekteres. Igen er dette den "ideelle" situation og vil sandsynligvis ikke finde vej til statslig praksis i visse jurisdiktioner når som helst snart. Alligevel kan håbet vindes ved at se på fortolkninger af nationale domstole, der respekterer disse normer og forhåbentlig bane vejen for andre domstole til at anerkende dette.<br/><br/>Referencer:<br/><br/>Buergenthal, T.

So, you could say they have two sources of income, which is something that most people in their line of work don't have.<br/><br/>However, back in 2017, the Alaska Department of Fish and Game started a quota system, which limited the amount of fish any fishing boat could bring back to shore by half. That meant the crew on Deadliest Catch experienced a huge drop in profits for several years. Hey, at least they have Discovery to pay the bills, right? | Behind-the-Scenes Tragedier, Der Påvirkede Afstøbningen Af Tv's Dødeligste Fangst<br/><br/>Sænkede fiskekvoter<br/><br/>Selvom besætningen på Deadliest Catch tjener størstedelen af deres penge fra Discovery, betyder det ikke, at de faktisk ikke sælger deres haul. Så man kan sige, at de har to indtægtskilder, hvilket er noget, som de fleste mennesker i deres branche ikke har.<br/><br/>Men tilbage i 2017 startede Alaska Department of Fish and Game et kvotesystem, som begrænsede mængden af fisk, som enhver fiskerbåd kunne bringe tilbage til land med halvdelen. Det betød, at besætningen på Deadliest Catch oplevede et stort fald i overskuddet i flere år. |

Whether it is a last-minute job request or a paper that you forgot to write and it is due the next day, stress can always find a way into your day if you allow it. Today I will show you a few things you can do to eliminate or prevent stress.<br/><br/>The first thing you can do is to exercise. Exercising is a great way to relieve stress because it lowers the stress hormone in your body known as cortisol. The lower levels of cortisol in your body, the lower your stress level will be. Exercise can also increase your confidence, and when your confidence is up then your stress is usually down. For me, when I get stressed, I always exercise by going to the gym and practice boxing, it helps me burn calories and reduce stress while having fun.<br/><br/>Writing things down has been a way to calm people down for a very long time, and it is the next topic on our list. Writing down what is making you stressed is a way to clear the mind, and it helps get rid of stress as well. I have a similar experience when writing stories, usually if I cannot think of a new idea because of an old one, I will write the old idea down and think on it. That is when new ideas start to spring up and I can continue writing normally. It is the same with stress. Think about a stream it continues to flow down it's path until it hits a beaver dam, and that dam blocks the flow of water and everything starts to build up. The only way to get the water flow back to normal is to remove the dam. This is where writing comes in. When you write it down, you are removing stress piece by piece until you can think normally again.<br/><br/>Stress can come into our lives through doors in our life that we keep open. Procrastination is a way that we can leave the doors open for stress. Waiting until tomorrow may be fun for today, but it will hurt you tomorrow, and is a very short-sighted solution. The longer you wait to do something, the larger that something becomes, and the larger it becomes the more stress you will be inviting into your life. Taking care of something as soon as we receive it is a great way to prevent stress, but it is something that takes great discipline to do. The more you cut Procrastination out of your life, the more stress free you will be. So shut that door, you're letting all the cold air out.<br/><br/>So let's review: Exercise, Write down what is stressing you, and Do not Procrastinate. These are only a few ways to relieve stress but to me, they are the most effective. While I know these may not work for everyone I would like to invite anyone feeling stressed to research how to get rid of it. | BLOGS<br/><br/>Tjek vores samling af blogs skrevet af kolleger medarbejdere.<br/><br/>INFORMATIONSBLOGG<br/><br/>Lad være med at stresse<br/><br/>ved<br/>Kristen Hogan<br/>Udgivet den 12. november, 2020<br/><br/>Stress, uanset hvor store ting går, kan det altid finde en måde at rejse sit grimme hoved. Uanset om det er en sidste øjebliks jobanmodning eller et papir, som du glemte at skrive, og det skyldes den næste dag, kan stress altid finde en vej ind i din dag, hvis du tillader det. I dag vil jeg vise dig et par ting, du kan gøre for at eliminere eller forebygge stress.<br/><br/>Den første ting du kan gøre er at udøve. Motion er en fantastisk måde at lindre stress, fordi det sænker stress hormon i din krop kendt som cortisol. De lavere niveauer af cortisol i din krop, jo lavere din stress niveau vil være. Motion kan også øge din selvtillid, og når din selvtillid er op, er din stress normalt nede. For mig, når jeg bliver stresset, træner jeg altid ved at gå til gymnastik og øve boksning, det hjælper mig med at forbrænde kalorier og reducere stress, mens jeg har det sjovt.<br/><br/>At skrive ting ned har været en måde at berolige folk på i meget lang tid, og det er det næste emne på vores liste. At skrive ned, hvad der gør dig stresset, er en måde at rydde sindet på, og det hjælper også med at slippe af med stress. Jeg har en lignende oplevelse, når jeg skriver historier, normalt hvis jeg ikke kan tænke på en ny idé på grund af en gammel, vil jeg skrive den gamle idé ned og tænke på det. Det er når nye ideer begynder at springe op, og jeg kan fortsætte med at skrive normalt. Det er det samme med stress. Tænk på en strøm, den fortsætter med at strømme ned ad sin sti, indtil den rammer en bæverdæmning, og den dæmning blokerer strømmen af vand, og alt begynder at opbygge. Den eneste måde at få vandstrømmen tilbage til det normale er at fjerne dæmningen. Når du skriver det ned, fjerner du stress stykke for stykke, indtil du kan tænke normalt igen.<br/><br/>Stress kan komme ind i vores liv gennem døre i vores liv, som vi holder åbne. Udsættelse er en måde, hvorpå vi kan lade dørene åbne for stress. Venter til i morgen kan være sjovt for i dag, men det vil skade dig i morgen, og er en meget kortsigtet løsning. Jo længere du venter på at gøre noget, jo større bliver det, og jo større bliver det, jo mere stress vil du invitere ind i dit liv. At tage sig af noget, så snart vi modtager det, er en fantastisk måde at forhindre stress på, men det er noget, der kræver stor disciplin at gøre. Jo mere du skærer Udsættelse ud af dit liv, jo mere stressfri bliver du. Så luk døren, du lukker al den kolde luft ud.<br/><br/>Så lad os gennemgå: Motion, Skriv ned, hvad der stresser dig, og Udsæt ikke. Disse er kun et par måder at lindre stress på, men for mig er de de mest effektive. Selvom jeg ved, at disse måske ikke virker for alle, vil jeg gerne invitere nogen, der føler sig stresset, til at undersøge, hvordan man kan slippe af med det. |
