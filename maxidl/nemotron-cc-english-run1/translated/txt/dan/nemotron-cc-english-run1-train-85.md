The ambiguity arises from the fact that static pressure can be used, correctly, to refer to the free-stream pressure in external flows, but it is more often, and not always correctly, used to refer to the pressure in a generic point of a flow field, typically when discussing the Bernoulli equation. In order to avoid ambiguity, alternative expressions that could be used, depending on the context, are free-stream pressure, fluid pressure, thermodynamic pressure or often just pressure.<br/><br/>Equivalence of static and free-stream pressure<br/><br/>We consider as an example the atmosphere, at rest relatively to the ground. An observer standing on the ground would see a generic fluid element as not moving, and subject to the local static pressure (which, in this case, is the atmospheric pressure).<br/>We now consider an aircraft that flies straight and level with speed (airspeed and ground speed are the same, in this example), approaching the same fluid element from great distance. The distance is such that the fluid element is not perturbed by the approaching aircraft. To an observer on board the aircraft, the fluid element, like all the fluid elements at the same distance, appears as being in free-stream conditions, where all the fluid elements flow straight towards the aircraft with the same constant velocity and there are no pressure gradients inside the fluid (that is the pressure is constant anywhere in that region of fluid).[4] Given that the fluid element is the same for both observers, so is the pressure to which the element is subject, therefore what an observer at rest calls static pressure is in fact the free-stream pressure to an observer moving relatively to the fluid. This is the only case in fluid dynamics where, strictly speaking, the expression static pressure can be used appropriately[citation needed], i.e. to refer to the free-stream pressure.<br/>Note that when the fluid element comes in proximity to the aircraft, free-stream conditions are lost, its velocity changes and pressure gradients develop. The pressure exerted on the element, therefore, will not be, in general, equal to the static pressure anymore.<br/><br/>Static pressure and the Bernoulli equation<br/><br/>The Bernoulli equation, assuming incompressible, inviscid flow and negligible gravitational effects, can be written as follows:<br/><br/>Since the term ρv2 / 2 is, by definition, the so-called dynamic pressure, the term p, by contrast, is usually named static pressure although it may, or may not, refer to the above mentioned free-stream pressure. The two possible cases are:<br/><br/>Bernoulli equation referred to free-stream conditions – When the Bernoulli equation is applied to a point of the flow field far upstream of any object, both pressure and velocity take their respective free-stream values and , therefore the Bernoulli equation can be correctly read as "the sum of static pressure and (free-stream) dynamic pressure is constant across the flow field".<br/><br/>Bernoulli equation referred to a generic point – When the Bernoulli equation is written for a generic point A of the flow field, for example a point close to an airfoil, the value of the fluid pressure pA is in general different from the free-stream one, and, strictly speaking, the term should not be referred to as static pressure. The Bernoulli equation could be correctly read, for example, as "the sum of fluid pressure in A and dynamic pressure in A is constant across the flow field". Nevertheless it is very common to refer to the non-velocity-dependent term of the Bernoulli equation as static pressure anyway, regardless of whether it is applied to free-stream conditions or not.<br/><br/>The two cases can be summarized by applying the Bernoulli equation to different points of the flow field: a point far upstream, a generic point close to a body and, for completeness, a stagnation point on the body's surface:<br/><br/>where:<br/><br/>= free-stream (static) pressure<br/><br/>ρ = fluid density (assumed constant)<br/><br/>= free-stream velocity<br/><br/>p = fluid pressure in a generic point<br/><br/>v = velocity in a generic point<br/><br/>pS = stagnation (or total) pressure<br/><br/>See also<br/><br/>References<br/><br/>^ There are only a few areas (e.g. some parts of the fuselage or along the outside of a Pitot tube) where the pressure exerted is equal to the static pressure; those are the places where static ports are located.<br/><br/>^ A pressure gradient would in fact cause an acceleration, and so the velocity would not be constant anymore. Note also that we are neglecting the variation of atmospheric pressure with altitude. | Indholdsfortegnelse<br/><br/>Statisk tryk i væskedynamik<br/><br/>Brugen af udtrykket statisk tryk i væskedynamik er meget almindelig, selv om det kan føre til tvetydighed. Tvetydigheden skyldes, at statisk tryk kan bruges korrekt til at henvise til fristrømstrykket i eksterne strømme, men det bruges oftere og ikke altid korrekt til at henvise til trykket i et generisk punkt i et flowfelt, typisk når man diskuterer Bernoulli-ligningen. For at undgå tvetydighed, alternative udtryk, der kunne anvendes, afhængigt af konteksten, er fri-stream tryk, væsketryk, termodynamisk tryk eller ofte bare tryk.<br/><br/>Ekvivalens af statisk og fristrømstryk<br/><br/>Vi betragter som et eksempel atmosfæren, i ro i forhold til jorden. En observatør stående på jorden ville se en generisk væske element som ikke bevæger sig, og underlagt det lokale statiske tryk (som i dette tilfælde er det atmosfæriske tryk).<br/>Vi betragter nu et fly, der flyver lige og niveau med hastighed (airspeed og jordhastighed er de samme, i dette eksempel), nærmer sig det samme flydende element fra stor afstand. Afstanden er sådan, at det flydende element ikke forstyrres af det nærmer sig fly. For en observatør om bord på flyet, det flydende element, ligesom alle de flydende elementer i samme afstand, synes at være i fri-stream betingelser, hvor alle de flydende elementer strømmer lige mod flyet med den samme konstante hastighed, og der er ingen trykgradienter inde i væsken. Dette er det eneste tilfælde i fluid dynamik, hvor strengt taget udtrykket statisk tryk kan anvendes hensigtsmæssigt, dvs. at henvise til fristrømstrykket.<br/>Bemærk, at når væskeelementet kommer i nærheden af flyet, går fristrømsforholdene tabt, dets hastighedsændringer og trykgradienter udvikler sig. Det tryk, der udøves på elementet, vil derfor generelt ikke være lig med det statiske tryk længere.<br/><br/>Statisk tryk og Bernoulli-ligningen<br/><br/>Bernoulli-ligningen, der antager incompressible, usynlige flow og ubetydelige gravitationelle virkninger, kan skrives som følger:<br/><br/>Da udtrykket "v2 / 2" pr. definition er det såkaldte dynamiske tryk, kaldes udtrykket p derimod normalt statisk tryk, selvom det kan eller ikke kan henvise til ovennævnte fristrømstryk. De to mulige tilfælde er:<br/><br/>Når Bernoulli ligningen anvendes på et punkt i flowfeltet langt opstrøms for ethvert objekt, både tryk og hastighed tage deres respektive fristrømsværdier og derfor Bernoulli ligningen kan læses korrekt som "summen af statisk tryk og (fristrøms) dynamisk tryk er konstant på tværs af flowfeltet".<br/><br/>Bernoulli ligning henvist til et generisk punkt - Når Bernoulli ligning er skrevet for et generisk punkt A af flowfeltet, for eksempel et punkt tæt på en airfoil, værdien af væsketrykket pA er generelt forskellig fra den frie strøm en, og strengt taget bør udtrykket ikke betegnes som statisk tryk. Bernoulli-ligningen kunne for eksempel læses korrekt, da "summen af væsketryk i A og dynamisk tryk i A er konstant på tværs af strømningsfeltet". Ikke desto mindre er det meget almindeligt at henvise til den ikke-hastighedsafhængige sigt af Bernoulli ligningen som statisk tryk alligevel, uanset om det anvendes til fristrømsbetingelser eller ej.<br/><br/>De to tilfælde kan opsummeres ved at anvende Bernoulli-ligningen på forskellige punkter i strømningsfeltet: et punkt langt opstrøms, et generisk punkt tæt på en krop og for fuldstændighed et stagnationspunkt på kroppens overflade:<br/><br/>hvor:<br/><br/>= fristrømstryk (statisk tryk)<br/><br/>- = væsketæthed (antaget konstant)<br/><br/>= fristrømshastighed<br/><br/>p = væsketryk i et generisk punkt<br/><br/>v = hastighed i et generisk punkt<br/><br/>pS = stagnation (eller total) tryk<br/><br/>Se også<br/><br/>Referencer<br/><br/>^ Der er kun få områder (f.eks. nogle dele af skroget eller langs ydersiden af et Pitot-rør), hvor trykket er lig med det statiske tryk; det er de steder, hvor statiske porte er placeret.<br/><br/>^ En trykgradient ville faktisk forårsage en acceleration, og så ville hastigheden ikke være konstant længere. Bemærk også, at vi forsømmer variationen af atmosfærisk tryk med højde. |
