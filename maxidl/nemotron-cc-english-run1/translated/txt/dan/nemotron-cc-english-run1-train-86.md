| Leclaire<br/><br/>The historic Leclaire neighborhood, once referred to as Edwardsville's "suburb to the south," was founded as a cooperative community in 1890 and remained a separate village until annexed to the city of Edwardsville in 1934. Newspapers and magazines throughout the United States and Europe reported on the Leclaire experiment, particularly during the first 20 years of its existence. In 1979, due to its unique history, the former village was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.<br/><br/>Leclaire was founded by Nelson Oliver Nelson, a St. Louis plumbing manufacturer who, for many years, sought to advance the plight of the working class. Nelson wanted to improve working conditions for his employees and provide housing near the factories so workers and their families could easily participate in recreational and educational programs offered free of charge by the company. Prior to 1890, while still in St. Louis, the N. O. Nelson Company's manufacturing and distribution businesses began providing profit sharing along with educational and recreational opportunities. The Leclaire cooperative experiment would bring additional benefits.<br/><br/>When Nelson employees indicated they wanted to relocate to a rural location, company representatives approached leaders of small towns in several Missouri and Illinois communities near their St. Louis headquarters. They were looking for a suitable property to build new factories and a model village. South of Edwardsville they found a 125-acre tract of land with access to water, coal, and transportation. Local businessmen acted quickly to offer a financial incentive. In less than three weeks, the community raised a fund of $20,000 from individual contributions of between $1 and $1,000 to entice Nelson to choose Edwardsville for his enterprise.<br/><br/>City leaders had hoped to locate property inside the city limits of Edwardsville, but when no suitable site could be found, they were confident that the Nelson investment south of town would soon become a part of Edwardsville. Although Nelson fulfilled all the contingencies for construction and job creation in his contract, it would be 44 years before annexation to Edwardsville. Leclaire, bounded by Madison/Brown Avenues to the east, the railroad tracks to the west, Hadley/McKinley Avenues on the south and Wolf Street to the north, remained an independent village from 1890 to 1934. During that time it earned a reputation for innovations in business, education and residential planning.<br/><br/>The village of Leclaire on a 1931 map of Edwardsville<br/>Courtesy of Paul Jenkins<br/><br/>Nelson's decision to build a village was not made on a whim. By the late 1880s he was an international leader in the fields of cooperation and profit-sharing, exchanging social theories with others around the world while expanding his St. Louis business. He named his experimental village after the Parisian profit-sharer, Edme Jean Leclaire, but he visited many other social visionaries who provided information and inspiration. Compiling the best ideas from these examples, Nelson founded Leclaire to, in his words, "give work, promote intelligence, provide recreation, foster beauty, and make homes." These were all factors he determined necessary for men to lead fulfilling lives. Later writers used these words to formulate Leclaire's founding principles: Work, Homes, Education, Recreation, and Beauty, but with the additional important principle of Freedom.<br/><br/>Work<br/><br/>Work could be considered the most important of these factors since without the factory jobs in Leclaire, there would be no village. The brick factory buildings were designed by architect E. A. Cameron to provide natural light, ventilation in the summer, and heated floors in the winter. There was a fire suppression system and, although industrial accidents were not eliminated, every effort was made to guarantee the safety of the workers. The ivy-covered brick buildings were surrounded by well-manicured lawns and flower gardens giving the complex a campus-like appearance. In 1894, New York World reporter Nellie Bly called the buildings "the ideal perfection of buildings for man to labor in".<br/><br/>The manufacturing complex of the N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company in Leclaire<br/>From Friends of Leclaire<br/><br/>Nelson company policies were designed to protect the financial stability of employees. Workers could earn a share of the profits and have a voice in the company if they chose that option. The profit-sharing plan gave Nelson employees a pride of ownership that resulted in a supportive workforce. There were a few short-lived labor strikes over the years, but for the most part, labor problems were rare. Workers also had reasonable hours and competitive wages. There was a provident fund that provided for pensions and sick leave, as well as widow pensions if a worker died, whether or not the death was related to his employment.<br/><br/>Company headquarters for the N. O. Nelson Company (NONCO) remained in St. Louis, but all of the N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company was moved to Leclaire. The manufacturing company was divided into shops that made a variety of products. In 1900, the shops became independent companies for tax purposes, but all were still owned by the N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company. The shops included the Cabinet Mill where wood products from cabinetry to millwork were produced. The skilled craftsmen that worked here also fulfilled special contracts, including teller cages for a local bank and an altar still in use at St. Andrew's Episcopal Church in Edwardsville. The Marble Shop specialized in architectural marble that was cut and installed by Nelson crews in homes, businesses, and even state capitols throughout the Midwest. The Machine Shop, which became Bignall and Keeler, made pipe fitting machines, pumps, gauges, and various mechanical tools expected in the plumbing trade. They also branched out to manufacture specialty items like the Leclaire Bicycle in the mid-1890s. The Brass Shop included a foundry where various plumbing pipes and tools were manufactured. These examples represent just some of the work done in the Leclaire factories. The company's logo was a stylized "NONCO" that can still be seen on plumbing fixtures and some fire hydrants in Edwardsville today.<br/><br/>Homes<br/><br/>Before homes could be built, housing was needed for workers who were completing the factory buildings as well as building homes. To meet those needs, the company built the "Club House," a large building that served many purposes. In addition to lodging, it was the community's first educational building, and it contained a well-stocked library.<br/><br/>Construction of the residential portion of Leclaire began immediately after the village was founded in June of 1890. Julius Pitzman, the innovative landscape architect who laid out the first lots in Leclaire, set them up with a number of protective covenants. The covenants provided for wide, curvilinear streets, large lots, and a deed restriction that limited the properties to residential or educational purposes only. The company paved the streets, provided electric street lights, installed sidewalks, and planted hundreds of trees along the streets of Leclaire. Later sections of Leclaire were laid out with a conventional grid design and smaller lots, but still included the deed restrictions.<br/><br/>A Leclaire Victorian cottage in 1907<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Initially the homes were built by the company and then sold at near cost to Nelson employees to encourage home ownership. If a worker became ill and could not make his mortgage, payments were suspended until after he returned to work. The homes were offered in a variety of house designs and the company advertised that no two dwellings were alike. The earliest homes were primarily Victorian cottages that came with electricity and running water. These were followed by bungalows, foursquares, and even some kit homes. Residents could purchase a company-built home or buy an empty lot and build a house themselves, provided the architectural design met company standards.<br/><br/>In later years, lots were sold to investors, usually Edwardsville residents, and many homes in the 1920s were built by local contractors who then sold them to area residents.<br/><br/>Education<br/><br/>Nelson believed in education for everyone, including the working class. Educational programming began with a kindergarten at the Club House in 1892 and continued in the new educational building at 722 Holyoake Road. Commonly called the "School House," this building provided a large hall for meetings and programs, but had moveable partitions to divide it into classroom space during the day. In the evenings, there were dances, meetings, or programs of the Leclaire Self-Culture Club which featured weekly lectures by Washington University professors or nationally known speakers who, like N. O. Nelson, were part of the social betterment movement at the turn of the century. These included Jane Addams, Edward Everett Hale, Samuel "Golden Rule" Jones, and author Charlotte Perkins Gilman, among others.<br/><br/>Children enrolled in the Leclaire kindergarten in 1913<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>In the ten years following the 1895 construction of the education building, there were a series of educational experiments including an industrial school, college, night school, and an academy. The earliest and longest-lived endeavor was the morning kindergarten, founded in 1892, that used the Fröbel Model. This two-year program was free to everyone, including Edwardsville children, until 1931 when for financial reasons the company began charging tuition to students who were not the children of employees. Nelson Manufacturing operated a kindergarten until 1934 when the building was turned over to the Edwardsville School District for a nominal fee.<br/><br/>Recreation<br/><br/>Boaters on Leclaire Lake in 1915<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Recreation was an important feature of Leclaire. The company provided sports facilities for baseball, tennis, and later, football. A bowling and billiard hall was constructed and there was a lake for boating, swimming, fishing, or ice skating in winter. Leclaire Park was furnished with boathouses, male & female bath houses, and a large pavilion. Residents organized dances, hayrides, spelling bees, and other activities, and the company sponsored a band that played regularly at entertainments in the village or in Edwardsville. Like the educational functions at the Club House and School House, the recreational facilities at Leclaire were open to all and were often a destination for Edwardsville and even St. Louis visitors.<br/><br/>Beauty<br/><br/>Early photograph of Leclaire Lake<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>The last of the factors Nelson deemed important for a satisfying life concerned the environment. Nelson knew about the importance of healthy living. He valued the beauty and cleanliness that could be found in the country, and encouraged all in Leclaire to beautify their property by planting gardens and orchards. Nelson himself led by example, so a company greenhouse provided free flowers and competitions were held for the most beautiful yards. Leclaire was laid out so that the entire village had a park-like setting still evident today.<br/><br/>Freedom<br/><br/>The Leclaire Cooperative store<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Nelson listed five founding principles for Leclaire, but modern writers add a sixth: Freedom. All of the programs offered by the company were available to employees as well as local residents, but none were mandatory. The freedom to choose whether or not to participate in company programs was entirely up to the individual. Residents of Leclaire could work for Nelson Manufacturing or elsewhere, and workers were under no obligation to live in Leclaire. Participation in recreational and educational programs was also optional. There was also a company store where employees could shop, but unlike other company towns, no one was in debt to the company store. The Leclaire Store was a cooperative where members were charged fair market prices, but were then paid quarterly dividends.<br/><br/>A Different Company Town<br/><br/>All of these benefits made Leclaire unique from other company towns. But there were also individual instances where the company showed compassion and care for the employees. The company closed the factories and hired excursion trains to take workers and their families to St. Louis for a day at the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair. When money was tight, Nelson would occasionally place extra cash in each pay envelope to make life easier for workers, and if he instituted a program the men did not agree with, they talked it out and, as often as not, Nelson would reverse himself.<br/><br/>Born in Lillesand, Norway, in 1841, N. O. Nelson was a complicated man. He was a capitalist who believed in free enterprise, but also a socialist, a follower of the "Golden Rule", and a patriot who served for the Union in the Civil War. By 1900, he was a multimillionaire, but by the time of his death in 1922, he had given it all away for the betterment of the working class.<br/><br/>Although Leclaire was not Nelson's only social experiment, it is considered his most successful endeavor. Other major efforts for social betterment included a chain of co-operative grocery stores in New Orleans, a kindergarten for the children of black employees in his Bessemer, Alabama, factories, and a home for consumptives in Indio, California.<br/><br/>Nelson's Village of Leclaire was renowned internationally as a noteworthy and successful experiment. It was described in the New York World on numerous occasions but in particular by reporter Nellie Bly in 1894 who wrote at length about the model town where "The labor question is solved and everybody happy in a little village near St. Louis." The Los Angeles Times also regularly reported on N. O. Nelson, as did the Chicago Daily Tribune and numerous other publications.<br/><br/>In a speech at Leclaire's 15th anniversary celebration in 1915, Nelson said, "Leclaire extends to you a wide open hospitality, and bids you enjoy today the ease and comfort and beauty and inspiration which we enjoy every day." More than a century has passed since that day, but the invitation still stands. Residents and researchers are invited to learn about Leclaire's history and consider the lessons that might be learned for the betterment of future generations.<br/><br/>One of the former buildings of the manufacturing complex in 2019, which now serves as the N. O. Nelson Campus of Lewis and Clark Community College<br/>Photo by Ben Ostermeier<br/><br/>Friends of Leclaire, organized in 1990 following Leclaire's Centennial celebration, promotes the history of Leclaire through a website (historic-leclaire.org), publications, and a festival, Leclaire Parkfest, held annually on the third Sunday in October | Leclaire<br/><br/>Det historiske Leclaire-kvarter, der engang blev omtalt som Edwardsvilles "forstad mod syd", blev grundlagt som et kooperativt samfund i 1890 og forblev en separat landsby, indtil den blev knyttet til byen Edwardsville i 1934. Aviser og blade i hele USA og Europa rapporterede om Leclaire-eksperimentet, især i de første 20 år af dets eksistens. I 1979, på grund af sin unikke historie, blev den tidligere landsby opført på National Register of Historic Places.<br/><br/>Leclaire blev grundlagt af Nelson Oliver Nelson, en St. Louis VVS-producent, der i mange år søgte at fremme arbejderklassens situation. Nelson ønskede at forbedre arbejdsvilkårene for sine medarbejdere og give boliger i nærheden af fabrikkerne, så arbejdere og deres familier nemt kunne deltage i rekreative og uddannelsesprogrammer, der tilbydes gratis af virksomheden. Før 1890, mens stadig i St. Louis, begyndte N. O. Nelson Companys produktions- og distributionsvirksomheder at give overskudsdeling sammen med uddannelsesmæssige og rekreative muligheder. Det kooperative Leclaire-eksperiment ville medføre yderligere fordele.<br/><br/>Da Nelsons medarbejdere indikerede, at de ønskede at flytte til et landligt sted, henvendte virksomhedsrepræsentanter sig til ledere af små byer i flere Missouri og Illinois-samfund i nærheden af deres St. Louis-hovedkvarter. De var på udkig efter en passende ejendom til at bygge nye fabrikker og en model landsby. Syd for Edwardsville fandt de en 125-acre område med adgang til vand, kul og transport. Lokale forretningsmænd handlede hurtigt for at tilbyde et økonomisk incitament. På mindre end tre uger rejste samfundet en fond på $ 20.000 fra individuelle bidrag på mellem $ 1 og $ 1.000 for at lokke Nelson til at vælge Edwardsville til sin virksomhed.<br/><br/>Byledere havde håbet at finde ejendom inden for Edwardsvilles bygrænse, men da der ikke kunne findes noget passende sted, var de overbeviste om, at Nelson-investeringen syd for byen snart ville blive en del af Edwardsville. Selvom Nelson opfyldt alle de uforudsete for byggeri og jobskabelse i sin kontrakt, ville det være 44 år før annektering til Edwardsville. Leclaire, afgrænset af Madison / Brown Avenues mod øst, jernbanesporene mod vest, Hadley / McKinley Avenues mod syd og Wolf Street mod nord, forblev en uafhængig landsby fra 1890 til 1934. I løbet af den tid tjente det et ry for innovationer inden for erhvervslivet, uddannelse og boligplanlægning.<br/><br/>Landsbyen Leclaire på et kort fra 1931 over Edwardsville<br/>Med tilladelse af Paul Jenkins<br/><br/>Nelsons beslutning om at bygge en landsby blev ikke truffet på et indfald. Ved slutningen af 1880'erne var han en international leder inden for samarbejde og profit-deling, udveksle sociale teorier med andre rundt om i verden, mens udvide sin St. Louis forretning. Han opkaldte sin eksperimentelle landsby efter den parisiske profit-sharer, Edme Jean Leclaire, men han besøgte mange andre sociale visionære, der gav information og inspiration. Nelson sammensatte de bedste ideer fra disse eksempler og grundlagde Leclaire for med sine ord at "give arbejde, fremme intelligens, give rekreation, fremme skønhed og skabe hjem." Det var alle faktorer, han fandt nødvendige for, at mænd kunne føre tilfredsstillende liv. Senere forfattere brugte disse ord til at formulere Leclaires grundlæggende principper: Arbejde, hjem, uddannelse, rekreation og skønhed, men med det yderligere vigtige princip om frihed.<br/><br/>Arbejde<br/><br/>Arbejde kan betragtes som den vigtigste af disse faktorer, da der uden fabrikken arbejdspladser i Leclaire, ville der ikke være nogen landsby. Bygningerne på teglværket blev designet af arkitekten E. A. Cameron for at give naturligt lys, ventilation om sommeren og gulvvarme om vinteren. Der var et brandslukningssystem, og selv om arbejdsulykker ikke blev elimineret, blev der gjort alt for at garantere arbejdstagernes sikkerhed. De murstensbelagte murstensbygninger var omgivet af velplejede græsplæner og blomsterhaver, der gav komplekset et campus-lignende udseende. I 1894 kaldte New York World reporter Nellie Bly bygningerne "den ideelle perfektion af bygninger for mennesket at arbejde i".<br/><br/>Produktionskomplekset af N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company i Leclaire<br/>Venner af Leclaire<br/><br/>Nelson virksomhedspolitikker var designet til at beskytte medarbejdernes finansielle stabilitet. Arbejdere kunne tjene en del af overskuddet og have en stemme i virksomheden, hvis de valgte den mulighed. Profitdelingsplanen gav Nelson-ansatte en stolthed af ejerskab, der resulterede i en støttende arbejdsstyrke. Der var et par kortvarige strejker i årenes løb, men for det meste var arbejdsproblemer sjældne. Arbejdstagerne havde også rimelige timer og konkurrencedygtige lønninger. Der var en provident fond, der tilvejebragte pensioner og sygefravær samt enkepensioner, hvis en arbejdstager døde, uanset om dødsfaldet var relateret til hans beskæftigelse.<br/><br/>Virksomhedens hovedkvarter for N. O. Nelson Company (NONCO) forblev i St. Louis, men hele N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company blev flyttet til Leclaire. Fremstillingsvirksomheden blev opdelt i butikker, der lavede en række produkter. I 1900 blev butikkerne selvstændige selskaber til skattemæssige formål, men alle var stadig ejet af N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company. Butikkerne omfattede Cabinet Mill, hvor træprodukter fra kabinet til mølleværk blev produceret. De dygtige håndværkere, der arbejdede her, opfyldte også særlige kontrakter, herunder kassererbure til en lokal bank og et alter, der stadig er i brug ved St. Andrew's Episcopal Church i Edwardsville. Marble Shop specialiseret i arkitektonisk marmor, der blev skåret og installeret af Nelson besætninger i boliger, virksomheder og endda statslige kapitæler i hele Midtvesten. Maskinværkstedet, som blev Bignall og Keeler, lavede rørmonteringsmaskiner, pumper, målere og forskellige mekaniske værktøjer, der forventes i VVS-handelen. De forgrenede sig også for at fremstille specialvarer som Leclaire-cyklen i midten af 1890'erne. Messingværkstedet omfattede et støberi, hvor forskellige VVS-rør og værktøjer blev fremstillet. Disse eksempler repræsenterer blot nogle af det arbejde, der blev udført i Leclaire fabrikkerne. Virksomhedens logo var en stiliseret "NONCO", der stadig kan ses på VVS-armaturer og nogle brandhaner i Edwardsville i dag.<br/><br/>Boliger<br/><br/>Før boliger kunne bygges, var boliger nødvendige for arbejdere, der færdiggjorde fabriksbygningerne samt bygge boliger. For at imødekomme disse behov byggede virksomheden "Club House", en stor bygning, der tjente mange formål. Ud over logi var det samfundets første uddannelsesbygning, og den indeholdt et velassorteret bibliotek.<br/><br/>Opførelsen af beboelsesdelen af Leclaire begyndte umiddelbart efter, at landsbyen blev grundlagt i juni 1890. Julius Pitzman, den innovative landskabsarkitekt, der lagde de første partier i Leclaire, satte dem op med en række beskyttende pagter. Pagterne forudsat for brede, krumme gader, store partier, og en gerning begrænsning, der begrænsede ejendommene til bolig eller uddannelsesmæssige formål. Virksomheden brolagt gaderne, forudsat elektrisk gadebelysning, installeret fortove, og plantet hundredvis af træer langs gaderne i Leclaire. Senere sektioner af Leclaire blev lagt ud med en konventionel gitter design og mindre partier, men stadig omfattede skøde restriktioner.<br/><br/>En Leclaire victoriansk sommerhus i 1907<br/>af Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Oprindeligt blev boligerne bygget af virksomheden og derefter solgt til næsten omkostninger til Nelson-medarbejdere for at tilskynde til boligejerskab. Hvis en arbejder blev syg og ikke kunne gøre sit realkreditlån, blev betalingerne suspenderet, indtil han vendte tilbage til arbejde. Boligerne blev tilbudt i en række forskellige husdesigns, og virksomheden annoncerede, at ikke to boliger var ens. De tidligste boliger var primært victorianske hytter, der fulgte med elektricitet og rindende vand. Disse blev efterfulgt af bungalows, foursquares og endda nogle kit hjem. Beboerne kunne købe et firma-bygget hjem eller købe en tom masse og bygge et hus selv, forudsat at det arkitektoniske design opfyldte virksomhedens standarder.<br/><br/>I de senere år, blev masser solgt til investorer, normalt Edwardsville beboere, og mange boliger i 1920'erne blev bygget af lokale entreprenører, der derefter solgte dem til området beboere.<br/><br/>Uddannelse<br/><br/>Nelson troede på uddannelse for alle, herunder arbejderklassen. Uddannelsesprogrammering begyndte med en børnehave i klubhuset i 1892 og fortsatte i den nye uddannelsesbygning på 722 Holyoake Road. Almindeligvis kaldet "School House", denne bygning forudsat en stor hal for møder og programmer, men havde bevægelige skillevægge til at opdele det i klasseværelset plads i løbet af dagen. Om aftenen var der danse, møder eller programmer i Leclaire Self-Culture Club, som indeholdt ugentlige foredrag af Washington University professorer eller nationalt kendte højttalere, der ligesom N. O. Nelson, var en del af den sociale forbedringsbevægelse ved århundredeskiftet. Disse omfattede Jane Addams, Edward Everett Hale, Samuel "Golden Rule" Jones, og forfatter Charlotte Perkins Gilman, blandt andre.<br/><br/>Børn indskrevet i Leclaire børnehave i 1913<br/>af Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>I de ti år efter 1895 opførelsen af uddannelsesbygningen var der en række pædagogiske eksperimenter, herunder en industriskole, kollegium, natskole og et akademi. Den tidligste og længstlevende bestræbelse var morgenbørnehaven, der blev grundlagt i 1892, der brugte Fröbel-modellen. Dette toårige program var gratis for alle, herunder Edwardsville børn, indtil 1931, da virksomheden af økonomiske årsager begyndte at opkræve undervisning til studerende, der ikke var børn af medarbejdere. Nelson Manufacturing drev en børnehave indtil 1934, hvor bygningen blev overdraget til Edwardsville School District for et nominelt gebyr.<br/><br/>Rekreation<br/><br/>Sejlere på Leclaire Lake i 1915<br/>af Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Rekreation var et vigtigt træk ved Leclaire. Virksomheden leverede sportsfaciliteter til baseball, tennis og senere fodbold. En bowling- og billardhal blev bygget, og der var en sø til sejlads, svømning, fiskeri eller skøjteløb om vinteren. Leclaire Park blev indrettet med bådehuse, mandlige og kvindelige badehuse og en stor pavillon. Beboerne organiserede danse, hayrides, stave bier og andre aktiviteter, og selskabet sponsorerede et band, der spillede regelmæssigt på underholdning i landsbyen eller i Edwardsville. Ligesom de pædagogiske funktioner på Club House og School House, de rekreative faciliteter på Leclaire var åbne for alle og var ofte en destination for Edwardsville og selv St. Louis besøgende.<br/><br/>Skønhed<br/><br/>Billeder af Leclaire Lake<br/>af Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Den sidste af de faktorer Nelson anså for vigtige for et tilfredsstillende liv vedrørte miljøet. Nelson vidste om vigtigheden af et sundt liv. Han værdsatte den skønhed og renlighed, der kunne findes i landet, og opfordrede alle i Leclaire til at forskønne deres ejendom ved at plante haver og frugtplantager. Nelson selv var et eksempel, så et firma drivhus forudsat gratis blomster og konkurrencer blev afholdt for de smukkeste værfter. Leclaire blev lagt ud, så hele landsbyen havde en park-lignende indstilling stadig tydeligt i dag.<br/><br/>Frihed<br/><br/>Den Leclaire Cooperative butik<br/>af Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Nelson nævnte fem grundlæggende principper for Leclaire, men moderne forfattere tilføjer en sjette: Frihed. Alle de programmer, der tilbydes af virksomheden, var tilgængelige for medarbejdere såvel som lokale beboere, men ingen var obligatoriske. Friheden til at vælge, om man vil deltage i virksomhedens programmer, var helt op til den enkelte. Beboere i Leclaire kunne arbejde for Nelson Manufacturing eller andre steder, og arbejdstagere var ikke forpligtet til at bo i Leclaire. Deltagelse i rekreative og uddannelsesmæssige programmer var også valgfri. Der var også en firmabutik, hvor medarbejderne kunne shoppe, men i modsætning til andre firmabyer var ingen i gæld til firmabutikken. Leclaire Store var et kooperativ, hvor medlemmerne blev opkrævet fair markedspriser, men blev derefter udbetalt kvartalsvise udbytter.<br/><br/>En anden virksomhedsby<br/><br/>Alle disse fordele gjorde Leclaire unik fra andre firmabyer. Men der var også individuelle tilfælde, hvor virksomheden viste medfølelse og omsorg for medarbejderne. Virksomheden lukkede fabrikkerne og hyrede udflugtstog til at tage arbejdere og deres familier til St. Louis for en dag på 1904 St. Louis World's Fair. Når pengene var stramme, ville Nelson lejlighedsvis lægge ekstra kontanter i hver lønkuvert for at gøre livet lettere for arbejderne, og hvis han indførte et program, som mændene ikke var enige i, talte de det ud, og så ofte som ikke, ville Nelson vende sig selv.<br/><br/>Født i Lillesand, Norge, i 1841, N. O. Nelson var en kompliceret mand. Han var en kapitalist, der troede på fri virksomhed, men også en socialist, en tilhænger af "Golden Rule", og en patriot, der tjente for Unionen i borgerkrigen. I 1900 var han multimillionær, men da han døde i 1922, havde han givet det hele væk til gavn for arbejderklassen.<br/><br/>Selvom Leclaire ikke var Nelsons eneste sociale eksperiment, betragtes det som hans mest succesfulde bestræbelse. Andre store bestræbelser for social forbedring omfattede en kæde af kooperative købmandsforretninger i New Orleans, en børnehave for børn af sorte medarbejdere i hans Bessemer, Alabama, fabrikker og et hjem for forbrugsvarer i Indio, Californien.<br/><br/>Nelson's Village of Leclaire var internationalt kendt som et bemærkelsesværdigt og vellykket eksperiment. Det blev beskrevet i New York World ved talrige lejligheder, men især af reporter Nellie Bly i 1894, der skrev udførligt om den model by, hvor "Arbejderspørgsmålet er løst og alle glade i en lille landsby nær St. Louis." Los Angeles Times rapporterede også regelmæssigt om N. O. Nelson, ligesom Chicago Daily Tribune og mange andre publikationer.<br/><br/>I en tale ved Leclaires 15 års jubilæum i 1915, sagde Nelson, "Leclaire udvider til dig en bred åben gæstfrihed, og byder dig nyde i dag lethed og komfort og skønhed og inspiration, som vi nyder hver dag." Mere end et århundrede er gået siden den dag, men invitationen står stadig. Beboere og forskere inviteres til at lære om Leclaires historie og overveje de lektioner, der kan læres til gavn for fremtidige generationer.<br/><br/>En af de tidligere bygninger i produktionskomplekset i 2019, der nu fungerer som N.

| Author Visits via Zoom or Skype<br/><br/>I'm excited to visit with your students via Zoom or Skype! Skype is a great option for schools/classes who aren't bringing in in-person authors, but who want to explore books and poetry, connect with an author, and ask one-on-one questions.<br/><br/>Cost<br/><br/>I offer 30-45-minute Zoom or Skype visits with schools for $125 per session (or $200 for two sessions happening within three hours in the morning or the afternoon; $325 for three sessions in one day; $425 for four sessions in one day). In each session, I try to get kids as actively involved as possible. No, it's not the same kind of connection as an in-person visit offers, but it can still be inspiring and motivating for kids!<br/><br/>What I Do<br/><br/>Each session for up to 50 students includes:<br/><br/>5 minutes of tech set-up<br/><br/>3 segments of 10ish-minutes each — You choose from:<br/><br/>How I became a writer<br/><br/>Writing this particular book (you choose which book I focus on)<br/><br/>Reading (I read some poems and kids help me read others)<br/><br/>Classroom presentation (your students put on a reading or performance for me—a very appreciative audience!)<br/><br/>Writing a poem together<br/><br/>Question and answer session<br/><br/>5 minutes of wrap-ups/goodbyes<br/><br/>I also chat with classes of pre-service teachers or groups of in-service teachers about poetry and writing.<br/><br/>Tips for a Great Virtual Visit<br/><br/>Tips for a Successful Virtual Visit<br/><br/>One of my goals for virtual school visits is to capture the interactivity that makes in-person visits successful and fun. But the truth is that sometimes it's tough to be virtually interactive! The timing might not sync up correctly, which makes reading together a challenge, and it's really hard for me to hear individual students unless they come up and speak directly into the microphone/computer. But after some trial and error, I've discovered some ways to have the best virtual visits possible. Here they are: 10 ways to make my visit with your students a great experience!<br/><br/>Before the Visit<br/><br/>Get kids as excited as possible about the visit. Visit my website with them. Read some of my books with them. Gather some questions students have for me. Anything you do ahead of time to make it feel like a BIG DEAL will go a long way toward student engagement.<br/><br/>Position the video camera or laptop with webcam so that I can see as much of the audience as possible. It's hard to assess student engagement when I can only see a couple of students.<br/><br/>Limit each group to 50 students. It's incredibly hard to engage large groups via video.<br/><br/>I'll move quickly from topic to topic or poem to poem. Please remind students that they'll need to listen closely to understand what's going on.<br/><br/>Occasionally, I do a little Reader's Theater with students. If I send you any scripted student parts ahead of time, print a copy for EACH session and cut into pieces, if needed.<br/><br/>During the Visit<br/><br/>When I discuss a book, if you have that printed book, please hold it up for students to see.<br/><br/>You are my proxy. I often can't call on students and hear individual replies. So, I might say, "We're going to get 3 ideas. Raise your hand if you have an idea." Then YOU take over, call on three students, and announce those answers to everyone in the room and to me.<br/><br/>Choose confident, outgoing students for scripted student parts (if I send any ahead of time). During my in-person school visits, I try to draw out some of the less confident students, but I've found that this doesn't work as well during virtual visits because I can't hear them.<br/><br/>Have students with speaking parts sit up front. When it's time, have them stand up and remind them to speak loudly.<br/><br/>In virtual visits, behavior management falls solely on you. I often can't see exactly what's going on, so do please step in as needed. If there's a big disruption, just ask me to hold on for a moment so that I don't chatter on while nobody's paying attention:>)<br/><br/>Feel free to take pictures of me on-screen and share on social media–even though pictures of me often look ridiculous because I'm making funny faces or something while I read!<br/><br/>If you have any questions at all, please just ask, either before or during the visit!<br/><br/>Scheduling a Virtual Session<br/><br/>Are you interested in scheduling a virtual visit with me? Just email me to set up a date, and we'll go from there | Forfatterbesøg via Zoom eller Skype<br/><br/>Jeg glæder mig til at besøge dine elever via Zoom eller Skype! Skype er en fantastisk mulighed for skoler / klasser, der ikke bringer i personlige forfattere, men som ønsker at udforske bøger og poesi, forbinde med en forfatter og stille en-til-en-spørgsmål.<br/><br/>Omkostninger<br/><br/>Jeg tilbyder 30-45 minutters Zoom eller Skype besøg med skoler for $ 125 per session (eller $ 200 for to sessioner, der sker inden for tre timer om morgenen eller eftermiddagen; $ 325 for tre sessioner på en dag; $ 425 for fire sessioner på en dag). I hver session forsøger jeg at få børn så aktivt involveret som muligt. Nej, det er ikke den samme slags forbindelse som et personligt besøg tilbud, men det kan stadig være inspirerende og motiverende for børn!<br/><br/>Hvad jeg gør<br/><br/>Hver session for op til 50 studerende omfatter:<br/><br/>5 minutter af tech set-up<br/><br/>3 segmenter af 10ish-minutter hver - Du vælger mellem:<br/><br/>Hvordan jeg blev forfatter<br/><br/>Skrive denne særlige bog (du vælger hvilken bog jeg fokuserer på)<br/><br/>Læsning (jeg læser nogle digte og børn hjælper mig med at læse andre)<br/><br/>Klasseværelse præsentation (dine elever sætte på en læsning eller præstation for mig-en meget påskønnende publikum!)<br/><br/>Skriv et digt sammen<br/><br/>Spørgsmål og svar session<br/><br/>5 minutter af wrap-ups / farvel<br/><br/>Jeg chatter også med klasser af præ-service lærere eller grupper af in-service lærere om poesi og skrivning.<br/><br/>Tips til et stort virtuelt besøg<br/><br/>Tips til et vellykket virtuelt besøg<br/><br/>Et af mine mål for virtuelle skolebesøg er at fange den interaktivitet, der gør personlige besøg succesfulde og sjove. Men sandheden er, at det nogle gange er svært at være næsten interaktiv! Timingen synkroniseres måske ikke korrekt, hvilket gør læsning sammen til en udfordring, og det er virkelig svært for mig at høre individuelle elever, medmindre de kommer op og taler direkte ind i mikrofonen / computeren. Men efter nogle forsøg og fejl, Jeg har opdaget nogle måder at have de bedste virtuelle besøg muligt. Her er de: 10 måder at gøre mit besøg med dine elever en stor oplevelse!<br/><br/>Før besøget<br/><br/>Få børn så begejstret som muligt om besøget. Besøg min hjemmeside med dem. Læs nogle af mine bøger med dem. Saml nogle spørgsmål studerende har for mig. Alt, hvad du gør på forhånd for at få det til at føles som en stor aftale, vil gå langt i retning af studerendes engagement.<br/><br/>Placer videokameraet eller den bærbare computer med webcam, så jeg kan se så meget af publikum som muligt. Det er svært at vurdere elevernes engagement, når jeg kun kan se et par studerende.<br/><br/>Begræns hver gruppe til 50 elever. Det er utroligt svært at engagere store grupper via video.<br/><br/>Jeg bevæger mig hurtigt fra emne til emne eller digt til digt. Mind eleverne om, at de skal lytte nøje for at forstå, hvad der foregår.<br/><br/>Lejlighedsvis laver jeg en lille Reader's Theater med studerende. Hvis jeg sender dig nogen scriptede elevdele i forvejen, skal du udskrive en kopi til hver session og skære i stykker, hvis det er nødvendigt.<br/><br/>Under besøget<br/><br/>Når jeg diskuterer en bog, hvis du har den trykte bog, skal du holde den op for eleverne at se.<br/><br/>Du er min stedfortræder. Jeg kan ofte ikke ringe til elever og høre individuelle svar. Så jeg kan sige, "Vi får 3 ideer. Ræk hånden op, hvis du har en idé." Så tager du over, kalder på tre studerende og meddeler disse svar til alle i rummet og til mig.<br/><br/>Vælg selvsikre, udgående studerende til scriptede elevdele (hvis jeg sender nogen forud for tid). Under mine personlige skolebesøg forsøger jeg at tegne nogle af de mindre selvsikre elever, men jeg har fundet ud af, at dette ikke fungerer så godt under virtuelle besøg, fordi jeg ikke kan høre dem.<br/><br/>Få elever med taledele til at sidde foran. Når det er tid, skal de rejse sig og minde dem om at tale højt.<br/><br/>I virtuelle besøg falder adfærdsstyring udelukkende på dig. Jeg kan ofte ikke se præcis, hvad der foregår, så vær venlig at træde ind efter behov. Hvis der er en stor forstyrrelse, bare bede mig om at holde på et øjeblik, så jeg ikke chatter på, mens ingen er opmærksomme:>)<br/><br/>Du er velkommen til at tage billeder af mig på skærmen og dele på sociale medier - selvom billeder af mig ofte ser latterlige ud, fordi jeg laver sjove ansigter eller noget, mens jeg læser!<br/><br/>Hvis du har spørgsmål, så spørg venligst, enten før eller under besøget!<br/><br/>Planlægning af en virtuel session<br/><br/>Er du interesseret i at planlægge et virtuelt besøg med mig? Bare email mig for at oprette en dato, og vi vil gå derfra |

On the one hand it has prompted stigma and violence and on the other it has brought about constructive and supportive responses from various individuals and groups. A new book, Acting on HIV, edited by Prof. Dennis Francis, Dean of the Faculty of Education at the University of the Free State, looks at how drama can be used to promote vital social change as well as individual behavioural change.<br/><br/>Acting on HIV offers a systematic inquiry into drama as an approach to discuss HIV/AIDS and related attitudes and behaviours. The book is a scholarly text and includes the work of some twenty exceptionally creative authors. Contributing authors to the book include, amongst others, Proff. Hazel Barnes (University of the Witwatersrand), Rob Pattman (Stellenbosch University) and Yvonne Sliep from the University of KwaZulu-Natal.<br/><br/>"This project started in 2009 and has taken much of my time to bring together the work of exceptionally creative authors. The research that is communicated through the book is original and timely and makes a significant contribution to conversations about the role/s and significance of drama in addressing issues of HIV & AIDS," says Prof. Francis | Nyhedsarkiv<br/><br/>Ny bog ser på måder at tackle hiv-udfordringer på<br/><br/>Udgivelser 2011-11-29<br/><br/>Prof. Dennis Francis med Marjorie Human, der har designet forsiden af bogen, Acting on HIV.<br/><br/>Hiv-pandemien har bragt det bedste og værste frem i mennesker med hensyn til respons. På den ene side har den fremkaldt stigmatisering og vold, og på den anden side har den medført konstruktive og støttende reaktioner fra forskellige individer og grupper. En ny bog, Acting on HIV, redigeret af Prof. Dennis Francis, dekan for Det Pædagogiske Fakultet ved Fristatens Universitet, ser på, hvordan drama kan bruges til at fremme vitale sociale forandringer såvel som individuelle adfærdsændringer.<br/><br/>Acting on HIV tilbyder en systematisk undersøgelse af drama som en tilgang til at diskutere HIV / AIDS og relaterede holdninger og adfærd. Bogen er en videnskabelig tekst og omfatter arbejdet i nogle tyve usædvanligt kreative forfattere. Bidragende forfattere til bogen omfatter bl.a. Proff. Hazel Barnes (Witwatersrand Universitet), Rob Pattman (Stellenbosch Universitet) og Yvonne Sliep fra University of KwaZulu-Natal.<br/><br/>"Dette projekt startede i 2009 og har taget meget af min tid til at samle arbejdet med usædvanligt kreative forfattere. Den forskning, der formidles gennem bogen, er original og rettidig og yder et væsentligt bidrag til samtaler om dramaets rolle / s og betydning for at løse problemer med hiv og aids, "siger professor Francis. |

| Real Estate Word of the Day: Option<br/><br/>Option: An agreement to keep open, for a set period, an offer to sell or lease real property. An option can be used, for example, to give the buyer time to resolve questions of financing, title, zoning and feasibility before committing the buyer to purchase. Options are frequently used in the land assemblage process. The option must be supported by its actual consideration, separate and independent of the purchase price of the property. Mere recital of consideration alone is not sufficient except in a lease-option in which the provisions of the lease are themselves sufficient consideration to support the option. An option merely creates a contractual right; it does not give the optionee any estate in the property. At the time the option is signed, the owner does not sell, nor does the buyer purchase, the property. Although the owner is obligated to sell if given notice by the buyer, the buyer is not obligated to purchase. An option to buy is also known as a call; an option to sell is known as a put. | Real Estate ord af dagen: Mulighed<br/><br/>Mulighed: En aftale om at holde åben, i en bestemt periode, et tilbud om at sælge eller lease fast ejendom. En mulighed kan for eksempel bruges til at give køberen tid til at løse spørgsmål om finansiering, titel, zoneinddeling og gennemførlighed, før køberen forpligter sig til at købe. Optioner bruges ofte i jordmonteringsprocessen. Optionen skal understøttes af dens faktiske vederlag, separat og uafhængig af ejendommens købspris. En simpel betragtning alene er ikke tilstrækkelig, undtagen i en lejekontrakt, hvor lejekontraktens bestemmelser i sig selv er tilstrækkelige til at understøtte denne mulighed. En option skaber blot en kontraktlig ret; det giver ikke optionen nogen ejendom i ejendommen. På det tidspunkt, hvor optionen er underskrevet, sælger ejeren ikke, og køberen køber heller ikke ejendommen. Selv om ejeren er forpligtet til at sælge, hvis givet varsel fra køberen, er køberen ikke forpligtet til at købe. En option til at købe er også kendt som et opkald; en option til at sælge er kendt som en put. |
| Benefits of Carotenoids for the Skin<br/><br/>Have you heard of carotenoids? These powerful phytochemicals are the pigmented constituents found in plants that give flowers, fruits, and leaves their yellow, orange and red colours.<br/><br/>Since the 1930s, scientists have identified about 800 carotenoids and about 40 are found in the human body, including the outermost layer of the epidermis, the dermis and subcutaneous fat. The most common carotenoids are beta-carotene, alpha-carotene, lutein, zeaxanthin, lycopene, and astaxanthin. You can read more about astaxanthin here.<br/><br/>The content of carotenoids in the skin is influenced by numerous factors, including the intake of fruits and vegetables, their bioavailability from various foods, supplementation, exposure to UV radiation, air pollution, alcohol consumption, smoking and stress.<br/><br/>How do Carotenoids Help My Skin?<br/><br/>Carotenoids are some of the best-known antioxidants for the skin and they also have important functions as anti-inflammatory agents.<br/><br/>Healthy Aging and Skin Repair<br/><br/>Antioxidants are essential for healthy skin because they help to prevent free radical damage to cells. Free radical damage causes premature aging and the onset of various types of skin cancers. Carotenoids, along with vitamin E, vitamin C, and Co enzyme Q10 are important dermal antioxidants.<br/><br/>Due to their antioxidant activity, carotenoids support and encourage collagen and elastin production in the skin. This helps to increase the skin's density, thickness, elasticity, and firmness. Collagen and elastin decrease as we age, so getting enough carotenoids in the diet and topically is critical for aging well.<br/><br/>Carotenoids can improve the signs of photoaging, skin discolouration, elasticity, hydration, texture, and can reduce transepidermal water loss.<br/><br/>Astaxanthin in particular stimulates fibroblasts to produce collagen and elastin, inhibits the activity of the enzymes that breakdown collagen and elastin, and shows anti-inflammatory and UV-filtering effects. It has been shown to reduce melanin in the skin, which results in the decrease in the appearance of freckles and melasma.<br/><br/>Anti-acne activity: the anti-inflammatory activity of carotenoids helps to dampen the inflammation and irritation associated with acne. Carotenoids also help to normalize and balance oil secretions from the sebaceous glands. They are valuable agents in skin repair and they stimulate epidermal regeneration, helping to smooth and soften skin.<br/><br/>Where Can I Find Carotenoids?<br/><br/>There are two ways to get your daily dose of carotenoids: through diet and through topical application. The combination of both is the ideal approach to well-aging skincare.<br/><br/>Carotenoids are fat-soluble, so your body needs fat to absorb them (think tomatoes and olive oil, broccoli and butter, or spinach and avocado). Common sources of carotenoids in food are avocado, egg yolks, kale, spinach, carrots, sweet potatoes, papaya, and tomatoes.<br/><br/>While we advocate getting as many of your nutrients and antioxidants as you can from food rather than supplementation; one study showed that astaxanthin combined with collagen hydrolysate significantly improved barrier integrity, reduced transepidermal water loss, and increased the expression of procollagen type I mRNA.<br/><br/>Topical application is key to healthy skin. Studies show that high concentrations of antioxidants in human skin offer the best protection for healthy skin at any age.<br/><br/>At Sarka Botanicals, we blend carotenoid-rich, whole plants such as calendula, dandelion, and extracts like astaxanthin with cold-pressed oils and functional ingredients. Calendula alone contains over 19 different types of carotenoids. This may explain why it has such a long history of use in skin care. Studies show that carotenoids blended with co-enzyme Q10 are especially effective at reducing inflammation and slowing premature skin aging due to sun exposure. | Fordele ved carotenoider til huden<br/><br/>Har du hørt om carotenoider? Disse kraftfulde fytokemikalier er de pigmenterede bestanddele, der findes i planter, der giver blomster, frugter og efterlader deres gule, orange og røde farver.<br/><br/>Siden 1930'erne har forskere identificeret omkring 800 carotenoider og omkring 40 findes i den menneskelige krop, herunder det yderste lag af epidermis, dermis og subkutant fedt. De mest almindelige carotenoider er beta-caroten, alfa-caroten, lutein, zeaxanthin, lycopen og astaxanthin. Du kan læse mere om astaxanthin her.<br/><br/>Indholdet af carotenoider i huden påvirkes af mange faktorer, herunder indtag af frugt og grøntsager, deres biotilgængelighed fra forskellige fødevarer, tilskud, udsættelse for UV-stråling, luftforurening, alkoholforbrug, rygning og stress.<br/><br/>Hvordan hjælper carotenoider min hud?<br/><br/>Carotenoider er nogle af de mest kendte antioxidanter for huden, og de har også vigtige funktioner som antiinflammatoriske midler.<br/><br/>Sund aldring og hud reparation<br/><br/>Antioxidanter er afgørende for en sund hud, fordi de hjælper med at forhindre frie radikaler skader på celler. Frie radikaler skader forårsager for tidlig aldring og udbrud af forskellige typer af hudkræft. Carotenoider, sammen med E-vitamin, C-vitamin og Co-enzym Q10 er vigtige dermale antioxidanter.<br/><br/>På grund af deres antioxidant aktivitet, carotenoider støtte og tilskynde kollagen og elastin produktion i huden. Dette hjælper med at øge hudens tæthed, tykkelse, elasticitet og fasthed. Kollagen og elastin falder som vi alder, så at få nok carotenoider i kosten og topisk er afgørende for aldring godt.<br/><br/>Carotenoider kan forbedre tegn på fotoaging, misfarvning af huden, elasticitet, hydrering, tekstur og kan reducere transepidermalt vandtab.<br/><br/>Astaxanthin stimulerer især fibroblaster til at producere kollagen og elastin, hæmmer aktiviteten af de enzymer, der nedbryder kollagen og elastin, og viser antiinflammatoriske og UV-filtrerende virkninger. Det har vist sig at reducere melanin i huden, hvilket resulterer i et fald i forekomsten af fregner og melasma.<br/><br/>Anti-acne aktivitet: Den anti-inflammatoriske aktivitet af carotenoider hjælper med at dæmpe inflammation og irritation forbundet med acne. Carotenoider hjælper også med at normalisere og balancere oliesekret fra talgkirtlerne. De er værdifulde midler i hudreparation, og de stimulerer epidermal regenerering, der hjælper med at glatte og blødgøre huden.<br/><br/>Hvor kan jeg finde carotenoider?<br/><br/>Der er to måder at få din daglige dosis af carotenoider: gennem kost og gennem topisk anvendelse. Kombinationen af begge er den ideelle tilgang til godt aldrende hudpleje.<br/><br/>Carotenoider er fedtopløselige, så din krop har brug for fedt til at absorbere dem (tænk tomater og olivenolie, broccoli og smør eller spinat og avocado). Almindelige kilder til carotenoider i fødevarer er avocado, æggeblommer, grønkål, spinat, gulerødder, søde kartofler, papaya og tomater.<br/><br/>Mens vi anbefaler at få så mange af dine næringsstoffer og antioxidanter, som du kan fra mad snarere end tilskud, viste en undersøgelse, at astaxanthin kombineret med kollagenhydrolysat signifikant forbedrede barriereintegriteten, reducerede transepidermalt vandtab og øgede ekspressionen af prokollagen type I mRNA.<br/><br/>Aktuel anvendelse er nøglen til sund hud. Undersøgelser viser, at høje koncentrationer af antioxidanter i menneskelig hud giver den bedste beskyttelse for sund hud i alle aldre.<br/><br/>Hos Sarka Botanicals blander vi carotenoidrige, hele planter som calendula, mælkebøtte og ekstrakter som astaxanthin med koldpressede olier og funktionelle ingredienser. Calendula alene indeholder over 19 forskellige typer carotenoider. Dette kan forklare, hvorfor det har en så lang historie af brug i hudpleje. Undersøgelser viser, at carotenoider blandet med co-enzym Q10 er særligt effektive til at reducere inflammation og bremse for tidlig ældning af huden på grund af soleksponering. |
