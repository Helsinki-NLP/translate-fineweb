| Sleep Clinic<br/><br/>The sleep disorders program evaluates and treats children and adults affected by sleep-related problems such as insomnia, sleep apnea, narcolepsy and other hypersomnias, parasomnias and night time enuresis. The residents see patients during sleep disorders clinic hours.<br/><br/>During this rotation, the residents are exposed to a wide variety of sleep disorders. They are trained to investigate and evaluate their own patient care experiences pertaining to sleep evaluations with appraisal and assimilation of current scientific evidence. The residents work closely with sleep disorder faculty physicians and acquire the skills to formulate and communicate with patients and families about their diagnostic assessment and management plan, including neuropharmacology. Providing care plans to other physicians and care providers either verbally or via letter/note is an integral part of the program. | Søvnklinik<br/><br/>Søvnforstyrrelsesprogrammet evaluerer og behandler børn og voksne, der er ramt af søvnrelaterede problemer som søvnløshed, søvnapnø, narkolepsi og andre hypersomnier, parasomnier og natlig enuresis. Beboerne ser patienter under søvnforstyrrelser klinik timer.<br/><br/>Under denne rotation udsættes beboerne for en bred vifte af søvnforstyrrelser. De er uddannet til at undersøge og evaluere deres egne patientpleje erfaringer vedrørende søvn evalueringer med vurdering og assimilering af aktuelle videnskabelige beviser. Beboerne arbejder tæt sammen med søvnforstyrrelsesfakultetslæger og erhverver færdigheder til at formulere og kommunikere med patienter og familier om deres diagnostiske vurdering og ledelsesplan, herunder neurofarmakologi. At give plejeplaner til andre læger og plejeudbydere enten verbalt eller via brev / note er en integreret del af programmet. |
| Truly Handsfree Bluetooth Headset Takes Voice Commands<br/><br/>Most Bluetooth headsets are perfectly capable of the voice dial thing, assuming that the connected mobile phone can do it, but the BlueAnt V1 takes voice control to a new high. The incredibly compact Bluetooth headset is being marketed as the first ever with a true voice-based user interface.<br/><br/>Instead of clicking a physical button to answer your calls, you simply speak into the microphone and say "accept call". Other basic voice commands could include "volume up", "reject call", or "do the laundry". Okay, maybe it won't do that last thing, but you can see how a completely handsfree experience like that offered by the BlueAnt V1 can be excellent for drivers and other people who need their hands. That is why you're using a Bluetooth headset in the first place.<br/><br/>The downside is that the voice control can be "wonky" and it can be quite frustrating when you accidentally give it a command that you don't want it to do. What happens if you're in a call with someone and you happens to say "end call"? | Virkelig håndfri Bluetooth Headset tager stemmekommandoer<br/><br/>De fleste Bluetooth-headsets er perfekt i stand til taleopkald ting, forudsat at den tilsluttede mobiltelefon kan gøre det, men BlueAnt V1 tager stemmestyring til et nyt højdepunkt. Det utroligt kompakte Bluetooth-headset markedsføres som det første nogensinde med en ægte stemmebaseret brugergrænseflade.<br/><br/>I stedet for at klikke på en fysisk knap for at besvare dine opkald, taler du blot ind i mikrofonen og siger "accepter opkald". Andre grundlæggende stemmekommandoer kan omfatte "volumen op", "afvis opkald" eller "gør vasketøjet". Okay, måske vil det ikke gøre det sidste, men du kan se, hvordan en helt håndfri oplevelse som den, der tilbydes af BlueAnt V1 kan være fremragende for chauffører og andre mennesker, der har brug for deres hænder. Det er derfor, du bruger et Bluetooth-headset i første omgang.<br/><br/>Ulempen er, at stemmestyringen kan være "wonky", og det kan være ret frustrerende, når du ved et uheld giver det en kommando, som du ikke vil have det til at gøre. Hvad sker der, hvis du er i et opkald med nogen, og du tilfældigvis siger "slutopkald"? |
| Wednesday, July 06, 2005<br/><br/>Going to college? DREAM on<br/><br/>Here is another great article about our failing (and increasingly ridiculous) immigration system, this time from the Boston Globe. A 18-year undocumented immigrant from Massachusetts was awarded a four-year scholarship at any state university because of her high test scores, but this was later rescinded once state officials found out about her immigration status. As the author of the article so rightly says,<br/><br/>"So much for celebrating the building blocks for success and the American dream. Romney says, tough luck if you are smart, hardworking, and the child of illegal immigrants."<br/><br/>It's beyond me why anyone wants to keep smart, high-achieving kids like this one out of college. Does anybody really think that denying in-state tuition and scholarships to undocumented immigrants will make any potential immigrants think twice about coming here to work? Or are policies like these motivated by fear? Despite the increasingly widespread movement in favor of the DREAM Act and state laws (see this previous post) to allow undocumented students to pay in-state tuition, it seems like the power of fear is growing.<br/><br/>It's interesting that Mass. Gov. Romney is bashing undocumented immigrants now - this article in the Economist shows how his campaign to end gay marriage in Massachusetts is closely linked to his anticipated run for the presidency in 2008. Here in New York, presumed Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton has gone to the right on immigration, claiming that she is "adamantly against illegal immigrants." It's unfortunate that the way to get ahead in politics (particularly in the red states) is to blame immigrants for our problems. It will be interesting to see if an increased Latino turnout in places like the Southwest will prove Hillary wrong.<br/><br/>3 comments:<br/><br/>Maybe people do not want illegal aliens to get scholarhips for the following reasons:<br/><br/>1. Their parents violated the law to enter the country. 2. Their parents had to steal someone's identity to work in this country. 3. Their parents have to cheat on their income taxes (and other taxes) to stay here. 4. Their parents had to lie to get their children admitted. 5. their parents lied on applications for things like free lunch.<br/><br/>First, the Supreme Court ruled in 1982 that all children have the right to public education regardless of immigration status. Schools are prohibited from asking about a child's immigration status, meaning that undocumented parents do not have to "lie" to get their kids free lunch.<br/><br/>Second, many immigrants do not have to use another identity or cheat on income taxes in order to work here -- many employers knowingly hire undocumented immigrants (this has been happening for some time - the 1986 Imm. Reform and Control Act's attempted to deal with it, and many anti-immigrant advocates argue that employer sanctions need to be strengthened today) and quite a few immigrants pay income taxes and other taxes that they never end up receiving the benefits of (the New York Times reported that illegal immigrants provide social security with a subsidy of $7 billion a year).<br/><br/>Finally, if the biggest problem with undocumented immigrants is that they are breaking the law by being here, should that same standard be applied to businesses that knowingly hire them (which, by the way, is also against the law even though it is rarely enforced)? Should the kids of these businesspeople be denied the same opportunities because their parents broke the law? Could we extend this argument to the children of everyone who has ever broken the law in this country?<br/><br/>Whatever you think about illegal immigration, the point is that the kids should not be punished for their parents' decisions to come here. Especially when these bright and hardworking undocumented students have the potential to contribute so much to our society. | onsdag, juli 06, 2005<br/><br/>Skal du på college?<br/><br/>Her er endnu en god artikel om vores svigtende (og stadig mere latterlige) immigrationssystem, denne gang fra Boston Globe. En 18-årig udokumenteret indvandrer fra Massachusetts blev tildelt et fireårigt stipendium på ethvert statsuniversitet på grund af hendes høje testresultater, men dette blev senere ophævet, når statsembedsmænd fandt ud af hendes indvandringsstatus. Som forfatteren af artiklen så rigtigt siger,<br/><br/>"Så meget for at fejre byggestenene til succes og den amerikanske drøm. Romney siger, hårdt held, hvis du er smart, hårdtarbejdende og barn af ulovlige indvandrere."<br/><br/>Jeg fatter ikke, hvorfor nogen vil holde kloge, højtopnående børn som denne væk fra college. Tror nogen virkelig, at nægtelse af in-state undervisning og stipendier til udokumenterede indvandrere vil få potentielle indvandrere til at tænke to gange om at komme her for at arbejde? Eller er politikker som disse motiveret af frygt? På trods af den stadig mere udbredte bevægelse til fordel for DREAM Act og statslige love (se dette tidligere indlæg) for at give udokumenterede studerende mulighed for at betale in-state undervisning, ser det ud til, at frygtens magt vokser.<br/><br/>Det er interessant, at Mass. Gov Romney er bashing udokumenterede indvandrere nu - denne artikel i Economist viser, hvordan hans kampagne for at afslutte homoseksuelle ægteskab i Massachusetts er tæt knyttet til hans forventede køre til formandskabet i 2008. Her i New York er den formodede demokratiske frontløber Hillary Clinton gået til højre om indvandring og hævder, at hun er "adamtant imod ulovlige indvandrere." Det er uheldigt, at den måde at komme videre i politik (især i de røde stater) er at bebrejde indvandrere for vores problemer. Det vil være interessant at se, om en øget latino valgdeltagelse på steder som sydvest vil bevise Hillary forkert.<br/><br/>3 kommentarer:<br/><br/>Måske vil folk ikke have ulovlige udlændinge til at få lærdomme af følgende grunde:<br/><br/>1. Deres forældre overtrådte loven for at komme ind i landet. 2. Deres forældre var nødt til at stjæle en persons identitet for at arbejde i dette land. 3. Deres forældre er nødt til at snyde på deres indkomstskat (og andre skatter) for at blive her. 4. Deres forældre måtte lyve for at få deres børn indlagt. 5. deres forældre løj på ansøgninger om ting som gratis frokost.<br/><br/>Højesteret fastslog i 1982, at alle børn har ret til offentlig uddannelse uanset immigrationsstatus. Skoler er forbudt at spørge om et barns indvandringsstatus, hvilket betyder, at udokumenterede forældre ikke behøver at "løgne" for at få deres børn gratis frokost.<br/><br/>For det andet behøver mange indvandrere ikke at bruge en anden identitet eller snyde på indkomstskatter for at arbejde her - mange arbejdsgivere ansætter bevidst udokumenterede indvandrere (dette har været sket i nogen tid - 1986 Imm. Reform and Control Acts forsøg på at håndtere det, og mange anti-immigrantfortalere hævder, at arbejdsgiversanktioner skal styrkes i dag), og en hel del indvandrere betaler indkomstskat og andre skatter, som de aldrig ender med at modtage fordelene ved (New York Times rapporterede, at ulovlige indvandrere giver social sikring med et tilskud på 7 milliarder dollars om året).<br/><br/>Endelig, hvis det største problem med papirløse indvandrere er, at de bryder loven ved at være her, skal den samme standard anvendes på virksomheder, der bevidst ansætter dem (som i øvrigt også er imod loven, selvom det sjældent håndhæves)? Skal børn af disse forretningsfolk nægtes de samme muligheder, fordi deres forældre brød loven? Kan vi udvide dette argument til børn af alle, der nogensinde har brudt loven i dette land?<br/><br/>Uanset hvad du mener om ulovlig indvandring, er pointen, at børnene ikke skal straffes for deres forældres beslutninger om at komme her. Især når disse lyse og hårdtarbejdende udokumenterede studerende har potentiale til at bidrage så meget til vores samfund. |

| ΑΛΗΘΩΣ<br/><br/>Corporations are not people and money is not speech<br/><br/>In Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned century-old restrictions on corporate spending in elections under the guise of protecting First Amendment free speech rights. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, writing for the majority, said, "If the First Amendment has any force, it prohibits Congress from fining or jailing citizens, or associations of citizens, for simply engaging in political speech." This argument of the majority decision rests on the notions that corporations are covered by the same free speech protections as individual citizens and that campaign donations or financing are the same as speech.<br/><br/>Corporations, however, are inherently not the same as individuals and thus cannot have the same protections as individuals. There are a slew of laws that protect corporations and their interests in the arena for which they are by definition formed—namely the marketplace. The laws that govern corporations and the rights enjoyed by them are distinct from the laws and rights of individuals. A corporation, for example, can enter into contracts like an individual, but unlike an individual, a corporation's members can be protected by limited liability so their personal assets are not at stake.<br/><br/>If a corporation, then, is a distinct legal entity governed by different laws than an individual is, corporations are not protected under the First Amendment in the same way that individuals are protected. Corporations, especially in their most powerful and wealthy incarnations, are exponentially more influential than most individuals in America. The restrictions on corporate spending in elections that were overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court were meant to redress this power balance between average individuals and unduly influential businesses. Corporations already have a plethora of ways to influence politics, from political action committees to lobbyists on Capitol Hill. The framers of the Bill of Rights wanted to protect the voices of the trampled, not amplify the voices of the elite.<br/><br/>The other part of the Supreme Court's premise for its decision is that the First Amendment free speech clause applies to campaign funding. While speech can be interpreted loosely as any form of expression, such an open, ambiguous definition would create a myriad of problems with all kinds of laws. An architect has a vision of a building: it is his art, his self expression, yet he cannot ignore local zoning laws that, for instance, restrict the height of his building. Should he sue the state for violation of his free speech, his right to expression? Equating money with speech also opens the door to sundry ludicrous claims by, for instance, an employer who objects to minimum wage laws since he'd like to express that his employees are only worth paying $3 an hour. There have to be restrictions on what constitutes speech to prevent a bastardization of the term and an overly liberal interpretation of the First Amendment.<br/><br/>A corporation already has the power to issue a statement in favor of a candidate or policy through its political action committees, and individual members of a business are welcome to contribute money as well. However, allowing a corporation to use its vast profits to directly finance the election or to remove a candidate compromises the democratic notion of a free and fair election. There are unseemly ties even now between politicians and various industries, but this new ruling would make such connections more robust and give them a veneer of legitimacy. A politician financed by a business would become completely beholden to its political agenda and not to the voters.<br/><br/>It's not only the independence of politicians that's at stake, but also the independence of our judges, who are at the very least expected to be impartial. Many states still use elections to appoint judges, which leaves them vulnerable to the influence of political spending. In a recent speech at a law school conference, former Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor worried about the impact of corporate campaign funding in judicial elections, saying that "judicial campaigning makes last week's decision in Citizens United an increasing problem for maintaining an independent judiciary."<br/><br/>Two cornerstones of our democracy—free elections and an independent judiciary—are threatened by the Supreme Court's activist and meddling decision. The case could have been decided much more narrowly in favor of Citizens United, but instead, the majority of the justices decided to expand the case to champion the rights of big money over the interest of the American people. Senators Dick Durbin (D-IL) and Arlen Specter (D-PA) introduced the Fair Elections Now Act last March. It would prohibit contributions from political action committees and would match individual donations, limited to $100, on a 4:1 basis so that fundraising focuses on the people. Such a system has been in place in New York City since the 1988 Campaign Finance Act. The rest of the country is long overdue to follow. Never before has the fight for public financing been more necessary.<br/><br/>The author is a Columbia College junior majoring in political science. She is a prospective law student.<br/><br/>The 14th amendment, which was one of the Reconstruction amendments added following the War of Northern Aggression was never legally ratified by the States and has caused more problems than all the other post-war amendments combined. If my memory serves me right, corporations were declared by the Supreme Court to be 14th Amemdment citizens during the late 1800s or early 1900s. In case you are unfamiliar with the wording of this amendment, it basically made everyone a citizen (and subject) of the United States. Prior to the War, all individuals were citizens of the State within which they resided and no one was a citizen of the United States nor were they subject to the jurisdiction of the United States except for those who resided in the District of Columbia or resided within one of the territories under the jurisdiction of the United States. The main purposes of the War of Northern Aggression was to destroy the soverienty of the individual States and reduce the status of every American to that of a subject under the control and jurisdiction of the United States government. The founding fathers set up our government as a loose confederation of Sovereign States with the States exercising all meaningful polical power. They never invisioned or intended any effective political power to reside in Washington. Things will only get much worse until We the People throw the theives and money changers out of Washington and restore our government back to what it once was.<br/><br/>The word person means corporation in law. It is not that corporations are not people, it is that people are not corporations. We have been tricked into accepting a corporate identity[ALL CAPS]. Look at your drivers license. Every time we go to court,we go as a corporation, not as a natural person.The first corporations were governments. Looked at logically, limited liability for a corporation is the extension of sovereign immunity to the king after he was no longer king. The same ruling elite families are still in control and that goes all the way back to the first known about extraterrestrials[anunaki] that the Sumerian documents talk about.The same group also take the credit or blame for all the religions and secret societies.<br/><br/>What difference does it make? Really. Think about it, the whole entire Congress and Senate are a dog and pony show, the real power brokers who control it all are in the shadows, working the deals, doing what they want, with the AL-CIA-DA and MOSSAD out there killing everyone who disagrees with these shadow government assholes who truly run it all.<br/><br/>So, why is it so important now to be so upset over this shit? Why now? After more than two hundred years of absolute proof that the politicians are just a fancy hand puppet show to distract us from the REAL WHEELING AND DEALING IN THE BACK ROOMS elsewhere, why does it matter now that the total contempt of democracy is being demonstrated by SCOTUS in this ruling? The assholes on this court know that the real guys with their hands on the power levers of the system aren't in the Congress and the Senate.<br/><br/>When the Rule of Law became OBSOLETE in the world, in general, and everything became more or less ROLLERBALL only this time, on STEROIDS, for and by the CORPORATIONS, why did this sole ruling make all that much difference? Why do all of you assholes think that this 'lagging' indicator of the end of any semblances of democratic government makes any difference.<br/><br/>Hypothetically, let's say this ruling had not happened. Do any of you think that the corporations and the moneyed influences in the shadows wouldn't have continued to exert any and all of their will on the rest of us?<br/><br/>For those of you who think it'd been different, I suggest you find a remedy to your TOTAL NAIVETE!!!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>this ruling didn't make one iota of a difference. It was always like this, long before SCOTUS basically said to corporations; "go ahead, do what the fuck you want…the little people are just cannon fodder for your wars, chattel for you to barter and sell at your leisure.."<br/><br/>democracy was always an illusion. We never ever had any control, ever. making such a mountain out of this mole hill is absolutely unwarranted, in light of the fact that for the whole entire 230 year history of this republic, the fat cats and the rich oligarchs never needed any Congress or Senate to do what they pleased, under any circumstances, ever. They just did it.<br/><br/>The government you were looking at was a chimera, not real..<br/><br/>the sooner you all come to that realization, the sooner we can get on with less pissing and moaning over a mere joke of a technicality that was always the case from day one, and was not foisted on us by the SCOTUS, the court only quite belatedly declared to us what has been happening for a long long long, corrupt time.<br/><br/>I've got a mad crush on Exxon, and Exxon has one on me, wedding bells in the spring – a bit quick I know, but our love can't be denied. Exxon is a little shy, so don't expect any public announcements, we're thinking a quiet wedding in Reno.<br/><br/>Any business is simply a group of individuals (small or large) exercising their individual rights collectively. Therefore, any business has the same rights as those individuals (except, of course, the right to vote, which is reserved to the individuals themselves). The freedom to dispose of one's wealth as one sees fit comes along with the freedom to earn it. If an aggregate of individuals has earned money, it should be free to decide how do dispose of that money. The real problem is not that businesses can donate to campaigns, it is that the government has been allowed to meddle in business – i.e. that the government can grant some favor in return for that money. We need separation of commerce and state in the same way and for the same reasons as we have separation of church and state. I also find it interesting that the author chose as examples two laws (zoning and minimum wage) that also violate individual rights. The first violates property rights and the second violates the rights of individuals to contract freely.<br/><br/>under your jackoffian analysis, nobody should interfere with anything anyone does at all. say, if I were in a crowd, with a saturday night special, and I want to 'free speech' your butt with it much in the same way the CIA free speeched Bobby Kennedy in L.A. one night, that's fine, because to interfere with me is interfering with my right to free speech you.<br/><br/>that's the critical flaw with you libertarian assholes….you think that there is no societal role for any rule of law, that anything that fits under 'ends justify means' rationale shouldn't ever be interfered with, just let everyone do whatever they so choose, and it all works out. That Ayn Rand bullshit doesn't work, dude! It works right up to the point where someone else pays a price for your 'whatever i wanna do' freedom crosses a line and then interfere with my freedom.<br/><br/>rules and laws SHOULD exist in the framework of society strictly to keep in check that good old "I can do anything I want to and it's just me being free" line of horse shit.<br/><br/>Corporations do not have any rights, dorkus! globally, they have been the reason why there are so many failed states, pillaged by the will of corporatocrats based in the U.S.S.A. who think that freedom of their speech translates into; "do what we tell you or we'll bomb you to get your resources we need" kind of raping and pillaging.<br/><br/>someday, I hope some asshole fucks you with their 'free speech' and then we'll hear your sorry ass whine about how the law let you down. What law? In your libertarian world of 'I can do what I want', the only rule of law is the one you make up to justify your end goal. For you then, it'll be fun to see how you cope with some other asshole's interpretation of your boundary being just a little bit of a mere inconvenience for his goals, which didn't necessarily respect your boundaries at all, for damned sure!<br/><br/>Someone by the name of "uh huh, right.." might have a logical point hidden in the forest of name-calling and straw-man abuse, but how about this: Corporations are inventions of the State that are created to pass some of the risks of doing business from the people running the business over to the stockholders (if any), the customers (if any) and the public. So if a corporation commits a fraud, it is the corporation that's punished (usually) and fined and the people who run the corporation get to walk away with a golden handshake. And the cost of the fine is passed along to the customers and paid to the government (not the victims!). To "David"s point, if we were to separate government and commerce, corporations would cease to exist! Not a bad idea.<br/><br/>I think that the point is, that if a corporation commits a financial crime, and nobody notices (the if the tree falls in the forest and nobody hears it, did it truly make a noise argument) then did a crime actually take place?<br/><br/>and in a veitch diagram, where the two blobs collide and interact, if one encroaches on the other one's boundary, who is the arbiter of who got violated?<br/><br/>my point is this: there are no straw man arguments with regard to david's asinine assessment that corporations can do whatever they want with abandon. the truth of the matter is, granting corporations, and oligarchs, or whomever, a license to do what they want, whenever they want, under the premise that THEY ARE INDIVIDUALS and hence, guaranteed FREE SPEECH, is both absurd and horse shit.<br/><br/>corporations are made up of groups of people. people who should live by some semblance of Rule of Law. When they don't have to, then it's "I can do anything I want as long as nobody catches me or holds me accountable for my transgressions" going on here.<br/><br/>if that's the world David wants to live in, let him go there and make it happen, but goddamn it, don't expect me not to fucking object to that shit!<br/><br/>We can all get along, just as long as boundaries are not gratuitously violated at will by anyone who thinks their right to do what they want actually nullifies my right not to be interfered with by their actions.<br/><br/>with regard to corporations, they have no right to violate my rights, or yours, or anyone elses. If they can't function in the community as a benevolent and hence, non interfering entity, then they have no right to exist.<br/><br/>and David wasn't being threatened. he's an asshole for asserting that "do what you want, it's freedom of speech" is a bunch of horse shit. It's la la land bullshit. And I object to anyone or anything violating my boundaries with that free speech assertion. That's a crock of shit and you know it is!<br/><br/>Well, that was a colorful response. Sadly, "uh-uh", you are way off the mark. I never said people have the right to infringe on anyone else's rights…and I repudiate "ends justify the means" thinking. Yes, laws SHOULD exist, but ONLY to PROTECT the rights of people. I'm sorry you have such a warped and horribly incorrect view of my argument.<br/><br/>your point well taken, David. I apologize for peeing in your corn flakes. I think I thought you were inferring that corporations were able to do whatever they pleased under this right of FREEDOM OF SPEECH, which in Amerk'a is a joke today because the PATRIOT ACT and a non-declared state of MARTIAL LAW we've been living under since Sept. 2001, has given the government the ability to suspend and or 'shred' the U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights.<br/><br/>sadly, people have only a few rights. we have the right to be taxed to the point of absurdity. we have the right to be conscripted and become cannon fodder for oligarch wars. and we have the right to shut the fuck up and be quiet while we are being joy boinked by corporations and oligarchs and bankers. those are our rights, and sadly, they truly SUCKETH, David. I think we can agree on that!<br/><br/>I'm still wondering how the newbie, Roberts, inherited the Chief Justiceship after Rhenquist rather than that role going to someone with more experience on the bench. What does "The Roberts Court" plan to do next, though, for corporations? Give them the right to vote at the polls like real people?; perhaps have votes by human beings counted as 3/5 of a person or less to their 1?<br/><br/>I haven't read all of the 183-page booklength "ruling" yet but find these appalling statements therein to be not only contradictory to their expansive actions in this case but also something of an abdication of their duty:<br/><br/>"the gravest and most delicate duty that this Court is called upon to perform." Blodgett v. Holden, 275 U. S. 142, 147–148 (1927) (Holmes, J., concurring). Because the stakes are so high, our standard practice is to refrain from addressing constitutional questions except when necessary to rule on particular claims before us. See Ashwander v. TVA, 297 U. S. 288, 346–348 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concur-ring). This policy underlies both our willingness to construe ambiguous statutes to avoid constitutional problems and our practice "'never to formulate a rule of constitutional law broader than is required by the precise facts to which it is to be applied.'" United States v. Raines, 362<br/>U. S. 17, 21 (1960) (quoting Liverpool, New York & Philadelphia S. S. Co. v. Commissioners of Emigration, 113<br/>U. S. 33, 39 (1885)).<br/>The majority and dissent are united in expressing allegiance to these principles. Ante, at 12; post, at 14 (STEVENS, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). >><br/><br/>Roberts, by virtue of his lies during CONfirmation by the DEMS who shoved his lying ass thru the process at mach speed, needs to be 'impeached' for being a fucking liar. He specifically stated he would not go this route of writing decisions not based on settled, non controversial concepts of the U.S. Constitution…and here clearly he has done exactly the opposite of that.<br/><br/>The real blame should be on the shoulders of the cocksuckers in the SENATE that confirmed the son of a bitch in the first place, stating they wouldn't vote against his confirmation because they were saving their ammo for REAL THREATS TO US..<br/><br/>I blame the fucking DINOCRATS more than I blame this lying pile of shit named Roberts. Pricks like SCHUMER and that other asshole from Illinois, and that lying zionist bastard Levin from Michigan. Just a couple of them holding their ground could have stopped the confirmation of Alito, and then Roberts. But they let it slide.<br/><br/>the assertion that all of this is indeed window dressing is a correct one, and the truth is, though blatantly a violation of our rights across the board, these scum in the SCOTUS are only post fact, asserting the screwing they were doing to us for a long, long, long time.<br/><br/>the truth is, it never mattered what we thought was going on, because Corporations have been functioning well outside the law for a long time now, and nobody has held them accountable. the very bastards that sit on the SCOTUS are benefactors of the wrongdoing and greed of the corporations who provide kickbacks to them for their decisions, in the form of STOCK DIVIDENDS.<br/><br/>unfortunately, focusing on the corrupt SCOTUS doesn't help us much. It's like stating the obvious, and expecting it to be punishable, when it is not.<br/><br/>we are fucked no matter how we look at it, but there will be a day of atonement. Once they take away every last vestige of personal dignity of the entire middle class in this country, there will be hell to pay.

Cf. 2 U. S. C. §441e (contribution and expenditure ban applied to "foreign national[s]"). Section 441b is not limited to corporations or associations that were created in foreign countries or funded predominantly by foreign shareholders. Section 441b therefore would be overbroad even if we assumed, arguendo, that the Government has a compelling interest in limiting foreign influence over our political process. See Broadrick, 413<br/>U. S., at 615. >><br/><br/>The US went bankrupt when FDR called in the gold. We had no more gold to pay for the paper we borrowed from the FED. It is now in a yearly bankruptcy rollover. The government is now private like BLACKWATER. All government agencies are listed on DUNN AND BRADSTREET. The common law which the constitution specifies pertains to natural people. All business by the courts today is corporate meaning that we are viewed as individual corporations. We exist by contract with the state. Remember the 14th amendment. There were no US citizens before that. Most of us have unwittingly claimed US corporate citizenship. We need to address the rule by the banking elite.Almost all leading REPS and DEMS are members of the COUNCIL OF FOREIGN RELATIONS or the TLC. LOok up the history of who started and controls these. Rush, Glenn and Sean are all liars and banker bootlickers. Obama is a puppet for the CFR. 911 truth has a great deal more bearing and would serve to unite the honest people in this country.<br/><br/>I don't really believe I'm a corporation or the citizen of one but, if the gubbermint thinks so, does the SCOTUS ruling mean that there are no more campaign contribution limits on anyone, businesses or individuals? I'd rather see money removed from our electoral process altogether — equal time on America's airwaves given at no charge for all candidates | Øjne<br/><br/>Virksomheder er ikke mennesker, og penge er ikke tale.<br/><br/>I Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission omstødte den amerikanske højesteret århundrede gamle restriktioner på virksomhedernes udgifter til valg under dække af at beskytte ytringsfriheden. Dommer Anthony M. Kennedy, der skrev for flertallet, sagde: "Hvis det første ændringsforslag har nogen kraft, forbyder det Kongressen at bøde eller fængsle borgere eller sammenslutninger af borgere for blot at engagere sig i politisk tale." Dette argument i flertalsbeslutningen hviler på forestillingen om, at virksomheder er omfattet af den samme ytringsfrihed som den enkelte borger, og at kampagnedonationer eller finansiering er det samme som tale.<br/><br/>Virksomheder er imidlertid i sagens natur ikke det samme som individer og kan derfor ikke have samme beskyttelse som individer. Der er en masse love, der beskytter virksomheder og deres interesser i arenaen, som de er per definition dannet - nemlig markedet. De love, der regulerer selskaber og de rettigheder, som de nyder, adskiller sig fra enkeltpersoners love og rettigheder. Et selskab kan for eksempel indgå kontrakter som en person, men i modsætning til en person kan et selskabs medlemmer beskyttes af begrænset ansvar, så deres personlige aktiver ikke er på spil.<br/><br/>Hvis et selskab er en særskilt juridisk enhed, der er underlagt andre love end en person, er selskaber ikke beskyttet under den første ændring på samme måde, som enkeltpersoner er beskyttet. Virksomheder, især i deres mest magtfulde og velhavende inkarnationer, er eksponentielt mere indflydelsesrige end de fleste individer i Amerika. Begrænsningerne på virksomhedernes udgifter i valg, der blev væltet af den amerikanske højesteret, var beregnet til at genoprette denne magtbalance mellem gennemsnitlige enkeltpersoner og unødigt indflydelsesrige virksomheder. Virksomheder har allerede en overflod af måder at påvirke politik på, fra politiske aktionskomiteer til lobbyister på Capitol Hill. Ophavsmændene til Bill of Rights ønskede at beskytte de trampede stemmer, ikke forstærke elitens stemmer.<br/><br/>Den anden del af Højesterets forudsætning for sin afgørelse er, at den første ændring af ytringsfrihedsklausulen gælder for kampagnefinansiering. Mens tale kan fortolkes løst som enhver form for udtryk, ville en sådan åben, tvetydig definition skabe et utal af problemer med alle former for love. En arkitekt har en vision om en bygning: det er hans kunst, hans selvudtryk, men han kan ikke ignorere lokale zonelovgivninger, der for eksempel begrænser højden af hans bygning. Skal han sagsøge staten for krænkelse af hans ytringsfrihed, hans ret til udtryk? At sidestille penge med tale åbner også døren til forskellige latterlige krav fra for eksempel en arbejdsgiver, der protesterer mod mindstelønslove, da han gerne vil udtrykke, at hans medarbejdere kun er værd at betale $ 3 i timen. Der skal være begrænsninger på, hvad der udgør tale for at forhindre en bastardisering af udtrykket og en alt for liberal fortolkning af det første ændringsforslag.<br/><br/>Et selskab har allerede beføjelse til at udstede en erklæring til fordel for en kandidat eller politik gennem sine politiske aktionsudvalg, og individuelle medlemmer af en virksomhed er også velkomne til at bidrage med penge. Men at tillade et selskab at bruge sine enorme overskud til direkte at finansiere valget eller at fjerne en kandidat kompromitterer den demokratiske forestilling om et frit og retfærdigt valg. Der er uhensigtsmæssige bånd selv nu mellem politikere og forskellige industrier, men denne nye afgørelse ville gøre sådanne forbindelser mere robuste og give dem en finér af legitimitet. En politiker, der er finansieret af en virksomhed, ville blive fuldstændig afhængig af sin politiske dagsorden og ikke af vælgerne.<br/><br/>Det er ikke kun politikernes uafhængighed, der er på spil, men også vores dommeres uafhængighed, som i det mindste forventes at være upartiske. Mange stater bruger stadig valg til at udpege dommere, hvilket gør dem sårbare over for indflydelse fra politiske udgifter. I en nylig tale på en lovskole konference, tidligere højesteretsdommer Sandra Day O'Connor bekymret for virkningen af corporate kampagne finansiering i retslige valg, siger, at "retslige kampagne gør sidste uges beslutning i Citizens United et stigende problem for at opretholde en uafhængig retsvæsen."<br/><br/>To hjørnestene i vores demokrati - frie valg og et uafhængigt retsvæsen - er truet af højesterets aktivistiske og indblandingsbeslutning. Sagen kunne have været afgjort meget mere snævert til fordel for Citizens United, men i stedet besluttede flertallet af dommerne at udvide sagen til at kæmpe for de store penges rettigheder frem for det amerikanske folks interesse. Senatorer Dick Durbin (D-IL) og Arlen Specter (D-PA) introducerede Fair Elections Now Act i marts sidste år. Det ville forbyde bidrag fra politiske aktionskomiteer og ville matche individuelle donationer, begrænset til $ 100, på en 4:1 basis, så fundraising fokuserer på folket. Et sådant system har været på plads i New York City siden 1988 Campaign Finance Act. Resten af landet er længe ventet at følge. Aldrig før har kampen for offentlig finansiering været mere nødvendig.<br/><br/>Forfatteren er en Columbia College junior med hovedfag i statskundskab. Hun er en potentiel jurastuderende.<br/><br/>Den 14. ændring, som var en af de genopbygning ændringsforslag tilføjet efter krigen mod nord aggression blev aldrig lovligt ratificeret af staterne og har forårsaget flere problemer end alle de andre efterkrigstidens ændringer tilsammen. Hvis min hukommelse tjener mig rigtigt, blev virksomheder erklæret af Højesteret for at være 14. Amemdment borgere i slutningen af 1800-tallet eller begyndelsen af 1900-tallet. Hvis du ikke er bekendt med ordlyden af dette ændringsforslag, det dybest set gjort alle en borger (og emne) i USA. Før krigen var alle personer statsborgere i den stat, hvor de boede, og ingen var statsborger i USA, og de var heller ikke underlagt USA's jurisdiktion undtagen for dem, der boede i District of Columbia eller boede inden for et af de territorier, der hører under USA's jurisdiktion. Hovedformålet med den nordlige aggressionskrig var at ødelægge de enkelte staters suverænitet og reducere hver amerikaners status til et emne under kontrol og jurisdiktion af den amerikanske regering. Grundlæggerne oprettede vores regering som en løs sammenslutning af suveræne stater med stater, der udøver al meningsfuld politisk magt. Tingene vil kun blive meget værre, indtil We the People smider teives og pengevekslere ud af Washington og genopretter vores regering tilbage til, hvad den engang var.<br/><br/>Ordet person betyder corporation in law. Det er ikke, at virksomheder ikke er mennesker, det er, at mennesker ikke er virksomheder. Vi er blevet narret til at acceptere en virksomhedsidentitet [ALL CAPS]. Se på dit kørekort. Hver gang vi går til retten, går vi som et selskab, ikke som en fysisk person. De første selskaber var regeringer. Set på logisk, begrænset ansvar for et selskab er udvidelsen af suveræn immunitet over for kongen, efter at han ikke længere var konge. De samme herskende elitefamilier er stadig i kontrol, og det går helt tilbage til de første kendte om udenjordiske [anunaki], som de sumeriske dokumenter taler om. Den samme gruppe tager også æren eller skylden for alle religioner og hemmelige selskaber.<br/><br/>- Hvilken forskel gør det? Tænk på det, hele Kongressen og Senatet er et hunde- og ponyshow, de virkelige magtmæglere, der styrer det hele, er i skyggerne, arbejder med aftalerne, gør hvad de vil, med AL-CIA-DA og MOSSAD derude, der dræber alle, der er uenige med disse skyggeregeringsrøvhuller, der virkelig kører det hele.<br/><br/>Hvorfor er det så vigtigt nu at være så ked af det? Efter mere end to hundrede års absolut bevis på, at politikerne blot er et fancy hånddukkeshow, der distraherer os fra det virkelige hvirvlende og fra at handle i baglokalerne andre steder, hvorfor betyder det så noget nu, at den totale foragt for demokratiet bliver demonstreret af SCOTUS i denne afgørelse? Røvhullerne ved, at de rigtige fyre ikke sidder i Kongressen og Senatet.<br/><br/>Da retsstaten blev obsolet i verden generelt, og alt blev mere eller mindre ROLLERBALL kun denne gang, på STEROIDS, for og af virksomhederne, hvorfor gjorde denne eneste afgørelse så stor forskel? Hvorfor tror alle I røvhuller, at denne "forsinkede" indikator for enden på enhver form for demokratisk regering gør nogen forskel.<br/><br/>Tror nogen af jer, at selskaberne og de pengeskabte påvirkninger i skyggerne ikke ville have fortsat med at udøve al deres vilje på resten af os?<br/><br/>For dem af jer, der tror, at det havde været anderledes, foreslår jeg, at du finder et middel til din TOTAL NAIVETE!!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>Denne afgørelse gjorde ikke en tøddel af en forskel. Det var altid sådan her, længe før SCOTUS dybest set sagde til virksomheder: "Fortsæt, gør hvad fanden du vil ... de små mennesker er bare kanonføde til dine krige, chattel for dig at bytte og sælge på din fritid .."<br/><br/>Demokratiet har altid været en illusion, og vi har aldrig haft kontrol. At gøre et sådant bjerg ud af denne muldvarp bakke er absolut uberettiget, i lyset af det faktum, at for hele hele 230 år historie denne republik, de fede katte og de rige oligarker aldrig havde brug for nogen kongres eller senat til at gøre, hvad de ønskede, under nogen omstændigheder, nogensinde. De gjorde det bare.<br/><br/>Den regering, du kiggede på, var en kimær, ikke ægte.<br/><br/>Jo før I alle kommer til denne erkendelse, jo hurtigere kan vi komme videre med mindre pissing og stønnen over en simpel joke af en teknikalitet, der altid var tilfældet fra dag ét, og ikke blev påtvunget os af SCOTUS, retten kun ganske sent erklærede for os, hvad der har været sker i en lang lang lang lang lang korrupt tid.<br/><br/>Jeg har en gal crush på Exxon, og Exxon har en på mig, bryllupsklokker i foråret - lidt hurtig jeg ved, men vores kærlighed kan ikke benægtes. Exxon er lidt genert, så forvent ikke nogen offentlige meddelelser, vi tænker på et stille bryllup i Reno.<br/><br/>Enhver virksomhed er simpelthen en gruppe af individer (små eller store) udøver deres individuelle rettigheder kollektivt. Derfor har enhver virksomhed de samme rettigheder som disse individer (undtagen selvfølgelig retten til at stemme, som er forbeholdt individerne selv). Friheden til at disponere over ens rigdom, som man finder passende, kommer sammen med friheden til at tjene det. Hvis et aggregat af enkeltpersoner har tjent penge, bør det være gratis at beslutte, hvordan man skal bortskaffe disse penge. Det virkelige problem er ikke, at virksomheder kan donere til kampagner, det er, at regeringen har fået lov til at blande sig i erhvervslivet - dvs. at regeringen kan give en vis fordel til gengæld for de penge. Vi har brug for adskillelse af handel og stat på samme måde og af samme grunde, som vi har adskillelse af kirke og stat. Jeg finder det også interessant, at forfatteren valgte som eksempler to love (zoneinddeling og mindsteløn), der også krænker individuelle rettigheder. Den første krænker ejendomsretten, og den anden krænker den enkeltes ret til frit at indgå kontrakter.<br/><br/>Under din jackoffian analyse, bør ingen blande sig i noget, som nogen gør overhovedet. Hvis jeg var i en flok, med en lørdag aften special, og jeg ønsker at "ytringsfrihed" din røv med det meget på samme måde som CIA fri tale Bobby Kennedy i L.A. en nat, det er fint, fordi at blande sig med mig er at blande sig i min ret til ytringsfrihed dig.<br/><br/>I tror, at der ikke er nogen samfundsmæssig rolle for nogen retsstat, at alt, hvad der passer ind under "mål retfærdiggør midler" rationale, aldrig bør blandes ind i, bare lad alle gøre, hvad de vælger, og det hele fungerer. Det Ayn Rand-lort går så vidt, at en anden betaler en pris for din frihed og så blander sig i min frihed.<br/><br/>regler og love bør eksistere inden for rammerne af samfundet strengt for at holde i skak, at gode gamle "Jeg kan gøre noget, jeg vil, og det er bare mig at være fri" linje af hest lort.<br/><br/>Virksomheder har ingen rettigheder, dorkus! Globalt har de været årsagen til, at der er så mange mislykkede stater, plyndret af korporatokrater baseret i USA, der tror, at deres ytringsfrihed kan oversættes til; "gør, hvad vi fortæller dig, eller vi vil bombe dig for at få dine ressourcer, vi har brug for" slags voldtægt og plyndring.<br/><br/>En dag håber jeg, at et røvhul knepper dig med deres ytringsfrihed, og så hører vi din sørgelige klynken om, hvordan loven svigtede dig. I din libertarianske verden af 'Jeg kan gøre, hvad jeg vil', er den eneste lov, du gør op for at retfærdiggøre dit slutmål. For dig så vil det være sjovt at se, hvordan du klare en anden røvhul fortolkning af din grænse er bare en lille smule af en ren ulejlighed for hans mål, som ikke nødvendigvis respektere dine grænser overhovedet, for pokker sikker!<br/><br/>Nogen ved navn "uh huh, right .." kan have et logisk punkt skjult i skoven af navneopråb og halm-mand misbrug, men hvad med dette: Virksomheder er opfindelser af staten, der er skabt til at videregive nogle af de risici ved at gøre forretninger fra de mennesker, der kører virksomheden over til aktionærerne (hvis nogen), kunderne (hvis nogen) og offentligheden. Så hvis et selskab begår en svig, er det selskabet, der straffes (normalt) og bøder, og de mennesker, der styrer selskabet, kommer til at gå væk med et gyldent håndtryk. Og omkostningerne ved bøden er gået videre til kunderne og betalt til regeringen (ikke ofrene!). Til "David" punkt, hvis vi skulle adskille regering og handel, selskaber ville ophøre med at eksistere! Ikke en dårlig idé.<br/><br/>Jeg tror, at pointen er, at hvis et selskab begår en økonomisk forbrydelse, og ingen bemærker (hvis træet falder i skoven, og ingen hører det, gjorde det virkelig et støjargument) så fandt en forbrydelse faktisk sted?<br/><br/>og i et kørediagram, hvor de to klatter kolliderer og interagerer, hvis den ene griber ind på den andens grænse, hvem er dommeren af hvem der blev overtrådt?<br/><br/>min pointe er denne: der er ingen halm mand argumenter med hensyn til Davids asinine vurdering, at virksomheder kan gøre, hvad de vil med opgive. Sandheden er, at give virksomheder og oligarker, eller hvem som helst, en licens til at gøre, hvad de vil, når de vil, under forudsætning af, at de er individer og dermed garanteret fri tale, er både absurd og heste lort.<br/><br/>virksomheder består af grupper af mennesker. mennesker, der skal leve efter en vis form for retsstat. Når de ikke behøver, så er det "Jeg kan gøre alt, hvad jeg vil, så længe ingen fanger mig eller holder mig ansvarlig for mine overtrædelser", der foregår her.<br/><br/>Hvis det er den verden, David vil leve i, så lad ham gå derhen og få det til at ske, men for fanden, forvent ikke, at jeg ikke protesterer mod det lort!<br/><br/>Vi kan alle komme overens, lige så længe grænserne ikke umotiveret krænkes af enhver, der mener, at deres ret til at gøre, hvad de vil, faktisk ophæver min ret til ikke at blive forstyrret af deres handlinger.<br/><br/>Med hensyn til virksomheder, har de ingen ret til at krænke mine rettigheder, eller dine, eller nogen andres. Hvis de ikke kan fungere i samfundet som en velvillig og dermed ikke forstyrrende enhed, så har de ingen ret til at eksistere.<br/><br/>Og David blev ikke truet. Han er et røvhul for at hævde, at "Gør hvad du vil, det er ytringsfrihed" er en masse hestelort. Det er la la land bullshit. Og jeg protesterer mod nogen eller noget, der overtræder mine grænser med den ytringsfrihed påstand. Det er noget lort, og det ved du, at det er!<br/><br/>Jeg har aldrig sagt, at folk har ret til at krænke andres rettigheder. Ja, love burde eksistere, men kun for at beskytte folks rettigheder. Jeg er ked af, at du har sådan et skævt og forfærdeligt forkert syn på mit argument.<br/><br/>Jeg beklager, at du tisser i dine cornflakes. Jeg tror, at jeg troede, at du udledte, at virksomheder var i stand til at gøre, hvad de ønskede under denne ret til ytringsfrihed, som i Amerk'a er en joke i dag, fordi PATRIOT ACT og en ikke-erklæret tilstand af MARTIAL LOV, vi har levet under siden september 2001, har givet regeringen mulighed for at suspendere og eller "shred" den amerikanske forfatning og Bill of Rights.<br/><br/>Desværre har folk kun få rettigheder. Vi har ret til at blive beskattet til det absurde punkt. Vi har ret til at blive indkaldt og blive kanonføde til oligarkkrige. og vi har ret til at holde kæft og være stille, mens vi bliver glæde boinked af virksomheder og oligarker og bankfolk. det er vores rettigheder, og desværre, de virkelig SUCKETH, David. Jeg tror, vi kan blive enige om det!<br/><br/>Jeg spekulerer stadig på, hvordan den nybegynder, Roberts, arvede Chief Justiceship efter Rhenquist i stedet for at den rolle går til en person med mere erfaring på bænken. Hvad planlægger "The Roberts Court" at gøre næste for virksomheder? Give dem ret til at stemme ved meningsmålinger som rigtige mennesker?; måske har stemmer af mennesker tælles som 3/5 af en person eller mindre til deres 1?<br/><br/>Jeg har ikke læst alle de 183-siders boglængde "afgørelser" endnu, men finder disse forfærdelige udsagn deri ikke kun i modstrid med deres ekspansive handlinger i dette tilfælde, men også noget af en frafaldelse af deres pligt:<br/><br/>"den alvorligste og mest delikate pligt, som denne domstol er kaldet til at udføre." Blodgett v. Holden, 275 US 142, 147-1948 (1927) (Holmes, J., concurrent). Fordi indsatsen er så høj, er vores standardpraksis at afstå fra at tage forfatningsmæssige spørgsmål, undtagen når det er nødvendigt at afgøre bestemte krav foran os. Se Ashwander v. TVA, 297 US 288, 346-348 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concur-ring). Denne politik ligger til grund for både vores vilje til at fortolke tvetydige vedtægter for at undgå forfatningsmæssige problemer og vores praksis "aldrig at formulere en forfatningsretlig regel bredere end det er påkrævet af de præcise fakta, som den skal anvendes på." USA v. Raines, 362<br/>U.S. 17, 21 (1960) (citerer Liverpool, New York & Philadelphia S.S. Co. mod Commissioners of Emigration, 113<br/>U. S. 33, 39 (1885).<br/>De fleste og uenige er forenet i at udtrykke troskab til disse principper. Ante, på 12; post, på 14 (STEVENS, J., enige i en del og afvigende i en del). >><br/><br/>Roberts, i kraft af sine løgne under bekræftelse af DEMS, der skubbede hans løgnagtige røv gennem processen med mach hastighed, skal "anklages" for at være en fucking løgner. Han erklærede specifikt, at han ikke ville gå denne vej for at skrive beslutninger, der ikke er baseret på afgjorte, ikke-kontroversielle begreber i den amerikanske forfatning ... og her har han tydeligvis gjort præcis det modsatte af det.<br/><br/>Den virkelige skyld bør være på skuldrene af de piksugere i SENATE, der bekræftede den skiderik i første omgang, om, at de ikke ville stemme imod hans bekræftelse, fordi de gemte deres ammunition til virkelige trusler til os.<br/><br/>Jeg bebrejder de skide idioter mere, end jeg bebrejder den løgnagtige bunke af lort ved navn Roberts, idioter som Schumer og det andet røvhul fra Illinois, og det løgnagtige zionistiske svin Levin fra Michigan. Et par af dem kunne have stoppet bekræftelsen af Alito og Roberts, men de lod det glide.<br/><br/>Påstanden om, at alt dette faktisk er vinduesdressing, er korrekt, og sandheden er, selv om det åbenlyst er en krænkelse af vores rettigheder over hele linjen, er disse afskum i SCOTUS kun postfaktum og hævder den skruning, de gjorde mod os i lang, lang, lang tid.<br/><br/>Sandheden er, at det aldrig betød noget, hvad vi troede foregik, fordi selskaber har fungeret godt uden for loven i lang tid nu, og ingen har holdt dem ansvarlige. De selvsamme bastarder, der sidder på SCOTUS, er velgørere af de virksomheders forseelser og grådighed, der giver dem tilbageslag for deres beslutninger i form af STOCK DIVIDENDS.<br/><br/>Desværre, med fokus på den korrupte SCOTUS hjælper os ikke meget. Det er som at sige det indlysende, og forventer det at være strafbart, når det ikke er.<br/><br/>Vi er på røven, uanset hvordan vi ser på det, men der vil være en forsoningsdag. Når de tager væk hver eneste rest af personlig værdighed for hele middelklassen i dette land, vil der være helvede at betale.

Prøv at tænke mere i form af den konstitutionalistiske klasse end "middelklassen", som deres lingvister foretrækker. Det virker bedre, imo, at smide dem ud af deres gameplans.<br/><br/>Det, der sker nu, er en fremskyndelse af Sheeples erkendelse af, at noget er alvorligt galt, og at facaden og illusionen er tynd og falder ned, hvilket afslører det grimme, multi-tentacled ROTHSCHILD bæst bag korporatokratiet skub for mere magt og absolut styre.<br/><br/>som 'middle class' eller hvad du vil kalde det, bliver mere og mere decimeret og ødelagt, i sidste ende nok Sheeple vil have vågnet til det punkt, hvor de indser det er enten stå op og kæmpe eller dø på alle fire.<br/><br/>systemet ROTHSCHILDS kollapser i sig selv, på grund af alt for meget ude af kontrol, ukontrolleret GRØD, og nu er det som en høj bygning, der går frem og tilbage som et pendul i et jordskælv, på et tidspunkt vil det endelig 'snap' og falde. Vi er i slutningen spil, som du vil, af demokrati og faux økonomiske system, der blev begået på alle, så der er en kollision med virkeligheden ved at ske temmelig snart, og det vil ikke være smuk.<br/><br/>Hvis jeg var SCOTUS, ville jeg være sikker på, at de biz jets er drevet, piloter står ved, for deres sidste PARAGUAYAN tur til Bush compound, hvor de vil gemme sig, når ballonen endelig går op her.<br/><br/>men i stigende grad ser det ud til, at de presser hårdt på for tredje verdenskrig for at tage alles øjne fra sindet, der blæser, utrolige HUBRIS af deres ilk.<br/><br/>En regnskabets dag kommer, og det bliver ikke pænt.<br/><br/>Kommentar af hvad jeg tror sker nu er dette ..<br/>2. februar 2010<br/>Besvar<br/><br/>Jeg er enig i, at de kollapsende systemer er deres, ikke Amerikas, og tjek dette link fra Rense.com:<br/><br/>Ser lidt ud som det grimme, multi tentacled ROTHSCHILD bæst bag korporatokratiet forsøger at forklæde sig som en offshore olieplatform eller noget, gør det ikke?<br/><br/>I deres fremstød for tredje verdenskrig presser de også på for et oprør her for at smide forfatningen ud i fortvivlelse og foragt, så de kan erstatte den med deres egne designs.<br/><br/>I min egen idé og forståelse skal der være begrænsninger på, hvad der udgør tale for at forhindre en bastardisering af udtrykket og en alt for liberal fortolkning af det første ændringsforslag.<br/><br/>Vi behøver ikke at komme til spørgsmålet, om regeringen har en overbevisende interesse i at forhindre udenlandske individer eller foreninger i at påvirke vores nations politiske proces. Jf. 2 U.S.C. 441e (bidrags- og udgiftsforbud gælder for "udenlandske[s]"). Sektion 441b er ikke begrænset til selskaber eller foreninger, der blev oprettet i udlandet eller finansieret overvejende af udenlandske aktionærer.

Vi havde ikke mere guld til at betale for det papir, vi lånte fra FED. Det er nu i en årlig konkurs rollover. Regeringen er nu privat som BLACKWATER.

Alle forretninger ved domstolene i dag er virksomhedernes betydning, at vi betragtes som individuelle virksomheder. Vi eksisterer ved kontrakt med staten. Husk den 14. ændring. Der var ingen amerikanske statsborgere før det. De fleste af os har uforvarende hævdet amerikansk virksomhedsborgerskab. Vi er nødt til at adressere reglen af bankeliten.

| And so the TWEWY Spriting Thread army set off, their destination being Japan. Unfortunately, no airline whatsoever would let them on board because of their rather large amassment of weapons of moderate destruction. And pitchtorches, which constituted both a fire and a stabbing hazard. And so, they just went home and downloaded the movie Kanon wanted to watch illegally. They gave it 7/10 stars on rotten tomatoes. The End.<br/><br/>Spoiler:The bottom right Sprite is the new one.<br/><br/>Highlight this box with your cursor to read the spoiler text. Yes, he's using a sword. I like to be boring and generic like that. Besides, no one else took the easy, predictable route, so somebody had to.

Besides, no one else took the easy, predictable route, so somebody had to. Peace out.<br/><br/>The first sprite was half made by me. The second row contains a teaser for the continuation of the clown sprites i made a while back. And the third row is just a few old sprites that i decided to fix up and redo some parts.<br/><br/>So I just joined, and tried to make a sprite, it turned out ok, but it seemed like a lot of work, and I only made a few changes to neku. How do you make the complicated ones?<br/><br/>Spoiler:<br/><br/>Highlight this box with your cursor to read the spoiler text.<br/><br/>Spoiler:<br/><br/>How to get better at spriting:<br/><br/>1. To start off, master the art of recoloring sprites and shading. 2. Next start copying and pasting body parts to other sprites. E.x Take the arm band off of neku and put it on joshua. 3. Start small by switching around body parts and re-coloring them. (in other words, just experiment and see which combo you like) 4. Then start to challenging yourself to make more complex sprites. Instead of copying and pasting and recoloring, you can try and draw clothes or faces. 5. PRACTICE PRACTICE AND MORE PRACTICE. Keep practicing and experimenting and never give upPeace out.<br/><br/>Sometimes people need to be reminded not to give up so easily and continue to persist. | Og så startede TWEWY Spriting Thread-hæren, deres destination var Japan. Desværre ville intet flyselskab overhovedet lade dem ombord på grund af deres ret store samling af våben med moderat ødelæggelse. Og pitchtorches, som udgjorde både en brand og en stikkende fare. Og så, de bare gik hjem og downloadede filmen Kanon ønskede at se ulovligt. De gav det 7/10 stjerner på rådne tomater.

Start små ved at skifte rundt kropsdele og re-farvning dem. (Med andre ord, bare eksperimentere og se, hvilken combo du kan lide) 4. Begynd derefter at udfordre dig selv til at lave mere komplekse sprites. I stedet for at kopiere og indsætte og omfarve, kan du prøve at tegne tøj eller ansigter. 5. PRAKTISK PRAKSIS OG MERE PRAKSIS.

| Interpretive Summary: This book chapter reviews various aspects of what is needed for the selection of model weeds to answer questions pertinent to weed science. Specifically, the chapter covers why we need model species, attributes of model species, and provides the current state of knowledge and resources that have been developed for a few key weeds such as leafy spurge, Canada thistle, waterhemp, and purple false brome that may make them good potential models.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract:<br/>Selection of a limited number of model weeds and development of genomic-based tools and resources will facilitate studies on the ecology, biology, physiology and development of weedy species. Such studies will help answer fundamental questions of concern to weed scientists. However, to ensure the weed science community can appropriately and fully utilize these model weeds, they will need to be carefully selected. Various attributes such as ease of study, weedy characteristics, and importance as a weedy species will need to be considered. Additionally, the availability of existing genomic resources can be used to extend the list of viable model weeds. Several resources have also been developed specifically for weeds such as leafy spurge, Canada thistle, waterhemp, and purple false brome. | Denne bog kapitel gennemgår forskellige aspekter af, hvad der er nødvendigt for udvælgelsen af model ukrudt til at besvare spørgsmål, der er relevante for ukrudt videnskab. Specifikt dækker kapitlet, hvorfor vi har brug for modelarter, attributter af modelarter, og giver den nuværende viden og ressourcer, der er udviklet til et par vigtige ukrudt som løvrige spurge, Canada tistel, vandhamp og lilla falsk brom, der kan gøre dem til gode potentielle modeller.<br/><br/>Teknisk abstract:<br/>Udvælgelse af et begrænset antal modelukrudt og udvikling af genombaserede værktøjer og ressourcer vil lette undersøgelser af økologi, biologi, fysiologi og udvikling af ukrudtsarter. Sådanne undersøgelser vil hjælpe med at besvare grundlæggende spørgsmål af bekymring for ukrudtsforskere. Men for at sikre, at ukrudtsvidenskabssamfundet kan udnytte disse modelukrudt korrekt og fuldt ud, skal de vælges omhyggeligt. Forskellige attributter såsom nem undersøgelse, ukrudtsagtige egenskaber og betydning som en ukrudtsart skal overvejes. Derudover kan tilgængeligheden af eksisterende genomiske ressourcer bruges til at udvide listen over levedygtige modelukrudt. Flere ressourcer er også blevet udviklet specielt til ukrudt såsom løvrige spurge, Canada tistel, vandhamp og lilla falsk brom. |
