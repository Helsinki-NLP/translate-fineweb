| Forty-nine years ago today, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act of 1965.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Nearly a century ago, the 15th Amendment to the Constitution stated, "The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of race, color or previous condition of servitude." And nearly a century before that, our nation's founding fathers set in motion the great experiment of American democracy by declaring that "all men are created equal."<br/><br/>The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was a belated acknowledgment that even in America, our foundational ideals carry little weight if not protected by the rule of law. That's why Section 2 of the 15th Amendment granted Congress the "power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation."<br/><br/>And indeed, the codified language of the Voting Rights Act was able to achieve what the Reconstruction-era Congress and Thomas Jefferson could not. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act—and the civil rights movement from which they emerged—served as the catalyst for a dramatic increase in the opportunity for black Americans to participate in the democratic process.<br/><br/>For example, only 6.7 percent of eligible black Mississippians were registered to vote as of 1962; by 1969 that figure had reached 66.5 percent. Today, Mississippi has more black elected officials than any other state.<br/><br/>The protections put in place by the Voting Rights Act were long overdue when they were passed, representative of the arduous struggle with which they were achieved. But unthinkably, these protections are now under assault, jeopardizing the progress our nation worked so hard to achieve.<br/><br/>Last year, in the case of Shelby County v. Holder, the U.S. Supreme Court gutted a key component of the Voting Rights Act that enabled prior federal review to ensure nondiscrimination before any new voting law went into effect.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Sadly, the response of Republican leaders has been to do nothing. Sen. Ted Cruz and Gov. Rick Perry went out of their way to praise the Supreme Court's decision. Sen. Rand Paul dismissed the continued necessity of the Voting Rights Act by noting, "We have an African-American president."<br/><br/>While the election of President Barack Obama was indeed a historic milestone, it is dangerous to think that it absolves us from remaining vigilant against the lingering consequences of our nation's past. The haste with which states have moved to enact voting restrictions is confirmation that the protections put in place by Section 4 are still necessary.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Republican governors have signed strict photo-identification restrictions into law as the solution to a virtually nonexistent problem of voter impersonation, disproportionately hurting women, young people, working families and the African-American community. It's disingenuous for Republicans like Paul to seek the votes of these communities when they believe "there's nothing wrong with" putting restrictions in place that make it harder for these constituencies to vote.<br/><br/>Republicans have also sought to restrict early-voting periods, including the Sunday before Election Day, when African-American churches have had great success with Souls to the Polls programs.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>These restrictions represent a callous effort by Republicans to make voting harder, based on narrow, short-term political calculations that Republicans can win elections by shrinking the size of the electorate.<br/><br/>Democrats have a very different mission when it comes to voting: to ensure that every eligible voter can register, that every registered voter can vote and that every vote is accurately counted.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>The Democratic National Committee's Voter Expansion Project reflects our belief that greater voter participation strengthens our nation and our democracy. We'll continue to use our unmatched institutional knowledge to protect voting rights against legislation and tactics that would attempt to suppress the vote. And because the best defense is a good offense, we're also working to expand the vote by deploying our technology and data resources to register new voters.<br/><br/>On this anniversary, one of the best ways we can honor those who struggled—and in some cases gave their very lives—for the legislation's passage is for Republicans in Congress to join Democrats in passing the Voting Rights Amendment Act to restore the promise of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Democrat, represents Florida's 23rd Congressional District in the United States Congress. Since 2011, she has served as chair of the Democratic National Committee. Follow her on Twitter.<br/><br/>The Root aims to foster and advance conversations about issues relevant to the black Diaspora by presenting a variety of opinions from all perspectives, whether or not those opinions are shared by our editorial staff. | I dag er det 49 år siden, at præsident Lyndon B. Johnson underskrev Voting Rights Act of 1965.<br/><br/>Annonce<br/><br/>For næsten et århundrede siden fastslog det 15. tillæg til forfatningen: "Retten for borgere i USA til at stemme må ikke nægtes eller forkortes af USA eller af nogen stat på grund af race, farve eller tidligere tilstand af trældom." Og næsten et århundrede før det satte vores nations grundlæggere det store eksperiment af amerikansk demokrati i gang ved at erklære, at "alle mennesker er skabt lige."<br/><br/>The Voting Rights Act of 1965 var en forsinket anerkendelse af, at selv i Amerika, vores grundlæggende idealer bære lidt vægt, hvis ikke beskyttet af retsstatsprincippet. Afsnit 2 i den 15. tilføjelse gav Kongressen "beføjelsen til at håndhæve denne artikel ved passende lovgivning."<br/><br/>Og faktisk var det kodificerede sprog i Voting Rights Act i stand til at opnå, hvad Reconstruction-æra kongressen og Thomas Jefferson ikke kunne. Civil Rights Act fra 1964 og Voting Rights Act - og borgerrettighedsbevægelsen, hvorfra de opstod - tjente som katalysator for en dramatisk stigning i muligheden for sorte amerikanere til at deltage i den demokratiske proces.<br/><br/>For eksempel var kun 6,7 procent af sorte Mississippianere registreret til at stemme i 1962; i 1969 var dette tal nået 66,5 procent. I dag har Mississippi flere sorte folkevalgte end nogen anden stat.<br/><br/>De beskyttelser, der blev indført ved loven om stemmerettigheder, var længe forfaldne, da de blev vedtaget, repræsentative for den vanskelige kamp, hvormed de blev opnået. Men utænkeligt er disse beskyttelser nu under angreb, hvilket bringer de fremskridt, vores nation har arbejdet så hårdt for at opnå.<br/><br/>Sidste år, i tilfælde af Shelby County v. Holder, den amerikanske højesteret sløjfet en nøglekomponent i loven om stemmerettigheder, der gjorde det muligt for forudgående føderal gennemgang for at sikre ikke-diskrimination, før enhver ny afstemningslov trådte i kraft.<br/><br/>Annonce<br/><br/>Desværre har reaktionen fra republikanske ledere været at gøre ingenting. Senator Ted Cruz og guvernør Rick Perry gik ud af deres måde at rose højesterets afgørelse. Senator Rand Paul afviste den fortsatte nødvendighed af Voting Rights Act ved at bemærke, "Vi har en afrikansk-amerikansk præsident."<br/><br/>Mens valget af præsident Barack Obama faktisk var en historisk milepæl, er det farligt at tro, at det afholder os fra at forblive årvågne over for de dvælende konsekvenser af vores nations fortid. Den hast, hvormed staterne har bevæget sig for at vedtage afstemningsrestriktioner, er en bekræftelse af, at de beskyttelser, der er indført ved bekendtgørelsens bekendtgørelse nr. 4, stadig er nødvendige.<br/><br/>Annonce<br/><br/>Republikanske guvernører har underskrevet strenge foto-identifikation restriktioner i loven som løsningen på en stort set ikke-eksisterende problem vælger efterligning, uforholdsmæssigt såre kvinder, unge, arbejderfamilier og det afrikansk-amerikanske samfund.

| Q&A: Vatican safeguarding expert Fr Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>13 June 2021<br/><br/>Fr Hans Zollner SJ. Image: Australian Jesuits.<br/><br/>The President of the Centre for Child Protection at the Gregorian University in Rome, and a member of the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors, Fr Hans Zollner SJ, was in Australia in 2018 to speak to Catholic ministry leaders and survivors.<br/><br/>Michael McVeigh from Jesuit Communications sat down with him during the visit to explore how the Church is responding to the abuse crisis internationally, and what can be learned from our experiences in Australia.<br/><br/>MM: This is your third trip to Australia. You've visited quite a few other countries to see how the Church is responding to abuse around the world. Can you give us some idea of what the global picture looks like?<br/><br/>Fr Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>HZ: My understanding, after having visited about 50 countries on five or six continents, is that the Church is really starting to move over the last couple of years on the issue of doing justice to victims, of listening to them, and doing whatever can be done in terms of safeguarding.<br/><br/>I was with the Jesuit Provincials from all over Africa at the end of April, and the President of the Jesuit Assistancy of Africa and Madagascar is very much committed and dedicated to this. He has put up a thorough action plan for formation and for introducing guidelines all over the place. It's a very considerate and very deliberate effort to do whatever can be done to be proactively engaged as Jesuits in Africa — in a continent where until a few years ago all of this was a foreign language.<br/><br/>One of the challenges of trying to develop this global approach is that you're dealing with so many cultures, and so many different understandings. How do you bring this together and try to provide training and support religious communities tackling these issues?<br/><br/>This is one of the major questions we have. I think what I can do is stimulate discussion, stimulate reflection, and prepare people as much as possible so that they can do the groundwork.<br/><br/>The Centre for Child Protection at the Gregorian University does not pretend to have the response to every question. Not only because we don't know the specific contexts — we might know a few of them, but we're talking about thousands of cultures, we're talking about hundreds of languages, we're talking about very diverse legal backgrounds. It varies even sometimes within one country, such as Australia where you have states within the Commonwealth of Australia that have different laws than other states.<br/><br/>I am somebody who tries to elicit and stimulate discussion and reflection. I'm also very happy to listen to people.<br/><br/>You mentioned the need to listen and support victims in being heard. We've obviously had the Royal Commission here in Australia, but what are some of the other ways that you've seen that the voices of victims are being supported around the world?<br/><br/>In France there is one diocese that has established what they call 'The Listening Space'. There, victims can come forward and they can express themselves. The bishop is present. It's an open space in which people who have been hurt tremendously are free at least to express what they want to ask from the Church leadership etc.<br/><br/>There are other places in the USA or in other countries where victims have been invited by dioceses, by Provinces, by the leadership of the Church, to come forward. I have to say that overall I think there is a good will, and there are more people like bishops and provincials who listen to victims than we know. But there is no one model of giving victims not only the space to express themselves and be listened to, but also to engage actively in Church development.<br/><br/>In terms of setting up spaces for support for victims, what are some of the things you've seen that could really help — and that we could be considering here in Australia?<br/><br/>One of the major points that many victims bring up is, 'Can't we have, within parish settings, within schools settings, a regular conversation going on that includes survivors of abuse as regular members of a committee, a commission, a sounding board, a feedback group or something like that?' So that this voice is not only brought in on a specific occasion, or where a person feels like he or she is at a point to be able to speak out about it, but [is heard] on a regular basis — build that voice into the system.<br/><br/>That will help all of us. It will help survivors and victims because they will feel welcome and appreciated in the specific experience, and in the specific life challenges, that they went through. Secondly it will help the community at large, because we can at least make ourselves more and more sensitive to what the concerns and specific needs of survivors are — that can also talk to the needs of young people.<br/><br/>M: We have strong groups of survivors here in Australia who have been able to support each other through that process. But what you're saying is that we need some way of supporting those groups, and supporting those people, through our own institutions as well?<br/><br/>And I think we need to be creative. It will work for one school and one parish and one diocese in one way, and for others in a different way. Because the survivors with whom I am in constant contact, they have quite similar requests, and similar experiences in regard to being welcomed in the Church or not — feeling thrown out or dismissed. But they have also among themselves quite different expectations. So I have learned that you have also to be very forthcoming in accepting the differences in what this specific group, or this specific survivor, wants, requests and needs.<br/><br/>M: Survivors talk about wanting to have their stories heard and acknowledged. We've had the Royal Commission here in Australia, which provided an independent process where victims could come forward. Is there a need for something like that in terms of a truth, justice and reconciliation process for the Church internationally?<br/><br/>H: Yes, I think there is a need for that internationally. But I think first every local church needs to do its own homework. I don't see it happening very soon that some such council or commission would be established to look into this area for the whole Church. The Church has a membership of 1.3 billion people, and is present in 190 countries, with all kinds of differences in expectations concerning psychological, spiritual and financial support.<br/><br/>There is one thing that I have come across consistently in communicating with, working with and listening to victims, and that is that they want to be listened to. So if there was the feeling that victims were constantly being listened to — in Rome and elsewhere — I think that would give a great relief to many victims.<br/><br/>I think [Pope Francis'] concern, especially with regard to your question, is that the local churches do whatever they can so that victims will be listened to in that particular country. I have a list of people who want to speak to the Holy Father directly, and physically it is impossible. I was there in 2014 to translate for two German survivors who were chosen with two Irish and two English survivors when he received the six of them at home. He took the whole morning listening to them one after the other. For each one, he was there for 40 to 45 minutes. Were he to do this for every survivor he couldn't sleep anymore.<br/><br/>His example is modelling for the whole Catholic Church the way victims and survivors are received, welcomed and listened to. I think if the bishops and the provincials in this world, in all countries, followed his example, many survivors would be really appreciative of that.<br/><br/>Archbishop Diarmud Martin was recently quoted just before the World Meeting of Families, about the Pontifical Commission, saying that it's too small as it's currently set up to achieve what it needs to achieve. What's your take on that? Does the Church need to be putting more resources into how it's overseeing those issues?<br/><br/>At the moment we are 16 members from basically all continents, and the major language groups. We represent a variety of disciplines and professions, and the purpose of the commission — as the statutes that have just been promulgated state — is to provide counsel to the Holy Father.<br/><br/>A common misunderstanding about the commission is first that we deal with cases of allegations. That is not the case. We have no juridical or administrative power in regards to cases, because when it comes to allegations of abuse the tribunals and procedure are set.<br/><br/>A second misunderstanding is that we promote, directly, things on the ground. Our first and foremost goal is that we advise the Holy Father on issues.<br/><br/>So from my point of view, yes, we need to invest more. But we need to invest more on the local level, and we need to make sure that the proposals from the Pontifical Commission are forwarded to the Holy Father — which normally the President does — and then there is a follow-up process that reflects what we have given as our advice.<br/><br/>In Australia, Catholic Professional Standards Limited is overseeing the Church's response and providing guidelines and support for ensuring all the institutions in the Church are child-safe institutions. Is there a need for some kind of organisational support from Rome for those bishops and dioceses that are struggling to form these institutions and provide safeguarding in those dioceses?<br/><br/>I think ultimately the commission will develop in that line. They are now in the process of hiring experts in those areas.<br/><br/>I think the Church needs to understand that the local churches can learn from each other mutually. And my understanding has always been — and I think the Holy Father has reminded us — that the Church will not function as a centralised company. It does not work like that, effectively. Every bishop, every bishops conference, has, to some extent, its life on its own. What we need to learn more is to open channels of mutual communication.<br/><br/>There are a number of things that people blame for abuse in the Church. As a priest and a psychologist, and as someone who has met and worked with survivors, what are your thoughts on that issue?<br/><br/>I think the question of where does abuse come from is the most important one, and the Pope has addressed that in his letter to the people of God published on 20 August. He says in the first paragraph, and repeats it over and over again, that the question of sexual abuse is always linked — or almost always linked — not only to the question of abuse of power, but also to the abuse of conscience.<br/><br/>So the real fundamental question of abuse is much more complex than just [the question of] sexuality — be it heterosexual or homosexual. It's a power issue, and there we have to really work on the question of how do we understand priesthood, how to we understand bishophood, how do we understand and live out our ministries? What are the boundaries?<br/><br/>That's why I'm very happy that the Jesuit Province in Australia is establishing a Code of Conduct. Because we don't talk only about sexual abuse of minors. We talk about sexual abuse of adults, and we talk about abuse in other ways — like abuse of conscience, where you dictate to someone what you think, or you pretend to know by God, and you can tell another person, 'You need to do that', against the conscience of that person.<br/><br/>Many people think celibacy produces abuse. As I always say, celibacy as such is not cause for abusing — otherwise how do we explain that 99.9 per cent of all abusers do not live a celibate life, and how do we explain that 95 or 96 per cent of all priests do not abuse minors? But, celibacy, or a vow of chastity, that is not really integrated, that is not really lived out properly — yes, that produces a problem. Sometimes people take to drinking, sometime they take to gambling, and sometimes they take to sexual misconduct, with adults and with minors.<br/><br/>The real question about this is how do we deal with the notion of religious spiritual power with which priests and bishops are invested? How can theology help us to understand, and maybe how can sociology, psychology, or business administration help us to define the limits of power, and the necessity of keeping your boundaries | Spørgsmål og svar: Vatikanets sikkerhedsekspert Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>13. juni 2021<br/><br/>Fr Hans Zollner SJ. Billede: Australske jesuitter.<br/><br/>Præsidenten for Center for Børnebeskyttelse ved det Gregorianske Universitet i Rom og et medlem af den pavelige kommission for beskyttelse af mindreårige, Hans Zollner SJ, var i Australien i 2018 for at tale med katolske ministerledere og overlevende.<br/><br/>Michael McVeigh fra Jesuit Communications satte sig ned med ham under besøget for at undersøge, hvordan Kirken reagerer på misbrugskrisen internationalt, og hvad der kan læres af vores erfaringer i Australien.<br/><br/>MM: Dette er din tredje tur til Australien. Du har besøgt en hel del andre lande for at se, hvordan Kirken reagerer på misbrug rundt om i verden. Kan du give os en idé om, hvordan det globale billede ser ud?<br/><br/>Fr Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>HZ: Min forståelse efter at have besøgt omkring 50 lande på fem eller seks kontinenter er, at Kirken virkelig er begyndt at bevæge sig over de sidste par år i spørgsmålet om at yde ofrene retfærdighed, at lytte til dem og gøre alt, hvad der kan gøres for at beskytte dem.<br/><br/>Jeg var sammen med jesuitprovinserne fra hele Afrika i slutningen af april, og præsidenten for jesuitassistansen i Afrika og Madagaskar er meget engageret og dedikeret til dette. Han har lagt en grundig handlingsplan for dannelse og for at indføre retningslinjer overalt. Det er en meget hensynsfuld og meget bevidst indsats for at gøre, hvad der kan gøres for at være proaktivt engageret som jesuitter i Afrika - i et kontinent, hvor indtil for et par år siden alt dette var et fremmedsprog.<br/><br/>En af udfordringerne ved at forsøge at udvikle denne globale tilgang er, at du har at gøre med så mange kulturer, og så mange forskellige forståelser. Hvordan bringer du dette sammen og forsøger at give uddannelse og støtte religiøse samfund, der tackler disse problemer?<br/><br/>Det er et af de store spørgsmål, vi har. Jeg tror, at det, jeg kan gøre, er at stimulere diskussion, stimulere refleksion og forberede folk så meget som muligt, så de kan gøre grundlaget.<br/><br/>Center for Børnebeskyttelse på Gregorian University foregiver ikke at have svaret på alle spørgsmål. Ikke kun fordi vi ikke kender de specifikke sammenhænge - vi kender måske et par af dem, men vi taler om tusindvis af kulturer, vi taler om hundredvis af sprog, vi taler om meget forskellige juridiske baggrunde. Det varierer endda nogle gange inden for et land, såsom Australien, hvor du har stater inden for Commonwealth of Australia, der har forskellige love end andre stater.<br/><br/>Jeg er en person, der forsøger at fremkalde og stimulere diskussion og refleksion. Jeg er også meget glad for at lytte til folk.<br/><br/>Du nævnte behovet for at lytte og støtte ofrene i at blive hørt. Vi har naturligvis haft den kongelige kommission her i Australien, men hvad er nogle af de andre måder, du har set, at ofrenes stemmer bliver støttet rundt om i verden?<br/><br/>I Frankrig er der et stift, der har etableret det, de kalder "The Listening Space". Der kan ofrene komme frem, og de kan udtrykke sig. Biskoppen er til stede. Det er et åbent rum, hvor mennesker, der er blevet såret enormt, i det mindste er frie til at udtrykke, hvad de vil bede om fra Kirkens ledelse osv.<br/><br/>Der er andre steder i USA eller i andre lande, hvor ofrene er blevet inviteret af bispedømmer, af provinser, af Kirkens ledelse til at træde frem. Jeg må sige, at jeg generelt mener, at der er en god vilje, og der er flere mennesker som biskopper og provinser, der lytter til ofrene, end vi ved. Men der er ingen model, der giver ofrene ikke blot plads til at udtrykke sig og blive lyttet til, men også til at engagere sig aktivt i Kirkens udvikling.<br/><br/>Med hensyn til at oprette rum til støtte for ofre, hvad er nogle af de ting, du har set, der virkelig kunne hjælpe - og at vi kunne overveje her i Australien?<br/><br/>Et af de store punkter, som mange ofre bringer op, er: "Kan vi ikke inden for sogneindstillinger, inden for skoleindstillinger, en regelmæssig samtale, der foregår, der omfatter overlevende fra misbrug som regelmæssige medlemmer af et udvalg, en kommission, et lydkort, en feedbackgruppe eller sådan noget?" Så denne stemme er ikke kun bragt ind ved en bestemt lejlighed, eller hvor en person føler, at han eller hun er på et tidspunkt for at kunne tale om det, men [høres] regelmæssigt - byg den stemme ind i systemet.<br/><br/>Det vil hjælpe os alle. Det vil hjælpe overlevende og ofre, fordi de vil føle sig velkomne og værdsat i den specifikke oplevelse og i de specifikke livsudfordringer, de gik igennem. For det andet vil det hjælpe samfundet som helhed, fordi vi i det mindste kan gøre os mere og mere opmærksomme på, hvad de overlevendes bekymringer og specifikke behov er, der også kan tale til de unges behov.<br/><br/>M: Vi har stærke grupper af overlevende her i Australien, der har været i stand til at støtte hinanden gennem denne proces. Men hvad du siger er, at vi har brug for en måde at støtte disse grupper, og støtte disse mennesker, gennem vores egne institutioner så godt?<br/><br/>Og jeg tror, vi skal være kreative. Det vil fungere for en skole og et sogn og et bispedømme på en måde, og for andre på en anden måde. Fordi de overlevende, med hvem jeg er i konstant kontakt, de har ganske lignende anmodninger, og lignende erfaringer med hensyn til at blive budt velkommen i Kirken eller ej – føler smidt ud eller afskediget. Men de har også indbyrdes helt forskellige forventninger, så jeg har lært, at man også skal være meget imødekommende i at acceptere forskellene i, hvad denne specifikke gruppe, eller denne specifikke overlevende, ønsker, ønsker og behov.<br/><br/>M: Overlevende taler om at ville have deres historier hørt og anerkendt. Vi har haft den kongelige kommission her i Australien, som gav en uafhængig proces, hvor ofrene kunne komme frem. Er der behov for noget lignende i form af en sandheds-, retfærdigheds- og forsoningsproces for Kirken internationalt?<br/><br/>H: Ja, jeg tror, der er et behov for det internationalt. Men jeg tror først, at hver lokal kirke skal gøre sit eget hjemmearbejde. Jeg kan ikke se det ske meget snart, at et sådant råd eller kommission ville blive etableret for at undersøge dette område for hele Kirken. Kirken har et medlemstal på 1,3 milliarder mennesker og er til stede i 190 lande med alle mulige forskelle i forventninger til psykologisk, åndelig og økonomisk støtte.<br/><br/>Der er én ting, jeg er stødt på konsekvent i at kommunikere med, arbejde med og lytte til ofrene, og det er, at de ønsker at blive lyttet til. Så hvis der var en følelse af, at ofrene konstant blev lyttet til - i Rom og andre steder - tror jeg, at det ville være en stor lettelse for mange ofre.<br/><br/>Jeg tror, at [pave Francis'] bekymring, især med hensyn til dit spørgsmål, er, at de lokale kirker gør, hvad de kan, så ofrene vil blive lyttet til i det pågældende land. Jeg har en liste over mennesker, der ønsker at tale direkte med Den Hellige Fader, og fysisk er det umuligt. Jeg var der i 2014 for at oversætte for to tyske overlevende, der blev udvalgt med to irske og to engelske overlevende, da han modtog seks af dem derhjemme. Han tog hele formiddagen at lytte til dem den ene efter den anden. Han var der i 40-45 minutter for hver overlevende, han ikke kunne sove mere.<br/><br/>Hans eksempel er at modellere for hele den katolske kirke, hvordan ofre og overlevende modtages, bydes velkommen og lyttes til. Jeg tror, at hvis biskopperne og provinserne i denne verden, i alle lande, fulgte hans eksempel, ville mange overlevende være virkelig taknemmelige for det.<br/><br/>ærkebiskop Diarmud Martin blev for nylig citeret lige før World Meeting of Families, om den pavelige kommission, der siger, at den er for lille, da den i øjeblikket er oprettet til at opnå, hvad den skal opnå. Hvad er din opfattelse af det? Behøver kirken at bruge flere ressourcer på, hvordan den fører tilsyn med disse spørgsmål?<br/><br/>I øjeblikket er vi 16 medlemmer fra stort set alle kontinenter, og de store sproggrupper. Vi repræsenterer en række discipliner og erhverv, og formålet med kommissionen - som de vedtægter, der netop er blevet bekendtgjort stat - er at give råd til den hellige Fader.<br/><br/>En almindelig misforståelse om Kommissionen er først og fremmest, at vi behandler sager om påstande. Vi har ingen juridiske eller administrative beføjelser i forbindelse med sager, for når det drejer sig om påstande om misbrug, fastlægges domstole og procedurer.<br/><br/>En anden misforståelse er, at vi fremmer, direkte, ting på jorden. Vores første og vigtigste mål er, at vi rådgiver Den Hellige Fader om spørgsmål.<br/><br/>Så fra mit synspunkt, ja, vi er nødt til at investere mere. Men vi er nødt til at investere mere på lokalt plan, og vi er nødt til at sørge for, at forslagene fra den pavelige kommission sendes til Den Hellige Fader - hvilket formanden normalt gør - og så er der en opfølgningsproces, der afspejler det, vi har givet som vores råd.<br/><br/>I Australien fører Catholic Professional Standards Limited tilsyn med Kirkens reaktion og giver retningslinjer og støtte til at sikre, at alle institutioner i Kirken er børnesikrede institutioner. Er der behov for en eller anden form for organisatorisk støtte fra Rom til de biskopper og bispedømmer, der kæmper for at danne disse institutioner og yde beskyttelse i disse bispedømmer?<br/><br/>Jeg tror, at Kommissionen i sidste ende vil udvikle sig i den retning, og at de nu er i færd med at ansætte eksperter på disse områder.<br/><br/>Jeg tror, at Kirken har brug for at forstå, at de lokale kirker kan lære af hinanden. Og min forståelse har altid været - og jeg tror, at Den Hellige Fader har mindet os - at Kirken ikke vil fungere som en centraliseret virksomhed. Det virker ikke sådan, effektivt. Hver biskop, hver biskopkonference, har til en vis grad sit eget liv. Hvad vi har brug for at lære mere er at åbne kanaler for gensidig kommunikation.<br/><br/>Der er en række ting, som folk bebrejder for misbrug i Kirken. Som præst og psykolog, og som en person, der har mødt og arbejdet med overlevende, hvad er dine tanker om dette spørgsmål?<br/><br/>Jeg mener, at spørgsmålet om, hvor misbruget kommer fra, er det vigtigste, og det har paven henvendt sig til i sit brev til Guds folk, som blev offentliggjort den 20. august. Han siger i første afsnit, og gentager det igen og igen, at spørgsmålet om seksuelt misbrug altid er forbundet - eller næsten altid forbundet - ikke kun med spørgsmålet om magtmisbrug, men også med samvittighedsmisbrug.<br/><br/>Så det virkelige grundlæggende spørgsmål om misbrug er meget mere komplekst end blot seksualitet - det være sig heteroseksuel eller homoseksuel. Det er et magtspørgsmål, og der skal vi virkelig arbejde på spørgsmålet om, hvordan vi forstår præstedømmet, hvordan vi forstår biskoppen, hvordan vi forstår og lever ud vores ministerier? Hvad er grænserne?<br/><br/>Derfor er jeg meget glad for, at jesuitprovinsen i Australien etablerer et adfærdskodeks, fordi vi ikke kun taler om seksuelt misbrug af mindreårige. Vi taler om seksuelt misbrug af voksne, og vi taler om misbrug på andre måder - som samvittighedsmisbrug, hvor du dikterer nogen, hvad du synes, eller du foregiver at vide af Gud, og du kan fortælle en anden person, "Du skal gøre det", mod den persons samvittighed.<br/><br/>Mange tror, at cølibat forårsager misbrug. Som jeg altid siger, er cølibat som sådan ikke årsag til misbrug - ellers hvordan forklarer vi, at 99,9 procent af alle misbrugere ikke lever et cølibatliv, og hvordan forklarer vi, at 95 eller 96 procent af alle præster ikke misbruger mindreårige? Men, cølibat, eller et løfte om kyskhed, der ikke er virkelig integreret, der er ikke rigtig levet ud ordentligt, ja, der producerer et problem. Nogle gange tager folk til at drikke, andre gange tager de til gambling, og nogle gange tager de til seksuel misbrug, med voksne og med mindreårige.<br/><br/>Det virkelige spørgsmål er, hvordan vi håndterer begrebet religiøs spirituel magt, som præster og biskopper er investeret i? Hvordan kan teologi hjælpe os til at forstå, og måske hvordan kan sociologi, psykologi eller business administration hjælpe os til at definere grænserne for magt, og nødvendigheden af at holde dine grænser |
| I'm not surprised by this mismatch. In fact, I'd even go so far as to say this isn't something that will ever change, nor should we get all steamed up about changing it. In 10 years, we'll still have bleeding edge, complex items in the biggest concerns list, and the things we're finally getting around to understanding will be the major parts of our spending.<br/><br/>Now, Gunnar and Andy both have excellent points, specifically about IT teams seeing IT problems and solving them with IT solutions; in fact, I'm positive their points hold merit.<br/><br/>But I think there are other ideas that trump those (I did comment on their blogs about it, and later decided I should just blog here). Those top 3 concerns are bleedingly new such that:<br/><br/>we fear new things because we don't understand them, or don't understand them because they're new.<br/><br/>they're too new for us to have solid approaches to handling them.<br/><br/>they're too new for us to know if we should be worried or not! we tend to default to paranoid/worried, which is good!<br/><br/>too new to have obvious budget items assigned to them. Can I buy a box or some software that provide "cloud security" or "social media security?"<br/><br/>they're so new the business doesn't even know how to use them or what they want out of them. Let alone how we can secure them while still meeting or at least not stomping all over business needs. If the business doesn't even know how to use them yet, I'm not sure security is in any position to guide that usage securely.<br/><br/>It also should be mentioned that these new things are being largely pushed via consumerland and into the business, with IT as a sort of, "Oh yeah," thought. Firewalls, AV, AM, Auth are all IT responses to typically IT issues. Of course there is a difference there. They're also very subjective issues, as opposed to very objective items like firewalls, known malicious bits, behaviors, signatures, ports. Business presents very complex issues that are often involving people (which we can't patch) and that often don't fit nicely into blanket rules. Even if we turned away from technical solutions and devoted our time into solving these problems, they are still not going to be neatly solved. Likewise, when push comes to shove, can you have and meet goals with firewalls? Can you show improvement? All of this flows from the rather subjective non-technical aspect of those issues. Sort of the difference between a child's report card and the feedback you get from a parent-teacher conference. If you have a child, which one would you be most inclined to disagree with or not necessarily believe? (The answer is the subjective one!)<br/><br/>It could be said this is the natural progression of security and technology: from shoring up the technical controls to moving up the stack towards behavior and people. Sure, these 3 top concerns can be said to punch through firewalls and network segments, but that's the nature of those things (social media "punching" through a firewall is far different than me punching through an SSH connection to bridge my home network; social media is akin to the *way* I use my SSH connection after the hold is already punched because it is needed; i.e. social media is the way port 80 is used.)<br/><br/>Basically, all indications point to not being surprised by this dichotomy. And I don't think this is some further indication that IT/security is doing it wrong, or isn't aligned properly with business, or has a technical dark-server-room background. I'm not saying we're doing things right or we're properly aligned, but the above isn't a good argument to support the theory of those deficiencies.<br/><br/>Now for a really big jump. I'd liken the current increase in mobile computing to be as big as the introduction of computers into the business and later the PC/internet into business. Now, I wasn't around when the former happened, nor was I in the industry when the personal computer revolution swept into business, but I would bet that is the closest comparison so far. I may even say the same for social media. These are damned new and they're big changes beyond just bringing in Macs or new software or some new business process. | Jeg er ikke overrasket over denne mismatch. Faktisk vil jeg endda gå så langt som at sige, at dette ikke er noget, der nogensinde vil ændre sig, og vi bør heller ikke få alle dampet op om at ændre det. Om 10 år vil vi stadig have blødende kant, komplekse elementer i den største bekymringsliste, og de ting, vi endelig kommer rundt til at forstå, vil være de store dele af vores udgifter.<br/><br/>Nu har Gunnar og Andy begge gode pointer, især om it-teams, der ser it-problemer og løser dem med it-løsninger; faktisk er jeg sikker på, at deres pointer har fortjeneste.<br/><br/>Men jeg tror, der er andre ideer, der trumfer dem (jeg kommenterede deres blogs om det, og senere besluttede jeg, at jeg bare skulle blogge her). Disse top 3 bekymringer er blødende nye, således at:<br/><br/>Vi frygter nye ting, fordi vi ikke forstår dem, eller ikke forstår dem, fordi de er nye.<br/><br/>De er for nye til, at vi kan håndtere dem.<br/><br/>de er for nye for os at vide, om vi skal være bekymrede eller ej! vi har tendens til at standard til paranoid / bekymret, hvilket er godt!<br/><br/>for ny til at have indlysende budgetposter tildelt dem. Kan jeg købe en kasse eller noget software, der giver "cloud sikkerhed" eller "sociale medier sikkerhed?"<br/><br/>de er så nye, at virksomheden ikke engang ved, hvordan de skal bruge dem eller hvad de vil have ud af dem. For slet ikke at tale om, hvordan vi kan sikre dem, mens vi stadig opfylder eller i det mindste ikke tramper hele forretningsbehovet. Hvis virksomheden ikke engang ved, hvordan man bruger dem endnu, er jeg ikke sikker på, at sikkerheden er i stand til at styre denne brug sikkert.<br/><br/>Det skal også nævnes, at disse nye ting i høj grad bliver skubbet via consumerland og ind i virksomheden, med it som en slags, "Oh yeah", tænkte. Firewalls, AV, AM, Auth er alle it-svar på typisk it-problemer. Selvfølgelig er der en forskel der. De er også meget subjektive problemer, i modsætning til meget objektive elementer som firewalls, kendte ondsindede bits, adfærd, signaturer, porte. Forretningen præsenterer meget komplekse problemer, der ofte involverer mennesker (som vi ikke kan lappe), og som ofte ikke passer godt ind i tæpperegler. Selvom vi vendte os væk fra tekniske løsninger og brugte vores tid på at løse disse problemer, vil de stadig ikke blive pænt løst. Ligeledes, når push kommer til at skubbe, kan du have og opfylde mål med firewalls? Kan du vise forbedring? Alt dette flyder fra det ret subjektive ikke-tekniske aspekt af disse spørgsmål. Sort af forskellen mellem et barns rapportkort og den feedback, du får fra en forældre-lærer-konference. Hvis du har et barn, hvilket ville du være mest tilbøjelig til at være uenig med eller ikke nødvendigvis tro på? (Svaret er det subjektive!)<br/><br/>Det kan siges, at dette er den naturlige progression af sikkerhed og teknologi: fra opgradering af de tekniske kontroller til at flytte op i stakken mod adfærd og mennesker. Sikker på, at disse 3 øverste bekymringer kan siges at slå gennem firewalls og netværkssegmenter, men det er karakteren af disse ting (sociale medier "punching" gennem en firewall er langt anderledes end mig stansning gennem en SSH-forbindelse for at bygge bro over mit hjemmenetværk; sociale medier er beslægtet med den * måde * jeg bruger min SSH-forbindelse, efter at holdet allerede er slået, fordi det er nødvendigt; dvs.<br/><br/>Dybest set peger alle indikationer på ikke at blive overrasket over denne dikotomi. Og jeg tror ikke, at dette er en yderligere indikation af, at it / sikkerhed gør det forkert, eller ikke er korrekt tilpasset erhvervslivet, eller har en teknisk mørk server-rum baggrund. Jeg siger ikke, at vi gør tingene rigtigt, eller vi er korrekt justeret, men ovenstående er ikke et godt argument til støtte for teorien om disse mangler.<br/><br/>Nu til et virkelig stort spring. Jeg vil gerne have den nuværende stigning i mobil computing til at være lige så stor som indførelsen af computere i virksomheden og senere pc / internet i erhvervslivet. Nu var jeg ikke i nærheden, da det førstnævnte skete, og jeg var heller ikke i branchen, da pc-revolutionen fejede ind i erhvervslivet, men jeg vil vædde på, at det er den nærmeste sammenligning hidtil. Jeg kan endda sige det samme for sociale medier. Disse er forbandet nye, og de er store ændringer ud over bare at bringe i Macs eller ny software eller nogle nye forretningsprocesser. |
