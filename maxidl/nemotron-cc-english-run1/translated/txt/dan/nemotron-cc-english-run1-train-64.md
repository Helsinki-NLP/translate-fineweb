| Smith Chuck - Through the Bible C2000 SeriesShall we turn to the book of Acts, chapter one, as we begin our study of the early church.<br/>Luke, the author of the book of Acts, a companion of Paul the apostle, who was author also of the Gospel According to Luke, wrote these two treatises to a friend, Theophilus. Theophilus is a Greek name. It's a name that has a beautiful meaning. The name means lover of God. There are some who believe that it was not a man at all, but that the gospel and the book of Acts were addressed to the lovers of God, whoever you may be. There are other traditions that say that Theophilus was actually Luke's master. That in those days physicians were slaves, usually the slave of a wealthy patron. So that Luke's master was Theophilus, and he released Luke to be with Paul on the missionary journeys. Thus, Luke is writing back to his former master. This is an early tradition of the church, but it is, of course, impossible to prove, like so many of the traditions.<br/>There are also those who believe that when Paul was in Troas and he received a vision of a man calling unto him saying, "Come over to Macedonia and help us," that that man in Paul's vision was none other than Luke. For the first one that Paul really met when he came to Macedonia was Luke. And as we are in the book of Acts, you will find that when we get to that portion of the book of Acts, Luke begins to write more in the first person rather than the third person. So it is, evidently, at this particular point in the Acts of the Apostles that Luke became a companion of Paul and began to journey with him. He began to use the pronouns "we" and "us" instead of "they" and "them." This is, no doubt, where Luke became a participant and an eyewitness of those things that were happening from this point on. We will bring this out to you when we get to that point.<br/>He begins the Acts of the Apostles by tying it with the Gospel According to Luke. It is interesting that the very last thing that Luke records in his gospel is the very first thing he records in the Acts of the Apostles. We find the gospel of Luke closing as Jesus is telling His disciples to wait in Jerusalem until they be endued with power from on high. And then Jesus ascended up into heaven, and so he closes the gospel. In opening the Acts of the Apostles, he writes,<br/>The former treatise [that is, the Gospel According to Luke,] have I written unto you, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and teach ( Act 1:1 ),<br/>The key word is began. The Gospel According to Luke is not the full story of the ministry of Jesus Christ. It is only the beginning of the ministry of Jesus Christ. Jesus continues to minister to the needs of people. Jesus continues to heal the sick. Jesus continues to raise the dead. Jesus continues to minister His love and His gospel to the world, only now He is ministering through those disciples who have been anointed with His Holy Spirit. But the ministry of Christ is continuing; basically, is the premise that Luke takes in the Acts of the Apostles. The former treatise of all that Jesus began, both to do and to teach.<br/>Now because of that, the Acts of the Apostles is an unfinished book: in that the Lord today continues to work through the lives of those who have dedicated themselves to be the instruments of God. To be led and guided and anointed by His Holy Spirit, to continue the ministry of Jesus in the world today. Now God has ordained that His work should be accomplished through human instruments. I do not say that it must be accomplished. God can use angelic beings for His work, and there will come a time, during the book of Revelation when God will use angels to proclaim His gospel to people all over the world. Revelation, chapter 14, "The first angel flying through the midst of heaven having the everlasting gospel" ( Rev 14:6 ). But at the present time, God has chosen to use human instruments. As imperfect as they may be, yet that's what God has ordained to use. The exciting thing about that is, God will use me and God will use you. So many times, we're begging off, "O Lord, I can't speak. I've never been able to speak before or even now, Lord." As Moses tried to beg off the call of God. Jeremiah said, "Lord, I'm just a kid; no one's going to listen to me." And we all have our excuses why we can't be used. Don't we? We all know the reasons why God couldn't use us.<br/>One time, as the Lord was calling a prophet to do His work, he said, "Lord, send whoever you want." The Lord said, "Hey, I've called you." "Lord, good idea; send whoever you want." So often we're in that position, "Lord, send by the hand of whomsoever you will, anybody but me Lord." And yet, God has ordained to use us.<br/>Now, each of us can show our own imperfections. Each of us can point out our own inabilities, and all of us can find an excuse why God wouldn't want to use me. But yet, God has chosen to use you. That through your life He might reveal Himself to a needy world. You wonder when God has such instruments to use how He ever got the job done, don't you?<br/>Until the day in which he was taken up, after that he through the Holy Spirit had given commandments to the apostles whom he had chosen ( Act 1:2 ):<br/>That is what he ended the Gospel of Luke with. The day that Jesus was taken up, after He had told the apostles to wait for the endowment of power.<br/>To whom he also [that is the apostles he also] showed himself alive to them after his passion [or death] by many infallible proofs ( Act 1:3 ),<br/>It is difficult to deny the fact of the resurrection of Jesus Christ. I was amused, as well as annoyed and irritated, by an article I read in the Santa Ana Register this last Saturday. Of the creation science and evolutionary theories being presented in the county schools. How that, this one professor said that he teaches a science class, and thus, they deal only in facts, and that they don't have any place for theories. Because science is based upon fact and creation is based upon religious superstitions. It takes a lot of faith to believe the religious theories. When you are dealing with facts, you can just accept them. I thought, "Very interesting in that science class, they taught me it was a fact that the world was four billion years old. Now today they are teaching it's a fact that the world is twelve billion years old. And it wasn't that long ago that I went to school."<br/>It's interesting that the Bible has never needed to be revised or updated to meet the current data that men have discovered. And yet, if you would take my high school science textbooks today and try to teach a science class from them, you would find that many of the things that were taught as scientific fact when I was in high school are no longer recognized as scientific fact. The simple cell protoplasm is no longer a simple cell, but extremely complex. If there is any fact that can be attested to in history it is the fact of the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.<br/>We have a jurisprudence system that is based upon the testimony of witnesses. If a man is accused of a crime and there are people who witnessed that crime while it was being committed, and they are brought to the standard, and they swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help them God. And in their questioning they affirm that, "I saw that man in the bank on May twenty-third. I saw him pull out a gun from his coat. I heard him demand that all of the money be given to him. I saw him as he left the bank. I saw him as the officer apprehended him outside." And if you can get three or four witnesses to point to that man and will keep their testimony under cross-examination, that man is judged to be guilty. He is the one who did it. We have two or three witnesses that are testifying the same story about that man, and it is accepted as fact that he is the one who perpetrated the crime and is guilty. You've got witnesses who have sworn to tell the truth that are verifying.<br/>After the death of Jesus, when He rose again, He appeared unto many different people who gave sworn testimony that they saw Him. That they talked to Him, that He appeared to them in various places under different circumstances. And for a period of forty days was visiting with them. And at one time, up to as many as five hundred people who were gathered at one place, He appeared. It's difficult to just cast aside or deny the witness of these people. To do so is to discredit our whole jurisprudence system. But not only that, these men who testified that they saw the risen Lord, that they talked to Him, that they ate with Him, they, all of them, with the exception of one, met violent deaths at the hands of other people because of their affirming that the story they told was true. You talk about witnesses sworn to tell the truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth. If a person's life was threatened because of that witness, and it was a lie, at least one them would've broken under the pressure. They would've confessed to the entire hoax. "He showed Himself alive after His passion by many infallible proofs."<br/>being seen of them for forty days, speaking to them of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God ( Act 1:3 ):<br/>Sometimes we fault the disciples because of their questions of the timing of the kingdom of God. Let it be remembered that the kingdom of God was the favorite subject of Jesus Christ. He was always talking about the kingdom of God, and it is a great hope that He was planting into the hearts of all men. Things are not always going to continue corrupted as they are. The world is not going to go forever under the power of darkness, under the bondage of evil. God is going to one day establish His kingdom upon the earth. A kingdom of righteous joy and peace. "Jesus shall reign, where ere the sun doth her successive journeys run. And His kingdom will extend from shore to shore." And that day will be the most glorious day the world has ever seen, as sickness and suffering and pain will be abolished in His kingdom. As sin and greed and these things that have made the world such an intolerable place will be abolished in His kingdom. The godless commercialism, the exploitation of man, all of these things abolished in His glorious kingdom when He reigns. No wonder the disciples were anxious to get it on. I'm anxious to get it on; I'm anxious for His kingdom to come. And Jesus told us when we pray, the first petition is, "Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven" ( Mat 6:10 ). This is the right kind of a desire that we should all have. I desire the kingdom of God. And so He was talking to them, during this forty-day period, of the kingdom.<br/>And, being assembled together with them, he commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which, saith he, you have heard of me ( Act 1:4 ).<br/>He said, "Now look, wait here in Jerusalem until you receive the promise of the Father." This promise that He is referring to is, no doubt, the promise in Joel where the Lord promised, "And it shall come to pass in the later days, saith the Lord, that I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and daughters will prophesy, and your young men shall dream dreams, your old men shall see visions: and upon my servants and my handmaidens shall I pour out my Spirit, saith the Lord" ( Joe 2:28-29 ). The promise of the Father: the day is going to come when God is going to pour out His Spirit upon all flesh, all of the believers. They will, each one, receive that dynamic from God.<br/>For John [He said,] truly baptized with water; but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now ( Act 1:5 ).<br/>The idea of baptism was that of emersion, the bapteedzo. John baptized with water, submerged the people in water, "you're going to be submerged in the Holy Spirit in not many days."<br/>Now when they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, will you at this time restore the kingdom to Israel? ( Act 1:6 )<br/>"When is it going to be, Lord? When's the time for this restoration?" And Jesus is talking to them now, not about the kingdom, but about the power that they're going to receive for service. And so He brushes aside their question.<br/>Saying unto them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father has put in his own power ( Act 1:7 ).<br/>"It's not for you to know." They lived constantly in the anticipation of the immediate setting up of the kingdom. During the entire lifetime of Jesus, they were expecting Him at any moment to go into the phone booth and come out as the savior of the world. Shazzam! Showing His power and overthrowing the governments of the world, establishing God's kingdom upon the earth. And they were waiting daily for this change to transpire. And whenever Jesus would talk about going to Jerusalem, being turned over into the hands of sinful man, and then being crucified, "Oh, oh no, Lord. No, no you don't understand the kingdom, Lord. Be that far from Thee." When Jesus died on the cross, they were all greatly disappointed.<br/>The two disciples on the road to Emmaus, so sad. "Hey, fellows. How come you're so sad as your walking along?" "What do you mean? You must be a stranger around here if you don't know the things that have been happening lately in Jerusalem." "What things?" "Oh, a fellow by the name of Jesus of Nazareth...oh man, it was mighty and powerful. The anointing of God was upon His life. We had hoped that in Him was the deliverance of Israel, but they crucified Him. We had hoped . . . now it's dead." Now He's risen, and He's saying, "In a few days, fellows, you're going to receive the promise of the Father." "Oh, what promise? The promise of the establishing of the kingdom?" You see, it was legitimate that they should ask. "Is this it Lord? Alright! Is this the time? Are you going to set up your kingdom now?" "No. It's not for you to know those times that the Father's appointed or that the Father has in His own power. But, you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you."<br/>Now here, the Greek preposition epi is used to signify a new relationship that they were to have with the Holy Spirit. In the Gospel According to John, chapter 14, as Jesus is there promising to send the Holy Spirit, He said, "I will not leave you comfortless. I will come to you, and I will pray the Father, and He will send to you another comforter, even the Spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth Him not neither knows Him, but you know Him for He dwells with you, and He shall be in you" ( Joh 14:17-18 ). Same Greek preposition as ours, only they spell it "en" instead of "in." Two-fold relationship there in John: He is with you, but He's going to be dwelling in you. But now Jesus said you're going to receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you. The Greek preposition epi, which is translated in different texts throughout the New Testament as "upon" or "over" or I like it, "overflows."<br/>In the seventh chapter of the gospel of John: "On the last day, the great day of the feast when Jesus stood there on the Temple Mount and cried to the people, 'If any man thirst let him come unto Me and drink: and he who drinks of the water that I give, out of his innermost being there will gush torrents of living water.'" John said, "This spake He of the Spirit, which was not yet given which they who believe on Him should receive" ( Joh 7:37-39 ). What did He speak of the Spirit? That it would be like a torrent of living water flowing out. I like, "When the Spirit overflows you," upon you, or over you, or overflows from you. So the three-fold relationship: He is with you prior to your conversion, He is the one who causes you to realize that you are a sinner, He is the one who points to Jesus Christ as the answer as He convinces the world of sin, of righteous, and of judgment. The moment you open your life and heart to Jesus Christ and invite Him to come in, the Holy Spirit comes and begins to indwell you. He shall be in you. "Know ye not that you are not your own, you have been bought with a price, therefore glorify God in your body and your spirit which are His. And know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit which is in you? Be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess, but be filled, or be ye being filled with the Spirit" ( 1Co 6:19-20 ,Eph 5:18 ). But now here's a third relationship. This is an empowering experience.<br/>You will receive [the dunamus] the dynamics, when the Holy Spirit has come [epi] upon you [or over you, or when there is that overflow from you]: and ye shall be witnesses unto me ( Act 1:8 )<br/>And so the dynamic, to be a witness for Jesus Christ. It is interesting that the word witness in Greek is the word martus from where we get our word martyr. And in Greek it does mean martyr. A witness is one who not only proclaims what he believes, he lives what he believes, he is what he believes, and he believes it so strongly, that if necessary, he'll die for what he believes. That's how strong is his belief. He's a martus. You can't stop him. He's not afraid to die for what he believes.<br/>You remember when Paul was on his way back to Jerusalem and Agabus came down from Caesarea and he took Paul's girdle and tied himself up and he said, "So is the man who owns this girdle to be bound when he gets to Jerusalem." And Paul's friends began to weep, saying, "Oh, Paul, don't go, don't go." And he said, "What do you mean by these tears? Do you think you're going to dissuade me? Do you think I'm worried about being bound? I'm ready to die." He was a martus. "I'm ready to die." Being put to death for your faith did not make you a martyr; because you were a martyr, you were put to death. Because you were a witness, because you believed it so strong. So, it did not make you a witness, it only proved what you were. You were a witness all along. If you hadn't been a martus, you would've never gone to your death. You would've recanted; you would've said, "Whoa, whoa, wait, wait. Hold on, let's change course here. I think that I may have made a mistake." Then you say, "Well, he wasn't a martus. Stealing a horse doesn't make you a horse thief; it only proves that you were. No one steals a horse unless he's a horse thief. So, stealing it doesn't make you a horse thief, it only proves that you were all along. Being martyred only proves what you were a witness, a martus. "And you will be witnesses." And isn't it interesting that most of them were martyred? "Witnesses unto Me."<br/>The witness was to be both in Jerusalem, and in all of Judea ( Act 1:8 ),<br/>The witness began right at home. The hardest place, isn't it? It's to start right at home in Jerusalem, and then the area around Jerusalem, the area of Judea. And then it was to spread up into Samaria. And then it was to go out into the uttermost parts of the world. And as we study the book of Acts, we will see this very progression. How the witness began in Jerusalem. We'll get that in the next chapter. And then we'll see how it began to spread through out Judea. And then Phillip went up into Samaria, and then finally Paul and Barnabas are called to go into the uttermost parts of the world. And so the witness spread through the anointing and the empowering of the Holy Spirit.<br/>Now when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight ( Act 1:9 ).<br/>This is the final promise made by Jesus to His disciples. This is it, the final words prior to His ascension. Of course, later He came and talked to Paul and others, but prior to His ascension, this is His final word. And upon this, when He had spoken these things, while they were watching Him, He was taken up and a cloud received Him out of their sight.<br/>And while they were looking steadfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, there were two men who stood by them in white apparel ( Act 1:10 );<br/>We assume they were angels.<br/>Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as you have seen him go into heaven ( Act 1:11 ).<br/>They saw Him as He ascended up into heaven and they will behold Him when He comes again. "Behold the Lord cometh with ten thousands of His saints, to execute judgement upon the earth" (Jud 1:14-15). And then, "Unto Him who loved us and gave Himself for us and who has made us unto our God, kings and priests who shall reign with Him upon the earth, behold the Lord cometh, and every eye shall see Him, and they also who pierced Him shall mourn" Rev 1:5-7 ). So the Lord's coming. Every eye shall see Him. The Jehovah Witnesses say that He is already come, but it was a secret coming. As it was only the disciples that saw Him go, it was only the disciples, of the Jehovah Witnesses, who saw Him return. But Jesus said, "If they say unto you, 'He has come in secret and has gone into a secret chamber don't believe it'" ( Mat 24:26 ). So you have to choose, to believe Jesus or them.<br/>"This same Jesus which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as you've seen Him go into heaven."<br/>Now there's a very interesting verse in II John, verse Act 1:7 , "For many deceivers are entered into the world who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh." That, unfortunately, is a poor translation of the Greek. For this participle is in the present tense and should be translated "is coming in the flesh." Those who would deny that Jesus Christ is coming in the flesh. What does John say of them? "They are a deceiver and an antichrist. Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward. For whosoever transgresses and abides not in the doctrine of Christ, has not God. He that abides in the doctrine of Christ, he has both the Father and the Son. And if there come any unto your door (on Saturday morning) and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, and neither bid him good-bye. For he that bids him good-bye is a partaker of his evil deeds" (2Jn 1:7-11). Ask them one question, "Is Jesus coming in the flesh?" Just ask them that question. And if they say no, just remember what John warned you and what John told you. "If any confess not that Jesus Christ is coming in the flesh." Do you remember when He was with the disciples and He said, "Give me something to eat"? He said, "You know, spirits don't eat; touch me. See? It's me." So, this same Jesus is coming again in the same manner in which they saw Him go into heaven. And I, for one, believe that that coming is very soon.<br/>Then retuned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a Sabbath's day journey [about two-thirds of a mile]. And when they were come in, they went up into an upper room, where there abode both Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, and Phillip, and Thomas, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon Zelotes, and Judas the brother of James. And these all continued in one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers ( Act 1:12-14 ).<br/>This is the last mention of Mary the mother of Jesus. At this point and from this point on, there is no further mention of her in the Acts of the Apostles or in the epistles. No mention of her death or of her miraculous ascension into heaven, without death. Nothing is mentioned in the scripture. It is silent.<br/>His brethren would be a reference probably to James and to Jude and to those other brothers who were sons of Joseph and Mary.<br/>The upper room--there are some who say that it is the same upper room in which Jesus had the Last Supper with His disciples. And yet, there are others who hold to this upper room being a room in the temple precincts where the early church met. Take your choice.<br/>And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples, and said, (the number of their names together were about one hundred and twenty,) men and brethren, this Scripture must needs have been fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit by the mouth of David spake before concerning Judas, which was a guide to those who took Jesus ( Act 1:15-16 ).<br/>Here again, Peter still his same impetuous self. They're waiting in prayer and supplication, and Peter stands up and says, "Fellows, there's a scripture that's gotta be fulfilled." And you know he's going to move ahead, "Let's get the program going; let's cast lots and find out who's going to take Judas' place." I do feel that Peter was again in the flesh, manifesting that impetuous nature that was his. And I think that the future history of the church in the book of Acts points this out. I am interested in Peter's understanding of the scriptures, how that he is quoting from so many places in the Old Testament. Peter does manifest a very great understanding of the Old Testament scriptures which is a point in his favor.<br/>Notice that Peter ascribes to the Holy Spirit those things that David wrote. So that, "All scripture is given by inspiration of God" ( 2Ti 3:16 ). Not part of the scriptures. Because, if you tell me that part of the scriptures are given by inspiration of God, then I must ask you, "What parts are by inspiration and what parts are not by inspiration?" And then you are then the authority who tells me what part I can believe and what part I can't believe. And the minute that God is no longer the authority but you're the authority, I'm in trouble. Beware of those who say, "Well, you can't believe all of the scriptures." The scriptures themselves say, "All scripture is given by inspiration of God." And here, Luke in writing of what Peter was saying, declares that David was actually the spokesman for the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit, by the mouth of David, spake concerning Judas.<br/>For he was numbered with us, [he was one of the twelve] he had obtained a part of this ministry. But now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity; and falling headlong ( Act 1:17-18 ),<br/>He purchased the field, the potter's field as Zachariah the eleventh chapter declares.<br/>and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all of his bowels gushed out ( Act 1:18 ).<br/>There are those who find a discrepancy in the scriptures, because in one of the gospels we are told that when Judas came back and tried to return the money, and they said, "Hey, it's your problem. We can't take it." And put it back in the temple treasury. "It's blood money." Then he threw it there on the floor of the temple and he went out and hung himself. Here Peter tells us that he fell headlong and just popped. And there are those who imagine a discrepancy. Very simple, he went up into the tree to hang himself, tied the rope around his neck and tied it to the limb and jumped. And the force of the fall either snapped the rope or his head, and he fell on down into the canyon and just as he said it here.<br/>It was known to all of the dwellers at Jerusalem; insomuch that the field is called in their tongue, Aceldama, that is to say, The field of blood. For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be desolate, and let no man dwell therein: and, His bishoprick let another take ( Act 1:19-20 ).<br/>Now in reality he's quoting from two different Psalms here. From Psa 69:25 ,he puts it together with Psa 109:8 . And putting the two together he finds these prophecies concerning Judas.<br/>Wherefore of these men ( Act 1:21 )<br/>Now here is where they are looking for someone to take Judas' place to be an apostle. Here are the qualifications they looked for in that time.<br/>Wherefore of these men which have companied with us all the time that the Lord Jesus when in and out among us ( Act 1:21 ),<br/>Now you remember there were many disciples, many disciples of which Jesus chose ten to be apostles. And the word apostle means "one who is sent out." Or chose twelve to be apostles, so He sent out the twelve. The number of human government. "We only have eleven. We need one to take Judas' place, but we need one who has been with us all the while from the beginning with Jesus."<br/>From the time he was baptized by John, until the day he was taken up from us, must one be ordained to be a witness [of what?] of His resurrection ( Act 1:22 ).<br/>So these were the requirements they were looking for. Someone who had been around the whole while. From the time of John's baptism to the ascension. And one who saw the risen Lord, and thus could bear fact of the resurrection, their testimony to the fact.<br/>Now Paul the apostle, later in asserting the fact that he was an apostle said, "Have I not seen the risen Christ?" Evidently that was one of the requirements of apostleship. Someone asked me, "Are there apostles today?" Well, I don't know. I don't think that there are in the same sense that they were in the New Testament. Surely there is none today who can bear witness to the resurrection as they did.<br/>They appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias. And they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord, which knowest the hearts of all men, show whether of these two that you have chosen ( Act 1:23-24 ),<br/>I think that we often make this mistake of giving the Lord two choices, both wrong. Limiting God, you see. We're so prone to do this. Obviously, Paul was God's choice. Peter was impetuous, and jumping the gun said, "Hey, we've got to do something, you know, gotta help God out. You know, one's missing and we've got to fill him in." And yet, "God, which one of these two do you want?" And giving God the two choices.<br/>That he may take part of this ministry and this apostleship, from which Judas by the transgression fell, that he might go to his own place. And so they gave forth their lots ( Act 1:25-26 );<br/>An interesting way by which they sought to determine the will of God. Let's throw dice, find out what God's will is here. It's interesting to me, the various ways that people have devised to discern the will of God. Now, in the Old Testament times they had an interesting way of coming to the priest, who would inquire of the Lord for them through the Urim and the Thummim, the "lights and perfections." Just what these Urim and Thummim were, we don't know. I'm sure they were not the colored glasses that Joseph Smith found with the Golden Tablets; the magic glasses, that when you put them on, you could suddenly read the hieroglyphic writing.<br/>There are those who say that the Urim and Thummim were actually a black and a white stone that was worn in a pouch on the chest of the priest. They would pray and ask the Lord a particular question. You remember that David was asking the Lord definite questions: "Lord, shall we go out against the Philistines?" The answer was, "No." So again, the next day, "Lord, shall we go out against the Philistines?" The answer was, "Yes." "When shall we go?" They would ask specific questions, and the Lord would direct them through the Urim and the Thummin. They say that the priest would pray, seek God, and then reach in and pull out one of the two stones. If it was the white stone, it was a yes answer. If it was a no, then it would be the black stone that he would pull out. Some even say we get the term blackballed from this Urim and Thummim. Actually, back in the original it is a no vote against a particular project or idea. Just what the Urim and Thummim were, we don't know. But during the Old Testament period, they did use a method of casting lots to determine the will of God.<br/>So here the disciples are picking up on the same thing as they are throwing the dice to see which of the two fellows that God had chosen to replace Judas Iscariot.<br/>the lot fell on Matthias; he was numbered with the eleven ( Act 1:26 ).<br/>Now who in the world is Matthias? No one ever heard of him before or since. It'll be interesting to meet Matthias and find out who he is and what he did. I think from the subsequent history, it's obvious to assume that God chose Paul as an apostle. Paul declares it himself. Now this is the last time we ever read of them seeking to discern the will of God by the casting of lots or by a chance kind of a thing.<br/>I know a fellow today, in seeking to discern the will of the Lord, will pray and ask the Lord a question. He'll have ten pennies in his pocket, and as he's praying, he'll take the pennies with his eyes closed and put them down on the table, and if they all come up heads, it's a yes. An interesting thing, every once in a while, they'll all come up heads, and that's pretty good odds. Yet, we don't find any pattern for this after the Holy Spirit was given. Once the Holy Spirit came upon the church, then the Holy Spirit began to speak to them and direct them. And the Holy Spirit said, "Separate unto me Paul and Barnabas for the ministry where I have called them" ( Act 13:2 ). And the Holy Spirit sent them forth. So we find the church more directly guided by the Holy Spirit. Once the Holy Spirit came, this throwing dice to find out the will of God was set aside.<br/>"<br/><br/>King James Version<br/><br/>This is the 1769 King James Version of the Holy Bible (also known as the Authorized Version). "Public Domain" | Smith Chuck - Gennem Bibelen C2000 SeriesSkal vi vende os til Apostlenes Gerninger, kapitel et, når vi begynder vores studium af den tidlige kirke.<br/>Lukas, forfatteren af Apostlenes Gerninger, en følgesvend af Paulus apostelen, som også var forfatter til Evangeliet Ifølge Lukas, skrev disse to afhandlinger til en ven, Theophilus. Theophilus er et græsk navn. Det er et navn, der har en smuk betydning. Navnet betyder elsker af Gud. Der er nogle, der tror, at det ikke var et menneske overhovedet, men at evangeliet og Apostlenes Gerninger var rettet til de elskere af Gud, uanset hvem du måtte være. Der er andre traditioner, der siger, at Theophilus faktisk var Lukas' herre, og at læger på den tid var slaver, som regel slaver af en velhavende beskytter. Lukas' herre var altså Teofilus, og han løslod Lukas for at være sammen med Paulus på missionsrejserne. Lukas skriver således tilbage til sin tidligere herre. Dette er en tidlig tradition i kirken, men det er selvfølgelig umuligt at bevise, som så mange af de traditioner.<br/>Der er også dem, der tror, at da Paulus var i Troas, og han fik et syn af en mand, der kaldte på ham og sagde: "Kom over til Makedonien og hjælp os," at den mand i Paulus' syn var ingen anden end Lukas. For den første, som Paulus virkelig mødte, da han kom til Makedonien, var Lukas. Og som vi er i Apostlenes Gerninger, vil du finde, at når vi kommer til den del af Apostlenes Gerninger, Lukas begynder at skrive mere i den første person snarere end den tredje person. Så det er åbenbart på dette særlige tidspunkt i Apostlenes Gerninger, at Luke blev en følgesvend af Paulus og begyndte at rejse med ham. Han begyndte at bruge pronomenerne "vi" og "os" i stedet for "de" og "dem". Dette er uden tvivl, hvor Luke blev en deltager og et øjenvidne til de ting, der skete fra dette punkt. Vi vil bringe dette ud til dig, når vi kommer til det punkt.<br/>Han begynder Apostlenes Gerninger ved at binde det med Evangeliet Ifølge Lukas. Det er interessant, at det allersidste, som Lukas registrerer i sit evangelium, er det allerførste, han registrerer i Apostlenes Gerninger. Vi finder Lukasevangeliet slutter, da Jesus fortæller sine disciple at vente i Jerusalem, indtil de bliver udstyret med kraft fra det høje. Og så steg Jesus op til himlen, og så lukker han evangeliet. I åbningen af Apostlenes Gerninger skriver han:<br/>Den første afhandling har jeg skrevet til dig, Teofilus, om alt det, som Jesus begyndte både at gøre og at lære.<br/>Nøgleordet er begyndt. Evangeliet Ifølge Lukas er ikke den fulde historie om Jesu Kristi tjeneste. Det er kun begyndelsen af Jesu Kristi tjeneste. Jesus fortsætter med at tjene til folks behov. Jesus fortsætter med at helbrede de syge. Jesus fortsætter med at oprejse de døde. Jesus fortsætter med at forkynde sin kærlighed og sit evangelium for verden, men nu tjener han gennem de disciple, der er blevet salvet med hans Helligånd. Men Kristi tjeneste fortsætter; dybest set er den forudsætning, at Lukas tager i Apostlenes Gerninger. Den tidligere afhandling af alt, hvad Jesus begyndte, både at gøre og at undervise.<br/>På grund af dette er Apostlenes Gerninger en ufærdig bog: i og med at Herren i dag fortsætter med at arbejde gennem livet for dem, der har indviet sig til at være Guds redskaber. At blive ledet og vejledt og salvet af Hans Hellige Ånd, for at fortsætte Jesu tjeneste i verden i dag. Nu har Gud ordineret, at hans arbejde skal udføres gennem menneskelige instrumenter. Jeg siger ikke, at det skal udføres. Gud kan bruge engle til sit arbejde, og der vil komme en tid i Åbenbaringens Bog, hvor Gud vil bruge engle til at forkynde sit evangelium for mennesker over hele verden. Åbenbaringen, kapitel 14, "Den første engel, der flyver midt gennem himlen, har det evige evangelium" (Åb 14:6). Men på nuværende tidspunkt har Gud valgt at bruge menneskelige instrumenter. Så ufuldkomne som de måtte være, men det er det, Gud har ordineret til at bruge. Det spændende ved det er, at Gud vil bruge mig og Gud vil bruge dig. Så mange gange tigger vi, "Herre, jeg kan ikke tale. Jeg har aldrig været i stand til at tale før eller nu, Herre." Som Moses forsøgte at tigge Guds kald. Jeremias sagde, "Herre, jeg er bare et barn; ingen vil lytte til mig." Og vi har alle vores undskyldninger for, hvorfor vi ikke kan bruges. Gør vi ikke? Vi kender alle årsagerne til, at Gud ikke kunne bruge os.<br/>Engang, da Herren kaldte en profet til at gøre sit arbejde, sagde han: "Herre, send hvem du vil." Herren sagde: "Hey, jeg har kaldt dig." "Herre, god idé; send hvem du vil." Så ofte er vi i den position, "Herre, send med hvem du vil, enhver anden end mig Herre." Og alligevel har Gud bestemt til at bruge os.<br/>Hver af os kan vise vores egne ufuldkommenheder. Hver af os kan pege på vores egne manglende evner, og vi kan alle finde en undskyldning for, hvorfor Gud ikke ønsker at bruge mig. Men alligevel har Gud valgt at bruge dig. Du spekulerer på, hvornår Gud har sådanne instrumenter til at bruge, hvordan han fik arbejdet gjort, ikke?<br/>Indtil den dag, hvor han blev optaget, efter at han ved Helligånden havde givet befalinger til apostlene, som han havde valgt (ApG 1:2):<br/>Det var det, han afsluttede Lukasevangeliet med den dag, da Jesus blev taget op, efter at han havde sagt til apostlene, at de skulle vente på magtens gave.<br/>For hvem han også viste sig levende for dem efter sin lidelse [eller død] ved mange ufejlbarlige beviser (ApG 1:3),<br/>Det er svært at benægte det faktum, Jesu Kristi opstandelse. Jeg var underholdt, såvel som irriteret og irriteret, af en artikel, jeg læste i Santa Ana Register denne sidste lørdag. Om skabelsesvidenskaben og evolutionsteorierne, der bliver præsenteret i amtsskolerne. Hvordan det, denne ene professor sagde, at han underviser i en videnskabsklasse, og dermed handler de kun om fakta, og at de ikke har plads til teorier. Fordi videnskaben er baseret på fakta, og skabelsen er baseret på religiøs overtro. Det kræver en masse tro at tro på de religiøse teorier. Når du har at gøre med fakta, kan du bare acceptere dem. Jeg tænkte, "Meget interessant i den videnskabsklasse, de lærte mig, at det var et faktum, at verden var fire milliarder år gammel. Nu i dag lærer de, at det er et faktum, at verden er tolv milliarder år gammel. Det er ikke så længe siden, at jeg gik i skole.”<br/>Det er interessant, at Bibelen aldrig har behøvet at blive revideret eller opdateret for at imødekomme de nuværende data, som mænd har opdaget. Og alligevel, hvis du ville tage mine high school science lærebøger i dag og forsøge at undervise en videnskabsklasse fra dem, ville du opdage, at mange af de ting, der blev undervist som videnskabelig kendsgerning, da jeg var i gymnasiet, ikke længere anerkendes som videnskabelig kendsgerning. Den simple celleprotoplasma er ikke længere en simpel celle, men ekstremt kompleks. Hvis der er noget faktum, der kan attesteres i historien, er det det faktum, at Jesu Kristi opstandelse fra de døde.<br/>Vi har en retspraksis, der er baseret på vidneudsagn. Hvis en mand er anklaget for en forbrydelse, og der er mennesker, der var vidne til denne forbrydelse, mens den blev begået, og de er bragt til standarden, og de sværger at fortælle sandheden, hele sandheden, og intet andet end sandheden, så hjælp dem Gud. Og i deres afhøring bekræfter de, at "Jeg så den mand i banken den 23. maj. Jeg så ham trække en pistol ud af sin frakke. Jeg hørte ham kræve, at alle pengene blev givet til ham. Jeg så ham, da han forlod banken. Jeg så ham, som betjenten pågreb ham udenfor." Og hvis du kan få tre eller fire vidner til at pege på den mand og vil holde deres vidnesbyrd under krydsforhør, at manden er dømt for at være skyldig. Han er den, der gjorde det. Vi har to eller tre vidner, der vidner om den mand, og det er accepteret, at det er ham, der begik forbrydelsen og er skyldig.<br/>Efter Jesu død, da han stod op igen, viste han sig for mange forskellige mennesker, der svor vidne om, at de så ham. At de talte til ham, at han viste sig for dem på forskellige steder under forskellige omstændigheder. Og for en periode på fyrre dage var på besøg hos dem. Og på én gang, op til så mange som fem hundrede mennesker, der var samlet på ét sted, Han viste sig. Det er svært at bare kaste til side eller benægte vidne af disse mennesker. At gøre det er at miskreditere hele vores retspraksis. Men ikke nok med det, disse mænd, der vidnede om, at de så den opstandne Herre, at de talte til ham, at de spiste sammen med ham, de, alle sammen, med undtagelse af én, blev voldsomt dræbt af andre mennesker, fordi de bekræftede, at den historie, de fortalte, var sand. Du taler om vidner, der har svoret at fortælle sandheden, hele sandheden, intet andet end sandheden. "Han viste sig i live efter sin lidenskab ved mange ufejlbarlige beviser."<br/>De blev set af dem i fyrre dage og talte til dem om det, der hører Guds rige til (ApG 1,3).<br/>Nogle gange giver vi disciplene skylden på grund af deres spørgsmål om tidspunktet for Guds rige. Lad os huske at Guds rige var Jesu Kristi foretrukne emne. Han talte altid om Guds rige, og det er et stort håb, at han plantede i alle menneskers hjerter. Tingene vil ikke altid fortsætte fordærvet, som de er. Verden vil ikke gå for evigt under mørkets magt, under ondskabens trældom. Gud vil en dag etablere sit rige på jorden. Et rige med retfærdig glæde og fred. "Jesus skal regere, hvor før solen går sine efterfølgende rejser. Og hans rige vil strække sig fra land til land." Og den dag vil være den mest herlige dag verden nogensinde har set, da sygdom og lidelse og smerte vil blive afskaffet i hans rige. Som synd og grådighed og disse ting, der har gjort verden til et så utåleligt sted, vil blive afskaffet i hans rige. Den gudløse kommercialisme, udnyttelsen af mennesket, alle disse ting afskaffet i hans herlige rige, da han regerer. Ikke underligt, at disciplene var ivrige efter at få det på. Jeg er ivrig efter at få det på; Jeg er ivrig efter hans rige kommer. Og Jesus fortalte os, når vi beder, er den første bøn: "Komme dit rige. Ske din vilje på jorden, som det er i himlen" (Mat 6:10). Dette er den rigtige form for et ønske, som vi alle bør have. Jeg ønsker Guds rige. Og han talte til dem i denne fyrre dages periode om riget.<br/>Og da han var forsamlet med dem, befalede han dem, at de ikke skulle forlade Jerusalem, men vente på Faderens løfte, som I, siger han, har hørt om mig (ApG 1:4).<br/>Han sagde: "Se, her i Jerusalem skal I blive, indtil I får Faderens forjættelse." Dette løfte, som han henviser til, er uden tvivl løftet i Joel, hvor Herren lovede: "Og det skal ske i de senere dage, siger Herren, at jeg vil udgyde min Ånd over alt kød; og jeres sønner og døtre skal profetere, og jeres unge mænd skal drømme drømme, jeres gamle mænd skal se syner; og over mine tjenere og mine tjenestepiger skal jeg udgyde min Ånd, siger Herren. " Faderens løfte: Den dag vil komme, da Gud vil udgyde sin Ånd over alt kød, alle de troende. De vil hver især modtage denne dynamik fra Gud.<br/>For Johannes døbte i sandhed med vand; men I skal døbes med Helligånden om ikke mange dage (ApG 1:5).<br/>Ideen om dåb var, at emersion, bapteedzo. John døbte med vand, nedsænket folket i vand, "du kommer til at blive nedsænket i Helligånden i ikke mange dage."<br/>Men da de kom sammen, spurgte de ham og sagde: "Herre! vil du nu give Israel Riget tilbage?"<br/>"Hvornår skal det ske, Herre? Hvornår er det tid til denne genoprettelse?" Og Jesus taler til dem nu, ikke om riget, men om den magt, som de skal modtage til tjeneste. Og så børster han deres spørgsmål til side.<br/>Og han sagde til dem: Det tilkommer ikke jer at kende de tider eller tider, som Faderen har sat i sin egen magt (ApG 1,7).<br/>"Det er ikke for dig at vide." De levede konstant i forventning om den umiddelbare oprettelse af riget. I hele Jesu levetid forventede de ham på ethvert tidspunkt at gå ind i telefonboksen og komme ud som verdens frelser. Shazzam! Viser sin magt og omstyrter verdens regeringer, etablerer Guds rige på jorden. Og de ventede dagligt på, at denne forandring skulle ske. Og når Jesus talte om at gå til Jerusalem, blive overgivet i syndige menneskers hænder, og derefter blive korsfæstet, "Åh nej, Herre. Nej, nej, du forstår ikke riget, Herre. Vær så langt fra dig." Da Jesus døde på korset, blev de alle meget skuffede.<br/>De to Disciple paa Vejen til Emmaus, saa bedrøvede. "Hej, Kammerater! hvorfor er I saa bedrøvede, som da I vandrede med?" "Hvad mener De? Du maa være en Fremmed her omkring, hvis I ikke veed, hvad der er hændt sidst i Jerusalem." "hvad?" "Åh, en fyr ved navn Jesus af Nazareth ... åh menneske, det var mægtigt og kraftfuldt. Guds salvelse var over hans liv. Vi havde håbet, at i ham var udfrielsen af Israel, men de korsfæstede ham. Vi havde håbet . . . nu er det død. " Nu er Han opstået, og Han siger, "Om et par dage, gutter, vil I modtage Faderens løfte." "Åh, hvilket løfte? Løftet om oprettelsen af riget?" Du ser, det var legitimt, at de skulle spørge. "Er det Herre? Okay! Er det tid? Vil du oprette dit rige nu? "Nej. Det er ikke for dig at vide de tider, som Faderen har udpeget, eller som Faderen har i sin egen kraft. Men du vil modtage kraft, når Helligånden er kommet over dig. "<br/>Her bruges den græske præposition epi til at betegne et nyt forhold, som de skulle have til Helligånden. Ifølge Johannesevangeliet, kapitel 14, er Jesus der og lover at sende Helligånden, og han sagde: "Jeg vil ikke efterlade jer trøstesløse. Jeg vil komme til jer, og jeg vil bede Faderen, og han vil sende jer en anden trøster, nemlig Sandhedens Ånd, som verden ikke kan modtage, fordi den hverken ser ham eller kender ham, men I kender ham, for han bliver hos jer, og han skal være i jer” (Joh 14:17-18). Samme græske præposition som vores, kun de staver det "en" i stedet for "i". To-fold forhold der i Johannes: Han er med dig, men han kommer til at bo i dig. Men nu sagde Jesus, at du kommer til at modtage kraft, når Helligånden kommer over dig. Den græske præposition epi, som er oversat i forskellige tekster i hele Det Nye Testamente som "på" eller "over", eller jeg kan lide det, "overløb."<br/>I det syvende kapitel af Johannesevangeliet: "På den sidste dag, den store festdag, da Jesus stod der på Tempelbjerget og råbte til folket: 'Hvis nogen tørster, lad ham komme til mig og drikke; og den, der drikker af det vand, jeg giver, fra hans inderste væsen vil der strømme strømmer af levende vand.'" Johannes sagde: "Dette sagde han om Ånden, som endnu ikke var givet, hvad de, der tror på ham, skulle få" (Joh 7:37-39). Hvad talte han om Ånden? At det ville være som en strøm af levende vand, der strømmer ud. Jeg kan lide, "Når Ånden oversvømmer dig," over dig, eller over dig, eller oversvømmer fra dig. Så det trefoldige forhold: Han er med dig før din omvendelse, han er den, der får dig til at indse, at du er en synder, han er den, der peger på Jesus Kristus som svaret, da han overbeviser verden om synd, om retfærdig og om dom. I det øjeblik du åbner dit liv og hjerte for Jesus Kristus og inviterer Ham til at komme ind, kommer Helligånden og begynder at bo i dig. Han skal være i dig. "Ved I ikke, at I ikke ere eders egne, at I ere blevne købte for en Pris, derfor prise Gud i eders Legeme og eders Ånd, som ere hans; og vide I ikke, at eders Legeme er Helligåndens Tempel, som er i eder? Vær ikke beruset af vin, hvor der er overskydende, men blive fyldt, eller blive fyldt med Ånden" (1 Kor 6:19-20, Ef 5:18). Men nu er her et tredje forhold. Dette er en bemyndigende oplevelse.<br/>I skal få dynamikken, når Helligånden kommer over jer, og I skal være vidner for mig.<br/>Og så dynamikken, at være vidne til Jesus Kristus. Det er interessant, at ordet vidne på græsk er ordet martus hvorfra vi får vores ord martyr. Og på græsk betyder det martyr. Et vidne er en, der ikke kun proklamerer, hvad han tror, han lever, hvad han tror, han er, hvad han tror, og han tror det så stærkt, at hvis det er nødvendigt, vil han dø for, hvad han tror. Det er, hvor stærk er hans tro. Han er en martus. Han er ikke bange for at dø for det, han tror på.<br/>Du husker, da Paulus var på vej tilbage til Jerusalem, og Agabus kom ned fra Cæsarea, og han tog Paulus' bælte og bandt sig og sagde: "Sådan skal den mand, der ejer dette bælte, bindes, når han kommer til Jerusalem." Og Pauls venner begyndte at græde og sagde: "Åh, Paul, gå ikke, gå ikke." Og han sagde: "Hvad mener du med disse tårer? Tror du, at du vil afskrække mig? Tror du, at jeg er bekymret for at blive bundet? Jeg er klar til at dø." Han var en martus. "Jeg er klar til at dø." At blive henrettet for din tro gjorde dig ikke til en martyr; fordi du var en martyr, blev du dræbt. Fordi du var et vidne, fordi du troede det så stærkt. Så det gjorde dig ikke til et vidne, det beviste kun, hvad du var. Du var et vidne hele tiden. Hvis du ikke havde været en martus, ville du aldrig have gået i døden. Du ville have tilbagekaldt; du ville have sagt, "Whoa, whoa, vent, vent. Hold ud, lad os ændre kurs her. Jeg tror, at jeg måske har lavet en fejl." Så siger du, "Nå, han var ikke en martus. At stjæle en hest gør dig ikke til en hestetyv; det beviser kun, at du var. Ingen stjæler en hest, medmindre han er en hestetyv. Så at stjæle det gør dig ikke til en hestetyv, det beviser kun, at du var det hele tiden. At blive martyr beviser kun det, du var vidne til, en martus. "Og I vil være vidner." Og er det ikke interessant, at de fleste af dem blev martyrer? "Vitner til mig."<br/>Vidnet skulle være både i Jerusalem og i hele Judæa (ApG 1:8).<br/>Vidnet begyndte hjemme. Det sværeste sted, ikke? Det er at starte hjemme i Jerusalem, og derefter området omkring Jerusalem, området Judæa. Og så var det at sprede sig til Samaria. Og så var det at gå ud i de yderste dele af verden. Og når vi studerer Apostlenes Gerninger, vil vi se denne meget fremskridt. Hvordan vidnet begyndte i Jerusalem. Vi får det i det næste kapitel. Og så vil vi se, hvordan det begyndte at sprede sig gennem Judæa. Og så Phillip gik op til Samaria, og så endelig Paulus og Barnabas er kaldet til at gå ind i de yderste dele af verden. Og så vidnet spredt gennem salvelse og bemyndigelse af Helligånden.<br/>Og da han havde sagt dette, blev han løftet op, medens de så det; og en Sky tog ham bort fra deres Øjne (ApG 1,9).<br/>Dette er det sidste løfte Jesus gav sine disciple. Dette er det, de sidste ord før hans opstigning. Selvfølgelig kom han senere og talte med Paulus og andre, men før hans opstigning er dette hans sidste ord. Og da han havde sagt dette, blev han løftet op, medens de så ham, og en Sky tog ham bort fra deres Øjne.<br/>Og medens de stirrede op mod himlen, da han steg op, se, da stod to mænd hos dem i hvide klæder (ApG 1,10).<br/>Vi antager, at de var engle.<br/>Og han sagde: "I Galilæa! hvorfor stå I og stirre op til Himmelen? Denne Jesus, som er taget op fra eder til Himmelen, skal komme på samme Måde, som I have set ham fare op til Himmelen."<br/>De så ham, da han steg op til himlen, og de vil se ham, når han kommer igen. "Se, Herren kommer med titusinder af sine hellige for at eksekvere dommen på jorden" (Jud 1:14-15). Og til ham, som elskede os og gav sig selv for os, og som gjorde os til konger og præster, som skal regere med ham på jorden, se, Herren kommer, og hvert øje skal se ham, og også de, som gennemborede ham, skal sørge. Så Herrens komme. Hvert øje skal se Ham. Jehovas Vidner siger, at Han allerede er kommet, men det var et hemmeligt komme. Da det kun var disciplene, der så Ham gå, var det kun Jehovas Vidners disciple, der så Ham vende tilbage. Men Jesus sagde: "Hvis de siger til jer: 'Han er kommet i det skjulte og er gået ind i et hemmeligt kammer, så tro det ikke'" (Mat 24:26). Så I må vælge, at tro Jesus eller dem.<br/>"Denne Jesus, som er taget op fra jer til himlen, skal komme på samme måde, som I har set ham fare op til himlen."<br/>Nu er der et meget interessant vers i II John, vers ApG 1:7, "For mange bedragere er kommet ind i verden, der bekender ikke, at Jesus Kristus er kommet i kødet." Det er desværre en dårlig oversættelse af det græske. For dette particip er i nutiden og bør oversættes "kommer i kødet." De, der ville benægte, at Jesus Kristus kommer i kødet. Hvad siger Johannes om dem? "De er en bedrager og en antikrist. Se til eder selv, at vi ikke miste det, som vi have gjort, men modtage fuld Løn; thi hver den, som overtræder og ikke bliver i Kristi Lære, har ikke Gud. Den, som bliver i Kristi Lære, han har baade Faderen og Sønnen; og dersom der kommer nogen til din Dør (lørdag Morgen) og ikke kommer med denne Lære, da modtag ham ikke i dit Hus, og byd ham heller ikke Farvel. For den, der byder ham farvel, har del i hans onde gerninger" (2 Joh 1:7-11). Spørg dem et spørgsmål: "Kommer Jesus i kødet?" Bare spørg dem det spørgsmål. Og hvis de siger nej, bare husk på, hvad Johannes advarede dig, og hvad Johannes fortalte dig. "Hvis nogen ikke bekender, at Jesus Kristus kommer i kødet." Kan du huske, da han var med disciplene, og han sagde: "Giv mig noget at spise?" Han sagde: "Du ved, ånder ikke spiser; rør mig. Se, det er mig." Så, denne samme Jesus kommer igen på samme måde, som de så ham gå ind i himlen. Og jeg, for én, tror, at det kommer meget snart.<br/>Så vendte de tilbage til Jerusalem fra det bjerg, som kaldes Oliebjerget, og som ligger fra Jerusalem på en sabbatsdagsrejse. Og da de vare komne ind, gik de op i en Sal ovenpå, hvor de opholdt sig, både Peter og Jakob og Johannes og Andreas og Filip og Thomas og Bartholomæus og Matthæus, Jakob, Alfæus's Søn, og Simon Zelotes og Judas, Jakobs Broder. Og disse holdt alle sammen i bøn og påkaldelse sammen med kvinderne og Maria, Jesu mor, og med hans brødre (ApG 1:12-14).<br/>Dette er den sidste omtale af Maria, Jesu mor. På dette tidspunkt og fra dette punkt er der ingen yderligere omtale af hende i Apostlenes Gerninger eller i brevene. Ingen omtale af hendes død eller af hendes mirakuløse opstigning til himlen, uden død. Intet er nævnt i skriften. Det er tavst.<br/>Hans brødre ville sandsynligvis være en henvisning til Jakob og Judas og til de andre brødre, der var sønner af Josef og Maria.<br/>Det øverste rum - der er nogle, der siger, at det er det samme øvre rum, hvor Jesus havde den sidste nadver med sine disciple. Og alligevel er der andre, der holder til dette øvre rum, der er et rum i templet, hvor den tidlige kirke mødtes. Vælg selv.<br/>Og i de dage stod Peter op midt iblandt disciplene og sagde, (tallet på deres navne tilsammen var omkring 120) mænd og brødre, at dette skriftsted nødvendigvis måtte være blevet opfyldt, som Helligånden ved Davids mund før talte om Judas, som var en vejleder for dem, der tog Jesus (ApG 1:15-16).<br/>De venter i bøn og påkaldelse, og Peter rejser sig og siger: "Der er et skriftsted, der skal opfyldes." Og du ved, han kommer til at gå videre, "Lad os få programmet i gang; lad os kaste lod og finde ud af, hvem der skal tage Judas plads." Jeg føler, at Peter igen var i kødet og manifesterede den impulsive natur, der var hans. Og jeg tror, at kirkens fremtidige historie i Apostlenes Gerninger peger på dette. Jeg er interesseret i Peters forståelse af skrifterne, hvordan han citerer fra så mange steder i Det Gamle Testamente. Peter viser en meget stor forståelse af de gammeltestamentlige skrifter, som er et punkt i hans favør.<br/>Læg mærke til, at Peter tilskriver Helligånden de ting, som David skrev. Så, "Hele Skriften er givet ved inspiration fra Gud" (2Ti 3:16 ). Ikke en del af skrifterne. For hvis du fortæller mig, at en del af skrifterne er givet ved inspiration fra Gud, så må jeg spørge dig: "Hvilke dele er ved inspiration, og hvilke dele er ikke ved inspiration?" Og så er du autoriteten, der fortæller mig, hvilken del jeg kan tro på og hvilken del jeg ikke kan tro på, og så snart Gud ikke længere er autoriteten, men du er autoriteten, er jeg i problemer. Pas på dem, der siger, "Nå, du kan ikke tro alle skrifterne." Skrifterne selv siger, "Hele Skriften er givet ved inspiration fra Gud." Og her, Lukas i skrift om, hvad Peter sagde, erklærer, at David var faktisk talsmand for Helligånden. Helligånden, ved Davids mund, talte om Judas.<br/>Thi han var mønstret hos os, han var en af de tolv, han havde fået en del af denne tjeneste. Men nu købte denne mand en mark med ugudelighedens løn; og han faldt hovedkulds (ApG 1:17-18),<br/>Han købte marken, pottemagerens mark som Zakarias det ellevte kapitel erklærer.<br/>Og da han faldt hovedkulds, brast han i stykker midt iblandt dem, og alle hans indvolde flød ud (ApG 1:18).<br/>Der er dem, der finder en uoverensstemmelse i skrifterne, for i et af evangelierne får vi at vide, at da Judas kom tilbage og forsøgte at returnere pengene, sagde de: "Hey, det er dit problem. Vi kan ikke tage det." Og lægge det tilbage i templets skatkammer. "Det er blodpenge." Så kastede han det der på gulvet i templet, og han gik ud og hængte sig. Her fortæller Peter os, at han faldt hovedkulds og bare poppede. Og der er dem, der forestiller sig en uoverensstemmelse. Meget enkelt gik han op i træet for at hænge sig, bandt rebet om halsen og bandt det til lemmen og sprang. Og faldets kraft enten knækkede rebet eller hovedet, og han faldt ned i kløften og lige som han sagde det her.<br/>Det var kendt af alle indbyggerne i Jerusalem, således at marken kaldes på deres tunge, Aceldama, det vil sige: Blodmarken. For der står skrevet i Salmernes Bog: Lad hans bolig blive øde, og lad ingen bo deri; og: Hans bispedømme lad en anden tage (ApG 1:19-20).<br/>Nu citerer han i virkeligheden fra to forskellige salmer her. Fra Sl 69:25 sætter han det sammen med Sl 109:8. Og sætter de to sammen finder han disse profetier om Judas.<br/>Derfor af disse mænd (ApG 1:21)<br/>Nu er det her, de leder efter nogen til at tage Judas sted for at være apostel. Her er de kvalifikationer, de søgte i den tid.<br/>Derfor af disse mænd, der har været med os hele tiden, at Herren Jesus, når ind og ud blandt os (ApG 1:21),<br/>Nu husker I, at der var mange disciple, mange disciple, hvoraf Jesus udvalgte ti til at være apostle. Og ordet apostel betyder "en, der er udsendt." Eller udvalgte tolv til at være apostle, så han udsendte de tolv. Antallet af menneskelige regering. "Vi har kun elleve. Vi har brug for en til at tage Judas plads, men vi har brug for en, der har været med os hele tiden fra begyndelsen med Jesus."<br/>Fra den dag han blev døbt af Johannes, til den dag han blev taget op fra os, skal man ordineres til at være vidne om hans opstandelse (ApG 1:22).<br/>Så det var de krav, de ledte efter. Nogen, der havde været omkring hele tiden. Fra tidspunktet for Johannes dåb til opstigningen. Og en, der så den opstandne Herre, og dermed kunne bære kendsgerningen om opstandelsen, deres vidnesbyrd om det faktum.<br/>Nu Paulus apostelen, senere i at hævde, at han var en apostel sagde: "Har jeg ikke set den opstandne Kristus?" Åbenbart var det en af kravene i apostelskab. Nogen spurgte mig, "Er der apostle i dag?" Nå, jeg ved det ikke. Jeg tror ikke, at der er i samme forstand, at de var i Det Nye Testamente. Sikkert er der ingen i dag, der kan vidne om opstandelsen, som de gjorde.<br/>De udpegede to, Joseph kaldet Barsabas, der fik tilnavnet Justus, og Matthias. Og de bad og sagde: "Du, Herre, som kender alle menneskers hjerter, vis om af disse to, at du har valgt" (ApG 1:23-24),<br/>Jeg tror, at vi ofte begår den fejl at give Herren to valg, begge forkerte. At begrænse Gud, ser du. Vi er så tilbøjelige til at gøre dette. Selvfølgelig var Paul Guds valg. Peter var impulsiv, og hoppe pistolen sagde, "Hej, vi er nødt til at gøre noget, du ved, nødt til at hjælpe Gud ud. Du ved, en mangler, og vi er nødt til at udfylde ham." Og alligevel, "Gud, hvilken af disse to vil du have?" Og give Gud de to valg.<br/>For at han kan tage del i denne tjeneste og dette apostelembede, hvorfra Judas ved overtrædelsen faldt, så han kunne gå til sit eget sted. Og så gav de deres lod (ApG 1:25-26);<br/>En interessant måde, hvorpå de søgte at bestemme Guds vilje. Lad os kaste terninger, finde ud af, hvad Guds vilje er her. Det er interessant for mig, de forskellige måder, som folk har udtænkt for at skelne Guds vilje. Nu, i Det Gamle Testamente gange havde de en interessant måde at komme til præsten, der ville spørge Herren for dem gennem Urim og Tummim, "lys og fuldkommenheder." Lige hvad disse Urim og Tummim var, ved vi ikke. Jeg er sikker på, at det ikke var de farvede briller, som Joseph Smith fandt med de gyldne tabletter; de magiske briller, at når man tog dem på, kunne man pludselig læse den hieroglyfiske skrift.<br/>Der er dem, der siger, at Urim og Thummim var faktisk en sort og en hvid sten, der blev båret i en pose på brystet af præsten. De ville bede og stille Herren et bestemt spørgsmål. Du husker, at David spurgte Herren om bestemte spørgsmål: "Herre, skal vi gå ud mod filistrene?" Svaret var: "Nej." Så igen, den næste dag, "Herre, skal vi gå ud mod filistrene?" Svaret var: "Ja." "Hvornår skal vi gå?" De ville stille specifikke spørgsmål, og Herren ville lede dem gennem urim og Tommelfinger. De siger, at præsten ville bede, søge Gud, og derefter række ind og trække en af de to sten. Hvis det var den hvide sten, var det et ja svar. Hvis det var et nej, så ville det være den sorte sten, som han ville trække ud. Nogle siger endda, at vi får udtrykket blackballed fra denne Urim og Thummim. Faktisk tilbage i originalen er det et nej imod et bestemt projekt eller en ide. Præcis hvad urim og tummim var, ved vi ikke, men i den gammeltestamentlige periode brugte de en metode til at kaste lod for at bestemme Guds vilje.<br/>Så her samler disciplene op på det samme, som de kaster terningerne for at se, hvilken af de to kammerater, som Gud havde valgt til at erstatte Judas Iskariot.<br/>loddet faldt på Matthias; han blev nummereret med de elleve (ApG 1:26).<br/>Nu hvem i verden er Matthias? Ingen har nogensinde hørt om ham før eller siden. Det bliver interessant at møde Matthias og finde ud af, hvem han er, og hvad han gjorde. Jeg tror fra den efterfølgende historie, det er indlysende at antage, at Gud valgte Paulus som apostel. Paulus erklærer det selv. Nu er det sidste gang, vi læser om dem, der søger at skelne Guds vilje ved lodkastning eller ved en tilfældighed.<br/>Jeg ved, at en mand i dag, når han søger at skelne Herrens vilje, vil bede og stille Herren et spørgsmål. Han har ti pennies i lommen, og mens han beder, tager han pennies med lukkede øjne og lægger dem ned på bordet, og hvis de alle kommer op hoveder, er det et ja. En interessant ting, hver gang i et stykke tid, vil de alle komme op hoveder, og det er temmelig gode odds. Men vi kan ikke finde noget mønster for dette efter Helligånden blev givet. Da Helligånden kom over menigheden, begyndte Helligånden at tale til dem og lede dem. Og Helligånden sagde: "Separer til mig Paulus og Barnabas for den tjeneste, hvor jeg har kaldet dem" (ApG 13:2). Og Helligånden sendte dem ud. Så vi finder kirken mere direkte styret af Helligånden. Når Helligånden kom, blev denne kaste terninger for at finde ud af Guds vilje sat til side.<br/>"<br/><br/>King James-oversættelsen<br/><br/>Dette er 1769 King James Version af Bibelen (også kendt som den autoriserede version).

In fact, dynamic drivers work exactly the same as dynamic microphones but in reverse. Inside a dynamic driver there is a magnet, and when you plug in the headphones, you are sending a AC current through it which will turn the voice coil into a magnet. Depending on the direction of the current, the polarity of the magnet will change. Now since we know for a magnet, same charges repels and different charges attract, we know that the voice coil will move back and forth depending on it's polarity at the time. The voice coil is attached to the diaphragm which will then move back and forth creating a sound wave. The same occurs in reverse, if you move a coil through a magnet you produce a current instead. Since your voice is pushing the diaphragm, it is moving the voice coil back and forth generating the current you have observed.<br/><br/>100+ Head-Fier<br/><br/>Joined:<br/>Nov 7, 2011<br/><br/>Posts:<br/>134<br/><br/>Likes: 55<br/><br/>Exactly.

Inde i en dynamisk driver er der en magnet, og når du tilslutter hovedtelefonerne, sender du en AC-strøm gennem den, som vil gøre talespolen til en magnet. Afhængigt af strømretningen ændres magnetens polaritet. Nu da vi ved for en magnet, samme afgifter frastøder og forskellige afgifter tiltrækker, ved vi, at talespolen vil bevæge sig frem og tilbage afhængigt af dens polaritet på det tidspunkt. Stemmespolen er fastgjort til membranen, som derefter bevæger sig frem og tilbage og skaber en lydbølge. Det samme sker omvendt, hvis du flytter en spole gennem en magnet, producerer du en strøm i stedet.

Stalin's opposition within the party, including Bukharin, Yagoda and Rykov were purged in these show trials, as Stalin manipulatively forced them to confess to crimes of planning a coup and opposing the state, even if there was no proof. Gabor T Rittersporn said, "Many of the victims were sincerely devoted to the principles of Bolshevism." This amplifies proof that the Bolshevik ideals that had once been the roots of the Communist Party were being disarranged and destroyed by the Purges. The party was depleted and former members helplessly watched Stalin use the great purge as a tool to transform Russia from a one party state to an unchallenged dictatorship. Again, the purges were shattering the framework of the Communist Party, formed during the Bolshevik revolution. This agrees with the "Stalin the executioner" source as both show the manipulative character, that helped the dictator to enhance his grip on Russia's throat.<br/>The manipulative manner, with which Stalin incriminated his targeted opposition during the purges, in the eyes of everyday Russians, also had an implosive impact on Soviet Society. Stalin was able to collect support from the people through his use of propaganda and the media to help him develop a "cult of personality" and the image of a heroic and brave leader. Through this support Stalin implanted mistrust into the minds of the people, convincing them that traitors of the revolution and what he described as 'enemies of the people', were amongst them.

Stalins modstand inden for partiet, herunder Bukharin, Jagoda og Rykov blev udrenset i disse skueprocesser, da Stalin manipulativt tvang dem til at tilstå forbrydelser med at planlægge et kup og modsætte sig staten, selvom der ikke var noget bevis. Gabor T Rittersporn sagde: "Mange af ofrene var oprigtigt hengivne til bolsjevismens principper." Dette forstærker beviset for, at de bolsjevikiske idealer, der engang havde været kommunistpartiets rødder, blev forstyrret og ødelagt af udrensningerne. Partiet var udtømt, og tidligere medlemmer så hjælpeløst Stalin bruge den store udrensning som et redskab til at omdanne Rusland fra en enpartistat til et uimodsagt diktatur.

Det er gennem studiet af sociologi, at den virkelig videnskabelige undersøgelse af samfundet har været mulig.

| Supercell is nerfing brawlers instead of nerfing star powers. I was at 750 last season with power 8 nita and it is very tough to go past that, like, star powers play a really dominant role. The matchmaking is also trash. When i play gem grab(around 600 trophies), there are often matchups where the enemy team has one more player than us who is maxed and it's not even that we have a lvl 9 to compete versus that. Sometimes there are even matchups where the enemy team is fully maxed and none of us are. this is why i dont play brawl stars seriously anymore. It's not even like there arent many players who are not maxed and around 600 trophies. It's annoying.<br/>Edit: I think supercell should have at least a basic mechanism that takes the average of levels of brawlers when setting up matches.<br/><br/>Except trophies don't really indicate your skill. They indicate the skill of the teammates you are placed with. And I'm fine with playing against higher level brawlers, but when one team is all level 10 and the other team isn't, clearly it's unbalanced.<br/><br/>I reccomend getting some good friends to play with, me and 2 friends got my friends power 1 tick to rank 28 by playing gem grab with a certain composition all day and we made it without a single one of us being maxed with our brawlers.<br/><br/>I Know how you feel I used to have brawlers in high trophies with low level and it's to difficult to go more further and everything I was saying to myself "I want to have star powers" really supercell needs to make balance to the star powers or at least make a better matchmaking system.<br/><br/>I kinda feel this. I ain't as good at the game as you, but I got Emz to 500 at power 1 and the matchmaking was horrible. Maxed out players everywhere! And it didn't help that the majority of my teammates had around 5-8k trophies... I had to resort to solo showdown last minute because I can either ambush unsuspecting players or simply play a little aggressive at the right times. But I really wish that it could be a bit easier for people who want to push brawlers to really high trophy ranges without having the luxury of star powers.<br/><br/>Altho spike is still good without curveball. Curveball was just a help for hitting your shots more often as spike. But even before curveball was released, spike was a really strong brawler, so he will remain the same now.<br/><br/>I agree that they should have nerfed ambush, but I think they are trying to balance both Snappy Sniping and Ambush, as they are both getting merged with this change. She was becoming a little powerful, but still not nerf-worthy<br/><br/>I'm not sure about this, but now that Darryl got a noticeable buff, looking at their new stats, it looks like Darryl might overshadow Bull, as not only he can always deal more damage than Bull, he won't die as early anymore, so their survivability will be similar without star power (although Bull's survivability is still noticeably better than Darryl's if he had Tough Guy). Not only that, Darryl's super can auto regenerate, meaning Darryl MIGHT be able to be played effectively both as a heavyweight AND an assassin at the same time (before he sucks as a heavyweight but decent as an assassin)<br/><br/>But hes overrated af. And you get trophies with him really easily. So im kinda ok with the nerf. I havent even played him since when I got him to 500 (around 5 months ago), so not that I care that much either.<br/><br/>Why doesn't Poco/Penny get a HP nerf, if they are Marksman/Healer respectively not a tank?<br/>Why isn't Rosa's tankyness nerfed, cough 70% damage reduction?<br/>Why is Tick allowed to have the highest range and the most free pokedamage in the entire game?<br/>Why doesn't Leon get a HP/Damage buff?<br/><br/>Be that as it may, it was Ambush that was OP, not base Piper. I would argue that Ambush is the best star power in the game (now even more so since the percentage of damage increase indirectly went up) and base Piper was a bottom-10 brawler.<br/><br/>What Supercell should do is revert both nerfs, reduce Ambush to 600, and reduce Snappy Sniping to 0.25 since it'd be indirectly buffed by the base damage buff.<br/><br/>Yea and I believe they went a bit too far with Rosa, because now she is basically the better bull now when it comes to tanking, which she has been for a while. Now, Darryl might as well be a smaller, more powerful bull<br/><br/>Why? I feel she needs a buff in almost everything except her star power. Her health and speed make her super a bit more difficult to use, because she can die pretty easily, and it is really difficult for her to trap faster brawlers like Crow. Her star power is a bit broken though... | Supercell er nervøse brawlers i stedet for nervøse stjernekræfter. Jeg var på 750 sidste sæson med power 8 nita, og det er meget svært at gå forbi, ligesom stjernekræfter spiller en virkelig dominerende rolle. Matchmaking er også affald. Når jeg spiller gem grab (omkring 600 trofæer), er der ofte matchups, hvor fjendens hold har en mere spiller end os, der er maxed, og det er ikke engang, at vi har en lvl 9 til at konkurrere mod det. Nogle gange er der endda matchups, hvor fjenden holdet er fuldt maxed og ingen af os er. det er derfor, jeg ikke spiller slagsmål stjerner alvorligt længere. Det er ikke engang ligesom der ikke er mange spillere, der ikke er maxed og omkring 600 trofæer. Det er irriterende.<br/>EDIT: Jeg synes supercelle skal have mindst en grundlæggende mekanisme, der tager gennemsnittet af niveauer af slagsmål, når du opretter kampe.<br/><br/>Bortset fra trofæer indikerer ikke rigtig din færdighed. De angiver dygtighed af holdkammerater du er placeret med. Og jeg har det fint med at spille mod højere niveau slagsmål, men når et hold er alle niveau 10 og det andet hold er ikke, klart det er ubalanceret.<br/><br/>Jeg anbefaler at få nogle gode venner til at lege med, mig og 2 venner fik mine venner magt 1 tick til rang 28 ved at spille perle grab med en bestemt sammensætning hele dagen, og vi gjorde det uden en eneste af os bliver maxed med vores slagsmål.<br/><br/>Jeg ved, hvordan du føler, jeg plejede at have brawlers i høje trofæer med lavt niveau, og det er for svært at gå længere, og alt hvad jeg sagde til mig selv "Jeg vil have stjernekræfter" virkelig supercelle behov for at skabe balance til stjernekræfterne eller i det mindste lave et bedre matchmaking system.<br/><br/>Jeg er ikke så god til spillet som dig, men jeg fik Emz til 500 ved magt 1 og matchmaking var forfærdeligt. Maxed ud spillere overalt! Og det hjalp ikke, at de fleste af mine holdkammerater havde omkring 5-8k trofæer ... Jeg var nødt til at ty til solo showdown i sidste øjeblik, fordi jeg enten kan baghold intetanende spillere eller bare spille lidt aggressiv på de rigtige tidspunkter. Men jeg ville virkelig ønske, at det kunne være lidt lettere for folk, der ønsker at skubbe brawlers til virkelig høje trofæområder uden at have luksusen af stjernekræfter.<br/><br/>Altho spike er stadig god uden curveball. Curveball var bare en hjælp til at ramme dine skud oftere som spike. Men selv før curveball blev frigivet, spike var en virkelig stærk brawler, så han vil forblive den samme nu.<br/><br/>Jeg er enig i, at de skulle have nervøst baghold, men jeg tror, at de forsøger at balancere både Snappy Sniping og Ambush, da de begge bliver fusioneret med denne ændring. Hun blev lidt kraftig, men stadig ikke nervøs værdig<br/><br/>Jeg er ikke sikker på dette, men nu da Darryl fik en mærkbar buff, ser på deres nye statistik, ser det ud til, at Darryl måske overskygger Bull, da han ikke kun altid kan håndtere mere skade end Bull, han vil ikke dø så tidligt længere, så deres overlevelsesevne vil være ens uden stjernekraft (selvom Bulls overlevelsesevne stadig er mærkbart bedre end Darryls, hvis han havde Tough Guy). Ikke kun det, Darryls super kan automatisk regenerere, hvilket betyder, at Darryl KAN spilles effektivt både som en sværvægter OG en snigmorder på samme tid (før han suger som en sværvægter, men anstændig som en snigmorder)<br/><br/>Men han er overvurderet af. Og du får trofæer med ham virkelig nemt. Så im kinda ok med nerv. Jeg har ikke selv spillet ham siden da jeg fik ham til 500 (omkring 5 måneder siden), så ikke at jeg bekymrer mig så meget enten.<br/><br/>Hvorfor får Poco/Penny ikke en HP nerf, hvis de er henholdsvis Marksman/Healer og ikke en tank?<br/>Hvorfor er Rosas tankyness ikke nervøs, hoste 70% skadereduktion?<br/>Hvorfor er Tick tilladt at have den højeste rækkevidde og den mest gratis pokedamage i hele spillet?<br/>Hvorfor får Leon ikke en HP/Damage buff?<br/><br/>Det var dog Ambush, der var OP, ikke base Piper. Jeg vil hævde, at Ambush er den bedste stjernekraft i spillet (nu endnu mere, da procentdelen af skaden stiger indirekte) og base Piper var en bund-10 brawler.<br/><br/>Hvad Supercell skal gøre er at vende tilbage begge nerver, reducere Ambush til 600, og reducere Snappy Sniping til 0,25, da det ville være indirekte buffed af basen skade buff.<br/><br/>Ja, og jeg tror, at de gik lidt for langt med Rosa, for nu er hun dybest set den bedre tyr nu, når det kommer til tanking, som hun har været i et stykke tid. Nu kunne Darryl lige så godt være en mindre, mere kraftfuld tyr<br/><br/>Hvorfor? Jeg føler, at hun har brug for en buff i næsten alt undtagen hendes stjernekraft. Hendes helbred og hastighed gør hende super lidt vanskeligere at bruge, fordi hun kan dø temmelig let, og det er virkelig svært for hende at fange hurtigere slagsmål som Crow. Hendes stjernekraft er dog lidt brækket... |

| Self-Employment Part 1<br/><br/>When you accept an employment in any organisation, you have to perform various jobs as per the requirements of your employer and you may get a fixed amount of income as salary. You may run a small retail shop, tailoring shop, restaurant, bakery and confectionery, beauty salon, etc. in your locality. You may get engaged in trading or manufacturing on a small scale or providing some service for a price. Such economic activities are known as self-employment.<br/><br/>Meaning of Self-Employment<br/><br/>Earning is necessary for a living. Our father, mother, brothers, sisters and others may be engaged in different economic activities through which they earn their livelihood. These persons are engaged in an economic activity which is termed as wage employment or paid employment. But there are many persons who engage themselves in an occupation or some business which they start and manage on their own. They put in their best effort and take all types of risks to pursue their careers successfully. The entire earning of their work goes to them. All of us have seen small grocery shops, tailoring shops, medical stores etc. in our locality. These are owned and managed by a person, with or without the help of some assistants. Their economic activities are termed as self-employment. So, when an individual engages in any economic activity and manages it on his own, it is known as self-employment.<br/><br/>Objectives<br/><br/>After studying this lesson, you will be able to:<br/><br/>Image of Objectives<br/><br/>Image of Objectives<br/><br/>Characteristics of Self-Employment<br/><br/>It involves ownership and management of activities by a person although he/she may take the help of one or two persons to assist him/her. Thus, self-employment may provide employment to other persons as well.<br/><br/>The earning from self-employment is not fixed. It depends on the income one can earn by producing or buying and selling goods or providing services to others at a price.<br/><br/>In self-employment, the owner alone has to take the profit and bear the risk of loss. So, we find a direct link between the effort and reward in self-employment.<br/><br/>It requires some amount of capital investment, although it may be small.<br/><br/>In self-employment, a person is free to take decisions in respect of running his business profitably and avail of any opportunity that may come up for expansion of his business. It gives complete freedom to work as per one's own will and within the parameters of the prevailing laws.<br/><br/>Thus, self-employment may be defined as, an economic activity which one may perform on his own as a gainful occupation, and this may consist of producing and selling goods, buying and selling goods, or rendering services for a price. | Selvstændig beskæftigelse del 1<br/><br/>Når du accepterer en ansættelse i en organisation, skal du udføre forskellige job i henhold til din arbejdsgivers krav, og du kan få et fast indkomstbeløb som løn. Du kan køre en lille detailbutik, skræddersy butik, restaurant, bageri og konfekture, skønhedssalon, etc. i din lokalitet. Du kan blive engageret i handel eller fremstilling på en lille skala eller yde nogle service til en pris. Sådanne økonomiske aktiviteter er kendt som selvstændig virksomhed.<br/><br/>Betydningen af selvstændig beskæftigelse<br/><br/>Vores far, mor, brødre, søstre og andre kan være involveret i forskellige økonomiske aktiviteter, hvorigennem de tjener deres levebrød. Disse personer er beskæftiget med en økonomisk aktivitet, der betegnes som lønarbejde eller lønnet beskæftigelse. Men der er mange personer, der engagerer sig i et erhverv eller en virksomhed, som de starter og styrer på egen hånd. De gør deres bedste og tager alle former for risici for at forfølge deres karriere med succes. Hele indtjeningen af deres arbejde går til dem. Vi har alle set små købmandsforretninger, skræddersy butikker, medicinske butikker osv. i vores lokalitet. Disse ejes og forvaltes af en person, med eller uden hjælp fra nogle assistenter. Deres økonomiske aktiviteter betegnes som selvstændig virksomhed. Så når en person engagerer sig i enhver økonomisk aktivitet og styrer det alene, er det kendt som selvstændig virksomhed.<br/><br/>Målsætninger<br/><br/>Efter at have studeret denne lektion, vil du være i stand til at:<br/><br/>Billede af objektiver<br/><br/>Billede af objektiver<br/><br/>Egenskaber ved selvstændig beskæftigelse<br/><br/>Det indebærer ejerskab og ledelse af aktiviteter af en person, selv om han / hun kan tage hjælp af en eller to personer til at hjælpe ham / hende. Således kan selvstændig virksomhed give beskæftigelse til andre personer også.<br/><br/>Indtjeningen fra selvstændig virksomhed er ikke fast. Det afhænger af den indkomst, man kan tjene ved at producere eller købe og sælge varer eller levere tjenesteydelser til andre til en pris.<br/><br/>I selvstændig virksomhed skal ejeren alene tage overskuddet og bære risikoen for tab. Så vi finder en direkte sammenhæng mellem indsatsen og belønningen i selvstændig virksomhed.<br/><br/>Det kræver en vis mængde kapitalinvesteringer, selv om det kan være små.<br/><br/>I selvstændig virksomhed, er en person fri til at træffe beslutninger med hensyn til at køre sin virksomhed rentabelt og benytte enhver mulighed, der kan komme op for udvidelse af sin virksomhed. Det giver fuldstændig frihed til at arbejde efter sin egen vilje og inden for rammerne af de gældende love.<br/><br/>Således kan selvstændig virksomhed defineres som en økonomisk aktivitet, som man kan udføre på egen hånd som en lønnet beskæftigelse, og dette kan bestå i at producere og sælge varer, købe og sælge varer eller yde tjenesteydelser til en pris. |
