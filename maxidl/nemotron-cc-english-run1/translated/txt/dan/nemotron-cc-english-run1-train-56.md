| While acknowledging that it's impossible to argue someone into loving something they hate, and vice versa, it's still often enjoyable to attempt the argument. When we talk to people whose opinions directly contradict ours, we're forced to defend our tastes, define our opinions, and analyze why we react the way we do. Which is why we have Why Don't You Like This?, in which two of our staffers will attempt to discover whether people with opposing opinions can get beyond "No, you're wrong!" and have a civil, constructive, and possibly even convincing discussion about their points of contention. Because no matter what talk radio says, there's still a middle ground between "We agree utterly" and "I'm right, and you're stupid and evil."<br/><br/>Scott: Since discussing my Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World apostasy, we've been looking for a case where I can call you out for not liking something wonderful, and we didn't have to look for long. We were sitting right next to each other during Martin Scorsese's Hugo—me, utterly enchanted by its fantastical tribute to the wonders of early silent cinema, and you, apparently resisting it at every turn. Critical consensus has been on my side: It hit the No. 9 spot on our collective Top 15 (though you listed it as your Overrated choice), has won (or placed) in various film-critic awards, and currently enjoys an 83 score on Metacritic. That doesn't mean you're wrong, of course, but the onus is on you to explain why Hugo was, in your words, "hollow and artificial," where many of us saw it as a lovely evocation of Scorsese's childhood and the medium when it was still in its infancy. And please be gentle as you rip this butterfly apart by the wings.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Tasha: I can't be gentle, Scott. Sometimes it hurts less if you rip the Band-Aid off all at once. (And even if it doesn't, who wants to walk around wearing a half-ripped-off Band-Aid? Gross.) The fact is, I found Hugo to be a wearyingly manipulative exercise in fakery, starting from its opening glide through a Paris train station, which reminded me more than anything of Robert Zemeckis' The Polar Express. Unlike Mike D'Angelo, I'm a fan of long, unbroken takes as a way of establishing a space and encouraging viewers to unconsciously hold their breaths as a camera explores an area; but when the space being explored is a slick, shiny CGI creation, and the camera floats weightlessly through it with no physical sense that either the camera or the surroundings are really there, that exploration starts to feel like watching someone else play a videogame. And the rest of the film felt similarly poreless and unreal to me, both in terms of its setting and in terms of its highly contrived, maudlin story.<br/><br/>I don't necessarily have a problem with manufactured, stylized environments in film. I loved Baz Luhrmann's equally sprawling, utterly artificial take on Paris in Moulin Rouge, for instance, but that film has a sense of its own ridiculousness, a sense of humor about how deliberately over-the-top it is. Ditto the stylization of Jean-Pierre Jeunet, particularly in Amélie. (Both Jeunet and Luhrmann felt like strong visual influences here.) I got the sense, however, that Martin Scorsese wanted me to take Hugo entirely seriously. Even though it's yet another achingly sentimental story about a plucky orphan bringing color back into the life of a grumpy old curmudgeon. And I just couldn't.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>There is nothing I enjoy more in film than being surprised. And there's nothing I resent and resist more than being overtly manipulated, being loudly told what to feel and when to feel it. A good film does this kind of thing subtly; a bad one uses crashing music cues and sweet strings—and in this case, a grubby, huge-eyed, disheveled orphan staring woefully at the camera—to demand pathos, and to tell viewers they're horrible people if they don't serve it up on demand. That said, I can deal with sad kids and grumpy adults making life better for each other—I really dug this year's Le Havre, which was essentially the same plot without all the cutesiness—but I find the artificial environments reflect badly on the artificial emotions, and each makes the other seem more fake by turns.<br/><br/>Let's start with that. In our overlooked films video, you and Noel both took Keith to task for championing Tyrannosaur, because you felt it wasn't realistic enough—too contrived, too miserablist, too much, too far. How is it possible that you can't buy a stymied old crank who breaks things when he's angry, but you can buy an orphan living inside a giant train-station clock and embarking upon a whimsical journey to repair a mysterious automaton that he believes might bear secrets from his dead father, but which instead leads him on a quirky voyage of self-discovery, into the magical land of cinema? Did you never find Hugo's gaudy rococo design, aggressive heartstring-plucking, or wheelbarrow-loads of quirk even a little excessive or hard to swallow?<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Scott: Jeunet and Luhrmann as influences on Scorsese?! Forget being indelicate, now you're deliberately poking me with a sharp stick. If you're looking for inspirations for Hugo—indeed, if you're looking for the emotional core of Hugo—you have to go back to Scorsese's childhood on Elizabeth Street in Little Italy, where an asthmatic little boy, unable to play outside with the other kids, retreated to Alexander Korda fantasies like The Thief Of Bagdad. Or, more simply, just go straight to the source himself: George Méliès, whose A Trip To The Moon remains the Big Bang of all cinematic fantasies, that moment when the camera was not used to document the world as it is, but whatever whimsical, magical, transporting place a filmmaker wants to invent for it. And that tradition has been developed and expanded upon for decades before the likes of Jeunet and Luhrmann got their grubby little paws on it.<br/><br/>And speaking of Jeunet, nice attempt to take away my rhetorical weapon, but I'll say it anyway: How can you love Amélie, yet find Hugo synthetic and "excessive" and "wearyingly manipulative"? You say that Amélie and Moulin Rouge have redeeming "sense of [their] own ridiculousness" where Scorsese means us to take Hugo seriously, and I don't think that's the case, at least on the latter point. That Scorsese feels evident passion about the movies is, I suppose, why you'd interpret Hugo as self-serious. But to me, it's those feelings that give the film an emotional ballast that the Luhrmann and Jeunet films don't have. All three films make aggressive use of the marvels of CGI—and Scorsese adds 3D to the mix, to wonderful effect—but where you and I differ is on the issue of weightlessness. I agree that CGI has a distancing effect; worlds composed entirely of digital plasticine are flexible to the point where they sometimes have no presence. You referred to Hugo in your "Overrated" entry for our Best Of Film piece as "a CGI gimcrack"—a perfect dis… for another movie.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>It's fair to say that Scorsese has built Hugo around a standard-issue, "heartstring-plucking" children's book/movie plot: Orphan misses his daddy, creates his own little fantasy world, gloms onto a new friend, convinces a crusty old fuddy-duddy to soften up and maybe adopt him. But that's just the narrative skeleton, and Scorsese provides plenty of flesh and blood. For one, you can't watch Hugo, the lonely boy, peering out from clock towers to the hustle-and-bustle of a Paris train station without thinking of Scorsese, another lonely boy, staring out of his bedroom window on Elizabeth Street. And even if you're not a big enough film nerd to make that connection, I really feel like Hugo's journey is not in finding a new father figure, but in persisting with the mechanical magic that stands as his own father's legacy. That's what film is: The persistence of vision that allows us to accept an illusory version of the world at 24 frames per second is science and magic at once. Hugo's relationship with Méliès isn't about him cozying up to a new daddy, but sharing a common enthusiasm the old man has submerged in bitterness. To me, that's a far more unique angle on a potentially shopworn premise.<br/><br/>Did you really find none of Hugo enchanting? Even the film's few detractors seem willing to admit that the sequences evoking cinema history and Méliès' studio—with Michael Stuhlbarg as the heroic film scholar!—were terrific. It felt, in the best possible way, like a heady compression of my History Of Film 101 class in college, condensing a semester's worth of clips and context into something between a montage and an animated pop-up book. And it speaks to the ingenious design of the film, which layers fact and fantasy so beautifully that it's at once a history of Méliès and the birth of cinema, and just the sort of simple, sumptuously produced cinematic wonder that Scorsese himself would have loved as a child. Thank goodness Hugo doesn't follow the Jeunet/Luhrmann model and have "a sense of its own ridiculousness." As a fantasy connoisseur yourself, wouldn't you say there's value in playing it straight and earnest and unabashed rather than winking at the audience? You may find Hugo sickly sweet, but I don't think the authenticity of its sentiment is to be denied.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Tasha: Yes, I did in fact find parts of Hugo enchanting. (Notice how I'm answering your question up front, whereas you were too busy frothing with apoplexy to address mine, though I assume that's an answer in its own right. Okay, "influence" may be overstating the case—I just meant the visual style looked very familiar. Though as Keith pointed out when you brought this up in person, Scorsese is neither opposed to drawing inspiration from other people's visuals, nor immune to it.) Primarily, I was enchanted by the parts dealing with Georges Méliès' backstory, with his love of cinema, with the work he put into his art and the joy he got out of it. There's an awful lot of beauty and fun in the staging of the underwater-court scene from Méliès' "Fairyland," and in the sequence at the end, focusing on Méliès footage. I'll grant you that Hugo's connection with Méliès over a shared love of film is a nice touch. And I do enjoy a good film about filmmaking.<br/><br/>But Hugo isn't primarily about film, in spite of the Méliès tie-ins. In addition to the themes you cite, it's also about finding your purpose, as the characters expressly, laboriously explain to each other and to us. And it's about spectacle, and big action setpieces, and chases, and happily-ever-after endings where even the angry bully and the shy older couple and fergawdsakes even the cranky dachshund all get paired off with charming love interests by the end. It's about the super-precocious Hermione Granger-type being bossy and perky and clever and praising the magical worlds encased in books. And all of this business is mighty familiar, and mighty artificial.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Yes, Scorsese is playing with archetypes. Problem is, I never felt he imbued them with anything new, fresh, or believable, in spite of his own backstory. I would have much preferred a story about a young Scorsese growing up with asthma—something small-scale and real, without vast rooms full of CGI clockwork and golden glowing dust-motes and prophetic dreams and a raging adult tyrant-guard with a heart of gold—all of that outsized, over-the-top nonsense. You keep citing Scorsese's personal background and love of film as evidence that he's really feeling what he's putting on the screen, but I don't feel his personal touch in any of this, except the moments that are expressly about film. The core emotions may be real, but that doesn't make the execution less false.<br/><br/>You say the authenticity of the emotion isn't to be denied. I don't question whether Scorsese personally felt lonely and isolated as a child, but I don't feel loneliness and isolation on the screen—I see a bunch of exaggerated signifiers (Hugo is filthy and his clothes are worn and all the adults yell at him and he regularly gets chased by a scary dog!) and big beats, with shouting and weeping and Spielbergian wonder-emoting. For me, sincerity is more convincing and more personal when it's quiet and direct; when someone's shouting his opinions at me, I assume he's either really angry, or just trying to overwhelm my senses to keep me from expressing my own opinion. Hugo was one long shout, as far as I was concerned.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Why didn't I get that sense of fakery from Amélie, you ask? Actually, I did. I'll completely acknowledge that Amélie and Moulin Rouge are both big, manipulative, artificial constructions in the exact same vein, demanding specific emotions at specific intervals, and trying to sell those emotions with heavy emoting and aggressive soundtrack prodding. Neither of them really sold me on their emotions as authentic human feeling. What I enjoyed in those two films was the construction—particularly Amélie's heady, laughable lists of random characterizing features and experiences for its cast, and Moulin Rouge's musical-magpie mashups and recontextualizations. I'm often sold on stories that do creative or ambitious things with structure, and both of those movies qualify, where Hugo is a much more linear, standard kid-quest.<br/><br/>But in the end, for me, it really does come down to a feeling that those movies are goofs, whereas Hugo is meant to be taken seriously at every treacly moment. You don't think that's true—but you're simultaneously defending its integrity in terms of its absolutely authentic, rooted-in-Scorsese's-history emotion, and telling me I'm wrong, and he doesn't mean it to be taken seriously. How do you reconcile those two statements? What about the film suggests to you that it isn't meant to be taken at face value? And is it possible this is just another Curious Case Of Benjamin Button-like situation where I find the use of kids in big-budget films to be largely sappy and melodramatic, whereas you as a dad find it bypasses your cynicism and goes straight to your family-feeling?<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Scott: Not sure I meant that Scorsese doesn't mean to be taken seriously; it's just that he's chosen a whimsical vehicle through which to express a serious love of the movies. When you say, "But Hugo isn't primarily about film, in spite of the Méliès tie-ins," I'm mystified. I grant that you find many elements of Hugo overly familiar and laborious and full of Spielbergian wonder-emoting—there's nothing I can do to argue around that perception, which other Hugo doubters share. Sometimes a film means to charm and enchant, and it doesn't for some; you've got Hugo and I've got Amélie, though I think the latter, deliberately artificial as it is, means for us to find it romantic. (Rather than, say, some horrible mechanical contraption fit for a Saw sequel.)<br/><br/>But to say Hugo isn't primarily about film? If it's not about film, then it's the most pointlessly discursive story about [whatever you think it's about] I've ever seen. The relationship between Hugo and Méliès is the heart of the movie, and at the heart of that is not just some stock connection between Plucky Orphan and Crusty Old Guy With A Heart Of Gold, but a shared affinity for engineered magic—specifically the magic of the movies. I think Scorsese and his collaborators have found a way to express their enthusiasm over the early days of cinema through a fantasy that's accessible to all ages. The archetype-filled children's tale is the merely the crust here; cinema is the pie. (Mmmm… pie.)<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>As for The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button, I don't see much of a connection, other than trying to expose me as a Benjamin Button defender as a way of damaging my credibility. (Incidentally, how are the extras on that G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra Blu-ray?) I've said to you that the sleep-deprived new dad in me was perhaps vulnerable to Benjamin Button, but I can't imagine a time when the premise of aging in reverse wouldn't move me. (Cradling the love of your life in your arms as an infant? How can you not be affected by that?) And besides, I don't see how Benjamin Button relates much to Hugo as a film concerning kids, since that's just a small segment of a story that spans a much larger trajectory.<br/><br/>So have I convinced you? Likely not. But I'm happy to learn that Hugo wasn't entirely devoid of enchantments for you. The sequences on Méliès the filmmaker are what put Hugo over for me—and in that, at least, we can share some movie love.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Tasha: Nope, I can't say you've convinced me, any more than I've convinced you. It's impossible to argue anyone into a visceral love of anything, and it really should be equally impossible to talk someone down from visceral love. Mostly, you've let me see Hugo in Scott-O-Vision, which is an interesting experience; at least now I'm mildly convinced that we didn't somehow manage to see entirely different films which both somehow had the same name and director.<br/><br/>We certainly had different experiences, though, and to my mind, focused on different aspects of the production: I still don't see the "film is marvelous" theme as the movie's single strand, so much as one among too many. "Pointlessly discursive" almost covers it, though I'd throw in "often needlessly cutesy and precious" on top of that. While you're focused on the film's tasty pie filling, I feel like that pie was covered with a pound of crystallized sugar, and I think that does make a difference, regardless of the film's core message or handful of terrific scenes. See also Benjamin Button, which I did not bring up just to chafe you—I really do think you have more of a sentimental streak than I do regarding children in cinema, especially when they're used more as symbols of vulnerability and innocence than as human characters. Hey, you know what film totally does not have cute wide-eyed moppets bringing hope to a cynical world? G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra. Maybe I will go watch those Blu-ray extras. I could use some explosion-insulin to compensate for Hugo's sweetness. | Mens man anerkender, at det er umuligt at argumentere nogen til at elske noget, de hader, og omvendt, er det stadig ofte sjovt at forsøge argumentet.

For uanset hvad radioen siger, er der stadig en mellemvej mellem "Vi er helt enige" og "Jeg har ret, og du er dum og ond."<br/><br/>Scott: Siden vi diskuterede min Scott Pilgrim Vs. Verdens frafald, har vi ledt efter en sag, hvor jeg kan kalde dig ud for ikke at kunne lide noget vidunderligt, og vi behøvede ikke at lede længe. Vi sad lige ved siden af hinanden under Martin Scorseses Hugo-me, helt fortryllet af sin fantastiske hyldest til vidundere i tidlig stumfilm, og du tilsyneladende modstå det på hver tur. Kritisk konsensus har været på min side: Det ramte nr. 9 på vores kollektive Top 15 (selvom du noterede det som dit overvurderede valg), har vundet (eller placeret) i forskellige filmkritikpriser og har i øjeblikket en 83-score på Metacritic. Det betyder selvfølgelig ikke, at du tager fejl, men det er op til dig at forklare, hvorfor Hugo med dine ord var "hul og kunstig", hvor mange af os så det som en dejlig fremkaldelse af Scorseses barndom og mediet, da det stadig var i sin barndom. Og vær venlig at være blid, når du river sommerfuglen i stykker ved vingerne.<br/><br/>Annonce<br/><br/>Tasha: Jeg kan ikke være blid, Scott. Nogle gange gør det mindre ondt, hvis du river Band-Aid af på en gang. (Og selvom det ikke gør det, hvem vil gå rundt iført en halv-rippet-off Band-Aid? Gross.) Faktum er, at jeg fandt Hugo at være en trættende manipulerende øvelse i fakery, startende fra dens åbning glide gennem en Paris togstation, som mindede mig mere end noget andet af Robert Zemeckis 'The Polar Express. I modsætning til Mike D'Angelo er jeg en fan af lange, ubrudte tager som en måde at etablere et rum og opmuntre seerne til ubevidst at holde vejret, da et kamera udforsker et område; men når det rum, der udforskes, er en glat, skinnende CGI-skabelse, og kameraet flyder vægtløst gennem det uden fysisk følelse af, at enten kameraet eller omgivelserne virkelig er der, begynder den udforskning at føle sig som at se en anden spille et videospil. Og resten af filmen føltes på samme måde poreløs og uvirkelig for mig, både med hensyn til dens indstilling og med hensyn til dens meget udtænkte, maudlin historie.<br/><br/>Jeg har ikke nødvendigvis et problem med fremstillede, stiliserede miljøer i film. Jeg elskede for eksempel Baz Luhrmanns lige så vidtstrakte, helt kunstige fortolkning af Paris i Moulin Rouge, men den film har en følelse af sin egen latterlighed, en sans for humor om, hvor bevidst over-the-top det er. Dito stiliseringen af Jean-Pierre Jeunet, især i Amélie. (Både Jeunet og Luhrmann følte sig som stærke visuelle påvirkninger her.) Jeg fik dog fornemmelsen af, at Martin Scorsese ville have mig til at tage Hugo helt alvorligt. Selvom det er endnu en pinefuld sentimental historie om et modigt forældreløst barn, der bringer farve tilbage i livet som en gnaven gammel kurmudgeon, og det kunne jeg bare ikke.<br/><br/>Annonce<br/><br/>Der er ikke noget, jeg nyder mere i film end at blive overrasket. Og der er ikke noget, jeg harmes og modstår mere end at blive åbenlyst manipuleret, bliver højt fortalt, hvad de skal føle og hvornår de skal føle det. En god film gør denne slags ting subtilt; en dårlig bruger crashing musik stikord og søde strenge - og i dette tilfælde, en grubby, kæmpe-eyed, disheveled forældreløse stirrer sørgeligt på kameraet - at kræve patos, og at fortælle seerne, at de er forfærdelige mennesker, hvis de ikke tjener det op på efterspørgslen. Når det er sagt, kan jeg håndtere triste børn og grumpy voksne gør livet bedre for hinanden-jeg virkelig gravet dette års Le Havre, som var i det væsentlige det samme plot uden alle cutesiness-men jeg finder de kunstige miljøer afspejler dårligt på de kunstige følelser, og hver gør den anden synes mere falsk ved sving.<br/><br/>Lad os starte med det. I vores oversete filmvideo tog du og Noel begge Keith til opgave for at kæmpe for Tyrannosaur, fordi du følte, at det ikke var realistisk nok - for konstrueret, for miserablist, for meget, for langt. Hvordan er det muligt, at du ikke kan købe en stymied gammel krumtap, der bryder ting, når han er vred, men du kan købe en forældreløs, der bor inde i et kæmpe togstationsur og går i gang med en lunefuld rejse for at reparere en mystisk automat, som han tror kan bære hemmeligheder fra sin døde far, men som i stedet fører ham på en quirky rejse af selvopdagelse ind i biografens magiske land? Fandt du aldrig Hugos prangende rokoko design, aggressive heartstring-plukning, eller trillebør-belastninger af quirk selv lidt overdreven eller svært at sluge?<br/><br/>Annonce<br/><br/>Scott: Jeunet og Luhrmann som påvirkninger på Scorsese?! Glem at være ubesværet, nu er du bevidst stikker mig med en skarp pind. Hvis du leder efter inspiration til Hugo-faktisk, hvis du leder efter den følelsesmæssige kerne af Hugo-du er nødt til at gå tilbage til Scorseses barndom på Elizabeth Street i Little Italy, hvor en astmatisk lille dreng, ude af stand til at lege udenfor med de andre børn, trak sig tilbage til Alexander Korda fantasier som The Thief Of Bagdad. Eller rettere sagt, bare gå direkte til kilden selv: George Mélies, hvis A Trip To The Moon forbliver Big Bang af alle filmiske fantasier, det øjeblik, hvor kameraet ikke blev brugt til at dokumentere verden, som den er, men uanset lunefuldt, magisk, transportsted en filmskaber ønsker at opfinde for det. Og den tradition er blevet udviklet og udvidet i årtier, før folk som Jeunet og Luhrmann fik deres grubbede små poter på den.<br/><br/>Og apropos Jeunet, pænt forsøg på at tage mit retoriske våben fra mig, men jeg siger det alligevel: Hvordan kan du elske Amélie, men alligevel finde Hugo syntetisk og "overdreven" og "træt manipulerende"? Du siger, at Amélie og Moulin Rouge har forløsende "følelse af [deres] egen latterlighed", hvor Scorsese betyder, at vi skal tage Hugo alvorligt, og jeg tror ikke, at det er tilfældet, i hvert fald på sidstnævnte punkt. At Scorsese føler en åbenlys passion for filmene er vel derfor, man tolker Hugo som selvoptaget, men for mig er det de følelser, der giver filmen en følelsesmæssig ballast, som Luhrmann og Jeunet-filmene ikke har. Alle tre film gør aggressiv brug af vidundere af CGI-og Scorsese tilføjer 3D til blandingen, til vidunderlig effekt-men hvor du og jeg er forskellige er på spørgsmålet om vægtløshed. Jeg er enig i, at CGI har en distancerende effekt; verdener, der udelukkende består af digital plasticine, er fleksible til det punkt, hvor de nogle gange ikke har nogen tilstedeværelse. Du henviste til Hugo i din "Overrated" post for vores Best Of Film stykke som "en CGI gimcrack" - en perfekt dis ... for en anden film.<br/><br/>Annonce<br/><br/>Det er rimeligt at sige, at Scorsese har bygget Hugo op omkring en standard-udgave, "heartstring-plukning" børnebog / film plot: Forældreløs savner sin far, skaber sin egen lille fantasiverden, gloms på en ny ven, overbeviser en crusty gammel fuddy-duddy at blødgøre op og måske vedtage ham. Men det er bare det narrative skelet, og Scorsese giver masser af kød og blod. For det første kan du ikke se Hugo, den ensomme dreng, kigge ud fra urtårne til en Paris togstation uden at tænke på Scorsese, en anden ensom dreng, der stirrer ud af sit soveværelsesvindue på Elizabeth Street. Og selvom du ikke er en stor nok filmnørd til at lave den forbindelse, føler jeg virkelig, at Hugos rejse ikke er at finde en ny faderfigur, men at fortsætte med den mekaniske magi, der står som hans egen fars arv. Det er, hvad film er: Den vedvarende vision, der giver os mulighed for at acceptere en illusorisk version af verden med 24 billeder i sekundet, er videnskab og magi på én gang. Hugos forhold til Méliés handler ikke om, at han hygger sig med en ny far, men deler en fælles begejstring, den gamle mand har nedsænket i bitterhed. For mig er det en langt mere unik vinkel på en potentielt shopworn forudsætning.<br/><br/>Fandt du virkelig ikke noget af Hugo fortryllende? Selv filmens få kritikere synes villige til at indrømme, at sekvenserne fremkalder biografhistorie og Mélis' studie - med Michael Stuhlbarg som den heroiske filmforsker! - var fantastisk. Det føltes, på den bedst mulige måde, som en berusende komprimering af min History Of Film 101 klasse i college, kondensere et semester værd af klip og kontekst til noget mellem en montage og en animeret pop-up bog. Og det taler til den geniale design af filmen, som lag fakta og fantasi så smukt, at det på én gang er en historie om Méliés og fødslen af biografen, og bare den slags enkle, overdådigt produceret filmisk vidunder, at Scorsese selv ville have elsket som barn. Heldigvis følger Hugo ikke Jeunet/Luhrmann-modellen og har "en følelse af sin egen latterlighed." Som en fantasikender selv, ville du ikke sige, at der er værdi i at spille det lige og alvorligt og uforskammet snarere end at blinke til publikum? Du kan finde Hugo sygelig sød, men jeg tror ikke, at ægtheden af dens følelse skal benægtes.<br/><br/>Annonce<br/><br/>Tasha: Ja, jeg fandt faktisk dele af Hugo fortryllende. (Bemærk, hvordan jeg besvarer dit spørgsmål foran, mens du var for travlt med at skumme med apopleksi til at adressere min, selvom jeg antager, at det er et svar i sig selv. Okay, "påvirkning" kan overdrive sagen - jeg mente bare, at den visuelle stil så meget bekendt ud. Selvom som Keith påpegede, da du bragte dette op i person, er Scorsese hverken imod at trække inspiration fra andres billeder eller immune over for det.) Først og fremmest var jeg fortryllet af de dele, der beskæftiger sig med Georges Mélies 'baghistorie, med hans kærlighed til film, med det arbejde, han lagde i sin kunst og den glæde, han fik ud af det. Der er en frygtelig masse skønhed og sjov i iscenesættelsen af undervandsbanescenen fra Mélies '"Fairyland", og i sekvensen i slutningen med fokus på Mélies optagelser. Jeg indrømmer, at Hugos forbindelse med Méliés over en fælles kærlighed til film er en fin detalje, og jeg nyder en god film om filmskabelse.<br/><br/>Men Hugo handler ikke primært om film, på trods af Méliés tie-ins. Ud over de temaer, du citerer, handler det også om at finde dit formål, som tegnene udtrykkeligt, møjsommeligt forklare hinanden og os. Og det handler om skuespil, og store action setpieces, og jagter, og lykkeligt-ever-after endelser, hvor selv den vrede bølle og genert ældre par og fergawdsakes selv den cranky taxa alle få parret ud med charmerende kærlighed interesser i slutningen. Det handler om, at den superdyrebare Hermione Granger-type er bosset og perky og klog og roser de magiske verdener indkapslet i bøger. Og hele denne forretning er vældig velkendt og vældig kunstig.<br/><br/>Annonce<br/><br/>Ja, Scorsese leger med arketyper. Problemet er, at jeg aldrig følte, at han gennemsyrede dem med noget nyt, frisk eller troværdigt, på trods af sin egen baggrundshistorie. Jeg ville have foretrukket en historie om en ung Scorsese, der voksede op med astma - noget lille og ægte, uden store rum fulde af CGI-urværk og gyldne glødende støv-motes og profetiske drømme og en rasende voksen tyran-vagt med et hjerte af guld - alt det overdimensionerede, over-the-top nonsens. Du citerer Scorseses personlige baggrund og kærlighed til film som bevis på, at han virkelig føler, hvad han lægger på skærmen, men jeg føler ikke hans personlige touch i noget af dette, undtagen de øjeblikke, der udtrykkeligt handler om film. Kernefølelserne er måske ægte, men det gør ikke henrettelsen mindre falsk.<br/><br/>Du siger, at følelsernes ægthed ikke skal benægtes. Jeg tvivler ikke på, om Scorsese personligt følte sig ensom og isoleret som barn, men jeg føler ikke ensomhed og isolation på skærmen - jeg ser en masse overdrevne tegn (Hugo er beskidt og hans tøj er slidt og alle de voksne råber på ham, og han bliver regelmæssigt jagtet af en skræmmende hund!) og store beats, med råben og græd og Spielbergian wonder-emoting. For mig er oprigtighed mere overbevisende og mere personlig, når det er stille og direkte; når nogen råber sine meninger til mig, antager jeg, at han enten er virkelig vred eller bare forsøger at overvælde mine sanser for at holde mig fra at udtrykke min egen mening. Hugo var en lang råb, så vidt jeg var bekymret.<br/><br/>Annonce<br/><br/>Hvorfor fik jeg ikke den følelse af falskhed fra Amélie? Jeg vil helt erkende, at Amélie og Moulin Rouge er både store, manipulerende, kunstige konstruktioner i nøjagtig samme ånd, krævende specifikke følelser med bestemte intervaller, og forsøger at sælge disse følelser med tunge emoting og aggressive soundtrack prodding. Ingen af dem solgte mig virkelig på deres følelser som autentiske menneskelige følelser. Hvad jeg nød i disse to film var konstruktionen - især Amélies berusende, latterlige lister over tilfældige karakteriserende træk og oplevelser for dens cast, og Moulin Rouges musikalske-magpie mashups og recontextualizations. Jeg er ofte solgt på historier, der gør kreative eller ambitiøse ting med struktur, og begge disse film kvalificerer sig, hvor Hugo er en meget mere lineær, standard kid-quest.<br/><br/>Men i sidste ende, for mig, kommer det virkelig ned til en følelse af, at de film er fjollede, mens Hugo er beregnet til at blive taget alvorligt i hvert treacly øjeblik. Du tror ikke, at det er sandt - men du forsvarer samtidig sin integritet med hensyn til dens helt autentiske, rodfæstede-i-Scorseses historiefølelse og fortæller mig, at jeg tager fejl, og han mener ikke, at det skal tages alvorligt. Hvad med filmen, der antyder, at den ikke skal tages for pålydende? Og er det muligt, at dette bare er endnu en Curious Case Of Benjamin Button-lignende situation, hvor jeg finder brugen af børn i big-budget film til at være stort set sappy og melodramatisk, mens du som far finder det omgår din kynisme og går direkte til din familie-følelse?<br/><br/>Annonce<br/><br/>Scott: Jeg er ikke sikker på, at jeg mente, at Scorsese ikke mener at blive taget alvorligt; det er bare, at han har valgt et finurligt køretøj, hvorigennem han kan udtrykke en seriøs kærlighed til filmene. Når du siger, "Men Hugo handler ikke primært om film, på trods af Méli's tie-ins," er jeg mystificeret. Jeg indrømmer, at du finder mange elementer af Hugo alt for velkendte og besværlige og fulde af Spielbergian wonder-emoting - der er intet jeg kan gøre for at argumentere omkring den opfattelse, som andre Hugo tvivlere deler. Nogle gange betyder en film at charmere og fortrylle, og det gør det ikke for nogle; du har Hugo og jeg har Amélie, selvom jeg tror, at sidstnævnte, bevidst kunstigt som det er, betyder for os at finde det romantisk. (I stedet for at sige, nogle forfærdelige mekaniske anordning egnet til en Saw efterfølger.)<br/><br/>Men at sige Hugo handler ikke primært om film? Hvis det ikke handler om film, så er det den mest meningsløse diskursive historie om [hvad du end tror det handler om] jeg nogensinde har set. Forholdet mellem Hugo og Méliés er filmens hjerte, og i hjertet af det er ikke bare en lagerforbindelse mellem Plucky Orphan og Crusty Old Guy With A Heart Of Gold, men en fælles affinitet for manipuleret magi - især filmens magi. Jeg tror Scorsese og hans samarbejdspartnere har fundet en måde at udtrykke deres begejstring over de tidlige dage af filmen gennem en fantasi, der er tilgængelig for alle aldre. Den arketypefyldte børnefortælling er den eneste skorpe her; biograf er tærten. (Mmmm... pie.)<br/><br/>Annonce<br/><br/>Hvad angår The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button, ser jeg ikke meget af en forbindelse, andet end at forsøge at udsætte mig som en Benjamin Button-forsvarer som en måde at skade min troværdighed. (I øvrigt, hvordan er statisterne på den G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra Blu-ray?) Jeg har sagt til dig, at den søvnberøvede nye far i mig måske var sårbar over for Benjamin Button, men jeg kan ikke forestille mig en tid, hvor forudsætningen for aldring i omvendt ikke ville bevæge mig. Hvordan kan du ikke blive påvirket af det?) Og desuden kan jeg ikke se, hvordan Benjamin Button relaterer meget til Hugo som en film om børn, da det bare er et lille segment af en historie, der spænder over en meget større bane.<br/><br/>Så har jeg overbevist dig? Sandsynligvis ikke. Men jeg er glad for at høre, at Hugo ikke var helt blottet for fortryllelser for dig. Sekvenserne på Méli's filmskaberen er det, der satte Hugo over for mig - og i det mindste kan vi dele lidt film kærlighed.<br/><br/>Annonce<br/><br/>Tasha: Nej, jeg kan ikke sige, at du har overbevist mig, lige så lidt som jeg har overbevist dig. Det er umuligt at argumentere nogen ind i en visceral kærlighed til noget, og det burde virkelig være lige så umuligt at tale nogen ned fra visceral kærlighed. For det meste har du ladet mig se Hugo i Scott-O-Vision, hvilket er en interessant oplevelse; i det mindste nu er jeg mildt overbevist om, at vi ikke på en eller anden måde formåede at se helt forskellige film, som begge på en eller anden måde havde samme navn og instruktør.<br/><br/>Vi havde dog helt sikkert forskellige oplevelser, og efter min mening fokuserede vi på forskellige aspekter af produktionen: Jeg ser stadig ikke "filmen er fantastisk" tema som filmens enkeltstreng, så meget som en blandt for mange. "Pointlessly diskursive" næsten dækker det, selvom jeg ville smide i "ofte unødvendigt cutesy og dyrebare" oven på det. Mens du er fokuseret på filmens velsmagende tærtefyldning, føler jeg, at tærten var dækket af et pund krystalliseret sukker, og jeg tror, det gør en forskel, uanset filmens kernebudskab eller en håndfuld fantastiske scener. Se også Benjamin Button, som jeg ikke bragte op bare for at gnave dig - jeg tror virkelig, du har mere af en sentimental streak end jeg gør med hensyn til børn i biografen, især når de bruges mere som symboler på sårbarhed og uskyld end som menneskelige karakterer. Hey, du ved, hvilken film helt ikke har søde bredøjede moppets bringe håb til en kynisk verden? G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra. Måske vil jeg gå se disse Blu-ray ekstramateriale. Jeg kunne bruge nogle eksplosionsinsulin til at kompensere for Hugos sødme. |
| "I hoped my daughter would be free from difficult and troubling times": Mee Mee's story as a refugee Mom<br/><br/>Hope in Times of Crisis: A Mother's Day Story<br/><br/>By Judith Santiago*<br/><br/>Mee Mee heard that the soldiers were coming. She took hold of her son and frantically joined the rest of the villagers who were running toward the Thai-Burmese border, where the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) was located. Her husband was in another village running in the opposite direction, Mee later learned. After the soldiers' pursuit ended, Mee returned home to her small village in Koechi, Burma.<br/><br/>During 1997-2000, Mee and thousands like her lived under the constant threat of violence from Burmese soldiers. Many people would take temporary refuge in the jungle, and return home to their village after soldiers left the area, just to do it all over again days later. About once a week, Mee and others would be on the move to avoid capture, rape, or death by soldiers.<br/><br/>During one incident, Mee's husband ran ahead of his wife to secure food for his family. Her husband was spotted by soldiers and shot. The bullet shattered a portion of his ribcage, leaving him severely wounded and in distress as he journeyed toward the jungle with his family for safety.<br/><br/>For three months, Mee's husband hid and moved the family with an exasperating wound at his side. He received no medical care, except for Mee's tending.<br/><br/>"I was afraid to return to Burma," Mee said through an interpreter. "I feared dying. I cried and cried every day," she continued.<br/><br/>Mee's husband eventually drew enough strength to walk five days toward a small village in Thailand where they learned the location of a hospital and a refugee camp. When Mee and her husband finally arrived at the hospital, he underwent immediate surgery and later recovered.<br/><br/>Symbol of Hope<br/><br/>Life in the jungle for those fleeing Burmese soldiers was indeed terrifying and difficult. Makeshift bamboo tents with only roof and floor coverings became suitable temporary dwellings. Many women including Mee gave birth to children in the jungle. Mee's then six-year-old son assisted in the delivery of his sister named Eh Ku Hser. Her name means love – cold – sweet. "Cold" in Burmese culture means so as to not pass through the fire of life, as heat represents troubled times.<br/><br/>"I hoped my daughter would be free from difficult and troubling times," said Mee. "I did not want her to go through what I had experienced," she continued.<br/><br/>For Mee, the birth of her daughter in the midst of darkness, torment and fear, was a symbol of hope for a new life to come. Hope in times of crisis, the very premise of the United Methodist Committee on Relief's (UMCOR) newly co-branded UMCOR-Prosperity Candle, is also the essence of that which candles shed light upon.<br/><br/>A New Beginning<br/><br/>With the help of UNHCR, hope for a new life did indeed materialize for Mee and her family when they resettled in West Springfield, Massachusetts. There, Mee met Moo Kho Paw, another woman who emigrated from Burma, and who was working at Prosperity Candle in Florence. The organization helps refugee women who have escaped areas of conflict rebuild their lives through the art of candle making. Moo Kho recommended that Mee join the organization, and Mee gladly accepted.<br/><br/>"I was excited to be out of the house," said Mee, "I was raised to believe that because I was a woman, my role was to remain at home and raise my family," she continued. "While many Burmese women want to do more for themselves, they are often encouraged to remain homemakers."<br/><br/>Today, Mee has plans to go into the candle-making business for herself and support her five children, but she expressed the need to learn English first.<br/><br/>"In the Thai refugee camp, we had education, but it was not so good," said Mee. "When I was a child, I wanted to go to school, but I was told to stay home because I was a woman. Now, I have hopes for my daughters to go to college and become doctors or policewomen," continued Mee.<br/><br/>Mee has struck an even balance in her life that she wishes others would have found—a simple, happy life where work, caring for family members and freedom of choice all have their place.<br/><br/>Support Refugee Women in the US<br/><br/>Share this Mother's Day story with your loved ones. And, when you purchase handmade candles by Mee, Moo Kho, and Naw, another Burmese refugee woman working at Prosperity Candle , know you are helping to support their livelihood as they rebuild their lives and those of their family members in the US. | "Jeg håbede, at min datter ville være fri for vanskelige og foruroligende tider": Mee Mees historie som flygtningemor<br/><br/>Håb i krisetider: En mors dag historie<br/><br/>af Judith Santiago<br/><br/>Mee Mee hørte, at soldaterne var på vej. Hun tog fat i sin søn og sluttede sig febrilsk til resten af landsbyboerne, der løb mod den thai-burmesiske grænse, hvor FN's Flygtningehøjkommissariat (UNHCR) var placeret. Hendes mand var i en anden landsby kører i den modsatte retning, Mee senere lært. Efter soldaternes forfølgelse sluttede, Mee vendte hjem til sin lille landsby i Koechi, Burma.<br/><br/>I løbet af 1997-2000 levede Mee og tusinder som hende under konstant trussel om vold fra burmesiske soldater. Mange mennesker ville tage midlertidigt tilflugt i junglen, og vende hjem til deres landsby efter soldater forlod området, bare for at gøre det hele igen dage senere. Omkring en gang om ugen ville Mee og andre være på farten for at undgå tilfangetagelse, voldtægt eller død af soldater.<br/><br/>Under en hændelse løb Mees mand foran sin kone for at sikre mad til sin familie. Hendes mand blev spottet af soldater og skudt. Kuglen smadrede en del af hans ribben og efterlod ham alvorligt såret og i nød, da han rejste mod junglen med sin familie for sikkerhed.<br/><br/>I tre måneder gemte Mees mand sig og flyttede familien med et irriterende sår ved sin side. Han modtog ingen lægehjælp, bortset fra Mees pleje.<br/><br/>"Jeg var bange for at vende tilbage til Burma," sagde Mee gennem en tolk. "Jeg frygtede at dø. Jeg græd og græd hver dag," fortsatte hun.<br/><br/>Mees mand fik til sidst nok styrke til at gå fem dage mod en lille landsby i Thailand, hvor de lærte placeringen af et hospital og en flygtningelejr. Da Mee og hendes mand endelig ankom til hospitalet, gennemgik han øjeblikkelig operation og kom sig senere.<br/><br/>Symbol på håb<br/><br/>Livet i junglen for de flygtende burmesiske soldater var virkelig skræmmende og vanskeligt. Midlertidige bambustelt med kun tag og gulvbelægning blev egnede midlertidige boliger. Mange kvinder, herunder Mee, fødte børn i junglen. Mees dengang seksårige søn assisterede ved fødslen af sin søster ved navn Eh Ku Hser. Hendes navn betyder kærlighed – kold – sød. "Kold" i burmesisk kultur betyder for ikke at passere gennem livets ild, da varme repræsenterer urolige tider.<br/><br/>"Jeg håbede, at min datter ville være fri for vanskelige og foruroligende tider," sagde Mee. "Jeg ville ikke have, at hun skulle gå igennem, hvad jeg havde oplevet," fortsatte hun.<br/><br/>For Mee, hendes datters fødsel midt i mørke, pine og frygt, var et symbol på håb for et nyt liv, der skulle komme. Håb i krisetider, selve forudsætningen for United Methodist Committee on Reliefs (UMCOR) nyligt co-brandede UMCOR-Velstandstearinlys, er også essensen af det, som stearinlys kaster lys over.<br/><br/>En ny begyndelse<br/><br/>Med hjælp fra UNHCR blev håbet om et nyt liv virkelig til virkelighed for Mee og hendes familie, da de flyttede til West Springfield, Massachusetts. Der mødte Mee Moo Kho Paw, en anden kvinde, der emigrerede fra Burma, og som arbejdede på Prosperity Candle i Firenze. Organisationen hjælper flygtningekvinder, der er undsluppet konfliktområder, med at genopbygge deres liv gennem kunsten at lave stearinlys. Moo Kho anbefalede, at Mee meldte sig ind i organisationen, og Mee tog med glæde imod.<br/><br/>"Jeg var begejstret for at være ude af huset," sagde Mee, "jeg blev opdraget til at tro, at fordi jeg var en kvinde, var min rolle at forblive hjemme og hæve min familie," fortsatte hun. "Mens mange burmesiske kvinder ønsker at gøre mere for sig selv, opfordres de ofte til at forblive hjemmegående."<br/><br/>I dag har Mee planer om at gå ind i stearinlysfremstillingsbranchen for sig selv og støtte sine fem børn, men hun udtrykte behovet for at lære engelsk først.<br/><br/>"I den thailandske flygtningelejr havde vi uddannelse, men det var ikke så godt," sagde Mee. "Da jeg var barn, ville jeg i skole, men jeg fik at vide, at jeg skulle blive hjemme, fordi jeg var kvinde. Nu har jeg håb om, at mine døtre går på college og bliver læger eller politikvinder," fortsatte Mee.<br/><br/>Mee har fundet en ligevægt i sit liv, som hun ønsker andre ville have fundet - et simpelt, lykkeligt liv, hvor arbejde, omsorg for familiemedlemmer og valgfrihed alle har deres plads.<br/><br/>Hjælp flygtninge i USA<br/><br/>Del denne mors dag historie med dine kære.

| The Precedency Essay<br/><br/>1562 words - 7 pages<br/><br/>Affirmative action is a government policy that gives opportunities to minorities, women, and any group who has been the victim of discrimination in the past. Affirmative action is the outcome of the 1960's Civil Rights movement, growing out of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 which outlawed discrimination based on race, ethnicity, or gender. It was the 1978 Supreme Court decision, The Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, which allowed for the use of race-based preferences as a means of fostering diversity, allowing affirmative action to be used in admissions policies. It was created with the intention to provide equal opportunities for members of minority groups in education and ...view middle of the document...<br/><br/>However, according to a 2007 report by the Pew Research Center, support for affirmative action among the American public has actually increased substantiallyin recent years, climbing from 58% in 1995 to 70% in 2007. Supporters of affirmative action make many arguments in support of affirmative action, in the hopes of getting others to see the genuine good that affirmative actin policies bring to our society. Supporters believe that affirmative action is more of a process rather than an admissions policy. Colleges and universities take the extra initiative to reach out to minority groups, encouraging them to apply. Colleges and universities offer additional financial aid and provide on-campus resources to help better the student's college education. Supporters also note the rising number of minority applications to colleges and universities due in part to affirmative action policies.<br/>Statistics have proven that when affirmative action is eliminated, such as when it was at Berkley College and UCLA in 1998, the minority student admissions fell 61 percent and 36 percent respectively, proving that affirmative action plays a major role in a minority students college admissions process. Affirmative action supporters also believe that diversity in higher education provides a better educational atmosphere for all students, personally and intellectually. If affirmative action were to be eliminated, there would be fewer minority students enrolled in colleges, causing diversity to be fairly slim. Affirmative action policies are also necessary in order to compensate for centuries of racial, economic, and social oppression. Individuals with a higher socioeconomic status have more opportunities than those of lower socioeconomic backgrounds. Supporters believe that certain racial or ethnic groups are disadvantaged because they are frequently in lower income households and consequently are not exposed to the same resources as students from higher socioeconomic classes. Advocates support the notion of competition between students based on merit, but argue that affirmative action compensates for economic differences. College graduates, who have benefitted from affirmative action, have also said that they received better jobs, earned more money, and overall live better lives because of the fortunate opportunities they received through affirmative action.<br/>Supporters of affirmative action continuously stress the severe importance of affirmative action, considering its contributions to enhancing both the college experience and society in general. However, opponents of affirmative action believe that the time has come to end affirmative action. Opponents believe affirmative action was created to ensure fair admission practices to bring change to a long period of racial discrimination. They believe the policy is outdated."It's time to pull the plug on race-based decision making," says Ward Connerly, a Sacramento, California businessman and lead organizer of...<br/><br/>Find Another Essay On The Precedency<br/><br/>754 words - 4 pages<br/>of the burden to continue prospering.

Bekræftende handling er resultatet af 1960'ernes borgerrettighedsbevægelse, der voksede ud af Civil Rights Act of 1964, som forbød diskrimination baseret på race, etnicitet eller køn. Det var 1978 Højesterets afgørelse, The Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, som tillod brugen af race-baserede præferencer som et middel til at fremme mangfoldighed, så bekræftende handling, der skal anvendes i indlæggelser politikker. Det blev oprettet med det formål at give lige muligheder for medlemmer af minoritetsgrupper i uddannelse og ...<br/><br/>Ifølge en rapport fra 2007 fra Pew Research Center er støtten til positiv særbehandling blandt den amerikanske offentlighed faktisk steget betydeligt i de senere år, idet den er steget fra 58 % i 1995 til 70 % i 2007. Tilhængere af bekræftende handling gør mange argumenter til støtte for bekræftende handling, i håb om at få andre til at se det ægte gode, som bekræftende aktinpolitikker bringer til vores samfund. Tilhængere mener, at bekræftende handling er mere af en proces end en indlæggelsespolitik. Kollegier og universiteter tager det ekstra initiativ til at nå ud til minoritetsgrupper og tilskynder dem til at anvende. Kollegier og universiteter tilbyde yderligere økonomisk støtte og give on-campus ressourcer til at hjælpe bedre den studerendes college uddannelse. Tilhængere bemærker også det stigende antal minoritetsansøgninger til gymnasier og universiteter på grund af delvis bekræftende handlingspolitikker.<br/>Statistikker har vist, at når bekræftende handling er elimineret, såsom da det var på Berkley College og UCLA i 1998, faldt minoritetsstuderendes indlæggelser henholdsvis 61 procent og 36 procent, hvilket beviser, at bekræftende handling spiller en stor rolle i en minoritetsstuderendes optagelsesproces. Bekræftende handling tilhængere mener også, at mangfoldigheden i de videregående uddannelser giver en bedre uddannelsesmæssig atmosfære for alle studerende, personligt og intellektuelt. Hvis bekræftende handling skulle elimineres, ville der være færre minoritetsstuderende indskrevet på gymnasier, hvilket forårsager mangfoldighed at være temmelig slank. Bekræftende handlingspolitikker er også nødvendige for at kompensere for århundreders racemæssig, økonomisk og social undertrykkelse. Personer med en højere socioøkonomisk status har flere muligheder end dem med lavere socioøkonomisk baggrund. Tilhængere mener, at visse racemæssige eller etniske grupper er dårligt stillede, fordi de ofte er i husstande med lavere indkomst og derfor ikke udsættes for de samme ressourcer som studerende fra højere socioøkonomiske klasser. Fortalere støtter begrebet konkurrence mellem studerende baseret på merit, men hævder, at bekræftende handling kompenserer for økonomiske forskelle. College kandidater, der har nydt godt af bekræftende handling, har også sagt, at de fik bedre job, tjente flere penge og generelt leve bedre liv på grund af de heldige muligheder, de modtog gennem bekræftende handling.<br/>Tilhængere af bekræftende handling understreger løbende den alvorlige betydning af bekræftende handling, i betragtning af dens bidrag til at forbedre både college erfaring og samfundet generelt. Modstandere af bekræftende handling mener imidlertid, at tiden er kommet til at afslutte bekræftende handling. Modstandere mener, at bekræftende handling blev skabt for at sikre retfærdig adgangspraksis for at bringe forandring til en lang periode med racediskrimination. De mener, at politikken er forældet."

| Combinations<br/><br/>Combinations Are defenses against a punch, choreographed responses to different types of attacks. They have many names across the martial arts but (in my experience) every art has a version of them. This makes them different than forms because there are plenty of martial arts that have no forms. What makes there partner exercises so universal? Why practice a specific response when (in reality) timing, type of attack, size of the attacker, and a hundred other factors will make it so you never use that entire choreographed response? And finally, how can we practice for a real defense situation and avoid injury at the same time?<br/><br/>The universality of combinations is impressive, to say the least. Our style of Kenpo karate has a list of 108 combos that can be learned. (Most students only learn 20-30 though) In Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu you spend whole classes practicing arm bars and chokes, learning every subtlety to the move while your partner offers little to no resistance. Every boxer has spent hours in front of the bag and/or mirror throwing the same combination of punches until their body moves by reflex alone. Combinations are universal because we have no better way to introduce movement and then practice the subtle positions required to make them work. Hitting a small pressure point through clothing takes A LOT of practice, catching an arm bar with control requires a carefully placed hip and a sneaky setup, and a great combination is only useful if you can through it from a balanced and protected position. Can you think of a better way to gain these skills?<br/><br/>There is any number of factors that determine how you respond to an attack and whether in a sparring match or in a fight, I have NEVER used a full combination in my defense. Why, then, do we spend hours practicing them? We practice these choreographed responses because the objective is not to pull combination 8 out every time you see a hook punch but to show you one way of blocking it and then a possible way to follow it up. I have never chosen to use combination 3 in a reality situation but the block is one of my go-to moves. Combinations add tools to the toolbox they do not fix the car.<br/><br/>The last question is a question of safety. If we practice for the sake of reality we need to replicate reality. How do we prevent injury while doing so? When it comes down to it, it's about building trust. We start slow and learn to trust that we have control over ourselves. We learn to trust our partners have control as well. In more time we learn to trust our control over our partner and (a little scarier) we learn to trust our partner's control over us. In the end (with a lot of practice) you can move are full speed, tossing your partner, and being thrown without fear of injury.<br/><br/>Combinations are universal for a reason; they are practiced so they can be dissected into their parts, and we stay safe by starting slow and building trust. As with everything else in the martial arts, combinations have many reasons behind their practice and execution. | Kombinationer<br/><br/>Kombinationer Er forsvar mod et slag, koreograferede reaktioner på forskellige typer angreb. De har mange navne på tværs af kampsport, men (efter min erfaring) har hver kunst en version af dem. Dette gør dem anderledes end former, fordi der er masser af kampsport, der ikke har nogen former. Hvad gør der partner øvelser så universel? Hvorfor praktisere et specifikt svar, når (i virkeligheden) timing, type angreb, størrelsen af angriberen og hundrede andre faktorer vil gøre det, så du aldrig bruger hele det koreograferede svar? Og endelig, hvordan kan vi øve for en reel forsvarssituation og undgå skade på samme tid?<br/><br/>Kombinationernes universalitet er imponerende, for at sige det mildt. Vores stil af Kenpo karate har en liste over 108 kombinationer, der kan læres. (De fleste studerende lærer kun 20-30 selv) I brasiliansk Jiu-Jitsu du tilbringer hele klasser praktisere arm barer og chokes, lære hver subtilitet til at flytte, mens din partner tilbyder lidt at ingen modstand. Hver bokser har brugt timer foran posen og / eller spejl kaste den samme kombination af slag, indtil deres krop bevæger sig ved refleks alene. Kombinationer er universelle, fordi vi ikke har nogen bedre måde at introducere bevægelse og derefter øve de subtile positioner, der kræves for at få dem til at fungere. At ramme et lille trykpunkt gennem tøj tager meget øvelse, at fange en armbar med kontrol kræver en omhyggeligt placeret hofte og en lusket opsætning, og en god kombination er kun nyttig, hvis du kan gennem den fra en afbalanceret og beskyttet position. Kan du tænke på en bedre måde at få disse færdigheder på?<br/><br/>Der er en række faktorer, der bestemmer, hvordan du reagerer på et angreb, og om det er i en sparringskamp eller i en kamp, har jeg ALDRIG brugt en fuld kombination til mit forsvar. Hvorfor bruger vi så timer på at øve dem? Vi praktiserer disse koreograferede svar, fordi målet ikke er at trække kombination 8 ud hver gang du ser en krog slag, men at vise dig en måde at blokere det og derefter en mulig måde at følge det op. Jeg har aldrig valgt at bruge kombination 3 i en virkelighedssituation, men blokken er en af mine go-to-bevægelser. Kombinationer tilføjer værktøjer til værktøjskassen, de reparerer ikke bilen.<br/><br/>Det sidste spørgsmål er et spørgsmål om sikkerhed. Hvis vi praktiserer for virkelighedens skyld, skal vi replikere virkeligheden. Hvordan forhindrer vi skade, mens vi gør det? Når det kommer til det, handler det om at opbygge tillid. Vi begynder langsomt og lærer at stole på, at vi har kontrol over os selv. Vi lærer også at stole på, at vores partnere har kontrol. I mere tid lærer vi at stole på vores kontrol over vores partner, og (lidt mere skræmmende) lærer vi at stole på vores partners kontrol over os. I sidste ende (med en masse øvelse) kan du flytte er fuld fart, kaste din partner, og bliver kastet uden frygt for skade.<br/><br/>Kombinationer er universelle af en grund; de praktiseres, så de kan dissekeres i deres dele, og vi forbliver sikre ved at starte langsomt og opbygge tillid. Som med alt andet i kampsport, kombinationer har mange grunde bag deres praksis og udførelse. |
