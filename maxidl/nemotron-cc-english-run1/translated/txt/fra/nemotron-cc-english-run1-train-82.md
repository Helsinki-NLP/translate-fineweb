In simple terms, the condition is characterized by: one develops a kidney disease and undergoes a kidney transplant and other diseases associated with acidic concentration in the blood and gout. In theory, the condition will occur even if the genetic change is inherited from one parent and sporadically occurs when there is no family history.<br/><br/>Common names of autosomal dominant interstitial kidney disease<br/><br/>The condition has other names as well namely: medullary cystic kidney disease, although this name is not used as much because most people suffering from this condition do not have medullary cysts. It is also referred to as juvenile hyperuricemic nephropathy. The disease tends to affect people of ages 20 to 50. The latter condition as aforementioned occurs in young children, something, which translate to get it from both parents.<br/>Cystic kidney disease is an inherited condition whereby the cysts in the centre of each kidney gradually lose their ability to function properly. Cysts refer to abnormal blisters of fluid in the kidney. The condition further scares the kidney making unable to concentrate the urine and as a result, producing too much urine. Its symptoms include excessive urination, salt cravings, weakness, confusion, bleeding, fatigue, frequent hiccups, low blood pressure, nausea and vomiting, headaches, pale skin, reduced sensation in the hands, weight loss among many others. Other complications include: anemia, ulcers, loss of bone density, infertility and other heart related problems.<br/>Its analysis incorporates blood tests to check for sodium levels and general kidney functions, urine tests to check the levels of concentration and other imbalances, x rays to check for the size of kidneys that may be altered owing to increased urine concentrations, renal biopsy and genetic testing to verify any genetic changes that might have taken place in due time.<br/>While the disease does not have a cut and dry treatment to it, one may focus on controlling measures, which include intake of fluids and salt to supplement the one lost as the disease progresses into latter stages. This also helps reduce dehydration. Other treatments include taking of prescribed medication and diet changes and minimal intakes of foods containing phosphorous and potassium. Further complications may also require one to have a kidney transplant. Basically, this is not a curable disease but rather a manageable once detected in the early stages.<br/><br/>The common yet different factor of Autosomal dominant interstitial kidney disease<br/><br/>Nephronophthisis and medullary cystic kidney disease are mainly grouped together because, in essence, they share the same features but with a slight difference in regards inheritance patterns to the former affecting children and the latter affecting young adults and older age groups. Similar features for both are ADH resistant urine concentration that leads to polyuria and polydipsia, anemia and renal diseases.<br/>The former aforementioned condition is Autosomal recessive accounting to 15% of chronic diseases and causes ESRD during early childhood while the latter is Autosomal dominant with a few sporadic new mutations and causes ESRD for people between the ages of 30 and 50. | En ligne CPR Certification Blog<br/><br/>Date: 23 juillet 2014<br/><br/>La maladie rénale interstitielle autosomique dominante est une collection rare de maladies affectant les fonctions rénales connues. En termes simples, la condition est caractérisée par: on développe une maladie rénale et subit une greffe de rein et d'autres maladies associées à la concentration acide dans le sang et la goutte. En théorie, la condition se produira même si le changement génétique est hérité d'un parent et se produit sporadiquement quand il n'y a pas d'antécédents familiaux.<br/><br/>Noms communs de maladie rénale interstitielle autosomique dominante<br/><br/>La condition a d'autres noms à savoir: maladie rénale kystique médullaire, bien que ce nom ne soit pas utilisé autant parce que la plupart des personnes souffrant de cette condition n'ont pas de kystes médullaires. Il est également appelé néphropathie hyperuricémique juvénile. La maladie a tendance à affecter les personnes âgées de 20 à 50 ans. Cette dernière condition comme mentionné ci-dessus se produit chez les jeunes enfants, quelque chose qui se traduit par l'obtenir des deux parents.<br/>La maladie du rein kystique est une maladie héréditaire par laquelle les kystes au centre de chaque rein perdent progressivement leur capacité à fonctionner correctement. Les kystes se réfèrent à des cloques anormales de liquide dans le rein. La condition fait encore peur au rein rendant incapable de concentrer l'urine et, par conséquent, produisant trop d'urine. Ses symptômes comprennent une miction excessive, des envies de sel, une faiblesse, une confusion, des saignements, de la fatigue, des hoquets fréquents, une pression artérielle basse, des nausées et des vomissements, des maux de tête, une peau pâle, une sensation réduite dans les mains, une perte de poids parmi beaucoup d'autres. Les autres complications comprennent: l'anémie, les ulcères, la perte de densité osseuse, l'infertilité et d'autres problèmes cardiaques.<br/>Son analyse comprend des tests sanguins pour vérifier les niveaux de sodium et les fonctions rénales générales, des tests d'urine pour vérifier les niveaux de concentration et d'autres déséquilibres, des rayons X pour vérifier la taille des reins qui peuvent être modifiés en raison de l'augmentation des concentrations d'urine, une biopsie rénale et des tests génétiques pour vérifier tout changement génétique qui aurait pu avoir lieu en temps voulu.<br/>Bien que la maladie n’ait pas de traitement sec et de coupe, on peut se concentrer sur les mesures de contrôle, qui comprennent la consommation de liquides et de sel pour compléter celle perdue au fur et à mesure que la maladie progresse dans les derniers stades. D'autres traitements comprennent la prise de médicaments prescrits et les changements de régime alimentaire et les apports minimes d'aliments contenant du phosphore et du potassium. Fondamentalement, ce n'est pas une maladie curable, mais plutôt une maladie gérable une fois détectée dans les premiers stades.<br/><br/>Le facteur commun mais différent de la maladie rénale interstitielle autosomique dominante<br/><br/>La néphronophtise et la maladie médullaire du rein kystique sont principalement regroupées parce que, en substance, elles partagent les mêmes caractéristiques, mais avec une légère différence en ce qui concerne les modes d'hérédité chez les enfants et les jeunes adultes et les groupes d'âge plus âgés. Des caractéristiques similaires pour les deux sont la concentration d'urine résistante à l'ADH qui conduit à la polyurie et à la polydipsie, à l'anémie et aux maladies rénales.<br/>La première condition susmentionnée est autosomique récessive compte à 15% des maladies chroniques et provoque ESRD pendant la petite enfance, tandis que le dernier est autosomique dominante avec quelques nouvelles mutations sporadiques et provoque ESRD pour les personnes âgées de 30 à 50. |
| Hobbes' vs. Locke's Account on the State of Nature<br/><br/>Topic: PhilosophyWords: 2539Pages: 9Aug 3rd, 2021<br/><br/>Hobbes and Locke are among the most influential political philosophers to ever write in English. The state of nature, which precedes the organization of the complex societies, is the common premise that both Hobbes and Locke share but interpret in different ways. The former views humans in their natural state as equally dangerous and free to pursue their egoistic goals unrestricted by the nonexistent notions of justice, which is why his natural state amounts to the "war of every man against every man" (Hobbes76). The latter, on the other hand, views humans in their original condition as equally valuable and restricts natural freedom by the idea of justice that requires not to harm others, which allows defining the state of nature as "mutual assistance and preservation" rather than war (Locke 15). The key difference between the two philosophers' accounts of natural state is that Locke uses ethical considerations while Hobbes does not, and it ultimately leads Hobbes to envisage a state exercising unlimited power over human beings, while Locke limits the government by the moral principles, which he considers a natural law.<br/><br/>Hobbes bases his assumptions regarding the state of nature on the fact that all people are roughly equal in their physical and mental capabilities. He admits that some individuals may demonstrate greater physical strength or superior intellect but insists that "when all is reckoned together, the difference between man and man is not so considerable" (Hobbes 74). Since humans are roughly equal in their capabilities, they also have similar hopes to attain their ends and satisfy their needs (Hobbes 75). As a logical outcome of this equality, when the people begin competing for scarce resources, no one may feel entirely secure in his or her possessions. Even if a mighty, cunning, and capable person succeeds in subjugating "the persons of all men he can," it still does not guarantee the ultimate security (Hobbes 75). As no human can obtain such superiority over the others that renders him or her utterly immune to their strength of intellect, no human can feel completely safe when surrounded by his or her equals. Hobbes' equality in the natural state is equality of fear, where all humans view each other as dangerous competitors.<br/><br/>Just as Hobbes, Locke considers all human beings to be fundamentally equal, but assigns a very different meaning to the term. From his perspective, it is not the equality of capabilities, but, rather, the equality of value. He opines that the people "promiscuously born to all the same advantages of nature" should logically enjoy the perfect equality among them, as there is no reason to consider anyone inherently more valuable (Locke 8). The only possible foundation for designating some people as superior to others would be if God "by any manifest declaration of his will, set one above another" (Locke 8). Since such divine sanction of superiority is absent, Locke concludes that the natural equality of all representatives of humankind is not to be called into question. Hobbes approaches equality pragmatically and stresses that people in their natural state are equally dangerous, but Locke employs an ethical approach and emphasizes that humans are equally valuable in God's eyes. This disagreement is but the first difference between the two authors based on the fact that Locke includes God as a premise into his political philosophy, while Hobbes does not.<br/><br/>Another characteristic feature of Hobbes' account of the natural state is his interpretation of liberty. According to Hobbes, the state of nature implies unlimited freedom to do whatever is necessary for one's continued existence. The philosopher defines liberty as "the absence of external impediments" in using one's abilities to attain one's goals (Hobbes 79). The primary purpose of every sentient being is to maintain its continued existence. As a consequence, Hobbesian freedom amounts to the unhindered opportunity to do anything that, in one's judgment, would be best suited to preserve one's life and possessions (Hobbes 79). The only limitation to liberty is that a person cannot do anything contradictory to sustaining his or her life or destroying "the means of preserving the same" (Hobbes 79). Apart from that, there are no boundaries, and everyone has "a right to everything, even to one another's body" if that furthers one's survival (Hobbes 80). Thus, natural liberty, as viewed by Hobbes, is the absence of externally enforced obstacles in pursuing one's right to everything to sustain and secure one's continued existence.<br/><br/>Locke also upholds the idea of natural liberty but, unsurprisingly, approaches it in a manner that is significantly different from that of Hobbes. As soon as he begins discussing liberty in the state of nature, he immediately notes that a state of freedom does not equate "a state of license" (Locke 9). The philosopher identifies two specific limitations to human freedom in the state of nature. The first one is identical to that introduce by Hobbes: however free and independent, a person nevertheless "has not liberty to destroy himself" (Locke 9). Yet the second limitation contradicts Hobbes' prepositions directly. According to Locke, every human being has a natural obligation not to "harm another in his life, health, liberty, or possessions" (9). Just as with his interpretation of equality, the author bases this assertion on ethical and religious grounds: people should preserve each other's existence since they are all creations of the same "omnipotent, and infinitely wise maker" (Locke 9). Thus, Locke's limits liberty in the natural state far more stringently than Hobbes by introducing the obligation to refrain from harming both oneself and the others.<br/><br/>The differences between the two authors also manifest in their accounts of justice in the natural state of humanity. As far as Hobbes is concerned, delineating just and unjust practices is merely the matter of the law. There is no jurisprudence in the state of nature, and the only law governing human beings in their original condition is a natural law that only obliges them to seek personal security. As a result, nothing can be unjust in the original state of the humankind: "notions of right and wrong justice and injustice" have no place and no meaning in the absence of the stringently enforced law (Hobbes 78). As long as the people use their virtually unlimited freedom to ruthlessly compete with each other for resources, to which they are equally entitled, they have no criteria to differentiate between just and unjust actions. Therefore, the Hobbesian state of nature defies the very idea of justice since the author interprets it as a mere function of the formalized and established law.<br/><br/>Locke assigns different meaning to justice and views it not so much in legislative as in the ethical terms. This paper already mentioned that, unlike Hobbes, Locke employs ethical notions and generally bases his political philosophy on moral rather than purely practical presumptions. Locke's natural law, unlike that of Hobbes, obliges human beings to take care of each other rather than simply leaving everyone to fend for themselves. As a result, there is a place for justice and injustice in his state of nature. The author points to this fact himself when noting that no one should deprive another of his or her life of the means of preserving it "unless it be to do justice on an offender" (Locke 9). This statement reveals with the utmost clarity that, according to Locke, there is justice in the state of nature, and, moreover, humans have to preserve it actively. The criterion of justice, which Hobbes' natural state lacks, is the second limitation on natural liberty imposed by Locke: an action is unjust if it constitutes an unwarranted threat to another person's life and possessions.<br/><br/>These differences in the two authors' treatment of equality, liberty, and justice or injustice culminate in their interpretation of the relationship between the state of nature and the state of war. From Hobbes's perspective, the two are synonymous, because the ruthless competition is the only logical outcome of putting people with equivalent capabilities and similar needs in an environment with limited resources. He states this connection outright: "if any two men desire the same thing, which nevertheless they cannot both enjoy, they become enemies" and are, therefore, in the state of war with each other (Hobbes 75). Yet since humans are numerous and all possess similar capabilities and needs, this competition manifests not only in the individual interactions but also on the level of humanity as a whole. As long as all humans have equal and unlimited rights to all resources and even to each other's bodies and lives, the state of nature is a war of "every man against every man" (Hobbes 76). This grim interpretation stems directly from Hobbes' portrayal of the state of nature as governed solely by the individuals' egoistic urges.<br/><br/>Locke, on the other hand, differentiates between the state of nature and the state of war and points out that, while they may occur simultaneously, it is no reason to identify one with the other. Locke's definition of the state of war is virtually identical to that offered by Hobbes. According to Locke, "he who attempts to get another man into his absolute power does thereby put himself into a state of war with him" (14). This explanation lines up perfectly with the Hobbesian notion that everyone's universal right to everything, including the other people's bodies and lives, leads to the state of war. Yet Locke refuses to equate the state of war and the state of nature precisely because he denies Hobbes' interpretation of natural freedom. Since Locke's natural state restrains people from harming each other through the second limitation of liberty, an attempt on another person's freedom is a transgression against the natural law. While for Hobbes, war is the humankind's condition by default, Locke portrays it as a perversion of the state of nature rather than its rule.<br/><br/>These differences in delineating the state on nature and its constituents, such as liberty, equality, justice, and war, pave the way to the authors contrasting portrayals of government. Based on his pessimistic assessment of the state of nature, the author of Leviathan concludes that, under conditions of war, there can be no definite hope for "living out the time which nature ordinarily alloweth men to live" (Hobbes 80). The solution is laying down the universal right to everything and leaving everyone "so much liberty against other men, as he would allow other men against himself" (Hobbes 80). The participants of the resulting social contract invest the unlimited liberties they have surrendered into a sovereign – the bearer of the supreme power whose purpose is to preserve the achieved status quo by punishing all transgressions against it. Sovereign's power is absolute: the ruler has the authority "to do whatsoever he shall think necessary" to promote peace between his subjects so that no one would assail another's life or property (113). Hobbes concludes that without such an unassailable figure entitled with the right to do anything to the subjects, there can be no peace and no guarantee of security.<br/><br/>While Locke agrees with the necessity of creating politically organized societies, he nevertheless opposes Hobbes' idea of the sovereign power as unlimited and unassailable. As mentioned above, Locke's state of nature is not nearly as dreadful as that painted by Hobbes because of the people's obligation to preserve not only themselves but each other as well. Therefore, the need for social contract arises not from the fear of the others, but from the sheer convenience. Small communities may not need numerous laws to solve conflicts and "officers to superintend the process," but larger associations find it advisable to institute governments for that purpose (Locke 57). Yet the power of the government cannot be unlimited because it would result in subduing the subjects to an "inconstant, uncertain, unknown, arbitrary will of another man" (Locke 17). Such a government would constitute a twofold violation of the natural law. By agreeing to another person's absolute power over his life, a subject would violate its first limitation prohibiting to harm oneself. As for the ruler, destroying another person's liberty would constitute direct harm and, as such, be contradictory to the second limitation.<br/><br/>As a direct continuation of his case for unlimited governmental authority, Hobbes denies the separation of powers as a principle. From his perspective, the sovereign, once instituted, possesses "the whole power of prescribing the rules" governing the lives of the subjects or, in shorter terms, the legislative power (Hobbes 114). The sovereign also reserves the right of "hearing and deciding all controversies" – that is, the judicial power (Hobbes 114). Finally, since the entire purpose of the sovereign is to force the subjects to refrain from harming each other, there can be no doubt that executive power is also his or her exclusive prerogative. The separation of powers as a concept is alien to Hobbes because of his views on the state of nature. Creating a political entity where the executive, legislative, and judicial branches would check each other – that is, compete – would mean recreating the Hobbesian state of nature-as-war on a higher level. Since the people enter a social contract and institute a government to put the state of nature behind them, not reinstate it in a different form, the separation of powers contradictory Hobbes' views directly.<br/><br/>Locke, on the other hand, embraces separation of power as a foundational principle of his political theory. His case for the separation is evident in the discussion of the limits of the legislative power. As Locke puts it, it would be hardly advisable "for the same persons, who have the power of making laws, to have also in their hands the power to execute them" (76). The philosopher points to the imperfections of human nature and the inherent desire to "grasp at power" as a rationale for this precautionary measure (Locke 76). Just as in Hobbes' case, Locke's account of the separation of powers stems directly from his interpretation of the state of nature. If there is already justice in the state of nature and the people can understand it, any government is inevitably subject to the same natural law. Since absolute power over people violates both limitations of this law, separating and distributing it is advisable so that the government would function appropriately.<br/><br/>This paper has demonstrated that, while the differences between Hobbes' and Locke's accounts of the natural state of humanity are numerous, they ultimately amount to the presence of absence of moral premises. Hobbes views the natural state as that of unlimited liberty, where people endowed with equal capabilities and not bound by any moral notions, such as justice, compete for the resources unceasingly. Locke, however, interprets equality and liberty ethically rather than practically and opines that war is a perversion of the natural state, as the natural law obliges humans not to harm each other. This disagreement influences the philosophers' approaches to government. Hobbes insists on an all-powerful ruler, as, in the absence of ethical restraints, no other authority could force the humans to refrain from harming each other. Yet, in Locke's view, granting the government unlimited powers would be contradictory to the ethical limitations embedded in the law of nature, which is why he, unlike Hobbes, advocates separation of powers. | Le récit de Hobbes vs. Locke sur l'état de la nature<br/><br/>Sujet: PhilosophyWords: 2539Pages: 9Aug 3rd, 2021<br/><br/>Hobbes et Locke sont parmi les philosophes politiques les plus influents à avoir jamais écrit en anglais. L’état de nature, qui précède l’organisation des sociétés complexes, est la prémisse commune que Hobbes et Locke partagent mais interprètent de différentes manières. Le premier considère les humains dans leur état naturel comme tout aussi dangereux et libres de poursuivre leurs objectifs égoïstes sans restriction par les notions inexistantes de justice, ce qui explique pourquoi son état naturel équivaut à la «guerre de tout homme contre tout homme» (Hobbes76). Ces derniers, d’autre part, considèrent les humains dans leur état d’origine comme tout aussi précieux et limitent la liberté naturelle par l’idée de justice qui exige de ne pas nuire aux autres, ce qui permet de définir l’état de la nature comme «assistance mutuelle et préservation» plutôt que la guerre (Locke 15). La principale différence entre les comptes des deux philosophes de l'état naturel est que Locke utilise des considérations éthiques alors que Hobbes ne le fait pas, et il conduit finalement Hobbes à envisager un état exerçant un pouvoir illimité sur les êtres humains, tandis que Locke limite le gouvernement par les principes moraux, qu'il considère comme une loi naturelle.<br/><br/>Hobbes fonde ses hypothèses sur l'état de la nature sur le fait que toutes les personnes sont à peu près égales dans leurs capacités physiques et mentales. Il admet que certains individus peuvent démontrer une plus grande force physique ou une intelligence supérieure, mais insiste sur le fait que « quand tout est compté ensemble, la différence entre l’homme et l’homme n’est pas si considérable » (Hobbes 74). Puisque les humains sont à peu près égaux dans leurs capacités, ils ont également des espoirs similaires pour atteindre leurs fins et satisfaire leurs besoins (Hobbes 75). Comme résultat logique de cette égalité, lorsque le peuple commence à se battre pour des ressources rares, personne ne peut se sentir entièrement en sécurité dans ses possessions. Même si une personne puissante, rusée et capable réussit à soumettre « les personnes de tous les hommes qu’elle peut », elle ne garantit toujours pas la sécurité ultime (Hobbes 75). Comme aucun humain ne peut obtenir une telle supériorité sur les autres qui le rend totalement immunisé contre leur force intellectuelle, aucun humain ne peut se sentir complètement en sécurité lorsqu’il est entouré de ses égaux. L'égalité de Hobbes à l'état naturel est l'égalité de la peur, où tous les humains se considèrent comme des concurrents dangereux.<br/><br/>Tout comme Hobbes, Locke considère que tous les êtres humains sont fondamentalement égaux, mais attribue un sens très différent au terme. De son point de vue, ce n'est pas l'égalité des capacités, mais plutôt l'égalité des valeurs. Il est d'avis que les gens "nés avec promiscuité aux mêmes avantages de la nature" devraient logiquement jouir de la parfaite égalité entre eux, car il n'y a aucune raison de considérer quelqu'un comme intrinsèquement plus précieux (Locke 8). Le seul fondement possible pour désigner certaines personnes comme supérieures aux autres serait que Dieu « par toute déclaration manifeste de sa volonté, place les uns au-dessus des autres » (Locke 8). Comme cette sanction divine de supériorité est absente, Locke conclut que l'égalité naturelle de tous les représentants de l'humanité ne doit pas être remise en question. Hobbes aborde l'égalité de manière pragmatique et souligne que les gens dans leur état naturel sont tout aussi dangereux, mais Locke emploie une approche éthique et souligne que les humains sont tout aussi précieux aux yeux de Dieu. Ce désaccord n'est que la première différence entre les deux auteurs basée sur le fait que Locke inclut Dieu comme prémisse dans sa philosophie politique, alors que Hobbes ne le fait pas.<br/><br/>Un autre trait caractéristique du récit de Hobbes sur l'état naturel est son interprétation de la liberté : selon Hobbes, l'état de nature implique une liberté illimitée de faire tout ce qui est nécessaire pour continuer à exister. Le philosophe définit la liberté comme "l'absence d'obstacles extérieurs" dans l'utilisation de ses capacités pour atteindre ses objectifs (Hobbes 79). Le but principal de chaque être sensible est de maintenir son existence continue. En conséquence, la liberté de Hobbes équivaut à la possibilité sans entrave de faire tout ce qui, à son avis, serait le mieux adapté pour préserver sa vie et ses biens (Hobbes 79). La seule limitation à la liberté est qu'une personne ne peut rien faire de contradictoire au maintien de sa vie ou à la destruction des "moyens de la préserver" (Hobbes 79). En dehors de cela, il n’y a pas de frontières, et chacun a « droit à tout, même au corps de l’autre » si cela favorise sa survie (Hobbes 80). Ainsi, la liberté naturelle, telle que vue par Hobbes, est l'absence d'obstacles imposés de l'extérieur dans la poursuite de son droit à tout pour soutenir et sécuriser son existence continue.<br/><br/>Locke défend également l'idée de la liberté naturelle, mais, sans surprise, l'approche d'une manière qui est significativement différente de celle de Hobbes. Dès qu'il commence à discuter de la liberté dans l'état de nature, il constate immédiatement qu'un état de liberté n'équivaut pas à "un état de licence" (Locke 9). Le philosophe identifie deux limitations spécifiques à la liberté humaine dans l'état de nature. La première est identique à celle introduite par Hobbes : quelque libre et indépendant qu'il soit, une personne « n'a cependant pas la liberté de se détruire » (Locke 9), mais la seconde limite contredit directement les prépositions de Hobbes. Selon Locke, tout être humain a l’obligation naturelle de ne pas « nuire à autrui dans sa vie, sa santé, sa liberté ou ses biens » (9). Tout comme pour son interprétation de l'égalité, l'auteur fonde cette affirmation sur des motifs éthiques et religieux: les gens doivent préserver l'existence de l'autre, car ils sont tous des créations du même "omnipotent et créateur infiniment sage" (Locke 9). Ainsi, Locke limite la liberté à l'état naturel beaucoup plus rigoureusement que Hobbes en introduisant l'obligation de s'abstenir de nuire à la fois à soi-même et aux autres.<br/><br/>Les différences entre les deux auteurs se manifestent également dans leurs récits de la justice dans l'état naturel de l'humanité. En ce qui concerne Hobbes, délimiter des pratiques justes et injustes est simplement la question de la loi. Il n’y a pas de jurisprudence dans l’état de nature, et la seule loi qui gouverne les êtres humains dans leur condition originelle est une loi naturelle qui ne fait que les obliger à rechercher la sécurité personnelle. En conséquence, rien ne peut être injuste dans l’état originel de l’humanité : « les notions de justice et d’injustice justes et injustes » n’ont pas de place et n’ont pas de sens en l’absence d’une loi rigoureusement appliquée (Hobbes 78). Tant que les gens utilisent leur liberté pratiquement illimitée pour rivaliser impitoyablement les uns avec les autres pour des ressources auxquelles ils ont également droit, ils n’ont pas de critères pour faire la différence entre des actions justes et injustes. Par conséquent, l'état hobbesien de la nature défie l'idée même de la justice puisque l'auteur l'interprète comme une simple fonction de la loi formalisée et établie.<br/><br/>Locke donne un sens différent à la justice et ne la considère pas tant sur le plan législatif que sur le plan éthique. Cet article mentionnait déjà que, contrairement à Hobbes, Locke emploie des notions éthiques et fonde généralement sa philosophie politique sur des présomptions morales plutôt que purement pratiques. La loi naturelle de Locke, contrairement à celle de Hobbes, oblige les êtres humains à prendre soin les uns des autres plutôt que de simplement laisser chacun se débrouiller par lui-même. En conséquence, il y a place pour la justice et l'injustice dans son état de nature. L'auteur souligne lui-même ce fait lorsqu'il note que nul ne doit priver un autre de sa vie des moyens de la préserver "à moins que ce ne soit pour rendre justice à un délinquant" (Locke 9). Cette déclaration révèle avec la plus grande clarté que, selon Locke, il y a de la justice dans l’état de nature, et, de plus, les humains doivent la préserver activement. Le critère de la justice, qui manque à l'état naturel de Hobbes, est la seconde limitation de la liberté naturelle imposée par Locke : une action est injuste si elle constitue une menace injustifiée pour la vie et les biens d'une autre personne.<br/><br/>Ces différences dans le traitement des deux auteurs de l'égalité, de la liberté et de la justice ou de l'injustice culminent dans leur interprétation de la relation entre l'état de nature et l'état de guerre. Du point de vue de Hobbes, les deux sont synonymes, parce que la concurrence impitoyable est le seul résultat logique de mettre des personnes ayant des capacités équivalentes et des besoins similaires dans un environnement avec des ressources limitées. Il déclare carrément cette connexion: "si deux hommes désirent la même chose, dont ils ne peuvent néanmoins pas jouir tous les deux, ils deviennent ennemis" et sont, par conséquent, en état de guerre l'un contre l'autre (Hobbes 75). Pourtant, puisque les humains sont nombreux et possèdent tous des capacités et des besoins similaires, cette compétition se manifeste non seulement dans les interactions individuelles, mais aussi au niveau de l’humanité dans son ensemble. Tant que tous les humains ont des droits égaux et illimités sur toutes les ressources et même sur les corps et les vies des uns et des autres, l’état de nature est une guerre de « tout homme contre tout homme » (Hobbes 76). Cette interprétation sinistre découle directement de la représentation de Hobbes de l'état de nature tel que régi uniquement par les pulsions égoïstes des individus.<br/><br/>Locke, d’autre part, fait la différence entre l’état de nature et l’état de guerre et souligne que, bien qu’ils puissent se produire simultanément, ce n’est pas une raison pour s’identifier l’un à l’autre. La définition de Locke de l'état de guerre est pratiquement identique à celle offerte par Hobbes. Selon Locke, « celui qui tente d'obtenir un autre homme dans son pouvoir absolu se met ainsi dans un état de guerre avec lui » (14). Cette explication s'aligne parfaitement avec la notion hobbesienne que le droit universel de chacun à tout, y compris le corps et la vie des autres, conduit à l'état de guerre. Pourtant, Locke refuse d'assimiler l'état de guerre et l'état de nature précisément parce qu'il nie l'interprétation de Hobbes de la liberté naturelle. Puisque l'état naturel de Locke empêche les gens de se nuire les uns aux autres par la deuxième limitation de la liberté, une tentative sur la liberté d'une autre personne est une transgression contre la loi naturelle. Alors que pour Hobbes, la guerre est la condition par défaut de l'humanité, Locke la dépeint comme une perversion de l'état de la nature plutôt que de sa domination.<br/><br/>Ces différences dans la délimitation de l'État sur la nature et ses constituants, tels que la liberté, l'égalité, la justice et la guerre, ouvrent la voie aux auteurs des représentations contrastées du gouvernement. Sur la base de son évaluation pessimiste de l'état de la nature, l'auteur de Léviathan conclut que, dans des conditions de guerre, il ne peut y avoir d'espoir certain de "vivre le temps que la nature permet habituellement aux hommes de vivre" (Hobbes 80). La solution est d'établir le droit universel à tout et de laisser à chacun "autant de liberté contre les autres hommes, qu'il permettrait à d'autres hommes contre lui-même" (Hobbes 80). Les participants au contrat social qui en résulte investissent les libertés illimitées qu’ils ont cédées dans un souverain – le porteur du pouvoir suprême dont le but est de préserver le statu quo atteint en punissant toutes les transgressions contre lui. Le pouvoir du souverain est absolu : le souverain a le pouvoir de « faire tout ce qu’il jugera nécessaire » pour promouvoir la paix entre ses sujets afin que personne n’attaque la vie ou les biens d’autrui (113). Hobbes conclut que sans une telle figure inattaquable ayant le droit de faire quoi que ce soit aux sujets, il ne peut y avoir de paix et aucune garantie de sécurité.<br/><br/>Alors que Locke est d'accord avec la nécessité de créer des sociétés politiquement organisées, il s'oppose néanmoins à l'idée de Hobbes du pouvoir souverain comme illimité et inattaquable. Comme mentionné ci-dessus, l'état de nature de Locke n'est pas aussi terrible que celui peint par Hobbes à cause de l'obligation du peuple de se préserver non seulement lui-même, mais aussi les uns les autres. Par conséquent, le besoin de contrat social ne provient pas de la peur des autres, mais de la simple commodité. Les petites communautés n’ont peut-être pas besoin de nombreuses lois pour résoudre les conflits et « d’officiers pour superviser le processus », mais les associations plus grandes trouvent souhaitable d’instituer des gouvernements à cette fin (Locke 57). Pourtant, le pouvoir du gouvernement ne peut être illimité parce qu'il aurait pour résultat de soumettre les sujets à une "volonté inconstante, incertaine, inconnue, arbitraire d'un autre homme" (Locke 17). Un tel gouvernement constituerait une double violation de la loi naturelle. En acceptant le pouvoir absolu d'une autre personne sur sa vie, un sujet violerait sa première limitation interdisant de se faire du mal. Quant au dirigeant, la destruction de la liberté d'une autre personne constituerait un préjudice direct et, en tant que tel, irait à l'encontre de la seconde limitation.<br/><br/>Poursuivant directement son argument en faveur d'une autorité gouvernementale illimitée, Hobbes nie la séparation des pouvoirs en tant que principe. De son point de vue, le souverain, une fois institué, possède «tout le pouvoir de prescrire les règles» régissant la vie des sujets ou, en termes plus courts, le pouvoir législatif (Hobbes 114). Le souverain se réserve également le droit "d'entendre et de trancher toutes les controverses", c'est-à-dire le pouvoir judiciaire (Hobbes 114). Enfin, puisque tout le but du souverain est de forcer les sujets à s’abstenir de se nuire les uns aux autres, il ne fait aucun doute que le pouvoir exécutif est aussi sa prérogative exclusive. La séparation des pouvoirs en tant que concept est étrangère à Hobbes en raison de ses vues sur l'état de la nature. Créer une entité politique où les pouvoirs exécutif, législatif et judiciaire se contrôleraient mutuellement – c’est-à-dire se concurrenceraient – signifierait recréer l’état hobbesien de la nature comme guerre à un niveau supérieur. Puisque le peuple conclut un contrat social et institue un gouvernement pour mettre l'état de nature derrière lui, et non pour le rétablir sous une forme différente, la séparation des pouvoirs contredit directement les vues de Hobbes.<br/><br/>Locke, d'autre part, embrasse la séparation du pouvoir comme un principe fondamental de sa théorie politique. Son argument en faveur de la séparation est évident dans la discussion des limites du pouvoir législatif. Comme Locke le dit, il ne serait guère souhaitable « que les mêmes personnes, qui ont le pouvoir de faire des lois, aient aussi entre leurs mains le pouvoir de les exécuter » (76). Le philosophe souligne les imperfections de la nature humaine et le désir inhérent de «saisir le pouvoir» comme justification de cette mesure de précaution (Locke 76). Tout comme dans le cas de Hobbes, le récit de Locke sur la séparation des pouvoirs découle directement de son interprétation de l'état de nature. S’il y a déjà justice dans l’état de nature et que le peuple peut la comprendre, tout gouvernement est inévitablement soumis à la même loi naturelle. Étant donné que le pouvoir absolu sur les gens viole les deux limites de cette loi, il est conseillé de la séparer et de la distribuer afin que le gouvernement fonctionne correctement.<br/><br/>Cet article a démontré que, si les différences entre les récits de Hobbes et de Locke sur l'état naturel de l'humanité sont nombreuses, elles constituent en fin de compte l'absence de prémisses morales. Hobbes considère l'état naturel comme celui de la liberté illimitée, où les gens dotés de capacités égales et non liés par des notions morales, telles que la justice, se disputent sans cesse les ressources. Locke, cependant, interprète l’égalité et la liberté de manière éthique plutôt que pratique et estime que la guerre est une perversion de l’état naturel, car la loi naturelle oblige les humains à ne pas se nuire les uns aux autres. Hobbes insiste sur un dirigeant tout-puissant, car, en l'absence de restrictions éthiques, aucune autre autorité ne pourrait forcer les humains à s'abstenir de se nuire les uns aux autres. Pourtant, de l'avis de Locke, accorder au gouvernement des pouvoirs illimités serait contradictoire avec les limitations éthiques inhérentes à la loi de la nature, c'est pourquoi il préconise, contrairement à Hobbes, la séparation des pouvoirs. |
| Fashion Police: What Game of Thrones threw up<br/><br/>Canadian-French singer Abbas Hasan put blinding effort to outshine all of humanity at Fashion Parade 2014. Nothing wrong with that, except safety is priority and the musician is a health hazard here.<br/><br/>We get he wants to be a star. Sadly, he didn't get the memo where they tell the desperate and the infamous that stardom is a metaphor. You don't have to look like one and literally set our sight ablaze. Also, the All Pakistan Aunty Association has officially lodged a complaint against him. The local market has run dry of fake crystals and sequined monstrosities. They have nothing to wear to their biweekly high teas and they claim he is to blame. Apparently, the outfit is inspired by Game of Thrones. Can he please stick to composing sad songs about his neighbour's dead dog instead of conceptualising outfits? Or maybe it's the trauma of losing the dog, whose death he is clearly not over as he is still wearing its carcass.<br/><br/>The charge sheet Outfit<br/><br/>No one can decide where the outfit begins and where Abbas ends. You stare in fascination, sinking into a deep abyss and wonder why he is wearing leather pants. Whose horse did he kill to steal the saddle draped across his shoulders? Was he in prison right before his red carpet appearance and forgot to take off the chains? How will he survive the synthetic leather and post-sequin rash that is bound to be lethal in such high dosage? Why am I still alive?<br/><br/>Idea<br/><br/>His inspiration was seemingly Game of Thrones, but he eventually ended up looking like he was thrown out of a Viking restaurant. Had he come across any of the characters from the show, he would've been slain in the first five seconds of the first episode.<br/><br/>The mental health or lack thereof: Someone get him to a counsellor ASAP! He seems to be under the assumption that wearing a dead dog means that the only friend he had in his life is still alive. Dear Abbas:<br/><br/>1. Denial is not a river in Egypt<br/><br/>2. Your tortured psyche is not helping your music, so get help<br/><br/>3. Try imaginary friends<br/><br/>Bail out!<br/><br/>All of us at the Fashion Police headquarters are severely traumatised. Abbas is someone we did not enjoy arresting. He is currently in custody and attempting revenge by putting on attires from other fantasy shows. He just glitter glued himself in order to look like Edward Cullen from Twilight. As a public service message and to prevent further nervous breakdowns, we gave him the following examples of men from the red carpet of the same event.<br/><br/>Zohaib Hassan<br/><br/>When in doubt, play it safe. The singer looks like your average uncle at a shaadi. A plain black suit with no accessories, even if it's a tad disproportionate, is workable. Zohaib's look is blended into everything and nothing, and when you don't have a fashion sense or the money to hire a stylist, this is okay. It does not carry the risk of cardiac arrest for fellow attendees at an event. Given Abbas' delicate mental condition, this look is what he should aim for. Always and forever.<br/><br/>Ali Zafar<br/><br/>One day, after decades of therapy, Abbas could aspire to wear attire like Ali Zafar's. The dapper summer look is done to near perfection. Ali came really close to looking like a maître d at a French restaurant with his white summer jacket with black lapels, but the shirt saves it, never mind the satin. His pants would have been ridiculous had they not been folded at the ankles. The shoes are what hipster chic happy endings are made of. | Police de la mode: ce que Game of Thrones a lancé<br/><br/>Le chanteur franco-canadien Abbas Hasan a déployé des efforts aveuglants pour surpasser toute l’humanité à la Fashion Parade 2014. Rien de mal à cela, sauf la sécurité est la priorité et le musicien est un danger pour la santé ici.<br/><br/>On comprend qu'il veut être une star. Malheureusement, il n'a pas eu le mémo où ils disent au désespéré et à l'infâme que la célébrité est une métaphore. Vous n'avez pas à ressembler à un et à mettre littéralement notre vue en feu. En outre, la All Pakistan Aunty Association a officiellement déposé une plainte contre lui. Le marché local est à sec de faux cristaux et de monstruosités à paillettes. Ils n'ont rien à porter à leurs thés élevés deux fois par semaine et ils prétendent qu'il est à blâmer. Apparemment, la tenue est inspirée de Game of Thrones. Peut-il s'il vous plaît s'en tenir à composer des chansons tristes sur le chien mort de son voisin au lieu de conceptualiser des tenues? Ou peut-être est-ce le traumatisme de la perte du chien, dont il n'est clairement pas fini car il porte toujours sa carcasse.<br/><br/>La fiche de charge<br/><br/>Personne ne peut décider où la tenue commence et où Abbas se termine. Vous regardez avec fascination, sombrant dans un abîme profond et vous vous demandez pourquoi il porte un pantalon en cuir. De qui a-t-il tué pour voler la selle drapée sur ses épaules? Était-il en prison juste avant son apparition sur le tapis rouge et a-t-il oublié d'enlever les chaînes? Comment va-t-il survivre à l'éruption de cuir synthétique et de post-sequin qui est fatale à une telle dose? Pourquoi suis-je encore en vie?<br/><br/>Idée<br/><br/>Son inspiration était apparemment Game of Thrones, mais il a fini par avoir l'air d'avoir été jeté hors d'un restaurant Viking. S'il avait rencontré l'un des personnages de la série, il aurait été tué dans les cinq premières secondes du premier épisode.<br/><br/>La santé mentale ou l'absence de celle-ci: Quelqu'un l'amène à un conseiller dès que possible! Il semble être sous l'hypothèse que le port d'un chien mort signifie que le seul ami qu'il avait dans sa vie est encore en vie. Cher Abbas:<br/><br/>1. Le déni n'est pas un fleuve en Egypte<br/><br/>2. Votre psyché torturée n'aide pas votre musique, alors obtenez de l'aide<br/><br/>3. Essayez les amis imaginaires<br/><br/>Sauvez-vous !<br/><br/>Nous tous au siège de la police de la mode sommes gravement traumatisés. Abbas est quelqu'un que nous n'avons pas apprécié d'arrêter. Il est actuellement en garde à vue et tente de se venger en portant des tenues d'autres spectacles de fantasy. Comme message de service public et pour éviter d'autres dépressions nerveuses, nous lui avons donné les exemples suivants d'hommes du tapis rouge du même événement.<br/><br/>Zohaib Hassan<br/><br/>En cas de doute, jouez-le en toute sécurité. Le chanteur ressemble à votre oncle moyen à un shaadi. Un costume noir uni sans accessoires, même si c'est un peu disproportionné, est réalisable. Le look de Zohaib est mélangé à tout et à rien, et quand vous n'avez pas le sens de la mode ou l'argent pour embaucher un styliste, c'est correct. Il ne comporte pas le risque d'arrêt cardiaque pour les autres participants à un événement. Compte tenu de la condition mentale délicate d'Abbas, ce regard est ce qu'il devrait viser. Toujours et pour toujours.<br/><br/>Ali Zafar<br/><br/>Un jour, après des décennies de thérapie, Abbas pourrait aspirer à porter des vêtements comme ceux d'Ali Zafar. Ali est venu vraiment près de ressembler à un maître d'un restaurant français avec sa veste d'été blanche à revers noirs, mais la chemise le sauve, peu importe le satin. Son pantalon aurait été ridicule s'ils n'avaient pas été pliés aux chevilles. Les chaussures sont ce que les fins heureuses hipster chic sont faites. |
| Determining soil hydraulic properties with different wetting liquids : A thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the Degree of Master of Science at Lincoln University<br/><br/>Abstract<br/><br/>Soil hydraulic properties such as hydraulic conductivity, water retention and plant water relationships dominate the water movement processes. For example, the infiltration, evaporation and water flow within the soil. As a widespread phenomenon in soil, soil water repellency alters the soil hydraulic functions by resisting the water flow into the soils. Moreover, the hydraulic properties not only depend on the pore system of soil but also are affected by the physicochemical properties of the pore surfaces. Compared to water, ethanol is not affected by the water repellency due to its lower surface tension. The purpose of using ethanol is to eliminate the effect of soil water repellency on hydraulic properties measurements. However, applying pure ethanol into natural soil can degrade the soil organic materials and lead to changes in physical properties. Therefore, the aqueous ethanol solutions can be an alternative option. Nevertheless, the feasibility of using aqueous ethanol for determining soil liquid retention curve remains unknown. This study aims to test the feasibility of the aqueous ethanol solutions (0, 10 %, 20 %, 30 %, 40 %, 50 % and 100 % v/v) for establishing liquid retention curve under a small range of applied pressure in coarse sand samples with different wettability and organic amended natural soil (Templeton silt loam (TSL) with mushroom compost, biochar, dairy effluent, and municipal compost, the application rate was 15 % by weight). The result showed that the desorption of testing aqueous ethanol solutions compared to water was quicker by approximately 1 to 3x based on the liquid content at the same applied pressure and the time for reaching each equilibrium. The outcomes from the sand experiment suggested that when the concentration of aqueous ethanol solution was below 50 %, the losses via evaporation were less than 1% and the relative differences between testing liquid and water was lower than 10 %. However, the evaporation losses were 11.06 % and 24.6 %, and the relative differences were all around 15 % and 30 % in 50 % and 100 % ethanol solution, respectively. In contrast, the organic amendments in Templeton silt loam not only increased the water retention capability but also reduced the evaporation losses. The evaporation losses in TSL soil and TSL with organic amendments soil were with 1 % in solutions with less than 50 % ethanol content. Evaporation losses of 50 % and 100 % ethanol were 2.8 % and 2.9 %, respectively. The relative differences between water and testing liquid were similar to the sand experiment when the testing liquid concentrations were below 50 %. However, the relative differences in 50 % and 100 % ethanol solution were smaller than in the sand sample with around 10 % and 15%, respectively. Additionally, the analysis of relative difference suggested that almost all aqueous ethanol solutions had lower volumetric liquid content at the same supplied pressure compared to water, which was a reflection of the aqueous ethanol solutions desorbed faster than water under equivalent pressure. Therefore, 10 % to 40 % of ethanol solutions could be considered an alternative for determining soil hydraulic properties due to their faster desorption rate and not being affected by soil water repellency. Due to the evaporation and dissolution of organic material, aqueous ethanol solutions above 50% concentration were not suitable for coarse sand or medium-textured soil.... [Show full abstract] | Détermination des propriétés hydrauliques du sol avec différents liquides de mouillage : Une thèse soumise en réponse partielle aux exigences du diplôme de maîtrise ès sciences de l'Université Lincoln<br/><br/>Résumé<br/><br/>Les propriétés hydrauliques du sol telles que la conductivité hydraulique, la rétention d'eau et les relations entre l'eau et les plantes dominent les processus de mouvement de l'eau. Par exemple, l'infiltration, l'évaporation et le débit d'eau dans le sol. En tant que phénomène répandu dans le sol, la répulsion de l'eau du sol modifie les fonctions hydrauliques du sol en résistant au flux d'eau dans les sols. En outre, les propriétés hydrauliques ne dépendent pas seulement du système poreux du sol, mais sont également affectées par les propriétés physico-chimiques des surfaces des pores. Par rapport à l'eau, l'éthanol n'est pas affecté par la déperlance de l'eau en raison de sa tension superficielle inférieure. L'utilisation de l'éthanol a pour but d'éliminer l'effet de la déperlance de l'eau du sol sur les mesures des propriétés hydrauliques, mais l'application d'éthanol pur dans le sol naturel peut dégrader les matières organiques du sol et entraîner des changements dans les propriétés physiques. Par conséquent, les solutions aqueuses d'éthanol peuvent être une alternative, mais la possibilité d'utiliser de l'éthanol aqueux pour déterminer la courbe de rétention des liquides du sol reste inconnue. Cette étude vise à tester la faisabilité des solutions aqueuses d'éthanol (0, 10 %, 20 %, 30 %, 40 %, 50 % et 100 % v/v) pour l'établissement d'une courbe de rétention de liquide sous une faible plage de pression appliquée dans des échantillons de sable grossier avec une mouillabilité différente et un sol naturel modifié organique [Templeton silt loam (TSL) avec du compost de champignons, du biochar, des effluents laitiers et du compost municipal. Le résultat a montré que la désorption des solutions aqueuses d'éthanol testées par rapport à l'eau était plus rapide d'environ 1 à 3 fois en fonction de la teneur en liquide à la même pression appliquée et du temps nécessaire pour atteindre chaque équilibre. Les résultats de l'expérience sur le sable ont suggéré que lorsque la concentration de la solution aqueuse d'éthanol était inférieure à 50 %, les pertes par évaporation étaient inférieures à 1 % et les différences relatives entre le liquide d'essai et l'eau étaient inférieures à 10 %. Cependant, les pertes par évaporation étaient de 11,06 % et 24,6 %, et les différences relatives étaient toutes d'environ 15 % et 30 % dans une solution d'éthanol à 50 % et 100 %, respectivement. En revanche, les amendements organiques dans le limon de Templeton ont non seulement augmenté la capacité de rétention d'eau, mais également réduit les pertes par évaporation. Les pertes par évaporation dans le sol TSL et le sol TSL avec amendements organiques étaient de 1 % dans des solutions contenant moins de 50 % d'éthanol, les pertes par évaporation de 50 % et 100 % d'éthanol étant de 2,8 % et 2,9 %, respectivement. Les différences relatives entre l'eau et le liquide d'essai étaient similaires à celles de l'expérience sur le sable lorsque les concentrations de liquide d'essai étaient inférieures à 50 %. Cependant, les différences relatives dans la solution d'éthanol à 50 % et 100 % étaient plus faibles que dans l'échantillon de sable avec environ 10 % et 15 %, respectivement. En outre, l'analyse de la différence relative a suggéré que presque toutes les solutions aqueuses d'éthanol avaient une teneur en liquide volumétrique plus faible à la même pression fournie par rapport à l'eau, ce qui était un reflet des solutions aqueuses d'éthanol désorbées plus rapidement que l'eau sous pression équivalente. Par conséquent, 10 à 40 % des solutions d'éthanol pourraient être considérées comme une alternative pour déterminer les propriétés hydrauliques du sol en raison de leur taux de désorption plus rapide et de leur absence d'imperméabilité à l'eau du sol. En raison de l'évaporation et de la dissolution de la matière organique, les solutions aqueuses d'éthanol supérieures à 50% de concentration ne convenaient pas pour le sable grossier ou le sol à texture moyenne....
