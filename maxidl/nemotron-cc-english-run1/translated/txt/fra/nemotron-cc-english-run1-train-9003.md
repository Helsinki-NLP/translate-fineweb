| The Masterpiece: a Chain Poetry Challenge<br/><br/>John has been writing poetry since his school days. He was awarded the "Best Poet 2014 and 2021" Hubby Awards.<br/><br/>Madame Monet in a Japanese kimono, 1875<br/><br/>Claude Monet [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>A Brief History of Collaborative, Collective, or Chain Poetry<br/><br/>Collaborative,collective, or chain poetry is an alternative and creative technique for writing poetry by more than one person. The principal aim of this type of poetry is to create poems through the collaboration of various authors/poets, trying to form a unified voice while still maintain their individual voices.<br/><br/>Examples of collaboration abound in Japanese poetry. Though the precise accounts and records of many such events are either lost or missing.<br/><br/>One of the most famous examples of collective poetry writing was the poem collection titled Ralentir Travaux by Surrealist French poets André Breton, Paul Éluard and René Char. These three poets collaborated to write the poems in this collection over just five days in 1930.<br/><br/>During the 1940s, Charles Henri Ford, an American poet, invented what he called the "chain poem", where each poet wrote a line and then sent the poem to another person (to continue) in another part of the world, by post.<br/><br/>In 2007 a collection of American collaborative poetry Saints of Hysteria: A Half-Century of Collaborative American Poetry was edited and published by Denise Duhamel, Maureen Seaton and David Trinidad.<br/><br/>Collaborative poetry writing has been used in schools and colleges to teach students teamwork and to discover ways in which they are connected.(source: Wikipedia)<br/><br/>Study of a Figure Outdoors: Woman with a Parasol, facing left, 1886<br/><br/>Claude Monet [Public domain or Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>The Aim of This Article and How to Approach the Challenge<br/><br/>A few years back I wrote an article called "Poem Without an End" which included a Christmas poem I had written that lent itself to being added to. I was amazed by the response as at that stage I only had a few followers here. People wrote a stanza of poetry each in "comments" on the hub to follow on from the previous commenter's stanza. It worked out very well and at the end I compiled all the contributions into a single poem as part of the hub.<br/><br/>Similar challenges have been issued since, including one by Frank Atanacio called "Spirits Sat as Mourners" that was also very successful. The difference being that in that instance contributors wrote their own hubs for their stanza of poetry and placed a link on Frank's original hub.<br/><br/>For this particular challenge I don't expect everyone to spend valuable time writing separate hubs for one stanza of poetry (unless you really want to). The main problem being that to make it effective you would have to copy the previously written parts of the poem onto your hub and would probably be hit with "duplication" label.<br/><br/>So, that being the case, and also to save having to leave links everywhere, I just ask that anyone who wants to take part just write their stanza here in "comments." Check the last comment before yours that is contributing to the challenge and follow on. If I see more than one following from the same stanza I will use my poetic licence to work them in as I deem best.<br/><br/>At some stage when I feel there has been enough stanzas added I will probably call an end to the challenge and then compile them all together as the completed poem as part of the article (also giving credit to each contributor).<br/><br/>Flowered Riverbank, Argenteuil<br/><br/>Claude Monet [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>The Challenge!<br/><br/>Now comes the interesting part. If you join this chain poetry challenge you have to try to keep the style and voice of the poem as close as possible to the preceding verses, so that to uninformed readers it will appear that only one author has written the entire poem.<br/><br/>Sounds easy, you say? Well maybe it would be if the poem had a traditional style, rhyme or meter. But this one doesn't! The poem you will be adding to was started by an acquaintance of mine Andriealphus as a "chain poem challenge" elsewhere. At the time of writing I was the only other person who had accepted the challenge, and because I loved the subject I thought it would be a great challenge for my fellow writers and decided to use it here and see if the response would be better. (I know of a few poets here whose writing would suit this style)<br/><br/>Rules :<br/><br/>Follow on from the previous stanza in comments<br/><br/>Try to retain the voice and style of the poem<br/><br/>Keep your stanza/verse to approximately the same length as those before<br/><br/>Claude Monet was one of the most famous painters in the history of art and a leading figure in the Impressionist movement.<br/><br/>In 1883 Monet moved to Giverny. Here, he loved to paint outdoors in the gardens that he helped create. The water lilies found in the pond had a particular appeal, and he painted several series of them throughout the rest of his life; the Japanese-style bridge over the pond became the subject of several works, as well.<br/><br/>In 1912 Monet painted a series of 12 waterlily paintings commissioned by the Orangerie des Tuileries, a museum in Paris. He chose to make them on a very large scale, and to serve as a "haven of peaceful meditation." This project consumed much of Monet's later years. Monet once stated, "These landscapes of water and reflection have become an obsession for me. It is beyond my strength as an old man, and yet I want to render what I feel."<br/><br/>His health was now an obstacle, as well. Nearly blind, with both of his eyes seriously affected by cataracts, Monet finally agreed to undergo surgery for the ailment in 1923.<br/><br/>Monet's famous water lilies turned redder as his cataracts progressed. After getting corrective surgery he destroyed most of the "red lily" paintings, angry that no one really mentioned it to him. Ironically, these paintings were probably what made his impressionistic style so famous in that time -- artists started taking more risks with color and such during this point. (source: biography.com)<br/><br/>The Masterpiece<br/><br/>"The boy sitting behind you says you look like a masterpiece.<br/><br/>Ask him, has he ever seen a Monet up close?<br/><br/>Close enough to see nothing but muddled strokes of weedy lakeshore?<br/><br/>Close enough to dip his fingers into the ridges<br/><br/>where oil paints hardened under an artist's gaze?<br/><br/>Close enough to breathe onto the blood lilies?<br/><br/>Ask him, why did he paint them red?" (Andriealphus)<br/><br/>He grinned like Carroll's cheshire cat.<br/><br/>"Through clouded and bloodshot eyes I imagine.<br/><br/>Be my waterlilies!" he says,<br/><br/>"Feel my breath and let my fingers delve,<br/><br/>become my masterpiece instead.<br/><br/>A brush has never touched a canvas as fine as your fair skin.<br/><br/>Let the masters weep in jealousy,<br/><br/>and Van Gogh slice his ear in envy at the beauty of your nakedness."(Jodah)<br/><br/>Self portrait with bandaged ear<br/><br/>Vincent van Gogh [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>Responses<br/><br/>Now it's your turn. Please write your response in the comments below, remembering to check those immediately before yours for the last written stanza of the poem. If you do decide to write a separate hub for your stanza of verse, make sure you leave a link here in comments.<br/><br/>The Finished Masterpiece<br/><br/>All contributions have been received and I have put the finished poem together with only some slight edits. I hope everyone is happy with the result.

And the beauty we can still enjoy today from all his work.<br/><br/>This is a great challenge! I am really looking forward to adding to this.<br/><br/>I first wanted to stop in and let you know that, up for sure. Shared too.<br/><br/>And thank you so much for all the challenges to help the rest of us, keep our mental energy flowing and giving it a work out! You are the best.<br/><br/>The information about LuLu and the free ISBN number is an answered prayer! So, smile my friend. You are a gift!<br/><br/>Hugs. :-)<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 12, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi again Marj. I think I may have all the verses that are going to come. I have been doing my best to arrange them as I think best with just a little editing. I will probably post the finished poem as a separate hub with a link on this one to it. My book is available on Lulu and iBooks...there's a link on one of the earlier comments. I'd really appreciate it if you were to purhase a copy. Bear in mind it's my first eBook so the formatting etc isn't perfect, but it's taken me seven revisions I think to get it where it is. It will all be easier next time. If you need help let me know.<br/><br/>travmaj from australia on August 12, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi John, you have certainly had some excellent responses to your challenge - I'm sure you'll fuse it altogether beautifully although I imagine a difficult task. I'm interested in your poetry books also - I really have to get my act together technologically - I'll try and check it all out...cheers -<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi Jo, both books 'On the Wings of Eagles" and "I Laughed a Smile" have mostly the same content...except the former has one extra poem. Originally they were in different formats, one ePub, the other PDF but now they are both ePub. They are available through Lulu and iBooks, soon Barnes and Noble and Nook (not Amazon). I may try publishing another book through Amazon soon just to see how it compares. Thanks again.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>John, thanks a lot, the info on publishing with Lulu will be quite useful as I'm thinking of publishing but I'm currently torn between Amazon and Lulu. I wanted to purchase one of your books, but I couldn't seem to find them on Amazon. However, I'll probably get it from Lulu. Wishing you every success, you deserve it.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Hey Phyllis, thanks for ontributing. I like it, a perfect ending to the poem I think.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks Faith.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi Jo, I think I have sorted out the poem satisfactorily. Just waiting to see if there is any more to add. Publishing with Lulu wasn't bad and now that I've done it once it will be easier next time. Getting the formatting to look right in the eBook was the hardest, though you and just type it in a word document and Lulu automatically produces the contents page and converts the document to ePub or PDF you can only use certain fonts and have to make sure the chapter names or poem titles are in Heading 1. They also provide a free ISBN number if you want. Overall it was easier than expected however.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Phyllis, this is succinct and beautiful, I love it. Shyron's did an excellent job also, I thought I'd already commented on her verse, but I hadn't.<br/><br/>Phyllis Doyle Burns from High desert of Nevada. on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Wonderful hub, great idea, Jodah. Here is one from me. Short but sweet. Hope it is okay:<br/><br/>And this the beauty be<br/><br/>From Masters past we see<br/><br/>Impressed upon the boy<br/><br/>Bestowed on her with joy<br/><br/>Faith Reaper from southern USA on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks John and Jo. You are kind. Jo, you have always been a brilliant poet. I, too, am looking forward to the end result after John does his magic to pull it all together.<br/><br/>I will share again to see if there are any more takers.<br/><br/>Blessings<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Faith, beautifully done, I find it incredible how someone with such limited vision can teach us so much about beauty, light and shadows. John, looking forward to reading the end result.<br/><br/>By the way, congtats on publishing your poems. How did you find the process of publishing with Lulu?<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks for your great submission Faith. No it's not too late, I'm still compiling the final poem so it should be up for all to see in a day or two.<br/><br/>Faith Reaper from southern USA on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi John,<br/><br/>I apologize for my late submission here to your wonderful challenge. I am off from work a couple of day and decided to give this a go while my husband is resting from knee surgery. If it does not meet with your standards, please feel free to not use it in your final poem or edit as you deem necessary.<br/><br/>Blessings always<br/><br/>Here it goes:<br/><br/>Confessions to friend Georges Clemenceau<br/><br/>Of light encapsulating both torment, joy<br/><br/>Fervent madness in analyzing colors<br/><br/>Consequential spontaneous creations<br/><br/>Season after season of obsession<br/><br/>Capturing different hues in a single moment<br/><br/>Attentive while strolling in Argenteuill<br/><br/>Brushwork bares masterpiece.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 09, 2015:<br/><br/>Just a shout out to see if anyone else still wants to contribute to this chain poem. I have started compiling the stanzas together but will leave it open for a couple more days in case anyone else is intending to join in. Thanks to all who have contributed.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 02, 2015:<br/><br/>Thank you Genna. It appears Monet is a favourite arist of many here. I hope you'll take part in this challenge too :)<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 02, 2015:<br/><br/>Thank you for a great contribution Shyron. This is a very nice verse. Well done.<br/><br/>Genna East from Massachusetts, USA on August 02, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi John...<br/><br/>I started to read this wonderful challenge (Monet is one of my favorite artists), then came back to finish reading some of the beautiful contributions that give this painting a stunning voice through perception and the senses.

I'm so glad you like my contribution. This is a very good idea, I know you'll have fun putting it all together. Take care and my best to you.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks Deb, yes I am impressed by the standard of submissions. I'm looking forward to putting it all together.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Yes Ann, it is good to see the poets among us take up the challenge with some great contributions so far. I just hope Imcan do it justice when it comes to putting it together.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Well done Jo. The word "sublime" comes to mind. I hoped all the poets would rise to the fore, and they have. Love it, thanks for contributing.<br/><br/>Deb Hirt from Stillwater, OK on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>I am excited to see what you end up with here. There are a number of fine poets rising to the challenge, so go to it!<br/><br/>Ann Carr from SW England on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Great one, Jo!<br/><br/>You've got everyone going, John! Rather you than me, putting all this together, but it's going to be a humdinger of a poem when it finally comes to an end - if it ever does! You've really started something.<br/><br/>Ann<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Ok, John here goes nothing! Following from Kim's. I hope it reads well.<br/><br/>And the boy began to walk away<br/><br/>But in his wake, I heard him say<br/><br/>"I took a trip to Orangerie<br/><br/>Where the ghost of Monet still abides<br/><br/>I sat right down and gazed awhile<br/><br/>Until I heard a soft voice cry.<br/><br/>"Have you ever seen a fluid dream?<br/><br/>Where light evolves into what it touch<br/><br/>Where serenity flows through cloudy veil<br/><br/>Where the magician's brush like lightening rush<br/><br/>Have you ever seen a sight sublime?<br/><br/>A child born of distorted illusion<br/><br/>This flowering pond that traps the light<br/><br/>That lift the heart and beckons the soul<br/><br/>An abstract pulchritude up close<br/><br/>Move back, behold; such tranquil delight."<br/><br/>I hope this is in line with what the others have done. Feel free to edit if needed. My best...<br/><br/>Jo.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Alrighty!<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Yes Jo, please do. Anyone is welcome to do more than one stanza. I may add another myself at some stage.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>John, I've decided to have a go, but it's about 16 lines, can I do it in two stanzas following on from Kim's wonderful submission? You can always edit it later.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on July 31, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi Jo, sorry to hear you are under the weather at the moment. I am not in a hurry to close this challenge so I'll keep it open until you are back firing on all cylinders and are able to contribute. You are one of the hubbers I was looking forward to getting a response from as I thought it would suit. Thank you for your kind words, and get well soon.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on July 31, 2015:<br/><br/>Wow! John I can't believe I almost missed your incredible challenged. This is something in which I would have loved to participate since Claude Monet is one of my all times favourite artist. Unfortunately, I must cry off. I'm a bit under the weather with a head full of cotton wool, or so it seems. If the challenge is still open when I get rid of this pesky flu I may give it a go, but I must say, the standard is exceptionally high. Maj took it to another level but all the submissions are brilliant. Kudos to you Andriealphus and the other writers who participated so far in this artistic and creative masterpiece.<br/><br/>My best always Jo.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on July 31, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi again Maj, glad this poem inspired you, and yes it beats watching the cricket especially with the Aussie batsmen performing badly in this third test. It will be an interesting exercise for me to fuse all the stanzas together but should be good.<br/><br/>travmaj from australia on July 30, 2015:<br/><br/>John, thank you, I'm most happy you like my offering. I found the poem intriguing and suddenly felt inspired to write my version in the same mode. I'm not sure I wrote a continuation from the stanza before (alwaysexploring) but I'm sure you will fuse it altogether when the time comes. Love all the responses. I haven't managed any creative writing for yonks, can't wait now to start over, just need some time. (beats watching the cricket too!!!) Cheers John, will be checking in -<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on July 30, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks for checking Dana. I am pleased with the quality of responses so far. I just have to wait and see how many more come in. The final,poem should be great.<br/><br/>Dana Tate from LOS ANGELES on July 30, 2015:<br/><br/>Just checking in to see how things are going, I can't wait for the finished product. I attended a poetry class and we did this also it was really fun.<br/><br/>ocfireflies from North Carolina on July 29, 2015:<br/><br/>John,<br/><br/>Thanks so much for providing the platform for without that it is easy to fall down.<br/><br/>; ) Kim<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on July 29, 2015:<br/><br/>Thank you Devika. I haven't seen you around in awhile, I hope all is well.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on July 29, 2015:<br/><br/>Beautiful work Kim. It will follow on perfectly from Maj's as you answered the GIverny question. I am so pleased with the quality of responses so far.<br/><br/>ocfireflies from North Carolina on July 29, 2015:<br/><br/>John,<br/><br/>I had sent this earlier before travmaj's awesome contribution, but maybe it still works (I did a little tweaking)<br/><br/>following as opposed to prior--don't know if<br/><br/>I am making any sense.

Le but principal de ce type de poésie est de créer des poèmes à travers la collaboration de divers auteurs / poètes, en essayant de former une voix unifiée tout en conservant leurs voix individuelles.<br/><br/>Les exemples de collaboration abondent dans la poésie japonaise. Bien que les récits et les enregistrements précis de nombreux événements de ce type soient perdus ou manquants.<br/><br/>L'un des exemples les plus célèbres d'écriture collective de poésie a été le recueil de poèmes intitulé Ralentir Travaux des poètes français surréalistes André Breton, Paul Éluard et René Char. Ces trois poètes ont collaboré pour écrire les poèmes de ce recueil en seulement cinq jours en 1930.<br/><br/>Au cours des années 1940, Charles Henri Ford, un poète américain, a inventé ce qu'il a appelé le «poème en chaîne», où chaque poète a écrit une ligne, puis a envoyé le poème à une autre personne (pour continuer) dans une autre partie du monde, par la poste.<br/><br/>En 2007, un recueil de poésie collaborative américaine Saints of Hysteria: A Half-Century of Collaborative American Poetry a été édité et publié par Denise Duhamel, Maureen Seaton et David Trinidad.<br/><br/>L'écriture de poésie collaborative a été utilisée dans les écoles et les collèges pour enseigner aux étudiants le travail d'équipe et pour découvrir les façons dont ils sont connectés.<br/><br/>Étude d'une figure à l'extérieur: femme avec un parasol, face à gauche, 1886<br/><br/>Claude Monet [domaine public ou domaine public], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>Le but de cet article et comment relever le défi<br/><br/>Il y a quelques années, j'ai écrit un article intitulé "Poème sans fin" qui comprenait un poème de Noël que j'avais écrit et qui se prêtait à être ajouté. J'ai été étonné par la réponse car à ce stade, je n'avais que quelques adeptes ici. Les gens ont écrit une strophe de poésie chacun dans des «commentaires» sur le hub pour faire suite à la strophe du commentateur précédent. Cela a très bien fonctionné et à la fin, j'ai compilé toutes les contributions dans un seul poème dans le cadre du hub.<br/><br/>Des défis similaires ont été lancés depuis, dont un par Frank Atanacio appelé « Spirits Sat as Mourners » qui a également été très réussi. La différence étant que dans ce cas, les contributeurs ont écrit leurs propres hubs pour leur strophe de poésie et ont placé un lien sur le hub original de Frank.<br/><br/>Pour ce défi particulier, je ne m'attends pas à ce que tout le monde passe un temps précieux à écrire des hubs séparés pour une strophe de poésie (à moins que vous ne le vouliez vraiment). Le principal problème étant que pour le rendre efficace, vous devrez copier les parties du poème précédemment écrites sur votre hub et serait probablement frappé avec l'étiquette "duplication".<br/><br/>Donc, cela étant le cas, et aussi pour éviter d'avoir à laisser des liens partout, je demande simplement à tous ceux qui veulent participer d'écrire leur strophe ici dans "commentaires". Vérifiez le dernier commentaire avant le vôtre qui contribue au défi et continuez. Si je vois plus d'un suivant de la même strophe, j'utiliserai ma licence poétique pour les travailler comme je le juge le mieux.<br/><br/>À un moment où je sens qu’il y a eu suffisamment de strophes ajoutées, je vais probablement mettre fin au défi et les compiler tous ensemble comme le poème terminé dans le cadre de l’article (en donnant également crédit à chaque contributeur).<br/><br/>Flowered Riverbank, Argenteuil<br/><br/>Claude Monet [Domaine public], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>Le défi !<br/><br/>Maintenant vient la partie intéressante. Si vous rejoignez ce défi de poésie en chaîne, vous devez essayer de garder le style et la voix du poème aussi proche que possible des versets précédents, de sorte que pour les lecteurs mal informés, il apparaîtra qu'un seul auteur a écrit le poème entier.<br/><br/>Cela semble facile, vous dites? Eh bien, ce serait peut-être si le poème avait un style traditionnel, rime ou mètre. Mais celui-ci ne le fait pas! Le poème que vous ajouterez a été commencé par une de mes connaissances Andriealphus comme un "défi poème en chaîne" ailleurs. Au moment d’écrire ces lignes, j’étais la seule autre personne à avoir accepté le défi, et parce que j’aimais le sujet, j’ai pensé que ce serait un grand défi pour mes collègues écrivains et j’ai décidé de l’utiliser ici et de voir si la réponse serait meilleure. (Je connais quelques poètes ici dont l'écriture conviendrait à ce style)<br/><br/>Règles :<br/><br/>Suivez la strophe précédente dans les commentaires<br/><br/>Essayez de conserver la voix et le style du poème<br/><br/>Gardez votre strophe / vers à peu près la même longueur que ceux avant<br/><br/>Claude Monet est l'un des peintres les plus célèbres de l'histoire de l'art et une figure de proue du mouvement impressionniste.<br/><br/>En 1883, Monet s’installe à Giverny, où il aime peindre en plein air dans les jardins qu’il a contribué à créer. Les nénuphars trouvés dans l'étang avaient un attrait particulier, et il en a peint plusieurs séries tout au long de sa vie; le pont de style japonais au-dessus de l'étang est également devenu l'objet de plusieurs travaux.<br/><br/>En 1912, Monet peint une série de 12 peintures au nénuphar commandées par l'Orangerie des Tuileries, un musée parisien, qu'il choisit de réaliser à très grande échelle, et de servir de « havre de méditation paisible ». Ce projet a consommé une grande partie des dernières années de Monet. Monet a déclaré un jour, "Ces paysages d'eau et de réflexion sont devenus une obsession pour moi. Il est au-delà de ma force en tant que vieil homme, et pourtant je veux rendre ce que je ressens."<br/><br/>Presque aveugle, ses deux yeux gravement atteints de cataracte, Monet accepte finalement de subir une intervention chirurgicale pour la maladie en 1923.<br/><br/>Les célèbres nénuphars de Monet sont devenus plus rouges au fur et à mesure que ses cataractes progressaient. Après avoir subi une chirurgie corrective, il a détruit la plupart des peintures de nénuphars rouges, en colère que personne ne lui en ait vraiment parlé. Ironiquement, ces peintures étaient probablement ce qui a rendu son style impressionniste si célèbre à cette époque - les artistes ont commencé à prendre plus de risques avec la couleur et ainsi de suite pendant ce point.<br/><br/>Le chef-d'œuvre<br/><br/>Le garçon assis derrière vous dit que vous ressemblez à un chef-d'œuvre.<br/><br/>Demandez-lui, a-t-il déjà vu un Monet de près ?<br/><br/>Assez proche pour ne voir que des coups de mauvaises herbes au bord du lac?<br/><br/>Suffisamment proche pour plonger ses doigts dans les crêtes<br/><br/>où les peintures à l'huile durcies sous le regard d'un artiste?<br/><br/>Assez près pour respirer sur les lys de sang?<br/><br/>Demandez-lui, pourquoi les a-t-il peints en rouge ? » (Andriealphus)<br/><br/>Il rit comme le chat Cheshire de Carroll.<br/><br/>"A travers des yeux embrumés et injectés de sang, j'imagine.<br/><br/>Sois mes nénuphars ! » dit-il,<br/><br/>Ressentez mon souffle et laissez mes doigts plonger,<br/><br/>C’est devenu mon chef-d’œuvre.<br/><br/>Un pinceau n'a jamais touché une toile aussi fine que votre peau claire.<br/><br/>Que les maîtres pleurent de jalousie,<br/><br/>et Van Gogh se coupe l'oreille en envie devant la beauté de ta nudité."<br/><br/>Autoportrait avec oreille bandée<br/><br/>Vincent van Gogh [Domaine public], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>Réponses<br/><br/>Maintenant, c'est à votre tour. S'il vous plaît écrire votre réponse dans les commentaires ci-dessous, en vous souvenant de vérifier ceux immédiatement avant le vôtre pour la dernière strophe écrite du poème. Si vous décidez d'écrire un hub séparé pour votre strophe de vers, assurez-vous de laisser un lien ici dans les commentaires.<br/><br/>Le chef-d'œuvre terminé<br/><br/>Toutes les contributions ont été reçues et j'ai mis le poème fini avec seulement quelques modifications légères. J'espère que tout le monde est satisfait du résultat. Si vous pensez que je pourrais améliorer l'ordre des strophes, etc., n'hésitez pas à me le faire savoir.<br/><br/>Observations<br/><br/>Hey Diana, on dirait que je dois ajouter une autre strophe au poème fini :)<br/><br/>Merci pour cette contribution.<br/><br/>Diana L Pierce de Potter County, Pa. le 19 septembre 2015:<br/><br/>Pas de larmes éclaboussent l'eau ci-dessous,<br/><br/>Du pont sous ses pieds,<br/><br/>Ni son pinceau peindre ses pensées,<br/><br/>De la servante mystérieuse qu'il cherche.<br/><br/>John Hansen (auteur) de Gondwana Land le 21 août 2015 :<br/><br/>Merci Cris, je suis sûr que tout le monde apprécie votre commentaire. Maintenant, vous devez consulter le poème final / compilation dans "The Finished Masterpiece".<br/><br/>CrisSp de Sky Is The Limit Adventure le 21 août 2015 :<br/><br/>Maintenant, c'est un chef-d'œuvre! Une idée brillante. Un travail génial.<br/><br/>John Hansen (auteur) de Gondwana Land le 14 août 2015 :<br/><br/>Tout est fait, allez le vérifier. (voir le lien ci-dessus commentaires)<br/><br/>John Hansen (auteur) de Gondwana Land le 14 août 2015 :<br/><br/>Salut Jo, très bien fait. Merci d'avoir participé :) votre strophe raconte une grande histoire en quelques mots. Je vais prendre plaisir à l'ajouter.<br/><br/>Ann Carr de SW England le 14 août 2015:<br/><br/>J'aime beaucoup le poème de Jo, intriguant.<br/><br/>Ann<br/><br/>Jo_Goldsmith11 le 14 août 2015:<br/><br/>Bonjour! Voilà. Merci pour l'invitation. J'espère que vous aimez ça? :-)<br/><br/>**************************<br/><br/>Il commence à marcher vers la peinture multicolore<br/><br/>Des bleus vifs de toutes les nuances entrent en scène<br/><br/>C'est tout ce qu'il peut voir à travers ses yeux de cataracte<br/><br/>Une femme avec la robe de dentelle et de diamants<br/><br/>Elle cherche ses pensées<br/><br/>Rouges et verts tissent à travers son cerveau et une révélation donne naissance<br/><br/>Le voyage sur cette route de réalisations qu'il a fait<br/><br/>La dame disparaît à travers la canopée des arbres devant<br/><br/>Il est de nouveau seul, debout là avec un pinceau et une toile vide<br/><br/>Ruby Jean Richert de Southern Illinois le 14 août 2015:<br/><br/>Je n'ai pas pu résister.

J'ai une idée où le placer dans le poème. Restez à l'écoute.<br/><br/>John Hansen (auteur) de Gondwana Land le 12 août 2015 :<br/><br/>Merci Audrey.<br/><br/>John Hansen (auteur) de Gondwana Land le 12 août 2015 :<br/><br/>Jo, merci d'avoir commenté si gentiment et de m'avoir fait savoir que vous avez l'intention de contribuer.

Et la beauté que nous pouvons encore profiter aujourd'hui de toute son œuvre.<br/><br/>C'est un grand défi! Je suis vraiment impatient d'ajouter à cela.<br/><br/>Je voulais d'abord m'arrêter et vous le faire savoir, c'est certain.<br/><br/>Et merci beaucoup pour tous les défis pour aider le reste d'entre nous, garder notre énergie mentale et lui donner un travail! Vous êtes le meilleur.<br/><br/>L'information sur LuLu et le numéro ISBN gratuit est une prière répondue! Alors, souriez mon ami. Vous êtes un cadeau!<br/><br/>Hugs. :-)<br/><br/>John Hansen (auteur) de Gondwana Land le 12 août 2015 :<br/><br/>Salut encore Marj. Je pense que j'ai peut-être tous les versets qui vont venir. J'ai fait de mon mieux pour les organiser comme je le pense le mieux avec juste un peu d'édition. Je vais probablement poster le poème fini comme un hub séparé avec un lien sur celui-ci. Mon livre est disponible sur Lulu et iBooks... il y a un lien sur l'un des commentaires précédents. J'apprécierais vraiment que vous en fassiez une copie. Gardez à l'esprit que c'est mon premier eBook, donc le formatage, etc. n'est pas parfait, mais il m'a fallu sept révisions je pense pour l'obtenir là où il est. Tout sera plus facile la prochaine fois. Si vous avez besoin d'aide, faites-le moi savoir.<br/><br/>Travmaj d'Australie le 12 août 2015:<br/><br/>Salut John, vous avez certainement eu d'excellentes réponses à votre défi - je suis sûr que vous le fusionnerez tout à fait magnifiquement bien que j'imagine une tâche difficile. Je suis intéressé par vos livres de poésie aussi - je dois vraiment obtenir mon acte ensemble technologiquement - je vais essayer de vérifier tout cela ...<br/><br/>John Hansen (auteur) de Gondwana Land le 11 août 2015 :<br/><br/>Salut Jo, les deux livres 'On the Wings of Eagles' et "I Laughed a Smile" ont la plupart du temps le même contenu... sauf le premier a un poème supplémentaire. A l'origine ils étaient dans différents formats, un ePub, l'autre PDF mais maintenant ils sont tous les deux ePub. Ils sont disponibles via Lulu et iBooks, bientôt Barnes et Noble et Nook (pas Amazon). Je peux essayer de publier un autre livre via Amazon bientôt juste pour voir comment il se compare. Merci encore.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues de Lincolnshire, Royaume-Uni le 11 août 2015:<br/><br/>John, merci beaucoup, l'info sur l'édition avec Lulu sera très utile car je pense à l'édition mais je suis actuellement déchiré entre Amazon et Lulu. Je voulais acheter un de vos livres, mais je n'ai pas l'air de les trouver sur Amazon. Cependant, je vais probablement l'obtenir de Lulu. En vous souhaitant tout le succès, vous le méritez.<br/><br/>John Hansen (auteur) de Gondwana Land le 11 août 2015 :<br/><br/>Hey Phyllis, merci pour l'attribution. J'aime ça, une fin parfaite au poème je pense.<br/><br/>John Hansen (auteur) de Gondwana Land le 11 août 2015 :<br/><br/>Merci Faith.<br/><br/>John Hansen (auteur) de Gondwana Land le 11 août 2015 :<br/><br/>Salut Jo, je pense que j'ai trié le poème de manière satisfaisante. J'attends de voir s'il y a plus à ajouter. Publier avec Lulu n'était pas mal et maintenant que je l'ai fait une fois, ce sera plus facile la prochaine fois. Obtenir le formatage pour regarder droit dans le livre électronique a été le plus difficile, bien que vous et juste le taper dans un document Word et Lulu produit automatiquement la page de contenu et convertit le document en ePub ou PDF, vous ne pouvez utiliser certaines polices et devez vous assurer que les noms de chapitre ou les titres de poème sont dans la rubrique 1. Ils fournissent également un numéro ISBN gratuit si vous le souhaitez. Dans l'ensemble, c'était plus facile que prévu cependant.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues de Lincolnshire, Royaume-Uni le 11 août 2015:<br/><br/>Phyllis, c'est succinct et beau, j'adore. Shyron a fait un excellent travail aussi, je pensais que j'avais déjà commenté son verset, mais je ne l'avais pas fait.<br/><br/>Phyllis Doyle Burns du haut désert du Nevada. le 10 août 2015:<br/><br/>Merveilleux moyeu, grande idée, Jodah. En voici un de moi. Court mais doux. J'espère que tout va bien:<br/><br/>Et que la beauté soit<br/><br/>Du passé des Maîtres nous voyons<br/><br/>Impressionné par le garçon<br/><br/>Digne d'elle de joie<br/><br/>Faith Reaper du sud des États-Unis le 10 août 2015:<br/><br/>Merci John et Jo. Vous êtes gentil. Jo, vous avez toujours été un poète brillant. Moi aussi, j'attends avec impatience le résultat final après que John fasse sa magie pour tout rassembler.<br/><br/>Je vais partager à nouveau pour voir s'il y a d'autres preneurs.<br/><br/>Bénédictions<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues de Lincolnshire, Royaume-Uni le 10 août 2015:<br/><br/>La foi, magnifiquement faite, je trouve incroyable comment quelqu'un avec une vision aussi limitée peut nous apprendre tant de choses sur la beauté, la lumière et les ombres. John, impatient de lire le résultat final.<br/><br/>Au fait, congtats sur la publication de vos poèmes. Comment avez-vous trouvé le processus de publication avec Lulu?<br/><br/>John Hansen (auteur) de Gondwana Land le 10 août 2015 :<br/><br/>Non, il n'est pas trop tard, je suis toujours en train de compiler le poème final, donc il devrait être à la disposition de tous dans un jour ou deux.<br/><br/>Faith Reaper du sud des États-Unis le 10 août 2015:<br/><br/>Bonjour John,<br/><br/>Je m'excuse pour ma soumission tardive ici à votre merveilleux défi. Je suis en congé du travail un jour ou deux et j'ai décidé d'essayer pendant que mon mari se repose d'une chirurgie du genou. S'il ne répond pas à vos normes, n'hésitez pas à ne pas l'utiliser dans votre poème final ou éditer comme vous le jugez nécessaire.<br/><br/>Bénédictions toujours<br/><br/>Et voilà :<br/><br/>Confessions à un ami Georges Clemenceau<br/><br/>De lumière encapsulant à la fois le tourment, la joie<br/><br/>Fervent folie dans l'analyse des couleurs<br/><br/>Créations spontanées conséquentes<br/><br/>Saison après saison de l'obsession<br/><br/>Capturer différentes teintes en un seul instant<br/><br/>Attentif tout en se promenant à Argenteuill<br/><br/>Brushwork met à nu le chef-d'œuvre.<br/><br/>John Hansen (auteur) de Gondwana Land le 9 août 2015 :<br/><br/>Juste un cri pour voir si quelqu'un d'autre veut encore contribuer à ce poème en chaîne. J'ai commencé à compiler les strophes ensemble, mais je le laisserai ouvert pendant quelques jours au cas où quelqu'un d'autre aurait l'intention de participer. Merci à tous ceux qui ont contribué.<br/><br/>John Hansen (auteur) de Gondwana Land le 2 août 2015 :<br/><br/>Merci Genna. Il semble Monet est un arist favori de beaucoup ici. J'espère que vous prendrez part à ce défi aussi :)<br/><br/>John Hansen (auteur) de Gondwana Land le 2 août 2015 :<br/><br/>Merci pour une grande contribution Shyron. C'est un très beau verset. Bravo.<br/><br/>Genna East de Massachusetts, USA le 2 août 2015:<br/><br/>Bonsoir John...<br/><br/>J'ai commencé à lire ce merveilleux défi (Monet est l'un de mes artistes préférés), puis je suis revenu pour terminer la lecture de certaines des belles contributions qui donnent à cette peinture une voix étonnante à travers la perception et les sens.<br/><br/>Shyron E Shenko du Texas le 02 août 2015:<br/><br/>Suivre Jo (tobusiness)<br/><br/>"Le blanc pur de la peau du lis<br/><br/>Ne parle pas de beauté de l'intérieur<br/><br/>Juste la voie ou le but de Monet<br/><br/>Pour les yeux festoyants<br/><br/>Ne pas manger pour l’âme »<br/><br/>Shyron<br/><br/>John Hansen (auteur) de Gondwana Land le 2 août 2015 :<br/><br/>Merci pour votre retour Kim, je suis tellement heureux avec les réponses. Juste donné à attendre et voir s'il ya plus.<br/><br/>ocfireflies de Caroline du Nord le 02 août 2015:<br/><br/>John,<br/><br/>Tellement heureux à chaque fois que je reviens voir un autre maillon de cette chaîne poétique, et Wow, Jo ne lui rend jamais justice.<br/><br/>Kim<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues de Lincolnshire, Royaume-Uni le 2 août 2015:<br/><br/>Salut John, 'sublime' fera bien. Je suis tellement heureux que vous aimez ma contribution. C'est une très bonne idée, je sais que vous aurez du plaisir à tout mettre ensemble. Prenez soin de vous et de mon mieux pour vous.<br/><br/>John Hansen (auteur) de Gondwana Land le 1 août 2015 :<br/><br/>Merci Deb, oui je suis impressionné par le niveau de soumissions. Je suis impatient de tout mettre ensemble.<br/><br/>John Hansen (auteur) de Gondwana Land le 1 août 2015 :<br/><br/>Oui Ann, il est bon de voir les poètes parmi nous relever le défi avec de grandes contributions jusqu'à présent. J'espère juste qu'Imcan lui fera justice quand il s'agit de le mettre ensemble.<br/><br/>John Hansen (auteur) de Gondwana Land le 1 août 2015 :<br/><br/>Bravo Jo. Le mot "sublime" me vient à l'esprit. J'espérais que tous les poètes se lèveraient à l'avant, et ils l'ont fait. Aimez-le, merci d'avoir contribué.<br/><br/>Deb Hirt de Stillwater, OK le 1 août 2015:<br/><br/>J'ai hâte de voir ce que vous allez trouver ici. Il y a un certain nombre de beaux poètes qui relèvent le défi, alors allez-y!<br/><br/>Ann Carr de SW England le 01 août 2015:<br/><br/>Super, Jo !<br/><br/>Tu as tout le monde, John ! Plutôt toi que moi, en train de mettre tout ça ensemble, mais ça va être un fredonneur d'un poème quand ça arrivera enfin à sa fin - si jamais ça arrive !<br/><br/>Ann<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues de Lincolnshire, Royaume-Uni le 1 août 2015:<br/><br/>Ok, John ici ne va rien! Suivant de Kim. J'espère qu'il lit bien.<br/><br/>Et le garçon commença à s'éloigner<br/><br/>Mais dans son sillage, je l'ai entendu dire<br/><br/>"J'ai fait un voyage à Orangerie<br/><br/>Là où le fantôme de Monet demeure encore<br/><br/>Je me suis assis et j'ai regardé un moment<br/><br/>Jusqu'à ce que j'entende une voix douce pleurer.<br/><br/>Avez-vous déjà vu un rêve fluide?<br/><br/>Où la lumière évolue en ce qu’elle touche<br/><br/>Où la sérénité coule à travers le voile nuageux<br/><br/>Où le pinceau du magicien comme éclairant se précipite<br/><br/>Avez-vous déjà vu une vue sublime?<br/><br/>Un enfant né d’une illusion déformée<br/><br/>Cet étang fleuri qui emprisonne la lumière<br/><br/>Qui soulève le cœur et appelle l'âme<br/><br/>Une pulchritude abstraite de près<br/><br/>Reculez, voyez, un tel délice tranquille. »<br/><br/>J'espère que cela correspond à ce que les autres ont fait. N'hésitez pas à éditer si nécessaire. Mon meilleur...<br/><br/>Jo.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues de Lincolnshire, Royaume-Uni le 1 août 2015:<br/><br/>Très bien !<br/><br/>John Hansen (auteur) de Gondwana Land le 1 août 2015 :<br/><br/>Oui Jo, s'il vous plaît. N'importe qui est invité à faire plus d'une strophe. Je peux en ajouter une autre moi-même à un moment donné.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues de Lincolnshire, Royaume-Uni le 1 août 2015:<br/><br/>John, j'ai décidé de faire un essai, mais c'est environ 16 lignes, puis-je le faire en deux strophes suite à la merveilleuse soumission de Kim? Vous pouvez toujours le modifier plus tard.<br/><br/>John Hansen (auteur) de Gondwana Land le 31 juillet 2015 :<br/><br/>Salut Jo, désolé d'apprendre que vous êtes sous le temps en ce moment. Je ne suis pas pressé de clôturer ce défi donc je vais le garder ouvert jusqu'à ce que vous soyez de nouveau en train de tirer sur tous les cylindres et que vous soyez en mesure de contribuer. Vous êtes l'un des hubbers que j'attendais avec impatience d'obtenir une réponse de ce que je pensais que cela conviendrait. Merci pour vos gentils mots, et se rétablir bientôt.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues de Lincolnshire, Royaume-Uni le 31 juillet 2015:<br/><br/>Wow! John Je ne peux pas croire que j'ai manqué votre incroyable défi. C'est quelque chose dans lequel j'aurais aimé participer puisque Claude Monet est l'un de mes artistes préférés de tous les temps. Malheureusement, je dois pleurer. Je suis un peu sous le temps avec une tête pleine de coton, ou du moins c'est ce qu'il semble. Si le défi est encore ouvert quand je me débarrasse de cette grippe embêtante, je peux l'essayer, mais je dois dire que la norme est exceptionnellement élevée. Maj a pris à un autre niveau, mais toutes les soumissions sont brillantes. Félicitations à vous Andriealphus et les autres écrivains qui ont participé jusqu'à présent à ce chef-d'œuvre artistique et créatif.<br/><br/>Mon meilleur toujours Jo.<br/><br/>John Hansen (auteur) de Gondwana Land le 31 juillet 2015 :<br/><br/>Salut encore Maj, heureux que ce poème vous a inspiré, et oui il bat regarder le cricket surtout avec les batteurs australiens performants mal dans ce troisième test. Ce sera un exercice intéressant pour moi de fusionner toutes les strophes ensemble mais devrait être bon.<br/><br/>travmaj de australia le 30 juillet 2015:<br/><br/>John, merci, je suis très heureux que tu aimes mon offrande. J'ai trouvé le poème intrigant et tout à coup je me suis senti inspiré pour écrire ma version dans le même mode. Je ne suis pas sûr d'avoir écrit une suite de la strophe avant (toujours explorer), mais je suis sûr que vous allez le fusionner complètement le moment venu. Aimer toutes les réponses. Je n'ai pas réussi toute écriture créative pour yonks, ne peut pas attendre maintenant pour recommencer, juste besoin de temps. (beats regarder le cricket aussi !!!)<br/><br/>John Hansen (auteur) de Gondwana Land le 30 juillet 2015 :<br/><br/>Merci de vérifier Dana. Je suis satisfait de la qualité des réponses jusqu'à présent. Je dois juste attendre et voir combien d'autres entrent. Le poème final devrait être génial.<br/><br/>Dana Tate de LOS ANGELES le 30 juillet 2015:<br/><br/>Juste vérifier pour voir comment les choses vont, je ne peux pas attendre pour le produit fini. J'ai assisté à un cours de poésie et nous avons fait cela aussi c'était vraiment amusant.<br/><br/>ocfireflies de Caroline du Nord le 29 juillet 2015:<br/><br/>John,<br/><br/>Merci beaucoup d'avoir fourni la plate-forme pour sans qu'il soit facile de tomber.<br/><br/>; ) Kim<br/><br/>John Hansen (auteur) de Gondwana Land le 29 juillet 2015 :<br/><br/>Merci Devika, je ne t'ai pas vu depuis un moment, j'espère que tout va bien.<br/><br/>John Hansen (auteur) de Gondwana Land le 29 juillet 2015 :<br/><br/>Beau travail Kim. Il suivra parfaitement de Maj comme vous avez répondu à la question de Giverny. Je suis tellement heureux de la qualité des réponses jusqu'à présent.<br/><br/>ocfireflies de Caroline du Nord le 29 juillet 2015:<br/><br/>John,<br/><br/>J'avais envoyé ceci plus tôt avant la contribution géniale de travmaj, mais peut-être que cela fonctionne toujours (j'ai fait un peu de tweaking)<br/><br/>Contrairement à avant, je ne sais pas si<br/><br/>Je fais n'importe quel sens. Si cela ne fonctionne pas, s'il vous plaît n'hésitez pas à supprimer et je vais essayer à nouveau. |

| First of all EEQT itself needs to be further developed in order to provide a theoretical and computational answer to the needs of modern quantum engineering<br/>and technology. We need to include classical systems with infinite<br/>numbers of degrees of freedom - like electromagnetic and/or gravitational<br/>field. We also need to include infinite quantum systems so as<br/>to understand and simulate Bose gas and its phase transitions. But, there<br/>are also steps that must be taken far beyond the paradigm of EEQT.<br/>As we have emphasized so many times: quantum theory has yet<br/>to be understood in terms of a "non-linear classical theory." But what we mean by a "classical theory" is something much more advanced and more<br/>general than clasical mechanics or classical field theory. By a "classical theory" we mean first of all, a theory that is not based<br/>on probabilities from the start; a theory in which probabilities appear at a<br/>later stage, derived from the theory; derived perhaps, in a necessary way. Such a theory must not only specify the mathematical objects and their relations but also make "predictions".<br/>A classical theory is, in particular, a theory in which discrete events can happen, events that are "objective." They may be events that affect mainly the physical stratum, but they may be also "mental<br/>events," changes of states of "consciousness;" whatever they are, even if they<br/>are concerned with branchings of universes, - they DO HAPPEN.<br/>Such a theory, encompassing the quantum theory as we know it today,<br/>does not yet exist, but we can envisage its possible shape. Nothing serves better than an example, so let us give here an example of how<br/>such a theory can be construed.<br/>Imagine a theory developed a'la Einstein's unified field theory, but<br/>with variable metric signature, possibly with a complex causal web, multiple<br/>Einstein-Rosen [40] (see also [41]) bridges,<br/>time loops, nondifferrentiability, fractal structure, all of that additionally complicated by variable dimensionality of space and of "time" (cf [42]. Imagine such a theory to be able to accomodate all the four fundamental<br/>forces known to us, but it also involves an extra field, which is different<br/>from physical fields, and which is non-local in the sense that it does not<br/>survive taking a macro-average-limit when causal space-time<br/>structure of Einstein's general relativity is recovered. This extra field<br/>would be a place for "thought forms" and our theory would couple these<br/>thought forms to more "physical" levels of reality. The very concept of<br/>"time" would arise only in one particular limiting structure. Nothing<br/>prevents a theory of such a type to have mathematical structures rich enough to accomodate consciousness and mind. Due to its complexity,<br/>density of time-loops, bubble-like causal structure, making predictions<br/>in such theory is possible only by applying probability -<br/>as it is the case with systems evolving according to deterministic<br/>but chaotic dynamics. Quantum wave function would emerge in such a<br/>theory as an effective way of predicting. That type of explanation<br/>of quantum indeterminism was postulated long ago by I. J. Good. In<br/>[3] he speculated that<br/>quantum indeterminism can be understood if we admit that individual quantum events that actually happen here and now have future<br/>advanced causes as well has past retarded causes.<br/>A glimpse of such a thought<br/>may have occured to Alan Turing when he wrote his famous, already quoted sentence: "prediction must be linear, description must be nonlinear."<br/>A theory going partially in this direction is being developed by L. Nottale<br/>[43] who states the observation, attributed to Feynman, that "the typical paths of quantum mechanical particles are continuous non-differentiable." Then he continues his development of fractal<br/>space-time ideas to conclude with: "The quantum behavior becomes, in this theory,<br/>a manifestation of the fractal geometry of space-time, in the same way gravitation is, in Einstein's theory of general (motion-)relativity, a manifestation of the curvature of space-time.<br/>Another step in this direction comes from the work of Russian scientists - which started with the most original ideas of N.A. Kozyrev [44]<br/>and A. Sakharov [45], and is being developed in Moscow, the Urals and Siberia, see e.g. [46, 47, 48]. | Tout d'abord, l'EEQT lui-même doit être développé afin de fournir une réponse théorique et computationnelle aux besoins de l'ingénierie et de la technologie quantiques modernes. Nous devons inclure des systèmes classiques avec un nombre infini de degrés de liberté - comme le champ électromagnétique et / ou gravitationnel. Nous devons également inclure des systèmes quantiques infinis afin de comprendre et de simuler le gaz de Bose et ses transitions de phase. Mais, il y a aussi des mesures qui doivent être prises bien au-delà du paradigme de l'EEQT.<br/>Comme nous l'avons souligné tant de fois: la théorie quantique n'a pas encore été comprise en termes de "théorie classique non linéaire". Mais ce que nous entendons par une "théorie classique" est quelque chose de beaucoup plus avancé et plus général que la mécanique clasique ou la théorie classique des champs. Par "théorie classique", nous entendons tout d'abord une théorie qui n'est pas basée sur des probabilités dès le départ; une théorie dans laquelle les probabilités apparaissent à un stade ultérieur, dérivé de la théorie; dérivé peut-être, d'une manière nécessaire. Une telle théorie doit non seulement spécifier les objets mathématiques et leurs relations, mais aussi faire des "prédictions".<br/>Une théorie classique est, en particulier, une théorie dans laquelle des événements discrets peuvent se produire, des événements qui sont «objectifs». Ils peuvent être des événements qui affectent principalement la strate physique, mais ils peuvent aussi être des «événements mentaux», des changements d'états de «conscience»; quels qu'ils soient, même s'ils sont concernés par des ramifications d'univers, - ils arrivent.<br/>Une telle théorie, englobant la théorie quantique telle que nous la connaissons aujourd'hui, n'existe pas encore, mais nous pouvons envisager sa forme possible. Rien ne sert mieux qu'un exemple, alors donnons ici un exemple de la façon dont une telle théorie peut être interprétée.<br/>Imaginez qu'une théorie ait développé la théorie unifiée des champs d'Einstein, mais avec une signature métrique variable, peut-être avec un réseau causal complexe, multiple.<br/>Einstein-Rosen [40] (voir aussi [41]) ponts, boucles temporelles, non-diférenciabilité, structure fractale, tout cela en plus compliqué par la dimensionnalité variable de l'espace et du "temps" (cf [42]. Imaginez qu'une telle théorie soit capable d'accommoder les quatre forces fondamentales connues de nous, mais elle implique aussi un champ supplémentaire, qui est différent des champs physiques, et qui n'est pas local en ce sens qu'il ne survit pas en prenant une macro-moyenne-limite lorsque la structure causale espace-temps de la relativité générale d'Einstein est récupérée. Ce champ supplémentaire serait un lieu pour les "formes de pensée" et notre théorie couplerait ces formes de pensée à des niveaux plus "physiques" de la réalité.<br/>Rien n'empêche une théorie d'un tel type d'avoir des structures mathématiques assez riches pour accueillir la conscience et l'esprit. En raison de sa complexité, de la densité des boucles temporelles, de la structure causale en forme de bulle, faire des prédictions dans une telle théorie n'est possible qu'en appliquant la probabilité -<br/>comme c'est le cas avec des systèmes évoluant selon des dynamiques déterministes mais chaotiques. La fonction d'onde quantique émergerait dans une telle théorie comme un moyen efficace de prédire. Ce type d'explication de l'indéterminisme quantique a été postulé il y a longtemps par I. J. Good.<br/>Il a spéculé que l'indéterminisme quantique peut être compris si nous admettons que les événements quantiques individuels qui se produisent réellement ici et maintenant ont également des causes avancées dans le passé.<br/>Alan Turing a peut-être eu un aperçu d'une telle pensée quand il a écrit sa phrase célèbre, déjà citée: "la prédiction doit être linéaire, la description doit être non linéaire."<br/>Une théorie allant partiellement dans cette direction est en cours de développement par L. Nottale<br/>[43] qui déclare l’observation, attribuée à Feynman, que « les chemins typiques des particules de mécanique quantique sont continus non-différenciables ». Le comportement quantique devient, dans cette théorie, une manifestation de la géométrie fractale de l'espace-temps, de la même manière que la gravitation est, dans la théorie d'Einstein de la (motion-)relativité générale, une manifestation de la courbure de l'espace-temps.<br/>Un autre pas dans cette direction vient des travaux des scientifiques russes - qui ont commencé avec les idées les plus originales de N.A. Kozyrev [44]<br/>et A. Sakharov [45], et se développe à Moscou, dans l'Oural et en Sibérie, voir par exemple [46, 47, 48]. |
| Best Nutrition And Exercise For Lose Weight<br/><br/>How is breakfast really healthy?<br/><br/>In the morning like an emperor, at noon like a king, in the evening like a beggar – goes a well-known proverb. A study by the medical organization Endocrine Society confirms the key message behind the saying: It shows that breakfast plays a more important role than is often assumed. In the morning, the human body actually has more than twice as high a metabolic activity as at other times of the day: A large breakfast not only keeps you full for a long time, blood sugar and insulin levels also rise slowly. The appetite for sweets is regulated, we eat snacks less often during the day. Therefore, breakfast should not be skipped even during a diet.<br/><br/>Of course, having a big breakfast doesn't mean that we should have several croissants with nut nougat cream and sweet breakfast pancakes in the morning. Breakfast is healthy best when it is high in protein and fiber, as well as providing vitamins and minerals. Whole grain bread or muesli, oat flakes, fruits and nuts are energy suppliers that are good for you and keep you full for a long time.<br/><br/>The fact that a large breakfast is better than a large dinner does not necessarily mean that breakfast is essential for losing weight. A meta-analysis carried out in 2019 showed, that the total daily energy intake of people who eat breakfast is on average higher, than that of those who do not have breakfast. The latter were on average just under half a kilo lighter. So, according to the results of this major study, you don't necessarily have to eat breakfast if you want to lose weight.<br/><br/>Lose weight with the right diet – that's how easy it is to put healthy on your plate<br/><br/>Eating healthy in no way means less taste. Fresh vegetables, fish or meat as protein sources and other healthy ingredients conjure up taste in the pot and a smile on your lips – ideally also when you step on the scales. A US study has shown that people who cook their own food and consciously deal with what they eat have a body mass index in the normal range. Restaurant visits or fast food, on the other hand, quickly lure you into the sugar trap: Often there is no indication of how much sugar is in salad dressings, how much fat the potatoes were fried in or whether the meat was not treated.<br/><br/>A healthy lunch consists of three parts – the largest part is fruits or vegetables and should cover half of the plate. A quarter of the meal should consist of protein, i.e. fish, meat or tofu. The remaining quarter consists of carbohydrates and is ideally made from whole grain products. Important: Don't eat at your desk in the office, but stimulate your metabolism and ideally take a short walk before or after lunch.<br/><br/>When should you eat to lose weight?<br/><br/>In the evening, you should focus on light meals that are rather low in carbohydrates. These are the least likely to cause insulin to skyrocket, which is good for our body. Vegetables, dairy products and nuts, for example, are well suited for this.<br/><br/>You should also be careful not to have dinner too late. It is best to have eaten until 7 p.m. – then the body can relax and prepare for the night. Sufficient sleep is important for healthy weight loss. A US study found that people who slept about eight hours a night had better fat deposits. So good night! Allow yourself more than six hours of sleep so that you can start the next day fit and refreshed.<br/><br/>Losing weight without exercise – is it really possible?<br/><br/>It would be so easy, if the dream weight could be achieved simply by lowering the calorie intake. But you probably know the wisdom that diet is only one side of the coin and exercise is the other. So nothing helps: Put on your sportswear and off you go!<br/><br/>Anyone who, in addition to the sports program such as jogging, walking or swimming, also lets the elevator go alone and takes the stairs, takes a little detour or uses the bike instead of the car, is doing wellis also called something good. Even simple walking is good for health. | Meilleure nutrition et exercice pour perdre du poids<br/><br/>Comment le petit déjeuner est-il vraiment sain?<br/><br/>Le matin comme un empereur, à midi comme un roi, le soir comme un mendiant, dit un proverbe bien connu. Une étude de l'organisation médicale Endocrine Society confirme le message clé derrière le dicton: Il montre que le petit-déjeuner joue un rôle plus important que ce qui est souvent supposé. Le matin, le corps humain a en fait plus de deux fois plus d’activité métabolique qu’à d’autres moments de la journée: un petit-déjeuner copieux vous permet non seulement de rester rassasié pendant longtemps, mais le taux de sucre dans le sang et d’insuline augmente également lentement. L'appétit pour les bonbons est réglementé, nous mangeons des collations moins souvent pendant la journée. Par conséquent, le petit-déjeuner ne doit pas être sauté même pendant un régime.<br/><br/>Bien sûr, prendre un gros petit-déjeuner ne signifie pas que nous devrions avoir plusieurs croissants avec de la crème de nougat aux noix et des crêpes sucrées le matin. Le petit-déjeuner est meilleur pour la santé lorsqu'il est riche en protéines et en fibres, en plus de fournir des vitamines et des minéraux. Pain à grains entiers ou muesli, flocons d'avoine, fruits et noix sont des fournisseurs d'énergie qui sont bons pour vous et vous gardent rassasié pendant longtemps.<br/><br/>Le fait qu’un grand petit-déjeuner soit meilleur qu’un grand dîner ne signifie pas nécessairement que le petit-déjeuner est essentiel pour perdre du poids. Une méta-analyse réalisée en 2019 a montré que l’apport énergétique quotidien total des personnes qui prennent leur petit-déjeuner est en moyenne supérieur à celui de celles qui ne prennent pas de petit-déjeuner, ces dernières étant en moyenne un peu moins d’un demi-kilo plus légères. Donc, selon les résultats de cette étude majeure, vous n'avez pas nécessairement à prendre le petit déjeuner si vous voulez perdre du poids.<br/><br/>Perdre du poids avec le bon régime - c'est comme ça qu'il est facile de mettre sain dans votre assiette<br/><br/>Les légumes frais, le poisson ou la viande comme sources de protéines et d’autres ingrédients sains évoquent le goût dans la casserole et un sourire sur les lèvres – idéalement aussi lorsque vous marchez sur la balance. Une étude américaine a montré que les personnes qui cuisinent leur propre nourriture et font consciemment face à ce qu’elles mangent ont un indice de masse corporelle dans la fourchette normale. Les visites au restaurant ou à la restauration rapide, d'autre part, vous attirent rapidement dans le piège à sucre: Souvent, il n'y a aucune indication de la quantité de sucre dans les vinaigrettes, de la quantité de graisse dans laquelle les pommes de terre ont été frites ou si la viande n'a pas été traitée.<br/><br/>Un déjeuner sain se compose de trois parties – la plus grande partie est constituée de fruits ou de légumes et doit couvrir la moitié de l’assiette. Un quart du repas doit être composé de protéines, c’est-à-dire de poisson, de viande ou de tofu. Le quart restant se compose de glucides et est idéalement fabriqué à partir de produits de grains entiers. Important: Ne mangez pas à votre bureau au bureau, mais stimulez votre métabolisme et idéalement faites une courte promenade avant ou après le déjeuner.<br/><br/>Quand devriez-vous manger pour perdre du poids?<br/><br/>Dans la soirée, vous devriez vous concentrer sur les repas légers qui sont plutôt faibles en glucides. Ceux-ci sont les moins susceptibles de faire monter en flèche l'insuline, ce qui est bon pour notre corps. Les légumes, les produits laitiers et les noix, par exemple, sont bien adaptés à cela.<br/><br/>Vous devez également faire attention à ne pas dîner trop tard. Il est préférable d'avoir mangé jusqu'à 19 heures - alors le corps peut se détendre et se préparer pour la nuit. Un sommeil suffisant est important pour une perte de poids saine. Une étude américaine a révélé que les personnes qui dormaient environ huit heures par nuit avaient de meilleurs dépôts de graisse. Alors bonne nuit! Accordez-vous plus de six heures de sommeil afin que vous puissiez commencer le lendemain en forme et rafraîchi.<br/><br/>Perdre du poids sans exercice – est-ce vraiment possible?<br/><br/>Il serait si facile, si le poids de rêve pourrait être atteint simplement en abaissant l'apport calorique. Mais vous savez probablement la sagesse que l'alimentation est seulement un côté de la médaille et l'exercice est l'autre. Donc rien n'aide: Mettez vos vêtements de sport et vous partez!<br/><br/>Toute personne qui, en plus du programme sportif comme le jogging, la marche ou la natation, laisse également l'ascenseur aller seul et prend les escaliers, fait un petit détour ou utilise le vélo à la place de la voiture, fait bien est aussi appelé quelque chose de bien. Même la marche simple est bonne pour la santé. |
| Why We Open Sourced the Anvil App Server<br/><br/>Why Open Source?<br/><br/>A little while ago, we open-sourced the Anvil App Server. The community reaction has been great, even a little overwhelming (yes, every reply to that announcement really did land in my inbox!). We've already incorporated a bunch of that feedback into our version 1.2 release. But we keep getting asked, " Why did you open-source such a core part of your product? "<br/><br/>Why do this at all?<br/><br/>Anvil is a tool that makes it as simple as possible to build a web app. We do that by enabling you to build the whole application in one language, Python.<br/><br/>Simple hosting is part of that.<br/><br/>The web platform is broken , and Anvil is our attempt to fix it. And, because there is so much complexity in deploying a web app, a cloud-hosted service was the best way to provide the simplicity we want. That way, you can build your app in the Anvil Editor, and make it live on the Internet with one click.<br/><br/>But we kept hearing from people who said, "that's great, but…"<br/><br/>"…but I need to run this on an offshore platform without reliable internet access"<br/><br/>"…but I want to package my app into an IoT device I sell"<br/><br/>or simply, "…but if I'm putting my eggs in this basket, how can I be sure I can still run my app in ten years' time?"<br/><br/>These are all good points! A cloud service isn't the right solution for everyone. If we want to serve these users, there's got to be some way for them to get their apps out of Anvil and run them locally, under their own complete control.<br/><br/>Open Source: Escape hatch, not an ejector seat<br/><br/>We believe in escape hatches, not ejector seats. At conferences, we sometimes get asked, "can I export this as a Flask+JS app?". Sure, it would be possible – we could generate a server package, compile the client-side Python to Javascript, and spit out a classic web app. But it would have serious drawbacks, because:<br/><br/>Not a comfy ride.<br/><br/>Code generation is an ejector seat. Generated code is better than nothing – at least you can edit it! But the moment you edit that code, you lose all the benefits of the system that generated it. If you're using Anvil because of its drag-and-drop editor and Python in the browser, why should our locally-hosted users have to use vim and Javascript?<br/><br/>So we did it the right way: we open-sourced Anvil's runtime engine. It's the same code that serves your app in our hosted service, and it represents your app the same way. You can edit your code with a text editor, run it, then git push it back into our online IDE. It's not an ejector seat: there's no explosive transition. It's an escape hatch: you can climb out, and climb right back in.<br/><br/>What about our business model?<br/><br/>Anvil was never meant to be one of those enterprise low-code systems that charge you $20/mo for each person who uses your app. Anvil is a developer tool. The apps you develop are yours. Enabling you to run them on a Raspberry Pi is cool, but it doesn't change our business model.<br/><br/>We're doing what we always were: We make and sell a development tool that makes it drastically simpler to build web applications. We provide hosting for Anvil apps. We offer the entire development-and-hosting platform on-site for enterprise customers. And, of course, we offer a free plan so that everyone can use Anvil for hobby or educational purposes – or to start building something and see how it goes.<br/><br/>We've open-sourced the Anvil App Server for the (relatively small) number of people who need it, and to provide the ultimate insurance policy. Sure, you can build an app with vim and host it yourself, without even registering an account with us (we've got docs to show you how!). But the Anvil Editor is the world's easiest way to build a web app, and our hosted service is the easiest way to deploy it – so that's what we expect most of our users to continue doing. And you can build with confidence, knowing that the open-source code is right there if you need it.<br/><br/>Try it yourself<br/><br/>If our development philosophy resonates with you, why not try Anvil yourself? | Pourquoi nous avons ouvert le serveur Anvil App<br/><br/>Pourquoi l’open source ?<br/><br/>Il y a peu de temps, nous avons ouvert le serveur Anvil App. La réaction de la communauté a été formidable, même un peu écrasante (oui, chaque réponse à cette annonce a vraiment atterri dans ma boîte de réception!). Nous avons déjà intégré un tas de ces commentaires dans notre version 1.2, mais on ne cesse de nous demander : « Pourquoi avez-vous ouvert le code source d'une partie aussi importante de votre produit ? »<br/><br/>Pourquoi faire ça ?<br/><br/>Anvil est un outil qui rend aussi simple que possible de construire une application web. Nous le faisons en vous permettant de construire l'application entière dans un langage, Python.<br/><br/>L’hébergement simple en fait partie.<br/><br/>La plate-forme Web est cassée, et Anvil est notre tentative de le réparer. Et, parce qu'il y a tellement de complexité dans le déploiement d'une application Web, un service hébergé dans le cloud était le meilleur moyen de fournir la simplicité que nous voulons. De cette façon, vous pouvez créer votre application dans l'éditeur d'enclume et la faire vivre sur Internet en un seul clic.<br/><br/>Mais nous avons continué à entendre des gens qui disaient: «C’est formidable, mais...»<br/><br/>"...mais j'ai besoin d'exécuter cela sur une plate-forme offshore sans accès Internet fiable"<br/><br/>"...mais je veux empaqueter mon application dans un appareil IoT que je vends"<br/><br/>ou tout simplement, "...mais si je mets mes œufs dans ce panier, comment puis-je être sûr que je peux toujours exécuter mon application dans dix ans?"<br/><br/>Ce sont tous de bons points! Un service cloud n'est pas la bonne solution pour tout le monde. Si nous voulons servir ces utilisateurs, il doit y avoir un moyen pour eux de sortir leurs applications d'Anvil et de les exécuter localement, sous leur propre contrôle.<br/><br/>Open Source : trappe d'évacuation, pas un siège d'éjecteur<br/><br/>Nous croyons aux trappes d'évacuation, pas aux sièges d'éjection. Lors des conférences, on nous demande parfois: "Puis-je exporter cela sous forme d'application Flask + JS?". Bien sûr, ce serait possible - nous pourrions générer un paquet de serveur, compiler le côté client Python à Javascript, et cracher une application Web classique. Mais il aurait de sérieux inconvénients, parce que:<br/><br/>C'est pas confortable.<br/><br/>La génération de code est un siège éjectable. Le code généré vaut mieux que rien – au moins, vous pouvez le modifier! Mais au moment où vous modifiez ce code, vous perdez tous les avantages du système qui l’a généré. Si vous utilisez Anvil en raison de son éditeur glisser-déposer et Python dans le navigateur, pourquoi nos utilisateurs hébergés localement devraient-ils utiliser vim et Javascript?<br/><br/>Nous l'avons donc fait de la bonne façon: nous avons ouvert le moteur d'exécution d'Anvil. C'est le même code qui sert votre application dans notre service hébergé, et il représente votre application de la même manière. Vous pouvez éditer votre code avec un éditeur de texte, l'exécuter, puis le renvoyer dans notre IDE en ligne. Ce n'est pas un siège d'éjecteur: il n'y a pas de transition explosive. C'est une trappe d'évacuation: vous pouvez grimper et remonter.<br/><br/>Qu'en est-il de notre modèle d'affaires?<br/><br/>Anvil n'a jamais été conçu pour être l'un de ces systèmes d'entreprise low-code qui vous facturent 20 $ / mois pour chaque personne qui utilise votre application. Anvil est un outil de développement. Les applications que vous développez sont les vôtres. Vous permettre de les exécuter sur un Raspberry Pi est cool, mais cela ne change pas notre modèle économique.<br/><br/>Nous faisons ce que nous avons toujours été: Nous fabriquons et vendons un outil de développement qui simplifie considérablement la création d'applications Web. Nous fournissons l'hébergement pour les applications Anvil. Nous offrons l'ensemble de la plate-forme de développement et d'hébergement sur site pour les clients d'entreprise. Et, bien sûr, nous offrons un plan gratuit afin que tout le monde puisse utiliser Anvil à des fins récréatives ou éducatives - ou pour commencer à construire quelque chose et voir comment ça se passe.<br/><br/>Nous avons ouvert le serveur d'applications Anvil pour le nombre (relativement faible) de personnes qui en ont besoin et pour fournir la police d'assurance ultime. Bien sûr, vous pouvez créer une application avec vim et l'héberger vous-même, sans même ouvrir de compte avec nous (nous avons des documents pour vous montrer comment!). Mais Anvil Editor est le moyen le plus simple au monde de créer une application Web, et notre service hébergé est le moyen le plus facile de la déployer – c’est donc ce que nous attendons de la plupart de nos utilisateurs. Et vous pouvez construire en toute confiance, sachant que le code open source est là si vous en avez besoin.<br/><br/>Essayez-le vous-même<br/><br/>Si notre philosophie de développement résonne avec vous, pourquoi ne pas essayer Anvil vous-même? |
