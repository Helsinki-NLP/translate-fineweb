| UNDERSTANDING SELF-EXECUTING TREATIES VIA STATE PRACTICE<br/><br/>Updated: Feb 2<br/><br/>Introduction:<br/><br/>Consider this paradox, when a country ratifies a treaty, it is said to have consented to accept the treaty in its entirety (reservations and declarations being exceptions); but in some cases, the countries go ahead and refuse to adhere to its provisions. For example, Article VI, Clause 2 of the American Constitution has the provisions that "all treaties … shall be the supreme Law of the Land." Although it is evident that treaties on their own do not have the same effect as federal laws. In truth, they only become operational once these provisions come into force as Federal law with Senate and Presidential approval. Although this is the practice, it is a generally accepted principle in international law that certain treaties have a binding effect on countries. The treaty must fulfil the requirement of being a self-executing treaty to affect the country without any corresponding domestic legislature directly.<br/><br/>This raises the question as to which treaty will qualify as "self-executing" and which will not?<br/><br/>Whether a treaty is a self-executing treaty or not is decided by national judges on a case-to-case basis (Buergenthal, 1992). In order to understand this, the paper will first look at the two types of theories followed by countries on the nature of treaties applying to domestic law. These two theories are monism and dualism. They basically view the framework of domestic and international law as a single hierarchy and two separate hierarchies, respectively (Wildhaber, 1971). Countries following monism believe that certain treaties immediately are binding and immediately have an effect on the country. Once the treaty has been ratified, it can be invoked in national courts and is considered to be a part of the law of the country. Countries following dualism believe that a treaty does not affect domestic law until it has been reinforced by a legislature passed in the parliament. An example of dualism is how the European Convention on Human Rights became operational in the United Kingdom after passing the Human Rights Act 1998 in their parliament (Laws, 2000).<br/><br/>International law is diverse, and so are the types of procedures different countries follow for the acceptance of treaties. Some constitutions' themselves mention the procedures for the ratification of a treaty. Some countries even have different treatment given to international treaty law and customary international law. Certain international organizations like the European Union often affect the domestic law of its member states. The member states of the European Union have to give effect to certain forms of community legislature. Although, it has an essential difference from self-executing treaties. The difference is that it is not for national judges to decide whether the provisions are self-executing or not, but rather for the European Court of Justice to interpret under its constitutive treaties. Other forms of international law formed via resolutions or such might not have the same effect for these states. Nevertheless, they might consider them as forms of "soft law" and look into them to interpret the intent of the law. Sometimes, proclamations made by the judicial organs of international organizations such as the Inter-American Court of Human Rights affect their member states. Although these proclamations are not binding on the member states, the national judges seem to refer to these for authoritative interpretation.<br/><br/>Therefore, a case-to-case approach must be taken while analyzing the procedures and precedents set in different countries. To examine the concept of self-executing treaties, this paper will compare the precedents set by different jurisdictions. If the reader wishes to conduct a similar analysis, they can do so by looking into the different national yearbooks on international law. Mostly, these yearbooks will have a section devoted to the relationship between international and national law.<br/><br/>International Jurisprudence:<br/><br/>The most significant issue that comes up for national courts is whether the treaty is self-executing? If the treaty can be applied without any additional domestic legislature having passed to reinforce it. This question came up in the case of Czesław S v State Treasury and Minister of the State Treasury, wherein the Polish Constitutional Court held that since the treaty provisions referred to domestic measures to be taken, the treaty was not self-executing in nature (Bug river claims, Czesław S v State Treasury and Minister of the State Treasury, 2003). Essentially, when the treaty refers to domestic measures to be taken, it does not in itself create new obligations. It instead reinforces the treaty's intent for the domestic legal process to take measures for the same. A similar issue was raised in the Sosa case in the United States of America. In this case, the court considered whether the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights was a self-executing treaty. The American Supreme Court has also declared that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is not a self-executing treaty (Court, 2004). The Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland also examined the self-executing nature of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The issue before the court was whether Article 13(2)(b) and (c) were self-executing in nature. The court examined whether the treaty was partially self-executing and did so by checking whether there existed a minimum core content for the treaty to be applicable. The court held that it found no such provision within the treaty (A and B v Government of the Canton of Zurich, 2000).<br/><br/>It is essential to understand that these issues differ from the fundamental question of whether international law can be applied as part of the law of the land? In order to answer this question, the paper will examine the judgement by the Supreme Court of the Dominican Republic. The Supreme Court stated that Article 3 of the Dominican Republic's Constitution made international law binding on the domestic legal order. The court rejected the Superior Land Court's interpretation that these treaties were "foreign legislature" and not part of the domestic legal order. The Supreme Court laid down that all treaties ratified by the Dominican Republic formed a part of Dominican Law and, therefore, can be termed as self-executing (Gallardo Montilla v Gallardo Concepción and ors, 1997). The Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland has examined whether the Libson Treaty was self-executing and directly applicable to Swiss Universities. The court held, "According to relevant case law, a treaty norm is directly applicable if its content is sufficiently precise and clear to form the basis of a decision in a particular case. The norm thus has to be justiciable, i.e. define the rights and obligations of an individual and be directed at the competent authorities" (X v University of Lucerne, 2014). This implies that whether the treaty is directly applicable or not, depends upon on whether the norm is justiciable. The Lisbon Treaty is based on the principle of qualifications acquired aboard. This is conveyed through Article IV (1) of the treaty. The purpose of this was to create an obligation for states to show that their decision-making process is fair, transparent and non-discriminatory. The responsibility for proving that the applicant has not met the required criteria is on the "body undertaking the assessment." The treaty guarantees procedural safeguards, which are generally accepted by countries and hence, the court held this treaty to be self-executing. This goes on to showcase the different interpretations undertaken by the courts of various countries.<br/><br/>It is essential to observe whether the norms set out by treaties are actually being complied with. The case laws from various jurisdictions have emphasized that national courts are the final authority on the issue of whether a treaty is self-executing. There is also an inherent duty cast on countries for the observance and due performance of treaties. Such is cast by the Pacta Sunt Servanda rule as enshrined within Article 26 of the Vienna Convention on Law of Treaties (VCLT). Article 27 goes on to reinforce it by stating that international law obligations cannot be ignored by using domestic law as a justification. Many countries' courts have used this as a source of interpretation, such as the Latvian Constitutional Court. In the case of a national norm conflicting with an international norm, the court held that the national norm was null and void. To reach its conclusion, the court strongly relied on the necessary performance of treaties in good faith as envisaged in Article 26 of the VCLT (Linija v Latvia, 2004).<br/><br/>Conclusion:<br/><br/>From the above, it is clear that treaties have particular requirements before they can be considered self-executing. However, keeping all of these aside, the most important still remains the national courts' interpretation. The national courts decide whether the treaty can be called self-executing or not. Although their Constitution's might contain a provision regarding treaty law being the supreme law of the land, courts from different countries interpret these provisions in different manners. This can be seen as to how the American and Dominican Constitutions' both contain these provisions but follow completely different interpretations of the same. The term "self-executing" may not be congruous for these treaties since, in practice, they still need approval from the national courts. Ideally, the way forward should be that countries acknowledge the self-executing nature of treaties and treat them in a fashion wherein Article 26 and 27 of the VCLT are respected. Again, this is the "ideal" situation and is not likely to find its way into state practice of certain jurisdictions anytime soon. Still, hope can be gained via looking into the interpretations of national courts that respect these norms and hopefully pave the way for other courts to acknowledge this.<br/><br/>References:<br/><br/>Buergenthal, T.

Par exemple, l'article VI, alinéa 2 de la Constitution américaine dispose que "tous les traités ... doivent être la loi suprême du pays." Bien qu'il soit évident que les traités seuls n'ont pas le même effet que les lois fédérales. En vérité, ils ne deviennent opérationnels qu’une fois que ces dispositions entrent en vigueur en tant que loi fédérale avec l’approbation du Sénat et du Président. Bien que ce soit la pratique, il est généralement admis en droit international que certains traités ont un effet contraignant sur les pays. Le traité doit remplir l'exigence d'être un traité auto-exécutable pour affecter le pays sans aucune législature nationale correspondante directement.<br/><br/>Cela soulève la question de savoir quel traité sera qualifié d'"auto-exécutable" et lequel ne le sera pas?<br/><br/>La question de savoir si un traité est un traité auto-exécutant ou non est tranchée au cas par cas par les juges nationaux (Buergenthal, 1992). Pour comprendre cela, le document se penchera d'abord sur les deux types de théories suivies par les pays sur la nature des traités qui s'appliquent au droit interne. Ces deux théories sont le monisme et le dualisme. Ils considèrent fondamentalement le cadre du droit national et international comme une hiérarchie unique et deux hiérarchies distinctes, respectivement (Wildhaber, 1971). Les pays qui suivent le monisme estiment que certains traités sont immédiatement contraignants et ont immédiatement un effet sur le pays. Une fois que le traité a été ratifié, il peut être invoqué devant les tribunaux nationaux et est considéré comme faisant partie du droit du pays. Les pays qui suivent le dualisme estiment qu'un traité n'affecte pas le droit interne tant qu'il n'a pas été renforcé par une législature adoptée au Parlement. Un exemple de dualisme est la façon dont la Convention européenne des droits de l'homme est devenue opérationnelle au Royaume-Uni après l'adoption de la loi de 1998 sur les droits de l'homme par leur parlement (Lois, 2000).<br/><br/>Le droit international est divers, de même que les types de procédures suivies par les différents pays pour l'acceptation des traités. Certains pays ont même un traitement différent du droit international des traités et du droit international coutumier. Certaines organisations internationales comme l'Union européenne affectent souvent le droit interne de ses États membres. Les États membres de l'Union européenne doivent donner effet à certaines formes de législation communautaire, bien qu'il y ait une différence essentielle par rapport aux traités auto-exécutants. La différence est que ce n'est pas aux juges nationaux de décider si les dispositions sont directement applicables ou non, mais plutôt à la Cour européenne de justice d'interpréter en vertu de ses traités constitutifs. D'autres formes de droit international formées par le biais de résolutions ou autres pourraient ne pas avoir le même effet pour ces États, mais ils pourraient les considérer comme des formes de « droit non contraignant » et les examiner pour interpréter l'intention de la loi. Parfois, les proclamations faites par les organes judiciaires d'organisations internationales telles que la Cour interaméricaine des droits de l'homme affectent leurs États membres. Bien que ces proclamations ne soient pas contraignantes pour les États membres, les juges nationaux semblent s'y référer pour une interprétation faisant autorité.<br/><br/>Par conséquent, une approche au cas par cas doit être adoptée lors de l’analyse des procédures et des précédents établis dans différents pays. Pour examiner le concept de traités auto-exécutables, le présent document comparera les précédents établis par différentes juridictions. Si le lecteur souhaite procéder à une analyse similaire, il peut le faire en consultant les différents annuaires nationaux sur le droit international, qui comprendront principalement une section consacrée aux relations entre le droit international et le droit national.<br/><br/>Jurisprudence internationale :<br/><br/>La question la plus importante qui se pose pour les tribunaux nationaux est de savoir si le traité est auto-exécutable? Si le traité peut être appliqué sans qu'aucune législation nationale supplémentaire n'ait été adoptée pour le renforcer. Cette question a été soulevée dans l ' affaire Czeslaw S c. Trésor public et Ministre du Trésor public, dans laquelle la Cour constitutionnelle polonaise a estimé que, puisque les dispositions du traité faisaient référence aux mesures nationales à prendre, le traité n ' était pas de nature auto-exécutoire (Bug river claims, Czeslaw S c. Trésor public et Ministre du Trésor public, 2003). Fondamentalement, lorsque le traité fait référence à des mesures nationales à prendre, il ne crée pas en soi de nouvelles obligations, mais renforce l'intention du traité pour que le processus juridique interne prenne des mesures pour le même. Une question similaire a été soulevée dans l'affaire Sosa aux États-Unis d'Amérique, où le tribunal s'est demandé si le Pacte international relatif aux droits civils et politiques était un traité directement applicable. La Cour suprême américaine a également déclaré que le Pacte international relatif aux droits civils et politiques n'est pas un traité auto-exécutant (Cour, 2004). La Cour suprême fédérale de Suisse a également examiné le caractère auto-exécutif du Pacte international relatif aux droits civils et politiques, en se demandant si les alinéas b) et c) du paragraphe 2 de l'article 13 étaient de nature auto-exécutive. La Cour a examiné si le traité était partiellement auto-exécutable et l’a fait en vérifiant s’il existait un contenu de base minimum pour que le traité soit applicable. La Cour a jugé qu’elle n’avait pas conclu à l’existence d’une telle disposition dans le traité (A et B contre Gouvernement du canton de Zurich, 2000).<br/><br/>Il est essentiel de comprendre que ces questions diffèrent de la question fondamentale de savoir si le droit international peut être appliqué dans le cadre du droit du pays. Afin de répondre à cette question, le document examinera le jugement de la Cour suprême de la République dominicaine. La Cour suprême a déclaré que l'article 3 de la Constitution de la République dominicaine rendait le droit international obligatoire pour l'ordre juridique interne. La Cour a rejeté l'interprétation de la Cour supérieure de terre selon laquelle ces traités étaient « législatifs étrangers » et ne faisaient pas partie de l'ordre juridique interne. La Cour suprême a statué que tous les traités ratifiés par la République dominicaine faisaient partie du droit dominicain et pouvaient donc être qualifiés d'auto-exécutifs (Gallardo Montilla c. Gallardo Concepcion and ors, 1997). Le Tribunal fédéral suisse a examiné si le traité Libson était directement applicable aux universités suisses. Selon la jurisprudence pertinente, une norme conventionnelle est directement applicable si son contenu est suffisamment précis et clair pour constituer la base d’une décision dans un cas particulier. La norme doit donc être justiciable, c’est-à-dire définir les droits et obligations d’un individu et être adressée aux autorités compétentes » (X v University of Lucerne, 2014). Cela implique que la question de savoir si le traité est directement applicable ou non dépend de la question de savoir si la norme est justiciable. Le traité de Lisbonne repose sur le principe des qualifications acquises à bord, ce qui se traduit par le paragraphe 1 de l'article IV du traité. L’objectif était de créer une obligation pour les États de démontrer que leur processus décisionnel est équitable, transparent et non discriminatoire. La responsabilité de prouver que le demandeur n'a pas satisfait aux critères requis incombe à « l'organisme procédant à l'évaluation ». Le traité garantit des garanties procédurales, qui sont généralement acceptées par les pays et, par conséquent, la Cour a jugé que ce traité était auto-exécutable, ce qui met en évidence les différentes interprétations adoptées par les tribunaux de différents pays.<br/><br/>Il est essentiel de vérifier si les normes énoncées par les traités sont effectivement respectées, et la jurisprudence de diverses juridictions a souligné que les tribunaux nationaux sont l'autorité suprême sur la question de savoir si un traité est auto-exécutable. Il existe également un devoir inhérent pour les pays de respecter et d'exécuter les traités, conformément à la règle Pacta Sunt Servanda consacrée par l'article 26 de la Convention de Vienne sur le droit des traités (VCLT). L'article 27 le renforce en précisant que les obligations de droit international ne peuvent pas être ignorées en invoquant le droit interne comme justification, ce que de nombreux tribunaux de pays ont utilisé comme source d'interprétation, comme la Cour constitutionnelle lettone. Dans le cas d'une norme nationale en conflit avec une norme internationale, la Cour a jugé que la norme nationale était nulle et non avenue. Pour parvenir à sa conclusion, la Cour s’est fortement appuyée sur l’exécution nécessaire des traités de bonne foi, telle qu’elle est envisagée à l’article 26 de la VCLT (Linija c. Lettonie, 2004).<br/><br/>Conclusion :<br/><br/>Il ressort clairement de ce qui précède que les traités ont des exigences particulières avant de pouvoir être considérés comme auto-exécutables, mais le plus important reste l'interprétation des juridictions nationales. Les tribunaux nationaux décident si le traité peut être qualifié d'auto-exécutoire ou non. Bien que leur Constitution puisse contenir une disposition selon laquelle le droit des traités est la loi suprême du pays, les tribunaux de différents pays interprètent ces dispositions de différentes manières. Cela peut être vu comme la façon dont les Constitutions américaines et dominicaines contiennent ces dispositions, mais suivent des interprétations complètement différentes de la même. Le terme "auto-exécution" n'est peut-être pas approprié pour ces traités car, dans la pratique, ils doivent encore être approuvés par les tribunaux nationaux. Idéalement, la voie à suivre devrait être que les pays reconnaissent le caractère auto-exécutable des traités et les traitent de manière à ce que les articles 26 et 27 de la CVLT soient respectés. Encore une fois, c'est la situation «idéale» et il est peu probable qu'elle se retrouve dans la pratique étatique de certaines juridictions de sitôt. Pourtant, l'espoir peut être gagné en examinant les interprétations des tribunaux nationaux qui respectent ces normes et, espérons-le, ouvrir la voie à d'autres tribunaux pour reconnaître cela.<br/><br/>Références:<br/><br/>Buergenthal, T.

Whether it is a last-minute job request or a paper that you forgot to write and it is due the next day, stress can always find a way into your day if you allow it. Today I will show you a few things you can do to eliminate or prevent stress.<br/><br/>The first thing you can do is to exercise. Exercising is a great way to relieve stress because it lowers the stress hormone in your body known as cortisol. The lower levels of cortisol in your body, the lower your stress level will be. Exercise can also increase your confidence, and when your confidence is up then your stress is usually down. For me, when I get stressed, I always exercise by going to the gym and practice boxing, it helps me burn calories and reduce stress while having fun.<br/><br/>Writing things down has been a way to calm people down for a very long time, and it is the next topic on our list. Writing down what is making you stressed is a way to clear the mind, and it helps get rid of stress as well. I have a similar experience when writing stories, usually if I cannot think of a new idea because of an old one, I will write the old idea down and think on it. That is when new ideas start to spring up and I can continue writing normally. It is the same with stress. Think about a stream it continues to flow down it's path until it hits a beaver dam, and that dam blocks the flow of water and everything starts to build up. The only way to get the water flow back to normal is to remove the dam. This is where writing comes in. When you write it down, you are removing stress piece by piece until you can think normally again.<br/><br/>Stress can come into our lives through doors in our life that we keep open. Procrastination is a way that we can leave the doors open for stress. Waiting until tomorrow may be fun for today, but it will hurt you tomorrow, and is a very short-sighted solution. The longer you wait to do something, the larger that something becomes, and the larger it becomes the more stress you will be inviting into your life. Taking care of something as soon as we receive it is a great way to prevent stress, but it is something that takes great discipline to do. The more you cut Procrastination out of your life, the more stress free you will be. So shut that door, you're letting all the cold air out.<br/><br/>So let's review: Exercise, Write down what is stressing you, and Do not Procrastinate. These are only a few ways to relieve stress but to me, they are the most effective. While I know these may not work for everyone I would like to invite anyone feeling stressed to research how to get rid of it. | BLOGUES<br/><br/>Consultez notre collection de blogs écrits par d'autres membres du personnel.<br/><br/>BLOGS D'INFORMATION<br/><br/>Ne le stressez pas<br/><br/>par<br/>Kristen Hogan<br/>12 nov. 2020<br/><br/>Le stress, peu importe comment les choses vont, il peut toujours trouver un moyen d'élever sa tête laid. Que ce soit une demande d'emploi de dernière minute ou un papier que vous avez oublié d'écrire et il est dû le lendemain, le stress peut toujours trouver un chemin dans votre journée si vous le permettez. Aujourd'hui, je vais vous montrer quelques choses que vous pouvez faire pour éliminer ou prévenir le stress.<br/><br/>La première chose que vous pouvez faire est de faire de l'exercice. L'exercice est un excellent moyen de soulager le stress, car il abaisse l'hormone du stress dans votre corps connue sous le nom de cortisol. Les niveaux inférieurs de cortisol dans votre corps, plus votre niveau de stress sera. L’exercice peut également augmenter votre confiance, et lorsque votre confiance est en hausse, votre stress est généralement en baisse. Pour moi, quand je suis stressé, je fais toujours de l’exercice en allant au gymnase et en pratiquant la boxe, cela m’aide à brûler des calories et à réduire le stress tout en m’amusant.<br/><br/>Écrire des choses a été un moyen de calmer les gens pendant très longtemps, et c'est le prochain sujet sur notre liste. Écrire ce qui vous stresse est un moyen de clarifier l'esprit, et cela aide aussi à se débarrasser du stress. J'ai une expérience similaire quand j'écris des histoires, généralement si je ne peux pas penser à une nouvelle idée à cause d'une ancienne, je vais écrire l'ancienne idée et y réfléchir. C'est à ce moment-là que de nouvelles idées commencent à surgir et je peux continuer à écrire normalement. C'est la même chose avec le stress. Pensez à un ruisseau qu'il continue à couler sur son chemin jusqu'à ce qu'il heurte un barrage de castor, et que le barrage bloque le flux d'eau et que tout commence à s'accumuler. La seule façon de ramener le flux d'eau à la normale est d'enlever le barrage. C'est là que l'écriture entre en jeu. Lorsque vous l'écrivez, vous supprimez le stress pièce par pièce jusqu'à ce que vous puissiez penser à nouveau normalement.<br/><br/>Le stress peut entrer dans nos vies par des portes que nous gardons ouvertes. La procrastination est un moyen de laisser les portes ouvertes au stress. Attendre demain peut être amusant pour aujourd'hui, mais cela vous fera mal demain, et c'est une solution à courte vue. Plus vous attendez pour faire quelque chose, plus quelque chose devient grand, et plus il devient grand, plus le stress que vous allez inviter dans votre vie. Prendre soin de quelque chose dès que nous le recevons est un excellent moyen de prévenir le stress, mais c'est quelque chose qui nécessite une grande discipline. Plus vous éliminez la procrastination de votre vie, plus vous serez sans stress. Alors ferme cette porte, tu laisses sortir tout l'air froid.<br/><br/>Exerçons-nous, notez ce qui vous stresse et ne tergiversez pas. Ce ne sont que quelques façons de soulager le stress, mais pour moi, ce sont les plus efficaces. Bien que je sache que ceux-ci peuvent ne pas fonctionner pour tout le monde, j'aimerais inviter toute personne se sentant stressée à faire des recherches sur la façon de s'en débarrasser. |
