| While acknowledging that it's impossible to argue someone into loving something they hate, and vice versa, it's still often enjoyable to attempt the argument. When we talk to people whose opinions directly contradict ours, we're forced to defend our tastes, define our opinions, and analyze why we react the way we do. Which is why we have Why Don't You Like This?, in which two of our staffers will attempt to discover whether people with opposing opinions can get beyond "No, you're wrong!" and have a civil, constructive, and possibly even convincing discussion about their points of contention. Because no matter what talk radio says, there's still a middle ground between "We agree utterly" and "I'm right, and you're stupid and evil."<br/><br/>Scott: Since discussing my Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World apostasy, we've been looking for a case where I can call you out for not liking something wonderful, and we didn't have to look for long. We were sitting right next to each other during Martin Scorsese's Hugo—me, utterly enchanted by its fantastical tribute to the wonders of early silent cinema, and you, apparently resisting it at every turn. Critical consensus has been on my side: It hit the No. 9 spot on our collective Top 15 (though you listed it as your Overrated choice), has won (or placed) in various film-critic awards, and currently enjoys an 83 score on Metacritic. That doesn't mean you're wrong, of course, but the onus is on you to explain why Hugo was, in your words, "hollow and artificial," where many of us saw it as a lovely evocation of Scorsese's childhood and the medium when it was still in its infancy. And please be gentle as you rip this butterfly apart by the wings.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Tasha: I can't be gentle, Scott. Sometimes it hurts less if you rip the Band-Aid off all at once. (And even if it doesn't, who wants to walk around wearing a half-ripped-off Band-Aid? Gross.) The fact is, I found Hugo to be a wearyingly manipulative exercise in fakery, starting from its opening glide through a Paris train station, which reminded me more than anything of Robert Zemeckis' The Polar Express. Unlike Mike D'Angelo, I'm a fan of long, unbroken takes as a way of establishing a space and encouraging viewers to unconsciously hold their breaths as a camera explores an area; but when the space being explored is a slick, shiny CGI creation, and the camera floats weightlessly through it with no physical sense that either the camera or the surroundings are really there, that exploration starts to feel like watching someone else play a videogame. And the rest of the film felt similarly poreless and unreal to me, both in terms of its setting and in terms of its highly contrived, maudlin story.<br/><br/>I don't necessarily have a problem with manufactured, stylized environments in film. I loved Baz Luhrmann's equally sprawling, utterly artificial take on Paris in Moulin Rouge, for instance, but that film has a sense of its own ridiculousness, a sense of humor about how deliberately over-the-top it is. Ditto the stylization of Jean-Pierre Jeunet, particularly in Amélie. (Both Jeunet and Luhrmann felt like strong visual influences here.) I got the sense, however, that Martin Scorsese wanted me to take Hugo entirely seriously. Even though it's yet another achingly sentimental story about a plucky orphan bringing color back into the life of a grumpy old curmudgeon. And I just couldn't.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>There is nothing I enjoy more in film than being surprised. And there's nothing I resent and resist more than being overtly manipulated, being loudly told what to feel and when to feel it. A good film does this kind of thing subtly; a bad one uses crashing music cues and sweet strings—and in this case, a grubby, huge-eyed, disheveled orphan staring woefully at the camera—to demand pathos, and to tell viewers they're horrible people if they don't serve it up on demand. That said, I can deal with sad kids and grumpy adults making life better for each other—I really dug this year's Le Havre, which was essentially the same plot without all the cutesiness—but I find the artificial environments reflect badly on the artificial emotions, and each makes the other seem more fake by turns.<br/><br/>Let's start with that. In our overlooked films video, you and Noel both took Keith to task for championing Tyrannosaur, because you felt it wasn't realistic enough—too contrived, too miserablist, too much, too far. How is it possible that you can't buy a stymied old crank who breaks things when he's angry, but you can buy an orphan living inside a giant train-station clock and embarking upon a whimsical journey to repair a mysterious automaton that he believes might bear secrets from his dead father, but which instead leads him on a quirky voyage of self-discovery, into the magical land of cinema? Did you never find Hugo's gaudy rococo design, aggressive heartstring-plucking, or wheelbarrow-loads of quirk even a little excessive or hard to swallow?<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Scott: Jeunet and Luhrmann as influences on Scorsese?! Forget being indelicate, now you're deliberately poking me with a sharp stick. If you're looking for inspirations for Hugo—indeed, if you're looking for the emotional core of Hugo—you have to go back to Scorsese's childhood on Elizabeth Street in Little Italy, where an asthmatic little boy, unable to play outside with the other kids, retreated to Alexander Korda fantasies like The Thief Of Bagdad. Or, more simply, just go straight to the source himself: George Méliès, whose A Trip To The Moon remains the Big Bang of all cinematic fantasies, that moment when the camera was not used to document the world as it is, but whatever whimsical, magical, transporting place a filmmaker wants to invent for it. And that tradition has been developed and expanded upon for decades before the likes of Jeunet and Luhrmann got their grubby little paws on it.<br/><br/>And speaking of Jeunet, nice attempt to take away my rhetorical weapon, but I'll say it anyway: How can you love Amélie, yet find Hugo synthetic and "excessive" and "wearyingly manipulative"? You say that Amélie and Moulin Rouge have redeeming "sense of [their] own ridiculousness" where Scorsese means us to take Hugo seriously, and I don't think that's the case, at least on the latter point. That Scorsese feels evident passion about the movies is, I suppose, why you'd interpret Hugo as self-serious. But to me, it's those feelings that give the film an emotional ballast that the Luhrmann and Jeunet films don't have. All three films make aggressive use of the marvels of CGI—and Scorsese adds 3D to the mix, to wonderful effect—but where you and I differ is on the issue of weightlessness. I agree that CGI has a distancing effect; worlds composed entirely of digital plasticine are flexible to the point where they sometimes have no presence. You referred to Hugo in your "Overrated" entry for our Best Of Film piece as "a CGI gimcrack"—a perfect dis… for another movie.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>It's fair to say that Scorsese has built Hugo around a standard-issue, "heartstring-plucking" children's book/movie plot: Orphan misses his daddy, creates his own little fantasy world, gloms onto a new friend, convinces a crusty old fuddy-duddy to soften up and maybe adopt him. But that's just the narrative skeleton, and Scorsese provides plenty of flesh and blood. For one, you can't watch Hugo, the lonely boy, peering out from clock towers to the hustle-and-bustle of a Paris train station without thinking of Scorsese, another lonely boy, staring out of his bedroom window on Elizabeth Street. And even if you're not a big enough film nerd to make that connection, I really feel like Hugo's journey is not in finding a new father figure, but in persisting with the mechanical magic that stands as his own father's legacy. That's what film is: The persistence of vision that allows us to accept an illusory version of the world at 24 frames per second is science and magic at once. Hugo's relationship with Méliès isn't about him cozying up to a new daddy, but sharing a common enthusiasm the old man has submerged in bitterness. To me, that's a far more unique angle on a potentially shopworn premise.<br/><br/>Did you really find none of Hugo enchanting? Even the film's few detractors seem willing to admit that the sequences evoking cinema history and Méliès' studio—with Michael Stuhlbarg as the heroic film scholar!—were terrific. It felt, in the best possible way, like a heady compression of my History Of Film 101 class in college, condensing a semester's worth of clips and context into something between a montage and an animated pop-up book. And it speaks to the ingenious design of the film, which layers fact and fantasy so beautifully that it's at once a history of Méliès and the birth of cinema, and just the sort of simple, sumptuously produced cinematic wonder that Scorsese himself would have loved as a child. Thank goodness Hugo doesn't follow the Jeunet/Luhrmann model and have "a sense of its own ridiculousness." As a fantasy connoisseur yourself, wouldn't you say there's value in playing it straight and earnest and unabashed rather than winking at the audience? You may find Hugo sickly sweet, but I don't think the authenticity of its sentiment is to be denied.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Tasha: Yes, I did in fact find parts of Hugo enchanting. (Notice how I'm answering your question up front, whereas you were too busy frothing with apoplexy to address mine, though I assume that's an answer in its own right. Okay, "influence" may be overstating the case—I just meant the visual style looked very familiar. Though as Keith pointed out when you brought this up in person, Scorsese is neither opposed to drawing inspiration from other people's visuals, nor immune to it.) Primarily, I was enchanted by the parts dealing with Georges Méliès' backstory, with his love of cinema, with the work he put into his art and the joy he got out of it. There's an awful lot of beauty and fun in the staging of the underwater-court scene from Méliès' "Fairyland," and in the sequence at the end, focusing on Méliès footage. I'll grant you that Hugo's connection with Méliès over a shared love of film is a nice touch. And I do enjoy a good film about filmmaking.<br/><br/>But Hugo isn't primarily about film, in spite of the Méliès tie-ins. In addition to the themes you cite, it's also about finding your purpose, as the characters expressly, laboriously explain to each other and to us. And it's about spectacle, and big action setpieces, and chases, and happily-ever-after endings where even the angry bully and the shy older couple and fergawdsakes even the cranky dachshund all get paired off with charming love interests by the end. It's about the super-precocious Hermione Granger-type being bossy and perky and clever and praising the magical worlds encased in books. And all of this business is mighty familiar, and mighty artificial.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Yes, Scorsese is playing with archetypes. Problem is, I never felt he imbued them with anything new, fresh, or believable, in spite of his own backstory. I would have much preferred a story about a young Scorsese growing up with asthma—something small-scale and real, without vast rooms full of CGI clockwork and golden glowing dust-motes and prophetic dreams and a raging adult tyrant-guard with a heart of gold—all of that outsized, over-the-top nonsense. You keep citing Scorsese's personal background and love of film as evidence that he's really feeling what he's putting on the screen, but I don't feel his personal touch in any of this, except the moments that are expressly about film. The core emotions may be real, but that doesn't make the execution less false.<br/><br/>You say the authenticity of the emotion isn't to be denied. I don't question whether Scorsese personally felt lonely and isolated as a child, but I don't feel loneliness and isolation on the screen—I see a bunch of exaggerated signifiers (Hugo is filthy and his clothes are worn and all the adults yell at him and he regularly gets chased by a scary dog!) and big beats, with shouting and weeping and Spielbergian wonder-emoting. For me, sincerity is more convincing and more personal when it's quiet and direct; when someone's shouting his opinions at me, I assume he's either really angry, or just trying to overwhelm my senses to keep me from expressing my own opinion. Hugo was one long shout, as far as I was concerned.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Why didn't I get that sense of fakery from Amélie, you ask? Actually, I did. I'll completely acknowledge that Amélie and Moulin Rouge are both big, manipulative, artificial constructions in the exact same vein, demanding specific emotions at specific intervals, and trying to sell those emotions with heavy emoting and aggressive soundtrack prodding. Neither of them really sold me on their emotions as authentic human feeling. What I enjoyed in those two films was the construction—particularly Amélie's heady, laughable lists of random characterizing features and experiences for its cast, and Moulin Rouge's musical-magpie mashups and recontextualizations. I'm often sold on stories that do creative or ambitious things with structure, and both of those movies qualify, where Hugo is a much more linear, standard kid-quest.<br/><br/>But in the end, for me, it really does come down to a feeling that those movies are goofs, whereas Hugo is meant to be taken seriously at every treacly moment. You don't think that's true—but you're simultaneously defending its integrity in terms of its absolutely authentic, rooted-in-Scorsese's-history emotion, and telling me I'm wrong, and he doesn't mean it to be taken seriously. How do you reconcile those two statements? What about the film suggests to you that it isn't meant to be taken at face value? And is it possible this is just another Curious Case Of Benjamin Button-like situation where I find the use of kids in big-budget films to be largely sappy and melodramatic, whereas you as a dad find it bypasses your cynicism and goes straight to your family-feeling?<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Scott: Not sure I meant that Scorsese doesn't mean to be taken seriously; it's just that he's chosen a whimsical vehicle through which to express a serious love of the movies. When you say, "But Hugo isn't primarily about film, in spite of the Méliès tie-ins," I'm mystified. I grant that you find many elements of Hugo overly familiar and laborious and full of Spielbergian wonder-emoting—there's nothing I can do to argue around that perception, which other Hugo doubters share. Sometimes a film means to charm and enchant, and it doesn't for some; you've got Hugo and I've got Amélie, though I think the latter, deliberately artificial as it is, means for us to find it romantic. (Rather than, say, some horrible mechanical contraption fit for a Saw sequel.)<br/><br/>But to say Hugo isn't primarily about film? If it's not about film, then it's the most pointlessly discursive story about [whatever you think it's about] I've ever seen. The relationship between Hugo and Méliès is the heart of the movie, and at the heart of that is not just some stock connection between Plucky Orphan and Crusty Old Guy With A Heart Of Gold, but a shared affinity for engineered magic—specifically the magic of the movies. I think Scorsese and his collaborators have found a way to express their enthusiasm over the early days of cinema through a fantasy that's accessible to all ages. The archetype-filled children's tale is the merely the crust here; cinema is the pie. (Mmmm… pie.)<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>As for The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button, I don't see much of a connection, other than trying to expose me as a Benjamin Button defender as a way of damaging my credibility. (Incidentally, how are the extras on that G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra Blu-ray?) I've said to you that the sleep-deprived new dad in me was perhaps vulnerable to Benjamin Button, but I can't imagine a time when the premise of aging in reverse wouldn't move me. (Cradling the love of your life in your arms as an infant? How can you not be affected by that?) And besides, I don't see how Benjamin Button relates much to Hugo as a film concerning kids, since that's just a small segment of a story that spans a much larger trajectory.<br/><br/>So have I convinced you? Likely not. But I'm happy to learn that Hugo wasn't entirely devoid of enchantments for you. The sequences on Méliès the filmmaker are what put Hugo over for me—and in that, at least, we can share some movie love.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Tasha: Nope, I can't say you've convinced me, any more than I've convinced you. It's impossible to argue anyone into a visceral love of anything, and it really should be equally impossible to talk someone down from visceral love. Mostly, you've let me see Hugo in Scott-O-Vision, which is an interesting experience; at least now I'm mildly convinced that we didn't somehow manage to see entirely different films which both somehow had the same name and director.<br/><br/>We certainly had different experiences, though, and to my mind, focused on different aspects of the production: I still don't see the "film is marvelous" theme as the movie's single strand, so much as one among too many. "Pointlessly discursive" almost covers it, though I'd throw in "often needlessly cutesy and precious" on top of that. While you're focused on the film's tasty pie filling, I feel like that pie was covered with a pound of crystallized sugar, and I think that does make a difference, regardless of the film's core message or handful of terrific scenes. See also Benjamin Button, which I did not bring up just to chafe you—I really do think you have more of a sentimental streak than I do regarding children in cinema, especially when they're used more as symbols of vulnerability and innocence than as human characters. Hey, you know what film totally does not have cute wide-eyed moppets bringing hope to a cynical world? G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra. Maybe I will go watch those Blu-ray extras. I could use some explosion-insulin to compensate for Hugo's sweetness. | Tout en reconnaissant qu'il est impossible de convaincre quelqu'un d'aimer quelque chose qu'il déteste, et vice versa, il est toujours souvent agréable de tenter l'argument.

Parce que peu importe ce que dit la radio, il y a toujours un juste milieu entre "Nous sommes tout à fait d'accord" et "J'ai raison, et vous êtes stupide et méchant."<br/><br/>Scott: Depuis que j'ai discuté de mon Scott Pilgrim Vs. L'apostasie mondiale, nous avons cherché un cas où je peux vous appeler pour ne pas aimer quelque chose de merveilleux, et nous n'avons pas eu à chercher longtemps. Nous étions assis l'un à côté de l'autre pendant l'Hugo-moi de Martin Scorsese, complètement enchantés par son hommage fantastique aux merveilles du cinéma muet primitif, et vous, en lui résistant apparemment à chaque tournant. Le consensus critique a été de mon côté: il a atteint la neuvième place de notre Top 15 collectif (bien que vous l'ayez répertorié comme votre choix surestimé), a remporté (ou placé) dans divers prix critiques de cinéma et bénéficie actuellement d'un score de 83 sur Metacritic. Cela ne veut pas dire que vous avez tort, bien sûr, mais il vous incombe d'expliquer pourquoi Hugo était, selon vos mots, «creux et artificiel», où beaucoup d'entre nous l'ont vu comme une belle évocation de l'enfance de Scorsese et du médium quand il était encore dans sa petite enfance. Et s'il vous plaît être doux que vous déchirer ce papillon par les ailes.<br/><br/>Publicité<br/><br/>Tasha: Je ne peux pas être douce, Scott. Parfois, ça fait moins mal si vous arrachez le pansement tout d'un coup. (Et même si ce n'est pas le cas, qui veut se promener avec un pansement à moitié déchiré? Gross.) Le fait est que j'ai trouvé que Hugo était un exercice fatiguant et manipulateur, à commencer par son ouverture à travers une gare de Paris, qui m'a rappelé plus que tout le Polar Express de Robert Zemeckis. Contrairement à Mike D'Angelo, je suis un fan de longues prises ininterrompues comme moyen d'établir un espace et d'encourager les téléspectateurs à retenir inconsciemment leur souffle lorsqu'une caméra explore une zone; mais lorsque l'espace exploré est une création CGI lisse et brillante, et que la caméra flotte sans aucun sentiment physique que la caméra ou l'environnement sont vraiment là, cette exploration commence à avoir l'impression de regarder quelqu'un d'autre jouer à un jeu vidéo. Et le reste du film me semblait tout aussi inepte et irréel, à la fois en termes de cadre et en termes de son histoire très artificielle et maussade.<br/><br/>Je n'ai pas nécessairement de problème avec les environnements stylisés et fabriqués dans les films. J'ai adoré la version tout aussi tentaculaire et tout à fait artificielle de Baz Luhrmann sur Paris au Moulin Rouge, par exemple, mais ce film a un sens de sa propre ridicule, un sens de l'humour sur la façon dont il est délibérément exagéré. Idem pour la stylisation de Jean-Pierre Jeunet, en particulier en Amélie. (Jeunet et Luhrmann étaient tous les deux de fortes influences visuelles ici.) J’ai cependant eu le sentiment que Martin Scorsese voulait que je prenne Hugo entièrement au sérieux. Même si c'est une autre histoire douloureusement sentimentale à propos d'un orphelin courageux ramenant de la couleur dans la vie d'un vieux grincheux.<br/><br/>Publicité<br/><br/>Il n'y a rien que j'aime plus que d'être surpris. Et il n'y a rien que je déteste et résiste plus que d'être ouvertement manipulé, d'être bruyamment dit quoi ressentir et quand le ressentir. Un bon film fait ce genre de chose subtilement; un mauvais utilise des indices de musique qui s'écrasent et des cordes douces - et dans ce cas, un orphelin crasseux, aux yeux énormes, ébouriffé regardant la caméra - pour demander du pathos et dire aux téléspectateurs qu'ils sont des gens horribles s'ils ne le servent pas à la demande. Cela dit, je peux faire face à des enfants tristes et à des adultes grincheux qui rendent la vie meilleure l’un pour l’autre – j’ai vraiment creusé le Havre de cette année, qui était essentiellement le même complot sans toute la gentillesse – mais je trouve que les environnements artificiels reflètent mal les émotions artificielles, et chacun fait paraître l’autre plus faux tour à tour.<br/><br/>Dans notre vidéo de films négligés, vous et Noel avez tous les deux pris Keith à partie pour avoir défendu Tyrannosaur, parce que vous pensiez que ce n'était pas assez réaliste - trop artificiel, trop miserablist, trop, trop loin. Comment est-il possible que vous ne puissiez pas acheter une vieille manivelle bloquée qui brise les choses quand il est en colère, mais vous pouvez acheter un orphelin vivant à l'intérieur d'une horloge de gare géante et se lancer dans un voyage fantaisiste pour réparer un automate mystérieux qui, selon lui, pourrait porter des secrets de son père mort, mais qui le conduit plutôt dans un voyage bizarre de découverte de soi, dans le pays magique du cinéma? N'avez-vous jamais trouvé le design rococo voyant d'Hugo, des cordes agressives ou des charges de brouettes, même un peu excessives ou difficiles à avaler?<br/><br/>Publicité<br/><br/>Scott: Jeunet et Luhrmann comme influences sur Scorsese?! Oubliez d'être indélicate, maintenant vous me piquez délibérément avec un bâton pointu. Si vous cherchez des inspirations pour Hugo – en effet, si vous cherchez le noyau émotionnel d’Hugo – vous devez retourner à l’enfance de Scorsese sur Elizabeth Street dans Little Italy, où un petit garçon asthmatique, incapable de jouer dehors avec les autres enfants, s’est retiré aux fantasmes d’Alexander Korda comme The Thief Of Bagdad. Ou, plus simplement, allez directement à la source elle-même: George Méliès, dont A Trip To The Moon reste le Big Bang de tous les fantasmes cinématographiques, ce moment où la caméra n’était pas utilisée pour documenter le monde tel qu’il est, mais quel que soit le lieu de transport lunatique, magique, qu’un cinéaste veut inventer pour cela. Et cette tradition a été développée et développée pendant des décennies avant que des gens comme Jeunet et Luhrmann n’y mettent leurs pattes.<br/><br/>Et en parlant de Jeunet, belle tentative de me prendre mon arme rhétorique, mais je vais le dire quand même: comment pouvez-vous aimer Amélie, mais trouver Hugo synthétique et "excessif" et "fatigemment manipulateur"? Vous dites qu'Amélie et le Moulin Rouge ont le « sens du ridicule » où Scorsese veut dire qu'on prend Hugo au sérieux, et je ne pense pas que ce soit le cas, du moins sur ce dernier point. Que Scorsese ressente une passion évidente pour les films est, je suppose, la raison pour laquelle vous interprétez Hugo comme sérieux, mais pour moi, ce sont ces sentiments qui donnent au film un ballast émotionnel que les films Luhrmann et Jeunet n'ont pas. Les trois films font un usage agressif des merveilles de CGI - et Scorsese ajoute la 3D au mélange, pour un effet merveilleux - mais où vous et moi différons est sur la question de l'apesanteur. Je suis d'accord que CGI a un effet d'éloignement; les mondes entièrement composés de pâte à modeler numérique sont flexibles au point où ils n'ont parfois aucune présence. Vous avez fait référence à Hugo dans votre entrée "Overrated" pour notre pièce Best Of Film comme "un gimcrack CGI" - une dis... parfaite pour un autre film.<br/><br/>Publicité<br/><br/>Il est juste de dire que Scorsese a construit Hugo autour d'un livre / film pour enfants standard: Orphan manque son papa, crée son propre petit monde fantastique, glousse un nouvel ami, convainc un vieux fuddy-duddy croustillant de s'adoucir et peut-être de l'adopter. Mais c'est juste le squelette narratif, et Scorsese fournit beaucoup de chair et de sang. D'une part, vous ne pouvez pas regarder Hugo, le garçon solitaire, regarder des tours de l'horloge à l'agitation d'une gare de Paris sans penser à Scorsese, un autre garçon solitaire, regardant par la fenêtre de sa chambre sur Elizabeth Street. Et même si vous n'êtes pas assez grand pour faire ce lien, j'ai vraiment l'impression que le voyage d'Hugo n'est pas de trouver une nouvelle figure paternelle, mais de persister dans la magie mécanique qui est l'héritage de son propre père. La persistance de la vision qui nous permet d'accepter une version illusoire du monde à 24 images par seconde est la science et la magie à la fois. La relation d'Hugo avec Méliès n'a pas pour but de le rapprocher d'un nouveau papa, mais de partager un enthousiasme commun que le vieil homme a submergé d'amertume. Pour moi, c'est un angle beaucoup plus unique sur une prémisse potentiellement usée.<br/><br/>Même les quelques détracteurs du film semblent prêts à admettre que les séquences évoquant l'histoire du cinéma et le studio de Méliès - avec Michael Stuhlbarg comme héros du cinéma ! - étaient formidables. Cela ressemblait, de la meilleure façon possible, à une compression enivrante de mon cours History Of Film 101 à l'université, condensant la valeur d'un semestre de clips et de contexte entre un montage et un livre pop-up animé. Et il parle de la conception ingénieuse du film, qui superpose si magnifiquement le fait et la fantaisie que c'est à la fois une histoire de Méliès et la naissance du cinéma, et juste le genre d'émerveillement cinématographique simple et somptueusement produit que Scorsese lui-même aurait aimé enfant. Dieu merci, Hugo ne suit pas le modèle Jeunet/Luhrmann et a « un sens de sa propre ridicule ». En tant que connaisseur de fantasy vous-même, ne diriez-vous pas qu'il est utile de le jouer droit, sérieux et sans vergogne plutôt que de faire un clin d'œil au public? Vous trouverez peut-être Hugo maladif, mais je ne pense pas que l'authenticité de son sentiment soit à nier.<br/><br/>Publicité<br/><br/>Tasha: Oui, j'ai en fait trouvé des parties d'Hugo enchanteresses. (Notez comment je réponds à votre question, alors que vous étiez trop occupé avec l'apoplexie pour aborder la mienne, bien que je suppose que c'est une réponse en soi. D'accord, "l'influence" surestime peut-être l'affaire - je voulais juste dire que le style visuel semblait très familier. Bien que, comme Keith l'a souligné lorsque vous l'avez évoqué en personne, Scorsese ne s'oppose ni à s'inspirer des visuels des autres, ni à y être immunisé.) Tout d’abord, j’ai été enchanté par les parties traitant de l’histoire de Georges Méliès, de son amour du cinéma, du travail qu’il a mis dans son art et de la joie qu’il en a tiré. Il y a beaucoup de beauté et de plaisir dans la mise en scène de la scène sous-marine de "Fairyland" de Méliès et dans la séquence à la fin, en se concentrant sur les images de Méliès. Je vous concède que la connexion d'Hugo avec Méliès sur un amour partagé du cinéma est une belle touche. Et j'apprécie un bon film sur le cinéma.<br/><br/>Mais Hugo n'est pas avant tout un film, malgré les liens de Méliès. En plus des thèmes que vous citez, il s'agit aussi de trouver votre but, comme les personnages l'expliquent expressément, laborieusement les uns aux autres et à nous. Et il s'agit de spectacle, et de grands décors d'action, et de poursuites, et de fins heureusement éternelles où même le tyran en colère et le couple plus âgé et timide, même le teckel grincheux, sont tous associés à de charmants intérêts amoureux à la fin. Il s'agit de la super-précoce Hermione Granger qui est autoritaire et perfide et intelligente et qui loue les mondes magiques enfermés dans les livres. Et tout cela est très familier et très artificiel.<br/><br/>Publicité<br/><br/>Oui, Scorsese joue avec les archétypes. Le problème est que je n'ai jamais senti qu'il les inculquait quelque chose de nouveau, de frais ou de crédible, malgré sa propre histoire. J’aurais beaucoup préféré une histoire d’un jeune Scorsese qui a grandi avec l’asthme – quelque chose de petit et réel, sans de vastes pièces pleines d’horlogerie CGI et de poussière dorée et de rêves prophétiques et une garde tyrannique adulte déchaînée avec un cœur d’or – tout ce non-sens démesuré et exagéré. Vous continuez à citer les antécédents personnels de Scorsese et son amour du film comme preuve qu'il ressent vraiment ce qu'il met sur l'écran, mais je ne ressens pas sa touche personnelle dans tout cela, sauf les moments qui sont expressément sur le film. Les émotions de base peuvent être réelles, mais cela ne rend pas l'exécution moins fausse.<br/><br/>Vous dites que l'authenticité de l'émotion ne doit pas être niée. Je ne me demande pas si Scorsese se sentait personnellement seul et isolé quand il était enfant, mais je ne me sens pas seul et isolé à l'écran - je vois un tas de signifiants exagérés (Hugo est sale et ses vêtements sont portés et tous les adultes lui crient dessus et il est régulièrement poursuivi par un chien effrayant!) et de gros battements, avec des cris et des pleurs et des émeutiers spielbergiens. Pour moi, la sincérité est plus convaincante et plus personnelle quand elle est calme et directe; quand quelqu'un me crie ses opinions, je suppose qu'il est soit vraiment en colère, soit qu'il essaie simplement de submerger mes sens pour m'empêcher d'exprimer ma propre opinion. Hugo était un long cri, en ce qui me concerne.<br/><br/>Publicité<br/><br/>Pourquoi n'ai-je pas eu ce sentiment de fausseté de la part d'Amélie ? Je reconnais complètement qu'Amélie et le Moulin Rouge sont tous deux de grandes constructions manipulatrices et artificielles dans le même sens, exigeant des émotions spécifiques à des intervalles spécifiques, et essayant de vendre ces émotions avec une forte émotion et une bande-son agressive. Aucun d'eux ne m'a vraiment vendu sur leurs émotions comme un sentiment humain authentique. Ce que j'ai aimé dans ces deux films, c'est la construction - en particulier les listes enivrantes et risible d'Amélie de traits et d'expériences de caractérisation aléatoires pour son casting, et les mashups et recontextualisations de comédies musicales du Moulin Rouge. Je suis souvent vendu sur des histoires qui font des choses créatives ou ambitieuses avec la structure, et ces deux films se qualifient, où Hugo est une kid-quest beaucoup plus linéaire et standard.<br/><br/>Mais en fin de compte, pour moi, cela se résume vraiment à un sentiment que ces films sont des idiots, alors que Hugo est censé être pris au sérieux à chaque instant. Vous ne pensez pas que c'est vrai - mais vous défendez simultanément son intégrité en termes d'émotion absolument authentique, enracinée dans l'histoire de Scorsese, et en me disant que j'ai tort, et il ne veut pas que cela soit pris au sérieux. Comment conciliez-vous ces deux affirmations ? Qu'en est-il du film qui vous suggère qu'il n'est pas censé être pris au pied de la lettre ? Et est-il possible que ce ne soit qu'une autre situation étrange comme celle de Benjamin Button où je trouve que l'utilisation des enfants dans les films à gros budget est en grande partie sadique et mélodramatique, alors que vous, en tant que père, trouvez que cela contourne votre cynisme et va directement à votre sentiment de famille?<br/><br/>Publicité<br/><br/>Scott: Je ne suis pas sûr de vouloir dire que Scorsese ne veut pas dire être pris au sérieux; c'est juste qu'il a choisi un véhicule fantaisiste à travers lequel exprimer un amour sérieux pour les films. Quand vous dites, "Mais Hugo n'est pas principalement sur le film, malgré les liens de Méliès," je suis mystifié. J'accorde que vous trouvez beaucoup d'éléments d'Hugo trop familiers et laborieux et pleins d'émerveillement spielbergien - il n'y a rien que je puisse faire pour argumenter autour de cette perception, que d'autres douteurs d'Hugo partagent. Parfois, un film signifie charmer et enchanter, et il ne le fait pas pour certains; vous avez Hugo et moi avons Amélie, bien que je pense que ce dernier, délibérément artificiel comme il est, signifie pour nous de le trouver romantique. (Plutôt que, disons, un engin mécanique horrible digne d'une suite de Saw.)<br/><br/>Mais pour dire qu'Hugo n'est pas principalement à propos de film, si ce n'est pas à propos de film, alors c'est l'histoire la plus inutilement discursive sur [quoi que vous pensiez que c'est à propos] que j'ai jamais vu. La relation entre Hugo et Méliès est au cœur du film, et au cœur de cela, il n’y a pas seulement une connexion entre Plucky Orphan et Crusty Old Guy With A Heart Of Gold, mais une affinité commune pour la magie artificielle, en particulier la magie des films. Je pense que Scorsese et ses collaborateurs ont trouvé un moyen d'exprimer leur enthousiasme au cours des premiers jours du cinéma à travers un fantasme qui est accessible à tous les âges. Le conte pour enfants rempli d'archétypes est simplement la croûte ici; le cinéma est la tarte. (Mmmm... tarte.)<br/><br/>Publicité<br/><br/>Quant à The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button, je ne vois pas grand chose d'autre que d'essayer de m'exposer en tant que défenseur de Benjamin Button comme un moyen de nuire à ma crédibilité. (Incidemment, comment sont les figurants sur ce G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra Blu-ray?) Je vous ai dit que le nouveau papa privé de sommeil en moi était peut-être vulnérable à Benjamin Button, mais je ne peux pas imaginer un moment où la prémisse du vieillissement à l'envers ne me dérangerait pas. Comment pouvez-vous ne pas être affecté par cela ?) Et d'ailleurs, je ne vois pas comment Benjamin Button se rapporte beaucoup à Hugo en tant que film concernant les enfants, car ce n'est qu'un petit segment d'une histoire qui s'étend sur une trajectoire beaucoup plus grande.<br/><br/>Mais je suis heureux d'apprendre qu'Hugo n'était pas totalement dépourvu d'enchantements pour vous. Les séquences sur Méliès le cinéaste sont ce qui a mis Hugo au-dessus pour moi - et en cela, au moins, nous pouvons partager un peu d'amour de film.<br/><br/>Publicité<br/><br/>Tasha: Non, je ne peux pas dire que vous m'avez convaincu, pas plus que je ne vous ai convaincu. Il est impossible de convaincre quelqu'un d'un amour viscéral de quoi que ce soit, et il devrait être tout aussi impossible de parler à quelqu'un de l'amour viscéral. La plupart du temps, vous m'avez laissé voir Hugo dans Scott-O-Vision, ce qui est une expérience intéressante; au moins maintenant, je suis légèrement convaincu que nous n'avons pas réussi à voir des films entièrement différents qui avaient tous deux le même nom et le même réalisateur.<br/><br/>Cependant, nous avons certainement eu des expériences différentes, et à mon avis, nous nous sommes concentrés sur différents aspects de la production: je ne vois toujours pas le thème du "film est merveilleux" comme le seul volet du film, autant qu'un parmi trop. "Inutilement discursive" le couvre presque, bien que je jette "souvent inutilement mignonne et précieuse" en plus de cela. Pendant que vous vous concentrez sur le remplissage savoureux de tarte du film, j'ai l'impression que cette tarte était recouverte d'une livre de sucre cristallisé, et je pense que cela fait une différence, quel que soit le message principal du film ou une poignée de scènes formidables. Voir aussi Benjamin Button, que je n'ai pas évoqué juste pour vous insulter - je pense vraiment que vous avez plus une tendance sentimentale que moi en ce qui concerne les enfants au cinéma, surtout quand ils sont utilisés plus comme symboles de vulnérabilité et d'innocence que comme personnages humains. Hey, vous savez quel film n'a pas de mignons moppets aux yeux écarquillés qui apportent de l'espoir à un monde cynique? G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra. Peut-être que je vais aller regarder ces extras Blu-ray. Je pourrais utiliser de l'insuline explosive pour compenser la douceur d'Hugo. |
| "I hoped my daughter would be free from difficult and troubling times": Mee Mee's story as a refugee Mom<br/><br/>Hope in Times of Crisis: A Mother's Day Story<br/><br/>By Judith Santiago*<br/><br/>Mee Mee heard that the soldiers were coming. She took hold of her son and frantically joined the rest of the villagers who were running toward the Thai-Burmese border, where the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) was located. Her husband was in another village running in the opposite direction, Mee later learned. After the soldiers' pursuit ended, Mee returned home to her small village in Koechi, Burma.<br/><br/>During 1997-2000, Mee and thousands like her lived under the constant threat of violence from Burmese soldiers. Many people would take temporary refuge in the jungle, and return home to their village after soldiers left the area, just to do it all over again days later. About once a week, Mee and others would be on the move to avoid capture, rape, or death by soldiers.<br/><br/>During one incident, Mee's husband ran ahead of his wife to secure food for his family. Her husband was spotted by soldiers and shot. The bullet shattered a portion of his ribcage, leaving him severely wounded and in distress as he journeyed toward the jungle with his family for safety.<br/><br/>For three months, Mee's husband hid and moved the family with an exasperating wound at his side. He received no medical care, except for Mee's tending.<br/><br/>"I was afraid to return to Burma," Mee said through an interpreter. "I feared dying. I cried and cried every day," she continued.<br/><br/>Mee's husband eventually drew enough strength to walk five days toward a small village in Thailand where they learned the location of a hospital and a refugee camp. When Mee and her husband finally arrived at the hospital, he underwent immediate surgery and later recovered.<br/><br/>Symbol of Hope<br/><br/>Life in the jungle for those fleeing Burmese soldiers was indeed terrifying and difficult. Makeshift bamboo tents with only roof and floor coverings became suitable temporary dwellings. Many women including Mee gave birth to children in the jungle. Mee's then six-year-old son assisted in the delivery of his sister named Eh Ku Hser. Her name means love – cold – sweet. "Cold" in Burmese culture means so as to not pass through the fire of life, as heat represents troubled times.<br/><br/>"I hoped my daughter would be free from difficult and troubling times," said Mee. "I did not want her to go through what I had experienced," she continued.<br/><br/>For Mee, the birth of her daughter in the midst of darkness, torment and fear, was a symbol of hope for a new life to come. Hope in times of crisis, the very premise of the United Methodist Committee on Relief's (UMCOR) newly co-branded UMCOR-Prosperity Candle, is also the essence of that which candles shed light upon.<br/><br/>A New Beginning<br/><br/>With the help of UNHCR, hope for a new life did indeed materialize for Mee and her family when they resettled in West Springfield, Massachusetts. There, Mee met Moo Kho Paw, another woman who emigrated from Burma, and who was working at Prosperity Candle in Florence. The organization helps refugee women who have escaped areas of conflict rebuild their lives through the art of candle making. Moo Kho recommended that Mee join the organization, and Mee gladly accepted.<br/><br/>"I was excited to be out of the house," said Mee, "I was raised to believe that because I was a woman, my role was to remain at home and raise my family," she continued. "While many Burmese women want to do more for themselves, they are often encouraged to remain homemakers."<br/><br/>Today, Mee has plans to go into the candle-making business for herself and support her five children, but she expressed the need to learn English first.<br/><br/>"In the Thai refugee camp, we had education, but it was not so good," said Mee. "When I was a child, I wanted to go to school, but I was told to stay home because I was a woman. Now, I have hopes for my daughters to go to college and become doctors or policewomen," continued Mee.<br/><br/>Mee has struck an even balance in her life that she wishes others would have found—a simple, happy life where work, caring for family members and freedom of choice all have their place.<br/><br/>Support Refugee Women in the US<br/><br/>Share this Mother's Day story with your loved ones. And, when you purchase handmade candles by Mee, Moo Kho, and Naw, another Burmese refugee woman working at Prosperity Candle , know you are helping to support their livelihood as they rebuild their lives and those of their family members in the US. | "J'espérais que ma fille serait libérée des moments difficiles et troublants": l'histoire de Mee Mee en tant que mère réfugiée<br/><br/>L'espoir en temps de crise: une histoire de la fête des mères<br/><br/>Par Judith Santiago*<br/><br/>Mee Mee apprit que les soldats arrivaient. Elle s’empara de son fils et rejoignit frénétiquement le reste des villageois qui couraient vers la frontière entre la Thaïlande et le Myanmar, où se trouvait le Haut-Commissariat des Nations Unies pour les réfugiés (HCR). Plus tard, Mee apprend que son mari se trouve dans un autre village et qu'après la fin de la poursuite des soldats, Mee rentre chez elle dans son petit village de Koechi, en Birmanie.<br/><br/>En 1997-2000, Mee et des milliers de personnes comme elle ont vécu sous la menace constante de la violence des soldats birmans. Beaucoup de gens se réfugiaient temporairement dans la jungle et rentraient chez eux dans leur village après que les soldats aient quitté la région, juste pour tout recommencer quelques jours plus tard. Environ une fois par semaine, Mee et d'autres se déplaçaient pour éviter la capture, le viol ou la mort par des soldats.<br/><br/>Au cours d'un incident, le mari de Mee a couru devant sa femme pour obtenir de la nourriture pour sa famille. La balle a brisé une partie de sa cage thoracique, le laissant grièvement blessé et en détresse alors qu'il se dirigeait vers la jungle avec sa famille pour sa sécurité.<br/><br/>Pendant trois mois, le mari de Mee s'est caché et a déplacé la famille avec une blessure exaspérante à ses côtés. Il n'a reçu aucun soin médical, sauf pour s'occuper de Mee.<br/><br/>"J'avais peur de retourner en Birmanie", a-t-elle dit par l'intermédiaire d'un interprète. "J'avais peur de mourir. J'ai pleuré et pleuré tous les jours", a-t-elle poursuivi.<br/><br/>Le mari de Mee a finalement tiré assez de force pour marcher cinq jours vers un petit village en Thaïlande où ils ont appris l'emplacement d'un hôpital et d'un camp de réfugiés. Lorsque Mee et son mari sont finalement arrivés à l'hôpital, il a subi une intervention chirurgicale immédiate et s'est ensuite rétabli.<br/><br/>Symbole de l'espoir<br/><br/>La vie dans la jungle pour ceux qui fuyaient les soldats birmans était en effet terrifiante et difficile. Des tentes en bambou de fortune avec seulement des toits et des revêtements de sol sont devenues des habitations temporaires convenables. Beaucoup de femmes, y compris Mee, ont donné naissance à des enfants dans la jungle. Le fils de Mee, alors âgé de six ans, a aidé à l'accouchement de sa sœur, Eh Ku Hser. Son nom signifie amour - froid - doux. "froid" dans la culture birmane signifie pour ne pas passer à travers le feu de la vie, car la chaleur représente des temps troublés.<br/><br/>"J'espérais que ma fille serait libérée des moments difficiles et troublants", a déclaré Mee. "Je ne voulais pas qu'elle traverse ce que j'avais vécu", a-t-elle poursuivi.<br/><br/>Pour Mee, la naissance de sa fille au milieu des ténèbres, des tourments et de la peur, était un symbole d’espoir pour une nouvelle vie à venir. L'espoir en temps de crise, la prémisse même de la bougie UMCOR-Prospérité du Comité Méthodiste Uni sur le Secours (UMCOR), nouvellement co-marquée, est aussi l'essence de ce sur quoi les bougies éclairent.<br/><br/>Un nouveau départ<br/><br/>Avec l'aide du HCR, l'espoir d'une nouvelle vie s'est en effet concrétisé pour Mee et sa famille lorsqu'ils se sont réinstallés à West Springfield, dans le Massachusetts. Là, Mee a rencontré Moo Kho Paw, une autre femme qui a émigré de Birmanie et qui travaillait chez Prosperity Candle à Florence. L’organisation aide les femmes réfugiées qui ont fui les zones de conflit à reconstruire leur vie grâce à l’art de la fabrication de bougies. Moo Kho a recommandé que Mee rejoigne l'organisation, et Mee a accepté avec plaisir.<br/><br/>"J'étais excitée d'être hors de la maison", a déclaré Mee, "j'ai été élevée à croire que parce que j'étais une femme, mon rôle était de rester à la maison et d'élever ma famille. « Alors que de nombreuses femmes birmanes veulent faire plus pour elles-mêmes, elles sont souvent encouragées à rester des femmes au foyer. »<br/><br/>Aujourd'hui, Mee a l'intention de se lancer dans la fabrication de bougies et de subvenir aux besoins de ses cinq enfants, mais elle a exprimé le besoin d'apprendre d'abord l'anglais.<br/><br/>« Dans le camp de réfugiés thaïlandais, nous avions reçu une éducation, mais ce n'était pas si bon », a déclaré Mee. « Quand j'étais enfant, je voulais aller à l'école, mais on m'a dit de rester à la maison parce que j'étais une femme. Maintenant, j'ai l'espoir que mes filles iront à l'université et deviendront des médecins ou des policières », a poursuivi Mee.<br/><br/>Mee a atteint un équilibre égal dans sa vie qu’elle aurait souhaité que les autres trouvent – une vie simple et heureuse où le travail, les soins aux membres de la famille et la liberté de choix ont tous leur place.<br/><br/>Soutenir les femmes réfugiées aux États-Unis<br/><br/>Partagez cette histoire de la fête des mères avec vos proches. Et, lorsque vous achetez des bougies faites à la main par Mee, Moo Kho et Naw, une autre femme réfugiée birmane travaillant chez Prosperity Candle, sachez que vous aidez à subvenir à leurs besoins alors qu’ils reconstruisent leur vie et celle des membres de leur famille aux États-Unis. |
| The Precedency Essay<br/><br/>1562 words - 7 pages<br/><br/>Affirmative action is a government policy that gives opportunities to minorities, women, and any group who has been the victim of discrimination in the past. Affirmative action is the outcome of the 1960's Civil Rights movement, growing out of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 which outlawed discrimination based on race, ethnicity, or gender. It was the 1978 Supreme Court decision, The Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, which allowed for the use of race-based preferences as a means of fostering diversity, allowing affirmative action to be used in admissions policies. It was created with the intention to provide equal opportunities for members of minority groups in education and ...view middle of the document...<br/><br/>However, according to a 2007 report by the Pew Research Center, support for affirmative action among the American public has actually increased substantiallyin recent years, climbing from 58% in 1995 to 70% in 2007. Supporters of affirmative action make many arguments in support of affirmative action, in the hopes of getting others to see the genuine good that affirmative actin policies bring to our society. Supporters believe that affirmative action is more of a process rather than an admissions policy. Colleges and universities take the extra initiative to reach out to minority groups, encouraging them to apply. Colleges and universities offer additional financial aid and provide on-campus resources to help better the student's college education. Supporters also note the rising number of minority applications to colleges and universities due in part to affirmative action policies.<br/>Statistics have proven that when affirmative action is eliminated, such as when it was at Berkley College and UCLA in 1998, the minority student admissions fell 61 percent and 36 percent respectively, proving that affirmative action plays a major role in a minority students college admissions process. Affirmative action supporters also believe that diversity in higher education provides a better educational atmosphere for all students, personally and intellectually. If affirmative action were to be eliminated, there would be fewer minority students enrolled in colleges, causing diversity to be fairly slim. Affirmative action policies are also necessary in order to compensate for centuries of racial, economic, and social oppression. Individuals with a higher socioeconomic status have more opportunities than those of lower socioeconomic backgrounds. Supporters believe that certain racial or ethnic groups are disadvantaged because they are frequently in lower income households and consequently are not exposed to the same resources as students from higher socioeconomic classes. Advocates support the notion of competition between students based on merit, but argue that affirmative action compensates for economic differences. College graduates, who have benefitted from affirmative action, have also said that they received better jobs, earned more money, and overall live better lives because of the fortunate opportunities they received through affirmative action.<br/>Supporters of affirmative action continuously stress the severe importance of affirmative action, considering its contributions to enhancing both the college experience and society in general. However, opponents of affirmative action believe that the time has come to end affirmative action. Opponents believe affirmative action was created to ensure fair admission practices to bring change to a long period of racial discrimination. They believe the policy is outdated."It's time to pull the plug on race-based decision making," says Ward Connerly, a Sacramento, California businessman and lead organizer of...<br/><br/>Find Another Essay On The Precedency<br/><br/>754 words - 4 pages<br/>of the burden to continue prospering.

Il a été créé avec l'intention d'offrir des chances égales aux membres des groupes minoritaires dans l'éducation et ... voir au milieu du document ...<br/><br/>Cependant, selon un rapport de 2007 du Pew Research Center, le soutien à l'action positive parmi le public américain a considérablement augmenté ces dernières années, passant de 58% en 1995 à 70% en 2007. Les partisans de l'action positive avancent de nombreux arguments en faveur de l'action positive, dans l'espoir d'amener les autres à voir le véritable bien que les politiques d'action positive apportent à notre société. Les collèges et les universités prennent l'initiative supplémentaire de tendre la main aux groupes minoritaires, en les encourageant à postuler. Les collèges et les universités offrent une aide financière supplémentaire et fournissent des ressources sur le campus pour aider à améliorer l'éducation collégiale de l'étudiant. Les partisans notent également le nombre croissant de demandes d'admission de minorités dans les collèges et les universités, en partie à cause des politiques d'action positive.<br/>Les statistiques ont prouvé que lorsque l'action positive est éliminée, comme quand il était à Berkley College et UCLA en 1998, les admissions des étudiants minoritaires ont diminué de 61 pour cent et 36 pour cent respectivement, ce qui prouve que l'action positive joue un rôle majeur dans un processus d'admission des étudiants minoritaires. Les partisans de l'action positive croient également que la diversité dans l'enseignement supérieur offre une meilleure atmosphère éducative pour tous les étudiants, personnellement et intellectuellement. Si l'action positive devait être éliminée, il y aurait moins d'étudiants appartenant à des minorités inscrits dans les collèges, ce qui rendrait la diversité assez mince. Des politiques d'action positive sont également nécessaires pour compenser des siècles d'oppression raciale, économique et sociale. Les personnes ayant un statut socio-économique plus élevé ont plus de possibilités que celles de milieux socio-économiques inférieurs. Les partisans estiment que certains groupes raciaux ou ethniques sont désavantagés parce qu'ils appartiennent souvent à des ménages à faible revenu et ne sont donc pas exposés aux mêmes ressources que les étudiants des classes socio-économiques supérieures. Les défenseurs soutiennent la notion de concurrence entre les étudiants basée sur le mérite, mais soutiennent que l'action positive compense les différences économiques. Les diplômés des collèges, qui ont bénéficié de l'action positive, ont également déclaré qu'ils recevaient de meilleurs emplois, gagnaient plus d'argent et vivaient globalement mieux en raison des opportunités heureuses qu'ils recevaient grâce à l'action positive.<br/>Les partisans de l'action positive soulignent continuellement l'importance de l'action positive, compte tenu de ses contributions à l'amélioration de l'expérience du collège et de la société en général. Cependant, les opposants à l ' action positive estiment que le moment est venu de mettre fin à cette pratique et que celle-ci a été mise en place pour garantir des pratiques d ' admission équitables afin d ' apporter des changements à une longue période de discrimination raciale. Ils croient que la politique est dépassée. » Il est temps de mettre un terme à la prise de décision fondée sur la race », explique Ward Connerly, un homme d'affaires de Sacramento, en Californie, et organisateur principal de l'événement.<br/><br/>Trouver un autre essai sur la préséance<br/><br/>Bien que Jackson ait tout créé et signé pour l'Indian Removal Act, la loi ne serait entrée en vigueur qu'après la préséance de Jackson.<br/>L'idée d'avoir une banque nationale était une nouvelle proposition américaine dans les années 1800.

| Combinations<br/><br/>Combinations Are defenses against a punch, choreographed responses to different types of attacks. They have many names across the martial arts but (in my experience) every art has a version of them. This makes them different than forms because there are plenty of martial arts that have no forms. What makes there partner exercises so universal? Why practice a specific response when (in reality) timing, type of attack, size of the attacker, and a hundred other factors will make it so you never use that entire choreographed response? And finally, how can we practice for a real defense situation and avoid injury at the same time?<br/><br/>The universality of combinations is impressive, to say the least. Our style of Kenpo karate has a list of 108 combos that can be learned. (Most students only learn 20-30 though) In Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu you spend whole classes practicing arm bars and chokes, learning every subtlety to the move while your partner offers little to no resistance. Every boxer has spent hours in front of the bag and/or mirror throwing the same combination of punches until their body moves by reflex alone. Combinations are universal because we have no better way to introduce movement and then practice the subtle positions required to make them work. Hitting a small pressure point through clothing takes A LOT of practice, catching an arm bar with control requires a carefully placed hip and a sneaky setup, and a great combination is only useful if you can through it from a balanced and protected position. Can you think of a better way to gain these skills?<br/><br/>There is any number of factors that determine how you respond to an attack and whether in a sparring match or in a fight, I have NEVER used a full combination in my defense. Why, then, do we spend hours practicing them? We practice these choreographed responses because the objective is not to pull combination 8 out every time you see a hook punch but to show you one way of blocking it and then a possible way to follow it up. I have never chosen to use combination 3 in a reality situation but the block is one of my go-to moves. Combinations add tools to the toolbox they do not fix the car.<br/><br/>The last question is a question of safety. If we practice for the sake of reality we need to replicate reality. How do we prevent injury while doing so? When it comes down to it, it's about building trust. We start slow and learn to trust that we have control over ourselves. We learn to trust our partners have control as well. In more time we learn to trust our control over our partner and (a little scarier) we learn to trust our partner's control over us. In the end (with a lot of practice) you can move are full speed, tossing your partner, and being thrown without fear of injury.<br/><br/>Combinations are universal for a reason; they are practiced so they can be dissected into their parts, and we stay safe by starting slow and building trust. As with everything else in the martial arts, combinations have many reasons behind their practice and execution. | Combinaisons<br/><br/>Les combinaisons sont des défenses contre un coup de poing, des réponses chorégraphiées à différents types d'attaques. Ils ont de nombreux noms à travers les arts martiaux, mais (selon mon expérience) chaque art en a une version. Cela les rend différents des formes parce qu'il y a beaucoup d'arts martiaux qui n'ont pas de formes. Qu'est-ce qui rend les exercices de partenaire si universels? Pourquoi pratiquer une réponse spécifique quand (en réalité) le timing, le type d’attaque, la taille de l’attaquant et une centaine d’autres facteurs feront en sorte que vous n’utilisiez jamais toute cette réponse chorégraphiée ? Et enfin, comment pouvons-nous nous entraîner pour une situation de défense réelle et éviter des blessures en même temps?<br/><br/>L'universalité des combinaisons est impressionnante, c'est le moins que l'on puisse dire. Notre style de karaté Kenpo a une liste de 108 combos que l'on peut apprendre. (La plupart des étudiants n’apprennent que 20 à 30) Dans le jiu-jitsu brésilien, vous passez des cours entiers à pratiquer les barres de bras et les étouffements, à apprendre toutes les subtilités du mouvement tandis que votre partenaire offre peu ou pas de résistance. Chaque boxeur a passé des heures devant le sac et / ou le miroir à lancer la même combinaison de coups de poing jusqu'à ce que son corps bouge par réflexe seul. Les combinaisons sont universelles parce que nous n’avons pas de meilleur moyen d’introduire le mouvement et de pratiquer ensuite les positions subtiles requises pour les faire fonctionner. Toucher un petit point de pression à travers les vêtements prend beaucoup de pratique, attraper une barre de bras avec contrôle nécessite une hanche soigneusement placée et une configuration sournoise, et une excellente combinaison n'est utile que si vous pouvez le faire à partir d'une position équilibrée et protégée. Pouvez-vous imaginer une meilleure façon d'acquérir ces compétences?<br/><br/>Il y a un certain nombre de facteurs qui déterminent comment vous réagissez à une attaque et que ce soit dans un match de sparring ou dans un combat, je n'ai JAMAIS utilisé une combinaison complète dans ma défense. Pourquoi, alors, passons-nous des heures à les pratiquer? Nous pratiquons ces réponses chorégraphiées parce que l’objectif n’est pas de tirer la combinaison 8 à chaque fois que vous voyez un coup de crochet, mais de vous montrer une façon de le bloquer et ensuite une façon possible de le suivre. Je n'ai jamais choisi d'utiliser la combinaison 3 dans une situation de réalité, mais le bloc est l'un de mes coups de go-to. Combinaisons ajouter des outils à la boîte à outils, ils ne fixent pas la voiture.<br/><br/>La dernière question est une question de sécurité. Si nous pratiquons pour le bien de la réalité, nous devons reproduire la réalité. Comment pouvons-nous prévenir les blessures tout en le faisant? Quand il s'agit de cela, il s'agit de construire la confiance. Nous commençons lentement et apprenons à faire confiance que nous avons le contrôle sur nous-mêmes. Nous apprenons à faire confiance que nos partenaires ont le contrôle aussi. Plus de temps nous apprenons à faire confiance à notre contrôle sur notre partenaire et (un peu plus effrayant) nous apprenons à faire confiance au contrôle de notre partenaire sur nous. En fin de compte (avec beaucoup de pratique), vous pouvez vous déplacer à pleine vitesse, lancer votre partenaire et être jeté sans crainte de blessure.<br/><br/>Les combinaisons sont universelles pour une raison; elles sont pratiquées afin qu'elles puissent être disséquées dans leurs parties, et nous restons en sécurité en commençant lentement et en construisant la confiance. Comme pour tout le reste dans les arts martiaux, les combinaisons ont de nombreuses raisons derrière leur pratique et leur exécution. |
