| Leclaire<br/><br/>The historic Leclaire neighborhood, once referred to as Edwardsville's "suburb to the south," was founded as a cooperative community in 1890 and remained a separate village until annexed to the city of Edwardsville in 1934. Newspapers and magazines throughout the United States and Europe reported on the Leclaire experiment, particularly during the first 20 years of its existence. In 1979, due to its unique history, the former village was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.<br/><br/>Leclaire was founded by Nelson Oliver Nelson, a St. Louis plumbing manufacturer who, for many years, sought to advance the plight of the working class. Nelson wanted to improve working conditions for his employees and provide housing near the factories so workers and their families could easily participate in recreational and educational programs offered free of charge by the company. Prior to 1890, while still in St. Louis, the N. O. Nelson Company's manufacturing and distribution businesses began providing profit sharing along with educational and recreational opportunities. The Leclaire cooperative experiment would bring additional benefits.<br/><br/>When Nelson employees indicated they wanted to relocate to a rural location, company representatives approached leaders of small towns in several Missouri and Illinois communities near their St. Louis headquarters. They were looking for a suitable property to build new factories and a model village. South of Edwardsville they found a 125-acre tract of land with access to water, coal, and transportation. Local businessmen acted quickly to offer a financial incentive. In less than three weeks, the community raised a fund of $20,000 from individual contributions of between $1 and $1,000 to entice Nelson to choose Edwardsville for his enterprise.<br/><br/>City leaders had hoped to locate property inside the city limits of Edwardsville, but when no suitable site could be found, they were confident that the Nelson investment south of town would soon become a part of Edwardsville. Although Nelson fulfilled all the contingencies for construction and job creation in his contract, it would be 44 years before annexation to Edwardsville. Leclaire, bounded by Madison/Brown Avenues to the east, the railroad tracks to the west, Hadley/McKinley Avenues on the south and Wolf Street to the north, remained an independent village from 1890 to 1934. During that time it earned a reputation for innovations in business, education and residential planning.<br/><br/>The village of Leclaire on a 1931 map of Edwardsville<br/>Courtesy of Paul Jenkins<br/><br/>Nelson's decision to build a village was not made on a whim. By the late 1880s he was an international leader in the fields of cooperation and profit-sharing, exchanging social theories with others around the world while expanding his St. Louis business. He named his experimental village after the Parisian profit-sharer, Edme Jean Leclaire, but he visited many other social visionaries who provided information and inspiration. Compiling the best ideas from these examples, Nelson founded Leclaire to, in his words, "give work, promote intelligence, provide recreation, foster beauty, and make homes." These were all factors he determined necessary for men to lead fulfilling lives. Later writers used these words to formulate Leclaire's founding principles: Work, Homes, Education, Recreation, and Beauty, but with the additional important principle of Freedom.<br/><br/>Work<br/><br/>Work could be considered the most important of these factors since without the factory jobs in Leclaire, there would be no village. The brick factory buildings were designed by architect E. A. Cameron to provide natural light, ventilation in the summer, and heated floors in the winter. There was a fire suppression system and, although industrial accidents were not eliminated, every effort was made to guarantee the safety of the workers. The ivy-covered brick buildings were surrounded by well-manicured lawns and flower gardens giving the complex a campus-like appearance. In 1894, New York World reporter Nellie Bly called the buildings "the ideal perfection of buildings for man to labor in".<br/><br/>The manufacturing complex of the N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company in Leclaire<br/>From Friends of Leclaire<br/><br/>Nelson company policies were designed to protect the financial stability of employees. Workers could earn a share of the profits and have a voice in the company if they chose that option. The profit-sharing plan gave Nelson employees a pride of ownership that resulted in a supportive workforce. There were a few short-lived labor strikes over the years, but for the most part, labor problems were rare. Workers also had reasonable hours and competitive wages. There was a provident fund that provided for pensions and sick leave, as well as widow pensions if a worker died, whether or not the death was related to his employment.<br/><br/>Company headquarters for the N. O. Nelson Company (NONCO) remained in St. Louis, but all of the N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company was moved to Leclaire. The manufacturing company was divided into shops that made a variety of products. In 1900, the shops became independent companies for tax purposes, but all were still owned by the N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company. The shops included the Cabinet Mill where wood products from cabinetry to millwork were produced. The skilled craftsmen that worked here also fulfilled special contracts, including teller cages for a local bank and an altar still in use at St. Andrew's Episcopal Church in Edwardsville. The Marble Shop specialized in architectural marble that was cut and installed by Nelson crews in homes, businesses, and even state capitols throughout the Midwest. The Machine Shop, which became Bignall and Keeler, made pipe fitting machines, pumps, gauges, and various mechanical tools expected in the plumbing trade. They also branched out to manufacture specialty items like the Leclaire Bicycle in the mid-1890s. The Brass Shop included a foundry where various plumbing pipes and tools were manufactured. These examples represent just some of the work done in the Leclaire factories. The company's logo was a stylized "NONCO" that can still be seen on plumbing fixtures and some fire hydrants in Edwardsville today.<br/><br/>Homes<br/><br/>Before homes could be built, housing was needed for workers who were completing the factory buildings as well as building homes. To meet those needs, the company built the "Club House," a large building that served many purposes. In addition to lodging, it was the community's first educational building, and it contained a well-stocked library.<br/><br/>Construction of the residential portion of Leclaire began immediately after the village was founded in June of 1890. Julius Pitzman, the innovative landscape architect who laid out the first lots in Leclaire, set them up with a number of protective covenants. The covenants provided for wide, curvilinear streets, large lots, and a deed restriction that limited the properties to residential or educational purposes only. The company paved the streets, provided electric street lights, installed sidewalks, and planted hundreds of trees along the streets of Leclaire. Later sections of Leclaire were laid out with a conventional grid design and smaller lots, but still included the deed restrictions.<br/><br/>A Leclaire Victorian cottage in 1907<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Initially the homes were built by the company and then sold at near cost to Nelson employees to encourage home ownership. If a worker became ill and could not make his mortgage, payments were suspended until after he returned to work. The homes were offered in a variety of house designs and the company advertised that no two dwellings were alike. The earliest homes were primarily Victorian cottages that came with electricity and running water. These were followed by bungalows, foursquares, and even some kit homes. Residents could purchase a company-built home or buy an empty lot and build a house themselves, provided the architectural design met company standards.<br/><br/>In later years, lots were sold to investors, usually Edwardsville residents, and many homes in the 1920s were built by local contractors who then sold them to area residents.<br/><br/>Education<br/><br/>Nelson believed in education for everyone, including the working class. Educational programming began with a kindergarten at the Club House in 1892 and continued in the new educational building at 722 Holyoake Road. Commonly called the "School House," this building provided a large hall for meetings and programs, but had moveable partitions to divide it into classroom space during the day. In the evenings, there were dances, meetings, or programs of the Leclaire Self-Culture Club which featured weekly lectures by Washington University professors or nationally known speakers who, like N. O. Nelson, were part of the social betterment movement at the turn of the century. These included Jane Addams, Edward Everett Hale, Samuel "Golden Rule" Jones, and author Charlotte Perkins Gilman, among others.<br/><br/>Children enrolled in the Leclaire kindergarten in 1913<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>In the ten years following the 1895 construction of the education building, there were a series of educational experiments including an industrial school, college, night school, and an academy. The earliest and longest-lived endeavor was the morning kindergarten, founded in 1892, that used the Fröbel Model. This two-year program was free to everyone, including Edwardsville children, until 1931 when for financial reasons the company began charging tuition to students who were not the children of employees. Nelson Manufacturing operated a kindergarten until 1934 when the building was turned over to the Edwardsville School District for a nominal fee.<br/><br/>Recreation<br/><br/>Boaters on Leclaire Lake in 1915<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Recreation was an important feature of Leclaire. The company provided sports facilities for baseball, tennis, and later, football. A bowling and billiard hall was constructed and there was a lake for boating, swimming, fishing, or ice skating in winter. Leclaire Park was furnished with boathouses, male & female bath houses, and a large pavilion. Residents organized dances, hayrides, spelling bees, and other activities, and the company sponsored a band that played regularly at entertainments in the village or in Edwardsville. Like the educational functions at the Club House and School House, the recreational facilities at Leclaire were open to all and were often a destination for Edwardsville and even St. Louis visitors.<br/><br/>Beauty<br/><br/>Early photograph of Leclaire Lake<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>The last of the factors Nelson deemed important for a satisfying life concerned the environment. Nelson knew about the importance of healthy living. He valued the beauty and cleanliness that could be found in the country, and encouraged all in Leclaire to beautify their property by planting gardens and orchards. Nelson himself led by example, so a company greenhouse provided free flowers and competitions were held for the most beautiful yards. Leclaire was laid out so that the entire village had a park-like setting still evident today.<br/><br/>Freedom<br/><br/>The Leclaire Cooperative store<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Nelson listed five founding principles for Leclaire, but modern writers add a sixth: Freedom. All of the programs offered by the company were available to employees as well as local residents, but none were mandatory. The freedom to choose whether or not to participate in company programs was entirely up to the individual. Residents of Leclaire could work for Nelson Manufacturing or elsewhere, and workers were under no obligation to live in Leclaire. Participation in recreational and educational programs was also optional. There was also a company store where employees could shop, but unlike other company towns, no one was in debt to the company store. The Leclaire Store was a cooperative where members were charged fair market prices, but were then paid quarterly dividends.<br/><br/>A Different Company Town<br/><br/>All of these benefits made Leclaire unique from other company towns. But there were also individual instances where the company showed compassion and care for the employees. The company closed the factories and hired excursion trains to take workers and their families to St. Louis for a day at the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair. When money was tight, Nelson would occasionally place extra cash in each pay envelope to make life easier for workers, and if he instituted a program the men did not agree with, they talked it out and, as often as not, Nelson would reverse himself.<br/><br/>Born in Lillesand, Norway, in 1841, N. O. Nelson was a complicated man. He was a capitalist who believed in free enterprise, but also a socialist, a follower of the "Golden Rule", and a patriot who served for the Union in the Civil War. By 1900, he was a multimillionaire, but by the time of his death in 1922, he had given it all away for the betterment of the working class.<br/><br/>Although Leclaire was not Nelson's only social experiment, it is considered his most successful endeavor. Other major efforts for social betterment included a chain of co-operative grocery stores in New Orleans, a kindergarten for the children of black employees in his Bessemer, Alabama, factories, and a home for consumptives in Indio, California.<br/><br/>Nelson's Village of Leclaire was renowned internationally as a noteworthy and successful experiment. It was described in the New York World on numerous occasions but in particular by reporter Nellie Bly in 1894 who wrote at length about the model town where "The labor question is solved and everybody happy in a little village near St. Louis." The Los Angeles Times also regularly reported on N. O. Nelson, as did the Chicago Daily Tribune and numerous other publications.<br/><br/>In a speech at Leclaire's 15th anniversary celebration in 1915, Nelson said, "Leclaire extends to you a wide open hospitality, and bids you enjoy today the ease and comfort and beauty and inspiration which we enjoy every day." More than a century has passed since that day, but the invitation still stands. Residents and researchers are invited to learn about Leclaire's history and consider the lessons that might be learned for the betterment of future generations.<br/><br/>One of the former buildings of the manufacturing complex in 2019, which now serves as the N. O. Nelson Campus of Lewis and Clark Community College<br/>Photo by Ben Ostermeier<br/><br/>Friends of Leclaire, organized in 1990 following Leclaire's Centennial celebration, promotes the history of Leclaire through a website (historic-leclaire.org), publications, and a festival, Leclaire Parkfest, held annually on the third Sunday in October | Leclaire<br/><br/>Le quartier historique de Leclaire, autrefois appelé la «banlieue au sud» d'Edwardsville, a été fondé en tant que communauté coopérative en 1890 et est resté un village séparé jusqu'à son annexion à la ville d'Edwardsville en 1934. Des journaux et des magazines à travers les États-Unis et l'Europe ont rapporté l'expérience de Leclaire, en particulier au cours des 20 premières années de son existence. En 1979, en raison de son histoire unique, l'ancien village a été inscrit au registre national des lieux historiques.<br/><br/>Leclaire a été fondée par Nelson Oliver Nelson, un fabricant de plomberie de Saint-Louis qui, pendant de nombreuses années, a cherché à faire progresser le sort de la classe ouvrière. Nelson voulait améliorer les conditions de travail de ses employés et fournir des logements près des usines afin que les travailleurs et leurs familles puissent facilement participer aux programmes récréatifs et éducatifs offerts gratuitement par l’entreprise. Avant 1890, alors qu'elles étaient encore à St. Louis, les entreprises de fabrication et de distribution de la N. O. Nelson Company ont commencé à offrir des possibilités de partage des bénéfices ainsi que des possibilités éducatives et récréatives. L'expérience coopérative de Leclaire apporterait des avantages supplémentaires.<br/><br/>Lorsque les employés de Nelson ont indiqué qu'ils voulaient déménager dans une zone rurale, les représentants de l'entreprise ont approché les dirigeants de petites villes de plusieurs communautés du Missouri et de l'Illinois près de leur siège social de St. Louis. Ils recherchaient une propriété convenable pour construire de nouvelles usines et un village modèle. Au sud d’Edwardsville, ils ont trouvé un terrain de 125 acres avec accès à l’eau, au charbon et aux transports. Les hommes d’affaires locaux ont agi rapidement pour offrir une incitation financière. En moins de trois semaines, la communauté a recueilli un fonds de 20 000 $ provenant de contributions individuelles comprises entre 1 $ et 1 000 $ pour inciter Nelson à choisir Edwardsville pour son entreprise.<br/><br/>Les dirigeants de la ville espéraient localiser la propriété à l'intérieur des limites de la ville d'Edwardsville, mais lorsqu'aucun site approprié ne pouvait être trouvé, ils étaient confiants que l'investissement de Nelson au sud de la ville deviendrait bientôt une partie d'Edwardsville. Bien que Nelson remplisse toutes les conditions pour la construction et la création d’emplois dans son contrat, il faudra 44 ans avant l’annexion à Edwardsville. Leclaire, délimitée par les avenues Madison/Brown à l'est, les voies ferrées à l'ouest, les avenues Hadley/McKinley au sud et la rue Wolf au nord, reste un village indépendant de 1890 à 1934. Pendant ce temps, il a acquis une réputation d'innovations dans les affaires, l'éducation et la planification résidentielle.<br/><br/>Le village de Leclaire sur une carte d'Edwardsville datant de 1931<br/>Avec l'aimable autorisation de Paul Jenkins<br/><br/>À la fin des années 1880, il était un leader international dans les domaines de la coopération et du partage des bénéfices, échangeant des théories sociales avec d'autres à travers le monde tout en développant son entreprise de Saint-Louis. Il a nommé son village expérimental d’après le profit parisien, Edme Jean Leclaire, mais il a visité beaucoup d’autres visionnaires sociaux qui ont fourni des informations et de l’inspiration. Compilant les meilleures idées de ces exemples, Nelson a fondé Leclaire pour, selon ses mots, «donner du travail, promouvoir l'intelligence, fournir des loisirs, favoriser la beauté et faire des maisons». Ce sont tous des facteurs qu'il a jugés nécessaires pour que les hommes mènent une vie épanouissante. Les auteurs ultérieurs ont utilisé ces mots pour formuler les principes fondateurs de Leclaire: travail, maisons, éducation, loisirs et beauté, mais avec le principe important supplémentaire de la liberté.<br/><br/>Travail<br/><br/>Le travail pourrait être considéré comme le plus important de ces facteurs, car sans les emplois d'usine à Leclaire, il n'y aurait pas de village. Les bâtiments de l'usine de briques ont été conçus par l'architecte E. A. Cameron pour fournir de la lumière naturelle, de la ventilation en été et des planchers chauffants en hiver. Il y avait un système d'extinction des incendies et, bien que les accidents du travail n'aient pas été éliminés, tous les efforts ont été faits pour garantir la sécurité des travailleurs. En 1894, la journaliste new-yorkaise Nellie Bly a qualifié les bâtiments de « perfection idéale des bâtiments pour que l'homme puisse y travailler ».<br/><br/>Le complexe industriel de la N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company à Leclaire<br/>Les amis de Leclaire<br/><br/>Les politiques de l'entreprise Nelson étaient conçues pour protéger la stabilité financière des employés. Les travailleurs pouvaient gagner une part des bénéfices et avoir une voix dans l'entreprise s'ils choisissaient cette option. Le plan de partage des bénéfices a donné aux employés de Nelson une fierté de propriété qui a entraîné une main-d'œuvre de soutien. Il y a eu quelques grèves de courte durée au fil des ans, mais pour la plupart, les problèmes de travail étaient rares. Les travailleurs avaient également des heures raisonnables et des salaires compétitifs. Il y avait un fonds de prévoyance qui prévoyait des pensions et des congés de maladie, ainsi que des pensions de veuve si un travailleur décédait, que le décès soit lié ou non à son emploi.<br/><br/>Le siège social de la N. O. Nelson Company (NONCO) est resté à St. Louis, mais toute la N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company a été transférée à Leclaire. La société de fabrication a été divisée en magasins qui fabriquaient une variété de produits. En 1900, les magasins devinrent des sociétés indépendantes à des fins fiscales, mais tous étaient encore la propriété de la N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company. Les artisans qualifiés qui ont travaillé ici ont également rempli des contrats spéciaux, y compris des cages de guichet pour une banque locale et un autel encore en usage à l'église épiscopale St. Andrew à Edwardsville. Le Marble Shop s'est spécialisé dans le marbre architectural qui a été coupé et installé par les équipes de Nelson dans les maisons, les entreprises et même les capitales de l'État à travers le Midwest. L'atelier de mécanique, devenu Bignall et Keeler, fabriquait des machines d'essayage de tuyaux, des pompes, des jauges et divers outils mécaniques attendus dans le commerce de la plomberie. Ils se sont également diversifiés pour fabriquer des articles spécialisés comme le vélo Leclaire au milieu des années 1890. L'atelier de laiton comprenait une fonderie où divers tuyaux et outils de plomberie ont été fabriqués. Ces exemples ne représentent que quelques-uns des travaux effectués dans les usines de Leclaire. Le logo de l'entreprise était un "NONCO" stylisé qui peut encore être vu sur les appareils de plomberie et certaines bouches d'incendie à Edwardsville aujourd'hui.<br/><br/>Logements<br/><br/>Avant que les maisons puissent être construites, il fallait des logements pour les travailleurs qui achevaient les bâtiments de l'usine ainsi que des maisons de construction. Pour répondre à ces besoins, l'entreprise a construit le «Club House», un grand bâtiment qui a servi à plusieurs fins. En plus de l'hébergement, c'était le premier bâtiment éducatif de la communauté, et il contenait une bibliothèque bien garnie.<br/><br/>La construction de la partie résidentielle de Leclaire a commencé immédiatement après la fondation du village en juin 1890. Julius Pitzman, l'architecte paysagiste innovant qui a aménagé les premiers lots à Leclaire, les a mis en place avec un certain nombre de pactes de protection. Les covenants prévoyaient de larges rues curvilignes, de grands lots et une restriction de fait qui limitait les propriétés à des fins résidentielles ou éducatives seulement. L’entreprise a pavé les rues, fourni des lampadaires électriques, installé des trottoirs et planté des centaines d’arbres le long des rues de Leclaire. Les sections ultérieures de Leclaire ont été aménagées avec une conception de grille conventionnelle et des lots plus petits, mais incluaient toujours les restrictions de l'acte.<br/><br/>Un chalet victorien Leclaire en 1907<br/>par Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>À l’origine, les maisons ont été construites par l’entreprise, puis vendues à des employés de Nelson pour encourager l’accession à la propriété. Si un travailleur tombait malade et ne pouvait pas faire son hypothèque, les paiements étaient suspendus jusqu’à ce qu’il retourne au travail. Les maisons ont été offertes dans une variété de conceptions de maisons et la société a annoncé qu'il n'y avait pas deux logements identiques. Les premières maisons étaient principalement des chalets victoriens qui venaient avec l'électricité et l'eau courante. Les résidents pouvaient acheter une maison construite par l’entreprise ou acheter un terrain vide et construire eux-mêmes une maison, à condition que la conception architecturale réponde aux normes de l’entreprise.<br/><br/>Plus tard, des lots ont été vendus à des investisseurs, généralement des résidents d'Edwardsville, et de nombreuses maisons dans les années 1920 ont été construites par des entrepreneurs locaux qui les ont ensuite vendues à des résidents de la région.<br/><br/>Éducation<br/><br/>Nelson croyait en l'éducation pour tous, y compris la classe ouvrière. Les programmes éducatifs ont commencé avec un jardin d'enfants au Club House en 1892 et se sont poursuivis dans le nouveau bâtiment éducatif au 722 Holyoake Road. Communément appelé la "Maison de l'école", ce bâtiment fournissait une grande salle pour les réunions et les programmes, mais avait des cloisons mobiles pour le diviser en salle de classe pendant la journée. Le soir, il y avait des danses, des réunions ou des programmes du Leclaire Self-Culture Club qui proposaient des conférences hebdomadaires par des professeurs de l’Université de Washington ou des conférenciers de renommée nationale qui, comme N. O. Nelson, faisaient partie du mouvement d’amélioration sociale au tournant du siècle. Ceux-ci comprenaient Jane Addams, Edward Everett Hale, Samuel "Golden Rule" Jones, et l'auteur Charlotte Perkins Gilman, entre autres.<br/><br/>Enfants inscrits à la maternelle de Leclaire en 1913<br/>par Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Au cours des dix années qui ont suivi la construction du bâtiment de l'éducation en 1895, il y a eu une série d'expériences éducatives, y compris une école industrielle, un collège, une école du soir et une académie. L'entreprise la plus ancienne et la plus longue a été la maternelle du matin, fondée en 1892, qui utilisait le modèle de Fr-bel. Ce programme de deux ans était gratuit pour tout le monde, y compris les enfants d'Edwardsville, jusqu'en 1931, date à laquelle, pour des raisons financières, l'entreprise a commencé à facturer des frais de scolarité aux étudiants qui n'étaient pas les enfants des employés. Nelson Manufacturing exploita un jardin d'enfants jusqu'en 1934, lorsque le bâtiment fut cédé au district scolaire d'Edwardsville pour une somme modique.<br/><br/>Loisirs<br/><br/>Bateaux sur le lac Leclaire en 1915<br/>par Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Les loisirs étaient une caractéristique importante de Leclaire. La société fournissait des installations sportives pour le baseball, le tennis et plus tard, le football. Une salle de bowling et de billard a été construite et il y avait un lac pour la navigation de plaisance, la natation, la pêche ou le patinage sur glace en hiver. Leclaire Park a été meublé avec des hangars à bateaux, des maisons de bains mâles et femelles, et un grand pavillon. Les résidents ont organisé des danses, des hayrides, des abeilles orthographiques et d’autres activités, et la compagnie a parrainé un groupe qui jouait régulièrement lors de spectacles dans le village ou à Edwardsville. À l’instar des activités éducatives au Club House et à l’école, les installations récréatives de Leclaire étaient ouvertes à tous et étaient souvent une destination pour les visiteurs d’Edwardsville et même de St. Louis.<br/><br/>Beauté<br/><br/>Première photo du lac Leclaire<br/>par Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Le dernier des facteurs que Nelson jugeait importants pour une vie satisfaisante concernait l’environnement. Nelson connaissait l’importance d’un mode de vie sain. Il appréciait la beauté et la propreté que l’on pouvait trouver dans le pays, et encourageait tous les habitants de Leclaire à embellir leur propriété en plantant des jardins et des vergers. Nelson lui-même a donné l'exemple, de sorte qu'une serre d'entreprise a fourni des fleurs gratuites et des concours ont eu lieu pour les plus belles cours. Leclaire a été aménagé de sorte que tout le village avait un cadre de parc comme encore évident aujourd'hui.<br/><br/>Liberté<br/><br/>La boutique coopérative Leclaire<br/>par Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Nelson a énuméré cinq principes fondateurs pour Leclaire, mais les écrivains modernes en ajoutent un sixième: la liberté. Tous les programmes offerts par l'entreprise étaient disponibles pour les employés ainsi que les résidents locaux, mais aucun n'était obligatoire. Les résidents de Leclaire pouvaient travailler pour Nelson Manufacturing ou ailleurs, et les travailleurs n’avaient aucune obligation de vivre à Leclaire. La participation à des programmes récréatifs et éducatifs était également facultative. Il y avait aussi un magasin d'entreprise où les employés pouvaient faire des emplettes, mais contrairement à d'autres villes de l'entreprise, personne n'était endetté envers le magasin de l'entreprise. Le magasin Leclaire était une coopérative où les membres étaient facturés à des prix équitables sur le marché, mais recevaient ensuite des dividendes trimestriels.<br/><br/>Une ville d'entreprise différente<br/><br/>Tous ces avantages ont rendu Leclaire unique par rapport aux autres villes de l’entreprise, mais il y a eu aussi des cas individuels où l’entreprise a montré de la compassion et du soin pour les employés. L'entreprise ferma les usines et loua des trains d'excursion pour emmener les travailleurs et leurs familles à St. Louis pour une journée à l'Exposition universelle de 1904. Lorsque l'argent était serré, Nelson plaçait parfois de l'argent supplémentaire dans chaque enveloppe de paie pour faciliter la vie des travailleurs, et s'il instituait un programme avec lequel les hommes n'étaient pas d'accord, ils en parlaient et, aussi souvent que non, Nelson se renversait.<br/><br/>Né à Lillesand, en Norvège, en 1841, N. O. Nelson était un homme compliqué, un capitaliste qui croyait en la libre entreprise, mais aussi un socialiste, un adepte de la "règle d'or", et un patriote qui a servi pour l'Union dans la guerre civile. En 1900, il était multimillionnaire, mais au moment de sa mort en 1922, il avait tout donné pour le bien de la classe ouvrière.<br/><br/>Bien que Leclaire n'ait pas été la seule expérience sociale de Nelson, il est considéré comme son entreprise la plus réussie. D'autres efforts majeurs pour l'amélioration sociale comprenaient une chaîne d'épiceries coopératives à la Nouvelle-Orléans, un jardin d'enfants pour les enfants d'employés noirs dans ses usines de Bessemer, en Alabama, et une maison pour les consommateurs à Indio, en Californie.<br/><br/>Nelson's Village of Leclaire a été reconnu internationalement comme une expérience remarquable et réussie. Il a été décrit dans le monde de New York à de nombreuses reprises, mais en particulier par la journaliste Nellie Bly en 1894 qui a écrit longuement sur la ville modèle où "La question du travail est résolue et tout le monde heureux dans un petit village près de Saint-Louis." Le Los Angeles Times a également régulièrement rapporté sur N. O. Nelson, tout comme le Chicago Daily Tribune et de nombreuses autres publications.<br/><br/>Dans un discours prononcé à l'occasion du 15e anniversaire de Leclaire en 1915, Nelson a déclaré : « Leclaire vous offre une hospitalité ouverte et vous offre aujourd'hui la facilité, le confort, la beauté et l'inspiration dont nous jouissons tous les jours. » Plus d'un siècle s'est écoulé depuis, mais l'invitation demeure. Les résidents et les chercheurs sont invités à en apprendre davantage sur l'histoire de Leclaire et à réfléchir aux leçons qui pourraient être apprises pour l'amélioration des générations futures.<br/><br/>L'un des anciens bâtiments du complexe manufacturier en 2019, qui sert maintenant de campus N.

| Author Visits via Zoom or Skype<br/><br/>I'm excited to visit with your students via Zoom or Skype! Skype is a great option for schools/classes who aren't bringing in in-person authors, but who want to explore books and poetry, connect with an author, and ask one-on-one questions.<br/><br/>Cost<br/><br/>I offer 30-45-minute Zoom or Skype visits with schools for $125 per session (or $200 for two sessions happening within three hours in the morning or the afternoon; $325 for three sessions in one day; $425 for four sessions in one day). In each session, I try to get kids as actively involved as possible. No, it's not the same kind of connection as an in-person visit offers, but it can still be inspiring and motivating for kids!<br/><br/>What I Do<br/><br/>Each session for up to 50 students includes:<br/><br/>5 minutes of tech set-up<br/><br/>3 segments of 10ish-minutes each — You choose from:<br/><br/>How I became a writer<br/><br/>Writing this particular book (you choose which book I focus on)<br/><br/>Reading (I read some poems and kids help me read others)<br/><br/>Classroom presentation (your students put on a reading or performance for me—a very appreciative audience!)<br/><br/>Writing a poem together<br/><br/>Question and answer session<br/><br/>5 minutes of wrap-ups/goodbyes<br/><br/>I also chat with classes of pre-service teachers or groups of in-service teachers about poetry and writing.<br/><br/>Tips for a Great Virtual Visit<br/><br/>Tips for a Successful Virtual Visit<br/><br/>One of my goals for virtual school visits is to capture the interactivity that makes in-person visits successful and fun. But the truth is that sometimes it's tough to be virtually interactive! The timing might not sync up correctly, which makes reading together a challenge, and it's really hard for me to hear individual students unless they come up and speak directly into the microphone/computer. But after some trial and error, I've discovered some ways to have the best virtual visits possible. Here they are: 10 ways to make my visit with your students a great experience!<br/><br/>Before the Visit<br/><br/>Get kids as excited as possible about the visit. Visit my website with them. Read some of my books with them. Gather some questions students have for me. Anything you do ahead of time to make it feel like a BIG DEAL will go a long way toward student engagement.<br/><br/>Position the video camera or laptop with webcam so that I can see as much of the audience as possible. It's hard to assess student engagement when I can only see a couple of students.<br/><br/>Limit each group to 50 students. It's incredibly hard to engage large groups via video.<br/><br/>I'll move quickly from topic to topic or poem to poem. Please remind students that they'll need to listen closely to understand what's going on.<br/><br/>Occasionally, I do a little Reader's Theater with students. If I send you any scripted student parts ahead of time, print a copy for EACH session and cut into pieces, if needed.<br/><br/>During the Visit<br/><br/>When I discuss a book, if you have that printed book, please hold it up for students to see.<br/><br/>You are my proxy. I often can't call on students and hear individual replies. So, I might say, "We're going to get 3 ideas. Raise your hand if you have an idea." Then YOU take over, call on three students, and announce those answers to everyone in the room and to me.<br/><br/>Choose confident, outgoing students for scripted student parts (if I send any ahead of time). During my in-person school visits, I try to draw out some of the less confident students, but I've found that this doesn't work as well during virtual visits because I can't hear them.<br/><br/>Have students with speaking parts sit up front. When it's time, have them stand up and remind them to speak loudly.<br/><br/>In virtual visits, behavior management falls solely on you. I often can't see exactly what's going on, so do please step in as needed. If there's a big disruption, just ask me to hold on for a moment so that I don't chatter on while nobody's paying attention:>)<br/><br/>Feel free to take pictures of me on-screen and share on social media–even though pictures of me often look ridiculous because I'm making funny faces or something while I read!<br/><br/>If you have any questions at all, please just ask, either before or during the visit!<br/><br/>Scheduling a Virtual Session<br/><br/>Are you interested in scheduling a virtual visit with me? Just email me to set up a date, and we'll go from there | Visites d'auteur via Zoom ou Skype<br/><br/>Skype est une excellente option pour les écoles / classes qui ne font pas appel à des auteurs en personne, mais qui veulent explorer des livres et de la poésie, se connecter avec un auteur et poser des questions individuelles.<br/><br/>Coût<br/><br/>J'offre des visites Zoom ou Skype de 30 à 45 minutes avec les écoles pour 125 $ par session (ou 200 $ pour deux sessions se déroulant dans les trois heures du matin ou de l'après-midi; 325 $ pour trois sessions en une journée; 425 $ pour quatre sessions en une journée). Non, ce n'est pas le même genre de connexion qu'une visite en personne offre, mais cela peut toujours être inspirant et motivant pour les enfants!<br/><br/>Ce que je fais<br/><br/>Chaque session pour un maximum de 50 étudiants comprend:<br/><br/>5 minutes de tech set-up<br/><br/>3 segments de 10ish-minutes chacun - Vous choisissez parmi:<br/><br/>Comment je suis devenu écrivain<br/><br/>Écrire ce livre en particulier (vous choisissez le livre sur lequel je me concentre)<br/><br/>Lecture (J'ai lu des poèmes et les enfants m'aident à en lire d'autres)<br/><br/>Présentation en classe (vos élèves font une lecture ou une performance pour moi – un public très reconnaissant!)<br/><br/>Écrire un poème ensemble<br/><br/>Séance de questions et réponses<br/><br/>5 minutes de wrap-ups/au revoir<br/><br/>Je discute également avec des classes d'enseignants de pré-service ou des groupes d'enseignants en service sur la poésie et l'écriture.<br/><br/>Conseils pour une grande visite virtuelle<br/><br/>Conseils pour une visite virtuelle réussie<br/><br/>L'un de mes objectifs pour les visites virtuelles à l'école est de capturer l'interactivité qui rend les visites en personne réussies et amusantes. Mais la vérité est que parfois, il est difficile d'être virtuellement interactif! Le timing peut ne pas se synchroniser correctement, ce qui rend la lecture ensemble un défi, et il est vraiment difficile pour moi d'entendre les étudiants individuels à moins qu'ils ne viennent et parlent directement dans le microphone / ordinateur. Mais après quelques essais et erreurs, j'ai découvert quelques façons d'avoir les meilleures visites virtuelles possibles. Les voici: 10 façons de faire de ma visite avec vos étudiants une expérience formidable!<br/><br/>Avant la visite<br/><br/>Faites en sorte que les enfants soient aussi enthousiastes que possible à propos de la visite. Visitez mon site Web avec eux. Lisez certains de mes livres avec eux. Recueillez des questions que les étudiants ont pour moi. Tout ce que vous faites à l'avance pour vous faire sentir comme un grand accord ira un long chemin vers l'engagement des étudiants.<br/><br/>Positionnez la caméra vidéo ou l'ordinateur portable avec la webcam afin que je puisse voir le plus de public possible. Il est difficile d'évaluer l'engagement des élèves lorsque je ne peux voir que quelques élèves.<br/><br/>Limitez chaque groupe à 50 élèves. Il est incroyablement difficile d'engager de grands groupes via la vidéo.<br/><br/>Je vais passer rapidement d'un sujet à l'autre ou d'un poème à un poème. Veuillez rappeler aux élèves qu'ils devront écouter attentivement pour comprendre ce qui se passe.<br/><br/>De temps en temps, je fais un petit Reader's Theater avec les étudiants. Si je vous envoie des parties d'étudiants scénarisées à l'avance, imprimez une copie pour CHAQUE session et coupez en morceaux, si nécessaire.<br/><br/>Pendant la visite<br/><br/>Quand je discute d'un livre, si vous avez ce livre imprimé, s'il vous plaît, tenez-le pour que les étudiants le voient.<br/><br/>Vous êtes mon mandataire. Je ne peux souvent pas appeler les étudiants et entendre des réponses individuelles. Alors, je pourrais dire: "Nous allons avoir 3 idées. Levez la main si vous avez une idée." Ensuite, vous prenez le relais, faites appel à trois étudiants et annoncez ces réponses à tout le monde dans la salle et à moi.<br/><br/>Choisissez des étudiants confiants et sortants pour des parties d'étudiants scénarisées (si j'en envoie à l'avance). Lors de mes visites scolaires en personne, j'essaie d'attirer certains des élèves les moins confiants, mais j'ai constaté que cela ne fonctionne pas aussi bien lors des visites virtuelles parce que je ne peux pas les entendre.<br/><br/>Demandez aux élèves avec des parties parlantes de s'asseoir à l'avant. Quand il est temps, demandez-leur de se lever et de leur rappeler de parler fort.<br/><br/>Dans les visites virtuelles, la gestion du comportement dépend uniquement de vous. Je ne vois souvent pas exactement ce qui se passe, alors veuillez intervenir au besoin. S'il y a une grosse perturbation, demandez-moi de tenir un moment pour que je ne bavarde pas pendant que personne ne fait attention :)<br/><br/>N'hésitez pas à prendre des photos de moi à l'écran et à les partager sur les médias sociaux - même si les photos de moi ont souvent l'air ridicules parce que je fais des visages drôles ou quelque chose comme ça pendant que je lis!<br/><br/>Si vous avez des questions, n’hésitez pas à les poser avant ou pendant la visite !<br/><br/>Planifier une session virtuelle<br/><br/>Voulez-vous planifier une visite virtuelle avec moi? Envoyez-moi un email pour fixer une date, et nous irons à partir de là |

On the one hand it has prompted stigma and violence and on the other it has brought about constructive and supportive responses from various individuals and groups. A new book, Acting on HIV, edited by Prof. Dennis Francis, Dean of the Faculty of Education at the University of the Free State, looks at how drama can be used to promote vital social change as well as individual behavioural change.<br/><br/>Acting on HIV offers a systematic inquiry into drama as an approach to discuss HIV/AIDS and related attitudes and behaviours. The book is a scholarly text and includes the work of some twenty exceptionally creative authors. Contributing authors to the book include, amongst others, Proff. Hazel Barnes (University of the Witwatersrand), Rob Pattman (Stellenbosch University) and Yvonne Sliep from the University of KwaZulu-Natal.<br/><br/>"This project started in 2009 and has taken much of my time to bring together the work of exceptionally creative authors. The research that is communicated through the book is original and timely and makes a significant contribution to conversations about the role/s and significance of drama in addressing issues of HIV & AIDS," says Prof. Francis | Archives des nouvelles<br/><br/>Un nouveau livre examine les moyens de relever les défis liés au VIH<br/><br/>2011-11-29<br/><br/>Prof. Dennis Francis avec Marjorie Human qui a conçu la couverture du livre, Acting on HIV.<br/><br/>La pandémie de VIH a fait ressortir le meilleur et le pire chez les humains en termes de réponse, d'une part, elle a suscité la stigmatisation et la violence et, d'autre part, elle a suscité des réponses constructives et de soutien de la part de divers individus et groupes. Un nouveau livre, Acting on HIV, édité par le professeur Dennis Francis, doyen de la faculté d’éducation de l’Université de l’État libre, examine comment le théâtre peut être utilisé pour promouvoir un changement social vital ainsi qu’un changement de comportement individuel.<br/><br/>Acting on HIV propose une enquête systématique sur le drame en tant qu'approche pour discuter du VIH/sida et des attitudes et comportements connexes. Le livre est un texte savant et comprend les travaux d'une vingtaine d'auteurs exceptionnellement créatifs. Hazel Barnes (Université du Witwatersrand), Rob Pattman (Université de Stellenbosch) et Yvonne Sliep de l'Université du KwaZulu-Natal ont contribué au livre.<br/><br/>Ce projet a commencé en 2009 et a pris beaucoup de mon temps pour rassembler le travail d'auteurs exceptionnellement créatifs. La recherche qui est communiquée par le biais du livre est originale et opportune et apporte une contribution significative aux conversations sur le rôle et l'importance du drame dans la lutte contre le VIH et le sida », explique le professeur Francis. |

| Storyworld Spotlight<br/><br/>25 years of Tomb Raider<br/><br/>Tomb Raider is one of the most recognizable entertainment properties in the world. Since Lara Croft's first videogame appearance in Tomb Raider (1996), her exploits as an adventurous and quick-witted explorer have resonated widely with players, earning her a place in the pantheon of great pop culture characters. For that reason we will be putting The World of Lara Croft in the Storyworld Spotlight from December 22, 2021 to March 6, 2022.<br/><br/>Crafting a Croft<br/><br/>Lara Croft was created by studio Core Design, in Derby (UK), in 1996. The studio was looking for a lead character for their upcoming a 3D adventure game for PlayStation 1. A game in a 3rd person perspective where players would see the main character in full throughout every scene.<br/><br/>As the game was about 'raiding mysterious tombs deep under pyramids,' the lead character would need to look adventurous, and have the brains to survive complex raiding missions. After some deliberation, Lara Croft was born, a young, upper-class and utterly British woman, who was as enigmatic and intelligent as she was tough and self-reliant.<br/><br/>Success and controversy<br/><br/>Tomb Raider (1996) was a breakaway success for Core Design, who quickly doubled down on building Tomb Raider 2 (1997) and 3 (1998). A big part of the success was attributed to the games' leading lady, who found admirers both with male and female players. This baffled critics who just saw Lara Croft as a sexist cartoon.<br/><br/>Explore The World of Lara Croft in Storyworld<br/><br/>This exhibition explores the successful franchise in-depth. It looks at the history of the games and why its leading lady resonates with so many people. It also dives into the mystery of what makes Tomb Raider games tick, from the deep world building to the clever puzzles and traps, and from fantastic enemy and monster designs to the character design of the legendary heroine.<br/><br/>After all, mysteries are there to explore, and have been for the past 25 years.<br/><br/>Tickets<br/><br/>Buy your tickets for Storyworld online with a start date and entry time from Wednesday December 22.

| Real Estate Word of the Day: Option<br/><br/>Option: An agreement to keep open, for a set period, an offer to sell or lease real property. An option can be used, for example, to give the buyer time to resolve questions of financing, title, zoning and feasibility before committing the buyer to purchase. Options are frequently used in the land assemblage process. The option must be supported by its actual consideration, separate and independent of the purchase price of the property. Mere recital of consideration alone is not sufficient except in a lease-option in which the provisions of the lease are themselves sufficient consideration to support the option. An option merely creates a contractual right; it does not give the optionee any estate in the property. At the time the option is signed, the owner does not sell, nor does the buyer purchase, the property. Although the owner is obligated to sell if given notice by the buyer, the buyer is not obligated to purchase. An option to buy is also known as a call; an option to sell is known as a put. | Le mot du jour pour l’immobilier : Option<br/><br/>Option : Une entente visant à maintenir ouverte, pour une période déterminée, une offre de vente ou de location de biens immobiliers. Une option peut être utilisée, par exemple, pour donner à l'acheteur le temps de résoudre les questions de financement, de titre, de zonage et de faisabilité avant d'engager l'acheteur à acheter. Les options sont fréquemment utilisées dans le processus d'assemblage foncier. L'option doit être soutenue par sa contrepartie réelle, distincte et indépendante du prix d'achat de la propriété. Le simple considérant de la contrepartie ne suffit pas, sauf dans le cas d'une option de location dans laquelle les dispositions du bail constituent elles-mêmes une contrepartie suffisante pour soutenir l'option. Une option ne fait que créer un droit contractuel; elle ne donne à l'éventuel bénéficiaire aucun domaine dans la propriété. Au moment de la signature de l'option, le propriétaire ne vend pas, ni l'acheteur n'achète, la propriété. Bien que le propriétaire soit obligé de vendre s'il en est informé par l'acheteur, l'acheteur n'est pas obligé d'acheter. Une option d'achat est également connue sous le nom d'appel; une option de vente est connue sous le nom de put. |
| Benefits of Carotenoids for the Skin<br/><br/>Have you heard of carotenoids? These powerful phytochemicals are the pigmented constituents found in plants that give flowers, fruits, and leaves their yellow, orange and red colours.<br/><br/>Since the 1930s, scientists have identified about 800 carotenoids and about 40 are found in the human body, including the outermost layer of the epidermis, the dermis and subcutaneous fat. The most common carotenoids are beta-carotene, alpha-carotene, lutein, zeaxanthin, lycopene, and astaxanthin. You can read more about astaxanthin here.<br/><br/>The content of carotenoids in the skin is influenced by numerous factors, including the intake of fruits and vegetables, their bioavailability from various foods, supplementation, exposure to UV radiation, air pollution, alcohol consumption, smoking and stress.<br/><br/>How do Carotenoids Help My Skin?<br/><br/>Carotenoids are some of the best-known antioxidants for the skin and they also have important functions as anti-inflammatory agents.<br/><br/>Healthy Aging and Skin Repair<br/><br/>Antioxidants are essential for healthy skin because they help to prevent free radical damage to cells. Free radical damage causes premature aging and the onset of various types of skin cancers. Carotenoids, along with vitamin E, vitamin C, and Co enzyme Q10 are important dermal antioxidants.<br/><br/>Due to their antioxidant activity, carotenoids support and encourage collagen and elastin production in the skin. This helps to increase the skin's density, thickness, elasticity, and firmness. Collagen and elastin decrease as we age, so getting enough carotenoids in the diet and topically is critical for aging well.<br/><br/>Carotenoids can improve the signs of photoaging, skin discolouration, elasticity, hydration, texture, and can reduce transepidermal water loss.<br/><br/>Astaxanthin in particular stimulates fibroblasts to produce collagen and elastin, inhibits the activity of the enzymes that breakdown collagen and elastin, and shows anti-inflammatory and UV-filtering effects. It has been shown to reduce melanin in the skin, which results in the decrease in the appearance of freckles and melasma.<br/><br/>Anti-acne activity: the anti-inflammatory activity of carotenoids helps to dampen the inflammation and irritation associated with acne. Carotenoids also help to normalize and balance oil secretions from the sebaceous glands. They are valuable agents in skin repair and they stimulate epidermal regeneration, helping to smooth and soften skin.<br/><br/>Where Can I Find Carotenoids?<br/><br/>There are two ways to get your daily dose of carotenoids: through diet and through topical application. The combination of both is the ideal approach to well-aging skincare.<br/><br/>Carotenoids are fat-soluble, so your body needs fat to absorb them (think tomatoes and olive oil, broccoli and butter, or spinach and avocado). Common sources of carotenoids in food are avocado, egg yolks, kale, spinach, carrots, sweet potatoes, papaya, and tomatoes.<br/><br/>While we advocate getting as many of your nutrients and antioxidants as you can from food rather than supplementation; one study showed that astaxanthin combined with collagen hydrolysate significantly improved barrier integrity, reduced transepidermal water loss, and increased the expression of procollagen type I mRNA.<br/><br/>Topical application is key to healthy skin. Studies show that high concentrations of antioxidants in human skin offer the best protection for healthy skin at any age.<br/><br/>At Sarka Botanicals, we blend carotenoid-rich, whole plants such as calendula, dandelion, and extracts like astaxanthin with cold-pressed oils and functional ingredients. Calendula alone contains over 19 different types of carotenoids. This may explain why it has such a long history of use in skin care. Studies show that carotenoids blended with co-enzyme Q10 are especially effective at reducing inflammation and slowing premature skin aging due to sun exposure. | Avantages des caroténoïdes pour la peau<br/><br/>Ces puissants composés phytochimiques sont les constituants pigmentés que l’on trouve dans les plantes qui donnent des fleurs, des fruits et laissent leurs couleurs jaune, orange et rouge.<br/><br/>Depuis les années 1930, les scientifiques ont identifié environ 800 caroténoïdes et environ 40 se trouvent dans le corps humain, y compris la couche la plus externe de l'épiderme, le derme et la graisse sous-cutanée. Les caroténoïdes les plus courants sont le bêta-carotène, l'alpha-carotène, la lutéine, la zéaxanthine, le lycopène et l'astaxanthine. Vous pouvez en savoir plus sur l'astaxanthine ici.<br/><br/>La teneur en caroténoïdes de la peau est influencée par de nombreux facteurs, notamment la consommation de fruits et de légumes, leur biodisponibilité à partir de divers aliments, la supplémentation, l'exposition aux rayons UV, la pollution de l'air, la consommation d'alcool, le tabagisme et le stress.<br/><br/>Comment les caroténoïdes aident-ils ma peau?<br/><br/>Les caroténoïdes sont parmi les antioxydants les plus connus pour la peau et ils ont également des fonctions importantes comme agents anti-inflammatoires.<br/><br/>Vieillissement sain et réparation de la peau<br/><br/>Les antioxydants sont essentiels pour une peau saine, car ils aident à prévenir les dommages causés par les radicaux libres aux cellules. Les dommages causés par les radicaux libres provoquent le vieillissement prématuré et l'apparition de divers types de cancers de la peau. Les caroténoïdes, ainsi que la vitamine E, la vitamine C et l'enzyme Co Q10 sont des antioxydants dermiques importants.<br/><br/>En raison de leur activité antioxydante, les caroténoïdes soutiennent et encouragent la production de collagène et d'élastine dans la peau, ce qui contribue à augmenter la densité, l'épaisseur, l'élasticité et la fermeté de la peau. Le collagène et l’élastine diminuent avec l’âge, il est donc essentiel de consommer suffisamment de caroténoïdes dans l’alimentation et par voie topique pour bien vieillir.<br/><br/>Les caroténoïdes peuvent améliorer les signes du photovieillissement, de la décoloration de la peau, de l'élasticité, de l'hydratation, de la texture et peuvent réduire la perte d'eau transépidermique.<br/><br/>L'astaxanthine en particulier stimule les fibroblastes pour produire du collagène et de l'élastine, inhibe l'activité des enzymes qui décomposent le collagène et l'élastine et présente des effets anti-inflammatoires et filtrant les UV. Il a été démontré qu’il réduit la mélanine dans la peau, ce qui entraîne une diminution de l’apparence des taches de rousseur et du mélasma.<br/><br/>Activité anti-acnéique : l’activité anti-inflammatoire des caroténoïdes aide à amortir l’inflammation et l’irritation associées à l’acné, ainsi qu’à normaliser et équilibrer les sécrétions d’huile des glandes sébacées. Ils sont des agents précieux dans la réparation de la peau et ils stimulent la régénération épidermique, aidant à lisser et adoucir la peau.<br/><br/>Où puis-je trouver des caroténoïdes?<br/><br/>Il y a deux façons d'obtenir votre dose quotidienne de caroténoïdes: par l'alimentation et par application topique. La combinaison des deux est l'approche idéale pour bien vieillir la peau.<br/><br/>Les caroténoïdes sont liposolubles, de sorte que votre corps a besoin de graisse pour les absorber (pensez aux tomates et à l’huile d’olive, au brocoli et au beurre, ou aux épinards et à l’avocat). Les sources courantes de caroténoïdes dans les aliments sont l'avocat, les jaunes d'œufs, le chou frisé, les épinards, les carottes, les patates douces, la papaye et les tomates.<br/><br/>Alors que nous préconisons d’obtenir autant de vos nutriments et antioxydants que possible à partir de la nourriture plutôt que de la supplémentation; une étude a montré que l’astaxanthine combinée à l’hydrolysat de collagène améliorait considérablement l’intégrité de la barrière, réduisait la perte d’eau transépidermique et augmentait l’expression de l’ARNm de type procollagène I.<br/><br/>L’application topique est essentielle pour une peau saine. Des études montrent que des concentrations élevées d’antioxydants dans la peau humaine offrent la meilleure protection pour une peau saine à tout âge.<br/><br/>Chez Sarka Botanicals, nous mélangeons des plantes entières riches en caroténoïdes telles que le calendula, le pissenlit et des extraits comme l’astaxanthine avec des huiles pressées à froid et des ingrédients fonctionnels. Des études montrent que les caroténoïdes mélangés à la coenzyme Q10 sont particulièrement efficaces pour réduire l’inflammation et ralentir le vieillissement prématuré de la peau en raison de l’exposition au soleil. |
