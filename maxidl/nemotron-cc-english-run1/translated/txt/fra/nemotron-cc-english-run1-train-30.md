Undocumented migrants have nothing. They are not allowed to work. They have no right to state benefits nor to a place to live. They are unseen and potentially the most vulnerable group in the UK today.<br/><br/>Undocumented (or irregular) migrants include those trafficked into the sex trade or for domestic servitude; they include visa overstayers; those whose asylum applications have been refused and others who have been subject to failures in the immigration system. All of these may originally have come to the UK legally.<br/><br/>'Illegal immigrants' – those imagined to have entered the country in the backs of lorries – make up a small proportion of the undocumented.<br/><br/>Indeed some sources suggest that half the estimated 120,000 undocumented children in the UK were actually born here to undocumented parents. These children are disadvantaged from birth, solely by their immigration status.<br/><br/>The blog tells the stories of the undocumented. It highlights their daily struggles and vulnerabilities, but also their strength and resilience. It's not an easy read.<br/><br/>You can access the blog via our website (bottom of right hand column on Home Page).<br/><br/>The blog has won the online category of the Speaking Together media awards. The awards were a new addition this year to the Migrant and Refugee Woman of the Year Awards celebration at the Royal Festival Hall in London as part of International Women's Day. The panel of judges – including novelist and playwright Gillian Slovo, and journalist and author, Hannah Pool – was particularly looking for work that challenged myths and stereotypes.<br/><br/>The blog has also won the Blog North Awards 2013 in the Best Writing category and was also shortlisted for an Amnesty International Media Award. | Navigation des articles<br/><br/>"Life Without Papers" remporte le prix de la meilleure écriture<br/><br/>Le projet de blog, "Life Without Papers", créé par Len Grant, présente des histoires de familles et de jeunes migrants sans papiers. Les migrants sans papiers n'ont rien. Ils ne sont pas autorisés à travailler. Ils n'ont pas droit aux prestations de l'État ni à un endroit où vivre. Ils sont invisibles et potentiellement le groupe le plus vulnérable au Royaume-Uni aujourd'hui.<br/><br/>Les migrants sans papiers (ou en situation irrégulière) comprennent ceux qui sont victimes de la traite dans le commerce du sexe ou pour la servitude domestique; ils comprennent les personnes dont la demande d'asile a été refusée et d'autres qui ont été victimes d'échecs dans le système d'immigration. À l’origine, tout cela était peut-être arrivé légalement au Royaume-Uni.<br/><br/>Les « immigrants illégaux » – ceux qui sont censés être entrés dans le pays dans le dos des camions – constituent une petite proportion des sans-papiers.<br/><br/>En effet, certaines sources suggèrent que la moitié des 120 000 enfants sans papiers estimés au Royaume-Uni sont nés ici de parents sans papiers. Ces enfants sont désavantagés de naissance, uniquement par leur statut d'immigration.<br/><br/>Le blog raconte les histoires des sans-papiers. Il met en évidence leurs luttes quotidiennes et leurs vulnérabilités, mais aussi leur force et leur résilience.

| Sabbath School Lesson<br/><br/>In Galatians, Paul tackles issues such as freedom, the role of the law in salvation, our condition in Christ, and the nature of the Spirit-led life, as well as the age-old question, How can sinful humans be made right before a holy and just God?<br/><br/>Many scholars believe that Galatians may be the earliest of Paul's letters. It was written in A.D. 49, shortly after the famous Jerusalem Council (Acts 15). Therefore, the book may be the oldest Christian document known. As Acts and Galatians make clear, the early church found itself in a fierce battle over the nature of salvation, especially in the case of Gentiles. According to a group of Jewish believers, known as Judaizers, belief in Jesus alone was not good enough for Gentiles. Gentiles must also be circumcised and follow the laws of Moses (Acts 15:1).<br/><br/>This quarter's Bible study guide invites us to journey with the apostle Paul as he pleads with the Galatians to remain true to Jesus. It also gives us a chance to reflect on our own understanding of the truths that opened the way for Martin Luther's ultimate break with Rome and the restoration of the biblical gospel. | Leçon d'école sabbatique<br/><br/>Dans Galates, Paul aborde des questions telles que la liberté, le rôle de la loi dans le salut, notre condition en Christ, et la nature de la vie dirigée par l'Esprit, ainsi que la question séculaire: Comment les humains pécheurs peuvent-ils être rendus justes devant un Dieu saint et juste?<br/><br/>De nombreux érudits croient que Galates peut être la plus ancienne des lettres de Paul. Il a été écrit en AD 49, peu de temps après le célèbre Concile de Jérusalem (Actes 15). Par conséquent, le livre peut être le plus ancien document chrétien connu. Comme Actes et Galates l’indiquent clairement, l’église primitive s’est trouvée dans une bataille acharnée sur la nature du salut, en particulier dans le cas des Gentils. Selon un groupe de croyants juifs, connus sous le nom de judaïsants, la croyance en Jésus seul n’était pas assez bonne pour les Gentils.Les Gentils doivent également être circoncis et suivre les lois de Moïse (Actes 15:1).<br/><br/>Le guide d’étude biblique de ce trimestre nous invite à voyager avec l’apôtre Paul alors qu’il supplie les Galates de rester fidèles à Jésus. Cela nous donne également l'occasion de réfléchir à notre propre compréhension des vérités qui ont ouvert la voie à la rupture ultime de Martin Luther avec Rome et à la restauration de l'évangile biblique. |

Jean-Paul Friedrich Richter a dédié son roman Titan aux quatre beaux, Charlotte a grandi à Hanovre, où son père a servi comme gouverneur, au nom de son beau-frère, le roi George III du Royaume-Uni, qui a vécu à Londres. Quand Charlotte avait douze ans, sa mère est morte et elle a été élevée par sa sœur mère, Charlotte, qui a épousé son père en 1784 et ses sœurs ont été amenées par sa grand-mère, Maria Louise Albertine de Leiningen-Falkenburg-Dagsburg à Darmstadt.

Le 3 septembre 1785, à l'âge de quinze ans, Charlotte épousa le duc Frédéric, duc de Saxe-Altenbourg, le mariage n'était pas heureux, Charlotte était mentalement supérieure à Frédéric, qui a commencé à l'ignorer. Ils avaient aussi des problèmes, Saxe-Hildburghausen avait été ruiné financièrement par les politiques désastreuses des prédécesseurs de Frederick. Les receveurs n'accordèrent au duc et à la duchesse qu'une liste civile réduite, le père de Charlotte et ses deux frères séjournèrent souvent avec Charlotte à Hildburghausen. En 1787, elle s'installa définitivement à Hildburghausen et devint présidente du comité de crédit.

Truchsé répondit: Votre Altesse me pardonnera, mais tant que ce château est resté ici, Thérèse a alors saisi l'autre bras des barons, et les trois d'entre eux ont marché à travers la porte ensemble.<br/><br/>1617.<br/>Le prince Charles de Hesse-Kassel<br/>–<br/>Le prince Charles de Hesse-Kassel était un membre cadet de la maison de Hesse-Kassel et un maréchal général danois.

Il hérita des bureaux de son père vers 1020, et augmenta continuellement ses propriétés dans le nord de l'Italie, en 1069-1070, il essaya d'acquérir le Maine pour son fils Hugh, parce que sa femme, Gardende, était co-héritière des comtes précédents du Maine. Hugues a été déclaré comte, mais il ne pouvait pas l'emporter contre Robert, le duc de Normandie, dans la controverse d'investiture entre Henri IV, empereur romain germanique, et le pape Grégoire VII, Azzo a tenté de servir de médiateur, mais plus tard, il a rejoint le côté du pape.

Pape et empereur ont été réconciliés superficiellement en 1076, mais l'année les a vus à nouveau engagés dans des hostilités actives.

| Follow Us<br/><br/>ARE YOU AN<br/><br/>INSIDER<br/><br/>Craving Sugar? Here's What Your Body Is Trying to Tell You<br/><br/>by<br/>Byrdie<br/><br/>PHOTO:<br/><br/>Jacquemus<br/><br/>Weight gain from out-of-control cravings aside, it can be frustrating to have a constant hankering for something unhealthy and not know why. The good news is that there's usually a reason underlying that burning desire to house a bag of potato chips, or the feeling that you might actually die if you don't get a pickle rightthisinstant (even though you're not pregnant). If you're having visions of Milky Way bars, for example, it could mean that you're missing a very specific nutrient in your diet. (Yup—it's more complicated than said chocolate bar being so darn delicious.)<br/><br/>We talked to Los Angeles–based dietitian Shira Lenchewski, M.S., R.D., to get the skinny on some common food cravings, as well as what you can do to satiate the hunger without going overboard. Keep scrolling for some seriously good information!<br/><br/>If you're craving chocolate<br/><br/>It means: You could be lacking magnesium in your diet, says Lenchewski. "Magnesium is an essential mineral involved in energy production, glucose metabolism, and muscle function. This is especially true for those hitting the gym hard," she explains. Additionally, magnesium levels lower during the pre-menstrual weeks of your period, which explains why PMS so often comes with chocolate cravings.<br/><br/>Instead, reach for high-quality, low-sugar dark chocolate, which is naturally high in magnesium. "I recommend sticking to 75 per cent cocoa or higher, and pairing it with another magnesium-rich source like sunflower seeds," says Lenchewski. She suggests the chocolate brand Hu, a small-batch food company that focuses on high-quality ingredients produced locally. "It's a little pricey, but all the more reason to keep portions in check," she says. "It's my personal favourite." We're also big fans of superfood-packed Zenbunni.<br/><br/>If you're craving candy<br/><br/>It means: "Craving pure sugar is a good indication that you're running low on energy," says Lenchewski. "Think about it. What is the one thing you're itching for after a terrible night's sleep or at around 4 p.m. during a stressful workday? The answer is usually sugar because it's used as instant fuel for our body's cells."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for apples with nut butter. "If you're raiding your co-workers' candy stash, I recommend a more slow-burn carbohydrate with a source of fat or protein," says Lenchewski. "Unlike simple sugar, this will fuel your cells while avoiding the post-sugar crash. Two options that make for great pick-me-ups the next time you're craving candy: a sliced apple with your choice of nut butter, or berries with 2% unsweetened Greek yoghurt." We like quashing a sweet tooth with these addictive coconut chips, too—they're filling, free of any added sugar, and just so good.<br/><br/>If you're craving salt<br/><br/>It means: "If nothing but the saltiest pickle will do, you may not be drinking enough H2O," says Lenchewski. "Salt helps the body hold on to water, so we crave it when we're in need of fluids."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for water. "Stay hydrated, especially as we approach the summer months," she says. The next time a craving hits, try quenching it (literally) with a few refreshing glasses and you might find the urgency to sodium binge disappears. "If plain water bores you, try adding in mint, lemon, or frozen fruit to mix it up," says Lenchewski. And if that still doesn't do the trick, there's a healthier alternative to bagged chips or fries. "If you're really just craving salt after all, toasted seaweed is a great low-calorie option," she says.<br/><br/>If you're craving starchy carbs like pasta<br/><br/>It means: "Because high-carb foods boost the feel-good hormone serotonin, starch cravings can be a sign you're in need of a mood booster," says Lenchewski.<br/><br/>Instead, reach for a bath! "Bust out the Epsom salts, because it's time for some serious R+R," says Lenchewski. "Trust me. Indulging in a starch free-for-all feels really good in the moment, but it will likely bum you out more the next day." (As anyone who has ever over-indulged a pizza or pasta craving knows.) So the next time you want to dive head first into a bowl of carbs, draw a bath, light a candle, and treat yourself without any regret or dense calories.<br/><br/>If you're craving ice cream<br/><br/>5 / 6<br/><br/>It means: "Your body may be telling you it's in need of some healthy fat."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for coconut ice cream. "I'm a realist, so if you're craving ice cream, I'm not going to recommend a handful of walnuts, which are, of course, full of healthy fat," says Lenchewski. "For ice cream emergencies, I recommend lower-in-sugar coconut ice-creams like Coconut Bliss or Kippy's three-ingredient ice cream in Los Angeles." We can vouch for the fact that coconut ice cream tastes incredible and just like the real thing.<br/><br/>If you're craving a burger<br/><br/>It means: You need iron. "If you can't stop thinking about red meat, there's a chance your body is craving iron, b12 and folic acid," says Lenchewski. "This is especially true during or around that time of the month."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for a healthier burger. "I'm a proponent of grass fed, antibiotic and hormone-free red meat once a week," says Lenchewski. "Try experimenting with an open-faced bison burger—which, cut for cut, is leaner and has more iron than beef." Don't eat meat? Try to incorporate some kind of plant-based iron supplement into your routine, like spirulina. | Suivez-nous sur<br/><br/>Etes-vous un<br/><br/>INSIDER<br/><br/>Craving Sugar? Voici ce que votre corps essaie de vous dire<br/><br/>par<br/>Byrdie<br/><br/>PHOTO:<br/><br/>Jacquemus<br/><br/>Le gain de poids des envies incontrôlables mis à part, il peut être frustrant d’avoir un désir constant de quelque chose de malsain et de ne pas savoir pourquoi. La bonne nouvelle est qu'il y a généralement une raison sous-jacente à ce désir ardent de loger un sac de croustilles, ou le sentiment que vous pourriez réellement mourir si vous n'obtenez pas un cornichon droitethisinstant (même si vous n'êtes pas enceinte). Si vous avez des visions de barres de la Voie lactée, par exemple, cela pourrait signifier que vous manquez d'un nutriment très spécifique dans votre alimentation. (Oui, c'est plus compliqué que ladite barre de chocolat étant si délicieuse.)<br/><br/>Nous avons parlé à la diététicienne Shira Lenchewski, M.S., R.D., basée à Los Angeles, pour obtenir le maigre sur certaines fringales courantes, ainsi que ce que vous pouvez faire pour rassasier la faim sans aller trop loin. Continuez à faire défiler pour obtenir de bonnes informations!<br/><br/>Si vous avez envie de chocolat<br/><br/>Cela signifie que vous pourriez manquer de magnésium dans votre alimentation, dit Lenchewski. "Le magnésium est un minéral essentiel impliqué dans la production d'énergie, le métabolisme du glucose et la fonction musculaire. C'est particulièrement vrai pour ceux qui frappent fort au gymnase", explique-t-elle. De plus, les niveaux de magnésium diminuent pendant les semaines prémenstruelles de vos règles, ce qui explique pourquoi le syndrome prémenstruel est si souvent associé à des envies de chocolat.<br/><br/>Au lieu de cela, optez pour du chocolat noir de haute qualité et à faible teneur en sucre, qui est naturellement riche en magnésium. "Je recommande de s'en tenir à 75% de cacao ou plus, et de l'associer à une autre source riche en magnésium comme les graines de tournesol", explique Lenchewski. Elle suggère la marque de chocolat Hu, une petite entreprise alimentaire qui se concentre sur des ingrédients de haute qualité produits localement. « C'est un peu cher, mais c'est d'autant plus une raison de garder les portions sous contrôle », dit-elle. « C'est mon préféré. » Nous sommes aussi de grands fans de Zenbunni.<br/><br/>Si vous avez envie de bonbons<br/><br/>Cela signifie: "Craving sucre pur est une bonne indication que vous êtes à court d'énergie," dit Lenchewski. "Pensez-y. Quelle est la seule chose que vous démanger après une nuit de sommeil terrible ou à environ 16 heures pendant une journée de travail stressante? La réponse est généralement le sucre, car il est utilisé comme carburant instantané pour les cellules de notre corps.<br/><br/>Au lieu de cela, prenez des pommes avec du beurre de noix. « Si vous faites une descente dans la réserve de bonbons de vos collègues, je recommande un glucide à combustion plus lente avec une source de graisse ou de protéines », explique Lenchewski. Contrairement au sucre simple, cela alimentera vos cellules tout en évitant l'accident post-sucre. Deux options qui font de bons pick-me-ups la prochaine fois que vous avez envie de bonbons: une pomme tranchée avec votre choix de beurre de noix, ou des baies avec 2% de yaourt grec non sucré. Nous aimons aussi écraser une dent sucrée avec ces copeaux de noix de coco addictifs – ils sont remplis, sans sucre ajouté et tellement bons.<br/><br/>Si vous avez envie de sel<br/><br/>Cela signifie: "Si rien d'autre que le cornichon le plus salé ne suffit, vous ne buvez peut-être pas assez d'H2O", explique Lenchewski. "Le sel aide le corps à retenir l'eau, alors nous en avons envie lorsque nous avons besoin de liquides."<br/><br/>"Restez hydraté, surtout à l'approche des mois d'été," dit-elle. La prochaine fois qu'une envie frappe, essayez de l'éteindre (littéralement) avec quelques verres rafraîchissants et vous pourriez trouver l'urgence de la boulimie de sodium disparaît. "Si l'eau claire vous ennuie, essayez d'ajouter de la menthe, du citron ou des fruits congelés pour le mélanger", dit Lenchewski. Et si cela ne fait toujours pas l'affaire, il existe une alternative plus saine aux croustilles ou aux frites ensachées. "Si vous avez vraiment envie de sel après tout, les algues grillées sont une excellente option à faible teneur en calories", dit-elle.<br/><br/>Si vous avez envie de glucides féculents comme les pâtes<br/><br/>Cela signifie: "Parce que les aliments riches en glucides stimulent la sérotonine, l'hormone du bien-être, les fringales d'amidon peuvent être un signe que vous avez besoin d'un regain d'humeur", explique Lenchewski.<br/><br/>Au lieu de cela, essayez de prendre un bain! "Dégagez les sels d'Epsom, parce qu'il est temps pour un sérieux R + R", dit Lenchewski. "Faites-moi confiance. Se livrer à un amidon gratuit pour tous se sent vraiment bien dans le moment, mais cela vous fera probablement plus plaisir le lendemain." (Comme tous ceux qui ont déjà trop mangé de pizza ou de pâtes le savent.) La prochaine fois que vous voulez plonger la tête la première dans un bol de glucides, prenez un bain, allumez une bougie et offrez-vous sans regret ni calories denses.<br/><br/>Si vous avez envie de crème glacée<br/><br/>5 / 6<br/><br/>Cela signifie: "Votre corps peut vous dire qu'il a besoin d'un peu de graisse saine."<br/><br/>"Je suis réaliste, donc si vous avez envie de crème glacée, je ne vais pas vous recommander une poignée de noix de Grenoble, qui sont, bien sûr, pleines de graisses saines", dit Lenchewski. « Pour les urgences liées aux glaces, je recommande des glaces à la noix de coco à teneur plus faible en sucre comme Coconut Bliss ou la crème glacée à trois ingrédients de Kippy à Los Angeles. » Nous pouvons nous porter garants du fait que la crème glacée à la noix de coco a un goût incroyable et tout comme la vraie chose.<br/><br/>Si vous avez envie d'un burger<br/><br/>Cela signifie: vous avez besoin de fer. "Si vous ne pouvez pas arrêter de penser à la viande rouge, il y a une chance que votre corps ait envie de fer, de b12 et d'acide folique", dit Lenchewski. "Cela est particulièrement vrai pendant ou autour de cette période du mois."<br/><br/>"Je suis un partisan de la viande rouge nourrie à l'herbe, sans antibiotiques et sans hormones une fois par semaine", dit Lenchewski. "Essayez d'expérimenter avec un bison à face ouverte - qui, coupé pour couper, est plus maigre et contient plus de fer que le bœuf." Essayez d'incorporer une sorte de supplément de fer à base de plantes dans votre routine, comme la spiruline. |

| Web Services, Vendors And Cyber Laws!<br/><br/>Updated On:April 21, 2014Bilal Ahmad<br/><br/>Computerization of this world changed human performance scenario to a great extent and that too beyond measurement. For instance, Now you can send vital information all across the globe with a single mouse click, thanks to internet connectivity. Sadly, it is this wide connectivity and popularity among people, internet has also increased chances for computer crimes. Internet crimes or computer crimes are widely known as 'Cyber Crimes'.<br/><br/>'Cyber Laws' is something new in the judiciary system but has gained a lot of attention lately. The term cyber crime is something very synonymous with conventional crime, the only difference being medium of execution. There are majorly two types of cyber crimes, the first one is in which computers are the main targets and these include cases of data damage, malicious code and even criminal data access. The second one is in which computer is only a tool using which conventional crimes are committed for eg cyber terrorism, spamming, cyber stalking and many more.<br/><br/>This is where a website consultant or a vendor comes into scene. Although not aware of all the cyber laws present till date, a website vendor can advise you on some of the most vital cyber laws while creating your site.<br/><br/>This may include common knowledge of copy rights or even protecting the content of your own website. Explaining you all the rights you posses as a website owner is also one the tasks a website vendor may do while developing your website. A vendor can also assist you by offering you information on different cyber laws to protect data. Besides all of this, a vendor can also offer you information on any new cyber law that you may not be aware of till know. Cyber laws may vary from nation to nation, one recent example can be of the cookie law released in the United Kingdom, which prevents the website from saving any user browsing data. As per the Cookie Law, websites in the United Kingdom cannot save cookie files without informational consent from the surfer.<br/><br/>It is after the implementation of such law, websites now have a pop-up window, which seeks the consent of the visitor for saving cookies files. Such files are used by websites to analyze the browsing pattern of visitors based on which advertisements are then posted on a user window. With hacking not anymore a new thing for all of us, do you think such rules and regulations can prevent online forgery or cyber crime? Technology has developed at a rapid rate but still people do not prefer shopping online due to fear of personal or bank account details getting hacked. With the rise of cyber crime, need of stringent cyber laws have also increased to curb the same and to promote a risk free shopping experience.<br/><br/>Classes of Cyber Crimes<br/><br/>Over the years there have been three major classes of cyber crimes:<br/><br/>Unauthorized access of computer system cases, which involves hacking or stealing usernames and passwords to gain access over personal information of the respective user. These kind of backdoor access are organized with the help of Trojan Horse. Releasing malicious programs like Trojan House, worms or computer viruses etc. The last class includes cyber stalking a user or online harassment .<br/><br/>Direct implications of Cyber crimes<br/><br/>Decrease in sales<br/><br/>Decrease in staff output due to network delays<br/><br/>Loss of personalized information like research work<br/><br/>Disruption in communication process<br/><br/>Indirect implications of Cyber crimes<br/><br/>Credibility issue in our financial system<br/><br/>Brand image is tarnished in the market<br/><br/>Cyber crimes affect business to business relationship in the market<br/><br/>Sense of trust in state policies and government agencies is lost<br/><br/>Preventing Cyber Crime<br/><br/>As netizens there are certain precautions that we should consider for a safe and secure online experience. Here are some of them:<br/><br/>First thing to do will be to keep personal information to your self and avoid sharing the same online.<br/><br/>Avoid sharing any photographs with online chat friends or strangers.<br/><br/>Installing latest version of anti-virus on your system can offer you a good line of defense against internet threats like viruses and malware.<br/><br/>Keeping back up of your valuable data is a good option to avoid problems like virus contamination.<br/><br/>Avoid sending credit card information to sites that are unsecured and don't have any valid certificate.<br/><br/>Installing safety programme that offers you control over site cookies and saves you from being tracked by websites.<br/><br/>Putting host-based intrusions detection devices on servers will help you keep track of irregularities on your website traffic.<br/><br/>Use of firewall is advised.<br/><br/>Why Cyber attacks are so popular?<br/><br/>Cheaper than traditional cheating methods<br/><br/>Tracking cyber crimes are not easy<br/><br/>Exact locations cannot be tracked easily<br/><br/>Absence of physical barrier in the internet world<br/><br/>Cyber crimes affect large number of people<br/><br/>Conclusion<br/><br/>The fact that human mind has unfathomable power is undeniable, which is why internet crimes are increasing at a tremendous rate. Even history has witnessed some of the greatest internet security gone kaput by the hands of hackers, who have easily got away too. The only way to curb such crime is to remain aware of the cyber laws that we have today, that can either be through internet or through website/IT vendors. Information Technology Act has to be balanced in such a way that it proves too stringent for people who are involved in cyber crimes and at the same time it should never hamper the growth of Internet industry.<br/><br/>Author Bio:– Maneet Puri at present is heading a quality web design firm located at New Delhi, India.

He is also an avid writer and some of his commended work have been published on renowned websites | Services Web, fournisseurs et lois cybernétiques!<br/><br/>Mise à jour le :21 avril 2014Bilal Ahmad<br/><br/>L'informatisation de ce monde a changé le scénario de performance humaine dans une large mesure et au-delà de la mesure. Par exemple, vous pouvez maintenant envoyer des informations vitales partout dans le monde avec un seul clic de souris, grâce à la connectivité Internet. Malheureusement, c'est cette grande connectivité et la popularité parmi les gens, Internet a également augmenté les chances de crimes informatiques. Les crimes sur Internet ou les crimes informatiques sont largement connus sous le nom de «cybercrimes».<br/><br/>La cybercriminalité est quelque chose de nouveau dans le système judiciaire, mais a beaucoup attiré l'attention ces derniers temps. Le terme cybercriminalité est quelque chose de très synonyme de crime conventionnel, la seule différence étant moyen d'exécution. Il existe principalement deux types de cybercriminalité, le premier est dans lequel les ordinateurs sont les principales cibles et ceux-ci comprennent les cas de dommages de données, code malveillant et même l'accès aux données criminelles. Le second est dans lequel l'ordinateur n'est qu'un outil utilisant des crimes conventionnels commis pour, par exemple, le cyberterrorisme, le spamming, le cyberharcèlement et bien d'autres.<br/><br/>Bien que vous ne connaissiez pas toutes les lois cybernétiques en vigueur à ce jour, un fournisseur de site Web peut vous conseiller sur certaines des lois cybernétiques les plus importantes lors de la création de votre site.<br/><br/>Cela peut inclure une connaissance commune des droits de copie ou même la protection du contenu de votre propre site Web.Vous expliquer tous les droits que vous possédez en tant que propriétaire de site Web est également l'une des tâches qu'un fournisseur de site Web peut faire lors du développement de votre site Web. Un fournisseur peut également vous aider en vous fournissant des informations sur les différentes lois cybernétiques pour protéger les données. En outre, un fournisseur peut également vous fournir des informations sur toute nouvelle loi cybernétique que vous ne connaissez peut-être pas jusqu'à ce que vous le sachiez. Les lois sur la cybersécurité peuvent varier d’un pays à l’autre, un exemple récent peut être la loi sur les cookies publiée au Royaume-Uni, qui empêche le site Web d’enregistrer les données de navigation des utilisateurs. Conformément à la loi sur les cookies, les sites Web au Royaume-Uni ne peuvent pas enregistrer de fichiers de cookies sans le consentement informationnel de l'internaute.<br/><br/>C’est après la mise en œuvre d’une telle loi, que les sites Web ont maintenant une fenêtre pop-up, qui demande le consentement du visiteur pour enregistrer les fichiers de cookies. Ces fichiers sont utilisés par les sites Web pour analyser le modèle de navigation des visiteurs sur la base de laquelle les publicités sont ensuite affichées sur une fenêtre utilisateur. Avec le piratage n'est plus une chose nouvelle pour nous tous, pensez-vous que de telles règles et règlements peuvent empêcher la contrefaçon en ligne ou la cybercriminalité? La technologie s’est développée à un rythme rapide, mais les gens ne préfèrent toujours pas faire leurs achats en ligne par peur que leurs informations personnelles ou bancaires ne soient piratées. Avec la montée de la cybercriminalité, le besoin de lois strictes en matière de cybersécurité a également augmenté pour réduire la criminalité et promouvoir une expérience d’achat sans risque.<br/><br/>Catégories de cybercrimes<br/><br/>Au fil des ans, il y a eu trois grandes classes de cybercriminalité :<br/><br/>L'accès non autorisé des cas de système informatique, qui implique le piratage ou le vol des noms d'utilisateur et des mots de passe pour accéder aux informations personnelles de l'utilisateur respectif. Ces types d'accès de porte dérobée sont organisés avec l'aide de cheval de Troie. Libérer des programmes malveillants comme Trojan House, vers ou virus informatiques, etc. La dernière classe comprend la cyberharcèlement d'un utilisateur ou le harcèlement en ligne.<br/><br/>Implications directes des crimes cybernétiques<br/><br/>Baisse des ventes<br/><br/>Diminution de la production de personnel due aux retards du réseau<br/><br/>Perte d'informations personnalisées telles que les travaux de recherche<br/><br/>Perturbation du processus de communication<br/><br/>Conséquences indirectes des cybercrimes<br/><br/>La question de la crédibilité dans notre système financier<br/><br/>L’image de marque est ternie sur le marché<br/><br/>Les cybercrimes affectent les relations d’affaires sur le marché<br/><br/>Le sentiment de confiance dans les politiques de l'État et les agences gouvernementales est perdu<br/><br/>Prévention de la cybercriminalité<br/><br/>En tant qu'internautes, il y a certaines précautions que nous devrions prendre pour une expérience en ligne sûre et sécurisée. En voici quelques-unes:<br/><br/>La première chose à faire est de garder les informations personnelles pour vous-même et d’éviter de les partager en ligne.<br/><br/>Évitez de partager des photos avec des amis de chat en ligne ou des étrangers.<br/><br/>L’installation de la dernière version d’antivirus sur votre système peut vous offrir une bonne ligne de défense contre les menaces Internet comme les virus et les logiciels malveillants.<br/><br/>La sauvegarde de vos données précieuses est une bonne option pour éviter des problèmes tels que la contamination par des virus.<br/><br/>Évitez d'envoyer des informations de carte de crédit à des sites qui ne sont pas sécurisés et qui n'ont pas de certificat valide.<br/><br/>Installation d'un programme de sécurité qui vous offre le contrôle sur les cookies du site et vous évite d'être suivi par des sites Web.<br/><br/>Mettre des dispositifs de détection d'intrusions basés sur l'hôte sur les serveurs vous aidera à garder une trace des irrégularités sur le trafic de votre site Web.<br/><br/>L'utilisation d'un pare-feu est conseillée.<br/><br/>Pourquoi les cyberattaques sont-elles si populaires ?<br/><br/>Moins cher que les méthodes de triche traditionnelles<br/><br/>Le suivi des cybercrimes n’est pas facile<br/><br/>Les emplacements exacts ne peuvent pas être suivis facilement<br/><br/>Absence de barrière physique dans le monde de l’internet<br/><br/>La cybercriminalité touche un grand nombre de personnes<br/><br/>Conclusion<br/><br/>Le fait que l’esprit humain ait un pouvoir insondable est indéniable, c’est pourquoi les crimes sur Internet augmentent à un rythme énorme. Même l'histoire a été témoin de certains des plus grands kaput de sécurité Internet par les mains des pirates, qui se sont facilement échappés aussi. La seule façon de lutter contre ce type de criminalité est de rester au courant des lois cybernétiques que nous avons aujourd'hui, qui peuvent être soit par Internet, soit par le biais de fournisseurs de sites Web ou de technologies de l'information. La loi sur les technologies de l'information doit être équilibrée de telle sorte qu'elle s'avère trop stricte pour les personnes impliquées dans la cybercriminalité et, en même temps, elle ne devrait jamais entraver la croissance de l'industrie de l'Internet.<br/><br/>Maneet Puri dirige actuellement une entreprise de conception Web de qualité située à New Delhi, en Inde.
