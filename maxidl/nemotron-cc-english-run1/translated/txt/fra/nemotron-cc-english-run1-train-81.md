| Forty-nine years ago today, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act of 1965.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Nearly a century ago, the 15th Amendment to the Constitution stated, "The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of race, color or previous condition of servitude." And nearly a century before that, our nation's founding fathers set in motion the great experiment of American democracy by declaring that "all men are created equal."<br/><br/>The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was a belated acknowledgment that even in America, our foundational ideals carry little weight if not protected by the rule of law. That's why Section 2 of the 15th Amendment granted Congress the "power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation."<br/><br/>And indeed, the codified language of the Voting Rights Act was able to achieve what the Reconstruction-era Congress and Thomas Jefferson could not. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act—and the civil rights movement from which they emerged—served as the catalyst for a dramatic increase in the opportunity for black Americans to participate in the democratic process.<br/><br/>For example, only 6.7 percent of eligible black Mississippians were registered to vote as of 1962; by 1969 that figure had reached 66.5 percent. Today, Mississippi has more black elected officials than any other state.<br/><br/>The protections put in place by the Voting Rights Act were long overdue when they were passed, representative of the arduous struggle with which they were achieved. But unthinkably, these protections are now under assault, jeopardizing the progress our nation worked so hard to achieve.<br/><br/>Last year, in the case of Shelby County v. Holder, the U.S. Supreme Court gutted a key component of the Voting Rights Act that enabled prior federal review to ensure nondiscrimination before any new voting law went into effect.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Sadly, the response of Republican leaders has been to do nothing. Sen. Ted Cruz and Gov. Rick Perry went out of their way to praise the Supreme Court's decision. Sen. Rand Paul dismissed the continued necessity of the Voting Rights Act by noting, "We have an African-American president."<br/><br/>While the election of President Barack Obama was indeed a historic milestone, it is dangerous to think that it absolves us from remaining vigilant against the lingering consequences of our nation's past. The haste with which states have moved to enact voting restrictions is confirmation that the protections put in place by Section 4 are still necessary.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Republican governors have signed strict photo-identification restrictions into law as the solution to a virtually nonexistent problem of voter impersonation, disproportionately hurting women, young people, working families and the African-American community. It's disingenuous for Republicans like Paul to seek the votes of these communities when they believe "there's nothing wrong with" putting restrictions in place that make it harder for these constituencies to vote.<br/><br/>Republicans have also sought to restrict early-voting periods, including the Sunday before Election Day, when African-American churches have had great success with Souls to the Polls programs.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>These restrictions represent a callous effort by Republicans to make voting harder, based on narrow, short-term political calculations that Republicans can win elections by shrinking the size of the electorate.<br/><br/>Democrats have a very different mission when it comes to voting: to ensure that every eligible voter can register, that every registered voter can vote and that every vote is accurately counted.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>The Democratic National Committee's Voter Expansion Project reflects our belief that greater voter participation strengthens our nation and our democracy. We'll continue to use our unmatched institutional knowledge to protect voting rights against legislation and tactics that would attempt to suppress the vote. And because the best defense is a good offense, we're also working to expand the vote by deploying our technology and data resources to register new voters.<br/><br/>On this anniversary, one of the best ways we can honor those who struggled—and in some cases gave their very lives—for the legislation's passage is for Republicans in Congress to join Democrats in passing the Voting Rights Amendment Act to restore the promise of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Democrat, represents Florida's 23rd Congressional District in the United States Congress. Since 2011, she has served as chair of the Democratic National Committee.

Johnson a signé la loi sur le droit de vote de 1965.<br/><br/>Publicité<br/><br/>Il y a près d’un siècle, le 15e amendement à la Constitution déclarait : « Le droit de vote des citoyens des États-Unis ne doit pas être nié ni abrégé par les États-Unis ou par un État en raison de la race, de la couleur ou de la condition antérieure de servitude. » Et près d'un siècle avant cela, les pères fondateurs de notre nation ont mis en branle la grande expérience de la démocratie américaine en déclarant que "tous les hommes sont créés égaux".<br/><br/>Le Voting Rights Act de 1965 était une reconnaissance tardive que même en Amérique, nos idéaux fondamentaux ont peu de poids si ce n’est pas protégé par la primauté du droit. C'est pourquoi la section 2 du 15e amendement a accordé au Congrès le "pouvoir de faire appliquer cet article par une législation appropriée".<br/><br/>Et en effet, le langage codifié de la Loi sur le droit de vote a été en mesure de réaliser ce que le Congrès de l'ère de la reconstruction et Thomas Jefferson ne pouvaient pas. Le Civil Rights Act de 1964 et le Voting Rights Act – et le mouvement des droits civiques dont ils sont issus – ont servi de catalyseur pour une augmentation spectaculaire de la possibilité pour les Noirs américains de participer au processus démocratique.<br/><br/>Par exemple, seulement 6,7 pour cent des Mississippiens noirs éligibles étaient inscrits sur les listes électorales en 1962. En 1969, ce chiffre atteignait 66,5 pour cent. Aujourd'hui, le Mississippi compte plus d'élus noirs que tout autre État.<br/><br/>Les protections mises en place par la loi sur le droit de vote étaient attendues depuis longtemps lorsqu’elles ont été adoptées, représentatives de la lutte ardue avec laquelle elles ont été réalisées. Mais impensable, ces protections sont maintenant attaquées, mettant en péril les progrès que notre pays a tant travaillé pour atteindre.<br/><br/>L'année dernière, dans l'affaire Shelby County v. Holder, la Cour suprême des États-Unis a vidé un élément clé de la loi sur le droit de vote qui a permis à un examen fédéral préalable d'assurer la non-discrimination avant l'entrée en vigueur de toute nouvelle loi sur le vote.<br/><br/>Publicité<br/><br/>Malheureusement, la réponse des dirigeants républicains a été de ne rien faire. Le sénateur Ted Cruz et le gouverneur Rick Perry ont fait tout leur possible pour faire l'éloge de la décision de la Cour suprême. Le sénateur Rand Paul a rejeté la nécessité continue de la loi sur le droit de vote en notant: «Nous avons un président afro-américain».<br/><br/>Bien que l'élection du président Barack Obama ait été une étape historique, il est dangereux de penser qu'elle nous absout de rester vigilants face aux conséquences persistantes du passé de notre nation. La hâte avec laquelle les États ont décidé d'adopter des restrictions de vote est la confirmation que les protections mises en place par l'article 4 sont toujours nécessaires.<br/><br/>Publicité<br/><br/>Les gouverneurs républicains ont signé des restrictions strictes en matière de photo-identification dans la loi comme la solution à un problème pratiquement inexistant d'usurpation d'identité des électeurs, blessant de manière disproportionnée les femmes, les jeunes, les familles de travailleurs et la communauté afro-américaine. Il est malhonnête pour les républicains comme Paul de chercher les votes de ces communautés quand ils croient qu’il n’y a rien de mal à mettre en place des restrictions qui rendent plus difficile pour ces circonscriptions de voter.<br/><br/>Les républicains ont également cherché à restreindre les périodes de vote anticipé, y compris le dimanche avant le jour du scrutin, lorsque les églises afro-américaines ont eu un grand succès avec les programmes Souls to the Polls.<br/><br/>Publicité<br/><br/>Ces restrictions représentent un effort impitoyable de la part des républicains pour rendre le vote plus difficile, sur la base de calculs politiques étroits et à court terme selon lesquels les républicains peuvent gagner les élections en réduisant la taille de l’électorat.<br/><br/>Les démocrates ont une mission très différente en matière de vote: veiller à ce que chaque électeur éligible puisse s'inscrire, que chaque électeur inscrit puisse voter et que chaque vote soit compté avec précision.<br/><br/>Publicité<br/><br/>Le projet d'expansion des électeurs du Comité national démocrate reflète notre conviction qu'une plus grande participation des électeurs renforce notre nation et notre démocratie. Nous continuerons d'utiliser nos connaissances institutionnelles inégalées pour protéger les droits de vote contre la législation et les tactiques qui tenteraient de supprimer le vote. Et parce que la meilleure défense est une bonne attaque, nous travaillons également à élargir le vote en déployant notre technologie et nos ressources de données pour inscrire de nouveaux électeurs.<br/><br/>En cet anniversaire, l'une des meilleures façons d'honorer ceux qui ont lutté - et dans certains cas ont donné leur vie - pour l'adoption de la loi est que les républicains au Congrès se joignent aux démocrates pour adopter la loi modifiant la loi sur le droit de vote afin de rétablir la promesse de la loi sur le droit de vote de 1965.<br/><br/>Publicité<br/><br/>Debbie Wasserman Schultz, démocrate, représente le 23e district du Congrès de la Floride au Congrès des États-Unis.

| Q&A: Vatican safeguarding expert Fr Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>13 June 2021<br/><br/>Fr Hans Zollner SJ. Image: Australian Jesuits.<br/><br/>The President of the Centre for Child Protection at the Gregorian University in Rome, and a member of the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors, Fr Hans Zollner SJ, was in Australia in 2018 to speak to Catholic ministry leaders and survivors.<br/><br/>Michael McVeigh from Jesuit Communications sat down with him during the visit to explore how the Church is responding to the abuse crisis internationally, and what can be learned from our experiences in Australia.<br/><br/>MM: This is your third trip to Australia. You've visited quite a few other countries to see how the Church is responding to abuse around the world. Can you give us some idea of what the global picture looks like?<br/><br/>Fr Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>HZ: My understanding, after having visited about 50 countries on five or six continents, is that the Church is really starting to move over the last couple of years on the issue of doing justice to victims, of listening to them, and doing whatever can be done in terms of safeguarding.<br/><br/>I was with the Jesuit Provincials from all over Africa at the end of April, and the President of the Jesuit Assistancy of Africa and Madagascar is very much committed and dedicated to this. He has put up a thorough action plan for formation and for introducing guidelines all over the place. It's a very considerate and very deliberate effort to do whatever can be done to be proactively engaged as Jesuits in Africa — in a continent where until a few years ago all of this was a foreign language.<br/><br/>One of the challenges of trying to develop this global approach is that you're dealing with so many cultures, and so many different understandings. How do you bring this together and try to provide training and support religious communities tackling these issues?<br/><br/>This is one of the major questions we have. I think what I can do is stimulate discussion, stimulate reflection, and prepare people as much as possible so that they can do the groundwork.<br/><br/>The Centre for Child Protection at the Gregorian University does not pretend to have the response to every question. Not only because we don't know the specific contexts — we might know a few of them, but we're talking about thousands of cultures, we're talking about hundreds of languages, we're talking about very diverse legal backgrounds. It varies even sometimes within one country, such as Australia where you have states within the Commonwealth of Australia that have different laws than other states.<br/><br/>I am somebody who tries to elicit and stimulate discussion and reflection. I'm also very happy to listen to people.<br/><br/>You mentioned the need to listen and support victims in being heard. We've obviously had the Royal Commission here in Australia, but what are some of the other ways that you've seen that the voices of victims are being supported around the world?<br/><br/>In France there is one diocese that has established what they call 'The Listening Space'. There, victims can come forward and they can express themselves. The bishop is present. It's an open space in which people who have been hurt tremendously are free at least to express what they want to ask from the Church leadership etc.<br/><br/>There are other places in the USA or in other countries where victims have been invited by dioceses, by Provinces, by the leadership of the Church, to come forward. I have to say that overall I think there is a good will, and there are more people like bishops and provincials who listen to victims than we know. But there is no one model of giving victims not only the space to express themselves and be listened to, but also to engage actively in Church development.<br/><br/>In terms of setting up spaces for support for victims, what are some of the things you've seen that could really help — and that we could be considering here in Australia?<br/><br/>One of the major points that many victims bring up is, 'Can't we have, within parish settings, within schools settings, a regular conversation going on that includes survivors of abuse as regular members of a committee, a commission, a sounding board, a feedback group or something like that?' So that this voice is not only brought in on a specific occasion, or where a person feels like he or she is at a point to be able to speak out about it, but [is heard] on a regular basis — build that voice into the system.<br/><br/>That will help all of us. It will help survivors and victims because they will feel welcome and appreciated in the specific experience, and in the specific life challenges, that they went through. Secondly it will help the community at large, because we can at least make ourselves more and more sensitive to what the concerns and specific needs of survivors are — that can also talk to the needs of young people.<br/><br/>M: We have strong groups of survivors here in Australia who have been able to support each other through that process. But what you're saying is that we need some way of supporting those groups, and supporting those people, through our own institutions as well?<br/><br/>And I think we need to be creative. It will work for one school and one parish and one diocese in one way, and for others in a different way. Because the survivors with whom I am in constant contact, they have quite similar requests, and similar experiences in regard to being welcomed in the Church or not — feeling thrown out or dismissed. But they have also among themselves quite different expectations. So I have learned that you have also to be very forthcoming in accepting the differences in what this specific group, or this specific survivor, wants, requests and needs.<br/><br/>M: Survivors talk about wanting to have their stories heard and acknowledged. We've had the Royal Commission here in Australia, which provided an independent process where victims could come forward. Is there a need for something like that in terms of a truth, justice and reconciliation process for the Church internationally?<br/><br/>H: Yes, I think there is a need for that internationally. But I think first every local church needs to do its own homework. I don't see it happening very soon that some such council or commission would be established to look into this area for the whole Church. The Church has a membership of 1.3 billion people, and is present in 190 countries, with all kinds of differences in expectations concerning psychological, spiritual and financial support.<br/><br/>There is one thing that I have come across consistently in communicating with, working with and listening to victims, and that is that they want to be listened to. So if there was the feeling that victims were constantly being listened to — in Rome and elsewhere — I think that would give a great relief to many victims.<br/><br/>I think [Pope Francis'] concern, especially with regard to your question, is that the local churches do whatever they can so that victims will be listened to in that particular country. I have a list of people who want to speak to the Holy Father directly, and physically it is impossible. I was there in 2014 to translate for two German survivors who were chosen with two Irish and two English survivors when he received the six of them at home. He took the whole morning listening to them one after the other. For each one, he was there for 40 to 45 minutes. Were he to do this for every survivor he couldn't sleep anymore.<br/><br/>His example is modelling for the whole Catholic Church the way victims and survivors are received, welcomed and listened to. I think if the bishops and the provincials in this world, in all countries, followed his example, many survivors would be really appreciative of that.<br/><br/>Archbishop Diarmud Martin was recently quoted just before the World Meeting of Families, about the Pontifical Commission, saying that it's too small as it's currently set up to achieve what it needs to achieve. What's your take on that? Does the Church need to be putting more resources into how it's overseeing those issues?<br/><br/>At the moment we are 16 members from basically all continents, and the major language groups. We represent a variety of disciplines and professions, and the purpose of the commission — as the statutes that have just been promulgated state — is to provide counsel to the Holy Father.<br/><br/>A common misunderstanding about the commission is first that we deal with cases of allegations. That is not the case. We have no juridical or administrative power in regards to cases, because when it comes to allegations of abuse the tribunals and procedure are set.<br/><br/>A second misunderstanding is that we promote, directly, things on the ground. Our first and foremost goal is that we advise the Holy Father on issues.<br/><br/>So from my point of view, yes, we need to invest more. But we need to invest more on the local level, and we need to make sure that the proposals from the Pontifical Commission are forwarded to the Holy Father — which normally the President does — and then there is a follow-up process that reflects what we have given as our advice.<br/><br/>In Australia, Catholic Professional Standards Limited is overseeing the Church's response and providing guidelines and support for ensuring all the institutions in the Church are child-safe institutions. Is there a need for some kind of organisational support from Rome for those bishops and dioceses that are struggling to form these institutions and provide safeguarding in those dioceses?<br/><br/>I think ultimately the commission will develop in that line. They are now in the process of hiring experts in those areas.<br/><br/>I think the Church needs to understand that the local churches can learn from each other mutually. And my understanding has always been — and I think the Holy Father has reminded us — that the Church will not function as a centralised company. It does not work like that, effectively. Every bishop, every bishops conference, has, to some extent, its life on its own. What we need to learn more is to open channels of mutual communication.<br/><br/>There are a number of things that people blame for abuse in the Church. As a priest and a psychologist, and as someone who has met and worked with survivors, what are your thoughts on that issue?<br/><br/>I think the question of where does abuse come from is the most important one, and the Pope has addressed that in his letter to the people of God published on 20 August. He says in the first paragraph, and repeats it over and over again, that the question of sexual abuse is always linked — or almost always linked — not only to the question of abuse of power, but also to the abuse of conscience.<br/><br/>So the real fundamental question of abuse is much more complex than just [the question of] sexuality — be it heterosexual or homosexual. It's a power issue, and there we have to really work on the question of how do we understand priesthood, how to we understand bishophood, how do we understand and live out our ministries? What are the boundaries?<br/><br/>That's why I'm very happy that the Jesuit Province in Australia is establishing a Code of Conduct. Because we don't talk only about sexual abuse of minors. We talk about sexual abuse of adults, and we talk about abuse in other ways — like abuse of conscience, where you dictate to someone what you think, or you pretend to know by God, and you can tell another person, 'You need to do that', against the conscience of that person.<br/><br/>Many people think celibacy produces abuse. As I always say, celibacy as such is not cause for abusing — otherwise how do we explain that 99.9 per cent of all abusers do not live a celibate life, and how do we explain that 95 or 96 per cent of all priests do not abuse minors? But, celibacy, or a vow of chastity, that is not really integrated, that is not really lived out properly — yes, that produces a problem. Sometimes people take to drinking, sometime they take to gambling, and sometimes they take to sexual misconduct, with adults and with minors.<br/><br/>The real question about this is how do we deal with the notion of religious spiritual power with which priests and bishops are invested? How can theology help us to understand, and maybe how can sociology, psychology, or business administration help us to define the limits of power, and the necessity of keeping your boundaries | Q&R : Le père Hans Zollner SJ, spécialiste de la sauvegarde au Vatican<br/><br/>13 juin 2021<br/><br/>P. Hans Zollner SJ. Image: Jésuites australiens.<br/><br/>Le président du Centre pour la protection de l’enfance de l’Université grégorienne de Rome et membre de la Commission pontificale pour la protection des mineurs, le père Hans Zollner SJ, était en Australie en 2018 pour s’entretenir avec les dirigeants et les survivants du ministère catholique.<br/><br/>Michael McVeigh de Jesuit Communications s’est assis avec lui pendant la visite pour explorer comment l’Église réagit à la crise des abus à l’échelle internationale et ce que l’on peut apprendre de nos expériences en Australie.<br/><br/>MM: C'est votre troisième voyage en Australie. Vous avez visité plusieurs autres pays pour voir comment l'Église réagit aux abus dans le monde entier. Pouvez-vous nous donner une idée de ce à quoi ressemble la situation mondiale?<br/><br/>P. Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>HZ : Je crois comprendre, après avoir visité une cinquantaine de pays sur cinq ou six continents, que l’Église commence vraiment à bouger ces deux dernières années sur la question de rendre justice aux victimes, de les écouter et de faire tout ce qui peut être fait en termes de sauvegarde.<br/><br/>J’étais avec les Provinciaux Jésuites de toute l’Afrique à la fin du mois d’avril, et le Président de l’Assistance Jésuite d’Afrique et de Madagascar y est très engagé et dévoué. Il a mis en place un plan d'action complet pour la formation et l'introduction de lignes directrices partout. C’est un effort très réfléchi et très délibéré de faire tout ce qui peut être fait pour être engagé de manière proactive en tant que jésuites en Afrique – sur un continent où, jusqu’à il y a quelques années, tout cela était une langue étrangère.<br/><br/>L'un des défis de développer cette approche globale est que vous avez affaire à tant de cultures, et tant de compréhensions différentes. Comment rassemblez-vous cela et essayez-vous de fournir une formation et de soutenir les communautés religieuses qui s’attaquent à ces problèmes ?<br/><br/>C'est l'une des principales questions que nous nous posons. Je pense que je peux stimuler la discussion, stimuler la réflexion et préparer les gens autant que possible afin qu'ils puissent faire le travail de base.<br/><br/>Le Centre de protection de l'enfance de l'Université grégorienne ne prétend pas avoir la réponse à toutes les questions. Non seulement parce que nous ne connaissons pas les contextes spécifiques – nous en connaissons peut-être quelques-uns, mais nous parlons de milliers de cultures, nous parlons de centaines de langues, nous parlons de milieux juridiques très divers. Cela varie même parfois au sein d'un pays, comme l'Australie où vous avez des États au sein du Commonwealth d'Australie qui ont des lois différentes des autres États.<br/><br/>Je suis quelqu'un qui essaie de susciter et de stimuler la discussion et la réflexion. Je suis aussi très heureux d'écouter les gens.<br/><br/>Vous avez mentionné la nécessité d'écouter et d'aider les victimes à être entendues. Nous avons évidemment eu la Commission royale ici en Australie, mais quelles sont les autres façons dont vous avez vu que les voix des victimes sont soutenues dans le monde entier?<br/><br/>En France, il y a un diocèse qui a établi ce qu’ils appellent « l’espace de l’écoute ». Là, les victimes peuvent se manifester et s’exprimer. L’évêque est présent. C’est un espace ouvert dans lequel les gens qui ont été énormément blessés sont au moins libres d’exprimer ce qu’ils veulent demander à la direction de l’Église, etc.<br/><br/>Il y a d’autres endroits aux États-Unis ou dans d’autres pays où les victimes ont été invitées par les diocèses, par les provinces, par la direction de l’Église, à se manifester. Je dois dire que dans l’ensemble, je pense qu’il y a de la bonne volonté, et il y a plus de gens comme les évêques et les provinciaux qui écoutent les victimes que nous ne le savons. Mais il n’y a pas de modèle unique pour donner aux victimes non seulement l’espace pour s’exprimer et être écoutées, mais aussi pour s’engager activement dans le développement de l’Église.<br/><br/>En ce qui concerne la mise en place d'espaces pour le soutien aux victimes, quelles sont les choses que vous avez vues qui pourraient vraiment aider - et que nous pourrions envisager ici en Australie?<br/><br/>L’un des principaux points soulevés par de nombreuses victimes est le suivant : « Ne pouvons-nous pas avoir, dans les milieux paroissiaux, dans les milieux scolaires, une conversation régulière qui comprend des survivants d’abus en tant que membres réguliers d’un comité, d’une commission, d’un comité de sondage, d’un groupe de rétroaction ou quelque chose comme ça? » Pour que cette voix ne soit pas seulement apportée à une occasion spécifique, ou lorsqu’une personne a l’impression d’être en mesure d’en parler, mais qu’elle soit entendue régulièrement – construisez cette voix dans le système.<br/><br/>Cela nous aidera tous. Cela aidera les survivants et les victimes parce qu’ils se sentiront les bienvenus et appréciés dans l’expérience spécifique, et dans les défis spécifiques de la vie, qu’ils ont traversés. Deuxièmement, cela aidera la communauté dans son ensemble, car nous pouvons au moins nous rendre de plus en plus sensibles aux préoccupations et aux besoins spécifiques des survivants, qui peuvent également répondre aux besoins des jeunes.<br/><br/>M : Nous avons de solides groupes de survivants ici en Australie qui ont pu se soutenir mutuellement tout au long de ce processus. Mais ce que vous dites, c'est que nous avons besoin d'un moyen de soutenir ces groupes, et de soutenir ces personnes, par le biais de nos propres institutions aussi?<br/><br/>Et je pense que nous devons faire preuve de créativité. Cela fonctionnera pour une école, une paroisse et un diocèse d’une manière, et pour d’autres d’une manière différente. Parce que les survivants avec qui je suis en contact constant ont des demandes assez similaires, et des expériences similaires en ce qui concerne l’accueil dans l’Église ou non – se sentir rejetés ou rejetés. Mais ils ont aussi entre eux des attentes tout à fait différentes. J'ai donc appris que vous devez aussi être très prompts à accepter les différences dans ce que ce groupe spécifique, ou ce survivant spécifique, veut, demande et besoins.<br/><br/>M: Les survivants parlent de vouloir que leurs histoires soient entendues et reconnues. Nous avons eu la Commission royale ici en Australie, qui a fourni un processus indépendant où les victimes pouvaient se manifester. Y a-t-il un besoin d’une telle chose en termes de processus de vérité, de justice et de réconciliation pour l’Église au niveau international ?<br/><br/>H: Oui, je pense que cela est nécessaire au niveau international. Mais je pense d'abord que chaque église locale doit faire ses propres devoirs. Je ne vois pas cela arriver très bientôt qu’un tel conseil ou commission soit établi pour examiner ce domaine pour toute l’Église. L’Église compte 1,3 milliard de membres et est présente dans 190 pays, avec toutes sortes d’attentes concernant le soutien psychologique, spirituel et financier.<br/><br/>Il y a une chose que j’ai toujours rencontrée en communiquant avec les victimes, en travaillant avec elles et en les écoutant, c’est qu’elles veulent être écoutées. Donc, s'il y avait le sentiment que les victimes sont constamment écoutées - à Rome et ailleurs - je pense que cela apporterait un grand soulagement à de nombreuses victimes.<br/><br/>Je pense que la préoccupation [du pape François], en particulier en ce qui concerne votre question, est que les églises locales fassent tout ce qu'elles peuvent pour que les victimes soient écoutées dans ce pays particulier. J'ai une liste de personnes qui veulent parler directement au Saint-Père, et physiquement, c'est impossible. J’étais là en 2014 pour traduire pour deux survivants allemands qui ont été choisis avec deux survivants irlandais et deux anglais quand il a reçu les six d’entre eux à la maison. Il a pris toute la matinée à les écouter l’un après l’autre. Pour chacun, il était là pendant 40 à 45 minutes. Si il le faisait pour chaque survivant, il ne pouvait plus dormir.<br/><br/>Son exemple est de modeler pour toute l’Église catholique la façon dont les victimes et les survivants sont reçus, accueillis et écoutés. Je pense que si les évêques et les provinciaux de ce monde, de tous les pays, suivaient son exemple, de nombreux survivants en seraient vraiment reconnaissants.<br/><br/>Mgr Diarmud Martin a récemment été cité juste avant la Rencontre mondiale des familles, au sujet de la Commission pontificale, disant qu'elle est trop petite comme elle est actuellement mise en place pour accomplir ce qu'elle doit accomplir. L’Église a-t-elle besoin de consacrer plus de ressources à la façon dont elle supervise ces questions?<br/><br/>À l'heure actuelle, nous sommes 16 membres de tous les continents et des principaux groupes linguistiques. Nous représentons une variété de disciplines et de professions, et le but de la commission – comme les statuts qui viennent d’être promulgués – est de fournir des conseils au Saint-Père.<br/><br/>Un malentendu courant au sujet de la commission est d'abord que nous traitons des cas d'allégations, ce qui n'est pas le cas. Nous n'avons aucun pouvoir juridique ou administratif en ce qui concerne les affaires, car lorsqu'il s'agit d'allégations d'abus, les tribunaux et la procédure sont établis.<br/><br/>Un deuxième malentendu est que nous promouvons, directement, les choses sur le terrain. Notre objectif premier et principal est que nous conseillons le Saint-Père sur les questions.<br/><br/>Donc, de mon point de vue, oui, nous devons investir davantage. Mais nous devons investir davantage au niveau local, et nous devons nous assurer que les propositions de la Commission pontificale sont transmises au Saint-Père - ce que fait normalement le Président - et qu'il y a ensuite un processus de suivi qui reflète ce que nous avons donné comme conseil.<br/><br/>En Australie, Catholic Professional Standards Limited supervise la réponse de l'Église et fournit des directives et un soutien pour s'assurer que toutes les institutions de l'Église sont des institutions sûres pour les enfants. Y a-t-il un besoin d’une sorte de soutien organisationnel de la part de Rome pour les évêques et les diocèses qui luttent pour former ces institutions et assurer la sauvegarde dans ces diocèses ?<br/><br/>Je pense qu'en fin de compte, la commission évoluera dans ce sens, et elle est en train de recruter des experts dans ces domaines.<br/><br/>Je pense que l’Église a besoin de comprendre que les Églises locales peuvent apprendre les unes des autres. Et ma compréhension a toujours été – et je pense que le Saint-Père nous l’a rappelé – que l’Église ne fonctionnera pas comme une entreprise centralisée. Il ne fonctionne pas comme cela, efficacement. Chaque évêque, chaque conférence épiscopale, a, dans une certaine mesure, sa propre vie. Ce que nous avons besoin d'apprendre plus est d'ouvrir des canaux de communication mutuelle.<br/><br/>Il y a un certain nombre de choses que les gens blâment pour les abus dans l’Église. En tant que prêtre et psychologue, et en tant que personne qui a rencontré et travaillé avec des survivants, que pensez-vous de cette question?<br/><br/>Je pense que la question de savoir d’où viennent les abus est la plus importante, et le Pape l’a abordée dans sa lettre au peuple de Dieu publiée le 20 août. Il dit dans le premier paragraphe, et le répète encore et encore, que la question de l'abus sexuel est toujours liée - ou presque toujours liée - non seulement à la question de l'abus de pouvoir, mais aussi à l'abus de conscience.<br/><br/>Donc, la vraie question fondamentale de l’abus est beaucoup plus complexe que la sexualité – qu’elle soit hétérosexuelle ou homosexuelle. C'est une question de pouvoir, et nous devons vraiment travailler sur la question de savoir comment comprendre la prêtrise, comment comprendre l'épiscopat, comment comprendre et vivre nos ministères? Quelles sont les limites?<br/><br/>C'est pourquoi je suis très heureux que la province jésuite d'Australie établisse un code de conduite, parce que nous ne parlons pas seulement d'abus sexuels sur des mineurs. Nous parlons d'abus sexuels d'adultes, et nous parlons d'abus d'autres façons - comme l'abus de conscience, où vous dictez à quelqu'un ce que vous pensez, ou vous prétendez savoir par Dieu, et vous pouvez dire à une autre personne, "Vous devez faire cela", contre la conscience de cette personne.<br/><br/>Beaucoup de gens pensent que le célibat produit des abus. Comme je le dis toujours, le célibat en tant que tel n'est pas une cause d'abus - sinon, comment expliquer que 99,9% de tous les agresseurs ne vivent pas une vie de célibat, et comment expliquer que 95 ou 96% de tous les prêtres n'abusent pas des mineurs? Mais, le célibat, ou un vœu de chasteté, qui n’est pas vraiment intégré, qui n’est pas vraiment vécu correctement – oui, cela produit un problème. Parfois, les gens boivent, parfois ils prennent au jeu, et parfois ils prennent à l'inconduite sexuelle, avec des adultes et avec des mineurs.<br/><br/>La vraie question à ce sujet est de savoir comment nous traitons la notion de pouvoir spirituel religieux dont les prêtres et les évêques sont investis? Comment la théologie peut-elle nous aider à comprendre, et peut-être comment la sociologie, la psychologie ou l’administration des affaires peuvent-elles nous aider à définir les limites du pouvoir et la nécessité de garder nos limites ? |
| I'm not surprised by this mismatch. In fact, I'd even go so far as to say this isn't something that will ever change, nor should we get all steamed up about changing it. In 10 years, we'll still have bleeding edge, complex items in the biggest concerns list, and the things we're finally getting around to understanding will be the major parts of our spending.<br/><br/>Now, Gunnar and Andy both have excellent points, specifically about IT teams seeing IT problems and solving them with IT solutions; in fact, I'm positive their points hold merit.<br/><br/>But I think there are other ideas that trump those (I did comment on their blogs about it, and later decided I should just blog here). Those top 3 concerns are bleedingly new such that:<br/><br/>we fear new things because we don't understand them, or don't understand them because they're new.<br/><br/>they're too new for us to have solid approaches to handling them.<br/><br/>they're too new for us to know if we should be worried or not! we tend to default to paranoid/worried, which is good!<br/><br/>too new to have obvious budget items assigned to them. Can I buy a box or some software that provide "cloud security" or "social media security?"<br/><br/>they're so new the business doesn't even know how to use them or what they want out of them. Let alone how we can secure them while still meeting or at least not stomping all over business needs. If the business doesn't even know how to use them yet, I'm not sure security is in any position to guide that usage securely.<br/><br/>It also should be mentioned that these new things are being largely pushed via consumerland and into the business, with IT as a sort of, "Oh yeah," thought. Firewalls, AV, AM, Auth are all IT responses to typically IT issues. Of course there is a difference there. They're also very subjective issues, as opposed to very objective items like firewalls, known malicious bits, behaviors, signatures, ports. Business presents very complex issues that are often involving people (which we can't patch) and that often don't fit nicely into blanket rules. Even if we turned away from technical solutions and devoted our time into solving these problems, they are still not going to be neatly solved. Likewise, when push comes to shove, can you have and meet goals with firewalls? Can you show improvement? All of this flows from the rather subjective non-technical aspect of those issues. Sort of the difference between a child's report card and the feedback you get from a parent-teacher conference. If you have a child, which one would you be most inclined to disagree with or not necessarily believe? (The answer is the subjective one!)<br/><br/>It could be said this is the natural progression of security and technology: from shoring up the technical controls to moving up the stack towards behavior and people. Sure, these 3 top concerns can be said to punch through firewalls and network segments, but that's the nature of those things (social media "punching" through a firewall is far different than me punching through an SSH connection to bridge my home network; social media is akin to the *way* I use my SSH connection after the hold is already punched because it is needed; i.e. social media is the way port 80 is used.)<br/><br/>Basically, all indications point to not being surprised by this dichotomy. And I don't think this is some further indication that IT/security is doing it wrong, or isn't aligned properly with business, or has a technical dark-server-room background. I'm not saying we're doing things right or we're properly aligned, but the above isn't a good argument to support the theory of those deficiencies.<br/><br/>Now for a really big jump. I'd liken the current increase in mobile computing to be as big as the introduction of computers into the business and later the PC/internet into business. Now, I wasn't around when the former happened, nor was I in the industry when the personal computer revolution swept into business, but I would bet that is the closest comparison so far. I may even say the same for social media. These are damned new and they're big changes beyond just bringing in Macs or new software or some new business process. | En fait, j'irais même jusqu'à dire que ce n'est pas quelque chose qui changera jamais, et que nous ne devrions pas nous énerver à l'idée de le changer. Dans 10 ans, nous aurons toujours des éléments complexes dans la liste des plus grandes préoccupations, et les choses que nous allons enfin comprendre seront les principales parties de nos dépenses.<br/><br/>Maintenant, Gunnar et Andy ont tous deux d'excellents points, en particulier sur les équipes informatiques qui voient les problèmes informatiques et les résolvent avec des solutions informatiques; en fait, je suis certain que leurs points sont mérités.<br/><br/>Mais je pense qu'il y a d'autres idées qui l'emportent (j'ai fait des commentaires sur leurs blogs à ce sujet, et plus tard décidé que je devrais simplement bloguer ici).<br/><br/>Nous craignons de nouvelles choses parce que nous ne les comprenons pas, ou ne les comprenons pas parce qu’elles sont nouvelles.<br/><br/>Ils sont trop nouveaux pour que nous ayons des approches solides pour les gérer.<br/><br/>ils sont trop nouveaux pour que nous sachions si nous devrions être inquiets ou non! nous avons tendance à par défaut paranoïaque / inquiet, ce qui est bien!<br/><br/>Est-ce que je peux acheter une boîte ou un logiciel qui fournit la "sécurité de nuage" ou la "sécurité de médias sociaux?"<br/><br/>ils sont si nouveaux que l'entreprise ne sait même pas comment les utiliser ou ce qu'ils veulent d'eux. Sans parler de la façon dont nous pouvons les sécuriser tout en répondant ou du moins en ne piétinant pas tous les besoins de l'entreprise. Si l'entreprise ne sait même pas encore comment les utiliser, je ne suis pas sûr que la sécurité soit en mesure de guider cette utilisation en toute sécurité.<br/><br/>Il convient également de mentionner que ces nouvelles choses sont largement poussées par la consommation et dans l'entreprise, avec l'informatique comme une sorte de «Oh ouais», pensé. Pare-feu, AV, AM, Auth sont toutes des réponses informatiques à des problèmes informatiques typiques. Bien sûr, il y a une différence là-bas. Ce sont aussi des problèmes très subjectifs, par opposition aux éléments très objectifs comme les pare-feu, les bits malveillants connus, les comportements, les signatures, les ports. Les affaires présentent des problèmes très complexes qui impliquent souvent des personnes (que nous ne pouvons pas corriger) et qui ne correspondent souvent pas bien aux règles générales. Même si nous nous détournons des solutions techniques et consacrons notre temps à résoudre ces problèmes, ils ne seront toujours pas résolus proprement. De même, lorsque la poussée vient à pousser, pouvez-vous avoir et atteindre des objectifs avec des pare-feu? Pouvez-vous montrer une amélioration? Tout cela découle de l'aspect non technique plutôt subjectif de ces questions. En quelque sorte la différence entre le bulletin d'un enfant et les commentaires que vous obtenez d'une conférence parents-enseignants. Si vous avez un enfant, avec lequel seriez-vous le plus enclin à être en désaccord ou à ne pas nécessairement croire? (La réponse est subjective!)<br/><br/>On pourrait dire que c'est la progression naturelle de la sécurité et de la technologie: de l'étayage des contrôles techniques à la montée en charge vers le comportement et les personnes. Bien sûr, on peut dire que ces 3 principales préoccupations traversent les pare-feu et les segments de réseau, mais c’est la nature de ces choses (le «punching» des médias sociaux à travers un pare-feu est bien différent de celui d’une connexion SSH pour relier mon réseau domestique; les médias sociaux s’apparentent à la * façon * j’utilise ma connexion SSH après que la cale soit déjà perforée parce qu’elle est nécessaire; c’est le port 80).<br/><br/>Fondamentalement, toutes les indications indiquent de ne pas être surpris par cette dichotomie. Et je ne pense pas que ce soit une indication supplémentaire que l'informatique / sécurité le fait mal, ou n'est pas aligné correctement avec les affaires, ou a un arrière-plan technique sombre-serveur. Je ne dis pas que nous faisons les choses correctement ou que nous sommes correctement alignés, mais ce qui précède n'est pas un bon argument pour soutenir la théorie de ces lacunes.<br/><br/>Maintenant, pour un saut vraiment grand. Je voudrais que l'augmentation actuelle de l'informatique mobile soit aussi grande que l'introduction des ordinateurs dans l'entreprise et plus tard le PC / Internet dans les affaires. Maintenant, je n'étais pas là quand le premier est arrivé, et je n'étais pas non plus dans l'industrie quand la révolution de l'ordinateur personnel s'est lancée dans les affaires, mais je parie que c'est la comparaison la plus proche jusqu'à présent. Ils sont sacrément nouveaux et ils sont de grands changements au-delà de simplement apporter des Mac ou de nouveaux logiciels ou de nouveaux processus commerciaux. |
