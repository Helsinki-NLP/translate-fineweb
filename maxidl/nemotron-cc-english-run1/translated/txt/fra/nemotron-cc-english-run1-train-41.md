| Bacopa<br/><br/>19 Nov 2015<br/>Posted by Doxiderol<br/><br/>Bacopa is a perennial plant that thrives in marshy subtropical and tropical regions around the globe. The highly regarded herb is a key ingredient in Doxiderol, a nutritional supplement that enhances cognitive function. Bacopa was chosen for its ability to protect the brain and increase acetylcholine, a biochemical messenger that enables the nervous system to relay information.<br/><br/>Ayurvedic practitioners first described the therapeutic properties of bacopa in 300 BC. The physicians recorded bacopa's abilities to enhance intelligence and memory. Nearly 2,500 years later, a growing body of modern research confirms the cognitive benefits of bacopa recorded in the Ayurvedic text.<br/><br/>In 1987, researchers in India evaluated the effects of bacopa on the intellectual function of school-aged children. During the four-week study, they administered bacopa to 40 children who were 6 to 8 years old. The scientists determined that bacopa increased perception and memory. The children were able to solve maze exercises quicker and more accurately after receiving bacopa. Many parents in India routinely use bacopa to enhance their children's intellectual development.<br/><br/>A 12-week study published in the August 2001 issue of Psychopharmacology investigated the effects of bacopa on cognitive function. Scientists randomly assigned the healthy volunteers, aged 18 to 65, to receive bacopa or an inactive substance. They also used a double-blind configuration for the study to conceal the identities of the products. Researchers use this design to ensure that the test results are valid because it eliminates bias by the researchers and participants. The bacopa group experienced a significant improvement in the speed at which they were able to process visual information. The participants also learned faster and stored new memories more efficiently.<br/><br/>In 2007, a Texas A&M College of Medicine laboratory study revealed one of the mechanisms responsible for bacopa's ability to promote brain health. According to the scientists, bacopa uses polyphenols to prevent oxidative stress and the damage that it causes to healthy brain cells. Bacopa also reduces harmful deposits of a substance known as beta-amyloid, which is the primary component of the plaque in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease.<br/><br/>A double-blind study published in the July 2008 issue of the Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine evaluated the effect of bacopa on elderly patients. The study confirmed that bacopa increased cognitive performance while reducing stress. According to the authors, the benefits achieved in this study confirmed the results of earlier research.<br/><br/>A 90-day study published in the December 2008 issue of Phytotherapy Research confirms the cognitive benefits that were previously demonstrated in other bacopa studies. Bacopa significantly improved the ability of the participants to temporarily store and use information required for completing a complex task. The double-blind study also demonstrated that bacopa reduced the time required to process visual information.<br/><br/>In addition to enhancing nerve signal transmission, the scientists theorize that bacopa increases cognitive function by reducing anxiety. Numerous studies indicate that anxiety interferes with the ability to perform tasks that require higher-level cognitive functions, such as learning and memorization. Stress disrupts biochemical messengers and healthy nerve signal transmission. Bacopa alleviates stress and restores a sense of calm by increasing acetylcholine levels, which reduces your heart rate and enables you to take deeper breaths.<br/><br/>Doxiderol is a great way to obtain the benefits of bacopa. This holistic supplement also contains other natural ingredients that promote brain health and support your ability to focus and concentrate on complex task as well as memorize information. | Bacopa<br/><br/>19 nov. 2015<br/>Publié par Doxiderol<br/><br/>Bacopa est une plante vivace qui prospère dans les régions tropicales et subtropicales marécageuses du monde entier. L'herbe très appréciée est un ingrédient clé de Doxiderol, un supplément nutritionnel qui améliore la fonction cognitive. Bacopa a été choisi pour sa capacité à protéger le cerveau et à augmenter l'acétylcholine, un messager biochimique qui permet au système nerveux de relayer l'information.<br/><br/>Les praticiens ayurvédiques ont d'abord décrit les propriétés thérapeutiques du bacopa en 300 avant JC. Les médecins ont enregistré les capacités de bacopa pour améliorer l'intelligence et la mémoire. Près de 2500 ans plus tard, un nombre croissant de recherches modernes confirme les avantages cognitifs de la bacopa enregistrés dans le texte ayurvédique.<br/><br/>En 1987, des chercheurs indiens ont évalué les effets du bacopa sur la fonction intellectuelle des enfants d’âge scolaire et administré du bacopa à 40 enfants âgés de 6 à 8 ans. Les scientifiques ont déterminé que le bacopa augmentait la perception et la mémoire. Les enfants ont pu résoudre des exercices de labyrinthe plus rapidement et plus précisément après avoir reçu le bacopa. De nombreux parents en Inde utilisent régulièrement le bacopa pour améliorer le développement intellectuel de leurs enfants.<br/><br/>Une étude de 12 semaines publiée dans le numéro d'août 2001 de Psychopharmacology a étudié les effets de bacopa sur la fonction cognitive. Les scientifiques ont assigné au hasard les volontaires sains, âgés de 18 à 65, pour recevoir bacopa ou une substance inactive. Ils ont également utilisé une configuration en double aveugle pour l'étude afin de dissimuler l'identité des produits. Les chercheurs utilisent cette conception pour s'assurer que les résultats des tests sont valides car ils éliminent les biais des chercheurs et des participants. Le groupe bacopa a connu une amélioration significative de la vitesse à laquelle ils ont pu traiter l'information visuelle. Les participants ont également appris plus rapidement et stocké de nouveaux souvenirs plus efficacement.<br/><br/>En 2007, une étude de laboratoire du Texas A & M College of Medicine a révélé l'un des mécanismes responsables de la capacité de bacopa à promouvoir la santé du cerveau. Selon les scientifiques, le bacopa utilise des polyphénols pour prévenir le stress oxydatif et les dommages qu’il cause aux cellules saines du cerveau. Bacopa réduit également les dépôts nocifs d'une substance connue sous le nom de bêta-amyloïde, qui est le composant principal de la plaque dans le cerveau des patients atteints de la maladie d'Alzheimer.<br/><br/>Une étude en double aveugle publiée dans le numéro de juillet 2008 du Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine a évalué l'effet de bacopa sur les patients âgés. L'étude a confirmé que bacopa augmentait les performances cognitives tout en réduisant le stress. Selon les auteurs, les avantages obtenus dans cette étude ont confirmé les résultats de recherches antérieures.<br/><br/>Une étude de 90 jours publiée dans le numéro de décembre 2008 de Phytotherapy Research confirme les avantages cognitifs qui ont été précédemment démontrés dans d’autres études sur le bacopa. Bacopa a considérablement amélioré la capacité des participants à stocker et à utiliser temporairement les informations nécessaires pour accomplir une tâche complexe. L'étude en double aveugle a également démontré que bacopa réduisait le temps nécessaire au traitement des informations visuelles.<br/><br/>En plus d'améliorer la transmission du signal nerveux, les scientifiques théorisent que le bacopa augmente la fonction cognitive en réduisant l'anxiété. De nombreuses études indiquent que l’anxiété interfère avec la capacité d’effectuer des tâches qui nécessitent des fonctions cognitives de plus haut niveau, telles que l’apprentissage et la mémorisation. Bacopa soulage le stress et restaure un sentiment de calme en augmentant les niveaux d'acétylcholine, ce qui réduit votre rythme cardiaque et vous permet de prendre des respirations plus profondes.<br/><br/>Doxiderol est un excellent moyen d'obtenir les avantages de bacopa. Ce supplément holistique contient également d'autres ingrédients naturels qui favorisent la santé du cerveau et soutiennent votre capacité à vous concentrer et à vous concentrer sur une tâche complexe ainsi que mémoriser des informations. |

She can also sense demonic auras as well as evil auras. When she was born and growing, however, her powers were sealed and she was much less powerful. Since the defeat of the one sealing her powers, Kagome has reached her full potential.<br/><br/>PURIFICATION By making a physical connection, Kagome has the ability to purify both poison and darkness from a subject (living and inanimate). To do so, she projects her spiritual powers through her hand.<br/><br/>SPIRITUAL BARRIERS With her full potential, Kagome has the ability to create a barrier around herself and expand it around others. It is a dome-shaped barrier that can destroy weak demons that make contact with the barrier.<br/><br/>IMPROVED EYESIGHT<br/>Kagome has the ability to see things that are often invisible to the human eye: ghosts, spirits, divine and evil auras.<br/><br/>ABILITIES WITH WEAPONS<br/>Kagome has the ability to use a bow and arrow. She has been self trained, and after years of practice, her arrow rarely misses its mark. Alongside this, Kagome has the ability to infuse her arrows with powers. She can infuse an arrows with her spiritual powers which allows them to penetrate demonic forces, destroy spells, and purify objects. She can infuse her bow with her powers and deflect enemy attacks. She has the ability to infuse her arrows with purifying energy to purify poison as well as powerful, long distant demonic attacks. And, finally, she has the ability to bypass others with her arrow: If her target happens to be behind a barrier or a hostage, the arrow can teleport and hit only her target<br/><br/>The rest of her abilities have become rather unimportant as they are related to time travel (through the Bone Eater's Well), the Shikon Jewel, or her previous incarnation.<br/><br/>the canon<br/><br/>Kagome has been pulled a few days after her high school graduation, however, before the Bone Eater's Well has opened again to allow her to return to the past permanently.<br/><br/>freestyle<br/><br/>memories<br/><br/>かごめ<br/><br/>The sound of her name was a soft whisper in the back of her mind, like a call muffled by the wind. It was the sound of a distant memory, a voice that she had started to forget but desperately clung to all the same. It was her mother's voice, twisted in the sorrow of her lost daughter. Afterall, Kagome banished without a trace. She vividly remembered those moments, the way the day had begun, what she had for breakfast and the last thing she had said to her mother. It was haunting, those memories, because it was like any other time she had slipped between worlds. She had woken, listless, because she had no purpose outside of school. She could find a job, and was scheduled for an interview that day. Her heart hadn't been in it, but it was what she needed to do.<br/><br/>She remembered the feeling of dread, sucking it up and giving herself a pep talk that she could do this. That she could progress in the life that she was meant to now that things had been settled in the past. Of course, she had the lingering feeling that she no longer belonged in her own time or her own life. Not with everything that she had left behind.<br/><br/>Kagome remembered the feeling of the wood beneath her fingers, the way her hand had curled into the handle to slide the door open. She remembered that she paused, turning to her mother with a bright and vibrant smile as she shook herself from her stupor. "I'm taking off." She remembered how strong her voice sounded, the smile on her mother's lips as her eyes shone with pride. Her mother bade her farewell, which didn't seem any different than before but somehow the weight of the words settled in heavier on Kagome's shoulders the more she reflected.<br/><br/>Briefly, the thoughts flickered forward, wondering if her mother worried over her, missed her like she did. Kagome could openly admit that her mother's strength, her support for the fact that her daughter slipped through time so frequently. There were times when she thought herself weak for not having the woman to lean on.<br/><br/>However, she remembered that she did muster up a meager amount of strength.She could remember the shift in the air, the temperature notably different than what she had expected, blinking at the sudden and unfamiliar surroundings. It was not her family's shrine. And when she turned to go back, to slip through the door she had come through, she was met with unfamiliar and cold metal beneath her fingertips and an interior that was not the entrance of her house. A man stood before her, behind a counter, who stared at her with eyes as wide as her own.<br/><br/>She didn't panic, at least. Being torn through time and placed in impossible situations at least built your willpower as far as strange happenings went. Because it wasn't every day that someone found themselves dragged into the past by a demon, intent on ripping a powerful jewel from their body that they didn't even know was there. And then there was the fact that she had shattered said powerful jewel into who knows how many pieces and was tasked on finding them. Such things were not normal, and she had needed to square up and roll with it once she realized that was her reality. It had seemed so simple, just gather the shards and fix the jewel.<br/><br/>But it hadn't been easy, there were many demons after the shards and the jewel itself. And one particularly powerful demon with a wish that he was determined to see fulfilled. To this day, she had never learned his wish but knew it had never been granted even once he had the blasted thing completed. He had ruined so many lives for the sake of nothing. Ruined so many lives for such a futile task. Naraku had been the most difficult foe, and the one who had been the center of everything that had gone wrong in all of her friend's lives.<br/><br/>But, it was that unpredicability, that necessity to roll with what was happening and the willpower that she had gained from her adventure that she remembered drawing upon to come up with a story that fit in the moment that didn't seem too whimsical or far fetched. She needed to be believed, she needed to survive.<br/><br/>Afterall, she faced worse than a man in a camera store. She had lied through her teeth to save her life before.<br/><br/>"I was looking for a job." In the end, it wasn't a complete lie. After all, she had set out of her house with the intent of attending a job interview. Her state of dress would at least attest to that much. It was one of the easier fibs she had ever told.<br/><br/>And, for some reason, that crazy man hired her.<br/><br/>かごめ<br/><br/>Kagomed rolled over in her bed as she pushed back the distant memories, refusing to acknowledge that she was really awake. She clawed at the last glimpses of sleep, begging it to return and to take her back into its embrace. She closed her eyes, willing sleep to come and was only met with memories. The echoes of a song sang in the distance of her memories, a song that had often tormented her, given the same name as her. The voice that sang was no longer reminiscent of her mother, but the voices of children who she had often played with growing up. They called back the memories, even though it had been years since she started this live, even though she was happy in this life, the call of these memories was too loud.<br/><br/>Suddenly, she was falling back into them and sleep evaded her again. She was watching herself in her family's embrace while Inuyasha was pulled back into the well, looking as startled as she had felt. The memories of that moment, those feelings, were still so strong. The feeling of heartbreak and sorrow welled up again though it had been so long since she had felt like she had been ripped away from everything that mattered to her.<br/><br/>Of course her family mattered, and she was happy to be in their arms again. She could never fully, truly describe how she had felt in those days. She still couldn't explain the way she felt split in two, with warring desires to be in both her past and present. She remembered the futile attempts to jump through the well, fingers clawing at the ground in a desperate plea to let her return. The first month home, she didn't sleep so much as she cried.<br/><br/>Elysion had garnished a similar reaction, though it was not so fierce because she didn't know exactly where she had slipped through nor did she know where she could worm her way back. Her explorations were subtle between working her job and trying to settle herself into this life. She had no intentions of staying, no intentions of lingering longer than she needed. And while she didn't try as fiercely as she had when she tried to return to the past, her passion was tenfold because she had no ties to this world. Because she was truly alone… With no hope of anyone to reach her.<br/><br/>In her irrational moments, she thought the Jewel had pulled her back and found a new hell for her to reside in. A new hell that would force her to make a wish, but she remembered very clearly that she had wished it gone forever. That didn't stop her dreams, the times when she woke up in the night sobbing. And those memories of her past were the hardest to deal with, the hardest to forget. Her heart began to race in a panic as she turned in her bed again, her breath became a struggle as she fought against a panic attack induced by her wandering mind this late into the night.<br/><br/>She hated feeling so weak, so afraid.<br/><br/>籠の中の鳥は<br/><br/>Kagome finally pulled herself from bed, her room lit with a pale light that was enough to guide her to the bathroom. She stood before the mirror, the sink running while she stared at her reflection. Raven colored hair covered her face and she felt as bad as she looked. Her first morning in Elysion was similar to this, only she was in worse shape.<br/><br/>She had found a place to sleep, managing to work out a deal with the owner of the building to allow her to stay a small period of time without paying. Perhaps it had been Miroku's influence that allowed her to strike such deals, as the monk was known for his way in charming (or scamming) people into giving them more than enough for the work they had done. The monk had always been that way, since they had first met. He would claim the dwelling of a lord to be haunted when it was not or, claim that they were subject to an attack when they would not be. He would sell his wards and charms for such high prices. It worked practically every time and she wondered why people had been so willing to trust him.<br/><br/>Perhaps it was his smile, or the fact that he was a monk that the people of the past were so willing to crumble. He never preyed on the weak, at least. He always did what was right and he was a symbol of strength to her at times when he would push through everything in order to do what was right. He pushed through the fact that he was dying, that he was cursed, and tried to do something about it rather than wallowing in his fate. He had pushed himself to the limit in the time leading up to their final fight. And she had been glad that they had defeated Naraku before he could become subject to the same fate as his father, and his father before him.<br/><br/>As far as her own charms went, however, she was more fair than her friend and made the deal reasonable. She doubted that anyone in this world would pay a hefty price for an exorcism or banishing demons. They were too technologically advanced for that. But she was clever enough, and smart enough, to make a good deal.<br/><br/>But now, Kagome was in a better place though the look on her face looked the same. Haunted, tired, drained...<br/><br/>A quick glance at a clock on the wall told her that she could try to sleep longer. But she opted out of that, not wanting to face the flashbacks again. She took a shower instead, using the cold water to chase away her demons, to fill her lungs with a sharp intake of breath and force herself awake.<br/><br/>いついつ出やる<br/><br/>It didn't work.<br/><br/>Not in the way she was wanting. The cold water certainly forced the air into her lungs, forced her mind to wake and muscles to seize. A bitter laugh was pulled from her lips as she tilted her head back and found herself remembering more. Today, she wasn't going to escape them so easily. She wasn't going to recover so simply, to recover just because she willed it.<br/><br/>Sometimes, there's no avoiding the thoughts you wanted to. Even when you were certain that you were past them.<br/><br/>Sango would have been a great help in this situation. The demon slayer was her best friend, she would even go as far as to call her the sister that she never had. An older sister who was wise, always had her side when trouble arose. Particularly boy trouble, when such things were rather trivial but it was fun to have a crush and for her friend to be mad on her behalf when Inuyasha made her sad. After all, it had been often that the half-demon would run to his dead lover's side and break her heart more than once.<br/><br/>But, Sango also inspired her in other ways. After all the woman had faced, she had always been so strong, so sure... Even in the times that she had doubted herself, she always pulled through. She admired that she had the ability to survive after losing her whole family -- the reminder of this often pushed Kagome to survive, because she lost everyone to this world -- and then having her brother become a pawn of Naraku. It wasn't easy, couldn't have been something to that just anyone could face and still go forward with. She still smiled, even with that pain and those reminders... She was often so bright, even in the darker times.<br/><br/>And right now, she wanted to lean into the older woman's side, to take comfort in the fact that she was there and she was supportive. She felt that Sango would somehow pull through this, and offer some words of strength and understanding. It was times like these that made these spells worse, the constant reminder that she was without her family.<br/><br/>"I don't want to be alone." She cried aloud in her solitude, the sound of the shower drowning out the plea.<br/><br/>She wasn't afraid to admit it.<br/><br/>夜明けの晩に<br/><br/>Another hour had slipped by before she had realized it. Her skin was cold from the water and it felt like ice ran through her veins. She hadn't realized she had begun to shiver until her hand reached to turn off the water and end her shower. Kagome didn't seek her own gaze in the mirror again, instead, she wrapped herself in towels and trudged out of the bathroom, up the stairs and into her kitchen. She started on making a light breakfast, idly reading through her notes for the day as the food cooked.<br/><br/>Her career was really taking off these last years. Her photos were featured in many galleries, her name started to frequent many lips for those who were interested in photography.<br/><br/>The job she had asked for on a whim had sparked it all. She had been far more lucky than she had expected to be in this world. Never lucky enough to slip back through the cracks into her own world, but lucky enough to do well. As she turned back to the stove, she remembered the time she had finally given up on returning home. It was about two years into her life here, as she had started to venture into photography as more than just a hobby but something she could make a name for herself with.<br/><br/>That day had been particularly pleasant, the sun was high in the sky and she had found herself taking some photos of the natural scenery. A little boy had hidden in one of the plants, and she had caught a picture of the moment his face had settled into a cheerful, mischievous grin the moment before he had jumped out to startle his prey. It reminded her of Shippou, the little kitsune she had, essentially, adopted. He, too, had been torn from his family when they had first met. His father killed and he was determined to avenge him. While young, he did seem so mature in their first encounters.<br/><br/>Maybe it had been the influence of Inuyasha that allowed the kit to act like a kid again, to be young and whimsical at times while others he was more mature. He offered comfort to her in his own way, and she tried to care for him as she would her own though she had been so young then as well. However, her youth did not stop her from understanding how to tend to him or care for him like her child. Her heart swelled when he smiled, when he had been so happy for his gift of crayons and took the time to make art. She was so proud of each drawing that he had finished that she knew that this was how a mother would feel in such a situation.<br/><br/>The pain that had ripped through her was too much, too sudden. She missed him and wanted to see how much he had grown since she had been gone. She had missed so much...<br/><br/>To spare herself any further pain, any false hopes… She gave up. And focused on bettering herself.<br/><br/>鶴と亀が<br/><br/>Breakfast tasted bland, boring, and inspired. Only after she had finished did she realized she had forgotten to any sort of spices or flavor to the food. It was too late now to remember that much, as her mind was too busy remembering other details of her life that clearly had become more important than her food.<br/><br/>"Sit!"<br/><br/>Of course, nothing happened when she had angrily yelled at one particularly frustrating client that reminded her of the half-demon. He was being particularly stubborn and rude, wanting a photo taken his way rather than letting it work out naturally. You could try to force wild animals to behave how you wanted. But, rarely did anyone succeed with force. Inuyasha wasn't as bad, however. Inuyasha had learned before she had been forced away from him. He had become gentler, more understanding, more mature though there were times he was still childish and cocky.<br/><br/>She remember how red her cheeks had burned, but how she stood her ground and fired him. She told him she refused to work for anyone or with anyone who wanted to twist something beyond it's nature, beyond it's own desires.<br/><br/>She should have compared the man to Naraku rather than Inuyasha. Though her client did not have such extreme intentions. At least the feeling afterwards was a pleasant memory. The freedom of knowing that she had come so far that she could refuse work that she didn't want to do, to be her own person that was independent of others. She could say that she made it at that point. Even though she heard rumors days later with words meant to slander her.<br/><br/>She defended herself righteously, like she did towards the end of her journey. After all, she was the only one who could protect herself in this world.<br/><br/>滑った<br/><br/>Morning light began to creep into her home, reminding her again of the passage of time. Again, she considered the list of things she had to do and debated on where to start. Or, if she should even start at all. With how the day began, she didn't know if she could consider that a great idea. It was doubtful that she would be successful with how lost in herself she was becoming.<br/><br/>She didn't want to mess up her latest work. Because she had done that on a few occasions before. It wasn't pleasant to try and recover from a complete disaster.<br/><br/>Kagome remembered the feeling of her expensive, brand new, camera slipping from her hands. She wasn't prepared to support it, because she had just removed it from her bag. Part of her screamed on the inside. A dramatic, over-the-top, full on scream that she frequently did when she was much, much younger. When she was struggling to make it through middle school while hopping between times. The other part of her had remained frozen in place while her lense completely shattered and the rest of the camera had broken along with it.<br/><br/>Seeing Inuyasha's brother, a full demon, standing before her was the last thing she expected when she had made her way out for her photos. He stood as proud as ever, as tall as ever, as imposing as she remembered. He didn't look fazed at all to be in an entirely different world, though she was never the best at reading his mind. His name on her lips was so potent, that she could remember the tiniest feelings as she did. Her lips were chapped, her mouth felt dry, and the bubbling feeling of anxiety in her stomach made her feel sick.<br/><br/>She didn't want her hopes to be up.<br/><br/>But, she wanted him to be there, even if they were not friends. They were allies, if anything, since they had fought side by side. And something was better than absolutely nothing.<br/><br/>And Kagome had the sense enough not to throw herself at him, to wrap her arms around him in relief that knowing she was not alone. Her camera no longer mattered when she approached him. She remembered that nothing else mattered for days as she spent time with him, not speaking of their world but speaking (or, she was speaking and he simply acknowledged that fact).<br/><br/>When, exactly, she fell for him though… Kagome couldn't recall. It was a subtle thing, just like he was. But she knew the feeling was there. And he let her know that she was not alone in the fact that she had fallen, that feelings had somehow blossomed.<br/><br/>後ろの正面<br/><br/>A feeling of weightlessness overtook her and suddenly her eyes opened while her mind desperately clawed for the last thing she was doing. She didn't recall when she had fallen asleep on her couch, but she knew the last place she had been was on the far too comfortable cushions. She didn't struggle, however, or fight the weightlessness as she was in familiar arms. Her head tilted against Sesshoumaru's chest, taking comfort in the fact that he was here and she wasn't alone.<br/><br/>"Welcome back." His response was a soft hum in acknowledgement. He didn't need to speak much for her to understand his intent, or the rest of what he had to say.<br/><br/>He carried her back to her bed, settled her into it with ease. Her eyes met his and she smiled easily because no more memories drifted back, no more recollections teased at her. No, whenever he was near, she never fell back into those thoughts. He had helped, and the years had helped. Today was just… One of those days.<br/><br/>"Sleep." He commanded with ease, her eyes rolled at him but she did not fight because she was tired. Her hand clung tightly to him, while she felt his opposite hand press to her forehead in assessment of her wellbeing.<br/><br/>"I'm okay," she said, her words firm with her promise.<br/><br/>She was okay. She was alive. And she was happy.<br/><br/>だあれ<br/><br/>shipper<br/><br/>summary<br/><br/>Kagome, at one point in her life, was a rather regular teenage girl until she was attacked by a demon inside her family's well house. The demon dragged her down into the well, which magically transported her about 500 years into the past. There, she learned that a sacred jewel was encased inside her body as she was the reincarnation of a priestess that had died 50 years prior to the time she was dragged into. The jewel was ripped from her body and the demon that dragged her through time was defeated by the half-demon that she freed who was pinned to the tree. Kagome befriended the half-demon, Inuyasha, in time and traveled with him to restore the jewel that she, herself, shattered. Though it was not so straightforward and easy to do as many demons and humans sought the jewel for their own purposes. She befriended a young kitsune demon, a monk, and a demon slayer who all traveled with her to restore the jewel.<br/><br/>Her group, however, was not the one to complete the jewel. Instead, an evil half-demon who manipulated the majority of the major events in most of her companion's lives. When he finally collected all the pieces of the jewel and made his wish on the tainted object, Kagome was drawn into the jewel itself with the intent of her making a selfish wish to keep her trapped inside forever, keeping the jewel alive. It was the stubbornness of Inuyasha that managed to save her from the darkness. In the end, she returned to her natural time, finished high school as was expect from a girl of her timeline. Though days later, Kagome ended up in Elysion. She has been in this world for five years, and has long since given up on returning home. She's settled happily into her new life.<br/><br/>platonic<br/><br/>It's rather easy for Kagome to make new friends, she hasn't changed much from her youth. She is a cheerful young woman who is empathetic and welcoming to most of all in her life. In her youth, she befriended demons when most would fear them. Even demons that used to eat humans, she has befriended and she changed their ways (she'd like to think). This being said, it's really easy to become her friend as long as someone is able to shown that they are willing to be redeemed, or show that they are not completely evil. She feels greatly for everyone she meets, so it's hard for her not to be drawn to others in a desire to be friends.<br/><br/>antagonistic<br/><br/>The only way to earn Kagome's wrath is to be so deplorable, so evil, and so far beyond redemption that she can't see any good in you. And she can see the good in pretty much everyone and everything. Honestly, with whom she has faced? A half-demon that pitted two lovers against each other, that cursed the entire male line of one of her friends, and then had her best friend's brother kill their family… Yeah, I don't see her hating anyone without them really, really working for it. Feel free to give it a shot, though.<br/><br/>romantic<br/><br/>When in love, Kagome is a strong support, always staying there even when things may be rough. However, Kagome is not looking for love, wasn't looking for love when she arrived so any past relationships don't exist. This isn't to say that someone hasn't fallen in love with her. She can definitely be the subject of someone's unrequited love, she'll probably be oblivious about it, though. Finally, Kagome is currently engaged to Sesshoumaru, surprisingly. I'm totally open to potential AU things, though. <3<br/><br/>fandom hell<br/><br/>age ancient<br/><br/>species space queen<br/><br/>occupation dying<br/><br/>prefers she/her<br/><br/>awards<br/><br/>pro<br/>she/her est 62woo i suck at plot replies. but ok anyway!!! neptune is very friendly and has that 'cool' persona, he's really fun to be around, and he's SUPER good to work with. like he's super patient and he'll do anything she asks of him--he's really easy to work with, definitely in comparison to other models. so i love the idea of them being all work oriented friends at first and then turning into something more. neptune definitely tries to surround himself with people, because he loves having friends, and kagome is pretty much his type too? like she's sweet and she's a strong woman, and he is actually better friends with women than he is with men, idk why, he just loves being surrounded by female friends who knows. i love my guys being super good friends and protecting their girl friends honestly. but oh M A N i love pseduo-family type relationships and neptune is an only child, so he hasn't had any like, familial relationships like that. so her looking out for him all big sister like would make him be like ????? cause he's confused but also he actually really likes that LOL! they're both good kids, i think they'd be really fun ^^<br/><br/>fandom fire emblem: fates<br/><br/>age ninteen<br/><br/>species Part human / part dragon<br/><br/>occupation representative guardian<br/><br/>prefers she/her<br/><br/>awards<br/><br/>yonder<br/>she/her aest 20 posts<br/><br/>I haven't seen Inuyasha at all but... from what I've read Kagome seems to be one of those people who might be able to help Corrin out with her emotional state.

Frankly she hasn't worked through everything yet since she was essentially at the head of a full-scale war.

Elle peut également ressentir des auras démoniaques ainsi que des auras maléfiques. Quand elle est née et a grandi, cependant, ses pouvoirs ont été scellés et elle était beaucoup moins puissante. Depuis la défaite de celui qui scelle ses pouvoirs, Kagome a atteint son plein potentiel.<br/><br/>PURIFICATION En établissant une connexion physique, Kagome a la capacité de purifier à la fois le poison et l'obscurité d'un sujet (vivant et inanimé). Pour ce faire, elle projette ses pouvoirs spirituels à travers sa main.<br/><br/>Avec son plein potentiel, Kagome a la capacité de créer une barrière autour d'elle et de l'étendre autour des autres. C'est une barrière en forme de dôme qui peut détruire les démons faibles qui entrent en contact avec la barrière.<br/><br/>YEUX AMÉLIORÉS<br/>Kagome a la capacité de voir des choses qui sont souvent invisibles à l'œil humain: les fantômes, les esprits, les auras divines et maléfiques.<br/><br/>ABILITÉS AVEC ARMES<br/>Kagome a la capacité d'utiliser un arc et des flèches. Elle a été auto-entraînée, et après des années de pratique, sa flèche manque rarement sa marque. Parallèlement, Kagome a la capacité d'infuser ses flèches avec des pouvoirs. Elle peut insuffler des flèches avec ses pouvoirs spirituels qui leur permettent de pénétrer les forces démoniaques, de détruire les sorts et de purifier les objets. Elle peut insuffler son arc avec ses pouvoirs et dévier les attaques ennemies. Elle a la capacité d'infuser ses flèches d'énergie purificatrice pour purifier le poison ainsi que de puissantes attaques démoniaques lointaines. Et, enfin, elle a la capacité de contourner les autres avec sa flèche: Si sa cible se trouve derrière une barrière ou un otage, la flèche peut se téléporter et toucher seulement sa cible.<br/><br/>Le reste de ses capacités sont devenues assez sans importance car ils sont liés au voyage dans le temps (à travers le Bone Eater's Well), le Shikon Jewel, ou sa précédente incarnation.<br/><br/>Le canon<br/><br/>Kagome a été retirée quelques jours après l'obtention de son diplôme d'études secondaires, cependant, avant que le Bone Eater's Well ne s'ouvre à nouveau pour lui permettre de retourner dans le passé de façon permanente.<br/><br/>freestyle<br/><br/>souvenirs<br/><br/>B<br/><br/>Le son de son nom était un murmure doux dans le fond de son esprit, comme un appel étouffé par le vent. C'était le son d'un souvenir lointain, une voix qu'elle avait commencé à oublier mais s'accrochait désespérément à tout de même. C'était la voix de sa mère, tordue dans le chagrin de sa fille perdue. Après tout, Kagome a banni sans laisser de trace. Elle se souvenait vivement de ces moments, de la façon dont la journée avait commencé, de ce qu'elle avait pris au petit déjeuner et de la dernière chose qu'elle avait dite à sa mère. C'était obsédant, ces souvenirs, parce que c'était comme n'importe quel autre moment où elle avait glissé entre les mondes. Elle s'était réveillée, apathique, parce qu'elle n'avait aucun but en dehors de l'école. Elle pouvait trouver un emploi, et était prévue pour une entrevue ce jour-là. Son cœur n'était pas dedans, mais c'était ce qu'elle devait faire.<br/><br/>Elle se souvint du sentiment d’effroi qu’elle éprouvait en s’aspirant et en se faisant entendre qu’elle pouvait le faire, qu’elle pouvait progresser dans la vie qu’elle était censée mener maintenant que les choses avaient été réglées dans le passé. Bien sûr, elle avait le sentiment persistant qu'elle n'appartenait plus à son propre temps ou à sa propre vie. Pas avec tout ce qu'elle avait laissé derrière elle.<br/><br/>Kagome se souvint de la sensation du bois sous ses doigts, de la façon dont sa main s’était enroulée dans la poignée pour ouvrir la porte. Elle se souvint qu’elle s’arrêta, se tournant vers sa mère avec un sourire vif et vibrant alors qu’elle se secouait de sa stupeur. Elle se rappelait à quel point sa voix était forte, le sourire sur les lèvres de sa mère alors que ses yeux brillaient de fierté. Sa mère lui dit adieu, ce qui ne semblait pas différent d'avant, mais d'une manière ou d'une autre, le poids des mots s'installait plus lourd sur les épaules de Kagome, plus elle réfléchissait.<br/><br/>Brièvement, les pensées se sont tournées vers l'avant, se demandant si sa mère s'inquiétait pour elle, elle lui manquait comme elle l'a fait. Kagome pouvait ouvertement admettre que la force de sa mère, son soutien pour le fait que sa fille glissait à travers le temps si souvent. Il y avait des moments où elle se croyait faible pour ne pas avoir la femme sur laquelle s'appuyer.<br/><br/>Cependant, elle se souvenait qu'elle avait rassemblé une maigre quantité de force. Elle pouvait se rappeler le changement dans l'air, la température considérablement différente de ce qu'elle avait prévu, clignant des yeux à l'environnement soudain et inconnu. Ce n'était pas le sanctuaire de sa famille, et quand elle s'est retournée pour rentrer, pour passer par la porte qu'elle avait franchie, elle a rencontré du métal froid et inconnu sous ses doigts et un intérieur qui n'était pas l'entrée de sa maison. Un homme se tenait devant elle, derrière un comptoir, qui la regardait avec des yeux aussi larges que les siens.<br/><br/>Elle n'a pas paniqué, au moins, étant déchiré à travers le temps et placé dans des situations impossibles au moins construit votre volonté dans la mesure où les événements étranges sont allés. Parce que ce n'est pas tous les jours que quelqu'un s'est retrouvé traîné dans le passé par un démon, avec l'intention d'arracher un bijou puissant de leur corps dont ils ne savaient même pas qu'il était là. Et puis il y avait le fait qu'elle avait brisé ce bijou puissant dans qui sait combien de pièces et a été chargé de les trouver. De telles choses n'étaient pas normales, et elle avait besoin de s'arranger et de rouler avec elle une fois qu'elle s'est rendu compte que c'était sa réalité. Cela semblait si simple, il suffisait de rassembler les éclats et de réparer le bijou.<br/><br/>Mais cela n'avait pas été facile, il y avait beaucoup de démons après les éclats et le bijou lui-même. Et un démon particulièrement puissant avec un souhait qu'il était déterminé à voir réalisé. Jusqu’à ce jour, elle n’avait jamais appris son souhait, mais elle savait qu’il n’avait jamais été exaucé, même une fois qu’il avait terminé la chose. Il avait ruiné tant de vies pour rien. Naraku avait été l'ennemi le plus difficile, et celui qui avait été au centre de tout ce qui avait mal tourné dans la vie de son amie.<br/><br/>Mais, c'était cette imprévisibilité, cette nécessité de rouler avec ce qui se passait et la volonté qu'elle avait acquise de son aventure qu'elle se souvenait de s'appuyer sur pour venir avec une histoire qui correspondait au moment qui ne semblait pas trop fantaisiste ou loin aller chercher. Elle avait besoin d'être crue, elle avait besoin de survivre.<br/><br/>Après tout, elle faisait face à pire qu'un homme dans un magasin de caméras. Elle avait menti à travers ses dents pour sauver sa vie avant.<br/><br/>"Je cherchais un emploi." En fin de compte, ce n'était pas un mensonge complet. Après tout, elle était partie de chez elle avec l'intention d'assister à un entretien d'embauche. Son état vestimentaire en attesterait au moins autant. C'était l'un des fibs les plus faciles qu'elle ait jamais raconté.<br/><br/>Et, pour une raison quelconque, ce fou l'a embauchée.<br/><br/>B<br/><br/>Kagomed se retourna dans son lit en repoussant les souvenirs lointains, refusant de reconnaître qu'elle était vraiment éveillée. Elle griffa aux derniers aperçus du sommeil, le suppliant de revenir et de la reprendre dans son étreinte. Elle fermait les yeux, voulant bien dormir pour venir et ne rencontrait que des souvenirs. Les échos d’une chanson chantaient au loin ses souvenirs, une chanson qui l’avait souvent tourmentée, portant le même nom qu’elle. La voix qui chantait ne rappelait plus sa mère, mais les voix des enfants avec lesquels elle avait souvent joué en grandissant. Ils ont rappelé les souvenirs, même si cela faisait des années qu'elle avait commencé ce live, même si elle était heureuse dans cette vie, l'appel de ces souvenirs était trop fort.<br/><br/>Soudainement, elle retombait sur eux et dormait à nouveau. Elle se regardait dans l'étreinte de sa famille tandis qu'Inuyasha était ramenée dans le puits, l'air aussi effrayée qu'elle l'avait senti. Les souvenirs de ce moment, ces sentiments, étaient encore si forts. Le sentiment de chagrin et de tristesse remontait bien que cela faisait si longtemps qu’elle n’avait pas eu l’impression d’avoir été arrachée à tout ce qui comptait pour elle.<br/><br/>Bien sûr, sa famille comptait, et elle était heureuse d’être à nouveau dans leurs bras. Elle ne pourrait jamais décrire pleinement, vraiment ce qu’elle avait ressenti à cette époque. Elle ne pouvait toujours pas expliquer comment elle se sentait divisée en deux, avec des désirs belliqueux d'être à la fois dans son passé et dans son présent. Elle se souvenait des tentatives futiles de sauter à travers le puits, les doigts griffant le sol dans un plaidoyer désespéré pour la laisser revenir. Le premier mois à la maison, elle ne dormait pas autant qu'elle pleurait.<br/><br/>Elysion avait préparé une réaction similaire, bien que ce ne fût pas si féroce parce qu'elle ne savait pas exactement où elle avait glissé et qu'elle ne savait pas non plus où elle pourrait retourner. Ses explorations étaient subtiles entre travailler son travail et essayer de s'installer dans cette vie. Elle n'avait aucune intention de rester, aucune intention de s'attarder plus longtemps qu'elle n'en avait besoin. Et bien qu'elle n'ait pas essayé aussi farouchement qu'elle l'avait fait quand elle a essayé de revenir dans le passé, sa passion était décuplée parce qu'elle n'avait aucun lien avec ce monde. Parce qu'elle était vraiment seule... Sans espoir que personne ne l'atteigne.<br/><br/>Dans ses moments irrationnels, elle pensait que le Joyau lui avait tiré le dos et avait trouvé un nouvel enfer pour qu'elle y réside. Un nouvel enfer qui la forcerait à faire un vœu, mais elle se souvenait très clairement qu'elle avait souhaité qu'il disparaisse pour toujours. Cela n'a pas arrêté ses rêves, les moments où elle s'est réveillée dans les sanglots de la nuit. Et ces souvenirs de son passé étaient les plus difficiles à gérer, les plus difficiles à oublier. Son cœur a commencé à courir dans la panique alors qu'elle se retournait dans son lit, son souffle est devenu un combat alors qu'elle luttait contre une attaque de panique induite par son esprit errant jusque tard dans la nuit.<br/><br/>Elle détestait se sentir si faible, si effrayée.<br/><br/>B<br/><br/>Kagome s’est finalement retirée du lit, sa chambre éclairée d’une lumière pâle suffisante pour la guider jusqu’à la salle de bain. Elle se tenait devant le miroir, l’évier coulant pendant qu’elle regardait son reflet. Les cheveux de couleur corbeau couvraient son visage et elle se sentait aussi mal qu'elle en avait l'air. Son premier matin à Elysion était similaire à celui-ci, mais elle était dans un état pire.<br/><br/>Elle avait trouvé un endroit pour dormir, réussissant à conclure un accord avec le propriétaire de l'immeuble pour lui permettre de rester un peu de temps sans payer. Peut-être que c'était l'influence de Miroku qui lui avait permis de conclure de tels accords, car le moine était connu pour sa façon de charmer (ou d'arnaquer) les gens en leur donnant plus qu'assez pour le travail qu'ils avaient fait. Le moine avait toujours été ainsi, depuis qu’ils s’étaient rencontrés pour la première fois. Il prétendait que la demeure d’un seigneur était hantée quand elle ne l’était pas ou qu’ils faisaient l’objet d’une attaque quand ils ne le seraient pas. Il vendait ses pupilles et ses charmes à des prix aussi élevés. Cela fonctionnait pratiquement à chaque fois et elle se demandait pourquoi les gens avaient été si disposés à lui faire confiance.<br/><br/>Peut-être était-ce son sourire, ou le fait qu’il était un moine que les gens du passé étaient si disposés à s’effondrer. Il faisait toujours ce qui était juste et il était un symbole de force pour elle à des moments où il poussait à travers tout afin de faire ce qui était juste. Il a poussé à travers le fait qu'il était en train de mourir, qu'il était maudit, et a essayé de faire quelque chose à ce sujet plutôt que de se vautrer dans son destin. Il s'était poussé à la limite dans le temps précédant leur combat final. Et elle avait été heureuse qu'ils aient vaincu Naraku avant qu'il puisse être soumis au même sort que son père, et son père avant lui.<br/><br/>En ce qui concerne ses propres charmes, cependant, elle était plus juste que son amie et a fait l'affaire raisonnable. Elle doutait que n'importe qui dans ce monde paierait un prix élevé pour un exorcisme ou bannir les démons. Ils étaient trop avancés technologiquement pour cela. Mais elle était assez intelligente, et assez intelligente pour faire une bonne affaire.<br/><br/>Mais maintenant, Kagome était dans un meilleur endroit même si le regard sur son visage semblait le même. Hanté, fatigué, épuisé...<br/><br/>Un rapide coup d'œil à une horloge sur le mur lui a dit qu'elle pouvait essayer de dormir plus longtemps. Mais elle a choisi de ne pas faire face aux flashbacks à nouveau. Elle a pris une douche à la place, en utilisant l'eau froide pour chasser ses démons, pour remplir ses poumons avec une forte prise de souffle et se forcer à se réveiller.<br/><br/>B<br/><br/>Ca n'a pas marché.<br/><br/>Pas comme elle le voulait. L'eau froide a certainement forcé l'air dans ses poumons, a forcé son esprit à se réveiller et les muscles à se saisir. Un rire amer a été tiré de ses lèvres alors qu'elle inclinait la tête en arrière et se retrouvait à se souvenir de plus. Aujourd'hui, elle n'allait pas leur échapper si facilement, elle n'allait pas récupérer si simplement, pour récupérer juste parce qu'elle le voulait.<br/><br/>Parfois, il n'y a pas moyen d'éviter les pensées que vous vouliez, même quand vous étiez certain de les avoir dépassées.<br/><br/>Sango aurait été d'une grande aide dans cette situation. La tueuse de démons était sa meilleure amie, elle irait même jusqu'à l'appeler la sœur qu'elle n'avait jamais eue. Une sœur aînée qui était sage, avait toujours son côté quand des problèmes se posaient. En particulier les problèmes de garçon, quand de telles choses étaient plutôt triviales, mais c'était amusant d'avoir un béguin et pour son ami d'être en colère en son nom quand Inuyasha l'a rendue triste. Après tout, c’était souvent que le demi-démon courait du côté de son amant mort et lui brisait le cœur plus d’une fois.<br/><br/>Mais, Sango l’inspirait aussi d’autres façons. Après tout ce que la femme avait affronté, elle avait toujours été si forte, si sûre... Même à l’époque où elle avait douté d’elle-même, elle s’en tirait toujours. Elle admirait qu'elle avait la capacité de survivre après avoir perdu toute sa famille - le rappel de ceci a souvent poussé Kagome à survivre, parce qu'elle a perdu tout le monde dans ce monde - et ensuite avoir son frère devenu un pion de Naraku. Ce n'était pas facile, ça n'aurait pas pu être quelque chose que n'importe qui pouvait affronter et continuer. Elle souriait toujours, même avec cette douleur et ces rappels... Elle était souvent si brillante, même dans les moments les plus sombres.<br/><br/>Et en ce moment, elle voulait se pencher sur le côté de la femme plus âgée, pour se réconforter dans le fait qu'elle était là et qu'elle soutenait. Elle sentait que Sango passerait à travers cela, et offrirait quelques mots de force et de compréhension. C'était des moments comme ceux-ci qui ont aggravé ces sorts, le rappel constant qu'elle était sans sa famille.<br/><br/>"Je ne veux pas être seule." s'écria-t-elle dans sa solitude, le bruit de la douche noyant la supplique.<br/><br/>Elle n'avait pas peur de l'admettre.<br/><br/>B<br/><br/>Une autre heure s'était écoulée avant qu'elle ne s'en rende compte. Sa peau était froide de l'eau et elle avait l'impression que de la glace coulait dans ses veines. Elle n'avait pas réalisé qu'elle avait commencé à trembler jusqu'à ce que sa main atteigne pour éteindre l'eau et mettre fin à sa douche. Kagome n'a pas cherché son propre regard dans le miroir, au lieu de cela, elle s'est enveloppée dans des serviettes et a marché hors de la salle de bain, dans les escaliers et dans sa cuisine. Elle a commencé à faire un petit déjeuner léger, en lisant ses notes pour la journée comme la nourriture cuisinait.<br/><br/>Sa carrière a vraiment décollé ces dernières années. Ses photos ont été présentées dans de nombreuses galeries, son nom a commencé à fréquenter de nombreuses lèvres pour ceux qui s'intéressaient à la photographie.<br/><br/>Le travail qu'elle avait demandé sur un coup de tête avait tout déclenché. Elle avait été beaucoup plus chanceuse qu'elle ne s'y attendait dans ce monde. Jamais assez chanceuse pour se glisser à travers les fissures de son propre monde, mais assez chanceuse pour bien faire. Alors qu'elle se retournait vers le poêle, elle se souvenait du moment où elle avait finalement renoncé à rentrer chez elle. C'était environ deux ans dans sa vie ici, comme elle avait commencé à s'aventurer dans la photographie comme plus qu'un simple passe-temps, mais quelque chose qu'elle pourrait se faire un nom avec.<br/><br/>Ce jour-là avait été particulièrement agréable, le soleil était haut dans le ciel et elle s’était retrouvée à prendre des photos du paysage naturel. Un petit garçon s'était caché dans l'une des plantes, et elle avait pris une photo du moment où son visage s'était installé dans un sourire joyeux et espiègle, le moment avant qu'il n'ait sauté pour effrayer sa proie. Cela lui rappelait Shippou, le petit kitsune qu’elle avait essentiellement adopté. Lui aussi avait été arraché à sa famille lors de leur première rencontre. Son père a tué et il était déterminé à le venger. Alors qu'il était jeune, il semblait si mature lors de leurs premières rencontres.<br/><br/>Peut-être que c'était l'influence d'Inuyasha qui avait permis au kit d'agir comme un enfant à nouveau, d'être jeune et lunatique parfois tandis que d'autres il était plus mature. Il lui offrit du réconfort à sa manière, et elle essaya de prendre soin de lui comme elle le ferait elle-même, bien qu’elle eût été si jeune à l’époque, mais sa jeunesse ne l’empêcha pas de comprendre comment s’occuper de lui ou de prendre soin de lui comme son enfant. Son cœur s’enflait quand il souriait, quand il avait été si heureux de son don de crayons et qu’il avait pris le temps de faire de l’art. Elle était si fière de chaque dessin qu’il avait fini qu’elle savait que c’était ainsi qu’une mère se sentirait dans une telle situation.<br/><br/>La douleur qui l'avait traversée était trop, trop soudaine. Elle l'avait manqué et voulait voir combien il avait grandi depuis qu'elle était partie. Elle avait tellement manqué...<br/><br/>Pour s'épargner d'autres souffrances, de faux espoirs... elle a abandonné et s'est concentrée sur son amélioration.<br/><br/>B<br/><br/>Le petit déjeuner était fade, ennuyeux et inspiré. Ce n'est qu'après avoir terminé qu'elle s'est rendu compte qu'elle avait oublié toute sorte d'épices ou de saveur à la nourriture. Il était trop tard maintenant pour s’en souvenir, car son esprit était trop occupé à se souvenir d’autres détails de sa vie qui étaient clairement devenus plus importants que sa nourriture.<br/><br/>"Asseyez-vous!"<br/><br/>Bien sûr, rien ne s'est passé quand elle avait crié avec colère à un client particulièrement frustrant qui lui rappelait le demi-démon. Il était particulièrement têtu et impoli, voulant qu'une photo lui soit prise plutôt que de le laisser fonctionner naturellement. Vous pourriez essayer de forcer les animaux sauvages à se comporter comme vous le vouliez. Mais, rarement quelqu'un a réussi avec force. Inuyasha n'était pas aussi mauvais, cependant. Inuyasha avait appris avant qu'elle ait été forcée de s'éloigner de lui. Il était devenu plus doux, plus compréhensif, plus mature même s’il lui arrivait d’être encore puéril et arrogant.<br/><br/>Elle se souvient à quel point ses joues avaient brûlé, mais comment elle a tenu bon et l'a congédié. Elle lui a dit qu'elle refusait de travailler pour quelqu'un ou avec quelqu'un qui voulait tordre quelque chose au-delà de sa nature, au-delà de ses propres désirs.<br/><br/>Elle aurait dû comparer l'homme à Naraku plutôt qu'à Inuyasha. Bien que son client n'ait pas eu des intentions aussi extrêmes. Au moins le sentiment après était un souvenir agréable. La liberté de savoir qu'elle était venue si loin qu'elle pouvait refuser un travail qu'elle ne voulait pas faire, d'être sa propre personne qui était indépendante des autres. Elle pouvait dire qu'elle l'avait fait à ce moment-là. Même si elle a entendu des rumeurs quelques jours plus tard avec des mots destinés à la calomnier.<br/><br/>Elle s’est défendue avec justice, comme elle l’a fait vers la fin de son voyage. Après tout, elle était la seule qui pouvait se protéger dans ce monde.<br/><br/>B<br/><br/>La lumière du matin a commencé à se glisser dans sa maison, lui rappelant à nouveau le passage du temps. Encore une fois, elle a examiné la liste des choses qu'elle avait à faire et a débattu sur par où commencer. Ou, si elle devait même commencer du tout. Avec la façon dont la journée a commencé, elle ne savait pas si elle pouvait considérer que c'était une bonne idée. Il était douteux qu'elle réussirait avec la façon dont elle se perdait en elle-même.<br/><br/>Elle ne voulait pas gâcher son dernier travail. Parce qu'elle l'avait fait à quelques reprises auparavant. Ce n'était pas agréable d'essayer de se remettre d'une catastrophe complète.<br/><br/>Kagome se souvenait du sentiment qu'elle avait d'avoir un appareil photo tout neuf et coûteux qui lui glissait des mains. Elle n'était pas prête à le soutenir, car elle venait de le retirer de son sac. Une partie d'elle criait à l'intérieur. Un cri dramatique, over-the-top, plein qu'elle a souvent fait quand elle était beaucoup, beaucoup plus jeune. Quand elle avait du mal à passer à travers le collège tout en sautillant entre les temps. L'autre partie d'elle était restée gelée en place tandis que son objectif était complètement brisé et que le reste de l'appareil photo s'était cassé avec.<br/><br/>Voir le frère d'Inuyasha, un démon à part entière, se tenir devant elle était la dernière chose à laquelle elle s'attendait lorsqu'elle avait pris ses photos. Il était aussi fier que jamais, aussi grand que jamais, aussi imposant qu'elle se souvenait. Il ne semblait pas du tout déconcerté d'être dans un monde tout à fait différent, bien qu'elle n'ait jamais été la meilleure à lire son esprit. Son nom sur ses lèvres était si puissant, qu'elle pouvait se souvenir des sentiments les plus infimes comme elle le faisait. Ses lèvres étaient gercées, sa bouche était sèche et le bouillonnement d’anxiété dans son estomac la rendait malade.<br/><br/>Elle ne voulait pas que ses espoirs soient levés.<br/><br/>Mais, elle voulait qu'il soit là, même s'ils n'étaient pas amis. Ils étaient alliés, si quelque chose, puisqu'ils avaient combattu côte à côte. Et quelque chose valait mieux que absolument rien.<br/><br/>Et Kagome avait assez de bon sens pour ne pas se jeter sur lui, pour lui enrouler les bras en signe de soulagement, sachant qu’elle n’était pas seule. Elle se souvenait que rien d'autre n'avait d'importance pendant des jours alors qu'elle passait du temps avec lui, ne parlant pas de leur monde mais parlant (ou, elle parlait et il a simplement reconnu ce fait).<br/><br/>Mais Kagome ne s'en souvenait pas. C'était subtil, comme lui. Mais elle savait que le sentiment était là. Et il lui a fait savoir qu'elle n'était pas seule dans le fait qu'elle était tombée, que les sentiments s'étaient en quelque sorte épanouis.<br/><br/>B<br/><br/>Un sentiment d'apesanteur l'a rattrapée et tout à coup ses yeux se sont ouverts tandis que son esprit griffait désespérément pour la dernière chose qu'elle faisait. Elle ne se rappelait pas quand elle s'était endormie sur son canapé, mais elle savait que la dernière place qu'elle avait été était sur les coussins beaucoup trop confortables. Sa tête s'inclina contre la poitrine de Sesshoumaru, réconfortant dans le fait qu'il était ici et qu'elle n'était pas seule.<br/><br/>"Bienvenue." Sa réponse a été un bourdonnement doux en reconnaissance. Il n'avait pas besoin de parler beaucoup pour qu'elle comprenne son intention, ou le reste de ce qu'il avait à dire.<br/><br/>Il la ramenait à son lit, l’y installait avec aisance. Ses yeux rencontraient les siens et elle souriait facilement parce qu’il n’y avait plus de souvenirs à la dérive, plus de souvenirs taquinés. Non, chaque fois qu’il était proche, elle ne retombait jamais dans ces pensées. Il avait aidé, et les années avaient aidé. Aujourd'hui, c'était juste... un de ces jours.<br/><br/>"Dormir." Il commandait avec aisance, ses yeux roulaient vers lui mais elle ne se battait pas parce qu'elle était fatiguée. Sa main s'accrochait fermement à lui, tandis qu'elle sentait sa main opposée appuyer sur son front pour évaluer son bien-être.<br/><br/>"Je vais bien", dit-elle, ses mots fermes avec sa promesse.<br/><br/>Elle allait bien, elle était vivante, heureuse.<br/><br/>B<br/><br/>chargeur<br/><br/>Résumé<br/><br/>Kagome, à un moment de sa vie, était une adolescente plutôt régulière jusqu'à ce qu'elle soit attaquée par un démon dans la maison de sa famille. Le démon l'a traînée dans le puits, ce qui l'a transportée magiquement environ 500 ans dans le passé. Là, elle a appris qu'un bijou sacré était enfermé dans son corps comme elle était la réincarnation d'une prêtresse qui était morte 50 ans avant le moment où elle a été traînée dans. Le bijou a été arraché de son corps et le démon qui l'a traînée à travers le temps a été vaincu par le demi-démon qu'elle a libéré qui a été épinglé à l'arbre. Kagome se lia d'amitié avec le demi-démon, Inuyasha, dans le temps et voyagea avec lui pour restaurer le bijou qu'elle avait elle-même brisé. Bien que ce ne fût pas aussi simple et facile à faire que beaucoup de démons et d'humains cherchaient le bijou pour leurs propres fins. Elle se lia d'amitié avec un jeune démon kitsune, un moine et un tueur de démons qui voyageaient tous avec elle pour restaurer le bijou.<br/><br/>Son groupe, cependant, n'était pas celui qui a complété le bijou, mais plutôt un demi-démon maléfique qui a manipulé la majorité des événements majeurs dans la plupart des vies de son compagnon. Quand il a finalement recueilli toutes les pièces du bijou et a fait son souhait sur l'objet contaminé, Kagome a été attiré dans le bijou lui-même avec l'intention d'elle faire un désir égoïste de la garder piégée à l'intérieur pour toujours, en gardant le bijou vivant. C'est l'entêtement d'Inuyasha qui a réussi à la sauver de l'obscurité. À la fin, elle est revenue à son temps naturel, a terminé le lycée comme on l'attendait d'une fille de sa ligne du temps. Bien que quelques jours plus tard, Kagome a fini dans Elysion. Elle est dans ce monde depuis cinq ans et a depuis longtemps renoncé à rentrer chez elle. Elle s'est installée joyeusement dans sa nouvelle vie.<br/><br/>platonique<br/><br/>C'est plutôt facile pour Kagome de se faire de nouveaux amis, elle n'a pas beaucoup changé depuis sa jeunesse. C'est une jeune femme joyeuse qui est empathique et accueillante pour la plupart de sa vie. Dans sa jeunesse, elle s'est liée d'amitié avec les démons quand la plupart les craignaient. Même les démons qui avaient l'habitude de manger des humains, elle s'est liée d'amitié et elle a changé leurs façons (elle aimerait penser). Cela étant dit, il est vraiment facile de devenir son ami tant que quelqu'un est capable de montrer qu'ils sont prêts à être rachetés, ou montrer qu'ils ne sont pas complètement mauvais. Elle se sent beaucoup pour tous ceux qu'elle rencontre, il est donc difficile pour elle de ne pas être attirée par les autres dans le désir d'être amie.<br/><br/>antagonistes<br/><br/>La seule façon de gagner la colère de Kagome est d'être si déplorable, si mauvais, et tellement au-delà de la rédemption qu'elle ne peut voir aucun bien en vous. Et elle peut voir le bien dans à peu près tout le monde et tout. Honnêtement, avec qui elle a fait face? Un demi-démon qui a opposé deux amants l'un contre l'autre, qui a maudit toute la lignée masculine de l'un de ses amis, puis a fait tuer leur famille par le frère de sa meilleure amie... Ouais, je ne la vois pas haïr quelqu'un sans eux vraiment, vraiment travailler pour ça. Sentez-vous libre de lui donner un coup de feu, cependant.<br/><br/>romantique<br/><br/>Quand on est amoureux, Kagome est un soutien fort, toujours là, même quand les choses peuvent être difficiles. Cependant, Kagome ne cherche pas l'amour, ne cherchait pas l'amour quand elle est arrivée afin que les relations passées n'existent pas. Cela ne veut pas dire que quelqu'un n'est pas tombé amoureux d'elle. Elle peut certainement être le sujet de l'amour non partagé de quelqu'un, elle sera probablement inconsciente à ce sujet, cependant. Enfin, Kagome est actuellement fiancé à Sesshoumaru, étonnamment.

| Why You Should be on Twitter<br/><br/>Disclaimer: I am not, nor have I ever claimed to be, a social media guru. I'm just a person who thinks about stuff a lot, and this has come up a number of times.<br/><br/>I'm not an early adopter. Sometimes it takes me years to figure out what I want to use something for before I actually get on it, and Twitter was one of those things. I've been on Twitter seriously since about February of this year, so I'm pretty new at it. Still, I've learned a number of things, and I wanted to share them. Some people say I'm a Twitter pusher, and I am, because there's lots of good reasons to get on it, and virtually no downsides.<br/><br/>So what's Twitter? If you're on the internet, you've probably at least heard of it. It's a social media network that serves as a forum for conversations, updates, and news in a medium more public than something like Facebook or LinkedIn. Facebook is about who wants to find you, but Twitter is about who you want to find. Your favourite writers, actors, politicians, singers, and scientists are probably on Twitter. So are your favourite charities, radio stations, news sites, and stores. And they want you to find them and listen to what they have to say. Everyone on Twitter, at least initially, wants to talk with you.<br/><br/>But why join that? Why be a part of it? There's all kinds of reasons, and I'm going to give you a few.<br/><br/>People and Places Twitter is a great way to find out about events which are going on around the world, but also in your community. If you're travelling and looking for things to do, it's a great way to find out about things relevant to your interests (because the people you follow are people you're interested in). Even if you're not travelling, knowing about great places to go locally or knowing that people you're interested in are going to them creates an opportunity to meet them and create a deeper relationship with them. If you go back to my party post, all the people in it but two, I heard about on Twitter and then met in real life, and now we're pretty good friends. And the more you do this, the more things you'll find out about, and the more people you'll meet. And if you follow them on Twitter, you already know a bit about what they're like. They want you to. The reverse is also true, because tweeting invites people to see what you're like, and they can make the same choices about you.<br/><br/>Inspiration and Motivation<br/>Inspiration comes from the strangest places, and the influx of tweets means there's always fresh content for your imagination. I have a follow first policy, so I'll follow just about anybody, and then periodically go through and unfollow people. I don't know who's going to plant the seed of a new blog post or new project in me, so I like to keep my options open. Motivation also happens, because Twitter is just like life. If you surround yourself with people who are ambitious, dedicated, generous, and hard-working, it's easier to be like that, and push yourself. It's easier to think that if they can plan events, launch projects, or just get up in the morning, well, so can you.<br/><br/>Learning and Lifestyle Bloggers are on Twitter. Bloggers who aren't may actually be crazy. And people blog about just about everything. If you're looking to learn something, odds are good that somebody's tweeting about it. On top of that, news services and stores are also connected, which means that you can get your news up to the minute, and find out about sales and deals as they start.As far as lifestyle, looking for new recipe ideas? Follow some caterers and see what they come up with. Need a twist for that cocktail party? Twitter's got people for that too. Wardrobe recommendations, or just want to see what other people are doing with their lives? It's all there.<br/><br/>There are some common challenges I face when talking about this, and they're legitimate obstacles. It can seem pretty daunting, especially if you're getting on the bandwagon late, like I did. I spent months following only two people and not knowing what else to do. But there are ways to overcome them, and hear they are from least frequent to most.<br/><br/>#3: Twitter is for Narcissistic Jerks<br/>I think this comes from the idea that most people tweet for and about themselves as a way of getting attention. What I don't get is why there's anything wrong with that, or why doing that makes one a narcissist or a jerk. If someone has something to say, they want to be heard. Used to be you'd stand on the street corner and yell. Now you can yell in 140 characters or less. Twitter's just a new way to be heard. Now, there are certainly narcissistic jerks on Twitter. They're pretty much everywhere. Sometimes, people are jerks. Sometimes one of those people is me, I'm sorry to say. Don't follow those people. If you don't like what someone is saying, whether that's points that they're making or detailed accounts of their bathroom activities, you don't have to listen on Twitter.<br/><br/>#2: I Can't Keep Track of It All<br/>The second obstacle people often bring up is that they just don't have time to keep track of all the things which are going on on Twitter. And you know what? That's fine. Keep track of what you can. Maybe you only wander on every few days. If you're a private user (rather than tweeting for your company), and especially a beginner, that's okay. Part of something is better than all of nothing.<br/><br/>#1 I've Got Nothing I Want to Put Out There<br/>This is by far the most frequent challenge people raise. And it doesn't even matter. You don't have to join Twitter to talk. Join it to listen. Again, your favourite authors, singers, bloggers, and newspapers are on here. This is your chance to listen to them. It's your chance to gain a window into their lives and activities, and they're inviting you to do that. Want to find out what Felicia Day is going to be up to at the San Diego Comic Con? Done. I know people who only listen on Twitter, and that's great. That's what I did for a while. Eventually, maybe you'll find something to tweet about, or make something to tweet about. I hope you do, because I want to hear about it.<br/><br/>In short, if you're not using Twitter, I think you should be. If you're not using it to its full extent, try to. Don't be afraid to follow five hundred people, if all of those people are saying things you're interested in. Invite those people into bits of your life, and see how it's improved by the interaction. I look forward to hearing from you. | Pourquoi vous devriez être sur Twitter<br/><br/>Disclaimer: Je ne suis pas, et je n'ai jamais prétendu être, un gourou des médias sociaux. Je suis juste une personne qui pense beaucoup à des choses, et cela a été un certain nombre de fois.<br/><br/>Je ne suis pas un early adopter. Parfois, il me faut des années pour comprendre ce que je veux utiliser quelque chose pour avant que je sois réellement sur elle, et Twitter était une de ces choses. Je suis sur Twitter sérieusement depuis environ Février de cette année, donc je suis assez nouveau à elle. Pourtant, j'ai appris un certain nombre de choses, et je voulais les partager. Certaines personnes disent que je suis un pousseur Twitter, et je le suis, parce qu'il y a beaucoup de bonnes raisons de s'y mettre, et pratiquement aucun inconvénient.<br/><br/>Alors qu'est-ce que Twitter? Si vous êtes sur Internet, vous en avez probablement au moins entendu parler. C'est un réseau de médias sociaux qui sert de forum pour les conversations, les mises à jour et les nouvelles dans un média plus public que quelque chose comme Facebook ou LinkedIn. Facebook parle de qui veut vous trouver, mais Twitter parle de qui vous voulez trouver. Vos écrivains, acteurs, politiciens, chanteurs et scientifiques préférés sont probablement sur Twitter. Tout comme vos organismes de bienfaisance, stations de radio, sites d'actualités et magasins préférés. Et ils veulent que vous les trouviez et que vous écoutiez ce qu'ils ont à dire. Tout le monde sur Twitter, au moins au début, veut parler avec vous.<br/><br/>Il y a toutes sortes de raisons, et je vais vous en donner quelques-unes.<br/><br/>People and Places Twitter est un excellent moyen de se renseigner sur les événements qui se déroulent dans le monde entier, mais aussi dans votre communauté. Si vous voyagez et que vous cherchez des choses à faire, c'est un excellent moyen de découvrir des choses pertinentes pour vos intérêts (parce que les personnes que vous suivez sont des personnes qui vous intéressent). Même si vous ne voyagez pas, connaître de bons endroits où aller localement ou savoir que les gens qui vous intéressent vont vers eux crée une occasion de les rencontrer et de créer une relation plus profonde avec eux. Si vous revenez à mon post du parti, tous les gens, sauf deux, j'ai entendu parler sur Twitter et puis rencontré dans la vraie vie, et maintenant nous sommes assez bons amis. Et plus vous faites ceci, plus vous découvrirez de choses, et plus vous rencontrerez de gens. Et si vous les suivez sur Twitter, vous savez déjà à quoi ils ressemblent. Ils veulent que vous le fassiez. L'inverse est également vrai, car tweeter invite les gens à voir ce que vous êtes, et ils peuvent faire les mêmes choix à votre sujet.<br/><br/>Inspiration et motivation<br/>L'inspiration vient des endroits les plus étranges, et l'afflux de tweets signifie qu'il y a toujours du contenu frais pour votre imagination. J'ai une politique de suivre d'abord, donc je vais suivre à peu près n'importe qui, puis périodiquement passer par et ne plus suivre les gens. Je ne sais pas qui va planter la graine d'un nouveau billet de blog ou d'un nouveau projet en moi, alors j'aime garder mes options ouvertes. La motivation arrive aussi, parce que Twitter est comme la vie. Si vous vous entourez de personnes ambitieuses, dévouées, généreuses et travailleuses, il est plus facile d’être comme ça et de vous pousser. Il est plus facile de penser que s'ils peuvent planifier des événements, lancer des projets ou simplement se lever le matin, eh bien, vous le pouvez aussi.<br/><br/>Les blogueurs sont sur Twitter. Les blogueurs qui ne le sont pas sont peut-être fous. Et les gens bloguent sur à peu près tout. Si vous cherchez à apprendre quelque chose, il y a de fortes chances que quelqu'un tweete à ce sujet. En plus de cela, les services de nouvelles et les magasins sont également connectés, ce qui signifie que vous pouvez obtenir vos nouvelles à la minute, et en savoir plus sur les ventes et les offres dès qu'ils commencent. En ce qui concerne le style de vie, à la recherche de nouvelles idées de recettes? Suivez quelques traiteurs et voyez ce qu'ils proposent. Besoin d'un twist pour ce cocktail? Twitter a des gens pour ça aussi. Recommandations de garde-robe, ou juste envie de voir ce que les autres font de leur vie? C'est tout là.<br/><br/>Il y a des défis communs auxquels je dois faire face quand j'en parle, et ce sont des obstacles légitimes. Cela peut sembler assez intimidant, surtout si vous prenez le train en retard, comme je l'ai fait. J'ai passé des mois à ne suivre que deux personnes et à ne pas savoir quoi faire d'autre. Mais il existe des moyens de les surmonter et d'entendre qu'ils sont du moins fréquent au plus fréquent.<br/><br/>Twitter est pour Narcissistic Jerks<br/>Je pense que cela vient de l'idée que la plupart des gens tweetent pour et à propos d'eux-mêmes comme un moyen d'attirer l'attention. Ce que je ne comprends pas, c'est pourquoi il y a quelque chose de mal avec cela, ou pourquoi faire cela fait un narcissique ou un imbécile. Si quelqu'un a quelque chose à dire, ils veulent être entendus. Autrefois, vous vous teniez au coin de la rue et criez. Maintenant, vous pouvez crier en 140 caractères ou moins. Twitter est juste une nouvelle façon d'être entendu. Maintenant, il y a certainement des imbéciles narcissiques sur Twitter. Parfois, les gens sont des imbéciles. Parfois, l'une de ces personnes, c'est moi, je suis désolé de le dire. Ne suivez pas ces gens. Si vous n'aimez pas ce que quelqu'un dit, que ce soit des points qu'ils font ou des comptes détaillés de leurs activités de salle de bain, vous n'avez pas à écouter sur Twitter.<br/><br/>N°2 : Je ne peux pas tout suivre<br/>Le deuxième obstacle que les gens soulèvent souvent est qu'ils n'ont tout simplement pas le temps de suivre toutes les choses qui se passent sur Twitter. Et vous savez quoi? C'est bien. Gardez une trace de ce que vous pouvez. Peut-être que vous ne vous promenez que quelques jours. Si vous êtes un utilisateur privé (plutôt que de tweeter pour votre entreprise), et surtout un débutant, ce n'est pas grave. Une partie de quelque chose est mieux que tout le néant.<br/><br/>N ° 1 Je n'ai rien que je veux mettre là-bas<br/>C'est de loin le défi le plus fréquent que les gens soulèvent. Et cela n'a même pas d'importance. Vous n'avez pas besoin de rejoindre Twitter pour parler. Rejoignez-le pour écouter. Encore une fois, vos auteurs, chanteurs, blogueurs et journaux préférés sont ici. C'est votre chance de les écouter. C'est votre chance d'avoir une fenêtre sur leur vie et leurs activités, et ils vous invitent à le faire. Vous voulez savoir ce que Felicia Day va faire au Comic Con de San Diego? Je connais des gens qui n'écoutent que sur Twitter, et c'est génial. C'est ce que j'ai fait pendant un moment. Finalement, peut-être que vous trouverez quelque chose à tweeter, ou à faire quelque chose à tweeter. J'espère que vous le faites, parce que je veux en entendre parler.<br/><br/>En bref, si vous n'utilisez pas Twitter, je pense que vous devriez l'utiliser. Si vous ne l'utilisez pas pleinement, essayez de le faire. N'ayez pas peur de suivre cinq cents personnes, si toutes ces personnes disent des choses qui vous intéressent. Invitez ces personnes dans des moments de votre vie, et voyez comment cela s'est amélioré grâce à l'interaction. |
| Root Canals<br/><br/>The very thought of getting a root canal puts most people on edge. SCM Dental utilizes the latest technology and technique to make a root canal a virtually pain free and low stress procedure.<br/><br/>Rotary endodontics is an advanced technology and technique to perform endodontic treatment, the clinical term for a root canalThe term "root canal" refers to the natural cavity at the center of the tooth. The tooth's nerve is located in soft tissue (pulp) inside the root canal. If the tooth is damaged either by trauma or decay, debris can enter the sensitive root canal area and cause an infection, or in extreme circumstances, and abscess. An abscessed tooth is very serious and should be treated as an emergency, as it can create an infection that may spread to other parts of the body. If you believe you have an abscessed tooth, contact our office immediately to schedule emergency care.<br/><br/>Depending on the case, root canal therapy may require more than one visit. An initial x-ray will be taken to evaluate the tooth and root canal and determine the extent of the damage and infection if present. You will be given a form of anesthesia to make you relaxed.<br/><br/>When the area is numb, our dentist will create an access chamber to the root canal using an electric handpiece. Next, the root canal will be scraped of the infected or damaged tissue and nerve. Once the entire area has been throughly cleaned and polished, the tooth will be filled with a biocompatible rubber compound called gutta percha. The tooth is then covered with a dental filling or dental crown to restore strength and function.<br/><br/>Endodontic therapy has a bad reputation as being a painful procedure. With rotary endodontics, a root canal procedure is no more painful than having a dental filling placed. The infection and damage to the nerve is what creates the extreme pain and discomfort and patients you will experience significant relief after undergoing root canal therapy. Root canals have a success rate of 95% and allow people to preserve their natural teeth. | Canaux racinaires<br/><br/>La pensée même d'obtenir un canal radiculaire met la plupart des gens sur le bord. SCM Dental utilise la dernière technologie et la technique pour faire un canal radiculaire une procédure pratiquement sans douleur et faible stress.<br/><br/>L'endodontie rotative est une technologie et une technique de pointe pour effectuer un traitement endodontique, le terme clinique pour un canal radiculaireLe terme "canal radiculaire" fait référence à la cavité naturelle au centre de la dent. Le nerf de la dent est situé dans les tissus mous (pulpe) à l'intérieur du canal radiculaire. Si la dent est endommagée par un traumatisme ou une carie, les débris peuvent pénétrer dans la zone sensible du canal radiculaire et causer une infection, ou dans des circonstances extrêmes, et un abcès. Une dent abcès est très grave et doit être traitée comme une urgence, car elle peut créer une infection qui peut se propager à d'autres parties du corps. Si vous croyez que vous avez un abcès dentaire, contactez immédiatement notre bureau pour planifier des soins d'urgence.<br/><br/>Selon le cas, le traitement de canal peut nécessiter plus d'une visite. Une radiographie initiale sera prise pour évaluer la dent et le canal radiculaire et déterminer l'étendue des dommages et de l'infection, le cas échéant. Vous recevrez une forme d'anesthésie pour vous détendre.<br/><br/>Lorsque la zone est engourdie, notre dentiste créera une chambre d'accès au canal radiculaire à l'aide d'une pièce à main électrique. Ensuite, le canal radiculaire sera gratté des tissus et des nerfs infectés ou endommagés. Une fois que toute la zone a été nettoyée et polie, la dent sera remplie d'un composé de caoutchouc biocompatible appelé gutta percha. La dent est ensuite recouverte d'une obturation dentaire ou d'une couronne dentaire pour rétablir la force et la fonction.<br/><br/>La thérapie endodontique a mauvaise réputation comme étant une procédure douloureuse. Avec l'endodontie rotative, une procédure de canal radiculaire n'est pas plus douloureuse que d'avoir une obturation dentaire placée. L'infection et les dommages au nerf sont ce qui crée la douleur et l'inconfort extrêmes et les patients, vous ressentirez un soulagement significatif après avoir subi un traitement de canal. Les canaux radiculaires ont un taux de réussite de 95% et permettent aux gens de préserver leurs dents naturelles. |
| Churchyard Bottom Wood<br/><br/>Highgate<br/><br/>Churchyard Bottom Wood, Highgate<br/><br/>Now called Queen's Wood<br/><br/>Between 1860 and 1880 the centre was torn out of the City of London to build sewers, railways and new roads. Houses were demolished without regard for the tenants who had to find whatever accommodation they could elsewhere. Managers went to livo in Kensington and St. John's Wood, while the poorest crowded into the rookeries like Seven Dials and Lisson Grove. For those between, the clerks and skilled workmen, speculative builders put up row after row of terraced villas and Mr Pooter moved into Holloway. The people of Muswell Hill watched houses creep across the fields of Finsbury Park, up Crouch Hill and down the other side, so that by 1880, Crouch End was being developed and there seemed no way to stem the flow. Ten years later the large estates of Muswell Hill were being sold. Upton Farm was sold and the Ecclesiastical Commissioners wanted to develop Churchyard Bottom Wood, now called Queen's Wood. The story would have made an Ibsen play. Two groups of honest, highly motivated people fighting for what they each thought was right. The Ecclesiastical Commissioners on the one hand and the Committee of the Hornsey Charities on the other, both believed they were doing their best for other people, and the public rose against them both in indignation<br/><br/>At that time Muswell Hill Road was a country road, with Southwood Hall at one end and Upton Farm at the other. By 1894, Onslow Gardens was built, Connaught Gardens marked out, and builders were poised to develop the Woodlands estate. Cut out of Churchyard Bottom Wood was a group of tumble-down cottages, on a triangular site. An undated map, held by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners shows six Wasteland Cottages with an opening between them - not a road, not metalled, but a way through to the strawberry beds behind. Further along was another gap which led to footpaths through the wood. These two openings were to be the basis of the plan. The same two gaps and the cleared ground, which was the strawberry field, can be seen in the 1894 map below. They are shown as 'Muswell Hill Cottages' and, quite in passing, Peter Sellers was to live on the same site much later on. To develop the wood as a housing estate, the Commissioners needed to drive two roads through from Muswell Hill Road and build houses along them. The Muswell Hill Road frontage alone would not have provided room for enough houses to make the venture worthwhile.<br/><br/>The land and cottages had been given much earlier as almshouses to house old people and were held on their behalf by the Trustees of the Hornsey Charity Commissioners. By the 1890s the cottages were tumble-down, in need of major repair. Public-spirited, wishing to do the best for their old tenants, the Trustees could not improve them since they had no money. Some years before the Ecclesiastical Commissioners had planned to develop Gravel Pit Wood (now Highgate Wood) as a housing estate, but this had met such opposition that they backed down. Instead, in 1886, they gave all 69 acres woodland to the public. At the same time they offered to sell Churchyard Bottom Wood to Hornsey Urban District Council for £25,000, but this was too much for Hornsey to raise on its own. The Council said that people living outside Hornsey also enjoyed the wood and other authorities should help, but no help was given. In the end the offer fell into abeyance.<br/><br/>Map showing the Muswell Hill Cottages which were the centre of the controversy.<br/><br/>Muswell Hill Road about 1880<br/><br/>It seems probable that these three pairs of cottages<br/>were the ones at the centre of the dispute.<br/><br/>The Ecclesiastical Commissioners wanted to raise money for its church work in Britain and abroad. They considered that they had been given the land to be used for the propogat­ion of religion and if this meant selling off land or woods, it was a lesser evil than restricting the work of the church. They had given Gravel Pit Wood to the public: in its place they would develop Churchyard Bottom Wood.<br/><br/>The Trustees of the Hornsey Charities wanted to produce an income to help their poor people, so they made an offer to the Commissioners. Their triangular piece of land was too awkwardly shaped to be developed economically, but if the Commissioners would grant them some more land to make it into a square site, they would build twenty-five neat villas. These would bring in ground rents of £225 per annum, which could be used to relieve the poverty of Hornsey people. In return they would permit the Commission­ers to cut two roads through their land so that the Commissioners could develop the woods.<br/><br/>When this offer became known people immediately reacted with alarm.<br/><br/>On the 16th December 1893 Mr Carvell Williams MP asked in the House of Commons, if the Ecclesiastical Commissioners had consented to sell a strip of land to the Hornsey Charities Trustees on condition that an existing road be widened to 40 feet, whether this was a preliminary to a building scheme and if the House of Parliament would have an opportunity to express an opinion.<br/><br/>Mr Leveson Gower, a Church Estates Commissioner replied',"Yes" to the first part.<br/><br/>Mr Carvell Williams, "Do I understand it is the intention to destroy that portion of Highgate Woods by building on it?"<br/><br/>Two days later The Star published an article worthy of any modern tabloid.<br/><br/>The Star<br/>18th December 1893<br/><br/>'Parliament must keep a keen watch on those old vandals and confederates of the jerry-builder the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. They are always alienating some piece of land or are favouring the builders as opposed to the general public. The Commissioners would not sell the Churchyard Bottom wood to the ratepayers but now propose 'to open it up' by cutting two wide roads through it in connection with one of their numerous building schemes. Will not someone ask a question in Parliament and check the brick and mortar policy of the Commissioners?'<br/><br/>By the time this was printed, the question had been asked and the answer was either untrue, or devious. Other papers took up the story. The Times, in a long report, said that the Comnussioners were not prepared to give an undertaking that Parliament, or any other public body, should have an opportunity of considering any scheme for building on the site of the wood.<br/><br/>The situation simmered for eighteen months until the Ecclesiastical Commissioners were forced to open an enquiry, which began at Highgate on 31 May 1895, chaired by an Assistant Ecclesiastical Commissioner. The Inquiry produced a flurry of newspaper letters of which this was the most important.<br/><br/>The Daily Chronicle, 5 June 1895<br/><br/>VANDALISM AT HIGHGATE<br/><br/>Sir –<br/><br/>One of the most lovely bits of woodland in suburan London is threatened. Will you help us to ward off what would be a calamity, not only to the immediate district, but to the whole of densely-populated North London? In no part of the metropolis has the builder been more active than in Crouch End and Hornsey. The beautiful meadows of a year or two ago are now houses and shops. Ballast heaps have taken the place of stately elms and chestnuts, and once pleasant villages are sharing the fate of Stroud Green, Harringay, Finsbury Park, Highbury and Islington. ---<br/><br/>---- The object is the construction of two forty-foot roads through the woods. We in this district know the meaning of forty-foot roads through woods. It means that the woods are doomed. Ten years ago agitation saved the sister-wood of sixty-five acres - The Gravel Pit Woods - and no one who saw the Bank Holiday crowds flocking up the Archway Road from the dreary streets of Holloway, Islington and Clerkenwell, and watched the keen enjoyment of the children and family parties picnicking on the grass and among the trees, could fail to realise the immense boon that the grant by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners of this wood has been to the whole of North London, but the Lower Wood of sixty acres has always been regarded as a natural complement of the other. ----<br/><br/>--- The Ecclesiastical Commissioners own nearly one-third of the large parish of Hornsey. By the liberal expenditure of the ratepayers' money in the opening up of roads and the general development of the district, the value of their property has been enormously increased, and from this unearned increment they each year draw large revenues. Surely the ratepayers whose money has thus aided in creating the immense estate may expect liberal treatment in return. ---<br/><br/>Yours obediently,<br/><br/>Signed by The Vicar of St James', Muswell Hill, the Minister of Park Chapel, Crouch End, a barrister living in Onslow Gardens and three members of the District Council.<br/><br/>It was a shot right across the bows of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. Their own religious leaders and the District Council, all up in arms saying in effect that the church was too rich and should be charitable, not greedy. The inclusion of the two clergymen was a shrewd move. Remember to that this was still in the height of the Darwin controversy. Darwin had split belief in the teachings of the Church and many people would have resented the power of the Church from that point of view alone. The Church was not so secure as it pretended to be.<br/><br/>The Evening News, 7 June 1895 said:-<br/><br/>"If the Ecclesiastical Comnussioners are not tackled at once, the building octopus will get a grip of the wood which will be very difficult to loosen later on, ---. Therefore it behoves Londoners to be up and doing if they would save one of their most delightful bits of rustic scenery. The public inquiry stands adjourned to Thursday next, and before then something must be done to convince the Commissioners that the citizens of London will not tolerate the confiscation of one of their favourite playgrounds."<br/><br/>A letter in the Daily Chronicle the next day said:-<br/><br/>.... It was with great relief that that the residents, some ten years ago, heard that the purchase of the Upper Wood had been effected; and how delightful a boon this has proved, anyone who visited them can testify, but all who exerted themselves to save these upper woods, which lie on the west side of Muswell Hill road, felt that their victory was incomplete so long as the sixty acres on the east side remained in danger. It is, as it were, an accident that the woods are divided by a broad high road. Can anyone doubt what the effect would be if the Churchyard Bottom Wood were replaced by rows of small villas, each sending out its contribution of smoke and soot? Can anyone doubt, too, the serious difference it would make to the picturesque setting of the purchased woods if a line of staring new houses were to be run up right over against their leafy frontage?'<br/><br/>This expressed the opinions of many people. In fact, the Gravel Pit Wood, which the writer calls the 'Upper Wood', had not been purchased, but given to the district by the Ecclesiastical Commission, a point they were to reiterate time and again over the years, but most people ignored it. The Commission was not going to give away a second wood whatever anyone said, and held this position to the end.<br/><br/>H.S.Chamberlain, of 5 Cranley Gardens,<br/>in a letter to the Times dated June 8, 1895, urged purchase.<br/><br/>I know that it is common to speak harshly of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, but as the trustees of a fund they are bound to administer it to the greatest advantage, and therefore, if anything is to be done to save the demolition of the wood, it appears to me that it can only be effected by the purchase of the property from the Comnussioners, who I know, are fully alive to the protection of free and open spaces for the people, and who, I feel sure, would be disposed to treat the matter of a purchase in a free and liberal spirit, as they have already done in the matter of the Shepherd's Cot-field, by granting a lease to the Crouch End Playing-fields Company - a small company in which I own a few shares, a small company which was formed exclusively for the purpose of securing the fields for cricket, tennis etc.<br/><br/>(This refers the the Crouch End Playing Fields which had been secured a few years later.)<br/><br/>As Chairman of the Muswell Hill Conservative Association, I am constantly in touch with the inhabitants, and I can safely affirm that every person resident in the neighbourhood would do anything in reason to preserve.<br/><br/>(All he wanted personally was Charity income to support his poor people. He demanded his acre of land - not a great deal surely - he believed the Commissioners' assurance that the wood was not in danger.)<br/><br/>' Muswell Hill Road was one of the best in Hornsey and would remain equally beautiful, houses or no houses',<br/><br/>(and then came the great rhetorical flourish.)<br/><br/>'Are the poor to suffer because of the sentimental objections and the hysterical cry of 'wolf just raised by your correspondents? Something must be done and that soon. An acre of back-land added to the charity-estate would make no apprec­iable difference to the land remaining, while the profit derived from it would succour many poor old and deserving persons in their declining years and enable us to hand over to our successors an estate which in the distant future would be of great value in the rendering of charitable aid to the deserving poor of the parish of Hornsey.'<br/><br/>Reading his letter one senses hysteria very near the surface. Why did he think the Commissioners wanted to build a road? Why should they spend all that money if not to build houses? He never seemed to realise that for an acre of land the the whole wood would be lost. But he had been with the problem for a long time. He was the person to whom the Commissioners had made the offer of sale for £25,000 years before and it is his name which is honoured in a plaque on Crouch End Clock Tower for saving the wood, but his trust in the Ecclesiastical Commissioners seems naive. It is sad that at the Inquiry he was to be cast as the devil.<br/><br/>The Inquiry Continued<br/><br/>The adjourned opened in Highgate on 15 June 1895. Expecting a large gather­ing, the Council Chamber had been changed completely. The usual tables had been removed and the room filled with chairs. By half past seven the room was crowded, with people jostling for seats.<br/><br/>Mr Murray, the Commissioner, said the Inquiry was really a simple one. Hornsey Parochial Charities wished to purchase a piece of land adjoining their charity property at the back. The question was whether the Charity Commission, which controlled all charities, had enough power to stop them. The Church Commissioners were prepared to sell the land at very favourable terms and the income of the Charity would be very considerable increased.<br/><br/>Against this there were three classes of objection.<br/><br/>The original Trust was for the purpose of providing cottages for the Poor, but the trustees were proposing to build villas which would be too expensive for the Poor. However, it was within the power of the Trustees to vary the terms of the Trust, so they could build villas if they thought that the Poor would benefit in the end. The poor people themselves might object, but liberal provisions had already been promised for them. The third objection related to the aesthetic and public side of the question. He took it from what he had read that the Charity Commission ought to interfere to prevent the Ecclesiastical Commissioners from exercising their own discretion in dealing with their own property.<br/><br/>The Inquiry discussed fine points, but the speakers kept coming back to the major problem of preventing any destruction of the wood. The Vestry Clerk of Islington, representing 300,000 people, made a formal protest about any part of the wood, so valuable for the people of Islington and Hornsey being used for private purposes. Mr Wilfred White said that if the Commissioners would give them time they would be able to raise the money to compensate the Trustees.<br/><br/>Mr Beaumont said they did not want villas, they wanted cottages for poor people who were being driven out of the district. Others said that there was no money to build cottages to replace the present delapidated ones but villas would be an economic proposition. Others retorted that there were score of villas to let in Highgate. The Wood was sacred. Stick to the question of the Wood.<br/><br/>Dr Fletcher said the cry among the working people was that there was nowhere to go. Working people came to him with the cry, "We are driven out of Highgate and are obliged to go to Highgate New Town." If the Muswell Hill Road frontage was sold there was no question but that roads might be cut right through the woods in the direction of Hornsey, but if the Commissioners could not get the land from the Charity Commission they could not cut the road.<br/><br/>He was very sure the cottages could be put into a fit state of repair. He was asked by the poor people, by the police and by a number of the working classes to represent these two points, that cottage accommodation was very sorely needed in Highgate and that if they once allowed the land to be sold, there was no telling where the hand of the builder would be stayed.<br/><br/>(Loud and prolonged cheers).<br/><br/>Numerous other people spoke and the Comnussioner summed up by saying that he took it that the prevailing opinion was in favour of retaining the cottages but the meeting should draw no conclusions from what he had said (Groans).<br/><br/>Others said that the Trustees of the Charity had failed in their duties by letting the the cottages fall into disrepair.<br/><br/>Mr H.R.Williams, the Trustee who had written to the paper earlier, said that he had it on the best authority that the Church Commissioners would make no roads whatever and they would not be benefitted one iota by the actions of the Charity Commissioners. Others were far less trusting and the meeting closed after nearly three hours.<br/><br/>'We are faced with the fact that in Highgate and Muswell Hill there are a number of persons who want the Churchyard Bottom Wood and will not be happy until they have got it - while nobody appears willing to spend a farthing to pay for it. Everyone says it would be a fine thing to have the wood as open space, but everybody thinks it is the duty of someone else to make it one. The Islington Vestry has 'resolved' on the subject, but the Islington Vestry does not offer a penny piece towards the purchase. --- There is no more difficult problem for the community or the individual to solve than how to gain possession of other people's property without paying for it.'<br/><br/>Paying for it was indeed the problem as Churchyard Bottom Wood became the subject of intense local and national debate. A joint committee was formed to raise money to save the wood. On 20 November 1896, C.F.Cory-Wright, Hon Treasurer, wrote to The Standard, a daily paper at that time, appealing for help. He reminded everyone of the danger of losing the wood and said it could only be saved by buying it. The Church Commissioners would sell for £25,000 and an extra (5,000 would be required for fencing and drainage, making a total of £30,000. This was too much for Hornsey Council to raise but they had already voted £10,000 towards the total. The woods were of inestimable value to all of North London so he appealed to public bodies and private people to raise the remaining £20,000. He warned that the present offer from the Church Commissioners was open only to the end of 1898. After that the builders would move in.<br/><br/>The appeal was warmly welcomed by the press. A Private Bill was rushed through Parliament and the Highgate Woods Preservation Act, 1897, became law. The Conunittee now had the right to advertise for contributions towards buying the Wood and preserving it.<br/><br/>In a fairly short time almost all the money was raised, but the last few thousand proved very difficult to raise and the Commissioners' deadline was a matter of weeks away. Mr Cory-Wright wrote pleading for more time but was granted a mere three months and then only if interest at 4 per cent was paid for the extra period on the full sum. In the end the London County Council, which had originally offered £2,500, made this up to £5,000 and the total was reached, but it was a close-run thing.<br/><br/>The Council decided to re-name the Wood as 'Queen's Woods' in honour of Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee and Hornsey put on a fine display of bunting when the Duchess of Albany formally declared the Wood open 'for the free use of the public for ever'.<br/><br/>While the campaign to save Churchyard Bottom Wood was run and directed by local people who felt passionately about this particular piece of woodland, they called on the help and experience of a vast network of people, some of whom had worked together on similar campaigns for over thirty years. The Committee issued an appeal, printed on very good quality paper and bearing some famous names.<br/><br/>The questions of open space and public health were major subjects of the Victorian vision.<br/><br/>The Open Spaces Movement<br/><br/>Octavia Hill, the great housing reformer, who had begun with three old houses in Marylebone, bought for her by Jolm Ruskin, had quickly become an expert on housing poor people in the healthiest conditions possible. Her way was to buy leases and then knock down some of the crowded houses in order to bring light and air to the rest, believing that fresh air and sunlight were the the only way poor people could be saved from 'putrid fever. She had learnt this as a child from her grandfather, Southwood Smith, who developed his theories at the Fever Hospital at King's Cross.<br/><br/>He had built the first Industrial Dwellings for poor people and had proved statistically that good air and decent drainage saved lives. Gibson Gardens, in Northwold Road, is a direct outcome of Southwood Smith's ideas. More Information on Gibson Gardens<br/><br/>The Importance of Open Air<br/><br/>Open spaces and the opportunity to breathe clean air, were essential for people living in one or two crowded rooms. Octavia Hill took her charges from the Lisson Grove slums, up Fitzjohn's Avenue to Hampstead Heath. She so loved the Fitzjohn's Avenue fields that she tried to buy them as a public park. They were to cost £10,000 and within three August weeks £8,500 had been raised. It needed only the end of the summer holidays and the return from holiday of sympathetic friends and the further £1,500 would have been raised, but the owners suddenly withdrew their offer. Despite all pleading, the fields were covered with large houses.<br/><br/>From this developed the campaign to save Parliament Hill, the next open space northwards from Lisson Grove, buying up fields in the path of the builders to make a permanent cordon sanitalre against the advancing bricks. The Parliament Hill Fields campaign was so successful that the Hampstead Heath Bill was passed and there was money over from the appeal. From this money and the impetus towards open spaces, was to develop the National Trust. Octavia Hill had been interested in protecting areas like Church Bottom Wood for years, so she was a natural ally in the fight to save the Wood.<br/><br/>The Commons Preservation Society also, was familiar with this kind of agitation and money collection. They had torn down fencing when lords of the manor had enclosed pieces of common land, leading both legal and illegal battles against the arrogant privatization of land traditionally free. Robert Hunter, their Honorary Solicitor from 1868, was always concerned with securing open spaces, large or small, for the public. He, now Sir Robert Hunter, became the Chairman of the Church Bottom Appeal. The Chairman of the Commons Preservation Society was Mr Shaw-Lefevre MP (later Lord Eversley) who played a big part in this and other campaigns in the House of Commons. Octavia Hill had been involved in their work from about 1875.<br/><br/>At the same time Octavia Hill was campaigning for a Burials Bill.<br/><br/>City churchyards had become so full and such a serious a hazard to health, by contaminating wells from which people drew their drinking water, that City burials were no longer permitted. Instead, cemetries were created on the outskirts of town. Abney Park Cemetary was one of these. There was then a movement to remove the headstones to the edges of the old town cemetries, re-inter the bodies elsewhere and turn the cemetries into gardens and open spaces, instead of building on them. This land in the centre of London was very valuable and speculators were avid to obtain it: Even the Quakers had built over one of their cemetries and threatened to do so again by building over Bunhill Fields. Octavia Hill had a network of allies in a dozen fields, so her help to save the Church Bottom Wood must have been invaluable.<br/><br/>The Metropolitan Gardens Society, set up in 1882, had laid out about two hundred small gardens in city centres by 1890. They later handed them over to the Local Authorities, so their support for the Churchyard Bottom Wood Appeal was assured from the start.<br/><br/>The Kyrle Society is forgotten now, but in its day had great influence on Town Planning and Open Space legislation. The Society had been set up about 1875 for 'the Diffusion of Beauty', to bring colour and interest into the lives of people living in dull, drab surroundings. Bright colour to walls and decoration, good singing, open spaces, Nature, Literature and Art. All these fell within the Society's remit. There was a Decorative Branch, for whom William Morris lectured; a Musical Branch to promote choirs and Happy Evenings for people in local school buildings; and a Literature Branch. The Society appealed regularly by letters in The Times, to 'the richer classes' for books and periodicals to be distributed to boys' and girls' clubs, almshouses and elsewhere. However the Open Spaces Committee was the most active. The very name 'Kyrle' came from Pope's The Man of Ross, the philanthropist who gave his birthplace to the people as a public park. | Churchyard fond bois<br/><br/>Highgate<br/><br/>Churchyard Bottom Bois, Highgate<br/><br/>Aujourd'hui appelé Queen's Wood<br/><br/>Entre 1860 et 1880, le centre fut arraché de la ville de Londres pour construire des égouts, des chemins de fer et de nouvelles routes. Les maisons furent démolies sans égard pour les locataires qui devaient trouver n'importe quel logement ailleurs. Les gestionnaires sont allés à livo à Kensington et St. John's Wood, tandis que les plus pauvres se sont entassés dans les roqueries comme Seven Dials et Lisson Grove. Pour ceux entre, les commis et les ouvriers qualifiés, les constructeurs spéculatifs mis rangée après rangée de villas mitoyennes et M. Pooter déplacé à Holloway. Les habitants de Muswell Hill ont vu des maisons se faufiler à travers les champs de Finsbury Park, le long de Crouch Hill et de l’autre côté, de sorte qu’en 1880, Crouch End était en cours de développement et il ne semblait pas y avoir moyen d’endiguer le flux. Dix ans plus tard, les grands domaines de Muswell Hill ont été vendus. Upton Farm a été vendu et les commissaires ecclésiastiques voulaient développer Churchyard Bottom Wood, maintenant appelé Queen's Wood. L'histoire aurait fait une pièce d'Ibsen. Deux groupes de gens honnêtes et très motivés qui se battent pour ce qu’ils pensaient être juste. Les commissaires ecclésiastiques, d'une part, et le Comité des œuvres caritatives de Hornsey, d'autre part, croyaient tous deux faire de leur mieux pour les autres, et le public s'est élevé contre eux tous les deux avec indignation.<br/><br/>À cette époque, Muswell Hill Road était une route de campagne, avec Southwood Hall à une extrémité et Upton Farm à l'autre. En 1894, Onslow Gardens a été construit, Connaught Gardens délimité, et les constructeurs étaient prêts à développer le domaine Woodlands. Découpé dans Churchyard Bottom Wood était un groupe de chalets dégringolés, sur un site triangulaire. Une carte non datée, tenue par les commissaires ecclésiastiques, montre six Wasteland Cottages avec une ouverture entre eux - pas une route, pas en métal, mais un chemin à travers les lits de fraises derrière. Plus loin, il y avait un autre espace qui conduisait à des sentiers à travers le bois. Ces deux ouvertures devaient être à la base du plan. Les mêmes deux espaces et le sol dégagé, qui était le champ de fraises, peuvent être vus sur la carte de 1894 ci-dessous. Ils sont montrés comme 'Muswell Hill Cottages' et, tout à fait en passant, Peter Sellers devait vivre sur le même site beaucoup plus tard. Pour développer le bois en tant que lotissement, les commissaires devaient traverser deux routes à partir du chemin Muswell Hill et construire des maisons le long de celles-ci. La façade de Muswell Hill Road à elle seule n'aurait pas permis d'avoir suffisamment de maisons pour que l'entreprise en vaille la peine.<br/><br/>Les terres et les chalets avaient été donnés beaucoup plus tôt comme maisons d'aumônes pour loger les personnes âgées et étaient détenus en leur nom par les fiduciaires des Hornsey Charity Commissioners. Dans les années 1890, les chalets étaient démolis, nécessitant des réparations majeures. Soucieux de l’intérêt public et désireux de faire de leur mieux pour leurs anciens locataires, les administrateurs ne pouvaient pas les améliorer puisqu’ils n’avaient pas d’argent. Quelques années avant que les commissaires ecclésiastiques n’aient l’intention d’aménager Gravel Pit Wood (aujourd’hui Highgate Wood) en tant que lotissement, ils avaient rencontré une telle opposition qu’ils avaient fait marche arrière. Dans le même temps, ils ont proposé de vendre Churchyard Bottom Wood au conseil du district urbain de Hornsey pour 25 000 livres sterling, mais c'était trop pour que Hornsey puisse l'élever seul. Le Conseil a déclaré que les personnes vivant à l'extérieur de Hornsey appréciaient également le bois et que d'autres autorités devraient les aider, mais aucune aide n'a été fournie.<br/><br/>Carte montrant les cottages de Muswell Hill qui ont été au centre de la controverse.<br/><br/>Muswell Hill Road vers 1880<br/><br/>Il semble probable que ces trois paires de chalets aient été au centre de la dispute.<br/><br/>Les commissaires ecclésiastiques voulaient amasser des fonds pour son travail d'église en Grande-Bretagne et à l'étranger. Ils considéraient qu’on leur avait donné la terre pour la propogat ion de la religion et si cela signifiait vendre des terres ou des bois, c’était un moindre mal que de restreindre le travail de l’église. Ils avaient donné Gravel Pit Wood au public: à sa place, ils développeraient Churchyard Bottom Wood.<br/><br/>Les fiduciaires des Hornsey Charities voulaient produire un revenu pour aider leurs pauvres, alors ils ont fait une offre aux commissaires. Leur parcelle triangulaire était trop maladroitement formée pour être développée économiquement, mais si les commissaires leur accordaient plus de terres pour en faire un site carré, ils construiraient vingt-cinq villas soignées. En échange, ils permettraient à la Commission de couper deux routes à travers leurs terres afin que les commissaires puissent développer les forêts.<br/><br/>Lorsque cette offre est devenue connue, les gens ont immédiatement réagi avec alarme.<br/><br/>Le 16 décembre 1893, le député Carvell Williams demanda à la Chambre des communes si les commissaires ecclésiastiques avaient consenti à vendre une bande de terre aux Hornsey Charities Trustees à condition qu'une route existante soit élargie à 40 pieds, s'il s'agissait d'un avant-projet de construction et si la Chambre du Parlement aurait la possibilité d'exprimer une opinion.<br/><br/>M. Leveson Gower, un commissaire des États de l'Église, a répondu «Oui» à la première partie.<br/><br/>M. Carvell Williams, "Est-ce que je comprends que c'est l'intention de détruire cette partie de Highgate Woods en construisant dessus?"<br/><br/>Deux jours plus tard, The Star publiait un article digne de tout tabloïd moderne.<br/><br/>L' Étoile<br/>18 décembre 1893<br/><br/>«Le Parlement doit surveiller de près les anciens vandales et complices des commissaires ecclésiastiques, qui sont toujours en train de s'aliéner une parcelle de terre ou de favoriser les constructeurs par opposition au grand public. Les commissaires ne voulaient pas vendre le bois de Churchyard Bottom aux contribuables, mais proposent maintenant de «l'ouvrir» en coupant deux larges routes à travers elle en relation avec l'un de leurs nombreux plans de construction. Quelqu'un ne posera-t-il pas une question au Parlement et ne vérifiera-t-il pas la politique des commissaires?'<br/><br/>Au moment de l'impression, la question avait été posée et la réponse était soit fausse, soit sournoise. D'autres documents ont repris l'histoire. Le Times, dans un long rapport, a déclaré que les commissaires n'étaient pas prêts à s'engager à ce que le Parlement, ou tout autre organisme public, ait la possibilité d'envisager tout projet de construction sur le site du bois.<br/><br/>La situation a mijoté pendant dix-huit mois jusqu'à ce que les commissaires ecclésiastiques ont été contraints d'ouvrir une enquête, qui a commencé à Highgate le 31 mai 1895, présidée par un commissaire ecclésiastique adjoint. L'enquête a produit une foule de lettres de journaux dont c'était le plus important.<br/><br/>The Daily Chronicle, 5 juin 1895<br/><br/>VANDALISM À HIGHGATE<br/><br/>Monsieur -<br/><br/>L'un des plus beaux bouts de forêt de la sous-région de Londres est menacé.Voulez-vous nous aider à conjurer ce qui serait une calamité, non seulement pour le district immédiat, mais pour l'ensemble du nord de Londres densément peuplé? Dans aucune partie de la métropole, le constructeur n'a été plus actif qu'à Crouch End et Hornsey. Les belles prairies d'il y a un an ou deux sont maintenant des maisons et des magasins. Les tas de ballast ont pris la place des ormes majestueux et des châtaignes, et une fois que les villages agréables partagent le sort de Stroud Green, Harringay, Finsbury Park, Highbury et Islington.<br/><br/>---- L'objet est la construction de deux routes de quarante pieds à travers les bois. Nous, dans ce quartier, connaissons la signification des routes de quarante pieds à travers les bois. Cela signifie que les bois sont condamnés. Il y a dix ans, l'agitation a sauvé la forêt sœur de soixante-cinq acres - les Gravel Pit Woods - et personne qui a vu les foules de Bank Holiday affluer sur Archway Road des rues mornes de Holloway, Islington et Clerkenwell, et a vu le plaisir vif des enfants et des fêtes de famille pique-niquer sur l'herbe et parmi les arbres, ne pouvait manquer de réaliser l'immense avantage que la concession des commissaires ecclésiastiques de Londres. ----<br/><br/>--- Les commissaires ecclésiastiques possèdent près d'un tiers de la grande paroisse de Hornsey. Par la dépense libérale de l'argent des contribuables dans l'ouverture des routes et le développement général du district, la valeur de leurs biens a été énormément augmentée, et de cet accroissement immérité, ils tirent chaque année de gros revenus. Certes, les contribuables dont l'argent a ainsi contribué à créer l'immense domaine peuvent s'attendre à un traitement libéral en retour.<br/><br/>Votre obéissance,<br/><br/>Signé par le vicaire de St James, Muswell Hill, le ministre de la chapelle du parc, Crouch End, un avocat vivant à Onslow Gardens et trois membres du conseil de district.<br/><br/>C'était un coup de feu à travers les arcs des commissaires ecclésiastiques. Leurs propres chefs religieux et le conseil de district, tous en armes disant en effet que l'église était trop riche et devrait être charitable, pas avide. L’inclusion des deux membres du clergé était un geste astucieux. Rappelez-vous que c’était encore au plus fort de la controverse de Darwin. Darwin avait divisé la croyance dans les enseignements de l'Église et beaucoup de gens auraient ressenti le pouvoir de l'Église de ce seul point de vue. L'Église n'était pas aussi sûre qu'elle prétendait l'être.<br/><br/>The Evening News, 7 Juin 1895 dit:<br/><br/>"Si l'on ne s'attaque pas tout de suite aux Communosioners ecclésiastiques, la pieuvre du bâtiment aura une emprise sur le bois qui sera très difficile à desserrer plus tard, ---. Par conséquent, il appartient aux Londoniens d'être debout et de faire s'ils veulent sauver l'un de leurs plus beaux morceaux de paysage rustique. L'enquête publique est ajournée à jeudi prochain, et avant cela, il faut faire quelque chose pour convaincre les commissaires que les citoyens de Londres ne toléreront pas la confiscation de l'un de leurs terrains de jeux préférés.<br/><br/>Une lettre dans le Daily Chronicle le lendemain dit:<br/><br/>.... Ce fut avec un grand soulagement que les habitants, il y a une dizaine d’années, apprirent que l’achat du bois supérieur avait été effectué ; et comme cela a été une bénédiction délicieuse, tous ceux qui les visitèrent peuvent en témoigner, mais tous ceux qui s’efforçaient de sauver ces bois supérieurs, qui se trouvent du côté ouest de la route de Muswell Hill, sentaient que leur victoire était incomplète tant que les soixante acres du côté est restaient en danger. Peut-on douter de ce que serait l’effet si le bois de fond de la cour de l’église était remplacé par des rangées de petites villas, chacune envoyant sa contribution de fumée et de suie? Quelqu'un peut-il douter, aussi, de la différence sérieuse que cela ferait au cadre pittoresque des bois achetés si une ligne de nouvelles maisons fixes devait être montée juste en face de leur façade feuillue?<br/><br/>Cela exprimait les opinions de nombreuses personnes. En fait, le bois de la fosse de gravier, que l'écrivain appelle le « bois supérieur », n'avait pas été acheté, mais donné au district par la Commission ecclésiastique, un point qu'ils devaient répéter à maintes reprises au fil des ans, mais la plupart des gens l'ignoraient. La Commission n'allait pas donner un deuxième bois quoi qu'on dise, et a tenu cette position jusqu'au bout.<br/><br/>H.S.Chamberlain, de 5 Cranley Gardens, dans une lettre au Times datée du 8 juin 1895, a exhorté à acheter.<br/><br/>Je sais qu'il est courant de parler durement des commissaires ecclésiastiques, mais en tant que fiduciaires d'un fonds, ils sont tenus de l'administrer au plus grand avantage, et par conséquent, si quelque chose doit être fait pour sauver la démolition du bois, il me semble que cela ne peut être effectué que par l'achat de la propriété de la part des marchands, que je sais, je suis pleinement vivant à la protection des petits espaces libres pour les gens.<br/><br/>(Cela fait référence aux Crouch End Playing Fields qui avaient été sécurisés quelques années plus tard.)<br/><br/>En tant que président de l'Association conservatrice de Muswell Hill, je suis constamment en contact avec les habitants, et je peux affirmer sans risque que chaque personne résidant dans le quartier ferait n'importe quoi pour préserver.<br/><br/>(Tout ce qu'il voulait personnellement, c'était un revenu de charité pour subvenir aux besoins de ses pauvres gens. Il exigeait son acre de terre - ce qui n'était pas très sûr - il croyait que les commissaires avaient l'assurance que le bois n'était pas en danger.)<br/><br/>Muswell Hill Road était l'un des meilleurs de Hornsey et resterait tout aussi belle, maisons ou pas de maisons.<br/><br/>(et puis vint le grand fleurissement rhétorique.)<br/><br/>Les pauvres doivent-ils souffrir à cause des objections sentimentales et du cri hystérique du loup que viennent d'élever vos correspondants ? Un acre d’arrière-pays ajouté à la propriété de charité ne ferait aucune différence appréciable sur la terre restante, tandis que le profit qui en résulterait aiderait beaucoup de pauvres personnes âgées et méritantes dans leurs années de déclin et nous permettrait de remettre à nos successeurs une propriété qui, dans un avenir lointain, serait d’une grande valeur dans la prestation d’une aide charitable aux pauvres méritants de la paroisse de Hornsey.<br/><br/>En lisant sa lettre, on sent l'hystérie très près de la surface. Pourquoi pensait-il que les commissaires voulaient construire une route? Pourquoi devraient-ils dépenser tout cet argent sinon pour construire des maisons? Il ne sembla jamais se rendre compte que pour un acre de terre tout le bois serait perdu, mais il avait été avec le problème pendant longtemps. Il était la personne à qui les commissaires avaient fait l’offre de vente pour 25 000 ans auparavant et c’est son nom qui est honoré sur une plaque sur Crouch End Clock Tower pour avoir sauvé le bois, mais sa confiance dans les commissaires ecclésiastiques semble naïve. C’est triste qu’à l’enquête, il ait été jeté comme le diable.<br/><br/>L'enquête s'est poursuivie<br/><br/>L'ajournement s'ouvre à Highgate le 15 juin 1895. Attendant une grande réunion, la salle du conseil est complètement changée. Les tables habituelles sont enlevées et la salle est remplie de chaises. À sept heures et demie, la salle était bondée, les gens se bousculaient pour trouver des sièges.<br/><br/>M. Murray, le commissaire, a déclaré que l'enquête était vraiment simple: Hornsey Parochial Charities souhaitait acheter un terrain attenant à sa propriété de bienfaisance à l'arrière. La question était de savoir si la Charity Commission, qui contrôlait tous les organismes de bienfaisance, avait assez de pouvoir pour les arrêter. Les commissaires de l'Église étaient prêts à vendre le terrain à des conditions très favorables et les revenus de la charité seraient très considérablement augmentés.<br/><br/>Il y avait trois catégories d’objections.<br/><br/>Le Trust d'origine était dans le but de fournir des chalets pour les pauvres, mais les administrateurs proposaient de construire des villas qui seraient trop chères pour les pauvres. Cependant, les administrateurs avaient le pouvoir de modifier les termes du Trust, afin qu’ils puissent construire des villas s’ils pensaient que les pauvres en bénéficieraient à la fin. Les pauvres eux-mêmes pouvaient objecter, mais des dispositions libérales leur avaient déjà été promises. La troisième objection concernait le côté esthétique et public de la question. Il a pris de ce qu'il avait lu que la Commission de la charité devrait intervenir pour empêcher les commissaires ecclésiastiques d'exercer leur propre discrétion dans le traitement de leur propre propriété.<br/><br/>L'enquête a discuté de points délicats, mais les orateurs n'ont cessé de revenir sur le problème majeur de la prévention de toute destruction du bois. Le greffier de la Vestry d'Islington, représentant 300 000 personnes, a protesté officiellement contre le fait que n'importe quelle partie du bois, si précieuse pour les habitants d'Islington et de Hornsey, soit utilisée à des fins privées. M. Wilfred White a déclaré que si les commissaires leur donnaient du temps, ils seraient en mesure de collecter les fonds pour indemniser les fiduciaires.<br/><br/>M. Beaumont a dit qu'ils ne voulaient pas de villas, ils voulaient des chalets pour les pauvres qui étaient chassés du district. D’autres disaient qu’il n’y avait pas d’argent pour construire des chalets pour remplacer les actuels délabrés, mais que les villas seraient une proposition économique. D’autres répondaient qu’il y avait une vingtaine de villas à louer à Highgate. Le bois était sacré. S'en tenir à la question du bois.<br/><br/>Le Dr Fletcher a déclaré que le cri des travailleurs était qu'il n'y avait nulle part où aller. Les travailleurs sont venus à lui avec le cri: "Nous sommes chassés de Highgate et obligés d'aller à Highgate New Town." Si la façade de la route de Muswell Hill était vendue, il ne faisait aucun doute que les routes pourraient être coupées à travers les bois en direction de Hornsey, mais si les commissaires ne pouvaient pas obtenir les terres de la Commission caritative, ils ne pourraient pas couper la route.<br/><br/>Il était très sûr que les chalets pourraient être mis en état de réparation. Il a été demandé par les pauvres, par la police et par un certain nombre de classes ouvrières de représenter ces deux points, que le logement de chalet était très nécessaire à Highgate et que si elles une fois permis la terre à vendre, il n'y avait pas de dire où la main du constructeur serait resté.<br/><br/>(Acclamations fortes et prolongées).<br/><br/>De nombreuses autres personnes ont pris la parole et le conseiller a résumé en disant qu'il considérait que l'opinion dominante était en faveur du maintien des chalets, mais que la réunion ne devrait tirer aucune conclusion de ce qu'il avait dit (grossissements).<br/><br/>D’autres ont dit que les administrateurs de la charité avaient échoué dans leurs fonctions en laissant les chalets tomber en ruine.<br/><br/>M. H.R. Williams, le fiduciaire qui avait écrit au journal plus tôt, a déclaré qu'il avait la meilleure autorité pour que les commissaires de l'Église ne fassent aucune route et qu'ils ne bénéficieraient pas d'un iota des actions des commissaires de la charité. D'autres étaient beaucoup moins confiants et la réunion a fermé après près de trois heures.<br/><br/>Nous sommes confrontés au fait que dans Highgate et Muswell Hill, il y a un certain nombre de personnes qui veulent le Churchyard Bottom Wood et ne seront pas heureux jusqu'à ce qu'ils l'aient - alors que personne ne semble prêt à dépenser un petthing pour le payer. Tout le monde dit que ce serait une bonne chose d'avoir le bois comme espace ouvert, mais tout le monde pense que c'est le devoir de quelqu'un d'autre d'en faire un. La Islington Vestry a "résolu" sur le sujet, mais la Islington Vestry n'offre pas un penny pour l'achat. Il n'y a pas de problème plus difficile à résoudre pour la communauté ou l'individu que de savoir comment prendre possession des biens d'autrui sans les payer.<br/><br/>C’est en effet le problème, car Churchyard Bottom Wood fait l’objet d’intenses débats locaux et nationaux. Un comité mixte est formé pour recueillir des fonds afin de sauver le bois. Le 20 novembre 1896, C.F. Cory-Wright, trésorier, a écrit à The Standard, un quotidien de l’époque, pour demander de l’aide. Il a rappelé à tout le monde le danger de perdre le bois et a dit qu’il ne pouvait être sauvé qu’en l’achetant. Les commissaires de l'Église se vendraient 25 000 livres et un supplément (5 000 seraient nécessaires pour les clôtures et le drainage, ce qui représentait un total de 30 000 livres, ce qui était trop pour le Conseil Hornsey à recueillir, mais ils avaient déjà voté 10 000 livres pour le total. Les bois étant d’une valeur inestimable pour tout le nord de Londres, il fit appel aux organismes publics et aux particuliers pour qu’ils lèvent les 20 000 livres restantes, et il avertit que la présente offre des commissaires de l’Église n’était ouverte que jusqu’à la fin de 1898. Après cela, les constructeurs emménagèrent.<br/><br/>L'appel a été chaleureusement accueilli par la presse. Un projet de loi privé a été rapidement adopté par le Parlement et la Highgate Woods Preservation Act, 1897, est devenue loi. Le Conunittee avait maintenant le droit de faire de la publicité pour des contributions à l'achat du bois et à sa préservation.<br/><br/>En assez peu de temps, la quasi-totalité de l'argent a été collectée, mais les derniers milliers se sont révélés très difficiles à lever et le délai fixé par les commissaires n'est plus que de quelques semaines. M. Cory-Wright a écrit plaidant pour plus de temps, mais n'a été accordé que trois mois, puis seulement si les intérêts à 4 pour cent ont été payés pour la période supplémentaire sur la totalité de la somme. En fin de compte, le conseil du comté de Londres, qui avait initialement offert 2 500 livres sterling, en a fait jusqu'à 5 000 livres sterling et le total a été atteint, mais c'était une chose à court terme.<br/><br/>Le Conseil a décidé de renommer le bois comme «bois de la reine» en l'honneur du jubilé de diamant de la reine Victoria et Hornsey a fait une belle démonstration de bunting lorsque la duchesse d'Albany a officiellement déclaré le bois ouvert «pour l'usage libre du public pour toujours».<br/><br/>Bien que la campagne pour sauver Churchyard Bottom Wood ait été menée et dirigée par des gens locaux qui se passionnaient pour ce morceau de forêt particulier, ils ont fait appel à l’aide et à l’expérience d’un vaste réseau de personnes, dont certaines avaient travaillé ensemble sur des campagnes similaires pendant plus de trente ans. Le Comité a lancé un appel, imprimé sur du papier de très bonne qualité et portant quelques noms célèbres.<br/><br/>Les questions des espaces ouverts et de la santé publique étaient des sujets majeurs de la vision victorienne.<br/><br/>Le mouvement Open Spaces<br/><br/>Octavia Hill, le grand réformateur du logement, qui avait commencé avec trois vieilles maisons à Marylebone, achetées pour elle par Jolm Ruskin, était rapidement devenu un expert sur le logement des personnes pauvres dans les conditions les plus saines possibles. Sa façon était d'acheter des baux et ensuite abattre certaines des maisons bondées afin d'apporter de la lumière et de l'air au reste, croyant que l'air frais et la lumière du soleil étaient la seule façon de sauver les pauvres de la fièvre putride. Elle avait appris cela quand elle était enfant de son grand-père, Southwood Smith, qui a développé ses théories à l'hôpital Fever à King's Cross.<br/><br/>Il avait construit les premiers logements industriels pour les pauvres et avait prouvé statistiquement qu'un bon air et un drainage décent sauvaient des vies. Gibson Gardens, à Northwold Road, est un résultat direct des idées de Southwood Smith.<br/><br/>L’importance de l’air libre<br/><br/>Les espaces ouverts et la possibilité de respirer de l'air pur étaient essentiels pour les personnes vivant dans une ou deux pièces bondées. Octavia Hill a pris ses charges des bidonvilles de Lisson Grove, jusqu'à l'avenue Fitzjohn à Hampstead Heath. Elle aimait tellement les champs de l'avenue Fitzjohn qu'elle a essayé de les acheter comme un parc public. Ils devaient coûter 10 000 euros et dans les trois semaines d'août, 8 500 euros avaient été collectés. Il ne lui fallait que la fin des vacances d’été et le retour des vacances des amis sympathiques et les 1 500 euros supplémentaires auraient été levés, mais les propriétaires ont soudainement retiré leur offre. Malgré tous les plaidoyers, les champs étaient couverts de grandes maisons.<br/><br/>C'est à partir de là que s'est développée la campagne pour sauver la Colline du Parlement, le prochain espace ouvert au nord de Lisson Grove, en achetant des champs sur le chemin des constructeurs pour créer un cordon sanitaire permanent contre les briques en progression. La campagne des Champs de la Colline du Parlement a connu un tel succès que le projet de loi sur la santé de Hampstead a été adopté et qu'il y a eu de l'argent provenant de l'appel. Octavia Hill s’intéressait depuis des années à la protection de zones comme Church Bottom Wood, elle était donc une alliée naturelle dans la lutte pour sauver le bois.<br/><br/>La Commons Preservation Society connaissait également ce genre d’agitation et de collecte d’argent. Ils avaient démoli les clôtures lorsque les seigneurs du manoir avaient fermé des parcelles de terre commune, menant des batailles à la fois légales et illégales contre la privatisation arrogante des terres traditionnellement libres. Robert Hunter, leur avocat honoraire à partir de 1868, a toujours été soucieux de sécuriser les espaces ouverts, grands ou petits, pour le public. Lui, maintenant Sir Robert Hunter, est devenu le président de l'appel de fond de l'Église. Le président de la Commons Preservation Society était M. Shaw-Lefevre, député (plus tard Lord Eversley), qui joua un rôle important dans cette campagne et dans d’autres à la Chambre des communes.<br/><br/>Au même moment, Octavia Hill faisait campagne pour un projet de loi sur les sépultures.<br/><br/>Les cours d’église de la ville étaient devenues si remplies et constituaient un danger si grave pour la santé, en contaminant les puits d’où les gens puisaient leur eau potable, que les sépultures de la ville n’étaient plus autorisées. Le cimetière d’Abney Park était l’un d’entre eux, puis il y a eu un mouvement pour enlever les pierres tombales jusqu’aux limites des cimetières de la vieille ville, ré-intercaler les corps ailleurs et transformer les cimetières en jardins et espaces ouverts, au lieu de construire sur eux. Cette terre au centre de Londres était très précieuse et les spéculateurs étaient avides de l'obtenir: même les Quakers avaient construit sur une de leurs cimetières et menaçaient de le faire à nouveau en construisant sur Bunhill Fields. Octavia Hill avait un réseau d'alliés dans une douzaine de domaines, donc son aide pour sauver le bois de fond de l'église a dû être inestimable.<br/><br/>La Metropolitan Gardens Society, créée en 1882, avait aménagé environ deux cents petits jardins dans les centres-villes en 1890, puis les a remis aux autorités locales, de sorte que leur soutien à l’appel de Churchyard Bottom Wood a été assuré dès le début.<br/><br/>La société Kyrle est maintenant oubliée, mais à son époque a eu une grande influence sur la législation de l'urbanisme et de l'espace ouvert. La Société avait été créée vers 1875 pour «la diffusion de la beauté», afin d'apporter de la couleur et de l'intérêt dans la vie des personnes vivant dans un environnement terne et terne. Couleur vive aux murs et à la décoration, bon chant, espaces ouverts, nature, littérature et art. Il y avait une section de décoration pour laquelle William Morris donnait des conférences, une section de musique pour promouvoir les chœurs et les soirées joyeuses pour les gens dans les bâtiments scolaires locaux et une section de littérature. La Société fait régulièrement appel par lettres dans le Times aux « classes les plus riches » pour que des livres et des périodiques soient distribués aux clubs de garçons et de filles, aux aumôneries et ailleurs. Le nom même de «Kyrle» vient de l'homme de Ross du pape, le philanthrope qui a donné son lieu de naissance au peuple comme un parc public. |
| With Thanksgiving around the corner, here are some festive file folder games we made for the girls. Both Thanksgiving games focus on math skills. And I'm grateful once again to my husband, Ed, for making all the clipart for me.<br/><br/>Thanksgiving Pattern Making<br/><br/>Like the name says, this game is about making patterns. Little ones just learning about patterns, can simply match the pictures onto the pattern strips, while others can continue the pattern with the picture cards on the blank strips.<br/><br/>To make the file folder, you want to cut out the grid of pictures to make the card pieces. I recommend laminating them to help them last longer. Then glue the pattern strips down on the file folder.<br/><br/>I wanted to have the blank pattern strips too so that the girls could see where to continue the pattern and how many to lay out. I attached them to the side of the folder using tape so that they could fold in to pack up the game and extend to layout the pattern.<br/><br/>I also added an extra blank one so that the girls could make their own pattern as well.<br/><br/>Turkey Number Game<br/><br/>In this game the girls add the feathers to the turkey body while practicing counting and number recognition. I used the colorless feathers to act as a guide for where to add the feathers and so that the girls could match the numbers. And be sure when gluing down the turkey body you only glue in the center so that the wing pieces can slide under the body.<br/><br/>Once all the feathers are laid out, we practice some simple arithmetic, such as taking away three feathers and seeing how many are left then adding two back to see what it equals.<br/><br/>In addition to black and white wings, we also included a colorless turkey in case you want to have the little ones color their own set. Instead of a file folder game you can turn this into a craft, coloring the pieces, cutting them out, and gluing them together.<br/><br/>Another option is to use the pieces to make a felt board story. We sometimes sing a turkey version of 10 Little Indians:<br/><br/>Like this:<br/><br/>Who Am I?<br/><br/>I think this is where I'm suppose to say something witty about myself. Oh well. I'm a stay-at-home mom to three awesome kids--our twin daughters who are seven now and a two-year-old son who is full of energy. In my pre-children life I was a teacher and I now homeschool our children. I'm also married to Ed, who is currently serving in the Air Force, and is the love of my life (it'd be awkward if he wasn't). Our family is big on books, crafts, and having fun together. I just thought I would share our activities in my own little corner of the internet.<br/><br/>Zoe appears to have it all--rich, handsome husband, easy New York life--but she made mistakes in her past and those mistakes are coming back up in her new life. I found myself on the edge of my seat for most of the book and was surprised...<br/><br/>I loved this book, I love the story, and I am grateful Margot Shetterly brought it to light. My only complaint was that I wished she discussed Katherine Johnson's role in the later missions a bit more but I guess the story had to end som...<br/><br/>I wanted to like this book and I did throughout most of it. Dana finds out her estranged husband and his girlfriend are found dead in the New Mexico desert. I was immediately drawn in by her character and the story. I really enjoyed seei... | Avec Thanksgiving au coin de la rue, voici quelques jeux de dossiers festifs que nous avons faits pour les filles. Les deux jeux de Thanksgiving se concentrent sur les compétences en mathématiques. Et je suis reconnaissant encore une fois à mon mari, Ed, d'avoir fait tous les cliparts pour moi.<br/><br/>Thanksgiving Pattern Making<br/><br/>Comme son nom l'indique, ce jeu consiste à créer des motifs. Les petits qui apprennent à connaître les motifs peuvent simplement faire correspondre les images aux bandes de motifs, tandis que d'autres peuvent continuer le motif avec les cartes sur les bandes vierges.<br/><br/>Pour faire le dossier de fichier, vous voulez découper la grille d'images pour faire les morceaux de carte. Je recommande de les laminer pour les aider à durer plus longtemps. Ensuite, collez les bandes de motif vers le bas sur le dossier de fichier.<br/><br/>Je voulais aussi avoir les bandes de motif vierges pour que les filles puissent voir où continuer le motif et combien d'espacer. Je les ai attachés sur le côté du dossier à l'aide d'une bande afin qu'ils puissent se plier pour emballer le jeu et s'étendre pour mettre en page le motif.<br/><br/>J'ai également ajouté un blanc supplémentaire pour que les filles puissent faire leur propre modèle ainsi.<br/><br/>Turquie numéro jeu<br/><br/>Dans ce jeu, les filles ajoutent les plumes au corps de la dinde tout en pratiquant le comptage et la reconnaissance des nombres. J'ai utilisé les plumes incolores pour servir de guide pour savoir où ajouter les plumes et pour que les filles puissent correspondre aux chiffres. Et assurez-vous que lorsque vous collez le corps de dinde, vous ne collez que le centre pour que les ailes puissent glisser sous le corps.<br/><br/>Une fois que toutes les plumes sont disposées, nous pratiquons une arithmétique simple, comme enlever trois plumes et voir combien il en reste, puis en ajouter deux pour voir ce qu'il équivaut.<br/><br/>En plus des ailes noires et blanches, nous avons également inclus une dinde incolore au cas où vous voudriez que les petits colorent leur propre ensemble. Au lieu d'un jeu de dossiers, vous pouvez transformer cela en un métier, colorier les pièces, les découper et les coller ensemble.<br/><br/>Une autre option est d'utiliser les morceaux pour faire une histoire de planche de feutre. Nous chantons parfois une version de dinde de 10 petits Indiens:<br/><br/>Comme ceci :<br/><br/>Qui suis-je ?<br/><br/>Je pense que c'est là que je suis supposé dire quelque chose d'esprit à propos de moi-même. Oh bien. Je suis une mère au foyer pour trois enfants géniaux - nos filles jumelles qui ont sept ans maintenant et un fils de deux ans qui est plein d'énergie. Dans ma vie d'enfant, j'étais professeur et j'ai maintenant fait l'école à la maison avec nos enfants. Je suis aussi marié à Ed, qui sert actuellement dans l'armée de l'air et qui est l'amour de ma vie (ce serait gênant s'il ne l'était pas). Notre famille est grande sur les livres, l'artisanat, et s'amuser ensemble. Je pensais juste que je partagerais nos activités dans mon propre petit coin de l'Internet.<br/><br/>Zoe semble avoir tout - riche, beau mari, la vie facile à New York - mais elle a fait des erreurs dans son passé et ces erreurs reviennent dans sa nouvelle vie. Je me suis retrouvé sur le bord de mon siège pour la plupart du livre et a été surpris...<br/><br/>J'ai adoré ce livre, j'adore l'histoire, et je suis reconnaissant à Margot Shetterly de l'avoir mis au jour. Mon seul reproche était que j'aurais souhaité qu'elle discute un peu plus du rôle de Katherine Johnson dans les missions ultérieures, mais je suppose que l'histoire devait se terminer...<br/><br/>Je voulais aimer ce livre et je l'ai fait tout au long de la majeure partie de celui-ci. Dana découvre que son mari et sa petite amie sont retrouvés morts dans le désert du Nouveau-Mexique. J'ai immédiatement été attiré par son personnage et l'histoire. J'ai vraiment apprécié seei... |
| Alcohol use by persons under age 21 has been identified as a major public health problem. Studies note that it increases the risks for disability, and may be detrimental to the developing brain. Minors who drink are more likely to commit suicide, break the law, or be victims of violence. Alcohol is implicated in nearly one-third of youth traffic fatalities. The total annual cost of underage drinking is estimated at $62 billion. While most laws intended to prevent underage drinking are passed at the state level, there has been legislative activity and interest at the federal level to support states' efforts to curb the problem. This report describes the extent of underage alcohol use, recent legislative activity on this issue, and various policy implications. It will be updated as new data become available. | La consommation d'alcool par les personnes de moins de 21 ans a été identifiée comme un problème de santé publique majeur. Des études notent qu'elle augmente les risques d'invalidité et peut être préjudiciable au cerveau en développement. Les mineurs qui boivent sont plus susceptibles de se suicider, d’enfreindre la loi ou d’être victimes de violence. L’alcool est impliqué dans près d’un tiers des accidents mortels de la route chez les jeunes. Le coût annuel total de la consommation d’alcool chez les mineurs est estimé à 62 milliards de dollars. Alors que la plupart des lois visant à prévenir la consommation d'alcool chez les mineurs sont adoptées au niveau des États, il y a eu une activité législative et un intérêt au niveau fédéral pour soutenir les efforts des États pour freiner le problème. Le présent rapport décrit l'ampleur de la consommation d'alcool chez les mineurs, les récentes activités législatives à cet égard et les diverses répercussions sur les politiques, et il sera mis à jour à mesure que de nouvelles données seront disponibles. |
| Tag Archives: real food<br/><br/>Last week I wrote about the Nordic Food Manifesto, and how Denmark created a strong "real food" culture largely from an intentional effort led by Claus Meyer. It wasn't political lobbying or public petitioning that resulted in food reform, but rather a grassroots effort led by citizens with the power to actually implement and follow-through with change.<br/><br/>I ended the post alluding to one question: Why is it so hard for us to do this ourselves, as individuals? If an entire country can implement and spread a common view towards food, why can't we?<br/><br/>There's nothing really stopping us from mimicking Denmark's success. The problem is, we're inundated with so many messages about what we should be eating, and how we should be living, it's hard to know where to start. So rather than following successful frameworks that have been shown to work (like the Nordic Food Manifesto), most people jump from diet craze to diet craze, trying to find the "right way to eat."<br/><br/>But how did Claus Meyer succeed? What was the secret sauce that helped the Manifesto take hold? And is it reasonable to think we can apply those lessons to our own lives?

Ce n’est pas le lobbying politique ou les pétitions publiques qui ont abouti à une réforme alimentaire, mais plutôt un effort populaire mené par des citoyens ayant le pouvoir de mettre en œuvre et de suivre le changement.<br/><br/>J'ai terminé le post en faisant allusion à une question: pourquoi est-il si difficile pour nous de le faire nous-mêmes, en tant qu'individus? Si un pays entier peut mettre en œuvre et diffuser une vision commune de la nourriture, pourquoi ne le pouvons-nous pas?<br/><br/>Il n'y a rien qui nous empêche vraiment d'imiter le succès du Danemark. Le problème est que nous sommes inondés de tant de messages sur ce que nous devrions manger, et comment nous devrions vivre, il est difficile de savoir par où commencer. Ainsi, plutôt que de suivre des cadres réussis qui se sont révélés efficaces (comme le Nordic Food Manifesto), la plupart des gens passent de l'engouement pour l'alimentation à l'engouement pour l'alimentation, en essayant de trouver la «bonne façon de manger».<br/><br/>Mais comment Claus Meyer a-t-il réussi? Quelle a été la sauce secrète qui a aidé le Manifeste à s'imposer?
