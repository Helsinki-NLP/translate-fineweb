| Smith Chuck - Through the Bible C2000 SeriesShall we turn to the book of Acts, chapter one, as we begin our study of the early church.<br/>Luke, the author of the book of Acts, a companion of Paul the apostle, who was author also of the Gospel According to Luke, wrote these two treatises to a friend, Theophilus. Theophilus is a Greek name. It's a name that has a beautiful meaning. The name means lover of God. There are some who believe that it was not a man at all, but that the gospel and the book of Acts were addressed to the lovers of God, whoever you may be. There are other traditions that say that Theophilus was actually Luke's master. That in those days physicians were slaves, usually the slave of a wealthy patron. So that Luke's master was Theophilus, and he released Luke to be with Paul on the missionary journeys. Thus, Luke is writing back to his former master. This is an early tradition of the church, but it is, of course, impossible to prove, like so many of the traditions.<br/>There are also those who believe that when Paul was in Troas and he received a vision of a man calling unto him saying, "Come over to Macedonia and help us," that that man in Paul's vision was none other than Luke. For the first one that Paul really met when he came to Macedonia was Luke. And as we are in the book of Acts, you will find that when we get to that portion of the book of Acts, Luke begins to write more in the first person rather than the third person. So it is, evidently, at this particular point in the Acts of the Apostles that Luke became a companion of Paul and began to journey with him. He began to use the pronouns "we" and "us" instead of "they" and "them." This is, no doubt, where Luke became a participant and an eyewitness of those things that were happening from this point on. We will bring this out to you when we get to that point.<br/>He begins the Acts of the Apostles by tying it with the Gospel According to Luke. It is interesting that the very last thing that Luke records in his gospel is the very first thing he records in the Acts of the Apostles. We find the gospel of Luke closing as Jesus is telling His disciples to wait in Jerusalem until they be endued with power from on high. And then Jesus ascended up into heaven, and so he closes the gospel. In opening the Acts of the Apostles, he writes,<br/>The former treatise [that is, the Gospel According to Luke,] have I written unto you, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and teach ( Act 1:1 ),<br/>The key word is began. The Gospel According to Luke is not the full story of the ministry of Jesus Christ. It is only the beginning of the ministry of Jesus Christ. Jesus continues to minister to the needs of people. Jesus continues to heal the sick. Jesus continues to raise the dead. Jesus continues to minister His love and His gospel to the world, only now He is ministering through those disciples who have been anointed with His Holy Spirit. But the ministry of Christ is continuing; basically, is the premise that Luke takes in the Acts of the Apostles. The former treatise of all that Jesus began, both to do and to teach.<br/>Now because of that, the Acts of the Apostles is an unfinished book: in that the Lord today continues to work through the lives of those who have dedicated themselves to be the instruments of God. To be led and guided and anointed by His Holy Spirit, to continue the ministry of Jesus in the world today. Now God has ordained that His work should be accomplished through human instruments. I do not say that it must be accomplished. God can use angelic beings for His work, and there will come a time, during the book of Revelation when God will use angels to proclaim His gospel to people all over the world. Revelation, chapter 14, "The first angel flying through the midst of heaven having the everlasting gospel" ( Rev 14:6 ). But at the present time, God has chosen to use human instruments. As imperfect as they may be, yet that's what God has ordained to use. The exciting thing about that is, God will use me and God will use you. So many times, we're begging off, "O Lord, I can't speak. I've never been able to speak before or even now, Lord." As Moses tried to beg off the call of God. Jeremiah said, "Lord, I'm just a kid; no one's going to listen to me." And we all have our excuses why we can't be used. Don't we? We all know the reasons why God couldn't use us.<br/>One time, as the Lord was calling a prophet to do His work, he said, "Lord, send whoever you want." The Lord said, "Hey, I've called you." "Lord, good idea; send whoever you want." So often we're in that position, "Lord, send by the hand of whomsoever you will, anybody but me Lord." And yet, God has ordained to use us.<br/>Now, each of us can show our own imperfections. Each of us can point out our own inabilities, and all of us can find an excuse why God wouldn't want to use me. But yet, God has chosen to use you. That through your life He might reveal Himself to a needy world. You wonder when God has such instruments to use how He ever got the job done, don't you?<br/>Until the day in which he was taken up, after that he through the Holy Spirit had given commandments to the apostles whom he had chosen ( Act 1:2 ):<br/>That is what he ended the Gospel of Luke with. The day that Jesus was taken up, after He had told the apostles to wait for the endowment of power.<br/>To whom he also [that is the apostles he also] showed himself alive to them after his passion [or death] by many infallible proofs ( Act 1:3 ),<br/>It is difficult to deny the fact of the resurrection of Jesus Christ. I was amused, as well as annoyed and irritated, by an article I read in the Santa Ana Register this last Saturday. Of the creation science and evolutionary theories being presented in the county schools. How that, this one professor said that he teaches a science class, and thus, they deal only in facts, and that they don't have any place for theories. Because science is based upon fact and creation is based upon religious superstitions. It takes a lot of faith to believe the religious theories. When you are dealing with facts, you can just accept them. I thought, "Very interesting in that science class, they taught me it was a fact that the world was four billion years old. Now today they are teaching it's a fact that the world is twelve billion years old. And it wasn't that long ago that I went to school."<br/>It's interesting that the Bible has never needed to be revised or updated to meet the current data that men have discovered. And yet, if you would take my high school science textbooks today and try to teach a science class from them, you would find that many of the things that were taught as scientific fact when I was in high school are no longer recognized as scientific fact. The simple cell protoplasm is no longer a simple cell, but extremely complex. If there is any fact that can be attested to in history it is the fact of the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.<br/>We have a jurisprudence system that is based upon the testimony of witnesses. If a man is accused of a crime and there are people who witnessed that crime while it was being committed, and they are brought to the standard, and they swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help them God. And in their questioning they affirm that, "I saw that man in the bank on May twenty-third. I saw him pull out a gun from his coat. I heard him demand that all of the money be given to him. I saw him as he left the bank. I saw him as the officer apprehended him outside." And if you can get three or four witnesses to point to that man and will keep their testimony under cross-examination, that man is judged to be guilty. He is the one who did it. We have two or three witnesses that are testifying the same story about that man, and it is accepted as fact that he is the one who perpetrated the crime and is guilty. You've got witnesses who have sworn to tell the truth that are verifying.<br/>After the death of Jesus, when He rose again, He appeared unto many different people who gave sworn testimony that they saw Him. That they talked to Him, that He appeared to them in various places under different circumstances. And for a period of forty days was visiting with them. And at one time, up to as many as five hundred people who were gathered at one place, He appeared. It's difficult to just cast aside or deny the witness of these people. To do so is to discredit our whole jurisprudence system. But not only that, these men who testified that they saw the risen Lord, that they talked to Him, that they ate with Him, they, all of them, with the exception of one, met violent deaths at the hands of other people because of their affirming that the story they told was true. You talk about witnesses sworn to tell the truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth. If a person's life was threatened because of that witness, and it was a lie, at least one them would've broken under the pressure. They would've confessed to the entire hoax. "He showed Himself alive after His passion by many infallible proofs."<br/>being seen of them for forty days, speaking to them of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God ( Act 1:3 ):<br/>Sometimes we fault the disciples because of their questions of the timing of the kingdom of God. Let it be remembered that the kingdom of God was the favorite subject of Jesus Christ. He was always talking about the kingdom of God, and it is a great hope that He was planting into the hearts of all men. Things are not always going to continue corrupted as they are. The world is not going to go forever under the power of darkness, under the bondage of evil. God is going to one day establish His kingdom upon the earth. A kingdom of righteous joy and peace. "Jesus shall reign, where ere the sun doth her successive journeys run. And His kingdom will extend from shore to shore." And that day will be the most glorious day the world has ever seen, as sickness and suffering and pain will be abolished in His kingdom. As sin and greed and these things that have made the world such an intolerable place will be abolished in His kingdom. The godless commercialism, the exploitation of man, all of these things abolished in His glorious kingdom when He reigns. No wonder the disciples were anxious to get it on. I'm anxious to get it on; I'm anxious for His kingdom to come. And Jesus told us when we pray, the first petition is, "Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven" ( Mat 6:10 ). This is the right kind of a desire that we should all have. I desire the kingdom of God. And so He was talking to them, during this forty-day period, of the kingdom.<br/>And, being assembled together with them, he commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which, saith he, you have heard of me ( Act 1:4 ).<br/>He said, "Now look, wait here in Jerusalem until you receive the promise of the Father." This promise that He is referring to is, no doubt, the promise in Joel where the Lord promised, "And it shall come to pass in the later days, saith the Lord, that I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and daughters will prophesy, and your young men shall dream dreams, your old men shall see visions: and upon my servants and my handmaidens shall I pour out my Spirit, saith the Lord" ( Joe 2:28-29 ). The promise of the Father: the day is going to come when God is going to pour out His Spirit upon all flesh, all of the believers. They will, each one, receive that dynamic from God.<br/>For John [He said,] truly baptized with water; but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now ( Act 1:5 ).<br/>The idea of baptism was that of emersion, the bapteedzo. John baptized with water, submerged the people in water, "you're going to be submerged in the Holy Spirit in not many days."<br/>Now when they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, will you at this time restore the kingdom to Israel? ( Act 1:6 )<br/>"When is it going to be, Lord? When's the time for this restoration?" And Jesus is talking to them now, not about the kingdom, but about the power that they're going to receive for service. And so He brushes aside their question.<br/>Saying unto them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father has put in his own power ( Act 1:7 ).<br/>"It's not for you to know." They lived constantly in the anticipation of the immediate setting up of the kingdom. During the entire lifetime of Jesus, they were expecting Him at any moment to go into the phone booth and come out as the savior of the world. Shazzam! Showing His power and overthrowing the governments of the world, establishing God's kingdom upon the earth. And they were waiting daily for this change to transpire. And whenever Jesus would talk about going to Jerusalem, being turned over into the hands of sinful man, and then being crucified, "Oh, oh no, Lord. No, no you don't understand the kingdom, Lord. Be that far from Thee." When Jesus died on the cross, they were all greatly disappointed.<br/>The two disciples on the road to Emmaus, so sad. "Hey, fellows. How come you're so sad as your walking along?" "What do you mean? You must be a stranger around here if you don't know the things that have been happening lately in Jerusalem." "What things?" "Oh, a fellow by the name of Jesus of Nazareth...oh man, it was mighty and powerful. The anointing of God was upon His life. We had hoped that in Him was the deliverance of Israel, but they crucified Him. We had hoped . . . now it's dead." Now He's risen, and He's saying, "In a few days, fellows, you're going to receive the promise of the Father." "Oh, what promise? The promise of the establishing of the kingdom?" You see, it was legitimate that they should ask. "Is this it Lord? Alright! Is this the time? Are you going to set up your kingdom now?" "No. It's not for you to know those times that the Father's appointed or that the Father has in His own power. But, you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you."<br/>Now here, the Greek preposition epi is used to signify a new relationship that they were to have with the Holy Spirit. In the Gospel According to John, chapter 14, as Jesus is there promising to send the Holy Spirit, He said, "I will not leave you comfortless. I will come to you, and I will pray the Father, and He will send to you another comforter, even the Spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth Him not neither knows Him, but you know Him for He dwells with you, and He shall be in you" ( Joh 14:17-18 ). Same Greek preposition as ours, only they spell it "en" instead of "in." Two-fold relationship there in John: He is with you, but He's going to be dwelling in you. But now Jesus said you're going to receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you. The Greek preposition epi, which is translated in different texts throughout the New Testament as "upon" or "over" or I like it, "overflows."<br/>In the seventh chapter of the gospel of John: "On the last day, the great day of the feast when Jesus stood there on the Temple Mount and cried to the people, 'If any man thirst let him come unto Me and drink: and he who drinks of the water that I give, out of his innermost being there will gush torrents of living water.'" John said, "This spake He of the Spirit, which was not yet given which they who believe on Him should receive" ( Joh 7:37-39 ). What did He speak of the Spirit? That it would be like a torrent of living water flowing out. I like, "When the Spirit overflows you," upon you, or over you, or overflows from you. So the three-fold relationship: He is with you prior to your conversion, He is the one who causes you to realize that you are a sinner, He is the one who points to Jesus Christ as the answer as He convinces the world of sin, of righteous, and of judgment. The moment you open your life and heart to Jesus Christ and invite Him to come in, the Holy Spirit comes and begins to indwell you. He shall be in you. "Know ye not that you are not your own, you have been bought with a price, therefore glorify God in your body and your spirit which are His. And know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit which is in you? Be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess, but be filled, or be ye being filled with the Spirit" ( 1Co 6:19-20 ,Eph 5:18 ). But now here's a third relationship. This is an empowering experience.<br/>You will receive [the dunamus] the dynamics, when the Holy Spirit has come [epi] upon you [or over you, or when there is that overflow from you]: and ye shall be witnesses unto me ( Act 1:8 )<br/>And so the dynamic, to be a witness for Jesus Christ. It is interesting that the word witness in Greek is the word martus from where we get our word martyr. And in Greek it does mean martyr. A witness is one who not only proclaims what he believes, he lives what he believes, he is what he believes, and he believes it so strongly, that if necessary, he'll die for what he believes. That's how strong is his belief. He's a martus. You can't stop him. He's not afraid to die for what he believes.<br/>You remember when Paul was on his way back to Jerusalem and Agabus came down from Caesarea and he took Paul's girdle and tied himself up and he said, "So is the man who owns this girdle to be bound when he gets to Jerusalem." And Paul's friends began to weep, saying, "Oh, Paul, don't go, don't go." And he said, "What do you mean by these tears? Do you think you're going to dissuade me? Do you think I'm worried about being bound? I'm ready to die." He was a martus. "I'm ready to die." Being put to death for your faith did not make you a martyr; because you were a martyr, you were put to death. Because you were a witness, because you believed it so strong. So, it did not make you a witness, it only proved what you were. You were a witness all along. If you hadn't been a martus, you would've never gone to your death. You would've recanted; you would've said, "Whoa, whoa, wait, wait. Hold on, let's change course here. I think that I may have made a mistake." Then you say, "Well, he wasn't a martus. Stealing a horse doesn't make you a horse thief; it only proves that you were. No one steals a horse unless he's a horse thief. So, stealing it doesn't make you a horse thief, it only proves that you were all along. Being martyred only proves what you were a witness, a martus. "And you will be witnesses." And isn't it interesting that most of them were martyred? "Witnesses unto Me."<br/>The witness was to be both in Jerusalem, and in all of Judea ( Act 1:8 ),<br/>The witness began right at home. The hardest place, isn't it? It's to start right at home in Jerusalem, and then the area around Jerusalem, the area of Judea. And then it was to spread up into Samaria. And then it was to go out into the uttermost parts of the world. And as we study the book of Acts, we will see this very progression. How the witness began in Jerusalem. We'll get that in the next chapter. And then we'll see how it began to spread through out Judea. And then Phillip went up into Samaria, and then finally Paul and Barnabas are called to go into the uttermost parts of the world. And so the witness spread through the anointing and the empowering of the Holy Spirit.<br/>Now when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight ( Act 1:9 ).<br/>This is the final promise made by Jesus to His disciples. This is it, the final words prior to His ascension. Of course, later He came and talked to Paul and others, but prior to His ascension, this is His final word. And upon this, when He had spoken these things, while they were watching Him, He was taken up and a cloud received Him out of their sight.<br/>And while they were looking steadfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, there were two men who stood by them in white apparel ( Act 1:10 );<br/>We assume they were angels.<br/>Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as you have seen him go into heaven ( Act 1:11 ).<br/>They saw Him as He ascended up into heaven and they will behold Him when He comes again. "Behold the Lord cometh with ten thousands of His saints, to execute judgement upon the earth" (Jud 1:14-15). And then, "Unto Him who loved us and gave Himself for us and who has made us unto our God, kings and priests who shall reign with Him upon the earth, behold the Lord cometh, and every eye shall see Him, and they also who pierced Him shall mourn" Rev 1:5-7 ). So the Lord's coming. Every eye shall see Him. The Jehovah Witnesses say that He is already come, but it was a secret coming. As it was only the disciples that saw Him go, it was only the disciples, of the Jehovah Witnesses, who saw Him return. But Jesus said, "If they say unto you, 'He has come in secret and has gone into a secret chamber don't believe it'" ( Mat 24:26 ). So you have to choose, to believe Jesus or them.<br/>"This same Jesus which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as you've seen Him go into heaven."<br/>Now there's a very interesting verse in II John, verse Act 1:7 , "For many deceivers are entered into the world who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh." That, unfortunately, is a poor translation of the Greek. For this participle is in the present tense and should be translated "is coming in the flesh." Those who would deny that Jesus Christ is coming in the flesh. What does John say of them? "They are a deceiver and an antichrist. Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward. For whosoever transgresses and abides not in the doctrine of Christ, has not God. He that abides in the doctrine of Christ, he has both the Father and the Son. And if there come any unto your door (on Saturday morning) and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, and neither bid him good-bye. For he that bids him good-bye is a partaker of his evil deeds" (2Jn 1:7-11). Ask them one question, "Is Jesus coming in the flesh?" Just ask them that question. And if they say no, just remember what John warned you and what John told you. "If any confess not that Jesus Christ is coming in the flesh." Do you remember when He was with the disciples and He said, "Give me something to eat"? He said, "You know, spirits don't eat; touch me. See? It's me." So, this same Jesus is coming again in the same manner in which they saw Him go into heaven. And I, for one, believe that that coming is very soon.<br/>Then retuned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a Sabbath's day journey [about two-thirds of a mile]. And when they were come in, they went up into an upper room, where there abode both Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, and Phillip, and Thomas, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon Zelotes, and Judas the brother of James. And these all continued in one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers ( Act 1:12-14 ).<br/>This is the last mention of Mary the mother of Jesus. At this point and from this point on, there is no further mention of her in the Acts of the Apostles or in the epistles. No mention of her death or of her miraculous ascension into heaven, without death. Nothing is mentioned in the scripture. It is silent.<br/>His brethren would be a reference probably to James and to Jude and to those other brothers who were sons of Joseph and Mary.<br/>The upper room--there are some who say that it is the same upper room in which Jesus had the Last Supper with His disciples. And yet, there are others who hold to this upper room being a room in the temple precincts where the early church met. Take your choice.<br/>And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples, and said, (the number of their names together were about one hundred and twenty,) men and brethren, this Scripture must needs have been fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit by the mouth of David spake before concerning Judas, which was a guide to those who took Jesus ( Act 1:15-16 ).<br/>Here again, Peter still his same impetuous self. They're waiting in prayer and supplication, and Peter stands up and says, "Fellows, there's a scripture that's gotta be fulfilled." And you know he's going to move ahead, "Let's get the program going; let's cast lots and find out who's going to take Judas' place." I do feel that Peter was again in the flesh, manifesting that impetuous nature that was his. And I think that the future history of the church in the book of Acts points this out. I am interested in Peter's understanding of the scriptures, how that he is quoting from so many places in the Old Testament. Peter does manifest a very great understanding of the Old Testament scriptures which is a point in his favor.<br/>Notice that Peter ascribes to the Holy Spirit those things that David wrote. So that, "All scripture is given by inspiration of God" ( 2Ti 3:16 ). Not part of the scriptures. Because, if you tell me that part of the scriptures are given by inspiration of God, then I must ask you, "What parts are by inspiration and what parts are not by inspiration?" And then you are then the authority who tells me what part I can believe and what part I can't believe. And the minute that God is no longer the authority but you're the authority, I'm in trouble. Beware of those who say, "Well, you can't believe all of the scriptures." The scriptures themselves say, "All scripture is given by inspiration of God." And here, Luke in writing of what Peter was saying, declares that David was actually the spokesman for the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit, by the mouth of David, spake concerning Judas.<br/>For he was numbered with us, [he was one of the twelve] he had obtained a part of this ministry. But now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity; and falling headlong ( Act 1:17-18 ),<br/>He purchased the field, the potter's field as Zachariah the eleventh chapter declares.<br/>and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all of his bowels gushed out ( Act 1:18 ).<br/>There are those who find a discrepancy in the scriptures, because in one of the gospels we are told that when Judas came back and tried to return the money, and they said, "Hey, it's your problem. We can't take it." And put it back in the temple treasury. "It's blood money." Then he threw it there on the floor of the temple and he went out and hung himself. Here Peter tells us that he fell headlong and just popped. And there are those who imagine a discrepancy. Very simple, he went up into the tree to hang himself, tied the rope around his neck and tied it to the limb and jumped. And the force of the fall either snapped the rope or his head, and he fell on down into the canyon and just as he said it here.<br/>It was known to all of the dwellers at Jerusalem; insomuch that the field is called in their tongue, Aceldama, that is to say, The field of blood. For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be desolate, and let no man dwell therein: and, His bishoprick let another take ( Act 1:19-20 ).<br/>Now in reality he's quoting from two different Psalms here. From Psa 69:25 ,he puts it together with Psa 109:8 . And putting the two together he finds these prophecies concerning Judas.<br/>Wherefore of these men ( Act 1:21 )<br/>Now here is where they are looking for someone to take Judas' place to be an apostle. Here are the qualifications they looked for in that time.<br/>Wherefore of these men which have companied with us all the time that the Lord Jesus when in and out among us ( Act 1:21 ),<br/>Now you remember there were many disciples, many disciples of which Jesus chose ten to be apostles. And the word apostle means "one who is sent out." Or chose twelve to be apostles, so He sent out the twelve. The number of human government. "We only have eleven. We need one to take Judas' place, but we need one who has been with us all the while from the beginning with Jesus."<br/>From the time he was baptized by John, until the day he was taken up from us, must one be ordained to be a witness [of what?] of His resurrection ( Act 1:22 ).<br/>So these were the requirements they were looking for. Someone who had been around the whole while. From the time of John's baptism to the ascension. And one who saw the risen Lord, and thus could bear fact of the resurrection, their testimony to the fact.<br/>Now Paul the apostle, later in asserting the fact that he was an apostle said, "Have I not seen the risen Christ?" Evidently that was one of the requirements of apostleship. Someone asked me, "Are there apostles today?" Well, I don't know. I don't think that there are in the same sense that they were in the New Testament. Surely there is none today who can bear witness to the resurrection as they did.<br/>They appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias. And they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord, which knowest the hearts of all men, show whether of these two that you have chosen ( Act 1:23-24 ),<br/>I think that we often make this mistake of giving the Lord two choices, both wrong. Limiting God, you see. We're so prone to do this. Obviously, Paul was God's choice. Peter was impetuous, and jumping the gun said, "Hey, we've got to do something, you know, gotta help God out. You know, one's missing and we've got to fill him in." And yet, "God, which one of these two do you want?" And giving God the two choices.<br/>That he may take part of this ministry and this apostleship, from which Judas by the transgression fell, that he might go to his own place. And so they gave forth their lots ( Act 1:25-26 );<br/>An interesting way by which they sought to determine the will of God. Let's throw dice, find out what God's will is here. It's interesting to me, the various ways that people have devised to discern the will of God. Now, in the Old Testament times they had an interesting way of coming to the priest, who would inquire of the Lord for them through the Urim and the Thummim, the "lights and perfections." Just what these Urim and Thummim were, we don't know. I'm sure they were not the colored glasses that Joseph Smith found with the Golden Tablets; the magic glasses, that when you put them on, you could suddenly read the hieroglyphic writing.<br/>There are those who say that the Urim and Thummim were actually a black and a white stone that was worn in a pouch on the chest of the priest. They would pray and ask the Lord a particular question. You remember that David was asking the Lord definite questions: "Lord, shall we go out against the Philistines?" The answer was, "No." So again, the next day, "Lord, shall we go out against the Philistines?" The answer was, "Yes." "When shall we go?" They would ask specific questions, and the Lord would direct them through the Urim and the Thummin. They say that the priest would pray, seek God, and then reach in and pull out one of the two stones. If it was the white stone, it was a yes answer. If it was a no, then it would be the black stone that he would pull out. Some even say we get the term blackballed from this Urim and Thummim. Actually, back in the original it is a no vote against a particular project or idea. Just what the Urim and Thummim were, we don't know. But during the Old Testament period, they did use a method of casting lots to determine the will of God.<br/>So here the disciples are picking up on the same thing as they are throwing the dice to see which of the two fellows that God had chosen to replace Judas Iscariot.<br/>the lot fell on Matthias; he was numbered with the eleven ( Act 1:26 ).<br/>Now who in the world is Matthias? No one ever heard of him before or since. It'll be interesting to meet Matthias and find out who he is and what he did. I think from the subsequent history, it's obvious to assume that God chose Paul as an apostle. Paul declares it himself. Now this is the last time we ever read of them seeking to discern the will of God by the casting of lots or by a chance kind of a thing.<br/>I know a fellow today, in seeking to discern the will of the Lord, will pray and ask the Lord a question. He'll have ten pennies in his pocket, and as he's praying, he'll take the pennies with his eyes closed and put them down on the table, and if they all come up heads, it's a yes. An interesting thing, every once in a while, they'll all come up heads, and that's pretty good odds. Yet, we don't find any pattern for this after the Holy Spirit was given. Once the Holy Spirit came upon the church, then the Holy Spirit began to speak to them and direct them. And the Holy Spirit said, "Separate unto me Paul and Barnabas for the ministry where I have called them" ( Act 13:2 ). And the Holy Spirit sent them forth. So we find the church more directly guided by the Holy Spirit. Once the Holy Spirit came, this throwing dice to find out the will of God was set aside.<br/>"<br/><br/>King James Version<br/><br/>This is the 1769 King James Version of the Holy Bible (also known as the Authorized Version). "Public Domain" | Smith Chuck - A travers la Bible, série C2000, nous allons nous tourner vers le livre des Actes, chapitre un, alors que nous commençons notre étude de l'église primitive.<br/>Luc, l'auteur du livre des Actes, un compagnon de l'apôtre Paul, qui était aussi l'auteur de l'Evangile selon Luc, a écrit ces deux traités à un ami, Théophile. Théophile est un nom grec. C'est un nom qui a une belle signification. Il y en a qui croient que ce n'était pas du tout un homme, mais que l'évangile et le livre des Actes étaient adressés aux amis de Dieu, qui que vous soyez. Il y a d'autres traditions qui disent que Théophile était en fait le maître de Luc, qu'à cette époque les médecins étaient des esclaves, généralement l'esclave d'un riche patron. Ainsi, le maître de Luc était Théophile, et il a libéré Luc pour être avec Paul sur les voyages missionnaires. Ainsi, Luc écrit à son ancien maître. C'est une tradition ancienne de l'église, mais il est, bien sûr, impossible de prouver, comme beaucoup de traditions.<br/>Il y a aussi ceux qui croient que lorsque Paul était à Troas et qu'il a reçu une vision d'un homme l'appelant en disant: "Venez en Macédoine et aidez-nous", que cet homme dans la vision de Paul n'était autre que Luc. Car le premier que Paul a vraiment rencontré quand il est venu en Macédoine était Luc. Et comme nous sommes dans le livre des Actes, vous constaterez que lorsque nous arrivons à cette partie du livre des Actes, Luc commence à écrire plus à la première personne plutôt qu'à la troisième personne. C'est donc, évidemment, à ce point particulier dans les Actes des Apôtres que Luc est devenu un compagnon de Paul et a commencé à voyager avec lui. Il a commencé à utiliser les pronoms "nous" et "nous" au lieu de "eux" et "eux". C'est sans aucun doute là que Luke est devenu un participant et un témoin oculaire de ces choses qui se produisaient à partir de ce moment-là. Nous vous le ferons savoir quand nous en arriverons là.<br/>Il commence les Actes des Apôtres en les liant à l’Évangile selon Luc. Il est intéressant de noter que la toute dernière chose que Luc rapporte dans son Évangile est la toute première chose qu’il rapporte dans les Actes des Apôtres. Nous voyons l'évangile de Luc se refermer alors que Jésus dit à Ses disciples d'attendre à Jérusalem jusqu'à ce qu'ils soient revêtus de la puissance d'en haut. Puis Jésus est monté au ciel, et ainsi il ferme l'évangile. En ouvrant les Actes des Apôtres, il écrit,<br/>Le premier traité [c'est-à-dire, l'Évangile selon Luc,] Je vous ai écrit, O Theophilus, de tout ce que Jésus a commencé à faire et à enseigner (Actes 1:1),<br/>Le mot clé est commencé. L'Évangile selon Luc n'est pas l'histoire complète du ministère de Jésus-Christ. Ce n'est que le début du ministère de Jésus-Christ. Jésus continue à servir les besoins des gens. Jésus continue à guérir les malades. Jésus continue à prêcher Son amour et Son évangile au monde, seulement maintenant Il prêche à travers ces disciples qui ont été oints de Son Saint-Esprit. Mais le ministère du Christ continue; au fond, c'est la prémisse que Luc prend dans les Actes des Apôtres. Le premier traité de tout ce que Jésus a commencé, à la fois à faire et à enseigner.<br/>Maintenant, à cause de cela, les Actes des Apôtres est un livre inachevé: en ce que le Seigneur continue aujourd'hui à travailler à travers la vie de ceux qui se sont consacrés à être les instruments de Dieu. Pour être conduit, guidé et oint par Son Saint-Esprit, pour continuer le ministère de Jésus dans le monde aujourd’hui. Maintenant, Dieu a ordonné que Son œuvre devrait être accomplie par des instruments humains. Je ne dis pas qu’elle doit être accomplie. Dieu peut utiliser des êtres angéliques pour Son œuvre, et il viendra un temps, pendant le livre de l’Apocalypse, où Dieu utilisera des anges pour proclamer Son évangile aux gens du monde entier. Apocalypse, chapitre 14, "Le premier ange volant au milieu du ciel ayant l'évangile éternel" (Apocalypse 14:6). Mais à l'heure actuelle, Dieu a choisi d'utiliser des instruments humains. Aussi imparfaits qu'ils puissent être, pourtant c'est ce que Dieu a ordonné d'utiliser. Ce qui est excitant, c'est que Dieu va m'utiliser et Dieu va vous utiliser. Tant de fois, nous supplions, "Seigneur, je ne peux pas parler. Je n'ai jamais été capable de parler avant ou même maintenant, Seigneur." Comme Moïse a essayé de supplier l'appel de Dieu. Jérémie a dit: «Seigneur, je ne suis qu’un enfant; personne ne va m’écouter.» Et nous avons tous nos excuses pour ne pas pouvoir être utilisés. N’est-ce pas? Nous connaissons tous les raisons pour lesquelles Dieu ne pouvait pas nous utiliser.<br/>Une fois, alors que le Seigneur appelait un prophète pour faire Son œuvre, il a dit: «Seigneur, envoie qui tu veux.» Le Seigneur a dit: «Hé, je t’ai appelé.» Très souvent, nous sommes dans cette position: «Seigneur, envoie par la main de qui tu veux, n’importe qui sauf moi Seigneur.» Et pourtant, Dieu a ordonné de nous utiliser.<br/>Maintenant, chacun de nous peut montrer ses propres imperfections. Chacun de nous peut indiquer ses propres incapacités, et chacun de nous peut trouver une excuse pour laquelle Dieu ne voudrait pas m'utiliser. Mais pourtant, Dieu a choisi de vous utiliser. Pour qu'à travers votre vie, Il puisse Se révéler à un monde dans le besoin. Vous vous demandez quand Dieu a de tels instruments pour utiliser comment Il a déjà accompli le travail, n'est-ce pas?<br/>Jusqu'au jour où il a été enlevé, après que par le Saint-Esprit il avait donné des commandements aux apôtres qu'il avait choisis (Actes 1:2).<br/>C’est avec cela qu’il termina l’Évangile de Luc, le jour où Jésus fut enlevé, après qu’il eut dit aux apôtres d’attendre le don du pouvoir.<br/>A qui lui aussi [c'est-à-dire les apôtres] il s'est montré vivant pour eux après sa passion [ou sa mort] par de nombreuses preuves infaillibles (Actes 1:3),<br/>Il est difficile de nier le fait de la résurrection de Jésus-Christ. J'ai été amusé, ainsi qu'ennuyé et irrité, par un article que j'ai lu dans le registre de Santa Ana ce samedi dernier. De la science de la création et des théories évolutionnistes présentées dans les écoles de comté. Comment cela, ce professeur a dit qu'il enseigne une classe de sciences, et donc, ils ne traitent que des faits, et qu'ils n'ont pas de place pour les théories. Parce que la science est basée sur des faits et la création est basée sur des superstitions religieuses. Il faut beaucoup de foi pour croire les théories religieuses. Lorsque vous traitez de faits, vous pouvez simplement les accepter. Je me suis dit: «Très intéressant dans cette classe de sciences, ils m'ont appris que le monde avait quatre milliards d'années. Aujourd'hui, ils enseignent que c'est un fait que le monde a douze milliards d'années. Il n’y a pas si longtemps, j’allais à l’école. »<br/>Il est intéressant de noter que la Bible n'a jamais eu besoin d'être révisée ou mise à jour pour répondre aux données actuelles que les hommes ont découvertes. Et pourtant, si vous preniez mes manuels de sciences du secondaire aujourd’hui et que vous essayiez d’enseigner une classe de sciences à partir d’eux, vous constateriez que beaucoup de choses qui ont été enseignées comme des faits scientifiques lorsque j’étais au lycée ne sont plus reconnues comme des faits scientifiques. Le protoplasme cellulaire simple n'est plus une cellule simple, mais extrêmement complexe. S'il y a un fait qui peut être attesté dans l'histoire, c'est le fait de la résurrection de Jésus-Christ d'entre les morts.<br/>Nous avons un système de jurisprudence fondé sur les témoignages. Si un homme est accusé d'un crime et qu'il y a des gens qui ont été témoins de ce crime pendant qu'il était commis, et qu'ils sont amenés à la norme, et qu'ils jurent de dire la vérité, toute la vérité, et rien que la vérité, alors aidez-les Dieu. Et dans leur interrogatoire, ils affirment: "J'ai vu cet homme à la banque le 23 mai. Je l'ai vu sortir un pistolet de son manteau. Je l'ai entendu demander que tout l'argent lui soit donné. Je l'ai vu en quittant la banque. Je l'ai vu comme l'officier l'a appréhendé à l'extérieur." Et si vous pouvez obtenir trois ou quatre témoins pour pointer vers cet homme et garder leur témoignage en contre-interrogatoire, cet homme est jugé coupable. C'est lui qui l'a fait. Nous avons deux ou trois témoins qui témoignent de la même histoire au sujet de cet homme, et il est admis que c'est lui qui a commis le crime et qu'il est coupable.<br/>Après la mort de Jésus, quand il est ressuscité, il est apparu à beaucoup de gens différents qui ont témoigné sous serment qu'ils l'ont vu, qu'ils lui ont parlé, qu'il leur est apparu en divers endroits dans différentes circonstances. Et pendant une période de quarante jours, Il les visitait. Et en même temps, jusqu’à cinq cents personnes qui étaient rassemblées en un même lieu, Il est apparu. Il est difficile de simplement rejeter ou nier le témoignage de ces gens. Le faire, c’est discréditer tout notre système jurisprudentiel. Mais pas seulement cela, ces hommes qui ont témoigné qu’ils ont vu le Seigneur ressuscité, qu’ils lui ont parlé, qu’ils ont mangé avec lui, ils ont tous, à l’exception d’un seul, rencontré des morts violentes de la part d’autres personnes parce qu’ils affirmaient que l’histoire qu’ils racontaient était vraie. Vous parlez de témoins qui ont juré de dire la vérité, toute la vérité, rien que la vérité. Si la vie d'une personne était menacée à cause de ce témoin, et que c'était un mensonge, au moins un d'entre eux aurait été brisé sous la pression. Ils auraient avoué à tout le canular: "Il s'est montré vivant après Sa passion par de nombreuses preuves infaillibles."<br/>étant vu d'eux pendant quarante jours, leur parlant des choses relatives au royaume de Dieu (Actes 1:3):<br/>Parfois, nous blâmons les disciples à cause de leurs questions sur le moment du royaume de Dieu. Rappelons-nous que le royaume de Dieu était le sujet préféré de Jésus-Christ. Il parlait toujours du royaume de Dieu, et c’est un grand espoir qu’il plantait dans le cœur de tous les hommes. Les choses ne vont pas toujours continuer à se corrompre comme elles sont. Le monde ne passera pas pour toujours sous la puissance des ténèbres, sous l’esclavage du mal. Dieu établira un jour Son royaume sur la terre. Un royaume de joie et de paix justes. "Jésus régnera, où avant que le soleil ne parcoure ses voyages successifs, et son royaume s'étendra de rivage en rivage." Et ce jour-là sera le jour le plus glorieux que le monde ait jamais vu, car la maladie, la souffrance et la douleur seront abolies dans Son royaume, comme le péché, la cupidité et ces choses qui ont rendu le monde si intolérable seront abolies dans Son royaume. Le mercantilisme impie, l'exploitation de l'homme, toutes ces choses ont été abolies dans Son glorieux royaume quand Il règne. Il n'est pas étonnant que les disciples étaient impatients de le faire. J'ai hâte de le faire; j'ai hâte que Son royaume vienne. Et Jésus nous a dit quand nous prions, la première demande est: «Que ton règne vienne; que ta volonté soit faite sur la terre, comme elle est dans les cieux» (Matt 6:10). C'est le bon genre de désir que nous devrions tous avoir. Je désire le royaume de Dieu. Et ainsi, Il leur parlait, pendant cette période de quarante jours, du royaume.<br/>Et, étant assemblés avec eux, il leur a ordonné de ne pas quitter Jérusalem, mais attendre la promesse du Père, qui, dit-il, vous avez entendu parler de moi (Actes 1:4).<br/>Il a dit: «Maintenant, regardez, attendez ici à Jérusalem jusqu’à ce que vous receviez la promesse du Père.» Cette promesse à laquelle il fait référence est, sans aucun doute, la promesse de Joël où le Seigneur a promis: «Et il arrivera dans les derniers jours, dit le Seigneur, que je répandrai mon Esprit sur toute chair; et vos fils et vos filles prophétiseront, et vos jeunes hommes feront des rêves, vos vieillards verront des visions; et je répandrai mon Esprit sur mes serviteurs et mes servantes, dit le Seigneur» (Joël 2:29). La promesse du Père : un jour viendra où Dieu déversera Son Esprit sur toute chair, sur tous les croyants, qui recevront cette dynamique de Dieu.<br/>Car Jean a vraiment baptisé d'eau; mais vous serez baptisés du Saint-Esprit dans peu de jours (Actes 1:5).<br/>Jean a baptisé avec de l’eau, il a submergé les gens dans l’eau, «vous allez être submergés dans le Saint-Esprit en peu de jours.»<br/>Lorsqu'ils furent assemblés, ils l'interrogèrent, et dirent: Seigneur, veux-tu en ce temps-ci rendre le royaume à Israël?<br/>Et Jésus leur parle maintenant, non pas du royaume, mais de la puissance qu’ils vont recevoir pour le service. Et alors, Il écarte leur question.<br/>En leur disant: Ce n'est pas à vous de connaître les temps ou les saisons que le Père a mis en son pouvoir (Actes 1:7).<br/>"Ce n'est pas à vous de le savoir." Ils vivaient constamment dans l'anticipation de la mise en place immédiate du royaume. Pendant toute la vie de Jésus, ils s'attendaient à ce qu'il entre à tout moment dans la cabine téléphonique et en ressorte comme le sauveur du monde. Shazzam! montrant sa puissance et de renverser les gouvernements du monde, l'établissement du royaume de Dieu sur la terre. Et ils attendaient tous les jours pour ce changement à transpirer. Et chaque fois que Jésus parlait d’aller à Jérusalem, d’être remis entre les mains d’un homme pécheur, et d’être ensuite crucifié, il disait: «Oh! oh! non, Seigneur! non, non, tu ne comprends pas le royaume, Seigneur! Quand Jésus est mort sur la croix, ils ont tous été très déçus.<br/>Les deux disciples sur la route d'Emmaus, si tristes. "Hé, les gars. Comment se fait-il que vous soyez si triste que votre marche le long?" "Qu'est-ce que vous voulez dire? Vous devez être un étranger ici si vous ne savez pas les choses qui se sont produites ces derniers temps à Jérusalem." "Quelles choses?" "Oh, un homme du nom de Jésus de Nazareth...oh homme, c'était puissant et puissant. L'onction de Dieu était sur Sa vie. Nous avions espéré qu'en Lui était la délivrance d'Israël, mais ils L'ont crucifié. Nous avions espéré... maintenant c'est mort." Maintenant, Il est ressuscité, et Il dit: «Dans quelques jours, mes amis, vous allez recevoir la promesse du Père.» «Oh! quelle promesse? La promesse de l’établissement du royaume?» Voyez-vous, il était légitime qu’ils demandent: «Est-ce là Seigneur? Très bien! Est-ce le moment? Allez-vous établir votre royaume maintenant? "Non. Ce n'est pas à vous de connaître ces temps que le Père a établis ou que le Père a en Sa propre puissance. Mais, vous recevrez la puissance quand le Saint-Esprit sera venu sur vous."<br/>Maintenant, ici, l’épi de préposition grecque est utilisé pour signifier une nouvelle relation qu’ils devaient avoir avec le Saint-Esprit. Dans l’Évangile selon Jean, chapitre 14, alors que Jésus est là en train de promettre d’envoyer le Saint-Esprit, Il a dit : « Je ne vous laisserai pas sans consolation. Je viendrai à vous, et je prierai le Père, et il vous enverra un autre consolateur, même l'Esprit de Vérité que le monde ne peut pas recevoir parce qu'il ne le voit pas et ne le connaît pas, mais vous le connaissez car il habite avec vous, et il sera en vous » (Jean 14:17-18). La même préposition grecque que la nôtre, seulement ils l'écrivent "en" au lieu de "in". Double relation là en Jean: Il est avec vous, mais Il va demeurer en vous. Mais maintenant Jésus a dit que vous allez recevoir la puissance quand le Saint-Esprit viendra sur vous. L'épi de préposition grecque, qui est traduit dans différents textes à travers le Nouveau Testament comme "sur" ou "au-dessus" ou je l'aime, "débordements".<br/>Dans le septième chapitre de l’évangile de Jean : « Le dernier jour, le grand jour de la fête où Jésus se tenait là sur le mont du Temple et criait au peuple : ‘Si quelqu’un a soif, qu’il vienne à moi et qu’il boive ; et celui qui boit de l’eau que je donne, de son être le plus intime, jaillira des torrents d’eau vive.’ » Jean a dit: «Celui-ci a parlé de l'Esprit, qui n'a pas encore été donné que ceux qui croient en lui devraient recevoir» (Joh 7:37-39). Qu'a-t-il dit de l'Esprit? Ce serait comme un torrent d'eau vive qui coulerait. J'aime: "Quand l'Esprit vous déborde", sur vous, ou au-dessus de vous, ou déborde de vous. Donc, la triple relation: Il est avec vous avant votre conversion, Il est celui qui vous fait réaliser que vous êtes un pécheur, Il est celui qui désigne Jésus-Christ comme la réponse car Il convainc le monde du péché, du juste et du jugement. Dès que vous ouvrez votre vie et votre cœur à Jésus-Christ et que vous L’invitez à entrer, le Saint-Esprit vient et commence à vous habiter. Il sera en vous. Ne savez-vous pas que vous n'êtes pas à vous, que vous avez été rachetés à prix d'argent? Glorifiez donc Dieu dans votre corps et dans votre esprit, qui sont les siens; et ne savez-vous pas que votre corps est le temple du Saint-Esprit qui est en vous? Ne vous enivrez pas de vin, dans lequel il y a excès, mais soyez remplis, ou soyez remplis de l’Esprit » ( 1Co 6:19-20 , Eph 5:18 ). Mais maintenant, voici une troisième relation. C’est une expérience qui donne du pouvoir.<br/>Vous recevrez [le dunamus] la dynamique, quand le Saint-Esprit sera venu sur vous [ou sur vous, ou quand il y aura un débordement de votre part] ; et vous serez mes témoins (Actes 1:8).<br/>Et donc la dynamique, d'être un témoin pour Jésus-Christ. Il est intéressant que le mot témoignage en grec est le mot martus d'où nous obtenons notre mot martyr. Et en grec, cela signifie martyr. Un témoin est quelqu'un qui non seulement proclame ce qu'il croit, il vit ce qu'il croit, il est ce qu'il croit, et il le croit si fortement, que si nécessaire, il mourra pour ce qu'il croit. Il n'a pas peur de mourir pour ce qu'il croit.<br/>Vous vous souvenez quand Paul était sur le chemin du retour à Jérusalem et Agabus est descendu de Césarée et il a pris la ceinture de Paul et s'est attaché et il a dit: "L'homme qui possède cette ceinture sera lié quand il arrivera à Jérusalem." Et les amis de Paul ont commencé à pleurer, disant: "Oh, Paul, n'y va pas, n'y va pas." Et il a dit: "Qu'entendez-vous par ces larmes? Pensez-vous que vous allez me dissuader? Pensez-vous que je suis inquiet d'être lié? Je suis prêt à mourir." C'était un Martus. "Je suis prêt à mourir." Etre mis à mort pour votre foi n'a pas fait de vous un martyr; parce que vous étiez un martyr, vous avez été mis à mort. Parce que vous étiez un témoin, parce que vous le croyiez si fort. Donc, cela n'a pas fait de vous un témoin, cela a seulement prouvé ce que vous étiez. Vous étiez un témoin depuis le début. Si vous n'aviez pas été un Martus, vous ne seriez jamais allé à votre mort. Vous vous seriez rétracté; vous auriez dit: "Whoa, whoa, attendez, attendez. Attendez, changeons de cap ici. Je pense que j'ai peut-être fait une erreur. " Alors vous dites, "Eh bien, il n'était pas un martus. Voler un cheval ne fait pas de vous un voleur de cheval; cela prouve seulement que vous l'étiez. Personne ne vole un cheval à moins qu'il ne soit un voleur de cheval. Donc, le voler ne fait pas de vous un voleur de chevaux, cela prouve seulement que vous étiez depuis le début. Etre martyr ne prouve que ce que vous étiez témoin, un Martus. "Et vous serez témoins." Et n'est-il pas intéressant que la plupart d'entre eux aient été martyrisés? "Témoins pour moi."<br/>Le témoin devait être à Jérusalem et dans toute la Judée (Actes 1:8).<br/>Le témoin a commencé à la maison. L'endroit le plus difficile, n'est-ce pas? C'est pour commencer à la maison à Jérusalem, et ensuite la région autour de Jérusalem, la région de Judée. Et ensuite, c'était pour se répandre en Samarie. Et alors, c'était pour aller dans les parties les plus reculées du monde. Et pendant que nous étudions le livre des Actes, nous verrons cette progression même. Comment le témoignage a commencé à Jérusalem. Nous verrons cela dans le chapitre suivant. Et alors, nous verrons comment cela a commencé à se répandre dans toute la Judée. Puis Philippe est monté en Samarie, et finalement Paul et Barnabas sont appelés à aller dans les parties les plus reculées du monde. Ainsi, le témoignage s’est répandu par l’onction et la puissance du Saint-Esprit.<br/>Lorsqu'il eut dit ces choses, pendant qu'ils les voyaient, il fut enlevé, et une nuée l'emporta hors de leur vue (Actes 1:9).<br/>C’est la dernière promesse faite par Jésus à Ses disciples. C’est elle, les derniers mots avant Son ascension. Bien sûr, plus tard, Il est venu et a parlé à Paul et à d’autres, mais avant Son ascension, c’est Son dernier mot. Et là-dessus, quand il eut dit ces choses, pendant qu'ils l'observaient, il fut enlevé et une nuée l'emporta hors de leurs yeux.<br/>Et comme ils regardaient fixement vers le ciel, comme il montait, voici, il y avait deux hommes qui se tenaient à côté d'eux en vêtements blancs (Actes 1:10).<br/>Nous supposons qu'ils étaient des anges.<br/>Et qui a dit: Hommes Galiléens, pourquoi vous tenez-vous là à regarder vers le ciel? ce même Jésus, qui est enlevé d'auprès de vous au ciel, viendra de la même manière que vous l'avez vu aller au ciel (Actes 1:11).<br/>Ils le virent alors qu'il montait au ciel et ils le verront quand il reviendra. "Voici que le Seigneur vient avec dix mille de ses saints, pour exécuter le jugement sur la terre" (Juges 1:14-15). « A celui qui nous a aimés et qui s’est donné lui-même pour nous, et qui nous a faits pour notre Dieu, rois et sacrificateurs qui régneront avec lui sur la terre, voici le Seigneur qui vient, et tous les yeux le verront, et ceux aussi qui l’ont transpercé se lamenteront » (Ap 1, 5-7). Ainsi, la venue du Seigneur. Chaque œil Le verra. Les Témoins de Jéhovah disent qu'Il est déjà venu, mais c'était une venue secrète. Comme seuls les disciples L'ont vu partir, seuls les disciples des Témoins de Jéhovah L'ont vu revenir. Mais Jésus a dit : « S’ils vous disent : ‘Il est venu en secret et est entré dans une chambre secrète, ne le croyez pas’ » (Mt 24, 26).<br/>"Ce même Jésus qui est enlevé d'auprès de vous au ciel viendra de la même manière que vous l'avez vu aller au ciel."<br/>Maintenant, il y a un verset très intéressant dans II Jean, le verset Actes 1:7, "Car beaucoup de séducteurs sont entrés dans le monde qui ne confessent pas que Jésus-Christ est venu dans la chair." Car ce participe est au présent et devrait être traduit par "vient dans la chair". Ceux qui nieraient que Jésus-Christ vient dans la chair. Que dit Jean d'eux? "Ils sont un trompeur et un antéchrist. Veillez sur vous-mêmes, afin que nous ne perdions pas ce que nous avons fait, mais que nous recevions une pleine récompense; car quiconque transgresse et ne demeure pas dans la doctrine du Christ n'a pas Dieu. Celui qui demeure dans la doctrine de Christ, il a à la fois le Père et le Fils. Et s'il vient quelqu'un à votre porte (le samedi matin) et n'apporte pas cette doctrine, ne le recevez pas dans votre maison, et ne lui dites pas non plus au revoir. Car celui qui lui dit au revoir participe à ses mauvaises actions » (2 Jn 1, 7-11). Posez-leur une question : « Jésus vient-il dans la chair ? » Posez-leur simplement cette question. Et s’ils disent non, rappelez-vous simplement ce que Jean vous a averti et ce que Jean vous a dit. "Si quelqu'un ne confesse pas que Jésus-Christ vient dans la chair." Vous souvenez-vous quand Il était avec les disciples et qu'Il a dit: "Donnez-moi à manger?" Il a dit: "Vous savez, les esprits ne mangent pas; touchez-moi. Voyez? C'est moi." Ainsi, ce même Jésus revient de la même manière qu’ils L’ont vu aller au ciel. Et moi, pour ma part, je crois que cette venue est très proche.<br/>Puis ils retournèrent à Jérusalem de la montagne appelée Olivet, qui est de Jérusalem un voyage d'un jour de sabbat [environ deux tiers d'un mile]. Et quand ils furent entrés, ils montèrent dans une chambre haute, où Pierre, et Jacques, et Jean, et André, et Philippe, et Thomas, et Barthélemy, et Matthieu, Jacques, fils d'Alphée, et Simon Zélotès, et Judas, frère de Jacques. Et ceux-ci ont tous continué d'un commun accord dans la prière et la supplication, avec les femmes, et Marie, la mère de Jésus, et avec ses frères (Actes 1:12-14).<br/>C'est la dernière mention de Marie, la mère de Jésus. A ce stade et à partir de ce moment, il n'y a plus de mention d'elle dans les Actes des Apôtres ou dans les épîtres. Aucune mention de sa mort ou de son ascension miraculeuse au ciel, sans la mort. Rien n’est mentionné dans l’Écriture, elle est silencieuse.<br/>Ses frères seraient probablement une référence à Jacques et à Jude et à ces autres frères qui étaient fils de Joseph et de Marie.<br/>La chambre haute, il y en a qui disent que c'est la même chambre haute dans laquelle Jésus a eu la Dernière Cène avec Ses disciples, et pourtant, il y en a d'autres qui tiennent à cette chambre haute étant une chambre dans l'enceinte du temple où l'église primitive s'est réunie. Faites votre choix.<br/>Et en ces jours-là, Pierre se leva au milieu des disciples, et dit, (le nombre de leurs noms ensemble étaient environ cent vingt,) hommes et frères, cette Écriture doit avoir été accompli, que l'Esprit Saint par la bouche de David a parlé avant au sujet de Judas, qui était un guide pour ceux qui ont pris Jésus (Actes 1:15-16).<br/>Là encore, Pierre est toujours le même impétueux. Ils attendent dans la prière et la supplication, et Pierre se lève et dit: «Fellows, il y a une Écriture qui doit être accomplie.» Et vous savez qu'il va aller de l'avant, "Allons de l'avant avec le programme; tirons au sort et découvrons qui va prendre la place de Judas." Je sens que Pierre était de nouveau dans la chair, manifestant cette nature impétueuse qui était la sienne. Et je pense que l'histoire future de l'église dans le livre des Actes le souligne. Je m'intéresse à la compréhension de Pierre des écritures, comment il cite tant d'endroits dans l'Ancien Testament. Pierre manifeste une très grande compréhension des Écritures de l’Ancien Testament, ce qui est un point en sa faveur.<br/>Notez que Pierre attribue au Saint-Esprit ces choses que David a écrit. De sorte que, "Toute Écriture est donnée par l'inspiration de Dieu" (2Ti 3:16). Ne fait pas partie des Écritures. Parce que, si vous me dites qu'une partie des écritures sont données par inspiration de Dieu, alors je dois vous demander, "Quelles parties sont par inspiration et quelles parties ne sont pas par inspiration?" Et alors vous êtes l'autorité qui me dit quelle partie je peux croire et quelle partie je ne peux pas croire. Et à la minute où Dieu n'est plus l'autorité mais vous êtes l'autorité, je suis en difficulté. Méfiez-vous de ceux qui disent: «Eh bien, vous ne pouvez pas croire toutes les Écritures.» Les Écritures elles-mêmes disent: «Toute Écriture est donnée par l'inspiration de Dieu.» Et ici, Luc, en écrivant ce que Pierre disait, déclare que David était réellement le porte-parole du Saint-Esprit. Le Saint-Esprit, par la bouche de David, parla de Judas.<br/>Car il a été compté avec nous, [il était l'un des douze] il avait obtenu une partie de ce ministère. Mais maintenant, cet homme a acheté un champ avec la récompense de l'iniquité, et tomber tête baissée (Actes 1:17-18),<br/>Il a acheté le champ, le champ du potier comme le déclare Zacharie au onzième chapitre.<br/>et tombant tête baissée, il éclata en morceaux au milieu, et toutes ses entrailles jaillirent (Actes 1:18).<br/>Il y a ceux qui trouvent une divergence dans les Écritures, parce que dans l’un des évangiles, on nous dit que lorsque Judas est revenu et a essayé de rendre l’argent, ils ont dit: «Hé, c’est votre problème. Nous ne pouvons pas le prendre.» "C'est de l'argent de sang." Puis il l'a jeté là sur le sol du temple et il est sorti et s'est pendu. Ici Pierre nous dit qu'il est tombé tête baissée et a juste sauté. Et il y a ceux qui imaginent une divergence. Très simple, il est monté dans l'arbre pour se pendre, a attaché la corde autour de son cou et l'a attachée au membre et a sauté. Et la force de la chute a soit cassé la corde ou sa tête, et il est tombé dans le canyon et juste comme il l'a dit ici.<br/>Il était connu de tous les habitants de Jérusalem, de sorte que le champ est appelé dans leur langue, Aceldama, c'est-à-dire, le champ de sang. Car il est écrit dans le livre des Psaumes: Que sa demeure soit désolée, et que personne n'y habite; et que son évêché en prenne un autre.<br/>Maintenant, en réalité, il cite deux Psaumes différents ici. De Psaumes 69:25, il met cela ensemble avec Psaume 109:8. Et en mettant les deux ensemble, il trouve ces prophéties concernant Judas.<br/>C'est pourquoi ces hommes (Actes 1:21)<br/>Maintenant, c'est ici qu'ils cherchent quelqu'un pour prendre la place de Judas en tant qu'apôtre. Voici les qualifications qu'ils recherchaient à l'époque.<br/>C'est pourquoi de ces hommes qui ont companies avec nous tout le temps que le Seigneur Jésus quand et au milieu de nous (Actes 1:21),<br/>Maintenant, vous vous souvenez qu’il y avait beaucoup de disciples, beaucoup de disciples dont Jésus a choisi dix pour être apôtres. Et le mot apôtre signifie « celui qui est envoyé. » Ou a choisi douze pour être apôtres, alors Il a envoyé les douze. Le nombre du gouvernement humain. « Nous n’en avons que onze. Nous avons besoin de quelqu’un pour prendre la place de Judas, mais nous avons besoin de quelqu’un qui est avec nous depuis le début avec Jésus. »<br/>Depuis le moment où il a été baptisé par Jean, jusqu'au jour où il a été enlevé de nous, doit-on être ordonné pour être témoin [de quoi?] de sa résurrection (Actes 1:22).<br/>Telles étaient donc les exigences qu'ils recherchaient. Quelqu'un qui avait été autour pendant tout ce temps. Du temps du baptême de Jean à l'ascension. Et quelqu'un qui a vu le Seigneur ressuscité, et pouvait ainsi porter le fait de la résurrection, leur témoignage du fait.<br/>Maintenant, l'apôtre Paul, plus tard en affirmant le fait qu'il était un apôtre a dit: "N'ai-je pas vu le Christ ressuscité?" Évidemment, c'était l'une des exigences de l'apostolat. Quelqu'un m'a demandé: "Y a-t-il des apôtres aujourd'hui?" Eh bien, je ne sais pas. Je ne pense pas qu'il y ait dans le même sens qu'ils étaient dans le Nouveau Testament. Sûrement il n'y en a aucun aujourd'hui qui peut témoigner de la résurrection comme ils l'ont fait.<br/>Ils en nommèrent deux, Joseph appelé Barsabas, surnommé Justus, et Matthias; et ils prièrent, et dirent: Toi, Seigneur, qui connais le cœur de tous les hommes, montre si tu as choisi l'un ou l'autre de ces deux hommes.<br/>Je pense que nous commettons souvent cette erreur de donner au Seigneur deux choix, tous les deux erronés. Limiter Dieu, vous voyez. Nous sommes tellement enclins à le faire. De toute évidence, Paul était le choix de Dieu. Peter était impétueux, et il a dit: «Hé, nous devons faire quelque chose, vous savez, nous devons aider Dieu. Vous savez, il en manque un et nous devons le remplir.» Et pourtant, «Dieu, lequel des deux voulez-vous?» Et donner à Dieu les deux choix.<br/>Qu'il puisse prendre part à ce ministère et à cet apostolat, dont Judas par la transgression est tombé, afin qu'il puisse aller à son propre lieu. Et ainsi ils ont donné leurs lots (Actes 1:25-26);<br/>Une façon intéressante par laquelle ils ont cherché à déterminer la volonté de Dieu. Jetons des dés, découvrons quelle est la volonté de Dieu ici. C'est intéressant pour moi, les différentes façons que les gens ont conçues pour discerner la volonté de Dieu. Maintenant, à l'époque de l'Ancien Testament, ils avaient une façon intéressante de venir vers le prêtre, qui consultait le Seigneur pour eux à travers l'Urim et le Thummim, les "lumières et les perfections". Je suis sûr que ce n'étaient pas les verres colorés que Joseph Smith a trouvés avec les tablettes d'or; les verres magiques, que lorsque vous les enfilez, vous pouviez soudainement lire l'écriture hiéroglyphique.<br/>Il y a ceux qui disent que l'urim et le thummim étaient en fait une pierre noire et blanche qui était portée dans une pochette sur la poitrine du prêtre. Ils priaient et posaient une question particulière au Seigneur. Vous souvenez-vous que David posait à l'Éternel des questions précises: "Seigneur, sortirons-nous contre les Philistins?" La réponse fut: "Non." Alors encore, le lendemain: "Seigneur, sortirons-nous contre les Philistins?" La réponse fut: "Oui." "Quand irons-nous?" Ils posaient des questions spécifiques, et le Seigneur les dirigeait à travers l’urim et le thummin. Ils disent que le prêtre prierait, chercherait Dieu, puis atteindrait et tirerait l’une des deux pierres. Si c’était la pierre blanche, c’était une réponse oui. Si c'était un non, alors ce serait la pierre noire qu'il retirerait. Certains disent même que nous obtenons le terme blackballé de cet Urim et Thummim. En fait, de retour dans l'original, c'est un non vote contre un projet ou une idée particulière. Nous ne savons pas ce qu'étaient l'urim et le thummim, mais pendant la période de l'Ancien Testament, ils ont utilisé une méthode de tirage au sort pour déterminer la volonté de Dieu.<br/>Donc, ici, les disciples ramassent la même chose qu’ils jettent les dés pour voir lequel des deux compagnons que Dieu avait choisi pour remplacer Judas Iscariot.<br/>le sort est tombé sur Matthias; il a été compté avec les onze (Actes 1:26).<br/>Maintenant, qui dans le monde est Matthias? Personne n'a jamais entendu parler de lui avant ou depuis. Il sera intéressant de rencontrer Matthias et de savoir qui il est et ce qu'il a fait. Je pense que de l'histoire ultérieure, il est évident de supposer que Dieu a choisi Paul comme apôtre. C’est la dernière fois que nous lisons qu’ils cherchent à discerner la volonté de Dieu par le tirage au sort ou par une sorte de hasard.<br/>Je sais qu’un homme aujourd’hui, en cherchant à discerner la volonté du Seigneur, priera et posera une question au Seigneur. Il aura dix sous dans sa poche, et pendant qu’il prie, il prendra les sous les yeux fermés et les posera sur la table, et s’ils remontent tous la tête, c’est un oui. Ce qui est intéressant, c'est que de temps en temps, ils se lèveront tous la tête, et c'est une très bonne chance. Une fois que le Saint-Esprit est venu sur l'église, alors le Saint-Esprit a commencé à leur parler et à les diriger. Et le Saint-Esprit a dit: "Séparez-moi Paul et Barnabas pour le ministère où je les ai appelés" (Actes 13:2). Et le Saint-Esprit les a envoyés. Ainsi, nous trouvons l’église plus directement guidée par le Saint-Esprit. Une fois que le Saint-Esprit est venu, ce coup de dés pour découvrir la volonté de Dieu a été mis de côté.<br/>"<br/><br/>Version du roi James<br/><br/>Il s'agit de la version du roi Jacques de 1769 de la Sainte Bible (également connue sous le nom de version autorisée). |

In fact, dynamic drivers work exactly the same as dynamic microphones but in reverse. Inside a dynamic driver there is a magnet, and when you plug in the headphones, you are sending a AC current through it which will turn the voice coil into a magnet. Depending on the direction of the current, the polarity of the magnet will change. Now since we know for a magnet, same charges repels and different charges attract, we know that the voice coil will move back and forth depending on it's polarity at the time. The voice coil is attached to the diaphragm which will then move back and forth creating a sound wave. The same occurs in reverse, if you move a coil through a magnet you produce a current instead. Since your voice is pushing the diaphragm, it is moving the voice coil back and forth generating the current you have observed.<br/><br/>100+ Head-Fier<br/><br/>Joined:<br/>Nov 7, 2011<br/><br/>Posts:<br/>134<br/><br/>Likes: 55<br/><br/>Exactly.

Stalin's opposition within the party, including Bukharin, Yagoda and Rykov were purged in these show trials, as Stalin manipulatively forced them to confess to crimes of planning a coup and opposing the state, even if there was no proof. Gabor T Rittersporn said, "Many of the victims were sincerely devoted to the principles of Bolshevism." This amplifies proof that the Bolshevik ideals that had once been the roots of the Communist Party were being disarranged and destroyed by the Purges. The party was depleted and former members helplessly watched Stalin use the great purge as a tool to transform Russia from a one party state to an unchallenged dictatorship. Again, the purges were shattering the framework of the Communist Party, formed during the Bolshevik revolution. This agrees with the "Stalin the executioner" source as both show the manipulative character, that helped the dictator to enhance his grip on Russia's throat.<br/>The manipulative manner, with which Stalin incriminated his targeted opposition during the purges, in the eyes of everyday Russians, also had an implosive impact on Soviet Society. Stalin was able to collect support from the people through his use of propaganda and the media to help him develop a "cult of personality" and the image of a heroic and brave leader. Through this support Stalin implanted mistrust into the minds of the people, convincing them that traitors of the revolution and what he described as 'enemies of the people', were amongst them.

Gabor T.

Le parti a été épuisé et les anciens membres ont vu Staline utiliser la grande purge comme un outil pour transformer la Russie d’un État à parti unique en une dictature incontestée.

| Supercell is nerfing brawlers instead of nerfing star powers. I was at 750 last season with power 8 nita and it is very tough to go past that, like, star powers play a really dominant role. The matchmaking is also trash. When i play gem grab(around 600 trophies), there are often matchups where the enemy team has one more player than us who is maxed and it's not even that we have a lvl 9 to compete versus that. Sometimes there are even matchups where the enemy team is fully maxed and none of us are. this is why i dont play brawl stars seriously anymore. It's not even like there arent many players who are not maxed and around 600 trophies. It's annoying.<br/>Edit: I think supercell should have at least a basic mechanism that takes the average of levels of brawlers when setting up matches.<br/><br/>Except trophies don't really indicate your skill. They indicate the skill of the teammates you are placed with. And I'm fine with playing against higher level brawlers, but when one team is all level 10 and the other team isn't, clearly it's unbalanced.<br/><br/>I reccomend getting some good friends to play with, me and 2 friends got my friends power 1 tick to rank 28 by playing gem grab with a certain composition all day and we made it without a single one of us being maxed with our brawlers.<br/><br/>I Know how you feel I used to have brawlers in high trophies with low level and it's to difficult to go more further and everything I was saying to myself "I want to have star powers" really supercell needs to make balance to the star powers or at least make a better matchmaking system.<br/><br/>I kinda feel this. I ain't as good at the game as you, but I got Emz to 500 at power 1 and the matchmaking was horrible. Maxed out players everywhere! And it didn't help that the majority of my teammates had around 5-8k trophies... I had to resort to solo showdown last minute because I can either ambush unsuspecting players or simply play a little aggressive at the right times. But I really wish that it could be a bit easier for people who want to push brawlers to really high trophy ranges without having the luxury of star powers.<br/><br/>Altho spike is still good without curveball. Curveball was just a help for hitting your shots more often as spike. But even before curveball was released, spike was a really strong brawler, so he will remain the same now.<br/><br/>I agree that they should have nerfed ambush, but I think they are trying to balance both Snappy Sniping and Ambush, as they are both getting merged with this change. She was becoming a little powerful, but still not nerf-worthy<br/><br/>I'm not sure about this, but now that Darryl got a noticeable buff, looking at their new stats, it looks like Darryl might overshadow Bull, as not only he can always deal more damage than Bull, he won't die as early anymore, so their survivability will be similar without star power (although Bull's survivability is still noticeably better than Darryl's if he had Tough Guy). Not only that, Darryl's super can auto regenerate, meaning Darryl MIGHT be able to be played effectively both as a heavyweight AND an assassin at the same time (before he sucks as a heavyweight but decent as an assassin)<br/><br/>But hes overrated af. And you get trophies with him really easily. So im kinda ok with the nerf. I havent even played him since when I got him to 500 (around 5 months ago), so not that I care that much either.<br/><br/>Why doesn't Poco/Penny get a HP nerf, if they are Marksman/Healer respectively not a tank?<br/>Why isn't Rosa's tankyness nerfed, cough 70% damage reduction?<br/>Why is Tick allowed to have the highest range and the most free pokedamage in the entire game?<br/>Why doesn't Leon get a HP/Damage buff?<br/><br/>Be that as it may, it was Ambush that was OP, not base Piper. I would argue that Ambush is the best star power in the game (now even more so since the percentage of damage increase indirectly went up) and base Piper was a bottom-10 brawler.<br/><br/>What Supercell should do is revert both nerfs, reduce Ambush to 600, and reduce Snappy Sniping to 0.25 since it'd be indirectly buffed by the base damage buff.<br/><br/>Yea and I believe they went a bit too far with Rosa, because now she is basically the better bull now when it comes to tanking, which she has been for a while. Now, Darryl might as well be a smaller, more powerful bull<br/><br/>Why? I feel she needs a buff in almost everything except her star power. Her health and speed make her super a bit more difficult to use, because she can die pretty easily, and it is really difficult for her to trap faster brawlers like Crow. Her star power is a bit broken though... | Supercell est nerfing bagarreurs au lieu de nerfing étoiles pouvoirs. J'étais à 750 la saison dernière avec la puissance 8 nita et il est très difficile d'aller au-delà que, comme, les pouvoirs des étoiles jouent un rôle vraiment dominant. Le matchmaking est aussi poubelle. Lorsque je joue au gem grab (environ 600 trophées), il y a souvent des matchs où l'équipe ennemie a un joueur de plus que nous qui est maxed et ce n'est même pas que nous avons un lvl 9 pour rivaliser contre cela. Parfois, il y a même des affrontements où l'équipe ennemie est au maximum et aucun d'entre nous ne l'est. C'est pourquoi je ne joue plus sérieusement aux stars de la bagarre. Ce n'est même pas comme s'il n'y avait pas beaucoup de joueurs qui ne sont pas au maximum et environ 600 trophées. C'est ennuyeux.<br/>Edit: Je pense que supercell devrait avoir au moins un mécanisme de base qui prend la moyenne des niveaux de bagarreurs lors de la mise en place des matchs.<br/><br/>Sauf que les trophées n'indiquent pas vraiment votre habileté. Ils indiquent l'habileté des coéquipiers avec lesquels vous êtes placé. Et je suis d'accord pour jouer contre des bagarreurs de niveau supérieur, mais quand une équipe est de niveau 10 et que l'autre ne l'est pas, c'est clairement déséquilibré.<br/><br/>Je recommande d'avoir de bons amis avec qui jouer, moi et 2 amis avons obtenu que mes amis se classent au 28ème rang en jouant au gem grab avec une certaine composition toute la journée et nous l'avons fait sans qu'un seul d'entre nous soit maxed avec nos bagarreurs.<br/><br/>Je sais comment vous pensez que j'avais l'habitude d'avoir des bagarreurs dans des trophées de haut niveau avec un niveau bas et c'est difficile d'aller plus loin et tout ce que je me disais "je veux avoir des pouvoirs stellaires" a vraiment besoin de supercell pour équilibrer les pouvoirs stellaires ou au moins faire un meilleur système de matchmaking.<br/><br/>Je ne suis pas aussi bon au jeu que vous, mais j'ai eu Emz à 500 à la puissance 1 et le matchmaking était horrible. Maxed joueurs partout! Et il n'a pas aidé que la majorité de mes coéquipiers avaient environ 5-8k trophées... J’ai dû recourir à la confrontation en solo à la dernière minute parce que je peux tendre une embuscade à des joueurs sans méfiance ou simplement jouer un peu agressif au bon moment. Mais j'aimerais vraiment que ce soit un peu plus facile pour les gens qui veulent pousser les bagarreurs à des gammes de trophées très élevées sans avoir le luxe des pouvoirs des étoiles.<br/><br/>Altho pointe est toujours bon sans curveball. Curveball était juste une aide pour frapper vos coups plus souvent comme pic. Mais avant même que curveball a été libéré, pic était un bagarreur très fort, donc il restera le même maintenant.<br/><br/>Je suis d'accord qu'ils auraient dû nerf embuscade, mais je pense qu'ils essaient d'équilibrer à la fois Snappy Sniping et Ambush, car ils sont tous deux se fondre avec ce changement. Elle devenait un peu puissant, mais toujours pas nerf digne<br/><br/>Je ne suis pas sûr à ce sujet, mais maintenant que Darryl a un buff notable, en regardant leurs nouvelles statistiques, il semble que Darryl pourrait éclipser Bull, car non seulement il peut toujours infliger plus de dégâts que Bull, il ne mourra plus aussi tôt, donc leur survie sera similaire sans Star Power (bien que la survie de Bull soit encore nettement meilleure que celle de Darryl s'il avait Tough Guy). Non seulement cela, le super Darryl peut se régénérer automatiquement, ce qui signifie que Darryl peut être joué efficacement à la fois comme un poids lourd ET un assassin en même temps (avant qu'il ne suce comme un poids lourd mais décent comme un assassin).<br/><br/>Mais il est surestimé af. Et vous obtenez des trophées avec lui très facilement. Donc je suis un peu d'accord avec le nerf. Je ne l'ai même pas joué depuis quand je l'ai amené à 500 (il y a environ 5 mois), donc pas que je m'en soucie beaucoup non plus.<br/><br/>Pourquoi Poco/Penny n'obtiennent-ils pas un nerf HP, s'ils sont respectivement Marksman/Healer et pas un tank ?<br/>Pourquoi la tankyness de Rosa n'est-elle pas nervurée, ne tousse-t-elle pas avec une réduction de 70% des dégâts ?<br/>Pourquoi Tick est-il autorisé à avoir le plus haut rang et le plus de dégâts de poke dans tout le jeu?<br/>Pourquoi Leon n'a-t-il pas de buff HP/Damage ?<br/><br/>Quoi qu'il en soit, c'était Ambush qui était OP, pas Piper de base. Je dirais que Ambush est la meilleure puissance étoile dans le jeu (maintenant encore plus depuis le pourcentage d'augmentation des dégâts indirectement augmenté) et Piper de base était un bagarreur du bas-10.<br/><br/>Ce que Supercell devrait faire, c'est rétablir les deux nerfs, réduire Ambush à 600 et réduire Snappy Sniping à 0,25 car il serait indirectement amélioré par le buff de dégâts de base.<br/><br/>Oui et je crois qu'ils sont allés un peu trop loin avec Rosa, parce que maintenant elle est fondamentalement le meilleur taureau maintenant quand il s'agit de tanking, ce qu'elle a été pendant un certain temps. Maintenant, Darryl pourrait aussi bien être un taureau plus petit, plus puissant<br/><br/>Sa santé et sa vitesse la rendent un peu plus difficile à utiliser, car elle peut mourir assez facilement, et il est vraiment difficile pour elle de piéger des bagarreurs plus rapides comme Crow. Son pouvoir d'étoile est un peu cassé cependant... |

| Self-Employment Part 1<br/><br/>When you accept an employment in any organisation, you have to perform various jobs as per the requirements of your employer and you may get a fixed amount of income as salary. You may run a small retail shop, tailoring shop, restaurant, bakery and confectionery, beauty salon, etc. in your locality. You may get engaged in trading or manufacturing on a small scale or providing some service for a price. Such economic activities are known as self-employment.<br/><br/>Meaning of Self-Employment<br/><br/>Earning is necessary for a living. Our father, mother, brothers, sisters and others may be engaged in different economic activities through which they earn their livelihood. These persons are engaged in an economic activity which is termed as wage employment or paid employment. But there are many persons who engage themselves in an occupation or some business which they start and manage on their own. They put in their best effort and take all types of risks to pursue their careers successfully. The entire earning of their work goes to them. All of us have seen small grocery shops, tailoring shops, medical stores etc. in our locality. These are owned and managed by a person, with or without the help of some assistants. Their economic activities are termed as self-employment. So, when an individual engages in any economic activity and manages it on his own, it is known as self-employment.<br/><br/>Objectives<br/><br/>After studying this lesson, you will be able to:<br/><br/>Image of Objectives<br/><br/>Image of Objectives<br/><br/>Characteristics of Self-Employment<br/><br/>It involves ownership and management of activities by a person although he/she may take the help of one or two persons to assist him/her. Thus, self-employment may provide employment to other persons as well.<br/><br/>The earning from self-employment is not fixed. It depends on the income one can earn by producing or buying and selling goods or providing services to others at a price.<br/><br/>In self-employment, the owner alone has to take the profit and bear the risk of loss. So, we find a direct link between the effort and reward in self-employment.<br/><br/>It requires some amount of capital investment, although it may be small.<br/><br/>In self-employment, a person is free to take decisions in respect of running his business profitably and avail of any opportunity that may come up for expansion of his business. It gives complete freedom to work as per one's own will and within the parameters of the prevailing laws.<br/><br/>Thus, self-employment may be defined as, an economic activity which one may perform on his own as a gainful occupation, and this may consist of producing and selling goods, buying and selling goods, or rendering services for a price. | Travail indépendant Partie 1<br/><br/>Lorsque vous acceptez un emploi dans une organisation, vous devez effectuer divers emplois selon les exigences de votre employeur et vous pouvez obtenir un montant fixe de revenus en tant que salaire. Vous pouvez gérer un petit magasin de détail, un magasin de couture, un restaurant, une boulangerie et une confiserie, un salon de beauté, etc. dans votre localité. Vous pouvez vous engager dans le commerce ou la fabrication à petite échelle ou fournir un service pour un prix. Ces activités économiques sont connues sous le nom de travail indépendant.<br/><br/>Signification du travail indépendant<br/><br/>Notre père, notre mère, nos frères, nos sœurs et d’autres personnes peuvent être engagés dans différentes activités économiques grâce auxquelles ils gagnent leur vie. Ces personnes exercent une activité économique appelée emploi salarié ou salarié, mais il y a beaucoup de personnes qui exercent une profession ou une entreprise qu'elles créent et gèrent elles-mêmes. Ils font de leur mieux et prennent tous les types de risques pour poursuivre leur carrière avec succès. L'intégralité de leur travail leur revient. Nous avons tous vu de petites épiceries, des ateliers de couture, des magasins médicaux, etc. dans notre localité. Ceux-ci sont détenus et gérés par une personne, avec ou sans l'aide de certains assistants. Leurs activités économiques sont appelées travail indépendant. Ainsi, lorsqu'un individu se livre à une activité économique et la gère seul, il est connu comme travail indépendant.<br/><br/>Objectifs<br/><br/>Après avoir étudié cette leçon, vous serez en mesure de:<br/><br/>Image des objectifs<br/><br/>Image des objectifs<br/><br/>Caractéristiques du travail indépendant<br/><br/>Il s'agit de la propriété et de la gestion des activités d'une personne, bien qu'elle puisse demander l'aide d'une ou deux personnes pour l'aider, de sorte que le travail indépendant peut également fournir un emploi à d'autres personnes.<br/><br/>Le revenu du travail indépendant n'est pas fixe, il dépend du revenu que l'on peut gagner en produisant ou en achetant et en vendant des biens ou en fournissant des services à d'autres à un prix.<br/><br/>Dans le travail indépendant, le propriétaire doit prendre seul le profit et supporter le risque de perte. Ainsi, nous trouvons un lien direct entre l'effort et la récompense dans le travail indépendant.<br/><br/>Il nécessite un certain montant d'investissement en capital, bien qu'il puisse être faible.<br/><br/>Dans le travail indépendant, une personne est libre de prendre des décisions en ce qui concerne la gestion rentable de son entreprise et de profiter de toute occasion qui pourrait se présenter pour l'expansion de son entreprise. Il donne une liberté totale de travailler selon sa propre volonté et dans les paramètres des lois en vigueur.<br/><br/>Ainsi, le travail indépendant peut être défini comme une activité économique que l'on peut exercer seul comme une occupation lucrative, et cela peut consister à produire et à vendre des biens, à acheter et à vendre des biens ou à rendre des services à un prix. |
