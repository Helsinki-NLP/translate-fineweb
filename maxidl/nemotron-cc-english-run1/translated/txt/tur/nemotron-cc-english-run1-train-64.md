| Smith Chuck - Through the Bible C2000 SeriesShall we turn to the book of Acts, chapter one, as we begin our study of the early church.<br/>Luke, the author of the book of Acts, a companion of Paul the apostle, who was author also of the Gospel According to Luke, wrote these two treatises to a friend, Theophilus. Theophilus is a Greek name. It's a name that has a beautiful meaning. The name means lover of God. There are some who believe that it was not a man at all, but that the gospel and the book of Acts were addressed to the lovers of God, whoever you may be. There are other traditions that say that Theophilus was actually Luke's master. That in those days physicians were slaves, usually the slave of a wealthy patron. So that Luke's master was Theophilus, and he released Luke to be with Paul on the missionary journeys. Thus, Luke is writing back to his former master. This is an early tradition of the church, but it is, of course, impossible to prove, like so many of the traditions.<br/>There are also those who believe that when Paul was in Troas and he received a vision of a man calling unto him saying, "Come over to Macedonia and help us," that that man in Paul's vision was none other than Luke. For the first one that Paul really met when he came to Macedonia was Luke. And as we are in the book of Acts, you will find that when we get to that portion of the book of Acts, Luke begins to write more in the first person rather than the third person. So it is, evidently, at this particular point in the Acts of the Apostles that Luke became a companion of Paul and began to journey with him. He began to use the pronouns "we" and "us" instead of "they" and "them." This is, no doubt, where Luke became a participant and an eyewitness of those things that were happening from this point on. We will bring this out to you when we get to that point.<br/>He begins the Acts of the Apostles by tying it with the Gospel According to Luke. It is interesting that the very last thing that Luke records in his gospel is the very first thing he records in the Acts of the Apostles. We find the gospel of Luke closing as Jesus is telling His disciples to wait in Jerusalem until they be endued with power from on high. And then Jesus ascended up into heaven, and so he closes the gospel. In opening the Acts of the Apostles, he writes,<br/>The former treatise [that is, the Gospel According to Luke,] have I written unto you, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and teach ( Act 1:1 ),<br/>The key word is began. The Gospel According to Luke is not the full story of the ministry of Jesus Christ. It is only the beginning of the ministry of Jesus Christ. Jesus continues to minister to the needs of people. Jesus continues to heal the sick. Jesus continues to raise the dead. Jesus continues to minister His love and His gospel to the world, only now He is ministering through those disciples who have been anointed with His Holy Spirit. But the ministry of Christ is continuing; basically, is the premise that Luke takes in the Acts of the Apostles. The former treatise of all that Jesus began, both to do and to teach.<br/>Now because of that, the Acts of the Apostles is an unfinished book: in that the Lord today continues to work through the lives of those who have dedicated themselves to be the instruments of God. To be led and guided and anointed by His Holy Spirit, to continue the ministry of Jesus in the world today. Now God has ordained that His work should be accomplished through human instruments. I do not say that it must be accomplished. God can use angelic beings for His work, and there will come a time, during the book of Revelation when God will use angels to proclaim His gospel to people all over the world. Revelation, chapter 14, "The first angel flying through the midst of heaven having the everlasting gospel" ( Rev 14:6 ). But at the present time, God has chosen to use human instruments. As imperfect as they may be, yet that's what God has ordained to use. The exciting thing about that is, God will use me and God will use you. So many times, we're begging off, "O Lord, I can't speak. I've never been able to speak before or even now, Lord." As Moses tried to beg off the call of God. Jeremiah said, "Lord, I'm just a kid; no one's going to listen to me." And we all have our excuses why we can't be used. Don't we? We all know the reasons why God couldn't use us.<br/>One time, as the Lord was calling a prophet to do His work, he said, "Lord, send whoever you want." The Lord said, "Hey, I've called you." "Lord, good idea; send whoever you want." So often we're in that position, "Lord, send by the hand of whomsoever you will, anybody but me Lord." And yet, God has ordained to use us.<br/>Now, each of us can show our own imperfections. Each of us can point out our own inabilities, and all of us can find an excuse why God wouldn't want to use me. But yet, God has chosen to use you. That through your life He might reveal Himself to a needy world. You wonder when God has such instruments to use how He ever got the job done, don't you?<br/>Until the day in which he was taken up, after that he through the Holy Spirit had given commandments to the apostles whom he had chosen ( Act 1:2 ):<br/>That is what he ended the Gospel of Luke with. The day that Jesus was taken up, after He had told the apostles to wait for the endowment of power.<br/>To whom he also [that is the apostles he also] showed himself alive to them after his passion [or death] by many infallible proofs ( Act 1:3 ),<br/>It is difficult to deny the fact of the resurrection of Jesus Christ. I was amused, as well as annoyed and irritated, by an article I read in the Santa Ana Register this last Saturday. Of the creation science and evolutionary theories being presented in the county schools. How that, this one professor said that he teaches a science class, and thus, they deal only in facts, and that they don't have any place for theories. Because science is based upon fact and creation is based upon religious superstitions. It takes a lot of faith to believe the religious theories. When you are dealing with facts, you can just accept them. I thought, "Very interesting in that science class, they taught me it was a fact that the world was four billion years old. Now today they are teaching it's a fact that the world is twelve billion years old. And it wasn't that long ago that I went to school."<br/>It's interesting that the Bible has never needed to be revised or updated to meet the current data that men have discovered. And yet, if you would take my high school science textbooks today and try to teach a science class from them, you would find that many of the things that were taught as scientific fact when I was in high school are no longer recognized as scientific fact. The simple cell protoplasm is no longer a simple cell, but extremely complex. If there is any fact that can be attested to in history it is the fact of the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.<br/>We have a jurisprudence system that is based upon the testimony of witnesses. If a man is accused of a crime and there are people who witnessed that crime while it was being committed, and they are brought to the standard, and they swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help them God. And in their questioning they affirm that, "I saw that man in the bank on May twenty-third. I saw him pull out a gun from his coat. I heard him demand that all of the money be given to him. I saw him as he left the bank. I saw him as the officer apprehended him outside." And if you can get three or four witnesses to point to that man and will keep their testimony under cross-examination, that man is judged to be guilty. He is the one who did it. We have two or three witnesses that are testifying the same story about that man, and it is accepted as fact that he is the one who perpetrated the crime and is guilty. You've got witnesses who have sworn to tell the truth that are verifying.<br/>After the death of Jesus, when He rose again, He appeared unto many different people who gave sworn testimony that they saw Him. That they talked to Him, that He appeared to them in various places under different circumstances. And for a period of forty days was visiting with them. And at one time, up to as many as five hundred people who were gathered at one place, He appeared. It's difficult to just cast aside or deny the witness of these people. To do so is to discredit our whole jurisprudence system. But not only that, these men who testified that they saw the risen Lord, that they talked to Him, that they ate with Him, they, all of them, with the exception of one, met violent deaths at the hands of other people because of their affirming that the story they told was true. You talk about witnesses sworn to tell the truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth. If a person's life was threatened because of that witness, and it was a lie, at least one them would've broken under the pressure. They would've confessed to the entire hoax. "He showed Himself alive after His passion by many infallible proofs."<br/>being seen of them for forty days, speaking to them of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God ( Act 1:3 ):<br/>Sometimes we fault the disciples because of their questions of the timing of the kingdom of God. Let it be remembered that the kingdom of God was the favorite subject of Jesus Christ. He was always talking about the kingdom of God, and it is a great hope that He was planting into the hearts of all men. Things are not always going to continue corrupted as they are. The world is not going to go forever under the power of darkness, under the bondage of evil. God is going to one day establish His kingdom upon the earth. A kingdom of righteous joy and peace. "Jesus shall reign, where ere the sun doth her successive journeys run. And His kingdom will extend from shore to shore." And that day will be the most glorious day the world has ever seen, as sickness and suffering and pain will be abolished in His kingdom. As sin and greed and these things that have made the world such an intolerable place will be abolished in His kingdom. The godless commercialism, the exploitation of man, all of these things abolished in His glorious kingdom when He reigns. No wonder the disciples were anxious to get it on. I'm anxious to get it on; I'm anxious for His kingdom to come. And Jesus told us when we pray, the first petition is, "Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven" ( Mat 6:10 ). This is the right kind of a desire that we should all have. I desire the kingdom of God. And so He was talking to them, during this forty-day period, of the kingdom.<br/>And, being assembled together with them, he commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which, saith he, you have heard of me ( Act 1:4 ).<br/>He said, "Now look, wait here in Jerusalem until you receive the promise of the Father." This promise that He is referring to is, no doubt, the promise in Joel where the Lord promised, "And it shall come to pass in the later days, saith the Lord, that I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and daughters will prophesy, and your young men shall dream dreams, your old men shall see visions: and upon my servants and my handmaidens shall I pour out my Spirit, saith the Lord" ( Joe 2:28-29 ). The promise of the Father: the day is going to come when God is going to pour out His Spirit upon all flesh, all of the believers. They will, each one, receive that dynamic from God.<br/>For John [He said,] truly baptized with water; but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now ( Act 1:5 ).<br/>The idea of baptism was that of emersion, the bapteedzo. John baptized with water, submerged the people in water, "you're going to be submerged in the Holy Spirit in not many days."<br/>Now when they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, will you at this time restore the kingdom to Israel? ( Act 1:6 )<br/>"When is it going to be, Lord? When's the time for this restoration?" And Jesus is talking to them now, not about the kingdom, but about the power that they're going to receive for service. And so He brushes aside their question.<br/>Saying unto them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father has put in his own power ( Act 1:7 ).<br/>"It's not for you to know." They lived constantly in the anticipation of the immediate setting up of the kingdom. During the entire lifetime of Jesus, they were expecting Him at any moment to go into the phone booth and come out as the savior of the world. Shazzam! Showing His power and overthrowing the governments of the world, establishing God's kingdom upon the earth. And they were waiting daily for this change to transpire. And whenever Jesus would talk about going to Jerusalem, being turned over into the hands of sinful man, and then being crucified, "Oh, oh no, Lord. No, no you don't understand the kingdom, Lord. Be that far from Thee." When Jesus died on the cross, they were all greatly disappointed.<br/>The two disciples on the road to Emmaus, so sad. "Hey, fellows. How come you're so sad as your walking along?" "What do you mean? You must be a stranger around here if you don't know the things that have been happening lately in Jerusalem." "What things?" "Oh, a fellow by the name of Jesus of Nazareth...oh man, it was mighty and powerful. The anointing of God was upon His life. We had hoped that in Him was the deliverance of Israel, but they crucified Him. We had hoped . . . now it's dead." Now He's risen, and He's saying, "In a few days, fellows, you're going to receive the promise of the Father." "Oh, what promise? The promise of the establishing of the kingdom?" You see, it was legitimate that they should ask. "Is this it Lord? Alright! Is this the time? Are you going to set up your kingdom now?" "No. It's not for you to know those times that the Father's appointed or that the Father has in His own power. But, you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you."<br/>Now here, the Greek preposition epi is used to signify a new relationship that they were to have with the Holy Spirit. In the Gospel According to John, chapter 14, as Jesus is there promising to send the Holy Spirit, He said, "I will not leave you comfortless. I will come to you, and I will pray the Father, and He will send to you another comforter, even the Spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth Him not neither knows Him, but you know Him for He dwells with you, and He shall be in you" ( Joh 14:17-18 ). Same Greek preposition as ours, only they spell it "en" instead of "in." Two-fold relationship there in John: He is with you, but He's going to be dwelling in you. But now Jesus said you're going to receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you. The Greek preposition epi, which is translated in different texts throughout the New Testament as "upon" or "over" or I like it, "overflows."<br/>In the seventh chapter of the gospel of John: "On the last day, the great day of the feast when Jesus stood there on the Temple Mount and cried to the people, 'If any man thirst let him come unto Me and drink: and he who drinks of the water that I give, out of his innermost being there will gush torrents of living water.'" John said, "This spake He of the Spirit, which was not yet given which they who believe on Him should receive" ( Joh 7:37-39 ). What did He speak of the Spirit? That it would be like a torrent of living water flowing out. I like, "When the Spirit overflows you," upon you, or over you, or overflows from you. So the three-fold relationship: He is with you prior to your conversion, He is the one who causes you to realize that you are a sinner, He is the one who points to Jesus Christ as the answer as He convinces the world of sin, of righteous, and of judgment. The moment you open your life and heart to Jesus Christ and invite Him to come in, the Holy Spirit comes and begins to indwell you. He shall be in you. "Know ye not that you are not your own, you have been bought with a price, therefore glorify God in your body and your spirit which are His. And know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit which is in you? Be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess, but be filled, or be ye being filled with the Spirit" ( 1Co 6:19-20 ,Eph 5:18 ). But now here's a third relationship. This is an empowering experience.<br/>You will receive [the dunamus] the dynamics, when the Holy Spirit has come [epi] upon you [or over you, or when there is that overflow from you]: and ye shall be witnesses unto me ( Act 1:8 )<br/>And so the dynamic, to be a witness for Jesus Christ. It is interesting that the word witness in Greek is the word martus from where we get our word martyr. And in Greek it does mean martyr. A witness is one who not only proclaims what he believes, he lives what he believes, he is what he believes, and he believes it so strongly, that if necessary, he'll die for what he believes. That's how strong is his belief. He's a martus. You can't stop him. He's not afraid to die for what he believes.<br/>You remember when Paul was on his way back to Jerusalem and Agabus came down from Caesarea and he took Paul's girdle and tied himself up and he said, "So is the man who owns this girdle to be bound when he gets to Jerusalem." And Paul's friends began to weep, saying, "Oh, Paul, don't go, don't go." And he said, "What do you mean by these tears? Do you think you're going to dissuade me? Do you think I'm worried about being bound? I'm ready to die." He was a martus. "I'm ready to die." Being put to death for your faith did not make you a martyr; because you were a martyr, you were put to death. Because you were a witness, because you believed it so strong. So, it did not make you a witness, it only proved what you were. You were a witness all along. If you hadn't been a martus, you would've never gone to your death. You would've recanted; you would've said, "Whoa, whoa, wait, wait. Hold on, let's change course here. I think that I may have made a mistake." Then you say, "Well, he wasn't a martus. Stealing a horse doesn't make you a horse thief; it only proves that you were. No one steals a horse unless he's a horse thief. So, stealing it doesn't make you a horse thief, it only proves that you were all along. Being martyred only proves what you were a witness, a martus. "And you will be witnesses." And isn't it interesting that most of them were martyred? "Witnesses unto Me."<br/>The witness was to be both in Jerusalem, and in all of Judea ( Act 1:8 ),<br/>The witness began right at home. The hardest place, isn't it? It's to start right at home in Jerusalem, and then the area around Jerusalem, the area of Judea. And then it was to spread up into Samaria. And then it was to go out into the uttermost parts of the world. And as we study the book of Acts, we will see this very progression. How the witness began in Jerusalem. We'll get that in the next chapter. And then we'll see how it began to spread through out Judea. And then Phillip went up into Samaria, and then finally Paul and Barnabas are called to go into the uttermost parts of the world. And so the witness spread through the anointing and the empowering of the Holy Spirit.<br/>Now when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight ( Act 1:9 ).<br/>This is the final promise made by Jesus to His disciples. This is it, the final words prior to His ascension. Of course, later He came and talked to Paul and others, but prior to His ascension, this is His final word. And upon this, when He had spoken these things, while they were watching Him, He was taken up and a cloud received Him out of their sight.<br/>And while they were looking steadfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, there were two men who stood by them in white apparel ( Act 1:10 );<br/>We assume they were angels.<br/>Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as you have seen him go into heaven ( Act 1:11 ).<br/>They saw Him as He ascended up into heaven and they will behold Him when He comes again. "Behold the Lord cometh with ten thousands of His saints, to execute judgement upon the earth" (Jud 1:14-15). And then, "Unto Him who loved us and gave Himself for us and who has made us unto our God, kings and priests who shall reign with Him upon the earth, behold the Lord cometh, and every eye shall see Him, and they also who pierced Him shall mourn" Rev 1:5-7 ). So the Lord's coming. Every eye shall see Him. The Jehovah Witnesses say that He is already come, but it was a secret coming. As it was only the disciples that saw Him go, it was only the disciples, of the Jehovah Witnesses, who saw Him return. But Jesus said, "If they say unto you, 'He has come in secret and has gone into a secret chamber don't believe it'" ( Mat 24:26 ). So you have to choose, to believe Jesus or them.<br/>"This same Jesus which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as you've seen Him go into heaven."<br/>Now there's a very interesting verse in II John, verse Act 1:7 , "For many deceivers are entered into the world who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh." That, unfortunately, is a poor translation of the Greek. For this participle is in the present tense and should be translated "is coming in the flesh." Those who would deny that Jesus Christ is coming in the flesh. What does John say of them? "They are a deceiver and an antichrist. Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward. For whosoever transgresses and abides not in the doctrine of Christ, has not God. He that abides in the doctrine of Christ, he has both the Father and the Son. And if there come any unto your door (on Saturday morning) and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, and neither bid him good-bye. For he that bids him good-bye is a partaker of his evil deeds" (2Jn 1:7-11). Ask them one question, "Is Jesus coming in the flesh?" Just ask them that question. And if they say no, just remember what John warned you and what John told you. "If any confess not that Jesus Christ is coming in the flesh." Do you remember when He was with the disciples and He said, "Give me something to eat"? He said, "You know, spirits don't eat; touch me. See? It's me." So, this same Jesus is coming again in the same manner in which they saw Him go into heaven. And I, for one, believe that that coming is very soon.<br/>Then retuned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a Sabbath's day journey [about two-thirds of a mile]. And when they were come in, they went up into an upper room, where there abode both Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, and Phillip, and Thomas, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon Zelotes, and Judas the brother of James. And these all continued in one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers ( Act 1:12-14 ).<br/>This is the last mention of Mary the mother of Jesus. At this point and from this point on, there is no further mention of her in the Acts of the Apostles or in the epistles. No mention of her death or of her miraculous ascension into heaven, without death. Nothing is mentioned in the scripture. It is silent.<br/>His brethren would be a reference probably to James and to Jude and to those other brothers who were sons of Joseph and Mary.<br/>The upper room--there are some who say that it is the same upper room in which Jesus had the Last Supper with His disciples. And yet, there are others who hold to this upper room being a room in the temple precincts where the early church met. Take your choice.<br/>And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples, and said, (the number of their names together were about one hundred and twenty,) men and brethren, this Scripture must needs have been fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit by the mouth of David spake before concerning Judas, which was a guide to those who took Jesus ( Act 1:15-16 ).<br/>Here again, Peter still his same impetuous self. They're waiting in prayer and supplication, and Peter stands up and says, "Fellows, there's a scripture that's gotta be fulfilled." And you know he's going to move ahead, "Let's get the program going; let's cast lots and find out who's going to take Judas' place." I do feel that Peter was again in the flesh, manifesting that impetuous nature that was his. And I think that the future history of the church in the book of Acts points this out. I am interested in Peter's understanding of the scriptures, how that he is quoting from so many places in the Old Testament. Peter does manifest a very great understanding of the Old Testament scriptures which is a point in his favor.<br/>Notice that Peter ascribes to the Holy Spirit those things that David wrote. So that, "All scripture is given by inspiration of God" ( 2Ti 3:16 ). Not part of the scriptures. Because, if you tell me that part of the scriptures are given by inspiration of God, then I must ask you, "What parts are by inspiration and what parts are not by inspiration?" And then you are then the authority who tells me what part I can believe and what part I can't believe. And the minute that God is no longer the authority but you're the authority, I'm in trouble. Beware of those who say, "Well, you can't believe all of the scriptures." The scriptures themselves say, "All scripture is given by inspiration of God." And here, Luke in writing of what Peter was saying, declares that David was actually the spokesman for the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit, by the mouth of David, spake concerning Judas.<br/>For he was numbered with us, [he was one of the twelve] he had obtained a part of this ministry. But now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity; and falling headlong ( Act 1:17-18 ),<br/>He purchased the field, the potter's field as Zachariah the eleventh chapter declares.<br/>and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all of his bowels gushed out ( Act 1:18 ).<br/>There are those who find a discrepancy in the scriptures, because in one of the gospels we are told that when Judas came back and tried to return the money, and they said, "Hey, it's your problem. We can't take it." And put it back in the temple treasury. "It's blood money." Then he threw it there on the floor of the temple and he went out and hung himself. Here Peter tells us that he fell headlong and just popped. And there are those who imagine a discrepancy. Very simple, he went up into the tree to hang himself, tied the rope around his neck and tied it to the limb and jumped. And the force of the fall either snapped the rope or his head, and he fell on down into the canyon and just as he said it here.<br/>It was known to all of the dwellers at Jerusalem; insomuch that the field is called in their tongue, Aceldama, that is to say, The field of blood. For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be desolate, and let no man dwell therein: and, His bishoprick let another take ( Act 1:19-20 ).<br/>Now in reality he's quoting from two different Psalms here. From Psa 69:25 ,he puts it together with Psa 109:8 . And putting the two together he finds these prophecies concerning Judas.<br/>Wherefore of these men ( Act 1:21 )<br/>Now here is where they are looking for someone to take Judas' place to be an apostle. Here are the qualifications they looked for in that time.<br/>Wherefore of these men which have companied with us all the time that the Lord Jesus when in and out among us ( Act 1:21 ),<br/>Now you remember there were many disciples, many disciples of which Jesus chose ten to be apostles. And the word apostle means "one who is sent out." Or chose twelve to be apostles, so He sent out the twelve. The number of human government. "We only have eleven. We need one to take Judas' place, but we need one who has been with us all the while from the beginning with Jesus."<br/>From the time he was baptized by John, until the day he was taken up from us, must one be ordained to be a witness [of what?] of His resurrection ( Act 1:22 ).<br/>So these were the requirements they were looking for. Someone who had been around the whole while. From the time of John's baptism to the ascension. And one who saw the risen Lord, and thus could bear fact of the resurrection, their testimony to the fact.<br/>Now Paul the apostle, later in asserting the fact that he was an apostle said, "Have I not seen the risen Christ?" Evidently that was one of the requirements of apostleship. Someone asked me, "Are there apostles today?" Well, I don't know. I don't think that there are in the same sense that they were in the New Testament. Surely there is none today who can bear witness to the resurrection as they did.<br/>They appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias. And they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord, which knowest the hearts of all men, show whether of these two that you have chosen ( Act 1:23-24 ),<br/>I think that we often make this mistake of giving the Lord two choices, both wrong. Limiting God, you see. We're so prone to do this. Obviously, Paul was God's choice. Peter was impetuous, and jumping the gun said, "Hey, we've got to do something, you know, gotta help God out. You know, one's missing and we've got to fill him in." And yet, "God, which one of these two do you want?" And giving God the two choices.<br/>That he may take part of this ministry and this apostleship, from which Judas by the transgression fell, that he might go to his own place. And so they gave forth their lots ( Act 1:25-26 );<br/>An interesting way by which they sought to determine the will of God. Let's throw dice, find out what God's will is here. It's interesting to me, the various ways that people have devised to discern the will of God. Now, in the Old Testament times they had an interesting way of coming to the priest, who would inquire of the Lord for them through the Urim and the Thummim, the "lights and perfections." Just what these Urim and Thummim were, we don't know. I'm sure they were not the colored glasses that Joseph Smith found with the Golden Tablets; the magic glasses, that when you put them on, you could suddenly read the hieroglyphic writing.<br/>There are those who say that the Urim and Thummim were actually a black and a white stone that was worn in a pouch on the chest of the priest. They would pray and ask the Lord a particular question. You remember that David was asking the Lord definite questions: "Lord, shall we go out against the Philistines?" The answer was, "No." So again, the next day, "Lord, shall we go out against the Philistines?" The answer was, "Yes." "When shall we go?" They would ask specific questions, and the Lord would direct them through the Urim and the Thummin. They say that the priest would pray, seek God, and then reach in and pull out one of the two stones. If it was the white stone, it was a yes answer. If it was a no, then it would be the black stone that he would pull out. Some even say we get the term blackballed from this Urim and Thummim. Actually, back in the original it is a no vote against a particular project or idea. Just what the Urim and Thummim were, we don't know. But during the Old Testament period, they did use a method of casting lots to determine the will of God.<br/>So here the disciples are picking up on the same thing as they are throwing the dice to see which of the two fellows that God had chosen to replace Judas Iscariot.<br/>the lot fell on Matthias; he was numbered with the eleven ( Act 1:26 ).<br/>Now who in the world is Matthias? No one ever heard of him before or since. It'll be interesting to meet Matthias and find out who he is and what he did. I think from the subsequent history, it's obvious to assume that God chose Paul as an apostle. Paul declares it himself. Now this is the last time we ever read of them seeking to discern the will of God by the casting of lots or by a chance kind of a thing.<br/>I know a fellow today, in seeking to discern the will of the Lord, will pray and ask the Lord a question. He'll have ten pennies in his pocket, and as he's praying, he'll take the pennies with his eyes closed and put them down on the table, and if they all come up heads, it's a yes. An interesting thing, every once in a while, they'll all come up heads, and that's pretty good odds. Yet, we don't find any pattern for this after the Holy Spirit was given. Once the Holy Spirit came upon the church, then the Holy Spirit began to speak to them and direct them. And the Holy Spirit said, "Separate unto me Paul and Barnabas for the ministry where I have called them" ( Act 13:2 ). And the Holy Spirit sent them forth. So we find the church more directly guided by the Holy Spirit. Once the Holy Spirit came, this throwing dice to find out the will of God was set aside.<br/>"<br/><br/>King James Version<br/><br/>This is the 1769 King James Version of the Holy Bible (also known as the Authorized Version). "Public Domain" | Smith Chuck - Kutsal Kitap C2000 Serisi aracılığıyla, ilk kilise çalışmamıza başlarken, birinci bölüm olan Elçilerin İşleri kitabına başvuralım mı?<br/>Elçi Pavlus'un bir arkadaşı olan Elçilerin İşleri kitabının yazarı Luka'ya göre de İncil'in yazarı olan Luka, bu iki incelemeyi bir arkadaşı Theophilus'a yazdı. Theophilus Yunanca bir isimdir. Güzel bir anlamı olan bir isimdir. Bu isim, Tanrı'nın sevgilisi anlamına gelir. Onun bir erkek olmadığına inananlar var, ancak İncil ve Elçilerin Kitabı, kim olursanız olun, Tanrı'nın sevgililerine hitaben yazılmıştır. Theophilus'un aslında Luke'un efendisi olduğunu söyleyen başka gelenekler de var. O günlerde doktorlar köleydi, genellikle zengin bir patronun kölesi. Böylece Luke'un efendisi Theophilus oldu ve misyonerlik yolculuklarında Pavlus'un yanında olması için Luke'u serbest bıraktı. Böylece, Luke eski efendisine geri yazıyor. Bu, kilisenin erken bir geleneğidir, ancak tabii ki, birçok gelenek gibi kanıtlamak imkansızdır.<br/>Ayrıca Pavlus Troas'tayken kendisine "Makedonya'ya gel ve bize yardım et" diyen bir adam gördüğüne inananlar da var. Pavlus'un vizyonundaki adam Luka'dan başkası değildi. Pavlus'un Makedonya'ya geldiğinde gerçekten tanıştığı ilk kişi Luke'du. Ve Elçilerin İşleri kitabında olduğu gibi, Elçilerin İşleri kitabının o kısmına geldiğimizde, Luka'nın üçüncü kişiden ziyade birinci şahısta daha fazla yazmaya başladığını göreceksiniz. Bu nedenle, belli ki, Havarilerin İşleri'nin bu noktasında, Luka, Pavlus'un bir arkadaşı oldu ve onunla birlikte yolculuğa başladı. "Onlar" ve "onlar" yerine "biz" zamirlerini kullanmaya başladı. Bu, şüphesiz, Luke'un bu noktadan sonra olan şeylerin bir katılımcısı ve görgü tanığı olduğu yerdir. Bu noktaya geldiğimizde bunu size göstereceğiz.<br/>Elçilerin İşleri'ni Luka'ya Göre İncil'e bağlayarak başlatır. Luka'nın İncil'inde kaydettiği son şeyin Elçilerin İşleri'nde kaydettiği ilk şey olması ilginçtir. Luka İncili'nin kapanışını, İsa'nın havarilerine Kudüs'te yüksekten gelen güçle bitene kadar beklemelerini söylerken görüyoruz. Ve sonra İsa göğe yükseldi ve böylece İncil'i kapattı. Havarilerin İşleri'ni açarken şöyle yazıyor:<br/>İsa'nın hem yapmaya hem de öğretmeye başladığı her şeyi size yazdım mı, ey Theofilos?<br/>Anahtar kelime başladı. Luka'ya Göre İncil, İsa Mesih'in hizmetinin tam hikayesi değildir. Bu sadece İsa Mesih'in bakanlığının başlangıcıdır. İsa insanların ihtiyaçlarına hizmet etmeye devam ediyor. İsa hastaları iyileştirmeye devam ediyor. İsa ölüleri diriltmeye devam ediyor. İsa sevgisine ve müjdesine dünyaya hizmet etmeye devam ediyor, sadece şimdi Kutsal Ruhuyla meshedilmiş olan öğrenciler aracılığıyla hizmet ediyor. Fakat Mesih'in hizmeti devam ediyor; temel olarak, Luka'nın Havarilerin İşleri'nde aldığı öncüldür. İsa'nın hem yapmak hem de öğretmek için başlattığı her şeyin eski incelemesi.<br/>Bundan dolayı Havarilerin İşleri bitmemiş bir kitaptır: Rab bugün kendini Tanrı'nın araçları olmaya adayanların yaşamları boyunca çalışmaya devam etmektedir. Kutsal Ruhu tarafından yönlendirilmek, yönlendirilmek ve meshedilmiş olmak, bugün dünyada İsa'nın hizmetine devam etmek. Şimdi Tanrı, çalışmalarının insan enstrümanları aracılığıyla gerçekleştirilmesini emretti. Bunun başarılması gerektiğini söylemiyorum. Tanrı, meleksi varlıkları O'nun işi için kullanabilir ve Vahiy kitabında, Tanrı'nın tüm dünyadaki insanlara müjdesini duyurmak için melekleri kullanacağı bir zaman gelecek. Vahiy, bölüm 14, "Sonsuz müjdeye sahip cennetin ortasında uçan ilk melek" (Vahiy 14:6). Ama şu anda, Tanrı insan enstrümanlarını kullanmayı seçti. Ne kadar kusurlu olsalar da, yine de Tanrı'nın kullanmayı emrettiği şey budur. Bu konuda heyecan verici olan şey, Tanrı beni kullanacak ve Tanrı seni kullanacak. O kadar çok yalvarıyoruz ki, "Ya Rab, konuşamam. Daha önce hiç konuşamadım, hatta şimdi bile." Musa Tanrı'nın yakarışından uzak durmaya çalıştı. Yeremya, "Tanrım, ben sadece bir çocuğum; kimse beni dinlemeyecek" dedi. Ve hepimizin neden kullanılamadığımız konusunda mazeretleri var. Değil mi? Hepimiz Tanrı'nın bizi kullanamamasının nedenlerini biliyoruz.<br/>Bir keresinde Rab, işini yapması için bir peygamberi çağırırken, "Ya Rab, kimi istersen gönder" dedi. Rab, "Hey, seni çağırdım." "Ya Rab, iyi fikir, kimi istersen gönder" dedi. O kadar sık bu durumdayız ki, "Ya Rab, benden başka dilediğinin eliyle gönder." Ama yine de, Tanrı bizi kullanmayı emretti.<br/>Şimdi, her birimiz kendi kusurlarımızı gösterebiliriz. Her birimiz kendi yetersizliğimizi gösterebiliriz ve hepimiz Tanrı'nın beni kullanmak istememesi için bir bahane bulabiliriz. Ama yine de, Tanrı sizi kullanmayı seçti. Hayatın boyunca kendini muhtaç bir dünyaya ifşa edebilir. Tanrı'nın işi nasıl yaptığını kullanmak için böyle araçlara ne zaman sahip olduğunu merak ediyorsun, değil mi?<br/>Ta ki ele geçirildiği güne kadar, bundan sonra Kutsal Ruh aracılığıyla seçtiği elçilere emirler vermişti (Elçilerin İşleri 1:2).<br/>Bu, Luka İncili'ni onunla sona erdirdi. İsa'nın ele geçirildiği gün, elçilere iktidarın bahşedilmesini beklemelerini söyledikten sonra.<br/>O'na (elçilere) tutkularından sonra (ya da ölümünden sonra) birçok yanılmaz kanıtla (Elçilerin İşleri 1:3) O'na (elçilere) canlı olarak gösterdi.<br/>İsa Mesih'in diriliş gerçeğini inkar etmek zordur. Bu geçen Cumartesi Santa Ana Register'da okuduğum bir makaleden hem rahatsız hem de rahatsız oldum. İl okullarında sunulan yaratılış bilimi ve evrimsel teorilerden. Nasıl, bu profesör bir bilim dersini öğrettiğini ve böylece sadece gerçeklerle uğraştıklarını ve teorilere yerlerinin olmadığını söyledi. Çünkü bilim gerçeğe dayanır ve yaratılış dini batıl inançlara dayanır. Dini teorilere inanmak çok fazla inanç gerektirir. Gerçeklerle uğraşırken, onları sadece kabul edebilirsiniz. "Bilim dersinde çok ilginçti, bana dünyanın dört milyar yaşında olduğunu öğrettiler. Şimdi ise dünyanın on iki milyar yaşında olduğunu öğretiyorlar. Ve o kadar da uzun zaman önce okula gitmedim."<br/>İlginçtir ki, İncil'in hiçbir zaman erkeklerin keşfettiği mevcut verileri karşılamak için gözden geçirilmesine veya güncellenmesine ihtiyaç duyulmamıştır. Yine de, bugün lise fen ders kitaplarımı alıp onlardan bir fen dersi vermeye çalışırsanız, lisedeyken bilimsel gerçek olarak öğretilen birçok şeyin artık bilimsel gerçek olarak tanınmadığını göreceksiniz. Basit hücre protoplazması artık basit bir hücre değil, son derece karmaşıktır. Tarihte kanıtlanabilecek herhangi bir gerçek varsa, İsa Mesih'in ölümden dirilmesi gerçeğidir.<br/>Tanıkların ifadesine dayanan bir hukuk sistemimiz var. Eğer bir adam bir suçla suçlanırsa ve bu suç işlenirken tanıklık eden insanlar varsa ve onlar standarda getirilirlerse ve gerçeği, tüm gerçeği ve sadece gerçeği söyleyeceklerine yemin ederlerse, Tanrı'ya yardım et. Ve sorgularında şunu kabul ediyorlar: "O adamı yirmi üç Mayıs'ta bankada gördüm. Paltosundan silah çektiğini gördüm. Bütün paranın kendisine verilmesini istediğini duydum. Bankadan çıkarken gördüm. Memurun onu dışarıda yakaladığını gördüm." Ve eğer üç ya da dört tanığın o adamı işaret etmesini sağlayabilirseniz ve tanıklıklarını çapraz sorgu altında tutacaksanız, o adam suçlu olarak yargılanır. Bunu yapan odur. O adam hakkında aynı hikâyeye tanıklık eden iki ya da üç tanığımız var ve suç işleyenin kendisi olduğu ve suçlu olduğu kabul ediliyor. Doğrulayan gerçeği söylemeye yemin eden tanıklarınız var.<br/>İsa'nın ölümünden sonra, tekrar dirildiğinde, O'nu gördüklerine dair yemin eden birçok farklı kişiye göründü. O'nunla konuştuklarını, farklı koşullar altında çeşitli yerlerde göründüklerini söyledi. Ve kırk gün boyunca onlarla birlikte ziyaret edildi. Ve bir zamanlar, bir yerde toplanan beş yüz kadar insan, ortaya çıktı. Bu insanların tanıklığını bir kenara atmak ya da inkar etmek zor. Bunu yapmak, tüm hukuk sistemimizi gözden düşürmektir. Ancak bu kişiler, dirilen Rab'bi gördüklerine, O'nunla konuştuklarına, O'nunla yediklerine tanıklık ettiler, hepsi, biri hariç, anlattıkları hikâyenin doğru olduğunu doğruladıkları için diğer insanların ellerinde şiddetli ölümlerle karşılaştılar. Gerçeği, tüm gerçeği, sadece gerçeği söylemeye yemin eden tanıklardan bahsediyorsun, eğer bir kişinin hayatı o tanık yüzünden tehdit edilseydi ve bu bir yalan olsaydı, en azından bir tanesi baskı altında kırılırdı. Bütün aldatmacayı itiraf ederlerdi. "Kendisini tutkularından sonra birçok yanılmaz kanıtla canlı olarak gösterdi."<br/>Kırk gün boyunca onları görmek, Tanrı'nın Egemenliği ile ilgili şeyleri onlara anlatmak (Elçilerin İşleri 1:3):<br/>Bazen Tanrı'nın krallığının zamanlaması ile ilgili sorularından dolayı öğrencileri suçluyoruz. Tanrı'nın krallığının İsa Mesih'in en sevdiği konu olduğunu hatırlayalım. Her zaman Tanrı'nın krallığından bahsederdi ve tüm insanların kalplerine ektiği büyük bir umuttur. İşler her zaman olduğu gibi bozulmaya devam etmeyecek. Dünya sonsuza dek karanlığın gücü altında, kötülüğün esareti altında kalmayacak. Tanrı bir gün krallığını yeryüzünde kuracak. Doğru bir sevinç ve barış krallığı. "İsa saltanat sürecek, Güneş ardışık yolculuklarını yapmadan önce, Krallığı kıyıdan kıyıya yayılacak." Ve o gün dünyanın gördüğü en görkemli gün olacak, O'nun krallığında hastalık, acı ve acı ortadan kalkacak. Günah, açgözlülük ve dünyayı böyle dayanılmaz bir yer yapan bu şeyler O'nun krallığında kaldırılacak. Tanrısız ticaricilik, insanın sömürülmesi, tüm bunlar O hüküm sürdüğünde O'nun şanlı krallığında ortadan kalktı. Şaşılacak bir şey yok, havariler bunu almak için can atıyorlar. Onu almak için sabırsızlanıyorum; Onun krallığının gelmesi için sabırsızlanıyorum. İsa bize dua ettiğimizde, ilk ricamız şudur: "Senin krallığın gelsin. Gökte olduğu gibi yeryüzünde de senin isteğin olsun" (Mat 6:10). Bu hepimizin sahip olması gereken doğru bir arzudur. Tanrı'nın Egemenliğini arzuluyorum. Böylece bu kırk günlük krallık döneminde onlarla konuşuyordu.<br/>Onlarla bir araya gelince, onlara Kudüs'ten ayrılmamalarını, Baba'nın verdiği sözü beklemelerini buyurdu, "Beni duydunuz" dedi (Elçi 1:4).<br/>"Bakın, Baba'nın sözünü alana kadar Kudüs'te bekleyin" dedi. O'nun bahsettiği bu söz, şüphesiz, Yoel'de Rab'bin vaat ettiği sözdür: "Ve sonraki günlerde olacak, Rab diyor ki, Ruh'umu bütün etin üzerine dökeceğim; oğullarınız ve kızlarınız peygamberlik edecek ve gençleriniz rüya görecek, yaşlılarınız görümler görecekler; ve benim kullarım ve hizmetçilerim üzerine Ruh'umu dökeceğim, diyor Rab" (Joe 2:28-29). Baba'nın va'di: Allah'ın, bütün inananların üzerine Ruh'unu dökeceği gün gelecek; her biri Allah'tan bu dinamiği alacak.<br/>Çünkü Yahya gerçekten suyla vaftiz edildi; ama bundan sonra Kutsal Ruhla vaftiz edileceksiniz (Elçilerin İşleri 1:5).<br/>Vaftiz fikri, bapteedzo olan erciondu. Yahya suyla vaftiz edildi, insanları suya batırdı, "birkaç gün içinde Kutsal Ruh'un altında kalmayacaksın".<br/>Bu nedenle bir araya geldiklerinde, ondan, "Ya Rab, şu anda İsrail'e krallığı geri verecek misin?" diye sordular.<br/>"Ne zaman olacak, Tanrım? Bu restorasyonun zamanı ne zaman?" Ve İsa şimdi onlarla konuşuyor, krallık hakkında değil, hizmet için alacakları güç hakkında. Ve böylece sorularını bir kenara atıyor.<br/>Onlara de ki, Baba'nın kendi gücüne koyduğu zamanları ya da mevsimleri bilmek size düşmez (Elçilerin İşleri 1:7).<br/>"Bilmek sana düşmez." Krallığın hemen kurulması beklentisi içinde sürekli yaşadılar. İsa'nın tüm yaşamı boyunca, her an telefon kulübesine girip dünyanın kurtarıcısı olarak çıkmasını bekliyorlardı. Şazzam! Gücünü göstermek ve dünya hükümetlerini devirmek, Tanrı'nın krallığını yeryüzünde kurmak. Ve her gün bu değişimin gerçekleşmesini bekliyorlardı. İsa ne zaman Kudüs'e gitmekten, günahkâr adamın eline teslim edilmekten ve çarmıha gerilmekten söz etse, "Aman Tanrım, hayır, krallığı anlamıyorsun, Tanrım. Senden o kadar uzakta ol." İsa çarmıhta öldüğünde, hepsi büyük hayal kırıklığına uğradı.<br/>Emmaus yolundaki iki öğrenci, çok üzgün. "Hey, arkadaşlar. Yürümeniz kadar nasıl bu kadar üzgünsünüz?" "Ne demek istiyorsunuz? Kudüs'te son zamanlarda olup bitenleri bilmiyorsanız, buralarda bir yabancı olmalısınız." "Ne gibi şeyler?" "Ah, Nasıralı İsa adında bir adam... ah adam, güçlü ve güçlüydü. Tanrı'nın mesh edilmesi O'nun hayatı üzerineydi. Biz O'nun içinde İsrail'in kurtuluşu olduğunu umuyorduk, ama O'nu çarmıha gerdiler. Ummuştuk ki . . . şimdi öldü." Şimdi O dirildi ve diyor ki, "Birkaç gün içinde, dostlar, Baba'nın vaadini alacaksınız." "Ah, ne sözü? Krallığın kurulması vaadi?" Görüyorsunuz, sormaları meşruydu. "Bu Lord mu? Tamam! Şimdi krallığınızı kuracak mısınız? "Hayır. Baba'nın atadığı ya da Baba'nın kendi gücünde olduğu zamanları bilmek size düşmez. Ama Kutsal Ruh üzerinize geldiğinde güç alacaksınız."<br/>Şimdi burada, Yunan prepozisyon episi, Kutsal Ruh ile sahip olacakları yeni bir ilişkiyi belirtmek için kullanılır. İncil'de Yuhanna'ya göre, bölüm 14, İsa'nın Kutsal Ruh'u göndermeye söz verdiği gibi, "Seni rahat bırakmayacağım. Size geleceğim, Baba'ya dua edeceğim ve size dünyanın alamayacağı bir başka avutucu, hatta O'nu görmediği için alamayacağı Gerçek Ruh'u gönderecek, ama siz O'nu biliyorsunuz, çünkü O sizinle birlikte yaşıyor ve O sizin içinizde olacak" (Yuhanna 14:17-18). Bizimkiyle aynı Yunan önkoşulu, sadece "in" yerine "en" yazıyorlar. Yahya'da iki katlı ilişki: O sizinle birlikte, ama O sizin içinizde ikamet edecek. Ama şimdi İsa, Kutsal Ruh üzerinize geldiğinde güç alacağınızı söyledi. Yeni Ahit boyunca farklı metinlerde "üzerinde" veya "üzerinde" olarak çevrilen Yunanca preposition epi, ya da ben "aşırı akışları" seviyorum.<br/>Yuhanna İncili'nin yedinci bölümünde: "Son gün, İsa'nın Tapınak Dağı'nda durup halka şöyle haykırdığı büyük bayram günü, 'Susayan bana gelsin ve içsin; ve verdiğim sudan içen, en içten varlığından, orada yaşayan sular fışkıracak.'" Yahya dedi ki, "Bu Ruh'tan olan, henüz O'na inananların alması gereken bir şey değil" (Yuh 7:37-39). Ruh'tan ne bahsetti? Ben, "Ruh sizden taştığında", üstünüzde veya üstünüzde, ya da sizden taştığında. Yani üç katlı ilişki: O, dönüşümden önce sizinle birliktedir, O, günahkâr olduğunuzu fark etmenizi sağlayan kişidir, O, dünyayı günaha, doğruluğa ve yargıya ikna ederken cevap olarak İsa Mesih'i işaret eden kişidir. Yaşamını ve kalbini İsa Mesih'e açtığın ve O'nu içeri davet ettiğin an Kutsal Ruh gelip seni içine almaya başlar. O senin içinde olacak. "Kendinin olmadığını, bir bedelle satın alındığını bilmiyor musun? O halde Tanrı'yı bedeninde ve ruhunda yücelt. Bedeninin içinde olan Kutsal Ruh'un tapınağı olduğunu bilmiyor musun? Şarapla sarhoş olmayın, ki bu aşırıdır, ama içinizi doldurun, ya da Ruhla dolu olun" (1Co 6:19-20, Eph 5:18). Ama şimdi üçüncü bir ilişki var. Bu güçlendirici bir deneyimdir.<br/>Kutsal Ruh üzerinize geldiğinde (ya da sizden taştığında) dinamiği alacaksınız ve bana tanık olacaksınız (Act 1: 8).<br/>Ve böylece dinamizm, İsa Mesih'in tanığı olmak. Yunanca'da tanık sözcüğünün Martus kelimesi olması ilginçtir. Ve Yunanca'da şehit anlamına gelir. Tanık, sadece inandığını ilan etmekle kalmaz, inandığını yaşar, inandığını yaşar ve o kadar güçlü inanır ki, gerekirse inandığı şey için ölür. Onun inancı ne kadar güçlü. O bir martus. Onu durduramazsın, inandığı şey için ölmekten korkmaz.<br/>Paul'un Kudüs'e dönerken yolda olduğunu ve Agabus'un Caesarea'dan aşağı indiğini ve Paul'un kirişini alıp kendini bağladığını ve "Kudüs'e vardığında bu kirişe sahip olan adam da öyle" dediğini hatırlıyor musun? Ve Paul'un arkadaşları ağlamaya başladı, "Oh, Paul, gitme, gitme" dedi ve dedi ki, "Bu gözyaşlarıyla ne demek istiyorsun? Beni vazgeçireceğini mi sanıyorsun? Bağlanmaktan mı endişeliyim? Ölmeye hazırım." O bir martustu. "Ölmeye hazırım." İnancın uğruna ölüme terk edilmek seni şehit yapmadı; şehit olduğun için ölüme terk edildin. Çünkü sen tanıktın, çünkü çok güçlü olduğuna inandın. Yani, bu sizi tanık yapmadı, sadece ne olduğunuzu kanıtladı. Başından beri tanıktınız. Martus olmasaydın, asla ölmeyecektiniz. Reddedecektiniz; "Vay be, bekle, bekle, bekle" diyecektiniz. Bekle, burada rotamızı değiştirelim. Sanırım bir hata yapmış olabilirim." Sonra diyorsun ki, "Eh, o bir martus değildi. Bir atı çalmak seni at hırsızı yapmaz, sadece öyle olduğunu kanıtlar. At hırsızı olmadığı sürece kimse bir atı çalmaz. Yani, çalmak sizi bir at hırsızı yapmaz, sadece başından beri olduğunuzu kanıtlar. Şehit olmak sadece tanık olduğunuzu kanıtlar, Martus. "Ve siz de tanık olacaksınız." Çoğunun şehit olması ilginç değil mi? "Bana Tanıklar".<br/>Tanık hem Kudüs'te hem de tüm Yahudiye'de olacaktı (Elçilerin İşleri 1:8).<br/>Tanık tam evinde başladı. En zor yer, değil mi? Kudüs'te evinden başlamak için, ve sonra Kudüs çevresinde, Yahudiye bölgesinde. Ve sonra Samiriye'ye yayıldı. Ve sonra dünyanın en uç köşelerine çıkmaktı. Ve Elçilerin İşleri kitabını incelerken, bu ilerlemeyi göreceğiz. Tanık Kudüs'te nasıl başladı. Bunu bir sonraki bölümde alacağız. Sonra da Yahudiye'nin dışına nasıl yayıldığını göreceğiz. Sonra Phillip Samaria'ya gitti ve sonunda Paul ve Barnabas dünyanın en uç köşelerine gitmeye çağrıldılar. Ve böylece tanık, Kutsal Ruh'un meshedilmesi ve güçlenmesi yoluyla yayıldı.<br/>O bunları söylerken, onlar bunu görünce, o alındı; ve bir bulut onu onların gözünden aldı (Elçilerin İşleri 1:9).<br/>Bu, İsa'nın öğrencilerine verdiği son sözdür. Bu, Onun yükselişinden önceki son sözler. Tabii ki, daha sonra Pavlus ve diğerleriyle geldi ve konuştu, ancak Yükselişinden önce, bu onun son sözüdür. Onlar O'nu gözetlerken, O bunları söyleyince, O kalktı ve bir bulut O'nu onların gözünden aldı.<br/>Ve onlar göğe doğru dik dik bakarken, işte, beyaz giysiler içinde yanlarında duran iki adam vardı (Elçilerin İşleri 1:10).<br/>Onların melek olduklarını varsayıyoruz.<br/>Ayrıca şöyle dedi: "Ey Celileli adamlar, neden göğe bakıp duruyorsunuz? Sizden cennete götürülen bu aynı İsa, onun cennete girdiğini gördüğünüz gibi aynı şekilde gelecek (Elçilerin İşleri 1:11).<br/>O'nu göğe yükselmiş olarak gördüler ve O tekrar geldiğinde O'nu görecekler. "İşte Rab, yeryüzünde hüküm vermek için on binlerce aziziyle birlikte geliyor" (Yahud 1:14-15). Sonra, "Bizi seven, bizim için kendini veren ve bizi Tanrımıza, yeryüzünde O'nunla birlikte hüküm sürecek krallara ve rahiplere yapan Tanrı'ya, Rab'bin geldiğini ve her gözün O'nu göreceğini ve O'nu delenlerin de yas tutacağını görün" (Vahiy 1:5-7). Böylece Rab'bin gelişi. Her göz O'nu görecek. Yehova Şahitleri O'nun zaten geldiğini söyler, ama bu bir sırdır. Sadece O'nun gittiğini gören havariler olduğu için, O'nun geri döndüğünü gören Yehova Şahitleri'nin öğrencileriydi. Ama İsa dedi ki, "Size 'O gizlice geldi ve gizli bir odaya girdi' diyorlarsa, buna inanmayın" (Mat 24:26). Bu yüzden İsa'ya veya onlara inanmak için seçim yapmalısınız.<br/>"Sizden cennete götürülen bu aynı İsa, O'nun cennete gittiğini gördüğünüz gibi aynı şekilde gelecek."<br/>Şimdi, II. Yuhanna'da çok ilginç bir ayet var, ayet 1:7, "İsa Mesih'in bedenden geldiğini itiraf etmeyen birçok aldatıcı dünyaya girilir." Bu, ne yazık ki, Yunanca'nın kötü bir çevirisidir. Çünkü bu participle şu andaki zamandadır ve "bedenden geliyor" olarak tercüme edilmelidir. İsa Mesih'in bedenden geldiğini inkar edenler. Yuhanna onlar hakkında ne diyor? "Onlar bir düzenbaz ve Deccal'dir. Kendinize dikkat edin, yaptığımız şeyleri kaybetmeyelim, tam bir ödül alalım. Çünkü kim Mesih'in öğretisine aykırı davranır ve uymazsa, Tanrı'ya sahip değildir. Mesih'in öğretisine uyan, hem Baba'ya hem de Oğul'a sahiptir. Kapınıza (Cumartesi sabahı) gelen ve bu öğretiyi getirmeyen olursa, onu evinize almayın ve ona veda etmeyin. Çünkü ona veda eden, yaptığı kötülüklerin paydaşıdır" (2Jn 1:7-11). Onlara bir soru sorun, "İsa bedenden mi geliyor?" Sadece bu soruyu sorun. Ve eğer hayır derlerse, John'un sizi uyardığını ve John'un size söylediklerini hatırlayın. "Eğer biri İsa Mesih'in bedenden geldiğini itiraf etmezse." Havarilerle birlikteyken "Bana yiyecek bir şeyler ver" dediğini hatırlıyor musun? "Biliyorsun, ruhlar yemez; bana dokun. Gördün mü? Benim." dedi. Bu nedenle, aynı İsa yine O'nun cennete gittiğini gördükleri şekilde geliyor. Ve ben, biri için, bu gelişin çok yakında olduğuna inanıyorum.<br/>Daha sonra Kudüs'ten, Şabat Günü'nün yaklaşık üçte ikisi olan Zeytin Dağı'ndan Kudüs'e geri döndüler. İçeri girdiklerinde, Petrus, Yakup, Yuhanna, Andreas, Filip, Thomas, Bartholomew, Alfaeus oğlu Yakup, Simon Zelotes ve Yakup'un kardeşi Yehuda'nın bulunduğu bir üst odaya çıktılar. Bütün bunlar, dua ve yakarışla, kadınlarla, İsa'nın annesi Meryem'le ve kardeşleriyle bir arada devam etti (Elçilerin İşleri 1:12-14).<br/>Bu, İsa'nın annesi Meryem'in son sözüdür. Bu noktada ve bu noktadan sonra, Havarilerin İşleri'nde veya mektuplarda ondan bahsedilmez. Ölümünden veya ölüm olmadan cennete mucizevi yükselişinden bahsedilmez. Kitap'ta hiçbir şeyden bahsedilmez, sessizdir.<br/>Kardeşleri muhtemelen James'e, Jude'a ve Yusuf ve Meryem'in oğulları olan diğer kardeşlere referans olacaktı.<br/>Üst oda - bunun İsa'nın havarileriyle Son Akşam Yemeği'ni yediği aynı üst oda olduğunu söyleyenler var. Ve yine de, bu üst odayı erken kilisenin buluştuğu tapınak karakollarında bir oda olarak tutanlar var. Seçimini yap.<br/>Ve o günlerde Petrus havarilerin ortasında ayağa kalktı ve dedi ki, (onların isimlerinin sayısı yaklaşık yüz yirmi kişiydi,) insanlar ve kardeşler, bu Kutsal Kitap yerine getirilmiş olmalıydı, bu Kutsal Ruh daha önce Davut'un ağzından İsa'yı alanlara yol gösterici olan Yahuda hakkında konuşmuştu (Elçilerin İşleri 1:15-16).<br/>Yine burada, Peter hala aynı aceleci benliğini. Onlar dua ve dua bekliyorlar, ve Peter ayağa kalktı ve diyor ki, "Sevgililer, yerine getirilmesi gereken bir kutsal kitap var." Ve biliyorsunuz ki devam edecek, "Programı başlatalım; hadi kura atalım ve Judas'ın yerini kimin alacağını öğrenelim." Peter'ın tekrar bedende olduğunu hissediyorum, onun olan o aceleci doğa ortaya çıkıyor. Ve bence Elçilerin İşleri kitabında kilisenin gelecekteki tarihi bunu işaret ediyor. Peter'ın kutsal yazıları anlamasıyla ilgileniyorum, Eski Ahit'teki birçok yerden alıntı yapıyor. Petrus, Eski Ahit yazıtları hakkında çok büyük bir anlayış gösterir ve bu onun lehine bir noktadır.<br/>Petrus'un Davut'un yazdığı şeyleri Kutsal Ruh'a atfettiğine dikkat edin. Böylece, "Bütün kutsal kitaplar Tanrı'nın ilhamıyla verilir" (2Ti 3:16). Kutsal yazıların bir parçası değil. Çünkü, eğer bana yazıtların bir kısmının Tanrı'nın ilhamıyla verildiğini söylerseniz, o zaman size şunu sormam gerekir: "Hangi kısımlar ilhamla, hangi kısımlar ilhamla verilmemiştir?" Ve o zaman bana hangi kısma inanabileceğimi ve hangi kısmına inanamayacağımı söyleyen otorite sensin. Ve Tanrı'nın artık otorite değil, sen otoritesin, başım belada. "Kutsal Yazıların tümüne inanamazsın" diyenlere dikkat edin. Kutsal Yazıların kendileri de, "Kutsal Yazıların tümü Tanrı'nın ilhamıyla verilmiştir" derler. Ve burada, Petrus'un söylediklerini yazan Luka, Davut'un aslında Kutsal Ruh'un sözcüsü olduğunu bildirir. Kutsal Ruh, Davut'un ağzından Yehuda hakkında konuştu.<br/>Çünkü bizimle birlikte sayıldı, [on iki kişiden biriydi] bu hizmetin bir kısmını elde etmişti. Ama şimdi bu adam günahın ödülü olan bir tarla satın aldı; ve başı dik düştü (Elçilerin İşleri 1:17-18).<br/>Tarlayı satın aldı, çömlekçinin tarlasını onbirinci bölüm Zachariah olarak ilan etti.<br/>Baş aşağı düşerek ortalarda parçalandı ve bütün bağırsakları fışkırdı (Elçilerin İşleri 1:18).<br/>Kutsal kitaplarda bir tutarsızlık bulanlar var, çünkü İncillerden birinde Yahuda geri dönüp parayı geri vermeye çalıştığında, "Hey, bu senin sorunun. Onu alamayız." dediler ve onu tapınak hazinesine geri koydular. "Bu kan parası." Sonra onu tapınağın zeminine attı ve dışarı çıkıp kendini astı. Burada Peter bize kafadan düştüğünü ve patladığını söylüyor. Ve bir tutarsızlık hayal edenler var. Çok basit, kendini asmak için ağaca çıktı, ipi boynuna bağladı ve uzuvlarına bağladı ve atladı. Ve düşüşün kuvveti ya ipi ya da kafasını kopardı ve kanyona düştü ve aynen burada söylediği gibi.<br/>Kudüs'te yaşayanların tümü tarafından biliniyordu; tarlaya kendi dillerinde Aceldama, yani kan tarlası denildiği için. Çünkü Mezmurlar kitabında şöyle yazılmıştır: "Yerleşimi ıssız olsun, Kimse oturmasın; ve, Piskoposu bir başkasını alsın" (Elçilerin İşleri 1:19-20).<br/>Şimdi aslında burada iki farklı Mezmurdan alıntı yapıyor. Psa 69:25'ten, Psa 109:8 ile birleştiriyor ve ikisini bir araya getirerek Yahuda ile ilgili bu kehanetleri buluyor.<br/>Bu adamlardan dolayı (Elçilerin İşleri 1:21)<br/>İşte burada, Yehuda'nın yerine havari olacak birini arıyorlar. İşte o zaman aradıkları nitelikler.<br/>Bu nedenle, Rab İsa'nın aramızda ve dışarıda bulunduğu süre boyunca bize eşlik eden bu adamlardan (Elçilerin İşleri 1:21)<br/>Şimdi, İsa'nın havari olmak için on tane seçtiği birçok havari olduğunu hatırlıyorsunuz. Havari kelimesi "gönderilen kişi" anlamına gelir. Ya da havari olmak için on iki tane seçti, bu yüzden onikiyi gönderdi. İnsan hükümetinin sayısı. "Sadece on birimiz var. Yehuda'nın yerini alması için birine ihtiyacımız var, ama en başından beri bizimle birlikte olan birine ihtiyacımız var."<br/>Yahya tarafından vaftiz edildiği günden, bizden alındığı güne kadar, O'nun dirilişine tanık olmak için bir kişi görevlendirilmelidir (Elçilerin İşleri 1:22).<br/>Bu yüzden aradıkları gereklilikler bunlardı. Bunca zamandır etrafta olan biri. Yahya'nın vaftizinden yükselişe kadar. Ve dirilen Rab'bi gören ve böylece dirilişin gerçekliğini, gerçeğe tanıklıklarını taşıyabilen biri.<br/>Elçi Pavlus, daha sonra bir havari olduğunu ileri sürerek, "Yükselen Mesih'i görmedim mi?" dedi. Açıkça görülüyor ki, bu havariliğin gerekliliklerinden biriydi. Birisi bana, "Bugün havariler var mı?" diye sordu. Yeni Ahit'te oldukları gibi aynı anlamda olduğunu sanmıyorum. Şüphesiz bugün dirilişe tanıklık edebilecek hiç kimse yoktur.<br/>İki kişiyi atadılar: Yusuf, Justus ve Matthias olarak adlandırılan Barsabas'ı çağırdı. Dua ettiler ve dediler ki, "Ey bütün insanların yüreğini bilen Rab, seçtiğin bu iki kişiden biri olup olmadığını göster" (Elçi 1:23-24).<br/>Tanrı'ya iki seçenek sunmakla hata ettiğimizi düşünüyorum, her ikisi de yanlış. Tanrı'yı sınırlamak, görüyorsunuz. Bunu yapmaya çok eğilimliyiz. Açıkçası, Paul Tanrı'nın tercihiydi. Peter aceleciydi ve silahtan atlayarak, "Hey, bir şeyler yapmalıyız, Tanrı'ya yardım etmeliyiz. Bilirsin, biri kayıp ve onu doldurmamız gerekiyor." Ve yine, "Tanrım, bu ikisinden hangisini istiyorsun?" Ve Tanrı'ya iki seçenek sunuyor.<br/>Bu hizmetten ve Yahuda'nın haddi aşarak düştüğü bu elçilikten, kendi yerine gitmesi için pay alsın diye. Ve böylece kuralarını verdiler (Elçilerin İşleri 1:25-26).<br/>Tanrı'nın iradesini belirlemeye çalıştıkları ilginç bir yol. Zar atalım, Tanrı'nın iradesinin burada ne olduğunu bulalım. İnsanların Tanrı'nın iradesini ayırt etmek için tasarladıkları çeşitli yollar bana ilginç geliyor. Şimdi, Eski Ahit zamanlarında, Urim ve Thummim aracılığıyla Rab'be danışacak olan rahip için ilginç bir yol vardı, "ışıklar ve mükemmellikler." Tam olarak bu Urim ve Thummim'in ne olduğunu bilmiyoruz. Joseph Smith'in Altın Tabletlerle bulduğu renkli gözlükler olmadığına eminim; sihirli gözlükler, taktığınızda aniden hiyeroglif yazısını okuyabiliyorsunuz.<br/>Urim ve Thummim'in aslında papazın göğsündeki bir keseye takılan siyah ve beyaz bir taş olduğunu söyleyenler var. Dua edip Rab'be belirli bir soru sorarlardı. Davut'un Rab'be kesin sorular sorduğunu hatırlıyor musun: "Rab, Filistliler'e karşı mı çıkacağız?" Cevap, "Hayır"dı. Ertesi gün yine, "Rab, Filistliler'e karşı mı çıkacağız?" Cevap, "Evet." "Ne zaman gideceğiz?" Belirli sorular sorarlardı ve Rab onları Urim ve Thummin aracılığıyla yönlendirirdi. Rahibin dua edeceğini, Tanrı'yı arayacağını ve daha sonra iki taştan birine uzanıp çıkaracağını söylerler. Beyaz taş olsaydı, evet bir cevaptı. Eğer bir hayır olsaydı, o zaman çıkaracağı siyah taş olurdu. Hatta bazıları bu Urim ve Thummim'den karatoplu terimi aldığımızı söylüyor. Aslında, orijinalinde, belirli bir projeye veya fikre karşı bir oy yok. Urim ve Thummim'in ne olduğunu bilmiyoruz. Ama Eski Ahit döneminde, Tanrı'nın iradesini belirlemek için kur yapmak için bir yöntem kullandılar.<br/>Bu yüzden burada öğrenciler, Tanrı'nın Yahuda İskaryot'un yerine seçtiği iki adamdan hangisini seçtiğini görmek için zar atarken aynı şeyi algılıyorlar.<br/>Matthias'ın üzerine çok düştü; on bir (Elçilerin İşleri 1:26) ile numaralandırıldı.<br/>Şimdi dünyada Matthias kim? Onu daha önce ya da daha sonra kimse duymadı. Matthias'la tanışmak ve kim olduğunu ve ne yaptığını öğrenmek ilginç olacak. Sonraki tarihten itibaren, Tanrı'nın Pavlus'u bir havari olarak seçtiğini varsaymak açık. Pavlus bunu kendisi ilan eder. Şimdi bu, Tanrı'nın iradesini kura çekerek ya da şans eseri bir şey yaparak ayırt etmek isteyen onları son kez okuyoruz.<br/>Bugün Rab'bin iradesini ayırt etmek isteyen bir adam tanıyorum, dua edecek ve Rab'be bir soru soracak. Cebinde on peni olacak ve dua ederken, gözleri kapalı peniyi alıp masanın üzerine koyacak ve eğer hepsi kafaları yukarı gelirse, bu bir evet. İlginç bir şey, arada bir, hepsi kafa kafaya gelecek ve bu oldukça iyi bir olasılık. Yine de, Kutsal Ruh verildikten sonra bunun için herhangi bir kalıp bulamıyoruz. Kutsal Ruh kiliseye vardığında, Kutsal Ruh onlarla konuşmaya ve onları yönlendirmeye başladı. Kutsal Ruh, "Onları çağırdığım bakanlık için bana Pavlus ve Barnabas'ı ayırın" dedi (Elçi 13:2). Ve Kutsal Ruh onları gönderdi. Böylece kiliseyi Kutsal Ruh tarafından daha doğrudan yönlendirilmiş buluyoruz. Kutsal Ruh geldikten sonra, Tanrı'nın iradesini bulmak için bu zar atma bir kenara bırakıldı.<br/>"<br/><br/>Kral James Sürümü<br/><br/>Bu, Kutsal Kitap'ın 1769 Kral James Sürümü (Yetkili Sürüm olarak da bilinir).

Yes that is correct, the Urbanears don't have a built in noise cancelling mic on the headphone itself but from what I can see there is a mic on the cable provided.<br/>1. Well the mic is usually placed where it can have a connection to the PCB which are within the headphones so if you mean that the mic shouldn't be on the headphone itself, that (from my experience) is incorrect.<br/>2.

In fact, dynamic drivers work exactly the same as dynamic microphones but in reverse. Inside a dynamic driver there is a magnet, and when you plug in the headphones, you are sending a AC current through it which will turn the voice coil into a magnet. Depending on the direction of the current, the polarity of the magnet will change. Now since we know for a magnet, same charges repels and different charges attract, we know that the voice coil will move back and forth depending on it's polarity at the time. The voice coil is attached to the diaphragm which will then move back and forth creating a sound wave. The same occurs in reverse, if you move a coil through a magnet you produce a current instead. Since your voice is pushing the diaphragm, it is moving the voice coil back and forth generating the current you have observed.<br/><br/>100+ Head-Fier<br/><br/>Joined:<br/>Nov 7, 2011<br/><br/>Posts:<br/>134<br/><br/>Likes: 55<br/><br/>Exactly.

Stalin's opposition within the party, including Bukharin, Yagoda and Rykov were purged in these show trials, as Stalin manipulatively forced them to confess to crimes of planning a coup and opposing the state, even if there was no proof. Gabor T Rittersporn said, "Many of the victims were sincerely devoted to the principles of Bolshevism." This amplifies proof that the Bolshevik ideals that had once been the roots of the Communist Party were being disarranged and destroyed by the Purges. The party was depleted and former members helplessly watched Stalin use the great purge as a tool to transform Russia from a one party state to an unchallenged dictatorship. Again, the purges were shattering the framework of the Communist Party, formed during the Bolshevik revolution. This agrees with the "Stalin the executioner" source as both show the manipulative character, that helped the dictator to enhance his grip on Russia's throat.<br/>The manipulative manner, with which Stalin incriminated his targeted opposition during the purges, in the eyes of everyday Russians, also had an implosive impact on Soviet Society. Stalin was able to collect support from the people through his use of propaganda and the media to help him develop a "cult of personality" and the image of a heroic and brave leader. Through this support Stalin implanted mistrust into the minds of the people, convincing them that traitors of the revolution and what he described as 'enemies of the people', were amongst them.

| Supercell is nerfing brawlers instead of nerfing star powers. I was at 750 last season with power 8 nita and it is very tough to go past that, like, star powers play a really dominant role. The matchmaking is also trash. When i play gem grab(around 600 trophies), there are often matchups where the enemy team has one more player than us who is maxed and it's not even that we have a lvl 9 to compete versus that. Sometimes there are even matchups where the enemy team is fully maxed and none of us are. this is why i dont play brawl stars seriously anymore. It's not even like there arent many players who are not maxed and around 600 trophies. It's annoying.<br/>Edit: I think supercell should have at least a basic mechanism that takes the average of levels of brawlers when setting up matches.<br/><br/>Except trophies don't really indicate your skill. They indicate the skill of the teammates you are placed with. And I'm fine with playing against higher level brawlers, but when one team is all level 10 and the other team isn't, clearly it's unbalanced.<br/><br/>I reccomend getting some good friends to play with, me and 2 friends got my friends power 1 tick to rank 28 by playing gem grab with a certain composition all day and we made it without a single one of us being maxed with our brawlers.<br/><br/>I Know how you feel I used to have brawlers in high trophies with low level and it's to difficult to go more further and everything I was saying to myself "I want to have star powers" really supercell needs to make balance to the star powers or at least make a better matchmaking system.<br/><br/>I kinda feel this. I ain't as good at the game as you, but I got Emz to 500 at power 1 and the matchmaking was horrible. Maxed out players everywhere! And it didn't help that the majority of my teammates had around 5-8k trophies... I had to resort to solo showdown last minute because I can either ambush unsuspecting players or simply play a little aggressive at the right times. But I really wish that it could be a bit easier for people who want to push brawlers to really high trophy ranges without having the luxury of star powers.<br/><br/>Altho spike is still good without curveball. Curveball was just a help for hitting your shots more often as spike. But even before curveball was released, spike was a really strong brawler, so he will remain the same now.<br/><br/>I agree that they should have nerfed ambush, but I think they are trying to balance both Snappy Sniping and Ambush, as they are both getting merged with this change. She was becoming a little powerful, but still not nerf-worthy<br/><br/>I'm not sure about this, but now that Darryl got a noticeable buff, looking at their new stats, it looks like Darryl might overshadow Bull, as not only he can always deal more damage than Bull, he won't die as early anymore, so their survivability will be similar without star power (although Bull's survivability is still noticeably better than Darryl's if he had Tough Guy). Not only that, Darryl's super can auto regenerate, meaning Darryl MIGHT be able to be played effectively both as a heavyweight AND an assassin at the same time (before he sucks as a heavyweight but decent as an assassin)<br/><br/>But hes overrated af. And you get trophies with him really easily. So im kinda ok with the nerf. I havent even played him since when I got him to 500 (around 5 months ago), so not that I care that much either.<br/><br/>Why doesn't Poco/Penny get a HP nerf, if they are Marksman/Healer respectively not a tank?<br/>Why isn't Rosa's tankyness nerfed, cough 70% damage reduction?<br/>Why is Tick allowed to have the highest range and the most free pokedamage in the entire game?<br/>Why doesn't Leon get a HP/Damage buff?<br/><br/>Be that as it may, it was Ambush that was OP, not base Piper. I would argue that Ambush is the best star power in the game (now even more so since the percentage of damage increase indirectly went up) and base Piper was a bottom-10 brawler.<br/><br/>What Supercell should do is revert both nerfs, reduce Ambush to 600, and reduce Snappy Sniping to 0.25 since it'd be indirectly buffed by the base damage buff.<br/><br/>Yea and I believe they went a bit too far with Rosa, because now she is basically the better bull now when it comes to tanking, which she has been for a while. Now, Darryl might as well be a smaller, more powerful bull<br/><br/>Why? I feel she needs a buff in almost everything except her star power. Her health and speed make her super a bit more difficult to use, because she can die pretty easily, and it is really difficult for her to trap faster brawlers like Crow. Her star power is a bit broken though... | Supercell, nerfing yıldız güçleri yerine nerfing kavgacıları. Geçen sezon 750'de güç 8 nita ileydim ve yıldız güçlerinin gerçekten baskın bir rol oynadığını geçmek çok zor. Çöpçatanlık da çöp. Mücevher kapmaca oynadığımda (yaklaşık 600 kupa), düşman takımının bizden daha fazla oyuncuya sahip olduğu ve buna karşı rekabet etmek için bir lvl 9'a sahip olmadığı sık sık eşleşmeler vardır. Bazen düşman takımının tamamen maksimize edildiği ve hiçbirimizin olmadığı maçlar bile olur. Bu yüzden artık kavga yıldızlarını ciddi olarak oynamıyorum. Maksimum ve 600 civarında kupa olmayan birçok oyuncu bile yok. Sinir bozucu.<br/>Edit: Bence supercell, maçları kurarken kavgacıların ortalamasını alan en azından temel bir mekanizmaya sahip olmalıdır.<br/><br/>Ancak kupalar gerçekten sizin becerinizi göstermez. Takım arkadaşlarınızın yeteneklerini gösterirler. Ve üst düzey dövüşçülere karşı oynamakta iyiyimdir, ancak bir takım 10. seviye ve diğer takım olmadığı zaman, açıkça dengesizdir.<br/><br/>Oynamak için bazı iyi arkadaşlar almayı tavsiye ediyorum, ben ve 2 arkadaşım arkadaşlarımın gücü 1 kene, tüm gün belirli bir kompozisyonla mücevher kapma oynayarak 28 sırada yer aldı ve tek birimizin kavgacılarımızla maksimize edilmeden başardık.<br/><br/>Nasıl hissettiğini biliyorum, düşük seviyeli yüksek kupalarda kavgacılara sahiptim ve daha ileri gitmek zor ve kendime söylediğim her şey "Yıldız güçlerine sahip olmak istiyorum" gerçekten süperhücrenin yıldız güçlerine denge sağlaması veya en azından daha iyi bir çöpçatanlık sistemi yapması gerekiyor.<br/><br/>Bunu hissediyorum. Ben senin kadar iyi değilim, ama Emz'i güç 1'de 500'e aldım ve çöpçatanlık korkunçtu. Her yerde oyuncuları maksimize etti! Ve takım arkadaşlarımın çoğunun yaklaşık 5-8k kupası olması yardımcı olmadı... Son dakikada solo gösteriye başvurmak zorunda kaldım çünkü ya şüpheli olmayan oyuncuları pusuya düşürebilirim ya da doğru zamanlarda biraz agresif oynayabilirim. Ama gerçekten, yıldız güçlerinin lüksüne sahip olmadan kavgacıları gerçekten yüksek kupa aralıklarına itmek isteyen insanlar için biraz daha kolay olmasını diliyorum.<br/><br/>Altho spike, viraj topu olmadan hala iyidir. Eğri top, atışlarınızı sivri uç olarak daha sık vurmak için sadece bir yardımdı. Ancak eğri top serbest bırakılmadan önce bile, sivri uç gerçekten güçlü bir kavgacıydı, bu yüzden şimdi aynı kalacak.<br/><br/>Nerf pusu kurmaları gerektiğini kabul ediyorum, ama bence ikisi de bu değişiklikle birleştikleri için hem Snappy Sniping hem de Ambush'u dengelemeye çalışıyorlar. Biraz güçleniyordu, ama yine de nerf değeri yoktu.<br/><br/>Bundan emin değilim, ama şimdi Darryl yeni istatistiklerine bakarak fark edilebilir bir buff'a sahip olduğu için, Darryl Bull'u gölgede bırakabilir gibi görünüyor, sadece Bull'dan daha fazla zarar vermekle kalmayıp, artık erken ölmeyecek, bu yüzden hayatta kalmaları yıldız gücü olmadan da benzer olacaktır (Bull'un hayatta kalabilmesi hala Darryl'den daha iyi olsa da eğer Zor Guy'a sahipse). Sadece bu değil, Darryl'in süperi otomatik olarak yenilenebilir, yani Darryl MIGHT hem ağır siklet hem de aynı anda bir suikastçı olarak etkili bir şekilde oynanabilir (ağır siklet olarak emilmeden önce ama bir suikastçı olarak iyi).<br/><br/>Ama o af abarttı. Ve onunla kupalar gerçekten kolay olsun. Yani nerf ile biraz tamam. Onu 500'e aldığımdan beri bile oynamadım (yaklaşık 5 ay önce), bu yüzden o kadar da umurumda değil.<br/><br/>Neden Poco/Penny HP nerf almıyor, eğer Marksman/Healer sırasıyla bir tank değilse?<br/>Neden Rosa'nın tankı nerfed değil, öksürük %70 hasar azaltma?<br/>Neden Tick'in tüm oyundaki en yüksek menzile ve en ücretsiz pokedamage'a sahip olmasına izin verilir?<br/>Leon'a neden HP/Damage buff verilmiyor?<br/><br/>Olabileceği gibi, o OP idi Ambush oldu, Piper tabanı değil. Ben Ambush oyundaki en iyi yıldız gücü olduğunu iddia ediyorum (daha da fazla hasar artışı yüzdesi dolaylı olarak yükseldiğinden beri) ve baz Piper bir alt-10 brawler oldu.<br/><br/>Supercell'in yapması gereken, her iki nerf'i de geri döndürmek, Ambush'u 600'e düşürmek ve Snappy Sniping'i 0.25'e düşürmektir, çünkü dolaylı olarak temel hasar buff'ı tarafından buffedilecekti.<br/><br/>Evet ve ben Rosa ile biraz fazla ileri gittiklerine inanıyorum, çünkü şimdi tanking söz konusu olduğunda daha iyi bir boğa, ki bu bir süredir var. Şimdi, Darryl daha küçük, daha güçlü bir boğa olabilir.<br/><br/>Neden? Yıldız gücü dışında hemen hemen her şeyde bir buff'a ihtiyacı olduğunu hissediyorum. Sağlığı ve hızı onu süper kullanımı biraz daha zor hale getiriyor, çünkü oldukça kolay ölebiliyor ve Crow gibi daha hızlı dövüşçüleri tuzağa düşürmek onun için gerçekten zor. Yıldız gücü biraz bozuk olsa da... |

| Self-Employment Part 1<br/><br/>When you accept an employment in any organisation, you have to perform various jobs as per the requirements of your employer and you may get a fixed amount of income as salary. You may run a small retail shop, tailoring shop, restaurant, bakery and confectionery, beauty salon, etc. in your locality. You may get engaged in trading or manufacturing on a small scale or providing some service for a price. Such economic activities are known as self-employment.<br/><br/>Meaning of Self-Employment<br/><br/>Earning is necessary for a living. Our father, mother, brothers, sisters and others may be engaged in different economic activities through which they earn their livelihood. These persons are engaged in an economic activity which is termed as wage employment or paid employment. But there are many persons who engage themselves in an occupation or some business which they start and manage on their own. They put in their best effort and take all types of risks to pursue their careers successfully. The entire earning of their work goes to them. All of us have seen small grocery shops, tailoring shops, medical stores etc. in our locality. These are owned and managed by a person, with or without the help of some assistants. Their economic activities are termed as self-employment.

Thus, self-employment may provide employment to other persons as well.<br/><br/>The earning from self-employment is not fixed. It depends on the income one can earn by producing or buying and selling goods or providing services to others at a price.<br/><br/>In self-employment, the owner alone has to take the profit and bear the risk of loss. So, we find a direct link between the effort and reward in self-employment.<br/><br/>It requires some amount of capital investment, although it may be small.<br/><br/>In self-employment, a person is free to take decisions in respect of running his business profitably and avail of any opportunity that may come up for expansion of his business. It gives complete freedom to work as per one's own will and within the parameters of the prevailing laws.<br/><br/>Thus, self-employment may be defined as, an economic activity which one may perform on his own as a gainful occupation, and this may consist of producing and selling goods, buying and selling goods, or rendering services for a price. | Öz İstihdam Bölüm 1<br/><br/>Herhangi bir kuruluşta bir istihdamı kabul ettiğinizde, işvereninizin gereksinimlerine göre çeşitli işler yapmanız gerekir ve maaş olarak sabit bir gelir elde edebilirsiniz.

| How to use tags in WordPress posts<br/><br/>If you are using WordPress you will notice the option to create tags for your post. But what are tags, and how are they different from categories?<br/><br/>The confusion over what tags do, and how to use them well, leads to a host of problems that can affect your search engine optimization. For example, you may be using too many tags for a short post, or using tags only once. This leads to issues like duplicate content and really, really ineffective website organization. Here are some things you need to know about using WordPress tags.<br/><br/>How tags work<br/><br/>When you post anything on WordPress, that article is shown on the front page of your website, the category page, and the tag page. Essentially this helps people find your article.<br/><br/>Let's say you write an article on anti-aging moisturizers for a woman's website. It will land on the 'Recent articles' page plus its general category (beauty). But let's say you tag it under 'skincare.' So if you wrote another article with the same tag (say, eyecreams) then your reader can find these related articles. That's a good thing.<br/><br/>But it wouldn't make sense to create a new tag just on anti-aging moisturizers, if you're never going to write an article like that again. And if you assign, say, 20 tags on that post, that means your article will be posted 20 times on your blog. That's way too much duplicate content, and can ultimately be confusing or useless to your readers.<br/><br/>To see how how many words fall under each post, click the 'word cloud' or 'tag cloud' on your blog.<br/><br/>How to create a system for tags<br/><br/>Think of tags as a way of filing posts. List down the keywords you want to push in your website, and be consistent in terms of how you will spell them. If you are having a hard time thinking of keywords, imagine how a 'tag page' would look and the kind of articles that would have fallen under them. Foresee how many posts would possibly use that tag. Discard those that are too narrow, and narrow down that are too general to assist in an article search.<br/><br/>The tags should be different from the category names, since there are category pages anyway. Use tags to create an additional way of organizing your posts. | WordPress gönderilerinde etiketler nasıl kullanılır<br/><br/>WordPress kullanıyorsanız, gönderiniz için etiket oluşturma seçeneğini fark edeceksiniz. Ancak etiketler nedir ve kategorilerden nasıl farklıdırlar?<br/><br/>Etiketlerin ne yaptığı ve nasıl iyi kullanılacağı konusundaki karışıklık, arama motoru optimizasyonunuzu etkileyebilecek bir dizi soruna yol açar. Örneğin, kısa bir gönderi için çok fazla etiket kullanıyor olabilirsiniz veya yalnızca bir kez etiket kullanıyor olabilirsiniz. Bu, yinelenen içerik ve gerçekten, gerçekten etkisiz web sitesi organizasyonu gibi sorunlara yol açar. İşte WordPress etiketlerini kullanma hakkında bilmeniz gereken bazı şeyler.<br/><br/>Etiketler nasıl çalışır<br/><br/>WordPress'te herhangi bir şey gönderdiğinizde, bu makale web sitenizin, kategori sayfasının ve etiket sayfasının ön sayfasında gösterilir. Esasen bu, insanların makalenizi bulmasına yardımcı olur.<br/><br/>Diyelim ki bir kadının web sitesi için yaşlanma karşıtı nemlendiriciler hakkında bir makale yazdınız. 'Son makaleler' sayfasına artı genel kategorisine (güzellik) inecek. Ama diyelim ki 'cilt bakımı' altında etiketlediniz. Yani aynı etiketle (örneğin, göz kremleri) başka bir makale yazdıysanız, okuyucunuz bu ilgili makaleleri bulabilir. Bu iyi bir şey.<br/><br/>Ancak bir daha böyle bir makale yazmayacaksanız, yaşlanma karşıtı nemlendiriciler üzerinde yeni bir etiket oluşturmak mantıklı olmaz. Ve bu gönderiye 20 etiket atarsanız, makaleniz blogunuzda 20 kez yayınlanacağı anlamına gelir. Bu çok fazla çoğaltılmış içeriktir ve sonuçta okuyucularınız için kafa karıştırıcı veya işe yaramaz olabilir.<br/><br/>Her bir gönderinin altına kaç kelime düştüğünü görmek için, blogunuzdaki 'kelime bulutu' veya 'etiket bulutu'nu tıklayın.<br/><br/>Etiketler için bir sistem nasıl oluşturulur<br/><br/>Etiketleri gönderileri dosyalamanın bir yolu olarak düşünün. Web sitenizde itmek istediğiniz anahtar kelimeleri listeleyin ve bunları nasıl yazacağınız konusunda tutarlı olun. Anahtar kelimeleri düşünmekte zorlanıyorsanız, bir 'etiket sayfası'nın nasıl görüneceğini ve bunların altına düşecek makalelerin türünü hayal edin. Bu etiketi kaç gönderinin kullanacağını görün. Çok dar olanları atın ve bir makale aramasında yardımcı olamayacak kadar genel olanları daraltın.<br/><br/>Etiketler kategori adlarından farklı olmalıdır, çünkü yine de kategori sayfaları vardır. Gönderilerinizi düzenlemenin ek bir yolunu oluşturmak için etiketleri kullanın. |
| Field Sobriety Tests in New York<br/><br/>Field Sobriety Tests in New York<br/><br/>New York State takes driving under the influence of alcohol very seriously. Despite the fact that it is well known that drunk driving is very dangerous for the driver and others on the road, these acts still occur regularly. When a law enforcement officer pulls someone over on suspicion of driving while intoxicated, they will typically administer a series of field sobriety tests that are used to determine the individual's potential for intoxication.<br/><br/>There are three types of field sobriety tests. The horizontal gaze nystagmus test, the walk and turn test, and the one leg stand test. These tests are designed to be difficult for an intoxicated person to pass but for some, it is actually impossible based on circumstances that are unrelated to alcohol or intoxication. For example, if an individual is wearing high heels during the walk and turn test but the law enforcement officer fails to let them know that they are able to remove the heels for the test, it may be considered invalid.<br/><br/>There are many different defenses to field sobriety tests and to driving while intoxicated as a whole. If you have been charged with a DUI | New York'ta Field Sobriety Testleri<br/><br/>New York'ta Field Sobriety Testleri<br/><br/>New York Eyaleti alkol etkisi altında sürüşü çok ciddiye alır. Sarhoş sürüşün sürücü ve yoldaki diğerleri için çok tehlikeli olduğu iyi bilinmesine rağmen, bu eylemler hala düzenli olarak gerçekleşir. Bir kolluk görevlisi sarhoşken sürüş şüphesiyle birini çektiğinde, tipik olarak bireyin zehirlenme potansiyelini belirlemek için kullanılan bir dizi saha ayıklığı testi uygulayacaktır.<br/><br/>Üç tip saha ayıklığı testi vardır. Yatay bakışlı nystagmus testi, yürüyüş ve dönüş testi ve tek ayaklı stand testi. Bu testler sarhoş bir kişinin geçmesi zor olacak şekilde tasarlanmıştır, ancak bazıları için alkol veya sarhoşlukla ilgisi olmayan durumlara dayanarak aslında imkansızdır. Örneğin, bir kişi yürüyüş ve dönüş testi sırasında yüksek topuklu ayakkabı giyiyorsa ancak kolluk görevlisi test için topuklu ayakkabıyı çıkarabileceklerini bildirmekte başarısız olursa, geçersiz kabul edilebilir.<br/><br/>Bir bütün olarak sarhoşken saha ayıklığı testlerine ve sürüşe birçok farklı savunma vardır. Bir DUI ile suçlandıysanız |
