| While acknowledging that it's impossible to argue someone into loving something they hate, and vice versa, it's still often enjoyable to attempt the argument. When we talk to people whose opinions directly contradict ours, we're forced to defend our tastes, define our opinions, and analyze why we react the way we do. Which is why we have Why Don't You Like This?, in which two of our staffers will attempt to discover whether people with opposing opinions can get beyond "No, you're wrong!" and have a civil, constructive, and possibly even convincing discussion about their points of contention. Because no matter what talk radio says, there's still a middle ground between "We agree utterly" and "I'm right, and you're stupid and evil."<br/><br/>Scott: Since discussing my Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World apostasy, we've been looking for a case where I can call you out for not liking something wonderful, and we didn't have to look for long. We were sitting right next to each other during Martin Scorsese's Hugo—me, utterly enchanted by its fantastical tribute to the wonders of early silent cinema, and you, apparently resisting it at every turn. Critical consensus has been on my side: It hit the No. 9 spot on our collective Top 15 (though you listed it as your Overrated choice), has won (or placed) in various film-critic awards, and currently enjoys an 83 score on Metacritic. That doesn't mean you're wrong, of course, but the onus is on you to explain why Hugo was, in your words, "hollow and artificial," where many of us saw it as a lovely evocation of Scorsese's childhood and the medium when it was still in its infancy. And please be gentle as you rip this butterfly apart by the wings.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Tasha: I can't be gentle, Scott. Sometimes it hurts less if you rip the Band-Aid off all at once. (And even if it doesn't, who wants to walk around wearing a half-ripped-off Band-Aid? Gross.) The fact is, I found Hugo to be a wearyingly manipulative exercise in fakery, starting from its opening glide through a Paris train station, which reminded me more than anything of Robert Zemeckis' The Polar Express. Unlike Mike D'Angelo, I'm a fan of long, unbroken takes as a way of establishing a space and encouraging viewers to unconsciously hold their breaths as a camera explores an area; but when the space being explored is a slick, shiny CGI creation, and the camera floats weightlessly through it with no physical sense that either the camera or the surroundings are really there, that exploration starts to feel like watching someone else play a videogame. And the rest of the film felt similarly poreless and unreal to me, both in terms of its setting and in terms of its highly contrived, maudlin story.<br/><br/>I don't necessarily have a problem with manufactured, stylized environments in film. I loved Baz Luhrmann's equally sprawling, utterly artificial take on Paris in Moulin Rouge, for instance, but that film has a sense of its own ridiculousness, a sense of humor about how deliberately over-the-top it is. Ditto the stylization of Jean-Pierre Jeunet, particularly in Amélie. (Both Jeunet and Luhrmann felt like strong visual influences here.) I got the sense, however, that Martin Scorsese wanted me to take Hugo entirely seriously. Even though it's yet another achingly sentimental story about a plucky orphan bringing color back into the life of a grumpy old curmudgeon. And I just couldn't.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>There is nothing I enjoy more in film than being surprised. And there's nothing I resent and resist more than being overtly manipulated, being loudly told what to feel and when to feel it. A good film does this kind of thing subtly; a bad one uses crashing music cues and sweet strings—and in this case, a grubby, huge-eyed, disheveled orphan staring woefully at the camera—to demand pathos, and to tell viewers they're horrible people if they don't serve it up on demand. That said, I can deal with sad kids and grumpy adults making life better for each other—I really dug this year's Le Havre, which was essentially the same plot without all the cutesiness—but I find the artificial environments reflect badly on the artificial emotions, and each makes the other seem more fake by turns.<br/><br/>Let's start with that. In our overlooked films video, you and Noel both took Keith to task for championing Tyrannosaur, because you felt it wasn't realistic enough—too contrived, too miserablist, too much, too far. How is it possible that you can't buy a stymied old crank who breaks things when he's angry, but you can buy an orphan living inside a giant train-station clock and embarking upon a whimsical journey to repair a mysterious automaton that he believes might bear secrets from his dead father, but which instead leads him on a quirky voyage of self-discovery, into the magical land of cinema? Did you never find Hugo's gaudy rococo design, aggressive heartstring-plucking, or wheelbarrow-loads of quirk even a little excessive or hard to swallow?<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Scott: Jeunet and Luhrmann as influences on Scorsese?! Forget being indelicate, now you're deliberately poking me with a sharp stick. If you're looking for inspirations for Hugo—indeed, if you're looking for the emotional core of Hugo—you have to go back to Scorsese's childhood on Elizabeth Street in Little Italy, where an asthmatic little boy, unable to play outside with the other kids, retreated to Alexander Korda fantasies like The Thief Of Bagdad. Or, more simply, just go straight to the source himself: George Méliès, whose A Trip To The Moon remains the Big Bang of all cinematic fantasies, that moment when the camera was not used to document the world as it is, but whatever whimsical, magical, transporting place a filmmaker wants to invent for it. And that tradition has been developed and expanded upon for decades before the likes of Jeunet and Luhrmann got their grubby little paws on it.<br/><br/>And speaking of Jeunet, nice attempt to take away my rhetorical weapon, but I'll say it anyway: How can you love Amélie, yet find Hugo synthetic and "excessive" and "wearyingly manipulative"? You say that Amélie and Moulin Rouge have redeeming "sense of [their] own ridiculousness" where Scorsese means us to take Hugo seriously, and I don't think that's the case, at least on the latter point. That Scorsese feels evident passion about the movies is, I suppose, why you'd interpret Hugo as self-serious. But to me, it's those feelings that give the film an emotional ballast that the Luhrmann and Jeunet films don't have. All three films make aggressive use of the marvels of CGI—and Scorsese adds 3D to the mix, to wonderful effect—but where you and I differ is on the issue of weightlessness. I agree that CGI has a distancing effect; worlds composed entirely of digital plasticine are flexible to the point where they sometimes have no presence. You referred to Hugo in your "Overrated" entry for our Best Of Film piece as "a CGI gimcrack"—a perfect dis… for another movie.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>It's fair to say that Scorsese has built Hugo around a standard-issue, "heartstring-plucking" children's book/movie plot: Orphan misses his daddy, creates his own little fantasy world, gloms onto a new friend, convinces a crusty old fuddy-duddy to soften up and maybe adopt him. But that's just the narrative skeleton, and Scorsese provides plenty of flesh and blood. For one, you can't watch Hugo, the lonely boy, peering out from clock towers to the hustle-and-bustle of a Paris train station without thinking of Scorsese, another lonely boy, staring out of his bedroom window on Elizabeth Street. And even if you're not a big enough film nerd to make that connection, I really feel like Hugo's journey is not in finding a new father figure, but in persisting with the mechanical magic that stands as his own father's legacy. That's what film is: The persistence of vision that allows us to accept an illusory version of the world at 24 frames per second is science and magic at once. Hugo's relationship with Méliès isn't about him cozying up to a new daddy, but sharing a common enthusiasm the old man has submerged in bitterness. To me, that's a far more unique angle on a potentially shopworn premise.<br/><br/>Did you really find none of Hugo enchanting? Even the film's few detractors seem willing to admit that the sequences evoking cinema history and Méliès' studio—with Michael Stuhlbarg as the heroic film scholar!—were terrific. It felt, in the best possible way, like a heady compression of my History Of Film 101 class in college, condensing a semester's worth of clips and context into something between a montage and an animated pop-up book. And it speaks to the ingenious design of the film, which layers fact and fantasy so beautifully that it's at once a history of Méliès and the birth of cinema, and just the sort of simple, sumptuously produced cinematic wonder that Scorsese himself would have loved as a child. Thank goodness Hugo doesn't follow the Jeunet/Luhrmann model and have "a sense of its own ridiculousness." As a fantasy connoisseur yourself, wouldn't you say there's value in playing it straight and earnest and unabashed rather than winking at the audience? You may find Hugo sickly sweet, but I don't think the authenticity of its sentiment is to be denied.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Tasha: Yes, I did in fact find parts of Hugo enchanting. (Notice how I'm answering your question up front, whereas you were too busy frothing with apoplexy to address mine, though I assume that's an answer in its own right. Okay, "influence" may be overstating the case—I just meant the visual style looked very familiar. Though as Keith pointed out when you brought this up in person, Scorsese is neither opposed to drawing inspiration from other people's visuals, nor immune to it.) Primarily, I was enchanted by the parts dealing with Georges Méliès' backstory, with his love of cinema, with the work he put into his art and the joy he got out of it. There's an awful lot of beauty and fun in the staging of the underwater-court scene from Méliès' "Fairyland," and in the sequence at the end, focusing on Méliès footage. I'll grant you that Hugo's connection with Méliès over a shared love of film is a nice touch. And I do enjoy a good film about filmmaking.<br/><br/>But Hugo isn't primarily about film, in spite of the Méliès tie-ins. In addition to the themes you cite, it's also about finding your purpose, as the characters expressly, laboriously explain to each other and to us. And it's about spectacle, and big action setpieces, and chases, and happily-ever-after endings where even the angry bully and the shy older couple and fergawdsakes even the cranky dachshund all get paired off with charming love interests by the end. It's about the super-precocious Hermione Granger-type being bossy and perky and clever and praising the magical worlds encased in books. And all of this business is mighty familiar, and mighty artificial.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Yes, Scorsese is playing with archetypes. Problem is, I never felt he imbued them with anything new, fresh, or believable, in spite of his own backstory. I would have much preferred a story about a young Scorsese growing up with asthma—something small-scale and real, without vast rooms full of CGI clockwork and golden glowing dust-motes and prophetic dreams and a raging adult tyrant-guard with a heart of gold—all of that outsized, over-the-top nonsense. You keep citing Scorsese's personal background and love of film as evidence that he's really feeling what he's putting on the screen, but I don't feel his personal touch in any of this, except the moments that are expressly about film. The core emotions may be real, but that doesn't make the execution less false.<br/><br/>You say the authenticity of the emotion isn't to be denied. I don't question whether Scorsese personally felt lonely and isolated as a child, but I don't feel loneliness and isolation on the screen—I see a bunch of exaggerated signifiers (Hugo is filthy and his clothes are worn and all the adults yell at him and he regularly gets chased by a scary dog!) and big beats, with shouting and weeping and Spielbergian wonder-emoting. For me, sincerity is more convincing and more personal when it's quiet and direct; when someone's shouting his opinions at me, I assume he's either really angry, or just trying to overwhelm my senses to keep me from expressing my own opinion. Hugo was one long shout, as far as I was concerned.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Why didn't I get that sense of fakery from Amélie, you ask? Actually, I did. I'll completely acknowledge that Amélie and Moulin Rouge are both big, manipulative, artificial constructions in the exact same vein, demanding specific emotions at specific intervals, and trying to sell those emotions with heavy emoting and aggressive soundtrack prodding. Neither of them really sold me on their emotions as authentic human feeling. What I enjoyed in those two films was the construction—particularly Amélie's heady, laughable lists of random characterizing features and experiences for its cast, and Moulin Rouge's musical-magpie mashups and recontextualizations. I'm often sold on stories that do creative or ambitious things with structure, and both of those movies qualify, where Hugo is a much more linear, standard kid-quest.<br/><br/>But in the end, for me, it really does come down to a feeling that those movies are goofs, whereas Hugo is meant to be taken seriously at every treacly moment. You don't think that's true—but you're simultaneously defending its integrity in terms of its absolutely authentic, rooted-in-Scorsese's-history emotion, and telling me I'm wrong, and he doesn't mean it to be taken seriously. How do you reconcile those two statements? What about the film suggests to you that it isn't meant to be taken at face value? And is it possible this is just another Curious Case Of Benjamin Button-like situation where I find the use of kids in big-budget films to be largely sappy and melodramatic, whereas you as a dad find it bypasses your cynicism and goes straight to your family-feeling?<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Scott: Not sure I meant that Scorsese doesn't mean to be taken seriously; it's just that he's chosen a whimsical vehicle through which to express a serious love of the movies. When you say, "But Hugo isn't primarily about film, in spite of the Méliès tie-ins," I'm mystified. I grant that you find many elements of Hugo overly familiar and laborious and full of Spielbergian wonder-emoting—there's nothing I can do to argue around that perception, which other Hugo doubters share. Sometimes a film means to charm and enchant, and it doesn't for some; you've got Hugo and I've got Amélie, though I think the latter, deliberately artificial as it is, means for us to find it romantic. (Rather than, say, some horrible mechanical contraption fit for a Saw sequel.)<br/><br/>But to say Hugo isn't primarily about film? If it's not about film, then it's the most pointlessly discursive story about [whatever you think it's about] I've ever seen. The relationship between Hugo and Méliès is the heart of the movie, and at the heart of that is not just some stock connection between Plucky Orphan and Crusty Old Guy With A Heart Of Gold, but a shared affinity for engineered magic—specifically the magic of the movies. I think Scorsese and his collaborators have found a way to express their enthusiasm over the early days of cinema through a fantasy that's accessible to all ages. The archetype-filled children's tale is the merely the crust here; cinema is the pie. (Mmmm… pie.)<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>As for The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button, I don't see much of a connection, other than trying to expose me as a Benjamin Button defender as a way of damaging my credibility. (Incidentally, how are the extras on that G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra Blu-ray?) I've said to you that the sleep-deprived new dad in me was perhaps vulnerable to Benjamin Button, but I can't imagine a time when the premise of aging in reverse wouldn't move me. (Cradling the love of your life in your arms as an infant? How can you not be affected by that?) And besides, I don't see how Benjamin Button relates much to Hugo as a film concerning kids, since that's just a small segment of a story that spans a much larger trajectory.<br/><br/>So have I convinced you? Likely not. But I'm happy to learn that Hugo wasn't entirely devoid of enchantments for you. The sequences on Méliès the filmmaker are what put Hugo over for me—and in that, at least, we can share some movie love.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Tasha: Nope, I can't say you've convinced me, any more than I've convinced you. It's impossible to argue anyone into a visceral love of anything, and it really should be equally impossible to talk someone down from visceral love. Mostly, you've let me see Hugo in Scott-O-Vision, which is an interesting experience; at least now I'm mildly convinced that we didn't somehow manage to see entirely different films which both somehow had the same name and director.<br/><br/>We certainly had different experiences, though, and to my mind, focused on different aspects of the production: I still don't see the "film is marvelous" theme as the movie's single strand, so much as one among too many. "Pointlessly discursive" almost covers it, though I'd throw in "often needlessly cutesy and precious" on top of that. While you're focused on the film's tasty pie filling, I feel like that pie was covered with a pound of crystallized sugar, and I think that does make a difference, regardless of the film's core message or handful of terrific scenes. See also Benjamin Button, which I did not bring up just to chafe you—I really do think you have more of a sentimental streak than I do regarding children in cinema, especially when they're used more as symbols of vulnerability and innocence than as human characters. Hey, you know what film totally does not have cute wide-eyed moppets bringing hope to a cynical world? G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra. Maybe I will go watch those Blu-ray extras. I could use some explosion-insulin to compensate for Hugo's sweetness. | Birisini nefret ettikleri bir şeyi sevmenin imkansız olduğunu kabul etmekle birlikte, tam tersi, tartışmayı denemek yine de çoğu zaman zevklidir. Görüşleri bizimkilerle doğrudan çelişen insanlarla konuştuğumuzda, zevklerimizi savunmak, görüşlerimizi tanımlamak ve neden bu şekilde tepki verdiğimizi analiz etmek zorunda kalıyoruz. İşte bu yüzden neden bunu sevmiyorsun?, iki personelimiz, karşıt görüşlere sahip insanların "Hayır, yanılıyorsun!"un ötesine geçip geçemeyeceğini keşfetmeye çalışacaklar ve tartışma noktaları hakkında medeni, yapıcı ve hatta muhtemelen ikna edici bir tartışmaya sahip olacaklar. Çünkü telsiz ne derse desin, "Tamamen aynı fikirdeyiz" ile "Haklıyım ve sen aptal ve kötüsün" arasında hala bir orta yol var.<br/><br/>Scott: Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World apostasy'yi tartıştığımdan beri, harika bir şeyi sevmediğim için sizi çağırabileceğim bir dava arıyorduk ve uzun süre aramamıza gerek yoktu. Martin Scorsese'nin Hugo-me'si sırasında yan yana oturuyorduk, erken sessiz sinemanın harikalarına yaptığı fantastik övgüden tamamen büyülenmiştik ve görünüşe göre her seferinde ona direniyordunuz. Eleştirel konsensüs benim tarafımda oldu: Toplu Top 15'teki 9 numaralı noktaya çarptı (aşırı dereceli seçiminiz olarak listeleseniz de), çeşitli film eleştiri ödüllerinde kazandı (veya yerleştirildi) ve şu anda Metacritic'te 83 puan aldı. Bu yanıldığın anlamına gelmez, tabii ki, ama Hugo'nun neden sizin deyiminizle "kutsal ve yapay" olduğunu açıklamak için, birçoğumuzun Scorsese'nin çocukluğunun ve henüz bebekliğindeykenki ortamın sevimli bir daveti olarak gördüğü. Ve lütfen bu kelebeği kanatlarından parçalarken nazik olun.<br/><br/>Reklam<br/><br/>Tasha: Nazik olamam, Scott. Band-Aid'i bir kerede koparırsan bazen daha az acıtır. (Ve olmasa bile, kim yarım yamalak Band-Aid giyerken dolaşmak ister? Gross.) Gerçek şu ki, Hugo'yu sahtecilikte bıkkınca manipülatif bir egzersiz olarak buldum, bir Paris tren istasyonundaki açılış kaymasından başlayarak, bu bana Robert Zemeckis'in Kutup Ekspresi'ni her şeyden daha çok hatırlattı. Mike D'Angelo'nun aksine, bir alan oluşturmanın ve izleyicileri bir kamera bir alanı keşfederken bilinçsizce nefeslerini tutmaya teşvik etmenin bir yolu olarak uzun, kırılmamış çekimlerin bir hayranıyım; ancak araştırılan alan kaygan, parlak bir CGI yaratımı olduğunda ve kamera, kameranın ya da çevrenin gerçekten orada olduğu fiziksel bir anlam taşımadan, bir başkasının bir video oyunu oynamasını izlemek gibi hissetmeye başlar. Ve filmin geri kalanı, hem ayarı açısından hem de son derece uydurulmuş, maudlin hikayesi açısından bana benzer şekilde gözeneksiz ve gerçek dışı geldi.<br/><br/>Filmde üretilmiş, stilize edilmiş ortamlarla ilgili bir sorunum yok. Baz Luhrmann'ın Moulin Rouge'daki Paris'i eşit derecede yayılan, tamamen yapay bir şekilde ele almasını sevdim, ancak bu filmin kendi gülünçlüğü, ne kadar kasten aşırı olduğunu anlatan bir mizah anlayışı var. Özellikle Amelie'de Jean-Pierre Jeunet'in stilize edilmesiydi. (Hem Jeunet hem de Luhrmann burada güçlü görsel etkiler hissetti.) Bununla birlikte, Martin Scorsese'nin Hugo'yu tamamen ciddiye almamı istediği hissine kapıldım. Yine de, huysuz, yaşlı bir curmudgeon'un hayatına renk katan cesur bir yetimin acı veren bir duygusal hikayesi.<br/><br/>Reklam<br/><br/>Filmde şaşırmaktan daha çok zevk aldığım hiçbir şey yok. Ve açıkça manipüle edilmekten, ne hissedeceğim ve ne zaman hissedeceğim konusunda yüksek sesle söylenmekten daha fazla gücendiğim ve direndiğim hiçbir şey yok. İyi bir film bu tür şeyleri incelikle yapar; Kötü bir film, müzik ipuçlarını ve tatlı telleri çarparak kullanır - ve bu durumda, huysuz, kocaman gözlü, lekeli bir yetim, kameraya kederli bir şekilde bakıyor - pathos talep etmek ve izleyicilere talep üzerine hizmet etmezlerse korkunç insanlar olduklarını söylemek için. Bununla birlikte, üzgün çocuklarla ve huysuz yetişkinlerin birbirleri için hayatı daha iyi hale getirmeleriyle başa çıkabilirim - bu yılki Le Havre'ı gerçekten kazdım, ki bu aslında tüm sevimlilikler olmadan aynı arsaydı - ama yapay ortamların yapay duygulara kötü yansıttığını ve her birinin sırayla birbirlerini daha sahte gösterdiğini görüyorum.<br/><br/>Bununla başlayalım. Gözden kaçan film videomuzda, sen ve Noel, hem Keith'i Tyrannosaur'u şampiyon olarak göreve getirdiniz, çünkü bunun yeterince gerçekçi olmadığını hissettiniz - çok hileli, çok miserablist, çok fazla, çok uzak. Sinirlendiğinde bir şeyleri kıran, ama dev bir tren istasyonu saatinin içinde yaşayan ve ölü babasından sırlar taşıyabileceğine inandığı gizemli bir otomatı tamir etmek için kaprisli bir yolculuğa çıkan bir yetimi satın alamazsınız, ancak bunun yerine kendini keşfetmenin ilginç bir yolculuğunda sinemanın büyülü topraklarına götürebilir misiniz? Hugo'nun şatafatlı rokoko tasarımını, agresif kalp atışlarını ya da biraz aşırı ya da yutulması zor olan el arabası yığınlarını hiç bulamadınız mı?<br/><br/>Reklam<br/><br/>Scott: Jeunet ve Luhrmann Scorsese etkileri olarak?! İnkâr etmeyi unutun, şimdi bilerek keskin bir sopa ile beni dürtüyorsunuz. Hugo için ilham almak istiyorsanız -aslında Hugo'nun duygusal çekirdeğini arıyorsanız - Scorsese'nin Küçük İtalya'daki Elizabeth Caddesi'ndeki çocukluğuna geri dönmelisiniz, burada diğer çocuklarla dışarıda oynayamayan astımlı küçük bir çocuk, Bagdad Hırsızı gibi Alexander Korda fantezilerine çekildi. Ya da, daha basitçe, doğrudan kaynağa gidin: A Trip To The Moon, tüm sinematik fantezilerin Big Bang'i olarak kalır, o anda kamera dünyayı olduğu gibi belgelemek için kullanılmaz, ama ne olursa olsun kaprisli, büyülü, nakliye yeri bir film yapımcısı bunun için icat etmek istiyor. Ve bu gelenek, Jeunet ve Luhrmann'ın iğrenç küçük pençelerini almadan önce on yıllar boyunca geliştirildi ve genişletildi.<br/><br/>Jeunet'ten bahsetmişken, retorik silahımı elimden almak için güzel bir girişim, ama yine de şunu söyleyeceğim: Amlie'yi nasıl sevebilirsin, yine de Hugo'yu sentetik ve "aşırı" ve "yorgunlukla manipülatif" bulabilir misin? Amelie ve Moulin Rouge'un, Scorsese'nin Hugo'yu ciddiye almamızı ifade ettiği "kendi gülünçlüklerini" affettiğini söylüyorsunuz ve bence durum bu değil, en azından ikinci noktada. Scorsese'nin filmlerle ilgili bariz bir tutku hissetmesi, sanırım Hugo'yu neden kendini ciddi olarak yorumladığını gösteriyor. Ama bana göre, Luhrmann ve Jeunet filmlerinin sahip olmadığı duygusal bir denge sağlayan bu duygular. Her üç film de CGI'nin harikalarını agresif bir şekilde kullanıyor - ve Scorsese karışıma 3D ekliyor, harika bir etkiye - ama sen ve benim farklı olduğumuz yer ağırlıksızlık meselesi. CGI'nin mesafeli bir etkiye sahip olduğunu kabul ediyorum; tamamen dijital plastikten oluşan dünyalar, bazen varlıklarının olmadığı bir noktaya kadar esnektir. En İyi Film parçamız için "Aşırı" girişinizde Hugo'dan "bir CGI gimcrack" olarak bahsettiniz - mükemmel bir dis ... başka bir film için.<br/><br/>Reklam<br/><br/>Scorsese'nin Hugo'yu standart bir meselenin etrafında inşa ettiğini söylemek doğru olur, "kalp bükme" çocuk kitabı / film arsası: Yetim babasını özlüyor, kendi küçük fantezi dünyasını yaratıyor, yeni bir arkadaşa glooms, yumuşaması ve belki de onu benimsemesi için kabuklu yaşlı bir kankayı ikna ediyor. Ama bu sadece anlatı iskeleti ve Scorsese bol miktarda et ve kan sağlıyor. Birincisi, Hugo'yu izleyemezsiniz, yalnız çocuk, saat kulelerinden, bir Paris tren istasyonunun koşuşturmacasına bakarken, başka bir yalnız çocuk olan Scorsese'yi Elizabeth Caddesi'ndeki yatak odası penceresinden dışarı bakıyor. Ve bu bağlantıyı kuracak kadar büyük bir film ineği olmasan bile, Hugo'nun yolculuğunun yeni bir baba figürü bulmak değil, kendi babasının mirası olarak duran mekanik büyüyle devam etmek olduğunu hissediyorum. Film budur: Dünyanın aldatıcı bir versiyonunu saniyede 24 karede kabul etmemizi sağlayan vizyonun sürekliliği, aynı anda bilim ve sihirdir. Hugo'nun Melies'le ilişkisi onun yeni bir babaya yakınlaşmasıyla ilgili değil, ama yaşlı adamın acı içinde battığı ortak bir coşkuyu paylaşmakla ilgili. Bana göre, bu potansiyel olarak alışverişle ilgili bir öncülde çok daha benzersiz bir açı.<br/><br/>Gerçekten Hugo'nun büyüleyici hiçbirini bulamadınız mı? Filmin birkaç detractor'u bile sinema tarihini ve Mikail Stuhlbarg'ın stüdyosunu çağrıştıran sekansların kahraman film bilgini olduğunu kabul etmeye istekli görünüyor! - muhteşemdi. Bu, mümkün olan en iyi şekilde, üniversitedeki History Of Film 101 dersinin baş döndürücü bir sıkıştırması gibi, bir dönemin klip ve bağlamını bir montaj ve animasyonlu bir pop-up kitap arasındaki bir şeye yoğunlaştırdı. Ve filmin ustaca tasarımına hitap ediyor, bu da gerçeği ve fanteziyi o kadar güzel bir şekilde katmanlıyor ki, bu bir anda Mîlis'in ve sinemanın doğuşunun bir tarihi ve Scorsese'nin kendisinin çocukken seveceği basit, özet bir şekilde üretilmiş sinema harikası. Şükürler olsun ki Hugo, Jeunet/Luhrmann modelini takip etmiyor ve "kendi gülünçlüğü"ne sahip. Bir fantezi uzmanı olarak, seyirciye göz kırpmak yerine düz, ciddi ve acımasız oynamanın bir değeri olduğunu söylemez misiniz? Hugo'yu hastalıklı bir şekilde tatlı bulabilirsiniz, ancak duygularının orijinalliğinin inkar edilmesi gerektiğini düşünmüyorum.<br/><br/>Reklam<br/><br/>Tasha: Evet, aslında Hugo'nun büyüleyici kısımlarını buldum. (Soruna nasıl cevap verdiğime dikkat et, oysa sen benimkini ele almak için apopleksiyle çok meşguldün, gerçi bunun kendi başına bir cevap olduğunu varsayıyorum. Tamam, "etki" davayı abartıyor olabilir - sadece görsel tarzın çok tanıdık geldiğini kastettim. Keith'in bunu şahsen gündeme getirdiğinde belirttiği gibi, Scorsese ne başkalarının görsellerinden ilham almaya karşıdır ne de buna karşıdır.) Her şeyden önce, Georges Malis'in geçmişiyle, sinema sevgisiyle, sanatına kattığı işlerle ve onun içinden çıktığı neşeyle ilgilenen parçalar beni büyülemişti. "Fairyland" filminden sualtı sahası sahnesinin sahnelenmesinde ve sonundaki dizide, "Mali"nin görüntülerine odaklanan çok fazla güzellik ve eğlence var. Hugo'nun, ortak bir film aşkı uğruna Melies'le olan bağlantısının hoş bir dokunuş olduğunu kabul ediyorum ve film yapımı hakkında iyi bir film yapmaktan hoşlanıyorum.<br/><br/>Ama Hugo esas olarak filmle ilgili değil, her ne kadar Mîs kravatlarına rağmen. Bahsettiğiniz temalara ek olarak, aynı zamanda amacınızı bulmakla da ilgilidir, karakterlerin açıkça, birbirlerine ve bize açıkladıkları gibi. Ve gösteri, büyük aksiyon set parçaları ve kovalamacalar ve kızgın kabadayı ve utangaç yaşlı çift ve fergawdsakes bile huysuz dachshund'un sonunda büyüleyici aşk çıkarlarıyla eşleştiği mutlu sonlarla ilgili. Süper-değerli Hermione Granger tipinin patronluk taslayan, perkin ve zeki olması ve kitaplarda kaplanmış büyülü dünyaları övmesiyle ilgilidir. Ve tüm bu işler çok tanıdık ve güçlü yapaydır.<br/><br/>Reklam<br/><br/>Evet, Scorsese arketiplerle oynuyor. Sorun şu ki, kendi geçmişine rağmen onları yeni, taze veya inandırıcı bir şeyle donattığını hiç hissetmedim. Astımla büyüyen genç bir Scorsese hakkında bir hikayeyi çok tercih ederdim - küçük ve gerçek bir şey, CGI saat çalışmalarıyla dolu geniş odalar ve altın parlayan toz dumanları ve peygamberlik hayalleri ve altın kalpli öfkeli bir yetişkin tiran muhafızı - tüm bu abartılmış, üstü kapalı saçmalıklar. Scorsese'nin kişisel geçmişini ve film sevgisini, ekrana ne koyduğunu gerçekten hissettiğinin bir kanıtı olarak göstermeye devam ediyorsun, ama onun kişisel dokunuşunu hiçbir şeyde hissetmiyorum, filmle ilgili açıkça olan anlar hariç. Çekirdek duygular gerçek olabilir, ancak bu yürütmeyi daha az yanlış yapmaz.<br/><br/>Duyguların özgünlüğünün inkar edilemeyeceğini söylüyorsunuz. Scorsese'nin çocukken kişisel olarak yalnız ve izole hissedip hissetmediğini sorgulamıyorum, ancak ekranda yalnızlık ve izolasyon hissetmiyorum - bir sürü abartılı işaretçi görüyorum (Hugo pis ve kıyafetleri giyiliyor ve tüm yetişkinler ona bağırıyor ve düzenli olarak korkunç bir köpek tarafından kovalanıyor!) ve büyük vuruşlar, bağırarak ve ağlayarak ve Spielberg harikası ile. Benim için samimiyet, sessiz ve doğrudan olduğunda daha ikna edici ve daha kişiseldir; biri bana fikirlerini bağırdığında, ya gerçekten kızgın olduğunu ya da sadece kendi fikrimi ifade etmeme engel olmak için duygularımı bastırmaya çalıştığını varsayıyorum. Hugo bana göre uzun bir bağırıştı.<br/><br/>Reklam<br/><br/>- Neden Amelie'den o sahtekârlık hissini alamadım ki? Amelie ve Moulin Rouge'un aynı damarda hem büyük, manipülatif, hem de yapay yapılar olduklarını, belirli aralıklarla belirli duygular talep ettiklerini ve bu duyguları ağır emoting ve agresif soundtrack proding ile satmaya çalıştıklarını tamamen kabul edeceğim. İkisi de beni gerçek bir insan hissi olarak duygularına satmadı. Bu iki filmde hoşuma giden şey, özellikle Amelie'nin oyuncu kadrosu için rastgele karakterize edici özellikler ve deneyimler içeren baş döndürücü, gülünç listeleri ve Moulin Rouge'un müzikal-magpie mashupları ve yeniden metinleştirmeleriydi. Genellikle yapı ile yaratıcı ya da iddialı şeyler yapan hikayelere satılırım ve bu filmlerin her ikisi de Hugo'nun çok daha doğrusal, standart bir çocuk isteği olduğu niteliklidir.<br/><br/>Ama sonunda, benim için, bu filmlerin aptal olduğu hissine kapıldım, oysa Hugo her treacly anında ciddiye alınmak isteniyor. Bunun doğru olduğunu düşünmüyorsunuz - ama aynı zamanda onun kesinlikle otantik, köklü-in-Scorsesese'nin-tarihi duygusu açısından bütünlüğünü savunuyorsunuz ve bana yanıldığımı söylüyor ve ciddiye alınması anlamına gelmiyor. Bu iki ifadeyi nasıl uzlaştırırsınız? Film size bunun yüz değerinde alınmaması gerektiğini düşündürüyor. Ve bunun, büyük bütçeli filmlerde çocukların kullanımını büyük ölçüde özensiz ve melodramatik bulduğum Benjamin Button benzeri bir başka Meraklı Durum olması mümkün mü? Oysa sen bir baba olarak kinikliğini atlar ve doğrudan aile duygularına gider.<br/><br/>Reklam<br/><br/>Scott: Scorsese'nin ciddiye alınmak anlamına gelmediğinden emin değilim; sadece filmlerin ciddi bir sevgisini ifade etmek için kaprisli bir araç seçti. "Ama Hugo esas olarak filmle ilgili değil, Meli'nin kravatlarına rağmen" dediğinizde, ben gizemliyim. Hugo'nun pek çok unsurunu aşırı derecede tanıdık, zahmetli ve Spielberg harikası duygularıyla dolu bulduğunuzu kabul ediyorum - diğer Hugo kuşkucularının paylaştığı bu algı etrafında tartışmak için yapabileceğim hiçbir şey yok. Bazen bir film çekicilik ve büyü anlamına gelir ve bazıları için öyle değildir; Hugo'ya ve Amelie'ye sahipsin, ama bence ikincisi, kasıtlı olarak yapay olduğu gibi, romantik bulmamız anlamına gelir. (Söylemek yerine, bir Testere devam filmi için uygun korkunç mekanik bir mekanizma.)<br/><br/>Ama Hugo'nun esas olarak filmle ilgili olmadığını söylemek için? Eğer filmle ilgili değilse, o zaman [ne hakkında olduğunu düşündüğünüzle ilgili] şimdiye kadar izlediğim en anlamsız şekilde çelişkili hikayedir. Hugo ve Melies arasındaki ilişki filmin kalbidir ve bunun kalbinde sadece Plucky Orphan ve Crusty Old Guy With A Heart Of Gold arasındaki hisse senedi bağlantısı değil, aynı zamanda mühendislik büyüsü için ortak bir yakınlık vardır - özellikle de filmlerin büyüsü. Bence Scorsese ve işbirlikçileri, sinemanın ilk günlerindeki coşkularını her yaştan insanın erişebileceği bir fantezi aracılığıyla ifade etmenin bir yolunu buldular. Arketip dolu çocuk masalı buradaki sadece kabuktur; sinema turtadır. (Mmmm... turta.)<br/><br/>Reklam<br/><br/>The Curious Case of Benjamin Button'a gelince, beni bir Benjamin Button savunucusu olarak güvenilirliğime zarar vermenin bir yolu olarak ifşa etmekten başka bir bağlantı görmüyorum. (Kazaradan, o G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra Blu-ray'deki ekstralar nasıl?) İçimdeki uykudan yoksun yeni babanın belki de Benjamin Button'a karşı savunmasız olduğunu söyledim, ama tersine yaşlanmanın öncülünün beni hareket ettiremeyeceği bir zaman hayal edemiyorum. Bundan nasıl etkilenmezsiniz?) Ayrıca, Benjamin Button'ın Hugo ile çocukları ilgilendiren bir film olarak nasıl çok fazla ilişki kurduğunu anlamıyorum, çünkü bu çok daha büyük bir yörüngeyi kapsayan bir hikayenin sadece küçük bir bölümü.<br/><br/>Ben de seni ikna ettim mi? Muhtemelen değil. Ama Hugo'nun senin için büyülerden tamamen yoksun olmadığını öğrendiğim için mutluyum. Film yapımcısı Möli's'teki diziler Hugo'yu benim için ortaya koydu - ve en azından, biraz film aşkı paylaşabiliriz.<br/><br/>Reklam<br/><br/>Tasha: Hayır, seni ikna ettiğimden daha fazla beni ikna ettiğini söyleyemem. Herhangi bir şeye karşı içten bir aşka kimseyi tartışmak mümkün değildir ve birini içten sevgiden aşağı konuşmak da eşit derecede imkansız olmalıdır. Çoğunlukla, ilginç bir deneyim olan Scott-O-Vision'da Hugo'yu görmeme izin verdiniz; en azından şimdi, her ikisinin de bir şekilde aynı adı ve yönetmeni olan tamamen farklı filmleri görmeyi bir şekilde başaramadığımıza ikna oldum.<br/><br/>Yine de kesinlikle farklı deneyimler yaşadık ve bana göre, prodüksiyonun farklı yönlerine odaklandık: "film muhteşem" temasını hala filmin tek iplikçiği olarak görmüyorum, çok fazla film arasında bir tane. "Pointlessly discursive" neredeyse onu kapsar, ama bunun üzerine "genellikle gereksiz sevimli ve değerli" atardım. Sen filmin lezzetli turta dolgusuna odaklanırken, o turtanın bir kilo kristalize şekerle kaplandığını hissediyorum ve bence bu, filmin ana mesajına veya bir avuç muhteşem sahneye bakılmaksızın bir fark yaratıyor. Ayrıca Benjamin Button'a da bakın, ki bu konuyu sadece sizi rahatsız etmek için açmadım - sinemadaki çocuklarla ilgili olarak benden daha duygusal bir çizgiye sahip olduğunuzu düşünüyorum, özellikle de insan karakterlerinden daha fazla savunmasızlık ve masumiyet sembolü olarak kullanıldıklarında. Hey, hangi film kesinlikle alaycı bir dünyaya umut getiren sevimli geniş gözlü kuklalara sahip değil biliyor musun? G.I. Joe: Kobra'nın Yükselişi. Belki gidip şu Blu-ray ekstralarını izlerim. Hugo'nun tatlılığını telafi etmek için biraz patlama-insülin kullanabilirim. |
| "I hoped my daughter would be free from difficult and troubling times": Mee Mee's story as a refugee Mom<br/><br/>Hope in Times of Crisis: A Mother's Day Story<br/><br/>By Judith Santiago*<br/><br/>Mee Mee heard that the soldiers were coming. She took hold of her son and frantically joined the rest of the villagers who were running toward the Thai-Burmese border, where the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) was located. Her husband was in another village running in the opposite direction, Mee later learned. After the soldiers' pursuit ended, Mee returned home to her small village in Koechi, Burma.<br/><br/>During 1997-2000, Mee and thousands like her lived under the constant threat of violence from Burmese soldiers. Many people would take temporary refuge in the jungle, and return home to their village after soldiers left the area, just to do it all over again days later. About once a week, Mee and others would be on the move to avoid capture, rape, or death by soldiers.<br/><br/>During one incident, Mee's husband ran ahead of his wife to secure food for his family. Her husband was spotted by soldiers and shot. The bullet shattered a portion of his ribcage, leaving him severely wounded and in distress as he journeyed toward the jungle with his family for safety.<br/><br/>For three months, Mee's husband hid and moved the family with an exasperating wound at his side. He received no medical care, except for Mee's tending.<br/><br/>"I was afraid to return to Burma," Mee said through an interpreter. "I feared dying. I cried and cried every day," she continued.<br/><br/>Mee's husband eventually drew enough strength to walk five days toward a small village in Thailand where they learned the location of a hospital and a refugee camp. When Mee and her husband finally arrived at the hospital, he underwent immediate surgery and later recovered.<br/><br/>Symbol of Hope<br/><br/>Life in the jungle for those fleeing Burmese soldiers was indeed terrifying and difficult. Makeshift bamboo tents with only roof and floor coverings became suitable temporary dwellings. Many women including Mee gave birth to children in the jungle. Mee's then six-year-old son assisted in the delivery of his sister named Eh Ku Hser. Her name means love – cold – sweet. "Cold" in Burmese culture means so as to not pass through the fire of life, as heat represents troubled times.<br/><br/>"I hoped my daughter would be free from difficult and troubling times," said Mee. "I did not want her to go through what I had experienced," she continued.<br/><br/>For Mee, the birth of her daughter in the midst of darkness, torment and fear, was a symbol of hope for a new life to come. Hope in times of crisis, the very premise of the United Methodist Committee on Relief's (UMCOR) newly co-branded UMCOR-Prosperity Candle, is also the essence of that which candles shed light upon.<br/><br/>A New Beginning<br/><br/>With the help of UNHCR, hope for a new life did indeed materialize for Mee and her family when they resettled in West Springfield, Massachusetts. There, Mee met Moo Kho Paw, another woman who emigrated from Burma, and who was working at Prosperity Candle in Florence. The organization helps refugee women who have escaped areas of conflict rebuild their lives through the art of candle making. Moo Kho recommended that Mee join the organization, and Mee gladly accepted.<br/><br/>"I was excited to be out of the house," said Mee, "I was raised to believe that because I was a woman, my role was to remain at home and raise my family," she continued. "While many Burmese women want to do more for themselves, they are often encouraged to remain homemakers."<br/><br/>Today, Mee has plans to go into the candle-making business for herself and support her five children, but she expressed the need to learn English first.<br/><br/>"In the Thai refugee camp, we had education, but it was not so good," said Mee. "When I was a child, I wanted to go to school, but I was told to stay home because I was a woman. Now, I have hopes for my daughters to go to college and become doctors or policewomen," continued Mee.<br/><br/>Mee has struck an even balance in her life that she wishes others would have found—a simple, happy life where work, caring for family members and freedom of choice all have their place.<br/><br/>Support Refugee Women in the US<br/><br/>Share this Mother's Day story with your loved ones. And, when you purchase handmade candles by Mee, Moo Kho, and Naw, another Burmese refugee woman working at Prosperity Candle , know you are helping to support their livelihood as they rebuild their lives and those of their family members in the US. | "Kızımın zor ve sıkıntılı zamanlardan kurtulacağını ummuştum": Mee Mee'nin mülteci bir anne olarak hikayesi<br/><br/>Kriz Döneminde Umut: Bir Anneler Günü Hikayesi<br/><br/>Judith Santiago tarafından*<br/><br/>Mee Mee askerlerin geldiğini duydu. Oğlunu ele geçirdi ve Birleşmiş Milletler Mülteciler Yüksek Komiserliği'nin (UNHCR) bulunduğu Tayland-Burma sınırına doğru koşan köylülerin geri kalanına çılgınca katıldı. Kocası ters yönde koşan başka bir köydeydi, Mee daha sonra öğrendi. Askerlerin takibi sona erdikten sonra Mee, Burma'nın Koechi kentindeki küçük köyüne döndü.<br/><br/>1997-2000 yılları arasında Mee ve onun gibi binlerce kişi, Burma askerlerinin sürekli şiddet tehdidi altında yaşadı. Birçok insan ormana geçici olarak sığınır ve askerler bölgeyi terk ettikten sonra sadece günler sonra tekrar yapmak için köylerine geri dönerlerdi. Haftada yaklaşık bir kez, Mee ve diğerleri askerler tarafından yakalanmaktan, tecavüzden veya ölümden kaçınmak için harekete geçeceklerdi.<br/><br/>Bir olay sırasında, Mee'nin kocası, ailesi için yiyecek sağlamak için karısının önüne koştu. Kocası askerler tarafından fark edildi ve vuruldu. Mermi, kaburgasının bir kısmını parçaladı ve ailesi ile birlikte ormana doğru güvenli bir şekilde giderken onu ağır yaralı ve sıkıntılı bir halde bıraktı.<br/><br/>Üç ay boyunca, Mee'nin kocası saklandı ve aileyi yanında kızgın bir yara ile taşıdı. Mee'nin bakımı dışında hiçbir tıbbi bakım almadı.<br/><br/>Mee bir tercüman aracılığıyla "Burma'ya dönmekten korktum" dedi. "Ölmekten korktum. Her gün ağladım ve ağladım." diye devam etti.<br/><br/>Mee'nin kocası sonunda Tayland'daki küçük bir köye doğru beş gün yürüyecek kadar güçlendi ve burada bir hastanenin ve bir mülteci kampının yerini öğrendiler.

Birmanya kültüründe "Soğuk", yaşam ateşinden geçmemek anlamına gelir, çünkü ısı sorunlu zamanları temsil eder.<br/><br/>Mee, "Kızımın zor ve sıkıntılı zamanlardan kurtulacağını ummuştum," diyerek şöyle devam etti: "Yaşadığım şeyleri yaşamasını istemedim."<br/><br/>Mee için kızının karanlığın, işkencenin ve korkunun ortasında doğumu, yeni bir hayatın gelmesi umudunun sembolüydü.

Orada Mee, Burma'dan göç eden ve Floransa'daki Refah Mumu'nda çalışan başka bir kadın olan Moo Kho Paw ile tanıştı. Örgüt, çatışma bölgelerinden kaçan mülteci kadınların mum yapma sanatı aracılığıyla hayatlarını yeniden inşa etmelerine yardımcı oluyor. Moo Kho, Mee'nin örgüte katılmasını önerdi ve Mee memnuniyetle kabul etti.<br/><br/>Mee, "Evden çıktığım için heyecanlandım," dedi, "kadın olduğum için rolümün evde kalıp ailemi büyütmek olduğuna inanmak için yetiştirildim." Birçok Burmalı kadın kendileri için daha fazla şey yapmak isterken, genellikle ev hanımı olarak kalmaya teşvik ediliyorlar.<br/><br/>Bugün, Mee'nin kendisi için mum yapımı işine girme ve beş çocuğunu destekleme planları var, ancak önce İngilizce öğrenme ihtiyacını dile getirdi.<br/><br/>Mee, "Tayland mülteci kampında eğitim aldık, ama o kadar da iyi değildi." diyerek şöyle devam etti: "Çocukken okula gitmek istedim, ama bir kadın olduğum için evde kalmam söylendi. Şimdi, kızlarımın üniversiteye gidip doktor ya da polis kadın olması için umutlarım var," diye devam etti Mee.<br/><br/>Mee, hayatında başkalarının bulmasını istediği eşit bir denge kurdu - işin, aile üyelerine bakmanın ve seçim özgürlüğünün hepsinin kendi yerine sahip olduğu basit, mutlu bir hayat.<br/><br/>ABD'de Mülteci Kadınlara Destek<br/><br/>Bu Anneler Günü hikayesini sevdiklerinizle paylaşın.

| The Precedency Essay<br/><br/>1562 words - 7 pages<br/><br/>Affirmative action is a government policy that gives opportunities to minorities, women, and any group who has been the victim of discrimination in the past. Affirmative action is the outcome of the 1960's Civil Rights movement, growing out of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 which outlawed discrimination based on race, ethnicity, or gender. It was the 1978 Supreme Court decision, The Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, which allowed for the use of race-based preferences as a means of fostering diversity, allowing affirmative action to be used in admissions policies. It was created with the intention to provide equal opportunities for members of minority groups in education and ...view middle of the document...<br/><br/>However, according to a 2007 report by the Pew Research Center, support for affirmative action among the American public has actually increased substantiallyin recent years, climbing from 58% in 1995 to 70% in 2007. Supporters of affirmative action make many arguments in support of affirmative action, in the hopes of getting others to see the genuine good that affirmative actin policies bring to our society. Supporters believe that affirmative action is more of a process rather than an admissions policy. Colleges and universities take the extra initiative to reach out to minority groups, encouraging them to apply. Colleges and universities offer additional financial aid and provide on-campus resources to help better the student's college education. Supporters also note the rising number of minority applications to colleges and universities due in part to affirmative action policies.<br/>Statistics have proven that when affirmative action is eliminated, such as when it was at Berkley College and UCLA in 1998, the minority student admissions fell 61 percent and 36 percent respectively, proving that affirmative action plays a major role in a minority students college admissions process. Affirmative action supporters also believe that diversity in higher education provides a better educational atmosphere for all students, personally and intellectually. If affirmative action were to be eliminated, there would be fewer minority students enrolled in colleges, causing diversity to be fairly slim. Affirmative action policies are also necessary in order to compensate for centuries of racial, economic, and social oppression. Individuals with a higher socioeconomic status have more opportunities than those of lower socioeconomic backgrounds. Supporters believe that certain racial or ethnic groups are disadvantaged because they are frequently in lower income households and consequently are not exposed to the same resources as students from higher socioeconomic classes. Advocates support the notion of competition between students based on merit, but argue that affirmative action compensates for economic differences. College graduates, who have benefitted from affirmative action, have also said that they received better jobs, earned more money, and overall live better lives because of the fortunate opportunities they received through affirmative action.<br/>Supporters of affirmative action continuously stress the severe importance of affirmative action, considering its contributions to enhancing both the college experience and society in general. However, opponents of affirmative action believe that the time has come to end affirmative action. Opponents believe affirmative action was created to ensure fair admission practices to bring change to a long period of racial discrimination. They believe the policy is outdated."It's time to pull the plug on race-based decision making," says Ward Connerly, a Sacramento, California businessman and lead organizer of...<br/><br/>Find Another Essay On The Precedency<br/><br/>754 words - 4 pages<br/>of the burden to continue prospering.

Olumlu eylemi destekleyenler, olumlu eylem politikalarının toplumumuza getirdiği gerçek iyiliği başkalarının görmesini sağlamak umuduyla olumlu eylemi desteklemek için birçok argümanda bulunurlar. Destekçiler, olumlu eylemin kabul politikasından ziyade bir süreç olduğuna inanıyor. Kolejler ve üniversiteler, azınlık gruplarına ulaşmak için ekstra inisiyatif alarak onları başvurmaya teşvik ediyor. Kolejler ve üniversiteler ek mali yardım sunar ve öğrencinin kolej eğitimini iyileştirmeye yardımcı olmak için kampüs içi kaynaklar sağlar. Destekçiler, kısmen olumlu eylem politikaları nedeniyle kolejlere ve üniversitelere giderek artan azınlık başvuru sayısına da dikkat çekiyor.<br/>İstatistikler, 1998'de Berkley Koleji ve UCLA'da olduğu gibi olumlu eylem ortadan kalktığında, azınlık öğrenci kabullerinin sırasıyla yüzde 61 ve yüzde 36 düştüğü, olumlu eylemin azınlık öğrencileri kolej kabul sürecinde büyük bir rol oynadığını kanıtlamıştır. Olumlu eylem destekçileri, yüksek öğretimdeki çeşitliliğin tüm öğrenciler için kişisel ve entelektüel olarak daha iyi bir eğitim ortamı sağladığına da inanmaktadır. Olumlu eylem ortadan kaldırılacak olsaydı, üniversitelere kayıtlı azınlık öğrencileri daha az olurdu ve bu da çeşitliliğin oldukça zayıf olmasına neden olurdu. Yüzyıllarca süren ırksal, ekonomik ve sosyal baskıyı telafi etmek için olumlu eylem politikaları da gereklidir. Daha yüksek sosyoekonomik statüye sahip bireyler, daha düşük sosyoekonomik geçmişlere sahip olanlardan daha fazla fırsata sahiptir. Destekçiler, belirli ırksal veya etnik grupların dezavantajlı olduğunu, çünkü genellikle daha düşük gelirli hanelerde olduklarını ve sonuç olarak daha yüksek sosyoekonomik sınıflardan gelen öğrencilerle aynı kaynaklara maruz kalmadıklarını düşünüyor. Avukatlar, öğrenciler arasındaki rekabet kavramını liyakata dayalı olarak destekler, ancak olumlu eylemin ekonomik farklılıkları telafi ettiğini savunur. Olumlu eylemden yararlanan üniversite mezunları, olumlu eylem yoluyla elde ettikleri şanslı fırsatlar nedeniyle daha iyi işler aldıklarını, daha fazla para kazandıklarını ve genel olarak daha iyi hayatlar yaşadıklarını da söylediler.<br/>Olumlu eylemin destekçileri, hem üniversite deneyimini hem de genel olarak toplumu geliştirmeye olan katkılarını göz önünde bulundurarak, olumlu eylemin ciddi önemini sürekli olarak vurgulamaktadır. Bununla birlikte, olumlu eylem karşıtları, olumlu eylemi sona erdirmenin zamanının geldiğine inanıyor. Muhalifler, uzun bir ırk ayrımcılığı dönemine değişiklik getirmek için adil kabul uygulamalarını sağlamak için olumlu eylem yaratıldığına inanıyor. Politikanın modası geçmiş olduğuna inanıyorlar."

| Combinations<br/><br/>Combinations Are defenses against a punch, choreographed responses to different types of attacks. They have many names across the martial arts but (in my experience) every art has a version of them. This makes them different than forms because there are plenty of martial arts that have no forms. What makes there partner exercises so universal? Why practice a specific response when (in reality) timing, type of attack, size of the attacker, and a hundred other factors will make it so you never use that entire choreographed response? And finally, how can we practice for a real defense situation and avoid injury at the same time?<br/><br/>The universality of combinations is impressive, to say the least. Our style of Kenpo karate has a list of 108 combos that can be learned. (Most students only learn 20-30 though) In Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu you spend whole classes practicing arm bars and chokes, learning every subtlety to the move while your partner offers little to no resistance. Every boxer has spent hours in front of the bag and/or mirror throwing the same combination of punches until their body moves by reflex alone. Combinations are universal because we have no better way to introduce movement and then practice the subtle positions required to make them work. Hitting a small pressure point through clothing takes A LOT of practice, catching an arm bar with control requires a carefully placed hip and a sneaky setup, and a great combination is only useful if you can through it from a balanced and protected position. Can you think of a better way to gain these skills?<br/><br/>There is any number of factors that determine how you respond to an attack and whether in a sparring match or in a fight, I have NEVER used a full combination in my defense. Why, then, do we spend hours practicing them? We practice these choreographed responses because the objective is not to pull combination 8 out every time you see a hook punch but to show you one way of blocking it and then a possible way to follow it up. I have never chosen to use combination 3 in a reality situation but the block is one of my go-to moves. Combinations add tools to the toolbox they do not fix the car.<br/><br/>The last question is a question of safety. If we practice for the sake of reality we need to replicate reality. How do we prevent injury while doing so? When it comes down to it, it's about building trust. We start slow and learn to trust that we have control over ourselves. We learn to trust our partners have control as well. In more time we learn to trust our control over our partner and (a little scarier) we learn to trust our partner's control over us. In the end (with a lot of practice) you can move are full speed, tossing your partner, and being thrown without fear of injury.<br/><br/>Combinations are universal for a reason; they are practiced so they can be dissected into their parts, and we stay safe by starting slow and building trust. As with everything else in the martial arts, combinations have many reasons behind their practice and execution. | Kombinasyonlar<br/><br/>Kombinasyonlar Bir yumruk karşı savunmalar, farklı saldırı türlerine koreografili yanıtlar. Dövüş sanatları boyunca birçok isimleri var ama (benim deneyimlerime göre) her sanat bunların bir versiyonuna sahiptir. Bu onları formlardan farklı kılar, çünkü formları olmayan çok sayıda dövüş sanatı vardır. Orada ortak alıştırmaları bu kadar evrensel kılan nedir? Neden (gerçekte) zamanlama, saldırı türü, saldırganın boyutu ve yüz diğer faktör bunu yapacak, böylece koreografideki tüm yanıtı asla kullanmayacaksınız? Ve son olarak, gerçek bir savunma durumu için nasıl pratik yapabiliriz ve aynı zamanda yaralanmadan nasıl kaçınabiliriz?<br/><br/>Kombinasyonların evrenselliği, en azından söylemek gerekirse, etkileyicidir. Kenpo karate tarzımız, öğrenilebilecek 108 kombonun bir listesine sahiptir. (Çoğu öğrenci sadece 20-30 öğrenir) Brezilya Jiu-Jitsu'da, tüm sınıfları kol çubukları ve boğmacaları pratik ederek geçirirsiniz, eşiniz hiç direnç göstermeden çok az şey sunarken, harekete yönelik her inceliği öğrenirsiniz. Her boksör, vücutları tek başına refleksle hareket edene kadar aynı yumruk kombinasyonunu fırlatan torbanın ve / veya aynanın önünde saatler geçirdi. Kombinasyonlar evrenseldir, çünkü hareketi tanıtmak ve daha sonra onları çalıştırmak için gereken ince pozisyonları uygulamak için daha iyi bir yolumuz yoktur. Giysiler aracılığıyla küçük bir basınç noktasına vurmak çok fazla pratik gerektirir, kol çubuğunu kontrol ile yakalamak, dikkatlice yerleştirilmiş bir kalça ve sinsi bir kurulum gerektirir ve büyük bir kombinasyon, yalnızca dengeli ve korumalı bir konumdan geçebiliyorsanız yararlıdır. Bu becerileri kazanmak için daha iyi bir yol düşünebiliyor musunuz?<br/><br/>Bir saldırıya nasıl tepki verdiğinizi belirleyen ve bir maç veya kavgada, savunmamda ASLA tam bir kombinasyon kullanmadım. Neden, o zaman, bunları pratik yapmak için saatler harcıyoruz? Bu koreografili yanıtları uyguluyoruz çünkü amaç, bir kanca yumruğu gördüğünüz her seferinde 8 kombinasyonunu çıkarmak değil, bunu engellemenin bir yolunu ve ardından takip etmenin olası bir yolunu göstermektir. Hiçbir zaman gerçek bir durumda kombinasyon 3 kullanmayı seçmedim, ancak blok benim go-to hareketlerimden biridir. Kombinasyonlar aracı tamir etmedikleri araç kutusuna araçlar ekler.<br/><br/>Son soru bir güvenlik sorunudur. Gerçeklik uğruna pratik yaparsak gerçekliği çoğaltmamız gerekir. Bunu yaparken yaralanmayı nasıl önleyebiliriz? Konuya gelince, güven inşa etmekle ilgilidir. Yavaş başlar ve kendimiz üzerinde kontrol sahibi olduğumuza güvenmeyi öğreniriz. Ortaklarımızın da kontrol sahibi olduğuna güvenmeyi öğreniriz. Daha fazla zaman içinde ortağımız üzerindeki kontrolümüze güvenmeyi öğreniriz ve (biraz daha korkutucu) ortağımızın bizim üzerimizdeki kontrolüne güvenmeyi öğreniriz. Sonunda (birçok uygulama ile) hareket edebilirsiniz tam hız, ortağınızı atmak ve yaralanma korkusu olmadan atılmak.<br/><br/>Kombinasyonlar bir nedenle evrenseldir; parçalarına ayrıştırılabilmeleri için uygulanırlar ve yavaş başlayıp güven inşa ederek güvende kalırız. Dövüş sanatlarındaki diğer her şeyde olduğu gibi, kombinasyonların da pratiklerinin ve icralarının arkasında birçok neden vardır. |
