In simple terms, the condition is characterized by: one develops a kidney disease and undergoes a kidney transplant and other diseases associated with acidic concentration in the blood and gout. In theory, the condition will occur even if the genetic change is inherited from one parent and sporadically occurs when there is no family history.<br/><br/>Common names of autosomal dominant interstitial kidney disease<br/><br/>The condition has other names as well namely: medullary cystic kidney disease, although this name is not used as much because most people suffering from this condition do not have medullary cysts. It is also referred to as juvenile hyperuricemic nephropathy. The disease tends to affect people of ages 20 to 50. The latter condition as aforementioned occurs in young children, something, which translate to get it from both parents.<br/>Cystic kidney disease is an inherited condition whereby the cysts in the centre of each kidney gradually lose their ability to function properly. Cysts refer to abnormal blisters of fluid in the kidney. The condition further scares the kidney making unable to concentrate the urine and as a result, producing too much urine. Its symptoms include excessive urination, salt cravings, weakness, confusion, bleeding, fatigue, frequent hiccups, low blood pressure, nausea and vomiting, headaches, pale skin, reduced sensation in the hands, weight loss among many others. Other complications include: anemia, ulcers, loss of bone density, infertility and other heart related problems.<br/>Its analysis incorporates blood tests to check for sodium levels and general kidney functions, urine tests to check the levels of concentration and other imbalances, x rays to check for the size of kidneys that may be altered owing to increased urine concentrations, renal biopsy and genetic testing to verify any genetic changes that might have taken place in due time.<br/>While the disease does not have a cut and dry treatment to it, one may focus on controlling measures, which include intake of fluids and salt to supplement the one lost as the disease progresses into latter stages. This also helps reduce dehydration. Other treatments include taking of prescribed medication and diet changes and minimal intakes of foods containing phosphorous and potassium. Further complications may also require one to have a kidney transplant. Basically, this is not a curable disease but rather a manageable once detected in the early stages.<br/><br/>The common yet different factor of Autosomal dominant interstitial kidney disease<br/><br/>Nephronophthisis and medullary cystic kidney disease are mainly grouped together because, in essence, they share the same features but with a slight difference in regards inheritance patterns to the former affecting children and the latter affecting young adults and older age groups. Similar features for both are ADH resistant urine concentration that leads to polyuria and polydipsia, anemia and renal diseases.<br/>The former aforementioned condition is Autosomal recessive accounting to 15% of chronic diseases and causes ESRD during early childhood while the latter is Autosomal dominant with a few sporadic new mutations and causes ESRD for people between the ages of 30 and 50. | Online CPR Sertifikasyon Blogu<br/><br/>Tarih: 23 Temmuz 2014<br/><br/>Otozomal dominant interstisyel böbrek hastalığı, böbreğin bilinen işlevlerini etkileyen nadir bir hastalık koleksiyonudur.

| Hobbes' vs. Locke's Account on the State of Nature<br/><br/>Topic: PhilosophyWords: 2539Pages: 9Aug 3rd, 2021<br/><br/>Hobbes and Locke are among the most influential political philosophers to ever write in English. The state of nature, which precedes the organization of the complex societies, is the common premise that both Hobbes and Locke share but interpret in different ways. The former views humans in their natural state as equally dangerous and free to pursue their egoistic goals unrestricted by the nonexistent notions of justice, which is why his natural state amounts to the "war of every man against every man" (Hobbes76). The latter, on the other hand, views humans in their original condition as equally valuable and restricts natural freedom by the idea of justice that requires not to harm others, which allows defining the state of nature as "mutual assistance and preservation" rather than war (Locke 15). The key difference between the two philosophers' accounts of natural state is that Locke uses ethical considerations while Hobbes does not, and it ultimately leads Hobbes to envisage a state exercising unlimited power over human beings, while Locke limits the government by the moral principles, which he considers a natural law.<br/><br/>Hobbes bases his assumptions regarding the state of nature on the fact that all people are roughly equal in their physical and mental capabilities. He admits that some individuals may demonstrate greater physical strength or superior intellect but insists that "when all is reckoned together, the difference between man and man is not so considerable" (Hobbes 74). Since humans are roughly equal in their capabilities, they also have similar hopes to attain their ends and satisfy their needs (Hobbes 75). As a logical outcome of this equality, when the people begin competing for scarce resources, no one may feel entirely secure in his or her possessions. Even if a mighty, cunning, and capable person succeeds in subjugating "the persons of all men he can," it still does not guarantee the ultimate security (Hobbes 75). As no human can obtain such superiority over the others that renders him or her utterly immune to their strength of intellect, no human can feel completely safe when surrounded by his or her equals. Hobbes' equality in the natural state is equality of fear, where all humans view each other as dangerous competitors.<br/><br/>Just as Hobbes, Locke considers all human beings to be fundamentally equal, but assigns a very different meaning to the term. From his perspective, it is not the equality of capabilities, but, rather, the equality of value. He opines that the people "promiscuously born to all the same advantages of nature" should logically enjoy the perfect equality among them, as there is no reason to consider anyone inherently more valuable (Locke 8). The only possible foundation for designating some people as superior to others would be if God "by any manifest declaration of his will, set one above another" (Locke 8). Since such divine sanction of superiority is absent, Locke concludes that the natural equality of all representatives of humankind is not to be called into question. Hobbes approaches equality pragmatically and stresses that people in their natural state are equally dangerous, but Locke employs an ethical approach and emphasizes that humans are equally valuable in God's eyes. This disagreement is but the first difference between the two authors based on the fact that Locke includes God as a premise into his political philosophy, while Hobbes does not.<br/><br/>Another characteristic feature of Hobbes' account of the natural state is his interpretation of liberty. According to Hobbes, the state of nature implies unlimited freedom to do whatever is necessary for one's continued existence. The philosopher defines liberty as "the absence of external impediments" in using one's abilities to attain one's goals (Hobbes 79). The primary purpose of every sentient being is to maintain its continued existence. As a consequence, Hobbesian freedom amounts to the unhindered opportunity to do anything that, in one's judgment, would be best suited to preserve one's life and possessions (Hobbes 79). The only limitation to liberty is that a person cannot do anything contradictory to sustaining his or her life or destroying "the means of preserving the same" (Hobbes 79). Apart from that, there are no boundaries, and everyone has "a right to everything, even to one another's body" if that furthers one's survival (Hobbes 80). Thus, natural liberty, as viewed by Hobbes, is the absence of externally enforced obstacles in pursuing one's right to everything to sustain and secure one's continued existence.<br/><br/>Locke also upholds the idea of natural liberty but, unsurprisingly, approaches it in a manner that is significantly different from that of Hobbes. As soon as he begins discussing liberty in the state of nature, he immediately notes that a state of freedom does not equate "a state of license" (Locke 9). The philosopher identifies two specific limitations to human freedom in the state of nature. The first one is identical to that introduce by Hobbes: however free and independent, a person nevertheless "has not liberty to destroy himself" (Locke 9). Yet the second limitation contradicts Hobbes' prepositions directly. According to Locke, every human being has a natural obligation not to "harm another in his life, health, liberty, or possessions" (9). Just as with his interpretation of equality, the author bases this assertion on ethical and religious grounds: people should preserve each other's existence since they are all creations of the same "omnipotent, and infinitely wise maker" (Locke 9). Thus, Locke's limits liberty in the natural state far more stringently than Hobbes by introducing the obligation to refrain from harming both oneself and the others.<br/><br/>The differences between the two authors also manifest in their accounts of justice in the natural state of humanity. As far as Hobbes is concerned, delineating just and unjust practices is merely the matter of the law. There is no jurisprudence in the state of nature, and the only law governing human beings in their original condition is a natural law that only obliges them to seek personal security. As a result, nothing can be unjust in the original state of the humankind: "notions of right and wrong justice and injustice" have no place and no meaning in the absence of the stringently enforced law (Hobbes 78). As long as the people use their virtually unlimited freedom to ruthlessly compete with each other for resources, to which they are equally entitled, they have no criteria to differentiate between just and unjust actions. Therefore, the Hobbesian state of nature defies the very idea of justice since the author interprets it as a mere function of the formalized and established law.<br/><br/>Locke assigns different meaning to justice and views it not so much in legislative as in the ethical terms. This paper already mentioned that, unlike Hobbes, Locke employs ethical notions and generally bases his political philosophy on moral rather than purely practical presumptions. Locke's natural law, unlike that of Hobbes, obliges human beings to take care of each other rather than simply leaving everyone to fend for themselves. As a result, there is a place for justice and injustice in his state of nature. The author points to this fact himself when noting that no one should deprive another of his or her life of the means of preserving it "unless it be to do justice on an offender" (Locke 9). This statement reveals with the utmost clarity that, according to Locke, there is justice in the state of nature, and, moreover, humans have to preserve it actively. The criterion of justice, which Hobbes' natural state lacks, is the second limitation on natural liberty imposed by Locke: an action is unjust if it constitutes an unwarranted threat to another person's life and possessions.<br/><br/>These differences in the two authors' treatment of equality, liberty, and justice or injustice culminate in their interpretation of the relationship between the state of nature and the state of war. From Hobbes's perspective, the two are synonymous, because the ruthless competition is the only logical outcome of putting people with equivalent capabilities and similar needs in an environment with limited resources. He states this connection outright: "if any two men desire the same thing, which nevertheless they cannot both enjoy, they become enemies" and are, therefore, in the state of war with each other (Hobbes 75). Yet since humans are numerous and all possess similar capabilities and needs, this competition manifests not only in the individual interactions but also on the level of humanity as a whole. As long as all humans have equal and unlimited rights to all resources and even to each other's bodies and lives, the state of nature is a war of "every man against every man" (Hobbes 76). This grim interpretation stems directly from Hobbes' portrayal of the state of nature as governed solely by the individuals' egoistic urges.<br/><br/>Locke, on the other hand, differentiates between the state of nature and the state of war and points out that, while they may occur simultaneously, it is no reason to identify one with the other. Locke's definition of the state of war is virtually identical to that offered by Hobbes. According to Locke, "he who attempts to get another man into his absolute power does thereby put himself into a state of war with him" (14). This explanation lines up perfectly with the Hobbesian notion that everyone's universal right to everything, including the other people's bodies and lives, leads to the state of war. Yet Locke refuses to equate the state of war and the state of nature precisely because he denies Hobbes' interpretation of natural freedom. Since Locke's natural state restrains people from harming each other through the second limitation of liberty, an attempt on another person's freedom is a transgression against the natural law. While for Hobbes, war is the humankind's condition by default, Locke portrays it as a perversion of the state of nature rather than its rule.<br/><br/>These differences in delineating the state on nature and its constituents, such as liberty, equality, justice, and war, pave the way to the authors contrasting portrayals of government. Based on his pessimistic assessment of the state of nature, the author of Leviathan concludes that, under conditions of war, there can be no definite hope for "living out the time which nature ordinarily alloweth men to live" (Hobbes 80). The solution is laying down the universal right to everything and leaving everyone "so much liberty against other men, as he would allow other men against himself" (Hobbes 80). The participants of the resulting social contract invest the unlimited liberties they have surrendered into a sovereign – the bearer of the supreme power whose purpose is to preserve the achieved status quo by punishing all transgressions against it. Sovereign's power is absolute: the ruler has the authority "to do whatsoever he shall think necessary" to promote peace between his subjects so that no one would assail another's life or property (113). Hobbes concludes that without such an unassailable figure entitled with the right to do anything to the subjects, there can be no peace and no guarantee of security.<br/><br/>While Locke agrees with the necessity of creating politically organized societies, he nevertheless opposes Hobbes' idea of the sovereign power as unlimited and unassailable. As mentioned above, Locke's state of nature is not nearly as dreadful as that painted by Hobbes because of the people's obligation to preserve not only themselves but each other as well. Therefore, the need for social contract arises not from the fear of the others, but from the sheer convenience. Small communities may not need numerous laws to solve conflicts and "officers to superintend the process," but larger associations find it advisable to institute governments for that purpose (Locke 57). Yet the power of the government cannot be unlimited because it would result in subduing the subjects to an "inconstant, uncertain, unknown, arbitrary will of another man" (Locke 17). Such a government would constitute a twofold violation of the natural law. By agreeing to another person's absolute power over his life, a subject would violate its first limitation prohibiting to harm oneself. As for the ruler, destroying another person's liberty would constitute direct harm and, as such, be contradictory to the second limitation.<br/><br/>As a direct continuation of his case for unlimited governmental authority, Hobbes denies the separation of powers as a principle. From his perspective, the sovereign, once instituted, possesses "the whole power of prescribing the rules" governing the lives of the subjects or, in shorter terms, the legislative power (Hobbes 114). The sovereign also reserves the right of "hearing and deciding all controversies" – that is, the judicial power (Hobbes 114). Finally, since the entire purpose of the sovereign is to force the subjects to refrain from harming each other, there can be no doubt that executive power is also his or her exclusive prerogative. The separation of powers as a concept is alien to Hobbes because of his views on the state of nature. Creating a political entity where the executive, legislative, and judicial branches would check each other – that is, compete – would mean recreating the Hobbesian state of nature-as-war on a higher level. Since the people enter a social contract and institute a government to put the state of nature behind them, not reinstate it in a different form, the separation of powers contradictory Hobbes' views directly.<br/><br/>Locke, on the other hand, embraces separation of power as a foundational principle of his political theory. His case for the separation is evident in the discussion of the limits of the legislative power. As Locke puts it, it would be hardly advisable "for the same persons, who have the power of making laws, to have also in their hands the power to execute them" (76). The philosopher points to the imperfections of human nature and the inherent desire to "grasp at power" as a rationale for this precautionary measure (Locke 76). Just as in Hobbes' case, Locke's account of the separation of powers stems directly from his interpretation of the state of nature. If there is already justice in the state of nature and the people can understand it, any government is inevitably subject to the same natural law. Since absolute power over people violates both limitations of this law, separating and distributing it is advisable so that the government would function appropriately.<br/><br/>This paper has demonstrated that, while the differences between Hobbes' and Locke's accounts of the natural state of humanity are numerous, they ultimately amount to the presence of absence of moral premises. Hobbes views the natural state as that of unlimited liberty, where people endowed with equal capabilities and not bound by any moral notions, such as justice, compete for the resources unceasingly. Locke, however, interprets equality and liberty ethically rather than practically and opines that war is a perversion of the natural state, as the natural law obliges humans not to harm each other. This disagreement influences the philosophers' approaches to government. Hobbes insists on an all-powerful ruler, as, in the absence of ethical restraints, no other authority could force the humans to refrain from harming each other. Yet, in Locke's view, granting the government unlimited powers would be contradictory to the ethical limitations embedded in the law of nature, which is why he, unlike Hobbes, advocates separation of powers. | Hobbes'un Locke'a Karşı Doğanın Durumu Hakkındaki Hesabı<br/><br/>Konu: FelsefeKelimeler: 2539Sayfalar: 9Aug 3rd, 2021<br/><br/>Hobbes ve Locke, İngilizce yazan en etkili politik filozoflar arasındadır. Karmaşık toplumların örgütlenmesinden önce gelen doğa durumu, hem Hobbes'un hem de Locke'un paylaştığı ancak farklı şekillerde yorumladığı ortak önermedir. İlki, insanları doğal hallerinde, var olmayan adalet kavramlarıyla kısıtlanmış egoist hedeflerini takip etmekte eşit derecede tehlikeli ve özgür olarak görür; bu nedenle doğal durumu, "her insanın her insana karşı savaşı" anlamına gelir (Hobbes76). Öte yandan, ikincisi, insanları orijinal durumlarında eşit derecede değerli olarak görür ve doğal özgürlüğü, başkalarına zarar vermemeyi gerektiren adalet fikriyle kısıtlar, bu da doğanın durumunu savaştan ziyade "karşılıklı yardım ve koruma" olarak tanımlamayı sağlar (Locke 15). İki filozofun doğal durumla ilgili anlatımları arasındaki temel fark, Locke'un Hobbes'un kullanmadığı etik düşünceleri kullanmasıdır ve sonuçta Hobbes'un insanlar üzerinde sınırsız güç kullanan bir devlet hayal etmesine yol açarken, Locke hükümeti doğal bir yasa olarak gördüğü ahlaki ilkelerle sınırlar.<br/><br/>Hobbes, doğa durumuyla ilgili varsayımlarını, tüm insanların fiziksel ve zihinsel yeteneklerinde kabaca eşit olduğu gerçeğine dayandırır. Bazı bireylerin daha büyük fiziksel güç veya üstün zeka gösterebileceğini kabul eder, ancak "her şey birlikte hesaplandığında, insan ile insan arasındaki farkın o kadar da önemli olmadığını" ısrar eder (Hobbes 74). İnsanlar yeteneklerinde kabaca eşit oldukları için, aynı zamanda hedeflerine ulaşmak ve ihtiyaçlarını karşılamak için benzer umutlara sahiptirler (Hobbes 75). Bu eşitliğin mantıklı bir sonucu olarak, insanlar kıt kaynaklar için rekabet etmeye başladıklarında, hiç kimse mal varlığında tamamen güvende hissetmeyebilir. Kudretli, kurnaz ve yetenekli bir kişi, "yapabileceği tüm insanların kişilerini" boyunduruk altına almayı başarsa bile, yine de nihai güvenliği garanti etmez (Hobbes 75). Hiçbir insan, kendisini ya da kendisini zeka güçlerine karşı tamamen bağışık hale getiren diğerlerine karşı böyle bir üstünlük sağlayamadığı için, hiçbir insan kendi eşitleriyle çevriliyken kendini tamamen güvende hissedemez. Hobbes'un doğal durumdaki eşitliği, tüm insanların birbirlerini tehlikeli rakipler olarak gördüğü korku eşitliğidir.<br/><br/>Tıpkı Hobbes gibi, Locke da tüm insanları temelde eşit görür, ancak terime çok farklı bir anlam yükler. Onun bakış açısına göre, bu yeteneklerin eşitliği değil, daha ziyade değer eşitliğidir. O, insanların "doğanın tüm aynı avantajlarına rasgele doğduğunu", doğal olarak daha değerli birini dikkate almak için hiçbir neden olmadığı için, mantıksal olarak aralarında mükemmel eşitliğin tadını çıkarmaları gerektiğini söyler (Locke 8). Bazı insanları diğerlerinden daha üstün olarak belirlemenin tek olası temeli, Tanrı'nın "isteğinin herhangi bir açık beyanıyla, birbirinin üzerine koyması" olurdu (Locke 8). Bu kadar ilahi üstünlük yaptırımı bulunmadığından Locke, insanlığın tüm temsilcilerinin doğal eşitliğinin sorgulanmaması gerektiği sonucuna varır. Hobbes, eşitliğe pragmatik bir şekilde yaklaşır ve doğal hallerindeki insanların eşit derecede tehlikeli olduğunu vurgular, ancak Locke etik bir yaklaşım uygular ve insanların Tanrı'nın gözünde eşit derecede değerli olduğunu vurgular. Bu anlaşmazlık, iki yazar arasındaki, Locke'un Tanrı'yı politik felsefesine bir öncül olarak dahil ettiği gerçeğine dayanan ilk farktan başka bir şey değildir, oysa Hobbes etmez.<br/><br/>Hobbes'un doğal durumla ilgili anlatımının bir başka karakteristik özelliği de özgürlük yorumudur. Hobbes'a göre, doğanın durumu, kişinin sürekli varlığı için gerekli olan her şeyi yapmak için sınırsız özgürlük anlamına gelir. Filozof, özgürlüğü, kişinin hedeflerine ulaşmak için yeteneklerini kullanmasında "dış engellerin yokluğu" olarak tanımlar (Hobbes 79). Her duyarlı varlığın birincil amacı, varlığını sürdürmektir. Sonuç olarak, Hobbes'un özgürlüğü, kişinin hayatını ve malını korumak için en uygun olan her şeyi yapmak için engelsiz bir fırsat anlamına gelir (Hobbes 79). Özgürlüğün tek kısıtlaması, bir insanın kendi hayatını sürdürmek veya "aynı şeyi koruma araçlarını" yok etmek için çelişkili bir şey yapamayacağıdır (Hobbes 79). Bunun dışında sınır yoktur ve eğer bu kişinin hayatta kalmasını sağlarsa herkesin "her şeye, hatta birbirlerinin bedenine bile hakkı vardır" (Hobbes 80). Bu nedenle, Hobbes'un gördüğü gibi, doğal özgürlük, kişinin varlığını sürdürmek ve güvence altına almak için her şeye hakkının peşinden koşarken dışsal olarak uygulanan engellerin yokluğudur.<br/><br/>Locke aynı zamanda doğal özgürlük fikrini de savunuyor, ancak şaşırtıcı olmayan bir şekilde Hobbes'unkinden önemli ölçüde farklı bir şekilde ona yaklaşıyor. Doğa durumunda özgürlüğü tartışmaya başlar başlamaz, hemen bir özgürlük durumunun "bir lisans durumunu" eşitlemediğini not eder (Locke 9). Filozof, doğa durumunda insan özgürlüğüne iki özel sınırlama tanımlar. İlki Hobbes'un bu tanıtımıyla aynıdır: ne kadar özgür ve bağımsız olsa da, yine de bir kişi "kendini yok etme özgürlüğüne sahip değildir" (Locke 9). Locke'a göre, her insanın "hayatında, sağlığında, özgürlüğünde veya mülkünde bir başkasına zarar vermeme" doğal bir yükümlülüğü vardır. Tıpkı eşitlik yorumunda olduğu gibi, yazar bu iddiayı etik ve dini temellere dayandırır: insanlar birbirlerinin varlığını korumalıdır, çünkü hepsi aynı "omnipotent ve sonsuz bilge yapıcı"nın yaratımlarıdır (Locke 9). Böylece, Locke'un doğal haldeki özgürlüğü, Hobbes'tan çok daha sıkı bir şekilde, hem kendine hem de diğerlerine zarar vermekten kaçınma yükümlülüğünü getirerek sınırlar.<br/><br/>İki yazar arasındaki farklılıklar, insanlığın doğal durumundaki adalet hesaplarında da kendini gösterir. Hobbes'a göre, adil ve haksız uygulamaları betimlemek sadece yasanın konusudur. Doğanın durumunda hukuk yoktur ve insanları orijinal hallerinde yöneten tek yasa, onları yalnızca kişisel güvenlik aramaya zorlayan doğal bir yasadır. Sonuç olarak, insanlığın orijinal durumunda hiçbir şey haksız olamaz: "doğru ve yanlış adalet ve adaletsizliğin" katı bir şekilde uygulanan yasanın yokluğunda hiçbir yeri ve anlamı yoktur (Hobbes 78). İnsanlar, neredeyse sınırsız özgürlüklerini, eşit haklara sahip oldukları kaynaklar için birbirleriyle acımasızca rekabet etmek için kullandıkları sürece, adil ve haksız eylemler arasında ayrım yapmak için hiçbir kritere sahip değildirler. Bu nedenle, Hobbesçu doğa durumu, yazar onu biçimlendirilmiş ve yerleşik yasanın salt bir işlevi olarak yorumladığı için adalet fikrine meydan okur.<br/><br/>Locke adalete farklı bir anlam yükler ve bunu etik terimlerde olduğu kadar yasamada da görmez. Bu makale, Hobbes'un aksine, Locke'un etik kavramlar kullandığından ve genel olarak politik felsefesini tamamen pratik varsayımlardan ziyade ahlaki temellere dayandırdığından bahsetmiştir. Locke'un doğal yasası, Hobbes'un aksine, insanları, herkesi kendi başının çaresine bakmak için bırakmak yerine, birbirlerine bakmaya zorlar. Sonuç olarak, doğa durumunda adalet ve adaletsizlik için bir yer vardır. Yazar, hiç kimsenin "bir suçlu üzerinde adalet yapmak olmadıkça" onu koruma araçlarından bir başkasını mahrum bırakmaması gerektiğini belirtirken bu gerçeğe dikkat çeker (Locke 9). Bu açıklama, Locke'a göre, doğanın durumunda adalet olduğunu ve dahası, insanların onu aktif olarak korumaları gerektiğini en açık şekilde ortaya koymaktadır. Hobbes'un doğal devletinin eksik olduğu adalet kriteri, Locke tarafından dayatılan doğal özgürlükle ilgili ikinci sınırlamadır: Bir eylem, başka bir kişinin yaşamı ve mülkü için haksız bir tehdit oluşturuyorsa haksızdır.<br/><br/>İki yazarın eşitlik, özgürlük ve adalet ya da adaletsizlik muamelesindeki bu farklılıklar, doğa durumu ile savaş durumu arasındaki ilişkiyi yorumlamalarıyla sonuçlanır. Hobbes'un bakış açısından, ikisi eş anlamlıdır, çünkü acımasız rekabet, sınırlı kaynaklara sahip bir ortama eşdeğer yeteneklere ve benzer ihtiyaçlara sahip insanları koymanın tek mantıklı sonucudur. Bu bağlantıyı açıkça belirtir: "Her iki adam da aynı şeyi arzularsa, yine de ikisi de zevk alamazlar, düşman olurlar" ve bu nedenle, birbirleriyle savaş halindedirler (Hobbes 75). Yine de insanlar çok sayıda olduğundan ve hepsi benzer yeteneklere ve ihtiyaçlara sahip olduğundan, bu rekabet sadece bireysel etkileşimlerde değil, aynı zamanda bir bütün olarak insanlık düzeyinde de tezahür eder. Tüm insanlar tüm kaynaklara ve hatta birbirlerinin bedenlerine ve yaşamlarına eşit ve sınırsız haklara sahip oldukları sürece, doğanın durumu "herkese karşı her insan" savaşıdır (Hobbes 76). Bu acımasız yorum, Hobbes'un doğanın durumunu yalnızca bireylerin egoist dürtüleri tarafından yönetildiği gibi tasvir etmesinden kaynaklanmaktadır.<br/><br/>Öte yandan Locke, doğa durumu ile savaş durumu arasında ayrım yapar ve aynı anda meydana gelebilirken, birini diğeriyle özdeşleştirmenin bir sebep olmadığına dikkat çeker. Locke'un savaş durumu tanımı, Hobbes tarafından sunulanla hemen hemen aynıdır. Locke'a göre, "bir başkasını mutlak gücüne sokmaya çalışan, böylece kendisini onunla bir savaş durumuna sokar" (14). Bu açıklama, Hobbesçuların, diğer insanların bedenleri ve yaşamları da dahil olmak üzere herkesin her şeye evrensel hakkının savaş durumuna yol açtığı düşüncesiyle mükemmel bir şekilde örtüşmektedir. Yine de Locke, Hobbes'un doğal özgürlük yorumunu reddettiği için savaş durumunu ve doğa durumunu eşitlemeyi reddediyor. Locke'un doğal durumu, insanların ikinci özgürlük sınırlaması yoluyla birbirlerine zarar vermelerini engellediğinden, başka bir kişinin özgürlüğüne yönelik bir girişim, doğal yasaya karşı bir ihlaldir. Hobbes için savaş, insanlığın varsayılan olarak durumu olsa da Locke, onu kuralından ziyade doğa durumunun bir sapkınlığı olarak tasvir eder.<br/><br/>Devletin doğaya ve özgürlük, eşitlik, adalet ve savaş gibi seçmenlerine yönelik olarak tasvir edilmesindeki bu farklılıklar, hükümetin tasvirlerine karşıt yazarların önünü açar. Leviathan'ın yazarı, doğanın durumu hakkındaki karamsar değerlendirmesine dayanarak, savaş koşulları altında, "doğanın normalde insanların yaşamasına izin verdiği zamanı yaşamak" için kesin bir umudun olamayacağı sonucuna varır (Hobbes 80). Çözüm, her şeyin evrensel hakkını ortaya koymak ve herkesi "başka insanlara karşı o kadar özgürlük bırakıyor ki, diğer insanların kendisine karşı olmasına izin verecek" (Hobbes 80). Ortaya çıkan toplumsal sözleşmenin katılımcıları, teslim oldukları sınırsız özgürlükleri bir egemene yatırırlar - amacı, elde edilen statükoyu korumak olan yüce gücün taşıyıcısı, ona karşı tüm ihlalleri cezalandırarak. Egemenin gücü mutlaktır: hükümdar, hiç kimsenin bir başkasının hayatına veya mülküne saldırmaması için tebaası arasında barışı teşvik etmek için "gerekli olduğunu düşündüğü her şeyi yapma" yetkisine sahiptir (113). Hobbes, tebaaya herhangi bir şey yapma hakkı olan bu kadar sarsılmaz bir figür olmadan, barış ve güvenlik garantisi olamayacağı sonucuna varır.<br/><br/>Locke, siyasi olarak örgütlü toplumlar yaratma zorunluluğunu kabul ederken, yine de Hobbes'un egemen iktidar fikrine sınırsız ve sarsılmaz olarak karşı çıkıyor. Yukarıda belirtildiği gibi, Locke'un doğa durumu, Hobbes'un boyadığı kadar korkunç değildir, çünkü halkın sadece kendilerini değil, birbirlerini de koruma yükümlülüğü vardır. Bu nedenle, sosyal sözleşme ihtiyacı, diğerlerinin korkusundan değil, sadece kolaylıktan doğar. Küçük topluluklar çatışmaları çözmek için çok sayıda yasaya ve "işçilerin süreci denetlemesine" ihtiyaç duymayabilir, ancak daha büyük dernekler bu amaçla hükümetler kurmayı tavsiye eder (Locke 57). Yine de hükümetin gücü sınırsız olamaz, çünkü bu, "başka bir adamın değişmez, belirsiz, bilinmeyen, keyfi bir iradesine" boyun eğdirilmesiyle sonuçlanacaktır (Locke 17). Böyle bir hükümet, doğal yasanın iki katı ihlalini oluşturacaktır. Başka bir kişinin hayatı üzerindeki mutlak gücünü kabul ederek, bir özne kendine zarar vermeyi yasaklayan ilk sınırlamasını ihlal eder. Hükümdara gelince, başka bir kişinin özgürlüğünü yok etmek doğrudan zarar verecek ve bu nedenle ikinci sınırlamaya aykırı olacaktır.<br/><br/>Sınırsız devlet otoritesi için davasının doğrudan devamı olarak Hobbes, güçlerin bir ilke olarak ayrılmasını reddeder. Onun bakış açısından, egemen, bir kez kurulduktan sonra, öznelerin yaşamlarını ya da daha kısa bir ifadeyle yasama gücünü yöneten "kuralları yazmanın tüm gücüne" sahiptir (Hobbes 114). Egemen aynı zamanda "tüm tartışmaları duyma ve karar verme" hakkını da saklı tutar - yani yargı gücünü (Hobbes 114). Son olarak, egemenin tüm amacı, özneleri birbirlerine zarar vermekten kaçınmaya zorlamak olduğundan, yürütme gücünün aynı zamanda onun özel ayrıcalığı olduğundan şüphe edilemez. Güçlerin bir kavram olarak ayrılması, doğanın durumu hakkındaki görüşleri nedeniyle Hobbes'a yabancıdır. Yönetici, yasama ve yargı dallarının birbirlerini kontrol edecekleri bir siyasi varlık yaratmak, yani rekabet etmek, Hobbesian doğa devletini savaş olarak daha yüksek bir seviyede yeniden yaratmak anlamına gelecektir. İnsanlar sosyal bir sözleşmeye girdiklerinden ve doğa durumunu arkalarına almak için bir hükümet kurduklarından, onu farklı bir biçimde geri getirmediklerinden, güçlerin ayrılması Hobbes'un görüşlerini doğrudan çelişir.<br/><br/>Öte yandan Locke, siyasi teorisinin temel ilkesi olarak iktidarın ayrılığını benimser. Ayrılık davası, yasama gücünün sınırlarının tartışılmasında belirgindir. Locke'un belirttiği gibi, "yasa yapma gücüne sahip olan aynı kişiler için, onları idam etme gücüne de sahip olmak" pek zor olacaktır (76). Filozof, insan doğasının kusurlarına ve bu ihtiyati tedbirin bir gerekçesi olarak "güçte otlatma" arzusuna işaret eder (Locke 76). Tıpkı Hobbes'un durumunda olduğu gibi, Locke'un güçler ayrılığını açıklaması doğrudan doğa durumunu yorumlamasından kaynaklanmaktadır. Doğa durumunda zaten adalet varsa ve halk bunu anlayabilirse, herhangi bir hükümet kaçınılmaz olarak aynı doğal yasaya tabidir. İnsanlar üzerindeki mutlak güç, bu yasanın her iki kısıtlamasını da ihlal ettiğinden, hükümetin uygun şekilde işlemesi için ayırma ve dağıtma tavsiye edilir.<br/><br/>Bu makale, Hobbes'un ve Locke'un insanlığın doğal durumuyla ilgili hesapları arasındaki farklılıkların çok sayıda olmasına rağmen, sonuçta ahlaki öncüllerin yokluğuna denk geldiğini göstermiştir. Hobbes, doğal durumu, eşit yeteneklere sahip ve adalet gibi herhangi bir ahlaki nosyona bağlı olmayan insanların kesintisiz olarak kaynaklar için rekabet ettiği sınırsız özgürlük olarak görür. Bununla birlikte Locke, eşitliği ve özgürlüğü pratikten ziyade etik olarak yorumlar ve doğal yasanın insanları birbirine zarar vermemeye zorladığı gibi, savaşın doğal devletin bir sapkınlığı olduğunu öne sürer. Bu anlaşmazlık filozofların hükümete yaklaşımlarını etkiler. Hobbes, her şeye gücü yeten bir hükümdar üzerinde ısrar eder, çünkü etik kısıtlamaların yokluğunda, başka hiçbir otorite insanları birbirlerine zarar vermekten alıkoyamaz. Yine de, Locke'un görüşüne göre, hükümete sınırsız yetki verilmesi, doğa yasasına gömülü etik sınırlamalarla çelişecektir, bu yüzden Hobbes'un aksine, güçler ayrılığını savunmaktadır. |
| Fashion Police: What Game of Thrones threw up<br/><br/>Canadian-French singer Abbas Hasan put blinding effort to outshine all of humanity at Fashion Parade 2014. Nothing wrong with that, except safety is priority and the musician is a health hazard here.<br/><br/>We get he wants to be a star. Sadly, he didn't get the memo where they tell the desperate and the infamous that stardom is a metaphor. You don't have to look like one and literally set our sight ablaze. Also, the All Pakistan Aunty Association has officially lodged a complaint against him. The local market has run dry of fake crystals and sequined monstrosities. They have nothing to wear to their biweekly high teas and they claim he is to blame. Apparently, the outfit is inspired by Game of Thrones. Can he please stick to composing sad songs about his neighbour's dead dog instead of conceptualising outfits? Or maybe it's the trauma of losing the dog, whose death he is clearly not over as he is still wearing its carcass.<br/><br/>The charge sheet Outfit<br/><br/>No one can decide where the outfit begins and where Abbas ends. You stare in fascination, sinking into a deep abyss and wonder why he is wearing leather pants. Whose horse did he kill to steal the saddle draped across his shoulders? Was he in prison right before his red carpet appearance and forgot to take off the chains? How will he survive the synthetic leather and post-sequin rash that is bound to be lethal in such high dosage? Why am I still alive?<br/><br/>Idea<br/><br/>His inspiration was seemingly Game of Thrones, but he eventually ended up looking like he was thrown out of a Viking restaurant. Had he come across any of the characters from the show, he would've been slain in the first five seconds of the first episode.<br/><br/>The mental health or lack thereof: Someone get him to a counsellor ASAP! He seems to be under the assumption that wearing a dead dog means that the only friend he had in his life is still alive. Dear Abbas:<br/><br/>1. Denial is not a river in Egypt<br/><br/>2. Your tortured psyche is not helping your music, so get help<br/><br/>3. Try imaginary friends<br/><br/>Bail out!<br/><br/>All of us at the Fashion Police headquarters are severely traumatised. Abbas is someone we did not enjoy arresting. He is currently in custody and attempting revenge by putting on attires from other fantasy shows. He just glitter glued himself in order to look like Edward Cullen from Twilight. As a public service message and to prevent further nervous breakdowns, we gave him the following examples of men from the red carpet of the same event.<br/><br/>Zohaib Hassan<br/><br/>When in doubt, play it safe. The singer looks like your average uncle at a shaadi. A plain black suit with no accessories, even if it's a tad disproportionate, is workable. Zohaib's look is blended into everything and nothing, and when you don't have a fashion sense or the money to hire a stylist, this is okay. It does not carry the risk of cardiac arrest for fellow attendees at an event. Given Abbas' delicate mental condition, this look is what he should aim for. Always and forever.<br/><br/>Ali Zafar<br/><br/>One day, after decades of therapy, Abbas could aspire to wear attire like Ali Zafar's. The dapper summer look is done to near perfection. Ali came really close to looking like a maître d at a French restaurant with his white summer jacket with black lapels, but the shirt saves it, never mind the satin. His pants would have been ridiculous had they not been folded at the ankles. The shoes are what hipster chic happy endings are made of. | Moda Polisi: Hangi Taht Oyunu kustu<br/><br/>Kanadalı-Fransız şarkıcı Abbas Hasan, Fashion Parade 2014'te tüm insanlığı gölgede bırakmak için kör edici bir çaba sarf etti. Bununla ilgili hiçbir sorun yok, güvenlik öncelik ve müzisyen burada bir sağlık tehlikesi.<br/><br/>Bir yıldız olmak istediğini anlıyoruz. Ne yazık ki, çaresizlere ve şöhretin bir metafor olduğunu kötü şöhretlilere söyledikleri notu alamadı. Bir gibi görünmenize ve kelimenin tam anlamıyla görüşümüzü alevlendirmenize gerek yok. Ayrıca, Tüm Pakistan Teyze Derneği resmen ona karşı bir şikayette bulundu. Yerel pazar sahte kristallerden ve pullu canavarlıklardan kurudu. İki haftada bir yüksek çaylarına giyecekleri hiçbir şeyleri yok ve suçlu olduğunu iddia ediyorlar. Görünüşe göre kıyafet Game of Thrones'tan esinlenilmiş. Kıyafetleri kavramsallaştırmak yerine komşusunun ölü köpeği hakkında hüzünlü şarkılar bestelemeye devam edebilir mi? Ya da belki de köpeği kaybetmenin travmasıdır, ölümü hala leşini giydiği için belli ki bitmemiştir.<br/><br/>Şarj kağıdı Outfit<br/><br/>Kıyafetin nerede başladığına ve Abbas'ın nerede bittiğine kimse karar veremez. Büyüleyici bir şekilde bakarsınız, derin bir uçuruma batarsınız ve neden deri pantolon giydiğini merak edersiniz. Kimin atını omuzlarından sarkan eyeri çalmak için öldürdü? Kırmızı halı görünümünden hemen önce hapiste miydi ve zincirleri çıkarmayı mı unuttu? Böyle yüksek dozda ölümcül olması gereken sentetik deri ve post-sequin döküntüsünden nasıl kurtulacak? Neden hala hayattayım?<br/><br/>Fikir<br/><br/>İlhamı görünüşte Game of Thrones'du, ancak sonunda bir Viking restoranından atılmış gibi görünüyordu. Dizideki karakterlerden herhangi birine rastlasaydı, ilk bölümün ilk beş saniyesinde öldürülmüş olurdu.<br/><br/>Ruh sağlığı ya da eksikliği: Birisi onu hemen bir danışmana götürsün! Ölü bir köpek takmanın hayatında sahip olduğu tek arkadaşın hala hayatta olduğu anlamına geldiği varsayımı altında görünüyor. Sevgili Abbas:<br/><br/>1. İnkar, Mısır'da bir nehir değildir<br/><br/>2. İşkence gören ruhunuz müziğinize yardımcı olmuyor, bu yüzden yardım alın<br/><br/>3. Hayali arkadaşları deneyin<br/><br/>Kefalet verin!<br/><br/>Fashion Police karargahındaki hepimiz ağır travma geçiriyoruz. Abbas tutuklanmaktan hoşlanmadığımız biri. Şu anda gözaltında ve diğer fantezi şovlarından kıyafetler giyerek intikam almaya çalışıyor. Sadece Twilight'tan Edward Cullen'a benzemek için kendini yapıştırdı. Bir kamu hizmeti mesajı olarak ve daha fazla sinir bozukluğunu önlemek için, ona aynı olayın kırmızı halısından aşağıdaki örnekleri verdik.<br/><br/>Zohaib Hassan<br/><br/>Şüpheniz olduğunda, güvenli çalın. Şarkıcı bir shaadi'deki ortalama amcanıza benziyor. Biraz orantısız olsa bile, aksesuarları olmayan sade bir siyah takım elbise işe yarayabilir. Zohaib'in görünüşü her şeye ve hiçbir şeye karışıyor ve bir moda anlayışınız veya bir stilist kiralamak için paranız olmadığında, bu sorun değil. Bir etkinlikteki diğer katılımcılar için kardiyak arrest riskini taşımaz. Abbas'ın hassas zihinsel durumu göz önüne alındığında, bu bakışı hedeflemesi gereken şey her zaman ve sonsuza dek.<br/><br/>Ali Zafar<br/><br/>Bir gün, onlarca yıllık terapiden sonra Abbas, Ali Zafar'ınki gibi bir kıyafet giymeyi arzulayabilir. Ali, siyah yakalı beyaz yazlık ceketiyle bir Fransız restoranında maître d gibi görünmeye çok yaklaşmıştı, ama gömlek onu kurtarıyor, sateni boşver.

| Determining soil hydraulic properties with different wetting liquids : A thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the Degree of Master of Science at Lincoln University<br/><br/>Abstract<br/><br/>Soil hydraulic properties such as hydraulic conductivity, water retention and plant water relationships dominate the water movement processes. For example, the infiltration, evaporation and water flow within the soil. As a widespread phenomenon in soil, soil water repellency alters the soil hydraulic functions by resisting the water flow into the soils. Moreover, the hydraulic properties not only depend on the pore system of soil but also are affected by the physicochemical properties of the pore surfaces. Compared to water, ethanol is not affected by the water repellency due to its lower surface tension. The purpose of using ethanol is to eliminate the effect of soil water repellency on hydraulic properties measurements. However, applying pure ethanol into natural soil can degrade the soil organic materials and lead to changes in physical properties. Therefore, the aqueous ethanol solutions can be an alternative option. Nevertheless, the feasibility of using aqueous ethanol for determining soil liquid retention curve remains unknown. This study aims to test the feasibility of the aqueous ethanol solutions (0, 10 %, 20 %, 30 %, 40 %, 50 % and 100 % v/v) for establishing liquid retention curve under a small range of applied pressure in coarse sand samples with different wettability and organic amended natural soil (Templeton silt loam (TSL) with mushroom compost, biochar, dairy effluent, and municipal compost, the application rate was 15 % by weight). The result showed that the desorption of testing aqueous ethanol solutions compared to water was quicker by approximately 1 to 3x based on the liquid content at the same applied pressure and the time for reaching each equilibrium. The outcomes from the sand experiment suggested that when the concentration of aqueous ethanol solution was below 50 %, the losses via evaporation were less than 1% and the relative differences between testing liquid and water was lower than 10 %. However, the evaporation losses were 11.06 % and 24.6 %, and the relative differences were all around 15 % and 30 % in 50 % and 100 % ethanol solution, respectively. In contrast, the organic amendments in Templeton silt loam not only increased the water retention capability but also reduced the evaporation losses. The evaporation losses in TSL soil and TSL with organic amendments soil were with 1 % in solutions with less than 50 % ethanol content. Evaporation losses of 50 % and 100 % ethanol were 2.8 % and 2.9 %, respectively. The relative differences between water and testing liquid were similar to the sand experiment when the testing liquid concentrations were below 50 %. However, the relative differences in 50 % and 100 % ethanol solution were smaller than in the sand sample with around 10 % and 15%, respectively. Additionally, the analysis of relative difference suggested that almost all aqueous ethanol solutions had lower volumetric liquid content at the same supplied pressure compared to water, which was a reflection of the aqueous ethanol solutions desorbed faster than water under equivalent pressure. Therefore, 10 % to 40 % of ethanol solutions could be considered an alternative for determining soil hydraulic properties due to their faster desorption rate and not being affected by soil water repellency. Due to the evaporation and dissolution of organic material, aqueous ethanol solutions above 50% concentration were not suitable for coarse sand or medium-textured soil.... [Show full abstract] | Farklı ıslatma sıvıları ile toprak hidrolik özelliklerinin belirlenmesi : Lincoln Üniversitesi Yüksek Lisans Derecesi için gereksinimlerin kısmi olarak yerine getirilmesinde sunulan bir tez<br/><br/>Özet<br/><br/>Hidrolik iletkenlik, su tutma ve bitki su ilişkileri gibi toprak hidrolik özellikleri su hareket süreçlerine hakimdir. Örneğin, toprak içindeki sızma, buharlaşma ve su akışı. Toprakta yaygın bir fenomen olarak, toprak su iticiliği, topraktaki su akışına direnerek toprak hidrolik fonksiyonlarını değiştirir. Ayrıca, hidrolik özellikler sadece toprağın gözenek sistemine bağlı değildir, aynı zamanda gözenek yüzeylerinin fizikokimyasal özelliklerinden de etkilenir. Su ile karşılaştırıldığında, etanol, daha düşük yüzey gerilimi nedeniyle su iticiliğinden etkilenmez. Etanol kullanmanın amacı, toprak su iticiliğinin hidrolik özellikler ölçümleri üzerindeki etkisini ortadan kaldırmaktır. Bununla birlikte, doğal toprağa saf etanol uygulamak, toprak organik materyallerini bozabilir ve fiziksel özelliklerde değişikliklere yol açabilir. Bu nedenle, sulu etanol çözeltileri alternatif bir seçenek olabilir. Bununla birlikte, toprak sıvı tutma eğrisini belirlemek için sulu etanol kullanmanın fizibilitesi bilinmemektedir. Bu çalışma, sulu etanol çözeltilerinin (%0, 10,%20,%30,%40,%50 ve %100 v/v) farklı ıslaklık ve organik değiştirilmiş doğal toprak (TSL) mantar kompost, biyokar, süt ürünleri ve belediye kompost ile kaba kum örneklerinde uygulanan küçük bir basınç aralığı altında sıvı tutma eğrisinin oluşturulması için uygulanabilirliğini test etmeyi amaçlamaktadır, uygulama oranı ağırlıkça% 15 idi. Sonuç, sulu etanol çözeltilerinin su ile karşılaştırıldığında test edilmesinin dezorpsiyonunun, aynı uygulanan basınçtaki sıvı içeriğine ve her dengeye ulaşma süresine bağlı olarak yaklaşık 1 ila 3 kat daha hızlı olduğunu gösterdi. Kum deneyinden elde edilen sonuçlar, sulu etanol çözeltisinin konsantrasyonu% 50'nin altında olduğunda, buharlaşma yoluyla kayıpların% 1'den az olduğunu ve sıvı ve su testi arasındaki göreceli farklılıkların% 10'dan daha düşük olduğunu ileri sürdü. Bununla birlikte, buharlaşma kayıpları %11,06 ve %24,6 idi ve göreli farklılıklar sırasıyla % 50 ve % 100 etanol çözeltisinde % 15 ve % 30 civarındaydı. Buna karşılık, Templeton silt loam'daki organik değişiklikler sadece su tutma kabiliyetini arttırmakla kalmadı, aynı zamanda buharlaşma kayıplarını da azalttı. TSL toprağında ve TSL'de organik değişiklikli toprakta buharlaşma kayıpları % 50'den az etanol içeriğine sahip çözeltilerde % 1 idi. Buharlaşma kayıpları sırasıyla % 50 ve % 100 etanol % 2.8 ve % 2.9 idi. Su ve test sıvısı arasındaki bağıl farklar, test sıvısı konsantrasyonları% 50'nin altında olduğunda kum deneyine benzerdi. Bununla birlikte, %50 ve %100 etanol çözeltisindeki göreli farklılıklar, sırasıyla %10 ve %15 civarında kum örneğinden daha küçüktü. Ek olarak, göreceli fark analizi, hemen hemen tüm sulu etanol çözeltilerinin, eşdeğer basınç altında sudan daha hızlı emilen sulu etanol çözeltilerinin bir yansıması olan su ile karşılaştırıldığında aynı verilen basınçta daha düşük hacimsel sıvı içeriğine sahip olduğunu ileri sürdü. Bu nedenle, etanol çözeltilerinin %10-40'ı, daha hızlı dezorpsiyon oranı ve toprak su iticiliğinden etkilenmemesi nedeniyle toprak hidrolik özelliklerinin belirlenmesi için bir alternatif olarak düşünülebilir. Organik malzemenin buharlaşması ve dağılması nedeniyle,% 50 konsantrasyonun üzerindeki sulu etanol çözeltileri kaba kum veya orta dokulu toprak için uygun değildi.... [Tam soyut göster] |
