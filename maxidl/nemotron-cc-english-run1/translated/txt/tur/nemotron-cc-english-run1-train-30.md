Undocumented migrants have nothing. They are not allowed to work. They have no right to state benefits nor to a place to live. They are unseen and potentially the most vulnerable group in the UK today.<br/><br/>Undocumented (or irregular) migrants include those trafficked into the sex trade or for domestic servitude; they include visa overstayers; those whose asylum applications have been refused and others who have been subject to failures in the immigration system. All of these may originally have come to the UK legally.<br/><br/>'Illegal immigrants' – those imagined to have entered the country in the backs of lorries – make up a small proportion of the undocumented.<br/><br/>Indeed some sources suggest that half the estimated 120,000 undocumented children in the UK were actually born here to undocumented parents. These children are disadvantaged from birth, solely by their immigration status.<br/><br/>The blog tells the stories of the undocumented. It highlights their daily struggles and vulnerabilities, but also their strength and resilience. It's not an easy read.<br/><br/>You can access the blog via our website (bottom of right hand column on Home Page).<br/><br/>The blog has won the online category of the Speaking Together media awards. The awards were a new addition this year to the Migrant and Refugee Woman of the Year Awards celebration at the Royal Festival Hall in London as part of International Women's Day. The panel of judges – including novelist and playwright Gillian Slovo, and journalist and author, Hannah Pool – was particularly looking for work that challenged myths and stereotypes.<br/><br/>The blog has also won the Blog North Awards 2013 in the Best Writing category and was also shortlisted for an Amnesty International Media Award. | Gezinti sonrası<br/><br/>"Kağıtsız Yaşam" En İyi Yazarlık Ödülünü Kazandı<br/><br/>Len Grant tarafından oluşturulan "Kağıtsız Yaşam" adlı blog projesinde, belgesiz göçmen ailelerin ve gençlerin hikâyeleri yer alıyor.

| Sabbath School Lesson<br/><br/>In Galatians, Paul tackles issues such as freedom, the role of the law in salvation, our condition in Christ, and the nature of the Spirit-led life, as well as the age-old question, How can sinful humans be made right before a holy and just God?<br/><br/>Many scholars believe that Galatians may be the earliest of Paul's letters. It was written in A.D. 49, shortly after the famous Jerusalem Council (Acts 15). Therefore, the book may be the oldest Christian document known. As Acts and Galatians make clear, the early church found itself in a fierce battle over the nature of salvation, especially in the case of Gentiles. According to a group of Jewish believers, known as Judaizers, belief in Jesus alone was not good enough for Gentiles. Gentiles must also be circumcised and follow the laws of Moses (Acts 15:1).<br/><br/>This quarter's Bible study guide invites us to journey with the apostle Paul as he pleads with the Galatians to remain true to Jesus. It also gives us a chance to reflect on our own understanding of the truths that opened the way for Martin Luther's ultimate break with Rome and the restoration of the biblical gospel. | Şabat Okulu Dersi<br/><br/>Galatyalılar'da Pavlus, özgürlük, kurtuluşta yasanın rolü, Mesih'teki durumumuz ve Ruh'un önderliğindeki yaşamın doğası gibi konuları ele alır ve aynı zamanda asırlık şu soruyu sorar: Günahkar insanlar kutsal ve adil bir Tanrı'nın önünde nasıl doğru bir şekilde yapılabilir?<br/><br/>Birçok bilgin, Galatyalıların Pavlus'un mektuplarının en eskisi olabileceğine inanmaktadır. Ünlü Kudüs Konseyi'nden kısa bir süre sonra (Elçilerin İşleri 15) MS 49'da yazılmıştır. Bu nedenle, kitap bilinen en eski Hıristiyan belgesi olabilir. Elçilerin ve Galatyalıların açıkça belirttiği gibi, erken dönem kilisesi, özellikle de Gentiles'in durumunda, kurtuluşun doğası üzerinde şiddetli bir savaşta kendini buldu. Yahudileştiriciler olarak bilinen bir grup Yahudi inanana göre, İsa'ya olan inanç sadece uluslar için yeterli değildi. Gentile'ler de sünnet edilmeli ve Musa'nın yasalarına uymalıdır (Elçilerin İşleri 15:1).<br/><br/>Bu çeyreğin Mukaddes Kitap inceleme rehberi, Galatyalılar'a İsa'ya sadık kalmak için yalvarırken bizi havari Pavlus'la yolculuğa davet ediyor. Aynı zamanda Martin Luther'in Roma ile olan nihai kopuşunun ve İncil incilinin restorasyonunun yolunu açan gerçekleri kendi anlayışımıza yansıtma şansı verir. |

| Follow Us<br/><br/>ARE YOU AN<br/><br/>INSIDER<br/><br/>Craving Sugar? Here's What Your Body Is Trying to Tell You<br/><br/>by<br/>Byrdie<br/><br/>PHOTO:<br/><br/>Jacquemus<br/><br/>Weight gain from out-of-control cravings aside, it can be frustrating to have a constant hankering for something unhealthy and not know why. The good news is that there's usually a reason underlying that burning desire to house a bag of potato chips, or the feeling that you might actually die if you don't get a pickle rightthisinstant (even though you're not pregnant). If you're having visions of Milky Way bars, for example, it could mean that you're missing a very specific nutrient in your diet. (Yup—it's more complicated than said chocolate bar being so darn delicious.)<br/><br/>We talked to Los Angeles–based dietitian Shira Lenchewski, M.S., R.D., to get the skinny on some common food cravings, as well as what you can do to satiate the hunger without going overboard. Keep scrolling for some seriously good information!<br/><br/>If you're craving chocolate<br/><br/>It means: You could be lacking magnesium in your diet, says Lenchewski. "Magnesium is an essential mineral involved in energy production, glucose metabolism, and muscle function. This is especially true for those hitting the gym hard," she explains. Additionally, magnesium levels lower during the pre-menstrual weeks of your period, which explains why PMS so often comes with chocolate cravings.<br/><br/>Instead, reach for high-quality, low-sugar dark chocolate, which is naturally high in magnesium. "I recommend sticking to 75 per cent cocoa or higher, and pairing it with another magnesium-rich source like sunflower seeds," says Lenchewski. She suggests the chocolate brand Hu, a small-batch food company that focuses on high-quality ingredients produced locally. "It's a little pricey, but all the more reason to keep portions in check," she says. "It's my personal favourite." We're also big fans of superfood-packed Zenbunni.<br/><br/>If you're craving candy<br/><br/>It means: "Craving pure sugar is a good indication that you're running low on energy," says Lenchewski. "Think about it. What is the one thing you're itching for after a terrible night's sleep or at around 4 p.m. during a stressful workday? The answer is usually sugar because it's used as instant fuel for our body's cells."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for apples with nut butter. "If you're raiding your co-workers' candy stash, I recommend a more slow-burn carbohydrate with a source of fat or protein," says Lenchewski. "Unlike simple sugar, this will fuel your cells while avoiding the post-sugar crash. Two options that make for great pick-me-ups the next time you're craving candy: a sliced apple with your choice of nut butter, or berries with 2% unsweetened Greek yoghurt." We like quashing a sweet tooth with these addictive coconut chips, too—they're filling, free of any added sugar, and just so good.<br/><br/>If you're craving salt<br/><br/>It means: "If nothing but the saltiest pickle will do, you may not be drinking enough H2O," says Lenchewski. "Salt helps the body hold on to water, so we crave it when we're in need of fluids."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for water. "Stay hydrated, especially as we approach the summer months," she says. The next time a craving hits, try quenching it (literally) with a few refreshing glasses and you might find the urgency to sodium binge disappears. "If plain water bores you, try adding in mint, lemon, or frozen fruit to mix it up," says Lenchewski. And if that still doesn't do the trick, there's a healthier alternative to bagged chips or fries. "If you're really just craving salt after all, toasted seaweed is a great low-calorie option," she says.<br/><br/>If you're craving starchy carbs like pasta<br/><br/>It means: "Because high-carb foods boost the feel-good hormone serotonin, starch cravings can be a sign you're in need of a mood booster," says Lenchewski.<br/><br/>Instead, reach for a bath! "Bust out the Epsom salts, because it's time for some serious R+R," says Lenchewski. "Trust me. Indulging in a starch free-for-all feels really good in the moment, but it will likely bum you out more the next day." (As anyone who has ever over-indulged a pizza or pasta craving knows.) So the next time you want to dive head first into a bowl of carbs, draw a bath, light a candle, and treat yourself without any regret or dense calories.<br/><br/>If you're craving ice cream<br/><br/>5 / 6<br/><br/>It means: "Your body may be telling you it's in need of some healthy fat."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for coconut ice cream. "I'm a realist, so if you're craving ice cream, I'm not going to recommend a handful of walnuts, which are, of course, full of healthy fat," says Lenchewski. "For ice cream emergencies, I recommend lower-in-sugar coconut ice-creams like Coconut Bliss or Kippy's three-ingredient ice cream in Los Angeles." We can vouch for the fact that coconut ice cream tastes incredible and just like the real thing.<br/><br/>If you're craving a burger<br/><br/>It means: You need iron. "If you can't stop thinking about red meat, there's a chance your body is craving iron, b12 and folic acid," says Lenchewski. "This is especially true during or around that time of the month."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for a healthier burger. "I'm a proponent of grass fed, antibiotic and hormone-free red meat once a week," says Lenchewski. "Try experimenting with an open-faced bison burger—which, cut for cut, is leaner and has more iron than beef." Don't eat meat? Try to incorporate some kind of plant-based iron supplement into your routine, like spirulina. | Bizi Takip Edin<br/><br/>ARANIYOR MUSUNUZ?<br/><br/>INSIDER<br/><br/>Craving Sugar? İşte Vücudun Sana Ne Anlatmaya Çalışıyor?<br/><br/>tarafından<br/>Byrdie<br/><br/>Fotoğraf:<br/><br/>Jacquemus<br/><br/>Kontrol dışı isteklerden kilo alımı bir yana, sağlıksız bir şey için sürekli bir özlem duymak ve nedenini bilmemek sinir bozucu olabilir. İyi haber şu ki, genellikle bir paket patates cipsi barındırmak için yanma arzusunun altında yatan bir neden var ya da bir turşu almazsanız gerçekten ölebileceğiniz hissi (hamile olmamanıza rağmen). Örneğin, Samanyolu çubuklarını görüyorsanız, bu, beslenmenizde çok spesifik bir besin maddesinin eksik olduğu anlamına gelebilir. (Yup - bu, çikolata çubuğunun bu kadar lezzetli olmasından daha karmaşıktır.)<br/><br/>Los Angeles merkezli diyetisyen Shira Lenchewski, M.S., R.D. ile konuştuk, bazı ortak yiyecek özlemlerinde sıskalığın yanı sıra aşırıya kaçmadan açlığı doyurmak için neler yapabileceğinizi konuştuk. Bazı ciddi iyi bilgiler için kaydırmaya devam edin!<br/><br/>Eğer çikolata arzuluyorsan<br/><br/>Bunun anlamı: Diyetinizde magnezyum eksikliği olabilir, diyor Lenchewski. "Magnezyum enerji üretimi, glikoz metabolizması ve kas fonksiyonu ile ilgili önemli bir mineraldir. Bu özellikle spor salonuna sert vuranlar için geçerlidir," diye açıklıyor. Ek olarak, adet öncesi haftalar boyunca magnezyum seviyeleri daha düşüktür, bu da PMS'nin neden bu kadar sık çikolata özlemi ile geldiğini açıklar.<br/><br/>Bunun yerine, magnezyum bakımından doğal olarak yüksek olan yüksek kaliteli, düşük şekerli bitter çikolataya ulaşın. Lenchewski, "Yüzde 75 kakao veya daha yüksek bir kakaoya yapışmayı ve ayçiçeği tohumları gibi magnezyum açısından zengin başka bir kaynakla eşleştirmeyi öneriyorum" diyor. Yerel olarak üretilen yüksek kaliteli malzemelere odaklanan küçük bir piliç gıda şirketi olan çikolata markası Hu'yu öneriyor. "Biraz pahalı, ancak porsiyonları kontrol altında tutmak için daha fazla neden var" diyor. "Bu benim kişisel favorim." Ayrıca süper gıda dolu Zenbunni'nin büyük hayranlarıyız.<br/><br/>Eğer şeker arzuluyorsan<br/><br/>Lenchewski, "Saf şeker yakmak, enerjinizin azaldığının iyi bir göstergesidir" diyor. "Bir düşünün. Korkunç bir gece uykusundan sonra veya stresli bir iş günü boyunca saat 4 civarında kaşındığınız tek şey nedir? Cevap genellikle şekerdir, çünkü vücudumuzun hücreleri için anlık yakıt olarak kullanılır.<br/><br/>Lenchewski, bunun yerine fındık ezmesi ile elmalara uzanın. "İş arkadaşlarınızın şekerleme zulasına baskın yapıyorsanız, yağ veya protein kaynağı olan daha yavaş yanan bir karbonhidrat tavsiye ederim" diyor. Basit şekerden farklı olarak, bu, şeker sonrası çarpışmadan kaçınırken hücrelerinizi yakıtlandıracaktır. Bir dahaki sefere şeker istediğinde harika pick-me-up'lar için iki seçenek: fındık ezmesi seçimine sahip dilimlenmiş bir elma veya% 2 şekersiz Yunan yoğurdu olan meyveler. Biz de bu bağımlılık yapan hindistancevizi cipsleri ile tatlı bir dişi kesmeyi severiz - herhangi bir ilave şekerden arınmış ve çok iyi doldurulurlar.<br/><br/>Eğer tuz arzuluyorsan<br/><br/>Lenchewski: "En tuzlu turşudan başka bir şey yapmazsa, yeterince H2O içmiyor olabilirsiniz," diyor Lenchewski. "Tuz vücudun suya tutunmasına yardımcı olur, bu yüzden sıvılara ihtiyaç duyduğumuzda onu arzularız."<br/><br/>Bunun yerine, su için uzanın. "Sulu kalın, özellikle yaz aylarına yaklaşırken," diyor. Bir dahaki sefere bir özlem vurduğunda, birkaç ferahlatıcı bardakla söndürmeyi deneyin ve sodyum aşırılığının ortadan kaybolmasının aciliyetini bulabilirsiniz. Lenchewski, "Sade su sizi sıkıyorsa, karıştırmak için nane, limon veya donmuş meyve eklemeyi deneyin" diyor. Ve eğer bu hala işe yaramazsa, torbalanmış cips veya kızartmalara daha sağlıklı bir alternatif var. "Eğer gerçekten sadece tuz arzuluyorsanız, kızarmış yosun harika bir düşük kalorili seçenektir" diyor.<br/><br/>Makarna gibi nişastalı karbonhidratları özlüyorsanız<br/><br/>Lenchewski, "Yüksek karbonhidratlı gıdalar, iyi hissettiren hormon serotonini arttırdığı için, nişasta istekleri bir ruh hali güçlendiriciye ihtiyaç duyduğunuzun bir işareti olabilir" diyor.<br/><br/>Bunun yerine, banyoya uzanın! "Epsom tuzlarını söndürün, çünkü ciddi bir R + R zamanı," diyor Lenchewski. "Güven bana. Nişastasız bir nişastaya dalmak şu anda gerçekten iyi hissettiriyor, ancak muhtemelen ertesi gün sizi daha fazla kızdıracak." (Bir pizza ya da makarna özlemini abartan herkesin bildiği gibi.) Bu yüzden bir dahaki sefere kafanızı bir kase karbonhidrata daldırmak istiyorsanız, bir banyo çizin, bir mum yakın ve herhangi bir pişmanlık ya da yoğun kalori olmadan kendinizi tedavi edin.<br/><br/>Eğer dondurma arzuluyorsan<br/><br/>5 / 6<br/><br/>Anlamı: "Bedeniniz size sağlıklı bir yağa ihtiyacı olduğunu söylüyor olabilir."<br/><br/>Bunun yerine, hindistan cevizi dondurmasına uzanın. Lenchewski, "Ben bir realistim, bu yüzden dondurma özlemi çekiyorsanız, elbette sağlıklı yağlarla dolu bir avuç ceviz önermeyeceğim," diyor. "Dondurma acil durumlar için, Coconut Bliss veya Kippy'nin Los Angeles'taki üç bileşenli dondurması gibi daha düşük şekerli hindistan cevizi dondurmalarını tavsiye ederim." Hindistan cevizi dondurmasının inanılmaz ve gerçek bir şey gibi tadı olduğuna kefil olabiliriz.<br/><br/>Eğer bir burger arzuluyorsanız<br/><br/>Bunun anlamı: Demire ihtiyacınız var. "Kırmızı et hakkında düşünmeyi bırakamıyorsanız, vücudunuz demir, b12 ve folik asit istiyor olabilir" diyor Lenchewski. "Bu özellikle ayın o zamanında veya civarında geçerlidir."<br/><br/>Lenchewski, bunun yerine, daha sağlıklı bir hamburgere uzanın. "Ben haftada bir kez otla beslenen, antibiyotik ve hormonsuz kırmızı etin savunucusuyum," diyor Lenchewski. "Açık yüzlü bir bizon burger ile deney yapmayı deneyin - kesim için kesilmiş, daha yalın ve sığır etinden daha fazla demire sahiptir." Et yemeyin? Spirulina gibi rutininize bir çeşit bitki bazlı demir takviyesi dahil etmeye çalışın. |

Spoiler alert: This brain teaser is entirely solvable. Scroll down to read the puzzle, and to get the answer. Good luck!<br/><br/>Here's The Puzzle<br/><br/>Alice and Bob are each told a number, but neither knows the other's number. Both of the numbers are positive and consecutive. In the room with Alice and Bob, there is a clock that dings every minute. Someone can guess the other's number only at the ding of that clock, but they can also remain silent. If someone correctly guesses the other's number on the first try, both people $1 million.<br/><br/>There is a way to win without any form of communication between Alice and Bob, and, duh, without cheating. It's completely logical and can guarantee a win on the first try. How can they do it? Watch the video below to find out.<br/><br/>The Seemingly Impossible Guess The Number Puzzle<br/><br/>Share the knowledge!<br/><br/>Here's The Answer<br/><br/>Suppose Alice is told the number N. She hears the clock ding N-1 times, so she knows that Bob was told N+1. Therefore, on the next ding, she can correctly guess Bob's secret number. If we're dealing with small numbers, however, it can be played differently. If Alice was told 1, she knows Bob was told 2 because 0 is not a positive (or negative) number.

Saatin N-1 sesini duyuyor, bu yüzden Bob'a N+1 dendiğini biliyor. Bu nedenle, bir sonraki ding'de Bob'un gizli numarasını doğru bir şekilde tahmin edebilir. Bununla birlikte, küçük sayılarla uğraşıyorsak, farklı oynanabilir. Alice'e 1 söylendiyse, Bob'a 2 dendiğini biliyor çünkü 0 pozitif (veya negatif) bir sayı değil.

| Web Services, Vendors And Cyber Laws!<br/><br/>Updated On:April 21, 2014Bilal Ahmad<br/><br/>Computerization of this world changed human performance scenario to a great extent and that too beyond measurement. For instance, Now you can send vital information all across the globe with a single mouse click, thanks to internet connectivity. Sadly, it is this wide connectivity and popularity among people, internet has also increased chances for computer crimes. Internet crimes or computer crimes are widely known as 'Cyber Crimes'.<br/><br/>'Cyber Laws' is something new in the judiciary system but has gained a lot of attention lately. The term cyber crime is something very synonymous with conventional crime, the only difference being medium of execution. There are majorly two types of cyber crimes, the first one is in which computers are the main targets and these include cases of data damage, malicious code and even criminal data access. The second one is in which computer is only a tool using which conventional crimes are committed for eg cyber terrorism, spamming, cyber stalking and many more.<br/><br/>This is where a website consultant or a vendor comes into scene. Although not aware of all the cyber laws present till date, a website vendor can advise you on some of the most vital cyber laws while creating your site.<br/><br/>This may include common knowledge of copy rights or even protecting the content of your own website. Explaining you all the rights you posses as a website owner is also one the tasks a website vendor may do while developing your website. A vendor can also assist you by offering you information on different cyber laws to protect data. Besides all of this, a vendor can also offer you information on any new cyber law that you may not be aware of till know. Cyber laws may vary from nation to nation, one recent example can be of the cookie law released in the United Kingdom, which prevents the website from saving any user browsing data. As per the Cookie Law, websites in the United Kingdom cannot save cookie files without informational consent from the surfer.<br/><br/>It is after the implementation of such law, websites now have a pop-up window, which seeks the consent of the visitor for saving cookies files. Such files are used by websites to analyze the browsing pattern of visitors based on which advertisements are then posted on a user window. With hacking not anymore a new thing for all of us, do you think such rules and regulations can prevent online forgery or cyber crime? Technology has developed at a rapid rate but still people do not prefer shopping online due to fear of personal or bank account details getting hacked. With the rise of cyber crime, need of stringent cyber laws have also increased to curb the same and to promote a risk free shopping experience.<br/><br/>Classes of Cyber Crimes<br/><br/>Over the years there have been three major classes of cyber crimes:<br/><br/>Unauthorized access of computer system cases, which involves hacking or stealing usernames and passwords to gain access over personal information of the respective user. These kind of backdoor access are organized with the help of Trojan Horse. Releasing malicious programs like Trojan House, worms or computer viruses etc. The last class includes cyber stalking a user or online harassment .<br/><br/>Direct implications of Cyber crimes<br/><br/>Decrease in sales<br/><br/>Decrease in staff output due to network delays<br/><br/>Loss of personalized information like research work<br/><br/>Disruption in communication process<br/><br/>Indirect implications of Cyber crimes<br/><br/>Credibility issue in our financial system<br/><br/>Brand image is tarnished in the market<br/><br/>Cyber crimes affect business to business relationship in the market<br/><br/>Sense of trust in state policies and government agencies is lost<br/><br/>Preventing Cyber Crime<br/><br/>As netizens there are certain precautions that we should consider for a safe and secure online experience. Here are some of them:<br/><br/>First thing to do will be to keep personal information to your self and avoid sharing the same online.<br/><br/>Avoid sharing any photographs with online chat friends or strangers.<br/><br/>Installing latest version of anti-virus on your system can offer you a good line of defense against internet threats like viruses and malware.<br/><br/>Keeping back up of your valuable data is a good option to avoid problems like virus contamination.<br/><br/>Avoid sending credit card information to sites that are unsecured and don't have any valid certificate.<br/><br/>Installing safety programme that offers you control over site cookies and saves you from being tracked by websites.<br/><br/>Putting host-based intrusions detection devices on servers will help you keep track of irregularities on your website traffic.<br/><br/>Use of firewall is advised.<br/><br/>Why Cyber attacks are so popular?<br/><br/>Cheaper than traditional cheating methods<br/><br/>Tracking cyber crimes are not easy<br/><br/>Exact locations cannot be tracked easily<br/><br/>Absence of physical barrier in the internet world<br/><br/>Cyber crimes affect large number of people<br/><br/>Conclusion<br/><br/>The fact that human mind has unfathomable power is undeniable, which is why internet crimes are increasing at a tremendous rate. Even history has witnessed some of the greatest internet security gone kaput by the hands of hackers, who have easily got away too. The only way to curb such crime is to remain aware of the cyber laws that we have today, that can either be through internet or through website/IT vendors. Information Technology Act has to be balanced in such a way that it proves too stringent for people who are involved in cyber crimes and at the same time it should never hamper the growth of Internet industry.<br/><br/>Author Bio:– Maneet Puri at present is heading a quality web design firm located at New Delhi, India. With unmatchable expertise in technical domain, he has been offering professional web consultation services to his clients located all round the globe. He is also an avid writer and some of his commended work have been published on renowned websites | Web Hizmetleri, Satıcılar ve Siber Yasalar!<br/><br/>Güncelleme Tarihi:Nisan 21, 2014Bilal Ahmad<br/><br/>Bu dünyanın bilgisayarlaştırılması, insan performans senaryosunu büyük ölçüde değiştirdi ve bu da ölçülemenin çok ötesinde. Örneğin, şimdi internet bağlantısı sayesinde tek bir fare tıklaması ile tüm dünyada hayati bilgiler gönderebilirsiniz. Ne yazık ki, insanlar arasında bu geniş bağlantı ve popülerlik, internet aynı zamanda bilgisayar suçları için şansını artırdı. İnternet suçları veya bilgisayar suçları yaygın olarak 'Siber Suçlar' olarak bilinir.<br/><br/>'Siber Yasalar' yargı sisteminde yeni bir şey, ancak son zamanlarda çok ilgi gördü. Siber suç terimi, geleneksel suçla çok eşanlamlı bir şey, tek fark infaz aracıdır. Başlıca iki tür siber suç vardır, bunlardan birincisi bilgisayarların ana hedef olduğu ve bunların veri hasarı, kötü amaçlı kod ve hatta cezai veri erişimi vakalarını içerdiğidir. İkincisi, bilgisayarın yalnızca geleneksel suçların siber terörizm, spam, siber takip ve daha birçok şey için işlendiği bir araç olduğu.<br/><br/>Bu, bir web sitesi danışmanının veya bir satıcının sahneye çıktığı yerdir. Bugüne kadar mevcut olan tüm siber yasaların farkında olmasa da, bir web sitesi satıcısı, sitenizi oluştururken en hayati siber yasaların bazıları hakkında size tavsiyelerde bulunabilir.<br/><br/>Bu, kopya hakları hakkındaki ortak bilgileri veya hatta kendi web sitenizin içeriğini korumayı içerebilir. Bir web sitesi sahibi olarak sahip olduğunuz tüm hakları açıklamak, bir web sitesi satıcısının web sitenizi geliştirirken yapabileceği görevlerden biridir. Bir satıcı, verileri korumak için size farklı siber yasalar hakkında bilgi sunarak da size yardımcı olabilir. Tüm bunların yanı sıra, bir satıcı size farkında olmadığınız yeni siber yasalar hakkında da bilgi sunabilir. Siber yasalar ulustan ulusa değişebilir, son bir örnek, web sitesinin herhangi bir kullanıcı tarama verisini kaydetmesini engelleyen Birleşik Krallık'ta yayınlanan çerez yasası olabilir. Cookie Kanunu'na göre, Birleşik Krallık'taki web siteleri, sörfçüden bilgi sahibi olmadan çerez dosyalarını kaydedemez.<br/><br/>Bu tür yasaların uygulanmasından sonra, web sitelerinin artık çerez dosyalarını kaydetmek için ziyaretçinin rızasını isteyen bir açılır pencere vardır. Bu tür dosyalar, web siteleri tarafından, hangi reklamların daha sonra bir kullanıcı penceresinde yayınlandığına bağlı olarak ziyaretçilerin tarama düzenini analiz etmek için kullanılır. Hackleme artık hepimiz için yeni bir şey değil, bu tür kural ve düzenlemelerin çevrimiçi sahteciliği veya siber suçu önleyebileceğini düşünüyor musunuz? Teknoloji hızlı bir şekilde gelişti, ancak yine de insanlar kişisel veya banka hesap bilgilerinin hacklenmesi korkusu nedeniyle çevrimiçi alışveriş yapmayı tercih etmiyorlar. Siber suçun artmasıyla birlikte, sıkı siber yasalara olan ihtiyaç da aynı şeyi frenlemek ve risksiz bir alışveriş deneyimini teşvik etmek için artmıştır.<br/><br/>Siber Suçlar Sınıfları<br/><br/>Yıllar boyunca siber suçların üç ana sınıfı olmuştur:<br/><br/>İlgili kullanıcının kişisel bilgileri üzerinden erişim elde etmek için kullanıcı adlarını ve şifrelerini hacklemeyi veya çalmayı içeren bilgisayar sistemi vakalarının yetkisiz erişimi. Bu tür arka kapı erişimi Truva Atı yardımıyla düzenlenir. Trojan House, solucanlar veya bilgisayar virüsleri gibi kötü amaçlı programların serbest bırakılması vb. Son sınıf, bir kullanıcıyı veya çevrimiçi tacizi siber takip etmeyi içerir.<br/><br/>Siber suçların doğrudan sonuçları<br/><br/>Satışlarda azalma<br/><br/>Ağ gecikmeleri nedeniyle personel çıktısında azalma<br/><br/>Araştırma çalışmaları gibi kişiselleştirilmiş bilgilerin kaybı<br/><br/>İletişim sürecinde bozulma<br/><br/>Siber Suçların Dolaylı Etkileri<br/><br/>Finansal Sistemimizde Güvenilirlik Sorunu<br/><br/>Marka imajı piyasada lekelendi<br/><br/>Siber suçlar, iş ilişkilerini piyasadaki iş ilişkilerine etkiler<br/><br/>Devlet politikalarına ve devlet kurumlarına olan güven duygusu kayboldu<br/><br/>Siber Suçların Önlenmesi<br/><br/>Netizenler olarak güvenli ve güvenli bir çevrimiçi deneyim için göz önünde bulundurmamız gereken bazı önlemler vardır. İşte bunlardan bazıları:<br/><br/>Yapılacak ilk şey, kişisel bilgilerinizi kendinize saklamak ve aynı şeyi çevrimiçi olarak paylaşmaktan kaçınmak olacaktır.<br/><br/>Çevrimiçi sohbet arkadaşlarınızla veya yabancılarla herhangi bir fotoğraf paylaşmaktan kaçının.<br/><br/>Sisteminize anti-virüsün en son sürümünü yüklemek, virüs ve kötü amaçlı yazılım gibi internet tehditlerine karşı iyi bir savunma hattı sunabilir.<br/><br/>Değerli verilerinizi yedeklemek, virüs kontaminasyonu gibi sorunlardan kaçınmak için iyi bir seçenektir.<br/><br/>Kredi kartı bilgilerini güvenli olmayan ve geçerli bir sertifikaya sahip olmayan sitelere göndermekten kaçının.<br/><br/>Site çerezleri üzerinde kontrol etmenizi sağlayan ve sizi web siteleri tarafından izlenmekten koruyan güvenlik programı yüklemek.<br/><br/>Sunuculara ana bilgisayar tabanlı saldırı tespit cihazları koymak, web sitesi trafiğinizdeki düzensizlikleri takip etmenize yardımcı olacaktır.<br/><br/>Firewall kullanımı tavsiye edilir.<br/><br/>Siber saldırılar neden bu kadar popüler?<br/><br/>Geleneksel hile yöntemlerinden daha ucuz<br/><br/>Siber suçları takip etmek kolay değil<br/><br/>Kesin konumlar kolayca takip edilemez<br/><br/>İnternet dünyasında fiziksel engelin yokluğu<br/><br/>Siber suçlar çok sayıda insanı etkiliyor<br/><br/>Sonuç<br/><br/>İnsan aklının akıl almaz bir güce sahip olması inkar edilemez, bu yüzden internet suçları muazzam bir oranda artmaktadır. Tarih bile, en büyük internet güvenliğinin, kolayca kaçan bilgisayar korsanlarının eline geçtiğine tanık oldu. Bu tür suçları engellemenin tek yolu, bugün sahip olduğumuz siber yasaların farkında olmak, internet üzerinden veya web sitesi / BT satıcıları aracılığıyla olabilir. Bilgi Teknolojisi Yasası, siber suçlara karışan insanlar için çok katı olduğunu ve aynı zamanda İnternet endüstrisinin büyümesini engellememesi gerektiğini kanıtlayacak şekilde dengelenmelidir.<br/><br/>Author Bio: - Maneet Puri şu anda Yeni Delhi, Hindistan'da bulunan kaliteli bir web tasarım firmasına başkanlık ediyor.
